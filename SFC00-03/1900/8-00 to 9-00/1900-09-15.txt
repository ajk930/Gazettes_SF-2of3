. NEW ORLEANS. Sept. I4.-0ne of the
most pathetic stories of suffering in Gal
veston was . learned to-day when the
Southern Pacific train arrived from Hous
ton. Among the passengers were Mrs.
Mary Quayle of Liverpool. England, and
Jonathan Hale of Gloversvllle. N. T.
Mrs. Quayle went- from New York to Gal
veston, arriving- there Thursday, accom
panied by* her husband, Edward Quayle,
a tabulator- on - the Liverpool Cotton Ex
change. Mrs. Quayle and her husband
took apartment* In tfce Lucas terrace, a
fashionable place In the eastern end of tha
Island. During the stotm Saturday even
ing, while Mr. Quayle was peering out of
the window, there camp an unusually vio
lent fit of wind and the window was lit
erally sucked put as if by a mighty air
pump And he was taken with it. Mrs.
Quayle was thrown in the opposite direc
tion against the door of the room. When
she came to her senses she began to call
for her husband. Mr. Hale, who occupied
the adjoining room, came to her assist
ance and cared for her until dawn Sun
day. Then they went out together and
searched throughout all the adjacent por
tion of the city for her husband, but no
trance of him was found. The search was
kept up until Monday night without suc
cess. Then Mr. Hale brought Mrs. Quayle
via Houston to New Orleans and they
took a train for New York. Mrs. Quayle

- DALLAS, Sept. -14. â This evening a sec
ond train left Dallas carrying 55000 worth
of supplies purchased with the funds sub
scribed by readers of the New York Her
ald. This train runs over the Gulf. Colo
rado and Santa Fe Railroad to its pres

north of Galveston. The train Is under es
cort of a detachment of .Trezevant's Rifles
cf Dallas, with Lieutenant Miers in com

This consignment of supplies is intend

is known as the "Coast country." This
will be the fir^t newspaper relief train to
reach this particular part of the stricken

articles of wearing apparel for boys and
girls, men and women. Every age was
provided for. All classes were treated

SS years, who was residing at Virginia
Point, two miles from Galveston.
AUSTIN, Tex., Sept. 14.â The destitution and suffering in the smaller towns and country districts on
the mainland that -were swept by the storm is greater. than indicated in the earlier reports. Many
applications for aid were received from those points to-dny by Governor Sayers. Hon. Lewis Bryan,
a prominent citizen of Velasco, came here in person and had a conference with the Governor con
cerning the terrible condition of affairs in that section. He stated that there are over 8OOO destitute
people in Brazoria County who are now suffering for food and clothing. He estimates that over 80 per
cent of the houses in that county were destroyed by the storm. All the other buildings were damaged.
There are over 2OOO homeless people in the town of Columbia and immediate neighborhood. Many people
were killed in the country districts, but the loss of life was confined mostly to negroes. Prosperous plan
tations have been completely devastated, farm buildings are all gone and all crops destroyed. The home
less and hungry people of Richmond, Alvin, Angelton, Seabrooke, and other places are crying for aid.
Food and clothing are wanted. Medical aid is also badly needed in some of the smaller places. In
response to these appeals the Governor to-day ordered the forwarding of the following shipments of food
supplies: To Alvin, 50,000 pounds of flour and 25.OOO pounds of bacon; to Velasco, 50,000 pounds of
bacon and 100,000 pounds of flour; to Angelton, 100,000 pounds of bacon and 200,000 pounds of
flour; to Richmond, for ths sufferers in Fort Bend County, 200,000 pounds of. flour and 25,000 pounds
of bacon. He also ordered 200,000 pounds of flour and 100,000 pounds of bacon shipped to Galveston.
Relief committees are being organized at all the smaller towns and their requests will be filled
as promptly as possible. Captain L. P. Seiker, quartermaster of the Texas Bangers, reached Alvin this
morning and reports that the suffering there is very great. He has charge of the relief work at that
place. The losses to the farmers of the storm , belt ; is beyond computation. It is too late to put in another
cane or cotton crop and all their year's work has gone for naught. A letter was received from Mayor
John Bryan of Juintana Station saying part .of that city, was destroyed andthat the place was covered
with ruins. The wreckage is in the form of drifts and extends for over a mile in length. These drifts are
made up of housahold effects, logs and timbers. He reports no destitution and it is supposed that the
people are bsing well taken care of.
Great Destitution and Suffering in Smaller
Towns and Country Districts on
Good Progress Made in Clearing
Away the Debris at Galves
ton, Which Will Be Rapidly
Reconstructed.
The relief committees are steadily broadening the scope of their work. They
have established bureaus for the issuance of orders and rations in every ward,
and though there is a multiutde surrounding every bureau, applicants are rapidly
being laken care of. There seems no present likelihood of inability on the part
cf the committee to furnish all the rations that are asked for. There is, of
course, a scarcity of fresh beef and of milk, but bread is being provided' in
abundance, as well as hams, potatoes, rice and other articles.
The sympathy felt for Galveston throughout the world was again evidenced
this morning, when local bankers were notified by cable that the Liverpool
Cotton Exchange had subscribed Â£1000 for the relief of the sufferers, and that
more will follow.
One of the most remarkable escapes recorded during the flood was reported
to-day, when news came that a United States batteryman on duty at the forts
last week had beon picked up on Morgans Point wounded, but alive. He had
buffeted the waves for five days and lived through a terrible experience. Mor
gans Point Is thirty miles from Galvestcn.
lists of the living and of the dead are far from perfect. The identity of all
who have been lost will never be known. The names sent out from here have
been gathered with scrupulous care, but at the same time many errors are
fpuno 1 In them.
Much attention has been attracted by the dispatch of Quartermaster Bax
ter to the department expressing the belief that Galveston has been hopelessly
ruined.' Congressman Hawley last night sent the following telegram to the War
Department in reply to the dispatches of Quartermaster Baxter: *
"While it might not be significant or worthy of notice, I have the honor to
Â«tate that Quartermaster Baxter's telegrarr to the quartermaster general re
flecting Galvtston is unworthy of- a eoldier and In no way represents the mor
ale of GalveFton citizenship and their determined purpose to restore their city."
The Cotton Exchange building proved to be one of the strongest during the
rturcn. Window!" were Fmasbed on every floor and on every side and much,dam
age was done to the cotton rooms and the various' offices In the building, but no
portion of the walls or roof gave way.

BROAD SCOPE OF RELIEF WORK-
Shipping znrn say to-day that the damage to the wharves is by no means as
serious as at first supposed. The chief damage has been in the tearing open of
sheds and the ripping of planking. The sheds, however, can be quickly replaced.
The I'iling for a considerable distance along the bay front successfully withstood
the poundir.fr it got from the wind and waves and business men find a measure of
consolation In this.
More hopeful reports were received to-day touching the water supply. The
company is placing men all along the mains plugging the broken places and
thereby assisting: the flow. It was serving some of its customers to-day, and
hopes gradually to increase the service. The water continues to run by grav
ity prefsurr-. The only dilficulty the people are having is in carrying supplies to
their homes or places of business. The Ice supply continues bountiful, and at
many corners lemonacle is being Â«orved.
More effective measures were taken to-day to keep certain people off the
island. The j=oMionÂ« patrolkd the water front and challenged all who could not
show a. proper reason for their landing or who were unwilling- to work for the priv
ilege of coming into town.
Assurances have boon received from the railroads that they will do all in their
power to reopen communication, and their present plan seems to be to concen
trate all forces on the work of reconstruction of one bridge. Crews are coming
down the Santa Fe Railroad from Arkansas and St., Louis with full equipment to
restore the line. Local representatives of the Southern Pacific have had advices
from headquarters to proceed with repair work without delay. â¢
Telegraph communication has been partly restored, the 'Western Union and
Postal having reached the city with one wire each. Large forcea have been at
â¢work along the lines of both companies and connection with Galveston has been
attended with many difficulties.
A larger number of business houses than on yesterday are open and adver
tising their wares at no advance in price. Carts with disinfectants are going
through the streets. The gutters are being covered with lime. Carpenters are
having all the work they can do. The storm tore hundreds of roofs off, and the
people who are living In topless houses are eager to obtain coverings,' bo as to
prevent the destruction of what they have saved if a rainstorm comes along.
Thus far, however, the weather has been clear and there are no immediate in
dications of a downpour.
MORE HOPEFUL REPORTS MADE.
GALVESTON. Sept. 14â The first real attempt to clear away the great
mass cf debris piled along the beach front for a distance of several miles
â¢rai Ixsun to-day. Advertisements were printed in the News, which
fci j>"ared th!*- morninp. asking for hundreds of men and boys to do the
work. A niultitu-le responded. They were formed into squads and
promptly put. to work with police and deputy sheriffs in charge. It is
hop<-<3 thr.t a. vigorous prosecution of this work Â¦will lead to the early recovery of
bod!*-* still in the tfebris. That there are many of them there is no shadow of.
doubt. It is difficult indeed to imagine how half the people that did escape got tree
of this fearful flotsam and jetsam.
An Associated Press representative traversed the beach for some distance to
day and the stench at different points was absolutely sickening:. Everywhere lit
tle groups of men, women and children, some of them poorly provided with
raiment, were digging in the ruins of their homes for what little household prop
erty they could save. In many cases those seeking their former residences were
utterly unable to find a single remnant of them, so hopeless is the confusion of
timbers and household furniture.
The exodus of people from the city was heavy to-day and hundreds were eager
to jro, but unable to secure transportation. Alcng the bay front there were scores
of families with dejected faces pleading to be taken from the stricken city,
where, in spite of even" effort to restore confidence, there is a universal feeling
of depression.
Governor Sayers Receives Fur
ther Subscriptions, Which
Now Amount to Nearly a
Million and a Half.
', a V . USTIN, Tex., Sept. 14.â At a conference between Governor Sayers and
a committee from Galveston It was decided that instead of looking to
Zjk the. laboring people of "Galveston for work in thl3 emergency aa Im-
portation of uutslde laborer* to the number of 2O0O should be made to
conduct the sanitary work while the people of Galveston were given an
opportunity of looking after their own losses and rebuilding their own
property, without giving any time to the city at large. It is believed that with
these 20C0 outside laborers it will require about four weeks to clean the city of
debris, and in the meantime the citizens can be working on their own property
and repairing damage there.
During* the day the Governor received a large number of subscrip
tions and it is estimated that the total subscription lists to date, here
and at Galveston, will reach $1,300,000.
Governor Sayers says that as soon as possible he will prepare a list of sub
scriptions by States and give it out. During the day Governor Sayers ordered a
trainload of provisions to be sent from Dallas to Galvestcn and also ordered
provisions and clothing sent from San Antonio.
During the day Governor Sayers received information from the penitentiary
authorities at the convict farm on Clemens' plantation near Velasco that eight
een convicts had been drowned or killed during the storm and two others were
badly injured. - The penitentiary official estimates that the share farms of the
State have been injured $109,000.

H ALVESTON, Sept. 14.-â No less than 2701 names of the deadâ victims of wind and waveâ have been compiled. There were hundreds of bodies buried in the
vJ sea and in the sand, where no identification was possible. Other hundreds were buried on the beach of the mainland, few of whom have been identified.
Some bodies are still in the ruins and scattered along the beach of the mainland and in the marshes, where. they were thrown by the water. Some of these
bodies have been sent twenty miles inland along small watercourses by the rush 4 of high water. Taking all things into consideration there seems no longer any
doubt that the number of dead will reach beyond the estimate of 5000 which has been made by Mayor Jones and other reliable citizens of Galveston.

pressing down and from now on
its rehabilitation- will be sure, and if
money will be received it will be rapid.
At a meeting of the Galveston relief com
mittee held yesterday afternoon a com
mittee of three, consisting of Major
Thomas Gore, Frank Spencer and J. D.
Skinner, was appointed for the purpose of
proceeding to Austin and conferring with
Governor Sayers as to the best methods
to be pursued in relieving the distress in
the city. The committee was appointed
at the request of Governor Sayers, who
desired the aid of Galveston in devising
the best and most practicable means of
relief.
The local Board of Health, through Dr.
H. A. West, its secretary, has made a
demand that the work of clearing up 4he
dwelling houses be turned over to physi
cians. This work, in common with the
other branches of cleaning the city, has
been under the direction of Adjutant
General Scurry, and he has proved him
self so capable that the relief committee
declined to make any division of respon
sibility, and the doctors were told that
they could not have the work.
Notwithstanding the fact that the num
ber of boats carrying passengers between
Texas City and Galveston has been large
ly Increased, it was impossible yesterday
to leave the city after the early morning
hours, and hundreds of men, women and
children, all anxious to depart, suffered
great inconvenience and hardship, and
were after all compelled to sleep upon the
beach at Texas City, . waiting for" the
morning:
There is but one steamer plying across
Galveston Bay which is able to carry, pas
sengers in any number, and even this
boat is able to make ,the_ trip only with
extreme ; caution on account of the shal
lownass of the bay. Yesterday ;â¢ morning
somebody lacked something of being^cau
tious in the extreme and the 'Lawrence,
Jamming her nose in the mud, remained
aground ail das'. Her passengers , were
taken off in small boats, but all day long
the Lawrence remained hard and fast
aground. .This compelled those who were
unable to come on the, rtrst trip of the
Lawrence' to trust themselves to sailboats,
and J by 'noon a dozen of them, heavily
loaded, started from Galveston for Texas
City. When the fleet was scattered over
Galveston Bay by a distance of anywhere
between one mile j and three , miles, the
wind died away . utterly. Â¦ There . was not
a puff of air. The boats could neither go
on to Texas City nor return to Galveston,
and all through the afternoon they lay
motionless upon the glassy water. None
of them had more than a meager supply
of water and food, as the trip ordi
narily does not require above an hour.
The supply of water. was soon exhausted,
the sun beat down' with a merciless se
verity and in a short time babies' and
children who were but little else than ba
bies became ill, and In many , instances
their mothers were also prostrated.' There
was absolutely no relief to bo had, as the
tugs of Galveston Bay which might have
given the sloops tow are all made for
deep-sea work and draw too much water
to al'.ow of their crossing the shallow
channel. Hour after hour the people on
the boats, all of which were densely pack
ed, were comr>elled to broil in the tor
turing, blinding* sun without the slightest
current of air to render their situation
more bearable. All the afternoon they
were becalmed, and a slight breeze aris
ing in the evening, at 9 o'clock -at night
the sailing craft which had left Galveston
at noon began to dump their passengers
upon the beach at Texas City.
This place, never 'worthy of notice upon
any map, is now among the things that
once were. There is no house, no tents,
r.o accommodations of any kind save a
few passenger coaches standing. upon the
railroad track." /These were speedily, filled
and for the balance of the night women
and children, all hungry and the latter
crying for food, were compelled to remain
on the beach. An urgent message -was
sent to , the railway , at Houston saying
that women, nnd; children .were suffering,
andL asklnc them -to hurry' a : train to

Rear Admiral Bradford to Mabe a
Bequest to Congress for a
Heavy Appropriation.
Special Dispatch to The CalL . *
WASHINGTON, Sept. 14.â In his forth
coming annual report Rear Admiral
Bradford, chief of the Bureau of Equip
ment will recommend that an appropria
tion bo made sufficient to make an ad
vance in equipment of vessels of the navy
with the wireless telegraph syBtem. f; "v
According to reports received by the
Navy Department, every maritime nation
of Europe has been experimenting with
wireless telegraph for its naval service,
and the Uritish nation has gone so far as
to make arrangements for equipping
thirtv-two of its vessela,with these in
struments". The Admiralty some months
auo authorized the expenditure of nearly
&0 000 in wireless telegraphy experiments,
rmd excellent results have been attained.
The Marconi system Is not now employed
bv the English service, and while the- sys
tem in use is not as satisfactory it is yet
of great value. During the August ma
neuvers of the squadron a disturbance of
the instruments on a vessel of one of the
fleets was found to be due to the presence,
out of telescopic range, of a hostile squad
ron This Government has been endeav
oring to educate navar officers, In operat
ing wireless telegraph instruments, and
the system has been installed at the New
port naval station. -^
The results were not entirely satisfac
torv, as on account of limited funds Ad
miral Bradford was not able to purchase
improved Instruments. It is expected he
wlfi as# Congress to appropriate at least
$25,000, which will be . used to develop a
practical system. .

WARRING BOERS TO BE
TREATED AS OUTLAWS
LONDON, Sept. 14.â The following dis
patch has been received at the War Offioe
from Lord Roberts:
MACHADODORP, Sept. 13.â Krugw ha* fled
to Lourenzo Marques and Botha has been
obliged to give over the command of th* Boer
army temporarily to Vlljoen, on account of ill
health. In consequence of this I have circu
lated a Droclamation as follows:
"The late President- Kruger, with Reltz and
the archives of the South African republic, has
crossed the Portuguese frontier and arrived at
Lourenzo Marques, with the view of sailing for
Europe at an early date. Kruger has formally
resigned the position which he held as Presi
dent of the South African republic, thus sev
ering hia official connection with the Transvaal.
Kruger*s action shows how hopeless, in his
opinion, is the war which has been carried on
for nearly a year, and his desertion of tho
Boer cause should make clear to his fellow
bursrhers that It is useless to continue the
struggle any longer.
"It Is probably unknown to the Inhabitants
of the Transvaal and the Orange River Col
ony that nearly 15,000 of their fellow subjects
are now prisoners of war, not one of whom will
be released until those now under arms against
us surrender unconditionally.
"The burghers must be cognizant of the fact
that ' no intervention In their behalf can come
from any of the great powers and, further,
that tho British empire is determined to com
plete the work which has already cost so many
lives and to earn' to a conclusion the war de
clared acatnat her by tho late Government of
the - Transvaal ' and the Orange Free State, a
war to which there can be only one ending."
Lord Roberts' proclamation then points
out that with the exception of the small
area which General Botha^ is defending
the war has degenerated into irregular op
erations, which must come to an early
conclusion, and concludes:
! The means I am compelled to . adopt are
those which the customs of Â¦ war prescribe as
applicable to such cases. They are ruinous to
th<Â» country, entail endless suffering to the
burghers and their families, and the longer
'this gruerrilla warfare continues the more vig
orously miut they be enforced. .

I would not reply to the telegram

manding arbitration for the differences
! existing between the company and its
mpn. He called attention to the fact that
it was sent from Indianapolis WecLnesday
afternoon at 4:20 o'clock and was received
by him at 4:42, and that the strike order
was issued at '5:30.
"It seems to me," said Mr. Oliphant,
"that tells the whole tale. Mr. Mitchell
said this telegram was the one last effort
to settle the grievances said to exist be
tween the company and its employes. So
far as I am aware this is the first attempt
he ever made to settle the matter.
"I have always been ready to treat with
our men and am ready to do so now, but
wo have yet to learn from our men them
selves that they are dissatisfied with their
treatment. We do decline to treat with
Mr. Mitchell and the organization he rep
resents. The trouble has all been foment

"We shall all shut down the collieries
and wait for the men to return. We have
no desire to foment disorder and shall not

SHAMOKIN, Pa., Sept. 14.â A telegram
was received by John Fahey, president of
the Ninth District, United Mine Workers
of America, from Samuel Gompers, presi
dent of the Federation of Labor, an
nouncing that he would be here on Sun
day to address a mass meeting which the
strike leaders* expect to be attended by
at least 1C.000 mine workers. This is in
terpreted by the strikers to mean that a
man from the federation will assist them

SCRANTON, Pa., Sept. 14.â There is no
longer any question as to a general if not
a complete tie-up of the mines in the

day, three days before the strike order
goes into effect, 15,000 of the 33.000 miners
are on strike; twenty-one of the ninety
seven collieries are forced into ldlene&s
and by noon to-morrow the union leaders
claim the tie-up will be complete.
The one thing the * operators in . and
about Scranton mainly based their hopes
on was that the Delaware, Lackawanna
and Western miners, numbering a third
of the whole district and operating a fifth
of the collieries, would decline "to obey the
strike order. The Lackawanna' s men
have an independent union and as It was
favored by the company a majority of
thfe. employes permitted themselves to be
enrolled in It. The organization declared
against striking and the company lived in
hope that It would act in accordance with
this declaration.

one collieries that are completely shut
down nine are those of the Delaware,

who Immediately called up the President

a hifrti official of the administration sain
tonight that it contained nothing that
would in any way change the policy ol
this Government in the matter of with
drawing American troops from Pek'np.
It was also said that th>Â» message <iid not

Tientsin region reached Tuliu, on the
Grand Canal, without opposition, and the
city was occupied without a shot being
fired. Three columns converging there
vesterday. after a two days' march, found
that the 'place had already surrendered to
one officer and eight Bengal Lancers.
General Dorward ordered the town
burned after it had been thoroughly
looted. '
The villages en route made peace offer

Apparently the Boxers have disbanded in
that region, and the whole country Is

GERMAN INFORMATION
ON AMERICA'S ATTITUDE
He regretted all the recent troubles and
said he had no desire except "to smooth
them over impartially."
At another stage of the interview LI
Hung Chang said he deplored the fact
that the newspapers -were prejudiced
against him and asserted that this oppo
sition originated with the English press
of Shanghai.
The correspondent remarked that the
Americans had never been prejudiced
against him, whereupon Li Hung Chang
quickly demanded, "Why don't they ac
cept me as a negotiator?"
Questions put to Li concerning the set
tlement which the Chinese Government
wanted to make, were diplomatically par
ried. He said:
"China has her views as to what set
tlement is desirable and tho powers have
their views. We will meet and negotiate."
Askf-d whether China expected demands
for the cession of territory as indem
nity, Lf Hung Chang replied: "I am in
communication with some of the govern
ments. 1 have found that they have no
disposition to ask for land."
The correspondent said: "There is great
curiosity abroad to hear an explanation
of the contradictory edicts in the
name of the Dowager Empress during
thÂ« siege."
Li Hung, speaking deliberately, said:
"The Empress, at the beginning, was
badly advised. She was told the Boxers
had Vupernatural powers, that they could
not be injured and were able to make it
very hot for the foreigners. She be
lipvpd this, but afterward found it wa3
not true.
"The papers are incorrect In saying she
was coerced tnto Issuing edicts. The
Chinese Government is despotism. No
one can coerce the Empress. She, like all
other rulers, 1p dependent on her ad
visors, and sometimes their advice is bad
and sho may be mipled."
When the correspondent was leaving
the Interpreter raid:
"The Viceroy hoprs you will not give a
ba.l impression of him to the American
papers. He says he Is a very old manâ
the oldest to take part In these negotia
tionsâthat he ha? had much experience
!n these affairs: that he Is the only man
who can help the foreign governments as
well as the Chinese, and that he will try
and arrange a settlement fair to all
parties." .
TULIU SURRENDERS
WITHOUT OPPOSITION
SHANGHAI. Sept. 12.-L1 Hung Chang
informed a representative of. the Asso
ciated Press to-day that he will start for
Tientsui Friday, September 14, that he
will go to Peking if circumstances de
mand it and that Prince Chine arul he
had full authority from the Dowagur Em
press ana Kmperur to ntsgotiate a settle
ment with the powers, explaining that
there were no other commissioners for
China.
The audience lasted for an hour, the
correspondent being interviewed, rather
man tne Viceroy. Li asked many ques
liuns about the lighting at Tientsin, the
relief of Peking, tne number of troops ol
t-acn pov.er in ohlna, their disposition and
ihe righting qualities of the cnincse. how
PcKing was uefcnded and what bodies of
Chinese fought best. He expressed re
gret at tne privations of the women and
children in .Peking.
.During the interview LI Hung Chang
asked the correspondent if Ministers
Conger and Macdunald appeared to have
suffered much, and when told that Mr.'
Conger lost seventy pounds, he laughed
merrily and remarKea that this was a
"poor recommendation for horseflesh."
Li Hung Chang also inquired whether
the correspondent had geen much abuse of
the Chinese or any ravishing or killing
of women and children and when told
that the abuses were practically confined
to the Russians, he said this was "doubt
less due to lack of discipline," and turned
to the subject of looting, being anxious to
know how much Government treasure the
allies had o'jlained. 'When informed that
the Japanese were reported to have taken
50,000,000 taels from the revenues offices at
P.king. Lf Hung Chang said: "The rumor
must have added two ciphers to the real
amount."
Throughout the interview Li Hung

talked as one removed, by reason of his
age and experience, from the field of con
troversy.

LI HUNG CHANG WISHES
A FAIR SETTLEMENT
You remember, in 1892, when you were also
told that some men had made too much money
and wanted you to vote the capitalist down.
I am sorry to say that the country did vote,
and you got him down, but afterward we found
that the rest of us were down under him. VTe
all went downâ that was the trouble.
We have the right to appeal to you on two
grounds: In the first place, upon the ground
that our performances have squared with our
promises. Mind you, that is what <t promise is
worth. Seoond, we have the right to appeal
to you upon the ground that our opponents
FARGO, N. D., Sept. 14.-rGovernor
Roosevelt and his party of cam
paigners rested in Fargo to-night
after a day of speech-making in
this State and Almnesota. The Gov
ernor addressed two meetings in Fargo.
The first was at the opera-house, which
was the larger, and the other at the ar
mory. Preparations had been made for a
large demonstration, but rain put a stop
to the street parade and fireworks. Gov
ernor Roosevelt said at the opera-housa
in part:
This nation has gone forward with the stride
of a giant across the continent and now clasps
with her hands the islands of the sea, as the
new century is about to open. Are we, thu
heirs of ages, are we. who claim proudly that
we stand foremost among the people of the
earth, are we now to shrink back frdm what
is but a little task, a task not needing thÂ»
expenditure of more than a fraction of our
huge might? Are we. whose forefathers put
into the field a half million of men and who
fougrht to a finish the giant civil war, are we
to flinch from a lesser, a task so much less
that it Is not counted in the balance, which
cannot' be weighed when compared with the
other?
Are we to open the twentieth century by
flinching . and saying we no longer claim the
right to stand amid the great nations of the
world and perform our duty? No, the Ameri
can people cannot and will not take - such a
position. To abandon the Philippines now would
only be. to show themselves weaklings, to show
themselves cravens, unable or fearful to per
form the tasks that providence has laid upon
us, but it would show that we had foully
abandoned the men in those islands who had
confided In our good faith. Xo, gentlemen, i
appeal to yon to re-elect President McKinley
because it has been given him to embody the
cause of national prosperity and the broad
doctrine that this American nation never goes
backward.
Earlier in the day Governor Roosevelt
made a three-minute talk at Wllmot from
the rear platform of the private car Min
nesota.
When the train arrived at Slsseton the
rain was falling fass and. an open-air
; meeting which had been /arranged for
was impossible. A stand was erected near
the. track and a crowd with umbrellas
had assembled to listen to the speakers.
j The Governor attempted to talk, but
1 his sympathy for his hearers, who were
, bravely standing in the rain, caused him
to desist. He entered a carriage and was
driven to the opera-house, whither the
crowd followed him, and there ho spoke
a few minutes.
This Is on the bdrder of the Sioux res
ervation and a large number of Indians
had come Into the little town to listen and
to see what was going on. On his return
to the train from the opera-house Gov
ernor Roosevelt observed a group of fifty
or more Indians standing on the street.
He Jumped out of the carriage and shook
hands with the members of the group to
: their evident delight and distributed a
: handful of McKinley buttons among the
1 crowd.
The train then started on Its return
journey to Milbank, where It arrived at
half-past 1 o'clock in the afternoon,- re
mained thirty minutes and proceeded to
Ortonville, Minn., where it arrived at 3
o'clock.
Here some more speech-making followed
in the rain. Governor Roosevelt In tho
course of his speech said:
You recollect four years ago the appeal that
was made through this country to one class
against another and the effort to array tho
West apainst the East, the workingman against
the capitalist and the farmer against the busi-

IN DELAWARE UNITE
COL.UMBUS. Ohio, Sept. 14.â The Ohio
Democrats opened their campaign here
to-day with a meeting in the afternoon at
Goodale Park and in the evening at tho
Goodale Auditorium. William J. Bryan
made speeches at both meetings and there
was a large attendance of Democratic
leaders from all parts of the Statf-.
Previous to the afternoon meeting Mr.
Bryan was tendered a. reception at the
Great Southern Hotel and he was es
corted to the park by a number of State
marching clubs.
Mr. Bryan spoke for one and a quarter
hours. His audience numbered many
thousands of people and they pave clnÂ«o
attention a3 well as frequent cheers. The
speech was a general review of the polit

false. You can't recollect all of them.. i!r.
Bryan prophesied asain and asain. at Minneap

noble band of reformers, Tammany Kali: and
at Indianapolis aealn ana again he said "K

Again. "If you vote for the g-old standard you
vote for four more year3 of hard times."
And again. "If you vote for the scold standard
the farmer will find th;it the priced oÂ£ his

Again, "If you vote for the gold standard"" th<Â»
wage worker will find that he stands idle more
and more."
Again. "If you votÂ» the Republican ticket
the business raefi will find that the number ot
failures will increase and the amount of bank
deposits will decrease."
Now I ask you not to take my word for it.
but to think of your own experience and com

IF the University of California can develop two strong guardst. a halfback and
a- fullback her football team for 1300 will be quite as strong; as the maprrifl
cent aggregation that crushed Stanford last year to the tune of 30 to 0. Only
five of last year's victorious eleven remain to begin the new seasonâ Captain
Pringle at right tackle; Zombie and Hill, ends; Cornish, center, and Smith,
halfback.
There still remain, however, brilliant men on the substitute list who Hst sea
son fought their way close up to the coveted positions. Clay, tackle, and Ker
foot. quarter, should slip into two of tho six vacant places. Men to take Hall's
position at halfback and Kaarsberg's at full are anxiously looked for. Mini,
Duden. Lipman. Gammon and More are aH small men. but have proved repeat
edly that they have the making of first class backs.
Possibly the freshman class may develop the rlgfht material for these Impor
tant vacancies. It has six men of known ability who may make the team over
the veteran substitutes of the upper classes. Whipple from Centerville. Sherman
of Belmont. Ramsaur from Occidental College. Fautz of Boone's. Starr of St.
Paul's School and Overall from Visalia are likely men who enter with good repu
tations.
But the most serious problem is that of placing Greisberg and Athern, last
year's pair of crack guards. Castlehun, who played sub-guard and tackle in '97,
is back and will make a bid for one of the places. Overall, who Is a candidate
for fullback, may be tried on the line. He weighs 200 pounds and should make a
formidable guard. Hendricks. a young giant In the sophomore class, will appear
for the first time also. It is possible that Clay may have to be moved from
tackle to guard and his place jriven to Hansen. Albertson or Stone.
Coach Kelly meets his colts for the first time on Monday afternoon. Nearly
100 men will appear on the field, one-naif of whom are freshman candidates.

TfJNFORAN ATHLETIC MEET
The match scheduled for to-morrow be
tween the Pacific and California Cricket
clubs has been called off, the Californias
not being able to get together a team on
account of the Illness of Arthur Dlckenson
and the absence of A, D. Reynolds and
W. II. Howard.
The tour of the city cricketers to Lake
County was ; a most agreeable and suc
cessful one. In their first match the San
Francisco men. tired and shaken up by
their long journey, made a poor display
of batting, being all out for &3 runs. The
Burns Valley men. with 27 from E. E
Cray and 15 not out from G. R. Webber
compiled 82 runs, winning the match by 29
runs. In a second Innings Burns Valley
scored 62 for the less of 4 wickets. The
next day. in the presence of many spec
tators, the match between San Francisco
County and Lakeport was played, the vis
itors winning easily, Lakeport compiling
only 35 runs, thus losing the third and
last match by 75. runs.

Although both Hammersmith and Carroll
are reputed to be the fastest swimmers
on the coast in the shcrt distance eventa
they have a number of competitors In and
out of- the Olympic Club who will be
ready to meet them when the champion
ships are to be decided.
Quite different of build are Hammer
smith and Carroll. The former is rather
short and of stocky frame, more on the
order of the tumbler than the swimmer.
Besides being: a swimmer he is the cham
pion diver of the Olympic Club. Many
medalg and prizes has he won for fancy
and plain diving-. By many of the active
members of the Olympic Club Hammer
smith is rated as the most prominent all
round athlete among: the Olympics. He
fences, boxes, wrestle?, tumbles, swims,
dives and works well on the t>ar and
trapeze.
Carroll has the ideal build of trie swim
mer and the boxer and he is an adept at
both. His muscles are not bulky, but
long and of sinewy texture. Hla best time
has been in the 100 and 220 distances, b'.it
latterly he has branched -out in longer
races. He will try the 410, in which he has
made very fast time.
Sydney Cavill, the champion swimmer
of the world and the instructor at the
Olympic Club, has taken Hammersmith
and Carroll in hand. He says they are
remarkable swimmers and are equal to
the best in their own distances.

SACRAMENTO. Sept. 14.â A card wilh
a weather-beaten look did not de.tract
from the attendance at the park this
afternoon, the grand stand and betting
ring again being crowded. The owner oÂ£
Eulah Me refused to meet The Roman in
the stake for? three- year-old trotters, ex
cept under certain conditions which were
not entertained, eo the latter colt enjoyed
a. walkover. '
On the opening day of "the meeting Za
loch was distanced in the first heat of
the green pace. To-dÂ«y he sold for a
postage stamp In the speculations on the
2:21 class pace and won like a good one.
There were only four starters. Fredericks
burg bringing $20. Hermia $11. while Cleon
and Zaloch were tossed In for $3 and $4.
The favorite, driven by Bunch, took the
first and then closed up shop. Lipson
had Zaloch tuned to concert pitch by this
time and the McKinney horse rattled oiT
three pleasing heats for the short-ender.s,
the first choice coming In second on each
occasion. In the first heat Fredericks
burg covered the mile in 2:12 flat. The
winner is a son of McKinney and Gazelle,
owned by J. M. Lipson of Col ton. Cal.,
and for a young horse Is a most promising
one.
Four running events were then decided,
of which number favorites captured two.
Starter Pat Reagan was in good form,
sending the fields off without noticeable
delay.
Canmore's Victory.
In a poorly conditioned six furlong 1
scramble for two-year-olds Cjnmore got
In with 105 pounds and ran away from
his company at odds of 1 to 3. George
Dewey led Screenwell Lake out for the
place.
Hafley may be a good exercise boy. but
he is no racerider. He made a bungling
job of it astride Lodestar, the favorite for
a six furlong selling run and plainly the
best racer In the bunch. Amasa broke
first, winning by four open lengths. Phle
gon finished second, but was overlooked.
Lodestar be'ng placed second and Al
moneer third.
The only real contest was that furnished
by Merry Boy and Bathos in the seven
furlong selling number. The former horst,
a 4 to o chance, overhauled Bathos In the
stretch, getting the decision hard-ridden
by a neck in 1:28. Loconomo held the
others safe getting show honors.
Charley Fink finally scratched out &
purse with Swiftwater. The ring laid 6
to 1 about her in thÂ« betting on the nual
scramble for maidens and she was spar
ingly backed. Shaking the bunch off at
th*Â« stretch turn Mounce landed her a
handy winner over Frank Woods and the
favorite. Trevathan.

The question of whether citizens of
Guam are Americans was raised In the
United States District Court here | to-doy.
Judge Estee expressed the opinion that
the native born people of Guam .aw
Americans by virtue of the annexation
of their country by the Lnited Â¦ States.
The question arose in connection with tr*
application for naturalization papers of
Revnold Reyes, a native of Guam ajia a
former -subject of Spain. He took out
papers, though the court said It was prob
ably unnecessary. There are f^**;"
other Guam men here and some tlllplnos
v,hose standing Is involved In the same
doubt as that of Reyes.
By the steamship Nippon Maru Hono
lulu received news that the Chines* who
had the plague on board the Coptic at
Kobe, Japan, was not one of the men who
tock passage here, as had been reported.
The news was very welcome as rÂ« I levins
the fears that another outbreak or tne

HONOLULU, Sept. 8.â A thrilling story
of insurrection and battle on Laysan Isl
and, a small speck in the Pacific which
was once a Hawaiian dependency, reach
ed here to-day by the bark Ceylon, which
brought to Honolulu all the participants
in the affair. It was a fight between Cap
tain Spencer, the "king of the island,"
and forty Japanese laborers who were
taken there to help load vessels from
Honolulu with guano. The captain fired
eight bullets into the crowd- of forty men,
killing two of them and wounding three
others. â¢
There were only five white men on the
island when the trouble took place. Ac
cording to the story of Captain Spencer,
the Japanese had a plan to seize the isl
and and kill all the whites. On the even-
Ing of August 11 they assembled in front
of his residence and there was a lengthy
discussion. It ended when the Japanese
made a rush to take the place. Captain
Spencer stood his" ground, with a six
shooter in each hand, and fired at the
leaders.
The ring-leader and one other man fell
dead and three other Japanese dropped to
the ground seriously wounded. The other
thirty-five fled.
Captain Spencer and the other whites
remained on guard all night and the next
day they began to round up the Japanese
and put them on board the Ceylon, to be
taken back to Honolulu. They were all
put below In the hold, with the hatches
fastened down, and the bark started away
from the Island, leaving behind only two
white men. Captain Spencer's son and the
carpenter employed by the guano com
pany.
Spencer Arrested.
On arriving in Honolulu last night Cap
tain Spencer was charged with murder
and he will be held for trial. The story
of the Japanese is very different from
that told by Spencer. They allege that
they made no attack upon the captain,
but simply assembled at his house to dis
cuss the matter of food supply. For sev
eral weeks they had been on short ra
tions, owing- to the wreck of the bark
McNear, which went ashore on Dowsett
reef while on her way to Laysan with
provisions. The Japanese say that the
shots wye fired into the, crowd without
provocation.
Captain Spencer's wife was with him on
the little island when the sensational
trouble occurred, and accompanied him
to this city on the Ceylon. The murder
charge was placed against him on the
strength of the statements of the thirty
five Japanese, and the case will be tried
in the United States District Court here.
Laysan Island is about 600 miles north
west of Honolulu. Some years ago it was
"annexed" to Hawaii by King Kalakaua
and since then it has been leased by a
Honolulu firm which sends vessels regu
larly for cargos of guano. It is a small,
low island, covered deeply with guano
and having on it no other valuable pro
duct. Here Captain Spencer and his wife
have lived for many years, alone among
the Japanese laborers and one or two
other whites 'that were there as foremen
or T helpers.'- Spencer's authority was su
preme on the little island, and for years
he has had the title among those who
know him of "king of Laysan Island."
Company Loses Heavily.
The Japanese who was the ringleader
in the trouble on the island was a new
arrival from Honolulu. Captain Spencer
declares that he went to Laysan with the
idea of working up a rebellion and placing
the Japs in control of the island.
The. schooner Aloha was on the way to
Laysan. Island from Honolulu when tho
Ceylon left and is supposed to be there
now. She was going in ballast to brln?
back a cargo of guano. Her master; Cap
tain Fry, expecting to find quite a colony
of workmen there, will find the little
island inhabited by only two men.
The Aloha will probably not be able to
get her cargo with the force she has.
as there is no docking at Laysan. and ves
sels have to stay two miles from shore
and have the cargo brought to them on
lighters. This will make the financial
cost of the fight very heavy. It has cost
a two months' trip for the bark Ceylon
and will probably also be the cause of a
similar uspless trip for the Aloha.
There will be a bitter legal right over
the tragedies of the fertilizer island. The
Japs are all ready to testify that they
were shot at without provocation and the
only white witness that has come to
Honolulu yet, ex-Policeman Splllner of
Honolulu/to a large extent corroborates
the story they tell. In addition to the
lturder case there is prospect of a. claim
by the Japanese on account of the treat
ment they received on the way back from
Laysan.
The local Japanese Consul. Miki Saito.
will' probably be asked to demand dam
ages for the Japanese from Laysan for
their sufferings on the way to Honolulu.
They were kept in the hold below amid
intense heat, during all -the twenty days
of the journey, as It was feared that there
might be more trouble on the vessel if
they were given liberty. Only one of
them was allowed on deck at a time. /
New Sewer System.
Honolulu's first sewer system, which it
was decided to build after the cholera
epidemic of 1895 had directed attention to
the fact that such a system was lacking.
Is nearlng completion and will be in use
within a month. It was begun in 1890
end will cost ovfr $250,000. The plans for
the system provide for a complete cover
ing of the city and carrying the refuse
out into deep water beyond the harbor.
Great difficulty has been encountered In
laying tho pipes, owing to the fact that
on every Ftreet the workmen encountered
bard coral and streams of water. At
fourteen feet below the surface the water
ran so quickly Into the trenches that
gasoline engines had to be kept running
day and night to keep the water' down to
a level that made work possible.
Colonel Ruhlen Honored.
Colonel George Ruhlen, U. S. A., who
has been quartermaster , in charge here
during all the heavy transport business
growing out of the war in the Philippines
and has now been ordered to Seattle.- has
been presented by the local merchants
with a handsome gold watch as a token of
their esteem. The colonel has looked af
ter over 200 transports passing through
on their, way to Manila during the past
eighteen months.
Hackman Murde'red.
Another murder was >added to the long
list of such crimes recently committed
in the Islands last Saturday, when a Chin
efe hackdriver was killed in his vehicle
on a lonely road near Hilo, island of
Hawaii. The murder was one of the
most brutal in the history of the Islands.
Some passengers In the hack cut the
driver's throat as he sat in front of them,
afterward throwing the body over a fence
and covering it up with brush. , .-. Â¦
The victim of - the crime . was Ah .Too.
a well-known Hilo hackman. He left Hilo
at about 10 o'clock . in the : evening: with
two white men in his hack. At 2 o'clock
next morninp his hack returned empty,
with the front seat drenched with blood,
the horse having found Its way back.
A search was Instituted by Ah Jac-'d
relatives, nnd .when daylight came ihey
hand his body where it had been thfown.

Why did not the San Francisco Exami
ner publish all of Mr. McKlnley's letter of
acceptance?' Why did it pretend In its
issue of yesterday to publish the letter in
full when In fact the most essential por
tion of it is suppressed? There is only
one of two reasons for Hea/st's cowardly
action. Either, the portion omitted was
designedly suppressed by him and the
Bryanlte committee in Chicago, on ac
count of the damage the truth of history
would do their cause, or that they as
sumed that the Bryan followers read
only Hearst papers. William R. Hearst
and his hirelings, "the longest leased
liars" in the world, arc a disgrace not
only to the honorable profession of jour
nalism, but they disgrace the honesty and
decency of the American people.
HACKED McKINLEY'S LETTER
CENSUS experts estimate that there are now in
the United States something like 3.000,000
young men who will next November have the
privilege of casting their first ballot in a Presidential*
election. In some closely contested States the new
voters will be numerous enough to turn the scale and
decide how the vote of the State shall be given. A
considerable number of them will follow their fathers
in politics, but it is safe to say a very large proportion
will study the issues of the time for themselves and
make their own choice of the party they will support
with their ballots. Such being the case, it is gratify
ing that Republican leaders are making earnest ef
forts to instruct young voters on the issues of the
time, the events that led up to them and the policies
of the opposing parties with respect to them.
The attention of young men is to be directed first
to the fact that the campaign of the Democratic party
this year is made largely upon false issues. The
fraudulent nature of the cry about ."imperialism" and
"militarism" should be explained, and the pretensions
of the Democrats to pose as supporters of the
Declaration of Independence .and of- the principles of
Lincoln exposed. It is to be pointed outthat the
true issue of the time is Bryanisni against .conserva
tive government. Bryanism means free silver, free
trade, national dishonor by a degradation of the cur
rency and industrial disaster by. the overthrow of
protection. On the other hand, the Republican paÂ»-ty
once more enters the national campaign as the cham
pion of those great principles of liberty and progress
that have brought us to the front rank of the greati
nations of the world; it enters the contest under the
leadership of William McKinley, one of the purest and
wisest of a long line of illustrious statesmen; it
wages unrelenting warfare against the party that has
declared for a policy of reactionâ that advocates prin
ciples that would demoralize* our industries and tar
nish our national honor. ". 'Â¦.
For the purpose of. enabling young voters to work
more effectively in the campaign there has been
formed an association known as "The First Voters'
Kepublican National League," and organizations arc
being effected in all pr,rts of. the country. A recent
circular from the national headquarters of the league
in Chicago says: "Each local league, when organ
ized, shall arrange. for regular meetings, appoint a
committee on membership,, whose .duty it shall be to
make a systematic canvass of the first voters, that the
league. may have upon its rolls the name of every Re
publican first voter in the community: elect a captain^
who shall lead the members as they march in parades
and attend meetings, and on election day see to it
that every man casts his vote. In addition to its own
work the league should be ready to give active assist-
THE ARMY OP NEW VOTERS,
/ â * IRCULARS have been issued announcing the
( programme of the eighth conference of the Na-'
tional Municipal League, which is to be held
in Milwaukee beginning September 19 and continuing
for three days. The work of the league has now be
â¢come highly influential throughout the Union, and
therefore even in the heat of a political campaign a
good deal of interest will attach to the proceedings of
the meeting.
Among the principal papers prepared for the occa
sion are: "The Essential dements in Good City
Govcrnment," by Charles J. Bonaparte of Baltimore;
"The Representation of Different City Interests in
the Council," by Hon. William Dudley Foulke of
Richmond, Ind.; "The Influence of Public Service
Companies on City Government," by Rev. Washing
ton Gladden, D. D., of Columbus, Ohio, who was re
cently elected an Alderman of that city; "The Gov
ernment of the City of Glasgow," by. Rev. Albert
Lazenby, recently of the city of Glasgow; ,"A Year's
Municipal Development," by Clinton Rogers Wood
ruff of Philadelphia; "The Model Charter, a Practical
Experiment of Long-tried Principles, Not an Inno
vation"; "The Model Charter and Wisconsin Cities,"
by Hon. Joshua Stark, president of the Wisconsin
Bar Association; ''Dees the Model Charter CtWer
Dangerous Powers on the Mayor?" by Charles Rich
ardson of. '-Philadelphia: "The Model Charter and
Small -Cities." by Professor S. E. Sparling of the
University of Wisconsin, who is also an Alderman of
Madison; "The Growth oi the Municipal Reform
Idea in the West," by Dr. Amos P. Wilder of Madi
son, Wis. . -
:Each of the papers is to be followed by a discus
sion, and as there is always a large attendance of men
who are eminent authorities in municipal matters, it
is assured the meeting on the whole will be one of
the most important the league has yet held.
The problem of good city government "has not yet
been satisfactorily settled in any city in j the United
States. . The various reform charters adopted during
the last few years have not produced the full measure
of benefits expected. Most of them, like that of- San
Francisco.; have .proven ' not much better than the
governments ' they superseded. By reason of that
fact the public interest in the discussions of the
league is, likely to increase for some time to come.
"Debate is tiresome at times, and municipal reformers
are generally long-winded talkers, but in the^end de
bate justifies itself- by bringing out some pood "plan
for grappling with th* evils of the time. The Muni
cipal League fills an important place in our politics)
and its .debates are among .those best calculated to
solve the complex difficulties of city government, and
/ccordingly : its proceedings "always 'merit' attentive

KNEW WHAT THET WERE ABOUT.
The money question, as McKinley has said, is "the
immediate question." It is the one that affects the
savings, the wages and the earnings of every citizen.
Other issues may be settled /later, but this must be
dealt with at once.
With Crokcr supporting the ice trust in the East,
Chairman Jones of the Democratic National Com
mittee supporting the round cotton bale trust in the
South and John J. Valentine supporting the express
trust in the West, it h not to be wondered that Bryan
has decided to let the trusts alone this year and do his
talking against imperialism.

AT Mechanics" Pavilion, last evening the Repub
lican campaign in this city was opened. The
orators who rddressed the meeting were
United States Senator Fairbanks and Hon. F E. Hol
loway. It was well worth while (or every citizen who
takes an intelligent and patriotic interest in the issues
of the time to hear these gentlemen. Each of them
holds high rank as an orator. and as a statesman.
Their discussions of the problems now before the
people were much more than ordinary stump
s-pecches. and, while their words were primarily ad
dressed to Republicans, there is no fair-minded man
who will not find interest and instruction in them.
It is gratifying that the Republican campaign has
Seen opened by orators of such eminence. There is
needed a thorough awakening of the lie publicans of
San Francisco to the duties of the time. Many Re
publicans have not yet registered. That primary duty
which political liberty imposes upon the citizen has
been thus far neglected by many men who pride them
t-tlves on being "good citizens," and who would be
the last to shirk or postpone any private responsi
bility. Numbers of n;cn who have prospered under
the administration of McKinley and who are aware,
how important to them is the continuance in undi
niinished vigor of the Republican policies respecting
finance and the tariff :<re yet seemingly indifferent to
the danger of the overthrow of all Republican legis
lation by the triumph of Bryan.
So many men of that kind exist in the Republican
j.arty that in Maine nnd Vermont the Republican
vote in the State elections this year was less than that
of four years ago, while the Democratic party shows
a considerable gain. The warning of those elections
"should not be overlooked. A slight decrease of the
Republican vote in Maine or in Vermont amounts
to nothing, but an equal percentage of decrease in
California would give the State to Bryan. In our
sanguine assurance of the election o.f McKinley we
i.iust not ignore the danger of overconfidence. The
only way to assure victory is to work for it.
There *-2s ample tirdor and onthusiasm displayed
:.l the meeting last evening. The audience was as
large as the vast auditorium could hold and not a
binjrle point made by the orators of the evening was
:!iissed by the appreciative listeners. The responsive
cheers which greeted every strongly stated argument.
even- patriotic appeal, every mention of the names of
McKinley and Koosevtlt. attested the zeal of the
â¢voters and manifested their devotion to the party of
sound money and protection. Such manifestations,
however, will not count on election day. The result
of the contest is to be cttermined not by cheering but
by voting. It is pertinent to ask at this juncture
vhcihcr all the men who applauded with enthusiasm
the speakers last evening have taken the trouble to
register: whether they are members of Republican
clubs and have prcpnrcd themselves to work effec
tively for the cause they believe to be that of national
and individual prosperity.
The Call is not doubtful of the result of the election,
any more than is Senator Ifanna. who. as chairman
of the Republican National Committee, has repeat
edly uttered a warning against overconfidence. It has
every 'reason to believe the indifference of the
rank and file to the work of the campaign will soon
pass a;vay. Increiore in renewing the warning The
Call 553S no other object than l6 hasten the popular
aivakpning and to rouse Republicans to the duty of
immediate registration. The campaign has now been
formally opened in, this city. a:i<] surely there will
now be no further del?y among the voters in getting
themselves rcgisterc-!. Why not attend to it to-day?

FOR THE CALL READERS.
for all who are in distress. 'Â¦ "*
With the news from Galveston and other storm
swept cities of Texas fresh in the minds of the people
it will jiot be necessary to emphasize the need of
making contributions promptly. The wounded, the
sick and the homeless cannot wait. Want and hun
ger and death are very near to many, and those grim
foes of humanity never wait for time or tide. Let
California act at once in this matter. Come forward
with your contributions. It is the voice of humanity
that calls, and the cail comes from a sister State when
25,000 homeless people are waiting for help.
PROMPTLY and liberally have the American
people lesponded to the appeals of the stricken
7 districts of Texas. From all parts of the Union
a bountiful stream of* contributions have poured in
ever since the first cry for help was heard. So large
have the donations been that the Governor of Texas
estimates that by to-night the total will exceed
$3,000,000. Among the communities that have been
most generous San Francisco holds a high rank, and
California has been among the foremost of the States.
The situation therefore begins to clear up, and along
the edge of the retreating clouds of horror is to be
seen the glow of charity like a rainbow overarching
the land.
Large, however, as, have been the gifts, the spon
taneous flow of help from a generous people must
not yet cease. The disaster at Galveston has been
one of those terrific calamities whose direful results
outstrip imagination and surpass the exaggeration of
statement they inspire. The later stories have not
diminished the first w:ld estimates of death and de
struction. On the contrary, the tale of loss grows
from day to day. It was first supposed the loss of
life would be about 2coo and the loss df property
would approach $10,000,000. Later calculations based
upon the examinations made since the storm increase
the number of deaths to 5000 'and the money loss to
$20,000,000. Such a calamity is bound to entail suf
fering for a long time 'to come, and the donations
thus far made will be but a small part of what will
be needed by the stricken people.
the first burs:: of sympathy excited by the
horror of the appalling story is over there will be less
indiscriminate giving, but, on the other hand, those
who give from principle and from reflection more
than from mere impulses will doubtless add much to
the contributions in all parts of the Union. For the
purpose of promoting such donations Governor Gage
has acted wisely in appointing a State relief commit
tee, made up of representative men whose interest in
all matters of public welfare is well known and who
thoroughly represent the sympathies of Californians

GENERAL JAMES SMITH THANKS THE CALL
FOR SUPPLYING THE SOLDIERS WITH PAPERS
J\ i/ A ANY times have the political managers of the
/ \ Southern Pacific Railroad affronted San
* Francisco by a display of brutality in domi
neering over their henchmen or of hypocrisy in seek
ing to deceive the public, but never in' all the history
of the road have its managers ever committed an act
in which brutality and hypocrisy were so mixed as in
the publication in the railroad organ on Thursday
afternoon of an editorial entitled "Kick Kelly Out."
There was no attempt at mild treatment in the a,r
tlcle. It was bluntly said: "The Republican leaders
should cast Martin Kelly out from among them."
Then it was added, in big black type: "He is inde
cent." "Kelly is an impostor," "Kelly is dishonest,"
"Kelly is a traitor," "Kelly is a menace," "Kelly is a
rascal."
Why should Herrin make this sudden and furious
attack upon Kelly? Two years ago the Republicans
of San Francisco "kicked Kelly out" and kicked
Crimmins and the rest of the gang along with him.
The "impostor" and * the rascal" was then out of poli
tics. Who brought him back? What power was it
that lifted him out of the gutter, gave him the means
of getting prestige in ward politics and reconstituted
him a boss?
Kelh's present prominence in politics is due solely
to the Southern Pacific Railroad and its attorney,
Herrin. Herrin and the corporation desired to gÂ»*t
control of the Republican party in this city. They
made use of Kelly and allied themselves with him for
that purpose. Kelly had never been anything but a
slum politician before Herrin took him up. He had
been content to do politics in back rooms and to keep
out of public sight, and he would never have had any
desire for publicity had not the Hon. W. C. Van Fleet
recognized him at the Santa Cruz convention as a
"leader" of the railroad forces. Van Fleet appointed
Kelly's committee on credentials and-stood sponsor
for Kelly's introduction to "open politics." Having
such a recognition and such an introduction from
Van Fleet, and feeling sure that he was worthy of his
new friends, is it surprising that Kelly should feel like
displaying his dignity? Is it strange that he should
wish to show himself in conventions, make speeches,
nominate candidates, escort them to the chair and dis
play all the importance given him by his alliance with
Herrin and by the favor of the Hon. W. C. Van
Fleet?
Herrin and the railroad have used Kelly for all he
is worth.- They have got his goods, and now they
wish to kick him out. Is that considered fair even
by railroad politicians? Who but Kelly devised the
schemes by which the railroad could encroach upon
the Republican party in this city? Who but Kelly
and fellows like hi:n brought out the toughs and
rounders that made the Republican primaries a dis
grace in order that Herrin might win? Who but
Kelly did the dirty, hard and rough work that the
railroad demanded? Who but Kelly furnished the,
brains that conceived cS well as the energy and impu
dence that executed the plans for carrying out the
railroad schemes?
Why should Herrin wish to kick Kelly out? Why
should the railroad organ call upon Republican lead
ers to do the job? Should the railroad managers get
control of the Legislature or of the Board of Super
visors there will be jobs galore and money will cir
culate. Is Kelly, who did all the work, to have none
of the spoils? There arc corporations such as the Spring'
Valley Company, the Market-street system, the tele
phone company and ethers which will have to make
contributions for the education of the Supervisors on
the subject of rates. Is Kelly to have nothfng to do
with the expenditure of the contributions? After
doing most of the fighting is Kelly to be kicked out
before the spoils are distributed?
\V. F. Herrin oi the Southern Pacific is the author
of Kelly"s power in politics at this time, and the Hon.
W. C. Van Fleet is sponsor for Kelly's appearance in
public. If the railroad wishes Kelly kicked out it
should first kick out Herrin.
KELLY fIND THE RAILROAD.
ance to the regular party organization. It is of the
greatest importance that the first voters throughout
the land should take up this work.; Such action on
their part will not only help to win 'a victory in the
present campaign, but it will do much to prevent a
renewal in the future of the attack that is now being
made upon the very foundations of republican govern
ment on this continent."
The work, of the league should be heartily taken
up and supported in California. As is well said in the
circular: "The young men of the country should feel
a peculiar interest in the results of this campaign.
If the seeds of folly are to be sown, it is they who
must reap the fruits. II this nation is to listen to evil
counsels and depart from the path of duty ami
/rogrcss that it has kept for over a hundred years,
if it is to adopt a policy of reaction, if it is to stoop
tc dishonor, if it is to pass into the throes of class
warfare, the baneful results will fall with greatest
weight not upon the present but uptm the genera
tions that are to come.'*

TAX LEVY WILL
BE RE-ENACTED
BY SUPERIORS
City Officials Decide to Fol
low State Law as a
Precaution.
At a conference of city officials yester
day it was decided to reaffirm the city tax
levy of $1,127, made last June, on the third
Monday in September, when the State
rate of .498 will be officially declared by
the board, thus making a total rate of
5L625. This course will j be taken as a
measure of precaution to avoid any ques
tion of the legality of the levy. The mat
ter of reapportionment of funds. fast be
coming exhausted will not be made. -
There were present at the conference
Mayor Phelan. his attorney. D. C. Mur
phy; Auditor Wells, his attorneys, Lloyd
& Woods; Supervisors Tobin and Jennings
of the Finance Committee, Supervisor
Connor and City Attorney Lane. The
meeting was Important, as Supervisor
McCarthy has raised the question of the
validity of the June levy, as the panhan
dle and other bonds, which have not yet
been issued, were included in that levy.
Mayor Phelan contended that there was
no conflict between the charter and the
State law, as the city had levied its tax
last June, but as the State's agent, the
board will levy the State tax on the third
Monday in September. He then sub
mitted a lengthy legal opinion prepared
by Attorney Murphy, in which It was
held that the charter nrovlsion on the
subject of taxation supersedes the gen
eral law, and that where the city and
county is concerned the fixing of the tax
rate is purely a municipal affair.
City Attorney Lane said that if the
same rate levied In June should be re
enacted on the third Monday in Septem
ber it would avoid any complication
raised bv taxpayers who might question
the validity of the June levy. There was
no legal necessity for It, but it would be
wise to do so.
Attorney Lloyd said he desired to as
sist the city In having a safe levy, and he
favored the re-enactment of the levy
adopted in June. He said that some one
! would attack the June levy, and the point
could be protected by reaffirming the levy.
He said that the levy of June need not
be amended or changed in one iota, but
that as a measure of precaution It should
be readoDted when the State rate was
levied next Monday.
Auditor Wells then asked what should
be done with the funds that are fast be
coming exhausted without another reap
portionment. He referred to the contracts
for hospital supplies which ajready great
ly exceed the appropriation, also the ap
propriation for the care of feeble-minded
children, which last year was $22,000 and
only $15,000 this year. It was the opinion,
however, that the reapportionment could
not be made. The Mayor explained that
steps were being taken to keep the ap
propriations within the one-twelfth
clause. The matter of printing and sta
tionery which â¢was ordered by the Board
of ' Public Works to be paid out of its
own funds was held to be illegal by Wells,
as there is a specific appropriation of $24,
000 for the purpose. The Mayor agreed
that such was the case, but attributed
what he was pleased to call a mistake to
the fact that the charter is not yet in
working order, and was necessarily slow
of operation. It was decided to pay the
demands in the irregular way, the Mayor
agreeing to share the responsibility.
There Will Be No Change in Rate
and No Reapportionment of
Funds Fast Becoming
Exhausted.

It must at once be conceded that artis
try 1* not to be found in Whittier's
poems. Even when he is most impres
sive and best worth readingâ and often
he is very Imprest ve indeed and extreme
ly well worth readingâ he wins his power
over us in no degree through a curlosa
felicitas of phrase or Imagery or versifi
cation. In the proem to his poems he
has noted, and justly noted, his lack of
"rounded art," and has contrasted his po
etry with what he calls In characteristi
cally conventional words "the old melod
ious lays" of such singers as Marvell and
Sidney and Spenser. IXmbtless. Whit
tier's verse is now and then finely vigor
ous and even musical, and' doubtless his
phrasing, particularly In some of his im
passioned moral poems. Is often vital and
Imaginative. But ho has in his work no
certainty of Instinct; he is never safe
against utter commonplaceness both of
sentiment and of phrase. Triteness of
diction, then obviousness of motif and a
happy-go-lucky styleâ these are the pre
vailing faults of Whittler's poetry.
Yet when these faults have been ad
mitted in their full proportion, and when,
too, all the cruder melodramatic stories
have been set asideâ the versified dime
novels like "Mogg Megone" and the Irre
deemably "plain tales" and legends lika
"The Bridal of Pennacook," and when
finally the tediously humdrum moralizing
has been expurgatedâ we still have a
goodly residuum of Whittier's poetry that
possesses enduring charm and power. .-'-Â¦-
Perhaps most noteworthy of all- the
poems are those that express moral in
dignation, that protest against oppression
and that plead for freedom. In treating
these themes Whittier's voice grows
clearer and more resonant, his verse Is
tenser, more vibrant, more subtly alive
to the changes of his moods, and his
words are picturesque, original, search
ingly sincere and impassioned. : A stanza
from "The Rendition" well represents the
mood in which many of these poems were
written:
And as I thought of Liberty
Marched handcuffed down the rwordefi street.
The solid earth beneath my feet
Heeled fluid as the sea.
It is not easy as we recall' Whittler's
portraitâ particularly the portraits of
later yearsâ to fancy behind the some
what pale, unexpresslve and withered
face a spirit fierce enough to flame out in
the words and stanzas of many of the
voices of freedom. But the pathetic
burning eyes tell the story. Underneath
the quakerish plainness of aspect there
was an unquenchable ardor of love for
mankind and hatred for wrong and op
pression. When Whittter heard or read
of some deed of cruelty or tyranny the
whole spirit of the man became a flame
fanned by the wind, and the true inter
pretation of his worn face In later years
would explain it as a face burned out and
calcined by the heat of moral indigna
tion.
TTT^?5*. a 3 equally essential Ingredient in
\v hittier s nature was a sweet and almost
homely delight In the common things ot
life. Nowhere more surely than In his
verse can those of us who have been chil
dren In country towns and villages flna
revived the old-time childish deli&hts in
summer and winter, in the fields. In the
woods, in birds and insects and all living
creatures whose ways were so delectably
droll and enticing. The indoor home life
with its placid, simple pleasuresâ"Whit
tier has captured that, too, and preserved
It with exquisite fidelity and charm. "In
treating themes like these he is a New
England Ce>wper, and yet he is closer to
fact that Cowper and has a racier, less
literary idiom. "Snow-Bound" transports
us in a moment into the magical winter
regions of boyhood; the poem makes one's
breath congeal in the air as one reads;
all the old winter feelings exhale from
the pages. In "Amy Wentworth" and
"Among the Hills" Whittier calls up with
delicate vividness the softer aspects of
rustic New England life; the stanzas
carry with them a delicious russet fra
grance. In these poems and manv others
Whittier excels In spiriting up before us
the very counterfeit presentment of New
England country landscapes â their

Idealization; there Is much happy close
ness to the many-hued and nicely varied
fact.
Of course, the poems that Whlttler is
oftenest remembered by are ballads like
"Maud Muller," "Barbara Frletchi**,"
"The Angels of Buena Vista," "Skipper
Ireson's Ride" and "The Pipes of Luck
now." Several of these have been droned
by reciters out of all semblance of fresh
ness and power; but even In themselves
they vary greatly in value. ".Maud Mul
ler" is at best little more than a maudlin
sentiment. "The Angels of Buena Vista"
Is a cleverly theatrical ballad, rather cheap
in tone and phrasing, and overlibcral of
melodramatic limelight situations. "Skip
per Ireson's Ride" is an admirably spir
ited narrative â a fine compound of nu
mor and pathos, human through and
through, and delightfully grotesque and
picturesque. "Barbara Frietchie" and
"The Pipes of Luckr.ow" portray gen
uinely dramatic incidents with terseness
and vigor of yhraae. sureness of music
and forthrightness of movement.
But the poems where Whlttier comes
nearest to creating a nameless kind of
novel beauty are the two little known
poems, "Howard at Atlanta" and the
Song of Slaves In the Desert" Both
deal with negro subjects; both are trem
ulously musical In their rhythm: both are
poignantly pathetic. The former poem
catches and suggests even more marvel
ously than St. Gaudens' memorial to Rob
ert Shaw the atmosphere of Badness and
strangeness In which, when one looks at
them in certain imaginative moods, ne
groes seem wrapt and Involvedâ their
tragic yearning toward the beautiful de
nied them. The "Slave Song" Is sunsr by
a caravan of captives lashed onward by
Moors through the desert." "Rubee" Is
their name for God, and the heartsick
refrain. "Where are we going, Rubee?"
is woven in and out of the poem with
plaintive Iteration. The flercÂ® lights. thÂ»
dead shadows and the blazing colors of
the desert pervade from first to last a
poem which is strange and mystical be
yond anything else Whittier wrote; and
as we follow the lamenting train of slaves
through the pathless wind-swept tracts of
sand toward the ever vanishing gray
horizon line their sorrowful progress
grows for us almost terribly symbolic of
humanity's wayfaring through the wastes
of time. These are perhaps the only
poems of Whittier that carry the reader
beyond the bounds of perfectly sane and
authentic moral emotion.
'Whittler's "Songs of Labor" are rather
fictitious affairs, sentimentally decorative
In style and treatment. His drover, shoe
maker, fisherman and other heroes come
perilously near resembling the cheaply
pretty lithographs with which country
folk adorn their parlors. These poÂ»ma can
hardly hold their own with Mr. Kipling's
fiercely faithful prose and verse lyrics of
toil and tollers. On the other hand, there
remains one group of poems in which
"Whittier Is almost at his best â poems in
which he utters with impassioned sincer
ity hl3 personal faith in God and in tho
ultimate triumph of every just cause. In
this group belonjr "Invocation." "My
Psalm and "My Triumph." Every one
knows well the tender, buoyant, almost
boyish courage of "My Psalm." the sweet
youthfulness of Its unstained and un
dimmed faith In early ideals. "Invoca
tion" Is specially noteworthy because
several of its stanzas, describing God's
spirit breathing through chaos, have a
visionariness and an imaginative scope
and an intensity and audacity of diction
that are with Whittier very unusual.
â¢ Through thy clear spaces. Lord, of old
Formless and void the .I-a<1 earth rolled:
Deaf to thy heaven's sweet music, blind
To the jfreat lights which o'er it shlned;
Xo sound, no ray, no warmth, no breathâ
A dumb despair, a wandering death.
To that dark, weltering horror cam*
Thy spirit, like a subtle flameâ
A breath of life electrical. ?.-?:'Â¦
Awakening and transforming all.
Till boat and thrilled !n every part
The pulses of a living heart.
Then knew their bounds the land and Â»eaj
Then smiled the bloom of mead and tre*!
From flower to moth, from beast to man.
The quick creatlv? impulse ran:
And earth, Â¦with life from the* renewed.
Was in thy holy eyesight good.
Finally. In "My Triumph." a poem much
later than "My Psalm," there sounds the
same note of fresh and Joyous confidence
as in the earlier 'poem. Its closing lln*9
are good Hne3 to leave ringing In one's
memory as one parts from Whittier: they
are essentially characteristic of his sim
ple, cheerful, tender-hearted manliness:
Parcel and part of ail.
I keep the festival.
Fore-reach the good to bet
And share the victory.
I feel the earth mov# sunward*
I Join the great march onward.
And take, by faith, while living-.
My freehold of thanksgiving.
SCHOOL BOARD
HEEDS ADVICE
OF THE MAYOR
His Honor Has a Talk With
Chairman Mark on Its
Classification. â¢*
The news that the Board of Education
had decided to relieve the overcrowded
condition of the city schools by opening
up new classes and assigning the neces
sary teachers thereto, published In The
Call yesterday, caused general rejoicingr
in the ranks of the pedagogues who have
been consolidated out of their positions.
Parents whose /children have hitherto
been denied the privilege of recelvlne an
education owing* to the high classification
inaugurated by the board were also cor
respondingly elated. Many were the con
jectures as to what had induced the board
to change front. w*^~
Chairman Mark denied that the board
had been forced by Superintendent of
Schools "Webster to provide accommoda
tions 'for all pupils, but It is nevertheless
true that several of the very recommen
dations made by Webster for additional
classes and teachers In certain schools
will be put into effect at next Wednes
day's meeting of the board, notably In the
Bernal Heights, Buena Vista and the
Haight schools, where two classes will be
opened.
It la quite possible, however, that a
higher power has induced the board to
listen to the appeals of parents for a
classification that will not exclude their
children from the schools. This Is no less
a personage than Mayor Phelan. who
said yesterday that he had had a talk
with Chairman Mark regarding classifi
cation. He had no conference with the
board as a whole and what was said in
that talk with Mark neither will tell. The
Mayor, though, has already stated that
sixty pupils in a class was too many for
one teacher to handle, and it is likely that
the board has come around to his way of
thinking.
That the board is considering the ad
visability of appointing additional teach
ers In other schools was made evident
yesterday by its inspection of twelve
schools in the Mission district which have
been reported by Superintendent "Webster
to be in absolute need of extra accommo
dations. These schools include the Co
lumbia, Horace Mann, Fairraount, Mar
shall; South End. Hawthorne, Agassiz.
Mission and others. "While Chairman
Mark would not admit that additional
teachers would be appointed in each
school, he intimated that the congestion
in many of them was as represented by
Webster,' and the staff would be Increased.
Superintendent "Webster blames the
board for installing manual training and
cooking plants in the department to the
detriment of other studies. Section 16fi6
says that Boards of Education may place
subjects in the course of study other than
those mentioned In section 1665, but must
not do so to their neglect. Webster calls
attention to the fact that citizens In the
Sunnyside district have agreed to donate
a piece of land if the board will erect a
schoolhouse to cost $2500. In the Buena
Vista School Miss Catlln, the principal, is
registering a large number of pupils for
whom thero are no accommodations.
Auditor "Wells has suggested that In
order to adjudicate the controversy be
tween the board and Superintendent Web
ster the latter Immediately rent an out
side room and appoint a teacher. When
the demands are presented "Wells will re
fuse to audit them and "Webster could
then mandamus him to do so. Webster,
however, says that he will not under any
circumstances pursue the course sug
gested by Wells. He has other plans, and
one may be his appointment of a teacher
who has never been elected by the board.

tion by Appointing More
Teachers Said to Be
the Result.

STANFORD GLEE CLUB ,
SELECTS THE SINGERS
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, Sept. 14. â The Mahony
| mj siery bailies thu local officers. They
, have nut even the usual "new clew."
! They do not know which way to start to
* unravel the QUektiOn of how and when
the younK San Francis-can came to hirf
titath.
The "woman in the case" theory evap
oraietf when a live James Mahony called
at :he Tracy postoffice aryi got the letter
which the officers thought was written to
the deceased.
The Idea that he was thrown from a
horse hasÂ« been abandoned, for not a stray
horse or any one who has seen one can
l>e found in the section.
It has been pretty well established, how
ever, that the body was placed on the
roadway between 5 and 7 a. m. Monday.
But one train passes over the line dur
ing that time and the trainmen declare no
one resembling Mahony got out with
them.
That Mahony was murdered is a reason
able conclusion^ but .ic was not seen in
Tracy with any one; In fact, not seen at
all for a certainty, ?o there is no start
ing point. What the Officer* are looking
for now is a motive, but thev freely con
fess that thpy are against a stone wall.
The most important intimation made to
day was by the District Attorney when he
declared that there should have been a
complete autopsy of the body in order to
try and establish from what direction the
wounds wt-re received ind for the possible
discovery of some which were overlook* d.
The idea that robbery actuated the mur
der Is not received with favor, as Mahony
was traveling in clothing suggestive of
anything: but financial standing. The
reasonable conclusion ;? that there is
some mystery back of his takirj? off and
the Impression Is growing 1 that it will
never he solved. Some think he may havo
been murdered by trÂ»rr:r>s. but even a
thug would have some object for assault.
Hf was not quarrelsome or a habitual
drinker, so it is unlikely that he stirred
up any enmities if he fell in with a
crowd.
The District Attorney said this morninjr:
It Is the rtrangpft case I ever encountered.
That it is a cas-e of murder I am satisfied, but
the officer* flre unable to find the sllKhtost
clew leading to the i>erpetrator. The country
furroundtr.K the scene of in* man's death Is
Meak, desolate ar.d open. I have been told
tliat there were Indications on the man's body
â¢Â¦howlnsr that he had received his injuries from
thp front. as= hi* shrÂ»u!der-b!ar!e was crushed
in. There was no autopsy hfld. however. I
think ha<1 one been held It might have thrown
*i-me llcht on the manner of death, whether
from a.'sault <t from accident. In falling from
a train Injuries on that part of the body would
not be probable, thouirh It might have occurred
tmm the chin belnir forced down upon the bone
mentioned. I mu?t admit we are at eea and
have bf yet been unable to advance any theory
which satisfactorily covers the strange case. "
The District Attorney said this evening
that the cart tracks approaching the body
had been accounted for. which is the prin
cipal development of the day. By some
officers It Is claimed that the case has
been unfortunate in being badly handled
at the outset. It was taken for granted
at Tracy that it was an accident and the
Coroner was notified and the body re
moved to this city without due Investiga
tion at the spot. Owing to the accident
Idea no autopsy was held, which should
have been the casÂ»e. to determine the na
ture and extent of the Injuries.
While Sheriff Siblev Ip working ener
getically on the case it Is understood that '.
he has not abandoned the idea that the
wounds were the result of an accident, j
but the belt and co!!:;r found near the
body remain to be accounted for. Sheriff!
Slbley has transferrel his Investigations |
to San F*rancisco. No'hing is known here
of the results of his first day's work
there.

This Is Deemed Necessary in Order

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PACIFIC GROVE, Sept. ll-Thia ses
sion of the California Methodist Episcopal
Conference promises to result in a gen
eral rearrangement of Methodist affairs
In California, according to the belief of.
those among its members who are said to
be closest to the Bishop. It is stated that
when Bishop Hamilton took control of the
diocese he was impressed with its un
wieldy size, considered In the light of
present methods of management, and haj
since been planning a way to rearrange
the work so as to meet the requirements
of, the rapidly increasing population. Be
ing keenly alive to the prosperity of Cali
fornia the new Bishop has unlimited faith
in the State's possibilities, and being else*
an enthusiastic churchman he does not
wish Methodism to be left behind in thi
general progress. One problem he has al
ready met and solved by the organization
of the Pacific Japanese Mission out of tho
old Japanese district of this conference,
virtually a conference of itself though a$
yet to be under the jurisdiction of the
California Conference. It is said that
other similar problems are to be solved
by the creation of two new districts,
probably a division of the Napa, Oakland
or Sacramento districts, each of which is
over large for the supervision of one man.
This, of course, will, if done, necessitate
two more presiding elders, but the ses
sion is yet so young that there Is littie
I gossip rife upon the subject of possibi!
; ities for the appointments. The ministers
are greatly amused over the stories tr.at
have been circulated regarding the resig
nation of Drs. Case and Kirby, presiding
elders respectively of the San Francisco
and Oakland districts. As for Dr. Klrby
he" has not resigned, but his time has ex
piredâthe time limit being still in force
as regards presiding eldersâ and he must
of necessity give up his present ottlce.
There is no question but that Dr. case
will be reappolnted to the San Francisco
district for another year.
To-day's, work of the conference was
begun at 9 a. m., Bishop Hamilton pre
siding, and the first important business
after reading the minutes was reading a
communication from the treasurer of the
episcopal fund of the Methodist Episcopal
church, announcing that this conference
has fallen short in its last year's ap
portionment about $300: On motion of Dr.
Beard it was decided to instruct the pre
siding elders to enforce collection of
money for the episcopal fund as a pro
rata claim upon pastors.
Dr. E. S. Chapman of Oakland was then
Introduced to the conference and -ad
dressed the body upon the work of the
Anti-Saloon League of California, making
a vigorous and impassioned appeal to the j
members of the conference to carry the i
matter forward to a successful issue at I
the coming elections, and as a means of*
doing this suggested that they work for |
the election of non-liquor Supervisors in !
their respective counties. Dr. Dearborn i
of Colorado was also presented to thu Â¦
conference, but made no remarks.
The body then went into executive ses
sion to examine candidates for admission â¢
to conference and candidates for deacon's
and elder's orders.
METHODIST LAYMEN MEET.
Election of Officers and Reading of
Interesting Papers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PACIFIC GROVE, Sept. 14.â The thlr
teenth annual convention of the Laymen's
Association of the California Conference
met here to-day with probably the largest
number of delegates present ever known
in the history of the organization. The
body was called to order by President C.
C. Lombard of Oakland at 9:30 a. m. anil
the morning session was occupied chiefly
with the business of the organization, th?
president's annual address and the elec
tion of officers for the ensuing year. The
latter are:
President â I. J. Truman of San Francisco.
First vice presidentâ W. F. Cronemlller of
Sacramento.
Second vice presidentâ Miss Mary Dickson of
San Jbse.
Third vice president â Miss M. A. Thompson
of Oakland.
RÂ«cor<1li)K secretaryâ Professor , Rockwell V.
Hunt, University of the Pacific.
Corresponding secretary â Â¦Â£Â».' L. I>ennett of
Modesto. â¢ .
Treasurer â F. L. Turoln of San Francisco. .
The new officers assumed their respect
ive duties at the afternoon session and
an interesting programme was presented
Notable among the addresses was that of
Bishop Hamilton. his subject being
"Equal Representation Involves Equal
Responsibility."
Rolla V. Watt of San Francisco pre
sented a paper on the Methodist publish
ing interests of the Pacific Coast, which
was of especial interest and importance I
in the present state of the Book Concern ]
affairs. Mr. Watt is chairman of the i
commission created at the recent General |
Conference to take charge of the publish
ing Interests of the church on the Pacific
Coast.
To-night's session was notable for three
addresses, "Methodism In the Twentieth
Century," by T. B. Hutchinson of Napa:
"Our Superannuates." by .Rev. George
Clifford of Watsonville, and "Measures
and Margins of the Twentieth Century |
Movement." by Dr. S. D. Hutsinpiller of ,
San Francisco. At the close of the latter !
address the body adjourned for the pres- I
ent year. '. |
Special Dispatch to The Call
STOCKTON, Sept. 14.â "Wantedâ
Three patriotic and ambitious Demo
crats willing to carry the party col
ors in the legislative fight in San
Joaquin County."
If a sign reading thus was tacked on the
outside of the County Democratic Central
Committee rooms here it would appro
priately express the needs of the local
Democracy at this juncture of the cam
paign. Ever since the late convention
shelved I-angford, "the father of the Sen
ate," ill-luck has followed the legislative
ticket.
In the first place Joseph Peters regular
ly received the nomination for Asembly
man from the city district, but a few
minutes later the convention rescinded its
action and selected W. E. Johnson. A
day aftor the convention adjourned John
son declined the honor, creating a va
cancy for the committee to fill.
Fred Kincald had been nominated for
Assemblyman from the outside district,
but he pays he is too busy to consider
i politics, and intimates that because he
, was once a Populist that is no sign that
he is a Democrat now.
The final dash of cold water came to
day when II. E. Welch of Lodl, "the com
ing tall sycamore of the Senate," sent his
regrets to the committee and, for "busi
ness reasons," declined to try and suc
ceed Benjamin Langford.
So when the committee meets to-mor
row it will have to resolve itself into a
convention. There has been a scurrying
and a hurrying all day to try and find
self-sacrificing Democrats willing to ac
cept the second-hand honors, but the
dearth of candidates was the principal
discovery made by the searching party.
The committee meeting to-morrow prom
ises to be a warm one, as two factions
propose to lay to over the secretaryship.
The cry of the best element is "Throw
'the bosses out," and It looks as though
there would be a throwing match.
MUDDLE IN . ARIZONA.
Democrats Break a Deadlock by Hold-
ing Two Conventions.
Special Plsratch to The Call.
PHOENIX. Ariz.. Sept. 14.â The two fac
tions At the Democratic party to-day each
nominated a candidate for delegate to
Congress and each adopted a platftrm.
Each will file its candidate's name with
the Secretary of State, and the faction
that is rejected by him will appeal to the
court?.
That is the way in which the deadlock
that has existed for three days in the Ter
ritorial Democratic Convention was
broken this afternoon.
It became apparent to the supporters of
both J F. Wilson, present delegate, and
Marcus A. Smith, a former delegate, that
neither could be elected, if nominated, on
account of dissatisfaction. Both deter
mined a third 1. an should not be chosen,
and fo waged the war to a linsh. Since
the first attempt at organization and the
interference of the Sheriff the convention
has been controlled by two temporary
chairmanuone representing each faction
and acting bitterly, but seeking common
ground. By final agreement both factions
meeting In the same building made their
temporary organizations permanent and
each selected 'ts candidate. Two Central
committees were chosen and two plat
forms adopted. Both tickets will be tiled
with Territorial Secretary Akers as the
regular nominee, to be placed on official
ballot. One will be rejected and the other
faction will then carry the matter into
court for final decision.
The feeling has been intense and it was
seen by the managers that no progress
could be made by further deliberation. I
It is charged that bribery was attempted
in the convention, as well as in the Mari
copa County Convention, and these state
ments may be aired if the matter reaches
the courts.
PABTIAL FUSION IN IDAHO.
Democrats and Populists Agree on
Three Moot Points.
BOISE, Idaho, Sept. 14.â The Democrats
and Populists have effected a partial fu-
Eion. To-day the Democratic committee
filed its ticket. It also filed resignations
of the candidates for Congress, Auditor
and Mine Inspector, and the nominations
of the Populist candidates for those places
to Jill the vacancies. These are three
places offered the Populists at the time
of the State convention. The Secretary of
Stat* filed the ticket and took the- resig
nations and nominations under advise
ment for twenty- four hours. .
The three Populists put on are T..L.
Glenn of Bear Lake County for Congress,
E. VV. Jonee of Boise County for Auditor
and M. H. Jacobs for Mine Inspector. It
is admitted that three of the Populist can
didates have refused to withdraw. They
are C. M. Mullen for Presidential elector.
M. i._ Eby for Secretary of State and
Texas Angel for Supreme Judge. The
Democrats claim all the other Populists
have resigned, but no Populist papers
have yet been offered for filing.
All Resigned.

CA.USE.
Bursting of a ten-gallon keg of steam beer.
That is the summary of what happened to a party of Marin clambakors
on the way for a day's outing. Grant and Evans and Roberts had planned a
convivial little stag party to be held by the shores that fringe the "boundlnj?
deep near, where Point Reyes boklly thrusts its rugged crest into the blue
Pacific. The mien procured n spriner wagon and a team of hordes. They
loaded the vehicle to the puards with rations, dry and moist. Carefully
bolstered up In the center of the wagon was a ten-gallon keg of plain steam
beer, packed around which were the tear.!?, bacon, flour and other acces
sories of a well-appointed commissary department. There was not enough
rocjm on the front seat for the three, and so CharleR Evans enthroned him
s=clf, like King Gambrinus, upon the head of the big barrel, with all the
consciousness of a man who is "holding down a good thing." So they start
ed, and the three men indulged in discussing the splendid time they would
have. They recked not of the storm that was fomenting in the barrel.
They were within a mile of the clambake site. The waters of the sea,
blue as the sky above, flashed in the sunlight. Evans, Joyous to the heart's
core, began to trill that famous old d rinking song:
"Here's the gr>?A old beer,
"Drink her dawn!"
"Drink her down!
As his voice rose in a jubilant note at the end of the third line some
thing happened. There was a roar as of a thirteen-inch gun. Evans rose
high in the air as if shot from a catapult, propelled apparently by a great
white, creamy, frothing, cooling fountain of beer, on the crest of which he
appeared to ride with uncomfortable dignity. The steam beer had got Into
action. It burst its steel-hooped sides and the fragments of staves were hurled
about as shrapnel. The bung, like a shot from a pompon, struck Roberts on
the head and knocked him off the wagon seat. A shower of fragmentary
staves struck Grant, but he retained his seat. The brightened horses bolted
and at a turn in the road the animals fell and the vehicle upset. Grant's
arm was broken in the fall. One of the horses had broken one of its legs
and had to be shot. And there amid the ruins of their outfit and their
provender, with broken limbs and bruised bodies sat the trio and mourned.
It was some time after the accident before the men received medical aid.
Time will heal their cuts and knit their bones, but, as Mr. Evans remarked,
"It will be a long time before I can see in a barrel of beer anything but a
powder-mill in disguise."
It is believed that the explosion was caused by the continued shaking of
the barrel while being driven over the rough road.

SPEAK IN SAN FRANCISCO
5ENATOR A. J. BEVKRIDGE of In

ber 4. It will be his only speech in
California, and Colonel Stone and Senator
Cutter of the State Central Committee are
planning to make the occasion one of the
greatest rallies of the campaign.
Senator Beveridge is coming West under
the auspices of the" Republican National
Committee. He will make but one speech
in each State visited on this side of the
continent. From here he will go to Port
land and then to Seattle. . â¢
The reputation won by Indiana's ; junior
Senator as a brilliant orator will Insure a
tremendous audience for him at the Pa
vilion. He is the youngest member of the
Senate, but has won national recognition
as an able debater and an eloquent speak
er. His speech on the Philippine ques
tion, delivered after having studied . the
situation first hand in the islands them
selves, was one of the great efforts of the
session.
Senator Beveridge Is 3S years old. He
was born on a farm and worked his way
through Pe Pauw University, at .'Green
castle, Ind., and In his senior year won
.the Interstate cratorlcal contest, against
competitors from ten of the Middle West
States. .After a year spent, on the plains
to recover his health he began the prac

THE crcsing: of the Republican
campaign in California, which
historical event took place at
Mechanics' Pavilion last night,
was distinguished by Eeveral re
markable conditions, these being
the more than usually high char
r.cier of the audience In point of Intelli
gence, the due}? Interest manifested, the
re&dy appreciation of the force of the ar
>jruments put forward by the speakers and,
; bove all and beyond all else, the sterling:
I .ttriotism that In all places and at all
times has beÂ«>n the salient characteristic
Ot the Republican party.
Tha announcement that Senator Charles
Warren Fairbanks of Indiana would be
the principal speaker of the evening drew
a Ikj-ger crowd to the Pavilion than had
been expected by the managers of the
aff&lr. It took up all the sealing room, so
that when the Bear Club entered amid a
blaze of enthusiasm following- the band
playlag "A. Hot Time" it was impossible
to provide seats fcr them, bo they
marched out again and filtered back
wherever they could find a crevice in the
crowd.
On and about the platform were
prouped men prominent in the councils
<>f the party in this State, among: them
being- Congressmen Loud and Kahn, Sen-
Jitor Perkins. Cutter of Yuba, Reuben II.

Future of the Philippines.
Let iif briefly E'.e how utterly baseless and
foolish is the claim of Imperialism.
By the treaty of Paris Spain relinquished her
title and sovereignty to Cuba. The Island it
in prs.-essicn of the United States, which is
engaged i\ establishing lor It a republican
form of povernment. When this exalted task
is accomplished the people will have their in
dependence, ar.d the pledge we have made by
the declaration of v.-ar will have been faithfully
kept. There can be no fucgestion of Imperial
ism h*TÂ«?. Th<" very contrary is true, for at
this mr-ment we are building upon the ruins
of imi^riaMsm the fabric of Independent re
publican government.
WÂ« acquired title to Porto Rico by tha tenni
of the treaty of Parts. The people of the Island
welcomed our coming and have cordially co
Â«perate,d with us in our effort to establish a
liberal measure of government. Within two
years frim the ratification of the treaty tho
Porto Rlcans have been given a better govern
ment and have beea permitted to share In It
more fully thaji ever in their history. Xo ether
territory acquired hy the I'nited Ptates has
been given so large a measure of self-govern
ment # so quickly after acquisition. We have
given* them a more liboral government than is
enjoyed by th*> people of Alaska to-day, or
than was fr.joyed by the people embraced In
the Louisiana r.urrVase for many years after
the cesFirn of the territory by Napoleon.
We rnu?t now look to the Philippines to find
*cuÂ» evidence of a purpose to subvert the re
public. Spain was la poss^ssion of the archi
ppiogo for centuries before the battle of Manila.
Insurrections hnd occurred from time to time,
but fy.ner "r later ?fce asserted her authority.
The iayt Insurrection prior to the Paris treaty
resulted In a 5ettlÂ»-ment with the Insurgent
leaders, whereby Spain promised certain re
forms and agreed to ray $^00,000, $4W.<KK) of
which was paid In c.iyh and the residue was
unpaid at th* dat<Â» of our victory over the
Pl>Â«r.!sh fleet. Ae-Jir.a!<1o ar.d his coadjutors
hnd left th? island and had no thought of in
dependence. They had abandoned the contest
for concession? and weri in possession of a
lsrfrf> tribute levierj up^n the Spanish crown.
It is perfectly manifest that there was no sug-
Kertlon of Philippine independence when Dewey
entered Manila harbrr. and that Spain was
the nn!y sovereifrrty rfosnlzed by all nations
as rightly in possession of the archipelago and
authorized to apeak for the Inhabitants.
Philippine Republic a Myth.
We hrive heard much of a Philippine repub
lic. The truth iÂ» that no such republic, accord
in? to our understanding of the term, has ever
t.een established, cr is in existence to-day. It
\f true that aft?r we overthrew the Spanish
authority Afruinaldo undertook to establish a
government which he was pleased to Ptyle a
republic. u was. howpver. an Agulnaldoan
dictatorship. It was In nonsense created by
the people- Even all sembiance of the R-overn
rr."nt which he attempted to establish after the
Spanish overthrow has entirely vanished, and
his for.^s are broken into bands who are vainly
endeavoring to elude capture, hoping for the
Fuccess of the opposition ticket in the present
election.
The course of the administration with respect
to the Philippines is known to the world. It
has hc;-n dictated by the most exalted motives,
by a sense Â«;f simple duty. From the memor
able victory of Df-wey, no act has txen done
inconsistent with our obligations or In contra
vention of our national honor. When we over
threw the FpHjiirh authority, when w<Â» broke
down the only fivernirscnt in the .Philippines,
it became our duty to stay, not to" run away.
It became our duty to protect life and
property and to establish a stable government.
We did not enter the Philippines with the
rplrit of a eonqu'-i-ir W of a nation brnt upon
rnrro conquest, but instinct with tho spirit of
mercy, upon a mission of humanity: not for the
purpose, of ere.-tirg an empire, but for the pur
Â»ifs of overthrowing an empire.
Personnel of the Commission.
The President, has from the beginning given
the Philippine po*.p]e. the amplest assurance of
our generous purpose, and has sought to win
them to the ways of peace, prosperity and self
government. He has been desirous of substi
tutir.g civil for military authority, and has In
vite*, the people to the very largest possible
participation in their local admlnmtrution.
At an early date he Â«fnt a commission of
eminent, capable citizens to undertake to bring
thÂ» Filipino* into co-operation with the au
thorities of the LÂ»nited Ftates in the estab
lishment of peace find the promotion of civil
government among them. The commission had
the undoubted confidence of the American peo
ple. What better men for the task than Pro
fessor Hchurmon of Cornell University Pro
fessor Worcester of Michigan University. Gen
eral I>enby. ex-Minister to China; Admiral
L>ewey end General Otis.
Aguinaldo Was Encouraged.
Aguinaldo. greatly encouraged by the appar
ent division of sentiment In the XTnlted States
and the 'antl-lmperialistlc opposition to the
humane polity p.nd efforts cf the President
continued to resist the authority of tho United
States, the only rightful sovereignty In the
archipelago. Notwithstanding hi* rebellious
course, the work of instituting municipal gov
ernment and providing for the welfare of the
people In the different Islands has proceeded
with o>n*ldenib!e success, so that more Fil
ipinos are participating In their own civic ad
ministration than at any time in their previous
history.
We did not obtain the Philippines because of
their commerce or because of their proximity
to 'he Oriental countries with which the ad
ministration has been successfully establish
ing a great and expanding commerce, but we
acquired them because a national duty com
manded. And when duty orders, no nation dc
riring Its own ar.d the world's approval dare
di3Ot*y. Our course In the Philippines Im
perialistic! Whoever so affirms misjudges the
history of his time. No one can look upon the
efforts of the President to uphold our authority
and Integrity in the archipelago and do other
wise than praise. He stands for the American
people. His success Is their glory, his failure
their shame. He is not acting as a partisan,
but as a President. He is acting for the en
tire people, not with Imperialistic Intent, but
for the purpose of assertlnjr ths national au
thority, a duty which the ratification of. the
treaty of peace Imposed upon him.
Imperialism.
The present market ratio of silver and grold is
about 14 to 1. It is impossible to secure thÂ«
concurrent circulation of both metals if they
are to be coined ex a ratio which so disregards
the ratio in the markets. It \r an old law, rec
ognized .by financiers for unnumbered years,
that th3 poorest money Invariably drives out
of circulation the best. We are able to keep
a limited quantity of silver and paper in cir
culation at a parity with pr.Id if we declare
our purpose and have the ability to maintain
them at parity with gold by making them in
terchangeable with each other, or by some pro
vision restricting their use.
Mr. Bryan"s coinage policy Is opposed to thÂ«
policy of Thomas Jefferson and Alexander
Hamilton, who, in 1702, provided for the coin
age of silver and gr.id at their market ratio,
which was 1Z to 1. It is opposed to the policy
adopted during the administration of Andrew
Jackfon, when the ratio of 16 to 1 first ap
peared in our coinage laws. Was thiÂ» ratio
adapted amfdft the hysterical enthusiasm of
a political convention? On the contrary. It was
adopted after r^'nstaJcir.cr care, after the ratio
of t-ilver and geld had been ascertained in the
market. Â¦
La vrof the Bates.
The present Congress enacted a law establish
ing flrmly the gold standard. Every dollar of

ter money to-day than ever, and we will never
consent to Its debasement. We will never con
sent to silver monometallism which would
drive out even' dollar of gold and reduce the
silver and silver certificates, the greenbacks

Senator Fairbanks Dissects the
Fallacious Issues Put Forth
by Bryan and His Composite

essentially a creation of the Democratic poli
ticians of the Empire State, who are Mr. Bry
an's most enthusiastic and potential support
ers.
The Republican party is credited with thÂ«
only national' legislation which has been ef
fective in the regulation or restriction of com
binations in any degree. It enacted the Inter
state commerce law and the Sherman anti-trust
lawâ two measures which have been wholesome
in their effect. The complex relations of Federal
ami State authority have made It more or less
difficult to deal with the subject. Many of the
trusts are local within the respective States
and beyonfl the Jurisdiction of Congress.

in time for consideration prior to adjournment.
When In power the Democratic party accom

Congress did nothing In restraint of the trusts,
although the subject was then engaging public
The Republican party proposes to <JeaI with

LOWER PASSENGER RATES
FOR INVALID SOLDIERS
Uncle Sam's Disabled Will Be Car
ried to Missouri River at Re
duced Fare.
The Southern Pacific Railroad Company
and the other companies between this
city and the Missouri River have arranged
to give the invalid soldier, discharged
from Government service, the benefit of
an exceptionally low rate, commencing
yesterday.
The rate will affect only those soldiers
who have seen service In China or the
Philippines and who have been honorably
discharged here. They must have a cer
tified letter from the surgeon that they
are invalids.
The special rate will carry them as far
as thf Missouri River for $25. The usual
soldier rate 13 $37 50. There have been
quite a few cases where unfortunate sol
diers were anxious to get to their home
in the East, but had not enough money
to cfirry them. The new rate. It Is
thought, will enable all to get home, be
sides leaving them enough mogey to buy
food, etc.

pines during this process of ei-olutlon? ThÂ«
opposition propose that we should alienate our
title; that .we should deliberately surrender
our ownership to people confessedly Incapable
cf self-government, and establish a protector
ate. No more unwise and insane step U con
ceivable.
If we have no right to govern the Filipinos,
by what right shall we establish, a protectorate?
Who has invited us to establish a protectorate?
A protectorate under the circumstances Is of
fensive to the right of absolute Independence.
It is repugnant to the principles of absolute
self-government- It is a restraint upon the
freedom of the state.
For how long a period should the protector
ate be established? According to Mr. Bryan,
It !s to be perpetual. It should not be forgot
ten that the United States would be obligated
to stand ready with a navy and army neces
rary to profit the Filipinos forever In their
occupancy of the islands. If they are to be
given the absolute poss-t*ston of the islands,
to administer them according to their own In
adequate conceptions of government, there la
a moral certainty that they would become In
volved in trouble with, their neighbors and we
would be constantly menaced. But if we as
sert our authority and gradually educate them
to a full measure of participation In govern
ment, we will avoid the vexatious complica
tions which would naturally and Inevitably
arise If a protectorate were established, as
proposed by Mr. Bryan.
Lawton's Prophetic Words.
The opposition to the administration In Its
effort to uphold our rightful sovereignty In the
Philippines has made more difficult the task.
Abundant evidence comes to us to the effect
that divided sentiment In the United States has
cost many lives of American soldiers. The sad,
prophetic words of the intrepid Lawton should
be a warning to those whose opposition to our
own 'army may give encouragement to the
enemy. "If I am shot," said General Lawton,
"by a Filipino bullet. It might as well come
from cr.<! of my own menj becanse I know from
captured prisoners that continuance of fighting
is chiefly due to reports that are sent out frum
America." The past is beyona recall. Let us
hope that in the future the brave boys at the
front may be supported by a united sentiment
and that their arduous duties may not be made
more difficult and dangerous by divided coun
sels at home. â¢
Situation in Porto Rico. .
The Kansas City platform condemns the Porto
RIcan act. Thla measure, which for a time
gave rise to a difference of opinion among
many well-meaning citizens. Is constitutional
and just. The feature of the measure to>*which
most exception has been taken Is that wnich
provides for the retention of duties upon com
merce between Porto Rico ana the United
States. It has been charged that these duties
are in contravention of the constitution, aa dis
criminating against the I-ono nicans.
When we expelled the Spanish armies and
took possession of the island, we found 80O,Â«v)
people In a deplorable condition. Commerce
was paralyzed. There was much poverty anrS
much need of public Improvements. The hunsry
were fed, suffering was relieved, the Judicial
administration was Improved, Jails were
emptied of hundreds of prisoners unjustly held
and the people were Invited to share in as full
measure as possible In municipal and insular
administration. Schools were started, highways
were Improved and the work of uplifting the
people was begun and has been pushed to the
present hour. There was no scientific system
of taxation In the island. It was deemed wlsÂ°
by Congress that the people of Porto Kico
Fhould bear rart of the expense of the admin-"
istration of their own government, rather than
that the entire burden should rest upon the
United States. Fifteen per cent of the duties
Imposed by the Dlngley law were retained upon
all commerce between the Island and ports of
the United States, the enure revenue being
held for the benefit of the Porto Rlcans. It
was providrd that these duties should not be
continued after January 1, 1902, and should be
abolished at an earlier date If the new gov
ernment established shall have provided .the
requisite machinery for raising Its own reve
nue. By direction of the President the Span
ish export duties were abolished and food prod
ucts and agricultural Implements were admitted
without duty.
Anti-Trust Laws Unacted.
The Republican party recognises the hones-;
co-operation of capital to meet new business
conditions and to promote the extension of our
forelcn trade. It Is Inexorably opposed, how
ever, to all combinations or so-called trusts
intended to stifle fair competition, to create
monopolies or to control prices.
It has been said that the tariffs foster
"trusts." But we find that they exist In free
trade as well as In protected countries. They
ar* found In England, where they have existed
for many years. Furthermore, trusts exist. In
this country In articles and commodities which
are upon the free list as In those which are
protected. The most conspicuous Is the Stand
ard Oil trust. Another notable Instance Is the
ice trust in New York. Neither of theoe trusts
has been fostered by the tariff. The latter Is
Spain. It is consistent with our Institutions;
It Is the spirit of liberty, not of bondage. It
is not the language of Imperialism, but It Is
the utterance of republicanism. It means that
under our guidance these people are to be lifted
to a higher level of civilization and to the
enjoyment of free government, which to them
ban been hitherto unknown. The opposition
will find little In this policy, so admirably ad
vanced by the President, upon which to found
their claim of Imperialism, with which to
frighten the American people Into a forgetful
nesÂ« of the important economic and domestlo
problems which are placed In peril at heme.
There Is nothing In this policy Inimical to
the r<-nub!ic or in contravention of its splendid
traditions.
Bryan Supported the Treaty.
If the possession of the Philippines is Imper
ialistic Mr. Bryan's Insistence upon the ratifi
cation of the treaty was unwise. and Indefens
ible. What think you of a statesman who
would advocate the ratification of a treaty
which is Inimical to the republic and which
lays strong and firm the foundation of an em-
What should be our attitude toward the Fill-
ptre? If Mr. Bryan Is right now his potential
support of the ratification of the treaty was
a stupendous blunder. If, however, he was
right then, his present attitude with reference
to the result of the ratification is utterly in
excusable.-
The question arises, why did Mr, Bryan sup
port the ratification of the treaty? It was
ratified by only one majority. With his oppo
sition It would have been easily defeated. Was
there any danger to the republic In the ratifi
cation? If so, was It not his duty to have op
posed It to the utmost? "When the war was
over," said he in his Indianapolis speech,
"and the Republican leaders began to suggest
the propriety of a colonial policy, opposition at
once manifested itself. When the President
finally laid before the Senate a treaty which
recognized the Independence of Cuba, but pro
vided for the cession of the Philippine islands
to the United States, the menace or Imperialism
became bo apparent that many preferred to
reject the treaty and risk the Ills that might
"follow." â¢ . .
Did not Mr. Bryan see the lurking dangers of
Imperialism which were so manifest to others?
Did he sympathize, with their preference to re
ject the treaty? Let him answer for himself.
"I was amon; those who believed." said he,
"It better to ratify the treaty and end tho war,
release the volunteers, rr=nove the excuxe for
war exuendlturs. and th>Â«n five to tha Fili
pinos thu independence which might be forced
from SDaln by n new treaty." Was the pres
ence of a few volunteers and the necessity for
war expenditures a more sericus menace to
the republic than the danger of Imperialism?
It is apparent from what he further Bays that
his surrtme desire was to create a new issue.
The - defeat - of the treaty would havo have
been the defeat of alleged Imperialism. But
it tniiut not be defeated, for an l.-suenmst he
maJe. The exigency of a political campaign
whs near at hand.
Imperialism a Sham and a Fraud.
Mr. Bryar. said if the Bacon resolution, wl ich
was Introduced nearly a month after the rati
fication of the treaty (and which uromlseti in
dependence to the Filipinos) had been adopted
by the Senate and carried out at the time the
treaty was ratified or thereafter, "It would
have taken the question of Imperialism r.ut of
politics." But the resolution was defeated.
It should be remembered that only a major
ity of the Senate was required. to pass the reso
lution", and tha Democrats were in the minor
ity; therefore without the power to pass the
resolution and take "the question out of poli
tics." Hut it required only one-third - of the
Scrate to defeat the treaty. Upon this propo
sition the Republicans were in the minority
and the Democrat* In the majority, with abso
lute power to defeat the treaty, and In that
way remove the question of Imperialism from
politics. - Senator Hoar, who strenuously op
pnsdd the treaty, thus . speaka of Â¦ Mr. ; Bryan'B
efforts: ..- .
"lie put forth all his power as a great party
leader. â¢ â¢ * to aecure the ratification of
the treaty. Net content with writing letters
he cai+i to Washington in person to overcome
the reluctance of his followers. Seventeen of
them voted for the treaty, of whom only four
or five at moat had been previously known to be
In its favor." . .
In view of all thla, the utter hypocrisy of
tho Imperialistic cry must be manifest to every
American citizen. I do not Indulge In extrava
gant language when I say that the issue of Im
perialism Is an unadulterated sham and fraud.
Dangers of a Protectorate. ,
Our Traditions Upheld.
This Is consistent with the exalted purpose
with which we entered upon the war with
cation. In the work of establishing: civil gov
ernment. In his last annual message he said:
"Until Congress shall have made known the
formal expression "of its .will I shall use the
authority vested In me by the constitution and
the statutes to uphold the sovereignty of the
Unlteil States in those distant islands, as In
r.ll other places where our flajc rightfully floats.
1 shall put at the disposal of the army and
navy all the m*ans which the liberality of
Congress anil the people have provided to cause
this unprovoked and wasteful Insurrection to
cease. If any orders of mine were required to
Insure the merciful conduct of military and
naval r>j>erat!r,ns thrv would not be lacking;
li\it every step of the proRTesR of our troops
has b*-(?n marked by a humanity which has
surprised even the mlÂ»pul<W insurgents. The
truest klndmÂ»?s to them will be a swift and
effective defeat of their present leader. The
hour of victory will be the hour of clemency
and reconstruction."

The effect of cofifee frequently pro-

panying distress, such as loss of appe-
tite, dyspepsia, bowel troubles, etc. A
lady from North Evanston, -111.. Mrs.
Eliza J. Stuart, 252% Hartzell avenue,
fays: "I had used coffee many years,
snd though I took great care in making
it, felt its ill effects very seriously. It
made" me bih'ous and robbed me of my
appetite for breakfast.
"I always had trouble with dyspepsia
while I used it. I was told by physi-
cians that I had catarrh of the stom-
ach, and came to believe there was no
help for cie. Two years ago I quit the
use of coffee and began to use Postum
Food Coffee. At first I missed the stim-
ulant, although the taste of the food cof-
fee was delicious.
"In a few days I forgot all about my
coffee in the satisfaction I derived from
Postum. and soon found that my appe-
tite returned, the bilious condition and
dyspepsia disappeared, so that now I am
proud to say that at the age of seventy-
five years I enjoy my food as well as
when young, and all my dyspeptic
symptoms and trouble of the stomach
have gone.
"These troubles had been with me for
most of my life and it is really remark-
able thit T am now so perfectly well. To
say that I am grateful does not express
it. Once in a while I find a person that
doÂ«s not like Pojtum. but I always find
:t is because it has not been properly

NEW YORK, Sept. 14.â Bradstreet'a to-mor
row will cay:
Expanding demand at advancing prices in
many lines of trades finds Its chief exemplar
In the market for raw cotton, which has wit
nessed the greatest excitement, heaviest trad
ing and largest ealn In price for at least a de
cade. Rarely. If ever, in the history of the
trade, as conducted on modern lines, has the
interest displayed on the product teen greater,
and the manufacturing interests of the world
find the situation a perplexlne one, while the
prospects of large profits to producers are stim
ulating all lines of Southern trade. English
eplnners. who are reported very generally short
of supplies, are considering drastic methods of
meeting the requirements. In American cot
ton markets the situation, from being a buyer's
market a short time a#ro, is now reversed and
sellers are in a position to dictate terms. So
suddenly has the outlook, as viewed by the
trade, generally changed, however,, that manu
facturers are unable or unwilling to define
their exact position, or, if they accept new
business, do so on a distinct basis of cost of
new supplies. Maximum cotton crop estimates
of past years are apparently panic-stricken and
predict famine stocks for the end of the year,
even with the reduced consumption.
Most food prices are either firm or higher on
the week, wheat being advanced on bettor ex
port demand ami bad weather at the North west,
proved by the low grade of much of the re
ceipts. Corn Is in good demand with ecant
supplies of old crop, and pork and lard pym
pathlze therewith. Raw sugar Is still scarce
and higher on the week, and coffee is fraction
ally higher. Among the great products which
are lower are butter and tea. Print cloths are
out of the market at old prices, and Southern
cotton yarns have advanced. Wool Is - still
rather weak, and the demand for spring weight
men's wear goods Is still disappointing..
The predicted anthracite coal miners"' strike
Is almost the only unfavorable feature of the
Industrial situation. The Iron and steel situ
ation has not materially cbangtHl and Irregu
larity In demand and prices la still a feature.
llather more talk Is heard of the influence of
election uncertainties upon future trade, and
certainly some additional weakness is told at
leading plgiron markets, while, on* the other
hand, finished material Is rather more firmly
held. ' Examples of this are afforded in the
weaker tone of plglron at Philadelphia and
Birmingham â¢ and .In the * placing ' of â¢ Bessemer
pig on a $14 basis at Pittsburgh. On the other
hand, some large sales . of pig * are noted . at
Chicago at DO cents advance, and Â¦Â¦Â¦ 25,000 tons
of plate* have been placed at that city/ at
firmer rates, while bars are active and highf.
Wire products are reported - well cleaned up
and stocks are light. More Is doing-. in : bars
at ether Western points. Hardware is in good
demand, and a good fall business s la likely.
The outlook ae to steel rail prices is unsettled,
but lower quotations are looked for. . ;;

and the transactions in the main are confined
to an exchange of contracts between profes
sionals. The public is out of .Wall street and
shows no Inclination to come In, while even
the investment demand for bonds and divi

The market was rot stimulated by the result
of the Maine election, which, it may be re
marked, was generally construed In a favor

continue to be the principal topic of discus

lief that while no political "scare" may deÂ»
velop. the uncertainties of the situation a3 re
gards the Presidency will continue to restrict
speculation and to render investors cautious.
In one department of the list there was an ap
pearance of genuine weakness, the anthracite
coal stocks declining: somewhat on the Increas
ing prospects of a miners' Btrike. Even In
this group, however, there was some supiwrt
shown at concessions, though the announce
ment, that the strike would in all probability
becin next week tended to create more or less
bearish talk and feeling in regard to th* gen
eral list. In this connection the bearings of
trouble with labor in such a great industry
as anthracite coal on the political outlook has
not been lost sight of by the street. London
seemed to take an unfavorable view of the
matter, but the London markets are sill dull

Africa and closed fairly cheerful. Americans
were under parity most of the time, though
New York offered some support. Uuslne.su In

NEW TORK, Sept. 14.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Pieview of Trade to-morrow will say:
The trouical storm that devastated the Gulf
coast, almost wiping out the city of Galveston
and doing damage in other parts of tho coun
try, caused a reduction In the volume of busi
ness at the South, and railroads in the Gulf
region have probably not ehown their maxi
mum losses of ' earnings . as yet; but even, after
Euch a catastrophe recuperative power is shown.
An added cause of hesitation in business la the
order for a strike of the anthracite coal min
ers. Otherwise the working force has Increased
this week, for operations are resuming at steel
mill3. and the; Michigan peninsula car plant
and the Deering Harvester Works have started
up after seven weeks' idleness with 3000 hands
each. â¢ Frcnv many Quarters of the \v est and
Southeast a better distribution- of merchandise
is reported in jobblnG Â¦ and- retail circles. rtio
weather has continued favorable for the matur
ing corn crop, with cutting progressing and
the crop generally beyond danger; but. damaso
to cotton by the storm Is still an unknown
quantity. I'rices "of staple commodities .are
higher for the week, hoisted- by the sharp rise
In cotton, but in manufactured products there
is little change, though steady increase of busi
ness at the current level la satisfactory, cot
ton closed last veek at the highest price m ten
years, and . a large short interest was await
ing reaction. Instead there came newa of the
disaster in Texas and sensational reports that
a million bales had been destroyed.- At the
New York Exchange trading was far in ex
cess of all previous records, and prices rose by.
bounds. Subsequently there were .less exag
gerated reports from the South, but the market
failed to respond, and middling uplands ad
vanced to 11 cents. The rise in the raw mate
rial caused sharp advances In cotton good*. In
ono week- standard brown sheetings rose from
5.67c to Cc, wide bleached sheetings from 20o
to 21c, standard brown drills from 6.67c to o. 87c
and staple ginghams from 6c to 6.50o.
Buyers who have been delaying for weeks
aro anxious to secure liberal supplies, both'In
stant ' and distant.
Stocks in first hands were cleaned up and
sellers generally withdrew from tna market.
Wheat rose above 80c again in the face cf
receipts for the crop year thus Â£ar 8,413,3i5
bushels larger than last year, while exports de
creased 10,251,37s bughels, including flour. Re
ports of heavy rains in some sections ind In
jury to the crop with better inquiries by for
eign houses Â¦ explain the advance.
More orders are being received at Iron mills
and prices are steady. In structural and fin
ished materlr.l there is much business and ac
tivity is becoming almost universal In the Iron
region. Steel rails are awaiting for the agree
ment as to prices, which is expected to be
reached next week.' A reduction in keeping
with other steel products 1b considerÂ».Â«l certain,
and thfen the market will be on a settled basis.
Seme large makers favor $27 EO as the new
basis and believe that nearly 2.000.0UO tons
would be ordered at that figure.
Shipbuilding was never more active, and a
feature was a contract for a coal pier to be
used in the export trade.
Boots and shoes begin to recover after many
weeks of Idle wheels through New England.
Orders are comlne forward freely and a re
turn to normal conditions Is in prospect.
Last week's shipments from Boston were only
67.142 cases, which is the smallest amount
since the decline began, but increasing pur
chases promise an early gain in forwardlng3.
Conditions ore similar In the wool ir.fi.rket,
where rales last week aggregated 2,623,000
pounds, against 12.0C6.5O0 pounds a year age.
Prices do not fall as might be expected in such
a dull season.
Failures for the week were 195 in the United
States, ajralnst H9 last year and 30. in Canada,
against Â£ last year.

Harrison's circular says:
"There have been the foUaÂ»r!ng datlverlea of
coal this week: Four from British Columbia
with 12.290 tons; two from Washington. $520
tons; one from Oregon. 400 tons; one from
Swansea, 2756 tons: total. 23,948 tons. We art
short this week fully 5000 tons from the amount
absolutely needed, which will force us to draw
from the small reserves now In yard. Tho
near approach of winter months will of eoume
create an Increased call for fuel for domestfts
use: for this Â¦we axe very poorly equipped, but
there is yet ample time to make provision for
same within the next thirty or forty days, by
shifting their shipments from steam to domes
tic rrades. The absolute control of the <uet
market Is In the hands of flro colliery proprie
tors In British Columbia and Washington, as
the sparse arrivals of foreign grades cut no
figure whatever In this market. Crude oil Is
proving a substantial leaning post at this crit
ical season, and la serving to establish a uni
form value for all fuels, and there seems no
disposition on the part of well owners to In
crease their present standard prices. With the
numberless wells now being sunk In different
sections we may well feel assured that the
quantity produced will Increase for several
years to come. Hence it will eventually be
come one of the main factors in making the
market price for fuel locally."

mous quantities and collect from j that
county^the bounty allowed .for the killing

Fire Department Telephones.
Auditor Wells announced yesterday that
he will not permit the Fire Commission
to pay for Its telephones out of the funds
appropriated to its use. The decision of
the special committee to order the com
mission to pay for Its own telephones is
held by the Auditor to be a violation of
tho charter, though It- was acquiesced in
bv the Mayor. \The Fire Department tele
phones cost $400 per month, and the Au
ditor's decision will complicate the diffi
culties arising over the special appropria
tion for teleohones. which .was reduced
from $15,000 last year to $7000 for this.
The News Litter Sounds Its Note to
Awaken the People to Re
newed Efforts.
A special number cf the News Letter,
i illustrating California industries, will be
! out to-day. In a leading article the scope
i of the number is set forth with refreshing
vigor and breeriness. "San Francisco,"
fo reads the text, "needs more boosters.
' boasters and enthusiasts: more local pride
Â¦ and spirit, more business glneer. â¢ â¢ â¢
! We are too conservative, too timid as to
i our own resources. There is more than
! climate in and about San Francisco. Line
! up. fellow citizens, and take notice. Our
| manufactories support between 30.000 and
i 40.000 people. They ought to support be
tween 300,000 and 400,000. It is our fault

His Escape.
Albert Lukes, the youth who stabbed
and killed seventeen-year-old Daniel Har
ney on Mason street about two weeks ago
and who has been a fugitive since that
time, gave Special Police Officer William
Thompson an exciting run last evening,
finally escaping in the crowds in China
town. <
Special Officer Thompson and Policeman
James Connolly spent several days on
the trail of Lukes after the crime was
committed. â¢ They were both well ac
quainted with the culprit, he having re
sided in their district. Recently Connolly
resumed his beat and the chase was for
a time given up. The police .were con
fident, however, that Lukes had not lefr
the city and his description was read to
every officer in the department.
Last night Thompson saw Lukes on
Jackson street in the company of two
other boys. The policeman immediately
gave chase and the trio turned Into Powell
street. From Powell they rushed Into
Washington and were soon in Chinatown.
Once !n the Chinese quarter the three
mingled in the crowds and escaped into
an alley. Thompson spent some time at
tempting to get on the trail again, but
was unsuccessful. â¢ .

Theodore Weise. proprietor of the West
ern Bottling Works at Sixth and Klnx
streets, was arrested ytsterday afternoon
on a warrant Issued out of Judge Conlan'Â»
court charging him with receiving stolen
property. The complaint was sworn to by
Peter Lewin, a detective for the Southern
Pacitlc Company. Weise was released on
$100 cash pall.
The officials of the company have been
missing bales of hay Iv>m the yard that
adjoins Welse's bottling works and Lewm
was 'detailed to investicate. He kept a
close watch on the yard and Thursday af
ternoon he saw. George Webster, a team
ster In Weise's employ, drive Into the yard
and load a bale of Lay Into his wagon.
Lcwln promptly placed Webster under ar
rest and when nuestioned he admitted
that he had been stealing the bales and
that Welse had connived at the thefta.
Lewln went to VVttet'l bam and dis
covered two other bnlrs of hay that had
been stolen and in the lift was a largs
quantity of hay. but as it was loose there
was ro means of lu~nti*yir.g it as the
property of the company.
"I spoke to Weisc about It," said Lawtn
yesterday, "and he seamed to treat tho
matter with indifference. He said he was
willing to pay for the two bales In his
barn and there was no use of making any
bother About it. After I reported the
facts I was instructed to have him arrest
ed for receiving stolen property."
Webster, the teamster, appeared before
Judge Conlan yesterday but the case was
continued Jr. view of the fact that the
warrant had been sworn out for Welse's
arrest and the nroseoutlon wanted both
cases tried at the same time. Attorney
Frank Kelly, who represents the com
pany, said yesterday that the cases would

JAPANESE ATTEMPT TO
SHUT OUT WHITE GIRLS
S. Mlho, a Japanese cigarette-maker,
has sued the John Bollman Company to
recover $299 99 for alleged breach of con
tract. Mr. Bollman employed white glrla
to make cigarettes and Miho claims that
Bollman agreed to employ only Japanese.
In other words, the Japanese tried to shut
American girls out of work In an Amer
ican factory- They formed a union anJ
for a time' forced Bollman to give them
the work. He sent East and engaged
an expert to come here to instruct Rirls
to make cigarettes. They learned
quickly and gradually displaced the
Japanese. Then the members of the
Japanese trades union broke away and
sought work at less price than they had
demanded. Some were permitted to work.
Mlho sues not only Bollman, but also
a member of the Japanese Cigarette
makers' Union to collect a fine as a pen
alty for breaking the rules of the organi
zation.
Mr. Bollman says that he is replacing
the Japanese with white girls as fast as
possible.

pected to vote. s ' Â» Zi
So much was decided last night at a
meeting of the Democratic County Cen
tral Committee at Native Sons' Hall. Two
members of the committee had the
temerity to suggest that the opposition,
where there was any, should be allowed

committee would attsiid to little details
of the programme such as that and they
dutifully subsided. -
Jasper McDonald, chairman of the

ent at the meeting, and on motion of
"Orator" Thomas Hit key "RoEy" Ma

ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE.
An.lrew G. Maguire, chairman; Thomas E.
Curran, secretary; M. C. Hassett, P. J. To
malty. George McGillivray. Dr. Thomas B. W.
I Inland and Samuel Braunhart.
J. F. Renault of the Thirty-first Dis
trict asked whether the primary was to
be run as the last one for the choice of
delegates to the State Convention without
allowing the opposition to have represen
tation at the polling places. Curran ex
plained that the question would be one
for the organization committee to de
cide. A motion waj hastily made and
carried adopting the itport of the com-
I mltlee ar.d ordering the call for the prl
i mary issued.
Victor Martini of the Forty-fourth Dis
trict, somewhat later in the meeting,
brought the question up again and de
manded a roll call on it. Maguire told him
he was out of order, that the organiza
tion committee would look out for that
detail. The committee promptly ad
journed in order to prevent any unpleas
ant discussion of Gavin McNab's plan for
a hermetically sealed primary.
Before the Martini Incident Thomas E.
Curran called attention to the need of
rapid registration of voters who had neg
lected to attend to that matter. County
committeemen were urped to remind vot
i r-rs of their districts of the necessity of
j registering at once.
On motion of M. C. Hassett the chair
man v/as authorized to appoint a commit
tee of five to consult v.ith the State Cen
tral Committee on matters of common

Cannon Balls Made of Gold.
It was before the days of the dum-dum
bullet that gold and silver bullets and
cannon balls were fired at an enemy.
When the Indian city of Anadnagar was
besieged by Emperor Akbar, Princess
Cande who defended it. before her capit
ulation caused all the gold and ellver to
be molded into bullets on which were en
graved maledictions against the oppres
sor. These were fired by cannon into the
jungle, where many of Them have since
been found. An old peasant, who died not
long ago, in his early days picked up one
of these valuable cannon balls, which waa
pure Â«gold and weighed eight pounds.â

read. Attorney Riordan asked for a con
tinuance. Judge Cook refused to enter
tain the motion, however, and after in
structing Drs. Lustlg and Rethers to
make a further examination of the pa
tient, issued a bench warrant for. her ar
rest and production in court. The war
rant was placed In the hands, of Sheriff
Lockmann , and was i served Â¦ by Deputy
Sheriffs William Dasha, Dan Farley and
John "Waible. Drs. Rethers and Lustlg
called and examined Mrs. Craven at the
Palace Hotel. : After they left the room
the Sheriff prepared to take Mrs. Craven
to court. A hack was pressed into ser
vice and after much labor Mrs. Craven
was carried .downstairs and the journey
to. the City Hall began. Before Mrs.
Craven's arrival in court Judge Cook
called Dr. Lustig to the stand to testify
as to her condition. Dr. Lustig said he
had made a further examination of the
patient. "In my opinion," he said, "Mrs.
Craven can be brought to court. There
is an apparent loss of mobility of her
limbs, but I believe there is an effort on
her part to suppress action. I could find
no difference of temperature in her limbs
and at times I noticed a movement of the
same, which, in my opinion, prove her
ability to move the same if she so de
sired."
Judge Cook was about to make another
order commanding the immediate produc
tion of the accused In court, when she
entered, carried by four men. Men and
women turned and glanced Into one an
other's faces. For the first time In their
lives they had seen a defendant, ill be
yond question and maybe unto death, car
ried Into a court of Justice that she might
be arraigned and the prosecution's clamor
for a hasty trial duly honored by the
court.
Mrs. Craven Denies She Is Insane.
"Although my left arm is paralyzed
thank God I can still raise my right In
any court In the land and swear to the
truth," said Mrs. Craven when seen at her
rooms in the California Hotel last night.
"I do not think that Judge Cook knew
how ill I really was," eald she, "when he
sent the Sheriff after me this morning. If
he could only have guessed how anxious
I myself was to go before Judge and jury
and clear my reputation! I value my rep
utation much more than any monetary
consideration. Rather than not b'e cleared
of this charge I would die, but I tell you
my death wouldn't end the Fair case.
Nervous prostration is what I am suffer

MRS. STETTTE R. CRAVEN ts
paying a terrible penalty for
the battle the waged for some
of the millions of James G.
Fair. By the order of Judge
Carroll Cook etie was forced to
rlee from a bed of dangerous Illness and
appear before the bar of the court. Part
ly paralyzed, wan from sickness, mental
ted physical, ero&ol&ted to a shadow of

were the merits of her great contest, her
condition, almost utterly hopeless. ex-
Cited pity even from her accusers, from
the Fair attorneya who surrounded her
watchfully, from the iwlvat* detectives
who t-ad followed her to the very doors
cf tte courtroom. She was breathing
heavily and Quickly and In too apparent
distress. She was mambUng Incoherently
of her battle* In other courts. Now and
acrain her eyes wwild open, heavily and
gaxe listlessly at the faces around her.
She was on the border of mental and phy
sical ruin.
Forced From a Sick Bed Into Court.
In such a condition, against the protest
of three reputable phyeldans, against the
pleading cf the few friends who remain
to her. against the earnest objection of
her attorney, she was ordered to appear
In court by Judge Cook and answer to the
charge against her. Judge Cook was as
sured in every reasonable way that the
woman wbjb mentally and physically un
abls to leave her bed. He was even asked
to go to her himself and convince himself
of her condition: but he refused, and is
sued a bench -warrant for her arrest.
Two Deputy Sheriffs went to her apart
ments In the PaJace Hotel. She was In
bed. but was commanded to rise, dress
and po with the officers to the City Hall.
She complied and one of the deputies re
turned to the room, when she had dressed,
lifted her In his arms and placed her In
a chair. With the assistance of other
efflcers and her physician the was carried
down Ftalrs to a carriage which was wait-
Ing at the JP5?ie street entrance. It

her face.
Arraigned and Given Time to Plead.
The carriage was drawn rapidly to tho
City Hall, where ajrain Mrs. Craven was
lifted out and carried to the elevator in
the City Hall. She was wheeled along tho
corridor to the courtroom and In such
fashion she went to be arraigned. Judg
Cook demanded that she immediately
plfad. Her attorney asked a continuance
and the court refused it. The District Al
t^rnoy remarked that he paw no harm in
granting the request and Mrs. Craven
was= priven until next Saturday In which
to plead. The army of attorneys, private
detectives and spectators flocked out into
the corridor and Mrs. Craven was wheeled
into the Judge'6 chambers.
A new distress had come upon her. The
manager of the Palace Hotel had sent
word that she could not return and she
had nowhere to go. Her physician
hastened to peek a place and returned
with the Information that she could havt
apartments at the California Hotel. Again
she was wheeled along the corridors. Into
the elevator and out to a waiting car
riage. As the vehicle rumbled away on6
of the deputies whose disagreeable duty
it had been to bring Mrs. Cravc-n into
court said: "That woman will never be
placed on trial; Fhe will be in a coffin or
a madhouse first. " One of the most re

local court of justice had ended.

BY JUDGE COOK INTO COURT TO BE ARRAIGNED

In a- communication to the court, dated
September 11, Dr. E. S. Howard, adjunct
to, the chair of surgery and demonstrator
' In his report. Dr. Max Saloman, city
physician of tho German General Benevo
lent Society, said: . Â¦
"This is to certify that on the night of
September 8 I was called to see Mrs. Net
tle Craven, in order to have her trans
ported to the German Hospital of this
city. I found patient lying on her bed
suffering from a hemiplegla of left side.
Left leg. complete loss of motion and sen
sation. Pricking with sharp point of pin
elicited no sound from patient, conse
quently did not produce sensation of pain.
Left arm In similar condition, with ex
ception of two fingers which , could be
slightly moved at will. Diagnosis: Hys
terical hemiplegla. Further examination
proved patient to be j mentally deranged.
Her incoherent, disconnected conversa
tion,-accompanied by outbursts of temper,
becoming, in fact, violent, necessitated
my refusing to accept her as a patient at
the German Hospital, since the rules of
the Institution prohibit the taking of pa
tients not of sound mind.".
Reports of the Physicians.
Judge Cook again called for Mrs.
Craven. She was still absent and Dr. D.
D. Lustlg was called to the stand. Before
Dr. Lustig was called upon to testify,
however. Attorney Riordan, on behalf of
Mrs. Craven, asked for a continuance.
He presented three communications from
Drs. Salopian. D'Evelyn and Howard;
These physicians all agreed that Mrs.
Craven j was in no physical condition to
go to court and all had grave doubts as
to her sanity.
Craven was carried downstairs to her car
riage.
Mrs. Craven had been ordered to appear
In ccAirt yesterday morning for arraign
ment. She was not present, but among
those who anxiously awaited her coming
were George :W. Slmpton, the Sausallto
Justice of the Peace, and Adolph Sylva.
Slmpton and Sylva were soon disturbed
from their meditation by the order of the
court, for their arraignment. The Ions
Indictments, charging Sylva â¢with subor
nation of perjury and Simpton with per
jury, were read. At the suggestion of.
their counsel the defendants were given
until the 17th inst. to plead.

Captain Seymour and his men are look
ing for a brace of burglars who entered
the residence of Mrs. Foster, 3716 Jackson
street, about a week ago. 'The burglar*,
carried off a large quantity of wearing
apparel and jewelry, valued at several
hundred dollars, and ev*n took the lace
curtains which adorned the front win
dows.
Mrs. Foster and her family had gone
to visit some relatives in the country.
Yesterday morning they returned to this
city and on entering their home they were
surprised to find that it had been looted.
The burglars gained an entrance by pry
ing open a rear window. They broke open
closets and bureau drawers and even
ripped up the carpets,, so determined were
they not to overlook anything of value.
The woman who lives next door says
that a short time before the burglary she
saw two men drive up to the house in a
wagon. One of them remained on the
sidewalk while the other rang the front
door bell. Falling to get a response he
went around to the rear. Thinking they
were peddlers the woman paid no further
attention to them.
Captain Seymour has the name of a boy
who caw 5 the men leaving the house. They
placed their booty in the wagon and hur
riedly drove away.
The police are satisfied that the burglars
are the same men who have been operat
ing with considerable success in the West
ern Addition for some Â¦ time past. They
operate under the guise of peddlers.

"That Mrs. Craven Is 111 and in no
physical condition to appear in court must
be palpable to your . Honor and to
counsel," said Mr. Riordan. "That it Is a
labor to bring her back to court is her
misfortune and a misfortune which tho
court should duly consider. Your Honor
can perceive that Mrs. Craven Is in no
physical or mental condition to be sub
jected to annoyance. The people of San
Francisco are not going to suffer If we
give this defendant an opportunity to re
cuperate; neither will the court suffer
nor counsel, nor her accusers."
At this point Assistant District Attor
ney Deuprey arose and said that he saw
no reason why the continuance asked for
should not be granted. Judge Cook,
however, stated he would not be In court
on the day named by counsel and again
requested that Mrs. Craven be instructed
to plead to the indictment, reserving the
right for her counsel to withdraw the
same, however. If he saw the necessity
for so doing in the future. Mr. Riordan
insisted upon a continuance, however, and
finally it was granted, Saturday, Septem
ber 22, being set as the day upon which
Mrs. Craven must plead.
The continuance granting an adjourn
ment was ordered.
Grave Doubts of Her Sanity.
Court bailiffs immediately cleared the
court, leaving Mrs. Craven, her lawyers
and physician. Dr. Clinton, undisturbed.
Mrs. Craven was carried " into Judge
Cook's chambers, for word had been re
ceived that she would not again be-.re
ceived at the hotel from which she was
taken and new . apartments must be
sought. After being an hour in the cham
bers, apartments were located and Mrs.
drew Osen's drug- store, at "the corner of
Mason and Geary streets, and purchased
50 cents' worth of carbolic acid. ; The
clerk said. she was cool and collected and
while he was preparing it she examined
some articles on the showcase.
Returning to the J^anghanr Miss Gold
berg met several frelnds, who invited her
to Join them in a drink. She accepted the
invitation, 'â¢ but had not been seated long
when she begged to be excused for a mo
ment. She went direct to the lavatory
and there swallowed an ounce and a half
of the acid. She started to go out, but
fell on the way and was picked up by
cne of the attendants in the hotel. Sev
eral of her friends w r orked over ; her for
about five minutes : before the ambulance
was sent for. They wanted her I taken
home "Instead of , to the hospital. Â¦ .
At the hospital Dr. Bachigulpl worked
over her for three hours, using an electric
battery and- other remedies . to stay
off sleepiness. , but she rallied very little
and the doctor stated early this morning
that he entertained little hope for her re
covery. . â¢
Ullman was placed under arrest. He
says if he had known the sirl had 'In

have followed her from the hotel... "
Miss Goldberg's parents live . at tho
corner of Seventh and Schrader â¢ streets.
Her brother.' who is an electric car con
ductor, visited the hospital at midnight
and identified her.
For an instant the old spirit that has car
ried Mrs. Craven through so many legal
battles flashed in her eyes.
"That Is not my true name," she said,
positively, a half smile on her lips. "My
true name is Xettle R. Craven-Fair."
Clerk Tolle hesitated long enough to make
the change, and then began the wearisome
reading of the document. The reading oc
cupied fifteen or twenty minutes. At
times Mrs. Craven raised her eyes and
scanned the document the clerk was read
ing, only to close them again and support
her head with her emaciated hands. The
scene was dramatic in the extreme, and
more than once the whisper was heard
that the prosecution of Nettle R. Craven
had ceased to be prosecution and had be
come persecution.
Continuance Grudgingly Given.
At the conclusion of the arraignment
Mrs. Craven opened her eyes and looked
appealingrly at her counsel, Thomas D.
Riordan. Mr. Riordan arose and asked ;
the court for a continuance until Tuesday,
at which time he said Mrs. Craven would
be ready to plead. Judge Cook objected
to granting the continuance. "From a
cursory examination of the indictment,"
said Mr. Riordan, "I am of the opinion
that It is demurrable. I will also be
frank and state that I intend to challenge
the Grand Jury panel upon other grounds.
I will also make a motion to quash the
indictment. It is my opinion that before
my client is called upon to plead these
motions should be disposed of by the
court."
"If the defendant pleads now," said
Judge Cook, "It will save the necessity
and labor of again bringing her back to
court."

Jilted by Her Lover Gussie
Goldberg Seeks an
When Jack Ullman, a traveling sales
man, told pretty Gussle Goldberg to pack
up her belongings and get out, that he
did hot want to set eyes on her again, he
little realized the consequences of that
sudden outburst of Jealous passion. The
girl, driven to distraction, saw relief only
in death, and when she left Ullman at the
Lepalmer Hotel, at half-past ;il -o'clock
last evening it was for no other purpose
than to end life in what seemed to her an
ungrateful world. From the ' hotel she
went to a drugstore, purchased 50 cents*
worth of carbolic acid and drank a third
of It. The physicians say there is no hope
for her recovery. .
According to Ullman, he had known the
(ioldberg girl for about a year. He met
her at a uance, and after that they were
together a good deal when he was not out
of the city on business. Her home is in
this city, but she had not seen her parents
for several months. .She is about 23, a
pronounced blonde, with well-molded fea
tures. Upon returning from Chicago about
a month ago Ullman took apartments at.
the Lepalmt-r and the'Goldberg girl' was
a frequent visitor to his rooms.-,.
Last evening, shortly after 6 Â¦ o'clock,
Ullman saw the girl talking to a young
man on Mason street, ncar.tho corner of
Ellis. He did not create a scene then.', but
when Miss Goldberg came to the hotel a
few minutes later he accused her of being
unfaithful and ordered her to get out.
She asked him for enough money to take
her home, but he refused, stating after
ward that he feared she might purchase
poison with the money, she having fre
quently told him that. if she ever had a
tailing out she would kill herself.
From the hotel the girl went to the
1 m ngham Hotel, on Ellis street, and bor
rowed 50 cents from a woman whom she
knew. Then she asked to be trusted for
a drink. From the hotel she went to An-
