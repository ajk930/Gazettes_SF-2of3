of the campaign that no or.e who is sup
posed to report important facts can ignore
them. They are so numerous as to com
pel the conclusion that they are not iso
jated episodes, but the ordinary practices
of Russian methods of warfare.
The Russians on the walls of Peking
would apparently shoot every Chiense
within range outside. A correspondent of
the Associated Press found many newly
killed in the fields outside of the Russian
section of the wall. Some of the bodies
were those of women, and none seemed
to be the bodies of combatants. Coolies
were,killed while trotting along the roads
with their loads, and farmers when try
ins to gather in their grain. ,.. ,
"The relief of Peking Is merely an inci
dent of the crisis. The really important
work remains to be done. Marquis Ito,
probably the best Informed man alive on
Eastern politics, said. to me that the pres

"There has been a deliberately planned
movement on the part of the Chinese
Government to expel all foreigners. The
decrees printed In the Imperial Gazette
prove this. The movement has been prac
tically successful, since every foreigner in
the interior has been obliged to seek
refuge in the treaty ports. The Imperial
Government merely utilized the Boxers as
convenient accessories to its schemes.
Proved by Imperial Decree.
"If the Chinese Government is able to
break the concert of nations and to bring
about a disagreement on the part of any
Government in such a way as to secure
any relaxation of the joint demands, all
the foreigners in China may as well pack
up and leave. This is the best opportunity
to settle for all time the status of for
eigners in China. If that matter Is not
settled now the Chinese will be encouraged
to persist In their present policy, and the
powers will have the whole trouble to
thrash over again every two or three
years. I believe that all the governments
are impressed with this truth, and I be
lieve that most of them realize that a
definite and permanent settlement of the
status of foreigners and the establishment
of freedom of trade are more important
to them now than the acquisition of terri
tory. . . _

Li Hung Chang still remains in Shang

Is intriguing to get the foreigners to quar

American and English diplomats that the
Russians had promised to withdraw from
Peking regardless of the policy of other

On tho contrary, it Is Is thought probable
that he is simultaneously assuring the

Chinese conceit of their own superiority?"
LOXDOX. Sept. 3, 4 a. m. â The piiolication of the text of
the Russian proposals has intensified rather than dimin
ished the suspicions entertained by England of Russia's
proceedings. The rupture of the European concert is consid
ered an accomplished fact. Opinions differ, however, as to the
way in which the powers will now group themselves. Some
papers think that Great Britain, Japan and the triple alliance
will stand together in refusing to leave Peking.
The Daily Telegraph, which expresses regret that Presi
dent McKinley "has committed the United States to follow the
Russians." considers, however, that Japan, whose consistent pol
icy since the war of 1894 has been to conciliate the effect of a
rapprochement with China, ''will throw her lot in with Russia
and will be reluctantly followed by France, who does not dare to
risk a divergence w-ith Russia.
"Events have therefore conspired," says the Daily Tele
graph," to throw the balance of diplomatic power into Lord
Salisbury's, hands, for Italy and- Austria must side with Ger
many, which will probably propose some compromise and be
supported by England."
It Is Asserted That Great Britain,
Japan and the Triple Alli
ance Will Stand Together

train was r-ent from Uethlehem, hut be- ;
fore It reached the scree of the wreck it '
was signaled to return to Bethlehem, as
a special carrying nearly all the injured i
had started for that place. On the run
from Hatfieid to the hospital three of the
Injured died. Great trouble was experi
enced in keeping the relatives away from !
the Injured on the train so that the doc- :
tors gathered from near Hatfield could
attend to the wounded.
Second Section Escaped.
The special train arrived at Bethlehem at
i 11:30 and was met by fully live thousand
J person?, all clamoring to get a bit of
; news from the wreck or trying to learn
whether loved ones were among the vic
tims. The news of the wreck had reached
Bethlehem at 8 o # clock and spread like
I wildfire. All the policemen in town were
j gathered at the station, and it was with
i great difficulty that the injured were re
i moved to the waiting ambulances and
j other vehicles which conveyed them to
! the hospitals. All during the day people
I from AUentown, Catasaqua and other
; places came pouring into Hethlchem, and
i confusion reigned throughout the city.
I The second section of the excursion,
i made up of persona from towns other
than Bethlehem and AUentown, left soon
Â¦ after the first section, but was flagged
; before it reached Hatfield. As It could
\ rot pet through on account of the blocked
i iracks it was returned to Bethlehem, and
i there was great rejoicing at the narrow
| escape of its occupants from the catas
j trophe.
The Coroner of Montgomery County
; visited the wreck early anrÂ» spent the tn
, tire day at the scene. He at once directed
j the removal of the dead to I^ansdale, u
I short distance south of Hatfield. He
; promises a rigorous investigation rhto the
i horror.
Responsibility Not Fixed.
There are conflicting stories as to the
i responsibility for the accident. One ver
Â¦ sion is that the engineer of the excursion
; train had been warned at Souderton, the
, station above Hatfield. that the milk train
. was a few minutes ahead of him. An
j other etory is that the train dispatchers'
j office at Philadelphia was at fault. The
\ trainmen refused to talk of the accident.
Fifteen hundred tickets had been sold
: for the excursion to the seashore and it
Â¦ was to have been the last of the season.
W. II. Rccenberry of Lansdale; a Rep
' resent*tlve in the Pennsylvania House of

Ereclal Dispatch to The Call
FOLSOM. Sept. 2.â Lying: in the j
kitchens of the houses on |
each of two dairy ranches, three i
mil^s from Folsom. the decom- j
po^ed bodies of two farmhands i
were found to-day. They had j
been shot to death by unknown |
assassins and the houses ransacked from i
top to bottom. The dead men are Wil-
Itam Taylor and Hans Rasmussen. The |
Coroner's Jury that f^at to-day at the !
ranches of the Parazzo brothers and Wll* j
Ham Carpenter, where the crimes oc- i
currod. returned a verdict In each cafe j
of "death from bullet-wounds received at >
the hands of a party or parties unknown." j
There is r.o dew that would lead to the !
clearing of the mystery that shrouds the j
taking off of the?e i-imple farmhands â !
whether they were slain in the light of j
day, and realized the fate that was to
befall them; whether they were lured to I
the windows Jn the night, when death !
carne to them swiftly from the rifle or j
rifles of an unknown assassin or assas- |
sins, may never be known. Certain It Is j
that they were shot down In cold blood, j
Robbery or Revenge?
But. whether it was revenge or robbery j
that inspired the murderous deed, Is not j
known. Apparently, the motive was rob- j
bery, for the houses had been searched, j
Yet there fr.uld have been eo little of j
value on the premises that the disar
rangement of the furniture may have !
been planned to avert suspicion that re- j
venge prompted the slaying.
The horror of the crimes has sent a \
thrill of terror to the heart of the stoutest i
and bravest of farmers and farmhands. |
for no one knows where the fell bolt of j
assassination may strike nextâ who will j
fall victim to the unknown thug or thugs, j
Weird, creepy and awful were the tale<? i
of murder that were brought to this
town this morning, by Antone Prisser
and Henry Glincamp. Prisser came white
as to face and with trembling limbs to
tell of the grisly thing he had seen when
he went Into the kitchen of the ranch
: house on the dairy farm of Perazzo
! Brothers early this morning. Glincamp
| came later with the tale of a haunting
i fear that evil must have happened to the
j kindly Swede farmhand who looked after
j the Carpenter place, for the Swede had
i not been seen for several days. His
Â¦ fears proved to be well-founded, for, like
Taylor, Rasmuspen's bullet-riddled body
! lay in the other lonely ranch-house.
Prisser's Grew3ome Discovery.
Here is the tale as related by Prisser.
Antone Prisser, who lives a short dis
j tance from the Perazzo ranch, went, as
j was his custom, to the Perazzo ranch to
deliver some mail to William Taylor. Not
j finding him at the house and the doors
i being locked, he started toward the barn.
j Taylor's dog espied Prisser and followed
I him. whining piteously and now and then
I turning back towards the house. The
I dog's actions were so peculiar that Prisser
j decided to go back to the house. Again
i he tried the door and windows. Coming
! to the kitchen window, he found It un
i fastened, and raising it he climbed into
the house. As he entered his eyes behelrt
a. recumbent form, and a cold shiver ran
! over him. Approaching the figure, Prisser
I stooped over. The man was Taylor and
he was dead. .Prisser fled the grewsome
scene and hastened to Folsom, where he
notified the authorities.
Officer Donnelly went to the ranch.
When he examined the body of Taylor
he found that the farmhand had b,eer.
killed. Three jagged bullet woundsâ on?
' in the forehead, one in the abdomen and
I one in the handâ told a tale of murder
most foul. In the window-casing was an
other bulletâ a missile that had missed it-s
human target. It had come from a 44
caliber rifle.
Evidence of Foul Murder.
There were no evidences of a struggle
anywhere. Taylor had been slain by a
thug who had coolly planned the murder
ous deed and as coolly executed it. The
condition of articles, in the various rooms,
showed that the house had been thor
oughly seached. perhaps for money, per
haps to hide the motive for the crime.
There was only one weapon in the house â
a rifle. But it contained no empty shell
and boro no signs of recent use. All the
doors and windows, save ' the kitchen
window, through which the murderer ev
i idently made his escape, had been secure
ly fastened. One of the bullets that went
through the window ranged upward, lead
ing to the conclusion that the slayer was
fitting or lying down when he fired on
Taylor.
After this thorough examination Offi
cer Donnelly returned to Folsom and tel
ephoned to Sheriff Johnson of Sacramen
to County, Coroner McMullan and Dis
trict Attorney Baker, informing them of
the facts and urging them to come to
Fo!som at once.
The Fate of Rasmussen.
A few minutes later Henry Glincamp, a
farmer residing near the Carpenter ranch,
which is two miles distant from the Pe
razzos* ranch. Informed Officer Donnelly
that Hans Rasmussen, the keeper of the
ranch, had not been seen for several days
and that he feared that something was

BERLIN, Sept. 2.â Owing to the un

ings owing to the Hoboken disaster and
to the chartering of passenger steamers
by the German Government for use in
Chinese waters, many American citizens
have recently been compelled to take

The physicians of the North German

LETTER CARRIERS ARE
GATHERING IN DETROIT
Many Delegates to the Convention of
the National Association on
the Ground.
DETROIT, Sept. 2.â Some 400 members
of the National Association of Letter Car
riers had arrived this evening to attend
the annual meeting of the association to
be held this week. The early arrivals
came quite largely from the East and
Middle West. The presence of the letter
carriers will result in two Labor day pa
rades to-morrow.
Officers of the association announce
that it has now a membership of 16,000
with 745 local branches, and that all the
Government letter carriers in the country,
with the exception of about 1000, are in
cluded In its membership. As usual in
the annual meetings, the principal sub
jects of discussion relate, to possible legis
lation by Congress affecting' letter" car
riers. Increases of salaries to uniform
rates for carriers of both tho first and
second class Is to be urged. Carriers of
postoffices of the first class now receive
$1000 and of the second class $Sr>0. What
the men desire is a uniform salary of
SI 200.
The question of pensions for infirm and
disabled letter carriers, which has been
discupsed for some years, has resulted in
the preparation of a bill providing for
payment of such pensions by a specially
appointed officer of the Postofflce Depart
ment of such pensions by a specially, ap
pointed officer of the Postofflce Depart
ment out of a fund raised by assessing
each carrier 1 per cent of his salary. The
bill provides for administration â¢ of " the

Regards Pennsylvania Stock as Best
Sceclal Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 2.â William K. Van
derbllt's purchase of additional stock in
the Pennsylvania Railroad is a subject ol
lively gossip in railroad circles.
The old report that the New York Cen
tral and the Pennsylvania would also ab
sorb the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was
revived yesterday, but was denied by one
of Mr. Vanderbilt's closest friends, who
Eaid to a Call correspondent:
"I cannot speak for other stockholders
of the Pennsylvania and the New York
Central, but as far as Mr. Vanderbilt, the
largest stockholder, is individually con
cerned he would not have the. Baltimore
and Ohio Railroad as a gift. The road is
run down and has not for many years
been a serious competitor of either the
Pennsylvania or the New York Central.
i Its passenger traffic has continually de
creased. Mr. Vanderbllt cares nothing for
the Baltimore and Ohio, but had long been
I anxious to acquire control of the Pennsyl
i vania which he regarded as the finest
railroad property in the world, not ex
cepting the New York Central. I will Bay
I that If Mr. Vanderbllt makes more largo
purchases of railroad stock with a view
to control It will be in the West. It hab
1 long been the ambition of the Vanderbiltss
! to own a road to the Pacific Coast."
GLENWOOD SPRINGS. Co'lo.. Sept. 2.â
To-day's session of the conference of rail
road officials who have been here for sev
eral days discussing the outlines of a
transcontinental passenger association
was only one hour in length. The com
mittees at work upon a plan were not
ready to report and the meeting adjourned
until to-morrow at 10 o'clock.
Discussing the question of the handling
of Government troop3 and the recent or
der of the quartermaster general of the
United States army to the effect that all
troops to be carried to the Pacific Coast
must go via the Southern Pacific from
Ogden to San Francisco George Nichol
son, representing the Santa Fe Railroad
at the meeting, said that the matter
would have to be submitted to the head
quarters of his company before he could
enter into any agreement that would bind
the Santa Fe people.
The representative of one of the largest
lines here stated emphatically to-night
that he believed the Santa Fe would see
its way clear to become a member of the
association. He said: ' "The Santa Fe
has a complete line from Chicago to San
Francisco and could handle the troops
without a break from Chicago to tide
water. The Government's order deprives
the Santa Fe not only of the through
haul, but even the haul over Its prairie
lines, and forces busines3 to which the
Santa Fe is 'entitled to go to the north
ern routes. Mr. Nicholson can therefore
not be blamed for claiming some restitu

SOUTH McALESTER, I. T., Sept 2.â
The Government census takers, who have
recently completed the official census of
the various Indian, tribes of the Indian
Territory, report a number of long-lived
people who reside in this section of the
country. It is claimed that the Indians
live to an older age than any other class
of people on earth. Many of them have
attained the age of 125 years, while a 100
year-old Indian is nothing out of the ordi
nary. Here are a few of them and some
facts about their lives.
White Horse, a medicine chief of the
Otoes, is now 101 years old, and says that
he feels as well as he did when he chased
cowboys and soldiers under Geronimo
fifty years ago. To prove his assertions
he is now planning a thousand-milo trip
across the eounlry to visit some of his
warrior friends. He Is a great medicine
man among the Otoes and Is their ambas
sador to the Great Spirit, where he makes
frequent trips, according to himself. He
also leads in the violent medicine dances
and takes medicine the same as he did
when a young chief.
Another aged Indian is Looking Glass,
a Cheyenne warrior. He Is 104 years old,
and will soon be 105. He was with Sitting
Bull, the great Sioux warrior, in most of
'his raids, and he has passed through
seven Indian wars. He Bays that he does
not remember how many white people he
has killed, but that it must be over 100.
His eyesight Is keen and his hearing la
excellent. He does hot speak the Eng
lish language.
Nancy Jacobs is a Choctaw woman, 100
years old, she lives near Antlers. She was
a cook for the white soldiers during the
civil war and remembers all the big gen
erals and commanders of the Southern
forces. She has a married daughter 65
years of age who lives near by. The old
woman has outlived three husbands and
still does her own cooking and housekeep
ing.
Among tho Apaches there are ten or
twelve old women who have passed the
100 mark. One of the cruel features of
the Apacho home life is that when a
woman has passed her period of useful
ness about the house she is taken into the
country and left by the roadside to die.
The white people have talked the Apaches
nearly out of this way of treatment to
the old people, but the custom Is still
practiced.

Peking. Mr. Adee, the. acting Secretary
of State, has decided for the present not
to make any Ftatement as to the names
of the powers which have answered, or
to indicate whether the replies are of an
affirmative or a negative character, on
the ground that the publication of the
nttitud<- of the powers might embarrass
the negotiations at this* t'.me. It is there
fore Impossible to Kara definitely to what
extent answers have been received. Tne
opinion i>revalls. however, that none of
a. conclusive character has as yet come
to hand, such communications as have
been received being merely of a prelim
inary character. In diplomatic circles
the opinion prevails that none of the
great powers have as yt-t reached a final
determination as to the course they will
pursue.
"Want Time to Communicate.
7t is recognized here that some of them
at least will want sufficiem time to per
mit communication with their diplomatic
and military representatives in China
with a view to determining the exact con
dltion of affairs from their own point of
view before undertaking to make any
reply to so Important a proposition as
that involved in the American memoran
dum.
Empress Ag-ain Moving.
Owing to the Interruption of telegraphic
communication between Peking and Tien
tsin it is believed here that sores days
may elapse before final answers are re
ceived. Officials are watching with Inter

dispatch received during the da;.-. The
latest word concerning U Huiir Chang's
whereabouts was contained in the Asso

stating that he was Ftill ther*. The r*Â»
pert that the foreigners there generally
discredited him was rÂ«=ad with interest in
diplomatic circles. The Fuspicion of his
motives then- seem to be shared by many
of the diplomats here.
An interesting bit of information re
garding the Empress Dowager came to
Washir.gton it: a roundabout way to-day.
It was to the <-ffeet that the British Gov
ernment had received word that the Em
pre?3 was going from Tyanfu, In the prov
ince of Shensl, to which place she had fled
after her escape from Peking, to Hslnan
fu. Tyanfu is, farther west than Eistnan

further away from the Chinese capital
The report says nothing of tho Emperor's
movements. It b; Fug-grsted as a possi
bility that ho may have 1r>ft Yt<r entour
age and that he may have decided to re
vr.zln where he is or to return to Peking.
His return to the- capital city would prob
ably completely change the situation. He
belonged to the ProgTe*p!ve party before
he was compelled <o fign the. imperial re
script of 18KS, and if restored to power
peace negotiations would undoubtedly be
facilitated. The powers would have more
confidence in him than in the reactionary
party. Despite the Empress' coup of two
years ago. diplomats here familiar with
â¢Chinese affairs pay the Chinese people
regard him as their rish'.ful ruler.

The Shanghai correspondent of the
Times, wiring yesterday, says: "Li Hung
Chang has received a telegram from the
Chinese. Minister in Berlin, asserting that
Germany is prepared to act in concert
with Russia with a view to a settlement,
and that therefore it is probable Germany
will foilow Russia and withdraw her
troops from Peking. Two American cor
respondents who left Peking' August 21
with a party of missionaries arrived here
yesterday. The British residents at the
time the Americans left were preparing
to proceed to Tientsin. Fighting had en
tirely ceased and hardly any Chinese were
met on route. An official telegram from
Ohinptu-Ku reports that Kwel Chun, vice
roy of Sze Chuan and th<i Tartar general
of Rze Chuan. have both been dismissed
by Imperial edict, showing that the Em

ALLEGED APPOINTMENT
OF A CHINESE REGENT
According to a dispatch from Tientsin,
dated August 25, to the Standard, an epi
demic of suicides has broken out among
the Chinese in Peking, where entire fami
lies are hanging themselves.
LOXDOX. Sept. 3, 4 a. m.â There Is no
confirmation of the report that the Chi
nese attacked the allies at Kangchung,
which is six miles south of Peking.
Various dispatches from Shanghai con
firm the reports of the failure of the rice
crop in the Nankin district and assert
that foreigners are being molested in
Nankin, the British Consul having been
insulted.
FOREIGNERS ARE BEING
MOLESTED IN NANKIN
Shanghai, has reported to the State De

the landing of marines by the Japanese
there was closed, and this presumably has
satisfied the officials here. The gunboat
Castine, dispatched to Amoy several days
since by the Navy Department, it is be
lieved, will not tarry there long. Her
destination was the Cavite Naval Station
In the Philippines, and the State Depart
ment, taking advantage of this knowl
edge, had orders given that she stop at
Amoy on the way down to report upon
conditions there.
Word was received at the Navy De
partment to-day that the battleship Ore
gon, which has just come out of a Jap
anese drydoek, where she has been un
dergoing repairs,' had sailed from Naga
saki for Wushung, the man-of-war an
chorage at Shanghai. The assignment to
that place Is supposed to have been made
by Admiral Remey, but the reason for
sending her there is not stated here. In
that vicinity, however, she will be of as
sistance in landing marines If for any
rcascn the necessity for this should arise.

many men of small mental caliber having
frequently attained great honors.
"Brothers, let us pause for a moment and
consider the result of this Bystem of train
ing. Just think of itâ men who have de
voted half a lifetime to this hermit-like
course of learning after they have suc
cessfully passed their examinations are
given responsible GoA'ernment positions.
How can they be competent to fill them?
A man who knows nothing but the "four
books" may in time be assigned to super
intend a modern arsenal. Would it not
be better to select a man who had spent
as many years in an iron foundry? One
of the first official acts of Emperor Kwang
Su was to abolish the old eight-legged ex
amination.
"I do not advocate robbing our people
of all the harmless superstitions, nor do I
believe in the destruction of the great
moral precepts of our philosophers. They

upon his audience was fairly, electrical, a
large number of men weeping like chil

"Do not weep, my brothers." he re
sumed. "Liberty and reform will soon be
ours. Then we will reverently lay aside
the relics of barbarism and begin life
anew. All will soon be changed and the
regeneration of China will follow. The

our country by an unwritten law, namely,
the right of might, arc nothing but Rus-

LEONG TAI KINN SHEDS TEARS
OVER THE WOES OF KWANG SU
Eloquent Address
Audience in Chi
nese Theater Is
Strongly Moved
by His Words.
LEONG KAT TINN, who claims to
be special ombassador of the de
posed Emperor of China, Kwangr
Su, delivered an impassioned ad
dress yesterday afternoon to a large audl
fnce of his countrymen in the Jackson
street Theater. Ills plea for the restora
tion of the Emperor and the moderniza
tion of China, pnd his depiction of the in
dignities that had been heaped upon the
unfortunate Kw&ng Su by the Dowager
Empress, were so eloquent that the j'ellow
men in the audience were moved to tears.
Seldom has any speaker been able so to
play upon the emotions of the stoical
Chinaman as he is known to America.
I^eonsr Kal Tinn arrived in San Francis
co last Monday, and his address yesterday
was the first he delivered here. lie came
to this country to gain the support of the
Chinese resident in the United States for
the restoration of the Emperor and the
inauguration of a liberal policy towara
foreigners. He Is the representative of the
Chinese Empire Association of Reform
ers, as well as the accredited agent ol
Kwang Su.
"O, brothers, I salute you," he began.
"Thousands of miles I have traveled to
deliver the last message of our beloveo.
Emperor, who for the first time in our
4000 years of history happens to be the
only ruler who has appealed to his people
for assistance. I come as one of his direct
agents to ask that you give heed to his
cry for help. This noble man who appeals
to you is the first honest, Emperor with
which the Creator has blessed China for
thousands ef years.
"For over 250 years we have been at the
mercy of a horde of Tartar politicians and
soldiers. We have bent the knee and
kowtowed to these heartless foreigners,
who have not one thought In common with
our people. Why have we done so? Sim
ply because of our love for the obsolete
maxims and ancient precepts of the great
philosophers of our native land â laws well
calculated to guide a man's moral charac
ter, but absolutely inadequate as govern
ing principles for a great nation.
"Let me say that during the last foul
years more has occurred for the edifica
tion of the Chinese people than in all of
the previous 4000 years of written history.
Patriots have been borri to our people who
have not feared to cry aloud their com
plaints to high heaven: men who have
sacrificed their all for the love of China
and our people; men who have even
snatched the buttons from their caps for
the cause of libertyâ and every Chinese
scholar knows what this means. It means
the casting aside of that which has cost
them a lifetime of study to attain: it
means the loss of a badge which insured
great or comparative luxury for the bal
ance of their lives. Every man who haj
attained rank under Chlna'8' educational
system deserves official position as a re
ward for his Industry, for it means long
years of study and a flawless memory;
estimate as to where the center of popu
lation will be located by this census.
The rtrÂ«=t census in 3700 located a center
of population twenty-three miles east of
Baltimore. It has since moved westward
ct a rate of about lifty mile.*, each decade,
almost on the thlrty-^nlnth parallel of latr
trade, until the censuw of lÂ«Â«0 located it
twenty miles east of Columbus, Ind.
I'nless there aro larger increases in the
rural population in the far West than are
now expected, it Is not probable that the
present census will locate the center of
population any farther west than that of
1S90, though it Is not improbable that it
will be shifted to the north. The present
indications are that it will bÂ° to the east
cf li'diaiiapolis and near that city. This
question of location of the center of pop
ulation and relative density of population
in different sections of the country has an
important he-Â»rinfr on the representation
In Congress under the new apportionment
that will bo made as a result of th!:s cen
sus.
Approximate Representation.
It Is apparent that the different sections
cf the country will have approximately
about the same representation as at pres
ent.
It can bo stated with reasonable cer
tainty that there will be r.o reduction in
the number of representative? from New
York. There may be even an increase of
one. The five New York cities already
counted show an aggregate Increase in
population of 1.0M.713. which Is more than
the Increase credited by the Porter cen
sus to the entire State between 1SS0 and
I89A. In the Southern States two cities
in Kentucky show a Rain of 24.26 per cent
ard one in Ixmislar.a 1S.62 per cent. San
Francisco, the only city counted yet on
the PiioiJlc Ccast. shows a gain of 14.64
per cent.
It is expected that the Increase In popu
lation in the rural districts har been
rather in the West than In the
East. i>ut it Is not believed it will bo
sufficient to offset the hiph rates of in
crease in the great cities from Chicago
Eastward.
Incidentally flgrures thus far available
throw a flood of lieht upon the methods
that were pursued by Mr. Porter In taking
the census of 1S90.
They leave little doubt that thÂ«Â» popula

HOTEL. WASHINGTON. Sept. 2.-
There has been no change in the
programme of me AVar Depart
ment In the matter of bringing j
home the volunteer troops now serving in j
the Philippines. The law under which j
the present volunteer army was ~nw?ted
provides that the men must be brought
home and discharged in the United States
before July 1, 1901. The War Department
is preparing to carry out this provision of
the law. The regular troops now being
sent to the Philippines are to replace the
volunteers.
In order, however, that Major General
MacArthur may have the greatest pos
sible force to carry on a vigorous cam
paign for a few weeks after the close of
the present rainy season, it is intended to
allow the volunteers to remain as long as
possible without Interfering with the
plan3 for discharging all of them before
July 1 of next year. This programme
was decided upon long before the begin
ning of the Chinese campaign and the sit
uation in that country has nothing to }
do with it. At the same time if the j
conditions should become such as to re
quire additional American troops in
China, they would probably be drawn
from the Philippines, just as the Ninth
and Fourteentn Infantry were sent up
for the Peking relief expedition. The au
thorities here have no idea, however, that
there will be any necessity for any Amer- j
lean reinforcements in China and they
nope that the vigorous campaign which
Major General MacArthur will be able to
carry on with his entire force of volun
teers and regulars will practically win'd
up the Philippine insurrection before the
volunteers are brought home. Unles it
is proposed to go to a great expense an-i
charter a large number of steamers.
Colonel Charles Bird, officer of the
Quartermaster's Department in charge of
sea. transportation, says it will De nces
aary to begin the shipment of men home
from the Philippines early in DecemDer.
"We calculate," ho continued, "upon
each of our transports making two trips,
BO the withdrawal mii3t commence before |
the tirst of the new year."
No orders have yet been Issued by the
department for the return of volunteers, j
but under the law such action must be
taken and if Congress authorizes the re- ]
tentlon of the volunteer army It wl.i be \
necessary to reorganize the regiments in j
the United States. Manila has always I
been looked upon by the authorities as an
excellent base for operations in the Far
Hast and supplies which may not be
needed at Taku will be diverted to Man', a,
where they will be stored In case of need.
Troubles of Commissioners.
MANILA. Sept. 2.â The Filipinos seem
incapable of realizing the scope and pur
pose of the legislative functions of the
commission of peace. There is no possi
bility of separating tho legislative from
the executive branches of the Government I
and therefore the commission's announce- j
ment of its assumption of power yester
day has met with childish comments at j
the hands of the Spaniards and foreign- j
ers who sneer at the new arrangement. ;
as they are apt to do at every beneficial i
innovation on the part of the United '
States authorities. The commisson enters
upon the governmental field under the i
following conditions:
A majority of the islanders desire peace j
and the resumption of busings under the
Americans, but they are so cowed by a
long series of murderous atrocities and
destruction of property by their armed
countrymen that they dare nut -actively
show their feelings, Especially because
experience has taught them that such an
expression of sentiment will bring upon
them from the mercilessly revengeful
rebels. A genuine reign of terror is ex
ercised by inscrgents and Ladroncs over
peaceful countryfolk in order to collect
the revenues and recruits the operations
require, and widespread vengeance is
wreaked in the vicinity of garrisoned
towns. For examplr, thÂ«Â» tn<nTiro^f <-â¢...

a number of rifles. The surrenders, al

Increase in Imports.
The experience of Northern Luzoa
shows that the American occupation of
any locality tends to Its pacification and
well-being. An unsettled American pol
icy retards the Investment of capital.
Nevertheless, the imports for the last
quarter and a half were greater than
during any period of the Spanish re
gime. No doubt the needs of the army
of occupation are responsible for a very

MYSTERY OF
MURDERS AT FOLSOM
Continued from First Page.
HUGH B. GILROT was a short time ago a business man of Petaluma. He
left that city to go to Nevada. He passed through Reno on the morning of
August 20, en route to "Winnemucca. He worked two days, when ho was
arrested and thrown into jail on the charge of insanity. Sheriff McDeid
of Humboldt County took the man to Reno on August 25 and committed
him to the asylum. Superintendent Patterson said the man was not insane,
but delirious and nearly dead from the effect of wounds. Everything possible
was done at the asylum to save the man's life, but the efforts proved futile.
An autopsy showed that Gilroy died from a bloo dclot on the brain produced
by a blow upon the head by some blunt instrument. The body was covered with
bruises and discolorations, showing evidences of murder.

By F. E. Mulholland.
SACRAMENTO. Sept. 2.â The Sacramen
to State Fair will open to-morrow, ana
the prospects for its success are more pro
nounced than in many years past.
The opening of the pavilion to-morrow
night Is to be one of the most brilliant in
cidents in Sacramento's history. The
women of Sacramento have bestirred
themselves in behalf of the event and
have perfected arrangements for the pres
ence of all the social clubs and organiza
tions of women. This means the guarantee
of several thousand persons at the outset,
that the fair shall open with vim and
flourish, and It also means that the ex
hibitors will not waste a minute's time in
the preparation and completion of their
booths and show of manufactures and
wares.
Meetings of thf residents of Oak Park
are being held nightly for the purpose of
arranging for Oak Park day at the races
and Oak Park night at the pavilion next
week. It is the intention to purchase a.
solid block of 1000 admission tickets in or
der to accommodate those patriotic sub
urbanites.
While all these preparations are in
progress for the pavilion opening, while
Secretary Peter J. Shields is furrowing his
brow in the ceaseless endeavor tr> accom
modate exhibitors with space when it is
all spoken for, it must not be thought that
the racecourse at the far famed Agricul
tural Park is teing overlooked. On the
contrary, it is the intention to make the
first <lay one of the most notable of the
two weeks' season. On that day the Occi
dent stake, one of the classics in the an
nals of racing in the West, will be con
tested for. The stake is one of the richest
offered the light-harness contingent on
the Pacific Coast. It la confidently believed
from a consideration of the entries that
the winner will have a record not fai
from 2:12. Eulah Mac. one of the entries,
has a record, made at Santa Kosa early
this spring, of 2:19'Â«, but it is declareo.
that she has frequently done halves in
1:04. Tom Smith, another entry, recently
made a mile easily in 2:18, with speed ana
wind in plenty left. The Roman turner

Vendome, the fourth racer, has a tine
pedigree, being a grandson of Palo Alto
(2:0SVi.) and Guy Wilkes (2:15Vi). This
event will, it in believed, draw an im
mense throng to the racetrack to-morrow.
The livestock and poultry exhibits,
which are rapidly being put in shape, will
be far better this year than ever before.
Belgian hare and poultry fanciers will
have fine representation, while the dog
show promises to be great in the number
and quality of the display.
The pony race for tiie Prince Poniatow
ski championship cup will be a big af
fair. Several thousands of dollars have
been raised by citizens to enable the Sac

on the nights of the fair.

VICTORIA, B. C, Sept. 2.â The Japan
ese warship Mushashl llaru, which went
around the Kuril Islands in search of the
sealer Hinode Maru, has returned to
Otaru, says the Hakodate correspondent
of the Japan Advertiser, without having
found a trace of the lost vessel or of any
survivors. All hope for the vessel and
that some survivors managed to reach
the islands and winter there, which
impelled the Japanese Government to send
the vessel on her mission of mercy, has
been given up.
The Hinode Maru failed to return with
the other vessels of the Japanese sealing
lleet this spring from her winter's cruise,
and no report was heard of her since Oc
tober u, when she was spoken oft Pera
mushir. It was concluded that she had
been lost in one of the winter gales.
Although the sailors of the vessel were
Japanese, she carried a number of for
eigners in her crew, one of -vyhom, a hunt
er, hailed from San Francisco. He was
Joseph Williams, and was \%ell known to
coast sealing men. Other whites lost on
the vessel were Captain W. J. Wilson of
Scotland and Andrew and Joseph Gon
zales, former British Columbia sealers,
iiut for years residents of the Bonin Isl

The principal dark spot on the tinajicial
horizon is the possibility of a big Rus
sian loan contractt-d in France. It is
known that Russia needs something like
Â£40.000.000 to complete the Trans-Siberian
Iiaiiroad, the necessity of which has been
demonstrated during the Chinese crisis.
It Is argued ;hu.t If the Russian Minister
of Finance, M. de Wette. gets the loan, in
addition to supplying Russia â¢with the
sinews of war In case she should be dis
posed to break the peace, the large
amount secured would enable M. de Witte
to recommence his aummaniac policy of
hoarding gold, thus disturbing the money
markets of the world. On the whole,
however, the week was a good one, prices
improving, although consols lost half a
point.
LONDON. Sept. 2.â The Stock Ex
change was more cheerful last week, ow
ing to the end of the Ta ft' vale railroad
strike, to the. belief that the war in South
Africa is drawing rapidly to a close and
to the probability of the withdrawal of
the allies from Peklr.K. Kusiness, however,
Bhows no signs of revival, although those
who fancy themselves well informed ar
gue that there must be large sums await
ing investment which cannot be held much
longer, and that a boom will soon come,
a feature of which will be the rise of con
sols and other gilt-edged securities.
Dutch and Belgian seaports are now out
stripping the German in the matter of
tonnage. Arrivals at Bremen have in
creased 11 per cent since 1894. and at Ham
burg 24 pÂ«r cent, while the increase at
Antwerp has been 3<J j>er cent: at Amster
dam 41 per cent and at Rotterdam 56 per

The Koersen Zeitung remarks: "The
German demand must liepenu upon Amer
ican coal fur the m-xt few months."
Tne situation of the iron market is
somewhat improved. The sheet mills of
Westphalia report increased orders. Ger
many's pigiron production for July was
fis?,7T3 tons, against 6S5.4S4 lor the previous
month.
Tha coal scarcity continues, ajui is much
discussed. An advance of 1 mark per ton
ha* betn made in Silesia. The burning
of peat has begun In Berlin on a
large i-cale. The proposed reduction of
railway freights on Imported coal, as the
papers iÂ»oini out, cannot attract English
coal, owing to its dearness; but will leave
tlie lield open f<;r American coal. The Ber
lin Tagebl&tt says:
"It would be singular if the enterpris
ing Americans should let the present fa
vorable opportunity pass without a pow
erful effort to Increase the coal export."
This improvement in the Boerse was as
sisted by an unusually easy money mar
ket during the monthly settlement. Con
trary to all experiences, rates weakened
during the settlement. The financial
press, contrasting the present situation
with that of last year, when the autumn
demands had already made themselves
strongly felt, predicted that conditions
will remain much more favorable than
they were a year ago. Government funds

BERLIN. Sept. 2.-Last week the Boerse
showed a decided improvement. Interest
was centered chiefly upon industrials, and
particularly upon coal shares, of which
the standard lines showed gains of from
S to 12 points. Iron shares also advanced
upon the reports of a continued improve
ment in the iron trade.

PERSONAL MENTION.
Some ugly stories of undue severity and
evident favoritism comes from the Brit
ish scuadron in the Mediterranean. A
17-year-old hoy on the cruiser Diadem was
hauled up for swearing at the ship's cor
poral, and after having been kept a pris
oner for several days was sentenced to
receive twenty-four strokes with a birch.
The punishment was so severe as to bad
ly mutilate him. and the boy was in a
fainting condition when cast loose. The
crew considered the boy as being light
headed and hardly responsible for his
acts. A second incident was on the cruis
er Flora, where a marine was sentenced
to two years' hard labor for striking a
sergeant. The latter a short time after
kicked and abused a private, for which

One manager of an important firm of manufactur
ers declared men will not accept the .waist because it
is*too feminine in appearance. lie also stated a fact
which may show why the factories will not encourage
the trade. He is quoted as saying: "A man does
not want to wear a garment that will make him look
at nil feminine and certainly some of the waists seen
recently give that appearance. Furthermore, these
waists would be .very hard to fit. I took the measure
of a number of men recently and it would be sur
prising to note the great difference there was in the
length from the shoulders to their waists. We would
be receiving complaints constantly about misfits, etc.,
for which we would not be at all responsible. A
woman would take the trouble to have her. shirt waist
altered, but men want to buy something they can \vear
and would not go to all this bother. It can be readily
The reasons given for doubting the general accept
ance of the shirt waist are numerous. A good many
of the manufacturers hold that the new garment is too
revolutionary and that men will never take kindly to
it. Men will wear coats, they argue, from custom and
conventionality and only those who arc always look
ing for novelties and fads will venture upon the inno
vation. Others maintain that even if men decide
to discard the coat during the hot weather of mid
summer they will prefer the shirt to the shirt waist.
One of them asked: "How many men will wear a
tucked or plaited waist through the streets of New
York?" and he answered his question himself by
saying, "There may be a few ultra-swell men and
sports who will order a few from the custom shirt
makcrs and they may also sell in very cheap goods,
but otherwise there will be no demand for them."
The Commercial has canvassed the leading manu
facturers of shirts and has found that all of them will
have shirt waists for men among their samples for
spring goods next season, but most of them believe
the demand will not be large and that the trade will
not amount to much. One of them is quoted as say
ir.g: "If the trade wants shirt waists we will furnish
them. Most of the firms are making up samples and
will send them out as an experiment, but no one will
make up any large stock in advance of orders. It
may be a fad that will take and it may not."
IH^ ROM the New York Commercial it is learneo
that the proposal to adopt shirt waists as a part
of male attire during the summer has aroused po
much interest that every shirt manufacturer in that
city is overwhelmed with letters asking for informa
tion about the new style of garment. The letters, it
is said, come not only from large cities and summer
r(forts r but from the smallest villages and places sup
posed to be unaffected by the passing fads of fashion.
Thus it appears the whole Eastern part of the country
hns been interested in the new movement.
THE SHIRT WAIST TR0DE.
When better facilities for transportation are pro
vided there will be an immense market for fresh Cali
fornia fruit in all the British cities. Even now the
trade is an increasing one and it will be seen from
the report we have quoted that California fruit is the
favorite. We have established the brand and it carries
the trade. By and by we may establish a similar de
mand for California wine. London will not be afraid
to take it up simply because it lacks a French label.
Thus the severely hot season may be working out a
benefit for us in more ways than one. Season after
season let us hope the Cockney vender may have occa
sion to cry, as the Gazette reports him: '"Ere y'are,
r.oble marquis, Californy cherries, a penny a bag,
enough for to squench y'r noble thrist an' leave some
good 'tins still for the little marquizzics at 'ome. Sold
again, an' got the money."
It is to be hoped that, having been started on a fruit
diet by the hot weather, the good folks of London will
stick to it with a true British pertinacity. We say this
not only in the interest of fruit producers, but of con
sumers. It is gratifying, moreover, to learn that the
favorite fruit goes by the name of "California cherry."
Ii is to be doubted, however, whether the genuine
California dainty can be sold there at tuppence "a 'art
pahnd" by even the most enterprising street vender,
but that is a side issue. The good citizen is benefit
ing London and advertising California fruit at the
same time and both of those things arc commend
able.
Â¥ ONDON has met the extraordinary heat of the
j summer by taking to fruit-eating on a scale
â * never before known. The Westminster Gazette,
in describing the rush of people in the city for the
fruit stalls during the hot days, says: "Icecream has
lost its vogue somewhat, owing to suspicions of bacilli
in the eggs, and so in the blaze the hot man's fancy
lightly turns to William pears. Ludgate Hill, the
center of the city's peripatetic trade, has become an
orchard of early apples and glossy plums, while the
l.-itest delicacy is "California^ cherries, gents and lidios,
just the very sime as y! p'ys two bob a pahnd for in
Coyin Garden â 'ere tuppence a 'arf pahnd, me Lord.'
And when the thirsty passerby lingers, doubting the
propriety of buying in such style, he is encouraged by
the kindly assistant, who remarks, 'I'll put 'em in
r.cwspipcr for y', captain, an' you kin stow 'cm in y'r
'at.' "

The local markets exhibit few features worthy of

fully up to expectations. Price fluctuations are few

are quieter, but. for the satisfactory reason that most
of the choice fruit has been already sold and the de
mand for lower grade goods is never very sharp, ex

prices for dried and canned fruits later on is general
and holders are therefore not pressing the market.

Ehous the grounds for this rather sweeping statement.
They are as follow?: Mexican Government. $25,000,
000 ct 5 per cent; Russian Government. $10,000,000 at
4 per cent: English Government â (think of it!) â
S_S'.fXK).ooo at 3 l /i per cent; city of Montreal. $3,000,

000 at 4 per cent. These loans aggregate $76,000,000,
to say r.nthing of the large gold loans made to
French 3nd German banks for private account. In
this connection Henry Clews, the well-known New
York financier, says: '"We have witnessed a most
extraordinary development in our foreign trade,
chiefly because we are now able to manufacture for
the world's markets; and. finally, we find ourselves
lenders of money to nations in all parts of the world

had the courage to predict such things would have
been considered a fit candidate for the lunatic asylum;

Wall street continues dull. The public still hold;
aloof and the professionals arc apathetic. Prices for
the leading stocks run along from day to day without
much change. The most interesting feature in the
monÂ» y market for some time is the appearance of
Sweden as a borrower of $10,000,000 on her 4 per
cent bonds. This is still another indication that the
United States is becoming the money lender of the
v ;ir!d and that it is slowly but surely driving Eng

banker says: "The United States has become the
' credit nation of the world. She is not surpplanting
England â she has already done so."
WHILE the bank clearings and failures of the
country did not make a very favorable showing
last week, the former falling oft 2i.8per cent from
last year and the latter numbering 165 against 131 last

the distributive trade :n many lines, such a? dry good-;,
clothing, shoes, hats, hardware, iron and steel. The
latter line continues more or less irregular. Some
producers are so anxious to book orders ahead that
they are accepting low prices, while others, more
sanguine of the future, are refusing to take orders,
claiming that present prices are too low and that they
will advance before long. Some iron centers report
increasing business at hardening quotation?, while in
other districts mills are closing down. The general
export demand for iron and steel, however, continues
good Cotton and wool are quieter and weak, with
manufacturers buying only to satisfy immediate wants.
Otherwise the merchandise markets are devoid of

WE ARE FLOURISHING
These papers fairly represent the prevailing opinion
of the Democracy of the South. If now Bryan should
be elected what could he accomplish in the face of a
Congress controlled by Democrats, a majority of
whom would be from the South. Any intelligent man
studying the situation will perceive that the whole
Bryanite campaign is a farce and that it can mean only
disturbance to' the industries of the country- The
leaders of his party agree upon nothing and anything
like a definite policy of action in office would be im
possible.
"The South in the present Presidential campaign
is running contrary to its every practical interest for
the sake of tradition and a party name. There is
nothing in Mr. Bryan's policy which commends itself
to Southern wisdom and far-sightedness. Should the
South look well to its own future it would take a pro
gressive view instead of clinging to political memor
ies of the moldered past and tying itself to hurtful
policies for the sake of a mistaken temporary expedi
ency which not only ignores the best interests of so
gr-cat a section, but also goes counter to the best prin
ciples and traditions cf the party in whose name the
incongruous elements of Bryanism are working."
Such expressions are emphatic enough, but after all
they do not strike the nail fairly on the head. The
statement of the Constitution is but an evasion of the
irsue. That of the Commercial-Appeal casts scorn
upon the Democratic platform, but stops at the can
didate. The Nashville American has the courage to
tarry the argument of the South to its logical con
clusion. It says:
The Chattanooga Times takes a similar view of the
issue. It says, "The country has these islands on its
hands to have nnd to hold," and that it "will aid no
party in efforts to embarrass the Government in man
aging them for the best interests, first of the Union
and second of the islands and peoples." The Mem
phis Commercial- Appeal says: "There is no such
thing as imperialism contemplated by any party.
Legitimate and necessary expansion is an accom
plished fact; "talk of imperialism is arrant nonsense,
r.nd nonsense cannot be made a paramount issue any
more than an elephant can be made an eel by writing
on its trunk, 'This is an eel.' Tennessee's coal, iron
and cotton must find p market in the Orient and the
people should be educated up to the point where they
can see the utility aÂ«d benefits of expansion."
Not long ago the Atlanta Constitution said: "As
we have pointed out in these columns, time and time
again, it is preposterous to suppose that any sensible
Democrat ever entertained the idea that the United
States could afford to shirk the responsibilities thrust
upon them by the fortunes of war. In matters of
such large import as the occupation of these- islands
by the Americans, we do not believe in accident. The
event is providential in its nature; it means some
thing more important than the wisest man can now
foresee. Whatever it may mean, it certainly did not
and does not mean that we are to turn these people
over to their own untrained and undisciplined political
desires, or to become the prey of European rapacity."
DOWN South the Democrats are taking Bryan's
anti-imperial issue as a bitter medicine. More
over, they arc protesting, even while swallow
ing, that in their judgment it will not be wholesome.
Some of them vow it is not Democratic at all and a
goodly host of them ridicule the whole thing.

Tlie workingmen will not fail to note, moreover,
that the increase of wages has come in gold and not
in a depreciated currency. It represents an advance
in positive welfare. Furthermore, there has been .1
notable growth in th^ strength of the unions, meas
ured by membership. The American Federation of
Lrbor reports a gain in enrollment in 1899 of 225,000
and all the affiliated organizations have increased, as
is evidenced by the number of charters issued during
the year.
Thus the wbrkingman of the United States find?
himself to-day a more prosperous and a more potent
factor in the nation than ever before'.' This is a work
irgrnan's country and a workingrnan's age. The ob
servance of the day will be shared by the people gen
erally, for in this republic distinctions of the people
into classes are made for statistical purposes only; they
do not affect the social organization in any respect.
Labor day is for all Americans and to-day all will
celebrate it with pri-ie and gratification in the pros
perity and strength of the workers in the shops and
fields and mines.
It is not, however, by such indirect methods that
we find the strongest evidences of the augmented
prosperity of workingmen. The records of the labor
unions bear the most impressive testimony to the ad
vance in wages among workingmen and to their in
creased ability to support and sustain co-operative
rssociation?. Reports of national and international
unions, made in April of this year, showing the per
cent of increase in wages of different trades in 1897,
1 80S and 1899, attest the benefits that have come to
labor direct. Among these reports it may be noted
that for the year iSo'3 the increase in wages of im
portant trades was: Bricklayers and stonemasons, 25
per cent; boiler-makers and iron-ship buildcrs,*25 per
cent: blacksmiths, 10 per cent; brewery workmen, 15
per cent: bookbinders, 25 per cent: boot and shoe
workers. 15 per cent: carpenters, 15 per cent; cigar
makers, 10 per cent; locomotive engineers, 30 per
cent; electrical workers, 25 per cent: iron, steel and
tin workers. 17 per cent; leather workers, 15 pel
cent: meat-cutters and butchers, 25 per cent, ma
ch'nists, 40 per cent: miners. 40 per* cent; paper
maker?, 10 per cent: cotton-spinner?, 12 per cent:
seamen, 3,?. per cent; railroad laborers, 10 per cent:
wood-workers. 15 per tent. It is not worth while to
gc over the whole list. Suffice it to say that not less
than fifty-six of the largest trades in the country
report an increase of wages in 1S99 whose percentages
vary from 3 per cent in the case of glass-workers to
300 per cent in the case of stage employes.
present activity of all lines of industry labor has
found ample opportunities for work and better wagc3
than ever before. Commerce, expanding over every
>ea and in all quarters of the globe, has found new
markets for the products of labor. Finance has been
strengthened by labor's thrift and reports of savings
banks in all parts of the country reveal how large
have been surplus earnings of those who work for
wages:
Evidences of the increasing prosperity of workingmen
can be found in every official report of the industries,
the commerce or the finances of the country. In the
WHEN the workingmen of the United States
take note to-day of the conditions of labor in
this country at this time in comparison with
conditions that prevail elsewhere, or that prevailed
here four years ago, they will find ample reason to
ir.akc the celebration of the day a festival of triumph
and rejoicing. Every class of the American people has
advanced upward and onward since the panic years that
followed 1893. but among the individuals of no class
have the benefits of prosperity been more equally and
more universally divided than among workingmen.
THE ADVANCEMENT OF LABOR.
If the manufacturers do not wish to make them and
men do not wish to wear them it would seem that
the spring samples sent out will serve hardly any pur
pose beyond that of decorating shop windows. It
is worth noting, however, that the same issue of the
Commercial containing the interviews on this sub
ject published also a iociety item to the effect that a
shirt-waist hop had been given at the Belvedere
Hotel at Larchmont ai-d was attended by upward of
200 summer residents and yachtsmen. So whether
the shirt waist has a future or not, it is evidently en
joying a season of glory this year.
seen, therefore, that shirt waists are not the coming
style for men."

They left the almshouse hand in hand,
determined to flnd work, to be married

Clara, who had become an Inmate a few
days previous.
Clara was employed in the kitchen and
used to pay especial attention to the. old,
almost blind man. thereby earning his
gratitude and ultimately his love. Clara's
pity for the old man also developed into
love and about three months ago they
decided to leave the Almshouse and link
their fates after they had secured employ

following day. He obtained a situation

They met occasionally and a week ago
Paul suggested that she should tako a
room in the Mint lodging-house, so that
she' could be near him. She did so. and
they began to speculate on when they
could get married. He was earning $3 per
week and his board and she made between
$5 and $6 per week. Saturday night she
was suffering intensely and went to his
room for sympathy. She was so fagged
out that she fell asleep in a chair and he
did not like to disturb her. While retiring
he accidentally turned on the gas.
Yesterday morning a strong odor of gas
was discovered coming from his room, and
when the door was forced open they were
found both unconsciousâ she in the chair,

A small riot occurred on Kearny street
last evening, in which a mob of hoodlums
attacked police officers who were doing
their duty. Chief Sullivan, who witnessed
the aftair, announced that extra patrol
men would be placed on Barbary Coast
to preserve the peace in future.
For some time past gangs of the hood
lum element from North Beach and the
Mission have annoyed pedestrians passing
along the street. Women have been In
sulted and men molested. Last night a
crowd congregated on the corner of Wash
ington and Kearny streets and created a
disturbance. Special Officer Sam Dappett
snd Officer James Cavanaugh interfered,
and when an arrest was made by the first
named policeman, a number of the prison
er's pals attempted to rescue him.
The excitement v;as at its highest when
Chief of Police Sullivan put ir. an appear

trouble was explained to him and he was
informed as to the character of the per

The Very Rev. Walter McDonald, D. D.,
prefect of the Dnnboyne establishment,
Maynooth College, Ireland, preached the
sermon at St. Peter's Church yesterday
morning".
"Go, Show Yourselves to the Priest,"
was the text he selected, taken from the
gospel of the day. "According to the Jew
ish law,"' he said, "whenever a person
became minted with leprosy or suspicion
fell on him he was separated from his
fellow men and was not allowed to mingle
with them until he was examined and
reported free from the disease by the
priests. Now the Holy Fathers figura
tively used tins in reference to mortal sin.
and "this examination and certificate of
the priests are types of confession and ab
solution In the sacrament of penance. Ac
cordingly it is on certain aspects of this
sacrament I am about to speak.
"To be able to remit sin. as well as to
place the body and blood of Christ on the
altar under tne appearance of bread are
Halms that form the distinguishing fea
ture? of the priesthood of the Catholic
church No claim is so forcibly resisted
bv the enemies of our religion. Sacerdot
alism is In their eyes at once the stron - K
est and meanest of tyrannies, based. a 3
thev "ay. on craft and fraud Appealing,
as ihev'sav, to low mental fears and su
perstitions.' sacerdotalism is centered in
the altar and the confessional. They do
not seem to think argument necessary to
prove their charges. They call "sacer
dotallum and priestcraft, and that is
not appeal to Catholics whether
vou were ever asked for money as a price
Of absolution, or whether you would think
of offering a priest a fee to sin again. Is
i- not true that the priests of our church
get less for their services than the min
isters of any other church? The teacher
of any science or the members of any
other profession are far better paid than a
prleFt. It is easier to accumulate wealth
by attacking priests than by defending
religious principles. Let me remind you
nf a great moral lesson. Kach or us
should borrow from the gospel of to-day
a lesson of gratitude to God for all hi?

EACH SHOULD
BORROW LESSON
OF GRATITUDE
So Declares J. Sloat Fassett
of the Great Empire
State.
J. Sloat Fassett, who was candidate for
Governor of Is'ew York on the Republican
ticket, opposing Roswell P. Flower, Is at
the Palace on his annual trip to the coast.
Mr. Fassett has some very pronounced
ideas concerning the political situation
that should be of particular interest to the
voters of California.
"So far as New York is concerned," said
tie, "there need be no apprehension among
Republicans as to the tinal result. I look
for a good plurality for McKlnley ana
Roosevelt, also for the election of a Re
publican Governor and both houses of the
Legislature. The Republican candidate
will doubtless be B. B. Odell, who has for
years been chairman of the State Central
Committee. Republicans of our State do
not expect to win out with such a great
margin as that of 1S06, but with sufficient
to convince Mr. Bryan that his scheme is
not taken seriously by sensible people.
"Speaking of a possible reduction of plu
rality, I do not desire to convey the idea
that the Republicans have lost confidence
in McKinley, but that the laboring man
is no longer idle and hungry, as he was
in 1S96 but he has his comforts and will
not take the active interest In the cam
paign that he did when his stomach was
empty and he knew not where to find the
food to 1111 it and feed his family. The
laboring man with the full dinner pail
naturally becomes careless and stops
thinking why it is that he has plenty of
work at good wages.
"New iork City will not give Bryan
anything like the plurality he is promislnt;
himself. I would be surprised if he gets
more than 25,000 plurality in the city, and
the country will send down a vote that
will bury the gentleman from Nebraska
very deep. The fact of the matter ia that
the people of my State do not want a
change of administration. They have tried
the experiment before v/lth painful results
and do not wish to repeat it.
"Throughout the entire State the Demo
crats who voted secretly for McKinley In
'16 are coming out openly and declar
ing their Intention to support him in this
campaign. Furthermore, tncy are giving
good reasons for their defection from the
Democratic ranks. Their explanation is
that they are enjoying exceptionally pros
perous time3 and have been during the
past three years, and that they do not
propose to vote for a change on this par
ticular occasion. Here is the object les
son: In New York State deposits in the
savings banks have increased amazingly,
while small mortgages have largely de
creased. It would certainly be entirely
unreasonable for any man who under
stands the situation to ask for better con
ditions than now prevail.
"Any man who would have predicted
four years ago the splendid financial and
Industrial power that the United States
now enjoys would have been considered
presumptuous. In the Middle West and tno
Pacific Coast there are enormous activi
ties, and these sections of the country
that have so long remained dormant have
awakened to a new life. "We are building
up a splendid trade with all the countries
that border on the Pacific, but as a matter
of fact the development of this trade,
large as it is, has hardly begun. If the
balance of trade determines how a man
should vote, there should be no question
of the proposition that hÂ© should cast his
ballot for McKinley and prosperity.
"As for States like Ohio and Iowa, there
5s no concern with reference to the out
comes. These States with many others will
do their duty, and it is expected of every
citizen, of whatever politics, to get out
and put in his vote. If the Republican
workman, who now ha* a full dinner-pail,
after the years of privation under tho
Cleveland administration, will tako tho
proper interest in the campaign and vote
as common sense and experience teach
him. McKlr.lcy will be the next President
with a good healthy majority. w e can
not have too many votes, and that Is the
only way to go into the campaign."
Mr. Fas3ett will leave for New York in
a few days and in October will take the
stump for tha Republican party.
NEW YORK WILL
TEACH MR. BRYAN
A GOOD LESSON
The Thomas went on the Hunters Point
drydock yesterday. She was taken up by
the tugs Relief and Reliance. Her place
at Folsom-street wharf was taken by the
transport Rosecrans. while the Westmin
ster docked on the northerly side of the
wharf. The Roseeran3 sails to-day with
the men of two light batteries for Xaga
saki. They were originally ordered to go
by way of Honolulu, but the changed con
dition In China has necessitated a change
in the destination of the light batteries.
They may go to China, and they may
not. At Nagasaki they may be diverted
to Manila.
The German bark J. C. Pfiuger docked
at Howard-street wharf yesterday. The
vessel left here several months apo for
Liverpool with a cargo of wheat, but was
dismasted off shore and drifted into Santa
Barbara. The main and inizzen masts
went close to the deck, but. stranjje to
say, the foremost still stands. The Pflu
ger was towed back to San Francisco and
abandoned to the underwriters. She was
taken lo Port Costa, where her cargo was
discharged, and she has now come back
to San Francisco to be Hold to the highest
bidder. All kinds of stories are circu
lating .-yound the water front about the
Pfiuser. Nearly all her provisions and
supplies were removed before the vessel
went to Port Costa, and there was much
hilarity aboard before the vessel sailed
from here for Liverpool. Some of the cel
ebrants had to be brought ashore on the
tugr that towed the Pfluger to sea. The
Insurance companies are holding a quiet
investigation.
The steamer Samfla will dock to-day and
the work qt setting her ready for the
transportation of horses to the Orient will
l>e<?in at once. The Samoa is under char
ter to the German Government and is the
largest tramp that has come here outside
of the Algoa. She will be tttted up to car
ry 732 horses, and will pet away for the
seat of war in China inside of two weeks.

THERE is need of an enlightened and forceful public sentiment
on the subject of the so-called "French restaurants." It is dif
ficult to control these resorts of infamy by law, but there should
be no mistake in the public mind concerning' their character, which
is ordinarily of the lowest type, and no reputable man or woman
should be found within their doors for any ordinary purpose. Let
them be branded as the houses of shame that they are, and their
number will diminish and their character improve. There may also
be devised some sort of legal supervision to make this nefarious
business a difficult one. This might' be partially accomplished by
requiring ths correct registration in an accessible public book of all
guests requiring private apartments, and making falsity or neglect
in this respect punishable by exposure and in other ways. â Extract
from the lecture delivered last night by the Rev. B. Fay Mills.
as the houses of shame that they are, and
their number will diminish and their char
acter improve. There may also be devised
somo sort of legal supervision to make
this nefarious business a diflioult one. This
might be partially accomplished by re
quiring the correct registration in an ac
cessible public- book of all guests requiring
private apartments, and making falsity or
neglect in this respect punishable by ex
posure and in other ways.
Referring to the gambling and pool
room evil he said:
"The fight against poolrooms now being
made by the police department is an ex
ceedingly healthy sign of the times and
should have the hearty support of all
good citizens. We need stronger laws and
a more vigorous public sentiment In this
respect.
'â¢Faro game? and some other forms of
gambling seem to be divided even, but
other forms of gambling are openly tol
erated in the most conspicuous places.
Private Rambling it is impossible to sup
press, but the conspicuous playing of
poker for gambling purposes and some
other gamos in the most public places
la an inexcusable disgrace to a civilized
city. It is a relic of .^cmi-barbarlc times."
Coming to the subject of the press Mr.
Mills said that several of his correspond
ents had words of censure for the press.
He said that in Ills opinion the San Fran
cisco papers are unsurpassed in enterprise
and good judgment in selecting news of
interest and general attractiveness. He
deplored the publication of salacious news
with exaggeration placed upon the quar
rels of citizens rather than their noble
friendships. Continuing, he said:
"The editors and reporters, the owners,
publishers and managers, are, in their
private lives, among our most reputable
citizens. I appeal to these "Builders of
Public Opinion' to be leaders in the up
building of a better San Francisco. Let
all San Franciscans cease to magnify the
evils and emphasize the good of the city.
Let us cease making a show of the slums
by abolishing them and attract a high
class of residents rather than send many
of our best blood to strengthen the cities
of the East. Let us raise the old stand
ard flnrl establish new nnps "
Â«â ijâsHK Morals of San Francisco" was
J| the subject of the regular Sunday
j^ evening leotr.re delivered by % Rev.
Benjamin Fay Mills under* the
auspices of the Ethical Institute at Met
ropolitan Temple last night. Rev. Mr.
Mill? explained that his remarks were
based on his personal observations In San
Francisco, on interviews with prominent
citizens and replies received to questions
addressed to leading editors, judges, city
officials, attorneys, business men and oth
ers. In his lecture Rev. Mr. Mills de
nounced in scathiner language the French
restaurants and the immoral influences
he claimed they exerted. He declared
San Francisco's moral standard was
steadily beins raised and expressed hope
for the future. lie said in part:
"I find a general consensus ur" opinion
that San Francisco will average well in
comparison with other cities in the mat
ter of personal morality. The drinkinR
habits? of the people are more marked than
in many other American cities, especial
ly among the women. The standard and
practice of domestic morality U relative
ly low and yet is steadily being raised]
There has bc-ori marvelous progress in
the control of the 'social evil.' The worst
divo- have been obliterated and a flagrant
furm of temptation peculiar to San Fran
cisco Is now almost extinct. There is a
hiffh comparative standard in the moral
character of theatrical displays. Side en
trances of disreputable resorts have been
closed. Minors are conspicuous by their
absence from the most immoral portions
of the city."
The speaker then paid his respects to
the French restaurants in the following
language:
â¢â¢There is need of an enlightened and
forceful public sentiment on the subject
of the so-called 'French restaurants.' It
is difficult to control these resorts of in
famy by law, but there should be no mis
take in the public mind concerning their
character, which is ordinarily of the low
est type, and no reputable man or woman
should be found within their doors for any
nrdinarv nurnose. .Let them be branded

ONE MINISTER SCORES MODERN SOCIETY,

Rev. A. C. Baee Declares That
People of Upper Teiadom Are
Amardhflsts of God's KiegdoiiH
spirit of modern society which voices itself in the phrase
JL "I have a right to spend Sunday as I please" is a dangerous
spirit. It is the spirit which caused the initial sin in the Gar
den of Eden; it is a spirit which would wreck any government exist
in twenty-four hours. You have no right to do as you please on
the Sabbath. No citizen can break the laws on the statute book;
no citizen willfully, knowingly would do such a thing; none
but anarchists or criminals, and for them the jail doors yawn black
and terrible.
Modern society people are the anarchists of the kingdom of
God. I could make you tremble at the picture I might draw of
the terrible conditions prevalent among society. Many who con
demn work on the Sabbath commend revels on that day. Do you
not realize that ons man's pleasure means another man's work? I
am pained to observe the stand that many prominent clergymen of
this city have taken in this matter of Sabbath breaking. The city
ministers are dodging the question. â Extract from sermon delivered
last night by the Rev. A. C. Bane.
CALIFORNIA - STREET METHO
DIST EPISCOPAL, CHURCH was
last night for the second time the
scene of a scathing excoriation of.
the local smart set by the Rev. A. C. Bane,
whose golf sermon a week ago
turned the calcium of public attention full
upon him. The discourse on the Scotch
pamo, which is all the go among the 400
at gay Del Monte raised a very
storm of criticism and disapprov
al, voiced both in the falsetto of
the debutante and (here Is what Mr.
Bane characterizes as "abominable") in
the tones of Catholic and Episco
palian priests. Last night, while the golf
stlck Sabbath-breaker came in for his
1 share, he nearly escaped in the general
denunciation of local society and its
queer ways which the Rev. Mr. Bane in
1 dulged in for an hour and ten minutes.
"Remember the Sabbath day to keep It
holy" was tne text on which this discourse
was based, and the speaker pointed out
several ways in which this commandment
.was generously and frequently shattered.
The Bpeaker also took occasion to refute
the various criticisms, anything but
friendly, which had bren aimed at both
himself ar.<l his views in a manner which
would either show that the "40O" is as
I bad as the Rev. Mr. Bane says It is, or
I else that its members are leaving the
church ior athletics. The Rev. Mr. Bane
spoke in part as follows:
' "I abhor sensationalism. I am not here
to condemn golf, but to defend God's law.
I have been called 'narrow' on account of
my views on i his matter of Sunday games
and revels. Â¦ Well, if this be narrowness,
i I thank God for my narrowness. I want
! also to say that when you don't find me
j standing nrmly for good and all on one â
I and one onlyâ side of a question, then I
! am ready to step down from this pulpit.
' "I have been confronted with numerous
objections to my views as expressed last
I Sunday, the most common being that "Xo
! one has any right to criticize another per
; son's conduct. If such a monstrou3
I proposition be true, close up the churches,
the schools, the jails, take away the au-
thorlty of the Sheriff, the District At
torney. They can be of no use where
every man Is a law unto himself. So Ion*
as people do wrong there will be faithful
people enough everywhere to criticize
their conduct. Then ws to my havine: a.
monopolv of my opinion and no one belns
compelled to pay attention to my theories.
Now it Is not my opinion 1 preach. It la
God'sâ "Remember the Sabbath day to
kep it holy." Many who would condemn
work on the seventh day of the week
countenance pleasure. Do you not realize
that one man's pleasure means another
man's work? It's not what you think to
be harmful. It's what God declares you
cannot do.
"Then again I note with grief that sev
eral clergymen, who are to the fore in
the talk with the not original Idea that
Sabbath goins must depend upon indi
vidual conscience. It's not a matter of in
dividual conscience, it's a matter of God's
law. Conscience is not a good guide.
You can educate a conscience.
"I could (If I cared) show such a ter
rible picture of modern society's condi
tions that you would tremble. Then there
is this spirit of 'I have a right to spend
Sunday as I choose.' No sentiment can be
more dangerous. It is the spirit that
caused Initial sin In the Garden of Elen:
it is the spirit which would wreck every
Government on earth in twenty-four
hours if given the opportunity. No law
abiding citizen can evade the laws on the
statute book. No cne can disobey those
laws but anarchists and criminals, and for
them jails yawn black and threatening.
"Modern society people are anarchists of
the kingdom of God. If society wants to
get to heaven it will have to go the same
way as anybody else.
"I cannot close my discourse without
touching on the fact that no Methodists
were among those playing golf on Sun
day, They were all Catholics and Episco
palians. They tell me I should mind my
own business, but they need some one to
preach to them, and my pulpit Is the
world. O. those of you who represent so
ciety In my audience, the eye of All Is
upon your evory move. Let us not find
in you advocates of the breaking of God's
holy law."

San Francisco 6, Sacramento 5.
IF the god of fortune fasten his favors
upon any man or men, all that he or
they may do will avail opponents
naught."
So was it at the baseball game yester
day. San Francisco was plastered with a
covering of luck through which it could
not break. Many times the sacred nine
Hankorites did all they could to elevate
the Senate, but the upper house would
not assume its natural height. Thirteen
hits off Iburg. idoi that was, and only five
runs to decorate tho Senatorial escutcheon
reads, to say the least, as some dire mis
fortune. Then again" the Hanksmon
couldn't see Hughes' curves, all save
Iburg. who swatted out a triplicate of
doubles, three out of the five hits made off
Hughes' delivery. But six runs resulted
from these rive hits, which were buttered
with several molasses-like Senatorial
errors.
The crowd was the noisiest, the biggest,
the most enthusiastic and liveliest that
has fcvtr packed the Recreation grounds
for a baseball game. The fanatics were
congregated to hoot at anything, especial
ly the umpire. This they did in the sec
ond Inning when Sa.crumento pushed two
men over the rubber, botn runs calling for
a nice, discriminating, umpiral judgment.
Twice Krug tried to throw Sacramentoa
out at the plate and twice he failed. His
arm was good, his eye keen and Sullivan's
Kioves were in good sticky order, but
Hughes and Hanion were too swift of
foot, so the boy at the bell pulled the cord
twice and Hankville subsided.
After this Sacramento trod upon the
corns of the only man who worked the
luck game yesterday. In threo straight
innings Frisco made all its runs. Pabst
walked to llrst on lour bad ones, making
the sack journey on a subsequent steal,
family death and a wild Senatorial throw.
The third added a bunch of two runs to
Friscos' score. Reilly; Iburg and Hilde
brand played several colors of deuces with
Hughes, with the result of two ciangs
after the inning. Eut the fourth was a
shower of evil to Sacramento. A revelry
in wild pitching by Hughes, a hit by Iburg
and an error were all instrumental in
scoring Sullivan, Reilly and Iburg. Then
the local team stopped the run-making
game, giving 'he belated visitors a tantal
izing chance at it.
Here it was that tho Senators had the
luck of the proverbial canned shellfish.
The fifth was an old woman's surprise
party for them. A doublo by Stultz, a hit
by Dennie Â«nd another by Devereaux sent
the first named homeward. But Mclaugh
lin and Eagan tried the infield high suicide
act and both succeeded. Hughes there
upon hit the fence with the ball for two
bags, scoring Dennie. Hanlon walked and
the sacks were crowded with Statesmen.
"Kasy money," shouted some one on the
throbbing bleachers as Stanley walked to
the plate. He turned tho trick. Devereaux
scoring and again the bags were filled. It
was Doyle's chn nee next, but be showed
his pi(ty by thrusting the ball toward
heaven. Ancient Rube pocketed it.
As far as the score goes this ended the
match, but Sacramento gave Frisco some
spinal .i?.rs in the ninth. Several times
during the game the Senators coursed tho
bass only to perish at the doorsteps.
Perhaps the prettiest piece of fielding
was that of Eagan, who made a remark
able stop at second of a ground bail
throwing the runner out at first.
The score:
Sacramento 8, San Francisco 5.
Uncle Henry's nine met with a defeat on
the Oakland grounds yesterday morning.
The game, although noisy with hits, was
of the slow order. Knoll started the box
work fcr tho local team, but he was badly
punished at the outset and Fitzpatrick
was called in to deliver the leather.
The game lasted a full two hours, so
lonpr, in fact, that it was called at the end
of. tho first of the ninth inr.Aifr. Of course.
Hank knows he would have won had he
been given tho opportunity for the finish.
In the seventh and eighth the local team
picked up in work with the stick, scoring
thrâ¬>e runs on hits coupled with assisting
errors. K;i^nn at short was particularly
ragged in his fielding work and Schwartz
of San Francisco was none too good.
The score is:
SAX FRAXCISCO.

Wild Tralee Shows Old-

in Second Place.
Palo Alto, the Stake Favorite, Has
the Speed, but Lose3 by
Hesitating on the
Game.
There was much life and snap to the
running of Whitehead. the Lopez entry.
in the beginning of the final? of the
I'nion Park open stake yesterday, and aa
the hound went down the card showing
the way to all of his opponents his speed
seemed to increase. Against Wild Traleo
in the deciding course Woitehead took a
decided lead and won as he pleased, deny
ing a point to the runner-up. Under the
rare of Fred Price the fast bound r^e en
veloped a show of the speed that ho h***
Besses, and his condition was such that
no doc: in the stake figured to beat him.
Crawford Bra^s showed her fine breed-
Ing, and until rhe> was withdrawn put up
a clevor exhibition of coursing. In the
second round she took a hard course from
Annie Hall. The run was severe enoush
to warrant her withdrawal, but in tho
next round she went against Mose. The
talent flgurert on the gruelling work Braes
had done and thought little of her chances.
Slipped to a. strong hare the clotra went
to the same with Mose scoring- all of tho
points, and it looked that the price ot
rered on him. 6 to 1. was about right. It
was here that Braes did her fine work,
for when she joined in it waa all her way.
and her cleverness certainly merited tho
applause Riven her.
"v Alto - the stake favorite, threw
away hi* chances for the final by his oM
trick of laying off the game. In the sixth

According to the Mosaic teachings all were
absolutely equal before the law. The Israelite
was commanded to extend to the stranger nil
the tenderness and service of love which he
owed hts fellow Israelite. The One! or Israel
Is considered in the Bibl<Â» the Â«Jor1 or all hu
manity. The law was given to Israel for the
salvation cf all ir.ankind. The feeling of uni
versal tolerance among the Jews at nil tim*s
was the natural result of the Jewish bpllcf (n
one (Sod, one universe and one humanity. Th<?
essential bace of universal charity which trans
fuses the human heart with the tenderest
brotherly love, Judaism found In its convic
tion of the common origin of all mankind and.
es a result, that the whole human race will
ultimately be united In love, faith "and
thouKht, as children of the same parent on
earth and of the same father In heaven.

Gertrude, was united In marriage to Wal
ter Clark Howe of San Francisco. The
house was very prettily and tastefully
decorated, the prevailing color being
pink. Owing to the recent death of
the groom's mother the affair was
a very quiet one, only the Immedi
ate relatives and a few most inti
mate friends being present. After the
ceremony, which was performed Â«by the
Rev. Mr. Babcock of the Free Baptist
Church, those present partook of a dainty
wadding repast.
The bride, who is the daughter of John
F. Towle, one of Oakland's most promi
nent business men. Is a highly accom
plished young lady, well known in social
and musical circles on this side of the
hay and the possessor of an excellent
soprano voice. She has devoted much of
her time to music, being Identified with
St. Paul's Episcopal Church choir, the
De Koven Musical Club and kindred or
ganizations.
The groom, who is connected with the
equipment office, United States Navy De
partment, is well and favorably known
nmong the yachting fraternity on the
bay. He is one of the popular members
of the Corinthian Yacht Club, having
been identified with that organization for
a number of years.

Towa CoUesre.
The canvass was not an exciting one,
but there was real discussion of opposing
policies. Republicans emphasized the
Democratic opposition to resumption and
scouted Democratic professions of reform.
Democrats made much of Republican cor
ruption, and derided the candidate as an
obscure and uatried man.
The great Democratic "tidal wave" had
begun to rise in 1S74, v >cn the autumnal
elections gave surprising Democratic ma
jorities in many Northern States. The
same thing happened in 1S75 and made the
lower house of Congress overwhelmingly
Democratic. On the crest of the wave the
party bow hoped to ride triumphant into
the White House. But the reaction
against Republican rule had In a measure I
spent its force before the Presidential I
election. The first returns indicated a
Democratic triumph, and it was even con
ceded by most of the Republican news- !
papers on the morning after the election.
Nevertheless the Republican managers â¢
The Apparent Democratic Success.
A large and powerful Republican faction
favored reform within the party, and
deprecated the succession of an adminis
tration to be controlled by the methods
and the men whose ascendency had
brought reproach upon the organization.
Senators Conkllng and Morton were un
derstood to lead the representatives of
the "Grant dynasty," while of the other
aspirants Elaine was the most conspicu
ous?. The platform adopted by the con
vention recited at length the many claims
of the party upon the gratitude of. the na
tion, demanded the fulfillment of the
pledge for the resumption of specie pay
ments and for a measure of civil service
reform, deprecated sectional ill feeling,
eulogized General Grant, arraigned the
Democratic party as still "the same in
character ami spirit as when it sympa
thized with treason," and warned the
country "against trusting a party thus
alike unworthy, recreant and incapable."
Mr. Blaine's name led by a large major
ity over every other until six ballots had
been cast. and. even on the seventh, which
nominated Hayes. Blaine received n. larger
number of votes than at any previous
count. William A. Wheeler of New York
wns nominated for Vice President.
Mr. Hayes won favor by his warm sup
port of civil service reform, and secured
tne votes of an influential section of his
party whose members had determined to
refuse support to any candidate who
would not pledge himself to that measure.
Many others were drawn to him who,
would have voted against a more prom
inent and experienced Republican politi
cian.
The Republican Nominations.
Not the executive department only, but
the legislature also was invaded by the
general . demoralization. The building of
two railroads to the Pacific Coast, both
aided by large Government grants, had
furnished endless opportunity for pecula
tion and perversion of fund*. Many Sen
ators and Representatives were charged
with complicity in the scandals, which,
on inauirv, developed in connection with
the corporation known as the Credit Mo
biller, which had control of the
building cf one of the lines, The shadow
of suspicion fell even upon the nation's
Vice-president and upon others of scarce
ly less exalted positions. Doubtless not
all the charges were true, but many a fair
name was hopelessly smirched. An act.
popularly called the "salary grab." passed
by this same mistrusted Congress, re
ceived public attention out of proportion
lo its real importance. It was a bill to
increase the pay of members, and its spe
cial ignominy lay in its retroactive fea
ture by which the members of the exist
ing houses shared in the advance of sal
ary. The whole matter was insignificant,
but was regarded as one more evidence
of Republican rapacity. The act was re
pealed at the next session of Congress.
The Democrats as a Party of Reform.
The discreditable revelations Jn high Re
publican circles gave the cue to their op
ponents. The Democrats entered the
arena in 1ST6 as the party of reform. In
a platform of portentous length their
nominating convention demanded deliver
ance "from a corrupt centralization,"
from "the rapacity of carpet-bag tyran
nies" and "the contagion of misrule."
Reform In the civil service was favored,
as was a tariff for revenue only, and econ
omy and frugality in the national admin
istration. Repeal of the resumption act
was called for, and reform in the curren
cy. Samuel J. TiMen of New York was
nominated on the second ballot. Mr.
Tilden had shown moral and administra
tive qualities of a high order in the vari
ous State ofSces that he had filled, and he
commanded the fullest confidence of his
party. Hendricks of Indiana, who had
ranked second among the aspirants for
the Presidential nomination, accepted
the second place on the ticket.

a request not to patronize the shoe stores
after 6 p. m. except on Saturdays and

Miss Dorr says it was the little church
comedies in which she used to appear
that kindled her pnsslon for the stage.

American Academy, and when she was
Miss Dorr begins her engagement at
the Alcazar this afternoon, playing Dul
cie Larondlc in "Tho Masqueraders." It
is the intention of Manager Belasco later
on. to h;ivo Miss Dorr appear at a series
of special matinees in the Ibsen plays.
Miss Dorr is the wife of Henry j. W.
Dam. well known in San Francisco as
.secretary to former Governor Stoneman
and also as a short story writer and play
wright. Since going abroad Mr. Dam has
met with abundant success as a writer
for m.igaxines along scientific lines. He
has just sold a new play. "Princess El
sie." to Daniel Frohman, and he will
probably go to New York this winter to
aid in its production. He is now writing
with David Eelasco a new play for Mrs
I^slie Carter. It is entitled ""The Red
Mouse, and will be produced late this
coming winter.
WHEN Dorothy Dorr, the new
leading lady at the Alcazar, used
to act and sing for sweet char
ity's sake in amateur theatricals
given by a.n enterprising church society
ln the historic little town of Medford,
Mass., her admirers would marvel at her
wonderful versatility.
"Why don't you study for the stag:??"
they would ask. and although Dorothy
would axlmit to them that her one ambi
tion was to become a famous actress she
never told her father, for he was one of
those good old Puritanical men who saw
naught but demoralization in stage in
fluences. The death of the father, how
ever, removed the one reason that had
prevented her from carrying out her
plans. Instead of eqjoring Wellesley
College, as hed been her parent's wish,
she went to Franklin Sargeant, proprie
tor of the American Academy of Dra
matic Arts and acquainted him with her.
plans. That interview marked the begin
ning of a truly wonderful career, and to
day Miss Dorr ranks high In th<Â» histri
onic fi<-!d â an actress of rare talent and
a singer of recognized ability.
Howard Hall is to Ptar with Miss Dorr
In The Masqueraders." He is a play
wright and last seasan starred in "The
Soldier of the Empire.*
Miss Dorr was to have opened an en
gagement with David Belasco in New
Wk this fall, but the San Francisco
brother induced her to come West. She
is a woman of striking i^rsonality and a
charming conversationalist. It is likely
that she will give a series of private mu-
Blcalea at tho homes of some of the city's
wealthy society women during her stay
here.
Regarding the Knjrlteh stago Miss Dorr
says that it is <1Â«-lightful in one particu
lar respect. "Artists of prominence," she
Bays, "have more social prestige there
than in America. The English theater
seems to carry a social weight not char
acteristic of the American stage. It takes
a long time for an artist to win the Kng
iish people, but once they love you there
is no limit to their loyalty." This pecu
liar characteristic. Miss " Dorr says, is
more pronounced in San Francisco than
in any other American city. 'The West
ern people are critical, buMoyal to those
whom they like."
After closing a satisfactory season with
"Shenandoah" in New York Miss Dorr
went abroad and studied for the grand
opera under I^a Grange. Her first ap
pearance on the English stage was at the
Vaudeville in London in the society
drama. "Diamond Deane." written by
her husband. After a successful run she
played a round of parts in various plays
and then took Mrs. Patrick Campbell's
place as leading lady at the Adelphi.
While abroad Miss Dorr became a great
social favorite, numbering among her
most intimate friends Mrs. Craigie. who
writes under the name of Jdhh Oliver
Ho-bbs, and Colonel and Mrs. Fitz George.
Colonel Fitz George is a son of the Duke
of Cambridge, who is a cousin to the
Queen;
"The Golden Giant." at the Fifth Ave
nue. Later she played Catherine in Wil
liam Gillette's version of "Robert Els
more." and when "Shenandoah" was first
produced by a picked cast Miss Dorr
played Mrs. Haverill.
yet In her teens engapred her as leading
lady in "Held by the Enemy." After two
weeks In Chicago Miss Dorr was sum
moned by Mr. Frohman to New York to
take the principal role in a new play.
The State rate is much lower than last
year, and the Supervisors have lowered
the county general fund's apportionment,
and have left the school fund at the same
tigure.
The county infirmary fund has been
increased 2 cents, the money to be raised
by this additional tax to be used In erect
ing new buildings at tho infirmary. This
was deemed a better plan than trying
to bond the county, for the buildings are
badly needed and Alamerla County is now
without a dollar of bonded indebtedness.
The building to '.be erected with this
money will be a hospital proper with an
operatiner-room and emergency wards.
The buildings at the infirmary are very
old, and very expensive to maintain in
consequence. Dr. Clark, tho superintend
ent, has put them in excellent condition,
but they are crowded, and more room is
an imperative necessity.
The road fund has been increased in
order to make some needed improvements
In some of the mountain roads between
Alameda and Contra Costa Counties in

Corruption in High Places.
General Grant's second term was made
memorable by the discovery of numerous
flagrant instances of official corruption
in the Government and disgraceful scan
a. <?>
The civil-service reform so hopefully in
augurated by the act of 1S71, which re
quired the maintenance of a system of
competitive examinations for official ap
pointments, did not find favor with the
practical politicians who manipulated
party affairs. Their power ami influence
were restricted by the loss of the patron
age of which the act deprived them. Hy
the end of 1874 Congress would no longer
vote the necessary appropriations for
carrying on the work of the commission,
and the noxious spoils system was prac
tically restored in full vigor.
The Spoils System Once More.
Various causes were now bringing about
a formidable reaction against the party
so long in power. The "Liberal Republi
can" movement of 1ST2 hail given unmis
takable Indication of a turn In the tide
which was still more apparent four years
later. Certain elements which had join
ed the party during the war were drop
ping away as the special bond which had
held them was relaxed; the military policy
still persisted in in the South continued
to alienate a large independent section of
former adherents, while, as is usual, the
"hard times" which followed the crisis
of 1873were charged to ill-advised financial
measures of the Government. But among
the most powerful of the disintegrating
forces was a widespread belief that the
party had become radically corrupt and
untrustworthy.

Republican Decline.
The Settlement.
The result turned upon decisions respit

points, and these were relegated to an
Klectoral Commission created by Con

from each house of Congress and five
from the Supreme Court. Eight members
of the commission were Republicans,
seven were Democrats, and upon every

Hall was at one time District Attorney
of Santa Cruz County and afterward rep
resented that county in the State Assem
bly, where he did meritorious work. Af
ter leaving Santa Cruz he came to this
city and opened a law office at 214 McAl
lister street. He leaves a wife, but no
children.
The letter was written by Dr. Dcaa.
Hall left here several months ago to seek
his fortune at Cape Nome. He was ac
companied by Dr. Deas and several otn
er friends. According to the letter which
was received yesterday, Hall, becoming
dissatisfied with the condition of affairs
on the beach at Nome, decided to explore
tne country furtner inland. He* was ac
companied by two other men, both of
whom were experienced miners. After an
absence of several weeks Uie two miners
returned, bringing news that Hall, unaole
to continue furtner, had dropped down
In the snow and perished, his comrades
being unable to assist him. Only after
untold privations did they succeed in
reaching Nome in a condition bordering
on complete collapse. Tney feebly tola
the story of the fate of Hall and n rescu
ing party was immediately formed. Af
ter searching tne frozen ground where
Hall was supposed to have fallen they
returned to Nome without the body of
tne unfortunate attorney.
A letter received in this city yesterday
from Nome conveys the sad news that
James Hall, a well-known attorney, at
one time a member of the firm of Hall,
Ford & Kelly, perished in the frozen
North while searching for gold.
Was at One Time District Attorney
of Santa Cruz and Also Assem
blyman From That
County.

to Assist Him.

Chief Sullivan paid a visit to the "ten

places visited Billy Abbott's dive at 416
Dupont street. Abbott begged the Chief
to use his influence to get his license re
newed for another quarter at least to give
him a. chance to make some money before
retiring from the business, but the Chief
assured him that no renewal would be
granted, as the public opinion so demand
ed. The Chief said yesterday that the
licenses of none of the saloons in that
neighborhood would bo renewed, as the
places were all a disgrace to the city.
The dental department has for the last

as if the voters intend to send Dr C C

ALL preparations for the celebration of Labor day have been com
pleted and if the programme coes through without a hitch this year's
day will be the most memorable of Us kind.
The principal celebration will be held in Central Park, which has
been especially fitted up to furnish fun for the multitude. Carpenters have
been at work for a week on the gravity railroad, the dancing lloors, the au
ditorium and the tug-of-war platform. All will be brought into use from
30 o'clock in the morning on, nor will the park close until after midnight.
1 The tugs of war will be the features of the games. There -will be teams
from the carpenters, brewery workmen, cement workers and the sailors.
These teams will hold a tournament and then a special pull will be given
between a team from the fjerrickmen's and Engineers' Union and one from
any other union net in the regular tournament. Following the tugs of war
there will be races of all kinds and for everybody, hose coupling contests,
jig and reel dancing, a parade of babies for a beauty prize and a parade of
the ladles entered for the award to the prettiest.
At 2 o'clock the literary exercises in the auditorium will commence.
There Trill be an opening address by P. H. McCarthy, president of the day;
addresses by Andrew Furuseth, Arthur R. Andre, John R. McDougald, O. A.
Tveitmce and John C. Dernell. Then will follow a programme of instru
mental and vocal music, fancy dancing and specialties.
In the evening and during the latter part of the afternoon there will be
dancing for all in the gallery of the pavilion. There will be no parade, it
having been decided to hold the whole official celebration in the Central
Park grounds. The cup offered for the union making the best showing will
be awarded this year, but it has not yet been decided upon just what fea
ture the Judging will be made, ho cup, if won for threo consecutive
years, will become the property of the union winning it, and until it has
been so won It will be awarded every year on Labor day.
The committees in charge of the celebration are:

GREAT PREPARATIONS
MADE FOR LABOR DAY
Joseph Dean, charged with grand lar
ceny, has informed Chief of Police Sul
livan that he was forced to give up $2 50
to a policeman who had been instructed
to take him to the Hibrrnla Bank for
the purpose <;f allowing him to draw some
money which he had on deposit. The po
liceman, after taking: him to the bank, de
manded his "fee" and when Dean object
ed he threatened to use his influence to
have him pent to San Queniin. Thinking
he would not hesitate to have him "rail
roaded" to the penitentiary. Dean pave
him the amount he demanded.
Last Thursday morning Dean and a
â¢woman who Is known as Magerie O'Dea
were arrested for srrand larceny. It is
alleged that they robbed a bartender of
a jfoW watch and chain and $63 in gold.
After being locked up In the City Prison
Dean was visited by a Police Court prac
titioner named Clover, who, he claims,
represented that he had a "pull" with
Judge Kritz, before whom the case was
fÂ» be tried.
Dean engaged him to defnd himself and
thÂ« woman in the Police Court. When
The cases were called Glover asked for a
continuance until Wednesday, which was
granted. He then asked the court to al
low a. policeman to take Dean to the HI
b*rnia Bank, where he had on deposit
?208. The rest of the story, as told by
Dean, is as follows:
"While standing in the courtroom I
â¢was tapped on the shoulder by a police
officer, who told me he would accompany
me to the bank. After leaving the City
Hail he took off his star and pinned It to
his vest. We walked to the bank, and
nfter I had drawn my money he demand
*A 12 GO. I at first objected to Rivlnp him
any money, but as he threatened to use
his Influence to have Judge Fritz hold me
to answer I rave him the amount lie
iisked for. When I returned to the Cen
tral station iilover. the attorney, was
wmltlBS for me. and I gave him $00. The
policeman then took me to the City
Prison, after advising me not to say any.
thinp about the bribe under penalty, of
spending a lonu term In sSan Quentin."
Dean yesterday told his story to Chief
of Police Sullivan, and to-day an effort
will be made to establish the identity of
thÂ«> policeman who forced him to part
with a portion of his money.

Albert Lukes Plunges the Blade, of
a Pocket-Xnife Into His Ab
domen and Makes
His Escape.
While protecting his crippled brother
D. Harney, aged IS years, living at 1107
Mason street, was stabbed., in the abdomen
last night by AJberfâ Lukes, his next-door
neighbor.
Harney's brother and Lukes engaged In
a fight, and as the former was getting the
worst of it Hiirney, who witnessed the
trouble from a window of his home, rush
ed to the rescue. He grabbed Lukes and
attempted to induce him to go home, when
the latter suddenly pulled out a pocket
knife and plunged the blade into his vic
tim's abdomen. Harney fell to the ground,
while his assailant, evidently thinking
that he was fatally wounded, took to his
heÂ«-lp. l.'p to a late hour last night he had
not been arrested.
The wounded boy was carried to the of
fice of Dr. Greene, a short distance away,
where ai examination disclosed that the
knife had penetrated the abdominal cav
ity for a depth of about y*o inches, mak
ing a serious wound. After he was treat
ed by Dr. Greene the boy was removed to
St. Mary's Hospital by his parents.
Accoruing to the siory of the wounded
boy. Lukes has been in the habit of an
noying the crippled brother, and despite
his protestations he continued to abuse
and maltreat him whenever he met him
l^ast night young Varney was playing in
trout of his home, when Lukes, after call
ing him several vile names, started to
abuse him. Hearing his brother's cries
for help, the elder Harney boy rushed to
his assistance and ordered Lukes to de
sist. As the latter seemed determined to
"do up" the helpless cripple. Harney
seized him by the arm and threatened to
chastise him unless he went home. As
he promised to do so Harney released
him, and almost instantly Lukes drew
his pocket-knife and drove the blade into
Harney's bedy.
Although the condition of the boy lÂ«s
considered extremely dangerous by the
doctors at the hospital, they have hopes
ot saving h!s life.

William Warren, an employe Â¦ of tho
Empire Maltho.use and. residing at 935',2
Howard street, was struck and killed by
car No. 1174 of the Mission and Kearny
street line at Broadway and Kearny
street last evening. The unfortunate
man attempted to board the car by
clutching one of the forward braces. He
lost his balance and fell across the track.
His left arm. and right foot were almost
severed from his body and his skull was
fractured.
Warren was returning from his day's
labor and secured a transfer at the poini
where the accident happened from the
Third-street cars to Hie Mission cars
When the car for the latter line came up
from the ferry he attempted to board it
but went under the wheels. Thomas j'
Kennedy of 3273 Nineteenth street wai
with him at the time. Officers Arthur
Fowle and Special Daggett picked up tht
unconscious man and conveyed him to
the Harbor Receiving Hospital, but his
life went out just as he was laid on the
operating table.
Warren was about 30 years of age and
leaves a wife and three children.
The motormon of the car, K. J. Cassady
was taken to the Central Police Station'
and formally charged with manslaughter
He immediately procured bail and was re

been pointed downward, and he soon dis
covered that he was shot. The bullet had
struck his thigh, and, glancing downward,
lodged in the calf of his leg.
The Southern police station was notified,
and Lynch waa taken to the Receiving
Hospital, where his wounds were attend
ed to. It will be some time before he
will be able to walk properly again. He
had a narrow escape from a more serious
wound.
A number of recruits arrived at the
Presidio yesterday and were sent to
Major Potter at the Post Hospital tor
examination as to their fitness for toldler
life. Private Temple B. Snow was de
tailed to guide the "rookies" to the hos
pital in, order that they might not lose
themselves in the grounds, as sometlmea
happens.
Private Snow performed his duties in a
soldierly manner, and treated the pros
pective "Chino killers" in such a pleasant
manner that his suggestion i that they
leave their valuables with him, while
undergoing the examination was received
with thanks.
Two gold watches and about $70 were
handed over to the obliging Snow, and
the prospective warriors stripped to the
buff and went before the doctor without
any misgivings as to the safety of their
money and timepieces.
When the men had donned their gar
ments they thought nothing of Snow's
failure to appear, presuming that he was
awaiting them outside. Everything
favored the wily schemer, and In conse
quence, he was enabled to get away.
After waiting for some time for the
return of Snow the men thought they
would better go up to headquarters, still
unconscious of the fact that they had
been "done." An efrort was made to
tind the thief, but he had had such a good
start that no trace of him could be found
Thirty-one patients were sent yesterday
rrom the General Hospital to Washington
D. C. They were all surgical cases that
would not be benefited by further treat
ment, and as the hospital is greatly
crowded >ney were transferred to the
Soldiers' Home in Washington.
The pleasant weather at the Presidio
yesterday gave a large number of patients
an opportunity to enjoy an outing Thev
were scattered all over the grounds, and
regaled their friends with stories of their
experiences in return for the fruits and
flowers. Not the least uninteresting were
the heroes of the battle of Tientsin
Wherever there was a soldier wearng
a cap with a device showing him to be a
Ninth Infantryman there was sure to be
a large crowd, listening to tales of the
bloody battle at Tientsin.

His Revolver.
Theodore I^ynch. a newspaper man liv
ing pt 6."S Folaom street, was awakened
from his slumber about 3 o'clock yester
day morning by a noise that resembled
some one attempting to force open the
window of his bedroom. The more he
listened the stronger became his convic
tion that he was soon to be confronted by
a burglar.
Lynch had a revolver on top of tho bu

nervousness he pulled the trigger, and

Troop A Cavalry, Second Brigade, which
is to take part in the parade on Monday
next, was originally the first military or
ganization of San Francisco. It was or
ganized as the First California Guard
June 27, 1S50. before the admission of Cal
ifornia as a State. The name of the or
ganization was subsequently changed to
The Light Battery and when there was a
mustering out of the artillery regiment a
few years ago the members of The Light
Battery organized as Troop A.
A detachment of United States troops
has been ordered by General Shafter to
take part in the parade.
The troop and two companies of infan
try at Sacramento will not come to this
city, but in their stead there will be Na
tional Guardsmen from Fresno.
(TZ JUtlCEL M. THOMSON', for twenty
i=^\ one yrp.rs a member of the police
dz-^/ department ' ; Â»-d for over sixteen
yean th<> recognised head of the
mounted park patrol, has been shorn of
authority. Sergeant of Police Clarence
Â»'ooj;:'.n has been appointed by Chief of
Police Sullivan to puporeede Thomson and
<~n foot has undertaken to preserve order
:.r.<l prevent accident* In the city's great
pleasure place. Policeman Thomson, who
Lap for years been known as "Captain"
Tiir.msfn. probably owing to the dopart-
TTjerifs knowledge of his skill as a. horse
man, has been detailed to patrol the south
<irive from the entrance of the park to
the beach, a frequented stretch of road
covering several miles. Thomson's con-
Blgnmect to the "buck street" of the park
was the caus" of much comment yester
day, and if indications are to be relied
vpon will be for s-ime time to come.
When the charter went Into effect the
park patrol was mergt d into the regular
jolico department. From the authority of
the Park Commission the patrol passea

NEXT Saturday will be the first of
the four days of celebration in
honor of the admission of Califor
nia Into the Union on September
9, 1S50. Already a number of enthusiastic
citizens are decorating their places of bus
iness along the line of march, which will
be from the foot of Market street to
Montgomery, to Montgomery avenue to
Kearny, to Market to Van Ness avenue
to Pacific street, going out on the east
side 'of the avenue and countermarching
on the west side, dismissing at Market.
The reviewing stand, designed by the
honorary member pf the decoration com
mittee, Willis Pol^, is to be an extrava
gant affair, costing- $G00. It is to be lo
cated on the west"sido of the avenue, near
Post street. According to the honorary
member, it will bo "a gem of art" and
will bo different from any reviewing stand
ever before erected in this city. Still
there are a great many contributors to
the celebration fund who declare that $600
is pretty extravagant for something that
will bo occupied not more than four
hours and will have, to be taken down
immediately after the review.
There is a proposition to purchase- gold
badges at a cost not to exceed JS apiece
to he furnished to the president, vice
presidents and several other officers of
the general committee by the badge and
regalia committee in recognition of tho
valuable services they h:ivÂ«j rendered in
the celebration work.
The general committee has tendered a
vote of thanks to the directors of the San
Francisco Art Association for its resolu
tion to throw open the Mark Hopkins In
stitute of Art on September 10 and 11 free
to all who wear the badge of the Native
Sons of tho Golden West.
The literary committee has extended an
invitation to J. B. Whiitemore. great
grandson of Commodore. Sloat, to read
during the literary exercises the proc
lamatien of the Commodore on the occa
sion of the raising- of the American flag
at Monterey. >Ir. Whittemore is a mem
ber of National Parlor of this city.
Workmen were engaged yesterday in
slnkinp: tho postholes on Market street
for the poles on which are to hang the
parlands along the sirte of the street.
They were al*o stretchins the red, white,
blue and yellow lines of electric lights.
Army and Navy Parlor hns asked per
mission to have its members who belong
to the National Guard to be excused from
turning- out with the sruard no that they
raay be In line with the parlor.
Visa! la Parlor has issued special !nv!-
tention. Thouprh all other members of the
park patrol were ordered to report for
duty at P a. m.. Captain Thomson was In
structed to l>e ready for the saddle at S
a. m. The extra hour of duty thus im
posed tipon him has also been accepted by
many as a tribute to the officer's skill as
a horseman and preserver of the peace. At
present the proofs point otherwise.
Some timo ago Thomson made applica
tion to bÂ» appointed serpeant of the park
patrol. Behind him there -was consider
able influence. Amonp those who testified
as to his worth and devotion to duty was
Superintendent of the Park Mcl^aren.
Chief of Police Sullivan received his ap
plication â then lie piereon-holed it. Thom
son was instructed to continue his labors
as directed by the rules of the Park Com
mission. This be did. the mounte.l
patrolmen receiving their instructions
from him until yesterday morning.
Yesterday iiwrninp Serpeant Coogan,
who had been appointed to supercede
Thomson as the head of the park patrol,
went to the park. He informed Policeman
Thomson that ho hail been appointed to
relieve him and would henceforth take
rommand of the men under his control.
Thomson accepted the order and dis
mounted.
"I suppose you want the horse," he said.
"No." answered Coopan. "i will take
charge of the nark on foot."
"Have you any instructions for me?"
questioned Thomson.
"In ndiiition to the five beats known to
you," c'oocnn responded, "the Chief of Po
lice has cheated a sixth hf-at. which will
be known as the south drive brat. I have
been Instructed to detail you to cover that
beat."
Thomson rode way to cover the prounrt
given Into his keeping. Though the drive
which he coven is not as much frequent
ed an the main drives, many rigs wena
their wray to and from the beaeh over the
roail. It" stretches fr.r several miles along
the edce of the p;irk and has many wir.d
inps. If jit one end an accident oerurs
and the fates place Thomson at the other
end he will be held responsible for the ae
ciilent. thoupli durinK his sixtf^n years in
the p?rk a runaway has never passed him
and the lives he has saved number into
;he thousands. In the "bri^k street" of
the jinrk. a fart which Chief of Police
Sullivan doubtless believed worthy of con
sideration. Thomson will r.ot meet the
host of friends that daily saluted him
v/hen hf> was in rommand. He is now in
seclusion, and only ow.-pts the sound of an
alarm from the other end of his bent to
wreck his train of meditation wherewith
fcp Feel:s in the recesses of his mind th<*
cause that has brought him this reward
after twenty-one years of service.
The news that Mrs. Xettie R. Craven is
a patient at the private sanitarium of
Mrs. Reeves Atkinson at 1S15 Sutter street
and that Police Surgeon Bazet had pro
nounced her mentally wrong came with a
sudden shock to the friends of the famous
claimant to a widow's share of James G.
Fair's millions. The fact that she had
been taken to the sanitarium to be treated
for mental derangement resulting from
the long: and tedious litigation was not
known even to her intimates, and it was
only after persistent inquiries that she
was located at the sanitarium named.
Lunacy Commissioners Drs. Rethers ana
Lustig have been detailed by Judge Cook
to make an exhaustive examination of the
case. There is some suspicion that Mrs.
Craven may be shamming insanity in or
der to escape prosecution on tho indict
ment filed against her for perjury by the
Grand Jury. That the mental collapse
came about the time that her trial was to
commence gives some color to the sus
picion.
The doctors have been Instructed to as
certain whether her condition has been
caused by overindulgence in alcoholic
liquors. It is known that Mrs. Craven
has been In the habit of using morphine
to allay severe pains and fits of uncon
trollable nervousness. As her supply of
the drug at the sanitarium has been dis
continued it Is possible that her mind has
become temporarily shattered. The doc
tors will in all probability report the re
sult of their investigations to Judge Cook
to-morrow morning. While they found the
woman exhibiting symptoms of insanity,
they are r.ot yet prepared to declare her
insane.
Police Surgeon Bazet. who was detailed
by Chief of Toliro Sullivan to inquire into
Mrs. Craven's illness, filed his report on
Saturday. Or. Rizct was with Mrs. Cra
ven for only fifteen minutes, but during
that time ho learned enough to pronouree
her in a strious mental condition. While
the doctor declines to niakp his report
public h.- 1 admit? th:it Mrs. Craven is men
tally unbalanced. Whether the affliction
is temporary or permanent he is not pre
pared to say.
"I found Airs. Craven." says Dr. B.iaot,
"in n. hiprhly excitable condition. She be
came hysterical during mv visit and
Bhrioked so that her cries were heard in
neighboring houses. 1 am of the opinion
that the cauÂ«<? of her ailment is that her
use of morphine hns been stopped. It is
certain that tne lady was unable to appear
in court on last Friday; when rhe was
marked on the calendar for arraignment.
I could not tell whether sho was sham
ming in her terrible outbursts; as my ob
servations lasted only a short time. She
is in n. bad wny, however, and appears to
me lik.? a woman who hns succumbed to
the use of narcotics. Her ravinprs are
probably not all due to n disordered brain,
os some of them appear to be intentional.'
Her mania takes the form of a belief that
she, is being perpecutetd and that justice
1'as b?en denied her. She talks at random
on different subjects that have absolutely
no connection, but sometimes 1 thought
that she was putting it on. It is evident
to me that her nervous system has been
wrecked by the use of drugs.''

vestigation, Believes Her Men
tally Unbalanced From
Use of Drugs.
