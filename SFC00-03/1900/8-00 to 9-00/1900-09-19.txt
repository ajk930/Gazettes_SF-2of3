IN THE ANTHRACITE COAL REGION OF PENNSYLVANIA; WHERE THE MEN OF THE MINE WORKERS'
UNION ARE ON STRIKE AGAINST THE CONTINUANCE OF CERTAIN GRIEVANCES, ONE OF WHICH IS
THE COMPANY STORE, AT WHICH THEY ARE COMPELLED TO DEAL.
HARRISBURG, Pa., Sept. It-
Trouble Is brewing to-night In the
Lykens Valley region between the
union and non-union anthracite
miners over the refusal of the men
at Wllllamstown to join the strike. The
strikers In the neighboring towns of Ly
kens and Wuconisco threaten to compel
the Wllllamstown men to Quit work. A
meeting of the Willlamstown men was
held to-night, at which it was decided
to stand firm against any attempt on the
part of the strikers to force them to Join
the Etrike.
Sheriff Reiff to-day swore in 150 depu
ties, who will act in conjunction with a
double force of watchmen on duty at Wll
llamstown colllery-
The Willlamstown colliery was In op
eration to-day with a full complement
of 1100 men and boys. Rev. Father Logue,
rector of the Catholic church at Williams
town. Is working among; the mine em
ployes there to induce them to stay at
work.
Some of the strikers at Lykens and
Wuconisco threaten to drive out the men
at Williamstown before Saturday and se
rious trouble may be expected at any
time. There has been bad blood between
the Lykens and Wuconisco miners and the
men at Willlamstown ever since the re
fusal of the former In 1SS6 to Join the lat
ter In their strike against a reduction of
wages. -:v: :: : e'n
SECOND DAY'S DEVELOPMENTS.
more Collieries Close and Price of
Coal Goes Upward.
PHILADELPHIA. Sept. IS.â The- leader
of the strikers states that at the end of
the second day 118,000 of the 141,000 mine
workers In the anthracite fields are Idle.
No report of the mine operators makes
a statement for their side, but individual
mine-owners dispute the strikers' figures,
saying there are more men at work than
the union leaders will admit.
The first advance in the price of coal
as a result of the strike was made by
the Philadelphia and Reading Company
to-day, 25 cents per ton being added. Thla
advance was promptly met by the local
dealers, who increased the price to con
sumers 60 cents a ton, -
A cloud appears on the otherwise peace
ful horizon In the shapt of a report from
Harrisburg that a bitter feeling is devel
oping between the union and non-union
men in the Lykens district, located in the
upper end of Dauphin County and in
volving about 2500 mine-workers.
A concession was voluntarily granted 5000
employes of the Lehigh Coal and Naviga
tion Company In the region west of
Mauchchunk, who will i.ereafter work
ten hours a' day for a consequent Increase
in earnings. These, men were unorganized
and had not presented any grievances.
True to its declaration made before the
strike was ordered the Philadelphia and
Reading Company to-day brought its
mules to the surface in the two mines in
Shamokin that had been closed by the
strike and announced that they would be
permanently abandoned. This action
makes it necessary for the miners who
have been working In these collieries to
seek work elsewhere.
The action of the 400 or 600 employes of
the West End Coal Company at Mocana
qua, near "Wllkesbarre, in sticking to their
work stands out prominently as the busy
feature of an -otherwise idle territory.
They say they have no grievance, have
always received good treatment from
their employers and therefore resist every
effort to Induce them to Btrike.
STBIXERS GAIN BECRTJITS.
Six Thousand Additional Men Lay
Down Their Tools.
HAZELTON, Pa., Sept. 18.â The second
day of the anthracite coal strike has
failed to bring forth anything that would
lead to the coming together of the mine
owners and the strikers. Unless there is
a break in the ranks of either, it seems
to-night that a third party will have to
step into the breach and try to bring the
two forces together. I'
President Mitchell, in' his statement on
the situation throughout* the entire an
thracite region, estimates that about 6000
additional mine workers laid . down their
tools to-day, making a total of . 118,000
mine workers idle.
To-day was 'entirely devoid of Important
developments In this district, and' the lit
tle change in the situation was in favor of
the strikers. It was estimated yesterday
that of IC.000 mine workers In the Hazel
ton district about S000 did not resume
work. President Mitchell in his estimate,
however, raised these figures to 10.000.
Careful reports received from, every min
ing town in the region to-day warrant the
estimate that more than 1000 additional
men did not go into the mines this morn
ing. Not one operator was reported to
have increased his working force over
that of yesterday.
All was quiet in Hazelton* to-day with
the exception of a few petty cases of
breach of the peace. A crowd of mine
workers numbering about 100 marched
from McAdoo through the south side to
day, but caused no trouble. At Jeansville
seventy-five men at work fled upon their
approach. ,"./. -V-V,
Meetings of the strikers were held at
eight different points in the vicinity to
night. The following statement was is
sued by President Mitchell in behalf of
the striking mine workers:
Reports received at our office from districts
Nos. 1. 7 and 9 of the anthracite coal region
show that there have been great accessions to
the ranks of the strikers to-day. In district
No. 7 (Haxleton regibn) not less than 1500 mine
workers who mined yesterday failed to report
for work 'this morning, thus Increasing the
total number of strikers from 10,000 to 11.500
to-day.
In district No. 9 (Schuylklll) our forces have
been augmented by 4500 mine workers in addi
tion to the 30,000 reported yesterday.
The situation in district No. 1 (Lackawanna
Â¦Wyomlng) is practically the same as the first
day of the strike, only SCO men remaining at
work. â¢ The total number of men idle Is 113,000.
R From every section of the anthracite region
reports Indicate that much dissatisfaction pre
vails among those who have up to this time
failed to participate in the strike and we con
fidently expect* that the number at work will
grow less with each succeeding day until the
mine shall be completely closed.

Not Enough Survivors to Dig the

GALVESTON, Sept. 18.â "There are
only ten houses in a habitable condition
south of High Island," said H. Spangler,
general manager of the Gulf and Inter
state Company, who returned to-day from
a tour of inspection of the property of
his company. "There were thousands of
carcasses of animals and about 330 bodies
of human beings found there. The latter
have been partially buried, but the hands
and feet are protruding froni the earth
in many, places, and there are not enough
people left in that section to bury the
dead."
Mr. Spangler will endeavor to get a
party from here to go over and complete
the work of burying the dead. . He says
that thirty-one miles of the Gulf and In
terstate road has been destroyed and that
about eight miles of the right of way also
lost by the encroachments of the gulf. It
is too early to form a correct estimate of
the loss. Mr. Spangler says, however,
that he has no doubt the road will be re
built. . â

work of clearing the streets of debris la
progressing rapidly under the perfect or
ganization instituted by military rule un
der Adjutant General Scurry- More than
2000 men are engaged on t*ie work.
Ninety-eight bodies are reported a3 hav
ing been found in the wreckage and re
moved to-day, making a total of 1SS1 vic
tims so fur recovered. Tiris list is far
short of the actual number of the dead
found. The bodies recovered are burled
or cremated, and no systematic record
has been kept. The storm wrecked al
most every vault in the six cemeteries,
and many of the dead were washed to sea
in metal cases. So far only one casket
has been found. It had been carried three
miles from the vault.
The extension of the electric lighting
system continues. By to-morrow the dis
tance from Twentieth to Twenty-seventh
streets and from the bay to Broadway
will be equipped with lights. More than
200 skilled mechanics were brought here
to-day from -:as cities.
The total numuer of dead is still esti
mated at from 5000 to u^O. The newspaper
list is over 4000. The naraea of many ne
erots; Mexicans, Italians and other for
eigners can never be obtained.
The work under the direction of the
Health Department was pushed with
vigor to-day. As disinfectants arrive they
are distributed over the city, and large
quantities are arriving. Over a carload of
' disinfectants was taken from the wharves
to-day and sent to the Health Department
Supply Depot, and almost as much was
taken from that place and distributed
over the city. As fast as it can. be done
the city is being placed in a thoroughly
sanitary, condition.
Medical Attention for All.
Much was done to-day in the way of
| removing debris and disposing of animal
I carcasses. The sick and wounded are re
ceiving the best of treatment, and the fa
cilities are such that any one needing
medical attention can have it by applying.
Besides the other hospitals and medical
relief stations already in service the Ala

The outlook from a health standpoint la
very encouraging. Three piledrivers are
at work closing up the breach In the Gal
veston Bay bridge made by the steamship
Roma. The rebuilding of the bridge is
progressing rapidly and It is expected that
trains will be able to cross on Thursday.
Orders have been issued to allow freight
to proceed to Galveston. The one bridso
will be heavily taxed to accommodate all
the trains. The tracks on Galveston
Island will be completed to the bridge to
morrow noon. Engines are again run

The night meeting in this city which
was addressed by Mr. Bryan was held in
a big three-ringed circus tent which cov
ered, several thousand people. Mr. Bryan
did not appear until ten minutes past 9.
He was received with deafening cheers,
and the applause did not subside for sev
eral minutes. He spoke with evident ef
fort, his voice being quite hoarse as a re
sult of the severe campaigning of the past
few days. The speech was upon general
lines and did not develop many new
points.
Much attention was given the Philip
pines. A shrill-voiced person In the audi
ence asked Mr. Bryan why he had advo
cated tho ratification of the Spanish
treaty, to which question he replied:
I will tell you, my friend, why I wanted It
ratified. I wanted the treaty because I wanted
the Spanish war closed; I wanted the volun
teers brought home, and I wanted to take
from the Republican party the war expend
itures, and I -wanted -to give to the Filipinos
ourselves that which we could have 'procured

KANSAS CITY, Sept. 18.â Armourdale,
tho center of tho packing-house and
stockyards" Interest pf Kansas, turned out
a great crowd to-night to hear William
J. Bryan, who spoke in Shawnee Park.
He Srrived In Kansas City at 5:30 and
was driven across the river to the meet
ing place, arriving at 6:15. The employes
of the various establishments In the
neighborhood had already ceased labor
and large numbers of them had gathered
In the park despite the threatening sky
and even a slight fall of rain. The work-
Ingmen gave the closest attention.
To-nipht Mr. Bryan spoke in a huge
circus tent In Shelly Park, in the heart
of the city. .Mr. Bryan's speech was ad
dressed entirely to the labor element. He
said in part:
If we talk to the Republicans about the Im
portant issues of this campaign they .meet our
argument with one answer, and that Is the
"full dinner pall." If we ask the Republicans
why for three and a half years they have
failed to give to the laboring men protection
Irom government by injunction the only answer
ls that the laboring man has a full dinner pall
and he ought not to object- to government by
injunction if the' dinner pall Is full.
The full dinner pall is satisfactory to the
stomach, but, my friends, it ls the animal and
not the man that complains only when it is
hungry and goes to sleep when It is full. I
want to appeal to something In the laboring
man besides his appetite. I want to ask the
laboring roan If he is content to live and die
with nothing more than a full dinner palh
Mayor Jones of Toledo well described it when
he said that the laborer always had a full din
ner pail In slavery days; that the Slav* had
plenty to eat because he could not wo* if he
did not have plenty to eat. He said that the
slaveowner had aÂ«selfish interest In giving to
the slave a full dinner pall and plenty to eat
and wear. . % ,
Man is- of a threefold nature. He not 'only
has his body but has his brain, and he has his
heart also, and the laboring man needs more
than three meals a day. He needs shortened
hours of labor j to enable -him to give some
time, to his family and to intellectual . develop
ment.
What has the Republican party done to
shorten the hours of toll? When the eight-hour
law went before the Senate the Republican,
Senate did not have time to pass it, but the
Republican Senate had plenty of time to pass
a financial bill that gave the national banks
the control of the paper money of the coun
try. (Applause.)
The Republican party had plenty of time to
legislate when it wanted to legislate, but where
Is the bill that protects the laboring man from
the fear of the Injunction? We are opposed to
government by Injunction.
In our platform we ask for a labor bureau
with a Cabinet officer at Its head. .What does
the Republican party ask for? Why. a department
of commerce and industry. We- also ask for the
election of Senators by the people. You can
not get any remedial legislation until your bill
passes the Senate as well a3 the House. Un
der the present method of electing Senators the
corporations have more influence In the selec
tion ot a Senator than they should have, and
the common man, the ordinaryÂ»voter. has less
influence than he should have. (Applause.)
W e want an income tax. The Republican
party is not willing that we should have an
Income tax, which would give to tha labor
ing man some relief from the burden of tax
ation. You laboring men ought to consider the
question of taxation and these other questions,
but the only reply you get to a.11 these things
Is the "full dinner pall." (Applause.)
Whenever any . Republican holds up before
you the full dinner pall argument, ask him
what he thinks of the anthracite coal region.
(Great applause.) Ask him what he thinks of
less than a dollar a day, which Is received by
the men who are mining anthracite coalâ less
than a dollar a day the year round. Under
those circumstances, what chance ls there for
tho laboring man to Improve his condition?
What chance for him to raise his family and
to give his children a higher place than he
has enjoyed? What chance is there for that
development Intellectually: and for that recre
ation and for those things that are necessary
to the laboring man as well' as to any one else?
(Great applause.) Â¦ ., Â¦ .-Â¦â¢*Â¦
But the full dlnnner pall will not last this
campaign. The Republican party has got to
meÂ«tÂ» these questions and cannot entice the
laboring man .into the Imperialistic - trap by.
BRYAN DISCOURSES ON
THE FULL DINNER PAIL
Senator Hoar would convince you that he
opposes it from conscientious motives, but is on
all other points a unit with the party from
which he differed in that one respect and that
he is a supporter of William McKlnley. With
these two together I would tear the mask off
I wish I could have together on this platform
William J. Bryan and Senator George F. Hoar
that each might tell his reasons for opposing
"cxranslon" or "imperialism."
You will find my text In the letter of accept
ance of the great apostle of free silverâWil
liam J. Bryan. It is his last card and he be
gins his Interesting appeal to the people of the
United States by telling what he knows about
trusts. At the Kansas City convention there
developed a wide difference of opinion in the
Democratic party as to what they should do or
ought to do and various pilgrims to Lincoln
found Mr. Bryan very uneasy, as well he
might have been, since the narrow edge of onÂ«
vote in the Convention meant the saving of his
pet hobby â free sliver. But how has it been
since that convention? In all his speeches dur
ing his campaign he has made only the barest
references to free Bllver. But he took up an
other issue, one which he labored in Washing
ton to manufacture. He gave positive orders
to certain members of Congress to ratify tho
treaty for no other reason than that he might
have an imaginary chance to attack the ad
ministration.
CHICAGO, Sept lS.-Senator M. A.
Hanna at noon to-day made an address
to several thousand downtown business
men and their employes at the rooms of

in part:
Bryan tells what he would do If elected.
His first act would be to haul down the Amer

what he says he would do, but the American
I would like Mr. Bryan or any other Demo
crat to tell me what a trust ls. I believe
there ls not a trust In the entire United State*.
There la a national law and in every State a
law acainst trusts and each law, national or
State, hns been the product of Republican law
makers and the credit ls due the Republican
party. I have no objection to the Democrats
opposing trusts, but they have not got any
patent on It.
If our great corporations of amalgamate*
capital are in the interests of manufacture,
then are not labor organizations and combina
tions In the interests of the worklngman? I
was the first man in Ohio to recognize organ
ized labor in 1871, and while that organization
of bituminous coal miners existed we never had
a strike. I believe In arbitration between la
bor and capital, and in 1S97, when 1 stood
before 7jOO men and women in Cincinnati, told
them that If they would prove to me that I
had ever wronged any man working for me or
urged the reduction of his pay I would resign
from the United States Senate the next day,
and the offer still stands.
One stands on the firm foundation of his con
victions of right and the other on the flimsy
foundation of hypocrisy. Mr^ Bryan has been
afraid to push the silver 1bsuÂ« because he wants
to carry New York and some other Eastern
States.- He tried imperialism and made from
flve to fifty speeches a day, his audiences grow
ing less and less every day. It is his trump
and last card and we will hold him down to
that issue and on every side of it.
tho face of that hypocriteâ William J. Bryan.
(Cheers and hisses.)
Bryan talks of the Monroe doctrine and ad
vocates a protectorate in the Philippines. The
Monroe doctrine was established for the West
ern hemisphere, but Bryan would spread it all
over the world. If that ls not imperialistr
then tell me what it is. I am for peace, but
not for peace at any price and not while tho
brigand. Aguinaldo. ls hanging about In the
bushes, shooting down our soldiers. Bryan ia
opposed to a tariff as a trust creator, but th?
workingmen know that the tarlfT is their pro
tector. He tells us rosy pictures of what hi*
would do If elected and beside his pictures
stand the monumental work that McKlnley hai
done.. Bryan will stand on any platform they
make for him; ride any hobby, indorse any
isiueâ yes, he will even abuse me for thn
sole purpose of being President. That is all
he wants. (Cheers and cries of "You are all
right.") 4
Yes. I am all right, for I talk about things
I know aH about, and I ffon't lie. either. Cast
your votes In your own Interest and not in th*
Interests of Mr. Bryan. The importance o;
this campaign ls greater than any ever befors
known In the country, because any reversal of
the policy of the Government would bring about
a change In commercial Interests which would
dwarf the awful storm at Galveston. It would
mean a commercial and industrial revolution
from which this country would not eoon re
cover.
people would not let him. Then he would
establish a "Btable government," probably
with Aguinaldo at the head of it. Think of tt!
Pull down our flag, remove our troops and
leave the brave dead, our boys In blue, to th*
tender mercy of Agulnaldo! Judging from the
past Agulnaldo would soon shock humanity
and the nations would' interfere as we did in
Cuba.

PROSECUTION IS NEARLY
THR0U6H IN HOWARD CASE
Testimony to the Effect That Defend
ant Ram From the State House
After the Shooting.
FRANKFORT. Ky.. Sept. IS.â The pros
ecution concluded its direct testimony in
the case of James Howard to-day.
Ben Rake, a stable boy, corroborated
Bowman Galnes as to seeing Howard run
oxrt from the State House grounds shortly
after the shooting.
James P. Daly and R. O. Armstrong
testified to seeing Howard standing on
the Â£teps of the State House later that
morning. - : --V'. !
W. 11. Culton, one of the alleged con
spirators, went over his former testimony
affecting Howard. He claimed that How
ard exhibited cartridges to him, and also
pointed slgniilcantly to a broken paling of
the fence. Culton said he asked Howard
what he meant by this, and the latter
told him to "not ask" so many C n fool
questions."
This was the afternoon of January SO.
Culton also said that the . day after the
shooting Youtzey came into the Secretary
of State's office. He had just received his
salary as a clerk in the Auditor's office
and. laid it down on a table, saying: "I
am'golne to take the number of these
bills. I am likely to be arrested, and If
this money ls taken from me I want to
have some sort of memorandum of It."
Culton says he asked Youtzey what he
expected to be arrested for, Youtzey re
plying: "Well, never mind. I am likely
to be arrested."
The defendant will take the stand as
the first Â¦witness In his own behalf: He
claims an alibi, and the attorneys for the
defense say they will bring overwhelming
proof that Howard was standing in front
of the Board of Trade Hotel, two squares
away from the scene of the tragedy,
when the shooting occurred.

In His Speech He Urges Voters to
Avert the Panic That Would
Follow Bryan's Election.
BUTTE, Mont., Sept. IS.â General Rooae
velt's special train arrived here about 4
o'clock this afternoon and the party was
given a hearty reception. The carriage
ride from the station of the Northern
Pacific to the Butte Hotel, about a mile
distant, was attended by a flattering: dem
onstration. The streets were lined with
people. At the hotel Governor Roosevelt
appeared upon the balcony. The crowd
I below- entirely filled the street for a blocl^I
In either direction. (Jovernor Roosevelt
was urged to speak, but he declined, say
ing he would see the people at the Colum
bia Gardens in the evening.
The Immense -buildiiig' at Columbia Gar- j
dens was" entirely filled to-night and
standing room was at a discount. Gov
ernor Roosevelt talked for nearly three
quarters of an hour. He spoke in part
as follows: .
I have spoken to" you, gentlemen, about
preaching the gospel of hate. The foules:
wrong that can- be done to our citizenship is
done by the man who preaches that Kospcl.
Whether he i.rcaches to the employe to see
to it that the protection of his own Interests is
asjainst tfce Interest* nf the employer or
whether he seeks to combine politics and set
the emDloyes against their employers, it mat
ters not which. H.-ia wrong. Ktehty years a*o
wÂ» were told that the capitalist had grown
rich; that the capitalist had prospered ami that
we should down him. We sot Mm down. The
capitalists were ruined and the wageworker
came to the verse ot starvation.
That was the effect of the action of mis
guided men. >Tow, ftentlemen. the only way
to permanently secure ivfll-lwMns; In this coun
'try Is to secure conditions that will secure the
well-being of all. PomnhinK can be done by
legislation: much can b* done- by- association
of Individuals.
I appeal to you for the *ake of our Internal
well-being, for the sake of the position or this
nation in the face of nations of the world that
you stand by us in this contest. We stand at
the threshold of a new century- The (tenera
tion In the century that has Just closed has j
done a great work and laid the foundation of
our government upon a strong footing by the
success of the civil war. We have conquered
this continent. We have established a gov
ernment under which there has been such
prosperity, liberty and power as the world has
never before seen. Now I appeal to you, the
men who made the West, and to yog who
glory In your strength. - in your courage and
your power, to see to It that the nation does
not act as you would be ashamed to sfe any
individual act; that the nation does not shirk
from the task that has been laid out for It ta
perform; see to It that the nation now realizes
that when it takes a position In the'foremoht
rank of nations. It must be prepared to' meet
and to overcome all the difficulties that all
great powers are sure to meet.
I would ask you to support us in this con
test in the first place, because In so doing you
can preserve the conditions of material pros
perity and avert a panic of disaster that would
be more widespread and more far-reaching than
any which this country has ever known; and,
furthermore, because It has been given to us
to be furnished a standard-bearer who has
embodied In his policy the principles which
have led us forward to this position among the

city has been enveloped In a heavy smoke,
while at times the air was most oppres

is raging in the brush between Aromas

The fire started yesterday morning about
10 o'clock on the George King ranch and
since that time has burned over the
Smith. Archer. Read. Vlerra and other
tracts, burning all the feed and fences In
its path.
It waa estimated at 3 o'clock this after
noon that the tire had burned over 1500
acres, with little prospect of checking the
flames. As yet no houses or barns have
been consumed .by the flames. The Iops
to the various ranchers over whose prop

I N CONVENTION
AT LOS ANGELES
SACRAMENTO, Sept. !S.-Oeorge Putt- j
man, a convict in the Folsom State j
Prison, who had previously been found t
guilty of the murder of another convict j
named John Showers and sentenced to.be ;
hanged, was to-day resontenced by Judge |
Hughes of the Superior Court. This time ;
the hanging was set for October 5 next, j
Puttman was sent to Folsom from San j
Francisco in September. IS'jo. for ten years j
for burglary. He had been an associate i
of the Major bovs of Oakland and was |
greatly attached to Abe Majors, who Is ;
now in a Utah jail uoder a reprieve from ;
& sentence to be shot for murder. Show- i
ers, it was alleged, turned State's evidence j
agninst Alajor s lather, who iiad been
banged for murder. For this he was
staboed to death by Puttman.
At the time Showers met his death he
was serving a life sentence at Folsom. j
Puttman's case was carried to the Su
preme Court, which lately affirmed the
judgment and oider of the lower court. |
When asked by Judge Hughes to-day if
he had anvthinf? to say why judgment
should not" be pronounced. Puttman re
mained seated, out his attorney objected
to the proceedings upon the ground that
the court was without Jurisdiction be
cause the homicide had been committed
within the walls of a State prison, and
while Putiman was a ward of the State
whose civil rights had been taken from
Mm and therefore was incapable of de
fending himself and civilly was dead.
The further objection was made that no
crime had been committed because Show
ers, at the time he was killed, was serv
ing a life sentence an-1 was therefore
legallv dead.
It was also contended that Puttman had
never been Indicted by a Grand Jury, and
that the court could only impose sentence
to take effect after the ten years' sen
tence, which Puttman was serving at the
time he killed Showers, had expired.
Puttman's sfttorney also pleaded Insanity
as the cause of his client's act, and asked
that the court have the sanity or insanity
of Puttman determined in the manner
prescribed by law. Judge Hughe? over
ruled all the objections to the court re
sentencing Puttman.
Puttman was then told for the second
time that he must die for the killing of
Showers. The condemned man betrayed
no emotion whatever when he heard the
words of the Judse directing that he be
hanged on Friday. October 5. Puttman
was taken to Folsom in a hack by Deputy
Sheriffs Hlnters and â¢ Couran.

BY M. E. CONFERENCE
PACIFIC GROVE. Sept. IS.â Rarely â¢
Indeed have the members of the |
California Annual Conference gone r
to their several homes so worn j
out with the almost overwhelming j
amount of work a.Â« they did to-day. ,
The session of this conference has
been all too- short for the business j
to be transacted, but the crowding was ;
unavoidable on account of the Bishop's j
having to be in Los Angeles in time to |
open the Southern California Conference j
to-morrow. Business, therefore, waa !
pushed up to the very last moment in j
committee, cabinet and public sessions. |
The change in the arrangement of dis
tricts has made the cabinet business es
pecially difficult this year, and the
Bishop and presiding e'.ders worked upon
the ministerial appointments until Just
before the adjournment of the confer
ence. The present arrangement contains ,
five instead of four English districts, viz..
San Francisco, Sacramento, Oakland.
Napa and San Jose, and the new Pacific
Japanese Mission containing the entire
Pacific . Coast section and Hawaii, the
Swedish and the Chinese districts.
The final session of rhis conference was
called to order at 8 a. m.. Dr. E. R. Dllle
presiding, and the tirst business of the \
morning: was* hearing reports of commit- !
tees not heard yesterday. The report of |
the committee on "State of the Country i
provoked a similar controversy, though ,
of a much milder character, as was j
caused last night by ihe temperance re- |
port. The report was finally adopted, af
ter all that tended toward a political char
acter or toward committing the confer
ence to any political policy had been elim
inated.
Bishop Hamilton arrived at 9:15 and
took charge of the' conference. After the
report of the committee on Japanese mis
sion work. Dr. M. C. Harris, formerly
presiding elder of the old Japanese dis
trict, nor,' divided from the conference,
made a few farewell remarks. Dr. \V. C.
Evans of Stockton offered the following
resolution, which was adopted by a unan- i
imous rising vote:
\Vherea5. The General Conference has sta
tioned the Rev. Bishop John W. Hamilton, D.
1>., LL.. U.. as resident Bishop at San Fran
cisco, and the Board of Bishops has designated
htm as the president of our conference for 19G0.
Wl:er?as, We have greatly enjoyed his pres- ;
ence among us and he has captured our hearts |
by his brotherly treatment, and
Whereas, We look to him to lead 'us In a
great forward movement during his residence
on the Pacific Coast, therefore be it
Resolved. That we will most gladly and
cordially receive him as our presiding Bishop
at any time he shall be eent to us by the
board of Bishops, and therefore, be it
Resolved. That we respectfully and earnestly
! urge. In view of the special conditions existing
on this coast, that his colleagues of the Board
or Bishops return him to preside over our con
ference in the fall of 1901, and further
Resolved, That our secretary be instructed
to forward a copy of these resolutions to the
Board of Bishops at their spring meeting In 1901.

STOCKTON, Sept. 18.â The second day's
racing was a vast improvement over
yesterday, both as to attendance and pro
gramme. It was announced as ladies' day
and the grandstand was aflutter with au
tumn finery. The scene gave the famous
grand stand a touch of old-time life and
Interest. The programme was not up to
that provided for the next four days, but
the pacing race, which was the card, pos
sessed enough uncertainty as to result to
float plenty of pools and excite interest.
It was termed a 2:25 class and the purse
was $500.
There were five entriesâ Queen, Tags,
FTederieksburg. Maud R. Jennie S and
Cleon. Tags and Frederlcksburg were the
favorites in the pools. In the first heat
Tags led to the quarter. From there to
the half Fredericksburg and Tags were |
nose and nose. Queen went off her feet I
at the quarter, but managed to finish
within the limit. The horses went under
the wire In the following order: Freder-
Icksburg'. Tags, Jennie S, Cleon and
Queen. Maud R was distanced. Time,
2:14%.
In the second heat Tags crossed the
wire half a length ahead of Fredericks
burg, who was two lengths ahead of Jen- I
nie S, with Cleon out of sight and Queen
distanced. Time, 2:15. The third heat
went to Tags by a length over FYeder
icksburg. with Cleon third and Jennie S
fourth. Time, 2:13. Tags took-the fourth
heat, making him three out of five and
winning the race. Fredericksburg second, I
Jennie S third and Cleon fourth divisions
of the purse. Coming down the stretch
Cleon tore the boot off her forefoot and
cut herself badly. Time, 2:16.
The other races were rather tame, but
lively enough to keep the money in circu

Passes Resolution Denouncing
the War Stamp Tax.

was advocated at the opening of thÂ«> twen
ty-sixth annual convention of the Na

on the drug was urged as a means to
rrake its use more available and save to

the Government as duty on the 20fi/NKi
pounds of opium annually imported.

PORTSMOUTH. Sept. IS.â "Kearsarge
day," to which the people of this city and
State have been looking forward for many
months, and which included the presenta
tion of commemorative tablets to the new
battleships Kearsarge and Alabama and
the presence of present and former Sec
retaries of the Navy, the Governor of
Alabama and other distinguished guests,
opened with prospects which were far
from pleasant. After a very tempestuous
night, during which it raJned heavily and
a strong northwest gale blew, the sky
to-day was cloudy and dull and rain was
falling. At a meeting of the committee
having charge of the celebration it was
decided that the formal presentation ex
ercises should be postponed until 3 o"clock.
The decorations did not suffer much from
the wind and rain, and after a few minor
repairs appeared as beautiful as ever.
The guests and speakers occupied a spe
cially erected stand In the park. The
area In front of the stand was crowded
with spectators and there was much en
thusiasm.
Mayor Edward E. Mclntire opened the
proceedings with an address of welcome
and then introduced Charles H. Burns of
Wilton as president of the day. Mr. Burns
spoke at length of the significance of the
occasion and presented Miss Mary Thorn
ton Davis of Boston, niece of Lieutenant
Thornton, executive officer of the old
Kearsarge, and Mrs. Henry Bryan of
Alabama, daughter of Rear Admiral
Simms of the old Alabama. Miss Davis
unveiled the tablet destined for the Ala
bama, while Mrs. Bryan performed a like
act with that of the Kearsarge.
Governor Frank W. Rollins was then
introduced and made a brief address,
presenting the tablets to Captain Folger
of the Kearsarge and Captain Brownson
of the Alabama.
Secretary of the Navy John D. IÂ»ng re
sponded on behalf of the Navy Depart
ment, lie said In part: ,
I deem it an honor that it falls to my lot
in behalf of the navy of the United States-and
the navy of the United States was never more
glorious thaft nowâ to receive from the State
of New Hampshire this, its beautiful and sig
nificant gift to the battleship Kearearge.
named for one of Us noblest mountains and
rtrttllinK its namesake of brilliant memory.
Words fail to express the full meaning of this
emblem which New Hampshire to-day places
on the derk of the Kearyarge. Dut it speaks
for Itself as no human tonxue can speak. It
breathes the full, outflowing lif* of our common
country and of all that our country meansâjus
tice, honor, freedom, education, equal rights,
la.v' order, home, church, school, public spirit,
private virtues, personal jntÂ«grity and honesty,
rewarded labor, thrift and accumulated sav
inKs no high or low. no rich or poor, no north
or south, or east or west, but one common
brothfrhood under the flap. It is a beautiful
designâ North and South clasping hands under
tho wings of an American eafjle. I can suggest
but one Improvement In it â not possible as a
matter of art. but entirely bo as a matter of
factâ and that is that Instead of two figures
there should be but onp, as there Is in fact
but on* figure embodying in Itself the per
fpt-ted I'nlon of all the land, not only the
North and South with their varying character
istics in trade and tradition but one In tho
supreme essence of a common nationality.
Governor James H. Johnston of Ala
bama accepted the Alabama's tablet. Be
cause of the Inclement weather the pro
posed exercises on board the battleship
Kearsarge were omitted and Captain
Folger of that vessel was introduced and
accepted the tablet on behalf, of the of
lH-ers and men. extending -to the State
and city their appreciation of the gift.
Captain W. H. Brownson, commander
of the Alabama, was also introduced and
spoke on similar lines.
The exercises were concluded with
an historical address by former Secretary
of the Navy Herbert, who said in closing
his remarks:
"I thank God that I have been per
mitted to see this day, to attend tills
union jubilee, this hearty handshaking of
New Hampshire and Alabama, testifying
In unmistakable language that every citi
zen of our country can at least realize
the full forr*> of those beautiful words,
'each of the forty-five States of our na
tional constellation shines with an equal
dfjrrep of splendor and no star on the
blue of our country's flap differs from
any other star thereon in glory.' "

New Alabama and the
Kearsarge.

VICTORIA, B. C, Sept. 18. â As a result of the inquest held to-day to inquire into the
deatli of Henry Saunders, one of the victims of the railway accident at Ladysmith on Satur
day, Nathan P. Dougan, the operator at Ladysmith, was committed for trial on a charge of
manslaughter, the Coroner's jury finding that the accident was due to his negligence. Â«
After the finding of the Coroner's jury Dougan was taken before a magistrate and
committed for trial. He admits that the accident, which cost four lives, was caused by his neg
lect. In his evidence before the Coroner he said that he had not looked to see' if the train was
in the yard when he reported it. He took it for granted that it was in, and wired the dis
patcher without ascertaining whether it was or not.
Two of the victims, Henry Saunders and Hugh Thompson, were buried here to-day.
The funerals were largely attended.
Dougan will be placed on trial on the serious charge on which he has been committed
at the next Assizes.

RINGLING'S CIRCUS WILL
REACH THIS CITY TO-DAY
Street Parade, a Most Magnificent
Pageant, Begins to Move at
10 O'Clock.
This morning the parade of Rlngllng
Brothers' great circus will pass along tho
streets of San Francisco. The pageant
will start at 10 o'clock. The route will bo
over the following streets: Folsom to Six
teenth, to Howard, to Second, to Market,
to Montgomery, to California, to Kearny.
to Market, to Valencia, to Sixteenth, to
Folsom, to show grounds.
This 13 circus day. This fact means a
whole lot to many in thi3 busy world. Tho
Rlngling Brothers' cirrus, which is the
of so much newspaper comment,
JHmeÂ» to San Francisco for the first timo
with a greater prestige than any show
that has heretofore visited California. It
is an enormous enterprise of tho circus
kind. The sixty-five cars necessary to
haul the equipment of the plant kept the
railroad officials busy yesterday and early
this morning In ferrying them acroaa tku
bay. At the eircus grounds. Sixteenth
and Folsom streets, everything was bud
tle and rush before dawn.
The earliest arrivals on the- grounds
were the commissary wagon, and those
containing the kitchen and dining-room
tents and their furniture. The first tent
to go up was the kitchen, nnd before the
brace ropes were drawn taut, a row of
stoves were In position and smoke was
issuing from the pipes, am! the steward
and his assistants were hard at work pre
paring breakfa3t. The dining tent was up
almost as soon and men were busy ar
ranging the long tables and benches.
It did not take long to set up the mam
moth tent, for each of the army of men
knew his place and worked with energy.
The center poles for the big tent looked
like masts on an ocean steamer. The
canvas was brought out In sections and
laid on the ground, making a sea of cloth.
Nimble fingers quickly Joined the various
sections until It was all one piece: others
arranged the tent-pole openings; the side
poles were placed In position; the guy
ropes temporarily fastened, and when all
was ready, three teams of horses hauled
away on the main rope and up went tho
biggest tent ever erected In San Fran
cisco.
Tho parade to-day will be well worth
going out of one's way to witness. ThÂ«
RlngUng Brothers' street display has been
pronounced as the best of all. It in said
to have more fascinating color, startling
variety and musical furor than any
other. It Illustrates with abandoned dis
regard of cost all that gives to modern
life the Arabian flavor of opulence. It
shows the really fine horse, sleek ami
well-groomed, and stepping with that
pride of conscious beauty which only a
circus horse can. Twenty-flv* elephants,
gaily bedecked camels, open animal cages,
smartly powned women upon Kentucky
bred horses, an ear-racking clown band,
tableau cars for the little ones, plcturlnsr
fairyland charaetprs. the chime of church
bells, a mounted military band, a steam
calliope, doR-3, ponies. Roatg, clowns In
bizarre drf Â«<Â«*â in fact, about everything
peen or heard of In connection with a cir
cus parade Is attractively evident In this
procession.
Immense Crowds at Circus.
OAKLAND. Sept. 1*.â Rlnjrllng's cirrus
was a revelation to the two Immcusa
crowds that witnessed the enormous show
this afternoon nnd this evening In Oak

An amendment to the constitution was

ship from 175 to 200. The literary pro
gramme occupied the remainder of the
evening, the addresses being on the sub
ject, 'The Present Situation in China. "
Dr. II. Morse Stephens, professor of
modern history in Cornell University, at
i present on the coast delivering a courae
of lectures at the University of Callfor
'â¢ nla, was the first speaker. lie disclaimed
any knowledge of the Chinese question,
but as a student of history he was will
ing to discuss the solutions most generally
proposed in the light of history.
"One set of men!" Professor Stephens
said, "predict the regeneration of China
as Japan was regenerated. Another set
point to India and the- building up of
British empire there as the line of devel
opment to be followed. The historian enrt
explain how India and Japan were trans-
I formed and I s;hall speak on those regen
erations.
"The building up of British empire In
India was the result of a series of acci
dents, and the chief lesson learned by the
British is that, do the best they can, send
their best, yet the people are not so hap
py as under their own rulers and institu
tions If the problem were to be made
over again it is doubtful if Kngland would
undertake it. Still she may on the whole
be proud of the results accomplished.
"By force of circumstances Kngland
was driven into a career of conquest in
India. loiter her adoption of the free
trade principle took away the meaning of
the conquest, and all that was left was
the duty of administration. The task was
there, and In place of commercial defense
came the building up of government and
Anglicizing, not the people, but the ad
ministration.
"Th^ result/of their experiment was the
Indian mutiny, which opened the mlnd3
of Englishmen to the fact that the pqo
ple of jndia did not enjoy the advantages
they were giving them. They did not en
joy the railroad, and telegraph and sani
tation. The Kngiish learned the other
lesson that even Orientals have ideas and
prefer their established rulers and insti
tutions. After the mutiny there was no
more annexation of states. The native
prince is left in nominal power, with a
resident who advises him and prevents
his tyranny from becoming too oppres
sive.
"Unless the natural liking of the Chi
nese for their own customs and Institu
tions be recognized the regeneration of
China is likely to be fraught with grave
dangers. The people are far more homeo
genous than are the people of India and
the Indian mutiny may be outdone. .
"No one can say whether it would be
possible for China to work out its own
regeneration as Japan has done. This
much is certain, China cannot be left to
stew In its own Juice. China cannot lock
itself In and remain the hermit nation.
"The feeling of the Chinese for the In
tegrity of their nation Is strong, and the
proposed partition of it seems monstrous
to me. Let us send them our best and bo
careful we do not send them our worst
men, and it is possible that China may be
as proud of the results as Japan Is to-day.
But it must be a slow transformation."
Ho Yow, Chinese Consul General, was
ill and could not be present to deliver an
address.
Eli T. Sheppard, formerly United States
Consul at Tientsin, was the next speaker.
He gave an outline of Chinese history
since the advent there of foreigners. He
paid many tributes to Secretary of State
Hay and predicted that the powers will
be forced finally to accept the broad, lib
eral policy formulated by the United
Stotes.
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler of the
University of California was the last
speaker. He said among other things:
"I believe profoundly that my country
will not fall to solve the problems con
fronting us. f am not one of those who
are afraid to trust our country to handle
greater problems than she has yet un
dertaken. I do not believe It makes a
man or a nation stronger to avoid re
sponsibility.
"The thingrs that are golntr on now are
not to be reckoned in terms of hauling up
or hauling down the flag. The sovereignty
that prevails now takes no cognizance of
whether Turkey rules in Crete or Samoa.
It is concerned with the facts in the lives
of men and insists only that an artificial
system shall not prevail, but that facts
shall have their validity. So our attitude
in China is a great step toward the ful
fillment of our mission to the world. We
stand for, the principle of giving facts
their sweep, giving to wealth Its protec
tion and to the individual the opportunity
for development."

Prompt Work of Guards and Prison
ers Saves Municipal Buildings
From Destruction.
Fire broke out at Ihe House of Correc
tion yesterday afternoon and for a. time
threatened the destruction of the buildings.
Prompt work on the part of Captain I.
T. -Kincald. superintendent of the prison,
and a corps of guards and prisoners alone
saved the property. Through their efforts
the blaze was held under control until an
engine from Ocean View arrived and ex
tinguished the flames. ,
The blaze originated on the roof of
the north dormitory, in which the women
prisoners are detained. Prisoners were
at work on the roof replacing the asphalt
um with tin. They had half completed
their work and left their flrepot standing
on the unfinished portion while they went
to another part of the building to repair
a break. Sparks were blown out of the
pot and ignited the roof. The dry timbers
burned briskly and threatened to consume
the building. An alarm was given and
the guards and prisoners utilized a small
hose to stay the spread of the flre. In
the meantime a telephone message was
sent to the flrehouse ut Ocean View and
within a short time the engine was on
the scene and the danger was averted.
The female prisoners were not alarmed
by the flre. At the diiectlon of the cap
tain of the jail they were taken into the
yard and when the flrc-was extinguished
were taken to the south dormitory. The
building was damaged to the extent of

Hearing of Petition to Remove Him
as Executor of Henarie's Will
Begins.
The hearing of the order to show cause
why Louis D. Radgesky should not be re
moved as executor of the will of the late
D. V. B. Henarie was taken up by Judge
Coffey yesterday. Mr?. Henarie, dece
dent's widow, charges Hadgesky with mis
appropriation of the tunds of E. Martin
& Co., in which the Henarie estate is a
large stockholder, and for this reason
asked that he be relieved from his trust.
So far as yesterday's evidence Is con
cerned Mrs. Henarie'3 allegations re
mained unproved.
August Muenter, an officer of the cor
poration of E. Martin ."fe Co., testified that
in April Mr. Radgesky did overdraw his
account $1100, but in May he returned $1000
and in June the balance of the overdraft.
Mr. Kadgesky is vice president of the cor
poration and In his capacity as such drew
the money. Joseph Campbell, on behalf
of the respondent, asked that the hearing
be discontinued, for, he said, it was plain
that Mr. Radgesky had not overstepped
his authority. Van R. Paterson objected
to a discontinuance, however, and on
Thursday Alexander G. Bell, cashier of
the corporation, who testified in Radores
ky's favor, will be cross-examined. 'Mr.
Bell has been Instructed to bring the cor
poration books Into court at that time.
An application made by Mrs. Radgesky
for distribution to her of one-half dece
dent's estate was also partly heard; Maud
H. Xorton, decedent's daughter, testified
as to her mother's receipt of a monthly
income of $100 from her father and said
that in addition to this allowance Mrs.
Radgesky frequently received presents of
money from Mr. Radgesky, which she put
In the bank. Further hearing of the case
was continued until Thursday.

DELIRIOUS PATIENT AT THE
COUNTY HOSPITAL JUMPS
AND BREAKS HIS NECK.
FREDERICK KESSLER. an lnmatÂ©
of the" City and County Hospital,
jumped from a window of his ward
on the second floor of that institu
tion yesterday morning: and broke his
neck. His body Is at the Morgrue.
Kessler was taken to the hospital during
the Native Sons' celebration. He was em
ployed at the Palace Hotel as a silver
polisher and enjoyed a reputation for so
briety and honesty, but the spirit of tho
festival entered Into him and he got
drunk. He kept his private celebration go
ing for several days and finally was on tho
verge of delirium tremens. Then at the
lnsiieratlon of friends he was removed to
the Receiving Hospital. There he jvas
given all the treatment that refuge af
tords, but later it was discovered that his
case was more serious than had at first
been supposed and he was ordered sent to
the City and County Hospital.
On the way to the larger institution he
became violent and attempted to -end his
life by beating his head against the sides
of the ambulance, but the attendants re
strained him and he showed no further
suicidal inclination until yesterday morn-
Ing when he was being led by his nurses
from one ward to another. Then he be
came unmanageable. He broke away
from his guardians, beat his head against
the walls and terrorized the other pa

Is a law sufficient to enable constitutional
amendments to be submitted to the peo
ple. They hold that sections 1195 and 1197
of the Political Code contain provisions
sufficient for the purpose. Therefore the
Supreme Court says that the constitu
tional amendments proposed at the regu
lar session of 1S99 may be submitted at
the next general election.
Tho proposed constitutional amendments
that were adopted at the regular legisla
tive session of 1S99 are:
1. A. C. A. No. 6, exempting: church prop
erty from taxation.
2. A. C. A. No. 27. exempting the property
of Stanford University from taxation.
3. A. C. A. No. 14. exempting the California
School of Mechanical Arts (Lick School) from
taxation. â¢ â¢ â¢ .
4. Sen. C. A. No. II, exemptlns State and
county bonds from taxation.
4. Sen. C. A. No. 14. exempting State and
lature to # pass a primary law.
6. Sen. C A. No. 9, rearranging salaries of
Supreme and Superior Court Judges.
7. Sen. C. A. No. 12, establishing Interme
diate courts of appeal.
In tho decision filed yesterday, which
was written by Justice Van Dyke and
concurred In by Justices Garoutte. Hen
shaw and Chief Justice Beatty. it was
held that the Legislature had no right to
propose constitutional amendments at the
extra session and that the two constitu
tional amendments proposed at the extra
session had no vitality and could not be
submitted to the people.
A "new Richmond In the field" played
havoc with tho case. Anderson & Ander
son of Los Angeles, as amicl curiae, filed
a brlet in which they contended that no
amendment could be submitted for the
reason that no law was provided for the
submission of amendments. They claimed
that the law of 1S83 was repealed at the
regular session in 1S99 and that there had
been no law passed since that time under
which amendments could be submitted to
the people. Attorney General Ford re
plied to their brief and contended that the
act of 1SS3 had never been repealed: that
by a legislative blunder the act by which
they tried to repeal It never became a law,
because the bill that passed the two
houses was not the same bill that was
signed by the Governor.
It was "up to" the Attorney General
and he did not shirk the responsibility. It
was the opinion of Mr. tord that the
amendment adopted by the extra session
superseded the one passed by the regular
session ot lbif'J. The matter, however, ap
pealed to Mr. Ford as being of the great
est importance and he suggested to Mr.
Curry that a friendly suit should be in
stituted so that the supreme Court could
pass upon tho dililcult â¢ question. Mr.
Curry was willing, but the Governor
balked. Despite His attitude, however, tho
suit was tiled. The Attorney General
sought to restrain tho Secretary of State
from certifying an amendment proposed
at the regular session. An answer having
been filed to the complaint, the matter
was tried pro forma In the court below.
Judgment was taken against Mr. Ford's
complaint and he appealed. Thomas D.
Uiordan. representing the Secretary of
State, and Tirey L. Ford, representing tha
people, tiled briefs and the cause was sub
mitted.
At the regular session an amendment
covering the same ground- was introduced
and adopted. This was done because
after the adjournment of the regular ses
sion and before the convening of the ex
tra session the framers of the amendment
discovered that there were some changes
that could be advantageously made.
This amendment was manifestly to take
the place of the one proposed at the reg
ular session, but when the Secretary of
State came to certify these amendments
to the various County Clerks as required
by law he discovered the two amend
ments. They were so nearly alike that he
was in a quandary. He therefore wrote
to Attorney General Tirey L. Ford and
asked wnecher he should certify both
amendments to the County Cierks or only
one of them, and if only one, which one.
At the regulax session of the Legislature
in 1899 a constitutional amendment was
proposed looking to the establishment of
an intermediary Court of Appeals to con
sist of three courts, one to sit In perma
nent session at Sacramento, another at
San Francisco and the other at Los An
geles. These courts were intended to re
lieve the Supreme Court of a great deal
of its work, it being impossible for the
Appellate Court to keep up with its cal
endar.
The Supreme Court In its decision yes
terday expressly stated that the consti
tutional amendments passed at the extra
cession were invalid because they were
not included in the proclamation. ,The de
cision Is of widespread interest, as It
ttouches on matters pertaining to the con
stitution of the State. It was based on
the 'friendly suit of the People ex rel.
Attorney General Tirey L. Ford vs. Charles
F. Curry, Secretary of State. The history
of the case and the decision of the high
tribunal is interesting.
Had Governor Gage in his proclamation
named the objects for whiph he called an
extra session of the Legislature the two
constitutional amendments passed by that
body would not have been declared invalid
by the State Supreme Court. His failure
to do so has resulted in an Inferior
amendment going before the people at the
next general election.

nition in the county convention. It Is
a significant fact that a meeting of tho
Democratic Central Committee has
been called for to-day. Too much power.
It is claimed, has been given to the mem
bers of the committee at large. Appre
hension exists that the power delegated to
members at large has been used to sup
3 ress and ignore the rank and file of the
party in San Francisco. In view of the
impending trouble Gavin McNab may bo
Induced to relax In his rulings and per
mit Democrats, other than those fn the
favor of the organization, to participate
In the nominating convention.
There are signs of trouble In the Dem
ocratic camp. Yesterday members of the
Democratic County Committee were ad
vised that a meeting of that body would
be held at Native Sons' Hall to-morrow
evening. The notice contains the sugges
tion that important business will be In
troduced. In explanation of the immedi
ate call for another meeting it Is said that
the time for holding the nominating con
vention is to be changed so that the dele
pates may assemble on September "4. The
catc des'.pna-ted at the recent meeting of
the committee was September 27. The
point Is raised that record of nominations
for the lxsrielaturo must be filed in the
office of the Secretary of State thirty
days prior to the election. Many Demo
cratic lawyers hold that membors of the
Legislature are not State officers within
the meaning of the law relative to filing
notice with the Secretary of State, but to
avoid controversy it was decided to noml
j.ate in time to file the record thirty days
before the election.
It may be well enough for Democrats
who feel that they cannot vote the Re
publican ticket to remain unregistered,
but the Republicans cannot afford to
adopt similar tactics. A full Republican
vote Is demanded. Anti-boss Republicans
should make a epecial effort In every As
sembly district to enroll the full strength
of the Independent vote. Affairs may take
a turn which will require clean Republi
cans to rebuke the bosses at the polU^De
cent Republicans openly proclaim that
they wj;1 not vote to return notorious
boodlers to the Legislature; yet the asso
ciated bosses have planned to renomlnate
Three cf the boodling fraternity.
The eafe course to pursue is for every
unregistered voter to go to the City Hall
and register. The topic of registration
ehou'.d be discussed in the orace, the
workshop and the factory. Plans should
be adopted to ascertain the number of un
registered voters In every establishment
of the city wherein a large number of
men f.nd employment.
Only a limited time remains for voters
to register. The registration is far short
of the normal in Presidential years, and
prompt work is necessary in order to
bring out the full strength of the Repub
lican vote at the November election. The
light enrollment is said to be due to the
Indifference of. Democrats. Merchants,
business men and ethers of Democratic
faith are satisfied with the existing ton
<51tlona cf prosperity and do not wish any
change of national administration: but at
the tame time they do not fancy the Idea
of going to the polls and voting the Re
publican ticket; hence they decline to reg
ister.

It wouid be difficult to determine who arc worse in
the savage, bnrbarmis war being waged in China â -
the Russians or the Chinese. The Russians appear to
have the advantage of more studied deviltry.
Mayor Phclan says, in apology for the eccentrici
ties of the city government, that the charter is not yet
jr. working order. His Honor is mistaken. The
charter is :n working order, but its work is coarse.
Even the Supervisors are not sure that the. charter
of shreds and patches will stand the strain of a test in
the courts. The renffinr.ation of the tax levy adopted
ia June is a deliberate confession of palpable weik
r.ess.

CALIF0RNIANS IN WASHINGTON
FASHION HINT FROM PARIS.
It is probable the Liberals will denounce the disso- !
! lution at this time as a Tory trick, designed to take \
I advantage of the popular satisfaction over the vie- ;
j tories of Lord Roberts, and so obtain a new lease of ,
power. In fact, ever since the first intimation of an
intention to dissolve was given out the t Liberals and
the radicals have been denouncing what they call the
threat of *a "khaki campaign," and the London
Chronicle has greeted the dissolution by a declara
tion: "Lord Salisbury, as he always does, has yielded
to the strong man. He has stifled conscience, thrown*
scruples and justice to the winds, and succumbed to
Mr. Chamberlain, who is now the ruler of the Premier
and the country."
Such an attack from the opposition is natural, yet
ir is hardly justified. The present Parliament could
not live longer than another year at the utmost, and
*ince the British Government has now to undertake
riie pacification and. government- of the conquered
South African republics it is clearly advisable that an
appeal be taken to the people on the new issue and a
Parliament elected which can support a Ministry in
I office long enough to put its policy into effect..
As a matter of fact under ordinary circumstances
the Liberals and the radicals would be only too glad
to have Parliament dissolved, as an* election would
give them a chance at least to get possession of the
Government. Unfortunately at this juncture neither
the Liberals nor their radical allies have .'either a
policy to submit to the country or a leader to make
the campaign for them. They are wholly unprepared
for a fight, and are therefore very deeply indignant
that the Conservatives should force one upon them.
j While the South African problem Will probably be
[the chief subject of discussion during the campaign
\J ICTORIA has signed the proclamation for the
/ dissolution of Parliament, and it is announced
a writ will be issued summoning a new Parlia
'Â¦ ment to meet November 1. The political campaign
in Great Britain, coming on at the same time with
j our own, will illustrate the difference between the po
! litical methods of the two countries. We have al
ready been campaigning very busily for some weeks,
and yet the British will hold their elections, choose
their members of Parliament and get that body to
work a week before our election takes place. More
i over, even after we have elected a new House of Rcp-
I rcsentatives it cannot possibly meet before March 5,
j and is not likely to meet before next November.
I There are many respects in which our system is the
I better of the two, but so far as prompt expression of
i the will of the people is concerned the British plan
j is unquestionably the superior.
THE DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT
the crowd
The transport Lawton will in all truth Be a pauper

as freight rather than as passengers, so great will be
Considered in any and every liprht. strong objec
tions appear to the nmcrdnier!t and nothing to com
mend it. The new courts have not been asked for
by The people and there has been no campaign of
education on the part of the promoters of the scheme
to show reasons why it should be adopted. We end
as we began; the Supreme Court has killed the extra
s-c-HO'.i amendment, and how let the people kill that
ef the rejmlar seteion.
It is hardly nccess try to point out to the people of
California what influences, will be brought to bear
upon the Governor if the amendment be adopted ami
the appointments be in his hands. It is even probable
that the bosses who devised the scheme have already
picked out ihe men they will put into office should
"*Â¦ â¢ â¢ Â¦ v. â¢'
the power be given tpem.
Furthermore it is to be noted the Justices of the
r.<"iv co-.irts are not to be elected by the people in the
first instance, but are to be appointed by the Gov
ernor. It is a sure conclusion that the persons ap
poirMcd will s?ek a nomination when the time comes
for the penple to elect, and, being already in office,
will have an advantage over all competitors. Thus
there will be saddled upon the judicial system of the
nine Judge?, whose tenure of office will be vir
tually by appointment, when the whole spirit of our
people is adverse to that method of selecting such
officials.
There \<- not the slightest need in California for the
proposed courts. Each of them is to have three Jus
tirc = . making nine in ?.H, and in addition there are to
be the usual officers, clerks and stenographers.
Something of expense u-ill therefore be added to the
already high cost nf the State judiciary. Moreover,
the amendment limits the jurisdiction of the Su
preme Court by griving to the proposed appellate
courts some of the authority now possessed by the
fur>reme tribunal. The change will disorder the ju
<r<~i:<l system and for a time at least will lead to an
increase of litigation until the confusion is overcome.
BY the -rlecifion 01 the Supreme Court the con
stitutional amendments proposed at the extra
se>sicm of the Legislature are null and voi<J be
c; use they were not included among the subjects with
which the extra session was called to deal.
The decision settles the amendment proposed at the
extra session creating three appellate courts. There
remains the amendment substantially the same which
tvas pa^sed at the regular session. It will be sub
rcittcd to the popular vote in November. The Su
prcme Court having killed the extra session amend
ment, the people should kill that of the regular ses-
Bion, for both are bad.
THE APPELLATE COURT SCHErtVE
Upon this issue there ought to be no division of
sentiment among the people. What county is there
ill-California that has not within this year lost much
by fires in the" fields, pastures or forests? -What,in
telligent man can consider those losses without per
ceiving the'lesson they teach?
This issue should be kept in the minds of the
voters in every legislative district in the State. There
is no other State issue of the time of so much or
such general importance. The great forests of the
world are being rapidly destroyed. Timber is becom
ing more and more valuable every day. It would pay
California to undertake forest cultivation on an ex
tensive scale. Germany maintains 'about' 10,000,000
acres of State forests on lands unfit for other cultiva
tion, and it is said derives from them an annual rev
enue equal to about $23,000,000. , Yet in Germany
trees do not grow with anything like â¢ the beauty,
strength and profusion that they grow here. By sav
ing her forests Germany derives a' rich revenue,, from
them, but we, by neglecting ours, lose millions of dol
lars instead of gaining them. -
It is safe to say that no reasonable system of pro
tecting our forests will cost the people -of California
one-fourth as much as it costs to have no protection
at all. . Of a course to provide for protection there will
have to be taxes, but no tax that the State will 'deviss
will ever be so ruthless and so disastrous to a com
munity as the tax levied by fire.
By hard work the fire was extinguished and prop
erty saved. That is the record everywhere and in
every instance. The hard work, however, never saves
all the property. There is always a great deal de
stroyed. Credit is given to the men who fight the
fires and save property. Why, then, should there not
be much more credit given to men who will devise
a comprehensive system of forest preservation that
will virtually save it all?
The latest of these burning lessons was reported in
the dispatches from Santa Cruz on Monday, to this
effect: "A forest fire broke out on H. Cowell's
land, east of Big Trees, yesterday and worked toward
the famous grove. This afternoon the fire was re
ported less than a mile from Big Trees. Between the
fire and the trees is a densely wooded country. A
large force of men was out all night fighting the fire.
To-day section men wereadded to the force. A north
wind sprang up 'late this afternoon and turned the
flames away from the direction of Big Trees, but to
night the fire broke out in fresh places and is not -yet
under control. Several hundred men are now fight
ing it. Word was sent to the powder works for help.
The mills immediately shut down and all available
men went to the fire, armed with shovels. The con
flagration is about two miles from the mills. It i3
'expected the men will have it under control by morn
ing."
/~* ALIFORNIA is about to elect a Legislature.
( and that Legislature will be charged with the
duty of providing for California's welfare. As
if for the purpose of illustrating in the most striking
manner what is/her chief need in the way of legisla
tion this winter California is illuminating the cam
paign months with forest fires blazing in rapid suc
cession in all parts of her domain.

Mr. John S. Mosby. San Francisco. Cal.â
â¢Sir: In reply to your letter of the 6th

recently stated publicly that. In his opin
ion, a President, unfriendly to the exist
ing standard of value, would have It In
his power to seriously Injure the business
Interests of the country by paying in
standard silver dollars such obligations of
the United States a3 are not specifically
payable In gold.
The amount of standard silver dollars
available for this purpose at present Is
comparatively small, but it Is believed
that upon indication of a purpose on thÂ«*
part of the Government to disburse them
In preference to gold the amount of pay
ments into the treasury in, sliver would
be largely augmented, thus providing the
Government with additional silver with
wnich to make further payments.
It Is also believed that in the event of
such action unfriendly to the existing
standard the commercial and Industrial
interests of the country would be inju
riously affected, not only by the actual oc
currence, butvby apprenension as to the
final results. Respectfully yours.

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
The Phelanitc administration is at least liberal to
itself. 4/ tcr demanding what it pleased for the con
duct of the various municipal departments it now in
sists that taxpayers shall pay $300,000 more than the
most extravagant demands involved.
A London paper dated August 9. 1900,
gives softie history which the professor
did not mention in his lecture, although
he mentioned the person who he says
invented the tax collector's business in
India, giving these persons full credit for
their intellectuality in the execution of
their civilizing influences. The article re
ferred "to says: "Taxes are still being
diligently collected in the famine-stricken
district in India. Wearing apparel, beds,
plows and small household stores of grain
are seized. In one case a woman was
compelled to undress in the presence of
the collectors that they might see whether
she had anything concealed on her per
son. Floors have been duer up with the
same object, and nothing has own found.
Sick people have been evicted, watchmen
have been placed at the village wells and
people prevented from taking water until
the Government dues were paid. These
sufferers are of course just above the ab

that he thinks It best to keep It to him
self; l. e., the fact of the ownership of
land in British India. Who stole and
swindled the natives out of their land and
made them unable to guard against fam
ine and pestilence, as in the days of the
Rajahs?
The professor should remember that he
is Jn America and net in England, that he
is addressing a people whose fathers have
not yet stolen the Malays' lands, and ho
is, therefore, allowed the privilege of stat
ing the whole truth regarding tne history
of the sad condition of ttiat unhappy
country and its people.
In Java and the other Dutch colonies no
white man is allowed to Â¦ buy land from
the native Malays or other native races.
During the time of Napoleon, when these
Dutch colonies were under English rule
for eight or ten years, the English started
in their land grabbing system, and all the
land taken from the natives bywhite men
was taken " under â¢ English rule, except
some Government land which was the
property of the Government since the
East India Company was established. In
Java 25.000.000 people live in abundance,
while only a quarter of the island is pop
ulated, and the size of Java is not more
than one-third that of California. It was
well for these people that English rule
did not last there or the English land
grabbers would have owned or mortgaged
every bit of good land on the island and
slavery and starvation would have been
tho result.
of a dark situationâ every cloud has its
silver lining, you knowâ I have been able
to live quite placidly. If women could
only be brought to the realization of the
power of the mind we would have more
healthy and happy members of our sex."
Miss Russell is not the only advocate of
the faith cure in the theatrical profession.

this beautiful woman, with everything
that a female heart could desire at her
disposal, should come out in advocacy of
the theory of the superiority of the mind
over matter.
AIRY, FAIRY LILLIAN, WHOSE
FADS MANAGE TO GET INTO
THE PAPERS.
The letter speaks for itself. Republicans should need
no further urging to get their names enrolled upon
the great register. Unless registered, no one can vote.
The citizen who neglects the duty forfeits his fran
chise at the coming election. The issues are impor
tant, for the welfare of the whole country is depen
dent upon the result of the vote for Presidential
electors. All who desire to cast a vote for prosperity
and good government should register at once. .
Citizens should not wait for the last day â Sep
tember 26. Now is the time to avoid the rush. It
takes only a few minutes. Yours very truly,
GEORGE STONE,
Chairman Republican State Committee.
. Editor of The Call: There are a great many
citizens under the impression that because they
voted at the election last November there is no
necessity to register at the coining election. That
is a mistake. All registrations prior to January
1, 1900, have been canceled. The law requires
every citizen to register for the coming election.
The registration office at the City Hall is open
from 8:30 a. m. to 10 p. m.
THE DUTY Cf REGISTRATION.
*
J\* VNY times-of late The. Call has directed the at
/ \ tention of Republicans to the duty of regis
tration, and now comes the following letter
which renews the urging:
P. A. Bergerot, the Kelly chairman of the Repub
lican local convention, owes a solemn duty to him
self. He ought to, take himself into his own confi
dence and learn what everybody else knows â that he
is a creature of the man whoplaced him in the chair.
"This is not a new belief with me," con
tinued Miss Russell. "I have had as much
trouble as any woman, but I have found,
all through my life, that by persistently
concentrating my mind on the bright side
"Of course, I do not believe that I could
wish myself a new arm should I have one
cut off by a Broadway cable car, nor do I
believe that . my mind would be strong
enough to equip me with a new lung
should I fall a victim to the ravages of
consumption. I do not go to these lengths.
But I do say that we are too prone to drug
ourselves and that the- mind is in such su
preme control that the ordinary Ills of life
can be cured by thought concentration.
"When I am fatigued and would fain
seek rest when I should be at work, I
simply insist to myself that I am fresh
and strong, and, lo, I become fresh and
strong at once. By concentrating my mind
on the undertaking I have cured hic
coughs when all other known remedies
have failed.
"I have noticed, however," she said yes
terday, during an Intermission In the
"Weber & Fields matinee, "that when I
get headaches I am able to get rid of
them by simply concentrating my mind
on the proposition that I have no head
ache. This, in connection with some
bromo seltzer and smelling salts, never
fails to relieve tfne.
At the outset, says a writer In a New
York paper, it may be said that Miss Rus
eell has never been seriously ill in her
life, and that her health at the present
time is so good that she is almost
ashamed of herself. It is. hard Indeed for
a woman to work as many as two hours
a day on a hot, stuffy stage and be un
able to produce a single pain. Even on
days when there is a matinee M(ss Rus

bodily aches and pains.

question of religion Lillian Russell has
announced to her friends. that she Is an*
out-and-out faith curist. She does not
subscribe to the doctrines of Mrs. Eddy,
of the Christian Science cult, in their en
tirety, but so strongly Is she convinced of

LILLIAN RUSSELL'S NEW
BRAND OF FAITH CURE
Boardman Michael Robinson showg in
the same gallery an Interesting study of
the gardens of St. Cloud, near Paris. It
is a good example of the school at present
so popular in Franceâ the low toned, re
served, synthesized method; a little mor
bid perhaps, but with a deep and tender
reach into the darkness after new and
elusive truths that art yet holds in her
capricious hands.
in another gallery are some fascinating:
etchings of Evert Van Muydenâ"anlma
lier." as he styles himself. This young
animal painter-etcher is rapidly acquir
ing fame in his chosen line, and the two
specimens of his work in question, a cou
ple of studies of the black panther, are
fine examples of hia quick, sensitive and
spirited pencil. He has admirably caught
the character of the fierce, agile and cow
ardly brute, its cruel strength and lithe
beauty.
A passing glimpse of the new Sloss pos
session reveals a delicious symphony in
moonlight, a red-roofed adobe cottage,
with flame-lit window? shadowed by a
solitary pine, and over all the still, cool,
limpid moonlight. The picture Is like
a Stevenson sketch in paint, fuJJ of the
romance and mystery of night, richly
suggestive, and true with, a truth tnat
touches almost to tears. It is eminently
simple in subject, composition and hand
ling.
By way of this, a fair art critic hear
ing mention of Mr. Peters' name in the
gallery where for an accidental moment

On being directed to the gaUery she fixed
her critical gaze admiringly on a neigh
boring moonlight confectionâ all frills of
froth on the wavelets and with awan

shone on sea or land â and said enthusias
tically, "I should know a Peters wherever
I saw It!"
In the same gaUery is an ambitious
child portrait, life size, painted by N.
Moller, whose two portraits of John Fer
ry Jr. are still to be seen there. His is a
curious, careful, obvious method, entirely
without subtlety, originality or distinc
tion. As a likeness the portrait is proba
bly good, the model is certainly "pretty,
but the child is posed about as wrongly
as the most vivid imagination could con
ceive. The line of the curtains which
form the background cuts clean through
the child's head, the arms hang stiffly by
the sides and their line of continuation
would carry them exactly parallel with
two equally stiffly posed black-stockinged
limbs below.

announces "an exhibition and sale

mond D. Yelland at the Mark Hop-
ART AND ARTISTS.
Such is the programme Bryan proclaims in his let
ter of acceptance. What intelligent man on that show
ing can consider the Philippine question to be the
paramount issue before the people? So long as the
industrial prosperity and financial integrity of the na
tion is menaced by a party demanding free trade and
free silver, so long will that menace be the chief issue
before the voters. As President McKmley has said,
"Another issue may be paramount, but this is imme
diate." Â¦
In commenting upon Roosevelt's letter of accept
ance on Monday morning the Examiner said; "Gov
ernor Roosevelt is Very sure that we ought not . to
have the free coinage of silver. It is believed, al
though space was lacking to dwell upon it, that he is
equally opposed to the Ptolemaic system of astron
omy, the Virginia and Kentucky resolutions and the
Lecompton constitution of Kansas." Those were gay
and galliard words, but now comes Bryan in his let
ter of acceptance and commends the action of the
Kansas City convention because, among other things:
"The platform reiterates the demand contained in the
Chicago platform for an American financial system
made by the American people for themselves. The
purpose of such a system is to restore and maintain a
bimetallic level of prices, and in order that there may
be no uncertainty as to the method of restoring bi
metallism the specific declaration in favor of free and
unlimited coinage at the existing ratio of 16 to i in
dependent of the action of other nations is repeated."
The struggle for the standard of value is^not the
only bygone contest which Bryan revives, Tie an
nounces an opposition to the Dingley' tariff hardly
less determined than that to the gold standard.
Should he be elected the fiscal policy of the nation
is to be once more made the subject of Democratic
tinkering and the whole commercial and industrial
system to be disturbed. Furthermore, he an
nounces a direct antagonism to the recent currency
and banking legislation. Thus his election to the
Presidency would mean an overturn of all the bases
on which our prosperity rests. It would be a revolu
tion affecting every trade and every home in .the
country.
Alas for those who put their trust in Bryan! The
wmdy man who but a short time ago promised com-'
pliance with the plan'of ignoring silver is now to the
front waving the free silver and the free trade banner
with all his might and shouting for it with all his
lungs.
For supine time past the Democratic leaders and
their organs have been trying to put the money ques
tion aside and to deceive the public into a belief, that
the free coinage of silver is not an issue in this cam
paign. For a time Bryan gave encouragement to the
trick and kept silent about silver. A short time ago
when a correspondent of the New York Herald asked
him whether if elected President he would pay in sil
ver all the obligations of the Government not speci
fically payable in gold he refused to answer the ques
tion. Gaining confidence by that action of their
leader, the orators and the organs of Bryanism be
came bolder in scoffing at the financial question. They
ridiculed any suggestion that such an issue is before
the people, and firmly took their stand upon the
declaration that the one issue of the time is the "para
mount issue" of imperialism.
BRYAN'S letter of acceptance is nothing more
than a wordy and windy expatiation upon the
various planks of the Kansas City platform.
With a degree of moderation remarkable in him,' he
put aside whatever inclination he may have had to
write big words about the "paramount issue," and,
after declaring he had said enough on that subject in
his notification speech, he passed on to a considera
tion of the remaining pledges of his party. Of course
he indorses and promises to uphold every declaration
of the Kansas City convention, and the only notable
passages in his letter are those in which he reaffirms
his opposition to the gold standard and the protective
tariff.
BRYAN'S flCCEPTfiNCE.
Altogether the election is going to be a most im
portant one, and the result will have an influence
upon the development of British policies at home and
abroad which will be felt for years. to come,
An interesting feature of the campaign will be the
course taken by the labor organizations. British
workingmen, like those of other countries, have
hitherto been divided between the two great parties,
but lately efforts have been made to form a Labor
party, to act, as the Irish party has done, as a distinct
organization for the purpose of carrying out a defi
nite programme of legislation. Should that move
ment prove effective it is quite likely the historic
Whig party will go to pieces, the conservative mem
bers of the organization going over to the Tories,
while the radicals will affiliate with the workingmen.
there are many domestic issues that will have to be
met. One of these is a demand for a redistribution of
seats in Parliament, ethers are involved in various
measures* of reform advocated by workingmen, and
there will be of course more or less attention given
in many constituencies to the inevitable Irish ques
tion.

other Flemish, Italian and English paint
ers, many of them of the best. Tho Amer
ican painters, both of the earlier set and
the more modern men. are moderately
well represented, though other galleries
contain more complete collections. Still
there is a good showing, particularly of
the men who flourished from the early
'30s to the late '60s. A fine portrait of Mr.
Marquand by John S. Sargent must be
noted, and there are two masterpieces by
the late Georee Inness. The sculpture Is
of a historical Interest, rather than ar
tistic, although there are not wanting
many good pieces. Among the donors has
been the late Miss Catherine Wolf, who
bequeathed to the museum all the pictures
In her galleries, together with the sum of
1200,000 with which to maintain and In
crease the collection. The museum is ac
cessible to the public, and there are no
restrictions whatever, while every facility
Is offered to the student to familiarize
himself with its treasures.
The year 1870 seems to have been a
propitious time for the founding of mu
seums or their enlargement. The Metro
politan and the Boston museums j were
organized in that year, and Congress dur
ing the same year chartered the Corcoran
Gallery of Art. which was made possible
through the liberality of the great phil
anthropist. William W. Corcoran. In this
year the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine
Art. finding It had outgrown the propor
tions of its old building, arranged for a
new site. This institution had its first
building in Chestnut street, Philadelphia,
destroyed by fire In 1S15. Its present abode
in Broad street dates from the centennial
year. A large proportion of the $500,000
which it cost was subscribed by about 15'i
business houses and private citizens In
sum ranging from $1000 to $10,000, mainly
through the untiring exertions of James
L. Claghorn, then president of the insti
tution.
In 18S6 a J10O.O00 endowment fund wa9
subscribed, and this has since been In
creased by $02,000. of which $71,000 was left
by George S. Pepper, ninth president of
the academy. Edward L.. Cary. fourth
president; Henry C. Gibson, a vice presi
dent, and Joseph E. Temple, a director of
the academy, have left collections and
funds, while the Field collection, from a
traits, compositions, landscapes, copies of
old masters and heads, together with
sketches, unfinished oils, studies In sepia,
chalk and many drawings. Most Inter
esting and valuable are th* canvases by-
Gilbert Stuart, than which no gallery has
po complete a collection. Unquestionably
the most notable of these is the famous
"Athenaeum" head of Washington, which
was painted from life in 17'.Â»>. and which
is familiar through reproductions of all
sorts. There is also a portrait of Martha
Washington, which was painted at tho
same time, as well as the portrait of
"Washington at Dorchp?ter Heights, which
Stuart is said to have painted in nine
days.
Noteâ This study, by Arthur Hoeber of
New York, will be concluded on Wednes

The late Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes
once said that "to have a portrait in the

tonians a trade-mark of respectability."
Here may be seen likenesses of many
prominent people. Including (lenorat War
ren. John Hancock. Samuel ami John
Quincy Adams and many others. NTU
urally, of course, the late "William M.

THE contractors are losing no time
In getting ready to blow up Arch
Rock. The Booner that job .is over
the sooner will they get their final
payment from Uncle Sam. The final
payment Is what they are looking for,
and upon the length of time it takes to
get It depends their profit or loss.
More explosives will/ be used in the
blowing- up of Arch Rock than the com
bined amounts used in blowing up Shag
Rock and Shag Rock No. 2. The rend
ing force of the powder will be terrific,
but the chances are that the concussion
will not be any greater than on either
of the former occasions.
Arch Rock haB been a menace to navi
gation ever since the days of '49. and even
though the people of SausaJlto object to
Its destruction because it Is one of the
Eights of the bay, still tfie pilots call it
a "dangerous spot" and they say it should
have been removed long ago.
"When they come to survey that spot,"
eaid. Pilot Frank Boyd yesterday, "they
will find every Inch of ground in the
vicinity 'of Arch Rock covered with an
chors and chains. Coasters and deep
water ships by the hundred have come
within an ace of going on the rock and
had to slip lheir anchors in order to get
clear. "The anchor, chain and hawse
pipe picked up- by the Sea \" King on
Monday was not that of thÂ© Autocrat. It
belonged to the old American ship High
lander. The Highlander was making port
early In 1S61 and drifted down on Arch
Rock In a fog. The anchor was let .go
and it held too well, tearing the hawse
pipe out of the ship and nearly all of the
bow of the ehlp with it. The Highlander
was afterward got o/f and her cargo was
saved.
"The first vessel that I remember being
wrecked on Arch Rock," continued Cap
tain Boyd, "was the pilot boat Sea Witch.
That was in 1S55. All the pilots had
'boarded oft' and the schooner was com
ing in in charge of the boat-keeper.
There was a dense fog and the boat
keeper mistook Arch Rock for a sloop
under sail and getting his course accord
ingly made the mistake of his life. All
hands were saved, but the Sea Witch was
a total loss.
"The next wreck was that of the clip
per ship Flying Dragon In the winter of
1861-62. She made i.ho fastest run on rec
ord from Newcastle, N. S. W., 35 days,
and anchored off Meiggs wharf. Captain
Watson, the well known marine surveyor,
was in command of the vessel, but the
jilot was etill In charga when the acci
dent happened. A eudaen change of wind
and a flerca squall drove tne- Flying
Dragon dawn on the Rock and she be
came a total loss.
"The next vessel lost on the rock was
the baik Autocrat In 1*69. She was loaded
with coal and drifted down to her doom
In a dense fog. Since that time number
less, vessels have made the acquaintance
of Arch Rock and -always to their disad
vantage. The old ferry-boat Clinton went
on one of its ledges in a fog and the
steamer Oregon, now running between the
Sound and N'ome. loet her bilges on it.
The old bark Corumbia stuck on It for a
day and a night, and last of all, the bark
Ceylon drifted down on it a few months
ago and was saved by the quarantine
eteamer Sternberg. As it was, the Cey
lon lost all her sheathing. It would take
a page to give the number of vessels that
have just escaped going on Arch Ruck
by slipping their cables, and when the
contractors come to boring I'll guarantee
they will find more chain and anchors
than rock."
In the old days it was a favorite amuse
ment for the young men of North Beach
to wait for a very low tide and then pull
a boat through under the arch. Captain
Frank Murphy, one of the best known of
the pilots, pulled a Whitehall through the
arch in 1857. Two of the crew of the pilot
boat Golden Gate pulled a yawl through
in 1S59, and then a couple of years later a
couple of men tried to repeat the trick,
but a heavy swell was rolling in through
the Golden Gate and they were crushed
against the top of the arch. Since that
time rowboats nave kept away from Arch
Rock.
It haa often been suggested to have a
lighted buoy on Blcssora Rock and Pre
ridio Shoal. Blossom Rock having only
j<H4 fcÂ»t on it and Presidio Shoal only 14&
feet at low water. It might be said that
when lights on Alcatras or Yerba Buena
or North Head arid Fort Point can be seen
there is no reason for getting cloRe to
these dangers, but when the curtain of fog
falls suddenly at night after passing In
side the Heads there isnot much time to
choose positions, especially on a flood tide.
Three Vessels in Collision.
The schooners Guide and Premier ar
rived from coast ports Monday night.
The wind fell light as they were sailing
up the bay, and off Folsom street they
came together. Both schooners drifted
down or. the naval resarye steamer Ma
rlon, but no damage waft done to her; but
the little ship Portsmouth that was used
in the parade and was riding beside the
old sloop-of-war was dismasted. Later
the tup Ida W cleared the vessels and
took the Premier to Mission Bay. The
Guide, left to herself, drifted down on the
cuble. and all of yesterday, communica
tion with Oakland by telephone was stop
ped. Damage to all the vessels except
the Portsmouth was light.

Of an earlier date is the far-famed
"Horse Fair," by Hosa Bonheur. familiar
through engravings and prints from one
end of the country to the other, and it is
a wofk that will never grow stale, for it
has big qualities, both In painting and
drawing, as well as in conception. Here,
tod, are all of the Barbizon school of
painters, with many examples each, and
the. popular men, such as Bouguereau,
Cabanel, Gerome, Corot. Henner, L'Her
mltte, Le Febvre, Lerolle and Vibert, to
name only a few. Munkacsy, Muller.
Knaus, Hans Makart and others â Ger
mans, Austrians and Italians â may also
be studied through a long and compre
hensive list. Earlier back we have the
great Constable, who may be said to be
the father of the French school of the
"men" of 1830," as they are called, who
were bo attracted by the work of this
distinguished English painter and the re
markable colorist. Turner, beloved^ of
Ruskin, whose writings helped to draw
attention to the man. By him there are
two important examples, and then we go
further back to the distinguished group
of Georgian painters. Often referred to a^
the "Early Englishmen," sturdy portrait
ists and painters of our ancestry acros3
the sea. Virile old Sir Joshua Reynolds,
sturdy Raebum, brilliant Gainsborough
and â¢ suave Lawrence, Hoppner, Romney
and all the rest of them may be seen and
analyzed.
Mr. Marquand has given a whole room
ful of old masters, including a sumptuous
Itembrandt. the "Portrait of a Man." and
other work: the remarkable full length
by Van Dyke of James Stuart. Duke of
Richmond; a Velasquez, a Rubens, Hol
bein. Leonardo da Vinci and many more,
making a really wonderful collection.

daughter of Richard Peters Jr.. one of
the founders of the academy, has also
been added. The late John S. Phillips
bequeathed some 40,000 enpravlnsa and
etchings, together with an endowment of
512,000 for the care and the increase of the
i collection. The academy has a. very com
prehensive collection of American work,
beginning; with that of Benjamin Wesr.
whose "Death. on a Pale Horse"* 13 here;
continuing with Gilbert Stuart, who H
represented with more than twenty por
traits. Including what is claimed to be the
original of the famous Lansdowne por
1 trait of "Washington. Among the modern
Americans there are excellent examples
by William M. Hunt. John S. Sargent.
Alexander Harrison. Thomas Eakin*.
'Wlnslow Homer. John W. Alexander.
William M. Chase. Thomas Shields Clarke.
George de Forrest. Brush and Cecilia

work is held annually in the galleries.- and
its collections and schools are among the
most Important in the country.
It was not until 1S79 that the Boston
Museum of Fine Arts came to occupy Its
present quarters in Copley square, and In
the twenty-one years that have elapsed
sir.ee then Its collections have so rapidly-
Increased that land has been acquired
on Huntington avenue, near the Fens.
where it is proposed to erect a large and
imposing structure. Among its other
funds is the sum of $750,000 left by Henry
L. Pierce, which la quite unrestricted. In
deed, most gbod Bostonitxna who die in
possession of wealth, !f they do not pro

something, as a rule, to the Museum of
Fine Arts.
It was eminently fitting that so thor
oughly American a city a.i Hoston should
have in its museum a line collection of
native work, and special attention has
been given to the early painters, the col

CHICAGO, Sept. 18.â Wheat opened nervou*
and easier. October at 76%c to 76%c, because
of Liverpool's^ failure to respond to the ad
' vance here yesterday and because the pre
dicted rains for the Northwest failed to ma
terialize. There waa a considerable amount
of profit-taking at the start, but the offerings
were well taken and the market gradually
Â¦worked up to 77%c. Bradstreet's report of an
increase in the world's visible of 5,118,000
bushels caused more selling later, but mean
time the Northwest markets had turned strong
and the stuff was readily absorbed. When
ehorts tried to get back some of their sales
they found a %-ery stiff array of holders and
the price was bidden sharply up to 77Â»ic. Tht
close was firm, October %@%c higher at 77?4
@77%c.
Corn was dull and devol dof speculative in
terest. October closed He higher at 38%c.
Corn was dull and devoid of speculative in
trade mestly local. October closed a shade
down at 21%@21%c. - , v
The demand for lard was the feature in the
provision market. The small stocks of this
commodity caused covering by shorts and as
packers were also buyers the market advanced.
October pork closed lGÂ©12%c over yesterday,

Nav York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Sept. IS.â The Â»tock market i
demonstrated Its inertness again to-day ana j
the effort to continue yesterday's course 0* j
recovery fell flat. Prices were at one tlm<j |
advanced considerably above last night's level, i
but they did not hold and the closing showed Â¦
some of the gains completely wiped out and
fome reduced to small proiwrtlons. The re
ported failure of a Stock Exchange houss had
a depressing effect, although the suspension j
seems to be due entirely to private causes.
About 2iÂ«iO shares of stock were sold under j
the rule for the account of the suspended firm i
on the exchange and the quotations for some i
of the Ftocks sold wire considerably depressed. I
They recovered somewhat after the selling un
der the rule wae completed, but in the late
dealings Consolidated Gas was forced down I
again and sold 2* 4 under the high price. La
clede Gas fell as rr.ueh. London was Inclined I
to buy stocks in the market . notwithstanding
the general depres-sion in that market and
the demand from that source was a factor In
the early rise in that market. The expecta
tion that a portion of the American subscrip
tions to the German loan will be paid by the j
transfer of sterling exchange bills helped to 1
weaken the London market. The strength of !
Americans in that market in spite of the gen
eral weakness and of the further rise in dis
count rates was a distinction for that group
cf securities. The New York market showed
a. hardening tendency and call loans com
manded I** per cent Time loans were also !
more firmly held.
The bond market was dull and irregular in
sympathy with stocks. Total sales, par value.

CLOSING.
NEW YORK. Sept. 18. â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablfgTam says:
The tone of the markets here was heavy to
day, mainly because of the scarcity of busi
ness and because of the expectation that the
Parliamentary elections -will divert attention
until they are over. The America.n department
was an exception, professionals buying in the
belief that yesterday's slump was largely
caused by manipulation. New York offered
support and the close nas at the best prices.
Tintos were lower, Paris showing a weak
tendency. Call money was easy and discounta

Objects to the Occupation of the

Railway.
Cor-yrlBht. 1300, by Associated -rress.
TIENTSIN, Sept. 17.â It is understood
that the British authorities have been in
structed to oppose Rigorously the Rus
sian occupation of the Shanhal-Kwan and
Tientsin Railway, which Is owned by a
British syndicate and leased to the Chi
nese. The recent Russian movements
northward are believed here to Include an
expedition to Shanhai-Kwan, which Is
now held by the Imperinl troops. Both the
British and Americana have an eye on
Shanhal-Kwan as'an open- winter port.
Only a few miles of the railway have
been destroyed and the bridges are In
tact. A British expedition to Shanhal-
Kwan is probable at an early date.
Brigadier General Humphrey, chief
quartermaster of the United States expe
ditionary force, and Colonel Samuel S.
Sumncr have arrived here. The latter will
command the second brigade.

lead to-.the establishment of another gov
ernment In Slanfu.
Other Shanghai dispatches say that the

General, Yuan She Kai, Is unable to sup

Citizens Are Somewhat Dilatory In
Jbecuring Their Right to

Ther^ remain but seven days In which
citizen? may register their names to vote
at the next Presidential election. Regis
trar Walsh calculates that there are 17.000
voters yot to be placed on the roll, taking
the registration of 1K*>. which was In
round numbers 71000, as a basis. Monday
last a total of PÂ»T) names were enrolled,
but yesterday the registration fell to 500.
Precinct registration is also very light,
only 6000 names having been added to the
roll on the last two Saturdays, or an
average of less than twenty to a precinct.
Next Saturday will be the last day to
register in the precincts and September
26 the last day to register at all. The
office at the City Hall will remain open
continuously from S:30 a. m. until 10 p. m.
Voters who have registered since January
1. 1900. and have moved !n the meantime

Is for new additions to the roll, thougn
this may also be done at the City Hall.

IL TROVATORE." the favorite old
Verdi cpera, which Is alternating this
week with "Faust" at the Tlvoll

fore a crowded house.
The cast Is again a particularly fortun
ate one, Including Russo as Manrlco. Fer
rari as the Count di Lura, Effle Stewart
as Leonora and Lla Polltlni as Axucena.
Last evening It was the turn of Ferrari
to Furprise the audience. He has certain
ly done no such good work this reason as
his Count dl Luna. The "Anguish of My
Heart" was given with fine effect, and
Â¦was notably free from the tremolo which
has of late been marring this most ex
cellent voice. Russo was of course splen
did as the Manrlco, acting and singing
alike, and Schuster's bass did good work
In the part of Ferrando.
The part of Leonora iÂ« well taken by
Miss Stewart, even partially well acted,
but if only this flno dramatic soprano
could act as well as she> can sing, few.
Indeed, on the operatic stage could equal
her. Polltini's Azucena Is good all
through. Her make-up Is excellent, and
her sympathetic contralto finds ample op
portunities in the role. The "SI la
Stanchezza" duet, sung with Russo in the
last act, was most beautifully given.

The boycott upon Justice of the Peace
J. G. Qulnn, which has deprived him for
the past two months of most of his emol
uments of office has been declared off.
Harmony again prevails in the temple of
justice at the southwest corner of Broad

vations are made Constables "Weidler and
Williamson will return to their old quar
ters to He down peacefully like the lion

The terms of agreement upon which the
return to harmony has been arranged are
a secret among the parties in' interest.
Neither the Justice nor the Constables
care to make public that feature of the
restoration of amicable relations. They
are content to say the war Is over, and
that hereafter Judge Qulnn will receive
the fees of office, which for sixty days
have flowed Into the pockets of Justice
Lame of East Oakland. What Is Justice
Quinn's gain will be the loss of the Judge

It Is estimated that the boycott cost
Justice Qulnn not less than $600 In fees.

by the Constables since they declared
war. At $3 a head It Is manifest a tidy

HON. CHARLES A. TOWNE
TO SPEAK IN OAKLAND
have absolutely forbidden any disturb
ance, still fearing the efTect of the Revere
shock. Dr. Kergan said to-day:
"Mrs. Klier is in a very dangerous condi
tion because of the internal injury from
inhalation of smoke and tlames. She Is
semi-conscious, but Is delirious tho
greater part of the time. I think that the
crisis will come during the next forty
eipht hours, although she may succumb
before that. The children will, in my
judgment, recover. Their burns are very
severe but they seem to have rallied
some from the shock. The cases appeal
to one because of the family's destitute
condition. While they owned the place
that was burned, they are greatly In need
of temporary assistance,"
Mrs. Charles Webber, who opened her
home to the sufferers, said: "We have
given them the best accommodations we
have, but the Injured children should be
removed to a place better adapted to
their care. Mrs. Kller Is, of course, In no
lly Is receiving the best of attention at
the hands of Df. H. S. Kergan.
They are absolutely destitute. Every
thing they possessed was either stolen by
the burglars who, the police say. caused
the fire or is in ashes in the destroyed
dwelling. The children are without a ves
tige of clothing, save the nightpowns
which they wore. There was not a dol
lar's worth of goods saved from the fire.
On top of the calamity Is the danger
that the father. Franz Kller, will " bÂ«
dri\en insane by the shock from the dis
aster. For many months he had been se
riously ill and had been compelled re
cently to go to San Francisco to get away
from the malarial conditions at home.
Friends broke the news to him late last
night, and he was nearly frantic with
grief and fear for the condition of his
family. He could not reach them until
this morning. He found his wife and chil
dren swathed from head to foot In band
ages and unable to speak. The doctors

condition to be moved."
Fire Warden Lawton made a thorough
examination of the ruins to-day. His
opinion is that the fire was started by
the burglars who were frightened away
by the unexpected home-coming of Mrs.
Klier. Said l-awton:
"The fire started at the foot of the back
stairs, the only means of communication
with the second lloor, where were the
mother and children. An open window
upstairs created a draught through this
funnellike stairway. When Mrs. Kiler
opened the door to escape fames must
have struck her and forced her back. I
wonder anybody escaped. It looks very
much as If the burglars wererespons'ble for
the fire. We could find no trace of any ex
ternal cause. The fire started inside am}
In a corner, as if a match or bit of candle
had been thrown there and laid until it
set the woodwork and carpets ablaze." .
Bf sides tho jewelry which was stolen a
considerable sum of money which was
hidden in a pewing machine drawer is
missing. Tho Kliers had been saving as
siduously toward the building of a new
home in a more healthy portion of tho
city Franz Kller. the father, is an ex
pert on brass Instrument manufacture,
and for many years has been employed
by Sherman. Clay & Co.
"To my wife's brave action and her
rjulck-wittedness I owe the lives of my
children," said the husband as he
gazed upon the ruins of his home that
had cost him many years of toll to gain.
"I care nothing for the loss of my home,
but I pray that my wife and babies will
recover. All that was left them was to
face death in the flames or to take the
desperate chance of a plunge from the
house to tho ground. I am thankful they
were not killed by the fall."
Mrs. Kller kep"t her presence of mind
throughout the awful ordeal. Bhe first
tossed out a big feather mattress and
then tried In the darkness to toss her
children upon it. Ottilia's, arm was
broken by striking on the front stairway
entrance as she fell. Except for their
bums this wns the only external Injury
any of the four sustained.

In the battle to escape from the dwelling

FROM EFFECT OF BURNS
Oakland Office San FVanciscO' Call.
111S Broadway. Sept. 1*.
Because, she 1? a victim of epilepsy. 12
year-old Carrie Ja< k*on may he excluded
from the public schools of Ahmoda Coun
ty. This U the decision of Chief Deputy
Dlstrict Attorney Philip It Walsh, who
has prepared n report which he will pre
sent to thft Board of Trustees of Fruti
valÂ«* School District at its next meeting.
According to the Deputy District Attor
ney, the pr^por.ce of tho afflicted child In
th*Â» schoolroom prevents the Rood order
which Is essential for advantaRPoua edu
cation and discipline. The breach of dis
cipline lies in the fact that the peace and
decorum o' Carrie Jackson's fellow pupils
are disturbed every time she is stricken
with a fit and that the .stuiii^s of the class
are Interrupted. Some of the children are
thrown into a hisrhiy nervous state tn con
sequence of heinp compelled to view the
paroxysms of the Jackson child and hear
hf>r agonizing cries.
"The question at Issue." states the Dep
uty District Attorney, "is whether the
condition of the child Is such fist to war
rant her suspension from school until shÂ«
may recover." The following section of
the Political Code is quoted by him:
Every school, unless oth*rwl?<Â» provided by
law, must be op^n fnr th* Â«*ducation of all
children tx^tw^n 8 and 21 yÂ«Â»arsÂ» of aef r?Â«tdlnÂ«t
tn the district, ami thÂ» Board of Trustees or
the City FSoard of Education have power to ad
mit aduits and children n"t residing In tha
district whenever good rÂ«a*t->n exists therefor.
Trustees *ha,ll have power to exclude children
of nithy or vic'.-us habits nr chlMren suffering
from contastous or Infectious diseases.
In explanation of the code Deputy
Walsh pays:
â¢"The foregoinp is limited to some ex
tent by section K17 of the Political Cod<Â».
which Rivea the Tni3tees of school dis
tricts and the Boards of Education power
'to prescribe and enforce rules not incon
sistent with law or those prescribed by
the State Board of Education for their
own government and the government of
school3.' "
The decision In the Jackson case holds
with court<Â« of last resort that the right
to attend school is not absolute, but one.
to be enjoyed by all under reasonable con
ditions.
"I therefore advise you," conclude* the
report, "that th<Â» circumstances of this
case axe such that you have power tn en
force a rule suspending or excluding chil
dren like the child in question, but. l!kfÂ»
the exercise of power in other cases, such
suspension or exclusion is Justified by thÂ©
emergency and like the necessity which
gives rise to It ceases when the necessity
ceases."

William A. Plummer. the Alameda soci
ety man who a few days ago filed suit
against his young wife for a legal separa
tion, could not put up with his spouse's
cooking. Though the divorce complaint
alleges desertion, the primary cause of
the trouble between the coup;e was their
frequent quarrels over the viands pre
pared by Mrs. Plurr.mer's dainty hands.
Mrs. Plummer in her answer to her
husband's suit admits that she left him.
but says she was compelled to because of
their frequent quarrels over the dinner
table. In fact, the trouble began at
breakfast, increased at luncheon and cul
minated in the evening.
According to the fair defendant, every
thing fhe cooked was "hash" to Plummer.
Her husband took particular antipathy to
her "stew." II she prepared what she
considered an especially appetizing dish to
iTnpt hubby after bis day's work he
would declare it a "nasty m*^9" and ask
her who taught her how to cook. When,
She broiled a steak he stormed because
she did not have chops.
But the unklndpst cut of all was when
Plummer turned tip hia nose at the stew.
>frÂ«. Plummer states that she put up
with her husbnnd's frank criticisms* of
her culinary efforts until she could stand
them no longer and then went home to
he- relatives. She denies the charge of
desertion on her part and prays for a di
vorce en the ground of her hu3bard's de
sertion of her. She claims the custody of
the minor child. Phyllis J. riummer.
The couple are well known in Alameda.
Plummer is Interested In the Crystal Salt

of Attorney J. C\ Bates, who represents
her in the divorce case.

the Pythian Castle, which was attended
by a large number of the friends of the
members of the organization. A first-class
entertainment was provided and all en-
Joyed the many numbers presented as a
close of the semi-centennial celebration
inaugurated by the Native Sons. The
committee, of which R. C. Kelly was the
chairman and M. R. Japer secretary, has
reason to congratulate itself on the suc
cess of the smoker. The committee hand

HOTEL ARRIVALS.
The different organizations of retail
clerks are working to educate the public
to the idea "that afternoon trade Is best
for all," and to accomplish this they have
secured the co-operation of the labor
unions of this city, backed up by the Na
tional Federation of - Labor.
The preliminary work was done by E.
Rosenberg, secretary of the San Fran
cisco Labor Council, who addressed his
audience and made plain the benefits to
be had through organization. He was fol
lowed by J. K. Jones, member of the Re
tall Shoe Clerks Association and delegato
from that organization to the Lcbor
Council, who pointed out in a masterly
manner the opportunities within the grasp
of the clerks provided they organized. J.
C. Carter, president of the shoe clerks
organization, told at length of the de
cided improvement in the conditions sur
rounding the shoe clerks since their or
ganization "two weeks before July 1L"
The call 'for signatures and payment of
assessments brought every man In the
hall to the secretary's desk. The enthu
siasm and desire for progress through or
ganization as shown by those present
should ultimately lead to a successful end-
Ing of the campaign for shorter hours.
The San Francisco Labor Council Issued
a call to the retail clerks of this city to
meet at 102 O'Farrell street last night
which met with an enthusiastic response.
Temporary organization was entered Into,
with a membership of seventy-live, rep
resenting the various departments of the
largest stores.
Their Object Is to Persuade the Pub
lic That to Buy In the Afternoon
Is Best for All Con-
Retail Clerks Form a New
and Most Enthusiastic
Organization.

Fifty-two bright young men and women
are about to petition the Board of Re
gents of the University of California not
to cut them off from the advantages they
have enjoyed In the matter of prosecuting
the study of the Cantonese branch of the
Chinese language. . A meeting will be
called In a few days to. take the necessary
steps. There is an instructor in Can
tonese in the university who was recom
mended by Dr. Freyer and appointed upon
Dr. Freyer's representations. Now these
fifty-two young men and women say that
Walter Fong, the appointee, is a See Yup,
as they are credibly informed,' and that
he is not fe. Cantonese. Therefore, they
have refused to a man and woman to en
ter Walter Fong's new class, on the
ground that he Is not competent to teach
them the commercial dialect of Southern
and Eastern China, They have all been
studying Cantonese between one and two
years and many or' them hold certificates
from the University of California, show
ing their progress to be Â¦ creditable.
Incidentally much bitter talk: is heard
among them concerning Dr. Freyer. He
speaks the Mandarin dialect. This is the
tongue of Northern and Central China. A
few pupils have studied that dialect, but
many more have engaged/under the fos
tering influence of the College of Com
merce of the University of California, in
the study of Cantonese. The whisper is
heard that jealousy of the growing inter
est in Cantonese has been at the bot
tom of the sudden change that the uni
versity has made. .
For nearly, two years the Rev. Dr. John
Gardner, who is widely known as a Chi
nese scholar, and who has been in daily
contact with Chinese from the Canton
province, in his dual capacity of Govern
ment interpreter and Chinese missionary,
has been giving gratuitous instruction to
all comers who -wished to study at the
Hopkins Institute of Art. and his pupils
say that they were pleased with the ad
vancement made by them., A few weeks
ago Walter Fong; was appointed to suc
ceed Dr. Gardner and was given a salary.
The 'first fruit of this Is a charge of $5
per term for instruction. The. next fruit
is.4he outspoken indignation of the former
students of Cantonese.

If was evident that either the Hillegass
tract could not be purchased or the pro
posed residence could not be erected at
present. Several regents objected strong
ly In any case to making appropriations
from an already depleted fund.
Mrs. Hearst came to the rescue and said
that she would meet the payments as thev
fell due to tho contractors if work could'
begin at once, and would wait to be re
imbursed until there should be money In
the permanent improvement fund. The
The situation that confronted the re
gents was this: The $23,000 appropriated
in February would seriously deplete the
permanent improvements fund, and for
that reason the building of the residence
has been delayed. The regents have been
negotiating for the purchase of the Hille
gass tract, to enlarge the university site.
When that deal is consummated there
will be little remaining in the fund for the
residence appropriation.
To make the situation more perplexing.
Regent Denicke announced that the low
est bidder had put' in a bid of. over $35,000.
It had been understood at the -beginning
that the complete cost of the residence
would be about twice the $25,000 of the ap
propriation. The contract s had . been
awarded to the lowest bidder, but before
the committee could proceed a further ap
propriation was necessary in order that
the contract price be covered by the ap
propriations. s:Â«- ,-
The University of California Is arain_a
Â«ebtor to the . generosity of Mrs. Phebe
Hearst. â¢ At an adjourned meeting of the
regents yesterday she volunteered to ad
vance money as payments should fall due
for the erection of the president's resi
dence, and in consequence work upon that
building will begin at once. . In addition
to this. President Wheeler Â¦ announced
that a "regent to whom the university
owed gratitude for many benefactions"
had decided to establish a lectureship in
the history of art. That was also Mrs.
Hearst. â¢Â»
The question of the president's residence
came up for discussion through the read
ing of a resolution offered by R?gent
Denicke that Jlu.OUO be provided in addi
tion to the $23,000 appropriated in Febru
ary* for the residence, to be paid as the
funds should become available. The re
gents went into executive session to dis
cuss that and other financial questions.

Police Sergeant "William Price has sued
out an alternative writ of mandate direct
ed to the Board of Police Commissioners
asking the Superior Court to set aside and
cancel the action of the old board In, dis
rating him and to compel that body to re
store him to his former rank of lieuten
ant, or show cause.
Just before the Commissioners adjourned
last night Chairman Newhall produced a
summons and a copy of the writ, which
he declared had been served on him as
president of the board during the day, and
told the other members of the board its
contents.
A motion was made to refer the matter
to the City Attorney, but Newhall ob
jected, saying that as that official had al
ready given an opinion he was prejudiced
In the matter. This brought the remark
from Commissioner Mahoney that he en
tertained . an opposite view from that ex
pressed In the City Attorney's decision In
asmuch as he never looked on Price as a
lieutenant
"Well, If your opinion is correct," Joined
In Judge Wallace. "I consider it the prop
er thing to inform that gentleman that
we want his decision on that particular
point, and we will contest the suit on that
ground."
Mahoney replied that the decision was
based on the assumption that the board
considered Price a lieutenant, whereas
the consolidation act, which was in force
when Price was promoted, made no pro
vision for such rank or office. The mat
ter was finally referred to the City Attor
ney with instructions to consider the le
gality of Price's original appointment as
lieutenant. The case has been assigned
to Judge Hebbard.
Billy Abbott, the notorious tenderloin
saloon-keeper, appeared before the board
and begged hard for further time in which
to dispose of bis business. He claimed
that his place was heavily incumbered
and that tie was bound by a long lease.
He promised that if given- until January
next he would settle his affairs and quit
his business.
The feeling of the commission was man
ifest, however, and Abbott's pleading had
no effect. While he was imploring the
motion for refusal was passed without
dissent.
Abbott's license expires on the 23d inst.
Officer William Isaacs was fined $15 for
reporting late for duty, and for the same

that he had refused to do so. The com
mission upheld the Chief.

SUES THE BOARD
TO RESTORE HIM
TO FORMER RANK
H. E. Knight, the first mate of the May
Flint, was the next witness. His testi
mony In connection with the course of
the vessel from the time she passed the
north head until she crashed upon the
ram of the Iowa was practically the same
as that given by Captain Woodside. The
In answer to various queries the witness
insisted that he had every reason to feel
that he could have come Into the bay in
safety. There was a good wind, clear
weather, light and apparently a clear
passage. The ship was behaving well and
there was danger in the lower bay. With
the aid of models the witness Illustrated
the blow from the Iowa which sent his
mammoth vessel to the bottom of the bay.
He was asked why he did not throw out
his anchors when he saw that he must
Ftrike the Iowa. He replied that he never
felt sure that he would strike the Iowa,
and so he went ahead.
In coming up the harbor Captain Wood
side declared that he took the fairway, a
most important fact. In the fairway, he
eaid, he had the best passage, and when
passing Washington-street wharf had a
good working breeze near tha wharves.
The vessel was making a five-knot speed
at the time. The captain insisted that the
wind held him until he' approached within
fifty yards of the warship Iowa. The ves
sel obeyed the helm well until the ship
lost the wind, and then trouble began.
The ship was continued on its course be
cause, the captain said, he expected at
any moment to secure a tug, and as long
as he had the wind he felt perfectly safe
In going down the bay.
He did not take the outside passage be
cause In the other he had almost ' a
straight course. He did not anchor In the
lower bay because he had a very long
ship and did not care to risk rounding her
to in the lower bay, because of the num
ber of vessels there.
6 o'clock, he said, and with a good breeze.
All sails, with a very few exceptions, were
set. He knew nothing of the parade, he
declared, nor of anything that was going
on In the harbor. There was a five-knot
breeze as the May Flint was within fifty
yards of the Iowa. The tide was setting
in toward the wharves and he was afraid
to let go his anchors. He scraped by the
warship, apparently doing no damage.
"When the May Flint had got clear of the
Iowa he noticed that his vessel was set
tling ahead. He saw a bark ahead and
discovered that It was the VIdette. He
let go an anchor, but collided with the
bark. It was light enough to see all that
happened. There were eleven vessels
from Melggs wharf to the spot where the
accident happened and Ire did not care to
anchor and be in their way. He'expected
the tide at any moment and exercised
his best judgment In the emergency.
Captain Woodside testified that he ex
pected and hoped to obtain the services
of a tug, but his evidence showed con
clusively that he made not even a rea
sonable effort to secure one. After he
and his Important officers had been heard
the Investigators closed the case and an
nounced that their decision will be ren
dered in a few days.
Captain Wcodside. the first witness, re
lated the Ftory of the wreck as he knows
It. The ship passed Point Bonita about
The' testimony of several witnesses was
taken before the case was submitted.
Several members of the crew of the May
Flint gave their evidence and told again
the story of how the sailing vessel
crashed down upon the terrible ram of
the Iowa. In the Investigation one im
portant fact admitted by every witness
was developed â the May Flint never would
have gone to destruction If her master
had anchored her In the lower bay or
employed the services of a tug to carry
him through the maze of ships which
were celebrating California's birthnight
as he entered the bay.
A year ago, however, authority was
given to Federal Inspectors to supervise
tailing ships as well as steam vessels,
and the wreck of the May Flint gave op
portunity for the first Investigation.
Authority to Institute the inquiry was
given to Captain Bolles and Captain
Bulger by John Bermlngham, Supervis
ing Inspector of the First District, and
Captain Woodside was summoned to ap
pear yesterday and defend himself.
The inquiry was Instituted to determine
wh'ether or not Captain Marshall A.
"Woodside, master of the May Flint, shall
be suspended from his rights under hi?
license or shall forfeit his certificate as a
master for culpability In the wreck of the
ship which crashed into the swordlike ram
of the Iowa. Federal Inspectors have
never attempted before to investigate the
conduct of masters of 6alllng vessels,
national Investigations being confined to
f-teamshlps.
AN official Investigation, unique In
the history of the United States,
was made yesterday by the local
I'nlted States Inspectors of Steam
and Sailing Vessels. It was the first in
quiry of the kind In the history of the
Federal marine service, and will act either
as the occasion for stubborn litigation or
as a precedent In a field which until yes
terday had never been traversed. It was
an official Investigation by Captain O. F.
Bolles and Captain J. K. Bulger, local
Inspectors of Steam and Sailing Vessel?,
of the wreck of the sailing vessel May
Flint on the night of the 8th inst.
crowd of ships In the lower bay the fair
wind, good behavior of the vessel and ap
parent free passage were all described as
the captain had pictured them. The ex
amination in this case, as In that of the
captain, was largely technical In Its char
acter ( and possessed no general Interest.
This witness also described, by the aid of
models, how the two ships crashed to
gether. It was significant that the descrip
tion was identical with that given by the
captain. One lnterestingg 'point developed
by Knight was that the wind failed the
May Flint almost In a flash.
Alex Parker, the second mate of the
May Flint, was the next witness. He was
suffering from an aggravated case of
stage fright and was nervously inaudible'
In much that he testified. His evidence,
however, was not particularly material, as
on the ship he had very little to do other
than feel the effects of what others had
done. He gave his Impressions, however,
of the actions of his superiors, and de
clared that In his opinion they had not
only taken the best course after entering
the harbor, but the only course. The sec
ond mate served more as a corroborative
witness than anything else.
John F. Hubert, who was lookout on the
May Flint on the night of her destruction,
was the next witness. His testimony pos
sessed simply the significance of showing
CAPTAIN MARSHALL A. WOODSIDE ILLUSTRATES, WITH THE AID
OF MODELS, BEFORE THE FEDERAL INSPECTORS, HOW THE
MAY FLINT CRASHED UPON THE GIANT RAM OF THE IOWA.
that the management of the vessel con
formed to all seafaring 1 rules. The cap
tain had neglected nothing that might be
a safeguard to his vessel. Every condi
tion in the bay had been reported by the
lookout, and nothing that mlpht be an
injury was overlooked. The May Flint
was at least a quarter of a mile away
when the lookout sighted, described and
announced the Iowa. The lookout differed
from the other witnesses, however. In one
Important pacticular piece of evidence.
He swore that the May Flint let go her
anchor before she struck the Iowa, while
the captain and other witnesses were
equally positive that the anchor was let
go after the collision.
James Bulllmcre, who was at the wheel
of the May Flint on the night of the acci
dent, testified that the ship behaved splen
didly durinj? tho entire voyage until she
struck the Iowa. Further than this his
testimony was not Important and he was
excused. Captain Woodslde then explained
that he had hoped to secure a tug. had
prepared for one and was on the lookout
for one, but he did not further try to se
cure one. Agents of the Merchants" Ex
change came alongside, but he told them
nothing of his desires, and went on until
his ship was spitted by the giant ram of
the Iowa. With this the case closed and
the matter was taken under advisement.
Visits Were Made to Grammar Grades
