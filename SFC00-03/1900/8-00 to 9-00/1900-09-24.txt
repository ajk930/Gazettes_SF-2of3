mons were invariably on the subject of

told his congregation that; the mine
workers could not win. He advised them
to refrain from acts of -violence and to
return to work. He pointed' out that the

the opinion is generally expressed that to

SCBANTON, Pa., Sept 28.â It now begins to look as if the strike would extend to the railroaders, at
least in this region. The switchmen had another conference to-day with their national officers, Grand Master
Frank T. Hawley and Grand Secretary John E. Tipton,-of Buffalo, to discuss the request of the striking miners
that they refuse to handle non-union coal. Nothing could be learned of what was done, further than that the
national officers and a committee of the local switchmen would go to New York to-morrow and that on their
return something definite would be done. The purpose of their visit is supposed to -be to petition President
Truesdale of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western to spare them the task of handling the non-union wash
ery calum and save them from the alternative of striking or refusing the miners' request.

under control a block and a half of frame
buildings had been destroyed, including;
three livery stables and several horses.
The fire had gained considerable headway
when discovered and as the wind *-n

company was practically powerless. From
the barn the fire Jumped the alley and
caught the fine new livery stable ot

And thus Japan prevented the consum

In taking this step the object kept In view
has been to suppress the insurgents and to
rescue the diplomatic representatives and other
foreigners. Beyond that the powers have no
ulterior motives. Our Government, as Is known
to your Majesty, entertains feelings of cordial
friendship for your Majesty's country, so should
circumstances make it nwessary Japan will not
decline to use her good offices on behalf of
China-
If your Majesty's Government will earnestly
suppress the Insurgents and rescue the foreign
representatives, their suites and other foreign
ers, the situation will be simplified and the
solution of the crisis will be found relatively
easy. The suppression of the insurgents and
the rescue of the foreign representatives are
duties which your Majesty owe no less to your
country than to the other nations of the world
end must be accomplished without the least de
lay or hesitation. Since last month the power*
have fiiepatched large forces to TientBin, and
Japan has likewise found it necessary to Â«end
troops.
As a reply to the demand of Germany that the leaders in the
Boxer movement be delivered up for punishment, the Imperial Gov
ernment of China has promoted Prince Tuan to a responsible position
and removed the fricndlx Taotai of Shanghai from office.
American troops as speedily as would be

general election campaign to bestow much
attention upon the Chinose problem. The

replies of the United Stales Government,
Bays:
The polJcr thus laid down implies the exlst

timate cf the good will of the Chinese rulers. It
it to be feared that the action of the United
Ptatea will tend to weaken the moral Influence
oK the allies and for this reason It is to be
i^*atly regretted.
Ac-cording to the Peking correspondent
of the Daily News, wiring on September
16, the Chinese declare most positively
that the Empress Dowager and the Em
p<Â»ror will In no case return to the impe
rial palace In Peking, as they hold that
it has been desecrated by the Intrusion of
TiarViarians. This Irreconcilable attitude
receives confirmation In many reports
r-manating from Shanghai. One of these
5s that, as a reply to the denunciation of
Prir.ce Tuan and others by the Viceroys,
an imperial edict, r'ated September 17,
deals more leniently with the Boxer move
ment and reminds the people that both
the Boxers and Chinee Christians are
Chinamen, who shall receive imperial pro
tection if they quietly disperse to their
homes. The edict points out that it is im
possible for the Imperial Government to
distinguish between good and bad Boxers.
It EayB, however. If the Boxers continue
to assemble they . will be dealt with sum
marily.
Another report says that the edict
frankly declares that no executions can be
functioned until an adequate inquiry has

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, Sept. 23.â Under the im
petus of a strong wind, which blew during
all of to-day, the forest fire which has bÂ«en
raging for two days past in the vicinity of
Occidental Epread with terrible rapadity
to-day, doing incalculable damage.
The North Pacific Coast Railroad was
probably the heaviest loser, for in addi
tion to the destruction of several miles of
track, the trestle. 219 feet In length, north
of Occidental, was destroyed by the
flames. The fire spread quickly along the
track and only by the hardest kind of
work was the - next trestle, 300 feet in
length, saved.
Notwithstanding the company has a
large force of men fighting the fire. It Is
feared that the latter trestle may ulti
mately be burned, so fierce is the sweep of
the blaze. Should the wind, which at
nightfall somewhat abated, spring up
again, the trestle is almost sure to go.
In addition to the burning of the rail
way trestle, two county bridges along the
county road were destroyed and also

oped in stifling smoke and threat- j
ened with destruction. Occidental j
has been fighting desperately j
since Friday afternoon, to pre- j
serve itself from on-rushing flanks. Every ;
able-bodied man. except those who have ,
been exhausted by the Intense heat or by j
ceaseless vigil, is out fighting the con
flagration.* The fire has already swept
over a tract at least ten miles long of
wooded hills, destroying everything in its
pathway, and is still fiercely raging. Its
course at present has been turned by a
change in the wind, and the town is not
now in any danger, but how long this i
security will last none can foretell.
The conflagration started on the land of
an Italian farmer named James Frances
chl, who was burning brush. In some un- i
known manner the brush fire got beyond j
his control, and almost Instantly the
trees, chapparral and dense brush on all
sides were in flames. The point at which
the conflagration cririnated is one mile
west of Ocidental. In passing through a
canyon the blaze divided into three
branches, one going toward Bodega, one
toward the ccast and a third toward Oc
cidental. The one which made its de
structive march toward the coast has
been subdued, but the remaining two are
still advancing-^
Occidental's greatest peril came on Fri
day night. The hills which surround the
town were completely^ burned over. The
fire advanced to the very edge of the
town. Back fires were started within the
town itself, just in the rear of the Native
Sons' Hall. The air was filled with huge
billows of smoke mingled with thousands
of burning firebrands, some of which
were blown miles from the fire.
The exact loss can never be computed.
The North Pacific Railroad will lose thou
sands of dollars In burned trestles alone.
One trestle which was totally destroyed
was valued at 53000. It was eighty-seven
feet In height and ppanned a wide can
yon. The loss in timber and tan bark will
never be known. The county bridges and
all fencing that stood In the course of the
fire have been completely wiped out of
existence. The homes of many lumber
men and dairymen have beea completely
desolated. W. Pattlson, M. Bigelow, A.
Craln and Martin Farrell, an old-time res
ident and pioneer, have lost their homes
and all their possessions. Jasper O'Far
rell, for whom O'Farrell street In San
Francisco is named, lost his barns, fenc
ing and all the equipment of his dairy.
The water system of the town, which was
situated on the side of a neighboring hill,
has been destroyed and the people are
threatened with a water famine.
Occidental Is by no means the only town
that Is suffering from this scourge of Ore.
An appeal for men to go to Bodega to
fight the fire, which is making rapid pro
gress in. that direction, has Just been re
ceived. None can be spared, as all but
the exhausted are impressed into service.
The report states that unless help is sent
Immediately the dairies around Bodega
are doomed to destruction. Valley Ford
is situated directly in the course which
the fire Is now taking.
At 4 o'clock this afternoon the town of
Freestone was surrounded by fire. Tho
wall of flames approached to within tifty
yards of the town before the fire fighters
succeeded in turning It back. The big
trestle on the North Pacific. 137 feet high,
had a narrow escape from destruction. It
was threatened by conflagration from
four directions, and the back fires started
in the attempt to check the advancing
flames got away from the control of the
men. The conflagration Is now working
toward Sebastopol, and the town Is in
danger.
As accurate an estimate as can possibly
be made places the total losses of timber,
farm houses, dairies, ranch properties and
railway trestles at $1.0*,000. The area of
land burned over Is 100 square miles.-
flames.
Immense damage has been done by the forest fires of the past
three days in Sonoma and Mann coinities. Estimates place the loss
in timber and ranch and railroad property in Sonoma County alone
at $1,000,000. One hundred square miles of territory zvas sii'ept by
the schoolhouse at Geneva. The fire
swept over an area nine miles in length
and to-night many farmers are homeies.*
and their property destroyed. Just how
many farm places were burned has not
yet been ascertained. Fortunately no
lives were lost, though thrilling races for
life were many.
During to-day the railway company con
tinued its trains in operation, notwith
standing the destruction of the trestle
work. Passengers and baggage were
transferred across the ravine and con
tinued on their journey by another train
on the other side.
A large force of men have been put to
work to rebuild the burned trestle and
track.

DEPUTIES ACCUSED OF CRIBCE.
Robbery attf" reeland.
Three Officers Arrested for Highway
TIAZEL.TOX. Pa.. Sept. 23.â Three of the
deputies who were sworn in by Sheriff
Harvey of Luzcrne County and who are
sons of prominent Wilkesbarre families,
Â¦were arreeted late, last night at Freeland
on the charge of highway robbery. They
are Hamilton Farnham. Van Buren B.
Howard and A. It. Shoemaker Jr. The men
are accused of robbing a Polish liquor
dealer of J1C7 }n caph. There are two
fides to the story. The Polander *ays he
was delivering beer at Highland and that
the deputies asked him and he consented
xo let them ride in hie wagon to Freeland.
At the outskirts of that place, he claims,
the men assaulted h!m and took the
money from his pocket.
The other story is to the effect that the
Polander demanded a feo for bringing the
deputies to Freeland, and hot getting It he
set up a cry that he nad been robbed. A
crowd noon gathered and the deputies
Â¦were taken into custody and piven a hear
ing before a Justice of the Peace, which
lasted until 2 o'clock this morning. The
pquire committed the three men, but ln
rtead of locking them up at Freeland tho
accused were driven thirty miles over tht
mountain to Wnkesbarre. where they ar
rived at daylight this morning. This was
done in order to prevent the possibility of
the men being taken from the local lock
â¢vp by a crowd which was etUI waiting to
see what disposition was to be made of
the deputies. There Is an exceedingly
etrong feeling against deputies in this
region, be they charged with crime or

SALISBURY'S MANIFESTO
TO BRITISH ELECTORS
Emphasizes the Necessity of Sup-
porting the Queen's Government
by a Strong Majority.
LONDON, Sept. 23.â Lord Salisbury'*
manifesto to the voters of the United
Kingdom, in anticipation of the Parlia
mentary general elections, emphasized the 1
necessity that the Queen's Government
should be supported by a strong Parlia
mentary majority as "the only means
of convincing the inhabitants of the con
quered South African territories that
there Is no hope of diverting the Govern
ment from its policy by persistent resist
ance or asitation."
After remarking that "all the recent
troubles In South Africa have been due
to a shift of Parliamentary opinion at a
critical moment," the Pfime Minister goes
on to say:
It will depend upon the disposition and con
duct of the Uoers how Ions an Interval is to
flaj.se before their full position as a British
colony is attained. The brilliant success of
I^orii Roberts' army must not blind us to the
imperfections disclosed in our own . defensive
armor, imperfections which, but for the war.
miÂ£bt have remained unnoticed. It will bt^
the urgent duty of Parliament and the Govern
ment to remo\e these defects, a duty which
certainly could not be discharged by a Minis
try dependent upon a broken party.
In conclusion, Lord Salisbury refers to
China as "a difficulty, among others, con
fronting the Government and requiring
that the Government should be armed
with a stronc majority in the House of
Commons." He urges that, in view of
all these considerations, there should be
no abstentions from the polls.
Mr. John Morley, Liberal member for
Montrose Burghs. In his manifesto, de
clares that his opinion has not changed
that everything might have been attained
in South Africa without war. "In a single
year." he says, "the work of a generation
in uniting the Dutch and English In South
Africa has been undone, and not even in
Ireland has the difficult race problem
been more miserably mishandled."
Mr. Morley admits, however, that it is
Impossible to remove the proclamations
of annexation.
COAT OF VABNISH FOB
TWO ZIONIST ELD/ERS
Boughly Handled by a Mob at Mans-
field, Ohio, and Ordered Out
of the Town.
MANSFIELD, Ohio, Sept. 23.-Another
mob firoke loose here this afternoon, and
Ciders Kphraim Bassinger of Biuffton and
Silas Moot, of Lima wore its victims. The
two elders got oft an Erie train early
this morning unknown to tho authorities.
They were recognized by a small crdwd at
the depot, which refused to let them enter
a cab, then fpllowed up the street and
surrounded them near the center of the
city. They were taken by the mob to
the Rochland Buggy Works, where Bas
slnger was made to disrobe. The crowd
tore Moot's clothing from his body, as
he refused to disrobe himself.
A paint bucket and a brush were ob
tained, and smokestack varnish, a tar
like substance, was - daubed over them
from head to foot. It was matted in their
hair, and no partof their bodies escaped
but their faces. Their bodies were then
partially CQvered with their clothing, and
the elders were marched to the home of
E. H. Leiby, a Zion follower here, who
was driven out of th< city last Sunday.
There they promised not to return to
Mansfield, but later they said that they
agreed not to return unless Overseer Pi
per ordered them to come.
TBEMENDOTJS BLAST

PUEBLO, Colo., Sept. 23.â A special to
the Chleftan from Texaa Creek, Colo.,
where Orman and* Crook are making the
grade for the Rio Grande branch to Silver
Cliff, Bays:
"At 4:56 p. m. one of the largest shots
ever used in railway construction was
fired in the Texas Creek Canyon There
were 610 kegs of blasting powder used be
sides a quantity. of giant powder, which
altogether dislodged nearly 20.000 cubic
yards of rock. The blast was pronounced
a thorough success. AH trains on the
main line were stopped by signal several
miles each side of the canyon and all the
livestock in the camp was removed to a
safe distance. Contrary to expectations
the report was not heavy, although the
shock was plainly felt on surrounding
mountain sides. Quite a party from Pu
eblo and other points had arrived to view
the spectacle, which was magnificent No
injuries resulted, though a shower of
small stones which followed the explosion
covered a radius of half a mile.

CLEVELAND, Chic. Sept. 23.â Senator
Hanna, chairman of the Republican Na
tional Committee, dlpcussed campaign is
sues at considerable length in. im inter-
View with The Call correspondent to-day.
He did not rnince words in expressing his
scorn for V.'illiam J. Bryan. He said the
so-called Imperialism and so-called trust
issnei would "fall flat" and the real issue
of the campaign was whether the country
should continue under the gold standard
or have the free coinage of silver at the
ratio of 16 to 1. Said lie:
0 FJrran Is making an ass of himself. He is
wabbllos arouml from ono issue to another,
tryir.s to find rafe ground on which to stand
No sooner docs ho tall; on one of hls< so-called
issues than the jS-op is knocked from under
him and he makes a flying Jump over to some
other ro-calltd lsFue.
It will not be manjr days before he must say
Â«fimethini about thi real issuo of the cam
âal-n He niuBt come out and stand, on thÂ«
rraT lss^e. Bryan i3 promising anything ami
trrerjlhltS with the understanding that his
Crfmlsea will be fulfilled in the event of his
election. He is a man who is burning up with
the desire to hold office. He i3 nothing more
nor less than an eager office seeker, and he
will promise anything and wiy anything if he
thinks it will help his chances of election.
Democratic politicians all over the country
are iiromisinz party workers all kinds of po
eitioas. I know personally of cases where peo-
Dle who had been promised Jobs under Bryan
have asked the ones who made the promises
what authority they hart to make thÂ«m and
how they were to know if the. promises would
be Â»=et>t If Bryan wnre elected, and they have
been told that authority had come from Bryan
himself, in black ar.d ivhite.
I do not Hnow how many polltlcjil positions
Bryan has promised, but I Â£uess he will hav:
to ujmLu several new nlac>s if he exoects to
make good his promises. I do know that Bryan
lias rromlsed Crokcr one of the Cabinet po?l
tiona and probably more than on<Â». By prom
isirf them to broker I mean that* Bryan has
j-.reed to allow Croker. to name the men for
certain Cabinet positions.
The m>ort that there is wholesale defection
among the German Republicans on account of
the .clar.trap issue of imperialism and militar
ism hae about as much truth as the nveroce
rcziort that appears in the Democratic pacers
in this campaigm. There are German Demo
crats, of course, but the Germans generally
are Reoubllcanf, and I do not believe that
they are being: led away from the real issue â
the money ouestion â by Bryan's claptrap the
ory.
In regard to Bryan and Croker's claim that
there Is no opportunity for the young men of
the country, that Is too utterly ridiculous to
discuss seriously. Bryan Is not very old, yet
ing be 1b an office seeker and haa no visible
means of support. He seems to be able to get
enough to live on pretty comfortably. I don't
know whether I will make any more speeches
or not.
REPUBLICANS TOO APATHETIC.
Hanna Goes East to Arouse Party
Leaders Into Action.
Special Dlsratch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 23.â Senator M. A^
Hanna, chairman of the Republican Na
tional Committee, will be back at East
ern headquarters, 1 Madison avenue, to
morrow, and he is coming for t-wo pur
poses: First, to ascertain if New York
Is a doubtful State, and therefore a piv
otal State in this campaign; second, to
lind out whether the business and finan
cial interests of the East are still. deaf to
his requests for funds with which to con
duct the campaign.
Republican leaders generally admit that
a critical stage in the campaign is ap
i preaching 1 . Democratic leaders are watch
1 1Â»Â»k to take advantage of their apathy.
The Republicans have already confessed
that they stand in great danger of losing
control of the next House of Representa
tives. The Democrats declare with con-
Jldonce that they are going to win the
next House. The difference between the
Â«'or.gre:.pional manngers of the two par
tics la that the Republicans know just
v/bore thev are going to lose and are fa-
I nil:.Ti- with' all the weak spots, whereas
: the Democrats can give no Information a3
d!?tricts seem to be going haphazard. Â¦
Senator Hanna and his associatea have
been at great trouble to arouse the busi
iifss interests of the country.
The Republican managers have display- i
ed a table which gives McKinley 251
votes. This total is twenty less votes ,
than he had in 12TG. The States the Re
publican managers claim are:
Iowa 13,Oregon 4

as great as between the Sunday after the
storm and the preceding Sunday. Many
people attended church services and the
day passed without disorder or excite

A committee of the City Council ap
peared before the central committee to
day to confer with reference to obtain
ing funds to maintain the police, fire,
water and other necetsary departments
of the city government. The central com
mittee requests Governor Sayers to come

The payrolls for the laborers who
worked en the streets under the military
regime from September IS to September
21 were completed Saturday night. Dis
tribution of pay checks commenced to
day and about" $3000 was paid out. This
covers about TO per cent of the payrolls at
$1 50 per day for the men employed in
clearing the streets of debris and dead
bodies. In all about forty bodies were
taken from the ruins to-day. To-morrow
it is estimated that 2500 men will be at
work on the wreckage. Thirty days will
be required to do the work.
The plan to erect homes for those who
lost everything by the storm, so earnestly
advocated by Clara Barton, is meeting
with every encouragement. A large fund
is to be raised for this purpose to be dis
bursed by Miss Barton.
Five hundred and seventy-six persons

MARSHAL DE
CAMPOS IS DEAD
Governor of Madrid and
Predecessor of Weyler
Passes Away.
MADRID. Sept. 23.â Marshal Martinez
de Campos died this morning shortly after
10 o'clock at Zarause, near San Sebastian.
Marshal Martinez" Campos, the Spanish
general and statesman, was born in 1834,
went through the campaign of Morocco
in 1859 as a member of the staff of the
commander in chief, O'Donnell, and was
promoted to the rank of major. In 1SU1
he joined the army of Cuba as colonel,
and remained six years on that iÂ§land.
After the' abdication of King Amadeo he
declined to give his adhesion to the
new order of things and made no secret
of his antipathy to the republic. He was
put on the retired list in 1873, and shortly
afterward was confined in a fortress as
a conspirator. Â»
From his prison he Addressed to the
Minister of War the well known letter in
which lie requested permission to go and
fight, as a private, under the orders of
General Concha, the Carlist forces in
Navarre and the Basque provinces. â¢ This
letter obtained for him nls liberty, and he
was sent to the Army of the North in
April, 1S74, to command a division cf the
Third Corps.
General Campos met wlt*h such signal
success in his military operations that tha
high dignity of captain general of the
army, which Is equivalent to that of a
marshal of France, was the recompense
for his services. *
In 18SS he was appointed captain general
of New Castile. This post he left in order
to proceed to Cuba, where the refusal to
grant reform had rekindled the Insurrec
tion. He arrived In Havana April 26, 1S95.
and successfully met the rebels in several
engagements. In September he forwarded
a petition for home rule, and throughout
he was in favor of meeting the rebels half
way. This petition, however, did not meet
with favor at home and he was recalled
In January, 1S96, to be succeeded by Gen
eral Weyler. Since then he had been Gov
ernor of Madrid and during the threatened
dynastic troubles he had been Chle^ Coun
selor of the Queen Regent.

PRETORIA, Sept. "23. â A proclamation

Bloemfontein or Pretoria, was Issued to
day. In case of having stock selected rep

MONTREAL, Sept. 23.â Lieutenant Hob
son arrived in this rity t. s evening. He
was shown the answer made by Admiral
Dewey to the interview with the lieuten
ant sent out from Vancouver. He said
he was deeply grieved that Admiral
Dewey had taken the matter up in the
way reported. He declared that he was
not responsible for the statement made
in the Vancouver interview. He had been
approached by a reporter and in the
course of a conversation had stated that
the Spanish ships had been sunk because
the plugs were drawn bv the Spaniards.
He explained that it was impossible to
sink a ship by hitting it above the water
line. Admiral Dewey had. however, com
pelled the Spaniard* to sink their ships,
and that was just as effective as sinking
them with shells. Personally he had the
highest posssible respect for Admiral
Dewey and his groat achievement, and he
greatly regretted that anything had been
attributed to him which might tend to de
stroy the glory of the admiral's deeds.

There Is not the shadow of a plotâ but

acter sketching (except, perhaps, Kelly

to dt-mand; the farce is eminently vul

advertised "fast and furious fun" is
chiefly conspicuous by its absence.

wife died seme time ago and since then
he has frequently been seen with a woman
named May Arlington. It is s;iid that the
Arlington woman's attachment for Doug
las was' inspired by no other circumstance
than for the purpose of securing from him
as much of his money as she could obtain.
Yesterday afternoon, some hours after the
death of Mrs. Gotthold, the Arlington
woman was arrested for vagrancy upon
the demand of Policeman James Oouglas,
a brother of the Trustee.
Chief of Police Sullivan emphatically de
nies that the arrest of the Arlington
woman was in any way connected with
the death of Trustee Douglas' daughter,
but that she was arrested for vagrancy
and for no other cause. The chemist em

Conductor Davidson was later arrested
at the power-house by Policeman Me-
Quade and charged at the City Prison
with assault to commit murder. Notwith
standing the seriousness of the charge
Bond Clerk Greeley accepted $100 cash bail
and Davidson was released. He had
throv.-n away the knife Tvith which he did
the cutting before his arrest and it was
not recovered. He claims he acted in self
defense.
"Seeing that my brother was all but out.
as I thought. I grabbed Duffey and found
that he had been cut in the cheek. After
crying that he had been atabbed he left
the car."
The motorman would not admit that he
saw his brother use a knife on Duffey.
"McI-auKhlin and Duffev after boarding
the car insisted on crowding two women
out of their scats. After I had remon
strated with them they started to sing ri
bald songs. One of the women appealed
to me. and after stopping the car I start
ed to eject the two men. McLaughlin Im
mediately jumped from his seat and
struck me on the eye. I summoned my
brother, who was on the back platform,
and together we proceeded to throw the
obnoxious passengers off the car. Jusv.
then Duffey struck my brother a terrific
blow in the face, almost knocking him off
the dummy. McLaughlln was fighting
viciously, but after receiving a few blows
he got cold feet and ran away.
Captain Spillane, upon learning of the
affair, sent a policeman to arrest the con
ductor. He found the motorman, who is
a brother of the conductor, and took him
to police headquarters. When questioned
Davidson refused to say whether or not
his brother had cut Duffey. His version
of what had happened before the cutting
was as follows:
According to Duffey's story he and
his brother-ln-la-cv, Charles McLaughlln,
boarded the car at Twenty-third street.
After riding several blocks they engaged
in si dispute with the conductor, who
started to eject them. Getting the worst
of the encounter, Davidson drew a knife
and proceeded to carve Duffey. The latter
finally jumped from the car and went to
the Receiving Hospital, where his wounds
were dressed.
During a row on a Kolsom-street car
last night John Duffey. a horseshoer.^was
slashed across the cheek, arm and head
by Frank Davidson, the conductor. The
wound in thÂ« cheek extended from the
corner of the mouth to the back of the
neck. It required twenty-three stitches to
sew it up.

Myron Brown, an Oakland teamster.
was shot and severely wounded last night
in Alameda by Policeman George N. Mc-
Rae while trying to esc:*a in a buggy
with two companions after they had all
been arrested for fast driving and disturb
ance. Charles Kelly, a teamster, had his
right arm grazed by a bullet, and another %
ball from the policeman's bullet wounded
the horse. The third man, Mai Jacobs.
also a teamster, was not hit.
The shooting occurred at 7 o'clock on
Santa Clara avenue, near St. Charles
street. The trio had been racing down tha
avenue, headed west. McKae heard the
rig go by as he was on his way to his beat
from Walnut street. In the distance hÂ«
saw the busgy tearing at top speed of a
lively horse. Jumping on an electric car
he started after the reckless drivers and
soon overhauled them.
There was a row when the policeman
tried to stop the party, but he finally got
them out of the buggy, handcuffed tha
driver. Brown, and then ordered the trio
into the vehicle under arrest. Brown,
manacted as he was, got the reins In his
hands and started off.
The policeman hung on to the buggy ana
was dragged a hundred feet. He drew h!a
pistol and fired two shots before he let go
and another as he lay in the street. â¢
The men got away, but were caught
by McRae later at the Alameda approach
to the Webster-street bridge. They sub
mitted to arrest, saying they were wound
ed. They were sent to the Oakland Re
ceiving Hospital. Dr. E. N. Ewer found
that Brown was shot In the back, the
bullet lodging out of reach of a probe and
probably under the right shoulder blade.
The wound is painful, but not considered
fatal. _
Kelly and Jacobs were- taken to the City
Jail, tv here they were charged with cru
elty to animals and resisting a police offi
cer. Brown admitted that he had been
racing his horse, but Jacobs and Kelly
denied that 'here was any disturbance or
trouble. Brown is 2S years old, married
and resides at 17."> Sixth street, Oakland.
He is employed by Jones' Express. Ja

â¢'Â¦When I grabbed the horse's head atter
overtaking the team I said: 'Enys. you
are under arrest." They replied with a
lot of oath?. Then I ordered Ke!Iy out
of the rig ard Brown tried to whip up the
horse. I grabbed him and handcuffed him.
I ordered the men back in the rig and
soid I would drive them up to the Jail.
"Brown got the lines and started the
horse and Kelly shoved me off the r'.tr.
As they whipped up I yelled "Stop or I'll
shoot.' Kelly hit me again and while I
was hanging on the side of the buggy I
pulled the pistol and fired."

Finally Bryan has lost his reputation for sincerity
in anything. He is known to have advocated the
treaty of Paris, which he now denounces. He is
known to have evaded a direct question concerning
what financial policy he would pursue if elected to
the Presidency. He is known to be the ally of Boss
Croker of Tammany Hall and the ice trust, while at
the same time denouncing trusts. It is known that
while he denounces imperialism he is at the same time
courting the favor of men like Morgan of Alabama
and ether Southern politicians who are the only
out and out imperialists of the country.
In short, the answer to B*ryan's question is to be
found in the fact that since 1896 all the conditions of
the country have changed, that the opinions of many
former free "coinage men have changed with them
that we have prosperity where we once had"adver
sity, and that Bryan himself no longer appears to the
public in same guise. There are plenty of reasons,
therefore; why men who supported him then shouH
vote against him now, but very few why any one at
There were men who voted for Bryan in 1896 be
cause they believed him to be a patriot. Now they
perceive him to be a mere demagogue, resorting to
everV trick and device his cunning can conceive to
catch votes. They see him unscrupulous in his efforts
to array one class of citizens against another and to
discredit the foreign policy of the republic and weaken
Some men voted for Bryan in 1896 because they
sincerely believed it would be impossible to restore
prosperity to the industries of the country on the gold
basis. The experience of^the past four years has dis
sipated that belief. The gold standard has been firmly
established and the country has reached its highest
degree of prosperity. Though Bryan be not capable
of learning from experience,, other men are, and such
men are not going. to ignore the lesson they have
learned. They know that, during the McKinley ad
ministration the country has flourished, and they pro
pose this time to vote for the party of prosperity and
not the party of calamity.
That the question can be answered in many ways
is attested by the number of men who after support
ing Bryan in 1S96 are now against him. Each of these
men has his oÂ«vn reasons for the change, and the pub
lic is not ignorant of what they are.
DtjRINQ his campaign tour in Kansas and Mis
souri Bryan is reported to have asked in al
most every speech this question: "Why
should any man who voted with us in 1896 vote
against us now?"
BRYAN'S QUESTION.
It will be seen that the list is a good one. Had
Caffery and Howe stayed in they would not have
complicated the game, but since they have withdrawn
they will not be missed. Enough are left.
While there may be some sentimental regret that
the Southern candidate backed out, there will be no
testing sorrow. Even without Caffery there are can
didates enough. In addition to the ticket of Mc-
Kinley and Roosevelt, supported by Republicans,
and that of Bryan and Stevenson, supported by Dem
ocrats, Silver Republicans and Fusion Populists,
there are the following:
Mid-Road Populistâ Wharton Barker of Pennsylvania,
Ignatius Donnelly of Minnesota.
Prohibitionâ John J. Woolley of Illinois, Henry B.
Metcalf of Rhode Island.
Social Democratsâ Eugene V. Debs of Indiana, Job
Harriman of California.^
Social Laborâ Joseph F. Malloney of Massachusetts,
Valentine Remmell of Pennsylvania.
United Christianâ J. F. R. I^eonard of Iowa, Charles
M. Sheldon of Kansas.
National 'Union Reform-Seth Ellis' of Ohio, Samuel
T. Nicholson of Pennsylvania.
From one point of view the withdrawal of the
ticket is a loss to the campaign. Caffery was the only
candidate for the Presidency which the South has had
since i860. The distinguished gentleman from Loui
siana would not have been elected, but then there are
several other candidates whose chances are no better,
and, since all other sections have representatives in
the free-for-all strugle for the prize, it is desirable the
South should have had one also.
DISPATCHES from New York yesterday an
nounced that at a conference held in that city
the leaders of lhe "National" party had decided
tc withdraw their ticket, Caffery and Howe, from the
field and take no further part in the fight of the
year. The decision appears to have been forced
partly by the fact that the candidates withdrew and
partly by a lack of money to organize in any State
except New York. With no candidates and no
coin, the contest of the Nationalists would necessarily
have been a forlorn one, and it was an act of wisdom
to quit.
ENOUGH ARE LEFT.
In 1896 Bourke Cockran said: "The American peo
ple will never consent to substitute the republic of
Washington, of Jefferson, of Jackson for the republic
of an Altgeld. a Tillman or a Bryan." This year
Cockran is talking another way, but his prophecy
holds good.
THE debutantes! That is what we
are all interested in. now that
the season is about to burst and
bloom. Oh. the fewness of them:
But oh again, the quality! Only
four; the creme de la creme: the

has ever brought forth. It makes me
tingle with anticipated delight when I
think of their respective coming-out par
ties.
Marie Louise Parrott.
Marie Christine de Guigne.
Florence Breckenridge.
Lucie King.
Isn't that a quartet that would set any
younpr man a-thinking?
Just at present there is a little draw
back to Florence Breckenridge's debut.
Her uncle, Joshua TtTvis, is not enjoying
good health, and there is a possibility that
on his account Florence may not come
out. Ah! but I hope she will; we all de
voutly hope she will. She is so fetching,
bewitching and, mercy me, so witty! And
then the Tevisesâ well, they know how to
entertain, and they don't stop with a
knowledge of a thing.
And I don't know that the Parrotts are
so backward, either, when they start to
do things. And with the two Mariosâ De
Guigne and Parrottâ things are sure to
be kept humming in the Parrott family.
The prophets are already busy, and
they are saying Lucie King is to be the
beauty of the season. And I should not
wonder but that they 1 are right. She is a
willowy blonde, and looks likeâ an angel.
It is always the debutantes that make
a season. I'm preparing for loads of fun
this winter.

These points about cover the commercial situation
here and in the East. It will be seen that there is not

until after the election.
Locally there is little new in the commercial situa
tion. Downtown merchants, especially those engaged
in the export business, report a good movement in
merchandise. Farm and orchard products are mov

inrte nre maintained without difficulty. In fact, the
canners have withdrawn quotations for many descrip
tions of canned fruits, owing to depletion of stocks.
Grape-jrrowers are rejoicing in large prices for grapes.
The hop-growers are holding their crops for better
prices and have already forced the market up several
cents from the bids of a few weeks ago. Prices for
sheep and hogs have receded slightly, owing to in
creased receipts, but beef has not changed for some
little lime.

/ \ more signs of slackening up. The great anthra
â¢ *Â¦ cite coal strike, too, adds its quieting inlluence.
Uut on this coast we feel no effects of the strike, but
along the Atlantic seaboard, where the coal mines and
railroads are practically one, and both are largely
represented in Wall street, the strike is beginning to
affect some lines of trade, with a possibility of affect
ing others if it be prolonged. To the election and the
strike is ascribed the further decrease in bank clear
ing? last week, the percentage of loss, as compared
ivith the corresponding week last year, being 27.7 per
cem. The largest four cities showed a loss, that of
New York beine 38.6 and that of Boston 30.4 per cent.
As soon as the dead are buried, the streets cleared,
the homeless provided with shelter, the work of re
building Galveston will begin with all, the vim that
characterizes the people..' In a few years
the memory of the storm will fade away, but the im
petus it has given toward solidity of construction will
remain with the people, and in the end Galveston will
derive from the storm a profit that will be of benefit
to all future generations of her citizens.
It is inevitable that it should be so. Galveston wa;
not built into a great seaport by reason of caprice,
but because it possessed natural advantages over any
other harbor along that part of the G^ilf. The very
causes that induced railways and steamship lines to
center there in the first place will induce them to re
turn. Such a storm as that which has destroyed the
city is not likely to occur again, but ii it should it
will find a city better prepared to withstand its fury.
The officials of other railroads and of steamship
companies fiave made similar statements. All will re
place their warehouses, wharves and other property
by structures far stronger and more ample than those
that were destroyed.
Chief Engineer Hood of the Southern Pacific
Company is reported to have said when questioned on
the -subject: "The officers of the company in New
York were not slow in determining the company's
future policy in respect to Galveston. In the face of
the big disaster, which accomplished so much damage
to. railroad properties, they have decided that Gal
veston shall be all that President C. P. Huntington
intended it should be as a terminal point for
the handling of Atlantic seaboard freight, and
the extensive improvements that had been projected
and were under way when the awful disaster came
along nili be carried out according to the original
plans es fast as our crippled facilities will permit. The
construction of the demolished piers will be started
and pushed forward to completion as rapidly as pos
sible."
WHETHER Galveston is to be rebuilt or not is
a question that has been already settled. In
deed after the first day of speculation upon the
horror of the ruin wrought by the storm it has
hardly been a matter of doubt. It will be rebuilt, and
in the process of rebuilding will be improved to an ex
tent that would not have been attained for years had
not the hurricane cleared the ground and made way
for it.
THE FUTURE OF GALVESTON.
The issues of the campaign are important. Not
since the Civil War have there been political questions
of greater moment submitted to the suffrages of the
American people. No citizen should willingly sur
render his right to vote at an election whose result
will so materially affect private welfare and national
prosperity. ,
Bear in mind that all registrations prior to January
1, .1900, have been canceled. No man can vote who
has not registered this year. Registration closes
Wednesday. Your last chance is at hand. Profit by
it now or you lose it, and along with it one of the
highest privileges of your American citizenship.
There will be a rush during the closing days, but
it is better to join the rush than to lose a freeman's
right to vote. Moreover by going to the registration
office early it may be possible to avoid the long wait
that will be required of those who delay.
LAST CHANCE FOR REGISTRATION
p" NEGISTRATION closes 'September 26. Every
I â / citizen who has not been registered since Jan
uary 1 must register now or he will forfeit his
rieht to vote.

DEBUTANTES: QUARTET OF PRETTY
AND BEWITCHING BUDS
QUARTET OF PRETTY
AND BEWITCHING BUDS
The people of the Eastern and the Southern States
understand that fact and return the same men to Con
gress year after year. The consequence is that some
of the smaller of these States have a prestige at Wash
ington altogether out of proportion totheir wealth and
population. California in the past has been neglectful
of that political wisdom. We have changed our Con
gressmen so often that hardly any one of them has
had a chance to show the full measure of his capacity.
The people of the Fifth District some years ago
ceased to make a change at every Congressional elec
tion and in consequence they have now a Representa
tive who holds the important position of chairman of
the Committee on Postoffices and Postroads. The
people of the Seventh will do well to profit by the
example. The re-election of Mr. Needham ought to
be assured by the vote of every Republican, of every
independent and of every sound-money Democrat in
his district.
In addition to that advantage, the older
members of the House have others even more
important. Like all organized bodies having a long
and illustrious history, the House of Representatives,
despite its Republican character, is governed by a
species of etiquette and precedence of its own. In the
formation of committees a new man has no chance of
getting a chairmanship, no matter how brilliant he
may be. Every aspirant for leadership in the House
must serve an apprenticeship in a somewhat subor
dinate capacity. If he proves to be a man of marked
ability he is promoted rapid]}', but he never gets
promotion until he has been tried.
It will be perceived from that record that Mr. Need
ham has been unusually successful for a new mem
ber. No man during his first term at Washington
can do much more than show his zeal on behalf of
his constituents. The House of Representatives is
dominated by men who have been in office for years.
These men are bound to one another not only by the
ties of long friendship, but by the obligations of many
mutual services, and as a consequence they naturally
assist one another where such assistance is needed.
1 hey do not constitute a clique in the common ac
ceptation of the word, nor have they any antagonism
to new men; but the amount of money to be appro
priated in any one year is limited, and where a conflict
occurs between the claims of one of the older mem
bers and a near member they vote, as a matter of
course, with the man whom they have kndwn longest
and to whom they are indebted for past favors.
Among the measures of importance to his con
stituents and to all California which he supported
and whose enactment was largely due to his efforts
are: The grant of an appropriation for the enlarge
ment of the quarantine station at San Diego; an ap
propriation for the Indian School, whose maintenance
is of considerable value not only to the Indians, but
to the people of Riverside, who derive a considerable
business from it; the increase of the appropriation for
irrigation surveys from $50,000 to $ico,ooo; an ap
propriation of $125,000 for improving the access to the
Grant and the Sequoia National parks; an appropria
tion for a survey of the San Joatjuin River; a bill to
establish a Federal Court at Fresno, and the estab
lishment of upward of twenty rural mail routes in his
district.
In all the great party struggles in the House during
the last session Mr: Needham was an able and. stal
wart upholder of the policies of the Republican party
The administration had no firmer supporter and the
Republicanism of California no. advocate ' more
faithful. His energies, however, were not confined to
the contests over party issues. Being thoroughly
alive to the requirements of his constituents and the
interests of California, Mr. Needham achieved a large
amount of work beneficial to his district and to the
State.
AMONG the Congressional districts in this State
where the people have the choice of re-electing
a Republican who has been tried in office, or of
electing a new man representing Bryanism, is the
Seventh. In that district the Republicans have re
nominated the Hon. James C. Needham, and in mak
ing the contest require no other campaign document
than the record of his official service.
THE CONTEST IN THE SEVENTH.
all should support him. The northern and eastern
wings of his party declare free coinage to be a dead
issue, the southern wing of his party declares anti
imperialism to be a humbug, while the magnates of
the ice trust and the express trust wink at one an
other and smile when he denounces 4 trusts. On what
ground ,has he a right to ask for votes?

From early morning till late yesterday
afternoon members of the Carpenters'

the good work of erecting a new planing
mill for Searle &Hayman to replace the
one burned to the ground about two
weeks ago. About fifty carpenters work
ed on the building and they did not stop
a moment, but kept right at It. Some of
the men were busy packing in lumber,
others erected the uprights and as soon
as that was completed still others finish
ed tho walls.
The mill is located at Fourteenth and
Harrison streets, and from the appear

complete the building. Some of those who
worked on the structure were T. Tobln,

DIES FEOM ' EFFECTS OF
AN ACCIDENTAL WOUND
Frank Cullen, a Clerk in the Wells,
Fargo & Co. Bank, Passes
Away.
Frank Cullen, a well-known employe of
the "Wells, Fargo & Co. Bank, died
yesterday in the Lane Hospital from the
effects of a wound received nearly three
months ago in a runaway accident.
The young man and a party of friends
were camping in the Yosemlte Valley in
June last, when Cullen was thrown from
a wagon drawn by a team of runaway
horses and had one leg badly crushed.
He was brought to this city, where the
best medical skill was called in to save
his life. The wound, however, refused to
heal, but grew steadily worse, finally
causing his death.
(emss^HIj Police Commlslon Is likely to

â¢ i The sternly Eedate gentlemen
who guide the moral destinies of
the city are to go on the carpet
and explain another wonder of their ad
ministration. Hidden away in tho maze
of items cf expense for furnishing the
Hall of Justice is one, modest enough in
amount, but startling in principle. It is
the cost for supplying the photographs of
the Police Commission for the Hall of
Justice.
Tho scrutinising eyes of Supervisors,
keen to detect extravagance, saw thl3
charge against the city and a fieterrhineu
effort will be made to throw it out. The
Supervisors do not wish a mlsunderstand-

the range of probability that the little

But the Supervisors insist that there Is
a place for everything, even the pictures

for all of these worthy adornments. The
cost, they say, should be borne by the
Police Department fund and entered In
ths category of municipal luxuries, for
it Is deemed a luxury to have constantly
before one's eyes tha classic beauty of
the Police Commission. It has been sug
gested also that a composite photograph
of the commission might be made In the
Interest of science, as well as of art.
Â¦While the SujArvisors wish to encourage
the esthetic ii!Sis of the Police Commis
sion, the City Fathers emphatically de
cline to pay the bills. Supervisor Hotal
ing, whose economic eye has discovered
the Item of expense, felt that he was
treading on delicate ground yesterday
when ho, discussed the matter. He wanted
it to be distinctly understood that he con
siders the faces of the Police Commission
things of beauty and a joy forever, but
he ventured the opinion that their pic
tured glories belong in the police gallery
at the expense of the Police Department.
He will, therefore, insist that the item
of cost for these photographs be cut out
of the bill for furnishing the Hall of Jus
tice. It Is sincerely to be hoped that
the Police Commissioners will not get on
their dignity and deprive that part of the
public which has access to the police gal
lery of a vision of these prospective beau
ties.

That Yoti Get So Much of Up at
Tahoe.
The oldest Californian cheerfully bears
witness that he has never known such a
persistently perfect summer and autumn
season as In this blessed year of our Lord
1900.
And especially is this true of the moun
tain uistriets, where the temperature la
delightfully equable and the air so pur-j
and cri.^p that it fairly snaps.
It is this unusually inviting condition
that prompts the transportation com
panies interested to arrar.se for another
popular excursion to Lake Tahoe. the
tickets to be HO for the round trip and al
lowing throe days at the lake. Those who
can take full advantage of this chance
should go Friday evening. September iv
and return on the following Tuesday; but
the tickets will be good on Saturday even
ing also.
The glories of Tahoe and Its rugged en
vironment are simply matchless and this
very cheap rate puts them within evtry
body's reach.
INJTJRED SAN RAFAEL
MAN IS IDENTrFTED
Name Is J. M. Lowe and It Is Be
lieved He Was Struck by a
Runaway Horse.
Special DUpntch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL. Sept. 23.â The old man
Â¦who was found lying unconscious last
night at the entrance to tbe Hotel Rafael
grounds, was identified at an early hour
this morning as J. M. Lowe. The identi
fication took place at Dr. II. O. Howitt'a.
where the injured man was being cared
for, and waa made by his aged wife. Mr.
Lowe is the father-in-law of Henry
Eickoff.' the well known San Francisco
attorney. He is 82 years of age and his
wife is the same age. They are occupy
ing the Eickoff home here for the winter
tt is not believed that Mr. Lowe is fatally
Injured. He rested easily to-day, but
sould not be removed 10 nls home.
The manner in which he met with tha
accident is still a mystery. Rumors of a
tvhite horse attached to a cart and muk
ng a wild dash down the street have been
heard, but no one can be found who saw
i runaway. The authorities made care
ful Inquiry to-day but could learn nothing.
rhe supposition is that a reckless driver
ran the aged man down and was too
cowardly to stop. Mr. Lowe so far has
tjeen u.nable to say how. he was injured.

CliARENCTE HAIGHT WON
COLEMAN CLUB TROPHY
Exciting Shoot at Ingleside by Mem-
bers of the San Francisco
Gun Club
One of the most stubbornly contested
shooting contests that ever took place at
the Ingleside grounds was held yester
day in the Coleman cup event. The cup
was won by Clarence Haight, who de
feated M. O. Feudner by one bird. The
match was a twenty-five bird shoot, and
sixteen members of the San Francisco
Gun Club contested. Seven tied and then
shot off for ten birds. Haight and Feud
ner both killed seven birds in succession.
Then both missed the eighth, but Haight
won on the tenth. Clarence Nauman,
who was the favorite in the contest, grew
careless toward the end and missed birds
that he had no business in allowing to
get outside of. the boundary. Following
are the scores:

by the yachlsmeri on the shore. Kongs
were sung, ttories told and an allrouml
pleasant time passed.
Yesterday a race took place between
the yawl Kittiwake, the sloop Doris and
the catboat Caprice, which was won easily
by the Kittiwake. Seventeen or e'ghteen.
boats flying the Corinthian burgee lay
at anchor in Paradise Cove during the
day. â¢
Kx-Commodore T. L. Hill's sloop Cygnus
cruised up to McNear's Landing on Sat
urday night, where ex-Commodore J. W.
Pew's sloop Truant lay at anchor. On
Sunday R. S. Bridgeman'H sloop Thetis
wi*h a party dropped hook at the same
place. Nearly all the San Francisco fleet
waa cruising- in the upper bay, among
the boats under way being the steam
iyacht El Primero, the flagship Ramona,
the schooners Lurline and Chlspa, the
yawls Tramontana (returning from a trip
to Port Costa) and Phyllis, the cutter Fol
ly and the sloops Thetis. Catherine, Sap
pho, Surprise, Rover and Siren. The Si
ren had on board a party of ladles from
Napa City, who are the guests of some
well-known yachtsmen of Sausalito.
The breeze out from Sausallto in the
morning was fresh and steady, but on the
return trip it fell light and fluky. On
the ebb tide, however, all the yachts made
their moorings in good time.

Russell, Allen & "Wilson's Victor Boy
won the deciding course in the open i
stake at San Mateo Park yesterday, with
P. Jackson's Golden Russet as runner-up.
The winner was quoted a favorite in his j
courses except in tne last two rounds. In i
the. sixth against Pat Reiily"s Honesty
the talent forced Victor Boy on the short
end at 6 to 1, but miscalculated, for when
the h;*re escaped the black dog had a
point the better of his opponent. Then
with 2 to 1 against him in the deciding
course the Boy landed for his backers.
From the slips he took a slight lead on
Golden Russet and held it to the turn,
lie- did all of the work until the hare
turned down the Held, when the runner
up joined In and made five points, includ
ing the kill.
Flora McDonald did clever work until !
she met Honesty in the fifth round.
Though she was beaten pointless In this j
go, it was through favor of the hare. She ;
was possessed of speed and many liked j
her chances for the stake, but luck was j
against her. A good play was made on j
this course and 5 to 1 was freely offered ,
with Flora as a favorite. As stated, lion- :
esty went out to Victor Boy in his next
course. The hares were a strong lot and
gave the dogs some hard runs. Several
of the entries were withdrawn on account
of severe coursing.
Smuggler" was given' hard work. He
beat Athena in a grueling course, but
came back in the next round and gut the
decision against Talk to Me, a 4 to 1 fa
vorite, after a grueling go all over the
Held.
Several other short ends landed at good
odds. The card furnished interesting
sport.

J. Sutton's clever greyhound Mayflower
sot a gruelling pace in her first course in
the Open Stake at Union Park yesterday
and kept it up until she won the flag from
Handy's-Twin City Girl in the final round.
There is no disputing the tact that the
winner had the speed over all of her op
ponents and In every go the game daugh
ter of St. Lawrence showvd her willing
ness to display all the running there was
in her. Barring a bye with Rollicking
Airs, a fresh dog, she allowed but two
points to be scored against her by Wedgt
wood, and with the others she won u.s Â»hd
pleased.
The coursing throughout the stake was
of high class, and five of the greyhounds
were put out of the running on account
of severe work. Rural Artist showed the
effects of Saturday's work and was with
drawn in the second round. The speedy
Palo Alto, a strong favorite for linal
honors, got a hard course in that round,
with Liberator, and was scratched trom
further going, and Annie Hall and Wai
path shared a like fate. .Brutus, too,
further on in the stake, went a killing
pace with Sweetness, wnich left him un

"Count me cut of it." said the leader
< :' the beer forces gathered in the cage
to trhovt. for the Dudes. "After filling
yon with joy what does this fellow Moskf-
KBSXl do but pet pincned or. third just as
he i^ about to make a clean steal and win
the ga:r,t : Thut's; what 1 call the dude act
ai: over. Doesn't it make you sick?"
The brigadier general of the beer force*
became so incensed after this lingual ox
plosion that he refused to order.
In the eighth inning of the same %t
Recreation grounds ytsterday afternoon
OaklandJ two runs in the rear of Sacra
rncnto. tied the score. One man had per-
Isned when Hutchir.fcon and Francks
brand themselves on the sacks after a
< maple of hits. Moskimaji's chance to win
i :> own game had come. Like a streak
ti.e i>Â«ill left his bat. too fast for Kutran
or anybody else to stop Its career. When
tbe ball reached the infield Hutchinson
and Krancks had runs registered against
Utem and Moskiman *ras throwing com-
X.'lime:its at himseJtf or. third. Then he got
pay and stayed too far from the sack.
1 toyle threw to Devertaux and Moskiman
dud where he stood. The team was retired
tno:i after.
â¢And 1 did all the good work." cried the
fanatic between swallows. "I started the
crowd yellir.g and hooting. Why, we had
DiiyJe down nine seconds. It was a cinch
that Moskiman would have scored and
after that shew me the' toga snorter who
would have got a hit eft Moskiman. A1J
the easy money burned to cinders. I'd
five 69 cents If I were a baseball man-
BÂ» r. 1
The friends of the brigadier sympathized
with thoir leader and smiled sad re
sponses. For seven Innings the game
drupgt-d along in uninteresting slowness.
The turbulent eighth tied the score. The
ninth settled It. Held did a wild throw
stunt that gave Eagan two bases and
Ful>se<"juÂ»Â»nt!v scored him. That was the
end <jf all.
Truck Kagan made a hero of himself in
more ways than one. He knocked the ball
over the left field fence for the first time
1n a professional game. Only once before
was this done on the groundsâ by Young
of Stanford in a game with California
three years ago. Besides this Eagan got
a double and a sinplf and made phenom
enal stops at short that forced the fanat
ics off the lienchep.
Kitpans drive kept Bowman moving
fctutward from the time the ball left the
bat until it scaled the dizzy Emporium
sign. Bowman was bewildered. The bags
were cloar when Eagan rolled out the
homer. The score Is:

KORNING GAME.
Oakland 6, Sacramento 3.
T'ntil the seventh inning at Oakland yes
terday morning "Redaog" Devereaux's
twirling was enough to keep Ewlng's men
lnird at work on guessing contests. Then
the c-yo? of the Dudes came to a suddÂ«n
awakening and they began to unravel the
twirlÂ«=-r from Sacramento for small
I'unctips of hits. Ewir.g'F new discoveries,
Hf-ld ami Bowman, were kings of the stick
brigade, the former getting a homer and
a two-bagEer. the latter a three-sack hit.
The score shows the first portion of the
n!nth inriinsr up to the time the game was
railed. In reality the score is, Oakland 4.
Ep.rramento 3. the laÂ«t inning being re

of San Francisco. It is said they shot for
a box of canned lobsters. Black won out
by half a bird. . -

effort to capture the club's tamale medal.
Decourtieux won. Salvador Pacheco, Ira
Parks and T. J. Lennon next shot for the
club's rabbit foot trophy. Lennon broke
the most birds, but the match vras given
to Pacheco because he broke a disc and
filled a brown cow with the balance of the
shot.
"Chick" Doody and E. B. Martinelli
shot a great match of â¢ ten birds.
Doody broke his ten birds and Martlrtelll
killed nine. It was afterward learned that

loaded with double B. and the medal was
awarded to Martinelli.
Fred Carroll, the old baseball star, and
W. E. Robertson shot a fifteen-bird
match. Carroll won. breaking fourteen to

and T. J. Fallon met with a peculiar mis
hap. Before the shooting they wandered
up on the hill with their guns to get a
little practice. They saw what they
thought was a coon's nest in an oak tree,
and both let drive. Fallon tame near
drowning in a water hole where he sought

TOMMY CROWLEY NOW
WHITEHALL CHAMPION
Wins the Hesailed Admission Day-
Contest With Seven Lengths
to Spare.
One of the most exciting races between
Whitehall boats ever seen on the bay I
was sailed yesterday. "Tommy" Crowley
won by a safe margin, but the second,
third and fourth boata were so close to
gether at the finish that it required a de
cision from the 4 udge to piace them. Jim
Sennett's and Dave Crowley Sr.'a boats
were in collision and Sennett claimed a I
foul, but it was not allowed, and the
judges placed the boats as follows: !
'â¢Tommy" Crowley, first; Dave Crowley j
St., second; W. Clark, third; James Sen- I
nett, fourth; Charles Price nfth.
The Whitehall race was the outcome of !
the Native Sons' celebration. On the oc- j
casion of the lirst race "Tommy" Crow
ley won In pood style, but he had placed
a canva3 half deck on his Whitehall and
that made trouble among the other com
petitors. Objections poured in on the re-
Katta committee, so it was decided to sail
the race over again. There waa a big
crowd out to see the contest, and the
Governor Markham carried at. least 100
spectators.
From the start Tommy Crowley held
the place. On the run home he came
along without his spinnaker, while his
father with all sail set tried in vain to
catch him. By a very clever piece of ma
neuvering "Old Man" Crowley blanketed
Billy Clark's Whitehall and managed to
slip in half a boat's length ahead. Half
a length away came Jimmy Sennett, and
lapped on the latter was~Charley Price.
There were seven boats in the race and
Tommy Crowley assumed a commanding
lead from the first. Rounding Blossom
Rock, he had the race won and off Pow
ell-street wharf he had a three-minute
lead. From that on It was only a ques
tion of by how many blocks he would win.
In the run home he reduced sail in order
to give the other boats a chance to come
up.
The foul claimed by Sennett occurred
while rounding the Presidio buoy. The
committee decided that Dave Crowley Sr.
lost more by the misadventure than did
Sennett.

XMJS SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1UOU.
THERE â¢wÂ«Â»rÂ» >Â«oTne exciting scenes
at Ansel I^iand quarantine sta
ticp. during the detention of the
mail steamer Moana. Many moons
apo' bubonic plagrue wag epi
rUmto in Sydney. N. S. W.. and ever
since steamer* from that point have been
detained hero for fumigation. Strange to
fi-v. thÂ»Â» pa. c songâ¬>re from Auckland (N>w
Zealand) and -Apia (Samoa) are landed
as soon as they reach port, while the
Australian passengers, who have been
mixing with them for three weeks, have
to he fumigated.
It is the fumigating question that has
raised all the trouble. There are no fe
ma'.e attendant* at the Angel Inland sta
tion, and the doctors and hosplta.1 stew
ards handled all the baggage. Several
women fainted and others went' Into hys
trrics when the latter unceremoniously
(mpil^d valises and trunks of female ap
parel and threw the contents Into the
tUslnl^cUns vat. The travelers evidently
thought thftir wearing apparel was to be
i!c--.troyed before their eyes.
DEMOCRATS HAVE AN OUTING.
Commissioners Kerold and Harney
Take a Party Around the Bay.
A number of leading politicians of the
Democratic party had an outing on the
bay yesterday. They were the guests of
Harbor Commissioners Harney and Her
cld. and had a most enjoyable trlD around
the bay. Among those who went out on
the State tug Governor Markham were:
Gavin McNab. Dr. Dudge, T. P. \V. Le
: land and D. M. Delmas. A number of
ladles who accompanied the party tended
to make the excursion more of a social
j than a political event. The affair was a
| most enjoyable one.
Chief Engineer McCaig Honored.
; D. McCaig, chief engineer of the mail
i steamer Moana, has a host of friends, not
i only in San Francisco, but In every port
' the steamship stops at throughout Aus
| tralla. New Zealand, Samoa and Hawaii.
I He was chief engineer of the Monowal
j when that vessel took the first New Zea
! land contingent to South Africa, and
when he was transferred to the Moana
his friends showered tokens of their
favor on him. When the vessel was at
Auckland, on the way here, the engineers
gave him a splendid send-off and a pres
ent of a watch and- chain. The watch
bears the inscription. "Presented to D.
MeCaig from his juniors on the occasion
of his leaving the ,Monowal to take charge
of the- Moana."
Water Front Notes.
John Henry went to the pump that
feeds the steamers of the Santa Fe sys
tem yesterday to get a drink of water.
He turned the water on, and, while
stooping over to quench his thirst,
lost his balance and fell overboard.
Postal Clerks Collins and . Asmus
sen of Station D went to his assist
ance, but had It not 1 been for the help ren-
dered by the crew of the Ocean Spray-
John would have drowned.
The Alaska Commercial Company's St.
Paul arrived from Cape Nome yesterday
via Seattle. Among the passengers was
Mrs. E. O. Tuttle. She went north to
meet her husband, but missed him on the
way. Mr. Tuttle was at the wharf to
meet her. All the news the St. Paul
brought from the gold fields was tele
graphed from Seattle.
The work of discharging the German
liner Herodot went on all of yesterday.
There Is a great rush of outward cargo,
and an attempt will be made to get the
steamer away on time.
All the sick from the transport'Grant
were taken to the Presidio on tho tug Res
olute yesterday. The discharged soldiers
were landed during the afternoon and
taken to the various hotels. The Grant
goes on the drydock to-day, and will take
the Algoa's place at Folsom-street next
Thursday.
Joseph Walsh of C05 Battery street was
treated at the Harbor Hospital yesterday
by Drs. Robinson and Bauer for a serious
razor cut on the back of the neck. It
appears that Walsh got into an altercation
with his landlord, and the latter used the
razor. Sergeant Ellis was In the hospital
when Walsh was â¢ brought In, and he is

FRESNO, Sept. 23.â The Belgian Hare
Emporium, a corporation with several
thousand dollars of capital stock, organ
ized a few months ago by a number of
wealthy society ladies, closed its t!oors
yesterday. The failure of the concern
was the result of the dying out of the
Belgian hare craze, which was at Its
height when the emporium started.
Shortly after the organization of the
corporation tho promoters sent represen
tatives to Los Angelea and other places
to study BelKian hare conditions.
Experts were employed at fancy sal
aries and the best stock obtainable was
procured. For a while the venture was
highly successful and many profitable
sales were made. The purchasers suffered,
however, and their experience was a
warning to others not to buy. Soon the
emporium found it impossible to make
further local sates and tried sending 1
agents to the East. This also proved a.
failure and the lo/lles finally decided to go
out of business. The stock on hand was
given ,to a local fancier of the animals.
While in existence the company had one
of the most expensive halls in the city as
headquarters.

he had been for three months confined in
one of Nome City's Inhospitable hospitals,
the serious nature of his Illness had been
concealed from his friends at home, and
vesterday there was a host of them at the

at Oakland, it prostrated her.

parents declare that there was absolutely

was not suspected that the girl had left
her home. As the hours rolled by and she
was still missing, the tension upon the
anxious parents was intense. Mrs. Sturm
broke down and her condition, it is feared
will soon become very critical unless the

Last Wednesday morning Loretta. went
to her sister's room and took a sealskin
coat and some other smaller articles of
wearing apparel. With her ordinary street
garments the girl departed, saying not a
word to any one in the house.
There had been no jars or domestic dis
turbance to drive her away. The family
relations were particularly pleasant. The
Cirl. had been a little home body, quiet
and retlned. She had no inclinations, so
far as the family is aware, that would
cause her to go astray.

Before the Presidential election of 1SP2
another important political issue had
made its advent Into the field of serious
political discussion. The silver question
ha* been referred to as holding political
attention since a few years after the
dropping of the sllvÂ«r dollar in 1*73. Only
paper money was then In actual circula
tion, as was also the case five years later,
when the IJland-Allison law was passed
for the coinage of standard silver dollars
at a fixed rate per month. On the resump
tion of specie payments In 1S79 both gold
and silver returned to circulation and
both were legal tender for all debts. Sil
ver was coined in limited quantities â from
J2.000.0oo to &MO,M0 each month. The bul
lion for the purpose was purchased by the
I'nited States Treasury and the dollar*
were coined on Government account.
Prior to this time the silver question hail
not been made strictly a party issue. Both
parties proftssed to desire to place the
silver dollar upim the same tasis as tho
gold dollar, and to this end the Federal
Government sought the co-operaton of
European nations for the establishment
of international bimetallism. The attempt
proved a failure. The states of Kurope
would not give their consent to the bi
metallic experiment. One after another
they discarded silver and established, the
single gold standard.
Meantime a sentiment in favor of an
entirely free and unlimited coinage of the
silver dollar was becoming insistent in the
United States. This sentiment wa.>
especially strong in the newly admitted
Rocky Mountain States, where the min
ing of silver was a leading industry.
The floods of campaign oratory with
which the country was inundated In 18SS
in defense of the Republican principle of
protection developed the doctrine that all
American industries should share in the
fostering care of the paternal Govern
ment. The McKinley bill was an effort
to embody the prevailing sentiment of
the Republican campaign, and its authors
did not step with placing duties on im
ported goods. When convinced that it
would be politic to remove the duty upon
imported sugar they made provision for
reimbursing the American producers of
sugar for their loss of the additional price
which the duty hud created by presenting
them with a bounty to be paid out of the
Federal treasury. What could be more
natural than for the owners of silver
mines to desire to share in such liberality
of a generous government? The Con
gress which passed the new tariff law was
sensitive to indications of such aspira
tion?, and with prompt responsiveness
passed a statute providing for the pur
chase by th<? l*nite<l States of all silver
produced by American mines. As first
introduced the bill contained provisions
for the free and unlimited coinage of sil
ver into dollars having full legal tender,
but before its passage the bill wan so
modified as to require only the purchase
by the Government of 4.5uO.0<iO ounces of
silver a month (the whole of the output
of American <"ilvÂ«>r mines at that time>.
Instead of obliging the Government to
coin the purchased bullion into dollars,
the amended law permitted the Issue of
silver certificates, which were made full
legal tender and became part of the cur
rent money of thÂ« republic.
The tariff legislation of Harrison's term
was of a strictly partisan character, and
was uniformly opposed by all the Dem
ocrats. With the silver legislation It was
far otherwise. To that the most persis
tent opposition came from within tna Re
publican party. Republicans also gave
it strong support, particularly those from
the mining States, and a very large pro
portion of the Democrats favored it.
Party lines were curiously obscured.
Great outcry had been madÂ© against thÂ«
Republicans for their demonetization of
silver, and Republican Presidents had al
ways stood in the way of the restoration,
of free coinage. At the same time both
parties adopted platforms which professed
to desire the continued use of silver on
an equality with gold. And all the time
there were In each party a few professed
gold monometalllsts. along -with others
who leaned less decidedly in the same di
rection. In general It appeared that those
Democrats who were most pronounced
free traders were also in favor of thÂ«
single gold standard. JESSE MACI.

revolution In respect to party ascendency.
The McKlnley bill became Inw, but th*
members of that Congress which passed t
were speedily called to judgment by tht>
voters. The next House of Representa
tives was overwhelmingly Democratic,
and as rapidly as regular processes per
mitted, the Senate and Presidency fol
lowed.
When the McKlnley law went Into oper
ation in October, 1.S90. the country was up
on the high tide of commercial prosperity,
and that comfortable condition lasteu
throughout Harrison's administration,
laborers were employed at remunerative
wages; business made ample returns; tho
general range of prices was satisfactory 1 !
and the future outlook was favorable. la
accordance with time honored custom the
party at the moment in power laid claim
to the credit f-tr the prosperous state of
affairs, and tho financial and Indusriai
policy of the Harrison Government was
glorified and exalted as having wrought
the marvel.
Naturally, the new Democratic Housn
elected In 1S90 felt that they had been
chosen and commissioned for the express
purpose of attacking the new tariff law.
and measures were introduce! for chang
ing some of the Items of the Republican
tariff, such as duties upon, raw material*
âwool in particular.
fl/YlEÂ«ICAN POLITICAL PARTIES.
VVTTT
The Civil Service.
President Cleveland found the task of
eatlBfylnjf those who had elected him to
the Presidency a difficult one. The "mug
wump" contingent among his supporters
expected him to adhere to the cause oi
civil service reform and refuse to make
removals from office for partisan reasons.
On the other hand the Democrats, after
a quarter of a century of exclusion from
any share in the Government patronage,
came In large numbers to demand what
they deemed their rights. An angel from
heaven, guided by celestial wisdom, could
rot have gratified both factions; neither
did Cleveland, though he made the at
tempt. Civil service reform was advanced,
though lesa rapidly than its advocates
had hoped, and partisan removals wen
made that Democratic office seekers might
be Installed, so that In course of the
Presidential term Republicans were very
generally "weeded out" of the ctticea not
Included under civil service rules.
The Tariff in tte Campaign of 1888.
The most important acts of Cleveland's
first administration were those bearing
upon the tariff. The annual message pre-
KÂ«-nted to the Fiftieth Congress In Decem
ber 1SS7. dealt solely with the subject of
tariff reform. The next election was al
ready in sight. Cleveland and Blalne were
txpected again to contest the. Presidency
before the country, and an issue must be
determined upon. The message of 1SS7
made that issue tariff reform, and tho
Republicans readily took up the gag^ thus
thrown down. They had been fortunate in
previous campaigns In their use of ques
tions of finance, and they were sanguine
of success once more in a tariff contest.
Republicans therefore squared themselves
to fight the election of 1SSS on that line.
Mr. Blaine published a newspaper mes
sage setting forth the Republican doc
trine of protection, while the Democrats
endeavored to tolidify their forces for ef
fective service by making the acceptance
of the administration tariff measures the
essential prerequisite for the bestowal or
official favors.
After the smoke of battle had cleared
away the Republicans found that their ad
vocacy of the party views of tariff ques
tions,"with even an intensified emphas s of
the element of protection, had given them
not only the Presidency but the control
of both houses of Congress. They felt
themselves therefore under obligations to
promote legislation in favor of tariff re
form in the direction of further protection
to American industries.
The McKinley Bill.
Three months of genuine debate within
the party over the proposed tariff legisla
tion worked a most sudden and sweeping
The second Harrison entered the "White
House in March, 1SS3, and the new Repub
lican tariff law did not take effect until
more than a year and a half later. The
McKlnley bill v.as drawn to embody the
views of the party leaders which had been
developed in the opposition to the position
set forth in the Cleveland message of
1SS7. It was in effect a considerable ex
tension of the protective system. Con
gress debated the bill at tedious length,
and it received an unusual amount of at
tention from the general public. Demo
crats strenuously resisted the measure,
and unexpected opposition appeared
among Republicans themselves.
The campaign discussion of the tariff
issue had been very far from a fair and
candid consideration of the actual merits
of the opposing policies. The appeal had
been rather to prejudice and passion than
to the intelligence of the voter. Repub
lican orators accused the Democrats of
aimir.g at absolute free trade, of favor
ing a dangerous, revolutionary and un-
Ainerican' policy imported from England
and in which British capitalists and man
ufacturers took a deep personal interest.
Democratic sneakers arraigned their op
ponents in their turn as being of deliber
ate choice committed to a course of sys
tematic robbery of the people under the
deceptive guise of protection to American
industries. No truly educative treatment
of the tariff question which effectively
reached the rank and file of the voting
population had taken place until Repub
licans themselves, both In Congress and
throughout the country, engaged in a dis
cussion of the McKinley bill. Then, for
the first time, the Republican voter gain
ed insight into the true character of the
war tariff, which was for the most part
still In force. He began to realize his
burden of daily taxation for the support
of a war ended nearly a quarter of a cen
tury before. The newspapers, by their
long and persistent presentation, day
after day and week after week, of the
arguments advanced in Congress for and
against the bill, with comments thereon,
according to their own light and leading,
did able service for the education of the
people In economic principles. The Re
publicans of the North-west read with
careful study the detailed discussions
given in their own Republican papers of
the effects of the existing duties upon ar
ticles of daily consumption. The criti
cisms from the pens of party leaders still
in good party standing upon the absurd
ities of certain of the existing forms of
taxation saddled upon the country
through the accidents of war and still
continued when the need was long past
appealed to their reason and business
sense, and prepared for the high-tariff
advocates such a surprise as they were
not soon able to forcet.

engine had gone through Mulcahy was
Inside the clip clinging to the piles.
Where the engine went through the
wharf Is a great jagged opening, not
larger than the length of the engine, but
fringed with torn and splintered timbers,
which testify to the force with which the
heavy machine crushed through them.
The rails were twisted and brokfjn. the
piles were driven into the bottom And the
heavy beams and braces were snapped
like so many twigs.
The bottom at Point Richmond Is of
sand. It was thought when the wharf
was built that it was a solid foundation
and even now the theory is advanced that
the engine found a soft place. The
switch, up to two weeks ago. was used by
every engine that went on the wharf,
and beyond the creaking of the sleepers
under the rails, there was no sign of the
fatal weakness. %
Where the engine went through the wa
ter Is thirty feet deep. There are no
broken pile3 In sight, indicating; that they
were driven straight down by the weight,
and there Is no sign of the engine. Part
of the roof of the cab floats among the
wreckage, but the engine Itself is far un
der the swells that roll so unconcernedly
over It. And the fireman Is somewhere
with It. Whether he was crushed be
tween the engine and the cab and killed
before the water closed over him. or
whether he was pinned there, still alive, to
be drowned under the wharf, is some
thing his erstwhile comrade, the engineer,
cannot tell.
The fireman lived in Stockton, where he
was the support of his mother and sister.
He and Allen had been running on 203
almost from the opening of the road to
the bay and they were great friends. The
first words of the engineer when he re
gained consciousness after being pulled
from the water were. my part

The third lies with the engine five fath

The engine was No. 203 of the Bakere
f eld run, anfl it had for its crew William
Allen, epgineer, and P. S. (or "Doc") Ad
ams, fireman. It was Adams who 'was
killojj.
The train, with 203 pulling it. had just
enme in from Bakersflcld and the passen
pers had gone onto the boat, which had
loft the slip. The track upon Â¦which the
train rur.s In continues on past the sta
tion-hou5e and down along the slip, where
It switches Into the back track by Â¦which,
up to two weeks ago, engines reached the
yard, a mile up the road from the wharf.
Two weclcs ago, however, it came to the
knowledge of the management that the
Â«harf was not safe, and Immediately an
order forbidding engines to go down on
the wharf was posted on the bulletin
Voard in the yard. In the face of this
crUer there was nothing for an engineer
to do after having brought his train In
but lo wait until the passengers wore all
Â«v.;t of thÂ« carÂ« and then back the whole
train up the trcek to the yard, for there
I? no other way except through the switch
down on the wharf.
When the train got In from Bakersfield
yesterday morning E. K. Mulcahy. the tel
rgraph operator at the wharf, was ready
for breakfast, and Allen agreed to un
couple his engine and take the operator
up to the yard for his meal, leaving thÂ»
train at the wharf. Mulcahy boarded the
locomotive and it started down to the
pwitch. It was going very flowly by the
time It reached the switch, an-1 it â¢was
about to stop when the wharf commenced
to go.
The ragineer** Fide was clear and he

Brown and I had come over the night be

there was no one round to help those men

Adams was still with the engine.
It is probable that the engine can bo
raised without much trouble. Attempts
will be made to raise it at once, and to
find the body of the fireman it carried
with it down to his death.
The order that engines should 'not go
down the wharf was posted in the yard,
but no one except one engineer on the
wharf yesterday knew much about it, and
he knew only that it had been posted and
that it referred to that end of the track.
There was no obstruction placed across
the track, so the way to the switch was
free for any engineer who wished to
travel it.
We ran back at once and were just In
time to help the two men out of the
water."
The body of George C. Tietjen, a com
mercial traveler representing the West
ern Implement Company of Port Wash
ington, Wls., was found in room 232 of
the Grand Hotel late yesterday afternoon.
Life had been extinct for nearly two days.
The cause of death is supposed to have
been heart disease, from which Tietjen was
apparently suffering when he retired Fri
day night. The remains were taken in
charge by Deputy Coroners Thomas Smith
and Patrick Flynn and an inquest will be
held. A letter written to Tietjen by his
wife, who resides in Wisconsin, contains

a presentiment of his death. The woman
inquired anxiously after her husband's
health and said she had dreamed three
times that he was dead, which caused her
much anxiety.
Tietjen came from New York, and
registered at the Grand Hotel on Sep
tember 20. He was afflicted with a weak
heart and on Friday his health was so
poor that he was obliged to procure medi
cine. Friday night he retired and told tiie
bellboy in the hotel of his illness, at tne
same time remarking that he hoped noth
ing would happen to him so far away from
home and while he was among strangers.
Nothing more was heard from the com
mercial traveler until yesterday after
noon, when a sickening odor coming from
his apartments lead to an Investigation.
The door of the room was opened and
Tietjen's body was found-on the bed.
From all appearances, life had been ex
tinct for about two days. The Coroner's
office was notified and the remains taken
to the Morgue. The dead man's money,
amounting to nearly $50, and a valuable
gold watch had been taken charge of by
the hotel people. As the law requires
that a body shall remain untouched until
the proper authorities take it in charge,
the hotel men were warned to be more
caroful In the future.
Tietjen was about 50 years of age. Lit

It is understood that Santa Cruz will
make an unusual effort on this occasion
to entertain her visitorsâ at which, by the
way, she is proficient in a high degree,
and something quite out of the ordinary
may be expected in the way of pleasure.
William H. Menton will be the com
pany's hospitable host, the knowledge of
which Is always reassuring. The colonel
enjoys the proud distinction of having
managed excursions aggregating hun
dreds of thousands without having had a
single serious accident. So go and enjoy
yourselves.
While a large crowd is comfortably
handled to and fro by the company's am
ple equipment, it is never pleasant to be
jostled about by a large number who are
all trying- to purchase tickets at the same
time. So go early and avoid the rush.
There Is every probability that thou
sands of people will be of one mind on
September 30â that Is. to go to Santa Cruz
on the grand $2 excursion which the

Hamilton' considers his escape from be
ing shot nothing short of miraculous. His
desperate assailant, lie says, stood only
a few feet from him and. pointing the re
volver at his breast, deliberately fired.
Notwithstanding nls danger Hamilton
grabbed his murderous assailant just as
he was about to flre a second shot and
struck him on the head with his club.
Before he could disarm him the third man
started to assault Hamilton, but seeing
that he was up against it he sought safe
ty in flight. In the meantime the man
with the revolver, evidently thinking the
bullet had struck the groceryman, re
placed the weapon in his pocket and ran
down Folsom street. On returning to his
store Hamilton found the man who first
attacked him in the act of helping him
self to a bottle of whisky. With the aid
of his trusted club he soon put him to
flight.
Shortly after 6 o'clock yesterday morn
ing- Hamilton was standing- In his store
when three younf? men, who were under
the influence of liquor, entered the bar
room. After calling for drinks one of
them deliberately thrust his fist through
the show window. Hamilton ordered
them to leave when one of the men struck
him in the face. Picking up a club the
proprietor brought It <Jown on his as
sailant's head, knocking him senseless.
His companions then attacked Hamilton,
but were driven off after a short engege
ment. As they started to run from the
barroom Hamilton followed them, and as
he was within a few feet of the men one
of them whipped out a revolver and,'
pointing it at the plucky proceryman's
breast, fired. The bullet tore through his
coat and grazed the skin near the shoul
der.
