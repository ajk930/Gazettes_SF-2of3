REIGN OF TERROR

were young men; many a winter's night
we sat about the big stove in the store
back in Oneonta. N. Y.. and talked of
our future plans and builded air castles. I
was at that time 18 years old and Collis
P. Huntington was some live years my se
nior. The wonderful business sagacity
possessed by him asserted Itself from the
start. He was a success as a business
man. He had a jovial disposition and
made friends with all the country folk
around Oneonta.
"He was a man of remarkable strength
physically as well as mentally. I have
often seen him pick up a barrel of salt
weighing 300 pounds and lift it into a
wason. Mr. Huntington was an excellent
buyer. Frequently 1 made trips with him
to "New York, and In striking a business
bargain he was at all times alert and
active and he left no stone unturned to
keep his goods selling. In 1848 Mr. Hunt
ington left New York and struck out for
California.
"He had a hard time getting there, but
when he finally landed he began the great
commercial and railroad career which
marks him as one of the greatest finan
ciers of the country. From that time on
cur business affairs kept us widely sepa
rated, but we have kept up a frequent
correspondence, and I have often seen Mr.
Huntington. My last letter from Mr.
Huntington came a short time ago in re
sponse to an Invitation I sent him to at
tend my golden wedding anniversary. It
waa a charming note expressing his con
gratulations for Mrs. Deltz and myself
and denoting his sorrow at being unable
to participate in the festivities person
ally." . *â¢;/
her husband should be given 173 a month
ns lone as \u> lived 'out of contempt that
1 have for him." as the lady worded it.
Relatives Provided For.
"There were three other persons men
tioned In the will. To her daughter she
directed that $125 a month be given as
long as that relative llvrd. There were
also two sisters, or a brother and sister,
provided for in the same wayâ with an
allowance as long as they lived. I will
not be positive as to the exact nature of
the re!ationsrn:> of those who were men
tioned, but my conviction la that there
were four names that I sawâ a husband,
daughter, two sister?, or a brother and
a sister. My reading was hurried and not
very careful.
"As far as I read I was impressed with
the bitterness which Mrs. Townaend
showed toward her kin In her will, for In
cne sentence she wrote. 'So relative of
mine la worthy of my fortune.' As iar aa
1 read I saw that Mrs. Townsend only
provided allowances for those mentioned,
but neither of them was to have any part
or share of the estate.
"What disposition Mrs. Townsend made
of the estate or who were named as thtÂ»
trustees and executors I did not learn,
for by the time I had read what I havo
mentioned Mrs. Townsend herself came
forward from a chair in the corner and
I laid the will down upon the desk. There
was nearly a page of writing that I did
not peruse and since the lady's death I
have often .Â¦wondered.whaVdlapoattion sho
made of her big estate, as the unread page
of the will must have shown. I have salt!
nothing about this will because I did not
wish to become mixed up in the case at
all."
A Will of Recent Date.
â¢'Did you notice the date at the head or
foot of the will?" was asked.
"I only observed that the year was
1900. As the paper was clean and showed
no evidence of having been handled and
as the Ink appeared to be new and bright
I inferred that Mrs. Townsend had made
the will only a short time beforeâ not over
a month or six weeks. No, I have no idea
what became of It, as I went on with my
work."
"Are you sure that the husband, daugh
ter and other relatives mentioned were cut
out of the estate in all except allowances
for life?"
"Why, certainly. Her words were too
bitter to even admit of their getting any
but small allowances^ â "no relative of mine
Is worthy of my fortune.' "
Monument and Peristyle in Memory of Volunteer
Soldiers to Cost $100,000 Provided ForâDaugh
ter of Dead Woman and Other Relatives
Given Small Annuities.
NO relative of mine is worthy of my fortune." These bit
ter words are embodied in an olograpbic will which R. A.
Tuttls of this city declares was written and signed by Al
mira S. Townsend within a few months of her sudden death.
The document also provided that $125 a month be paid to the
daughter, Mrs. Ella F. Murray, during her lifetime, and Â§75 a
month to her husband "out of contempt that I have for htm."
Ths sum of $100,000 was sst a3ide to erect a monument in
memory of the volunteer soldiers.
Mr. Tuttle is positive that the testament was drawn up and
signed by Mrs. Townsend.
IT Is now known beyond all doubt that
Mrs. Almlra S. Townsend, "the sol
diers' friend 1 ," who died under some
what mysterious circumstances at her
residence. 1221 California street, on
the night of July 22, made a will dispos
ing of her large property in the early
part of this year.
Whether It fell Into the hands of her
daughter. Mrs. Ella F. Murray, or still
remains in some secret nook, where It
was placed by Mrs. Townsend. Is not
known, but that it once existed is attest
ed by a reputable business man, R. A.
Tuttle, the real estate dealer at 630 Mar
ket street. The important document came
into Mr. Tuttles hands under peculiar
circumstances, and having seen It but
once, and then only for a few minutes,
he is naturally very reticent about dis
cussing Its contents.
Mr. Tuttle was formerly associated with
the real estate firm of Madison & Burke,
handling for them much of their impor
tant land business. Mrs. Townsend was
one of the firm's customers and a fre>
quent visitor to the office, where she De
came acquainted with all of the employes.
An Olo^raphic Will.
One day about the middle of last March
Mr. Tuttle was engaged on land matters
and stepped across the office to a desk for
some data. On the desk lay several docu
ments and among them was one on which
the writing "IIOO.OOO"' attracted his atten
tion. He picked it up and a glance show
ed him that it was an olorraphic will.
Turning * to the signature, he read the
name "Almira S. Townsend," the signa
ture being duly attested by witnesses, one
of whom Mr. Tuttle recollects waa named
Woods. In speaking of the will, Mr. Tut
tle said that the body of the document
was in the same handwriting as the tes
tatrix's signature, and no printed or type
written matter appeared upon the two
large pages of the document.
"I was particularly struck," said Mr.
Tuttle, "with her bequest with reference
to the erection of a monument to be placed
in Golden Gate Park in memory of the
soldiers of whom she was so fond and by
whom eo much beloved. She also directed
that the sum of $100,000 be set aside from
her estate for the erection of a white
marble 'perrystyle' In memory of the sol
diers who went to the Philippines and
never returned. I was considerably Im
pressed with the lady's way of spelling
peristyle, with a capital P, two r e and
two y's."
"In another part of the will," continued
Mr. Tuttle, "Mrs. Townsend provided that

YESTERDAY arrangements were
made by the employes of the South
ern Pacific Company to shnw their
respect for the memory of their
chief. The arrangements will, in
a great measure, depend on the time of
the funeral services in New York, but the
principal features have been decided upon.
There will be memorial services in ' the
First Presbyterian Church, at the corner
of Sacramento street and Van Ness ave
nue, at 11 o'clock. They will be conducted
by the Rev. Dr. Robert Mackenzie, pastor
of the church. There will be a short
memorial address by Dr. Mackenzie and
some singing by the choir, under the di
rection of the church organist. Otto Flelss
ner. The services will last about an hour.
All employes of the Southern Pacific of
fices will be given an 'opportunity to at
tend the services and those in the yards
will bo given all the chance possible. The
offices will be closed 'all day.. - The ser
vices will not be for the employes of the
Southern Pacific Company exclusively,
however, for it has. been announced' that
any one who knew Mr. ' Huntington and
wishes to attend will bo made welcome.
It has also been decided to send a mag
nificent floral piece to the church in New
York from which the funeral will be held.
This will bo ordered in New York by tele
gTaph, subject to the approval of Mrs.
Huntington, and will be sent as coming
from all the employes on this coast.
All Wheels Will Stop.
It has been further , arranged Â¦ that . for
the few minutes that will pass while tho
casket is being borne from the hearse to
its last resting place every wheel in the
Southern Pacific -system wlll.be stopped.
The shops will cease their bustle, cnginen
will pause upon the rails and ferries will
rest quietly upon the water while the body
of. him who i was once the head of all Is
borne to the grave. "The exact time will
bo sent out here, to-day, and all arrange
ments will be made with due regard to
the difference of the hours- here and in
New York. â¢
Yesterday the big yellow building on the
corner of Montgomery and Market streets
was draped In black. Over the doorway
the folds of black bunting fell heavily,
and over every window there was the
same sign of mourning. Every railroad
flag was at half mast, and along, the
street the railroad agencies showed the
same tribute to Huntington's memory.
At Oakland- and Sacramento, .Los An

Story of the Death.
The casket containing the . body was
taken from the car and removed to the
house.
In speaking of the death of Mr. Hunt
ington, Private Secretary Miles, who was
present at the time, said:
"His death was very sudden. It was
due to heart disease, or, to bo more tech
nical. Dr. Coley states that death was
due to cerebral apoplexy; Mr. Hunting
ton was attacked with a severe coughing
Just after retiring. His wife and he occu
pied the same apartment, and when the
coughing attack came on Mrs. Hunting
ton gave him a glass of stimulant, as slio
had always done before. This seemed to
relieve him for a moment. Then he said
to Mrs. Huntington: '1 am very, very 111.'
Those were the last words spoken by
him. and he sank Into unconsciousness a
moment later.
"We had JusÂ«t finished playing a game
of whist and were all in our apartments
preparing to retire. Mrs. Huntington
called one of the servants and the alarm
was quickly given. When 1 reached the
bedside of Mr. Huntington he apparently
knev.' no one.
"One of the sen-ants was then hurried
ly dispatched to the steamboat Oneonta;
lying at her dock on the lake near by, and
she was sent for Dr. R. B. Taylor, who
was a guest of former Governor Louns
bery at his camp across the lake. Dr.
Taylor waa an intimate friend of the
family.
Doctor Too Late.
"Dr. Taylor came with all speed, but
when he reached the sick man's bedside
life was extinct. It was not more than
twenty minutes at the very most after
the attack of coughing started that death
came. â¢ â¢ 'Â¦ ,,
"These coughing, attacks usually were
accompanied by a sligttt paralytic affec
tion of the throat and other respiratory
Â° r Mr nS Miles. sa.ld Mrs. . Huntington had
borne the strain of the trip to this city
remarkably well. . having regained _ her
composure to some extent since her hus
band's death. He also stated that the de
ceased was not affiliated with any
church in this city, and no decision had
vet been reached as to who would be
chosen as the officiating clergyman at the
funeral services.
Many messages of condolence were re
ceived to-day at the office in the Mills
building and also at the house. Among
thoÂ«=e who sent expressions of their per
sonal sorrow were Senator Thomas - C.
Platt Edward M. Searles, Booker T.
Washington and J. , Kruttschnitt.
There Is a Will.
It has been' learned that Huntington left
a will, which will be read after the funeral
services. , .
Charles H. Tweed, in response to an ln
cuiry said: "I cannot talk about the mat
ter olf the will until after the funeral, but
you will be safe In assuming that there Is
a will." â¢ ; - Â¦Â¦"' * â¢>'"-'
Mr ' Tweed would give no estimate of
the value of Mr. Huntington's estate,
which Is variously said to be worth from
$27,000,000 to $82,005,000.
Seven Hundred for a Poem.
It developed to-day that Mr. Hunting
ton was the person who, at the time of
the great vogue of Edwin tMarkham's
"Man With the Hoe," had offered $700 as
a prize for the best poem on the "Man
Without the Hoe." More than a thousand
poems on the subject were submitted and
first, second and third prizes . awarded.
Mr. Huntington believed In the dignity, of
labor and he thought -the philosophy of
Mr. Markham's poem was harmful. ,
Dispatches say there was general
mourning to-day at Newport News, Â¦ Va;.

Boland's Petition Blocked.
SACRAMENTO TO
SHOW RESPECT
The matter of the petition of Public Ad
ministrator P. J inland for' letters upon
that portion of the estate of Huntington
being within California, came before
Judge Coffey yesterday. The Public Ad
ministrator was represented by M. C. Has
sett, who announced tb the court that as
the case had not been regularly assigned
to Department 9 it could not properly be
taken up. He moved that the petition
go over .for a few days until it had been
regularly assigned, but Judge Coffey de
nied the motion, as he said if the case had
had not been -assigned to him he could
not pass upon anything relating to It.
Hassett then moved that it be stricken
from the calendar, but this, too. the court
denied, and then, of its own motion, the
court ordered that the pptition be taken
from the calendar list, where it had been
added.
Mr. Hassett explains the situation by
saying that when the petition was filed
he went to Judge Coffey and told him that
In the natural order of events it would go
to Department 9, and that thereupon
Judge Coffey ordered that it be placed
with-the other cases on his calendar. But
when . the Â¦ case came up and no â¢ assign
ment had been, made, that the petition
was taken from the calendar and it now
Is in the position of a case awaiting
assignment.

done toward electing a sue- *
cessor to Collis P. Enntingrton,- .
but The Call has learned from *
a source that leaves no room .
for doubt that the matter has '
been settled and there is noth- .
ing more to do than to call a *
meeting: of the directors. "
_ _ f HTT.E the preparations for the
III fureral of Collis P. Huntington
III are under way no one is willing
to speculate upon the possibilities
of succession, but there are j
those who know that the matter has been j
arranged for a long time and that the
6ucce6slon of his nephew to the presi
dency of the Southern Pacific was one of
the things that Collis P. Huntington
favored.
H. E. Huntington is the logical candi
date for the place In the opinion of ail
Â¦whose opinions are va.lua.ble and who will
express them at this time. By training*
and by Instinct he is best fitted Tor the
place and he has been training himself for
years in just such a manner as Â¦would
Lest prepare himself for the succession.
What he is In the railroad world is due
to himself, for it was not until he had
secured his place among tie great rail
road men of the country that Collis F.
Huntington took him Into favor. And
eince he has been with his uncle he ha*
been aJlowed full authority and his sue- j
cess has been of his own making.
Those who know Henry E. Huntington
best consider him a financier second only
to Collis P. Huntingdon. He has always
rÂ»<ren a financier, and he has always been
a successful* one.
H. Z. Huntin gton's Start.
Hls first work of any magnitude was
while he was superlntenuent of construc
tion of the Huntington lines then, eariy
in 1SS0, being run between New Orleans
and Louisville. He gave his especial at
tention to the Chesapeake, Ohio and
Southwestern Railway. His success with
those lines earned for him the supertu-
tendency of the Kentucky Central Rail
road, which he took charge of in 1&4
Â¦while It was being operated by the Chesa-
jteake and Ohio Company. It was In a
ba.d way at that time and It was decided
to put the road into the hands of a re
ceiver. Huntington was appointed receiv
er, a position he held for a year, when
the road was sold and he was made vice
president and general manager. Under
his management the road began to pay
dividends and In 1800 it was sold to the
Louisville and Nashville Company.
Then Huntington entered the service of
the Eliza bethtown. Lexington and Bis
Bandy and Ohio Company as general man
cgtr'and vice president, and he continued
Jn charge of these roads until he came to
Callfornia.
Ia all these ventures he was put in
charge of roads that were going to pieces
end In each case he bulk them up and
thÂ© properties began to pay. He had a
marvelous faculty of grasping a financial
situation- His Instinct never failed him
and in the twelve years that he served
for Eastern roads he made no blunder and
no false move. It was that record that
brought him to the notice of his astute
old uncle.
His appointment to the Southern Pa
cific Company was that of first assistant
to* the president and his duties were to
perform those of the president while Col-
Jis P Huntington was away; and Just
about that time Collls P. Huntington was
arranging to epend most of his time In
The nephew took hold of the Southern
Pacific Company with the same skill as
be had shown In the handling of the
Eastern properties and under his man
agement the Southern Pacific Company
has epread and acquired until it has
nearly doubled Its business and Its influ
ence.
Beaching After Business.
When H. E. Huntlngton took hold of
the company the business of Southern
California was controlled by the Santa
Fe system. The Eastern company carried
nearly 60 per cent of the passengers and
freight and it was reaching out for more
until H. E. Huntington entered the nag.
He built feeders and cross lines and
tapped Santa Fe territory until the tide
of travel started his way and it was not
lo^g before he had reversed the figures
and it was the Southern Pacific that was
retting the â¬0 per cent of the busines*
and the other 40 was left to the Santa Fe.
He was placed In charge of the Los
Angeles Street Railway Company three
years and a half ago when it was on the
verge of collapse. The plant was old:
the cars had become strangers to paint;
the roadbed was rough and rapidly going
to ruin and the management was loaded
oown with useless expenses and hign
calaried officials. He ordered a change
at once. Within rix months he had the
management down to a working basis.
Jle renovated the cars and the power
; plant. He practically rebuilt the road-
Led and wrlded all the rail Joints in the
most jnodem fashion. He renovated the
Â« Id road to Pasadena and built a new one
out toward Pomona. He put everything
on a strictly business basis and last year
there was a profit of $30,000 from the
J>os Angeles lines and $17,000 from the
J'asadona line.
As a negotiator of rights of' way he
has earned a refutation beyond \ his own
people. He baa been Scnown to send a
â¢nan out over a piece of country to secure
f; rices and then when the list was hand
ed to him to scale it down from 25 to 63
j>er cent on eax;h item and then make sat
isfactory deals with ilie owners on that
basis. Ho waa never deceived In tho j
value of & piece of land and when th6
right of way men faiied to make pur
chases from obstinate owners he would
go around himself and he was always
successful in making a satisfactory ar
rangement and always on his own terms.
"Was a Born Trader.
Like his uncle, he is a born trader. He
will trade everything he has, but he will
lose nothing by the transactions. He
made a land deal in Covington, Ky., that
netted him thousands, and when he
bought the land at first he did so against
the advice of old land speculators and
financiers. He has made connections and
concessions and secured privileges and
favors for his road that are due entirely
to his own executive ability, and since he
fairly started as one of the managers of
the Southern Pacific its progress has been
mainly due to his efforts. He has studied
the railroad situation on the coast under
the most favorable circumstances, and
has seen where the policy of force
has raised opposition easily avoided- by
more conciliator}- methods. With the em
ployes of the company he is popular and
with the needs of the company he is thor
oughly familiar, and his ability has placed
him In the line of succession as first vice
president.
He was born in Oneonta, X. T., in 1S50,
and is etlll in the prime of life and vigor,
and while nothing official has been said
about the succession. It has been decided
that under him the Immense interests
that Collis P. Huntington left eo suddenly
can best be carried on.
Tweed's Candidacy.
Immediately upon the death of Collis P.
Huntington the report was spread that
his successor would be Charles H. Tweed,
general counsel and second vice president
of the Southern Pacific Company, but in
a dispatch from Xew York he Is quoted
in a way that seems to indicate that he
believes H. E. Huntington will get the
place. He is quoted as saying: "Mr. H. E.
Huntington, nephew of Mr. C. P. Hunt
ington. Is the first vice president of the
company. I am the second vice president.
But all that Is a matter for future ar
rangement."
The choice of the president , will rest
with the directors, and as all who can are
hurrying East to attend the funeral or
are already in New York it will be some
time before they can be called together.
In the meantime speculation Is rife among
the employes. It was reported that
Thomas M. Hubbard, representing . the
Searles Interest In the company, would
oppose the election of H. E. Huntington
on the ground that the policy of the de
ceased president was Inclined to be rather
antagonistic than placating and that the
nephew would more than probably follow
In his uncle's footsteps. The policy of an
tagonism, however, has not been that of
H. E. Huntington, and his policy while in
control of other roads has been anything
but unpopular. In fact, his policy haa
always been his own, and it is not likely
that he will reflect any one but himself
In the management of any of his enter
prises.

ADAMS JURY COMPLETED
AND HIS TRIAL BEGINS
Opening Statement Made by Prosecu

fendant's Plea.
A Jury to try George G. Adams, for the
murder of E. S. Kepner, was secured In
Judge Lawlor's court yesterday and the
opening statements of counsel were made.
Assistant 'District Attorney Alford made
the opening statement on behalf -of the
people and was followed by ex-Judge
Ferral, who represents the defendant.
Mr. Alford laid special stress on the ac
tions of the defendant subsequent to the
commission of the homicide at 44 O'Far
rell street, the flight of the prisoner to
San Mateo County and his efforts to board
an outgoing train being pointed to as evi
dence that he knew that he had no valid
defense. The prosecution theorized that
the motive for the crime was evidently
the defendant's desire to revenge himself
on his employer, who had dismissed him
from his position, but only after numer
ous complaints had been lodged against
him by customers.
Judge Ferral, on behalf of the defend
ant, said that he would prove that his
client acted in self-defense.
SEATTLE, Aug. 15.â The criminal ele
ment Is again in the saddle at Nome, ac
cording to passengers who arrived from
the north by the Centennial to-day. For
a week or more prior to that vessel's de
parture thugs, thieves and firebugs had
kept the city In a state of suppressed ex
citement and talk of lynching was to be
heard on every street corner. The crimes
were apparently the work of an organized
gang, which carried on Its operations sys
tematically, regardless of the military.
The greatest indignation has been
aroused by the discovery and frustration
of at least three separate and distinct at
tempts to burn the city, and a rumor was
in circulation on the streets that a gang
of firebugs had planned to start fires in
various parts of the city simultaneously
and loot the banks, shops and stores dur
ing the progress of a general conflagra
tion. The local columns of the news
papers are full of accounts of the doings
of highway robbers, burglars, pickpockeu
and incendiaries.
The Centennial brought also news of the
wreck of several vessels on the Nome
beach on August 2 and 3. during which
time a severe storm raged. The steamer

STOCKTON, Aug. 15.â G. H. Adams and
Edward Peterson dug up four cans of
treasure to the west of Stockton at the
place known as the "Old Indian Burying
Grounds," north of Stockton Channel, this
morning. In the four cans $S00 In small
change had been burled In years gone
by. In one of the cans was $55, and this
was given to Peterson and Adams by the
man for whom they dug up the money.
In relating the circumstances to a re
porter this afternoon Adams said:
i "I don't know the name of the man who
buried the money, nor the name of the
man we due it up for. He 'came after us
and said he had a little job of digging
to do. "We didn't take much stock in
what he said at first, but he Insisted, and
so we went with him more out of curi
osity than anything else. He said he could
tell the place by an oak tree, the location
of which his partner had described to him.
Well, we went away down west of the
town to the place ) they call the
"Old Indian Burying Grounds," and
at a place where a fence runs
north and south, this side of the
woman's railroad grade, we saw the oak
tree 'which had been blazed, that is, the
bark had been cut away, though it must
have been done a long while ago, because
It was pretty nearly grown over.' While
he was pacing the distance between the
trees we went and got our shovels and
picks.
"When we came back he had located
the place and *was digging In the soil with
his hands.. He said. he was trying to find
the top of a stake. which marked the ex
act location of tho money. I got out my
knife and helped him and pretty soon the
blade struck something. We got the
stake out presently. It was a^small piece
of wcod and pretty rotten. The fellow
said that was the. place to dig, so we "fell
to work with our picks. After digging
about an hour we uncovered four cans In
a space about three feet square, working
by his direction. The cans were in cor

upward of $8000.
Mr.' Frank for a number of years has
had business relations with Lenz & Leiser
in his operations In the northern country,
and a short time ago was entrusted Vith
the collection of some heavy accounts at
Dawson and White Horse. At the former
city he collected about $5000 and started

The amount collected at the latter place
was forwarded to Lenz & Leiser from
Seattle, whither Frank proceeded instead
of coming to Victoria. v Â¦ - .,
The suspicions of the firm being aroused
by Frank's non-appearance, the police
were communicated with and a little In
vestigation on their part developed the
fact that Frank, on going to Seattle, took
an assumed name, so there seems no
doubt but that the man purposely de
camped with the money, though why he
should have forwarded on to Victoria the
sum he collected at White Horse Is diffi

Leaving Seattle Frank went to Portland.
The police discovered that much, but all
track of him from that point is lost.
. Going to Dawson at the outbreak of the
Klondike excitement Frank was one of
the first to engage in business there, and
for a time did very well. Latterly, how
ever, he met with reverses.- Suspicion in
regard to him was first aroused about a

he happened to look along the road again
and saw that the team was still there.
Surmising that there was something

was about fifty feet behind in the road.

more than lOOO, including the men em
ployed in tha big American smelter there,
which was luckily saved. The loss will
be between S125,<XJO and $130,000. Only a
few days ago the Columbia Townsite
Company purchased the townrite and
buildings, and the latter were then reck
oned to be worth haJf of the $3iXÂ»,wjO of the
purchase price.
The blaze started mysteriously at the
rear of the Escaldes Hotel, which was
worth $30,<Â«jO. The llames quickly spread
from tiie outhouses to the main building
and almost before the alarm was given
the b:g frame structure was ablaze to tho
roof. There was no fire-light ing equip
ment, but the bucket brigade was at work
without a moment's delav. The wind
had been blowing liercely all day, amid
iitful showers of rain, and nothing could
stop the bkize. The flames swept down
the corridors and through the halls of tho
hotel. Four children and two women
were in the third story and had to jump
for their lives. Mrs. Clayton, one of the
women, had rushed upstairs when tho
lire burst through the halls, but was un
able to return with her two childen. Al
thought ttae roof was ablaze. 'the east side
of the building was still entire, and
through the windows there the women
fixia children jumpod, one by one, to the
blankets h^la by the men below. AH
escaped unhurt.
From the hotel the Tire ppread to the
Model livery ttable next door, and from
there to a row of the principal stores and
warehouses. The wind was all the time
carrying the Fparks toward the resident
portion of ihe cast side of the town, and
soon the houses there were In flames. The
bucket? were still worked at a heart
breaking pace and four buildings were
dynamited to arrest ihe progress of the
fire, but it was all to no purpose, and by
2 oolook scarcely a building remained.
The latest message from Columbia, be
fore the wires were down, told that the
'J r * T GS Ft!11 ~ a Sing and Jhere was no hope
lot tho few buildings that remained Van
couver and Victoria will send hein to the
lire sufferers at once. " â¢

A year ago. and again about Fix months
aÂ«o. incendiary attempts were made to
burn down the hotel, and it mav have
been a repetition of this that caused the
disaster of to-day. A very bitter tight has
been groin g on for a year between the pro

The following Is the platform adopted:
Four years ago the Republicans of Washing
ton met to mourn over universal calamity and
despair under Democratic rule. To-day we
meet to rejoice over universal prosperity and
happiness under Republican rule. Democratic
theories became dangerous when coupled with
political power, and they are not improved by
a mongrel mixture of free silver and Fopulls
tic vagaries. They can be rendered harmless
only by maintaining Republican rule In na
tion. State and county, and to such mainte
nance We pledge our strongest effort.
"We are proud of President McKin
ley and indorse, his able, fearless and
patriotic administration.
We rejoice that he is again .our standard
bearer and will continue to be the honored chief
of a prosperous and happy people. He has
fully redeemed the ante-elpction Dlcdsos of his
party. Under his leadership protection and
reciprocity have again been restored to their
proper place In public law; the Hawaiian Isl
ands have become part of the Union; Spain has
been compelled to lift her heavy hand from oil
the Western hemisphere; Cuba has been made
free; Porto Rico Is happy under our rule: the
Philippines are rapidly learning to appreciate
and acoept that kind of liberty which is known
and understood only by the American people;
our army and navy have been ably sustained;
the honor of our flag has been maintained at
home and abroad; the Democratic cry of free
silver has been put to sleep by a Republican
Coneress and the gold standard has been re
affirmed In a Dositive and satisfactory man
nÂ»Â»r; our country"s credit has been made better
than ever before and better than that of any
other nation on earth.
We congratulate the country upon
tha nomination of Governor Roose
velt for Vice President. He has con
tributed much to the success and
glory of the first term of President
McKinley, and will add great
strength and honor to the next.
We Indorse the Republican national platform
adopted at Philadelphia and commend It to the
vc.ters of this State as an able exposition of
Reitfbllcan doctrine and of correct public
policy.
"We unreservedly Indorse and approve the
work of fcenator Addlson G. Foster and Con
gressmen W. L. Jones and F. "\V. Cushman.
We stand for loyalty to the flag,
for the gold standard of value for all
our money, for protection and re
ciprocity, for the Nicaraguan canal,
operated, owned and defended by
the United States; for ths
election of United # States Sena
tors by direct vote of the people;
for tho further enlargement of our trade and
commerce; for purh discrimination and national
aid as shall speedily result In the upbuilding
of our merchant marine and x.he ripld enforce
ment of the laws against trusts; for the loyal
and liberal support of the nation's defenders â
the army and navy; for the uncompromifingf
suppression of the rebellion on Luzon Island;
for the immediate rescue of our
people imperiled in China, and
for ample restitution for loss
of life and property therein;
for a territorial form of government of
Alaska, including protection to navigation, and
oppose relinquishing soil or sovereignty of any
part of that district; we favor the early con-
Ftrtfction of a submarine cable connecting this
State with our Island possessions In the Pacific
Ocean owned and operated by the Federal
Government.

Proper Way for Dating Letters This
No really chic woman .would now date
her notes In the old way, and nothing can
be more fashionable than to head a letter
the "XXIXth of January," for Instance.
More elegant still Is to do away with the
envelope and fold the thick vellum paper.
The crest or . seal must be In wax of a
color matching exactly the new delicate
shades of paper.
Stationers In Paris always sell the wax
and the paper together now, and recom
mend you to use a lamp, not a candle, so
as not to alter the color of the sealing
wax. Then you must write the address
quite at the top of the letter when folded,
and manage to leave as much white space
as possible at the bottom, where you put
the stamp. ; This Is to allow the postofnee
officials to stamp the letters without ob
literating the name of the person to whom
It Is written. â New Orleans Times-Demo

home. He seemed to enjoy the notoriety
that has suddenly come to him and ex
pressed no surprise at the capture of the
letter and Its publication. When a copy
of the letter -was shown to him he read it
carefully and then remarked:
"Yes, I wrote that, in addition to a lot
of other letters. Of course, I Eee a lot of
inaccuracies as a result of the two trans
lation? and some omissions which I think
are the fault of the War Department.
"There is one omission in the letter as
given out for I know I pointed out clearly
that Congress had never authorized the
war in the Philippines, and the President
having no right to make war was with all
those concerned in it a pirate. I have
seen many Filipinos and have entered into
correspondence with more. There are
some of these Filipinos now In this coun
try. Of course, I cannot give you their
names.
"McKlnley ought to be Impeached as a
traitor. He lied to the country by saying
the Filipinos began the war, for we have
the name of the American soldier who
fired the first shot, and then when Agui

the shooting to be kept right up.

The admiral said he remembered having

from Manila and recalled that he was one
cf the editors of the Singapore Press. "I

"thtt I never promised the Filipinos inde

eaw that the women folk were on the
lawn in front of the house, they climbed
down.
When they reached terra flrma and
looked about them they saw that Mrs.
Armitage had disappeared and a few sec
onds later Â¦were horrified to hear her call-
Ing out from one of the windows of the
second floor. She had re-entered the
house, presumably to save her mother's
jewels. Her husband and brother im
plored her to jump, as the flames were
very near her. She hesitated, evidently
bewildered, and the two men secured u
ladder and raised it. Both men ascended
to the window, but when they reached It
Mrs. Armitage had disappeared. They
smashed the window, when a great cloud
of smoke followed by flame belched forth
and drove them back despairingly.
At this moment the volunteer firemen
came dashing on the scene. Fireman
Cameron led the van. On being informed
that Mrs. Armitage was still in the blaz
ing house Cameron .mounted the ladder
and leaped through the window into the
tlame and smoke.
Dazed by this act of courage, the crowd
waited silently. In a few minutes Cam
eron's figure was seen in relief against
the background of flames, bearing in his
arms the unconscious and lire-scarred
The family is prostrated by the death of
Mrs. Armitage. She was a handsome
woman, 2* years of age. Her husband is
a railroad engineer. Her mother, Mrs.
Schultz, was in San Francisco at the iimn
of the fire. Mrs. Schultz has several
daughters, one of whom resides in Santa
Rosa, another In Geyscrville, and two in
Healdsburg. One of her sons resides in
the country in this county. AH the mem
bers of the family have been summoned to
Cloverdale. The funeral of Mrs. Armi
tage will te held Thursday.
All efforts to save the house, which wa's
a large structure and well furnished, were
futile and it was destroyed with its
contents, including several thous.anii dol
lars' worth of jewelry and about $1000 in
money, part specie and part paper. The
family lost all wearing apparel. The
total loss is about $10,000. The cause of
the fire is unknown.
Mrs. Armitage was carried to a neigh
bor's house and medical aid was sum
moned. Besides being nearly asphyxiated
by smoke, she had sustained severe
burns about the body, head, hands and
feet. She did not recover consciousness
and shortly after died. All the members
of the family in the house at the time
of the lire suffered more or less severe
burns.

of applause and sighs of relief. Other

DASHES INTO A SEA OF FLAME
TO SAVE A WOMAN'S LIFE
GRAND RAPIDS. Mich.. Aug. 15.â The
northbound Northland express, which left
this city at 4:05 a. m.. and southbound
passenger train No. 2, due here at 6 a. m.,
collided in a dense fog at an early hour
this morning at Pierson, twenty-nine
miles north of Grand Rapids. Seven per
sons were killed and nine severely In
jured, one of whom cannot recover. The
dead:
CHARLES M. LETTS, Grand Rapid3,
conductor of northbound train No. 6.
GILBERT GROETVKLDT. Grand Rap-
Ids, engineer of No". 5.
WILLIAM H. FISH. Grand Rapids,
engineer of No. 2.

saw, passenger, badly hurt about face
and chest.
When the trains met day was just
dawning and the fog was so thick that
the engineers could not see more than
a hundred yards ahead. According to the
railway officials the collision was the
fault of Operator Wells, stationed at Mill
Creek, four miles north of this city. The
trains\ usually meet at Sand Lake, two
miles north of Pierson. An order was
issued that they meet at Woodstock, four
miles north of Pierson. Later Operator
Wells Â¦ was asked if the express had
passed his station yet. He answered
"No." He was then told to countermand
former orders and give orders to No. 5
to meet No. 2 at Sand Lake. Similar or
ders were given to No. 2. Train No. 5
never got the order, having already
passed Mill Creek.
They collided. . therefore, while both
were going at full speed. The forward
cars were telescoped. The big mail and
dining cars on No. 5 saved the Pullmans
in the rear and the passengrer coaches on
No. 2 were saved by three freight cars
which happened to be attached next the
engine. There were eleven cars on train
No. 2 and ten on No. 6. Only six cars re
mained on the track and the engines wera
literally torn to pieces.
When Operator Mills had discovered
his error he tried to stop the express at
Pierson. but was half a minute too late.
The injured were brought to this city and
taken to various hospitals. The dead
were also brought here. -The railroad de
tectives caught thieves at work at the
scene of the disaster.

What has happened in South Carolina is apt to hap
pen in other Southern States. The suppression of the
negro vote, which has been done by Democratic poli
ticians to assure the success of their party, may have
the effect of leading decent white men in the South
to revolt against the boss domination that has con
trolled them so long. At any rate, the fight against
the pitchfork statesman will be watched with interest,
and the country will be ready to congratulate South
Carolina if he be beaten.
Among the antagonists of the State dispensaries are
the advocates of licensed saloons such as exist in
other States, and with them are joined Prohibitionists
who oppose the sale of liquor, even by the State.
This combination has given Tillnflin occasion to de
clare-recently that the opposition to him and his can
didate for Governor is made up of "an unholy alliance
cf the clergy and the rum interest." Such a charge
has aroused the church people, and now there appears
to be something of a religious fervor in the fight..
While the dispensary law is the issue of the cam
paign, it is said that in the minds of most of the lead
ers on either side the real animus of the strife is the
domination of Tillman. It is a contest between the
boss and the opponents of his policies, his practices
and his personality. In other words, the opponents
of Tillman have so managed affairs that he has been
compelled to stake his political future upon a fight
ever the State dispensaries, and accordingly there
have been arrayed against him many classes of people
who perhaps have never before voted together.
SENATOR TILLMAN of South Carolina has
in his own barnyard of South Carolina trouble
enough to keep him busy with his pitchfork
from now until after the election. By suppressing the
negro vote through a constitutional amendment he
left a way open for the white men of the State to come
forth against him, and they have come. They have
chosen his State dispensary system of handling the
liquor traffic as the point upon which to do battle with
him, and already the campaign is making noise
enough to be heard beyond the limits of the State.

LATEST STORIES
of the
FUNNY MAN.
It has been known for months past that the one
danger to the Kepublican party this year is that of z
feeling of over-cor.fiÂ«!ence among its members. The
slight registration in Republican districts in this city
shows that dar.gtr to be a real one. It is clear a good
many Republicans are so sure of the success of the
party that ther feel more or less indifferent as to their
own political duties. The showing of the registration
should have the effect of dissipating any feeling of that
kind. Republican! who have not yet registered should
do Â«o at once. The election is going to be an impor
tant one not only in" national but 'in State affairs.
Therf is needed a majority of honest and true Repub
lican? in the Legislature, and to effect that it is im
portant that in each Assembly district every Repub
lican voter should do his duty to the party and to the
country.
f he most sigr.ifir art feature of the tables, however,
is to be found not in the comparison of the registra
tion of this year with that of 1898. but of the registra
tion in the Democratic districts as compared with thai
in Republican districts. Nearly the whole of the in
creased registration is in the Democratic districts.
In fact, ir. two Republican districts there is a de
cieafe, and in nn<? only has there been an increase suf
ficiently large to be notable.
COMPARATIVE tables compiled by Registrar
Walsh fhowing the registration at his office up
to August 9 for the present year and for 189S
are deserving of careful study by Republican voter?.
There are eighteen Assembly districts in the city, nine
being normally Democratic and nine Republican. Tne
tables, giving the registration by district?, the Re
publieaxi being marked R and the Democratic D, are
as follows:

It will be seen there has been an increase of registra
tion this year at the main oftice over that of 1898 of
2Â»ro voters. That increase is smaller than was to have
been expected, for 1898 was an of! year in politics,
while this year the voters have all the incentives of a
Presidential election to urge them to act promptly in
getting their names on the register. It is true the
seeming apathy of the people may be explained by the
fact that while in 1878 registration at the main office
closed on August 9, it will not .close this year for a
month to come. Surh an explanation, however, im
plies that a considerable number of people prefer to
wait for a rush rather than to register early, when
they can do so with pmmptness instead of having to
stand in line and w2.it, and therefore, while it may be
a valid one. it is by no means creditable to the good
sense of the voters.

PERSONAL MENTION.
FASHION HINT FROM PARIS.
We have, of course, none but the kindliest feelings
toward Spain and our people are well pleased to learn
0/ her increasing prosperity. The exchange of tropi
cal colonies for American machinery and military
vainglory for honest and persevering industry will
certainly be beneficial to all her people and in the
course of a few years her historians may find as good
reason to be pleased with the loss of their American
possessions as British historians are now of the loss
to the British crown of those provinces in France
that bound England to the mainland and kept her
people in interminable wars.
Such is the unexpected way fn which cause and ef
fect operate in this complex world of ours. Spain,
crushed and humiliated, is going to work and is buy
ing American machinery to help her in the task, while
we are sending good money and a host of vigorous
young men away from the fields of industry to the
dreary and endless task of conquering tropic islands
and civilizing into our ways a race of people who have
already a civilization that is better fitted for them,
inasmuch as it is a natural development of their racial
characteristics. and their climatic conditions.
Spain Is undeniably progressing. The fine old Iberian
temper Is unbroken. No longer drained of her young
men to maintain a colonial empire, and free from tho
annual expense of $100,000,000 which it was costing to
retain the colonies, Spain Is prospering. The Government
asks for a loan of J200.000.000, and the Spanish people
subscribe S600.0o0.000. New factories are being built,
even electric cable works; electric traction is being
Introduced in the Spanish cities, and at Madrid, such
is the increased activity In business and travel, two
fine new hotels are to be built at once. Every improve
ment known to modern hotels will bo introduced. To
day Spain, once more thriving, is buying heavily of
machinery and sending large orders to the United
States.
OUT of our war with Spain we emerged with
the glory, the victory and the spoils. Every
immediate honor and advantage was in our
hands. It appears, however, that the genuine profits
of the conflict are with the Spanish. We are having
strife and expense as a consequence of taking posses
sion of the spoils, while the Spanish are enjoying for
the first time in years the benefits of a sound financial
condition.

Mexican Herald, says:

AT the close of last week the committee in charge
of the celebration of Admission day appealed
to the citizens of San Francisco to complete
by the end of this week the $50,000 fund expected
from the city as a contribution toward making the
festival the most magnificent in our annals. The end
of the week is now at hand, and it is therefore timely
to once more urge all citizens who can afford it to
make a liberal appropriation and make it promptly.
No argument can be required to convince intelligent
men of the importance of contributing to the fund at
once if they intend to contribute at all. The date of
the celebration is rapidly approaching. The prepara
tions for it are to be made on an extensive and elab
orate scale. Time is therefore an element of great
value in the enterprise, and the committee should
know at once what amount of money is to be avail
able for the work.
Admission day celebrations never fail to appeal to
the patriotic, instincts of Californians, but this time
the appeal comes with more potency than ever before.
We arc now to manifest to the Union what has been
accomplished within the comparatively short period
cf fifty years of statehood. The Native Sons of all
sections of the State have resolved to display what
has been done in their counties, and the details of the
celebration are therefore sure to be brilliant and at
tractive. There remains for San Francisco, as the
metropolis of the Stale and the scene of the celebra
tion, to. provide a fitting frame, as it were, for the
whole gorgeous and splendid festival. Every San
Franciscan in proportion to his means should make a
contribution to this fund, and, moreover, he should
make it at once.
ADMISSION DflY FUND.
It is a nice combination to ask the support of the
anti-expansionists The frozen truth is that with
Bryan for President under such influences the country
will get expansion, imperialism and free silver all in
one drastic, griping dose.
This, then; is the chief supporter of Colonel Bryan,
who has been elected president of the National Asso
ciation of Democratic Clubs, and is daily howling
r.bout the constitution following the flag, and joins
in Bryan's denunciation of an increase in the army and
navy!
He continued the same line of argument, called
anti-expansionists Toiies, Bluelighters and Copper
heads, and abused the President for supposed aver
sion to nailing the fUg to the Philippines.
August 13 he said: "We hold Manila and our flag
is hoisted there. No Blount in America will venture
"Well, we should keep the Philippines â because
we have annihilated Spain's power in that quarter of
the globe, and the responsibility of their peace and
order cannot be escaped, except by a loss of honor:
because it would pay; because the land is of immense
richness and needs only intelligent application of
modern methods to make it enormously productive;
because we need markets for our manufactures out
side our own land, which is now unable to furnish em
ployment to afl its people: because it will give us a
favorable position to contend for the trade of the
Orient; because the commerce of the Pacific is ready
for the greatest development in history. At the touch
of the American genius of production the Philippines
rt'ill return great profits to this country. A3 for the.
cost of an army and navy to protect them, it will be
no burden. Such troops as we maintain in the islands
* ill be paid out of the island revenues, on which they
will be a proper charge, and as for the navy, we are
going to have a' big one, anyhow. We shall draw
profits from the trade. As for the doubts of our abil
ity to rule colonies wisely and well, we are, in govern
ment, the heirs of the English, who have solved that
problem to perfection. We can do as well as they,
and if we cannot construct a system we can bor
row it."
August 1. 1898, he began to gird at the President,
saying: '"There are a great many people in this coun
try who would like to draw out of the Asiatic broil
altogether. The}- are the same people who opposed
going to war in the beginning, and they still oppose
acquisition of outside territory. It is evident that
the President desires to put away the responsibilities
which an occupation of the Philippines would entail,
and this although he must be aware that the prepon
derance of sentiment favors their retention. The Pa
cific Coast regrets that the President has resolved to
abandon the Philippines. We have made considerable
sacrifice in men and money to carry on the war. We
hoped that there miglu be some accruing benefit from
the acquisition of an important share of the trade of
these rich and fertile islands." August 7 he said:
'"Why should we keep the Philippines? ask 'the little
Americans/ who fear to look outside the continent.
Why should we spend money and support an army
and navy to insure the peace and industry of islands
7000 miles away? comes the cry from those who think
a nickel in the hand is better than a dollar gained in
venturesome trade. Why should we subject our poli
tics to the' added dangers of the corruption which has
overwhelmed Spain by adding colonies to our respon
sibilities? asks the timid publicist who is always fear
ing for the stability of our institutions.
One week later he snid: "If the administration sus
pect that the Philippines are a white elephant and do
not know what to do with them, the mercantile and
financial elements of the United States have no such
doubts."
Eight days later he said: "The matter of Aguinaldo
appears to be more serious. His acts are apparently
in direct denial of the rights of the United States in
the Philippines. Now it is not improbable that after
the Spanish are expelled it will be necessary to deal
withÂ«Aguinaldo and his fellow chiefs before peace can
be restored in the islands."
On July 15. 1808, he said: '"The new national pol
icy is in part accomplished. Hawaii has, been en
r.excd, and the fall of Santiago heralds the freedom of
Cuba. Rest not until all things have been done to
rr.akc the nation great. . Add ships to the navy.
Make WeÂ«t Point and Annapolis great universities for
the training of warriors."
Two days after that he said: ''There is no reason
why the inferior races should be admitted to citizen
ship, and Congress has the fullest power to make such
law as may be necessary for the government of the
islands, without being hampered by any of the restric
tions which the constitution places on the legislative
power in dealing with its own citizens.".
Hearst's case is one of peculiarly aggravated hy
pocrisy. His Ivysterical screeching for expansion is
too ffesh in the public mind to be dislodged by his
p:e.-ent abuse of the President and his party. On
June 27, 1S9S, Hearst, over his own signature, said in
his New York Journal: "Every officer and every pri
vste in the American forces on land and sea hopes
that no peace will be granted until the American flag
is nailed to the flagstalls of Porto Rico and the Philip
pines â not simply hoisted, but nailed."
He then published in poster type his celebrated
American policy, "Nail the flag to the Philippines."
So anxious was he to sec this nailing done that he
kowtowed to Great Britain, and on July 2. 1808, said:
"There can be no question that the American people
dceplyapprcciate the friendly attitude of England, or
that the expression of that feeling by prominent Brit
ish statesmen has been of distinct benefit to this
country."
Six days later he said: "For the present the Phil
ippines mi'st have an American government, and if
Aguinaldo docs not 'ike it he will have to reckon with
the officers of the American army and navy."
SOME surprise is expressed in the Bryan ranks
because the anti-expansionists show but little
disposition to accept him as their representa
tive and give to him their support.
There need be no surprise. It is known to them
! that the South, which expects to give him 120 elec
toral votes, is practically solid for holding the Philip
j pines and for unbounded external expansion. They
j know, also, that his chief newspaper support comes
! frcm the Louisville Courier-Journal and Hearst's
i three papers. Such being the sectional and journal
i istic fountain of renewed Bryanism, they are right in
! concluding that it wiil rise no higher than its source.
j find that a game of political hypocrisy is bting played
I to catch votes, elect Bryan and give him the power
to undo gold standard legislation and destroy the
! public credit.*
FOLlTICfIL HYPOCRISY.
ROCKEFELLER RICHER
FAR THAN MONARCHS
Â¦ 'w /EALTH has given John D. Rocke-
I -I f feller an income which any mon-
III arch might envy, for- he comes
very near to receiving more
money "in the course of a year
than all the crowned heads of Europe
combined.
That last princely dividend of the Stan
dard OH Company caused the world, of
finance to pause and think how much the
King of Petroleum really possessed. An
drew Carnegie, and that canny Scot has
an income of $20,000,000 a year himself,
says that John D. Rockefeller is the
wealthiest man in" the world. It Is con
servatively estimated that Rockefeller's
income is $30,000,000 a year.
It is a bold declaration to make when it
is said that Mr. Rockefeller is the rich
est man on earth, yet financiers say that
the figures will bear out the assertion.
He may be the richest man who ever
was, for there was Solomon, who, by con
trolling a considerable trade in Ophlr
gold, Lebanon cedar, granite, oils and
such things, as. well as by .levying tribute
and selling concessions, managed to get
together an annual income of 666 talents.
That is $17,502,450. Out of the savings
from the Kine and voluntary contribu-

to determine the income of the Kciperor
of Germany, for. besides the nearly $4,000.
000 on his civil list as King of Prussia, he
has a large Income from vast estates in
various parts of Germany.
FIGURES THAT DAZZLE.
John D. Rockefeller lives simply. His
table does not abound in luxurious food.
His abodes are plainly furnished. Yet ha
has more money than monarch? who arc
surrounded by gold-laced functionaries,
and are hurried abroad in carriages orna
mented with solid gold.
Th!s quiet man, at whose feet great uni
versities are called into being and schools
and colleges take on new life, has the
wealth of a Croesus, the touch of Midas
and the worldly wisdom of a Solomon.
Those who wish to get an Idea of tho
figures uj>on which the estimate of John
D. Rockefeller's wealth Is based need
first turn their thoughts to oil. Mr. Rocke
feller owns about one-third of the $100,000.
000 stock of the Standard Oil Company.
The stock pays dividends of 43 per cent
a year, which would give him an annual
income of $16,000,000.
Aside from that he has an enormous
Income from Iron Interests In the
Mesaba range. He has thÂ© control-
tions the temple was built. In the course
of seven years the Hebrew King was bankrupt. He maintained
out of his Income 40,000 stall* of horses and 12,000 horsemen.
FABULOUS WEALTH.
Then there was Midas, a half mythological personage, who
ruled Phrygia. Everything he touched turned to gold, includ
ing the viands which he planned to eat. He. too. suffered from
indigestion. Croesus, whose wealth has never been calculated,
felt piqued when Solon did not enthuse over his prosperity.
He had too much oil. The fluid was poured over a pile of fagots
on which he was compelled to sit. The kindly intervention of a
rainstorm watered it so thoroughly that the life of the Lydian
monarch was spared.
Queen Victoria is ordinarily supposed to be wealthy. Her in
come from her private estates is comparatively small, for she
gave away some of the most valuable of her property upon her
accession to the throne. Her annuity, which includes all the ex
penses of her household, is about two million dollars. The mem
bers of her family have separate annuities which are not in
cluded in the estimate.
The income of the Czar of Russia, which Is derived largely
from vast private domains, is estimated at $12,000,000. It Is hard
ling Interest In a fleet of steamers up
on the Great I,akcs. He has large and select blecks of stock
in gas and electric companies In the principal cities of the
Â¦United States. The Standard Oil Company helps him to con
trol gas and electricity In almost unlimited quantities.
OTHER SOURCES OF INCOME.
Mr. Rockefeller's â¢ interests In railroad properties are ex
tensive. He practically owns the Missouri. Kansas and Pacific
Railroad. The stock Is cheap, yet the bonds pay interest. It la
generally understood that Mr. Rockefeller has stock In thÂ©
Missouri Pacific, the Chicago Northwestern, the Chicago, Mil
waukee and St. Paul; the Delaware. Lackawanna and Western;
the New York Central, the New York. New Haven and Hart
ford; the Pennsylvania, the Union Pacific, the Baltimore and
Ohio, the Northern Pacific, the Chicago and Alton, the Chicago.
Burlington and Qulncy. and the National Transit Company. Ho
also has stock In the National City Bank, the Fanners' Loan
and Trust Company, the Amalgamated Copper Company, and
scores of other mining properties are on his list.
From a study of these properties It will be* seen that Mr.
Carnegie's estimate Is a conservative one.

Auditor Says the City Shall Not Pay
for Those in Police Officers'
Residences.
Auditor "vTells made the statement yes
terday that he will take steps to reduce
the number of telephones used In the va
rious branches of the city government. In
order to bring: the expenditures for the
purpose within the appropriation. The
Supervisors have only appropriated JTOOO
per year. for city telephones, and though
$12,500 was expended for them during the
previous fiscal year none have been taken
out as yet. A special committee appoint
ed by th-_> Board of Supervisors to inves
tigate the matter has made no report.
Demands for telephones in July were
presented to the Auditor for amounts
largely in excess of the one-twelfth por
tion of the total appropriation. They were
promptly returned to Superintendent
Glass of the Pacific Telephone Company
with the injunction to reduce them so
they would apsrregate but $(**).
In order to bring this month's bill with
in the monthly appropriation. Auditor
Wells will charge the telephones used by
the School Department to the school fund.
He will then direct hi? attention to the
telephones installed in the homes of the
otlirers in the Police Department. A num
ber of these are in tise>, and the Auditor
thinks they can be dispensed with. At
any rate. Wells will see to it that the tel
ephones for which $7 00 per month is
charged will be largely reduced. *o the
appropriation will not be exceeded.

when he sailed with the First California
Volunteers for Manila. To acquaintances
h<Â» said on the eve of his departure that
he would never return. He alluded to a
malady which had already necessitated
a surgical operation. Nevertheless he
lived to lead the volunteer California sol

close to the western margin of life. He
was in pain, but he grave no sign. Like 1

Colonel Duboce was a native of Spring
f.eld. 111. He came to this State about
twwrty-ftve years afro. He was a soldlei
from his young manhood. He enlisted as
I a private in Company A, Second Infan
try, N, G. C. October 8. 1S78. In the fol
lowing May he was corporal; sergeant the
next year; captain and aid de camp of the
Second Brigade, X. G. C. April 22. 1SSS;
major and quartermaster of the Second
Brigade February 7, 1590. Successively he
was paymaster and inspector with rank
of major of the fame brigade. On May 24.
1Â«93. he was retired at his own request.
The noxt month he was again made ma
jor and Inspector of the Second Brigade.
January 31, 1S96. he was elected lieuten
ant colonel of the First Infantry, X. G.
C. The talent for organizing was his.
Experience and close and intelligent at
tention to details gave him prominence as
a useful soldier.
Whon the war with Spain broke out and
the First California Volunteers were go-
Ing to Luzon, friends tried to dissuade
Colonel DnbrÂ»ce from taking active part
in the campaign. "How could 1 respect
myself If I failed to pro?" hp asked of one.
**I know that I have some service in me.
I True, there is no insurnnce company that
I would take me as a riskâ certainly I will
I not live to returnâ but I am going.-"
The remainder of Duboce's military ca
rwr is history. AVhen Colonel James F.
Smith was promoted to be a brigadier
pencral Duhore succeeded to the com
mand of the First California Volunteers.
When the regiment was reorerariizc-fl May
10, 1LO0. after its return from the Philip
pines, he was elected colonel.
Colonel Duboce's official discharge enu
merates the engagements in -which he
took p:\rt in thf Philippines. Tie was in
the Ntalate trenches from July 31 to Au
gust 1. 1898; took part In the a.^ault on
and capture of Manila August 13, 1S98;
was defending Manila ac-alnst the Fili
pinos until February 5. 1*K<: campaigned
against the Filipino insurrectionists from
February 5 to March 22, 1Â«99; went to Ne
gros Island Mar<:h 23 and remained there
until July 4, 1S99. These services are so
fresh in memorv. that the details need not
be repeated. Colonel Duboce commanded
at the taking of Manila a battalion that
wen distinction.
After the California volunteers returned
from the Philippines Colonel Duboce was'
mentioned In connection with political pre
ferment. He was elected a member of the
Board of Supervisors last November and
has since served in that body. He has
held no other public office.
Colonel Duboce was prominently Identi
fied with the Masonic fraternity. Ho was
a member cf California Lodge Nofl. F.
and A. M.. of Golden Gate Commandery.
K. T.. and of Islam Temple. Ancient Ara
bic Order of Shrlners, and also of the Na
tional Union. He was recorder of Islam
Temple for pome years.
Prior to eroing to Manila Colonel Duboce
was the city real estate agent of Easton.
Eldrldge & Co. He was formerly, for a
period of "years, connected with the whal
ing firm of Wright & Rowen. He also, at
one time, hnd charge of a station of the
United States Postal Service in this city
and was at various times in the employ
of different business concerns. Colonel
Duboce was in his forty-fourth year when
he died, having been born September 6,
IKS.

In the absence of Acting Mayor Tobin.
Supervisor P.ran<3ensteln took the chair
and announced that the board had met
out of respect to the memory of Colonel
! Duboce. Supervisor Sanderson paid:
"Colonel Duboce ne^ds no eulogy from
me. His patriotism and valor need no
i mention. His name will go down in his
tory as that of one of the first to answer
the rail of the President for volunteers;
one of the first to be mustered into the
Fervloe during the late war. and one of
th<* first to land on the soil where the
ptruggle was carried on."
Sanderson then presented the following
resolutions, which were adopted:

Deputy Quartermaster Gerreral Hum-
Lieutenant Colonel Deputy Quarter
master General C. F. Humphrey arrived
from Havana, Cuba, via Washington, T>.
C. yesterday, en route for China, for
which country he may sail to-day on the
"Warren. He thinks, however, that he
will probably await the departure of the
Sherman, owing to the crowded condition
of the former vessel; On his arrival at
the theater of war he will hasten to Join
General Chaffee wherever that officer may
be. This Is not General IIumphrey's t first
visit to the coast. From 1S72 until 1<vSS he
was chief quartermaster under Generals
McDowell, Schorteld and Howard at the
Presidio.
Questioned as to his mission last night
General Humphrey said:
"I do not know yet how I shall .proceed,
but my first duty will be to join my old
friend, General Chaffee, and receive my
orders from him. At Taku I shall meet
Captain Joseph C. Hyron. deputy quar
termaster, who up to the present time has
been managing that branch of the service
In China, I am afraid that this trouble
Is 'up for a run;' at least it appears so
from what we hear, but my experience
has taught me not to believe any reports
until I have actually seen for myself, so
1 don't like to express an opinion.
"I suppose supplies will have to be con

BIG STAKE TO BE RUN
OFF AT UNION PARK
F. Jones' Lavinian was In form yester
day for the midweek stake run down at
the Union Coursing Park. Step by step
she worked her way' to the deciding
course, winning all matches handily. In
the deciding course Lavinian agraln dem
onstrated her ability and took the stake
from Dairy Maid w^h a score of 11 to 5.
The stake waa noteworthy on account
of the numerous entries of Futurity can
didates. In many cases after "no goes"
or hard courses the solicitous owners
withdrew their dogs, fearing to tax their
strength so early in their training. x
The talent in yesterday's stake received
several severe shocks, the first being
when Crawford L^lss, an 8 to 1 favorite
over Lyddite, was beaten. Warrego won
from Roslnante, 1 to 3; Emma M from
Glen Roy, 1 to 2; Tony Bowers irom Cor
onado, 1 to 2; Toney Gold from Doris, 1
to 3; Royal Alameda from Tony Bowers,
1 to 2, and Tyrone Prince from Thorn
hill, 1 to 3^. Lavinian was on the short
end in the fourth round and won from
Round About after a hard course. Head
water, favorite of 2^ to 1 over Dairy
Maid, lost, to the great surprise of the
calculators. The scores are: / '

Newport; r. i., Aug. 15.â e. d. Black,
the expert English tennis player, to-day
beat Sumner Hardy In a hard five set
match. The Californian displayed the
best form he has shown during his play
ing in the East. Black played a 'back
court game, rarely coming to the net ex
cept to kill -the ball. His best stroke Is
a hard back-hand cross court shot half
cut half drive, and he Is very accurate
with-it. Hardy ran in to the net on
everything, volleying hard and deep. A
number of foot faults were called on him
and this disconcerted the Californianl
making him serve more, carefully with
less speed. Black won the first set, Hardy
getting two games. Black' had many
chances to play his back-hand and took
advantage. of It. The second set Hardy
took, allowing. Black but three games.
The Californian served and played . as
much .as possible to the Englishman's
forehand. Black won the third set by the
same score, but Hardy again tied the
score, making it two sets all by taking
the fourth set. 6-3. The fifth and deciding
set was won by the Englishman, 6-2,
though Hardy was. within a point of win
ning many of the games.
To-morrow Samuel Hardy plays Lamed,

English Tennis Player Proves Too
HABDY DEFEATED.
The Attorney General In his argument
made the point that while the accused
may not have intended to kill his victim
outright, still his. purpose in plying him
with bad liquor was to hasten his death,
after getting as much of the man's prop
erty as possible. This of itself. It was
argued, comes within the limits of the
statute relating to the crime of man
slaughter. From all that can be learned
this is the first case of the kind - ever
coming before this court or any court of
the United States. The decision will be
waited with interest. -
. The point arises In a peculiar case
argued by Attorney General Ford before
the Supreme Court yesterday, it being the
appeal of Simon Anderson, convicted of
manslaughter. Anderson kept a hotel In
Eureka, Humboldt County, of which
Thomas F. Kehoe was a patron. Kehoe
had money and he was a heavy drinker.
His physician warned him against the use
of intoxicating liquors on account of be
ing afflicted with Brlght's disease. The
testimony in the lower court showed that
Anderson plied his guest with liquor all of
the time In order to reduce him to such a
mental condition that he would transfer
his property. In fact he did Induce Kehoe
to present him with a check for $2000
which the bank refused to cash. Kehoe
died in due time, but not before he re
covered his reason â¢ and repudiated the
check.
AN a man be convicted of man
f slaughter because another man died
\from drinking whisky sold by him?
This novel point is to be decided by
the Supreme Court. The quality of
the whisky was not taken into consider
ation during the testimony In the lower
court, and the matter of rendering a de
cision will thus be easier for the Justices.
Anderson's Whisky
Caused Death of
T. F. Kehoe.
Officer Rice was tried and acquitted, it
being shown that Donnel\y was crazy
from drink and running amuck with his
weapon. Brooks, who is a bartender, was
convicted of manslaughter.
It seems that there was another man
who participated In the shooting. He also
is a bartender, named Ardell,. whose in
terest appeared to be his friendship for
Rice. That he fired a shot or two Is con
ceded, but he skipped out of the rountrv
before he could be arrested. Wht.t kind
of a weapon he used is not known. A
few days ,ago Ardell was arrested in
Plattsburg, Nebr., and Is now on his way
back to Fresno to face tlw charge. Ac
cording to the evidence presented before
the court yesterday It Is surmise. 1 ; that
the whole crowd will escape punishment.
Donnelly was on a spree and got into a
row with May Brooks, who called to Jack
Brook* for protection. Donnelly drove
Brooks away with a revolver. Special
Policeman Rice took a hand in the gun
play . and fired several shots. Brooks
went to his assistance with a pair of re
volvers and Donnelly was fatally wound
ed. A bullet from the officer's weapon
was found in the hip of the dead man,
but none from the weapons used by
Brooks'.
THE Jack Brooks manslaughter case
was argued yesterday before theÂ»Su
preme Court, Deputy Attorney Gen
eral A. A. Moore appearing for the
people. This is one of the most in
teresting homicide cases from the south
ern part of the State that has reached the
higher court for some time, the Interest
lying In the fact that it is known that
three persons took a hand in Bhootlng at
the deceased, Dan Donnelly, and there is
considerable doubt as to whose bullet did
the work. - "-

The board voted down a resolution es

Washington- Evening School. Superinten
dent Webster spoke in favor of the peti
tion of residents in the vicinity of Wash
ington and Mason streets. He said that
the high school class was necessary anil
moved that it be established. Casserly
was of the opinion that the board had
not sufficient funds to equip another high
school class. Superintendent Webster
stated that -the principal of the commer
cial class in the Washington Evening
bchool had expressed his intention to dis
continue the class unless it were provid
ed with more complete equipment. .
Three teachers who were consolidated
out were elected to positions in the de
partment-Miss Mary Brierton to- a class
In the Whittier Primary School, Miss M.
Lj. Folsom to the Hancock Grammar and
Miss Flora Van den Bergh to the Hearst
School.
.. A resolution was adopted providing that
tne High School principals, with the as
sistance of their faculties, shall conduct
examinations in December, 1900, for ad
mission to their January junior classes,
according to the regulations to be formu
lated at a later date by the board. Those
candidates who have finished the work of
the advanced eighth grade, whether from
public or private instructors, shall be ad
mitted by principals, awarding the usual
diplomas to successful pupils.
Owing to a typographical error In the

A delegation of German citizens, con
sisting of Dr. Max Magnus, Theodore
Pinther and William Plagemann, peti
tioned the Board of Education yesterday
to reinstate the three physical culture
teachers. Professors Barth, Stahl and
Miehlinp, who were recently dismissed
from their positions. The delegation was
representative of forty-three German
societies and 12,000 German-American citi
zens. The petition, which was read i>y
Superintendent Webster, referred to the
value of gymnastic exercises in the edu
cation of children and it was claimed that
the system "taught by the dismissed in
structors was superior to any other. Dr.
Magnus said that Professors Barth, Stahl
and Mlehling were competent and consci
entious in the discharge of their dutloa
and he made a personal appeal for their
reinstatement. He asked that a commit
tee from the board confer with another
committee from the societies on the sub
ject. Superintendent Webster supple
mented the remarks of Dr. Magnus and
called attention to the fact that he had
protested against the dismissal of the
physical instructors. He said he favored
the appointment of at least ten such In
structors, as he considered physical cul
ture paramount to all other branches of
education.

the New Vf- Dramatic Mirror on our
grand opera on at the Tivoli Opera

ance of this engagement Is even mom
clearly understood among New Yorkers
than It is with usâ in this "little town by

esting and exceptional phenomenon, that
a complete double cast of artists of curi
ously equal worth may be heard every
week during a long grand opera season
(at the price, too!) on this edge of the
world. A pleasant feature Is the genuine
musical appreciation of the situation,
which each performance only makes more
manifest.
It will interest admirers of the two
grand onera idols of the momentâ On'i
denzio Salas.*n and Signor Avedanoâ to
learn that their daily life during an op
eratic engagement Is almost monastic in
its simplicity. It is an Inflexible round nf
exercise, rest, study, rehearsal, perform
ance, and only in the rarest instances Is
this rule. Infringed upon. Doubtless to
this devotion to thoir art Is owing tho
admirable freshness and condition of thÂ«

Ryan, popularly known as "Jlm

pneumonia. A letter was received m the
city yesterday by "Dick" Farley, inform
ing him of the sad news. Deceased was
only 111 a few days and when stricken
down by the dread disease the best of
medical skill and of professional nursing
was obtained to relieve- the sufferer, but
to no avail. He was buried in "the city
of the frozen north" the day following
his death and his funeral was largely at
tended by the California colony.
Ryan was a great theatrical manager
in his time. He was the business man
ager of Edwin Booth, manager of the Cal
ifornia Theater in the palmy days for
"Tom" Magulre and also successfully
starred Alice Oates through Europe. He
was also associated with Robinson in his
circus ventures. A peculiar incident .in
connection withhis death is that hÂ» had
a presentiment that he would die In Nome
and -told his brother Peter so on bidding
him farewell just before he embarked on
the steamer in this city. '

MENRT SLATER, a private in the
Fifth Infantry, was arrested yes
terday morning after an exciting
chase and after he had made a
desperate but futile attempt to rob tha
house of John McFadden at 1914 Taylor
street.
About 2 o'clock yesterday morning Mary
Ellen, the thirteen-year-old daughter of
McFadden, was suddenly awakened to
find a man beside her with his great
coarse hand pressed heavily down upon
her mouth. The room was dark and the
child being unable to distinguish tho
features of the intruder naturally sup
posed the man must he her father.
"Is that you. papa?" said lifMn Mary
"Hush; don't say a word," said the in
truder, who was none other than the
soldier.
But the brave child continued to ask
questions until she awakened her little
twelve-year-old brother. John McFadden.
John stoutly ordered the soldier out of
the room, and while her little protector
exchanged words with the strange man
Mary rushed to her parents' room. It did
not take long for John McFadden Sr. to
rush afier the soldier that little John had
already put to flight. Big John and littlo
John and David M. Davies, a neighbor,
chased the soldier down Taylor street an.1
up Filbert to Jones, where with neatness
and dispatch he scaled two twelve-foot
fences and finally landed in the woodbox
in the back yard of the Brady residence,
2116"^ Jones street.
Out of the woodbox McFadden fished
the soldier, and binding him securely flung
him upon the ground. He then leisurely
sat upon him until Officer Brodt sauntered
by, fully two hours after the triumphant
capture.
When the officer arrived the soldier was
to all appearances unconscious. There
fore, Instead of hustling him to prison he.
was hurried to the Receiving Hospital.
An examination at that institution re
vealed the fact that the soldier was sham
ming and consequently the hospital offi
cials turned him over to the prison, where
the charges of burglary and threat to
take life were entered against him.
Little Mary McFadden was completely
prostrated yesterday, suffering from the
effects of her awful experience.
"The man's hand upon my mouth made
me feel as though I were choking, an-J
that is what awoke me," said the little
girl. "I asked him If he were papa or

talking up bravely to him and telling him
to 'get out of here' I slipped out to papa's

and went after him, too."
Little Johnnie was Inclined to treat his

"I Just ordered him out," said Johnnie,
"and when he didn't go I got up and

MIDWEEK NOTES
OF THE THEATERS
Something like a scandal has
In connection with the pound, ..and the
police are investigating the case. John
Shea, better known as "Gooney," a pound
deputy, Is involved < -
A brown mare belonging to the Arctic
Oil Works was grazing with other horses
in a vacant lot on Seventeenth street, op
posite the Lick School, and was missed on
July 10. The fence had been broken and
the conclusion was reached that the anl
rr.alhad been stolen, and the police were
notified.
Yesterday morning the horse was taken
to McDevitt Bros., horseshoers, 7 Haw
thorne place, to be shod. They .'do all the
work for the Arctic Oil Works and at
once, recognized the animal as the one
supposed to have been stolen on July 10.
They at once notified the manager at the
oil works, who in turn notified the police.
Policeman Conlon was sent to McDev
itts' place and George McEldowney, a
stableman at the oil works having identi
fied the mare, Conlon, acting under in
structions from Captain Spillane, turned
the animal over to McEldowney. It had
been sent to be shod by Shea, the police
man found.
Captain Spillane sent for Shea and asked
for an explanation. He said the mare
had been found wandering around on July
10 and taken to the pound. As no one
claimed the animal it was sold at the
pound and purchased by Maloney, the
driver of the dead-horse wagon. Shea
bought it from Maloney for the price he
paid, as his brother wanted a horse to
draw his potato wagon. He had no bill
of sale from Maloney.
The police are not satisfied with Shea s
explanation, and Sergeant Lewis of the
Totrero has been detailed to make a thor
ough investigation. He is to find out if
the horse was advertised for before it was
sold and who acted as auctioneer. It is
stated that the mare would not stray
away from the other horses of its own
accord, and Lewis will endeavor to dis
cover who broke the fence and other par
ticulars that require elucidation.
raptured by the victorious Germans in
3S7O had It not been transferred to the
Louvre, its present home. In spite of the
richness of the materials in this piece of
furniture, its careful decoration on front
and back and the two years' time taken
for its construction, it is difficult to real
ize that the present valuation of the
Bureau du Rol is about $100,000.
In our forefathers' day the "festive
board" was rather a rude reality than a
poetic license, for during the middle ag*>s
the table was literally a board or boards,
rough-hewn at that, placed across trestles
In the baronial hall which served as a
dining room, parlor and bedroom com
bined in one. In Saxon castles a special
table covered Â¦with scarlet cloth waa.
placed across the dais or raised portion of
the hall for the thane, his family and dis
tinguished guests; from the middle of this
table ran at right angles the longer and
lower board, uncovered, unroofed and
scantily furnished, at which retainers and
domestics made merry. In those days the
tables and not the seats were the movable
furnishings; for the seats were long
chests or heavy benches against the
walls, before which trestles and boards
were easily arranged. After the banquet
(a word derived from "bane," or bench)
was finished the impromptu tables were
easily removed, the minstrels and glee
men were bidden to the front and the din
ing-room was forthwith transformed into
nn entertainment hall for the lord of the
manor and his entire household. In Vene
tia. too, this custom must have been in
vogueâ so Shakespeare thoughtâ for In
"Romeo and Juliet," which he wrote
about 1396, he says:
Come, musicians, play'.
A hall! a ha!l! give room and foot It. irirts.
More light, ye knaves, and turn the tables up.
In time the trestles (from "threstule," a
three-footed support) were ornamented
with carved work and the boards hinged
in the middle for more convenient remov
al. For a long while it was customary
for the diners to sit only on the wall side
of the table, which was but thirty inches
in width, so that they might be more eas
ily served across the narrow boards, and
also that they might be on the alert in
case of attack or sudden raid. Possibly
this custom may have been a survival of
the old Roman fashion of reclining on
but one side, of the banqueting table.
While this Grecian and Roman practice
undoubtedly facilitated the, table service,
it is quite unlikely that the early Saxon
customs were in any way connected with
the sumptuous furnishings of antiquity.
On the contrary, after the fall of Rome
our forefathers seemed to share the prim
itive customs which marked the childhood
of the race, and to have groped their way
step by step, through the many centuries,
back to the convenience and elegance of
furnishing which had been indispensable
to the earlier civilizations. \
During the Elizabethan period trestles
and board were joined together in one
solid piece of furniture, and .the "stand
ing table" became the order of v the day.
Naturally there arose the problem of ac
commodating a varying number of guests,
and the solution was reached by placing
several "joyned" table's together. These
"sets of tables" when apart served as
pier tables, or side tables, the two end
ones baing semi-circular in shape. Then
the "drawinge table" was contrived, art
arrangement for drawing out two flaps
from either end. This In time was super
seded by the "folding table," which was
made, oftentimes, with as many as twenty
legs, and, as its name implies, could be
folded into about one-third of Its greatest
length. It was not until the year 1800 that
our modern extension table was Invented,
"to reduce the number of legs, pillars and
claws and to facilitate and render easy
their enlargement and reduction." Dur
ing the eighteenth century mahogany ta
bles of the design known as the "pillar
end claw" tables became very popular.
The round or square tops rested upon up
right cylinders, supported upon a plinth
having* three or four carved claw feet.
Variations of this pattern having, massive
legs and carvings of lion's head and claws
were so much admired for their rich col
oring and spirited carving that they were
fitted with extensions early in the cen
tury and made intÂ» horseshoe tables for
public meetings. "Within the last lCu
years there has been no modification, ex
cept in carving, of the dining table. Fur
niture designers, seeming to think that
human ingenuity could no farther go,
have turned their attention to the Inven
tion and reproduction after classic mod
els of the occasional tableâ that bane and
blessing of modern furnishing.
As a purely decorative feature the table
should have no place: If its usefulness,
may be enhanced by rare and enduring
ornamentation, that Is another matter.
This was a standard principle of furnish
ing among the early Greeks, whose dis
like of redundancy was one of the base*
of their excellent' taste. After the use
fulness of an article was once established,
then it was enriched with precious metaU
and inlay of ivory or fancy woods. Some
times this double purpose was achieved
by richness of design, as In the quaintly
elegant folding tables of bronze, with
legs in the shape of lions or leopards:
sphinxes, too. seemed especially adapted
for the construction of the antique table.
The smaller tables were either tripods
for holding braziers or were made with

Doited States District Judge de Haven
put down his foot upon a. cunningly eon
irived attempt to lund a. very prepossess
ir.g Chinese girl of 19 years as a native
born. Her name was given as Wai Ho
and the Chinese witnesses testified that
t-he was born on the first day of the sixth
x.onth of the sixth year of/ the reign of
Emperor Kwang Hsu, her place of birth
being 715 Sacramento street, in this city.
They also swore unanimously that on the
lirtecnth day of the seventh month in
he seventh year of the reign of Kwang
Hsu ehe went with her father and mother
to China tmd returned to this city last
A novelty in the case was the fact that
Wai Ho is a "bound foot" or "small foot"
woman, and these, ajccordlng 1 to Chinese
custom, are never allowed to lead im
moral lives, but are destined to become
wives of merchants.
The story went on that Wai Ho re
turned to San Francisco for the purpose
of marrying a Chinaman hero, but he
died, and she being in jail at the time It
va-s arranged that she should marry Jew
Mow Hong of Ham Kee & Co., 7^3 Sacra
mento street.
Jew Mow Hong did r.ot appear as a wit
r.rss yesterday. The last witness on the
Ftand was asked by Assistant United
States Attorney Banning- why he remem
bered the exact month of the girl's birth.
end he replied that three months ago he
was looking over an account book of his
firm and found an entry of a present he
had tr-adu the gbi'H fathrr and mother on
i):e day of the- child'? birth. But unfor
tunately the book was lost and could not
be produced in court.
JudRe de Haven announced that he did
rot l>e!ieve the witnesses. In cases of
thlM kind, he paid, the law required the
applicant to fcrnish proof to convince the
court not only beyond a reasonable doubt
trai to satisfy the court clearly that the
applicant was entitled to land. He was
not eailpfied that the girl was a. native
born American. She came hither from
China, and It was incumbent upon her to
I-rove her identity in this country. This
she had failed to do, and an order of de
portation was marie accordingly.
L^Lst April, while the Chinese bureau
officials were examining into the case, Dr.
J. E. Gardiner, Chinese inspector and In
terpreter lor the bureau, went to Sam
Kee's store for the purpose of examining
the partnership records in order to deter
mine whether Jt j w Mow Hong was a
partner, as he had represented, A book
Â¦was shown hira. opened at a. particular
f...^e. and. suspecting it to be a "dummy,"

THE BURGLAR AND THOSE WHO LANDED HIM BEHIND THE BARS.
BY MARGARET AIX3I.EE
(Concluded.)
The. bureau, in its modern acceptation
of the term, did not come Into general use
until the latter, part of the eighteenth
century, the convenience of the carved
utilitarian chests and presses having
hitherto supplied the general need. The
word -originally meant a writing dtsk or
escritoire, and was so called from the
"bure" or -baize with which it was cov
ered. These "scrutoirs" were generally
used as receptacles -or papers, deeds and
accounts, and were in the days before the
establishment of banks frequently made
with secret drawers.
An elaboration of this Idea Â¦was th? far
famed Bureau clu Rol made for Louis XV
in 1769 by Riesener. Aside from the beauty
of its marquetry, the magnificence of Its
mountings and the perfection of its grace
and symmetry-, this masterpiece of Riese
ner's has considerable historic interest.
Having survived the iconoclasm of the
French revolution, this famous chef
d'oeuvre was during the rule of ; Xapoleon
I In the Tuileries,. whence it ' was
moved to St. Cloud by Napoleon III:
there It would have undoubtedly been

quently fashioned of bardwoods, beauti

When Rome was mistrttt of the world
the furniture of the imperial city was of
the costliest description. Tables wpie rot
only made of gold, silver, bronze ar.tl
marble, enriched with damascening, en
graving, veneering and precioua srnr,,-\
but they were made of rare woods, which
brought fabulous prices'. The tab!<* i>f
Cicero, for Instance, was said tiÂ» hnvu

made of thym? wood, a rpfinoua wood
from the Atlas Mour.tair.3. It is m.u

pods, and forms the tloor and ceiline: â¢>?
the celebrated Mosque of Cordova. Wivn
we reflect that snmc tables of thi3 pre

than did CMeern"* we >!o not wonder that
when the Roman ladles were reproached
for their extravagance in pearls they rf
tort^d by calling attention to the siipor
stlrious rngr* for tnhlos of thyme wood.
During the renaissance in Italy verr

the center tables ot Venetian carvins

"This is an ideal food and evidently

One advantage about Grape-Nuts
Food is that it is predigested in tlie pro-
cess of manufacture: that is. the starch
contained in the wheat and barley is
transformed into grape sugar in exactly
the same method as this process is car-
ried out in the human body, that is. bv
the use of moisture and long exposure
to moderate warmth, which grows the
diastase in the grains and makes the re-
markable change from starch to crape
sugar. Therefore, the most delicate
fiomach can handle Grape-Nuts and the
food is quickly absorbed into the blood
and tissue, certain parts of it poine di-
r*jtly to building and nourishing tlie !
yi.in and nerve centers.

NEW YORK. Auk- 15.â To-day's stock mar
kft was in many rf-spects a counterpart of the
early trading of the woÂ»k. There was, however.
more ur.lfarTr.ity to the advancing tendency,
exemptions being limited to only a few stocks.
A distinctive broadening to the dealings
aroused optimism ia some quarters as to pos
sible early participation In the markPt by live
public. Some of the commission houses re
ported Increased orders ar.d stress was laid
up-jn the prorr.inence of the divl^pnu-payins
railroads In the rise. As an offset the bears
uwli on the depletion of New York l>ank rt
terv*^. consequent upon the r.M exports, and
the usual contraction In general business In a
Presidential election season. While the bank*
on Saturday will have to reflect upward of
tU.W.00 shipped, it :e expected that the loss
In the Furpius of the banks will be lancrely
offset ty the receipts of gold from Pacific
Ccart points, interior currency movement and
tains irom the sub-treasury. The latter in
stitution will have to disburse to the banks
later i:i the week some !2u.O0Q,OCO through the
redemption of the eld Government 2s. Money
iatÂ«-i> here to-day continued easy, but an easier
tendency was noted in discounts In London,
which caused long sterling bills to harden here
an.i the p,.isied figures were marked up VÂ«c.
It was stated that further pold phipments at
a profit are impossible at current rates foi
demand bills. The FtOCk market In detail
Â¦'.lowed conspicuous strength In many quarters
with the tendency for special stocks influenced
by rum-irs. New Jersey Jumped over 5 points
en reports of a change of ownership of the
jjroperty and favorable developments In the
anthracite coal trcd*. Other coal stocks sym
pathized, but the late reaction reduced their
pains to fractions outside of L>elawcre and
liudson. which closed 2-Â» higher. Itailroaj
stocks, particularly the pTangert. received good
support, but they Fufferej in common with ths
general list in the selling movement toward
the close. ProSt-UJdBS was indulged ; In in
the late dealings snd the market gave way a:l
tround, ending under pressure.
II ore busini-i-B w.is transacted In railroad
bonds to-day than for some time and there
was* a decided upward tendency for some

Anxiety of corn ihorts made that market an
active one from the start. Small stocks and
a large shortage for next month's delivery
with farmers reserves at a low ebb were caused
by a general desire on the part of the Sep
tember shorts to cover. Cables, weather, etc
cut but little Ice. September opened at 37%4J
3Sc, and amid considerable excitement ad
vanced to 39U C . The bulge brought out con-
Elderable long stuff and as the fears of shorts
gradually subsided September dropped back to
38^c, at which the market closed, compared
with the previous close at 37"Â»c.
Oats clung to the skirts of the corn market
and In a quiet way managed to advance slight
ly. September closed U@7sc up, at 22c.
Provisions were quiet, flnn for lard but eaÂ«y
fcr pork and ribs. Covering by shippers
against cash sales of lard gave that product
comparative strength. Liverpool quoted an
other 6d rise in bacon. September pork closed
5c lower, lard a shade up and ribs 7Vj@l0c

CHICAGO, Aug. 15.â Wheat was Quiet and
rather weak. The pit at times was half de
serted, the traders giving their attention to
corn. Liverpool was steady but nothing more.
Receipts were heavy and the weather in the
Northwest still dry and cool. The advices
from the Southwest pointed to the probable
early loosening of the movement quite inde
pendent- of Secretary Wilson's prediction of
dollar wheat In causing farmers to hold on
for a rise. September opened at 74 7 ic to 74Â»i@

NEW YORK, Aug. 15.â The market for cotton
futures opened barely steady, with prices 106
points lower and ruled generally weak during
the afternoon, owing to bear aggression, and
absence of anything like bull defense. The
close was steady, with August one point, other
months D@8 points higher.
New York Cotton Market,
To all outward appearances the market is con
siderably quieter than it was a week ago. It
is intimated In certain quarters that there has
been more actual 'buying during the last week
than appeared on the surface, a number of per
sons being engaged in picking up wool in the
quietest manner possible. According to most
accounts, however the situation could not be
much duller than it has been. The manufac
turers have apparently been much In evidence.
The mills appear to be governing their pur
chases of wool entirely in accordance with their
present actual needs. Prices are steady.
Sales of the week in Boston amounted to
2.212.S0O pounds domestic and 25.000 pounds for
eign, a total of 2,237,800, against a total of
3.348,600 rounds for the previous week and a
total of D.366.000 pounds for the corresponding
week last year. The sales since January 1
amount to 83,137,500 pounds, against 175.S73.000
pounds for the corresponding time last year.

the information since prepared by the Dis

Contest.
NEW YORK, Aug. 15. -There will be no
fight between the winner of the Sharkey-
Fltzsimrnons match and James J. Jeffries,

decided to declare this match off, as he
does not think there would any credit In
defeating a man who had another hard

OAKLAND. Aug. 15.â Because of the
worn-out condition of the flood gates at
the Twelfth-street dam, there has been
much delay in emptying Lake Merritt of
water, as had been ordered by the City
Council. Street Superintendent Ott also
says it will be doubtful if the water can
be iowered three feet and a half as di
rected, because the Flulces are only three
feet below ordinary high tide mark. The
leaky condition of the gates will militate
against the work because they will not
resist the inflow of each floodtide.
Superintendent Ott is striving to find a
way out of his difficulty and says he be
lieves he will soon be able to drain the
lake to the required depth of three and a
half feet. The purpose of the drainage Is
to determine what portions of the lake
were not dredged to four feet of depth
at ordinary high tide. ; t Â¦;.. ;â¢

5OME men become famous for the
silvery tones of their mellifluous
voices. Others gather the fruits of
renown for stalwart, muscular
achievement. Rarely are both found In
the same man. But there is a singer and
an athlete in this city at the present time
who is equally renowned for his prefec
tion of voice and the wonderful develop
ment of his muscles. He is no other than
Domenico Russo. the tenor of the Tivoli
Grand Opera Company.
Although R.isso is a small man In stat
ure he possesses muscles which in their
superb development make him the pride
of the operatic stage. He is both a fencer
and a*boxerâ in fact, an all-around ath
lete, who can accommodate himself to all
manner of acrobatic exercises. With the
foils Russo Is reputed to be an adept of
great ability. His burning ambition is
to meet Profrreor Tronchet of the Olym
pic Club and try conclusions with him in
friendly bout. The extraordinary df-vel
opment of Russo's forearm Is the result
of work with the foil.
Recently, in a rehearsal of "Carmen"
at the Tivoli. Russo, who was p'aying th>
role of Don Jose, astonished everybody by
his wonderful strength. Tn the heavy
scenes with Carmen thla Don Jose, a 5
foot 4 inch man. astonished his co-actora
by literally throwing the by no means
sfight Carmer. from one end of the stage
to the other.
Russo. before he arrived In San Fran
cisco, was in Portland, where he put out
two noted local lightweights with great
ease. He is looking for air 1 kinds* of ad
venture in this city.

There were even rumors of incidents in
the lives of some of the professors thnt
might have been a violation of the "mile
limit" statute.
But thtre came a time â slightly less than
a y*ar ago â when prohibition was spread
over the entire town of Berkeley. It then
became necessary to Jind ways and means
of catering to other portions of the town
than that around the university. So the
saloon on wheels plan was evolved, and
now an enterprising gentleman is making
his daily rounds through the town with
a covered wagon in which he carries a
=tock of all kinds of liquors for retail or
family 'wholesale.
So thriving has his business become that
the enterprising individual announces his
intention of investing his profits In an
automobile Faloon, and he will travel the
Berkeley cocktail route instead of forc
ing: the Borlcelpyite to come to him. He
niakes his rounds with unfailing regular
ity, and when Marshal Lloyd or one of his
deputies appears upon the scene he closes
the little doors and the vehicle is trans
formed from a saloon on wheels to an or
dinary covered delivery wagon. The
owner will sell one drink or a round of
drinks, or a quart of liquor, and he car
ries a very complete stock.

ALAMEDA. Aug. 15.â Another knot was
tied in the nuptial j string of Miss Ger
trude S. Putzman and Walter S. Malloy
Jr. when the young couple were married
to-night after the orthodox method, this
time with the approval of the mother.
Three months ago they were married by
contract,, because Miss Putxman's moth
er's consent could not be gained. Not
because there was any objection to the
young man did Mrs. Puitzman stamp her
disapproval, but rather for the reason
that she thought her daughter lacked
years and experience for the duties of
wifehood.
The story of the contract marriage
came out the other day after Mr. Malloy
Jr. had renewed a request to Mrs. Putz
man for her daughter's hand. When it
was again refused he blurted out that
they were already married, and by con
tract. Mrs, Putzman Insisted on the re
cording of the contract, and that Is how
the little romance was given to the world.
The wedding was celebrated at the
home of the bride's mother, 1121 Chestnut
street, there being present only a few
relatives and friends. The Putz
man home was handsomely decorated.
Rev. T. J. Lacey of Christ Episcopal
Church performed the marriage cere
mony. There were no attendants. Mr.
and Mrs. Malloy Jr. will make their home
for a short time in San Francisco, where
the groom is engaged in newspaper work.

AN EXTRA KNOT
TIED IN THEIR
NUPTIAL STRING
ALAMEDA. Aug. 15.â Awakened to see
her husband's form standing over her,
with a poised dagger aimed at her heart,
was the startling experience this morn
ing of Mrs. John Anderson, brlde s of a
month. Before murder was done, the
frightened woman leaped from her bed
and ran out of the house, pursued by the
bloodthirsty husband. Mrs. Anderson
sought refuge with neighbors. The weap
on wielder, fearing arrest, slunk away
and disappeared.
The scene of this extraordinary occur
rence was at the Anderson cottage, 1529
Ninth street, where the couple have re
sided since the marriage thirty days ago.
The young wife secured her belongings
this mornine and went to the home of
her mother on Park street. It was a case
of mother-in-law, according to the wife's
story, that aroused Anderson to his mur
derous threats.
The young woman was awakened to see
the glittering dagger and to hear her hus
band's threatâ "I told you to keep away
from your mother or I would cut out
your heart."
.Mrs. Anderson did not wait to give her
husband an opportunity to make good his
words, but fled without stopping for even
the scantiest attire. .
"When my daughter arrived home to
day," said the mother, "she dropped from
exhaustion and nervous shock. After
what occurred last night she cannot
longer live with her husband. That is
something we cannot tolerate."
Anderson was not to be found to-day.
It is supposed he fled, believing his wife
would call for police interference. But
she has no such intention. She had all
the household effects removed to her
mother's home and there she proposes to
stay. Neither Mrs. Anderson nor her
mother can explain, they say, the reason
for the husband's objections. Mrs. An
derson asserts that her mother has been
an ideal mother-in-law and has given An
derson no cause for ill feeling.
The Andersons have had a most un
fortunate honeymoon. Hardly had the
wedding chimes ceased to clang before the
groom landed in jail on a charge of theft,
'but after an interruption In his wedded
bliss of a week Anderson established his
innocence and gained his liberty..

Trouble Takes Sensational , Turn in
Oakland, Sixty Men Walking
Out From Job Declared
' â¢ Unfair.
-OAKLAND,' Aug 15.â The executive
committee of, the Building* Trades Council
to-day took a direct hand in the mlllmen's
battle for an-eight-hour day by ordering
out all mechanics employed upon the new
De Fremery building, ln course of . con
struction on Washington street, . near
Thirteenth.. 1 . Sixty men walked out this
evening when the whistles blew. Unless
the strike shall be settled before morning
the contractors will be without workmen.

CARPENTERS ARE
ORDERED OUT BY
TRADES COUNCIL
c- |f ~i'WO contractors took sides with the
millmen yesterday and refused to ac-
II cept material from so-called "unfair
shops." The operatives also report
three additional eight-hour mills In opera
tion, though two of them, however, did
not sign the original mlllowners' agree
ment to hold to the nine-hour schedule.
Iluwe & Ilippley. builders at 444 Fell
street, are erecting a house at the corner
of Twenty-second and Howard streets.
Yesterday morning some lumber sized at
Crocker's mill was carted to the new
house and the driver was about to unload
the stuff, when Mr. Howe appeared upon
the scene and ordered It taken back. He
told the man that he intended to use lum
ber from eight-hour mills only.
Lumber turned out at Davis & Lang
land's Western Planing Mill was refused
by Contractor Helbing, who is building a
house on JEUis street, near Franklin. The
Western Planing Mill is one of the firms
that signed the mlllowners' agreement,
and all but one of Its seven men Quit work
on Monday.
P. H. McCarthy, president of the Build-
Ing Trades Council, said last evening that
Le Cal & Ostrander of 116 Mission street
were running eight hours with a full com
plement of hands, as were the Mission
Planing Mill at 119 Main street and the
Humboldt Lumber Company in Oakland.
The council is especially juDilant over the
falling into line of tne Oakland mill,
which is one of the largest ln that city,
employing from thirty to forty hanas.
The mill oegan running on the eight-hour
basis yesterday afternoon.
The council held a meeting last evening
and discussed the developments of tne
day The various agents detailed to visit
the different' mills made their reports, all
ot which were satisfactory anu showed
gains for the union.
President McCarthy takes exceptions to
the published Interview with William
Crocker, wno presided over tne^eeUng
ot the millowners last Monday night anu
who is quoted as saying that politics is
behind the council's move.
â¢â¢some of those at tne nead of the af
fair " Mr. Crocker is quoted aa saying,
"are simply endeavoring to make political
capital out of tne lignt and they are leau
â¢â¢Tiiere is absolutely no foundation for
Mr Crocker's absurd statement," said
President McCarthy yesterday with con
siderable warmth. "If Crocwer had re
versed his statement and made it poli
tics on the side of the mlllowners, he
would have come nearer the truth. Kight
months ago we canvassed the different
mills for the purpose of sounding the own
ers in regard to tho eignt-hour rule. We
found practically every one in sympatny
with our cause, each owner expressing
himself as favorable to the plan, pro
vided we could make it unanimous. .Now
we are trying to make it so. The owners
were given six months to think it over,
arrange their contracts under the new
schedule, etc. Yet when the time comes to
carry out the agreement the majority of
them announce that they will not accede
to our request, but will continue to run
their shops nine hours a day.
"Now, if there is any politics back of
this thing it must emanate from the mill
owners themselves. If these men were
sincere when they professed to be in favor
of eight hours, provided we could make it
unanimous, let them co-operate with us
now and weÂ» will show them that we are
as good as our word in protecting the mill
owners of the bay district in handling
only the product of eight-hour mills. The
eight-hour day has come to stay. The
peoplo want it and no man, whether un
der a millowner or otherwise, can -pre
vent it. The sooner these gentlemen who
are in the mill business realize that the
Interests of the city can be best protected
by adhering to , the eight-hour rule, the
better." . . â ,
It was reported to the council last even
ing that one man who had gone out with
the other men Monday morning at the
Western, Planing Mill had returned to
â¢ work yesterday. Investigation showed,
however, that the man was not a. member
of theunion. ' .' ' â¢ .
There has been no conference yet be
tween the millowners and representatives
of the union, as the owners do not feel,
that there is any occasion Â¦ for such a
meeting. They are still firm in their de
termination to maintain the nine-hour
rule and the mills which the council claim
to have won over, the owners say, are
either very small or they never signed
the agreement. , .< .-.
A decided victory was claimed to-night
by the mill operatives when two of the
large Oakland concerns announced their
acceptance of the eight-hour scnedule.

decided toinight to refuse to handle buiid

where located, that works on any schedule
other than the eight-hour one. This stand
means that all the contractors will be
stamped as "unfair" who are building
with lumber from any #nill either In the
State or elsewhere working nine hours a
day. Notice-was also given that the coun

There are three hundred men employed
at this factory. As yet they havt madt

THE Fifth Congressional District Re
publican Committee met yesterday
afternoon in tho law office of W. H.
Cobb and resolved to call a primary
for the election of delegates to nominate
a candidate for Congress. It was sup
jx)sed until recently that the delegates
chosen for the Sta.te convention at Santa
Cruz from the Assembly districts within
the boundaries of the Fifth Congressional
I>ipirict v.-ou!d resolve themselves into a
district convention, but the committee
yesterday decided to follow the example
given by the Third and Fourth CongTos
s:onal districts, and order a. separate pri
mary.
Max Goldberg called the committee to
order and announced the purpose of the
meeting. The committeemtn present

In a few preliminary remarks Mr. Watt
ea;d he was convinced that the Fifth Dis

liarroony and pood politics should call a
separate Congressional convention. lie re
marked that there wae a good deal of
conflict ln the San Francisco County

to control its own affairs. He therefore
moved the adoption of the following reso

should be allowed its use until the State
builds an equal length to the south."
Acting Mayor Tobin asked if there was
any present need of extending the sea
wail south from China Basin, and liar,
bor Commissioner Herold replied to the
query.
"we contend," said Mr. Herold, "that
the proposed lease should be executed, but
it is also necessary for us to protect the
State's rights. I for one will state that
there Is no reason in the world why there
should be a foot of seawall built south
from China Basin for the next fifty years.
We have proposed that instead of the 5000
feet south, as llrst considered, the State
build 6000 feet of seawall from Mission
street south, connecting with the sea
wall built by the railroad, the latter then
to revert to the State."
Attorney Pillsbury said the railroad's
outlay would bo $1,000,000. The company
would be glad to pay rental for terminal
facilities, but the city could not furnish
them.
It is an unusual thing for a railroad,
Pillsbury continued, "to have to make such
an expenditure for terminal facilities that
we have a right to expect. But we only
ask the opportunity to do business and
fair treatment. Other transcontinental
roads are coming this way. Show them
an example of liberal treatment that will
encourage Kastern capital to invest here.'"
President Kilburn of the Harbor Com
missioners said that the board had always
favored the lease, and the only question
was as to details.
Should Be Liberal.
"It is my opinion," said F. J. Symmes
of the Merchants' Association committee,
"that we need a seawall south of China
Basin to-day. At least one foreign nation
is seeking docking facilities for a dozen
ships and a half a dozen others would
like such facilities if they could get them.
We make a mistake by not treating these
questions in a large-minded liberal man
ner that will let San Francisco live up to
its possibilities."
Major Harney of the Harbor Commis
sioners said that what the railroad really
wanted was the China Basin, and that
when the seawall reverted to the State the
railroad would still be allowed all the
facilities that its business demanded. He
was of the opinion that the State should
be required to build a seawall only from
Mission street to the southeasterly line of
Channel street.
Lieutenant Governor Xeff, called upon
for his opinion, spoke as follows:
"While I am in favor of the proposed
lease, I do not want to act for Governor
Gage until I have had a legal opinion on
the lease. I am waiting for that now and
am not ready to take action until I have
it. I approve of such enterprises and I
consider especially reprehensible certain
journals who never tire of attacking the
material Interests of the State as repre
sented in corporations. It Is well known
that capital does not come here as it
should. Our treatment of this question
and similar ones should be such as to en
courage other railroads and other enter
prises to come to us.
Commissioner Herold said that the
board's engineer had reported that build-
Ing 2300 feet of seawall south from China
Basin was impracticable. It was feasible
to build 1000 feet, which would carry it to
Eldorado street.
Attorney Pillsbury said the company
would be willing to accept that amend
ment. If building more was not feasible.
Captain Payson assented, and it is under
stood that the provisions of the lease will
be amended to that effect, ready for
adoption Monday.
Mrs. McDonald's Sad Plight.
The aid of Captain Seymour was enlist
ed last night by Mrs. McDonald, a mid
dle-aged woman. She wants the captain
to find her husband, who was to have
met her at the ferry yesterday upon her
arrival from Chicago. The husband
wrote that he was employed at the Union
Iron Works in this city, but inquiry there
disclosed the fact that he had left the
works two weeks ago and in company
with a man named Bainbridge had gone
to Seattle. Mrs. McDonald brought her
three small children along. She has no
means of support and the city may have
to care for them until the husband can
be located.
Mrs. Nobmann Seriously HI.
Mrs. Hannah Nobmann, proponent of
the Nobmann will, is seriously ill. When
the contest was again called for hearing
before Judge Hunt yesterday it was an
nounced that Mrs. < Nobmann had sub
mitted to an operation and was seriously
ill. The case. was then continued. Mrs.
Nobmann is the widow of Christopher
Xobmann, the pioneer grocer, and was
named as devisee to the bulk of his estate
which Is valued at J^),000. Heirs at law
of the deceased are contesting decedent's
will on the ground that it was obtained
by Mrs. Nobmann through undue influ
ence.
THE State Board of Harbor Commis
sioners yesterday afternoon again
postponed action on the execution
of the proposed lease of China Basin
to the San Francisco and San Joaquln
Valley Railroad, this time until next
Monday at 2 o'clock. The adjournment
was taken consequent to the announce
ment of Lieutenant Governor Neft, act
ing for Governor Gage, that ho was not
ready to vote on the question until he had
received the opinion of his attorney,
though he was in hearty sympathy with
the spirit and intent of the lease.
While no final action was taken, at least
one important compromise between the
applicant and the board was reached. At
torney E. S. Pillsbury for the Valley road
agreed that the lease should bo amended
so that the lensrth of the seawall which
the State must build south of the seawall
to be built by the railroad in order that
the last named Improvement shall revert
to the State, shall be 1000 feet instead of
2300, as first considered.
From expressions of opinion at the
meeting there Is little doubt that the
final action of the Commissioners will be
favorable to the granting of the lease.
Urge Granting of the Lease.
The meeting of the Commissioners was
attended by committees from the .Mer
chants' Association, the Chamber of
Commerce, the Federation of Mission Im
provement Clubs, and the Fairmoutjt and
Glen Park Improvement Club, all urging
the execution of the lease.
The Chamber of Commerce committee
consisted of George A. Xewhall, Henry
F. Fortmann, C. D. Haven and William
H. Marston.
The Merchants' Association committee
was composed of F. W. Dohrmann, C. S.
Benedict, A. M. Davis. Charles Bund
schu, J. R. Freud, L. M. King and F. J.
Symmes.
The representatives of the Federation
of Mission Improvement Clubs were Jo
seph Scheerer, I. Schwartz and J. Keller.
The committee of the Falrmount and
Glen Park Improvement Club consisted of
Joseph H. Heck, C. Stader, F. Fornier,
Thomas Crouch and Joseph P. Toohy.
Members of each committee addressed
the meeting and through all the speeches
there ran a tone of hopefulness for the
future commercial greatness of San Fran
cisco. Frequent expression was given to
the necessity of liberal and fair treatment
of a corporation whose coming meant 6O
much to trade.
By way of Introduction to the discussion
the following communication from the
Merchants' Association was read:
Some Changes Suggested.
To the Honorable the Board of State Harbor
CommtsRlonersâ Gentlemen: It Is universally
conceded that the dockage facilities In the har
bor of San Francisco have Ions been Inadequate
to the growing requirements ot thlB port, and
will no doubt in the near future prove a serious
drawback to the commerce of this metropolis.
The board of directors of the Merchants^ As
sociation has at various times considered this
subject, with the view of ascertaining the best
methods and means for remedying: this evil.
In our investigation of the provisions of a pro
posed lease of China Basin to the San Fran
cisco and San Joaquln Valley Railway Com
pany a recent visit of inspection was made
by our directors to the locality known as China
Haslr. and contiguous thereto. It is apparent
that the improvement of China Basin and the
construction of a seawall rrontingr thereon
would pro\-e of material value in the Increase
of dockage and wharfage facilities.
A careful examination of the terms of the
proposed lease of China Basin to the San Fran
cisco and San Joaquln Valley Railway Com
pany discloses the following: objections, which
we recommend should be corrected before the
execution of the lease of this property:
Firstâ The clause permitting the Board of
State Harbor Commissioners to construct
wharves, quays, docks, etc., "at any time,"
is of no value for the reason that unless the
State has an approach to the property from
land as well as water this privilege would be
of no use to the State. We therefore suggest
thnt the right to construct wharves, quays,
docks, etc., should take effect when the sea
wall haa been constructed from Us present ter
minus as far south ns Channel street, at which
time the railway company should agree to Rive
free and convenient access to the seawall from
Kentucky street ln front of China Basin at Buch
points as may be designated by the Harbor
Commissioners.
Good for City and State.
Secondâ The phraseology in the clause of the
loase which provides for an absolute relln
quishment on the part of the railway company
of the use of the seawall is somewhat indefi
nite and should be made clearer. In other
words. It may be Inferred from the wording
of the lease that the Harbor Commissioners
will be required to construct 6000 feet of seawall
to the south of China Basin bsfore that portion
north of it constructed by the railway com
pany reverts to the State. This seawall should
revert to the State as soon as the State shall
construct the Fame amount (about 2200 feet) to
the south of it and the j=Â»awall on the north
has been completed from Channel street to Its
present routhern terminus.
With the correction of these provisions ln the
lease we bÂ»lteve that Its execution would prove
to the best intersts of the city of San Fran
cisco and the State of California, The im
provement of China Basin and the construction
of this section of the seawall would give Im
petus to the Improvement of the entire water
front. It is estimated that these Improvements
will involve an expenditure of Jl.OW.OOO. of
which about $2."iO,C0O must be expended in the
construction of the eeawall within a period of
five years. This consideration, together with
the rental of $1000 per annum, as stipulated In
the lease, appears to be sufficient to warrant
the execution of the lease with the certainty
that the seawall will revert to the State as
soon as it can b utilized. We therefore hope
that the pending negotiations between your
honorable board and the San Francisco and
San Joaquln Valley Railway Company relative
to the proposed lease of China Basin will re
sult ln an agreement that will insure the con
struction of the contemplated improvements
promising to be of such material benefit to the
State of California.
A communication from the Chamber of
Commerce was read, stating that at a'
meeting Tuesday a resolution was adopt
ed approving the proposed lease. The
other orpanizations represented at the
meeting of the Commissioners had passed
similar resolutions, a
Payson Answers Objections.
Captain A. H. Payson, vice president of
the Valley road, spoke ln answer to the
objections stated by the Merchants'. As
sociation. He said that the company was
perfectly willing to adopt the idea and
the phraseologry of the communication in
the matter of the first objection.
"All we want," Captain Payson said,
"is to make certain of our exclusive use
of the strip until such time as it shall
revert to the State under the terms of the
lease. We are willing to provide for free
access to any wharves that the State
may build while the seawall is still our
property, but you can readily see that we
would want It arranged so that we could
not be practically deprived of the use cf
that 200-foot strip during that time by
the indiscriminate cuttlne through of
thoroughfares. All we gain in that pe
riod is the exclusive use of the strip. The
State abrogates none of its rights as to
dockage and tolls."
F. \V. Dohrmann. president of the Mer
chants' Association, explained that the
merchants had read the clause ln this
way: The lease provided for building'
wharves contiguous to the seawall, but
did not provide for access to them.
President Newhall of the Chamber of
Commerce, in behalf of his colleagues of
the committee, expressed their approval
of the objections made by the Merchants'
Association.
Henry F. Fortmann objected to . tTie
clause that provides that the State shall
build 2300 feet of seawall south from the
seawall built by the railroad before the
railroad seawall shall revert to the State.
He said that was* more than the State
ought to have to build, and besides, it
would cut off the Union Iron Works from
a froixtage. .Â¦
Big Saving to the State.
"The lease saves the State the construc
tion of 2300 feet of seawall; at a cost of
$250,000," said Attorney; E. S. Plllsbury.
"It is nothing more than - fair that we
