Emperor bas decided to remain behind."
WASHINGTON Aug 22 âThe Japanese Legation has received a telegram dated August 21 from the Foreign Office
at Toklo giving the following dispatch received yesterday from the Japanese acting Consul General at Shanghai:
"A dispatch received yesterday from a Chinese official at Paoting-Fu shows that by the Empress Dowager's
orders Husi Yung Yl Li Sh;m and Lien Yuen were executed on the 11th, and Yung Lu, who was to have
shared' the same fate 'is now in a Jail of the Judicial department and that the Emperor and the Empress Dow
ager left Peking on the 13th, 'escorted by Tung Fu Slang troops for Wutaishan via Chuchow and Tsechtangkwan.
Kang Ye, It Is further stated, has been appointed commander-ln-chlef of the Wu Wei army, while Princes Tu.an and
Chwang and Tsong Chi Kang Yl and Psui Tung have been ordered to remain at Peking. Another telegram dated
the leth ha. been received here from Paoting-Fu, to the effect that though' the Empress Dowager has left Peking, the
EXECUTED BY ORDER OF THE EMRRESS.
WASHINGTON. Aug 22. â The most important dispatch of the day was not made public by the War Department, but
was the subject of an extended conference at the White House this corning between the President, Secretary
Root and acting Secretary of State Adee. It was from General Chaffee and arrived about the same time as
the casualty list of the Peking fight. It was dated the 18th, and. therefore, was not a reply to the message
of Inquiry sent to General Chaffee by the War Department on Monday night. Still, It answered a number of the
Inquiries contained In that message. It dealt entirely with military operations and conditions. While it cannot be said to
have contained any bad news, and recorded the brilliant success of the American troops, who have borne themselves so
gallantly In the assault on Peking. It contained enough as to the unsettled conditions in China and the prospectof long
ard axduou* work In restoring peace to form the subject for a consultation of fome hours between the President and _is
advisers.
It was hoped In official circles that when General Chaffee should be heard from he would report that the work of
the* American expeditionary force had been accomplished by the rescue of the Ministers and that the blow struck at
the Boxer insurgents by the foreign column had dissipated the revolutionists and left China with hands free to make
her peace with the civilized world. Instead of this, however. General Chaffee had to report an utterly chaotic condition
of affairs and the capture of a capital whence all the heads of Government had fled. There was nothing for the victors
to do but to prevent anarchy by administering on this derelict empire which had fallen into their hands. Therefore
the prospect opened by General Chaffee' s dispatch is that the American contingent of necessity will be detained In
China for some time to come, probably for the whole winter. This will necessitate the hurried completion of prepara
tions that already have been begun to comfortably subsist our army through the severe winter weather which will
aocn close In en Northern China.
OUR TROOPS YET NEEDED IN CHINA.

The signal office contributed Its quota to the news in the following dispatch from Major Scrlven, chief signal officer of
the expedition, dated Peking, August 17: "City occupied. All well."
The signal office says that while this dispatch was several days in coming through to Washington there Js reason to be
lieve that the military telegraph line Is now working into the Chinese capital. Some delays are expected at first, as the line
Is eiroply an Insulated wire laid on the ground, there not being enough timber in that region to erect it on poles until lumber
or Iron poles are chipped in. Notice also was received at the department to-day that the Taku-Chefu cable is in working or
der. It Is thought there will soon be a direct and reliable line of wire communication from the War Department to General
Chaffce'B headquarters at Peking.
WASHINGTON. At:g. 22.â The military situation was of as much interest in to-day's developments as was the diplo
matic. Admiral R^mey reported early in the morning, bringing the story of the Peking operations up to the 16th in
Peking and confirming the report of the death of the gallant Captain Iteilly. Almost as important as the Peking
news In this dispatch was the statement that the Boxers are again concentrating around Tientsin, and that last
Sunday morning the Sixth Cavalry, with about 400 English and Japanese troops, had a lively brush with the Boxers
right mik-s outside of Tientsin, when about 100 of the Chinese were killed and five Americans were wounded. It was evident
from Admiral Remey's account of this affair that while the Chinese are In force enough around Tientsin to make consider
able show, they are evidently not In the humor to hotly contest an engagement. The casualty list in this fight seems to In
dicate a sudden and total rout. The text of Admiral Remey's dispatch Is as follows:
CHEFU, Aus. 21 (Taku, Aup. 20).â Dickens' command is landing to-day. Peking 16â All except imperial city cleared of Chinese
trocpÂ«; American troops first to enter Imperial city, have penetrated to the gates of the palace. Captain Reilly, Fifth Artillery, killed
on ;*:tb. On the morning ot tho 19th the Sixth Cavalry and about 400 English and Japanese dispersed about 1000 Boxers eight miles outside
ol Tientsin. About 100 Chinese were killed and five Americans wounded. Chaffee' s losses are six killed, thirty wounded, two days' fighting.
FOUGHT WITH BOXERS NEAR TIENTSIN.
Minister Congers :r.ov<-mÂ°r.ts are uncertain, but It is the disposition of the President, to meet his wishes half way.
There U reason to believe that before Mr. Conger la ordered to return to the United States or proceed to any point, he
will be consulted. Special Commissioner Rockhill has arrived, it is believed, at Nagasaki, and as soon as he reports he
will probably be sent to Peking to assist Mr. Conger, or to relieve him of his duties that tho Minister may obtain rest in
the interest of his health.
Mr. Cor.ger stated that the imperial family and court had pone westward, effectually disposing of the reports that the
Empress Dor.ager or Emperor was still within The forbidden city. His information on this joint is confirmed by the acting
Consul General of Japan at Shanghai, who states in a dispatch, dated August 20, that a Chinese official of Paoting-Fu
announces "that the Emperor and Empress Dowager left Peking on the 13th, escorted by Tung Fu Slang 1 ? troops for W'u
taiFhan, via Chuchow and Tsoshlngkwan." t'nder date of August 16. he wired that advices from Paoting-Fu were to
the effect that the Emperor had decided to remain in Peking. Before the Empress Dowager left she avenged the Vic
tory of the- allies by executing three of the leading members of the Progressive party and imprisoning Yung Lti.
What the allies shall do with the 1000 native Christians who passed through the siege with the foreigners is a question
that will have to be d^tf-rmined. It Is not desired to abandon them to the mercy of the northern people, and they will
probably be grivn transportation to Southern China, where they will stay among the treaty ports. Under her treaties
with foreign governments China specifically guarantees that no person who professes the Christian religion shall be inter
fered with or molested, and she being unable to meet this obligation, the powers will do all they can to extend protection to
r.ativos who are prcfcss<-d Christians.
Mr. Corner's declaration that "no representatives of the Chinese Government are In sight In Peking and condition?
are chaotic."' undoubtedly influenced the President in inserting in the answer to Li Hung Chang to-day the statement
that the United States would, when order was restored, appoint a representative to confer with the representative of the
"responsible and authoritative Government."
PEKING. Auj. 19.â Secretary of State. Washington: The entire rity. â¢with the exception of the imperial palace, is occupied by
.Tepanese. Ru*yian. British. American. French. It ir \mlnt; apportioned into districts for police supervision. The Chinese army fled. The
imperial family and the court have conÂ» westward, probably to S'.an-Fu, in the province of Shensl. No representatives of the Chinese
Government are In Fight In reking, and the conditions are chaotic. The palace Is expected to be taken Immediately. Many mission
aries have started for home, while others remain in charge of the Christian refugees, numbering about 1000. CONGER.
CALL Bt'REAT'. V.'EIXINGTON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. Aug - 22.â That no responsible governmental authority ex
1f:s In Pckir.g with which the foreign Minister? and allied commanders can deal is shown by the following dispatch, re
ceived by the State Department early this morning from Mlnistc Conger:
LATEST NEWS FROM MINISTER CONGER,
LONDON, Aug. 23, 4 a. m.â "To-day 1500 Americans attacked the Imperial Palace," says a
dispatch to the Morning Post from Peking, dated August 15, "and captured four of the
courts. The American flag is flying over the imperial granary, and the Imperial Bank has
been looted."
Describing events previous to the relief, the Morning Post correspondent cables: "On Au
gust 12 the Tsung li Yamen requested a conference with a view to peace. No armistice was grant
ed, however, and that night we endured the longest fusillade of the whole siege. It lasted twelve
hours. August 13 the Tsung li Yamen begged to be excused from any conference, saying that
the members were too busy. Later they wrote that they had forbidden firing on us, and would
court-martial any who disobeyed. During the evening many shells fell in the legation grounds."
The Daily Chronicle publishes an interview with the Japanese Minister in London, Kato Ta
kaki, which represents him as having! said:
"The Empress is the heart and soul of China. So long as she lives, so long as she remains
in China, whether the supreme power is taken from her or not, she will always be the greatest
force â the one above all others to be reckoned with. The difficulty will be to get any one who can
speak for her. I fear that the influence of Li Hung Chang is now of extremely little weight. The
powers must come to a final understanding quickly. Riots, anarchy, bloodshed and misery through
out China will be the inevitable result of a policy that does not immediately disclose itself. The
Government must be re-established."
The Japanese Envoy expressed his approval of the reported American suggestion regarding
a conference of the powers, and said he believed that satisfactory pecuniary compensation could
be secured if the resources of China were properly developed, despite the fact that her revenues are
pledged.
Field Marshal von Waldersee, according to the Daily Mail's correspondent, expresses the
opinion that his labors in China will be of long duration, "as pacification will be a difficult under
taking."
Three hundred and seventy-five thousand Russian troops are on their way to the Far East by
land and sea or are already there and under orders to embark. This statement is made by the Moscow
correspondent of the Daily Graphic, who adds that mobilization is in progress all over European
Russia, and that there are now at Odessa fourteen steamers chartered to take troops.
According to a St. Petersburg special, a telegram has been received at the Russian capital
from Shanghai announcing t\m departure of Li Hung Chang for Peking.
There Is No Longer Any Doubt That the Emperor and Empress
Dowager Have Fled, and the Chaotic Condition of the
Chinese Government May Be Followed by Anarchy and

CALL. BUREAU. WELLINGTON
HOTEL. WASHINGTON, Aug. 22.â
Although the conditions set forth in
the American" memorandum of Au-
gust 12 were not fulfilled and the
powers are compelled to effect the liber
ation of the representatives in Peking by
force of arms, the United States is willing
to use its good offices to bring about peace
for China,- insisting, however, that the
Chinese Government first establish order
in the Chinese capital and throughout the
empire. When this has been accomplished
this Government will be willing to appoint
a representative to -confer with the repre
sentatives of other powers and the author
itative and responsible Government * of
China to carry out the purposes described
in the American note of July 3, addressed
to the powers.
On the authority of a high official of the
administration. whom I saw to-night, the
foregoing may be accepted without re
serve as the gist of a memorandum hand
ed to Wu Ting Fang, the Chinese Minister
to .the United States, by Acting Secretary
of State Adee.
Considered by the Cabinet.
This response was carefully discussed at
the Cabinet meeting yesterday when the
grave question as to the ability of the Im
perial Government to administer affairs in
China was raised. Further advices re
ceived by the State and War departments
to-day convinced the officials of the lnad
visabllity of. calling into question, except
In the most indirect manner, the strength
of the present recognized Government of
China. . Â¦ . â¢ 'â¢. ' :
The reply was drafted to-day. during a
conference of more than three hours be
tween the President, Secretary Root and
Acting Secretary Adee at the White
House. Consideration of American in
terests largely influenced the President in
deciding again to place the good offices of,
the United States at the disposal of China.
In his response * to the first appeal cf
Kwang Su the President stated that
should certain conditions, \ which he
named, including the liberation of the
legations, the protection of foreigners and
the restoration of order, be fulfilled, he
believed that "no obstacle will, be found
to exist on the part or the powers to an
amicable settlement of all questions aris
ing out of the recent troubles, and the
friendly good offices of this Government
will with the assistance of other power3
be cheerfully placed at your Majesty's
disposition for that purpose."
Powers Should Withdraw.
It is regarded as Important, If American
interests are to be conserved, that th*e
powers withdraw from China as speedily
as possible. The occupation of Niu
chwang by Russia, the landing of British
troops at Shanghai, the prospect that
troops of other nations will be landed
there and the necessity for keeping for
eign troops in China carry with them
complications of a most dangerous char
acter, with the possibility that the powers
concerned will not be willing to relinquish
their grip on the empire' If their troops
are long retained In her territory.
China must, of course, pay , an indemn
ity, and it is apparent that the indemnity,
if it includes the expense of retaining the
troops for any length' of time, will be
so enormous. that China will never be able
to pay, it. In such case, the powers,.un
able to'collect the sum demanded.- would
in' all probability announce -that they pro
posed to remain on Chinese soil until

MURPHY TO DIRECT THE
CAMPAIGN IN NEW YORK
NEW YORK, Aug. 22.â Former United
States Senator Edward Murphy came to
this city to-day and met Richard Croker
at the Hoffman House. At the. close of
the conference it was announced that Mr.
Murphy will remain here until after the
election. Mr. Murphy said he expects to
co-operate with the State' committee for
the election of Bryan. Mr. Croker gave
out a statement to the effect that he recog
nized Murphy as the actual Democratic
leader of the State. It has been said that
in several days Murphy intends to open
State headquarters independent of tho
Democratic State Committee.
Ex-Senator Murphy made a statement
to-night in the course of which he said:
"Up to the present time there has been
absolutely no work done to perfect the
harmony that mTist exist in the Derao
ctatic party in New York State to insure
success at the ensuing election. A.gentle
man, who four years ago left our party,
is to-day on a tour of the Western part
of the State planting the seeds of discon
tent among Democrats. For the "purpose
of frustrating the schemes of this gentle
man and "his associates, all loyal Demo
crats should band together. It is claimed
that Richard Croker is seeking the Stuta
leadership. This is absolutely false."

FRANCE HAS ADVANTAGE ON
IMPORTATION OF CORDIALS
Obtained a Seduction "Under the Com
mercial Treaty Which Others
I^egkcted to Ask For.
"WASHINGTON*. Aug. 22.â The Secre
tary of the Treasury has decided that
certain spirit?, known as "cordials," "li
queurs," "arrack," "absinthe," etc., which
und^r the commercial treaty with France,
eif-r.ed May 13. i>:!*. are admitted Into this
country at a reduction in the customs
duty from $2 2". per proof gallon to 1175,
are not entitled to the same or any privi
l'-tre onder the treaties recently negoti
ated with Portugal. Germany and Italy.
TirÂ» distinction arises from the fact that
while in the Kngiish version of the French
treaty the "cordials," "liqueurs,** etc., do
not appear, the memoranda and repre
sentations made by this Government at
The time the negotiations were pending
did expressly include them, as did the
Preach version of the treaty itself, so
that it has been held by the courts that
Th<-y were intended to- be included.
On the other hand, the language of the
Portuguese, German and Italian treaties,
which is the same in each, is construed
by the Treasury Department to be lim
ited by the provisions of paragraph 2S9
of the tariff act. which relates solely to
brandies and other spiritous liquors, as
distinguished from paragraph 292, relat
ing to cordials, liqueurs, etc The effect
of this ruling â¢will be that while France
will have ihe benefit of the very mate
rial reduction of the duties on these arti
clep. the other countries named will not
be on any better footing as relates to
them than they were previously. It is
probable, therefore, that new troa.ties will
nave to be n?potlated which will put the
other countries on the same footing with
France.

CAPTAIN HENRY J. REILLY, FIFTH ARTILLERY, U. S. A., KILLED
IN PEKING AUGUST 17.
The official casualty list sent by General Chaffee from Peking on the 17th
inst.. and received at Washington yesterday, confirms the .press reports of
the death of Captain Henry J. Reilly, Battery F, Fifth Artillery. He was
killed on the morning of the day the list was sent off. That this happened
the third day after the entry of the American troops into the city indi
cates that they have had some heavy work even after effecting the relief of
the legations.
Captain Reilly was a brave and highly esteemed officer, who had won hia
promotions by force of merit. Though born in Ireland, he had devoted his
life from his youth to the service of his adopted country. He was born Sep
tember 24. 1S3G. and enlisted in the United States navy in February, 1S63, join
ing the Mississippi squadron at Cairo, 111. He was engaged in running the
batteries at Yicksburg. In the action at Grand Gulf. Miss., in tho first Red
River expedition, and in the final bombardment of Vicksburg until its' sur
render July 4. 1863. He was honorably discharged from the navy in 1864, and
in September of that year enlisted in the Fifth Artillery, to which com
mand he belonged until his death, though at times detached on special and
volunteer service, as in the yellow fever epidemic at the Tortugas, in 1867.
After promotions to corporal and sergeant he was appointed second lieuten
ant December 1. 1S66. and first lieutenant September 18, 1S68. He graduated
with honors from the Artillery School at Fortress Monroe in 1S76, and Jan
uary 3, 1891, was made captain of Battery F, then stationed at the Presidio,
where it remained until the latter part of 1S97, when it was ordered East.
At the opening of the Spanish-American war he was ordered with his bat
tery from Fort Reilly, Kansas, to Fort Hamilton, New York, and later to
Cuba, where he took part in the Santiago campaign. After the close of the
war he returned to Fort Hamilton, where he remained until April, 1899. when
he sailed for the Philippines. In June he was ordered with hia battery to
China, arriving at Taku with the Fourteenth Infantry July 24.
In the advance of the allies to Peking his battery did splendid service and
was mentioned in the dispatches for gallantry at Yangtsun, Hosiwu, Matau
and other points where the Chinese disputed their passage.
It is to be deeply regretted that this gallant officer met his death just
after success crowned the efforts of the expedition in which he bore so impor
tant a part. During his five years' stay with his command at the Presidio 1
Captain Reilly made a great many waVm friends in this city, both in mili
tary and social circles, who will deeply regret his loss. He left a widow who
is now at Fort Hamilton, New York, and four children. His son, Henry J.
Reilly Jr., entered West Point In June last.

AKRON. Ohio, Aug. 22.â Two persons
are known to have been killed, several
maimed, and for hours to-night the streets
of Akron were filled with a wild, uncon
trollable mob. The trouble was the out
come of an unsuccessful attempt to lynch
a~ negro who is charged with a brutal as

A large crowd gathered about the city
prison to-night at 8:30 o'clock and forced
In the doors. The prison was soon
packed with the mob and the officers of
fered no resistance, as Peck earlier in the
evening had been quietly taken away to
Cleveland.
To satisfy the mob the officers suggest
ed that a committee of six be appointed to
search all the cells and go through every
part of the building. This was done, and*
as the negro was not found a yell was,
"Now for the County Jail. Give us the
'nigger' and we will deal with him."
Rush to the Jail.
A mad rush followed for the jail and
soon the jail was in the hands of the mob.

ter down the big iron doors. Deputy Sher

and made a speech.

not be found there, and he told the people
in the mob to select a committee and he
would allow the committee to search the
jail from top to bottom. A committee was
quickly selected and the jail was searched,
every cell being entered. Satisfied that
the negro was not there, the mob then
rushed across the street and forced open
the doors of the county courthouse. The
old courthouse was soon packed and all
rooms searched, except the rooms in the
treasury department. A start was made
to tear oft the iron doors of the treasury
department, but the mob decided not to
tackle the Job, and then the thousands of
men and boys again rushed back to the
city prison, crying for the blood of Peck.
The city prison was again surrounded
and hundreds of people forced their way
into the prison for the second time, in
sisting that Peck was there. Mayor
Young at this time appeared at one of
the windows in the upper part of the
building.
He addressed the mob as best he could,
saying that Peck had been taken out of
the prison at 4 o'clock by Sheriff Kelly
and driven out of the city in a closed car
riage. The people in the mob would not
believe the Mayor and continued to yell
and demand that Peck be surrendered. "â¢

one in the crowd began shooting 1 at the
building. This was followed by several
more shots. Tho officers In the building
appeared at the windows and then shot
over the heads of the mob. A man with a
shotgun then fired at the officers.
It is said that several : officers were
wounded. The crowd then began to smash

tho firing became general. Hundreds of
shots were exchanged and one boy was
carried dead from the street. It is cer
tain that dozens of men were .wounded.

"I cannot have her here. She is
bound to have her own way no
matter who she might kill. She
has nearly killed me."
ONE of the most sensational documents Introduced In the Townsend case
was Incorporated yesterday in an affidavit filed by Public Adminis
trator Patrick Boland. It Is an excerpt from a letter written by Mrs.
Almira S. Townsend to her brother-4n-Iaw, Charles C. Crawford, five
days before she died. In this letter Mrs. Townsend wrote most bitterly
against her daughter, Mrs. Ella P. Murray, accusing her of various offenses
and complaining dramatically that sue had come herg without Invitation. Up
on this letter Van R. Paterson based his sensational assertion that Mrs.
Ella F. Murray was responsible for her mother's death. The excerpt from
the epistle Is aa follows:
Dear C: Ella is here. When I got out at 1221 California street
on the eve of the 9th. I found her sitting in the hall. "Well it
shocked me so for a few minutes I was almost breathless. I mailed
a letter on the Oth at 5 o'clock to her, and she was in the Palace
Hotel opposite -when I mailed the letter. You can imagine what an
awful state I was in. She left in a few minutes for the hotel, and
soon after I Â¦went to the hotel and had quite a time with her. I told
her she had no right to come without my consent. The next evening
when I called she was all packed to start back. I told her she must
stay for awhile. So she will stay for a month. I cannot have, her
here. She is bound to have her own way no matter who she might
kill. She has nearly killed me. I had to go to the doctor. I was
hardly able to hold my head up and can hardly get around the
house
My God she is crazy I am sure or she would never have done
this thing. She is the most determined of all human beings. I may
have sent you this before. I can't tell, for am writing so much now.
I am so shocked I cannot use ink Â¦without defacing all I write you.
Brother Charles, write me a postal if you have my letters. Eliza is
all broke up over Ella's actions. > '
the name of Townsend. I have always
cautioned you against such a folly.
In regard to my coming to California,
it would f ji ;ri great pleasure and a
great honoF'for me to do so, and I
appreciate your kindness and courtesy
very much I assure you. But my
convenience and pleasure Is secondary
to your Interest and the peace of all
the family concerned. I know your
business matters and interests should
bo attended two at once, especially
your Bank accounts In Lowell.
Charlestown, E. Boston and City of
Boston, is of an apparent necessity for
you to attend to at once. Don't leave
those things till it two late.
"You Should Make Your 'Will to
Ella."
My. brother died less than a year ago,
Any private matters write on a sepe
rate leaf for me. In retard T.
Â¦Letter I should take no notice of it or
him. Whatever his object may be Is
evidently of no good will to you, but
to get a corrispondence with you and
see what you say; don't notice him.
Don't know what Ella will think or
say In regard to It. I can't see that
he can do anything In the matter, even
should he be inclined to do so. Your
divorce from him cuts him off from
any claim. You should never kept
row (Sunday) with Tom' s letter.
Eliza told Ella that you was to send
1 letter and she would bring It out.
Be careful what you write me for
Ella Is Indignant because we do not
bring every letter of yours to her to
read. Write me nothing but what you
want Ella to see, and sign, AI..MIRA â
s The records introduced by the attorneys
for Mrs. Murray were of great import
ance. The first was the document proving
that Thomas T. Townsend had been di
vorced from his second wife on July 24,
1SS0. in this city. The second record was
one in the marriage license records of this
city dated January 24, 1SS3, in which
Thomas T. Townsend applied for a license
to marry his third wife and in which he
swore there was no legal impediment to
his proposed union.
The next document produced by the at
torneys was a copy of the decree of di
vorce granted to Almira S. Townsend from
Thomas T. Townsend by the Supreme Ju
dicial Court of Massachusetts on Novem
lÂ» r 11. 1'3/ij. When that divorce was grant
ed there was a law in Massachusetts for
bidding divorced persons to marry again.
In order not to violate this law Thomas T.
Townsend made an appeal which seems
conclusively to destroy any possible claim,
he might have had to the estate of the
dead woman. On January 16, 1871, he ap
pealed to the Supreme Judicial Court of
Massachusetts for permission to marry i
again. He recited the facts of his divorce ,
from Almira S. Townsend and in that
recital admitted the legality of the decree.
I^e now has the temerity to say that he is
the surviving husband of the dead woman.
Hassett Pleads in Vain for Time.
After a few minor points In the case
were covered the attorneys for Mrs. Mur
ray announced that their case was closed.
Attorney Hassett then renewed his mo
tion for a continuance, asking this time
until September 22, in order that he may
obtain the depositions of witnesses in
Massachusetts. Mr. Hassett said that he
expected to prove by these witnesses that
Mrs. Murray never intended to remain In
this city. The appeal for a continuance
was based, on an affidavit of Public Ad
ministrator Boland. In this affidavit was
the sensational letter of Mrs. Townsend,
written five days before her death. Judge
Dunne refused to grant a continuance,
and the case, as far as ..Irs. Murray's
claim Is concerned, will probably be fin
ished to-day. Thomas T. Townsend dors
not have to present his case imtll the 30th
lnst.
The attorneys for Mrs. Murray have
produced another extremely Interesting
letter which has a bearing on the case.
It is from Charles C. Crawford to Mrs.
Almira S. Townsend, and was written on
May 19. 1900. In this epistle Crawford
urges Mrs. Townsend to make her will at
once in favor of her daughter Ella. The
letter is in full as follows:
E. Boston, 43 Chelsea street, Satur
day, May 19, 1900.
My Dear Sister: Eliza mailed you a
letter this morning, wrote yesterday.
May the 18. I have just received a
letter from you dated May 13. Enclos
ed Thomus Townsend's letter and
stamps. We was going to Ella's to

away .to-day so we shall go to-mor-
DRAMATIC INCIDENTS IN LE&AL BATTLE FOR THE TOWNSEND ESTATE.
THE struggle of Mrs. Ella F. Murray.
Public Administrator Boland and
Thornae T. Townsend to secure tt e
f.rst firm grasp on the estate of Mrs.
Almira 8. Townsend is losing none of its
FPDFatlonal interest. The proceedings be
fore Judge Frank H. Dunne yesterday
were replete with exciting Incidents.
which ranged from & threat of punish
ment for contempt to a deliberate accusa
tion of forgery against one of the wlt
r.esses. Ex-Judga J. F. Sullivan, one of
the attorneys for Mrs. Ella F. Murray,
was threatened with punishment for con
tempt if he did not desist from conduct
â¢ â¢which the court considered unseemly.
A Mrs. Murray was on the stand under
cross-examln&tlon, ar.d added emphasis to
i-tr assertions that San Francisco and not
.Dorchester is her home. She threw somu
cir&nge sida lights on the relations be
tween her mother and herself, and fre
Â«jaently g^ve evidence that ehe is the pos
sessor of & very vigorous temper and a
enarp tonguÂ«. Subsequent developments
fat the day revealed some remarkable coiÂ»
'tradletions between her picture of tha ro
â¢Jauons between her mother and herself
sand the outline of thesa relations as Mrs.
Â¦^Towr&enC drew them.
Mrs. Murray swore that her mother
ffa&d* ber iwear never to leave San Fran
ciBco. and ft telegram from Mrs. Town-
IMiiA to Mrs. Murray announcing that the j
another woeld go to the daughter or the
Cancfctisr must come to the mother Is al
trttL&r tn evidence. Yet five days before
â¢ he &t& Mr*. TcrBraeend wrote that her
iCaxxghzer must ha/re been crazy to come
{2iere as the glfl. &nd that she w&t a
fwonum who would have her own way, no
(tEAtter vrhoa ehÂ© might kill. These re
s&arfcA&l* assertions and contradictions
â¢develop (KM of the strangest phases of
the case.
CToroisendiaid Mrs. Smith on the Grill
As tar as can be seen the proceedings of
J-eBterday removed Thomas T. Townsend,
the ex-hus^amd of the dead woman, as a
Stxtor In the case. Townsend has been
extremely fortuns.te In not swearing that
be is the surviving husband of Mrs. Town
eend, as If ho had dons 60 he would have
been arrested for perjury. Copies of the
3-eoords ot the Supreme Judicial
Cuurt of Massachusetts produced
yesterday not only showed con
clusively that Mrs. Townsend secured a
divorce regularly, bttt that four years |
later, in 1S74, Thomas T. Townsend, recog- i
. oizing the complete legality of the de- |
f cree. begged the Supreme Judicial Court I
:o permit him to marry again. These
records destroyed completely any founda
tion which Townsend may have had for
a. claim against the estate of his divorced
wife.
As ml^ht have been expected, M. C.
H&ssett, attorney for Public Administra
tor Boland. was very much in evidence,
again acting practically as the attorney
fÂ»jr Townsend. Judge r>unne asked him
if he were acting for any one In addition
to the Public Administrator, but Ha^sett
insisted that he waÂ» not. He then made
the significant assertion that he is con
vinced that Mrs. Ella F. Murray is the
daughter of Mrs. Townsend. thus remov
liig another complication from the case.
rs'ot the least significant incident of the
day was the appearance of Mrs. Bessie
Tracy Bxnith upon the stand. The lady
v.as extremely cautious, refusing, under
the most persistent questioning, to admit
even her own handwriting. When the
bogus will was shown to her by Attorney
Malt I. Sullivan she "most solemnly
swore" that she had never seen It in her
life before and did not write It. Attorney
Euilivan says that his purpose in ques
tioning Mrs. Smith was to establish a
basis for a charge- of perjury In connec
tion with other criminal accusations which
he intends to make. Judge Dunne re
fused to a: low the alleged will to be Intro
duced as evidence.
Mrs. Toirasend as a Sinrant
When court convened Mrs. EUa K.
Murray resumed her place on the witness
â¢tare! under the cross-txaminatlon of At
torney Hassett. The Questioner made
Â«very effort to draw from the witness a
admission that when she left Dor-
A'.ester for this city in July it was her
j-urpose to return. Mrs. Murray em
phatically denied that such had been her
purpose, but Hassett persisted and elicited
certain answers which had an important
besxlnc cpon his contention that Mrs.
Murray really never intended to make
this city the permanent place of her
frbode. In answer to queries she declared
th&t she left Boston on July 5 and arrived
in this city on the afternoon of July i,
Xoicg at once to the Palace Hotel and
later In the evening to her mother's ho.ne
At 1221 California street.
"When you went to your mother's home
that night," asked Hassett, "was ehe at
JiomeT*
"ShÂ© was not, but she came in later and
I caw and talked with her," was the
reply.
"What did rhe say?" the attorney ask
ed. The question was an Important one
"You do not appear for any one besides
the Public Administrator in this case, do
you, Mr. Hassett?"
"No, sir." was the reply, "but I want
to have the record clear."
"You do not appear for Mr. Townsend,
do your* asked the Judge. : >^'-
There was a suppressed laugh in the
courtroom as Hassett said again: "No,
sir."
After a series of futile questions Mrs.
Smith was excused and the will episode
as far as that court is concerned was
closed. Mrs. Murray's attorneys then pro
ceeded to discuss the standing of Thomas
T. Townsend in the case. Again Attorney
HaEfett objected so eagerly that Judge
Dunne asked:
Townsend's Fatal Appeal.
When the bogus will was presented to
her, however, she gave it a casual glance
and replied quickly: "I never saw that
document In my life before. I most sol
emnly swear that it Is not in my hand
writing."
Attorney Sullivan then sought to Induce
Mrs. Smith to identify her own handwrit
ing, but she positively declined to do so
on the ground that the samples shown to
her had been out of her hands, and she
would not swear positively that they were
hers, although they looked like hers.
Judpe Dunne, however, would not allow
the alleped will to be Introduced In evi r
dence. He declined to permit the attor
neys for Mrs. Murray to establish a basis*
for other proceedings, and Insisted thut
the inquiry be confined to certain well
defined limits.
"If I prove that this alleged will Is a
forgery and this witness is the forger I
submit that the matter is of grave im
portance. We have received what pur
ports to be a will. We believe that It is
bogus and that this woman on the wit
ness stand wrote it. I can prove to an
absolute certainty that the document is
a forgery and that the witness wrote it."
Attorney Sullivan replied:
The next Important witness was Mrs.
Bessie Tracy Smith, the woman around
whom so much of what is of sensational
interest in the case has revolved. Mrs.
Smith was placed upon the witness eland
by Attorney Matt I. Sullivan for the sole
purpose of trying to prove that the will
sent to Miss Rattipan Is a forgery and
thpt Mrs. Smith is the forger. The at
torneys battled long over this attempt.
Attorney Ha=sett resisting it strenuously.
He contended that the only issues in the
case were the relationship of Mrs. Mur
ray to Mrs. Townsend and the question
of the former's residence. Xo will had
been presented nor even suggested, and
a discussion of one could find no place in
court.
Ex-Judge Sullivan arose, apologized
again and said that he would not again
offend In the particular in which the
court found offense. Mrs. Murray's cross
examination was almost ended. A few
minor questions Â¦were asked oxid she was
excused.
Mrs. Smith Charged With Forgery.
"Judge. Sullivan, you have frequently
acted this morning In an unseemly man
ner. When I havo called your attention
to the matter you have apologized, but
that does not remedy the matter. If this
thing occurs again I will have to consider
you in contempt of court. Do not try the
patience of the court too far."
These Questions and answers and a
series of others appeared to amuse At
torney J. F. Sullivan greatly and he fre
quently laughed loudly. His actions an
gered Judge Dunne, who said sharply:
"1 have!" the witness replied, almost
shontlngr. "It was my mother's wish that
she should be burled with my daughter."
"You have made preparations to send
your mother's remains to Dorchester,
have you not?" asked the cross-exam
iner.
old woman said that her daughter had
prepared to return the day after her ar
rival, but would stay for a month.
Townsend had written and in which the
"One day I met my mother In the corri
dor of the hotel," said the witness, "and
she took me by the hand, saying: 'I want
you to promise me solemnly never to leave
this city a^ain until I tell you to do so
and that you may go.' I gave her my
solemn promise that I would do so."
"You never packed your effects at the
Palace and prepared to go home, did
you?" asked Hassett.
"No, sir!" snapped the witness, who
did not know of the letter which Mrs.
and the answer was etartllng and unex
pected.
"My mother told me." said Mrs. Murray.
"that she had sold the house and could
not let me remafn there that night. 'I've
6old this house,' she said, "and I am
working here as housekeeper for $50 a
month. I have taken a small room on
the top floor and I can hardly turn around
In it. You cannot stay here to-night.' "
Mrs. Murray then told of her plajis to
secure apartments In a hotel and remain
here at her own expense. Her mother,
she said, refused to let her do this and
insisted that she take better apartments
at the hotel to be paid for by Mrs. Town
send.

PERSISTS IN HER DENIAL.
Mrs. Bessie Smith Solemnly Swear3
She Never Wrote the Alleged
Forged Will.
In spite of all the evidence Sullivan &
Sullivan promise to produce and with
which they expect to prove the guilt of
Mrs. Bessie Tracy Smith, the lady still
positively denies that she had anything
to do with the alleged forged will.
Mrs. Smith was prostrated after her
brief experience in court yesterday. "It
was an awful ordeaJ." she said. "I wish
that all those questions that were object
ed to had been permitted. I am only too
anxious to state all I know. I solemnly
swear," continued Mrs. Smith, "that I
never wrote that will and that I never
saw It in my life before. I am willing to
go into any court and take the most sol
emn oath to that effect."
Even If the question of the will forgery
la not brought up again by Sullivan &
Sullivan, the matter is not likely to re
main in abeyance. Mrs. Smith declares
she will push the matter to an Issue and
promises to take legal advice with that
end in view.
CHRETIEN IN THE ROLE
OF COMPLAINING WITNESS
Swears to a Complaint Charging M.
y C. Agramonte With Felony
- V Embezzlement. . ,
John M. Chretien, the disgraced attor
ney, appeared before Judge Cabanlss yes
terday afternoon In the role of com
plaining witness. He was guarded by
Deputy Sheriff Dougherty and after
swearing to a complaint was taken back
to the county jail.
The complaint to which he swore charg
ed M. y C. ARramonte with felony em
bezzlement. Chretien explained that in
1S90 he and his wife became sureties for
Agramonte when he was appointed agent
in Mexico for the Pacific Mutual Life Iiv
surance Company. May 24, ISM, he was
notified by the company that Apramonte
was a defaulter to the extent of $1423. and
the company entered suit on the bond to
recover the amount. A compromise was
effected by the payment of $750.
Agramonte left the country, but about
a week ago Chretien noticed In a news
paper that he was again In the city and
had attended a banquet of the Guate
malan colony. Chretien at once notified
Attorney Barnes, who with the assistance
of a private detective located Agramonte
and he promised to meet Barnes yester
day and arrange to liquidate his indebt
edness. He did not appear and It was
learned that he had started for Mexico
yesterday morning. The police will en
deavor to intercept him at Fresno and
have him brought back.

The
Way
Women W^JIm,
Work. \"Mi
It's enough to wear any one out.
First it's washing, in damp and draft.
Then it's ironing with the hot stove and
the hard work to endure. And in be-
tween whiles, meals to get, house to
clean, I and children to tend. It's bad
enough for a well woman but for a weak
woman it's slow torture. Dr. Pierce's
Favorite Prescription cures the diseases
of the delicate organs which weaken
women. It makes weak women strong
and sick women well.
, Sick women are invited to consult Dr.
Pierce by letter, free of charge. All
correspondence strictly private. Address
Dr. R. V. Pierce, Buffalo, N. Y.
" My health is the best now that it has been
for four years," Â¦writes Mrs. Phebe Morris, of Ira,
Cayuga Co., N. Y., Box 52. "I have taken but
two bottles of your medicine, 'Favorite Pre-
scription ' and ' Golden Medical Discovery.'
These medicines have done me more good than
all that I have ever taken before. Before I took
your medicines I vrza sick in bed nearly half the
time. I couldn't do my work ouJv about half
the time, and now I can work nil the time for a
family of four. My advice to alt who are troub-
led with female weakness is to take Dr. Pierce's
Favorite Prescription and ' Golden Medical Dis-
covery'â the most wonderful medicines in the
world."
Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets sweeten
the breath.

NEW YORK, Aug. 22.-Judgins from
the work Fitzsirnmons lias been doins in

at Coney Island Friday night, the former
heavyweight champion will take lots nf
beating u lien he meets the sailor. Every
conceivable fcrm of exercise conducive to
t- trer.fUh and lining one thoroughly for the
fx*ntfrfft ot *>kill and endurance has been
practiced by Fitztimmons Miiee he fias

As a iitult, me Australian looks sturd

and blocking blows than marked his ef
forts In liie tariy part .it" the battle with
the "AJcron tjiant. " There were periods
during the Huh!in-Fitzsiramons contest
Â«~hea "Lanky Hob" caused his backers a
lot of uneasiness due to lack of judgment
of distance and inability to block ulows
EUCcexsfaUy. While the increase in Kitz
eimmons' speed has been marked, it would
he an exaggeration to say that he is a*
fast with hi* hands and on his feet as lie
ever was. He believes he can beat au>
heavywelgrht in the world. Kitz^imm^ns
tays that he polished off Sharkey when
be sot ready in their battle in California.
but owing to unfairness on the part ot
Wya.il Earp. the referee, he was not
credited with victory. Karp awarded the
bout to Sharkey on a foul.
As matters stand lo-day Sharkey feels
that he has the b'.st of tliiugs. His
knowledge of the game has increased
greatly t-ince he fought Fitfcf-immons. His
alUing power is alt-o greater, and alto
pet her he is much more active than his
rival is likely to be on Friday night.
"When I'm feeling all right." said Fltz
simmons to a Call correspondent, "1 never
CivÂ« my weight a thought. If 1 feel well
1 know" my hitting- power is there and my
spe<*d also. Sharkey may have ten or
twenty pounds the best of it in weight.
l>ut that advantage gives me no concern.
I am confident that I can l>eat him just
as easily as if I weighed 200 pounds After
J dispose of Sharkey I will probahly ar
ranse a contest with Jeffries or the win
ner of the McCov-Corbett bnut. If Cor
hett wins over McCoy he can have first
call, otherwise I will take on Jeffries for
the championship. 1 give Corbett prefer
ence because be has all along claimed
that 1 beat him through foul means a.t
Carson. Some people think I'm an old
fellow and that Corbett would have the
i.pst of it if we were to meet now. I can
beat Corbrtt at any old age. and if he
dmibts it, let him step up to the captain's
office and sign articles for a right with
me."

/ .
An organization of sportsmen which la
particularly fortunate in the matter of
hunting grounds is the newly formed
Point Reyes Sportsman's Club, the roll of
membership of which already Includes the
names of many of San Francisco's best
known rod and gun wielders. A meeting
of the members was held yesterday, at
which permanent organization was ef
fected.
The clyb has leased 18,000 acres of
splendid cover and quail land in Marin
County, at Point Reyes, formins what is
known as the O. L. Shatter estate. The
lease calls for a five years' tenanture,
with privilege of renewal at the close of
the term. The land is in two sections, one
lying over toward BoUnas. while the oth
er, a few miles to the north, is in what is
known as the U'.ema district, and fronts
on Tomales Bay as far as the ocean, tak
inp in part of Limintor Bay.
The estate has long been celebrated as
one of the best ueer runs in the State, the
rigid game Jaws of Mailn having pre
served them from the inroads of the pot
hunter. In Stimson Lagoon the club has
a fine duck water. Sea brant also make
frequent appearances here, this and Eu
reka Bay being almost the only places in
the State where this favorite game bird
is found. On the hillsides inland are the
quail grounds, while further back is the
deer cover. The grounds will be patrolled
by numerous keepers to assure preserva
tion of the game.
Several members have already joined,
among them being R. P. Upham. Colonel
J, Barrere, S, E. Slade, F. Vernon, W. S.
Leake, W. J. Martin and E. L. Sargent.
The membership will be limited to twenty
in the interest of good sport.
The officers are: President. General John
H. Dickinson; vice president. Colonel D.
E. Miles; secretary and treasurer, Horace
O'Rear.
The grounds were shot over for the first
lime on the 19th inst. by General Dickin
son and a party, a five-forked buck, dress
ing at 1L>5 pounds, falling under the
former's aim.
BOSTON, Aug. 22.â The feature of tho
grand circuit meet at Keadville this after
noon was the big Massachusetts stake for
$10,000, the fifth renewal for 2:12 trotters,
and Thomas W. Lawson's Boralma won In
straight heats. Despite the fact that the
gelding was noticeabi-v lame in his oft
hind leg, he made a new mark for him
self as well as for the event, 2:09Â»Â£. In
none of the heats did he extend himself.'
so that his performance is looked upon as
one of the greatest feats of the 'year and
places him well up among the fastest
trotters on the turf. iJoralma was barred
in the betting.
Joe Watts, another favorite, won the
2:17 trot. The other two events went to
outsiders.
C. J. and Harry Hamlin's bav gelding.
The Abbott, trotted a pretty nfile and cut
his own time half a second to 2:05%.
The Massachusetts was the first race of
the day and twelve ol the fifteen horses
nominated faced the starter in the first
heat. With Boralma out in the betting.
Big Timber was played for a place, close
ly followed by Lord Derby and Lady Ger
aldine. The last named horse had the
pole, but broke almost immediately. Bor
alma was soon in the lead with Big Tim
ber well up. On entering the stretch
Geers sent Lord Derby Into second place
and managed to get within a neck of the
favorite at the wire.
The second heat was the best of the
race, for Boralma and Lord Derby ran
neck and neck almost from the quarter
pole, and at the wire it looked like a dead
heat. The time was 2:09^, a new record
for Boralma, but the same might be said
for Lord Derby. Boralma seemed to have
something in reserve, while Geers had to
push Lord Derby hard to get near the
Lawson horse.
In the second heat Boralma., Lord Derby
and Big- Timber were together to the
turn. Boralma, however, had the speed,
and while Lord Derby was punished se
verely, he could get only as far as his
rival's wheels.
The crowd - played Bob Fitzslmmons
strongly in the 2:08 pace, but Free Bond
had little difficulty in taking the first
heat. Courier Journal being beaten by a
half length.
' The second heat looked like Free Bond
until the half, when he tired fast, and
Courier Journal fought it out with Choral,
winning by a neck. The last heat also
went to Courier JournaJ, who led from
the start.
Masette was the favorite In the 2:10
pace, but Dumont \V won without diffi
culty.

Union Park Is to Be Operated Continuously.
Internal Dissensions at Ingleside.
MAUD'S WINS
MIDWEEK STAKE
AT UNION PARK
THE war between the Union Park and the Ingleside Coursing associa
tions is on. For two months the tacit agreement that both associa
tions should operate alternately was carried out to the letter. Now the
Union Park Association, listening to the dog owners and their petitions,
has decided to break away from the oral and understood agreement aJid
will run continuous coursing at its own park.
This determination was reached on Tuesday night at a meeting of the
directors of the Union Park Association. A petition of dog owners was pre
sented and was acted upon, with the result that the Union Park will not
operate alternately with the San Mateo Park, which . is managed by the
Ingleside Association.
How this will affect the Ingleside Association is not yet known. The
Union Park men will have coursing on Saturday and Sunday and -the mid
week reserve stake on Wednesday. It is very probable that the Ingleside
Association will hold its end of the week meetings and a midweek meeting
on Thursdays.
Since the sport has become so popular in this city dogs of high and low
degree have been flocking into local kennels. The owners are anxious to
have continuous coursing at both parks in order to work their hounds. This
s.eems the primal reason for the split between Union and Ingleside.
The board of directors of the Union Park Association declare that as the
agreement to run alternate coursins was In the nature of an experiment
merely they by no means violate any convention entered into by themselves
and the rival organization. < . ,
The Ingleside Association is suffering from internal disorders that may
disrupt It. I>ast night an informal meeting of recalcitrant stockholders rep
resenting seventy of the 300 shares met at Pythian Castle for the purpose
of fighting the $10 assessment levied by the board of directors. H. A. Deckel
man acted as chairman. . #
Another meeting will be called this evening and ; there will be present
stockholders representing one-third of the issued stock. They will then force
the president of the association. D. Shannon, to call a general meeting for
the reconsideration of the $10 assessment. Some time ago this assessment
was levied,: but as it was not met by the shareholders a sale was ordered
by the directors. It is to offset this that the meeting will be held this
evening.
Some of the shareholders who refused to pay the assessment declare 1
there was no need of it. They will fight it to the end.

Klectriclty Is the Nerve and Vital Force

is a lack of Electricity or Nerve Force
vou can never be well and strong again
until It is supplied. Nature will not. sup-
ply it for. Nature has been imposed
upon and refuses to act. My Electric
Belt supplies a strong current of Elec-
tricity that you can instantly feel and is
more than four times stronger than any
other belt. It has soft, silken, chamois-
covered sponge, water-chamber electrode3
thfl.t cannot and do not burn, blister, iry
and almost cremate me patient, as do
the bare metal electrodes used on all
other makes of belts if they give enough
current to be curative. It positively en-
dangers a person's life to have this bare
metal come in contact with the flesh, as
the chemical action of the current forms
verdigris on the bare metal discs. Verdi-
gris Is a deadly poison and may cause
blood poisoning and death. Some con-
cerns are trying to imitate my electrodes
(my exclusive patent) by covering the
bare metal discs with a thin veneering of
chamois or felt. Do not be misled. Elec-
tricity will not pass through this cover-
ing, but verdigris will.
I absolutely guarantee my Electric Belt

FRESNO. Aug. 22.â The directors of the
California Raisin Growers' ' Association

Kings and Tulare counties. He was com
municated with this evening, and replied
that he would accept the .position.
The directors, while electing Kearney's
successor as a director, have not the
power to till his place as president, and
the association will be without a chief
executive until the regular election in
April. The growers are divided into two
factionsâ Kearney and anti-Kearney.
At the mass-meeting yesterday the
Kearneyltes had 305 votes and the antf-
Kearneyites 3S5. The latter were divided
among several candidates, however, and if
an attempt had been made to elect a pres
ident Kearney would have won by a large
plurality. The nnti-Kearneyites. therefore
united on putting the election of presi
dent oft till April and letting the directors
appoint a fifth member of the board.
The directors of the association held a
protracted meeting to-night, and just be
fore midnight arranged one of the biggest
raisin deals In the history of the county.
The entire residue of last year's crop, ag
gregating over a hundred carloads, was

Thomas, and in a shower of scalding

None of the passengers were Injured-.
At the scene of the wreck, the track
was blocked by the twisted car standing

The only way to keep the day free from holiday
sports is that which has now been proposed. A Sun
day celebration would not be a holiday in the ordi
nary sense of the word. It remains to be seen, how
ever, -whether the public would consent to the change.
When a people have grown up in the custom of cele
brating a pnrticular day. it is not easy to induce th?m
to abandon it. Should the Grand Army adopt the
resolution suggested snd hold their services on Sun
day it is probable the general public would still insist
cn its own holiday and celebrate it without the aid of
the veterans. It is certainly an interesting issue and
one that will be followed with no little attention
throughout the country.
That some such movement should be started is not
unnatural. It has been noted for some~"time past
that many earnest persons have been dissatisfied with
the way in which Memorial day has come to be cele
brated by the general mass of the people. There
have been criticisms time and again upon the toler
ance of sports, games, picnics and other forms of
frolicking on that day. Of course, such criticisms
could not affect the conduct of those criticised. When
a day has been set apart as a holiday, it is not within
the scope of our Government nor within the power
cf public sentiment to force a man to celebrate it in
any other way than he chooses. The day happens to
come at a season of the year when throughout all
the Northern States every one delights in getting out
into the woods and ric'.ds and to indulge in open air
games. Consequently it was inevitable that the popu
lar form of celebrating the day should depart more
and more from that which was designed by* the
founders of it.
!~\ CCORDING to a report from the East, a
/ \ movement will be made at the Grand Army
* encampment at Chicago next week to change
the date of the annual memorial observance from May
30 to the last Sunday in May. The object of the pro
posed movement is to get rid of the tendency to
make the day a general holiday and preserve for it
the solemn and sacred character of a day set apart for
the memory of the patriotic dead.
MEMORIAL D0Y OBSERVANCE,
It can hardly be necessary to point out to the Re
publicans of the Eleventh District what they must
do under such circumstances to maintain the honor of
their district and their party. It matters not who is
running against him, Mr. Belshaw should be elected;
The Call has accurate information from reliable
sources that these threats against business men sup
porting Mr. Belshaw have been made by representa
tives of the railroad. Should occasion require it, the
names will be published. There is no doubt about
the matter. The Southern Pacific Company in its
malignant hatred of Mr. Belshaw is now attempting
to defeat him by threatening injury to the business
interests of those who support him.
Men who have business relations with the South
ern Pacific and whose business affairs can be seri
ously injured by the railroad have been thus notified
that they must expect to bear the consequences of the
displeasure of the Southern Pacific Company if they
support Mr. Belshaw for the State Senate.
The Call has information that men who are
supporting Mr. Belshaw have been told by represen
tatives of the Southern Pacific Company that such
action is regarded by the railwaj' officials as an act
of hostility to the railroad, and they have been warned
that it will be to their detriment if they continue.
DURING the regular and the extra session of
the . Legislature, when the Southern Pacific
Company, aided by certain disreputable bosses
in San Francisco, was endeavoring to procure the
election of Burns to the United States Senate, no
Republican stood more faithfully and firmly by the
honor of the party .md the welfare of the State than
C. M. Belshaw, at that time a member of the Assem
bly. The Southern Pacific Company noted the zeal
with which he combated the railroad schemes and
put him upon the political blacklist â marked him as
one whom the railroad and its tools would oppose
from that time on.
Mr. Belshaw is now a candidate for the Republican
nomination for the Senate in the Eleventh District.
The railroad has set all its bosses and its push at work
to defeat him. The tactics employed by the company
in the fight are unscrupulous, and there is no limit
put upon the means or the methods which it makes
use of in the effort to defeat this honest representative
of the people and of true Republicanism.
THE FIGHT AGAINST BELSrjflW.
SUIT FOR LITTLE BOY.
The suit represented in the Illustration
is made of thin light beige covert cloth,
with collar and chemisette of white ba
tiste trimmed with pleats of the same ma
terial. The belt is of yellow leather. The
chemisette Is made with sleeves so that
it can be worn without tho jacket. ".
j Before the Oakland Superinteadent writes "idiot" op
j positethe names of such children, we advise his Board
j cf Directors to completely equip their Central Gram
j mar School manual department, for it needs it, and
j give to these children the opportunity to combine head
I and hand in smithing, carpentry, mechanical drawing,
I cooking, weaving, tailoring and other manual opera
\ tions. "- We are sure that the. results will be gratifying.
j If it were our case we would rather take the revenues
i that now go to support one entire ward school in thnt
; city and devote them to a plant for manual training,
j than wring the heart of a single-parent by condemn
j ing a child as a cretin.
The hectic and artificial conditions which idealists
have forced into the schools are not producing re
sults which the people have a right to expect. When
manual training schools, fully equipped, have been
made a part of public school systems, results unfore
seen and very satisfactory have followed. It has been
found that a very large majority of children consid
ered dull and defective in their classes, indifferent and
insubordinate, have found their proper place in the
manual school, where they evince the greatest
interest, make the most satisfactory progress, drop
their dullness and indifference, and are finally led into
a full and useful education through the use of mind
and hand together.
Many fail to keep that pace for physical reasons,
not related to brain-cell development at all. There
are many peculiar defects .of vision which handicap
children and make them seem dull. , When these de
fects are remedied by the oculist and optician there is
no further complaint of the child's capacity. It is the
opinion of many sound educators that the common
school curriculum is, overloaded and that the system
is keyed up to the maximum precocity of children,
instead of being adjusted to the average. All chil
dren are not equal in 'development and observation
confirms the conclusion that those who" develop late
are usually the most reliable and have the^best staying
qualities in after life.
SLOW CHILDREN.
THE Superintendent of the Oakland schools fa
vors the exclusion from the classes of children
who don't keep up, on the theory that they are
mentally deficient. It may be true that there are a
few children who, by atrophy of the thyroid gland,
are suffering from deficient cerebral nutrition. But
it is probably truer that the pace set in the public
schools is too fast for the average child.

all sides. Finding himself reflected in
every direction, he said that he "supposed
he was at a meeting of the clerjry. and
there seemed to be a very respectable at
tendance."
The Republicans of the Forty-first are warned to
be on guard against the trick. Dibble should
not be permitted to profit in the least by such cunning
as that. Let the word be passed along among the
Tank and file. The man who is trying, this trick in
the primaries would be equally tricky in the Legisla
ture.
It is hardly necessary to point out that the members
of the State Committee and of the National Com
mittee should not be candidates for election in this
contest. Should any disputes arise over the results,
the determination of them would doubtless be carried
to the State Committee and therefore the members of
that body should hold themselves strictly impartial.
That will appear so plain to intelligent and fair
niir.ded men that it requires no argument
It will be seen that the trick consists in putting up
prominent members of the national and State com
mittees for the purpose of adding strength to his local
ticket. It is his expectation that voters for the one
will also vote for the other and that he will thereby
win out despite popular objection to him.
In designing the trick he has taken advantage of
the fact that there are to be elected to-morrow dele
gates to the State convention as well as delegates to
the legislative and judicial convention. In the State
convention Dibble has little or no interest. His fight
is to obtain the election of Dibble delegates to the
local convention so as to get for himself the nomina
tion for Assemblyman. To achieve that he has placed
at the head of his ticket a State convention ticket,
containing the names of \Y. C. Van Fleet of the Re
publican National Committee; George Stone, chair
man of the State Central Committee, and J. B. Dut
tcn and Wakefield Baker, members of the executive
committ'c of the State Committee. m ~'
and that his ticket if left to itself would be ut
terly defeated at the primaries to-morrow, Dibble
has sought to save himself by a^Hck which is about
as cunning and as unscrupulous as any ever played in
California politics.

of the books necessary in one county are

"That the committee hereby insists that a free and
untrammeled ballot and an honest count must be en
forced at said primary election; that all attempts to
deviate from this principle should be discountenanced,
and that those guilty of frauds or parties thereto
should be debarred from all conventions, and that if
it shall appear at any polling place that there is or
has been any fraud or wrong committed, or the right
of any citizen to cast his free and untrammeled ballot
and to have the same honestly counted has been in
any way interfered- with, the committee in charge
shall set aside and declare null and void the election
at said polling place and report their action to the dif
ferent conventions, who shall take action in such
matter and decide which set of delegates is entitled to
a seat in the convention."
The fairness which is to characterize the primaries
gives encouragement to honest Republicans to go to
the polls. Their votes will not be overcome by
Mint Saloon stuffers nor thrown out by the unscru
pulous agents of the Southern Pacific Railroad.
Every honest vote will be honestly counted and con
sequently the bosses will be utterly defeated if good
Republicans attend to their political duties â go to the
polls and vote right.
In this connection it is pertinent to remind all Re
publicans who have not yet registered of the import
ance of attending to it at once. ' Later on there is
sure to be a great rush at the registration office and
there will then be more or less inconvenience in at
tending to the duty. The primaries take place to
morrow. Why not register to-day?
SAN FRANCISCO Republicans are now face to
face with the issue' of honest against dishonest
politics as involved in the primary elections
which are to take place to-morrow. The County
Committee has. stood firmly for genuine Republican
ism, despite all that Herrin, Crimmins and Kelly
could do to dominate it. Therefore the regular ticket
which will be put forth in each district will represent
the better elements of the party and a firm opposition
to the bosses.
The issue having now been joined, it is for the rank
and file of the. party to determine the contest. The
bosses are going to make a hard fight to win. They
will make use of every resource at their command.
They will have the support of all the rounders of the
saloons and of all the railroad push that is controlled
by Herrin. Therefore it is no easy victory that awaits
the upholders of honest politics. Not a single vote
can be spared. The energy and the persistency of the
bosses must be met by an equal energy and persever
ance on the part of those who stand for genuine Re
publicanism.
The voting is to be fairly done and fairly counted.
In the call for the primary it is stated: -'

We have avoided overstatement of the situation.
There it is. Those who vote for him vote for what
they want, if they want such a revolution. Those
who vote for him, not wanting such a revolution, but
because he is honest, will get it anyway, if their esti
mate of him is correct.
This is the programme to .which Colonel Bryan's
acceptance of the Populist nomination commits him.
If he is honest, sincere and faithful he is so much
more dangerous.
His power will be used to upset our financial sys
tem, destroy the gold standard, effect the free coinage
of silver at an artificial ratio and return to the issue
of greenbacks. The volume of that issue will, under
direct legislation, be determined by popular vote and
the fallacies held by the advocates of "a more and a
fittener currency" will riot without check or hind
rance.
Much is said about the honesty and sincerity and
fidelity of Colonel Biyan. About this opinions dif
fer, but admitting that ascription of these qualities to
him is correct, if he is elected President the power
of his office will be used to effect this startling revo
lution in our Government. It will be used to replace
our constitutional system by all the vagaries of the
French revolution, edged with the theories of
Nicholas Bakounin and the leaders of anarchy and
nihilism.
As to the extvnai policies of this government,
their errors are subject to correction by wholesome
reaction in public sentiment. But to what* quarter
shall we look for escape from the evils which lie in
such a revolution of our home government as this
platform proposes? When representative govern
ment is once destroyed, when the courts and legis
latures and Congress are once abolished, when legis
lation and adjudication are given- over to the ballot
box and our judicial system is stricken down, there
comes a chaos from which escape lies only in the
man on horseback, and a condition to which Colon 21
Bryan's picture of imperialism is as mild as the por
trait of a pretty maid milking her cow compared to
the presence of a hungry Bengal tiger.
It will be observed that this Bryanic revolution de
stroA-s the doctrine of inalienable rights, written into
the Declaration of Independence by Mr. Jefferson.
It puts every man's rights of person and property
into politics, to be buffeted at the polls and taken
away at the will of a majority that is not under any
obligation to be "reasonable," which Jefferson said
was the sole standard of right in the rule of the
majority.
It will be seen, then, that when Colonel Bryan ac
cepts this nomination arid platform, he declares for an
entirely new system of government, foreign to our
present constitution and subversive of the principles
of that instrument. Raising the cry of imperialism,
he accuses the Republicans of intending to change
the government, while accepting and himself advo
cating a change more positive and revolutionary than
that which he pretends to see in the policy of his op
ponents. It is a settled principle in the science of
government that when the objects of governmental
jurisdiction are increased the efficiency of govern
ment is decreased. It is a sound maxim that the
government is best which governs least. But here is
Colonel Bryan advocating the abolition of private
ownership of land, of transportation, of the instru
ments of commerce, the transfer of the veto to the
ballot box, the destruction of representative govern
ment, the abolition of the courts and of all processes
for the rationalizing of government and the intro
duction of wholesale communism, which must result
in the final coming of chaos and anarchy.
The platform, which he accepts with the nomina
tion, declares for public ownership of all land; for an
unlimited issue of greenbacks; for government
ownership and operation of all railroads; for the free
coinage of silver at the ratio of 16 to I ; for the aboli
tion of private ownership of the instruments of com
merce, and, to secure all these innovations,, for direct
legislation by the initiative and referendum, relocat
ing the veto power and giving it to the people.
In his speech on assuming the- presidency of the
Populist Convention. Mr. Patterson of Colorado
said: "In 1896 we did not nominate Mr. Bryan to
please the Democrats. We cared not what their will
or pleasure was. The People's party, standing on its
platform, would have been untrue to itself, untrue to
its principles, had it nominated any other man."
/"*â¢ OLONEL BRYAN will this week accept the
I Populist nomination. It was given to him at
Sioux Falls several months ago, and he has
had ample time to digest the platform. He will now
assure its makers of its assimilation and will declare
that it has become a part of his political flesh and
bone.

PERSONAL MENTION.
The issue is up to the Republicans of the Eleventh
District. They can send to the State Senate ~a. man
whom the people can count on, or they can surrender
to the Southern Pacific. The p6\ver of the corpora
tion is great, and there is no question but what the
threat uttered against the business men who support
Belshaw is one of grave portent. Nevertheless, the
Southern Pacific is not all powerful. It was beaten
by Belshaw and nfen like him in.the.Legislature. first
z\ the regular session and afterward at the extra ses
sion. It can be beaten again. The Republicans of
the Eleventh District can beat it, and if they are
worthy of their party and of the manhood of Cali
fornia they will.
He is known to be true and trustworthy. It is cer
tain the Southern Pacific cannot use him to dishonor
the party and wrong the people. It is sure that he
can neither be coaxed nor bulldozed into dishonest
paths. Such a man merits election. He has by his
fidelity and firmness won the right to ask the indorse
ment of his fellow citizens, and it should be given
him by an overwhelming majority.

Merchants' Association Granted Per
mission to Inaugurate an
1 Innovation.
The Board of Public Works granted per
mission yesterday to the Merchants' As
sociation, which petitioned for the privi
lege to inaugurate a series of experiments
in a new system of signs containing the
names of the streets. The innovation
contemplates the abolition of the board
signs. which have been hitherto attached
on corner buildings 'and the placing of
large-lettered signs near the curblngs on
the four corners of cross streets. For
that purpose the artificial stone sidewalk
will be cut out for a distance of one foot
and large wooden letters designating the
names of the streets will be placed in
fresh concrete. After drying, the wooden
letters v.-ill be removed and black or col
ored cement substituted.
The plan will be tried at the corner of
Post and Kearny streets, and if it meets
with favor from the public will be ex
tended throughout the city. The first ex
periments will be made at the expense of
the Merchants' Association, which de
sires to remove the unsightly signs that
disfigure many of the houses.

1 Whiles " few impressive examples of
true Gothic art may be found scattered
throughout Italy, it was never entirely
naturalized there. For this reason the
return to classic models brought about by
the renaissance was especially acceptable
to the Italian taste. Thenceforth wood
can-ings of battle scenes, triumphal
marches, allegoric representations of the
virtues, seasons and elements, and es
peclallv scenes from classical mythology,
replaced the more austere medieval rep
resentations of sacred subjects or the he

Fireplaces, which until the end or the
fifteenth century had been made of stone,
were thenceforth richly carved in oak.
In England and neighboring countries the
oak has been the standard of strength,
toughness and durability, notwithstand
ing the fact that its cross grain makes its
management difficult where nicety of de
tail is especially desirable. In Italy wal
nut, desnlte its brittleness. has always
been the favorite, and has been used most
effectively in elegantly carved "cassone
fronts, panels, choir stalls and furniture.
Oftentimes it was picked out with gilt
or color, and occasionally decorated with
wooden mosiac or ivory inlay. The ex

showed to such advantage upon the ornate

. Since then good woodwork haa been the

specimens have been produced in the

conspicuous as the oases in an artistic

President A. W. Foster of the California
Northwestern said yesterday, however,
that an extension to Eureka was a matter
that positively could not be considered
now. The company's charter will not per
mit the construction of more than sixty
more miles of track in Mendocino County.
"Our purpose in building," he said, "is
largely to reach the timber districts. The
question of freight will figure very promi
nently in determining the starting point
for the extension. The passenger traffic
is a secondary consideration."
A single track will be constructed and
the cost of building the road will be large
owing to the mountainous region it will
traverse. A good deal of blasting will
have to be done and there will have to
be several tunnels constructed.
Three different routes have been sur
veyed. One begins at Cloverdale and ex
tends west into the Coast Range for sixty
miles. A second route is west from Hop
land, and a third is north from Uklali.
"Whic&h of these three routes is the most
feasible is a matter that the company ia
now trying to determine. Much will de
pend upon the report of the surveyors.
It is understood that the people of Ukiah
are making a strong fight to have the
road start from that place, which Is now
the terminus of the so-called "Picturesque
route of California." It has long been the
dream of the Ukiah property owners that
some day the company would build to
Eureka, which is ISO miles north of
Ukiah, and they figure that .if another
line is once started frOm the town it will
mean ultimately a through route to Eu
reka.

During medieval times the style of ar
chitecture known as Gothic â a term first
used in reproach and signifying barbarlo
grew into favor and beautified the finest
buildings of France, England and Ger
rhany. The pointed arch, vertical panel
ing, crocketed spires and foliated decora
tion characteristic of this noblest style of
architecture also largely influenced the
interior furnishings, as shown in the mag
nificent choir stalls, pulpits and other
equipments of cathedral and castle. It Is
quite probable that the architect who
planned the monasteries and cathedrals
Among barbarous nations wood carving
as a subordinate form of sculpture showed
itself in crude cuttings upon clubs and
primitive weapons of warfare. Many of
the most famous statues or antiquity were
made of wood, sometimes carved with a
rude, bold skill, sometimes overlaid with
gold or ivory or painted and decked out
with highly colored robes.
"A curious nr.ticle of furniture, indispen
sable to the Roman library, was the scrln
lum or scroll bookcase. As the volumes
of those days v.ere rolls of parchment the
bookcases wera circular and box-shaped.
These beechen-wood boxes could bo locked
or sealed and were easily portable when
the owner wished to carry his library on
his Journeys.
Among the northern nations may be
found excellent specimens of carved lin
tels dating from the early Viking times.
This wooden sculpturing, although rough,
is nevertheless characterized by a sin
gular freedom of outline, together with a
fondness for the distorted as a decorative
motive and an elaboration of the gro
tesque to the structurr' and ornamental
part of furnishings, as shown in the Nor
wegian doorway and the Scandinavian
chair of the early middle ages.
The successful manipulation of the va
rious woods may truly be classed among
the antediluvian arts, for the Instructions
given to Noah for making a waterproof
ark are such as would have been given
only to a workman of experience. The
same, to an even greater degree, may be
said of the directions for building the
tabernacle and the temple. Owing to the
perishable nature of wood, with the excep
tion of a few specimens preserved in the
dry Egyptian climate, no remains of the
primal woodwork mentioned by Homer
and the early Hebrew writers are now in
existence. We judge, however, from an
cient vase painting, tomb and wall pict
ures, sculpture and embroidery, that the
general plan of using animals, slaves and
sphinxes for support was followed In
woodwork as In the ancient metal tables,
chairs and couches now preserved in mu
seums. Homer mentions a most interest
ing historic wooden chest, seen and identi
fied 800 years afterward by Pausanias.
This cedar chest, carved and gilt and dec-
Orated with bas-reliefs in gold and ivory,
was once the hiding place of Oypselus of
Corinth. His relatives, having been
warned by the oracle of Delphi that the
child would one day assume the reins of
government, sought his life, but owing to.
his concealment in the famous chest he
lived to fulfill the Delphic prophecy and
to reign over Corinth thirty years â 655 to
"625 B. C.

.and -tables, giving them that overcrowded
effect which is such a defect la our mod

Italian grace was eventually grafted
upon the vigor, dexterity and fantasy of
the Flemi/igs, and so closely allied with,
contemporary English carving that Flem
ish and English woodwork were frequent
ly Indistinguishable. The Germans, too.
showe-l themselves thoroughly to have
, mastered the renaissance wood carving,
both on a gigantic and a minute scale.
This intermingling of German, Flemish
and Italian styles with the Anglican
Gothic distinguishes the woodwork of the
English renaissance from that of Franca
and Italy. Interlacing strap work, so
prevalent In Elizabethan and Jacobean
ornament, was of Flemish origin. Styles
of design so frequently overlapped each
other during the renaissance that It 13
sometimes difficult to approximate the
date of Important pieces of carving.
Gothic designs were used as late aa thÂ«
sixteenth century, and their architectonic
characteristics were especially noticeable
In wooden paneling. At first paneling 1
was employed in the crude carpentry of
the early Gothic chests, but came Into
almost g-eneral use for English rooms In
the early part of , the thirteenth century.
Pir.e was soon supplanted by the more
substantial oak. which was decorated
with elaborate tracery, a most popular
design being a carved facsimile of a fold
ed textile known as the "linen scroll pat
tern." The roof and choir stalls of the
chapel of Henry VII in Westminster Ab
bey are world-famous for their carved en
richments, showing the admixture of
Gothic perpendicularity with the new
Italian style.
' Many fine examples of the carved
screens, fireplaces and wall panellngs of
this period are still preserved in England.
1 An excellent example of Elizabethan
, woodwork is the oak screen or partition
of Gray's Inn, the carved screen sup
porting the minstrels' gallery bein& espe
cially noteworthy. Those who make a
study of the old wainseotlnga, richly
carved without overcrowding, cannot but
regret that so dignified and soothing a
background should have been banished
from modern furnishing. Without the
illusory suggestiveness of tapestry it hail
nevertheless a repose and harmonizing
quality which none of our modern wall
1 treatments even approximate. As a rule
the old English paneling was especially
designed for the house in which it was
placed. In cases where the panels were
elaborately carved tt Is supposed that
they were bought separately and placed
in plain framework moldings by the local
carpenter or by the "Joiner" attached to
every noble household. Oftentimes the
paneling did not cover the entire wall
space, large wall paintings or a succes
sion of pictures separated by battens
breaking up the wooden monotony. In
time separate pictures, like mirrors, were
placed in separate frames. Holbein's
paintings for Henry VIII being the first
pictures framed In England.
The austere genius of Inlgo Jones
was especially influential in patterns for
woodwork fittings. A diligent study of the
classic designs in Rome stimulated his en
thusiasm and chastened his taste. In
England there is still preserved this orig
inal foot note to some of his famous work
ing plans: "In the name of God; Amen.

The mall steamer Australia got away
for Honolulu yesterday with an unusually
big passenger list and nearly 2000 tons of
freight. Those who went away in the
cabin are:
The Australia Sails.
The work of transferring the cable for
the St. Michael-Cape Nome telograph line
from the railroad cars to the steamer
Orizaba was bepun at Long Wharf, Oak
land, yesterday. The steamer docked
there early In the day and at 1 p. m. the
work of putting the different reels aboard
began.
The cable Is 1S7 miles long and is loaded
on twelve cars. On each car there is a
reel weighing fifteen tons. Ten of these
cars are now on JL^ng Wharf. The cable
on each reel is ten miles long, so the worK
of moving them from the wharf to the
hold of the vessel is somewhat protracted.
A strong pillar has been erected in tne
hold of the steamer and around this tne
cable is being colled. As each ten miles
is run out a splice is put in. so that when
it comes to laying the telegraph wire it
will run out for its full 1S7 miles without
a hitch. The cable will be laid on triang
ular lines. The iirst leg will be from M.
Miohar-l to Unalaklik, the second from
Unalaklik to Cai>e Nome and the third
from Cape Nome to the starting point.
The work will probably take a week,
and then a start for St. Michael will be
made.
One Hundred and Eighty-Seven Miles
of It Is Being Reeled Into
the Hold of the
Steamer.

The wool market has shown more activity
the past week, although the business reported
has been in spots, not being at all well dis

doing while a few others report some good
sized sales, which swell the volume of tran
sactions for the week under review to about
3 500 000 pounds. Last year, at this time, the
weekly sales were close to 5,000,000 pounds.
Some fair sized lines of Territory and. Texas

NEW YORK. Aug. 22.â The level of prices I '
wan not materially changed as a result of to- | ]
day's trading in stocks. In fact the. fluetua- ! !

exceed *Â» per cent and in only a few special- j ;
ties was thÂ» range a point. Conditions under- <J
lying the general situation are the main topic j <
of discussion on the street and it apparently I !
required unusual developments to extricate the |
market from the rut In which It has fallen. Â¦
With operations pretty generally limited to
the trading element who close their contracts j
from day to day not much importance can be
attached to current market movements. Some I .
effort way made at the opening to continue j
yesterday's late reaction, but supporting; orders j
appeared in Brooklyn Transit and People's V
Gas, which strengthened the entire list. Con- 1
solldated Gas was in extreme demand and rose j
alir.uFi two points on buying Inspired by its I
early restoration to an S per cent annual divl- i r
(lend basis. A subsequent attack was made
on People's Gas. th* price going down 1V4 and I
remaining under last night until the final deal

count for the recent pronounced pressure < *
against this stock. Business was at a stand- ] Â¦"
still during the greater part of the afternoon, I *
but toward the close there was a slight spurt
and prices- rose to the best figures of the <3a>

OAKLAND, Aug. 22.â There were
three rlfta In the monotony which
threatened to overwhelm the Re
publican convention of the Third
Congressional District In Oakland to-day.
The first was the Mare Island band, which
was brought down by the Solano County
delegation. The second was W. H. Chick
ering's clever nominating speech, and the
third was Victor H. Metcalf's graceful ac
ceptance.
The convention was purely a ratlflcatlon
of the expressed will of the people.
When the Solano County delegation
made its appearance, headed by State
Senator J. J. Luchsinger and the Marine
Band from the receiving ship Indepen
dence, a great sigh of relief went up from
? he delegates. The band was a good one,
and it played all morning and all after
noon, and after the convention was over
It went up and serenaded Congressman
Metcalf. The member% of the Solano
County delegation showed the most en
thusiasm of the convention, and made
their appearance with gorgeous yellow
badges, and did everything possible to
make the convention a success. It was
more like a home delegation than a visit
ing one.
W. H. Chickerlng*8 nominating speech
was the most remarkable one ever deliv
ered in the State for Its extreme brevity.
Its graceful compliment to the gentleman
nominated, and its little reference, to the
defeated candidate. ,
There were seconding speeches by Ar
thur W. North of Yolo County. J. L.
Geary of Contra Costa County, who said
that Contra Costa was always loyal and
never got anything, and R. H. Collins of
Oakland. . .
The nomination was made by acclama
tion and a committee of three, composed
of Dr. II. N. Rowell of Berkeley, J. L.
Geary of Contra Costa and H. Hathaway

DEMOCRATIC CLUB SPLITS.
Voters of the Thirty-Fifth Resent
Action of Phelan Managers.
Thomas E. Curran, one of Phelan's fol
lowers, and Stephen Byrne, who has the
voters of the district behind him, wish
to go to the State Senate from the Nine
teenth District. At the meeting last night
of the Bryan and Stevenson Club of the
Thirty-fifth Assembly District. Chairman
E. J. Stafford, who favors Curran, de
clined to permit the club to proceed with
the nomination of delegates for the State
convention, on the alleged ground that
William Bell, one of the members, was
not a Democrat. Stafford adjourned the
meeting until to-night, when the names
of Curran's candidates will be announced
from the top window of his residence at
2S22 Mission street.
Immediately after Stafford adjourned
the meeting he skipped out of the hall fol
lowed by his few friends. Cell and his
followers, who represent tho better ele
ment of the Democratic party, then opened
the meeting by placing Captain \V. May
in the chair. They nominated the follow
ing named gentlemen for delegates: Frank
O'Byrne, S. Petterson, Alphonsus Pottet.
James H. Robertson, Joseph Leggett and
Joseph II. Donlan.
Three rousing cheers for the success of
the Democratic ticket, in so far aa Bryan
and Stevenson are concerned, were given
with a wllL Mr. Phelan and his City Hall
following were not included.
Sub-Committee's Report Adopted.
The meeting of the Fourth Congress
ional District committee last night in the
Parrott Building resulted In the adoption,
of the report submitted by the sub-com
mittee appointed at the last meeting. The
sub-committee, composed of P. H. Prend
ergast, A. Barnard, Dr. P. A. Kearny
and A. Ruef, reported that they were
satisfied with the delegates named, anil
that the call for the election In thet
opinion wan satisfactory.
DifiDle s Ruse m
the Forty-first
Assembly Dis
trictâMartin
Kellu's Latest
StroKe.
Besort to New Tactics.
YESTERDAY was a busy day at
the headquarters of the Republi
can County Commltte.> in the
Baldwin annex. The henchmen of
Kelly and Crimmins who caused
purh an uproar at Bhielfl Hall night before
lr.st recognized early yesterday morning
that the anti-bors forces were in posses
sion of the works and could not be dis
lodged. The kickers, after advising with
their leaders, decided to file their tickets
and comply with the provisions of the call
for the primary election, as officially pub
lished In this Journal.
Several of the dissatisfied aired their
FTievanees at the State Central Commit
tee headquarters in the Palace Hotel, but
they received slight encouragement In that
*iuarter. Ab all the facts come to lipht it
transpires that the bosses were outgen
eraled as well as outnumbered. The pro
vision relating to a returning board is
contained In the original draft of the pri
mary plan, which Max Goldberg present
ed and which was drawn by Kelly and
J'rcndergast. The provision was not dis
turbed when the pten was amended by
rtriking out the "fifty-four" clause. The
clause did not appear, however, in a
pynopsis of the adopted plan as published
in one of the city papers. Hence the Kel
ly lobsters at the meeting Tuesday night
proceeded on the supposition that the re
turning board was an addition to the pian.
They never thought of amending the plan
before its ofikial publication. While they
were wrangling Ruet' had the point In re
serve to rinish the kickers if. they did not
linisn themselves.
K*Â»llv and Crimmins have now resorted
to other tactic- to disrupt the Republican
party. Last nigbt they put through the
plan* to nominate candidates for the
legislature by the Fourth Congressional
District Convention. They will have an
r.ld style Kelly and Crimmins primary
r^xt Saturday. Then the bosses can
Ftuff the ballot boxes at their pleasure,
as they will have all the eU-ction officers
Infide and no opposition outside. There is
no candidate in the .Republican
party opposing the nomination of
Julius Kahn for Congress. The
separate convention axid separate pri
maries were culled to prepetuate Kelly
and Crimmins' control of the Congres
sional Committee.
The Republicans of the Forty-third As-
Fembly District, who will vote at the poll
ing place, 302 Masnn street, to-morrow,
should be on thr-ir guard apainst the per
petration of fraud. The polling place for
nine of the precincts has been established
in that Quarter of the district ami the
bosses are already preparing for fraudu
lent work.
Republicans of the Forty-flm Assembly
District who despise bossism and have no
use for the creatures of a boss should not
make the mistake of supposing that they j
have an ra?y walk-ovrr in the riph'. i
against Dibble, lie is a tricky and cun- '
r.ing politician, full of expedients and de- '
vices to deceive unwary voters. In order
to catch a few votes he would not hesitate
to place the sign anti-bops and anti-Dib
ble at the head <-,f his own ticket. lie has J
already resorted to the trick of placing ;
the names of well-known Republican citi- Â¦
zen? on the State dekcrate ticket. Among |
the names so enrolled is that of Judfje Van
Fleet, member of the Republican National !
Committee. The name of George Stone, i
chairman of the Republican State Com- !
mittro. Is also on the Dibble ticket fcr j
delegate to the Santa Cruz convention. I
An unwary citizen, hastily scanning th.> !
names, might faaev that the ticket reprc- j
pented the Republican organization. Fur- !
ther 5crutiny. however, will discing tho !
fact that Dibble delegate! to the local con- '
vention follow. Dibble's purpose i ? to ufÂ°
the namf? of Van Fleet and other wr \\'
known citizens on the S'ate list to pull
through his own crowd for the Legisla
tive and judiciaJ convention.
Not Important.
The election of delegates to the Santa
Cruz convention Is not of vital Impor
tance. There is nothing for the conven
tion to do but to place in the field nine
Presidential electors, but the bosses are
very anxious indeed to pull through a
local delegation that will renominate Dib
ble for the Assembly.
It is hardly reop^sarv to remfrid the
residents of the Forty-first. District that
they were never represented in thÂ» Legis
lature when Dibble wÂ«h thr-ro. He was
the agent of boodle. He did not consult
the people of the district. He wr-nt to
Herrin for orders. He was the bell
â¢weather of the corrupt band, and all the
boodJers followed his lead. Representa
tives from the interior wondered how it
happened that the Forty-first District
elected Dibble to the Legislature. It hap
pened because the prosperous and easy
going Republicans of the district paid no
attention to the primaries, but nn the con
trary, stayed nt homo while Lanlgan.
Rainey, Kelly and Crimmins drummed up
the puph to elect drlegates. Tt will hap
pen again if the cU-an and decent Repub
licans are not on the nlert. Th" bnpsps are
already planning for work in that
district at the primary election to-mor
row.
Stenp should be taken to place a genuine
anti-Dibble anti-boss and anti-waste
basket ticket in the hand? of every voter
rf the district. The tlckpts should b* so
placed to-day or to-night in order to elude
devices and tricks to-morrow.
Tickets Are Filed.
Tickets selected in the various Assem
bly districts to be voted i:nin at the pri
mary to-morrow were fileii with the

day by W. R. H. Adamson, executor of
the will : of the late Adolph Sutro, for
leave to sell the library. His application
Is sanctioned by a majority of the heirs.
Following the filing of this document,
Mrs. Merritt filed an opposition to Adam
son's petition, in which she set forth that
the library was hers by virtue of para
graph 23 of her deceased father's will. In
which he said: "I bequeath to my daugh

all of my books, papers, scrapbooks, man

Europe with her father when he pur
chased many volumes for his library.
Other witnesses were called/but very. few
facts ofinterest developed. On behalf of
the heirs who wish to sell the library,
Attorney Wheeler cf the firm of Bishop
& AVheeler contended that the decedent
did not intend to convey to Mrs. Merritt
his large library,' but .-. devised her the
books and other effects ; in the private
library in his home. The entire question
rests on Â¦ the - construction of the . clause

that point will be heard by the court.

REAX, ESTATE TRANSACTIONS,
Mrs. Brooks made no declaration of du
tiablfe effects, and when Inspectors Camp
bell and Sackett searched her trunk they
found done -up In- one of her skirts some
dutiable articles of embroidered goods.
She was then turned over to Mrs. S. E.
Adams, customs inspectress, taken into a
private room and searched. Mrs. Adams
found upon her person two embroidered
dresses of Chinese silk. Mrs. Brooks was
very, much agitated, and explained that
she had- put on the dresses for comfort
and that she cculd claim them as part of
her personal apparel, but the inspectress
was of the opinion that Mrs. Brooks had
a sufficient quantity of skirts on for com
fort.- and that she would have to pay duty
on the embroidered dresses. She was ac
cordingly obliged to pay $26 before she
was allowed to take her baggage. The
customs officials forbore arresting her or
seizing and confiscating the dresses, and
they were dumfounded when she said that
the fur tippets were missing after the
search by the customs officers. On the
other hand, the officers denied that the
tippets were there, and as the trunks were
searched in the presence of witnesses and
nothing was taken from them her story
was not believed.
Inspectress Adams says that Mrs.
Brooks in her agitation and embarrass
ment offered her one of the embroidered
dresses and requested her to say nothing
about the discovery.
Mrs. Mildred B. Brooks has a grievance
against the Custom-house way of treating
her when she arrived here on the Govern
ment transport Sherman on August 6,
and she has made complaint to the Secre
tary of the Treasury, charging the cus
toms authorities with having subjected
her to the Indignity of a search of her
person at the hands of Inspectors, and
hinting that some one connected with the
service is responsible for the disappear
ance of two fur tippets of great value
that were among her effects.
Mrs, Brooks while on the voyage across
the Pacific from the Orient expressed her
self in uncomplimentary terms concerning
certain officers of the transport, and upon
her arrival here they Informed the cus
toms authorities that It was their belief
that Mrs. Brooks intended to smuggle a
quantity of silks and other dutiable goods
ashore.
She Hints That Two Fur Tippets
Were Stolen While She Was
Being Searched for
Smuggled Goods.
Accuses Customs Officials
of Grave Discourtesy
Toward Her.

Two Events Before the Columbia
Athletic Club Promise Good
Fistic Sport. .
The Columbia Athletic Club will furnish
a middle and a light weight fight this
evening at Woodward's Pavilion. Both
contests will be .twenty-round affairs.
The principal event of the evening, be
tween Jim Trimble and Tim Murphy,
promises to be a merry go. Murphy hab
been tried on several occasions and Is
considered a man - of ability with the
gloves. Trimble is practically new to the
business, but the few ring performances
he has figured In show him to be a prom
ising lad. Under the guidance of Tim
McGrath he has Improved daily In . his
work.
Murphy is the favorite over Trimble at
odds of 2 to 1. The betting public seems
to have taken his, greater experience Into
consideration and placed odds : on this
basis. Trimble is a strong, healthy lad,
who handles himself in good style. What
he is worth in actual combat will be seen
to-night when, he mixes, with; Murphy.
The preliminary' bout will bring Tommy
Cox and Toby Irwin together. Cox put up
a splendid performance against Cole last
month and is fancied on that account by
the local sporting fraternity. He is the
favorite over Irwin at odds of 10 to 7.
From the training quarters of ; all four
men come reports of firm, fit condition.

Board of Police Commissioners, by being
recognized as a lieutenant or being rein
stated in that rank. This course lies open
to the present board by reason of the
opinion rendered by City and County At
torney Franklin K. Lane.
This opinion, if considered by the Com
missioners, will result in Justice, being
done an efficient and unoffending officer.
William Price has for the past twenty
years performed honorable service in the
Police Department and his record as an
oflicer is one of the best In the service.
Although advanced in age he is active and
by his application to the Commissioners
he shows he is still anxious to perform
police duty.
The opinion rendered by the City and
County Attorney paves the way for
Price's reinstatement. Mr. Lane holds
that the old board had no power to dis
rate an officer. This being the law, it fol
lows that Price should never have been
reduced in rank. That the present Com
missioners are anxious to do Justice to the
lieutenant was evidenced by the inquiries
they put to City and County Attorney
Lane.
Mr. Lane stated last night that his opin
ion was one of abstract law and not in
volving the personal status of any par
ticular person on the force or of any In
dividual, v

Harry E. Corbett, William Daly an.i
Walter Mclnerney. who were convicted
by Judge Mogan last Saturday of violat

peared for sentence yesterday morning.
Attorney Collins moved for a new trial
and arrest of judgment and quoted
authorities to show that the conviction
was contrary to evidence and to law, a*
the bet was consummated In Saata Clara
County and not in this county. Attorney
Coffey replied and the Judge after over
ruling the motion fined Corbett SoO, Daly

was at once given and bonds were fixed
in $Â°00 each.
Henry Schwartz walked Into Judge
Conlan s court yesterday morning and In
formed the JudKe ne had just arrived
from San Jose. A few minutes later At
torney Collins came into court and said
Schwartz was ready to submit to the
Jurisdiction of the court. Against the
protest of Collins the Judge set the case
for trial this afternoon at 2 o'clock and
ordered a venire for fifty talesmen to be
Issued. Schwartz was then arrested on
the bench warrant Issued Tuesday and
released on giving J100 cash ball. No
effort was made to bring Dr. Kahn Into
court to testify as to Schwartz's condl-

The case* of Daniel Crowley, George

Cabaniss' calendar yesterday. The Judge
had a consultation with Chief Sullivan
and Attorney Coffey as to bringing on
the cases for trial, as they had been con
tinued eight times since being transferred
to his court on July 28. He was informed
that the prosecution wanted the Schwartz
case disposed of before any of the others
were taken up and he was asked to again
continue the cases. They were called
yesterday afternoon and continued till
to-day to be set.
When the matter of the hearing of the
writ of habeas corpus on behalf of Harry

In the language .of the strets "Pop" Sul

POP" SULLIVAN', proprietor of The
Hoffman, a cafe in the commercial
part of the city, where the business
man quenches his thirst' with foam-
Ing beakers or sharpens his appetite with
cocktails, was in a tearful mood yes
terday. Withal he wore his usual smile,
but there was a twinge of regret In his
bosom as he watched his barboys ladling
out pink lemonades, imlk, sarsaparllla,
ginger ale and other beverages of the
milder order.
That he had not turned his refreshment
palace Into a temperance "joint" was ap
parent from the bottles of strong water
which reposed behind the bar. These bot
tles, filled to the brim with the choicest
wet-goods, stood In their place as a tempt
ing reminder of the joy and solace con
tained in them. Xot a. drop of flery liquid
could be poured Into a glass to alleviate
the suffering of the thirsty mortals who
move through the swinging doors each
evening. The honorable Board of Police
Commissioners said "nay, nay," and what
One well-known business man created
excitement in the afternoon by refusing
to pay for his refreshments â a thing un
heard of during the existence of the house.
Witnesses of the action said they did not
blame him. The business man was near
sighted. He called for his tipple and
moved over to the lunch counter to sam
ple its contents. Without looking at his
glass he drained It and after he stopped
sputtering, his look of disgust made the
barkeeper quake- In his boots. The busi
ness man started to leave without paying
when the cashier reached for a blunder
buss, leveled It at the Individual and
yelled "halt." When Informed that It
was loaded and might go off if he tried
to escape, the business man apologized
for his mistake and said: "I thought it
the customers said would not only be un
complimentary to that honorable body,
but be unfit, for publication.
It was pathetic to see patrons come into
the cafe and when confronted with a big
sign over the lookingglass which notified
them that "until future notice no Intoxi
cating liquors will be sold over the bar,"
sadly shake their heads and seek content
ment elsewhere.

Teachers on Substitute I/ist.
Miss E. A. Cleveland, Miss K. F. McCol
gan. Mrs. A. Griffith and Miss A. A. Hill
were retired as teachers in order that they
may avail themselves of the act creating
a public school teachers' annuity and re
tirement fund.
Mrs. Edna Coryelle was appointed
teacher of cooking in the grammar
schools, to take effect August 15, 1900, at
a salary of $63 per month.
It was resolved that in all consolidations
of classes, whenever the chronological
order is not followed in relieving teachers,
the principals shall state In writing satis
factory reasons for not doing so.
The- board allowed the United States
Civil Service Commission the use of the
Lowell High School for an examination
to be held on August 25.
A. Altschul was appointed special
teacher of German in the Adams Cos
mopolitan School at a salary of $40 per
month, he being required to teach one
half of each day.
Miss A. C. Timmons, formerly of the
Longfellow Primary School, was appoint
ed to the Pacific Heights Grammar School
and Miss M. I. Geary will be retained as
teacher in the same school.
Miss E. A. Llttlefield, formerly of Ham
ilton School, was assigned to Adams Cos
mopolitan School. Mrs. H. Heaphy, jan
itor of the Rincon School, was dismlsseed,
owing to the consolidation of the Rtncon
and Longfellow schools. Mrs. M. R.
Clyne was appointed janitor of the latter
school.
Appointments and Dismissals.
Principal Ida E. Coles asked that the
accommodations in the South End School
be increased. The board will consider the
advisability of fitting up two well equip
ped outside class rooms for the seventli
and eighth grades.
The commercial class In the "Washington
Evening School was discontinued, an In
vestigation showing that the principals
and patrons of the school desired a high
school class^
The board adopted a resolution that a
high school class be established in the
Washington Evening School, to be taught
by a teacher to be designated by the prin
cipal. No extra expense, either for In
struction or equipment for the class will
be Incurred, and if the average dally at
tendance falls below thirty the class will
be abolished.
New High School Class.
George Bates, teacher of Latin and
Greek in the Mission High School, was
finally placed on the unassigned list by
the board. The "job" has been hatching
for a month past and two weeks ago the
teacher was saved from dismissal by Su
perintendent Webster, who objected to
the Intended discrimination against Bates.
Webster made another appeal for Bates,
and asked why some teacher of less ex
perience could not be selected for dismis
sal. Director Denman replied that Prin
cipal O'Connor of the school had reported
against Bates' competency. Webster re
plied that the report was untruthful.
Bates had informed the Superintendent
In a letter that O'Connor had not spent
more than three minutes in his class at
any one time, nor more than twenty min
utes during the entire school year. Mark
replied to a question of Webster that this
statement had not been investigated by
the board. The resolution to place Bates
on the unassigned list, which, according
to Superintendent Webster, means his
practical elimination from the depart
ment, was concurred In by Mark, Den
man and Kincaid, Casserly being excused
from voting for reasons unexplained.
Bates Finally Dismissed.
For alx years I have been accused cf being
the agent of this house, and of receiving com
mission on the goods sold, but without avail,
for the charges teem to return, just as often
as they may eerve some political or commer
cial purpose. -
Miss Ball said further:
The only recommendation of drawing ma
terials to principals and teachers was made la
a circular issued by the president of the Board
of Education at the opening of school. ThUj
recommendation Included a variety of materials
representing four of the principal whol<:Â«alv
houses in the city. We nave no interest in any
one of these materials to the exclusion of
others, but we did advocate that the materials
should be uniform in each room, a requirement
which every thoughtful person will concede
to be necessary for satisfactory pedagogy.
The Board of Education passed a vote
of confidence yesterday In Miss Katherlno
M. Ball and Miss Dee Beebe, special
teachers of drawing. This action carried
with It complete exoneration and was the
result of a communication filed by the
two ladies, in which they denied certain
published statements of a malicious na
ture, to the effect that they had favored
particular firms in the purchase of. draw
ing materials by the pupils. In their peti
tion for vindication the teachers explained
their course as follows: .-

"You can Bay this, however," added the
labor Irsfier, "that there will be no gen
eral strike in San Francisco. The mlll
otvrers -would like to see the whole buiid-
Ittz industry tied up. but they never will.

continue to prosper jirst the same and
there will be plenty of work for all union
men."
President McCarthy of the Building
Trades Council s-aid last evening- that the
position of the millnien remained un
changed.
â¢"Several years ago the iron molders in
this city Inaugurated a strike against the
employment of apprentices. The iron
founders fought them to a finish, with the
result that many who for years had
steady employment lost their positions
end were reduced to extremities. The les
snn of that strike should be remembered
by the millmen. or history may ropoat
Jisplf. as the millowners are prepared to
maintain their present stand and not
submit the settlement to outsiders of a
question which admits of no arbitration."
"The millowners have stood this thing
so long that they are nov.- thoroughly de
termined to hire whom they please with
out dictation. The non-union men whom
they nov engage, will remain at work and
any who desire to withdraw from unions
and return may rest assured of protec
tion, whatever the outcome.
"The taen demand eight hours, and
after a careful consideration of all facts
and figures we art satisfied beyond all
doubt that such would be disastrous to
our Interests. We have stated frequently
why and it is unnecessary to repeat the
story.
"There is also another vital Issue in this
case and one whicn must be fought to a
liniBh. and as the battle has begun, may
as well be eettied now as hereaiter. For
several years we have endured the arro
gant and Increasing aggressiveness of
unions, arid yielded point after point, un
til now they have about reached the con
clusion that the workmen are supreme,
e.nd the employer is a mere nobody com
pelled to suoraii to their ever}- demand.
'"If we hire a mechanic, a shop delegate
immediately approaches and requests evi
dence of his connection with a union. If
he is a non-union man he is either threat
ened, bullyragged or intimidated into join
ing the union, or a committee awaits upon
the employer and he in his turn is either
compelled to make him Join the union or
leave the mill.
The rnlllowr.ers met In their new Quar
ters on Saascme street last evening. The
trouble Â¦with the operatives was discussed
at length. The question of arbitration was
brought up and it was the unanimous
ter.st- of the meeting that there was noth
