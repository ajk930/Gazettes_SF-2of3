WASHINGTON, Sept. 13.â General John
M. "Wilson, Chief of Engineers, U. s. a.,
has been endeavoring to communicate
with the,: officers ". of the engineers in
charge at Galveston to ascertain the con
ditions of the fortifications and the har
bor improvements, upon which more, than
$8,000,000 has been expended. General Wil
son. also was anxious to know, whether
there had been any loss of life among the
men in his department. '-" This morning he
received, two dispatches, one of which had
been delayed in transmission. . They are
as follows: . . "â¢" . - .

The damage at. Fort Crockett, Captain
Riche says, is not serious. The shore line
at Fort Crockett has moved back about
C00 feet. Fort San Jacinto appears to be
badly wrecked. The San Jacinto batteries
could not be reached by land, and inspec

At Fort Travis Bolivar Point, the dam

back about one hundred feet on the line
of these batteries.

DAMAGE DONE AT FORTS.
;" GALVESTON," Tex.. ' Sept. 13.â Captain
Charles: S.'Riche, U. S. A.', after he had
completed a tour of inspection of the
GALVESTON, Texas. Sept. 13.âGal
veston is beginning slowly to re
cover from the stunning blow of
last week, and though the city ap
pears to-night to be pitilessly des
olated the authorities, the commercial and
the industrial interests are setting their
forces to work and a start has at least
been made toward the resumption of busi
ness on a moderate scale. The presence
of. the troops has had a beneficial effect
upon the criminal classes and the fear of
a brief but desperate reign of anarchy
now no longer ekists. The liquor saloons
have at least temporarily gone out of
business and every strong limbed man
who has not his own abode to look after
is being pressed into service, so that, first
of all, the water service may be resumed,
the gutters flushed and the streets lighted.
The further the ruins are dug into the
greater becomes the increase in the num
ber of those who perished as their houses
tumbled about their heads. On the lower
beach yesterday a searching party found
a score of corpses within a small area,
going to show that the bulwarkof debris
that lies straight across the island.con
ceals many more bodies than have been
accounted for.- â¢
Volunteer gangs continue their work of
hurried burial of the corpses they find 'oh
the shores of Galveston Island, arid at the
many neighboring points where fatalities
attended the storm. .It .will be probably,
many days yet, however, before all the
floating bodies have found â¢- graves.
Bodies Washed Up.
'Along the beach bodies are constantly
being washed up. \ Whether' these arc
those which were swept out into the gulf
and drowned, or simply the return ashore
of some of those .cast, into the sea to
guard' against terrible pestilence, there is
no means of knowing. In any event the
Associated Press" correspondent In' a "trip
across the bay yesterday counted several
bodies tossing in the waves with a. num
ber of carcasses of cattle and horses.' the
stench of which was unbearable. la many
parts of the city the smell of decomposing
flesh Is apparent. Wherever such in
stahcoa are found' the authorities "are free
ly disinfecting. Only_ to-day a' babe lashea
to a mattress was picked up under a resl,
dence in .the very, heart of, the city and
buried. ... . . ;'. . . â¢. . . . .
.The city still presents the appearance of
widespread .wreck and ruin.- . Little -has
been done to clear- the streets of the ter
rible tangle of- wires and the masses -of
wreck, mortar, slate, stone and glass that
nish outgoing ; cargoes. These bridges
were each about three miles in length,
and the work of reconstruction will be a
stupendous undertaking.
One of the most serious results of the
storm has been the wrecking of the elec
tric light and street car plants. The city
has been In darkness for several nights
ajid only a few concerns which operate
their, own illuminating service are enabled
to do business: | Nearly every residence
has gone back to the primitive candle.
The absence of street lights drives all who
have no imperative bustness on'the streets
to their homes at nightfall, but the work
*)f the patrol system Is made more' diffi
cult thereby and the opportunity for loot
ing greater.
The jinotormen deserted their cars when
the fury of the wind and the rush of the
water made it no longer possible to oper
ate them. Attempts are being made now
to get the cars in. shape again. The great
destruction of livestock has eliminated
carriages and cabs as a means of trans
portation, and the need of the trolley
promises to beccme a most pressing one
when rebuilding begins. . ,
i Among the worst sufferers by the dis
aster were the ' churches. Nearly every
one of them felt the effect of the storm.
Some of them are wrecked beyond repair.
; Relief "Work Proceeds,
j The work of relief continues. Mayor
Jones and his associates are bending
every, nerve to open a direct line of trans
portation with Houston by which he may
be enabled promptly to receive the great
quantity of provisions which are now on
the way to the city.
""I 'wish to say, however," said Mayor
Jones, "we have made such arrangements
as will make it possible for us to feed the
needy until we can get in our supplies.
"We are relieving every case' presented to
us. I think within a day or two our trans
portation facilities will be sufficient tem
porarily to meet our needs. Galveston
has ! helped other, cities In their 'distress,
despite her' size, and we are consoled by
the generous /response of the country to
our appeal."
The relief committee ia striving to sys
tematize its work, and there Is undoubt
edly distress here which ought promptly
to be relieved.' Weazen-faced, bare-footed
j children Â¦ were engaged yesterday In the
. streets â¢ In eagerly appropriating spoiled
' and cast-off stocks of r"o<V.. The commit
tee has instructed the local drug stores
to provide the poor and needy with medi
cines at the expense of the relief fund.
bestrew them. of the sidewalks are
Impassable. Some of them are littered
with debris. Others are so thickly cov
ered with slime that walking on them is
out of the Question.
As a general rule substantial frame
buildings withstood better the blasts of
the gale than those of brick. In other in
stances, however, ' small wooden struc
tures, cisterns and whole sides of houses
have been plumped down in streets or
back yards squares away from where they
originally stood.'
Work of Reconstruction.
Here and there business men have al
ready put men to work to repair the dam
age done, but In the main the commercial
Interests seem to be unable to follow the
lead of those who show faith in the rapid
rehabilitation of the island city.
The appearance of the newspapers to
day after a suspension of several days Is
having a good effect, and both the News
and the Tribune are urging prompt suc
coring 'of the . suffering, and - then equal
promptness in ; reconstruction. It. is, diffi
cult to; say yet .what the ultimate effect
of the disaster is to be on the city. Many
people have left and some may never re
turn. The experiences. of. others still here
were so frightful that all will not remain
if they can conveniently find occupation
in other cities. ' ' ..'* \ Â¦Â¦.'
-The bulk of the population, however. Is
only temporarily panicstricken, and there
are hosts, of those who helped' to make
Galveston prosperous who look upon the
catastrophe as involving-. only a temporary
halt in the advancement of the city.*";
'What is most bothering business men at
present is what attitude the railroads, and
especially the? Southern Pacific, will .as
sume with" respect to, reconstructing. The
decision of the transportation lines will
do much more than ; anything to restore
confidence. 13ig ships, new arrivals, rode
at anchor to-day in front of the city. They
had Just- reached the port and found the
dock and pier damage so widespread that
no accommodation -could'be given to them.
Thby found sheds torn away, .freight cars
overturned and planking ripped off. Â¦
Steamers High and Dry.
Th'e steamships~reported ashore in early
reports are, save . two, the,. Xorweglan
steamer Gyller and : the British steamer
Norma, still j high and dry. No examina
tion is yet possible as to the condition of
those' still on the send. . . *. . ',
Apparently Galveston has no Immediate
need for ships. The destruction j of the
bridges of all the railroads entering the
city makes It well nigh Impossible to fur-
Presence OF Troops in the Stricken City
Has Checked the Reign of Anarchy.
Relief and Reconstruction Proceed.

MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND BODIES HAVE
BEEN IDENTIFIED AT GALVESTON.
f^\ ALVESTON, Texas, Sept. 13. â More than 2000 dead
\JL bodies have been identified, and the estimate of Mayor
Jones that 5000 souls perished in ; Saturday's hurricane
does not appear to be magnified. The city is being patrolled by
troops and a citizens' committee, and a semblance of order is ap
pearing. From all parts of the United States and some por
tions of England many thousands of dollars are pouring in for
the relief of Texas' destitute storm sufferers. Trainloads of
provisions and clothing are also hurrying toward Galveston.
Property losses are mounting- higher as details arrive, and
some estimates for Galveston reach as high as $20,000,000.
There are 25,000 homeless here to be taken care of, and it is a
question whether the city can or will be rebuilt. There seems
to be a disposition on the part of the leading citizens, however,
to start resolutely where the storm left off and raise a new city
from the ruins of the old.

LIFB-SAVEHS ESCAPE.
NEW ORLEANS. Sept. 13â A spe
cial to the Picayune from Galves
ton says: The relief measures or
panlzed here are running more
smoothly than before; the- desti
tute are receiving supplies from the va
rious depots; the sick are receiving the
best care and physicians are giving their
service gratis. Reports continue to be re
ceived from near-by coast and mainland
towns telling of destruction and loss of
life. The coast for miles inland is said to
be covered with bodies. One gentleman

Virginia Point, and parties are out In
every airection engaged In the same duty.
Charles Patterson, connected with, the
Gulf and Interstate Railway, came in
from Bolllvar Point and reported that
they had burled between 300 and 400 of
Galveston's dead and that on Bollivar pe
ninsula, from the point of East High
lands for twenty-one miles south, every
thing -was washed away. General Polk,
general manager of the Santa Fe, has re
ceived reports that every station-house,
freight depot and water tank on the line
between Virginia Point and Rosenburg
Junction, sixty-six miles north, was
either blown away cr wrecked, and miles
of track washed away. All towns be
tween thepe two points were yeverely
damaged by the hurricane and each had
a death list from nve to fifteen people,
v.ith many more or less injured.
Secretary Bailey of the Galveston
k Wharf Company estimates the loss to
:hat company at $303,000, while prominent
ehip-brokers place the loss to foreign
ehippijig in the port at from S500,OCÂ»0 to
JTOO.OOO.
It is conservatively estimated that the
lo?s in property, goods, nu-rehandise, etc.,
Will exceed 51 li.i (00.000.
I>ecomposition being so rapid, the fur

tated portion of the city has been inhib
ited and the Interment ordered where

body and memorandum of the effects
thereon have tt-en taken fcr future iden

Houston has sent eleven tow-barge? ,
loaded with relief supplies and more will
follow. Port Arthur has st-nt several

numerous points that stores and supplies
are en the way for the sicic, all of which
will be relieved to some extent. The piling

tiie Jetties Is gune and rocks as large as
rooms are piled into the channel, making
it exceedingly hazardous for ships to

Eizes piled high and dry on the beach.
The water averaged a depth of five feet
over the entire islaLfi. The older resi
dents of the island, profiting by former
experiences, bored and chopped holes In

they escaped. The slip of water at the

EIGHTY-FIVE
PASSENGERS LOST
ON FLOODED TRAIN
NEW ORL.KANS. Sept. 13.â The
States this morning received a
telegram from Hon. John H. Poe.
member of the State Board of- Ed
ucation, residing at Lake Charles,
stating that elghty-flve lives were lost on
the Gulf and Interstate train which left
Beaumont early Saturday morning from
Bolivar Point, after having made connec
tion with the Southern Pacific train which
left this city Friday night. Mr. Poe was
one of the passengers on this train, and
fortunately, together with a few others,
he sought safety in the lighthotree at Bol
ivar Point, and was caved. The train
reached Bolivar Point about noon and all
preparations were made to run the train
on the ferry boat, preparatory to cross
ing the bay. The wind blew so swiftly,
however, that the ferry could not make- a
landing, and the conductor of the train,
after allowing it to stand on the tracks
for a few minutes! started it back toward
Beaumont. The wind increased so rap
idly, coming in from the open sea, that
soon the water had reached a level with
the bottom of the seats within the cars.
It was then that some of the passengers
sought safety in the nearby lighthouse.
Eut Mr. Poe states in his telegram in
spite of all their efforts eighty-five people
were blown away or drowned. The train
was entirely wrecked. Doubtless some of
the killed were from New Orleans, as the
train made direct connections with the
Southern Pacific train which left here
Friday night, and there were a large
number of New Orleans passengers
aboard. It is known that at least some
of these were bound for Galveston. Those
who were saved had to spend over fifty
hours in the lighthouse on almost no ra
tions.
HOUSTON THE HAVEN
OF THE UNFORTUNATES
HOl'STOX, Tex., Sept. 13.â Houston Is
now the haven of the unfortunate people
of Galveston. Trains have already brought
in between 800 and 1000 of the survivors,
and a motley crowd they are. Men bare
headed, barefooted, hatless and coatlcss,
with swollen feet and bruised and black
ened bodies and heads, were numerous.
Women of wealth and refinement fre
quently hatless and shoeless, with gowns
in shreds, were among the refugees. Some
times there would be a man. wife and a
child or two, but these cases were rare;
nearly all of those who came in having
suffered the loss of one or more members
of their family.
Never were there so many sad hearts.
Men bereft of wives and children, women
who were widowed, children who were
parentlessâ it was enough to touch the
heart of any one, and it did so. Never
were there more heroic acts. Although a
week ago the people had happy homes,
they are now homeless and penniless.
They bore up bravely. True, they all
wore sad expressions, but there was no
whimpering, no complaining. They were
all made to fed that Houston is now their
home, that they are welcome and that
everything for their comfort and welfare
is being done. They are being housed
and fed, and those in need of medical at
tention are placed in the hospitals, where
they receive every care. Many of the ref
ugees to reach Houston had tasted little
or no food since the storm.

GAIA'ESTON has had more than her share of disaster in the sixty-three years of her existence. Four times has
she been visited by wind and wave and fire. The first visitation was in her early days, in the late forties,
when storm and wave together, as in the present instance, swept away the whole town au_d a large proportion
of her inhabitants were lost. Every building in the. piece, all of them of wood, was wrecked and carried away.
She soon built up again, however, and more substantially -than before, and though her streets were often
flo'oded with the wind-driven waters of the bay or gulf she escaped further serious damage until October, 1S57, when
during a storm which then occurred the water rose 6 C-10 feet above mean low water stage, which was sufficient to
flood the streets and the' lower stories of all the houses, causing much damage to property, but no direct loss of
life. , Â¦ â¢ -
Acain, in 1S75. there was a rise under the force of the wind of 5% feet, covering, the whole island except a smalt
area In the southern part~bf the "city, and doing much damage to property, but with little loss of life. Two years later
a shore wind, with a velocity of sixty miles per hour, caused a rise of 5 2-10 feet, Hooding: all the business part of the
city.
The mean rise and fall of the tide at Galveston is 1 1-10 feet; but spring tides occasionally rise three feet "above
and fall two feet below the plane of mean low water.' : Fluctuations between much wider limits are not Infrequent
under the influence of heavy winds. In. this latest instance the wind, after blowing from the north or. bay side of
the city for some hours and piling the water .up against and over the wharves, which all He on that side, suddenly
whipped around to the east, driving the waters of the bay. back ag'ain and those of the gulf against' the other side
These, which are said to have risen to a height of eleven feet, ran through the streets with the velocity of a millrace
sweeping away all the lighter structures but not seriously damaging those more strongly built.' The wind, however*,
which, according to the observations. of the engineer of the Southern Pacific Railroad' stationed there, was. blowing at
the time some seventy-eight miles per .hour, unroofed many of these and wrecked 'others. â¢
Besides the foregoing instances; of wreck from flood and storm, " Oalveston was on November 13 1S85 visited by
a destructive : conflagration., The flames. swept across the residence portion of the city from the bay to the gulf devas
tating an area of over 100 acres, embracing forty thickly populated squares. The houses were almost entirely of wood
and the destruction was .complete.' The loss; amounted to about $1,500,000.
, .\. ln i? P . l . te^Â°a. a V ; h r V i' V^r' the , c!ty l . has always been quickly; rebuilt and bettered. One-tenth of the whole cotton crop '
of the United^tates, finds Its outlet ; through Galveston, .besides her other business, and on her present site. In obedience
to the demands of commerce, Galyeaton must stand for time to "come/. V? - -Â¦-

MACARTHUR SENDS HIS
LATEST DEATH REPORT
MRS. CORBETT
HAS NOT GONE
TO SEEK JIM
NEW YORK, Sept. 13.â With the privi
lege accorded -to ] her. sex, Mrs. James J.
Corbett changed' her mind at the last
moment and did not sail for Europe In
search of- her recreant husband, as was
reported. She still insists that she may
follow him to Kngland, but not until some
progress is made in the divorce case. g
Through her counsel, Mrs. Corbett to-day
obtained from Judge Scott of the Supreme
Court an order for the service of the sum
mons and complaint In her suit for di
vorce upon her husband by publication.
She names Uargaret Cornellle. who was
a passenger on the Campania with Mr.
Corbett, as co-respondent in her com
plaint, and also charges that her husband
has been guilty of improper conduct with
other women whose names she does not
know.
Mrs. Corbett was herself authority for
the story that she would follow her hus
band to Europe. She left her former res
idence In West Thirty- fourth street and
after telling the servants In the house to
say that she had gone to England, went
to "an up-town hotel, where she registered
under an assumed name. j
A cablegram was sent to-day to CorBett
to be delivered to him as soon as he ar
rives in England, requesting that he taice
the next steamer home, in order that he
may assist so far a> possible to- refute
charges of crooked dealings In his battle
with McCoy made by wives of the two
pugilists. John Consldlne. Corbett's man
ager, said he did not believe the pugilist
would paV-any attention to the cable
gram, but would complete his visit as he
had planned.

SYNDICATE TO
FLOAT THE NEW
GERMAN LOAN
Emperor William Preparing
to Borrow About Â»
$25,000,000.
It Is understood that Germany 13 seek
ing and will likely succeed in borrowing
$2T>.000,W)0 from New York-, Chicago and
Milwaukee lenders. <r
It Is evident that there is a desire to re
plenish the German stocks of gold, which
is the direct motive to the negotiation
with the American bankers by the Ger
man authorities, as it 'was of the Urltish
authorities in the allotment of, over half
of the latest Issue of British exchequer
bonds to New York bankers. The opera
tions ase closely analogous to that of tho
United States Government several years
ago when the placing of a bond Issue was
made conditional for imports of gold.
Bankers and brokers In Wall street as
sert that there Is a large demand at pres
ent In this country for foreign securities.
One tlrm states that it has placed fO.OOO.O.O
of foreign government securities among
domestic investors in the last ' twelve
months. High-grade domestic ,sectsrHi*-.i
are held at a price that makes the yearly
return Insignificant, and the high money
rates abroad keep even government bondl*
there at a price low enough to make the
return attractive to American investors.
In the event of a, reversal of the trade
balance and the relative level of money
rates these securities would find their way
back to Europe In 'the adjustment, as
American securities have come home In
the present conditions.
- NEW TORK. Sept. 13.â It was aemi-of
ficlally stated to-day at the office of Kuhn.
I/>eb & Co. that with one or two other
banking houses they would form a syndi
cate to float the new German loan. They
will be aided by the agents of the Deutsch
Bank of Berlin and New Tork. The offi
cial announcement will probably be issued
HAZELTON, Pa., Sept. 13-Meetlngs of

"Workers wore held ton-ight throughout
the anthracite coal district. Indications
are that tho strike will be general and
that most of the non-union men will go
out. By to-morrow nignt It is expected
work will be suspended at practically all
the collieries. The Delaware, i^ackawan
na and "Western and and Hud
son companies are swearing In deputies
to be in a position to guarantee protection
to any of their men "who will go to work
Monday. It is believed that if the strike
Is a long one many Hungarians nnd other
foreigners will return to Europe.
Temporary headquarters for the na
tional officers of the United Mine Work
ers have been prepared here.
Miners at Hazelton Making Ready
, for the long- Struggle.
PREPARING TO STRIKE.
It can be seen that the miners are pre
pared for a long light.
To-morrow will be spent in preparations
lor such emergencies as may arise during
the strike. Saturday night President
Mitchell will go to Hazelton and from
there to different points In the field for the
purpose of holding mass-meetings.
To-<3ay was a busy one at headquarters.
All day loqg telegrams were being re
ceived and sent out. Secretary-Treasurer
Wilson and his force of clerks were busy
answering the heavy mail that came in.
touching upon strike matters, and
throughout all of the offices there was an
air of subdued excitement. Frequently
the two chief executive officers of the or
ganization were closeted together in con
sultation upon some, phase of the situa
tion brought up byKhe news from the
lieutenants In tho Held.
There is practically no means of arriv
ing at any estimate of the resources of the
miners available for the maintenance of
the people to be called out by the strike.
President Mitchell and Secretary Wilson,
the latter the official head of the finance
department Â¦ of the organization, have
tirmly declined to give out any figures on
this point.
"It would be a simple matter for the
operators," they said, "if ithey knew what
amount of money we had, to wait until it
was -exhausted. Moreover, it would be
folly on our part to make public at this
time any information upon which an esti
mate of our financial Â¦ strength could be
based." 3*$iE33aB9S?Nri9|50j
At the close of last year there were 93.
134 bona fide members, in the mine work
ers' ; organization. At the convention" In
January it was decided to levy upon each
of these members an assessment' of 23
cents a month to be placed In the hands
of the National executive board for use
as a defense lund. Part of this money has
been used In small strikes, but the bulk
of it is probably available at this time.
Since January of l he present year ; there
has been a very material increase of the
membership, which, of course, carries with
It an increase in the defense fund. Aside
from the money in, the hands of the Na
tional executive board, local unions in a
number of States have accumulated large
sums of. money Inthelr. treasuries which,
while not at the command of the executive
officers of the organization, will probably
be placed; in the strike fund.
Contributions from ; other trades unions
can bo counted on, and . from theso Â¦ facts
When any miner, feelins the burden of these
conditions, has gone to the management and
asked to have them rf-moved. he has been told
that lf he does not like It he can quit. Vvhen
they have organized at any colliery and have
sent committees to the management asking to
have their grievances remedied the' committee
has either been discharged or they have been
told that the evils coul.l not be remedied be
caupe of the competition from other companies.
When the representatives of the miners of the
whole region have met and asked thÂ«> coal com
panies to mÂ«*et them In Joint convention to ar
range vases nnd conditions upon an equltabl"
basis bo that each would know what his com
petitor was paying, and no advantage could be
taken of any one. their petition for a confer
ence has been completely Ignored.
When the' business men, clergymen and other
outside influence have appealed to the coal
companies to correct some of the evils com
plained of their requests have been denied, and
when as a last resort the officers of our organi
zation hav* wired the presidents of the great
railroad companies, who control the anthracite
coal fleldB, offering to submit the whole question
to arbitration, the proposition has been treated
with silent contempt. Having exhausted all
other means of adjustment we had reached the
point where we must either advise the miners
of the anthracite region to continue working
under these unjust and tyrannical conditions or
counsel a strike.
We have chosen the latter, and having done
bo we invite a thorough, impartial and public
investigation of the conditions existing in the
anthaclte coal fields. We believe that the great
American heart throbs in, sympathy for the
downtrodden and oppressed, whether In
this or any other land. We know the great
power of the public press In molding public
sentiment. With an abiding faith in the jus
tice of our cause and a consciousness of the
knowledge that whosoever else may vilify and
abuse us the great Jehovah knows and under
stands the rectitude of our purpose, we appeal
to the American people and to the American
press as the greatest arbiters on earth to as
sist us. and sustain us in our hour of trial.

S^ertal Dispatch to The CalL
NEW YORK. Sept. 13.-Pollceroan Vir
gil X. Bakulich of San Francisco created
a mild sÂ«?rÂ»satlon in the office of Colonet
Dudley X. Phelps of the law division of
the Cusron-house a Fhort time ago when
he applied to Francis S. McAvoy. chief
cleric of the division, for permission, to
take a body to Europe. Bakullch added
to Mr. McAvcy's astonishment when he
remarked in a 'reassuring way that the
body was in a metal trunk, Â¦which he had
brought with him from San Francisco.
The policeman calmly said that the body
had been severed at the knees so that it
mlg-ht more eaisilv be carried in the trunk.
Mr. McAvoy was uncertain whether
BalvUlJch was Insane or a practical Joker
until the man explained that the body
was that of his father, who had been
crowned in a mine in California twenty-
Air. ilcAvoy declined to grant a permit,
however, and told him that the Federal
authorities had nothing to do with the
case, and so far as? they were concerned
there was no objection to his taking a
quantity of ancient bones out of the
country or anywhere else.
To-day word was received that Baku
tch had ajrived at Bremen by the
Faderland and had proceeded to
Austria.
Dr. T. C. Taylor, assistant registrar of
the Department of Health; said that in
view of the fact that the body had been
interrt-d tor f-o long a time there Â¦was no
r.eed for Uakullch to obtain permission lo
take the bones through New York.
The Baku'lch referred to is probably

About six wof-ks agt> liakultch Â¦was

placed in a trur.k. inu-nding- to take them
to Austria, so that they could be buried

porters of Aguinaldo and
FORT WATXE, Ind.. Sept. 13.â The
people of this city to-day dedicated to
the memory of General Henry W. Lawton
a monument crowned by a. cannon cap
tured by him and christened the principal
city park In honor of Lowton. The .exer
cises were under the auspices of the Un
ion Veteran Legion. William J. Bryan
was the principal orator of the occasion.
Governor Mount spoke just before Mr.
Bryan. The Governor took up the ques
tion of the Philippine war. denouncing
Acn:i:ia.ldo by name and showing a tend
ency to strong condemnation or the in
surgents and all who may sympathize
with him. He spoke of the'facl that the
gun had been taken from men who had
turned it upon our flag and our soldiers.
The Governor added:
If this cannon was not captured In a Just
and humane war and from those opposing tbe
lawfully constituted authority over thes* Isl
ands, flgrhtlng the soldiers of the Government
that had liberated them from Spanish thrall
dom. thon where Is the honor of the capture
arrd the glory of this gift? Honor these In
surgents as patriots and then you Interpret
wrongfully the words, the will and the act cÂ£
our dead hero; this service becomes a hollow
mockery and this trophy of patriotic valor be
comes a menument to tho dishonor of our
eoldlers and the shame of our country.
1 trust - I may never see the day . when I
Ehall eo far forget my devotion and my loyalty
to my country as to characterize our soldiers
as the agents of oppression, turning the banner
of liberty Into an ersign of imperialism, nor
do I apprehend such a consummation.
Mr. Bryan made no direct reference in
his address to the utterances of Governor
Mount about the Philippine war. He said
In part:
I was Invited to participate In thlÂ» reunion,
not as a candidate for office, but as a citizen
of this republic, and I am here to 6peak to
you not es a candidate for office, but as a
citizen. I can hardly say that I em here as.
a soldier, for I feel that my military service
was so Insignificant compared with the service
of many who are here to-day that I am Hardly
entitled to be classed among the ooldlers. b<j
far as my title is concerned I feel that it is
hardly faJr that one Fhould be called a colonel
who saw no active duty and who did not have
his courage tested upon a battlefield.
I have eupreme faith In the man who fights
when his country needs fighters, and then
works when his country needs workers, and
I pay high tribute to the volunteer soldiers oi
this country.
You have met to-day to do honor to the
memory cf a soldier, of one in the reÂ»jular
army. We need soldiers In the rejjular army.
\\ e need some who arÂ» ever prepared by mili
tary training for the work of the soldier. The
differences between us are aifTerences as to
the number of regulars that we need. It It
not the l.lare to-day to disoufs the size of
our standing army; this Is net the time to
exchange opinions an to how many soldiers
we need; but no mattT what our opinions
may be us to the is'.ze of our standing arm>,
we are all jrlad that when an emergency come*
we nnd the roldter measures up to the stand
ard of a Â»:>ldler like Lawton did.
Mr. Bryan said that there were victo
ries of peace as well as of war. and that
he longed for "the time to come when no
hostile arm will be raised against a fel
low man."

CALL BUREAU, WELLINGTON
HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Sept.
13. â Chairman Jones and the Demo
cratic political managers will be
charged by the Republican National
Committee -with being* responsible for
the strike in the anthracite coal re
gions. Since early in the spring it
has been reported that the Demo
cratic managers intended, to inau
gurate strikes, labor troubles and
distress among 1 the families of
strikers in thÂ© interest of Bryan dur
ing the pending campaign, and ever
since the trouble in yie anthracite
regions begun the Republican lead
ers have been trying to obtain docu
mentary evidence that would connect
their opponents with the affair. In
this they have not been successful,
though they declare their conviction
that the Democratic committee is at
the bottom of the trouble and that
John Mitchell, president of the
United Mine-Workers, has allowed
himself to be made the tool of de
signing politicians.
Chairman Hanna and other lead
ing Republicans are constantly in
communication with, leading: Repub
lican members of labor organizations.
These men, it is said, do not hesitate
to condemn the strike and to deplore
Â¦what they call the "prostitution of
organized labor to partisan politics.'-'
MINERS EXPLAIN
THEIR GRIEVANCES
Statement Bearing on the
Strike Issued to the
Public.
INDIANAPOLIS, Sept. 13.-In order to
place before the public the conditions ex
isting In the anthracite fields of Pennsyl
vania President John Mitchell and Sec
retary Treasurer W. B. Wilson of the
ynlted Mine Workers of America issued
to-day to the public a statement giving
the causes that have led up to the strike.
After the statement had been given out
for publication President Mitchell said:
"At this time I do not believe anything
will take place between now "and Monday
that will prevent the strike. All the in
formation coming to my office to-day in
dicates that the struggle is practically
"I have- been receiving messages all
day from the anthracite region which In
dicate clearly that the indorsement of the
strike and the Issuance of the order has
met with the approval of the miners.
There are a few details to be arranged,
but the men are prepared for the fight.
I have not received to-day any informa
tion direct or Indirect to show that the
operators have receded from their posi
tion."
The statement follows:
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Sept. 13.â The mem
bers of the national executive board of the
United Mine /Workers of America, realizing
that the material we*fare of a large number of
the American people will be Injuriously a/Tected
by a suspension of work in the coal fields ot
Pennsylvania, knowing the Irresistible power
of a concentrated public opinion and having a
profound respect for the opinions of their fel
low men. have decided to make a general state
ment for the information of the public.
No one can have a greater appreciation of
the far-reaching effect of a strike of the anthra
cite coal miners. The coal miners and their
families, the coal companies and the coal car
riers are but a small portion of the vast multi
tude whose interests are so directly and indi
rectly connected with the coal trade that a
conflict of such magnitude will affect their
welfare.
Vast Interests Affected. ?
The domestic fuel supply of the West; the
great manufacturing industries of the Kast;
the wholesale and retail business establish
ments; the great ocean, lake, canal and rail
road transjxirtatlon ln^erests, laboring men and
capitalists will all be affected by such a gigan
tic struggle. That the world may know that
we have done all that honorable men can do
to avoid the conflict we herewith submit a few
facts lor careful consideration:
The average wages of -the anthracite miner
for many years have been less than $250 an
nually. During that period or time the cost
of many of the necessaries ot life has been
Increased 20 per cent. An Increase in the cost
of living without a corresponding Increase of
wages Is equivalent to a reduction in wages.
Â¦> The laws of the State of Pennsylvania make
2400 pounds a ten of anthracite coal, yet an
thracite coal miners are compelled to mine from
2700 to 4000 i<ounds for a ton, and in addition
to that are docked -exorbitant amounts, often
reaching 12 per cent of their dally earnings,
for any Impurities which may be sent out with
their coal. Where they are paid by the car,
instead of being required to furnish a well
rounded heap on the car. at the breakers, as"
was originally Â¦ agreed to, they have gradually
been compelled to Increase the' amount of coal
Jn each car by., building the same perpendicu
larly from sir to eighteen inches Â¦ above . the
edge. They are compelled to purchase ." the
powder used in mining from their employers,
paying $2 75 per keg for a grade, of powder'that
can be purchased elsewhere for (1 to. per keg
and which wholesales for about %l per keg

Statement but a Military Guard "Will
Be Lef^at Peking.
LONDON. Sept. 14. 4 a.Â»m.â No further
light is thrown this morning upon Lf
Hung Chang's intended movements. The
Times has an Interesting dispatch from
Peking, dated September 4, which says In
part:
"Russia has decided to withdraw her
legation from Peking, leaving a purely
military command. An official announce
ment of this Is expected to-day. The other
powers will also presumably withdraw
their legations, leaving Pelting under tho
military control of the allies during tho
winter at least.
"At a meeting of the generals thÂ© Rus
sian commander announced that Russia
would maintain 15,000 troops during the
Â¦ winter.
1 "The German commander said that Ger
many would keep the same number and
the Japanese commander announced that
Japan would have 22,000.
"The British general was not in a posi
tion to make an announcement. There is
everv indication, however, that Lord Sal
isbury has determined that our present
subordinate position in Peking must be
come still humbler. In the best-In formed
quarters the opinion is expressed that
Russia and Germany are acting In accord.
Russia seeking the definite alienation of
all territory north of the great wall and
Germany the annexation of Shantung,
Kiangsu and the Yangtse provinces. Rus
sia also seeks to restore the power of the
Empress Dowager and the Emperor, in
order to be enabled to wield her influence
through them over the remaining prov
inces. The dismemberment of China seems
almost inevitable.
RUSSIA TO WITHDRAW.
heard from on the subject, but the dispo
sition is to regard their communications
not as answers, but rather as argumenta
tive statements, which leave the main ia
sue still open for d'scusslon. This point,
however, becomes of diminished impor
tance in view of the announced purpose
of the Russian Government to modify the
terms of its original proposition !n the
manner indicated.
all the foreign troops, in the opinion of the
officials here.
An Inference from the Russian state
ment Is that Li's coming to Peking will
be forwarded by Russia in the hope of
making the desired arrangement for the
establishment of a Chinese government
there.
As Ll- cannot roach the capital from
Shanghai, starting to-morrow, inside of a
week. It may be that there will be no de
velopments in the international situation
within that period of time.
Our Government has not been advised
even yet that all of the answers to the
Russian note have been returned. It is
said that all of the powers have been
for the protection of American life and
property In China pending a final settle
ment, it has succeeded in attaining this
object, as is indicated in the response
from Li Hung Chang presented to Assist
ant Secretary IitH mis morning by Minis
ter Wu.
The department asked Li Hung Chang
"without further delay to give assurance
that the life and property of Americans
wilt henceforth be respected throughout
the Chinese empire."
The Viceroy nas given the assurance
asked for. His wora came in the shapt?
of a cable dispatch to Minister Wu, dated
yesterday at Shanghai. Mr. Wu called at
the State D.epartmint this morning and
presented this answer to Dr. Hill. He in
turn sent it forward to the President It
will be for the latter to decide whether
Li's- assurance is sufficient to meet the
needs of the case.
Ll Hung Chang's message removed per
haps the last obstacle to the speedy be
ginning of negotiations for the termina
tion of the Chinese trouble, and the only
doubt that now exists la as to his ability
to redeem his pledge to protect American
interests and stop the outrages on the
missionaries and native converts. If he
can do this and thus manifest the exist
ence of a de facto government there is no
reason to doubt that negotiations will be
immediately in order.
The notice that Russian troops will not
evacuate Peking until some arrangements
have been made for the Installation of a
government to take charge of affairs Is
directly In line with the aim the State
Department has been pursuing In the ex
changes with Li Hung Chang, and If this
Russian decision is adhered to it certainly
will facilitate the ultimate withdrawal of

\/V/ that was mar. at hand yesterday
'Â¥ y over the evacuation proposal of
the Russian Government has
been averted for a time at least,
and tho diplomatic side of the matter has
become again the object of attention. The
order. to Gentral Chaffee to leave at once
which was expected in some ouarters was
not issued to-day. Instead earnest efforts
are belngr made to , arrange the prelimin
aries for the negotiations which are ex

troubles.
The Chinese Government has made swift
answer to the late<^ communication from
the State Der.artmont relative to the rec
ognition of Ll Hnnc Chang cs an envoy
competent to negotiate a peace settlement.
There never has betn any doubt here as
to the sufficiency of Li's credentials as a
plenipotentiary, but the effort of the State
Department has been to cause him to use
any extraordinary powers he might have

MRS. BARDIN
SAYS HUSBAND
DESERTED HER
Wife of the Monterey County
Capitalist Sues for
Divorce.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALINAS, Sept. 13.â Quite a flurry was
caused in society circles in this city this
afternoon when It became publicly
known and a matter of record that Sirs.
Mary H. Bardln wished a legal separation
from her husband. James Bardln, one of
the wealthiest and most influential citi
zens of thl3 community. Especially was
It a surprise that Mrs. Bardin should
charge desertion as the cause for the
action. Mr. Bardln's estate Is valued at
over $100,000, and up to this time he was
considered a most liberal man, as well aa
an ample provider for his family.' He Is
interested in all public enterprises, as well
as charitable movements, but still his
spouse of twenty years alleges that he
has deserted her.
The Bardins have lived In Blanco, near
this city, for many years, and for the past
year of more Mrs. Bardin has been in
Southern California, supposed to be re
cuperating after an operation.
Mr. Bardin went to Paris several
months ago and only returned a few
weeks since. Hardly had he returned
home when he heard of his wife's desire
to be legally separated. The action, how
ever, was not begun until to-day.
Both parties to the action are old set
tlers of this valley and are connected with
pome of the best families In the State.
They have apparently lived happily to
gether for many years. They are among
the foremost people in society of this vi
cinity and the action is indeed a shock
to the social community, as well as the
public In general.
Mr. Bardin has lived In California many
years and has made a fortune in the cul
ture of sugar beets, and this year has a
vast acreage in the saccharine producing
vegetable. The suit will no doubt, when
brought Into court, produce many sensa
tional phases.

PACIFIC GROVE. Sept. 13.â Nearly the ]
entire membership of the California Meth
ofllBt EpiscopaJ Conference, one of the
largest in America, assembled in the
Methodist church in this city this morn-
Ing to begin the work of the second day
of the forty-Aighth annual session of the
conference, and when the presiding offi
cer. Bishop John W. Hamilton, called the
body to order It was found that the inter
est of yesterday was increased. The call
of the roll for yesterday's absentees
showed one of the largest attendances
ever recorded in the minutes of the Cali
fornia conferences.
After the opening- business the presid
ing elders' reports were taken up, that of
Dr. S. G. Gale of the Napa district being
presented first." A marked Improvement
in church work an<l church building j
throughout the districi and a striking in- i
crease in benevolent collections and j
church and Epworth League membership j

from the house.
BiFhpp Hamilton then made the an- j
nounepment of a very important change j
In the character of thi<? body, that of the (
eeparatlon of the Japanese district from
the conference and organizing it into the j
Pacific Japanese Mission, which Is virtu- [
ally, though not technically as yet. a con- !
ference by.itsf-lf. This change was mÂ»ces- '
eitated by the great increase In the terri
tory covered since the annexation of
Hawaii.
The report of Dr. M. C. Harris, the pre
siding e\(lcT of tho olJ Japanese district,
was therefore listened to with extraor
dinary lntTc->*t. In his report Dr. Harris
told many interesting facts, among which
was the harm done to Japanese mission
work by the rwent anti-Japanese feeling
on this roaj=t and the plague scare In San
Francisco. In ihe course of his report lie
highly oommen<i*'d the action of the Fed
eral court* in raising the quarantine up
on Chinatown.
At the clOW of Dr. Harris' report Hon.
H. K. Carroll of NÂ»v. T York, missionary
Ffcretary of the Methodist Kpifscopai
church in America, was presented to this
conference and iddremed the body briefly
upon the monetary sine of mission work,
ptvinff some interesting statistics. In his
late capacity of Commissioner to Porto

ROCK ISLAND MAY
% BUILD TO SAN DIEGO
Surveying Parties Said to Be Laying
Out a Line Across the Desert
From Yuma.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO, Sept. 13.â Deputy ; District
Attorney J. N. Metcalf, who has just re
turned from Hedges, reports that he had
a.. conversation. with a prominent railroad
man who eave him positive assurance
that the Rock Island road was preparing
to build into San Diego. This railroad
man is interested in the project to build
from Salt Lake to Los Angeles and has
holdings in other ' railroads, . so that he
evidently knew whereof he spoke. 1 He
said the Rock Island purveying party was
on the desert this side of Yuma, running
toward San Diego, and that, they were
working across the desert in almost, a di
rect line from Yuma. He said he had It
on reliable authority that' the Rock Isl
and road was making plans for extending
its line to the Pacific Coast, so as to have
an ocean outlet and benefit' by, the in
creased trade with the Orient.' *-..-. .
The plans are to build across Arizona
and from Yuma direct to San Diego. This
will give San Diego a direct Eastern out
let and the competing line, for' which it
has long been looking. Rock Island offi
cials have at last realized how much dis
tance can be saved by a short cut to the
coast by way of San Diego, and they aro
preparing to take advantage of the op
portunity. The story told by Mr. Metcalf
is in accordance with that told by . W. E.
Smythe, vice president of the Water and
Forest Association of California, in hlÂ«
address at- the Chamber of Commerce Â»

SAM RAFAEL, Sept. 13.â An . unprece
dented run of smelt took place along the
shore above El Campo during the high
tide this afternoon. The- water for-sev
eral hundred yards- from shore fairly
seethed with struggling fish. A large
whale, !n company with a smaller one,
spent several hours among the frightened
schools collecting a good dinner. Several
amateur fishermen captured- Immense
quantities of the fish by simply scooping
them out of the water.
MIS3 Maud Scranton, who was one of a
party of picnickers on fhore. upon seeing
the fish had the Wnltonian spirit so
stirred within her that she sprang into a
boat moored to the rocks and commenced
landing the smelt in the boat. Armed
Â¦with only a large sun hat. the young lady
scooped over a hundred pounds of the
silvery fish from the water at the stern
of the crnlt. Every one had fish to tat
and give away, and old fishermen are only
regretting that Mr. Whale does not give
them notice when he Intends driving an
other school ofsmelt shoreward.

DENVER, Sept. 13.-J. B. Wilson, a
wealthy dry goods merchant of Sacra
mento, Cal., was the first man robbed in
the Chicago sleeper Clive by a masked
highwayman near HaJeler, Nebr., Wed
nesday morning. From Mr. Wilson the
hold-up secured a three-carat diamond
pin, worth at least $250; a pair of diamond
cuffbuttons and $20 in cash. Said Mr.
Wilson:
â¢â¢I was aroused by screams, pulled the
curtains of my berth apart and looked
back. The sight that greeted me fairly
froze my blood. I saw the brakeman ad
vancing up the aisle with a lantern' held
high in the air. ! Behind him- was a man
covered with a black mask. I crowded
(back in my berth, thinking that I could
hide myself until he had passed, then
spring upon -him and throw him to the
floor. He was Just about to pass my berth
when he caught sight of my feet, which I
could not quite draw out of sight. He
turned, pointed his gun toward me and
said, 'Get out of bed. you fellow.' I
rolled from one side of the bed to the
other and yelled lustily, thinking I might
put people ahead of mo on their guard. I
thought that if any one was armed he
might take a shot at him while I was at
tracting his attention. The robber turned
half around and said to the brakeman:
'I hate like â --to kill anybody, but if
that don't roll out of there
and do as I tell him 1 will shoot him as
sure as .'
"I piled out. I wore a $150 solitaire dia
mond. The band of the ring was very
thin, so I turned the stone in between my
fingers and' he did not see it. On my mid
dle finger was a plain gold band bearing
a Masonic inscription. 1 handed him the
ring, saying that it was a present from
my mother. He read the inscription, then
he handed the ring back."
MORE TROUBLE OVER
CANADIAN BOUNDARY
Many Miners Now Fear That Their
Claims Are Located in British â¢
Territory.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Sept. : Z.â Many of the miners
of the Mount Baker mining district of
Washington are disturbed over the possi
ble shifting of their properties to the
Canadian side. American prospectors
'have located some of the most promising
properties In the district, supposing them
to be on the American side of the boun
dary line. The Canadian Government now
claims that the properties are on their
side of the line and are having a survey
made to determine the exact location of
the line.
The prospectors, not knowing for a cer
tainty on which side of the line their claims
lay, are locating them under the laws of
both countries. They were guided in mak
ing their original locations by a wooden
post which bore every indication of being
a boundary post. The Canadians claim
the line is about a mile farther south, and
If their survey sustains this contention
the United States Government will be
asked to make a survey.
The Department of the Interior is un
able to give any definite information In
response to the many inquiries received
on the matter for the reason that the re
port of the Boundary Commission making
the survey has not been found, and the
only record available is a map prepared
to accompany the report.'
From certain notes found, however. It
is believed that the monuments erected
by the commission were of iron and sMne,
which seems to indicate that the wooden
post referred to is not a boundary, post.
The loss to the, Americans, If It should be
proved th3t these mines are en the Cana
dian side, will be very large.

SAN JOSE. Sept. 13.â II. D. Copeland, a
student at Stanford University, was to
day committed to Agrnews asylum. He
was working his way through the uni
versity and overstudy and insufficient
nourishment, coupled with disappointment
in a love affair with a Stanford co-ed, the
doctors declare, are the causes of his
mental derangement. Copeland is a na
tive of Arkansas and 26 years of age. He
had been at the school about a year.
A. week ago the watchman found him
running around in the middle of the night
with a lighted candle In his hand. Since
his detention at the jail he has cut up all
kinds of caprices. The other night he dug
a hole^ through a brick wall .of '.hist- cell,
having scratched out the mortar with a
spoon. This morning he swapped every
stitch of clothing he had on with a hoy
prisoner two feet smaller in stature and
was togged out in . this abbreviated cos

Insanity is of a suicidal nature.

STOCKTON. Sept. 13.â "Who is the wo
man in the ea 3 e?" That is the question
now belns asked in the Mahony mys
tery. The news in the case to-day is in
regard to that letter. Sheriff Sibley tele
phoned from Tracy this morning in re
gard to it. The letter was received there
on September S.
On the 7th Mahony appeared at the
postofilce and asked the Postmaster if
there was any mall for him. There was
not. The Postmaster Identifies Mahony
by description as the deceased. The ail
dress of that letter Is in the handwriting
of a woman. It Is now in the hsoids of
the postal authorities.
The ofilccrs have received but little as
sistance from the family of the deceased
In thoir efforto to unravel the mystery.
The brother-in-law, Jlaass, who took the
remains back to San Francisco, promised
to write the District Attorney as to when
Mahony left San Francisco and such
other Information as might aid the offi
cers In their preliminary work. Up to
this evening not a line had been received.
"Who wrote the letter?" is now the
point of interest for the officers, and the
question will soon be answered. It is fur
ther hinted that they have struck a new
lead which may clear up the mystery.
The great sticking point against the mur
der theory is the total absence of motive,
but of course an investigation may bring
to liKht something of this nature.

In the Free-for-All Pace Anaconda
Defeats Prince Alert After
The Xatlonal Club -managers and all
concerned with the fight fiasco of
Wednesday night were in evidence yester
day in the haunts frequented by the prize
fighters and tight promoters â all save
Jack Moffatt, who Is nursing his dislocat
ed shoulder at the McNutt Hospital.
.Tommy Ryan was only too happy this
time to put in an appearance. Al Neill
was equally jubilant. Sam Pooler, Mof
fatt's manager, was neither sad nor gay.
J. D. Glbbs was decidedly lugubrious of
countenance and most -chary with his
tongue. J. J. Groom looked Injured and
was anxious to explain, but the willing
ears wero few. The patrons of the sport
who couldn't stay away spent most of the
day in calling themselves names and
painting menial pictures of â¢"burned"
money.
When the story is all told it .will be a
tale of mingled joy and sorrow. Tommy
ltyan. with a bunch of notes in his hand
for services rendered, is more than satis
fied, and Al Nelil's happiness is unbound
ed. His portion â J1250 â lor less than three
rounds of righting, a gift by the club
managers because they were suddenly
confronted with ruin, was the easiest
earning: that ever came Neill's way. The
'real sufferer Is Moffatt, but he derives a
little comfort from the $1250 that waa his
share.
Gibbs and Groom did not float on top of
the puddle. The purse, $2500, and the ex
penses will reach a higher figure than the
proceeds of the tight. There were some
people in San Francisco who took the wise
chance that Ryan would not fight as ad
vertised by the club managers. It was due
to this exercise of wisdom that the Na
tional Club fooled fewer people than its
; members expected.
: No forfeit money was claimed yesterday
by any of the parties concerned. Ryan
threatened a suit against the National
Club for the $500 forfeit for not allowing
him to fight, so a compromise was struck,
Â¦ neither party claiming anything from the
other. Pooler waived his claim of forfeit
money to Ryan and Ryan returned the
compliment to Pooler.
Tommy Ryan says he thinks so much
of San lÂ«"rancisco that he will remain here
for a year or two. Before he tries busi
ness again he will spend a few weeks at
some springs to regain his health. He is
most anxious to get another match. Mof
fatt will go to Chicago and rest for sev
eral montns.
In the excitement that came in the wake
of the three-round contest Pooler con
fessed to his agreement with Neill. that
the latter was not to be put out by Mof
fatt. Pooler now makea an amendment to
his original assertion. Instead of a prom
ise that me fight was -to go the full
twenty rounds Pooler has lopped off ten
of them. According to his afterthought,
Neill was only assured that Moffatt would
not force him into a ten-seconds lapse of
mind until ten rounds at least had ex
piied. Mr. Pooler shows signs of con
trition for having entered into this ne
farious bargain, and expresses heartfelt
regrets that he afterward exposed it. But
Pooler did not like the way Neill acted
when he rushed at Moffatt, helpless and
in great anguish, immediately alter the
accident.
The National Club has not yet an
nounced Its next fight.
Home Soon.
Will Return to His
esting.

One of the most enjoyable little dinners
of the season was held at . Marchand's
last evening. The guests of honor were
Captain Graham of the four-masted bark
Erskine M. Phelps, Captain Sewall of the
four-masted bark Edwfird Sewall. Cap
tain Amesbury of the Roanoke, the larg
est wooden ship afloat, and Captain Good
win of the Dirigo, the first steel sailing
ship built in America, while the host was
A. Chesebrough of the well-known firm of
AVllliams. Dimond & Co. . ,
The firm handles all of the Sewall fleet
and the fact that all these ships from the
famous yards at Bath. .Me... were in port
decided Mr. Chesebrough upon having a
little reunion. The result was the gath
ering at Marchand's. It will be remem
bered for many a day j by all who took
part In it.

The chances seem to bo against the
Newport getting out of quarantine for
some days to come. She got in he.re from
Panama and way ports on the 7th inst.
with a case of smallpox aboard. Yester
day she was to.be released, but one of the
pantrymen developed a case of fever and
the Quarantine officer detained the ship
in consequence. Until it is proven that
the steward's deputy has not the dread
disease the Newport will have to remain
in quarantine.
The big freight i steamer Algoa from
China via Hawaii was also in quarantine.
She will be released, novever, and dock
early this morning.
Still in Quarantine.
Another German transport, the Bosnia:
made port yesterday. AVhen the war was
on in China she was ordered here in a
hurry from Philadelphia and made the
run around the Horn In forty-seven days,
being only one day behind the record
made by the Alameda over fifteen years
ago.
The Bosnia belongs to the Hamburg-
American line and was loading at Phila
delphia for Europe when the news came
that China was in a state of Insurrection.
The German Emperor wanted horses and
he also wanted ships to carry them to the
scene of war. The horses he secured In
California and the ships were hurried here
from all parts of the world. The Alesia
came from Kobe, the Samoa from Mojie,
the Nurnberg from Kaiochau, and now
comes the Bosnia from Philadelphia. The
time made by all the vessels is remark
able when it is considered that all of them
are freight carriers. The Nurnberg came
from China in eighteen duys, the Samoa
from a remote port in Japan in twenty
days, the Alesla from Kobe in eighteen
days, while the Bosnia came around the
Horn in nearly record time.. Ail the ves
sels will be fitted out by the Risdon Iron
"Works and will carry the Kaiser's horses
now awaiting shipment from this city.
The Bosnia was built in 1899 by me
Palmers Co. (Limited) of Newcastle, Eng
land. She is 7-140 tons gross burden, 485
feet long, 57 feet beam and 32 feet 7 Inches
deep. In order to give these vessels all
the facilities possible the Collector and
Surveyor of the Port had a conference
yesterday with the Inspectors of Hulls
and Boilers. It was originally the inten
tion to pass these vessels without inspec
tion, but the Inspectors objected, as Uncle
Sam's vessels have all to pass before they
can leave for the Philippines. The matter
was referred to Washington, however,
and the chances are that the Alesia, Bos
nia, Nurnberg and Samoa will get away
from here on "rush orders." â¢

DOWNFALL OF
THE FAVORITE AT
SACRAMENTO
SACRAMEXTO. Sept. 13.â Governor's
<iay drew an immense throng to Agricul
tural Park to-day. His excellency Henry
T. Gage and staff, the latter in full uni
form, viewed the sport, which was by la:
the best of the meet, from the directors'
stand. The weather was balmy and warm
&r.d the spacious grandstand was crowd
ed with ladies and their Â«.-Â«-corts. The sen
sational feature of the lengthy card was
the CowcZall In the free-for-all trot of
r.atty and trim Dlone, 2:07*i. the over
whelming favorite. Oiarley Jeffries had
the daughter of Eros looking- at her best
end it was- supposed she would rub Dolly
Dillon ar.d Phoebe Childers, the only
other starters, off the board without ef
fort. In the early betting It was difficult
to get 4 for Deny and 3 for Phoebe
Chiiders against 2j tor the Spreekels
entry. Drawing the pole position, Dione
took the first heat in 2:1'.*^ like opening
a. clam, stepping to the half in I:u5*fc. The
second was a rej>etition of the lormer
heat, only thatitwas trotted slower, 2:12*4.
Then came the awakening for the short
enders. After leading Dolly I>Mon into
the stretch, I>ione btgan to wilt, losing
out to Dolly by a ie::gth la 2:12^. Not
withstanding the unexpected happening,
the friends of Dione kept her favorite at
tie rate of $30 io $ia over the other two.
In the fourth heat Dolly Dalon broke on
the back stretch. On the trip home Lap
ham came along with Pnoebe, simpiy
walking i.ast Dione. Jeffries rested nis
i:;a.re up to the rifi.ii heat to no avail, and
with Doliy cranky and uncertain Phoebe
Childers annexed two more heals and the
race.
Kelnsman Jeffries was much chagrined
ever the favorite's inexplicable slow
dov/n. as he supposed her capable of step
ping a phenomenally fast third heat.
Alter a tiresome gentlemen's road race
captured by Our Hoy, driven by E. J.
"vVe'don, had been decided. tnÂ« running
events were coiled.
The Capital City stake, at one mile and
a fi:rlor.g. a handicap, valued at Ja30, fur

the top weigmed favorite Formero pilot
ed by Ruiz, and El Mido, the former win

alternated in making the pace to the
stretch. Below the furlont pole there
was considerable bumping. Formero com
ing through and In a iurious drive having
hi? number suspended, lil Mido made a
phenomena] run the last tnree furlongs,
coming from last position. Vincitor, riu
6or. by Hennessy, had a most stormy
i'ii^sage.
The Sunny Slope stake for fillies, worth
$Â¦330. over rive furlongs, was the other
stake attraction. Getting away in the
lead and nearly knocking Bavassa down
in doing so, Maresa wilh J. McDonald up
Â¦won all the way. Bavassa came fast the
last sixteenth, losing the place by a nar
row margin to Moonbright. The wimit r

'^ASTERN papers are directing attention to the
fact that the announcement of the appearance
of bubonic plague in Glasgow has occasioned
no panic anywhere, not even in the British islands.
Considering how easily people are frightened in cases
of this kind/ the general indifference to the reports
from Glasgow is really a matter of some interest. It
marks a change in the temper of the public with re
spect to plague scares that is in the highest degree
gratifying. Even in the worst pestilences the scare
is more harmful than the pestilence itself and it will be
a benefit to civilization if such panics cease altogether.
If the subject be interesting in the East it is still
more interesting to Californians. for we have recently
had a plague scare, and the Glasgow case furnisher
us with a valuable object . lesson. The mere rumor
that bubonic plague had made its appearance in
Chinatown in this city caused a general quarantining
of the port and a spasmodic attempt at 'quarantining
the State. Why should there have been so much
flurry over the story of the plague here and no flurry
at all pver the definite and authoritative'announcement
that a considerable number of plague-stricken patients
have been found in Glasgow? .
The New York Times ventures the opinion that the
calmness and seeming indifference of the public to the
pestilence in the Scottish city is due to the 'fact that
so many sensationalevents are occurring elsewhere in
the worjd that the attention of the public is fully oc

rOLLOWING the exposure made b>' the wife of
Jim Corbett and the wife of "Kid McCoy" of
the swindles practiced by that precious pair of
pugilists in working the public that delights in prize
fighting there comes in this city a iake that ended in
i- surprise party for lhe fakers. The dupes who
bought tickets to see a fight between Jack Moffart
;md Tommy Ryan did not see it, and the schemers
who arranged to substitute Al Ncill in Ryan's place
and hive him knocked about by Moffatt for the
amusement of the deceived ticket-holders were up
against hard luck, for Moffatt's shoulder got a wrench
that put him out of the fight, and Ncill, who had
been signed to serve as a chopping-block, had the un
expected glory of a victory-
The proverb says: 'Though you pound a fool in a
mortar, yet will not his folly depart from him." The
fcol that supports the prize ring of these days is
surely of that kind. Over and over and over within
a time comparatively short have the "sports" of this
cily been duped by fake, fights so raw. so crude and
to flagrantly fraudulent that no one could have any
pity for the gang thai was taken in by them. Since
the notorious trick by which Wyatt Earp
rigged up a scheme to give Sharkey a vic
tory over Fitzsimmons there have been repeated
frauds committed upon the ring patrons of San Fran
cisco, and yet, with the gullibility of true suckers, they
were as ready to pan with their money on the latest
f?.ke as on the first.
No one can have sny pity for the dupes of- such
carries, but at the fame time it is not right that the
fakers should be permitted to ply their fraudulent
trade in the city. The police, which of late has been
so zealous in fighting ngainst poolrooms and side en
trances to saloons, ought to exert some energy in an
effort to break up th ; s swindling pug business. It h.15
become as gross an evil as any other of the time, and
should be suppressed as promptly as the force of the
An easy remedy ?.gair;?t the wrong is available to
the municipal authorities. No permit for holding
"boxing matches" should be permitted to any except
clubs composed of responsible persons and known lo
l>e genuine athletic associations. Under proper control
r.n<i management such sports may be conducted fairlv,
but ?.t present there U seemingly a free license for
any sort of fakers to get a so-called ."club" organized
with a membership of two or three persons and then
j.lay the public for all il is worth.
When lhe Corbett-. \?cCoy fight toolc place 1 -The
Call published a dispatch from New York denouncing
the affair as a fake. Most people thought they were
seeing a pood fight, and cur contemporaries described
the fake as one of the best exhibitions ever seen. One
nr two of the expert fporting editors and authorities
on prize-fights went into raptures over it. Now comes
the testimony of Mr>. Corbett and Mrs. McCoy de
nouncing the whole thing ?s a fake.
How long the fools will go on putting'up hard
earned money for such fraud"? and making themselves
"dead easy" for the pugs and pug managers it is hard
to say. Certainly they will do so too long for pub
lic patience. Therefore it is high, time for police in
terference. No such combination as that which has
so often run a fake nt-ht in San Francisco should
<vct be granted a license for another exhibition of
THE FOOL AND THE FAKING PUGS.
PRESIDENT WHEELER in calling to order
the promotion committee of the Pacific Com
mercial Museum, yesterday emphasized the need
of establishing .the museum and getting to work at
ence. Chairman Scott of -the executive finance com
mittee, in reporting that a sufficient number of mem
bers have been enrolled to assure an income equal to
the demands of starting the museum, added his coun
sel to that of the president and urged that immediate
steps be taken toward effecting a permanent organi
zation.
The spirit of the meeting was in harmonv with the
desire of the president and chairman of the finance
committee. The whole discussion tended to action.
President Wheeler was authorized to appoint a com
mittee to nominate candidates for the board of gov
ernors and to call a meeting of the promotion com
mittee and all the subscribing members as soon as the
nominating committee is ready to report. Mr.
Wheeler stated that he would appoint to that com
mittee men who will set promptly, and that if. they
fail to do so he would nnd out the reason why.
Thus the men who have for so long a time been
working upon the enterprise are now ready to launch
it. The arguments fov immediate action are many.
Until the museum is in operation it will not be possi
ble to prove its full value to the commercial commit-;
jiity. It is well understood that in a general way it.
will be of advantage, but merchants and manufac
turers are not yet clear in what specific manner it will
be serviceable to their particular business. That can
be demonstrated only by the practical working of the
institution. Consequently hardly much more in the
way cf support can bÂ« expected* until the museum is
established and has proven its worth by the' unmis
takable evidence of service rendered.
From what was accomplished at the meeting yester
day it is safe to say the inauguration of the museum
will tnke place in a comparatively short time. The en
terprise is in good shape and is moving rapidly for
ward. The Pacific Commercial Museum will soon be
an established institution of the city.
GETTING A MOVE ON.
The secreting of dead women in the side rooms of
saloons is. not likely to give any particular encour

gan a campaign of evasion. It refused to

to its lawyers. Beaten In the lower courts,
it appealed, and at last, at great expense,

VALENTIME'S FLOP.
BY the establishment of a college of commerce as
a branch of its educational work the University
of California set an example which has been
promptly followed. The New York Chamber of Com
merce is engaged in raising a fund for the endowment
of such a college at Columbia University, and it has
been .announced that the University of the City of
New York purposes to found another.
The fact that two such colleges are to be established
almost simultaneously in New York has naturally at
tracted the attention of the press, and the leading
papers are discussing with earnestness the new depart
ure in university life. It appears the two colleges are
to be widely dissimilar in the fcope of instruction and
the methods of giving it. The college at Columbia
will have a four-year course and will stand on a level
with the regular academic departments. The student
who enters will have to give his whole time and en
ergies to the studies just as if he had entered the
schools of law or medicine. The course at the Uni
versity of New York will be only two years and is to
be so arranged that young men engaged in business in
the city can attend it. â¢ It is said most of the lectu-es
and classes will be at night, and it is expected that
leading business men will encourage their clerks to
take the course.
The discussion of the project of the University of
New York has brought out the curious statement that
the business of the city, and particularly that of banks
and insurance offices, is sadly hampered by the lack
of competent accountants. One authority is quoted as
saying that no other cause contributes more to failu-es
in New York than bad bookkeeping. By reason of
this need the State Board of Regents was authorized
in 1896 to issue certificates to such persons as passed
examinations proving their fitness for public account
ants. Out of that law there has arisen the profession
of accountants, and thai object of the college to be es
tablished by the University of the City of. New York
is to afford students a means of fitting themselves
for it.
Some of the comments of the press upon the move
ment are interesting. The New York Post says:
"Among educators generally the admission of what
seems to be a business college as a department of a
university will cause surprise if not disfavor. Training
not for business but for life has been the watchword
of our so-called liberal education. * * * It seems
unfortunate that the newly established school is to
grant a degree of B. C. S. (bachelor of commercial
science), which will invariably suffer in comparison
with traditional degrees." /
t The Tribune takes a brighter view of the subject.
It says: "Preparation of young men for commerce,
for. banking and for other branches of business is to be
effected under university supervision just the same as
preparation for the practice of law or medicine. Busi
ness is practically made a learned profession. Or per
haps it would be more correct to say is recognized as
such. * * * The problems and operations of finance
in banking, insurance, accounting and what not are
to-day as elaborate and require as skilled a talent as
the operations of pure mathematics in De Morgan's
time. The old-time business methods are as much
out of date and as inadequate to present*business
needs as are the cottage loom, the tallow candle and
the stage coach."
The two colleges, working together but along dif
ferent lines, in New York- will of course materially
aid one another in more ways than one. Their very
rivalry will be a helpful stimulus. Our College of
Commerce will therefore have to receive generous
aid from local business men if it is to keep up with the
competitors that have started upon its track. We have
set the good example and we must now try to keep
the pace.
HIGHER COMMERCIAL TRAINING.
Whether the issue upon the stump be imperialism,

BIG WIND IN IRELANDâ O. L.. City.
A severe windstorm passed over Ireland
December 12, 1S22, but what ls known as
the "big wind in Ireland" was on the
night of January 6, 1839. On that night
there was an .awful hurricane on the west
coast of .England and Ireland. The storm
raged through Cheshire, Staffordshire and
"Warwickshire. Twenty persons were
killed in Liverpool by the falling 1 of build-
Ings and 10) were drowned In the neigh
borhood. The coasts and harbors were
covered with wrecks. In Limerick, Gal
way, Athlone and other counties more
than 200 houses were blown down and as
many more were burned, the wind spread
ing the fires. Dublin suffered very much.
London and its neighborhood sustained
scarcely any damage.
TRAVELING BY DAWK-Subscriber,
City. "Traveling by dawk" is a method
or traveling in India. It consists in post
ing by palanquin from station to station.
The traveler must first purchase a strong
palanquin. His clothes, with whatever
articles he may not immediately need, are
carried in tin boxes or wicker baskets
called pettarahs by separate bearers. At
the different stations, from nine to eleven
miles apart, there are relays of bearers,
previously provided by the postmaster,
the usual number for one palanquin being
eleven. All arrangements as to cost arÂ«
made with the postmaster of each presi
dency before Btartlng. but the traveler 13
expected to give the bearers at each sta
tion a gratuity consisting of about 25
cents among the entire set of bearers.
HONORS OF WAR-J. N. G., City.
When a besieged town has surrendered
and its garrison is permitted to march out
carrying their arms with them, with
drums beating and colors flying, they are
said to have capitulated with honors of
war. That is, they are understood not to
be conquered, but to be permitted to re
tire, with the privilege of continuing the
war elsewhere.
CREOLEâ K. O. T. M.. City. Creole Is
from the Spanish "criollo," properly,
nursed, grown upâ from criar, to breed. In
Louisiana. Spanish-America. West Indies
and Mauritius Creole denotes in Its widest
sense, any one born in the country, but of
a race not native to it. It is usually ap
plied, however, to persons born In the
colony or country, of pure European
blood, as distinguished from the offspring
of mixed blood. In Brazil it is applied to
a native, but of African parents.

barometer. Ascending from the sea level
the air becomes lighter and the mercury

to compute the elevation of the place.

GOVERNOR GAGE has appointed a committee
to act for California in raising money and sup
plies for the stricken people of Texas. The
committee is composed of I. W. Hellman, William
Alvord, Robert J, Tobin, Claus Spreckcls, James L.
Flood, A. A. Watkins, Charles Nelson and F. \V.
Dohrmann. The committee is vested with power fo
appoint additional members and subordinate com
mittees throughout the State. Thus an official body
is constituted for effective action: It is a genuine
State committee not designed for self-advertising and
not seeking to make a profit for itself out of the lib
erality of California and the distress of Texas.
Every State in the Union has been prompt to re
spond to the appeal for aid that has come from the
storm-swept district along the Texas coast. Califor
nia has been among the first and most liberal in re
sponding. The contributions of the people of this
city already amount to many thousands, and in the
dispatches notifying the Texas authorities that the
money has been forwarded there have been added the
cheering words '"more to come." Let that "more"
be forthcoming speedily. The need ot assistance is
urgent and imperative and immediate. Reports from
Galveston are to the effect that thousands of men,
women and children who were hurt by the storm will
die unless aid be given at once. A day of delay may
mean death, while instant help may mean restoration
to health and strength.
The terrible disaster has afforded the American
people one more opportunity for a display of their
abounding liberality. On^the day after the effect of
the storm was made known upward of $100,000 com
ing from all parts of the country was telegraphed to
the Governor of Texas as a first installment of the
generosity of the people. It is a large sum, but far
from being sufficient for the needs of the sufferers.
The relief committee of Galveston telegraphs: "We
have 25.000 people to clothe and feed for many weeks
and to furnish with household goods. Most of these
are homeless." That is the .situation Texas has to
face with the help of the rest of the nation, and cer
tainly that help should be neither illiberal nor dilatory.
California and Texas have had close historical re
lations. When the Texans struck for independence
they began the fight which led to the annexation of
California to the Union. It has been a strange
fatality that on the very night when in this city Cali
fornia began with joy and with festal decoration to
cclebrateÂ»the jubilee of her admission as a State the
storm descended upon Galveston and the Texas coast
and made a night and a day of such terror and de
struction as are almost unparalleled in history. From
our triumphant gladness we turn promptly to sympa
thize with their sorrow. Let every Californian in
proportion to his means give what he can. Let him
give it to-day, that the dying may have tender minis
trations and that those who are near to death may be
revived and cared for and saved.' ;

plague sufficiently to get frightened over it. The
Times says: k;^V Â¦ '
In the duller season, when the emotional section of the
press was on short rations as regards the only diet on
which it thrives, the outbreak at Glasgow would cer
tainly have been inflated into a peril of alarming propor
tions, and our health officials." instead of going
quietly about their business,; as now, would have been
forced to plve as much of their time to the allaying of
needless fears as to the providing of the necessary but
simple means of decreasing the likelihood of the disease's
introduction here and ot handling- and controlling it In
! the event a few cases do happen to be imported.
That there is something in that theory is not to be
doubted. When the report was sent out that bubonic
plague was in this city the New York Journal made a
sensational feature of it that was about the most
ghastly freak even that yellow paper ever produced.
Such publications excited the public mind and tended
to produce the scare that followed. Thus by con
trasting the temper in which the Glasgow cases have
been received with that in which the reports here
were taken throughout the country, we have a meas
ure by which to gauge some of the evil effects of yel
low journalism on the community.
There is, however, another point in the problem to
be noted. The Philadelphia Record attributes the
calmness of the public to the popular confidence in
the sanitary regulations at Glasgow and in the ef
ficiency of the work of the Board of Health. That is
an indirect condemnation of the Board of Health in
San FrancUco. It implies that Eastern people haa.no
confidence in our ability to clean Chinatown or to en
force health laws in that section of the city. In that
respect the East is not far wrong. Chinatown has
not been cleaned to ihis day. The ordinary sanitary
regulations of the city are not enforced there. The
owners of Chinatown property are not required to
obey the health laws and it is due to good fortune
more than to the Board of Health that we have no;
had pestilence among the Chinese.
San Francisco can thus learn two lessons from the
experience of Glasgow. The first is that yellow jour
nalism is dangerous and. the second is that an in
efficient Board of Health is of little value to a com
munity. We cannot suppress the freaks of the New
York Journal, but we might at least have a Board of
Health that would command the respect and con
fidence of the public.

They play musical instruments, hoarsely

form pyramidsâ in fact, do pretty nearly
everything but thread a needle and read
Shakespeare. Professor Lockhardt has
settled once for all the claim made by
some animal students that the elephant
Is the most Intelligent of all the wild spe
cies.
There are twenty-five elephants in this
herd, making it the largest in captivity.
The quickness of their movements In spite
of their mountainous burden of flesh Is
quite as puzzling as the almost human na

Bros, are justly proud of this item in their
list of circus values. In fact, the menag

of wild beasts in this department of the
circus. The lions. Users, deer, camels,

through as rapidly as possible, 'n ordev
that the museum, which Is declared on
all sides to be one of the most necessary

Enthusiasm was the keynote of the pro
ceedings and unity the spirit in which the
members aid under the gavel of Presi
dent Benjamin Ide Wheeler of the Univer
sity of California.
President Wheeler opened the proceed

necessity of going through the final steps
of organization as rapidly as possible. Ha
then state? that the object of tho meet
ing was to consider the best means of
electing the board of governors, to con
sist of twenty-one members. This he
thought could best be accomplished by a
nominating committee composed of. Saul
Sussman, F. \V7 Dohrmann, Lippman
Sachs, Arthur Kodgers and P, C. Rossi.
Irving JM. Scott then presented the
report drawn up by the executive com
mittee of the finance committee, of which
he is chairman. The report states that
up to date 178 firms have contributed to
the membership roll. This assures the
museum an income of $23,496 during the
llrst year of Its existence. Of this amount
$3662 77 has been placed to the credit of
the museum in the Bank of â¢ California,
representing 167 Initiation fees of $G0 each,
less the expenditures Incurred by the ex
ecutive committee In Its work. These ex
penditures have been kept as small as
possible and were incurred for printing,
postage, stationery, typewriting, etc..
amounting In all to $357 23. Eleven mem
bers owo in unpaid Initiation fees $6fiO.

SCENE 0E THE FIRST FIGHTING AHOUND TIENTSIN
AND SOME OF THE CRIPPLED SURVIVORS.
Colonel Robert L. Meade. with the aid
of maps and documents In his possession,
told an interesting story of the battle of
Tientsin. He took no credit for the splen
did work he did at the taking of the
walled city, nor did he throw bouquets
at the splendid corps of which he Is a
member. He was commanding officer of
the American forces at Tientsin. In ac
cordance with orders he landed in Tien
tsin with about 430 members of his regi
ment. The remainder of his command
was distributed over Manila.
"I arrived on the morning of the 11th."
he said. "It was 1 o'clock when we
reached the reservation on the outskirts
of the city. We went into action on the
Meade's Story of the Fight
ill with dysentery and is now at Yoko
hama.
Tho wounded on the Solace were at
tended by Assistant Surgeon J. Stepp. It
was due to his science and care that no
deaths were recorded during the trip.
Whrn the ship reached port last night
there was but one man in the "sick bay."
He had been the victim of a slight at
tack of smallpox, but is now entirely re
covered.
Dr. Stepp rendered splendid services to
the sick and wounded after the battle of
Tientsin. The men of the Ninth Regiment
and the marines and bluejackets who
were struck by the bullets of the enemy
attest to his ability. He worked night
and day with the stricken men and it
was due to his great efforts that the
seriously wounded of that battle are alive.
The berth deck of the Solace was turned
into a hospital. The wounded were laid
out on cots and mattresses and the young
physician, aided only by two nurtea ana
Hospital Stewards L. O. Schetky and F,
J. Bryant of Oakland, worked indefatig
ably among the men.
Dr. Stepp was at Taku on the 14th of
Auanst and was ordered to report to
Colonel Meade at Tientsin. He assisted
I^r. Norton, the chief surgeon in the fieid.
The wounded were cared for at the Im
perial Bank of Tientsin, which was con
verted into a hospital after the battie.
On the 20th of August Dr. Stepp returned
to the Solace with the wounded offlcerb.
Ho transported them in a Chinese junk,
lie stated last night that the result of the
operations performed on the soldiers was
excellent, owing to the climate. Wounds
healed rapidly and the men were soon
in a fair way to recovery. During the
next two days after his arrival on the
Solace the wounded were brought aboard
and the ship sailed to Nagasaki, where
the army officers and men were trans
ferred to the United States army trans
port Thomas. The marines and blue
jackets were taken to the Naval Hospital
at Yokohama and the ship with Its re
maining wounded came home.
"I reached my advanced position about
8 o'clock and we- remained there until 8
o'clock in the evening. I had 180 rounds
of ammunition with me, which was all
we could carry because the ground was
too poor for transportation. I also had
three three-inch rapid fire guns and three
Colt automatic guns. We remained in
the trenches until 8 o'clock, when we
were withdrawn to the mud walls, down
by the arsenal. We were twelve hours in
the trenches and our losses were pretty
heavy. I had five killed and twenty-two
wounded out of two companies. Captain
Davis was killed while standing between
Dr. Norton and myself. He was killed by
a 'jingair bullet, tired by a two-man
gun. Captain Davis was the only officer
killed, but a number were wounded, tap
tain Long was struck and my adjutant,
Lieutenant Leonard, was shot. Quarter
master Lemly and Lieutenant Butler were
both severely hit. Leonard lost his arm
and at one time his life was despaired of.
Butler returned to duty and I heard he
was shot, again.
"Butler was shot while trying to bring
in one of his wounded men who had gone
outvide the trenches. Leonard seeing his
brother officer's critical condition rushed
to his rescue and was himself wounded
wjille bringing Butler in. It was a very
gallant thing for both men to do, and de
served the high mention they afterward
received.
"About 2 o'clock on the monilng of the
14th the Japanese blew in the south gate
and we entered the city. There were very
few fighting men in the place and we en
countered no opposition. The city was
literally strewn with dead. The fire from
the guns of Captain Bayley wrought ter
rible execution. When we took posses
sion of the walled city it was divided Into
four parts. The Americans guarded the

ISth and fought all day. We started in
two columns from the reservation about
3 o'clock in the morning. The Japanese
were on the right and the English and
Americans on the left. We reached the
poutli gate of the walled city about 4:3U
o'clock, just as dawn was breaking. The
English battery, in command of Captain
Bayley of the royal navy, took up its
position and began to bombard the city,
while we waited under the mud wall.
On the day prior to the battle General
Dorward asked for a consultation of the
commanding officers and I notified Colonel
L-iscum, who was my Junior, to go with
me. A plan of action was determined on
by the commanding officer and Colonel
Liscum and myself thoroughly understood
it. On account of the few English in that
engagement Colonel Liscum's forces were
put on the right, while I, with the Royal
Welsh Fusileers, was on the left. About
7 or 7:30 o'clock on the morning of the
fight we deployed skirmishers and ad
vanced by rushes to., the front.
"In that country there are a great many
mounds and dykes and we used the latter
for trenches. The Chinese fire was par
ticularly accurate and rapid, and they
were armed with the best modern rifles.
At the turn of the last century life j
among the nobility was as brilliant and |
ceremonious as it was unutterably
wretched among the peasantry. Then,
too, the socialistic instinct, fostered by
the introduction of machinery and the
consequent advancement of the masses as
a power worthy of consideration among
the classes, began to make itself felt
throughout Europe and America. In Eng
land embers from the French revolution
burned into the minds of the people, mak
ing them restless with a sense of injus
tice and a need of political privileges.
Passion for progress seethed beneath the
high tory ministries, breaking forth au
thoritatively upon the death of Lord Cas
tlereagh, whose blind conservatism had
made him a conspicuous if not popular
figure in England's history until 1822. The
revolutionary infection spread even to the
Spanish colonies in Mexico arid South
America, to which infant republics many
looked for redress from the irregularities
of the Old World.
Bonaparte took up his residence in the
Tuileries in 1800. After his downfall the
holy allianceâ undoubtedly formed for the
purpose of stamping out the principles of
liberty universally aroused*by the French
revolutionâ began the parceling out of
Europe and so changed its map that it
would scarcely have been recognizable to
the politicians of the late seventeenth cen
tury. In France emigre and bourgeois
touched elbows In their efforts to restore
what each chose to denominate the old
regime. Spain's tendencies toward liber
alism, as evinced in her frantic efforts to
secure a constitution, were to be nipped
in? the bud by an Invasion of French
troops. Prussia, still resting upon the
traditions of Frederick the Great, was
most insignificant in the family of na
tions which had struggled against Napo
leon. Italy, as punishment for her con
cessions to the "man of destiny," was
placed under the hated domination of
Austria, England, which was* not recog
nized among the great European powers
until the treaty of Paris in 1763, entered
about 1S22 upon the policy of progress for
which she has since become so distin
guished. In America, whose customs and
usages were frequently but pale reflec
tions of foreign thought, the new radi-<
calism fell upon unusually fertile soil.
There were but few class distinctions left
to abolish, but America did what she
could. The customary burlesque upon.the
English way of ranking by pedigree,
which during the early coloni; '. days had
been such a serious rule of caste at Har
vard College, was straightway done away
with. The title of "mister." originally an
honorary term, was applied so indiscrimi
nately that great men were only to be dis
tinguished by the absence of all title. Ap
! prentices thenceforth discarded their
leather aprons and breeches in favor of
second-hand suits of their employers,
while the maid servants spurned the short
j gowns and petticoats of domestic manu
tacture, by which clumsy livery they had
oeen readily recognized whenever they
went abroad. As a result of this equaliz
ing tendency all the early Republicans
seemed to live upon the same general
plane of prosperity, so that when Lafay
ette paid us one of his triumphant visits
he exclaimed in bewilderment, "But
where are the people!"
The political and social movements
which became such noteworthy features
of the nineteenth century necessarily af
fected society in all Its branches. In Eng
land the various commercial, manufactur
ing and philanthropic reforms incident to
the early part of the century ameliorated
social conditions, sandwiching the in
creasingly substantial middle class be
j tween the brutish masses and the uppor
i conservative classes. Prominent among
I the overturning forces of the new century
was the invention of the cotton gin by the
j American, EM Whitney. England had
previously invented the steam engine and
an ingenious machine fcr - spinning and'
was- anxious to divert to her markets the
cotton from our Southern plantations.
The crops, however, were most unproflt
| able because of the tenacity with wh'ch
the cotton adhered to the fiber. After
many experiments Ell Whitney, encour
aged by Mrs. Green of Revolutionary
memory, devised a clumsy machine which
could perform the work of hundreds of
men. In it thel planters foresaw those
possibilities of untold wealth which thoy
eventually realized, "fn that rude log hut
of Georgia," says Barnes, "cotton was
crowned king and a new era was opened
for America and the world."
In England this invention brought about
a state of affairs not easily comprehended
by the conservative manufacturers. Re
senting the abolition if the hand looms
worked bv Â¦weavers in their cottagea ns
described in George Eliot's "Silas Mar
ner." tho people bitterly opposed the inno
vations of machinery, succumbing even
tually because compelled to do so by their
employers, and perceiving dimly that the
new contrivances wout-.i give employment
to thousands where one would have for
merly made a llvlnp. The masses were
next ground between the wheels of com
petition. Early In tho century manufac
turers desirous of making large profits by
means of cheap labor threw men out of
employment and took on women and
children to tend their looms. For a Ion*
time the public conscience was hardened

to the fact that pauper children were sent
by the bargeiul to the manufacturing
towns, where they died rapidly or were
crippled for life. Tlia employment of
women through long, weary hours in a
polluted atmosphere led to pernicious re
sults In the breaking up of the home* in
destroying parental affection and in dead

'ine conditions under which factory

intans ideal, in many instances are most
deplorable, dui compared with the iabor
ol a century ago they are models of In
dustry. Much of the change may be at
tributed to the various combinations for
mutual improvement and the tremendous
spread of socialism, that strong under
current toward the co-operation of capi
tal and labor which is broadening out into
one of the mighty streams of the twen
tieth century. How It shall be managed
is one of the gravest problems confront
ing the present generation.
'ihe strong light of public sympathy was
turned upon the piteousness of child labor
by Lord Ashley, who did for the little
ones of England what Wilberforce did for
the blacks. Heartbreaking stories of the
four-year-old workers in the coal mines
dragging on all fours sledges fastened to
their waists by chains were published In
reports of parliamentary commissions;
and Ashley's earnest speeches In Parlia
ment finally aroused the public sympathy,
although it took twenty long years for
tha: sympathy to find legal expression.

"The Cry of the Children." in these days
of ameliorated conditions for the working
classes it is customary to decry this noble
poem as maudlin or sentimental, and the
same terms are ignorantly applied to the
searchlights which Dickers turned upon
the dark places of cruelty wherein the
chimneysweep, the boj*3 of thp workhouse,
factory and Yorkshire schools led their
cramped and painful lives. It is Interest
ing to iearn that the chain of benevolence
in which the names of Wilberforci.-, Ash
ley, Mrs. Fry, Southey, Mrs. Browning
and Dickens form such important links
has been continued in our days by Lady
Burdett-Coutts, whese sympathies Dick
ens enlisted in the work.
In America the children of the family
of moderate means in 1S00 led far more
comfortable lives. Child life In the newly
puttied country whese development drew
heavily upon all its resources was held
at a hipher valuation. From this has de
veloped the "1'ounK America" of 1300.

With all the increased valuation put %

At the portals of tho eighteenth century
giants in literature were imperiously
knocking, clearing the way for the horde
of writers, grave tr.rt say. prolific and
I poetic, humorous* and historic, which Is
to-day in easy occupancy. On the Conti
nent great authors were at thfa time con-
I spicuous by their absence. In "France the
skeptical writers for a time held an unen
viable and transient sway. Goethe was
living, but his writings belong, with Schil
ler's, to tho close of the preceding cen
tury. England felt the powerful Influence
J of the French eycloperllsts and German
I metaphysicians, and the stamp of their
i power is plainly traceable in the writing
of Scott. Wordsworth. Coleridge. Southey.
Moore, Shelley and Byron. Karly in thÂ«
century Scott charmed the world With his
minstrelsy, and a few years later he wrote
"his way out of debt.
At the beginning of tho nineteenth cen
| tury American literature was but an an-
I nex to that of England, drawing from
Sydney Smith the contemptuous query.
"In the four quarters of the globe, who
reads nn American book or goes to an
American play, or looks at an American
picture or statue?" Washington Irving

James Fenimore Cooper, and to-day even

ICEW YORK. Sept. 13.â Business ln general
New York Stock Market.
NE^v- YORK. Sept. 13.â So far aa the stock
market can be relied on as a mirror of general
condition the country remains plunged in pro
found doubt and uncertainty. The few move
ments of prices are little more than ripples on
the surface of a stagnant pool. Members of
the Stock Exchange are quite nonplused. Both
tfcat class who operate on their own account
known as room traders, and the comm.sslon
bouses are puzzled over the Immobility of the
market. The stocks in which any appreciable
movement occurred to-day were dealt in to ho
small an extent as to detract from the sig
nificance of the changes. The coalers showed
some sharp declines. Lackav.-anna losing 2*
points, -while Reading first preferred and New
Jtisey Central were down at one time to about
a point, but partly recovered. The declaration
of a strike in the Pennsylvania anthracite coal
region had a depressing effect on the general
market, as the contest inaugurated is felt to be
fraught with vast possibilities of harm. Somf
depression was reflected from foreign ex
changes. London showing uneasiness over the
ikelihood of the railroad strike. The leading
incident of the day in the financial world was
the easing of the private discount rate in Lon
don in n-aponse to the large additional re
cuperation shown by the Bank of England.
1 he sterling exchange rate fell sharply in New
lork. Paris and Berlin as a consequence an
advance ln the Berlin discount rate helping
thÂ« movement. The London market was appar
ently undisturbed by the Stock Exchange set
tlement and the 25 per cent installment falling
ou* to-morrow on the subscriptions to the
RrltiBh exchequer bonds. This leaves half of
the subscription jet to be met. The general
a ?? ls ?i? n ,J hat a GÂ«rman loan to the extent
of $25.tÂ«o 000 is to be placed in New York gives
additional Interest to the effect of the remaining
installments to be paid by American sub-
Ecribers to the British loan. It is a safe as
sumption that a liberal proportion of the Ger
man loen will have to be met by gold ex
ports.
The bond market continued devoid of Inter
est. Total sales, par value. $710,000

Fruit and Salmon in London.
â¢ The London Grocers' Gazette of August 25
Fays: In Callfomlan fruits there is no fresh
feature. California^ packers have already de
clared a delivery of 75 per cent on their con
tracts for pt-ars. The salmon market has been
In an excited condition during the week and
a further considerable advance has been estab
lished, ltfith for i-almon un the spot and for
forward dt-iivery- This has been c&ured by a
maaiijT increased consumptive demand anj
the confirmation of the news that the pack ot
Krascr Kiver will certainly be a very email
ore. net more than to 160,000 cases, or
loss than one-third of the 1S9S pack. Alaska
in expected to t* a full pack, but the partial
failure of tbe Pucet- Sound pack will ca.uÂ»e
moi-e Alaska to be taken for consumption iu
the United States.
Condition of Trade.
The New Tork circular of Henry Clews fays:
"The general eituation has presented some
Â«*5;>eciaJ features of interest during the week.
The very large purchaÂ«s of 300,000 pieces or
cotton goods by a well-known manufacturer
indicates 6trong faith in the maintenance at
leasft of prevailing prices in that line. This
action relieved a condition of â¢ affairs ln Fall
River that threatened to result ln a curtail
ment or wages of operatives, besides showing
that the market for these goods Is pafsir.f
into strong hands. In addition to and perhaps
aÂ» ln part a cor^piement of this a large ad
vance in the price of cotton Itself has taken
pla.ee. In such proportion as to enhance the
actual value of the present crop by at leaet
thirty jnillior.* of dollars. Such accretions of
vaJuoB are apt to furnish potent argument*
egtt:nÂ«t a reversal of national policy. The
nock market has been nomewhat Etlmulateo
by the Vermont election returns, but Wall
ctreÂ«*t seems to show a little more disposition
to await the later developments of the cam
paign Iwfore inaugurating any pronounced
movement. Railway earnings ccnf.r.Hi- to be
gratifying to both shareholders and the gen
iral busiTieM community and money remain*
fn abundance. The movement of currency for
trop moving purposes Is a little late !n be
#rinnSnE and ought not to Influence money rat's
to any great degree in the absence of any
further export* of gold to Europe. This lat
ter movement is among the possibilities later
on. although the weakness of eteriing exchange
at the moment precludes Its immediate like
lihood. The heavy expenses under which the
Brltlfh empire Is earryln* on Its various mili
tary operations may conduce to " the flotation
of iLDOther exchequer loan later on. In which
New York financiers would most likely be In
vited to participate. These are possibilities to
be reckoned with in any prognosis of the course
of the market, which la the light of recent
reports from Â«J1 over the country has a founda
tion of permanent prosperity on which to rest."

London Market.
NETW YORK. Sept. 13.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The public utterly failed to follow the lead
given yesterday in the markets here, conse
quently a general reaction set ln to-day. Busi
ness was unimportant in volume. Restraining
influences were fears of dearer money and
of trouble In China and the railway labor war.
The announcement that a strike had been or
dered in the coal regions depressed Americans
and there Is some inclination among the mar
ket leaders here to believe that the strike will
prove a fizzle. Money closed hard and Berlin
discounts were up. The bank received Â£5000
gold in bars. Silver was higher on Calcutta
buying, believed here to be buying ln of ba
zaars by the Indian Government. The bazaar
I'rlce was 74.

CHICAGO. Sept. IS. â Wheat was strong
through the session and trade generally was
animated. October opened V4@%c higher at
74?4Â©74%c and easily advanced to 75%c. Higher
cables from Liverpool and light Northwest re
ceipts were the principal factors. Later heavy
export sales were reported and the market ral
lied sharply, October to 75Tfcc, which was also
the closing quotation.
Corn started weak, for although the opening
was higher a dip followed immediately, the
bears selling In imitation of the elevator In
terests. The cash business caught the market
and a sharp rally followed. Wheat strength
was also a help. "October closed %c higher at
39Hc.
Oats followed corn. October closed V&OUc
higher at 21%&22c.
A large run of hogs had a depressing effect
on the provision market. There was some re
covery from the bottom on the grain strength
and the close was steady. October pork closed
6c lower, lard 2^Â®5c down and ribs 2VÂ»c de
pressed.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

One of the trustees of the Astor estate

financial statue. He said she has an an
nual income of $50,000 from a trust set
aside by her h-usband. and. in addition,
she enjoys a large annual Income from
her son's estate. The securities set aside
to provide the $50,000 a year have been so
remunerative that there is a large sur
plus, and the friendly suit lately begun
was to determine what was to be dona

Rev. Herbert S. Blgolow of Cincinnati
spoke la*t night at Metropolitan Temple
upon the subject. "Stealing' as a Fine
Art." The San Francisco Singl* Tax So
ciety bad the affair in hand and a large
audience listened to a very interesting ad
dress. Mr. Blgelow said that one way of
getting money without earning- it was to
take advantage of some unjust law which
confers the legal privilege of robbing our
fallow men. He said lhat the kind of ex
pansion he believed In was that of taking
the tax off Industries and placing it on
the lard so as to make it unprofitable to
hold the land out of usÂ»e. The Declaration
of Independence applied to Industrial con
ditions, he believed, would brine more
glory to the old flag than all the islands
of the p^as.

WASHINGTON. Sept. 13.â Since the
vessels were placed in commission several
months ago 200 enlisted men have deserted
from the battleships Kearsarpre and Ken
tucky. This unusual number of deser
tions has caused considerable comment in
naval circles. It is ascribed by official?
to the fact that the vessels nre new and
that the glamor which once existed rela
tive to naval service has disappeared An
encouraging feature about the matter is
the fact that only two of the deserters
were men who had been enlisted as lands
men and were trained under the system
adopted upon the recommendation of Rear
Admiral Crowninshield. The department
is obtaining highly satisfactory results
from this system and it is said the men
who are educated men-of-warsmen render
excellent service.

The third and last match of the crick

Tuesday against Lake County and ended
in an easy victory for the team from San
Francisco. Lake County won the tcss
and sent the visitors to the wickets. The
inning? opened disastrously for San Fran
cisco. R. B. Hoguc C P. Coles and J.
Myers losing their wickets in rapid fuc
cettloa for only one run. But F. Croll
and E. O. Sloman came to the rescue, the
former scoring- 87 and the latter 23. Cae
j=My follow<?d with 1% and the inninrrs
closed for the respectable total of 11M

Lake Oour.ty had great hopes of passing
this total, but Knderby fell to a brilliant
catch by Croll. and Keeling was bowied
!;. Fnrtmann, the board showing only
seven runs. The remaining batsmen fell
quickly to the bowling of Oasidy and
Portmann. the former capturing seven
w:Â«-kÂ»-?Â« for 14 runs=. The n>lding of the
cl:y Lean was very grood and the country
batsmen manajrrd to compile only 35 runs.
San Francisco then began a second in

making 20 ar.d Eloman 35. The match,

AFTER nn absence of several years
Ada Lewis, "the Tough Girl," has
returned home to San Francisco.
She went East with Harrlgan 'way
back in 1892 and her rise to fame Jn por
traying the "Bowery girl" was Instan
taneous.
Her visit to San Francisco la rather a
sad one. as she lost her husband, John
Parr, formerly barytone with the Do
Wolf-Hopper company, who died in New
York on the 23th ult. Miss Lewis Imme
diately settled her business ajid started
for San Francisco, hoping the Right of
fresh scenes and new faces might dispel
the dark shadow that had just clouded
her young life.
"I do wish you would write just any
thing," she said yesterday In an Inter
view. "This reminds me of when I first
went to New York. I never know just
what to say to a newspaper man. Well,
I left here in 1S02 and went Kast with
Edward Harrigan, after he had received
my mother's consent to go. I first ap
peared In 'Relily and the 400.' They told
me that I made a hit in the part. It
seemed awfully funny to rise in the pro
fession so quickly. When I was home here
In San Francisco I used to go on as a
walking lady in swell ballroom scenes
and the only parts I used to enact were
nearly all thinking ones. Once In awhile,
I remember, I used to buttonhole Mark
Thall on the corner and coax him into giv
ing me a small speaking part. My hus
band died recently and I could not like
stopping in New York and wanted to
come borne and here I am."
Miss I.o\v;k will fill a short engagement
at the Alcazar and will open next week
in the soubrette role of "The Widow's
Husband." At the close of the second act
she will as a specialty portray "the
tough girl" that made her famous.
PRICE'S APPEAL
DENIED BY THE
POLICE BOARD
Motion to Expunge the Rec

Tomer I/ieutenant's Attorneys Will

Compelling Recognition
by the Board.
The Police Commissioners last night de
cided not to restore Sergeant William
Price to the rank of lieutenant. On April
1&. is?3, the old Board of Police Connate
Eloners disrated Price without giving him
a chance to defend himself against
chargve of corruption and intxmipetency
wfc-.ie in charge of the Chinatown squad.
Thinking he had been unjustly treated
Price, through his attorneys. Dunn &
Black, appealed to the pr*-s*-nt board to
iis-vfc the order of the old board disratlr.g
mm rescinded. La.Â«u night the matter was
brought up by Commisisoner Wallace.
After briefly referring to the case the
*. ommlfsioner made a motion to the eft'ec:
tnat the resolution of the ex-board dls
rMinp Price be ftricken from the records.
Commissioner Mahcney seconded the mo-
Uon. On rolloall McNutt ar.d Mahoney
voted "no" and Wallnce and Xewhali
"aye." Chairman Newhall then an
r.ounced, as it w;is a tie vote, the motion
was lost.
In votir.gr against the motion Commis
sioner Mahoney paid that if it was adopt
ed Price would have the right of action
fagair.s; the city for hack pay. For that
reason he was opposed to Interfering with
th.r action of the old board.
Commission* r McNutt thought that the
board had no ri^ht to Fettle the question
rs to whether or noi Price was disrated
for cause. He was ratlsned that Price
was an effle'ent officer, but he did not
th!r-k that the Commissioner* hid thÂ«
r:grht to restore him to nts former rank.
Attorney Dunn then announced that he
v.ould at once apply to the courts to com
pel the Commissioners to recognize the
cieim of the dis=trated officer.

WOULD EXCLUDE
AFFLICTED GIRL
FROM SCHOOL
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
111S Broadway. Sept- li
Fruitvale school district has taken the
Initiative in the matter of excluding from
the public schools those children who
from some mental deficiency are unable
to successfully compete with their fellow
scholars.
There was an exciting session of the
Fruitvale board last evening when the
Trustees considered the proposition to
suspend Cella. the 12-ypar-old daughter nf
Charles Jackson, a Fruitvale business
man. because she is afflicted with a form
of epilepsy. The only objection to the
rhiUl romainirg in school was that when
attacked with convulsions she disturbs
the other pupils. In tu-r studies she Is as
i-apable as any membt-r of her class.
Charles Jackson, father of the little girl
to proscribe whom an effort is being
made, appeared before the board and
raised his voice in strenuous objection to
the threatened action of expulsion. He
arRued that CeHa was bright mentally,
except during the short spells of epilepsy
which occasionally overtook her. Her at
tendance was regular and her report
cards showed that as a student she held
her own with the rest of her class. He.
said that there was no law which em
powered the board to take such action as
threatened, and If his child was not al
lowed the privileges of the other children
nf the district he would retain attorneys
to defend his position.
The Trusteesâ W. S. Dunlevy. J. F.
Kiley and William Bridge, were uncer
tain of their stand, and sent for Chief
Deputy District Attorney Phil M. Walsh.
Mr. Walsh was unprepared to render an
opinion off-hand, and nsked for time in
which to look up authorities.
The appearance of the District Attorney
and the apparent desire of the Trustees
to leave the matter in his hands did not
satisfy Jackson. He Insisted upon know
ing- what was poing to be done.
""We mijrht seat the little one near the
door of her room and when one- of her
spasms attacks her she could be removed
without disturbing the rest of the class."
suggested Trustee Dimlevy. "This could
be tried for a month, and if the parents
of the other children still objected we
could then take steps to exclude Mr. Jack
son's little girl. Mr?. Shirk, the principal,
objects to the present order of things, and
the child's teacher. Miss Ida TIammond.
has put up with a great deal. Still, in the
face of all this, we should be lenient and
not take snap judgment. The child Is un
fortunately afflicted and is entitled to ev
*>ry consideration. I supsest that no ac
tion be taken until wo have an opinion
from the District Attorney."
After this statement by Trustee Dun
levy. Jackson still insisted on having the
matter disposed of at once. Â¦-
"I pay taxes in this district." he said,
"and my daughter will receive instruc
tions from Fruitvale School If It is the
tight of my life. I emphatically deny your
rierht to shut her out."
The little pirl was also In attendance.
She was Questioned by the members of
the board and showed the Intelligence of
the average child of her age. She seemed
extremely sensitive on the point of her af
fliction.
According to the Board of Trustees, a
number of letters were received from pa
rents of children In Cella Jackson's class
objecting to her presence In the room
their children were compelled to occupy
Jn receiving their education.
Deputy District Attorney Walsh Is of
the onlnlon that Cella Jackson could be
excluded from the school if her presence
was obnoxious to others. He will report
to the Board of Trustees within a 'few
days. .;Â¦-

Ingleside Coursing Association Will
Run a Sixty-Four Dog Stake
On Sunday Next.
CARD FOR SAN MATEO
PARK IS A STRONG ONE
The so-called agreement or contract en
tered into between the Ingleslde and
Union Park Coursing associations has evi
dently failed to satisfy all concerned, as,
after living up to its cerms (or an inning
and a half, thu associations have agreed
to disagree.
At the time of the consolidation it was
given out that the parks would alternate
so. far. as dates were concerned: that is.
Union Park would run for four weeks and
Inglesidc'for three, and that during the
Inning of one park the other should re
main eloFed.
Soon after the big park commenced its
second aeries a strung tip went out that
It wua the intention of the management
to have continual coursing, notwithstand
ing the fact that the other association
objected to the programme. Then came
the story that r.o contract or agreement
had ever been signed, and that the only
"understanding" between the two clubs
was that the proposition of alternate
dates be given a trial In the interest of
the sport.
Later on ;he Union Park people de
clared their intenticn of remaining open,
claiming that there was business enough
for both parks and that coursing men
demanded the keeping open of both places.
This of course was not to the liking of
the Ingleside directors, though they made
no effort to Join in until the Union Park
had violated what the Ingleside people
termed a plain contract.
While the San M^iteo people admit that
no contract was signed, they ciaim that
the agreement was in effect inasmuch as
the Union Park has lived up to its terms.
Those interested in the Inpleslde Club
have not done much talking, but have had
the matter In the hands of attorneys for
some time.
The Ingleside Association has declared
its intention to apply to the courts for an
order to force the Union people to live up
to the "veVbal" contract and prevent them
violating the agreement which calls for
the closing of the one park during the
Inning of the other.
Claim That the Verbal Contract
Which Was Recently Agreed
Upon Is About to Be
Violated.

Giant Tree Reduced to Splin
ters by the Discharge
How the Force Is Exercised Consid
ered in Its Bearings on the
Utility of the Con
ducting Rod. *
The Oswego Times describes a recent
exhibition of the rending power of light
ning at Hagerstown, Ind., and speculates
concerning the tremendous force exer
cised. A few days ago lightning struck
a white oak tree at Hagerstown and scat
tered it, roots and all, to the four winds.
The tree was growing in the open, and
was well nourished, being three feet In
diameter and having a spread of nearly
100 feet. After the lightning had riven it
the fragments were so broken that they
could be gathered in all directions over a
space of hundreds of feet from the tree.
The bolt must have passed through the
heart of the oak.
The Times says of the lightning stroke:
"The action of electricity on a tree or
limb filled with sappy moisture seems
more at times in the nature of an explo
sion of some force inherent within, ig
nited as powder or gas is ignited, than a
force smiting the object from without. It
would seem impossible that any mere
blow could have produced the effect on
tha oak referred to. -And like effects, if
not so extreme, are not uncommon."
Although the Times is not specific it
may be more accurate than the Russian
Investigator who decided that the rending
force, of lightning was due to steam sud
denly generated by overpowering heat,
from the sap of the tree. Carrying out the
suggestion oL the Times, of an explosion
of some forc# Inherent within, it might be
that the lightning stroke separated the
water of the sap into its gaseous elements,
oxygen and hydrogen, and exploded them
at once.
The difficulty of these theories is that
lightning rends the perfectly dry timbers
of buildings and cuts brick chimneys as
though / they had been struck by a can
non shot at close range. It often happens
that the corner of a chimney is taken off
by lightning, leaving the rest of the struc
ture intact. The bricks are broken instead
of being loosened from place. So there
much be some rending force other than
steam or exploding gases. Steam or the
gases of water may have their part in the
destruction of a tree, but steam or the
gases of water do not wholly explain the
breaking force of lightning.
We have heard of straws being driven
through boards in a tornado. Light bodies
going with an inconceivable velocity have
a disrupting force out of all proportion
to their weight. .The lightning spark must
be a physical entity, having an incon
ceivable velocity, to rend a brick chimney.
It cuts through the brick as a snark from
an electric pen cuts through a sheet of
paper.
An electrical discharge from the clouds
of the earth indicates high tension. Recent
investigators of the utility of lightning
rods have directed their inquiries to the
behavior of the spark in discharges from
the clouds. They conclude that the spark
goes to the earth with such velocity that
a point sticking up here and there has but
little influence. For this reason they
argue that the lightning rod cannot pro
tect at all. The ordinary laws of con
ductivity in low-tension currents do not,
in their view, apply to sparks from the
clouds. The Electrical Review says:
"We know that lightning is the dis
charge of an enormous condenser of
which the clouds and the earth are plates,
and of which the electrical capacity is
simply enormous. The volume of the av
erage â¢ discharge of lightning is probably
not very large as compared with the
heavy currents used in electric lighting
and railway work, but the nearest ap
proach that has been made to measure It
indicates that it is of the order of a thou
sand amperes, more or less. Since the
discharge is almost Invariably either a
sudden rush or a violent electrical oscil
lation, the ordinary laws governing elec
trical conductivity do not control, its
actions, and it is necessary to look to the
phenomena of high-tension and high-fre
quencv discharges in order to understand
what may be expected from a lightning
stroke."
Following this extract the Review ad
mits that there are discharges which may
pass peacefully ddVn a lightning rod and
enter the ground. Perhaps the Review is
too sweeping in its conclusion. If the or
dinary laws of conductivity did not apply
in the case of lightning there would be
little need of lightning arresters on tele
phone lines and other lines. Lightning
often touches a trolley line nnd follows it.
and it is now a rule to take the trolley
from the wire in nn electrical storm to
prevent the destruction of motors. So the
Review tries to prove too much. Lightning
is often conducted for a considerable dis
tance by telegraph wires, part of the
charge seeking the earth through the
poles and shattering several in rotation.
So it would seem that a pointed wire in
the Pky with direct connection with the
earth may be of some service.'
A lightning rod Is much like any other
precautionary measure; it may be needed
badly, or not needed at all. Under the
doctrine of chances a man who has a trap
door in his house is likely to fall through
it at some time In his life. Therefore the
trapdoor should be sternly abolished. If
the danger from lightning can be partly
avoided an effort may well be made in
that direction, if itjs not too costly.â

No Evidence From Europe.
Judge Troutt has denied the application
of the executors of the will of the late
Julius Friedman to send a representative
to Europe to uecure evidence to prevent
possible succesa of the contests to the
testament which have been filed. The
executorsâ William Alvord, Edward L.

in their opinion no relatives or others en
titled to succeed to decedent's estate, or a

Troutt held that this proceeding would
unnecessarily burden the estate, and de
nied the application. An exception to the

THE GREAT EXCURSION
TO SANTA CRUZ
The friendly relations hitherto existing
between her imperial Majesty's British
empire and United States Secret Service
Agent George W. Hazen have become
seriously strained, and there is likely to
be an open rupture between the two.
Acting British Vice Consul Moore Is
blamed by Chief^ Hazen for the combined
comminuted fracture of the diplomatic
entente.
"He wanted to put me on a level with
a British constable;" said Chief Hazen
yesterday. "I had been engaged by the
British Government to take Julian Tre
gcnnaÂ«Blddulph Arnold to London,- and
now. Mr. Moore says that I must travel
second class, because the British con
stabulary travel that way. I am a little
higher than a British constable, and t
told him so. My district embraces the
States of California, Nevada and Arizona,
which cover territory three or four times
larger than the whole of England. Sec
ond class, indeed!"
Chief Hazen took an active part in the
capture'of- Arnold and earned the grati
tude of British Consul Plckersglll. The
Consul suggested to the British Embas
sador at Washington that Chief Hazen
should be selected to take Arnold back to
London, and the British Embassador re
quested Chief Wilkie to give Chief Hazen
the necessary permission. It was given
and Chief Hazen had his wardrobe packed
in readiness for a hurry start as soon as
the. extradition order was issued by the
Secretary of State.
When United States District Judge de
Haven dismissed -the writ of habeas cor
pus a few days ago Chief Hazen spoke to
"Vice Consul Moore about the trip. Then
the Vice Consul made the shocking re
mark about the second-clas3 passage and
the British constabulary. Chief Hazen re
plied that he was no second-class man â
that the United States Government did
not. expect its officials to travel second
class and that he would. go first class or
not at all. A day or two later Mr. Moore
agreed that Mr. Hazen might ride in a
Pullman from San Francisco to New York
and that the prisoner would be taken from
that port to England by two constables
from Scotland Yard. Chief Hazen replied
that he would go as agent clear to London
if he went at all, and he gave Mr. Moore
notice that the "Incident was closed" so
far. as he- was concerned.
So, after all, the English girls will not
have an opportunity cf admiring the curl
ing mustache of the secret service agent.

WILL NOT BEND
TO BOSS YOKE
There Js a chance in politics for honest
men to get their dues, for, strange as it
may seem, the bosses have fallen out.
The henchmen of Burns are reviling Mar
tin Kelly, and rounders that infested the
Mint saloon are saying hard things of the
Burns push. The cause of the trouble is
traced to the wild cavorting of Kelly in
the Republican Municipal Convention at
Bnai B'rith Hall Wednesday afternoon.
The. followers of Burns assert that Kelly
had no warrant for intruding his person
ality, as the programme provided. that the
Ruef rollcall should be accepted without
quibbling. It Is contended by the critics
of Kelly that a suiilcient number of votes
had been pledged to Bergerot to secure
the latter's election, hence Martin Kelly's
exhibition of boss effrontery was uncalled
for and disastrous. The decree has gone
forth from the Burns corral that Kelly
must be turned down publicly and severe
ly rebuked lor glaring and pernicious ac
tivity on the floor of the convention.
Kelly Wanted to Impress Herrin.
Another story, and one that seems
plausible, Is to the eifecc that Kelly de
liberately took the wind from the sail?
of Dibble, Lynch and Goldberg so that he
could sail up to Herrln and present Ber
gerot as the prbduct of Mint saloon boss
ism. Kelly has no special love for Burns.
It is quite well known that Burns regards
Kelly as a "lobster" in politics and never
fails to advise Herrln that Kelly is not
tit to be trusted in handling boodle for
Supervisors and legislators. Kelly resents
thu Mexican's assumption of superiority
and virtue. In Kelly's catalogue Bogus
Telegram Lynch is rated as tne slowest
lobster in the bunch. Kelly's motive,
therefore, in displaying his strength on
the floor of the convention was to Impress
Herrin with the notion that he could man
age affairs without the assistance of
Burns, Lynch and Dibble.
Boss Ticket Would Be Repudiated.
It is acknowledged all around that Kelly
has tire convention, but the question is,
What Is he going to do with it? Hun
dreds of well-known Republicans assert
that it is so thoroughly discredited that
a ticket put forth under its auspices
would be instantly repudiated and reject
ed by the masses of the party.
It is reported that orfers of compromise
will be made to the decent elements of the
convention, but the anti-boss forces- of
the County Commiii.ee resolved at the
outset that they would never compromise
I with fraud find crime. Comparison of rec
ords since the adjournment of the conven
tion shows that Bergerot's election was
obtained by false counting. The boss del
egations In voting under the unit rule
voted absentees, out Chairman Bouvier
refused to allow application of this rule
in the voting of anti-boss delegations. In
the Forty-second District Wilson was de
prived ol ten votes by the ruling of Bou
vler:
Anti-Boss Forces to Caucus. ;
A caucus of the â¢ anti-boss forces will
probably be held early next week. The
course to be pursued in the future may be
shaped by the expression of the best Re
publican pentiment. The Call has stead
fastly maintained from the beginning that
the workingmen, merchants, professional
men and taxpayinc citizens of Republican
talth could never be marched to the polls
under the banner of Kelly, Crlmmlns,
Lynch and Dibble.- Clean nominations by
a clean convention are demanded. There is
a widespread and growing sentiment
among Republicans in favor of independ
ent action in the cause of good govern
ment and clean politics.

WALTERS' STORY TOO
THIN FOR THE JURY
Ingenious Tale of the Santa Rosa
Counterfeiter Helped to In-
sure His Conviction.
Walter Walters was convicted yester
day by a jury in the United States Dis
trict Court of having had seventeen coun
terfeit nickels in his possession, together
with a complete counterfeiting apparatus,
In Santa Rosa on June 30 of this year. He
was ordered to appear for sentence next
Saturday.
Walters swore on the stand that the
antimony, tin, lead and tools found in his
room by United States Secret Service
Agent liazen were used by him In mend
ing mllkcans while he was working as a
cook and barkeeper. He explained the
possession of a bucket of fine dentist's
plaster of parts by saying that he used it
to cover flowers with that he was send
ing to friends in the East. The plaster,
he alleged, kept the flowers fresh and
unfaded. The seventeen bad nickels
found in his possession, he said, had been
given him in change by a friend whose
name he could not remember
the announcement that R. Porter Ashe,
candidate for Congress, would speak.
Mr. Ashe was received with great en
thusiasm, but excused himself from mak
ing an extended address on the Issues of
the day, as he had promised to reserve his
'first regular campaign speech for his own
Assembly district. He thanked the dele
gates from the Twenty-ninth District for
standing by him in the convention and
assured his auditors that In him they did
not have a dude candidate." as he was born
and reared south of Market street.
Assemblyman Warden also made a short
address. Before Ashe's arrival J. E.
Murphy, one of the candidates for the
Democratic nomination for Justice of the
Peace, made a stirring speech.
Determined efforts were made to defeat
Hon. C. M. Belshaw for the .Republican
nomination for the Senate in the district
comprised by the .counties of Martn and
Contra Costa. The opposition to Mr. Bel
shaw came chleily from the Southern Pa
cific Company. In the Legislature he
was Independent and outspoken. When
orders were given by the railroad for Re
publican Assemblymen to fall into lino
and support Burns for the United States
Senate, Mr. Belshaw firmly refused to
obey. In the campaign preceding the re
cent primary election for delegates to the
nominating convention Mr. Belshaw sub
mitted a plain statement of facts to the
people of his Senatorial district, and they
sustained his course in the Assembly by
electing delegations favorable to his nom
ination for the Senate. In a fair contest
he won and received the nomination.
The political agents of- the Southern Pa
cific are now casting about for a Demo
cratic nominee to oppose Mr. â¢ Belshaw.
Jere Burke, speaking for the railroad, is
making overtures to J. M. Mekins of Ma
rin County. In order to persuaxle Mr.
Mekins to enter the race against Belshaw,
the promise of Southern Pacific support is
tendered. JCo doubt the bosses and po
litical agents of the railroad will nut up a
strong Democratic tight against Mr. Bel
shaw. It has been demonstrated that he
will not take programme orders." and Is
therefore not the kind of a man that the
railroad wants in the Legislature. v

The Entire Mexican Colony Deter
mines to Make the Present Oc
casion One cf the Most Elab
orate They Have Held.
The stockholders of the Pacific 'Coast
Jockey Club have taken one of the most [
significant steps in the history of
their corporation, and one which
seems deeply significant to the Interests
of horse racing in this State. At a stormy
meeting, in which every measure was bit
terly fought by an aggressive minority,
the stockholders voted conditionally to
lease the Ingleside track to the San Fran
cisco Jockey Club, the new association or
ganized under the direction and presi
dency of Prince Ponlatowskl and now
controlling Tanforan Park.
In voting to give this lease the stock
holders appointed a committee of three
to pass upon terms and conditions and re
port its recommendations yesterday to
the main body. A meeting was held, but
nothing was done, and now the minority
claims that no lease has been determined
upon and that the whole proceeding is ;
irregular and illegal. The majority in
sists that the committee has unquestion
ed power to act, present its suggestions
and leave them to the ratification of the
stockholders.
Incidental to the main business of the
first meeting was another of importanceâ
the summary removal of Henry J.
Crocker as a director of the Pacific Coast
Jockey Club by the directors and the elec
tion of Hall McAllister in his stead. ( The
remarkable fact was discovered that the
books of the association showed that
Henry J. Crocker does not possess a single
share of stock and is In consequence with
out right to act as a director.
The first and stormy meeting of the
stockholders was held on Wednesday
with M. P. Tarpey in the chair and the
following present: F. H. Green, Charles
A. Gardner, Wellington Gregg Jr., Wil
liam Angus, Hall McAllister, Henry Ach.
F. Misner and Ixmls Ivissak. Henry Ach
acted for himself, A. F. Ullman and Pat
rick Dunne. William Argus represented
M. A. Gunst as well as himself, and Louis
Lissak represented Thomas H. Williams
Jr. Upon roll call it was shown that 41u3
shares out of a total of 4962 were repre
sented by the owners or by proxies. Of
the 859 shares which were not represent
ed at the meeting, 700 were in the name
of the notorious Edward Corrlgan.
As soon as the meeting opened it was
seen that a stubborn minority, represent
ed persistently by Henry Ach and occa
sionally by Louis Lissak, was present.
This minority held 1159 Bhares of stock
and necessarily was defeated upon every
point. But Ach was persistent to the end,
fighting every measure, even that which
called the meeting to order. He objected
to the meeting on the ground that no
legal notice had been given. He was over
! ruled. He objected to the reception of
1 Gunst's proxy and again â¢was outvoted.
Hall McAllister asked if it were not
true that Director Henry J. Crocker did
not own a share of stock in the corpora
tion. He was told that Crocker owned no
stock according to the books. McAllister
moved therefore that Crocker's seat as a
director be declared vacant and that his
successor be elected to the vacancy. Lis
8ak seconded the motion, and Ach ob
jected to the entire proceeding, claiming
that the stockholders had no right to cre
ate a vacancy or fill one In the directory.
McAllister's motion prevailed and Henry
J. Crocker ceased to be a director. Upon
motion of Angus and the second of Mis
ner, McAllister was elected to fill the va
cancy.
Then came the struggle over the main
business of the session â the lease of In
gleside track to the San Francisco Jockey
Club. Angus declared that he had re
ceived a paper, which he proceeded to
read. It was a proposed agreement be
tween the Pacific Coast Jockey Club and
the San Francisco Jockey Club in which
the former leased to the latter the prop
erty known as the Ingleside track. It was
explained that the lease would be for ten
years and that the San Francisco Jockey
Club would guarantee to the Pacific Coast
Jockey Club a 4 per cent annual Interest
upon Its Investment and an adequate In
surance upon its property. Ach moved
that the document be laid upon the table.
His motion was lost, and trie lease was
before the stockholders for their consid
eration.
Ach objected to the lease on the ground
that no stated sum of money was as
sured; that the San Francisco Jockey
Club was not sufficiently Identified, and
that the Pacific Coast Jockey Club had no
right to lease Its property. These and a
score of other objections in like vein he
made, and then McAllister moved that the
Pacific Coast Jockey Club lease its prop
| erty to the San Francisco Jockey Club
and that the terms and conditions of the
lease be submitted to a committee of three
to pass upon the lease and make recom
mendations at an adjourned meeting of
the stockholders. This motion was sec
onded by Misner and Gregg and was car
ried, Ach, Dunne. Ullman and Williams
voting in the negative.
The president being authorized to ap
point the committee of three, he chose
McAllister, Angus and Ach. Ach declined
I to serve and Lissak was selected. He
| also refused, and there being no one else
In the minority Wellington Gregg Jr. was
chosen. He resigned in favor or Charles
A. Gardner, who accepted.
After a series of questions propounded
by Ach It was, then txplained that no final
action whatever had been taken in refer
ence to a lease. A committee of three had
simply been appointed to suggest terms
1 and conditions and a report must be made
to the stockholders for their considera
tion. Ach asked the committee if every
. one of them had not already fully deter
mined to lease the property of the Pacific
Coast Jockey Club to the San Francisco
Jockey Club by virtue of directions ob
tained from Prince Poniatowskl. Angus
replied that he would answer fully when
he made his report to the adjourned meet-
Ttiat adjourned meeting was held yester
day, but it also adjourned without accom
plishing anything, ' and there the affair
rests for the present. The Pacific Coast
. Jockey Club has voted to lease its Ingle
side property conditional upon the renort
of a committee In reference to terms. That
committee Is not yet ready to suggest
terms.
The reason for the sudden anÂ«l unexpect-
I ed adjournment of the meeting yesterday
was that one of the prominent members
i of the association who favors the leasing
I of Ingleslde received a telegram from
I Prince Poniatowski to do nothlnjr until
further notice from him. The Prince is
not sure of his ground and it may be that
the deal he was engineering will never be
I consummated. At the meeting on Wednes
| day Henry Ach wanted to know partic
u*.nrly what the San Francisco Jockey
I Club Intended to pay for the lease, if" the
club Intended to pay 4 per cent net upon
the actual cost and amount of monev In
vested in the property of the Pacific Coast
Jockey Club. Until that question is an
swered there will be no further negotia
tions.

Webster Preparing to Force by Law
Acceptance of His Classification.
The bombshell which Superintendent of
Schools Webster threw into the camp of
the Board of Education Wednesday re
garding the overcrowded condition of the
city's schools has borne fruit and has
oai:s'Â»d that body to take Immediate
action in order to relieve the congestion.
Chairman Mark announced yesterday
that the boarJ had decided to begin re
lieving' the rttuntion by immediately as
signing a teaorer to the Beroal Heights
School. The two vacant class rooms in
the IlrJght Primary will also be utilized.
and this frill n*vÂ«"sita.te the appointment
of two rear* teachers. The South Knd
Primary and Buena Vista schools may
also get additional teachers. The beard
Â¦vrill to-day vieit the Columbia. South
End. Horace Mann. Falnnount. Haw
thorne, llaight. Marshall and Agasslz
schools, and if it rinds the existing con
ditions as represented by Superintendent
Webster more teachers will be assigned
where they are necessary. The surplus
pupils of the Apassiz will be sent to the
Ed:-=on School, and It is thought by the
board that another teacher will not be
r.oo-iicd there.
Superintendent Webster is delighted
tliat his report will result In the giving
of proper accommodations to all pupils.
He has received an intimation that the
board will proceed of its own motion to
carry out some of his recommendations,
though professing to make the needed
Improvements on its own account. He
sa>s that he simply did his duty in noti
fying the board of the lamentable condi
tion which its high classification had
brought about. The report is based on
the statement of principals, he says, and
it Is for the board to take, action to re
lieve the crowded condition of some
classes.
"I PhaM Insist."? said Mr. "Webster, "on
the appointment of twenty-eight teach
ers. I understand that the board Intends
to assign a few pedagogues, but I will
not recede from my stand that twenty
eight additional teachers are absolutely
neevssary. I have received competent le
iral advice that the board is usurping my
prerogative regarding classification, and
should it refuse to comply with my rec
ommendations regarding the same I shall
carry out certain plans now being formu
lated by my attorney to compel it to do
so. I do rot desire to involve any teach
ers ar.d that contingency will be avoided
In the method to be followed, which I do
not care to make public.
"The employment of twenty-e'ght teach
ers will about take care of those who
were consolidated out. and at the sam?
time right a grave injustice that was done

"The proser.t b^ard seems to forget that
its prefleceatm in office did about all the
consolidation wcrk that could be done.
By legislation of 1SJÂ»3 the board made it
tscotabeat upon me to proceed with the
desiccation, and as a result 114 teach
er* were taken off the pay roll, which was
about r.s mu< h as the efficiency of the
department could stand. This action was
necessary because ihÂ« previous board had
put 2St> :*-achers in the department, which
number was far in excess of the legal de
mands.
"The hoard backs up its classification
by stating that there will be a decrease
in attendance during the winter and
spring months. Also that a number of
tju; Ha w ( .l! be promoted from the ad
varced eighth grades to the high school.
While this may be true, it does not dissi
vaif the fact that there is a large num
lirr of <hildr*-n who are at present with
out accommodations which the law says
Ehoulr] be guaranteed them."
iiari: oxr.^ets that at least 500 pupils
â¢will po from the advanced eighth grades
of ihe Colombia. Denman, Crocker and
Horifie Mann schools to the high school
efur Christmas, and it is the intention of
the board to allow the grammar classes
to remain as ihey are after the promo
tions until the end of the term. Mark
says that the board will relieve the con-
CestM condition wherever it is justified
in doing so. H^ states that it is certain
that many of the substitute teachers â¢will
be regularly assigned in the chronological
order of thflr appointment.
Superintendent Webster called upon
Auditor Veils yesterday morning and
asked him if he would sign the salary de
mands of teachers which he proposes to
eppoint if the board refuses to do so. He
stated that his attorneys had advised him
that if there wits need of more teachers
the State law made it mandatory on him
to make the appointments.
"In that case." said the Auditor. "I will
request my attorneys to meet your legal
advisf rs. and whatever the Joint decision
may be I shall abide by it."
HOLMES' REACH
FOR ROYALTIES
WAS FRUITLESS
He Was Paid.
Is Net Entitled to a Patent
on Piers for Which
Attorney General Tlrey LÂ». Ford and
E>eputy AV. M. Abl>ott have put a stop to
the attempt of : Chief Engineer H. C.
Holmes of the Harbor Commission to se
cure from the State thousands of dollars
in royalties on patent piling.
Holmes has been the engineer of the
board for many years? and was paid $250
per month by the State. In 1SS5 he was
directed to prepare plans and specifica
tions for the construction of a new pier
at Pacifio street.
The plan he proposed included steel cyl
inder i;iers, filled with concrete, with pile
cores in three piles each and a wooden
superstructure, etc., and the pier was
constructed In accordance with Holmes'
plans.
In November, 1S33. Holmes, unknown to
the board, made application for a patent
covering the method of construction as
described la his olflcial report, and on
Aprii 3. 1000, a patent was issued. Pier 7
was completed before Holmes applied for
his patent. The entire work was paid for
by the State. All c-y.per.ses. including the
office and office supply of Holmes, mate
rial for plar-s, specitic.itions and draw
ings, were paid for by the State.
In July, 1SS9, Holmes recommended the
reconstruction of Howard-street wharf.
In place of the steel cylinders, as used in
pier 7, he recommended wooden casings
with wroughtiron hoops. His plan was
adopted ar.d later plans and specifications
were completed and adopted by the board
and contracts let for the construction of
Howard-street wharf.
On May 2. 1900. the chief engineer In
formed the Commissioners that he was
about to submit plans and sptjeifieations
for piers 19, 21, 23 and 25. Before doinp so
he informed the board that he had been
allowed a patent for the construction of
the piers, as contained in his specifica-'
tions, and expected to be allowed a roy
alty for the use of the patent. This was
the hrst intimation that the board re
ceived of the existence of the patent
This opened the eyes of the board, and
the Attorney General was asked to ascer
tain Holmes' lepal rights if he had any.
1 he State's attorneys, in an opinion ren
dered yesterday, show that a person Is
not entitled to a patent for an invention if
ihe same has bÂ«ren In public use or on
sale for two years prior to his application
therefor, unless the use has been experi
mental.
Referring to the use of the wooden cvl
:nders Instead of the steel cylinders the
opinion cites a large number of authori
ties which show that a person is not en
titled to a patent where there has been
merely a substitution of material for an
other without involving a new mode of
construction or developing anything sub
stantially new in the resulting structure
and that in the case in Question the
change from steel to wood Is not patent
