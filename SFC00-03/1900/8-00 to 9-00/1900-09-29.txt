Official Declares Germany Aims to
Restore Harmony.
. BERLIN. Sept. 2S.â An official of tha
Foreign Office to-day called attention to
a statement of a London paper that "tho
view prevails In the United States that
Germany, in issuing her recent note, wai
trying to take the diplomatic lead In the
Chinese question." This assertion he em
phatically denied, declaring that, on the
contrary. Germany was merely endeavor-
Ing by means of her proposal to restore
harmony among the powers.
"Conditions are not yet ripe." he said,
"for beginning negotiations, although the
only obstacle is China herself. The recent
acts of the Chinese Government shows
that It is still far from respecting the
will of the powers. If it should show a
change of spirit by delivering some of tho
guilty mandarins for punishment that
would be the time to talk of making
peace."
When the attention of the Foreign Office
official In question was called to the ex
treme difficulty of capturing the guilty
persons In such a vast country, even sup
posing that an agreement had been
reached as to who they are, he replied:
"It would not be necessary to catch
them all. It would be quite sufficient to
punish those who are the easiest to
catch."

HOW FILIPINOS FIT BULLETS
Considerable Ingenuity Is Displayed
by the Insurgents.
WASHINGTON', Sept. 2S.â Colonel Clar
ence R. Edwards, chief of the insular di
vision in the War Department, has re
ceived a letter from an officer in the Phil
:ppineF which shows the ingeniouÂ«nrs:<
of the Filipinos and the manner in which
they take advantage of everything in the
way of materials for carrying on the war.
Tho writer says:
"I have sent you a couple of rounds of
ammunition that I captured in a trench
the other day. At first glance it looks
;ikÂ«Â» Mauser ammunition, but If you will
notice the marking? on the base you will
see that one Is K. C. and the other W. S.
A. ammunition, both 30 caliber. One is
a cartridge that some Eoldier dropped and
the other Is a reloaded shell. Both are
filed off fo that they will go Into a clip.
I tried them In a captured Mauser rifle
And they worked finely. The ammunition
that Is used In the Remington Is Just as
ingenious. They use anything from an
old 45-pIstol shell, or the shell of a 30-cal-
Iber, to a home-made shell from a tin
ran. Except In the Mausers, of which
:hey have only a few, they use black
r>owder and not very good at that."
The writer also relates some of his ex
periences with the Filipinos; He says
they are jrreat In getting on a hill, firing
n fpw shots and then petting away. The
country about him Is full of decayed
hrmp. making It very difficult for him to
ret through Â¦with his men. Pursuit of the
Filipinos in small bands Is thus very un
satisfactory."

many days and nights of anxious thought
much ,troubled by the perplexing alternative
before ua In the Impending election The
more- I think of it. the more does every droD
pf my blood revolt i at the monstrous wrone
we have done and continue to do; and the more
clearly does my reason tell me that the doI-
Icy of Imperialism has brought upon our re
public the greatest peril to the Integrity of
its free institutions, its peace. Its honor and
its true greatness that has ever befallen it
that conscientiously I can never, never con
sent to uphold that policy by helping to keen
In Dower those who wantonly originated Â»n.i
are now carrying it on: and that. as. an honest
man and an Americnn patriot. I am In dutv
bound to contribute my humble aid to what
ever gives us an assurance, or â¢ even only a
reasonable hope, of Its overthrow. That dutv
calls on us all aloud. Let us then, come what
may. stand together with a good conscience
and unflinching courage for Truth, Justice and

What is there to be said against this? Tho
administration" party pretend that they sub
stantially, propose the same thine that Is Dro
poeed by their opponentsâ to give the islanders
a . stable government. But cannot every child
nee the vital difference between securing to
them a staple government under forlgn rule
which they are fighting against, and a stable
government under their own sovereignty, which
they are fighting for?
Â¦ A grievous wrong has been done to the Porto
Illoans by denying them their Just rights, and
to the'PhiHpplne Islanders by basely betraying
them and subjugating them with a bloody
hand. A wrong has been done to our own
people by violating the vital and conservative
principles of our republic, besmirching our
national honor. A wrong has been done to all
mankind by setting a bad example which dis
courages tho belief In the salutary efficacy of
democratic Institutions. We are bound to
repair that wrong even If It costs us some
thing. The first thing necessary . is that the
American people should not by their votes ap
prov# the wrongful acts by keeping those who
liave done them in the name of the republic
In places of power, thus encouraging them to
go on.' but should stamp the wrong done and
tho wrons-doers with the most emphatic vote
of condemnation. We should put In their
Places others that recognize the wrong: done
and are willing to repair It. The American
people should then. Insist that the Government
of this republic should do all In its power. In
stead of slaughtering those who fight for their
freedom and Independence to assist them In
formlnc an Independent government of their
own and take such measures to protect them
aralnst foreign Interference as may be re
culred. In one word, we ; should simply do
for them what we have promised to do for
the Deoi>le of Cuba. This is- what tho plain
duty of the American people demandsâ a duty
of honor and' patriotism. â¢ Â¦ â¢ â¢ â¢ '
I have again and again challenged the Im
perialists to show me- In the whole history of
the. world a. slriKle act of perfidy committed by
any republic more infamous than that commit
ted by Mr. McKlnley's administration against
our Filipino allies, and I have received a*
answer but a sickly sneer.
President McKlnley's "benevolent assimila
tion" order of December 21, 1R38. was an open
and rude declaration of war against the Fili
pinos standing up for their freedom and Inde
pendence. â¢ '
Mr. Schurz gave fan exhaustive review
of the incidents leading up to the war
with the Filipinos. He discussed Presi
dent McKlnley's letter of acceptance and
accused the President of evasion and con
cealment of the facts. He resumed:
Ihe truth Is that until two years asro this
republic did Indeed add to Its territory, but
never without the Intention and well-founded
expectation that the acquired soil would be
occupied by a population of our own, or at
least homogeneous with our own. and that It
would In course of time be formed Into regular
States of this union under our constitution. It
was, â¢ therefore, not mere expansion of our ter
ritorial domain to be perpetually ruled by our
arbitrary will, but It was essentially an In
tended and in the course of time practical ex
tension of our constitutional system In entire
accord with the fundamental principles of our
democracy. - .-â¢Â«',:â¢â¢
Let me say,, at. the start that I consider the
manner In which the imperialistic policy is
reins commended by some persons to popular
approval the hugest confidence same ever prac
ticed upon a free people. In my whole long
life I have nwer known of such systematic
use of distortion of history, hypocritical cant
garnling of documents and false pretense. I
am here to speak a word for truth and justice,
and in doing- so I shall call t nines by- their
right names. You will pardon me If
those names are not always of the
mildest, for I must confess when I wit
nessed some tit the means employed to lure
this great republic from the path of rlBhteous
ntss, high principle and glorious destiny, my
old blooi bollevl with indignation.
Carl Schurz was introduced and was
given another round of applause. He said

NEW YORK, Sept. 2S.-Cooper Union
was not large enough to hold the crowd
which came to-night to its doors to attend
the meeting of the Anti-Imperialist
League of New York. \
The crowd was a noisy one.* and before
the meeting was called to order cheered
for McKinley, Bryan, 'for the "full dinner
pal!" and for Debs. Carl Schurz was re
ceived with a tumult of cheers. Ernest
H. Crosby introduced the first speaker of
the evening. Anson P. Stokes, who said
in part \
The committee in charge have arranged
for eighteen speeches in this State to
morrow. At Phllippsburg a very large
crowd assembled, to which Governor
Roosevelt spoke briefly. Ills hearers
cheered roundly. At Smith Center there
we're many men and women on the plat
form and around the- station.
Apparently the entire population of
Mankato and surrounding districts had
assembled at the little station to see and
hear the candidate for Vice President.
At Bellville the Governor was taken
from the train and placed on a platform
near by. He spoke for ten minutes to a
very large number of listeners. Six or
seven hundred people had assembled at
Clyde. When the special train pulled In
there was a shout and a rush for the rear
platform. where Governor Roosevelt
stood. A short speech was made, and
when the train was moving off a rush
was made to shake hands, and several
womon and children were trampled and
injured In the rush.
LEBANON. Kans.. Sept. 2S.â Governor
Roosevelt's campaigning began here early
this morning. The first stop made by the
special train on its way to Kansas City
was at Jennings at 7 o'clock. Early as
was the hour, the New York executive
went out and spoke a few words to the
small crowd on the platform from the
rear end of the car. Norton was reached
at 8 o'clock, and there the Governor left
the train and was escorted to the plat
form in the open air, where he made his
second speech In Kansas. The stop there
was brief. Governor Roosevelt reminded
his hParers that in. 1860 Kansas had stood
for liberty in deed and not in name only
for that liberty that knows how to gov
ern Itself and. therefore, how to govern
others. He said they would be unworthy
sons if they did not try to maintain tho
heritage for which their fathers had shed
their blood.
At Prairie View the Governor was in
troduced from the rear end platform to
the crowd on the ground. He said:
"I am told that there is here a settle
ment from the land from which my an
cestors came. Is that true? (cries of 'Yes')
If you will let a Dutchman give a word
of advice I will give it. Out In the land
from which royancestor8Â»came they keep
the flood out by dykes. As you know,
Holland has been won from the sea. They
put the dykes up to keep the waters out.
Putting the dykes up does not make the
land prosperous unless the land Is culti
vated. The only way it can be cultivated
is to keep the water out. During the last
four yearn in this country we have been
putting up a big dyke to keep Bryanism
out. I hope no one is going to be foolish
enough to break down the dykes."
When the. train drew Into Junction City
a great surprise awaited the Governor
Drawn up in line on their horses were
Buffalo Bill s soldiers and Indians in cos
tume and a largo crowd of people. A
dozen or more of the soldiers were found
to have been members of Governor
Roosevelt's own regiment, who were with
him In Cuba. Cody's cannon and Gat
llng guns belched forth a salute to the
incoming train. When tho train stopped
Cody, in the picturesque dress of a pio
neer frontiersman, appeared at the rear
of the coach and. was warmly greeted bv
the Governor. After Governor Roosevelt
had concluded his remarks of a few min
utes' duration, he Introduced Cody to the
crowd. Colonel Cody said:
"Ladles and Â¦< gentlemen, Governor
Roosevelt is the American cyclone, and- 1
don't wonder that some have taken to
their cellars. The Wild West Is here not
to .make political speeches. The' ticket
Governor Roosevelt represents is already
elected and all they have got to do is to
show down and take the pot. I have
with me members of Colonel Hunt's regi
ment. T have others who have belonged
to the Sixth and. Tenth Cavalry. I also
have with me some of the men who aro
the best soldiers from Great Britain and
the Continent. I came to Kansas as a
boy In 1853. I doubt If there is a man
within the hearing of ray voice who has
been here so long. My father gave his
blood and his life for the freedom of
Kansas. He stood between civilization
and savagery. Every mile of Kansas haa
been covered and won with blood. We
had to expand. Kansas Is -still -expand
ing. The State was then known as
'bleeding Kansas,' It Is no longer
â¢bleeding Kansas'; it is one of the great
States of the Union,"
HUTCHINSON. Kans.. Sept. 2S.-The
first day ir Kansas of the Roosevelt cam
paign was successful so far as audiences
and Interest were concerned. The meet
ings were larger and the interest greater
than at any time during the trip west of
the Mississippi River. The Kansas towns
appear to be turning out en masse, and
the country people are joining their forces
to the numbers and interest of those In
the towns. Bis meetings -were held at
Abilene. Sal'na and Londsborg. The last
meeting of the day was at this place,
and as it was a night meeting and had
been well prepared for and advertised It
was by far the greatest demonstration of
the day.
National Republican Committeeman
Mulvane and the State Committee of
Kansas Â¦ arranged to-day seventeen
speeches for Governor Roosevelt, includ
ing a night speech and a day journey of
290 miles. The result has been that the
special Roosevelt train did not reach
Hutchinson until 10 o'clock, two and a
half hours late. The train failed to run
on schedule time, and thousands of-peo
ple were kept in the open air at different
places along the road for hours awaiting
the arrival of the train.

Recent Assault on

Topic for
Bryan.
ABERDEEN. S. D., Sept. 28.-W. J.
Bryan completed his tour of South Da
kota at this place to-night. He arrived
here at 8:30 o'clock and immediately re
paired to the speaking place, near the
Corn Palace, where he was met by one of
the largest crowds that have greeted him
during the-campaign. The day had been
a very busy one, but the Democratic can
didate had seldom appeared to better ad
vantage. He was In excellent voice and
spoke with distinctness and grace. Dur
ing the day Mr. Bryan traveled 260 miles
and made almost a dozen speeches. - He
began the day with a three-minute speech
at -Elk Point, and his first speech ot
length was made at Yankton. After this
speech he made long addresses In. the
towns of Scotland, Mitchell. Woonsocket,
Huron, Redficld and Aberdeen. The
crowds were largo at all the places at
which the party stopped, and especially
so at this point and at Mitchell.
Mr. Bryan's remarks upon the starch
combination, as it affects the Argo works
at Nebraska City, made at Yankton, were
In part as follows: '.
The Republican party to-day stands for the
trust, ami If any Republican In this commu
nity tolls you that the party is going to de
stroy the trusts I wish you would just cut out
nn editorial which appears In tlii* morning's
Sioux City Journal and read the editorial to
your Kppublican friend and Bhow him that the
Republican )>:t;*;rs to-day instead of trying to
find a way to destroy the trusts ai*e defending
'.he trusts. Vou will fln<l In the paper an edi
torial In regard to the Nebraska City meeting
which we had there last Wednesday. I will
tell yo'i About the meeting In order that you
may understand the editorial. We have a starch
factory In Nebraska City and it went into the
Btrach trust, and the Attorney General of
Nabraska, a Democrat, elected by the fusion
forces, has commenced suit to dissolve the
trust and restore the management of thn Arso
Starch Company to the local people there. The
republicans of Nebraska City made a protest
against the enforcement of the law. I want
you to understand that when a man steals JoO
you Republicans are In favor of prosecuting
him. but when a trust conspires against seventy
fhilHon of people you protest against the law
toeluz enforced. . â¢
At Nebraska City a Republican Judise was
chairman of the committee on resolutions at
the meetlnu and "presented resolutions asking
the Attorney General not to enforce the law
against the trust. Now, this paper says that
Â»he people there were opposed to trusts until
that trust was located in their midst, and then
they saw what a Rood thing the trust was
and they did not want it disturbed, and that
as soon as the people throughout the country
know what Rood things the trusts are they will
be opposed to disturbing them, and that every
man wnrklnp for n trust would be opposed to
interference with that trust. I want you Re
publicans to know that your party never In
tends to destroy the trusts.
At Mitoholl Mr. Bryan made the longest
speech of the day. speaking for more than
nn hm:r. The audience numbered many
thousands. The meeting was held on va
cant Rround near the Corn Palace, an im
mense structure of Indian corn, where
the corn belt exposition was held. Mr.
Bryan mounted a* table and addressed
himself to the people on one side and then
to those on the other, going- around the
circle without partiality. Mr. Bryan be
gan his speech by saying. that he had not
supposed that there were so many people
in the country as there were present. The
first part of the address at Mitchell was
devoted to a presentation of Mr. Bryan's
views upon the attitude of the Republican
party toward tho gold standard and na
tional banks. He discussed also the Phil
ippine question at some length, but for the
most part along old lines.
"I once heard a man talking about a
dog running after a train," he said. "A
man asked: 'What would the dog do If he
got It?* Likewise I ask. What would the
Republicans do if .they got the Filipinos?'-
Mr. Bryan had excellent audiences also
at "Woonsocket and Huron, speaking at
the former place thirty minutes and at the
latter almost an hour. At Woonsocket he
devoted some attention to the railroads
and the interstate commerce law, declar
ing that the Republicans were opposed to
amending it so as to make It effective.
The people at Huron seemed disposed to
ask questions, and Mr. Bryan announced
that he would reply to any. perBon who
would give his name and his politics.
He responded to questions about remedies
for the trusts, and then some. one asked
about the Ice trust. . To this question Mr.
Bryan replied:, - '
"The ice trust is a New York "and not a
national affair, and the New York people
can take care of It. But the Governor of
New York. Instead of correcting the lco
trust, comes out West to make speeches
But I want to go a little farther. Every
director of the ice trust Is a Republican,
and yet you people do not even attempt
to destroy a Republican trust."
Some one also asked: "Why did Teddy
get rotten-egged in Colorado?' 1
Mr. Bryan replied: "Ask those who did
It. I might suggest to you that when
they threw rotten eggs at me In Chicago
not one Republican found fault with ft;
but, my frlerid3. I am going to do better
than the Republicans. I am going to find
fault with any. one who Interferes with
any man who expresses his opinion on any
question in the United States."

tel. WASHINGTON. Sept. 2S.â From the
vmks of oonflic-inp: reports in circulation
relative to Ohh:ii it is apparent that the
administration ha? deduced these facts:
Thit the return of the Imperial Govern
ment to Peking will not lx 1 feasible until
all the interested powers give a guarantee
<f protection to not only the Emperor, but
to the Empress Dowagrr as well.
Th.it the Imp-rial Government, which at
this moment !s the Empress Dowaprer. is
Mill highly favorable to the Boxer move
mrnt, but hope fs expressed that the in
formation published by The Call this
morning from Chinese sources of the
degradation of Tuan is correct, as in such
rvf-nt this Government will be able to act
to preserve the Chinese territorial entity.
The department understands, however,
that Shenp is authority for the news ot
Tuan's appointment as grand secretary.
That all the powers, except the United
Ptatep. propose to retain in Peking a con
f-iriVrahle fore* not so much to preserve
â¢ â¢rdrr as to watch over the interests of
th'ir respective governments and that
none of the powers, notwithstanding the
â¢withdrawal of the American troops from
China, contemplate taking steps in the
fame direction.
It was explainer] lo-day that this Gov
ernment has no disf>os ; .tion to physically
punish the Empress Dowager, and that
wh^n peace negotiations are inaugurated
Minister Conger will be authorized to ex
tend to her the protection of this Govern
ment, as he will do in the case of the
Emperor. Li Hung Chang has not ar
rived in Pekintr. and Pnnce Chine will not
l>e:rin negotiations until he has had an
opportunity to discuss the situation with

It developed to-day that as a result of

granting him and Prince Ching full au

Catarrh Is essentially a disease of tho
mucous membrane, the local symptoms
being a profuse discharge of mucus, stop-
page of the nostrils, irritation In throat,
causing coughlns, sneezing, gagging and
frequent clearings of the throat and head.
The usual treatment by local douctes.
snuffs, salves, etc.. often gives temporary
relief, but anything like a cure can only
be obtained by a treatment which removes
the catarrhai taint from the blood and tha
disappearance cf the inflammation from
the mucous surfaces.
A new remedy* which meets these re-
quirements and which so far has been re-
markably successful in curing catarrh la
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets.
These tablets act upon the blood and
mucous membranes only. They can hard-
ly be called a- secret patent medicine as
they are composed of such valuable reme-
dies as Sanguinaria. Hydrastln, Eucalvp-
tol and similar cleansing antiseptics
which cure by eliminating from the blood
and mucous surfaces tho catarrhai poison
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are larsre'
pleasant tasting lozenges taken internal-
ly, allowing them to dissolve, slowly m
the mouth: In this way they' reach the
throat, fauces and the entire alimentary
canal.
If desired they may also be dissolved In
water and used as a douche In addition to
the internal use. but it is not at all neces-
sary to use a douche; a few of them dH-
golved.in the mouth Aairy will be suffi-
cient. However, when there Is much
stoppage of the- nose, a douche made from,
these tablets will give immediate relief
but the regular daily use internally of
these tablets will cure the whole catarrhai
trouble without resorting to the incon-
venience of a douche.
. Dr. Bement states "that CiÂ» Internal
treatment for catarrh Is rapidly taking
the place of the old plan of douching and
local application, and further says that
probably the best and certainly the safest
remedy at present on the market ia
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, as no secret is
made of their composition and all the
really efficient remedies for catarrh are
contained In this tablet."

PRINCIPALS IN THE NOVEL. ELECTION BET RECENTLY MADE AT
SALINAS AND THE JOYS WHICH WILL ATTEND THE PAYMENT
OF THE SAME AS SEEN THROUGH THE EYES OF A CARTOONIST.
SALINAS, Sept. 28.-One of the
most unique election bets ever
agreed upon in this section, as
well as one that will cause an
unlimited amount of amusement
for the spectators, is between two saloon
keepers of this city. The wager is upon
the Presidential election. The loser must
roll a peanut kernel the entire length of
the bituminized portion of Main street,
a distance of five blocks, with no other
instrument to propel it but a toothpick.
Each man who aspires to be absent in
the peanut-rolling affair has put up a
goodly forfeiture of coin, as well as
made a signed statement with two wit
nesses to hold to the agreement. The
whole affair is the outcome of a heated
argument over the Presidential election
recently had in one of the saloons.
Clarence Tynan, proprietor of the Hoff
man, is a strong admirer of Republi
can principles, while Krnest Watermann
of the Yellowstone Is equally as devout a
sympathizer with Bryan's cause. Politi
cal topics were in vogue during the two
gentlemen's conversation, and finally It
was decided to stop the argument, but
make the result of the election prove
more satisfactory to all concerned. A
large money wager was spoken of and in
addition to this a side bet was agreed
upon by which the loser should be more
humiliated than simply being a dispenser
of lucre. Tynan, or "Uncle Jan." as he
is more familiarly known, agrees that if
McKlnley is not re-elected he will at
high noon on the 15th day of November
start at the corner of Main and Castro
ville streets, and with the aid of a wood
en toothpick roll a small peanut kernel
to the intersection of Main and Alisal
streets, all uphill, and a distance of near
ly 1000 yards. Watermann readily con
sented, but further stipulated that a for
feiture of $100 be put up so that in case
the loser does not wish to undergo the
trying ordeal the winner will thus be
compensated.
Matters were all fixed and papers drawn
up and signed by both men and witnessed
by F. H Lang and Mr. Merrill, both no
tary publics as well as members of the
County Republican and Democratic Cen
tral committees respectively. Tynan is

LOS ANGELES, Sept. 2S.-The recent
decision of Judge Ross in the Kern County
oil cases â that is, the cases of the Cosmos
Exploration Company against the Gray
Eagle Oil Company and the Pacific Land
and Improvement Company against the
Elwood Oil Company â bids fair to furnish
an unlimited amount of litigation and the
expenditure of many thousands of dollars
In attorneys' fees.
United States District Attorney Frank
P. Flint and all the employes of his office
are working hard to prepare the cases for
presentation to the Grand Jury, now in
session, In accordance with the suggestion
of the court that the matter of some of
the affidavits be presented to the Grand
Jury with a view to ascertaining if per
jury Â¦was committed.
The statement of Mr. Flint to the effect
that he Intends to request the Grand Jury
to investigate the entire matter of tho
selection of oil lands by "scrlppers" arttl
mine locators and to have It determined
whether or not certain persons have con
spired to acquire unlawfully large tracts
of public domain Is Interesting.
The interest of the members of the le
gal fraternity in the case is daily In- 1
creasing. From the fact that the attor
neys who fought on boih sides of the case
comprised some of the best known [law
yers In the State, the case at first at
tracts attention. Now that it has added to
It the sensational feature of the court
calling the attention of tho United States
District Attorney to affidavits which
would appear false from the very decided
opposite nature of the affidavits, the cases
are attracting attention outsiae the con
fines of the State .tself.
Some of the affidavits assert that the
land In question Is really good agricultural
land and that at the time it was
"scrlpped" there was nothing in the shape
of improvements thereon. In contradis
tinction to these affidavits others made
sworn statements that it was non-agri
cultural land and one of the attorneys
even stated that a jackrabbit could not
live theron.

tain Affidavits Be Presented to

"More than a dozen presidents, super

millions of dollars' damage In this city.
Because we have used only nard coal and

WHITE COTTOLENE is
purer, more efficacious and
healthful than any other cooking
fat. Mrs. Rorer. the eminent
lecturer and authority on pure
food and household economy,
says :
"It Is without odor or flavor, and I can
recommend It in place of lard, or In cakes
In place of butter."
It is to all other frying and
shortening mediums as the ex-
press train to the stage coach, or
electric light to candle light of
olden times.
The production of WHITE
COTTOLENE is the greatest
step of modern science toward
pure food, better cooking, per-
fect health.
WHITE COTTOLENE con-
tains nothing- but pure vegetable
oil and choice beef suet â posi-
tively not a particle of hog fat.
It is, therefore, appetizing, whole-
some and easily digested.

GOLFERS ARE SCARCE
ON THE LOCAL LINKS
Last Saturday a team match was begun
on the Adams Point links by the mem
bers of the Oakland Golf Club. One of the
two teams consisted' of XV. P. Johnson
(captain), E. K. Folger, H. H. Smith. H.
M. A. Miller and A. Higgiris, and the other
of, F. S. Stratton (captain). T. R. Hutch
lnson, James Ames, George de Golla and
H. C. Morris. The match was over eight
een holes and resulted In a tie, which will
be played off. to-day. The captains of the
two teams were appointed and they se
lected their men alternately. Next Sat
urday, October 6, the qualifying round,
over eighteen holes, medal play, for the
competition for. the Captain's cup, will be
played. The eight members who make the
lowest scores will be entitled to play in
the third contest for the trophy, which
was presented to the club by Captain
Orestes Pierce, and is competed for twice
a year. The contest will be over eighteen
holes, medal play, and the winner will
have his name, score, etc.. Inscribed on
the cup, which remains the property of
the club.
The San Francisco Golf Club has not
yet Issued its programme for the fill and
winter, but will soon do so. The ladies of
the club are preparing for a continuous
tournament- to begin on October 6. The
San Kafael Golf Club is In a quiescent
condition just now, the summer visitors
having left the county seat of Marln, and
the golfers not having settled down yet
to their winter play. It is expected, how
ever, that a programme of events will be
given out soon.
The competition for the open champion

been ill, and has Just left San Francisco
for Paso Robles, where he will undergo
treatment for inflammatory rheumatism
in the left hand. E. G. Slomp- through
out the entire season has worked hard to
keep the team together, but even his ef
forts have proved unavailing. There will
be no match to-morrow on tho Webster
street ground at Alameda. On October /
the Alameda eleven will play against tho
Pacific team and that will be the last
scheduled match of the season.
There will, however, be social games not
on the programme. This afternoon sev
eral lovers of the British game who have
not played for some years will go over to
Alameda to get a little preliminary prac
tice for a match that will take place next
month â Old Timers versus Present Day
players. The Old Timers must either oe
above a certain age or have played their
last game several years ago. They will
receive some handicap from the player*
who are in constant practice, but In "pre
cisely what form has not' been decided
yet.
E. II. Hilton, secretary of the cricket
annex of the Santa Cruz Country Club,
Is in correspondence with the players in
this city and wishes to arrange for two
matches in San Francisco before the close
of the season. The Santa Cruz cricketers
were much disappointed at the failure of
their efforts to arrange matches here dur
ing the Admission day celebration, but
the absence of the strongest city players
In Lake County made it difficult to get to
gether suitable teams in San Francisco
The Santa Cruz men suggested October 20
and 21 as dates convenient to themselves
but the absence of H. C. Casldy. captain
of the Pacific Cricket Club, at that time
makes It unsuitable for the wearers of the
scarlet and black. \ The 27th and 2Sth of
October will probably be selected, the vis
itors to play against the Alameda team
on the '27th and against the Paciflc eleven
on the following day.

marsh preserves in neighboring counties will b< alive
with gunmen, who will be cut in force to open the duck
season the very dry the law permits. Nothing but
duck has been heard among the shooters during the
past week. The rifle has been laid aside and shot has taken
the place of shell.
If the reports which have come to town from the keepers
of preserves are even shadowed with truth the first shoot of the
season should be a pleasant one. The marshes are said to be
well supplied with young birds, although the hot weather of
the laEt week has driven out flock after flock of ducks. The
opening day, which this year falls on Monday, will have a ten
dency to keep many of the shooters in town till the following
Saturday, but enough men will try the first day of it to make
the marshes scenes of cannonading.
The Field and Tule Club at Cordelia will have a large
crowd of shooters on its preserves. F. V. Bell, R. H. Dele

The Canvasback Club on the Suisun marshes will be repre
sented by Joseph Sweeney, Herbert Kuhlmann, J. Kuhlmann,
Jame3 Maynard, Nary A. Wands, William Hynes, N. H. Hick

Several of the members of the San Pablo Shooting Club are
out of town, but a few of them will be present to open the
season in fitting fashion.
M. O. Feudner.of the Pringle Shooting Club will shoot on
the preserves near Suisun.
The Empire Gun Club will celebrate the opening of the sea
son with a. bullshead breakfast on its own preserves. All sorts
of good times are promised thesnembers and their friends. A
bluerock and live-bird shoot are on the programme.
Several of the members of the Point Reyes Club, lately or
ganized, will hold an Initial duck shoot on their new preserves.
Reports show that their grounds are well covered with various
kinds of ducks.
SHOOTERS WILL FLOCK TO

Much depends upon the ultimate conse
quences of the suit instituted by the In
gleside Coursing Association against the
Union Park Association to enjoin the lat
ter from operating during those days
which should belong exclusively to tho
petitioners according to the agreement
repudiated by the Union Park Associa
tion. It may mean the cessation of the
operation of San Mateo Park.
A strong rumor, equivocally denied by
some of the members of the Ingleslde . s-
Eociation, floated over the Ban. Mateo
Coursing Park last Thursday and caused
general comment. It was to the effect
that if the Union Park Association was
victorious In the present litigation Ingle-
Pide would not continue the operation of
San Mateo Coursing Park, but would
withdraw until such time as the old In
glrside Park could be operated. Nothing
definite was admitted by the Ingleslde As
sociation in regard to this matter.
Both parks will present good stakes to
day and to-morrow. San Mateo's card is
particularly good from the betting stand
point on account of the uncertainty of the
matches. The stake comprises a number
of high-class dogs and some of rather In
ferior quality. On the whole the drawing
Fhows many dogs whose perfrrr'inces
should be up to the great expactatlOSS.
At Union Park the stake Is particularly
good, many of the best dogs now in the
running being entered. Eighty hounds are
in the stake. Trains will leave at 10:15
and 11 a. m.. 12 m. and 1 p. m.
San Mateo's 80-dogr stake will be no
small drawing card to the leashmen.
Nominators in the John Grace Challenge
Cup stake, which will be run in Novem
ber, are hard at work training their dogs
As this stake will be for $6000 or more the
care and attention bestowed upon the
dogs is warranted.

For just a fe>w flf-eting hours last Sun
day those aggressive young Germans on
the payroll of Hank Harris enjoyed the
ephemeral de'aght of being in tirst place
in the pennant race. The Sacramento*
had lost the morning game in Oakland
and the victory of the Dudes elevated tho
Friscos. But In the afternoon the cham
pions won a game and the Friscos lost tr>
Stockton, receding once more into second
place. It 13 unfortunate for the local
fans that the great struggle for the lea.t
should begin at Sacramento, for If th>Â»
two teams were to meet here to-day there
would be a 'hot time at Recreation. Park.
The series, however, will be watched with
a srreat d?al of interest.
The Friscos are now leading the leaguo
in team batting, and are also doing thÂ«
most successful bunting. Their fielding iÂ»
also first class, but to the team work at
bat may be attributed the splendid spurt
which -was begun weeks ago. There l-Â»
not a player in the team who is not will
ing to sacrifice himself regardless of hi*
batting record when there is a chance to
advance a base-runner. That la the sort
of work that has won pennants in tho
East, and it may have the same conse
quences in the West.
The annual meeting of the Los Angeles

house on Saturday, October 6. when a new

October 4 and 5 on the links of the Chi
cago Golf Club. It is expected that it will
be the most brilliant golfing contest ever
held In this country or in the whole of
America. J. H. Taylor, the present open
champion of Great Britain, who holds the
record on many of the moat famous Eng
lish and Scotch links, will certainly play,
and Harry Vardon. for several years
British open champion and a keen rival
of Taylor, has expressed his intention of
playing. It is probable that Travis. Har
rlman, Douglas and several other tine
amateurs will enter the contest. The tour
nament will be held under the -rules of
the United States Golf Association. XV.
B. Thomas, president of the association,
says that a cop or medal will be given to
the amateur who makes the best medal
score. As no amateur golfer has ever yet
won.flrst place or seems likely to do so it
has been thought well to offer this induce
ment to amateurs. If an amateur should
win the open championship he would re
ceive two hundred dollars, to be expended
in the purchase of plate. Among the
competitors will be Horace Rawlins, who
has already won the championship; "Wil
lie" Anderson, who lost It by only one
stroke; Alexander Smith, who was sec
ond in 1898, and is a brother of Walter

Cardinal football conditions have taken
on a new life that presages more evenness
In big game meets. While California, re
membering the dreaded staleness which
overcame a number of her players late
last season, has gone at this early season
work cautiously during the past week,
Yost at Stanford being forced to elim'nate
"greenness" among players, has cut out
tho liveliest kind of a clip and in four
weeks has developed an eleven which
should give a good account of itself
ngainst Reliance. In many respects it is
a better schooled team than that which
played under Stanford's colors last
Thanksgiving day. It executes plays with
more speed and precision and it can pain
more ground on ttraight play. Of course,
there are Individual weak spots, which
will show on the defense to-day.
The work of the new men. Slaker and
Seeley, will bo watched with no minor in
terest. The former battered Pennsylva
nia's great line for gain upon gain in
games in 1S28 and 1S9D. He is a quick 1
starting, heady line breaker of 178 pounds
in football armor, of rather short, com
pact physique, not unlike Reynolds, Stan-,
ford's half In "94 and "95. Seeley weighs
nearly Â£00 pounds, Is fast and aggressive
and a splendid man with the ball.
Practice, at Berkeley this week has been
enlivened by two important movesâ the
initial line-up between the first and second
elevens and the reduction of the football
squad by Coach Kelly and Captain Prin
gle.
The Varsity has been made up as fol
lows: Cornish, center; Clay and Luce,
guards; Albertson and Pringle. tackles;
Braley and Womble. ends; More, quarter
back; Sherman and Duden, halfbacks;
Fautz, fullback. This line-up has suf
fered several charges in the short ten-min
ute scrimmages, but is a fair, criterion of
the early strength of the blue and gold
eleven There are at least two or three
first-class substitutes for every place but
guard. This position is causing the most
solicitude. Two big freshmen. Overall and
Ramaur, who prefer to try for fullback
but whose 190 pounds are needed more on
the line, will probably be trained for these
weak places.
For preliminary practice games the
work of the last four days has been re
markably snappy. The keen competition
for the empty places on the team is pro
ductive of very hard playing.
The football squad, for the first time in
the history of the college, has proved too
large and unwieldy to cqach. Nearly a
hundred men have appeared for work, and
now, after trying in vain to manage them
single-handed. Coach Kelly has Instructed
Captain Pringle to drop from his list all
clearly second-rate players. Such a policy
at this stage in the season Is unheard of

It wouldn't bo surprising if Flush of
Gold proved as good a breadwinner as her
daddy. Royal Flush. Eight to live was
laid about her In the betting on the mile
run, with a raft of coin going In on Kl
Mirio and Merry Boy. Mounce, on Flush,
parjy assumed the lead and the fllly won
from the jump in l'Al 1^. Grand Sachem
in a drive downed Merry Boy for the
place.
Even money was laid against the St.
Andrew <;olt Articulate to win the two
year-old number, when 1 to 2 looked very
rosy, lie came home on the bit. with Phil
Archibald taking the place from Picklow,
a 5 to 1 shot, in a drive. J. "Woods, on Â«he
heavily played Parsifal, lost his bearings
rounding the horn.
Biily Randall's bay horse, Panamint.
went to the post equal choice with Bam
bouiia for the second live-furlone run.
The former acted badly, being finally left.
For Freedom led to the paddock, where,
under the hard riding of "Chub" Russell,
Mike Kice got up, getting the verdict by
over two lengths. Bamboulla ran third.
For the first running event, a five-fur
long dash. "Bill" Mu try's Kickumbob
closed a receding favorite, and ran a dis
graceful race. Gusto, the heavily played
second choice, collared Billy Moore below
the paddock, winning all out by over a
length. Show honors went to Little Sister.
The sport began with a gentlemen's
roadster race, four scoring down for the
word. Tom Thumb was the chosen one
in the betting and made it in three
straight heats. Localeer, driven by Mr.
Schwartz, suffered from intermittent
bursts of speed, finishing second in two
heats, and if better balanced might have
had a chance to win. Charles Parks, the
insurance man, handling Imp, lost third
money to Lady G.
After throe days of calm, uneventful
sailing the layers of odds at the Golden
Gate Fair Association's meet over at Em
eryville track ran into some squally
weather. About all the talent did yes
terday was to.cash'tlckets, and the prices
laid were not close. Although Kickumbob
ran ounces below his number, and Pana
mirit was left at the post owinc to his un
ruly antics, both ruling: favorites in the
ring, speculators got even by backing
Articulate, Flush of Gold and Briar Hill.

THE election in Cuba for members of a constitu
tional convention passed off quietly and re
sulted in a decided victory for the nationalist
or anti-annexation party. This fulfills the hope of
the well-wishers of Cuba everywhere. There is no
doubt but a system of government can be easily
framed for the island which will preserve the inde
pendence and pronjote the welfare of its people.
- That an island people can remain independent and
maintain a government, even when not perfected
along the lines suggested by the experience of conti
nental countries, is shown by Hayti. While but little
can be said that would flatter the Haytian system, it
has at least maintained the island free from foreign
aggression and has discharged its international obli
gations. Doing this the outside world is but little
concerned with its domestic- administration, which
1 must be assumed to be- such as the. people require and
Â¦ indorse.
Cuba can be certainly no leSs capable of decorous
conduct ! in its international relation, while the su
pciior character of its people is a guarantee of a far
higher class of domestic government. The United
States, in its declaration of war against Spain, as
sumed the responsibility of advising the Cuban gov
ernment, and therefore the constitution must con
form to the enlightened principles of our own. As
sured of the realization of their hope of independence,
the best minds of Cuba are occupied with the problem
of making that independence perpetual and separate
and guarding it by well founded popular institutions.

HOW STOCKTON GIRLS
NAMED THEJR WHEELS
(Stockton Record.)
Three Stcckton girls were taking a spin
on their wheels the other evening and
after riding several miles, stopped by tTu'
roadside to get a drink and take n few
moments* rest. They were quite merry
and vivacious, and the subject happening
to turn on politics, one of the girls, in 3
jjpirlt of fun, took a cup of water, and
sprinkling some on her wheel, remarked:
â¢'I baptize thee in the name of McKinley.
because you made a good run." Another
of the girls took up the cup, and sprink
ling her saddle, said: "I baptize thee in
the name of Roosevelt, because you are a
rough rider." Not to be outdone, the
thirn girl took up the cup and poured
quite a quantity of water over her th>\
with the remark: "I baptize thee in th*
name of Bryan, because you are full of
â¢wijid."

FUTURE OF SOUTH. AFRIC0.
PRESIDENT KRUGER has abandoned the
Transvaal to its fate, and dispatches from
Lourenzo Marquez announce the arrival there
of about 500 Boer refugees who have followed him,
but still some of the sturdy patriots continue the' fight
and are giving Lord Roberts about as much as he can
do to keep his communications safe and the raijroads
in working order. The prolonged resistance of these
men complicates the situation in South Africa and
forebodes trouble to the British in their efforts to
pacify the country and re-establish business. At the
same time the call for the election of a new Parlia
ment in Grea't Britain renders it necessary for Salis
bury to declare what he purposes to do in the direc
tion of pacification. The temper of the British pub
lic during the elections will of course be affected by
the reports received from Africa, and consequently
the guerrilla warfare there may determine the result
in a good many closely contested constituencies
British officers, civilian officials and newspaper
correspondents have begun to study the prospects for
a speedy resumption of business in the Transvaal, but
none of them has found anything to justify a sanguine
expectation in that regard. Discussing the attitude
of the people, one of the closest observers says:
"Along political lines it may be predicted with safety
that the majority will submit to and acknowledge the
new order of things. Yet, in many casesâ one might
almost say in most cases â it will be submission and
not a ready and contented acquiescence. All degrees
of acceptance will be manifested. A few will welcome
the new government, believing that its results will in
clude a hitherto unknown stability. Some will be in
different so long as they are not disturbed in the little
round of a narrow life. Some, probably many, will
cherish an enduring hatred of England and her Gov
ernment, will instill that hatred into the minds of their
children, and, though seeming to "obey their new
rulers, will be ever on the alert for opportunities,
great or small, for manifesting their hostility."
As to the attitude the British authorities ought to
take toward the conquered people there is a wide dif
ference of opinion. Some of the correspondents who
have fojlowed Lord Roberts in his march assert that
the leniency of Roberts has encouraged the Boers to
resist and to continue their guerrilla raids, while
others maintain that the harshness displayed by Brit
ish troopers in raiding farmhouses and villages has
aroused a personal desire for vengeance and provoked
the wrath of the Boers. One set demands that stern
measures be taken to crush the guerrillas, and the
other asks that a more humane treatment be shown
to all classes of Boers in order that they may the more
readily be reconciled to the new government which ii
to be imposed upon them.
Concerning the business conditions of the country
all seem agreed that for many years," at any rate, the
main sources of wealth will be mining and cattle
raising. It will require extensive irrigation to fit the
land for profitable farming. In the end, however,
that will be achieved, and one student of the region
feels sufficiently* sanguine on the subject to say:
"South Africa is 3 great country-, and undoubtedly has
a great future before it, but that future, is not to-mor
row nor the next day. Some day, decades further on.
the world will need it, and will turn it into a garden
that will pay better than air its. gold mines. But it
will be a long way off yet, and probably few of us will
live to see it. South Africa is a sturdy infant, and will
some day, by and by, grow to strong and sturdy man
hood. I also incline to a belief that, when that day
comes, it will have a Hag of its own, and thatAfrica,
'from the Zambesi to. Cape Town,' will belong to. the
Afrikanders.'' . ,
THE CflSE OF E. T. COSPER.
COSPER of TuLi't. who while an Assemblyman
at the la-t ?es ? ion of- the Legislature broke his
pledges, betrayed his friends and wronged the
Republican party by casting his vote for Dan Burns
for the United States Senate, is now a candidate for
the office of Superior Judge. His candidacy gives the
jc^p'e of Tulare a good opportunity to pronounce
by their votes the judgment which honest men have
r i bis conduct. When a man who has been false to
one tni't asks 10 be trusted with duties even more im-
j k riant, it become? a matter of general concern that
prblic condemnation be made in a manner too em
phatic and too vigorous to be mistaken.
During the Senatorial contest Cosper pretended for
a long time to be among the firmest of those loyal
and honest Republicans who upheld the honor of the
party and refused to submit to the dictation of the
Southern Pacific Railroad. It was believed he could
be counted on to the end, and that when the victory
for the people had been won he would be among
the number of those to whom honor would be given.
The closing day of the regular session showed,
however, that Cosp;r had been plotting treason
all alonp:. He was. in fact, one - of the men
whom the Burns bosses boasted they had
"staked out" in the opposing. camp and whom they
cculd call over to Burns when the votes were needed.
On March 18. 1809. the final ballots of the reguhr
session for United States Senator were taken. The
Burns men saw defeat staring them in the face, and
:n order to gain time Dibble moved an adjournment
rntil the afternoon. The motion was lost. The bal
loting be^nn. and on the fourth ballot Cospcr descrte 1
the people and cast his vote for Burns.
At the time cf the desertion Cosper knew he had
violated his p!cdges r.nd broken faith with his con
stituents, and accordingly he hastened to write to his
home paper, the Tul.-.re Register, asking for a sus
pension of judgment upon his conduct. To. that
request the Register replied:
"It is not the policy of the Register to condemn
without a hearing, and yet we will not disguise the
fact that Mr. Cooper's voting for a man for United
States Senator who stands in the public mind as the
embodiment of all that is most objectionable in
American politics is st this time universally regarded
by Republicans of Tulare as a distinct betrayal of
tru*t. and certainly is proving a profound humiliation
to his party friends who supported him and main
tained to the last his entire trustworthiness in the
fr.ee of all criticism. Although the expressions of
opinion 50 far heard <ire that no explanation from Mr.
Copper is desired or will be listened to. we shall, with
out making comment at this time, place at his disposal
a reasonable space in the columns of the Register for
a reasonable time and ask on his behalf that con
siderate hearing which the law and an American sense
of fairness accord to all men accused of treason
against the bet interests of the State. Let him havi
his day at the court of public opinion."
To that fair and manly offer Cosper has never
openly and publicly replied. He may have made ex
planations to this man or to that man in private, but
hr ha* not publicly sliow'n any cause why he should
be acquitted of the charge of "treason against the
bevt interests of the State" by voting to elect to' the
United States Senate .-: man "who stands as the em
bodiment of all that is most objectionable in American
Cosper on the bench will not be more faithful than
Cosper in the Assembly. The powers tint handled
him a* Assemblyman will handle him as Judge. The
inducements" which led him in the Legislature to be
trny his constitccnts can ss easily induce him to be
tray ihe rights of litigants in court. In short, the
people of Tulare have tried Cosper and have found
him wanting in that strength cf character necessary to
resist the Southern Pacific Railroad. No such man
should be trusted upon the bench. The election of
such a man would be a wrong to every citizen who
has occasion to look ta the courts for the maintenance
of his rights against the aggressions of unscrupulous
Corporations or those who have their favor.
beneficent results. No: on the contrary.
Should it not be to fester those laws, pro- j
tect those people and that party which ;
brings such results?
This cry of imperialism which has been â¢
brought against the Republican party and \
Mr. McKinley is most unjust. The Dem- ,
ocrats, as we all know, almost forced the
country into this war, and the President j
was denounced beyond measure because j
he hung back so lonp and did not favor 1
war sooner, but after the Maine was j
blown up and our sailors killed in the
harbor of Havana there was hut one thing
to do. and that the President nmnfully i
did. Congress declared war and the result ;
is known to all. Admiral Dewey, with his
splendid little fleet, destroyed the Spanish !
in the bay of Manila, and the Spanish i
fleet on the Atlantic coast was equally j
annihilated, and no longer had we a foe !
to fight, but a suppliant asking for pence, I
p.nd in the settlement of that peace, '
which was ratified by Mr. Bryan and the j
Democratic party at the time, the islands j
of the Philippine archipelago were turned !
over to the American Government, and ]
because a few wicked and ambitious !
people of those islands who determined to ,
establish an oligarchy of their own raised i
the hand of warfare against the United j
States, attacked and shot our soldiers j
the President should not be blamed for
sustaining the power and authority of the
Government of the United States. Any
bellef that Republicans can harbor
thoughts of imperialism or harbor
thoughts against the perfect integrity and
liberty of our people is so utterly in con
tradiction to thtir whole character and
whole history that no person can for a
moment believe such thought. The Re
publican party was born for the purpose
of forwarding the cause of liberty, and Its
whole character from that time to this
has been that of liberty-loving people, and
the only opposers of liberty and civil
rights since the formation of this Govern
ment, I am sorry to say, have been in the
Democratic party, and this cry of imperi
alism against President McKinley by the
Democrats, who at this moment are dis
franchising the Southern negro, is a
wicked cry nnd withc-ut cause and made
for the purpose of deceiving the liberty
loving, people of our country-
I think the currency question has been
"fettled. I think our tariff laws are work
ing magnificently, and so far as I am
concerned I no longer hesitate to cast my
influence, whatever It may be. for the
continuance of the good times we are now
enjoying- and the party which caused It.
The man to whom more than all others
we owe thanks is William McKinley. I
believe him to be a pure man, a patriotic
citizen who loves his country and his fel
lows. These are some of my reasons for
no longer supporting Mr. W. J. Bryan.

Washington. E>. C, Sept. 20, 1900.
THE PORT COLLECTORSH1P
ONE of the most important Federal offices on
the Pacific Coast, that of the Collector of the
Port of San Francisco, is now vacant. There
will be of course many applicants for the po?ition,
and in making choice among them the President will
be guided by the advice given him by the Senators
liom California and by others who are acquainted
with the State, its people and its needs. It will be
well, therefore, for ail who may be solicited to recom
mend this or that aspirant to bear in mind the grave
duties of the office and the importance of having in
the position a man who is thoroughly capable of ful
filling them not only with fidelity but with an un
failing efficiency.
Let it be understood at the outset that The Call his
no candidate for the office. It has no aspirant to
support, and therefore has no opposition to any one
who has a fitness for the position. All that The Call
asks is that our Senators or any others who may make
recommendations to the President shall exercise a
proper regard for the dignity of the office and the wel
fare of the State, so that the appointee will be in
every way worthy of the duties intrusted to him.
For the right performance of the duties of the Col
lector of the Port- of San Francisco the incumbent
should be a big-brained, broad-gauge man. He should
be one of sufficient sagacity to be able to promptiy
detect any and every attempt at fraud, and of suffi
cient firmness to resist all the pressure that is sure to
be brought to bear upon him to connive at violations
of the law in one form or another.
Such a man can easily be found among the Repub
licans of California, antf no one who falls below that
standard should be recommended to the President.
San Francisco is one of the most important ports of
the nation, and its relative importance is rapidly in
creasinp;. Every movement made toward the exten
sion of commerce in the Orient gives San Francisco
greater prominence in the commercial world. None
can deny that a man of far more than ordinary ci*
pacity is needed to fulfill the duties of the collector
ship. No man of any other fort should be recom
mended by our Senators or our people. We repeat
The Call has no particular candidate^*a-urge for the
place, nor any interest in the struggle for the posi
tion other than that of all good citizens. The one de
sire is to see the ounce under the control of a man
"who can be relied upon to perform all of its duties
with honor to himself, credit to the Republican party
and benefit to the public.

UP-TO-DATE
EDITORIAL
UTTERANCE
BRYAN ON SEVERAL THINGS.
w
r^ OLONEL BRYAN'S letter of acceptance was
l^ in the nature of a wet blanket. It consisted of
a running commentary on the Kansas City
platform, very dull end commonplace in its phrase
ology. It has as much flavor as a wet sponge and as
much sparkle as a dab of tar.
In no part of it does his capacity for misrepresen
tation appear in a higher light than in discussion of
what he calls government by injunction. On this head
he said: " While whit is known as government by in
junction is at present directed chiefly against the em
ployes of corporations when there is a disagreement
between them and their employer, it involves a prin
ciple that concerns every one. The purpose of the in
junction in such cases is to substitute trial by Judge
for trial by jury, and Is a covert blow at the jury sys
tem. The abolition of government by injunction is
as necessary for the protection of the reputation of
the court as it is for the security of the citizen."
It is very difficult to crowd more falsehood ?.nd
misrepresentation into that many words.
The injunction is appealed to as the most direct
and efficacious means of securing judicial protection
to the rights of property. It is not appealed to and
has never been appealed to in any legitimate dis
agreement between employer and employed involving
a question of wages or hours of labor. It is incapable
of application to any such disagreement and cannot be
invoked by either side to such a controversy. It is
a writ. long founded in the law. to protect the rights
of property, and is inapplicable to any such issue.
For instance, an employe cannot be enjoined perma
nently from leaving his employment or changing from
one employer to another. That would be infringe
ment of personal rights. Xor can an employe who
lias left his job enjoin the employer from giving it
to another. These things involve personal liberty
it; the highest sense, and the injunction cannot be ap
plied to them. But when a combination of men, un
der any pretext, claim the privilege of entering upon
the property of another, arid by their presence and
force preventing^ him from its legitimate use and con
trol, his rights of property may be properly sheltered
under a permanent injunction. So, also, when a man
claims the right to so use his property as to destroy
t'ie property of another, or block a common law ease
ment of any kind, the property threatened may shelter
under an injunction. Of the use of this writ to pro
tect property we have/he familiar illustration in Cali
fornia of Judge Sawyer's perpetual injunction against
hydraulic mining wh;n its operation fills the streams
with slickens and destroys the valley farms and the
navigability of rivers. The Sacramento Valley lives
under government by injunction. When the injunc
tion is violated it is contempt of the court that issued
the writ, and that court inflicts the punishment and
protects, directly anl immediately, the endangered
property. Colonel Bryan denounces this ''as a blow
at the jury system." The constitution provides that
a person charged with n capital or otherwise infamous
crime shall be tried by a jury of the district or vicin
ity in which the offense was committed. Colonel
Bryan is incapable of distinguishing between a capi
tal or otherwise infamous crime and contempt of
court. Either he is ignorant of the difference or de
liberately misrepresents. Crime involves moral tur
pitude and infamy. "Contempt of court does not.
But Bryan says: "If the criminal laws are not suffi
cient for the protection of property they can be made
more severe, but a citizen charged with crime must
have his case tried by a jury of his peers."
To call such stuff :ot is to dignify it. It is worse
than rot.
Equally defective and misleading is his discussion
of the Monroe doctrine. In his platform and
speeches it is demanded that we extend the Monroe
doctrine to Asia. In the celebrated special session of
Congress which he says he will call, if elected, he
proposes Mich a protectorate over the Philippines as
we have over the countries of Central and South
America "under the Monroe doctrine." We have no
protectorate in this hemisphere under the Monroe
doctrine. A protectorate can exist only by prior as
sent of both parties. The one protected must seek
and the protector must grant it. This hemisphere
was not consulted when the Monroe doctrine was an
nounced. It was this country's answer to the chal
lenge of the IToly Alliance. It is a declaration that
any attempt to plant or enlarge the monarchical in
ftitutions of Europe in this hemisphere is regarded
as unfriendly to the United States. Instead of estab
lishing a protectorate over other countries it deprives
them of the right to consent to transfer their alle
giance to a European sovereignty.
For instance, if the Brazilians should decide unani
mously to transfer their allegiance to their blood re
lations, the Portuguese, and to accept the sovereignty
of the house of Braganza. all voluntarily consenting
thereto, under the Monroe doctrine we would deny
them that right and would by force prevent their en
joyment of it. which Mr. Bryan will please observe
would be denying to them the consent of the gov
erned.
Colonel Bryan declares that, denial of the policy
of a protectorate is an assault on the Monroe doc
trine, while at the same time he proposes to destroy
the Monroe doctrine by a Quixotic attempt to make
it globular instead of hemispherical, and lifting it out
of its legitimate locus to spread it over Asia.
His discussion of these two things in his letter of
acceptance is that of ?. charlatan, and is another illus
tration of the shallow and illogical quality of his mind.
is room in their system for the gratification of . ail
worthy ambitions, the risk of change by revolution
will grow constantly less, and we may well anticipate
the rise just below our southern horizon of a republic
that is worthy to write upon its bow of promise the
motto esto perpetua, which is the inspiration of our
own perpetuity. Insular peoples are always patriotic,
and the island will feel the thrill of love of country
common to men whose land is girdled by the sea.
A well applied public school system will assimilate
her people in a common civic mass, and her long
tragedy will be forgotten in the peace, happiness and
prosperity of her future.
ORGANIZER OF THE SILVER KNIGHTS
OF AMERICA DESERTS BRYAN
Will Support the Party That Has Given the
Country the Prosperity It Is
Enjoying.
COLONEL OLIVER C. SABIN of
"Washington, D. C, who organized
the Silver Knights of America and
was the first secretary of that or
ganization, has deserted Bryan. Colonel
Sahin . was an active supporter - of Mr.
Bryan in the campaign of 1S96, but. now
he has announced that he will advocate
the re-election of President McKinley.
lie gives his reasons in the following
statement:
Editor San Francisco Call: Four years

country depended upon the remonetiza
tlon of silver and its equal coinage with
gold at the ratio of 16 to 1 in order to
give .us more money. Our nation at that
time and our people were debtors: busi
ness was paralyzed, and manufactories
had almost ceased work throughout
the entire United States, caused, as I
believed then and do now, by a system
Â«f contraction In our circulation medium
fcr money, and the Wilson tariff bill. The
Republican administration has solved
these problems and to-day we have more
money in circulation per capita than we
have ever had In the history of our Gov
ernment. We had 'esa four years aso.
Owing: to /the influence of the Dingley
tariff bill the - wheels of our commerce
have been set in motion, manufactories
everywhere are busy, opportunity for la
bor is abundant, and instead of our coun
try being filled with tramps (honest men
unable to obtain employment) labor Is
now looking for workmen and better
wages are being paid than is paid by any
other people on the face of the earth, ft
would seem to me that any person with
ordinary good sense ahould see that these
conditions ought to continue. So far as I
am concerned I care nothing about party
lines. I want to see those policies carried
out which will give us prosperity and
place the people in the enjoyment of those
blessings which God intended we should
have, and under this Republican adminis
tration we are getting that nearer than
we have ever had before. Mr. Bryan Is a
free-trader and you take the application
of his principles as tested, for Instance, In
England, and we see that, according to
the census of the United Kingdom, includ
ing England, Scotland. Ireland and Wales,
tpr the year of 1S90 there was one regis
tered pauper for every thirty-five Inhabi
tants, while in the United States, despite
the enormous foreign (migration, we had
but one pauper to every five hundred in
habitants, showing clearly that our sys
tem of protecting American workmen by an
American tariff Is the only system which
will bring prosperity to our people; that
is, the people who work with their hands.
Politics should be governed the same a3
a wise business man governs his business
affairs. If we see a man who is always
buying more than he sells and selling for
less than the cost price that man is sure
to fail; whereas we see a man who sells
at a profit and manufactures at a profit
is sure to rise. There is nothir g mys
terious in politics; there is nothing niys
terlous in governmental affairs; all we
have to do is to apply the ordinary prin
ciples of good sense and then follow and
let our votes register our beliefs. If we
believe in encouraging pauperism. If we
believe in the hard times we had prior
to this American tariff, then vote for the
party which caused hard times. It will
not do to say that all the hard times of
the Cleveland administration belonged to
those Democrats who were Clevelandites
as represented by Mr. Cleveland, for that
is not true. The Wilson tariff bill was
passed by a Democratic Congress and Mr.
Bryan himself is thoroughly opposed to
the protection of American workmen.
Then again, if we look at the present
prosperous condition of the country
everywhere and compare it with any
period of the Government which has ever
existed before, we find that our prosper
ity Is Infinitely greater than it has ever
been. We find that our workmen are
more universally employed and at better
wages and shorter hours than ever In our
history. Thon I ask what Is the duty of
the man who loves his fellow citizen and
who wishes to see the one who works
paid? Surely it cannot be to strike down
the system of laws which protects the
workmen and brings about all these

His boyhood's home is but little changed
âa beautiful old house of the kind which
rich Tories lived â¢ In' then and which we
are apt In New England to call colonial
Had hammered stone for life in Concord Jail
Lowell would cross-question the old ne
ero who remembered Earl Percy's march
from Cambridge bridge to Lexington:
Old Joe Is dead, 'who saw proud Percy goad
His slow artillery up the Concord road.
And he tells how that tale grew from year
to year, so that if the old white-haired
negro could have lived a little longer.
Vanquished Percy, to complete the tale.
Lowell was born within a mile of
Holmes' birthplace ten years after him.
He never remembered a time when he did
not know Holmes, and he was among the
eager group of boys who heard with de
light Holmes' Phi Beta Kappa poem.
Those who are familiar with the writings
of both will remember the enthusiasm
with which they always turn back to their
Cambridge memories.
Dear Hale: The idea of a Phi Beta dinner
without my reading some verse la ridiculous. I
have a good motif already and have the poem
half written. I shall come and shall expect
to speak. Observe, I shall be very angry with
you. if you do not call me up.
So. as the man said who could not make
Clay's speeches but who once held his hat
when he made one, I can boast that I
have contributed one of Holmes' poems to
our college literature.
That would be a good working history of
this country from 1831 to 1S96 which could
be made from Holmes' poems. Lowell's
and Whittier's, with a few from Bryant.
Emerson and Longfellow. The "Biglow
Papers" would come In, of course; >Irs.
Howe's "Battle Hymn" and six or eight
good marching songs of the civil war. To
this anthology, perhaps. Holmes would
furnish the most. But the best of our his
torical ballads. In fact one of the best of
the modern ballads, none of which are
true ballads, is Longfellow's ballad of the
French fleet.
Holmes and Lowell were ten years apart
In age. Holmes liked to say that 1^09. the
year of his birth, was 100 years after the
date of Sam Johnson's birth. He pretend
ed to regard it as an "annus mlrabilis." It
was the year in which Gladstone was
born. This was always In a sort of bub
bling fun, in which he was at his best, In
which there was not the least fleck of con
ceit or vanity. He and Lowell were both
Cambridge boy3, and in a way were able
to link together personally the old war
days of 1775 with the war days of 1861. In
the Cambridge gardens of those days
were, as there are now. the wrecks of
Putnam's and Ward's intrenchments. We
used to point out staples in the ceiling In
Massachusetts hall from which we pre
tended that soldiers' hammocks hung
when the college buildings were barracks.
At West Cambridge they showed bullets
of the day of Lexington in the timbers pf
the wooden houses.
I may say in passing that I have often
been at one or another dinner party where
he spoke, where the audience made him
stand in his chair or even on the table
so that they might see him and hear him
the better. And, indeed, one does not
know his odes at their best unless one has
heard him deliver them. I will not say re
cite or declaim them, for it was always
above and beyond recitation and declama
tion.
He loved Cambridge and the college and
all college festivals with genuine and In
imitable enthusiasm. When we were both
well forward I had, as I said, by accident
to preside at a dinner of Phi Beta Kappa.
In making sure of the right people for
guests I wrote to Holmes and asked him
to remember the day, to which request I
received a very funny answer. He could
not come and would not. He was tired of
being tapped for verses, like a cider cask
for cider, whenever an anniversary came
round. He would not respond to such calls
any longer. To which I replied at once:
"Who said anything about verses? Not I!"
I was embarrassed with riches already. I
had Longfellow and both Qulncys. and I
know not how many others. But the boys
would want to see him, and all that I
wanted of him was to sit* at the cross
table and let them look at him; he need
not say a word. As quick as the two let
ters could go and come I had his answer.
It read something like this:
The little man answered tho call for
"Holmes! Holmes!" and recited that very
funny poem:
And who was In the catalogue
When college flm begun?
Two nephews of the president
And the professor's son.
Sometimes the entering class was small.
And sometimes there was none.
Lord! How the seniors kicked about
That freshman class of one. .
But when I saw him first our conditions
were reversed. It was in 1S36, and I was
in college. His reputation was assured
now. He was the young poet of the time.
People knew what he could do, and to us
boys he was the representative of young
Harvard. So, as we all sat among 20uo
graduates and undergraduates In the
largest pavilion ever heard of on the two
hundredth anniversary of "fair Har
vard's" birth, he was our hero among the
great men of the occasion. Webster,
Everett, Story, Shaw â these were great
men; but we wanted to hear Holmes, and
for us he bore away the laurels.
Well, my mother . was always on the
lookout for "pieces" for us boys to speak
when Saturday came round, and so
Holmes' ode was cut out from the paper
and I was made to learn it and to speak
it. That was the way In which in those
days boys learned by heart "Scots wha
hae," "Nelson and the North," "Down to
the Dust With Them," "The Turk Was
Dreaming of the Hour" and other like
lyrics which did them no harm. And
thus I first knew the name of Oliver Wen
dell Holmes. I used to tell him after
ward that I was the first of a million boys
and girls to repeat his lines on the school
room stage, and I think he liked me the
better for it.
Holmes was a lad of 21. He took the
cde, hot from his pen, to the office of the
Daily Advertiser, of which paper my
father was the editor. Of course the Ad
vertiser published the poem. It flew all
over the country. The "harpies of the
land" were frightened, cowed and blinded,
and the order was revoked. The Con
stitution is afloat to-day. We saved her
from Annapolis in the days of the rebel
lion, and now she. lies a shrine for wor
ship in Boston harbor, as the vessel of
Theseus lay at Athens.
The lightning: and the pale.
So the order was given that Old Iron
sides, as she was cahed familiarly, should
be broken up. This order roused Oliver
Wendell Holmes with a theme worthy of
him. He went up Into his little attic room
in the old Cambridge parsonage, the house
which was General Ward's neadquarters
in the. siege of Boston. On the roadway
below Prescott's regiments had formed
on their way to Bunker Hill, and tne par
son had offered prayers to the god of bat
tle. Holmes shut himself Into his litUe
room and wrote his immortal ode:
Nail to the mast her holy flag.
Spread every threadbare sail.
And give her to the God of storms.
With an ingenuity almost Machiavel
lian, the Secretary of the Navy, whoever
he was, acting in this amiable view, an
nounced that the Government was goins
to break up the frigate Constitution,
called for convenience "The Old Frig
ate." In truth, she was hardly thirty
years old; she had been launched in Boa
ton. In a generation she had revolution
ized naval warfare. She had fought with
success in many battles; she had escaped
as by a miracle from hostile fleets. But
she was a John Adams frigate, Massa
chusetts built and Massachusetts sailed.
To break her up before a generation of
the men who built her had died. Just as
the younger Adams had been turned out
of office, would be a good token that the
reign of the Adamses of New England
was Indeed finished.
It must have been in 1S30 that I first
heard the name of Oliver Wendell
Holmes. I was a little boy seven or eight
years old. The country had just turned
out John Quincy Adams from the Presi
dency. The Southern oligarchy, which, by
taking a Western candidate and electing
a Western President, had put New Eng
land upon the back seats again, sought
some fit opportunity to slap New England
in the face.
At that time I was very intimate with
him personally. I saw him almost every
day of his life, and I like to testify to the
firm habit of work which he had already
formed, which as an underlying founda
tion is responsible for his success in life.
Do not let any of the young authors who
read this think they are to work spas
modically or when the fancy takes them.
He says somewhere that he gave fifteen
hours a day to his duties as an editor.
It is impossible to attempt here any de
tail of Lowell's work. These papers do
not lnvol\'e any study of his methods or
of the secret of his successes. It la
enough to say that for the period of the
Civil War and the years which followed
it his literary life is all mixed up with
the life of a conscientious leader of the
people. He was editor of the Atlantic
Monthly and of the North American Re
viev.'âsometimes editor of both at the
same time. Besides the regular work of
an editor he was writing forcible articles
on the duties of the men of the freÂ«
States. If poetry helped In this work he
wrote poetry. If men needed prose he
wrote prose.
It Is one of the good traditions of our
Government that In Europe we shall be
represented by some men who have won
their spurs in literature. Mr. Lowell,
however, declined all the four great for
eign missions â Russia. France. Germany
and England. But he said to somebody in
private that if they had offered him Spain
he thought he could not have resisted the
temptation. Such an expression was, of
course, repeated in Washington, and the
Government "at once offered him Spain."
He Â¦went to Spain, and they found. I nave
sometimes supposed to their great sur
prise, that they got businesslike letters
from him of great value and Interest. It
was the time when Spain had Just offend
ed us. and Mr. Lowell's business was con
ciliation. So satisfactory was his work
as a diplomatist in Spain that to his sur
prise he was offered our mission to Eng
land when there was a vacancy. He ful
filled his duties there with remarkable
success.
Some of h!s public addresses, especially
that on democracy, may be spoken of as
standard statements of what a republic
means and what it stands for. I have
been clad to see that the address an
democracy is used as a textbook in the
classes in some of our better colleges.
EDWARD E. HALE.
Roxbury, Mass.
I am fond of telling this story because }t
shows definitely the early period at which
he had impressed us all with a sense of
his power.
Mr. Hlgginson, In his charming- remin
iscences of that time, says he remembers
the interest with which the boys of his
own age heard that James Lowell wa3
not going to be a lawyer, but was going
to be a poet. The mere idea that any
body in the world should say that poetry
was to be his vocation and that other
work was to be what people like to call
an avocation in these days surprised and
interested a set of bright fellows like
young Hlgginson and his companions.
But without anything like arrogance this
determination was made. That Is to say,
after he had studied lawâ studied It care
fully â and had opened an oClce in good
faith, to show his friends that he was not
beyond wcrk or above it, Lowell deter
mined that he would give himself to lit
erature as his duty.
He corresponded with the Journals most
advanced in the politics of that time â
which meant with the anti-slavery Jour
nals. Some of his best work was written
for them, and it is quite worth whtle for
the youns gentlemen and ladles who are
reading this to try to hunt up In the flies
of the old newspapers of that day papers
of his which have not been brought to
gether In collections of his published
writings.
That was pretty grave news to tell an
affectionate father about a son greatly
beloved and dear old Dr. Lowell met It
by saying: "Oh, James promised me that
he would quit writins poetry and. wouU
go to work!"
I am afraid that most fathers at W
years would be glad if any son of IS or 19
would promise to "quit writing poetry
and to go to work." But all the same one
is glad in this particular case that the
country and the world did not lose "Sir
Launfal" and the "Mglow Papers" and
many others like them because a fond
father hoped that a dear son would "quit
writing poetry."
The story belongs here as one begins
to write about Lowell. It involves a cer
tain moral. It suggests the competition
between the goddess of work, whoever she
may be, and a half dozen other miMea,
more or less, who preside on such poetry
as theirs, a competition which affected
the life of Lowellâ as ot Holmes- 1 think
not unfavorably.
Some year3 ago in his own absence In
Europe it fell to me oy accident to pre
side in his place at the annual dinner of
the Phi Beta Kappa at Cambridge. Ths
Phi Deta Kappa Society exists only for
the purpose of holding these dinner par
ties and they are very good fun. There li
a certain rule, stern as those of tha
Medes and Persians, that no word of the
after-dinner speaking shall ever go Into
print, so that you have men of every sort
of frame ready to talk to each other with
the freedom of so many sophomores at %
college dinner table. In maktr.s my prep
arations for this dinner party the advice
was given me, with a certain bitterness,
that I should not "trot out the old war
horses." To which I replied: "Really,
the 'old -war horses' are not a bad set. I
can have Longfellow and Charles France
Adams- and Holmesâ and all but Lowell.
And let me tell you that the oay Lowell
graduated we knew as well as we know
now that he was going to be one of the
leading poets of his time. If you will tell
me who is going to be the leading poet of
his time among the youngsters who will
graduate here next Wednesday I will call
him out."
houses. His mother was not in strong
health and his training fell much into the
hands of an older sister, a charming
woman, who seems to have known early
that she had a poet in her charge. At all
events the training was just such as yon
and I might be glad that a poet should
have. Lowell's love of nature is noi In
the least manufactured and his acquaint
ance with hangbirdd and bluejays and
brown thrushes is the friendship of Â«*
man who hail known them from his child
hood. So in skating on Fresn pond, in
tracing up Beaver brook and In the free
dom and ease of his knowledge of tre?9
and flowers we findâ I do not say a coun
try boy, but a boy who has been brought
up in the open air.
There is an amusing but pathetic story
about Loweirs fortunes in college whlert
has a lesson so important tlrat I believa
5t is worth repeating. I say this because
the person who himself put it in circula
tion was evidently proud of his own part
in it. This gentleman was in Rome in tha
spring of 13G3 when Dr. Charles Lowell,
the fa'her of the poet, was there. "I
heard that Dr. Lowell had not received
his American letters and as I had mini*
I thought I would go round and see him.
So I said to him that I had my letter*.
And he asked me what was the Cam
bridge news. And I told him that my
brother was to have the first oration ac
the college commencement. And I told
him that his son James had been 'rusti
cated' â that is, suspended from collect
and sent into the country in exile to work
with a clerical tutor. But I told him the
class had chosen James to be the clasj
poet."

Owners of the Forest Home Enter
tain Their Friends on Board.
The owners of the handsome new four
masted schooner. Forest Home, held a
reception on board yesterday. Among
those who were present to drink a glass
of wine in honor of the new craft were
Phil Teller. John English, Dan Keere, "W.
S. Davis, Ben Gunn, F. II. McCormick,
Lewis E. Spear, E. P. Danforth, S. J.
Shannon. J. R. Folsom, Captain Metcalf,
J. C Faseoe. R. II. Swayne, John Hoyte,
\\". J. Wood&ide and many ladies. The
affair was a most enjoyable one, and if
half the wishes come true the Forest
Home should pay a 10 per cent dividend
within the next six months.
The Forest Home is 190 feet Ions:, 40
feet beam and 15 feet 3 inches deep. She
can carry one million feet of lumber.
From here she goes to Puget Sound to
load lumber for Callao or Valparaiso,
and at the South American port she will
load nitrate cither for San Francisco or
Honolulu. Captain McArthur goes out In
command of the Forest Home.
A Transport Returns.
The German horse transport Nurnberg
had to rtturn to anchorage yesterday. She
was to have sailed with about 500 horses
and mules, but when on" Lime Point the
pilot decided the vessel was top heavy
The horses were all below and the hay
and fodder on deck.
The transport was brought back to an
anchorage and 400 tons of pig iron was
put in her hold, after which she went to
sea. In all the months that Uncle Sam
has been running transports out of San
Francisco not one has been compelled to
return. The Nurnberg is the second of
the .Kaiser's vessels to put back.
A Navy Collier.
The Justin came down from the navy
yard yesterday. She carries a full cargo
of coal and is prepared to go to either
China or the Philippines. The chances are
that she will sail for Manila via Honolulu
and Guam to-day. Captain Scott, who is
in command of the Justin, was formerly
In command of the Laurada. That cranky
craft made several voyages, but a month
after Captain Scott left her she was piled
up on the Prybiloff Islands in order to
save the passengers and crew.
"Water Front Notes,
The bark Nicholas Thayer, from Bristol
Bay, was placed In quarantine yesterday.
During the run down the coast three Chi
nese died and the quarantine officer want
ed to make sure that none of the fatalities
were from a contagious disease.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
Curacao arrived from Mexican ports yes
terday. She made the run from Guaymas
in ten days and brought a number of pas
seogers, but no news of importance.
C. II. Critchley of the bark Mohican met
with a peculiar accident yesterday. While
the cargo was beinsr sent down the chute
he srot in the way of a sack of shorts and
the result was a fmcture of the right leg
in two places. He was attended to at I he
Harbor Hospital by Drs. Robinson and
Bauer.
HANDSOME NEW SCHOONER.
THE most notable arrival yester
day was the now famous steamer
Samoa. According to stories sent
from Nome by The Call's special
correspondent and confirmatory
telegrams from Seattle, the Samoa must
have had a lively time of it on the Sibe
rian coast. Of the story hardly anything
remains to be told.
The Samoa brought down the following
passengers: George D. Roberts, Jesse R.
Grant. Mrs. M. E. Meyers, Mrs. G. W.
Bremer, J. B. Landfleld Jr., F. Rickard,
Walter B. Wlllett. P. Stanton, M. R.
Armstrong. Henry F. Ross, Lewis J.
Ross, S. V. Swasey. J. H. Mercer, W. J.
Stone and Don R. Dunbar.
Captain Jahnsen in talking: about the
trip yesterday said:
"I think there is plenty of gold on the
Siberian coast and the Russians know it.
Count Bogdanovitch's intention was to
seize our vessel and hold us there, but
Roberts fooled them. After leaving the
Alaskan coast we went as far north as
67 deg. 30 min. On the beach good results
were procured and then came along the
Russian revenue cutter Yakut. During
the night thirty or forty Chinese and Cos
sacks from that boat were put aboard the
Samoa. There is a Russian law, you
know, that makes it impossible for any
body save Cossacks and Chinese to work
on the Siberian coast.
"This all happened at Kailiutchln, and
the first thine we knew was that the
Cosacks had brought aboard their uni
forms and arms and ammunition. Then
Iiogdanovitch claimed the Samoa as a
Russian transport, and Captain Roberts
i and I entered most vigorous protest.
There was a passage of arms, particulars
of which have already been published,
! and then Count Bogdanovitch removed
$25,000 in gold, a lot of mining machinery
and ships' stores to the Yakut and we
started back for Cape Nome. They left
Â¦ us 311st enough provisions to reach our
destination.
"When we were in Clover Bay Captain
Roberts and Count Bogdanovitch had a
quarrel, and the latter came near to
losing the number o* his mess. Seeing
j there was likely to be trouble, I armed
my crew, but the Cossacks took water
and. as you know, the matter blew over.
It was an exciting little incident while
it lasted, but it is all over now. Just the
fame, there is plenty of gold on the Sibe
rian coast."

The American people, valiant in arms, ar.d
wise in peace, will not select ajÂ§ commar.der in
chief of their army and navy a maji with Mr.
Bryan's pusUlanizsoas conception of duty. I
firmly believa that the American voters will in
November next maintain at the ballot-box the
fact that this is a goverr.ir.ent by and for the
people, and not for ccwards: that our flag shall
b* honored abroad as well as at home: that
wherever on earth an American lawfully walks
his life ar.d property will be protected from for
eipn attacks by the<cannon of. our warshir.s and
the bay: nets of our soldiers. [
It is clear that President McKinley has mere
ly followed the American policy of expansion
which commenced with Washington and has
continued to be the policy of the whole Amer
ican nation. Hence it is manifest that all of
this Bryar.lstic declaration apainet expansion.
or so-called imperial i?m. Is not made in good
faith, and is oppotd to the sound principles
of the true f>emocratic party, the represeuta
tivej. of which were seduced ly Mr. Bryan at
Kansas City into declaring acainFt the true
jTinoir.les of Democracy and humbuKjred into
rtaf firniinj? the offensive | rinciples of the Chi
cajro "latfc.rm of 1RS6. which were that, year
buried by the voters of the United Ptates. and
which they will not resurrect in 1S0O to poison
American atmosphere.
Let us tell Mr. Bryan he need never fear mili
tarism while our eoldicrs are selected from
American honK-!". from American fathers, hus
bands, sons ar.d brother?. The false and un
worthy arp'fcration of the words Imperialism
and militarism to our illustrious President is
not new in the history of American politics.
Washington was in his lime, reviled by petty
partisan's. Notwithstanding his self-sacriflce
and life's devotion to his country, he was re
viled as a monarchist. Lincoln, the patriot,
emancipator ar.d martyr, was also denounced as
through the lips of the assassin as he dealt the
death blow to the noble President.
city these charges of the past, made apalnst
â¢Washington. Lincoln and Grant, and now re
vived by Bryanitee under the terms of imt>Â«
ria'.ifm "and militarism acainst President Mc-
Ktr.loy. are equally hollow, bastless and fia
prant assaults upon a noble and honest Presi
dent, who^e patriotism and devotion to our re
history have rendered his administration one
of the most glorious in the annals of American
history.
ThÂ«- financial cost of the suppression of the
Tacalo revolt is not to be an obstacle to
American reprisals for the loss of American
lives. AÂ« it was our duty to invade Spanish
territory In war, at all cost, so It was like
wise our duty at tho close of the Spanish war
to svoorws all revolts of whatsoever people
B^air.si American rights at whatever cost of
American money or deplorable loss of life.
That the Stars and Stripes shall be orotected,
has be~n. and forever will be. the policy of the
ijreat I-.vuubltcan party.
But Mr. Bryan constantly asserts that thÂ»
Philli'j.lne war i* unjustifiable, and attempts
to n ach the :>rejudlces of the multitude by
rrlÂ«?rÂ»-r.<e to the sad loss of human life, as

It Is but the final price paid fcr the perfect

Collector of the Port.
The contest for the office of Collector
of the Port, to succeed Colonel John P.
Jackson, seems to be narrowing down to
Joseph S. Spear and W. B. Hamilton.
Major Frank McLauRhlin says he has not
been offered the position and that if it
were tendered him he would not accept.
He remarked yesterday that he would
never accept a public office.
It is believed that Senators Bard and
Perkins will hold an early conference to
consider the merit of the various aspir
ants. Among the names mentioned for
Collector, other than Ppear and Hamilton,
are Stanley Jackson. E. B. Jerome. Georee
Stone. John T. Dare and William Bel
lingall.

Corporation Defends Pierce.
The Blue Lakes Water Company filed
answer yesterday to the action recently
instituted by James E. Damon. The de

for refusing to keep any agreement with

Captains Polks and Bolger, United
States inspectors of local and foreign ves
sels, filed iheir re-port yesterday afternoon
in the matter of the loss of the ship May
Flint. They suspended her master, Cap
tain A. M. \Yo"d.Â«ir!e. for twelve months
for unsklll fulness. The inspectors' report.
after reciting- the circumstances of the
disaster, goes on to bay:
"Captain Woodside testified that he did
not anchor in the lower harbor because
there were a number of vessels anchored
there and b'-cause he thought he could
get a tug at any moment. He testified
also that had hÂ»> known he could not
have securer! one he would have anchored
the ship below rr <.!T Meigrss wharf, but
he did not stop to sis:ial for a tug at any
time nor request one of the Merchants'
Exchange boats. wMch snoke Ivm off .-aid
wharf. Captain Woods'de tostlfie-i fur
ther that b<* had never before brought
a ship into this port ur.dcr sail.
"After a careful consideration of the
evidence in this c<Â»sf we ar.) of the opinion
that Captain A. M. Wcdslde was unskill
ful in navlgatlm; the May Flint, a lr>rs:e
ship deeply loaded! Â°n the nfsht of Sep
tember 8, 1900, In sailinp her up the har
bor of San Francisco, along: the oltv front
near the wharves, p.monp: the shipping
after nightfall, with a strong flood t'dÂ«v
taking 1 the chances of either the wind
holding strong enough to handle the ship
or of getting a tug.
"Therefore, under authorltv of section
4450, United States Revised Statutes, for
reason of such urskiHfulnejs on the part
of Captain Woodside, we have this day
suspended his license as master of sailing
vessels of over 700 tons pross for the pe
riod of twelve months.
'â¢The May Flint is a total loss and was
valued at SJO.iW). her cargo at (35,000; and
the bark Vidette sustained damage to the
extent of $3000."

pain across the back and thighs. I
felt as though there was a heavy
weight in my stomach all the time.
I have taken two bottles of the medi-
cine, and now have better health than
I have had for four years."
Mna. Lizzie Dicksos Hodge,
Avalon, Ohio.
"I cannot say enough in regard to L>ydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Componnd.
It has done me more good than all the doctors. I have been troubled with
female weakness in its worst form for about ten years. I had leucorrhoea
and was so weak that I could not do my housework.
I also had falling' of the womb and inflammation of the Â¦womb and ovaries,
and at menstrual periods I suffered terribly. At times my back would ache
very hard. I could not lift anything or do any heavy work ; was not able to
stand on my feet long at a time. My husband spent hundreds of dollars for
doctors but they did me no good. My husband's sister wrote what the Vege-
table Compound had done for her, and wanted me to try it, but I did not then
think it would do me any good. After a time, I concluded to try it, and I can
truly say it does all that is claimed for it. Ten bottles of the Vegetable Com-
and seven packages of Sanative Wash have made a new woman of me, I have
had no worfrb trouble since taking the fifth bottle. I weigh more than I have
in years : can do all my own housework, sleep well, have a pood appetite, and
now feel that life is worth living. I owe all to Lydla E. Pinlcham's Veg-
etable Compound. I feel that it has saved my life and would not be with-
out it for anything. I am always glad to recommend it to all my sex, for I
know if they will follow Mrs. Pinkham's directions, they will be cured."

Denied the Writ.
The Supreme Court yesterday denied the
application for a writ ol prohibition, filed
by Attorneys Heller and Powers in behalf
of I. W. Hellman Jr. and William Gisel
man, charged with contempt by Judg a
Troutt. On September 26 an order wa3
made by Judge Troutt in the estate of
William C. Piper directing the executors
to pay $269,000 over to A. A. Sanderson
and Denton C. Piper, legatees. The fol
lowing day I. W. Hellman Jr.. represent
ing the Union Trust Company, and Wil
liam Giselman asked the court for sixty
days' time in which to pay the amount
and they were cited by Judge Troutt to
appear and show cause why they should
not be adjudged guilty of contempt. The
writ was filed yesterday and within half
an hour after it was presented to the
court a decision was rendered denying it.
JOHN WIELAND BREWERY
LEADS.
The John Wieland Brewery of San
Francisco, brewers of the well-known
Wleland's Extra Pale Lager, have just
received advice under date of August 28,
1900, from Mr. Varney W. Gaskill. secre
tary of the California Paris Exposition
Commission of 1900, that the International
Jury of Awards have awarded them a
certificate and medal for the exhibit they
made at the Paris Exposition of their
"Wleland's Extra Pale Lager."
This announcement Is one that not alone
the brewery but the State of California
as well may be justly proud of. for it
gives to a very popular California indus
try an international reputation. The John
Wieland Brewery is known as the largest
brewery west of the Rocky Mountains.
The award was based on purity and fla
vor, and when it is considered that this
enterprising company was entered in this
exposition against competitors from the
entire worldâ Europe as well as Americaâ
their success is gratifying in the extreme.
GREAT SUCCESS FOR THE
STATE OF CALIFORNIA ! !
KEPT TOOLS AS SECURITY
FOR BROKEN FALSE TEETH
Shirtmakers Have a Fight, Resulting
in Issuance cf a Search
Warrant.
Jam^p L. Nunan and L. Brown worked
hÂ«= shirtmakers at 220 McAllister street.
Yesterday mnrr.injr they had a dispute and
Nunan struck Brown on the mouth,
breaking two of his false teeth. Nunan
then wanted to get his tools, as he in
ier>..ir-d to remove to another place, but
Hrown locked them up and refused to de
liver them unless Nunan supplied him
with a r.ew set of false teeth.
Nunan secured a search warrant from
Judge Caban5sp yesterday afternoon and
his tools were recovered and taken to the
office of the property clerk pending the
decision of tho <ase to-day. Later Rrown
went to th<? warrant clerk and explained
that he was willing to hand over the tools
and -would make no contest in court.
HE DISLOCATED HIS
THYROID CARTILAGE
Singular Accident That Happened to
C. Prado by Quickly Turning
His Head.
C. Prado. 1543 Dupont street, met with
j an accident yesterday afternoon which is
; perhaps without a precedent in medical
j history, at least Dr. Starr of the Receiv
: Ing Hospital, who attended to the case,
! says he never heard of a similar one.
I Prado works as a packer in a warehouse
j on Market street. He happened to turn
his head quickly yesterday afternoon
while at work and a bone seemed to rise
! in his throat. He could not swallow and
1 suffered considerable pain. He hurried to
â¢ the hospital, and Dr. Starr after making
' an examination of his throat was sur
! prised to discover that the thyroid carti
1 lage, or, as it is commonly known, "Ad
j am'a apple," was dislocated, as well as the
j glands surrounding the trachea. The doc-
I tor made a tourniquet, and after pressing
I the cartilage in position so that Prado
Â¦ rould t wallow bound it tightly in position.
Â¦ Prado will have to be careful for some
time, and even then a quick turn of his
head may lead to a repetition of the dislo
cation.
"It's the most extraordinary case I ever
heard of," said I>r. Starr. "In all my ex
perience I never knew or heard of the
thyroid cartilage being dislocated, and in
such a simple manner. It was lucky for
the man that he was so near the hos
pital."
MELONE ASXS JUDGMENT
FOR A SMALL FOB.TTTNE
Files Cross-Complaint to the Suit In-
stituted Against Him by ex-
Judge "Wallace.
Drury Melone has filed answer to the
complaint of William T. Wallace and Ry
land B. Wallace, by which the plaintiffs
seek to recover from the defendant the
sum of SS1S3 33. alleged to be due for legal
services rendered as counsel for Drury
Melone as assignee of Jackson R. Myers
and George W. Harwood. in an action in
stituted by them against the city of Plac
erville to recover on bonds issued by that
municipality.
The plaintiffs allege that Melone agreed
to pay them one-half the sum collected
for services in the case, but failed to keep
his agreement.
Melone. after entering a general denial
to the allegations of the plaintiffs, makes
cross-complaint against them, and con
cludes the same with a demand for judg
ment against the plaintiffs for $65,725 40.
This sum. Melone alleges, is due him for
services rendered on behalf of the plain
tiffs. For examining salt lands in San
Mateo County Melone asks $600; for sell
ing 1130 shares of Pacific stock in 1SS7 for
$169,500 he asks $5000: for purchasing a
Valencia street let. $500; for placing $100,0')0
of Judge Wallace's money on a loan to
the Spring Valley Water Company he
asks $1000; for one-half the purchase price
of a portion of the old Woodward's Gar
dens. $32,132 15. Various other services al
leged to have been performed by Melone
bring his claim against the plaintiffs up
to the figure stated.
Take note of the delightful days we are
now enjoying and then fancy what a su
premely delightful experience the excur
sionists to Santa Cruz will have to-mor
row. Neither cold nor oppressively warm,
the conditions are absolutely perfect, and
the season on the beach and elsewhere in
that interesting little city was never more
Inviting. Santa Cruz is prepared to give
a hearty welcome to all, and Santa Cruz
does nothing by halves.
The suggestion is again offered to all
who intend going that it will save a great
deal of annoyance to secure tickets be
fore Sunday morning, which can be done
at 613 Market street, the Southern Pa
cific's city ticket ottlce, to-day and to
morrow. Two dollars for the round trip,
and about five or six hours at the beach.
This means a day's outing among the
most attractive scenes in all the West
at a cost of but little more than a cent
a mile for traveling. The world Is surely
better for privileges and experiences of.
this kind.
Wm. H. Menton will be in command, as
usual, and can be seen at his office at
noontime by any who may wish to make
inquiries. The time of departure is 7:43
a. m. from the ferry depot, foot of Mar
ket street.
Santa Cruz Will Present a
Brilliant Scene.

THE GREAT DAY
under Instructions from Captain Seymour.
Tobin a few minutes later came into court
and said that he knew nothii.g about the
cases, as they were in the hands of the
detectives.
Attorney Mack, for the defendants,
moved for a dismissal, as there was no
one to prosecute the cases. The dc-fend
ants had also been booked for vagrancy,
but no one had sworn to the complaints
on that charge, and there should be no
hesitation on the Judge's part In dis
missing it.
"I cannot understand the action of the
police." said the Judge, "but I do not care
to accept the responsibility of dismissing
the cases. I will continue them till Mon
day and will fix small bail so that the de
fendants need not be detained in prison
any longer. Perhaps by that time the
police will have made up their minds what
to do in the matter."
The clash between the detective depart
ment and Captain Wittman may form the
subject of an inquiry before, the Police
Commissioners. Th<? facts have been laid
before Chief Sullivan and he has issued
an order meantime that In future when a
policeman makes an arrest assisted by
detectives or assists detectives in mak
ing an arrest the pdlceman must always
get credit for his share of the work.
Complication? have arisen in the cases ,

yesterday when the cases were called
another complication arose. The arrests
Y. . re made bv Sergeant Tobin and Police
rr...n Ellver, assisted by Detectives Dillon
and Ryan. In reporting the case one of
I i,(- morning papers neglected to mention
Toblu'a r.ame a.:id he complained to Cap
tain Wittman that the detectives were
t;tkir.g all th* credit to themselves. Witt
man Instructed him to let the detectives
?;.kr- rharg^ of the case, seeing they want
â¢ â¢'! :;:! the credit. Consequently no officer
itm in court yesterday when the cases
vrere called and the Judge was surprised.
Finally Detective Ryan was found, and
he told the Judge that Sergeant Tobin
w;i< <--;pr>osed to lonk after the cases, a-s
hÂ« fcr.d Dillon simply assisted Tobin and
pot Cheney to swear to the complaints

SQUABBLING OVER RIGHTS
Japanese students and those learned In
Oriental lore have all lent a hand, with
the result of making the exhibition a
beautiful harmony of color, a most Inter
esting historical study, and a valuable ob
ject lesson to the student of religions.
Here are to be found the Shinto sym
bols, thp simple, austere, spiritual relig
ion of the ancients of Japan, with ltR
eight-pointed magic mirror, its brass bells
with which to ring up- the- absent gods,
its seven household deities, its dancing
goddess, shriners. and rich scarlet and
gold or tender gray embroideries.
Here. too. may be seen the lavish Imag
inations of the Buddhists, with their
strange grotesqueries of hundred-handed
goddesses and the like. Ancient temple
bells, long silent, are here, and mild, In
scrutable Buddhas, the sacred lotus and
the rosaries with which the votaries tell
over their prayers. Photographs of cele
brated temples and shrines are in evi
dence, and all with ample description,
with its authority, close by.
A couple of hours could not be more in
terestingly spent than among these sym
bols from an ancient land. "At the sign
of the lanterns," 130S California street,
the exhibition Is held. Twenty-five cents
Is the admission, and there will be open
house all to-day and evening and to-mor
row afternoon.
THE Southern Pacific's workmen
have finished grading the "Gap."
between Burf and Ellwood. on the
company's coast division, and all
that now remains to complete the
tin* is th>- construction of three viaducts
and th* I.nyins: of a few miles of track.

''::â¢? Engineer Hood has recently re-
I fmni the scene of operations and
a is highly pl?,if=e-3 xvith the progress that
- i"ir;c made. Mr. Hood has put a great
deal of time and hard work into the build-
ing of this road and Its success will be due
very largely to his efforts. The grading
has been one of the largest items in the
tindertaking and has furnished labor to
from 1<XX> to 20"X) men at a time.
McMurtrey & Stone of this city, who
had the contract, experienced no little
trouble trying to secure help, despite the
fact that they offered as high as $2 50 a
<iay for labor. For several woeks prior to
the completion of the grading Indians
were employed and they did good work.
Only one other Instance is recalled where
Indian labor has br-en extensively em
ployed in thp construction of a big rail
road. The Burlington company has had
satisfactory experience with the red men
in th* construction of a new branch from
its short line to Montana into the Big
Horn basin.
The number of miles graded on the coast
cut off is fifty-five. Next to the grading the
most difficult part of the road's construc
tion is the building of viaducts. Five out
of the nine have already been completed.
The sixth is now in course of construction.
Slow progress is made because of the
great amount of riveting that must be
done. The viaduct at Jalama is 450 feet
long and 100 feet high from th<> bed of the
creek to the top of the ties. The gap now
remaining to be finished is between Ga
vesta Pass and Point Conception.
The opening of the new line will mean a
nhorter and more direct route from this
city to I-os Angeles. The heaviest grade
fnr south hound trains Is reached four
miles between Santa Margarita and Cu
esta, where there is a rise of only 294 feet
in four miles, while on the present line
over the Tehachapl Pass it rises to an
elevation of 3033 feet.

FORT WORTH. Tex.. Sept. 29.â The
Trinity River continued to rise all day
and Is fully thirty-five feet high at this
point. The overflow reaches out more
than a mile, resembling a large lake, an&
is from three to six feet deep.
Much of the Cotton Belt Railroad track
has been carried away. The Cotton Belt
station i3 surrounded with water three or
four feet deep, and all business is sus
pended temporarily, as trains cannot get
Into the yards, or even within a mile of
them. The waters have Interfered with
the running of trains and street cars in
the city. Service on the north side street
car lines has been abandoned.
It has been many years since the waters
of the Trinity have reached such a high
stage.
As yet no loss of life has been reported,
but it is feared that possibly some people
have perished below this city in the Trin
ity River bottoms by the unprecedented
overflow.
The people below here were not notified
of the preat rise, as they were at this
point. The damage to farms along the
river will he very great, and possibly the
loss will reach $100,000.
Last night the water around the water
works station was three feet deep. If the
flood continues to rise damage to the
water works cannot be averted.
The family of Superintendent Samuel
Evans was saved from the swollen stream
by friends who went to them in a row
boat.
GALVESTON. Sept. 28.â To-day 2200 men

NEW COMMUNITIES
Prediction cf Dr. Ogborne.
"There is no question in my mind but
that whole communities who now suf-
fer from the bad effects of coffee would
be revolutionized if they knew of the ac-
tual facts regarding the use of coffee and
the help lhat could be obtained from
the use of Postum Cereal Food Coffee.
fa my own case coffee produced dizzi-
ness, heart palpitation and sallowness of
romplexion. When I abandoned the o:-
dinary coffee and took up Postum tNc
difficulties were removed." Rev. W. X.
Oprbnrne, Hammonton. N.J.
Some people, when trvinjr to break
off the coffee habit, feel the lack of
stimulant so much that thev mix half
roffec ar.d half Postum. then gradually
reduce the amount of coffee until they
jrink Postum alone.
Most people can break off from coffee
U once if they can have the* Poftum
Food Coffee, for the taste of the two is
Â¦ n much alike that myiv times^ the
:hsnj;e is not noticed. The user inva-
riably improves in health, and in a
month's time shows marked change
'or the better.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
Mr. J. B. Potter, Centerville, R. I., writes Sept. 15:
"Fifteen years ago I had to give up business on account of poor health. 1 was
suffering from a number of old chronic diseases and had complete nervous pros-
tration. In 1891 r commenced taking Paine's Celery Compound and soon found
that 1 was getting the better of my complaints. 1 continued using it until I
was restored to good health. Believing that an ounce of prevention is worth a
pound of cure, I take the Compound in the spring and fall, and it keeps me
well. Paine's Celery Compound has made almost a new man of me, and I have
gained twenty-eight pounds of good, solid flesh and blood, thanks to its use."
"It cured me of old chronic diseases
and nervous prostration."

Weekly Review of Trade will say to-morrow:
Not Wall street alone but the entire business
world as well watched the progresa^of efforts
to bring about a settlement of the anthracite
coal strike with active Interest. This week the
paralysis of the anthracite Industry was more
complete than last, and the effect was seen
upon the distribution of merchandise in the
East and the placing of new orders with the
manufacturers. Coal advanced 25c above last
week and many of the large companies refused
to name a selling price. The strike Involved
about 15,000 more miners and hundreds of train
men, but the working force has Increased large
ly through the settlement between the Amal
gamated Association and several steel com
panies whose works, employing 60,000 men,
have been idle, while only 1600 men were af-
J fected by the shut-down of the Susquehanna
Iron and Steel Company by the strike. In the
I East the conditions seem generally favorable
for a quick recovery with the coal strike over
while in the West there has been no noteworthy
reduction In the distribution of any class oC
goods. Weather conditions have been favorable
for late crops and farm work Is progressing
rapidly, except for some damage to grain la
the shock in the Northwest.
Aside from the expected reduction to $26 for
steel rails and a sale of Bessemer pig at Pltta
burg at $13 75, the whole list ol Iron and steel
products is unchanged. The feeling grows
stronger that the bottom has been reached
Taking the eleven articles quoted in our prlc>
tables It will be seen that after an advance
of o\er 100 per cent In 1899 prices have de
clined only about 35 per cent this year and
there is already a tendency toward a higher
level. One company in considering; the pui
chase of 10,000 tons of foundry iron and an
export order for 6500 tons of rails has been
placed. More coke ovens are In operation, but
the price Is unchanged.
Wheat again rose to 83c, but failed to maln
. tain the advance. Corn for prompt delivery
was scarce and advanced 10c above the price
at this date last year, or over 12 per cent
This naturally disposed of foreign buyers and
exports for the week were only 1.5G0.0C8 bushels
whilp for four weeks 8,476,546 bushels went out
at Atlantic ports, against 12,155,904 bushels a
year ago. Wheat shipments from the Eastern
coast were 2,783.713 bushels (flour Included)
against 3,929.138 bushels last year. In the
cereals, as with cotton, outsiders do not nur
chase freely at the current level of prices
Another increase of 5790 cases in shipments
of boots and shoes from Boston makes the
outlook more encouraging for that industry
and manufacturers are rejoicing over a wldelv
distributed ranee of orders, which indicated
that stocks of all grades have reached a low
point. Needs are imperative In many sections
Jobbers of this city are busy and Western
buyers ask prompt shipment. After a lonJ
period of stagnation the present moderate volt
ume of trade is most welcome. Leather 1*
sharing {he improvement, but the situation as
to hides is rather depressing because of heavv
curre . I ?. t , rece| P ts Â°t <*"le and the probability
of still larger arrivals. "*

afterward weakened. The elevators bought
September. There was a good shipping demand,
but freights wore scarce. The weather was
unfavorable for the movement of Wheat in the

From July 1 to date, this season, wheat ex
ports are 42,762,500 bushels, against 50,516,015
Wheat, including: flour, shipments for the
week aggregated 4,212.810 bushels, against 3,535.
837 last week and 3,872,455 in the corresponding
week of 1899.
Spot cotton is up on the week, but the gen
eral market has fluctuated nervously, influenced
on the one hand by heavy receipts and on the
other by apparent famine conditions. A satis
factory activity in distributed trade, checked
t} some extent In certain localities by unseason
able weather and in others by a tendency to
curtail operations pending the outcome of the
Presidential contest, is disclosed by tele-graphic
advices.
But little of significance is to be extracted
from the movement of prices. Wheat has been
somewhat irregular and prices shift listlessly
being about where they were at this time last
tveek. Absence of foreign demand, owing: prob
ably to larger Russian shipments, coupled with
higher freights, tended to the unsettlemenc.
NEW TORK. Sept. 2S.-Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say: The month of September closes
with a rather better outlook In the Industrial
world than was apparent a week or ten days
ago. The reports as to the -probability of a
settlement of the anthracite coal strike which
have been current for a couple of days seem
to have a basis of fact and there Is more than
a likelihood that the most disturbing feature
in the industrial situation for some time is in
process of elimination. The settlement of the
amalgamated wage scale in the West has al
ready resulted In the starting of some Im
portant mills. An encouraging feature In tho
iron and steel situation Is the number and
character of foreign inquiries. Thus far little
response in the way of orders has been elicited
by the reduction in the price of steel rails
though It is perhaps a little early to speak
with definiteness as to the effect of the reduc
tion. Prices of Southern pig have been shaded
Bomewhat at St. Louis and at Pittsburg there
have been moderate sales of Bessemer piglron
at the decline. The demand for structural ma
terial continues steady and prices are firm. The
fact that the tin plate scale remains unsettled
pirxlucf-s but little effect.
Xczc York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, SÂ»pt. 2*.â Stocks were reaction
ary to-day on the substantial s=atisfac
tion of the urgent demand from the *hort ia
tereM. The brokers were too busy on the floor
ltst night in the closing hour to notice what
was going on in the loan crowd, but the fact
was disclosed thie morning that the supply of
ftocks v.aa again very abundant, ae a result
Of the heavy reduction in the outstanding
short Interest and the consequent borrowing
demand for stocks. This in itself was suf
ficient to indicate a reaction, a* the existence
of a larpÂ«* short interest is a potential sup
poit to rrlr-e? and Its eliniination materially
weakens the technical porttton of the market.
In addition there was the usual lark of ex-
Ijli^it official information regarding yesterday's
rumored strike settlement and some natural
reaction in sentiment as a consequence. But
the underlying conviction remains unshaken
that a sott lenient Is in course of arranfr^mer.t.
There were strong e;>ots among the coslers.
Heading first preferred advancing at the cpen
inp on it? good showing of August net earnings
end Laikav.anna rising an extreme 3\ points
on the d<x-laratinn of the regular quarterly
dlvMen-J. This served as something of a drag
on the downward course of the market. Grow
ing weakness developed among some of the
fpecia:t->s and heavy liquidation was in evi
dence In Northern Pacific, the stock declining
t^.. The liquidation was attributed to
IV-rlin account. The Berlin stock market con
tinued in a highly unsettled condition, owing
to the growing stringency of money. De
c'.frrs for mar.y of the prominent stocks
ranged f n , m j to 2 points from the lowest and
the den-.an<l to cover shorts at the decline waÂ«
sliRhl. The market closed dull and heavy.
The prfKpeots of an unfavorable bank state
ment was a notably depressing factor.
Sterling exchange steadied In New York to
day, but cxrhar.se on Berlin and Paris fell
sharply.
Liquidation in the stock market has not been
es lcrgr a? last Â».<"fk, but a small decrease
In loans in expected to-morrow. The inroad
upon surplus reserve- will, nevertheless, be of
formidable proportion*. The Assistant Treas

I CHICAGO. Sept. 28.â Wheat started dull and
I weak and kept at that gait ali day. The chief
I bearish factor was the Uroomhall estimate that
; the Argentine would have an exportable sur
j Plus of 92.000.000 bushels. On the other hand
, Northwest receipts were light, Argentine shlp
1 Slfl"Â» , 1/ MÂ°' 000 b " shels - compared with 624.-
OwO bushels the week previous, and New York
reported seventy loads taken for export The
crowd was in the selling mood, however, and

EASTERN MARKETS.
Chicago Grain Market.
NEW TORK. Sept. 23.â Bradstreet's Finan
cial Review to-morrow will say: In the early
part of this week, the market was inclined tu
break under the influence of the anthracite
coal miners' strike. Declines were scored
throughout t*ie general share list, accompanied
by liquidatloi. and a good deal of short sell
ing en the part of traders. The only buying
support that could bÂ« seen was in fact afforded
by the disposition of the proferslonal buyers
to cover their contracts at moderate declines.
On Thursday there was a sharp rally in prices,
due mainly to covering on a shorter extension
scale than at any time since the reaction be
gan. It was caused by the reports that a set
tlement of the coal strike was In immediate
prospect and that the political outlook, about
which Wall street was becoming more and
more apprehensive, had also improved. While
the bears themselves furnish the principal bu>
ing power it was noted that inside suppoit
once more appeared In certain stocks and some
scattered fresh buying was also noted. On
Friday, however, the short covering slackened
and reports that the settlement of the strike
had met with obstacles resulted in a renewed
declining tendency. The public still keeps out
of the market and Is considered likely to do
so until the election Is out of the way. Lon
don has taken little part in our market, though
some little buying by the -foreign element oc
curred, and they were also credited with sell
ing Northern Pacific. The money situation
was next to the strike and politics the prin
cipal influence in the market. The heavy
movements of funds to the South and West,
with the reduction of the bank reserves at
New York necessitates a curtailment of the
volume of funds offered on time in the Wail
street market and a marking up of rates to
5 per cent for arrangements ranging beyond
the election. A good deal of conservatism is
phown in banking circles, but lt is noticed
there is little or no disposition to permit any
undue apprehension to assert itself regarding
the relations of the money market to the po
litical situation. None of the symptoms of
acute alarm which prevailed four years ago
In the money and stock markets can be seen
as the present Presidential election approaches
and the tightening of money would appear to
be mainly the result of the heavy movement
of funds to the interior.

MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF
ALBERTA MACDONALD
Young Woman Supposed to Havs
Committed Suicide by Tr.king
Carbolic Acid.
* OAKLAND. Sept. 2S.â Alberta MacDon-
aid, IS years old, the daughter of Mr. and
Mr=. Charles R. MacDonuid. cied to-night
at her residence on Chicago avenue, near
Watson avenue. East Oakland, under cir
cumstances which point very strongly to
suicide from carbolic acid poisoning. Upon
thÂ«Â» report of the physicians who were
called to attend the young woman Coro
ner Mehrmann took charge of the case
und will ho!<! investigation. An autopsy
will be required to determine the. exact
cauÂ«c of death, aitbougrb there was exter
nal evidence that the girl had taken a
verv large dose of carbolic acid. For
nearly a year she h;id neen suffering from
a QerVOUS complaint, which had a ten
dency to make her ot a melancholy dis
position. She had bepn compelled because
of overstudy to retire from the high
school about eight months ago, and since
then had been much under a phys : clan"s
care.
Mim= MacDcr.ald had complained yester
day to her mother that she felt a recur
rence cf the symptoms of a year ago,
when Fhe had been seriously affected. It
is supposed this sense of returning illness
had preyed upon her rnind. although the
friends and relatives at the house this
evening declare that she hud shown no
sigrs cf mental disturbance. About 6
o'clock to-night Miss MacDorald said she
felt tired r.nd bade good-night to a num
ber of .Iriends. She went to her room and
retii^-d. Fifteen minutes later Mrs. Mac-
Donald stepped tc '..er daughter's bedside,
as was her custom, to see. if everything
was all ri?ht. Th*- mother detected the
heavy breathing of the girl, and believing
something was wrong summoned assist
ance. Those who came detected a strong
odor of carbolic acid. Oil, white of an ege
and vinegar were used while Dr. J. M.
Shannon ind Dr. C. M. Selfridge were
summoned. Although they arrived in U-n
minutes, the jriri was dying and the end
came very quickly.
"In kss than half an hour after she had
retired Miss MacDonald was dead," said
Dr. Shannon. "The evidence all points
to suicide, but whether by carbolic, acid
1 am not prepared to say until the autopsy
ha-Â» been held. The young woman was de
spondent and suffering from melanehr.Ha.
due to her physical condition. I did not
observe any odor from the poison, hut
those who preceded me said the odor was
so strong that It was easily detected."
Despite the appraranri's th<* family are
loth to belfcve that the girl committed
suicide. Thu father is connected wÂ«th the

Two Canals Binding Atlantic.
It Is asserted that the future will see two'
canals binding the Atlantic to the Pacific ocean.
The value of such connection cannot be too
highly estimated. It will bring added prosperity
to the nation, as surely as Hostetter"s Stomach
Bitters brings to the dyspeptic. If you
cannot get rid of your indigestion, constipation,
dyspepsia or biliousness try the Bitters, and
never accept anything In place of it if you wlah
to c<Â»t well.

Â¦Friend, who underwent a severe surgical
operation at the Receiving Hospital yes
terday for injuries received the day be
fore by being struck by the local train,
has rallied completely from the shock and
the surgeons are almost certain of her
recovery. The use of cocaine, adminis
tered hypodermically to deaden the nerves

tho weakened condition of the patient
chloroform or ether would probably have
caused her death.

It is every candidate for himself in the

much of the local tight as it can control.

"The history' of the country has been
one of expansion from the original thir

growth has taken place in many cases
during Democratic administration. Ex

HOTEL ARRIVALS.
The Supreme Court yesterday reversed
the decision rendered by the lower court
in the case of James "Waters and wife,
plaintiffs and respondents, vs. D. C. Poole,
defendant and appellant.
The action was brought In Yolo County
to aulet title to a iT7-a.cre tract ot land
located near the Sacramento River. On
the trial the defendant objected to the
taking of any testimony because it ap
peared from the complaint that the land
in controversy was situated in Sutter
County. The objection was overruled by
the trial Judge and Pool appealed.
It was shown by the evidence that In
1?38 the Sacramento River was by the pre
vious acts of the Legislature the boundary
between Yolo and Sutter counties and tha
land in controversy was at that time un
questionably in Yolo County, it being on
the Yolo side of the river. It was situated,
however. In a bay or peninsula bordering
on and nearly surrounded by the river.
In that year some beaver trappers made
a small cut or canal across the neck of
this peninsula on the Yolo side of the land
In question and the waters running there
in in a year or two washed such a channel
that the river steamboats passed through
that way and since 1S62 it has received the
main volume of the river water and, ex
cept In times of hiph water, there Is no
current In the abandoned river bed.
The court holds that the objection made
went to the jurisdiction of the 'court and
should have been sustained and the case
dismissed. The lower court should have
taken cognizance thai the land lay In
Sutter County.
TEAPPEBS CHANGED THE
COURSE OF THE RIVER
Twenty-Seven Acres Added to An

Government Seeks to Show That
the Fortune Was Not
Gained by Honest
Means.
NEW YORK, Sept. 28.â Robert West
cott, father-in-law of Captain O. M. Car
ter, continued his testimony before Com
missioner Shields to-day in the hearing
of an application for the removal of
J. F., W; E. and T. A. Gaynor and B. J.
Greene to the jurisdiction of the Georgia
Federal courts.
In detailing the story of a number of
stock transactions in which he was en
gaged in 1891 and 1892 Mr. Westcott said
he introduced Captain Carter to his stock
brokers, Reid & Flagg. some time in 1893.
At that time and in 1&95 Captain .Carter
held his power of attorney.
He oald he might have had the railroad
bonds to the value of $100,000 in 1S93 when
he went to Kurope, but that the greater
part of his property waa real estate.
A clause in the power of attorney Cap
tain Carter held in 1S35 gave him authority
to buy, sell and deal in all stocks and
bonds owned by Mr. "Westcott or his wife.
At that time Mr. Westcott said he owned
no stock or bonds and the clause was
merely a part of the formal document.
Mr. Westcott admitted he had received
money from John F. Gaynor and from
Benjamin D. Greene at different times, lie
could not remember the exact amount*.
He received $10,000 from each of them in
1893 and 1S94 and Jn September of 1S94, at
the "Waldorf-Astoria, Carter gave him
$100,000 in bills. He could not remember
what he did with the money, but pre
sumed he put if in his safe deposit vault
or deposited it to his account in the bank.
In the hearing in July last it was shown
that the Atlantic Construction Company
received $4til,075 September 11, 1S94, from
the Government on a contract and that on
the same day there was deposited in the
name of R. F. "Westcott with Reid <&
Flagg,', brokers, $53,022, and in the name
of R. F. Westcott, with the Union Trust
Company. $50,000. The prosecution then
claimed that the amount represented Cap
tain Carter's commission.
Mr. Westcott said he handed the money
he received from Gaynor and Greene to
Carter and Mr. Kellogg produced a dozen
or more bank deposit slips to show by
their dates and amounts that the moneys
were deposited in banks and with brokers
to the credit of R. P. Westcott. The dif
ferent amounts aggregate more than $250,
000 and ranged individually from. $500 to
$53,000.
The cross-examination of Mr. Westcott
was not concluded at 1 o'clock, at which
hour Commissioner Shields ordered an ad
journment until Monday.

The Board of Works submitted an or
<?:nance to the Supervisors yesterday pro

is to be removed from a public street
when the renewal is to be at the city's
expense; also providing that when owners
of property at their own expense repave
I a public street the old material displaced
j in such repaving shall be subject to dis
posal by such owners.
This resolution, if adopted, will be In
direct violation of the charter, which says
that such material is the property of the
city and must be removed to the cor
poration yard. The City Attorney has also
rendered an opinion that the Board of
Works has no power to give such material
to a property owner, even though better
material should be substituted.
The proposed ordinance is in two sec
tions, the first providing that if the old
material in the judgment of the City En
i gineer cannot be stored or economically
â¢ used the Board of Works is authorized to
cause the same to be sold at public auc
tion and the proceeds paid to the City
Treasurer and placed in the general fund.
I The second section exempts all cases
I where the owners of property at their own
expense shall repave the street, and pro
vides that the old material displaced shall
be subject to the disposal of such owners.
The section continues:
In case of the proposed removal of old curb&
for th* purpose of substituting new granite
curbs or coping the tali board may ftrant per
mission for the substitution and disposal by the
owner of such curbir.

Dr. Beverly Cole, however. Is an office

while his motives are not Impugned a re
flection Is cast on the administration of

oner. The Insinuation Is spread out that .
the office is in collusion with McNab and
Sims to hog the estates of the dead. If
proof can be adduced â¢ to establish the
truth of the statement touching such col
luslon It will go far to disrupt the Dem

are brilliant members, but It will not nec

The fight now on In the Democratic par
ty of this town surely presents many pic
turesque and fantastic features. At first
glance the superficial beholder may get
the impression that the contest Is un
equal, as Hearst has three papers and
Dr. Cole only one morgue, but perceptive
students will observe that the Morgue Is
modern and up to date, hence to the dis
cerning mind the aspect of Inequality is
removed.
Onlookers who are expecting a fight at
close quarters will be disappointed

It Is all right, perhaps, in a fashion by
mild Insinuation for a Democratic news
paper to convey the Impression that Gavin
McNab and State Senator J. C. Sims,
leaders of the Democratic organization
for purity and reform, are loiterine
around the Morgue to snatch away an
estate from the Public Administrator. In
terpreted according to boss notions of
good local government this means that
Sims and McNab are trespassing upon
the preserves of Boland, the Public Ad
ministrator.
Then came the threats of a personal
visitation from Hearst. Democrats who
are taking an Interest In the party quar>
rel incline to the opinion that the talk of
Hearst coming in person Is a bold bluff.
They say that he will not come to Cali
fornia until Dr. R. Beverly Cole, the
Â¦worthy Coroner, leaves the State. It Is
true that San Francisco is a large and
expanding town, but It Is not sufficiently
larpe or expansive for the Jbint presence
of the Coroner and Hearst.

the loveliness of the Bermuda lily, and

Fruit costumes made up in originality
what they lacked in numbers, and most
beautiful of them all was Mrs. E. D. Rey

Mrs. W. Frank wore an exquisite pansy
gown of embroidered yellow mull, over
yellow satin with bunches of velvet pan
sles scattered over it in artistic desipn.
Miss Therese MorKap attempted the dif
ficult task of representing a hyacinth and
succeeded in showing the flower in all
Its colors. The texture of her gown was
Iipht as Rossamer and shaded from deep
pink to lavender.
Miss Alice Schussler was the modest
Miss Mary Scott was there as a narcis
sus. The foundation of her gown was
white satin completely covered with
white tulle. Narcissus stalks were ar
ranged apron fashion on the skirt, the
flowers drooping from them in a lifelike
manner. The corsage was also trimmed
in narcissus blossoms and stalks.
Queen rose in the rosebud garden of
girls was Miss Edna Hopkins. There
were twelve white roses flitting among
the flowers, but Miss Hopkins easily
queened it over them all. Her short skirt
was completely covered with white silk
rose petals, and pendent in each one was
ftn imitation dewdrop. The bodice was
fashioned to represent the rose petals,
springing from a calyx of green.
Mi.=s Carolan's gown faithfully followed
the delicate beauty of the wild rose. Miss
Genevieve Carolan was very dainty in a
white gown garlanded with apple blos
soms.

to the carriage-house and illuminated by
a column of lights stationed on a plat

originality was exercised in the fashion

Carolan last evening et their Eurl'.r.game
villa. "Crossways."
Although the gathering was to celebrate
the openinpr of the new Carolan stables
the function was really held In the- barn.
For a week past an anr.y of electricians
and florists had been engaged on the placG
and the result was a glittering palace of
light and floral beauty. "Crossways" em
braces 10) acres of rolling land, in the
midst of which stands the mansion. The
entire estate had been converted by the
landscape gardener into a forest of shrubs,
lawn and flowers. Every avenue was
strung with Japanese lanterns. No less
than five thousand cf these decorations
were used, while on the exterior and in
terior of the barn 3000 incandescent..elec
tric lamps cast their brilliancy every
where. The combined capacity of the
electric light plants of San Mateo. Red
wood City and Palo Alto was taxed to
their utmost capacity to furnish the cur
rent necessary for the illumination, a di
rect wire running from each power sta
tion.
The stable is built in the form of a
quadrangle, with a courtyard of about
one acre in exte-nt. and for t!ie dance last
evening the latter wns covered with can
vas. In the center of the court was
erected for the occasion an electric foun
tain which throughout the evening dis
ported its vari-colored streams for the
edification of the Kuests. On the westerly
#>nd of the court is the carriage-house,
painted a pure white with trimmings of
pold, while red. white and blue electric
ligjits without number Â¦were strung about
the room.
As the cotillon progressed these lights
were ever changing, and as the guests in
their brilliant costumes representing all
manner of fruits and flowers passed to
and fro they formed a strikingly pictur
esque and beautiful picture.
The outline of the exterior of the entire
group of structures was marked by count
less numbers of electric globes, which
thining against a black background of the
eky. produced a dazzling effect.
A special train of Pullman coaches ar
rived at Burlingame shortly after i?
o'clock and the guests found that the
depot platform had been canvas covered
for their benefit. Between the depot and
"Crossways," a distance of two miles, arc
lights had been placed at frequent Inter
vals.
At midnight supper was served at tete
a-tete tables, placed <â¢:Â» the verandas
which encircle the courtyard, and during
the supper th*Â» guests were entertained
alternately by the band of fifty pieces and
by the fancy dancing of a corps of
artists.
The dancers, gowned to represent the
poppy, the marguerite, the lily and the
rose, went through a series of attractive
evolutions, after which, attired In the pic

Deuprey closed "the argument for the
people. Judge Burnett charged the jury
and it retired to deliberate upon a verdict.
Assistant District Attorney Deuprey
opened the argument for the prosecution.
Attorney Lennon of the firm of Lennon &
Hawkins, representing the defendant, fol
lowed. .. Mr. Lennon pointed out to the
jury the fact that under an indictment for
obtaining money by false pretenses a con
viction could not be had unless the allega
tions of the indictment were proved in
toto by two witnesses or by one whose
testimony was corroborated throughout
by secondary evidence. Radomsky, he
caid. was the only witness under this rule
and his testimony was not supported. Mr.
lennon also pointed out to the jury that
tho order dated October 14 called for pay
ment for twenty days' labor. Bier &
Resrensberger both admitted that when
they purchased the order they knew it to
be an Impossibility for a person to have
worked twenty days in October when only
fourteen days were evidenced by the or
der. This, Mr. Lennon said, was conclu
sive that the brokers were not the vic
tims of false pretenses, but bought the
order with their eyes open.
"I signed these orders in blank." said
McGlade, "that the clerks might fill them
out. I sijrned many of them at a time. I
did not fill out the orders, as is charged."
McGlade was placed on the stand in his
own defense. He admitted that the sig
natures on the orders of September 16 and
October 14. on which Bier & Regensber
ger advanced money to J. R. Radomsky,
were his. He denied, however, that he
filled out the forms.
H. II. Colby and former Chief of Police
Lees were called by the prosecution when
the case opened yesterday morning. They
testified as to MeGlade's arrest anil then
the prosecution closed.
Charges of forgery yet stand against
McGlade. Whether or not he will be
placed on trial again, however, is a mat
ter for speculation among those interested
in the case.
It was -said that the jury .held the opin
ion that the brokers who advanced money
on the orders on which McGhiuVs prose
cution was based were not the victims of
false pretenses, and that when they ac
cepted an order calling for pay for twenty
days' labor in one month, when the order
was dated on the 14th of that month and
could not possibly legally call for pay tor
more than fourteen days, they did so at
their own risk and with full knowledge of
the risk involved in their purchase.
After the verdict had been announced
McGlade shook his counsel warmly by the
hand, bowed his thanks to the Jurors as
they filed out of the box and then turned
to accept the congratulations of his
friends.
Peter W. McGlade has been adjudged
"not guilty" of the charge of obtaining
money under false pretenses charge!
against him hy the people. Yesterday aft
ernoon at 4:30 the jury retired to deliber
ate on a verdict. An hour and a half latei
the bell announced that a verdict had been
reached. It was one of acquittal.
