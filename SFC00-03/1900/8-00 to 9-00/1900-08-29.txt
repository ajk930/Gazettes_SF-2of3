T T T ASHINGTON, Aug. 28.â Several â¢ communications came
A AY to. Washington from tho United States officials in
y y China" to-day, but being undated In most- cases the
Â¦* Government was by no means, satisfied with the state
cÂ£ communications, and the Cabinet meeting gave the larger
part of its attention to the problem of rectifying this state of
affairs. Evidences of interference with ; the messages have
accumulated .to a point where the Government has determined
tc take steps to establish cables of its own, even if it is neces
sary to employ tho rather expensive device of a man-of-war
plying between Shanghai' and Chefu-, for' this purpose. Mean
while word comes "that rapid progress is making with the shore
cable which is to connect these points, and it is believed that
within a week these means of communication will be open. _
Two - messages were received from General Chaff ee | to-day,
and while they cast n6 light on the general situation: they, were
inferentially important. The ( general'B statement that he needs

PRESENT BATTLE IN CHINA IS
DECLARED ONE OF DIPLOMACY
LONDON. Aug. 29. 3:40 a. m.â That
the inexplicable delay in forward
ing telegrams from the Chinese
capital still continues Is illustrated
by the fact that the latest dispatch
from Peking, the telegram of the special
correspondent of the Associated Press,
describing the search ior Boxers in thÂ«
imperial rark. Is dated no later than
AuguFt "1. There is np confirmation from
any source of the report of an advance

Nor is there any furt'nor news of the al
leg-ed detention of LI Hung Chang by the
admirals. Probabilities increase that all
the members of the imperial household
have pot safely to the interior.
Another dispatch, dntf^i Peking, Auguf t
15. and p**nt by pnÂ«t to .Shanrnal, describes
scpne? of appalling df^<-iation arid wamon
destruction on Lefrarion Ftreet. All the
Jioures of foreigner* wore riddled with
shells, burned or Mown up. An attempt
â¢was made to mine the American lfgratinn.
A shaft was sunk from the top of the
â¢wall fifteen feet deep and was continued
as a tunnel, with a sharp slope, in the
direction of the legation. Apparently the
Chinese did not have time to finish it.
The Eiecle's report of a defeat suffered
by the allies at Peking is everywhere dis
credited.
The Chinese legation in St. Petersburg
has received news that peace negotiations
have already begun.
The Peking correspondent of the Daily
News, in a dispatch dated August 21. as

Just what would be done in case some ol
the powers began war for the purpose of

and the administration is not disposed to
cross the bridge until it reaches it. , But
a member of the Cabinet stated to-day
that if any of the European powers en
tered upon such a programme it probably
would be reminded by the United States
that it had agreed to the "open-door" pol
icy, by which all the powers are to bo
placed upon an equal footing and that if
territory were acquired under the agree

privileges in the matter of trade, etc., as

The administration has nothing tending
to confirm the alarmist rumors regarding
the situation at Peking. Admiral Remey
reports nothing disquieting and it is as
sumed that if there was any prospect of
the allies being attacked and hemmed In
he would be in a position to hear of It
and would promptly report it to Washing

DARING DEED OF
A JAPANESE SOLDIER
YOKOHAMA, Aug. 11.â Japan is rejoic
ing over the laurels her troops are win
ning in China. Their feat of blowing up
the gates, of Tientsin was one of the most
daring on record. - The wires which were
to ignite the guncottoa refusing to work,
one of the soldiers delioerately went up to
the gates and, applying a match, was
blown into atoms as the gates came down.
A second soldier then climbed up the in
ner wall and In the dim light of the
morning opened the city to his comrades,
who swarmed in while the astonished
Chinamen threw down their guns and
fed. There are Indications that Japan is
WASHINGTON. Aug. 28.â After the
Cabinet meeting to-day it was an
nounced that the Government was
in a waiting attitude regarding
the Chinese situation. The lack oÂ£ late
advices from Peking and the failure of
the powers to show their hands as to
future policy make it necessary for th!s
Government to await developments. The
administration considers 1 it of tho great
est importance that in the negotiations
for a settlement of the Chinese dlfflculty
all the powers should act in unison and
harmoniously and its efforts are being di
rected to that end. The powers, however,
are slow to declare themselves. Several
replies nave been received to the instruc
tions sent to our Embassadors and Minis
ters Ian week, asking them to sound the
Governments to which they are accred
ited on two propositions: First, the will
ingness of these Governments to accept
the sufficiency of Li Hung Chang's cre
dentials to treat with the powers for a
settlement, and second, to ascertain if
possible what the future policy of each
power is to be. Regarding the latter in
quiry the replies thus far have developed
nothing. The powers appear to be watch
ing each other, without definite or fixed
purpose as yet of their own. With regard
to the first Inquiry Great Britain and Rus
sia are agreed that Karl Li's credentials
are sufficient. Germany, however, takes
a firm stand against the sufficiency of his
credentials and is the only power as yet
which has returned a flat-footed dissent.
The attitude of the United States is that
his credentials appear authentic. They
were promulgated by what appeared to
be a. genuine imperial edict, duly trans
mitted through the accredited Chines*
Minister, Mr. Wu, and the United States
Is willing to accept them at their face
value â at least for the present.
The administration,. from the advices it
has received,' does not credit the rumors
that Russia. Japan and Germany Intend
to declare war against China, and it; is
willing to accept all disclaimers of ulte
rior purposes on the part of the powers.
Powers Are Not Yet Agreed
Concerning Li Hunrj
Chang,
NOW AWAITING
DEVELOPMENTS
There has never been any thought on
the part of the administration officials of
criticizing Japan for her action in landing
marines at Amoy, and in fact the disem
barkation of the force has rather met
with approval. There are large American
interests in Amoy, and their appeals are
responsible in a great measure for the
dispatch of the Castine there. The pres
ence of Japanese marir.es Is expected to
bare a salutary effect upon the residents
of Amoy, but particularly upon Chinese
officials, who are expected to take meas
ures for the restoration of order and
maintenance of peace in the hope that
following the return of quiet the Japanese
will be withdrawn. No doubt Is enter
tained that Japan will withdraw her ma
rines when order is reftored and by her
action establish a precedent which may
be pofnted to for the purpose of Inducing
other nations to leave the empire.
upon the island and in addition to the
burning of the Japanese temple thero
have been riots against foreigners, the
Japanese Government has considered Jt
necessary to land a small force for the
purpose of protecting their consulate and
foreign residents at thai port."

THE steamer China, which docked
late last evening, brought another
lot of refugees from the seat of tur
moil in China. Ttaj party consisted
of Rev. J. Goforth, Mrs.^Joforth and four
children, Mrs. Simmon,* Miss Pyke, Miss
Mclntosh and Miss Dow. M.D., all from
Canada and workers in the Canadian mis
sion of the Presbyterian church. There
were also five children with the refugees.
The most interesting and communicative
person in the party was Rev. J. rGoforth,
who had a hot tlmo with Chinese bandits,
but bravely brought his family and self
safely to the coast through the most try
ing circumstances.
"We had due warning from the friendly
natives that there was trouble brewing,"
said. Mr/ Goforth. "but we did not think
the expected trouble would materialize, as
there had been many rumors that hadf
proved to be false. However, when we
received a notification from our Consul to
make for the coast as fast as possible we
lost no time in getting on the way to the
Yellow River. In fact, we left so sud
denly that I wore nothing but a pair of
Chinese overalls and a shirt, while in the
fracases that followed the shoes were
taken off my feet and I went barefooted
until I arrived among friends.
"We had no money to start with, but
after I had argued with the Chinese offl-
"The city was so disturbed we dared not
go Into the syeet. "We finally left Mr.
Holmes' house, climbing the wall sur
rounding it with the aid of a clothesrack
and a small ladder. On our way to the
nearest yamen â magistrate's house â we
met the soldiers sent to our assistance and
went back witn them to the yamen. The
mandarins, of whom there were three,
went- to the house to try to preserve our
property, but their presence had no ef
fect, as the criob continued its looting 1 ,
which had commenced on the discovery or
our absence. The mob had broken all tha
windows with stones and finally forced the
doors. The furniture was broken into bit3
and set fire to.
"When the Chinese horde had succeeded
in utterly demolishing the place they ad
vanced on the magistrate's house and
threatened to attack It unless we were
given up. Nine of the soldiers who had
defended us so faithfutly were wounded,
but they stood by us. We finally made up
our minds that if a boat could be secured
we'. would risk an attempt to reach the
coast. We so informed the mandarin, and
"The telegraph wires were cut and the
postofflces were closed, but we determined
to return to the city, where we thought
we would have greater protection. Wo
went to Mr. Holmes' house anil the man
darins issued a proclamat?"n to the peo
ple, telling them we must not be dis
turbed. No attention was paid to tho
edict;., on the contrary the notices were
defaced and covered with placards. call-
Ing on the people to kill the foreigners.
"My wife and I went with the Rev. T.
D. Holmes and family from Shanhing, in
tending to spend some . time en the hills
In the neighborhood of Klnhwa-Fu. Wo
reached the latter, place and spent eight
or nine most enjoyable days, when rumors*
reached us of the attacks on Chrl:tia,ns
by robbers. A day or so later we were re
quested by the mandarins of the district
to leave the hills.
Mr. and Mrs. C. E. Bausfield. who re
turned on the China, have a most thrill
ing story to tell of the difficulties they en
countered in making their escape from
the attacks of Chinese mobs. Mr. Baus
field is a member of the American Bap
tist Mission and has spent the past eight
years in China. He is a Chinese scholar,
speaking and writing the language fluent
ly, and has made a study of Chinese
classics. He tells the following story:
Mr. Goforth expressed the opinion that
it would not be safe for missionaries to
go into the interior of China for a year
at least. He does not think the war will
last that Ions, but says order cannot bo
restored within that period. The four
women whrÂ» were subjected to the indig
nities mentioned by Mr. Goforth refused
emphatically to make any statement re
gardinpr their experiences. Tney :-eemed
to be of the opinion that the world at
large, which is so deeply interested in the
troubles of the missionaries, had no claims
upon them, thereby showing a truly Chris
tian spirit.
know' that the mission was looted and 1
believe there were no survivors of the at
tack."
"It was truly a stormy trip and we had
hand-to-hand flgh,ts In which we were
saved i only by a miracle. The Chinese
seemed to have a special hatred for the
Catholics and our declaration that we
were Protestants was all that saved our
lives. on: an occasion when. the infuriated
Chinese had 'their drawn swords over our
heads. I fear that the Catholic mission
near us was the scene of butchery..- I
"The result was nine wounds. which I
will long treasure in memory. The wonder
to me. is that we were not all killed. On
two occasions one of the children was
lost and Mr. Griffith went astray, but we
compelled the Chinese official to produce
them. At one of the stopping places the
women of the party were assaulted rough
ly and their clothes torn from them. The
Chinese were Induced to desist by calling
upon them to show their manhood and
not ! make war on women and children.'
Our party was all Canadians, but we were
enabled to get through the country by the
generosity and bravery of Mr. Jameson,
the American engineer, who furnished the
money necessary for the Journey.
"We besought the Chinese to take bur
goods and spare our lives, but they an
swered us that not one of us was to be
spared. Then our women begged so elo
quently for the lives of the little children
that the leader of the attacking party
shouted a command to his men to spare
our lives. Then- a rush was made for our
little property and we were robbed of all
we possessed. The mules attached to our
carts were wild with fright at thesound
of the pistol shots, the shouting and gen
eral noise of the conflict. I was knocked
senseless by a fearful blow on the head
with a Chinese sword and was almost run
over by the frightened mules.
"I do not- believe that the attack by sev
eral hundred Chinese on our little party
on Sunday. July 8. was made simply with
the idea o'f robbing us of our belongings
and what money we had with us. The Chi
nese may not have been Boxers, but they
were certainly imbued with the spirit of
the Boxers, and I know that' their first
idea was to do away with us and not al
low us to get out of the country. Why,
when we were, attacked there was some
thing like 10,000 Chinese gathered from all
around, for we were near a his town, to
stand by and see us slaughtered. They
did. not move to help us. any of them,
and I believe that we would have all been
killed if it had not been for the pleading
of the women. The fiendish * Chinese
rushed upon us with swords, stones and a
few firearms. We were almost defense
less, having only three revolvers in the
party. We fired first in the air, meaning
only to frighten them, but this had very
little effect. Dr. Leslie, for example, had
fired all his cartridges except one with
out aiming at any one, when, maddened
at last by his numerous wounds, he shot
and killed a big Chinese who was just
about to strike him -on the head with his
sword.

to carry us about ten miles, leaving us to

town, which we did successfully.
SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 29, 1900.
The San Francisco CallBOSTON. Aug. 2?.â The United States
battleship Alabama to-day won the
title of "Queen of the American
Navy" In one of the most magni
ficent *peed trials In the history of
the navy. Her average speed for four
hours' continuous steaming was seventeen
knots, a figure not quite as high as that
made by the Iowa. 17.04, but notable from
the fact thai It cave an Idea of the yet
undeveloped power In this latefet product
of American shipbuilders.
The Alabama was tyiilt by the Cramps
at Philadelphia and is unlike any of the
rarlier creations both architecturally and
as a fighting machine. Ehe was built un
der a contract that required at least an
average speed of Klxteen knots per hour.
It was after 10 o'clock when the great
craft was well down the coast toward the
ttartlng line, which was five miles south
east of Thatcher Island light, near the
extremity of Cape Ann. The course then
ran about north-northeast for thirty
three nautical miles, divided into five legs.
An Interesting and picturesque feature
I was the use of sister battleships as stake
i boats, five of them being lined up â the
! Texas. Massachusetts, Indiana, Kentucky
and Kearsarge. The Alabama came down
to the starting line about 10:30 o'clock
under fair headway and went by as If on
a cruise. The first stakeboat was the
Texas. The United States ship Osceola
wa? the second mark. The third leg was
marked by the Kearsarge, and as the
j Alabama went by, now at great speed.
; Captain Folger had his jackies lined up to

tucky, thf fifth the Indiana and the out-
I mark, whfch was not far out' to sea from
J Boone Island, was the Massachusetts.

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Aug. 2S.â The
National Afro-American Council met here
to-day with an attendance of. 400 of the
representative colored men of the .United
States. Bishop Walters, president of the
organization, made his - address, which
was the feature of the day. He said that
the colored race was passing through tho
most critical period in Its history; that
great wisdom was needed to guide Its des
tinies, and that the race must stand for
its natural and constitutional rights not
in combative, revengeful spirit, but in a
manly, courageous way. He pleaded for
a full recognition of the privileges accord
ed to every white citizen of the United
States, denounced the recent disfranclse
ment amendments passed in North Caro
lina and accused the Federal Government
of neglect in not protecting the franchise
rights of the negro. He admitted that
prejudice was on the increase, but urged
that it is best to cease resistance and do
by education, industry and character
what cannot otherwise be practically ac
complished. He. urged the race to act
honorably in politics, and declared that
politicians must cease to make the negro
a pawn in the. political game.
"Some of us have signified our willing
ness to unite with the Democratic party
wherever and whenever they will make
advantages for us to do so. Since we
have taken the initiative. It Is for that
party to say whether it desires our votes
by a consideration in the way of just leg
islation and kind treatment. Until the
Southern Democracy changes Its attitude
in respect to the civil and political rights
of the negro I do not see how we can con
slstentlv help that party Into Federal
power, and I-for one will not do so."

Weather conditions were almost ideal'
for the parade. The rays of the sun
were veiled by light, fleecy clouds nearly
all day. and even when unobscured their
effect was greatly le*?ened by a cool
breeze, which blew steadily off Lake
Michigan. The line cf march, too. was
much shorter than ever before mapped
out for the Annual parade, but notwith
standing here and th^-re a veteran, ex
hatirtcd. dropped out of the ranks. Espe
cially aru this true nfter the reviewing
Ftand was passed, and many pathetic
ecenejs were witnessed down the long
s-tretch of Michigan avenue as the vet
erans fell by the v/avslde.
Probably 30.000 members of the army of
veterans took part in to-day's parade.
For exactly four hour? and twenty min
utes, most of the time with ranks almost
perfectly aligned, but occasionally falter
ing under the burden .of years, they filed
past the reviewing r-land on Michigan
avenue, saluting, as they marched by.

est parade since the day in Washington,
when the hundreds of thousands of vet*

final diffeenoment.
Veteran Drops Dead.
The one especially sad incident occur
ring to mar in a degree the glory of the
I parade was when Charles Beckwith of.,
! Algonza. Mich., dropped dead as the line
j was tiling past the corner of Michigan
avenue and Madison street. The parade
Â¦ was halted for a moment and the body of
the veteran who had responded to his last
call was tenderly removed and his com
rades passed on.
It was shortly before 10:30 a. m. when
the head of the column started from the
i corner of Michigan avenue and Randolph
street, and an hour later it was filing paÂ«:
I the reviewing stand. For hours before
| that time the sidewalks along the line of
I march were packed from curb to wall, the
I windows of the immense office buildings,
! gay with fluttering flags and bunting,
were filled with sightseers, while along
Michigan avenue, where are erected the
beautiful columns and arches forming the
court of honor, the crowd was so great
i that the hundreds of police had great dif
ficulty in keeping clear the line of march.
And all through the hours that the vet
- erans tramped by this sea of humanity
roared its- welcome. . â¢ . Â¦--

Picturesque features were supplied by
the Louisiana Veterans, who carried
pieces of sugar cane, topped with great
bunches of cotton: bv the veterans of

Shortly after passing the reviewing

Reception to Commander.
, The. evening was given up entirely to
affairs of a social character, the chief
event being an informal reception to Com
mander in ChW Shaw, department com
manders and distinguished guests at Me
morial Hall. Jt was largely attended,
thousands of old soldiers coming to greet
the high officials of their organization.
Twent5 r -six different reunions of States
were held. This feature, the holding 01
reunions by -States, had never, been at
tempted before at the national encamp
ment, and this was the first trial of the
experiment. It proved a great success.
The, ladies of the Woman's Relief Corps

evening. â¢

The sentiment in regard to the place foi
holding the next annual encampment has
apparently crystallized in favor of a far
Western -city, with Denver In the lead for
the honor so far as appearances go. There
Is apparently an almost unanimous desire
on the part of the veterans to hold-the

>
DETROIT, Aug. 23.â The military <*IvlÂ«
sion of the order of Knights of Pythias
made a splendid showing in the biennial
parade this afternoon, and the vast crowfla
that witnessed the pageant gave enthu
siastic approval all along the line oÂ£
march. Nine thousand uniformed and he!
meted Knights and musicians marched IB
rapid and orderly manner over the route
of five miles and were officially reviewed,
first by Supreme Chancellor Sample and
before dismissal by Major General Carna
han, commander of the uniform rank.
The Ohio brigade, with more than 20CO
men in line, was the leader in point ot
numbers. Indiana came rext in size, and
Pennsylvania. Illinois and Michigan were
also leaders. Very few States were whol
ly unrepresented in the line of march. One
British flag was seen In the parade, car
ried by the Canadian contingent above
their Pythian banner, and the Canadians
were not less heartily cheered than tho
American Knights.
All traffic in the downtown streets
through which the parade passed was sus
pended, street cars were stopped ana on
Woodward avenue, where the throrgÂ»
massed most thickly, ropes were stretched
along the sidewalks, leaving the broad
avenue clear. The only drawback was
lack of horses. All the headquarters ami
most of the brigade officers were well
mounted, but a considerable number c
the regimental field officers were on foot,
the local committee having failed to pro
vide horses enough. More than thirty .
bands and drum and bugle corps furnished
music for the paraders.
The parade organized at Camp Plnerr*"?.
Major General Carnahan rode at the head,
mounted on Governor Pingrees splendid
chestnut ridins horse., and followed by
his staff of forty mounted officers. In
diana had the right of the line, and her
five regiments made an imposing appear
ance. Following came the brigades ana
regiments from Illinois. Wisconsin. Vir

Minnesota. Connecticut. New Hampshire.
Rhode Island. Michigan. New Brunswick.
New York. Iowa, Pennsylvania. "West
Virginia. Massachusetts. Kentucky. Cali
fornia. Ohio. Missouri and Kansas and the
Canadian battalions. with numerous
smaller bands attached to brigades to
States other than their own.
One of the novel features was a troop
of mounted cavalry from St. Joseph, Mo.,
equipped In regulation cavalry style. An
other was the Wheeling, W. Va., battery
of artillery with guns, caissons and ac
couterments. Lodges of Pythians from
Detroit and adjacent towns brought up
the rear with several displays. Including
floats carrying scenes representing Inci
dents in Pythian lore. A delegation of 100
from Mount Clemens furnished the amus
ing feature. The men were clad In bath
robes and followed a float carrying a
huce bathtub.
Supreme Chancellor Sample reviewed
the parade from a stand erected In front
of the City Hall. \_ " T .
But one session of the Supreme Ix>djr&

WASHINGTON, Aug. 28.â The population of the city of San Francisco, ac
cording to. the official count of the returns of the twelfth census, is: 1900.
342,782; 1890,. 298,997. These figures show for the city as a whole an increase
in population of 43,785, or 14.64 per cent, from 1S90 to 1900. The population
of 18S0 was 233,939, showing an increase of 65.03S, or 27.80 per cent, from 1SS0 to 1390.
The population by Assembly districts in 1900 is as follows: Twenty-eighth.
15,731; Twenty-ninth, 15,299; Thirtieth, 15X47; Thirty-first. 15.S71; Thirty-second, 14,
037; Thirty-third, 18,758: Thirty-fourth. 21,841; Thirty-fifth, 17,647; Thirty-sixth. 27,
836; Thirty-seventh, 23,923; Thirty-eighth. 19,977; Thirty-ninth, 19,905; Fortieth. 22.472;
Forty-first. 24,233; Forty-second, 15,472; Forty-third, 23,003; Forty-fourth, 15,631; For
ty-fifth, 12,707. T:-.V . f
The cities of the .United States, so far as the Census Office has yet given out
the figures, show a very healthy and satisfactory rate of increase of population
during the last ten years. The percentage of increase ranges ,from 9.77 for Cin
cinnati to 61.S8 for Toledo. The three cities which have increased the most rapidly
are Toledo, Indianapolis and Chicago. Owing to tho changes in the boundary in
the consolidation of what is now known as Greater New York, the percentage
for that city cannot be accurately stated. For Philadelphia it is 23.57, for Bos
ton 25.67, for St. Louis 27.33, for Baltimore 17.15, for the District of Columbia
20.98, for Cleveland 46.07, for New Orleans 1S.62, for San Francisco 14.64, for
Milwaukee 39.54 and so on.
Nearly all the cities, it is stated at the Census Office, are very well satisfied
with the count, though it is probable that all of them expected a somewhat bet
ter showing than the census has given them. The complaints of an imperfect
census are declared to be few in comparison with the experience of the Census Of
fice in previous years.

TUCSON'. Ariz., Aug. 28.â The bitter
feeling of the people of Sonora, Mexico,
who have opposed the constant occupanoy
of public office by one set of men, broke
out Sunday when municipal elections were
held in that St&te. At Hermosillo the
fight was extremely bitter. Two hun
drfd men were placed in jail for vigorous
opposition to the Governor and his candi
date for President. Among them was
Jesus Santa Cruz, leader of the opposi
tion, or the Peole, as the faction la called
there. The editor of the Herald at Her
mosillo is also behind the bars, and the
only man who has escaped is Dloniclo
Ganzales, candidate for President of the
people, who made a hard fight for victory.
The result of the election Is not known
yet, but it is safe to predict that Vicente
Kscalante, father-in-law of Ramon Cor
ral, Governor of Sonora, Is elected.

Finding of the Remains of a Suicide
Near Alum Bock Causes a
Sensation at San Jose.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Aug. 2S.â Considerable ex
citement was aroused here this afternoon
by the report that the remains of James
C. Dunham, who killed the McGllncy
family at Campbell ln 189(5, had been found
on the Grant ranch, in the hills eight
miles back of Alum Rock. The skeleton
was found by Frank iiiguera.'a cowboy.
He took Chris Rolling into his confidence,
and the latter came to town and reported
the matter. Before making it public,
however. Rolling consulted Attorney- S. G
Tompkins about securing a tirm hold on
tho $10,000 reward that the citizene'of this
county promised to raise for the capture
of Dunham, dead or alive. Â» .
Rolling, his attorney and a Â¥ Deputy
Coroner made a trip to the scene, when
a thorough investigation of the remains
revealed the facj that the bones were
not those of Dunham. The case was evi
dently one of suicide, and the man had
been dead nearly a year. Beside the bodv
lay a Smith & Wessort revolver of 38
caliber. Twenty paces away was the
head, with a bullet hole in the forehead.
The .remains were dressed in a brown
suit of clothes. The man had evidently
been middle-aged. In the pockets were
found CO cents. A 10-cent piece bore the
date of 1S97, the year, after Dunham dis
appeared, and this is conclusive' proof
that the remains, were not those of the
Campbell murderer. The bones were
brought to San Jose, and the inquest will
be held to-morrow.
THOUGHT THE BONES
WERE THOSE OF DUNHAM
Thf youngsters were ln a most pitiable
condition when found, after having spent
the night roving on a lonely road with no
garment to cover their nakedness save a
linen nightgown and a pair of shoes. The
children are being cared for and the mat
ter Is to be Investigated.
They retired early with the balance of
the Inmates, but were awake. They did
not dare retain any of their daily wearing
Hpparel for fear of being caught. After all
v.as still they crept out of bed and by a
circuitous route through the building
gainev. the grounds. The children were in
their nightrobes and carried their shoes
In their hands. Barefooted, they scaled
tae schoolyard fence. At this point, they
claim, they put on their shoes. The Cas
tro girl, knowing the road, took her S
year-old companion's hand, and together
they passed through Watsonville by back
streets and struck off In the direction of
Castroville. The children's idea was to
reach home before dawn, but daylight
overtook them at Castroville. where they
were, of course, seen and detained. The
deputy sheriff, being in the neighborhood,
was apprised of the girls' condition, took
them into custody and brought them to
this city.
The Ilutchinson eirl lives with her par
ents In this city, while the Castro child
is a resident of Santa Rita, a small town
north of this city. Both the children's
parents at the beginning of the school
term sent them to the parochial school in
Watsonville. The two lassies, however,
were not domiciled long under the convent
roof. The children say that they wÂ»-re ill
used and punished severely nnd that on
Monday they determined to escape. Plans
were laid accordingly.
SALINAS. Aug. 28.â Hazel Ilutchinson
and Minnie Castro, two little girls 8 and 10
years old respectively, ran away from the
convent In Watsonville in the dead of
night, clad only ln their nightgowns and
shoes and walked to Castroville, a dis
tance of twenty-one miles, and were there
found to-day by Deputy Sheriff "Wallace
in a pitiable condition. They were brought
to this city this evening.

Amona those who fancy Corbett's
changes Is Bob Fitzplmmon9. Although
he does not have a friendly feeling toward
Corbett, he declares that his Judgment
forces him to the conclusion that Corbett
is the superior fighter and will surely de
feat. .McCoy. He says that the toxrner
champion 13 too big, strong aro 'clever* for
McCoy.
"If Corbett." added Fltzsimmon*.
"could successfully stand off a man of
Jeffries' immense physique for twenty
three rounds, what chance has MeCov â
smaller and weaker in every particular
than the California Herculesâ to beat Cor
bett?"
NEW YORK. Aug: 2S.â The fight be
tween Peter Maher and Joe Choynski,
which waa to have taken place at thj
Broadway Athletic Club to-night, had to
be declared off on account of Choynski s*
sickness. About 7 o'clock Choynski hail
un attack of stomach trouble, and a phy
sician who was summoned said that ho
was totally unfit to take part in the con
test. As soon as the management of tho
Broadway Athletic Club heard of this
they declared the bout off and refunded
the money to the spectators who had al
ready paid admission.
Choynski is not seriously afflicted, but it
will b^ impossible .for him to meet Maher
before the expiration of the liorton law.
Boxing of a superior type will be wit
nessed in the arena of tho Twentieth Cen
tury Club at Madison-square Garden
Thursday night, when Corbett and ".h-id
McCoy will put on the gioves.
There la not a trick in the game of hit,
stop and get away with which Corbett and
McCoy are not familiar. With such per
fect knowledge of the finer points of box-
Ing as Corbett and McCoy possess tbera
appears to be but little doubt that It w-U
be the greatest in the history of fistic
battles.
So far as physical condition or these
scientific gladiators Is concerned, there is
little to choose between thÂ«m. McCoy's
friends expect to see htm enter the ring
weighing 173 pounds. This will be ten
pounds heavier than he ever tipped tho
scales. They assert that McCoy can de
liver a much harder blow than the former
heavy-weight champion, and this they be
lieve will give him the victory- It will bo
remembered that in the fight between Mc-
Coy and Sharkey the pale-faced Hoosicr
twice floored the sailor with right-hand
Mows to the jaw, thus giving testimony
to his ability to strike bard and gauga
distance properly.
"Corbett cannot hit straight at all,"
said Sharkey. "He's got to bring his left
around in hook fashion. I thiak McCoy
will reach Corbett wl*b straight lefts and
defeat him Inside of eight rounds."
Many well known experts pick Corbett
as the winner. They do so on the ground
that the former champion Is a bit more
clever than McCoy and a better ring gen
eral. They say that in none of his flghta
has Corbett ever been confused, while
third-raters have been known to upset
McCoy at times.
McCormick's defeat of the Hoosler Is
pointed out as an Instance. In order tr>
win Corbett's friends believe that McCoy
will have to do considerable rushing and
land one of his famous jolts within eight
rounds, but they cannot figure how Mc-
Coy can g?t home such a blow on tho
former champion within the period of
time mentioned.
McCoy and Corbett Both In Prixna
Condition and Each Feels

The Â«mployes of laundries â¢ won their
fight for shorter hours' yesterday before
the Board of Supervisors, when there was
passed to print an amended ordinance fix
ing the period during which they should
labor each day at from 6 a. m. to 7 p. m.
The present ordinance reads from 6 a. m.
until 10 p. m.i pq that three hours will be
taken off the arduous duties of 2000 em
ployes, C5 per cent of whom are, women
and girls. The new ordinance Is substan
tially the same as the old one, the only
change being in the section headed "times
at which laundry work may not be per
formed." The section Is as follows: p}V.
No person or persons owning or employed in
the public laundries or pulilic washhouses pro
vided for In i>eetion 1 of this. ordinance shall
wash, mangle or Iron clothes between the hours
of 7 o'clock p. m. and 6 o'clock a. m., nor upon
any portion of that day known as Sunday.
Labor Commissioner Meyers addressed
the board and said that the old ordinance,
fixing the hours- betwf en 6 a. m. and Vj
p m. had been upheld as a proper police
regulation on the ground that the public
safety ami repose demanded It, and that
It was in the power of the board to change
the hours from 6 a. m. to 7 p. m.- Su
pervisor Curtis said there was no opposi
tion to the ordinance, on the part of the
large laundries. Mayor Phelan said that
the law would have to be â¢enforced strictly
against the Chinese, who were the most
dangerous competitors of white laundries.

" Prince Ansel <2:20Vfe). one of the fastest
racers as a two-year-old in the State, but
for some year3 laid up with a bad leg. is
r.ow working well at the Sacramento
track and finished an easy fifth mile in
2:20V; last quarter in 31 1 ,* seconds, last
eighth in 15 seconds. A half-brother of
Prince Ansel, a pacer, worked a mile in
northern circuit will all meet to
gether for tho first time at Sacramento,
and the entries here are so large and the
classifications so fortunate that the
champions will be all pitted against each
other, and all of the races promise to be
hotly contested.
The Sacramento track, which has been
newly prepared. Is now In perfect condi
tion, and the horsemen are speculating as
to how fast the horses will go in Septem
ber. The excellent condition of the track
could not be better illustrated than by in
stancing the recent performances there by
racers. Bonsaline (2:1<>*V> worked a mile
recently in 2:12 without a break, and Dolly
Dillon (2:13) worked a mile finishing strong
in 2:11. Dora Doe (2:22> worked a mile
with Wild Nutllng. timed by Sam Gamble,
J. C. Bunch and Mlllard Sanders, in 2:15,
making the la.st quarter in 21 seconds.
Little Thorn worked the first quarter of
the track In 30 seconds â the fastest time

SACRAMENTO, Aug. 2S.-Interest in
the harness racing to take place at
the State Fair meeting is con
stantly increasing. The horses
that have been performing on the
board of an interpreter of the Japanese
language for the Police Courts was re
ferred to the Mayor for recommendation
as to the necessity for the employment of
the interpreter.
The City Attorney was requested to pro
cure from ex-City Treasurer A. C. "Widber
a quitclaim deed to all the real estate
owned by him in favor of tho city and
county.
The City Attorney was asked for an
opinion as to the advisability of the city
accepting an ofTer of $1225 by W. H.
Rhodes for the Mountain View, Santa
Clara County, property which reverts to
the city in the suit against A. C. Wirtber.
. A resolution was adopted directing the
Health and Fire departments, Board of
Public Works, department of electricity,
City and County Hospital and Almshouse
to pay for their own stationery.
' A resolution was adopted authorizing
the Mayor to accept a bequest of $189 70
made by Mrs. Antonla Verdugo do Vor

directing the Treasurer and Auditor to
audit and pay to I^ouls Kaiser, United
States Consul at Mazatlan. the sum of
$24 47 as a fee and for expenses In collect
ing the bequest.
The board adjourned to meet on Wednes
day next.
One of the races at the meeting which
will attract the most interest is the Oc
cident stake of 1901. which will be trotted
at Sacramento. September 3. the first day
of the fair. This stake closed January 1,
1S98, with fifty-seven entries. Of this num
ber only four have made final payment,
but they are four of the highest clas3
three-year-olds that ever started in a
futurity stake. The Occident stake has
been an annual event with the Stale Agri
cultural Society for many years, and the
fastest time ever made in it was the walk
over by Sunol. In 2:\& l Â±; the fastest time
ever made in a contest was 2:19 1 ,*> by L.a
Belle.
The four racers that will contest thl.i
year are Eulah Mac. by McKlnney (2:11).
dam Balance All <2:2^V>). by Brigadier;
Vendome, by Iran Alta (2:12',i). dam Linda
Oak (2:21%). by Guy Wilkes; The Roman,
by McKlnney (2:11>. dam Wanda (2:14?i).
by Eros, and Tom Smith, by McKinney
(2:11), dam Daisy S, by McDonald Chief.
Eulah Mac took a two-year-old record
of 2:27% and went a mile at Santa Rosa
early this summer in 2:19. .In a work
out mile she has gone'a half in 1:04,- and
from present reports she has made con
stant improvement and Is deemed capa
ble of a sensational performance. â¢
Tom Smith is showing superior form at
Sacramento. Ho. worked a mile about two
weeks ago in 2:19V* and has been con
stantly improving.
Feature of the Harness Events.
2:21. last quarter in 31*4 feeonds and last
eighth in 15 <beccnds. tJmed by a dozen
watches. These showings justify the con
fidence that when the horses meet at. Sac
ramento all track records will be broken,
and many of our coast records will go
with them.
Recently cut rates and other devices
have been employed to increase this moo.
erately handsome daily pie gorge. Not
long ago it was difficult to get a pie with
two whole, non-leathery lids and unlm
peachable filling for .7 cents. Now it is
easy to buy a pie for restaurant use for
a nickelâ no questions asked and no back
talk taken. Not only are cut rates of
fered, but pie '"spielers" have appeared
on the scene, to urge their goods upon
the restaurant trade. Where prices are
the same the restaurateur is invited u
become a pie taster, or pie "tester." antk
the result has been pastry devouring or
gies that have had no parallel since "Sim
ple Simon met the pieman" and "little
Jack Homer put In his thumb and pulled
out a plum:".
The origin of the pie war is not made
plain. Simkins & Thorp and J. W. Thorp
& Co. are known to have had a falling
out. and some restaurateurs trace the
present devastating pie price war to them.
The head of Thorp & Co. is father of
Henry "U*. Thorn of , Simkins & Thorp.
The senior Thorp came to the coast on
the advice of Henry W. Thorp and was
for ii time foreman for his son. Then
Thorp Sr, went off and started another
concern, and there has been lively rivalry
and keen competition for the pie supply
business among the Thorps ever since.
When the pie war was fairly on Albert
G. Simkins went East to see what new
wrinkies there were in Eastern pies. He
came back, recently, having made thr
tour of many bakeries and knowledge of
this quest for pie lore hair stimulated the
"spielers." Possibly the effect will be to
push on the daily pio consumption of San
Francisco by 10.000 additional pies, for the
low prices and consequent added . profU
for restaurateurs will furnish them an
inducement to urge, pio where the cus
tomer Is compliant.. .
There are three pie bakeries In San
Francisco that supply the restaurant and
grocery store trade. It is carefully esti
mated that at ieast 34,000 pies are daily
consumed in San Francisco, or about on*,
to every ten persons, including babes in
arms. â¢ ' :
There is a pie war on in San Francisco.
That statement will be news to thousands
who daily dare dyspepsia through its
great American agent.

By the record and according 1 to reports
the filly Eulah Mac has the foot of the
Held. The three colts, however, are but a
short way behind her. and from their well
known ptamlna and the racehorsn qualities
shown by them it would not be safe to count
any one of them outside of tlrst money.
It may be that Eulah Mac will be driven
out in* the first heat of the race in as good
as 2:12, and perhaps forced the second mile
up to hor limit. If this is done split heats
nre likely to follow, and the race will then
become an open one, with a fair chance
for any of the four.
From any standpoint this race will be a
preat one. It will be the greatest Occi
dent stake ever trotted in California. It
will be one of the greatest three-year-old
races to botrotted in the United States
this year and oncof tho greatest futurity
harness races that ever took place, com
paring favorably with the famous Ken
tucky Futurity race .of 1S99, . when Bor
alma won, getting a record of 2:13, and
where the famous California three-year
old. Idoletta, trotted two heats in 2:12,
and yet failed to obtain any part of the
stake.
Eulah. Mac's Chances.
V<? ndome is a full brother to Dr. Frasse
(2:22) and Dr. Frasse's Sister (2:2">V*s), the
winner of the, Stanford stake last year.
He is a sreat bred colt and in a split heat
raoe, driven by J. C. Bunch, will show
the qualities he inherits from his grand
sirp. Palo Alto (2:08%). ""'*/Â¦Â£
The Roman is being much talked of by
the Sacramento track people and is touted
as a probable winner of this great stake.
He went a mile several weeks ago in 2:19*2
and worked a mile recently in the middle
of the track in 2:17. a performance con
servatively estimated to be equal to 2:lo
at the pole.

Under this authority. President McKin

DELEGATES TO THE
ARBITRATION COMMISSION
THE eighteen resolute find fair
minded Republicans who
were appointed by Chairman
Bouvier to act as a return
ing board have not swerved
a hair's breadth from their
original purpose to render
equal and exact justice to all factions of
the party. The important work of the com
mittee is very nearly finished. A few wit
nesses may yet be called to afford more
light on several disputed points.
Tremendous pressure has been brought
to bear to break down the board and
transfer the important duty of canvass
ing the returns to the Kelly and Crimmins
faction. The official call for the primary
election provided that the returns from
the various polling places should be
transmitted to the headquarters of the Re
publican County Committee and there
canvassed. It is true that the defeated
and outgeneraled bosses would be pleased
to have the returns sent to the Mint Sa
loon and the credentials issued by Martin
Kelly ajid Phil Crimmins, but the pro
gramme is too raw.
Special efforts are being put forward by
the boss elements to create confusion in
the party and embarrass the board in the
work of honorably adjusting the differ
ences In local ranks. Adroit plans were
laid to Involve the State Central Com
mittee in the city controversy. Kelly and
Crimmins embraced in a Congressional j
primary scheme a proposition to nominate â¢
candidates for the Legislature by persons j
other than those elected as delegates un
der the auspices of the County Committee.
The motive of the boss was to compel In
terference on the part of the State Com
mittee. The scheme failed because George
In the first place it was decided that
credentials of delegates to the county con
vention are to be issued bj' the chairman
and secretary of the returning board upon
the order of the board. N T o credentials
will be issued to delegates from districts
the returns of which have not been sub
mitted to the board, even though there
may be no contest. To further facilitate
its business the returning board decided
that all credentials shall be issued by to
morrow (Thursday) night. In conse
quence election officers or district com
mitteemen who fail to take Shiels Hall re
turns to the returning board before its
adjournment to-night will Insure the ab
sence of the names of their delegates from
the temporary roll, at least, of the county
convention.
The returning board of eighteen held a
short but important meeting at the Coun
ty Central Committee headquarters last
night. It decided several questions of
prime importance with a celerity that
gives the lie to the assertions that It has
been an impotent body with neither the
Inclination nor the authority to deal with
tne questions submitted to it.
chosen to represent the Republicans of
San Francisco in the nominating conven
tions will receive their credentials attest
ed according to the call for a primary
election Issued by the Republican County
Committee. These delegates will organize
the municipai convention. Kelly and
Crimmins may introduce a bolting side
show. The bosses care nothing for Re
publican harmony and success. They
sell out to the hizheKfc bidder in every
campaign. They betrayed the Republican
party in the Budd-Estee election and
worked hand and glove with Rainey and
Phelan one year ago.
Two obscure rewspapers, one of which
was hired to revile Horace Davis and sup
port Phelan for Mayor, are trying to cre
ate the impression - that the returning
board is weak and Irresolute. The fact
that a meeting of the County Committee
Is called for next Saturday evening is in
terpreted as a sign that Kelly and Crim
mins have gained a point. The truth is
that the meeting is called for September
1 in older to obviate the necessity of hold
ing a similar meeting on September b.
Many of the committeemen desire to at
tend the State Convention at Santa Cruz
on September 5, and as the regular meet
ing of the County Committee is set for
that day an earlier meeting is ordered.
Before next Saturday the delegates

in a drawer as a matter of convenience,
but no official record of the receipt ot
such returns is made. It is posrfble that
the checkmated bosses will ultimately of
fer the rejected returns to the canvassing
board of the County Committee, and may
have the audacity' to request that creden
tials be issued on the face of such cooked
up and peddled around rubbish.
Stcne, chairman, and \V. M. Cutter, sec
retary of the governing body took a firm
and determined position not to interfere
In local affairs. .
The first failure did not discourage the
bosses. They tried another plan. The
second plan was an order for boss-ridden
districts to ignore the plain provisions of
the special call for the primary election
and send returns to the headquarters of
the State Committee in the Palace Hotel
after such had been "fixed" at Shiels Hall
in a manner to suit the stuffers.

union among all the teamsters of the city.
Agents were around interviewing the men
yesterday and a meeting is to be called at
an early date for organization.
The executive committee of the Building
Trades Council held another special meet-
Ing last evening. The question of running
the eight-hour mills on Labor day was
discussed, and it was finally voted to al
low the men in these mills to work on
Labor day if they chose. They will also
be allowed to work any other day or night
that the employers may wish in order to
catch up wilh the work. The same pay
that they are now receiving for a work
day will prevail. The council listened to
th* reports of the business agents, which
were very encouraging and showed gains
for the millmen.
Andrew Wllkie, chairman of the press
committee of the Millowners' Associa
tion, was asked yesterday if the two out-,
of-town mills that the millmen have won
over to their side would have much effect
upon the present situation. "Not the
slightest," Mr. Wilkie replied. "Why, the
two together don't employ over a dozen
hands, if I am correctly informed. I
never heard of them before.
"There is no change in the situation in
so far as we are concerned. I am told
that one of the mills that conceded to the
eight-hour demand now threatens to go
back to nine hours, claiming that the
Trades Council has not lived up to its
agreement.
"I think a general strike is close at
hand. I predict that it will come within
a few days. We are waiting for it. Mr.
McCarthy threatened some time ago that
unless we gave in all the building trades
in the city would be called out, and we are
anxiously waiting the fulfillment of hia
boast."
Â¦\Yilliam Crocker stated that about two
thirds of the mills are now running full
time. The others can get sufficient help
to run fully equipped if they wish.

The^ upshot of the libel suit of Charles
Williams against The Call was a verdict
of onp cent damages, awarded last week
by a jury in the United States Circuit
â¢Court at San Francisco. This fellow Wil
liams was "exposed by The Call as a
rascally adventurer, at a time when he
was engaged to be married to a San Fran
cisco heiress. That he had the assurance
to sue The Call, under the circumstances,
is astonishing. He asked for damages to
the amount of $255,000. and the award of
one cent shows the jury's estimate of the
injury his reputation suffered.
The Call did society a service In Its
revelation of. Williams' shady career, and
Is tfntitled to commendation.
The Bee has been the defendant In many
libel suits of a like kind, and' always came
out triumphant. Juries may be trusted
to stand by a newspaper that does its duty
in showing up frauds and impostors.

In a local gallery this week may be seen
a number of new pictures. Including two
interesting Moorish subjects of Paul La

landscape of Northern Africa. There Is

is also fairly interesting, a study of fo

Miss Anna Frances Bribes has taken a
studio in the old Art Association build

artists. \
pictures of the late R. T>. Yelland will
be held some time in the early autumn
in the studio of the late artist, In East
Oakland.
Of course, the response -was immediate.
The artist was besieged by would-be stu
dents, and soon tho two studiosâ one for
men and one for womenâ were crowded
with the cleverest of the Parisian art pu
pils. But soon it was observed that the
eccentric maitre devoted an altogethei
disproportionate share of attention to the
feminine portion of his clientele, with the
result that the other Half became furious
ly jealous. Whistler, however, serenely
disregarded the rising discontent, only ac
knowledging its existence by an emphatic
statement, that the future of art was in
the hands of womenâ a sufficiently re
markable dictum, but probably only rep
resentative of a momentary mood. . .
Among the list of those fortunate
enouph to be admitted into the Whistler
ranks, the Californian grirls claJm an un
usual proportion. During. Mr. Whistler's,
two winters of teaching no fewer than
five Californian girls have studied with
him-'-Miss Mabel Deming of Sacra
mento, Miss Marion Holden, Miss Carrie
Rixford. Mrs. A. Â¦ F. Matthews and 'MlsÂ»
Florence Lundborgâ and held their - own
there, and perhaps a little more, with the
rest of the American continBent. Mr.
Whistler did not teach last winter, but
announces a present intention of resum
ing his studio classes during the nexi
winter season. '
Miss Lundborj? has not settled down to
serious work yet; she is perhaps resting
a little on her Parisian laurels. Tht
"Rubaiyat," which this clever Californian
â¢has illustrated for Doxey, will
be out in the early autumn, as well as an
illustrated edition of "The Recessional."
Aaron Altman, a promising", young
San Francisco artist, has been appointed
assistant master of sketching and per
1 spectlve v at the California School - of De

Hopkins School, and has since studied for

There is no legal casuistry about such a decision as
that. It does not deprive Lord Rosebery of any
right to his own speeches. He can write them out
and publish them when he pleases, but he cannot take
the report that some one else has written out. The
decision is a victory for the principle that "the laborer
is worthy of his hire." If Rosebery wishes to profit
by the work which a newspaper has done and paid
for he must pay for it. He cannot^stcal it. Such is

reported speech that will exclude the right of the
author of the speech to use it in any way he. chooses.
In deciding the case in favor of the Times, the Lord
Chancellor stated that no man has a right to take to
himself the work of another without paying for it.
Rosebery or any other orator can have his speeches
taken down by a stenographer and printed if he
chooses, but if he does not choose he cannot then
take the reports of some other man who has done
the reporting and the printing at his own expense.
To make a report requires skill and labor, and to
publish the result requires capital, and no man has a
right to . appropriate to himself what has been
achieved by the labor, the skill and the capital of an-
REPORTS from London are to the effect that
the recent decision of the House of Lords re
straining Lord Rosebcry from republishing
his speeches from the Times is "scoffed at as^a ridicu
lous example of legal casuistry." The scoffers have,
of course, given much less consideration to the sub
ject' than the Judges who decided it. and that is the
reason they scoff. On the face of the case the de^
cision doe's indeed appear absurd, but a moment's re
flection will, we believe, convince any one that es
sential justice has been done and that the decision is
as sound in morals as in law.
It will be remembered that the facts of the case are
these: Some time ago Lord Rosebery desired to
publish a volume of his speeches and addresses, and
entered into an agreement with a publisher named
Lane to do the work. In preparing the volume cer
tain copies of speeches were taken from the London
Times without alteration and. included in the volume.
The Times brought suit to have the publication re
strained on the ground that it would be a violation
of the Times copyright of its reports. It was claimed
by Lane that Rosebery is the author of the speeches,
that the Times reporter is not the author of them,
and that no reporter can obtain a copyright on 2
REPORTERS' COPYRIGHT.
IN a vigorous and eloquent sermon re
cently preached to a large and fashion
able congregation of summer residents
at Southampton, L. I., Gib
bons referred pointedly to the "new
woman" and the shortcomings of women
of the social set.
The Cardinal, by Inference rather than
by set words, gave his auditors to under
stand that he had no sympathy with the
woman advocates of woman's rights.
"The Holy Spirit In the Old Testament,"
he said, "pays a beautiful and well-mer
ited tribute to woman and to woman's po
sition in society. 'Who shall find a val
iant woman?' say the Scriptures, indicat
ing that woman should be found attend
ing to her domestic duties rather than
mingling in the strife of the world.
"What is it the Holy Spirit commands in.
woman?
"Does he admire her because of her
social triumphs; because she is a brilliant
leader in society?
"Does he commend her because she is
an advocate of certain so-called female
privileges?
"Does he commend her because she goes
about from place to place, ascending here
a rostrum and there a rostrum, and ad
vocating the rights and privileges of
women? \.
The Ideal Woman.
"Not at all. The Holy Spirit does aver
that she is simply a loving wife, an ef
fectionate mother, a benevolent mistress
to the members of her. household; as the
guardian of the domestic arrangements
she is ever faithful; she looks well to the
requirements of her household, and she
does not eat her meat in Idleness. She at
tends to the little things of this life, and
she does them well.
"He had done all things well," said Car
dinal Gibbons In commencing his sermon.
"The multitude came to our dear Saviour
and they praised him not because of the
great exploits he had accomplished as the
conqueror of men, but because he did all
things well for the glory of his Father
and , the welfare of humanity, small as
well as great.
The Small Things of Life.
"I propose to make a special plea in be
half of the small things of life. I hold that
our sanctiflcation here and our salvation
hereafter do not depend upon the accom
plishment of great achievements, but
rather upon the faithful, diligent per
formance of the commonplace daily duties
of our lifeâ our public and domestic duty,
the manner in which we go about our
daily avocations, the attitude we main
tain, in society, our conversation one to
another, and the way in which we conduct
ourselves during the recreation which we
are enjoying here in this beautiful world.
"I hold it as an axiom that we can
sanctify all this work. It matters not to
God whether we are a kins or a clown
on the stage of life; the great object is to
fill faithfully the post to which God has
assigned us.

CABDINAIi GIBBONS PREACHING.
WHO WAS LINCOLN?
THE current knowledge of the men of his time
and history should have quite thoroughly
established (he position of Lincoln in American
politics.
He announced the irrepressible conflict between
freedom and slavery and was one of the founders and
leaders of the Republican party, opposed to the Dem
ocracy. He was the Republican nominee for the
Presidency in i860 and was elected. The Democracy
split and ran two candidates against him, Douglass
and Breckinridgc. Of the popular vote Lincoln had
1,866,352, Douglass 1,375.157 and Breckinridge 845,
763; Bell, the silver-gray Whig, had 589,581. Lincoln
had a plurality of 491,195 votes over his highest
Democratic opponent and in a total electoral vote of
303 had 180. Douglass 12, Breckinridge 72, Bell 39.
In iFfo, in accepting his first nomination to Con
gress, Mr. Blaine said: "In the election of 1856 the
opponents of the Democracy were divided. But this
year, in the good providence of God, the division
comes in the Democracy itself, and we can felicitate
ourselves that the strife bctween^Mr. Douglass and
Mr. Brcckinridge will in all probability give the elec
tion to the Republicans of the United States and that
Abraham Lincoln, if he lives, will be the next Presi
dent."
In 1864 Lincoln was opposed to the Democracy,
which denounced the conduct of the war and rallied
under McCIellan, and shortly after his inauguration he
was assassinated. The line of demarcation between
Republicanism and Democracy had one of its latest
illustrations in a Democratic doorkeeper of a Demo
cratic House of Representatives in Washington, who
named his boy John Wilkes Booth in honor of the
assassin of Lincoln.
All this history and reminiscence seems necessary
to recall to the country the personality of Lincoln and
his relation lo the principles for which he stood.
Colonel Bryan is letting him up in the temple of
Democracy as one of the worthies of that party and
the results come pretty near to being amusing. The
State convention of the Iowa Democracy was held ten
days ago. The speech, called a great speech, which
put life and mettle into that convention, was made by
its chairman. Mr. Deimon. Mr. Denison handles the
tongue of a ready speaker. He was lurid, perfervid, pro
lific, prophetic and reminiscent. The temperature in
his vicinity must have raised a number of degrees, but
it the genius of history were present she must have
nearly swallowed her quill pen in astonishment.
Mr. Denison said: "From the ranks of the Dem
ocracy in time of need came the leaders who stood
against privilege and against aggression upon the
rights of the people â Jefferson. Jackson and Lincoln.
Now when defiant Republicanism attempts to annul
the declaration and make the constitution but a char
ter of trade: when the ensign that has stood for free
dom from the days of George III down to the days of
McKinley â when this ensign is made the symbol of
subjection, the pennant of polygamy and the flag of
force, then again the times demand a man. And again
the .Democracy, that furnished a Jefferson, that pro
vided a Jackson, that produced a Lincoln, comes for
ward with a man."
Of course, this new man completing Mr. Deni
son's Democratic quartet is Colonel Bryan.
It now remains for some Bryanic orator to de
nounce Jeff Davis as the founder of the Republican
party, prove that Mark Hanna assassinated Lincoln,
that Grant led the disunion forces and that Lee de
feated him at Appomattox and restored the Union,
nnd the perversion of history will be complete and
the diversion of the public without a flaw! In his
second message to Congress, Lincoln said, "We
cannot escape history." but Colonel Bryan seems to
think differently and Mr. Denison is radically of the
same opinion.
The cold and sober truth is that every charge of
tyranny and imperialism mada now against President
McKinley by Colonel Bryan was made against Lin
coln by the Democracy. Men who were yet living
and supporting Bryan in 1896 declared in 1864 that
Lincoln's re-election would usher in the empire.
We venture therefore to re-emboss the pages of his
tory^on which the public life of Lincoln is written and
venture to deny that he was the Democratic candidate
for the Presidency in jS6o and 1864.
MORE FOREST FIRES.
YESTERDAY'S dispatches from Lo> Angeles
announced that ten square miles in the San Ga
briel reserve had been swept over hy a forest
fire and that the flames were still raging at the time
the latest report was received. Here then is another
of those disastrous lessons which in time will teach
Californians that a neglect of forest preservation is
one of the worst follies of which a commonwealth can
be guilty.
The question is. how long will it be before the peo
ple learn wisdom from the lessons? For years past
it has been evident to all intelligent persons that the
annual loss to the State by fires in the woods or the
fields is far in excess of what it would cost to provide
a system of protection which, if not wholly prevent
ing the outbreak of such fires, would at least render
them less frequent "i.nd less destructive. Notwith
standing that knowledge, hardly anything has bee;i
done to guard against the annually recurring loss. It
is as if the people had made up their minds neither to
heed the lesson themselves nor to listen to those who
have heeded it, no matter what their stubbornness
cost them.
We are now about to elect a Legislature to assem
ble this winter. Would it not be worth while for in
telligent men in all parts of the State to impress upon
the candidates of each party the importance of pro
viding for forestry laws at once and to obtain from
each of them a pledge that if elected he will do what
lie can to promote the desired legislation at the com
ing session?
Of all the States in the Union. California is per
haps the chief sufferer by forest fires. It is not that
?uch fires arc more common here than elsewhere, or
that they sweep over wider areas, but that the rela
tions of our forests to the mountains and the valleys
znd to the \vater courses of the State are more im
portant than in any other district of similar extent in
the country. If the mountains and the higher hills be
denuded of the forests hardly any portion of Cali
fornia will be capable of supporting a population suf
ficiently numerous to maintain a high degree of civili
zation. Our forests are vital not only to our pros
perity but to our existence.
If the changes which our water courses have already
undergone are not sufficient to show the trend 04.
things resulting from the destruction of forests, a
complete lesson on the subject can be found by even
the most casual study of what has taken place in the
Old World. Some of the regions which in former
times were the richest and most capable of supporting
human life in the highest degree of civilization arc
now so poor as to be veritable deserts. Nor is there
any doubt that the change from wealth to wretched
ness among the inhabitants of those districts has been
due almost wholly to the destruction of the forests,
which in old times clothed the hills and acted as
natural reservoirs of the streams.
Sooner or later California will have to adopt a com
prehensive system of forest protection and every year
of delay is an economic blunder of the most costly
kind. If we do not 2Ct promptly to save the woods
we have it will not be long before we shall have to
enter upon a highly expensive and slow system of re
foresting the bare hills. It is cheaper and better to
save what we have than to waste the rich stores of to
day and then toil for a century to partially replace
them.
The issue is before the people. The object lessons
are multiplying fast. Not a week passes without
some such record as that which has just been received
from Los Angeles. Forest protection, therefore,
should be made an issue in the State campaign. Let
us send to Sacramento this winter a body of men
pledged to make a beginning at least in the work of
providing a scientific and adequate system of forest
and water preservation.
THE SOUTH AFRICAN STRUGGLE.
ONXE more Lord Roberts has cheered the Brit
ish public with the announcement that he has
one of the chief armies of the Boers cornered
so that it cannot escape. This time it is Botha who
is supposed to be surrounded and Buller and Pole-
Carcw are the British commanders who have the task
of crushing him. Perhaps the sanguine expectations
of Roberts may this time be realized, but it will be
remembered that last week Dewet was believed to be
surrounded, but managed to get away, and Botha may
have an equal skill in dodging his foes.
It has been a military marvel that the Boer com
manders have held out so long against the over
whelming forces against them. They are pursued by
half a dozen armies, each larger than their own.
When one British force is wearied another takes up
the- pursuit, but the Boers have no relief. Their
marching and fighting are incessant and nothing but a
patriotism of the firmest and most inspiring order
could uphold them so long in a struggle against their
powerful foes.
Even the British have recognized the skill and the
valor of their opponents and some among them have
openly acknowledged the merit of the Boers and
their leaders. The w:ir correspondent of the London
Telegraph, for example, recently said of Dewet:
"Rundle, Hunter and Methucn are chasing him for
three months; he has held the former at bay. Thirty
thousand men are watching, for him on the borders of
Natal; he has swooped on the lines of communica
tion, and apparently, with a paltry 7000 men, is keep
ing them all busy. A whole battalion of yeomanry,
a regiment of militia and warm clothing for his whole
army have been captured. Honor to whom honor is
due, and the first time an English cavalry leader, act
ing under the same conditions as now surround De
wet, captures 1000 men, half of them cavalry; breaks
up lines of communication and plays general Old
Harry with a force of something very near 80,000
men. then I shall speak of him in terms of approba
tion."
' Dcwet's 7000 meh have been scattered. At the
latest reports he had buried his artillery, divided his
force into small bands and taken to the hills. Botha,
it appears, is cornered. So the long struggle seems
to be nearing the end at last. It began with the Boer
ultimatum delivered last October and has, therefore,
been going on for nearly a. year. Buller expected to
eat his Christmas dinner last year as a conqueror in
Pretoria. He will do well if he has the satisfaction of
eating it in peace this year. Should he do so it will
not be a matter of much glory for him. He will have
to look back upon a year of struggle which, if it has
not staggered humanity, has at least cost Great Brit
ain dearly. By the War Office summary, issued at
the end of July, the British casualties for the war
amounted to 2731 killed in action, 732 died of wounds,
4867 died of diseases, 85 .died in captivity and there
Recent news from South Africa has the old familiar
tone which first characterized the story of events in
the war between the Boers and the British. General
Buller has been trapped again by his clever enemy.
The blindness of organizations and men engaged in
the stock business in opposing this policy is one of the
vexatious problems of the West. They can abso
lutely dictate the salvation of the ranges and the
permanency of their own business, if they will, and to
refrain means their own impoverishment and the de
struction of one great source of national wealth.
The leasing policy is being forced by natural condi
tions and must prevail if the whole range business is
not to see a speedy end. The conditions of this sum
mer in Arizona, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, Montana
and Eastern Oregon should impress the dullest ob;
server and overawe the most persistent demagogue.
If not, the meat food and hide supply of the country
is about to suffer an impairment so severe as to tax
unduly millions of our own consumers and stop a
profitable export trade to the consumers of other
countries, who are. our customers.
The lesson is a severe one, but if taken to heart all
the loss will not be -without its benefits. These semi
arid ranges should be used in common no more.
They should b'c v leased to those who use them, under
enforced conditions that will restore the lost forage,
give to the land the protection of vegetable cover
p.rtd roots to conserve its moisture and restore the
only and best use of which it is capable.
The devastated ranges were fine, in their primitive
condition, and if protected against overfeeding, would
still be in full vigor. The moisture would not have
been lost and the springs, now dry, would be af
fluent.
These starved sheep are offered at $1 per head,
but are not worth it, because no feed is in sight to
keep them alive and put them in condition for win
tering.
To get what feed there was the free range has been
grossly overcrowded and now there is nothing left.
It is the story of the Riviere des Chutes of Southern
Utah and the Tonto Basin of Arizona over again.
Wyoming sheep by thousands are too poor to go on
winter range, and should first be fed hay, but where
the hay is to come from no flockmaster knows. - The
loss is expected to reach 25 per cent, and as the herders
are inclined to minimize the" evil* it is probable that
it will be nearer 50 per cent.
rEEDING to the destruction of feed in Wyom
ing has produced its natural result. The de
crease in moisture which has followed is finish
ing the destruction of some of the finest ranges that
ever existed. The soil being laid bare, what moisture
falls runs off quickly or rapidly evaporates and stock
is left without support.

the works of the various schools that it
is necessary to visit almost every country
in Kurope to see the full manifestation*
of ita complex art. Of the quality of
Dutch and Flemish art one can learn

The German galleries are rich in Italian
pictures generally. A very famous worn
belonging to the Dresden gallery is the
"Reading Magdalen," for many years
ascribed to Correprgio, but now believed
by experts to be the work of Allori. a later
rainter of the Florentine school. The sub
ject of this penitent in the desert, accom
panied by improving: literature and human
skulls, has bren a favorite with many of
the older painters. She is commonly shown
in tears, but here she seems to be entirely
cheerful and serene. The flesh tones are
pale and greenish, not at all like Correg
gio's, and the picture is painted on copper,
which is said never to have been used for
paintings until at least half a century
after Correggio's time. Much more char
acteristic of Corieggio is the famous pict
ure of the nativity in Dresden usually
known as "The Night." In light and shade
the painter appears here in his best vein,

beautiful touch of imagination, appearing

As with the Italian masters, so in a still
greater degree is it with those of Spainâ
the German galleries give us an introduc
tion to them merely, for full acquaintance
is to be obtained only in their own coun
try. Of a certain class of Murillo's works
we can gain knowledge hereâ his early
pictures of street life. The Munich Gal
lery has a unique group of these works.
The most familiar example depicts two
beggar boys playing at dice, with another
toy and a dog near by. and in the fore
ground a basket of fruit. These works
are realistic, clever and popular, but they
represent Murillo in a field which he aban
doned entirely when his higher powers
were awakened. The touch of nature,
however, in these early works is unques
tionably that which makes them so widely
admired by the populace. To Velasquez,
the greatest of Spanish artists, the Ber
lin Gallery gives us a pleasant introduc
tion through the remarkable portrait of
Alexander del Borro. To artists this
work is especially interesting, owing to
the peculiarity of its lighting and for its
skillful foreshortening, for it was painted
to be seen from below, and the proper de
lineation of its proportions made demands
Â«.
to proceed from the figure of the Infant
Christ, brightly shining upon the faces
near it and shading delicately off into the
landscape, in whose calm twilight seems
to appear the foreshadowing of the new
sun that is Just rising above the world.
Titian is very well represented in Ger
many, especially in the Dresden gallery.
One must visit Italy to see him in his
greatest works, but there are several of
his easel paintings in Germany that call
for attention. His painting of Mary Mag
dalene, with SS. Jerome and Paul before
the Virgin, child and John the Baptist, is
a description of moral thought rather
than material fact, and presents the idea
of the heavenly mercy that awaits the
repentant sinner. The expression of the
Virgin's face is particularly admired.* 1
have heard it spoken of as the embodi
ment of all feminine charm. The Dresden
gallery is rich in another class of works
In which Titian surpassed all painters â de
scriptions of the female form, to which
classical titles were given, but which in
fact were splendid studies of the nude.
The ability to paint the human form is
universally recognized as the greatest
technical endowment that a painter can
possess. Besides the wonderful perfection
of skill shown in these works, they might
be called a liberal education in this do
main of art. The dignity, beauty, spon
taneity and purity of these works are in
describable.
this Jovial canvas is Rembrandt's contri
bution to the collection. He appears never
to have wearied of painting hia youns
wife, whom death took from him after
eight years of rare happiness. Here also
is the earliest known portrait of her.
painted in 1633, a year before the mar
riage, and probably at about the time of
Rembrandt's first acquaintance with her.
But the most beautiful of all the por
traits of Saskla Is that in which she is
seen holding out a pink in her extended
hand. She stands In full, fair light, wear
ing tip>x her face an expression at once
sweet and sad. as if a hint had come to
her cf the death that wa3 to befall her a
few months later. Still another llkenes.4
of her Is interesting a3 having been
painted two years after her death, from
memory, no doubt. This \s in the Berlin
gallery, and is accounted one of Rem
brandt's best female heads. As with
Rembrandt, so with Van Dyck. one must
visit the German galleries to see many of
his best portraits. A notable example of
his work is the group in the Berlin gal
lery representing the children of the Ill
fated King Charles I of England. ThÂ»
figure with the hand above the dog's head
is that of the boy who became afterward
Charles II: the boy at the right, who
looks like a girl In long clothes, became
James II. and beside him is Mary, who
became the mother of King William.
Hardly any other master makes so
strong a representation In the German
galleries as Rubens. His "Arab Lion
Hunt" in the Munich gallery is one of
the most vigorous animal paintings in
the world, beyond compare in action,
drawing and color. It is a terrible pic
ture; a scene of blood, savagery, agony
and confusion. It is painted with such
ease and mastery that it exhibits abso
lutely no sense of effort. It was painted
when the artist was at the zenith of ais
powers, in his forty-second year. Rubens'
"Last Judgment." or. as it is sometimes
called. "Fall of the Damned." also in the
Munich gallery, where there Is a whMe
roomful of his works, equals the wildest
action of Tintoretto or the majestic power
of Michael Angelo. Imagination indulges
the most lawless flights and description
strains its utmost power. Weighted by
sin. pursued by condemnation from oh
high, the fall of the lost from the heights
of heaven to the lowest depths of hell i*
pictured with irresistible and overwhelm
ing dramatic force. No work in the world
makes a more amazing display of
draughtsmanship.

Mexico came in through the Golden Gate
The resolution requiring the Presidio
and Ferries Railroad Company to set back
at its own expense, temporarily for four
feet, the south curb of Union street, be
tween Hyde and Larkin streets, and to
pave the strip with basalt blocks, provided
that upon rebuilding its roadbed it shall
remove its tracks to the center line of the
street and restore the above mentioned
strip to the sidewalk in front of Â¦ Mrs.
Reynolds* premises, was laid over for one
week. Secretary Laton of the company
claimed that to move the rails to the cen
ter of the street now would cost $20,000.
as the road would have to be stopped for
months. On motion of Supervisor McCar
thy the City Engineer was directed to as
certain the estimated cost of the contem
plated change. .
C. E. Heegard petitioned the board to
improve the block on Twentieth street, be
tween Howard and Folsom, which
he says, is one of the main residence
blocks in the Mission and is allowed to
remain In a most disgraceful condition.
A resolution was adopted requesting the
City Attorney to give his opinion as to the
legality of a resolution adopted by a
former Board of Supervisors on November
28, 1892, declaring Its intention to close up
certain streets enumerated, lying south ot
Channel street, In Mission Bay district,
and also as to the validity of the ordei
adopted on the same date overruling ob
jections to and vacating the streets men
tioned. The board desires to know if the
action taken was in conformity with the
act of the Legislature providing for clos
ing up, in whole or in part, any street,
and what action, if any, can be taken by
the board if deemed necessary to open the
streets as originally laid out.
The streets were closed upon the writ
ten promise of, the Southern Pacific Com
pany to make certain improvements in the
inclosed territory, which promise. It has
been alleged, has not been carried out.
In order to prevent delay the Board -of
Public Works was authorized to make an
expenditure of $10,000 for the construction
of an earth fill and a concrete and brick
culvert at the crossing of Nineteenth ave
nue and Trocadero Gulch, including the
macadamizing of Nineteenth avenue: also
to expend $7000 for removing the cobbles
from and repavlng Main street, between
Mission and Howard streets: also to ex
pend $1720 for the construction of twelve
storm water inlets and fourteen catch
basins on Mission street, between Naglee
avenue and Crescent avenue, and on Ama
zon street. Â¦ '
A petition was filed by residents and
property owners asking that a part of the
appropriation of $10,000 to improve San
Bruno road, between Fifteenth avenue
and the Six-Mile House, be used for the
repair of the road from Twenty-fifth
street to Fifteenth avenue, it being repre
sented that it is in a deplorable condi
tion.
It was further resolved that Superin
tendent Osborne be notified that the city
and county will not be .responsible here
after for the maintenance and care of the
following named inmates: Daniel Henry
and Sarah Franklin. Ella J. Woodman.
Fannie Kauffman, Bessie Whear, Fritz
Hackmeier, Fred Jennings, Charles Quinn,
Lucy Quinn and C. Romer, whose guard
ians have stated they would provide for
them.
There are a number of persons In the Cali
fornia Home for Feeble-Minded Children who
are maintained at the expense of this city and
county whose parents . or guardians can af
ford to pay for their maintenance; and there
la a number ot persons In said home whose
parents or guardians are unknown to the
superintendent, and the board has no Informa
tion that they are unable to pay for their main
tenance; and the appropriation set aside for
this fiscal year for maintaining inmates In the
home, the expense of which Is chareeable to
this city and county. Is Inadequate to meet
the demands.
The preamble of the resolution reads:
A resolution was introduced by Super
visor Connor at yesterday's meeting of
the board providing that thy Judges of the
Superior Court be requested to subpena
witnesses to testify as to the ability of
the parents or guardians of a large num
ber of persons cemmitted to the California
Home for the Care and Training of Fee
ble-Minded Children to pay for the main
tenance of their wards. The resolution
was amended providing that should the
Judges refuse to act a committee of the
board be empowered to take up the In
vestigation.

The steamer Manauense has been char
tered to carry coal from Comox B C
to Skaguay. She will make half a dozen
trips and will be gone from San Fran
cisco for several months. The much

to be one of the handiest vessels on the
coast. "
Commodore Leale. who is in charge of
the great parade scheduled for September
S, will issue a list of assignments to ves
sels the latter part of this week. The
steamer Caroline will go over the course
that all vessels in the parade will follow
and on her will be as many captains as
can get away from their duties. In this
way all the commanders of vessels will
get a good idea of Captain Leale's plans.
The following circular has been sent to
every shipmaster In port:
You are cordially invited to participate
with us, the naval parade committee, in
making the semi-centennial celebration of
the admission of California one of the
grandest in its history.
We -would a"sk that you decorate your
vessel on Saturday evening, September 3,
in the best possible manner, as prizes are
offered as follows: Â¦
For the first best decorated vessel the
sum of $60 and one 20-foot bear flag.
For the second best decorated vessel the
sum of $50 and one 20-foot bear flag. ~
For the third best decorated -vessel the
sum of ?40 and one 20-foot bear flag.
We will furnish you free of cost all the
Japanese lanterns you may desire with
candles for the same. Said lanterns and
candles may be had by applying at th-3
office of the chief wharfinger, foot of Clay
street. Very respectfully,

time the Peru, bound for Central Ameri
can ports, was passing out. All three ves
sels were crowded with passengers.
The China was sent into quarantine,
while the Curacao, after a general In
spection, was allowed to dock. The China
carried 114 cabin passengers, 37 second
cabin and 152 Chinese in the steerage. The
Mongolians were landed on Anpol Island
and after being disinfected will .-be put
back aboard the steamer. The second
cabin passengers will have to remain
aboard until the vessel is released. The
cabin passengers were released late yes
terday afternoon, and it was 8 p. m. be
fore they were landed at the Mall Com
pany's wharf by the steamer Caroline.
Only their hand baggage was released, so
one and all had to go uptown with very
scant supplies for making a toilet. The
majority of those who came on the steam

XETW YOPJC, Aug. 28.â The accumulation of
a ehort Interest during the steady decline,
which had continued for rather more than a
week, offered an opportunity to-day for a turn
by the bulls against the bear interest. The
demand from shorts proved sufficient to check
the declining tendency which was in evidence
In the early dealings and to bring prices back
to about last night's level. There the recovery
stopped and prices dropped again In the final
dealings, making the close heavy and letharglc
The market continued exceedingly narrow and
the volume of dealings fell below yesterday's
2UO.0OO share level. The bulls found material
for their brief turn In the railroad earnings re
ported fcr the day. in a reversal of the discour
aging ter.or of yesterday's rumors regarding
the sugar trade and in the declaration of a
Bemi-annual dividend of 2 per cent on the pre
ferred stock of Chicago, Indianapolis and Louis
ville. The bulls made the most ot the inci
dent and put the preferred stock up 4^ points
and the common 1*;. There was continued
pressure against sugar in the opening dealings,
but the stock rallied lÂ»j on a correction In the
European sugar cables, showing a rise instead
ot a decline in the price of raw sugars. This
was taken to Ehow that American refiners were
again in the market as purchasers of raw
sugar, and to indicate that the season of active
business for refining would extend beyond- the
usual period this year. Kumors were circulat
ed that In consequence the dividend of sugar
would be increased, but the demand for sugar
certificates was satisfied with the covering of
the Fhort interest find the Ftock closed with a
gain of only H- The statement for July of the
Atchison system was also made the most of by
the bulls. Brooklyn Transit advanced on cov
ering, but eased off at the last. The money
market continued to benefit by the redemption

ceipts of gold from the Pacific Coast. Rates
were, not quotably changed.

The i dried fruit : market Is quieter and lacks
the snap of a fortnight ago. There are two
reasons for this. 'Â¦ First, ,. the best grades were
pretty well bought up in the recent lively buy-
Ing and for small and lower grade goods there
Is not so much call: and second, the hot weath
er in the East is affecting the trade there. :
An Increasing demand for Raisins is reported
from New York.
Choice : Honey is firm ' at ' full figures. Nuts
are firm in all positions with a good demand.
A press dispatch from San Jose says that as
the drying of Prunes has now progressed so
far In the Santa Clara Valley that the size
and quality of the crop can . be determined' the
prices will be announced September 1. It has
been a tedious wait for the grower and it is
to be .hoped that - sufficiently remunerative
prices .will . be established to compensate him
for the delay. . .

Supervisor d'Ancona opposed the passage
of the ordinance on the ground that It
was vicious legislation In the Interest of
gambling devices, that should be abol
ished altogether. He said they diverted
money from legitimate channels of trade
and encouraged drinking. Braunhart ex

THE crusade now being waged against

ever, shall not apply to certain places,
where the written consent of the Board
of Police Commissioners has been given
for the conduct or playing of such games,
and shall not affect the playing of any
such game In private family dwellings.
Comte said that the two bills had re
ceived the sanction of the District Attor
ney and the Chief of Police, and were in
tended to stop the evils of public gam
bling. They were referred to the Police
Committee.
The first ordinance follows;
It shall be unlawful for any person to become

place, or any room, apartment or place at
tached to or connected with, forming a part

Â» âÂ¦.-.,
The Supreme Court has rendered a de
cision of interest to miners and pros
pectors. Houston, Mann ; brought an ac
tion against Al Budlong and George Deck
to determine his possessory right to a
quartz mining claim called the Ontario
mine. Budlong and Deck alleged a failure
on the part of Mann to perform the neces
sary amount of work required by law, and
in the lower court they won. It seems
that Mann also owned the Jeanette : claim
on the same lode, which was a continuous
and overlapping claim of the Ontario lo
cation. He drove 5 * several tunnels In the
Jcanette claim for the purpose of devel
oping both properties, and. this work rep
resented* more labor and money than re
quired for both claims.
The lower court found that the work
performed on the Jeanette claim did not
tend to develop the Ontario,, but Â¦Â¦ the Su
preme Court holds otherwise; it says
that the court shall not substitute Its own
judgment and wisdom as to the best
methods of developing the mine In place
of that of the owner. The higher court
holds that the tunneling tended to de
velop both mines, and the cost of the
work being far in excess of what is re
quired by Â¦ law and the work being in
X>rogress at the time of the defendant's
entry It cannot he said that the original
location had been abandoned. The case
comes from San Bernardino County.

BURT WELDON, WHO SPRANG TO DEATH IN THE BAY. 1
OAKLAND. Aug. 2R.â Despondent over
falling to find relief from a physical |
affliction, Burt D. Weldon. a young |
epileptic, committed suicide to-day
by jumping overboard from the narrow
gauge ferry-boat Bay City this afternoon
The body disappeared before the steamer
was stopped and a lifeboat had been low
ered. Young Weldon resided at Seven
teenth avenue and East Twelfth street.
He left his home at noon declaring that
he Intended to end his life. His mother
was so Impressed with his assertion that
when he rushed out of the house she
called neighbors and they started in pur
suit of the desperate youth, but he eluded
them.
Weldon took the 1:16 o'clock train from
Fourteenth and Webster streets. After
he boarded the steamer he conversed a
few minutes with somt acquaintances and
then went to th* 1 restaurant, where he
drank some coffee. Then he went to the
wine room, took a glass of liquor and re
turned to a croup standing near the stern.
AVeldon left behind a bit of paper with
name and address, and then plunged sud
denly over the stern. His body rose once,
but he did nothing to save himself, and
disappeared while the deckhands were
trying to reach him.
Torn out of a notebook was the paper
sheet, which was picked up near where
he jumped. Weldon had written: "This is
my name and addressâ Burt D. Weldon.
335 East Twelfth street. Oakland, Cal. Tel
ephone to Brook 421 and ask them to teh
my mother about me."
For many months young Weldon had
been a sufferer from attacks of epilepsy.
He was under treatment for his affliction.
A short time ago he had been assured that
he was cured, but that fond hope was
crushed a few days ago, when the trouble
recurred. After the attack was over Wel
don became very low-spirited. Before he
left home this morning he tried to borrow
a pistol with which to kill himself. This
action, coupled with his frequent out
bursts of grief over his physical state,
greatly alarmed his parents. As he left
home he declared he would take the nar
row gauge boat and Jump overboard.
Weldon was 22 years old.
MUCH CONFUSION
CONCERNING THE
LAWS OF HAWAII
HONOLULU, Aug. 21.â Flogging as a
prison punishment still remains one of
the rules of Oahu prison, and an agitation
has been started for the elimination of
some of the harsher features of the old
prison laws. It Is claimed by lawyers
that the prison system of the islands is
very defective in that it fails to make
the proper distinctions between petty of
fenders and prisoners who are confined
for serious crimes.
The next Legislature will be asked to
change the rules so these difficulties may
be corrected. It is clulmed that unless
the proper distinctions are made the po
lice or district courts will not be able U>
do business. Under American law crim
inals charged with "infamous" offenses
have a right to Grand Jury indictments.
Hawaiian laws, making all prisoners,
even those in for petty offenses, liable to
hard labor, bring even drunks under this
category. Â¦;â¢ ,\. :â¢Â¦â¢Â¦-
Still another difficulty growing out of
the change of laws was developed yester
day In the district court, where Edwin d.
Gill, editor erf the Republican, was on
trial for criminal libel on account of his
paper's accounts of the recent Bar Asso
ciation banquet. It was contended by the
defense that GUI, unrjer American law,
had a right to both indictment by a Grand
Jury before trial and to a jury trial in the.
first instance. The district court could
not give the latter.
The case was thrown out of court on
the ground that It was the business of
the Grand Jury before it came before a
court.
The discovery has been made that by
the wording of the Territorial bill Con
gress has made an enactment that abso
lutely prohibits the sale of intoxicating
liquors in the Territory of Hawaii. The
enactment was undoubtedly an error, as
the discussions that took place on the
subject show, but it is clearly in the bill
and It seems likely to result, owing to the
fact that there is no penalty, in throwing
the liquor business wide open till the Ter
ritorial Legislature meets. '
In section 55 of the Territorial bill are
the words, "Nor shall Fp!rltuous*or intox
icating liquors be sold except under such
regulations and restrictions as the Terri
torial Legislature shall provide."
The Territorial Legislature has not met
yet and cannot meet for some months un
less there is a special session, hence no
regulations at all have been made or pro
vided. The words of Congress are there
fore Interpreted as meaning that no liquor
shall be sold in the Hawaiian Islands.
The most serious feature of the mistake
if such it is. Is that the words of the or
ganic law of the Islands may act as a re
peal of old Hawaiian laws which provide
for licenses for liquor selling. If the old
rules nnd restrictions are void the penal
ties for violating them fall with thnm.
nnd Hawaii is for the time being a "wide
open" country-
The point was raised by Attorney E. B.
McClanah.in In a suit against the'HolUs
ter Drug Company for selling pure alcohol
under a license for methylated spirits. It
was overruled in the Police Court, but
will be appealed, nnd liquor men under
sentence for violating license laws are
preparing to take advantage of the seem
ing error on the part of the lawmakers.

Grand Marshal Costello received a let
ter from Washington yesterday which as
sures the presence in the parade of a large
detachment of regular troops. The letter
was from the adjutant general, and states
that Major General Shatter has been or
dered by the Secretary of War to turn
out all the troops at his disposal on the
day of the parade. The order gives Gen
eral Shafter authority over troops in tran
sit, which means a far larger representa
tion of regular troops than it would have
been possible to obtain had not this au
thority been given. The grand marshal
will immediately confer with General
Shafter as to the arrangement of details
connected with the regular army display.
The Navy Department has directed the
fullest participation possible by the Iowa
and other naval vessels which may be in
and about this harbor at the time of the
celebration. This order applies to the
naval parade of September 8 and also to
the day parade through the city on Sep

of the county particularly, and it will
represent two mountains. On one of these
mountains four oil derricks In miniature
will be erected, and the whole process of
drilling, pumping and delivering will be
shown. Imitation machinery will be In
actual operation. On the other mountain
will be displayed the manner In which
the Yellow Aster gets out Its gold ore and
reduces it. An exact duplicate of this
wonderful mine and mill, both in runnln?
order, mimicking the desert enterprise,
will be mode. Painted drapery represent

COLONEL WmTTEJJ WEDS.
tary district to be known as the "Cucumls
Sanitary District." Lodi is in Elkhorn
Township, as is Woodbridge. Already the
canvass bad been made and the petition
presented to the Board of Supervisors,
and It was expected that a call for a vote
on the question would be Issued by the
board for next month. Bitter feeling was
aroused between the sanitary people and
those favoring the saloons, one anti-sa
loon man alone spending $500 for his cause.
The anti-saloon followers held a big
meeting last night tn the Christian
church, every church in town Joining the
assembly. Rev. W. H. Scudder addressed
the throng, but instead of a hot temper
ance speech he rather scourged the church
people for their treatment of the young
and old. whom they proposed to save from
saloon temptation. "Have you any place
a young man can go into at night except
the saloon?" he asked. "Have you any
place open to the young men of your
town? Have you a reading room, a hall.
a gymnasium or any place where they can
meet? There is no place open to them
but the saloon. Why don't you, In lhe
name of God. why don't you concentrato
the efforts of your churches to giving the>
young man a chance? By opening such a
place I believe you could almost run the
saloon out of town by that alone. I be
lieve in practical religion, but it is a won
der what a mighty little bit of practical
religion some of us have. How many
rights In the week Is this church open'.'
Wnat attractions do you offer the young
people? Here Is j-our opportunity. Do
the practical thing. Open places where
your boys can so. Don't damn the Â«ialoon
keepers but yourselves for not offering 1
your boy9 attractions elsewhere."
The gentleman's speech made a pro
found stir, though, as might be expected,
not all his hearers took kindly to it. Xt
has been the main topic on the streets
to-day, and it Is expected that the ar.tl
saloon people will take the new Idea and
give it a trial.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
LODI, Aug. 23.â After fifteen months of;
hard, unremitting labor and the expendi
ture of a large amount of money the local
Anti-Saloon League people have been

RED MEN WHO ARE HELPING
TO PREPARE FEATURE FOR THE
PARADE.
Frank Sutton does not seem to realize
that he did anything unusual in his brave
stand against the fire of the burglars. Ha
told his story thia evening in a quiet,
modest fashion.
"When the men started to run." said
young Sutton. "I called to them 'Hands
up!' It was at thl3 time that one of them
turned and shot at me. They had evi
dently heard my rifle click, for Just before
the short man shot the other said. 'He's
got a gun sure, shoot.' Their second shot
and my rifle snot were almost simultan
eous. I heard their bullet whiz by close
to my head. I wasn't frightened at the
time, although I was pretty weak after It
was all over with."
"1 think Frank deserves a great deal of
credit," said Mr. Sutton, the lad's father.
"When I rushed into his room he was
still at the window and perfectly cool.
There was a light back of him in the hall
way which shown through his room, mak
ing him a perfect target to the men be
low."
Town Marshal Lloyd, who Is investigat
ing the affair, is puzzled over the circum
stances. He believes it to be peculiar that
a burglar not cornered should use a. re
volver.
This was the second attempt to burs
larlze the Sutton house recently. About
a week ago someone attempted to enter
the dwelling by the kitchen window, but
was frightened away.
This morning a chisel, evidently intend
ed for a Jimmy, a skeleton key, a candle,
partly burned, and a bit were found near
the cellar door where the men had lefi
them in their flight.
Young Sutton Is the son of A. M. Sut
ton. a commission merchant of San Fran
cisco, who resides at the corner of Dwighi
way and Piedmont avenue, this city.
Shortly after 2 o'clock Â»hia morning the
boy was awakened by a noise and look-
Ing from his window in the second story
he could distinguish two men busy <n au
attempt to force the cellar door. He got
his rifle and commenced loading it. A:
the same time he leaned out of the win
dow and demanded, "Who's there?" The
burglars started to run and one of them
hearing the click of the rifle said to his
comrade. "He's got a gun. sure, shoot."
The short burglar turned and fired twico
with his revolver at the boy in the win
dow. Young Sutton did not shrink froni
his position, but promptly returned the
fire. The burglars dodged behind an arbor
leading to the barn and made their escapu
by scaling the rear fence. Sutton was not
injured and he says he is quite certain
that his aim was true.
BERKELEY. Aug. 2S.â A duel took
place at Dwijrht way in the darkness
early this morning 1 between a seventeen
year-old boy and two burglarsâ the pro
verbial long and short criminals. Frank
Sutton, the boy. was armed with a Win
chester repeating rifle, while the burglars
carried revolvers.

Charge of Assault to Murder Against
Her Is Dismissed by Judge
Conlan.
As was anticipated, "Billy" Abbott has
refused to prosecute Polly Knight, alias
Rene Adams, the young laundry girl who
shot him last Saturday morning because
ho had ruined and discarded her, and the
case of assault to murder against her was
dismissed yesterday by Judge Conlan.
When the case was called Policeman
Nelson was put on the stand. In answer
to questions he said he had seen Abbott
In the rooms above his "dive" at 416 Du
pont street Monday night and Abbott had
told him that he would positively refuse
to prosecute the girl.
"I move that the case be dismissed,"
said Assistant District Attorney Weller.
.."This case," said the Judge, "resembles
that of Kitty Turner, who stabbed a mem
ber of the same class of men recently. To
dismiss the case is the only proper dispo
sition to make of it, and it is to be regret
ted that In neither instance was the
wound fatal."
The girl left the courtroom with her at
torney, ex-Judge Graham, and was con
gratulated by several friends who were
waiting for her in the corridor.

WIDOW OF MEANS
COMMITS SUICIDE
Mrs. Louisa Borelie of San Rafael
Kills Herself in Leona Hotel,
Alameda.
JpP JLAMEDA. Aug. 28.â With her plan*
// \\ perfected for a deliberate Buicido by
h gas asphyxiation, a becomingly
dressed woman of about 40 years
called at the Leona Hotel. 1G43 Park
street, at a late hour last night and en
gaged a lodging for the night. That the
unfortunate's scheme for self-destruction
did not miscarry was evident this after
noon, when the police burst open the
door of her room and discovered her life
less body lying across the bed. The re
mains were identified to-night as those of
Mrs. Louisa Borelle, a well-to-do widow
of San Rafael.
In the woman's room aXter it had been
broken into by the police there was abun
dant evidence of a well-laid plan by
which she intended to end her troubles.
The cracks of the only door and the only
Â¦window had been tightly stuffed with cot
ton. Even the keyhole was so tightly
sealed that the key could not be Inserted
by the landlady when Fhe tried to locate
the escaping gas. Both jets were turned
on full and the small room was filled with
the gas. Near the body was found a coil
of rubber tubing which had not been
used, though It was evident that the
woman intended to attach it to the Jet
and inhale the gas. An empty bottle
which had contained chloroform was
among- the effects in the room, but ac
cording to Dr. C. L. Tiedale, who exam
ined the body, the unfortunate had not
taken any of the poison.
The woman wore an 18-karat plain gold
ring on the small finger of her left hand,
there being no initialing on It- In the
room wore found a cheap purse containing
$4 â¬0. a bottle of beef extract and a bottle
containing an iron tonic.
Mrs. Borelle "was a widow and had three
small children. She had a sister living In
Alameda, Mrs. Joseph Didicr of 2306
Clement avenue.
WIDOW, WHO, DESPONDENT
OVER HUBBAND'S DEATH,
TURNED ON THE GAS.
Mrs. Borelle came from France with her
husband about ten Â¦ years ago. About a
year ago her husband died, and since his
taking off she had been subject to fits of
despondency. . She was residing with a
Mrs. Lovell, who lives on Ross street.
San Rafael. She was known to have con
fiderable property, which was left her by
her husband. About a week ago she came
to Alameda to visit her ' sister.
Young Russell; Lowry,. who gained noto
riety some time ago through his marriage
to Miss Anita Lucky George concert hall

He was released on $300 cash bail. .
Russell Lowry Arrested.
5O weak that he could not steady
himself unaided, his emaciated faco
a picture of mental torture, his
hands quivering under the tre
mendous nervous strain. J. E. King, sus
pected murderer of S. II. Church, a plo
r.eer rancher of Two Rock Valley, Marln
County, teas brought to this city last night
and placed in the City Prison.' King was
raptured near Orland at an early hour
yesterday morxing. His captors were
Deputy Sheriff M. H. Goe of Butte Coun
ty, Constable J. G. Clark of Glenn County
and John Thomas. The former two came
direct to this city with their prisoner.
From here he will be taken to San Rafael
this morning at 9 o'clock.
Finally the searchers returned, footsore
and discouraged. "He * is dead some
where," they said, and many were content
to let the matter rest with that as the
The arrest of King brings to a close one
of the most remarkable man hunts ever
held In California. For more than a
month the desperate man baffled the keen
est Sheriffs and ' Constables in five coun
ties. Again and again the officers would
come upon his trail, only to lose it just
when capture seemed most certain. The
Governor of California offered a reward
of $300 for King's capture, and the family
of the murdered rancher Increased the
sum to $500. Men from all sections of the
State joined in the search, and for days
and weeks the mountains, hills and dales
were traversed.
Constables Get First Clew;
'- "I decided- to lose i no time In: running
down Miller's story,: and, accompanied by
"He told me that King was located near
Orland and that I should start for there
at once. He advised me not to go alone,
as ' he understood the - murderer - was
armed. He was sure the man whom he
suspected was King from the description
given him by the man whom he had left
in -- charge - of - his house. Miller said he
had been away, and upon returning yes
terday was told â¢ by his hired man of a
stranger's visit to the ranch:? He Inquired
for Mr. Miller ! and seemed --'I anxious to
know just Â¦, when he. was expected ; back. Â¦
Constable J. G. Clark was attending the
funeral of his wife. "I had been bothered
so many times by people who thought
they had a clew to King's "whereabouts,"
said the constable In relating the story of
King's capture last evening, "that when a
man nudged me on the shoulder? during
the progress of the services and asked me
to step outside a moment I felt like telling
him to get out and leave me alone. ': On
second thought I answered the summons
and found 'Billy' Miller, who resides
near Orland, waiting. He had driven all
the way over purposely, to see me. Â¦-/-'-
Betrayed by Sis Cousin.
The day after the murder Marln County
was in a state of excitement. The people
of Two Rock Valley were especially In
censed because they knew the old rancher
so well. Church had long been a resident
of the valley and had done much to make
the little settlement thrive and prosper.
. The news of his murder spread rapidly
and was quickly followed by the forma
tion of searching nartles. Men left their
work to Join in the man hunt, and several
times it seemed as if their efforts to run
down the fugitive would be successful. He
was tracked as far as Trinity Center, and
then all trail was lost.
Not until last Monday afternoon did- the
sheriffs get any positive clew regarding
King's whereabouts, and that came from
a most unexpected source.
Search for Murderer Begins.
There was a well at one end of Mr.
Church's property which was unused by
the family. King proceeded to make use
of it for watering his horses. He was
warned by Church to keep away, but the
order was Ignored. When on a second
occasion Church discovered the horses at
the well he became more violent in hi*
orders to King to "clear out." Hot words
followed on the part of both men, and the
tilt culminated in King pulling his gun on
the rancher. Church died almost instant
ly. King coolly Jumped into his wagon
and drove away. Nothing was seen or
heard of him from that time until his ar
rest yesterday morning. Â¦
ICIng is charged with having shot and
killed, Rancher S. H. Church at Two Rock
Valley on July 23. King is a piano tuner
and cleaner and he traveled through the
country towns with his wife, stopping at
the ranches and farmhouses and tuning
pianos for money or in exchange for live
stock. The couple would camp on the out
skirts of a town, feeding their horses In
near-by pastures and watering them at
some rancher's well. Â¦ Â¦
best solution of the mystery- There were
a few who refused to give up the hunt,
among them Constable Clark of Glenn
County. He was attending the funeral of
his wife yesterday afternoon, j when a
friend called him aside and Â¦ whispered
that King, the suspect, was not seventeen
miles away. Immediately after the ser
vices the constable started in search of
the alleged murderer, and twelve hours
later he had him en route for San Fran
cisco, i
King's, Awful Crime.
rCHER CHURCH'S MURDERER AND THE TWO MEN WHO CAPTURED HIM..
"Billy" Miller had informed the Con
stable that King, the murderer, was In
the vicinity of his home and it was this
that brought about the capture.
Jameson, or King, as soon as he was
placed in a cell, rolled himself in a blanket
and was soon fast asleep. When he was
brought out for further interview he de
clared that he was workout and in need
of rest. No amount of coaxing could get
him to make any further statement.
The prisoner claims that the man who is
wanted is his second cousin to whom lie
has been told he bears a great resem
blance.
Denies He Is the Murderer.
â¢ When he arrived at Orland, his cousin's
home, he learned that Miller was away at
Bartlett Springs. -King then went farther
looking for work. About seventeen miles
out of Orland he secured employment
herding turkeys from' a rancher named
Liebeck. iHIs employer left - the ranch
with his wife to attend a trial at Red
Bluff and King was left In charge.
When asked his name he declared it
was J. W. Jameson. Clark insisted it was
J. E. King and the prisoner's name was
entered with the latter as an alias. He
gave his age as 30 years and his occupa
tion as that of a knife grinder.
King claims he -was in California twen
ty-five years ago with his mother, since
deceased, on a visit to her relatives, the
Kings. After his mother's death he felt
a desire to return to this State to see his
kinfolks. He had had an uneventful life
and had not put aside any money, bo hi3
Journey here was made partly by rail and
at times on foot. â¢ â¢
The officers had considerable difficulty
In removing the handcuffs from him and
during the operation King complained of
being worn out and was anxious to get to
sleep.
Upon reaching this city the constables
and their prisoner boarded a McAllister
street car and went direct to the City
Prison, where King was booked en route
to San Rafael. King was dressed in faded
blue overalls and Jumper and carried his
few belongings in a sack thrown over his
shoulder. . c-v;V>i--v..
Taken to City Prison.
The officers reached Orland at noon yes
terday. They left there at once for this
city, arriving about 9 o'clock last night.
King will be taken to San Rafael this
morning, where he will be arraigned on
the charge of murder.
The officers took the prisoner before Mr.
Miller,' the man who had given them the
information of his whereabouts. Miller
at once recognized King as his second
cousin. He called the prisoner cousin,
and King replied:
"I don't know you. My name is Jame
son."
"Oh, no it isn't, it's Bd King, and you
are my cousin," replied Milier.
The prisoner then made this significant
remark: "Well, you ought to know me,
then."
King's Significant Remark.
"Theij we asked him if we could water
our horse before resuming our journey.
He replied that we could and walked
ahead of us to draw up some water from
the well. While he leaned over Mr. Goe'
Jumped out of the carriage and grabbed
King before he had time to raise his gun.
"We told him he was under arrest, and
he wanted to know the charge. 'You will
find out later,' I answered. On 'the way
back he was quiet and did not seem to
care where he was going. He tried to get
us to tell him on what charge he was ar
rested. We asked him if his name was
not King, and he replied in the- negative.
'Jameson is my name,' and Jameson he
has stuck to clear to San Francisco."
Well, we have some, but I am not
sure that Mr. Lieback wants to sell
them.'
"'No, I am not,' was his reply. 'Mr.
Liebeck has gone away for a day or two.'
"â¢Have you any turkeys to sell?' Mr.
Goe asked.
â¢We had traveled about seventeen miles
out of Orland when we reached a ranch
run by a man named Liebeck. As we
neared the house we saw another man in
the doorway. Whether he suspected that
we were officers or not it is hard to tell,
but we saw him go back into the house
and when he returned, as we entered the
driveway, he had a shotgun in his hand.
â¢' 'Are you Mr. Liebeck'.'' I asked calm
ly, not wishing to have him suspect we
were constables.
Caught Unawares.
"Grinding razors and scissors was his
trade now, and if the people we visited
told us the truth he must have fared
pretty well, as he was given a lot of work
tO do. Â¦ -
Deputy Sheriff Goe and John Thomas,
both of whom were attending the funeral,
we started for Orland. On the way we
stopped at a number of ranches and
learned that a man answering King's de
scription had been in that neighborhood
last week. At about every place we
stopped the description of King's face was
the same, but each had a different story
to tell regarding his clothes. We made
up our minds that our man was changing
his wearing apparel about three times a
day.
