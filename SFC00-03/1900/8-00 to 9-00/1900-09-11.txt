PARTIAL LIST OF THE
VICTIMS OF DISASTER
with unabated fury and the roar of the!
wind was accompanied by the sound of
craÂ«=hinsr glass as one after another many
Windows were torn from their fastenings
and shattered upon the sidewalk below.
Sortlon after section of the tin roof was
roiu-d up like sheets of parchment and
hurled hundreds of feet away. To add to
th-> terror and confusion the electric light?
suddenly went out and the building was
left In total darkness. The roof of the
Grand Central Hotel was torn off, many
of its inmates rushing into the street.
Almost simultaneously a wail went up
from the people In the Lawler House, as
the big skylifrht on the top broke loose
and fell trashing down the shaft.
"Soon above the roar of the wind and
the crashing of glass was ho;Â»r<l the sound
of tailing brlrk. Every one realized the
prnvlty of the situation, but no one made
a sound. There was no shrieking, no
faint ins. Many women were there and
they stood the ordeal with such fortitude
ns to lend courage to pvien the faintest
hearted man. Suddenly the sound ceased
and the lower story of the depot, whore
all had again refuge, remained intact.
An inspection in the morning, however,
revealed the fact that it was badly shaken
and greatly damaged.
"As my train left Houston after day
light, nine hours late, nothing had been
learned as to tho havoc of the storm in
other parts of the city. Along the road
north of Houston scenes of devastation
and distress were witnessed. Buildings
had been torn down and the material of
which they were built was scattered over
the ground for miles. Trees had been
pul ed up by their roots and denuded of
their branches. Fields that had been
smiling the day before with all the great
fertility of this record-breaking year
were bare, tho plants having been grasped
by the hurricane and scattered far and
wide Hundreds of head of cattle and
been killed. They enn be no question that
the lops of life had been something ap
palling. At least 40 per cent of the
structures in the towns of Ilockley, Cy
press and Waller have been totally de
stoyed. Hearne was damaged somewhat,
but I do not regard the situation there
comparatively speaking, as serious."

OE LIFE AT FROM 15OO TO 5OOO
AUSTIN. Tex.. Sept. 10.â When asked to-night by a representative of the Associated Press for an expression as to the
f.r.od fituation along the gulf coast. Governor Savers said: "I think it la the. most deplorable catastrophe in the
hiFtory of America, and I feel that every possible aÂ»l should be lent tlio sufferers in their hour of great need. From
information received here I am led to think .that hundreds of families have cither lost their dear onos or been be
reft of thr-ir homes, and the case is one that will certainly appeal to every one. I havt- taken active steps to raise
relief for every one that can possibly be looked after. I have wired to all tho City Mayors and the County Judges
asking them u> secure aJl funds and provisions possible, and their replies to-night are very gratifying: The assistance
lent us by thr- Federal Government in the way of 50.000 rations and IOxi tents will add not "a little in aiding the situation
at pr'Ffv.t. Tho f, r pt duty, of course, will be to look after the living, thus.- thirstinp nr hungry, without Hthor water or
palatable food to out; but I think within a day or two wr- will have the relief corps working in good order. I will give
the matter my personal supervision and am conn-lent that we will sc-o to it that everybody Is looked after It will re
quire considerable money, however, to do all this. I have located several assistants and the Adjutant General is near
the scene of action, and they will ixrsonaJIy supervise the distribution. whilÂ«> I remain here to answer all Inquiries."
"Such a night of agony has seldom been equaled. Without apparent reason
the water beean to subside at 1:45 a. m. Within two minutes it had gone
down two feet and before da'ylight the streets were practically freed of the
flood waters. In the meantime the wind had veered to the southeast. Very few
if any buildings escaped injury. There is hardly a habitable dry house in the
city. When the people who had escaped death went out at daylight to view
the work of the tempest and the floods they saw the. most horrible sight im
aginable. In the three blocks from avenue N to avenue P, on Tremont street. I
saw eight bodies. Four corpses were In one yard.
"Tht- whole of the business front for three blocks in from the gulf was
stripped of every vestige of habitation, the dwellings, the great bathing estab
lishments, the Olympla and every structure having been either carried out to
sea or Its ruins piled In a pyramid far into the town, according to the vagaries
of the tempest. *
FEW BUILDINGS ESCAPE INJURY.
"About noon It became evident that the city was going to be visited with
disaster. Hundreds of residences along the beach front were hurriedly aban
doned, the families fleeing to dwellings In higher portions of the city. Every
home was opened to the refugees, black or white. The wind was rising con
stantly and rain fell in torrents. The wind was so fierce that the rain cut like a
knife. By 3 o'clock the waters of the gulf and bay met and by dark the entire
city was submerged. The flooding of the electric light plant and the gas planis
left the city In darkness. To go out Into the streets was to court death. The
wind was then at cyclonic velocity. Roofs, cisterns, portions of buildings, tele
graph poles and walls were falling and the noise of the wind and the crashing
of the buildings was terrifying In the extreme. The wind and waters rose stead
ily from dark until "1:45 o'clock Sunday morning. During all this time the people
of Galveston were like rats In traps. The highest portion of the city was four
to five feet under water, while in the great majority of ease.* the streets were
submerged to a depth of ten feet. To'leave a house was to drown. To remain
was to court death in the wreckage. . . , \
HUNDREDS OF RESIDENCES ABANDONED.
gHUijujyjIHl m.i*jjm Ot'STON, Texas, Sept. 10. â Richard Splllane, a well-known
j2j ffi Â¦ Galveston newspapvr man and day correspondent' of the As
* BcSXKlSS;* j seriated Press In that city, who reached Houston to-day
I J^! after a terrible experience, gives the following account of the
BfiMMa ' HrlWWWM disaster at Galveaion':
"One of the most awful tragedies of modern times has visited Galveston?
The city is in ruins and the dead will probably number a thousand. I am just
from the city, having been commissioned by the Mayor and citizens' committee to
get In touch with the outside world and appeal for help. Houston was the near
est point at which working telegraph instruments could be found, the vÂ»lres as
well as nearly all the buildings between here and the Gulf of Mexico being
wrecked.
"When I left Galveston shortly before noon yesterday the people were or
ganizing for the prompt burial of the dead, distribution of food and all the nec
essary work ofter a period of disaster. The wreck of Galve&ton was brought
about by a tempest so terrlDlo that no words can adequately describe Its intensity
and by a flood which turned .e city Into a raging sea. The Weather Bureau
records show that the wind attained a velocity of eighty-four miles an hour
when the measuring instrument blew away, so It is impossible to tell what the
maximum was.
"The storm began about 2 o'clock Saturday morning. Previous .to that a
great storm had been raging in the gulf and the tide was very high. The wind
at first came from the north and was in direct opposition to the force from the
gulf. While the storm in the gulf piled the water upon the beach side of the
city the north wind piled the water from the bay on the bay part of the city.

VIEWS IX GALVESTON AND MAP SKOTVIXG THE LOCATION' OP
THE CITY ON THE ISLAND, AT THE MOUTH OF THE BAY.
Galveston stands on the eastern end of a low, narrow, sandy island thirty
mllrs Ions, which .has been built up by surf and marine currents as a sort of
bre.-ikwatcr at the mouth of Galveston Bay. which is an inlet of the (Julf of
Mexico, thirty-flvo miles Ions and fifteen wide, with about sixteen feet of
water normally on the bar. The Island is not over throe fe^t above the sea
level on the average and nowhere over eight feet highland inundations from
both the sea and bay have occurred several times before, though happiiy
with little loss of life or property. A strong 1 wind either from the east or
northwest drives the water up into the streets, which, fronv the nature of
the place, are not much elevated. Two viaducts some three miles Ions carry
railroads which connect the Island city with the continental systems. Gal
veston In 1S0O had a population of about 30,000, which has Increased since to
some 3S.0O0.
MOST DEPLORABLE CATASTROPHE
IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICA
WASHINGTON. D. C. Sept. IO. â Miss Clara Barton to-night issued the following appeal in bahalf
of the Texas sufferers:
"The National Bed Cross at Washington, Df C, is appealed to on all sides for help and
for the privileg-e to help in the terrible disaster which has befallen Southern and Central Texas. It re
members the floods of Ohio and Mississippi, of Johnstown and of Port R-cyal, with their thousands of
dead and months of suffering and needed relief, and turns confidently to the people of the United
States, whoss sympathy has never failed to help provide the relief that is asked of it now/Nineteen years
)f experience on nearly as many fields renders the obligations of the Red Cross all the greater. The peo
ple have long learned its vrorth and it must again open its accustomed avenues for their charities. It
does not beseech to give, for their sympathies are as deep and their humanity as great as its own, but
it pledges them faithful, old-time Red Cross relief work among the stricken victims of these terrible
fields of suffering and death. He gives twice who gives quickly. Contributions may be wired or sent
by mail to our treasurer, William J. Flather, assistant cashier Riggs National Bank, Washington, D. C.J
also to the local Red Cross committees of the Red Cross India famine fund at 156 Fifth avenue, New
York City, and the Louisiana Red Cross Society of New Orleans, bath of whom will report all dona
tions for immediate acknowledgment by us. CLARA BARTON,
President American National Red Cross.
RED CROSS WORKERS
TO HELP AFFLICTED
Governor Savers appealed to President McKinley for aid. This appeal was met by a
prompt response from the President, who stated that 1000 tents and 50,000 rations had been or
dered to Galveston. Governor Savers also addressed an appeal to each municipality in the State
asking- for prompt assistance in caring for the sufferers.
Telegrams of inquiry and help have been pouring in throughout the day and night from
every State in the Union and in almost every instance substantial relief has been offered.
The stricken city is in imminent danger of a water famine and strenuous efforts are being
made here to supply the sufferer?. Relief trains are being organized and will leave here at an early
hour to-morrow.
Reports from the interior confirm the loss of life and destruction .of property reported in
these dispatches last night.
The burial of the dead has already begun. The list of the dead as given to the Associated
Press to-night by the Galveston News is only a partial one and the names of all who perished in
Saturday's great storm will never be known.
At the army barracks near San Antonio a report is current that more than 100 United
States soldiers lost their lives in Galveston. The report, however, lacks confirmation.
To-day a mass-meeting was held and liberal contributions were made for the immediate re
lief of the destitute.
I 'in^-HHl Mlfc/m OUSTOX, Tex., Sept. io. â The first reports from the appalling;: disaster which

SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDA^, SEPTEMBER 11, 1900.
Continued on Fifth Pajr*.
The San Francisco Call.THERE has been no better parade
seen in San Francisco than that
which trod the streets yesterday.
It was long and It was new and
good, and there was a tremendous
crowd to cheer It on its way.
FIRST.
SOLDIERS and sailors, regular and
militia, headed by the band of the old
First California A'olunteers, made up
the First Division. The band dressed in
khaki uniforms and campaign hats,
brought memories of the days when the
regiment suiled away and when it re
turned, and the cheers that greeted It
had more than the sound of voices in
them. The division was made up of the
regular soldiers from the Presidio, the
regular sailors from the Pensacola and
Iowa, the Governor and his staff, Major
General Shafter and his staff, Major Gen
eral Dickinson and his staff, Rear Ad
miral Kautz and his staff and the Second
Brigade. N. G. C. and the naval militia
of California, It was an imposing dis
play.
SECOND.
THE second division, led by Marshal
George H. Pippy, swung into line im
mediately behind the carriages which
contained Mayor Phelan and the mu
nicipal officers. Their leader, mounted on
a superb black horse anil attired in mili
tary uniform, made a striking figure.
Colonel Pippy and his aids. Colonel A. S.
Hubbard and F. Rust, gathered thfir
forces together in true military style and
when the carriages had passed Steuart
street the division swung into line with
out a break. The division was made up
of civic and military societies and made a
splendid appearance.
The San Francisco Schuetzen Verein. In
command of Captain J. Thode, marched
to the stirring strains or Prep's concert
band. The members of the German or
ganization won approval all along the
line of march for their soldierly bearing
and handsome uniforms. They were at
tired in gray suits and on their breasts
glittered myriads of medals won at the
rifle butts. There were more than 200 in
line. Following In their wake was Blum's
band, which discoursed enlivening music
for the Marshall Society of California
Pioneers. At the head of the musicians
was Colonel Dixie Thompson and his (am.
ous horse. The famous Southern Califor
nian millionaire was mounted on a steed
which was caparisoned in a manner which
would befit a monarch of any kingdom.
The horse was groomed until his silken
coat shone with luster and made a beau
tiful background for tne costly silver
trappings. Even its. dancing hoofs were
plated with silver in harmony with the
shining saddle and bridle. Colonel
Thompson made a striking figure and
was vigorously applauded. His magnifi
cent steed seemed to appreciate that It
was on parade and pirouetted with the
grace of a coryphee. For blocks Its rider
other Native Sons who fought in the Phil
ippines were in the van. The First Reg
iment band was received all along the
line with cheers, as were also the First
Regiment, N. G. C, and the Army and
Navy Parlor.
The bursting of bombs and shrieking of
whistles marked the start of the parade.
The myriads of people caught the Infec
tion and cheered until voices were hoarse
and throats were sore and flags and
handkerchiefs fluttered from every side In
enthusiastic greeting to tie men in line.
The parade swung into Montgomery
street and up Montgomery avenue to
Kearny street and then back to" Market,
while the crowd farther up waited ex
pectantly.
As the head of the line emerged again
into Market street the thousands gathered
at that center sent up a welcoming shout
that grew to tremendous volume.
For nearly an hour the spectators there
saw swinging !nto the main thoroughfare
body after body of troops until there
seerm" nothing but soldier? and sailors.
Red plumed artillerymen sat on their
horses or perched on caissons with the
ease of the regulars. Clean limbed
marines and sturdy Jack Tars from the
Iowa and the Philadelphia swung along
In the wake of the clattering artillery and
down the street behind them sounded thiÂ» i
hoofbeats of cavalry horses. Three regi
ments of infantry, a battalion of cadets
from the University, the popular naval
malitia with a strong stride and perfc.et
alignment that evoked cheers all along
the line of march, followed the regulars..
Bugle calls and the hoarse shouted orders
of officers rose above the tramp of men
and horses. The war spirit seemed to be
abroad again, and General Shatter in his
carriage was given an ovation while civic
officers of State and city were ailowed to
pass almost unnoticed.
With the second division came a change
in the character of the parade. Pioneers
who were here before California was a
baby were followed by Mexican veterans
who fought a dozen battles. Exempt fire
men, who once guarded the cradle of the
Infant California, marched in line with
astonishing vigor: only a few were com
pelled by Infirmity to ride in carriages.
Another turn of the kaleidoscope and
there were set on the smooth surface of
the street bright groups of school child
ren, a boys' brigade and a girls' brigade.
More veteran firemen followed, as if to
make the contrasts as strong as possible.
and infantry regiments marched to their
!T is a great thing to belong to the
sisterhood of States and to have
rounded a half century. For that
2T..000 sturdy sons of California
marched in parade yesterday in
bright uniforms and with banners
afluttc r. while 250.090 of her loyal people
thronged the line of march, eager to see
the gay pageant, the glorious tribute to
the fairest of States, prepared by the
bravest of sons.
Prom 10 until 3 o'clock the stream of
soldiery. Native Rons' parlors, floats, car
riages with dignitaries and fraternal so
cieties moved steadily along, marching
eivI countermarching, while the vast as-
Femhlage of spectators clung to points of
vantage, not willing to miss seeing even
the ragged end of the miles-long line of
marching men.
The occasion was great and the
demonstration was worthy of it.
Never before in her history has San
Francisco had within its limits so many
people, and of all the residents and visit
ing thousands few Indeed failed to see the
parade in its entirety. California has
reached her semi-centennial, and the
crownine fraturo of the great celebration
In honor of the event so far surpassed
any pageant ever (rtUiessed in San Fran
daoo that comparison with former ones
give* no conception of the maRnitudc of
this.
San Francisco got t:p early yesterday
morning, and hours before the" time get
for the parade to start ix?op!e were crowd
ing toward Market street. At 'j o'clock
they bepan to take up positions from
which the parade could be seen to advan
tage. Hurrying through the crowd were
Native Sons in the uniform of their par
lors, hastening toward the appointed
meeting place to form for the parade.
Clad in white duck or wearing broad som
breros, gorgeous .-ashes or the regalia of
the order, they gave presage of the spec
tacle that was preparing.
Soon parlors in marching formation br
fan to appear along the Ei<3e streets and
thread their way toward tlio water front
to take the places assigned to them. Jia"
rlnes and sailors from the Philadelphia
and the Iowa came ashore anÂ«l tramped
elong East street with the sturdy swing
that makes the American regulars,
whether liolOiers or sailors, seem Irresist
ible. Batteries of artillery from the Pre
sidio, yellow-plumed cavalry of the Na
tional <Juard, sailors of the Naval Militia
places on East street in rapid succession
and in numbers to make it seem that the
parade was to be one of the military
alone. But neatly uniformed Native Sons'
parlors, floats carrying bevies of Native
Daughters in fleecy white dresses and
Red Men in costume were to be seen
down the vista of every side street.
As the hour of 10 approached the throng
augmented with startling rapidity. Along
the wire ropes stretched by the police to
keep the streets in the line of march
clear the populace gathered a dozen deep.
At each cros3 street the line of people
knotted into a mass that practically
stopped progress in any direction. Faces
began to show at windows and men,
women and children appeared on roofs,
took their places on window ledges and
scrambled to choice seats on fire escapes
and the iron girders of unfinished build
ings. Long before the time for the pa
rade lo start buildings along Market,
Montgomery and Kearny streets showed
pjrti-eblored groups at every window and
the people on roofs and ledgc-s clustered
as thick as flics. Far back from the line
of march, on roofs and at windows half
a block away, wherever a view of a por
tion of rope-guarded street could be had,
there spectators gathered.
The morning was cool and the crowd
Tvaiteil patiently and li: pood humor for
the pageant that was to make its holiday.
There was jostling, plenty of It, but the
crowd displayed only the good-natured
carnival spirit of "take what comes."
Shortly before 10 o'clock a hush of ex
pectancy fell on the throng. It was as if
the crowded city held its breath. On
Kast street. Just south of Market, Grand
Marshal Costello sat on his black charger,
a hundred resplendent aids about him. At
the time set, to a minute, the roar of a
bursting bomb gave signal, the grand
marshal raised his baton, a bugler sound
ed "attention" and "forward, -march!"
The First Regiment band, clad in the
khaki suits of their Philippine campaign,
took up the strains of a spirited march
and the parade was on.
The start was good, but the parade
moved fifty feet and was blocked by a
regiment of militia marching down Mar
ket street, late to place. The delay was
short, however, and once under way there
were very few tiresome stops. The pro
cession for the most part moved steadily
on. showing an ever-changing view to
tho spectators.

PROUD PARADERS MARCH TO MUSIC
attired In their red shirt*, black helmet*
and dark trousers and presented a smart
appearance. As they marched they held
a long rope which was attached to a small
handpower machine, which was built in
New York in 1820 and which was usei
with great success in the early days of
California statehood. A bu?hy fox tail
pointing skyward was secured to the han
dle of the fire extinguisher and the Ini
tiated smiled Inwardly and commented on
the wild races to fires in the early days
to win the precious trophy. An old hose
cart was drawn through the streets by
sons of the veterans and Immediately
behind them came the handsome Exempt
engine called the double-decker, drawn by
four powerful white horses. A number
of carriages containing disabled members
of the old and the new Fire Departments
were next in line and. then came the San j
Francisco Department's turnout. First
came about fifty members of the depart
ment, headed by Second Assistant Crne-
P. H. Shaughnessy. The men were dressed
in their neat blue uniforms and caps and
marched with all the pride that they feel
in being members of one of the best de
partments in the world. Close behind
them in carriages were Fire Commission,

the band were more than a hundred car
riages containing Pioneers of California.
The venerable survivors of the historic
occasion when California was admitted
into the Union gazed with pleasure at the
grand celebration of the anniversary of
the birth of a State of which they were
the founders. As the carriages which
bore the gray-haired men through the
crowded thoroughfares moved In stately
procession the spectators cheered the
Pioneers to the echo. Each vehicle con
tained four members of the society and
was decorated with bear and national
flags.
Veterans of the Mexican War were also
in carriages, but their fast thinning ranks
were feebly represented. Captain Jack
Crawford, the poet scout and former
chef of scouts in the United States array
led the immigrant train with its attend
ant scouts and packers and pack mules.
This part of the division was a pleasing
feature of the parade. The red shirts of
the scouts and packers, the easy manner
in which they rode their cayuses and

the line who cheered them as they passed
orbantertd them good naturedly, and the
"fat boys" and "Bills" and "Toms" were
butts for many a witty shaft.
Of all the parlors,. Ramona No. 109 of
Los Angeles attracted most attention.
They wore the dress of the early Spanish
settlers, -with handsome sombreros, and
were mounted. Fresno Parlor No. 23 also
wore sombreros. The red coats, white
braided, of Piedmont Parlor, lent brilliant
color to that division, as did also the yel
low lapels of the black coats of Stockton
Parlor No. 7. Halcyon Parlor No. 14G had
one of the neatest uniforms seen in ths
parade.
The various parlors of Native Daughters
were greeted with cheers throughout the
march. The white dresses of the members
of La Estrella Parlor and the snowy
whiteness of their emblem made one of
the prettiest pictures of the pageant.
The parade was so long that people
grew tired and ill humored and then got
over It and again entered Into the spirit
of. the occasion before it passed. It is
estimated that 25,0*30 persons were in line.
Three hours and a half were required lo

people that gave striking proof of the Im

PARADE DIVISIONS
AS THEY PASSED
2The section occupied by Bakersllold No.
42 was one of the most interesting in the
parade. The float represented quartz min
ing with all the requisite machinery and
was cleverly constructed by several of
the members. Two little live bears and a
goat attached to a tiny wagon concluded
iip-kersfield's contribution. Madera Par
'lor came next, accompanied by a live
bear which held supreme away on a float.
One hundred members of Fresno No. 25,
heralded by the Raisin City Band, made
a fine showing attired In white shirt
waists and trousers, red sashes and
sombreros. One enthusiastic member
wore a sombrero as big an a circus tent
on his brain center and did not appear
to mind tho load. The Mexican dress
added largely to the gayety manifested
by the Tenth Division.

Parlor No. 16 of Native Daughters in

young ladies had poppies strung about
them and the vehicle in which they were
seated was similarly decorated.
The feature, however, was the float of
the Napa Parlor. A miniature carriage,
arched and entirely hidden by flowers, was
in charge of a young Native Son, who
drove tandem three Shetland ponies, none
of which stood as high as a rocking horse.
Mission Parlor No. 3S, with its beautiful
silken banner on wheels, followed. The
uniform consisted of well fittine coats of
military blue, duck trousers and gray

evening and played for the delectation of

Grant Morger.stein the band rtrdored in
excellent style the most popular pieces of
the day.
Serenaded The Call.
City Hall Park was literally choked
with humanity. The hand occupied a tem
porary stand built close to the monument.
Another temporary stand had been put
up at the corYier of Powell and Market
streets and the band there attracted a
big crowd, ns did thr> one next to The Call
building. The listeners were very appre
ciative and freely applauded the musi
cians.
The band concerts on Market street last
evening entertained Immense crowds until
close onto midnight. Market street from,
Kearny to the City Hal! Park was one
continuous stream of humanity ThÂ»
broad sidewalks would not accommodate
the throng and many took to the street.
Band Concerts.
The danrinsr was under the direction of
Roberts Vandorcook. The arrangement
committee was composed of K. W. Mc-
Kinstry. W. B. FarwHl, H.- B. Russ, K.

The chandelier was covered with Jap
anese fans, from which were festooned to
the four corners of the ha'l graceful
streamers of blue buntinir. These were
caught at the ends with clusters of Amer
ican flags and varl-colTed hunting.
The hall decorations were si.nple but
effective. Back of the stage was sus
pended a largo painting, representing a
miner and farmer clasping hands, whllo
In the background the artist had painted
rich fields of wheat and auriferous moun
tains. Over the picture were these words:
"Prosperity to our country; California,
the land of Cold, Sunshine, Fruit and
Flowers."
Pioneer Hall presented an interesting
sight last evening wh^n the Society of
California Pioneers danced In honor of
the State's semi-centennial anniversary.
Many of the gray-hairf-d members joined
in the dancing with their wlvts and chil
dren. Fully 2.">0 were present, and thoso
who did not dance found pleasure in look
ing on or promenading in the adjoining
parlors and library.
The organization's banner; which Â¦was
carried In the first parado In 1S30, and
which was a feature of yesterday*! street
pageant, was inspected with much curi
osity. The banner Is still In very good
condition.
Pioneers Dance.
Dancing, interspersed with musical ana
literary programmes, was the rule last
evening. No invitation was necessary to
gain admittance to the scenes of enjoy
ment. Doors were flung open wide and
members and non-members, friends ami
visitors poured through. In many places
the crowds were so dense that dancing
was made impossible. Orchestras played
popular music and arti?ts did their best
to win the applause of their audiences.
Another day of pleasure Is before tnÂ»
natives and that they will make the most
of it i3 evidenced by the preparations
made for the close of the festivities. Open
house will be th-^ rule all .lay in some of
the headquarters. In many others thÂ«
celebration will be fittingly closed with a
grand ball.
The handsomely decorated headquartÂ«rÂ»
have been, the scer.o of much, pleasure.
Afternoon and evening since thÂ© festivi
ties were inaugurated hundreds hava
passed over the hospitable thresholds and
partaken of the viands and liquids that
were distributed with liberality. Parlor*
have vied with each other in the matter of
magnificence of entertainment and the re
sult has been that the visitor to tha heart
quarters is profoundly Impressed with tha
organization.
the Government reservation at
Fort Mason tens of thousands of visitors
and residents gathered to witness the
pyrotechnic display. The weather was
ideal. Early in the evening a heavy mist
swept over the Presidio hills and down
the coast to Fort Mason, but as If by
magic, at the boom of the llrst pun that
heralded the opening of the display, the
mlsi dissolved and the air was left clear
and Invigorating. A cloud rack, blacker
than the night Itself, drifted over the face
of the moon and the bombardment of the
heavens began.
Though many set pieces had been ar
ranged after elaborate and painstaking
labor, the feature of the evening was a
star bomb. It seemed to be a stranger
on the bill, for it had no mates. Nonn
were like it in form or color, but It wili
be remembered. Just after the opening
of the display this bomb was fired, it
mounted high into the heavens and burst
A thousand ribbons of gold leaped out
into the night from their common nucleus
until they seemed to span the horizon.
From the end of each a glittering star ap
peared, blazed like a meteor for an In
stant and disappeared. A mighty shout
from thousands of throats followed the
passing of this bomb's life, and though
the crowd w : aited long it was not again
equaled In beauty.
The display, however, Â¦was doubtless the

THIRD DAY'S FUN
I watched your splendid parade to-day of
Native Sons In the vl^or and pride of young
manhood, buoyant with hope ejid confidence,
and I put my ear to the heart of the twentieth
century, and there came echoing back the
voice: "Our progress is onward. We are
marchlnsr forward In moral and Intellectual
improvement."
SIgnorlna Italia Repetto sang and was
heartily encored. Eustace Cullinan read
an original ode to California and Theo
dore H. Hittell read a papÂ«r on the Cal
ifornia Pioneers. Signor Xicolini sang
a bass solo, and Mrs. Ema Gett, Grand
President of the Native Daughters, de
livered an address. The Golden West
Quartet sang- and responded to an en
core.
H. R, McNoble, Grand Orator of the
Native Sons, gave the oration. He said
in conclusion:
We pledge our manhood to protect Cali
fornia in years to come. The Native Sons are
the natural guardians of her destiny. Far b<Â«
it from our purpose to assume any rights
over others, but we seek by our example to
inculcate lessons of loyalty.
D. M. Lawrence sang "The Holy City"
and J. Bayard Whittemore, great-grand
son of Commodore Sloat, read the famous
proclamation of his ancestor.
Hon. Julius Kahn delivered the lease of
the old custom house at Monterey to the
Native Sons and J. J. Lerraen made the
speech of acceptance.
m
Judge Rust introduced Senator George
C. Perkins to Bpeak in place of Gov
ernor Gage, who had declined to speak,
and who spent the evening in making
formal calls at the headquarters of lhe
various parlors. Senator Perkins said:
When I first came to California all our
wheat came from Chile and our fruit from
OrpRon and the Islands of the Pacific. Now the
State Is one of the world's Ki-tuiaj-ies, and we
Ben<i wheat to Europe for the Crown 1'rlnce,

IMMEDIATELY after the parade yes
terday the various parlors that have
headquarters opened their hearts and
their bounty to their friends and the
latter accepted their hospitality with
an alacrity that was surprising. Crowds
thronged the rooms of the receiving par
lors and those composing them danced
and partook of refreshments. The parlors
have expended thousands of dollars In en
tertainment.
DAY'S INCIDENTS
OF CELEBRATION
Hugh McCabe. a brother of Owen Mc-
Cabe, feather and down merchant of 870
Mission street, was fatally injured
yesterday morning. He was walking
along Fourth street toward Market to
view the parade, and at Natoma street
crossed from one side of the street to the
other. An electric car was goinff south
at the time, and as McCabe reached the
track people shouted to him to look out.
He pain no heed to them and walked on,
the car striking' him and knocking 1 him
down. He was drappred alonp for a few
feet till the car was stopped. He was
picked up and taken to the Receiving
Hospital In the ambulance, where Dr.
Dorr found there was a fracture at the
base of his skull and lacerated wounda
on top of his scalp and on his right tem
ple, lie had a bottle of wine In his pocket
and had been celebrating. He died laat
evening.
Martin Gleason, a laborer, llv
inp at 32S Eiphth street, was fatally in
jured yesterday afternoon while viewing
the parade from the roof of 731 Mar
ket street. He was assisting the jani
tor, who is a friend of his. In looking after
the people on the roof, and by some means
or other stepped on a skylight and fell
three stories, alighting on the stairway.
He was taken to the Receiving Hospital
In the ambulance, where Dr. Starr found
that the base of his skull was fractured
and he had sustained severe Internal in
juries. He Is an unmarried man. His
brother was on the roof with him. He
died last evening.
CONSIDERING the crowds In the
streets the day's chapter of ac
cidents amounted to but little.
They were all characteristic.
Others Were Not of Much
Consequence.
Two Were Fatol, but the
DAY'S ACCIDENTS
WERE VERY FEW
most .gorgeous of recent years. Flower
pots of marvelous size and beauty: rock
ets which freed multi-colored stars that
sailed through the air on tiny parachutes;
set pieces of intricate design and gor
geous colorings all contributed to the
beauty of the display. By half-past 9 the
last bomb had lighted the heavens and
the word? "Good Night" In blazing let
ters of gold turned the people homeward.
Though the railway lines are not nu
merous In that portion of the city the
vast crowd was well handled not an
accident or unpleasant Incident was re
ported by the police.
Foresters, with Chief Ranker
Max Boehm and other officers in
carriages. The float was a forest scene
In which were to be seen chief rangers,
BUbchlefs. v.-ocdwardp, beadles and com
panions of the forest. Drowsing, on fresh
preen grafs instead of tomato cajis, was
a live goat, which, presumably is riddon
by those who wish to become Foresters.
Then followed the display of the Ancient
Order of Druids, consisting of two floats
one re;>ref=et!rip the second dpgree of the
order, in which It ip taught that a Druid
never takes advantage of an opportunity
to wreak his vengeance on a fallen foe,

was a very attractive division, for the
members, mounted and afoot, were nea.r
l.v all attired in Indian costumes, with
vari-colored feathers in their hair and
their faces painted. The first of four
fjoats was an Indian tepee in a forest, rep
resenting the eelt-brattrd picture of Foca

on a!l kinds of Indian ponies, each letting
out shouts of the warwhoop order, but
not quito eo terrifying- as the g-emilne ar
:i'-Ie. Those on foot, several hundred in
number, added to the tumult of their
mounted brethren. Cherokee Tribe of

fire, the chief characters being- P. Salis
bury, prophet; G. N. Ferrin. pachem; A.
St-ulip. senior samraore. and H. N. Over

other Indian forest scene turned out by
the Great Council of the Reservation o'f
California, and one representing primi
tlvo Indian life pr.pared by the members
iff Yosemite Trib*. This was followed by
the- Indian method of carrying a wounded
individual on a trailing litter attached to
a pony. The division closed with a num
ber of members cf the order in recralia.
The great chiefs rode in carriages.
PIONEERS and native sons ond
daughters crowded Native Sons'
Hall last night until every seat
was taken and . even standing
room could not be had In the rear
of the hall. Hundreds were turned away.
The literary exercises â the formal feature
of the celebrationâ were held there, and
in their own way were as great a success
as the parade. \
The hall was elaborately decorated. Fes
toons of preenery swunR from the chande
lier to the gallery rail. Yellow bunting
was u?ed in profusion, and bear flags and
the national colors met the eye wherever
Its i^aze was directed.
After an overture by the orchestra,
Daniel A. Ryan, chairman of the commit
tee on literary exercises, introduced
JudRe. R. C. Rust. Grand President of the
Native Sons of the Golden West.
Judge Rust was received with rounds of
applause. He spoke briefly as follows:
I Â»rreet you all as CallfornlanB. for after
to-day' a Klnrlous demonstration I feel that I
am justified In so doing. After fifty years of

THE GRAND STAND.
GOVERNOR HENRY T. GAGE ar
rived at the reviewing stand on
Van Ness avenue, near Post street.
Just as the advancing regulars turned for
the countermarch. The splpndfd chargers
of Troop A of the National Guard
swung from the lint?, the troopers, led by
Captain Charles Jansen, forming the
guard while the Governor took his posi
tion In the stand. His Excellency was
received by Grand Marshal Costello. Tie
responded to the salute of Adjutant Gen
eral Seamans, and the cavaJry escort Â¦with
drew. A few minutes later Major General
Shaftor. U. S. V.. and staff arrived In
carriages. General Shatter . urged his
portly form from his carriage, stamped
his troupers down around his ankles, and
mounted the steps, followed by his
staff, who were In full dress. Rear
Admiral Albert Kautz, U. S. X., and
staff were escorted to the stand later and
were followed by Major General John H.
Dickinson and staff and Brigadier Gen
eral M. W. Muller and staffâ and the re
view was on.
The measured tramp of the regulars
started the vast crowds that lined the
streets to shouting. Governor Gage
bowed acknowledgment to the salutes of
the marchers as did General Shafter, \d
miral Kautx and General Muller. The
military division passed without a halt
and then came the enthusiasm. Cheer
after cheer sprang from the throats of
the marching legion. r>istinijuisherl per
sonages in tbe line and occupying points
of vantage were honored by the many
divisions. As the various parlors of the
Native Sons and Daughters pastfed the
; residence of Claus Spreckels, Van Ness
avenue ami Clay streets, they paused and
to thoir elvers anl salutations Mr. and
Mrs. Bprecktls, who were viewing the
parade, bowed acknowledgment.
Gray-haired veterans of the Mexican
find Civil wars bared their heads In sa
lute as they passed the stand and the
home guard moved as a machine to the
ordtr of their commanders in honor of
including the automobiles and loco
mobiles of various kinds. As these moved
along one could not help thinking 'of the
line from the so-called Mnther Shipton
prophecy, "Carriages without horses shall
go." The display, made up of fifteen car
riages, was a novel one.
THIETY-SIXTH.
THE thirty-sixth division was the last
of the grand parade and was com
posed entirely nf horseless carriages.
and Edward Cartagnetto aids.
There were two striking features in this
division, the Italian Carabinierl and the
float of the San Francisco Gardeners' and
Ranchers' Association. This was an ar
rangement'to represent agriculture by the
product of the ranches very tastfully ar
ranged, with a handsome young lady. Miss
Clelia LaKomarslnn. as the goddess of
agriculture. The balance of the division
wan made up of the Italian Mutual Ben
evolent Society and the. Cavalllcria Gen
ova.
THE thirty-fifth division wan the
Italian division, of which G.
Iaochheri was marshal and J. Kignre
THIRTY-FirTH.
Kuhls as aids. This was made up
of the Schwaben Vereln, the Order of
Hermann's Son* and the Eintracht Rifle
Society. The Hermann's Sons, who turned
out about 350 men, had a magnificent float
that represented Hermann by the side of
his horse, surrounded by a number of his
torical fipures. Hermann was personated
by John Pope: the Goddess of Liberty by
Mrs. L. Keeker; Washington by Henry
Maret; Miss Beidenbach represented Cali
fornia, and several other characters were
personated by pretty Mttlo ptr!s. Occupy
ing a position of honor on this float were
August Beidenbach and Leo Fahri, who
for forty years, have been members of
the order.
THIRTY-FOURTH.
EW. GUNTHER led the thirty
fourth division as marshal, with
â¢ Guptav Guenther and Henry A.
Noble Grand Arch Jam^s F. Martlnonl,
Grand Secretary Graves and other grand
officers rode In Tirriapef. Then followed
the float of the French Colony, one of th<j
moFt artistic in the procession. It was
emblematic of the two countriesâ America
and Franceâ phowinjr the friendship of the
two countries in allegorical figures. It
was much admired. Quite a number of
those who compose the French Colony
rode in carriages and brought up the rear
of a very attractive division.

SICK WOMFN WEIL."At Texas City three of the residents were drowned. One man stepped into a
well by a mischance and his corpse was found there. Two other men ventured
â¢along the bay front during tÂ»/e height of the storm and were killed. There are
few buildings at Texas City that don't tell of the storm. The hotel is a complete
ruin. The oftlce of the Texas City Company has some of the walls standing with
all the upper walls stripped off. Nothing remains of the piers except the piling.
The wreckage from GfllvestOD litters the shore for miles and is a hundred yard3
or more wide. For ten miles inland from tho shore it is a common sight to see
small craft, such as stÂ«Â»am launches, schooners and oyster sloops. The lifeboat
of the llf.e-sa.vlng station was carried half a mile inland, while a vessel that was
anchored in Moses Bayou lies high and dry fivo miles up from Lamarque.
"The Oaiveston News asked to have it announced that all the men of its staff
are safÂ«v"
"It will take a week to tabulate the dead and the missing and to get any
thing near an approximate Idea of the money loss. It Is safe to assume that one
half of the property of the city is wiped out and that one-half of the residents
have to face absolute poverty.
"Eis?ht ocean steamers were torn from thoir moorings and stranded In the
bay. The Kendall Castle was carried over the flats from the Thirty-third-street
wharf to Texas City, and lies in the wreckage of the Inman pier. The Norwe
gian steamer Gyller Is stranded between Texas City and Virginia Point. An
ocean liner was swirled around through the West Bay. crashed through the bay
bridges and Is now Iyinp In a foot of water near the wreckage of the railroad
bridges. The steamship Taunton was carried across Pelican Point and is strand
ed about ten miles up the east bay. The Mallory steamer Alamo was torn from
her wharf and dashei upon Pelican flats and upon the bow of the British steamer
Red Cross, which had previously been hurled there. The stern of the Alamo is
stove in and the bow of the Red Cross is crushed. Down the channel toward the
jetties two other ocean steamships lie grounded. Some schooners, barges and
smaller craft are strewn bottom side up along the piers. The tug Louise of the
Houston Direct Xavigration Company is also a wreck.
"Of the new Southern Pacific wharf little remains but the piling. Half a mil
lion feet of lumber was carried away and Engineer Hoschke says that as far as
the company is concerned It mipht as well start over again.
"Many 5tnries were m ent of houses falling and inmates escaping. Clarence
N. Ousley. editor cf the Kvehlng Tribune, had his family and the families of two
neighbors In his house when the lower half crumbled and the upper part slipped
down Into the water. Xo one in the house Â¦was hurt. Of the I^avine family six
out of seven are reported d^ad. Of the Burnett family only one is known to
have been saved. The family of Stanley G. Spencer, who met death in the Cot
ton Exchange saloon, is reported to be dead. Tho Mistrot House, in the west end,
was turned into a hospital. All of the regular hospitals of the city were un
available.
"Some of the stories of e?cnpc<* are miraculous. William Nishctt, a cotton
man. was buried in tho ruins of the Cotton Exchange Saloon and when dug out
in the morning had no further injury than a few bruised flnpers. Dr. S. O.
Yourp. secretary of the Cotton Kxehanjre, was knocked senseless when his house
collapsed, but was revived by the water and was carried ten blocks by the hur
ricane. A woman who had ir.st given birth to a child was carried from her home
to a house a block distant' the men who wore carrying her having to hold her
};ish above thtir heads, ss (.hie water was five feet deep when she was moved.
SOME MOST MIRACULOUS ESCAPES.
"In the business portion of the city two large brick buildings, one occupied by
Kr.app Bros, and tho other by th<Â» Cotton Exchange Faloon, collapsed. In the
Cotton Exchange Saloon there wore about fiftoen persons. Most of them escaped.
"Up to the time I I<~ft Galvoston three dead had been taken from the ruins.
Thev were: \
"STANLEY G. SPENCER; manager of the Elder-Dempster Steamship Com
pany. Â¦ #
"RTCHARD J,ORT>. traffic manner for denrce McPaflden & Bro.
"CHARLKS U. KKU.ER of the firm of Lamraer? & Flint.
"How many more corpses thpre are will not be known until the search Is fin
ished. The oil mills, the bagging factory, the gas works, the electric light works
nnd nearly ail the industrial establishments of the city are either wrecked or
crippled. The flood Irft a slime about an inch deep over the whole city and unless
fast progress is made in burying corpses and carcasses of animals there Is dan
ger of pestilence.
"The life-savinK station at Fort Point was carried away, the crew being swept
across the bay fourteen miles to Texas City I saw Captain Haines yesterday
and he told me that his wife and one of his crew were drowned. The shore at
Texas City cortnins enough wreckage to rebuild a city. Klght persons who were
f=w?pt across the l>ay duriner th<* storm were picked up there alive. Five corpses
were also picked up. There wrre thrte fatalities in Texas City. In addition to
the living and the dead which the storm cast up at TcNas City, caskets and cof
fins from one of the cemeteries at Galveston were being fished out of the water
there yesterday.
"At the forts nearly all the soldiers are reported dead, they having been in
temporary quarters which gave them no protection against the tempest or the
flood. No report has hcen received from the Catholic Orphan Asylum down the
island, but it seems impossible that it could have withstood the hurricane. If
it fell all the Inmates were without doubt lost, for there was no aid within a
mile.
"The bay front from end to end is in ruins. Nothing but piling and the
wreck of great warehouses remain. The elevators lost all their upper works and
their stocks are <1amaced by water.
"The first hurried plane" over thft city showed that the largest structures,
supposed to he the most substantially built, suffered the most. The Orphans'
Home. Twenty-first and avenue M, fell like a house of cards. How many dead
children and r^fupees are in the ruins could not be ascertained. Of the sick in
St. Mary's Infirmary, toRether with tho attendants, only eigtit are understood
to have been saved. The Old Women's Home on Rosenberg: avenue collapsed.
The Rosenbcrp schoolhoupo is a mass of wreckage. The Ball High School is but
an empty shell, crushed a.nd broken. Every church in the city, with possibly one
or two exceptions, is in ruins.

lost youth. But it does claim to heal, strengthen and revitalize the
mucous membrane which lines the entire body.

HOURS OF LABOR-C. A. R., City.
The right to legislate on hours of labor is
left to the Legislatures of the different
States of the Union. Congress regulates
the hours of labor as to all matters that
come under Federal jurisdiction. The
eight-hour law of 1,592 passed by Con
gress restricts to eight hours the working
day of all laborers and mechanics em
ployed by the United States, by the Dis
trict of Columbia or by any contractor
upon any of the United States public
works. There Is an tight-hour law gov
erning miners In Germany. In Australia
there is such a law governing miners,
those employed on public works and ser
vants employed in public works. In
England there is no general eight-hour
law, although there is much agitation 'r
favor of. such.
SURLOIN-C. City. Skeat in his ety
mological dictionary says that "sir loin"
Is "bad spelling of surloin" and that sur
loin is that which is above the loin and
adds that "the story about turning the
loin into sir loin by knighting it is mers
trash." The story alluded to by Skeafis
that when James the First was enter
tained at Hogton Tower, near Blackburn
he was more witty In his speech than
usual. While he was at the table he cast
his eyes upon a noble surloin at the lower
end of the table and called out. "Brlnfy
hither- that surloin, sirrah, for 'tis
worthy of a more honorable post, as I
may say, not surloin. but sir-loin, the
noblest joint of all." He did not draw his
sword and knight it sir loin. Dr. John
son was 'the first lexicographer who
changed the spelling from surloin to sir
loin. '. v -*__il_i^_li^^ Â¦Â¦Â¦**'â¢ '"Â¦Â¦

ANSWEES TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Warm and even enthusiastic praise is du e to the
men who promoted and organized the grand observ
ance of the day. From first to last all was excel
lently done. The line was long and hours were re
quired for it to pass a given point, but so varied were
the displays made by the different parlors of Native
Sons and Daughters and other organizations taking
part in it, that the interest of the spectators never
wearied. At every moment a new feature of attrac
tive power came into view. Many of the floats will
long be remembered for their beauty and will serve
as models for similar parades in future. In short, it
was a glorious pageant and the' thousands of specta
tors who watched it will bear it in their memories
and delight hereafter to tell of the splendor of the
jubilee day.
has been called by every term signifying the highest
type of the eternal feminine of which men have
dreamed. She has been the star of festal halls, the
wonder of thronerooms, the brightest beauty in the
glittering circle of royal opera-houses, and Princes
and Kings have done homage to her grace and glory:
but she never was more superb than when in equality
with her brothers she marched through the streets
and adorned the celebration of California's jubilee.
It goes without saying that the best of the parade
was the presence of the Native Daughters. For many
a year past it has been rioted that the California
woman is more distinctively Californian than anything
else in the State. Visitors from other lands look upon
her with admiration and rapture. She has been
called a gpddcss, she has been called an Amazon, she
ment made in every feature of such spectacles. The
street decorations arc brighter, the floats are finer
and more artistic, the order of the procession is better
observed and the crowds that throng the streets have
a gayer and more festnl spirit. It is evident that we
are a people who love color and music and light and
motion. We are a community made up of nearly all
races on earth, we have, differences of creed, politics,
h-.nguage.and social customs, but when it comes to
holiday- making and street parades, we are all'Cali
fornians. In that regard it may be truly said there is
but one California and we are the people.
We have become .t pageant-loving people and we
are rapidly developing ?. talent as well as a taste in
that direction. Each new occasion sees an improve-
The day was gloomy. The mists of the ocean had
come'to town to sec the show. They put a leaden
darkness over the sky and they dampened the air, but
they did not darken the brightness of the parade nor
dampen the spirits of those who took part in it. In
fact, the soft gray of the atmosphere formed an artistic
background for the brilliant display that was pictured
against it. Perhaps mere sunlight would have meant
less beauty. At any rate,' no one thought of com
plaining of the mist. The day was fair enough for a
holiday and all of San Francisco and a goodly portion
of the rest of California were out of doors to enjoy it.
/""* ALIFORNIA has made the largest, the gayest
1 and the grandest parade in her history and has a
right to be proud of it. From first to last it
was distinctively Californian. In point of numbers it
was not equal to the mighty procession which New
York marched along her streets in welcome to Ad
miral Dewey, returning home from his epoch-making
victory at Manila; nor in point of splendor
could it compare with the magnificent pageant which
delighted London at the celebration of the jubilee of
Victoria's reign, but it had a charm, lacking in those
superb displays, the charm of representing a whole
people, young and old; men and women; every class,
kind, manner and degree that make up the popula
tion of the State.

There is no ether problem of the State more im
portant than this. The destruction of the woods of
California is going forward at a fearful rate. , The
hills arc being denuded and. streams that once flowed
steadily throughout the year are becoming torrential
in their nature, pouring off their waters in disastrous
floods during the rainy season and drying up \ n
summer. We are in this respect wasting at the bung
p.nd the spigot both. Â¦ We are threatening the future
with a blight of direful proportions and we are doing
it through sheer negligence in the face of repeated
warnings such as that which has now been given at
Monterey.
*
Surely it is time for '.he people of California to profit
hy these lessons so numerous, so frequent and so de
ftructive. It i< known to every intelligent man that
the full extent of the damage done by a forest fire can
hardly be calculated. It requires a century for a
forest to grow and it may be swept into nothingness
by fire in a single <Iay. Moreover, when the forest
fells there perishes .vith it one of nature's means of
supplying the region with water at all seasons of the
year. Thus a double damage is done and the evil
effects arc felt for years after the fire itself has faded
from memory.
The Call has returned to this subject again and
again during the past summer because the people are
to elect a Lcgislatur/this fail and the preservation of
forestr ought to be made an issue. of the legislative
e'ectior is ever;/ dinrict in the State. From every
candidate fcr :: legislative office the people should
exact a- pledge that if elected he will support some
\ve!l considered plan for providing for a comprehen
sive dnd scientific system of protecting the woods and
conserving the water. supply. The issue ought not to
be postponed. Each successive dry season brings
with it a host of fires in the fields, the pastures and the
woods. Therefore even- year of delay is costly, and
since the Legislature meets but once in two years, a
neglect to act during the coming winter will postpone
action for two years.
rROM Monterey come reports of a forest fire
sweeping over icrcs of territory and destroying
thousands of dollars' worth of valuable trees.
It is but a short time ago since similar reports came
from the vicinity of Los Angeles and not long be
fore that the news of the day told of fires in several
of the mountain counties. Thus in one part of the
State after another these object lessons occur, all
teaching the same truth that no reasonable system of
forest preservation would be half so costly as is the
re gleet.

LATEST STORIES
of the
FUNNY MAN.
SOMEWHERE in or on this side of
the Straits of Magellan there la a
speck of a vessel, which before she
reaches her journey's end, will have
beaten the Oregon's famous run in the op
posite direction by several hundred miles.
This small craft is the tug Slocum, the
property the quartermaster's department
of the United States army. It was found
necessary to have a tugboat in TS-in Fran
cisco harbor, and the only thing the <3e
â¢larlment could do was to send one around
from New York. The Slocum, which Ava
bought by the Government In 1S0S, was
faelotled and was put into dry dock for
lepairs for the long and perilous journey.
Shq Ks the largest tugboat ever built on
Uh> Delaware, "and was launched in 1S08
at Hillman's shipyard.
1 hÂ«. present journev will test the quali
ties of the stanch little craft to the ut
most, and her log will be read with inter
est by seafaring men when she makes
port.
The worst part of the trip Is that
through the straits and- just outside on
this coast of the South American conti
nent. Heavy seas are the rule in this part
The tug is constructed of steol through
out. Her length is I<i2 feet, beam 23 feet
and depth of hold 10 feet, and her draught
is from 14 to 1R feet. She has two steel
boilers and triple expansion engines,*with
1200 estimated horse power. She is eloo
trie lighted and has steam .steering gear.
The total distance of the voyage is 14.204
miles and the sailing time is 57 days an!
14 hours. She will coal several times on
the trip, as her capacity admits of steam
ing only about 30OO miles without replen
ishing her bunkers.
The Slocum is in command of Captain
K. J. Hampton, United States army, quar
termaster's department, and has a sail
ing master and navigator.
The Slocum left Xew York July 12 last.
Six days later she was reported at St
Thomas, West Indies, and August 12 was
at Buenos Ayrcs. She was to make steps
at Punta Arenas In the straits and at
Callao and Acapulco. on the west coast.
Her average rate of speed Is ten miles an
hour.
of the world, and sometimes steamers of
largest size find difficulty in making head
way. Even the great battle ship Oregon
had to run to shelter on her trip east
ward when she struck the entrance to
Magellan.
To that end the Governor should be requested to
set as soon as the first call for help comes from Texas.
Indeed, it would be well for him to appoint the com
mittee nt once. Wben the people of a sister State
arc suffering California should not wait for urging
to proffer assistance.
In a case of this kind there should be nothing of
personal advertising. ;ior should any self-seeker be
permitted to take advantage of it to make a profit
or a reputation for himself. It is well known that
whenever great disasters occur and widespread appeals
for contributions are made there are many subscrip
tion papers put into circulation, and not infrequently
dcunright frauds arc worked upon the generous in
that way. A committee appointed by the Governor,
;,nd having representatives in every county, would
guard the public against that class of fakers, and
would moreover be more likely to raise a liberal sum
for relief.-
It is clear if help l>e needed the request will come
to the people of the whole State. Consequently the
Governor, as the official head of the State, is the
proper person to take the initiative in the matter. He
should appoint a committee representing all sections
ci the State to receive the contributions Californian?
will make to the relief fund and promptly forward
them to the authorities in Texas.
rROM the reports that come from Gjtlvcston and
other parts of Texas concerning the damage
done by the hurricane of Saturday, it seems
probable the extent of the loss will be so great that
an appeal for aid will he made to the nation at large.
it goes without saying such an appeal will be promptly
responded lo. and the people of California will be as
ouick and as liberal a? any in contributing to the
need? oi the Miffercr-. It is therefore worth while
to consider at once the best means of acting should
the appeal come, so that no delay will occur and no
;nistake be made.

The President should be thanked for clearing the air. That his letter will win for him
the respect of all his countrymen, who respect what deserves it, is undoubted. It is a grat
ifying illumination of the situation and the country will walk forward more confidently in
The obligations of a protectorate are distinctly imperial in their nature: If there be
a future reaction against holding the Philippines our responsibility then must cease with
our sovereignty. This goes straight to American common sense. It leaves Colonel Bryan
without a foot to stand on or" a place to plant it. It exposes the puerility of his propo
sition, the half-balled conditions of his views. With it anti-expansionists cannot quar
rel It leaves no room for controversy.
This transfers the whole debate to the future, to a time to come, to a day on which
this nation is to declare its permanent intention and its lasting relation to the Philippines.
Into this field the President pursues Colonel Bryan with logic that is inexorable. In the
briefest form he cuts Colonel Bryan's proposed policy out of its gilt frame and holds it up,
stripped of all accessories. The stage properties and grease paint, the trickery of light
and shade, are taken away and in this almost cruel nakedness the President presents it:
"In short, the proposition of those opposed to us is to continue all the obligations in
the Philippines which now rest upon the Government, only changing the relation from
principal, which now exists, to that of surety. Our responsibility is to remain, but our
power is to be diminished. Our obligation is to be no less, but our title is to be sur
rendered to another power, which is without experience or training or the ability to
maintain a stable government at hcrme and absolutely helpless to^ perform its inter
national obligations with the rest of the world. To this we are opposed. We should not
yield our title while our obligations last."
When this time and the future which is "now discussed shall have become the past
that statement will stand.
The country will neither repudiate nor harshly judge a President who is able to offer
justification in terms of such force. Submitting to his countrymen the reasons that im
pelled him and the conditions that seemed to justify them, it is now in order for his
opponent to traverse the case again and point out where he would have, clone differently,
and how. Would he have ordered Dewey out of Manila Bay after Montejo's fleet was
sunk, and where? Would he have disfavored the ratification of the treaty of Paris, and
why? Would he have left the citizens and subjects of other nations domiciled in the
Philippine? to the protection of such government as would have remained after Spanish
sovereignty was cut by the sword? Let him state specifically the difference of policy at
any point in the past. Of course, he will not do this, because he cannot. It would not be
good for his fame to do so.
Upon our external policy the President takes the country unreservedly into his
confidence. What lie has done may fall short of the expectations of some. It may
overgo the wish of others. But he in no degree trims or tacks to please either. In no spirit
of vainglory, nor greed, nor fondness for the exercise of power, he tells the story from the
beginning with clearness and simplicity. The beginning of our grievous responsibili
ties is given â it is history. The progressive unfolding of events, each bringing its du
ties and each a key to what had preceded, is stated. It is difficult for any friend whose
rebuke is kind, or any enemy whose criticism is noxious, to review the narration and
point out the exact place at which any difference of policy either could or should have
been followed. It is plainly discernible that the President clearly comprehends that we
are not at the end. The conclusion may be far or near. But we can neither run nor
stand until we reach the point from which either must be done.
The country will receive with lively satisfaction the President's clear statement of
the establishment of the gold standard and its effects and the necessity that it shall not
be overthrown. Treating his opponent with the greatest courtesy, he states, with fair
ness, his opposition to the gold standard and his enmity to sound money and, crediting
him with honesty of purpose, quotes the pledges he has solemnly made to wage un
ceasing war upon the /fold standard, sound money and the public credit, until they are
piled in a common ruin. There is no use splitting syllables over how this is to be done.
Colonel Bryan is pledged against the gold standard and the President is pledged to it.
Those who believe that standard to be the^mly safe and necessary foundation to the
public credit, to the profits of trade and the welfare of labor, have the issue made plain.
That, they will vote their conscience and their interest in November is saying that
bamboozlery has never yet captured the American people.
PRESIDENT McKINLEY'S letter of acceptance will strike a popular chord
throughout the country. He wisely deferred it until the fire of the opposition had
been drawn and then returned a broadside of unmistakable force and clearness.
It is a plain and strong statement. The business and industrial condition' of the country
is so set forth as to be within rather than beyond the facts, and is in most striking con
trast to Colonel Bryan's persistent calamity appeal, made now as the overture, again
as the interlude and sometimes as the finale of his appeal for 'votes. The country's
common sense at once sees that the President's moderate and truthful statement of
economic conditions suggests the risk and hazard of a change to an administration un
der Colonel Bryan, who closes his eyes to what is and pretends to see what is not. Ajiain
the President salutes all of his countrymen of every section, treats them as embarked
together, sailing in the same boat to the same destination, while he wishes them all,
without invidious distinction, equality of happiness and fortune. Really, sending his
letter is grateful relief from the daily preaching of the gospel of grudge and appeals to
class to raise its hand against class, indulged in by Colonel Bryan.
The chances of saving the May Flint

The Populist convention spent the even

had been made arbitrarily by the State
Central Committee, as no straight Popu
list ticket had been voted for in the State
since 1893. Serious charges of fraud wero
made against certain members of the com

by Hon. Thomas Patterson, was adopted

DENVER, Sept. 10.â Three State con

will be made to effect a fusion. This is
understood to be favored with practical
unanimity by the delegates to the Silver
Republican ,and Populist conventions.
Among the Democrats, however, there is
a division on the subject. A State ticket
is to be chosen, but the greatest interest
is felt in the effect the result of these con
ventions will have on the race for the
United States Senatorshlp. Senator E. O.

to be the Republican candidate. For the
opposition there are a number of avowed

from distant parts of the Stntc. Both
meetings were held In the rink, an im

those able to get in.
At the afternoon meeting Senator Nel
son of Minnesota spoke upon the issues
of thÂ« day with great effect for three
quarters of an hour. He Introduced Gov
ernor Roosevelt, who was received with
nattering cheers. In the course of his
speech Governor Roosevelt said:
"We are confronted in this campaign
with two issues, of which they say one is
paramount and the other is immediate.
The paramount issue is militarism and
imperialism and the immediate issue Is
free silver. They have Insisted as little
as possible upon the latter. They have
been for it, but not so much for It as to
frighten the gold men away. You can
not be half-heartedly for a depreciated
dollar. You may tlnd difficulty in mak
ing up your mind. At Kansas City they
had great difficulty in determining what
to do iri regard to the linancial plank of
the platform. If you remember, they were

ROOSEVELT SPEAKS
ON NATIONAL/ ISSUES
Ma!nÂ«Â» stands by the ppjcndiii administration
nf William McKinley. Thfl voters of the Pine
Troe State have given to-day the largpst Re
publican maiority ever givpn in the history of
the State to" any party, with the single excep
tion of four years atto. when our opponents
were completely larnlyzed and threw th;?
smallest vote they ever cast in a Presidential
vrar since 1SG0. The Republicans, njrainst a
determined nnd united nomocracy, have car
ried every county pave one In the Ptate. elect
ing more than K>n out of 1S1 members of thÂ«
Keeislature. Which will return to tlie United
States Senate \VUllam P. Fry"- We have
elected our delecnttnn to Congress l;y majorltieÂ»
ranpInK from 7f.no to ift.OOO. We have carriM
the" Ftate by 31.0C0 majority, out of a total
vote of lir',000.
The Republican State ticket was elected
with all but four Congressmen and a great
majority of the Legislature. There was
every Incentive for voting, and the cam
paign had been a spirited one. The vote
was not quite as heavy as in 1S96, but ex
ceeded that of the 1S3S election by thou
sands. The Democrats gained much satis
faction from the earlier returns, showing
as thev did. a gain in four years of from
IS to per cent. This increase over tho
1SQ6 vote did not apply to any particular
locality, but seemed to be general
throughout the State. *
The Republicans, however, had rather
discounted the falling oft In the vote for
the Maine district ticket I'rom that in 1896.
and the managers were not at all sur
prised at an apparent loss of 12 per cent
shown by the returns from tho lirst 150
towns. Their entire ticket, headed by J.
P Hill for Governor, was elected, as were
all four of the Congressmenâ Allen In
Reed's old district. Littlefield in Dingley's
old district, Burleigh in the Third and
Boutello in the Fourth.
The campaign throughout the State, ex
cept perhaps in Cumberland County, was
fought entirely on national Issues. .In
Cumberland County, with Portland as a
center, there was fought one of the most
interesting contests in the State. This
was solely on the liquor law, its enforce
ment or lion-enforcement, the Republican
representing the latter and a Prohibition
candidate the former issue. The light was

showing her intention to continue to oc

further light. From Shanghai comes a re
port that Li Hung Chang has dispatched
an urgent telegram to the Empress Dcw
ager at Tui-yuen-fu announcing the pur
pose of the allies to advance to Pao

opinion is that Peking is to be merely a

WASHINGTON. Sept. 10.â Tho Chinese.
Minister. Mr. Wu, to-day delivered to the
State Department a copy of the imperial
edict conferring on l.i Hung Chang abso
lute and unconditional authority to ne
gotiate with the powers for peace and for
the settlement of questions growing out
of the war. The edict is dated on the
last dav of the seventh month, Chinese
calendar, which is about August 24. It
is issued by tnc Emperor and not the Em
press Dowager, indicating that the former
is now exercising those imperial functions
which some of the powers, notably" Grrat
ISritain, have Insisted belonged to him,
rather than to the Empress Dowager.
The document docs not show the place- at
Which it was issued, but it was transmit
ted through Pao-ting-fu, and probably
emanated there, as the imperial household
has been at that point for somo time.

Li Hung Chang yesterday promised. Mr.

that he was greatly pleased with the ap
pointment of his "old friend Foster" as a
peace commissioner.

thanking her for ridding the country of

WASHINGTON*. Sept .- 10.â Thn
developments of the day in the j
Chinese situation still point j
to a speedy withdrawal of |
the United States troops from ,
China. Gem-ial Chaff ee has
sdded the weight of his opinion to that j
already entertained by many officials ]
here. It probably is significant that the !
general's statement on this point was j
Eivon publicity by the administration. j
No confirmation is at hand here of the j
report that Groat Britain and Germany
have joined In an agreement to remain,
together in Peking regardUss of the atti
tude of the otner powers. Should this be
true the fact doubtless would hasten the
rearward movement of the American
troops, for thore Is a determination to
avoid becoming involved in any clash
with the powers, as mlfiht reason
ably be expected to follow the execution
of this reported. Britlsh-Cierman pro
gramme. If there have been any further
responses to the Russian note relative to
evacuation, their purport cannot be ascer
tained. This delay no longer interferes
with the execution of the American pol
icy. Tnc Suite Department has a reason
aoly accurate understanding of the atti
tude of even those powers that have not
made formal resporses to the Russian
note so that the mere written record of
their views is not of importance. The
part of the problem relative to with
drawal that remains unsolved is the best
means of securing guarantees lor the at
tainment of the few objects set out in Sec
retary Hay's note of July 3, which have
not yet been Â«t cured.
Possibly guarantees must be obtained
from two Fi<i<Â»i* â trom the Chinese Gov
ernment as to the security of American
treaty rights; and the creation of a claims

payment of Indemnity for the losses suf
fered by American citizens and for the

NEW YORK, Sept. 10.â After revela
tions made in affidavits by wives
of the two pugilists, corroborated
by others concerned in the deal, no |
one can well refuse to believe that
a gigantic swindle was perpetrated on the I
public by CorbeU and McCoy. What pu
ported to be a jfrlze fight, it seems, wa3
nothing more than a carefully rehearsed
imitation. More than 173,000 was taken in
at the gates and a much larger sum was
realized as a result of the wagers made in
a manner that amounted to sheer rob
bery.
These facts, which have been more t.ian
surmised since the fight, are set forth In
affidavits made by the wives "of the two â¢
pugilists, each of whom has brought suit
against her husband for divorce. When
McCoy, referring to Mrs. Corbett, quoted
"Hell hath' no fury like a woman
scorned," he might also have had his own
wife in mind. McCoy last week served
papers on his wife for divorce. Now h<s
is In hiding to escape service In a counter
suit. The charges made against him are
of a sensational nature. Divorce Is de
manded on statutory grounds. Mrs. Selby
concludes her petition with the declara
tion that her husband bargained to for
feit the tight with CorDett ror a price anj
that ho posted $10,000 to guarantee that he
would keep faith with his co-conspirators.
"Eddie" Burke, one of the best known
bookmakers in this country, is named as
the man Â¦who held the forfeits posled by
the two pugilists.
McCoy brought his marital troubles to
a .climax by beginning action for divorce,
his brother serving the papers on his wife
last Friday. McCoy named James Kin
ney and George Stearns as co-respond
ents, charging his wife with improper con
duct with them.
' Mrs. Selby's response was prompt. She
consulted Mr. Hummell. the result being
nn ordep-for nrrest obtained from Judge
Scott, who named the bail as $5000. Mc-
Coy's arrest was planned for to-night, it
being the intention to serve the warrant
when he returned to this city from a pic
nic. McCoy's friends, however, heard of I
the contemplated arrest and gave the j
pugilist warning. I
Special Dispatch, to The Call.
Tn her answer to her husband s com
plaint Mrs. Selby says among: other
things: "Recently my husband has bo
come possessed of a larpe sum of money.
amounting to J1C0.00Q In cash, which he
secured in the following manner:
As such nrof^Psional prize tighter
my husband. Norman Selby,. other
wise known as 'Kid' McCoy,
entered into a conspiracy In which a con
test was to take place between him and
one James J. Corbett. It being prear
ranged that he -was not to try to win
said contest, but to permit himself to be
defeated
"An additional part of said conspiracy
was that the parties got up a cipher code
for telegraphing purposes and from time
to time my husband dictated to me tele
graphic messages, which I wrote, and
which were telegraphed to Harry Hinds at
Cheyenne. The telegrams were to the ef
fect that said Hinds and his co-conspira
tors were to bet that Corbett would be the
victor In said contest."
Mrs. Corbett in demanding a divorce
from her husband practically corroborates
everything said by Mrs. Selby.
She said to a Call representative: "The
meeting in my husband's saloon when it
was said that a fight was narrowly avert
ed was prearranged for the purpose of Im
pressing the public. Jim told me that a
friend of his named Harry Hinds had
charge of the betting in the "West. My
husband bet several thousand dollars in
this city and when I last saw him he saiil
that he had -made about $50,000 out of the
fight.
"Now he has pone to England with an
other woman. Well, she is welcome to
him."
When he left New York Corbett took
with him moro money than he was sup
posed to possess. He had In his pocket
$21,000 In bills. He took with him also a
letter of credit drawn on the Paris Rank
(limited) of London, calling for $100,000
and a second HUer of credit drawn on a
Paris bank for f.7).000. It Is asserted that
he and the young singer whose departure
was coincident with his own were booked
on the Campania as "Mr. and Mrs. Mar
tin." The young woman's mother occu

Fair Meet.
Hobart Gets a Hard Spill in the Polo

Playing, Though Without

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMEXTO, Sept. 10.â The big cele
bration in the bay city did not wholly
depopulate this burg, for a large holiday
throng filled the inclosurcs of Agricul
tural Park this afternoon, the grsnd
stand being comfortably filled with peo
ple, the fair sex predominating, while the
betting ring was jammed with specula
tors.
The Roman, driven in the most cultured
fashion by Ed Lafferty. captured the
Stanford trotting stake (for foals of 1S97),
valued at $765, in -straight heats and
proved the only winning choice on the
card. The fast 3-ycr.r-oUl was held a pro
hibitive favorite in what limited wagering
was indulged in, winning on each occason
with seconds to spare. Behind him Ben
Liebes and Tom Smith, also sons of Mc-
Kinney. annexeii second and third money
respectively.
Immediately following came the 2:12 trot
with about the same equine stars as these
answering the roll call for the 2:10 trot
decided last Â¦week and won by Dolly Dill
on. To-day Hazel Kinney turned the ta
bles on Dolly, taking the second, fourth
and fifth heats. Before the horses were
called Dolly Dillon brought $20 in the
pools against $13 for the field, consisting
of Iran Alto, Miss Jessie Claudius and
Hazel Kinney. In the opening heat Hazel
Kir.ney broke at the first turn. Dolly
Dillon on the back stretch and Miss Jes
sie, a 6 to 1 chance, with Charley Dunfee
driving, strolled in first ahead of Claudius
in 2:lo?4.
Hazel Kinney "Wakes Up.
The field now sold even tip against the
favorite. Saunders, behind the latter, took
things in a most unconcerned manner. As
a consequence. Hazel Kinney scored clev
erly at the wire with Dolly in second posi
tion. Betting remained about the same
and at the word Sanders sailed off in the
lead with the Santa Rosa Stock Farm en
try, winning the third heat all the way
In 2:14%. Hazel Kinney made a couple of
losing breaks on the way home, coming in
second.
Fetching 2 now against 6 for the entire
field. Dolly led Hazel Kinney Into the
stretch and looked to have the fourth
heat cinched, when she suddenly made a
"jimmy," permitting Hodges and his mare
to win easily. The others had ceased to
The fifth and final heat was a repetition
of the preceding heat, Dolly again going
to a break, losing out by nearly a dozen
lengths. The winner was superbly han
dled by her owner. P. W. Hodges, and like
the stakewinner claims McKinney as her
paternal parent.
A six-furlong dash for runners was next
decided. Torsida, a 4 to 1 chance, won
easily from Cowboy. Bamboulia, that
opened a 6 to 5 favorite, receding to 2^,
showed prominently for a way and thui
blew up.
To Jockev Johnny McDonald could un
doubtedly be charged up the loss of the
mile purse to the favorite, Snips. With
the race in hand he was seized with an at
tack of gayety to the last sixteenth, when
he was nipped and downed a long neck
by Mounce, on El Mido. Show honors
went to Grand Sachem.
The final six-furlong spin was character
ized by the closest finish of the entire
meeting. February, the" favorite. Flush o*
Gold and Asian finishing noses on tho
wire. The judges placed the latter colt,
first, though many thought the first choice
arrived in time. Â¦
Hobart Is Spilled.
In the forenoon Walter Hobart's team
of Blues were ignominlously beaten by
Tom DriscoH's Reds. 'the score standing 10
to 1 at the close of throe periods. The
game drew a large crowd and the rough
work was roundly appiauded. Early in
the game Walter Hobart received a hard
spill, spraining his ripht shoulder. He
pluckily continued through the game,
though unable to use his polo stick, re
sorting to blocking players of the oppo
site team. To offset the mishap, Captain
Drlscoll courteously had Charley Dunphy
lay aÂ«ide his stick. "Joe" Tobin, "Tom"
Drlscoll. "Dick" Tobin, Peter Martin,
Frank Carolan and M. E. Flowers, the
other players, took all sorts of
chances. The final game will be played
Saturdav next.
While galloping: Rio Chlco on the inside
track this morning Jockey Logue had a
narrow escape from death. He and his
mount were In collision with a sprinkling
cart, the boy being knocked out but not
seriously Injured, while the horse limped
away with a bruised shoulder.

XEW YORK, Sept. 10.â The stock market
maintained its waiting attitude to-day. The in
disposition to make any market commitments
was emphasized by the new uncertainties in the
outlook, particularly the postponement but not
the abandonment of the anthracite miners'
strike and the very meager news received up
to the time the market closed of the extent of
the disaster of the Texas hurricane. The wild
excitement in the cotton market diverted specu
lative Interest from stocks and caused some dls*
quiet, both by reason of the possible misfortune
which might attend such unbridled speculation
and the demands which were made on the
money market in order to carry the speculation.
The Texas storm caused positive depression
in the early dealings, but support was offered
in the important stocks affected as they ral
lied. The Kansas City Pouthem stocks were
raided sharply and lost 2@2V4. respectively, for
the common and preferred, and there was a
bear drive Induced by the recent liquidation
evident in the stocks and they recovered all
but half of the loss. The anthracite coalers
were favorably affected by the postponement of
the strike and Readlrtg first preferred and New
Jersey Central rose, respectively; 1 and 2 points
on small dealings. Professional operators are
steeped In the conviction that active specula
tion is waiting only the results of the pending
electoral contest and they covered short con
tracts to-day in the fear- that the Maine elec
tion might awaken the market into activity at
their expense. The resulting movement of
prices was generally very small and ragged.
The industrial specialties cased under recent
pressure, notably .Sugar. People's Gas and
i Brooklyn Transit. The furious speculation in
i cotton gives point to the bank statement and
arouses some renewed uneasiness as to the
ability of the money market to meet the pe
riod of fall strain upon it. Another sharp de
cline in sterling exchange, due to continued
heavy foreign demand for cotton, disposed of
any disposition that gold might go out to Eng
land this week, but the sub-treasury In the ab
sence of payments on account of gold deposited
at Pacific rw>lnts and for refunded bond pre
miums is beginning to absorb cash on account
of the revenue surplus.
The bond market continued quiet and Irreg
ular. Total sales, par value, $345,000.
U. S. refunding when issued advanced % and

Highly interesting and entertaining was
the first game of baseball on the Recrea
tion grounds yesterday and very few of
the fanatics were there to enjoy it. The
match between Dudes and Senators be
gan while the â¢â¢Semi-Centennial" was In
the throes of the paraCe, so the cham
pions and the tail enders played before
empty benches. Later on the crowd â
some of itâ found a resting place in the
prard stand and enjoyed the Stocktou
fcian Francisco game.
The Dudes a^id Senators produced real
thrills by scoring not at all until the sixth
inning. Then the ice was broken by the ]
Brum roels. Francks swatted out a two
bajcjrer and was placed safely on third
Â¦when Mat Stanley failed to stop the bali
back of the plate. Francks scored on
Moskirnan's hit. Then the game went
smilingly along without runs until tho
eighth, when the score was tied. Stultz
Trent to the initial bug: on a safe hit and
bunt work by â¢â¢Premier" Pitt that forced
poor throwing by the Dudes gave the
Senator a right to stay In the game.
The ninth ended the trouble. Bowman j
surprised everybody, even himself, by j
roiling out a two-bagger, being advanced
a b&M soon after by Held's sacrifice. Then
Mangerina hit to rianlon, who grew trem
ulous ar.d forgot to throw Bowman out
at the plate. Manieerina died, but Bow
man li~ed. He scored the winning run.
kloskbnan. who was on the slab for the
Dudes, proved very strong yesterday, the
champions finding- him but five times,
while IVvereaux wa? punished for ten
distinct hits. McLaughlin made another
star running catch, which was the feature
of the day. The score:

The Milk-rs never got near victory in the !
last game of the day. With but few hits j
end only two errors the "Pretzel-eaters"
and "Slcughmftn" dragged out a long
game, the silence of which was shattered
from time to time by the Stockton root
ers, who congregated on the b.eachers
and Fang a song about a lot of them not j
caring. :
Kr.f-il was the curve dispenser for Hank ]
and Harper for Harper. All the hits dur- |
inp the pame were well distributed. In
the second inning Pabst began the work
of victory for the local team, reaching
first on a hit. He stole second, went to
third on an out. and scored on a passed
tiall. The fourth inning was the most
fruitful of all, causing the boy at the bell
to pull the cord twice. Hildebrand and

NEW YORK, Sent. 10.â The Intensity of ex
citement and activity of speculation on the
Cotton Exchange to-day was without parallel.
Fluctuations far exceeded anything hitherto
recorded, the extremes being a hundred points
Â¦with relapses freauent and violent. The mar
ket opened irregular and excited with nrices
43@61 points higher on an Irresistible rush of
buying in which every branch of the trade took
part. Sellers were few and far between and with
out exception were parties having heavy profits
within reach. Many of these immediately took
the bull side again and were still long at the
close to-nicht. Following the call the market
sep-sa-.ved at a breath-taking rate, with the
movement In the main generally swinging to
ward higher prices. As the morning pro
ceeded speculation broadened until the mar
ket was beyond the control of the bulls even.
Sensational setbacks followed nerve-trying
bulges, which kept operators, of no matter
what belief. Jumping to keep pace. The Eng
lish Â¦ market showed corresponding gyrations
and private cables denoted complete chaos in
Liverpool. The bulls, however, were being car
ried alone by the advance. On the local ex
change September sold up to l(%c, as against
Hie Saturday night.
The best level of the later months was;-5@7
i>oints above Saturday's figures. The founda
tion of bull ideas and the chief cause of the
terrific bull speculation was the news that
the best section of the crop had been swept
by a tropical storm, the equal of which was
not known. Reports from Central Texas were
vazue and totally unsatisfactory, which fact
tended to increase the fears of shorts and
the big crop theorists In general. Liverpool
was similarly influenced, as well as the New
Orleans market. Estimates pointing to a loss
of 750.0000 to 1.000.000 bales and the announce
ment that spot cotton was In enormous de
mand south at %K*ic higher prices intensified
the conviction of the boars. The Government
report for September, usually (he most Impor
tant of the season, cut comparatively little fig
ure as an Influence. The general condition
was given at 68.2 as ag.tlnst 76 last month,
6S.5 in September last year. 79.8 in 1898 and 78.3
In 1597. This average included 77 for Texas, as
contrasted with 83 on August 10 and 81 on
September 10 of last year. At 12.45 p. m. the
failures of T. G. Schlfter and Gay I. SchifTer
were announced, these brokers being caught
short by the opening rise. The, announcement
of their suspension did not seriously disturb
the market, as they were known to have unim
portant, obligations outstanding.
The bull fever reached its height about noon
and under a flurry of profit-taking near the
close prices settled, back a few points. The
close was irregular and excited with prices
net 40Â®RO points higher. . :
Estimates placed the total transactions at
l.SJiO.OOO bales or 150,000 more than ever before
recorded. ________

of Spain as an American power is now
complete. Yet but a short century aRÂ°
she held in America an empire by the
side of which the territory of the United

remnant of this vast imperial claim is

But these early exploits of the English
were not so effective as a basis of pos
session as were the operations of British
fur traders and trappers. It is the trader
that haa blazed the way for the advancing
frontier. The Hudsons Bay Company,
which has dotted with Its trading post*
the Immense regions between the two
oceans from the United States to the Arc
tic Sea. was chartered by Charles II ire
1670. This charter Incorporated the "Gov
ernor and Company of Adventurers Trad
ing Into the Hudsons Bay." with exc'usKo
trade rights in all the lands drained by tha
waters of that bay; It granted, also, "thn
whole and entire trade and traffic to ami
from the havens, bays, creeks, rivers,
lakes and seas into which they shall find
entrance by water or land." In 1749 th<>
company almost forfeited Its rights by
"non user." In fact, for more than 150
years, approximately from 1608 to 17BS. lit
tle exploration and settlement of tho vast
West was attempted. After the cession
of Canada to Great Britain (1763) numbers
of fur traders spread over the western
part of the continent. The Northwest
Fur Company of Montreal, of which Irv
ing writes In his "Astoria," carried on a
fierce competition with the Hudson,
company, and it was with these trading
companies and their interests that we
had our chief difficulty in establishing our
claims to the valley of the Columria and
the Northwest. The voyages of Cook
(1776-S) and of Vancouver (1791>. both of
whom made explorations on the North
west coast, were also used as a further
basis for English claims. Contemporary
with Vancouver our American Captain
Gray discovered the Columbia Riverâ a
discovery that materially aided our
claims to the Oregon country.
But it is not with the counter claims or
the rival nations, nor with the work or
their earliest explorers, seamen and trap
pers in the West, that th!s account haÂ»
chiefly to do. It Is to the American pio
neers and pathfinders of the nineteenth
century who revealed to their country
men the passes of the great mountains
and made possible American possession of

The grand bail given by Stanford Parlor
at Golden Gate Hall last night was a brill
iant affair in every detail. The hall was
beautifully decorated in the jubliee colors,
the prevailing materials being satin, silk
and gold embroidery. On the stage was a
huge setting sun in electric lights, sur
rounded by thirty-one stars, representing
the number of States in the Union after
California was admitted. In the center
of the hall was a hanging basket made
; of 500 white and yellow chrysanthemums,
i Six hundred lights were used in the dec
; orations and the electrical effects during
the dancing caused genuine admiration.
The decorations were the work of A. F.
Schleicher, one of the members of the
parlor.
The grand march began at 10 o'clock
and was led by William F. Humphrey,
president of the parlor, and Miss Hum
phrey, followed by 230 couples. The ladies
were tastefully gowned and the gentlemen
i in evening dress, relieved by the uniforms
worn by the members of the parlor and
i adopted for the celebration. A fine pro
; gramme of dances to the music of a string
Â¦ orchestra was enjoyed. During an inter
! mission the guests adjourned to the ban-
hall, where a light repast was
!. Served. The upp^r hall was then opened
for the accommodation of the guests, the
number of which had greatly increased
j during the evening. Dancing was then
' continued until early morning and another
i successful "Stanford affair" came to an
| end.
Ball at Stanford Parlor.
Over 3000 invitations had been sent out
and nearly one-half that number respond
ed. Among the invited were the Governor
and staff. Mayor Phelan and members of
the city government, many Pioneers and
all the grand officers of the Native Sons
and Daughters of this city. To-day the
parlor will have an excursion to Mare Isl
and, and at midnight will start for home.
Stockton Parlor is the fecond largest in
the State, and it is also one of the rich
est, having some $12,000 in its treasury. It
was organized March 12, 1SS1, and reor
ganized in 18S3.
On .board the steamer H. J. Corcoran
the jolly members of Stockton Parlor No.
7 received their friends from 3 to 6 o'clock
yesterday afternoon. The Stockton boys
chartered the Corcoran especially for the
occasion, and while here their headquar
ters are in the big steamer.
About 250 Sons came down besides sixty
Native Daughters. The steamer is gayly
decorated both inside and out t\nd she pre
sented a pretty spectacle as she steamed
into the bay Sunday night, ablaze with col
ored lights. In addition to the large con
tingent of Stccktonites who came in the
steamer it is estimated that fully. 3000
came by rail to share in the celebration.
The receiving committee consisted of
Messrs. Wurster, Knowles, O'Connor and
LJeginger. The parlor's own band fur
nished music for the reception and light
refreshments were served.

The "facts which lc-akod out were to the

and the members of the party would ex

c ->ur.e<Jvitch and thirty other Russians I
: re held there by the military authorities I
to answer to serious charges, the out- !
come of which may lead to International j
complications between the United States j
end Russia.
The Russians were arrested on the j
corcplalnt of George D. Roberts and six I
ottur Americans, the prisoners and ccra- ,
plainants having been members of the i
Roberts expeditions from Ban Francisco, j
which reached Nome in June and started ;
August 9 for Siberia, on board the steam- ;
ship Samoa. The Russians are charged Â¦
with plotting to conduct the seven Aoer- i
Ic&ns to a. desolate point Inland from the j
Siberian coast, and there murder them, j
or. as an alternative, to maroon them at !
some point on the Siberian coast remote *
from settlement. Then, it is said, the j
RufaElans proposed to take advantage of i
the objects for which the expedition was i
organized, afterward returning iÂ» ihe
cciiFt and taking departure in the Samoa
for anywlit-it but a:i American port.
The "Sainoa left NomÂ« with men and [
material for the operation of a mining â¢
concession in Russian territory, held by j
a. syndicate of English capitalists. Th--* j
expedition was in charge of Roberts ar.d .
he had associated with him the Russian
engineer. Dadouriedviteh. The fcrce in- â¢
eluded thirty Ruffians, who had been en- â¢
gapvd as laborers, and six Americans.
Shortly after the vestei put to sea the
thirty laborers began lo act in a manner ;
that aroused the suspicion of the Ameri- I
tans and the uneasiness was 'augmented j
by the alleged discovery that the Ruj- ;
liars', with the exception of u.e civil en
gineer, were all Cossack soldiers. Roberts
put a watch ujmn them and soon learned
of a pi r >t to i=eize the vessel and maroon
or murder the Americans.
Roberta quickly formed the plan of ac
tion that was subsequently carried out.
A r.ipl.t or two Â»fter the discovery of the
plot the Americans managed to get on
fleck together, while all the Russians save
twrt were in their bunks. These two were j
quietly overpowered, sagged and left un- Â¦

to get control of the fiiearms and ammu- ;
dtlon on board the ship. The direction
cf the vessel was at once reversed and
phÂ«^ was headed back lor Nome.
The two Russians were then released i
and when they had awakened their coun- '
trymen there was a great uproar, all pro- Â¦

everything that Mr. and Mrs. Baer wiil
need in the way of spoons, forks, knives,
carvers and oft pieces, during their lives.
The plate on top of the chest bears the
following Inscription:
"From Uncle William and Aunt Ida,
September 12. 1900."
Other presents received by the bride in
clude a generous supply of brilliant Jew
els, a bewildering assortment in silver and
cut-glass tableware, chinaware, table
linen, paintings, engravings and numerous
other articles of household, and personal
adornment.
Stops were also made en route at Han
cock, Meyersdale, Rockwood and Martlns
burg, where the President- shook hands
with as many of the assembled guests as
he could reach during the few moments
the stops were made.
President and Mrs. McKinley and Mrs.
Catherine Matthews were upon their ar
rival driven at once to Abner McKinley's
home.
"My fellow-citizens: I assure you that
this la very unexpected by me. I had no
idea that so many of my fellow-citizens
of Cumberland would assemble here to
give such cordial greetings in the moment
that I stop with them. I am glad to know
that no matter what be our politics we
are all for the United States â all for the
dear flag where it floats, and determined,
the North and the South, to stand by the
brave soldiers and sailors who are main
taining our standard in our distant ter
ritory and giving shelter and protection
to American citizens in China, I thank
you once again for this generous greet
ing."
A great and altogether unexpected dem
onstration greeted President McKinley
upon his arrival at Cumberland this after
noon. Although it was generally known
that his train would make but a short
stop, an immense crowd was at the sta
tion. He Intended to mane no speeches
on the journey to Somerset, but the gath
ering was so enthusiastic that after re
peated calls he linally responded as fol
lows:
Tho Presldental party was met at the
Somerset station by Mr. . and Mrs. Mc-
Kinley and Dr. Herminus L. Baer, the
groom. A shout went up from the assem
bled crowd as Mr. and Mrs. McKinley
made their appearance on the platform of
the rear coach and descended the car
steps. The President and Mrs. McKinley
bowe<J their acknowledgments. President
McKinley looked to be in unusually good
health. It was announced that the Presi
dent would devote hia time ; to absolute
rest while here. .â¢ '? ;!
SOMERSET, Pa., Sept. 10.â The Presi
dent and party arrived here over the Bal
timore and Ohio Railroad at 5:30 o'clock
this afternoon to be present at "the wed
ding of Miss Mabel McKinley, the Presi

on Wednesday. The party were: Mr. and
Mrs. McKinley, Mrs. Catherine Matthews
of Washington (sister of Mrs. Abner Mc-
Kinley), Secretary to the President G. B.
Cortelyou. Dr. P. M. Rixey (medical in
spector of the navy and the President's

Had Intended Making No Speeches

had been picked up along the water front.
The physicians say that the wounds must
have been produced by some blunt Iron
Instrument, but as Lind was badly Intox
icated he was not able to tell what hap
pened to him.
A man known about the water front as

was jig and reel dancing for prizes and
ballroom dances in tho big pavilion for
those who desired. In the amphitheater
there were races for old. voung and mid

their prowess, the winners also carrying
off trophies of their success.
In all there were forty athletic events,
over -which Father Quinn presided with
such good judgment and fairness as to
please all of the contestants. Fifty Kale
prizes were Ri\ r en to the holders of win

Skull Fractured.
He first came into prominence about a
quarter of a century ago. when he got
away with the celebrated paintinK
"Elaine," which was on exhibition on
Kearny street in this city. A short
time afterward Lees, at that time Chief of
Detectives. arrested Wallace for the
crime. While having his preliminary ex
amination he climbed out of a courtroom
window and, sliding down a water pipe,
made his escape. A short time afterward,
while visiting Cincinnati. Lees recognized
Wallace while on the streets and caused
his arrest. He was brought back to this
city and subsequently tried and sentenced
to ten years In San Quentin. After his dis
charge he went to Oregon, where he was
arrested and sentenced to five years' Im
prisonment for burglary.
According to the police Wallace is one
of the most successful crooks that ever
operated in the United States. On learn
ing that he was in this city, evidently pre
pared to commit crime. Captain Seymour
lost no time in having him locked up.
Frank Randall and Charles Drew, noted
Eastern pickpockets, were arrested yes
terday on Market street by Detectives
Dlnan and Wren. They were seen in the
act of trying to pick a woman's pocket.
After being taken into custody Randall
tried to dispose of a bottle of "knockout
drops" which he had in his possession.
Although now gray-haired and old, Wal
lace Is still feared by the police. He Is
known In every State In the Union as a
desperate crook and as soon as he is rec
ognized he is thrown in jail or ordered to
leave town.
"Tommy" Wallace, one of the most no
torious crooks in the country. Is locked
up in the tanks in the City Prison. He
was arrested by order of Captain Sey
mour, who learned that he was in the
city and suspected that he was bent on
mischief. â¢ Yesterday he was found on
Market street and locked up In the tanks.
He will be held until the celebration is
over.

Ryan's illness is due to a bowel and
stomach affection from which he has suf
fered during- the last five days. The first
symptoms appeared last Thursday, but a
day's relaxation from training engendered
In the mind of the pugilist a false belief
that he had thrown olf the temporary
Illness and waÂ« so far recovered as to be
able to continue his work. Since Satur
day Ryan has been forced to discontinue
his training altogether. The same com
plaint left Ityan in a very weak condition
the nipht he foug-ht Green in this city.
"I don't want to take any chances." said
Ryan last night. "I want to be strong
and in good condition when I meet Mof
fatt. Of course I might fight him and. if
things went r gainst me. have an excuse.
But this 1 don't care for. I am very
fcorry that this has happened. I shall be
in San Francisco for some time and hope
the date can be satisfactorily postponed
I lose by this my $.")00 forfeit and the ex
penses of training."
The National Club is in a quandary
over the unexpected turn in events. The
fight was the talk of the sporting public
and a big crowd was assured. Al Neill
wants to go on in Ryan's place and the
National Club looks to the loser of two
fights against Moffatt as a saving straw.
Neill has been in training for a San Jose
tisrht and claims to be in fzoo<i' condition.
It is most likely that Neil! will be sub
stituted for Ryan Wednesday night. Â¦ Â¦
Jack Welch, the well known referee,
and J. J. Groom of the National Club
were discussing ths withdrawal of Ryan
last nipht and blows resulted. Groom in
sinuated that Ryan felt a "chill in his
pedalers." Welch would not listen to it
?jid Groom was a target for the referee's
fist.
Tommy Ryan is 111â so ill that he can't
see how it would be possible to do him
celf Justice by fighting Jack Moffatt on
Wednesday night. Determined not to
take any chances he notified the managers
of th<* National Atheltic Club yesterday
afternoon that he would not be in condi
tion to meet Jack Moffatt on September
12. He is willing to fight Moffatt as soon
as no has recovered from his attack of
sickness which lias left him in a very
weakened condition.

The military drama.. "The Girl I Left
Behind Me." drew a crowded house to the
Alcazar theater last night, extra seating
capacity beinp required. The plot is well
known. Two officers are In love with the
General's daughter, one being a villain
end the other a hero. The villain is un
masked and the hero weds the grirl. There
are some 6tirring- scenes in the four acts
and the audience last night was wildly
enthusiastic. Howard Hail as the hero.
Lieutenant Hawkesworth. came In for the
largest share of the applause and he de
e?r\-ed it. Clarence Montaine as Major
Burleigh was not far behind In the good
graces of the audience and Howard Scott
es the General and Edwin T. Emery as
Dr. Penwick were satisfactory. George
P. Webster as the villain was hissed re
peatedly, which was what pleased him.
Charles Bryant as Scar Brow, Carlyle
Moore es Private Jonos and Bert Yo'ung
bs Serpeant Dix played their parts well.
Miss Dorothy Dorr as Kate Kennlon, the
General's daughter, gave on the whole a
satisfactory interpretation of the part and
Miss Lorena Atwood as Lucy Hawkes
worth was really excellent. Miss Polly
Stockwell as Wllbers Ann was flatterlnsrly
received.
TFIAT Mr. Clement should have to
fall back upon "The New Dominion"
for Ills second week argues either an
extraordinary lack of new plays or
an extraordinary lack of enterprise on his
part. Let us hope It Is the former: in
that case the revival of hJs now ancient
comedy has excuse which otherwise ii
would be hard to grant.
Much of the drairatlc material in this
play is thin and threadbare; the mortgage.
the gin that loved not wisely but too well,
the heavy vi'lain adorned with top bools
*â¢â¢)<! ridinp whip, the comic relief furn
ished by the dashing widow and the young
society swellâ we know them all aa well
Â£s v;e know the cigar store Indian whom
vre pass on our daily walk to the office.
Â£a:ff a.r^ they, stiff and conventional ad
he. but among these lay figures moves the
rc-a!]y human form of the delightful
Baron von Hohenstauffen, the large heart
ed German botanist who comes for ten
days to investigate the flowers of Vir
ginia, but who stays the entire summer
that he may carry oft the fairest Flora
of them all. This character study is a
real contribution to our scanty clrj.ma.tic
literature and Mr. Clement has thought
out the rendition so thoroughly that he is
convincing from the moment he stops on
the etape till the moment he leaves It.
There are not half a dozen actors in the
United States who can write their own
play.Â«. Mr. Clement is one of these. He
would be far better employed in studying
t-ome other of the numerous types in
â¢which our society abounds than in wan
dering to the Antipodes in support of
third-rate tragediennes or revamping ill
cor.structed melodramas.
The two most charming scenes In "The
New Dominion" are the German lesson
and the fiower speech. The former Is con
ceived in the true spirit of comedy, the
latter of poetry. It is to be regretted that
Mr. Clement, misencouraeed by the hilar
ity of an enthusiastic audience, allowed
his comedy at times to fall into farce. In
the flower-E]x-ech scene Miss Pomphret
was a gTeat improvement on the young
lady Â¦who last year eat out the poetry
like "pray-halred Saturn, silent as a
Ftor.e"; yet Miss Pomphret, evidently by
instruction, turned her back to the audi
ence during the times of most tense emo
tion, so that we could not tell whether
she was moved by the speech or not. That
is not pood, either. Is it impossible to get
this scene, the gem of the play, played
for all It is worth?

L&Ft evening for the first time In the
