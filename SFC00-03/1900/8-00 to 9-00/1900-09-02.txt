James Anthony died in this city Janu

founder of that paper. He worked at
Rattlesnake bar in 1849 and near Wolse.ys
Flat. Nevada County, in 1S31 and the for*
part of 1S52: and then went to Sacra
mento, where he entered the employ of .
William W. Kurtz and E. G. Jefferis. then
the publishers of the Sacramento Union,
as bookkeeper. .
The parties owning the paper were ex-.
cellent journeyman printers, but wholly.,
unfitted for editorial work. There was a
paper then railed the Democratic State
Journal, and another railed t'.ie Placer
Times, owned by Benjamin F. Washing
ton. The entire patronage ol all the Stato
offices was thm thrown to the Journal,
and Kurtz and JerTeris J;aÂ«l an uphill j&b
of It. The foreman was Paul Morrill. a
New York printer, with Henry XT. Lar
kin and Jerrmiah dray, also prominent
in the typographical department of the
paper. Larkin and Morrill bought out
Jefferis ar.d the Kurtz interest was sold
to Anthony, who appeared as the head of
the firm. For some tlm* most of the edi
torials were written by Dr. John F.
Morse, also a passenger on the Hum
boldt; but In 1863 they secured the ser
vices of Lauren Upson as editor and chief
writer.
The paper was finally sold to Henry S.
Crocker.

GOI.T.IS P. HUNTINGTOX came to
California as a steerage passenger
on board the ship Humbolrtt. He
died the other day leaving an
estate of J50.O0O.O00.
It was in 1S19 that the California fever
Feized him. He was 23 years eld then
and he was poor. He thought it was
time to be doing something.
Up to LS43 he had been making both ends
.meet in a modest little way over the
counter of a New York country store.
Cineoma was the town where he had set
up business with his brother. It la re
ported that he was called "promising.*"
Nobody knows what he thought of talm
felf. However, the woodpile story gives
a bit of a hint.
He was a youngster when the woodpile
Etory happened. He was living on the
Connecticut farm then, where his father
made a decent living. It was not big
enough, however, to give young Collis
much pocket money ard he looked about
to see where he could earn some f;>r him
felf.
Or.e of the neighbors wanted sonie wood
Fi!ed. "Let me bare the Job." Collis s&i-i.
He piled wocd just as well a.s he built
railroads.
When he was through he did not ask
where to find the broom, but hunted it.
Â¦up for himself. He. swept the chips and
rubbish out of the shed and left the whols"
buHding as neat as a kitchen on scrub
bing day. Then he called to the passing
ewr.er and asked if all w.is satisfactory.

The riovol Itself has been called by trm
translator "a poet's story of his people's
loves, faults, asnirations and wrnnpa."
The author. r*rv Rfznl. was, perhaps. thÂ»
most remarkable Filipino of his time.
lie spent several years of his life in Eu
rope. In Madrid, while only Cl years of
aue. he won the decrees of Ph.r>. and
it D. He |hen went tr> Germanv and
studied in what was to him a new lan
guage-taking another degree. Then hts
travels took him to Austria, an" here hÂ«
became famous as an oculist. He wan
dered through France. Italy and England,
abrorbincr the literatures of the different
countries and lcavinar behind him no little
reputation as a sculptor. With such Eu
ropean training as this he began to write
regarding his own country, and shortly
achieved real literary distinction. Re
turning to hia native land, he was Im
prisoned, then exiled, being set free to
take up service as a surgeon fn Cuba.
Here he. was foully murdered by the>
Spaniards. Of his life and Felf-saerlflelnET
struggles for his country little is known
in this country, but this novel which la
now published will Illustrate in a manner
the figure that -was implied in the title.
Rlzal was a reformer who flew an eagle
flight, bold and forth on. leaving no track
behind of his patriotic labors. The pres
ent story is perhaps his best work. and.
that it has unusual strength may be
judged from the fact that competent
critics have called it the "Uncle Tom'a
Cabin" of the Philippines.

mice, notably the water shrew.
Arannj the indifferent' niviir.mers of this

Many observers are of the opinion that
the squirrel do* s not swim at all, but that
by hopping: on to a floating piece of baric
and using Ms tail as a nil he crosses tha
widest rivers. This Is a very pretty story
and one with a certain amount of truth
in It (I have myself seen squirrels float
ir.jr down streams in this way), but that
he often attains his object thus I very.
much doubt.
Twi.^e, while fishing in the Tay, I saw
squirrels' actually .swimming across tha
fiver, and their movements struck me as
ro peculiar that I afterward experimented,
with, them in ths water. They were evi
dently "alarihed at the thought of trusting
themselves to so treacherous an element,

One night when the local officials of the
small village where we were stopping
called, according to custom, to greet us
and arrange for future progress one of
them, a dear old gentleman, who had a
laugh that would have made hla fortune
on~ the stage in any capital of Europe,
inquired, what land I came from, if It
was far from China, and then, whether I
came by land or sea., each question being
punctuated by. a delicious laugh. To tell
him. who considered 100 miles as a long
Journey, that I had come over 10,000 mile*
was to give the impression of a gross ex
aggeration, as he had no IdÂ«a of the size
of the earth- or where America was. as thu
question whether it was north or south ot
China indicated". One of his companions,
finding that his'.- friend .was quite at sea.
finally summoned up courage and rebuked
the.ques'tloner by pointing out that Amer.
ica was in the Western and China in thÂ«
Kasfern Hemisphere. After other Inquir
ies the first man brightened up and said:
"Oh, I know now where your land is; It
la between France and Germany*?; where
upon the second, who had been carefully
watching our faces and so perceived that

But those dancing days are over for
California. The â¢â¢Gringos" do not make
pleasure the buslnes.- of life. Only tho
descendants of th* Cslifornians dance as
did the youth of the halcyon days when
life, was one round of fiestas and fan
dangos.
The Califbrnians thought nothing of rid
ing miles to a fandango- or private dance.
Often a party would ride three days to a
house, feast for three days and nights and
mount their horse* for home, considering
the, fun well worth the necessary tlresoma
riding. ; . f Â¦ . â¢ ' .'. ; . Â¦
The most charming and graceful of
;these dances was the contradanza. The
figures were many of them borrowed from
other dances and so had the most attrac
tive movements of them all. at the samo
time having individual charms.
Perhaps the most graceful and interest
li)S dances were those In which a large
number participated. The figures were in
tricate and required more grace and Indi
vidual dexterity than la necessary for the
modern "german." The Spanish dances
were all life and mo\-ement, the gay attlra
giving a vivid splash of color to the whole.
Another dance called "el son" was per
formed by or.e person only. The sound of
Utef.jTect was part of th* music. Lad!e3
especially excelled In this dance, and when
particularly well executed it caused much
enthusiasm. If the gentleman spectators
were relatives or Intimate friends ths
f'ahcer was often showered with silver
dollars, which she would laughingly toss
and catch for a grand finale. Now and
then a particularly graceful dancer would
receive a golden doubloon among the sil
ver: If a cavalier placed his sombrero ort
the head of a lady dancing "el son" it
served as a pledge -which he would redeem
with a present. :

their hearts' content and the padre's
chagrin.
But the padre held a trump card, which
he straightway played. He had procured
an edict from the Bishop of Sonora im
posing the punishment of excommunica
tion upon any person who should commit
po heinous an offence as to dance the
waltz either In private or public. The
padre pasted the edict on the door of the
church where all might read on their way
home from the bu'.lfisht.
Down the street they came, bewitch
ing maidens and pay cavaliers, duennas
liringis:g up the rear. Santa Maria! what's
this eo glaring white on the old church
door? "Excommunicated:" That word
struck terror to the girls and doubt to the
most daring- youth.
There was an unlsual flutter and stir m
the house of Don Jose that night.
"Maria Santissima! She will not dare!"
said the ladies in frightened whisper?.
Wager? ran high among the men. For
Carmcnita Castro has declared that after
the "el jarnbe" is danced she will brave
the Rishop and dance the waltz.
Now the rattle of the jarabe Is over.
Carmer.ita Castro, with a sml!e on her
llus and r. challenge in her eyes, took the
center of the floor. "A waltz," she com
manded. 4 "Comc," she cried, "who' will
dance witfl me? So I must beg a partner.
Come, come. You are brave- cavaliers, are
you not? â¢ Come; Ferdinando, you who
threw Juan last Santa Semana. What,
Don Ferdinado knows fear! Jose, you!
Pedro, you! Carlosâ not one will dance
with Carmencita Castro! Then I shall
waltz by myself. Carmencita Castro does
not break her word. Play!"
The guests were horrified. How dared
Carmencita Castro dance In the face of
the terrible edict. Every step -would bring
her nearer the gates of hades. "Play!"
she commanded again to the horrified
musicians..
Suddenly some one slid out of the line
of men who were -fringing the walls. It Is
the noble Governor Arguello. Is he going
to call down the wrath of the good God
on her head? The smile froze on Carmen
clta's lips and her arms dropped limply to'
her side. The Governor advanced to with
in a few feet of Carmencita, and bowing
almost to the glound said: . Â¦
"Senorlta, I am neither a bishop nor an
archbishop. But did I know how to waltz.
I should certainly waltz as' much as I
pleased!" . ' " ' â¢ _ â¢
That took off the curse. The Governor
had spoken. They fell to- waltzing, and
they and their descendants have been
waltzing ever sir.ee. After such ail opinion
from the lips of the Governor the bishops
and padres discreetly removed the â¢â¢ ban
from waltzing. :
Perhaps the fandango was the most typ-
leal California dance. But. there were
many others : equally popular.: "El jarabe'*
was a dance .performed, by a lady arid a
gentleman.-. The gentleman usually wore
his sefmbrero. while the lady- half-revealed,

to show the silken sheen of dainty ankles.

visitor at White Sulphur Springs. The
commodore could out-Chesterfield . Ueau
Brummel and was extremely fond of
dancing the minuet and courtly waltzes,
which he danced with all ceremony, hold
ing his partner at arm's length, circling
round and round the room in the three

When dancing grew wearisome, there
was always room for one more In the ad
joining parlor, where card games, gay or
absorbing, held sway. A favorite diver
sion was to cry "bat!" and Immediately
Mrs. Governor Johnson would gather up
her skirts and fly. Bats occasionally flew
in through the open window, and some
one had told Mrs. Johnson that bats had
a particular penchant for ladies' tresses.
Mrs. Johnson had very beautiful hair,
which she wore in flowing ringlets. â¢
On Sunday the guests assembled 'in the
parlor, where General Joshua Haven read
from a volume of quaint but wholesome
old sermons. In the evening there was al>
a bowling alley, shootingâ before the. heat
of summer dried up the watercourses â
riding and driving. After dinner the chalra
and tables were pushed back, the. violinist
nnd harpist mounted r table, and presto,
change! -A ballroom was made while you
waited. Saturday night was the great
night, for most of the city beaux came up
. to stay over Sunday.
John Wise carried off the honors of the
ballroom one j season. 'â¢ He literally won
out "at a walk." Noticing one of the
elderly ladies drooping among the wall
flowers, out of kindness of heart he asked
her to take a promenade around tho ball
room. She Responded with alacrity and
proved too much of a sprinter for Wise,
who finally .exhausted from the number,
of "turns" and the heat of the evening,
suggested that, she might like to sit down.
"No, sir," replied the dame. "I haven't
had any exercise for several days and
I'm going to make up 'for It to-night!"
Naturally Mr. .Wise did not play the phil

An incident r,f ten told by those who
made yearly Ttetta ta White Sulphur .
SprlOSS clearly shows how thoroughly
congenial the guests were. An English
man stopped thero at nightfall From thÂ©
general appearance of the place he Judged
it was a hotel, but the hearty greeting of
the host was so unlike that of thÂ« usual
landlord that he came to the conclusion
that he waa a CaSlfornian entertaining: h!Â»
friends in the lavish manner native to
the soil- The Englishman was madÂ© to
feel perfectly at home by the guests and
departed on the morrow. Ho merely
thanked the landlord profusely, hoped
that some day he would he able to return
the- compliment and. swinging tnto fcla
saddle, was off. :.
A handsome pipe sent later to the land
lord from England proved how sincere
was- the Englishman's grattturto and how
entirely he had mistaken the character of
this: place. This one Incident tells the
whole story. It is the keynote to the life
at White Sulphur Springs. '::; '-?. Â¦Â¦ '.
The years have brought their charges

bar. He had been a frontier preacher, but
religion was dull in Hangtown; so he
became bar-teinler at tho El Dorado
Hotel. He watched the door for Charley
with the air of expectancy. For since his
admission to the bar, he had developed a
taste for exciting Incidents When Charley
entered and lounged toward the bar. Jim's
face lit up. He knew that something was
going to happen.
The crowd had assembled in the large
room that answered for the hotel ofllce.

"Xo gal could look like that at me and
get led awav from me," said Texas Jim
as he relied the barrel back to Its place
on the porch. "And she needs a friend
now that Ramon is detid," he added as he
gave his suspenderless pants a character
istic hitch and went in.
"Adios. aenor." and with the air of pro
prietorship he led his daughter over to
John Folsom. who then took the pro
prietary role, and with Claxessa's arm in
his they followed the crowd into the hotel,
old Carlns acting as the rear guard.
Cut Ma-riueJ. the ever watchful, had
taken In the situation from his point of
vantage, and Just as Charley reached
Claressa's side Manuel came up abreast

who live near to nature's heart, he Inter

his heart courageâ for "he had long loved

was more expressive than ati audiblo

Charley's hand trembled when he weighed
out the gold dust to pay for the drinks.
â¢ Then Charley famed a.nd looked at Fol
som as one might look at an unworthy
rival, l.ong ami carefully he looked from
his polished shoes to his high hat. Then
he drew: nearer and looked, and finally.
ss though held by some terrible fascina

"You?" said Charley ; in a voice that
sounded vacant and far away. \ "ToÂ«?
IIow dare you?" ; Then he turned to the
miners who stood rooted to the spot txn
der the spell of Charley's panther-like ad
vance on Folsom.
"Boys,": said Charley in a voice that
was how well under control.; "this man
killed Ramon Pachecco. Xw he claims
Ramon's sister for his bride."
"You want her. yourself," said the gen

Jim felt he was discharging a solemn
duty when he leaned : forward and
smashed the high hat down over Folsom'a
mouth.
"You are in the presence of a lady,"
said this spiritual mimonisher as he
folded hia arms and ( watched for further
developments.
The miners had withdrawn to the door,
where they found a human barricade.
and held a private consultation. Old
Carlos Pachecco's fare was a study. His
was not a soul of instant adjustment. It
was hard for him to face the fact that
the one American he loved was thÂ« one
whom he should most hate. Horror was
written on Claressa's face, but Texas Jim
did not fail to note that through the hor
ror a relieved Ux>k shone In her eyes.
"Carlos." cried the infuriated, bllnd
foHed Folsom, trying to see. Claresisa
took her father's hand lovingly. They
could now by a common bond hate this
American together.
"Claressa," called Folscm, as ho groped
helplessly to find her. The atmos

was heard and a frw commands ex

?'Oh. Claressa." criod Folsom aeain. for
he felt that the good things of this. Ufa
were fast receding from him.
The minors advanced toward him in a
business-like manner, but they stopped
midway. Clarissa again held their atten

"The next thing I* did was to put my
foot in it. I thought I knew something
about old California customs, and so I
launched a question about the fandango.
"Fandangro!" And all that was Spanish
in fclm and all that was aristocratic
matter what the circumstances of meet
ing. For the stranger on the street there
Â¦was a blessinc. For the traveler thero
was 'the house is yours.' For any beggar
â¢who happened toÂ» ask for food at this
door there was a meal served by the
mistress herself, with her very best china
and silver, and if perchance he should
misplace a spoon or two, why then one
would say. 'Oh. well, what of it?' That ;s
another difference; people of the present
are less hospitable with their silver. I
remember hearing of a party at General
\ allejo's house where the guests were in
vited to help themselves to all the gold
nuggets In a drawer. One is so scrupu
lous nowadays.
Monterey before Its play cay had yet quite
faced. I â¢â¢'asked her once how she could
enjoy bu'.l fterhts.
'"Do you not pro to a football game every
Thanksgiving?" t-he replied. "And at that
pamc are not men hurt instead of bulls?
Do. you not even flourish a red rag your
eolf 16 help on the battle?
"She used to go with her father to the
hull fight every Sunday afternoon, and
after it came the acrobats, and then she
had to co to her catechism. She liked
the bull fights best. By the time the
catechism began she was looking forward
to next Sunday's fight. â¢â¢Â¦/Â¦Â¦.
"But nowadays Sunday Is very dull in
Monterey," says Senor Gomez. "One
Â¦walks along the Ftreet and sees no gayety
and hears no music. Strangers do not bid
-one good-day as they once did. It seems
?o me unfriendly to pass without a word;
but it is your custom.
"Every one was every one's friend, no
pulled him up tall and straight. "Tho
fandangos were what you call public
balls," he said. "Dances given to invited
guests at private â¢ houses -were not fan
dangos."
iWhen Don Juan gallop3 away on his old
wooden stool to a Monterey dance ht nkes
especially to go to one at the home of
Governor Alvarado. -
"I remember him as Governor "when I
was a little boy," ho says. "He lived in
the big house that everybody admired.
It was a two-story, building, and that
made it something of a sight in old Mon
terey, i
"The first floor was used for the every
day living rooms of the family. Upstairs
>-as a great parlor where dances yere
held. Any Kind or a party was a dance
in those days. We did not have dinners
and luncheons* and teas as you do nowâ
everybody wanted to dance, everybody,
whether young or old. And such dancers
as the Spanish were!"
When Senor Gomez poes to a party at
Governor Alvarado's he is no longer an
eld man. but a little boy whose father-,
takes him along on his own 'good horse.
He is porgeously dressed and his hair is
cropped short because thus did Alvarado
himself set the fashion when he was a
little boy and had his own hair cropped,
he said, that his mother might have less
trouble vith it. He did not dwell upon
the fact that he wanted short hair him
self. And yet it seems not to have oc
curred to any one then that he would one
day become Governor.
"Alvarado was a moat delightful host."
says Don Juan. "He was as fond of pleas
ure as any. man I ever Knew, and fca
nrro &a they did. They used to trifTo

WHEAT BLOCKADE IN
SANTA FE YARDS
Company TJnable to Provide Motive-
Power to Carry Away the
Vast Shipments.
KANSAS CITY. Sept. 1.â Ths extenslva
yards of the Santa Fe Railroad in Argen
tine are almost exclusively occupied with
cars of wheat, which It Is Impossible to
move. It was estimated that there were
twenty miles of wheat cars there this
morning. The trouble is said to be due to
the Inability of the Chicago division of the
road to handle the great Inflow of wheat
from the various branch lines in Kansas.
The difficulty is not so much from a car
famine as It >s due to the lack of motive
power to keep the lines cleared.
All the other roads In Kansas are un
able to handle the wheat offered. All the
elevators are full and farmers are dump-
ing wheat in bis piles on the ground near
the railroad stations.

LORD SALISBURY MAY
SUGGEST MODIFICATIONS
LONDON, Sept. 1.â The Forcipn Office
here apparently is not yet ready to puh
licly declare (Irrat . l.trltaln's . position in
the present Chinese situation, but all In
dications tend to confirm the belief that
Lord Salisbury favors the principle con
tained in the American-Russian proposals,
though possibly he may have some modifi
cation to supt*pst.
BERLIN, Sept 1.â Semi-officially it Is
reaffirmed 'that Germany nov;, as hereto
fore, adheres to the programme mapped
out in the circular of July 3 and then ap
proved by all the powers.
COMMENDS THE POLICY
OF THE ADMINISTRATION
DENVER, Colo., Sept. 1.â The Colorado
conference of the Methodist church, in
session at Sallda, to-day almost unani
mously passed a resolution commending
the Chinese policy of the administration
and also applauding "the course of all
those v.'ho in the Senate and House of
Representatives have supported the, ad
ministration in the foreign policy which
means an open-door for Christianity, as
well as for trade, and the protection of
American life and property all over the
world."
DIPLOMACY OF
RUSSIA IN CHINA
Text of the Circular to Powers
Proposing Withdrawal of
' Troops.
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 1â The Of
ficial Messenger to-day* publishes
the text of the circular addressed
to the Russian representatives
abroad, dated August .25. Tho offi
cial announcement, after mentioning the
unexpectedly rapid turn of military
events at the seat of war in Pechili, en
abling a "comparatively insignificant de
tachment" of the allied forces to attain
the original main object, the relief of the
legations and foreigners and the dispersal
of the rebels concentrated at the capital,
proceeds:
These favorable circumstances, however,
change in no way the political programme of
Russia, as previously marked out In the last
Government communique, and in order that
no misunderstandings or Incorrect interpreta
tions regarding the further intention of Rus
sia may arise the Emperor has directed the
acting Forelfm Minister to address to his rep
resentatives abroad the circular which follows:
The immediate objects which the imperial
Government had In view, at the outset of the
Chinese trouble were as follows:
"1. To protect the Russian legation at
Peking.
*"2. To assure the safety of Russian subjects
ajralnpt the criminal intentions of the. Chi-,
nese rebels. .
"3. To render help to the Chinese Govern
ment in ita strug-Rle with these troubles, m
the interests of a speedy establishment of thft
legal order, of- things In the empire."-
As a result all J the powers interested de
cided, with the same object In view, to send
troops to China. The imperial Government,
therefore, proposed the following; fundamental
principles to guide the powers in China:
"First â The maintenance of a common agree
ment among the power*.
"Secondâ The maintenance of "the ' former
state of organism in China.
-â¢â¢Third â The rembvarof everything that coulJ
lead to the partition of the Celestial Empire.
"Fourth â The- establishment with -the united
powers of a legal , central government at
Peking, able alone to preserve order and tran-
Qulllity in th<Â« country."
On these points agreements prevailed with
almost all the powers. While pursuing no
other objects the imperial Government will
continue to steadfastly adhere to ' its former
prosramme of action. When the course of
events, such as a rebel attack on our troopt>
at Niuchwang and a series of hostile acts by
the Chinese on our state frontiers, as for in
stance, the bombardment of Blagovetchensk.
Induced Russia to occupy Nluchwang and
march troors into the Alanchurian territories,
such timely measures, which were exclusively
prompted by the necessity of warding: off the
aggressive acts of the Chinese rebels, can in
no way testify to any Independent plans, which
are completely foreign to the policy of the im
perial Government. As soon as lasting order
shall have been established in Manchuria and
! indispensable measures , taken for the protec
tion of railway construction, which, .according
to formal agreement, China assure.d. Russia
will not fall to recall her troops from these
territories of the neighboring empire, provided
the action of other powers does not place any
obstacle in the way of such a* measure. It is
manifest that the interests of the other for
eign powers, and international companies at
the port . of J^luchwang. occupied by Russia
and open to International trade, as also on
the railways which have been restored by our
troops, remain inviolate and are fully assured.
By the capture of Peking, which, owing to the
changed circumstances, was affected more ex
pedltlously than expected, the first and prin
cipal-task which the Imperial Government Fet
Itself, the deliverance of the representatives of
the powers with all the foreign besieged, has
been accomplished.
The second task, nameljr, assisting In the
establishment of a legal central government,
which shall co-operate In the re-establ!shment
of . order and regular relations with the pow
ers, appears at present difficult, owing to the
departure from tha capital of tho Emperor and
Empress Regent/ and the Tsung 11 Tamen.
Under such | circumstances j the Imperial Gov
ernment does not consider there is sufficient
reason for the Ministers accredited to the Chi
nese Government to remain longer at Peking,
AMERICA'S ACTION A
GOOD POLITICAL MOVE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
:;:a:-,WELLIN-GTONHOTEL, WASHINGTON. Sept. 1.â As ex-
: -.i by official?, of the administration, there is no inconsistency between
Actirjsr Secretary of State Adee's reply to the Russian communication and
SerrftaTy Hay's note to the powers of July- 3. which have constituted the
ba-si? of the statement of the purposes in China on which the United States
has since acted. Secretary Hay'? statement of purposes was accepted by the
othfr powers and has formed the baÂ«is for all subsequent cction in China. The
first purpose, the relief of the Ministers besieged at Peking, has been accom
plish"!. This was a-ecompliF-hed by Joint action of the powers in sending the
international relief expedition to Peking. A high official of the State Depart
ment pointed out to me this afternoon that the powers were still co-operating to
afford &11 possible, protection everywhere in China to foreign life and property, to
R-uard ar.d protect ail lr-trit.ima.te foreign interests and to aid in preventing the
Fpread of fliporrierp. This co-operation has not. however, involved joint action
such as that required l>y the advance on Peking. It has been concurrent action.
There still remains the final purpose of co-operation to seek a solution which
may bring shout permanent safety and peace in China, preserve the Chinese ter
ritorial and 'administrative entity, protect all rights guaranteed by treaty and in
ternational lav to fri'-ndly powers, and safeguard for the world the principle of
equal and impartial trade with all parts of the Chinese empire.
It is with thH- last purpose that recent diplomatic negotiations have been con
cerned. It is the pinion of the United States, as stated in the note of Mr. Adee.
that this purpose as well as the continued protection of foreigners could be best
brought about by continuing joint co-operation, by joint occupation of Pelting
under a definite understanding between the powers until the Chinese Govern
ment shall have been re-established and shall be in a position to enter into new
treaty with adequate provision for operation and guarantee of future protection.
Although this Governm â¢ nt, as indicated by the language of Mr. Adee's note,
would have preferred to continue Joint action, it is not held that such action is
absolutely necessary to th<- attainment of .the purpose in view and co-opera
tion-can still continue concurrently if not jointly.
Being determined to avoid, if possible, serious complications with any of the
fortign powers and believing that the withdrawal of any one power from the Joint
co-operation would tend to make further efforts at joint action by other powers
ineffective and to introduce elements of discord, the administration has deter
mined not to remain in Peking it any other power withdraws. Kfforts will still
re made to preserve harmony and unity of purpose and action among the
powers, and it Js. contended tha.t t:ie determination to withdraw from Peking in
the event of; the withdrawal of any other power is in no way inconsistent with
the declaration of purposes in which the United States has acted since July 3.
Aithough.it c&nnot be said that political consideration had anything to do
with -.determining -the policy of the President, there is doubtless some political ad
vantage for Republicans In the turn alters have taken. The Democrats, in spite
of r> seated denials, have continued to harp on the charge that a. secret alliance
or undemanding existed between the United States and Great Britain. This last
move of the administration is clearly to the advantage of Russia, one of Eng
land's traditional enemies, and though England may be forced to fall in line rather
than be isolated with probably one or two other nations, there is no doubt that
the liriilfch Government would have preferred to have had the United States take
the opposite course. ' â¢ ; ./ Â¦
It c~'r : be said on the highest authority that all reports about friction in the
Ca-binet over this last move of the .administration and dissatisfaction on the part
of Secretary of State Hay are absolutely without foundation. Since Secretary
Hay has been away at his summer home at Sunnapee Lake he has been in fre
quent communication, with the President and State Department. He has made
suggestions which have been adopted and has approved the action taken In ad
vahco of Eugee^tloha from him. The text of the reply to the Russian note was
.Iranemitted to -him; and Acting Secretary Adee received last night hearty ap
provtavof it.. -.It cart be taid on the authority of Mr. Adee and members of the
Cabinet that there has been entire harmony In the Cabinet on all matters relat
ing to Chiira, : . , . -
lantry is contained in the following report
made to Washington:

CHINESE AND RUSSIANS IN- MANCHURIAâ RUSSIAN PRISONER UNDERGOING EXAMINATION BEFORE A MANCHU MANDARIN,
LONDON". Sept. 2, 4:25 a. m. â The continued absence of
news from Peking, the latest dispatches from the Chinese
capital being now ten days old, is arousing some anxiety,
but as the country between Peking and the coast is known to
be swarming with armed bands of Boxers it is not surprising
that couriers are not able to reach Tientsin. Shanghai reports
are to the effect that heavy French reinforcements are landing
at faku. Li Hung Chang, it is stated, has told a diplomatist
that Russia, considering the mission to Peking accomplished,
has agreed to request the powers to follow her example and
withdraw her Ministers and troops. The French Consul, how
ever, declares that such a request to France is entirely improb
able. Â¦ ; . - ' . .
A special dispatch from Berlin says it is rumored that Ger
iii.iny has rejected the Russianproposal for the withdrawal of
the troops and has made a counter proposal that Russia shall
retire, leaving the oâ¬icr powers to follow their own course.
According to a news agency's reports there is not much
doubt in London official circles as to the attitude of England.
It is pointed out that the withdrawal from Peking at the pres
ent moment, without a definite understanding with the Chinese
Government, would be simply courting a recurrence of recent
events. No understanding by Li Hung Chang would compen
sate for the diiliculties of further negotiations. Until the pow
' re receive a assurance from the Chinese. Government
England is not prepared to withdraw her troops.
It is announced that the embassy has forwarded to the For
eign Office a circular containing the proposal for the withdrawal
of the allies from Peking.

"Word reached here this evening that

Slaker is probably the greatest lino

Facial Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Srpt. 1.â The New York
Herald is enabled to present some figures
prepared and conclusions drawn by Re
publican managers as to the popular vote
of New York. McKinley'a plurality in the
Stnte in 1MÂ»6 was 2CS/XK). McKinley in
New York, Kings, Queens and Richmond
counties in lMtoj had approximately 00,000
plurality over Bryan. Roosevelt in lS'JS
in the entire State had less than lS.OiW plu
rality over Judge Van Wyck, while Van
AV'yck carried Greater New York by about
M>.<JOO.
In making their calculations Republican
managers have taken a certain number
of voters, ascertained what proportion of
them voted for McKinley in lisCHi and
changed to Van Wyck in 1898 and what
proportion of those last are noing to vote
for Bryan and McKinley this year. Tak
ing this basis a rough calculation has been
made and this gives the State to McKin
ley by some-thing more than 50,000. If
Richard Croker should make good his
pledge to give 80,000 plurality to Bryan in
(Jreater New York the State would be
quite as close on these Republican figures
as it was in 1898, when Roosevelt's ma
jority was, to be exact, 17,780.
Cornelius N. Bliss, treasurer of the Re
publican National Committee, believes
that New York State will give McKinley
and Roosevelt fomewherc in the neigh
borhood of 100,000 majority.
Representative James S. Sherman of
Utica was quoted in a Republican paper
on Friday morning as saying. that New
York was surely Republican. lie Â¦was
taken to task for making such a predic
tion by the Republican national head
quarters and denied that he ever said it.
He revised his interview and said that he
considered New York a doubtful State.
Richard Croker's friends and acquaint

ness of his assertions that New York is
going for Bryan.

The North China Daily News correspon
dent at Tientsin writes: The question of
the hour is loot. When the city was taken
on the 14th it must have been utterly un
expected by the inhabitants, for the
banks, bullion and silk shops had all their
stock exposed. It soon became a question
of help yourself to whatever you please,
otherwise the flames or natives will have
it. Large quantities of silver were seized
and* brought in both by officers and- men
of all nationalities; the civilians got wind
of It and knowing, bv the help of ser
vants, the right places, they began to do
great things. The Provost Marshal, with
great promptitude, interfered and raided
several houses where he knew bullion had
been stored.
In one case a particularly happy Neme
sis overtook the spoilers. Some American
wounded were sent to the hotel wher>
they and their loot were. These wounded
were refused admission: thereupon the
Provost Marshal and the American colonel
went down, forced the house and confis
cated a very large number of silver shoea
âa cartful. This led to several domiciliary
visits and one arrest; also to orders (1)
forbidding civilians to enter the city; (2)
to the sentries to search all parties com
ing from the city to the settlement. Very
large and valuable seizures were madt'.
in one .case a raiding syndicate of men
had a superb spoil of gold bars and end
less watches, etc. They passed every sen
try but the last, and v/ere then nonplused.
I hear an exacting search by domiciliary
visit is to be made.
The question is simple in some aspects
complex in others. It is absolutely cer
tain that civilians have no right to loot,
fyid when permission to do so is granted
to soldiers a common fund and fair di
vision should be made. The diversity of
nationalities in this case makes the di
vision extremely difficult and I think 111"
question will come to thisâ that the Brit
ish will divide amonc themselves that
taken by them and so on. One nationality
with great acumen made straight for
one of the treasuries and brought In 400 -
000 taels (4,000,000 taels?) by a mule train
and multiplicity of rickshaws: on dit that
next day much of It had disappeared from
the place in which it was stored, but thlj
on dit is itself a curious breeder of sus
picion. In the meantime looting has been
officially forbidden, though the natives
are now hard at it to the ineffable dis
gust of the soldiery. Clothes, furs, silks,
embroideries and curios were as dirt and
were trodden under foot as cuch. Tho
quantity that has come down is vast, but
it will find little market, as the colors
are impossible to European taste. The
fires in the city are still extensive, but
are small compared to its' area.
The Royal Welsh came across a stronff
fort away to the west an * captured a
battery of six Krupp 12-pour.ders, but with
breechblocks missinp. This is in all prob
ability the artillery headquarters at llan
chiashu, close to the grand canal. It had
been a constant marvel to some of ua
who knew the gun strength of the Chi
nese why these fine weapons were not
brought tip for our destruction. â From the
Japan Mail. â¢
~_^ DITOR of The Call â I inclose the above sugges-
I tive clipping from the Japan Mail.
1^ It is understood that the reason why foreign
nations have troops in China is to give protection
to their official representatives and to their citi
zens assailed by a lawless and fanatical mob. To
plunder China or to get revenge on her people is no legiti
mate part of their purpose, even though this mob be abetted
by the reckless present rulers of China.
No one. can defend the Â«cts of this mob or the behavior
of these rulers. Yetthese acts are the naturaloutcome of such
diplomatic successes as the seizure of Kiaochau and the
occupation of- Port Arthur. Most men and nations squirm
when they are dismembered alive.
The sole purpose of European nations must be the
restoration of order and safety in China. It is not easy to
see how such incidents as the sacking of Tientsin can
help to this end, nor- will any Chinese barbarity on rec
ord compare very much unfavorably with the recent con
duct of Russian Cossack troops about Tientsin, if we may
believe the stories of refugees.
When order is finally established it must be on the
basis of the independence of China. Her own people must
decide what kind of "an open door" suits them best. When
lawless acts are committed in China they must be atoned for
in lawful ways.*"
When the missionaries, Neis and Heule. were mur
dered in Shantung by some private enemies, the German
Government seized Kiaochau, "plantinor the German ban
ner in place of the dragon flag," to the simple stupefaction
of the Chinese authorities. "Our first and stroncest legal
title to Kiaochau," said the Germania in 1807. "is the
atonement for the murder of missionaries and the protec
tion of the missions which stand under the German pro
tectorate."
Later the Germnn Bishop, who encouraged this atone
ment, was led to recognize the evil of his "work in what
he calls "the fatal alliance of the German missions and
politics." It was a wise word of Luther, which cannot \
be quoted too often, that "the force of arms must be kept far
from matters of the gospel."
What Japan, England and America are doing now is a
necessity thrown upon them as civilized nations, and other
nations, so far as not swayed by revenge or hope of gain,
come into the same category. We could nothing: lessâ and
probably nothing more.
I note that English authorities refuse to countenance
"the Indianization of China." This is a naive confession
that the "Indianization" of foreign nations is either un
righteous or else unprofitable and England desires no more
Of it. _
There will be, in fact, no partition of China. No na
tion nor syndicate of nations desiring it is strong enough to
accomplish it, much less to rule China in peace after she is
once divided. The partition of Russia would, in the Ions:
run, be about as easy. DAVID STARR JORDAN.

WASHINGTON. Sept. 1.â So far as the
War Department has made any plans for
the return of the volunteer tropps from
the Philippines it is intended to com
mence the homeward movement about the
middle of November. No orders have yet
been issued on the subject, but it will take
practically all of the transport service
at the command of the department to ac
complish the return of the IO.OuO volun
teers between the date named and June
?.O of next year, when their term of ser
vice expires by operation of law. It is
the intention of the department to return
the organizations in the same relative or
der that they were shipped to the islands,
thus equalizing- as near as-"possible their
terms of foreign service. The foregoing
is practically the information that is be
ing returned to private inquiries of friends
and relatives or soldier* now in the Phil
ippines, with which t!ie department has
been flooded for some time past.

May Be Candidate for House
of Commons.
FREDERICTON. X. B.. Sept. 1.â The
resignation of Hon. Henry R. Eraraorson,
Premier of New Brunswick, and a reor
ganization of the Cabinet announced last
night were not due to a Government crisis
or'uny difference of opinion. The changes
grow out of the political relations between
the Canadian and provincial governments.
I3oth are strongly Liberal and work to
gether in all campaigns. The Ottawa
Government Is expected to dissolve the
House of Commons In a short time and
it Is understood Premier Emmerson re
signs In order to strengthen the Liberals
in the Federal contest,
i In this province they hold less than half
a dozen seats, and strong efforts will be
made to gain ground. It is thought Mr.
Emmerson may be a candidate for the
House of Commons.

United States Medical Officers Are
Closely Watching the Spread of
the Disease in Scotland.
GLASGOW, Scotland, Sept. 1.â The
Health Officer has issued a notification
to the effect that another plague suspect
was admitted to the hospital this morn
ing. There are now eighty-three persons
under observation, necessitating the op
crating of a second reception house. Some
of those first afflicted with the disease are
improving.
LONDON, Sept. 1.â The United States
medical inspectors are busy watching the
progress of the bubonic plague at Glas
gow. Dr. Hough will probably join ur.
Thomas at Glasgow on Monday. Dr.
Thomas' first object is to secure the name
of the vessel which brought the plague
to Scotland. This is no easy task, but
the matter is regarded as of great im
portance, and as soon as the vessel's iden
tity Is established Dr. Thomas will report
to Washington. The outbreak has had
a serious effect on the commerce of the
port.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 1.â On request of
the Canadian Government Surgeon Gen
eral Wyman cabled to Passed Assistant
Surgeon Thomas, the Marine Hospital
attache, directions to inspect the vessels
of all American and Dominion lines sail
ing from Glasgow for Canada during tne
period of danger or until the arrival of
a Canadian quarantine officer there. The
request was telegraphed here to-day by
Mr. Jarvis, Secretary of Marine at Ot
tawa, who admitted that the Canadian
Government would pay for the Inspection.
Dowie's Work in Europe.
LONDON, Sept. 1.â John Alexander
Dowie of Chicago, who came to England
to promote the Zlon movement, has been
kept busy this vreek. Although he has not
begun real work In London, Dowie is be
sieged with letters, telegrams and callers
urging him to Initiate the Zion movement
forthwith. Mr. Dowie, however, is going
to Scotland for a month's holiday before
beginning his campaign. His agents are
at work trying to secure a building for
the autumn operations.
MILWAUKEE, Sept. l.-The closing day
of the convention of the National Associa
tion of Local Fire Insurance Agents was
occupied with reports of the resolutions
and nominating committees. The most
important resolution from the former
committee was the restriction of broker
age. The convention adopted resolutions
asking companies to engage but one agent
in a territory containing a population of
100,000 or less, and providing for a general
campaign in favor of equitable legisla
tion affecting both agents and companies.
Conditions In each commonwealth were
discussed. AV. S. Fuss of West Virginia
said that his State was in need of legisla
tion, particularly a resident agent law.
W. 11. MadeVIHe said the New York Asso
ciation had increased 28 per cent in the
past year. He asked whether it paid to
have a secretary or solicitor. The loss
percentage In New York had been large.
A. W. Neill, president of the Ohio Asso
ciation, spoke in favor of the plan in
vogue in Ohio of having a salaried fire
marshal, who is a State or county officer,
to investigate fires Just as the Coroner In
vestigates sudden deaths, and whoso re
port la a part of the court records.
The report of the committee on nomi
nations was then adopted as follows:
Presidentâ George D. Marham, St. Louis.
Vice presidentsâ Thomas H. Geer, Cleve
land: W. H. Patlllo. Atlanta, Ga_: John

Resolutions Relating to Writing of
Insurance for Non-Resident Brok
ers Upon Property of Non-
Residents Adopted.
New Officers Are Elected
for the Ensuing
Year. -
CONVENTION OF
FIRE INSURANCE
AGENTS ENDED
"We recommend to agents, local boards
and all other associations of agents that
they decline to write for non-resident
brokers upon the property of residents:
that in writing for non-resident brokers
upon the property of non-re.Â«idents they
require that the broker offering business
be one recognized by the underwriting
association having jurisdiction over the
town in which he resides or does business;
that the rate and form of contract con
form In every respect with the rating as
sociation having jurisdiction over the
risk; that no rebate will be paid for busi
ness, and that the entire line is placed In.
accordance with such tariff, rates, rules
and regulations."
The convention reaffirmed its adherence
to the principles of sole agency repre
sentation at all points.
The place of holding the next convention
was not decided upon to-day, but was left
to the executive committee to decide. The
convention seems to favor Louisville for
next October. The convention adjourned
sine die.
The report of the committee on resolu
tions was read and adopted. The report
says :

Holmes, Chicago.
Chairman of executive committee-
Charles P. Whitney.

House at Frankfort by Repre
sentative Holland.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Sept. 1.âRepresent

course.

Typhoid Fever Is Spreading Rapidly

PARIS. Sept. 1.â The Chinese situation,
as viewed In Paris, has assumed a bright
er aspect. The practical unanimity of the
United States, Russia, France and Japan
in the desire to maintain the integrity of
the empire is regarded as disposing of any
question of partition. England's position
is undoubtedly a* strongly favorable to
the foregoing policy as that of any power
mentioned, but it is more pleasing to
France that bonds of accord should be
shown between the United States, France
and Russia and that these nations should
appear ti> be the controlling influence to
ward peace. America's proposition to ac
cept Li Huns Chang as go-between in the
negotiations is well received, although it
is still desired that he produce tangible
evidence that he is acting- for the central
power. In fact, France is ready to treat
with any plenipotentiary able to furnish
proper credentials. Russia's proposal to
withdraw the troops from Peking coin
cides with the feeling entertained in Paris
in favor of a conciliatory policy.
The acceptance of these two propositions
by all the powers is considered an im
portant step toward a satisfactory solu
tion and ono which Will avoid causing a
convulsion within China and will mini
mize the danger of conllict among the
powers. Germany and Italy form a doubt

views, but it is thought the weight of tho
pacific influence of the other nations will
bear down any bellicose intentions on
their part on the scales of European pol
icy.
Spread of Typhoid Fever.
The official medical bulletin this week
reveals a disquieting sanitary situation
in Paris. Statistics show that typhoid
fever prevails in an almost epidemic form.
There were recorded from the beginning
cf the year to August 13, 3148 cases, of
which 56S resulted fatally. This is a con
siderable increase over the records of
previous years. Paris is never free from
this disease, but until 1898 the number
of cases for the corresponding period did
not exceed 700. Moreover the hgures for
the last few weeks of the present year
show a perceotible increase over those of
the earlier periods. The prevalence and
spread of typhoid are due entirely to bad
water. One of the sources from which
Paris is furnished with water is known to
be infected with typhoid bacilli, though
the water from all the others is perfectly
pure. The authorities, however, declare
that they are compelled to utilize the con- (
taminated source because the others are
inadequate. The publication of these
alarming statistics may, however, spur
the responsible authorities Into seeking
fre*h sources. Meanwhile Parisians are
recommended to boil tho water they use
or to drink only mineral waters.
Over 600 German officers have vicited the
Paris Exposition since April last without
the slightest hindrance on the part of the
French authorities. There has been some
bitter comment regarding the difference
between the treatment of German officers
visiting France and that of French officers
desiring to revisit Alsace-Lorraine. TMe
only formality required of the German <ft
licers is that they register themselves ht
tne bureau of the military governor oi
Paris. One officer of very high rank and
live subordinate officers were among the
visitors. The remainder of the 600 were ma
jors, captains and lieutenants. /They be
gan to arrive f-oon after Emperor Wil
liam's note In the Reichsanzeiger com
mending them to visit the exposition.
Passports Refused.
Against the complaisance of the French
authorities the Parisian press calls atten
tion to the exasperating treatment or
French officers in the annexed provinces.
A case is cited where a French officer was
refused permission to enter Alsace-I.or
laine to bid faiowell to his dying mother.
A maiority of requests to enter meet with
refusals, it is s,aid, and even where they
are eventually granted the formalities are
interminable, otten rendering the permis
sion unacceptable. A former major in the
French army writes to the papers stating
that he recently applied for authorization
to enter Alsate-Ijorraine, pointing out
that he was 63 years of age and had re
tired from the army, and wished, before
he died, to see his aged sister again and
to make a pilgrimage to the graves of his
father and mother in the cemetery at Col
mar. The reply he received was an
abrupt refusal. The Matin, commenting
on this, says:
"This means that the enormous circular
regarding the abolition of passports is
nothing but a vulgar snare, issued with
the object of winning a welcome for Ger
man officers visiting the exposition, while
secret orders are given the Alsatian of
ficials to increase the severity of the reg
ulations regarding the applications oÂ£
French officers to visit the lost provinces."
It is admitted, however, that every fa
cility is affor/led Frenchmen for .ylslting
other parts of Germany. In fact, the
amiable attentions of German function
aries are described as embarrassing.
Overspeculation in Wool.
Two great French centers of the manu
facture . of woolen goodsâ Roubaix and
Tourcoingâ are in the throws of financial
disaster due to reckless speculation. The
wool gambling fever took hold of the
business houses last summer, when wool
rose steadily without apparent reason,
until in August the price reached the
high water mark of 6 francs 70 centimes
per kilogram. Speculators for a time lost
their heads, and there were daily pur
chases of a million or a million and a
half kilograms. The manufacturing busi
ness was dislocated owing to the extra
ordinary fluctuations in the price of ma
terial. Â«
Abundant warnings were given that the
; tlctitious values would inevitably lead to a
slump, but' they were unheeded until the
collapse occurred, and wool now stands
at 2 francs per kilogram below the Au
gust price. The amount of wool bought
blindly by Roubaix and Tourcoing firms
reached the fabulous total of 40,000,000 kilo
grams, which means a deficit of 80,000,000
francs. Thirteen axe already in the hands
of receivers, one house alone losing 8.000,
000 francs, and several others are -totter
ing 1 , but efforts are being made in Paris
to help them over the stile.
A banquet of gigantic proportions
will be given in Paris on September 22,
when President Loubet will entertain all
the Mayors of France, to celebrate the
exposition. Fifteen thousand guests will
sit down at tables In immense tentB erect
ed In the garden of the Tulllieries, over
looking the Rue de Rivoli. The banquet
will . cost 500,000 francs. The President,
his Ministers and the Exposition officials
will be present, and a gala exhibition will
be held In tho Salle des Fetes at the Ex
postlon In the afternoon, followed at
night by a fete with splendid illumination.

BERLIN, Sept. J.â The German press is
full of articles commenting on the latest
turn of the Chinese Question which is
generally construed as marking the be
ginning of serious lack of harmony be
tween the powers, whose Chinese interests
are colliding at too many points to en
able them to maintain a united front
lengthily. Russia's sudden change of at- |
titude came here as a complete surprise, j
since t/ie latest previous utterances of
Russia eeemed to der.oto a continuance '
of the closest German- Russo relation on
the subject of China, although it was
known here that the unmeasured Von

' everything points otherwise. The nation j

even including the Conservatives andjingo I

Demands a Narrower Policy,
The Kre-uz Zeitung constantly demands
that tlie Chinese policy be of narrower
limits, and the Deutsche Tages Zeitung
says conditions which allow the "sole
constitutionally responsible person,"
\iz., the Imperial Chancellor, "to absent
himAeif liuring the most critical times,"
and which "ignore the Foreign Oflice's
aims and declarations and also ignore tho
Kelchstag." are "hardly betrayable,"
Many papers of all shades talk similarly.
A Foreign Office official said to-day:
"Germany does not interpret the United
States' answer to Russia's note as moan
ing the withdrawal of the United States
front the entente of the powers. Naturally,
where the powers act together, it is im
possible for all to have the same ideas
at the same time. Any new proposition
must lead to any Interchange of opinions
to reach' an agreement, which will be the
result tins time."
Recent Turn of Affairs.
Regarding the Cologne Gazette's sensa

! of affairs in Chiri.i, which It is here
i claimed was Inspired by the Koreign Of

LONDON',- Sept. 1.â As soon as British
public opinion is able to shake off the
Russian, nightmare, which invariably ob
trudes upon the nations whenever any
Far Kastern question occupies interna
tional attention, it will, in all probability.
according to the views of the best in
iormed, heartily acknowledge the wisdom
of America's initiative toward a solution
: of a situation which threatens to reach an
impasse. At present the country finds a
touch of humor in the idea of an entente
between the great republic of the New
World and the powerful autocracy of the
j Old, and the Saturday Review sneeringly
j wonders which will ultimately give away
to the other. But. despite tho attempts of
the jingoes to becloud the real meaning
of the new understanding, it is believed
in authoritative quarters that the reasons
j actuating the United States will ultimate
ly recommend themselves to governmental
circles. Great Britain would doubtless
have preferred to assist In carrying out
i the original American proposals, but aÂ«
j the "Washington Government is prepared
to modify these In deference to Russian
views there is every indication that the
British Cabinet will accept whatever
| promise the quickest end to the contro-
Mutual Suspicion.
j The main trouble is that the whole of
Europe is in a mood of mutual suspicion,
j only too well calculated to promote Inter;
I national complications deprecated by the
j whole world. But diplomatic circles in
London are of the opinion that signs art-
I discernible that the tension will soon be
relaxed and lhat the jealousies will be 60
allayed that the powers will be enabled.
! in conjunction with the reformers and
Viceroys of the southern provinces, to de-
Vise a scheme for reconstituting the Gov
ernment of China In conformity \yiih the
will of the people and authorities of
I China. They emphasize the necessity of
I taking the advice of the great Yangtso
I viceroys, whose attitude during the pres
ent crisis has shown there are men in
Cliir.a who can govern when free from
the influence of the Manchu clique, and
who, it is thought, would gladly aid the
powers in the re-establishment of the
Government, perhaps by deposing the
Dowager Empress and reinstating the
Emperor. It is realized that many ugly
snags are likely to disturb the smoothness
of the current, but the opinion in the best
informed circles appears to be that latest
developments have materially helped to
clear the course. This opinion is shared
bv John W. Bookwalter of Ohio, who is
the author of recent books on Siberian and
Asiatic problems.
Takes the Right Stand.
"The Washington Government," said
Mr. Bookwalter, "Is taking exactly the
right stand, though certain circles in
England will exert every effort to dis
countenance the Russo-American rap
procliement. Fifty dollars of Chinese
trade is worth more to the United States
than fifty square miles of territory, and
;f the I'nited States continues friendly
with Russia the can obtain a share of
commerce which might easily be thrown
to Germany. I believe that when England
conies to understand that the Czar means
to protect the autonomy of Central China
Â«he will also see her way to heartily join
with Russia, for England must remember
that the Trans-Caspian Railroad puts a
Cos-sack army at the doors of India as
well a^ at Vladivostok."
In the midst of all the turmoil, not heed
ing the hysterical afliliations of armchair
guides of Great Britain, tke responsible
head of affairs, Lord Salisbury, rests
calm, confident and wary In the village of
Schlucht. a health resort in the Vospes,
| ten miles from the nearest railroad; sta
| tion, but at the end of a wire to Down-
I ing street. It is explained that one of
lxird Salisbury's reasons for going into
perfect solitude was to be able to work
during this trying period without inter
ruptions from Cabinet Ministers and oth
ers. Lord Salisbury's lonjr interview
with the French Minister of Colonies, M.
de Crnis. and the announcement that the
i Frr-noh Minister of Foreign Affairs. M.
I Delcasse; will shortly visit the British
Premier, are taken here to mean that tho
latier is improving the relations with
France, which, judging from thÂ« newspa
pers, certainly need improvement, for
dark rumors of possible war between
France and Great Britain are persistent.
Among Britons, However, It Is Gen
erally Conceded That the Atti
tude of America "Will Be
Finally Approved.

Men and women are subject to catarrh. Y/omen are even more subject to catarrh than men.
This is duB io many causes. The chief cause is the delicacy of her organism as compared to

g A Famous Cosmetic gjBOY POISONERS ENTER
A PLEA OF NOT GUILTY
Arraignment of the Youthful Crim
inals at Fresno and Setting of
the Date for Their Trials.
Fl>eclal Dist.atch to The Call.
FRESNO, Sept. l.-Fred Hlmes and his
cousin. Klmer Martin, the boy poisoners,
were arraigned before Judge Webb in the
Superior Court this morning on charges
of murder. They both pleaded not guilty
and Fred Hlmes' trial was set for Sep
tember 1". Frankie Ilimes, Fred's younger
brother, did not appear in court, but he
will be arraigned next week.
Fred Himea was brought up from the
jail by a Deputy Sheriff, and durlnp the
proceedings occupied a seat in the court
room, surrounded by a number of his
relatives. He did not betray the least
emotion, but was struck by the solemnity
of the court proceedings and watched
every move with interest. Judge M. K
Harris appeared as attorney for the boys
utid told thTn what to say in answer to
the questions of the court. When the
clerjt had finished reading the Information
charging Fred liimes with the murder of
his father by administering "Rough on
Hats" and the court had asked the de
fendant whether he was puilty or not
guilty he remained silent. "Just tell him
you are not guilty," whispered Judge
Harris, and the boy promptly answered
"Not guilty" in an audible tone. Elmer
Martin, his accomplice, entered the same
plea.
Judge Harris, on behalf of the boys,
then demanded separate trials for them
He also explained that witnesses would

In Consequence There Is a Pretty

Sseclal Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Sept. 1.â There was a
stormy time at the Republican County
Convention held in this city in the Su
perior Court room this afternoon. Thomas
13. Haven of Belvedere wa.s elected chair
man and B. W. Studley secretary. The
committee on credentials met in the Grand
Jury room and listem-d to several con
tests from different precincts as to the
seating of delegates named in the otficial
returns. The first contest was one in Pre
cinct 2 of this city.
G. Kohlhof filed a complaint in which
he stated that over thirty names of men
were voted at the primary who, In fact,
had not voted and some of whom were
out of town on the day in question. A list
of names was appended to the complaint.
Matthew Canavan, who had charge of the
booth, came before the committee and
admitted that he had been lax in receiv
lnK the votes. When questioned; however,
he said to the committee: "If a man had
come there and said his name was Mat
Canavan 1 would have voted him. "
Canavan was one of the delegates
elected and the. committee recommended
that his place on the County Committee
be declared vacant.
A hot time was at hand when the con
tests in Precincts 1 and 2 of Sausalito
were heard. AtJldavits, about eight in
number, were read showing that over 120
residents of San Francisco had voted at
the primaries. A list was furnished giv
ing their names and residences in that
city. It was charged that even the names
of racehorses had heen voted. Also that
no tests were Imposed, and that small
boys cast their ballots.
The committee linally recommended that
the contestants be seated. When the con
vention assembled the committee's rec
ommendations were accepted and J. T.
Harms, W. G. Morrow, J. F. Renner.
James Lowden, C. F. Becker, M. C.
Flores. G. T. Ryan. O. H. Harlon, J. J.
Jones and F. D. Gridsly were given seats.
E. C. Chapman, chairman of the com
mittee on platform, read the platform
adopted by the committee. It proclaimed
its faith in the Republican party and in
the leadership of McKinley and Roose
velt.
When nominations wen* In order J. W.
Atherton was unanimously nominated for
re-election to the Assembly. Johannes
Peters was nominated for Supervisor of
the Second District, Georpe K. Kins? for
the Third District and 11. A. Gouty for
the Fourth District. This concluded the
work before the convention and with three
rousing cheers for McKinley and Koose
velt the convention adjourned.

Thp foregoing if* the ticket named by the
Democrats of San Joaquin.
The convention dirt Â«omo queer things.
Kor the first time in nearly twenty years
Hen P. I-anpford, the "father of the Sen
ate," was not the party nominee for Sen
atorial honors from San Joaquin. The old
warhnrsr- stopped aside partly of his own
volition and partly through opposition In
his place Hllliard K. Welch, Â¦ younp man
from Ixxll, was named. The rank and tile
of the party never heard of or saw him
till he wns made chairman of the conven
tion to-day.
One of the most remarkable incidents In
local political history occurred when the
Stockton delegates met to nume a nomi
nee for Assemblyman from the city dis
trict. No one seemed to be out for the
nomination, and it was finally Riven by
acclamation to younp Joseph F. Peters,
the son of Major J. D. Peters, the local
capitalist. The nomination did not suit
the delegates on second thoucht and they
proceeded to reconvene, and after rescind
ing the nomination of Peters substituted
W. K. Johnson on the ticket. F. H. Kin
caid of Ripon was nominated for the As
sembly from the outside district.
\V. K. Jacobs was made chairman of the.
County Committee. One feature of ilie
convention was an attempt of the Populist
faction to throw off the lawyers' rule and
dictation. They were unable to succeed,
however, as a small r>and of attorneys
dominated every move made by the gath
ering.

SAN JOSE, Sept. 1.â Another link In
the chain of evidence tending to' prove
Jack Ortega guilty of assault on Grace

Â«xy examination ta-day.
The witness was Joe Gomes, an employe
of a brickyard. He ttsiiik-d that on Sun

girl. drive aJorig Iveyes street, just east of
Tenth street. He Identified the horse and
fcuggry as that of Ortega. He said the girl
wore a light dress. He would not identify
Ortega, as the man who was in the boggy.
Gorans further said that shortly before
takir.g the stand he was Invited dov/n to
a taloon by Milledge Ortega, a urother
of the prisoner, where he was asked to
testify that the horee he saw attached to
the bupgy was black, while Ortega's ani

Â«i a Â« a Sept. 1.â Mount Ba
'&k m \fl m ker is a semi-active
j\jff K&J3 volcano and belches
jSax. Jiw forth sulphurous
y smoke in volume al
most sufficient to overcome a person
standing near the crater
This news has just been brought down
bv a mountain climbing party composed
of J A- Lee. principal of the New What
com High School; F. F. Handachy. Dep
uty Treasurer of Whatcom County; F.
W. Eply and Robert Valie, members of
the State Normal School faculty of this
place, and diaries McPEerson. a well
known local druggist. After a perilous
climb they reached the crater of the
mountain on August 21.
Joe aiorovitz, a mountaineer, thor
oughly familiar with the vicinity, acted
as guide. But three times before has the
crater been reached, the last time in
1S91. The ascent was made from the east
side, the party leaving Baker Lake on
the morning of August 20. After a hard
trip through a Washington Jungle of un
derbrush and devil-club, up the steep
and almost 'precipitous hillside, they
reached the snow line that evening and
camped for the night. At 7 o'clock the
next morning they started to climb up on
the snow and ice, over a field almost lit
erally honeycombed with crevasses.
These, were broken in such" confusion as
to at times make the climbers think they
were cut off from progress. One of the
climbers lost his footing and would have
fallen to the bottom of a crevasso had
not his arms caught on the rope held
across by companions. At 3:C0 o'clock the
crater was reached, and it is described
by Mr. Lee as follows:
"The crater is an orifice In the snow,
about thirty feet in diameter/ from which
rise sulphurous vapor and smoke. For
merly the basin must have extended for
acres between the smaller and larger
peaks, but this Is now filled with
snow and ice and only a small hole re
mains. At times the odor of sulphur al
most overpowers one, and sulphur crusta
tions have formed all over the bordering
snow. The vapor was so thick as to
cloud the sun and at times the smoke
would rise as frcm a staok for fully 1000
feet before dissolving. Some distanco be
low the crater cur guide, Morovltz, in
prospecting for a passage over one
crevasse, found fumes rising from It and
was for a moment nearly overcome. It
must have followed through an under
ground channel from the crater.- The en
tire mountain - in the vicinity Is oÂ£ vol
canic formation.
"After spending a while at the crater
all the party,but Handschy and McPher
son, who remained to get views, continued
the ascent of the main peake or dome. 1C00
feet higher. The crater lies almost direct
ly south from Jt, and the climb la com
paratively easy. At the top of the dome
there is a tract of 100 acres almost perfect
ly level. On this day tho c'ouds obscured
a view of the lower country, but the sur
rounding mountains could be seen, their
peaks piercing the sea-like strata of
clouds. Mount Rainier, more than 100
miles away, stood out In plain view. The
temperature was about twenty-five de
grees above zero.
"We did not remain lonjr, owlns to the
lateness of the hour. Our trip back to the
timber line. 6000 feet below, was made in
an hour and three-quarters. "We would
sometimes sit down on the snow, which
would bank into a kind of sled under us.
and elide for a Quarter of a mile. We
camped that night at the timber line
again, where there was no snow. The
surroundings were park-like and beauti
ful. The next day we reached Baker
Lake, which Is really at the base of the
mountain."
Mount Baker lies forty miles east "of
this city and ten miles south of the Brit
ish Columbia boundary line. It is nearly
11,000 feet high and is one of the mos:
rushed peaks on the continent, being con
sidered perhaps the hardest to ascend.
This was the first ascent maile from tho
east side and la the moat successful ever
accomplished. It establishes beyond all
question the fact that Mount Baker la a
semi-active volcano. In 1SD5. a party of
Mazamaa from Portland made an unsuc
cessful attempt to climb the mountain
from the north.

DR. TALKS OF FOOD.
Pres. of Board of Healttu
"What shall I eat?" is the daily in-
quiry the physician is met with. I do
not hesitate to say that, in my judgment.
a large percentage of disease is caused
by poorly selected and improperly pre-
pared food. My personal experience
with the fully cooked food, known as
Grape- Nms, enables me to^speak freely
of its merits.
"From overwork, ~T. suffered several
years with malnutrition, palpitation of
the heart and loss of sleep. Last sum-
mer I was led to experiment personally
with the new food, which I used in con-
junction with Â£ood rich cow's milk. In
a short time after I commenced its use
the disagreeable symptoms disappeared,
my heart's action became steady and
normal, the functions of the stomach
were properly carried out and I atrain
slept .as soundly and as well as in my
vouth
"I look upon Grape-Nuts as a perfect
food and no one can trainsav but that
it has a mo^t prominent place in a ra-
tional, scientific system of feeding. Any
one who uses this food will soon be con-
vinced of the soundness of the principle
upon which it is manufactured and mav
thereby know the facts as to its true
worth." W. B. Conway. M. D., Pres.

BY way of encouraging such wavering mug
wumps as are inclined to vote against Me Kin
lev, but hesitate to vote for Bryan because of
the Tillmans. Altgeid> and Crokers who arc asso
ciated with him. the Springfield Republican has care
fully constructed an elaborate argument to prove that
if elected to the Presidency Bryan would be able to
find among his supporters material for a very good
Cabinet. It concedes that the question of what man
ner of men Bryan would call to the head of aiTair3
is an important one in the campaign, but argues that
it can be answered in a way satisfactory to the intelli
gence of the country.
The Republican says such men as Altgeld, Sulzer,
Tillman and Simpson "would not be likely to be found
in the list of Cabinet appointments." and adds: "It is
only fair to say this because several reasons exist why
those men and men of their peculiar notoriety would
not be considered for Cabinet positions. Mr. Alt
geM would be out of it because he is a nervous end
physical wreck and with him disposed of one
lurid nightmare disappears. Mr. Bryan, more
over, is unquestionably a shrewd man in politics;
even his bitterest enemies now concede he has some
brains, and Mr. Bryan is not the one to take into
his Cabinet men who have acquired notoriety to a
conspicuous degree fcr eccentricity, impulsiveness or
rattie-headedncss."
Here we have a string of brave assertions, not one
of which can IÂ»c accepted as reliable, even though
stated by the Republican. There is nothing in Bryan's
career to show that he would exclude rattle-headed
fellows from his Cabinet. His affiliations, political
and otherwise, have been mainly with men of that
character. He is in fret himself a man of that type.
Moreover, if he be elected he will owe his success
mainly to that sort of men and it is to be presumed
he would have the fairness to be true to them after
election. Kvery reasonable assumption in the prob
lem is therefore directly the opposite of those the
Republican has put forward and they are not to be set
aside by the mere dictum of a newspaper that does not
speak even with the authority of a Bryan organ.
By way of supporting its claims the Republican
gives a list of statesmen whom Bryan would find
available for Cabinet timber. It is a curious combina
tion. As probabilities we have these: For Secretary
of State â Senators Bacon of Georgia, Daniel of Vir
ginia, McCreary of Kentucky and David B. Hill of
New York; Treasuryâ John P. Jones of Nevada,
Coler of New York, Towne of Minnesota. Teller of
Colorado and O. H. P. Belmont of Xew York: War
âHarris of Kansas, George Fred Williams of Massa-
BRYANtTE CABINET TIMBER.
Some men in that list are pold Democrats, some
are known as erratic statesmen of the rankest kind.
but most of them .are unknown. It is the best list,
however, that even a mugwump can pet together after"
scraping the vhole country over. If by that showing
of available timber for a Bryanite Cabinet, any citizen
of Massachusetts can he induced to vote for Bryan,
then the average intelligence of the Bay State must
have fallen heavily since the last election. As a matter
of fact Bryan is in the hands of Altgelds and the
silver ring now. and their hands will control him after
election. He would have no conservative Cabinet.
His administration would be as disastrous as his cam
paign is threatening.

THE MANSflRD ROOF JOB.
SIOULD any citizen of San Francisco desire
further prooi than lies on the surface of the
job involved in the proposal to erect a mansard
roof upon the City Hal!, it can be found in the fac?s
t^ated in connection with the subject in another
:ran. Competent architects declare that on struc
tur;il ground* the present root is better than the pro
j'o.-e.i ma:i<ard, because it imposes less strain
i'l" 1 !! the walls. It is also shown that the reported
excessive leakage of the present roof is without foun
dation, - since the Board of Works has enterei
.ir.to a contract with a responsible contractor to have
the roof maintained water-tight and in pood repair
for the sura of $6o a month.
Since there is so little cost to keep the present roof
in pood order, why should the city authorities put the
taxpayers to the expense of tearing it out and puttin ;
i:t place of it a mansard which will certainly
cost more than $1,000,000. and by some experts has
been climated to cost $1,500,000?
It requires no very great powers of penetration to
perceive that in the Brannhart proposition there is a
job of enormous proportions. To justify it not a
single valid reason can be Riven. It has been asserted
that the roof is cracked and leaks, but these assertions
are not true. They ere disproved by the very con
tract the Board of Works has made to keep the
roof in sound condition. For so large a roof as that
&r. expenditure of $60 a month is a trifle, and that a
contractor is Hilling to undertake the work at that
price is an evidence of the substantial nature of the
roof construction. It has been asserted there is need
in the building for the additional room the mansard
roof would give, but it i> known that the Police De
rartmer.t. the Police Courts and the City Prison are
to be removed, and thai then there will be ample space
available for the ofr.cos that remain.
There will be big money in the job if the people per
mit it to be carried cut, but the money will be for
those who manipulate the job. It is to be taken out
of the pockets of the taxpayers end the revenues of
the municipality at a time when there are serious
r.eeds for money in almost ever)' department of
administration. We have recently seen the streets
left in darkness for menths and they are still badly
swept and insufficiently sprinkled. There is need for
tetter school buildings and for better sewers, there is
rued for a Public Library building. In fact, there are
many things needed in the city, but there is one thins?
not neededâ and that is a mansard roof on the City
I la!!.
The various improvement clubs of the city should
sive attention to this job at once, for it is safe to say
if the present roof b? taken off the City Hall it will
open that building to a new series of jobs that will
equal any that have been so costly to the taxpayers in
the past. ,
After my notice of "The Only Way" was
published I found this mention of th*
play in the Nineteenth Century for Au
gust by Frederic Wedmore: " "The Tala
of T-wo Cities 1 is a masterpiece into the
adaptation of which â¢ â¢ â¢ there was suf
fered to intrudeâ for what reason one can,
but vaguely guessâ the new and quite
conventional character of MimIâ a long.
elaborate, idle vulgarization of. Dickens"
own exquisitely touched episode. In which
i stranger girlâ no lover of Sydney Car
ton, but just a human thing in direneedâ
comes and finds human help in Carton's
presence at the moment when the tumbril
hastens to the guillotine. Theatrical and
not literary; melo-dramatlc and not poetic;
impert'.nent. in the true sense, where in
dealing with the conception of a genius
all should have been appropriate as well
as reverentialâ impertinent. I consider.
was that' intrusion." Now, that merely
goes to show how tastes differ. A very
competent judge who saw Miss Anglin in
this part assured me it was the mo^t
beautiful thing in the whole play. That
is quite credible to me. and I think It must

PERSONAL MENTION.
It is now well known that Mr. Pinero
was not a success as an actor, yet his
?-xporiences as such must have been richly
beneficial to him us playwright. Except
as their happenings may be woven into
the incidents of his early farces, we have
no record of the years that followed the
Kdin^oro engagement until we come to
1R05, when he tells us of walks with
Archer by shore and cliff and of his salu
tary, well preserved resolve never to read
unfavorable criticism of his plays. Con
stant practice has so sharpened his In
stinct for Detecting the Presence of Ad-
How true, how wise a saying! How full
of instruction for those whose virtue Is
due only to the accidental absence of
temptation!
It was during these "busy, cheerful,
healthful times" in Edinboro, when he
was "happier than any king in history,
richer than any South African billionaire
of to-day"â it was during these times that
Mr. Pinero met the lady who afterward
became his wifeâ a "pretty little lady, an
actress, with an unusual but soft-sound
ing Christian nÂ«>me." It was during these
days also that he met that other lady,
whose name he dof s not give but whose
name we should like to know, that we,
too, might honor her memory as does he â
"a mere girl, indeed, now dead and gone;
a sweet, simple creature, who was nothing
but a- very poorly paid drudge of a "lead
ing lady,' but whose history, one of cheer
fulness, patience and virtue presprved
against temptation, misfortune and the
stress of constant struggle, would form a
useful lesson to those inclined to speak
slightingly of "nor class."
Mr. Pinero' s fortune at his theatrical
birth consisted of a six weeks' engage
ment to play "general utility" at the The
ater Royal, Edinboro, for 55 a wet k. Yet
these weeks, he tells us, were among the
happiest of his life. Youth, health, en
thusiasm (and $5 a week) carried him
safely through real dangers and real
hardships: his observation, too, was at
work and he was beginning to make those
studies of Scotch character which we see
so humorously portrayed in many of his
plays. Here is an incident which I think
he lias never used on the stage, but which
is full of comic possibilities: "I shared
this (temperance) hotel with one other
guest, an old gentleman, whose general
mellowness made me wonder at his select
ing the shelter of such ungenial wails.
One day. however, in the course of a
guarded talk with me he let in a faint
light upon my doubts by informing me
tiiat if you wont to bed early in a tem
perance hotel and then rang the bell vio
lently and complained of sickness the
landlord or landlady was obliged, under
heavy penalty, to produce a bottle of
whisky and to leave it on a chair by your
bedside. Such, he assured me, is the law
of Scotland."
His dreadful resolution of "going upon
the stage" had caused his weeping mother
great anxiety-cn anxiety which had been
only partially relieved by his equipping
himself with a theatrical oak trunk of the
largest dimensions. This trunk had once
be^n a plate chtst in a noble family; com
bining thus in itself respectability, weight
and age, it seemed to Mrs. Pinero to
lend Arthur all the dignity possible in his
(to her) undignified profession of actor.
This trunk furnished good cause for
curses, both loud and deep, from every
unlucky porter condemned to carry it, and
was soon disposed of by the future dra
matist at a price justly low on account of
the expense to the purchaser of cart hire
for its removal.
Mr. Pinero was born, he tells us. Just
outside the Waverley railway station.
Edinboro, on a melancholy, mysterious,
humid night in the month of June, one
thousand eight hundred and seventy-four.
Tho place Impressed one as odd and the
time as impossible, since we remember
that "The Second Mrs. Tanqueray" â the
most powerful English prohlem play of
the centuryâ was written in 1S92, when, ac
cordlrg; to the above 'statement, the author
must have been only IS years of age. To
relieve our perplexity Mr. Tinero hastens
to assure us that when he says "born" he
means "born into the theatrical world,"
for it was at the time and place men
tioned, at the age of ly. that he made his
appearance in that firmament of which
he has since become the brightest star.
acquire some knowledge of the man
we must supplement this with the few
biographical details privon us by Mr. Pinero
himself in his open "Letter to William
Archer" (January 6. ISOrt).
THE most interesting figure in Mr.
Tarpey's study of the English dra
matists of to-day (the Critic for
August; Is Mr. A. W. Pinoro. Mr.
Tarpey's article deals exclusively
with Mr. Pinero"s literary work. To
MANY plain signs are abroad that the public schools of San Francisco are lapsing
into a deplorable condition.
The introduction of the worst evils of patronage into the School Board has
caused widespread alarm among the teachers. Sinister devices are used for subjecting
the department to the coarsest favoritism. Tyros in teaching, are elevated over expert
and experienced teachers, and by injurious consolidation of classes and abolition of
schools, room is made for the pets of the board. The interests of the schools are not con
sidered. The wishes of parents are insultingly ignored) The requests of organizations of
! citizens are unheeded, ami teachers go to their daily tasks with that uncertainty of tenure
which is incompatible with good work.
It is peculiarly necessary to the most efficient teaching that the teacher shall be free
| from the care and anxiety which arise in this state of uncertainty. The board has fos
tered a system of envy, revenge and self-seeking, of tattling and backbiting, which is highly
demoralizing. Indeed, if this strange board had taken a contract to discredit the public
school system, to make it deserve all that its enemies say against it and to finally break
it down, its course would be explicable. We have had boards before, and "tough old
boards." too. bill all of their corruption, ignorance and venality put together has not in
jured the schools to the extent to which they are being damaged now.
The law settles the tenure of a teacher, m and the courts have many times sustained it.
to the great advantage of the department. Training the young is a task of great delicacy
and difficulty. It is of vast importance. It concerns the future of the individual and
of the country. The law. therefore, has gone far in the direction of giving a vested right
to teachers in their employment, of which they cannot be deprived without cause. This
is to secure the menial and nervous eqtiipoisc needful to the best work in the schoolroom.
The board has nullified all this by its cunningly devised schemes of oppression, by which
the very best teachers are easily victims of the very worst and most unscrupulous. If the
board wore acting under the advice and guidance of the most inveterate enemy of the
public school system, it could not do more injury to that system than it is doing.
In the process of consolidation to make away with teachers of experience and event
ually make way for the raw favorites of the members of the board, another injury has
been done that strikes the pupils directly. The curriculum has been jangled into the
greatest confusion. The course of study needs reducing and simplifying â not increase
and complexity. This process of overloading is the common vice of the whole system,
especially in cities, and is rapidly approaching a climax here. Instead of reform in that
respect the present board is making matters worse. Complexity goes on unchecked.;
Studies multiply. Classes increase in size, rendering impossible that degree of personal
attention required by pupils. The whole system is made hectic and unwholesome.
The board has in effect established in the schools a kindergarten for the insane asy
lums. Under its system there is no symmetrical training of the mind and equal develop- j
merit of all its faculties. â¢
The system is a constant strain upon the memory, and develops that faculty abnor- !
mally. while reasoning, imagination, ideality and the other mental qualities, which must i
be developed in harmony and equality to make the well-equipped individual, are left to
haphazard <*Â¦ go without training at all. Now. memory is that faculty of the mind which
yields first to "overstrain, to age and to disease, and it becomes the torch which sets i
the whole brain on fire. Aphasia is the forerunner of mania. Memory, abnormally bur- j
dened, developed at the expense of the other functions of the brain, like a crazed giant i
destroys the faculties that have been weakened to make it strong.
The marvelous increase of insanity in the country is attributed by many professional ;
alienists to this lop-brained training in ,the public schools, which prevents symmetrical de
velopment of the mind, leaves the reasoning faculties dwarfed and ruins minds that un- i
der a better system would be sound and sane.
If mental decay do not* follow and overtake the victims pf this svstem they are apt;
to be found in the grasp of some of the nervous diseases, grouped under neurasthenia, !
an army of enemies to human welfare, which render their victims unfit for the duties of'
life. But what does this School Roard care for all this in comparison with the chance '
to play its favorites and squeeze advantage out of patronage?
Worthy teachers may cringe under the lifted lash of its design and displeasure and
not move the sympathy of the combination of voluptuaries and politicians who compose
it. What does this club-roosting board care for the little children who arc subjected to
unjust burdens, borne for no useful end, and who writhe and mutter in their unrefresm'ng
sleep, the victims of unnatural and unwholesome methods of training!
What does it care for the considerable percentage of the youth of the city which it is
condemning to the madhouse, to howl and gibber in the convulsions of insanity!
What does it care for the taxpayers robbed of their substance, and the parent*
robbed of their young, so long as it can make places for its favorites and drive the pat
ronage juggernaut over the victims of its .greed and displeasure!

OUR RELATIONS
WITH MEXICO
Will Be Strengthened and Cemented.
The excursion to Mexico which Is sched
uled by the Southern Pacific for Wednes
day, November 14, is attracting wide
spread interest throughout the Pacific
Coast. Although there should be and
really is a strong natural tie between
California and the quaint old republic,
for all practical purposes the two coun
tries have been for years undiscovered
to each other. One great reason Is that
commercial relations have not been en
couraged and another is that California
is so vast in her own resources, both for
pleasure and profit, that her people have
found plenty to occupy their attention at
home.
Now there seems to be an awakening all
round and relations in future will be
found much closer. This excursion is a
beginning. It is so very cheap that a
great many will go purely for pleasure,
and for the same reason representatives
of extensive commercial interests will go
for purposes of commercial exploita
tion; and the result is bound to be im
mensely beneficial to both countries. The
round trip rate from San Francisco will
be $S0 and the train will be personally
conducted throughout.* Arrangements for
side trips and sightseeing are very com
plete.
AVillinm H. Menton, the Southern Pa
cific's agent, who is to manage the excur
sion, is familiar with Mexico, speaks Its
language and will be glad to answer all
inquiries. He can be found at the city
ticket office, 613 Market street, between
12 and 1 midday.

"DOUGHNUT SAL" SENT
TO JAIL FOR VAGRANCY
The Woman Is Estimated to Be Worth
About Thirty Thousand
Dollars.
Sarah Folsom, a woman about 50 years
of age, appeared before Judge Fritz yes
terday morning on a charge of vagTancy.
She was arrested Friday night by Police
men Dinan and Brodt. She is known on
the Barbary Coast as "Doughnut Sal,"
from the fact that she lives as a rule on
doughnuts and coffee.
The otlloers testified that the woman
lived on Stark lane, off Stockton street,
between Pacific and Broadway, and that
the place was fiithy in the extreme. She
is estimated to be worth about $30,000. Hei
fortune consists of money deposited In the
German Savings Bank and in property in
the country, but she was so penurious
that she haunted the saloons on the Bar
bary Coast and begged money from the
frequenters. The Judge sent her to the
County Jail for ten days.

Oeorge H. Soott. speaking about the
placers in tho Vaqui River country. Mex
ico, after spending two months along tlir>
banks of the Aros River, a tributary ot
the Yaqui, says a California mining com
pany has shipped in considerable machin
ery and has also planned to dam the mo?t
promising tributaries of the Aros and
turn them from thrlr courses. Then It is
proposed to work the best of the streams.
Several dams have already been con
structed, and the most improved methods
of placer mining have been Introduced
there. Individual miners have been clear
ing up from $3 to $10 per day with primi
tive methods. A big syndicate has been
formed to work the beds of former
streams. The gravel Is rich in coarse
gold. Water will have to he conducted

acres five miles from the present bed of
the Aros and forty miles from the. mouth
of that river.

The case of Charles Bhiveley against the

The Placerville Nugget reports that the
THE life limit of James Burns, robber
and ox-convict, has been judicially
determined. Judge William P. Law
lor pronounced judgment against
him yesterday and sentenced him to serve
"half his life" in Folsom Prison. Thirty
eight years of life was given the convict
under the ruling of the court, nineteen of
which he must pass in penal servitude.
If death overtakes him before the expira
tion of these nineteen years Burns will
have been cheated of his liberty for just
one-haJf the period that lapses from date
to tho time of his death. If his thread of
life spans beyond the given thirty-eight
years he will have cheated the people and
the State.
That the records of the courts of
tho United States, or, in fact, the world,
can show an alalogous case is doubtiul.
The peculiarly tangled condition of the
Penal Code, aided and abetted by a care
less jury, conspired to produce this
strange result. That Burns was not given
his liberty, even though the jury found
him guilty of a crime which they named
themselves, was due solely to Judge Law
lor's ingenuity in finding law to nt the
case. Whether the Supreme Court will
hold the reasoning of the lower court
sound or faulty is problematical.
The history of the case and the proceed
ings whicli culminated in Burns' consign
ment to Folsom Prison "for half his nat
ural life" are of peculiar interest. James.
Burns, alias James Welch, was arrested
in April of this year and charged with
robbery. Fred Hausman was the com
plaining witness. He testified that Burns,
assisted by an unknown "pal," "held him
up" on the corner of Kearny and Com
mercial streets and robbed him. Burns
was placed on trial before Judge Lawlor
for the offense and was convicted of "an
attempt to commit robbery." Three prior
convictions were proved against the pris
oner, the first offense causing his deten
tion in the County Jail for one year and
lor tho second he served a term of two
years in Folsom. His record as a criminal,
had he been convicted of robbery, left
the court with no alternative other than
to sentence him to life imprisonment On
his conviction of "an attempt to commit
robbery" under the statute the court had
J.o alternative but to sentence him to
prison for half his life, which the court
has done.
When Burns was called for sentence by
Judge Lawlor yesterday A. Ruef, who
represented the prisoner, called upon the
court to dismiss the prisoner.
"The accused," said Mr. Ruef, "has been
found guilty by a jury in this court of an
offense which does not appear in the
Penal Code. No such crime as 'an at
tempt to commit robbery' is known to
the statutes of this State. 'An assault
with intent to commit robbery' is desig
nated as the crime committed when an
assault with intent to commit robbery is
made, and it was this crime, if any, which
this defendant committed. As no such
crime as 'an attempt to commit robbery'
if. rocopxized by the statutes I ask that
the court discharge the prisoner."
Judge Lawlor rcl'used to consider the
motion.
"Though It 1b trap," said Jucl^e T>awlor,
"that the offense of which this defendant
s-tands convicted is not specified among
the crimes i.amed in tho code, in my
opinion it is covered by the general laws
relating to specified crimes, and this de
fendant may be punished under those pro
visions. Even though the prisoner had
not been gTillty of prior offenses and had
been convicted of robbery the court un
der the law Is empowered, to pass a llfo
sentence for such crime. The section thu3
empowering the court reads;
Whenever any person is declared punishable
for a crime by Imprisonment In the State
prison for a tfrrn not less than any Â»pecifled
number of years and no limit to the duration
of such imprisonment is declared, the court
authorized to pronounre Judgment upon sued
conviction may, in Its discretion, sentence such
offender to imprisonment during his natural
life or for any number of years not less than
that prescribed.
"As the punishment for robhory is fixed
at not les-.s than one year the power ol
the court to fix a life sentence cannot be
disputed. In this case, however, the de
fendant has been guilty of prior offenses,
and prior convictions of petty larceny
stand against his name. Had he been
convicted of robbery the court would have
been bound to consider the prior convic
tions, and in obedience to the mandate of
the law would have passed a life sen
tence upon tho defendant. He has been
found guilty of 'an attempt to commit
robbery,' however, and under the law the
judgment of this court must subject the
defendant to punishment by confinement
in the State prison for not more than halt
the period of the sentence which would
have been imposed for the completed
crime of robbery. This means that the de
fendant must be sentenced to one-half
his natural life In prison. The provision
In the code covering- this point reads:
Every person who attempts to commit any
crime, but fails, or is prevented or intercepted
in the perpetration thereof, is punishable
where no provision Is made by law for the
punishment of such attempts as follows: If
the offense so attempted is punishable by im
prisonment in the State prison for five years
or more, or by imprisonment In the County
Jail, the person jrullty of stich attempt la
punishable by imprisonment in the State prison
or in a County Jail, as the case may be, for
a term not exceeding one-half the longest term
of imprisonment prescribed upon a conviction
of the offense so attempted.
"The difficulty which confronts this
court Is to fix the term of Imprisonment.
The defendant is admittedly 25 years of
apre. and is admittedly sound and well
physically. The American experience mor
tality, upon the calculations of which life
insurance corporations conduct their busi
ness, says that a man 25 years of age,
physically sound, has even chances of liv
ing 38 years, or of reaching 1 his sixty-third
year. This defendant, under these calcu
lations, which are accepted as the best,
has thirty-eight years of life before him.
It is hence the judgment of this court that
he shall be confined in the State prison at
Folsom for the period of nineteen years."
Mr. Ruef forthwith recorded several ex
ceptions to the ruling of the court.
"The question which your Honor is at
tempting to decide is incapable of de
cision," said Ruef. "No human mind can
fix the limit of a man's life. Suppose it
should be decided one-half of Burns' life
is ten years and he was committed for five
years. At the end of five years he died.
Thus would he he cheated out of two and
a half years of liberty, the court being
vested with power to alone sentence him
under your theory to one-half the term
which would be imposed for the completed
crime."
Ruef continued this line of calculation
to the end. but Judge Lawlor refused to
consider his motion to dismiss. Burns
was then ordered to stand and Judgment
was passed upon him. Mr. Ruef made ap
plication for a ton days' stay of execution,
which Judge Lawlor granted.
A writ of habeas corpus will be sworn
out before the Supreme Court and the
soundness of Judge Lawlor's reasoning
finally determined.
If this court finds Judge Lawlor's rea
soning to be unsound the prisoner must be
freed, for he has been once In Jeopardy.
Peculiar Circumstances Cause a Tangle Which
Results in Passing of Unprecedented
Sentence on a Criminal.

Pilorr.a Schramm. assisted by her small
sister Karla, pave a farewell piano recital
yesterday afternoon at Sherman-Clay
Ilali before a Jarge and appreciative audi
ence. The programme was a familiar one,
containing numbers in which the clever
little piahist has been heard many times.
The Mozart "Kantasie in L> minor" and
the Bach "Gavotte" were perhaps the
happiest renderings, and the little com
poser's own works, Op. 29 and 30 (!) were
listened to with much pleasure. The
Sc'nubert R flat variations were not so
well Riven, standing much in need of
careful revision, and illustrating very ef
fectfvely the necessity that exists for
jjorid teaching at this stage of the career
of the little genius. The same may be
Sr-.id of the Beethoven "Adaelo" and tiie
Schubert-Liszt "Hark! Hark! The

Water Front Notes.
Iowa Short of Coal.
The battleship Iowa will not have an
ounce of coal in her bunkers this morn
ing, and the donkey boilers will have to
shut down in consequence. Such a state
of affairs has never been heard of before
in the history of the t.'nitcd States navv.
That a warship shouid be worse than "a
hulk because she has no power to drive
her machinery is preposterous. Three
weeks ago the Iowa began to run short of
coal and the work of supplying the de
ficiency was let to the barge Comanche.
The latter broke down while trying to get
here and ever since the battleship has
bc<,n on short allowance. Last night
every ounce of coat aboard was burned
up and to-day the cooks will have to bor
row coal to cook the regular meals. The
Comanche after a three weeks' rest at
Mare Island will get to the Iowa some
time to-day and the coal famine will be
over.
Captain Tilton, the Pacific Mail Com
pany's superintendent at Panama, will
not forget the Mail steamer Acapuico in
a hurry. The Aeaoulco arrived from Paji
ama and way ports last Friday, and the
crew says that Captain Tilton would have
tret his death had it not been for Cap
tain Russell and the steam launch of the
Acapuico. Captain Tilton wanted to make
a trip to Tobago Island, and invited Pur
ser .Morton aiid Dr. Dukes of the Aca
puico to go along. Coming back from the
island the boat capsized and all hands
clung- to the keel for nineteen hours.
Finally the boat drifted ashore on a bar
ren islet ar.d from there they were res
cued by the Aeapulco's launch, in com
majid tjf Captain Russell. Captain Tilton
is still alive and hearty, while Purser
Morton and Dr. Dukes assert the whole
affair was only a holiday excursion.

Lieutenant Colonel Corliss starts for the

his command was under orders to hurry
through to China. He came along to San

NEWS FROM THE
OCEAN AND THE
WATER FRONT
Believing Kapp's statements to be true
Koehncke says he advanced $2000, Karl
W. Mueller 51000 and Alfred Fuhrman, as
agent for Mueller, $2000. As soon as they
discovered the alleged fraud Koehncke
says he made a demand on Kapp for the
return of the money, but Kapp refused
to consider his demand. Koehncke then
filed suit against Kapp to recover tha
sum and the arrest of the defendant fol
lowed.
In the affidavit upon which the arrest
of Kapp was ordered Koehncke alleges 1
that on March 16 last Kapp solicited his
aid, together with that of Karl W. Muel
ler. Alfred Fuhrman and Ernest O. Wa
kens, and prevailed upon them to buy
stock in the saloon, restaurant and the
ater at 1200 Market street, which Kapp
claimed was worth $20,000. Kapp said, it
Is claimed In the affidavit, that during
two months and twelve days from Janu
ary 1 to March 12, his profits were $4379 5G.
These statements were false and fraudu
lent, Koehncke alleges, and says that in
stead of producing the profit alleged by
Kapp the business went behind in the
sum of $4000.
"C. H. Koehncke's action In causing the
arrest of Charles F. Kapp -wasT simply the
result of malice," said Attorney Henry C.
McPike, who represents the defendant,
yesterday. "Under the statute the arrest
of a person may be procured In a civil
action If the same Is based on allegations
of fraud. I have been asked -whether
the arrest was caused by rumor that
Mr. Kapp was going to leave the city. Mr.
Kapp Is here at his permanent place of
residence and here he intends to stay. He
will fight this case through 10 the end
and we do not anticipate defeat."
Kapp's Attorney Denies That His
Client Has Any Idea of XÂ»sa.v

Nearly Seven Million Pounds Shipped
to Can Prancisco in July and
August.
The imports of tea into the United
States by way of San Prancisco during
the months of July and August of this
year have been large beyond precedent.
In the month of July 3,030,277 pounds
passed through the Custom-house, and in
August 3,412,197 pounds were received,
making a total of 6.642.471 pounds, as
against 1,680,574 pounds received during
the six months ending June 30.
Port Collector Jackson explains the in
creased tea shipments by way of San
Francisco on the theory that there is a
large saving of time and money to the
importers by having tea shipped from the
Orient direct to San Francisco, which
would not be the case by the roundabout
way of New York.
The customs receipts at this port for the
month of Ausust were $G9G,223 33, of which
amount $341,219 70. nearly one-half of the
whole, was paid as duty on tea at 10 cents
per pound. .â¢â¢-*- : "--""; ,.

and peats at the tables were at a pre

Keon were on the floor all the evening
selling tickets for a raffl'; of a gold watch.
If they did not sell everybody a ticket it
was not for the want of persuading. Gus

man who wants to find the freight agent.
The large Jewelry firm of Klune & Flo
berg of Sacramento this evening swore to
a complaint charging Garslin with ob
taining money under false pretenses and
Chief Sullivan said to-night that he would
cause to be sent out to-morrow descrip
tions of Garslin in the hope that he may
be captured and returned to Sacramento.
Garslin was a swell dresser and an all
round good fellow. He sought the com
pany of the gay youth ot the town at all
the fashionable bars every time his duties
called him to Sacramento, which was
often. On the occasion of his last visit
he asked one of his companions, a well
known young Sacramentan, to accompany
him to the jewelry store of Klune & Flo
berg on K street. The friend complied
and Mr. Flobers; was favorably impressed
by Garslin's appearance.
I want the finest watch and chain you
have in stock," said the hiph-rollins
freight agent. Mr. Flobore picked out a
timepiece and chain at the neat figure of
$224 and hoped they would answer. Gars
lin was delighted with the selection and.
bringing' out his checkbook, drew a draft
on a bank In Amsterdam. N. Y., for the
amount and presenting it in payment took
the watch and chain and departed. Pie has
not since been seen. F'.oberg soon found
that the draft was entirely worthless.
This is said to be only one instance of
Garslln's methods, but those among the
sportive young men of the town who are
said to have been his victims are not
disposed to Jncur the derision of their

Eight thousand people who witnessed
Pain's military spectacle, the battle of San
Juan, last night at Sixteenth and Folfjom
streets pronounced it a magnificent pnA
ductlon in every detail. The battle scene
was extremely realistic and the various
incidents were followed with intense in
terest. The crowning event, when the
Spanish soldiers surrendered their arms
to their American antagonists, quite
quickened the patriotic pulse of the multi
tude. Applause and cheers were frequent
throughout the Interesting performance,
to present which successfully requires the
services of 700 people.
The entire southern side of the big lot
is taken up with huge scenery, depicting
Ran Juan Hill in the center, with the sev
eral blockhouses and the tents of the
Spanish officers on either side. The
reveille Is sounded and reinforcements
march in. The field hospital, with two
Sisters of Charity, is shown, together
with the burial of a soldier and the salute
over his grave. After the arrival of Gen
eral Linares sports of camp life are en
joyed until the arrival of a courier with
news of the intended attack by the Ameri
cans. The Spanish troops get ready and
are attacked by the American force, which
storms the outposta and captures the
small blockhouse on tho hill. Then fol
lows a terrific bombardment and cannon
ading, which lasts several minutes. After
a hand-to-hand encounter following the
charge of the Americans up the hill the
Spaniards surrender to the tuno or
"Dixie," played by the park band.
The grand fireworks display, which fol
lows the battle. Is not the least interest-
Ins: feature of the production. Some fine
bombs and rockets were fired, and the
management demonstrated that It haa
fireworks to burn. Great numbers of col
ored aerolites, shells, aerial novelties,
showers and canopies were sent skyward
and provoked the admiration of the spec*
tators. The salvo of repeating shells,
opening red, changing to white and finish
ing blue, was a favorite one with the
crowd. The set pieces Included a trapeze
performer In colors, who went throuph ah
the evolutions, and portraits of McKinley
and Roosevelt, which were roundly
cheered.
There will be no performance to-night,
but to-morrow night extra features will

Tho sixty-first anniversary of the birth
of the late Henry George, the apostle of
the single tax, was fittingly observed last
evening in Metropolitan Temple by local
followers of his teachings. A fairly large
crowd attended the effair and listened
with deep interest to and applauded the
speakers. Stephen Potter presided.
Speeches were delivered by Joseph Leg
gett and James G. Maguire, who were
personal friends and treat admirers o(
the famous political economist.
In his Introductory bpe<Â»ch Mr. Potter
spoke of Henry George as the apostle of
humanity, who consecrated his life to the
roign of justice on earth.
Miss Ella McCluskey, a cousin of Henry
George, rendered the "Holy City." She
was accompanied by Harry Wood Brown.
In introducing Mr. Leggett to the audi
ence the chairman said that when Heniy
George had solved. the problem that he
had given himself to solve he gathered
his friends around him and submitted the
solution he had arrived at for their con
sideration; that they formed a society and
that society elected for its president Jo
seph Leggett. He said Mr. L^ggrett had
by his zeal and hard labors endeared him
self to the workers in the cause of single
tax Mr. Leggett in part said:
"Power is always In the hands of the
masses. What oppresses the masses is
their own ijrnorance and selfishness. The
great work for the present for every man
is tho work of education and propagation
of ideas.
"It was elven to Henry George to be
able to determine the state of thoupht
among people. I believe that this marvel
ous power to determine by observation
was largely due to the fact that he made
it an invariable rule all through his life
to follow truth wherever she might lead
him. Truth, I believe, gives a certain
spiritual insight to all her votaries, but
Hrnry Oeorpe loved truth with a passion
ate fondness. He was loyal to truth and
Fhe bestowed upon him a larger degree
of that faculty than upon any man It has
been my privilege to know."
Tho speaker then told at length of the
success of single tax abroad and in this
country since the death of Henry George.
He lamented the fact tnat although Hen
ry Cr^orpe was one of the greatest citi
zens San Francisco ever had in her midst
tho montion of his namo In this city woulJ
not raise a demonstration.
Jumps G. Matruire nclivered a brilliant
speech. Ho paid a beautiful tribute to hla

HE LATE CHARLES SINGH
OLEXWOOD SPRINGS. Colo.. Sept. 1 â
The question of the transportation of Gov
ernment troops bobbed up at the meeting
of the. railroad officials here to-day and
has. temporarily at 'east, obstructed the
progress of the formation of a transcon
tinental passenper association. The com
mittee, to formulate a plan of organization
reported this morning and the main bodv
proceeded to discuss the outlines. Ail
went well until some one asked what'ar
rans'ment had been provided for the
handling of troops by the prospective as
sociation. The point was raised that by
a recent order of the quartermaster gen
eral of the United States army all troop.-?
must KO by way of the Southern Pacific
from Opden to San Francisco, all things
bfing equal. It was explained that the
reason for this order was that the South
ern Pacific was indebted to the United
States and this was the only way the debt
could be canceled. It was suggested that
the working of this order would he dis
pleasing to the Santa Fe people and
might draw away the support of the
northern roads and those reaching tide
water through Texas from the associa-
The discussion was carried late Into the
night and will be resumed Monday. Four
committees were appointed to arrange the

A WEIRD Chinese ceremony, per
formed by the light of flaming
torches in the Mongolian cemetery
Friday night, was witnessed by a
large number of the residents of
Chinatown. The ceremony constituted
the manner by which the bankrupt Fook
Tat Lottery Company took oath that it
v,as paying its debts on an honest basis
and that Its creditors were not being
worsted intentionally. The severing of a
rooster's head from its body in the pres
ence of the dead by the officers of the
company was the solemn evidence that
the truth alone had been spoken. All par
ties concerned returned to the city and
without a murmur accepted 53 cents for
each dollar they had won.
The Fook Tal Company existed in
Chinatown for a number of years. Within
was true. Accordingly, on Friday nijcht
a body of robed priests led the march
from Chinatown to the Chinese ceme
tery. One of them carried a rooster and
another a huee knife. Following came the
lottery men and ticket holders and in the
rear drew up hundreds of pig-tail wear
ers, who regarded the sight of the solemn
ceremony as one of the great events of
their careers and one of the most sacred
that has ever been performed in this city.
In the center of the burying ground,
with tombstones all around, the strag
gling procession halted. The glare of the
torches carried by the children and as
sistant celebrants was the only light cast
upon the spectra! scene. When the ritrs
had been read, the president of the com
pany raised the knife and spilled the
fowl's blood and his oath was made.
The party then returned to Chinatown
and the creditors were satisfied with the
pro rata that they received.
the last ten months, however, it has lost
over $100,000. The last big losing reached
$,"?5,000. and this put the company out of
business and closed its doors.
There was but $2S,000 in the treasury to
meet the demands. $20,000 of which was
soon paid out. The holders of tickets
calling for the remaining $13,000 clamored
for their coin, but were informed that as
only half of that amount- remained they
could only draw about 53 cents on the dol
lar: Immediately dissatisfaction arose
and rumors of corruption spread through
out the Chinese quarter. The holders of
the tickets claimed that the company
could meet its obligations in full, but was
reserving some of the coin to commence
business again at a date in the near fu
ture. %
The officers of the concern resented this
imputation and offered to take the moat
solemn oath known to the Chinese relig
ion that what they represented to be true

POLICE SCENT A
BOLD CRIME IN
WOMAN'S ARREST
Loy Hoy's Cries Save Her
From Being Victim of
Abductors.
Arrested by Napa County Deputy
Sheriff, but Rescued Before She
Could Be Smuggled
Out of Town.
Â«
"What is supposed by the police to be a
bold case of abduction was frustrated by
Special Policeman Sam Daggett at Kearny
and Washington streets last night. A
Chinese woman, Loy Hoy, a resident of I
Baker alley in 'this city, was arrested by
Deputy Sheriff Charles Gibbs of Napa'
County, on a warrant for petty larceny,
.'-â¢worn out in that county by Ah Sing,
thrown into a hack and headed for the
ferry. Her cries attracted the special
policeman and he took the entire party
Into custody and placed the matter in
the hands of Sergeant James Donovan of
the California-street police station for in
vestigation.
Yesterday Gibbs came to the city armed
with ihi! warrant, lie was accompanied
by Wong Chat, Ah Sing's city agent. The
deputy sheriff did not go to police head
quarters and state his business, but con
tented himself by simply getting the war-
rant indorsed by one of the justices of
the Peace.
Last night he started out with the
Chinaman on a search for the woman. She
whs found on Dupont street, taken to
Washington and Kearny, where she was
placed in a hack and the command given
to drive at once to the ferry depot. The
woman's screams alarmed the neighbor
hood and caused the arrest of the entire
party.
The police believe the warrant was
sworn out for no other purpose than that
of kidnaping the, woman. It Is dated
August 30 and alleged that Loy Hoy com
mitted the crime of theft In Napa County.
George Downey and Gus Finn, special
policemen in Chinatown, have known the
woman for a number of years and swear
that she has not been outside of the coun
ty for the past three years. In this state
ment they have the corroboration of a
number of other persons.
The case may have grown out of the
Impending trouble between the Hop Sing
Tong and the Suey Sing Tone. Chinese
who are acquainted with the affairs In
their colony came to the police station
and at once Identified Wong Chat as. one
of the leading members of the former or
ganization.
At the Central station shortly a^ter 1
o'clock Wong Chat exposed the entire
affair as a clear case of abduction, by
stating that ho did not know the woman
Deputy Sheriff Gibbs says he identified
her as being the person named in the
warrant, but when pressed closely he told
the truth about the matter. All the par
ties concerned were later given their lib
erty by the police.

rounded them, but after a few minutes
quiet wa.s restored and a tight prevented.
â¢ Although Newforii continued to use pro

The two factions locked horns at the
] v<tv beginning of the meeting. Charles
i L,. Franklin read a report from the dls
Â¦ trlct commltteexnen of the Twenty-eighth
; District certifying to the election of Kelly
p and Crlmmlns' handy men in that politi
cal division. A. Ruef moved that tne re
; port l.e placed on file.
A prolonged discussion followed on the
! main jÂ»oint at i^sue.
A rollcaJI was demanded on Ruefs
motion. Thirty-six members of the coni
! mittee voted aye. giving their support to
! uphold the careful, conscientious work of
: the returning board. Forty-seven mem
i ners voted in the negative. Â»i was during
I this rollcall that New ford caused the dis-
I turbance.
Ruef Moves to Reconsider.
J . A motion to accept Franklin's report
was carried. Ruef pave a notice of a mo
tion to reconsider at the next meeting, he
having voted in the affirmative for that
! urpote. I. J. Ascheim moved an irame
Â¦ liate reconsideration, and the motion was
I icst. Ruef contended that his notice of a
i motion to reconsider would prevent fur
ther action upon the report. Franklin
offered a resolution that credentials be
issued to the delegates named in his re
port. The same wrangle followed as be
fore, and it was not until 10:30 o'clock
! That the first district was disposed of to
' the liking of the Kelly-Crimmins faction
by the adoption of the resolution.
The majority carried Its point, but
Ruef succeeded in getting on record his
notice of motion to reconsider.
L*-on Samuels reported the election of
the Keliy-erimmins ticket in the Twenty
ninth District. The same tactics were re
sorted to by both sides. As before cre
dential? were ordered issued to tno dele-
I pates named in the report, and Ruef pave
! notice of motion for reconsideration.
Other District Reports.
The report for other districts followed
| more rapidly, as the factions agreed that
the motions be grouped and that the no-
I tlces for motion to reconsider be recorded
j in each case. Considerable discussion was
; had on the report from the Thirty-first
â¢ District. Ruef stated that Committee
men MeMahon, Offerman and Sullivan haa
recognized the authority of the returning
board and had announced their intention
to support its report. He denounced their
double dealing, and said he would contest
the seating of their delegation in the con
! vention.
In every case the reports of the Kelly-

Federation of Mission Improvement

Phelan's Administration.
At the regular meeting of the Federa
tion of Mission Improvement Clubs held
last night the movement to add a $1,000,000
debt to the burden of the taxpayers for
a new roof on the City Hall was charac
terized as a job.
The recent acts of the School Board
were denounced as tending 1 to demoralize
the School Department. The appoint
ments of deputy Inspectors by the Board
of Public Works to superintend Imaginary
workmen and draw big salaries for doing
nothing were also discussed and a special
committee, consisting of Major B. Mc-
Kinnle, C. F. Kimball, Chris Statler. W.
Watson and Max Popper, was appointed
to Inquire into the political complexion
of the members of the board, all or whom
are said to be Democrats, with the object
of commencing an injunction suit against
the board to oust It from office, provided
the charges can be proved.
The law committee reported that an
amendment to the constitution abolishing
the poll tax should be asked for; also that
the harbor front should be taken out of
the hands of the State and given to the
San Francisco municipality. The sprin
kling of the county roads during the sum
mer months was recommended.
Mayor Phelan's Board of Public "Works
pave a black eye yesterday to his scheme
for placing a $1,000,000 mansard roof on
the City Hall. To ' pave . the way the
Mayor furnished the Examiner with an
impeachment of the present City Hall
roof, which was declared to be "nothing
but fourteen acres of cracked concrete,"
in such bad condition that the only salva
tion for the hall was in the proposed man
sard raid. Yesterday morning two men
and a boy went up on the much-maligned
roof and before the sun was low had been
over one-half of the roof and had sealed
up hermetically all the cracks In that
half. By to-morrow night or Tuesday
night at the latest the roof will be water
tight from end to end.
This work, which is being done by di
rection of the Board of Works, Is a direct
though unpremeditated stab at the Mayor,
and the dose is made more bitter by rea
son of the fact that the board has en
tered into a contract with B. S. Harri?
to keep the much-maligned roof in repair
for a vear. The contract with the roof
mender was the result of the following
communication received from Harris by
the board:
â¢'I trill reimir all lenkn and keep
the roof in it riiuiI and Yvater-tlRlit
condition until March 1, 1001, for
S7OO, the payments to be made un
der the following: conditions: I
will repair the roof at once, and
upon repairing all leaks and keep
ing the roof In a good and vrnter
tinrlit condition unlil Mareh 1, 1!>OI,
you are to imy me S.'l.'o on that date.
If I sIimII have kept the roof In a
good and vrnter-tiBht condition; to
your entire satisfaction) until March
1, I!M!1I. you are to pay me S?!$JÂ»O on
l lint date. It In understood that in
ciiko a leak should appear at any
time I am to repair the Maine imme
diately, nnd if at any time I fall to
keep the roof in a condition entirely
to your satisfaction you can declnre
Ihltt agreement void and cancel all
payments therefor.'*
The board Immediately recognized the
futility of spending $1,000,000 when the
present covering to the City Hall could
be kept water-tight on such reasonable
terms, and after making a few slight
changes in the terms Harris' proposition
was promptly accepted in the following
communication:
"Yon verlmlly offer to .tciiiiiic
elmrEre of the entire roof of the
City Hall, inclndins the cornice
;-:iÂ«l nut inel titling; the Hull of
Kpritrilx, nntl primrniitee to liirnish

offers, in confederation of (he lull

Jane ::<> nt the monthly coninenKn
tton of $0O."
Yesterday morning Harris went to the
roof equipped with some elastic roofing
material and accompanied by his helpers.
Some of the cracks in the cement were
EO tine that they were difficult to tind.
First the liquid roofing was applied. Then
a piece of muslin' was laid upon the
liquid. Then a coating was applied to the
muslin. With this simple mending the
Mayor of this large city and Sam Braun
hart, who has prepared a resolution with
which to storm the I3oard of Public
\Vorks and the city's money-chest, were
given the ha ha.
Mr. Harris has had great experience
with stopping leaks in roofs. That has
been his business for fifteen years in San
Francisco. Many of the large buildings
In the city have been treated by him. Mr.
Harris declared to a Call reporter, who
went up on the roof to talk with him, thar
he knew what he was talking- about and
that he could keep the entire roof water
tight at the price agreed upon. The in
ference is plain that he makes a profit
at the low rate of $2 per day or he would
not have taken the contract.
Sam Hraunhart, who once presented
Chris Buckley with a lap robe, will not
be compelled to accept a waterproof
mackintosh from Chris In return to keep
dry while sitting 1 In the Board of Super
visors under the "yawning cracks" In
the cement roof of the City Hall the com
lnij winter. Neither wiil it be necessary
to put up a $1,000,000 mansard roof when
$60 per month will keep out all the rain.

mRS. NETTIE R. CRAVEN, who
has figured sn prominently in the
long and bitter fight over the late
Senator Fair's millions, has most
probably made her last court appearance.
Long brooding over her real or fancied
claim in the dead millionaire's gold, com
bined with the excessive use of morphine
and alcohol, has. unK-t-s a skilled doc
tor's judgment is at fault, wrecked a
once powerful mind and cast a black
fpell of insanity over a personality which
will ever be- rememboiei as unique in the
annals of strange will contests and claim
ants-. The dread affliction which overtook
Parah Althea Hill-Tt-rry, who strove for
the Sharon estate through many long and
weary years of brain-racking- litigation,
may have overtaken Mrs. Craven.
Sarah Althea' s mind gave way under the
nerve-rasping grind of the Probate Court
and she was sent to Stockton a raving
lunatic. The Fame litigation, bitter and
long drawn out, may, have set the brand
of insanity on the mind of the woman
who sat day after day in the witnes?
stand in Judge Troutt's court and faced
without flinching a crossfire of never
ceasing, cold-blooded interrogation with
Mrs. Nettie R. Craven has been ad
judped a wreck, mentally and physically,
by no less an authority than Dr" Bazet.
On Friday, when her appearance was re
quired in Judge Cook's court to answer
to an indictment for perjury, she was not
present, her physician. Dr. Herrington,
stating that she was so seriously ill that
it would be impossible for her to leave
her room. On this information Chief of
Police Sullivan appointed Dr. Bazet to
look into the matter and make a thorough
investigation and report on Mrs. Craven's
condition. Dr. Bazet's report was re
turned yesterday morning in Judge Cook's
court, and its contents, despite an earnest
effort to kfop thorn a secret, were soon
known to convey the startling information
that Mrs. Craven's brain and body were
both in such a condition as to warrant the
appellation of "wreck." Yet not satisfied.
Judge Cook sent Dr. D. D. Lustig and Dr
Theodore Rethers to make further ex
amination of Mrs. Craven's condition.
On Tuesday next the rpport of these
physicians will hf handed in. and from
present indications it will bear out in
every essential particular the report filed
by Dr. Bazet, At the present Flage of af
fairs neither Dr. Rethurs nor Dr. Lustig
very little of the hesitation which 1
would have been but natural to expec
from a woman who was lighting for ai
immense stake.
JA. SCHAERTZER, assistant' clerk
in the United States Circuit Court,
who lives at 141 Rose avenue, was
shot by L. "B. Skelton at an early
hour yesterday morning in the lodging
house connected with the saloon at Sutter
street and Central avenue, kept by Skel
ton's wife. The shooting was the result
ot Schaertzer's too friendly relations with
Mrs. Skelton.
About three months ago Skelton was ar
rested on a charge of disturbing the peace
because of his boisterous objection to
JSchaertzer visiting the saloon. While the
case ' was pending Skelton alleged that
Schaertzer assaulted him. Judge Mogan
at that time warned Schaertzer to keep
away from Mrs. Skelton, and he kept his
promise till Friday night. He was drink
ing in the saloon and* was induced by
Mrs. Skelton to stay all night in one of
the bedrooms. About 2 o'clock in the
morning Mrs. Skelton rang an electric
bell communicating with the bar and
Skelton answered it. She asked him to
bring two drinks to the bedroom, but he
refused.
Skelton ordered Schaertzer to leave the
place, but his wife would not allow him
to go. Finally Schaertzer started to leave
and Skelton pulled a revolver out of his
pocket and snapped it three times at him.
Mrs. Skelton tried to save Schaertzer by
jumping in front of him, but she was too
late, as tKe revolver finally went off a"nd
Schaertzer sank to the floor with a bullet
in his left groin. He was taken to the
Receiving Hospital, where it was dis
covered that the wound was not serious,
although narrowly escaping being fatal.
Ekeltcn was arrested and booked at the
City Prison on a charge of assault to
murder. After Judge Cabanisa ascer
tained the nature of the wound he fixed
Skc-lton's bonds at $1000 or $10) cash, which
was provided by ex-Judge Graham, his
attorney. He was released yesterday aft
ernoon. Mrs. Skeltcn called at the hospi
tal about 10 o'clock yesterday morning
and remained beside Schaertzer till nearly
3 o'clock in the afternoon, leaving him to
make a brief call on her husband in the
prison, which was a very frigid affair.
When she left she remarked that she was
disgusted at her husband's indifference,
but she did not care. She did not attempt
to hid3 the fact that she loved Schaert

JULIAN ARNOLD'S CASE
UNDER ADVISEMENT
The matter of the application of Julian
Tregenna Biddulph Arnold, charged with
four embezzlements in London. England,
to be discharged, notwithstanding tha
opinion of United States Court Commis
sioner Heacock that he bo extradited,
came up for aignment yesterday morning
before United States District Judge da
Haven. Bert Schleslnger, on behalf of
the prisoner, contended that thÂ« evidence
taken by the Commissioner would not
justify hl3 holding Arnold to' answer if
Arnold were being examined for similar
embezzlements committed In California.
He contended also that the first and sec
ond charges were barred by ths statute
of limitations.
British Vice Consul Moore was repre
sented by the law firm of Comae, I>onrv

ci.se under advisement.

PRINCIPALS IN A SALOON
SHOOTING AFFRAT.
Judge Cook has continued the hearing
of the charges against Nettie R. Craven.
Adolph Sylva and G. W. Simpton for one
week.
Dr. Bazet's report states that Mrs. Cra
ven's condition has been brought about
by excessive use of alcohol and drugs,
especially morphine. Her mental collapse
is, indeed, attributed directly to an over
dose of the latter drug. Whatever be the
result of the second examination begun
yesterday by Drs. Lustig and Rethers.
little doubt is felt by those in a position
to know that they will be compelled by
the circumstances to arrive at the dame
conclusion as to Mrs. Craven's condition
as was Dr. Basel.
judge Cook ordered Lee released on his
own recognizance. The case against Lee
will be finally disposed of next Friday.
cares to discuss the matter, but it ia
known that while yesterday's examination
of the Fair estate claimant was but a
superficial one, yet both doctors left Mrs.
Craven well satisfied* that her physical
condition was t,uch that she will probably
never again appear in a courtroom. Of
her mental condition the examiners were,
owing to the short space of time they re
mained with her. unable to come to any
definite conclusion.
Charles Lee. a contractor at the Pre
sidio, convicted Thursday of having as
saulted his stepdaughter, Margaret D.
Lee, was released from custody by Judge
Cook yesterday. The evidence upon which
he was convicted was given by his step
daughter, who is 16 years of age, but sh-i
has admitted that she committed perjury.
Her testimony was so disconnected that
Judge Cook disbelieved the young woman.
Yesterday morning when Lee appeared for
sentence Judge Cook ordered Miss Lee
sent to his chambers. She was closely
questioned by Judge Cook and Judge
Torrence and finally admitted that she
had not told the truth.
"A soldier assaulted me," she said; "it
was not my stepfather.".
When questioned as to her reasons for
testifying against her itepfather she. said
she first told her motner that her father
had assaulted her. When she told the po
liceman who subpenaeil her that her
father was not guilty of the offense sho
says he told her that she had best tell
the truth. From this she inferred that
she .must tell the same story that she
told her mother.

The Road Will Extend Sixty Miles
North From Ukiah and Tap

Forests.
Activity !n railroad affairs Is not con
fined to transcontinental lines. This
Ftatement Is verified by the fact that the
California Northwestern Railway Com
pany, lessee of the San Francisco and
North Pacific Hallway Company, has
finally decided to begin the long contem
plated construction of the line northward
from Uk:;.h.
The company has for months been con
fidering the proposition and has had a
number of surveying parties in the field.
They have surveyed lines from Clovcrdale
to tho northwest, from Hopland to the
vest, from I'kiah to vhe west and from
the san;e point to the north. The latter
line was adopted by reason of the fact
that it will tap the greatest belt of red
wood limbir v.ahin a radius of sixty
niies from L'kiah.
There is r.o .jiiestion of the Intentions of
the company to build the road. Yesterday
the railroad officials siKr.ed a contract
w.-ith the Slulrs, who built the proat imir.ei
for the Valley railroad, to construct the
first ten miles of the line. Work will be
Â£in mxt week and the contract calls for
the completion or the section within sixty
cays. The necessary material is now a"t
Tiburon and will be sent to the front at
ence.
The first section will reach Willits, and
the remainder of the road will be con
structed as faÂ«t as the facilities of tie
company will permit. The sixty miles of
.i:nÂ«* wiil open the Hound Valley country
And touch the southern borders of Hura
boldt and Trinity counties. passing
through a marvdously rich timber coun
try.
According to President A. W. Foster,
the California Northwestern Company
does not consider the short line that runs
F'lUth from Eureka as having any bearing
on the enterprise of his concern. Nothing
Is said regarding the possibility of the
mad eventually becoming: the Pacific
*""ast terminal of a transcontinental line,
and the only . xplanation of the company's
activity at the present time is the fact
that tUe proposed road will open v.p a sec
tion of country possessed of marvelous
natural resources. However, the people ot
the northern section of the State especial
ly will watch the prrpr* ss of the railroad
construction with deep interest.

SPOKANE, Sept. 1.â A report comes
from Eastern Oregon of the intention of
James J. Hill to extend the Great North
ern to San Francisco. Letson Balliet,
said to be a personal representative of
Mr. Hill, Is now at Baker City at the
head of a company building a railroad to
tap the rich copper districts near v there.
The plan is said to be to extend this
road, the Montana, Oregon and Pacific
Railroad, northeasterly from Baker Cfty
to Ballards Landing, on the Snake River,
and thence to tho Seven Devils district,
Idaho. Southwesterly the line is to run
from Baker City to Granite, Prairie City
and Canyon City. Latef the line is to be
extended north and through the Salmon
River pass to the Great Northern at Butto
or Annconda. To the south the line will
be pushed from Canyon City down the
cast slope of the Sierra, , thence through
Feather River pass into Marysville and
thence to San Francisco. The line would
open a marvelously rich mineral, timber
and agricultural country, besides placing
the Great Northern In line to share the
Oriental trade at the California metropo
lis.
Those familiar with Hill's large under
taking believe the report. The Oriental
trade Is his hobby and he realizes that
to secure It he must go to San Fran

NEW YORK, Sept. 1.â Two members of
the cigar manufacturers' combine which
locked out its union employes twenty-six
months ago have surrendered uncon

win a complete victory. The strike has
involved ten thousand persons in this city
and has spread to Philadelphia, Lan
caster, York and McSherrytown. Pa.,
where about 3000 more workers have been
called out in branch factories operated by
members of the manufacturers' combina
tion.
It has cost the Cigarmakers' Interna

to the manufacturers they themselves
cannot estimate. Their factories have
been idle for six months and much of tho
trade lost in that time has been driven
to other firms and to other cities and can
never be regained.

the Union Pacific train robbers were sup
posed to have been surrounded by the pur
puing posse. The "Haystaekp" is about
sixty miles south of Table Rock, where
the train was beld un. and some word
should have been received before this

committed by "Butch" Cassidyj thfe noto

members of his band. At least two of the
robbers were ;ibo members of the gang

LOS ANGELES MEN WIN.
Awarded Two Prizes at the Knlght3
much expression to the love song as does
Berthald. and he fairly carried away the
honors of the tourney of love in the sec
ond act.
Berthald's voice is as clear pjid full as
* bell, and the honor of many recalls was
given him at the close of each act. The
Tivoli. is indeed, fortunate in securing so
finished an artist as Berthald during the
Indisposition of Signor Avedano. Needless
to say that Salassa sang the role of Wolf
ram as only he can. The sympathetic
qualities of the princely barytone were of
the utmost value in the delightful melody
of the song to the evening star, and while
the music of Wagner is not as well suited
to the Latin temperament of the singer,
his faultless style of singing results in a
most pleasing rendition.
Schuster as the Landgrave does the best
Â¦work of his career, and Frances Graham
demonstrated her value by singing the
role of Venus, which is reaily written for
a soprano and not for a contralto. Effle
Stewart as Elizabeth had full scope for
her dramatic power, and., her powerful
stage voice stamps her as one of the best
of dramatic sopranos on the operatic
stage. Excellent work was done bv the
balance of the cast and the chorus. "Tann
hauser" will be repeated to-night. For
next week the bill will be "Ernani" and
"Carmen," which will show the full
strength of the grand opera company.
Â£=T7=?riE largest audience ever gathered
together within the walls of the
H rivoll Opera-house was present yes
terday afternoon at the matinee of
Wagner's music drama "Tannhauser," in
which Barron Berthald, the Ideal Wag
nerian tenor, made his first appearance
this season with the Tivoll grand opera
company.
Long before the doors were thrown open
the announcement was made at the box
office that "standing room only" was to be
had, and when Director Hirshfeld led the
symphony orchestra through the Intricate
but fascinating overture to "Tannhauser"
a remarkable quietude fell over the vast
audience, which consisted mainly of the
fair sex. The rapt attention of the audi
ence/to the harmonies of the overture was
followed by a storm of applause at its
conclusion.
That Barron Berthald is an ideal Wag
nerian singer was fully demonstrated yes
terday. Not only in appearance, but also
in the vigor of his acting as well as in his
vocal execution, he showed a complete
grasp of Wagner's methods. The inci
dental nervousness to a premier appear
ance was poon effaced, and with grace
and ease the tenor sang every number
allotted to Tannhauser. It would be diffi
cult to find a singer who could give so

With honors even at the fifth hole, tne

OAKLAND, Sept. 1.â One-half of the
Republican County Central Com
mittee refused to go into session
with the other half this afternoon,
and one-half of tho committee organized
and elected its officers without the pres
ence of the absent nine. Now the ab
sentees claim that the organization was
illegal, only a minority being present, and
that they will not recognize the new or
ganization. They are even discussing: the
advisability of recognizing the old County
Committee upon the ground that this is
the only legal party organization in ex
istence. The light is a very bitter one,
and may be appealed to the State Central
CommitU'3 lor arbitration. But as it
stands the Pafdee faction has taken the
organization and the opposition has re
fused to sit.
The struggle began when the time for
the' assembling of the County Committee
was reached. There was a great marshal
ing of iorces on the BidewalKs after noon
time, anci every member of the new com
mittee was present except H. E. Brunner
of Haywards. Urunner is one of the com
mitteemen from the Forty-sixth Assem
bly District and is one of the Metcalf-
Nusbaumer faction. As Pardee controlled
the Forty-eighth, i-'illk-th and Fifty-first
districts witn three men each, and the
Muteair-NusLiauir.er forces controlled the
Forty-sixth, fc orty-seventh and Forty;
nintn districts with three men each, it
will be seen mat me absence of Brunner
leit i.-'arciee wmi unit- voted as against
eight lor tne opposition.
mere was ruuen telephoning to Hay
wards, and Brunner announced that his
chiid was extremely ill ana mat he could
iiut attend tne meeting.
This sfiiuusiv interiered with plans, for
Bruimer's vote was necessary. Ail kinds
of claims haa been maae b> botn sides,
Out when it got uown to u case of accu
rately counting notes it became evident
that i3ruiiners vote was necessary to even
inaiie it a tie vote. A. H. .breed, wiio was
put forward by the Pardee taction, de
clared lhat he wouid have ten voces wnen
it came to the meeting and that he would
be elected chairman;
The other laetion decIaPred that it would
have ten votes when it came to a test and
that J. J>. Lanktree would be the nominee
lor chairman.
The Pardee men expected to get the
vote of Dr. H. N. Rowell from the Forty
ninth District and the Lanktree forces
counted upon forcing Joseph R. Kelly to
give them one vote out of the Forty
eighth District.
But when the test came it was very evi
dent that neither expectation was correct,
for Rowell stood with the Lanktree com
bination and all of the Kelly men voted
with Pardee on the organization.
The antl-Pardee forces finally united
upon J. B. Lanktree of Alameda as their
candidate for chairman, both Rowell and
Morrison announcing their Â¦willingness to
support him. The Pardee rnen were al
ways behind Breed, and the tight lined up
as between Breed and Lanktree.
The hopeless but even division of the
committee was shown about 3 o'clock,
when an attempt was made to organize.
The anti-Pardee forces had found that
it was impossible to have Brunner pres
ent, and they made a proposition that the
Pardee forces keep one of their men
away and that they go into committee
and tight It out on the basis of eight
votes to a side instead of nine. This was
refused, and then the anti-Pardee forces*
decided that they would not go into the
committee at all and in a few moments
every one of the anti-Pardee forces drift
ed away except George Wales, T. F. Mock
and J. B. Lanktree. They remained
around to see what would be done.
After waiting nearly an hour and spend
ing the time In fruitless consultations on
the sidewalk- the nine Pardee members of
the committee decided to take possession
of the organization. Those who went up
stairs were: A. L. Smith. A. F. Hemp
stt-ad and James Glover of the Forty
eighth Assembly District; A. II. Breed.
Clarence Crowell and George Randolph of
the Fiftieth District; George S. Pierce. G.
E. Daniels and S. N. Wyckoff of the Fif

Those who refused to go into the meet
ing were: Tom Knox of Murray Town

Township, representing the Forty-sixth
Assembly District; J. II. W. Ryley of
Brooklyn Township, D. U. Toffelmeir of

OAKLAND. Sept. 1.â Barring a fight
over the selection of a new County
Committee and a contest in *.h2
Fifth Supervisorial District for a
nomination, the Democratic County Con
vention held to-day at Germania Hall
was as quiet as life an a farm.
Some of the nominations went a
begging, especially those for Superior
Judges. Few there were among the stal
warts who were ready to lead the forlorn
hope against the Republican enemy. As
it is, Thomas Scott's name ia on the
ticket against his desire.
The candidacy for State Senator was
left open by the convention, and the va
cancy on the ticket will be filled by the
committee, which is casting about for
available material in the Democratic
ranks. Otherwise the ticket is complete.
There was no trouble in finding candi
dates for the Assembly and fur the Board
of Supervisors.
Chairman John J. McDonald of the
County Committee called the convention
to order. Seth Mann was chosen chair
man, S. Bachrach secretary and Henry
Schmidt assistant secretary.
Chairman Mann made a speech, predict
ing Democratic victory in November.
The big fight opened upon the report of
the committee of permanent organization
presented by Chairman Carl Abbott,
which provided for a county committee to
consist of three from each â¢ward and town
ship and ten at large, the latter to be ap
pointed by Chairman Seth Mann.
Warren English mado a battle for a
committee which should be composed of
one member from each voting precinct in
the county. He said that a large body
was more Democratic than a small com
mittee. He would have tho best Demo
crats in the county put on the committee.
They were needed in each precinct If for
nothing else than to purge the register ir.
case of frauds, was Mr. English's view.
Judge A. F. St. Sure of Alameda led the
fight to sustain the committee's report.
He said: "I am opposed to the amend
ment offered by Mr. English. A large
committee is cumUersomc. The old Coun
ty Committee was as Mr. English plans
and the result war- a committee of proxies.
Give us a committee of Pcmocrais that
will attend the meetings. It is not neces
sary to be a commltteoman to work in
purging the great rescist^r."
E. M. Railton, John J. Xlcnonnld. Carl
Abbott and ether delegates joined Judge
St. Sure in his battle. ;*By a larjje major
ity the committee's report was auopted.
M. F. Tarpey addressed the convention,
urging delegates to loyalty and fealty to
the party.

ten members at large, who as yet are to
be appointed, is as follows:

Lady Yarde-Buller Asks for
Removal of Guardian
Greenebaum.
â ? â .
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1US Broadway. Sept. 1.
With the payment cf a noble bill for
large cold bottles and sma.ll hot birds set
tled by the court this week. Lady Mary
Leilah Kirkham Yarde-ItuMer now says
her guardian. W. B. Grcenebaum. com
pels her to live in a squalid shanty with
hardly the actual necessities ot life. She
does :iot state when the transition from
C u iQ " lols " l0 coid crusts took place, but
the v.cxt> h<_-r guardian removed and a
j.ew one appointed w ho will continue to
bear : he expenses niiuraily Incurred b\
fa. iady fcccustonied to "rennet) turrounii
tngjE ir.4 the best attendance."
The lady whose fondness lor the good
things of life lias caused a considerable
shrinkage j:i her once valuable estate is
now residing at Eleventh ami Harrison
streets, where s^ie was instiled by Guar
dian Greenebaum. Her apartments therr
evidently do not afford In r tlÂ»<* opportuni
ties In the gastronomic and "small bot"
line that the chateau at Fleasant v alley
did and she wants a change.
In a petition nied in The Superior Court
this afternoon the requests the removal
<:l W. B. . Greenebaum as her guardian
iind William H. Chapman as trustee of
her estate. She acknowledges consenting
to Chapman's appointment by Judge
B&hrs of San Francisco several dai-s ago.
but says she did not know v.-h:it she wa_s
doh;fe at the time.
The charges against Greenebaum are
That he has placed her to live In a turnbie
(Jown, squaiid shanty containing no car
pets* and furniture valued at less than $2*).
fc'he says he refuses to allow her sufficient
money from her alleged income of (400 a
month to supply the necessities of lifo,
and that her credit is so bad that mer
chants supply her Â¦with food unlit for
consumption.
Her Ladyship, according to her petition,
has a m*iid who threatens to leave her
Â«?mploy if several months' back pay is
not forthcoming. The threatened de
parture of the maid would be a dire ca
lamity, declares Lady Yar<>-Buller. be
cause she could not esi=t without ore.
Lady Yarde-Buller asks the court to
compel her g"uardian to establish her in
a home where she can enjoy her accus
tomed luxuries and "where she can drive
o'Jt for health and nleasure."

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway. Sept. 1. '
Justice of the Peace James G. Quinn anil
Constables John C. Williamson and Ed
ward Weidler no longer occupy offices to
gether. War has been declared, with the
Justice on one .side and the Constables on
the other. The breach was caused because
Quinn claims the Constables discrimin
ated against him in favor of Justice
James L.arue of Brooklyn Township, en
abling the latter to collect fees for most
of the arrests made in Oakland Township.
As a result of the alleged boycott Jus
tice Quinn this morninjj ordered the? Con
stables to remove their desks and other
paraphernalia from hi3 oltice. The order
was obeyed, and within an hour Wil
liamson and Weidler were Installed in a
new office across the street from their
former quarters in Justice Quinn's court.
The trouble arose over the fact that for
about six weeks Deputy Constables J. K.
Taylor and F. Roberts have taken their
prisoners before Justice Larue. thereby
enabling him to collect $3 a head fees for
vagrants taken into custody. Quinn con
tended that he was entitleu to pass judg
ment on the tramps gathered in. and told
j the Constables scj. Instead of disconunu
ing the practice tramps were pursued wim
renewed vigor anil in nearly every case
taken before Justice L,arue. During the
month of August US prisoners were taken
by Taylor and Roberts before Justice Iji
rue, earning at the rate of Â£J apiece, $Usl
for that magistrate.
Justice Quinn said to-day that he or
dered Williamson and Weidler from his
ofiice because he had become tired of the
existing state of affairs, lie said:
"It struck me as not exactly the thin?
for the Constables of Oakland Township
to carry business out of my office to the
office of a Justice of another township,
and I asked Williamson and Weiuler to
remove their belongings. The whole
trouble arose because of my refusal to
issue 'John Doe" warrants."
Constables Williamson and Weidler de
clare that they are not worrying over the
outcome of their trouble with Justice
Quinn.
"We are not In the least dependent upon
Justice Quinn for our fees," said Con
stable Weidler. "He is the one who will
lose. "Why, last month we took 119 men
before Justice Larue, knocking Quinn out
of the fees, and we can continue to cause
him loss. We did not do this originally
because of spite, but because of Quinn' 3
almost constant absence from his office
we had to bring our prisoners before the
next nearest magistrate. Justice Larue.
"This morning Quinn requested me to
discharge deputies Taylor and Roberts,
and when I refused he ordered William
son and myself from the office."

Adjudged Guilty of Selling Pools on
a Prizefight â Will Be Sentenced
To-Morrow.
John Crowley, the poolseller, was con
victed by a Jury ln Judge Cabaniss' court
fast night of violating the ordinance rela
tive to selling pools on sporting events.
The jury was out only a short time, when
it returned with a verdict of guilty.
Crowloy will be sentenced to-morrow.
By the conviction of Crowley, Chief Sul
livan is confident that he will be ablÂ© to
put a stop to poolselllng in this city.
"This is the first conviction of a pool
seller that we have been able to obtain,"
remarked Chief Sullivan last night. "It
is a great victory for the police and wfll,
no doubt, tend to drive the poolsellers out
of the city. I intend to continue waging
war against them, and am confident of
eventually being able to suppress this
form of gambling in San Francisco."

"When straightened out and almost at
the last furlong pole a bad mix-up oc
curred, which fortunately did not result
in a serious accident. Smile swerved out
and Ballyhoo Bey bore in on the other
two, and for a second the crowd in the
grand stand held its breath, expecting to
see one If not all go down ln a heap. This
did not happen, but the favorite was
knocked out of his stride. Spencer had to
pull up, losing four lengths. By the time
the tangle was straightened out Sloan
had rushed Ballyhoo Bey to the front and
was rlulng him out with hands and heels.
WheVi Spencer got Tommy Atkins going
again he set sail for the flying leader,
who was three Iength3 in. front, and with
whip and spur rode a desperate finish.
Foot by foot the game Tommy Atkins
crept up until it was only two lengths,
then one length, then a neck; but the
finish line was too close and amid the
wildest excitement the Judges were passed
with Ballyhoo Bey a head in front. Alard
Scheck was third, a length away. Spencer
claimed a foul, but it was not allowed,
although the stewards had all four Jock
eys ln the stand before giving their de
cision. *Â¦
An unfortunate incident marred the
event and had a direct bearing on the
outcome. Only four horses started and
the ra.ee was conceded to be a duel be
tween the "Whitney und Keene candidates.
Ballyhoo Bey and Tommy Atkins. They
were sent off on the second break to a
good start, and Smile and Ballyhoo Bey
went out to make the running, but not
more than a length separated the four
for the first half mile. At this point Sloan
took his mount back so that Smile showed
in front a neck before Tommy Atkins,
who was the same distance before Alard
Scheck and Ballyhoo Bey. They camo

"The crews which compted are repre
sentative picked men from the several
countries from which they are entered,
and the Â¦winner of each class can well be
termed the champion of the world."
Frederick R. Portmeyer, secretary of
the National Association of Amateur
Oarsmen of America, ln an Interview,
said:
The official times were: Vespers, 6 min
utes 7 4-5 seconds; the Club Nautique do
Gand, 5 minutes 13 4-5 seconds: the Min
erva of Amsterdam, 6 minutes 23 seconds;
the Germanla of Hamburg, 6 minutes
33 1-5 seconds.
The time was excellent, considering that
the race of a mile and 153 yards was
rowed ln roughlsh water and ln a head
wind.
which seemed to envelop them IlkÂ© colls
of rope.
PTTSHE Americans, represented by the
I Vesper crew of Philadelphia, beat the
â¢"â¢ Belgian Club, the Xation Nautlque
de Gand; the Dutch Minerva Club of
Amsterdam and the German Germanla
Club of Hamburg in the great interna
tional boat race at tho Paris Exposition.
It was expected that the race would bo
a hopeless one, but tho form of the Amer
ican oarsmen was such as to inspire more
than hope in tho minds of their support
ers. There must have been quite 20,000
persons along the banks of the Seine to
'watch the regatta, in front of the head
quarters of the Societe Xautique de la
Basse Seine Americans were seen in force.
The American crow lined up promptly
when called out for the race, and at the
word go caught the water first.
The victory was a most popular one and
loud were the praises of the spectators
when the Vespers passed through the
crowd, every one admiring their splendid
physique and the great masses of muscles
ThrouRhout the contest their stroke was
never raided over thirty-four. They
rowed ln a long, clean, beautiful style,
while the strokes of the German and other
crews were decidedly short, their long
backward swlngr having a tendency to re
tard the boat between strokes, while the
American boat RlMed gracefully along,
never at any time losing headway.
They were followed by the Ghent crew
and tho others were bunched together.
Before a dozen strokes had been pulled
the Vespers assumed the lead, and they
increased their distance during the race,
finishing as they pleased by four open
lengths.

Judging from thf fast work of the
hounds In the run-down of the open stake
at Union Park yesterday, the finals should
produce some clever and exciting cours
ing.
As fast a bit of running as was ever
seen on a coursing field was that put up
by Rude Awakening In a double bye with
Imported iloas. Slipped to a long hare, the
Pasha Kennels' entry kicked the dirt In
Alose'a fac4 from the start Mose, though
moving at a lively rate, seemed anchored,
and his opponent, even after a bad bump
at the escape, ran away from him. The
work will probably have a bad enteel on
the winner In to-day's going.
Old Connemara, whose lire was de
spaired of a few weeks ago owing to a
severe accident, made hla reappearance in
the Held and was the recipient of a great
ovation from his many followers. Tho
many-time stakewinner showed hi3 ap
preciation by taking the nag from Mount
Ida. in easy style. Considering the clever
work of the veteran â and he never ran a
faster clipâ It is evident that he will still
be a dangerous opponent to the fastest
of them.
Annio Hail, a Merced greyhound, beat
Palmilower in a good course. A heavy
play was made on this go, with Palm
ilower a 3 to 1 favorite.
McCarthy's recently imported John Doe
made his Initial run against Buck.
Though he lost the flag-, he made a good
show for the tirst time out. In the first
part of the course John Doe secured most
of his points, but when Buck joined In
there was nothing to It. Five to one was
Quoted against the new dog.
Rusty Gold showed in greatly Improved
form and surprised the wise ones by beat
ing out Curtis & Son's Candelaria, a 3 to
1 favorite. Rocker in a long race went
out to Tyrone Prince, who outworked him
in the latter part of the course. Six to one
was the price on the winner.
Greenhall beat Ollta at even money.
Olita's work of late has been of high class
and she was well backed. Flora McDon
ald showed considerable speed against
Sara.
The favorites for to-day's finals are:
Palo Alto, Flora McDonald. Royal Flush,
Rural Artist, The Grafter, Whitehead and
Greenhall.
The day's results, with Judge John
Grace's official scores, follow:
Are on the Card for the Finals
at Union Coursing
Speedy and Evenly Matched Dog3
Connemara, Though Old and
Disfigured, Is Still in
the Game.

FOR THE STAKE
Real Stormy Sort of Time at Recrea
tion Grounds, "With Umpire
O'Connell in the Center
of the Blast.
Â¦?
San Francisco 9, Sacramento 0.
"Ar.d to him who Judges shall come
' nothing but pain and sorrow, for If he be
| Just he will be cursed on earth but blessed
| In heaven."
All this applies to Umpire O'Connell,
who was called upon yesterday afternoon
: to make two trying decisions. He did not
'Â¦ flinch, and Just because he refused to dls-
I p!ay a streak of yellow he came close to
j being mobbed by anery Senators, whose
i faces looked like package* of boiled pas
j elon.
It always takes two decisions to Inflame
I either the diamond performers or the
i fanatics. They^jcere made yesterday. In
[ the fourth Inning â which lattcriy proved
a regular Potrero outbreakâ two Senators
j had come to tha plate and gor.e their way
i to the benches, unhonored and unsung.
! Then Doyle swatted the ball over toward
the l<^ft field fence. When he stopped tn
; his bag career he found himself panting
< on third.
"You're out." shouted O'Connell. "You
didn't touch first base."
What Lioyle, "Reddog" Devereaux. Stan
| ley and a few other toga flaunt ers said to
! O'Connell alter this would only be under
; stood by dentists. Three minutes of a. su
! perhe.-ited atmosphere bath made O'Con
i ncll firm, and the Senators took to the
' field. The fire was smothered for a min-
I ute, ready to break out with the least
i sort of a fanning breeze.
The breeze soon came, and It developed
Â¦ Into a Kansas cyclone. Ulldebrand hit the
I ball to lianlon pome distance from first,
Doyle rushins to the bag for the put-out.
I In "doing so he blocked Hildebrand. who,
I though he did not beat the ball to the
' Back, was declared safe on account of the
; interference. Interference, perfectly le
gitimate in football, is very bad m:\nners
' in baseball, and O'Connell insinuated as
I much by his derision.
Then what foilowed would make a
Â¦whirlwind feel like a fresh-born zephyr.
! Doyle called O'Connell mean things. Han
i Ion* supplemented Doyle's effort. Eagan's
I reserve force of expletives was brought
j Into action. Mat Stanley clinched his list
I and unbosomed himself of his abdominal
j protector and a few words that were not
' noneylike in sound. One could see the
i Bteam of passion rise from the diamond
' before the climax was reached. This came
i a.s a feint from Doyle, but O'Connell was
] game and he ordered him off the field.
I Doyle went, and sections of the Sacra
â¢ mento team went with him, until the four
! wise menâ Managers Harris and Becbe
; and Captains Pabst and Dennle â con
! ferred. and then the performers decided to
i return and play. O'Connell had his watch
j in hand ready to give San Francisco the
' game.
Up to this point the game was snappy
Â¦ and fast, without much hitting. But. alas
; and alack for Doyle, the mental anguish
i he was forced to swallow got Into his arm
, and the Germans plugged the field with
! six hits. After the Inning was over and
. the dead and "vounueii counted the scorer
told a Ftory of three doubles, by Pabst,
Krug and Levy, and two singles, by Ilil
; debrand and Sullivan. It meant six runs
and the- end of Sacramento. Later on in
the game Pabst rolled out two three-bag
' tiers, which with a. double, makes a rec
; ord for a single day.
The blood of Sacramento's gentle man
! r.ered nine will need much icing if to-day's :
game is going to be a pink tea affair. The
: score:
SACRAMENTO.

knew Electricity was the frreatest cura-
tive agent that would ever be known to Â¦
man. But how to apply It was the ques-
tion. The methods taupht in colleges and
elaborated upoo In medical b^oka, by ex-
periment, proved failures. This failure
was mother to the invention of my Elec-
tric Belt, which must not be confounded
with other devices called electric belts.
Dr. Bennett's Electric Belt
Is entirely different from all othera. I
have discovered ard patented the true
method of applying Electricity to the hu-
man system for the radical cure of the
ills of the flesh. My Belt has soft, silken
chamois- covered sponge, water-chamber
electrodes that <lo away -with that fright-
ful burning 1 and Mistering caused by all
other makes of electric belts if they givÂ«
a current. All others hav? bare metal
electrodes, upon which verdiprria will ac-
cumulate on account of thÂ«Â» chrmical ac-
tion of the current. Verdigris ia a deadly
polpon. My Electrical Suspensory for thÂ«
perfect cure of men's ailments free tr>
every male patient. Some concerns try
to have you bÂ«*!!ev^ they imitate my elec-
trodes nnd BÂ»lt by covering the bare
metal discs with a thin veneering of
chamois or felt through which a current
cannot pass, hut through which verdlgTis
will soak. They tpll you to dampen this
cover, but thÂ«s heat of the body dries it
out tn ten minutes. Then th<Â»y advise you
to repeat the operation; they also advis*
you to sandpaper the verdigris off tho
electrodes.
My Electric Belt Can Â»Â»e renewed

MRS. DR. CLARK.
The Well-Known Trance Medium.
1% Turk street, near Jones.
Are You in Trouble?
Bad health, business worry, family difficulties,
legal complications or under evil influences?
Mrs. Clark will help you. She deals with life
and its practical bearings, and many are they
who rise to call her name '-blessed." Her enor. I
tnous and varied experience for years of study
and trave.l ( and, above all, her marvelous power
of knowing all thlnrs at a glance, make her j
advice invaluable. The most complicated dis- \
<&*<Â¦*. bu>-ine!-Â«< entanglement or domestic difrt- j
culty is instantly perceived and the remedy ;
â¢ ,. .. Â¦â¢^- Â¦'.. There is no case too difficult for her |
to handle, as thousands can ie?tiry.
Life in all Its phases she ha? made her one
study. The cau^e of failure, the road to suc-
cess, denominate conilitior.s ar.ci rise above all
man or woman i:eed remain under the clou-1. j
There is always a way out. She will discover
it and help you. ',
Read Her Circular,
Pent free en application with 2 cent stamp, and
lÂ«arn more about the laws of life nnd her own j
l/oculiar and wonderful jwwers than you have
-ver known.
She Gives Advice on Business.
Speculation. sto<-kf>. Investment?, law. etc. Phe
will tell you what trade, l,uÂ«in-.-fs or profession
yr.u are adapted f<>r. Tells you when and whom
you will marry and how to make it a pÂ«.>aceable
and haw-y union. Hat* your lover deceived you?
Or are you in trouble? You can be aided and
all can be made right. Family love and. In
fa'U, a'.l domestic troubles of public or private,
ratiire can fce made right and kept right after
a visit to this inspired medium of modern
tlnu-s. Removes evil influences. She never fails
to unite the separated by proper advice.
Learn the Secret Power of Control.
Have you ever noticed how eome people are
lucky, happy and prosperous in life, while eth-
ers merely exist and are juet as miserably un-
happy? Why Is this? Can you answer? Ask
her and she will tell you why. Mrs. Clark has
devoted ten years cf her life to the study o!
flairvoyance.
Mrs. (Hark has been located in this city for
several yeaâ?, and is not compelled to seek
other locaJitles.
She Has Stood the Test and Is Her* to Stay.
Call and test the doctor to your heart's con-
tent, and you will depart thoroughly satisfied
that there is at least one reliable medium and
clairvoyant now in your midst. Nothing in life
1b too obscure for MrÂ«. I)r. Clark to reveal.
If you have lost faith and given up in despair
because of former failure, take courage now
and call on Mrs. Dr. Clark without delay. Con-
viction will bÂ« sure, and happiness and success
will follow.
Every person is especially adapted to some
particular business, profession or trade which
may Justly he termed his true vocation, and
jet more than half of you are fighting against
an unknown fate or fame,- fortune and position,
which you do not ar.d cannot obtain ur.til you
find your true vocation.
If you are contented with your present work
you have found your true vocation and success
will attend you; but if dissatisfied and all is
going against you It Is an evidence that you
have not found your true vocation. A visit to
Mrs. Dr. Clark will soon Fettle this all-Impor-
tant question, and your true vocation be point-
ed out to you: and if possessed of only a mod-
erate degree of energy and br;iins success will
be pure to attend you. Â£he advises you with a
certainty by a higher than human power as to
the proper "course to pursue in llfc. Her de-
scriptions of your friends and enemies are as
real as thouarh they stood before you. Call and
teft the doctor to your heart's content, and you
will depart thoroughly satisfied that there Is
Ht least one reliable medium and clairvoyant
now In your midst. Nothing In life is too ob
scure for Mrs. Dr. Clark to reveal.
X. B. â Perfect satisfaction Kxiaranteed by
mail. Send stamp fr.r circular, with special
terms. Sickness. Iobsps. death, etc., will be
omitted from your reading at your request;

Upon the return of H. S. Manning from
New York, San FranclÂ»co Lodge No. 3
will proceed to lay out a plan of cam
paign to have the Grand Lodge meet in
this city in 1P02. All the Pacific Coast

Phil Gordon of No. 3 has, returned from
an extended trip through Idaho, Montana
and Washington, looking very much re

A. L. Young of No. 3 has returned from
the Orient. He says that he was on in
timate terms with the dignitaries of
Hongkong, Shanghai, Hangkow and Nan
kin and he natters himself that it was
due to his influence that there were no
serious outbreaks in these places.
Phil Bolger took charge of the Pedes

purpose of piloting It through the trails
of Sit. Tamalpals from Ross Valley. The
start was made at 11 In the morning from
the valley and by the short cuts pointed
out by Bolger the annex at half past 3

Oriental Rebekah Lodge had an open
meeting last Wednesday night. It was
attended by as many people as could well
crowd into the hall. These were enter
tained with the well known hospitality
of this very energetic and progressive
lodge. There was a farce by Belle Nich
ols and Hugh Forbes, vocal solo by Mr.
Harding, selections on the graphophone
by J. Stamp, and a good programme of
dancing, after which lemonade and cakes
were served. Next Wednesday night
this lodge will have a memory test for
members and friends.
On the night of the 15th Inst. Templar
Rebekah Lodge will give an entertain
ment in Memorial Hall of the Odd Fel
lows' building in aid of the hospital fund
of the orphans' home at Gllroy. On that
occasion the Stanley Dwarfs will make
their first appearance in this city.
On the night of the 2Sth the Rebekah
Drill Corps will give an entertainment In
the large hall of the Odd Fellows build

The meeting of Harmony Chapter on
the night of the 23d of last month was at
tended by a large number of tÂ«Â»e members
of the chapter and of visitors, who heard

petitioned to be admitted to membership.
They also witnessed the initiation of four
accepted candidates In a very impressive
manner by Mrs. Emma the
worthy matron, assisted by J. C. Kimball,
the patron, and the rest of the very pro
ficient officers. Mrs. George L. Darling,
she of sweet, melodious voice, whose
notes have charmed so many Eastern
Star audiences, rendered the music of the
evening and won much plaudit. An ex
cellent banquet followed the ceremonies
and there were a number of short talks
by prominent members of the order.
The entertainment that -was given by
the children In Mission Masonic Hall on
the night of the 25th ult. under the aus
pices of Mission Chapter of the Eastern
Star was witnessed by an audience that
tilled the hall to its limit. The perform
ance of the little ones in the way of songs,
recitations, dialogues and marches was
decidedly clever. In the latter the little
ones in a scries of evolutions formed the
central star of the order, also the letters
O. E. S. with living figures, their efforts
being rewarded with much applause. The
"Mother Goose" part of the programme
was exceedingly well rendered.
The reports from all the chapters in the
jurisdiction were due at the office of the
grand secretary yesterday, but a number
of otflcers were delinquent. The sooner
the reports are in the sooner the general
report can be made up.

Last Monday nJght there was a pleas
ant meeting in the chapter room of Olive
Branch Chapter. It had been expected
that there would be work by "the perfect
team of the order" in the matter of initia
tion, but the candidates disappointed, so
the work had to be deferred until the
next meeting. After the meeting there
was served a collation: then there was an
evening of song and instrumental music.
Past Grand Matron Mrs. Annie E.
Briggs is in this city from Hollister, and
she will remain until after the celebra
tion. Past Grand Matron Mrs. Mattie A.
Farnum Is also In this city. She thinks
that she will make this her residence for

Grand Matron Mrs. Ella T. Hall was also

Associate Matron Mrs. Kate Boyd of bac
ramento was in this city last week to
escape the heat of the capital.
Celeina Ciprico. the well-known treas
urer of Olive Branch Chapter, has decid
ed to follow the stage as her vocation.
The lady, who in the past has pleased
m:Â»ny an audience with her extraordinary
power of elocution, has for some time
past studied for the stage and has en
gaged with the Cogill-Cooper Company,
which is soon to start out on a forty
weeks' tour. The lady Is possessed of an
excellent voice, a charming delivery, has
mastered the intricacies of the stage to
the extent that she has a good stage pres
ence, and in fact possesses all the quali
fications that are requisite to make an
actress. She studied for a time in New
York, and so well did she do there that
she was offered a position, but declining
she was given excellent letters indorsing
her ability.
Degree of Amaranth
At the next meeting of Crescent Court
of the Degree of the Amaranth there will
be six candidates for initiation. At the
last held meeting of this court there was

State.
The Odd Fellows.
Grand Master W. W. Watson j-tsitea
Camptonville Lodge at CamptonvWe on
the 21st of August and the following night
he was with San Juan Lodge at North
San Juan. On the 23d he visited Union
Lodge at North Bloomneld. on the 21th
Grass Valley and Goiden .Star lodges at
Grass Valley, on the- 23th Samaritan
Lodge at Washington and on the -Tth
Oustnomah Lodge in Nevada City. He
found that "the lodges Jn the mining towns
have each a good paying memberanip, but
the attendance is not large for the reason
that v.-hen the mines shut down the mem
bers, who are many of them miners, are
forced to leave the district to go else
where to seek work, consequently the
membership is scattered over the State
and there are but few to attend to lodge
work. Financially the lodges in sucn
towns are in good condition and in tho
exercise of fraternity and hospitality the
members cannot be surpassed. Wherever
the grand master hais been on his tour
of visitations he has been most cordially
welcomed. His visits have been pleasing
to the membership, which listened with
close attention to his sound, logical and
encouraging talks.
Ycrba Buena Lodge had "a little time
to itself" last Thursday night. It was
in the nature of an informal affair for
members, to create an Interest In the
lodge. There was a programme of music
furnished by the Knickerbocker quartet.
Professor Yanke. H. M. Bosworth and
Charles Elliott. There were addresses by
a number of the members and It was al
together a most enjoyable event.
Past Grand Master Karl C. Breuck
started for the East --.-esterday to attend
the session of the Sovereign Grand Lodge.
Reports from the southern part of the

George H. Wilson. P. G., the committee,
and were adopted by a rising vote. In
closing the committee pays the following
tribute to their deceased brother:
"On the floor of the Grand Lodges of
several States, in the subordinate lodges
of numerous jurisdictions, in all our coun
cils and committees In California and
elsewhere George H. Morrison, P. G. M.,
stood, in the eloquence of his voice, the
matchless charm of his logic and the
kindly Impulses of a noble heart, the ex
ponent of justice to high and low, good
will to all factions and love for all per
sons. In the hearts of the Odd Fellow^ of
California George H. Morrison needs no
storied urn, no marble bust, no monument
of granite to perpetuate his fame."

James F. McHugh of Washington, gen
eral secretary-treasurer of the Journey
men Stonecutters' Association of North
America, is in the city, and It Is under
stood he â¢will give the mlllmen's strike his
personal attention. He delivered an ad
dress before the San Francisco branch of
the Stonecutters' Association last evening
and spoke In a general way of the mill
men's trouble.
There were no new developments In the
trouble between the mill-owners and their
employes yesterday, President McCarthy
says the Building Trades Council's posi
tion in regard to the Santa Clara mill run
ning nine hours has not been made quite
clear by the papers. He states that only
the San Francisco and Oakland mills were
notiiled that after August 13 they would
be expected to run but eight hours a day.
As the other t.hops. including that at
Santa Clara, were not served -with a no
tice the council could not legitimately de
clare them unfair. McCarthy believes in
first attending to the tight at home. If
any local contractor has been so fortunate
as to have ordered mill work from Santa
Clara the council is not disposed to molest
him.

BALLYHOO BEY MAY
NEVER RUN AGAIN
Badly Injured in the Race for the
Flatbush Stakes at Sheeps
head Bay.
NEW YORK, Sept. 1.â The World to
morrow will say: William C. Whitney's
Ballyhoo Bey, who won the Flatbush
stakes at Sheepshead Bay yesterday, was
cut down and may not run again this
season, if ever. McJoynt, who caused
the injury to Ballyhoo Bey, was sus
pended for the remainder of the meeting.
Foxhall Keene charged Sloan with foul-
Ing Tommy Atkins, declared he would not
start another horse at the meeting and
tried to scratch Voter in the Ocean handi
cap, but was too late. Tod Sloan charged
that the accident was a jockeys' conspir
acy to beat him. Hardly had the race
ended when Foxhall Keene rushed angrily
to the stewards' stand. He was as white
as death ,with anger and excitement. He
claimed a foul against Ballyhoo Bey. Mc-
Joynt was called to the stewards' stand:
Spencer went up without being called,
Tommy Burns went up and Sloan was
sent for. McJoynt said his horse had
swerved through no fault of his. The
statement of Burns and Spencer was that
Sloan, on Ballyhoo Bey, had fouled them.
Sloan said Tommy Atkins and Alard
Scheck had struck his mount.
The stewards refused to allow a foul
and then suspended McJoynt.
After the race Sloan said: "Smile and
Alard Scheck were beaten. McJoynt and
Tommy Burns saw It. They heard Tommy-
Atkins coming up and one or both delib
erately pulled over to shut him off, think
ing It was me on Ballyhoo Bey, but they
shut out Spencer and hurt the man they
wanted to help."
William C. Whitney said: "My colt was
so badly cut that if he was not as game
as he is speedy he would not have won.
He will hardly run again this season. If
he. should come around all right I would
be more than willing to match him
against Tommy Atkins."
