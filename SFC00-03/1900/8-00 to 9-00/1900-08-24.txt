mand of the American contingent of the
International column under Admiral Sey

in the relief of Peking, but which was cut
off by the Chinese troops on the road and

Besides the Hkln and customs dues which are collected through Sir Robert Hart's office In Peking the Chinese
pay a land tax and other duties to the Viceroys of their respective provinces. These are collected by the local Mandar
ins or others specially appointed for the purpose. The collector travels from. place to place through his district, setting
a day beforehand to meet the people. These come sometimes with money, but more often with some product of the fac
tory, the Held or the chase instead, which is taken at the Mandarin's own valuation, usually about 20 per. cent of what
he knows he can get for it at the first general market. It is no unusual thing to see valuable sable furs, common earthen
potr. and even livestock, such as goats, pigs and fowls, among the collector's gatherings. It has been estimated by good
authorities that, while the amount of taxation is ordered from Peking for any special province, not more than 30 per
cent of what is taken from the people ever reaches the Imperial coffers. The collecting Mandarin and those above him
hold out the rest. Â¦ ' - . , . . ...

against one another, and the rift may widen until a peaceful dis
cussion of the Chinese question is no longer possible.
Baron von Sternberg, the German Charge d'Affaires in
Washington, called at the State Department to-day, and, ac
cording to a high official, communicated to Mr. Adee the sub
stance of the reply made by the Berlin Government to the ap
peal of Li Hung Chang. An official whose statement may be
regarded as authoritative said that Emperor William an
nounced that it was not possible for the German Government to
accede to the wishes of Li Hung Chang until it was acquainted
with the character of his credentials and the extent of his pow
ers and the ability of the source from which they spring to con
* fer them.
Mr. Adee's reply on the other hand made its acceptance of
Li Hung Chang's appeal dependent upon the Chinese Govern
ment's demonstration of its ability and willingness to make an
effective suspension of hostilities in Peking and elsewhere in
China, not questioning Li's credentials. Supplementing this
declaration to the Chinese Government, a member of the Cab
inet added that when Li Hung Chang was able to give a posi
tive guarantee that order was restored and that the disturb
* ances would not recur, an American envoy would be sent to
China and an invitation to the other powers to join would be ex
tended to them. Li Hung Chang would then present his cre
dentials and their sufficiency would at that moment and place
be determined.
Administration officials fear that no Chinese Government
will be found which can produce evidence of its power to a suf
ficient degree to satisfy Emperor William. It is pointed out
I that by indirect reference the United States calls attention to
the fact that China's representative must be appointed by "re
sponsible and authorized government," but officials profess to
\ believe that Li Hung Chang's credentials are satisfactory. Ac
cording to the German point of view, since the Chinese Govern
ment has only broken assurances, the powers are justified in sus
pecting any further promises which it may make. Li Hung
Chang's assertion in his memorandum of August 2 r that there
will be "positively no more fighting" has been disproved by re
ports showing further operations on the part of the allies in Pe
king and in the vicinity of Tientsin. It is questionable whether
a government exists which can negotiate peace, and the powers
should first ascertain whether the government which accredited
Li Hung Chang has sufficient power to enforce any agreement
that may be reached with him. It is the President's purpose now.
to. address himself energetically to the powers to secure har
mony of action to bring peace to China.
Mr. Takahira, the Japanese Minister, led Acting Secretary
Adee to understand yesterday that his Government would ap
prove the American note, but this, of course, was merely an ex
pression of personal opinion. Officially Japan has not been
heard from," nor has "Great. Britain. "But it is regarded as certain
by the authorities that these two powers will approve the reply
of the President to the appeal of Li Hung Chang for the ap
pointment of a peace envoy.
The powers, unless skillful diplomacy restores the harmony
which has hitherto characterized their actions, will be arrayed
CALL BUREAU, WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASH
INGTON, Aug. 23. â Germany has injected a serious
complication into the international situation with respect
to China by declining to recognize Li Hung Chang as a peace
negotiator. To this, perhaps, more than anything else is due
the President's decision not to go to Chicago. The attitude of
the other powers on this point remains to be disclosed, but it
would not be astonishing: should at least one and probably two
of the other powers interested in the Chinese situation support

TIENTSIN. Sunday. Aug. 19.â The Sixth United States Cavalry to-day en
raged Feveral thousand Boxers and Chinese troops ten miles west of Tientsin.
Our loss was six men wounded. The Chinese loss was about 350 killed and fifty
prisoners taken. In contrast with the savagery of the Chinese, the American
Furjreor.s dressed the wounds of the Chinese Injured.
The British infantry assisted in burning five villages. The bundling of Gen
eral Dorward resulted in the escape of Chinese, who fought bravely. There
ws? hand-to-hand fighting with the Sixth United States Cavalry, who worked
with the precision of drill.
The Fokinp line ha? bren repaired for forty miles. Peking residents are ex

composed of Chinese and Russians.
SIXTH CAVALRY DEFEATS BOXERS.
LONDON, Aug. 24, 3 a. m. â Fires, fighting them and dis
sension are apparently following in the wake of Peking's
capture. The Daily Mail publishes dispatches from the
Chinese capital, dated as late as August 17, declaring that a great
lire was then raging in the imperial city.
General Chaftee â so it is asserted â maintained that the
Chinese had been adequately punished already and that it would
be unwise to take the imperial palace. This explains the with
drawal of the Americans after breaching three gates. The Rus
sian general, however, maintained that his Government had de
cb.red war against China and that therefore there was no reason,
to prevent his carrying hostilities into the sacred precincts.
Judging' from various and in many cases contradictory dis
patches that have reached Europe this morning from Peking
the commanders evidently adopted a middle course,, for a Reu
tci Â¦ asserts that sentries were* placed to prevent loot
ing. Hence it is presumed that the imperial buildings, al
though captured, will not be destroyed.
The fires appear to be incendiary and to be caused by the
Chinese themselves.
All the dispatches point to the fact that when the latest
message reaching here left Peking the commanders were some
what at sea regarding their future action â all waiting for in
structions from their governments.
The foreign residents appear to have been sent to Tientsin,
although the St. Petersburg co-respondent of the Daily Mail
?ays the Ministers will not leave Peking until negotiations for,
indemnity are under way.
Neither the commanders nor the diplomats were in com
munication with the Chinese Government on August 17. They
were then searching for Prince Tuan.
Among' the puzzling reports as to the whereabouts of the
Empress Dowager is one from St. Petersburg that she is in the
vicinity of Peking, but surrounded. The Emperor seems to have
disappeared completely.
According to telegrams from Shanghai considerable un
easiness is felt there over the fact that no dispatches have been
received from Peking since August 20. Other Shanghai re
ports locate Kmpemr Kwang Su as under the protection of the
allies, and the Dowager as already captured by the Japanese.

PEKING, Aug. 17, 7:30 a. m.â On Wednesday, August 15, the American troops attacked the gates lead
ing into the imperial city. A battery of the Fifth Artillery sent shells from an elevated position on the
gate. The Fourteenth and Ninth Infantry and marines entered below and fired on the Chinese troops. They
then pushed on to the west gate. The American Gatling guns did good work. Gate after gate was blown
in and the Chinese shelled out of them and the infantry rushed in until the tour gates were taken.
In the afternoon operations were halted and a conference of generals was held, which resulted in the with-
drawa! of the American troops. At this conference all except the Russians agreed not to violate the imperial city
and decided that the object of the expedition had been accomplished, pending further advices from interested pow
ers. The Russian general stated that his Government had declared war on China. The military authorities are
not in communication with the Chinese Government. The Japanese, Russian and British troops are now in posses
sion of the Tartar city. The Chinese are now all out. The American casualties were ten killed and twenty-fivs
wounded; - "?Â©

BERLIN, Aug. 23.â A section of the
German press is talking about
Count von Waldersee's "political
programme In China." The corre
spondent 'of the Associated Pres3
learns that such a phase is entirely In
applicable to the case. Count von Walder
see Is going without any political pro
gramme. The German Government is
really carrying on ceaselessly diplomatic
negotiations here and In the capitals of
the powers to agree to a Joint programme
for_ the Immediate present, and the policy
for months ahead Is not even dreamed of
now. The correspondent hears that per
fect harmony regarding China continues
to prevail between Germany and the
United States.
The Cologne Gazette. In the course of
an inspired article, replying to demands
made by a number of German Jingo pa
pers that Germany should seize a goodly
portion of the Yangtse Valley, say a:
"Germany most emphatically does not
harbor any such intention."
Herr Eugene Richter, the Radical lead

Emperor William's whole China policy

show, paragraph after paragraph, that
his policy has been an unbroken series ot
contradictions.
The Cologne Volks Zeitung publishes the
text of the address made by Emperor
William. to the officers of the China troops
going from the .Rhine districts. His Maj
esty is reported as saying that he feared
that the troubles in China might develop
a war between the ,Orient and the Occi
dent. He praised the bravery already
shown in -China by all the nations con
cerned and advised those who heard him
to cultivate good fellowship with all re
gardless of color. He said that Chile had
offered to supply all. the horses Germany
needed and also to send 30,000 men.
Referring to the Chinese he character
ized them as a "cowardly but cunning and
treacherous foe." After counseling the
strictest discipline he said: "Spare the
population, but do not spare those who
oppose you. there In arms. Show the
Chinese there is one- power which means
to punish the crimes they have committed,
irrespective of more distant and more
practical alms."

WASHINGTON, Aug. 23.â The Im
portant development in Â¦ the
Chinese situation j to-day was
the decision of the Government
not to send any more troops to
China. All the troops now at; sea,
amounting to about 4000, together with
those under orders for services in the
Far East, which have not sailed, amount-
Ing to about 3000 more, Â¦will be sent to
Manila. These troops will sail on the
same route and upon touching at, Naga
saki, will go to Manila, unless, there are
developments In China, not now antici
pated, which will make their presence In
that country necessary. Secretary Root
said to-day that no more troops were be
ing sent to China because they were not
] needed. With the arrival at Taku of vthe
Hancock and the troops she carried.' Gen
eral Chaffee will have 5000 available men.
which is deemed sufficient for all present
purposes. The decision of thf department
! was not based upon anj' recommendation
â¢ made by General Chaffee, but upon
reports received by him, which made It
apparent ihat no more troops were needed.
The announcement of the diversion of
the troops was made In the following
official bulletin, which was posted at the
War Department this evening:
"The Government has decided that un
less required by future developments, no
more troops are to be sent to China.
Orders have accordingly been cabled to
Nagasaki for the Meade, which is dfle
there to-day, v.lth four troops of the
Third Cavalry, four companies of the
Fifteenth Infantry and Company E, Bat
talion of Engineers, to proceed directly to
Manila. Similar orders will be given to
the other troops which 'under orders
for China, via Nagasaki." ..
It was stated at the department that the
encouraging conditions In China were the
main reason why the orders of to-day re
garding the troops were issued. Besides
the troops on the Meade. Wiere are now
at sea the Warren with two squadrons of
the Ninth Cavalry and recruits, and the
Sherman with one battalion each of "the
Second, Fifth and Eighth Infantry. .
The Logan is scheduled to -sail on Sep
tember 1 with two battalions' of the'First
and one battalion of the Socond Infan
try. It was said at the War Depart
ment that six or seven" thousand ; troops
would be affected by the order.
A dispatch was received from. General
Cnaffee to-day, dated Peking. August 18,
which was not in response to the request
sent him a few days ago to report the
conditions and requirements.. General
Chaffee did not report further fighting
In Peking and for that reason the Wash
ington officials feel assured . that hostile
demonstrations in " the Chinese capital
have ceased. The dispatch related. to the
transportation conditions and- stated that
the railroad between Taku and Peking
could not be used at the present time,
as portions cf it had been destroyed by
the Chinese. General Chaffee - will co
operate ) with ,the other commanders in
China In reconstructing the road for. the
use of the allied forces. General^ Chaf

GROWING FRICTION
BETWEEN POWERS
At Present/ Howeyer, the Presi
dent-Has No Intention of
Calling Extra Session
of Congress]*
PALL BUREAU, WELLINGTON
HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Aug. 23.â
I j President McKinlcy has no present
1^ Intention of calling an extra session
of Congress to consider the Chinese
situation. Members of the Cabinet am',
other high officials of- the administration
with whom I have talked to-night assure
me that unless there is some unexpected
development in China an extra session
will not be necessary.-
One of, them said: "Affairs in China
have now reached a stage of negotiations.
Congress .cannot carry on negotiations
with foreign powers. That must be done
by thÂ« executive -branch of the Govern
ment. An extra session would only bÂ«j
necessary if the President wanted to de
clare war.Uo raise more money or to In
crease the army. He does not want to
do either, and does not see how Congress
could be of any assistance."
At the same time the President will not
hesitate to call Congress together if the
conditions should become such as to war
rant such action. It. is realized that the
situation In China Is one of grat gravity,
and that it may lead to international com
plications with which the President might
be powerless to deal without the help of
Congress. Serious apprehension has been
caused by the developments during the
past few days, which Indicate a growing
friction between the co-operating powers.
This phase? of the situation has suddeniy
becomc so serious as to cause the Presi
dent to change his plan about g*oing to the
Grand Army encampment at Chicago.

while they were killing his cattle, an<l
they opened fire upon him.
A Sheriff's posse to-day captured the
leader and one of his gang. The other*

During the day wild rumors were cur
rent that mobs were being formed to go to
Cleveland and lynch Peck, but there was
no good ground for them.
Although Mayor Young is criticized
somewhat for his contradictory speeches,
n great deal of the blame for the rioting
Is placed on the shoulders of Chief Harri

Glenn Wade, the boy who was killed,
was in the mob, and a bullet from the
revolver of a policeman In the City Hall
found his heart. Another Innocent who
will die Is Rhoda Davidson. Sitting in a
carriage with her mother and father, on
the outskirts of the mob, a bullet from a
policeman's revolver passed harmlessly
over the rioting throng and found lodg
ment in the skull of the child.
At 9:20 nine companies of the Fourth
Regiment arrived in the city and marched
to the scene of last night's rioting.
Shortly before 10 o'clock Mayor W. E.
Young issued a proclamation, closing
every saloon In Akron until further
orders.
On the advice of his friends. \Mayor
Young sought his offlce by back streets
and alleyways, as It was feared that his
presence so early after the rioting would
cause a fresh outbreak. .
At 6:30 o'clock this morning Company C
of Canton arrived in Akron under riot or

of this city.
The rioters had 'done their awful, work

suffering from the "v/ounds of pistol balls,

was a heap of smoldering ruins, and be

city was disorganized and scattered. The
chief had left the city. Electric wires,
deadly to touch, lay across the streets in
the vicinity of the burned buildings and
debris of all kinds was scattered far. an-i

TOPEKA. Kar.s., Aug. 23.â William J.
Bryan to-day neceived the second
official notification of his nomina
tion for the Presidency. This notl
lkaticn came from the Populist
party and Thomas M. Patterson of Colo
rado aoied as the mouthpiece of the
]>arty in making it. *He was at the same
time informed of the indorsement of his
candidacy by the United States Monetary
league, this notification being given by
}lun. A. W. Rucker. The ceremonies oc
curred In the spacious and beautiful
grounds of the State Capitol and were
Â¦witnessed by a large number of people.
There was the usual contention about the
site of the crowd. It would appear that
there were not so many outsiders present
e.s the Populist managers had countexl
upon, but if this was true, the shortage
was compensated for to a degree at least
by the presence of rer-idents of Topeka.
The crowd wus especially dense in the
Immediate vicinity of the stand on which
thj? notification ceremony took place and
from this center scattered well out into
the srrounds.
In many respects the meeting- paralleled
the Indianapolis notification. This was
true in the fact that both were held in
parks, that the weather was intensely
hot. and in the circumstances that the im
patience of the crowd compelled speakers
rreceding Mr. IJryan to curtail their re
marks. Indeed, not one of the speakers
was permitted to speak at the length he
had evidently counted upon, and as a re
pult the entire proceeding covered only
about an hour and a half of time. Rain
had been threatened early in the day, but
before the meeting was' called to order,
at half past three in ihe afternoon, the
clouds had lifted, and the fear of a
ptcrm which might compel 'the meeting
to be held indoors had given place to
the certainty of fiercely beating sunshine
which was intensified by great humidity
and untemnered by any breeze. That the
reople gathere"! to witness the ceremonies
held their positions as lung as they d:d
rpeaks v.-.-ll for both their patience and
their fortitude. Many of the auditors
found their way to the vicinity of the
Ftar.d an hour or more before the speak
ing began, but they valiantly held their
ground, despite the heat. Many of them
inust have puff-red intensely, for near the
stand thev were densely packed and there
was no JTOtection from the sun's rays.
Ftill. there was very little complaint until
the ceremonies were' well under way and
the crowd laughed and chatted "while
tvaitir.K for the speakers, even while the
perspiration plowed its way over the faces
of the individual members' of it and plen
tifully ocaed out through the clothes of
many of them.
Audibh Sigh of Relief.
There was. however, an audible sigh
of relief mingled with the applause which
greeted the appearance of the national
If8<itr upon the platform when he arrived
at 3:3;"). and it was evident even then
that while? there was general desire to
hear and see him the audience was find
ing the situation too uncomfortable to be
long endurre]. This fact did not, how
ever, detract from the cordiality of the
welcome which was extended. The ap
plause was not prolonged, but It was
? vident that it was from the heart ana
meant cil that it purported to mean.
There was llttletdelay after the arrival
of Mr. Brjiin itnd the other notables.
State Chairman Jtidpeley of the Populous
promptly assumed the chair, and rre im
mediatt ly introduced Hon. James A.
Troutman, who as the representative of
the Mayor t.f Tojeka made a brkf speech
Â» dooming Mr. Bryan to the rity. Air.
Vromman formerly was Lieutenant Gov
ernor <ii the State and he is Republican
in r.n'Hi;?. His six-poh was personally
eoinpimir/mary to Mr. Hryan, and was
JjriU<-.r an cppÂ«ial for the exerates of tne

reiis cs the lirÂ«t safeguard of our ins'itu

Of people" before him as an evidence of
IIM lil^ih regard in which the distinguish
ed visitor is held, and said that while !<e
was noi authorized to assure Mr. Hryan
of the electors 1 vote of Kansas", he c-euild
, assure htel of the admiration of everv
citizen of th*Â» State.
Mr. Troutmai. was followed by Hon.
Frank Dousur. Chief Justice of the State
who extended the welcome of the State
at largf-. He had prepared a speech, but
he delivered only a small part of It be
cause- of the heat and of the evident de
sir* to hear Mr. Bryan. Jud^e Douster
contented himself in what he did say with
contrasting the positions of the Demo
crats and the Republicans on the subject
cf expansion, taking the position that the
Republicans were looking to undue rg
gTession. while the Democrats were seek
ing to Â»ee are the maintenance of Ameri
can institutions. He was liberallv
cheered.
Mr. Douster Rjtfl followed by Hon. Jerry
Simppf-n, who was introduced as the per
manent chairman in the absence of Na
tional Chairman Ilutler. Mr. Simpson
niade a briof Bpeech, confrralulating To
peka upon being sskcted as a place for
thÂ» notification of Mr. Bryan by the
creatcst party as its candidate fo"r the>
Prt-ftidc-noy. He compare-*! Mr. Bryan with
Lincoln, and predicted that ho would lead
the people back to the landmark of hu
man liberty which Lincoln had so mate
rially a?>siste-d in establishing. "Let us
trupt." he .=ai<1, "that Nebraska and Kan
sas. str.r:<31njc side by side as In 1860. will
ap-ain pive. thoir support to a candidate
who has, as the candidate of that time
had. but one oode of morals, which em
liraces. as did Lincoln's, all men of all
times regardless of color or environ
ment. â¢
With this Mr. Simpson Introduced Mr.
Patterson, who as chairman of the Na
tional Pnp^r.ist Convention, became chair
man of the notifi> a t:e>n committee. Mr.
Patterson wa; received with applause
and many of his points were loudly cheer
ed, but. like Judge Douster. he- materially
reduced the length cf his speech because
of the heat and of the impatience of the
eudience. '
Judjre A. W. Ri!ckÂ»r. who conveyed to
Mr. liryan the information of his indorse
ment by â¢ the Knlfd States Monetary
League, had also to yie>ld to the demands
of the &udi<-nce for a curtailing of his re
marks He v.-as. however, piven an op
portunity to be briefly heard and to make
a number of points, which mot with the
approval cf the auditors.
When Mr. Rucker took his seat, Mr.
SUnrrfon lost no time in Introducing Mr.
Bryan, whose voice soon had the effect of
ejuietlng the crowd, lie was reoc-ivert with
a buret of applause when ho arose, but
th* demonstration very soon quieted down
and thenceforth the Interest of the audi
ence was made manifest by the undivided
attention which was given" rather than by
word of mouth or the- clapping of hands
Mr. Bryan read the preattr part of his
address from manuscript, and the deliv
ery occupied about forty minutes of time
bwt the crowd listened intently through
out and without any man'.fesiailon of im
patience or disapproval. When he ceased

Bryan then bcj?a- the rffidJng of tht
address as orlKinally prepared, only stop
ping to interject h few words .in reply to.

paid considerable attention to the money

paifrn united in the demand for the Immediate
restoration of silver by the independent action
of this country at 16 to I, the ratio which had
existed Hlnce 1S3I. They were defeated, but that
did not end the discussion. The Democrats
were defeated in ISsS, but that did not put an
end to tariff reform. The Republicans were
defeated In JS92. but that did not permanently
overthrow the protective tariff. Defeat at the
polls does not necessarily decide a problem.
Experience, and experience alone, settles ques
tions. If an increase in the volume of the
currency since 1S96, although unpromlsed by
the Republicans and unexpected, has brought
imnroveraent in industrial conditions, this im
provement, instead of answering; the argu
ments put forth in favor of bimetallism, only
confirms the contention of those who insisted
that ir.orc money would make better times.
The RepuL*an party, however, while claim
ing credit for the increase in circulation, makes
no permanent provision for an adequate supply
of standard money. It denies the necessity for
more banks to expand the. volume of paper
rÂ«>al money, while It permits national promise*
to ray money.
If tlie Populists felt justified in opposing the
Republican party when it sought to conceal its
gold standard tendencies under the mask of in
hTCTftonaJ bimetallism, the opposition Should
be more pronounced in proportion as the Re
publican party more openly espouses gold
mor.ometa.Hlsm.
In 3S:G the reform forces charged the Re
publican party with intending to retire the
greenbacks. This charge, denied at the lime,
has been confessed by the financial bill, which
converts greenbacks, when once redeemed, into
Kold <-erti flea tea. and extends new privileges to
banks of 1fsuÂ«. If a Populist opposed the
Republican r>arty when its hostility to green
backs was only suspected, that opposition
should b<- greater now, since no one can longer
doubt the purpose of the Republican party to
substitute bank notes for greenbacks.
Militarism aj^d Imperialism.
Returning to his latest topics Bryan
said:
It Is not strange that the Populists should
oppose militarism and imperialism, for both
are antagonistic to the principles which Popu
lists apply to other questions. Looking at
'luestior.s from the standpoint of a speculator,
the Populist recognizes in militarism a con-
Ftant and increasing burden. The army worm
which occasionally destroys a field of wheat
is not nearly so dangerous an enemy to the
fanner cs a large standing army which in
vades every field of industry and exacts toll
from every crop.
If IOa.0M men are withdrawn from the ranks
of the producers and placed as a burden on
the backs of thopp who â¢remain, it must be
knger hours, harder work and greater sacri
fices for those who toll, and the farmer, while
he pays more than his share of the expenses
of the army, has not part in any contracts or
development of companies, and his sons are
less likely to fill the life positions in the army
than the sons of those who by reason of
wealth or political prominence exert influence
at Washington.
At the present rate we will spend annually
upon the army -approximately half as much
jss Â«f spend for education In the United States,
and th's Immense- sum is wrung from the tax
payers by systemsâ of taxation which overbur
den the iÂ»>or and undertax the rich man.
In the presence of such an Issue as militar
ism it is Impossible that any ropullst should
heÂ«|tate to do his duty.
Hut evea the menace of militarism is but a
part of the question of lmrÂ»erialisni. The pol
icy contemplated by the Republican party nul
lities emy iirincirle set forth In the Declara
tion of Independence, strikes a blow at popu
lar government and robs the nation of its
moral prestige. Already the more advanced
pupijorters of the colonial idea point to the
economy of a system of government which in
trusts all thr> pGwers to the executive and does
away vith the necessity of legislation.
The Army and Navy Journal. In its issue of
August 4. commends the English system and
an.ares that &*Â¦ a result of this system a
fifth of the world'* area, containing one-fifth
of its population, is ruied with an adminis
trative economy which is an administrative
marvel.
Thus doe*' lmi>eriall?m bear its supporters
backward, turning toward the dark ages. There
is no middle ground between the American
policy and the Kuropean policy. If this nation
remains true to Its principles, its traditions
and its hirtory. it cannot hold colonies. If It
enters ur>en a colonial career, it must repudi
ate the doctrine that governments derive- their
jui-t rowers from the consent of the governed.
Republic to Monarchy.
In concluding Bryan said:
A republic 1e always a menace to a mon
archy. Just an truth is always a menace to
error. Self-government, being the natural gov
ernment, must necepsarily create dissatisfac
tion among the subjects of those government*
which build upon some other foundation than
the consent of the governed. What the Orange
Free State and republics are to South Africa,
our republic is to the world, and only our In
creasing strength and the wide Atlantic have
protected us from the inextinguishable hostility
which must ever exist between those who eup
port a throne and those who recognize the citi
zen as the roverelcn.
Every step taken toward imperialism by this
nation m**ts with prompt and effective encour
apment from Europe. Lincoln pointed to the
interest which European nations have in the
abandonment here of the doctrine of equal
rights. He said: â¢'The' principles of Jefferson
are definitions and axioms of free society. And
yet they are denied and evaded with no small
show of success. One dashingly calls thorn
'clitterinjf generalities.' Another bluntly calls
them 'solf-evident lies." And others Insidiously
argue that they apply to 'superior races.' Those
expressions, differing in form, are Identical in

<?AN* RAFAELs Aug. 23.â Coroner Eden
held an inquest this morning at Mill Val
ley on the body of E. G. Thomas, the
onpineer who was killed yesterday in the
tr;Ktn WTPck on the Mount TamalpaJs
RsHroad. After listening' to the evidence
of three witnesses, the jury returned a
vrrdict of dea.th by accident, the cauws
of which are unknown.
The simple story told by Section Hand
An:onÂ«Â» Marl an a. who was acting as fire
mÂ«iri a.t the time, ciears the dead engineer
of the charge of carelessness. Mariana
said through an interpreter: "We left the
summit at 7:10 a. m. Everything went
well untii we had gone about four miles.
We were running at the usual speed. As
we came around the curve all the brak*-s
wrre on, but they didn't seem to hold.
Something vea wrong. When the engine
etartod to topjÂ«'e over Mr. Thomas called
to me to jump. He stuck In the sent In
the c,a.b. The engine rollt-d over the bank.
1 wÂ«^nt around below and pulled Mr.
Thomas u".:t. There was lots of steam and
fce wss burned."
Thus the story of the heroic engineer's
dr-ath was told. In the facÂ« of death he
thought of his fireman and barf" him save
liimsHf. while he. with his hand on the
throttle, still struggled to avert the dis
artrr. Marina told with simple modes;y
of his gallant action in crawling up the
hill and amid whirling wheels and clouds
of scorching Fteam effecting the rescue oi
the bruised ar.d blistered body of the en
Â£â¢:; eer. Marina was the only witness who
tcstiried as to th^' condition of the road,
lio said he thought it was good.
\V. J. Thomas, a brother of the dead
engineer, testified that the- deceased was
employed as master mechanic of the
mountain road. L>r. Spottiswood testified
as *o tho injuries of the deceased.
There waM a strong feeling in Mill Val
ley this morning over the charge of care
lessness on the part of Thomas, which
waf not made until his death was cer
tain. The company regarded Thomas as
or.e of its best engineers.
AftÂ«?r the inqur-et the bodv was ta.ken

place at Cypress Lawn Cemetery.
ENGINEER THOMAS IS
FULLY VINDICATED
From the sound of the gong in the^rst
round to the sudden ending in the thir
teenth Tremble faced his opponent with
courage and confidence. The fight was
pretty much the same one round after
another. A few swings by Murphy that
found the air the resisting substance and
some straight left leads by Tremble. In
the third round Murphy tried to rush
matters, but he was soon brought to a
stop by Tremble's left hand, which seemed
to stick out threateningly.
The eleventh saw the fiercest fighting
of- all. Tremble poked his left fist
into Murphy's face so often and hard that
he reopened the old cuts about the mouth.
Murphy's face wore a general choppy ap
pearance long before he administered tho
quieting blow to Tremble. For a time !n
this round it looked as if Tremble was
going to finish his opponent. But there
was one thing lackingâ ring experience.
While appearing as the better fighter.
Tremble came to the front In the thir
teenth evidently determined to ease up in
his work. The steam seemed to leave
film, and he could not get together when
Murphy started a bit of rough house
According to agreement the fighters were
not to hit In the clinches. By clumsy,
low clinching Tremble put himself re
peatedly in the way of a right cross in
the break. In the fhirteenth the cross
landed, and that was the beginning of the
end. From one end of the ring to the
other Murphy battered Tremble, until
Tremble went down on his haunches and
out.
The preliminary between Tomm\ Cox
and Toby Irwin was a painfully dragged
out affair. Irwin was afraid at all times
to mix things, and kept backing up so
steadily and continuously that the stage
could hardly hold him. When he did dis
play a disposition to mingle he battered
Cox with right and left. Cox's eyes were
moused early in the fight, but this did not
prevent him from boring into Irwin. All
the aggressive work was done by Cox,
Irwin trusting to counter efforts in one
of the four corners.
Jack Welch refereed the principal event.
JIM TREMBLE, Tim McGrath's new
protepe, gave a good performance
âfor a noviceâ with the gloves last
nipht at Woodward's Pavilion, but
in the thirteenth round he was clipped
on the point of the chin by a right cross
from Tim Murphy and this ended him.
Dazed by the blow. Tremble was at the
mercy of a rainstorm of left swings and
light hooks that followed. They carried
him to his corner after ten seconds' pain
ful waiting.
The preliminary between Tommy Cox
and Toby Irwin went the fuU distance of
twenty rounds. Referee MeGuiley handing
the fight to Irwin, much to the dissatis
f.ictlon of the public But Cox seemed
satisfied, so the discontent was stilled in
the bud. Both fights were before the Co
lumbia Athletic Club. * â¢ ' *
Jack Tremble and Tim 'Murphy were
evenly matched and the contest was a
very close one until the fatal round.
Tremble had a shade the better of It, If
anything. Confident, willing and anxious
lo put His gloved flFts on all parts of
Murphy's anatomy, lie made a good show
ing for the tyro that he is. Murphy with
all his rir.g experience was at jio time the
proncur.ctd superior of his antagonist,
i'rf-mble'fi lack of ring knowledge and ring
tricks is what lost him the battle. On
two occasions he had Murphy in vague
thought, but he was not wise enough to
follow up his advantage.
Murphy wasted more good punches and
exhausted more driving steam than would
suffice to lay low an army of warring pu
gilists. The swings let loose by the Aus
tralian that did not connect were too
many to count.. Murphy has adopted the
l.alf-op*Â»n jackknife position, with his
head stuck forward like a turtle's out of
its shell. Several timfs he was straight
ened up by stiff punches from Tremble's
straight left. Altogether Murphy has not
proved himself anything on the miracu
lous order of pugilist.

NEW YORK, Aug. 23.â Personal feeling will figure very largely In the bat
tle between "Bob" Fltzsimmons_and "Tom" Sharkey, which will take
place before the Seaside Sporting Club at Coney Island to-morrow nigrht.
This feeling between the sailor and the former blacksmith dates back to
their meeting in San Francisco several years ago, when Sharkey was
awarded the decision on a foul. Fitzslmmons has always claimed that he was
robbed of the victory on that, occasion, and says that the battle to-morrow
night will bear testimony to the truthfulness of, his statement.
â¢ Sharkey and Fitzsimmons took the final work for their contest at their re
spective training quarters to-day.
"The smart fellows seem to think," said Sharkey. "that Fitzslmmons won
a great battle when he defeated Ruhlin, but I do not think he fought well at
all. He was very unsteady at times, and Ruhlin had at least a dozen opportuni
ties to beat him. I think if I had been In Ruhlin's place that night I, should
have got the decision over Fitzslmmons in the first round.
"If he goes to slugging the way he did with Ruhlin, I'll bet that I put him
to sleep in less than five minutes. I am Just as good a man to-day as when I
fought Jeffries." . .
Fitzelmmons is in better shape than when he fought Ryhlln. His skin has
a better color and his eyes are clearer.
Fitzslmmons remarked to a friend: "It will be all over inside of ten mia
utes. I beat Sharkey, without any trouble before, although I did not get credit
for my vlctorv. But I . will prove when I meet the sailor to-morrow night that
I am his superior in every respect. as a fighter.
"Sharkey is essentially a slugger, who has got to get in a set position In
order to deliver a blow effectively. His greatest stock in trade is his hitting
power and his ability to take punishment.
"Sharkey can unquestionably hit as hard as any other heavyweight In the
ring ana is always dangerous. One blow from Sharkey is apt to win a fight
for him. He is by no means clever, however, and depends on bull-like rushes
to give him victory. Sidestepping and other finer points of the game which
! Sharkey has been trying to master, cannot be learned and perfected In a
month; It takes years of hard practice to develop such points thoroughly. I ex
pect to defeat him: and do the trick with neatness and dispatch."
NEW YORK. Aug. 23.â Sharkey
Is unquestionably a very plucky fel
low, and you have got to knock
him cold In order to make sure that
he remains down on the boards
long enough to be counted out.
But I'll find no trouble In accom
plishing that feat.
ROBERT FITZSIMMONS.
NEW YORK, Aug. 23.â Those fel
lows who are running: away with
the Idea that Fltzsimmons is going?
to put me out with a left shift
blow, solar plexus punch or some
other kind of freak *t>low. and do
the trick right off the reel, are very
much mistaken.

TJKIAH, Aug. 23.â A curious story comes
from Hearst, a small mountain hamlet on
Kel River, in this county. Whatever the
facts may be, it is certain that the prin
cipal man concerned in the Incident lies
'buried beside the highway with' a gaping
wound in his throat. The circumstances
are as follows:
A few weeks ago a man named Thomp
son arrived in the vicinity of Hearst from
Colusa County. Last Sunday Thompson
was at Hearst. There ia a saloon at
Hearst, and on Sunday three- or four men
were there 'drinking and. having a tlmo.
Thompson was with the party for a time,
and it is said that he told one of them
that he was tired of life and asked what
he ought to do. The man told him If he
was tired of life he. had better kill him
self.
Soon after this conversation Thompson
got into a skiff and started -down Eel
River. The story told by the men present
is that Thompson j had proceeded down
stream but a short distance when tho
boat struck a rock. ; Thompson then
Jumped ashore and at once cut his throat.
Some time afterward he was found dead.
The boon companions took his body
back to the saloon, dug a grave near by
and without other ceremony' than what
would be suggested in the minds of a lot
of drunken roisterers buried It then and
there. No report of the death was made
to the Coroner. -That public official Â¦ had
heard nothing of it until The Call corre
spondent informed him this morning. The
man Thompson may have killed himself;
probably he did; but the case evidently
demands Investigation.-

ROW OVER SALE OF
HOLDOVER RAISINS
Packers Complain That They Were
Not Given an Opportunity to
Purchase Them.
9--Â«.r'!>l IMcrat.-h to The Call.
FRESNO. Aug. 23.â x.. ere is a big row
in raisin-packing circles to-night over the
sale of 1 he hold-over raisins as reported
yesterday to three packing firmsâ Griffin
& Skelley Company. The Fresno Homo
Packing Company and the Co-operatives.
Svjme of the other packing firms are
claiming now that they should have been
given a chance to purchase these raisins,
or Â«t loast a portion of them, and they
criticize the o. rectors for entering into
â¢vhat they term a "private bargain."
Just what the complaint of these pack
ers will result in. It is impossible to say
ns yet. but the matter will In all prob-'
ability be brought up belore a meeting of
the Packers' Association for considera
tion. The packers who were not parties
to the transaction were active to-day and
conferences between them were frequent..
One of the directors in speaking of the
matter after being questioned in regard
to the complaint of some of the packers
said the- board contemplated no reconsid
eration of its action, that all the pack
er? knew the association had these raisins
on its hands and was anxious to sell them.
The board, of course, did not advertlsefor
bids nor call the packers together to ask
them for an offer as that was considered
unnecessary, inasmuch as all knew that
the raisins were for sale. The raisins
were hold-over goods, belonged to the as
sociation, and the association had a per
fect right to do with them as it pleased,
he said.

In an assault upon the fanatical Chinese.
The mission of Mr. Divin is a sad one,
by reason of the fact that he comes to
meet the widow of Coir- T.i=cum and to
escort her to her homr Elmira, New
York. Mrs. Liscum was with her hus
band In Manila when the trouble began
in Peking and when Colonel Liscum was
ordered to the new scene of carnage, she
remained in the Philippine capital, ex
pecting that her husband would not be
long absent. The next she heard of him
was the announcement of his death while
In action.
The widowed la.d>" Is returning on the
transport Thomas and is expected to ar
rive on the 2Sth inst. The steamer left
Nagasaki on the 10th inst. It was ex
pected that the remains would be brought
over on the transport, but at the last
moment Secretary of War Root telegraph
ed Mr. Divin that after ; cabling he had
found that this would be impossible, but
that the body would be brought home at
the earliest possible date. In their trans
portation the remains will be given the
highest possible military honors.

Â¦The Rev. Mr. Scott's identity would
not have been established had he,' not
divulged It In '*his;' -maudlin'* moments.
While investigating the tenderloin * he
wore clothes -' that did not Indicate his
sacred calling. <
Excessive drinking had a depressing ef
fect on the minister. His nerves were
shattered and he was soon on the verge
of delirium tremens. His condition
dawned on him -and he visited the ' Re ;
celvlng Hospital for medical aid. He
was given some bromide | to quiet hi3
nerves and left. The following day the
Rev. Mr. Scott returned and asked the
privilege of remaining until he recovered
his scattered senses. He was Informed
that the Receiving Hospital was only for
temporary relief and he was, directed .to
go to the City and County Hospital.
The sufferer wasted no time, but went
there and was placed In ward K, pre
sided- over by . Dr. Hirschfelder. Dr.
Charles O'Connor, an interne, attended
the minister, and- last night the patient
was so far recovered as . to be able to
leave the hospital. During his stay there,
however, it was necessary to strap him
to Ms bed to prevent his doing injury to
himself. -" In his .'delirium. .the "reverend
gentleman discussed : theological subjects.'
According to the -records* the " minister
entered the hospital on August* 13. : He
give his V'; name as William D. Scott,
birthplace, Canada; occupation, clerk, and
his residence Fourth- and Silver streets. â¢
The mystery surrounding the Rev. Mr.
Scott's disappearance having been ex
plained, the police of this c:ty and Salt
L-ake City feel relieved. The minister
left the latter city on June 26 to take
temporary charge of the little church in
Ben Lomond, near Santa Cruz. About
August 10 he ieft that town and came to
this city, on route to Salt Lake. While
here he essayed a, study of the tenderloin
with a view to preaching a sermon on its
wickedness when he returned to his home.
His Intentions were good, but the clink
ing of wine glasses and the smiles of the
lair revelers proved too much for the
clergyman and he fell from grace.
The whereabouts of the Rev. "W. Daunt
Scott, the Salt Lake City clergyman, is
no longer a mystery. During the week
last past he has been an inmate of the
City and County Hospital, suffering from
an overindulgence Jn alcoholic beverages.
As soon as his retiring place became
known to his brethren they called at the
hospital and took him away to a placo
more adapted to one in his station of
life. â¢â¢â¢Â¦â¢,/:

Two Men Implicated.
Several people who were In the neigh
borhood claim to have seen two men run
ning on Clay street. Both started at San
some. but went in cpposlte directions.
This gives rise to the belief that two men
were implicated in the affair, one acting
as a "lookout" for the other. Jackson
describes the man who committed the
crime as about five feet eight inches in
height, wearing a black cerby and suit
and having a heavy dark mustache. He
says he would be able to identify him.
The Injured oftier-r was unable to give any
description of.the.man, and the . two
teamsters say the doorway was so dark
that they did not get an opportunity to
see the shooter's face.

the saloon and passed close by him with
a smoking revolver in his hand. As be

want to get killed, too?" Jackson said the
man turned down Clay street. The col
ored man's story did not completely satis
fy the detectives, and they took him into
custody.-
The two teamsters whom Xichols had
j called to help him rushed awav a^ soon
as the first shot was fired. They went
i into the market and rfmained there for
some time. The policeman watched the
man who had shot him dash into San
! some street and turn the corner of Clay,
running in the direction of the ferries.

OAKLAND, Aug. 23.â "If the Mill
owners' Association sends us an authori
tative answer refusing to give an eight
hour day and declining to arbitrate the
matter we will show it that neither will
the workmen yield nor the builders be
embarrassed. The Building -Trades Coun
cil will start a planing mill of Its own."
This statement was made to-day by J.
H. Mullen, business agent of the Oakland
.Building Trades Council.
"We have the money and the men,"
continued Mr. Mullen, '.'and the intermed
iate profits of the business will do us as
much good' as "the, so-called mill-owners.
If it becomes necessary to act we will put
up the largest mill in Oakland. I don't
think we would have much competition,
for half of the; present mills are on the
verge of bankruptcy. We would be able
to start with a larger capital than any
of them.
"I hope the public will notice that the
Mill-Owners" Association has at last ad
mitted that It objects not to the eight
hour day, but. to the men having anything
to say as to how or when they shall work.
That is thelrfal. issue with the mill
owners. They want to be despots; they
want to rule or ruin."
The locked-out union f men will hold a
meeting to-morrow evening to consider
the advisaballly of starting a co-operative
mill. â¢ .
The owners and operatives have had
several conferences, but a definite agree
ment Is as far off now as It was when
the men; walked out. Representatives of
each faction are firm In their statements
that they will not weaken and back
down.
CO-OPERATIVE
MILL NOW THE v
, PROPOSED PLAN
and went back to work, and a third man
has promised to report for duty to-day.
The fact that all the mills which refused
to accept the eight-hour schedule are now
running is considered an Indication that
the strikers are losing ground.
The meeting of the Building Trades
Council last evening was largely attend
ed, and it was nearly midnight when ad
journment was taken. It was announced
that another Oaklan-1 mill had come over
to the union's ranks. "Our > action to
night," said President McCarthy, "means Â¦
a positive refusal to handle the product
of any nine-hour mill fiom now on. There
has been no actual hoycott u;> to date.
We have simply kept track oC the goods
sent out by 'unfair' mills, but nov,- an at- ;
tempt to construct material from these I
'unfair' shops will result In a;i Immediate
suspension of work by all unljon men em
ployed on the job." j
The following statement was given ou:
by the press committee after the meeting:
A*t"a special meeting of the Building Trades
Council, held on Aucust 19, the suggestion ot
the Builders' Association that the contention
between the mill-owners and the millmen be
suhmittcd to the Merchants' Association for
arbitration van accepted, but since that time
the Mill-owners* Association has refused arbi
tration and contrary to the expressed sentiment
of newspapers, merchants, business men and
the public at large, persists In such course.
The Building Trades Council has done all
that It was possible to do toward an amicable
settlement of the difficulty, and forced by
the unyieldlns attitude of the mill-owners,
is now obliged to take action in accordance,
wlthf the principles involved in the issue. In
taklnz this step it sincerely regrets the effect
which it will have upon the community, and
It steadfastly hoped to avoid any serious com
plications, but after havlnjr resorted to every
other means to reach a settlement of the mat
and It becomes Incumbent upon us to enforce
the eight-hour day, and to that end the Build-
Ing Trades Council, in reRular meeting assem
bled, declares all mills which were notified
six months aco that on August 13 the eight
hour day would be requested and are now
working over eight hours per day to be "un
fair," and hereby refu.'-es to handle, place or
work on any building where said unfair mill
work constitutes a part of the structure.
.Yesterday was a day of gains for the
mill-owners. "W. J. Little, who shut down
his Brannan-street mill on the day the
trouble began, started, up Tuesday with
six men, and yesterday he added two
more to ms force, one of whom is a mem
ber of the union. A second union man
reported to Mr. Little last evening, and
he will be put to work this morning.
At the meeting of the Mill-owners' As
sociation Wednesday evening a commit-,
tee was appointed to meet with the
Builders' Exchange to-morrow afternoon
at 1 o'clock, when the strike' situation is
to be discussed. This will be a special
meeting and will he held at the request
of a number of mill-owners, members of
the Exchange, who are anxious for an
expression of opinion from the organiza
tion. The membership of the Exchange,
between 300 and 400, is made up of all the
dealers who supply building material.
It is stated that the mill-owners have
been assured of the support of many big
corporations throughout the State, which
feel that Jf the employes here be success
ful in their demand for an eight-hour
workday it will only be a question of
time before the employers in other
branches of manufacturing will be called
upon to make similar concessions. It Is
stated that the Union Iron Works Is slat
ed for a change of working hours if the
planing-mill operators prove successful.
The Excelsior Redwood Company, on
Fourth street, which has one of the larg
est plants in the city, is running with a
full quota of help. This mill was running
slack at first, but yesterday Manager
Moore h?.d more applications than he
could handle, and he sent quite a few men
to other mills In the city.
C. \V. Burgess put on two men yester
day, which he says will be sufficient for
several weeks to come. He has been run
ning a machine himself ever since the :
trouble began.
Some of the millmen are wrought up ;
over President McCarthy's statement that
there would be no general strike ordered.
In speaking of the matter yesterday one
of the millmen said: "We did not want
to begin this movement, but were led into
it by the building trades and expected
their support. Two weeks have elapsed
and P. H. McCarthy announces that
there will be no general strike. If. this
bo true the wisest course to pursue Is to
return to work at once."

Wednesday night's meeting
that under no circumstances

NEW YORK, Aug. 23.â Tyler Henehaw
of San Francisco is at the Herald Square;
C. George Krogness, Eastern agent of
The Call, is. at the Imperial.
CALIF0RN1ANS IN NEW YORK.
So far as we know there has been no. such Change
noted in the cycle trade in this country and it is not
likely .that there will be, for the proportion ot Amer
icans who have bought bicycies solely for amusement
has not been so large as that in Great Britain.':' The
cessation of cycling ris a fad would therefore be less
important here- than there. f ; Nevertheless the down
ward^tendency of prices in the old country isworth
noting, for it signifies a new era in : the ', history of the
wheel." Â¦
The falling oft in the demand for fine wheels, as
compared with cheap ones, may be taken as a sign
that in England the wheel has ceased'to be regarded
as an article of luxury and amusement for the rich and
has become a thing of use by workingmen, messen
ger boys, mail-carriers and others who have to do a
good deal of moving about from one place to an
other. That a man is seen riding a wheel is no longer
evidence that he is a "gentleman of leisure," taking a
spin for his amusement. He may be a workingman
going to or from his shop. Consequently the rich
are no : longer so addicted to the wheel as they were.
Society is hunting a new amusement. The cheap, ser
viceable wheel for utility is more in demand "than the
fancy article and the boom in the business has begun
to subside.;
The Birmingham correspondent of the New York
Commercial, in commenting upon the conditions of
the bicycle manufacturing trade in Englandand par
ticularly at Coventry, says: "The demand for
high-grade machines has never before been so small
in proportion to cheap ones; it has not been possible
to turn out the low-priced cycles in such quantities as
is necessary in order to insure decent profits. Firms
assert that they have made more machines this year
than ever before, and yet their financial results are
unsatisfactory. Still, it is safe to assert that, in the
total, as many machines have not been sold in 1900
as. were in 1899. It <s believed to.be.^ fair, estimate
that 10 per cent less bicycles have been â¢ soid in the
first six months of 1900 as against the. corresponding
period a year ago. Since June little or] nothing-: has
been done."
DECLINE OF THE CYCLE.
ONLY a short time ago there was a much talk
ing set of economists who declared that before
the advancing bicycle the horse would have to
retire from the streets and roads and content himself
with hauling the plow or running races. The prophets
were of the class who prophesy without knowing.
The war in South Africa has brought the horse to the
front as prominently as'ever, while it appears that, in
the British islands at any rate, the cycle trade is in a
bad way and the use of the wneel is declining.
VOTE for honest politics and down the bosses.
That is the counsel The Call has to give to all
Republicans in San Francisco. In the party pri
maries to-day the issue between genuine Republican
ism and boss rule is clearly drawn. No one can mis
t?.ke it. A vote for the regular ticket is a vote against
the bosses. A vote for the Herrin, Crimmins and
Kelly ticket is a vote against the Republican party.
With the situation every one who has followed the
proceedings leading up to the primaries is familiar.
The Call has kept the public posted on every move
j made by the honest members of the County Com
j mittee or by the tools of the bosses. It is familiar to
! all that Herrin and his crowd made use of every
j means in their power to dominate the committee so
j that they could run the primaries to suit themselves.
i In that attempt they were beaten. Honest politics
! triumphed. The rank and file of the party have been
I assured fair primaries. Every vote honestly cast will
1 be honestly counted. So far, then, as the arrangements
j for the primaries are concerned the bosses have been
i beaten. Now comes the task of defeating them at the
j polls. The stalwart Republicans who control the
I County Committee have done^ all that is in their
j power. The rest is with the rank and file. The issue
I is up to them and they must meet it to-day.
j JThc points of chief danger are the Forty-first As
j sembly District, where Dibble is seeking a nomination
j to the Assembly, and the Thirty-seventh and Thirty
eighth Assembly districts, which make up the Twenty
first Senatorial District, in which E. I. Wolfe is
seeking a nomination. That precious pair of notori
ous misrepresentatives of the party, the people and
the city are the special pets of the bosses and every
trick and fraud known to the politics of the Mint
Saloon and the Southern Pacific law office will be
resorted to for the purposes of procuring nominations
for them. In those districts, therefore, not a single de
cent Republican should remain a\Hy from the polls.
Every vote will be needed.
One of the tricks which Dibble has devised to help
him in the Forty-first has been exposed by The Call.
It consists in nominating on his ticket for the State
convention such well known Republicans as Judge
Van Fleet of the Republican National Committee
and George Stone, Wakefield. Baker and J. B. Dutton
of the State Central Committee. By putting those
gentlemen on his ticket for the State convention the
, astute schemer, hopes to induce a good many decent
Republicans to vote for his candidates for the. local
convention. That trick having been exposed may
now', be comparatively harmless, but other tricks will
doubtless be put forth from the same source "to-day.
Look out for them.
There should be no question in the minds of any
FOR HONEST POLITICS.
THE Aneall Italian Opera Company
will open up a grand opera season at
the California Theater on September
S. . Maurice Grau will commence a
grand opera season at the Grand
Opera-house in the beginning of Xovem
ber. Assuming that the Tlvoli manage
ment will repeat its last year's eighteen
weeks' run of grand opera and that the
Azzali Company contemplates even an
eight weeks' season, we shall have the ab
solutely unique spectacle of three gTand
opera, companies giving performances at
the same time in this city. Nay, fur
ther. If it should please Mr. Graff, who
will bring out the Sembrich-Dippel-Ben
saude-Bevignani combination on some
yet unannounced date during the winter,
to come in at the season's beginning, San
Francisco might proudly ask in vain for
any city in the United States to duplicate
the musical conditions then existent here.
Curiously enough, the. Azzali company
promises more in the way of novelty than
any of the rest, Grau's repertoire, in par
ticular, being famously antique. "Fal
stafi," one of the Tivoli's promised novel
ties, will be griven by Azzali and the
worshipers of Salassa will bemuch inter

zali) rival in this, one of his most famous
roles.
Massenet's "Manon Lescaut" will be

The world may !ong wait for the sure retribution
that will follow the tactics of Roberts and Kitchener,
but the shadow of jud.q^nent always overtakes a peop!e
who sanction such things, and the people of England
owe it to themselves to purge their hearts of the
spirit which permits stich deeds to be done in their
jiames.
It is not fair war thst Roberts is making in South
Africa. It is an attempt to compel the surrender of
combatants by abuse of non-combatants, which is not
recognized by nations nor by soldiers as within the
This has proved to be the case. England is paying
for it now in blood and treasure. Stout old Kruger
warns his men that surrender does not mean home,
but St. Helena, and every shaggy soldier girds him
and fights on. Lor-i Roberts is trying to end the
wsr by burning farmsteads over the heads of the
women and children and the aged, too decrepit to
fight. But the shelteiless women gather their young
i-b^ui them and go out upon the cheerless veldt, only
to ask of their men under arms to fight on.
We believed at the time that instead of shortening
the struggle of the Boers by terrifying them, sending
Cronie to a hated island prison to die would intensify
the struggle.

"Woe to the conquered," as they rattled by in chains
in the triumph of the conqueror, never manifested a
r:<ire brutal spirit than was shown toward Cronje and
his; faithful wife.
The brave old Boer v.as shown scant courtesy by
his focmen and correspondents of the London press
tickled the fancy of their readers by humorous de
scriptions of the dress and toilet of Madame Cronje,
a brave r.nd high-hearted woman, who had endured
the terrors of the march and the horrors of the be
sieged camp by the side of her husband. Had her
critics been men, remembering their mothers, they
vould not have pretended to expect her emergence
from such a scene dressed for a social function, but
would have respected her gray hairs and raiment,
even' rag of which was ennobled by devotion to her
husband and his cause.
HOME AND ST. HELENA.
WH EX brave Cronje was sent to St. Helena, to
punish him for a defense that suffers nothing
by comparison with the greatest actions in war,
eve deprecated the startling exhibition of England's
malice and spiteful spirit. Outnumbered in men and
guns by more than ten to one, he fought until thirst,
starvation and exhausted ammunition compelled him
to capitulate. Lord Roberts' vainglorious dispatch.

PERSONAL MENTION.
AGUINALDO-What a Lot of Fake Imitators.
. ' â¢ . â¢ âPioneer Press.
We are now engaged in another Presidential cam
paign and once more the Republican party appears
as the champion of American shipping. It is there
fore timely to recall the importance of the issue to the
minds of the constituents. No man should be elected
to Congress who is not willing to pledge himself to
erzet legislation which will give American ships, built
â¢in American shipyards, manned by American seameV:
and flying the American flag such a degree of pro
tection as will place them on an equality with the
bounty-supported ships of foreign nations; and there
by enable them to carry over the ocean the commerce
of our. country.
The failure to pass the merchant marine bill at the
last session of Congress constitutes the one defect
in the otherwise flawless fulfillment of the Republican
campaign pledges of 1896. The party promised in
that campaign to establish the finances of the nation
on a sound basis, to reform the currency and banking
laws, to establish a comprehensive system of protec
tion for all American industries and to promote the
shipping interests of the nation. All have been ful
filled except the last. By one means or another the
opponents of American shipping have managed to
defeat its hopes even in the house of its friends.
We have protected our coastwise commerce until the
tonnage enrolled In It is greater than the coasting ton
nage of any other nation. We have promoted the build
ing of railroads by cash loans and land subsidies from
Congress, by State and municipal subventions of various
kinds and degrees, but aggregating great values, and
have thus accomplished an internal industrial and com
mercial development unequaled in any age of the historic
world. We have protected our industries, with the result
that manufactures, which in 18S0 were less in value than
agriculture, had, in 1S90, passed it with such leaps and
bounds as to represent 52 per cent of the total value of
all the industries of the United States, while agriculture
was but 2S per cent. From that pleasing picture one.
cannot but turn with disappointment and chagrin to this
one, that between 1S70 and 1S99 the proportion of foreign
commerce carried in American vessels fell from 33, per
cent to 8.9 per centâ to less than half what it was in" the
first year of our national existence (17S9). Disagreeable
as this result, is, an examination into the historic pro
cesses by which it has been accomplished will serve only
to make it more displeasing, even to humiliating 1 our
national pride.
Referring to the way in which our merchant marine
has been treated, as compared with the treatment ac
corded to other great interests of the nation, Mr.
Stubbs said:
By way of texts for his speech Mr. Stubbs quoted
the saying of Secretary Gage, "The only dark spot
upon this record of the nation's progress is our failure
in the carrying trade upon the high seas," and this
f-om the Statesman's Year Book, "The foreign com
merce of the United States is at present largely carried
on in foreign bottoms." Upon those statements the
argument of the speaker was built up and a striking
and impressive appeal made for justice to our shipping
interests.
VICE PRESIDENT STUBBS of the Southern
Pacific Company made a happy choice in select
ing our merchant marine as the subject of his
address at the banquet given him in Chicago by the
National Association of Merchants. There is hardly
any feature of our commercial life that merits more
consideration at this time. Our foreign trade has ex
panded and augmented to an extent that is one of
the marvels of the age, but our ocean shipping lags
behind that of nations far inferior to our own in every
other respect.

The Chinese situation is evidently "just entering
upon its critical stage, snd whatever may be the result,
President McKinley deserves the greatest praise and
the most unwavering support for the creditable part
he has taken from the beginning until now.
Already it is reported that Russia has mobilized an
army of 375.000 men to march upon China; Germany
is moving in the same direction, and if all these troops
land there must be something for them to do to jus
tify their home governments in sending them.
The world does not need the spectacle of famine,
anarchy afid tragedy in China, which will follow the
paralysis or disappearance of an ancient polity. Those
who desire that the Chinese gradually assimilate such
modern ideas as will aid their industrial progress will
be easiest and soonest gratified if the advice of the
President is heeded and his intentions are at once met
half way by the Chinese Government.
It is the opinion of Japan that the Empress Dow
ager is the force to be reckoned with in China. As
long as that remarkable woman lives she will hold
primacy in Chinese affairs. Even if the Emperor is
restored to his temporalities he will be the instru
ment of her will. Whether she is dealt with primarily,
or secondarily through the Emperor, she is the one
power in that land with authority to plr.cate the people
and vitalize President McKinley's policy. She may
act through some one of the great bureaus which
manage the complicated government of half a billion
people: but, whatever the medium chosen, her ad
visers must make her understand that the integrity of
China and her dynastic interests can be preserved only
ir. the way pointed out by the President of the United
States.
The President has secured for this country a novel
position, but it is as necessary as it is no\^l.
NOT only Americans,' but students of affairs,
â¢ everywhere, will heartily 'applaud the repeated
determination of President McKinley to medi
ate for peace in China, to the end that partition of
that empire may be prevented. The responsibility
rests upon China to restore the public authority of its
Government, arrange proper reparation to the powers
and submit such guarantees as will terminate at once
the occupation of her territory by foreign troops.
We believe there is no substantial difference of
opinion here either as to the wisdom and general hu
manity of this position or as to its being in harmony
with American interests.. These interests, also, are in
line with the legitimate interests of the other nations
concerned. They are in harmony with the commer
cial equality, for which the open door negotiations
were made and concluded by our Government. Those
negotiations, carried en several months in advance of
the beginning of the present troubles, are now in evi
dence to prove the wise foresight of President Mc-
Kinley and Secretary Hay. The agreement by which
they were successfully concluded is a binding inter
rational compact which none of the nations party to
them can violate without offense to this country. If
they had only China to deal with the case would be
different. Then each would be intent only on grab
bing as many square miles of territory and. getting
jurisdiction of as many millions of people as possible,
that they might monopolize the resulting commerca.
It is easy to see that this would mean the bitterest
wrangle among themselves, leading surely to war on
Chinese soil between the European powers now
represented there by armed forces. Being bound by
an agreement for commercial equality, a large part of
the temptation to independent action and seizure of
territory is destroyed, since they would be spending
much to get nothing beyond what would belong
equally to the nations that spent nothing.
It need not be expected that all of the nations which
find their hands tied by the President's open door
compact will be patient under it. They feel that they
were outwitted by his superior foresight. If therefore
their armies can remain on Chinese soil indefinitely,
under the pretense of maintaining order and perform
ing the necessary civil functions abandoned by the
Chinese Government, they can accumulate reasons for
taking territory by piling up a volume of money in
demnity that China cannot meet.
There are Chinese statesmen and they should com
prehend clearly the scope and purpose of President
McKinley's policy. They should respond to it at
once frankly and fairly. They may expect Europe to
impose difficulties in the way of such response, but
with joint action between the United States, Japan
and England, such subterfuges will not avail.
THE PRESIDENT AND CHINfl.
Let each Republican remember that this election is
the crisis of the campaign. Should the bosses triumph
the party convention will be dominated by them and
the candidates whom it nominates will enter the con
test more or less discredited by that fact. Those who
desire to see Republicans elected in November should
go to the primaries and vote the true Republican*
ticket so that the party may nominate candidates
worthy of election. The issue cannot be avoided. It
must be determined to-day. Vote early. Get your
friends to vote. Help to bring out the full strength
of decent Republicanism. Let us sweep Herrin,
Crimmins and Kelly and all their tools of the type of
Dibble and Wolfe out of the Republican party of San
Francisco.

ticket for- each district was published in ,The Call

In his lecture he explained the attitude
of the church toward free thinkers as one
of unalterable opposition. He held that
the system of free thought led to skepti

for the benefit of the building fund of St.

oratory nnd song and the noise of parlor
rifles. The orator was Frank Shea; the
architect, who paid tribute due to the
earnest and effective work of Rev. Father

and pointed out effectively the needs of
the parish, which hopes to have a hand

will also be open in the afternoon for the

There has been a mistaken impression
concerning the church property of St.

realty that tho parish has title to is that
where the parochial residence stands and
thn vacant "lot set aside for the church to
be erected. The St. Mary's College prop
erty belongs to the diocese. This under
standing of the facts will lead the liberal

Convinced that the woman was a burg
lar Mrs. Coyne bravely seized her ana
lustily shouted for help. While the two
women were struggling the female crook
dropped a bunch of skeleton keys from
under the folds of her wrap. At Uiis
juncture a man, who was a stranger to
Mrs. Coyne, approached Mrs. Coyne and
asked if she needed help. Mrs. Coyne re
plied that the woman was a burglar and
begged him to hold her until she could
return to her own fiat and telephone for
the police. The strange man willingly
consented, and taking the woman by the
arm told her she would have to remain
until a police officer arrived.
While Mrs. Coyne was telephoning to
the sergeant at the O'Farrell-street sta
tion the man and the woman ! hurried
along Steiner street and soon disappeared.
A few minutes later two police officers
arrived, but after an exhaustive searcn
of the neighborhood they were unable lo
obtain a trace of the pair. The skeleton
keys were turned over to the police and
proved to be of unusually fine workman

Chief Sullivan is satisfied that the man
was a pal of the woman.
Mrs. Mayers returned a short time after
ward and was surprised to find that the
house had been entered during her ab

ers and his family went to the country
to spend their vacation. Fearing a second
visit from the mysterious burglar ivlr.
Mayers asked a Mrs. Coyne, who lives in
the upper flat, to keep a watch on the
house. While Mrs. Coyne was doing some
sewing a few days after the Mayers had
left the city, she was suddenly startled by
a peculiar noise in the flat occupied by
the Mayers. She hurried downstairs to
find a woman in black leaving the flat.
Her latest victim Is C. Mayers, who has
charge of the Jewelry department of the
Emporium and who lives at Fell and
Steiner streets. On two occasions has
the female burglar entered his house and
carried away valuable booty. On her first
visit she â¢ opened the front door with a
skeleton key while Mrs. Mayers was
downtown purchasing provisions. . After
thoroughly searching the house she left
by the rear entrance without being seen.
The police are anxiously searching for
a woman burglar who has been operating
with considerable success in various parts
of the city. She is generally dressed in

a product of our country. It is true that â¢
Sir Robert Walpole before the middle of |
the last century organized party govern
ment in England, hut the machinery of
parties was very crude 1W years ago. In
our own country we have constructed
since 1S00 the most perfect system of |
party organization, in theory, which ex
ists In the world. Our plan of erecting a
series of nominating conventions and ex- !
ecutive committees on a. basis of party
primaries is unimpeachable in principle,
and this elaborate system la a typical de- Â¦
velopment of this century.
Political Parties and the Civil Service j
In the evolution of party machinery to !
operate free government every country [
passes through an era when the spoils
system runs riot. The early English par
ties inherited the spoils system from the
regime of personal monarchy, which the
party system displaced. The King was ,
often moved by other considerations than i
those of fitness in bestowing office, and It I
was not unnatural that when political par
ties took the appointing power from the
monarch they should follow the royal ex
ample in bestowing patronage. In Amer
ica the spoils system crept into the poll
tics'of some of the States, notably New
York very early in our history, but It dltl
not invade the Federal system until the
time of Jackson. -
Like other evil?, the spoils system pro
vokes reaction by excess. In England a
democracy of growing Intelligence de
manded the merit system about the
middle of the century, and In America a
generation later an outraged people began
to move on the spoilsmen. Great Britain
has completely purged her civil service j
of the taint of spoils: we have made an j
excellent beginning in this country. The
victories of civil service reform in these
and other countries must surely be reck
oned among the most important govern
mental achievements" of our century.
Ballot v . Reform.
Another political product of our era la
the secret ballot system. From one point
of view this may seem too trivial to cite
in this rapid review of political develop
ment, but since free and fair elections are
the only sure foundation of popular gov
ernment the introduction of a plan which
guarantees such elections must be regard
ed as one of the notable political events
of our time. â .
Some Radical Proposals.
Two important and far-reaching modi
fications of political practice have been
eagerly discussed during the closing years
of our century, but they have received
practical application only on a very small
scale. These are the initiative and refer
endum and proportional representation.
The system of initiative and referendum,
which represents the closest possible ap
proach to pure democracy, has been suc
cessfully applied In Switzerland for many
years and has been used to a very slight
extent In local government elsewhere.

which aims to secure accurate reflection

was stored on a shelf when he lost hu
hold and fell, striking the sharp edge ot

Emergency Hospital. His leg was badly
cut and he received serious internal In
juries.
Party Machinery.
In the applicatian of the theory of dem
ocratic government which has character
ized the period under review the organiza
tion of political parties has been the chief
factor. The party machine, with all Its
notable virtues and Its manifold vices, is
(Concluded.)
Modern Monarchies.
The century has witnessed the birth of
two great powers of Europe through a
process of unification of unimportant
States which had hitherto been bound to
gether by ties of blood and common racial
traditions. These are Germany and Italy.
Until our century a German nation was
simply a dream of patriots of common lan-'
gunge and instincts. But through the
genius of Stein and Bismarck the dream
has materialized In a great federal mon- I
archy, with an Emperor whose large pre
rogative is overshadowed by the supreme
will of the people as expressed in Parlia
ment.
Meantime the states of the Italian pen
insula have been welded together by Vic
tor Emmanuel, by Count etivour and by j
Garibaldi, and another monarchy' of the
modern type has taken its place among j
the great powers. In these monarchies j
and in all others of Europe save the
mighty Btate of half-civilized Russia the
spirit of the century has inspired the peo
ple to demand and to exact by revolution
if necessary a liberal measure of self
government through a representative Par
liament.
a community, has just been adopted In
Belgium and Is in operation in a small
way in a few other places. But the gen
eral realization of these newer plans for
the Improvement of democracy must fis
ure as one of the pojltical achievements
of the twentieth century. The nineteenth
can claim only the conception of the Ideas
and the discussion of the ideals.
The Municipal Problem.
The briefest review of tho century wbuM
bo woefully incomplete if It did not men
tion the new and puzzling element which,
has been injected into the governmental
problem by the- recent marvelous growth
of great cities. The statistics of the re
markable growth of city population have
been quoted so often that it la not neces
sary to cite them here. The facts are*
familiar to all. Many of the problems pre
sented by the government of these great
masses of densely crowded city dwellÂ«rs
are as yet unsolved even In theory. We
are still experimenting with the organiza
tion of city government, and we have ar
rived at no agreement regarding the scope
of the duties which the city should per
form. The tendency at present la totvarrt
a wider and wider field of municipal ac
tivity.
Growing Importance of Government.
And this Introduces us to the final con
sideration in this review â the development
of the functions of government during tho
last 100 years. As we survey the* govern
mental field from this point of view we
note that our century, especially the lat
ter half, has been marked by a rapid in
crease of the duties undertaken by public
authorities. In 1800 the duties of govern
ment were comparatively few and simple.
It was expected to do little except protect
life and property. Bat as the modern in
dustrial system developed It became evi
dent that the scope of public authority
would have to be extended to the regu
lation of industry in the interest of the
weaker classes. The factory acts of
England furnish an excellent illustration
of this extension of function. Gradually
this interference with what formerly was
purely private- business has increased.
Governments have undertaken Industrial
enterprises, such as railroads, telegraphs
and telephones. At the same time public
supervision of private business has been
.extended in many directions. The recent
growth of great combinations has given
Impetus to this movement, for the peonlo
have become alarmed at the possibilities
of abuse of the tremendous power wield
ed by corporation managers, and have ap
pealed to the Government for protection
through public regulation.
Meantime the growth of great cities has
made new demands for the extension of
public activity within the municipality.
The distinctively monopolistic services.
i such as street railways and lighting:
plants, are now operated by many cities,
and even where the operation is In pri
vate hands the municipality exercises
i strict control in all intelligent communl
i ties. Moreover, municipal authorities are
i now assuming responsibility for the prop
1 er bousing of the poorer citizens, for the
i care of their health and for the provision
i of recreation. Thus both the general and
| the local governments have occupied
' fields of usefulness far wider than those
I of 100 years ago and. the process of ex
! tension is still polng on with apparently
I Increasing rapidity.
New Responsibilities of Democracy.
It is apparent, then, at the close of the
century that the social forces are eon
j spiring to make government more and
I more vital to the citizen. Thus the re
sponsibilities of democracy, which have
! already increased so greatly, are becom
] ins heavier each year. But a review of
i the history of the last hundred years af
i fords ground for a rational confidence
that these responsibilities will be squarely
! met and successfully discharged. There
â¢ has been much diacusslon lately of tha
I weaknesses of democracy and Its possl-
J h!e failure to respond to the increased de
mands upon itB intelligence which the
more complicated governmental system
of our day is making. Especially In
[ America thf-ro is much pessimistic com-
I parison of the depravity of the present
I with the simple virtues of the past. Tha
| s-tatesmen of the early days of the re-
I public viewed through the haze of dls
| tance are transfigured and the men who
chose these paragons to administer their
Government share by reflection tne glory
of their leaders. B;_t the historian who
is under no illusions writes most vtvid
fssays on the political depravity of the
fathers. It is, unhappily, true that It la
not necessary to search very long In the
political rystera of even the most en
lightened nations of our day to discover
glaring defects. But a careful and candid
examination of the politics of our fore
fathers reveals shortcomings and positive
evils of so much more serious nature
j than those we wrestle with that the ob
j server becomes very hopeful for the fu
ture as he marks the progress of the past.

THE CALL'S
HOME STUDY CIRCLE
Six. white men and one "coon" were cap
tured yesterday in the building out of
which "the Harbor Commissioners "some
day" hope to make a room for the re
porters of the daily papers. The hobos
got in through a broken window and made
a home in the attic. Three of the men
had sums ranging from $15 to ?20 on them
when searched at the Harbor police sta
tion.
The fishermen made another catch of a
lat-talled shark yesterday. 'The fish is
12Vi feet long, but the body only measures
about four feet, while the tail takes up the
remainder of the measurement. Joe Bar
low captured the fish, and he tells a blood
curdling but impossible story of the evtnt.
Water Front Notes.
The bark Merom of the Alaska Packers'
Association licet is a mnst unfortunate
vessel. Stanchly built and well found,
she yet perms to play In hard luck all the
time. Some years ago sue left here in
charge of a captain who said he knew the
Alaskan coast. After months spent In
searching for his port of entry he came
back to San Francisco, acknowledging
that he had got lost in Bering Sea. Alter
that the Merom met with h number of
mishaps, but she was purchased by the
Alaska Packers' Association and has
proved herself a valuable vessel.
On this last occasion, however, her usual
ill luck returned. While making port in
Bristol Bay she ran on a sandbar and
sprang a leak. She came back to San
Francisco In ballast and yesterday went
on to the drydock. Then it was found
that not a timber had been started, but
that the vessel had run forward on her
anchor and when hard and fast on the
bar had settled down on the anchor that
had been let go to chock her. The fluke
of the anchor pierced her quarter and the
unusual pressure broke It off. It was this
large piece of iron piercing her side that
made thn Merom leak an inch an hour
and caused her return to San Francisco.
Troubles of the Mercm.
The Harbor Commissioners held a spe
cial session yesterday to consider the
question of wharf room for Uncle Sam's,
transports. Among those present were:
Commissioners Kilburn, Harney and Her
old, E. R. Dimond and A. Chesebrough,
representing the firm of Williams, Dimond
& Co., and Colonel Long, U. S. A., and
Captain Barneson, representing the army
transport service.
The question before the board was the
growing necessities of the army transport
service and the need of more dock room.
Colonel Long Bald it was impossible to
carry on the service as things were at

from one end of the front to me other and
It made- the work of loading them very
"he question of assigning the Govern
ment the new Howard-street AY harf No. 3.
now nearlng completion, came up. Cora,
mlssioner Herola pointed out that the
structure was only 453 feet long and that
many of the transports would overlap it
by manv feet. Mr. Chesebrough explained
tne position of Williams, Dimond &. Co.
in the matter. While the nrm has re
ceived no direct promise trom the Com
missioners that the American-Hawaiian
Steamship Company would have the use
of Howard 3, still they had based their
calculations on getting the use of tne
"Nevertheless," said Mr. Chesebrough.
"recognizing the fact that the transport
service has been a good thing for San
Francisco, we are willing to lorego our
mythical claim to the wharf and taKe our
, chances elsewhere."
The posslUlities of Harrison street and
Steuart street wharves were then sug
gested. Colonel Ixmg and Captain Bar
neson did not want the Harrison-street
wharf, even though the fact was ad
vanced that a shed was to be built over
it. Then Steuart street was consicieiecl,
and the chances are that the Government
will find its supplemental accommodation.
Colonel Long had to leavo the meeting
during the atternoon, so Captain Barne
son served as his representative. He.
Commissioner Herold. Chief Kngineer
I Holmes and Chief Wharflnger Henderson
| visited Steuart-street wharf, and the gen
eral opinion was that it could be made
into an ideal transport wharf. The prop
osition is to extend it 300 feet and Duild a
shed over the entire length. The Govern*
ment wants warehouses and a number of
people who own land in the vicinity ot
Spear and Steuart streets are willing to
! erect buildings, so that the chances for
the selection of Steuart street as a second
Government wharf seem to be good.

Little. The lire started in a kettle of tar
and quickly spread to the shed. But for
its prompt discovery a bad fire might
have resulted, as all the buildings in the
neighborhood are of an Inflammable ma.
terial. The cause of the fire is a mys

kettle for several days. The kettle had
been placed close 'to the shed, so that the
flames set fire to it immediately.

And i!ght dressings of CUTICURA, purest of
emollient skin cures. This treatment at once
stops failing hair, removes crusts, scales, and
dandruff, soothes irritated, itching surfaces,
stimulates the hair follicles, supplies the roots
with energy and nourishment, and makes the
hair grow upon a sweet, wholesome, healthy
scalp when all else fails.
Millions of Women
Use Cctccura. Soap exclusively for preserving, purifying, and beautifying
the 6kln, for cleansing the scalp of crusts, scales, and dandruff, and the stop-
ping of falling hair, for softening, whitening, and healing, red, rough, and
sore hands, In the form of baths for annoying irritations and chaftngs, or
too free or offensive perspiration, in the form of washes for ulceralive weak-
nesses, and for many antiseptic purposes which readily suggest themselves
to women, and especially mothers, and for all the purposes of the toilet,
\ bath, and nursery. No amount of persuasion can induce those who have once
osedittou&e any other, especially for preserving and purifying the skin,
scalp, and hair of infants and children. Cuticcra Soap combines delicate
emollient properties derived from Ccticcra, the great skin cure, with the
purest of cleansing Ingredients, and the most refreshing of flower odors. No
other medicated soap ever compounded is to be compared with it for pre-
serving, purifying, and beautifying the pkin, scalp, hair, and hands. No
other foreign or domestic toilet soap, however expensive, is to be compared
with It for all the purposes of the toilet, bath, and nur3ery. Thus it com-
bines, In One Soap at Oke Price, viz., Twexty-five Cents, the best
6kin and complexion soap, the best toilet and best baby soap in the world.
All that has boen said of CtmccaA Soap may be said with even greater emphasis
of ConccaA Ointment, the most delicate, and yet most effective of emollients, and
greatest of skin cures. Its use in connection with Cuticitba Soap (as per directions
arooad each package), in the "Onb Night Coke for Sobk Haxds," in tho
" Ijtstast Relief Treatment fob DisnouaiNQ Itchings and Irritations,"
and in many uses too numerous to mention, is sufficient to prove its superiority
over all other preparations for the skin.

CHICAGO. Aug. 2S.â September wheat opened
a shade up at 73%(373*ic. Liverpool showed a
%Â®%d advance. Heavy rains In the Northwest
were reported as Interfering with harvesting
and the traders generally expected a falling oft
in primary receipts in the near future. In the
face of this the opening figures were a disap
pointment. The cause of this unresponsive at
titude of the market was to be found in sell-
Ing by outside people through, commission
houses. In disgust local traders followed the
outside lead and September dropped early to
73Vic. Later the pressure of an export demand
began to be felt. This started the market up
ward and early sellers turned buyers, but
found offers very' scarce. September rallied
sharply to 74%c and closed strong HSXc higher
at 7i**<ff74Â»<.c.
Improvement In the weather, as viewed from
the standpoint of corn raisers, caused consid
erable liquidation In that cereal. September
closed HÂ®14c down at 39H<?33Hc.
Oats were again under the depressing Influ
ence of September liquidation. September
clr.sed Vig^ic lower at 21*i i '321Â¥ L c.
Provisions were dull early, ' but later some
activity was stirred up by a cash demand,
particularly for lard and ribs. This, in view
of the scarcity of cured meats, caused a
stronger feeling In the pit. September pork
closed 7Hc higher, lard 2Hc better and ribs 6c
improved.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEAT â Liverpool futures were firmer.
Paris futures opened higher and closed lower.
Chicago was higher, with Indications of a
further advance. The leaders bought heavily,
and this, with talk of TO loads for export, hard
ened the market. Sales Wednesday In all po
sitions, for export and otherwise, amounted to
nearly 2,000,000 bushels. Operators -were of the
opinion that the market had at last arrived.
Rains in the northwest continued. Receipts
decreased. Cotton dragged on better weather
and a poor demand.
Local futures opened lower and closed higher,
with more activity. Snot quotations also ad
vanced under a good shipping demand, and the
tone was healthy all around.

In view of the high figures asked, several hun- !
dred barrels at least changing hands around i

e!so in seedless Muscatel raisins at 6^c. Apri
cots were very strong, but no transactions of
imj'OrtariCe were reported.

parently to rumors of sales at low figures â¢

OMAHA, Neb., Aug. 23.â Edwin E.
Balch. assistant cashier of the Omaha
National Bank, was assaulted in his
berth on the Northwestern road, near
ISoone, Iowa, early this morning and
robbed of $130.
On the arrival of the train in this city
he was removed to his home and a phy
sician summoned. While serious, his in
juries are not dangerous. Mr. and Mrs.
Amoretti of this city were also plundered
by the robbers to the extent of a small
sum. They were not awakened by the
robbers. The affair is a mysterious one,
as every one in the car was asleep at the
time, and there is no clew as to who the
perpetrator of. the robbery is.
Balch is now recovering consciousness
and when able to talk may shed some
light upon the affair. It is supposed he
was awakened by the robber and knocked
insensible to prevent an outcry.
Mr. Balch had a hemorrhage after ar
riving In the city, but It is believed he
will recover.' â¢
The theory of the railway people Is that
the robber spotted him in Chicago, where
he was calling upon bankers yesterday,
and that the robber rode in the chair car
until reaching a sjnall station in .Western
Iowa, when Tie. entered the sleeping car
and attacked Mr. Balch.
Hon. W. A. Paxton, one of the leading
capitalists of this city, was robbed some
time during last-.night while sleeping in
his berth on the Illinois Central. , The
thief secured 1150 in money, some valu
able papers and a. number of railroad
passes. Â¦ : - Â¦Â¦ j

The statement published in one of the
papers yesterday, wherein. William Metz
ner was classed as a Kelly-Crimmins man
caused a deal of comment. In the County
Committee Mr. Metzner is an open and
avowed opponent of the bosses.
The Greek-American Republican Club
Greek Republicans Meet.
REPTTBUCAIC county committee
men who take orders from Martir
Kelly and Phil Crimmins confess
defeat in advance of the battle.
I-ast night they assembled at Shiels Hail
and decided to resort to Irregularity; in
timidation ajid fraud. They resolved to
ignore the requirements of the State Cen
tral Committee and the plan of primary
el<-ction officially adopted by the Repub
lican County Committee. They command
ed in effect, by resolution, that election
returns should be sent to Shiels Hall to
be canvassed by Martin Kelly. The pre
cincte wherein the boeses have control of
the election boards will probably obey the
order of the boss. It is needless to say
that the chairman and secretary of the
Republican County Committee will insist
that the provisions of the official call
FhaJI be respected and that returns sent
to a plaee other than the headquarters of
the County Committee will not be con
sidered.
The bosses have an idea that so much
confusion and demoralization will be pro- i
duced that the State Committee may be
persuaded to intervene and a?k that the j
bosses be given by compromise a recog- 1
nition which they could not win in a t'aar
primary election.
The desperate followers of the chagrined
and dethroned bosses threaten to smasn I
taJiot boxes and create havoc generally; 1
but the straight stalwart ami-boss Re
publicans are prepared to maintain their j
rights. The delegates fairly ar.d honestly !
elected trill receive credentials from the
properly constitute-d authority. The de
cent Republicans of San Francisco will
obey the law and obeerve to the letter th-.?
conditions ret forth by the governing '

ballot boxe? ar.d admission cards for their
representatives from the County Comnut
tee. After such acceptance they resolved
to recognize only the cards of a/iruissiun
to the polling places which the, bosses in
each district saw fit to indorse. The
bosses may go a step further and estab
lish polling places of their own in two or
three districts. Yesterday a committee
man of the Thirty-first District obtained
possession of two ballot boxes" without
authority of the district committee.
The call for the meeting at Shiels Hall
Â¦was quietly circulated by the bosses yes
terday afternoon.
The meeting was held in Western Hall
in the Shiels building, 22 O'Farreil street,
in response to a call issued by the chair
man of the county commiuecmen of sev
eral of the Kelly-Crimmins Assembly dis
tricts. Forty were present; all told. Sev
eral showed their lack of interest by leav
ing b^rore the meeting had progressed
far. and at least three of the committee
men present were not in sympathy with
the purposes of the mooting. The resolu
tions snd motions that wÂ«.re adopted re
ceived only half-hearted support, not more
than a dozen voices, being heard when
they were put to a vote.
Augustus Tilden. who was chairman of
the rump conference of ihe County Cen
tral Committee held Tuesday night, called
the meeting to order, and he was chosen
to preside during the evening. George L.
fciii-.rp was chosen as secretary.
Iveoti Samuels made a iong-winded
tpeech in condemnation of Chairman Hou- |
vier's appointment of the returning board *
and the g*cr.ei-ai management of party af- '
fairs by the anti-bess element. He con
cluded by moving that "the respective As
sembly District organizations of county
committeemen recognize no cards of ad
mission to the polling places at the pri
mary except those signed by the chair
man and secretary of the district commit
tee; that the district eoir.mittees meet in
this hall to-morrow nigM to receive re
turns; that they act upon them as a re
turning board: that the ballots be depos
ited with this bodyâ"
Samuels was interrupted here in the
statement of his complex motion by Dr.
R. C. Myer, and a hall" huur was spent by
these two in an argument over the only
truly legal manner to do an illegal and
irregular thing.
"It is to be desired." said Dr. Myer.
"that we proceed along lines absolutely
legr.!. This meeting has not been called
in such a manner as to make possible the
action proposed by Mr. Samuels. By the
call for the primary this meeting, called
as it was, can be only a conference, and
a motion cannot be pa?sed that would be
binding-. Let us not throw away our op
portunity and our work by taking a pai
paf'ly illegal course.
"I have a plan to offer as a substitute.
Ij^x the district committees elect repre
sentatives who shitil constitute a return
ing board. It can meet here and cam ass
ihe returns legally."
Samuels Interposed thp- obieotion to Dr.
Myer's plan that the district committeees
had no power to appoint a returning
board. They themselves, h: contended,
Â¦were the only bodies authorized to can
vops the returns. He admitted that the

Committee and Send

notion of the rump meeting could have no
i-inding effect on the district committees,
but said it would be advisory in nature,
serving to guide the district committees
to act in concert.
As- a result of the discussion Samuel3
moved that it be the sense of the meet
in,? that "the Assembly District commit
tees meet in Charity Hall of this building
to-morrow (Friday) evening at 7. o'clock
each committee to act as a returning
board for the returns from its district."
"From Umo immemorial," T. H. Mc-
Carthy of the Thirty-ninth District said,
"the chairman of the County Central
Committee has made a report of the re
sults of the primary to the State Central
Committee. Mr. Bouvier will do so in thl3
case of returns made as specified in tho
call. I submit that any gentleman having
a grievance can secure redress at the
hands of the State Central Committee.
Why should we undertake to constitute a
returning- board? We in the Thirty-ninth
District will make our returns to the
place designated in the call. I did not
understand the object of this meeting or
1 would not have been here."
The motion was put to vote and car
ried.
Samuels then offered a resolution to the
effect that the chairman and secretary
of each district commit.ee should issue
credentials to delegates whom their can
vass showed to have been elected. The.
resolution was adopted.
The other measure fathered by Samuels,
that cards of admission to polling places
issued by the chairman and secretary of
the County Central Commniee should not
be recognized, was lost sight of, but after
adjournment blank cards of admission, to
be filled out and signed by the chairman
and secretary of the district committee,
were distributed to the committeemen
present; also blank certificates of election,
to be furnished by them to the delegates
chosen in their districts.
As a result of the rump meeting the
districts in which Kelly-Crimmins com
mitteemen are in the majority will send
their returns to Shiels Hall, where they
will be canvassed under the supervision
of Martin Kelly. Returns from other dis
tricts will be sent to the County Central
Committee headquarters and canvassed
by the returning board.
"We believe that at least nine of the
eighteen districts." said Augustus Tilden,
chairrtian of the rump meeting, last night,
"will send us their returns. We count on
the Twenty-eighth, Twenty-ninth, Thirty
llrst. Thirty-second, Thirty-sixth, Thirty
seventh, Thirty-eighth, Forty-third and
Forty-fifth districts."
In several of these the favorable atti
tude of the committeemen to the bosses
is not assured and their returns may go
to the regular returning board.
There are indications of a bitter fight
in the Forty-fourth Assembly District.
The tickets there are known as Ruef and
anti-Ruef. The Ruef ticket is classed by
the County Committee as the regular
! ticket. Hot times are expected in the
Twenty-ninth, Thirtieth, Thirty-first,
Thirty-third and Thirty-fourth districts.
There will be an interesting contest and
! a very large vote in the Forty-first As
| sembly District, but no rowdyism is ex
| peeled. The business men, taxpayers and
I workingmen of Republican faith have re
polved to turn out and elect an anti-Dib
ble delegation. The young men of tho
Korty-Jlrst are leading the opposition to
Dibble. Special care should be taken to
inspect the ticket before depositing tho
ballot. Dibble has placed some prominent
men on the State delegate ticket. The
pil/lile joker Is in the Legislative and
judicial ticket.
In order that the voters of the Forty
first District may not be misled or con
fused The Call publishes beneath in paral

Crowley, the boatman, was drowned off

The boy was rowing about in a white

filled him with panic. Eyewitnesses say
that the boy gave one look at the ap
proaching tug and then dived over the

have become seized with cramps, as the
water was smooth and the distance to the
wharf short. After swimming a tew

In the case of Charles G. Adams, who
shot and killed Edgar S. Kepner, the
jury at a late hour last night returned a
verdict of murder in the second degree.
On the opening of court yesterday morn

argument on behalf of the defendant. He

Alford made the closing argument on be

and shortly after 5 o'clock it retired to

Â¦ The trial of the defendant proved to the
satisfaction of court and Jury that the im

enmity caused by Adams' discharge by
Kepner on the ground that the defendant
had displeased the dead man's customers.
That Mrs. Kepner's Â¦ name was wrong
fully connected with the killing of her

After the prizefight spectators had left
the pavilion last ni?ht and the lights had
been extinguished the janitors detected
the odor of gas in the building and started
to locate the leak. The men carried
torches, and when they opened the door
of the closet in which the meters are lo
cated a volume of gas blew out and was
ignited by the torches. An explosion fol
lowed and the woodwork waa soon in
flames. An alarm was turned In from box
72 and the Fire Department after a few
minutes', work extinguished the blaze.
The men were treated at the hospital by
Dr. Dray. They are not seriousjy injured.

After visiting the medical centers ot

Geary; hours 1 to 3 and 7 to 8 p. m. â¢
derided the spectacular presentation of
relatives there with a distinct under
standing that her stay In California was
to be but temporary, and she would re
turn. Accepting thtse as facts. Hassett
quoted at length from Supreme Court de
cisions to support his contention that the
Public Administrator and not Mrs. Mur
ray should administer upon the estate of
Mrs. Townsend.
Mrs. Murray's Claims Defended.
When he had concluded Matt I. Sullivan
followed, maintaining that every fact in
the case demonstrated that Mrs. Murray
had come here to stay permanently. She
had determined to be with her mother,
to comfort her for her remaining days.
Mrs. Murray had solemnly promised her
mother to do this, and in all good faith
she is keeping that promise. She Is here
to protect her mother';? property, and she
should be given the right to do so. The
attorney- then quoted at great length from
the very same authorities which had so
encouraged Attorney Hassett. .',Â¦â¢-
The concluding addresses of the day had
apparently nothing to do with the record
In the case. They were nothing more no.
less than an exchange ol hot shot between
opposing attorneys, neither of whom saw
anything but evil motives In the other.
Ex-Judge Sullivan denounced the "in
decent" haste of the Public Administrator,
the schemes of designing persons and the
morbid curiosity of the public." He pic
tured Mrs. Murray as a dutiful daughter,
crossing the continent to protect her aged
and rapidly declining mother from a bold,
bad, divorced husband and other design
ing persons, who were bent upon securing
some part of the estate.
The speaker told of the heroic struggles
of Mrs. Murray to save her mother's
property, and Mrs. Murray weeplngly
bowed her head In her hands at the
touching words. The Attorney referred in
terms of familiarity to the Deity to em
phasize his demands that the daughter
should receive letters of administration
and that the wicked and indecent Public
Administrator should be thrust Into outer
darkness, beyond the reach of court
favor.
Case Closes in Bitterness.
Mr. Hassett**brlstled at the reference to
his client, and when his turn came he
had also to say something about Inde
cency, mystery and designing persons,
for Mrs. Murray he professed the kindliest
feelings, "but he Insisted that It was she
who had shown indecent haste In grab
bing at the $600,000 which her mother had
left, shutting out of the house her mother
had made a : haven for the downtrodden,
and forbidding entry to friends and rela
tives, perhaps even to some of the poor,
dear soldiers whom Mrs. Townsend had
befriended.
Mr. Hassett's blood seemed to boil at
the very thought, and he insisted that the
court must Issue letters of administration
to Patrick Boland. And If the court did
not do so Mr. Hassett wanted to warn
Mrs. Murray that. she would lose the ad
vantage of an administration that in ex
pense would not be a bagatelle to what
It will be if the Public Administrator doe.*

William Harris, a man about 30 years
of age, was held to answer before the
Superior Court yesterday by Judge Mn
gan on a charge of burglary In COOO
bonds. He entered the house of Mrs.
Mary Heffernan. 1310 Mission street, Au
gust 11. and stole a gold watch. He was
arrested two days later. Harris claimed
that he was a victim of mistaken Iden
tity. He says a man closely resembling
him commits offenses and he is blamed
for them. Over a year ago the man and
Harris were both arrested for burglary
and both were hel<i to answer before the
Superior Court. Harris was able to provÂ»
that the other man must have committed
the burglary, and he was set at liberty
and his double was sent to San Quentin
for a year. Harris" attornev promised on
WednÂ»-s.lay to bring the "double" int.)
court, but failed to find him, and .-aid iv
would have him when the case came up
for trial in the upper court.

the document in court. ' With this he
', closed, and Judge Dunne announced that
the case was submitted.
Attorney Hassett then attempted to In
troduce evidence to show that Mrs.'Town
send was deeply angered at the presence
of her daughter in this city and certainly
wanted her to ' return to her Massachu
setts home. Judge Dunne ruled that the
mother's feelings played no part in the
daughter's intention and could not be con
sidered proper evidence In the. case. The
proffered testimony was therefore ruled
out. Â¦
Attorney Hassett insisted, however, in
having it identified, and for that purpose
It was allowed on the record. It consisted
of a postal card and a telegram pent by
Mrs. Townsend to her brother-in-law.
Charles C. Crawford, after the arrival of
Mrs. Ella F.' Murray in San Francisco.
The postal card and the telegram were
both addressed to the Boston home of
Charles â¢ C. Crawford. The postal card
reads aa follows:
"Dear C: Wired you Ella -was here.
Came home last eve about 9 o'c and found
her seated In the hall. The Chinaman let
her In. I .was simply parllzed. She' Is at
the Hotel. I will not have her In tho
house with me. What am I to do. Will
write , to-morrow."
The telegram read as follows: ,
"Ella is here. Am terribly shocked.
Isn't awful. A. S. TOWNSEXD.*'
Hassett Pleads for Boland.
With this rejected testimony Attorney
Hassett closed his case and began his ar
gument. As a preliminary he cleared
away every supposed , Issue except one â
the question of; the bona fide resident of
California. It was admitted that Mrs.
Murray is the daughter : of Mrs. Town
send. .It was "most emphatically denied
that she is a resident of this State. Has
sett argued that It makes no difference
what we may "think of the hardship which
may be infltcted. We- are. not superior to
the law, and ; must "obey it. The law de
mands -that an administratrix must be a
resident of ; this â¢ State. .
The'attorney insisted that, all. the facts
In the case . show _ conclusively that â¢' MrB.
Murray never Intended Â¦ to . remain here
and-she retained her residence and home
In Dorchester. She left her friends . and
** S far as the courts are concerned
I \ there will be no developments In the
i^\ Townsend case, for a few days at
I least. The applications of Mrs. Ella
* ' .;'-.;' F. Murray and of Public Adminis
trator Boland for letters of administra
tion have been presented and submitted
and the matter is now In the hands of Su
perior Judge Frank H. Dunne for decision.
The hearing of the application of Thomas
T. Townsend, the ex-husband, is set for
the 30th inst., but It is not likely that the
gentleman will press his petition If he
has to swear that he is the surviving hus
band of Mrs. Townsend.
The opposing attorneys accepted the op
portunity yesterday in closing the case
to call one another names. Mrs. Murray
was pictured on the one hand as a design
ing, greedy woman, rushing In eager,
indecent haste to grasp her mother's for
tune, and on the other as a patient, care
ful, devoted daughter. Inspired to protect
and console her mother while alive and
guard her estate from ravenous attorneys
and others when dead. Ex-Judge -Sulli
van and M. C. Hassett spoke very plainly
of one another and hard words were ex
changed with the readiness of compli
ments. :
The court gave full rein to the heated
argument, which had absolutely nothing
whatever to do with the case or the Issues
involved. It served simply to show that
Ex-Judge Sullivan and M. C. Hassett do
not entertain a very high opinion of one
another. During the angry debate Mrs.
Murray wept softly or glared defiantly as
the mood" and the speaker affected her.
The lady has, notwithstanding this fact,
a most superb control of her emotions
and their expression. She insists upon
doing as she likes and In the way she
likes, a fact which makes the position of
cross-examiner a trifle embarrassing.
Mrs. Townsend Feared Her Daughter
. M. C. Hassett opened and closed the
case for the Public Administrator very
quickly. Having been denied a continu
ance by the court the attorney, had prac
tically no evidence to present. He placed
Mrs. Ella F. Murray on' the witness stand
and asked her if her mother's statement,
that she had sold her Callfornta-street
home and was working there as a house
keeper, was true. The witness was about
to answer when Attorney Matt I. Sullivan
declared that Mrs. Townsend's statement
was not true. This in a measure illus
trates the eccentric character of the old
woman and helps to destroy the, value of
her bitter arraignment of her- daughter,
which she mado so recently before her

At the meeting- of the parade commit
tee last night it was decided to call the
attention of the general committee to the
letter of Willis 1 Polk to the Board of Pub
lic Works, in which he says that the
decoration committee had eent a circular
to merchants and others who propose to
decorate buildings, requesting that they
confine their decorations to a display of
flags as lavish as they desire, but simple
in arrangement. It is believed that the
request will interfere with the desire of
people to decorate. The parade commit
tee favors that portion of the letter which
objects to the granting of special permits
to erect arches. A liquor firm obtained
such a permit from the board because no
objection was presented.

Federation of Mission Improvement
Clubs Scores City Officials for
Negligence. -:,V
The Federation of Mission Improvement
Clubs petitioned the Board of Supervisors
yesterday to provide cells In the new
Mission police station. Tho petition
states that the city Is paying a rental o:
JGO per month for the present quarters on
Seventeenth! street, and $50 additional for
a stable.. The federation recommends an
expenditure of $2000 for the cells, instead
of $5000 or $6000 as recommended by thÂ»
architect. A stable of wood could also be
built instead of the brick building, whlcM
would cost $10,000. The petition concludes:
"Had our city officials exercised proper
diligence arid shown tne same regard for
tbe taxpayers as they would for their own
private affairs this branch of the Police
Department would to-day be occupying
the structure that so far cost the tax
payers $34,000. Fifty per cent more money
is demanded for the work proposed than
is actually necessary, and it is about
time that our city officials look more
closely after the interests of the city."

TO ABOLISH POOLROOMS.
After the Price matter was disposed of
temporarily, Chief Sullivan referred to a
resolution passed last July by the Board
of Supervisors asking him to consult with
the District Attorney' as to Introducing
ordinances for the consideration of the
board for tho more efficient suppression of
public gambling. He said he had pre
pared two ordinances which he read. One
was making it unlawful for any person
to play cards or dice for money or checks
in any saloon, cafe or public place or for
the proprietor of any saloon, cafe or pub
lic place to suffer cards or dice games to
be played. An exception was made in
the case of private clubs or social or
ganizations who have a permit from the
commissioners. The second was one mak
ing it: unlawful for any person to visit
such places with tho same exception. This
is aimed to put a stop to poker playing
in such places as the Cafe Royal. The
Chief was asked to consult with the Djs
trict Attorney on the subject.

The matter was informally discussed
and it was pointed out that the resigna
tion was sent in on the condition that its
acceptance was qualified by the provision
that the officer be placed on the pension
list. If not placed on the pension list
then the resignation would not be accept
ed. His retirement followed shortly after
his disratement from lieutenant to ser
geant. In asking for it he simply follow
ed the custom that had been In vogue.
He was recalled for active duty recently,
but the fact of his resignation was not
then known.
Resignation of Sergeant William Price as a
member of the Police Department of this city
and to be retired under the provisions of sec
tions 4 and 5 of the pension law considered.
On motion and by unanimous vote of the board
it was accepted, to date July 12. 1S99.
To the Honorable the Board of Police Com
missioners. City and County of San Francisco-
Gentlemen: I herewith tender my resignation
as a member of this department and ask that
I may be retired under the provisions of sec
tions 4 and 5 of the pension law. Thanking
you kindly for the many favors received, 1
am, gentlemen, respectfully,
WILLIAM PRICE, Sergeant of Police.
The - minutes of the same date contain
the following:
The i president said he had ascertained
that Sergeant Price was not a member
of the department and, therefore, not
entitled to draw a pension. He had tend
ered his resignation to the old board on
July 12 last year and It was accepted at
a meeting held the same day. The an
nouncement came as a surprise to the
other commissioners and It was decided
to defer consideration of the matter- till
the next meeting as It was Intimated that
others who were now receiving a pension
were In the same position as Price.
Price's letter of resignation was sub
mitted. It reads:
Another complication has arisen tn the
fight on the part of Police Sergeant Wil
liam Price to be restored to his former
rank of lieutenant. The new trouble was
