LETTER OF ACCEPTANCE
(Continued . on' Second 'Â¦ Page.)
INSTRUCTIONS TO THE
PHILIPPINE COMMISSION
President McKinley Advises Regard
ing the Future Government of
the Islands.
WASHINGTON. Sept. 17.â The. instruc
tions of President McKinley to the Philip- ;
pine Commission were made public here
to-day. They brar the date of April '7,
1900, and are addressed to the Secretary of
War. At the outset the President says:
"It Is probable that the transfer of au
thority from military commanders to
civil officers will be gradual and will oc
cupy a considerable poriod. Its success
ful aocompltehmont and the maintenance 'Â¦
of peace and order in the meantime will
require the most perfect co-operation be- |
twet-n the civil and military authorities In
Iht; islands and both should be directed
during tha transition period by the samo
executive department. Tlie commission
will therefore report to the Secretary of
War and all their action will be subject
to his approval and control."
The President instructs that on Septem
ber 1. 1900, that part of the power of gov
ernment of the Philippines which Is of an
executive nature shall pass from the mil
itary governor to the commission. Of the
duties of the latter he says that without
hampering them with too specific instruc
tions, they should be enjoined* first, to
establish municipal .arovernments, giving
to the natives the opportunity to manage
their own local affairs to the fullest ex
tent of which they are capable and sub
ject to the least degree of supervision and
control consistent with the maintenance
of order, and second, tc extend the gov
ernment by the natives to the large t ad
ininistra-tions corresponding to counties
or provinces. He adds:
"Whenever the commission .Is of the
opinion that the condition of affairs In the
Philippines is such that the central ad
ministration may safely be ; transferred
from military to civil control, they will
report that conclusion to you. with their
recommendations as to the form of cen
tral government to be established for the
purpose of taking. over . thÂ» control."'

ADDITIONAL LIST OF
GALVESTON'S DEAD
of raw material has. but .one purchaser, and
must sell at the arbitrary price \ fixed; the
laborer has but one employer, and is powerless
to protest against Injustice, either in. wages or
In conditions of labor: the small stockholder
is at the mercy of the speculator, while the
traveling salesman contributes his salary to
the overgrown profits of the trust. Since but
a small proportion of the people can share; in
the advantages secured by private . monopoly,
it follows that the remainder of the people
are. not only excluded from the benefits, Â¦ but
are the.helplese victims of every monopoly or
ganized. It Is difficult to overestimate the
immediate injustice that may be done, . or \o
calculate, the ultimate effect of this Injustice,
upon the social and political welfare of : the
people. Our platform, after suggesting certain
specific remedies, pledges the party to ah un
ceasing warfare against private monopoly In
nation. State and city. I heartily, approve of
this promise; If elected. It shall be my earnest
and constant endeavor to fulfill 'the promise
In letter and spirit.'. I shall select. an Attorney
General who will, without fear or. favor, enforce
existing laws; I shall recommend- such addition
al legislation' as may be necessary to dissolve
every private monopoly which does business'
outside of the Â£tate of Its origin; and. if con
trary to my belief, and hope, a constitutional
amendment is found to be necessary, I shall
recommend such an amendment as will, with
out Impairing any of the existing rights of the
States, empower Congress to protect the people
of all the States from Injury at the hands .of
individuals or ' corporations engaged in inter
state commerce. .
The platform accurately describes the Dlngley
tariff law, when It condemns It as a "trust
breertlrÂ»5 measure, skillfully devised to give to
the few favors which th^y do not deserve, and
to place upon, the many burdens which they
should-not-. bear." -Under Its operation .-trusts
can plunder the p'eople-of the United States,
while they successfully- compete in foreign mar
kets with manufacturers of other countries.
Even those who Justify -the general policy of
protection will find it difficult to defend a tariff
which enables a' trust to exact an exorbitant
toll from the citizen.
?* Corporations in Politics.
The Democratic party makes no war upon
honestly: acquired : neither does . It
seek to embarrass corporations engaged In le
gitimate business, but It does protest against
corporations entering politics, and attempt
ing to assume control of the instrumentalities
of government. A corporation is not organized
for political purposes, and should be compelled
to confine Itself to the business described In
Its charter. Honest corporations, engaged In
an honest business, will find it to their ad
vantase to aid in the enactment of such leg
islation ' aÂ« will protect them from the unde
served odium which will -be brought; upon
them by those corporations which enter the
political arena. . ..:: :' .; â¢;, f.

THE PLATFORM IS GOING TG HIS HEAD.
Â¦ S~^ HICAGO, Sept. if. â The letter of William J. Bryan accepting the- Democratic, nomination for
y^y President was given out to-day. Mr. Bryan has nothing to say concerning imperialism, the "para
mount" issue in the Kansas City platform, claiming that he fully covered the subject -in his recent
speech of acceptance. However, he rcviczvs the various planks in the Democratic platform and' renews
his pledge of four years ago not to seek a second term, if elected. The letter of acceptance is as follows:
Democratic party is pledged to legislation
whjch will empower the commission, to pro
ject individuals and communities from dis
crimination, and the public at large from un
just' *nd unfair transportation rates.
: . The Financial Plank.
The platform reiterates the demand contained
in the Chicago platform for an American finan
cial, system made by the American people for
themselves. The purpose of such a system is
to i .restore and maintain a bimetallic level of
prices;' and In order that there may be no un
certainty asjtoi the method of restoring bimet
allism^, the Specific declaration in favor of free
and unlimited coinage at the existing ''ratio of
15 Jo' l.i Independent of the action of other na
tions,, Is repeated. In 1836 the Republican party
recognized /the necessity of bimetallism by
pledging, the party to an earnest effort to se
cure an International agreement for the free
coinage 'of silver, and the President, immedi
ately after his Inauguration, by authority of
Congress, appointed a commission' composed. of
(Ilstlneulshed citizens, to. visit : Europe and so
llcUffortlgn aid. ' SjeeretaryoHay.-- In a letter
in November. 189s.
rftrid* afterward pubfisheTl In England, declared
that at that time the President ami a majority
of his Cabinet still believed In the great de
sirability " of an international agreement for
the restoration of the double standard, but that
it- did not seem opportune to reopen the nego
tiations Just then. The financial law enacted
lens than a year ago contains a concluding
seation declaring that the measure was not in
tended to stand in the way of the restoration
of bimetallism, whenever It could be done by
co-operation with tho other nations. The plat
iform submitted to the laÂ«t Kepubllcan con
vention with the indorsement of the* adminis
tration again suggested the possibility of se
curing foreign aid in restoring silver.
Now the Republican party, for the first time,
openly abandons Its advocacy of the double
standard, and Indorses the monetary system
which It has so often and so emphatically con
demned. The Democratic party, on the con
trary, remains the steadfast advocate of the
cold and sliver coinage of the constitution, and
is not willing that other nations shall determine
for us the time and manner of restoring silver
to its ancient place as a standard money. Thfc
ratio of 18 to 1 is not only the ratio now exist
ing; between all the sold and silver dollars In
circulation In this country, a ratio which even
the Republican administration has not attempt
ed to change, but It Is the only ratio advocated
by those who are seeking to reopen the mints.
"Whether the Senate, now hostile to bimetallism.
can.be chanted during this campaign or tho
campaign of 1902 can only be determined after
the votes are counted, but neither the present
nor the future political complexion of .Congress
has prevented or should prevent an. announce
ment of the party's position. upon this subject
i in unequivocal terms.

the House and Senate,*, Justifies the warning
given by. the Democratic party In 1S96. It ; was
then predicted that the Republican party would

The platform very property gives prominence
to the trust question. The appalling growth
of combinations In restraint of trade during
the present administration proves conclusively
that the Republican party lacks either the
desire of the ability to deal with the question
effectively. If. Â¦â¢ ma y fairly be assumed,
from the speeches and conduct of the Repub
lican leaders, that party does not Intend â¢ to
take the people's side b grains t these organiza
tions, then the weak and qualified condemna
tion 'of. trusts to be found In the Republican
platform is designed to distract attention while
industrial despotism Is completing Its work.. A
private monopoly has always been an outlaw.
No defense can be made of an industrial sys
tem in which one. or a few men, . can control
for their own profit the output or prleÂ© of any
'article of merchandise. Under such a, system
LINCOLN. Nebr.. Sept. 17. W00.
Hon. James D. Richardson/ "chairman, and
others of the notification committee of the
Democratic Xatlonol Convention â Gentlemen:
In accepting the nomination tendered by you
on behalf of the Democratic party I beg to
assure you of my appreciation of the great
honor conferred upon me by the delegates In
convention assembled and by the voters who
gave instruction to the delegates.
I am .sensible of the responsibilities which
rest upon the chief magistrate of so great a
nation, and realize the far-reaching effect of
the questions involved in the present contest.
In my leyer of acceptance of 18% I made the
following pledge: / . ' ; .; ' .
â¢'So deeply am I Impressed with/the magni
tude of the power vested by the constitution
in the chief executive of the nation and with :
the enormous Influence which he can wield for
the benefit or Injury of the people, that I wish
to enter the office, if elected, free from any
personal desire, except the desire to prove
worthy of the confidence of my countrymen.
Human Judgment Is fallible enough when un
biased by selfish considerations, and, In order
that I may not be tempted to use the patron
age of the office to advance any personal am
bition,' I hereby announce, with all the em
phasis which words can express, my . fixed de
termination not, under any circumstances, to
be a candidate for re-election. In case this cam
paign results In my election."
Further reflection and observation constrain
me to renew this pledge.
The platfrom* adopted at Kansas City com
mands my cordial and unqualified approval. It
courageously meets the Issues now before the
country and states clearly and without am
biguity the party's position on every question
considered. Adopted by a convention which
assembled on the anniversary of the signing of
the Declaration of Independence, It breathes
thÂ»! spirit of candor, independence and patriot-
Ism which characterized those who. at Phila
delphia ' In 1"7Â«. promulgated the creed of the
republic.
Having in my notification speech discussed
somewhat at length the paramount issue, lm
perlalipm. and added some observations on mil
itarism and the Efcoer war, It is sufficient at
this time to review the remaining planks of the
platform. _

GOMPERS PREDICTS
VICTORY FOR MINERS
SHAMOKIN. 1'a.. Sept. 17.â The col
lieries operated by the Miners' Union,
FhiiacV.phla and Heading Coal and Iron
companies and by individual operators la
the suburbs of this place and employing
between 0r,09 and I0,fi00 men and boys,
Â¦w-r.re completely tied up this morning by
the strike. At the United MJneworker*
headquartf-rs the leaders claim that 75 pcÂ«
cesit of the workers In the Mount Carmel
and Locust Gap districts did not report
for work. The operator* had no figures to
give out. Several fist lights occurred be
tween strikers and men going to work.
President John Fancy of the Ninth Dis
trict, United Mlneworkers, said that be
fore the end of the week all the operations
In Sch-aylklll and Cumberland counties
would be Idle.
President Gompera of the American
of Labor said towiay that
-re Â«s no doubt as to final victory for
i'.-<- men as the conditions were so ex
tremely bad that any movement oh their
part would be advantageous, and Inas
much as the movement is bo general. the
advantage would be correspondingly
treat.
VTTLKESBARRE. Pa.. Sept. 17.â Colonel
C. B. Dougherty, one of the officials of
the Eupquehanna Coal Company, stated
to-car that he had information from the
Lyker.s Valley and Shamokln district that
all collieries of the company In this sec
tion were in operation with a larger force
than ever. The only place where the com
cary suffers Is at Xanticoke. Dougherty
thir.ks the company will be able to meet
all market orders despite the suspension
et Nar.Uccke. The operators' here think
the strike cannot last long If the mines In
other parts of the anthracite region con
tinue at work, as the strikers will not be
content to see their brethren in the
Schuylklll and Shamokin regions making
big wages while they remain idle.
NEW YORK. Sept. 17.â William V. S.
Theme, a director of the Pennsylvania
Coal Company, made this statement to
day after a talk with the company's mine
ruperlnter.dent ever the long distance
wire:
"We operate thirteen collieries and all
but two are closed. The etrike appears to
be quite peneraJ throughout the mining
districts. Many men have reported at our
m'.nes. but hardly enough to Justify work
ing the two collieries, ao that it is prob
able that they will bo closed. The tie
up will doubt>ss last a week, and then
the men will begin to cct dissatisfied and
will war.t to return to work. The miners
have no grievances and as far as we can
learn they have not enough resources to
carry on a protracted Ftrike. The miners
r*Â«eive on an avpragf $2 43 a day. I have
dpvot seen R-year-old boys or girls at
Â¦work In the mines. Tho miners arc ask
ing for an Increase of from t*>n to fifteen
jvr cent In wages. The operators can
Y\r,\<*. out for at least s'.x months. It Is
customary to carry out our books for six
months in advance. We have a fair sup
ply on hand. Retailers, especially in the
country, have rood sized stocks. I think
the situation Justifies an advance in
prices. We anticipate no trouble at our
mines. Extra watchmen have been hired,
but this 5s the only precaution which Â»Â«
have takpn."
THINK THE STRIKE
CANNOT LAST LONG
HAZELTOJC. Pa.. Sept. 17.â The
great struggle between the an
thracite coal miners of Pennsyl
vania and their employers was
begun to-day. Each eide Is conn
dent of winning and neither of the con
tending forces shows any disposition to
yield. The contest thus far has been
devoid of â¢violence. The exact number
of men who struck cannot at this time be
told. Reports received by the United
Mine Workers' officials from the entire
anthracite region were to them most sat
isfactory. In this territory, known as
district 7, there are 16,000 men employed
In and about the mines. Of this number
it Is conservatively estimated that about
50 per cent, or SO00 miners, obeyed the
order of President Mitchell to quit work.
Five thousand of these belong to the col
lieries which did not work at all, and the
remaining 3000 to mines which work short
handed. The district south of this place,
known as the south slfle, was tied up com
pletely, with the exception of Coleraln,
Beaver Meadow and Carsons Washeries.
In this territory the United Mine 'Workers
are very 6trong. On the north side, the
Upper Lehlgh, Mllnesvllle, Ebervale and
Drlfton No. 1 collieries, employing about
1500, are Bhut down. The mines at Lat
tlmer and Pond Creek, employing 1200. are
working full, but every other mine In that
big territory Is working with badly crip
pled forces. Three of the Markle mines,
over which there has been so much con
tention, worked all day with about 65 per
cent of the men. On the west side every
colliery started up to-day minus Its union
men except at the Hazle mines, where the
union miners went to work in consequence
of a misunderstanding.
Hazleton presented an animated appear
ance to-day, strikers from all the sur
rounding towns coming in early in the day
and gathering in groups on the street cor
ners and discussing the situation. It
was a most orderly crowd. Around Btrike
headquarters at the Valley Hotel there
was more or less of a crowd of men all
day. President Mitchell, who arrived
from the West last night, was kept busy
all day and evening receiving reports from
every section of the region. Messengers
bringing information to him from near-by
points kept coming regularly.
Mr. Mitchell decided an Important point
to-day in the matter of arbitration. Last
week the miners employed by G. B.
Markle & Co. decided not to strike until
the firm had passed upon a set of their
grievances, which differ somewhat from
those of the T'nitod Mine Workers. The
firm has an agreement with its men that
if any differences fall of adjustment then
the grievances shall be arbitrated. John
Markle of the firm yesterday agreed to
have Archbishop Rvan of Philadelphia
arbitrate the differences if the mediators
already agreed upon by" the firm and the
men cannot come to a satisfactory agree
ment.
President Mitchell, however, stated to
day that he should ask the men employed
by Markle to cease work. The men em
ployed by Markle might gain concessions
through arbitration, he said, but It was
now a case of securing a uniform settle
ment throughout the anthracite region.
About 100 foreign-ppeaking miners left
Hazelton to-day for New York, where
they will % take a steamer for Europe.
These men expect a long strike and rather
than remain Idle here they preferred to go
to their former homes.
PHILADELPHIA. Sept. 17.â The
great evrike- of the miners In thÂ«
anthracite coal fielfls of Pennsyl
vania, which represent practically
the hard coal output of the world.
Â¦began to-day. According to President
'litche'.l of the United Mine Workers of
America, who Is personally directing the
etrtke from h!s headquarters at Hazelton.
the euceoss of the first day's efforts to tic
â¢up the mines exceeded the expectations
of the strike leaders. The hard coal re
gion is divided into four great districts,
Â¦shÂ«? Larkawanna. Wyoming. Lehlgh. and
Fch'jylktll regions. In the first two, rep
ros^r.t'nf? nearly 90,000 men, the tie up iÂ«
practically complete. Only onÂ© mine, em
ploying a few hundred men. is being
operated, and this the strikers say they
Impe to close soon. In the Lehlgh region
the situation is a stand-off, about S0O0
<->f the 16,000 employes having quit. Prin
cipally because the union has compara
tively little strength In the Schuylklll re
jrion ar.4 the workmen there have- no de
cided grievance," as In other districts, the
FT'rikp was not general among the upward
of 50.000 men employed.
Indications to-night, however, point to
the closing to-morrow of some mines in
the last named district that operated to
day, de-spite the assertion of officials of
the Philadelphia and Reading Coal Com
pany and other companies operating in
the- r^ion that they will continue- their
collieries in operation. Nearly all the
effort* of the Ftrike leaders are being de
roted to organizing the men In the weak
Scbuytkffl and I>hlgh regions, and to
:;!?!;t thrfr organisers end orators are re
dOuWlnp' tKAir pflortÂ«.
No violence worth mentioning has
tnarrpfl the first day of the struggle.
Practically no progress has yet been made
In the efforts of some of the clergy to
bring about a settlement of the trouble
through arbitration.
T T 'AZELTON, Pa., Sept. 17.â President Mitchell of the
J[ jf United Mine Workers' Union gave out the follozving state
ment to~night:
"Information received up to to-night slwzvs that 112,-
OOO mine zcorkers are on strike in the anthracite region. Of this
number 72,000 are in District 1, $0,000 in District 5 and 10,000
in District 7.
"Reports received are to the effect thai a large number of those
velio went to the mines to-day will join in tlie suspension to-morrow.
"The number of men norv out on strike exceeds that of any
other industrial contest in tlie history of our country"

GREATEST STRIKE
OF CENTURY BEGUN
IN COAL REGIONS
The largest sale of securities that has taken place in this city
during the last ten years was held yesterday, when securities of the
Piper estate to the amount of Â§622,953 50 were disposed of to the
highest bidders by the executors of the estate. The prices were ex*
tremely satisfactory.
ONE of the most Important sales of
securities negotiated In this State
In years Â¦was consummated yester
day by the Union Trust Company.
Securities valued at more than
half a million dollars were purchased by
the leading brokers and banking Institu
tions of the State. They'were part of the
estate of the late William A. Piper and
were ordered disposed of by Judge Troutt
of the Probate Court. -The United States
bonds and shares in big corporations in
thl3 State belonging to the estate were
placed on sale by the executors, William
Giselman and the Union Trust Company,
and were sold to the highest bidders. The
bids were opened by I. W. Hellman Jr.,
In the presence of the Interested parties,
and the aggregate of the amounts offered
for the various securities was $622,953 50.
A circular was sent to the leading brok
ers and bankers of this city by the Union
Trust Company inviting them" to bid on
the securities, a list of which was sub
mitted. Nearly a score of brokers and
representatives of mercantile and bank-
Ing institutions congregated in the direct
ors' room of the Union Trust Company
and heard the reading of their bids on the
bonds and stocks. Promptly at noon, the
time fixed for the opening of the envelopes
containing the offers of those present, L
W. Hellman Jr., cashier of the trust
company, opened the sealed packets and
read the bids.
Among those present at this important
ceremony were: George Tourny, secretary
of the German Savings and Loan Society;
Robert M. Welch, assistant cashier of the
San Francisco Savings Union: Henry S.
Manhelm of the firm of Manhelm. Dib
bern & Co.; John Perry Jr., Worthington
Ames, Henry Berle, A. W. Moore, D. R.
Wilson, A. L. Langerman, A. G. Hell
mann. Colonel M. H. tlecht of Hecht
Brothers & Co. and other men well known
In financial circles. William Giselman,
who is an executor of the estate of Wil
liam A. Piper, was also present and took
part In the proceedings.
There was an air of suppressed excite
ment in the directors' room during the
opening of the bids. Stocks and bonds
amounting to thousands of dollars were
placed within the reaah of everybody and
those present awaited eagerly to learn
what their rivals in business had offered
for the gilt-edged securities. John Perry
Jr., the venerable broker, occupied a seat
close to the table on which reposed the
bids. He was nervous and even more ex
cited than his fellow-bidders. He could
not restrain himself at times and when
some bid was not prepared In accordance
with his Judgment of* the rules prescribed
in matters of that kind he would object to
It on the ground that it was general in
form and did not state the number of se
curities. Mr. Perry bid on a number of
the securities and was among the fortu
nate ones who had their bids, accepted.
Eighteen bids were in the hands of Mr.
Hellman at the noon hour and he read
each one aloud to the interested assem
blage. There were two "blanket" bids
among the collection, but neither was ac
cepted, because the total of the individual
bids was more than that offered by the
bidders for all the securities, who were
the San Francisco Savings Union and the
brokerage firm of A. Barth & Co.
The acceptance of bids by the executors
resulted in the following transactions,
subject to the final ratification of Judge
Troutt:
Two hundred shares of Spring Valley
Water Company stock were sold to Man
helm. Dlbbern & Co. for $19,171.
Four hundred shares of Oakland Gas,
Light and Heat Company stock were pur
chased by H. Berle for $19,642.
Six hundred shares of San Francisco
Gas and Electric Light stock were sold
to Manheim, Dibbern & Co. for $31,S0O.
Six hundred shares of San Frandsco
Gas Light stock were sold to M. Meyer
for $3000.
Omnibus Cable Railway Company Â»
per cent bonds, of the par value of $50,000,
were sold to John Perry Jr. for $105,000.
Spring Valley "Water "Works 6 per cent
bonds, of the par value of $53,000, were sold
to John Perry Jr. for $51,276.

islands. The storm set in this morning
and is raging with increasing severity this
afternoon. Heavy cyclone rollers arc
sweeping in upon the coast and a strong
northeast g-ale is blowing. AH the tele
graph wires have been blown down and
this dispatch was sent to the cable office
in Hamilton by messenger on horseback.
Southeast rollers began to wash the
chores yesterday, but the barometer con
tinued high. During the night, however,
it commenced falling, showing 1*0.91 inches
at 7 o"clock in the morning. The wind
was rising. By noon it had reached a
gale force from the northeast and rain
was falling. The barometer then recorded
23.71 Inches.
The -storm continued to Increase dur

wind was blowing more than sixty miles
;in hour, carrying away telegraph wires.
Heavy seas are rushing In upon the
coasts. It is impossible to ascertain .the
damage done. The barometer continues
to fall, recording only 29.32 inches now,
but the wind has veered to north, al

BOSTON, Sept. 17.â Ex-Governor D. H.
Chamberlain, one of the most prominent
old school Republican leaders of this
State, in a hot open letter to Hon. Andrew
D. White* Minister to Germany, comes out
stronp for Bryan. He says in part:
I shall not do more as to your arraignment of
the positions cf â¢ Bryan and the Democratic
party in 1836 than to remark that I substan
tially agreed with you then and voted accord
ingly.- Now, 1 am a cordial, unhesitating sup
porter of Bryan, and bo far as such support
makes me a supporter ofnhe party which nomi
nated him at Kansas City I am an advocate,
equally cordial and unhesitating, of the Demo
cratic party. I do not support Bryan because I
approve all he represents or all the Items of
the Kansas City platform, though I will say
parenthetically that I regard that platform as
on the whole the best piece of political con
struction in spite of Its faults we have had
since the first platform on which Abraham Lin
coln was elected.
I supported McKinley in 1896 as a strict choice
of evils, but I am bound to confess the result
has come nigh to creating the gravest doubt
or the safety of ever making a choice of evils.
If the gold standard needed further protection
and strsngthlng, as It does not, I had as a gold
man as lief truat the work to Bryan and
the Democratic party as to President Hanna
and your party.
I did not support McKinley In 1S96 because I
fully indorsed either him or his party, but only
as a very tough choice of evils.
I knew, as did all who knew him at all. "that
he was weak and flabby of fiber, the mere
puppet of men who Ftood behind the McKinley
tariff, not even an accident or dark horse, but
the logical, characteristic candidate of men like
Hanna. The sequel has verified all these ante
cedent opinions of McKinley. Called by loath
some flattery #1 the best beloved of all our Presi
dents," he has proven himself, perhaps, the
weakest, morally and Intellectually, of all
those who have held the office In our century
and more of constitutional life.

attempt to retire the greenbacks, although the
party and its leaders studiously concealed their
Intentions. That purpose Is now plain and the
people must choose between the retention of the
greenback. Issued and controlled ,ln= volume by
the Government, and a national isank note cur
rency Issued by banks and controlled In their
own interests. If the national bank notes Â«re
to be secured by bonds, the currency system
now supported by the Republican party involves
a permanent and Increasing debt, and, so long
as this system stands, the financial classes will
be tempted to throw their powerful influence
upon the side of any measure which will con
tribute to the size and vermanency of a na
tlon.il debt. It Is hardly conceivable that the
American people will deliberately turn from the
debt-paying policy of the past, to the danger
ous doctrine of perpetual bonds.
Election of Senators by the People.
The demand for a constitutional amendment
provldfng for the election of Senators by direct
vote of the people appears for the first time in
a Democratic national platform, but a resolu
tion proposing such an amendment has three
times passed the House of Representatives, and
that, too. practically without opposition. What
ever may have been the reasons which secured
the adoption of the present plan, a century ago,
new conditions have made It Imperative that
the people be permitted to speak directly in the
selection of their representatives in the Sen
ate. A Senator Is no' less the representative
of the State because he receives his commission
from the people themselves, rather than from
the members of the State Legislature. If a
voter Is competent to vote for a member of
Congress, for State officers and for President,
he is competent to choose his representative in
the Senate. A system which makes the Senator
responsible for his election to the people, as a
whole, and amenable to them If he misrepre
sents them, must commend Itself to those who
have confidence In the Intelligence and patriot-
Ism of the masses.
Direct Legislation.
The platform Indorses the principle of direct
legislation. This is already applied to the
more important questions in nation, State and
city. It rests upon the sound theory that the
people can be trusted, and that the more re
sponsive the Government Is to the will of the
people the more free it will be from misuse
and abuse. - â¢
The Labor Question.
Several planks of the labor platform are de
voted to questions in which the laboring
classes have an immediate interest, but which
more remotely affect our entire population.
While what is generally known as government
by Injunction is at present directed chiefly
against the employes of corporations when
there is a disagreement between them and their
employer, it involves a principle which con
c^rnÂ« every one. The purpose of the Injunc
tton In such cases is to substitute trial by
judge for trial by Jury, and is a covert blow
at the jury system. The abolition of govern
ment by Injunction Is as necessary tor the
protection of the reputation ot the court as It
is for the security of the citizen. Ulackstone
ir. defending trial by Jury says: "The Impar
tial administration of Justice, which secures
both our persons and our properties. Is the
great end of civil society, but if that be en
trusted entirely to the magistracy.' a select
Vv'dy of men, and those selected by the prince
such as enjoy the highest offices of the state,
their decisions In spite of their natural Integ
rity will have frequently an involuntary bias
toward those of their own rank and dignity.
It Is not to be expected from human nature
tliat the few should he always attentive to
the Interests and good of the many."
If the criminal laws are not sufficient for the
protection of property, they can be made more
severe, but a citizen charged with crime must
have his case tried before a Jury ot his peers.
Use of the Blacklist.
The blacklist an now emp!6yed In some
rlaces enables the employer to place the em
ploye under practical duress, for the skilled
laborers loses his independence when the em
ployers can not only discharge him, but pre
vent his securing any similar employment. The
blacklist enables employers to secure, by mu
tual agreement, that control ' over the wage
earners which a private monopoly exercises
without contract.
As to Arbitration.
T>epartment of Labor.
The platform renews the demand for arbitra
tion between corporations and their employes.
No one who has observed the friction which
arises between great corporations and their
numerous employes, can doubt the wisdom of
establishing an Impartial" court for the just
or.d equitable settlement of disputes. ThÂ» de
mand for arbitration ought to be supported as
heartily by the public, which suffers incon
venience because of strikes and lockouts, and
by the employers themselves, as by the em
ployes. The establishment of arbitration will
insure friendly relations between labor and.
capital, and render obsolete the growing prac
tice of calling in the army, to settle labor
troubles.
I cannot* too strongly emphasize the import
ance of the platform recommendation of the
establishment of a department of labor, with
a member of the Cabinet at Its head. When
wo remember how important a position the
laborer fills In our economic, social and po
litical fabric. It is hard to conceive of a valid
objection being made to this recognition of
hie services. Agriculture is already represent
ed in thn President's official household; the
army and navy have their representatives
there; the State Department, with its consular
service, and the Treasury Department, with
Its close connection with fiscal affairs. ! keep
thÂ» executive In.' touch with, the business and
commercial interests. A Cabinet officer truly
representative of the waxe-earning class would
bÂ« of invaluable aid, not only to the toilers,
but to the President.
Chinese Exclusion.
The Chinese exclusion act has proved an ad
vantage to the country,? and Its continuance
and strict enforcement, aÂ« well as its exten
sion to other similar races, are imperatively
necessary. Tho Asiatic Is so essentially dif
ferent frjm the American that he cannot be
assimilated with our population, and Is, there
fore, not desirable as a permanent citizen. His
?rwenne as a temporary laborer, preserving
his national Identity and maintaining a foreign
scale of wages and living, must ever prove an
injustice to American producers, a* well' as a
jterretcal source of irritation.
Pride Regarding Pensions.
The party expresses Its pride In the soldiers
and sailors of all our warn, and declares Us
purpose to deal generously with them and
their dependents. A liberal policy is natural
shown In opposing our sovereignty, they -will
not- require much assistance from us.
Extravagance Is Alleged.
The Republican party, drawing as it does
enormous campaign funds from those who en-
Joy special privileges at the hands of the Gov
ernment, is powerless to protect the tax payers
from the attack vof those who profit by large
appropriations. A surplus in the treasury of
fers constant temptation to extravagance, and
extravagance, in turn, compels a resort to new
means of taxation, which, being kept in the
background until the campaign is over. Is a
lair illustration of the Imposition which will
bo attempted when there is a considerable
amount of money idle In the treasury. The
lehabllltatlon of the merchant marine, laud
able In itself, is made the pretext for expendi
ture of public money for the benefit of large
ship owners and In the interests ot a transpor
tption monopoly. The Government being only
the agent of the people has no right to collect
from the people taxes beyond the legitimate
iiteds of a Government honestly and effectively
administered, and public servants should ex
ercise the same degree of care In the use of
the people's money that private Individuals do
In the use of their own money. With a restor
ation of a foreign policy consistent with Amer
ican Ideas there can be an Immediate and large
reduction in the burdens now borne by the
people.
Income Tax Plank.
By Inadvertence the income tax plank agreed
upon by the resolutions committee was omitted
from the platform as read and adopted. The
subject, however. Is covered by the reafflrm
ction of the Chicago platform, and I take this
occasion to reassert my belief in the principle
which underlies the income tax. Congress
should have authority to levy and collect an
Income tax whenever necessary, and an amend
ment to the Federal constitution specifically
conferring such authority ought to be supported
by even those who may think the tax unneces
sary at this time. In the hour of danger the
Government tan draft the citizen; It ought to
be able to draft the pocketbook as well. Un
less monoy Is more precious than blood, we
cannot afford to give greater protection to the
Incomes of the rich than to the lives of the
poor.
The Paramount Issue.
The subjects, however, treated in this letter.
Important as each may seem In Itself, do not
press bo Imperatively for solution as the ques
tion which the platform declares to be the para
mount Issue In this campaign. Whether we
shall adhere to or abandon those Ideas of
government which have distinguished this na
tion from other nations and given to Its history
H.j peculiar charm and value is a question the
settlement of which cannot be delayed. No
other question can approach It In Importance;
no other question demands such Immediate con
sideration. It is easier to lose a reputation
than to establish one. and this nation would
find It a long and laborious task to regain its
proud position among the nations if under the
stress of temptation It should repudiate the
eelf-evldent truth proclaimed by our heroic
ancestors and sacredly treasured during a
career unparalleled in the annals of time. When
the doctrine that the people are the only source
of power is made secure from further attack
we enn safely proceed to the settlement of the
numerous questions which involve the domestic
and economic welfare of our citizens.
Very truly yours.-
W. J. BRTAX.
and necessary in a government which depends
upon a citizen soldiery Instead of a large
standing army. Self-interest, as well as grati
tude, compels the government to make boun
tiful provision for those who, in the hour of
danger and at great sacrifice of business,
health and. life, tender their services to their
country.
The pension lawg should be construed ac
cording to the generous spirit which prompted
their passage. The platform very properly re
iterates the position taken in 1S9S, that the
fact of enlistment shall be deemed conclusive
evidence that the soldier was sound when the
Government accepted him. A certificate given
now to the health of a person forty years ag6.
even if easily obtainable, should not have as
much weight as the certificate of the medical
officer who examined the volunteer with a
view of ascertaining his fitness for army
servicÂ«.
Favors the Nicaragua Canal.
The Democratic party Is In favor of the Im
mediate construction, ownership and con
trol of the Nicaragua canal by the
United States. The failure of the Republican
parly to make any progress In carrying out a
pledge contained in Its platform four years ago,
together with the substitution ln'its latebt plat
form, of a plank favoring an isthmian canal
lor a specific declaration in favor of the Nicar
airuan canal, would Indicate that the Republi
can leaders either do not appreciate the Im
portance of this great waterway to the mari
time strength and commercial Interests of the
country, or that they give too much consider
ation to the interested opposition of transcon
tinental lines. The Hay-Pauncefote .treaty,
now before the Senate, would. If ratified,
urcally lessen the vahie of the canal, if it
would not indeed convert It 'Into a positive
menace In time of war. The paramount ln-
Wejas of the United States In the western
hemisphere, together with the obligations to
defend the republics to the south ot us. make
it r.ecessary that our Government shall be able
to close the canal against any hostile power.
Arizona, New Mexico and Oklahoma.
Arizona, N'ew Mexico and Oklahoma havo
long been ready to assume the responsibilities
and enjoy the privileges of statehood, and It
will be a pleasure, as well as a duty, to carry
out the platform pledge concerning them.
Alaska and Porto Rico.
There will be a popular acquiescence In the
demand for home rule, and a Territorial form
of government In Alaska and Porto Rico. Both
are entitled to local self-government and rep
resentation In Congress.
Right of the Cubans.
The recognition contained In both the Demo
cratic and Republican platforms or the right
of the Cubans to Independence removes the
general princlr-le Involved from the domain of
partisan i>elltlcs. It Is proper, however, to con
sider whether the accomplishment of this pur
pose can be safely entrusted to the Republican
party after It has yielded to the allurements of
the colonial idea, and abandoned Its earlier
faith in the natural and inalienable rights of
mon.
Reclamation of Arid Lands.
The time Is rlre fofl a systematic and ex
tended effort to reclaim tV:e arid lands and fit
them for actual settlers. The last agricultural
report estimates that homes can thus be pro
vided for many millions of people. The lm
poundlnu and use of the waters which are
wasted in the spring would people the Western
States with thrifty, intelligent and industrious
citizens, and those would furnish a valuable
market for all the products of the factories.
A small percentage of the money spent in a
war of conquest would provide occupation untl
habitation for more people than would ever
teek a residence In colonies within the tropics.
Foreign Alliances.
The reasons given by Washington. Jefferson
and the other Htatesmen of the eariy days in
support of the doctrine that we should main
tain friendly relations with all nations, but
enter, Into entangling alliances with none, are
even stronger to-day than they were a hundred
years ago. Our commerce is rapi'dly Increas
ing, and we are brought into constant commu
nication with all parts of the world. Even It
we deslrod to do so, we could not afford to
alienate many nations by cultivating unneces
sary intimacy with a few. Our strength and
standing are such that It Is Ies3 necessary than
ever before to lean for aid ution the friendli
ness of a forelen power.
We cannot connect ourselves with European
nations and share in their Jealousies and am
bitions without losing the peculiar advantage,
which our location, our cnaracter and our in
stitutions give us in the world's affairs.
The Monroe Doctrine.
The doctrine enunciated by Monroe, and ap
proved by succeeding Presidents, is essential
to the welfare of the United States. The con
tinents of North and South America are dedi
cated to the development of free government.
One republic after another has been established,
until to-day the monarchical idea has barely a
foothold in the new world.
While it Is not the policy of this country to
Interfere where amicable relations exist be
tween European countries and their dependen
cies In America, our people would look with
disfavor upon any attempt on the part of Eu
ropean governments to nÂ»alntaln an unwilling
or forcible sovereignty over the people living
on this side of the Atlantic.
The position taken by the Republican leaders,
and more recently set forth by the Republican
candidate for the Presidency, viz., that We can
not protect a nation from outside interference
without exercising sovereignty over Its people*
is an assault upon the Monroe doctrine, for,
while this argument is at this time directed
against the proposition to give to the Fllipinoe
both independence and protection. It is equally
applicable to the republics of Central and South
America. If this Government cannot lend its
strength to another republic without making
subjects of Us people, then we must either
withdraw our protection trom tne republics to
the south of us or absorb them. Under the
same plea, that the guardian nation must ex
ert an authority equal to its responsibility, Eu
ropean, nations have for -centuries exploited
their wards, and it j is a Menifleant fact that
the Republican party should accept the Euro
pean-idea of a protectorate at the same time
that it adopts a European colonial policy. There
Is no excuse for this abandonment of the Amer
ican idea. We have maintained the Monroe
doctrine for three-quarters or a century. The
expense to us has been practically nothing:, but
the protection 'has been beyond value to our
sister republics. If a Filipino republic is
erected upon the ruins of Spanish tyranny, its
protection by. us .will be neither difficult nor
expensive. No European nation would be wlll-
Intr for any other European nation to have the
islands, neither would any European nation be
willing to provoke a* war with us In order to
obtain possession of the islands. If we assert
soverelKnty over the Filipinos we will have
to defend that sovereignty by force, and the
Filipinos -will be our enemies: if we protect
them from outside interference they will de
fend themselves and will be our friends. If
they show as much determination In opposing
the sovereignty of other nations as they have

Successful Benefit in the Mechanics' Pavilion,
Where AH Labored Cheerfully to.*SweIl
the Fund for Galveston Sufferers.
SIXTEEN hundred people flocked to the Pavilion last evening, and while seeing and applauding an excellent ath
letic programme, helped the Galveston fund out to the tune of several hundred dollars. The 1600 who attended
do not represent the number that bought tickets, so it will be to-day or to-morrow before, the exact amount
the exhibition netted the fund will be known. "Whatever sum It be. It Is all clear profit, for everything was do
nated. The hall was given by the Mechanics" Institute, the First Regiment Band proffered its services free of
charge, the doorkeepers worked for nothing, the ushers were Olympic Club members, the apparatus was from the
Olympic Club, the talent was from the Olympic and other clubs, besides some professionals: the affair was given un
der the auspices of the Olympic Club and WiJllam Greer Harrison, president of the Olympic Club, and John Ham
mersmith, Its leader, had charge of the programme. It was a grand success.
The programme opened with an overture by the band. Then George Meihllnp brought out twenty-five of his
juvenile class and put them through foot evolutions and calisthenics. They were roundly applauded.
The leaplng-board was then rigged and for ten minutes athletes chased each other down the runaway like a game
of follow-my-le&der." The leapers were J. O'Connor, H..Gray, W. W. Claweon, H. Manor, "\V. Cavanaugh, J. Bevans, E.
Stack, W. Sheehan, R. Moll, F. Real. L. Liebman, H. Bragers, C. Olsen, E. Miller, J. Rand, Professor R. Leando and
Howard and Campbell. H. W. Schretber then gave a very pretty exhibition of club swinging, and this was followed by
a very short exhibition of double trapeze work, by Howard and Campbell, which was brought to a close by the fall of
one of the performers. With chairs the floor was then divided off. Into "rings" and the boxers were turned loose, four
pairs at a time, and for a while blows were thick and fast and there was plenty of fun at the expense of the glad
iators. The boxers were: W. J. Ltonard and D. Carroll: J. Rock and F. McConnell; J. Splro and F. Burgers; C. Mill
ward and J. F. McCarthy; J. Britt and F. Bayley; the Frane brothers and Martin and Johnnie, the champion Juvenile
boxers. A brother act by H. Bragers, C. Olsen and E. Miller followed the boxing.
A. M. Stone, with the help of several sugar barrels and two tables, gave an exhibition of barrel jumping, first free,
then with his feet tied, and then with his feet tied and his <=ycs blindfolded. The members of the Verelh Elntracht fol
lowed with a number of pyramids that were freely applauded. A twenty-five yard dash with Irwln, Cutter Kav
anaugh, Roberts, Manor, and Gerhardt, was the next event, a short one', for Uerhardt won in something over three
seconds. R. Moll and J, Rand then did some clever work on the triple horizontal bars and Trilby Fowler followed
them with some trick bicycle riding, winding up with a burhrque on the beginner and ending his act with a somer
sault over the hanulebars onto one of the mats, and E. Kehrlein gave a very clever of fenc'ng with foils,
and Professor Tronchet and his best pupil. Emlllo Lastreto, followed with a bout with duelling swords. Members of
the San Francisco Turn Verein then took the floor for an exhibition on the parallel bars, and then the programme devel
oped into a composite tournament of everything that was to come.
Irwln and Cutter took to the pole vault, and it was announced that they had cleared the bar at 10 feet 6 Inchesâ a
coast record, it was announced, if It had been under proper conditions. The wrestling pad was hauled out, and while
the jumpers were at work close at hand the wrestlers strained and tugged at each other for public approval. The wres
tlers were: J. A. Mackenzie and C. D. Pentony; F. Bayley and J. Splro; E. Murphy and F. Hogan; W. King and George
Hensley: J. Jenkins and M. WllwarJ.
And while the rest was going on four tug-of-war teamsâ one from the Cement Workers' Union, one from the lock
ed-out mlllmen, a third from the derrick men and a fourth announced as the "Irish" teamâ pulled at a rope amid the
plaudits of the crowd. First the cement workers and the millmen strove, and the cement workers pulled the mill
men across the cleats and to defeat. Then the Irishmen did the same for the derrickmen, and then the cement workers
and the Irishmen met. By this tirade excitement ran high, nor was it lessened when the Irishmen started the cement
workers homeward and pulled them over.' That ended the evening's programme.

Rapidly Progressing,
GALVESTON, Sent. ITâ The work o:
clearing thr Ftreots of dt-bris and
wrtckaje is progressing steadily
and v.ith systematic rapidity. The
military anthorltfefl have gradually
perfected iho py^tein anJ divided the la

Interruption or delay. The report* filed
at General Scurry** beadQuarters up to ti
o'clock to-jiighi roportod the recovery
nnd dippositicjn of l>\it forty-five bodies
during the day. The Now? reporter, how
ever, noted the linoir.-r: Â«.f 130 bodies oi
men. women and children.
Health Officer Wilkinson stated to-day
that 40 per ccr.t of the debris of every de
scription had been removed from the
streets; that SO per cent of the dead
bodies had been disposed of, ami H3 jKÂ»r
cent of tin- c.-ircaJses of animals had been
removed from the city. Hut as the work
of removing the debris s^es on more
bodies are beinr^ unearthed every hour.
There is stiil iin Immense amount *oi
Â¦work to be clone In this respect and in
fcome quarters hardly an impression has
been made on the mountains of wrfckagt
piled up !ift<-^n or twenty feet high.
A hopeful feature of the situation is tho
rapid progress being made by the rail
roads in their efforts 'to restore rail com

RECOVERING BODIES
FROM THE WRECKAGE
NEW ORLEANS. Sept I7.-A special
from Galveston says: The ninth day after
the storm, and still the gruesome work
goes on of recovering the dead from the
gigantic mass of debris that lines the
touih side of what remains of the city.
"Yesterday 1U7 bodies were recovered and
cremated. The task of recovering the
bodies that are beneath or jammed into
the immense rick of debris, extending
from The t-ahtern to the western limits of
iho city, a distance of over three miles.
1* a herculean one, and the most exyedi- ;
Ileus way of removing the whole, from a
(sanitary point of view. Is by fire. This, :
however, in the crippled condition of the !
lire cK-puTiment and waterworks would I
endanger the remaining portion of the >
city.
As it rjr.Â«v stands this immense mass of !
debris, strewn bodies, the carcasses of j
decaying animals, etc., is a sore menace i
to the health of the city, ami is the most j
difficult problem the Board of Health has !
to deal with.
The work of opening the streets and
disinfecting them is being vigorously pros- ;
Â«*cuted. Tne debris and garbage is being j
removed. SO'J vehicles of every description j
carrying it out to a t-afe place, whrrc it is
burned, and in a few days all streets will ;
l)e opened for th<Â» passage of vehicle?. The j
Â¦work of relief of the sick and Injured is Â¦
well in hand, a:id under the direction of j
skilled physicians and nurses is Improving j
daily.
The â¢narinÂ» hospital service, which is
â¢working in conjunction wit'i the Board of ;
Health, has oytablish<^J a hospital on the
beach at the foot of Trtmont 6treet,
where the sick and wounded, now she!- Â¦
tered In unsanitary pfaicei throughout tho â¢
city, will be taken for treatment, whetlier j
tli jy w:sh to so or not.
The revenue cutter Winona. from MvÂ»- '.
bile, arrived to-day and Captain Parry
placed the cutter at the disposal of the \
lioard of H^.-jlth for the removal of the j
Kirk and wounded who are able to leave j
the city for interior points.
Sickness of a malarial type is becoming 1
prevalent among the sufferers, ar.d appre- j
reunion La Mt ;::at it may assume a more '
serious form.

zation as far as the State lines. Cir
culars were sert out to ev.ry
Mayor, every chairman of every
county Board of Supervisors, every
Sheriff and the editor of every
newspaper, informing them of the or
ganization of the committee and asking
that they organize themselves, if they
have not already done so, and in any case
to report their progress to the State
committee so that an accurate record of
the amount subscribed by the State may
be kept. The State committee does not
wish to hamper any movement already on
toot, nor to dictate in any way how or
when money should be sent, ttut it does
wish, in addition to securing all the
money possible, to keep an accurate ac
count po that the well Known generosity
of California can be once more proved to
its fullest extent.

will be announced to-morrow.
The morning meeting was called to or
der at 9 o'clock by Bishop Hamilton. Dr.
Robert Bentley, presiding elder of tho
Sacramento district, the largest district
In point of territory In the entire confer
ence, was called for and presented the
report of work carried forward in his dis
trict during the past year. Marked im
provement in all lines of church work
was shown, especially among the young
men of Fome portions of the district.
This is the last time a report of this dis
trict as a whole will be presented to this
conference, for it is one of those to un
dergo a readjustment and possibly a dlvi-,
slon.
Several visitors were presented to the
members of this conference. They were:
H. P. MaGlll. agent for the Methodist
Insurance concern; Professor Milton S.
Vail of Janan. Albert L: Hazlett of Ne
vada and Dr. W. S. Mathews of I^cs An

tary, as a testimonial of thanks and es
teem for his longr and faithful work aa

conference of Dr. Bovard's work in Chl
natov.-n during the quarantine. Dr. Bo
vard having had himself inoculated with
the plague serum In order to act as in
termediary between the Chinese and the
Health Board. Dr.. Bovard received round
after round of applause for his heroism.
Dr. James M. King of Philadelphia was
then presented and addressed the body
briefly on the work of the M. E. Church
Extension Society, of which he is Ameri
can secretary.
The final report 1 - of presiding elders
was that, of Dr. F. D. Bovarfl, who has
had charge .of the Chinese district since
the death of Dr. F.. J. Masters In February
last. The report showed the splendid con
dition of affairs throughout the district
ar.d a high tribute was paid by Dr. Bo

"who." he said, "literally gave his life
for the Chinese." lie spoke of the great
love and respect in which the Chinese

being that it would be defeated. Two
hundred and sixty dollars was raised to
carry on the campaign.
A tremendous sensation was produced
by the report of the committee on tem
perance, presented by Dr. John A. B. Wil
son of San Francisco. It contained among
others a resolution pledging the confer
ence not to support any political party
not having an anti-liquor plank in its
platform, and to support only an abso
lutely prohibition party. A stormy argu
ment resulted on the point that the ques
tions involved were purely political and
committed the members of the body to
vote for John G. "Woolley and his entire
ticket. Dr. Wilson finally withdrew the
resolutions.
One notable action of tho morning waa
the adoption by a unanimous vote of reso
lutions offering the sympathy of this con
ference to Dr. and Mrs. David Starr Jor

THE BISHOP ANT> PRESIDING ELJ5ERS OF THE CALIFORNIA METHODIST CONFERENCE "WHICH IS NOW
BRINGING TO A CLOSE AT PACIFIC GROVE- AN ANNUAL SESSION FRAUGHT WITH ACTION OF IM
PORTANCE TO THE WELFARE OF THE CHURCH.
"T met several moneyed men wanting to
buy claims and they told mo that they
could find none for sale. The Bluestone
district adjacent to Nome has been show
ing up very rich. Good reports were be
insr received from the Golovan Bav dis
trict also. The Wild Goose Railway,
which runs from Nome nine miles back
into the Interior, is doing a gTeat busi
ness. Its rolling stock consists of an en
gine and four freight cars, and this train
makes three trips daily. Great crowds
are coming- and going all the time. The
road is to be extended to Fort Clarence
and the BluÂ«Â«tone district, a distance of
eighty milps."
"Although many Nome claims have
been tied up in receivership litigation
and the country has been suffering from
a severe drought, the season's gold out
put will be not less than $3,000,000 and
may reach $5,000,000. The camp is now
do\*n to a working 1 basis. Most of the
surplus population has moved on and fully
ten thousand people are preparing- to
spend the winter there. The claim that
the beach diggings are worked out Is un
true. When I was there over 1500 men
were digging gold from the Nome beaches
and they were taking out from $10 to $25 a
dav to the man.
The stampede to the Bluestone country
gains proportions daily. A dozen steam
craft have been put on the run from nome
to Port Clarence and are carrying crowds
of passengers on every' trip. All reports
from the new digging? are of the most
glowing description. Claims are held at
high figures and offers to purchase are
far in excess of owners to iÂ»eil.
James D. Hoge Jr.. president of the
First National Bank of this city, returned
on the Valencia. He says:
The steam craft In Nome harbor or
which had temporarily put to sea when
the Valencia sailed were the Roanoke.
the Charles D. LÂ»ane, the Sequoia, the
Charles Nelson, the J. S. Kimball. the
Alliance, the revenue cutter McCulloch,
the Oregon, the Thrasher, the Dora, the
Discovery and the barg-e Spokane.
Two deaths recently occurred in Nome
from natural causesâ those of Joseph B.
Billings, a New Yorker, whose familv re
side at 803 MePharian street, Flint, Mich.;
and Paul Kolatsch.
The disaster to the lighterage business
is likely to prove serious. It is said that
every lighter owned by the North Amer
ican Transportation and Trading Coir
pany was ground to pieces. The Alaska
Exploration Company," the Alaska Com
mercial Company and the Seattle-Yukon
Company were also heavy losers.
In Nome harbor the storm had raged
four days when the Valencia left. Hun
dreds of lighters were driven ashore and
the beach was strewn with wreckage- All
the large craft in the harbor had to put
out to :<ea to avoid stranding. The Valen
cia's officers heard that there were six
persons known to have been drowned and
three others were missing: but communi
cation with the shore was uncertain and
every one was looking out for himself and
his own ship, so no one on board learned
the names of those drowned or any of the
facts of the accidents.
SEATTLE. Sept. 17.â In the face of one
of the worst etorms ever experienced off

The final decision on this claim will af
fect the State to the extent of millions of
dollars. As the special attorney for Sac
ramento County. Attorney Gett in 1892
collected $20,000 from the State from the
same source of appropriation. â¢
It Is very likely that the State Board of
Examiners will reject the claim. If such
action be taken by the board, mandamus
proceedings will be instituted against its
members, and the matter be thus brought
to an issue.
The several counties of the State have
whenever the occasion arose paid money
for the support of these persons, and sub
sequently received from the State the
rame amount of monev in return. It has
been the rule of the State Board of Ex
aminers in allowing claims of this char
acter to pay to the several counties the
exact amount that it has cost them to
support and maintain these wards of the
State. The attorney of Contra Costa
claims, however, that that county Is enti
tled to the full sum of $100. or $75. as the
case may be, for each orphan., half or
phan or abandoned child that it has sup
ported and maintained. Since the pas
sage of the act of 1SS0 the State has paid
to Contra. Costa County $17,519 86, while
the county claims that there was due $31,
034 84, which leaves a balance of $13,514 98.
for the payment of which the claim is
presented.
SACRAMENTO. Sept. 17.â There was

Other members of the committee
thought Jones or Stone ought to have got
that subscription so the party might have
had the benefit of the whole amount.
The committee expected to get $25,000
from John R. McLean, but McLean is In
Europe and it is understood that they
have nothing from the Ohio leader as yet
except a promise and that promise calls
for not much over one-fifth of the amount
expected.

have signified their, friendship for Bryan.
Almost without exception overtures of

these disappointments Democratic man

O. H. P. Belmont was looked upon as
certain to give at least $100,000. All he
would give was $13,00o and the committee's
agent who secured that subscription held

This 10 per cent commission business
has caused a good deal of dissatisfaction
among members of the Democratic party
who are disposed to criticise what they
call Chairman Jones' "amateurish" meth

Chairman Jones turned "Buck" Henrlch

TESTIMONY IN
HOWARD CASE
The Pietermarltzburtr correspondent of
the Daily Mall announces that Lord Rob
erts will start for England about October
3. This time there is little doubt of the
genuineness of the report of his early re
turn. Some troops will also be coming
back, and the elections will thus be ex
cellently timed by the Government to
take advantage of the national fervor
over a successful war. The proposed
visit of the Duke and Duchess of York *o
Australia also arouses much enthusiasm.
The Daily Chronicle jjvvs: "Lord Salis
bury, as ho always does, has yielded to
the stronjr man. He has stifled con
science, thrown scruples and justice to
the winds and succumbed to Mr. Cham
berlain, who is now the ruler of the Pre
mier and the country."
The Standard announces that after the
elections there will certainly be a recon
struction of the Cabinet. This probably
means that Lord Lansdowne, Secretary
of State for War, and one or two others
will be sacrificed.
For the moment dissolution is a more
attractive thing than China. The Con
servative, organs are confident that thÂ«
"khaki Issue" will give- them an increased
majority and they are naturally jubilant.
The Liberal and Radical organs, on the
otht-r hand, conscious that they are fight
ing a losing battle, bitterly denounce the
Government for choosing the present
time to dissolve.

One hundred thousand soldiers In idleness!
Think of these words being spoken by a candi
date for the hlshest office In the sift of the
American people, of the men who have passed
a year of jSuch grinding toll and desperate
fiRhtlnjt in the Philippines that we here can
form no conception of all that they have dared
and risked and endured. They have been
worn down month In and month out, march
ing from dawn until darkness through the mud
of the tropical swamps, sleeping when and how
they could, eatlnsr what they could get or
toins without, facing: death by bullet at every
step from a foe ten times as, numerous as
themselves, and, if wounded and left .behind,
facing what was infinitely worse than 'deathâ
the most dreadful torture. With what patient,
uncomplaining, unflinching, never-wearying
courage they have done all this, and have ms.de
not only America but all mankind their
ors; and their reward Is that the chosen rep
resentative of one ' of the two great parties
sneere at them as walking about in idleness.
Some of them no longer walk about in idle
ness. I.awtnn no longer walks about In Idle
ness. L.!scum no longer walks about In idle
ness. Reilly no longer walks about In idle
ness. Many an officer, many a soldier rests
forever in peace â peace because his life of toll
and effort for his country has come to the kind
of end which should at least secure freedom
from slight or slander both* for the valiant dead
and for the no less valiant living. One soldier
do the work of these men! Are our memor
ies so short as already to forget the hurry
with which we drew. troops both from America
and the Philippines when the blood of- our
people called from China and the awful dan
ger of the women and children in Peking stirred
to its utmost soul the manhood of Christendom.
Small, indeed, la the chance for idleness for
our soldiers In the Philippines so long as 'the
Insurgents are aidod and abetted by one of the
great parties in this country. Every American
who holds high honor of. his country should
graven on his heart the solemn prophecy of
Lawton. Let him bÂ«ware above all else of
the words that speed the bullet* of our coun
try's enemies. Â¦â¢Â£Â¦, t â¢
During the day short stops were made
at . Bozeman. Manhattan, â¢ Logan, Town
tend and Winston, at most of which flve
mlnute talks were' made by Governor
Roosevelt or some of the party.
This extract contains such an extraordinary
variety cf misconceptions tliat it seems dif
ficult to believe It can be a correct renort .If
correct, however. It is Interesting In the first
place to se that Mr. liryan has abandoned the
Kansas City platform and his own message of
acceptance In so far as they define the kind
of danger arising from our militarism. The
absurdity of speaking of an army of 100.W0
m*?n aÂ« b. threat to the country, when one
third of them are volunteers and the rest regu
lars provided for only two years by Congrese,
Is so palpable that the mere statement of the
case is sufficient for the refutation. But it
is no more absuni than the extraordinary posi
tions taken In Â¦ the foresrolng quotation. What"
in it that bodes no Rood to American Institu
tions? Is it the. sixty-odd thousand regulars
for the most part in the Philippines? Mr.
Bryan oucht to know by this time that in
asmuch as Thomas Jefferson handed over to
his successor an army which he had increased
uutll it represented 1.4 of a soldier for every
thousand of population. an:l as no damage to
our institutions followed, , there is ecant room
for apprehension on the part of even the most
timid soul from the existence now of an army
of etsht-tenths for every thousand of popu
lation. Under President McKinley, while there
is war in the Philippines, our regular army has
shrunk to little more than half the size It had
attained at the end of President Jefferson's
administration during a period of profound
peace.
Even more extraordinary is the statement
that the 100.000 soldiers are permitted to walk
about in Idleness where one soldier would do.
If It were not for Mr. Ilryan's other utterances
on the subject It would seem absolutely im
possible that this statement could have been
correctly reported.
In a recent speech at Chicago, Mr. Bryan is
represented to have SDoken as follows: "Can
100 000 soldiers in a country like this take
charge and change the form of government?
No. But th*> tact that a people like ours per
mit this bodea no good to American institu
tions. If K'0,000 are permitted to walk about
in Idleness where one soldier would do, what
are we coming to?"
Two meetings were held here this even
fngâOHe a t the Auditorium and the sec

The tyro who attempted to write a farce

or herself on the fact that the name of
the author was not printed on the play

The farce has many funny" things In it,
but they are diluted as though the author
was paid by the pa*re. The last act would
be funny if cut in two and the audience

LAST niglit at the Columbia
Theater Mr. Clement presented a
curtain-raiser (evidently adapted
from the Frtnch) by Dion Bouci
cault. entitled, "Xapol eon's Guard." The
programme announced that the ver
sion ?iven was "rearranged by Mr. Clem
ent." Alas! Why did he not leave it
alone? "
In Mr. Clement's version all the char
acters are absolutely required by the ac
tion to be French. How comes it. then,
that one of them has a purely English
title, being- called ".Lord" Beauville? And
would a French "lord" be likely to have
an English secretary named Rawson?
And, again. If all the characters are
French, why do three of them speak
English without a foreign accent, one
with a French accent and one with a
German accent? They should surely all
speak correct English or correct French.
May we <lare to stultify the plain
intention of the author and pay that only
the French and German accent characters
are French, while the English-accent
characters are.Kng-Hsh? Jf fo, how can a
French corporal, Haversac, be the loyal
subordinate of a defunct Ensrlish g'eneral.
brother to the villain. "Lord" Beauville?
The brain reels at the contemplation of
this racial paradox.
Mr. Clement is a good actor, but no ac
tor, however good, can make credible
such a mass of incredibilities as this.
The sooner he. drops it from his reper
toire the better.
Compared with "Napoleon's Guard."
"The lieils." that followed, is a compact,
well-knit playâ and this, too, in spite of
Its gauze curtain apparitions, its long
soliloquies, its absurd mesmerism and its
feeble attempts at comedy. The Interest,
of course, lies chiefly in the dream scene
of the third act. This Mr. Clement plays
with all necessary fervor, yet without
rant. He certainly pets a thrilling ef
fect out of it â If this thrill Is physical,
rather than spiritual. Well, we cannot all
be born Trvimrs and it is well that there
be diversity of gifts.
As to the support. It Is no uncruel klnd
nesn to remind some of them that correct
pronunciation and passable elocution are
arts that should be mastered before gcing

- The members of the Board of Educa
tion made a round of visits to the various*
schools of the city, yesterday to ascertain
for themselves whether or not the classes
which Superintendent "Webster says are
overcrowded need reclasslflcatlon.
'â¢President Mark said last night that the
inspectfon had resulted in the formation
of a new class in the Grant Primary.
Principals of other schools visited de
clared themselves satisfied with the pres
ent-classification and no further changes
were made. In the case of the Grant the
new class will be formed of the overflow
from the third and fourth grades.
' Contrary to expectation, the classifica
tion of the Pacific Helnhts School will
remain unchanged. Tlie average enroll
ment there is heavy, fftty-three being the
number of pupils in most of the classes,
but as the principal is satisfied the board
has decided to take no action.
..."As to who will take charge of the new
class x I am not yet prepared to state,
said Mark last evening. "Of course we
Shall be guided by the priority rule. \Ve
shall not. however, appoint an incompe
tent teacher merely because her name
happens to come first on the .list. Should
the principal of the school have any
worthy objection to our choice we may
skip two or even three names to get an
efficient Individual. The matter will be
decided at the next meeting of the
board."
At the Pacific Heights School three
pupils", are unprovided with desk room.
These will be accommodated.
â¢Other schools visited were the Emerson
Primary, Everett Grammar, Dudley Stone

that there Is ample accommodation in ill
these schools, and that principals declare

hearty encores last night and the songs of

style. Paul La Croix, a novelty juggler,
performed some surprising feats and Pearl

Jessie Bartlett Davis is still the bright
particular star at the Orpheum, and last
night she was recalled again and again
and smilingly complied. The songs she
rendered gave full scope to the' flexibility
and volume of her magnificent voice. The
most charming of the five was possibly
"Because I Love You So," which was
rendered Â¦with an archness and sweetness
that were irresistible. Her last was the
ever-welcome "O, Promise lie." Among
the newcomers the Johnston brothers es
tablished themselves as favorites Their
playing on the xylophone is .splendid.

Faust himself has not often received a
more gracious rendering, than was accord
ed the part last night in the hands of
Barron Berthald, and a notable feature of
its success was the fine blending In tho
tonÂ© quality of the voices of Faust and
Marguerita. Signor Salasaa received an
cvation on his appearance as Valentine.
Nlcolini's Mephisto was very good in
places. His voice, however, is hardly of
sufficient depth and his work as regards
rhythm is often very apparently careless.
Wagner was satisfactorily sustained by
Signor Napoleoni. and a sood word must
also be said for the chorus and orchestra
Anna Lichten ig certainly more happily
suited in the rolo of Marguerite than in
anything else she. has done â¢ this season.
Her "King cf Thule" and the -Jewel
Song" were admirably sung and charm
ingly acted. Frances Graham adds an
other to her growing list of successes as
Slebel. Miss Eleanor Josephs, in a mag
nificent gown, as Martha, .filled the part
very satisfactorily.
There Is an especially happy cast for
the opera In ,thls representation, which,
doubtlees, accounts for a larger propor

conceded all around that the opera watf
given Jn perhaps more fully satisfactory
shape than anything that has yet been

CAIilFORNIANS IN WASHINGTON
Since the time that report was issued there has not
been much in the way of fighting. The -Boers no
longer: hold their positions with the valor and skill
and resolution displayed in the early days of the war.
It is evident most of them have lost hope of victory
and arc fighting now solely because they cannot
bring their minds to submit to the hated yoke. Not
withstanding the lack of fierce fighting, however, the
British will still lose a good many men before peace
is established. ; Empire, it will be seen, is costly.
The new province has cost the empire dear. Offi
cial returns from London gave the list of deaths
among the British forces down to August 25 as fol-
Killed in action... 2SS0
Died of wounds gll
Died of disease â¢. 53^
Died of captivity gg .
Accidental deaths. .: 91
Total deaths.... 9231
In addition to the dead there were at the time the
report was made 2833 men who were either prisoners
in the hands of the Boers or missing. The soldiers
sent home as invalids numbered 27,309, raising the
official statement of the casualties for the British army
to the monstrous, total of 40,561. This, be it rcmeni"
bered, makes no mention of the sick and Wounded
soldiers in the hospitals throughout South Africa,
who probably range in number between 15,000 and
20,000 men. ,
THE COST OF A PROVINCE.
PUBLIC interest in the war in South Africa has
well nigh ceaseJ. There are no longer any bat
tles to be fought there, and the world does not
care to follow the dreary story of the pursuit of feeble
and scattered bands of desperate patriots by the va
rious troops of Lord Roberts' victorious army. When
the general elections ?re called for in Great Britain,
and the Salisbury Ministry has to submit to the voters
a declaration of the policy it proposes to pursue in
dealing with the conquered, 'there will be again a
world-wide interest in the issue, for all intelligent
people will watch to see how much of magnanimity
and how much of despotism the British will exhibit
dealing with their fallen foes. For the present, how
ever, the subject is about closed.
.The temerity with which lawyers are ready to risk
being in contempt of our local courts suggests that
contempt of court is frequently justified.
CREDIT belongs to President McKinley for put
ting into a single terse phrase the fact that
whatever issue the Bryanites may call "para
mount" in this campaign, the preservation of the gold
EiandLrd is "the immediate issue," and equal credit is
dfe to Senator Hanna for setting forth in a statement
equally terse that the chief feature of the so-callei
"paramount issue" is the hypocrisy of Bryan with re
gard to it.
Speaking of the relation of Bryan to the Philip
pine treaty, Senator Hanna in a speech on Saturday
evening al Delphi, Ind., told how, at a gathering of
representative Republicans in Boston, Senator Hoar
characterized Bryan's action and announced his judg
ment tpen it. The dispatches report Senator Hanna
to have said:
That grand old man arose and. laboring under the
solemnityâ and, as he thought, the Importance â of that
occasion, felt that he had been almost estranged from
his party and from his President, and yet. strong under
his own convictions that had rooted within him In a
lifetime, he saidi "Gentlemen, you all know that 1 have
not been in harmony with my party upon this Philip
pine question: but that is only one of the many im
portant questions, and as long as my party stands upon
the foundation, the principles of which were the be
ginning and baptism of its life, I shall stand by my
party. But." he said, "I propose to tear the mask from
the face of that hypocrite, William J. Bryan. I call
him a hypocrite because, like my friends Senator Lodge
and Senator Hanna, I know the motive which inspired
the action on his part to ratify the treaty. You told
me then, but I could hardly believe It was true, and
I now see that it was true, and that he Is acting
the part of a consummate hypocrite in all his advocacy
of the opposition to the President on that occasion."
Commenting upon the statement of the venerable
Senator from Masachusetts, the orator went on to
sav: "I repeat it here and I will repeat it from every
rostrum where I have the opportunity, that the ac
tion of Mr. Bryan and those who" are following him
in this contest on this Philippine question has been
ere of hypocrisy and' deceit from the beginning and
will continue so to be to the end."
There is no exaggeration of politics in that state
ment. For years Bryan has declared that his chief
object in politics is the overthrow of the gold stand
ard. He persisted in that declaration down .to the
meeting" of the Kansas City /convention. The astute
politicians of Tammany Hall who attended that con
vention, being aware that to make the campaign on
the silver question would medn an overwhelming de
feat, naÂ«aged to have "imperialism" declared the
"paramount issue," and Bryan, who-had urged the rati
fication of the Philippine treaty, fromptly adopted the

CRITICISM OF MAYOR
PHELAN'S ORATORICAL
MISAPPROPRIATION
THE CALL has won a significant victory for the
teachers in the local School Department by
compelling from the Board of Education a con
cession that instructors shall be advanced and reas
signed according to the priority of their service. Dur
ing the administration of the present board a gross
evil has been fostered. In the star chamber proceed
ings in which the bourd delights teachers of long
Standing were virtually thrown out of the department
by being degraded to the unassigned roll without pay.
Favorites were not only advanced without merit, but
v.tre actually smuggled into the department in the
most approved style of the political schemer. Under
the mask of consolidation opportunity was given to
provide for these favorite?. Under the convenient fic
tion of a principal's recommendation a new avenue of
dishonesty was opened in the system.
The Call exposed this evil, and now President Mark
gives an assurance that it will no longer be an ele
ment of the administration of the board of which he
is president. Notwithstanding this promise President
Mark is already seeking to evade the course which ex
perience has demonstrated to be just. He says that
while priority of service will govern advancement, the
recommendations of principals will also be material
factors in determining the action of the board.
This means simply that the prevailing and dishonest
Â»cherne of favoritism is not to be completely destroyed
by the board. A principal's recommendation, under
the present board, has meant nothing more or le^s
than the coercion of the board upon a principal to ask
for a teacher whom she does not know and had no
opportunity of knowing. A vacancy happens, for ex
ample, in a certain school. The principal may know
only one of the teachers who are available to fii! the
vacancy. Those whom she does not know are the
oretically and, very probably, practically as efficient as
the one she knows. But her acquaintance with a par-.
ticular teacher is accepted by the Board of Education
as the qualification most essential for advancement.
Instructors who have known longer service must
vsit unassigned or make the acquaintance of eve-y
principal in even' school in San Francisco or seek the
favor of a politician with a pull. This is the evil which
ends in demoralization and scandal. It is the evil of
favoritism, which The C?H exposed. It is the evil
tvhich President Mark promises to eliminate from the
School Department. Under the theory of the local
school system experience is the criterion of efficiency
and its proof is priority of service. If in obeying this
established rr.le of the department the board commit
error, the remedy fixed by statute and which the board
has not been sJow to accept lies in the accusation, trial
2nd dismissal of teachers found to be inefficiem.
President Mark should remember that favoritism is
ro safeguard except to those who possess no other
qualification for advancement.

It appears that one of the readers of the Exam
iner has a friend from Berlin who does not believe in
the immortality of the soul, and the reader, being
greatly distressed thereat, wrote to the Examiner to
say: "You could very much oblige me by telling me
something I could say to him." Thereupon the yel
low journal proceeded to instruct the reader to tell
the Berlin atheist, first, that Bismarck believed in a
future life; and. second, that a caterpillar has no
more right to turn into a butterfly than a man has to
turn into an angel. It closed with this sage advice:
"Say to your friend: 'Hans, you are only a caterpil
lar, not a .philosopher, and so don't bother me any
more.'" Then it adds: "Calling him a caterpillar
will annoy him and leave him without an answer."
It will be seen the method is simple. Call Roose
velt a cowboy and it will annoy him and leave him
without an answer. The defect of the method is it
is so easily learned that even wise men may be
tempted to use it in answering a fool according to
his folly; so let the retort go â the Examiner is a
caterpillar.
By way of evading an assertion of sincerity or a
confession of insincerity as to silver, the Examiner
hastened to Roosevelt's argument on the Philippine
question, and referred mockingly to what it called
"the cowboy standard." Such a method of meeting
an" opponent's arguments will not appear satisfactory
to the public, but the Examiner thinks it will pass.
In fact, in an editorial immediately following the one
on the Roosevelt letter it gives an explanation of its
style of argument, and the explanation is sufficiently
curious to be interesting.
Had the Examiner icad Roosevelt's letter it would
have found there this statement: "When our oppo
nents champion free silver at 16 to i they are either
ir.iincere or sinccre'in their attitude. If insincere in
their championship ihcy of. course forfeit all right to
belief or support on any ground. If sincere, then
they are a menace to the country." That is the way
the people look at it.
If that mean anything at all it means that the free
coinage pf silver is no longer a live issue; that it is
as dead as Ptolemaic astronomy. If such be the case,
however, why did the Kansas City convention re
affirm and reiterate the silver plank of the Chicago
convention? Why did Bryan seek and obtain the
nomination of the convention of silver men? Why
did Towne of Minnesota, who is a Republican on
every issue except that of money, withdraw from the
Populist ticket in order that Bryan might be better
?b!e fo make the tight for sjlvcr? Why does Senator
Teller of. Colorado and many another silver Repub
lican support Bryan?
CALLING HIM A CATERPILLAR.
WHEN reviewing Roosevelt's letter of accept
ance yesterday the Examiner said: "Governor
Roosevelt is vÂ»;ry sure that we ought not to
have the free coinage of silver. It is believed, al
though space was lacking to dwell upon it, that he is
equally opposed to the Ptolemaic system of astron
omy, the Virginia and Kentucky resolutions and the
Lecompton constitution of Kansas."
The telephone monopoly must be scheming some
new imposition upon the public. The company, with

There is no. other man in the country who is re
garded as more typically American than Roosevelt.
Certainly there is none in public life who knows all tfo
United States more thoroughly or has a more com
prehensive sympathy with all. classes of its people. He
is a university man who spent several years of his life
as a cowboy; a Northern statesman who when the
war broke out went to the front as a leader of Rough
Riders drawn from the Southwestern plains. He
know? Montana and Texas as well as New York and
Massachusetts, and is a true American to the core.
His letter will find a. responsive welcome everywhere,
and there will be many an old-fashioned Democrat
who will be moved by it to repudiate Bryan and all
that Bryan stands for and vote for McKinley and
Roosevelt.
Concerning the problems involved in the regulation
of trusts Mr. Roosevelt says: "There are real abuse >
and there is ample reason for striving to remedy tho>e
r.bu?es. * * * The first thing to do is to find out
the facts, and for this purpose publicity as to capitali
zation, profits and all else of importance to the public
:s a most useful measure.'' He adds: "Much may
be done by taxation. Even more can be done by
regulation?, by close supervision and the unsparing
excision of all unhealthy, destructive and anti-social
elements. The separate State governments can do a
preat deal, and where they decline to co-operate the
National Government must step in."
The remainder cjf the letter deals with the issue 1 
r.ri?ing out of the war with Spain and the insincerity
of the Brj'anites in shouting against "imperialism"
and "militarism" is exposed. As Mr. Roosevelt
say?: "The words rncrn absolutely nothing as ap
jlied to our policj' in the Philippines. * * * Our
army is relatively not so large as it was in the days
of Wayne; we have not one regular for every 1000
inhabitants. There is no more danger of a draft than
there is of the rcintrodr.ction of slavery."
. Since it is not so much a contest between Repub
licans and Democrats as between the friends of good
government at home and abroad and the supporters
ol a policy of disaster, it is fitting that the points in
controversy should, be emphatically stated for the in
struction of the voters. Mr. Roosevelt has done that
in the following words: "Fundamentally and prima
rily the present contest is a contest for the continuance
of the conditions which have told in favor of our
material welfare and of our civil and political integ
rity. If this nation is to retain its well-being or its
self-respect it cannot afford to plunge into financial
and economic chaos: it cannot afford to indorse
governmental theories which would unsettle the stan
dard of national honesty and destroy the integrity of
our system of justice. The policy of the free coinage
of silver at a ratio of 16 to 1 is a policy fraught with
destruction to every home in the land. It means -un
told misery to the head of every household, and.
above all, to the women and children of every home."
With a characteristic justice of statement Roose
velt says: "I feel that the contest is by no means
one merely between Republicans and Democrats. We
have a right to appeal to all good citzens who are
far-sighted enough to see what the honor and the in
terest of the nation demand." In view of the fact
that so many eminent Democrats who have been
among the most stalwart of their party in times past
have in this contest declared for the Republican nomi
nees, the accuracy of that statement cannot be suc
cessfully disputed. A great host of far-seeing Demo
crats who have an intelligent appreciation of the in
terests and the honor of the republic will support
McKinlcy this year as firmly as the sound money
Democrats supported him four years ago, and it was a
graceful act on the part of Roosevelt to make a pub
lic recognition of their patriotism.
GOVERNOR ROOSEVELT in accepting the
Republican nomination" for the -Vice Presi
dency has presented the country with one of
the clearest and strongest statements of the issues at
stake which has yet been made. All the vigor and
verve which are characteristic of the man are mani
fest in the letter. Thcie is'not a weak sentence in it.
No important issue of the time is ignored or evaded,
nor is anything intruded which distracts attention
from the main questions before the people. As a cam
paign document it will be widely read and will prove
one of the most effective of the year.
ROOSEVELT'S ACCEPTANCE.
During the campaign of 1896 Bryan by his specious
promises and direful predictions of what would hap
pen if silver were not remonetized managed to fool
;Â¦ good many of the people. Since that year, how
ever, the course of events and the advancement of
prosperity have refuted all his prophecies and made
his promises valueless. He cannot fool -the people
?gain, not even by trying a new trick. The campaign
of hypocrisy will end for Bryan even more disas
trously than the campaign of debt repudiation" four
years ago.
The hypocrisy of Bryan in the campaign has been
further shown by his refusal to say whether, if elected
to the Presidency, he would pay in silver all the
Government obligations which are not specifically
payable in gold. Upon that question he will neither
say yea nor nay; and yet it is but a short time ago
since he went about declaring the establishment of the
gold standard "the crime of modern times," and em
phatically announcing that if elected President he
would get rid of it as quickly as he could.
new cry. He had himself helped to prepare the way
for it. He had long foreseen the need of some kind
of mask to wear in the East while waging his second
tattle against gold and with the raw cunning of an
unscrupulous demagogue was quick to find that mask
in the problems which the war with Spain have left
for the people of this country to solve.

The loss of her child had broken Mrs. Mur
ray's home, and under these circumstances the
desire to go to her mother was a natural and
reasonable one. In spite of the fact that Â»he
knew she mlnht not be altogether welcome, in
truth that ehe might anger and offend her
mother. From her testimony it would seem
that the treatment riven her by thÂ» decedent
was about what *he had expected. But It
wculd seem also that after the surprise and
annoyance her appearance caused had passed,
she was treated with kindness and considera
tion. '.:.'':.
I am satisfied that Mrs. Murray has proved
her residence as required by the statute. The
application of | the Public Administrator Is
hence denied and the application of Klla F.
Murray is granted and letters of administra
tion upon the estate of Almira S. Townsend
will Issue as prayed.
Mrs. Murray's bonds were fixed at
$675,000.
The evidence shows that for more than thirty
years Mrs. Murray was a resident of Dorches
ter â¢nd during part of that time her husband
having died, lived alone with her daughter.
During the years 1?92 and l&M she visited her
mother In sL Francisco and wain "turned to
Dorchester. â¢ Some time in April of this year
her daughtcr-an only child-died and on thÂ«
5th of July following she came direct to San
Francisco, where *he arrived nearly two weeks
before her mother's death, since which time
stated amon*
other reasons that a letter from Thomas T.
Townsend led her to believe that after long
separation he had determined to annoy his
former wife, the petitioner's mother, and she
concluded that Mrs. Townsend needed her
assistance, "for she knew of the terrible
treatment her mother had received and tne
several other wives that he had." ,-Â¦Â¦â¢
Mrs Murray further said that when she
left Dorchester she was very determined to
come .to this city to live for the rest of her
life The actual condition of Mrs. Murray,
after her daughter's death, would furnish a
sufficient motive for a change of residence and
elves color to the positive statements made by
her regarding her intention to take up a resi
dence in California.
While it iÂ» true that the deceased willfully
and designedly separated herself from her
daughter during most of the years of her life,
she was not insensible to the relationship exist
ing between them nor forKetful of the duties
li imposed, all of which is shown in the ex
pressions of love and sympathy contained In
the correspondence that paused between thÂ«m
after the death of her grandch'ld. for whom
she seemed to have had a deep affection.
Public Administrator Boland has met
defeat in his effort to secure, control of
the estate of the late Almira S. Townsend.
Judge Dunne handed down an opinion
vesterday and so far as the Superior
Court is concerned ended the controversy
between Mrs. Ella F. Murray tdecedent s
daughter) and the Public AÂ«*m ntetrator.
Ella F. Murray was declared a legal resi
dent of this city and county, adjudged
legally competent to administer upon the
estate of her deceased mother and was
awarded letters in accordance wUh the
prayer of her petition.
In his opinion Judge Dunne says.
Judge Carroll Cook will go to Santa
Rosa this morning and occupy the Super
ior bench of that county, and Judge Bur
nett will come to this city and try the
Peter McGlade case, which will be called

Noteâ This study, bv Dr. J. A. Wood
burn of Indiana University, will be con
cluded on Tuesday next.
Fremont, with thirty-nine men. after
traversing a region of 1700 miles, reached
the Great Salt Lake. His account did
much to correct erroneous ideas ot the>
region, and It promoted the setuement oi
Utah and the Pacific States. It was prob
ably his report that gave the Mormons
their first idea of Utah as a place of ref
uge and residence. From Salt LJike Fre
mont pressed on to the Columbia and Fort
Vancouver, where he was the guest of Dr.
MacLaughlin, the president of the Hud
son Bay Company. Fremont chose as the
direetion of his return a southeastern
route through the heart of an unknown
region from the lower Columbia to thÂ»
upper Colorado that flows into the Gulf
of California. The maps of the time rep
resented a river in tne middle of this
region, flowlnc from east to west from
the base of the Rockies to the Bay of San
Franciscoâ the River Buena Ventura.
MacLaughlin and Fremont both believed
in this river, and Fremont planned to
reach its rich bottoms before winter set
In. He started on hl3 perilous journey;
he skirted vast ridges of mountains; deep
snow Impeded his progress and drove him
from the highlands Into the Great Basin,
and he found â not the River Buena Ven
tura, but a great desert â and here he fcunil
himself, in the dead of winter, face to
face with death from cold and starvation.
He learned from his astronomical obser
vations that he waa in the latitude of San
Francisco, and that that haven was but
seventy miles away. But to traverse
those seventy miles meant to cross snow
capped mountains that, the Indians told
him. no man could cross in winter. No re
ward could induce an Indian to become
his guide on such a perilous venture. Fre
mont determined to attempt the passage
without a guide. It was r.ccompUsherl in
forty days, "the men and surviving
horses, a woeful procession, crawling
Along, one by one, skeleton men leading
skeleton horses, arriving at Sutter'a
camp in the Sacramento Valley, where
the party rested and recruited."
Fremont's report of this expedition at
tracted wide attention, and in the fol
lowing year he set out on another, de
termined to explore the middle region be
tween the Rockies and the Pacific, fur
ther to promote geographical knowledgo
and discovery. Thomas H. Benton is un
willinR to attribute the expeditions of
Fremont to the "zeal of the Government
for the promotion of science." Govern
ment may have the merit of merely per
mitting the first, but it was not wholly
passive as to the second. Benton relates
that when young Fremont left St. Louis
for the frontier Mrs. Fremont (Barton's
daughter) was requested to examine the
letters that came after him and to "for
ward those that he ought to have." Mrs.
Fremont received countermanding orders
for her husband and detained them, and,
Fremont "knew nothing of their exist
ence until he had returned from one of
the most marvelous and eventful expedi
tions of modern times."
John C. Fremont, whoso exploits rained
for him the title of the "American Path
finder." In 1S42 Lieutenant Fremont was
instructed by the War Department to
take charge of an expedition for the ex
ploration of the Rocky Mountains. The
object was to examine and report upon
the rivers and country between the fron
tiers of Missouri and the base of the
mountains, and especially to learn more
of the south pass, the great crossing
place to these mountains on the way to
Oregon. Fremont reached the pass with
in fouf months, which he describes as "a.
wide and low depression of the moun
tains where the ascent is as easy as that
of the hill on which the Capitol stands,
and where a plainly beaten wagon rued
leads to the Oregon through the valley
of Lewis River, a fork of the Columbia.
With four of his men Fremont climbed
one of the loftiest peaks of the Rockies,
which has since borne his name, whencs
he "looked down on ice and snow aomo
thousand feet below and traced In the
distance the valleys of the rivers which,
taking their rise in the same elevated
ridge, flow in opposite directions to thÂ»
Pacific Ocean and to the Mississippi."
Lewis and Clark.
"We acquired Louisiana in 1SC3. Jeffer
son was President. At that time prac- ;
tically nothing was known of the vast i
region from the mouth of the Missouri to
the mouth of the Columbia, The geog
raphy of the region -was a matter of the
Imagination, and a few widely scattered ,
Indian trading posts were the only visible â¢
marks of civilization. In 1S03 the act for
establishing these trading houses with the
Indians being about to expire, Jefferson
In a special message proposed some modi
fications of the act to Congress. The mes- ,
sage proposed the sending of an expedition
to trace the Missouri to Its source, to cross
the Rocky Mountains and to follow the
best water communication to the sea.
Congress voted a fum of money for car
rying Jefferson's suggestions into execu
tion. Captain Meriwether Lewis solicited
and obtained the direction of the enter
prise. Jefferson in his "Memoir of Letts'.'
says of the explorer: *
1 had had an opportunity of knowing him
intimately. Of courace undaunted, possessing
a firmness and perseverance of purpose which
nothlnc but lm:>osslblHtte9 could divert from
Its direction; careful as a father of those com
mitted to his charge, yet steady in tha main
tenance oÂ£ order and discipline; Intimate with
the Indian character, customs anU principles;
hab.tuated to the hunting life; honest, dis
interested, liberal; of sound understanding and
a fidelity to truth so scrupulous that whatever
he should report would be aÂ» certain as II seen
by ourselvesâ with all these qualifications hs
If selected and Implanted by nature In one
body fcr this express purpose I could have
no hesitation in confldine the enterprise to
him.
Three octavo volumes are devoted to the
story of the journey of Lewis and Clark.
From May, 1801. to September. 1S06. thÂ°y
traversed the plains and mountains to the
Columbia, noting the natural features ct
the- region, the mouths of its rivers, its
falls, rapids, islands, portages, the mode
of Indian life, the Indian tribes, their lan
guages, their food, their laws and the'r
customs. The unimals and minerals, the
flowers and the physical features of the
country were also scientifically noticed
and described. They passed the Mansan
villages, near Bismarck, up the Missouri,
across Dakota, across Montana to thj |
present site of Gallatln, to the headwater.;
of the Salmon Hiver, where they slaked
their thirst for the first time In the
springs whose waters flow to the Pacific;
thence to the Snake and the Columbia,
where they saw "the waves like small
mountains rolling out In the sea."
While this expedition was in progress
Cclonel Zebulon Montgomery Pike (born
in New Jersey, 1779 â died In 1813> was ap
pointed to trace the Mississippi to its
source. He performed this service within
nine months, after much exposure to peril
and hardship. Pike spent the winter of
1S05-6 among the Indians and agents of
the Northwestern Fur Company on the
Upper Mississippi, and in the spring of
1800 ha traced that river to its source. In
the same year Pike engaged in geographi
cal explorations of the southern part of
th- Louisiana purchase. He went up the
Osagc. across the Indian Territory, trav
ersed Kansas, measured the height of the
great peak in Colorado that now bears
his name, turned south to the Arkansas
and after untold sufferings from cold and
snow and hunger he came out on the
waters of the Rio Grande. Here, in Mexi
can territory, he was captured by the
forces of the Spanish Governor and car
ried to Santa Fe. After his release he
came home by the longer but safer south
ern route through Texas.
These two great explorers, Lewis ana
Pike, both died In the prime of early
manhood. Pike, at 34. was killed In 1313
by a magazine explosion while still in the
active military service of his country in
the war of 1812. Lewis, at 35, after his
appointment as Governor of Louisiana,
met a mvsterious death, by stiicide or
murder, in a frontier cabin in Tennessee
in 1S09. :

THE EXPLORERS OF THE GREAT WEST.
The Grande Duchesse
Olga Loses Her
Spars.
DISASTER OVERTAKES TWO
SHIPS IN THE DOLDRUMS
The City of Papeete Is
Wrecked on a Reef
Off Tahiti.
FULL particulars of the disasters to
the. American barkentine City of
Papeete and the French bark
Grande Duchesse Olga were
brought by the brig Galilee, which ar
rived from Tahiti yesterday.
The Galilee herself did not escape un
scathed, but came into port with her
maintopmast gone. While in the dol
drums U1.30 north, 137.30 west) a sudden
squall struck her and had the Galilee not
been a particularly stanch vessel every
thing would have gone by the board.
Captain Dlnsmore of the Galilee, in re
porting the various disasters, says:
"The Grande Duchesse Olga left San
Francisco on April 30 with 81.642 centals of
wheat, valued at over $60,000. Down in
the doldrums the winds are more erratic
than i have ever seen them. A sudden
squall caught the Grande Duchess* Olga
and took the foretopmast out of her,
while a similar squall a month later took
the maintopmast out of the Galilee. The
Grande Duchesse Olga. reached Papeete
on July 12 and she had considerable
trouble in reaching the inner harbor. She
was in port when we left, as Captain
Maheo was awaiting instructions from
.France. A new mast and new running
gear will have to be sent out and it will
bo months before the Grande Duchesse
Olga can resume her vo>age.
"ihe City ot .fapeete arrived from San
Francisco early in June, having maue
the run down in twenty-five ua>s. tine
was uetainea in quarantine because of
the buoonic plague btare and none of her
crew was allowed asnore. The cargo was
got on the whurf alter a great deal ot
uilticulty ana men the barKentlne pre
pared to tail again. Captain Lund, wno
was In cnarge, Captain Berude having
succeeded In getting ashore, got his ves
sel under way Juiy I at 3 p. m. Wocause
of the bubonic plague scare a pilot wouiil
not go aboard tne vessel, but one accom
panied her out In a small boat. Tne or
uers may have been misunderstood, but in
any event the City of Papeete went on
the reef.
"The barkentino remained on the reef
for over twenty hours, and as she was
pounding all tne time the strain on th<Â±
null was terrible. She was nnaiiy got off
and towed back to Papeete by the tug
Eva. On ller return she was held in quar
antine again tor twenty-four days and
then the crew was allowed to go ashore.
"An examination of the City of Papeete
showed that nearly all the knees ami
beams were sprung. A diver went down
and reported ihat the keel had gone the
whole length flush with the garboard and
that the keel bolts had started up through
the keelson all the way from three to six
inches each. When we left Papeete the
intention was, as near as I could gather,
to patch up the Papeete and send her to
Auckland, New Zealand, where she would
be permanently repaired. From there
she would bring a general cargo to San
Francisco or else go the Newcastle, Aus
tralia, and load coal for here."
When the Galilee v.as In port the French
cruiser Protet was also there. She was
being coaled under rush orders to go to
China, however, and was to sail the day
after the Galilee.
Which Tug Will WinP
The question along the front Is whether
Spreckels" new tug. the Louis Lucken
bach. or the L'niteu States transport tug
Slocum will reach San Francisco first.
The Siocum is an ocean-going vessel ut
237 ton* burden, while the Luckenbach is
1ZS tons net. The Slocum lett New York
en July 9, while the Luckenbach left
Philadelphia on August 4. From last re
ports the Luckenbach was at Rio de
Janeiro on August 31, while the Slocum
sailed from Pcrnambuco on August 2.
Pernarcuboc is 1075 miles from Klo de
Janeiro, so from that it would appear as
though both tugs were holding their own.
Still many people on the front seem to
think that it will be a tie race or else
the Luckenbach will win out. Captain
McCoy, superintendent of the Spreckels
Towboat Company, is in command of the
Luckenbach and that means a good deal
in the vessel's favor.
Walla Walla Arrives.
Captain Thomas and the crew of the
Queen brought the steamer Walla Walla
from Puget Sound. The vessel was in
quarantine at Victoria, ii. C, a case of
smallpox having broken out while the
mail beat was on her way north. All the
passengers and crew were transferred to
I another vessel by the British Columbia
i authorities and then the steamer was so
thoroughly fumigated that it will take
several thousand dollars to repair the
damages.
When the steamer arrived here yester
day Dr. Kinyoun was not satisfied with
her bill of health and he held her in the
stream for several hours.
The intention is to get the vessel away
to-night. In consequence a large force of
men awaited the arrival of the vessel at
the wharf and no sooner was she along
: side than the work of unloading began.
There was about 3000 tans of cargo to take
out and 1100 tons to put in. All this stuff
must be got out of the way by Wednes
day, as the Umatilla is due early on that
morning. She brings a big cargo and the
wharf will have to be clear to receive It.
'Longeshoremen will have night and day
work at Broadway for the next week.
Wisconsin Takes a Spin.
The battleship Wisconsin took a short
spin around the/ hay yesterday. Her
compasses were tested and the engineers
saw to It that everything was In good
working order. Another run around the
bay will be made to-morrow and on
Thursday the Wisconsin will sail for
Puget Sound On her arrival there she
will be placed on the Port Orford dry
dock and after a thorough overhauling
.will have her trial trip. -After the trial
she will come back to San Francisco and
go into commission.
Relics of Ancient Days.
"While the tug Sea King was laying
some buoys at Arch Rock yesterday Cap
tain Rasmussen made a queer find. While
taking up some kedges. an anchor, hawse
pipe and thirty fathoms of chain came to
the surface. The anchor is one of the
old-fashioned type and Captain Gray of
the "Red Stack Company things it be
longed to the old ship Autocrat that was
wrecked on Arch Rock thirty years ago.
Old-timers think the blowing up of Arch
Rock will bring some more relics of old
time wrecks to light before the rock is
blown up.
He Wanted a Drink.
A man, who would not give his name.
Jumped . overboard from Union-street
wharf yesterday. No one made any at
tempt to save him and he finally con
cluded to save himself. He swam to a
pile and then Wharfinger Arnerich hauled
him to the wharf.
"You're a mean crowd anyhow." Â¦ was
the comment of the would-be suicide. "If
vou'd taken me to the hospital they'd
have punjped me out and then given me
| a drink of whisky. The whisky is what
I was after."
The resignation of Mr. Howard removes
from the business world of San Kran<is
co one of its oldest and most active mem
bers. For two decades he has been an
able manager of the immense interests ol
the company in this city. During the war
with Spain Mr. Howard secured Govern
ment contracts calling for thousands of
tons of coal, handling the contracts to the
entire satisfaction of the officials.
J. D. Farrell. president of the company.
arrived last nipht from Sratt'.o on thf
Walla Walla; tn<i to-day will appoint Mr.
Howard's succt-ssor. For business rea
koiis Mr. Farrcll declined giving the name
of the prospective manager, but it is more
than probable the billet will be secured Dy
an employe of the company, ma'y of
wh<-,m ha\'e been connected with the coal
tr^e on this coast for years.
irominent among those mentioned for
the vacant managership is Robert Hus-
Iinnd. who h;is been in the office <-t the
company for a number of years. When
seen la?t night Mr. Husband would not
fay anything concerning the selection of
the new manager.
John L. Howard, for the past nineteen
rears Ken.fra.1 manager of the Pacific
Coast Company, coal doalÂ«Â»rs and iniport
' rs. yesterday tendered his resignation.
Mr. Howard still retains his interests in
the company, Flmply retiring from active
participation in management of the af
fair? of the concern.
President Farrell Arrives From Seat

In prices of stocks failed to occur to-day. There

In prices as that of Saturday, but the friends
at the various stocks had placed supporting
criers In Their market and their buying was
RUfficlent to absorb the offerings. The pro

rsot slow to detect the evidences of eupport and
they hf.rrened >o cover and take their pront!=.

in the recovery. Eeelnx the tendency of things,

account was taken of the fact that last wÂ«k'i

CHICAGO, Sept. 17.â Save for a moment of
uneasiness at the start, when traders were feel
ing the disappointment, over the advance of
only Hd at Liverpool. In the face of the bulge
here Saturday, wheat was buoyant. The mar
ket made further gains in spite of Liverpool
and in spite of an increase in the world's ship
ments and in the amount on passage. The de
mand was general and broader than usual be
cause of predictions of more rain for the
Northwest. October opened H@9Â«c lower at 76
@i6ttc and under liberal pressure from buy
ers advanced to 77%@77%c. The visible increase
of 2,191,000 bushels put a wet blanket on the
market. Influencing considerable profit-taking
by longs. The close, however, waa strong, Oc
tober after reacting to 76Â»ic, steadied and
closed Â»io over Saturday at ll%c.
Corn was dull and Inclined to weakness Oc
tober closed %c lower at 38>4c.
Oats were dull. October closed a shade down
at 21?ic.
Provision* again felt the pressure from shorts
who were on the trail of pork and ribs. Lani
was supported by the light stock of that prod
uct. Lard and ribs both held their gains well,
but when the short Interest In pork had become
apparently satisfied that speculative article
eased off. October pork closed 2H@5c higher

721 Howard street. .Last Saturday night the number of reg- .
lstered voters in San Francisco was. 56,702.
It is figured at the headquarters of the
Republican State Central Committee that
18,000 voters are unregistered, hence vig
orous efforts will be put forward to in
duce every voter who has neglected to
re-register for the coming election to per
form the duty of registering at once. No
doubt voters who were properly on the
register at the last election and have not
since changed their places of residence |
think reregistratlon Is not necessary, but
the fact remains that the law iequlres
every voter to reregister for the general
election in November of this year.
In order to awaken business men to a
sense of their duty letters have been
mailed to the heads of mercantile and
manufacturing establishments so that em
ployers may afford employes every facility
to register. Following Is a copy of letter*
sent yesterday:
Dear Sir: Registration closes on "Wednesday,
September 26. Will you kindly Interest your
self and make It your business to urge upon
every Republican in your neighborhood to regis
ter once? The registration office at the City
Hall is open from 8:30 a. m. to 10 p. m. Devote
a little time to this. It is necessary to achieve
success. Respectfully.
, GEORGE STONE, Chairman.
W. M. CUTTER. Secretary.
Active and systematic work upon the
part of Republicans should result in the
enrollment of 18.000 additional names on
the register. The efforts, however, should
not be relaxed until every Republican
voter Is registered.
Campaign oratory is also engaging the
attention of the State Committee. Gov
ernor Gage will enter the .field as a
speaker. He will speak in San Francl3co.
San Jose, Fresno. Los Angeles, Sacra

out the battleship Wisconsin Tor two
weeks. When that duty Is performed he
will be ready to take the platform for
McKlnley and Roosevelt. Joseph Camp
bell is on the list of orators and will speak
under the auspices of the State Commit
tee.
D. E. McKinlay spoke at Yreka last
night. He will address the people of Sia
sons to-night. He will Journey down the

J. A. Barham and Judson Brusie will

The Democrats are preparing to send a
host of orators to the front. The cam
paign will be opened in every county seat
next Saturday night. The big event oi
the opening will be the meeting at the
Mechanics' Pavilion In this city. Exten
sive preparations have been made to give
a great reception to Charles A. Towne.
There will be music, campaign songs and
fireworks.
In response to a notice sent out by John
R. Hlllman. flrst vice chairman of the Re
publican County Committee, a conference
of anti-boss Republicans was held at
Bhiels Hall last evening. Twenty-five
'delegates to the convention, together with
members of the committee of eighteen,
composed the conference.
The meeting was executive, but the
statement was freely made at the ad
journment that the topics discussed re
lated to the permanent organization of
the convention. It was the sense of the
conference that the convention had been
discredited by the election of a temporary
chairman chosen by Martin Kelly. The
sentiment was expressed that Bergerot
was so Identified with Crimmins and
Kelly that the great mass of Republican
citizens would have no respect for or con
fidence in a convention over which he
presided, therefore it was advocated that
reorganization be demanded. Reference
was made to the committee on credentials,
which Bergerot appointed after consulta
tion with Kelly, Crimmins, Burns, Lynch,
Goldberg and Dibble. A review of the list
showed that the committee was composed
of eleven boss and four anti-boss dele
gates.
There will be another conference at
Shlels Hall to-morrow night. Every dele-
Clean Republicans Resolve They
â¢ Will Spurn Schemes of Com
promise With Bosses.
gate opposed to boss rule Is Invited to
attend. There is no doubt that the caucus
will take steps to select a chairman other
than Bergerot. It is clearly understood
that the Republicans of San Francisco
will spurn nominations made by a boss
convention. If the delegates fall to re
pudiate the bosses, the voters will repu
diate the ticket put forward by the con
vention. It was said frankly last night
that the convention should be absolutely
anti-boss or openly a boss-controlled body.
In ev*ry district of San Francisco the
good citizens of Republican faith are ad
vocating an open walk-out if the conven
tion is not wrested from boss control.
The strength of the anti-boss element in
the convention will be determined by the
caucus to-morrow night. The vote cast
for Kelly and Crlmmlns candidates was
reported at 105, but it Is now known that
Kelly's men In voting under the unit rula
made improper announcement. Votes cast
for James A. "Wilson under the unit rulo
were not tallied as Bouvler ordered the
roll called. A fair showing of strength
will not give Kelly and Crimmins 105
votes. This fact is known and commented
upon by delegates who are anxious to or
ganize the convention In a manner cred
itable to the Republican party
BERGEROT ISSUES HIS
LIST OF COMMITTEES
Republican Convention Chairman
Asks That Members Purge Them
selves of Partisan Peelings.
P. A. Bergerot, temporary chairman of
the Republican County Convention, haa
Issued his list of committee appointments.
Chairman Rergerot declares that the

tion and that they were chosen after con
sultation with various members of the
two factions which participated in the
temporary organization of the conven
tion, with a view to secure harmony and
a better understanding In the party In
the Interest of Republican success. He
also asks that the members of the com
mittee on credentials divest themselves
of all feelings of partisan or factional
strife and to be guided In the discharge
of their functions solely by a dealre to
bring unity of action and purpose in the
convention as a whole.

Neighbors came quickly to the rescue
and the sufferers were carried to tho
"Webbers near by. Drs. H. 8. Kergan and
W. W. Kergan were summoned. The fire
men came, but the house waa gutted be
fore the flames were quenched. Mrs. Klier
was unconscious and at* times very
flighty. She was very badly burned about
the face, head. neck, limbs and body. Her
condition is critical. The police have
taken charge of the caae and detectives
are looking for the burglars.
Mrs. KHer had been out to a neighbor's
house and left -her three children up
stairs In bed at home. She returned at
7:30 o'clock and found the whole hous..
upset. Screaming she ran out crying that
the place had been robbed. She discov
ered that her jewelry was gone. X rear
window opening Into a dining-room had
been forced open and the burglars entered
i.iat way. It is supposed they were
frightened off by Mrs. Klier's return and
dropped a bit of lighted candle In a cor
ner where it smoldered for three hours.
About 10 o'clock Mrs. KHer smelled smoke
while she was Hitting upstairs writing to
her husband. She opened a door leading
to a back stairway, and a~ burst of llama
drove her back. The frightened woman
rushed for her children, and. grabbing
them, tried to fcrce her way downstairs
but the fire waa blazing high and drove
her back, burning all of the helpless ones
severely. Then the mother rushed to tho
front window, threw out a mattress and
dropped her babies, one by one. to the
ground twenty-five feet below her. She
then Jumped herself, but not until her
clothing was afire.
The flames swept upon them so quickly
that despite her spartan act. thÂ© mother
and her children were badly burned, an-l
Tlllle besides had her right arm broken.
Worst of all the flames that Imperiled
these lives and destroyed the dwelling are
believed to have been started by burg
lars, who, a short time before the fire
broke out. had entered the house, ani
after ransacking it, stole a gold watch,
rings and all other valuables the family
possessed. To add to the misery, the hus

Professor Bacon closed by speaking of
the growth of college spirit in the Univer

1 he men at work in the fields are being
kept under close surveillance for fear of
further such outrages. While most of the
workers are honest men, many hard char
acters manage to obtain employment, and
it is difficult to weed them out.
Coughlin has no clew to his assailants
and dues not know whether the assault
was prompted by motives of robbery or
revenge. He is badly ufcI up as a result
of his encounj.tr, and is inclined to think
that he was set upon in the dark by
friends of Miller, who wanted to revenge
themselves upon him for the part he took
In the capture of the murderer.
"I waa making my regular rounds," said
Coughlin to-day, "when 1 heard soft foot
falls behind me. The next instant I was
struck on the back of the head with some
blunt instrument. Being stunned by the
blow, I fell to the ground. How long I
remained there I don't know, ikit when I
came to no one was in sight. My watch
and pistol were gone, however. I had no
means of identifying the men, as it was
pitch dark at the time. They may have
been friends of Miller."

Coughlin, the aped watchman who, after
a desperate duel in the dark last Satur

murderer of Janu-s McFarland. was bru
taJly assaulted last night while making
his rounds of the Pleasanton Hopyards
Company's premises. He was knocked

he lay unconscious his gold watch, pistol

AROUND hundred of all sorts of
male humans posed In the "alto
gether" before the Police Commis
sioners and Chief of Police Sullivan
and eight doctors in the old wheelmen's
room of the Olympic Club last night. All
these hundred men who submitted to
poking- and pinching and "Does that
hurt?"' accompanied by digs in the ribs,
aspire to some day wear a star.
Drs. Artlgues, M. Herzsteln, J. C
Hirschfe'.der. E. C. Kelly. P. S. Palmer'
Georpe H. Powers, "W. F. Southard and
G. M. Terrill were nil on hand, armed
with all kinds of instruments to test a
man's fitness to be a "cop." Deputy
clerks from the Recorder's and the Coun
ty Clerk's office stood around, "clothed in
a little brief authority," and held up
astonishing charts which none of the ap
plicants could make head or tail of.
Off In the corner of tho room the ap
plicants stripped and then gave them
selves over to the tender mercies of the
examiners. Hardly had a candidate
stepped off the weighing machine when a
piece of steel hit him on the top of the
head. He turned to remonstrate and bo
held a smilinp clerk taking his height.
Then Dr. McNutt came up and soon the
aspirant, by this time shivering with cold
and nervousness, was told he could go.
One little item on the application blank
stayed many an otherwise would-be "cop"
from putting in an appearance. It read:
"If the waist measure exceeds that of tho
chest applicant will be rejected."
At last night's examination Police Com
missioners Mahoney, Newhall and McNutt
were present. Edward Moran of the civil
service acted as chief examiner, and had
a busy time of It. There are 300 applicants
for positions on the police force and they
will be physically examined In squads.
The crucial test, however, will come on
October 3, when the ambitious have to
pass a written examination, this being
the final test. Many a man who passed
muster last night will fall down woefully
on that day. and those Â¦whose â¢waists were
tried and found smaller than their chests
may weep for "what might have been."

Miss Jennie M. Heaton's claims to the
estate of her alleged father, the late War
ren D. Heaton. were heard to-day by
Judge Greene, before whom she appeared
In support of her petition for letters of
administration. The hearing lasted all
day. most of the testimony being that of
witnesses produced by Miss Heaton In
an attempt to prove that she is the law
ful child and next of kin of the late
capitalist.
A number of persona who had known
Heaton in Placer County before his first
marriage had been summoned. The testi
mony of all bore out In substance the al
legations of Jennie M- Heaton that Â»he is
Warren D- Heaton's daughter. The
stories told by the up-country witnesses
all bore traces of what was evidently
lonK ago a choice morsel for the gosslpa
of the little town of Lincoln. Placer
C Mrs t . y Matilda Hodgklns If Lincoln, an
ola and Intimate friend of the Heaton
family, told the court of the gossip cre
ated by the attentions of Warren D.
Heaton to Mrs. Mary May. a widow re
siding near town. Mrs. May. she said,
afterward became Heaton s wife. airs.
Hodgkins knew of the existence of the
caild Jennie, and always heard Heaton
acknowledge her as his own. -- Â¦'-.-Â»
Charles Gibson, who drove a butcher
wagon at Lincoln about the time that
Jennie Heaton was born, described his
visits to the May ranch with supplies.
He first saw Jennie Heaton when she was
about a year and a half old. This was
at the May ranch.
"One day while talking with Heaton."
said thÂ« witness. "I Jokingly asked him
about the little tfirl. I asked him if she
was his child. He answered, "She is my
daughter. I recognize her as my child.'
I saw the little one many times after
this n.nd Heaton always acknowledged her
as his daughter."
Another witness who knew Heaton at
Lincoln a number of years agp was Dr.
H. J. Plomteaux, now of this city. Dr.
Plomteaux often heard Heaton declare
Jennie to be his daughter. He did not
know who her mother was.
"Mr. Heaton and his first wife, who was
Mrs. May. always treated Jennie as their
daughter." concluded the witness.
Jennie M. Keaton was examined In her
own behalf. She could not remember
where she was born or the date. The
first place she remembered was Wheat
land. Placer County. Said she:
"Mr. Heaton always called me hlÂ»
child. I was raised by his first wife.
whom I always called mother. After his
second marriage my stepmother and her
daughter made things so disagreeable for
me that I was forced to leave .home. I
was always Introduced by Mr. Heaton as
'my daughter Jennie/ "
The hearing was continued until Friday.

Dawson to Skagway, Alaska, by
BICYCLE ICE TRIP.
Bicycle.
E. P. Leroy, a newspaper correspon-
dent, was the' first or.e to make a trip
successfully from Dawson to Slogway
( 550 miics) over the ice on a bicycle.
He was eight days on the way and en-
rr.untercd one of the heaviest sno.v-
Â¦ rms of the reason. He comments on
the universal fact that men in the Arc-
lic climate have scurvy and stomach
trouble because of poorly cooked food.
He says when he fir=t went to Alaska
he had a pood stomach, but it finally
gave out. and one day in his search for
fotnethins: that a man withotit an appe-
tite conW eat he came across some pack-
i^cs of Grape-Xuts food. He knew of
the food and its value and was willing
to pay quarter of an ounce of cold dust
C$4 oo) for one package.
He says: "I can assure you the satis-
faction of getting something I could cat
and Ripest without Euflerinir was well
worth the price. As soon as it ha<l
proven to be just what I wanted I
bought the whole lot, and from that dav
to this Grape-Xuts food has constituted
mv chief article of diet.
""I find that Grapc-Xuts is miicklv
picked tin as soon as a new lot comes to
camp. There is r.othirijr known that
rjvcs the miner and frontiersman the
strengths v.ith so . little volume, as
Grape-Nuts food, and it is always rcadv

test Hied by the sailing master. W. \V.
Tomlinson, of the sloop Amigo against the
sloop Presto for one alleged foul In the
annual regatta resailed on Sunday.
Mr. Tomlinson testified that after cross
ing the starting line and while on the
Ftarboard tack he observed the Presto on
the port tack in s-uch dangerous proximity
that he hailed her and expected that her
helmsman would puC her about. This was
not done, however, and, to avoid a colli
sion, the Amlgo was luffed, and In order
to weather the stakeboat nearest the
Â¦wharf was compelled to come about on
the port tack. Even then the Amigo nar
rowly missed entangling her bowsprit In
the topping-Hft of the Presto.
Frank Stone, owner and sailing master
of the sloop Presto, testified that he had
to pay off to get round the Btern of tho
ploop Aeolus; then he sighted the Amlgo
and came about to give her the right of
way. He also said that at no time was
the Presto less than thirty feet from the
Amlgo.

did score of 73 on the honorary targec;
W. R. Hyatt and E. Schmidt of Sacra
mento; L. C. Babin, T. J. Carroll. F.
Haumgarten, A. Strecker, Captain At

On the members' target, where each

Mason made the highest score ever made
in the club, his score being 73. Hagerup.
en the same target, made 71.
At noon the shooters sat down to a
banquet in the dining hall at the park,
with Philo Jacoby at the head of th*
table. Speechmaking was indulged In by
every one and the visiting marksmen anil
the old-time champions were cheered to
the echo. During the flow of oratory the
history of the California Schuetzen Club
was told. In the course of his address
Mr. Jacoby said:
"In 1S75 the Centennial Commissioners
sent an invitation to this State for marks
men to go to Philadelphia and enter the
lists for the world's championship honors.
Twenty-one teams from all over the world
were entered. Seven of us marksmen, de
siring to uphold California's reputation,
came together and decided to Journey to
Philadelphia. Provided with a mascot In
the shape of a large carved and gilded
bear, emblematic of our State, we entered
the contest and won, beating, every team
competing. The old guard that won that
victory is now getting along In yeara.
Time, however, is dealing kindly Â¦with us.
Of the seven men of that team four of
us are now presentâ A. Strecker. A. Rah
wyler. William Ehrenpfort and myself.
"The California Schuetzen Club was
founded at that time. To-day it is one
of the stanchest shooting clubs in the
world, with a great membership and with
no indebtedness."
The team that competed and won at
the Centennial in 1876 was composed of
Philo Jacoby, A. Strecker, A. Rahwyler,
W. Koenlg, W. Srenly. A. Bauer, W.
Ehfenpfort and Captain Grelner, who was
a substitute.
The total scores will be ready for publi
cation to-morrow.
The second and last day of the Califor

of animals is one of the "show's features.
To-morrow morning at 10 o'clock the vast
hippodrome will start along the line of
march from the ground at Sixteenth and
Folsom streets.
The route will be over tho following
streets: Folsom to Sixteenth, to Howard,
to Second, to Market, to Montgomery, to

The initial performance will be given to

What is commonly considered one of the
most remarkable feats ever accomplished
In the training of horses Is that achieved
by John O'Brien. He handles sixty-one
horses so that they move In unison at the
simple word of command, and form the
pyramid which Is pictorially set forth in
the colored posters that decorate the bill
boards of the city. . x
These anmals are beautiful specimens of
their kind, well bred, shapely and keenly
Intelligent.
Mr. O'Brien is rather a plain-looking and
decidedly modest man. There. are no airs
about him, and he is known to all the cir
cus people as "plain John O'Brien." It is
hard to picture in words the effect of this
beautiful act by the sixty-one horses.
There are five platforms, one above the
other, arranged in the form of a pyramid.
The apex of this pyramid is a magnifi
cent animal, upon which Mr. O'Brien sits
and directs the arrangement of the other
sixty horses. There are fifteen horses In
each set, and at the word of command
they go through many pretty maneuvers.

Eâ MILE P. SOMPS. one of the best
known young business men in San
__ Francisco, died yesterday, after a
lingering illness, at the home of his
father. Pierre G. Somps, 253G Mission
street.
The young man was extremely popular
around town and had hosts of friends. In
assisting his father in the sodawater busi
ness he became a familiar figure around
the streets. About three months ago he
contracted a bad cold, and though re
quested by his parents to take a rest and
travel for his health he refused to relin
quish his work. He was stricken with
galloping consumption and for the past
two months had been confined to his bed.
The deceased was an only child and 27
years of age.
During the famous Currant trial Emlle
Somps was an important witness for the
prosecution, as he was one of the oincers
who discovered the body, of Blanche La
; tnont In the belfry of the church.
For the past seventeen years Mr. White
has been employed on the morning news
papers and won a name for being a con
scientious news gatherer. At the time of
hia election to his present position Mr.
White was employed as a reporter on The
Call and it was with regret that his su
periors received his resignation.
Colonel Parnell. whom Mr. White suc
ceeds, resigned the position of secretary
of the society on September 8, to take the
position of military instructor at St. Mat
thew's Academy. Since that time the di
rectors of the society have been looking
for a man worthy to succeed Colonel Par
r.ell. Mr. White was their choice.
The directors of the society purpose
widening the scope of the organization's
work. \\ lth an energetic secretary, who
Is familiar with the duties of his Import
ant position, they expect to make their
society of. even greater value to this grow
ing community.
In selecting Mr. White for this import
ant office, the directors of the society had
in mind his executive ability and his val
uable experience as a newspaper man,
which made him particularly adapted to
the work of the organization. The new
secretary will enter on his work with all
the zeal he has manifested while pursuing
the elusive news* Item, lie has a wide
acquaintance and innumerable friends
who will aid him in the work he has un
dertaken.

the ten-foot ordinance becomes a law In
July, 1000, was finally passed.
The resolution df-clarinjr Gray Bros.'

ance and providing for the abatement of
the same was lost.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
fixed the tax levy for city, county and
State purposes at $1,025 on each $100 of
j taxable property. The city's rate was
fixed at $1,127 last June, but as a pre
caution the rate was re-enacted in order
to avoid a possible attack on the
legality of the levy If the State law, pro
1 vlding that It be made on the third'Mon
day la September, was not complied
with.
McCarthy attacked the validity of the
June levy because the rate had been based
on a total assessed valuation of $375,000,
000, whereas the roll was raised to $405,
000,000.
â¢"I cannot understand," said McCarthy,
"how, in'the face of the charter, the tax
payers are called upon to pay $300,000 in
excess of the amount actually required
for the expenses of the city government.
Again the budget ..provides for raising
$203,5uO for bonds that have not yet been
issued and such a course is clearly in
violation of a specific provision of the
charter. , eliminate that item from the
budget and have the tax rate on the ac
tual amount of the city's assessment and
the rate will be brought down to $0,981. It
is not right to collect any more money
from the taxpayers."
Keed made a vigorous reply to what he
termed a vicious attack on the charter.
He said he would vote against the order
re-enacting- the city tax rate passed in
June, as to pass such an order would be
playing into the hands of the enemies of
the charter.
"To do this," said Reed, "will be an
admission. that the charter is weak on the
tax levy. The levy passed, in June is
I valid and therefore cannot be changed. I
cannot see any reason to readopt a rate
which is already legal." â¢"
Tobin said the Finance Committee had"
recommended the rcafflrmation of the rate
on the advice of the City Attorney, who
thought it would be wise to do so. The
vote on the readoption stood:

fore an Immense audience last Saturday
night. 'He 'said in part: "The Legisla-
ture Is called together to enact laws for
the suppression and punishment of crime
the courts are maintained to mete outvto
criminals the penalty cf. the law, and of-
ficers arc elected to guard our laws and
Institutions. We have, however, been
subjected to a moat infamous class of Im-
migration during- the past quarter of a
century. That China* and Japan have sent
to the Pacific Slope their criminals and
outcasts and the very dregs of their pop-
ulation cannot be gainsayed. The exist-
ence of this country depends upon the
total restriction and removal of all such
undesirable Immigration." â¢
