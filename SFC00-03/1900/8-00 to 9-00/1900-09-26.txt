WASHINGTON, Sept. 25.-The I
United States Government to
day took the first step toward
the redemption of its promise
made to the Russian Govern
ment August 2S last, by a cablegram In- '
structing General Chaffee to reduce the !
American' forces in Peking to the propor- j
tlor.s of a legation guard. Nearly a month j
ago the Russian Government was told, i
through M. de Wollant. its Charge d'Af- .
falres here, that if the Russian forces ami j
Ministry were withdrawn from Peking, i
"we shall give Instructions to the Amer- I
lean commander in China to withdraw our i
forces from Poking, after due conference |
with the other commanders as to the |
time and manner of withdrawal."
That time has now come and to-day s !
action marks the beginning of the dis
appearance of the American army from
China, for although some military force
is to remain lt will not be of the character
of an army, but under the conditions laid |
down in the order to General Chaffee and \
especially under its official designation as
a "legation guard" will be rather of the
nature of a civil guard.
This small force will not be included In
any military operations which may be
conducted by the allied armies, and so
will not fall subject to the direction of
Field Marshal Count von Waldersee, the
commander in chief.
Much thought has been given to the
proper number of troops to be allotted for
this purpose and lt is believed that the
1400 men selected will be quite sufficient
to protect the American legation against
any force that could be brought about.
It is noteworthy, too. that the most com
plete arrangements have been ordered for
the maintenance of. the men, while care
has been taken that there shall not be
a shortage of ammunition, as there was
In the British legation during the siege.
About a week will be required to bring
the 3500 soldiers away rrom Peking, but
as the start cannot be made immediately
it will- at least be the end of the. flm
week in October before the movement cau
be completed.
The text of the order to General Chaf
. fee is as follows:
To General Chaffee, Peking: Sep
tember 25, No. 41. â Pending nego
tiations for a settlement the Secre
tary of War directs that a legation,
guard of a regiment of infantry, four
troops of cavalry, -with rapid-fire
guns, and light battery with complet?
equipment and reserve supply of am
munition adequate for any emer
gency, be retained in Peking under
your command, and that you send
the remainder of your force in China
to Manila to report to MacArthur.
The guard should be amply provis
ioned, etc., until navigation opens
next spring. Retain such officers for
staff duty as you deem necessary.
All stores, transportation and mate
rials not required for the legation
guard send to Manila. Place yourself
in close relations with our Minister,
acting with him on the lines that
will best subserve our interests. It
is important that you have the confi
dence of the generals of the other
powers. General Wilson with his aids
will remain in Peking for the pres
ent. Special instructions may be sent
him. Cable MacArthur concerning
requirements to carry these instruc
tions into effect. Inform general com
manding forces of other powers of
our intention to withdraw part of our
forces. Show this to Conger.
It Is stated at the quartermaster's de
partment that there are enough trans
ports available to bring off the force
which will come out of China. Three or
four vessels will be at Taku by the time
the troops are ready to move. Besides
the transports for the men a number of
animal ships will take away the horses
and -mules which will not be needed In
China. General Chaffee Is authorized to
take from the ships now at Taku such
stores as will be /necessary to last him
through the winter.
There were no developments in the dip
lomatic situation to-day, and although
Baron Sternburg, the German Charge
d' Affaires, and Minister Wu called separ
ately at the State Department they
brought no communications which were
made public. The Instruction to Minister
Conger relative to establishing relations
with the Chinese envoys is still withheld,
presumably to allow the President to ad
minister some finishing touches. This in
struction Is regarded as of much Impor
tance and will make a part of the case of
the Government and be laid before Con
gress at the next session. It Is settled
that Minister Conger Is to be a member
of the commission to settle the. various
questions remaining to be adjusted.
The reported adhesion of the British
Government to the position assumed by
tHe United States Government regarding
the proposition to make the surrender of
the Chinese ringleaders a condition pre
cedent to negotiations has given the
greatest satisfaction in official circles
here. . â¢
The report that Prince Tuan has been
signally honored by the Chinese Govern
ment has not yet been officially, confirmed,
although - the authorities have heard, of
boat Holland, reached the torpedo sta
tion at* 12:45. Both had torpedoed tha
Kearserge. The Holland was not seen by
any of the ships.
NEWPORT/I*. L, Sept. 25.â The Board
of Arbitrament met at the War College
to-day and considered the reports of tha
umpires on last night's maneuvers at
Newport, and gave out this afternoon the
following conclusions:
"The torpedo boats failed In their at
tacks on the ships and war vessels ran
past the forts, though in a badly crippled
condition. The former conclusion la sot
positive, as the claim that tha Stiletto
torpedoed the Massachusetts Is yet to bo
night of the maneuvers off this port was
not as spectacular as the first night and,
in this respect, was not a success. Tho
blockading fleet, which left the harbor
early In the afternoon, included the Kear
sarge, Indiana. Texas, Scorpion and
Eagle. It proceeded several miles out to
sea, far beyond Brenton lightship, and drew
up the line of blockade, stretching from
Point Judith to the eastward, with long
distances between the boats. The plan
of the maneuvers for the night was an
attack of the torpedo boats upon the
blockading squadron and an attempt by
the inside fleet to run out.
The Leyden was the only boat to make
the attempt to run out, and she was held
up by the Scorpion and put out of action.
The blockaders evidently tried to avoid
the attack, fearing the submarine boat
Holland. They burned no lights, except
as a torpedo boat was supposed to be ap
proaching within attacking distance, when
a searchlight was flashed and. Immediate
ly turned off again. The torpedo boats
had to look for their prey, and spent
hours In the search.
The Texas was far down to the west
ward, and the torpedo boats gave little
attention to her, concentrating their at
tention on the other boats. The Scorpion,
which had found the Leyden In tho Lit
ter's attempt to run the blockade, was
herself the first to be torpedoed by the
little Gwynn, and was technically sunk
after being chased for about forty min
utes. The Gwynn also successfully tor
pedoed the Eagle. Then she joined the
Morris and Rodgers In an attack on the
Kearsarge. The Rodgers was caught by
the big battleship's searchlight and put
out of action, but the Morris and Gwynn
were up within torpedoing distance and
claim a point against the Kearsarge. The
Morris had an especially good mark.
The Dahlgren had to go miles out to
sea In search of the Indiana, but found
her finally, and claims to have put a tor
pedo Into that vessel.
The conditions were In many respects
favorable, as the sea was perfectly
smooth and the sky clear and bright,
making a heavy darkness on the water,
so that lt was difficult to see small boats.
The screws, however, made a disturbance
In the water, which could be plainly seen
at a distance. In the stillness of the night
the sound of the working engines could
be heard for miles. In spite of this the
torpedo fleet apparently covered itself
with glory.

The diplomatic and military authorities

done. It is believed, will tend to a clear

The British Premier's decision to refuse

was communicated verbally to the Ger

feldt-Wildenburg, during the course of a
loner Interview this afternoon. His Lord
ship's decision is not known here and the
exclusive Information of the Associated
Press probably will not be officially given
cut in England until the reply Is put on
paper and transmitted to Berlin, which
may be to-morrow or later. Only a "few
officials are cognizant of what Lord
Salisbury said to Count von Hatzfeldt-
Wildenburg in regard to the latest devel
opment in the Chinese situation. Official
circles here were inclined to believe that
his LordsSIp would agree with Germany.
But instead of doing so, he used almost
exactly the terms In which Washington's
refusal was couched, and this, said a high
official, is "all the more surprising, con
sidering that the Washington official had
not the slightest inkling of what Eng
land's attitude would be." What will be
the result of this difference of view be
tween the United States and Great Bri
tain, on the one hand, and Germany, Aus
tria, France and Italy, on the other? No
official was found who was willing to risk
rn opinion, but all agreed in believing
that it did not entail a breaking off of the
negotiations.
Germany's Note.
LONDON*, Sept. 26. 3:50 a. m.â Only
through the Associated Press advices
from New York published In this morn

that the United States and Great Britain
are once again ranged together in opposi
tion to the Continental powers. Appar
ently such a grouping was entirely unex
pected in both Berlin and London, and
until an official statement is made, com
ment will be withheld.
The Daily Chronicle, however, devotes
a brief editorial paragraph to the an
nouncement, expressing a hope that It la
erroneous and declaring "that the only
way in which England can reap the fruit
of her exertions In China Is by standing
shoulder to shoulder with Germany and
Japan, as the only effective counterpoise
to Rupso-French machinations and the
weak-kneed policy of America."

It has grown worse during the last fort
night and the Consuls in Central and
Southern China are expecting a general
uprising. Advices from Dr. Mumm von

China, are In a similar tenor. Rear Ad
miral von Bendemann has repeatedly
cabled that the situation along' the
Yangtse Kiang Is very critical and also
expressing fear concerning the safety of
Kalsochou.
The German Foreign Offlce has received
official Information of the appointment of
Prince Tuan as Grand Secretary. In re
ply to an inquiry as to whether this in
dicated a serious turn of affairs a high
official of the Foreign Office said:
"Undoubtedly It does for those powers
that want to begin pe.ace negotiations.
The appointment moans that Tuan is now
at the helm and shows to what lengths
the Chinese Government will go In defy
ing the powers."
The official added that Germany feels
absolutely no bitterness over the answer
of the United States, although she regards
It as embodying a mistaken policy toward
China. There has been no further ex
change of views on the subject between
Berlin and Washington since the recep
tion of the American reply.
Mumm von Schwarzensteln will go to

IN THE HOWARD CASE
CHICAGO, Sept. 25.â Executives of the
Western railroads were in session to-day
in regard to the advisability *of forming
a pool on the military business to and
from San Francisco. After much discus
plon a committee representing the* Santa
Fe, Southern Pacific, Union Pacific and
Rio Grande roads was appointed and re
quested to submit a report concerning tho
formation of a pool on military business
and organization of a transcontinental
combination on passenger business.
The committee presented a report later
in the day. The provisions of the report
favored the formation of two pools, one
by lines east of Denver and EH Paso and
the other of lines west of those gateways
In this proviso the settlement of their
differences is left to the Santa Fe ond the
Southern Pacific without involving other
lines ln the dispute.
The. former company demanded a larger
percentage of business than the roads east
of the points named cared to consider. It
is believed, however, that an agreement
on this point will be reached to-morrow
and that the transcontinental pool ar
rangement will become an accomplished
fact.

John McCauley Palmer was born at
Eagle Creek, Scott County. Kentucky,
September 13, 1S17. His father was a
soldier in the war of 1S12, and subsequent
ly removed to Christian County, Ky.,
where John received a common school ed
ucation, making that place his home un
til 1S31, when his father, who was a de
cided anti-slavery man, removed with his
family to Illinois and settled about two
miles from Alton. In 1S34 John entered
Alton College, organized on the manual
labor system, but his funds failing, he
withdrew and entered a cooper shop.
Subsequently he became a peddler, and
in 1S3S accepted a position as. teacher in
a district school near Canton. The same
year he began the study of law. and in
1S39 removed to Carlinville, where In De
cember of that year he was admitted to
the bar.
SPRINGFIELD, 111.', Sept. 25.â General
John M., Palmer, ex-United States Sena
tor from Illinois, died at his residence in
this city' at 8 a. m. from heart failure.
General Palmer was an honorary pall
bearer at General McClernand's funeral
last Saturday. Last night he was on the
street viewing the State Fair Illumina
tions until a late hour, apparently in good
health. He had complained 'yesterday,
however, of a pain in his chest. He slept
uneasily last night. About 3 o'clock this
morning Mrs. Palmer called a physician,
who did not think the general's condi
tion alarming. The general awoke about
7 o'clock, still complaining. He talked to
his wife for a short time, then fell into
a doze and expired soon after.
In 1W he was an elector on the Lincoln
ticket.^and in April. 1861. was elected col
onel of the Fourteenth Illinois Regiment.
In October of the same year he was brev
eted brigadier general of volunteers. In
August. ]<*2. he organized th* One Hun

was made major general of volunteers,
and in 1S&> he was assigned to the mili

he neld the Governorship of Illinois, hav
ing been elected to that position bv tho

member of the Democratic party, havine
left the Republican party because Gen?
eral Sheridan used Federal troops to
guard Chicago at the time of the great
fire without consulting the Governor
He received the indorsement of the

THE LATE GENERAL. JOHN M. PALMER. EX-UNITED STATES SENA
TOR FROM ILLINOIS. WHO DIED SUDDENLY FROM HEART DIS
EASE YESTERDAY MORNING AT HIS RESIDENCE IN SPRING
FIELD.
f-rcd to our keeplnp. not by our design, but by
occurrrnco twyond cur control,
i If the opposition say tl'at this programme,
I written not in the statutes of man, but in [
the nature of things, will smother our insltu- ,
tions with R myriad or soldiers. I answer thai :
th>- world tn-day demonstrates that It will re- i
suit in the reverse. If they point to Germany :
nnd other nations with vast military estab
lishments to prove that colonization and ad
minlstr&tloa over lands hold a? possessions an:i
<l"tx>ndeni'les remits in the supremacy of tht- i
Foldiery over th" common people. 1 answer i
that the examples do not sustain but destroy '
the proposition. Consider Germany. Her stand- i
inj? army in times of peare is &62.C00 men. VKfc?. !
rdnnlzation cause or require them? No: t>e- |
calls* she maintained that mighty multitude
liofore the present Emperor his counselors
developed Germany's progressive colonial and
administrative policy. N'o asain. because of
Germany's standing army of 5fi2.<K>0 men, less
than 4000 are In her possessions, the remainder
of her mighty host helng stationed within the
empire itself. No again; because Austria, with
no colonies at all. has a standing army in
times of peace of over 3<il.C~<0 men. none, of
whom are employed in the care of possessions.
Xo acini: because France, a republic, has
a standing army in times of peace of 616.000
men. of which lesn Â«han 10,000 are employed in
her rolonies and possessions, except Algeria
and Tunl-s which are considered an immediate
part of France.
If the opposition pay that our constitution
forbids the American people to hold and pov
ern possessions as their situation may require
I demand that they shovr me the denial of that
I-ower in the constitution. We are a nation.
We can acquire territory. If we can acquire
territory, we can govern it. If we can gov
ern it. we can govern It as Its situation may
demand. If this Is not true, wo cannot Require I
any territory except such as may be governed
a* a part of the nation, with Its Inhabitants
as our fellow-citizens of the republic. But this
would forever prevent the - American people
from acquiring places of power and commer
cial advantage at the world's strategic points.
Po important a limitation upon our power,
otherwise inherent in us as a nation, must be
expressed in undoubted terms in our constitu
tion. I defy the opposition to the Government
to find such a prohibition in that great instru
ment.
The constitution says:
"The Congress shall have power to dispose
ef and make all needful rules and regulations
respecting territory or other property belonging
to the United State*." . *.
If the opposition leave the heights of moral
appeal and enter upon the common ground of
campaign arguments, even there we will meet
them. If they declare that if we keep the Phil
ippines the American workingman will suffer
by competition with Philippine labor. I answer
that one American will do more in a single day
than a Filipino will do in a workng week".
And. therefore, they cannot compete with us.
if they would. But they produce what we want
and cannot so well produce: we produce what
they need and cannot so well produce. And, j
therefore, we are by nature industrial brothers, '
rot industrial foes, and they would not compete |
with us If they could. Their products, their
climate and their soil are complements, not :
competitors, with ours. These ljcssesslcns make Â¦
us a world to and of ourselves. !
The epposition cite the Porto Uican law as j
proof that we will not pursue the proper pol- |
Icy, even conceding that we have the power.
Hut that law proves the reverse. The law on
the statute books is not the proposed act which !
caused the original opposition. The law as j
finally enacted iÂ» a compromise of all opinions I
within the Republican party. In the Senate j
there were Republicans who believed, and still
t.elleve, that commercial policy and sound
statesmanship require reciprocity between the
republic and its possessions; and we battled for
our opinions. There were those who believe
in a tariff with our possessions; and they bat
tled for their opinions. The\resuH was a com
posite of the views of all. as every practical
law must be. as the declaration of Independ
ence was. as the constitution of the l*nited i
States was. The act that finally passed and j
is now the law was the Senate civil government j
bill, which, while not perfect, is the best leg- I
islation ever constructed for a dependency. On j
to that law a section was engrafted which, as |
finally modified, provides free trade one -way !
immediately and free trade both ways as soon I
as the civil government of the island Is es- â¢
tablished. Free trade with Porto Rico is our
declared and enacted policy. The conflicting
views of Republican legislators were consid
ered. The conflicting views of Republican news
papers of the country were considered. The
crnflicting views of Republican voters of the
ecuntry were considered. And this Is the great
est glory of the Republican party; it Is the
only political organization In the world that
permits liberty of thought. No man dictates
to the Republican party its policies, as the
great chieftain of the opposition dictated his
policies to his convention at Kansas City.
Every Republican is honored within the party
for the maintenance of his convictions. And
those convictions are considered in the forma
tion of any low which a Republican majority
passes or any platform which a Republican
ccnventlon adopts. But the Democratic party
tolerates no independent thought. It concedes
nothing: to a minority, no matter how wise,
honest and heroic that minority may be.
The opposition demands that the shedding of
blood shall cease. So does the Government.
But blood will continue to flow until American
sympathy with the insurrection Is repudiated
by the American people. If from the first there
had been united support of the American Gov
ernment In holding aloft the American flag in
the Philippines, no bloodshed would have been
necessary, no lives of American soldiers re
quired to keep it floating there. Our dead
soldiers! The American gra\-es In that land
of sunset! The vacant chaira, flagr-draped. In
the homes of the republic! It Is a subject for j
speech. And those who cheered the misguided '
natives on to shoot those soldiers down! Those
who held out hope to Insurrection aralnet the
flag! It Is a subject too terrible for thought.
"What said Lawton â Lawton. Indiana's pride
and the republic's Bayard "without fear and
without reproach"? These are Lawton's words
of fire: "If I am shot by a Filipino bullet
: it might as well come from one of my own
Â¦ men because â¢ â¢ Â« the. continuance of thÂ«
flfThting Is chiefly due to reports that are eent
out from America." Who will wear on his fore
head the everlasting brand which Lawton's
words burn and 6hall burn while American
soldier* continue to fall under the flag In the
Philippines? I appeal to no passions; I state
the facts. The defeat of the opposition to the
Government here Is the defeat of the opposi
tlort, to the Government there.
THe strong, wise, tender-hearted man who
guides the nation's destinies to-day, and who
resembles Lincoln more than any President the
republic ever had, William MrKlnley. would
have prevented bloodshed If It had been possi
ble, with honor. He tried expedient after ex
pedient to compose the Philippines, until the
world looked on amazed at his forbearance
He 'has approved force with reluctance: and
only when the flag: he had sworn to defend
was hid by the battle smoke of hostile guns,
and torn at by the dark hands of insurrection'
only when anarchy whirled aloft Its torch and
civilization gasped at ARtiinaldo's order of
murder, and extermination, only then when
honor and humanity commanded, did our great
President, dauntless as he Is merciful, draw
the nation's sword.

THIS CLOSES
THE WAR IN
SOUTH AFRICA
Taking the situation as a whole In the
section of country included in these six
teen States, there is a very general and
t-trong movement toward the Republican
party.
South Dakota has four electoral votes,
which went to Bryan in IS.%. Notwith
standing tho strong fight made by Sena
tor Pettigrew for the fusion Legislature,
it is believed the State which went for
Bryan by less than 200 plurality four years
pgo will give its vote to Mclvlnley. The
ten electoral votes of Kansas are not
considered In doubt this year by those
most familiar with present conditions
throughout the State. The State, in ad
dition to these, of which Republicans are
most hopeful, is Idaho, and their claims
are sufficiently well founded to put Idaho
into the doubtful column. Republicans
also say that they may be successful in
Colorado. Montana -and Utah, but the
chances are better that the Democrats
will carry these States for their national
ticket. Utah is the most doubtful of the
three. Montana next and Colorado surest
Democratic. Allowing Idaho's vote to
MeKinley and the other ten doubtful
votes to Bryan, would give McKtnley
forty and Bryan pixty-one of 101 electoral
votes west of Missouri, which went fifteen
and eighty-six respectively four years
ago. >Â»
The sixteen States have 101 electoral
votes. Fifteen of theso went to McKin
ley and eighty-six to Bryan In 1S96. It is
p. conservative estimate of political con
ditions in these sixteen States to say that
McKlnley will receive this year at least
thirty-seven of these votes and Bryan
!ifty-one, leaving thirteen more or less
doubtful. Allowing that these thirteen
votes go to Bryan, a net sain of twenty
two votes is shown for MeKinley. Bryan
received J76 vote? in the Kiectoral Col
lege in 18LH3 and MeKinley 271. On the
bas's of political conditions in the West
as they are to-day, allowing that the
States east of the Missouri remain as
they were four years ago, Bryan's vote
in the Klectoral College this year would
be 154, as against McKinley's vote of 293.
In other words, Hryan must pain seventy
electoral votes east of the. Missouri River
ov^r what he received in 18% to be elect
ed in 1!Â«X>.
Air. Bryan will receive one vote less
from California than in 1S96, ten votes less
in Kansas, four votes less in South Da
kota, four ir. AVasbington and three In
Wyoming. There are thirteen other
doubtful votesâ four in Colorado, three in
Idaho, three in Montana, and three in
Utah. All of these went for Bryan in 18%
and the chances are good that he will
carry ten cast by Colorado, Montana and
Utah, while it seems possible that Me-
Kinley will secure the three votes of
Idaho. Washington, South Dakota. Wyo
ming and Kansas are claimed by the
Democrats as a matter of principle, but
careful inquiry in these States indicates
what might be called a tidal wave of Re
publicanism is In progress. California is
safely Republican. In Washington Demo
crats admit the probability of defeat. In
Wyoming the commercial interests are
strongly protectionist, and wool has dou
bled in price during the last four years.

If the opposition ask why this is the mission
of the American people now more than here
tofore. I answer that before any people as
sumes these great tasks it goes through a pro
cess of consolidation and unification. Just as a
man achieves maturity before he assumes the
taeki of a man. Great Britain never became
a colonixlng and administrating power until the
separate people of England, Scotland. Ireland
and Wales, welded into a single indivisible
people, were ready to go forth as a national
unit and do the great work to which the world
was calling it. The Cerman people did not
embark upon this natural policy until separata
dukedoms, principalities and kingdoms were
finally welded by a common war. common
blood, and common interests into a great sin
gle and indivisible people ready to go forth
as a national unit to the great work to which
the world -was calling them. The French be
came colonizers of lands and administrators of
(rovernroents only when her great statesmen,
from Richelieu to Colbert, had krtU the sepa
rate and divided French people Into* national
unit and sent it forth to the work to which the
world was calling It: and France declined only
KkÂ»n she abandoned that natural law of na
tlora! power and progress, and Napoleon di
verted her energies to the internal strifes of
Eurcie. Then her decline began. She lost
Canada. The Corsican told Louisiana to us.
And to-day French statesmen at last realize
the fatal operation of this law when once diso
beyed, and bo are peeking to become one of
the colonlclnc and administrating powers of
â¢arth again. And bo the American republic
haa been going through the process of fitting
It for the execution of this natural law of civ-
Iliiatlon. Hitherto we have had local divisions.
The proposition that we were a single people.
& 'national uÂ£lt. and not a rum of segregated
factions, wa* denied. And It required war and
commerce and time â the shedding of blood, the
uniting of communities by railroads and tele
granhs. the knitting together of the fabric of
nationality by that wonderful loom of human
Intelligence called the port; and finally, by the
common and united effort of a foreign war. ta
bring us to a consciousness of our power aa a
people. And there Is never In nature a power
without a corresponding purpose. And 6hall
we now stop this process of nature?
We are this at IaÂ»t. a great national unit
ready to carry out that universal law of civili
zation which requires of every people who have
reached our high estate to become colonizers
of new lands, administrators of orderly pov
ernment over savage an* penile peoples and

ADVERTISEMENTS.
THEORIES ABOUT FOOD.
Also a Few Facts on the Sams
Subject.
We hear much nowadays about health ]
foods and hygienic living, about vegeta-
rianism and many other fads along the
same line.
Restaurants may be found in the larger
cities where no meat, pastry or coffee fa
served and the food crank is in hla glory,
and arguments and theories galore ad-
vanced to prove that meat was never in-
tended y for human stomachs, and almost
make Â«s believe that our sturdy ancestors
who lived four-score years In robust
health on roast beef, pork and mutton
must have been grossly ignorant ot tho
laws of health.
Our forefathers had other things to do
than formulate theories about the food
they ate. A warm welcome was extended
to any kind, from bacon to acorns.
A healthy appetite and common sens*
are excellent guides to follow In matters
of diet, and a mixed diet of grains, fruits
and meats is undoubtedly the best.
As compared with grains and vegetables,
meat furnishes the most nutriment ln a
highly concentrated form and is digested
and Is assimilated more quickly than veg-
etables and grains.
Dr. Julius Remmson on this subject
says: "Nervous persons, people run down
in health and of low vitality should eat
i meat and plenty of it. If the digestion Is
; too feeble at first It may b^ easily correct-
I ed by the regular use of Stuart'3 Dyspep-
sia Tablets after each meal. Two of these
excellent tablets taken after dinner will
digest several thousand grains of meat,
eggs or other Animal food ln three hours,
and no matter how weak the stomach
may be no trouble will be experienced it
a regular practice is made of using Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets, because they
supply the pepsin and diastase necessary
to perfect digestion, and every form of In-
digestion will be overcome by their use.
That large class of people who come
under the head of nervoua dyspeptics^
should eat plenty of meat and insure its'"
proper digestion by the daily use of a safe,
harmless digestive medicine like Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets, composed of the nat-
ural digestive principlesâ pepsin, diastase,
fruit acids and salts, which actually per-
form the work of digestion. Cheap cathar-
tic medicines, masquerading under th<Â»
name of dyspepsia cures, are useless for
indigestion, as they have absolutely no
effect upon the actual digestion of food.
Dyspepsia in all It3 many forms is sim-
ply a failure of the stomach to digest foo>"!.
and the sensible -way to solve th<* ridi!>
and cure the dyspepsia is to make daily
use at meal time of a preparation lik*
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, which is in-
dorsed by the medical profession ami
known to contain active digestive princi-
ples. â¢ '

From reliable reports from all sections
of the Hooded valley above it would soem
that while there has been much damage
to crops and farmlnp property generally
no loss of life lias been reported up to to
night, as most c>f the people in the vicinity
received timely warnings. Reports from
south of here indicate that the valley was
Inundated and much damage done to
farms, but no loss of life.
Official reports from points west of San

effect that great damage has been done to
crops all along both the Colorado and San
Saba rivers. At noon to-day the Colorado
was reported falling at Marble Falls,
above here, but reports to-night say that
It Is rising again, showing that the waters
of the San Saba and Llano branches, as
well as from the upper Colorado, are just

by all day. Including tries, sections of
fences, frnsnnent.o of small frarr.e houses
and some dead cattle.

In pursuit. The highwaymen, being un
familiar with the country, started for a
bend In the Colville River and soon
reached the stream. Finding themselves
hemmed in and paying no attention to the
calls to surrender, they plunged into the
stream, which was about sixteen feet deep
at this point and 100 yards wide. They
fired at their pursuers just before entering
the water, but the bullets flew wide. As
the men swam the river bullets struck the
water all about them, and as they gained
the opposite bank one of the robbers fell
dead, a bullet having reached his heart.

deptroved. Of these, not a timber remains on
the original site and the wreckage constitutes
an embankment of debris extending along the
entire beach from three to four blocks inward
for about three miles, the removal of which
will cost JT50.000 to 11.000,000. From this debris
there are .Â«till daily uncovered by the workmen
now py^tpmatically employed, from thirty to
fifty bodies, which are burned or buried upon
the soot. Moreover, we estimate that 97'/4 per
cent of the remaining houses throughout the
city are damaged in greater or less degree.
On the removal of this debris in the clearing of
the ereets to make temporary repairs on
houses partly destroyed, in distributing
supplies and in the general work of restoration,
our entire citizenship are engaged. Men whose
eervioes could not be secured at this season
ordinarily are giving their time without com
pensation. Firms whose affairs usually re
quire the attention of three partners retain
one for the transaction of the business and
lend the other two to the public Bervice.
We cannot command language to express our
gratitude for the generous supplies of food,
clothing disinfectants, etc., from all quarters
and all agencies. By the world's generosity
there has been no hunger and now no naked
ness in Oalveston.
The munificent contributions in Tnoney sen*
to the Governor and directly to the relief com
m!ttt<Â« are perhaps sufllcient to defray the
Decenary expenses to the removal of the
wreckage and disposing of the dead bodies and
meeting tho mort urgent sanitary requirements.
Hut when this Is done the special work of res
toration will only have begun. The homeless
will still be without shelter and household goods,
the mt-chante without tools, the washerwoman
without wa.Â«htubs and seamstress without a.
machine.
Were our task but to afford temporary relief
find to care for the wounded and orphans, *'an
appeal to Tevas alone would be sufficient. The
wounded and orphans are comparatively few.
Â«>ince only the sturdiest were able- to combat
the maddened elements. But a greater and a
graver work confronts us.
Some kind of homes, be they ever bo hum
ble, must be provided for the ten thousand
people now huddled in ruined houses, public
places and improvised camps, to the end that
they may not become paupers, but may ppeed
lly set up their households, wherein repose all
that is best and noblest in American life. We
believe that the well-to-do and charitable peo
ple of this nation will not be contented to
merely appease hunger and bind up bruises
but will in very large measure and vrlth morÂ»
far-reachlns rffect contribute to the restoration
of these people to a plane of self-support and
pelf-respect. It Is for this purpose we make
this further appeal.
For such temporary measures as are ex
plained in the foregoing we have at present
sufficient supplies. But they are only a tithe
of the larger needs herein set forth, and gener
ouk people of the nation will best serve the
situation and their own alms by making theli
contributions Jn moner.

Bank of California reported:
A Friend SO
to-day, aside from the request for sol
diers, was the answer of G. B. Markle &
Co. to the demands presented by the
firm's employes ten days ago. The answer
is not considered satisfactory by many of
the Markle employes and what action
they will take at their meeting to-mor
row Is not certain. There Is much talk
among them to-night in favor of a strike.
The firm flatly refuses to grant the de
mands of the men for a 5 and 10 per cent
advance; announces its willingness to pay
the men semi-monthly: agrees to arbi
trate the question of cheaper powder; re
fuses the demands of the driver boys anil
engineers for more pay; promises to ad-

scale for propping which is lower than
the rate asKed for; agrees to build powder
houses so that^the men will not have to
carry the explosive a great distance, and
concedes the r'llar-robbing grievance.
The Markle .irm to-day announced that
at "the. request of the mine workers in
its reply, work will be suspended to-mor
row in order to give the men an oppor
tunity to consider the company's answer
to their demands made ten days ago."
The IJnited Aline Workers held a meet
ing at Jeddo this afternoon before the an
swer of the Markles had become public.
Many of the Marklo strikers were present.
The principal speech was made by Presi
dent Mitchell, who, having heard a rumor
that the Markles had granted the de
mands of the men, urged the miners who
had struck not to go back to work, but to
stand firm in the flght until victory comes

MOBE MINES TO BE TTED UP.

SHAMOKIX. Pa., Sept. 25.â Local strike
leaders say that from the Information re
ceived to-night the Locust Springs Col
liery at Locust Gap, operated by the
Philadelphia and Reading Coal and Iron
Company, will be completely tied up to
morrow. It has been working short
handed for several days. They claim that
the Ashland mines also will be shut down
in a few days.
Mine officials here are Jubilant over the
resumption" of work at the North Frank
lin Mine No. 1 at Trevorton, also a Phila
delphia and Reading Company operation.
The men almost in a body failed to report
yesterday, but the whole of them returned
to work this morning. Â«
The Clerks' Association, the Shamokln
branch of the International Association ot
Retail Clerks, have voted in favor of the
strike, and their president. J. N. Martz.
will appoint a committee to confer with
the executive body of the Central Labor
Union as to the most advantageous means
of distributing- food and funds to those
suffering from the strike's effects.
THREE COLLIERIES CLOSED.
Number of Men Who Seported Not
Sufficient to Work Them.
SHENANDOAH, Pa,. Sept. 25.â The few
developments In the strike situation since
The troops to-day had nothing to occupy
their time but guard duty, practice
marches and regimental parades.
The English-speaking mine workers of
this borough to-day formed a branch of
the United Mine Workers and 250 are said
to have joined the union. Mr. Harris,
addressing the men. said that the pres
ence of the militia has given unexpected
impetus to organization. He also stated
that 27,000 of the 35.000 mlnÂ» workers in
dl3tiict 4 (the Schuylkill dLstrlct) were
idle.
Other collieries In the region still In
operation are the Blast, at Ashland:
Potts, at Locustdale; Locust Springs, at
Locust Gap, and the North Franklin, at
Trevorton. The Blast celllery is said to
be shorthanded.
t
yesterday were favorable to the strlkera.
Three additional collieries were closed to
day in this region because the number of
men who reported for duty was not suf
ficient to operate them. They were the
Park Place, Plttston No. 3 and Lawrence
collieries. The Park Place workings were
in operation for a short time to-day, but
could not continue with the small force.
In this city only one colliery is working.
That is the Cambridge, which, according
to J. C. McGinnia of the Cambridge Coal
Company, has Its full complement of men.
General Superintendent Kudlick of the
Coxe Brothers & Co.'s mines was arrested
to-day on a charge of assault and several
minor charges. He waived a hearing on
two of the charges this- afternoon and
will be given a hearing on the other
charge to-morrow. Peter Gallagher, a
striking miner of Freeland. is the prose
cutor. He charges that Kudllck dellb-
The operators at other collieries
claimed, as usual, that they were in bet
ter shape to-day than at any previous
time during the strike.
Coxe Brothers & Co. admitted to-day
that their collieries at Derringer and
Gowen were slightly affected this morn-
Ing, but claimed that the men who did
not go to work were Intimidated by tho
marchers.
"Reports from the Schuylkill district are
that the entire Mahanoy Valley from Ma
hanoy City to Ashland is idle. This is a
gain of three large collieries. In the Le
high Valley region, Eckley, Derringer,
Tomhicken and Gowen were closed to
day and we made satisfactory gains at
other mines where the men- have been
working, lt^ is generally conceded that
the strike In the Schuylkill district will
soon embrace every man employed there.
On the whole we are well satisfied with
the status of the strike."
demand, which Is only about half of what
the United Mine Workers are asking
throughout the region, it was feared thero
would be a big break among the men who
struck at the Markle mine. They now
believe that the firm's mines will be com
pletely tied up and point to Its voluntary
suspension as evidence that the Markles
are afraid that their men will quit.
President Mitchell, in discussing the sit
uation In this region to-night, said:
Sheriff's request was backed up by sev
eral telegrams from private citizens of
Hazleton, who, It is said, are mine oper
ators.
It is believed that the Sheriff Is of the
opinion that the presence of troops will
prevent any further marching, thus les
sening the possibility of serious trouble.
Last night's march of 300 men from Cran
berry, Tomhicken, Derringer and Gowen
prooably hastened the action of Sheriff
Harvey in asking for State help.
The strikers met after midnight at Cran
berry, and when they reached Tomhicken
they were stopped by Sheriff Harvey and
thirty armed deputies, who went to that
place on a special train. It was yet
dark, and the Sheriff read the riot act to
them by the light of a lantern. The strik
ers then scattered in different directions
and began missionary work in preventing
mine-workers from going to the Potts
mine at Tomhicken. Derringer and Gowen.
They were successful in preventing a
large number of men from going to work,
and In consequence the Derringer and
Gowen mines were crippled. The Tcm
hicken slope was only slightly afTected.
Four of the marchers were arrested
charged with breach of the peace, and
In the afternoon were taken to South
Wllkesbarre and committed without bail.
There was no conflict between the depu
ties and the strikers. Rhone Trescott a
coal and iron policeman, says he saw
President Mitchell and "Mother" Jones
on a hill at Derringer directing the move
ments from it. Mr. Mitchell denies this.
It was rumored that another march was
to be made to-morrow to Black Creek
three miles from Hazleton. .
The most Important development here
Peace Officer Trying to Stop Nig-lit
Marches of the Strikers.
HAZL.ETOX. Pa., Sept. 25.â It was
learned to-night that Sheriff Harvey has
telegraphed to Governor Stone asking that
troops be sent to this county on the
ground that he cannot guarantee the
safety of persons and property during the
night marches of the etrikers. The Gov
ernor, it is understood, is eonsiflering the
matter. It was also learned that the
SHEBIFF ASKS FOR TROOPS.
The answer of Markle & Co. to the bill
of grievances presented by their mine
workers has complicated matters some
what In the Lehigh region. While con
cessions are maCe to the men, the belief
was general at Hazelton to-night that the
refusal to grant the increase In pay asked
for will not suit the ideas of the men an<5
will induce some of them at least to Join
the strikers* ranks.
._ ~ *
Beyond the incident of the Sheriff dis
persing the strikers the entire coal re
gions were quiet. Few mines were worked
to-day, the strikers' ranks were increased
and no defections were reported.
Rioting In previous miners' strikes
usually resulted from the acts of march
ing bodies of strikers, and the Sheriff,
being apprehensive, is endeavoring to
break up this style of campaigning.
Four of their number were placed under
arrest on the charge of breach of the
peace.
PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 25.â The
most Interesting development In
the coal strike situation to-day
was the request of another coun
ty for State troops to assist the
mihorltlcs in maintaining order. On Fri
d '- lut the Sheriff of Schuylkill County
asked the Governor for troops and the
request WM prantwj, three regiments of
â¢Â¦':Â¦.â¢ National Guard b^lng sent to that
county.
To-day Sheriff Harvey of I^uzeme Coun
ty notified the Governor that owing to
the night marches of the strikers he could
a< t suarantre the safety of persons and
property and a.Â«k*Â»d tliat State troops be
r.- ::t to hip county.
Tb:- Governor after deliberation con
cluded that the situation at present in
I.-izorne did not justify the sending of
State troops there, and he tvill not call
< :t more troops until in his judgment
there Is Fufficient cause therefor. He -will
to-morrow confer further with Sheriff
Harvey on the subject.
The marching strikers in Luzerne Coun
ty before rtayllght this morning- were
quite successful in Retting men to quit
work and Join In the strike. No overt act
vrss committed by them, however, and
ivhÂ« n met by the Sheriff and his deputies
and ordered to disperse they obeyed, the
order. They did so, though In rather a
sullen rsanner and some of them some
what angrily disputed the Sheriffs au
thority to prevent their moving along the
highway.

Attempt of the Defense in the Zum

PI.ACERVIIvLB. Sept. 25.â Shortly aft
er the Superior Court convened this morn

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Sept. 25.-
An interesting game of football was
played on the college campus this after
noon between the freshmen and Palo Alto
High School team. During the first half
Stanford had the ball most of the time,
working- their way to Palo Alto's five
yard line, Here they were held and lost
the ball on downs. Palo Alto made thirty
five yards on a fumbled punt and forty
five more by straight-line bucking and
end running. The half ended with the
ball on Stanford's thirty-yard line, neither
side having scored.
Palo Alto had the better of the playing
during the second half. After working
the ball across the field they lost it on
downs on Stanford's twenty-yard 'line.
Stanford punted out of danger and time
was called with the ball In. the center of
the field.

the card of which is as follows:
The polo game was divided into four
periods. The Redsâ Charles Dunphy, Tom
D.riscoll and Peter Martin, walked away
from the Whites â John I^awson. Walter
McCreery and F. J. Carolan. The score
was 6" for Red and 1 for White. Dunphy
and Drlscoll divided the points for their
side. F. J. Carolan being the scorer for
the losers.
Then came the saddle horse exhibit.
John Parrott's Padre won from F. J. Car
olan's Diana, who wns made happy with
a red ribbon for his entry in class 109.
The polo ponies held sway frrm this ex
hibition until the close of the day. In

SAN FRANCISCO ha3 had its
horse showsâ tanbark ring af
fairs, boxes lined with gayly and
richly dressed women and dress
suited menâ but it remained for
the San Francisco and San Mateo Agri
cultural Association to Introduce the nov
elty of an out-door horse exhibit. This
was the feature at Tanforan yesterday,
the concluding event on the programme
being a polo game between rival Burlln
game teams, in reality the most interest
ing of the day's attractions.
Two accidents that had no serious con
sequences supplied the few heart palpita
tions of the second day of the fair. Dur
ing the tandem show John Parrott's team
took fright at the music. The leader be
caino unmanageable, and succeeded in
overturning the rig, spilling the groom
and attendant who -were in the box. No
damage was wrought except to the cart.
During the polo game Charlie Dunphy's
pony suddenly displayed a penitential
frame of mind and dropped on Its knees,
forcing the rider Into some" fancy somer
saults and ground tumbling. A third cas
ualty, the loss of a polo mallet by John
Lawson, summed up the chapter of acci
dents.
The Incidents were a horse show com
mencing at 1:30 p. m. and lasting until
4:30. when the polo game between the
Reds and the Whites was called. The
Reds proved themselves unequivocal vic
tors in a very one-sided score.
First of the horse show was a competi
tion between two roadsters. K. O'Grady's
Guliner was the winner of the blue rib
bon, John Curley's Belle being disquali
fied on account of poor equipment.
Charles Newman's handsome roan team,
Maud Newman and Neerbell, the only en
try In the class, then paraded on the
track. Driven by Newman himself, they
made the best showing of the day. Be
sides giving Newman the blue ribbon, he
was awarded a special prize.
Maggie II, belonging to K. O'Grady,
took the blue ribbon in class 73, for the
best pacing roadsters, three years old or
over. Jn class 78, for novices bred on the
Pacific Coast, another harness event,
Henry J. Crocker, driving Cloverdale,
fook the blue ribbon; Charles Templeton
Crocker's Ben Bolt the red ribbon, and
Moorland, owned by Henry J. Crocker,
tho white ribbon.
Class S7. novice tandem teams for park
use. went to Henry J. Crocker, driving
Cloverdale and Moorland together. Par
rott's. Brigand and Cockade caused their
own undoing and nearly the end of Mr.
Parrott's driver, so they received nothing.
Bessie, a pony hitched to an appropriate
trap, won another blue ribbon for Henry
Crocker. No other pony was entered in
this class. No. 93.
Class 98. pony tandems, brought out
three very swell teams â Chum and Pal
from John Parrott's stables, blue ribbon
winners; Blaze Away and Fiddlesticks,
driven by F. J. Carolan, and a team en
tered by Peter Martin. Carolan received
the red.

that as Walker had taken a nomination

RIVERSIDK. Sept. 25.-Samuel M.
Shortridge, tho Republican orator, opened
the campaign in this city this evening at
Ixjring Opera-house. The meeting was
one of the largest, and most enthusiastic
ever held during a political campaign
here. The speaker made an excellent ad
dress and handled the Issues of the cam
paign in. a masterful and convincing man
ner. He was frequently interrupted by
applause. Captain M. J. Daniels acted as
chairman of the meeting, introducing Mr.
Shortridge.
Mr. Shortridge first spoke of the tariff,
question, which he declared was ono of
the greatest of present issues and one that
the orange growers of this city had every
reason to be watchful of. He declared
that the tariff was the salvation of the
country and that if It had not been for
the Dingley bill the country's finances
would to-day he in as bad shape as when
Cleveland left the White House four years
ago. A substantial tariff, one that would
protect the industries of the country, wan
essential to the welfare ot the nation.
The next subject taken up was the cry
of "imperialism," which he characterized
as nothing more or less than a nightmare
â a bluff Invented by the Bryan followers
to hoodwink voters and 10 prevent them
seeing tho real issues that most concerned
them.
Mr. Shortridge said that the policy of
the administration in the Far East waJ
one that could not have been avoided.
The country had purchased the Philip
pinesâand that. too. with the consent o*
Air. Bryan â and now it was holding what
belonged to it.
The trust problem was discussed at
some length. Mr. Shortridge referred to
the combination of orange growers, which
he said was thought to be all right, even
by Democratic orange growers, doubtless
because they profited from it.
The speech was well received and will
add strength to the party here. It will
do much toward increasing the vote for
the Congressional nominee. J. C. Need

ENTRANCE. /Oi san francisco. 2S5Â£VÂ£Â£LAST DAY FOR
REGISTRATION
Â»
Registrar Walsh estimates that there are at least 2500 citizens who have
not yet registered, and as to-day is the last day for registration he has made
extensive preparations for the expected crush at the Registrar's office. He
says he is fully prepared to register that number of voters with dispatch, and
will keep the office open from 8 a. m. until midnight to-do It. A force of fifty
clerks will be on hand to take depositions.
~\Valsh bases his estimate on a comparison with the registration of 1S98,
which was 72,000. The natural increase should raise the figures to 74,000. The
total registration up to and including last evening is 71.500. leaving 2500 yet to
be enrolled. The registration at the City Hall was 60,500, while the precincts
returned about 11,000.

for Congress in the First District, opened
his campaign -it Susanville last night. His
tour represents the following engagements
to speak:
On motion of William Denman the chair
was instructed to appoint a committee on
purity of election and one on vacancies.
On the former committee he appointed A.
G. Maguire, Max Popper, Dr. T. B. "W.
LolanJ. hi. C. Hassett_and Thomas W.
Hlckey. As the committee on vacancies
he named R. V. Whiting, J. F. Renault,
C. H. Murphy. "Emil Pohll and John Fen
nell. â¢
Its work being ended the convention
then adjourned.
Coombs' Campaign.
Thomas W. Hlckey took the platform to
name a candidate, "who as an equalizer
will be unequa'.ed." He nominated Hull
McClaughry. Nominations were closed
und the secretary cast the ballot for Mc-
Claughry.
Curtis Hillyer moved that the conven
tion take a recess of fifteen minutes and
that the delegates organize as a district
convention to nominate a member of the
Board of Equalization. R. F. O'Nell, who
held a proxy In the Thirtieth District,
objected to a recess. He said the nomina
tion was "all settled, anyway," and he
did not see the necessity of wasting time
In a recess. William Denman explained
the legal necessity for organization as a
district convention and the recess was
taken for that purpose.
J. W. Shanahan of the Forty-third Dis
trict stated that J. J. McGuire had been
nominated for Assemblyman without his
knowledge or consent, and that he refused
to accept. The delegates had chosen
Eustace Cullinan as their nominee. Â«
A. G. Maguire announced that William
J. Eagan, the original nominee for Sena
tor from the Twenty-first District, had
declined the nomination, and that the
delegates had met again and chosen As
semblyman William E. White as the can
didate.
The work of the caucus being completed
Chairman Bartlett called the convention
to order. J. F. Renault reported the re
sult of the caucus.
After Ward's speech an enthusiastic del
egate from the Thirty-ninth District in
troduced their candidate for Assembly
man, W\ T. McClain. Mr. McClain, also
a young man, said that he had had hia
picture taken that afternoon for the first
time In his life and had then gone to work
to secure votes.
Louis H. Ward, the nominee. Is a grad
vate of St. Man's College, class of '95.
and was admitted to practice law before
the Supreme Court two years and a half
ago. He is the youngest of all the can
didates for Senator. He is a deputy In
District Attorney Bylngton's office.
and after cheers for him and for each of
the districts the newly chosen candidate
was called upon for a speech. He prom
ised to work hard to secure election. He
said he believed in the nomination of
young men. which Is natural in view of
the fact that he is but twenty-four years
old, and referred to the noted Nebraskan
at the head of the ticket as a young man.
He didn't call him "Williams Jennings
Bryan" nor "William J. Brennings." Hi3
version of It was "James Jennings
Bryan."
By Inadvertence the name of Arthur
Flske was omitted from the list of Re
publican nominees for. the Assembly a^s
published In yesterday's Call. Mr. Fiske
was nominated by the delegates of the
Thirty-seventh Assembly District.
Arthur Fiske Nominated.
The Thirty-first Assembly District Kahn
Club met last evening at Trades Hall and

CITIZENS' REPUBLICAN PARTY
PRIMARY ELECTION.
It is probable that the bosses will hold
a meeting either to-day or to-morrow and
decide upon some line of action to meet
the demand of their drivers. Some there
are who consider the circular sent out to
be only a feeler, inasmuch as it bore no
signature, stamp or mark to Indicate
whence it emanated.
To this circular the boss teamsters are
disposed to pay but little attention Just at
present. They say the time is too short
to make the sought-for concessions, and,
further, that the great majority of dray
men and teamsters have yearly contracts
with merchants and shippers which have
been made under existing conditions. To
change these at such short notice would
be a direct loss to either the merchant or
the hauler. Terms and competition are
so close that any figures increasing the
rate of hauling would go far to upset the
relations existing between merchants and
consumers. The demanded increase of
wages must be borne by some persons if
insisted on. It follows that the consum
ers must be called upon to meet the loss,
for as It now stands the haulers cannot
afford to lose it, as they are down to the
lowest margin of expense.
It is to correct this and to have one
uniform scale of wages that the whole
subject matter was)' referred to a commit
tee of the brotherh6od with power to draw
lines between employers and drivers
which would be fair to both.
The following is the scale as adopted
and approved by the organization:
SAN" FRANCISCO, Sept. . 17. 1900.
V>'e, the Brotherhood of Teamstere of San
Francisco, demand wages' at following rates:
Four-horse truckmen, at $3 50 per day; two
horse truckmen, at $3 per day; one-horse truck
men, at ?2 Â£0 per day; fruit teamsters. In sea
fen, at $20 per week; wagons or 5 tons capacity
and over, at {3 per day; wagons of 2Vi tons ca
pacity to 5 tons, $2 &u per day; wagons of 1
ton capacity to 2H tons, $2 per day; wagons
of 1 ton capacity and less. $10 per week. Work-
Ing hours to be from 6 a. m. to 6 p. m. Over
time â Four-horse truckmen, per hour, 75 cents;
two-horse truckmen, per hour, GO cents; one
horse truckmen, per hour, 3o cents; wagons of
5 tons and over, per hour, 50 cents; wagons of
24r,to 5 tons, per hour, 35 cents; wagons of 1
to 2% ton?, per hour, 35 cents; wagons of less
than one ton, per hour, 20 cents; fruit team
sters, after 6 p. m., per hour, 50 cents; work
ing Sundays and holidays, time and a half;
taking care of teams on holidays, day's pay;
taking out team any part of day, day's pay.
To take effect Monday, October 1, 10W.
With the teamsters the trouble is not
so difficult of adjusting as it may seem on
the face of the circular. The majority of
employers are paying almost as much as
is asked. The real trouble seems to be in
the hours of work without any allowance
for overtime.
Concessions must be made between the
men who own trucks, drays and wagons
and the men who drive them before next
Monday or there will be Idle horses, un
employed drivers and freight unmoved.
This condition of affairs is brought about
by the action of the Brotherhood of
Teamsters, a new organization of the
men who crack the whips. This organi
zation, which was formed last month,
boasts of having 1400 members enrolled,
and all of them are said to be unionized
to the extent that if the terms of the at
tached circular which was placed in the
hands of every man who owns a wagon
and who does hauling for hire are not
complied with there will be a general
clash.

BELIEVING she had lost her place
la the affections of the man she
loved Mrs. Eva Suydam, whose
home is at the Hotel Suther
land, at the comer of Sutter and
Jones streets, attempted to end her life
yesterday afternoon by inhaling chloro
form. Although 6he had meditated her
desperate step for a n-.onth or more and
had made every arrangement to assure
the success of her plan she was saved at
almost tho last moment by occupants of
the room next to hers, who were attracted
to her apartments by her groaning and
heavy breathing. She was tak^n at once
to the Receiving Hospital and there, af
ter the usual restoratives had been ap
plied, she rallied and will soon be able
to make the second attempt, which she
threatens.
Mrs. Suydam was once well known in
San Francisco society. She was the wife
of William H. Suydam, at one time freignt
agent on this coast for the Union Pacitlc
Railroad. A year ago she divorced him
because of his attentions to a Mrs. Leo
core Markburjrh and he was transferred
to one of the Eastern offices of the com
panv. Five months ago she met George
II. fc>icks?on, a voung man in the employ
of the C. C. iloore Company, boiler
makers, at 32 First street, and became
infatuated with him. Dickson had then
been a widower but a month and ap
parently yearned for sympathy. He found
ft in Mrs. Suydam and up to a month ago
their affections grew. Then Oickson sud
denly displayed a change of demeanor.
He became cold and called less frequently
The woman did all in her power to
shield the man who has scorned her. She
refused at first to give his name, but
when it was obtained from other sources
she was compelled to admit their inti
macy. Her preparations for suicide were
most elaborate. She procured a two-ounce
bottle of chloroform ind, lying down on
her bed, saturated a piece of cotton with
the drug and laid it across her face. Over
this she laid a cloth, also saturated, and
then pulled the bedclothes over her head.
She was unconscious when found.
"Ever since we were divorced," said she,
"my husband and his friends have hound
ed me and done their utmost to ruin my
reputation. When tiiey found that I was
friendly with Mr. Dlckson they went to
him and from that time his feeling toward
me changed. Nothing 1 could say made
any difference and I became desperate
and blue. Things have always gone
wrong with me and I was tired of it all
and wanted to die. I thought at first I
would jump off a ferry-boat and then
to keep myself from doing that I had my
little son brought to the hotel where I
was staying. Yesterday mornlnpr I went
to George's room, at the Ashworth anil
had breakfast there with him. He had
promised to see me the night before, but
had not kept his promise, and when 1 saw
him yesterday morning I said all the un
kind things I could think of. He kiss,ed
me good-by kindly and sent me away
and then I went back to my rooms to end
it all. I did not succeed this time, but
I will the next. I don't want to live and
I will not."

own words.

Sergeant Tobin had seen the bunko man
and Cheney go into the O'Farrell-street
house and he telephoned to police head
quarters. Detectives Ryan and Dillon
were sent to the place, and as the bunko
men and Cheney left the house they were
all arrested, with the exception of Che
ney's friend, who managed to escape. E.
F. Holbrook, who' was also with tnem,
was arrested at the same time. The bag
of bullion was in the custody of ureen.
Cheney swore to complaints yesterday
charging Green and Bates and "John
Doe" with grand larceny. Green and
Bates were booked at the prison and the
detectives are searching for Cheney's
young friend. Holbrook, who took no part
in the bunko game, was booked for va
grancy.
Cheney's young friend and the other
two began a game of poker, and Cheney's
friend lost and borrowed $20 from him.
He would not part with more coin, as his
suspicions became aroused that something
was wrong.
Cheney was walking along Market
street, when he was approached by a
well-dressed young man who pretended to
bÂ© a stranger in the city on his way to
Honolulu. Cheney was Induced to go to a
lodging-house at 413 O'Farrell street,
where he was introduced to William
Green, alias "Judge Bates," and Charles
Bates, alias "William Davis," two of the
beBt known bunko men In the city. Green
was represented as the assayer in the
Mint, and Cheney handed him the bag
with the silver bullion which he was to
exchange for coin. ,
Robert Cheney, a recent arrival from
China, made the acquaintance of a gang
of bunko men Monday and In a very short
time parted with $20 in cash and sliver
bullion of the value of $110 which he car
ried around with him in a bag.

When the hearing of the writ was called
by JadeÂ© Lawlor yesterday morning the
Irregularity of the indorsement of the
warrant was explained to the court. Judge
Lawlor said that the arrest of the de
fendant was plainly unlawful and that the
defendant was illegally restrained. It Is
eaSd that "Wells" arrest was the reBult of
eplte work. Constable Ahern of Port Cos
ta arrested Wells a few weeks ago on a
petty charg-ft. Wells retaliated by charg
ing Ahern with having robbed him of $7
in coin and a watch. Ahern then charged
Wells with libel, and the warrant was is
sued for his arreet. Judge Lawlcr eaid
that It was evidently the purpose of the
Port Copta authorities to cauee the second
arrest of "Wells to shield Ahern from the
consequences of his act In unwarrantedly
arresting the defendant on the first
charge.
Wells has been advlped to bring an ac
tion against the Port Costa Constable for
damages for false Imprisonment.
J. C. "Wells, tha young miner who was
arrested Monday evening by Constable
Johnson of Port Costa on a charge of

Weekly Call, $1 per YearThe issue which has taken foremost place in the
minds of the people is that of tariff regulation. The
leaders on each side have, already organized for the
conflict. A correspondent of the London Chronicle
says: "The protectionists throughout the continent
have been drawn closer together by means of secret
conferences at Melbourne and Sydney, and by manu
facturers' conclaves at the capital cities of most of
REPORTS from Australia are to the effect that
since the federation of the colonies is assured
the Australian politicians are making ready for
their first fight on federal issues. There are of course
well organized parties in each province, but these will
be broken up by the new questions at stake and dif
ferent alignments will have to be made. There is
naturally a great deal of interest in the subject, and
the contest will be one of the liveliest the Australians
have ever known.

PERSONAL MENTION.
In due time The Call will specify the more objec
t:onable candidates named by Kelly and will give
reasons why they should be defeated. It suffices to
day to point out to all Republicans that this ticket
aiominated by Kelly is not in any rightful sense a Re
publican ticket. Every candidate on it might be de
feated without in any way affecting the vote for Re
publican candidates fcr Congress and for Presidential
Electors. Right-thinking Republicans will support
nominees who rightly represent Republicanism, but
they will -not support the Kelly ticket. Whatever
Herrin and Van Fleet may do. Republicans who arc
loyal to the political principles of the party will take
advantage of the opportunity of election day to kick
Kelly out and the objectionable members of his
t'eket alone with him.
When Herrin and Van Fleet took Kelly up he was
but a little tin boss crushed and thrown into the
gutter. They have made him over in the form of a
huge Chinese joss, vast of paunch, heavy of jowl,
slant-eyed and many-handed. He is their own crea
ture, and doubtless after all they have something of
i.n author's pride in him. They do kow-tow to him,
as a Chinaman to his idol, seeing that he is ugly, but
Relieving he is great. It is clear that at this time
their emotions must be conflicting, and they are in
doubt whether to be proud that they have created a
boss whom they cannot kick out. or to be ashamed
for asking another man to kick out the boss they
made.
What are Herrin and Van Fleet going to do now?
They have demanded that Kelly be kicked out, but it
i> Kelly who has done the kicking. Will they vote
lor bis ticket, or will they kick it out?
It wa- too late to kick Kelly out; it was too late to
throw Kelly ofT. The new boss had got himself
astride the saddle and all the bucking of the railroad
availed nothing. He has had the satisfaction of beat
inn the men who created him. of mocking at the dig
nity of Herrin and the respectability of Van Fleet.
He has had the glory of going into the convention, of
making speeches there, of nominating the chairman,
o: escorting him to the platform and of dictating the
ticket.
Just then, however, the Southern Pacific conceived
certain schemes it did not dare to submit to honor
able Republicans. a:id Herrin, the political manager
of the corporation, turned to the discredited Kelly
and besought his aid. No doubt Herrin regarded
Kelly aÂ» a mere tool to be used at his pleasure anJ
ihen thrown aside again. The Hon. \V. C. Van Fleet
had of course the same thought when at the Santa
Cruz convention he acted as sponsor for Kelly and in
troduccd him to the world as a Republican leader.
Neither of them had for a moment so much as a sus
picion that Kelly would aspire to open leadership,
.vould grasp the whin and mount to the saddle, and,
therefore, when Kelly exhibited signs of assuming
such mastery great was the confusion in the railroad
cam;). Herrin was amazed. Van Fleet was abashed,
.â¢Mid the railroad's evening organ began to scream in
hip type. 'Kelly if- a tascal. Kelly is a traitor, Kelly
i- a monster â kick Kelly out."
Kelly's rise to power constitutes an instructive les
s-on. Two years ago the decent Republicans of San
I-'rancbco revolted against his practices in politics
and excluded him. his political partner, Crimmins,
and all their push from any influence in the party.
Thns driven out and discredited, it appeared that
Kelly would never again have prestige with any class
oi voters. He had n^ver been anything more than a
&lnm politician, doing his work in the obscurity of
the back rooms of saloons, but even in that sort of
vork it seemed unlikely he would ever have much
success again. In fact, the only recourse that ap
peared open to him wras to join the Democratic party
?nd pose as a convert
\/l ARTIX KELLY ha< gathered his henchmen
I \ to a meeting under the name and with sonic
of the forms ot a Republican county conven
tion: he has nominated his ticket for judicial and
legislative offices, and the ticket i> to be known as
the Republican ticket. The boss is in the saddle.
THE BOSS IN THE SADDLE.
Our people are not likely to be much alarmed by
what the Pan- Latin Congress does, or tries to do.
By well devised reciprocity treaties we can furnish the
South American countries with such inducements to
trade with us as no European country, whether
Latin or not, can equal, and we may safely leave our
commercial interests to the operation of such trea
ties. As for the possible alliance of all the Latin
races, that concerns Europe much more than us. f\n
the meantime, however, it will be worth while to
watch what is done when the congress meets in old
Madrid. "
The gathering of a congress of that kind at Madrid
coincident with the preparations now going on for a
Pan-American Congress to, be held in the City of
Mexico shows the conflicting ways in which run the
cu/rents of sentiment and of trade. The Pan-Latin
Congress can have hardly any other basis than one
of sentiment, while the Pan-American Congress will
be almost wholly a business affair. The one may tend
toward the formation of a military alliance, the other
would have no inclination to go further in such re
spect than a mutual resolve to uphold. the Monroe
doctrine.
A recent review of the subject says: "All Latin
America, comprising Mexico, is to be represented at
this congress in the Spanish capital. Portugal.,
prompted by the dread of seeing her still vast colo
nial possessions share the fate of those of the neigh
boring kingdom of Spain, has been quite as active in
the organization of the congress as the latter, while
Italy, and especially France, dp jiot attempt to con
ceal the sympathy which they entertain for the objects
which this Pan-Latin union has in view. Indeed
France, which has always claimed to be the leader
and representative of the Latin races, may yet endea
vor to put herself at the head of the movement, if for
no other reason than for that of increasing her impor
tance and prestige as one of the great powers of the
international concert."
WITHIN a few days there is to assemble at
Madrid, under the presidency of ex-Premier
Sagasta, an international congress which may
have developments of great importance to the world,
and, particularly to the United States. The gathering
is to be known as a "Pan-Latin" conference, and
there are reasons for believing the object is to form
an economic alliance against the English-speaking
nations. At any rate, it is fairly certain Spain is try
ing to recoup her losses in the war with us by ar
ranging some sort of commercial treaty with the
countries of South America that will procure trade
for her merchants and manufacturers, to the exclusion
of those of the United States and Great Britain.
A PAN-LATIN CONGRESS.
The nation -is now passing through a
crucial period beginning with the declara
tion of the war with Spain. Our Govern
ment and people have had to face new
conditions and to solve new problems. All
these the President now has well in hand.
Our own countrymen and the people of
other lands understand the policy of the
United States in regard to these impor
tant affairs. Any change of administra
tion before all these pending questions
are settled would be attended with more
or. less Inconvenience; but to change to a
radically different policy is to assume
much risk. If the Democrats mean what
they say their success this year will work
a complete reversal of the wise and
statesmanlike policy which has been in
augurated in the Philippines by President
McKinley, and new and costly troubles
would be sure to follow. Economy, justice,
good government and humanity â every
good Impulse and every just and righteous
consideration, demands that we do not
change the policy of the administration
until the country is past the danger point.
The Chinese troubles serve to emphasize
the importance of keeping trained men at
the helm until the storm is scattered.

were sold to or through syndicates of
speculators at enormous profits, and it
was expected by a great many people that
the next administration would continue
the samo ( policy. But the Republicans
were wiser. The war with Spain made
large expenditures necessary. Congress
authorized the borrowing of money and
$20O,COO,00O of 3 per cent bonds were sold
to our own people in sums of $25 up to
$.j0O. This is - the fourth year of the Mc-
Kinley administration and not a dollar

'former populist senator
WHO FAVORS McKINLBY'S
RE-ELECTION.
THE announcement that ex-Senator
"WY A. PeTfer of Kansas would take
the stump in this campaign under the
direction of the Republican National
Committee has created much com
ment among politicians of all parties.
Senator Peffer belonged to the old-cuard
of Kansas Populism and was sent by his
party to the United States Senate. In the
following statement he tells why he in
tends to giv* his support to the Republi
cans:
Ktlitor San Francisco Call: I am asked
why I -favor the re-election of President
McKinley. It is because after vehemently
urging on a war with Spain, and after
unbroken series of victories of our arms
on sea and land; after an energetic and
successful conduct of the war and an able
and patriotic management of the affairs
of government and a brilliant handling of
our foreign relations, adding glory and
prestige to our people and terminating In
a treaty placing us at the right of the
front rank of the" nations of earth, with
new and grave responsibilities attachingâ
after all these splendid achievements the
Democratic party, aided by its fusion al
lies, "has raised a hue and cry, charging
all manner of public crimes against the
administrationâ despotic use of power,
usurpation, fraud, corruption, perfidy,
calling on the nations to behold our na
tional shame and beseeching their, own
countrymen to aid them In their wicked
onslaught upon the good name, the honor
and dignity of. their own people.
I look on this brazen assault on the
honor of the republic as little less than
treason, and the success of the Republi
can party alone can prevent tho attain
ment of the end sought by the unholy
alliance. If there were no other reasons,
this alone would insure my vote for the
Republican candidate for the Presidency.
To my mind, and I have watched things
closely, the President's course from the
beginning of the war to the present lime,
has been remarkably free from mistakes,
lie has been vigilant, active, patriotic and
in all things American. In the govern
ment of the Philippines he has not only
followed the law and the precedents, but
he has done the work efficiently and hu
manely. He has treated the situation
just as Washington did In the Northwest
Territory, as Jefferson did in the Louis
iana purchase, as Monroe did in Florida,
as Jackson did in the Seminole country,
as Polk did In Mexico, New Mexico and
California, and as Lincoln did in the
States of the Southern Confederacy. All
the precedents are on the President's
side.
The Democrats say "the very existence
of the republic Is In issue," and they de
clare that to be the paramount issue of
the campaign. If that be true, the danger
In restoring their party to power is all
the greater.
Republic- ns with absolute unanimity

EDITORIAL
UTTERANCE
It happens, however, there are a good many other
organizations to have a vote on the subject. Among
them are the Women's Progressive Leagues, which
are said to be springing up all over Victoria and New
South Wales, and the Australian Natives' Associa
tion, which is said to have in Victoria alone a mem
bership of 18,000. Of the latter organization it is said:
"Other colonists sneer at it and envy the enthusiasm
of its members. Secretly, however, they admit that
unless a revolution is worked in politics or some new
league is formed round which both native-born and
English-born electors can rally; it will absolutely
dominate politics before another^ ten years have
elapsed."
It will be seen the Australians are about to enter
upon a struggle through which we have passed in
safety. The -contest, however, is to be complicated
with local issues. Thus it is noted that free trade is
associated in the minds of Australians with opposi
tion to certain reforms which the workingmen of the
country desire, and the labor parties therefore will in
most states give their support to protection.
The absolute free traders have been vanquished in
advance, and it appears that none of the "whole hog"
Cobdenites, as the Australians call them, will have
a following^ of considerable strength in any of the
states. The opposition to protection is to be waged
by advocates of "tariff for revenue only." There has
been formed an organization called the Australian
Free Trade and Liberal Association, and it has
adopted a platform declaring: "First â That the cus
toms and excise duties imposed by the common
wealth should be imposed only with a view to provide
for the wants of the treasury and in no way to give
support to any special industry at the expense of the
general community. Second â That the first federal
tariff should, so far as the exigencies of the severai
states will permit, embrace a number of duties some
what similar to those in force in Great Britain, with
the intention of as soon as possible establishing a free
breakfast table, any deficiency of revenue in such lat
ter case to be made up by direct taxation."
the colonies. Every item that is likely to find men
tion in the federal tariff has" been discussed with such
thoroughness that it is no exaggeration to say that
there are in Melbourne and Sydney at least twenty
men who would be able to submit a draft tariff which
would cover the needs of the principal protected in
dustries in the continent. The secrecy'which has sur
rounded the detailed work of the protectionists is the
testimony to their determination not to allow im
porters to crowd their warehouses a few weeks before
the initiation of the commonwealth and thus exploit
both the revenue and protected industries."
Are we incapable of projecting the metaphysical
into the physical life of our people? Theodore Parker
defined Christianity not as a dogma, but a life to be
lived. Surely we can't live it looting, and casting the
deeds of Timur and Gcnghiz in the shade, persuaded
thereto by Christian missionaries.
Can it be possible that the awful mistake has been
made of adopting a form of the religious idea,
oriental in its origin, without considering whether
occidental man can be adapted to it?
It is our fear that these things foretell the downfall
O! whdt has been called and practiced as Christianity.
The theory of Christianity does not appear in swAi
I ractice. The practice is on the same level as that
of Chinese paganism. If it be true that by their fruits
they shall be known, the two systems are twins, as
like as Castor and Poilux. The home people of the
Christian nations will not be long in making compari
sons, and when they do their allegiance to Christianity
will becofne more and more formal and perfunctory.
What the world seems to need now. more than any
thing else, is a Christianity that is Christian.
The authentic reports from China â not from Chi
nese but American sources, and from soldiers at that â
confirm the news of the awful outrages committed by
the sacramental armies of the Christian nations. To
the honor of our service, Americans have had no part
in these crimes. The Buddhist warriors ol Japan have
also acquitted themselves with conspicuous honor in
the same matter. General Fukushima, the Mikado's
Field Marshal in command in Chiua, has reported to
General Chaffee the most sickening and appalling
outrages, crimes unspeakable, bestial and beyond be
lief, committed upon hundreds of helpless Chinese
women by the anointed troopers of the Czar. Cleaving
and quartering the deflowered bodies of these poor
creatures has been the sport of the soldiery. And
the missionaries stani crying, "To that add the loot
of the Sacred City!" They rebuke our high-hearted
soidier. Chaffee, when he appeals to any nation rep
resented there by soldiers to join him in ending the
crimson carnival, anl only Japan responds!
The Beatitudes must be reversed to fit the cult of
the missionaries. Chapters of the Koran must be
transplanted into the New Testament, and the reli
gion of mercy and compassion, represented by the
beaming face of the Madonna, must be transformed
to one that forgives not its enemies, that loots and
murders, and the goddess Bellona must be placed in
its temples to typify iis spirit.
"Ye have heard that it hath been said an eye for an
eye an,d a tooth for a tooth, but I say unto you re
sist evil with evil, and whosoever shall smite thee on
the right cheek smite thou him also.
"I say unto you hate your enemies, curse them that
curse you. do evil to them that hate you.
"Therefore all things whatsoever you would that
men should not do unto you. do thou unto others."
"Therefore, if thou bring thy grift to the altar, and
there remembcrest that thy brother hath aught
against thee, leave then thy gift before the altar, go
thy way. first smite thy brother, bruise him from
crown to sole, take from him purse and scrip, and
then come and offer thy gift.
Surely it is time to rewrite the Sermon on the
Mount, that it may not rebuke those who profess Him
that preached it. Let it read, "Blessed are the un
merciful, for they shall obtain mercy."
'"Blessed are the strife-makers, for they shall be
called the children of God.
They believe that it is under supernatural guard.
It is piled high with treasure. The missionaries, un
like the soldier, want it looted. They want its trea
sure for the spoil of the Christian. They are the
promoters of an act repugnant to the laws of war.
offensive to the true soldier, revolting to morals, and
they are the teachers of Christianity to the heathen!
Now. the Sacred City is the inner one of the series
of cities of which Peking is composed. It is the
holy of holies. It is to them more than the threshing
floor of Oman, the Jebusite, was to the Jews.
The same dispatch says: "On the other hand, the
missionaries complain because the Sacred City has not
been looted also."'
The Associated Press announces that the American
General, Chaffee. is opposed to the outrages and the
looting at Tientsin and Peking, saying he "could not
have believed that any city 'would ever be given over
so completely to looters," and he earnestly desired the
co-operation of any nation to prevent this. That is
the feeling and opinion of a soldier and man of war.
But the spirit shown by the ordained class among
us and by the missionaries in many cases is something
widely different, and the nations concerned are con
fronted with the inquiry whether they have any func
tion in its propagation.
WE have had occasion to refer to many of the
militant expressions of ministers of the gos
pel as to the Chinese troubles! As a rule these
expressions have favored force and bloodshed, war
and its horrors, as missionary efforts, necessary to
open the Orient gates to Christianity. We have felt,
earnestly, that such a policy is antagonistic to the
spirit and teachings of Christianity. It is true that
they have some warrant in Jewish history and the
stories of the Old Testament, originating when Je
hovah was a tribal God, differing from other tribal
gods in being greater than they. But in the teachings
of Christianity the law of an eye for an eye and a tooth
for a tooth disappears not only, but is reprobated and
superseded by a gospel based primarily upon non
resistance and teaching that evil must be requited
with good.
This philosophy was in the world before the events
which fill the New Testament and makt the body of
Christian doctrine had occurred. It was taught by
Buddha, Confucius and by the Roman bondman,
Epictetus. The morals and ethics and the religion of
compassion, which have gentled the rude spirit of
man, were early among men. Christianity revived
them, spiritualized them, gave them a metaphysical
basis, and made them an enduring force in the world,
refined of all the dross of selfishness and passion. As
we have been taught, and to-day understand, this is
that Christianity which has been wrought out in many
nations.

against his wife, Susanna Paton, to quiet
title to their residence property on Shot

recently filed suit for divorce, alleging
cruelty. She claimed that her husband
was an astrologer and when the star3

the Harbor Commission this afternoon
the Southern Pacific will be represented
by Superintendent Fillmore, while Post
master Montague will represent Uncle

A Lively Time Expected.
The horse transport Flintshire arrived
fmm Manila yesterday. She was out In
Sunday's gale and as she was very light
everybody aboard had a lively time of it.
The "steamer came up In ballast. Soon
after her arrival the Government ship
Cyrus Wakeneld sailed for Seattle to load
coal for Manila and the Flintshire took
her placf at Folsom 2. The chances are
that the Flintshire will be retained to take
another load of horses to the Philippines.

the electrical fans gave out and three of

and neglected to oil the electric machine
that kept the fans going and supplied
the vessel with light. In consequence the

and ran out of the crankpin brasses.
There was no spare Babbitt metal on the

(Concluded.)
The fact that the Corcoran Gallery of
Art Is located In the nation's capital, in
Washington, gives It a prominence which
its contents do not altogether justify. The
walls are hung with works which, with j
perhaps the exception of a dozen can- j
vases, are by modern men, and there is j
no pretense of a comprehensive history of i
the different schools of art. Of these i
modern men not all aro satisfactory! and
a considerable proportion of the pictures
represents rather the fashionable art of
the dealers' shops of years past and the
meretricious if popular output of foreign
studios. But a number of the works ax* |
famous through reproduction and other
wise, and some of these are to be taken
seriously, while nearly all are interesting.
The "Passing Regiment," by the French
military painter. Edouard Detaille, is a
tine composition and wonderfully drawn
and painted; the "Helping Hand,"' by Re
nouf. has the touch of human nature and
Is skillfully done, while Muller's "Char
lotte Corday," with its sentimental and
pathetic figure, is much admired. Incom
parably the best thing here is a work
presented to the nation by the English
artist, George F. Watts, called "Love and j
Death." Watts is one of the great paint- j
ers of the century and ail his Â»work is j
marked by splendid qualities, intellectual i
as well as artistic.
The most notable of the native works
here include Frederick E. Church's "Ni
agara Falls." from the John Taylor John
son collection; Alexander Harrison's
large marine called "Twilight," a record
making picture, and one which has had a
strong: influence on the marine painters
all over the world, and Frederick A.
Brldgrcan's "Procession of the Sacred
Bull Apld-Oslris," a remarkable study of
the manners and customs of the ancient
Egyptians, and which caused the artist
to be elected to membership in, the Egyp
tological Society In Paris when it was
painted*. Of the painters of the middle
period in American art. let us say from
1S30 to 1S70. there are many examples of
portraiture, some of which is good, much
of which is mediocre, though this latter
frequently possesses historical interest
from the fact that the sitters have been
men who have achieved distinction or
prominence in one wav or another. By
the late Charles L. Elliott, an excellent
painter and popular In his day, there is a
portrait of the founder of the gallery,
with six other works. The late George
P. A. Healy, a worker who may be said
to have been more industrious than ar
tistic, has no leas than twenty-two por
traits, mainly of Presidents of the United
States. They are rather perfunctory in
execution, though they satisfy the public,
unfortunately, in looking superficially
lika the originals as they are remem
bered.
Thomas Cole, father of what is gener
ally referred to as the "Hudson River
School," has three works which fully rep
resent his talents, and there is a land
scape by the veteran Asher B. Durand
more or less in a similar nature. A single
example of Gilbert Stuart, five works by
Thomas Sully and two by Rembrandt
Peale complete the list of the earlier men.
The gallery is particularly rich in its col
lection of bronzes after work by the
greatest of all sculptors of animals, the
distinguished Frenchman. Antoine Louis
Barye. of which there are no less than
103. While these include a few portrait
busts and figures, they are mainly of ani
mals, wild beasts as a rule, wherein the
action, conception and craftsmanship are
all remarkable to the last degree. As
in most of the art museums or galleries',
the Corcoran contains a large collection
of plaster casts from the antique, the
renaissance or modern work, and these
are arranged in special groups, easy of
classification and study.
The Art Institute of Chicago completed
Its twenty-first year in May, 1900, and
must be reckoned as one of the most im
portant galleries in the country, contain
ing as it does a comprehensive collection
of pictures, both ancient and modern
with an excellent showing of native work
The building is a dignified, imposing
structure, standing on the lake front, op
posite Adams street. All told, there are
some 600 paintings and drawings, a collec
tion of antique casts, reproductions and
modern sculpture. Prominent among- the
pictures are the examples of modern
European art, particularly that of France
and its "Barblzon men." whose art has in
I the years past appealed so strongly to
American connoisseurs. Nearly all cf
these men are adequately represented,
and some of the more modern Impressions
are here as welL Of the modern Ameri
cans there are to be seen canvases by
AVJlliam M. Chase. Alexander Harrison.
Charles Sprague Pearce. W. L. Dannat
and David Neal. Prominent among th<Â»
various collections and gifts are those of
the Henry Field memorial, which con
tains forty-one canvases of the Barblzon
school; the Albert A. Munger collection,
mainly of the European schools, and the
fine Elbridge O. Hall collection of casts
of all sorts. These number 13S pieces.
In addition there is much American and
French historic sculpture, the HigKin
botham collection of Neapolitan bronze9
and some Egyptian and classical antiqui
ties.
Through the liberality of Andrew Car
negie the art gallery in connection with
the Carnegie Institute of Pittsburg was
founded In November. 1S05. and thrown
open to the public. By large donations on
his part a fund was established for the
purchase annually at the exhibitions hÂ»M
there and elsewhere, and a collection has
been made entirely of modern work that
Is representative of the latest achieve
ments in domestic and foreign art. Th*Â»
scope of this article doe3 not permit of
an analysis of all the collections, nor In
deed more than a passing mention of oth
ers than the most important institutions
of the country- There are museums In St.
Louis. Cincinnati, Detroit. Springfield and
Worcester. Ma?s., and Norwich, Conn., for
' example, while there are galleries in San
Francisco. Sacramento. Minneapolis. Buf
falo, Columbus. Savannah and elsewhere,
and many of the colleges have galleries
of pictures both entertaining and instruc
tive. If not always of the first importance.
We in America, In short, have arrived
at that stage of our national growth ami
progress when the material must share
i with the spiritual. Hitherto we have been
[ busy building empire, turning our whole
j time to questions ofidomestic and political
I economy, of Â¦ways and means, and thÂ»Â»
fight against the various enemies of a new*
civilization. If we are not yet rounded
out and perfected as a ration in our bo-
I cial. esthetic and political requirement!*.
I we are at least Â¦well on the road to their
j consummation, and our acknowledgment
of our latkings is the healthy sign of our
ability to make them good. Pictures and
other" works of art are the necessary
leaven to soften and ameliorate the rush
I and whirl of our restless and impetuous
American life. It Is to these public art
j palleries that the plain people will turn
, for instruction and plfa^ur?, and the more
; we have of them and the more complete
i they are the greater will be the return In
; the formation of good, healthy public
I taste. With this improvement Â¦will come
j the absolute demand for beautiful cities.
' good architecture, statuary and decora
tion of buildings, public and private. The
elevating Influence of good art may not
be computed, but Its tendency Is toward
municipal and national pu:lty, as well as
to the general Improvement of the race.

NEW YORK. Sept. 25.â To-day's rally in
prices was very clearly due to covering opera
tions by the bears who said stock last week
while the forced liquidation was going on.
There were signs already evident yesterday
that the professional bears had discounted the
decline, but the failure of a small Stock Ex
change firm and the distribution of selling j
orders skillfully arranged so as to appear to
come from last year's newly returned bear J
leader renewed confidence of the bears and j
their attack on the market late In the day {
was successful In weakening it again. They |
continued their efforts to further decline In j
price this morning and had good success for â¢
a time in the important Industrial stocks, {
notably Sugar, Tobacco End People's Gas, bu; j
the general list failed to respond as readily j
as yesterday to the weakness In these special
Btocks. The bears in consequence bought to j
cover all through the list ajid wrought some ;
eubstantial rallies. The declines in the special- j
ties â¢were mostly wiped out and Brooklyn Tran- J
sit and People's Gas were lifted a point over;
last night. ' Last week's liquidation apparently
outran the needs of the money markets and
the raids upon stocks were not successful in
dislodging Felling orders. Some timidity was j
induced by the bears on the possibility of sud- j
den favorable developments In some directions. I
The cut In the price of steel rails has not led i
in buying so far as known and railroad officials j
express dissatisfaction that the price was not
placed lower. When the railroad companies j
be?!n to place their contracts for the ccmin? ;
year, however, an Important effect is sure to |
be produced on the stocks of steel companies Â¦
generally. Wail street la on the alert also i
j for a settlement of the coal etrike, but there :
j was nothing to show the Imminence of any Â¦
I such event outside the fears felt by the bears. ;
j While the liquidation of last week seems to ;
j have met the immediate needs of the money !
i market the force making toward depletion of i
j New York reserves continues In undiminisned '
! force. Xo doubt, however, Is felt that any j
J widespread stringency in our domestic money
j market would bring prompt relief by gold lm-
I ports. i n view of our large outstanding credit3
j no one Supposes that the needs of mere specu- !
j lative holders of securities, however violent
! a rise in the loan rate they might effect, j
j would induce any movement of gold from I
I Europe under the circumstances attending this
i fall's money market there.

WHEATâ Liverpool and Paris showed little
change. New York declined. " Chicago opened
weak, with few buyers. The feeling was un
settled, belhs alternately weak and firm. The
firmness was caused by continued wet weather
In ths Northwest and a moderate export de
mand and the weakness by speculative liquida
tion. Monday's decline forced out the weak
holders. St. Louis and Kansas City receipts
were 175.000 bushels, and 250,000 were taken for
shipment, but the market was unresponsive.

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Sept. 25.â The wheat market
started out weak in the face of firmness at
Liverpool . and unimproved weather In the
Northwest, October at 77%@77'Ao. The heavi
ness was due to pressure by longs who were
after profits. Northwest markets were lower
and there was selling for that account and
for foreigners as well. October early dropped
to 77Hc and a recovery to 77%1xT7'.4c took place
on incorrect world's visible figures and the re
port making the increase only 1,844,000 bushels.
Later the tigures were corrected to make the
increase 4.634. 000 bushel3 ana the liquidation
again commenced. October turned weak and
sold to 7CTic, at which the market closed, lÂ»Â«t=
under yesterday.
There was a good cash demand for corn
and while the offerings were light the market
held firm. October closed He up at S99Â»Â®39Vic.
Oats were fairly active and easier. October
closed He lower at 21v4c.
Provision's ruled steady, with a fair volume
of business. A good cash demand was largely
responsible for the firmness, aÂ« hog receipts
were 400O over the estimate. The January op
tion is now the most active. January pork
closed 5c higher, lard 5c up and ribs 2'ic bet
ter.

were decided at the Golden Gate Fair As
sociation meet at Oakland track yester
day. The first named events caused con
siderable amusement for the booking fra
ternity because It was generally supposed
the drivers held a sort of family reunion
before each heat. As a consequence the
prices listed against the trotters and
pacers were extremely light. After the
racing it was rumored tne harness brigade
people were angry and might refuse to
play to-day. Of four runners sent to the
poet Articulate alone came home with the
merchandise, and at that the books only
enjoyed a light day.

Opera Well Acted and Shows the Re
sults Of Careful Re
hearsing'.
As a wMeome relief to the tragic gloom
of grand opera as we have so far heard
it at the Tlvoll Opera-house, "The Barber
of Seville" comes with its merry plot and
joyful ending.
It is well put on and aroused a large
enthusiasm, but It has not yet taken on
the whole the finished ensembleâ for this
old UosRinl opera is difficult, indeed, in
that regardâ that It will show later on in
the week. And yet in some places, the
big septet, for example, the ensemble ia
excellent, showing a careful and conscien
tious rehearsal.
.Ferrari wins another triumph as Klg
aro. His natural bent is evidently for
comedy, and his barber Is as supple, talk
ative, plausible, good-naturedly meddle
some a knave as one could wi'sh to see.
The "l^argo al Factotum" received a
triple Fncore and was sung in fine bragga
docio fashion. Russo's role, the mock he
roic hero, Almarina, fits him like a glov*
and is sung and acted with an anctuous
appreciation of its possibilities. Nlcollnl
scored a distinct success as the cadaver
ous shovel-hatted and Koutaned Don Ba
slllo. and Gustavo Panlzza did excellent
work as Dr. Bartolo, from an acting
standpoint. He does not happen to pos
sess a votce, but it was hardly missed.
Repetto. of course, sings Rosina, and
her delicate, airy-fairy fooling and lovely
vocalization show her at her sweetest,
and the good work of Mr. Newbauer In
the flute obligate to Repetto's "Singing
Lesson" solo must be highly commended.
Poiltlnl makes the most of the housekeep

A few days ago a San Francisco morning pa
per had occasion to criticise the action of cer
tain university students who have a propensity
tor coming home on the last boat. We are
very sorry to be compelled to notice this occur
rence editorially. We have all along consid
ered it our provlncp not to meddlo with the
private, affairs of the students but to deal only
with those thlnts that nre of vital Interest to
us all. Wo liitve passed ovr-r again an<l ayrnln
miFdeeds perpetrated by university students,
not wishing to occupy the attention of out
readers with such recitals, and doubting very
much If any good could come from such edi
torial comment.
At last, however, forbearance has ceased to
be a virtue. The time has come when some
thing must bo done by some one to remedy
As reported by Editor Dickson these col
legians were guilty of breaches of de
corum not calculated to impress witnesses
with the refinement or cultun of the
rioters. . x .
The comment is under the caption,
"College Traitors.". It is In full as fol
lows:
Such Is the tenor of the criticism which
Edward A. Dlckson, editor-in-chief of the
Californian. stirred the student body
with this morninp. Hl3 text wus the nar
rative of some disorderly conduct of sev
eral university men on a streetcar.
BERKELET. Sept. 23. â Student?
and faculty of the University of
California were startled to-day
by the appearance in the Cali
fornian, the 'college dally, of an
editorial blast upon the alleged miscon
duct of student carou&ers. who were held
up In bold type as "intoxicated hoodlums"
and disgraces to the university, whose
name they had flaunted as title to the
right trÂ» conduct themselves In public In
most disreputable fashion. The editorial
breathed hot denunciation and threatened
personal disprace upon offenders who
should be again brought before the bar
of public opinion because of their rowdy
ism.
The Instances are so rare where college
publications have pursued Mich a course
asÂ» the Californian did to-d^y that the edi
torial has been the one topic of discus-
TVe nre extremely sorry to have been com
pelled to notice this deplorable Incident. bÂ»tf
it is only Just t" the bettÂ»r clans of students
that the worM know that we do .r.ot approve
of such doing?. We object to be Judgred b7
the standard set by these disreputable mem
bers of our body.
These men are perhaps the hope of some
father and mother who may have denied them
fpIvps to give their sons opportunities forhlcher
education. In perfect candor we can say they
nre gettlnff it. How would such fellows feel
to have the Californian publish their names?
Some day. if these insults to the name of our
university do not\ cease, a list of names may
appear in these columns.
Tiring of insulting defenseless women, they
turned their attention to a Chinaman. They
took possession of his hat and proceeded to
have a good time as only intellectual college
men can. This, too, wns all right, ns he was
only a heathen and the heathen should, in the
nature of things, be enlightened as to all as
pects of Christian civilizationâ and especially
the ways of our Institutions of learning.
We refer to a Fpeeiflc instance. On last Sun
day night two drunken university students
boarded a Telegrranh avenue car In Oakland.
On this car happened to be two ladles from
Berkeleyâ a very old lady and her daughter.
These university studentsâ may their cheeks
record the blushâ so far forgot themselves as to
use ohsceno language in the presence of these,
lnfl!<Â«Â«. Kven more, they applied opprobrious
erlthets to the women, who, to the shame ot
a cowardly conductor, were forced to endure
puch insult. Of course we can excuse this as
the briys were "college fellows out for a good
tlmÂ»." Rf-Mdes. th(>y were drunkâ a highly
puitahle condition for colleee men.
abuses that are becoming too flagrant to ba
bearable. When ladles cannot ride on the late
cars from Oakland without being: Insulted by
drunken college toughs; when an Inoffensive
Chinaman Is maltreated by men openly boast
lne of their university standing as an excuse
for their misdeeds; when night is made hideous
by the shouts and obscene language of intox
icated hoodlums, students of the University of
California. It seems to us common decency de
mands that something must be, done. Such
actions must bear the mark of student con
demnation.
Upon the ground that he was unin
formed upon the facts President Wheeler
declined to express an opinion upon the
publication.
The editorial was all risht. This is an affair
which students should deal with. They can do
more than the faculty. Men who brln? dis
prace on the colleee should be known. Stu
dents should not protect them by keeping their
names from the public. They should be known
and put out of colleee.
If the acts were as represented In the edi
torial then the comment was all right and
timely, but I have not yet been able to con
vince myself that it was absolutely correct.
I have inquired around among the students and
could find rii? proof that the assertions were
absolutely true. If the editorial is exasperated
then it is In the wrong according to the amount
of exaggeration.
D. A. Gordenker, editor of the Occident,
the university weekly, said:
Although the editorial has caused widespread
comment the students recognize that It Is true.
Even the fellows themselves do not condemn
the stand the Californian has taken, but ac
knowledKe that they were in the wronff. I
believe that for the protection ,of the name of
the university and the reputation of the. stu
dents the drunkenness of a certain few
college men should be openly condemned.
These men who go about on trains, boats and
streetcars in an intoxicated condition and boast
that they arc from the university do much to
hurt us. The specific case mentioned in the
editorial is an actual happening;.
Ralph Fisher, president of the Associat
ed Students, said:
slon. Many of the students were free lÂ«
say that the criticism was Just so far as
It might be applied to the lapse or wrong
doing of an individual, but It was said
that there would be grave doubts of the
expediency of the bitter arraignment of
the students because of the general tip
pllcation that might be given to It.
Editor Dlckson justifies the editorial
and Its publication upon the declaration
that the actions of which he complained
were actual occurrences and that he had
knowledge of the truth of his published
statements. Here is what the editor said
to-day:

ASSESSOR DODGE, WHO. IN
VIOLATION' OF HIS PI.EDOE.
SUED FOR FEES.
SUPERIOR JUDGE SEAWELL,
decided yesterday that Assessor
Washington Dodge was quite
within his rights under the law
when he flouted one of the cardi
nal rules of the charter and set out to get
everything nominated In the bond. The
case In which his Honor handed down his
decision was the suit brought by Dodge
against the city for 15 per cent of the to
tal poll tax collections. The charter pro
vides that the Assessor shall receive an
annual salary of $4000 In full compensa
tion for all his services and that he shall
take no fees of any sort whatever for any I
service. The Political Code, pursuant to
a proviso of the State constitution,
awards to the Tax Collector a commis
sion of 15 per cent of all poll tax collec
tions. It was the decision of the court
that the charter could not repeal a section
of the Political Code when made on the
lines of the constitution, and that Dodge
In collecting poll taxes acted as an officer
of the State. Decision was given in his
favor accordingly.
It will be pleasing news for Dodge that
the city will not appeal from Seawell's
decision, and that the amount for which
he has obtained judgment will be paid
him forthwith by the Treasurer. In all
there is due him something like $15,000.
but that amount cannot be figured as
overlarge when there ia considered the
pain It must have caused the acquisitive
Assessor to puncture so profitable a hole
In the charter. As Is well known. Dodge
stood sponsor when the charter was
brought Into being. During the last cam
paign he contributed largely to his elec
tion by his Iron-bound promises to pro
tect and maintain the city's new scheme
of government In its entirety. He not
only talked about It loudly, but he hired
a man and a half dozen blackboards and
stumped the city painting Impressionistic
pictures In chalk of the other things he
would do and had done.
Judge Seawell In summing up his deci
sion spoke as follows:

Are Within the Law.

Two accidents happened yesterday
morning, one to a painter and the other
to a roofer, both of a serious nature.-
Martin Flynn, a painter employed by
Gercke & Weber, was painting a house
at Sacramento and Mason streets, near
the roof. He grasped .hold of a rotten
molding to support himself and the mold
ing gave way, precipitating him to the
ground. He struck on a balcony In his
descent, which broke the effect of his
fall. He was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital, where it was found that his left el
bow joint was badly fractured and his
back contused. He was also suffering:
from the shock.
John MIchelson, 164 Boyce street, was
shingling the roof of a house on Cook
Btreet. near Geary. The roof was slippery
and he slid off to the ground. He was
taken to the Receiving Hospital and It
was found that he had 'sustained severe
contusions of the back and hips and pos
sible internal Injuries.

The work of securing a jury to try the
Letour will contest was begun before
Judpe Troutt yesterday. Felix Latour,
whose will Is now under fire, died several
months ago at a Lake County ranch, the
property of Caroline Ford. After his death
Caroline Ford presented the bankbooks
and vouchers of the deceased, which had
been transferred to her, and offered a will
for probate, in which she was named as
sole devisee to an estate valued at $20,000.
Narcisse and Joseph Latour, brothers,
and Malvina Latour. a sister of the de
ceased, filed one contest to the will, and
Catherine Latour, decedent's widow, filed
another. All of the contestants charge
Caroline Ford with undue Influence. They
Bay that the deceased was stricken with
apoplexy while working in her field.
Though unable to speak or move, his mind
remained sufficiently clear to dictate the
will, which the contestants allege the
devisee coerced the deceased Into exe
cuting. Caroline Ford, they say, telephoned
to Bartlett Springs for a doctor and a
lawyer at the fame time, and later, while
Latour was still living, telephoned for an
undertaker.
The taking of testimony will probably
begin this afternoon.

WTJ&EMAN KILLED BY
AN ELECTRIC SHOCK
In Golden Gate Park, midst flowers and trees,
"Where bountiful nature Is peer.
In a temple remindful of ancient Greece
Stood a kind-hearted, proud pioneer.
His words new 'firmly from heart and lip:
/With the presentation of the beautiful
token the formal ceremonies closed and
the guests were ushered into, the dining
room. There for hours revelry, good-fel
lowship, toasts and merriment ruled. The
first toast was spoken by Charles
Bundschu and was dedicated to Claus
Spreckels. It was as follows: ;
The waves rolled Into the Golden Gate
On the ninth day of September,
Each pushing on with Its dashing; mate.
And murmuring: "Yea, we remember!"
Their white-winged crowns spread over the
' beach.
Rushed forward and broke through thÂ« surf,
Their potent arms with an eater reach
.Stretched out to the eand lined turf.
.The ocean's surging, restless expanse
; Sent Its miehtlest waves to the coast.
They whirled and sprayed a jubilee danco,
And their spokesman offered a toast.
He' reared his head throueh the bluish mist,
UDliftlnsr a -wonderful shell.
He held it aloft in his powerful fist
And â¢ wavellke now roee and then fell.
Near the cliff whore the seals in sunshine bask.
The shell like a bowl In his hand.
He" raised his brow and fulfilled his task,
, And spoke with his face to the land:
"All hail and all bliss to this wonderful shore
'That hinders and checks our . pace,
Agrreetlne to them that In days of yore
Have struggled and not lost their race!
A greeting to them that firmly and bold
Linked ' their fate with "the setting sun.
A greeting to them that 'to have and to hold*
Have battled and labored and won!
The years rolled by, half a century passed} v
Success came through struggles and throes.
From dunes and sand drifts in glory at last
, The Queen of Pacific arose.
To the men that stood in the foremost line,
That conquered the far western coast,
I raise this chalice â¢ with seafoam wine,
I pledce them a Jubilee toast!" â¢".--".;
Ha flrank and sank to the depths below
And a roaring shout a?nd a : cheer
Broke forth from the waves, lined up In a row:
"California, all hail, we are near!
California, thy future lies here!".
On the 9th day of September, in the year
of nineteen hundred. In commemoration oi
the fiftieth anniversary â the golden jubilee
âof the Statehood of California.
The board of directors, on behalf of the
Merchants' Association, resolved, that
heartfelt appreciation and gratitude be
hereby tendered to our fellow member,
Claus Spreckels, for this notable evidence
of civic patriotism and philanthropy.
MERCHANTS" ASSOCIATION.
F. W. DOHRMANN, President.
J. RICH'D FREUD, Secretary.
CLAUS SPRECKELS,
Organized for civic improvement and
adornment, greets with profound gratifi
cation the erection of the magnificent
temple of music in Golden Gate Park and
its presentation to "the people of Califor
nia" by
SAN FRANCISCO.
rest from toil. You have added a new
feature to our city and you are entitled
not alone to our gratitude, but to that
of generations unborn. Accept this sliver
tablet as the token of the gratitude of
the people."
When Mr. Grant had finished Claus
Spreckels stepped forward to respond, but
he could not. He was overcome with
emotion and only with difficulty said:
"Gentlemen, I thank you. I thank you
deeply for what you have done and all I
can say is that you honor me by being
In my home."
The tablet was then presented to him.
This silver tablet Is a remarkably fine ex
ample of workmanship in silver. It is
composed of a solid silver slab, twelve by
seventeen inches, set upon a background
of solid ebony and Inclosed in a morocco
leather, silk-lined case. The detail of de
sign and engraving Is most beautiful, but
the work which is of special Interest is the
entirely new and original effect accom
plished by the application of photography
to the silversmith's art. The portrait of
Mr. Spreckels and the view of the music
pavilion are photographed and etched di
rectly upon thÂ« surface of the silver tab
let, the result being as absolutely true
and correct as when done by the ordinary
method upon paper, and as Indestructible
as the metal itself. These original char
acteristics of the beautiful tablet give to
it more than ordinary importance and aid
in the completion of this graceful tribute.
Upon the tablet Is the following Inscrip
tion, the quoted words being those which
were spoken by Claus Spreckels when the
music pavilion was presented:^
"I have never wished for any other
home nor longed for anything on earth
that California could not give.
"Loving California as I do and being
grateful for the many benefits that have
accrued to me, I desire to transfer this
monumental structure as a memorial ot
my citizenship to the people of Califor
nia."
THE MERCHANTS' ASSOCIATION OF
A SCENE without precedent in the
history of San Francisco was en
acted last night at the Van Ness
avenue home of Claus Spreckels
when the officers, directors and
ex-directors of the Merchants' Associa
tion, in company with other men of prom- I
inence, assembled to welcome Claus
Spreckels home and to pay a tribute to
him whom they chose to call the foremost
citizen of San Francisco. Never before
In the history of the city has such a
tribute been paid to a private citizen. The
words of welcome were generous. The
token, which accompanied them and
which Claus Spreckels was asked to pre
serve as a mark of appreciation for his
civic patriotism and generosity, was a
magnificent silver tablet commemorating
his gift of the music stand to Golden
Gate Park.
The spokesmen of the donors said that
they considered It their duty to give this
testimonial to Claus Spreckela. As a
Merchants' Association, they were organ
ized, they said, for civic improvement and
adornment, and they felt bound to recog
nize in some suitable manner the gift of
the splendid music stand in Golden Gate
Park. It was this purpose which inspired
them and gave justification to their ap
pearance last night at the Spreckels
home.
The officers, directors and former direc
tors of the Merchants' Association as
sembled at 8 o'clock at the home of the
president, F. W. Dohrmann. From there
they went In a body to the home of Claus
Spreckels. The presentation was made in
the brilliantly lighted reception hall to
which the master of the house was called
to hear the praises In his honor and to
receive the token of good will which had
been prepared.
F. W. Dohrmann was the first to speak.
Addressing Claus Spreckela, he said:
"When a party of gentlemen enter a
man's home they must tell why. Our
mission here is that of simple, practical
business men Inspired to come here to you
and to express our sentiments and those
of our organization for what you, in civic
patriotism, have done for San Francisco.
As a Merchants" Association we have
tried to keep alive those purposes which
contribute to the improvement and beauty
of our city. We have thought of our
parks, our neighbors' houses, our streets
and our city as of our own home.
"We have done what we could to beau
tify r.nd improve them, and perhaps we
have bullded better than we knew. And
in our efforts we have known and have
seen your civic pride and patriotism. To
night, therefore, as simple, plain, business
men. In Jtehalf of 1200 of our members and
in the name of our civic pride we greet
you as the foremost citizen of San Fran
cisco. W T e ask to pay our tribute, to wel
come you home and to accept from you
your be6t, most glorious gift to San
Francisco.
Mr. Dohrmann then called tupon Frank
J. Symmes to deliver the formal address
of welcome.
"It Is my personal pride," said Mr.
Symrae?, "to welcome you home. I am
not given to fulsome flattery nor to fool
ish praise and If I were I know you, Mr.
Spreckels, too well not to know that you
would accept neither. The "Merchants'
Association represents good government
and good citizenship and we recognize in
you one of the foremost of our citizens.
It is our duty, therefore, to tell you that
we appreciate what you have done for
your adopted city. That you have given
comfort, livelihood, employment to thou
sands of men we know. That your enter
prise has helped to build up and beautify
our city Is our boast. And when we ex
press our appreciation of what you have
done we tell what is in our hearts.
"We know also that . those who have
been public spirited In San Francisco have
not received recognition for what they
have done and we seek, therefore, in wel
coming you homo to' pay you our tribute.
To do so is a delight to. us' and in behalf
of those I represent and for myself I pray
that your days may be long in the land
and that your years may be crowned with
happiness."
President . Dohrmann then called . upon
Joseph D. Grant to speak a few words in
presenting the tablet.
"It Is a great pleasure to me," said Mr.
Grant, "to present to you this silver
tablet as a token of our appreciation for
your splendid gift to the people, not
alone of San Francisco, but to the people
of the State. You have set a glorious ex
ample to men of public spirit. You have
taught visitors to us that they must look
to our art, to our public beauties, not our
Chinatown, as objects of Interest.
"The arts In every land follow the
march of commerce and no man in our
country has done more for the supremacy
of commerce than yourself. Your gift to
the Golden Gate Park combines the beau
ties of art, music and the varied charms
of landscape. It is a tribute to your taste,
your public spirit and your generosity.
Allow me then again to thank you and
In those thanks I speak the thought of
thousands who make Golden Gate Park
their scene of recreation, pleasure and
Colonel Jackson married in Cincinnati,
in ISC", a Ivliss Ann Hooper of Kentucky,
and nine children were the result of the
alliance. Of these the following named
survive him: Charles H. Jackson, an at
torney at law in the Parrott building; An
drew Ja.ekson, manager of the Napa Soda
Springs; Mrs. A. li. Small; John P. Jack
son Jr., who is in the insurance business;
G. H. T. Jackson, local manager of the
Kapa soda business; Miss L.ucy Jackson,
Percy II. Jackson, now in Europe, and
Raymond C. Jackson. Xo date has yet
been set for the funeral, as Andrew Jack
eon is on a hunting trip in Trinity Coun
ty, and an effort is being made to com
mur.ica.te with him.
He was born in Cleveland, Ohio, in
March. 1&33, and went through the com
mon schools of that city, after which he
went to Cincinnati, where he studied law
with Hon. Bellamy Storer. When ha
viri.t into active practice it was as an as-
Boclate of Benjamin Harrison, Governor
Hoadley and other big men of the time,
ana his ia.w business soon brought him
much wealth. In lbC2 he fought in the
Army of the Cumberland and later was
on detached service under General Grant.
In isC he went to Europe, where he float
ed th* bonds of the California Pacific
Railway, and later the building of that
road brought him to California. After It
had been sold to th.' Central Pacific Rail
road he built the Stockton and Copper
oiiohs Railroad upon his own resources
and then constructed the Stockton and
Vjsai.a branch. These roads, too, were
bjugm by the Central Pacific.
Jackson's political life began when he
Btuxnped the East for Abraham Lincoln
in company with Grant's father. General
Saexnuui. Bcboyler Coiiajc and other noia-
Lie fcpe-akers of that day. In 1&64 he re
ceived the unanimous nomination of the
Republicans for Governor of Kentucky,
in use iate seventies Colonel Jackson pur
chased the- Evening Post in this city and
for s:x \eais gave it his personal atten
tion and put it on a paying basis. |vt the
taint time he was spending thousands of
doiiars in the development of his prop
erty in Xapa County. When Harrison
went into the White House he appointed
Colonel Jackson as Sub-Treasurer in this
city, and President JMcKinley later ac
knowledged his party services by asking
him to accept the honorable position he
held at the time of his death.
Colonel Jackson was one of the best
known public men in the country and his
ability as an orator and profundity as a
thinker brought him in demand time and
again to lead in the eloquence of Repub
lican campaigns. He was at one time law
associate of ex-President Benjamin Har
rison and a friend of General Grant, who
wanted to name him as one of the mem
bers of his Cabinet when he was elected
to the Presidency. He has been lawyer,
statesman, politician in the truest sense,
& promoter and builder of railways, and
has aJso given much of his time to the
development of the natural resources-Â»of
the West. His Napa Soda Springs in
>.apa County yielded him a fortune in a
very few years. It has been said of him
that he made a success of everything he
undertook.
Culonel Jackson's death was not unex
pected and all of the members of his large
family but two were at his bedside when
the end came. He had been in falling
health for some years past, but was al
ways of a cheerful disposition and re
mained hard at work at the multitudinous
duties which were his almost to the week
of his death. It was not until a week
iigo that he would admit his condition to
be serious. Those who knew him and
worked with him in the Federal offices
realized his illness and repeatedly urged
him to give up his work and rest. He
ilnally acceded to their demands by going
to his country place at Kapa Soda Springs,
but while there worked night and morn
ing upon the speeches which he proposed
delivering during the present campaign,
in which he was deeply interested. Re
turning to this city, he was compelled to
take to his bed, and his family physician,
Dr. Max Rothschild, was in almost con
stant attendance upon him after that
time.
Colonel John P. Jackson, Collector of
the Port of San Francisco, died at 5:30
o'clock last evening at Mount Zion Hos
pital, where earlier In the day he had
suffered a surgical operation In the last
hope of savins his life from the compli
cation of maladies that threatened him.
Â¦Was a Man of Splendid Attainments
and Stood High in Coun
cils of Republican
Party.
Succumbs to a Complication
of Maladies That Long
Threatened Him.

There is another side to the topic of
tea In which the local wholesalers are
concerned. The Tientsin caravan route
from the Tientsin district to Russia has
been closed by reason of the outbreak of
the Bcxers. No longer are the trains of
patient camels carrying the fragrant herb
to the subjects of the Czar. For centuries
the Tientsin route has been the one pur
sued ty the tea caravans. Transporta
tion by sea has been too roundabout for
the Russians. Now their supplies are cut
off. They are a great tea-drinking people.
"Polly put the kettle on and we'll all have
tea" is sung by countless Russian fire
sides In the Russian language. The people
will have tea. Perhaps they will have
supplies fqrwarded from the United
States and Great Britain, which have been
able to get Chinese teas freely. That is
the side of the story that appeals to com
mercial people. But "Aunt Sarah" is
short 4,400,000 pounds of Japan teas this
year.
"There is," continued Mr. Platt, pursu
ing the subject, "a great shortage in the
Japan tea crops. The first crop showed a
shortage owing to drought of 30,000 piculs,
and a picul is 133 1-3 pounds. The second
and third crops were also largely cut off
by lack of rain and there Is now an esti
mated total shortage in the supply of Ja
pan tea for the year 1900 of not leas than
33,000 piculs. The prices for Japan teas
have advanced very largely, running from
3 cents to 5 cents per pound, or from 10 per
cent to 25 per cent. There are Congous
and other Chinese teas, of course, but the
taste for Japan teas has largely possessed
the people. It is difficult to alter one's
palate."
"Aunt Sarah's teapot." said Charles
B. Platt, reflectively, "may not be filled
to her entire satisfaction In the near
future." By. the name of "Aunt Sarah"
Mr. Platt typified all nice old ladies who
drink tea and have cultivated a fine and
discriminating taste in that line. Mr.
Platt knows all about tea in his two
capacities of United States tea expert and
vice president of J. A. Folger & Co.
Therefore, he is able to estimate the ex
tent of the calamity that may befall the
ardent followers of various fragrant
brands.

At this morning's meeting of the Board
of Education the principal business trans
acted will be the appointment of Dr. Mag
nus and the assignment of four additional
teachers from, the substitute list to classes
to be formed in the Everett, South End,
Halght Primary and Buena Vista schools.
The latter will be selected In the order of
their original appointment except where
adverse reports have been filed by princi
pals, says Chairman Mark.
Chairman Mark takes issue with the
Board of Examination, which holds that
certificates may be granted only upon its
recommendation. Mark quotes chapter 3
of article VII of the charter relating to
the duties of the School Board in support
of his contention. It says that it has
power to grant, to renew and for the
causes mentioned in section 1 subdivision
2 of this chapter to revoke teachers' cer
tificates. Again section 1 says the board
shall have power to employ such teachers
and persons as may be necessary to carry
into effect its power and duties. Nothing
in this section, however, shall be con
strued as preventing the board from re
moving teachers holding only special cer
tificates.
Secretary Kingsbury stated that while
Dr. Magnus does not need a certificate in
his capacity of physical director, the as
sistants under his charge will certainly
be compelled to furnish proper credentials
or take an examination on the subject
which they will teach. He says that the
Board of Examination took the view that
as Dr. Magnus would not assume direct
charge of a class his appointment is leg
al, even though he does not possess a cer
tificate.
At a meeting of the examiners yester
day Superintendent "Webster and Depu
ties Kingsbury, Jordan and Howard came
to the conclusion that a special certificate
â¢would not be required in the case of Dr.
Magnus, because in his capacity of direc
tor he will not teach a class in the strict
sense of the phrase, but will supervise
the teaching of the branch by special or
regular teachers as may be determined by
the School Board.
The City Board of Examination has re
considered Us determination announced In
these columns yesterday to oppose the
appointment by the Board of Education
of Dr. Max Magnus to be director of phys
ical culture In the School Department be
cause he does not possess properly accred
ited credentials.
