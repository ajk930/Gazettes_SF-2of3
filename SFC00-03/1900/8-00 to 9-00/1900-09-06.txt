LOUD THE CHOICE
FOR CONGRESS FEOM
THE FIFTH DISTRICT
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SANTA CRUZ, Sept. 5. â The work of the district conventions was concluded to-night. There were no serious contests ex
cept in the Second District. .
In this district the victory of S. D. Woods of San Joaquin County created a great surprise among the delegates. It was thought early in the
day that Colonel E. A. Forbes of Yuba would be nominated for Congress in this district, and that the latter, failed to secure the coveted plum was due
principally to the untiring efforts of F. E. Dunlap and Arthur JLevinsky of San Joaquin County, who from the outset labored to secure the nomination for
their friend. Six ballots were necessary to decide the contest. Nevada County was first to break and join Woods' standard and the delegates from Butte quickly
followed, and the nomination of San Joaqnin's candidate was assured. Although the contest was a spirited one, it ended harmoniously.
Following are the results by districts:
CALL. HEADQUARTERS. SANTA
CRUZ. Sept. 5.â "Heretofore and
prior to the last State conven
tion," said Arthur L/evinsky, in
calling the Second Congressional
District Convention to order, "I was the
the chairman of this district. As such it
was my duty to call the convention to
order. At the last State convention which
nominated delegates to the national con
vention there were new committees and
chairman appointed. The chairman ap
pointed is not present to-r.ijrht. There
was no vice chairman appointed. At the
request of the representatives of the va
rious candidates before this convention I
have been asked to call you to order. The
request was made by Senator Cutter,
Judge J. M. Walling and Senator Pres
ton. I have not. . been requested by the
San Joaquin delegates, as our county rep
resents the Interests of S. D. Woods. If
it will be your pleasure, I will now call
this convention to order.
"Gentlemen of the convention, nomina
tions for temporary chairman are novr In
order."
Frank J. Solinsky of Calaveras nomi
nated Senator E. C. Vcorheis and Dr. J.
W. Harvey of Butte placed Frank B. Ryan
of Sacramento in nomination. The con
vention proceeded to vote on the candi
dates, and Mr. Ryan simplified 'matters
by tvithdrawlns in favor of Mr. Voor
hets.
The next order of business was the
election of a temporary secretary, and
Judge Adams named Frank D. Ryan.
That popular delegate was elected by ac
clamation before he could refuse the of
fice, and when called on made an excel
lent speech thanking the body for the
honor conferred upon him. "We can con
gratulate our President," he said "for re-,
moving one great obstacle to Republican
success in this district." V
His allusion to Congressman de Ydes
created much laughter.
At the close of his remarks the follow
ing committee on credentials was ap
pointed: Judge Adams of El Dorado,
Frank Frntes of lone. James Weldon of
Butte. F. J. Sollnsky of Calaveras. W. T.
Elliott of Mono, Harvey lioone of Inyo,
C. F. McGlashan of Nevada, B. B. Dem

F. E. Dunlap of Snn Joatiuin. H. P. Har
r'son of Suttcr. T. A. Hender of Tuol
umne and W. M. Cutter of Yuba.
The following committee on order of
hi'f>'rc?s and pcrmarent organization was
appointed by the chairman: Harold T.
Power. John F. Davis. W. R; Hall, Ar
thur I*. Levinsky and C. N. Porter.
A temporary recess was taken, and on
reconvening the committees reported.
Judge Adams, chairman of the commit
tee on credentials, read the list of dele-
Kates, and at its conclusion asked for the
adoption of the report. Chairman Power
repd the report of the committee on order
of business antl permanent organization,
which was adopted.
Senator Davis in an eloquent speech
nominated Harold T. Power of Placer
County as Presidential Elector. Judson
Krusie, formally nominated Dr. G. L.
Simmons of Sacramento and C. F. Me-'
Glashan placed John F. Kidder of Ne
vada in nomination. Charles , Swlsler
nbly seconded the nomination -f Air.
Power. Nominations having closed, a
roll call of the counties resulted in the
following vote: Power 63, Kidder 24, Sim
mons 26.
Mr. Power was announced the victor
and Hon. John F. Kiddrr was selected as
alternate Presidential Elector of the Sec
ond District.
The next, order of business was the
nomination of a candidate for Congres3.
F. E. Dunlap of San Joaquln obtained
the floor andln a short but able speech
he placed the name of S. D. Woods before
the. convention. When the anplause had
subsided. Senator Cutter of Tuba placed
his fellow townsman. Colonel E.A.Forbes.

Before it assembled, before a temporary officer was chosen or a rollcall euk
geyted. The <"all toid in absolute detail all that it would do. Its officers were
named by this paper before they were chosen. Its plans, resolutions, policy, plat
form and candidates worÂ» sriven to-day by The Call before ja maicrity of the
delegates |cnÂ«w tho locality of the hall In which they were to meet.
In only one instance wai the prediction of this paper not verified, and that was.
in th* Second Congressional District, where the railroad slate was broken and the
railroad candidate for Conrrrss. K. A. Forhes. was defeated by S. D. Woods. Dur
!r.s the fight in this district Edward Conroy was an active worker In the conven
tion, striving in every possible way to obtain votes for Forbes. His chagrin was
vrltten on his face. It was one of the most pleasurable Incidents of the conven
tion.
ACCURACY OF THE CALL'S FORECAST.
THERE IS LITTLE LEFT TO DO.
i he Congressional conventions having finished their labors,
very 1 ttle is left for the general body to do. It will meet to
morrow and will ratify wh.it the seven districts have done, and
it will then elect two Presidential Electors-at-large. whose names
were announced to-day by'The'Call. A platform" will be adopt
ed and probably at noon the convention will adjourn.
he committee on platform and resolutions has had seriou3
business before it to-day. Members of the committee were
tj to attend various district conventions and were unable to eive to tha
platform that consideration which it was hoped it would receive. The docu
ment will not be completed, therefore, until to-morrow. In order to expe
dite matter? the following sub-committee was appointed: Judtre F. M. An
gdlotti of the First Cor-irre^ior.al District. F. J. Solinsky of the Second Con-
Kre?siora1 District. Dr. Georsre C. P.irdee of the Third Congressional Dis
trict. Charles Franklin of the Fourth Congressional District. W. S. Wood of
the Fifth Cori-resHonal District. T. \V. McKinley of the Sixth Congressional
District, and Dr. Chester Rowell of the Seventh Congressional District.
This corr.T-.ittee made some progress to-day, but was unable to finish its la
bors.
IMPORTANT PLATFORM SUGGESTIONS.
Three important suerfre^tions other than thoÂ«=e presented to-dav in the out
:ir.c of the platform bv The Call were made. These ?ujrsrcstions mav or may
e !rr-".rporat<v1 In the platform, but the probability is that they will be. One
in oamr-st advoracy of an increased State appropriation for the 1'nlverpity
Sforr.'.n. to be derived from taxation which shall not be general. The second
trpp irirrpasod State l^erislation in behalf of irrigation, and the third, a most
.t r<-'-ommer,.1atlon. demands that all shipbuilding for the National Gov
errrr, t a.^ifmod to this State be made In Federal shipyards under Federal su
lon. It is probable also that an effort will be made to incorporate In the
p'atform an indorsement 'of San Pedro harhor.
Tnie 1 their policy the Herrln-Crimmirs-Kclly contingent insisted upon rec-
Ofrr.ir.'on from the o'mmittee on credentials and a? the convention is.domi
r.ated by Southern J'arifir influences, the unholy alliance had its way. In it*
insolence it Increased the demand wiilch it made yesterday and insisted that ;t
receive net half a vote, but a full vote and romplete representation In th<?
Tv.rnty-nin:h and THrty.-third Apseir.hly districts. This was accordingly glvan
to the clique.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SAXTA CRUZ, Sept. 5.â
The proceeding's of the Republican State Convention
have almost become a story of the political history of the
State. The convention has met and in its segregated subconven
tions has transacted nearly all of the business it was expected to
do. The general convention has effected temporary organiza
tion, choosing the officers who were announced in The Call this
morning. Enthusiasm has run riot in this city, and not too
much can be said in praise of the people of Santa Cruz for their
hospitality, their generous entertainment and t>eir untiring ef
forts to make pleasant the visit of the convention delegates.
. Even- Congressional convention has finished its labors and
in only one instance was the programme changed. That change
was in the Second Congressional District, where S. D. Woods,
and not E. A. Forbes, was nominated for Congress. In the
First Congressional District J. X. Gillette was named as Presi
dential Elector, but. as announced by The Call, he declined, and
T. \Y. Ryan of Humboldt was chosen in his stead. In the Sev
h Tongressional District Dr: Chester Rowell declined a simi
lar honor, and Captain James McFadden received it.

The "Stars and Stripes" was the them?
cf thÂ«^ singers and well they responded
to It. The immense audience of men and
Â¦women crowding- the pavilion t6 the very
doors arose to its feet and with a cheer
welcomed the song which had not yet
l)*>en sung, and cheer after cheer was
Kiven with a will. Handkercniefs and
hats wero waved. Enthusiasm seemed to
be contagious.
Great Outbursts of Patriotism.
As the stirring music of the patriotic
feOi ~ Bounded in the ears of tho gn-ai
throes ar. immense American flag wa*
twuiig down from the rafters. The voices
of the singers were lost In the uproar of
cheers which followed. It was a signifi

When the song was ended the audience
would not be satisfied. Again and again
;<. demand was made for. more and tue
Glee Club responded to the encore.
When the convention opened the scent
was a striking one. The convention hal!,
:he largest in the city, was splendidly
adorned within and without. The citizen*
of Santa Cruz had left nothing undone to
welcome their guests worthily. Within
and without the scene was one of bril
liant color. From the towers of the build-
Ing: ionp streamers, flags and bannets
floated !n the breeze. Inside the hail th'.
galleries were hidden in the folds of tho
Stars and Stripes. The rafters were a
mass of colorâ swaying bands of the na
donal colon and patriotic emblems
adorned the walls and stage. Pictures of
McKinley and Roosevelt were behind the
speakers' mand and In the air was tho
fragrance of Sowers scattered In pro
fusion. The delegates to the. convention
certainly could have asked no more from
their generous hosts in the little city by
the sea.
The patriotic songs of the Glee Club ln
ppired the convention to an enthusiasm
which continued throughout the procetti Â¦

CALL HEADQUARTERS.
BANTA CRUZ. Sept. b.-The
convention was called to or
der by Coionel George Stone
at 2:23 o'clock this afternoon,
practically without formality
â without the ostentation
w hlch usually accompanied
Mr. rtuef was practically nlone in his
fight against the strons forces of the
bosses. Throughout his argument he was
interrupted by hard-looking citizens, who
were in the lobby, and for their own pro
tection tho committee bad to demand of
the intruders that they remain quiet.
Despite the interruptions and threatening
looks Ruef argued for the decent element
in politics. Knowing that he stood lit
tle chance of receiving a fair deal'before
the committee, he tried conciliatory
measures, but the Kelly, Crimmins and
Herrln "push." feeling secure In the pos
session of a sufficient number of the
members of the committee, would havo
no compromise. ThÂ«y wanted a decision
and they secured one.
After listening to the arguments of
Messrs. Ruef. Welch, and George W. Pen
nlncton (who fpoke Rlrongly In favor of
the certificates signed by Chairman Bou
vier and Secretary Wilson), and the re
marks of James Alva Watt. Leon Â£am
uiÂ»1r. Pat HetHlCfasey and others, the com
mittee went into executive session and be
hind closed doors carried out the plot of
Bosses Kelly. Crimmins and Herrin, which
they had been appointed to do.
The .unseated delegation will make no
further fight in this convention, but will
carry It to tho municipal convention,
which is to be held in San Francisco.
Ruef showed that, according to the pall
of the State Central Committee, the cer
tificate of Chairman Bouvier and Secre
tary Wilson was all that was requirei
and that the delegates from every county
In the State were similarly certified; that
the paper presented by the Kelly-Crim
mins-Herrin delegation had been
made out after they had discov
ered they had lost their vote nt
the primaries and was a direct ef
fort to subvert thÂ»- will of the people as
clearly expressed at the primary election.
Watt replied but he did not care to go
into the merits of the case, relying upon
the personnel and organization of thÂ«
committee to carry through the scheme
which he hnd proposed in the interest of
Kelly and Crimmins.
The delegates certified to by Chairman
Alfred Bouvier and Secretary Wilson of
the County Committee were represented
before the committee on credentials by
A. Ruef, who made a forcible and con
vlncinc Â¦ exposition of the case. : James
AlvÂ» "Watt was present in the interests
of the County Committee.
The committee on credentials that was
named proved no surprise. As soon as It
was announced from the platform it was
openly declared to be packed in the inter
ests of the Kelly-Crimmins-Herrin dele
gation. The partisans of Kelly wore
broad smiles and openly boasted that the
committee on credentials would seat their
delegates, no matter what the evidence
might show.
The contest in San Francisco began in
the convention in the afternoon. A mo
tion to appoint a committee, of threu
from each Congressional district was
made by Mr. Sims, who was slated for
chairman of the committee on creden
tials. By prearrangement. Max Gold
berg 1 , who represented the County Com
mittee faction, asked that the San Fran
cisco delepation be not recognized in the
making up of other committees. Chair
man Van Fleet suggested to the maker
of the motion that he accept an amend
ment, which he did. This was denounced
as unfair by Mr. Ruef. who said the con
tested delegations contained only twelve
delegates, while the San Francisco dele
gations comprised 130 members.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. ' SANTA
CHUZ. Sept. 5.â The committee on creden
tials lost no time in getting to work im
mediately after the adjournment of the
convention. W. M. Sims of Sacramento,
chairm.in of th^ committee, and his fellow
members hurried to the chambers of thn
Supervisors in the City Hall and for two
hours listened to the arguments of the
contesting delegations from San Francis
co. They then went into executive se?s:on
and decided to unseat the delegates who
were certified to by the Uouvier-Ruef fac
tion of San Francisco.

SOUNDING KEYNOTE
OF THE CAMPAIGN
SANTA CRUZ "SURF"
TURNS REPUBLICAN
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Editor A. A. Taylor, a Lafelomg Dem
ocrat, RemoMinices Bryamasm and
Supports MeKImley.
SANTA CRUZ. Sept. 5.â The
Daily Surf, always recognized
as a leading dally of the
State, and whose editor, A. A.
Taylor, ranks among the best
as a writer, came out to-day
editorially in favor of Mc-
Kinley and Roosevelt. The
Surf , .established as a Demo
cratic paper, has always supported that
party. The editorial occupies five columns
of space. In his introductory remarks
Mr. Taylor says to his readers:
For two decades I have addressed you upon
seme topic or other nearly every day in these
columns. Durinsc this period, with only two
brief intervals, everything appearing on this
page has bÂ»eti the product of my*, pen or has
received the stamp of personal approval.
ISorn a Democrat, with three generations of
Democratic blood In my veins; reared a Demo
crat; engaged for the greater part of my active
life formulating and advocating Democratic
policies and promoting the interests of Demo
cratic candidates, any other course has hereto
fore appeared to me unthinkable.
It was the effort and desire of the Surf, as
well as of many others, to have the Demo
cratic Convention in California promulgate a
platform which should embody advanced sen
timent on new issues and put the Democratic
perty In the van of progress.
It was not done, and both parties drifted
through the campaign of '93 rudderless, so far
as the new conditions were concerned.
Time passed and by the terms of a treaty
the Philippines and Porto Rico were Incorpor
ated into the American domain. That treaty
found some of Its most ardent supporters
among Democrats, Us principal opponents
among Republicans. It is a matter of history
that its ratification was finally accomplished
In the Senate by the personal efforts of 'Wil
liam J. Bryan. Seventeen Democratic Senators
voted to confirm ths treaty, which it is now
proposed to repudiate.
I believe before November millions of our
countrymen heretofore affiliating with the
Democratic party will see the danger of adopt
ing the course Mr. Bryan has now marked out
and will give their ballots and their influence
to upholding the only policy consistent with
American hor.or, regardless of the name come
by the party In power or of how much they
may like or dislike Mr. McKlnley.
In Favor of Expansion.
Editor Taylor then outlined his views
on expansion and quoted from editorials
published In the Surf during the late war,
which supported the policy of the Govern
ment. The editorial continued:
In the meantime, by force of gravitation of
events more than of volition, the admin" st ra
tion became committed to It3 present policy
which has now been affirmed In the Republican
platform and from which no party la Congress
or out cannot widely depart.
Under the head of "The Die Cast" hÂ«
says:
The Democrats In Kansas City adopted a plat
form at variance with this policy, but as po
litical platforms are proverbially Interpreted to
suit emergencies there might still have been
room for "expansionists" within the Demo-i
cratlc ranks but for ths attitude taken by MrJ
Bryan, which admits of no evasion or equivo
cation.
It i3 on the question of expansion Mr.
Taylor disagrees with his party. Ha
speaks of the material blessing brought
by the acquisition of the Philippines and
says :
In short. It transferred California from ths
rira to the center of American activities. So
vital and so vivid were these charges that a
few Californians have not yet been able to per
ceive'the transition.
Imperialism In all Its subtle forms ought to
be exposed and resisted, bat It Is a rnoclc
article which is being politically exhibited at
the present time.
No sane citizen can believe that William Me-
Kinley or Roosevelt are less deeply attached
to the principles of liberty than. Mr. Bryan
and Mr. Stevenson. On the contrary, there
com?9 the ever- recurring conviction that noth
ing 1 could be more subversive of true Amerlcan
lr.m than the course Mr. .Bryan announces that
he will pursue. I
Bryanism vs. Americanism.
The editorial concludes as follows:
We? are no longer playing the game of
politics in our own back yard. We ara
acting the star part on the world's stago
cast for It by Providence, destiny, fortune
or whatever name we may spply to tho
mysterious fate which Iead3 men and na
tions in ways they knew not of.
By a chain of circumstances extending
back a little more than two years wa
have been gradually drawn to the focus
of mundane affairs, where America stands
to-day as the most conspicuous, the most
powerful moral and material force In the
whole world, destined to be the arbiter
of nations, the superior power on this
planet.
Now In this crisis Bryanism says "draw
back": Americanism says "go forward.
Let whoever will or may be President; let
parties rise or fall."
of Mexico and floated In victory from the
dome of their Capitol?
Was Andrew Jackson an "Imperialist"
at New Orleans, or later when he enforce!
American rights in Florida, or when he
said, "The Union â it must and shall bÂ»
preserved." and crushed incipient nu'liflca
toin in South Carolina?
Some Pertinent Questions.
Let the Democratic false alarmists
stand by the grave of Jackson and prato
of "imperialism" if they dare. Why. if
that rugged patriot would rise from his
sleep he would blast those lillputiana with
one glanceâ hi3 indignation would silence
them forever.
Was Abraham Lincoln an "imperialist"
when he struck secession down and lifted
man upâ when he saved the Union for
you. for me. for all who are heavy-bur
dened and thirst for liberty under law?
Was General Grant an "imperialist"
when, laying aside his unconquerable
sword, he said, "Let us have peace"?
Was William McKlntey an "Imperialist"
when, after diplomacy had failed, he ap
proved the declaration of war against
Spainâ a war as righteous as it was glr>
rtous? Is he an "imperialist" now. when
in the discharge of his high constitutional
duties and in obedience to an oath regis
tered jn heaven he is enforcing the su
preme laws of the land?
What is this thing they call "imperial
ism"? Is growth "imperialism"? If so,
what enthusiastic and aggressive "impe
rialists" we have been from Jamestown
and Plymouth to this very hour.
Is expanding territory "imperialism"? If
so. how have we offended?
Was the Louisiana purchase due to Jef
ferson's "Imperialism"? If so, then let ua
restore it to France.
Was Florida acquired by reason of Mon
roe's devotion to "imperialism"? If so,
give it back to Spain.
Was Texas the offspring of this monster
"imperialism"? If so. cede It to Mexico or
set It adrift as an Independent nation.
Was Alaska purchased in order to deck
the "crown" of "imperialism"? If so. re-Â»
convey It to Russia.
Is California, crowned with her
fifty years and celebrating her golden
jubilee, a misshapen child of "im
perialism"? "Were the pioneers a gang
of marauders? Are the native sons,
of sterling manhood, the native
daughters, of queenly beauty, the de
scendants of "imperialistic" free
booters P If so, stop the celebration,
pull down the stars and stripes from
the dome of our Capitol and tell Gov
ernor Gage to give way to an heir of
Montezoma.
Democratic Party One of Dissension.
The Democratic party is not only a
party of dissent and opposition; it ia tha
incarnation of dissatisfaction. It maps
out no large national policy, it constructs
nothing of permanent valuer it know*
nothing of practical statesmanship and
seems to care less about sustaining what
has been achieved by the valor and ability
of American patriots. Its most aistin
guishing characteristic, however, is it=Â»
dissatisfaction with anything and every
thing accomplished by the Republican
party, however much those things may
contribute to the stability of the Oovern
ment and the prosperity of the people.
You remember haw Democratic urator3
in furtherance of that party's free trade
policy clamored for foreign markets. We
have given the products of our factories
and farms enlarged foreign markets so
that our shipments abroad are now
greater than ever before in the history of
the republic and are Increasing with al
most miraculous strides; but still. tney aio

You remember how they declaimed
about the balance of trade being against .
us as a nation. It was against us. hut

it is vastly in our favor, constantly ia
creasing and In the year 10fX) will mount
to the stupendous sum of $-jOu,000,0'A>. But
still they are not rattened.
You remember how they lamented and
sher! crocodile tears over the scarcity of
a circulating currencyâ the alleged small
amount of money per capita In the Cnltert
States â claiming that . the*sÂ»nrnou;it of
money per capita was an unfailing index
to national prosperity. We have increased
that per capita from $22 07. when McKlr
ley was inaugurated on March 4. 1S37. iÂ«Â»
$23 71 on June 1, 1200; it is now larger than
ever before in the republic, and notwith
standing the constant increase In popu
lation the per capita is steadily growing
larger, for reasons which are obvious t.Â»
thoughtful menâ the influx of gold from
abroad and the marvelous output of our
mines: but still they are not satisfied.
America's Splendid Foreign Policy.
Vou remember how they demanded a
vigorous foreign policy. We have en
forced a foreign policy, aggressive, pru
dent and firm, which has made the Amer
ican name respected in every land and
the American flag honored on every wave;
but still they are not satisfied.

posed to all trusts which destroy legiti
mate competition and oppress Individual
enterprise. It denounces such trusts as
hurtful and declares them to be criminal.
It would abolish them and prevent them
from re-forming, one and allâ even the gi
gantic and barbarous ice trust, from
whose robbery of the thirsty poor the
Democratic scholar, reformer, leader, pur
ist and all-around $20,000 Bryan backer,
"Dick" Croker, grows fat and Insolent.
The Democratic rhetorician, who charm
ed a convention by a borrowed phrase.is
strangely silent in the presence of this
cake of ice. It seems to have cooled his
ardor.
Without pausing to consider the cause
of trusts or to suggest a practical way to
abate them, he shouts that the "tariff
has been a bulwark of the trusts." Will
he have the goodness to tell us what the
tariff duty is on ice? And if he can de
scend from his lofty flight and rest his
Imagination long enough to answer an
other question, will he inform us what
the duty is on the products of the Stan
dard Oil trust?
But now they tell us that "militarism -
"imperialism" is the issue, the pararnount
issue. How they love that word! A
change has come over the spirit of their
dream. They now deem It politic to con
ceal their purpose of disarranging and
debasing our currency, of packing the
Supreme Court of the United States, of
sustaining tho solid Democratic South in
its attempted nullification of the four
teenth and fifteenth amendments, and
they turn to do battle with a creature of
their heated and distempered imagina
tion. "Militarlsm"-"lmperialism!" There
is no such issue. Injected into political
discussion It i? a fictitious issue, a false
issue. To borrow their beloved word. It is
a paramount. humbug!
Smells of the Grave.
The American people have heard this
cry before. It has not even the merit of
originality. It smells of the grave wherein
lie buried and almost forgotten the Issues
of the past. They were nauseated by it
when Jackson was President. They lis
tened to and scorned it when Lincoln in.
1864 was making the supremo effort to
crush rebellion. Farther back even the
father of his country was charged with
"imperialistic" tendencies and aiming at
monarchy. .-
If the Democratic deelalmers in Cali
fornia and elsewhere have acquired the
habit of reading history and chance to
have the speeches of Thomas II. Benton
in their single tax and free trade libraries
I commend them to a perusal of his mas
terlv defense of Andrew Jackson, deliv
ered in the United States Senate in 1537.
To be sure, modern Democracy has turned
its back on the teachings of Jackson, but
it may be timely to recall that in his day
and generation he stood for national
unity, national supremacy and the pro
tection of American citizens wheresoever
they might be on a lawful errand.
But Jackson wjls denounced as a
"tyrant despot, usurper, destroyer of the
liberties of his country." seeking to over
throw the republic and to erect tin em
pire on its ruins. For leaping to the de
fense of American citizens abroad he was
charged with treasonably undermining
the constitution. The air was full of in
temperate attacks ton his patriotism.
Speaking of his watchfulness and ag
gressive Americanism Benton says â and I
quote him for the benefit of all who are
just now hampering the administration
and discouraging American soldiers:
But one slnjde Instance of outrage has oc
curred, and that at the extremities of the
world, and by a piratical horde, amenable to
no law but the law of force. The Malays of
Sumatra committed a robbery and massacre
upon an Amercan vessel. Wretches! they did
not then know that Andrew Jackson was Presi
dent of the United States, and that no distance.
no time, no idle ceremonial of treating with
lobters and assassins, was to hold back the
arm of Justice. Commodore Downes went out.
His cannon and his bayonets struck the out
laws In their den. They raid In terror and in
blood for the outrage which was committed,
and the creat lesson was taught to these dis
tant pirattsâ to our antipodes themselvesâ that
not even the entire diameter of the Rlobe eouM
protect them, and that the name of American
citizen, like that of Roman citizen in the great
days of the republic and of the empire, wps
to be the Inviolable passport of all that' wore
it throughout the whole" extent of the habitable
riobe.
The People Uphold McXinley.
The people understood Jackson even as
tr-ev understand MoKfnley, and as they
upheld the htro of New Orleans, even so
will they uphold the Chr'stian hero who
is putting forth the strength of the re
public to rescue American citizens from
Asiatic butchery ana to strike terrcr into
tho hearts of all who would touch with
hortile hands the American fli>Â£.
Is the enforcement of lawful au
thority, the putting down of rebel
lious insurrection, "militarism"? Is
the employment of American bayo
nets to rescue American men, women
and children from indignity, death
and mutilation â is that "militar
ism"?
Is the establishing of peace, order, se
curity to life and property in territory
rightfully acquired hy the United States
is that "militarism"? Was General Law
ton a brigand? Is General Mac Arthur a
despot? Is General Chaffee an enemy of
liberty? Was Admiral Dewey a bucca
neer sailing under the "black flag, or an
American hero, who smote tyranny in his
stronghold and In an hour added addition
al and imperishable luster to the Stars and
Stripes?
Is it "imperialism" to uphold authority
and enforce law and order In Porto Rlro,
In Alaska, in Hawaii, in the Philppines?
Was James K. Polk an "Imperialist"
â¢when as President and commander in
chief our flag was carried Into the heart

"CAMPAIGN" KEYNOTE
CA L L . HEADQUARTERS.
SANTA CRUZ, Sept. 15.â
There was a flow of eloquent
and patriotic oratory to-day
In the Republican conven
tion, and the addresses of the
three speakersâ Samuel M.
Shortridge. and Judge Van
Fleet of San Francisco and the Hon.
Charles E. Poarce of St. Louis, won the
warm applause of the great audience.
Mr. Shortrldpe was elorjuent, logical and
convincing. He hold his audience abso
lutely by a brilliant discussion of national
issues. Time and again the hall rang with
tumultuous applause." Time and again the
sentiments of the speaker, were cheered
and when he had finished he received the
well-won tribute of three cheers for him
self.
At the conclusion of the address of Mr.
Shortridge, Congressman Charles E.
Pearce of St. Louis was introduced and
received with enthusiasm. He was called
upon to speak and responded, addressing
the convention convincingly on the issues
of the campaign. . ;.
Judge Van Fleet's address, on taking
tho gavel, was also eloquent and patriotic,
and he too received the plaudits of his
hearers. The speeches are given below.
ââ¢
The only national anti-trust law on the
statute books was drafted' by a Repub-
Mean statesman. Senator Sherman, passed
by a Republican Congress, signed by a
Republican President and has been en
forced and is being executed by a Re
publican administration. Acts, not words;
statutes, not immature vaporings, are the
tests of capacity and sincerity/ The Re
publican party has ever been and is op-
In the midst of all this nationai pros
nerity and glory, what 13 their grievance?
A few months ago these needy office seek
ers gave out that trusts were the issue,
the sreat issue, the paramount issue.
Paramount issue! Have you noticed their
partiality, their affection for that word?
If there is one word in the English lan
guage that the Democracy delights in It
is paramount: they simply dote on It.
The people will not soon forget that there
was once a Democratic paramount Com
missionerâ"Paramount" Blount, who
went to Honolulu and did what no Re
publican 1 ever did or will ever do â pulled
down the American flag. It will never be
pulled down again.
Republicans the Curbers of Trusts.
Following the example of their
voluble leader, the Democratic mana
gers have inaugurated a campaign of
deception and slanderâ deception of
the people and slander of Republican
men and Republican measures.
To say that the Republican party puts
the dollar above the man is knowingly to
utter _a great and monstrous untruth, for
the first anil last purpose of all Repub
lican !eglslatton has been and is to dig
nify and exalt humnn labor. Garbling
the words, distorting the meaning and
misrepresenting the purpose of Abraham
I-incoln will not ncrsuade the American
people of the fitness or capacity of Mr.
Bryan; it will, rather, convince them of
his insincerity and utter unworth. The
Presidency has never been reached by
jueKHn? with facts, by misquoting the
language of the dead or by impugning the
pattiotlsm of the living.

CALX. HEAXM3UARTERS. SAN
JOSE. Sept. 5. â Xo clouds ap
peared on Democracy's horizon
until late this afternoon, when
the Los Angeles "push" dele
gation resolved to make a vigo
rous effort to smash the State
Central Committee's Elate for the chair
manship.
It is Quite well known that the Demo
cratic leaders, who assembled at the Cali
fornia Hotel In Saa Francisco to partake
of the inspiration which comes In a con
ctant stream from the temple of Gavin
McN'ab in the Mills building, decided
eome time ago that R. M. Fitzgerald
should be chairman of the convention.
There were several reasons for the selec
tion, the chief one bring that the Demo
cratic party all along its declining way
from Jefferson to Bryan has honored the
good Fitzgcralds. When this arrange
ment was made the Los Angeles delegates
Â¦were not consulted. It was made before
the southern delegates were chosen and
before the Southern Pacific had issued
passes to them.
In San Francisco this moraine Gavin
5i c \ab was stood up by the leader of the
southern contingent and asked to sur
render the appointments of committees to
the south, lie declined to deliver the
goods demanded and the talk of pro
gramme resistance then began.
Allender in the Fight for Chairman.
F W. Allender. chairman of the Los
Angeles delegation, frankly announced to
nisrht that he Is a candidate for tempo
rary chairman of the convention. He
claims the solid surport of fifty-five men
in his own delegation and reports that
he- has ass--urar.ee of the united assistance
of all the delegations south of Tehachapl
Later in the evening he was cheered by
the intelligence that delegations repre
senting Fresno. Kern. Kings and Stanis
laus wfTÂ» rÂ«ady to Join the south in an
ri'-^t to broak the slate.
< uhor southern delegates are not so pos- ;
Itive of their ability to upset the McNab j
programme . Th*'y threaten, however, to j
make determined r<?is=tnnee If' they are
not accorded full recognition in the make
up nf the rommlltpp?. The <-nlm and
Â«-hr<nvd politicians predict that there will
not be a bitter fight because thÂ»*re is noth
bur to fight about.
When Gavin McN'ab. who arrived thl3 i
evening, was n=kr-d about thÂ«Â» trouble, he j
refused to credit the ptat^m^nt that thÂ» !
'VT'T'Osltion to R. M. I itzgerald was form- !
JB- >Ie. It Ir probable that Mr. McNab ;
f? Â¦Â¦â¢ ik5 with something like definite know!- ;
edc<Â». i
Again it Is highly probable that the Los
Angeles delegates are not apprised of Me- I
SC&b'a enterprise in the line of corralling I
proxies and keeping a big bunch In silent j
r<-fi>rvÂ« for use In the event of urgent I
necessity. He always keeps a few open
proxies which may be used as "first aid
to the Injured." but there are others.
Even the chairman of the State Central
Committee, when asked to make an esti
mate of the number of proxies controlled
by McXab. declined to guess.
A Democratic State Convention 13 not a
new object lesson in San Jose, hence the
citizens do not turn out with banners and
hands to welcome the Incoming delegate.-.
A corral greeting, however is extended
to the Democratic visitors. The conven
tion which nominated General Stoneman
for Governor assembled in this city. Sub
sequently the State convention which
ff-lected E. B. Pond ap a candidate for
Governor met in San Jose. Stephen M.
White attended both conventions.
The delegates to the present convention
will nssemble In tho Victory Theater at
11 a. m. to-morrow. The Mayor of San
Jose, on account of ill health, will nut
attempt to make an address of welcome-.
The pirasant duty of extending the com
pliments and hospitalities of the occaslo:;
will be performed by V. A. Schiller at
pome opportune time to-morrow. Wel
come will be Riven by a quartet of male
voices.
There Will Be Flow of Oratory.
The speech of Senator J. C. Sims. chaJr
man of the State Central Committee. In
calling the convention to order will not
be long. It is assumed that D.-M. Delmas
will sppak at length and give the audienc-.
a pample of his hlghfiown style of oratory.
Stephen M. White is counted on- for an
elonuent contribution. rrÂ»
The Ftory wired from Los Angeles to
the effect that Mr. White was ardentlv
supporting W. A. Spauldlng for the nom
ination for Congress in the Sixth District
Is vigorously dented by delegates from the
s=outh. There '- strong opposition to
Spauldlng In the I/O* Angeles delegation.
It is charged that he is an out and out
Sociallfl^with leanings toward anarchy.
A survey of the field to-ni^ht convinces
cne that the Democrats have not closely
programmed in the matter of nominations
for Congress. There are open contests In
the Third. Sixth and Seventh districts,
with 'ndications of a big battle in the
Fourth.
It was settled to-night to make Stephen
M. White chairman of thp committee on
resolutions. Of course the committee will
not roport a resolution indorsing Mm as
the Democratic candidate to succeed
George C. Perkins In the United States
Senate. The ronvntion, however, speak
ing for the general body, may adopt a res
olution commending him for the excellent
fcervices rendered to the country in gen
eral nnd to California In particular while
he served in the Srnate.
Phelan Does Not Figure.
The Idea of Mayer Phelan of San Fran- j
Cisco rcr.'ntlng on Indorsement of White Is I
regarded here as preposterous. Phelan I
cuts no figure whatever In the calculation
of politicians assembled here. A leading
Democrat asked to-night: "Do you hoar
Fhelan spoken of in any connection? Is
th^re p delegate h"re that cares a copper
what he Pays or thinks?"
If ex-Senator White desired a straight
out indorsement as the Democratic can
didate for ihe United States Henate he
could have- it. But his closest friends as
sert that he is not an aspirant, that he
has hao all the Senatorial prestige he de-
The honor of placing R. M. Fitzgerald
in nomination for temporary chairman of
the convention v.ill be given to A. B.
Ware of Sonoma County. F. W. Allender
will probably be named as chairman of
the committee on order of business The
recognition is given to the south in order
to preserve the harmonies of the occa
sion. The southerners, after reflection
have concluded that it would be follv to
follow up the fight against the McNab
programme.
Â£?ifc T as T J urth Â«' r settled to-n'sht that
Nicholas P.owden of Santa Clara should
bo chairman of the committee on creden
tials. Two contests aro pending one In
'Vk! Thirty-first and tho other' in the
JThirty-seventh District of San Francisco
The leading: contestants of the Thlrtv
seventh District are Wesley Reed and
Francis J. Hennoy. It Is known that they
will put up a strenuous battle for recog
nition before Nicholas Bowden's commit
tee of credentials. The committee will
consist of fifteen members. '
It was also decided to-night that tho
platform committee, of wmch S. M. White
Is to be chairman, shall consist of thtrtv
flvo members. The big guns of the party
will be^ assigned, to duty under the leader

SENATORIAL FIGHTS
LOST SIGHT OF IN
OTHER CONTESTS
CALL. HEADQUARTERS. SAN JOSE
Sept. 5.â In the general talk of platforms
and Congressional nominations the State
Senatorial scrambles seem to have bren
for the time lost sight of. Senator Chap
man is here from El Dorado and Placer
counties, but he is not making any active
advances to the delegates, although it Is
current In the lobby crowds that Ben. P.
Tabor of Auburn Is after his Job. Tho
other Senatorial booms eeem still in the
bud.
Allender of Los Angeles Announces That Me Wa3fl Make a Fight for the
Chairmanship, but Is Placated and Draws Off.
The translation of the letter found In
the bottle, if it Is decipherable, ought to
contain some definite account from the ex
plorers of their experience, possibly up to
and after passing the polar point.
Those who witnessed the departure of
the balloon from Danes Island estimated
Its speed, traveling straight to the north,
to be from thirty to thirty-five kilometers
an hour, at which rate it would have
reached the pole In less than two days.
It Is, however, generally considered thut
It was deflected from its course.
After these means of conveying mes
sages had been exhausted Andree would
naturally have recourse to the familiar
method of incloaure In bottles. A mes
sage numbered 143, If the proper sequence
had been kept, would mean that the voy
agers had traveled a considerable dis
tance on their journey.
The explorer also took with him thirty
two carrier pigeons. Some were expected
to return to Danes Island, where they
had stayed for more than a month, but
it was feared they would never return
to Sweden, as from Spltzbergen alone they
would have to travel a distance of ne'ariy
2500 kilometers in order to find he!r uove
cote. From the pole to Sweden would be
2500 meters. Such a distance, so far as is
known, has never been traversed by car
rier pigeons;
Andree, when he started on his balloon
voyage on July 11, 1597, took with him
twelve dispatch buoys, each consisting of
a sphere of cork twenty centimeters In
diameter, coated with * a thick coat o?
paint, partly blue and partly yellow, and
protected by a network of copper wire.
At the upper portion was a copper stop
per inscribed with the words, "Andree'3
Polar Expedition. ISOtJ," and a numbet.
This stopper closed a cavity cut in the
cork to receive a tube, in which it was
intended to Inclose documents or mes
sages from the explorers. The buoys were
to be thrown out at different points of
the voyage of the balloon. A thirteenth
buoy, larger than the others, was to be
left at the point of the route that should
be nearest to the geographical pole that
could be reached by the balloon.
"VARDOE, Wednesday.â A bottle from
Andree, containing a note numbered 143,
has been found four miles east of Var
doe."
NEW YORK. Sept. 5.â The harbor
master of Vardoc, the most northerly of

DEI>EGATES ARRIVE AND
HTJBRY ON TO SAN JOSE
The Sixth Is in the throes of one of the
hardest fights of the State. There are
five candidates, all out and working, but
so far Graves and Rush claim to hold the
situation between them. Th<* canrli.intes
are C. A. Stork. Mayor of Santa Barbara;
William Graves of San Luis Obispo. Jud
son Rush of Los Angeles, R. J. Adcock
of Los Angeles and W. A. Spalding of
Los Angeles. It was whispered around
the hotel this evening that Stephen
White had wired that Spalding was his
man and that he was coming to San Jose
to make the Spalding fight, but the candi
dates all denied the report and declared
that White was Roing to keep his hands
off. It has been urged against Spalding
th.it he has attended no less than three
socialistic lectures, and the southern dele
gates seem Inclined to shy at soch'lsm.
They have tried gold and riiver and Popu
lism snd a half dozen other things, but
they seem to scare -il socialism.
In v the Seventh District the fisht seems
to He between W. D. CricMon of F~esno
and William Holcomb of San Dlotjo. P.
J. Maddox of Stanislaus and C II - Castle
of Merced are also In the fight, but they
seem not to be active. The Holcomb men
arc armed wiih figures from the last elec
tion by which they are willing to prove
that the selection of the south lies In Hol
comb, but the figures are not worrying
the others, and they aie working- right
a'.onsr.
At" a late hour to-night J. H. Henry, of
this city, yielding to the earnest solicita
tion of his friends, consented to enter the
race for Congress in the Fifth District.
His nomination is predicted.

old place in Washington. The city dele

less the whole delegation comes together

however, that he is not a candidate, and
his withdrawal for good may simplify
matters.
CALL HEADQL'AHTERS.
SAN JOSH, Sept. 5.â Th? se
lection of the Democratic
candidates for the electoral
collepe from this State is* ho
far somewhat of a problem.
In the First District there is
no candidate to-night promi
nent enough to mention. In the others
thsre are one or more mentioned, but the
interest in them is subordinate to that in
the Congressional contests and it is prob
able that any one who is really willing
to make a , good run for the place can
have it in any of the districts.
In .the Second Will R. Jacobs of Stock
ton is a likely man. and reported to be
running against him is Caminett!. who
has said he wants no office this year. It
docs not look like an interesting race.
The hottest fight, if fight there be In
py,y of the districts, seems to be in the
t-iuh, where tbeÂ»/r|ends of John B. Ry
lard cf San Jose arc trying to get him
into the fifcht against J. H. Henry of San
ta Clara, and !he li^ht j s really between
the friends of Ryland and the friends of
Henry. A third man in the running is
James N. Block. ex-Tax Collector of San
Frfinoisco. h'-t Ms race is of the pathetic
c.rcer â a den't-care not-sorry-to-be-beaten
kind cf a contest that may or may not
win out.
As for elector at large there are but two
mentioned â J. H. Spawell of Uklah. from
the north, and W'lllard Stimson of L01
Angeles, from the south, to fill the two
places.
In the Sixth there is Nathan Cole of
Los Angeles, with T. A. Rice of Ventura
to dispute hi? title, and in the Seventh
there are F. G. Havens r.t Riverside and
J. J. Hanford of San Bernardino, who 13

In the Fourth the only ones mentioned
are William T. Baggett. the lawyer, and

In the Third District Dr. TV*. L. Prather

SOUTH REVOLTS AGAINST THE PROGRAMME
OF GAVIN McNAB AND THREATENS REPRISALS
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SAN JOSE. Sept. o.â The Democratic State Convention, to nssemble in thin city tc-mor
row, may no: be dominated by the Southern Pacific Company, but the hand of the meddling corporation is already
visible. Delegates from San Diego and Lo.= Angelas, who were elected to represent the people, traveled hither on
passes issued by the railroad company. The excuse given for the acceptance of free transportation is that the dis
tance Is great and the fare high. â¢ '
The convention in the main will be composed of men of character an.l independence. No enthusiasm is manl
feÂ«=tÂ»d to-night, but a demonstration is expected on the arrival to-morrow forenoon of the San Francisco delega
tion. The chW obstacle confronting the delegates who are on th<> ground t.T-night Is to fii.d acceptable candidates who will
\ake the chance of battle against the almost assured winners on the Republican side.
The platform will have some Interesting if not new features^ and all the old principles, dear to the hearts of Democrats.
Â»s weli. A point will be made on the forestry law und the conservation of water, and both will be indorsed fully.
The constitutional amendment making it possible to enforce a voting test, and therefore passing over the objections
raised by the Supreme Court to a primary law, will be Indorsed. Not so with the amendment providing for an appellate
court, however. The convention will indorse it. and it will probably be passed over in silence. There Is a reason for this
found in the fact that the amendment as passed by the lr.st Legislature does not provide for the election of the Judges of
This r.ew court. Instead, it was the Intention to have them appointed, and the appointment under present conditions would
be rr.ade by the Burns-Herrin coicbir.ation. This, according to a prominent Democrat, the convention will not stand for and
eo the amendment will be passed over.
There will be a plank on imperialism of the good old Bryan kind, roasting all that savors of expansion and denouncing
fill who favor It.
The platform will also respond to the demand of the University of California for additional revenue to be provided by
the Stare to mept the Increasing requirements for higher education.
There will be a plank favorinc the restriction of Japanese and other \siatic l*bor
There will also be a plank pledging all locators elected after nominated bv this convention to support a fair and log
f^J e t rp ortIonlnent of tbe State. It Is desired that the State v.hen rcappr.rtione.l by the next Legislature shall be districted

of the county and is a. man of means.

Caminetti of Amador. but lirst Nichols
withdrew and then Camtnetti withdrew,
and it looks as if Ford would follow suit
before morning and leave Sproul a clear
field. Nichols' withdrawal was announced
by the San Joaquin delegation this even
ing, and Caminetti himself told one of
the district delegates that he was not out
for anything this year.
The race in the Third Is in the air. Bur
dette Connell of Oakland and Judge Swin
ford of Colusa are so far the only two
candidates, and it is probable the delega
tion will caucus before the convention to
morrow and agree on one or the other.
There is little interest shown In the con
test, however.
In the Fourth District the fight is hot.
There is R. Porter Ashe. R. P. Troy and
Dr. C. C. O'Donnell. Ashe has opened
headquarters in the St. Jimes Hotel and
he and his friends are working hard, al
though Aehe Eays he does not care any
way. It is so with Troy, but O'Donnell
frankly says he wants the nomination,
nnrt for fear of being misunderstood i n (j le
matter he has had pampniets printe] bear,
ing his picture and his ambition, and
those he is distributing around the lobby
of the St. Jarm-s.
Emmet Seawell of Sonoma can have it
if he wants the nomination, but Seawell
Is not so sure he wants it. Frank Taft
of Crescent City, Del JN'orte County, is
also mentioned as a possible if not the
probable candidate, but he, too, is luke
warm. At one time this evening James
H. "Wilkins of San Rafael, the Prison
Commissioner, was spoken of, but Wil
kins says "no." He will have none of it.
No one wishes to run against the Repub
lican candidate in the face of the result3
of the last election, and so the fight In
the First is not an interesting' one.- Judge
Wilson of FTumboldt is also in the race.
There is not much Democratic hope in
the First Congressional District. It has
been solidly Republican all along, and at
the last election the Republican majority
was 1500, so thet^ is no Democrat who
cares to carry a banner, even a' Demo
cratic one, down to defeat.

Happily the people are not without
knowledge and the means of comparison
between the chief standard bearers of the
two great partiesâ that is, of the Repub
lican party on the one hand and the com
bined opposition, which is not susceptible
of designation by a single name, upon the
other. Four years ago they were oppos
ing candidates for the same great office
which they now seek. Mr. McKinley
stood upon a platform guaranteeing pro
tection to American Industries, honesty in
our national dollar, good faith in Ameri
can promises, work for Idle worklngmen,
prosperity to the working people.
McKinley's Actions and Bryan's
Principles.
Mr. Bryan then, as now. represented the
multifarious arid somewhat diverse dec
larations put forth by the factions by
which he was nominated, which in sub
stance and effect threatened the life of
our manufacturing interests, the stabil
ity of our finances, the integrity of our
national credit, the independence of our
judiciary and the peace and order of our
people. As a result of that contest Mc-
Kinley was elected and Bryan defeated.
For the past four years each has been,
in his particular sphere, kept before the
public eye. Mr. McKinley has been busy
Keeping the promises made In his plat
formâmaking good its guarantees and be
holdinp his country radiant In the sun
shine of prosperity, whose brilliance could
not be dimmed even by the murky clouds
of smoke pouring from every factory
chimney in the land; watching our trade
grow and grow, until from a debtor we
have become a creditor nation; noting the
restless mobs of idle men transformed
into busy groups of well paid working
men, and proclaiming to the world that
our dollar is an honest dollar and our ob
liRations payable only In such dollars
More than that, he has upheld our na
tlonarhonor, guided our country through
war to victory, met without faltering the
grave responsibilities placed upon us as
a result of that war, and prowing out of
our newly acquired territory in the West
Ind es and Philippines, and is but now
dealing with the new and momentous
qurstton, What shall be done with China?
witn a breadth of statesmanship that
commands the admiration of the civilized
During the time that McKinley has
been doing all this, creating, building
up, substituting work for want, plen
ty for poverty, happiness for despair,
Mr. Bryan has not been idle.
He has been going about the
country talking, talking, talking^ â
predicting that the result in 1S96 was all
a great mistake, that the prosperity
around us will prove a delusion; that the
proud edifice of a nation's greatness,
Jirisinj? everywhere through the efforts of
his adversary, will fall; that the great
work that has kept, all busy will cease;
the buzz of growing trade and the turn of
countless wheels will all stop, unless the
people shall elect him to tho Presidency
in 1D00. To-day the^e same candidates
seek for our suffrages.
Mr. McKinley now. as then. Is making
no promises that he cannot fulfill with
honor to himself and the continued pros
perity of the people.
Mr. Bryan is threatening us with dan
gers which have no existence other than
In his fertile imagination, and with
calamities which can never overtake us,
except it be through his election as Presi
dent.
Whom Shall We ChooseP
As between these two. which shall we
choose? The man of action or the man of
words? The doer of good or the prophet
of evil? The upholder of our flag in the
Philippines or the one who would haul it
down? The priest of prosperity or the
preacher of discontent? Can there be any
question as to our choice? No, we must
re-elect MoKlnley.
But there is, let me earnestly suggest,
one danger threatening this much to be
desired result, which to my mind Is the
only serious menace .to our success â the
tendency to overconfldence, and the
apathy which comes from a feeling of se
curity and satisfaction with conditions as
they exist. I do not wish to be regarded
as a calamity howler In calling attention
to this menace to the accomplishment of
our desires. That the danger exists else
where than In my own imagination I havo
but to refer you to the utterances of our
leading men and newspapers throughout
the country to. prove.
I have every confidence in the good pur
pose and honesty of the American peo
ple, when not misled, but we nre con
fronted by wily and indefatigable foes,
who never rest in their efforts to deceive
the people, and unless we make an effort
and show the people the right way, our
enemies may guide them wrong. Let us
leave our workshlps. our farms, our of
fices anil our mines for a day, or lonsr
enough to get together and organize;
there Is nothing like organisation to accom
plish results. Do not be afraid to organ
ize under leadership for fear of the cry
of "bosslsm." That word "boss" Is an
ugly one. and is only used to designate
an enemy. Wo all know that there Ib
really no such thing as boss-rule In this
country. The American people nre too
fearless and independent for its existence
There is leadership, necessarily, for that
Roes hand-in-hand with organization, and
the only successful way to make a fight
is by organization and Individual effort.
Admonishes the Party.
It is possible that Mr. McKinley would
be elected without effort on our part, but
it Is at least doubtful. The way to ac
complish a thlnK Is not to stay at home
in fancied security and wish for It. Some
times you can pet It that wny, but moat
frequently you do not. The best way is
to get out and rustle for It. It is thÂ« same
In politics as in everything else, and if we
put forth the right sort of effort and make
the right kind of a fitrht. I hav* no hesi
tation in predicting that we shall nlve our
national ticket this year the greatest ma
jority It has ever received In this Stateâ
a. majority that will ornfound our en

SOUNDING KEYNOTE
OF THE CAMPAIGN
To the one we propose to state
"Well done, good and faithful ser
vant; stay where you are for another
four years; the people are satisfied
This convention has met to Indorse the
administration of .William McKinley as
President of the United States during the
past four years and to nominate an-elec
toral ticket to represent his candidacy for
our further suffrage and that of his run
ning mate, Governor Roosevelt of New
York. The one we have learned to love
and honor for the magnificent manner in
which he has redeemed the trust that the
people confided In him four years ago;
the other for those great qualities of heart
and mind which have already disclosed
him to the people as the brave soldier and
fearless statesman, and as the man who
has done more in a short space of time
to expose dishonest jobbery and official
peculation and to disturb the Democratic
equilibrium than any man who has ever
pat In the Governor's chair of the great
State of New York.
Tribute to the Leaders.
It is no slight honor, apart from such
special consideration as 1 have just re
ceivt-d from your hands, to have a seat
in this. convention, representing as it does
a great State, a great party and the best
principles of government.
In opening this convention we should
not pass unnoticed a fact pregnant with
*o much interest to the people of this
State. We stand at the threshold of tho
fiftieth anniversary of our statehood. On
tiunday next, the 9th of September, Cali
fornia, will pass her naif-century mark.
Fifty years is considerable in the life of
a- man. but in that of a State it may be
much or little, according to Circumstances.
When we regard what California has ac
compllabed within the short span of her
existence as a State, her wonderful de
velopment in material resources, the vast
output of her precious metals, her grain
fields, her orchards and vineyards, her
reir.arkable development In the arts and
sciences, the existence and firm establish
ment within her borders of her two great
Institutions of learning, it is a matter of
astonishment that her existence should
have been so brief. But when we turn to
the future possibilities- of her as yet
largely undeveloped resourcesâ and who
shall venture to admeasure their extent?â
it would peem ehe had but just been born;
and it is In this sense that we are prone
to use ns a figure of comparison the ex
pression that she is yet in her infancy.
And this is true in a sense; but to us and
to the other . thousands, of - nor devoted
daughters and faithful eon? throughout
the State she Is a mother whose natal
day it is our proud privilege to observe
and honor.
In taking the gavel as the tempo
rary chairman of the convention,
Judge W. C. Van Fleet said:
I DESIRE to express to the convention
my sincere thanks for the honor they
.have just paid me. It is the more
gratifying by reason of its spontane
ous and unsolicited character, but I
trust my appreciation may be best evinced
by the manner in which I shall endeavor
to discharge the duties you have cast
upon me.
JUDGE VAN FLEET
IS BOTH THANKFUL
AND PATRIOTIC
We have the glory of San Juan and
Santiago and Manila and McKinley, and
they have what? (Voice, "Bryan.") The
possible shame of William J. Bryan.
We have the glory of an enfranchised
people. They have the shame of slavery.
Ah, gentlemen, what have we as Re
publicans to rejoice over? What have our
Democratic friends to rejoice over to-day?
"We have the glories of t ..e Civil War
and our united country. They have the
shame of secession.
Now, my friends, we have done what
people said we should do. We have ful
filled the promises made to the people
of our country by the convention of 1S9G
under the leadership and guidance of that
splendid President, the mas whom we will
seat there in November of this year for
another term of four years.
What Republicans Have Done.
In 1SIi4 it was my fortune to make a trip
around the world. There was not a com
mercial capital in Europe or Asia where
you could pass an American note at par.
There is not a city on the eloba to-day
where it is not at par. We promised to
secure the Hawaiian Islands and we havo
done it. We passed a resolution of sym
pathy for Cuba. We little dreamed now
we would come out of It. No man could
have forecast the future and read in 1SHO
that in less than two years we would
have fought a great war on land and
Fea and established the power and splen
dor and glory of tue American nation
throughout the world.
As a result nearly $400,000,000 of the na
tional debt has been refunded at 2 per
cent interest with a saving of about $7,000,
000. -
We passed the sound money law
and aS a result even the silver mine
owner is better off than if Bryan had
been elected.
Who does not remember how the in
dustrial life of this country came to lifa
anew and how the warm blood of indus
trial enthusiasm began to course through
its veins? Who will not remember that
the results of that law have been the
most splendid of ajiy law ever enacted
by an American Congress? And so we
tackled the financial problem and we did
just exactly what we said we would do.
We elected McKinley President and
he had hardly taken his seat when
Congress convened in special session
and passed a protective tariff law,
the best, the most beneficent piece of
legislation ever put on the statute
books, and put there by a Republican
Congressâ the Dingley tariff law.
for the upbuilding of the American navy
and of sympathy for Cuba.
It was not alone our purpose to nom
inate a gentleman as our candidate. We
proposed to nominate a man of work
The issue was then the industrial life of
the nation. It had been well nigh de
stroyed by the administration of Mr.
Cleveland and a Democratic ConRress.
We passed a resolution in that convention
affirminp the belief in the Republican
party and. In the wisdom of a protective
tariff. We passed a resolution afttrmin?
our belief in the wisdom of sound money
and the duty of the United States to ac
quire control of the Hawaiian Islands anl
The Nomination of McKinley.
It met there for work. It meant to do
what it has always done, that is to do
business, and at the conclusion of Its for
mal work, it nominated as Its condidate a
man in whom every American citizen be
he Democrat or Republican or Populist â
is proud of. He has carried to the White
House a pure and manly life. Those who
have known him In his family circle know
full well how beautiful and how attrac
tive is the life of William McKinley.
It was a question of safety and of life
itself to preach Republicanism in Mis
souri. From small beginnings L have seen
that party grow until, in ls%, we polled
3'jT.OOO Republican votes, and If you will
be patient with us a little while longer we
will "get there. Kli."
Four years ago the Republican party
met in National Convention Jn rny city
Who can forget the conditions under
which that convention met? Who can for
get the Industrial blight that was resting
upon and permeating the entire society of
the American continent? Who can forget
the heavy hearts that beat with slow pul
sations from the Atlantic to the Pacific?

the grand old city of St. I,ouis. which
polls the largest Republican majority of
any city in the .Union, except Philadel

after the civil war. It was desperate
work building up the Republican party in
those daysâ In the campaigns of 1S0S, 1872
and 1S76.

of splendid sport, were decided without

Lilly Andrew, a half-sister to Geyser,
stood a long hard drive under Farrell,
getting up in time to nip Maresa a neck
on the wire. The latter filly nearly made
a runaway race of it. Ab Stemler,
trainer of the winner, thought so lightly
of her chances that he saw the odds drift
from 5 to 2 to 7 to 1, and let her run un
backed.
Tom Boyle, a local owner, landed the

The books were heavily cannonaded on

SACRAMENTO, Sept. 5.â A quartet of
the ultra-fashionables of the light harness
world came down for the word in thj
2:10 class trot at Agricultural Park this
afternoon and the crowd which witnessed
this classic event was somewhat of a dis
appointment. Dolly Dillon. Phoebe Chlld
ers. Hazel Kinney and Claudius and what
they were capable of doing has furnished
quarter-stretch gossip for many days, and
a big throng. It was supposed, would wit
ness the struggle for supremacy. Still
those passing through the turnstiles cams
supplied with coin, which suited the pool
sellers and auctioneers just as well.
The race was disappointing, for Dolly
Dillon, the Santa Rosa stock farm entry,
ably driven by Millard Sanders, took the
second, third and fourth heats as easily
as a monkey would crack a peanut, not
being compelled to step faster than 2:12^.
After winning the first heat Phoebe Child
ders met all sorts of bad luck and tha
favorite. Hazel Kinney, over which P. "W
Hodges held the ribbons, never sseemed
able to get on an even keel, appearing un
certain and unwilling to exert herself.
Claudius showed surprisingly good form.
Business In the auction pooling- before
the first heat was brisk, with Hazel Kin
ney bringing $20, Phoebe Childers $6 and
the field $10. For the heat Phoebe Child
ers drew the inside position, but lost It
to Dolly Dillon at the first turn. \iliff
latter mare showed the way into the
stretch, when she left her feet and Phoebe
Childers came home with Laphara taking
her up. Hazel Kinney made two losing
breaks on the back stretch, finishing third
behind Claudius.
Even after this Hazel went for $20 with
a ready market, while the heat winner
brought $17 and Dolly Dillon and Claud
ius, as the Held, $5. The second heat
looked like another for Phoebe as she
struck the stretch, trailed by Claudius.
The teamsters behind the two leaders
went to the outside fence to get the
mall and Dolly Dillon dropped from the
clouds, the easiest sort of a winner In
2:13%. Strangely enough the favorite
again broke on the back stretch. Those
bettors "in bad" now "got wise" and,
selling favorite, Dolly made rag-time
work of the following two heats. Hazel
aroused herself a bit, finishing second m
each. â¢>

of four of Lord Roberts' chargers is taken
to be an indication that the commander
in chief of the British forces In South
Africa will soon return to England.
CAPE TOWN. Sept. 5.â The siege of
Ladybrand has been raised after several
desperate attempts to capture the town
and its little garrison of 130 British iroops.
The Boers who attacked Ladybrand are
estimated to have numbered over 2000
men. The British were summoned to sur
render September 2 (Sunday), but refused,
and from that time on were subjected to
continual cannon and rifle fire. The
burghers twice tried to rush the British
position. Probably the approach of a re
lief force saved the little garrison.

grandfather of Arthur Jr.. in l!>23 estab
lished the shipbuilding yards which have
been operated ever since by his sons,
grandsons and greatgrandson, and which
have made them all wealthy men. For
seventy-seven years their private signal,
a white "S" on a blue tleld, has fluttered
from the main spar of some of the swift
est and stanchest vessels In the mer
chant marine, carrying the stars and
stripes to every part of the world. The
firm now owns over forty fine ships built
In their own yards, and altogether have
built more than 100 vessels, including the
first steel sailing vessel ever launched in
American waters. She was called the
"DIrigo," which Is the motto of the State
of Maine.
Mr. Sewall, besides his shipbuilding and
commercial interests, was largely inter
ested in banking and railroads, having
been president of the Bath National Bank
since 1S71, and for a number of year3 prea
dent of the Maine Central Railroad and
director in several other New England
roads and some Southwestern roads. He
was also president of the Maine Water
Company, which had plants in seven cities
of that State.
Mr. Sewall was originally a Whig, but
since the death of that party had been
a Democrat. Though not a politician, he
was always an active member of his party
and a liberal contributor to Its campaign
funds. He was a member of the Demo
cratic National Committee from 1SS3 till
1896, and In the latter year, much to his
own surprise, was nominated at Chicago
by the Democratic National Convention
as candidate for Vice President on the
ticket with W. J. Bryan, and with him
went down to defeat In the following No

workers, has returned from Wellston,
Ohio. The board meeting to-morrow
will be the most important one held
since a general strike was ordered July
4, 1S9T, when 110,000 men were called out
of the mines for several weeks. The strike
now imminent Involves 143.000 men. Mr.
Mitchell expects the board to declare
without hesitation for a general anthra

est and most experienced members, has
been in the anthracite regions. Dilcher
is determined to force an issue with the
anthracite operators.
Inasmuch as the 8th falls on faaturday,
the strike, if ordered, will not become
effective until next Monday. The opera
tors have until Saturday to meet the flat
demands of the men.
The statement then goes on to dpny al

The statement asserts that the United
Mineworkers and their leaders are com

the conditions of anthracite mining, and
the association of the anthracite men

LONDON, Sept. 6. 4 p. m.â Sir Alfred
Gasetee's dispatch, which shows that the
situation in .Peking was unchanged on
August 29, is the only Chinese news this
morning. The cancellation of the order
holding back the Fourth Indian Brigade
is regarded as Important. It shows that
whatever the outcome of the Russian pol

to* have sufficient troops on the *pot ade

DETERMINED TO PROTECT
ALL BRITISH INTERESTS
LONDON, Sept. 5.â The British Admir
alty has issued Vice Admiral Seymour's
detailed report of the experiences of the
first Peking relief expedition. It is good
reading, but embraces nothing not pre
viously known. Referring to the harmo
nious action of the forces of the eight
nationalities engaged, he especially men
tions Captain von Usedom of the German
navy and Captain McCalla of the United
States army. Regarding the latter, he
says:
ADMIRAL SEYMOUR
PRAISES M'CALLA
LONDON, Sept. 5.â The Chinese Min
ister here admits the correctness in a
general sense of the cable message sent
to him, according to Snanghal advices, by
Li Hung Chang, in which the latter is
quoted as saying: "Our St. Petersburg
Minister has persuaded Russia to leave
Peking. You are useless If you cannot
persuade England."
The Chinese Minister here also says he
has sent a powerful memorial to Lord
Salisbury, urging him to adhere to the
Russian proposal to withdraw the allied
forces from Peking as he. Sir (Jhlh Chin
Lofeng Luh, believes It will pave the way
to a speedy settlement. The Minister also
said the Chinese people were sick of the
war. that the genuineness of Lt Hung
Chang's plenipotentiary powers was un
doubted and that LI Hung Chang was
working in full sympathy with the Em
peror. Dowager Empress and Privy Coun
cil, all of whom favored peace. '
The Minister added that he himself was
still in communication with the Chinese
Government, the authority of which re
mained entire and which was merely tem
porarily located In the province of Shensl.

SECURE WITHDRAWAL
direction, as it would regarded in China
as proof that the powers have remained
true to the spirit which Inspired the orig
inal programme. However great may be
the just Indignation which events in
China have provoked in all civilized coun
tries, the Russian Government, while ex
amining with necessary calmness all the
questions raised by the recent occur
rences, adhtres unalterably to the p-!n
clple forming the basis of her policy,
namely, the maintenance of p?ace with all
the powers who are solidly united for the
common good.''
"Captain McCalla was of the greatest
value to me and to all concerned. He was
slightly wounded In three places and well
merits recognition."
The report concludes as follows: "When
the fact that the Chinese beheaded any
one they got Is considered, the conduct of
such officers or men as exposed them
selves to capture is to be praised far
more than If the risk were taken against
a civilized foe."

villages en route, which were the seat of
the first Boxer outrages in the province
of Chili. The Russians Intend to repair
the railway through to Peking.
It is reliably asserted that native sol

Chang, are exterminating the Boxers ir.

Four prominent Boxers were executed
in Tientsin to-day. The French shot two

I hat Mr. Bryan is hardly the candidate
he should choose if he had his way in th'.;
matter and that ho entirely dis.-ents from

Olney says:
"Perfection in a candidate ox platform
is an idle dream and infirmity in Its creed
and defects in Its Icidership will always
characterize every party. But they in no
wise excuse a citizen from taking his
assigned part in the government of the
country â from making up, his mind what

casting his vote accordingly.
"Be it admitted that the Democratic
party, its platform and its candidates are
opon to much just criticism, yet, alj
things considered, would not its triumph
be the best outcome of the present Presi
dential contest?"
Mr. Olney then criticizes the policy of
the McKInley administration regarding
the Philippines and says he think3 that
the country will soon find itself in the
toils of a Chinese problem even more
costly and menacing than the Philippina
probltm Itself.

For Vice President, Archibald Murray

conquest. On the other hand Is a public opin
ion Fwa\ed by Jtmapogic appeals to factional
ami dJtaa Dasslims. the most fatal of diseases
to a republic. We believe that either of these
influences, if unchecked. -* - ould ultimately com
pass the downfall of our country, but we also
believe that neither represents the sober con
viction of our countrymen.
Convinced that the extension of the Jurisdic
tion of the United States for the purpose of
holding foreign people as colonial dependencies
is an Innovation dancerous to our liberty and
rerugr.ant to the principles upon which our
Government Is founded, we pledge our effortb
through all constitutional means.
Firstâ To procure the renunciation of all Im

foreign countries claimed to have been acquired

operations of the last two years.
Secondâ We further pledge our efforts to se

Thirdâ To secure a public service based on
merit only.
Fourth â To secure the abolition of all cor

SECRETARY GAGE MAKES
REPLY TO CARL SCHURZ
CALJO BUREAU, WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Sept. o. â No withdrawal of troops from Pe
king is now likely in the opinion of diplomats hero, based upon official information which has been re
ceived in Washington. There seenis to be practical unanimity of opinion among the powers outside of
Russia that a blunder would be committed if the Russian plan was adopted. Germany is understood to have
replied to the St. Petersburg note, stating that she deemed it unwise to allow her troops tÂ» leave Peking be
cause all the purposes which led the allies to seize the Chinese capital have not yet been carried out. The Ger
man Government furthermore calls attention to the position of native Christians, who, if abandoned to the
mercies of the imperial Government, would probably be as ruthlessly slaughtered as were thousands of their
faith before the occupation.
Italy and Austria have replied along the same lines as Germany. Great Britain is known to agree
that the interests of all nations demand the retention of the troops in Peking. Nothing definite as to the
attitude of Japan can be learned, but it is inferred that she would pref Â»r that the allies remain for the pres
ent. With all the powers, except Russia and possibly France, agreed as to the desirability of retaining troops
in Peking it is plain that Russia's proposal will not be adopted.
A diplomat who discussed the situation to-day pointed out that Russia's real purpose had probably
been achieved. That purpose, he thought, was to imprsss iipon China the deep interest in her welfare felt by
Russia. And having shown such disinterestedness, and the other powers having decided on remaining in
Peking, Russia can now say to China that in China's interest as well as her own it is advisable for the
Russian troops to stay.
There is reason to believe that some of the powers have submitted counter proposals in modification of
the Russian plan. As soon as Russia formally announces the withdrawal of her proposal negotiations will be
begun to determine the force each power shall retain in Peking. After that will come the all-important ques
tion'of terms the powers will demand of China. The State Department is being kept well informed of the
situation in Southern China and the authorities appear confident that unless some unfavorable development
occurs in the north the southern Viceroys will be able to maintain order.

draw from China is due to a desire on the part of the

hoped the* Kaiser will show forth his trust in the effi

SENATOR WELLINGTON of Maryland, in a
public speech on the platform with Bryan, has
denounced the Republican party, which elected
him to the Senate, and declared himself, for this cam
paign at least, a Bryanite. The action was not un
expected. The Senator has long been known to be
opposed to expansion nnd to the administration, and,
being a man of considerable aggressiveness, it was
foreseen he would come out into the open to fight in
stead of sulking in his tent and growling.
In Maryland, where Wellington's character is best
understood, it is asserted his opposition to the ad
ministration is due not so much to the so-called
"imperialism" involved in the Philippine policy as
j to a personal grudge against McKinley for refusing
to place the entire Federal patronage of Maryland in
his hands. Wellington, it appears, aspires to rule
alone as absolute boss of the Republican party of
Maryland, and, finding his ambition balked by the
I President, has turned against him with all the rage
of a proud man who has been humiliated in his own
\ camp.
Be that as it may, the country will judge Welling-
I ton by his own statement. He has thus far said noth
i ing showing personal animosity to the President, He
; claims to be acting upon political grounds only, and
i is entitled to a hearing on those grounds. In his
; speech of Tuesday he is reported to have said he sees
, no reason to fear any changes in the tariff or in the
I money laws of the country resulting from the election
; of Bryan. To him the one issue is that of imperialism.
: On that point he said: "I cannot see my way clear
j to inveigh against imperialism, against the unconsti
j tutionality of the Porto Rico tariff bill, the unrigln
| eousness of attempting to enslave the inhabitants of
j the Philippine Islands and the dishonor of breaking
our pledge to Cuba, and then, because of the
I mandate cf a sinister influence which domi
j nates the President, forswear my convictions.
I set at naught my declarations, and do, as did
Â¦ Senator Hoar and othersâ appeal to the past and
j the future. The past is dead. I cannot change it.
No appeal will reach its deaf ear. The future is not
in my keeping, and it is not in my power to fashion
I it. Therefore I am here to-night to reiterate the
i convictions I voiced in the Senate and record my
I opposition to the principles of President McKinley as
i evidenced in his foreign policy, and with all the
1 vehemence of a positive nature protest against the
violation of the principles upon which our Govern
j ment is founded; against the desecration of the con
1 stitution and the reversal of the policy which has
I given us a century and a quarter of national prosper
j ity such as the history of man has not recorded in
I any age or clime."
As that is Wellington's own defense of himself, it
I may be accepted as the best that can be made. Its
I weakness will be apparent to every one who gives it
I a moment of serious consideration. When he declares
J that the election of Bryan would bring about no
SENATOR WELLINGTON'S BOLT.
Industrial disturbances and financial panic are too
serious matters to be provoked merely to serve the
ambition of a quite worthless young man to be. Presi
dent. His service to his country is so far lacking, and
certainly does not deserve a reward paid at such a
frightful cost.
All this is on Colonel Bryan's programme. He is
now agonizing about putting the dollar above the
man. If he get the power to carry out his fanatical
schemes the dollar and the man will not be within
speaking distance for many a year to come, and when
the man catches the dollar at last it may be only 45
cents, and many only 30 cents, for the greenback dol
lar fell nearly that low during the war.
Let every business man and every laboring man
think it over and ask himself if there is no disturb
ance of industry, and no harm to the country, in
electing a man to the Presidency who is pledged to
destroy our monetary standard, obsolete our bank
ing system and inflate the currency with an unlimited
issue of irredeemable greenbacks? If the industrial
depression of 1893 began in a fear of changes in the
tariff, what are we to expect from a change in the
tariff supplemented by a slump to the silver standard,
the closing of all our banks of issue, the emission of
an inflated credit currency, and, on top of it all, such
a disposition of the Philippine issue as reopens the
settlement of the Civil War and plunges the country
into discussion of a motion for a new trial of the
Southern Confederacy?
Even as to the Philippines he has invented a theory
that makes their alienation a dissolution of tha
Union and reopens the sectional sores of - three
quarters of a century.
This is equivalent to saying that if elected he will
not try to do anything that he has promised to do,
for there is harm in nearly all of it.
THE supporters of Colonel Bryan are engaged in
pooh-poohing what they call "the scare of
1896," and in assuring the country he cannot do
any harm if he is elected.
THE HARM IN BRYAN.
BARK MELANOPE IN
PORT WITHOUT OWNER
Captain Cragen and a Young Lady
Die on the Last
Voyage.
The British bark Melanope is in the
stream awaiting judgment as to her
ownership. John R. Cragen, captain of
the vessel, died last August. On the ar
rival of the Melanope the Pubiic Adminis
trator applied for letters of administration
upon the, estate of., the dead captain.
Later three children of tho deceased liv
ing in Orange, N. J.. applied foe letters.
It is said that Captain Cragen transferred
his interest in the vessel to Mias El-ia
Mabel Taylor, who accompanied him on
his trip to this coast. Miss Taylor diÂ«-d
at Panama of fever. If it is found that
the transfer of the vessel to Miss Taylor
was legal her relatives in England "will
be searched for, if otherwise the vessel
will pass into the har.r's of the children.
It is claimed that Miss Taylor, who was
reputed to be wealthy, advanced the
money for the purchase of the vessel by
Captain Cragen.

Right to Serpentine Av3nue.
The City Attorney advised the Board of
Supervisors on Tuesday tbat the city has
a right to Serpentine avenue and it should
act upon. this assumption until the courts
have otherwise declared. He does not
know of any power the board has to give
a deed to a certain portion of the lands
within the lines of the avenue to Chris
tian Hellinff, who lays claim to It. An
act of 1878 requires the board to sell at
Eublic auction to the highest bidder all of

to San Bruno road.
Telephones' for Fire Service.
Rolla V. "Watt, president of the Fire
Commissioners, has made arrangements
with the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph
Company under which the telephones used
by the department will be allowed to re
main in use until provision is made by the
Russia's New Calendar.
It is cnid that Russia Is about to adopt a
new calendar. Each year contains 13 months of
twenty-eight days each, and beslns on Mon
day and ends en Saturday. â¢ The main feature
of this calendar is its apparent stability, and. in
this it resembles the sovereign remedy, Hos
tetter'a Stomach Bitters, which has held an
immovable position for half n century. Try a
for Indigestion, dyspepsia, constipation, nerv
ousness or Insomnia, but be sure you get the
senulne.
\r ERMOM has cast her vote :or aiaie omcers,
L / and the re<u!t? r.fTord the first lest by which to
* estimate the driif"of public sentiment on the is
Â¦ rÂ« - now before the people. It has been the custom
to reeard Vermont as a barometer of public opinion
: â¢ ujrhout the country. The State election vir
[orecasts the Presidential election in Novem
ber. The normal Republican majority is 25,000; when
that majority is exceeded in the September election
Republicans arc assured the independent vote of the
country i^ with them; when it falls short of that
i'<purc Republican leaders know there is danger
ihead.
The majority of thia year falls short of what it was
four years aso, but exceeds that of two years ago. It
:<- thus easy to draw the conclusion that the over
whelming victory of ifyb will not be repeated in the
Fres:<iei;tial contest, but at the same time there is a
sufficient assurance that the party has recovered from
the re-action of the off year and will make a better
tfcowing than it did in 1898. when it nearly lost con
troi of the House of Representatives.
Reports from the State are to the effect that th*
Democrats nominated this year an exceptionally
strong Ticket and worked to win. The Republican?
were sanguine of success, and there was a marked
apathy among the rank and file. By reason of those
differences in the energies of the parties the Repub
lican vote is something like 20 per cent less than it
uas ::i rSg6j whi'e the Democrats gain something like
IJ per cent. Thus, while the result on the whole is
satisfactory, it contains a moral which Republicans
throughout the Union should take to heart and
profit by.
It appears clear that a considerable number of
Gold Democrats who refused to vote for Bryan in
1896 have returned to their party. That was not un
expected. The Democrat of Maine, Vermont and
New Hampshire is a peculiar creature. He is gener
ally a? sturdy as granite and just about as reasonable.
He can be moved by a political earthquake like that
which revolutionized Democracy in 1896, but as soon
as the shock is over he settles back to his old place.
He goes on nominating candidates and voting for
them with a dogged pertinacity, though he has never
elected one in forty years. He wiil continue to do so
as lorg as he lives, and then his children will take up
the party name nnd carry it on through the next gen
eration.
Next week Maine will hold a State election, and a
second test vote will be submitted for the study of
politicians. It is Ukerj to be much m-Â»re interesting
than that in Vermont, for Maine is not so steadfast as
her sister State. It will be remembered that in 1880,
when Garfield was candidate for the Presidency, the
people of Maine in their State election actually gave
the Democrats a plurality. That was about the big
gest scare in the history of American politics. It
roused the Republican leaders and set them to work
with a vim to make wp for 3os^ time. The work was
?o effective that Garfkld carried Maine and the rest
of the country as well.
A close vote m Aiaire would probably be an ex
cellent thing for the Republican party this year.
From ail parts of the East come reports of over
confi(!cr.ce in the party ranks, while the Democrat?
.ire working like beavers pven in States like Vermont,
where they have only a forlorn hope to fight for. It
is clear there is to be no walkover this year. A dt
clinc in the Republican vote and an increase in tho
Democratic vote augurs ill in States where the mar
fin of Republican victory was narrow in 1806
The generosity with which Democratic plug uglics
are aiding Herrin, Crimmins and Kelly in their assault
upon reputable Republican methods suggests that the
Phclanhe crop of the "'push" must be extremely large
this year.
Cornelius Vandcrbilt is. after all, one of the "boys,"
a good every-dav sort of an American. He has an
rour.ced a willingness to accept a seat in Congress
if the people will give it to him.

Not Have Any Injurious
Effect.
The report of Dr. Adolph A. Poehner,
made to Coroner Cole yesterday, lays the
death of Ruby Kayser, 4 months old. at
the feot of her sister Eva. 3Vi years old. 1
Dr. Poohner gave the cause o: death as!
peritonitis, following: an abscess caused
by a playful blow from Eva two weeks
ago.
The parents of the c~.ead baby, Mr. and
Mrs. Charles Kayser of 412 Octavia street, j
visited the Morgue yesterday and ex- .;
pressed the greatest indignation that the .'
death of their baby should have been :
made a Coroner's case. They said that
Dr. Poehner had informed them that the
infant was afflicted with brain fever. Â«t

upstairs having died of that complaint.
Mrs. Kayser stated that while Baby j
Ruth was In her carriage, wrapped In a ;

hand, but not hard cnouRh to injure h^r. ;
"The doctor told me," said Mrs. Kayser, I

From the way the ordinance is framed it appears
the clause forbidding any one to permit an escaped
Belgian hare *to remain at large applie-s to every citi
zen in the county. The moment notice is given of
the escape and flight of a hare all persons must set
forth in pursuit of him. Still more imperative will it
be upon any one who happens to see a free hare to
get out and hunt him down. There is seemingly no
exception to the operation of the law. Each offender
is liable to a fine not exceeding $100 or imprisonment
in the County Jail for a period not exceeding thirty
days.
The results are likely to be interesting. A preacher
coming late to church will explain. '"Brethren, the
devil set a hare along the road and I had to stop to
catch him." Young men and maidens expected home
by early twilight will return late and explain, "We had
to help run down a Belgian." Jurymen will not get to
court in time because of the necessity of pursuing
stray hares on the way. Altogether, there is going
to be a fine time in San Diego â races every day and
hare for supper every night. Moreover, there is a
prospect the sport will last a long time. One expert
has figured out that the increase from one pair of
Belgian hares will amount to 1,723.846 hares in ten
years. It will be seen that there's lots of fun ahead.
OUT of San Diego there may be expected to
come in the next year or two a more dazzling
aggregation of unrivaled sprinters and match
less long distance runners than were ever seen in any
part of the known world by any generation living or
dead. The cause for the development of the fleet
footedness in the county is to be found in an ordi
nance which according to reports was adopted on
Tuesday. The ordinance makes it unlawful for any
person to liberate Belgian hares in the county or to
permit any which may have escaped to remain at large
or .unconfined. It will be comparatively easy for the
owner of a Belgian hare to prevent him from escap
ing, but the clause which forbids any citizen to allow
one to remain at liberty after having escaped is goin^
to require some tall running on the part of the pubiic.

The Wells-Fargo war tax case was ar
gued before the Supreme Court yesterday
by Attorney General Tirey L. Ford, repre
senting the people, and E. S. Pillsbury for
the corporation. The action was origin
ally brought by the former Attorney Gen
eral, who sought to make the transporta
tion company carry the parcels of its
patrons without compelling the latter to
pay the one cent war tax. In the lower
court the action was defeated. Mr. Pills
bury based his defense on a recent de
cision of the United States Supreme Court
in a similar case, which resulted in favor
of the transportation company.
After the case was submitted to the fau
preme Court and after the briefs were all
tiled the Supreme Court of the Uniteo.
States decided what is known as the
"Michigan case." which presented ques
tions quite similar to the ones presented,
here. In the Michigan case, however. It
appeared that the rates of transportation
were raised by the express company just
one cent in every instance to cover the
one cer.t required by the internal revenue
law. The Supreme Court of the United
States held that this the express company
had a perfect right to do, provided their
rates as thus laised were not unreason
able, and the pleadings in the case showed
that they were not unreasonable.
Attorney General Ford, however, argued
that the case here in California can be
distinguished from the Michigan case in
thisâ that in Michigan the rates were
raised to cover the one cent, whereas in
California the rates remain the same, but
the one cent is demanded of the shipper
as a prerequisite to the forwarding of his
parcel or package.
The matter was taken under advisement
bv the court.

Not only is the domestic price of lumber advan
cing, but the foreign demand increases with the rise
in Europe. No better interest can be had upon capi
tal than by investing it in forest land and preserving
the trees, to be harvested when ripe, without damage
to the growing crop.
There are thousands of acres in California that are use
less for other purposes that will harvest vast fortunes
if planted now in the ironwood eucalyptus, and there
are also thousands that will yield a rich return if
planted in the Catalpa speciosa, for railroad ties and
dimension timber. The hog wallow lands of the
lower foothills, so costly to level and often so rebel
lious to tillage, may in a few years be clothed with
forest, with the most grateful effect upon the moisture
and fruitfulne?s of the valley lands.
As for our mountain forests, one sickens at 'the
sight of their destruction. Every summer money is
burned in the mountains to the amount of millions.
The merchantable timber that stands is destroyed a:id
the fine crop of young trees that was following to
take its place is reduced to ashes and the still dormant
germs in the soil are burned to death. So a forest is
murdered in its cradle, and the splendid and perma
nent lumber supply to which the world will turn mor*
and more, and for which it will bid higher and
higher, will soon be exhausted and that source of
wealth will disappear.
These conditions admonish the people of the
United States to be wise in time and secure the per
manence of their forefts. Destruction has rioted
here rampant, but our forest area was so extensive
that it is not too late to preserve it to permanence
and make it produce the most valuable of all crops.
For many years t\\: lumber used in Europe has
been of very small dimensions, looking, in width,
much " like our roofing shakes. The wide boards,
yrcat planks and immense dimension timber so
common here are unknown there.
The attempt to make forest growth a permanent
crop has been going on in Europe only about a cen
tury. But the use of timber began centuries before
Caesar bridged the Rhine, and the demand has
grown with population and advanced with civilization,
until Europe is at last face to face with a timber
famine that reaches into many lines of commerce and
rffects the course and the profits of trade in many
ciirections.
This condition is general throughout Europe.
The replanting of forests and preservation of grow
ing timber have not kept pace with the consumption
of wood and the destruction of timber.
Labor in the manufactories of Sonneberg has com
manded a wage of $j 57 to $3 80 per week, and has
struck for an advance of 47 cents a week. Many em
ployers have already conceded the advance, which is
at once carried forward to the consumer, by being
added to the price of the goods. The concession of
the rise is expected to become general in the district
of which Sonneberg is the center, so that all iA ex
ports will be affected by the new condition of wages.
Another cause of the rise, which is of special interest
in the United States, is the steady and recently rapid
rise in the price of lumber. This affects the trade
throughout. The wood used in the articles manu
factured, the wood pulp used in the papier-mache of
which doll heads and torsos are made, and the boards
used to make the packing-boxes, all have advanced.
The advance in prices, of which customs officers in
this country have been notified to guide them in
liquidating invoices, is due to two causes, a labor
strike and steady advance in the price of lumber.
Sonnebcrg is a toy-making center, and manufac
tures also other articles of wood and glass. It is in
Saxe-Meiningen, on the river Rothen, and is such
an ancient seat of the industry upon which its people
live that its goods ere known* in trade, the world
over, as "Sonneberger ware." With a population of
about 10,000, it exports millions of dollars' worth of
its wares.
THE Treasury Department has received notice
from Sonneberg, Germany, that the values in
consular invoices must be advanced on im
ports to this country from that place.

j Senator Wellington has chosen to shut his eyes,
and is a uew proof of the old saying, "None so blind
as him who won't see." He has of course destroyed
his political future past redemption, but that is not
much to mourn over. After all his election to the
Senate was but a political accident, and when he
passes he never will be missed.
Senator Hoar and ex-Senator Edmunds have been
as earnest opponents of "imperialism" as ever Sena
tor Wellington can hope to be, but they are not fan
atics. They do not permit that. one issue to blind
them to every other issue of the time. Both have de
clared the election of Bryan would be more danger
ous and more disastrous to the country than anything
else that could befall it. In a recent interview with
the New York Herald Edmunds said: "I believe the
good of the country demands the re-election of Mc-
Kinley. I suppose expansion is his greatest vice, and
I do not really know that he is an expansionist." He
added: "Altgeld may be honest, and Bryan may be
honest; I believe, for that matter, that the majority
of anarchists are honest, but it is the ideas they have
and which they try to carry- out that make them un
safe."
change in the tariff or the currency, he virtually de
clares Bryan's pledges and those of the Kansas City
convention to be worthless. He discredits the asser
tions of Bryan on two important issues of the time,
but asks the people to believe all that Bryan says on
another issue. The unreasonable nature of such a
request is augmented by the fact that on the ques
tion of free trade and free silver Bryan has been con
sistent, but on the Philippine question he has not
been consistent. He urged the ratification of the
treaty that put us in possession of the Philippines and

THOUGHT THEIR FIND
WAS A SACK OF GOLD
Workmen Uncover Midwinter Fair
Souvenirs at the Bottom of
Lake Lagunitas.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX RAFAEL, Sept. 5.â Pour men who
are taking advantage of the low water a\
this season in Lake Lagunltas to clear
the bottom of the lake, of rushes and
leaves yesterday thought that their for
tunes were made when they discovered
a sack of what appeared to be $20 gold
pieces among the rushes at the bottom of
ihe lake.
Thomas Hollomn was Industriously
mowing the rushes when his scytheblade
rang against something metallic. Upon
investigation it proved to be a salt sack
full of shining pieces similar in appear
ance to Uncle Sam's double eagles. The
heart of Holloran beat faster and he was
promptly joined by Lawrence Welch and
Jack O'Brien. The pack was removed to
the bank and its contents emptied Into a
bucket. The supposed coins proved to bo
brass souvenirs of the late Midwinter
Fair.
How and why the souvenirs came to be
planted in the lake will perhaps never be
known. From the appearance of some of
tjie pieces it would appear that a clumsy
attempt at milling and gold-plating had
been made. Several pieces of broken
plaster of paris were found on the bottom
near the sack and the theory here is that
some would-be counterfeiter, disgusted
with his workmanship, concluded to bury
the evidence of his wrongdoing in the
waters of the lake.

is free from the fanciful ingenuity of the
designer. Far into the renaissance bronzo
candelabra were notable objects of art.
In the time of Louis XVI they were copied
in silver gilt, and classic imitations in
this same material were prominent in
Italy during the eighteenth century.
Different climatic conditions and differ
ent oils have necessitated great variety In
the construction ami decoration of lamps.
The limpid oils of the present day would
have solidified in the northern climates,
where whale and seal oils were the staple.
When these were superseded by vcgetablo
oils extracted from nuts and seeds a
change was made in the general design
of lamps, and when mineral oils, such aÂ»
paraffin, petroleum and colza, were suc
cessfully used quite a revolution was ef
fected. Many oi the early brass and sil
ver lamps In the larger Roman Catholin
churches of Europe had the wicks on the
edge of the vessel in a groove or corruga
tion or spout made for the purpose. Th<>
Fame general principle was employed In
the construction of the lamps in thÂ«
mosques of Damascus and Cairo, often
times made of splendid enameled glass or
Persian decorated pottery. Exquisitely
beautiful, too, were the Moorish hanging
lamps, made of pierced openwork In
bronze and bearing the date of the heglra.
To make the candle portable and to pro
tect it from draught and rain, the lan
tern was invented. Tradition ascribes trÂ»
Alfred the Great the invention of a cruilo
lantern clock. By protecting the candles
with thin pieces of horn he was enabled
to gauge thp hours by the time which the
candles took to burn. The word lantern,
however, ia of old Greek origin. The lar.
thorn mentioned by Shakespeare had ono
side shaded or smoked in order to conceal
the carrier. Architecturally, a lantern
was an invention of the renaissance, a
construction surmounting a dome as a
flnial and admitting liarht from th<=- sid^s.

tern of St. Peter's, designed by Michael

Special Dispatch to The CalL
SEATTLE. Sept. 5.â The miners of the Porcupine district, Alaska, have received from Secretary of State Hay definite
assurance that "this Government foregoes no part of its right and power to protect Its citizens in the Porcupine
Creek region, whether they be temporarily within American or British jurisdiction, In the full enjoyment of all rights
and privileges which they had before the modus vlvendi was concluded, and to see that their freedom of access and
exit, with their goods, is not unreasonably impeded."
This announcement is the result of the petition to President McKlnley from 140 American miners in the Porcupine
country, who complained of being brought within the territory and under the laws of the Dominion of Canada, and es
pecially protested against the location of the boundary line along the Kiehini River, by which American mrners were
forced to enter British territory In carrying supplies to their camps. Secretary Hay discusses the proposition at length.
He assures the miners that the modus Vivendi is merely a temporary proposition, to be abrogated without prejudice to
cither party when a permanent settlement of the boundary is decided upon; that in the meantime the rights of all miners
temporarily within the Canadian control will be religiously protected, and that miners desiring to carry goods through the
disputed territory will be permitted to do bo without interference from the Canadian customs officials.
Mr. Hay goes on to say that the argument of statements presented in the petition were fully discussed, and the circum
stance that the negotiation of a modus vlvendi was prolonged for two years before an agreement was reached was due to
the Insistence of this Government that no solution was admissible which should not recognize and guard all rights and
privileges gained by the American miners and other citizens who had ssttled in the disputed territory. He says:
I Inclose for your information a copy of modus vlvendi of October 20, 1899. I beg you to observe:
Firstâ That the arran=oment Js provisional merely and without prejudice to the claims of either party In the permanent adjust
ment cf the international boundary. .Â¦;-' Â¦.Â¦,;-'
Secondâ That the inconvenience of a provisional line crossing and recrossing the shifting waterway is foreseen and expressly
provided for by the agreement that persons proceeding to or from Porcupine Creek shall be freely permitted to follow the trail between
the Eald creek and the said Junction of the rivers OCieheni and Chllkat) Into and across the territory on the Canadian side of the tem
porary line, whenever the trail crosses to such side, and subject to such reasonable regulations for the protection of the revenue as
the Canadian Government may prescribe, to carry with them over such part or carts of the trail between the said points as may
lie on the Canadian side of the temporary line such goods and articles as they desire without beinsr required to pay. any customs
duties on such coods and articles. Â¦ .
Thirdâ And most imix>rtant in Its relation to the grounds of your protest, that It Is stipulated that the citizens or subjects of
either power found by this agreement within the temporary jurisdiction of the other shall suffer no diminution of their rights and
privileges which they now enjoy.
In closing Secretary Hay says:
The rights of the United States in the matter of the treaty boundary are absolutely Intact, and their assertion In due time will
be earnest and thorough.

SACRAMENTO. Sept. 5.â Sheriff John
son, who has complete charge of the in
vestigation into the sensational Folsom
murders, reported to-night to The Call
correspondent that there were absolutely
no developments touching the motive or
identity of the assassin.
The Sheriff was amused at a story which
appeared in a Snn F"rancisco newspaper
to-rlay about some "mysterious man,
manifestly insane," wandering on a road
near Folsom without shoes and wrapped
in a quilt, and with an ominou3 dirk se
cured to his waist.
"As a matter of fact," said Sheriff John
son. "I heard of this man being seen and
had one of my deputies look him up. He
was found to be a hobo, who had taken
off his shoes in order to wash his feet.
This was on Tuesday, nearly a week after
the murders. "
The tield for speculation as to who mur
dered Hans Rasmupsen and "William Tay
lor in their lonely and far-separated
abodes is practically limitless, but all the
theories advanced do not avail to clarify
the perplexing mystery. No man knows
more about the investigation than Sheriff
Johnson, but that official ia unwilling to
commit himself unequivocally to an ex
planation of the crimes. As has been said
in The Call, the most definite statement
that can be made in the case la that the
double crime bears every evidence of hav
ing been committed by pome one not only
well acqualntei with the lay of the coun
try, hut having a thorough personal fa
miliarity with the premises occupied by
the victims. The thought that robbery
was contemplated is not to be considered
for a moment. Nothing was disturbed at
either house, though the isolation of both
would have permitted of their being ran
sacked without fear of Interruption.
The suicide theory Is equally as absurd.
The number and location of the wounds
and the absence of weapons remove all
likelihood of self-murder. There remains
the single motive â revenge.
Both men were given to the use of
liquor. AVhen last seen alive in the town
of Folsom. three mlle,s away, they were
Indulging in liquor. One of them pur
chased and carried away a bottle of
whisky. It Is not hard to believe that
while in this condition one of the men
quarreled with a third person, who may or
may not have been under the influence
of liquor also; that this third person
killed Rasmussen. and afterward, to in
sure his own safety, took the life of the
only witness to the deed, Taylor.
It may be said at this time that one
man is suspected of the crime, that he
lives in the locality of the murders ana
Â¦ that he will be watched. To cause an ar
rest at this time in the absence of rea
sonable evidence would be foolish, and
Sheriff Johnson will not act hastily. The
scene of the murders is not a place visitea
by strollers through the country, and this
fact tends somewhat to confirm the belief
that the murderer, whoever he Is. does not
live very far distant from the scene of hla
crimes.

Present Boundary Only Temporary and Interfereece

cials Will Not Be Tolerated,
BY MARGARET AINSLEE,
It is a far cry from the most primitive !
form of lampâ skulls of animals in which j
fat was burnedâ to the modern electric >
light, yet while the recent contrivance un- '.
doubtedly holds the palm as an Uluminant i
Its dazzling glare lacks, utterly the sub- j
duing poetic effect vested in the older
fashioned light-giver:^. More romantic
than the skull lamp was the primeval I
seashell, and to this day* the variety of j
shell known as the "roaring buckie" 13 j
suspended as a lamp in many a northern j
peasant's cottage. The artistic possibili
ties of the hanging shell appealed to the
early Greeks and Romans, who copied it
in bronze and precious metals for their
lamps called "lucernae." At first these
"lucernae" were made, of the commonest
pottery, with but one wickhole. So
feeble was the light emitted by the flax
tow or other vegetable fiber used as wicka
that their number was Increased so that
as many as twelve wicks" frequently con
tributed to the lamp's light-giving power.
The Romans observe! the custom of ex
changing New Year's giftsâ small coins
for good luck or honeycomb as an em
blem of sweetness; but the favorite gift
was a golden or bronze lamp, which by us
richness or novelty should commend itself
to the recipient/ Consequently neither
expense nor Ingenuity was spared In the
search for unique "lucernae." The mus
eums are rilled with rare iUruscan iamp-s
of bronze, richly adorned with relief
sculpture. From the excavations at Her
culaneum and Pompeii we find lamps even
more delicate and tasteful than the Etrus
can specimens. Some were tall and state
ly, reminding us In general proportion of
the piano lamp, which we fondly imagine
a recent institution. Among the wealthy
Romans, the lamp gentrally hung from or
rested upon the candelabrum, and hardly
any articles of furniture were more beau
tifully wrought than these Roman lamp
stands. They were generally of architec
tural design, columnar in form, quaintly
and elegantly carved Jn marble. They
usually stood on the ground and weie

ing week last year.
A very small business has been transacted In
the wool market since a week ago, the entire
eales not aggregating over a million and a half
pounds. There is little life to the demand. Tha
dullness has been Intensified by the intervention
or a holiday, business being practically sus
pended from Friday night until Tuesday. The
rank and tile of the trade are holding prices
pretty stea ly, although there are weak spots
here and there, but they are not sufficiently
pronounced to warrant any lowering of quota
tions and they would quickly disappear If there
was a good, healthy demand for wool. The
situation abroad is no different from what it
la here.

Rev. J. J. Prendergast Believes Sim
ple Explanation on Religious
Mattel's' More Convincing.
The Very Rev. J. J. Prendergast gave
the monthly lecture before the Catholic
â¢Truth Society at St. Mary's Cathedral
last evening. He spoke of the tendency
of the American people to criticize men
ami issues without any logical reason.
The people become prejudiced and refuÂ»e
to accept un explanation. This was esnÂ«
cially true of the two great political paT
ties. he said. *
Judgments, the speaker said, are formed
very largely by our own selfish fnter.st4
and prejudices. While political, eco
nomic, civic and financial issues mfjrht h*
dealt with in this way, the subject of â¢
liglon must be handled differently
"The problem of religion is much more
completing to the human mind," contin
ued the speaker. "Controversies should
be avoided In teaching religion. A almole
explanation is far better and more lm
pr^sslve than a heated argument. If y ou
enter into a debate with a man the
chances are he will become more hard
ened and set against what you are trv
ing to impress upon him than he was bel
fore you said anything."

DENMAN BENT ON DISCIPLINING
THE PRINCIPALS AND TEACHERS
IF any principals have filled up classes with more than fifty-five pupils they
have violated a rule of the Board of Education, which sets that number as
the limit of 'enrollment, and they should be disciplined. If they or the
teachers have done so the fault is theirs, not ours, and they are responsible."
These words were uttered by Director Denman at yesterday's meeting
of the Board of Kducatlon. They gave evidence of the fact that the board is
weakening in its policy of a high clarification. Chairman Mark had just fin
ished throwing a few bouquets at the new order for classification Issued by the
board and b-ised on the reports of principals for August.
"It is the best classification that could be made." said Mark. "The classes
are not crowded, and If any Injustice has been done it will be rectified after
the schools have been visited."
â¢'I have received information." said Superintendent Webster, "that classes
in two schools have over fifty-five pupils."
Then It was that Denman was for disciplining the two principals for allow
ing such a high enrollment.
Webster then notified the board that under the terms of the charter, which
vested the power of classification In vhe Superintendent of Schools, he would
send out his deputies to Investigate the conditions as they existed. On their
findings he would make his official report to the board, containing whatever
recommendations he saw fit to make:
Webster was Informed that the board had settled or.ce and for all the
transfer of the grammar grades from the Grant to the Pacific Heights school
and that its action was irrevocable. Ihe Superintendent quoted section 1662 of
the Political Code, which provides that every school must be opened to chil
dren between 6 and 21 years of age, and said pupils were barred from the
schools named on account of the new grading. Webster then asked to have
his protest against the juggling of the grades duly recorded. He was further
Informed that the petition of' the German residents requesting the restoration
of physical culture In the schools was "under consideration" by tho board.
Webster notified the board that a large number of parents had requested
that their children, who are pupils of the seventh and eighth grades, be excused
from taking cooking lessons. Allegations were made that the other work was
neglected and that parents had stated that they themselves could teach their
daughters all the cooking necessary.
Courteous Anarchist Mistook Godi for L'Htalia's
Editor and Was Prepared to Lay Him Low '
With a fiuge Revolver.
Aonni, a printer, employed oy I/Italla, ran up apainst a courteous
highwayman at an early hour Tuesday morning while on his way to
o work, and he i.Â« still suffering from the shock.
"Stop." cried the man of the road, shoving a bright and shining
revolver right under the printer'^ no."=e.
Godl without further invitation obeyed the command. lie went even a
step further and threw up his type-grimmed hands. The man with the gun
looked for a moment Into the Godl orbs, put up his pun and with a polite
"siouff me," took to his heels. .
G^dl was too frlphtened to appreciate the would-be assailant's courtesy,
or even to collect his wits sufficiently to tako note whether the man with the
weapon was tall or short or darn or fair. AH he knows Is that when the
etran*rer ran from him two men on the other side of the street also took to
their heels. When Oodi reached the Italia's composing rooms he was so flus
tered by his meeting with the polite highwayman that he begged off work and
under escort went home to recuperate from the nervous shock.
Godl bumped apalnst the polite crook on Montgomery avenue, almost in
front of the Commercial Hotel, early on Tuesday morning. The matter wa3
immediately reported to the police, and Detective Reynolds was put on the
case.
Reynolds has u theoryâ and he se^s In the mannerly hold-up man an an
archist roaming about in a vengeful mood.
Shortly after the shootlnirr of Italy's King. L'ltalla began the publishing
of a series of forceful articles in which the anarchists were bitterly de
nounced. ThÂ» little band of resident anarchists naturally took offense at the
tone of the editorials and it was whispered that Editor Patrlzl had better
have a care. Godl resembles Palrlzl In height and build only, and the police
maintain that the pistol that chilled the printer's blood was intended to spill
the Patrizl gore.
No arrests have been made.

On the last occasion there were no fish

Supervfsor Samuel Kraunhart ha_Â« defi- |

Frederick A. Wundenberg is a very
wealthy Hawaiian supar planter. The
plaintiff is Mrs. Julia A. Ca'houn. the
widow of the late Dr. J. G. Calhoun of
Willows. Mrs. Calhoun Is a handsome
woman and is possessed of a considerable
estate left by her husband, so that she
was independent when she met Wunden
bercr.
The suit was brought on March 1. 1300.
and has b<=-en pending ever since. Just as
the suit was brought Wundenhersr l^ft
California for the Hawaiian Islands in
order to avoid service, and this caused n
great deal of delay. The cas? Is still
pending upon some demurrers filed by
Wundenberg: to the service of the sum
mons by publica-tion. but the dismissal is
ready to be filed, and the deeOs in the
compromise are already of record.
OAKLAND, Sept. 5.-Mrs. Julia A.
[| V Calhoun has won every point in
\ i=: J/ her suit against Frederick A. Wun
denb^rg "for breach of promise, and
the deeds to the pro;>erty In dispute have
been placed upon record In this county.
The millionaire Hawaiian sugar planter
haa compromised the suit brought by the
lady and a settlement In full has been
made. The lady receives the property at
C41 Filbert street, the house and furniture
and a substantial cash payment which,
while not the full amount of $50,000 sued
for. very nearly approaches that sum.
Mrs. Calhoun believes that It was Mr.
Wundf-nberp's family that caused the
breach between them.
Then Mrs Calhoun noticed that there
came a change In his letters, and at last
they stopped altogether. Then the agents
ami attorneys began trying to dispossess
her. ar.d the suit for the property and
the breach of promise action resulted.
Then Wundenberg began negotiations
for a compromise, with the result noted.
Wundenberg later proposed that they
marry and settle down in Oakland. He
agreed to settle upon her a house and lot.
$25,000 in sugar stock and other property.
She selected the house and lot, which was
purchased for 115,000, and furnished. Wun
denberg ordered his Â«K<?nt to put the
property in her name, but it was put in
his namp. thouprh she went to live there.
Wundenberp was at this lime In the Ha
waiian Islands.
w*lian Islands, where his sisters live, and
p^r.t for Mr?. Calhoun to visit them. Mrs
Calhuun finally decided that she would
make the trip. She went to Honolulu and
stayed at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel for
a month, durinc which time she visited
the family of Wundenbertr. and was re
ceived into thf> he*t society in the islands*.
It was during this trip that Wundenberg
proposed that they get married in Hono
lulu. To this Mrs. Calhouu demurred
upon the ground that his family might
think that ?ht> had followed him to Ho
no'.ulu In order to marry him. Wunden
btTK pleaded that he was compelled to go
to Australia, apd that he wanted the cer
emony performed before he went, but
Mrs. Calhoun replied that she would con
sider the matter upon her and his return
to San Francisco. So he went to Aus
tralia and ehe came back to San Fran
cisco.

The Board of Education was treated to
some interesting law points at yesterday's
meeting by Vice Principal Knowlton of the
Everett Grammar School, who claims to
have been arbitrarily suspended from his
position on an unfavorable report tiled by
Mrs. Banning, tlie principal or the school.
President Ihhtk stud lie nad been assured

who was present, wanted a public or pri
vate hearing.
"Let it be public by all means," said
Knowlton.
Casserly moved that the hearing be
taken up this morning at 10 a. m., but this
was objected to by Knowlton, who said:
"Vou bave heard, from the principal and
I have been summoned three times. I
submit that there have been no charges
legally formulated by the School Superin
tendent. 1 desire to know If the rule
granting the president power to suspend
was not adopted after my suspension was
ordered."
Knowlton then, read a statement
in which he claimed that the principal's
adverse report did not specify any of the
four causes Justifying suspension and that
Chairman Mark had no right to suspend,
even though a rule granting him the
power had been adopted. He quoted law
In support of his suspension. The hearing
was then postponed until this morning.
The action of the president In transfer

A resolution was presented b McCarthy
directing the attention of the Board of
Education to the charter provision requir
ing the Board of Public Works to make
all repair? to nchoolhouses. McCarthy
says that in this connection the Board of
Education has illegally appointed an In
spector of buildings at $125 p-^r month.
The School Board nlro persists in makin<
the repairs. McCarthy said that any
agreement between the two board* was
In direct violation of the charter, which
was clear on the point He also directed
the attention of th* Board of Public
Works to the provision placing the mat
ter of tearing up the streets solely in its
hands. The resolution was referred tu
the Judiciary Committee.

of Gr*pe-N'uts food, do vou know thrt I

â¢'Sir.ce the 'Millennium' came to our
cuifine we have no further occasion to
take into our stomachs the masses of
pasty, partly conked food that we used
before Grape-Nuts came. I speak di-
rectly of myself. I had been for a lon#
time the victim of gastric indigestion,
brought on by steady mental work and
a lack of proper food. I passed sleep-
less nights: and work in the davtime
Â¦was exceedingly difficult Many spells
of \-ertisÂ° came on and mv nerves and
temper were in anything but a normal
"I finally had three successive n!>ht
attacks and I verily thonfrht the end had
come. I would throw out at midnight
the lunrh of Scotch porridge eaten the
noon previous, unchanged, except that
it had turned intensely bitter. Violent
vomitincr continued for eight or ten
hour?, and the after-exhaustion was all
but <!eath!v.
A peculiar remark made by a minister
st a New England dinner caused some
comment. He was being served for the

looked t-p and asked what it was and
being told, said, "They might 'have
