looked in.
"What's this?" he said. William was
dumb. "Pack up your things and go,"
said the manager.
So William went to the office, dre-w the

v.cnt upstairs and put on his Sunday

the other servants he happened to ran
across the rrtanager, who did not recog

"Can you clean windows?"
"Yes, sir."

gave the last man 22 shillings, but I'll
give you 25."
"Thank you. sir," said William, and In
half an hour he was back In the same old

not reading the paper.

- : . From the Illustrated London News.
GOVERNMENT IS FULLY SATISFIED
THAT THE LEGATIONERS ARE SAVED
The German, French and Russian Charges d'Affalres called separately at the
State Department to-day. The situation was discussed, but no important
changes developed. "')'*":*â¢ -/Â¦Â¦-
The general policy of the Government toward China heretofore has been made
known both to General Chaffee and Minister Conger, and It was stated authori
tatively to-night that there was no necessity of -sending these officials additional
instructions. . Â¦ v'.:.
The fact is emphasized by administration officials that' the policy of the Gov
ernment Is stated in Secretary Hay's note of July 3, and that nothing can be
added now to the document except an elaboration of the points stated therein.
The dispatch from General Tamaguchl, giving the details of the capture of
Peking, was accepted by the War Department officials as giving the most satis
factory account thus far received. General Tamaguchi is in command " of the
Fifth Army Corps, with the rank of major general, and Is regarded as one of the
fighting generals of the Japanese armyi His report discloses for the first time
that the Americans shared In the assault on the city and that they" .marched
with the British troops to the south gate, while the Japanese and Russians oper
ated against the east gate. What was most noticeable in' the Japanese report
was that the Japanese killed are given at 10*) and the Chinese killed at 400.
" This gives no account of the wounded, and Indicates that when the detailed
list is received it will be a heavy one. as the wounded always far exceed the
killed. Furthermore, the report states that the loss of the allies "has not been
ascertained." This Is the first intimation that there were losses other than those
sustained by the Japanese. The entire tenor of the report Indicates that the
engagement was a fierce one. lasting throughout the day of 'August 13 as the
attack began early In the morning, and the blowing up of the gates did not
occur until nightfall. â¢ ; . 'â¢'â¢"-
Even with the Chinese capital occupied by the allied forces, it Is realized
that there is still serious business for the forces Inside the city While they
have reached the outer walls, which encircle the entire city, yet there are walla
within walls, and it remains to be seen whether an attempt will be made to
enter the imperial city, forming a distinct section of Peking proper The Inner
walls are comparatively, light. howeve>, not being above twenty feet h!Â«rh and
the military authorities say that they cannot even withstand light artillery If
there was any disposition to breach them. Moreover, -as the allied troops hav*
breached the great outer wall, fifty feet high and far more formidable than thÂ«
Inner walls, they would have comparatively little difficulty in moving where the
commanders desired in the city. !
Aside f row the question of withdrawal' of troops from China, there is thÂ«
further question of the withdrawal of troops from Peking. Both of these ques
tions are for the present iir abeyance, pending definite news from General Chaf
fee and Minister fconger. Certainly there can be no immediate withdrawal frmn
Peking, and the Government is yet to learn what plans will be devised for Â¦ eÂ£
cortlng the legationers and the Beveral thousand native Christians to the coast
While the Washington Officials < : Await Ad
vices From Peking Fresh Cause for Anxiety
Is Occasioned toy the Peculiar Complica
tions at Shanghai.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 18.â The Government, now fully satisfied by the
advices that the international troops have entered Peking and that the
legatloners are eaved, Is calmly awaiting detailed statements from Its
own officers. Dispatches were received to-day from General Barry at
Chefu and Consul General Goodnow at Shanghai repeating: the main
fact of the capture and relief. Neither General Chaffee nor Admiral Remey was
heard' from, however, and it is to them. â¢ particularly to , the American com
mander at Peking, that the Government looks for advices, not only on what has
Â¦ occurred, but on the local developments from which - an intelligent determination
can be made of what still remains to be done.
Tho President, Secretary Root, Acting Secretary of State Adee,' Acting Secre
tary of the Navy Hackett and other officials were in conference during the after
noon. It was said afterward that no additional details had come concerning
Peking, and It' was understood that the conference had to 'do with the situation
at Shanghai. Word reached the Navy Department during the afternoon that the
United , States cruiser New Orleans fiad reached Shanghai, at I which I point Brit
ish warships and transports are already In ;. force, " while the French, Russians
and Germans are j hurrying their men to the; same / destination. The American
Government so far has kept out of 'the entanglement, and in view of the re
ported landing of the troops by some of the. powers it was stated that the land
ing of 'American troops i had never been contemplated. ; Â¦.
Although the officials declined to give out any specific Information it Is un
derstood -generally : that the was, in i possession of word that land
ing of . British forces was begun to-day, and It was probable that this would
be followed by the landing of German and French forces. As these several forces
had as the ostensible purpose of their landing the maintenance of.peace and or
der it is not assumed to be likely thatianydlsordercan.arise from the course
pursued^ As a' result of the conference held to-day it is believed that a dispatch'
was f orwarded. to the commander of the New. Orleans advising him of the course
to be pursued:'' .'.' ; '. ! â¢ Â¦'Â¦â¢,Â¦Â¦ ..."_'-Â¦ .
The general situation at Shanghai, caused by the proposed landing of British
troops and the protests of Germany and France, continues to be strained, al
though the authorities are rather more hopeful ' of ' satisfactory adjustment than
heretofore.' â¢ " . 'Â¦ ' Â¦ . ;'-Â¦_Â¦.*Â¦ ' V ;
.-â¢, The; State" Department does not treat matter as at all grave, and regards
it rather as i a misunderstanding; one side -holding I that British activity is con

the whole Yangtse region. A One of the diplomatic officials; who has beenmost ac
tlvein the said . to-day, that in ') any. event \there could be no serious rup

Besides the Â£3.000,000 in gold attracted to'

Â£200.000 from India, it haa bought a fur
ther Â£2,500.000 which will shortly arrive.
end an inflow of Â£500,000 from the United

eecure over Â£4,000,000 and may Bucceed In
raising the reserve at the end of the week
to Â£23,000,000. The outflow of caeh from
London to the country usually reached
Â£4,000.000. During the last four months of
the vear we may be called on to find sev
f ral millions of gold for Egypt and and
Argentina and there Is little prospect of
more gold from New York.
With a reserve of Â£23,000,000, we may.
have to meet a demand of elx or seven
million pounds. Hence, later it may be
necessary to take further measures for
attracting gold or for diverting Egyptian
end South African demands for gold to
Parts or New York. Under these drcum
fctances It will be evident that any easei
of the London market must be of a tem

are In a position to withdraw a very large

First, the formal announcement that
troops would be landed; then a five days'

Shanghai wagged their heads and wired
to their home Governments, mutterings of
disapproval on the Continent and the
stirring- up of Chinese opposition at
Shanghai; troops arrive at Shanghai and
the Viceroy resists their landing, saying
that France and Russia object; the Con

Texas Fever Serum.
A discovery of much Interest to those
Who lose thousands yearly owing to the
cattle pest has been communicated to the
Academy of Medicine by M. Linniere, one
of the leading scientists on veterinary
subjects. He claims to be able to preserve
animals from Texas fever by producing
the disease In serum from animals which
have been previously attacked, thus at
tenuating the virulence and obtaining a
vaccine virus with which to inoculate and
protect cattle against fever.
The strike of the cabmen, which it was

responsibility, but on condition that both
sides should abide by his decision. This
the companies declined to do. The driv

been a brilliant success- -There are 4000

"The inhabitants of Clermont wish to
expreps to General Porter an acknowledg
ment of their respectful sympathy with
his nation and with him personally, and
to make declaration of that deep gratitude
for the prominent part he took in the suc
cess of their first fete, in assisting at their
banquet and speaking with eloquence and
such lofty sentiments as leave in the
hearts of those who heard him a profound
and durable souvenir.
"The Jnhabitants of Clermont' salute
GenerarPorter upon his departure, saying
to him not adieu, but au revoir."
United States Embassador Porter's par
ticipation in the fete in I the village of
Clermont recently was the occasion of
quite a Franco-American" demonstration.
It was the lirst time an American Embas
sador had ever visited the place. Just be
fore the departure of General Porter's
train for Paris a large delegation of na
tlvesAislted him and presented him with
tbclollowing memorial, signed by 160 citi
zens:

The occupation of Adrar, the principal
city of the Touat oasis of North Africa,
by General Serviere Is considered a suc

portance. General Serviere has now com
plete possession of three groups of Sa
haran oases, and this has been accom
plished without striking a blow, and It
would appear that the French are masters
of the region stretching between Algeria,
Tunisia. Tripoli and Morocco.
Success in North Africa.
"England has not been unmindful of the
close accord in which the events of the
last two months, by associations, social
and commercial, between the French and
American republics, through the Wash
ington and Lafayette monuments and the
visitors to the exposition, have brought
the two'sister republics," said a prominent
official, '.'and she is now using the same
methods pursued during the Spanish war
to turn aside this sentiment and Influence
American public opinion to the belief that
England Is the greatest friend' America
has aniong the European powers."
The annual reunion of Imperialists- and
royalists, which occurred on Wednesday
last, should not arouse great anxiety, for
the safety of the republic because of the
character of these meetings. The impe
rialists themselves divided into two
groups, holding separate banquets, one of
which drunk the health of lÂ»uis Bona
parte and sent a message of homage to
ex-Empress Eugenie, while the other was
completely devoted to Victor Napoleon.
La Patrle goes even further, announc
ing: "The powers havp after all two
struggles to sustainâ one open, against
the Chinese; the other, entirely secret
against England. One scarcely knows
which predominates, the duplicity of the
Chinese or the duplicity of England."
This, however, is not alone the source of
resentment against what most Frenchmen
consider their perennial foe â Englandâ for
ofllcial circles credit her, by news dis
patches originating from an English
source, with an effort to belittle the valor
and courage of the French soldiers and
marines in China, accusing them of cow
ardice.
Secret Warfare.
The Figaro, speaking of this, says:
"England in wishing to operate alone, on
the Vangtse seems to desire to return to
the policy of spheres of Influence, thus
tripping at the theory of the 'open door,'
which lately she was defending ardently.
It is even stated that her course cast
suspicion upon the genuineness of Eng
land's attitude regarding the "open door"
policy, for had England been left in pos
session of the port of Shanghai and in
control of the rich resources of the Yang
tze Valley she easily could have been sat
isfied with her position, whether or not
the remainder of the powers secured com*
mercial privileges in the Oriental empire.
'PATUS, Aug. IS.â England's decision not
to land troops In Shanghai when con
vinced that tne other powers would follow
her example la considered here as not

PARIS, Aug. 18.â A second serious acci

occurred, unlike the first when many were
killed or- injured, through the falling of
a foot-bridge, near the celestial globe,
amid a scene of general rejoicing. The
first was on an ordinary Sunday after
noon; the latter upon the occasion of the
most successful fete given, casting a deep
gloom over the city. It had been decided
to give a night fete befitting the day
when the prizes were distributed and con

illuminated. All the Paris Exposition was
crowded, Including the bridges, Joining
one part with the other, and it was one
of these wooden structures â that Joining

the accident happened.

had fallen, but it was found that this was
not absolutely correct, as only the hand

An official of the Carnegie Company,
who furnished this information to a Post
reporter yesterday, was asked why the
two big concerns were willing to permit
the Company to enter the field
which they had monopolized so long. The
reply came that it was simply a question
of policy in order to expedite the letting
of contracts.- It would be better to divide
the contract among three concerns than
to have a long drawn out discussion .as
to who was the lowest bidder hinging on
the' time limit for deliveries and finally
a rejection of all bids and a possible
move to erect a Government armor plate
plant. -â¢Â«Â¦ â¢> ' - Â¦ v â¢ â¢ Â¦ Â¦
When asked if there was any likelihood
of the Midville Company being ths suc
cessful bidder for, all the .: work, the re
ply came that there was no doubt that
Secretary Long was willing to give them
the contract, but that company could not
undertake to deliver the heavy armor in
anything ' like a reasonable time, so It
was -, the best Â¦ plan for all concerned to
make three divisions of the job.
This will be due to an agreement with
the two other companies- in order that
the Midville concern may not again enter
the race as a formidable competitor of
the Carnegie and Bethlehem companies
for the heavy or Krupplzed armor plate.
The Midville Company, in other words,
is to be permitted to secure without op
position the contract for making the
lighter : plates, known as class C and a
portion of class B. This, however, is con
tingent upon the Midville Company being
prepared to reduce the time for the de
livery of the armor contracted for below
twenty-six â¢ months, which was the limit
fixed in that corporation's last bid, and
also for it to be satisfied with less than
20,000 tons as its order. .
This suggestion has been informally
made by the other â¢ companies to their
competitor, and it. is likely the Midville
Company may accept.
PITTSBURG, Aug. 18.â The Post to
morrow will say: The new bids for sup
plying armor plate to the Government
will be opened by the Secretary of the
Navy the first week of October. There
will be three bidders as before, and it
is almost certain that the Midville Steel
Company will receive a .. portion ' of the
work in case the Secretary decides to let
the contract. . - '

be carried on everywhere with vigor and

meet in their respective communities on
Saturday afternoon or evening, Septem

city or precinct Democratic clubs, where
such clubs have not already been organ
ized. The organizations, being Demo
cratic should avoid ostentation and ex
travagance. The fight must be carried on
by American citizens on American prin
ciples and there should be no delay in
pressing club organization.
When organized the secretary should

Chief Hazen was interviewed at his of
fice in the Federal building to-day. He
refused to give the technical charge on
which Maresca and Guido imre detained.
He further said that Maresca is a typical
anarchist. A number of papers In Ital
ian were found on the two men and have
been turned over to the Commissioner.
Captain Howard, supervising inspector of
the contract labor bureau, has charge of
the suspects during the absence of Im
migration Commissioner Fitchie and Dep
uty Commissioner Sweeny. Captain How
ard refused to allow any one to see the
prisoneds. Maresca and Guldo spent
Thursday and Ffiday nights on the Nar
racansett. which is moored off Ellis
Island. Yesterday they were kept in the
detention penitentiary in the barge of
fice
About 10 o'clock Antonio Guido, who
savs he is a brother of, the detained Gui
do*, and who lives in this city, called at
the barge office, accompanied by a law
yer, and asked to see his brother, but
Chief Hazen Silent.
Captain McCluskey of the New York
detective bureau was warned to keep the
matter quiet at all hazards. Detective
Petrosino. who was called in to assist
Hazen on the case, received special or
ders as to secrecy. So very quiet were
all these officers that Assistant Secretary
Taylor of the Treasury Department, who
has full authority in Immigration mat
ters, did not learn of the detention of
the men until to-day. As late as Thurs
day afternoon Immigration Commissioner
Powderly wired ordering that the men be
eecretly held until evidence was for
warded from Washington.
Secretary Taylor said to-day that this
evidence will probably be intimated to
him on his return. These things all indi
cate that the case is deemed of supreme
importance and that the Government is
exerting itself to the uttermost to keep
every move of the detectives and other
agents from becoming known.
NEW YORK. Aug. 18.â It has leaked
out that the administration itself
has undoubtedly been responsible
for the extraordinary pains taken
to keep secret the detention of Mi
chel Guido and Natalie Maresca, sup
posed to be anarchists sent here from
Naples to carry out a plot to assassinate
President McKinley. Chief Hazen, who
arrested the men. was Instructed from
Washington to make no statement to the
newspapers regarding the case. Chief
Wilkie in Washington has gone to the
length of declaring that he never author
ized any statement even to the effect that
the men are anarchists. Immigration
Commissioner Fitchie was especially cau
tioned from Washington to keep news-
I-apers from getting an inkling of the de
tention of the Immigrants.

ISTS ARE SAID TO BE PLOTTING. T
permission was refused until the two de
tained men had been before the Board of
Special Inquiry, which will meet to-day.
Antonio made the following statement:
"My brother, father, mother, sister and
myself all lived at Sorrento, near Naples,
until four months ago. My brother and
I had been soldiers in the Italian navy.
When I came to America four months
ago he was in the navy. I did not expect
him on this boat, although I knew he in
tended following me to America. I do
not believe he ever belonged to any an
archist, socialist, political or secret so
ciety. He was never imprisoned nor ar
rested to my knowledge. We have no
relatives In this country, except an uncle
in this city. I am positive my brother
knows no anarchist in Paterson or New
York."
Guiseppe Costa, supposed to be one of
the anarchists who is detained on the
Narragansett. jumped from that ship last
night and remained in the water until
rriorning. At daybreak, thoroughly ex
hausted, he went ashore on Bedloes Isl
and, and was found naked and: uncon."
scious by a captain of an excursion boat.
Costa said he had come over as a stow
away on the Gallia. He was detained at
the barge office.
Chief Wilkie's Statement.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 18.â Chief "Wilkie
of the secret service emphatically denies
the sensational stories that have been
printed about Natalie Maresca and Michel
Guido and their alleged plot to kill Presi
dent McKinley.
Acqordlng to the Immigration officials
Maresca and Guldo are being held by
the immigration. officers at New York at
the request of Chief Hazen of the secret
service. Immigration officials have no in
formation about the men except that
which came from the secret service men.
Chief Wilkie's statement of this evi
dence Is that on August 2 he received a
cablegram from Naples saying that an
anonymous letter contained information
that Maresca was coming to the United
States to kill the President. This was
followed by another cablegram confirming
the suspicion that the letter had been
written for the purpose of harming Ma
resca,
Chief Wilkle at once instituted an inves
tigation by cable. He was unable to learn
that Maresca was in any way connected
with any anarchist society nor could he
obtain any evidence that he was coming
to the United States with' the intention
of harming the President. He did learn,
however, that llaresca was a former con
vict. As persons who have been con :
victed of crime are not permitted to enter
the United States the immigration officials
were notified and were requested to de
port Maresca.
Guido's case is altogether different.
There is no evidence against him of any
kind whatever, except that he was an
associate of Maresca, but It is probable
that he can be excluded.
The prosecution tried to connect Com
mandant General Botha, with the oTCalr.
Cordua additted that at the suggestion
of Gano he and Gano started out with
the object of visiting Botha, but were
both captured and sent back. The evi
dence, though inconclusive, appeared to
ehow that Cordua had some communica
tion with Botha, although Cordua denied
it. Several witnesses testified that Cor
dua had been drinking hea\"ily of late.

-One of the Jurors said to-night that the
Jurymen were influenced, in making up

dence but that some of the chief points
were Powers' own admission on the stand
that he organized a crowd of 1200 armed
mountaineers, which came .- to Frankfort
Januarv 15; his corroboratlon of parts of
the testimony of Noakes, Golden and Cul

What Influenced the Jury.
There was no Â¦ demonstration following
the verdict, and the crowd filed out of the
courtroom almost in silence. Powers re
mained In the courtroom for some time
after the verdict was rendered in confer
ence with, his attorneys, who will at once
move for a new trial, and failing in that
will take an appeal. .;;:
When the jurymen entered the Jury
room Juror Stone, the oldest one on the
panel was elected foreman. Juror Porter,
the only Republican on the Jury, the first
to speak, said: â _,. .. x
"Gentlemen, I am a Republican, and I
have said that I did not believe that Goe
bel's murder was the result of a conspir
acy I did not think Caleb Powers could
be " guilty,"- but I have heard the evidence
and I am convinced that-he is."
Others also made talks, and It is said
that one of the Jurors thought that the
death penalty ought to be inflicted. How
ever when a ballot was taken all twelve
of them, voted for life imprisonment. The
Jury was composed of eight Democrats,
three anti-Goebel Democrats and one Re-,
publican.
The Jury retired at 1:32 p. m. and re
turned Its verdict at 2:25. being out only
fifty-three minutes. Juror Craig stated
afterward that the verdict could have
been returned even sooner, but considera
ble time was taken up reading the In
structions. Tho vote In favor of a life
sentence was unanimous.
When the jury retired the belief was
general that they would not agree, and In
this opinion the defendant was firmly con
vinced. When the verdict was returned
Powers, for the first time during the
weary six weeks of the trial, betrayed his
feelings. Under all of the trying Incidents
of the trial he had maintained a change
less expression, the same whether things
were going favorably or against him. The
verdict of guilty, however, staggered him
apparently. He was sitting near the door
of the Jury-room, and when the Jury
knocked on the door summoning the Sher
iff his face took on an anxious look that
was noticeable, but did not appear to be
particularly apprehensive. When the
twelve men filed Into the room and took
their seats and the clerk called the roll of
the Jurors the prisoner did not appear to
be .more excited than the- throng of spec
tators,/-who craned their necks to catch
the first Intimation of the verdict.
"Have you made a verdict, gentlemen?"
Inquired the court. KejSSSÂ«flD*J*e
"We have," the Jurors assented, and at
the same time Mr. Stone, the foreman,
passed the verdict up to the clerk, who
read It aloud.
Powers, already pale, grew ghastly as
the verdict was read, and his face betokr
ened great mental anguish. This was only
for a few seconds, however, and then, re
gaining his composure, he turned to the
Misses Dangerfleld, who had been in con
versation with him, and said:
"I was not expecting that. The verdict
Is unjust." A â¢

ADVERTISEMENTS.There is another point at issue. It con
cerns the percentage to be paid to the
wholesale grocers for handling new lines
of goods. The wholesalers ask foÂ» * r per
cent. One line of goods was withdrawn
from thiÂ« market because the manufac
turer refused to pay more laAZt 10 per
cent. The wholesalers have the advantar^>
of agents dealing in several lines at the
â¢ same time. If their terms are nr* com
plied with In all particulars tho whole
salers reftfse to handle all lines represent
ed by an agent for deviation from Instruc
tions in any single lln-\
There is a lot of ugly feeling under the
smiling surface aspect of affairs in tho
wholesale section of the city because of
these business differences. One larg*
house representing several leading lines of
products used by the grocery trade has,
according to current belief â¢ and rumor,
presented the facts to Kastern manufac
turers by a representative who journeyed
East for that particular purpose. The
Associated Wholesale Grocers stand firm
ly by the 13 per cent commission. At pres
ent the principal interest of onlookers la
centered on the fight George H. C. Brad
ford is making against the combine.
The attempt of the Associate! Wholesale
Grocers of this city and Sacramento to
prevent the â¢manufacturers' agents from
dealing directly with retail grocers has
not wholly succeeded. Two leading con
cerns representing manufacturers, namely
Woods. Mailliard & Schmiedell am5 Spohn
& Patrick have succeeded In having the
boycott raised, and have seemingly won
all that they contended for. This wa3 ac
complished as the result of negotiations
at meetings with a committee represent

members ever instituted in the United

as follows:
over all of the Elks marched to the Ar
lington Hotel, where an elaborate ban
quet was given at midnight. The dinner
was strictly Spanish and a tempting oijc.
The menu cards were splendidly got up
in a souvenir form. When the coffee an>i
cigars came Exalted Ruler John G. Mott
of Los Angeles addressed a few appro
priate words of welcome to the brother
hood, to which Exalted Ruler -3. E. Crow
of Santa Barbara responded. John Llew
ellyn of Los Angeles followed with a
song;- Frank G. Flnlayson spoke on the
"Eleven O'clock Toast": Colonel B. F.
Crawshaw of the local lodge made a few
remarks on "Fraternity": J. Rush Bron
son of Los Angeles on "Bohemia," and *..
C. Bennett of Redlands on "Our Baby
Lodge." Dr. J. C. Bainbridgre of the local
lodge chose for his subject "How It Feels
to Be a Baby Elk." His speech was lively
and witty.
After the installation ceremonies were
morning and came up with the Visitors.
At ".Ventura they were met by the recep
tion committee, who escorted the visitors
to this city. On the .train from "Ventura
light refreshments were served.
.- Promptly at 1 o'clock those of the local
lodge who did not compose the reception
committee met at the Fithlan bulldinp,
and headed by Reynolds* band marched
to the Cnapala-street ' railway station,
where they met the Incoming special.
After the visitors had alighted Dr. R. F.
Winchester presented Exalted Ruler John
G. Mott of the Los Angeles lodge -with- a
golden key to the city In behalf of the
city. The key was modeled after a Yale
lock key and was about four feet long. It
had, an appropriate inscription. After the
presentation of the key the Elks to be p.nd
the visiting Elks marched up State street
to the Arlington Hotel, 'then counter
marched to Armory Hall, where the initia
tion ceremonies were to take place. The
march was led by Charles A. Halse Jr..
who acted as grand marshal. Charles
Ealand, Ernest Wickenden. George C.
Sherman and John Bobbins were the aids.
They were all mounted and wore magnln
cdnt purple sashes.
State street had been transformed from
the every-day business street to one
gayly bedecked ln holiday attire. A mag
nificent arch spanned the street about half
way up the line of march* and all tne
stores and buildings were decorated. From
each of tho wires which cross the street
at certain Intervals to suspend the trol
ley wire hung six Chinese lanterns. Over
four hundred lanterns were, used and- the
effect was beautiful. The whole street
was brilliantly Illuminated and large
throngs lined the street to watch the
parade.
On reaching Armory Hall the Elks dis
banded to meet again at 8:30 for the secret
ceremonies.

Special Disratch to The Call
The Results in i Various Counties of
EEPUBLICAN PRIMARIES.
M. Keniston was: elected" chairman of
the convention by a vote of 14S to 48 for
G. \V. Tatterson.
The ballot for county committeeman at
large showed the following strength:
Dr. George 8. Harkness, 156; M. S.
Thresher, 95. Dr. Harkness' re-election to
the chairmanship of the County Central
Committee was the cause of much rejoic
ing in the rank and file cf Republicanism
in this county, while the faction that had
attempted to gain control of the conven
tion was correspondingly depressed.
The convention indorsed tne principles
of the Republican party, formulated at
Philadelphia on June 20, 1000; the national
and State administrations were indorsed
and the nominees were pledged to support
the doctrines of 'the Republican party
formulated in the Philadelphia platform.
The nominees were pledged to secure the
curtailing of public expenses. State, coun
ty and municipal, and the curtailing of all
superfluous State boards and commissions
was demanded. â¢ .
S. D. "Woods - was Indorsed for nomina
tion . for Congressman from the. Second
Congressional District.
! Resolutions were also adopted in favor
of the establishment of a systenrr for: the
storage, of water for the benefit of the
agricultural and j mining industries of the
State. and urging the Senators and Repre
sentatives of California in Congress to use
their best efforts to obtain the improve
ment of the navigable rivers and streams
of the'State. -
Chairman Dr. George S. Harkness of the
County Central Committee was in the
chair and ruled the proxies out. The op
position appealed from the decision, but
the convention sustained the chair by a
vote of 104 to 62.
One big bone of contention In the con
vention to-dny was the election of a
county committeeman at large, which
meant the chairmanship of the RepublL
can County Central Committee. The fight
was practically won in the election of the
chairman of the convention long before,
the nominations for committeemen were
made. Orrln S. Henderson sounded the
slogan by moving that nor proxies bÂ«
voted in the . contest for ' the convention
chairman. >
Assemblyman, to succeed himself, ami W.
S. Reyner for Assemblyman from the
Twenty-sixth District... Supervisors
French and Knight- were renomlnated,
and E. E. Trethaway was nominated for
the Stockton district. Dr. Harkness was
re-elected chairman of the County Com
mittee after a hot fight. Â¦ The convention
Indorsed the candidacy of. Hon. S. D.
Woods of Stockton for Congressman from

fight for re-election, and Supervisor Cottle
retired In .favor of Dr. " Knowles. The
nomination of Walker of Los | Gatos I for
Assemblyman Is an 'extension of * the

member of that organization. : ;
The new County Central Committee Is

Supervisorsâ Second District. Paul P. Austin
(incumbent); Third District, Fred M. Stern
< Incumbent); Fifth District, Dr. L..' Knowles of

The convention recommended that "the
Republicans of Santa Clara Countv â¢ lay
aside all individual or factional differ
ences and discords and . unite ; together
solely for the support of the national Re
publican ticket and for the . ticket put
forth by this convention and In the main

: The following nominations were then
made: ; ..

Assemblymenâ Fifty-fourth District, John S.

It was recommended, that the State con
vention adopt resolutions looking to the
preservation of the forest tract known as
the Big Basin.
Another plank Indorses Ihe j "careful,
practical and economical administration
of Governor Gage."
The administration of the Republican
county officials was also commended. '.*
We further most heartily approve and com
mend the wisdom and statesmanship of tho
Republican administration in the Spanish war
and the suppression of the Philippine insur
rection, and the establishment of law and
order on those islands, and for the prompt
relief afforded to our own and other legations
at Peking, and for the skillful diplomacy with
which the honor and dignity of our nation has
been maintained and advanced among 'the
other nations of the earth during the most
critical period in the history of our republic
since the Civil War.
Indopes the wfse, patriotic and highly euc
cespful administration of President McKlnley,
by which the financial condition of our coun
try has been reestablished upon a sound and
practical basis and its credit bo well established
at home and abroad as to cause its bonds to
find a ready market at a premium which is
at the rate of 2 per cent, which is one-half
tne rate of Interest paid upon the Bale of our
bonds under the previous Democratic admin
istration, and also during? which there has been
adopted and put In operation throughout the
republic a system of protective tariff which

SAX JOSE, Aug. IP.â The Republican
County Convention met at Turn Verein
Hall this morning and in the short space
of two hours completed its work and ad
journed. It was a unanimous affair, the
work having been previously cut out, and
it proved to be the' shortest county con
vention ever held in Santa Clara Counts'.
There was practically no opposition, and
the only ofilce for which two candidates
appeared was for Assemblyman in the
Fifty-fourth District. . John D. Macken
zie, James XV. Rea, Dr. McGraw, Senator
Shortrldge and other prominent party
leaders were present, but the unanimity
of the convention left them nothing to do.
The convention was made up of 152 del
egates. Hon. James R, Lowe was chair
man and Frank H. Benson secretary. Af
ter a short speech by Chairman Lowe
urging united support of McKlnley and
Roosevelt the work was taken up.
The platform in part follows:
All Is Harmong In the Gathering at San Jose, hut There Is

I CHINESE BATTLE I
I WITH A DEVILFISH I
t â¢ X
â¢*â¢ â¢ JL
-r AN' RAFAEL. Aug. 18.â Three Chinamen had a battle with a monster J*
T W devilfish to-day, that attacked the men in their boat, and that they 4*
V I've to tell the tale Is due to their quick and hard fight for life with 4*
jZ hatchets and knives. The octopus must have been of tremendous 4-
â¢ size, for the section of one of his great tentacles which the Chinese *j*
4Â« brought bark as a trophy was fully seven feet long and as thick as a stout X
Â¦j* man's arm at the point of cleavage. . X
T Three sons of the Flowery Kingdom started out this morning, bright and JL
2? early, to gather In the succulent shrimp off California City. They put out 4*
T their nets and then sat down to a bit of gossip anent the latest news from -j*
T the Chinepe war. Then they began to haul in one of the nets. Just as they "f
J. were about to pull the net on boardâ
2 An arm rosÂ« up from out the bosom of the lake. . â¢>
T â¢ â¢ â¢ tnystic, wonderful. 4*
1* *L
y An arm of fleshy hue, waving fantastically and menacingly. Suddenly It de- JL
â¢r st-ended upon and encircled the r.eck of Quongr Wall. " JL
â¢f "Gee Kli! Wha for?" yelled the astonished Quong as his queue burst from 4*
j_ its fastenings. And then there arose a yelling and jabberingâ an outpouring *f
V of sulphurous maledictions In choicest Chinese ever heard in those waters T
T Lre the cry of astonishment and terror had died on Qunog's thin lips there -!-
: arose another swift moving tentacle that gripped the side of the boat. The â¢}â¢
T chinamen, three of them in number, were so territied that they remem- v
â¢ bf-red little of what followed, but the most ferocious attack ever made by~\ 4*
t Prince Tuan on the Icgationers in Peking was a Sunday school picnic com- 4*
â¢ pared to the Favaere onslaught the Chinese lishern* n made on that devilllsn 4-
â¢f With hatchets and knives they went at the monster. The enormous tentacle 4*
Â¦f whirh was fastened to Qunog's neck must have measured over fifteen feet in 4*
â¢j* length, ns tho piece that was chopped ofT was about seven feet long. Jim â¢?â¢
f Ixmg. who wi'-lded the hatchet, said that the monster was killed ln the v
y rattle and sank beneath the waters after they had hacked and slashed at ','â¢
f him for some time. " ~.
â¢r This is the second time that the shrimp fishers have done battle with 4*
â¢j- the devilfish. Large ones rarely make their appearance. Small ones are v
â¢r sometinsc-s found on the beach at low tide. These are considered by the â¢*â¢
â¢?â¢ Chinamen as a great delicacy and a proper dish to give courage and strength â¢*Â¦

MILWAUKEE, Aug. 18.â The Interna
tional Typographical Union to-day recon
sidered the proposition of Delegate Band
low of Cleveland, bearing on politics,
which was adopted yesterday. The meas
ure as reconsidered was killed, the vote
being two-thirds against Its adoption. The
proposition called for the united action of

nate unions should adopt conciliatory measures
at &!1 ltrr.es when changing their sc&la of
prices, and that before any change In scale
of prices is adopted, it should be submitted

' From this incomplete list of the Californian win
ners of gold medals and grand prizes we may derive
good reasons for believing. that when the full list. is
published we shall have cause to be well pleased with
the record our State has made for itself in the great
competition at Paris. It is to be noted here also that
among the foreigners who have been decoratedvwith
the insignia. of the Legion of Honor by the Presi
dent of the" French republic in recognition of their
service at the exposition is M. H. de Young. That of
course counts as another honor, designed for the
State,, and is an evidence of the favorable impression
that California has made upon the exposition authori
ties' by the display of industrial energy and skill and
enterprise. BBBSmSBSnI
Notwithstanding, the handicap that was put upon
the wines of the State by the arbitrary ruling of the
judges concerning the labels of some of them, we
carry off quite a number of the grand prizes and gold
medals in that department' The reported list gives
the names of the California "Wine, Association, San
Luis Vineyard and the Sierra Madre Vintage Com
pany. In other departments the lists include the
names of such noted California industries as the. New
Almaden Mining Company, (California Packers' Com
pany, California CannersV Company,, Pacific, Cream
eries, Standard Electric Company, George Fuller
Company of San Francisco and the Alaska Packers'
Association. r 'Â¦'"â¢Â¦:
Among the exhibitors to whom have been awarded
grand prizes or gold medals the California Commis
sion "figures prominently. It is named in the list of
winners in the department of civil engineering and
transportation, in the department of mining and
metallurgy, in the department of agriculture, while
in the department of forestry and fisheries it is twice
named. Of the State boards and commissions that
receive honors California is represented by the Board
of Agriculture, the Mining Bureau, __the Board of
Health, the State also gets honors for Public
Charities and Corrections. The University of Cali
fornia is named among the winners in the depart
ment of higher education, and Stanford University in
the department of forest and fisheries.
PRELIMINARY reports thus far telegraphed of
the awards of prizes and honors among the ex
hibitors at the Paris Exposition are too incom
plete to show what will be the full measure of Cali
fornia's share in them. Only the list of grand prizes
and gold medals has been given out at all, and even
that comes in a form so condensed that in. many
points it is not clear. Enough, however, is revealed
to make it certain that when all the awards are pub
lished in detail California will stand high among the
States of the Union and take a foremost place in the
list of the prize-winners.
HONORS FOR CALJFORNIANS.
In the end machinery will, of course, triumph in
China as it has triumphed elsewhere; but in the chang
ing of the old order to the new we must expect con
tinual disturbances and: civil strife in the ; empire.
European officials take; an optimistic ; view of the situ-:
ation and predict that, when the "Boxer insurrection
has been suppressed the foreign trade, will ; increase
even more rapidly than it has in the last decade. That
means, there is to be in.China such a ', market for! for
eign goods as has never been in the world, and
it is because of that belief the commercial nations are
now so eagerly urging "on the invasion and .at 1 the
same time watching one another so jealously. In fact,
it is quite nn the cards that ithh same foreign trade
which has led to civil- war "in China may. yet lead to
When the foreign trade of a people increases more
than 100 per cent in less than ten years it is evident
a serious disturbance has taken place in the estab
lished order of industry and commerce. Many people
have - profited by the . new trade, and doubtless the
community as a whole has benefited by it; but, on
the other hand, many persons-have been injured by
the foreign competition, and naturally, they are in
clined to make desperate efforts to prevent an exten
sion of it. Â¦ [ _ :
In this view of the case the Boxer revolt is not
widely different from the disturbances caused: in Eu
rope and in this country by the introduction of labor
saving machinery. The disturbance in'China is greater
than that experienced in any civilized nation partly
because more people in China have been affected by
the new form of industry, and partly because the Gov
ernment has to some extent least sympathized with
the reactionary movement and encouraged it.
The theory is not lacking in evidence to confirm it.
The development of Chinese trade has been indeed
remarkable. Statistics recently published by the
Chinese Imperial Maritime Customs show the fol
lowing facts: "In 1890 the value of the net imports
from foreign countries into China was 127,093,481
Haikwan taels, and of the exports from China" to for
eign countries 87,144,480 Haikwan taels, a total of
214,237,961. Haikwan taels. There has been a steady
and continuous increase since 1890. In 1899 the net
iinports were valued at 264,748,456 Haikwan taels, and
the exports at 195,843 Haikwan taels, a total of 460,
533,288, or considerably more than twice as much
as in 1890."
To these various suggestions there is now added
another. A correspondent of the New York Com
mercial attributes the disturbance to purely commer
cial causes. He says: "The movement is clearly the
work of wire-pullers in high places who are alarmed
at the rapid growth of external commerce and the
people's eagerness to adopt the industrial mechanism
and appliances of the west." Chinese foreign trade
has expanded enormously as a result of the railway
construction in the empire, and as new concessions
had been obtained for further railroads, the conserva
tive industrial element of the empire saw that if they
were to preserve the old order of things the time had
come to strike and strike hard.
JV/l ANY explanations have been given of the re
/ \ volt in China. To the missionary it appears
* an outbreak of. superstition . and . paganism.
against the true religion; the statesman sees in it an
outburst of defiance on the part of barbarism against
civilization; while there are not lacking philosophers
who perceive in the Boxer an illustration of the vio
lence which ' "degenerates" can commit when once
they are permitted to gain headway.
CHINA'S FOREIGN TR0DE.
This outgoing class, faced toward fortune hoped
for, is the drain upon us. Turning to immigration as
a source of supply of population, it will be seen that
our geographical position serves to make selection for
us that is most desirable. As it was in the beginning,
so is it now and will be, world ' without end. The
European immigration and that from the Eastern
States is picked and selected by distance. We get the
best, therefore we do not get as many as deploy upon
fields that are nearer to their point of departure. We
get the best in quality and therefore the least in" quan
tity.
When these considerations are taken into the calcu
lation, it will be seen that San Francisco has no
cause to be downcast because of the showing of the
census. She remains the financial and commercial
center of all this west coast, from Point Barrow to
Cape Horn, and none will arise in the future to dis
turb her primacy. ,
AH these really belong to us. They had no other
permanent abiding place. When their errand abroad
is finished the survivors return to ua. When they
speak of home in their exile they mean San Fran
cisco, and this city is their boast and toast. .
People here have a continent behind them and an
ocean in front, each presenting every incentive to
stimulate the independence and self-reliance that are
the leading qualities of the far Western character.
They go forth to the conquest of fortune, and when it
is ms.de the victors return to us with the wealth that
has rewarded their genius and courage. Of course all
do not come back as conquerors, and many fall, but
it has always been bo and will always be. This
process of 6wanning to far fields of human activity
and returning; with the legitimate Bpoils of industry
and thrift accounts for our excess of wealth when
measured in proportion to our population. Here the
rich and the well-to-do abound, because our sons that
have gone afar for fortune carry the shining memory
of the parent city with them, and when the fickle god
dess of gain has smiled upon them there is no other
part of the earth that excels this in attracting them.
So they come, as the lover to his lady, to find eve-y
well remembered charm enhanced and heightened by
time. and. here they rest in the enjoyment of their
competency.
It is safe to eay that when the census was taken
San Francisco had 20,000 absentees in the gold re
gions of Alaska, and a quarter as many more on the
eame quest in Mexico and South America. At least
10,000 others are in Australia, Japan, China, and seek
injj profit and adventure in far Siberia.
This city is the parent hive of the Pacific Coast Its
increase swarms away to every field of adventure and
enterprise. Whatever is attractive to the business in
stinct, from the South Sea Islands to the Polar
Circle, draws more upon our population than upon'
any other city.
THE low percentage of incr**ase in the population
of San Francisco has been commented oa.
While there is no doubt oi the fairness of the
census, it may be said truthfully that it does not
taily all that San Francisco is entitled to, and this is
no fault of the enumerators.
SAN FRANCISCO'S CENSUS.
On the 5th of June, 1860, in reply to
some strictures upon lack of ' design in
Mme. Defarge's death, he wrote to Bul
wer Lytton: "I am not clear and I never
have been clear respecting that canon of
fiction which forbids the interposition of
accident in such a case as Mme. De
farge's death. "Where the accident is in
separable from the passion and emotion
of the character, when it is strictly con
sistent with the whole design and arises
out of seme culminating proceeding on the
part of the character â¢which the whole
story has led up to, it seems to me to
become, as It were, an act of divine jus
tice. And when I use Miss Pross (though
In November, 1859, Dickens gave Mme.
Celeste permission to have a. dramatiza
tion made for the Lyceum Theater. Thi3
was accordingly done by Henry J. Riv
ers, Mme. Celeste appearing as Mme. De
farge. The same year another version was
made by Dickens' friend, Tom Taylor, and
produced at the Lyceum Theater In Jan
uary, 1S60. Dickens himself superintended
the rehearsals. "'Â«-<l* â¢
In October, 1859, he sent the proofsheets
of the entire novel to his friend Regnier
of the Comedie Francalse. "I want you
to read it," he says, "for two reasons.
Firstly, because I hope it is the best story
I have written. Secondly, because It
treats of a very remarkable time in
France; and I should very much like to
know what you think of its being drama
tized for a French theater. If you should
think it likely to be done, I should be glad
to take some steps toward having it well
done. The story is an extraordinary suc
cess here, and I think the end of it is cer
tain to make a still greater sensation."
Regnier replied that the representation
would probably be prohibited (this was
under the third Napoleon, "a saint on
earth, an angel in heaven," as he was
onco characterized ftfr me by a lady who
knew him). So the French stage lost a
fine melodrama and Regnier the chance
of his life in not being able to play Syd
ney Carton.
The outline of the* character and ad
ventures of Dr. Manette seems to have
occurred to him as early as' 1S46, when he
writes to Forster: "I have been thinking
this last day or two that good Christmas
characters might be ground out of the
idea of a man imprisoned for ten or fif
teen years, his imprisonment being the
gap between the people and the circum
stances of the first part and the altered
people and circumstances of the second,
and his own changed mind." Nothing
came of this, however, for many years.
"David Copperfield," "Bleak House" and
"Little Dorrit" were all written before
he really got to work on "A Tale of Two
Cities," in 1S58. We then find this Jotting
in. his memorandum book: "How as to a
story In two periodsâ with a lapse of time
between, like a French drama? Titles for
such a notion. Time! The Leaves of the
Forest. Scattered Leaves. Great
Wheel. Round and Round. Old Leaves.
Long Ago. Far Apart. Fallen Leaves,
i-^ve and Twenty Years. Years and Years.
Rolling Years. Day after Day. Felled
Trees. Memory Carton. Rolling Stones.
Two Generations." By August, 1859, he
had made good progress Â¦with the story,
the construction of which was giving him
immense labor. "Nothing but the inter
est of the subject," he writes, "and the
pleasure of striving with the difficulty of
the forms of treatment, nothing in the
mere way of money, I mean, could also
repay the time and trouble of the inces
sant condensation. But I set myself the
little task of making a picturesque story,
rising in every chapter with characters
true to nature, but whom the story Itself
should express, more than they should
express themselves, by dialogue." Here
consciously or unconsciously he has laid
down a principle of dramatic construc
tion true for all time.

Arrangements have been made with the Philadel
phia Commercial Museum whereby the museum on
this coast will have duplicates of all samples and the
benefit of all information now in the possession of
the older institution, and in future there will be an
interchange of all information,, the subscriber to the
one having the advantages of both. With such as
surances of benefit there, should be no further delay,
among our merchants, manufacturers and progressive
citizens generally. Sign the rolls now and have the
honor of being a charter, member of the Pacific Coast
Commercial Museum. â¢ .
5. To act as a general commercial agency; that is,
to furnish reliable information of the, financial stand
ing of foreign business houses in any part of the world
and the right people in any line of business to cor
respond with.
6. To furnish special information or reports of any
nature that may be desired-
4. To find out what raw or manufactured products
of other countries can be used here; to submit sam
ples and expert reports, on same.
3. To collect and exhibit samples from countries we
desire to do business with of all goods that are at
present supplied by countries in competition with us.
2. To tell the manufacturer or merchant accurately
in detail and up to date the conditions of the markets
he proposes to enter, what wares he has to compete
with and whom to address.
Of the benefits to.be deriveel from the museum it
can hardly be worth while to refer at any length. The
enterprise is' not to be a speculative venture. The
success achieved by the Commercial Museum in
Philadelphia attests the demand which exists in the
United States for -such an institution. It is doubtful
if any other commercial enterprise of the last ten
years has been so beneficial to the country or so amply
fulfilled the expectations of its promoters. Now the
museum in this city is to be in alliance with the great
institution in Philadelphia. It will therefore start
under the best auspices and have a potent help from
the start in everything it undertakes for the general
good.
Among the purposes for which the Pacific museum
is devised are these:
1. To increase the foreign commerce of the entire
Pacific Coast.
The establishment of the museum being now as
sured, it will be well for all merchants, manufacturers
and others interested in commerce and industry to
take note of the rule of the association that all mem
bers joining before the opening of the museum shall
pay an initiation fee of $60, but that after the mu
seum opens the initiation fee-shall be fixed at $150.
The rule is a just one, for it is only fair that those who
take the risks and do the work of-launching the en
terprise shall have the advantage of obtaining mem
bership at a lower cost than those, who hold backl' At
the same time, in order to give all an opportunity of
profiting by that the circular letter has
been issued' directing public attention to the rule and
to the fact that the museum is soon to be established.
GRATIFYING to every progressive citizen of
the Pacific Coast is the announcement made in
a circular letter of .the executive committee of
the Pacific Commercial Museum, that the committee
has completed its work, that about 180 members have
signed the roll, assuring the institution a sufficient in
come to place it in active operation at once, and that
a report to that effect will be made to the promotion'
committee.

other wars in Europe. Wolves that run together in
harmony to capture a prey, have been known to fight
over it very fiercely after it was dragged down. -
It is rather remarkable that he did not come to the
front sooner as an anti-expansionist, when his voice
and influence might have assisted in shaping public
opinion. The South, which will give Bryan about all
the electoral votes he will get, is almost unanimous
in favor of holding the Philippines, and has done
much to shape opinion in that direction, through the
influence of Morgan, McEnery, McLaurin and other
public leaders of that section. If. Mr. Cockran is 30
very sensitive on the subject he should have gone
down there and contested with those supporters of
Bryan for the control of Southern opinion.
In 1892 he was the pet of Tammany. In 1896
Croker had outlawed him and lifted him out of his
seat in Congress. He desires to re-enter public life
and is back in Tammany again, and perhaps on the
road to the United States Senate, if the New York
Legislature can be carried.
He is not noted for the soundness of his political
judgment He opposed Mr/ Cleveland continually.
In 1892 he spoke for nearly three hours in the Demor
cratic National Convention against Cleveland, making
an oration of great power and fire, in which over and
over again he declared the impossibility of Cleveland's
election. But he was nominated and elected. It is
true that in 1896 Cockran supported McKinley di
rectly, but he did- not declare himself until after the
gold Democratic movement had been started without
his assistance.
If Mr. Cockran had said that the Republican plat
form is tentative, while the Democratic platform iden
tifies anti-expansion with secession, he would have ut
tcred an exact truth that would have been creditable
to him.
That is settled to the satisfaction of Mr. Cockran.
But what warrant has he for saying that President
McKinley supports imperialism of any kind? There
is no justification for the charge. If he mean, instead
of imperialism, the holding of the Philippines, we as
sert that Colonel Bryan will receive the votes of more
â¢men who favor that than McKinley will. The Re
publican platform by no means concludes that ques
tion, but leaves the Republican party free to respond
to a reaction of public sentiment that is likely to oc
cur. The Democratic platform juggles with it by de
claring that the constitution follows the flag, and de
manding that the flag be withdrawn from the Philip
pines. It will be observed that this is an admission
that the flag is in the Philippines, therefore the con
stitution must be there, and to withdraw it will be
effecting just what the secessionists claimed in 1861.
He says: "The issue of imperialism having been
squarely raised between the two great parties, it must
be plain that the only way in s'hich a citizen can
exercise any direct influence upon the result is by
voting for the Republican candidate, who supports,
or the Democratic candidate, who opposes it."
This same card is being played again, and some
well meaning people are being led astray by it. Mr.
Bourke Cockran, in his letter to the Liberty meeting
in Indianapolis, presents a fine example of the poli
tician who states his opponent's position by * mis
stating it and then proceeds to attack his own mis
statement.
During the. Civil War every major move made by
Lincoln to put down rebellion and save the Union
was denounced as having morArchy and empire for
its object The same charge was made against Grant,
and fellows of the Bryan stripe went about pretending
to mourn for, the liberty lost forever to the people.
IT is worth remembering that a favorite Demo
ciatic campaign accusation against Republicans
has always been that they are imperialists.

also wanted Constable Viscus to arrest
him. The Constable told him that that
could not be done unless he had commit
ted some crime. Vierra went away very
much excited and seemed to be In fear
of his life.

death was not due- to drowning. Matters
quieted down after the inquest until a
fchort time ago, when many of the Portu

! Â«aji to think that there were rood reasons
i tor believing that Mrs. Vierra s death was
i nut due to accident or suicide, but that
i she had been murdered. The more they
; discussed the matter among themselves
the more convinced they oecame that
Antone Vitrra had murdered his wife;
; that he had choked her to death in their
I house and then threw the body into the
I river. Now rhe husband, at whom the
' finger of suspicion is pointed, fears that

i that it should be determined from the
i evidence thtv had gathered whether or
Â¦ not Antone Vierra murdered his wife, and

If any. Mrs. Joaquin Vierra had in the
' tragedy. The other two persons involved

Philip Koenigberger, Tobacco Dealer
S From New York, Kills Himself
in Barber-Shop.
Philip Koenigberger died at the French
Hospital yesterday morning from the ef
fects of razor wounds Inflicted by himself
last Wednesday."
Koenigberger was a tobacco dealer and
resided in New York. He went to the
hospital several weeks ago for treatment.
He developed symptoms of insanity, and
for, that reason he was provided with an
attendant. Wednesday morning Koenig
berger and the attendant went out for a
walk and entered a barber shop, and
while * tho attendant's back was turned
Koenigberger picked up a razor and
slashed: his throat with it. The barber
and the attendant seized and overpow
ered the insane man and took away the
razor. - Then they brought him to the
hospital, where Dr. Tait dressed the
wound. - \-Zi- 'Â¦Â¦-.''Â¦
Koenigberger was E4 j-ears old and a
native of Germany. His wife and daugh
ter are at present traveling in Europe,
and a son is In Dead wood.. S.-D. Up to a
few months ago -he had been a member
of t the. firm -of Schwartz & Co.," tobacco
dealers in New York, but sold out shortly
before he came to * California.
Tho hospital ; authorities and Coroner
Colo had. a clash' yesterday morning Dr 1
Tait . contending that Koenlgberger dRed
of pneumonia, for which he had been un
der : treatment for the past v forty-four
days. The Coroner Insisted that his duty
required him to hold an inauest. The
Coroner," Autopsy Surgeon Leland and a
jury went to^the ; French Hospital yes
terday i to view, the body," after which , Dr.
Leland performed 'Â¦ the .autopsy Â¦ to ascer
tain whether -' pneumonia' or the razor
wounds -were the cause of. death.

available, and that was located several
blocks distant. Finally an engine was
placed over one of the wharfs and a sin
gle stream thrown onthe flames. - ' '
The fire gained rapid headway and soon
the entire structures was wrapped in
flames. The new steamer Santa Barbara
lay. to -the east, between the burning
structure and the main buildings of the
iron works. A strong south wind that
was blowing gTeatly assisted the lire
fighters in confining the flames to the
planing mills. The elements of destruc
tion soon spread to the flsh packing es^
tablishment, which is in the same build
ing, and in less than one hour nothing re
mained but glowing coals and a heap of
twisted iron. The tugboat, which was be
ing constructed in the planing mills, was
so badly charred that it will have, to be
completely rebuilt.
The structure .burned was a frame (af
fair, two stories in height, nearly 100 feet
long and fifty feet wide. The estimated
loss is divided as follows: Twenty-five
thousand dollars on the planing mills,
$2000 on the fish packing company and the
remainder on the boats. Insurance poli
cies cover the entire amount.,
A number of soldiers rushed from the
Presidio when the alarm was turned in
and offered their services In Â¦ extinguish
ing: the fire. One of them was severely
burned on the hand. Two spectators were
cut about -the head by falling debris, but
their injuries were only superficial.

The San Pablo will be the finest ferry
boat on the bay. It is expected that she
will be completed in sixty days and put
on the run between Point Richmond and
San Francisco. The vessel has a length
of 225 feet, 04 feet beam and 17.6 feet
depth. Her horsepower Is 2000 and speed I
fifteen knots. Her keel was laid May 15.
Feathering paddle-wheels are the nov
elty in the construction of the San Pablo.
They are so built as to feather in either
direction, as the San Pablo is intended to
run either end tirst. The wheels are very
small, permitting gTeater deck room above
for the accommodation of passengers.
* Work will at once begin In the con
structing shed made vacant by the launch
of the San Pablo on tho freight steamer

Hawaiian Steamship- Company, which isÂ»
to be 4S9 feet in length.

British Steamer Argyll Is
Bought by James Jerpme
Â¦ for Coast Trade.
Will Make Trip to Manila" for Uncle
Sam and Will Enter Lists
- Â¦ . *â¢*:Â¦ 'tv* as an American
""'Vessel.
The British steamer Argyll has been
purchased by Janes Jerome and will be
added to his line of coasting colliers after
her next voyage to Manila for the United
States Government. When Bhe comes to
San Francisco the Argyll will fly the
stars and stripes, as under an arrange'
ment with Uncle Sam the old owners
had a claim upon an American registry.
When the United States wanted ships
to carry her aoldiers to the Philippines
Dodwell & Co. of Hongkong and Portland
came to the . assistance of the Govern
ment with the British steamers Victoria,
Tacoma, Olympla and Columbia.- Tho rate
was. reasonable, but' there was a string 1
attached to It- Oodwell & Co. wera to ba
given an American registry for five
steamers. They at oneÂ© placed the Vic
toria, Tacoma, Olympia and Columbia
under the stars and stripes. Since then
the Columbia has been purchased by the.
Government and is known as the Rose
crans.
The listing of these four vessels left
Dodwell & Co. "with a. vacancy for an
other British ship to be placed under the
American flag. The Argyll was pur
chased from J. Warrack *s Co. of Liver
pool, England, and was then chartered
to the Government for one trip to Ma
nila. Since then she has been sold to
James Jerome and will run in the coal
trade between here and Puget Sound.
Ths Argyll Is 18S6 tons net burden, or
nearly 600 'tons larger than Jerome's
steamer Progreso. She was built In 1S92
by W. Gray & Co. (Limited) at West Har
telpool, England, and is 320 feet 2 Inches
long, 40 feet 7 Inches beam and 24 feet 4
Inches deep. â¢
Steamer for Vallejo Trade.
Hatch Bros, are building a new steamer
for the Vallejo trade. She will be on
the model of the Monticello, but larger
and faster. When completed it is expect
ed that she will make at least eighteen
knots, and will bo one of the fastest boats
on the bay. The new boat is being built
at Belllngham Bay, and will be ready
for service by the first of the year. With
her Captain Hatch says he can make
railroad time, and will give the Southern
Pacific a hard run for the entire trade
of Vallejo and Maro Island. The new
boat and the Monticello are expected to
make six trips a day, which will be at
least three trips more than is made by
the railroad.
A Gallant Rescue.
Had It not been for the prompt action
of Henry Peterson a lad named John
Jackson, who lives on San Jose avenue,
would have lost his life yesterday. Jack
son with three other lads had come down
to the Potrero to see the launching of the
Santa Fe steamer San Pablo. To be
guile tho time they went out fishing In
a flat-bottomed boat and finally got on
some boom-logs moored In the basin by
the Union Iron Works. Young Jackson
got on one of these logs and making a
mlssstep fell into the bay. He was go
ing down for the last time when Peter
son happened along in his launch DelL
Without* an instant's hesitation the gal
lant launch owner jumped in with all his
clothes on and held the boy up until the
Dell could be put about, when both were
got aboard. Young Jackson was sent
ashore in the skiff, while Peterson hurried
back to Folsom street in the launch and
then went home to change his clothes as
though nothing had happened.
"Water Front Notes.
The battle-ship "Iowa was moved down
to an anchorage off the Union Iron Works
yesterday, where she will be coaled. On
Tuesday she goes to Monterey, so to
day will be the last occasion on which
the battle-ship can be visited for several
weeks to come. Launches will run from
the Folsom-street float as usual. .
Among those who will sail on the trans
port Sherman on Monday will be a chief
and first assistant, engineers and a num
ber of other employes for the engine
room 'of the hospital ship Relief. The men
on the Relief have been a long time away
from home and they want to get back.

Station.
Peter Mathison, an old man living at
S10*. Minna street, called at the Southern
police station about 7 o'clock yesterday
morning with his face and head cut and
bleeding. He said a man who lived in- the
flat above him had come up behind him
in the yard and struck him on the back
of the head with a bottle, knocking him
down. His assailant then jumped on him
and continued to strike him with his flats
on the face and head. Mathlson nsked
Policeman Xolting. who was on station
duty, if he could carry a revolver for self
protection. Xolting toM him he could not
do so without a permit, and took him to
the Receiving Hospital, where his wounds
were dressed. -
About 10 o'clock Mathison again called
at the police station. He had an ax In his
hand, and said as the man had threatened
to kill him and he could not carry a re
volver he had armed hlmpelf with the
ax. He was induced to leave the ax at the
station and was taken to the warrant
clerk's office, where he obtained a "John
Doo" warrant for his assailant's arrest
on the charge of battery, sworn to before
Judge Mogan. Mathlson's assailant ac
cused him of killing one of his dogs.
DETERMINED TO DEFEND
HIMSELF WITH AN AX
The Building Trades Council held a spe
cial meeting last evening and reviewed
tho situation growing out of the trouble
between the planing mill owners and op
eratives. No action was taken in regard
to precipitating a general strike in the
building trades, for the reason that it was
the unanimous sentiment that the millmen
had made encouraging gains during tha
past week and that with nine factories
running on eight-hour time in competition
with the nine-hour mills It was only a
question of time when the mill-owners
would have to swing Into line or close
their shops.
The plan now is to push the eight-hour
mills !to* their utmost capacity. The num
ber of hands will be increased as, the busi
ness increases, "-and plans were discussed
last evening for working these shops with
two and three, shifts every twenty-four
hours, which /would mean the -, running of
the mills day and night. Statements hav
ing been made by the Mill-owners' Asso
ciation that the eight-hour mills were
manned principally by the owners them
selves; President â¢ McCarthy gave out a
table last evening showing the actual
working force In these mills, as follows: ;

Some of the mlllmen were made ..very

that Mahoney : Brothers, contractors, had
accepted a load of lumber; from a nine
hour, mill" and were t putting the stuff into
a new â¢ house , at . the â¢ corner- of ' Broadway

tion of California deplore tho strike
and differences between the owners of

Declares Eight-Hour Mills
Are Employing at Least
147 Men
McCARTHY SAYS
WILKIE'S TOTALS
ARE INCORRECT
having accepted the eight-hour schedule.
McCarthy Replies to Wilkie.
President McCarthy, speaking for the
Millmen's Union and the Building Trades
Council, smiled when he waa shown An
drew Wilkle's statement published in yes
terday's Call.
"In reply to the interview with Mr. Wil
kie, wherein he states that certain state
ments made by me are erroneous and mis
leading," said Mr. McCarthy. "I desire to
say that' everything said and done by the
Building Trades Council through this en
tire affair has been on the strictest lines
of sincerity and truth. This, however,
cannot be said of Mr. Wilkle's interview,
wherein he states that the mills now run
ning eight hours are only working, as he
puts it, 'the boss or employing force, with
just a few other men'â eleven. I believe,
is the number mentioned by Mr. Wilkie.
"I desire to reiterate the former state
ments given to the press by the Bunding
Trades Council, namely, that the total
number being, employed by the nine mills
which are now running on eight-hour timo
is 147, excluding the bosses, and, further
more, since these nine mills have begun
to run eight hours the working force has.
by reason of the large amout of work
coming to them through adopting the
eight-hour day, been increased from 35 to
40 per cent and many of them are now
contemplating enlarging their plants and
running two eight-hour shifts in twenty
four. It thus follows that if Mr. Wilkie
and his copartners continue to opp.ose the
just requests of the men the above men
tioned firms, with many new acquisitions,
will of necessity be compelled to run three
instead of two shifts; in other words, they
will run three eight-hour shifts in twenty
four hours. .
"With reference to that passage dealing
with outside organizations permit me to
say that Mr. Wilkie, Mr. Crocker and Mr.
Moore have Â¦ endeavored long ere "this to
isolate the millmen from all the other
trades to the end that they would have to
fight their battle alone. This the millmen
refused to accede to. hence Mr. Wilkie's
wrath. With reference to the number who
are so anxious to go back it might be well
toBtate that if they were so desirous of
working nine hours, as Mr. Wilkie states,
they would have held their positions at
thetlme when Mr. Wilkie and every other
member of the so-called combine were of
fering fabulous sums in order to induce
the men to remain at work."
Machinery Crippled.
The : first complaint of any destructive
act against employers on the- part of
striking millmen is made by James
Young, who owns a mill on the corner of
Mission and Beale streets. Mr. Young
lays at the hands of the strikers an out
rageous attempt to cripple his machinery.
The attempt,: by whoever it was made,
,,was largely successful and inflicted se
rious damage. . ' , .' .' , '
Mr. Young shut his mill down- Mon
day/ last, but on" Friday had to re-
sume work In order to finish some mill
work for the Pacific;Mall Steamship Com
pany.' He Is a practical mlllhand and
with the help of his bookkeeper had suc
ceeded in partly finishing the work before
night.- Saturday morning , he found, his
sticker and planers running "out of true
and examination proved that some mis
creant had filled the oil cupa of the ma
chines-with fine - emery = powder, which
had ground- into, the shafts and bearings,
rendering the machines utterly useless for
any work requiring an accurate finish:
To put the machines in a proper state bf
repair will require the expenditure of sev
eral hundred dollars. Â¦. ... -.," Â¦. j-.
Mr/. Young Is at a loss for a reason for
the cowardly trick, as he has Â« been al
ways on the most friendly terms with his
men, some of whom have been in his em
ploy for ten and twelve years, c'.
"None of my men 1 ; would do. such a
thing,", said Mr. Young' yesterday, "but
there is always a crowd connected .with
such, strikes , that; are fit for such mean,
contemptible tricks and for nothing else.
They must have entered the place through
a space i under the sidewalk. It la- very.
evident they are millhands, for any one
unacquainted. with the machines would not

Reviews the Enormity of thÂ© Guilty
Man's Crime' and Condemns
Him to 35 Years at
San Quentin. -
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDWOOD CITT7~Aug. 18.â John Fitz
gerald, the murderer of John Lennon, waa
sentenced to-day by Judge W. P. Lawlor
of San Francisco to thlrty-flve years' im
prisonment at San Quentin. This virtu
ally means that Fitzgerald will spend the
balance of his days behind the bars, as
he is now about 50 years of age.
In passing; sentence Judge Lawlor re
viewed to considerable extent the evidence
as produced at the trial, and commented
upon the defense set up by Fitzgerald.
He also complimented the District At
torney and the Sheriff upon the manner
in which they conducted the prosecution
and investigated the crime.
Before sentence was passed upon the
prisoner, his attorney, L. P. Boardman,
made the usual motion for a new trial,
which 'was denied by the court.
.One of the grounds of the motion was
alleged misconduct upon the part of Juror
Horace Wilson, who, it was alleged by
Fitzgerald in an affidavit, during the
course of the trial, in company with two
other men, Â¦ visited the County Jail for
the purpose of examining the place and
obtaining evidence out of court.
Fitzgerald testified that while a pris
oner in the jail he was thrown into a
filthy and vermin-Infected place and com
pelled to associate with criminals and the
scum of society, and in his affidavit
charges that Nelson visited the place for '
the purpose of negativing the evidence of
defendant.
Mr. Nelson in an affidavit admitted the
visit, as stated, but alleged that he was
Invited to do so by a person who was a
stranger to him and to tho county, and
that he went out of curiosity; that he
talked with no one about the case, and
that the visit did not influence his ver
dict in any manner.
Before passing sentence Judge Lawlor
stated that In his opinion the killing of
Lennon by Fitzgerald was a cold-blooded
murder and he was only surprised that
the jury did not bring in a verdict of
murder in the first degree instead of the
second degree. He said he did not believe
the defendant's version of the shooting,
but thought while upon the witness stand
Fitzgerald deliberately lied and committed
perjury in addition to the crime of mur
der. He was satisfied from all the cir
circumstances in the case that defendant
had formed the intention of murdering
Lennon and had been waiting for just
such an opportunity as presented itself
on Christmas eve of last year. He
spoke of Fitzgerald as an outcast from
society, a man without a home, shunned
bv all except Lennon, who was his best
friend and who. when every one had turned
against Fitzgerald, took him into his homo
and sheltered and fed him and waa his
benefactor.
At the time of passing sentence the
courtroom was full of people.
Fitzgerald and Lennon had been living
together for some months previous to De
cember of last year at the latter's house,
near Holy Cross Cemetery, in the north
end of San Mateo County. Lennon was a
teamster and contractor and Fitzgerald
was living with him. These two men and
a boy by the name of O'Malley were the
only occupants of the house.
On Sunaay, the 24th day of December
of last year, Fitzgerald went to San
Francisco. He took the early train at
Holy Cross, being accompanied to the
train by O'Malley. He had quarreled with
Lennon the night previous and on the
way to the train said to O'Malley: "If
I put a bullet through that nothing
would be done to me."
Fitzgerald returned to the Lennon
house the same evening and found Len
non there alone. Words passed between
the men and Fitzcerald says Lennon
struck him and knocked him â¢ down and
beat him. He got up and attempted to
get away. Near the door he picked up
a rifle. Lennon came at him again and
he* struck him with the rifle. Lennon
grabbed the rifle and it waa accidentally
discharged, the bullet piercing Lennon's
breast.
. The jury placed no credence in his story
of self-defense and accident, neither did
the Judge. *
An appeal will be taken to the' Supreme
Court and a stay of execution has been
granted for four weeks.

MARKHAM REPLIES
TO HUNTINGTON
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 19, 1900.
OAKLAND, Aug. 13.â Several stone ma
sons, assisted by a derrickman and en
gineer, resumed work on the De Fremery
building at 1 o'clock this afternoon, but
three-quarters of an hour later J. H. Mul
len, business agent of the Building Trades
Council, called the men off.
"The men went to work under a misun
derstanding," said J. Pratt of the Build
ing Trades Council. "They thought that
permission had been granted by President
McCarthy of the San Francisco Building
Trades' Council, with whom the masons
are affiliated. It was said that the archi
tect of- the building had promised that no
unfair timber should be used In the.con
struction and that the stonemasons might
therefore lay the remaining twenty-one
stones in order that the derrick and en
gine might be removed from the street.
"No knowledge of such an arrangement
has come to the local Trades Council,
and so Mr. Mullen refused to let the work
go oÂ»."
A rumor was circulated this afternoon
that when the men at Burnham & Stande
ford's mill stopped work at lunch time
they were pelted with bricks by a crowd
of 'men on the corner of Washington and
Second streets. The members of the Mill
Workers* Union Indignantly deny that any
disturbance occurred. They declare that
protect the local mills from out-of-town
competition.
The Union Lumber Company at the foot
of Sixth street has ten men put of four
teen at work and is rushed with business.
As only about 10 per cent of the com
pany's business is done in this city the
threats of the union to have its goods
boycotted do not cause the concern much
a "n Nearly all the mills the owners have
a eood word to say for the men as re
gards the way they are conducting their
side of the affair. There has been abso
lutely no attempt at violence, and In the
few instances where non-union men have
been invited to Join the union there have
been no threats made, and if the work
men ware disinclined to Join the organiza
tion they were promptly let alone.
At the labor bureau rooms there is an
interesting scene every day and ni?ht.
The men gather there to discuss the situ
ation and read the papers. Collectively
the workmen are an intelligent set of
men. and if any bitterness is entertained
toward the owners the members keep it
to themselves. Their main issue is for
fair play, .which they firjnly believe will
come to them eventually.
SITUATION IN OAKLAND
REMAINS UNCHANGED
Pain, known as the fireworks king of
New Tork, London and Paris, has been
engaged through the enterprise of San
Francisco business men to brine his
greatest spectacular success, the "Battle
of San Juan." to San Francisco for a lim
ited season, opening: Saturday. September
l, and continuing nightly through tha
semi-centennial holidays.
The entire production is on the most
elaborate scale. 500 performers, athletes,
specialists, soldiers and officers partici
pating in the spectacle. The thrilling
bombardment, storming and capture of
Ban Juan Hill Is followed by a grand re
view of military bands and troops. Then
will* follow a $1000 display of Pain's
"World's Fair fireworks, the special fea
ture of which will be changed nightly.
/The spectacle will be located at Sixteenth
and Folsom streets grounds.
CAPTURE OF SAN JUAN
HILL WILL BE RECALLED
"No overtures have yet been made by
either side,"- he said, "and we cannot fore
see where the trouble will end. Despite
the assertions of some of the operatives
to the contrary, there have been no mills
reopened under the eight-hour schedule. I
must acknowledge, however, that one firm
belonging to the owners' combine has suc
cumbed to the eight-hour cryâ that of Ho
gan Brothers who operate a small mill in
connection with the business of the Hum
boldt Lumber Company. This mill employs
but two or three men, and these Irregu
larly, and Is operated simply t* tnrn out
special orders for the lumber company.
I suppose the Hogans seceded from our
organization because they feared their
lumber would not be handled.
"The other mills running eight hours,
McManus & Gartner's and the Zenith,
have been dotn;? so for years, paying their
men a proportionate rate of wages. Ken
dall's mill, in East Oakland, claimed by
the men to have agreed to the eight-hour
proposition, is running not eight but only
six and three-quarters hours a day. The
men are paid three-quarters time.
"The situation Is simply thisâ we cannot
pay our men ten hours' pay for an eight
hour day and at the same time be subject
to the competition of outside mills."
it is their Intention to act peaceably and
honorably in the present dispute. A squad
of police was sent to the mill at quitting
time, but found nothing to dp.
C. L. Ingler, president of the Alameda
County Mlllowners* Association, declared
to-day that there are no immediate pros
pects of a settlement of the differences
existing over the. demanded dent-hour
schedule.

that the most distinctive feature of the
decorations will be the entire absence of
anything in- the shape of flags, banners
or bunting strung low across the street at
any place. The headquarters banner now
stretched between the Palace Hotel and
the Crocker building is to be removed.
This will leave the street entirely open
and will absolutely do away with the
time-honored custom of giving the street
a backyard, washday, clothesline effect.

Grand Marshal Costello has been noti
fied that the Swedish-American societies

one of the attractive features of the pa
rade. At least 400 men will parade wear-
Ing white caps, white neckties, black
coats and wearing blue and yellow rib
bons. Two elaborate floats are to be In
cluded in the division. One float is to rep.
resent "Svea," guarded by soldiers In unU
form of the time of Charles XII. The
other float is to be representative of the
national costumes of Sweden and will call
into requisition the services of some flfty
ladies. A. O. Lundstrom will be marshal
of the division. Dr. Backman and K. A.
Lundstrom have been selected as aids.
In addition the societies will turn out
twenty-five men on horseback as a guard
to the main float.
Glen Ellen Parlor will contribute a
large number to the Native Sons' contin

Charles N. Bowen, a book agent living

When searched at the City Prison three

were found In Bowen's pockets. The
cashier cf Mosuague & Co. remembered
raying the Jit) subscribed by that firm, but
Le was not positive that iiowen was the
man to whom he paid it.
When Bowen was questioned by Captain
Eeymour Jie said that some printers had
employed him to collect money to buv the
plat, but he could not give any of their
Karaes. He denied that he had received
any money frexn the men on the list. '
In his room was found the following
peculiar letter in aa envelope:

The letter was in an envelope unsealed
end written on the envelope was, "In case
of serious telegraph my mother.
Mrs. R. Bowen, (^ Walnut avenue, Santa

President Gibb of the Typographical
Union called at poiice headquarters and
eaid he was almost satisfied 'that Bowen
Â¦was the man who sot money prior to the
last election by representing that he was
a collector for printers thrown out of jobs
throuph the introduction of machinery.
At that time he went under the name of
"Williams. He promised every assistance
of the union 5n prosecuting Bowen.
AN idea of what the parade will be
on the 10th of September may be
gathered from the fact that in ad
dition to the great division of the
Order of Native Sons of the Golden West
representing all sections of the State with
fourteen floats as far as heard from,
there will be in line the Ancient Order of
United Workmen, Ancient Order of For
esters, Order of Hermann's Sons, Im
proved Order of Red Men, State Floral
Society, Knights of Pythias, United An
cient Order of Druids.. Independent Or
der of Foresters, French colony and the
Swedish American Society, each with
floats, numbering in all as far as reported
eighteen; the Society of California Pio
neers, Veterans of the Mexican War, the
Old Friends, Independent Order B'nai
B'rith. Society of Golden Link's, San
Francisco Turn Verein, Scottish Thistle
Club, life-saving station crew, Horace
Mann School, Exempt Fire Company,
Sons of Exempts. Veteran Volunteer
Firemen's Association, Veterans of the
paid Fire Department, a delegation of the
paid Fire Department, Berkeley Fire De
partment. Petaluma Fire Department,
each with ancient or modern lire appa
ratus; the Naval Militia, with float:
United States marines, San Francisco
Schuetzen Verein, EIntracht Rifles, Veter
an Reserves, Veteran Volunteers, League
of the Cross Cadets, Second Brigade of
the National Guard and the Columbia
Boys' Club, a semi-military organization.
There are a number of other organiza
tions that have not yet given a decided
answer as to what part they will take in
the parade. The Improved Order of Red
Men will have several hundred men in
Indian costume. The float of the French
colony will be a magnificent affair. It
will be 17 by 9 feet, with California rep
resented by a young lady seated on a
dais, under a canopy. At the front of the
float will be two French Zouaves; in front
of California will be a figure to represent
the American Goddess of Liberty, with a
French woman to represent French cos
tumes in the period of colonial times, and
on the other side a figure of the French
Goddess of Liberty, with a woman at
tired in the costume of American colo
nial days. This will be decorated in a
t2Fteful manner and will be drawn by six
black horses.

hands of trustees during the life of. leases.
The purpose is to lease all oil land from
owners, according to the Los Angeles
Herald, and then to employe the owners
to develop the land, operate the wells and
deliver oil tb the Storage Transportation
Company. The payment for services will
be 90 per cent of the money received for
the oil so produced and sold. A mass
meeting will be held to consider the
scheme. The Herald furnishes the fol
lowing information: â¢
"Work Is being pushed and the result
will be known soon. The object , of Â¦ the
combhe is not to raise " the price of oil,
but to give prices stability. Prices will
be maintained at a reasonable scale that
will demonstrate to consumers the econ- '
omy of using oil. It is proposed to store
from '600,000 to 1,000,000 barrels of oil above
ground, so that the extent and adequacy :
of the supply can be relied upon that from ,

camp. The order to. move on the camp
was given, but as the troop approached it
was met by a volley from the picket line
and ?, 5 fi L e was returned. This somewhat
startled the horses, but they- soon became
accustomed to the reports, and the ad

she was lying cold in death. ,
Mrs. Patton went East in the latter
part of -May on the advice of her physi
cian. A short time ago news came that
she was in splendid health and wished to
return to California. At the same time
she complained greatly of the heat and
to this cause her friends are inclined to
ascribe her death. Being apprised of his
wife's wish Mr. Patton went to.Philadel
phia to bring her home. The news of her
death was the first greetingj he received.
Mrs. Patton was a native : of New Or
leans, 35. years old, and. an exceedingly
beautiful woman. She was married twelve
years ago. The Pattons.had no children,
but Mrs. - Patton leaves a sister. Miss
Grace. Bawer, who resided at the Patton
home, 2500 Broadway. ,
and Mr. Bryan would have an Impossible
task in explaining why.
"There is one thing to do, and It will be
done by the man of senseâ that is to work
hard and vote for the Republican ticket,
to the end that the enemies of prosperity
may be defeated. .
"My trip to the coast was for the pleas
ure of my family and self, and I am nappy
to say that it was satisfactory. It has
been declared that I went to Alaska to
investigate the situation in an official ca
pacity, but this is untrue. I went to the
north as an excursionist and had a de
lightful time, with the exception of the
hardships and Impositions I saw practiced
on American n-.iners on American terri
tory. Secretary of State Hay Is anything
but an American, and he has committed
an act for which he will be called to Ac
count in the next Congress. Fifty-seven
years ago the United States bought from
Russia certain territory in the north, and
that territory has been held and protected
by our Government for more than a half
century. The boundary line is, marked by
a church and a monument at one point
and it made me Indignant to see that the
British flag had driven out the Stars and
Stripes from a highly valuable stretch of
territory. This Is the assinine work of
Mr. Hay In agreeing to the temporary Una
of boundary- The American policy, which
is well fixed, is to never give up a foot
of land that has been honorably obtained
and thi3 policy should most certainly be"
followed in Alaska.
"It is anything but a pleasant experience
to have American miners come to onÂ©
with tears in their eyes and show where
they were ruined by the fact that the pro
tection of the flag had been taken from
them and they had been placed under the
dominion of the Britisher. There is no
excuse for the situation In the Northwest
and the matter will most certainly re
ceive serious attention in the next Con
gress.
, "When one comes to change the subject
and speak of the charms of San Francis
co, as to Its beauty and magnificence of
climate. language fails. I have been here
but a few hours, but I am seriously think
ing of going back to Illinois, selling out
my holdings and coming here to spend the
remainder of my days. You have a great
city and that city has a mighty future.
By these tokens we should all vote) for
takes the affair seriously.
The presence of Thomas T. Townsend
in the case Is also exciting a great deal
of curiosity. As the divorced husband of
Mrs. Townsend he has no standing and is
pleading, therefore, that there, were some
irregularities in the divorce proceedings
between him' and his wife by which the
validity of the decree was destroyed. It
is said that for twenty years after he and
his wife separated he had no knowledge
of his wife's whereabouts and actually be
lieved her to be dead. He knew nothing
of a divorce, it is claimed, and on that
ground will insist that at her death Mrs.
Townsend was legally his wife.
There Is little question, however, that
his subsequent marriages will seriously in
jure this contenti.fi. as in making these
marriages Townsend, in the eyes of the
law, presupposed and had a right to pre
suppose that be was legally free from his
first . wife. His appearance in the case
adds, however, another complication and
gives promise of some sensational disclos
ures. A prize of more than half a million
dollars is well worth fighting for, even if
the contestant wins only a part of it.
Mrs. Bessie Smith, suspected by Attor
neys Sullivan & Sullivan of having full
knowledge or the preparation of the al
leged forged will that so suddenly invad
ed the Townsend case, Is aimlessly seek
ing vindication. : Mrs. Smith made a hys
terical visit at Judge Dunne's chambers
yesterdaV morning, accompanied'by J. O.
Harron. Mrs. Smith entered the cham
bers. Her companion introduced her, then
stepped aside. "I went to seo Sullivan &
Sullivan," she said, "and they treated me
like a criminal; told me about the Grand
Jury and other things. I am innocent of
the* charge that I forged this will pre
sented In. court yesterday."
"No charge has been made against you
to my knowledge, madam," answered
Judge Dunne.
"The newspapers say so," said she ex
citedly^ "My good name has been, ruined.
The world believes me a forger, but I am
innocent."
Here Mrs. Smith became hysterical, but
on Judge Dunne assuring h'er that If her
statement was correct she had nothing to
fear she dried her eyes and said that she
wanted to be subpenaed to appear In
court. .
As she was leaving the court - William
Hiestcr. on behalf of Sullivan, & Sullivan,
served her with a cubpena. $:Â¦Â¦Â¦"Â¦
"I shall be on hand^ you may be as
sured." she paid, and 'with Mr. -Harron
left the building. \ "V - -
"There is no excuse for making a
change now; but the Democrats are
thirsty for power and spoils and they will
put up a good fight, unless all signs fail.
We of the East depend upon the Pacific
Coast to send us a solid delegation, and
it appears to me that they will deliver the
goods. On this occasion, however, every
Republican should vote, whether his- vote
is supposed to be needed or not. Our rail
road and manufacturing securities are
now in good demand on a gold basis, but
they are largely held in Europe, where the
Investor is very sensitive. In the event
of Bryan's election on the silver platform
of the last convention the majority of
these holders would order their holdings
sold for what they would bring in the
open market It would be absolutely im
possible for our buyers to protect the
stock and the inevitable crash would come
Â¦."Republicans should remember that this*
Is a great /political year," said he, "and
It Is particularly one In which there should
be no chances taken. They should be sure
that they are registered and they should
go to the polls and vote. That is all that
is necessary to put Mr. Bryan and his
party on the same toboggan they rode
upon in the previous campaign. However,
there is the possibility of being overconfi
dent. The battleground of this campaign
is In the States of New York, Indiana, Il
linois and Michigan. The people of the
United States, in the midst of the pros
perity that now blesses the country, do
not want a chairg-e of administration; they
do not want any 16 to 1 proposition with
the certainty that It will bring them dis
aster in a business way and paralyze in
dustries generally.
WHERE do I think Bryan will get
off at this coming election? Well,
if the Republicans exercise or
dinary care and go to the polls
as they should Mr. Bryan will get off at
the same station he did in 1896," said United
States Senator "William E. Mason of Il
linois at the Occidental Hotel last night.
Senator Mason arrived In the city yester
day from the north. He went to Alaska
with his family for an outing and Intends
to see something of California before re
turning home. He Is a genial man and
thoroughly posted on the political situa
tion, of which he talked freely. . '
Says There Is No Doubt Bryan Can Be Defeated
if Republicans Will Register and
Vote on Election Day.
He Considers the Alaska Boiaedary
Arrangement a Raek Out

MEMORIAL SERVICES FOR
WILLIAM LIEBKNECHT
Socialists Do Honor to the Name of
One Who Was Prominent in Â¦"â¢/'.
Their Banks.
Memorial services ' were held at the
Turk-street Temple last night for William
Llebknecht, deceased, late of Berlin, who
in life was a prominent socialist.
The .rostrum was appropriately decor
ated for the occasion and the attendance
was large. The services were interesting.
Remarks were made by Chairman. Cam
eron H. King and others, after which the
following resolutions were adopted:
"Whereas, By the death of William
Licbknecht of Berlin, the socialist move
ment of the world has lost one of its
noblest and ablest champions; and where
as, his efforts in behalf of the oppressed
proletariat were not confined to his native
country, but were impartially exerted for
the of all worklngmen in
all countries; be it therefore
"Resolved, That we socialist working
men of San Francisco hereby express our
sorrow at the loss of â¢ our great German
comrade; and be it further * .
"Resolved, That we pledge ourselves
anew to the support of that international
solidarity of our class which furnished
the motive of our comrade's long, useful
and illustrious career." . Â¦
A copy of these resolutions was ordered
forwarded to the family of the deceased
in Berlin. . '^fi88KPaManS9B
"died In Philadelphia, ' Pa.. October 2S.
1S&6. At the time of his death he was a
resident of San Francisco, leaving estate
therein of the vaJue of $2,0Q0,<Kk). The de
cedent left surviving him neither wife,
father, mother, brother, sister nor
nephew, and but one niece, the petitioner.
Laura. E. Tracy- Jacob Z. Davis never
had a. Bister a_rÂ»d but one brother, John
Davis, the petitioner's father. Jacob Z.
Davis and John Davis were full brothers,
being the sons of James Davis, a native
of Philadelphia- John Davis was born.
September 11. 1S15, and Jacob Z. Davis
was born May 2, 1S18. John Dav's died
January 17, 1^93, and left surviving him
the petitioner, his other children all hav
ing died in infancy. Jacob Z. Davis died
entirely without issue, hence the peti
tioner is nearest and only next of kin and
sole heir at law of Jacob Z. Davis.
"John Davis and Jacob Z. Davis were
left orphans in early infancy. The de
cedent, Jacob Z. Davis, was named by his
father, William Davis, and at or about
the time of his father's death was taken
into the family of Catherine Z. Dedaker
and brought up by her as her own child.
Catherine Dedaker changed decedent's
name from William Davis to Jacob Zieg
ler Dedaker, by which name he was
known during a portion of his boyhood.
Between the years of 1S30 and 1S35 he dis
covered the true name of his father and
abandoned the surname of Dedaker and
assumed that of his father. He retained
the given names Jacob Ziegler, however,
and until his death was known as Jacob
Z. Davis."
George W. Monteith is preparing for
the opposition he is cure to meet when
the hearing of his contest is called by
Judge Coffcy. The law that stands in the
v.-ay of an Immediate hearing of his con
test is contained in three sections- of the
Code of Civil Procedure. They bar the
right of a claimant to an estate who does
I not appear within a year after the.ad
j mission of the will to probate, even
though the claimant has been defrauded
and has had no notice of the probate pro
ceedings or knowledge of the commission
of the fraud. In civil actions the statute
of limitations does not commence to run
until after the discovery of the fraud.
The theory upon which the probate
statute of limitations is based is to pre
vent litigations over estates of the dead
and to concentrate all controversies at
law in as short a space of time as possible,
that as much of the estate aa possible
may be preserved for the heirs, and that
in the end those adjudged lawful claim
ants may enjoy the quiet possession of
their Inheritance without constant fear of
ouster.
Attorney Montieth contends that these
statutes by protecting 1 possible fraud
after a stated period has elapsed operate
to deprive lawful claimants of property
without due process of law and- in viola
tion of the constitutionâ the highest law
in the land.
3IRS. LATJRA E. TRACY.
JACOB Z. DAVIS* last will, the
strar.g-e holographic instrument that
once successfully withstood the as
sault of dis&atlsfled heirs, must
bear the brur.t of another legal battle.
Sirs. Laura E. Tracy, who claims to be
the niece and the only surviving blood
relative of the dead millionaire, has ar
rived in San Francisco and instituted pro
ceedings to break the wilL Mrs. Tracy
charges that it is a forgery. This charge
has once been refuted by Belle Curtis and
Lizzie Muir. who under the terms of the
disputed testament have long since come
into possession of the vast estate of the
deceased.
In addition to the difficulty of proving
the will a forgery, aa effort which proved
unavailing to Catherine Stead and Joseph
P. Wilson, the first contestants. Mrs.
Tracy is confronted with the diSicult
problem of obtaining a standing in court.
Many months more than a year have
passed since the Davis estate was dis
tributed to Belle Curtis and Lizzie Muir.
itnd years have gone by. since the will
was admitted to probate. Under the stat
utes Mrs. Tracy is barred, but her attor-
George \V. Monteith. says the techni
calities of practice will avail his client,
and he will win his point even though it
may be before the Supreme Court of the
United States.
While the legal battle was being waged
In the local courts over the testament
which Belie Curtis and Lizzie Muir allege
was found in the mortuary urn covered by
the ashes of the millionaire's wife, Mrs.
Tracy was living quietly in Hawaii, un
mindful of the contest and without knowl
edge of her uncle's death. When she
learned of the facts she immediately came
to this city to press her claim. She was
Advised that she had slept too long on her
rights and that her chance was gone.
(Jeorge W. Monteith. after looking into
. her case, however, was convinced that if
fraud was committed, which he is con
fident was the case, be could obtain a
standing in -court for hie client. Mrs.
Tracy then proved to the satisfaction of
her attorney that she was in fact the only
surviving heir of the deceased, and he bZM
in conseyueace set the wheels of contest
in motion.
.. In her complaint Mrs. Tracy alleges
that she Is a daughter of John Davis, a
brother of the dead capitalist. Her al
legations of conspiracy, traud and forgery
are then set torth in detail. Belle Curtis,
Lizzie Muir, John *-V. Curtis, husband of
Uelle Curtis, and Michael Ryan, who
swore he found the disputed will in the
mortuary urn, are charged with con
epirwey to secure possession of the $2,000,-
O'/j estate of the deceased by means of a
forged will and perjured testimony. This
was made possible, it is alleged, by the
death of Jacob Z. Davis' wife, as a will
of latent date than that under which her
nieces. Belle Curtis and Lizzie Muir, se
cured'the estate, which bequeathed" the
estate to Mrs. Davis, became inoperative
through lack of any person to take pos>
ecssion under its provisions. The de
ceased, it is claimed, had no knowledge
/cf the existence of Mre. Tracy. Many
f | â¢ ars ago the brothers separated and lost
â¢track of each other. Jacob long believed
tna.1 John was dt ad and of his family he
Sinew nothing. Mrs. Tracy also believed
fcÂ«r father's brother had been dead for
many years and it was not until the lat
ter part of 1Â£Â£3 that she learned that hij
passing was of recent years and that he
left behind him a fortune. Continuing the
complaint sets forth the charges of for
gery and conspiracy.
â¢â¢The conspirators." it reads, "after get
ting together certain instruments that had
been executed by the deceased, procured
a piece of paper, commonly known a*
foolscap, and after laying the same over
various writings traced. Imitated and sim
ulated the handwriting of the deceased
and completed the forged will that wac
accepted as genuine. Many of the trac
ings when compared with the exemplars
us<*d for the purpose of completing the
forgery are in exactly the same propor
tion and situation therein as in the genu
ine codicil attached to the inoperative |
will bequeathing decedent's estaro to hi.* j
wife. The signature on the forged will as I
a whole conforms accurately to the same
In the genuine codicil, so far as conforma
tion, proportion, size and measurement
go- dUTcrent, however, only in f=uch minor J
detail as would ordinarily occur in trac
ing. and the signature of the forged will
showing upon examination under a mag
nifying glass all of the characteristics of I
a tracing and none of the characteristics !
thÂ«t manifest themselves in the genuine
el/n.ature on the codicil." !
'jP-.at portion of the complaint which
tfaees Mrs. Tracy's kinship to the de- !
ceased is the interesting portion of the
document.
"Jacob Z. Davis," the complaint reads.
THE Townsend case promises to be
enlivened with a series of sensations
before the estate of the dead woman
passes out of the hands of the Pro
bate Court. It Is safe to say tliat the
mysterious will, which was produced in
court by the attorneys for Mrs. Klla F.
Murray, represents only the opening skir
mish of a legal campaign which will be
replete with scandal. This strange testa
ment, which all the attorneys in the case
except Sullivan & Sullivan look upon as
a joke, was the theme yesterday of con
siderable serious discussion. Everybody in
the case is striving to discover whence
this strange document came and what
motive prompted its interjection into the
controversy.
Nobody except the attorneys for Mrs.
Ella F. Murray thinks for a moment that
Mrs. Bessie- Tracy Smith had anything
whatever to do with the will, which ap
pears to be spurious on its face. Mrs.
Smith could have had absolutely no sane
reason for writing the clumsy affair In the
first place or of sending it in the second,
and no one in the case Is yet ready to ac
cuse Mrs. Smith of insanity. If spe had
been prompted by any selfish motive and
hoped to deceive the daughter of Mrs.
Townsend it is argued that she would have
made some provision in the document for
herself. * â¢ â¢
Xone of the other parties in interest in
the case could have had a motive in writ
ing the will, as its provisions are^J-ust
what Mrs. Murray demands, and no mo
tive of deception could have succeeded, as
Miss Nellie Rattigan. to whom the docu
ment was mailed, was with Mrs. Town
send on July 19, day and night, and knew
that the old woman did not write such a
Ion?, clumsy testament, or, as a matter
cf fact, any at" all. Further than this,
Miss Rattigan knew that no Mrs. M. Bell,
who appears to be a myth, or any other
woman was with Mrs. Townsend on July
19 without the knowledge of Miss Rattl
gan. No motive of self-interest or of de
ception on the part of the opponents of
Mis. Murray could have prompted the
fabrication of the forgery. And still every
body is guessing who could have commit
ted the crime and why.
Miss Rattigan is being commended for
her exceptional discretion in the matter.
"When she received the letter addressed to
her, opened It and found what purported
to be the will of Mrs. Townsend, a natu
ral impulse would have been to open the
inner envelope and Inspect its contents.

VAXCOT.-VER. B. C, Aug. 18.â Robert
N. Johnston, champion oarsman of
:hp Pacific Coast, defeated John L.
Hackett of Seattle this evening In
a three-mile race with turn, for a
purse of J1000. It was a hot race all
through, in which physical condition and
magnificent ftccring won the day for the
Vancouver oarsman.
The men caught the water together
when the starter's gun was fired, amid
the cheers of a crowd of at least 12.000
fteopie. They cut a merry clip, Johnston
rolling thiitv-=ix Ftrckes to the minute in
the nrpt half-mile and the Seattle man
thirty-five. He If way down the course
Hackett nearly collided with a cable barge
and lost at least two lengths. Then Hack
ett straightened away and went after
Johnston, rowing at least forty-one
strokes to the minute. He literally lifted
his frail shell out of the water, and the
little craft phot forward under his power
ful strokes with the speed of a frightened
deer. Ten yards from the turning buoy
the Seattle man was again on even terms
with his rival. Both made beautiful turns
and set out for home, pulling thirty-six to
the minute and apparently not a hair's
breadth between them. Less than a quar
ter of a mil** had been covered when John-
Fton commenced to gain, and although
Hackett did his utmost to cut down the
small load, Johnston j>till held his advan
tage. Then came the time when the lead
increased and Hackett realized a losing
game when half way back over the course.
Johnston rowed clean without a splash.
STILL ANOTHER
VICTORY ADDED
TO HANK'S LIST
Dudes Found Fitzpatrick,
but They Were Full
of Errors.
San Franclscos 5, Oaklands 4.
Hank Harris, if there is any piety in bl3
heart, should offer a sacrifice to Dame
.Fortune for her gift bestowed upon him
yesterday afternoon at Recreation
grounds. Fireman Fitz was on the slab
â¢working the curve generator. Until the
eighth inning things were not polluted by
poisonous baseball, but then ! Fitz was
solved and five hits In succession sent as
many shafts of pain Into Hank. He
wreaked vengeance by putting Iburg In
the box then and there. * The five hits tied
the score.
What Oakland did by hitting San Fran
cisco was secured by the errors of her
opponents. In the fourth inning, when the
daub charm over- the right cheekbone of
each of Hank's stickers began to work
its spell, the Dudes went to pieces, and by
a combination of errors and a single hit
San Francisco scored three runs. "Brew
er" Pabst and "John L." were sent to the
packs on errors, a hit. by ancient Rubo
and extra errors by the Oakland infield
before the inning was over scored Pabst,
Sullivan and Krug. In the fifth Schwartz,
whose running was done by Levy and
Krug in relays, was accredited with a run.
In the seventh came the tie, which re
sulted in Fireman Fitz being put out.
Held hit and Moskiman hit. So did Dren
nan and Hutchlnson and Francks. scoring
four men before the side was retired.
The tie was shattered in the eighth,
when Heine Krug covered the plate, after
reaching the first sack on a hit and third
on Rellly's double. What Bent him home
to victory was an error of Arrellanes,
who threw badly to the plate on a hit by
Brockhoff. The score:

Johnston made his linal effort and crossed
the line eight lengths ahead. Time, 20M6.
Hackett declares that Johnston has
vastly Improved since their last race.
Johnston will challenge Gaudaur, the
present world's champion, at once, and it
is expected his challenge will be turned
over to Ten Eyck, the American oarsman.
The race to-day was practically a
world's championship event Jake Gau
daur, champion of tho world, who has
held the proud title since he won it from
Hanlan ten years ago, has qalt the busi
ness. He has bought a hotel in one of the
American pleasure lesorta on Lake Supe
rior and will row no more races. Gaudaur
is now 46 years old, and yet it is doubtful
If any of tho younper men could defeat
him for the next half dozen years. He has
signified his intention of handing over the
championship either to the winner of to
day's race or to Ten Eyck, the American
crack, whom he thinks Is one of the best
oarsmen in the business. He recently
watched him at Detroit and- there said
that it was either that man or one of .the
Western boys that would receive -the
championship from him.
Of the two men who rowed here to-day
one is a Canadian and the other an Amer
ican. Robert N. Johnston is a native of
St. Stephen, N. B., 28 years of age. At
one time he was a fast mile runner and a
sprinter of 6orae ability. He took up row
ing ten years ago and gave the back wash
to every prominent amateur in the coun
try. Two years ago his most notable
race was with Dr. McDowell of Saratoga,
and In two heats he won from him. Med
als and trophies soon lost their- value to
Johnston and he yearned to enter the
professional ranks and go after big game
and Incidentally big money. He met with
a fair amount of success, but a Jonah ac
companied the Vancouver man in nearly
every race. His boat woulH either strike
a piece of driftwood or some part of his
anatomy would go wrong, and It was al
ways the other fellow who won. He rowed
against Jake Gaudaur a year and a half
ago in Vancouver harbor for the world's
championship, but at that time proved no
match for the big man from Rat Portqge.
who won easily. Then Johnston went up
against John L. Hackett, who met him
to-day, and was again a loser. His
friends claimed that he had not been
properly trained, was too heavy, was
poorly boated and was forced to sit in his
shell half an hour before the race in a
biting wind. This year Johnston got dewn
to hard work and was in splendid shape
to-day.
John L. Hackett eo closely resembles
Gaudaur in stature and build that he
iniarht be thp champion's brother. He has
been rowing about < fifteen years, and
pul'.ed against all the fast men on tho
continent/ Lately he has lived in Seattle,
where he istan athletic favorite;

The rundown of the big 128-dog open
stake at Union Park yesterday was re
plete with, good coursing. Favorites more
than held their own, allowing the short
ends to pain only an occasional decision.
Reve de Amour, the Pasha Kennels* re
cent Importation, made an excellent show
ing against Deckelman's Kanaka. She
took to the game In fine style and by her
clever work gained a host of admirers.
Lopez's Sara lost the flag In a bye with
Bowery Boy by her indifferent work.
Bowery Boy had been beaten badly by
Sara'8 kennel mate Pepita earlier in the
day. Going against a fresh dog with this
handicap he was forced on the short end
at 3*Â£ to 1, but he was fast enough to
keep her out of the going and won as he
pleased.
Mayflower beat Imported Temple In a
clever go. Her chances in the stake are
good, though she is underweight.
Sir Pasha exhibited more speed than any
of the entries and is well favored for the
final. Royal Flush had a close shave with
Scottish Chief. As a rule he shows his
poorest form Â»n his first go and Improves
as he gets down the stake.
Palo Alto had speed enough against
Lady Davenport, but played off the game,
a dangerous habit which might lose a
course for him at any time.
Whitehead, Flying Fox and Mac's Mel

Not Weakness-

By far the greater number of patients, how-
ever, seekinjr relief for ao-called -Weakness" is
furnished by healthy and robust men. On ex-
amination, we find a Prostate Gland which hu
been damasred by either a contracted disorder
or early dissipation. These patients have no
weakness at all. Prematureness. Loss of Vital-
ity etc.. are the symptoms, or disordered func-
tion of the chronically Inflamed prostate gland.
We "find by eurlns this inflammation that full
vlgror at once returns. . It should be understood
that tonics, electricity, etc.. might cure a real
weakness, but would do barm in inflammation.
The main object is to reduce the size of tha
tender, swollen and Inflamed prostate. This wa
accomplish by local treatment, thus avoidir,"
drugs. Men who. have unsuccessfully treated
for a weakness should now understand the
cause of failure. We send free on application a

useful In home diagnosis and interesting to all

Two unsuccessful attempts at suicide
by the bathtub route and a prevented
plunge Into the chilly waters of the es
tuary is the unusual record of Marguerite
Smith/ a woman who was sentenced this
morning: to thirty days for vagrancy. The
woman came before Judge Smith in the
Police Court, and after pleading guilty
and being sentenced was removed tem
porarily to the City Prison.
Within an hour screams were heard
from her cellmate, Georglna Fralzell, and
on arrival at the spot Policemen Moore
and Curtiss found the Smith woman, fully
dressed, struggling to submerge herself
In the water, while her companion sought
to prevent her.
The would-be suicide fought the officers
fiercely, but was removed and wrapped in
a blanket. To-morrow she will be taken
to the County Jail 'to serve her sentence.
The woman's mania for drowning her
self appeared a few weeks ago, when she
was prevented by some boys from throw-
Ing herself Into Oakland Creek. After
being arrested at that time she tried to
drown herself In the prison bathtub, but
was rescued and locked up In a separate
celL. She declares she will yet accomplish
her purpose^ -

BY F. E.^^ MTJLHOLLAJNTD.
Again to-day society paid homage to the
sport of kings, the grand stand, the club
house and inner field presenting a pic
turesque sight, with exquisitely gowned
women, fashionably attired men and swell
turnouts. Strangely enough, the wager
ing was not fierce, the light fields confin

to tho favorites, and the short-priced
afternoon at the racecourse the
guards sounded a farewell blast of the
horns In one of the most successful weeks
of sport ever held at this fashionable re

Â¦ Considerable speculation was Indulged
in over the result of the Del Monte cup
for ponies, the minimum weight being
fixed at 165 pounds. Fusillade, ridden by
Walter Hobart, and Lady Betty, the
Carolan entry, the latter piloted by her
owner, received strong support to defeat
the favorite, Viola, upon which Mr. Bet
ner had the mount. The latter had a phe
nomenal turn of Bpeed and i could never
be headed, though hard pressed by Fusil
lade for six furlongs. Lady Betty came
strong at the close, taking the place from
her stable mate. Time, 1:53. Mutuels

In order^To grlve Republican citizens as
surance of a fair primary election the fol
lowing declaration was adopted:
Thin committee recognizes the great Im
portance to our country of the success of
the .Republican party and its principles at
the coming election, and knowing that only
by the fairest dealing both as to ifsues and
as to men can such success be honorably
attained, hereby declares Its intention to ex
erclee the power vested in it in. such man
ner as consistently with Integrity and pro
priety shall give to every 'Republican voter
: in San Francisco equal and fair recognition
In the primary election about to be held.
And to that end and purpose and In ac- '
cordance with the resolution adopted by the
County- Committee this committee declares
that no fraud. Imposition, intimidation or-Â»
- oppression will be tolerated ae* the said
primary election and hereby gives notice
that when It shall appear by satisfactory
proofs that any false voting shall have oc
curred at any polling place or any false or
fraudulent impersonation of electors, or any
repeating or "stuffing" or false counting
of votes in the interest of any set of can
didates, the return of the election of such
candidates will not be received or con
sidered.
This declaration is thus made In advance
to discourage all possible reprehensible and
fraudulent practice, and to Insure a fair arid
honest primary election, as far as It may be
within the power of the Republican County
STEPS TO SECURE

Republican Committee of Eighteen
Gives Notice That Fraud
B 'Â¦ ' Shall Not Prevail.
Committee to secure the same.
In order to adjust differences In various
Assembly districts and to promote har
mony In the ranks of the party a com
mittee was appointed consisting of T. II.
McCarthy. A. Ruef, I. J. Truman Jr., J.
F. McGlynn and William Metzner.
The chairman also announced the ap
pointment of the following committee on
finance:
Ueorge r>. Clarke. H. E. Holmes. Xathan
Frank, George W. Pennlngton and Charles
F. Engolke.
Late Friday evening a petition purport
ing to be signed by twenty-five members
of the County Committee was presented
to the chairman. The petitioners asked
that a special meeting of tho County Com
mittee be called to consider the advisabil
ity of appointing a committee to carry
into effect the plan of primary election
edoÂ»ted Saturday evening, August 11. The
chairman replied to the communication,
setting forth that the committee had been
appointed under authority derived from
section 3 of the by-laws. The chairman
therefore decided against calling a special
meeting in view of the near approach of
the 'election and the necessity, for active,
work to carry out the provisions of the
plan adopted by the general committee.
No doubt the petition was signed by sev
eral well-meaning county commltteemen.
but Chairman Bouvler and members of
the executive committee clearly perceived
that disturbing elements would make the
meeting a special occasion for causing
confusion and delay.
The - followers of Kelly and Crimmins
are not all satisfied with the outspoken
declaration in favor of an honest primary
election. They have v been fighting des
perately for opportunity to stuff ballot
boxe< and gain control of the local nom
inating convention. In their zeal to con
trol legislative nominations they threaten
to disrupt the party organization and hold
a bolters' convention.
Republican Tvorkin??rnen. merchants and
business men generally expect the Coun
ty Committee to stand firm and carry
out the promise that a fair and honest
primary election shall be held. Decent
Republicans know that Kelly and Crlm
mins cannot be trusted to give the peo
ple a fair deal. These bosses betrayed
and knifed a Republican candidate for
Oovernor and a Republican candidate for
Mayor.

The time has passed when any old
clothes that a traveler might possess were
accounted good enough for an ocean voy
age. Indeed, the dressing of passengrers
on some ocean liners has recently become
so elaborate that persona looking for ease
and informality are alarmed at the rapid
ity with which the former ideas on this
subject a^e changing.
"I crossed on one of the big ocean liners
in May," said a New Yorker who had Just
returned from Europe, "and three-quar
ters of the men on board put on evening 1
dress for dinner. The crowd on board was
made for the most part of New Yorkers
and amonsr them were a number more or
less conspicuous in society. My first im
pulse after the first night at dinner was
to follow the example of others and put
on evening dress the next night. But I
thought the matter over and decided that
I wctuld travel as I always had and at
tempt nothing absurd. Besides. I thought
that the number of men in evening dress
might be considerably reduced. But my
hope was not realized. It was the Eng
lish, who boast of their common sensee
method of traveling, who began this thinsr.
The first men I ever saw in evening dres3
on a steamer were two young Englishmen
on their way to this country. And dress
ing is still more elaborate on those steam
ers patronized by the English."â New

A Polish prince, who lives In a spIendM
house on the Avenue du Bols de Boulogne,
Paris, used to be set down by his ac
quaintances as a miser because he never
entertained. Last winter lifty of his
friends were astonished by an invitatron
from him to dinner. They went, and sat
down % to a magnificent feast in a huge
room, one end of which was covered by
a great screen of white silk. Oysters were
served on beds of powdered Ice, when sud
denly the electric lamps died away, and on
a screen flashed out a living picture of
women standing shivering knee-deep in
freezing water, picking oysters from the
rocks. With the fish course a smack waa
seen pitching so heavily that the guests
cried in terror. "Oh. they will be
drowned!" Men and women next appeared
working in the vineyards on a wet. misty
day. ankle-deep in gray slush. With every
magnificent course fre*h scenes of misery
passed in silence before the saddened
guests. The Prince had revenged himself
for their cruel remark*, but at an esti
mated cost of over 120,000.

secure profits. September opened %@Hc lower
at 72%<a72Â»ic, and after a few weary efforts to
hold its head up, subsided to 71%c. It was
under 72c that most of the covering by scalp
ers was done. This, coupled with the buying
of 200.000 bushels by a commission house.' about
the only good-sized order of the day, resulted
In a' recovery to 72Hc, at which the market
closed, a decline of %Â®%c from yesterday.
Corn felt the wheat weakness and the stop
page of the shipping demand 'caused - by the
recent advance in prices for this and the next
month's delivery. September, which closed
yesterday at 39',',c. was offered at the opening
to-day at 38%Â©38%c. The close was %c lower
at 38V4c â¢
Oats were quiet, but comparatively steady.
September closed Uc down at 2l%021Â»ic.
Provisions were slow, but showed an under
tone of firmness. Local buying, especially of
shqjtf ribs, and the selling of product for Jan
uaff "delivery, were the features. September
pork closed l&c over yesterday, lard 2H@5o

As the time approached for the publication
0%, the bank statement business became very
restricted. The statement met general expecta
tions as to the cash leÂ«s of $S,342,PO0. Areom
modatiuns to the underwriting syndicate In con
nection v. :th the British loan accounted for the
greater part of the increase of loans of $6,837.-
O0Q. Pt-posits were reduced $3.O*l,CO0 and thÂ«
genera! effect was the shrinkage in surplus
rÂ«Hwrv* of V,9Cb.i&i. A replenishment of the
banks' lci-reÂ« this week is expected to occur
advices from Pacific Coast points an
nouncing the receipts of $4,000,000 Alaskan gold.
This, it is believed, will be made available to
the local 1 arl'y by Government drafts on the
FubuÂ»Â»sury here. In addition rÂ«aymÂ«Â»nts are
now being made on account of the redemption
of the old Government 2s, Involving some $20,
onfi.OOO. With these factors taken Into conslder
etÂ»op ho general uneasiness is felt as to the
immediate future of the money market.
The Wall etreet axiom, "When gold goes^out,
Etocks go down," for once was exp'.&dM this
week, as the shipment of over $$.000,000 was
attended by rlFlnt prices. As the exportation
of . over 5:7.000,000 daring the past two weeks
dees not rr.ak- very eerlous Inroads on the
country'* r.'jldirir?, and as constant accessions
Â¦re being received from natural sources, Wall
etreft's equanimity was not surprising. Where
the drain will be moft keenly felt Is In the re

WASHINGTON. Aug. 18.â To-day's statement
of the Treasury balances in the general fund,
exclusive of the $150,000,000 gold reserve In the
division of redemption, shows: Available cash
balance. $139,511,771: gold, $7Â»,051,259.
Condition of the Treasury.
Considerable cash will be distributed this
week on account of the refunding of the ex
tended 2 per cent Government bonds, which will
go a long way toward replacing the gold lost
by export.
NEW YORK. Aug. IS.â The Financier says:
Practically every change in the showing of the
r*ew York banks can be traced to gold exports.
The loss in cash aggregated 8.341,800, of which
amount $8 106.800 was specie and $234,900 legal
*? n 2fSi J} fannot be said that the shrinkage
â¢ uh it' i n the sur P lu Â» reserve corresponds
,i .iÂ° ther . ch a n ses in the statement. The con
traction should have been considerably larger
7L n^ heavy decrase in cash, together with
w*L U r f5* e Of W-^LSOO In deposits, which
â¢ f-Z^,}; , reccrve requirements to the extent
Â°' *'Â»0.000, is taken into consideration. An in
crease in loans under normal conditions Is gen
%??"y.^ccompanied by an Increase in deposits.
The discrepancy In the two Items is attributed
to operaUons Incident to the British exchequer
loan. In other words, the gold withdrawn from
the banks for export has been entered on the
books as a loan. Therefore, the specie con
traction prevented an increase In deposits which
would have resulted had the loans been made
by means of checks and not by actual with
drawals of cash. It is evident from the de
crease in deposits that the statement would
have actually revealed a contraction in loans

The Cured Fruit Association will not name
prices for Prunes until It ascertains fully
what the sire and quality of the crop will be,
which is sensible. The growers are watching
the Association ; closely for results, and the
directors seem to be proceeding with commend
able care. ."As the bulk of. the crop will be un
usually small in size It would 6eem to bo
policy on the part of the Association to protect
these small sizes in finally naming the prices.
The large sizes can take care of themselves.

to have died In Valparaiso. The first no
tice his relatives received of hia alleged
decease was through a death notice pub
lished in the New York Herald. On read
ing the notice Mrs. Wethered, his mother,
who resides at 2109 Pacific avenue, cabled
to the American Consul and the officers
of the Valparaiso. Steamship Company' to
ascertain If the report were correct. . No
answer has yet been received and none
can be expected until Monday, a cable
taking two days to reach the South Amer
ican city. Mrs. Wethered is Inclined to
credit the - report; Â¦ The lieutenant ' has ' a
wife and three children In Berkeley. :
S^lim Woodworth was a retired lieuten
ant of the United States: navy.; On the
outbreak, of the' Spanish-American ' war
he re-entered the service, assuming- his old
rank. Ills last ship was the Nero. His

-The California Construction Company,

has ' held one-fourth of the stock. The
company has become Interested In con
struction work for the Government at
San Pedro and has finally accepted Gen
eral Wariield's offer for its holdings, in
stock of the scenic railway.
Since that transaction General Warfleld
has been elected vice president and a di
rector of the Mount Tamalpais road. S.
B.,Cushing continues as .president of the
corporation.
General Warfleld's wide experience as
a hotel man will serve the company well.
While he will not have direct charge of
the Tavern of Tamalpais his Judgment
will be accepted by the management in all
matters concerning it, as well- as in ef
forts to make the railway and the hotel
better known throughout the East and
to tourists generally.
About three months ago General War
field became impressed with the possibil
ities of the railway and the tavern of
Tamalpais in view of the great beauty of.
the /Mount Tamalpais scenery. He began
trying to get hold of some of the stock,
but found that none of It was for sale
and his efforts were at first fruitless.
Part of the stock of the Mill Valley and
Mount Tamalpais Railway Company has
passed into other hands and with the
change there is promised a new era in
management that will make the line one
of the best advertised scenic railways in
the country. General R: H. Warneld is
the new owner of stock in the corporation,
he having lately secured control of one
fourth of it.

"I do not .think that Harris thought he
was doing anything very wrong when he
committed the act," he said. "In fact,
I think it was a very trivial offense. But
discipline must be maintained. He was a
very efficient and, useful man to the de
partment. \He has been suspended and I
do not know whether he will be reinstated
or: not. Â¦''Â¦Â¦. When:' Harris was questioned
about 1 the hauling of the meat by a mem
ber of the department he excused himself
by , saying that it was done during the
noon hour. I regret that the story is to
become â¢} public, as I hoped the matter
would pass unnoticed." -
Harris is at present- out of town, but he
stated to friends before leaving that he
had put money into the shop, which l^ln

Commissioner Rolla V. Watt, when in

about the affair: â¢
â¢Robert J. Harris Is no longer superin

The action of the California Miners' As
sociation in reference to the Polar Star
mine ca.=e has attracted much attention
and a variety of comments In the Interior
counties. Some of the comments are
based upon an evident misunderstanding
of the actual happenings at the meeting
of the association last week. A commit
tee was appointed to employ counsel, the
committee consisting of W. C. Ralston,
Fred Zcltter. Edward H. Benjamin. Ed
ward Coleman, Harold T. Power, Dan T.
Cole and J. S. McBride. Among the ar
ticles published in Placer County Is one
written by Chris Runckel of Dutch Flat,
which appeared In the Colfax Sentinel,
purporting to give the facts concerning
the Polar Star mine. Some extracts are
given to Indicate the attitude taken by
