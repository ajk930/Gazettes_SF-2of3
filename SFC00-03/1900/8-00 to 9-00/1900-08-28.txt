to send a gunboat to Amoy, not because
of any particular apprehension as to Jap
anese aspirations, but to prevent rioting
at this dangerous point. . â¢. â¢
.The description of the action reported
by Chaffee tallies Identically with that
previously reported by Admiral Remey la
the above cable and Is identified with It
by War Department officials. - The explan
ation of the delay in the War Depart
ment's report is that Colonel Wlnt, who
commands the Sixth Cavalry, probably
forwarded his report to his superior at
Peking and General Chaffee then sent it

port of an engagement previously report
ed by Admiral Remey in a cable dated
Taku. August 20. In which he said: "Morn
ins of 19thâ Sixth Cavalry and about 400
English and Japanese dispersed about
1000 Boxer? outside of Tientsin; about 100
Chinese killed, five Americana wounded."
WASHINGTON'. Aug. 27.â War Depart

The last dispatch of the day was the
one from Minister Conger referring to the
military situation in Peking. Unfortun
ately it lacked a date, the Minister pre
sumably not having yet -received, the-de
partment's instructions to include the date
in the body of his dispatch. The State
Department at first undertook to have the
cablo companies correct this serious omis
*icn but finally, concluding from internal
evidence that Mr. Conger's message was
certainly later than any oflicial emanation
from the Chinese capital, the message was
allowed publicity for what it was worth.
It was as follows.
Conger Again Heard From.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 27.-After
several days' intermission in
Chinese advices, the Govern
ment to-day received two dis
patches which presumably
bring Us advices up to the most v recent
date There are indications that the prin
cipal delays in the lines of communication
are encountered between Tientsin and
Peking, a fact explanable by ,the news
paper advices that small bands of Boxers
are operating on the line of communica
tion of the Peking campaign force.
such interference with the work of the
Signal Corps men was experienced by the
United States force in the Philippines and
by Lord Roberts' troops In the Transvaal
campaign. Usually these Interruptions
are very short, the marauders being
driven off and the lines restored within
a dav or two. The fact that more than
a week was covered by the last interrup
tion gives rise to the belief here that these
attacks Â«pon the lines of communication
by Boxers are more formidable than was
supposed to be possible, after the heav>
losses inflicted upon them by the inter
national forces in its advance.
practically vacant. Two thousand
Germans arrived to-day. CONGER.
Mr. Conger's reference to the. arrival
of 2000 fresh German troops caused some
surprise, no one apparently having closely
watched the movements of the contingent
which is now arriving with fairly regular
frequency In China and which consequent
ly may be expected soon to ' equal in
numerical strength the military contin
gents of any of the Europeans there rep
resented.
May Make Negotiations.
, A significant statement in Minister Con
ger's dispatch is that respecting the ap
pearance in Peking of some of the mem
bers of the Tsung 11 Yamen. A natural
construction to be given to this statement
is that, these Ministers wish to undertake
to represent the Chinese Government
formally in negotiations with the powers.
It having been found impossible up to this
moment, according to Mr. Conger's state
ment, to meet any representatives of thÂ«
Chinese Government in Peking who were
competent to open negotiations, It may bo
inferred that; if these Ministers actually
appear with proper credentials one of the
problems connected with â¢ the present dif
ficulty in China will be solved. With some
responsible person or persons to dear with
it may be possible for the United States
to come to some agreement as to a settle
ment of the Chinese. trouble. Everslnce
the fall of Peking the principal difficulty
confronting the Government here has been
to arrange for the next movement In its
programme. It could not withdraw its'
troops, even if so disposed, without ar
ranging for indemnification for the heavy
cost it has been put to in the Peking
campaign. Also it mustmake>arrange
ments with some responsible authority for
the future protection of American inter
ests In China, as our .business interests
cannot bo withdrawn along with the army

Â¦ Therefore -..'as -'conveying a faint" hope
that In the persons of .these members of

some authorized ' representative of the

of Inquiry recently addressed by the United States Government to foreign
powers as to accepting the aged viceroy as peace envoy of the Chinese Gov

arrangements for the arrival of LI Hung Chang and the privileges he should
e allowed were discussed.
A proposition waj made that Li Hung should not bo allowed on reaching
liku to communicate with the Chinese officials in Peking. The proposition was
ai-eptable to most of the admirals, but the American officers declined to sien
th- agreement. Whether the Russian admiral signed is not known "but in anv

ADMIRALS DIFFERED
AS TO LI HUNG CHANG
"Russian journals agree," says the Moscow correspondent
of the Standard, "that it is impossible to deal with China in the
spirit of revenge, as suggested by Emperor William. They believe
that methods less drastic can better accomplish the ends of Russia
in Manchuria. The question would be satisfactorily settled to
Russian minds by the seizure of the northern provinces.'"
A special from St. Petersburg quotes Emperor William,
when wiring in answer to the announcement that a Russian
regiment had been named after him, as follows: "Express my
good wishes to-day with all the greater joy since our Russian
and German comrades, after a long time, are fighting together
again, shoulder to shoulder. According to an old arid snored
tradition, victor}' will not be wanting."
LONDON, Aug. 28, 3:50 a. m. â The allies, resuming ag
gressive operations, have taken the district west of Pe
king. This statement, based on Chinese authority, is cabled
from Shanghai. From the same place comes the further state
ment that Li Hung Chang has wired the Empress Dowager at
Sianfu requesting the arrest of Prince Tuan and the disarma
ment of the Boxers in order to give him an opening for negotia
tions with the powers.
The illuminations projected at Shanghai in celebration of
the relief of Peking have been abandoned, lest they should cause
a native outbreak.
"Evidence has been received here," says the Shanghai cor
respondent of the Standard, "going to show that General Lung
Wu was the real author of the anti-foreign outbreak, the Em
press Dowager, Prince Tuan and the others all having been pur
suadecl by him to take an extreme attitude, while he stood aside
and awaited developments."
American refugee missionaries in Amoy, according to the
Hongkong correspondent of the Daily Mail, are anxious to re
turn to the interior, but the United States has forbidden them to
do so and urges them to go to the Philippines or to return to
America.
Shanghai advices to the Daily News say that consular opin
ion there looks upon the Japanese action in the landing of troops
at Amoy, despite the protests of the Consuls, as similar to that of
Russia at Niuchwang, the whole indicating a tendency to a par
tition of the empire.

Hankow Uprising Not Due to
Boxers, but a plot of Reform
ers Against the Peking Gov
ernment.
Twelve of the Conspirators Be
headed, and the Viceroy Pre
vents a Demonstration in' the
Central Yangtse Valley.
PARIS, Aug. 27. â Official dispatches from Shanghai ex
plain that the Hankow uprising was not due to the Box
ers, but was a plot organized by the partisans of Kang Yu
Wei, the reformer, combined with the secret society known as
the "Ko Lao Hui," an anti-foreign organization, who proposed
to the southern Viceroys a revolt against the Peking Govern
ment. The leaders of the movement rely especially upon Chang
Chi Tung, Viceroy at Hankow, for arms, gunpowder and other
agents of destruction.
A- proclamation, written in English and addressed to Euro
peans, was seized. In it the revolutionists declared themselves
opposed to the Manchu dynasty, but ready to uphold the pres
ent Emperor. They expressed themselves as desirous of
founding a "constitutional government," of protecting foreigners
and Christians aruj of supporting the powers against anti-foreign
fanatics. Â±t-j-
The immediate effect on the Government has been to in
crease the peril of Europeans. Proof exists of disorder and pil
lage, due to the same movement, at widely separated points.
The headquarters of the conspiracy is Hankow, from which point
it ramified into other provinces.
Several thousands of the supporters of the movement have
received instructions to demonstrate in the central valley of the
Yangtsekiang, but the Viceroy has a sufficient force of regular
troops to guarantee the maintenance of order.
Twelve of the conspirators have been beheaded.
PARIS, Aug. 28. â The Siecle publishes this morning the following from itsspecial correspondent:
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 26.â I send you under all reserve the following news, which is repeated here with persistence: The Government
has received a dispatch informing it that after a terrible battle inside the walls of Peking the allies retired, losing 1800 men, mostly Russians, the
Chinese occupy fortified positions, whence they are bombarding the allied forces with a very deadly fire.
SHANGHAI, Aug. 26. â Local mandarins received a telegram to-day from Paoting-Fu stating that the allied powers have taken the district
west of Peking. Li Hung Chang sent a telegram to-day to the Empress at Sian-Fu requesting her to arrest Prince Tuan of the army in order to

FROGS' LEGS.
The Best From Canada and the De-
mand Is Increasing Rapidly.
There is money in frog culture. What
is. more astonishing, competition hi the
business is not great and the market sup
ply of frogs' legs often does not equal the
demand. Jersey furnishes a small part
of the supply, but over there the indus
try is as a rule followed upon desultory
and primitive lines. Small boys and men
with nothing better to do hunt the wild
frog to his lair and beat th* swamps.
For a short time the catch is satisfactory
and then. Just when the frog hunters see
colossal fortunes looming up before them,
the frogs give out and the business col
lapses. <-\''p-
They do the- thing better in Canada and
Western New York. Tho finest frogs'
legs in the market come from the Do
minion, and up there frog culture Is a
deeply serious and scientific affair, and
its profits are surprisingly large. The
Canadian frogs' legs are much larger
than any others and are always in great
demand in New York; but comparatively
few of them are to be. found in market
now, although the season for them has
been on for several months. The Cana
dian frog raisers are holding hack their
supply until July, when the opening of
the summer hotels increases the demand
tremendously and sends the prices sky
ward, v -v Â¦-Â¦Â¦: â¢. -v
The wholeale dealers charge from 30 to
60 cents a pound for the legs, the hind
quarters of about four frogs making a
pound. At the uptown retail dealers' one
pays from 50 to 75 cents and even $1
while at times, even during the season
the legs cannot be procured at any, price
The demand for the delicacy has alwavs
been fair, but it has steadily increase'd
and the prejudice against frog-eatini*
that once was strong among American*
has practically disappeared save in coun
try districts.
"Our: orders for frogs' legs are fifty
times as numerous as they were ten yeans
ago," said the head waiter of a Broad
way restaurant, when asked about thÂ»
matter. "You Americans have such nue->r
prejudices about what you eat. If yo'u
can swallow sof tshell crabs and -alters
and eels and pata. dc foie gras what's th"
sense in drawing the line at frogs? You'll

Just at ths moment the Sultan of Morocco
need not be alarmed at the appearance ox
an American man-of-war in the harbor oi
Tangier. '
Officials of the State and Navy Depart
ments say that the report published this
morning that an American warship had
put in at Tangier for the purpose of com
pelling Morocco to pay an indemnity for
injuries sustained by an American citizen
probably had its origin in a guilty con
science.
An American raturalized citizen named
Marcu? A. Zauui was murdered two
months ago by a mob in the town of
Fez. The crime was immediately reported
to the Ststp IÂ»< partment by Mr. Gum
mere, Consul General at Tangier, and he
was instructed by cable to request the
French Consul at P>z to make an investi
gation. The report of the French Consul
has not yet bi?on received, but Mr. Gum

Xo report of the arrival of an American

The itinerary of this vessel calls for her
arrival at Tangier on August 24 and her

Preclar Dispatch to The Call.
5VN FRANCISCO is domiciling an
accre.dlted representative of the de
posed Emperor of China, Kwang Su,
in tho. person of Leong Kal Tinn,
who is traveling through the civilized
world for the purpose of securing the nec
essary power to restore the Emperor to
his throne. The Emperor's representative
arrived in this city yesterday afternoon
and is staying at the Occidental. He is
a delicate and highly intellectual man in
appearance and travels in European attire,
accompanied by a secretary and a promi
nent Chinese, who represent the Mongo
lians on this coast who are in sympathy
with the cause which Leong Kai Tinn is
advocating. S
The mission of Leongf Kai Tinn to this
country is to enlist the Chinese ot the
United States in the effort to restore the
deposed monarch to his throne, to the end
that modern civilization may be intro
duced into China. Leong Kai Tinn speaks
no English, but through an interpreter he
said:
"I am In this country seeking the Bup
port of my countrymen to restore the Em
peror, Kwang Su, to tho throne from
which he was deposed , at the behest of
the Dowager Empress, because he was an
advocate of progress and of the abandon
ing of the Chinese customs and methods
for those of the modern "Western civiliza,
tion. My labors are purely in the line of
patriotism which looks to the best inter
ests of my country
"My mission thus far has been highly
successful and I look for satisfactory re
sults in the near future. I am tho ac
credited representative I of the Emperor
and my field is the entire civilized world.
Wherever there are countrymen of mine
in any considerable number there will I
be found eventually to advocate the cause
of my Prince, whose motto is advance
ment. I also represent the Chinese Em
pire Association of Reformers, whose
headquarters are at Macao. China. I am
establishing agencies throughout the
world for the promotion of the movement
j and wherever I go I deliver addresses on
the subject which is so dear to my -heart.
"In this city we have an organization of
5000, and I expect to double it before we
leave. There are branches in all the prin
cipal cltle3 of the coast and the North
western cities of this country, and before
I leave the United States there will be an
organization in every city. It is not known
in this country that .the organization 1
am promoting extends into tho interior of
China, and into the heart -. of the Boxer
country. Prior to this movement I -was
principal professor of the college in Yoko-i
hama established by the reformers. My

"I consider that this is the only move
ment that can r save China, and . if tht
Western powers -will recognize it and re

all will be'.well. If they will take cogniz
ance of the fact that tho fifteen provinces
of Southern China are fully in accord with
this movement, in fact, that 200,000.000 ot
the population of China are reformers,
they will have no hesitation in placng the
â¢ deposed Emperor on the throne. His res
toration to power will mean the advance

pression of the Boxers."

shows that the sum of $3979 75, money de
rived from the sale of produce, has not
been turned over to the State, and I un
derstand that Lang does not dispute the
assertion. Most ot the money. I under

During a Lively Battle Two Men Are Killed and

GILMAX. 111., Aug. 27.â Two men
killed, three woundedâ two of them
perhaps fatally; one woman
wounded and her residence burned,
are the results of an all-nfght bat
tle between a mob and Mrs. Dr. C. W.
Wright, who was accused of the murder
of Bessie Salter, the 16-yf-ai-old daughter
of a citizen of Gilman. The dead:
JOHN MYERS, laborer, employed by
Mrs. Dr. Wright.
MICHAEL RYAN; deputy constable.
Fatally wounded:
Lawrence Ryan, brother of the dead
man, wounded in abdomen.
George Willoughby, citizen, shot through
left lunff.
Mrs. Dr. C. W. Wright, shot through
right shoulder, bullet taking downward
course.
Seriously wounded: Pettr Hauer, mem
ber of citizens' attacking party, shot
through stomach.
Mrs. Dr. Wright is about 50 years old.
It is stated that she was formerly an
actress. For some time she lias been con
ducting a lying-in hospital on the out
skirts of Gilman.
First Act of the Tragedy.
About 10 o'clock In the evening the first
act of the tragedy occurred. It was pre
cipitated by the Investigation of the Cor
oner's jury into the death of Bessie Sal
ter, a 16-year-old girl of Leonard. III., who
died in the hospital Friday night and was
taken to her home "in Leonard under cover
cif darkness early Saturday morning. No
coffin was procured. She was wrapped
up in an old blanket and a piece of car
pet and buried.
After the jury had heard the evidence
of Clarence Salter, father of the girl, the
Coroner came to the conclusion that it
was injudicious to wait longer for I.Irs.
Wright's arrest, and a warrant was sworn
out by the Police Magistrate for her.
Constable Nilstead, with a posse, went to
the house to serve the warrant about 10
o'clock last night. MnÂ«. Wright barred
the entrance. The constable broke tho
outer door open and entered the darkened
room.
Michael Ryan v.as about to enter the
door of the inner apartment; v.iien a shot
rang out and he .fell dead. The Constables
then made a hurr!ert exit and formed a
picket line around 1 the building.- They
fired into the building in the hope that
the occupants would surrender, but with
out success.
Finally u was determined to set fire to
tho building, but recent rains had so
dampened its timbers that the fire would
not catch and alter burning some out-,
buildings, the posse gave up the attempt
and fell back to their original programme
of driving out Mrs. Wright.
House Sat on Fire.
About 3 o'clock the family of Michael
Ryan arrived. A mob of probably -3d peo
ple had gathered. Most 61 them were
armed. Tho scenes of grier which fol
lowed the arrival of Ryan's wife and chil
dren tired the crowd with frenzy. They
seized dozens of bundles of straw, satur
ated them with petroleum, piled thrni
against the front and sides of the so-c;.llej
hospital and applied the torch. In a mo
ment, the place was a mass of fUirr!^.
Shot after shot rar.g from the upper i
windows; and George Willoughhy, a local
representative of the Standard Oil Com
pany, fell with a bullet in the left side.
The next victim was Peter Hauer, a
member of the attacking party. These
casualties so angered the crowd that they
volleyed tho house as fast as they could
load and fire arms.
Contrary to expectations, no screams
followed the progress of the flames, and
the mob began to think that the inmate*
of the burning house had been cremated.
Suddenly, from a bunch of timber in the
rear, several shots came In the direction
of tho mob. They were, however, a hun
dred to one, and the fire was quickly si
lenced. Members of the mob rushed to
the timber, and In the dim light of the
coming dawn found the body of John My
ers, a blacksmith, who had been employed
by Mrs. Wright, stretched out in the death
agony. He was shot in a dozen places
about the head and shoulders, showing
that he had been lying on his face ilring
at his enemies when ho met his death.
Woman Again Threatened.
Near by iay Mrs. \\ right, with a ragged
hole in her .shoulder. The mob immedi
atrly dispersed.
It had been reported that there were
three women in the house besides Mrs.
Wright, hut they were not found. The
! house was destroved with its contents.
I â¢ Mrs. Wright was taken to the City Ila'l
and a strong guard placed over her. A
crowd assembled and threats of Ivnchin?
were uttered. Every effort was mail? to
quiet and disperse the mob. but at 9::i0
o'clock this forenoon the crowd made an
other demonstration, smashing the win
t dows with stones and clubs. This culmi
| Bated in a shot being fired through a win
j now by one of the mob, barely missing
the woman.
Verdicts at the Inquest. '
At the Coroner's inquest to-day in- the
case of John Myers the jury brought in a
verdict of "death by bullet wounds from
parties unknown."
In the case of Michael Ryan the ver
j diet of the jury was "death by leader,
bullets fired from Mrs. Wright's house by
parties unknown."
The inauest over tho body of Bessie
Kalter was completed this evening. The.
jury held Mrs. Wright to the Grand Jury
without bail.
Mrs. Wright was taken to Watseka this
noon as a measure of precaution from
possible mob violence. During the morn
ing, when she seemed in great dangt-r
| from the crowd, the Mayor ordered the
paloons closed. The town is quiet to-
I night.

that a sale of randy property valued at
$5000, made under foreclosure to' the Pa
cific Mutual Life Insurance Company of
San Francisco, is invalid, and that the
title i3 vested in himself. The sale was
made in 1S35. The corporation sold the
property to Philip Brewer, who now has
possession. Boyer contends that he has
acquired title through purchase from one
of the defendants to the foreclosure suit,
who was never legally deprived of owner
ship. The question involved Is whether a
defendant can be served with summons

summons has been -made to the court.

COAST NEWS IN BRIEF.
i Land Commissioner Hermann, who Is on
his way from the East to Oregon, told the
Chamber of Commerce to-day what his
office is doing toward guarding the forest
reserves In this section and he was shown,
while on the way to and coming from
Mount Lowe, the effects 'of the fire now
raging and the one which recently de
vastated Santa Anita Canyon. The Com
missioner promises to those in charge here
all the assistance needed for the fighting
of fires at any and all times. Orders have
befn given that no expense must be
spared in the matter.
Yesterday the telephone line to Sturte
vants Camp was completed and a mes
sage from there was received by Commis
sioner Border, requesting him to send
fifteen more men to assist in guarding
the east line of the fire and prevent it
from spreading in that direction. Al
though he had some difficulty in securing
men, Mr. Border was able to send a num
ber of men and will have more on the way
to-morrow morning. The force will then
number about eighty. It was reported
from Sturtevants Camp tjiat the fire has
spread on the north side of the west fork
of the San Gabriel River and the south
side of ' the Tcjunga River, between
Devils' Canyon -and Short Cut. A fire
break is being made to the west and north
of the fire line and it ia believed that the
progress of the flames will there receive a
decided check. The area of fore3t al
ready destroyed is estimated at from five
to ten square miles. Pine Flats has
not yet been reached and the rangers
think that the fire will be prevented from
going that far.

REDDING, Aug. 27. â A curious phenomeno'n of nature is in evidence at the farm of
William Hobbs in the Sands Flat country. Following an unaccounted for explosion
in a well on that place, the water has become black as ink and is churning and boiling
uncannily, like the fabled witches' caldron.
The Hobbs home is about six miles northeast of Redding. Unlike the majority of
the wells in that region, the one on the Hobbs place has contained good water. Thursday
night the members of the Hobbs family heard a terrific explosion. The windows rattled and
articles in the house were knocked over. All the members of the family were awakened by
the shock and they were puzzled to account for the unusual noise. Then the head of the
household went out to investigate. From the direction of the well he heard a hissing, bub
bling noise. Further investigation showed the water in the well to be foaming and churning.
Spray was flying high in the air. The family was nonplused and decidedly" uncomfortable,
not knowing what might happen next.
When daylight came they saw that instead of the sparkling, crystal fluid, the water was
black as ink. It tasted of salt and oil and felt greasy. The odor of gas about the well was
strong. The water does not rise in the well, although it continues to boil and remains black
and of a bad taste.
Sunday night F. Dobrowsky, a reputable Redding jeweler, visited the place and saw the
wonderful well. He said he experienced an uncomfortable sensation in looking down on the
churning mass. . The mystery connected with it seems uncanny. The well is in a region
that has every sign of harboring oil. The general opinion concerning the action of the Hobbs
well is that it is caused by gas escaping through the water from the depths below.

SAX DIEGO, Aug. 27.â J. C. Needham
was renominated by acclamation for Con
gress at the Republican Congressional
Convention of the Seventh California Dis
trict at Coronado Beach to-day. No other
candidate was presented. A resolution
pledging: the candidate to work for the
completion of the necessary improvements
of San Diego harbor and indorsing the ad
ministration of President McKinley was
adeptefl unanimously. Following is a por
tion of the resolutions adopted:
The Rejjublican party of the Seventh Con
greEEional District of California by its repre
sentatives In convention assembled at Coro
nado Beach on this, Â¦ the 27th day of August,
1800. hereby pledges itself to the principles and
policies set forth in the platform adopted by
the Xational Republican Convention on July
19 at the city of Philadelphia.
V>'e congratulate ourselves upon being rep
resented in the present CongTess by the Hon.
J. C. Needham. whose course during his first
term in national affairs has reflected credit
upon himself and his constituents, and whose
untiring industry and efforts have resulted in
favorable local legislation of vast Importance
to his district, and we believe the material in
terest of this district demand his return to
ConsTess.
The , importance of San Diego harbor, by
rfifiÂ«on of its geographical location and Its
I rapidly Browing commerce, as well as being a
j strong Ftrategric point, renders the Improvement
' of said harbor of the utmost importance, both
I from a local as well as a national standpoint,
and we therefore demand of Congress a suf
ficient appropriation to complete *he jetty in
accordance with, the plans therefor designed
and adopted by the War Department, and a
sufficient appropriation to dredge the bar Â¦ to
a depth of thirty feet at low tide, and such
an amount as may be necessary to straighten
the channel at the harbor entrance; and as a
river and harbor bill will be presented at the
next meeting of Congress In December, we.
pledge the nominee of this convention to use
i his utmost efforts in obtaining recognition of
i this demand by embodying the necessary pro
visions in said bill.
The large amount of arid lands in this as
well as other Western States renders it im
' portant and desirable that the Xational Gov
ernment should adopt such measures as will
conserve the flood waters for use in aid of
irrigation of eaid lands, thus opening up a vast
territory for settlement and development of
i natural resources.
i The horticultural Interest of this department
; Is ono of the chief industries of our people and
we pledge the nominee of this .convention to
unalterably oppose any measure which would
result In lessening the protection now afforded
the horticulturists tinder the tariff blll'enacted
by the present Republican administration.

, â¢
SEATTLE. Wash.. Aug. 27.â The oppo
sition forces In this State to the Repub
lican party are holding their convention
In this city. They went into session at
2 o'clock and did not adjourn except for
a short period until late to-night. The
Populists are' holding their convention In
Gertnania Hall, the Democrats in the
Armory and the silver Republicans In
Masonic Hall. The convention will be In
session to-morrow and may not adjourn
sine die until Wednesday or Thursday.
The most significant development to-day
lies In the apparent defeat of the Rogers
slate, which carries with it Governor Rog
ers as the fusion nominee for the office
he now occupies. The Populists have de
clared from the start that they would
not stand for Rogers. The leaders of the
party had held a number of anti-Rogers
caucuses and felt satisfied that their
party would be against Rogers first, last
and all the time. They figured correctly,
for when the Por>ulist Convention met.
State Land Commissioner Bridges was
elected chairman by a good majority.
Bridges is bitter in his opposition to the
Governor and in all his rulings favored
the anti-Rogers' element. He was author
ized to name the committee of five to con
fer with like committees from the other
conventions. Each man he named is
against Rogers. The Populists went so
far as to declare outside of the convention
hall that they would not confer with the
other committees unless the latter agreed
to eliminate Rogers from the race.
The Rogers men in the DemoeraticCon
vention were fully aware of the Populist
opposition to Rogers, but declared that
thev would nominate him on a straight
Democratic ticket and allow the Populists
to put an independent ticket in the field.
Tom Vance, Assistant Attorney General,
was made temporary chairman of the
Democratic Convention. Rogers and anti-
Rogers people united on him. The Rog
ers people have maintained for several
days that they would control the conven
tion by a good majority. To-night's ses
sion proved this claim to be without
basis of fact. Senator George Turner was
nominated by them for permanent chair
man. Charles G. Helfner was nominated
by the anti-Rogers people and was elected
by a majority of five or six. The anti-
Rogers people say the vote was a true test
of strength and Rogers, it would seem to

Fawcett of Pierce County or Voorhees
of Spokane is likely to be nominated, al
though there is opposition to both and the

THE CONVENIIQN BEGINS TO-DAY
SANTA ROSA. Aug. 27.â A number of
Indians engaged in a fight near the Cali
fornia Northwestern Railway depot to
day, with the result that at least one red
man was seriously, perhaps fatally, stab
bed, and a sauaw was. terribly beaten.
The Indians secured a quantity of liquor
and after consuming It began a free fight.
The two leading belligerents were the
Carillo brothers, who figured in a stab
bing affray here a few weeks ago. Ono
of them knocked his brother insensible
with a coupling pin and then had to de
fend himself against a combined attack
from the other Indians. The squaw en
deavored to assist him and received ter
rible blows about the head. CarUlo re
ceived several ugly knife thrusts and sank
to the ground. ,
When the cfn"cers reached the scene
they found the woman half dead, cower
ing under a shed. She was with difficulty
induced to come out, and begged plteous
ly to be locked up. fearing further vio
lence from the Indians if she wero not
protected. The officers lodged her in th<Â»
County Jail, where her injuries Wfre at
tended to. The police are now hunting
for the other participants In the fight.

SAX JOSE. Aug. 2T.-One of the most
bastardly crimes in the category, result
ing in the death of a mother, when she
earned knowledge of her daughters fate,
was perpetrated on little Grace Gamble.
a 11-year-old girl. In the eastern suburbs
of the city last night.
James M. Gamble, who conducts a brick
yard, and resides on Senter road, opposite
Phelan avenue, and family attended serv
ice at the United Presbyterian Church,
corner of Fifth and Santa Clara streets,
last night. Mr. and Mrs. Gamble went
xiome by streetcar, but the childrenâ
Grace and her two brothers. Wilbur and
Elroy, aged 17 and 14 respectivelyâstart
ed to walk, cs they wished to visit an
older brother living on South Eighth
street. They spent a short time at tneir
brother's, leaving there about 10 '.'clock.
Tha boys agTeed to take a cow home with
them. At Ninth and Margaret streets
Grace ran aiiead across the lots and came
out on Keyts and Eleventh streets. A
young man passing in a buggy hailed her,
calling her by the name of Laura. She
caid she was not the person addressed.
Ke then told her to get in the buggy and
lie would take her home. The pin inno
cently complied. Her brothers nad seen
her get in a bupgy and hastened toward
"her, but the man whipped h;s horse and
etarte-d before they were in hailing dis
tance.
As the bugg^ came to the girl's house
The stranger refused to let her out. Mrs.
Gamble was standing at the gats waiting
for. the children. The girl screamed. This
note of alarm conveyed to the mother the
danger her daughter was in. and she im
mediately went into hysterics. The boys
coon rushed home, and Wilbur mounted

He was in a top buggy, drawn by a dark

HARRY CORSON CLARKE, the
dyspeptic actor who once upon a
time insisted that Frawley and
Blanche Bates were married, has
contracted the molasses candy habit un
til he has become the sweetest tempered
man in the business..
Clarke took to the molasses candy habit
some few months ago while an inmate of
a Chicago hospital. He was taking the
milk diet as a cure for trouble,
and while tossing his eighty-six pounds of
wretched humanity on his bed of agony
his eyes turned in the direction of a
neighboring cot, where a small boy was
munching some molasses candy. Clarke
watched the boy, with eager, hungry eyes.
Then he thought' of the milk that . was
about to be brought to him, and gathering
up his courage, asked for a piece of thi:
sticky stuff. The small boy gave it. Cor
son ate and from that moment hla health
began to Improve. In less than a month
afterward the actor was discharged from
the hospital/completely cured. He claims
that the molasses camly did it. Â¦Â¦Â¦'_:Â¦
There "is only one unfortunate- incident
connected with Clarke's cure and that is
that. the actor has an aggravated case of
molasses candy habit. He won't eat any-
â¢'I am doing all I can to control my
passion for molasses candy. It saved mv
life,' but I' am told I will die by it ir-"l
am not careful. If I ate all I wanted of
it I might grow to he as heavy again as
I am, and I now weigh 13S pounds. Â¦
"I don't believe molasses candy will ruin
my Â¦ stomach, which - It has benefited so
much., 1 am glad to make my experience
public; it will make the way easier for
any sufferer." . ..
Then^ there are others who tell of a
molasses candy jag, but Clarke declares
there Is not one word of truth in it and
that what his friends mistook for a jag
was simply a case of well-earned molasses
candy indigestion. Clarke's strange case
is attracting" the attention of New York
ers and with the hope that suffering hu
manity may benefit . by means of the
strangecuro. Clarke yesterday gave out
the following statement to the New York
press for publication.

breakfast, lunch and dinner and nibbles
at It between meals. His Intimate friends

We thrill at the story of "Curfew
shall not ring to-night." Yet it is
melodramatic and commonplace be-
side the peril every woman runs who
faces motherhood. Women are
strangely self-forgetful. The ex-
altation of the fact of motherhood
blinds them often to its peril. Yet
the husband who can bear no tithe
of the mother's pain or peril owes it
to himself to see that his wife is in
that condition of sound health which
minimizes the risk both to mother
and child. Many husbands have
expressed their gratitude for Dr.
Pierce's Favorite Prescription, be-
cause, it makes the pain of mother-
hood practically nothing and reduces
the risk to its lowest possible point.

AT HAWTHORNE
DETROIT, Aug. 27.â Major General
James R. Carnahan assumed formaJ com
mand of the tenth biennial encampment
"of the Uniform Rank, Knights of Pythias,
at 5:30 o'clock this evening in the presence
of the several divisions of his command
and a throng of spectators. The various
brigades and separate regiments in camp
were drawn up for the ceremony in dress
parade formation on the boulevard facing
the major general's headquarters, the
Held officers at the front rank. The men
stood, however, in closer order than Is
common in dress parades.
General Carnahan was stationed at the
edge of the rise of ground on -which his
headquarters is located, his numerous
staff ranged along on either side. Most
of the spectators were massed along the
embankment on the opposite side of the
boulevard in the rear of rows of red
plumed white helmets of the knights. The
ceremonies began with an address of wel
come by Mayor Maybury. The Mayor as
sured the knights that if any of them
should be in need of a hostage he him
self would cheerfully act as such. Mayor
Maybury congratulated the knights upon
the fact that knighthood and the drawn
sword now signified not war, but kindliest
purposes, courtesy, honor, gallantry and
gentleness. Â¦ , .
Grand Chancellor Lusk, in the absence
of Governor Pingree. presented a welcome
on behalf of the State, and Dr. R. L. Cun
ningham, chairman of the local Pythian
committee, did likewise. Supreme Chan
cellor Sample and General Carnahan re
sponded. , .
Following the speeches a large Ameri
can flag was hoisted on the headquarters
flagstaff and cannon boomed out salutes,
field officers rejoined their commands, and
all marched to quarters to the confusing
sounds of several brass bands.
The principal formal events to-night
were receptions in the Masonic Temple
held by the supreme representatives and
officers of the Rathbone and Pythian sis
ters The down town illuminations shone
over a great throng of Pythian visitors
and ladles. .,. . ,
Sessions of the supreme lodge -will begin
to-morrow. One of the most actively dis
cussed questions is the candidacy of Su
preme Chancellor Sample for re-election.
A very strong sentiment is developing to
continue the custom of rotation in office
and elect Vice Chancellor Fethers of \\ is
consin chief officer. The spectacular
feature of to-morrow will be the grand
parade.
Candidacy of Supreme Chancellor
Sample Is Being Discussed and

PROMISE OF SPLENDID SPORT
AT THE SACRAMENTO FAIR
NEW" YORK. Aug. 27.â The light be
tween Tommy West and Joe Wal
cott, which was the main attrac
tion at the Twentieth Century Club
In Madison Square Garden, ended in
a most peculiar manner to-night. The
bout had gone eleven rounds very much
in Walcott's favor, as he punished West
badly about the body and had him in a
very weakened condition. When the bell
rang for the twelfth round, to the surprise
of everybody. Walcott refused to go on,
claiming that he had Injured his left arm.
Referee Charley White. suspecting
crookedness, insisted on Walcott's contin
uing, but the negro refused to do so.
which left White no alternative other than
to declare West the winner. There was
quite a large sum of money wagered, with
West the favorite, and the referee was
outspoken in reference to ..alcott's pecu
liar actions.
White said: "Walcott was not Injured.
He quit deliberately, and it was my can
did, confirmed opinion that he was actu
ated in quitting by some dishonest motive.
I believe Walcott was encouraged to act
Kid McFadden of San Francisco and
Jimmy Rose of this city met in the pre
liminary bout at 115 pounds. They were
to have fought twelve rounds, but thÂ»
Xew Yorker was forced to quit In thtÂ»
eleventh round, after McFadden hai
planted a right over his heart. The early
rounds were full of fast work.
as he did by some persons closely con
nected with him. That he should act thus
is no surprise to me. as he established *
precedent for similar work in San Fran
cisco "not so very long ago. And I thinK
it was a scheme to nurt the management
of the Twentieth Century Club, which has
all along acted in good faith."
Manager Kennedy, on behalf of the club,
announced that Walcott's share or the
money would not be given to him. but
would be donated to some charitable in
stitution. There were many anxious in
quiries as to whether the bets made woulrt
be declared off. but Manager Kennedy, on
behalf of th<Â» club, said that as betting In
New York State was illegal he was sorrv
that the club could take no cognizance o?
wagers made. Otherwise all persons con
nected with the club would be glad to call
all bets off.

WALCOTT GIVES UP IN
THE ELEVENTH ROUND
NETS' YOrUC, Aug. r?.â Robert Fitz-
Eimmons to-day announced his re
tiroment from the pugilistic ring.
He made an ineffectual attempt to
day to get on a match for the
leavy-weigtot championship with James J.
jeffries, to take p'.are before the Horton
aw expires, at midnight next Friday, and
o-night Issued the following statement:
"I am through with fightir.g. I will re
ire from the ring and will not claim the
from Jvffries. I am ready
ind on edge to meet Friday night, as his
nanajrer s*u sprouted ten days ago. but as
it> claims he is in no condition to fight on
:hat night I am through with him and
hf ring. Henceforth there will be one.
Â¦nan less; in the heavy-weight division, for
! will go out w:'th the Horton law."
Kitz.simmor.s with his manager, Percy
Williams, met William A. Brady, repre
senting Jeffries, this afternoon. Last
?ati;rday Fitzsimmons deposited $2500 to
>frsd a match between himself and Jeffries
'or next FTiday night, and Urady sont
irord that he would mret r'ilzpimmons to
irran?* 1 for a battle between Jeffries and
be ex-beav y-m*Aght champion. Fitzsim
Â¦nor.s tajd he was ready and willing to
meet Jeffries on Friday night before the
Twentieth Century Club under any condi
tions as to the division of the purse or
gate receipts which would suit Brady.
He said he would be satisfied for the
winner to take all. to split the purse in
half oivto give â¬5 per cent to the winner
or Co per cent to the loser, or. in fact, any
terms possible eo that he could meet thb
present champicn before the expiration of
the Horton law. Brady in reply said that
Jeffries was in no condition, as he had
quit training several days ago. It would
be unfair to force a match with a man
physically unfit for such a contest.
Fitzsimmons replied that Jeffries had
had plenty of time to get into condition,
and said that although he had gone
through two very severe battles during
the last two weeks he was on edge and
ready to fight to regain the championship.
Brady said it was impossible for a fight
to take place between Jeffries and Fitz
simmons on the date mentioned, but that
he would put up a forfeit at once to bind
a match between the two. the fight to
take place within three months from Sep
tember 1. and a. side bet of JIO.OOO. Fitz
siir.rr.ons would not listen to this proposi
tion, and said that it was only made for
advertising purposes.
Unable to Make Satisfactory Terms With
Jeffries, the Australian Announces
He Has Fought His Last Fight.

The local committee, through Mr.

CHICAGO, Aug. 27.â 'W. J. Bryan has
followed the example of President McKIn

message to Executive Director "W. M.

BRYAN DECLINES TO
ATTEND THE ENCAMPMENT
Short addresses were mado by Senator
Davis of Minnesota, General John C.
Black and others. _
See to It that the best Inspirations of right
eousness are always pressed and kept a*, the
front In all our Union and that our text books
are national In their scope. Just and worthy
in their character and equal to all the noble
possibilities of a sacred citizenship based upon
a common ilove of our enduring liberties.
Our future will be safe and strong just fo
long as our youth are worthy and wise. WhÂ«n
these weaken or fall all will be lost. It Is for
the sons of veterans to lead the way in the
teaching of lofty Ideals of patriotism in all
the circles of our. youth, and so lay deep and
broad the lasting foundations of Justice, con
cord end religion â three pillars of the temple
of national fame of unrivaled national safety
and glory.
music, vocal and Instrumental, made
memorable the annual meeting of the I
Cook County Sons of Veterans, which was
held in Memorial Hall to-night. The beau
tifully decorated auditorium waa packed
to the doors and the distinguished speak
ers were enthusiastically greeted. Com
mander In Chief Albert D. Shaw of tho
Grand Army of tho Republic delivered the
principal speech of the evening. He spoke
in part as follows:
The ace In which our lot is â¢ cast Is without
a parallel In the past and the opportunities for
working for good and for God along satisfy
ing lines of endeavor are greater than they
ever have been before. The veterans of the
'COs have mainly done their work and their
record during the great war will be Imperish
able. A country free, a Union Indissoluble, a
Stars and Stripes beloved and honored by all
our people, a common heritage of a Christian
civilization, and a republic first In the fore
most llsht of Individual rights and broad jus
tice, are the immutable foundations of our
matchless nation. And as the shadows lengthen
as they face the setting sun of life the veter
ans look with admiring pride upon their sons
as tholr successors in large measure in all
that insures lofty views of love of country and
safe'ambitions to preserve the American Union
in all Its noblest possibilities of a wise and
commanding civilization and the true glory of
Almighty God. Not all the heroes are to be
found on the battlefield of war, for In peace
there Is a demand for the most stalwart "bra
very and the most uncompromising valor.
War often opens up the way for the exercise
of the noblest qualities of young manhood in
composing the irritations that have deluged
the land in blood. In our day we see this
view exemplified, as the former two great sec
tions of our Union have become united In a
common bend of happy citizenship through
the commingling influences of a common love
of justice and of liberty. .
The horrid hell of war has been superseded
by the sweet blessings'- of peace and to-night
the Sons of Veterans who marched amid the
sacrifice of sorrow's nlcht of blood and agony
mr-et in peace and >joy happy in their en
vironments of citizenship and peerless in their
girth and grain as ardent young Americans.
Discussed the Race Question.
INDIANAPOLIS. Aug. 27.â The Na
tional Afro-American Press Association
to-day opened with over fifty delegates i;i
attendance. A discussion of the race
question occupied the whole day. At the
night session a resolution to Indorse the
administration of President McKlnley waa
voted down, after a hot discussion.
SONS OF VETERANS MEET.
CHICAGO, Aug. 27.â Eloquent speeches
by soldiers and statesmen and patriotic
It is expected that the elevation of Ma
jor Leo Rassieur of St." Louis as com
mander In chief will be unanimous, there,
being no other candidate.
Several persons were injured in the
crowded streets during the day and one
aged veteran. Rov. Norman G. Whitney,
of Gray Eagle. Minn., was killed by being
trampled upon by a runaway horse.
A meeting of the National Association
of ex-Prisoners of War was held in the
Coliseum to-niEht, which drew a large
crowd an attractive programme being
rendered. The address of welcome was
delivered by Mayor Harrison. Speeches
were also made by Governor [ Stone or
Pennsylvania. Senator Penrose of Penn
sylvania and General J. C. Black of Chi
cago.
While the old prisoners of war were re
newing old friendships at the Coliseum
and the survivors of the Iron Brigade
were holding forth at the athletic club
the naval veterans, who had been given
the honors of the day. were having a dog
watch of their own in the auditorium of
the Toung Men's Christian Association
building. J "f; ' 'â;
A reunion of the veterans by States will
be held to-morrow, this being a feature
of the encampment which has never been
attempted before. There will be twenty-
Blx of these State reunions. Â¦*&,
The programme to-morrow Includes the
creat parade of the Grand Army, which
is expected to be the largest parade evei
held by the organization since it came into
existence. Fully 40,000 men, all members
of the Grand Army, will be in line, ac
cording to the statement of the officials
in charpe of the preliminary arrange
ments and it Is estimated that It will re
quire over four hours for the line of
march to pass a given point.
President McKinley. if he could have
come to the encampment, would have
been the center of attraction at the head
of the parade, and a pageant of patriotism
had been arranged to accompany him In
the form of guards of honor, battlenags
and heralds.
The contest for the honor of entertain
ing the next annual eneamnment of the
G A. R. promises to be a very lively one.
The preponderance of sentiment apparent
ly favors a Western city, and both Salt
I^ake and Denver have delegations on the
ground working hard to secure the en
campment of 190L In the contest this year
something besides geographical >eonsid
erations is apparently having much
weight with the veterans. The passage
of the years has made it much more dif
ficult to bear the fatigue of a march un
der the blazing sun than it was In the
â¢CO'"?, and many of .the most prominent
members of the organization are vpro
nounred In favor of the selection of a city
for the next encampment where reason
ably cool weather may be expected. This
sentiment will undoubtedly have much to
do with the selection, and It is considered
not unlikely that the next annual encamp
ment may be held west of the Mississippi
River. "Commander in Chief Shaw is
quoted as favoring "any place where they
mnv have cool weather."
Beunion of Ex-Prisoners.
Fessenden and a fleet of excursion steam- i
ers it had been planned to have the large
fleet of tiie Chicago Yacht Club included
in the parade from the lake front park,
off Jackson boulevard to Lake Michigan,
where the naval battle took place, but
the breeze cf tho morning died away and
hardly a breath of air was stirring dur
ing the afternoon, so that part of the pro
gramme waa necessarily abandoned. The
i;overnment vessels, towing a string of
barges filled with detachments from tho
Illinois naval reserve and gayly decorated
with Hags and streamers, and the excur
sion boats, loaded with sightseers, made
an imposing appearance as they slowly
et^amed out of the harbor and headed to
ward Lincoln Park. The fleet arrived qff
Lincoln Park about 4:30 p. m. and then,
in sight of tens of thousands of spectators
gathered along the seawall of the pan<,
the revenue cutters, with their blue jack
eted crews working the rapid-fire guns of
the two vessels, went through some beau
tiful maneuvering in a sham fight.
The evolutions exemplifying the work
ings of two fighting ships in battle lasted
lor half an hour and at their conclusion
the fleet slowly steamed back to the nar
'rhe end of the naval fight off Lincoln
Park closed the official programme of the
encampment for the day. but all over the
city in various halls and in all the hotels
there were reunions of regiments almost
without number and fraternal greetings
Â°One olithe leading affairs of the night
was the banquet of the Iron Brigade,
which was held at the clubhouse of the
Chicago Athletic Club at 6:30. The speak
ers were Speaker Henderson, Senator Bur

CHICAGO, Aug. 27.â At a meeting of the
People's party national committee to-day
the declination of Charles A. Towne aa
the Vice Presidential nominee of the par,ty
was accepted, and the name of Adlai K.
Stevenson was put in his place. This re
sult was obtained after a long debate, be
einnine at 2 p. m. and ending about 6:30
p m In the" beginning there were three
courses * advocated by different members
POPULISTS SUBSTITUTE
STEVENSON FOR TOWNE
But the x statement that we never promised
the Ftliplnos their Independence conveys a
false Impression. Our conduct was such as to
estop nn honorable nation from using such a
plea as a Justification or as excuse for at
tempting to subjugate the Islands.
The Filipinos made no secret of their object
In rebelling- against the Spanish Government.
What thev desired to do was to form a gov
ernment of their own and to be absolutely Inde
pendent of Spain. The representatives of the
United States tn the East knew this object
perfectly well. The Filipinos proclaimed It to
the world.
It is Important to bear In mind that the
Filipino republic established under the leader
ship of Agulnaldo was a government In fact,
fecognized throughout the Island of Luzon and
everal adjoining islands to the south, capable
of preserving order, collecting taxes, maln
talnins education and a complete system of
public administration, raising and supporting
an army which for a considerable period
numbered 30,000 men, and conducting war ac
cording to . the humane principles of modern
international law.
- Mr. Towne denied that the Filipinos
were barbarians or unfit for self-govern
ment. He declared the idea of taking
forcible possession of the Islands -was not
decided upon until a considerable period
after the battle of Manila Bay, and mean
while the Filipino3 were permitted to hope
for independence. â¢ '
After describing the strained relations
between the Americans and the Filipinos,
after the capture of Manila, Mr. Towno
Our opponents are in the habit of referring
to the outbreak of actual hostilities between
us and the Filipinos as though the latter were
the aggressors, and much is attempted to be
made out of such expressions as "they fired
0n Bm. r o" a course. since we had secretly formed
a determination to seize the islands, it Is ap
parent that whenever that design became man
ifest or we attempted to put It into effect the
Filipinos, if they were earnest men declaring
their object to be independence, would resist
it The aggressor, regardless of who struck
the first blow, would be, not he who stood
in defense of a right, but he who by act or
throat compelled the other to defend It. The
dcvelopmrnt of the hostile design was Itself
Is. considering the tropical nature
of the islanders and the lonz-contlnued course
o' our mingled reticence, ambiguity and of
fense that they were not betrayed into vio
lence" Ions before any clash actually occurred.
As a matter of tad, however, as shown by
General Otis' official report, our troop*, flrea
the first shot and the Filipinos stood on the
defensive.
He then discussed the protocol and the
treaty of peace and the proclamation of
Janaury 3, 1S99. at Manila, which he de
clared was "of the very essence of
imperialism." Taking tip Governor Roose
velt's speech, he said:
It was enormously disappointing. Neither in
matter nor manner is it worthy of its occasion.
In respect of argument the speeoh is. with rare
exceptions, an alternation of evasion and as
sertion, in spirit it is a compound of scold
and scullloa As to Us facts it abounds in
Inaccuracies which, if accidental, are Inex
plicable aa coming from a man who has per
formed creditably In history and biography.
But the world Is accustomed to Inconsistencies
from Mr Roosevelt. It has long looked upon
him a? a predestined and incorrigible eccentric.
It has given up attempting to explain him or
to reconcile him with himself. It is quite lm-
Dosslble, whether It would be worth while or
otherwise or not. to make an entirely satlsfac
torv diagnosis of a civil service reformer in
partnership with Thomas C. Platt. a citizen-sol
dier who ridicules the volunteer, a leader In
battle who finds glory in being rescued from
ambush; a hero who boasts of shooting a fleeing
fof In the back; a candidate who plays and
poses to delegates and galleries to obtain a
nomination that he does not want: a gentleman
who charges six and a - half millions of his :
fellow-countrymen with lawlessness, dlshon
cVry and cowardice; a statesman who, mounted
on a hobby, rides roughly at -grave questions
in economics and politics swinging his partisan
lariat and yelling like an Intellectual Coman-
Cl Mr Towne then read quotations from
the St Paul speech of Governor Roose
velt which he said showed the truth of
what he had said of that speech as a
whole." He argued at considerable length
against any possible constitutional right
under which the United States could hold
and govern colonies, ridiculing the alleged
claim that this right was given by that
provision of the constitution which gives
Congress the power to make all needful
rules and regulations respecting the "ter
ritorv and other property of tho United
State*." ,
DULUTH, Minn.. Aug. 27.â The largest
gathering to listen to a political speech
that ever assembled In Duluth occurred
this evening at the Armory, when Hon.
Charles A. Towne opened the campaign
In a lengthy address, In which he replied
I to the recent speech of Governor Roose
velt delivered at St. Paul on the occasion
of the National convention of the League
of Republican Clubs, and arraigned the
administration's policy in the Philippines.
The audience, which comprised persons ,
of all shades oÂ£ political belief and many I
scores of women, listened attentively to
tho orator's remarks for more than two
hours, and frequently throughout the dis
j course tho applause was deafening.
I The speech, which will be used as a cam.
I paign document, is considered as Towne'a
greatest political effort. At its conclusion
he was tendered an ovation by the multi
tude present.
Mr Towne will leave to-morrow or on
Wednesday for Idaho and other Western
points to enter actively into the work of
the campaign.
Mr. Towne opened his speech by ex
pressing lack of patience with any one
who believed in his "party, right or
wrong," or "any President, right or
wrong," considering tho latter simply an
other statement of the divine right of
kings. He then said:
As a rule one subject oÂ£ interest Is uppermost
in the public mind and chiefly calls for dis
cussion and decision. This is especially true
In 1900. The relatively secondary matters im
portant as they are all have reference to poll
cirs to be pursued by the republic. The issue
of flrst moment, the one that temporarily
dwarfs all others by comparison, is whether
the republic itself is to continue. I shall de
vote the greater part of my time to-night to
the consideration of imperialism. Let us first
inquire how the question lias arisen. It is one
of the paradoxes \>l history that a policy of
subjugation and conquest should have been
the inheritance of a war of liberation.
He then reviewed at some length the
causes leading up to and tho chief events
of the Spanish war. He took up the insur
rection in the Philippines, sketching it
briefly and telling how brilliantly Dewey
and his sailors engaged the Spanish fleet
in Manila Bay, and continued:
It was thus as a mere incident in tho prose
cution of our war for the liberty of Cuba that
we found ourselves in the Philippine Islands.
It sb claimed that circumstances were such
as to compel us, with due regard to our Inter
ests and our International duties to pursue in
these Islands thereafter the policy for which
the administration has become responsible. A
brief examination, however, of those circum
stances will suffice to show that the policy
adopted was not only unnecessary, but that it
was in the highest degree disadvantageous to
the United States, while involving the utmo3t
cruelty and Injustice toward the Inhabitants
of those islands and violating every principle
of cood faith and the honorable traditions of
American diplomacy.
He said the coming of Aguinaldo was at
the invitation of Admiral Dewey and that
' he was to be an ally of the Americans,
, qCotlng from the naval records in sup
; port of his assertion.
After again referring to the different
5 ! situations in Cuba and the Philippines, he
- said:
Deals Chiefly "With tho Policy Pur
sued in the Philippines and
Takes a Fall Out of Roose
velt on the Side.
Opens the Campaign Before
a Large Gathering at
Duluth.

Besides the revenue cutters Morrell and
Preceding the naval parade, the big
naval arch, erected at Michigan avenue
and Hubbaxd court, near the John A. Lo
gan monument, and marking the south
end of the Court of Honor, was dedicated.
Although the exercises were held at a
comparatively early hour, an immense
crowd witnessed the ceremonies In honor
of the naval veterans.
The exercises were exceedingly simple.
Shortlv after 9 o'clock Major K. A. Bige
low. secretary of the Grand Army of the
Republic; Bishop Samuel Fallows and Dr.
E P. Murdock, past commander-in-chief
and member of Farragut Post, G. A. R.,
who had been selected to make the dedi
catory speech, left the G. A. R. headquar
ters at the Palmer House and, escorted by
Wilkinson Post No. 9 of New York, a de
tachment of the Illinois Association of
Naval Veterans and the Illinois First
Regiment Band, were driven down Michi
gan avenue to the big white arch, erected
in honor of the veterans of tho navy.
After the bands had played "America,"
the crowd meantime standing with un
covered -heads. Bishop Samuel Fallows
delivered a prayer. Commodore George
L Seavey, national commander of the
naval veterans, then introduced Dr. Mur

eulogized the gray-headed tars for the
part they took in the fight for the Union
nnd dedicated the arch to their honor.

spectators uncovered as the bands played
"The Star-Spangled Banner." Bishop
: Fallows delivered the benediction and
j Commodore Seavey and his escort left im
mediately for Randolph street and Michi

parade of the naval veterans.
i General John G Black to-day received a
telegram from Major General William R.
I Shafted, commanding the Department of
the Pacific, expressing regret at not being
i able to attend the Grand Army encamp
' ment for the reason that "a large number
of men. horres and military supplies are
being shipped to China and that within
the next tÂ«i days several vessels are to
be loaded, which require his attention."
General E. S. Otis telegraphed from
Rochester that he regretted that circum
stances would prevent his attendance,
and Senator john M. Thurston' and- Hon.
C II. Grosvenor. at Washington, also
telegraphed their regrets at being unable
to attend the encampment.

WARS IN LINE AT CHICAGO
THE SAX. FRANCISCO -CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 28, 1900.
Judge Rassieur, who is a leading candidate for commander in chief of the
Grand Army, was born In Germany in 1S44. He came to this country in 1851
with his parents, who settled in St. Louis. He was educated in the public
schools and attended the high school. He did not complete the high school
course, however, and at the age of 16 years took a position in a law office. Ho
was thus engaged at the breaking out of the civil war, in the spring of. 1S61.
When not quite 17 years old he was stlected by the loyal Germans of South St.
Lou's as their spokesman at a meeting held for the purpose of deciding wheth
er the citizens of the locality should express their intention of standing by the
Union or remaining neutral. At the call of young Rassieur.who had been ruled
out of order by the chairnmn of the meeting, the loyal men in attendance re
paired to another place and adopted a set of resolutions in favor of the Union,
which has become historic in the annals of Missouri. Rassieur enlisted in the
First United States Reserve Corps, Volunteers, May 7. 1S61, and was made or
derly sergeant of Company B. He was mustered out of service August 20, 1S63,
tvith the rank of major, which commission he received at the age of 20 years.^
At the close of the war he studied law and was admitted to the bar in St.
Louis April 1, 1S67. He practiced law in St. Louis until 1S94, when he was elect
ed Judge of the St. Louis Probate Court on the Republican ticket. At the ex
piration of his term in 1S9S he resumed the practice of law, in which he Is still
engaged. From 1S74 until 1S78 he was a member of the Board of Directors of
the public schools of St. Louis, holding the office of vice president during the
last year of his incumbency. In 1SS8 he was selected as attorney for the School
Board, and held the position for ten years. He jls commander of Frank P. Blair
Post N'o. 1, G. A. R., of St. Louis. He was judge advocate general of the
Grand Army of the Republic in 1S93, and department commander of Missouri
in 1S91.

predictions that the coming State Fair would
strikingly demonstrate the prevailing prosperity
of the commonwealth. It is now assured that in
every department the exhibits will show a marked im
provement over those of previous years and in addi
tion there are to be several new features of interest,
such as a display and parade of automobiles.
Every successive improvement in the State Fair is
justly a matter of congratulation to the people of the
Pacific Coast. It is the largest of the annual exhibi
tions on this side of the continent and if well sup
ported will become in time an exposition which will
have a national reputation, drawing visitors and ex
hibitors from all parts of the Union.
It depends upon the people of California to hasten
the coming of that time. When every county and
every important industry in the State is represented at
the fair by notable and thoroughly comprehensive
exhibits there will then be such a number of visit
ors as will stimulate progressive men in other States
to make exhibits so as to get the benefit of the adver
tising given in that way. Thus each improvement
will bring about another improvement and in a time
comparatively short the California State Fair will be
known and noted all over the continent.
Altogether this will be no common exposition at
Sacramento and the city will be in gala dress for over
two weeks.
This year the reports promise an exceptionally good
fair. The exhibits will be varied and numerous and
the two weeks of racing will bring to the track horses
of the first rank in almost every class' from thorough
breds to polo ponies. Among the exhibits are to be
all kinds of automobiles and the visitors will have an
opportunity for a complete study of what has been
effected up to this time in the development of the
horseless carriage. Then there are to be fine exhibits
of dogs, poultry and of Belgian hares, and as for farm
animals, the reports say livestock-raisers will find
enough to keep them on the jump from the opening
to the closing day. Droves of specially bred pigs,
hogs, 'Jerseys, shorthorns and Herefords, calves and
other domestic animals will be exhibited throughout
THE SEAPORT OF THE FUTURE.
LONDON is in danger of losing her proud posi
tion as the largest seaport in the world and the
Lower Thames Navigation Commission is now
engaged in making an investigation into the matter.
The complaint is that at or near low water the huge
ships of modern -commerce cannot ascend the river
farther than Gravesend and the largest ships cannot
even reach that point. Continental rivals are taking
the ocean trade away from London because of their
better waterways. It is stated by the E*:idon Chron
icle that "more or less delay takes place with all ves
sels having a draught of over twenty-two feet shortly
after they enter the mouth of the Thames at low
water."
This is one of the effects of the development of
large ships for merchant service. London is, of
course, rich enough to take care of itself, and from the
course now being pursued by the Lower Thames
Commission it appears certain an improvement of the
i river and the docking facilities will be entered upon
j at once. The issue, however, is interesting to other
ports as well as to the British metropolis and harbor
improvements are evidently among the engineering
works that are going to occupy no little part of the
energies of all civilized countries for some time to
come.
In a review of the subject one authority says: "The
growth in the size of ships is the most remarkable
feature in the shipping world. Thirty years ago a ves
sel of 4000 tons was considered a giant; ten years later
the biggest vessels afloat were of 8000 tons; in an
other ten years' time they were being built with 12,000
tonnage, and last year the Oceanic was launched with
a total tonnage of 17.274. Sir William White, a ship
ping expert, has declared his positive belief that we
have not arrived at anything like finality in regard to
the size of ships. But while Liverpool, Southampton,
Bristol, New York, Hamburg, Rotterdam and Ant
werp have all been preparing to meet these changes,
London has done nothing."
It is easy to foresee that the construction of larger
and still larger ships is going to have far-reaching
effects upon the ocean trade. Comparatively few sea-
I ports are naturally adapted for the traffic of the giant
! vessels and not many have the wealth required to
' make the costly improvements the needs of such ves
sels will make necessary. Consequently trade' will
tend to center in a few large ports and the smaller
cities will suffer. The moral of the lesson should be
heeded in San Francisco. We have great natural ad
vantages, but the increasing size of ocean .ships de
mands an increase of facilities here as elsewhere.
1 When the ports of the Old World are making"im
provements on a vast scale those of the New cannot
afford to lag behind.

EVERY day witnesses the declaration of promi
nent gold Democrats against Bryan. It is
noticeable that scores of these men are anti
expansionists. They oppose holding the Philippines
while they agree with nearly everybody, including
Bryan himself, that the islands must first be placated
before any policy can be adopted concerning them.
Tke:-e gentlemen all go back to his lurid declarations
and somber prophecies in 1896.
In that campaign he said that he had '"begun a war
of extermination against the gold standard. We ask
no qtjarter. we give no quarter. We shall prosecute
our warfare until there is not -an American citizen
that dares to advocate a gold-standard policy. You
ask why? We reply that the gold standard is a con
spiracy against the human race and that we should no
mere join it than we would an army marching to de
stroy our homes and to destroy our families. We be
lieve that no language can overstate the infinite dis
tre>* that the gold standard means to the human race.
I believe we shall win now. But whether we win or
not. we have begun .1 war against the gold standard
wfclth shall continue until the gold standard is driven
from our shores back to England."
His defcÂ«t in 1896 practically established the gold
standard. The business of the country felt then that
that standard was assured and our industries had
breathed into them ag?in the breath of life. By com
mon action between the sound-money men of the
country gold-standard legislation was formulated, was
pushed' by the President, the Secretary of the Treasury
and Speaker Henderson and became the law of the
land.
In a recent speech Colonel Bryan said that if he is
elected now he will carry with him into power a
Hou?e and a Senate. If this come to pass he has the
way open to execute his threats of- 1896. He can ac
complish his war of extermination.
This is threatened in the face of facts which prove
that, instead of being an agent of distress and a con
spiracy against the human race, equal in its effects
tri sn anrv destroying our homes and our families, it
has proved the solid foundation of our industries. It
has opened mills and factories, stimulated trade at
home and raised wages and prices instead of lowering
them and has made money so plentiful that New York
threatens the supremacy of London as the financial
center of the world, and we have money to lend to
Europe instead of going abroad to borrow, as for
merlv.
The gold standard has lowered interest, making
debts easier to pay and money easier to get than be
fore. All this has followed that standard against
which Bryan declared a war of extermination.
He bossed and bullied the Kansas City convention
into a redeclaration^ the war of 1896. He forced it
to again specifically declare for the silver standard,
and now stands on the Sioux Falls platform which
rejects even the silver standard and falls to an
unlimited and irredeemable issue of greenbacks as
our standard and medium of exchange. The sound
money men of the country know that this means the
expulsion from the country of both gold and silver.
The Gresham law will then operate to drive out every
form of currency except the Bryan-Populist green
back.
By promi=in;* what he cannot perform in regard to
the wretched legacies of the Spanish war, a war into
which he and his partisans madJy urped the country,
he hopes to Ret power to disorder our home finances
by descending through the purgatory of silver
into the hell of greenbacks and to revolutionize our
representative government by introducing the chaos
which will come with the initiative and referendum.
The people, with their finances in a sound condition
and their industries left free, will in their own time and
way extricate the country from the dangers and dif
ficulties which inhere in our external conditions. But
with chaos in their home government it is not likely
that they will have left the force to correct errors
external to them.
All of these considerations influence the gold
Democrats and they ?re by no means backv/ard in
declaring that their po?ition of opposition to Bryan
is unchanged, and will not be changed as long as he
holds the place he usurped and secured by fraud, mis
representation and unfairness at the head of the party
which he has debauched and demoralized.
THE GOLD STflNDflRD.
I do not propose to attempt any sketch
of our gains from this most fruitful union
between science- and invention. 1 may.
however, permit myself one parenthetic
remark on an aspect ui it which is likely
more and more to thrust itself unpleas
antly upon our attention.
Marvelous as Is the variety and ingen
uity of modern industrial methods, they
almost depend In the last resort upon our
supply of useful power: and our supply
of useful power is principally provided
for us by methods which, so fan as I can
see. have altered not at all in principle and
strangely little In detail, since the days of
Watt.
Coal, as we all know. Is the chief reser
voir of energy from which the world at
present draws, and from which we in this
country must always draw; but our main
contrivance for utilizing it la the steam
engine, and. by its essential nnture. the
steam-engine is extravagantly wasteful.
So that, when we are told as if it was
something to be proud of. that this is the
age of steam, we may admit the fact, but
can hardly share the satisfaction.
Our coal fields, as we know too well, are
limited. We certainly cannot increase
them. The boldest legislator would hesi
tate to limit their employment for pur
poses of domestic industry. So the only
possible alternative ie to economize our
method of consuming them. And for this
there would Indeed seem to be u suffi
ciency of room.
I^et a second Watt arise. I^et him brins
into general use some mode of extracting
energy from fuel which shall only waste
SO per cent of It. and lo! vour coal fields,
as sources of power, are doubled at once.
The hope seems a modest one. but it Is
not yet fulfilled; and therefore it Is that
we must qualify the satisfaction with
which at the end of the century we con
template the unbroken course of its in
dustrial triumphs.
We have, in truth, been little better
than brilliant spendthrifts. Every new
invention seems to throw a new strain
upon the vast but not illimitable re
sources of nnture. IÂ»rd Kelvin is dis
quieted about our supply of oxygen; Sir
William Crookes about our supply of ni
trate. â¢
The problem of our coal supply Is al-
URING the last one hundred years
Dthe world has seen preat wars,
great national and social upheav
als, great religious movements,
great economic changes, litera
ture and art have had their tri
umphs and have permanently en
riched the Intellectual inheritance of our
race.
Yet, large as Is the space which sub
jects like these legitimately fill In our
thoughts, much as they will occupy the
future historian, It is not among these
that I seek for the most Important and
the most fundamental differences which
separate the present from preceding ages.
Rather is this to be found In the cumula
tive products of scientific research, to
which no other period offers a precedent
or a parallel.
No single discovery, it may be, can be
compared In its results to that of Coper
nicus; no single discoverer can be com
pared In genius to Newton; but in their
total effects tho advances made by the
nineteenth century are not to be matched.
Not only is the surprising Increase of
knowledge new, but ..ie use to which it
has been put is new also. The growth of
industrial Invention is not a fact we are
permitted to forget. We do, however,
sometimes, forget how much of it is due
to close connection between theoretic
knowledge and its utilitarian application
which, in its degree, is altogether unex
ampled in the history of mankind.
I suppose that at this moment If we
were allowed a vision of the embryonic
forces which are predestined most potent
ly to affect the future of mankind we
should have to look for them not In the
legislature nor In. the press, nor on the
platform, nor in the schemes of practical
statesmen, nor the dreams of political
theorists, but in the laboratories of scien
tific students whose names are but little
in the mouths of men, who cannot them
selves forecast the results of their own
labors and whose theories would scarce
he- understood by those whom they will
chiefly benefit.

RECESSIONAL
BRYfJN AND LINCOLN.
GOLONEL BRYAN goes continually to the
sayings of Lincoln for the garniture of his ac
ceptance and other oratory. He is just now
using what the Great Emancipator had to say about
the axioms of Jefferson in favor of self-government
ar.d government by consent. He states the plain and
old principles of republican government, as if he had
just discovered them, or as if when uttered by Jeffer
son and Lincoln they had fallen on deaf cars and been
forgotten. It is only necessary to say that nobody
takes the adverse side in respect to these axioms.
Nobody who opposes him denies them and there arc
none among the Republicans who fail to hold them
in undying respect as tules of conduct in a republican
government. Colonel Bryan might as well appear
as the champion of the multiplication table and ex
pect a dispute of the proposition that twice two are
four.
The only defiant deniers of these principles as re
stated by Lincoln are the supporters of Colonel
Bryan. For their own convenience and in their own
wavs, running from the murder of men to nullification
of the constitution, the Southern States, which will
give Colonel Bryan 120 electoral votes, are flagrantly
violating the principles of Lincoln, while this candi
date for the Presidency goes up and down accusing
the party of Lincoln of infidelity to his teachings.
Colonel Bryan carefully picks and chooses his quo
tations. He has put Lincoln as saying: "When the
white man governs himself that is self-government,
but when he governs himself and another man that is
despotism." This is a partial quotation, omitting
the text, which is a direct comment on the acts of
the South, which deny to the negro the right of gov
ernment by consent.
The full quotation is: "If the negro is a man, is it
not to that extent a total destruction of self-govern
ment to say that he, too, shall not govern himself?
When the white man governs himself, that is self
government; but when he governs himself and an
other man, without that other's consent, that is des
potism."
It was this saying of Lincoln that led his party,
after his assassination, to pass the fifteenth amend
ment to the constitution, giving the negro the ballot
that he might govern himself and consent to govern
ment. Colonel Bryan now charges the Republican
party with intending to destroy government by con
sent in the Philippines. That policy may be inde
fensible if it be proven, which it is not. But in the
light of Lincoln's full statement self-government is al
ready destroyed in this country by Colonel Bryan's
party.
What refinement of hypocrisy it is for him to claim
votes upon the declaration that he will give self
government to turbulent people seven thousand miles
away, while he makes no pledge to restore it to a
larger number right at home?
He has recently bsen talking patronizingly to Re
publicans, asking them to vote for him on this issue.
Let their answer be that if destruction of self-govern
ment is an evil, carrying many future miseries in its
train, the men who nominated and support Bryan
have already destroyed it at home, if Lincoln told the
truth. That which he accuses Republicans of intend
ing to do abroad, his own party has already done at
home. His charge against Republicans has no proof
but his assertion. The same offense by his own party
is proved by its accomplishment. Really, it requires
a cheek of bronze for him to scold Republican lead
ers and beg the votes of their followers upon that
issue.
One of his leading supporters, Senator Tillman. said
in the Senate in a set and prepared speech, describing
the Southern methods of denying self-government to
the negroes: "We shot them. We used fraud, false
counts and tissue ballots. At length growing tired
of these we amended our State constitution and elimi
nated the negro vote."
If Colonel Bryan wish to prove his right to a
reputation for courage, let him go to Tillman's State,
quote Lincoln in full and argue for the right of self
government for the negro there, as well as for the
tribes in the Philippines. It is safe to say that he will
not do this. He prefers to attempt the deception of
the Northern people on this issue and present himself
to them as the avatar of Lincoln, to showing himself
deserving to wear the robes of the" Emancipator by
doing as he would have done.
OUR neighbors, the Canadians, are expecting a
general election to take place some time this
fall. The date has not yet been fixed, but it
is believed the Prime Minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier.
will determine it to be not later than October. There
will be therefore a short campaign and judging from
all reports it will be a lively one.
There will be no â¢'paramount issue" in the
contest. The Liberal Ministry will ask a vote
of confidence from the constituencies upon the
record of the administration as a whole and
not upon some single question. The challenge will
doubtless be accepted in the form it is given and the
Conservatives will undertake to convince a majority
of the people that even if the Laurier Ministry has
done nothing exceptionally bad, yet a change of ad
ministration would be beneficial.
Among the actions of the Ministry which will be
subject to condemnation by the Conservatives will be
the dispatch of troops from Canada to fight in the
British wars in South Africa, the management of the
Yukon gold districts, the steps taken to procure the
construction of an all-Canadian route to Dawson, tho
preferential tariff in favor of British goods and the
arrangements made for settling various controversies
between Canada and the United States.
In one respect the campaign will be peculiar, for in
times past the Conservatives have been the support
ers of a close union with Great Britain, while the
Liberals have tended more and more toward making
Canada independent. Now the Liberals will have to
sustain Lauricr's action in sending Canadian troops 10
South Africa and the Conservatives will have to at
tack it. The question is a far-reaching one, for if
Canada is to follow Great Britain in all British wars
without having any voice in the Cabinet that declares
war, or the Parliament that votes money for it, Cana
dian independence will not be anything more than an
empty name.
The French Canadians are an uncertain element in
the situation. It is known they have been hitherto
opposed to being dragged into British imperial poli
tics and consequently they will probably be inclined
to vote against a Ministry that has established a pre
cedent for sending Canadians to fight whenever
Britain gets into a war. It happens, however, that
Prime Minister Laurier is himself a French Canadian,
and is very popular among men of his race and his
personal influence may counterbalance any objections
the French have to that feature of his policy. This
will be the first test vote taken on the question and
no one appears able to forecast the result.
The very fact that the Ministry does not put its
imperial policy in the forefront of the contest may be
taken as evidence that the Ministers are by no means
sure it will receive approval. They are certainly very
careful to ask for a vote on their record as a whole
and not upon that particular issue. Thus Sir Richard
Cartwright is quoted as saying in a recent address:
"We ask for such trust and loyalty as self-respecting
men can grant to leaders who have shown themselves
worthy to be trusted; to leaders who have had to deal
with serious difficulties, and who have solved those
difficulties well; to leaders who have earned the
thanks of their sovereign; to leaders who have raised
Canada to a higher pinnacle than Canada has ever be
fore reached in the eyes of the world, and in so doing
have helped to weld Canada into what will be, I hope,
a united and powerful nation."
It is a vague proposition, but after all a fair one.
Still the outer world would like to know by what
steps the Canadian Liberals hope to weld Canada.
Great Britain and the rest of the empire into a united
nation. Either the Canadians must obtain equal
representation in the imperial Parliament or else the
welding process will destroy every particle of that in
dependence which Liberals in the past have been so
earnest in promoting and augmenting.

Two Out of Town Mills Accept tha
Eight-Hour Proposition and
Will Enter Local
Field.
The executive committee of the Building
Trades Council at a special meeting held
last evening issued a' statement In which
It again offers to submit the millmen's
eight-hour workday cause to arbitration
at the hands of five impartial Judges, ana
in addition Issues a challenge to any or
ganization vesltd with power to handle
the mill-owners' side to a joint debate.
The council voted to uphold President
McCarthy In the position he has taken,
and the attacks upon him at the meeting
of the Builders' Exchange last Saturday
were deplored and characterized as un
kind and wholiy uncalled for.-
It was reported that two more out-of
town mills had gone over to the millmen's
sÂ»Ide. They are the Union Planing Com
pany of Stockton and the Pioneer Mill
and Lumber Company of San Rafael. The
two employ a combined force of about
seventy-five men. Both will at once com
pete with the nine-hour mills now run
ning in this city. The council will take
pains to turn as much business to these
out-of-town concerns as possible, and with
the eight local mills running eight hours
the union believes the home trade can be
pretty well supplied. Local offices of the
two outside mills will be opened here im
mediately.
Carpenters Quit Work.
Carpenters quit work on a number ot
buildings yesterday where stuff from nine
hour mills was being used. Several men
employed by Jones, Peterson & Bountree
in the" erection of a house on Golden Oate
avenue laid down their tools because some
of the material was from the mill of An
drew Wilkie. At the St. Joseph's Home,
where an addition is being built, the car
penters were all called off. and there whs
similar trouble at the corner of McAllister
and Webster streets, where three flats are
being built. The material at these places
was turned out by the Union and lluber
companies, respectively.
The following is the statement given out
by the Trades Council last evening:
The contention of the mtllmen for the eight
hour day found its way Into a special meet
ing of the Builders' Exchange called at the re
quest ofpeveral members, particularly that of
John McOllvray. The Builders' Exchange is
composed of gome bosses comprising the build
ing trades and Includes the various mill-owners
who are oarties to the controversy. At . the
meeting Mr. CSIlvray tried to assume the
management of the entire business, first ask
ing that a committee be appointed to draft
resolutions for discussion, then supporting a
resolution to relegate the whole subject mat
ter to the lnt> rested parties â the mlll-cwners
and millmenâ and then. }n his ardor, attempted
the adoption of a resolution to have appointed
a committee of five to settle the difficulty, th<*
latter artkin being In direct conflict with the
action formerly taken. It is plain. to be seen
that Mr. Ollvray did not know what I he
was there for or If he did was Ignorant of
the means of carrying out his Intentions.
However, he was decided upon one. Issue, and
that was that the mill-owners, who composed
a large element of the assembly, should have
all tho time they desired in which to present
their case, but no outsider should violate the

ANOTHER OFFER
TO ARBITRATE
MILL TROUBLE
At a meeting to be held In thA near
future a permanent organization will be
effected. . :
OAKLAND, Aug. 27.â The first step to
ward action with relation to the millmen's
fight -was taken to-night by thÂ© builders
and contractors of this city, who effected
a temporary organization at a meeting
held at 46S Tenth street. The meeting was
brought about by the mlllownerM, who
hope to secure the moral support of these
employers.
At to-night's meeting about thirty local
builders and contractors were present. J
B McDonald was elected chairman and
B. J. Walker temporary secretary. The
situation in building circles was discussed
at length, but no definite action was
taken.
Builders to Organize.
Members of the Mill-owners' Association
say there are no new developments on
their side. All the mills were running yes
terday, and those that have not already
got a full force at work are adding one or
two new men every day. so that within
a week or two they â¢will be running fully
equipped. ; .
Labor Is appreciative and rewards as aulck
as It punishes, and now, to show Its belief In

lenger, any organization vested with the power
to handle the mill-owners* side to Joint debate,

Is Justice and .we are ready at any time to sub
mit our cause to five Impartial Judges.
During the meeting Messrs Chlsholm and Mc-
Gllvray. particularly the latter, indulged In
various abuse, nndlns fault with the fact that
Mr. McCarthy draws a salary from the Cali
fornia Hotel, and as Civil Service Commis
sioner, and from the Building Trades Council,
which latter Rtatement Is absolutely untrue.
ItOKirdlng the former salaries we believe that
he earns them and feel that his employers,
except those who made themselves so officious
at tho exchange mf-eting, are satisfied with his
stewardship. While a large majority of tho
members of the Kxchanpe believe In the Justice
of theelght-hourdayand are thoroughly satisfied
with the conduct. Integrity and conscientious
ness of the persons composing organized labor,
there are also those who have an Inherent
animosity to those who labor and their fellow
men In general and regard them only as
Instruments by which certain ends can be
attained. These are generally those who, at
one time, were the implements of severe task
masters and now show their sour and embit
tered dispositions as employers, believing tbat
nothing good can emanate from the man who
labors for a livelihood. Mr. McCHIvray Is
pleased to call organized labor demagogues
and disturbers, hut from such a source it
amounts to nothing. On the other hand, or
ganized labor has pretty well demonstrated to
the nubile that it is awake to the best Inter
ests of the city and Is In accord with all con
ditions calculated to benefit and Improve our
city. This fact was evidenced by the support
given to tho charter and its adoption after
several unsuccessful attempts had been mada
to obtain a new organic law. Organized labor
is In the fight to win regardless of the force
and coercion upon some of our contractors
which Is being applied and practiced by a few
of the mill-owners and a few lumber com
panies who are their financial backers. Most
of the contractors have proven trlemselves Just
and loyal and shall have tho unqualified sup
port of labor.
President McCarthy's Salaries.
After he was shamed into permitting: eoae one
to Kay a word In favor of the mlllmen he con
sented to have a mlllman address the moetinfc,
but as no member of the union was present
It wan suggested that Mr. McCarthy be al
lowM the privilege. This met with Instant
opposition on the part of Messrs. McGllvray
ami "Wilson, who declared that the Building
Trades Council or Its president haft nothing
to do with the matter. As a matter of fact
the MHImen's Union, being an Integral part of
the HulMltic Trades Council for some past
Fix months, decided upon the eight-hour day
and requested that the same would go into
effect on May 1. The council did not approvt
of May 1, but approved of August 13 as the
date when the eight-hour day should ko Into
effect for th* mlllmen.
Thus It will be seen that action had Its
birth In the MHImen's Union and was after

there is assurance that the Fourth

ed Republican primary in the Fourth Dis
trict Kelly failed to observe the require
ments of the official call Issued by the
Republican State Central Committee. He
neglected to issue a call for the primary
and therefore, according to the call of the

Favor Revising or Condensing
"Westminster Declaration.
The Westminster confession was the
subject of a thoughtful discussion at the
regular meeting of the Presbyterian Min- I
l?ter!al Union at the headquarters of the
Occidental Board on Sacramento street
yesterday morning. About thirty clergy
men were present, besides a number of
prominent women church workers. From
now until next May, when '.he Presbyte
rian conference in Philadelphia is to vote
upon the question of revising the confes
sion, the Presbyterian churches in this
city, and In fact all over the country, will
make a practical study of the question,
holding general discussions in many of the
several churches for the benetit of the
members.
Among the speakers yesterday was J.
\V. Dinsmore of San Jose, who spoke very
highly of the confession, but favored a
shorter translation. In these days of
btxrrjr m<>st people don't have the time to
peruse thou?httully .'ill the articles. Con
densation would enable one to express his
btiiÂ«f. just as is possible with the ten
commandments, which are brief, but
ftsr.d for a great deal. Dr. Dinsmore
â¢could use the commandments as an ex
ample of brevity to be followed in con
ilvr.fiag the confession.

however, said there was nothing in the
Westminster confession which he could j

The sub-committee of the returning
board of the county committee met yes
terday afternoon and received a number
of protests. That of the Fortieth Assem
bly District was taken up and the after
noon spent in interviewing- witnesses for
both sides. The work of the committee
was not completed during the afternoon
and It adjourned until 8 p. m. Numerous
protests had been Hied in the meantime
and it was decided to take them up in
order.
The course of the County Committee
in standing resolutely at the post of duty
and maintaining a lirm attitude against
compromise With fraud and crime is re
ceiving the commendation of good citi
zens.
Yesterday Alfred Bouvier, chairman,
and James A. \Vilson, secretary, issued a
call for a special meeting of the County
Committee at Shiels' Hall next Saturday
evening. The Session will be executive
and therefore the "hopheads" from the
Mint saloon will not vote on roll call. *
Ail danger that the Mint saloon bosses
will gain control of the municipal con
vention of the Republican party has van
ished. The delegates elected "under the
auspices of the Republican County Com
mittee will organize the convention and
make the nominations. Desertions from
the camp of the bosses. are of hourly oc
currence. The throngs assembled at the
rooms of the committee signify that the
regular organization is fully recognized.
Great pressure has been brought to bear
on the Republican State Committee t<Â»
elicit expression of sympathy in favor of
the defeated bosses, but the pressure has
been in vain.
Good citizens of the Republican party
throughout the State will hoar with grati
fication that the bosses have been outgen
eraled by the reform leaders.
Politicians cannot understand how Kelly
happened to make such a blunder. It Is
surmised that he was so busily engaged
in rounding up loafers and opium !iend3
to Impersonate decent citizens at the local
primary thnt he overlooked the important
requirements of the State Committee with
reference to Congressional district con
ventions.
Returns received from the primary elec
tions held in many counties of the State
last Saturday render it 'possible to fore
cast the complete Republican Congres
sional ticket in California, It is rea
sonably certain that Frank L. Coombs
will rally a sufficient number of county
delegations to win the nomination in the
First District. The convention will . be
held at Santa Cruz next week.
Returns received from the Second Con
gressional District foreshadow the nomi
nation of Colonel E. A. Forbes of Marys
vllle. The Sacramento County delegation
will support Colonel Forbes. lie will
also have the support of the delegation
trom liutte. Sutler and Yuba, and will
probably get many votes from Placer, Ne
vada. h.\ Dorado and Tuolumne.
Victor H. Metcalf is already the Ree
publican nominee in the Third District,
jame:? McL.achlan was recently nominated
for Congress in the Sixth. J. C. Needl:am
was unanimously renominated yesterday
in the Seventh.
So far as can be ascertained there is no
organized opposition to the renomination
of Eugene F. Loud In the Fifth. The in
dications are that he will get the nomina
tion on the first ballot if he is not chosen
by acclamation.
Julius Kahn is the only Republican can
didate mentioned for the Fourth District
and is sure to receive the nomination.
The Republican ticket may thus bo
given:
First District â Frank L. Coombs, Napa.
Second District â E. A. Forbes, Yuba.
Third Districtâ Victor H. Metcalf, Ala
meda.
Fourth Districtâ Julius Kahn, San Fran
cisco.
Fifth Districtâ Eugene F. Loud, San
Francisco.
Sixth Districtâ James McLachlan, Los
Angeles.
Seventh Districtâ J. C. Needham, Stan
islaus.
The Democrats will put up a strong
fight in several of the districts. State
Senator R. Porter Ashe will probablv be
chosen to lead the contest against itahn
in the Fourth District.
Josenh D. Sproule of Chico vrtll doubt
less receive the Democratic indorsement
for Congress in the Second District and
will therefore be the opponent of Colonel
Forbes in a race which promises to be
exciting.
In the Fifth District the Democrats talk
of bringing James V. Coleman into the
contest. II. C. Gesford is also spoken of.
In the Sixth District the Democrats talk
freely of nominating General John R.
Mathews to lead the race against Mr.
Mcl^achlan.
Form of proxy as follows will be recog
nized by the Republican State convention
at Santa Cruz:

To-morrow evening the Bryan and Stev
enson Democratic Compaign Club of the
Thirty-ninth Assembly District will meet
at Saratoga Ha!l and lodge a protest
aga!r.st the high-handed and raw work of
the Phelan faotion. Following is the text
of the call for the meeting:
The primary election held last Saturday
night under the auspices of the Phelonic
plague ring of the Democratic party was
a. bowling farce and a fhain. The rolls
were stuffed and padded and the result
of the so-called primary declared before
the hour set for the pretended voting to
begin.
It is "well known to, intelligent and fair
minded Democrats of gan Francisco that
t-everal thousand Democratic voters of
the city were excluded from participation
in the 6O-caJled election of delegates to
the State Convention of the party.

The wrong is committed in the Republican
party or in the Democratic ranks.
There ere many signs of opon revolt In
the Democratic party of San Francisco.
Decent Republicans would not for an In
stant submit to the outrages which the
bog-us Civil Service push is Inflicting on
reputable taxpayers and citizens of Demo
cratic faith. The Call is against ballot*
box stuffing, repeating and the denial of
Sham.

Under Their Auspices Proves a

Board of Examiners Will Present
Resolutions Toward That End
to San Jose Convention.
The City Board of Examiners passed an
important resolution yesterday for" pre
sentation to I the biennial convention ot
county and city Superintendents. The
document touches a point which is of vital
interest to every teacher, namely, the pre
sentation of a petition to the State Legis
lature to the end that certificates granted
to teachers may be made permanent In the
county in which they have been granted.
It is provided that before such action Is
taken the teacher must provide satisfac
tory proof of five years' experience in the
schools of the county in which the certio
rate was taken out. A four-fifths majority
in the Board of Education is also one of
the requirements called for in'connectlon
with the granting of ,a life certificate. The
convention will be called at. San Jose to
day, and delegates will be asked to inter
est themselves in the matter.

Struck on His Head on the Stone
Pavement and Sustained Frac
ture of Skull.
The autopsy made yesterday by Morgue
Surgeon Leland upon the body of Edmund
Williamson revealed the cause of death to
be fracture of the skull, with the resulting
cerebral hemorrhage.
P. E. Chapln, assistant superintendent
of the California Street Railway Com
pany, called at the Morgue yesterday and
made a statement which tends to prove
that Williamson was to blame for his own
death. He was seated on the inside of the
car. and when It passed Powell. street Wil
liamson walked to the back platform ana
got off while It was in motion in front ot
the Stanford mansion. He fell and struck
on the back of his head.
The car was stopped and the Injured
man taken on beard and his wound exam
ined by Dr. Lustlg, who was one of the
passengers. When the car arrived at the
crossing of California and Kearny streets
Williamson was taken into Joy's drug
store, where Dr. Lustie dressed several
scalp wounds. The patient walked away
from the drugstore, and was next seen
near Sheriff Lackmann's grocery, on Cali
fornia street, between Stockton and Pow
ell, in charge af two young men who
had piloted him thither.

Old residents of San Francisco will learn
with regret of the death of Amos Jerome
Bailey, which occurred last Sunday after
noon at St. Luke's Hospital. The de
ceased Â¦was widely known in this city and
throughout the State. On his arrival in
California in 1850 he located In Columbia,

he removed to Stockton, where he en
gaged in business with an uncle. Subse
quently he entered the hotel business, and
for several years conducted the famous
Weber House in Stockton. From the ho
tel he transferred his interest anew to
mining 1 in Tuolumne County.
Bailey met with great success and final
ly removed to this city, where he was
known for years as a prominent figure in
minine and stock speculation. . In the
days when Bailey enjoyed his greatest
prosperity he delighted in unostentatious
acts of charity nnd philanthropy. He ex
pended thousands of dollars in relief of
the needy and hl3 epitaph will be written

casion to know and appreciate his kind
ness. The funeral of the dead pioneer
will take place at 11 a. in. to-dav from
Mission street, near Twentv-third. The
interment will be at the Masonic Ceme
tery.

He is in splendid health and is ready to j

Jle also expressed sorrow on learning the
news of the death of Supervisors Helms

"The improvements being made In the

ground tunneling. New York has begun
her Broadway tunnel and London and
Paris have theirs in actual operation and
are extending the system day by day. In
I>ondon the tunnel is as much as ninety-
Jive feet under the j-urface of the ground,
and you descend to the stations In large
electric elevators. The cars are brllliant-
Jy Illuminated and the tunnel Is lined with
white tiles. The motive power is under
ground electricity. This system was !n-
Ftalled by American companies and has
already cost London $15,000,000. The same
Fystern Is being introduced Into, Paris.
Â¦Ultimately, when our city's population in

relieve the business on Market street.

RETURNS FROM
HIS VACATION
"I left this city on June 29 ani attended

"I find in conversation with people that
Bryan's chances are regarded as good;
that which most militated against him
four years ag-o were his financial theories,
which created sn actual panic among peo
ple c-nzBgod in all kinds of pursuits and
!t was that feeling of uncertainty that de
feated him. Xow there is no panic what
ever, but there Js a strong feeling that
v.e are departing from the traditional pol
icy of the Government and are launching
out on a new and unprintable field which
will take millions cf money and a stand-
Ing army to exploit and when exploited
will be found to be barren. The conserv
ative interests of the country are really
arrayed against foreign alliance and the
acquisition of territory in the Orient. So
on that Issue Bryan will receive a great
many votes that he never received before
and will receive Democratic votes that
wero lost to him four years ago on tho
currency question which has been prac

.Prominent Ladies Take Preliminary-
Steps to Perfect Permanent
Organization.
Preliminary steps were taken yesterday
afternoon to organize a San Francisco
section of the Council of Jewish Women.
With this end In view a large
number of prominent Jewish ladies met
in the Temple Bmanu-Kl and ex
pressed their desire to have a local or
ganization. Mrs. M. C. Sloss presided at
the meeting and Introduced the speaker
of the afternoon. Miss Sadie 'American, of
Chicago, secretary of the National Coun
cil of Jewish Women.
Miss American delivered a very able
address, tracing back the history of the
council to the time of its beginning at
the Congress of Religions at the World's
Fair. She went into details as to the
splendid work of tho society and told of
Us marvelous growth and continued ad
vancement. According to the speaker, al
though the object of the council is the
study of things Jewish, still the organi
zation is a non-sectarian one and non-
Jewish members are as welcome as those
of the Jewish faith.
After Miss American's eloquent appeal
to the ladies it was decided to appoint
temporary officers and an advisory board
with power to act in the matter of estab
lishing a local council.
The officers chosen were: Mrs. M. C.
Sloss, president, and Miss Voorsange*-,
secretary. The ladies of the advisory
board are as follow*: Mrs. M. J. Bran
denstein, Mrs. Max Cohen, Mrs. Abo
lirown, Mrs. M. Banner, Mrs. Jcs-se
Lillenthal. Miss Falkcnstein, Mrs. Ilcnry
Wangenhelm, Mrs. Frohman, Miss Conn,
Miss Aronson and Miss Levy.
Rev. Or. Voorsanger and Rev. Dr. Xieto
were present at the meeting and deliv
ered addresses in which they promised
their hearty support to a local council.

We would also call your attention tq, the
manner in which the dairymen of this district
use the public streets as a dump for refuse and
sewage. These abuses are primarily caused
by the inattention of the Police Department,

are health officers and should Inform these
p.eople Â¦ BAillty of the above offenses that they
are violating the laws by maintaining such
nuisances.
The resolution authorizing an expendi
ture of $3000 to be made out of the urgent
necessity fund in payment to Peter G. Du
Py, treasurer of the joint committee of
tho Native Sons of the Golden West as
the city's contribution for the semi-cen
tennial celebration, was finally passed.
The petition of the University Mound
Improvement Club for the opening up of
the streets in that district was referred
to the Street Committee. The petition
recites that the Board of Public Works
has not complied with the request to have
the law enforced. Since two notices have
been issued by the board a water tank
has been erected, which is claimed to be
a nuisance. The petition concludes:
The Street Committee withdrew its re
port recommending the denial of the pro
test of the West of Castro Street Improve
ment Club against the maintenance of
Gray Brothers', rock-crusher at Twenty
sixth and Douglass streets. This action
was the result of an opinion of City At
torney Lane on the subject, in which that
olilcial holds that the two permits granted
to W. J. Holmes, the predecessor of Gray
Brothers, to operate an engine and boiler
near the crusher was not assignable to
Gray Brothers. Lane holds that the per
mits were nothing more than personal
privileges granted by the city, that they
were revocable at its pleasure and wero
in no sense property, and that as they
â¢lid not run with the land they could not
be bought or sold, and they were not as
signable.
Attorney Ames addressed the board and
contended that the City Attorney had
acted on an imperfect statement of the
case. The permission enjpyed by Holmes
had been extended by resolution by a
former Board of Supervisors to the suc
cessor of Holmes after the latter had been
granted his permit. That fact. Ames
said, had not been submitted to the City
Attorney, and it was only fair that the
matter should be re-referred for ills fur
ther investigation.
The former resolution directing the
Chief of Police to cause the firm of Gray
Bros, to forthwith discontinue the main
tenance of the steam boiler until such
time as legal permission may be acquired
by them to continue the use of the same
was allowed to stand.
$3000 for Native Sons' Celebration.
Dispute Over Bock-Crusher.
Attorney James Alva Watt said that
Mrs. Reynolds was not the only property
owner who protested against the main
tenance of the tracks outside of the cen
ter line of the street. He asked for a
postponement, as it would be possible to
obtain a practical unanimity among sur
rounding residents against the nuisance.
No objection, ne said, is made to the road
throughout its length, but it was Insisted
upon that this one block shall - be recon
structed to comply with the law. It would
cost but $1500 to do so, and it was unjust
and unfair to the property owners, whose
rights are conceded by the company, to
wait two or four years, or an indefinite
period, to put the roadway into the con
dition that the law exacts.
The petition of Ann E. Reynolds to cause
to be removed a certain portion of the
track of the Presidio and Ferries Railway
system, which lies close to the sidewalk
in front of her premises on Union street,
between Hyde and Larkin, was laid over
yesterday by the Board of Supervisors
for one week. The Board of Public Works
reported that it would be necessary within
the next few years to rebuild the cable
alleyway and roadbed of the road. Sec
retary Laton of the company Informed the
board that the work of reconstructing the
road could not be undertaken for four
years, though it might be commenced in
two years, after the bonds had been re
deemed.

IN THE MIDDLE

"I understand that the Board of Ed
ucation charges that my deputies have
not visited the schools, as It Is their duty
to do. The charge is false."
Yet another dispute js agitating the Su
perintendent. President Mark is charged
by Webster with having irregularly ap
pointed three teachers â Al T. Haley. Dor
othy F. Moran and Miss A. McColganâ
on the substitute list last January, on
which account Webster refused to sign
their salary warrants. This, however,
promises to end amicably. Speaking of the
matter Webster said: "I believe that the
appointment of these teachers was mere
ly a misanderstanding on Mr. Mark's
part. The board passed the demands in
regular form, but of course under the
circumstances I refused to sign the war
rants. Mr. Mark admits his mistake, and
so the matter is closed."
Webster calls attention to that section
of the charter which requires the Board
of Education to visit the schools and re
port the result of their 'visit to the Su
perintendent. This has not been complied
with, he says.
Hostilities are on again between Super
intendent Webster and the Board of Ed
ucation. This time the board i3 accused
of meddling with Webster's deputies, and
the consequent disturbance has caused
Indignation to hum around school head
quarters. It is alleged that the board
wants to dismiss tho Superintendent's
deputies, which latter Webster claims
the board has no more right to interfere
with than the School Superintendent has
to dictate how affairs shall be run In the
board's department. Webrter fears t..at
even if the board is foiled in discharging
the deputies they may even matters up
by reducing their salaries.
"If the members of the board should
resort to this means," said Webster yes
terday, "I shall be prepared to check
mate them. Six contests nave aireauy
been waged between the board and my
self, and I do not think that 1 have come
out second best in any of them."

Several Important Changes in Rules
to Be Adopted â No Joker in
Contract for Supplemen
tary Readers.
The Board of Education reorganized the
substitute list of public school teachers
yesterday and as a consequence some of
the fifteen teachers who were on the list
will be transferred to the unassigned list.
The resolution on the subject recites that
owing to the recent consolidation of
classes and the abolition of certain
schools the present number of substitutes
is far greater than is icquired to conduct
the department properly. All teachers
elected on and after January 12, 1S9S, who
have not been assigned regularly to a
class will now be placed on the day un
a<==iÂ£rned list without pay, to take effect
Sepieml-ier 1, 1900. ' - '; -Â¦.â¢ "". -
President Mark stated that the date,
January 12, 1898, had been selected as a
ba^ls on which to .reorganize the substi
tute list merely Â¦ as an experiment and
that it might be chrmtred should the exi
gencies demand it. The list of day unas
signed teachers, with the dates of their
appointments, is now as follows:
Miss K. G. Sullivan. January 12. 1S3S: Misses
J McDonald, K. Hawkins, January 26, 1S3S:
M. Nolan, M. A. "Wright, K. Stack. E. Cleary
and A. Murphy. February 2.'!, 1S9S; Misses M. A.

Miss M. F. Mooney, January 26. 1S99.
A number of proposed changes in the
rules of the board were presented, but
their adoption was postponed until to
morrow. Superintendent Webster Informed
the board that notice of any changes In
the rules must be given at a previous
meeting. The chances which will be
adopted follow:
Section loo, which says that all com
plaints or charges against teachers or
other employes of the School Department
shall be in writing and.be filed with tho
board is amended to read "filed with the
president of the board." This change is
in conformity with another rule which
gives the president the right to suspend
a teacher pending investigation.
The first paragraph of section 52, pro
viding that the substitute list shall con
sist of fifteen teachers is suspended tem
porarily pending the reorganization of the
substitute list, to date from August 1,
19-30.
The following clause is stricken out of
section r.2: "The evening substitute list
shall consist of three teachers under pay,
who shall report for uuty nightly. This
is to take effect August 1, 1WJ."
The following is added to section SO:
"Principals must enter in a book the
name of the pupil, the number and the
kind of books furnished him by the de
partment and sec that they are properly
kept and returned to the office of the
principal at the close of the school term
or year. The principals must hold par
ents responsible whose # children misuse
textbooks or books for supplementary
use furnished them by the department.
Miss A. B. Cookson, formerly of tho
Grant Primary School, was assigned to
the Cooper Primary School during the
leave of Miss L. E. Wolf.
Miss M. A. Latham will be continued
as teacher in the Grant Primary School
during the leave of Miss A. B. Campbell.
A leave of absence was granted to Al
bert \V. Lyser of the Lincoln Evening
School for a period of two months from
Augut 23, 1900, to October 23, 1900.
H. E. Harris, special teacher, was
placed on the eligible list of evening
teachers in order that he may substitute
in the drawing departments of the
evening schools.
W. R. Morgan, a teacher of drawing in
the Lincoln Evening School, was tempo
rarily assigned to the head of the drawing
department of the school during the ab
sence of F. Rothgan?cr.
Miss Josie Blum of the eligible list was
elected to a regular class In the Horace
Mann Evening School.
A representative of tho book firm which
has the JGOOO contract for supplementary
readers explained to the satisfaction of
the board that there was no joker in the
contract, as published in an evening pe
per. The discount of 2\i per cent was in
accordance with the terms of its bid,
which was the lowest of those submitted.
The secretary was Instructed to adver
tise for bids In accordance with plans and
specifications in his office for the purpose
of improving the plumbing of the Frank

pairs as sanitation may require.

The Board of Supervisors received two

petition now before it that an ordinance
be passeil'making It legal to work laundry
employes from G a. m. to 7'p. m. only. The
two communications were referred to the
License and Order Committee, which has
the proposed ordinance under considera
tion. The first petition is from the civic
section of the California Clubs, and says:
To the Hoard*, of Supervisors: Throush their
experience with workings iris' oluba; thr-jush
the reports of women physicians and through
personal visitation of the" various laundries of
the city. th<> civic section of the California
Olub has long been acquainted vvlth and long
deplored the hard conditions under which this?
particular work is carried on. The unusually
long hours, often with a very fatieuins; position,
the sharp alternation of heat, chill and damp
ness make this occupation one of much sevurity
at best. Many years i\t such work has proven
to have seriously impaired the vigor of the
young women so employed and to have proven
disastrous to their later duties as wives and
mothers.
As an organization, therefore, strongly in
sympathy with working women, the California
Club most respectfully and earnestly prays your
honorable | body to devise some proper means
for the amelioration of those difficult condi
tions. DOROTHEA MOORK. M. P..

laundry employes are suffering through
the operation of an existing municipal or

of labor In laundries at from 7 a. m. to 10
p. m., and in demanding on behalf of 2000
helpless girls and women a material re
duction in the time they may be required
to labor. The resolution says in conclu
sion:
We heartily approve of the timely and oppor
tune action of Organized Labor in calling the
attention of the public to the conditions little
short of slavery or serfdom at present prevail
ing in our local laundries and in championing
the cause of those toilers who need sympathy,

NEWS FROM THE
OCEAN AND THE
WATER FRONT
The novel point as to whether the estate
of a decedent whose inhuman conduct in
life compelled his wife to seek and secure
a divArcc is liable for the payment of ali
mony under a judgment rendered against
the deceased Is soon to be decided by
Judge Bahrs. Mrs. Aleece Van Bergin,
former wife of the late William Van Ber
gin, through her attorney. \V. 'H. L.
Barnes, has petitioned the Superior Court
for an order setting aside in the hands
of a receiver sufficient securities belong
ing ito decedent's estate to assure the per
manent payment to her of $50 a month
during her natural life, the sum named
being in accordance with the alimony
judgment rendered against the deceased
when Mrs. Van Bergin secured her di
vorce.
Mrs. Van Bergin married the late Wil
liam Van Bergin, a son of the late Nich
olas Van Bergin, the wealthy liquor deal
er, on November 29, 1890. Immediately af
ter their maitiage, as she alleged in her
complaint for divorce, he began a course
of brutal treatment. In addition to hu
miliating her before her friends, she
charged him with having beaten her and
on one occasion applied a lighted cigar to
her bare flesh, causing not only a painful
but serious wound. Among the methods
pursued by the deceased to humiliate his
wife was one that was certainly original.
When her friends called he immediately
proceeded to post signs about the room,
each containing . more than a hint that
the presence of the caller was objection
able. These signs read: "For God's sake
pack your trunk and go." "Pack your
trunk and get." "Git out of here." "For
God's sake, go home." The purpose of
the signs was usually accomplished, the
complaint recited.
After her former husband's death Mrs.
Van Bergin applied to John W. Van Ber
pin. administrator of decedent's estate,
which is valued at $60,000. for payment of
her judgment. The administrator refused
to pay the same on the ground that
the death of William Van Bergin tho
judgment ceased to operate. Heirs of the
deceased contest Mrs. Van Berlin's effort
to make the judgment permanent against
the estate. General Barnes argued before
Judge Bahrs yesterday that jiot alone in
common law but und^r the statutes of
this State his client was entitled to judg
ment as prayed. . Judge Bahrs took the
case under advisement.

SUES ESTATE
Â¦ in his province by leading expeditions into
the Shenandoah Valley; that such a feat
was heralded abroad and made much of
brings sharply to our attention the essen
tially conservative and businesslike char
acter of English colonization. By 1750,
however, the English were preparing to
move across the mountains. The "back
country" along the eastern slopes of the
Alleghenies was peopled with a hardy folk
who did not shrink from danger and were
accustomed to privation* In the uplands
of Pennsylvania, Virginia and the Caro
linas lived the western pioneers of that
time. They were in some respects differ
ent from the settlers along the coast;
many of them were Scotch-Irish, a self
reliant, sturdy stock, fit instruments "for
undertaking this wilderness work." well
suited to the task of taking possession of
the interior region, the attractive valley
then almost uninhabited save by the red
men, but claimed in all its length and
breadth by the sovereign of France. They
were fearless men of action who seemed to
court danger and to love peril.
In considering the work of exploration
and discovery In the Middle West It is
well first to remember that almost noth
ing was done by the- English settlers of
the coast until there was the beginning
of what we might call economic demand.
The very first travelers who passed
through the region of Kentucky ana Ten
nessee wÂ«-e. so to speak, blazing the way
for actual settlement. - It Is also well to
notice that the eastern half of the Mis
sissippi Valley is divided into two not un
equal parts by the Ohio. The northern
portion contained French settlements at
an early day, but it received no English
settlers during the colonial period of our
history, the first regular settlement being
made at Marietta in 17SS, the year of the
adoption of the Fed'pral constitution. The
old Northwest, as we now call it, was es
sentially public domain and the pioneer
was more or less effectually protected In
the early days by Federal troops. I do
not mean to suggest that there were not
occasional Indian forays against the set
tlements north of the Ohio, but the coun
try was soon won by armies for the
peaceful occupation of the emisrrants
from the old States. So rapidly was this
region peopled when once the process
was begun that Ohio was ready for ad
mission into the TTnion in 1903, only fif
teen years after Marietta was bounded.
South of the Ohio explorations were made
and little settlements were planted be
fore the outbreak of the revolution.
There were only a few Indians in Ken
tucky and those lived along the banks of
the Mississippi. Kentucky was "the dark
and bloody ground," a belt of territory
lying between the Aigonqulns of the
North and the Cherokees and Creeks of
tho South. This was doubtless some ad
vantage to the whites that first settled
there, but as it was all exploration in the
country south of the Ohio was under
taken In the face of great dancer from
the Indians. Indeed, it Is this fact that
adds the romance and charm to the lives
of the brave men like Boone and Robert
son and Sevier, at once pisneer settlers
and explorers, leading on the van of Eng
lish civilization and driving slowly back
ward the most cruel foe. the most dan
gerous savage enemy that has resisted
the encroachment of the European any
where in the world. One is often at a
loss to account for the brave, untiring
energy with which these, men went on
and on, wtnnins new homen from the
wilderness. Kvery settlement in Ken
tucky and Trnnffsee had its tale of hor
ror, its stnry <>f unspeakable atrocities,
but In Fpite of disinter Hearing was add

midst of tV ,n*-!y primeval forest. For
over a thiw A a century the vigorous,
rtiRgrd mm were engaged in almost con
tinuul warfare.
By the middle of the eighteenth century,
a? I have iÂ«uid. the people along the
mountain eonttnes of the English colonies
were on the verge of passing over the
barrier. The colonial authorities were
anxious to gain a hold upon this territory
before It was fully garrisoned and de
fended by the French. A few enterprising
men had already begun to look to this
western country as fit ground for coloni
zation. 'Two companies were organizedâ
the Ohio company .and the Loyal Land
companyâ having for their object the oc
cupation of the country near the Upper
Ohio and Southwestern Virginia and Ken
tucky. .Dr. Thomas Walker, a Virginian,
was engaged by the Loyal Land Company
"to go to the westward in order to dis
cover a proper place for settlement." He
was the first to make an extensive ex
pedition-through the forest region south
of the Ohio. In March. 1750. he. with five
others, began a difficult and perilous jour
ney, passing over the mountains into Ken
tucky and spending four months in the
laborious task of threading the thick
forests, pushing his way through laurel

Soon after this Boone himself, with
twenty-seven of his nu-n, was captured.
He was taken to the old Indian town of
Chillicothe. Ohio, and held there in cap
tivity. Brave, patient, tactful, uncom
plaining, he wen the attachment of the
red me,n. who finally adopted him into
their tribe. At length he escaneu. start
ed straight through the untracked forest
for Boonesborougn. 1Z0 miles away, and
reached his home In four days, durlnj
which he ate only one meal.
Two years later Boone sold his farm In
North Carolina and with his family and
a band of forty men started once mow
for the West. His love of nature and his
zeal for adventure were too strong to suf
fer him to remain in comparative ease in
North Carolina. All went well for a time
but on entering the Cumberland Moun
tains they were attacked by Indians, wh;Â»
killed six of the white men. among them
Boone's eld-est son. This defeat discour
aged the emigrants and they returned to
the Clinch River, some forty miles from
the place of disaster. But disaster ha.l
no effect upon the intrepid Bonne, who
in a short time led a company of curvey
ors over the mountains down to tne falia
of the Ohio. His next undertaking was,
with the aid of thirty men. to mark out
and clear a trail for packhorses from tne
eastern settlements to the Kentucky
River. The work was dene at the sug
gestion of persons who had purchasÂ»-tl
land of the Indians in the new country.
This bridle-path waa the beginning of Cba
famous "wilderness road." over which In
the coming years immigration flowed int.*
the western country. It remains to-day a
striking testimony of Boone's remarkable
instinct for direction and skill Jn wood
craft. This also was a dangerous task.

of Boone's companions were killed. A fort

Foon came, cabins were built, blockhouse*
and palisades were ertcted and the bravo
little band prepared to hold Kentucky
against the red men. No words can exag
gerate the difficulty and the dangers of
the task. The savages, who were now In
league with the British and bitterly hos
tile to the American intruder, attacked
them in numbers or prowled about an^
shot men at their work, or fell upon them

other girls were captured by the Indians.

Through the whole of that summer and
the next autumn the tireless adventurer
wandered through the Kentucky forests,

the bison and other game with which the
country abounded. In December their
troubles began. Boone and one of his
companions were taken prisoners by the
Indians. Within a few days they escaped,
but on their return to their old camp they
found It abandoned by their friends. They
were then joined by two other huntery,
one of them Squire Boone, who had come
on the long journey to find his brother
and had succeeded In doing so in some
mysterious way known only to those who
have within them instinctive knowledge
of nature and know the secret3 of tho
forest. Again the party was attacked by
the Indians. The brothers .escaped, but
onÂ« of their companions was shot and
killed, "the first of the thousands of hu
man beings with whose lifeblood Ken
tucky was bought." Their remaining
companion now went back to North Caro
lina, and the- two brothers spent the win
ter together in the wilderness. In May it
was decided that Squire should return
through the trackless woods to the Yad
kin settlements, hundreds of miles away,
for supplies. Daniel was left for four
months all alone in the dreary forest,
without bread, salt or sugar, and with
only his own trusty rifle for a com
panion. "I confess," he saj-3. "I
never before was under greater neces
sity of exercising philosophy and forti
tude." During a large portion of the time
he was in danger from the Indians. In
the middle of the summer his brother re
turned. Fearing that the savages would
discover them, they went over into tho
valley of the Cumberland, and in the
spring of 1771 returned home. Boone had
spent two years In the wilderness, nn
small part of the time alone and over
half of the time accompanied only by hl.i
brother.

THE SAN ..-FRANCISCO CALL. TUESDAY, AUGUST 28, 1900.
By the middle of the eighteenth century
the French had made extensive explora
tions . Into the Interior of the continent.
For a hundred years and more the pio
neers of New Franceâ adventurers, sol
diers, restless fur traders, brave and pa
tient priestsâ had been making their way
through the Mississippi Valley. As early
as 1634 Nicollet was in Wisconsin and 111!-*
nois. Boon after this Marquette taught his
faith to tho Indians at the Falls of St.
Mary, and passed on even to the' farther
end of Lake Superior. In 1573 Joliet and
Marquette paddled their birchen canoes
up the Fox River and by way of the "Wis
consin came out on the broad bosom of
the Mississippi. In 16S2 La Salle, the great
est traveler and most adventurous spir
it of them all, floated down the Mississippi
to its mouth and took formal possession
of the great valley in the name of the
grand monarch of France. Before 17. r 0
daring explorers had traversed the north
ern plains and had entered the foothills
of the Rocky Mountains. Various settle
ments were made at convenient points â
Detroit. St. Louis and New Orleans were
founded. Basing his claims on . explora
tion and settlement, the King of France
claimed the heart of the continent.
The Kngllshmen In building up strong
and self-reliant colonies along the Atlantic
coast had done nothing In the way of ex
ploring the vast interior wilderness. Early
in the eighteenth century Governor Spots
wood of Virginia had caused no little stir
thickets or following Indian trails or tho
well-beaten roads made by the buffalo.
The most famous of all the early
pioneers of the great West was r>anlel
Boone, "the first hunter of Kentucky."
Standing out against the dreary back
ground of thjB wilderness we see In this
rugged pioneer a man of rare sweetness
of character, an Indian slayer who 'was
neither cruel nor revengeful; a bold, fear
less, intrepid fouI who was yet gentle,
kind and thoughtful. He was a tall man.
sinewy and strong, a sure shot, learned
in the lore of the forests and rejoicing
In dangers and hardships that would have
broken a less vigorous constitution. He
had the typical temperament of the West
ern backwoodsman. He wan self-reliant,
patient, simple, resolute and gifted with
unlimited powers of endurance. He moved
out into the Kentucky forests in obedi
ence to an inner impulse, a restless crav
inp for adventure which seems almost out
of keeping with his quiet, self-restrained
nature. He was born in Pennsylvania,
but spent his boyhood on tho banks of tlip
Yadkln. in North Carolina. At an early
date he passed ovf-r the mountains to
hunt. There is still standing in Kastern
Tennessee, near Booncs Creek, an old
beech tree on which can be read the fol
lowing inscription: "P. Boon cllled a bar
on tree In the year 1760."
In 1763 with four companions he made a
long expedition into the west. "X re
signed my domestic happiness for a time, '
he said. 'Jand left my family and peace
able habitation on the Yadkln River In
North Carolina to wander through th*Â»
wilderness of America in quest of tho
country of Kentucky." Such are th(*
words attributed to him by Filson. th*Â»
first historian of Kentucky: but we may
be sure that the simple Boone used no

New York Stock Market.
NEW TORK, Aug. 27.â There was some dis
position to sell stocks to-day and the market
showed a settling tendency throughout. Sugar
absorbed close to one-fourth of the day's total
dealings and its marked weakness doubtless j
hud some Â£yrr.j>athetic effect on the rest of the j
list. Ser.timent was affected also by the ap- i
jarer.t ala.r.docmer.t of any pool operations for I
a rise. Usless the weakness of sugar might
lÂ« called such, there vr&s no urgency in the j
liquidation, but there was an absence of buy- j
Irjf demand. The weakness of sugar found
no explanation i" any news announcement of
the day. TT.e approach of a Quarterly dividend Â¦
reriod gives opportunity for usual manipula
tion of the Â«ock and the room traders Jubi
lantly trail onto any movement in the specula
tion which premises an appreciable movement
ff prices. The stock got down to within 4 of
21S and closed only a. fraction above that on
the demand from the room shorts. Pressure
acair.st People's Ga.<= and Brooklyn Transit
Br-emf^d to I* coupled with the movement
against sugar in the early dealings and later
American Tobacco was forced down, but these
Ftooks exp*-ct the last showed a tendency to
recover, Brooklyn Transit rising above Satur
day's levcL Losses ?â¢xtended to a point or over I
liere and th^re la other s-tocks and New Jersey
Central fell 2'-Â«. London discounts hardened
to-dry, and while money conditions in Berlin
are for the moment easier, ex;^rt authorities
affirm that very heavy obligations will have to
l*Â» met in that market during the coming
month ar.d la-ter. Available funds In New
York continue apparently abundant, but the

CHICAGO, Aug. 27.â In wheat throughout the
cession there was a disposition to get on an
eve-n keel to float over the holiday to-morrow.
Trade was at all times quiet, but there was an
undertone of firmness pleasing to holders. Out.
side trade was lacking, which left the suppoct
of the market to local Interests. A moderate
amount of buying sufficed to do this. Liver
pool closed %d higher in face of the decline of
%Slc here Saturday; world's shipments were
less than the previous week by 1,132,000 bush
els,-and-the amount' on ocean passage fell off
1,360,000 bushels. Liverpool reported cargoes off
coast strong. The visible,' which had been ex
pected to show an increase of 1,500,000 bushels,
increased only 203,000 - bushels. Â¦ Northwestern
reports of the harvest of spring wheat were
still 4 freighted with the greatest despondency.
September opened at 73%@73%O and gradually
sold up to 74%c. closing firm ?Â» over Saturday
at 74VÂ»Â®"4 1 ic.

FROM A GROCERY WAGON
OAKLAND. Aus. 27.â Edward Parker,
a driver for Rouse & Co.. fell from the
seat of his wagon this morning and struck
on the back of his head. He was ren

picked up and hurried to the Receiving
Hospital. There it was at first supposed
that the man had suffered a fracture at
the bp?e of the skull and that his injuries
were serious.
This evening Parker recovered con
sciousness and was removed to his homo
3770 Grove street. His wife stated to the
hospital attendants that he was a victim
of epilepsy and that probably a suddea
fit caused him to fall. The injured man
sustained a slight concussion of the brain

MITT CASE
IS NOW BEFORE
SUPERIOR COURT
Hearing of Attorney Phil
brook's Petition by
Judge Sweeney.
His Charges of Conspiracy Are
Answered by Accused, Who
Strongly Denounce Dis
barred Practitioner.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
HIS Broadway. Aug. 2T.
The Merritt guardianship cases have
finally gone to trial. After many attempts
to secure a Judge favorable to both side-*
Horace W. PhUbrook'S petition was pre
sented this morning. before Judge Sweeney
of Shasta County, fitting In place oi
Judge Greene. Philnmok appeared in rtia
own behalf and the Merritis were repre
sented by Attorneys Emil Nusbaumer.
George W. Reed. F. A. l'.usley and G. L.
Frlck. ,
The greater part of the day waa de
voted to the hearing of KniU.rooks peti
tion and argument. Sltong language was
used on both sides and Judge Sweeney
was frequently obliged to quell riains
siorms. . Â¦
Phllbrook read his petition, wnich made
charges of fraud Â«n<t conspiracy against
the attorneys for Frederic* A. and Jam*-a
P. Merritt. Philbronk went deep Into the
history of the Merritt family from the
death of Dr. Samuel Merritt in 1SIÂ»>. He.
followed the old physician's million.*
through the hands of MrsÂ«. Catherine G;tr
celon to her many bcncScteriei and thÂ«
so-called "Knowles :m.>.t." which was the
custodian of the -?t.ite left to her
nephews, the Merritt hoys. The breaking
of the trust after the death of Â»I. fc.
Knowles. he declared, was the result of
a gigantic conspiracy to defraud the Mer
ritts, Fred A. and James P.. of the hall
mi'.llon dollar estate ittt to them by their
"I intend to show." continued Phllbrook.
"that for vears the Merrills have b*e:i
be=pt by all sorts of unprincipled peopie
wh.. were going after their property a.*
wolves would pursue a wounded bison.
The mental weakness of Frederick A. anÂ«l
James P. Merritt prevents them from
transacting business as they should. Con
sequently they have suffered losses^ t^
will their young children If they are not
placed under proper guardianship. Cer
tainly the parents of these children have
not demonstrated their fitness to act as
guardians because they are now engag^'l
in the very act of robbing their own off
spring."
Most of Phllbrooks argument was alorti;
these lines, he endeavoring to show tbu
court that the brothers had been cheated
and are constantly being swindled. He
referred sarcastically as a proof of their
incompetency to the small annuities be
cjtieathed la the two ntphews by Dr. Sam
uel Merritt.
"Frederick or Janus Merritt." said
Phllbrook. "would sign any paperâ even
a death warrantâ if influenced by the
proper persons."
With relation to the alleged conspiracy
to break the Knnwlea trust and loot the
Merrltts Phllbrook accused Attorney
George W. Reed of hcuiff the man who
laid the plans for the deal. He declared
that it was Heed who :aw to it that tht-ro
was a vacancy In the Superior bench of
this county and that A 1^. Frick was ap
pointed by Governor Markham to the va
cancy. The petitioner then attacked
Frick's judgment in the trust case an.l
charged him with being a coconspirator
with Reed, Nusbaumer and a long list of
others.
When Phllbrook concluded Attorney
Bosley read and filed an amended answer
to the petition. The document denied
specifically the charges made by the peti
tioner and ascribed his actions to a men
tal order and to his utter vlctousness.
: On behalf of the Merritts It was set forth
i that Philnrook was a stranger to them;
! that he had no legal right to guardian-
I ship, and that he was not a fit person
i to control the estate of the Merritt chll
1 dren.
In response to an allusion by Phi!
i brook to his disbarment as an attorney.
; Attorney Emil Nusbaumer arose with this
! motion:
"We move. If your Honor please, that
this tirade against the bench and bar of
this State be discontinued: also that ail
references to this man's disbarment be
left out."
Judge Sweeney ordered th*Â« petitioner to
refrain from making allusions to the
i judgments rendered by any courts and to
take care not to make slanderous state
ments.
In answering Philbrook's opening argu
ment Attorney Bosley offered on behalf
of his clients and counsel to admit cer
tain evidence with regard to the alleged
trust frauds, and after argument to sub
mit the case on briefs. He made this
suggestion, he said, to save. If possible,
a month's time. "If It Is proved that a
guardian is reeded for the children of
Frederick and James Merritt." he said.
"we are willing that one should be ap
pointed, but object at all times to the
selection of thi3 petitioner, who. we al
lege, is rot a fit and proper person. We
are surprised at the effrontery of this
man in this case. He comes here as an
utter stranger seeking to antagonize par
ents and children. His acknowledged
financial Insolvency Is sufficient ground to
prevent his appointment. There are plenty
of good, honest men who might be giTen
the guardianship."
When his associate hart concluded Emil
Nusbaumer spoke ln defense of ex-Judge
A. L. Frick. against whom Phllbrook'a
denunciations had been m^st bitter.
"Here Is a man who comes here with
a disordered nnd diseased, mind." saM
Mr. Nusbaumer, "and hurls accusations
about Indiscriminately. He has repeated
ly Insulted the bench and bar of the State
and makes specific charges against Judge
Frick. Either because of his own vlcious
nrss or because he Is urged on by tho
vlclousnesa of others, he attacks a deci
sion rendered by an honest and imp-trtlal
Judge.
"This man Phllhrook fcrts filed th's pet'
tion to harass the Merritt boys because
they refused hia demands for money. TnÂ«
document was not filed until a month
after he made a proposition to us to stay
proceedings If we would give him JGOO to
go to Washington and appear ln the
case before the United States Supreme
Court. The truth of the matter Is ..e
wanted to present his disbarment case
before the tribunal Instead of matters
concerning the Merritt Interests."
Judge tweenoy continued the case until
to-morrow morning for further argument.
He remarked that the only question, ap
parently, to be settled was whether the
minor children of the Merritt family were
possessed of property and whethjrr a
guardian was needed. That point settled,
it would then be determined If the peti
tioner was the proper person.

was transacted. The most Important pro
ceeding was the reading of reports cov
ering matters considered at the last meet
ing. It was announced that the Repub
lican County Committee of Santa Clara
County had adopted a resolution urging
the Republican State Convention to em
body in Its platform a resolution favoring
the purchase of the Big Basin and Cer
tain sections of redwood lands adjoining?
that natural park.
The members of the club feel en
couraged over the progress they arc mak
ing and feel confident that they will ac
complish their worthy object, namely, thÂ«j
salvation of the magnificent field of red
wood above mentioned. A committee waa
appointed to attend the State conventions
of the two parties and urge the adoption
of the proposed resolution.
Legend of the Blarney Stone.
The remains of the ancient Blarney cat
tle lie about four miles northwest of the
city of Cork. Ireland. Tradition makes it
the interesting scene of a siege earlv In
the seventeenth century, when the "lord
of the castle, who had been taken Dris
oner by the English, held out In his fort
ress for a long time by the adroit and
plausible promises that he would surren- Â¦
der. Whenever the critical time came '
however, he was always ready with a' !
good excuse. It was from his "inventive !
manner of putting off the besiegers by his I
soft. Insinuating speech that the term 1
blarney became a standard expression '

A 6 to the support. It wÂ»Â»re absurd
I" iitÂ»r.y that the company has been la
r.enianly weakened by the departure of
yi-s Ar.glin. Miss Dale and Mr. Walcott.
To begin with Mr. Stoddartâ a lovely old
gentleman wjo hug forgotten more about
acting: than I over knew, yet who has
also forgotten that the first duty of an
actor is to make the audience hear vhat
ht- has to say. If Mr. ISioddart would
only ohey the Injunction of the Irish ser
vant, "Fall out of line and look at your
k '.f. " he would realize that while he 1%
blffaly lookable he is also distinctly in
liudihle beyond the twelfth row. Mr. Mor
gan r.lays De Farge with that monotony
vhieh seems to be sottling into a manner
is-m with him; moreover, he neither dress
< â¢ nor looks the character and is therefore
quite unconvincing to any one who knows
vhat the keeper of a Saint Antolne cab
arÂ«-t rcaily is. 'Tin surely not too much to
expect an actor like Mr. Morgan to
acquire some knowledge of the social life
of the time and locality ln which his char
acter is posited, and to govern himself ac
crrdingrly. Mr. Hsrkins plays De Manette
with a coldness and precision that are the
<ract opposite cf the qualities given that
character in the book, thus compelling
many in the audience to make an uncom
fortable readjustment of ideas before they
< an beg-in to enjey hi3 work. This Is pure
ly a pity. As to Mr. Worthing'* lover.

best yet mace, it leaves much to be de-
E'.red. Its radical defect, it se<Â»ms to me.
i^ that it a^umes every one in the audi
euoe to be perfectly familiar with "A Tale
of Two Cities'"â a dangerous assumption
indeed. And even to those familiar with
t::at story, the dialogue in the prolojruw

The School Board's estimate for $2oO.OoO
was cut $63,000. It was recommended that
JnO.000 bo set aside for a manual training
school. The committee recommended
that bonds be issued for the permanent
paving of East Fourteenth street, from
Thirteenth to Twenty-fifth avenue: Tele

sixth street: San Pablo avenue, from
Fourteenth to Thirty-sixth street, and
Franklin street, from Water to Four

OAKLAND, Aug. 27.â Councilman Louis
Schaffer refused to go into executive ses
sion with the Council committee of the
whole to-night when a retirement was
taken to discuss the projected bond issue.
Stating his dislike to transact public busi
ness behind closed doors. Schaffer took
his hat and left the City Hall.

"Annexation would reduce our taxation,
the cost of operating our government and
would solve many of the problems which
now confront us in the tax levy. It is a
matter which rests with the people of
Alameda."
"Yes." declared Councilman Glrard, "if
Alameda could be induced to unite with
this city it would mean a big saving to us
all along the line. I would be in favor of
consolidation, hut it looks to me now as if
the sentiment of Alameda is against that
proposition."
Mayor Snow said:
"If the city of Oakland drslres to se
cure a harbor frontage which will be free
from entanglements, why not start a cam
paign to consolidate the cities of Oakland
and Abirrcdn. nnd thus give a continuous
line of frontage and greatly increase the
facilities for shipping?
"As it Is now," continued Counciluman
Mott. "Oakland has one side. Alarneda the
other side an.l the Government has the
center of the estuary. If the two cities
were united a comprehensive and com
plete scheme of harbor improvement could
be devised, and. I think, carried through
with good result."
Councilman Cuvelier declared that
would be a good solution of the problem
"The people of Oakland would have a
great deal to gain by such a move," he
said.
OAKLAND. Aug. 27.â To annex. the c!ty
of Alameda to Oakland for the purpose
of securing an undivided water frontage
on the estuary for Oakland is the propo
sition that was advanced to-night by City
Councilman Frank K. Mott, who is keenly
interested in the development of the har
bor facilities of this city. The matter
came up during a discussion concerning
the proposed bond issue and the act'on
which the Council would take concerning
the West Oakland wharf project. The
proposition was made by Councilman
Mott in this wise:

The Weekly Call
ONE DOLLAR PER YEAH
What. Is the policy, what are the aims
of this truculent Moslem? In a word, to
revive a great militant Mohammedan em-
pire In North and Central Africa, and. in-
cidentally, to turn out the two unbelieving
.powers. It is one of the qualifications of
a great leader to bide his' time. Senussi
has waited for a quarter of a century.â
St. Louis Republic. . :
There is reason to believe that at the
front In South Africa, among the Indian
bearers, there are several representatives'
of the new who have enlisted to
report upon the events of the war. The
most extraordinary feature of this con-
spiracy is that some of the members de-
clare that they have acquired the Btrang-e
secret of brain telegraphy, whereby they
are enabled to send messages over vast
distances.
As a military force his followers are In-
finitely superior to the Ill-armed Soudan-
ese whom the Anglo-Egyptian army de-
feated at the Atbara and Omdurman.
Twenty thousand Manlicher rifles, it is
said, have been bought at Liege, Belgium,
for the new Mahdi. Every one of these
weapons was landed at Tripoli and car-
ried on camel hack to Joffo., The Italian
"War Office -has lately been offering, for
sale a number of its disused field guns.
Several have been bought and. curiously
enough, shipped to Tripoli. Always Tripo-
li, for there the Sultan of Turkey reigns
supreme. *and that astute monarch is too
wise to run foul of the leader of 10.000.000
of the most reckless fanatics that Islam
ever enrolled.-!-.
Knsland is setting worked up over the
tidings that a new African Mahdi is
preparing his 10,000,000 followers for a
holy war. which may break out this year.
ThA* successor of him who fell In the
Soudan is Senussi,' arid he lives just now
in Jnffo, south of Tripoli. .This cloud on
the North African horizon lias been gath-
ering for some time. It is by no means
KÂ«m-.rally known that at any moment a
cyclone of Moslem fanaticism may sweep
over Egypt, Algeria and Tunis. This is
in the north. And further south in the
tragic continent, owing to the same cause,
civilization in Nlg-eria and the French
Soudan may be put back for another gen-
eration. The rapid expansion of a Mo-
hammedan secret society, with its in-
evitable Jehad, or holy war, among the
Arabic,. Berber and negroid races of the
western and central Soudan, Is a factor
ln current life in the Dark Continent
which at aqy moment may assume terri-
ble Importance.
The year that Gordon's life went out at
Khartoom (1SS5) the followers of Senussi
were estimated at about 3,000,000. Since
then the movement has grown so enor-
mously, that probably over 10.000,000 sons
of the prophet are sworn members of this
organization. Far away from the "White
Man's Africa," buried ln the heart of the
long sandy wastes that spread In endless
silence from Tripoli to Lake Tchad, are
being accumulated vast stores of the most
modern war material, without the possi-
bility of Interference by the Christian
powers most - concerned â England and
France.
Joffo, the headquarters of the new Mo-
hammedan Messiah, Is 500 miles west of
the Nile and about 700 from the North
African littoral. It lies a point clue south
of Tripoli and a little to the east of the
caravan route to Borncu.

Chinese prisons are loathsome with
filth, but as the Chinaman is accustomed
to dirt, their state does. not trouble him.
Petty offenders get a pint of old rice a
day if they are without other means of
support. Ordinarily, however, friends and
relatives nre expected to provide the food.
In winter they arc allowed a thick jacket,
and If sick they have medical treatment.
Warmed beds are provided for the aped
or infirm criminal in winter and cooling
drinks in summer.â London Mall.
Constables are periodically beaten if
they fall to produce prisoners. When war-
rants are Issued the policeman intrusted
with the warrant has thirty days in which
to produce his man. If he fails to pro-
duce him or arrests the wrong man he
incurs a penalty one degree le^s heavy
than that due to the real oflemfer. The
position of constable is not much sought
after in China. A certain Chinese law,
having reference to all manner of crimes,
often permits a criminal to escape pun-
ishment entirely. The Chine&e regard the
continuance of the succession of a family
as infinitely Importantâ more important,
indeed, than the punishment of a heinous
offense. Thus, If the last survivor of a
family kills hi? wife he escapes execution
on the ground that if he were killed there
would be no one left to worship the an-
cestral tablets! -.
The law, says Mr. Alabaster, distinctly
discourages "larking." and, indeed, games
generally. There is a case quoted in which
three men playing at horse managed to
tumble over in a heap on the roadway,
and one of them, falling on the brass-
bound pipe ln the pocket of him who lay-
undermost, was thereby killed. .The
Judges declined to allow the case to be
dealt with as one of misadventure and in-
sisted upon the smoker being sentenced
capitally.
.The most Ignominious of all penalties
in the Chinese code is slicing to pieces,
with extinction of the family. The con-
demned man is tied to a cross and by a
scries of painful cuts his body Is sliced
beyond recognition, the idea being to de-
stroy the future as well as the present
life of the offender. The Chinese believe
that the spirit of the dead man will ap-
pear as a collection of-little bitsâ a dread-
ful Ignominy.
Chinese law 1? a maze of contradictions
and complexities, but the magistrate who
fails to thread his way among them prop-
erly is severely punished, tor instance,
if a magistrate pronounces a sentence of
decapitation when it should have been
strangulation he receives a thrashing with
the bamboo, and the executioner who car-
ried out the magistrate's original sentence
shares the punishment with him.
Similar penalties await official careless-
ness of all kinds, but there is one partic-
ularly amusing rod in pickle for the erring
Judge. -If an offender is allowed to escape
the penalty due to his offense the un-
happy magistrate must himsalf suffer the
full penalty which he ought to have ex-
acted.
In a bad case of murder accessories may
not be visited with the death penalty..
Thus, If half a dozen persons 'commit the
crime, and it was uncertain who struck
the blow, the first striker is> held to be
the guilty one, and he alone is executed.
Again, should one of the accessories
chance to die in prison the sentence of the
man held responsible in the first place is
commuted.
Advocacy in the law courts, moreover,
is as dangerous as chivalry. It is re-
corded that a distinguished scholar, de-
sirous of shining as a barrister, was sen-
tenced to two years* imprisonment and
eighty strokes with the Chinese equivalent
oi' the birch for trying to coax from the
Judge ln a criminal case a verdict of
manslaughter instead of a verdict of mur-
der.
The apathy with which Chinese will
stand by and see offenses committed has
often been the subject of adverse criti-
cism among foreigners. Mr. Alabaster ex-
plains that It is due to fear of the law.
He cites a case wherein two ruffians at-
tempted to abduct another man's wife.
Hearing her cries i a gallant Chinaman
went to her assistance. The Â¦ real crimi-
nals appear to have escaped, but the gal-
lant rescuer got several years.
The same law sometimes finds a differ-
ent expression. A corporal found a sentry
asleep on duty and he hit him with a
watchman's pole so that the sentry died.
Now, the watchman's pole is a 'civil in-
strument. So the unhappy corporal re-
ceived 100 blows and three years' transpor-.
tation.
As in England, the law prevails; mili-
tary interference Is not tolerated. A serÂ«
geant who caught a man gambling had
him flogged on the spot. For i, this thai,
sergeant received 100 blows with *ie Bam-
boo himself and three years' transporta-
tion. The soldiers who flogged the gam-
bler under the sergeant's direction re-
ceived as their share ninety blows and two
years' transportation to the Chinese Bot-
any Bayâ a district on the borders of the
empire.
China has a very complete legal sys-
tem, the growth oi thousands oi years.
The first indication of law to be found in
Chinese tradition is the institution of mar-
riage about i)Â»e year 2S52 B. C.
A remarkable difficulty which the Chi-
nese Government has to contend with Is
pointed out In Mr. Alabaster's standard
work on Chinese criminal law. There are
three sets of lawsâ Tartar. Chinese and
Mohammedan â and when the codes clash
the result Is not unamuslng. There may
be three " criminals equally guilty of the
same offense and brought for trial to the
same court at the same time, with the re-
sult that- the criminal amenable to Tar-
tar law escapes with a whipping, the Mo-
hammedan Incurs the penalty of military
service and the prisoner tried under Chi-
nese law, besides being bamDooed, is
transported for life.

town. His death was due to heart failure.
A few days ago he returned from the

and expired In a feÂ»w minutes. The de

old at the time of his death. He was n,
native of Germany and came to this
country when about IS years of age.
For the first four years he made his
home in Suisun and then went to Birds
Landing to enter the employ of M. & A.
Dinkelspiel. dealers in general merchan
dise. About fourteen years ago he formej
a partnership with John Bird and they
bought the store of the Dinkelspiels and
have conducted the business ever since.
He was a member of Birds Landing: lodga

JONAS DINKELSPIEL, a younger
brother of Attorney Henry G. "W.
Dinkelspiel. committed suicide yes
terday in his room in the Winches
ter House, Third street, by shooting him
self through the head. The bullet passed
through his skull. The shot was heard by
employes in the house and the young man
was found lying on the floor of his room
with the blood pouring from a wound in
his right temple. He was taken to the
Receiving Hospital in the ambulance, but
Dr. Bunnell said his death was only a
question of a few hours. He died shortly
before 5 o'clock.
His brother, who wa3 promptly notified
of the attempt at suicide, hurried to the
hospital. He was overcome with emotion
and said the blow would kill his mother,
who Is in feeble health. He had been
shocked an hour or two earlier by the
news that his cousin, Morris Dinkelspiel,
had dropped dead at Collinsville, Solano
County. To his knowledge there was no
motive for hia brother's rash act. The
dead man had left a note addressed to
him. but it assigned no cause for ending
his life, simply bidding him and the family
good-byand requesting him to take charge
of his body and to break the news gently
to his mother.
Jonas Dinkelspiel was 25 years old and
unmarried. After the death of his father,

Jonas, who was a talented musician,
turned his attention to music. He went to
Seattle, where he -was employed In a piano
house, but returned to this city a few
months ago. He went to Nome expecting
to make a fortune, but came back ten
days ago thoroughly despondent and en
gaged a room at the Winchester House.
There is no woman kp*wn in the case and
he was not financially embarrassed, as hl3
relatives kept him well supplied with
money. The only cause that is surmised
is that he was despondent at his failure
to get along as well as his brothers. Ed-

The Autopsy Showed Beyond a Doubt
That the Woman Died of
. Alcoholism.
Coroner Cole said yesterday that he
could see no reason why an-Inquest should
be' held into the cause of death of Jeanne
La. Roche, who died at the Sutherland
Hotel on August 1. A searching autopsy
had been made by Morgue Surgeon Le
land. and he. found acute alcoholism to
have been the cause of death. There was
no evidence found to warrant the state
ment that had been made by certain in
terested parties that the woman had died
of septicaemia or blood poisoning. The
stomach had been analyzed by City Toxi
cologist Charles L. Morgan and City
Chemist Frank A. Green and no indica
tions of any poison were found.
In the face of such positive evictence
by the experts and In the total absence
of any evidence to contradict them, the
Coroner does not see any necessity for
the holdlnp of an inquest, his duty being
to determine the cause of death, and that
duty having been already performed. He
has every confidence in the integrity of
his chief deputy, P. J. McCormlck, and

most peculiar manner late in the after

she came to pay for the goods sha had

her purse had been taken. *

Bishop? John W. Hamilton and David
H. Moore attended the weekly meeting of
the Methodist Episcopal ministers yester
day morning- and delivered stirring ad
dresses to the large gathering of preach
ers and laymen. 'i he occasion was one of
great importance to the assemblage, as it
was the pastors' first opportunity to greet
the resident Bishop ana the distinguished
prelate who departs for the Orient to-day.
'lhe meeting was held In the assembly
room of the Young Men's Christian Asso
ciation building and the hall was inade
quate to accommodate the large attend-
Both prelates received hearty welcomes
and during the delivery of their speeches
they were constantly interrupted with
applause and fervent amens.
At the outset of his address Bishop
Moore spoke of the "forward move
ment" which is now going on in the
church. The subject of his talk, however,
Â¦fr-as the Orient. He gave it as his opinion
that there was a great future for the
Methodist Episcopal church in .eastern
Asia. He said that eastward the tide of
interest was going and as sure as there
was a God in the heaven the essential
principles of the Christian religion would
dominate. In part he said:
"I look for the time when we shall have
Chinese Methodism. What do we want
with American Methodism for China.
Japan and Korea? We want the princi
ples of John Wesley exemplified by a
great Oriental Methodism. I go forth
realizing in a way I never dreamed of the
solemn responsibility that will rest upon
me in China. If I were to go forth in my
own strength alone I would resign, but
believing that I will be sustained by the
Almighty. I will undertake the work
without "fear. The history of the church
has shown that it has chosen the weak
tn confound the mighty. I hope to know
r.t thing? through the inspiration of the
tupport that God has promised to those
who look to him for guidance, strength
and direction.

"I fully expected it would be my duty
to go to China and I anticipated going.
I found, however, that young men were
needed for war and old men for council.
So Bishop Moore, who is a young man
and full of exuberant spirits, was sent.
The choice was a wise one. He has been
at the front before and I would not be
surprised If you looked In his trunk you
would find his Winchester. He is a very
nroper man to go to Shanghai, and I
hope he will not have much fighting to
do when he reaches China. I have a feel
ing that he has a better mission and a
higher one. I am not a believer in war.
It is said that Grant himself never want
ed to talk about war and never wanted
to fight himself, and was most careful in
grapnic descriptions not to give his hor
rible experiences on the battlefield.- A
good soldier never wants to fight."
The speaker then dwe.lt on himself. He
said all who did not know him had jusi
to look at the newspapers and they would
enlighten them. â¢ Â«* '-
"1 must differ with Bishop Moore when
he says he looks for Japanese, Chinesu
and Korean Methodism. I believe that
the democracy of Methodism will encir
cle the world. You cannot expect to con
tinue the old form of government in
China. Japan and Korea. Things will
have to shape themselves. While we are
going to have Japanese, Chinese and Ko
rean Methodism, it will be Impregnated
with the spirit of all our American
preachers.
"I think the best way for us to carry on
our work at home and abroad is to have
the great force centered here at home to
vitalize the world. I believe that the
Methodist Kplscopal church is able to run
its household, furnish it. own its own ef
fects and run itself successfully, as well
as any other denomination. Other denom
inations may help us. and we will recipro
cate by helping them.
San Francisco's Opportunity.
"San Francisco Is a coming capital of a
coming kingdom. Just now all the world
is looking through your telescope, and
they will look upon China through this
State. You are going to open up great
opportunities for renewing work in that
whole Eastern world, and in order to do it
you will have to grow. You will have
more people. You have the fruit to feed
them and you have. the cereals, and people
are coming here. I have applications
enough in my satchel to fill all the ap
pointments. I have had friends say to me,
Â¦Hamilton, I am ready to leave; I will go
with you. I would like to come.' There
is no opportunity on the continent like the
opportunity California has to-day. Meth
odism must be as big. as California. You
are the biggest church in the whole coun
try. Really, there is nothing so dangerous
as* a big thing in a little country. I am
looking for big men among you. The
great trouble with California has been
that California has not been big enough
to comprehend the work in the Orient.
The trouble has been you have had nar
row views. "You always think the Anglo-
Saxon Is 'It.' I don't think God has
'banked' everything on. the Anglo-Saxon.
"So I want big men in California. If you
have not got them I will send for them.
We will get them, and I want them. I
want your 'God bless you' to go with
Bishop Moore, and let us pray that he will
return from Eastern Asia with â¢ his
'shields' for work he has well accom
plished. When I am at home come and
pee me. At present I will meet you on
the street, but soon .1 will have a home,
and I want to feel that your home is mine
and my home is yours. Let. us come to
gether and forget all titles, and simply be
together as Methodist brethren.".
After the singing of an appropriate
hymn and the delivery by Chancellor Day
of a prayer. Rev. Dr. Harris delivered a
short but feeling speech, which he direct
ed to Bishop Mcore. It was an appeal to
him to lend his great aid to the Japanese.
The speaker dwelt at length on the work
in Japan. The singing of the Doxology
closed the interesting meeting and the
Bishops were greeted by the pastors. All
who shook hands with Bishop Moore left
a coin in his palm to be devoted to the
building of a church In the Orient.
Bishop Hamilton Speaks.
and as soon as the propellers of the Hong
kong Jlaru bring me to the scene I will
call a general conference of the mission
aries in Shanghai. After the counsel of
war with the brave men who are upon
the ground, we shall go forward as God
shall give us direction and help. Of
course, there are indemnities to be se
cured from the Chinese Government and
I have no doubt that the money will' be
paid. It will take a considerable time to
achieve this and you can help us here at
home by loaning our missionaries a suffi
cient sum of money to carry on their
work. I am glad to meet you all. I am
glad you have Bishop Hamilton with
you."
The speaker was about to pay a tribute
to his brother Bishop, when he stopped,
and gazing around the room asked if
Bishop Hamilton was present. His query
being answered In the affirmative and his
eyes having been directed to where, the
Bishop was seated. Dr. Moore held out
his hand Invitingly to him and said,
"Well. John, speak for yourself." When
the laughter ajid applause had subsided.
Rev. Dr. Dllle, president of the organiza
tion, escorted Bishop Hamilton to the
platform- At the outset of his address
Bishop Hamilton apologized for being
late. He said he had been downtown
hunting for a lost trunk, which contained
his certificate of ordination and all the
work of the conference. In part he said:
mATTHEW GERBER, a baker 21
years of age, shot himself with
the intention of committing sui
cide in a German lodging-house
at â¬21 California street early last evening.
The haker used tw - o revolvers fimilar In
caliber arid pattern, holding one at either
temple. The cartridge :n one pistol failed
to explode, but the bullet from the other
tore It5 way through his head, passing
cut on the right side. No reason thus far
has be*Â»n assigned for the young man's
rash act, except that it might have been
caused over trouble that he had with his
employer In Oakland recently.
Gerber came to this city from Schles
rtadt, Germany, when a youth. Two
years ago he visited Europe and returned
to this citv about three weeks ago.
Through the efforts of his brother, who
resides at 1954 Fourth street, he secure!
employment in Oakland and worked there
x:ntil a. couple of days ago. A dispute
with his employer caused him to leave
ar.d he had been out of work since,
though by no means out of funds or a
chance of pecurinp employment elsewhere.
The baker remained about the lodging
riouse where he shot himself most of yes

Bays Gerber had been drinking a little.
but took no liquor in his house. About S
o'clock last evening he heard what he be
lieved to be the report of a pistol in Ger
ber's room, and hastened to it. He found
the door locked and pot no response when
he knocked. The door was forced and a
tragic slfrht greeted the proprietor's gaze.
Gerber was seated on the floor, his back
supported by the bed. Close to him were
two revolvers, and blood was oozing from
an ugly wound in his head.
Policemen Phillips and Attrldge were
soon on the scene and found that life was
not extinct, although the man seemed to
be breathing his last. They summoned an
ambulance ani Gerber was conveyed to
the City Receiving Hospital. Investiga
tion showed that the revolvers used were
of an old make and almost tho same. The
cartridges were of rimrire, and the one in
the revolver held in the right hand had
been dented by the trigger but failed to
explode.
Gerber had been a regular attendant at
a dancing academy every week. He
danced last Sunday night and went home
after what was apparently an evening of
pleasure for him. His friends claim that
he always had plenty of money, and do
not know of any love affair that he was
tangled up In.
Gerber died at the city Receiving Hos
pital at 1:30 o'clock this morning.
This place Is a leper establishment in the
Sandwich Island and in the United States' do
main, and I have no doubt this could be done
with the help of the United States court. I
would like the life sentence that Is passed upon
me to be changed to Molokaii. This. I belelve,
should be satisfactory to the people of Cali
fornia. If this Is granted to me I promise that
I will not complain and will not try to make
any appeal of any kind. I am well aware of
what I will see there. Good many years a^o
when I was In the harbor of Honolulu I saw
over ninety of these poor lepers leave that place
for a leper settlement of Molokaii and I had
a good chance to see all the horrors of that
Krfat plague- Hoping that my petition will be
granted so that I may be able to do a little
cood and thereby earn the salvation of my
soul by helping suffering humanity, I hope that
this motion will be approved by all the popu
lation of the United States and will be granted
to me it Is my prayer to this court.
It is also my intention to ask His Grace Arch
bishop Riordan to help me to get this favor
granted to me, as the supervision of this place
To the Honorable Frank H. Dunne, Judge of
Superior Court No. Sixâ Your Honor: At this
time I wlshe to make a reauest that was never
made before and that may never be made again
by any oije else after this. It may look strange
to you and no doubt you will see that it comes
from a strange mind. During my detention
he're In the County Jail I have had plenty of
time to review my past life, and as It has not
been a very useful one to humanity at large, I
would like to change it In this way. I would
like to be sent to the island of Molokaii to take
care of the multitude of lepers that are there.

Tanner has communicated his wish to
spend his last years among the lepers of
Molokal, and It may be, as he says, an
effort on his part to labor for the salva
tion of his soul. Tanner's communication
reads:
BROADWAY JAIL. Aug. 20, 1900.
To live amonp the unclean of Molokal
and there to die. perhaps gnarled and
wasted by the dread leprosy, that when
his life's story Is told there may be one
chapter of pood and sacrifice, is the wish,
the prayer, of George Louis Tanner, ad-
Judged guilty of the murder of Deputy
Sheriff Brown and Fannie Barnes and
condemned to a life of penal servitude
within the walls of Folsom prison. Wheth
er or not remorse has laid 'Its grasp upon
this murderer's mind, or â¢whether In his
offer of sacrifice he sees a ray of hope
for ultimate liberty. Is problematical. Per
haps a free life, limited though Its years
will be, with unclean death Its Inevitable
end. Is preferable to him to those many
years more of health and strength behind
the bars of a prison.
