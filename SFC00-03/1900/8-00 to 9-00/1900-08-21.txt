LONDON, Aug. 21, 3:55 a. m.â Owing probably to the
Peking wire being cut, little news of conditions in the
Chinese capital has come through this morning. What
has reached London indicates that the allies are in need of rein
forcements. The commander of the Italian cruiser Fieramosea
telegraphs from Taku, according to the Rome correspondent of
the Daily Mail, that very urgent requests were coming from Pe
king on Saturday for the immediate dispatch of further troops,
and that in answer to these 400 Italian marines were sent)off

The Japanese Minister in London is said to have' received
a telegram last evening announcing that subsequent to the entry
into Peking a Japanese detachment went to the imperial palace
to afford whatever protection was necesssary. The enemy was
in strength, and fighting was still proceeding when the message
was sent to Tokio. The main body of the Japanese was then at
the An-Ting-Men gate, in the Tartar City, with headquarters at
the Japanese legation.
Reports of the presence of the Empress Dowager are still
contradictory, but General Yung Lu, on the authority of the
Shanghai correspondent of the Standard, is announced to be a
prisoner, by order of the Empress, in the imperial palace.
"This, perhaps," says the correspondent, "is a good thing,
as detention in the capital will enable him to negotiate with the
allies' commander, which he would do as Prince Tuan's enemy."
The Chinese Minister in London, Sir Chih Chen Lo Feng
Luh, on being asked as to the whereabouts of the Empress
Dowager and Emperor, replied:
"They have gone westward to the old capital, Sian-Fu, and
I think they are quite safe there."
Serious trouble is now threatened in the neighborhood of
Canton. The Americans at Swatow, according to the Daily
Chronicle's Shanghai correspondent, have applied for a warship
in consequence of serious rioting, and the Hongkong corre
spondent of the Daily Mail says that a warship is on the way
there now.
Queen Victoria has sent the following message to the com
mandant of marines at Peking:
"I thank God that you and those under your command
have been rescued from your perilous situation. With my peo
ple. I have waited with the deepest anxiety for good news of
vour safety and the happy termination of your heroic and pro
longed defense. I grieve for the losses and sufferings experi
enced by the besieged."
\ Japanese warship has left Yokohama for Shanghai, ac
cording to the Daily Mail, to land troops and to protect Japan
ese subjects The Daily Mail also announces that Germany will
land a detachment at Shanghai. Further Yokohama advices to
the same paper declare that Germany and Russia are objects of
â¢lUtrust to the Japanese press, which urges that Japan, having
borne the chief burden of the operations, must see to it that the
future of China is not determined merely by the pleasure of the
western powers "It is felt." says the correspondent, "that de
termined action on the part of Great Britain, the United States
and Japan will avert any danger arising from. the ambition of
continental Europe."
The semi-official organs say that if occasion arises. Japan
can send 50.000 troops on short notice, and that if the powers
are inclined to play a selfish game, special measures will be

Reinforcements for Allies
Italian Marines Are Rushed
From Taku to Peking.
Reports From the Chinese Capital Con
cerning the Empress Dowager Are
Conflicting, but It Seems Certain She
Has Fled to Sian-Fu.
PiEKING, Friday, Aug. 17, via Shanghai, Aug. 20.â Contrary to the agreement of the allied commanders,
the Russians advanced and occupied the first door of the east gate early in the morning of the 14th
(Tuesday), but failed to force the second door. At 2 o'clock on the afternoon of the 14th the British and
Americans entered the gate near the legations and met with only slight resistance. The Japanese met
a more serious opposition at the upper east gate all day. At midnight of the 14th they blew up the gate and en
tered the city.- Many Chinese were killed. The people in the legations were well, but somewhat starved. Min
ister Conger said:
"They tried to annihilate us the day before you got in. Prince Ching, president of the Tsung li Yamen,
sent word that his officers had received orders to cease firing on us under pain of death. At 7 o'clock in the
evening of the same day the Chinese opened fire and this continued all day.
The attitude ' which the International forces will observe toward the Empercr
and Empress Dowager Is understood to have received official consideration amor..:?
the powers, resulting, from a' request by the Southern Viceroys that no personal
indignity be shown to China's "rulers". In response to this it Is quite generally
understood that there will be no personal Indignity to the Emperor and Em
press Dowager, not because it Is felt that there Is any special consideration due
them, but because China would be precipitated Into a chaotic condition If tho
responsible heads of the empire lost their functions. In view of the general dt
slrc of this Government and the others concerned to keep China Intact the de
position among ofllclals Is toward refraining from any personal indignities tD
Â»the Chinese rulers. It develops In this connection that all of the powers re
cently rejected the proposition of the Consuls at Tientsin to destroy the tomb*
of the Ming dynasty. The proposed destruction was a threat- held out to tba
Chinese in. the hope of bringing them to terms. But the powers rejected the pro
.posal and thus gave: significant evidence that anything calculated to give per
sonal affront or indignity to the Chinese was not part of the present campaism.
These several dispatches from aiff srent sources establish clearly that the im
perial palace and grounds were under 3iese. But not one of the dispatches Â»
clear as to how late this condition of affairs existed. The Fowler dispatch is
the latest to be received and is dated the 20th, but probably that is the datrf on
which- it left Tientsin. The Japanese dispatch also refers to the Chinese lakiss
refuge in the imperial palace on the 13th, but does not bring the situation bt
yond that day. So that the latest Information, while showing the Imperial city
surrounded, does not disclose the issue of this situation nor how long it ha.<
continued. . â¢
To-day's dispatches seem to make clear that the Emperor ard the Empress
Dowager have made their escape from Peking and that about the only present
service of the imperial palace and grounds is an asylum In which the demoral
ized Chinese soldiers are making a last stand. The Japanese legation's advlcc-i
to-day showed that the banners of the Imperial cortege were seen leaving Peking
on the 12th. and that probably the Empress Dowager as well as the Emporor
had left the city. Consul General Good now advised the State Department that
he had information from Chinese sources that the Empress Dowager had Ie:t
Peking.
The situation at Peking was made clearer to-day from many sources. ' The
latest advice appears that from Consul Fowler at Chefu, repeating a dtspatch
received from Consul Ragsdale at Tientsin. The latter reports "Chinese troops
surrounded in palace grounds." The Japanese legation received a dispatch of Qka
same general tenor, but more In detail, stating that the Chinese troops re
treated on the 15th within the Imperial palace and that they were surrounded
there by the Japanese troops.
Admiral Remey also transmitted an authentic report from Peking on the
loth saying: "Troops moving on the Imperial city."
WASHINGTON, Aup. 20.â The American reply to China's latest appeal for
a cessation of hostilities, received to-day from LI Hung Chang, has not
yet been made known, and it is likely that the matter will be one of the
main subjects of consideration at the Cabinet meeting to-morrow, liut
there is reason to believe that the overtures will in effect be rejected
on the ground that the conditions laid down in the American note of August 12
have not been complied with, and unless complied with the Government's course
must proceed without reference to China's* appeal for a halt in the proceedings.
The dispatch of August 12 said specifically that the United States was ready to
enter Into an agreement between the powers and the Chinese Government for a
cessation of hostilities on condition that the relief forces should be permitted "to
enter Peking unmolested" and escort the legationers therefrom under such cir
cumstances as the general commanding might lay down. f?ut up to the present
time th^re is no evidence that the allied forces are unmolested at Peking or have
received the sanction of the Imperial Government to convey the legatlonera to
Tientsin without further troubles under the conditions laid down by the com
manding general. On the contrary, aJl of the dispatches indicate that the allies
a"re meeting with stubborn resistance and there is an entire lack of compliance
with the conditions laid down by the United States in its dispatch of August
12. As stated, however, the Government has given no authoritative state
ment of its purpose in reply to China's application of to-day and there Is still
a slight chance that complete compliance with the demands of August 12 may
be announced in the Peking dispatches before the flnr determination on the
reply Is made. But the disposition is clearly in the lines Indicated.
China's last application for peace negotiations was received early to-day at
the Chinese Legation and was transmitted by Mr. Wu to the State Depart
menf. Secretaries Hay and Root were out of the city, but Acting Stcretary
of State Adee went over the subject with the President. Earl Li's request Is
that the Ur. :ed States shall name Minister Conger or some other official to act
as peace envoy for the cessation of hostilities. Li expressed his wUfogBeas to
go to such point as the powers may desire and under the intimations made it
is thought that Peking or Tientsin would be selected for the negotiations. The
Chinese envoy proposed no terms as to the withdrawal of troops and made no
other suggestions as to what was to come before the commission, his sole an
xiety being to secure the cessation of hostilities.
The application is understood also to have been made to the powers in the
hope that If all would name a commissioner there would be a general council
of peace between Li Hung Chang on the one hand and the several representa
tives of the nations on the other. Aside from the fact that the conditions on
August 12 have not been complied with by China, it la probable that this Govern
ment would desire to take sufficient time to learn what the other powers Intend
doing on the 'same line, as all are acting in unison. Moreover there are some
unexplained features of Li Hung Chang's application, one of them being that
while he asks the allies to cease hostilities he gives no assurance that he has me
power to make the Chinese army and the rebellious Boxers cease their hostili
ties.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 20.â The Chinese Government through
Li Hung Chang has made application to the United States
for the appointment of Minister Conger or some other Amer
ican official with authority to open negotiations for the establish
ment of peace and for fixing definite terms for the settlement of the
present trouble. The application came to the Chinese Minister to-day
and was taken by him to the.State Department. Li Hung Chang's
application for the appointment of a Peace Commissioner expresses
willingness to conduct the negotiations at a point desired by the
powers, and it is expected that this will be Peking or Tientsin. A
similar application has been made by Earl Li to all of the powers
. interested. 7 His suggestion of Minister Conger as the Commissioner
is based on the idea that as Minister Conger has been rescued he
has now the opportunity to proceed to the point where the negotia
tions will be held and conduct them. The application does not sug
gest any particular terms nor does J it ask for the withdrawal of
troops. It requests that the negotiations shall be for the purpose of
bringing about a cessation of hostilities.
First Condition That the Relief Forces Be
Permitted to Enter Peking Unmolested
Not Complied With and America Will
Refuse to Act.
Chinese Government Through
Li Hung Chang Again Ap
peals for Cessation of Hostili
ties and Restoration of Peace.
In an interview Sir Claude Macdonald, the British Minister, states: "The Chinese broke every engage
ment with the foreign Ministers. There is no truth in the story that the imperial palace supplied the legation
'with food. They sent vegetables, which were refused. The total casualties during the siege of the legations
were sixty-seven killed and one hundred and twenty wounded."

"If the relieving 1 column had not arrived when it did we should probably have succumbed.
The whole movement is purely a governmental one. The Boxers are only a pretense, having no guns.
The confidential adviser of the Empress was the leader of the imperial troops here. In eleven days over
2000 shells fell among us. The American marines, under Captain Myers, held the position on the wall
throughout the siege. Upon the allies passing the wall the Chinese retreated. The imperial family left four
days ago for Shensi province."

GENERAL GORDON
STRIKES BACK
AT HIS CRITICS
It Is Expected to Prove by Ex-Gov
ernor Taylor and Other Absent
Witnesses That the Sten
ographer Is Innocent.
GEORGETOWN. Ky., Aug. 20.â The de
fense this afternoon filed a motion for a
rontinuance until the October term In the
rase of Henry H. Youtsey. the Auditor a
>oung stenographer, who waÂ« inaicted
es one of the principals in the Goebel
murder. The motion is based on the ill
ness of the defendant, supported by the
feffldaviTs of two physicians, of the illness
of his attorneys and also the absence of a
iargc number of important witnesses. An
efhdavit was also filed by his counsel
ftating that subpenas had been issued and
returned unserved in the cases of a num.
ir-r who were desired as witneses, and the
flcfendant makes affidavit as to what he
expects to prove Y>r them. By ex-Governor
\Y. S. Taylor. Charles Kinley. W. J. Da
tidson and R. N. Miller, all of whom are
out of the State, he says he will prove
that he was in the executive's office solely
for protecting the building and occupants
from the expected riot- He says that
Taylor and Miller will testify that upon
entering the executive office "immediately
efter the shooting Youtsey did trot say
that Goebel had been killed, but that he
Sid not know what had happened. That
:'harl*>s Flnley will testify that there was
cut one key to the Sacretary of State's of
fice, and that Mrs. C. E. Mason will tes
tify that she Faw the defendant walk up
â¢he steps to the east door of the building
io soon after the shooting that he could
not have been engaged In it. That ex-
Soveroor Bradley will say he never talked
with W. II. Culton or anybody else re
tarding the rumor that Youtsey contem
plated killing Gofbel.
The court did not pass directly upon the
motion for a continuance, but said that
only one of the grounds set up in the af-
Sdavit was to be consideredâ that of the
Ulnefis of the defendant. He therefore
postponed the trial until next Thursday
morning, at which time it would be de
lermlned whether Youtsey would be able

IN BEHALF OF
YOUNG YOUTSEY
Ti t EW YORK, Aug. 20.â Senator Ma-
J\ I son of Illinois has recently criti
Â¦ \i elzed Secretary of State Hay be-
I \ cause of the provisional boundary
which has been run through :lie
disputed territory In Alaska. Fault is
found with the Secretary for having
"yielded to Great Britain" and for having
"ceded to Canada" territory belonging to
the United States. A correspondent of
the New York HeraM called Secretary
Hay's attention to this criticism and re
quested him to make a statement in hi?
own behalf of the attitude of this Govern
ment and the exact effect of the provision
al boundary. This he declined to do. but
discussed the entire matter with freedom
and without any show of Impatience.
As a result of his explanalion it can be
stated that there has been no cession of
territory to Canada under the provisional
boundary, just completed in accordance
with the terms of the modus vlvendl, and'
there can be none. Nor has anything been
said, done or agreed to by the representa
tives of the United States before, during
or since the location of the provisional
boundary to weaken the claim of tiie
United State3. It is a mere temporary
line devised for the practical working of
the two governments in their administra
tionâpolicing, collecting of tariff duties,
etc.â of the territory, until the boundary
Is finally determined. The modus vivendl
was entered into because of the refusal
of the Canadian Commissioners to accept
any settlement or adjustment except one
that this Government felt would deprive
""" Special Dispatch to The Call.
j Arbitration was offered, but Secretary
Hay refused on the ground that it would
have meant an admission that there was
a flaw in the contention of the United
States. , Meanwhile things were Jn a poor
state. This Government sent troops to
Dyea and* Skaguay. Canada had mounted
police in both places. Canadian police
were on the streets of Dyea and Skaguay
dally and In one of the places Canada
had a Government office. It was a sort
of no man's land, or, rather, a land with
a dual government. Disputes were con-
Cnnnda wanted to compromise and sug
gested its willingness tÂ» abandon its
claim to Dyea and Skaguuy if the United
States would only permit it to have Pyra
mid Harbor, so that it could have a tidal
entry to the Yukon region. The United
States held that compromise was out of
the Question, as its boundary line was
the correct one.
The United States contended for the
line on all the recent maps, which fol
lowed the winding or sinuosities of the
coast, put the Lynn Canal in American
territory, and gave to the United States
Dyea. Skaguay and Porcupine Creek. The
United States felt that it had a substan
tial case and could hoi i its claim.
The contention of Canada was that tho
boundary followed tho continental coast
line ten marine leagues inland, jumping
from headland to headland. This would
have given them control of all water ac
cess to the gold fields by the Dalton trail.

all the Lynn Canal and of Dyea and

sound title.
When the extent of concessions made
by Canada and the United States is com
pared, it is discovered that Canada has
conceded more than 100 miles and the
United States not more than ten miles,
and nothing that the United States has
done has vitiated or weakened its claim,
which is even now being pressed. *
In the drawing of this line Canada was
put entirely out of the Lynn Canal:
driven away from Pyramid Harbor, from
Dyea and Skaguay. The Indian town of
Klukwan, which Canada claimed, was
taken in as American territory. Instead
of having a tidewater port of entry, Can
ada was deprived of even canal naviga
tion into the Klondike.

the" enforcement of law or the mainte
nance of order might arise at any hour.
Therefore, to remove the danger of con
flict the modus Vivendi was entered into.
It provided for a line to be fixed by an
officer of the United States Coast Survey
and a Canadian astronomer at each of
the points at which the disputed country
could be entered. ThuS it was not a com
plete or continuous line from Yukon or
Canadian territory on the east to United
States territory on the west, but lines in
dicated by monuments at the White River
Pass, the Chilcoot Pass and along the
Kleheeni or Klehiril River anU Porcupine
Creek, north of the Indian village of
Klukwan, these lines only being drawn at
places where access could be had Into the
country beyond. It was to be merely a
temporary working boundary for the time
being, so that each country should know
where it could exercise Its authgrlty so
long as the arrangement lasted.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 20.â Reports from
Shanghai are so confusing that the Presi

truth is. Even Consul General Goodnow,
who is usually accurate, has sent contra
dictory reports as to the situation and in
tentions of the powers, indicating, it is be
lieved, that so many reports are put In
circulation there that he is unaWe to learn
the truth. It Is believed that equally con

CONFUSING REPORTS
COME FROM SHANGHAI
In giving this letter out for publication
the Russian embassy wishes it understood
that little importance is attributed to the
effect of the stories reflecting upon the
Russian troops. Were it not that the lady
concerned la desirous of correcting the
false reports no notice would be taken of
them, as the facts themselves are the best
refutation of the sensational canards pub
lished, with the obvious purpose of preju
dicing the American press and people
against the Russians.
of the atrocities committed by the Rus
sian soldiers. I wish to deny these state
ments in full, and as the account has been
copied into many Eastern papers it has
perhaps' come to your notice. I feel that
I at least must tell you how false it ah is.
In fact, I can from my own experience
during those terrible days of the siege of
Tientsin speak only in the highest terms
of praise of the Russian soldiers, who un
doubtedly saved our lives on more than
one occasion."

end was in turn shot dead by Harry Dill
ingham, the Sheriffs son. Before he was
cornered by the Sheriff's posse, Harring
ton held up the clerk in a general store
at the point of his revolver and exchanged
phots with the clerk, firing into a crowd
of spectators. Harrington's 12-year-old
daughter was a forced Â¦witness of the dif
ferent stages of the tragedy.
The physician took her with him in his
buggy pp he went from place to place on
his Uloody errand.
Saturday night Harrington quarreled
with his wife and drove tter from him,
threatening her life. He had had words
â¢with James Wallace over a line fence and
had been on a protracted spree. Mrs.
Harrington had not returned home trTls
morning and Harrington, repairing to
Wallace's horae. demanded to know where
the could be found. Wallace professed to
hai'e no knowledge of her whereabouts,
whereat Harrington whipped out a re
volver and shot him twice, once in the
head and once through the heart. Leav
ing the victim as he lay, Harrington
drove half a mile to the home of Mrs.
William Wallace and again demanded to
know of his wife. On Mrs. Wallace's
answering that she knew nothing of Mrs.
Jiarringxon. the physician shot her dead
before she could make an outcry.

Harrington drove Immediately to
Leaventvorth, taking his little girl with
him. The Wallaces were alone and no
body gave chase. At Leavenworth Har
rington appeared calm and collected. He
purchased some cartridges for his re
volver and a 41-caliber rifle and ammuni
tion for it. remarking to the proprietor
as he left: *"I have an order for the
cartridges in the store at Farley, and as
I am going home I might as well take
them."
As Harrington retraced his steps the
liquor and *he thoughts of his crime mad
dened him. Reaching Farley be entered
"William Wehe's general store and ds
mande-i some money of the clerk In
charge.
"I have only S3 and cannot let you have
that." said the clerk.
"Yes you can. for I will pay It back,"
replied Harrington.
The clerk still refused and Harrington
drew a revolver and demanded the money.
There wore a dozen men in the store, but
none made a move to interfere. The clerk
turned over the money and Harrington
Ftarted to leave the store. As he did so
the clerk seized a revolver and fired one
phot at him. It went amiss and Harring
ton, turning quickly, emptied his re
volver in the direction of the crowd.
Non<> of the shots took effect, but they
(sufficed to keep the crowd at bay. and
Harrington sauntered toward the door.
Mad Career Ended.

terrific windstorm struck the city
this afternoon. The storm came
very suddenly from the north.
Eight large buildings were completely
wrecked and 200 small houses were blown
down. The loss will be more than $300,000.
At noon It was as dark as night and in
tensely hot. A few moments before 1
o'clock the storm broke, Increasing in force
until a tornado was blowing. Person3
were knocked down and fences and signs
hurled hundreds of feet. The storm raged
for some minutes and passed off to the
south. The storm started in the western
part of the city, near the cemetery, and
swept down on to the south side ana orr
into the lake. It was two miles wide and
wrecked everything in its path. It was all
over in ten minutes, although it seemed
hours to the panic stricken people. Tha

stepped between the wire, then reached
back for the gun and drew it between the
wires toward him. Evidently the trigger
was up and had caught on the wire
barbs and the gun was discharged, the

Â¦ The State Board of Equalization met to
night and It was expected by some of the
members that the matter of citing coun
ties to show cause why their assessments
should not be .increased would be deter
mined. v Â»
State Controller Colgan was In favor of
accepting the figures reported by the vari
ous Auditors to the State Board. Equal
izer. Toland was in favor of the board
adopting a motion not to cite any of the
counties, which would give the Assessors
an opportunity to give their reasons why
their assessments should not be increased
before the tax rate is fixed.
During a discussion between Equalizers
Beamex and L. H. Brown on the subject
Beamer said that the assessment rolls of
the counties are not as equal as they
should be and that they would never be
so as long as the board continues in its
present policy. He said that If the board
accepts Just what the Assessors bring In
the rolls of the different counties will
never be equal. , He said that San Fran-
Cisco's roll, as compared with the rolls
of forty other -counties, was a shame
faced proposition.
State Controller Colgan changed his
motion to agree with the views of Toland.
but before a vote was taken Beamer
moved that the board take a recess un
til 10 o'clock to-morrow morning, which
prevailed. - _
After the board -had adjourned Equal
izer .. L.-H. Brown ,,sald that the amount
necessary to be rfclsed for the present
fiscal year, would be $5,520,997 and that the
tax. levy would probably amount to about
47.8 cents on the $100 and 2 cents for the

Marln's Energetic Sheriff Has
Abandoned King's Trail,
but Says the Slayer
Will Be Caught.
Special Dispatch to The CaJl.
SAN RAFAEL, Aug. 20.â After nearly
four weeks of absence Marin County's
energetic Sheriff. W. P. Taylor, returned
home from his pursuit of J. E. King, who
is wanted for the murder of S. H. Church,
at the latter's ranch in the northern part
of this county about a month ago.
The scene of the crime was about forty
miles from here, and King had nearly
twenty-four hours' start of Taylor, who
pursued his man through six countied
and only lost the trail In the wild moun
tains of Trinity County.
Taylor's chase of King will rank with
any feat ever performed by a peace of
ficer of this State in pursuit of a criminal.
Taylor's trip took him through Sonoma.
Mendoclno, Teharaa, Shasta, Trinity and
,Slskiyou counties. He covered over 12Â»K)
miles, and mostly on horseback over some
j of the roughest trails and mountains in
the northern part of this State.
When seen this morning Mr. Taylor
said: '
"I am satisfied that King will be caught.
I lost his trail In the roughest portion of
Trinity County and went on north, where
I put men and olflccrs on the lookout.
King is accompanied by a half-breed In
dian, who is said to have piloted- him
through those mountains once before un
der similar circumstances. They cannot
travel at nieht in that rough country. If
they attempt it in the daytime they will
be captured. They are undoubtedly camp
ed In some of the hundreds of small
glades with which the mountains abound.
The officers all the way to Oregon have
been placed on the lookout, and it is a
miracle if King can escape that way."
Sheriff Taylor was waited on by a large
number of friends to-day, who congratu
lated him on the energy he has shown
in the chase.
COVE1X>, Aug. 20.â Murderer King is
still at large and hiding in the Trinity
mountains north of Covelo. So** says
George Whitney, a member of the Covelo
po.sse. who arrived here yesterday for
supplies for the scouting posse stationed
on Anthony Peak. Whitney believes King
Is alone and in hiding in some rugged
canyon or on some precipitous mountain
peak where he can command a view of all
the approaches to his lair. It is expected
that Sheriff Bergln will have joined the
Anthony Peak posse by the time Whitney
returns. Whitney left' this afternoon for
the mountains with a packhorse with
needed supplies for the posses.

It was while pursuing his studies that he
came to know intimately the Booth fam
ily and to the day of his death Snowden
cherished the memory of Edwin Booth,
the great actor he had known In his
youth.
When the gold fever era of "43 stirred
the country Snowden's mercurial disposi
tion drove him westward. He shipped for
California, and the home ties severed were
never reknlt. He became alien to his fam
ily and friends. The vicissitudes that came
to so many fortune hungers came also to
Snowden. But he was versatile and adapt
ed himself to new conditions. He tirst
essayed the exposition of the drama, and
In the hurly-burly days of the Argonauts
he strutted . "his. 1 brief hour upon the
stage,"? >TJien he turned to pursuits that
gave promise of more profit. He became
a Jewelry auctioneer, and many a miner
in the halcyon days of gold knew ths
brisk, young, handsome fellow who cried
his wares in the mining towns.'
Twenty-five years ago, in the prime of
lusty manhood. Snowden came to this sec
tion of the State. He followed one voca
tion after another, and finally he became
a hunter and fisherman, and this calling:
he followed till death claimed him.
Snowden's wants were few and his life
simple in his declining years. His house
was humble, yet he ever h*d a pleasant
greeting and a cheery word for his ac
quaintances. Intimate friends he had not
many, and to a few of these only did the
old man ever tell the history of his check
ered career. Shakespeare and Byron were
the old man's favorite authors, and being
gifted with retentive memory he often
entertained . his friends with ilong quota
tions from the plays of one and poems of
the other.
The only known relatives of the old
fisherman are a brother, A. Louden Sncw
den of Philadelphia, formerly Postmaster
of that city, then Director of the Mint lo
cated there, and during President Harri
son's administration Minister to Greece,
and a sister. Miss Maud L. Snowden of

The brief summary' tells the ups and.
downs, the happy and the sad days that
came into the life of the sturdy old man
with the fine old face, from which not the
battering: of the years, nor wind nor
weather, that had wrought furrows and
wrinkles and browned the skin, could
erase the stamp of intellectuality. Fato
made him her plaything, and the youth
who had^ been educated to become a
statesman and diplomat, as did his more
fortunate brother, passed the last night
of his life in a little fishing smack, pur
suing his humble calling.
Xo one saw the doom of Snowden. He
was alone when the wave? overturned his
boat and engulfed him. Were it not for
the sunny nature and cheerful philosophy
of the genial old llsherman one might be
led to think that he saw nothing in the
future to live for and sought oblivion In
the sea he loved so well. All that is
known, however, Is that the body of the
sturdy old man was found floating in
Monterey Bay, off the mouth of the
Salinas, on Saturday morning last. His
remains will be laid to rest in "Watson
ville's city of the dead to-morrow, and his
mourning friends, of whom there are
many, will pay their last tribute of affec

At a meeting of the Pacific Inter-Club
Yacht Association, held yesterday at the
Merchants' Exchange, the following were
present: President G. E. Billing^ in the
chair, ex-Commodore T. F. Tracy, Colonel

A deputation of three members of the
regatta committee of the semi-centennial
celebration of the Native Sons of the
Golden West was introduced and request
ed that the annual regatta of the associa
tion be made an important feature of the
celebration, and that as many yachts a*
possible take part in a parade along the
water front on September 9. The deputa
tion also announced that an appropriation
of $350 had been made for prizes, to be
awarded in such a manner as the associa
tion may*leem fit.
It was decided that the annual regatta
of the Inter-Club be held on
September 11, and that a parade of yachtH
on Sunday, September 9, be substituted
for the annual cruise. "The following are
the members of the regatta committee
having the regatta and parade in charge:
R. R, l'Hommedieu of the California
Yacht Club, chairman; C, L. Tisdale of
the Encinal Yacht Club, H. Gibbs of the
San Francisco Yacht Club, T. F. Tracy of
the Corinthian Yacht Club and F. E.
Coykendall of the South Bay Yacht Club.
The committee on the selection and pur
chase of trophies consists of A. M. Clay,
R. F. Peckham, C. F. Michaels, Orlo East
wood and J. R. Savory. T. F. Tracy was
appointed a committee' on tugboats and
R. It. 'l'Hommedleu a committee on
Etakeboats.
Two flags In addition to the trophies are
to be awarded to the yachts taking first
and second places In each class. R. R.
rHommedieu and Dr. C. L. Tisdale will
act as Judges, and H. Glbbs and F. E.
Coykendall as timers at 'the annual re
gatta. O. Eastwood, the secretary of the
association, will prepare the circulars and
H. Gibbs will look after the racing num
bers to be carried by the yachts.
Ex-Commodore A. M. Clay stated that
he had ommunicated with J. M. Macdon
ough with regard to the fifth of the scries
of Macdonough cups to be awarded, to the
winner In the thirty-foot class, and had
received a reply by cable authorizing the
association to order the trophy. The com
mittee on trophies will meet to-day to
select a design for the cup. It is under
stood that J. M. Macdonough will present
a second series of prizes, to be awarded
each year fov another period of five years.
It is probable, however, that the $250
awarded annually will be split up Into two
or even three prizes, instead of being ex
pended as heretofore upon a single tro
phy. In this way a large number of en
tries can be secured In two or three
classes, as the clubs are stronger in the
36-foot class than in 30-footers. The start
will be by the fire of a single gun. It Is
likely that several of the South Bay fleet
will be seen in the coming regatta, as the
South Bay Yacht Club has become a
member of the association.

|?F "SAPHO" had not been so exten
sively advertised by the police, it would
jj, probably have died an early and natu
ral death. In the four-act version pre
sented by the Frawley company at the
Grand Opera-house last night there was
one act of healthy, human feeling and
three acts of unwholesome, grutter sentl
mentalism. To have to sit through the
three acts for the sake of the one. Is a
penalty heavy enough to crush out a ten
dency to vice in even the most promising
criminal.
Miss Wakeman struggled through the
part of the mendacious heroine (?) with
an energy worthy of a better fate. Her
voice was better attempered to her task
than usual. and hence was more pleasing.
Her register is pitched so low, however,
that when she employs less force than the
ordinary her tones are lost in the huge
recesses of the Grand Opera-house stage;
much of the first act was quite inaudible.
Mr. .Reynolds played Jean Gausson in ex
cellent taste, never ranting and never be
coming feeble. Miss Van Buren made a
charming Irene and carried the audience
with her in the only wholesome act of the
playâ the third. Nobody else had any
thing particular to do, and all did it well.
One feels really sorry for intelligent
men and women obliged to earn a living
by playing In such stuff as this. "Sapho" as
a book shows how an unsavory subject
may be partly redeemed by pubtlety in
character study and by great skill In liter
ary presentation. "Sapho" as a play
takes only the bare outlines of a horrible
story and exhibits them under the fierce
glare of the footlights in all their naked
crude.ness. True, "Sapho" Is indeed a raw
and bleeding "slice of life," to use the
favorite nhrase of the Decadents, but all
slices of life are not fit for public carving..
Pig pens, equally with rose gardens, are
parts of life; but no healthy man prefers
Mr. Lee announced that Chief of Pollct
Sullivan had objected to his placing his

window and he was therefore obliged to
Sylvain A. Lee and his company of hyp
notists gave their second performance in
this city at the California last evening to
a full house. The Cakewalk and the yacht
excursion were the humorous features of
the entertainment.
California,
The "Wagnerites were'out In full force
last evening at the Tivoli Opera-house to
hear the first production of the favorite
"Tannhauser" that has been given at the
popular little theater, and much praise Is
due the enterprising management for the
manner In which this dlrflcult opera Is put
on. The orchestra has been enlarged to
forty pieces, which, considering the size
of the house, fully approximates to the
orchestra used during the grand opera
season by Grau at the Metropolitan Opera
house, in New York. It is also admirably
evident that rehearsals have not been
spared. From, the standpoint of smooth
ness, attack, good ensemble work gener
ally. It is rarely Indeed that a first-night
performance of so difficult an opera as
"Tannhauser" equals that given last night
at the Tivoli. In other directions the
opera was a surprise.
Miss Efflo Stewart, who made her first
appearance this season in the role of
Elisabeth, shows a considerable advance
on her good work of three years ago. Her
voice is magnificent. Absolutely true in
intonation, without the shadow of a vi
brato, sweet and powerful and of splendid
range, her Warner interpretation Is whol
ly admirable, that Is as far as the vocal
effort goes; Miss Stewart's acting is bet
ter left undone. Anna Lichter's Venu3
was the best bit of work she has done
this 'season. ' She looked, acted and sung
in thoroughly Eatlsfactory fashion.
Avedano is not happy in the part of
Tannhauser. His temperament like that
of Salassa, Is too essentially Latin to be
at ease in the phlegmatic, leisurely pro
gress of the Wagnerlan music drama, and
though the voices are there the unntness

Florence Roberts in the title role was as

she was admirably supported by White

No review of "The Only Way" would be
complete without a more than passing
notice of the wonderfully realistic mob
that helped to create the stirring picture
of the tribunal scene.
Another old favorite tnat got round af
ter round of applause even before he had
a chance to utter his first line was dear
old Stoddard. Stoddard came all the way
from New York to take up his original
part of M. Lorry, in Ernest Deiargs
Morgan finds a congenial role, one that
tits his clenched teeth and sullen look*.
Worthing was happily cast both in pro
logue and play, first as the roue Marquis
and after as the noble, sacrificing son,
suffering for his father's sins. Daniel
Harkins was a convincing Dr. Manette.
The best of "The Only Way" falls to
the men. The women of the cast have
comparatively little to do. Miss Margaret
Robinson looked after the joys and sor
rows of Lucie Manette In a not altogether
unpleasing way. Miss Elliston made
rather a vigorous Mimi.
"The Only Way" Is a lesson in history
and to this end the actor-manager ha.-.
called successfully to his aid the craft
of the property man, the stage carpenter
and an intelligent chorus. As Sidney
Carton Mr. Miller is at his best. Makeup,
gesture, tone, all go to paint' an enduring
stage picture. Tfte gorgeous glittering
audience last evening did not fail to rec
ognize this fact and palm music and boot
thunder testified their appreciation.
Painted In broad splashes of blood and

the play may stand beside the story. It
is not necessary to have read the latter to
appreciate the former. Those who know
and love "The Tale" will find naught in
the play to condemn. Lake unto the privi
lege accorded the poet is there also a
privilege accorded to the dramatist. Wills
has not been slow to take advantage of
the dramatist's license, and with a deli
cate hand, that has neither marred nor
desecrated, he has omitted some charac
ters, given Madame Defarge strength and
hatred to Monsieur Defarge, and idealized
a nameless little milliner, making her
stand forth in iaithful. tender little Mirai.

race, the Blue Hill, In its fifth renewal
and eleven horses faced the starter. All
eyes, however, were on Annie Burns, who
fulfilled expectations Immediately by
winning the first two heats, although
pressed hard in the first by Middlemay.
Just after the start in the third heat the
mare went into the air and danced there
until the field was an eighth of a mile
away, and it became a race between the
favorite and distance flag. In the mean
time Dlllonlte, who had gone through the
field and taken the lead, captured the
heat. The horses were held back a bit
in the last half, so Annie Burns gt>t In

told so severely on her that Dlllonlte won
the third heat jogging under the wire.

went right at his wheel and simply beat

Miss Mary Morss. daughter of George A.
Mors3. who met death in boiling water at
the State Hospital at Agnews, has re
fused, as her late father's guardian, to
pay the claim of $30 for six months' care
at the institution. Miss Morss' contention
Is that her parent's death was due to care
lessness on the part of attendants, and
that a proper investigation of the circum
stances was not had by the hospital
authorities.
By refusing to pay the claim Miss Morss
invites an action against her by the State.
She declares that she is prepared to make
a tight that will give the public a good
idea of what she claims is mismanage
ment | and carelessness in handling pa
tients at the asylum.
Miss Morss is a clerk In the office of the
Superintendent of Streets of Alameda.
Soon after her father was sent to Agnews
she was appointed guardian of his estate.
As he had some property Miss Morss ar
ranged that he should be cared for as a
"pay patient" at the regular State charge
of $15 a month. This was paid regularly
each six months. The last installment fell
due about the time of Morss' terrible
death. Superintendent Crane sent the bill
to Miss Morss. It is this account which
is refused payment upon the ground al
ready mentioned.
While not desirous of standing in a false
light, the young woman Insists that she
has good and justifiable ground for her
stand. Specially anxious is she to show.
If posssible. that the inquiry into the
cause of her father's demise was far from
satisfactory, and that the exculpation
from blame of those who were in charge
was not warranted by the evidence which
was Introduced at the Coroner's inquest.
Miss Morss will make an effort to hasten
any litigation which may be in view be
cause of her refusal to settle. In order that
she may have a full opportunity to pre
sent such facts as she has before her de
parture in a short time for Honolulu
Insists Institution Authorities Failed
to Make a Proper Inquiry Into
' Circumstances of the
Tragedy.

Remarkable Experience of a
Commercial Traveler
at Sonora.
sympathetic Hand of the
Law Seized Him.
Patrick B. Gallagher Violated License
Ordinance and Heavy and Un-
Patrick B. Gallagher is a jolly commer
cial traveler who has recently had the
novel experience of f^apting at midnight
in a dungeon cell in Sonora, Tuolumnc
County. Moreover, he was attended In
Eiirh nocturnal festivity by boon compan
ions, who supplied and helped to drain
the "flowing bowl" â¢while mirth was un
restrained. Of such mettle is the commei
c:al traveler that difficulties please him
and obstacles but amuse. Gallagher ran
up against the real thing in Sonejra. The
law. as personified by a Tuolumne con
Ftable, pursued him with relentlfss vigor
in a. wheeled vrhiclo, and after climbing
over mountain ridges and balancing nicely
on the pdget* of cliffs in the progress of the
journey, fixed him at Angels with an hyp
notic stony etaxe. froze the marrow in his
bones and carried him, crushed, triumph

All this happened because Gallagher
took orders for goods In Sonora without
raying the fee of $5, recently Imposed by

The trial of Charles G. Adams for the
murder of Edgar S. Kepner was continued
before Judge Lawlor yesterday. The dy
ing declaration of the dead man was ad
mitted in evidence after the proper foun
dation had been laid, and was handed to
the jury ' for inspection. Mrs. Kepner,
widow of the murdered man. testified that
as soon as she saw her husband after he
haa been shot he told her that he was go-
Ing to die. He kept asserting this fact up
to the time of his death, and it was with
the knowledge of approaching dissolution
that he made his declaration. It contains
statements of fact about the same as the
prosecution establishe-d, to wit. that Ad
ams had been discharged, went away, re
turned again for an explanation, cursed
his employer and then, after being or
dered from the barber shop at 44 O'Farrell
street, shot him.
Detective Harry Rpynolds and Police
man Patrick Sullivan both testified that
at one time the accused. Adams, told them
that he shbt Kepner while the latter was
advancing toward him, and later paid he
shot Kepner during a scuffle in self-de
fense. They also testified that Adams de
nied "that there was a woman in the
case."
At this point the prosecution rested and
the defense put Daniel Brooks on the
stand. Brooks testified that he heard a
noise In the shop, and on running In saw
Ke-pner holding on to Adams' collar, or
with his arm around his neck, he was not
positive which. Adams had a revolver in
his right hand. Brooks tried to take the
revolver away from Adams, and when he
found he was unable to do so he turned
and ran, slipped at the door and fell. As
he fell he heard the shot. Brooks had
some difficulty with his story, and counsel
frequently read from the record of the
witness" testimony taken in the Police
Court In order to refresh his memory. The
trial goes on again to-day.

Kelly and Crimmins recognize that they
are on the losing Bide, but they are fight
ing with desperation to get a few dele
gates to sell to the highest bidder. The
young men of the Republican party arc
now pretty well advised of the fact that
the Mint saloon bosses have no patronage
to bestow and very little to expect. The
game of getting delegations of enthu
siastic young Republicans and then giv
ing the delegates a programme with a
whisper that "Herrin wants this." has
been played once too often. Delegates
have been sold so many times at prices
fixed by Kelly and Crimmins that the
workers are willing to take their chances
with the Republicans who have no pro
gramme to whisper and no delegations to
Bell. When a delegation is sold Kelly and
Crimmins take the swag and the sold get
soup.
Kelly and Crimmins were trying yester
day to corral and brand several wavering
and irresolute county committeemen. Kel
ly was discouraged last night. Since he
was thrown out of the Democratic party
by Buckley for doing crooked work at the
San Jose convention which nominated
Stoneman for Governor he has not had a
harder experience than that which he
gained yesterday. The Republican . State
Central Committee has refused to sanction
his scheme for the nomination of Senators
and Assemblymen by the Fourth Con
gressional District Convention, hence the
business of selling positions on the Re
publican ticket is on the decline. As a
last resort he may endeavor to "hold up"

The Thirty-eighth District, represented
on the County Committee by J. C. Zeller
bach, M. A. Riordan, George L. Sharp. J.
O. Bourbln. L. B. Dalzlel, A. B. Truman
and Max Goldberg, met last night to put
up a delegate ticket. The majority refused
to recognize the minority member, A. B.
Truman. Goldberg said that Truman had
not conferred with him. Goldberg Is mak
ing Eddie "Wolfe's fight for the State Sen

Thirty-eighth and Thirty-seventh districts
a set of men who will cast aside all con
siderations of decency and nominate
Wolfe for another term.
In the Twenty-ninth District last night
John J. Daughney and John B. McNa
mara of the County Commiteemen were
informed when they went to attend a
called meeting that the work of putting
up a ticket and selecting election officers
had been done. E. H. LÂ«utgens, when ask
ed how it was done, passed out a resolu
tion. He did not know where he got the
resolution, and not being able to read It
was not in position to enlighten his fel
low members of the committee.
BOSSES TURNED DOWN.
Thirty-Fourth District Delegates to
Convention Are Pledged Against
Crimmins and Kelly, v - ,
The Regular Republican Club of the
Thirty-fourth District, the anti-Crlmmins
and Kelly organization, met last evening
and elected delegates to the State and
municipal conventions,' all of whom were
pledged to act against boss rule, . bosses
and ballot-box stuffing. A resolution in
troduced by George W.: Elder was adopted.
This commended the County Committee
men for the action they have taken on the
side of political decency and approved of
the action of Chairman Bouvler in ap
pointing such a representative committee
as a returning board, which gave assur
ance that a fair and honest primary would
be held.
It was voted to send out a circular let
ter to every voter in the district, setting
forth the reasons for opposition to bosses
and boss rule. After the adjournment of
the club meeting the delegates met and
formulated the text of the letter to be
sent broadcast. The delegates elected
were as follows:
To the State conventionâ J. K. C. Hobbs.
I. J. Truman, Adam Beck, TV. W. Chase, H.
G. Krasky, J. G. Levensaler, F. W. Burnett,

This attack left her so worn that she is
still in bed. unable to assist herself."
Assistant District Attorney Deuprey,
who successfully opposed a motion for an
indefinite continuance made by Mrs. Cra
ven's counsel, addressed Dr. Clinton, and
asked how long it would be in the opinion
of the witness before Mrs. Craven could
appear in court.
"I cannot say. and do not believe she
will ever be strong enough to appear in
court that her trial may proceed." an
swered the physician. "She is go weak
that any great excitement or sudden
shock would kill her. I would suggest.
however, that the charge against her be
postponed until at least September 1. By
that time I will be in a position to make
a more positive statement regarding her
condition, though my belief is that he*- ill
ness will prevent her trial. Her health is
too badly shattered to withstand any con
tinued excitenifnt. In my opinion she
should be permitted to go into the country
for several weeks. Such a trip might
benefit her health, and it might not. Af
fections of the he-art generally result in
suddrn if not unexpected end; In such
cases a correct prognosis is seldom made."
Dr. Clinton's statements were corrobo
rated by his associate. His suggestion
that a continuance be granted until Sep
tember 1 was accepted by the court, and
a formal order for continuance was grant
ed. Owing to the continuance in Mrs.
Craven's case it was decided to also con
tinue the arraignment of Sylva aÂ»d Simp
ton, that the cases might be taken up con
currently.
"Mrs. Craven." he said, "is in a danger- ;
ous condition. She is suffering from re- I
current heart failure, and is so seriously j
afSie-re-d that she is unable to leave her '
apartments for days at a time. Last Sat- j
urday she was itrtdksn wiih an attack <
and remained unconscious for some hours. I
Mrs. Craven. G. W. Simpton and Adolph
Fylva were to have been arraigned yes
terday morning. As soon as the matter
Â¦was called the precarious condition of the
woman defendant was called to the at
tention of the court. Dr. Clinton was first
called to the stand. He testified that un
dor Fkillfu! treatment Mrs. Craven might
rally sufficiently within the next few
%vreks to appear in court for a few hours,
but never in hi? opinion would she be able
to sit ihrouph a protracted trial.
MRS. NETTIE R. CRAVEN, who

tract wife of the late James G.
Fair, may be claimed by death at any mo
racnt Drs. C. A. Clir.ton and H. K. Hap
persberger took the stand in Judge Cook's
court yesterday morninar and stated under
oath that in their opinion Mrs. Craven
would never be tried on the charge of
porjury against her, "for." they paid, "her

PERHAPS UNTO DEATH.
BERKELEY, Aug. 20.â The body of A.
B. Remick was found this morning in a
room in the Walworth Hotel. The man
had been dead several hours. Death Â¦jva.i
evidently due to chloroform.
At 10 o'clock last night Remick and E. H.
Simonds went to the Walworth and got
a room for the first named. Simonds went
to his home at 2434 College avenue, this
city, promising to call for Remick at 5:3.)
o'clock in the morning. Unable to rouse
Remick, an entrance was made through
the transom and a physician was sum
moned.
In the room was found a 500-gramme
bottle of chloroform from a Brooklyn. N.
Y.; wholesale firm, about. one-fourth oi"
which had been used. No papers of any
sort were found. The man's clothes were
jjood and he had a small sum of money.
Simonds had known Remick. he says,
for two months only, having met him in a
business way. Remick was a native of
Scotland, about 30 years of age and a
chemist by occupation. Up to two months
ago he lived at Crescent Mills, Placer
County.
Simonds could give no reasons why
Remick should commit suicide. He was
in good spirits th^ niijht before.
Remick came down to San Francisco
some weeks ago and put up, as was his
custom, at the Russ House. It is saltl
that he -was arranging for the extensive
development of some mining interests
which he had near Quincy, Plumas Coun
ty, and had made large purchases of ma
chinery to be shipped there during tho
next few days. lie had a good deal of
assaying work done lately by E. H. Sl
monds and John Taylor & Son, and made
a number of assays himself, giving good
evidence of possessing an excellent scien
tific education. He was a member of sev
eral scientific societies in England and
Scotland and was the possessor of several
medals therefrom.
Remick seemed to be well supplied with
money up to a few days ago, and paid
his hotel and other bills very promptly.
Friday and Saturday, however, he gavo
out a. number of checks on one of tho
local banks with London connections,
payment of which was refused, it is sala
this morning, on the ground that he had
no money to his credit, and did no busl
noss lhf?i*6"
One check was for $300, another for $250
and still another for S3X>. Joe Poheim got
another of SÂ«0 in payment for a suit of
clothes he had made for Remick. The
checks were drawn in a regular check
book of the bank above mentioned and
were all presumably in payment of bills.
On Saturday evening Remick was appa
rently without money, as when about to
start out to the theater he applied to the
clerk at the desk to cash a check for $100.
H* could readily have had the amount
and more, but it was not on hand, and he
onlv got $20. He went over to Berkeley
to see Mr. Slmonds on Sunday evening,
with the understanding that he would be
on hand early Monday morning to close
some contracts which he had made for
work at his mines. It is said that he
spoke of expecting a draft for a consider
able sum of money and signified his in
tention of having the amount telegraphed
from New York on Monday if the drart
did not come to hand by that time.

WHEN death came to the late
Adolph Sutro tho hasty actions
of his many creditors nearly re

tate. That it stands to-day with perhaps
a million dollars free for distribution to
his heirs, Reuben H. Lloyd stated yester
day in Judge Coffey's court, was due
solely to the quick action of counsel , rep
resenting the executrix and executor cf
his last will and also to their close as-

sociations with the various bahks holding
large mortgages and other claims against
his property. Lloyd & Wood and J. C.
McKinstry have represented Sirs. Emma
L. Merritt and W. II. R. Adamson. ex
ecutrix and executor of the dead million-
aire's will, since his death, and to them
selves they hold credit Is due for the pres
ervation of the estate.
The matter of the settlement of the an
nual account of the executor and execu
trix of the will was cailed for hearing by
Coffey. The various receipts an<l
expenditures were taken up by the court
and passed upon until it came to the claim
of the attorneys for the executrix ami
executor. Lloyil & Wood and J. C. Mv-
Kinstry asked for $10,001 for their services.
Though no opposition was made to this
amount heing allowed the attorneys. th-Â»
heirs, Edgar E. Sutro especially. ask*-<l
that the attorneys await payment until
the estate is in better condition. Mr.
Lloyd pointed out that on one occasion h.Â»
had waived payment of his fee in order
that the taxes on decedent's property
might be paid and he said that this fact
would doubtless be accepted as evidence
that he had no desire at any time to
embarrass the estate. He then said that
he believed the amount asked for was not
excessive in view of the labor performed
by himself and his associates to preserve
the estate and prevent It being- forced Into
involuntary insolvency by its creditors.
Judge Coffey then allowed the claim.
A mortgage for $465,000 still stands over
the property.. Counsel stated yesterday
that they would endeavor to reach an
agreement by which probate expenses
could be stopped by distributing the prop
erty subject, however, to this big mort
gage. Effort will then be made to sell
sufficient of the undivided interests to pay
off the mortgage and leave an unincum
bered balance.

While there is so much to be^gained by the recall

In this emergency the Ministers have an opportu
nity to make an effective political stroke! By relieving
Roberts frem command in % South Africa they can
bring him home and give him the position of com
mander in chief of the army. By so doing they get
rid of Lord Wolseley and shift responsibility for the
mistakes of the War Department. They can go to the
country with a promise of army reorganization under
the direction. of the popular hero of the hour. They
will get the credit of rewarding Roberts, and of in
tending to reform the army. They will also be able
to claim that a complete. victory has been gained in
South Africa and point to Roberts' return as an evi
dence that war is virtually over.
In a general election at this time it is certain a
majority of Britsh voters will be affected more or less
by the war in South Africa. On that score the Min
istry is fairly safe, but it has one point of weakness.
The course of the war from start to finish has proven
that the army administration has been bad for years
past. The troops were sent to the field ill supplied
and ill armed. The Boers, who were despised as a
half-educated lot of ill-trained farmers, showed them
selves better armed, better supplied with artillery and
better commanded than the British, so that it was
only by excess of numbers that even Roberts was
able to prevail over them. Something will have to be
done by the Ministers to assure the people of a better
administration of the War Department hereafter, or
else a good many Britons will vote against the Min
isterial candidates and perhaps overthrow the Ministry
itself.
REPORTS from London are to the effect that the
Government is arranging to relieve Lord Rob
erts of command in South Africa and to depute
to a general of lower rank and fewer years the'ha
rassing work of running down the scattered bands
that are continuing the war for the independence of
the Transvaal. It is very likely that these reports are
true, for not only would such relief be a kindness to
Roberts, but it would be good politics for the Min
istry in the elections which, it now appears assured,
are to take place this fall.
ROBERTS TO BE RELIEVED.
Whether this improvement in the position of the
grower be a result of the organization of the Cured
Fruit- Association or â¢ a coincidence merely, is a
question that cannot be completely answered at this
time. The fact itself, however, is the main point of
satisfaction, whatever be the cause. The prunc
growerhas now a better position in relation to the
market than he has had for years and it is hardly
probably he can fail to profit by, it. .-. -...'â¢-. '
One feature of the San Jose dispatch is significant
of a wholesome change in the prune business' and is
worth noting. In the estimates of the crop and of
probable prices, the dispatch quote not only the pack
ers, but the growers. It is evident' therefore that the
judgment of the grower has cg,nte to be an important
factor in the market. He no longer has to ask of
others what the price of his product is to be. â¢ He has
begun to have a voice in calculating the price and
to exert some power in fixing it.
According to the best advices we have been able to
obtain, the packers' estimates are exaggerated, , and
even those of the growers are beyond the mark. They
do not take into account the. excessive shrinkage in
drying, which has been thus far noted in the crop. For
some cause the prunes in almost every district have
not only dropped earlier than usual, but have lost in
weight when dried much more than the average of
past years. Thus a crop that shows large on the
trees suffers a considerable shortage when it is dried
and ready for the market. This appears from reports
to be true also of the crop in France and the output
there will not be nearly so large as has been expected.
A LATE dispatch from San Jose says: "The
prune situation is an all-absorbing topic among
the growers of this valley. Leading packers
estimate the crop of the State at 150,000,000 pounds
for this year, some going as high as 175,000,000.
Growers are more conservative in estimates and place
the State's yield at from 125,000,000 to 135,000,000
pounds. It is claimed that the output of Europe and
America this year will be .100,000,000, pounds more
than last year." .

CALIFOBNIANS IN WASHINGTON
IT is necessary that ihe too current missionary view
oi the Chinese question shall be opposed strongiy,
and in time to prevent the impression it is intended
lo make upon public opinion. With some honorable ex
ceptions, the missionaries have been crying for war
and slaughter, acting more like the devotees of Mars
than ihe followers of Jesus.
It these missionaries fed a call to go abroad and
do proseiyiing work, the sole honor and credit to
them will follow their going on their own responsi
bility at their own risk. Government is secular
and has no right of partnership with any form of the
rclipious idea. Not long ago the American mission
aries in Japan were impudently protesting against the
Jajianese law fc>rbiduing the teaching of religion iu
the public schools. They even demanded that our
Government interfere, to compel Japan to open the
schools to the teaching of the various sectarian brands
of Christianity! A more impudent. ofTen5ive and
peace-dispelling agitation cannot be conceived
Nearly everything said by our missionaries, who have
pat the crown of martyrdom away and scuttled out of
China, proves them to be dangerous to the world'*
peace. We are aware that when this is said they admit
it. and breathing slaughter, quote Christ, "I come no:
lo bring peace, but the sword."
Wrenching an Oriental metaphor from its pureiv
spiritual meaning, they make it the excuse for advis
ing the raiding of millions of Chinese homes by the
slaughterers hired by the Czar and Kaiser.
As a rule, all of these missionaries want Chinese ter
ritory stolen by the Western nations. Regardless
of ail right and justice, they show their utter unfitness
to be trusted among a strange people, for they do not
scruple to treat the Chinese as having no right to their
own homes or their own country.
One of them, Mr. Medhurst, without being rebuked
by the congregation, said in a pulpit in this city on
Sunday night, "The Chinese converts are looked
upon by their heathen fellow-countrymen as foreign
ers, and I do not think that after this war there will
be many Christian natives left. China is entering on
a new era. America should still hold her troops over
there. s O that at the end of the war she can have her
appropriation of territory."
Now, we desire to sx.y to this gentleman and his
collergues. who seem to have been salaried and sup
ported in China by alms of the home churches, only to
lure natives into antagonism to their country and then
leave them to be butchered, that America wants no
"sppropriation of territory" in China, and will pre
vent the other Christian nations from stealing any, if
she can.
We have revcr read a more immoral, dishonest and
dishonorable, a more wicked, outrageous and cor
rupt proposition than this. America has no more
right to ".-.ppropriate territory" in China than the
church sexton had to appropriate the shirt off this
immoral missionary's back, and the honest people of
this country will not permit such pretended followers
of Christ to make the republic a thief.

Those words so true then are equally true now.
The Republican party is on trial before the people of
San Francisco. If the better elements abandon it
in the contest and permit the Mint Saloon boss and
his friends in the Southern Pacific law office and the
dives of the tenderloin to carry the primaries, it will
fare badly when election day comes. Therefore let
all who love the party act now and act with the vim
and vigor necessary for victory.
Long ago General S. W. Backus, writing to Dibble
as a friend and warning him in vain against the course
he was pursuing in the Legislature, said: "No.v,
Judge, you cannot afford to stand rn with these
pirates. Association with Crimmins and Kelly means
political death to you and the forfeiture of the good
opinions of your thousands of friends throughout this
district. It means more: The Republican party is on
its last legs in this State if men like you fail to live up
to its high promises and permit its councils to be de
bauched by jobbers and corruptionists who have en
tered into secret league with Sam Rainey and the
devil."
Every issue and circumstan-t of the time prompts
Republicans to revolt against the efforts of the South
ern Pacific and its allies to control the party in this
city. It is known that any symptom of such control
will endanger the whole ticket. At this Juncture,
when it is so important to have an honest Legislatu-e,
creatures of the typi of Dibble and Wolfe cannot
be elected by Republican votes at least even if nomi
nated. That much has been shown clearly by the
temper of the people and particularly by that of the
better element of the Republican party. Corruption
cannot win on election day and therefore those Re
publicans who desire to make a sweeping victory then
should act now so as to keep the tools of corruption
out of the party convention.
There are ample reasons for believing that good
tickets, earnestly supported by good men, can win in
every district in the city. All depends upon Repub
licans themselves. The bosses are, of course, at work
and will bring all their toughs and rounders to the
polls. The better elements of the party must be
equally vigorous in bringing out the vote of all who
r.rc opposed to boss domination.
) Such being the case, 'it is the duty of honest Re
publicans to nominate honest and thoroughly repre
sentative men in every district. Not a single one'
should be left uncontested. The bosses should have
no walkover anywhere. The fight should be made for
true Republicanism all along the line and every stanch
and loyal member of the party should share in it.
It is to be borne in mind, however, that what has
been attained is only an opportunity for a fair elec
tion and an honest count. It remains with the better
element of the party in the various districts to de
termine whether the opportunity shall be taken ad
vantage of, or whether the bosses shall be left free to
carry out their programmes. , The County Com
mittee cannot do everything. The committee of
eighteen can do no more than assure fair play to all.
Unless honest Republicans come to the front and take
an active part in the elections the victory after all
will be with the bosses.
â¢ . â^â â â â
UNDER the supervision of the committee of
eighteen, appointed by Chairman Bouvier of the
County Committee, the Republican primaries in
this city afford an opportunity for honest men to elect
genuine Republicans to the county convention and
thus assure the nomination of a ticket which will
command the support not only of all true Repub
licans, but of independent voters as well. For accom
plishing that no small amount of credit is due to the
members of the County Committee, who stood firmly
for honest politics and fair dealing in spite of all that
Herrin, Crimmins and Kelly and their combined
gangs could do to coax or bulldoze them into dis
honest paths.

FOL1TICAL HYPOCRISY.
%
THIS is August, 1900. It is only two years since
the war with Spain, which Mr. Bryan^ urged, be
cause he said it would be good politics, was
ended by request of that beaten power. Spain was
not a novice in war and knew when to cry enough
snd quit an unequal struggle in which she got little
shame and we little glory on account of the in
equality of the combatants.
Colonel Bryan seems to have deeply pondered how
to get some grood politics out of it. It is known that
the leaders of his part}- in Congress informed the
President that they intended to make an issue against
him, whichever course he took in dealing with the
miserable legacies of that '.var. Indeed, they did not
jcruple to admit to him that they would have had a
belter issue against him if he had not taken the Philip
pine?. Their high sincerity being certified by their
attitude toward the President, it is highly proper that
they should be led by Bryan, who is responsible for
the ratification of the treaty of Paris, and that their
principal newspaper support is by Hearst's -yellow
triplets.
Hearst is president of the National Association of
Bryan Clubs. We believe that it was on the 6th of
this month that he announced the accession of 4000
members to his organization, drawn to it by Bryan's
anti-expansion platform and speeches.
On August 6, 1898, just two years before, when the
Philippine issue was yet in the yolk, Hearst said in
his San Francisco Examiner, "What are we in the
Philippines for? From the standpoint of our duty
tc the world there is but one course open to us. We
must hold on to the Philippines."
When Professor Van Hoist of Chicago denied that
cur duty to the world required holding on to the
Philippines, Hearst said, on August 7: "Annexation
and expansion are with us for better or for worse, and
the whole chorus of croakers like Van Hoist will not
make it any better."
August 9 Hearst savagely attacked all opponents
of retaining the Philippines, calling them "little
Americans," and declaring that we would permanent
ly retain the Philippines and should hold the people
down with an armj r , the cost which "will be paid out
of the island revenues, on which it will be a proper
charge."
In that month of August, 1898, .Senator Morgan of
Alabama was in San Francisco. In his speech 5n
the Native Sons' Hall he had grossly insulted Mr.
Cleveland and as grossly lied about him, to the great
delight of Hearst. On the 10th Morgan made a
Speech in which he said: "The morning papers tell us
that fome brave Californians have died in battle in
Manila. Above the graves of these heroes the Amer
ican flag floats to-day, and I believe the American
people will never consent to haul it down. That flan
will remain. The hand of God Almighty planted it
there."
This discovery that the Almighty was in the busi
ness of nailing the flag to the Philippines delighted
Hearst so much that he not only printed it in his
news columns, but quoted it in his editorial.
Some of the labor organizations having deprecated
expansion, on August 12 Hearst said in the Exam
iner: "Under the circumstances we cannot see any
thing but good for the American laborer as the result
of acquisition of the Philippines."
August 17 Hearst sr.id: "With Manila in our hands
by right of conquest, it becomes more than ever im
po?s.ible to withdraw the American forces from the
Philippines. The American flag must be nailed to the
Philippine flagstaff," and on the 20th he said: "As
for the Philippines, the obligations we have assumed
there make it necessary that the American flag shall
be nailed to the staff from which,* by the valor of
Deweytind Merritt, it now flies."
On August 24 General Barnes made an extreme
expansion speech to the Republican State Conven
tion and Hearst indorsed it. complimenting the Gen
eral, that "he spoke for the broadest and most progres
sive of the thinking men of the country."
When Brynn was notified and made his acceptance
speech at Indianapolis, the most conspicuous thing in
sight was Hearst's advertisement of his newspapers.
He had streamers across all the main streets and plac
ards on the backs and bellies of sandwich men and
streamers on carriages; through the city all space that
could be spattered with a sign was taken up in glorify
ing and boasting of the "only three Democratic pa
pers in the United States."
He was appealing for dimes to the very people
whom he was denouncing two years before as "little
Americans. Tories, copperheads and traitors."
He and 'the hand of God" Morgan are jowl by jowl
in supporting Bryan upon the paramount issueâ
the surrender of the" Philippines. If ever brazen
hypocrisy relied on the short memory of the people
this is a case of that kind.
PRINCE REMEMBERED A PLAYMATE.
Ten years ago, when the Crown Prince of Japa"n was in his
thirteenth year, his Highness spent a summer at Futamiguara,
Isc. While out in the water one clay the Prince noticed a fish
erman's boy of about the same age as himself, whose skill in
swimming drew forth his admiration. The lowly youth, whose
name was Yei. was presented to the Prince, and there sprang
tip a friendship between the two. His Highness was once more
back at Ise the other day, on his wedding tour, and the Prince
thought of Yei. He wanted to see his old friend, and after a
good deal of trouble the order was conveyed to Yei, now grown
a sturdy young man, but still poor and lowly. In high delight
the Prince talked freely of the past, and then allowed Yet to
take leave of him loaded with various presents.

," VAVIU yÂ°u now place your hand in this boiling metal and
ladle out a. portion of it?' said Playfair.
" 'Do you tell me to do this?' asked the Prince.
I do, was the answer.
"The Prince instantly put his hand into" the caldron and
ladled out some of the boiling lead without sustaining any in

tween Great Britain and America when President Cleveland's
Venezuelan message brought the two countries into dangerous
antagonism.
Among Playfair's students at the University of Edinburgh
was the Prince of Wales, of whom a curious anecdote is told:
. "It was while the Prfince of Wales was living in Edinburgh,
as Playf air's pupil in the application of science to industry,
that an interesting incident occurred. The two were standing

"The Gorman Empress," writes a correspondent of tho
London Times, "leads a very regular life at Homburg.* Every
morning she rides out for two hours, and in the afternoon she
.never falls to take a drive, generally accompanied by her sis
ter, the Duchess of Glucksburg. /
"Her Majesty Is having a strict course of the treatment,
and bathes daily, as well as drinking a prescribed quantity of
water brought for her use from the Klizabethen Brunnen. ana
hopes, on leaving Homburg, to loin her yacht, the Induna, witn
her two youngest children, and enjoy a week or two cruising
in the Baltic before she goes to Schlosa Wllhelmshohe. near
Cassel, for the rest of the summer."
ALBERT EDWARD'S HUMOR.
Not so very long ago the Prince of "Wales was present at
the opening of a large charitable Institution, says a correspond
ent. In the course of the ceremony the president chanced to
raise his hat to salute the Prince, when to the crowd's amuse
ment his wig came off at the same time, leaving a perfectly
bald head. That the Prince had taken due note of the mishap
was evident several hours later at dinner. "When proposing
the president's health he lifted his glass. "To thÂ© worthy
president, who appears to grow younger Instead of older every

weary one, but success in it will depend mainly upon
the activity of the brigade commanders who are pur
suing the scattered bands. It has availed Roberts little
to throw out a far-reaching net to surround the Boer
commandos, when by swift marching they get away
from him. Moreover, it will be just as well to give
Kitchener a chance to show what he can do. Thus,
taking all things into consideration, it is probable that
Roberts' career in the field is about over. He will
return to London to be endowed with those honors,
titles and pensions that Great Britain is so lavish in
bestowing upon her military chiefs, and then he will
be set to work at the hardest task he has ever con
fronted â that of weeding aristocratic pretensions out
of the British military system and making the army
equal to the growing needs of the empire.

Revolting Story Told by an Eye-
Witness to the Killing of
the Jones Brothers at
Goodland.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DENVER, Aug. 20.â Ferocious instincts
had control of the people of Goodland,
Kansas, after the killing of the Union Pa
cltlc train robbers who robbed the express
near Hugo, August 4, one of whom was
burned to death. One of the detectives
who was in the posse returned to-day
from the scene of the capture and the
killing and says that the people in the
vicinity behaved like wild animals when
the body of the half burned robber was
taken out of the ruins of the Bartholomew
ranch house. Neither the Sheriff nor the
Coroner was able to restrain the crowd
which followed the body as it was borne
away.
The crowd forced Its way into the under
taker'8 shop. While the Coroner was out
of the oBlco several prominent persons of
the city got Into the room where the body
lay. One qarried a large butcher knife
and commenced a most terrible desecra
tion of the corpse. Pieces of llesh from
the dead robber's body were doled out as
souvenirs. If the Coroner had not ar
rived Just about that time it is probable
that there would have been no dead rob
ber to bury.
When the Coroner drove the crowd
away there was a rush for the smoking
ruins of the house, where several persons
found small pieces of the robber's bones.
The robbers were identified as the Jones
brothers of Springfield, Mo. The Union
Pacific will pay Bartholomew for the loss
of his burned hou.'-e.

NEW YORK. Aug. 20. â Frederick
Scharn, brother of Katherlne Scharn, the
young girl who was murdered in her
apartments Saturday night, and Lincoln
Elsenprice, said to be the girl's lover,
â¢were arraigned to-day and held for the
Coroner. The police no longer think rob
bery the cause of the crime.
Dr. Donlin. Coroner's physician, per
formed an autopsy on the body to-day.
He says Ihe young woman was not ham
mered" to death, but was strangled.
Inspector Hartrey. who has the Scharn
murder case in hand, gave out late to-day
the following: "The undertaker who lives
next door to the house where the murder
occurred says be was sitting in front of
his place, adjoining that where the mur
der occurred, from 7 o'clock Saturday'
evening until 10:30. During that time he
saw no one enter the house where the
murder was done or come out: neither did
he hear anv unusual noise, and the people
In the house heard no unusual noise dur
ing the night."
The inspector said that so far as he had
investigated he had found no evidence
derogatory to the character of the dead
girl. In his opinion the murder was done
by some one who was then in the girl's
apartment without her knowledge. He
believed this by the lack-of evidence of a
struggle. The only thing overturned In
the room was an easy chair, and he thinks
she was knocked over while sitting in the
chair and was dragged from It to her bed
room. He thinks the murder was com
mitted in the sitting-room, as he found n
clot of blood on the carpet, where ; the
body had probably lain for a little while
before it was dragged to the other room.

NETl- YORK. Aug. 20.â Senator Wil
liam Stewart of Nevada called at
Republican headquarters - to-day
and said he had decided to vote for
President JIcKinley. He made a
statement in part as follows:
"The United States went to war with
Bpain. ureed by the Democrats. The pop
ularity of the war was such that Mr.
Bryan joined the army. The war was suc
cessful and a treaty of peace was entered
Into whereby the United Stales agreed
to pay $20,000,000 and accept the sovereign
ty and public property of Spain in the
Philippine archipelago. There was oppo
sition to ratification of the treaty. Mr.
Bryan came to Washington and persuad
ed his Democratic friends to vote for the
treaty, and it was through his influence
tha-t the trea.ty was finaJly ratified. It
then bÂ«carr.e the duty of the United
States to maintain law and order and pro
tect the lives and property of al! resi
dents in the islands, whether native or
foreign born. The United States at the
time of the ratification of the treaty held
military possession of Manila; and imme
diately after such ratification assnuuo
the sovereignty of the islands. Tne peo
ple of the United States, particularly oÂ£
the Pacil-c Coast, became entitled to the
vast commerce of the Pacihc Ocean, of
which the Philippines furmsh the Key.
-Once Apuinalao had raised a rebellion
in Luzon against Spain before the com
mencement of the Spanish war with the
United States. This adventurer had sold
out or settled his rebellion with Spam for
S400O00 before Dewey se* s=ail for Man:. a.
and as a part of the bargain with Spain
Aguinaldo agreed to leave the islands anÂ«l
ct-ver return.
"Dewey took the wily agitator back to
the islands, supposing, as a matter of
course, that Aguinalao would naturally
be an enemy of Spain and a friend of the
United States. In this Admiral Dewc-y
Â¦was mistaken. Xgruinaldo, as soon as he
landed on his native soil, organized a re
bellion against the United States, v.hich
would have been of little consequence 4f
be had not been able lo obtain comfort
and aid in this country. An organization
was formed in the United States called
the AnU-Impor1alist League, which has
fcr the last two years co-operated with
Ajruinaldo's Taga.1 junta. wiLh headquar
ters at Hongkong, to supply literature and
materials of war for Agumaldo. President
McKinley had no authority to buy out
.AsruinaJdVs rebellion against the United
State?, but was bound by the treaty
(which was the supreme law of the land)
to maintain law and order and protect life
and property in the islands. It required a
large army and th*> expenditure of hun
dreds of millions of dollars to put down
Aguinaldo's rebellion. The assistance and
the encouragement he received from the
AnJ'-Impcrialist Lieagrue and the enemies
of the United States, both at home and
abroad, made his barbarous and irregular
war bloody s.vA expensive.
â¢*f or.prf'ss. however, made all necessary
appropriations, providing for the execu
tive men -ind money to maintain the au
thority of the United States '.n thr Philip
pines." The so-called anti-imperialists de
clared the policy pursued by the Gov
ernment to put down the rebellion and
maintain Jaw and order in all territories
of tho United States, without regard to
the time when such territories were ac
quired ma 'in:r>~rial!sm' and that any use
of the 'army to maintain law and order â
however nec<--Â«?arj"â was 'militarism.' and
that giving aid and comfort to rebels in
arms against the United States was
'mnintaininp iho principles of the Declara
tion of Independence.'
"Mr. Bryan's unparalleled campaign for
the rrtn < "'Pl es Â°f the Chicago platform,
ar.d his insistence upon the adoption of
that platform at Kansas City, induced
the people to suppose that the campaign
of 1900 would be conducted on the issues
cf l>-i*6. In this it seems they were mis
taken." ,, _
Senator Stewart then quotes Mr. Bry
an's declaration of his intention, if elect
ed, to call an extra session of Congress
to sive the Philippines freedom upon the
fame terms as Cuba. He also denounces
the recent convention of anti-imperialists
st Indianapolis. He also denounces Mr.
P.ryan for' promising to attempt to "ex
terid the Monroe doctrine to the Orient."

XEW YOPvK. Aug. 20.â A World f=p*clal
from Washington says: President McKin
ley has decided to accept the challenge of
Mr. Bryan's Indianapolis speech and will
devote nearly all of his letter of accept
ance to the question of imperialism. He
will endeavor to show how the Republi
can party, from his point of new, has
wrought a great and lifting benefit by its
course during and sir.ee the war with
Hpain. The authority for these state
ments is Governor Roosevelt.
It was learned to-day that the President
â¢will make sc-veral speeches during the
campaign, mr>re than he had led the Re
publican managers to expect. These Â¦will
r.ot be announced beforehand. They will
just happen. But they will happen at
opportune tlmc6 and be as strong as the
President can make them.
It was practically decided to-night that
the letters of acceptance should not be
given out until the President returns to

REPUBLICAN DELEGATES.
Mills Wallace, chairman of the Demo
cratic convention, denounced Manly in a
j violent speech at midnight. He declared
that Manly was not a Democrat, and ex
horted the delegates over whom he pre
sided not to vote for him. The convention
made the indorsement, nowever, and Wal
lace then proceeded to denounce the con
vention, declaring that the delegates were
not frre men, but that they had been
cowed by the threats of the Populists.
The convention closed amid the most
dramatic scenes, the iight between the
various factions resembling the stormy
times of several years ago.
Th<; Democrats chose the following dele
gates to the State Convention, subject to
the primaries:
Sixty-second Assembly Districtâ J. W.
I Briscoe, E. H. Tucker. John Cercni. J.
I Jackson. J. J. Vanderburg. E. W. Wilson,
John Daniels and Edwin Gowcr. Sixtv
j thirdâ A. J. Elmore. W. II. McKenzfe
{ John C Morror, N. P. Justy, J. A. Ward,
Marvin Simpson and J. T. Chick.
The Populists indorsed the Democratic:
nominees for Judges, r.nd passed a resolu
tion declaring their intention of "fusing"
on such other nominations as the Demo
crats should make. In return the Demo
crats indorsed \V. P. Manly, the Popu.Ust
Supervisorial candidate, and thus com
pleted the "fusion" bargain.
Interest in the Democratic Convention
culminated this evening when the time
came for nominating the candidates for
the two Superior Judgeships. Nearly ev
ery* democratic lawyer in Fresno had
entered the race and the contest was the
most exciting seen In a Fresno convention
in many a day. E. D. Edwards, the pres
ent Assistant District Attorney, received
one of the nominations on the first bal
lot. Oeorge E. Church received the next
highest number of votes and on the third
builot he was nominated as Edwards'
running mate.
During the balloting there was a good
deal of acrimonious discussion, and fre
quent references to the stabbing affray in
the morning.
FRESNO. Aug. 20.â The Democratic
and Populist County Conventions were
in sesbion here all day. The only nomi
nation made by the Populists was that

He put in the entire day at the farm, thus
preventing all interruptions. The speech
will be only about half the length of the

both to the Populist nomination and the
Monetary League indorsement in case he
receives notice of the latter. Mr. Bryan

"It is customary," said Mr. Morrison,
"to Invite the President, but never a can

ON A THIRD CHARGE
Point Lobos Improvement Club to the
Front for Measures Deemed
Necessary.
The Point Lrfib^s Improvement Club ha-*
prveral measures under consideration, all
looking to the improvement of the Rich
mond district. The first ar.d most Im
portant to be Irought to the attention of
the municipal officials is the taking off of
three feet from both sid^-s of the side
walk on Clement Ktreet. Since th*Â» Sutro
? iectric car line extended its rails on this
thoroughfare th" street has been declared
too narrow for traffic While the roadway
is thus congested the sidewalks are de
ctared to be too wide. To equalize this
lopsided condition the club proposes to
have three feet taken off the sidewalks of
dement street and add that much to the
width of the street. Before this can be
done, however, it will be neecssary to ob
tain the consent of a majority of the prop
erty owners and also to have the Super
visors take action.
The club also wlsbd to have thrce-fot

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS
IN RICHMOND DISTRICT
Bazaar to Be Held for the Purpose of
Raising Funds for Erecting
Building.
Preparations for the fancy bazaar to be
held in the armory of Company O, League
of the Cross Cadets, for the benefit of St.
John's' Church building, fund, are nearly
completed. The pretty booths are receiv
ing finishing touches by fair hands and
the hall has taken on a gala appearance.
The bazaar will be opened on Thursday
evening and the enthusiastic members of
the parish can hardly restrain the joy
they anticipate in displaying the beauti
ful and useful articles that will be offered
for sale.
An excellent entertainment has been ar
ranged for the Initial evening of the fair.
Supervisor Peter J. Curtis will act as
chairman. Frank T. Shea, the well
known architect, will deliver the oration,
and there will be vocal. and instrumental
music and specialties by Miss Annie
Rooney, Miss Etta Walsh, Miss Sadie Mc-
Ilugh and William Hynes.
The bazaar will be nttingly announced
to the public through an entertainment
and dance to be given In aid of St. Pat
rick's booth to-morrow evening In Mission
Opera Hall, Mission street, between Seven
teenth and Eighteenth. That the fair
will be a success is assured. The mem
bers of the parish under the direction of
Rev. Father Brady, their popular pastor,
are working with enthusiasm. Their
parish is the only one In this city without
a church. At present the residents of the
Mission road and vicinity are using the
old St. Mary's College building for a place
of worship. The fear that the .grounds
and buildings might be sold any 1 day has
encouraged the parishioners to give the
bazaar. The money derived from the af
fair will be devoted to erecting an edifice
adjoining the handsome parochial house
on St. Mary's avenue. The following com
mittees are working for the success of the
"bazaar:

ST. JOHN'S PARISH TO
HAVE ITS OWN CHURCH
INVITATION ON A GOLD
PLATE FOR PRESIDENT
The appellant declares that the results
of the bond elections were never declared,
as provided by the general law. He as-*
errts that the records show that the work
was lut half done. The returns were
canvassed and the number of votes esti
mated, but there the Board of Election
CommiFpioners stopped. The result, he
says, should have been officially declared.
Several strong points are made in the I
attack upon the action of the city ofllelals.
It is argued that in tht- call for the special
election the elector was not specially in
formed as to what the election was to be
for, as required by the State law. The
kind of money In which the bonds shall
be payable also was not stated. The ba^is
of the second ground for enjoining the
defendants was that the propositions for
the acquisition of thrfe separate and
widely divided tracts of land wore con
solidated on the election ballot and gavÂ»
the elector no opportunity of expressing
his opinion for or against either proposition
separately. Another point -made Is that in
the new charter there is no enabling
clause authorizing the legislative body,
created by the charter, to gather up the !
loose ends of proceedings inaugurated but |
not completed by the legislative body Â«x-
istlng prior to the adoption of the charter. I
oi nones.
The appellant's opening brief In the case
of Eugene N. Fritz against the City and
County of San Francisco has been filed
In the Supreme Court by Arthur Barendt
and Charles E. Naylor. It is an appeal
from a judgment sustaining the demurer
to a complaint In an -lction by Sir. Fritz,
in 'which lie sought to restrain the Mayor
and Supervisors from proceeding furthtr
in the matter of issuing city bonds .for
certain contemplated public Improve
ments. These proposed Improvement!)
were the purchase of land for a park ex
tending from Market street to Golden
Gate Park, known as the Panhandle ex
tension, the connection of Golden Gato
Park with the Presidio reservation, and

Miscellaneous Business.
The Dumbarton Land and Improvement
/Company submitted to the board the
Hands owned by It in Alameda
and Santa Clara counties for the purpose
of investigating the same for a source cf
supply of artesian water for this city. The
company owns about 21.000 acres of land
having *a frontage of seventeen miles on
the bay. The flow from ten-inch artesian
wells 00 the lands without pumping or
forcing water is about 5("K) gallons per
minute from each well. As wells can be
drilled on any portion of the land an un
limited supply of water can be obtained,
which could be pumped direct to San
Francisco or Ftnred in reservoirs in the
hills between Warm Springs and Mllpitas.
The ufff-r was referred to the Public
l"tiikk'Â« Committee.
The Board of Public Works will proceed
immediately to the investigation and sur
vey of Lake Tahoe as an available source
ui water bupply for this city. The Board
of bupervifcora indefinitely postponed a
resolution yesterday which directed the
Board of Works not to carry out the pro
posed Investigation. As a consequence the
eun-ertng paxty appointed heretofore,
â¢which bas been awaiting the action of the
Supervisors, will proceed with its work at
once.
fcurervisor McCarthy explained that he
had introduced the resolution in order to
have the legal flatus of tho case deter
mined and idso %> ascertain whether the
State had any right to go out of Its con-
I'.iies to secure water rights, and whether
the city has any Jurisdiction at all In the
premises. He was opposed, he said, to the
city going to any expense until these
points had been settled, and he moved
reference of the resolution to the City At
torney.
Supervisor Reed read a long report of
the public utilities committee In which in
detiiiiie postponement of the resolution
was recommended. Reasons were ad
vanced why the Tahoe Investigation
f hould be prosecuted at or\ce. He said the
engineers had reported In favor . of the
project and that the plain charter pro
visions had been followed la ordering the
Inquiry.
"Thtr time Is short." 6ald Reed, "and
the iilans as outlined should be carried
out immediately. The Public UtilitiesCom
rr.ittr-e merits the confidence of this board,
as it has conscientiously performed Its
duties as prescribed by the charter."
Supervisor Brandenstein argued that
very little additional expense would be in
curred In investigating the Tahoe system
as well as that of the American River and
1t> advocated the indefinite postponement
of tne resolution, which was agreed to.

INVESTIGATION
OF LAKE TAHOE
TO BE PRESSED
"Thirty pupils in primary grades and
forty in grammar grades are quite as
many as one teacher can be expected to
teach, and teach well."
A. M. Raub, Ph.D., principal of the
State Normal School, LocUhaven, Pa.,
says:
"Medium-sired cjasses in public schools
are the best. Where it is possible classes
should contain from ten to twenty pupils
each. In primary studies a smaller class
is not objectionable, as the attention of
the younger children is more liable to
wander and with them the larger the class
the more difficult the task of holding the
attention of pupils."
"Should the board decline to be con
vinced by the authorities which I will
bring to bear on low enrollment," said
Superintendent Webster, "I will certainly
take steps to establish my authority in
the premises. My attorney has not yet
advised me how to proceed. The whole
subject hinges on whether the board or
myself Is to be obeyed in the classifica
tion. A certain principal proceeded to
carry out my order on the subject, but
was peremptorily ordered by the board to
comply with its directions. The matter
mlght'be brought to a focus if some prin
cipal should refuse to obey the board.
That bodv would then most likely use its
hlgh-hantled precedent of suspending the
principal for insubordination and I would
proceed to protect him in his position. At
any rate the controversy must be settled
one way or the other and that very soon.
Webster has directed Deputies Kings
bury and Howard to compile opinions of
prominent educators on the subject of
classification. From data already ob
tained Webster says that his schedule is
excessive, as it appears to be the consen
sus of opinion that the lower the number
of pupils in a class the better the results.
After the opinions have been all gathered
Webster will submit them to the board
in an endeavor to have it change its
base. He says that the board has failed
to show its authority to classify grades
and has made rules on the subject which
are in opposition to his orders. Among
the opinions to be submitted to the board
is one from P. A. Barnett. head master
of the Training College for Schoolmasters,
London. England, who says:
"A practical class in science under one
teacher should not exceed from twenty
to twenty-five pupils, and forty should in
my opinion be the absolute limit of any
class whatsoever taught by one person."
J. T. Prince, Inspector of Schools for
the State of Massachusetts, says:
Superintendent Webster has decided that
he will bring the controversy existing be
tween himself and the Board of Educa
tion over the classification and grading of
schools to an issue. Just how the matter
Is to be settled has not yet been fully de
termined by Mr. Webster's legal adviser,
but it Is the latter's opinion that In some
way or other the court will ultimately
pass on the contention of the Superin
tendent that he alone has the power to
grade and classify schools, which is vest
ed in him by the Political Code. He re
cently issued an order directing an en
rollment not to exceed forty-live pupils in
the first, eighth and advanced eighth
grades, and Hfty in the second to the sev
enth grades, both inclusive. The schedule
as promulgated by the Board of Education
provides for an enrollment, respectively,
of fifty and fifty-five pupils in the grades
namii.

WEBSTER WILL
INSIST ON HIS
CLASSIFICATION
"As things are now," said Wells, "we
are in a very unsettled state. Until the
Board of Equalization meets we will not
know the rate for State taxation. Some
of the funds are already exhausted, nota
bly that of the City and County Hospital,
and we are less than two months into
the new fiscal year. All the funds will
necessarily have to be reapportloned. but
the tax levy of course will stand. I knew
all along that this tangle would resuit.
but the Mayor would not heed my warn
ing. The rate of $1.0758 is for current ex
penditures of the city government and
does not include those of the park, sink
ing and interest funds, which are specially
pro%'lded for by the charter. The money
to be derived from taxation might just
as well be apportioned in September,
when we know the State rate, as before
the beginning of the fiscal year. The
Finance Committee will tackle the ques
tion in a few days and the task of re
adjustment will be no easy one."
The sections of the State revenue law
and the charter referring to the apportion
ment of the tax levy clash, and the de
partment chiefs will have to make appli
cation to the Board of Supervisors for
more money. The State law says that the
(ax levy and appropriations must be made
on the third Monday in September in each
year. The new charter calls for the same
action to be taken on the third Monday in
May. This year the Supervisors, despite
the protest of Auditor Wells, fixed the
levy in May at 1.075S on a valuation of
$375,000,000. A short time afterward As
sessor Dodge reported that the assessment
roll was S405,00o,00O, but on inspection by
Wells the amount was< found to be $10,
000.000 short, a clerical error being re
sponsible for the difference. The State
tax cannot be known until September.
The total amount of money, therefore, to
be spent for the running of the city and
county cannot be known until that time.
The makers of the charter evidently
framed this section of the instrument on
a law existing In 1870, which calls for the
fixing of the levy in June. In 1S95 this was
amended to read September. This amend
ment was evidently overlooked and may
cause much bother. The Auditor will
bring the matter to the attention of the
Board of Supervisors.
Auditor "Wells is worked up over what
he holds to be a serious error in the chnr
ter. The result may be a revision of many
acts of the Board of Supervisors.

Chapter Relating to Tax
McCarthy's resolution directing the
Chief of Police to stop blasting operations
by Gray Bros, if no legal permit could be
produced by the firm was adopted.
The ordinance limiting the height of
.fences to twenty feet to be in force until
\he ten-foot ordinance becomes a law on
July 1, 1901. was defeated. Acting Mayor
Tobin explained that there was no ordin
ance at present limiting the height of
fences and that they could be constructed
as high as people paw fit. On that show
ing Dwyer moved for a reconsideration
and the ordinance will be taken up again
at the next meeting.
The City Attorney was directed to ascer
tain if Gray Bros, had legally succeeded
tb a personal permit to carry on blasting
operations in the vicinity of the rock
crusher.
The resolution presented by the Street
Committee denying the protest of the
West of Castro Street Improvement Com
pany against the maintenance of Gray
Bros.' rock crusher at Clipper and
Douglass streets was defeated after a mo
tion to postpone indefinitely had been lost.
A number of residents in the vicinity ad
dressed the board and repeated their testi
mony given before the Street Committee
that the crusher was a nuisance and
thould be abated. George Gray, a mem
ber of the firm, stated that everything
possible had been done to keep the dust
from spreading, and that the firm was
willing to correct any abuses that might
exist. To this a resident replied that the
dust had never been confined and that the
rocks from the blasting carried on by the
firm had crashed through houses and
broken many windows.
Brandensteln opposed the report of the
committee and moved as an amendment
that the rock crusher be declared a nui
sance. McCarthy admitted that Gray
Bros, had tried to ameliorate the condi
tions as they existed in the vicinity of the
crusher, but it was evident that their ef
forts had met with little or no success.
Trouble Over Bock-Crusher.
Resolved, By the San Francisco Labor Coun
cil. In regular session assembled, Augaiat 17,

continuance of this legalized s-y&tem of ex
cmslve, unhealthy and unnatural toil and ear
nestly requests the board to reduce materially
the maximum hours in which the laundry em

will serve to protect this class of employes
from the Imposition of such onerous and ex

Whereas. The hours of labor required of the
laundry workers of this city, authorised under

oi the fact that women, girls and children con
etltute 65 per cent of sajd employes; and
A petition from the San Francisco Labor
Council was presented at the meeting of
the Board of Supervisors yesterday. In
It a strong plea is made for a reduction in
the hours of la.undry employes. An ap
peal was made that an ordinance be
passed providing that the hours of such
employes be from 6 a. m. to 7 p. m. The
petition, which was referred to the Ju
diciary Committee, reads as follows:

The ordinance imposing a license tax
of $5 to $10 per quarter, according to the
amount of business done, on places that
sell liquors in quantities exceeding one
quart to be drunk on the premises, was
finally passed by the Board of Super
visors yesterday. The ordinance is in
tended to compel concert halls and un
derground resorts to pay a license tax,
which they have hitherto evaded. The
proposed measure developed some
opposition. which prompted Super
visor Comte, its author, to' ar
raign in scathing terms the Midway
Plaisance, which, he said, had remained
open in defiance of the Supervisors and
the Police Department.
"This ordinance is Intended to put such
disreputable places under the supervision
of the police," said Comte. "The Midway
1 laisance is a notorious example of an
open violation of the law. Though its
permit has been withdrawn it has evaded
the law by selling liquor in quantities
greater than one quart. Such iniquities
should be stopped in the interest of decent
government."
A motion to postpone consideration for
one week was lost and the ordinance was
then finally passed, only Boxton and Reed
voting against it. Existing orders relat
ing to the sale of liquor in quantities less
than one quart to be drunk on the prem
ises are not affected by the ordinance.
Will Be Called Duboce Park.
An ordinance was passed to print nam
ing the public square bounaed Dy Waller,
Kidley, Steiner and Scott streets "Du
boce Park." The ordinance was intro
duced on the petition of the New Park
Improvement Club, which asked that the
park be so named In honor of the memory
of the late Colonel Duboce. The petition
was signed by E. C. Priber, president;
Charles Boxton, vice president, and C. B.
Perkins, secretary.
The board was also informed that the
club will place a 100-foot flagstaff in the
park and a (lag will be raised on Septem
ber 9 with music and speeches.
Money for Native Sons.
A resolution introduced by Curtis that
the sum of $3000 be appropriated out of
the urgent necessity fund as the city's
contribution to the Native Sons' semi
centennial celebration this year was
passed to print.
A resolution was introduced providing
that contingent upon the reconstruction
of its roadbed and cable alley-way in the
near future, the Presidio and Ferries Rail
way Company be required to temporarily
set back lour feet the south curb of Union
street, between Hyde and Larkin. and to
pavq this strip with basalt blocks, pro
vided that upon rebuilding its roadbed the
company shall remove its tracks to the
center line of the street and restore the
strip to the sidewalk in front of Mrs. A. Â£.
Reynolds" premises from which it was re
moved. , *Â¦ -.-
The protest of Mrs. Reynolds against
the passage of the resolution was read.
She opposed ths recommendation of the
committee to take away four feet more
of her sidewalk. Fontana made a plea
for the Union-street road, which he said,
was a great convenience to the section it
traversed. He claimed It would be an in
justice to compel the road to go to a great
expense to move its tracks on the block.
On Reed's motion the resolution was post
poned for one week that the company
might be heard from as to when it will
reconstruct its line so as to place Its
tracks In the center of the street, between
Hyde and Larkin streets.
Reed informed the board that the Pub
lic Utilities Committee would meet this
evening to decide on the municipal light
ing system to be submitted to the people
The committee will also consider the al

Railroad Company. In 1Â»72 the city by
ordinance granted to the company the
right of way on Alameda street and soon
thereafter the corporation laid a single
track along the thoroughfare. Double
tracks were laid by the company In 1893
and a number of property owners Joined
with the city in an action to restrain and
prevent the company from continuing the
use of double tracks, the contention being
that having placed a single track It had
exhausted its power and right under the

& PATENTS ; ULet us first follow the fortunes of Hen
nepin. Brave and adventurous though
he undoubtedly was, he shrank from un
dertaking this trip when it was first pro
posed to him. But after it was all over
in writing about It he said: "Anybody but
me would have been very much frightened
at the dangers of such a journey." On
the last day of February, 16S0, he and
two companions bade good-by to their
comrades, entered their canoe and started
down the river. Without mishap they
reached Its point of junction with the Mis
sissippi, then turning northward they pad
dled up over the previous course of Joliet
and Marquette as far as the mouth of the
Wisconsin River, above which they en
tered an unexplored region. One dayâ the
11th or 12th of Aprilâ while on land cook
ing a turkey for dinner they were sud
denly surrounded by a war party of 120
Sioux Indians. They were at orree cap
tured and carried up the river by the sav
ages. For some time they were In doubt
as to the fate In store for them. Earnest
discussions on this subject were held by
the savages, some wishing to sacrifice
them, others speaking In their favor. They
passed through Lake Pepin. and nineteen
days after thÂ»ir capture landed near the
present site of St. Paul. Hennepin was
now adopted as a son by an Indian chief
and taken off to his village on the shore
of a small lake, which Is believed to have
been Mille Lac, from which the short Rum
River flows into the Mississippi. This was
the most northern point which he reached.
Early in the summer the Indians started
off on a grand buffalo hunt, and Henne
pin went with them down the Rum River
to the Mississippi. Here, through the^ in
tervention of a friendly chief, he and one
of his companions secured their liberty
In a small canoe they went down the river
and soon reached the falls which Henne
pin named after his patron. St. Anthony
of Padua. He described the falls as be
ing then forty or fifty feet high, but great
changes have occurred in recent years as
is well known. After several months, dur
ing which they had many adventures but
made no farther discoveries, they made
ther way to Green Bay. The following
springâ 1GS1 â Hennepin went by the lake
route to Montreal, where he was well re
ceived by Governor Frontenac. He ap
pears to have had no further dealings
\vlth La Salle, but after the death of the
latter published a revised account of his
own adventures, which was calculated to
SJdifdue^S. eXPl Â° rer Ot S Â° me OI the
We now return to La Salle. On the day
BivJr^ n ? e i Pln started down the Illinois
?i5 7 ' ' on . Marr *â¢ 16S0-La Salle
and five companions set out from Fort
Crevecoeur on the long and dreary jour
ney of about 1000 miles to Fort Fronte
nac, in Canada. They proceeded up the
river for some distance with great diffi
culty on account of the Ice. When a few
miles below the present site of Joliet they
left their canoes and struck across the
country on foot, wading through marshes
and inundated meadows, floundering over
the prairie deep In mud, until they reach
ed the mouth of the St. Joseph. Thence
they tramped across Southern Michigan,
enduring great hardships from exposure
to wet and cold, and some danger from
tha Indians. Reaching Lake Erie, they
made a canoe in which they paddled to
Niagara, and thence made their way to"
Fort Frontenac, where they arrived on
the 6th of May, after "the most arduous
journey," says the chronicler, "ever made
by Frenchmen In America."
Tt seemed best now for the explorers to
remain where they were for the rest of
the winter. So a fortified inclosure was
made, within which lodgings were built
for the party. This was the first civilized
settlement in the State of Illinois. It was
called Fort Crevecocur. and was not far
from Peoria, on the other side of the river.
The white men repeated their prayers
dally, chanted vespers on Sunday and
tried to convert the Indians. For worldly
occupation they set to building a ship
about the size of the ill fated Griffin, In
tending to use it in going down the Missis
sippi. As spring approached La Salle de
cided to go himself with a few men to
Canada to get the rigging needed for this
ship. While he was absent Hennepin was
to explore the lewer course of the Illinois
and perhaps go up thelMississippl. Tonty
and most of the men were to stay and
complete the hull of the ship, which was
now half-finished.
IX.
(Concluded.)
the opening of the Mississippi would turn
securely to France a trade which was
capable of indefinite expansion. It was a
â¢ far-seeing plan, and to the realization of
it he henceforth bent all his energies.
It now became necessary for him to re
i turn to Canada and prepare once more
for the exploration of the Mississippi to
' its mouth. Late in May he went to Mich
i illlmackinac. there met Tonty, and with
; him repeated the long journey of a thou
| sand milea by way of the lakes to Fort
I Frontenac. Here he found that his af
; fairs.. a5 usual, had suffered greatly
| through faithlessness of agents and Jeal-
I ousy of enemies. He put them in shape
I as well as he could, collected a band of
i thirty Frenchmen and the necessary In
dian attendants, and early in the autumn
of 1SS1 he set out for the third time to
reach the mouth of the Mississippi. HÂ«*
i went by way of Lake Simcoe and Geor
! glan Bay to Michlllimacklnac. then down
! to Fort Miami, where he reorganized his
j expedition, making it smaller. Late in
I December he crossed the southern end
j of the lake to the Chicago River, pad
i died up the stream, crossed overland to
I the northern branch of the Illinois and
I descended that to Us mouth, reaching the
Mississippi February 6. 16S2.
After some delay the explorers pro
ceeded down the river until, on the IZw.
! of March, they found themselves among
[ the Arkansas Indians, who treated them
with great kindness and civility. They
' had now reached the lowest point visited
I by Joliet and Marquette. They kept on
' down the river until, on the 6th of April,
i It divided into three broad channels. Thoy
had reached the head of the delta. The
! expedition was now divided into three
I portions, so that the three channels were
, traversed to the gulf, where the canoea
I all came together again. The party land
! ed. and amid volleys of musketry ami
â¢ shouts of "Vive le roll" La Salle named
! the country "Louisiana," after Louis XIV.
; and took possession of it In the name of
; the King. A properly Inscribed column
! was set up and a leaden plate bearing The
I arms of France was buried tn the soil.
â¢ The Mississippi had now been traced from 2
I MiUe Lac in Minnesota to the Gulf of
, Mexico, and the whole river, with all In
Â¦ tributaries and the vast regions which
they drained was added to the realms of
France.
Returning to the Illinois River. La Sal 1 *
built Fort St. Louts on the top of
i "Starved Rock," a short distance above
| the mouth of the VermMion River. In the
l plain below he gathered 4000 Indian war
riors with their families and a few whlio
I settlers. This was the beginning of a
colony, but the permanent success depend
ed upon the establishment of communi
cation with France by way of the Mlssis
! sippl. for the Canadian authorities* wen
bitterly opposed to the enterprise. La
Salle accordingly determined to go to
France to lead an expedition by sea lo
the mouth of the Mississippi, to build a
fort there and garrison it, then go up the
river to his colony.
The flrstpart of this plan he carried out.
Going to France he secured the approval
of the King, and on July 24, 1BS4. set sail
| from Rochelle with an expedition of four
I ships. After some delay In the Wesc
! Indies the voyagers sailed south of Cuba:
I they struck across the gulf In a north-
I westerly direction and reached the coast
! of the continent near the mouth of tho
i Sabine River. Supposing that they were
j east of the Mississippi they turned west
' ward and anxiously scanned the shore for
i the mouth of the river. At last La Salie
thought he had found it. and the expedi
tion was landed at Matagorda Bay. on the
coast of Texas. The largest ship now re
turned to France and the others were lost,
j so that the wretched colonists were left
quite helpless, stranded on an unknown
I coast. Here they remained for two year*,
their number constantly dwindling until
none were left. During this time La Salle
made several efforts to find the river, but
without success, and was finally killed by
one of his men on the 19th of March, 1W7.
Thus perished the great explorer at tho
age of 43. As we read of his marvelous
journeys, mostly by canoe and on foot,
over many thousand miles of wilderness,
of his utter indifference to extreme pri
vation and discomfort, and of the heroism
with which he endured the machinations
of enemies and the reverses of fortune,
rising superior to them all, we are im
pressed with the conviction that hia was
one of the most intrepid spirits of whom
we have any record. The historian Park
man says: "America owes him an endur
ing memory, for In his masculine figure
she sees the pioneer who guided her to
the possession of her richest heritage."

DISCOVERERS AND E^C FÂ»I_OR E RS Of NORTH
AiY\ERlCA,
It is Intended to provide free transpor
tation to and from the coast and general
entertainment for the passenger agents
while the convention is in this city and
State. The prospect of securing the -cov
eted prize Is very promising. The fight
to bring the convention here will be made
at the annual convention of the associa
tion, which will be held at Old Point Com
fort, Va., in September.
"If we can convince the men of tho
East that these things are not dreams and
that their beautifj; and comforts can he
theirs we will accomplish mighty things
for California. I know of no class of men
who can do so much good for this State
as can these passenger agents, and that
is why the railroad men of all the lines
are eager to secure the next convention
for San Francisco. I sincerely hope their
efforts will be successful."
"These are the things it is particularly
desirable that the traveling passenger
agents should see and experience. The
Santa Fe and the Southern Pacific com
panies have extended a cordial invitation
to these hustling gentlemen to come here
and let us take them through the beauti
ful vales, over the high mountains, by our
magnificent lakes and rivers, and through
our hospitality impress them with the ex
istence of the exceptional wonders of this
wonderful State.
As an experiment we have been, dur
ing the terrible heated spell of the East,
wiring Eastern newspapers figures on
temperature here in San Francisco. As
a result the remarkable comparison of
heat and comfort has blockaded the side
walks of the Eastern cities with interest
ed and suffering people watching the bul
letins. To them the facts seem almost
preposterous. They cannot believe that
within a few hours' ride east or nortn
of this point we can find eternal snows,
while here it is never too hot or too cold;
that a few hours south are places where
one can bathe in the surf with comfort
from the 1st of January till the 31st of
December.
"How can you describe the Yosemite?
When you tell an Easterner who knows
that Niagara has a fall of 183 feet that
Bridal Veil is 1360 feet, sheer plunge: that
the falls of Yosemite take a leap of 2800
feet and touch but one projecting rock in
that distance, you need not be astonished
at his look of fine scorn.
"Or when you stand him in the vicinity
of one of the big trees, whether Cala
veras, Wawona or others, and pointing
out one like the Grizzly Giant, tell him
that that tree was more than 6000 years
old when our Savior was born, and that
it and its companions are the oldest living
things on this broad earth, can you blame
him for being incredulous? He would not
believe that the first limb on one of the
monsters is 125 feet from the ground and
that its girth is so great that a coach and
four could be accommodated upon it. Yet
seeing is believing, and that is why we
want these bright talkers and boomers to
come to the coast.
'The Traveling Passenger Agents' As
sociation is a social organization wholly,"
said Passenger Traffic Manager McCor
mick of the Southern Pacific. "They are
intelligent, capable and energetic, and all
the railroad men of the coast want them
to come out here. If we can get them to
come to God's land we will send back to
the populous Kast so many hundred
walking, talking delegates for California,
its climate, resources,, beauty of scenery
and other attractions, which are difficult
to describe to Eastern men and not ap
pear to be telling an untruth. As matter
of fact, he fully believes that you are ly
ing, and the closer you get to the truth
the more he is convinced that you are a
Munchausen.
It is the business of these' agents to in
struct the thousands of ticket agents of
the various lines how and where to ad
vise people to go and what sections to ad
vocate in particular. This is why their
presence in thi3 State is so much desired.
All the railroad men in the city are In
terested in the plan to induce the Associa
tion of Traveling Passenger Agents of the
United States to hold their convention
next year in San Francisco. The organi
zation is the greatest aggregation of trav
eling advertisers in the world, and It is
extremely desirous that they should come
to this city and State and acquaint them
selves with the varied charms and re
sources of the golden commonwealth and
its great metropolis.
Their Visit to San Francisco Would
Certainly Result in Great
Benefit to the City and '
State.

The British ship Hyderabad arrived
from Antwerp yesterday after a good pas
sage of 146 days. As she sailed up tho
bay the little ship Portsmouth, rigged as
the Marion by Uoatswains' Mate Koley,
gave her a brush. The minature craft
ran rings around her rival and proved
herself the fastest little thing ever Been
In the bay.
Tho Portsmouth was the United States
man-of-war that was in port on Admis
sion day, 1850, and the Naval Battalion in

parade on September 10.
The Hyderabad had some heavy weather
during her run to port. Captain Scott
says that on June 12 it was blowing, a
heavy gale and the next day it had in
creased to a hurricane. Everything move
able on deck was washed away and many
of the sails were split. The storm was
accompanied by rain and snow and the
men suffered a great deal. On July 2<i
another storm was run into and from that
on the ship had fair weather. The Hyder
abad was three days off the Golden Gata
and could not get in owing to light winiis
and calms.

Neither the State Laws Nor Congress
Has Exempted Them by Special
Mention.
United States Circuit Judge Morrow
handed down a decision yesterday dis
missing the action of J. C. Harper against
J. P. Endert and Fred Frantz to enjoin
the defendants from collecting tolls from
the plaintiff as carrier of United States
mails from Crescent City, Del Norte
County, to Grants Pass. Or. Judge Mor
row decided that section 2814, Political
Code of California, enumerates those per
sons exempt from the payment of tolls,
and among those the carriers of United
States malls are not specifically men
tioned. Neither has Congress exempted
them, and the case was therefore dis
missed.
Similar action was taken with regard to

pretty, was kidnaped from Eureka and
taken on the steamer to San Francisco

Thence he went down Lake Michigan, up
the St. Joseph, across to the Kankakee
and down that to the Illinois, thus re

"While he was on this Journey a gTeat

village was reached. "Where the 460 lodges
had stood the year before none were now
left. The whole was a scene of savage
destruction and desolation. Anxious
about Tonty, La Salle went on down the
river to Its Junction with the Mississippi.
He now for the first time beheld the great
river which had played such an impor
tant part in his hopes and plans. But he
had no time to explore it. Retracing his
course, he continued his search for Tonty.
and finally reached the St. Joseph again,
but had no word of the fate of his friend,
nor was It until the following March that
he heard of his escape and saXe arrival
at Green Bay.

BREAD DYSPEPSIA.
The Ingesting 1 Element L.eft Out.
Bread dyspepsia is common. It af-
fects the bowels because white bread is
nearly all starch, and starch is digested
in the intestines, not in the stomach
proper. Up under the shell of the
â¢wheat berry, Nature has provided a
curious deposit which is turned into
diastase when it is subjected to the
saliva and to the pancreatic juices in the
human intestines.
This diastase is absolutely necessa^r
to digest starch and turn it into grape
sugar, which is the next form; but that
part of the wheat berry makes dark
m t our. and the modern miller cannot
w readily seH dark flour, so Nature's valu-
able difcestor is thrown out and the hu-
nan system must handle the starch as
best it can, without the help that Na-
ture intended. 'BBSS.
Small wonder that appendicitis, perit-
onitis, constipation and all sorts of
trouble exist, when we go so contrary
to Nature's law. The food experts that
perfected Grape-Nuts Food, knowing
these facts, made use. in their experi-
ments, of the entire wheat and barley,
including all the parts, and subjected
them to moisture, and lonj? continued
â¢warmth, which allows time and the
proper conditions for developing the
diastase, outside of the human body.
In this way the starchy part is trans-
formed into pxape sugar in a perfectly
natural manner, without the use of
chemicals or any outside ingredients.
The little sparkling crystals of srape
sugar can be seen on the pieces of Grape
Nuts. This food therefore is naturallv
predif?eÂ«ted and its use in place of bread
-K-ill quickly correct the troubles that
have been brought about bv the too free
v\<- of. starch in the food, and that is
r A v corrirnon ' n t^ ie . human race to-dav.
â¢^The effect of eatinj? Grape Nuts ten
days or two weeks, and the discontinu-
ance of ordinary white bread, is very
marked. The user will cain rapidly in
strength and physical and mental health.

SUICIDE OF ANIMALS.
"It Is said that man is the only animal
who perspires all over, laughs, and com
mits suicide." remarked a resident of the
lower coast. "The suicide claim has been
disputed, however, and I can furnish a
little evidence on the subject myself
Down near the mouth of the river the
mosquitoes are at times a pest of a very
formidable character, and If they are any
worse in the Klondike I wouldn't go there
for enough gold to start a brick yard
They come In swarms so dense that they
look like clouds of black smoke, and
when they make a descent, there is noth
ing to do but beat a retreat. Of course
cattle suffer intensely, and the poor beasts
will become absolutely maddened by pain
The mosquitoes penetrate their ears and
nostrils, and on several occasions I have
seen cows and steers rtish into the river
ami to all appearances commit suicide bv
drowning. I mean that they wade into
comparatively shallow places and delib
erately hold themselves under water untfl"
life is extinct. Anybody who lives In the
neighborhood will bear out the assertion
and if the act is not intentional suicide it '
certainly has all its aspects. It is a com
mon thing to see cattle .run into the river
and submerge themselves until only their
noses protrude. Old settlers say they will 1
stand that way all night, and I know
from personal observation that they will
hold their position for hours at a time
It is a curious fact, by the way. that
some of the natives of the lower coast
are evidently immune to mosquito bites
Time and apain I have watched them
workin.sr in the fields with their trousers
rolled up to their, hips and nothing on the
unper part of the body but a sleeveless
shirt. The mosquitoe3 will buzz around
them in droves, but they will emerge from
the thick of it without a puncture They
have been living near the swamps for
generations and evolution must have pro
vided them with a stinsr-proof epidermis."

CLOSING
Excessive idleness In the markets here to
day caused universal heaviness except In cop
per shares, which were sustained by covering
of short contracts. Money was much easier;
call rates began at 2Vi per cent and soon became
nominal. Time money was 3 per cent; dis
counts 3% per cent. This ease is expected to
last to the end of the month. The Ind'.a Gov
ernment seems to be nibbling at silver.

Whatever may be the outcome of the Prune
AFs^ciatlon. one beneficial fact is already
establishedâ for the first time in years the
crower is managing his own market. Reports
from San Jose quote what the "growers"
think, what the "growers" want, and so
forth. In previous years it has been just the
other wav: very little has been heard from
the Erower, but a good deal from the buyer.
The grower is having his innings at last, after
having: been under the direction of the buyer
for too many years for his own good. If the
growers have nerve enoughâ and it begins to
look as if they have â to bo riÂ£ht along and fix
their own prices this year to suit themselves,
their pockets will be much heavier at the
close of the season than- In former years. They
are on the -right track thus far. at least.

hidden. He had earned It by slow process,
and from year to year had added to the
store until a very handsome nest egg was
accumulated. But never a dollar did the
old man expend except . for the barest
necessities. Indeed, he would deprive
himself of the most essential articles in
order to increase his savings, which now

CAPTAIN HENRY DE H. WAITE.
Rauer's statement was that Nypaard
called at his office and at once became
abusive, calling every one thieves and
robbers. The collector says he Â¦was !n aa
inner room and hearing the racket ramo
out and asked thÂ«> seaman what was the
matter, also telling him not to use such
language. Nygaard showed the receipt,
and after verifying it an apology Â¦was
made for the trouble he had been put to. 1
Nygaard became more abusive and the
boy. Clark, went to put him out. He
knocked the boy down and the clerk.
R. J. Graf, threw him out. Rauer denied
throwing the bottle of Ink and said he
did not know who threw It.
"I got a letter from Rauer last Mon
day." said Nygaard. "telling me to call
and settle the bill within a week, other
wise an action would be brought against
me. I could not call till to-day and gave
up my Job aa first mate to do so, as I did
not want a policeman coming to the
boat. The boat left this afternoon with
out me. I went to Rauer's office and
showed him the receipt. A young man
called me names and came and struck
me on the nose. He grabbed hold of me
'to throw me out. and just then Rauer
threw an ink bottle at me. which struck
me on the back of the head and covered
me with ink. It was thrown with such
force that It broke and I got my hand
cut with the glass."
Nygaard over a year ago owed a board
bill amounting to $27 70. It was placed
in Rauer's hands for collection, and on
September 16 of last year Nygaard paid
Rauer $12. getting a receipt In full, which
he fortunately kept. The amount above
the $27 70 was claimed by Rauer, Nygaard
says, as fees.
Nygaard was taken to the 'Receiving
Hospital to have his injuries attended to
and Rauer and his office boy, Walter
Clark, were taken to police headquarter3
by Policeman Walsh. They were detained
there till Nygaard was able to make hi3
appearance, and after both sides wera
heard Rauer was booked on a charge
of battery and released on J20 cash bail.
There was a lively scrap In Jaka
Rauer's office, on Sansome street, yes
terday afternoon, and Oluf Nygaard, first
mate on the steamer Point Arena, came
out of it with a lacerated wound on his
scalp, a broken nose, a swollen and cut
hand and his clothes and face covered
with Ink.

Mr. Fitchie said in addition that not
only were secret service officers informed
of this matter but the New York police
had information cf it from the Paris po
lice officials.
Assistant Secretary of the Treasury
Taylor left for Washington to-day. He
investigated while here the cases of the
two Italians Maresca and Gulda, but re
fused to say anything before reaching
Washington.
It was learned that suspicion as to the
coming of Maresca was inspired by rival
detective bureaus, who were anxious to
place the man under arrest on the
strength of an anonymous letter received
by the American Consul at Naples.
Commissioner Fitchle said that late
Sunday evening a letter waa received from
Consul Bylngton of Naples Inclosing a
cops of a letter dated August 2, in which
an anonymous writer stated that he had
overheard a conversation between
Maresca and another Italian in a saloon,
during which Maresca, who was intoxi
cated, paid he was about to sail for tht
United States to kill President McKinley.
The Consul added; according to Commis
sioner Fitchle, that he had cabled the in
formation to "Washington, and that he
had mailed copies of the letter to various
European ports and to ports of entry in
the United States giving a description of
Maresca.
NEW YORK. Ayg. 2O.-Maresca and
Gulda, the Italians suspected of being
anarchists and detained by the immigra
tion authorities, are still in the detention
boat Narragansett on Ellis Island.
Commissioner Fltchie said a search of
Maresca's baggage had not revealed any
documents oi an incriminating nature.
Gulda begged that the letters found in
his trunk and signed "Rosa" be restored
to him and his request was granted.
BERLIN. Aug. 20.â The German police
have agreed to stop all anarchist meet
ings in Germany and four have been sup
pressed in Berlin. It is said that 1S6'for
eign anarchists, of whom 103 are Italians,

d>ine to encourage resistance to American au
thority In the Philippines or elsewhere under
our flag. ,,
America had no thought of the Philippines
when she declared war against Spain. Unlike
all former territorial acquisitions they came
to us unsought. Thomas Jefrerson dispatched
eml?sarien to Paris to purchase the Territory
ot Louisiana from Napoleon, and they used
GVpny Â£nci**tivor to cfl rry oui thoir mission.
Texas became a part of the United States long
after its acquisition had been determined upon
by the adventurous Americans who Fettled upon
its soil and shed their blood In rearing and
maintaining- its lone star flag, California be
came part of the American Union because of
designs long contemplated and suecessfully
carried out. But the Island territories ac
quired from Spain were not the prizes of con
quest well planned and Ion* cherished. They
came as Â«he result of a war solely in the Inter
ests of humanity without any ulterior or selfish
motive.
When Dewey's suns shook the Spanish flag
from the cat>itol at Manila and destroyed the
;Â«wer of Spain to maintain law and order
there it became the duty of the Government
of the United States to supply that law and
order, and there has boon no time since when
the American forces could have been with
drawn . and law and order maintained ex
cept the task had been taken up by Ger
many or some other ambitious power. There
does not exist there, and there will not exist
thÂ«re for many years to come, the elements
out of which might be formed and maintained
an orderly and independent republican gov
ernment. As William McKinley said at Bos
ton, it seems that the hand of destiny placed
our -flag there, and I believe that it will stay
there until Its people are capable of. self-
Kovernment or until all of the Inhabitants of
the islands have made known their wishes to

zens, regardless of politics, to stand by
the administration and the flag. Other in

Sullivan, and will vote for McKinley and
Roosevelt.
Mr. Sullivan wrote the following letter
to T. C. Hogan, chairman of the Demo

resignation and explaining why he will
vote for William McKinley for President:
As I do not Intend to support the nominee of
the Democratic National Convention for the

it proper, at this time, to tender my resigna

Committee for this country.
Permit me to say that I am constrained to
take this course by the conviction that the atti
tude of the Democratic party toward those
questions growing out of the Spanish war Is
neither wise nor patriotic. I believe that the
ratification of the treaty of Paris was an act
of xvltdom. and that the President is entitled
to the support of the American people In the

WARM GREETING TO THE
NEW CLASS OF FRESHMEN
Yesterday morning Harry E. Corbett
and Thomas Wand, a telegraph operator
in his office, called with their attorney,
George D. Collins, upon Warrant Clerk
Peery. Collins produced a long typewrit
ten complaint charging Corbett with vio
lating section 1 of ordinance 86 against
poolsellinsr. He. according to Peery. rep
resented that Chief Sullivan consented to
the complaint being sworn to, as it was
to be a test case and would be brought
before the Superior Court at once. Peery
on that showing- "O K'd" the complaint
and It was sworn to by Wand before
Judge Conlan. Corhett was, at his re
quest, arrested by Policeman Dougherty
and booked at the City Prison, being re
leased on $."Â» cash bail.
Collins immediately obtained a writ of
habeas corpus before Judge Cook and it
was made returnable at It) o'clock, this
morning. A notice was served upon Chief
Sullivan, and he was surprised. He made
inquiry and learned from Warrant Clerk
Peery of the representation made by At
torney Collins that he had consented to
the arrangement, and he promptly laid
the matter before the District Attorney,
who will take steps this morning to have
the proceedings quashed.
"I did not give my consent," said thÂ»^
Chief, "as there Is a conviction by Judge
Mogan in a similar case against Corbett,
on which sentence will be pronounced to
morrow. Collins came to me Saturday
and said that Attorney Coffey had not. in
cluded in the complaint against Corbett
the facts, but had simply charged him
with violating the ordinance. He wanted
another arrest made on a complaint em
bracing the facts, and said if the police
would not do it he would have to do it
himself. I said 'All right; we cannot pre
vent you,' but that was not giving my
consent."
The complaint recites that on August IS
Corbett received from William Daley $10
deposit as a bet on Fltzsimmons in the
fight with Sharkey at Coney Island Au
gust 25. to be transmitted to San Jose,
and that Corbett after receiving 10 cents
commission from Daley transmitted the
bet by telegram to Osterhout In San Jose.
The second trial of Henry Schwartz by
jury is set for this afternoon at 2 o'clock,
and Attorney Collins notified Judge Con
lan yesterday morning that ttr. Kahn
would come into court and testify that
Schwartz was still too sic!; to be able to
appear. Attorney Coffey, for the prosecu
tion, suggested that Dr. Bazet should call
upon Schwartz and report as to his con
dition, but the Judge refused. Coffey
went to Chief Sullivan and the Chief saw
the Judge, who said he was willing that
a physician of the Board of Health should
call to examine Schwartz, but he should
have the naming of the physician, and
not the attorney for the prosecution. The
Chief said that would be satisfactory to
him, and the Judge will name the physi
cian this morning. Meantime a venire
for fifty talesmen has been Issued, and If
it is decided that Schwartz Is too sick to
come into court the case will have to be
continued. 'Â¦
The poolroom men have, according to
the police, taken a snap judgment on
them, but they declare it will not have
the effect or force expected, .as already
steps have been adopted to counteract the
scheme.

is certain of. and that is that he is wanted

CENTER-RUSH CUNHA IS
CALLED TO HONOLULU
five y.--ars. At the close of his remarks a
resolution was presented, declaring: that
the dub favor the passage of a similar
1Â« in this State. The resolution was re
f fared to a committee, which will be ap
pointed by the president.
Contractors Nickerson & Malley have
been declared â¢â¢fair." A. Kusch. contrac
tor on a 15000 Ftable for H. Butters in
Piedmont, has been declared "unfair."
The Twentieth Century Cluh of the;
First Unitarian Church listened to-night
to statements of the millmen's troubles
from representatives of both sides. Ed
ward J. Hassfurthor. proprietor of the
Lr-wis mill in San Francisco, ftated that
the cause of disagreement was the refu
sal of the ny'.l-workers' union to guaran
tee protection from northern mills work
ing ten and fourteen hours a day. He un
derstood the reason of thÂ»'ir refusal to.be
that the capital of these mills Is too large
to be fought against.
TV. C. Grairtund. a member of the Mill
workers' Union, said the men had organ
ized in April to secure shorter time, be
rause they were the only workers In con-
Dection with buildings who labored more
than eight hours a day. One Oakland
mill-owner, he said, at first induced his
men to unionize, but has since turned
arainst them.
itev. Benjamin Fay Mills, minister of
the church, presented the plan of com
pulsory arbitration, which has kept New
Zealand free fr.*m strike* during the last
Bl! union men; Â«h?rel">re be it
Resolved. That tbe Alameda County Fed
erated Trades extends Its sympathy to the
locked out tr.'.llmtn. and pledges itself to sup
port th*m in their trouble, morally and finan
cially, to the extent of their ability, and wilt
<\r, all in thfir power to assiet them in the set
tlement of t^eir difficultr-
Resolved. Further, that an engrossed copy cf
these resolutions be forwarded to the Mlil
ffi'ti'i Union, both of th!Â« city and San Fran
clsro. under the seal of the federation, signed
fives ja a position antagonistic to the vre:i

and

fuEÂ»s to. allow members of Its allied branches
to i'-rform any work on any structure that

Aan eUrtit hours per day: and
f Wherean. The demand of the m!Ilmen is Just
Ultf they ar* entitled to the hearty support of
V\'h"r*cf. The mnicwner*, in refuMnif the just

Whereas. The MillTnen's t'nlon of this city
ar.u county Â»nd of the city and county of Sa.n
Franci^o have made a demand for a shorter
"Conditions are favorable, in my judg

differences."
The Alampda County Federated Trades
has adopted the following resolutions:
OAKLAND. Aug. 20.â The millmen's
fight situation is unchanged. Whether the
Alamcda County Building Trades Council
will join in -he arbitration movement wit-h
Ea:i Franc's' o millmen Is a question not
yet settled. Business Agent J. H. Mullen
nnnounced to-day that the Alameda
County Council would act Independently
upon the matter and that it was in no way
bound by the actions of the council across
the- bay. Concerning the g-er.eral situation,
Mullen said:
Council Has Not Decided on
Arbitration Matter.
Alarneda County Building Trades
3 The council had its aK^nts out as usual
> yesterday an<1 the contractors are still
drawing the line on handling: non-union
goods. A load of stuff was delivered to
Crintractor^Jliller by the Kxcelslor Red
wood Company Saturday and yesterday
morninp: Mr. Miller telephoned the firm
to send a team around and take the goods
hack.
SEEKS INDEPENDENT ACTION.
Just what will be the basis of the Mer
chants" Association's plan of compromise
is uncertain, but there must necessarily
be concessions on both sides. Possibly the
arbitrating committee may strike a happy
medium, making the workday eight and
a half hours instead of eight. This would
give the men a half-hour noon rest as at
present. Instead of a whole hour as
planned under the eight-hour schedule.
Such a plan, however, might conflict with
The established rules of the National
Trades Union. A more likely scheme of
arbitration would be the protection of the
local industries from foreign competition
in the event of the eight-hour rule being
put in force.
The labor headquarters was crowded
with workmen last evening and all seemed
anxious for news. President McCarthy
sa!d th<? Building Trades Council was rest
ing on its oars pending action by the mill
owners and Mei chants' Association. Ho
said the council would bÂ«Â» willing to abide
by sr.y foir proposition from the board of
arbitration, and he was confident the mill
r.wners would look at the matter in the
f-nmc light. He thought both sides were
anxious for a speedy settlement.
. The Merchants' Association has not yet
neard from the Mill-owners' Association
relative to the plan suggested by the
builders for settling the trouble between
the mill-owners ana operatives. Member*
of the Merchants' Association have con
sented to act as arbitrators, and they will
draw up a plan of settlement just as soon
as the mill proprietors give their consent
to the proposition. There will be a meet
ing oither to-night or to-morrow evening
to discuss the matter. So far as can b<?
learned, there Is no pronounced opposi
tion to the plan.
ThÂ© mill-owners are Just now discussing
the possibility of the out-of-town mills
getting into the trouble as a matter of
assistance to the mills of the city, which
are bearing the brunt of the fight. Nego
tiations have been under way for some
time, but so far there ba.vÂ© been no re-
The scheme as reported was that all
nulls in the State should come together
to keep afloat the smaller mifjs of the city.

and tea hour schedule and the argument
waa that, if the strike In the city should
he successful, the next demand would be
tttar the eight-hour day must prevail liÂ»
? U VÂ° C t T Pt 'w mllls as wel1 as c ity mills.
And that the strike might be successfully
withstood, the out-of-town mills were to
cozne into the combination, and by ad
vancing funds Insure the defeat of thÂ«
strike m the city, thus guarding them
selves against future trouble nearer
home.

:wniirGdifl.iiowTnSeveral points of frreat importance were
established yesterday in the Townsend
case during the examination of Mrs. Ella
F. Murray before Judge Frank H. Dunne,
and before proceedings were stopped by
a writ of prohibition from the Supreme
Court. The atmosphere of the case has
been filled with rumors of wills, but It was
not until yesterday that a positive, defi
nite statement was madÂ© that Mrs. A. S.
Townsend had ever made a will. The as
sertion that the dead woman had made
insisted yesterday in escorting her to the
Grand Jury room. She is accused of no
crime and having been served with a sub
pena intended to obey the summons.
She looks upon the incident as persecu
tion and she and her friends are loud in
denouncing it.
Mrs. Murray Saw Her Mother's Will.
The association of Mrs. Smith with Col
onel George H. Pippy in the same office
Is Ftartling. and the police profess to take
from it a sinister meaning. Mrs. Smith
continues positively to deny that she had
p.nythlng to do with the bogu3 will. She
resents bitterly the fact that the police
could very readily have been demon
strated. If the document had been de
stroyed Miss Nellie Rattlgan might have
been asked on the witness Ptand if she
had ever seen a document purporting to
be a will of Mrs. Townsend. Her answers,
if truthfully given, would have brought
confusion to Mrs. Murray and her attor
neys. There is reason to believe, the au
thorities declare, that the will and the
envelopes Inclosing it were photographed
with this plan in view before they were
sent to Miss Rattlgan.
not only one will but two was made under
cross-examination by Mrs. Murray.
. The witness declared that when she was
a child she saw a will which her mother
had made and signed. Later, in 1SDS, her
mother told her that she had made a will,
but would not sign it until Mrs. Murray
had passed judgment upon it. Mrs. Mur
ray said that she had been consulted by
her mother in reference to the various
provisions of the testament and had
spoken. significantly to her Eastern rela
tives about it, but she had never seen the
instrument and had no knowledge that it
ever received the force of law by being
signed.
. These disclosures, which were in the na
ture of a surprise, settled the argument
that Mrs. Townsend never made a will
because of her superstition that she would

Mrs. Edna Stock Swallowed Opium
When She Heard Her Spouse
, Was in City.
Mrs. Edna Stock, residing at 426 Minna
street, took a dese of "yen she" with sui
cidal Intent last night. She was treated at
the Receiving Hospital for opium poison
ing and will recover.
Mrs. Stock learned yesterday that her
husband had returned from the Klondike.
She had been dissipating during his ab
sence and feared to meet him. Last night
she left her home to avoid him and visited
a saloon on the corner of Mary and Minna
streets. "While there some person whose
name is unknown to tho police gave her
the opium, which she took to end her ex
istence.
PREFERRED DEATH TO
*A HUSBAND'S REBUKE
"Did you not tell your aunt, Eliza Craw
ford, in 1SS5, that you had seen your moth
er's will and that in It your aunt and
other relatives had been liberally pro
vided for by your mother?"
"I did not tell my aunt anything of the
sort. I told her that on my visit here in
1S94 my mother had told me that she had
made her will, but would not sign It until
she had consulted me. She had taken
counsel with me In reference to the provi
sions of the will, but I most solemnly
swear that I never saw that testament if
It ever existed." N
Hassett triedÂ»Jna variety of ways to
induce the â¢witness to change this testi
mony, but he had absolutely no success
and an adjournment was taken for the
r.oon recess. Before court reconvened the
Supreme Court, upon the application of
Thomas T. Townsend, the divorced hus
band of Mrs. Townsend, issued a writ of
prohibition forbidding Judge Dunne to
proceed until the appellate tribunal passes
upon the merits of Townsend's applica
tion. :^.v
The ex-husband claims that Judge
Dunne has discriminated against him by
assigning his application for letters of ad
ministration for August 30 and then hear
ing the applications of the Public Admin
istrator and of Mrs. Ella F. Murray.
Townsend Insists that he has the right to
be heard at the same time as the other
applicants. His petition will be heard to
day at 2 o'clock by the Supreme Court. .
When Judge Dunne reopened court in
the afternoon he' was .informed of the
action of the Supreme Court by Attorney
J. F. Sullivan, whereupon the case was
continued until to-morrow morning. At

action in the matter.
die the day after making it They shed a
peculiar light also on the conduct of Mrs.
Murray in taking dramatic possession of
her mother's house and effects and insti
tuting a search for a will from which she
excluded every one except her own con
fidants.
Hassett Provokes a Sharp Betort.
Under, cross-examination Mrs. Ella F.
Murray attempted to relate the Incidents
of her life even from her earliest years.
The purpose of the Inquiry on the part
of Attorney Hassett was not plain
either to the court or to the other at
torneys. It was long, wearisome and un
interesting. Finally the attorney for the
Public Administrator unburdened himself
and declared that It was necessary for
Mrs. Murray to prove not only a bona.flde
residence In California, but also her al
leged relationship to Mrs. Townsend. The
pleadings In the case accepted as a fact
that Mrs. Murray is the daughter of Mrs.
Townsend. It was not readily understood
therefore why Hassett insisted upon ask
ing questions which apparently had abso
lutely no bearing on the case. As a law
yer Hassett is, however, wonderfully and
fearfully made and he pursued his policy
until peremptorily overruled by the court.
In pursuing his Inquiry Attorney Has
sett became positively original in a cer
tain peculiar way. In apparent sincerity
he asked Mrs. Murray:
"Have you any knowledge of the mar
riage of your mother and father from a
recollection of the event?"
The attorney meant no Insult. It was
his peculiar way of expressing himself.
He did not realize that he had commit
ted a blunder until he was awakened by
a general laugh In the courtroom and
the answer of Mrs. Murray, which was:
"No, sir; I have not. I was not present
at the ceremony."
Mrs. Murray has a habit and a faculty
of giving sharp answers, and when she
made this one she was in her test mood, i
She then related the incidents of her early
life, telling where she lived and with
whom. Practically nothing of importance
was developed. Mrs. Murray said that
she lived with her mother in New York in
a tenement house In 1S39, and also In a
lodging-house which Mrs. Townsend kept
before she came to California in the ship
Baltic. Mrs. Murray also told what she
knew- of the relations of her mother and
father during her early years, and il
lustrated the fact that her parents even
then were not friendly. She declared that
she lived with her grandmother until the
latter's death: The answer seemed to bt
plain enough, but it was apparently not
so with Attorney Hassett.
"When did you cease to live with your
grandmother?" he repeated.
"When she died." was the reply. "I
have not lived with her since."
Consulted With Her Mother About
Bequests.
Attorney Hassett tried another tack.
"Did you ever see a will made and signed
by your mother?" he asked.
"I did," was the answer. "I saw one
when I was a little girl. It was made by
Judge Pond and signed by my mother.
That was long before -my marriage In
to make. If the bojrus will had been of

Urs. Smith Accused of tlie Fraud.
After considerable delay Miss Nellie
Iia.tti|ran entered the juryroom and told
what she knows of the mysterious bogus
will. Her rccitaJ contained no detail which
fcas not been published. The young wo
man eaid that she had received the
etranpe package through the mall and
without opening "the inner envelope had
turned it over to the attorneys for Mrs.
Murray. Further than this Miss Rattieran
know nothing and was excused.
J. F. Sullivan, one of Mrs. Murray's at
torneys, was the next witness, and re
lated what he had done after Miss Rat
tigan had turned the letter over to him.
He went at once to the Chief of Police,
In whose presence the letter was opened
and the will read. An outline was then
given of what transpired before Judge
Dunne when the attorneys for Mrs. Mur
ray presented the alleged testament, pro
nounced It a forg-ery and accused Mrs.
Bessie Tracy Smith of having knowledge
of the fraud. Chief of Police Sullivan fol
lowed his namesake on the witness stand
and described what he had done to solve
the mystery. He had detailed detectives
to find the mysterious witness, Mrs. M.
Bell, but they had met with no success.
Expert Kytka had been ordered to make
a thorough Inspection of the alleged will
and othrr documents, and had reported
positively that Mrs. Bessie Tracy Smith
was the author of the document.
With this testimony the Grand Jury,
much to the astonishment and chagrin o>
