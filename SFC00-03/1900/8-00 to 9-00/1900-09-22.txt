the proposition of this Government that
the Chinese leaders guilty of instigating

foreigners should be given up for punish

less positively rejected. It Is made clear
that this Government agrees with Ger
many on the principle that the guilty
should be punished, and attention is di

Hay, in the note of July 3, that "if wrong
be done to our citizens we propose to hold

BERLIN, Sept. 21. â Some of the powers have already replied to the German note regarding the punishment of the Chi
nese ringleaders implicated in the massacres â among others Russia, the United States and probably France. Germany will not
publish the answers of the powers who consent to her proposal, in order to avoid the appearance of exerting pressure on the other
powers. Perhaps publication will be made later after all the replies have been received. A conversation with German officials con
firms the belief that there is dissension between Germany and the United States.
A dispatch received here from Taku, dated to-day, September 21, says: "Yesterday evening the Peitang forts opened
fire on the Russian infantry camp, wounding twenty-five men. Since early this morning a German howitzer battery has been
shelling the forts and town." .
These are In substance the conclusion
reached by the President and Cabinet to
day in their consideration of the replies
to be sent to the several notes from the
Russian, German and Chinese govern

Wollant, Russian Charge d'Affairts, this
afternoon is most important as it given
a clear statement of this Government's
policy:
The Russian Government is in
formed that the United States Gov
ernment proposes immediately to
withdraw the greater part of the
forces under General Chaffee. Recog
nizing, however, the fact that it
would be unwise to leave Minister
Conger in China without ample pro

now out. Such action leads to trouble
of the most serious character and we
think too much of our" men to replace
them with outsiders."
This provision Is inserted because here
tofore when committees presented griev
ances to any of the great companies they
were met with the argument that the
company could not remedy the wrongs
complained of because competing com
panies enforced conditions of employment
not more favorable to the mine-workers
than their own. By holding these separate
conferences simultaneously in one city
there could be an exchange of opinion
between all of the mine-workers and
miners whose interests were at stake,
thus removing the possibility of one com
pany being placed at a disadvantage by
paying more for labor than was exacted
from their competitors.
Provided, however, that such conference
between the various companies and com
mittees representing their own employes
will meet in separate halls on the same
date.
Mr. Mitchell asserts that he la an ad
vocate of arbitration and opposed to

owners If the officers of these railroad
companies will meet committees of their
own employes and come to a peaceful
agreement.

of the mine workers or the anthracite
field having their wages based upon a
sliding scale the earnings of the Markle

were the strike to prove a failure at other
points in the anthracite region.
The independent operators, Mr. Mitchell
says, are absolutely in trie clutch of the
railroads. If the miners made a settle

could be lived up to by Markle & Co. only
so long as the strike continued elsewhere.

This was followed by a shower of stones.
Many of the crowd had picked up sticks

had previously cautioned his men to keep

the Chinese received them with a rattling rifle fire, in addition to shells from heavy guns.
"The ground was mined over which we advanced, and the explosion of mines killed al

Motives of Germany and Russia Open

LONDON, Sept. 22, 4 a. m.â It seems
to be generally believed throughout Eu

her demand that the anti-foreign leaders
should be surrendered before negotiations
were commenced, with a view of delaying
any general acceptance of her proposal
until Field Marshal von Waldersee should
arrive at Peking. A dlppatch to the Daily

the United States Government has polite

In any event, with Count von Waldersee

WEEPING WATER. Nebr.. Sept. 21.â
W. J. Bryan to-day conducted the canvass
of his old Congressional district. He
makes a practice of going over the dis
trict eyerj^ two years. To-day he left
Lincoln at 9 o'clock, and running a few
miles out to Elm wood took a carriage and
drove twenty miles across the country to
Syracuse. He spoke to quite a large as
semblage of people there, and when he
concluaed re-entered his carriage an^
made another twenty-mile drive to Weep
ing Waters.
He spoke here to-night in a large grove,
and notwithstanding it is a Republican
community he had a large and attentive
audience. The speech delivered here to
r.ight was addressed mainly to Republi
cans and was an appeal to them to con
sider the new questions presented in the
campaign, without regard to past party
afflliations or prejudice. He paid especial
attention to the increase of the army and
the Philippine question.
SYRACUSE. Nebr.. Sept. 21.â In his
speech here to-day Mr. Bryan announced
that in his speech at Nebraska Citv next
Wednesday evening he would discuss the
trust question because of the presence
there of the starch combination. He said
that the Democrats believed as much in
tariff reform as they had in 1S32, but
neither of thefre was the issue of supreme
importance now. Referring to the trusts,
Mr. Bryan said:
"Everybody except Mr. Hanna knows
that we have trusts. Mr. Hanna made a
epeeeh the other day in which he said he
iiid not believe there was a trust in the
United States. I think he is the only man
in the country who pays he docs not know
there is a trust, and my own opinion is
that there is not a man in the country
who knows more about the trusts than
he does or knows better their names and
places of doing business."

NEW YORK, Sept. 21.â Confirmation of
the brief account given by the Moscow
correspondent of the Standard of the mas

a more detailed recital of the event in a
letter from Professor G. Frederick Wright
of the Oberlin Theological Seminary.
Ohio, under the date of Strclenski. Si
beria. August 6. llr. Wright describes the
friendly relations existing between the
Russians and Chinese along the railway
line prior to the outbreak of the anti-for
eign disturbances and continues:
"But in the twinkling of an eye all this
was changed. As soon as the Russian
troops went clown the river on transports
(July 14) the fort at Aygun began with a
warning to fire upon passing steamships,
and on the 15th fire was opened upon
Blagovestchensk and soine Russian vil
lages were burned opposite the fort.
"The actual injury inflicted by the Chi
nese was slight, but the terror caused by

being forced upon rafts entirely inade

tempting to cross the river. The stream

days after we counted hundreds of them
Ir "In e our a r C ide through the water country
to reach the city on Thursday, the 19th.
we saw asmany as thirty villages and
hamlets of Chinese in flames. One of them
wa?a I city of 8U00 or 10.000 inhabitants. W e
estimated that v.e saw the dwellings or
20.000 peaceable Chinese In flames that
awful day, while parties of Cossacks were
scouring the fields to find Chinese and
shooting them down at sight. What be
came of the women and children no one
knows, but there was apparently no way
for them to escape to a place of safaty.
"On our way up the river for 500 relies
above the city every Chinese hamlet was
a charred" mass of ruins. The large vil
lage of Motcha was still smoking and we
were told that 400 Chinese had been killed.
"We do not mention these facts to ex
cite prejudice against the Russian au
thorities or against the Cossacks. This
Â¦work of devastation has not tx^en ordered
by those hish in authority. It i3 rather
the result of mob violence, such as insti
gated the promoters of lynch law in thÂ«Â»
Southern States, or. more nearly, such as
has from time immemorial animated the
pioneers in America against the Indiana
when whole^.ile destruction of property
and of life was thought to hf- a mllfary
necessity. The wives and children of thft
Cossacks were in terror.
'â¢Since we left we hear that Aygun ha^
been taken amid great losa of life to in*
Chinese. Work in the mines 13 paralyzed
and laborers have been driven out. Peacn
between the Russians and Chinese, two
of the greatest nations of the world, has
come to an end. Yeare cannot wipe ou:
the enmity engendered.
"The Chinese eastern railway extend*
for 1S00 miles through a country that
must remain hostile. The American In
dians were so few that they could be ex
terminated or absorbed. The absorbing
capacity of the Chinese Js fully equal to
that of the Russians. Yet these nations
are now brought Into contact with a ltrirÂ»
200") miles In extent. The prospect Is not
pleasing. Can the breach be healed? Can
time erase the memories of the last two
weeks? It seems impossible."

CONFIRMS RUMOR OF
CHINESE SLAUGHTER
(Drawn from photograph taken for the Dallas News.)
GREATEST MIRACLE WROUGHT BY THE TORNADO.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 1900,
NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 21.â There was
n Quadruple lyncliinj? in Ponchatoula,
Tanpipahna Parish, last r.Ipht.
The lynched men, all negroes, were:
Isaiah Rollings, aged 18, single;
IJathaniel Bowman, aged 47, leaves
Â» wife and seven children; Charles
Elliott, n^ed 20. single; George Bick
ham. aged 20.
Th. !vnol-.ings are the outgrowth of a
robbery committed on Tuesday night last.
trtien some r.Â« groes entered the home of
Mr. uv,<\ 'Av.-. !,<>U!:- Hotfeldtcr and rcMxvi
tl!Â«m of $258. As one of the negroes was
in Ih* art of rifling: the arn;"ire, Mrs. Hot
frMtrr fnranR from her bed and grappled
\\-.\h the burglar. Ik-fore -her husband
<<iu!d erne to h<r rescue the nepro dealt
her a fÂ«tuttninjÂ» blow on the head which
knocked her f*>nsolef;t=. and escaped. It is
feared i-he may lope hrr mind.
The citizens <if Ponchatouia armed
themselves and organized a posse to hunt
<li v!i ihe burglars. As the perpetrators
\Â» â¢ r" not positively known, it was deter
mined to run in all the neproes of the
r.c ighborhood. who were known to have
unsavory reputation*. As a result four
teen were arrested and landed in jail. At
JÂ« o'olook last Â«iisht the mob v.-alted on
Sheriff Mix and tiemande-d the keys of the
jail. These he refused to give up.
They then blattered down the doors of
ihe jail and taking four of the negroes,
d rapped them out and strung: them' up to
a single tree. The necks of three were
broken by the fall, but the other, George
Bickham. was strangled to death. No
shots were tired into their bodies, which
were left hanpinj; until 7 o'clock this
morning:.
The Coroner's jury returned the usual
verdict of "Camp to their death at the
hands of parties unknown."
I'o.tps of citizens are scouring . the
country for other susireots. and it is al
most certain that other lynehings will
follow. The negroes are terrorized and
are flocking to the churches as places of
safety.
Ther*Â» havf been more deeds of vlolonce
in Tangipahoa Parish than in all the other
parishes of the State combined. Up to
a recent date it wap almost a Weekly oc
currence for an assassination or a murder
to be committed. Moreover the perpetra
tor would be tried and invariably ac
quitted.
Armed Men Are Scouring the Country, and It Is Feared
That More Deeds of Violence Wiil Be Com

Mare Island Naval Orders.
VALJjEJO, Sept. 21.â The following
naval orders have been received at Mare
Island: . Promotionsâ Lieutenant Colonel
B. F. Harrington to be colonel of Marine
Corps; Major O. C. Berryman to be lieu
tenant colonel of Marine Corps. Retire
mentâMedical Director G. w. Woods.
The order sending Lieutenant O. W.

voked. Capta-in-H.. Leonard Is detached

Mare Island for treatment:.
becausa the people in advance withdrew the
riiht of criticism. When you say of your
President that he can do no wronsâ that you
will not criticize him â you have virtually In
dorsed the fundamental principle of monarch
ical government. All history has taught this
and everybody's knowledge of human nature
confirms Itâ namely, that power tends always
to grow In the hands of him who exercises it.
Give a: President power to overstep the limits
of the constitution and no one can tell how
far he may go upon the road to despotism.
How far have they gone already? t
In conclusion Mr. Towne remarked that
the dinner pall of the slave was full, and
that in the times of the Roman empire
the people were daily fed at the patri
cians' doors; but the American people
were not to be deceived by such superfi
ciality into closing their eyes while their
Government was stolen from them. The
money question was neither dead nor set
tled. We could not extend our commerce
with silver-using countries without restor
ing bimetallism.
SAN JOSE, Sept. 21.â The Democrats
opened the campaign, here to-night with a
rally at the Auditorium. A parade of
Democratic marching clubs headed by the
Fifth 'Regiment band and accompanied
by the usual red fire and roman candles
preceded the mass meeting. . There was
a large crowd at the Auditorium. Besides
prominent Democrats from all over thQ
county Chairman of the State Committee
Sims and M. F. Tarpey occupied seats on
the platform. J. H. Henry, Democratic
Congressional candidate from this district,
was chairman and made a short address
before Introducing Hon. Charles A.
Towne,' the speaker of the evening.
The meeting was an enthusiastic one.
Mr. Towne was frequently applauded. He
said America was the greatest power in
the world. Four years ago- he left the
Republican party and for four years he
had been doing what his energy and abil
ity could do to advance the cause of a
great principle rather than the selfish in
terests of any political party. The his
tory of.tbfi political parties was reviewed.
â¢In the earlier part of the century the- evil
influences of society tended to make for
the good of the few and against the many.

Jury Acquits a Redskin Accused of
the Killing of an Arizona
Officer.
FLAGSTAFF, Ariz., Sept. 21.â One of
the most Interesting cases in the history
of the Territory ended to-day when the
jury acquitted To-Hi-Be-Gay, charged
with the murder of Officer Montgomery.
The trouble arose last November when
Deputy Sheriff Dan Hogan, with. a posse
of officers, went out to arrest a certain
Navajo Indian for having drawn his Win
chester upon Montgomery, a cowboy.
They found the Indians in camp fifteen
miles from Canyon Diablo, and, after
reading the warrant to the redskins, took
their guns.
As the Indians did not understand the
warrant, there being no interpreter, they
at once attempted to recover their arms.
After a short scuffle the officers drew their
nix-Fhooters and then a life and death
stniKglt began. In a few seconds Mont
gomery had bten killed, Deputy Hogan
wounded in the back and through the
arm and William. Durham shot through
the leg. Two Indians were killed, the old
chief dangerously wounded and To-Hi-Be-
Gay shot through the left wrist.
United States District Attorney Morri
son proved that the Indian who was ar
rested had run from the place before the
shot was fired that killed Montgomery.

STOCKTON. Sept. 21.â Hon. Charles A.
Towne has come and gone without creat

Towne's address on the plaza was distin
guished by two things. He did not men

He devoted his entire time to telling Re

The distinguished gentleman arrived
here at 12:10 and was escorted to the plaza
by a select company of Democrats. Less
than 500 people gathered around the stand.
It was a bad hour and a windy . day.
Judge Joseph Budd presided. Once intro

had this to say to Republicans concern
ing the President:
We sometimes hear the motto. "My country,
right or wrong." That Is bad enough. But
when we say, "My party, right or wrong,"
it is infinitely worse, for that is the abdication
of individual Judgment. But when we go
farther, as some men in the United States to
day are doing-, and say "My President, right
or wronsr," we have abandoned the funda
mental principles of the republic. To say "My
President, right or; wrong," is vlrtuallyito an
nounce.the very fundamental doctrine of mon
archy, which, as you know, used to be ex
sressed In this way: "The Kins can do no
wrong."
Why could the King do no wrong? Not be

SMALL CROWD .
HEARS TOWNE
SALT LAKE, Utah, Sept. 21.â The
special Roosevelt train which re
mained at Ogden la^t night pulled
out for Salt Lake at 9:30 o'clock
this morning, arriving at 10:3'J.
Governor Richards of Wyoming and
United States Senator Warren of the
same State were on board the train. Sen
'ator Shoup of Idaho and Senator Carter
of Montana were still with the Roosevelt
party.
The train was met here by a great num
ber of people and a brigade of rough
riders, who escorted the Governor through
the principal streets, where flattering
demonstrations took place. Governor
Roosevelt was driven to the Alta Club
this morning and was there met by Hon.
R. C. Kerens, National Committeeman
from Missouri, and Perry S. Heath, secre
tary of the National Committee. One hun
dred and fifty cowboys wen in the street
in front of the club and the Governor was
persuaded to mount a horse and take a
gallop with the boys. As they prepared
for the start Governor Roosevelt remark
ed to the captain of the troop, "Now,
boys, when we fc tart lead off on a gallop."
This was done and the column of horse
men were soon flying down the street ana
disappeared in the dust. The ride lasted
about an hour. On his return from the
gallop he visited the famous Mormon
Tabernacle to iisten to an organ re
cital by Professor Daynes. The Governor
enjoyed this musical treat greatly and at
its close he exclaimed enthusiastically:
"This Is the best thing I have seen yet.
I have enjoyed it immensely. It is su
perb."
During the morning Governor Roosevelt
sent the first leng distance telephone
message over the line just constructed
between Salt Lake and Cheyenne, a dis
tance of 530 miles.
Governor Rootevelt and Perry S. Heath
were each presented with a genuine cow
boy saddle and bridle to-day by Utah
friends.
At the Salt Air Pavilion this afternoon
Governor Roosevelt spoke in part as fol
lows:
It must be to every man who is interested In
ta you that what has been gained by the blood
of our brethren and the children of our loins
shall not be forfeited through craven weak
ness. I ask that all good Americansâ and be
yond and above all others that you of the
West, you who embody* all that Is most glori
ous and most characteristic in American citi
zenshipâshall see to it that, at the outset of
the new century that is upon us, this nation
shall not abundon its duty, that it shall not
abandon those friendly islanders who have
trusted to our good faith and that It shall not
cringe before the task in front of us; that this
nation shall not play the part of a weakling
and a coward, but that it shall stride forward
with the strength of a giant and shall make
It evident to the nations of the world that
they may know now, once for all, that
wherever the American flag has been hoisted
in honor it shall never be pulled down in dis
honor.
Senator Carter of Montana spoke briefly.
The meeting at the Salt Lake Theater
to-night was one of large proportions.
The State. Assembly room was selected,
but it was not large enough to contain
those who sought admission. The seats
were filled, the three large galleries were
filled, the stage was filled and all the
standing room was- occupied to such an
extent that members of the National Com
mittee and even members of the recep
tion committee and of the press could not
obtain admittance. In his speech Mr.
Roosevelt said:
. The Philippines shall have libertyâ aye. they
shall have a measure of liberty of which they
have been In absolute ignorance throughout
the ages. They shall have such liberty as
they have never known under Spain's rule and
such a measure of liberty as they never could
kr.o'vr under the rule of the tyrannical and
bloodthirsty oligarchy of > their own people.
They shall have liberty, but they shall have
It under the American flag.
We can say that we stand for justice. Let
us see to It that this nation in this generation
stands for Justice -for all; for equal dealing
with the strong and the weak: let us see to
It that our International obligations are per
formed: let us see to it that the nations of
the. world understand that we will do Justice,
not through fear, but because we love justice.
Our authority extends over the Philippines
now; if we shrink back from the task that
Is before us. It will show that our forefathers
who foueht the great . civil war for the pre
servation of this Government are better and
braver than we are. If we do that we will
have shown ourselves, as a nation, to have
ended lngloriously a career began gloriously.
this country a matter of the keenest delight
to come herp and see the marvels that have
been worked by man's Industry and thrift, by
his capacity, foresight and intelligence here In
this State. Much remains to be done, and the
national Government should. In my judgment,
do Its part, for here In the West the next
great stride must be taken by means of Irri
gation. It is eminently wise and proper that
the national Government should do its part
In creating proper storage reservoirs and proper
means for distributing It, and by that means
the products of this country will be tripled and
quadrupled.
Governor Roosevelt then paid a glowing
tribute to the services of the Utah sol
diers in the Philippines and continuing
said:
Now, gentlemen, I have but a word to say
to you, you, my fellow citizens, and you. men
and women of this great State. I will touch
upon Just one of the issues of this campaign
this afternoon. What I have to say is sug
gested by what has been in the papers during
the past two days and by what I have seen
here myaelf. The other day Mr. Bryan, In his
3peech at Chicago, Is reported as having said
that it boded ill for the republic to have a
hundred thousand soldiers walking about In
idleness. This morning I took lunch as a
guest of some of your citizens, among whom
were three men who wore the uniform of the
United States army and all of whom were with
me at Santiago, the eldest of whom, a lieu
tenant colonel, walks with a cane because on
the second day of the siege, when walking
about In Idleness, a t*hrapnel struck him. and
he will walk lame for the balance of his life
In consequence.
You read in the papers this morning about
how a band of our men were attacked by ten
times their number of Filipinos yesterday, and
how a third of them were killed and wounded
before they beat off their foes. Do you think
those men were walking about In Idleness? A
third of them are lying at this moment either
dead or on hospital cots, suffering from
wcunds that they received.
Do you not think that the courage of these
men and their patient endurance of suffering
and hardship in what they have done in up
holding the flag should entitle them to a better
reward than some slander or sneer about their
walking about in idleness? That news came
this morning. . â¢
I feel that in this crisis, at this period of our
history, ve have the right to appeal to every
man In whose veins the red blood flows to stand
with us now. I have the right to appeal to
every woman who gladly sent a son, a brother
or a lover to the war. I have a right to appeal

Appointee of Utah's Acting Governor
Balked by Precedent in
Quay Case.
SALT LAKE, Utah. Sept. 21.â The fol
lowing signed statement has been given
to the press by Judge O. W. Powers, who
Â¦was recently appointed United States Sen
ator from Utah byâ Acting Governor
Nebecker:
While there can be no question that Sen
ator Xebecker was Governor in the absence of
Governor Wells and Secretary Hammond from
the State and that he had power to appoint
a United States Senator, the precedent In the
Quay case makes it clear that his appointee
would not be seated. Our Democratic State
chairman. Mr. Burton, is of the opinion that
I can be of more service to the party on the
electoral ticket than in making a contest. In
addition, I have no desire to draw the salary
pending: a contest when I am convinced in ad
vance that the seat would be refused. Hence,
to take action, I shall not accept the appoint
ment. At first, it appeared to me that I
should make the fight and thus draw attention
once more, as urged by the Democratic party,
for a constitutional amendment providing for
the election of Senators by the people; but my
sober Judgment Is to the contrary. 1 appreciate
Governor Nebecker's confidence and shall al
ways cherish the compliment.

John W. Hamilton, D. D.. who 19
now conducting the Methodist Con
ference in the First Methodist
Church in this city, is a friend of
the negro and after a long experi
ence in the educational work of the
church throughout the South gives
it as his opinion that the black man
is the equal in intelligence and pos
sibilities of his white brethren who
have had no more opportunities for
advancement than his own. Upon
being asked what the .solution, of
the race problem, according to his
judgment, will be, the Bishop
straightened himself up to his full
height, knitted hl3 brows thought

plied:
"There were 30,000 mulattoes born
In the United States in the past
year and fully one-sixth of the
colored race to-day has white blood
in its veins. From that you can
draw your own conclusions and I

these facts there la little question
as to the ultimate solution of the

SAN JOSE. Sept. 21.â This city is to
have an up-to-date summer resort, anl
the mineral waters of the springs of Alum
Rock Park are to be advertised to the
world. This is made possible by an opin
ion rendered to-day by Judge Rhodes of
the Superior Court, atter a bitter contest
in which the various churches were ar
rayed against the City Council.
A few months ago Dr. S. f. Terry of
Inulana asked the Council for a lease ot
a nortlbn of. Alum Rocit ParK for the pur
pose of erecting a hotel there and estab
lishing a summer resort. The members cf
the churches objected to a lease being
granted, on the ground that liquor might
be sold there. They engaged Attorney
Henry French and Judge Slack of San
Francisco and enjoined the Council from
granting the lease. It was claimed the
park was dedicated to public use. and
therefore the city had no right to grant
special privileges. Judge Rhodes to-day
dissolved this injunction. The provision
in the city charter providing for the lease
of the park was sustained on the ground
that the Legislature had dedica'*- 1 Â»ht"
power to the city and that the rights of
George Harter, the petitioner, were not
being Infringed upon. Kx-City Attorney
W. A. Beasly and F. 11. Benson repre
sented the city.
As soon as the decision was rendered
the City Council was called together in
special session and a lease granted to Dr.
Terry, who gave a bond of $1000 to carry
out its provisions. This prompt action by
the city was necessary to prevent the op
position taking further action.
By the terms of the lease Dr. Terry Is
granted the use of one end a half acres
of the park for a term of twenty-live
years. He is to erect a Â£5,000 hotel, to be
under the restrictions of the Council.
The building of the hotel Is of great
Importance to this city, as the park has
many valuable mineral spring? and Is
destined to become a great summer resort.
Grant of a Lease Was Objected To by
Beligious Bodies, Which Op

PLACERVILLE, Sept. 21.-0.Tie Superior
Court room was densely cror.ded during
to-day's proceedings in the trial of Isaiah
Zumwalt Tor the murder of his son. Cor
cuer Winchell, Dr. N. W. Mountain and
Dr. M. McLean all testified to haling vis
ited the scene of the tragedy at about 9
o'clock on the night of its occurrence,
and there seeing the body of George
Zumwalt in a sitting posture in a chair in
the sitting-room of his house, with a bul
iet wound through the nghi arm and
body. The body ol Julia Zurnw:ilt was in
the yard back of the house witn the top
cf the head blown on, and the body of the
infant child of George and Rose Zumwalt
was viewed at the house of Neighbor Sel
lick, where the mother of the child lay
suffering from a rifle wound through both
aims.
The greatest interest centered in the
testimony of Agnes Zumwalt. the 14-year
old daughter of the defendant. She left
home with her mother on the morning of
the tragedy and drove to the house of
George Zumwait, and thence, in company
with George's wife and child, to Placer
ville. They returned to George Zumwalt's
plate at about tÂ» o'clock and went Into
the sitting-room, where they engaged in
conversation with George for nearly an
hour. The defendant in the meantime
paced the porch with his hand over his
heart and complained to -the boy who
delivered the milk that he suffered great
pain. Presently he entered his bedroom
and reappeared with a rifle. The women
all ran out of the house and as the wit
ness fl.'d toward a neighboring ranch she
heard three shots but saw nothing. The
witness admitted that George, just before
the shooting, said regarding his father:
"He is too big a coward to do anything.
There is no danger."
She denied that any conversation con
cerning thÂ«j elder Zumwalt had elicited the
remark from her mother that "the old
fool has another . one of his tantrums;
look at his eyes."
John P. Selllck, living about 200 yards
south of the Zumwalt place, testified' that
the defendant was at his house about 3
o'clock on the afternoon of the tragedy,
and said:
"Some of these days I will do a whole
lot of shooting, and 1 advise you not to
interfere In my troubles."
After the shooting the old man again
came to the witness and said:
"Somebody had better go and take care
of those folks. There is one in the house
and one iri the yard."

Thomas J. Winship on Trial for the
SAN JOSE, Sept. 21.â The trial of
Thomas J. Winship for the murder of
Frank CCarvaez began in Judge Lorlgan's
court to-day. A plea of self-defense !s
being set up. The murder occurred in the
Universal restaurant on May 3.
Tony Obllzalo was the first witness
called and hit- direct testimony and cross
examination by Attorney Herrington. for
the defendant, occupied the entire fore
noon. His evidence was practically the
fame as that given at the preliminary ex
amination. He was night clerk in the
restaurant at the time Frank Narvaez
was killed by Winship and his account of
the affair did not. in the minds of his
hearers, help Winship's plea that the klll
ir.g was in self-defense.
Oblizalo told how he had ordered the
men to keep quiet or leave the place.
Soon afterward he heard Winship call
Narva ez a vile name and the latter said
"You're a liar," making a movement to
rise. The men were at adjoining tables
and Winship at once arose and drew his
revolver, shootinp Xarvaez in the neck.
Xarvaez, the witness testified, was quite
drunk at the time and unsteady on his
feet. Winship placed his revolver against
A'arvaezs neck and twice the latter
shoved his arm aside. The third time
Narvaez stood practically helpless, while
Winship held him by one arm and fired.

Women are vastly more patient than
men. It is scarcely believable that a
woman, suffering past all telling, can
attend to business, and bend and stoop
with a back whose ache is agony. And
beyond all this she smiles as she bends
and stoops about her customer. A man
might swallow down an oath or keep
back a groan, but his face would be like
a thundercloud, and his voice scarcely
disguise his irritition.
For -women who suffer from backache,

Nothing has come of the protest of the
South End intermediate barge crew
against the awarding of the race to the
Alamedas. The judges at the stakes re
ported that the South Ends did not round
the mark, and on that report the referee
gave his decision. Even according to the
statement of the South End men them
selves the barge rounded the buoy with
her bow only, but not with her full length,
as she should have done. A boat must
pass entirely around the mark on its far
ther Hide, though to foul it is no ground
for disqualification.
The protest that wa? suggested against
the new Alameda skiff has also fallen
flat. The boat, though much lighter than
the ordinary skiff, is only four pounds
lighter than a skifT owned by the Dol
phins, and was built in conformity to the
definitl-n laid down by the regatta com
mittee.

TANFORAN PARK will Inaugurate
on Monday the first annual fair of
the San Francisco and San Mateo
Agricultural Association. It will
be the first big event of this nature
that the people of this city have had in
many years, and as it comprises a horse
show, bench show, athletic games, pony
and harness racing, polo games, exhibi
tions of livestock, long-distance riding and
numerous other attractions, this inaug
ural fair should be a success.
The entries to the horse show are quite
large and comprise a number of the best
horses of every class in and around San
Francisco. The Judging of these will take
place during the first week of the fair,
and as the track proper and infield at
Tanforan are very suitable for such ex
hibitions this feature will be most inter
esting.
On the opening day three harness races
will be decided. These are given over to
the members of the Golden Gate Park
Driving Association and will be the best
two in three heats for $300 purees. The
entries are large enough to assure good
sport. ,
The committee on trotting exhibits -will
be composed of J. F. Boyd, J. C. Klrk
patrick and Major J. L. Rathbone. The
members of thfe horse show exhibits are
John Parrott, J. D. Grant and Edwin F.

the best rabbitrles in the three counties.
The kennel department of the fair,
after considerable hard work on the part
of Superintendent Laldlaw, will have
about 150 dogs of every variety on the
benches. There arc a number of prize
winners among the lot and fanciers will
have an opportunity ot seeing some new
breeds which have been brought to this

by the gentlemen riders of the different
clubs around San Francisco. There will
be six races each day and this will in

On Tuesday, the 25th, the State polo
tournament will begin, and considerable
Interest is being taken in this event by
the crack players of the clubs around the
State. The game will be continued on
Thursday, when there will also be several
exhibitions of vaquero riding of untamed
horses. Some competent men are engaged
to do this specialty, which will be one or
the novelties of the show.
The twenty-five mile running race on
Friday will be another new thing in the
way of specialties not seen In California
in twenty years. Several women will
participate in this event. .
The narnesa racing during the second

BRILLIANT CLOSE OF
CRICKET YEAR AT HAND
Young America Will Strive to Beat the Sons of Old England
at the British Game.
IN about a month the cricket season of
1900 will have ended, The- winner of
the association pennant will undoubt
edly be the Alameda Cricket Club,
with the Pacifies second and Califor
nias third. Four more matches remain on
the schedule, but it is likely that those in
which Â¦ tho California Club is one of tho
contestants will not be played. The sea
son has been a very successful one. The
three clubs of city players have had an
interesting series of matches on the Ala
mefla grounds, and a delightful trip to
Lake County was recently enjoyed by an
eleven made up from the three teams.
The hospitality of the lovers of the Brit
ish game in Lake County is unbounded,
and on this occasion they surpassed them
selves. Of the three matches played dur
ing the trip the city visitors won two
losing the game against Bums Valley. In
addition to the clubs round San Francisco
and in Lake County there are also clubs
at Sacramento and Grass Valley and in
Placer County. The game, too, is played
not <Â«il.v by men <>f British or> colonial
birth but also by many young Americans.
The Lake County eleven is, in fact, made
up almost exclusively of native Ameri
cans, and young Rose, until he met with
a severe accident in a Lakeport sawmill,
was one of the hest bowlers in the State
?,, J-Â« llf orniai < The Banta Cruz/Country
Club has a cricket annex and two or three
very pleasant visits to the seaside town
have be^n enjoyed by the San Francisco
cricketers. It is not unlikely that a team
Of; Santa .Cruz players will come up to
this city before the season closes and will
try conclusions with the San Francisco
men on their own grounds.
Though the match <if the California
Cricket Club vs. tho Pacific Cricket Club,
scheduled for to-morrow, will not be
played, the day will- not be a blank one
for the local cricketers. Arrangements
have been made, for the match which waa
talked of some weeks ago between the
cricketers who learned the game in Great
Britain or her colonies and those young
Americans who have learned it In this
country. The match will be named YOHng
America vs. Old Kngland and should fur
nish a olosp contest. The representatives
of tho mother country will be the follow
ing: R. B. Hogue. H. C. Casidy, C. P.
Coles. J. Myers, A. W. Wilding. D. Jamie
son. H. Ward Jr.. J. H. Saunders. K. G.
Sloman. A; JD. Reynolds and J. Guild. The
Young America team will be made up of
the following: P. Croll (captain), V. See
beck: W. G. Fortmann. F. Stahl. H. Bird.
B. Bird. W. Rlchter. A. Willis, L. Schroe
der. G. Schroeder. J. Brown and B. Theo
bald. Both teams have considerable
strength in bowling and fielding, though
the batting is stronger among the repre
sentatives of Old England, including as it
does R. B. Hogue, J. Myers, C. P. Coles,
E. G. Sloman and A. D. Reynolds.
THE preparatory stage of the football season has begun and all three
teams- Keliance, California and Stanfordâ are earnestly working- to de
velop victorious" teams. The season will formally open next Saturday at
Palo Alto, when the Rellanco team fares the cardinal.
SepL Etâ The first week's work on the gridiron Is re
dfiedly eneourairing for the California football men. A weeding out process has
V>een gtfng on with the result that two largo squads have been formed â one con
taining all the older raon with a sprinkling of the more promising freshmen
rrunlMate?, the second comprised of freshmen who have yet to make their mark.
The first eq.uad is divided among some of the older players, who are acting as
*!=Mstant? to Coach Kelly in carefully drilling the various candidates in the fine
point? nnd tricks of their positions. The work of the second sauad is undar
Frank Ellis and Is simpler end more elemental than that of the varsity.
The freshman candidates are attracting unusual attention. Perhaps never
lwfore In one entering class has there been so many big men. The prospects are
bright, cvrn at this early date, for a very strong "baby" team. Though the
weeding out process has only begun, some substantial material has been picked
already for the varsity squad. Stowe of Bclmont and Savage of Los Angeles ans
a pair of heavy tackles, capable of making a strong bid for varsity places. Duff,
a heavy-weight from Boone's. is active enough to warrant his making a very
good enter. Overall is being deflnitely"lrained for a position as guard, wherj he
is sorely reeded. Promising backs, especially punters of marked ability, are
uncommonly plentiful. No ends have teen passed upon yet, though there a<o
more candidates for this position than for any other.
PALO ALTO. Sept. 21.â The football men have settled well into their work
and are already in shape for hard practice. Especially is this true of the fresh
man candidates, who lined up Wednesday for ten minutes of brisk line smashing
and end running. The youngsters went Into the scrimmages with a dash and de
termination that promise future victories.
Coach Tost is well pleased with the material at band, which, though light,
wfll l'kely offset its lack of weight by speed. Another point in favor of this
year's aggregation is that It contains a larger percentage of experienced men.
Some of the candidates for backs are Grant Taylor and Clark of Holtt's, Wig
jrins of Syracuse, X. T.. De Witt of Tulare. Beebe of Porterville and several
others whos* records are unknown.
The varsity men are put through a brisk signal practice every evening, but
will do no heavy work till next week. Cooper and Caglieri -ire being tried at the
end positions. Raitt at Quarter, Seeley at right guard and Slaker at fullback.
Otherwise :a*t year's team Is intact. Hill, fullback on the '93 team, and Geiasler.
a prominent candidate for half, have returned to college and will try for half
biu-k positions. As both are strong punters their prospects are good. Slaker's
work smong the backs is eliciting the admiration of the grand stand experts.

THE champions and San Franclsccs have drawn half a game closer since
last week, and though It appears from the- percentage table that the
Sacr&raentos have a lead of ono jame, there Is a possibility of their be

GALVESTON DAY
AT GRAVESEND
The Weather Bureau eavs that yester
day was thÂ» hottest day of this year. On
.V.irust 1 the thermometer registered 82.
T.hich was tht nearest approach to the
present *pÂ«>!l. On the ?th of October last
year Old Sol raised the limit to 94 and it
rai e*> hot that the players in the worldly
r?me were willing to pass in their chips.
There is some comfort in the thought
that the feverish climatic condition will
pive way to thÂ«> coollnjr breezes that are
n?ual in this city. It may be cooler to
day.
.And vet ft w?js on'y 85.. Despite the
Tv!sencres who had private barometers
vrA theories the fiamrps given out by the
Weather Bureau must be taken as cor
rect. According to the men who study
the weather In all its varying changes the
hot wave Is due to "an area of high pres
sure over Oregrm and 'Washington and a
comparatively low pressure in Arizona."
According to the weather prophet it is
nothing but a California "norther." and
If any one tries to impress on your mind
that the hot spell Is due to the warm
â¢winds that ar<Â» blowing from the direc
tion of the Orient, which only foretell
nf the hot times In that territory, tell him
he ig laboring upder a delusion, or. bet
ter ptlll, tell him to come out of his
trp.nce.
The sterner sex lacked the necessary
covrp.^e to come out of doors with their
highly colored and many frilled shirts or
"?h!rt waists." as they are termed. They
were extremely warm In the upper part
of their body. but suffered from cold lower
extremities. These weie the only cool fea
tures of the day. Had Samuel'M. Short
rUfre been in town it is probable he would
have Instilled courage in coming out In
his pauzy shirt. A leader was needed
yppterday. hut nowhere could he be found.
Mayor Phelan wanted to wear gome of the
liEbt and airy creations he brought with
him from Paris: Stephen Costello had a
poUcadot affair that was lost to admiring
eyes beneath a high-cut waistcoat; Gar
ret McEnerney might have worn his. but
unfortunately the only one he possessed
was being graced with new armshlelds:
J. C. Kirkpatrick saw the opportunity of
Â¦cvesring his fancy shirr waist go by with
t'.irhs of regret: Joe Tobln was afraid of
inking cold with h!s low-cut vest, and
Kd Grernway longin<ly gazed out of his
flub window for ths brave man who
would establish a precedent In the wear
ip;r of this comfortable summer garment.
The shirt -wal?t man did not put in his
appearance, although the fair Bex await
ed his coining on the line with the usual
femir.ir.e curiosity. He could be found
indoors, coatless and collarless, and his
decolpttc costume was neither admired
nor approved. But what care they? They
were locking for comfort and they were
po'.rg to have it even though they sacri
fjrod their personal appearance.

The baths, both private and public, were
crowded throughout the day. Men and
women lolled In the cooling depths, get

Funny Fide of the street was avoided as
If It had been stricken with disease. The
men would not cross the street unless
for the purpose of getting on the other
Fide and also for a cooling beverage. The
ocean beach was lined with people who
broiled In the hot sun that beat down on
the beach for the privilege of inhaling the
ccfan zephyrs â¢which Idly floated over
their heads. Streetcars were crowded with
fatigued and perspiring people who found
TvaJking too enervating.
Ths fair sex could not restrain their
passion for bargains and left their homes
in search of marked-down articles, at
tired In costumes that were as comfort
able as they were refreshing to look upon.
Soda water fountains thrived and ice
cream melted away beneath the feverish
onslaught of the great army of pretty
frirls as enow does before the hot rays
of the Run.
It was hot yesterday. If you don't be
lieve it consult your neighbor or your own
feelings. Some men were hot under the
cellar but did not wreak their spleen by
the use of their fists or by stormy ac
claim. They sought the cooling shade of
an awning and the long glass that
cheered. They toasted and roasted the
heat in brimming beakers of "nut brown

The Native Sons and Daughters of California have
<ione macb for the State through their organization,
but much mere remains to be done. One work ac

arise an isÂ«ue bearing more directly upon the vital
point* of the welfare of the State than that of provid
ing for a thorough and scientific system of preserving
our forests and conserving our water supply. A< a
part cf that work it would be well worth while to be

cordingly it is to be hoped the Sempcrvirens Club

PERSONAL MENTION.
QUITE naturally, under the circumstances, the
reports from South Africa in these days are
full of conflict and confusion. Dispatches
from Spitzkop, dated September 19. were to the effect
that General Vilioen, who has succeeded Botha in
supreme command, was moving northward with 3000
men and thirty guns, and had announced a determina
tion to continue the war indefinitely. Another dis
patch of the same date from Nelspruit stated that of
the 3000 Boers who retreated from Komatipoort be
fore the British advance 700 entered Portuguese ter
ritory, others deserted in various directions, while the
remainder crossed the Komati River and occupied the
spurs of the Lombolo Mountains.
Roberts, of course, is eager to get the scattered
bands of the patriots rounded up and captured, and
to that end has resorted to every resource at his com
mand, from hard pursuit to pleasant promises of
leniency. In a recent proclamation announcing; to
the Boers the flight of Kruger Roberts said: "Kru
ger's action shows how hopeless, in his opinion, is
the war, which has now been carried on for nearly
a year, and his desertion of the Boer cause should
make clear to his fellow burghers that it is useless to
continue the struggle any longer. It is probably un
known to the inhabitants of the Transvaal and Orange
River Colony that nearly 15,000 of their fellow sub
jects are now prisoners of war. not one of whom will
be released until those now under arms against us
surrender unconditionally."
After pointing out that intelligent burghers can no
longer have any hope of success by their own arms,
nor assistance from any foreign power, Roberts went
on to declare that the war has degenerated into a
guerrilla struggle. He closed by saying: '"The means
I am compelled to adopt are those which the customs
of war prescribe as applicable in such cases. They arc
ruinous to the country, entail endless suffering to the
burghers and their families, and the longer this guer
rilla warfare continues the more vigorously must they
be enforced."
It is doubtless very exasperating to his Lordship
that after all that the Boers continue fighting and Vil
joen refuses to even discuss a proposition to surren
der. The war may not have staggered humanity, but
i U has made the British portion of it very tired, and
as yet there is no rest in sight.
ROBERTS AND THE BOERS.
rl A\'li you registered yet? That question should
I be part of the salutations of the day wherever
men meet. It is to the interest of the whole
community that all good citizens should register. We
may be sure that the bosses have seen to it that even*
member of their following is enrolled, so> that those
who are not yet registered are likely to be of that class
of voters upon whom the community relies for gooi
government.
It iÂ« to be borne in mind that all registrations prior
to January 1. 1900. have been canceled, and no man
:> er.titled to a vote at the coming election unless hs
has repi?tcred since that time. There ought to be no
rr.-r.nderstandir.g of the matter, for the la\v has been
published time and again, but it seems there are a
considerable number of persons who are as yet ignor
ant of the reces<=ity of registering this year even if
they have been registered in former years. So to the
inquiry, have you registered? there must be added the
further question, have you registered since January 1?
During the pa c t four year* the population of the city
h: s increased, and of course the number of persons
<"r>ied to the privilege of voting has increased with
the population. Nevertheless the registration is
many thousands of votes short of the number enrolled
i:; i8q6. Such a showing is not creditable to the coin
inunity. It iÂ» evident we have an undue proportion
of cit!7ens who are either ignorant of the election
fcws or arc indifferent to the highest privileges of an
American citizen â that of electing the men who are to
be charged with the duty of directing the affairs ot
the Government.

THE QUESTION OF THE DAY.
Senator Hill nf 1S9<5 Is. with the possible
exception of Mr- Bryan, to-day the lore
most Democrat In the land. He is a
worthy and capable loader of his party,
but he is not my leader.
Does any onÂ© believe that Mr. Croker.
without whom thers is no hope of Demo
cratic success, is any less an opponent of
bimetallism to-day than he was in 1S36?
Does any one believe that the Democratic
party if successful would pass a free
colnaKe bill? It matters not how true
their candidate for the Presidency may
be in his advocacy of this cause, without
his party behind him ar.d in sympathy
with his position on this question he will
be almost as powerless in Washington as
he is at home upon his Nebraska farm.
These are the conditions as 1 see them.
I do not believe there is any hope at pres
ent for a proper settlement of the finan
cial question.
I have always adhere! to the party's
declaration that we were Republicans on
all other questions but the financial one.
I am not a Democrat, and it seems to ma
that the time has come when w<Â» must tws
either Democrats cr Republicans. There
is to-day, in my Judgment, no middle
ground. Very truly yours.

Hon. A. M. Stevenson has been Senator Teller's right hand â¢* n J*
Colorado politics for many years. He walked out of the St. Louis Re
publican convention arm-in-arm with that Senator after that scene in
which the delegates from Colorado withdrew from the convention and
from the Republican party in obedience to the instructions from their
State convention. In the campaign which followed Mr. Stevenson, al
ways an acknowledged political leader, was most active in all that
seemed to further the interests of the free silver faction- He is a leading
lawyer in Denver and an orator of marked ability. His executive pow
ers have also put him first and foremost in every campaign in the State.
But now the Teller Silver Republican party must get along without
him, for Mr. Stevenson recently announced his return to the Republican
party, and gave as his reason that free silver was no longer an issue
before the people, and that when he withdrew from the St. I/ouia con
vention he did not surrender, as a Republican, his convictions on other
great questions.

SILVER REPUBLICAN LEADER
OF COLORADO LEAVES PARTY
Hon. A. M. Stevenson, a Denver Law
yer, Returns to the Republicans.
i \A R. HEARST was very early in the field *s an j .
/ \ expansionist, a jingo and.annexer, and was j 1
not saying anything about consent of the gov- j
erned. cither. In the Examiner on May 7, 1808, he
said: "The atrocities of Spanish rule in Cuba have "
lor generations been a disgrace to civilization. This
country forebore from interference until forbearance .
had long ceased to be a virtue. We have announced (
that we are fighting, not for profit, but for humanity.
We are thoroughly capable of handling that affair
without any outside interference, and we propose to j
handie it in that way. Should Continental Europe j '
attempt interference it would precipitate an alliance
between this country and England, with Japan as a
ltossible third. Such an alliance would dictate to the ,
world. The Anglo-Saxon-Celtic race, both in Eng
land and the United States, has proved that it pro
duces fighters. The combined resources of the two
countries are sufficient to overcome any possible .
opposing combination. Such an alliance would mean
an enforcement oi the Monroe doctrine in a far .
stricter sense thnn it has heretofore been enforced. J
But it would mean more than that. It would mean
that the United States would assert itself in the set- ,
tiement of the Eastern question. This country is not
looking for entanglements, but it is not avoiding
trouble when it come?."
Having fixed up an alliance with England and
daubed warpaint on the Angio-Saxon-Celtic race. Mr.
Hearst in the Examiner of May 16. 1S9S, proceeded to
take the Philippines, as follows: "What shall we do j
I with the Philippines? It is true we have not got
them yet, and it may be a premature counting of
chickens to assign their disposal at this stage of the
proceedings. At the same time it may be assumed
that if we undertake to hold them it will be done
effectually, for this is not a people to brook half
measures. The work which we put our hands to will
be done thoroughly, at whatever co?t. It may in
volve the very serious work of convincing the native?
that we do not do business on the same lines as Spain,
and they must behave themselves, keep the peace and
mind their business. The islands are valuable â so j
\ah:able that almost any European power would j
gladly undertake the task of reducing them were a J
reasonable excuse offered. They are practically forced J
on our hands .by the logic of remorseless circum
stances. We cannot conveniently rid ourselves of j
: them, if we would. It is certain that the half-civilized i
natives are wholly unfit for self-government. Their |
future is in the hands of America."
As has, been seen by quotations we have already j
made from him, Hearst put in the whole spring,
summer and fall of 1S98 shouting for expansion and
yelling "Nail the flag to the Philippines!" He ut
tered not one word about natural rights of the na
tives, nor government by consent, but time and again
declared that we could govern them "unhampered by
the constitution," and that it would be right to re- j
duce them with an army and make them pay the cost I
of the reduction and of keeping garrisons to keep j
them reduced. After the State elections of 1898 hj j
said ho'ding the Philippines was a Democratic policy 1
and that Democrats were tired of having to vote the j
Republican ticket to enforce a Democratic policy.
He accused President McKinley of being a little J

"Mr. Bryan has announced his attitude. We hope
it will be modified.
"As a capable leader Mr. Bryan has won admira
tion among Democrats. He was supported by this
paper when the majority of men with ten cents in !
their pockets were >-ushing up and down the streets j
screaming that silver meant the death of America.
The Examiner <iid not think that America would be j
so easily killed, and it backed up a man and a party i
headed in the direction of useful reform, unmindful J
of the timid Americans and their shrieking.
"Now comes Mr. Bryan, in his turn, and declares
his belief that America is in danger â in greater dan
ger, he says, than Cuba, and that because we shall
undertake to rule a of islands some thousands
of miles away! Mr. Bryan is disappointing in this.
He believes that we can change the financial systeni
of the world and overthrow the fixed rules of com
merce without the consent of any other nation. Does
he doubt that we can police a parcel of islands without
the consent of any other nation?
"Why so brave about silver and so timid .about
national force and far-reaching power? And it is not
so far-reaching, really. Mr. Bryan quotes Jefferson j
and reminds us that he extended the American empire |
only on this continent. Yes. but he reached out
toward the setting Â«un before the invention of loco
motive or. tHegraph. The lands he annexed were
much farther away from him than are the Philippines
j from McKinley. And yet he did not fear, as Mr. '
Bryan seems to fear, the irritation of foreign coun
tries. He wrote to Napoleon that he (Napoleon)
would do well to get out of America and not ge? too
I close to us. for we should consider it as distinctly
I unfriendly in any nation that attempted to lord it
"Jefferson talked that way to the mighty French
Emperor: America was a little nation of four mil
lions and limited resources.
"Need Mr. Bryan, or Mr. McKinley. or any Ameri
| can. hesitate to assert our rights through fear of irri
tatinc foreigners to-day? We are eighty millions,
and so rich that long generations of public thieves
cannot begin to steal money as fast as we can make
"America has not gene hunting for weak lands or
j weak peoples to conquer. She has beaten Spain â as |
j meritorious an act as killing a rattlesnake. She fought
the Spaniards to help the oppressed. Her intention
I i? to pive genuine reform to the islanders whom fate
j has thrown into her hands. It is all very well to talk
j about consent of the governed. That is in the Decla
j ration of Independence, and we should be guided by
; ft. But we may also remember, incidentally, that we
! fought our own brothers in the South for four years
and murdered thousands of them to prove that the
j governed must be good and not weaken our nation
! by setting up governments of their own. It was held
by the North that a nation that gets its freedom by
fighting as a unit muÂ«.t stay a The Filipinos gr>t
j their freedom by our fighting, and they have no good
j reason for leaving us now, unless we are willing, and
t that is fact.
"Does Mr. Bryan doubt that what men want is
I liberty? Does he think that the American system ex
! tended to the Philippines would not give them liberty?

EDITORIAL
UTTERANCE
Two Democratic State conventions in California
have put Mr. 'Hearst into the party platform and he is
the president of the National Association of Bryan
Clubs. Just what does Bryan Democracy think of
itself under the circumstances?
"Mr. Bryan says that we might take a coaling sta
tion in Porto Rico and another in the Philippines.
'Take' does not sound well. And why 'take' any
thing, if not all? Either we have a right to annex
those islands for their own good and advancement
of liberty, or we have no such right. If we have not
the right, to take any part is stealing, and we might
as well steal all as a part. The opposition to expan
sion is based on the failure to see things as they are.
This earth is no longer a huge, mysterious, limitless
thing. It is a small ball of dirt, and a man can get
around it in short order. With steam and electricity
one man of Napoleon's brain and remorseless energy
could control it all. It must sooner or later come all
under republican rule, and we might as well hurry up
the process whenever we get a chance. To spread
out in the East and set up the spectacle of freedom
and national growth under the nose of China and the
petrified East is a step in the right direction. The
Democratic party wants men who can reali7e thnt
annexation and expansion"are here; that they cannot
be stopped. The party wants men who can take a
share in problems that arise, who can suggest, and
when the time comes control. It does not want men
who sit by and protest!"
"But with the true flag over the Philippines, does
it not seem to Mr. Bryan and to all other Americans
that foreigners will be apt to keep their hands off?
"Is it not generally admitted that foreigners will
keep their hands off whatever bears our brand?
"The man of sense takes things as they are and
works accordingly. The Philippines cannot be given
away. We shall always be responsible for them. If
we turn them loose on their own hook we shall al
ways be responsible for them. We shall have to fight
their quarrels and defend them against oppression.
That will surely get us into trouble. With a weak
flag floating over the islands, with factions quarreling
for control and inviting foreign interference, will
come attempts that we will have to resist, and inev
itable conflicts will follow.
"But since the objectors dig up the Declaration of
Independence so glibly against expansion, they might
also dig it up in favor of the movement. That
declaration seems to make quite clear the American
idea that men are born free and equal. Not men in
Connecticut or New Jersey, but men â all men.
"Much is said about the quality of the Philippine
islanders. They are not good enough to suit some of
us. Too bad.

Jacob Nutherland, the colored bootblack
on Fillmore street, near Turk, was con
victed by Judge Cabaniss yesterday on
the charge of battery upon Miss Ida Rese
now, 1259 O'Farrell street, September 4,
and he was ordered to appear for sentence
this morning. Nutherland called a num
ber of witnesses to prove an alibi, but they
contradicted him as to the time he went
for his lunch. He said he always went to
his lunch exactly at noon, hut the wit
nesses testilied that it was alwavs be
tween 11:30 and noon. None of them re
membered anything about the particular
day of the assault.
Miss Resenow, a quiet, ladylike pirl,
testified that about noon of September 4
she was walking along O'Farrell street
with her umbrella up, as it was raining,
when the defendant came behind her and
threw his arms around her waist. She
struggled till she got free and hit him on
the head with her umbrella. He tried
again to throw his arms round her, but
Bhe beat him off with her umbrella, and
when a team came along he ran down an
alley. She positively identified the de
fendant.

In the same manner by a colored man at

Crowd-
Get Tickets Early and Avoid the
There is every probability that thou
sands of people will be of one mind on
September 30â that is, to go to Santa Cruz
on the grand $2 excursion which the
Southern Pacific will give on that day;
so the kindly suggestion is offered that
all who conveniently can will get their
tickets during the week at the company's
city ticket office, Market street, under the
Grand Hotel.
While a large crowd is comfortably
handled to and fro by the company's am
ple equipment, it is never pleasant to be
jostled about by a large number who are
all trying to purchase tickets at the same
time. So go early and avoid the rush.
It is understood that Santa Cruz will
make an unusual effort on this occasion
to entertain her visitorsâ at which, by the
way, she is proficient in a high degree,
and something quite out of the ordinary
mry be expected In the way of pleasure.
William H. Menton will be the com
pany's hospitable host, the knowledge of
which is always reassuring. The colonel
enjoys the proud distinction of having
managed excursions aggregating hun
dreds of thousands without having had a
single sprlous accident. So go and enjoy
yourselves.

Rev. Mr.
Rev. T. M. Harvey and Rev. J. Willlan:
Brockhage, who have been teaching at
St. Patrick's Seminary. Menlo Park, vrhtle

friends of the young men.
Rev. Mr. Brockhage was botn and
raised in Oakland. His parents are ola
residents of that city. He was educated
in the public and parochial schools ot
Oakland and was one of the first pupilri
of the parish school attached to St. Fran

brate his rirst solemn high mass to-mor
row at 10:30 a. m.
The candidate for priestly honors began
his classical education at St. Charles Col
lege, Ellicott City, Md., and finished his
studies in St. Ignatius College, this city.
He entered the new seminary at Menlo
Park when it opened in 1SS8. He h?a
taught there while pursuing his theolog
ical studies and will continue to dÂ« so
after ordination.
Rev. Mr. Harvey was born In Bostor.
and has been a long resident of New
York. He was educated for the priest
hood at St. Charles College, Ellicott City.
Md.. and at St. Mary's Seminary, Balti

He left the latter institution inyiS95
through illness and taught in New

gaged him to teach at the new seminary
at Menlo Park. He was one of the first
teachers at that institution and like his
friend will not sever his connection with
the college after ordination. He also com
pleted his studies while teacnlng.
The ceremonies at the cathedral will be
of the most solemn character. Archbishop
Riordan will be assisted at the altar by

"Founder's day," the anniversary of the
day upon which James Lick executed the
deed of trust providing for the endowment
of the California School of Mechanical
Arts, was duly observed at the Lick
School both yesterday morning and after
noon. Since the opening of the school In
1895 it has been the custom to observe this
day In an appropriate manner, not, how
ever, as is usually customary in such
casesâ by making it a day of vacation â but
on the contrary making it a day of work;
and study, thereby affording all inter
ested in the school an opportunity to see
the institution in working order.
The morning hours were given over en
tirely to pupils, teachers and directors
of the school. The afternoon belonged to
the public, and several hundred visitors
took advantage of the general Invitation
extended to visit the Institution.
At 11:30 yesterday morning the shrill
blast of the whistle sounded the signal
which called all to leave work and pro
ceed to the freehand drawing rooms to
meet the board of directors. Horaoe
Davis, president of the board, and Charles
A. Murdock were the speakers of the
morning. In a neat little five-minute ad
dress President Davis complimented both
teachers and pupils and took occasion to
refer to the school as the great "living
monument to the memory of James
Lick." Charles A. Murdock spoke of the
advantages of practical education and
presented each student with a neat little
leaflet filled with gems of thought bear
ing on the subject of success and how to
achieve it.
In the afternoon a commute* of stu
dents took charge of the many visitors
and escorting them through the school
building explained the working of the
various departments. The following
young ladies and gentlemen graciously
fulfilled the duties of a reception commit
tee:
Miss Du Bols '(chairman). Miss Camp
bell. Miss llucks. Miss Bellman. Miss
Woodsum, and Masters Burieau. Jones,
Drummond, Gamble, Alexander, Gladwin,
Monaco and Short.
The board of trustees of the school la
as follows: E. B. Pond. Charles A. Mur
dock. Frank J. Symmes. Horace Davis,
president, and James Spiers, vice presi
dent.

Sudden Passing of the Head of the
SAX BERNARDINO, Sept. 21.âTele
grams received from N>w York announce
the sudden oeath there of Lewis Jacobs
of this city, president of the Bank of San
Bernardino and one of San Bernardino's
oldest citizens. Mr. Jacobs and daughter.
Miss Lena Jacobs, went to Europe last
fcpring for a visit to the Paris Exposition
and a general tour of Europe, and both
enjoyed the best of health on the entire
trip. On their arrival this morning at
>.ew -York Miss Jacobs telegraphed that
her father was taken suddenly ill. This
dispatch was followed by a later one an
nounclng his death. The body will be
brought here for burial.
1 *^ Jacobs was born in Prussia in
3831. He emigrated to America when 20
years of age and came to San Bernar
dino In lSo2, when this was a part of LosÂ«
Angeles County. The young man started
out with a pack on his back to make a
living and succeeded so well that he soon
started a general store in this city, then
a mere settlement. In 1ST5 he sold the
Ftore and started the first bank in San
Bcrnard.no, having for a partner Lewie
Meyerstein cf San Francisco. This ven
ture was very successful and a few years
ago the partnership was dissolved, Mr
Jacobs becoming the sole owner of the
institution.
Mr. Jacobs was a man of generous im
pulse and his deeds of charity were nu
merous but not ostentatious. He held the
office of treasurer of the Masonic Lodre
frcm its organization to his death and
was a prominent member of the Odd Fel
lows, Knights of Pythias. B'nai B'rlth
and Chosen Friends. He leaves four
oaughters-Mrs. OÂ«c_r Newburg of San
Bernardino, Mrs. H. Roman of San Fran

LONDON. Sept. 21.â A flood of election
manifestos appear in the morning papers.
The Conservatives, under the lead of Mr.
Balfour and Mr. Chamberlain, give the
successful war the first place In their
campaign. Sir Henry Campbell-Banner
man. Liberal leader in the House of Com
mons, and Sir William Vernon Harcourt
in their addresses denounce the unprece
dented precipitancy of a dissolution in or
der to snatch a hasty Judgment on an in
complete register of voters.
Sir William Vernon Harcourt refuses
to regard an "ephemeral war" as the sole
test of good government, declaring that,
although from the moment of the Boer
invasion he had supported the Govern
ment, he has not changed his original
opinion that the needed reforms might
have been attained without war.
"The result of the Government's policy,"
says Sir William, "is that we are now
the best hated country in the world and
burdened with an accumulated debt and
an increased taxation. We may well re
gard our national finance with the gravest
apprehension. The cost of the war will
not fall far short of Â£100,000,000."
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman dwells
Â¦upon the "failure of the Government's
diplomacy and preparations for war" and
upon the "miscalculation of Boer
strength."
Ho contends that the struggle might
have been avoided and points out that
there has been a series of difficulties all
over thÂ» world since the Government came
into offlce. Dealing with home reforms,
Sir Henry says:
"Above all stands the necessity of read
justing the powers of the two chambers
in order to prevent the people's ascertain
ed will from being set at naught by irre
sponsible authorities."

A meeting of the joint committee ap

night at the California Hotel. Captain

Colonel Henry I. Kowalsky will deliver
the oration. The available troops at the
Presidio, consisting of the four companies
of the Eighteenth Infantry and one com
pany of the Twenty-fourth Infantry, will
be in the parade, which will form at 1
o'clock at the Eighth avenue and Fulton
street entrance to the park.
A resolution was adopted directing that
all citizens desirous ol participating re

line at 1 p. m. and they will be furnished
with badges tree. The grand marshal re
ported that 2ChX) will be in line. The plat

take place at 2 o'clock. The Veteran Re

lute on this occasion. The committee on
transportation reported that the Sutro
electric and Sutter-street lines had
agreed to put on all the extra cars needed
to carry the various societies to the
Eighth-avenue entrance to the park.
1 WOULD rather be born lucky than
rich," was the remark made by How
ard B. Gale, advance agent of the
"Kelly Kids" Theatrical Company last
night at the Alhambra Theater. Mr
Gale, with Horace G. Sadler, business
manager of the company, left Galveston.
two hours before the outbreak of the
storm, hence his remark, echoed with fer
vor by Mr. Sadler.
"We arrived in Galveston," said Mr.
Gale, "at 12:30 on September 8, the night
before the city was overtaken by the ter
rible windstorm. The appearance of the
sky at that time was threatening. Puffs
of "wind that appeared to gain in strength
as night grew older, were greatly in
evidence. The v sky appeared to have a
greenish hue. and an old sailor on â¢>Â«
train with us said that as long as thÂ«
'green woather,' as he calleu it, .asu-u,
the storm would not amount to much;
but if the sky took on a whitish, smoky
appearance, then look out. His words
proved prophetic, for when we went out
on the street the next morning the sky
had the peculiar color which he described.
The puffs of wind of the night before had
increased to a steady blow. Mr. Sadler
and mvself tacked up cards announcing
the arrival of the company on every
available spot, and had our work for
naught, as they were torn" from the walls
and fences, such was the strength of the
wind. We worked for about two hours
and then took the 7:10 a. m. for Houston.
The wind at this time was blowing most
fiercely, but it was not until we were on
the drawbridge connecting Galveston with
the mainland that we were able to appre
ciate the terrific strength of a Texas
southeaster. Ordinarily the bridge can
be crossed In thirty minutes, but we were
an hour and a half in making the trip.
"At 12 o'clock, when we got into Hous
ton, we felt the force of the storm,
though It was two hours later when It
was fiercest. We could not put up any
paper in Houston, as no one could do
any work. We left it behind us and con
tinued our journey, as the small taste
we had of the blow convinced us we were
safer at a distance.
"I happened to be in St. Louis during
the cyclone that caused such ruin a few
years ago, but that experience was not
to be compared with our trip out of Gal
veston." i Â¦Â¦*Â¦â¢*
"Swimming in the waters surrounding
the city of Galveston, two days previous
to the outbreak of the storm, Miss Mar
guerite Armitage little thought that
within a few short hours the waves that
then afforded her so much pleasure would
prove her last resting place.
"The house where Miss Armitage lived
was within 300 yards of the beach and
bathing was the principal pastime of the
guests, who were, like Marguerite, act
resses showing at the Mascot Theater.
The building was one of the first to be
engulfed, and its inmates were all
drowned."
The photograph of Miss Armitage was
taken by a friend after she had emerged
from the waters but a day or two before
the awful calamity.
ONE OF THE VICTIMS OF THE GREAT STORM AT GALVESTON AND
ONE OF THE MEN WHO LEFT JUST IN TIME WHILE THE HURRI
CANE WAS RISING.
Special Dispatch to The C-11.
APIA, Samoa. Sept. 7.â Since the transi
tion of the government of this country
from the old, unworkable tripartite con
trol of Great Britain, Germany and the
United States, into the partitioned rule of
Germany and America, political affairs
have run more smoothly and the natives
are settling into quietude and assuming a
spirit of contentment. This is due to the
wise choice of the two Governments in
terested in the appointment by Germany
of President Solf as Governor of Ger
man Samoa and the detailing of Com
mander B. F. Tilley by the United States
Government as commandant of the
United States Naval Station, Tutuila.
The peninsula of Mulinuu has been
rebuilt and is once more the seat of
government. The Samoans of German
Samoa have been aJlowed to form a gov
ernment somewhat after that inaugurated
by Colonel Steinberger in 1S74, though
not on auite such an elaborate scale.
The old House of Nobles has been re
established and the House of Representa
tives still exists. Mataafa has been in
stalled as High Chief and his position is
an advisory one with the Governor, and
the native laws are to be passed through
that official's hands before ilnalpromulga
tion. Tamasese has been appointed
Taimua Sill and resides on Mulinuu and
is a neighbor of Mataafa. Malietoa is
still in Fiji, but a seat in the House of
Nobles has been reserved for him, which
he will occupy on his return several
years hence. The Government offices,
hitherto held by British and Americans,
have been filled with German officials and
the former officials are leaving the coun
try.
The form of government which has been
adopted by CommrJidant Tilley, United
States navy, for the people residing
within the limits of the United States
Naval Station, Tutuila. differs from that
now in force In German Samoa. It is es
sentially a native government, having
the protection and guidance of the United
States. The good judgment exercised by
Commandant Tilley in the appointment
of native chiefs to rule the districts,
counties and towns has given great satis
faction. Every native feels that the rule
of the United States is just. Throughout
the country they speak in praise of it and
are well content. Their relatives in
Upolu and Savaii look with envy upon the
good fortune of the natives of Tutuila and
Manua. The United States Samoans are
encouraged by Commandant Tilley in
habits of industry and learning. Com
mandant Tilley insists that the chiefs
should guard well the sanitary conditions
of the villages and that they should urge
upon the people the necessity of good
roads between the villages. They have
responded enthusiastically to the wish of
the commandant and good roads are being
formed and the native plantations are be
ing increased. It Is intended by the na
tives and it is believed possible by the
commandant that the present form of
government will be self-sustaining, as
far as the natives are concerned. It has
been necessary to deal summarily with
two chiefs who tried to take advantage of
the strength and power given them by the
United States Government.
Rapid progress Is being made with the
coaling station at Pago Pago. The Im
mense steel structure for tne storing of
coal is about completed and the wharf is
being constructed upon the new plans de
signed under the supervision of Com
mandant Tilley. it is estimated that the
new plans have saved the Government
Jo<>,000.

HONOLULU. Sept 14.â Judge Reuben
D. Sllllman, Second Circuit Judge, has
tendered his resignation to President Mc-
Kinlcy. The motives are said by the in
cumbent to be a preference for practice
Instead of judicial duties, influenced by
the inadequacy cf the salary. There are
two applicants for the coming vacancy,
George D. Gear and J. DeBolt. Mr. Gear
Is a CaJIfornian and the grandson of
Judge Van ClielT, and his petition to Pres
ident McKinley is signed not only by his
rival, but by the leading members of the
bar. Curiously enough, the contest, if
Fuch it may ho termed, is one between
the Liberal Republicans and the Thurs
tor.ian or "family compact" wins? of the
Republicans. :!ie latter favoring DeBolt.
The want of unity in the Republican par
ty Is apt. not in this respect only, but In
general matters, to steer it to defeat.
Out of the registrations already made
nearly four-fifth are native Hawalians.
many cf whom are willing to Indorse good
Republican nominees, while others feel
Inclined to indorse only Hawaiians for
The Legislature in the hope that the "fam
ily compact" will use their wealth and in
fluence in the Legislature, as has been
done elsewhere.
The Terriiorl.il Convention meets In this
city on The 24th and 2ath instant and
then we shall know more definitely how
we stand. Colonel Sam Parker is almost
certain to receive the nomination for Con
jrressior.a! delegate, and- the general Im
pression of politicians of all creeds is that
he will be elected.
On Monday California's jubilee day

it was found impracticable to obtain the

ST. LOUIS, Sept. 21.-In the destruction
at an early hour to-day of the steamer
War Bagle of the Eagle Packet Company
and the steamer Carrier, operated by the
Calhoun Packet Company, at the foot of
Locust street, one man was burned to
death, another Is missing and a third
painfully Injured and property valued at
$100,000 was destroyed. The wharf boats
Eagle and Illinois were badly damaged
and the cargo of the Carrier, consisting
of wheat, apples and other produce, was
totally, burned. The dead:
JOSEPH SCHULTZ, third clerk of the
War Eagle.
Missing: Henry Holtla of Cincinnati,
second pantryman on the "War Eagle.
Robert Miller, watchman on the War
Eagle, was burned severely about â¢ the
neck and hands.
Twenty passengers, about half the num
ber being women, were asleep on the
Carrier when the fire started and the
crews of both boats barely had time to
run from the boats to the levee before
the flames enveloped the staterooms in
which they had been sleeping. The fire
started at 4 o'clock. The War Eagle had
arrived Thursday morning from Com
merce, Mo., and unloaded her cargo and
would have started back to Commerce
this afternoon. There was no cargo
aboard her.
The Carrier/ a smaller boat, plying be
tween Mosier Landing, 111., and St. Louis,
arrived at 2 o'clock this morning and!
moored beside the War Eagle. On board
her, asleep, were the passengers and crew
and a large cargo. The nre started In
the stateroom of the firemen of the War
I-.agle and is supposed to have been
caused by a spark from a pipe or cigar
ette. The flames soon reached the Car
rier and within half an hour both boats
were burned to the water's edge.
The War Eagle was valued at $60,000
and was not insured. The Carrier a
much smaller boat, was worth $7000, in-
Su^.u J he , da "iage to the wharfboats
and the Carrier's cargo, etc., make up the
remainder pf_the total.

The labor of securing a jury to try Peter
McGlade on a charge of obtaining money
under false pretenses was begun before
Judgre Burnett yesterday morning. Among
the talesmen examined many said they
could not give the defendant a fair and
impartial trial. They were dismissed.
Those accepted to sit on the jury are:
J. Tiedemann, 3574 Twentieth street; J. S.
Merrill, 233 Market street; George A. Cole,
33 Second street; A. Voight. 34 Fourth
street; T. D. McCarthy. 764 Mission street;

Post street; H. Bird, 208 Mason street: G.
J. McCraley, 503 Market street, and H.
Mangels. Hayes and Franklin streets.
A special venire of thirty talesmen was
ordered summoned, returnable' Monday
morning. It is expected that the jury will
be completed out of this list of thirty and
that by afternoon the taking of testimony
will begin.
Among the talesmen examined and dis
missed was H. W. Burmeister. He said
that he had heard the case discussed, but
it was not his fault. He was being shaved,
he said, and the barber commenced on the
McGlade trial and kept up his argument
until. Burmeister departed. District At
torney Byington asked Burmeister to tell
the name of the barber. Attorney T. J.
Leimsn objected. "You can't stop a bar
ber talking." he said. The court agreed.
sustained the objection and dismissed the
tale?man. .

on three charges of burglary. Other
charges may yet be booked p.galnsi her.
Several complaints had* reached police
headquarters from residents in the West
ern Addition about a woman in black
committing burglaries and tue police got
a clew from an article published in Tho
Call about a burglary at the residence ot
Mrs. H. J. Meyers, 1067 Fell street, on
August 23, thaf led to the woman's ar
rest. At that time she was caught in
the house of Mrs. Meyers by Mrs. Cohen,
a neighbor. Mrs. Cohen held her, until
an old man appeared who volunteered to
watch the prisortt-r while Mrs. Cohen went
for a policeman. When Mrs. Cohen re
turned both the woman and the man had
disappeared. Mrs. Cohen was able to
give an accurate description of the woman
to the police and Detectives Harper and
Armstrong v were detailed on the case.
They got Policeman Hamiil to patrol the
Western Addition in search of the woman
and Hamiil succeeded in arresting her
near her residence at 443 Golden Gate ave
nue.
Mrs. Gibbons is a widow and first came
to the notice of the police in the latter
part of 1S69, when she was arrested for
grand larceny. January 12,' 1S70, she was
sent to San Quentin for four years ami
tour months. August 31, 1S77, she was
sent to San Quentin for live years for
burglary, and on July 18. 1889. she was sent
back, to San Quentin for two vears from
Alameda County for grand larceny. Each
time . u he gave a different name.
When searched at the prison Mrs. Gib

THE WOMAN WITH A LONG CRIMINAL RECORD WHO IS CHARGED
â¢ BY THE POLICE WITH COMMITTING NUMEROUS RECENT BUR
GLARIES IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE CITY.
â ?_ â '
The police are Â¦looking' for a notorious
crook known by the name of Jack Lee and
a young woman until recently employed
as .a domestic hy Mrs. Schwartz at 312
Hyde street. The woman's name Is Anna
Stone, and the two aro accused of rob
bing her employer of considerable valu
able jewelry, clothing and a small sum of
money. Lve is well known to the polfce,
having been arrested on several occasions
for larceny and burglary-
About a month ago Mrs. Schwartz, who
is the wife of one of the proprietors of
the Thalia, employed Miss btone. It was
noticed that she trequently met Lee, but
little attention was paid to the fact.
A few days a'ffo Mrs. Schwartz went
downtown to do pome shopping, instruct
ing the servant not to leave the house un
til she returned.
According to the detectives who have
been detailed on the case, immediately
after Mrs. Schwartz had left the house
Lee; who was waiting on the opposite side
of the street, crossed over in response to
a signal by the Stone woman and was ad
mitted to the house by a rear door. Armed
with a â¢'jimmy" he and the woman pro
ceeded to make a determined search for
valuables.
After they had secured several pieces
of jewelry belonging . to Mrs. Schwartz
and a purse containing $10 they evidently
became frightened and quickly . left the
house. The .woman waa seen leaving with
a bundle under her arm.
On her return Mrs. Schwartz at once
discovered the robbery, and suspecting
the servant she' lost no time in notifying
Captain of Detectives Seymour, who de
tailed Detectives Gibson . and Reynolds
and Corporal Anthony on the case. Thus
far the officers have been unable to get
a trace of Lee or the Stone woman. They
believe that after committing "the crime
the pair left the city., presumably going
to Sacramento. The Chief of Police of the
latter place has been wired to arrest them
on sight. v
The Stone -woman is not unknown to the
police. Several months ago she wa,s em
ployed as a servant in a house In the
Western Addition, and during the U.m
porary absence of the family she skipped
with about a thousand dollars' worth of
jewelry belonging to her mistress. She
was arrested a short time afterward for
the crime, but as all the stolen jewelry
was recovered by the detectives her em
ployer refused to prosecute her and the
case against her was dismissed.

larse quantities of Lowell's prose is that \
of the richness and generosity of his na- ;
ture. Nothing In Lowell's essays is eked f
out; "here Is God's plenty." His know 1 - !
edge of fact ami of arn-cdo.e in his treat- \
ment of literary topics Is seemingly i
boundless and his critical cÂ«says have |
the air of being not the clever and showy
expression of masses of knowledge fresh
won for the occasion, but the easy out- j
pouring of stores of learning acquired j
through years of leisurely end happy com- i
munion with books. He is, for example, j
far more copious In thought and fancy |
and illustration than Matthew Arnold. >
whose essays in contrast seem somewhat I
thin and closely calculatedâ directed with j
"malice prepense" toward a single point.
In Lowell's essays there is much of the
exuberance and luxuriant detail of i.ature. j
Lowell's lyrical praise of June in several ;
of his poems is typical of his character Â¦
and hla writings have the wermth, the j
full-hearted ease and the sunnir.esa of j
summer weather. He is human through!
and through and his essays have a racy j
earthlness of substance and an aromatic |
fragrance of wild, natural life that re- j
move them far from the resions of Icy !
academicism. He. had "mixed his bloo.1 ]
with sunshine" and "taken the winds Into j
his pulses."
Up to the very lastâ Â«ven after his years
of brilliant foreign serviceâ Lowell wad
wont to speak of himself as "a book
man" and doubtless it is as a writer about
books that he will finally be distinctlvefy
remembered. Air. Leslie Stephen has left
in a published letter a delightfully vivid
Sketch of Lowell in his Elmwood study:

by him and enjoy Intervals of silence as wejl
as periods of discussion and always delightful
talk.
This picture of Lowell as an American
scholar devoted to letters is worth special
emphasis because of the- fact that Ills
social successes abroad have tended some
what to pervert his image in the popular
mind into that of a polished society func
tionary and a welcome and well pleased
dweller in kings' houses. Great Indeed
was the favor he won in England as a
graceful unveiler of busts and as a skilled
coiner of after-dinner epigrams; very
genuirie, too, and deep was his apprecia
tionâas appears from his lettersâ of the
Â¦peculiar position he attained in Engli*n
' society and of the intensely stimulating
human intercourse to which it admitted
-him. In the later years of his American
life at Deerfoot he seems sometimes to
have missed rather keenly in his "cell"
there the "breakfasts, luncheons, teas,
dinners and 'goinps-or/ " of his London
I life. Yet he insists that after all he
j "likes Deerfnot best." r.nd no. fair reader
of his later letters or later writings can
i Justly accuse Lowell cf having been
spoiled by his foreign popularity or of
having lost any of his early ardent an<l
I almost religious love for American ideais
and the best types of American character.
Lowell's addresses on political subjects
ought to be gathered together into a sin
gle cheap volume and sent broadcast
through the land. Nowhere are the dan
gers of modern democracy more wisely
and wittily set forth, always, however
Kwlth concurrent unfaltering faith In the
I worth of the democratic ideal and in the
certainty of its future. There is not much
scientific thoroughness or acumen In Low
ell's comments on Institutions and polit
ical tendencies, very little philosophic sug
gestivene!Â«s such as is found in Sir Henry
Maine's or Mr. Bryce|s treatment of simi
i lar topics. But there is great practical
I wisdom, abundant Intuitive insight into
the American character and Its elements
of weakness and strength, and a wise and
acomplished sense of the possible value
to Americans of foreign experiments and
methods and traditions, and. finally, there
is everywhere a glowing affection for the
faith of the fathers and a noble loyalty
to ideals in politicsâ a faith and a loyalty
that we nowadays perhaps more than
ever need to have eloquently expressed
by way of countercheck to the "smart"
selfishness of many of our practical poli
ticians, and also to the satirical superior
ity of the "remnant." who too often in
jure their cause by their airs and affecta
tions. Lowell's wise earnestness and fer
vent urbanity impress and conciliate In
stead of rasping and repelling. In his
political utterances there is united more
perfectly than anywhere else the wisdom
of the fathers that bfprat us. tho assimf
lated worth of contemporary political ex
periments abroad and a shrewd apprecia

of "practical politics" in America.
But after all. in spitf* of tho strrlint;
Baltic of the political addresses. It is Low
ell, the hookman. who is likely to bo
most perennially interesting in the history
nf f<ur literature. He i.-Â» beyond debÂ»t"
the trrfatrst of our rrifir.*, ami he hai
left, of all our writers, the most consid

purely literary problems. His method
and manner as a critic vary wide
ly. At times he la thÂ«Â» revlower
pur<Â» and . simpleâ dogmatic, caustic,
contemporaneous, partisan. His es
say on Carlyle's Frederick Is written In
this vein; It ia searching, suggestive, im
pressively competent, but somewhat in
temperate In trne, violent both in pralsÂ«
and blame. Hometimes his essays are
faithful scholastic discussions of his sub
jects, treat thoroughly and systematical
ly the life as well as the works of his
author, and consider patiently the tradi
tional cruxes and the conventional doutoa
and questions that his author's name sug
gests. Hhi Dryden (a favorite essay with
IÂ«owell himself)â is of this type. Some
times he is wayward, capricious, purely
appreciativeâ a willful goss'per about
likes and dislikes in literature. But what
ever his method or vein, he is always an>l
invariably a man, and he never loses sight
of lifo and of the human worth of his
subject. Ouf scholarship nowadays tÂ°nrt*
rHsastrously to hole-and-corner work.
Myopic porinar over trifles â that i.-* what
many of our Teutonically trained student*
devote themselves to. Some Frenchman
has called our agp "the age of tho mi
crobe." and. indeed, in scholarship, h*
everywhere else, the misrht and the worth
of the infinitely little have been perhaps
fxaeserated. or at any rate the study
of the infinitely small has been monnpo
lizinerly carried o'n to the detriment of th*
indubitably great. IntÂ»- this latter-day neg
lect of the vital in scholarship Lowell Â»a
never betrayed. He is always master oi
his learning. Whatever the age or tho
man or the book he discusses, hi* imag
ination finds underneath the facts anil
the technical problems involved some- per
manent human interest, the dramatic In
terest of character in action, the artistic
interest of embodied beauty, the philo
sophic interest of social and spiritual
forces carrying on the progress of th^
race.' With Lowell scholarship always
subserves life and ministers to the pres
ent needs of the human spirit.
Lowell's poetry, apart from the BiÂ£e
low Papers." falls Into three period*, or
which the second contains what is finest
and most imaginative. Before ISj) hit
poetry is. for the most part, despite some
poems that will always be favorites, over
rhetorical and declamatory; much of It is
grotesquely Imitative of English models:
"Rosaline" is palpably Inspired by Tenny
son and "A Legend of Brittany" Is full
of absurd echoes of Keats' rhythms and
tricks of manner. "â¢Rhoecus." "Colum
bus," "Hunger and Cold" and "To tho
Dandelion" are among the more original
and permanently delightful of the pot>ms
of the first period. "The Present Crisis"
is magnificent rhetoric. Is filled with noble
passion for truth and right, and rises now
and then to passages of memorable po^Â°r
and beauty; yet it is eloquence rather
than poetry pure and simple. In many
of the poems in "Under thÂ«Â» Willows." on
the other hand, In "The Washing of the
Shroud" and in parts of "The Commemo
ration Ode" Lowell is really creative; ha
no longer merely talks in meter about
j Ideas and feelings and expatiates on them
' through the help of brilliant figures, but
he rises into a reerion of intense lyrical
feeling where every object is radiantly
alive with imaginative meaning and
I where beauty of imagi and music of
phrase work together to instill a mood
and a. thousht into the. render's mind.
There is also far more sensuous splendor
in these poems of the second period than
In Lowell's earlier work; the infpnse.
vibrant impressionism of "The Apnledore"
sketches in "Under tho Willows" fairly
rivals Mr. Swinburne's outdoor canvases,
and the title poem. "Under the Willows."
contains some lustrous river landscape
whose rich Impasto and emotional glow
will always be specially dear to dwell
ers by the Charles. The poems of Low
ell's third period, to be found for the
most part in "Heartsease ami Rue." are
often supgestjve of Landor. They are for
the most part permeated with a genial
worldly wisdom through which there
often sounds a note of Horatian half
playful sadness. They seem tho work of
an accomplished scholar who smiles out
upon life and back upon his earlier years
of Ideal enthusiasm with kindly tolerance
and yet by no means with entire dis
belief in Ideals and certainly without
cynicism.
Though Lowell was greatly Long-fel
low's superior in vigor of thought, he
had not Longfellow's singing instinct;
too often In Lowell's verse the prose in
tellectual processes fall to "pass In music
out of sight." As an essayist and a
writer of literary "causeries" he Is with
out a rival among our American authors
His urbanity, his common sense and de
licious worldly wisdom, his large and sane
outlook over life, his union of scholarship
with artistic sensitiveness, his Inexhaust
ible geniality and his Inveterately busy
sense of humor unite to give his essays
perennial charm and value.

The clean anti-boss Republicans of San
Francisco deeply regret the fact that a
boss cloud hangs over the Municipal Nom
inating Convention. It was hoped that the
â¢JFiegat^*, in view of the universal desire
for harmony, would displace the tempo
rary chairman selected by Martin Ke:ly,
but the action of the body in making Ber
gerot permanent chairman caused great
tiepress-ion in the ranks of the party. The

Kelly and his henchmen, is highly com

The agitation on the part of the Re

immediate registration of all voters who
have failed to register this year is havin?
r, pood effect.
All citizens should bear in mind that
â¢-,e law requires every voter to re-register
f^r the general election this year. Many
residents ctlll entertain the notion that
â¢hey can vote this year without re-regis
terlng If they have not changed their
rlaces of residence eince the last election.
They to not eeein to comprehend that the
'.aw requires new registration throughout
the State. The opportunity afforded to
day for precinct registration should not
be overlooked.
The State Central Committee has
mapped out Governor Gage's campaign
tour. The Governor conferred with Col
onel Stone and Senator Cutter yesterday
and placed himself In their hands, author
izing the committee to send him wherever
Sn the judgment of the committee he could
render the party the best service as a

that the Governor shouhi address the

sive orders. In a general sense, good peo
ple who despise all nossfs and all boss
methods have more toleration for a fear
less and audacious boss than they have
for a cunning and cowardly boss politi
cian. Kelly has asserted his mastery of
the boss camp in a style somewhat dis
pleasing to Dibble, Lynch and Crimmlns,
but he has made it known to hi3 asso
ciates in the boss camp that goods cannot
be delivered without the Kelly "O.K."
Bogus telegrams may be played on the In
nocent and unsuspecting but not on Boss
Kelly. No doubt valuaole hints in this
Hn* of political management were ob
tained from Sam Rainey. When Kelly
took the floor and placed Bergerot in
nomination for temporary chairman he Is
sued a challenge of combat to the anti

his challenge.

The Interview was very brief but cor
dial. It took place in the hotel corridor.
Mr. Knowlton promised to submit his case
in writing as requested. Supterintendent
Kirk said after vt\\ interview that he dis
liked .to be called upon to fettle questions
between the San Francisco school officials*,
whom he thought capable of taking care
of their affairs, but he would not shirk
his duty if he found the matter came with
In his jurisdiction. He said: "I am a
public servant and cannot avoid a re
sponsibility. I, of course, must hear both
Bides of this question before giving an
opinion."
But Superintendent Kirk' was not ready
to hear Knowlton verbally. "If.ycu will
put your case in writing and address it
to me I.will take the matter under con
sideration," said Kirk to Knowlton, add
ing:
"I am not sure whether this is a ques
tion for me to pass judgment upon. After
I have received your grievance in writing
I will decide whether or not It comes with
in my official Jurisdiction. If it does. I
will instruct Mr. Webster to Investigate
the causes and report the facts to me and
when I receive them I will try to decide
the matter."
Knowlton carried a small satchel, which
contained various papers and documents
which he intended to present to the State
Superintendent In defense of his case. He
had expected that Kirk would give him a
lengthy hearing:, as in a case of this kind
where pay has been withheld the defend
ant has the privilege of appealing to the
State Superintendent, whose ruling in the
matter is final.
State Superintendent Thomas J. Kirk
returned from the normal school confer
ence In San Jose yesterday afternoon and
ha found" Superintendent of Schools AVeb
eter and Vice Principal Knowlton, recent
ly suspended lor a year, awaiting him at
the Palace Hotel. Mr. Webster wrote to
Kirk a Â¦ week ago that he desired to sea

But Coffee Was the Cause oÂ£ the
Trouble.
An old veteran from Springfield,
Mass.. made a curious experiment in the
i:tc of tobacco and coffee. He says: "I
have been an incessant smoker for forty
years, using "at times twenty cigars a
day. besides several pipes. I was also
very fond of coffee.
'"In 1893 I noticed my stomach was
becoming weak and that I could not
retain my breakfast- Within six months
afterward I had arrived at that stage
where I vomited up at least five break-
fasts each week. The doctor claimed
that the sickness was caused by smok-
ing, fo I went under the care of Dr.
Barbault of Spencer. Mass., who cured
r.ic of Â«he tobacco habit. For eight
months I refrained from its use. but the
vomiting still continued. ;':Â¦;;*"'.-;
-Mv physician then attributed it *o
catarrh. 'so' I carefully dosed myself with
the catarrh cures, but the vomiting be-
came more severe, though not more fre-
quent. I therefore concluded to resume
my smoking and get as much comfort
U possible in that direction. I noticed
that the smoking did not increase the
vomiting. â ...
â¢Quite a time after that I met a fnend
wbo in one minute put me on the rifcht
track by telling me that he was satisfied
that it was coffee that caused my trou-
ble. I stopped drinking coffee, and
withi-n a week the vomiting ceased cn-
-irrlv.
"Sho'lly after that I took" to using
Dostum Food Coffee and found it filled
sil the requirements of coffee. My
family arc using it rcgularlv. and likr it
as v.cll as> the best Java coffee, after be-
<-ora3ng accustomed to its use. We know

CHICAGO. Sept. II.â "With Liverpool only %d
lower. In the face of the slump r-ere yesterday,
there was some buying of wheat when the
market openedâ October at 7Sc to 77TÂ»c. The
steadiness was short-lived, however, for heavy
amounts were for sale under the influence of
clear and cool weather In the Northwest. The
stuff bought early was unloaded In the gen
eral rush cf liquidation and before the bulls
could muster any force, October had declined
to 76T4c. A good ehlpplngr demand made Its
appearance. Commission houses had heavy
buying orders, which had been waiting for the
market to cet under 77c. Northwest markets,
easy early, turned strong and damage reports
from the spring wheat territory were numer
ous and very gloomy. Estimates of a bO.OOO.CKXi
bushel crop were made and a French crop or
gan estimated a shortage In the world's crop
of 120.OCO.000 bushels. Local shorts, moved by
these considerations, found wheat hard to get
and a sharp rally to 7S^4@7Si4c for October fol
lowed. The close was strong, October $iC over
yesterday at 7S 1 ic
Corn was weak early, strong later and n.t all
times quiet. October closed %@V4c higher.
NEW YORK. Fept. 21.â There was cor.sid
rrable further liquidation in to-day's stock
market, but prices showed e^rr.e resistance a.'.'.
day and In the later trading there was quUe
general recoveries on the Â»Â»arly .esses and small
net fcains are the rule. The latÂ» recovery did
r.ot. however, bring rri^es fully up to the

Tbe professional operators in New York seemed
sufpiclous of the rise in London and of the

1. tably and Brooklyn Transit. They
therefore Bold these etneks with assurance a'

considerable stllir:^ orders from outslit

The next week will probably see final action
taken as to the remaining wage scale, as tc
which depressing reports are current, 'in the
general metal market the feature was the col
lapse of tin prices, due to the reports of the
smashing of the tin corner. '
Raw cotton and cotton coeds have parted
company as to prices this week. The rush of
buyers to secure stocks has advanced print
cloths, ginghams, bleached goods, prints
and, in fact, nearly all classes of cottons, while
materially reducing stocks In the hands of com
mission men and Jobbers. Meet manufacturers
are refusing to take orders ahead except "at
value," based ucon the cost of the raw ma
terial. A little more is reported doing in raw
wool, but It Is mostly to supply current needs
of manufacturers and no large amounts of wool
can be moved, except at concessions. The spring
business in men's woolen is still disappoint
ing. Reports of damage to grain shocked in the
Northwest are reinforced by Northwestern buy
ing at Chlcaco and furnished the key to the
advance of near 2c In wheat this week fol
lowed by a gain of 20c to 25c In flour and of l>,ic
In corn. Some of this advance In wheat was
afterward lost In realizing. Other farm prod
ucts were higher, pork and lard advancing on
better export business and butter and cheeÂ»e on
Improved weather. Iron and steel are rather
quiet as a whole and some weakness is noted
In Southern pig and steel billets at Pittsburgh
On thÂ« other hand finished products are as a
rule firm and bars are to be advanced $1 at Chi
cago. Export Inquiry continues good, but the
high ocean rates and the scarcity of any kind
of freight room renders the outlook uncertain
In the meanwhile American bars and plates are
underselling brand Scotch goods at the latter
points of productions. r
The unfavorable turn given the general indus
trial situation by the strike of anthracite coal
miners and the possibility of wage disputes In
the Iron trade, with rather less activity In the
latter industry and some increase of weakness
in the prices of cruder forms, have given an ap
pearance of Irregularity to the general trade
and business situation. On the other hand the
course of staple prices has been very generally
upward this week, fall distribution of dry
goods, clothing, hats and mtllnery has been of
large volume at nearly all maikets, there Is a
decidedly better . tone noted in the boot and
shoe and kindred trades and the strength of
cqtton goods, though apparently in excess of
that shown by the raw material, is Indicative
of the confidence on the part of manufacturers.
The premature opening due to hot, dry weather
Is responsible for a portion of the heavy move
ment of cotton to market, but back of this oÂ£
course is the desire to profit by the exceedingly
good prices ruling. The rush of receipts has
been too much for the bull movement, however,
and the prices materially lower on the week.

NEW TORK, Sept. 21.â Bradstreet's financial
review to-morrow will ray:
A more decidedly reactionary disposition
showed Itself In speculation this week. Prices
were decidedly weak last Saturday, and though
support was extended to the market on Mon
day and Tuesday and the short Interest covered
contracts rather extensively on those days, the
Improvement was slight and the tone continued
to be nervous. The developments In connec
tion with the strike of anthracite coal miners,
while inconclusive as to the question of a gen
eral stoppage in that industry, seemed to Wall
street to point to a long and possibly trouble
j-ome struggle with labor, and the market also
takes into consideration not only the chances of
an extension of labor disturbances to other
trades, but the effects of such circumstances
on the political situation. Indeed, politics is
now receiving a degree of attention en the
part of the speculative community svhich con
trasts In a striking manner with the Indiffer
ence about the Presidential contest that has
heretofore prevailed. The uncertainty attend
ing the contest in November Is receiving con
sideration, anfl naturally produces additional
conservatism on the part of financial houses
and the stock market generally. The situa
tion of the money market was a bearish factor.
The large decrease in cash and surplus aver
ages shewn by last Saturday's bank statement
reflects withdrawals of money to the interior
for crop movement purposes plus the decreased
disbursements cf the Treasury. These facts
promise to result In another poor bank state
ment to-morrow, and It is noted that the sup
ply of time money has decreased, while lenders
show a decided disposition to Insist on higher
rates. An unfavorable effect of a sentimental
kind was made by Germany placing a fT>an of
J20.000.0CO. one of th- effects bflng to give Ber
lin power to draw gold from London and cause
a hardening of interest rates at the latter city.
whUe they declined at Berlin. The reports that
other foreign governments have been en
couraged by the success of the British and Ger
man loans in our markets to undertake nego
tiations for similar operations on this side were
also considered as pointing to decided efforts
to take advantage of the abundance of capital
here and as possibly involving a diminution of
the supplies of funds which enabled Wall street

and dullness fails to cause lower prices. For
e'sn conditions are unsatisfactory, especially In
France, but fair prices are expected at the
London sales next month.
In Iron and steel products greater activity at
Â¦jrmer prices was the rule. New contracts
vi'Â»re for moderate accounts; but a large order
for malleable Bessemer pig-iron at Southern
points makes the outlook more encouraging and
a Scotch concern is only prevented from closing
a very large contract for billets by the high
ocean freight rates prevailing. The break
in Scotch piglron warrants had. an International
significance. Puddlers and bar rollers are still
waiting their turn for wage settlement. Orders
for railroad equipment for September are ex

dangered a large section of Alden to-night
during a flre that destroyed a large barn,
owned by C. Sorenson, on Shafter avenue
and Forty-ninth street. The structure
was In the rear of the Columbus-avenue
Presbyterian Church, which -was on flre
peveral times. It was saved by a volun
teer bucket brigade of men and women,
who were compelled, because of the cut
ting of the water-hydrant supply, to se-
Fire but No Water.
Crazed from the effects of liquor, R. W.
Willis, a painter, brutally kicked his wife
last evening, from the effects of which
phe Is likely to die. The Willises live at
10S0 Howard street. Shortly after 5 o'clock
lajÂ»t evening Willis went home drunk and
not finding his wife home went in Â»earch
of her. He found her at her sister's home
and ordered her to go with him, and when
she refused he brutally kicked her. The
unfortunate woman was picked up in an
unconscious condition and removed to the
Receiving Honpltal. The doctors, after
an examination, gave as their opinion
that fhe was fatally Injured.
Willis was arrested by Detectives Rior
dnn and O'Dea and locked up in the
tanks. He will be held pending the result
of his wife's injuries.

"I feel that no more fitting comment can
be made than to quote the words of Abra
ham Lincoln: 'When tlie victory shall be
complete, when there shall be neither
slave nor drunkard on the earth, how
proud the title of that land which may
freely claim to be the birthplace of the
crusade of both revolutions that shall
have ended In that victoryâ how nobly
distinguished that people who shai: have
planted and nurtured to maturity both
the political and moral freedom of their
species!' "
Mrs. D. T. Curtis, president of Oakland
Union, reported that an effort was being
made to boycott nil grocery stores which
sold liquors. She said Mayor Snow had
expressed himself as opposed to the cUr
fÂ«w ordinance, believing that to arrest
boys that violated it waa more demoral
izing than the fact that they were on the
streets after 9 o'clock at night. The
Mayor had suggested that parents should
keep their children off the streets after
the 9 o'clock hour.

Court Reserves Decision as to Wheth
er Second. Codicil Was Legally
Made.
OAKLAND. Sept. 21.â At the conclusion
of the testimony in the Hlndman will con
test thl? morning Judge Greene decided
that Edmund Hindman was mentally

codicil made June 16. 1S93, which is belnjr
contested, was appended In regular legal

Greene ordered that a' continuance be
taken until . October, 6, when final argu

Depreciation of Money.
In 1S73 a silver dollar was worth one dollar
and six-lenths in gold. In 1S78. eighty-nine
cents; in 1SS3, eight-five cent?: In 1SSS, seventy
two cents: In 1S93. sixty cents and In 1S36 forty
five cent*. Money may depreciate but there is
one standard stomach remedy, which has not
changed In half a century, and that Is Hos
tetter's Stomach Bitters. It always has been
the one unsurpassed remedy for indigestion
dyspepsia, liver or kidney troubles. \-: _

Fire Near Sacramento.
SACRAMENTO. Sept. 21.-Early this
morning a fire started on the Olson ranch,
about twelve miles east Â»f the city, and
at last accounts It was sweeping over
the stubble fields before a stiff northwest
wind. Scores of people were out fighting
the flames, but it was still making head
way over the dry grain fields. The Olson
residence, barn and outbuildings were
burned and It was feared that others
would go. Fences were, of course, wiped
out.
Many Men Fighting Flames.
SAN BERNARDINO, Sept. 21.-A de
structive fire is raging on the forest reser
vation north of this city. Thousands of
acres have been burned over, reaching
from Houston's Flat to Strawberry Peak,
a distance of over five miles. The flames
are now being fanned by a high north
wind. A large force of men is fighting the
flames.
OAKLAND. Sept. 21.â Carrie Jackson
will not be excluded from the benefits of
the Fruitvale public school because of
her epilepsy, but she will not be allowed
to attend any regular class. She will come
each day to school and her work will be
allotted to her to take home. The fol
lowing day the child will return with th<*
results of her labors for corrections ami
suggestions from her teacher.
This was the compromise course agreed,
upon this evening by the Frultvale School
Trustees, who decided that although the
child was not the proper associate of ner
vous pupll3 of a tender age. she should
not be excluded from the school altogeth
er. She will not be allowed to rejoin her
class as a regular scholar until she shows
some improvement in her condition.
The home plan of teaching the child
work was accepted by the trustees as a
compromise between the proposition to
exclude her altogether and the desire of
her father, who insists that his daughter
shall attend the Fruitvale school as a reg
ular scholar. Charles Jackson was not
present at the meeting of the trustees this
evening, but Trustee r>unlevy stated that
Jackson would probably not agree to the
plan decided upon.
"Jackson has said that he will fight this
matter." said Trustee DunleVy. "if it costs
him every cent he has. He says his child
shall attend the Fruitvale school, if every
other child In the district is compelled to
move away. We all feel sorry for the lit
tle one. but the good of the greatest num
ber must be considered. It la the desire
of this board to treat the child fairly ami
to see that she is deprived of nothing that
can benefit her. and that is why we did
not take advantage of the District Attor
ney's opinion which saya we may exclude
the girl."
SHE MAY BE WITH
NOT OF THE SCHOOL
The Pitts District Schoolhouse
was directly In the path of the con
flagration. Miss Holly, the teacher,
armed her pupils with wet Backs,
the weapons with which stubble
and grass flres are fought, and the
flames were beaten off and stopped
almost at the very door of the lit
tle schoolhouse. When this feat
had been accomplished teacher and
pupils were almost ready to suc
cumb from exhaustion, but they
had won the admiration of every
resident of Dlxon to repay them
for their devotion.
D1XON, Sept. 21.â To the coolness
and bravery of Miss Blanche Holly
was due the saving of the Pitts
District Schoolhouse from destruc
tion by flames to-day. A spark from
an engine started a fire in a grove
of eucalyptus trees on the farm of
James Porter, about a mile from
Dlxon. The flames leaped through
the grove and across an orchard
to a field of heavy summer fallow
stubble belonging to ex-Senator H.
E. McCune. They swept rapidly
over the field and across the county
road.

WOMAN'S BRAVERY
SAVES SCHOOLHOUSE
FROM DESTRUCTION
Much of the property burnt over was
railroad land. The dry grass was In
places two feet high. The eucalyptus
groves on the hills caught, but were not
It was almost impossible to get any
water !n that part of town, so the flre
flghting had to be done with sacks- Sturt
evant's house was the only one which the
firemen could reach with a line of hose.
While the main fire was coming from the
north a Feonnd flrÂ«Â» started up near the old
Alameda Water Company's reservoir and
burned over tho hills east of Berkeley. So
great was the heat and so stifling the
smoke that It was Impossible, for men to
fight any length of time. It was only the
number of workers that saved the threat
ened places.
The fence around C. Sturtevant's home
was burned and tlie house was on fire
when the flre companies managed to get
a stream on it. The Robert Annis and K.
Larcher places were threatened.
At the Martin ranch, about a mile from
Berkeley, two outhouses were burned and
the other buildings were saved only after
hard work. The barn of H. K. Hawley's
suburban home caught on flre and the
house In which his servants sleep was in
flames twice before they were finally res
cued. An outbuilding was burned. Mr.
Hawloy is confined to his bed with paraly
sis and his home was so closely sur
rounded by flames that assistance was
sent for to remove him to a place of
safety.
The fire reached over the hills at 10
o'clock this morning along the western
range from Contra Costa County toward
Berkeley. A hot north wind, which had
been blowing since yesterday, not only
nerved to fan the flames but had dried
everything up beforehand. At every farm
house the fire was fought and a crowd
of men. mostly Berkeley volunteer fire
men, went out over the hills and met the
flames a mile from town in the hope of
stopping them there. The men were com
pelled to retreat to town and to exert
themselves in saving houses. The fire did
not stop at North Berkeley until all the
material in its way had been burned out.
Several outbuildings and outlying barns
were destroyed and miles of fencing were
burned.
When the fire worked over the Berke
ley hills it was thought the upper por
tion of the college town was doomed. The
sweep of flame was slopped only by the
paved streets. A dozen suburban homes
were saved only by the indefatigable
work of volunteer firemen.
Between the starting point and the
Berkeley ridge of dividing hills there are
many small farms, from which it Is im
possible to obtain reports concerning the
possible damage. The ranchers around
Lafayette believe that the flre vras con
fined to the brush and the timber in the
hills and canyons.
The flames swept over a large section
of the Moraga grant territory. There are
many Portuguese ranchers on the grant
who have small places. There had been
no reports at Lafayette to-night of losses,
although couriers coming in from the
scene said there were many narrow es
capes.
The most serious losses reported were
from the destruction of miles upon miles
of fencing. It is likely that some stock
has been burned.
The fire started In a brush pasture on
the side hills in Baronl's Valley at the
Burton ranch, southwest of Lafayette.
The men on that ranch were called out
and organized to fight the flames. Around
all of the ranch houses and property grain
and hay stacks the ground was plowed
for acres to stop the sweep. The sweep
of the fire with the strong wind of last
night was irresistible. The flames ran
over the hills and swept through the
brush and forests on the Simon Blum
ranch of 12,000 acres. Reports from that
section are to the effect that the damage
was only to the pasture lands. The fire
was kept off the ranch houses.
A determined fight was made at the
Elam Brown ranch and the farmers suc
ceeded in preventing serious damage
there.
The fire spread toward Grizzly Peak. It
is hoped that the dying out of the wind
will enable the fighters to get the fire
under control before It gets over the
ridge into the range behind the university
grounds.
In North Berkeley Beveral houses were
scorched by the fires, and hundreds ot
men went out to fight the swiftly running
flames.
Great volumes of smoke from the fires
have hung all day over the city, and as
the fire worked toward the Berkeley hills
there was an intense heat raised which
accentuated the high temperature caused
by the "norther."
OAKLAND, Sept. 21.â Brush fires started
last night in Baronl's Valley, three miles
from Lafayette, Contra Costa County,
swept with tremendous rapidity through
the valley and the adjacent gulches and
hills, reaching into the northern bounda
ries of Berkeley. The high winds from
the north drove the flames ahead with
such force that the ranchers were com
pelled to battle for hours with every re
source at their command. Back firing
was resorted to that the houses and grain
piles over the burned district might be
saved.
Blaze Near Ben Lomond.
Special DlFpatch to The Call.
SANTA CRUZ, Sept. 21.â A brush and
forest fire has ragtd yesterday and to
day near Ben Lomond. The fire on thÂ«
ridge nt Graham Hill started again, but
did not do much damage. The damage
done by the new blazo was the burning
of a barn and itÂ«* contents, acres of pas
turage, much cord wood belonging to va
rious woodchoppers and a mile of fencing
belonging to D. M. Locke.
Hard fire fighting saved hundreds of
acres cf pasturage and much timber.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WOODLAND, Sept. 21.â During the high
wind yesterday a fire swept over a large
area between Dunnigan and Blacks. Rich
ard Powers, near Dunnigan, was a heavy
loser. All his grain, hay and seed wheat
were destroyed. He lost every building
on the place except his dwelling. At one
time he abandoned all hope of saving his
residence, and the family carried out the
household goods. The house was eventu
ally saved, but the goods caught on fire
and were destroyed.
The full extent of the damages on the
T. F. Laugenour farm have not yet been
ascertained, but It is known that a great
deal of fencing, two big piles of baled hay
and 160 acres of hay In the shock were
burned.
Special Dltpatch to The Call.
BENICIA, Sept. 21.â During high winds
yesterday several field fires were started
on ranches north and west of Benicia and
they have spread at a furious rate. The
fires are still burning and enormous dam
age has been done. Reports have it
that several ranchers in Sulphur Spring
Valley are left almost homeless. Large
quantities of pasturage and grain and
miles of fences were destroyed.
A fire started on Daniel O'Connell's
ranch and was driven south across the
Tobin ranch into Spring Valley, where a
large area of stubble was burned and
much fencing destroyed. On White's
ranch two stacks of newly threshed
gain were consumed. The fire Is sup
posed to have started on the Page Tract,
near Cordelia, through the carelessness of
an employe of the Bay Counties Power
Company in blasting. Dense volumes of
smoke from the fire are still plainly vis
ible in the direction of Suisun and the
atmosphere is sultry.

biggest conflagration in this section since
the destructive fire at Black Point thirty
five years ago.
Chief Adams of the Petaluma Fire De
partment went out to reconnoiter. but.
owing to the great distance, returned
without any new information. A demand
for a force of men from this city to go
out to tight the fire is expected at any
moment.
SAN RAFAEL. Sept. 21.â A large fire
started on the De Long ranch, about four
miles from Novato, at noon to-day. The
fire has Bwept several ranches, among
them the ranch of Adolph Scown. Aided
by a strong northeasterly breeze the fire
is now sweeping In a southerly direction
across the head of Lucas Valley.
Shortly after It started nearly a hundred
men were employed in an effort to subdue
it, but owing to the excessive heat and
the rapidity with which the wind drove
the flames they could accomplish noth
ing. To-night the wind has somewhat
subsided and the fire may be checked
before morning. The residents of this city
and of Mill Valley were very much ex
cited, as great clouds of emoke blew over
the ridges and passed over Mount Tamal
pals. It is believed that the fire started
In a charcoal-burning camp on the De
Long ranch.
Another grass fire started on Point San
Pedro this afternoon, but was soon put
under control. About a hundred acres
were burned over. The reclaimed land be
low this city also came In for a scorching.
About eighty acres were burned over.
The total damage to the grazing land
In this county by fire to-day Is unknown,
but a conservative ertimate places the
number of acres denuded at nearly 2000.

PETALUMA, Sept. 21.-A report reached
this city this afternoon that a grass and
timber fire was raging on the Novata
hand Company's ranch, near Novata. R
D. Hatch, proprietor of the ranch, who
was in Petaluma on business to-day, re
ceived a telegram urging him to return
immediately to the ranch. The fire was
then sweeping through a densely wooded
canyon. It is said fifteen square mi'^s of
country has already been desolated by
the fire. Thousands of dollars probabiy
will be lost in timber alone, as the No
vata Land Company's ranch is covered
by a thick growth of oak trees.
George Clark, the representative of the
Burdell ranch which adjoins that whicli
the fire Is burning, says that this is the

STOCKTON, Sept. 21.â A Herce fire
swept over the country around Clements
in this county last evening. The high
wind carried the flames along with re
lentless force, destroying property and at
several points nearly claiming lives. How
the blaze started is not known, but the
fields are very dry and a single spark
could account for the beginning. It had
Its inception on the Langford place, near
the Clements bridge. It burned along
the river for nine miles to Childs Creek,
sweeping everything. The wind blew a
gale and fighting the fire was useless.
At Childs Creek the flames jumped the
Mokelumne River, over 200 feet wide, and
started on the south side at the old
Stamper place. It was then nearlv 11
o'clock last night. A large force of farm
ers, augmented by miners working at the
mines there, finally controlled the fire, as
the wind went down. The full amount of
the damage is not known, but It is re
ported that Ed Hart lost his house, Fheds
and barn full of hay, besides much fenc
ing; Peter Fitzgerald a big new barn and
fencing and a big haystack; John Hay
maker sheds, barn, hay and fences; Mrs.
Ix>na Beamerts fencing to about $1000 in
value and a stack of grain.
Mrs. Beamert left her place In flames at
10 o'clock last night. Her grain pile was
then on fire and the buildings were all but
destroyed.
The whole country around Clements
looks desolate and black. All the pasture
and much Bruin and hay have been burn
ed. The loss probably will reach well into
the thousands. The path of the flames
was on an average four miles broad.
Buildings, Fences and Grain Stock
Destroyed Around Clements.
It Is Estimated That Twenty Thousand Acres Have Been Burned

Mrs. Howe continues with a tale about
how Pardee forced her to employ ono
Maud Ellsworth as a housekeeper. The
complainant declared that after Pardee
and her brother had the trouble she or
dered Mrs. Kllsworth to leave her employ.
Mrs. Howe added much about Pardee's
alleged attempts to force money from her
at various times. She declares that he
referred to Chief of Police Hodgklns as
troubled with the "bis head," and that
Mrs. Ellsworth had claimed Pardee had
"pull" enough with the Police Commis
sioners to save himself.
In her formal affidavit, Mrs. Howe,
among other matters, complains that
Pardee had compelled her to give him $18
because of his alleged care of her brother.
She claimed also that Pardee had de
manded $250 from her, saying he had
made arrangements to place her brother,
who now accuses the policeman, in a
private hospital in San Francisco.
The Commissioners this morning heard
Attorney L. S. Church cross-examine
Mrs. Howe at great length, but very little
progress was made. Monday the Board
will go at the case again, and the fifty
or more witnesses who have been dancing
attendance upon the , secret meetings will
be lined up for their testimony nearly
every particle of which relates exclusively
to the character of the Howes and
Pardee.
Pardee's friends declare that the charges
are the -wildest of vagaries. But Mrs.
Howe Insists upon their truth. The Is3uo
is between them.
The accusations In detail of Mrs. A. D.
Howe against Policeman Thomas Pardee
have reached the public eye. The charge3
were included in a lengthy typewritten
document which as soon as it was tiled
with the Board of Police and Fire Com
missioners was buried from the gaze of
all save the officials Interested and Par

DR. EDWARD MARKBREITER WARNS THE GERMAN REPUBLICANS
OF SAN FRANCIS" :O NOT TO BE MISLED BY THE DEMOCRATIC
APPARITIONS OF IMPiihlALISM AND MILITARISM
Robbed by a Chinese Servant
Mrs. McKenney. who conducts a lodg
ing house at IS Ellis street, yesterday
reported to the police that a Chinese ser
vant, who was employed by her, had
stolen $25 belonging to her son. The money
was under the pillow of a bed in which
her son slept.
Further argument on the application of
Abble Rose Wood for a family allowance
from the estate of the late Joseph M.
Wood was heard by Judge Troutt yester
day. Judge O. P. Evans, who represents
decedent's children, cited' authorities
which he contended supported his theory
that the marriage of the claimant and
Joseph M. Wood in Nevada was illegal.
Attorney Timothy J. Lyons, who repre
sents the claimant, will conclude the ar
gument on Tuesday.
Nevada Marriages in Issue.
To show that tha amount of the tax rate
should be fixed only after the full amount
of the assessment roll has been ascertain
ed and after the State rate has been lev
ied, instead of in June, as the charter
provides, McCarthy quotes other de
cisions.
If the tax levy contains an illegal item such
item will not invalidate the levy as to other
items if the levy la so made that the Illegal
Item may be separated from the other items
of the levy.
Supervisor McCarthy has been unearth
ing Supreme Court decisions in support of
his contention that the tax levy of $1 127
for municipal purposes should have been
re-enacted by the Board of Supervisors
last Monday. McCarthy claims that the
item of J2S0.000 in the budget to be raised
for^payment of interest and sinking funds
on 'the park panhandle and other bonds is
clearly illegal. The charter Itself pro
vides that no tax shall be levied except
for outstanding debts. These bonds, says
McCarthy, have not yet been issued and .a
taxpayer is at liberty to pay his taxes
under protest, which will involve the city
in endless litigation. On this subject a
Supreme Court decision entitled James de
Fremery et al vs. Alexander Austin says:
Contention That Last One
Was Illegal.
McCarthy Quotes Law in Support of
DECISIONS ON FIXING
MUNICIPAL TAX LEVY
E. S. Salomon brought the meeting to a
close with a few words, and three hearty
cheers were given for McKinley and
BoosevelL- .'V. ;
With McKinley's election the insurrec
tion in the Philippines will end. Bryan Is
the only tjope of the Filipinos, and with
his defeat will come their submission. If
voters be honest they will ask nothing
more than McKinley's letter of acceptance
to convince them that he deserves their
votes. In conclusion the speaker paid a
tribute to Congressman Kahn and urged
for him the votes of the audience.
Â¦In order to cloud the minds of voters the
Democrats have raised the cry of impe
rialism and militarism, but no one has
been deceived or will be. deceived by this
howl of false prohpets. Americans pos
sess too much intelligence, are too thor
oughly Informed on the progress of cur
rent affairs to heed what they know to be
notoriously . false. By no permission of
American voters, said the speaker, will
the Bryanites be allowed to talk them
selves into office. For in this campaign
the voters of the Union have a solemn
duty to perform. They are called upon to
continue in his high station a man who
has proved himself to be a worthy succes
sor of Abraham Lincoln. This man, Wil
liam McKinley, has undertaken a task
which means much to the American peo
ple and Americans in duty bound must
permit him to finish It.
Bryan, the speaker said, has forced
down the throats of his followers his
absurd ideas on silver and his constitu
ents-have tamely submitted to his com
mands. They protested against his ab
surdities, but his insistence forced their
obedience. In keeping with their policy
cry of calamity they welcome any disas
ter, commercial or Industrial, as a cam
paign weapon to be used for more than
it is worth and to encourage rather than
allay national or sectional unrest. In this
they prove themselves enemies of their
country and dangerous to its welfare.
Dr. Edward Markbreiter was then In
troduced and was received with cheers.
He ppoke at length, but so eloquent were
his words and convincing his arguments
that when he had finished his hearers
urged him to go on. On the Republican
side, he said, in this campaign are the
men who stand for prestige abroad and
prosperity at home; for peace, progress
and happiness at home and dignity
abroad- On the Democratic side are the
forces of disintegration, of dissolution, of
political disease and death. It is they
who are striving to pull down the national
structure, to destroy the place we have
won among the nations and bring dis
tress and commercial disaster to the peo
ple of the nation.
Congressman Kahn then reviewed the
leading issues of the campaign, enunciat
ing Republican beliefs In reference to
imperialism, militarism, monopolies and
trusts. "If the policy of the Republican
party means," he said, "that the United
States shall become a world power, then
in God's name let the United States be
come a power of the world."
Congressman Kahn quoted from Demo
cratic writers to prove that under the ad
ministration of Republicans misery an.l
want have given place to plenty and abun
dance. Wise tariff legislation has protect
ed the employer and employe alike. Fac
tories and mills, industries of all sorts
and conditions have been revived and re
established upon a healthy basis, which
every American citizen should strive to
susiain. The speaker predicted a splendid
victory for the Republican party, as he
believes that the good sense of voters
will inevitably prompt thern to cast their
votes for that party which means pros
perity.
With the advent of William McKirley.
he said, the nation has progressed within
and prospered without. Its people are
employed and contented, its name is re
spected abroad and its fame now among
the nations of the world is greater than
ever before in its history. Do the Ameri
can people wish a change to the dark
days of commercial and industrial de
gression? Most assuredly they do not.
Congressman" Julius Kahn was then In
troduced and was received most gener
ously. The audience arose to their feet
and cheered again and again. The Con
greEsman could have asked no more elo
quent proof of his popularity, and when
silence was restored he spoke logically,
interestingly and eloquently of the issues
of the campaign.
The very fact, said Congressman Kahn,
that so many men and women had assem
bled on such a night, oppressive in Its
heat, was a promise and a sign that the
German citizens of San Francisco are de
termined to labor for the principles which
mean prosperity for the country. The
speaker begged his hearers to look back
four years to the time when the Democ
racy was in power, when men were
crying in vain for work, when
Coxey's army was on the march,
and distress ruled the land. Then
came the victory of the Republican party
and the election of William McKInley.
Conditions changed: where the desolation
of idleness had been was the hive of In
dustry; where cries for work had been
heard was now the hum and happy mur
mur of busy workers.
llcan party, he declared, and It is the duty
of every citizen to Indorse the efforts and
sustain the measures of that party.
"We are naturally a conservative people,
he said, and we do not like unnecessary
changes. "We have a double reason,
therefore, to support the administration
of President McKInley. Not only this,
but as honest American citizens we are
bound to do all in our power to return
him to the Presidency. The Democrats
accuse us! the speaker said, of being
guilty of imperialism, militarism, monop
oly, fostering of trusts and even of the
bubonic plague. We will plead guilty of
everything which has been conducive of
the best interests of the American peo
ple, which has brought prosperity and
happiness. Of nothing else Is the Repub
lican party guilty. ""

The Frankfurt sailed for China from
Germany with 1400 troops on board. After
the soldiers had disembarked the trans
port started back for this port. She was
seventeen days out and arrived yester
day, resting at anchor off the Folsom
street wharf last night. On the last days
of the voyage rough weather was en
countered. The sailors labored hard to
keep the vessel right and when the Golden
Gate was sighted and land made the of
ficers showed their appreciation of the
men's services.
Beer flowed from keg and bottle. It
was an hour of jollification. Most of
the men remained sober, but a few of
them suffered from an overindulgence.
Five oilers became mutinous. They fought
and quarreled and attempts to pacify
them were met with violence. The of
ficers of the vessel tried to reason with
the men, but they refused to take any
orders 'or heed maritime discipline. One
of the men then made a vicious attack
upon the second engineer. Most of the
sailors were then called from the deck
and were ordered to subdue the mutinous
mob.
There was a rush down the companion
ways ajid the husky mariners fell upon
each man who was drunk and quarrel
some. The officers then gave the order
to place the oilers in irons. This Instruc
tion was carried out to the letter and the
five rebellious ones were carried down Into
the hold of the vessel.
The transport's officers then considered
sending for the local police and having
the men taken ashore. The men, how
ever, by this time had sobered consider
ably and expressed regret for their rash <
actions. It was finally decided to liber
ate them and pass the incident up to the
German Government for investigation.
The Frankfurt was formally chartered
by the German Government but a few
weeks ago. It was the original Intention
of the Government that she should ply
between Germany and China and carry
troops only, but these plans were altered
and when the vessel arrived in Chinese
waters she was ordered to San Francisco
for a cargo of horses. The transport
carries 102 men.
Officers of the Ship Liberate the Men,
Who Were I>runk, After a
Few Hours of Con
finement
Shortly after the German Government's
transport Frankfurt sailed Into the harbor
last night five men were placed In irons
for mutinous conduct. While in an in
toxicated condition they refused to take
orders from their superiors and one of
them made an attempt to assault U.
Chrlstek, the second engineer. The of
ficers of the vessel, after some delibera
tion, decided not to call upon the local
police for an adjustment of the difficulty
and the men were released, after they
had been several hours In confinement.
The matter will be reported to the Ger
man Government and the rebellious sail
ors punished In accordance with the Ger-
Oilers on German Vessel

Consensus of Opinion Is That Condi
tions Imposed on Valley Road
Are Favorable to Muni
pality and State.
A conference was held yesterday In the
Mayor's office for the purpose of consider
ing the proposed new lease of China
Basin to the San Francisco and Ban
Joaquln Valley Railway Company. Mayor
Phelan. his attorney, D. C. Murphy; Cap
tain A. H. Payson of the Valley road.
Colonel Mendell and A. B. Magrulre. Com
missioners of the Board of Public Works;
Assistant City Engineer Morser, Super
visors Dwyer, Connor, Curtis and Braun
hart were present at the conference. The
Governor and Mayor are members of the
Board jjf Harbor Commissioners, for pur
poses of leasing State property, and their
signatures are necessary to make the
lease valid. After a long discussion It
was decided that the conditions named ;
In the new lease were In every respect
more favorable to both the city and State
than the torms of the old lease, which the
company desires to surrender.
By the terms of the old lease the rail
road company is to expend $300,000 for
the construction of a seawall in front of
China Basin, the seawall then to revert
to the State after the State naÂ«l built the
seawall southerly C0O0 feet to the north
erly eid of China Basin and also 2300 feet
beyond China Basin. By the terms of
the new lease the State is to take the
outside portion of the company's seawall
for a distance of 100 ftet after it has com
pleted its own seawall, from Mission
street to China Basin . ji distance of 600Â«
feet. The net result will be that the Val
ley road, by getting one-half of the sea
wall, gets five acres more than by the old
lease. As an offset the State will not
have to build 2300 feet south of the basin,
at a cost of $250,000.
The lease was read by the Mayor, and,
as he regards its terms favorable to the
interests of city and State, he will
undoubtedly sign it. He directed Assist
ant City Engineer Morser to secure in
formation regarding the streets in the
vicinity of the basin, and after being en
lightened his Honor will meet with the
Haibor Commissioners, who have already
approved the lease, for the purpose of af
fixing the official signatures thereto.
Mayor Pbelan Calls Them
in Consultation on the
Subject.
