unwilling passenger. He . answered
Machado's cry and urged him to hang
on. â¢ Seated on a small trapeze, he could
hot draw Machado to him and he decide.!
that a descent must be made. Hoff had
intended to make a parachute Jump, but
} to have done so would have meant the

descend. Slowly it came down. To
Hoff it Ewmed a century, as he fearcl

r The balloon drifted to the southwest of
j the park half a mile and made its descent

When Machado touched earth again he
was In a state of total collapse, and
seemed more dead than alive. Hoff cut
tie rooes from around him and assisted
) him to his feet. He shortly recovered and
I was taken back to the park, where the
crowd deluged him with congratulations.
Machado could not explain how he came
to be caught In the ropes. He said he did
not relish his trip and .had had all the
ballooning he wanted. Hoff paid the ropes

aeronaut said the balloon had reached a
height of 1000 feet.

Machado realized the peril of his situa

was dark, but the people could discern
his form. As he was taken up a. cry of
horror went up from the crowd. Then.
as he was carried higher, the stillness of
death settled over the spectators as they
awaited the awful fate that they believed
roust surely befall the ur.fartunate man.
Machado. with a. couple of thousand

twenty-four, were Germans, who, either As
Republicans or. gold Democrats, opposed
Mr. Bryan's election four years ago. One
of them was an ex-Mayor of the city.
In Introducing his speech at Dayton Mr.
Bryan charged the Republican party with
using specious arguments -to catch par
ticular classes of voters. As to the claim
t'nat the Interests of the soldiers were
safer in the care of the Republican party
Mr. Bryan said:
"The soldier is In more danger if his
Interests are left, to men who stand at
the head of the great monopolies than he
Is If he leaves his Interests to those who
belong to the common pe'ople. I will go
further than that. I will say that the
welfare of the -Union soldier and his pen
sion are safer In the. hands of a Confed
erate soldier than in the hands of a great
monopoly, for the Confederate soldier
knows something about the sacrifices of
war, while the heads of syndicates only
know war as an opportunity for the ac
cumulation of great fortunes out of the
people's sufferings." ,
there was no physical clash. A majority
of the meetings during the day were not
so largely attended nor so demonstrative
as those of the Indiana and Illinois tour
of last week. Rain threatened during the
greater part of tho day and this circum
stance doubtless had a dampening Influ
ence on the ardor of the crowd?, as well
as upon their attendance.
When Mr. Bryan was Introduced at
Sprlnsrfleld. where he had one cf . the best
crowds cf the day, some enthusiastic ad
mirer In the crowd shouted, "Hurray for
the farmer President."
The exclamation attracted Mr. Bryan's
attention, and he said:
"I do not want to be elected under false
pretenses. I. am not a farmer: I am an
agriculturist. You know the difference be
tween them. A . farmer is a man who
makes his money on the farm and spends
It In town, while an agriculturist Is a man
who makes his money In town and spends
It on the farm."
...This definition pleased the audience, and
all , listened attentively to his speech
tnroughout. At this point Mr. Bryan de
voted his principal attention to the trus-ts
and his arguments wore along the usual
lines.
At Dayton the meeting was held at the
fair grounds and Mr. Bryan spoke from
an open stand on the race course.
Probably the most Interesting feature
of this' meeting was the fact that out of
a hundred vice presidents of the meeting
PORTSMOUTH, Ohio, Oct. 11-Mr.
Bryan concluded the first day of
his campaign in Ohio in this city
to-night. He was met at the sta
tion by a torchlight procession
consisting of men both on foot and horse
back, and was escorted to a square In the
center of the city, where he spoke from a
I latform in the open air. The meeting
was by far the largest of the day, and it
was thoroughly enthusiastic. The Re
publicans also had a torchlight procession
in the city to-night, with speeches in a
public hall by Senator Spconer and W. D.
Bynura. As a consequence the city was
full of red fire and political enthusiasm.

there are good corporations and bad corpora
tions and the difference between them can be
told as readily as the difference between two
wealthy private Individuals. As for.

monopolies are bad, he means that patent law*

EVAXSVILLE, Ind.. Oct. 12.âGov
ernor Roosevelt concluded his !
Indiana tour to-night, making
two speeches In this city, aui
speaking in both Instances to
large audiences. Arriving here at 4:30
o'clock the Governor dined in his private
car, remaining there until shortly befo'O
S o'clock, at which time he v.as eseortÂ«r1
to the St. George Hotel, where he re
viewed a parade given in his honor. From
the reviewing stand he was? driven " to
Evans Hall, Â¦where he made a reply to a
speech delivered yesterday by Mr.
Bryan. From the ha", he wont to the
Grand Opera-house and addressed thi
second audience, constituting the eleventh
which had heard him speak since he left
Indianapolis this morning. The day was
characterized by large crowds and much
enthusiasm, in which respect Evansyille
was not lacking.
In his speech at Vir.cennes Governor
Roosevelt delved into history to show
that through expansion that part of thcÂ»
State of Indiana In which Vincennes It
situated was added to the domain of this
Government.
Governor Roosevelt's address at Evans
ville follows:
Trsterdny at Nashville. Mich., Mr. nryan
propounded certain questions to the Republi
can party, as follows:
1. If a trust Is a gcod thing why did the
Republican platform denounce trusts?
A. The Republican "party denounced the
evils of trusts and pointed out the way thoÂ«e
evils could be controlled and minimized. Any
sensible man knows that thero may be evils
which need corrections, find yet that this may
not mean general and senseless destruction of
all corporations and the conditions of our
modern industrial development. /
2. (O) If the trusts are a bail thing, why
did the Republican administration allow more
trusts to be organized than during all pre
vious history of the country?
A- The Republican administration did net
allow more trusts to bÂ» organized than during
all previous history of the country. Incident
ally, the Standard Oil Company, the American
Sugar Reflnlng Company and all the other more
fore the present administration. But . Mr.
Bry&n knows perfectly well that the national
Government cannot prevent with Its present
powers the organization of these trusts and
that \t was the action of his own party asso
ciates in Congress on June 1 last, which pre
vented tne passage by Congress of a consti
tutional amendment which would have given
the national Governir.ent the power sought for.
3. (Q-) If some trust* are good and some
bad. can you tell the difference between" a
good one ar.d a bad one?
4. <Q.) Do >' ou know of anr cood monopoly In
private hands?
5. (Q-) Do you know of any man good enough
to stand at the head of a monopoly and de
termine the price of that which others are to
use?
Mr. Bryan yesterday attempted to answer
what I eaid about his attacks upon the United
States army. He says that . the President . in
his message â of December, 1SSS, asked ' for an
army of IW.QOO men two months before there
was any war in the Philippine Islands. He
asks: "Does Mr. Roosevelt know this?" Of
course I knÂ«w this, .and ; let f me_ also add that
Mr." Bryan ought to know, what every well-in-
A. We are not going to kill the Filipino un
til he tries- to* kill our soldiers, and heVill
stop trying to kill our soldiers very soon after
he becomes convinced that he will receive no
further aid from the party'or which Mr. Bryan
is chief. As to what we are going to do with
him. the answer Is slmi'le. We are going to
ci\-ilUo him and give him the peace, order and
Individual liberty and gradual increase of self
government of which Mr. Bryan would deprive
him for all time by turning him over, to a syn
dicate of corrupt Chinese half-breeds and fe
rocious Tagal bandits.
10. (Q.) What are you going to do with the
Filipino when you R2t him? Are you going to
kill him?
A. This has already been answered In my re
ply to No. S. Evidently Thomas Jefferson
thought that he could buy the right to govern
the Indians of the Louisiana purchase and An
drew Jack.*on thought we could similarly ac
quire the right to govern the Seminoles of
Florida.
A. There Is. of course, no title to the Fll
irino save as there Is a title to the inhab
itants of Alaska or of the Hawaiian Islands.
and he was not bought save exactly as dwell
ers in the Louisiana territory, including what
Is now Mr. Bryan's own State of Nebraska,
were bought by Thomas Jefferson. The Phil
ippine Islands were acquired . under President
McKinley by treaty and purchased exactly as
thÂ« Louisiana territory was acquired under
Jefferson, Florida under Monroe, and all the
rest of the territories which we have ac
quired.
9. (Q.) Do you think you can buy the right
to govern people?
The undoubted evils connected frith some par- '
tlal Industrial monopolies will never be af
fected in the least by .an opposition until In
dealing with them their opponents learn and
practice both precision of thought and pre
cision of statement.
6. (Q.) Do you know of any good reason why
tho crmy fhicld be made lOO.V'O?
A. Horn, Brain. * Mr. Brs-an's language Is
loose. If he i* spiking of the present, army

every man who pocsfSFes an ounce of common
wr.re or an ounce of patriotism must know

fusing to have It. It his boon nreilril In the

gress vntofl for It when it was provided for.
7. <Q.) "Would you b<? wllHr.K to make the
army &0,W) if the Republican loaders eall so,
or half a million If they wanted It?
A. It Ik hard to believe that this Question I*
put in good faith, for no one has dreamed of
asking for an army of 2K000 or half a mil
lion. Abraham I^tnroln once had to ask for a
larsre ariny. and In yplto of the opposition of
the politicians whose po!l*l?a! heir and as
signee Mr. Pryan Is, the pcople'gave him what
he asked. No lncrcar- of the army will Â»ver
be asked for by Republicans save because of
reasons which would ratlsfy the people as they
were" satisfied in the days of Lincoln.

ROOSEVELT REPLIES TO THE
QUESTIONS ASKED BY BRYAN
The Governor's troop arrived at Oneida
to-day, and Is still there. The horses are
quartered in the company's stables and
the men In small hotels at Sheppleton and
Derringer.
HAZLETON. Pa.. Oct. 11â The company
men employed at the Derringer colliery of
Coxe Brothers & Co. began this afternoon
to repair the breaker, which led the strik
ers to believe that an attempt was be
ing made to resume work. About 300 of
them from Sheppleton and Hopeville then
proceeded to the colliery. The foreman.
fearing trouble, telegraphed, for Sheriff
Harvey and his deputies, who were hur
ried to Derringer on a special train. In
the meantime the strikers learned that no
preparations were under way for a re
sumption of operations and the march was
abandoned. "When the Sheriff got to the
scene with his men everything was quiet
and the posse returned to the city.
Deputies Hurried to Scene.
The convention then went Into executive
session and so remained until adjourn
ment.
"This is probably one of the mest re
markable conventions that it has ever
been my good fortune to attend. Tou are
called here to rass judgment on a propo
sition never made to you. The operators
made no proposition to the miners. Tiiey
posted notices cf an advance in wa^es
over those formerly paid. It will now
become your duty to pass judgment as to
whether you Cesire to accept It or to ln
ftruct your officer? what you wish them
to do. As* I said before, every man hero
must feel that upon his shoulders rests a
terribl? responsibility. If you legislate
wisely you will have a bright future be
fore you: on the other hand, a mistake
made now may mean a continuation of
the conditions which have prevailed here
for many years. I hope that you men
will do your duty. No man wants to be
carried away with enthusiasm. Tou don't
want to vote nor speak on* any question
because It is popular to do so. You should
do what you believe to be right."
Then President Mitchell again addressed
the miners. In the course of his speech
,.e s^.ic.
"The cause cf the miners is the causa
of humanity. Whatever the decision
reached regarding the operators' offer tho
future must be brighter, better and mere
Just. Miners, their wives and children
and humanity will be the gainer. Kindly
convey to the assembled delegates the sin
c:r;st sympathy and co-operation of every
union member and officer of the American
Federotion cf Labor. "We all pray and,
work for your success."
Telegram From Gompars.
Presldert Mitchell read the following
telegram from Samuel Gompers. president
of the American Federation of Labor:
The first business of the afternoon ses
sion was the receiving of committee re
ports, a matter of routine.
During the rollcall upon the adoption of
the reports President Mitchell ruled that
in compliance with the promise made to
the non-union mine workers all unorgan
ized men on strike could be represented
in the convention. For Istance. if a union
; ha3 a membership cf 500 and there are 7Â»
men on strike at the colliery where the
union Is located, then It is entitled to
-seven votes Instead of five.

Ish you to consider seriously the course
you intend to pursue. The eyes of the
American people are centered on the city
of Scranton to-day, anxiously awaiting the
result of this convention. I do not wish
you to accept one cent less for your labor
than it is possible for you to secure.
I do not wish the ere^t organization
which has been built up among you to
be wrecked and ruined through any mis
take of mine or your*. If yon legislate
wisely and judiciously I can see a destiny
brighter and happier for you and for
those who will take your places when
you have passed away. I can see a fu
ture where the little boys will be In at
tendance at the school instead of wasting
their young lives away in the breakers,
helping to earn a livelihood for their par
ents. I can see a future where pleasant
homes and happy, smiling faces of the
wives and mothers will be in vivid con
trast with the conditions of to-day."
PRESIDENT JOHN MITCHELL.
OF THE UNITED MINE
WORKERS' VNION.
"Now, gentlemen, permit me to adman-
"For the first time In many year? the
operators have recognized your demands
for better conditions of employment and
have offered an advance cf 10 per cent
In your wages. I am well aware that this
advance is not satisfactory to you. You
have felt, and with Justice, that a definite
period of time should be named darlns
which this advance should remain in
force. Your experience where wages are
based on a sliding scale has been so un
satisfactory to you that you believe that
the sliding scale method of drawing wages
should be abolished. You al3o believe
that the laws of Pennsylvania should be
obeyed by the coal companies and wages
be paid twice each month, you reserving
the right of spending your earnings
wherever you choose.
"Whether it Is believed wise at this
time to insist upon a compliance with
all your demands Is a question which
you. as most Interested, are called upon
to decide. Personally. I have hoped we
should be able at this time to establish
the same method of adjusting wage dif
ferences as now exists In the' bituminous
coal regions, where .employers' and
miners' delegates meet in Joint interstate
convention and like prudent, sensible bus
iness men mutually agree upon a scale
of wages which remains In force for one
year, thus removing the causes of strikes
and" lockouts, and' even yet I believe that
in the future the anthracite operators will
accept thi3 humane and progressive meth
od of treating with their employes.
"Labor organizations, like labor-saving
machinery, are here to stay. Capital may
for a time refuse to deal with them; may.
of Its great power, retard the
growth of organizations for a tlms, but
like 'truth crushed to earth,' they 'will
rise again' and will give battle In defense
of the poor and oppressed.
1 Advance Not Satisfactory.
SCRANTON. Pa-, Oct. 12.â Eight
hundred and fifty-seven miners.
who hold In their hands the
power to end or to continue the
antharicte coal miners' strike.
â¢which has been In progress for mere than
three weeks, met in convention here to
day for the purpose of considering the W j
per cent net advance In wages offered by j
the operators and adjourned until to- j
morrow without taking any actici on |
their employers' proposition. Both of ;
to-day's sessions were devoted to organiz- |
ing the convention and to speeches by I
many of the delegates on the mine- j
owners' concession. It was not expectei j
that anything would be done to-day out
side of a general exchange of views. The
convention, after it was permanently
organized, went Into secret session, but -t
was learned from authoritative sources
that nothing of a definite nature wa3
suggested which would lead to a solution
of what is, to the miners, a knotty prob
lem.
From the trend of the remarks of the
delegates It was gathered that the 10 per
cent proposition, as it now stands, has
very little chance of being accepted. The !
delegates, it was learned, were almost
unanimous that the operators should first
make concessions In the other griev
ances before the increase is accepted by
the mlne-worker3. Great stress was laid
k i the necessity of abolishing the sliding
scale and substituting therefor a tonnage
basis on which to fix the rate of wages.
The preposition of hiving the' operator*
guarantee a fixed time for paying the ad
vance was also thoroughly discusseJ.
while not a few delegates said they would
be satisfied with nothing but a more
liberal increase In wages.
Procedure Is in Doubt.
The mode of procedure Is a matter
which is now occupying the attention of
the labor leaders. In Case the conven
tion comes to a definite understanding
on some proposition the question has been
asked how the operators will be advised,
in view of the fact that the latter have
repeatedly said they would not recognlzÂ»
the urion. President Mitchell will not
discuss that phase of the auestion and
none of the labor leaders will venture an
opinion.
That the present convention will not
come to a definite conclusion Is the gen
eral opinion to-night.' In the opinion of
several leaders the convention is, as at
present constituted, a little unwieldy.
There is a movement on foot to-day hav
ing fcr its object the submission of th
various propositions as they arc suggested
I by the delegates to a committee appointed
by the convention for consideration, thts
committee to report to either this cr a
second convention. This movement, how
ever, did riot gain much of a start.
Some of the delegates think that the
whole subject should be left in the hands
of the national officers as hinted by Pres
ident Mitchell In his brief remarks just
before the convention went Into secret
session. Mr. Mitchell Is very popular
among the miners, as was shown by the
enthusiasm displayed as he delivered his
opening address. In this address Mltcheti
reviewed the causes leading up to the
strike and concluded as follows:

to believe that Southern China Is now the

were first organized in the province of
Shantung and then extended their opera

es much difference between the northern

the French and the English. They speak
different tongues and one Is otherwise
foreign to the other.
"Up to the time I received my latest
advices from China, the Boxers had not
appeared in Southern China. It may be
that disturbances have taken place and I
would not be surprised to find, if they
have occurred, that local causes were re
sponsible. Perhaps two local clans have
engaged In hostilities, or perhaps the
people may have grown angry over some
local issue. It is possible, of course, that
if there, have been riots, they may have
been directed against missionaries but
we must ascertain in such event if the
missionaries gave the natives cause for
anger. The situation is so cloudy that
It is difficult for me to discuss it intelli

in her apartments at 122(f Wabash avenue
to-day with a bullet hole in her heart. On
the floor near her was a magnificently
chased duelling pistol, with which she had
shot herself.
Letters 'written by the dead woman

under the belief that her husband hTrd
committed suicide In New York, following
a. recent quarrel with his wife. ' Mrs.
Hardy had made v careful preparations for
her death, and even the letters she left to
her mother and others were written on
mourning paper.
Tho telegram which announced the
suicide of her husband in New York, and
which resulted in Mrs. Hardy's taking
her own life, was a bogus one. Hardy
appeared at the morgue to-day and ad

the telegram to be sent to his wife, who,
he understood, had secured warrants for

Hardy, dreading court proceedings,

that his wife, would take no further ac

KANSAS CITY, Oct. 12.-A shrewd at
tempt to rob the City National Bank of
Kansas City ar.d the Commercial Bank
of I^awson. Mo., of ?5500 was nipped in the
bud to-day, and as a result Harry Turner
and Robert O'Connor, telegraph oper
ators, both of Kansas City, are under ar
rest.
Ttirner and O'Connor went to Lawson
early this week and pretended to be look
ing for land. O'Connor, who wont under
the name of R. J. Reiff, bore a letter pur
porting to be from the Lombard Invest
ment Company of Kansas City and
gained some standing. Last night. It ap
pears, a telegram was sent to the Kansas
City bank signed "Commercial Bank,"
asking that $5500 in currency be sent bv
express to Lawson. The Kansas City bank
wired this morning that it had sent the
money, but the telegram never reached
the Lawson bank. Instead O'Connor pre
sented a telegram, apparently from the
City National Bank, ordering the Com
mercial bank to pay him the amount
stated. The bank officials, becoming sus
picious, telephoned Kansas City, and
O'Connor was placed under arrest iri the
bank while writing a draft. Later Tur
ner was taken in. Investigation devel
oped that the two men had telegraphic in

that they had sent the telegrams them

TEL, WASHINGTON, Oct. 12.â The re
ports from Tangiers that a Consul was
burned to death who presented the claim
of an American for indemnity is discred
ited.
The Information sought to he conveyed
was that French, Consul General Gum
mere at Tangiers had renewed our de
mand for Indemnity in the case of Marcus
Assagui, an American, who was burned
to death. The demand was made by the
French Consul, in compliance with State
Department orders sent him two weeks
ago.
An Investigation of the murder was
made in compliance with the request of
this Government by the French Consul at
F"ez. He reported that the horse which
Assagui, the murdered American, was
riding accidentally brushed against a
Moor. The latter assaulted Assagui, who
defended himself, but other Moors came
to the assistance of his assailant and As
fagui was vigorously beaten. He was
then tied to a pile of sticks, which were
saturated with coal oH, and fhe torch was
applied. The American was burned to
death. The department upon receiving
the facts immediately sent mail instruc
tions to the Consul General at Tanglcra
to demand an indemnity of $5000.

IS DISCREDITED

CHICAGO. Oct. 12.â No attempt will be
made to indict for the murder of Marie
Defenbach any of the- prisoners under ar
rest in the Insurance conspiracy case un
less much additional evidence is produced
before Grand Jury consideration is given
the matter. Officials of the State At
torney's' office belittle to-day the theory
that the woman was murdered and de
clared they would be party to no accusa
tion graver than the, conspiracy charge
as the case stands as present. The at
torney of the Mooney and Boland Detect
ive Agency has been so informed.
Investigations to-day resulted in show
ing nothing that would indicate foul play.
The analysis of the medicines found in
Miss Dcfenbach's room will not be ready

centered in the dregs found in the Schreu
der prescription, an overdose of which it
is thought may have caused the womdn's
death. Tho police authorities took cog
nizance of the most dramatic theory to
day in connection with the arrest of Act
ing Superintendent Brown of the Mooney
& Roland' secret service. The tneory has
a typical "Old Sleuth" setting and is to
the effect that Brown is in- jail as an
operative of the agency and with Smiiey
is seeking to unearth an insurance fraud
and murder conspiracy beside which the
Defenbach case is a lilliputian.
This suggestion is a most improbable
one on the face, but the authorities fail
to understand why Brown and Smiley are
so suspiciously intimate and friendly with
each other in view. of the fact that the

NEW YORK, Oct. 12.â Another dis

of Defaulter Schreiber to 5100,716. Sev
eral months ago an envelope containing
$3000 In United States bonds was placed

the envelope had been carefully slit open

The bank's attorney said the Institution
was responsible and the loss would be

that ex-President Kruger sailed from Lou

Dutch cruiser Gelderland.
The Paris correspondent of the Sun
learns from an excellent source that it is
absolutely untrue that the Government
will oppose the landing of ex-President
Kruger at Marseilles. The report circu
lated to that effect was the invention of
newspapers hostile to the Government.
Should Kruger decide to disembark at
Marseilles he will be received with the

the crime. Jail guards mark their long
conferences together. They are in the

are no other prisoners in the building on
such intimate terms.
Brown said to-day that Smiley was one
of the best fellows in the world. "Frank

one," said he. "Anything he says about
this case is true." Just then Smile:/
passed Brown in the, corridor and slapped
him on the shoulder.
"Making a confession. Brown," he said
with a laugh.
Captain Colleran says he does not be
lieve tho theory. "But Brown is a shrewd
fellow," he said, "and you can't tell."
Predictions were made to-day that there
would be another arrest in the case be
fore many hours. Another Mooney & Bo
land operative is said to be under sus
picion and efforts are being made to find
him. as he is not connected with the Chi
cago branch. The agency denies the story.
"I do not think the evidence thus far
secured justifies the arrest of any more
perrons, and In my opinion there will bo
no more arrests," said Captain Colleran.
All the missing women named in the
early sensational accounts of the case
have been found and all have proved in
nocence of any connection with the dead
woman or the persons under arrest. No
importance is attached to the discovery
in Brown's traveling bag of a vial of

are under construction.
Mr. Ziegier declares that no money will
be spared in properly equippinglthe ex
pedition, and says that if necessary
fl.OOO.OOO will be expended in order to in
sure the success of the expedition. He
says that this is a great patriotic under

NEW* YORK, Oct. 12.â George Y. Win
ner was the first witness called to-<Jay
before Commissioner Shields at the open-
Ing of the defense to the proceedings for
the removal of J. F.. E. H. and W. T.
Gaynor and D. D. Greene to Georgia.
Wisner is a civil engineer of Chicago. He
had examined the work done under Cap
tain Carter's supervision and testified as
an expert at the court-martial that the
work was well done and the cost reason
able. Under cross-examination to-day
Mr. Wisner. said he examined the work
done by the Atlantic Construction Com
pany at Cumberland Sound and Savannah
harbor under the contracts of 1S38 ana
found the work to conform with the
specifications of the contract. The .com
pletion of the contract was stopped when
Colonel Gillett took charge of the dis
trict.
For the first time since the proceed
ings began B. D. Greene and John l>.
Gaynor sat with their counsel and Cap
tain Greene frequently prompted the law
yers.
The EHstrict Attorney objected to most
of the questions and answers, but was
overruled on the ground that Captain Gil
lett had been asked exactly similar ques
tions when he testified for the Govern
ment.
Mr. Erwin asked "vVisner, on cross
examination, how much he was to revive
for his testimony. Counsel for the de
fense promptly objected.- Mr. Erwin
said quickly: -The question is material,
because it is but natural that a man's
testimony should be influenced by his in
terest in the matter under discussion. It
is an admitted precept in law that every
"man has his price."
"Not in the North." interrupted Mr.
KeHog of counsel for ihe defense. "Here
we have eome upright men."
Commissioner Shields ruled the question
improper.
The cross-examination of Mr. V/isner
was concluded and the hearing was ad
journed until Monday.

THEORIES ABOUT CATARRH.
Peculiar Ideas Regarding a Common
Disease.
Mark Twain's cure for a cold tn the
head was simple, but he claims very ef-
fective In his own case. His plan was to
eat nothing whatever for twenty-four
hoars or presumably until the trouble had
, disappeared.
Although not able to speak from per-
sonal experience as to the effectiveness of
this treatment. It certainly has the merit
of extreme economy; but It occurs to us
that the application of it to a case of
nasal catarrh might be attended with dif-
ficulties
Catarrh, as every one knows, is a
chronic cold In the head, and Mr. Twain"s
treatment, if It should become a fad.
would make of us a nation of I asters; an
army, emulating the example of the im-
mortal Tanner, who achieved world-wide
fame by fasting forty days.
Catarrh is certainly becoming: a national
disease, and there Is little doubt but that
errors in diet, particularly overeating, is
a very common cause.
Must people, however, are more inter-
ested in the cure of thÂ© trouble than in
the cause, and modern medical science
has produced more effective and less
heroic remedies than Mr. Twain's.
Guaiacol is. a new remedy, very effective
in some forms of catarrh. Eucalyptol la
another, which on account of Its anti-
septic properties Is very valuable, while
many severe cases of Chronic Catarrh
have been entirely cured by the sanguin-
aria or extract of blood root alone.
Within a year an enterprising chemht
has combined all of these remedies in
tablet form, palatable and convenient, and
the superiority of this tablet over other
catarrh remedies Is so apparent that all
druggists now carry them in stock to sun-
ply the popular demand.
They are called Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets, and It is doubtful If any medicine
has achieved a national popularity In so
short a time as this.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are used by
thousands of traveling men because they
can be carried in the pocket and used
any time and in any quantity, being free
from cocaine, opiate or any poisonous
They clear the head and throat from the
disgusting secretions of catarrh, very
often in a few hours' time.
For nasal catarrh they are far superior
to any wash, lotion or ointment, the use
of which Is often aa Inconvenient and an-
noying as the disease Itself.
For coucrhs. colds, bronchial catarrh and
catarrh of the stomach these tablets give
Immediate relief and a permanent cure
where lotions, douches and Inhalers make
no impression whatever.
Thi* preparation is a boon to catarrh
sufferers, and any druggist will tell you
that Stuart's Catarrh Tablets Is a remedy
that has come to stay. ...

INCIDENTS IN POLICE C0UET.
Evidence Taken at the -Preliminary
Examination of J. Snowgrass
Before Judge Fritz.
The preliminary examination of J. Snow
grass on the charge of assault with a
deadly weapon was commenced before
Judge Fritz yesterday. He was accused
of cutting Policeman F. C. Howard with
a knife. In Mrs. L. K. Skelton's saloon.
Central avenue and Sutter street.
Howard testified that defendant and his
friend, Charles Batterock, entered the sa
loon early in the morning while he was
standing at the bar. He had a drink with
them and they asked for a bed for the
night. Mrs. SKelton told them she had no
room, but they went to a lounse and bojh
fell asleep. Mrs. Skelton askea him to get
them out, as she wanted to close up the
place. She tried to do so herself, but
failed. He took hold of the defendant's
coat collar and roused him and the de
fendant struck at him. The defendant
and his friend went out, but the defendant
returned to the bar and showed fignt.
Ihey grappled with each other and tell.
After the defendant left Howard discov
ered he had been cut. He was corrobor
ated by Mrs. Skelton and other wit
nesses.
The defendant testified that Howard
struck him on the jaw to awaken him.
After he and his friend went outside he
returned with a hat," as he had taken the
wrong one. and Howard attacked him.
He had a knife In his hand and raised It
to protect himself and supposed that was
how Howard was cut. Later Howard re
marked that if he had known at the tims
he was cut he v.-ould have used hl3 re
volver. He was corroborated to some ex
tent by Batterock.
Judge Fritz apparently did not think the
case a stronp one. but reserved his deci
sion till Monday.
CUTTING OF OFFICER
HOWABD INVESTIGATED
MRS. MAUD M. NOLAN has
sued her husband. J. F. Nolan,
for an absolute divorce and a
division of the community prop
erty. Both parties to the suit
Â¦re very well known In this city. As M:?s
ilaud M. Treadwell the wife was iie:r*-ss
to a large fortune. The husband, Joe
Nolan, is vice president of the No'an Shoe
Coznpa&y, a young man. popular ar.d ex-
though they attempted reconciliation after
several quarrels.. Th^ir ch'ld. for whom
Loth had a dee? affection, was frequently
tmnely well liked by a large circle of
frier.ds. The Oivoree which was asked
yesterday by Ms wife -was not by any
means a surprise. It was threatened for
a lor.g time and the domestic troubles of
the ycur.g couple wore generally known.
Husband and wife could not agree, al-
as possible, but before the big wheels
ceased to revolve, however, the unfortu
nate girl's scalp had been frightfully lac
erated and her hair torn out by the roots.
Miss Lambert wore her hair loose while
at work and as the pulley shaft runs on
a level with her head It was an easy mat
ter for the accident to occur.
ment. As she passed near a shaft, over
which the belting rrom the engine
passes, her hair was caught and she wa3
dragged off her feet. The grirl's shrieks
alarmed her fellow employes and they
rushed to her assistance. Engineer Rob
ert Durst stopped the engine as quickly
MISS LAURA LAMBERT, resid
ing at 1314 Madison avenue, met
with a distressing and peculiar
accident in Haas' candy fac
tory. 810 Market street, where
she is employed as a chocolate dipper,
yesterday afternoon. The girl's hair be
came entangled in belting that run over
a pulley and before the machinery could
be stopped her scalp was nearly torn off.
She was at once removed to a private
sanitarium and every attention given
her. It Is not thought that her injuries
will prove fatal.
Miss Lambert is but 15 years of. age
and has been in the employ of George
Haas & Son for nearly six month. 1 ?. She
is a chocolate dipper and was considered
an expert at her trade. Yesterday after
noon Miss Lambert started to walk
through the engine-room of the establish-
| peacemaker In the disturbed household,
j but each succeeding quarrel widened the
i breach, until the inevitable came and the
suit for -divorce was Instituted. Mrs.
Nolan alleges Incompatibility and de
mar.ds a division of the community prop-
I erty.
( It Is over this demand that a stubborn
contest Is probable, as husband and wife
have very conflicting ideas of what this
community property is. Joe Nolan has
nothing to say in reference to his wife's
suit. Ke has been served with no papers
and has not seen the complaint, which, by
order of court, has been sealed. When
Maud Treadwell married Joe Nolan she
I assigned a large part of her property to
j her husband. She also made subsequent
! assignments, until her entire wealth had
been turned over to her husband.
She inherited from her father's estate
more than JITo.OOO. and received about $30.
000 more upon the death of her mother. It
is over this property at least, and prob
i ably more, that the contest will be made.
It is probable that the wife, in addition
' to a demand for a division of the com-
I munity property, will also file suit for a
; revocation of iLe assignments made dur
i ing her unhappy married life.
The suit, which has just been filed, re
! calls the marriage of Mrs. Nolan's sister
to James Swinnerton, the caricaturist.
I This alliance also was unhappy.
CHARTER IS NOT
RECOGNIZED BY
JUDGE CONLAN
He Ignores Section Protect
ing Defendants Prom
Attorneys.
A case showing that a Police Judge was
either Ignorant of one of the provisions
of the charter or knowingly violated it
came to light yesterday when Lottie Fos
ter, a woman of the tenderloin, made a
complaint at police headquarters that G.
W. Rose, an attorney, had obtained from
the property clerk $5 that belonged to her
and refused to deliver It to her.
The woman was arrested last week on
a charge of grand larceny for stealing $5
from a man. A $5 gold piece was found
on her and was booked as evidence. The
case was heard before Judge Conlan and
was dismissed, as there was no evidence
to show that the woman had stolen the
money. Ex-Judge Graham was engaged
to defend the woman, but he turned the
case over to Rose. Rose applied several
times to Property Clerk Esola for the $5,
but was unsuccessful In getting the
money*- Last Wednesday Rose, accompa
nied by Judge Conlan, called upon the
property clerk and produced an order,
signed by the Judge and written out by
himself, authorizing the property clerk to
deliver the $5 to Rose, and not wishing to
disobey an order of court Esola handed
the money to Rose and obtained his re
ceipt.
The Foster woman yesterday demanded
from Rose the return of the $5, after she
had ascertained that It had been delivered
to him. He lifted his cane and threatened
to strike her. Later they met In the Hall
of Justice, as she had been advised by the
police to se# Judge Conlan, and after they
had expressed their opinion of each other
in forcible language Rose handed her the
$5. She Intimated her intention of com
pelling him to deliver up $20 he kept from
bail money she had put up for a friend.
Captain Seymour was notified of the cir
cumstances, and he expressed his surprise
at the action of Judge Conlan and the
property clerk in view of the fact that
section 2 of chapter S of the charter had
been adopted speciallv to cover such
cases. The section reads as follows:
When property or money taken from any
person arrested or otherwise under suspicion
of having boen feloniously obtained or of be
ing the proceeds of crime is brought with the
claimant thereor belore a court tor examin
ation and adjudication, and the court shall
adjudge that the person arrested Is innocent
of the offense alleged and that the property
or money belongs to him. It shall order such
property or money returned to the accusej
and the property clerk shall thereupon deliver
Fuch property or rnoney to him personally, but
not to his attorney or agent.
Property Clerk Esola admitted that he
was not aware of the provisions of the
section, otherwise he would not have de
livered up the $5, even on Judge Conlan's
order.
OTder of Court Made Delivering
Money. to an Attorney Instead
of to the Person It Right
fully Belonged.

" I am so nervous ! no one ever suffered as I do ! There

NO CHANGE IN
THE POSITIONS
OF THE TEAMS
Following is the standing of the league
clubs:
A ladies'- challenge class has been de'fl
itely formed at the San Francisco Golf
Club, the qualifying round for admission
to its ranks having taken place last Sat
urday on the Presidio links. Aar Miss
Sarah Drum and Miss Hager tied with
scores of 142, these two ladies will have
to play a match to decide which of them
shall take seventh place and which eighth
in the class. The lady ranking eighth will
be open to challenge, by any lady In. the
club. It is certain that one of the ladles
at present in the class will be dispos
sessed when Miss Alice Hoffman returns
to the links, and it is highly probable
that several of them will be compelled
successively to yield her place. The la
dies will shortly get out a programme of
events for tho winter, Miss Hoffman being
the official handicapper. The green com
mittee will prepare a programme of
events for the men. At present the Pre
sidio courso is very hard, but as soon as
it has been softened by rain the work of
Improving it will begin. New teeing
grounds will be built and the putting
greens rolled and leveled.
Last Saturday the qualifying round for
the competition for the Captain's cup was
played on the links of the Oakland Golf
Club and to-day the cup contest will take
place over eighteen holes, medal play
Next Saturday there will be men's tour
somes, with handicap, for club members
match play, over eighteen, holes, for tro
phies.
Nothing has so far been heard of a
challenge from the Oakland Golf Club
to the San Francisco Golf Club for a team
match. But as the event has become an
annual one It Is presumed that the losers
of last year's series of matches will issue
a challenge, especially as a former United
States open champion, Herbert Rawllns
has been engaged 4 as instructor.
A busy golf season Is expected at Coro
nado during the coming winter Â»v*il

city. The crowds in the old Haight street
days were larger and the Interest in the
game just as Intense, but no such demon
stration and wild delirium of noise
reigned as an accompaniment to a dia
mond performance.
The game itself was not food for critical
enjoyment; Full of errors and wild inco
herenctes, it was anything but a scientific
â¢game. Both teams played nothing better
than rank baseball. It was the turn of
fortune, a lucky victory, when defeat in
big black letters was registered against
San Francisco that made the excitement
and took 9000 people clean out of their
minds.
Cut out the plangent accompaniment,
supplied by the spectators, and the last
game of the remarkable series between
Sacramento and San Francisco is not
worthy of a passing notice. The first two
games were. On Saturday twelve innings
of careful, scientific baseball were played,
the result being a tie. When two nines
play as long a game as this and but a
single error on each side is committed
then a scientific game is in order. And
Hughes, the great, was in the box for
Sacramento. He was hit,* and hit hard,
during the Saturday game. When called
Into the box. Sunday, ostensibly to save
the game, he was touched for three hits
in a single inning. It looks as If Hughes
were not the giant of other days. At any
rate he was found by the local swatters.
Fltzpatrick. who pitched tho morning
game at Oakland, was put in tho box
during the afternoon. This was a piece
of poor judgment on Harris* part and it
nearly cost him the game. 'Fitzpatrlck
, never could hold his head before a big
crowd, and the work in the- morning
weakened him considerably. The Oakland
game was the best, of the season from
the baseball view point. The score, 1â0
and one error are points to remember.
The same small gap separates the lead
ers and the same congestion exists be
tween Oakland and Stockton. The race
for leadership and the tair end position Is
equally hot.
On. Monday night Mrs. J. B. Muirhead,
widow of J. B. Muirhead, for many years
a member of the Ariel and Pluneer row
ing clubs, entertained the members of the
Pioneer senior barge crew, some private
friends and other guests at dinner. After
presenting each of the crew that won v the
senior barge championship at the annual
regatta on September 9 with gold buttons
as souvenirs, Mrs. Muirhead announced
that her husband had set asido a fund to
provide trophies annually for the oars
men. She also stated that a racing shell
brought out to this city for the use of
Stansbury, the sculling champion, but
which has never been pulled, and some
pairs of sculls will, be rallied, the proceeds
to be added to the fund already created.
Mrs. Muirhead left San Francisco for
Honolulu with the Mystic Shriners, but
will return in about three weeks. The
Pioneer crew sent her a fine basket of
flowers on her departure. On her return
the raffle, which is under the manage
ment of T. Sands, chairman of the regatta,
committee of the Pacific Association, will
take place. The first prize will be the
racing shell, a pair of sculls, the cover
and horses; second prize, a handsome
stop watch that has been used in timing
championship races In Eastern Canada,
British Columbia, Australia and Califor
nia; third prize, a pair of sculls used by
the champion, O'Connor.
. Though there is no regatta in sight for
some months, the rowing men are taking
advantage of the smooth water and clear,
warm days to spend most of Sunday
around the boathouses. The Ariel Rowing
Club is gaining new members constantly
and the project of erecting a new and
commodious boathouse is receiving mucn
attention.
Dr. C. C. Dennis of the South End Row-
In? Club thinks that for the purpose of
maintaining interest during the winter the
clubs on Long Wharf ought to hold
monthly barge races and skiff contests,
allowing the crews or scullers in the
heavier and slower boats a time handicap
based upon the speed of the craft.
Nothing further has been done with re
gard to the suggested amalgamation of
the Olympic and Triton boat clubs, which
at one time seemed somewhat probable.
The boats belonging to the Olympics,
which had been stored in the Triton boat
house, have now been taken back to the
Olympic quarters at Tlburnn. As the
Dolphin membership Is. full and the Tri
tons have the only other boat club on the
north side of the city a few new members
are joining the latter club. '
Oarsmen Will Soon Have
Fund for Prizes
and Rowing Trophies.

General Dickinson will be on the Point

ised at least fifty ducks.
The quail season opens in Marin County
on Monday and many of the shooters will
see what the fir,st days bring. H. C. Gol
cher will be among the first shooters. Re
ports bespeak a great number of quail in
the hills.
The big army of gunmen that left last
Saturday for a day's sport on the marshes
returnea a very disappointed band Sun
day night. Lucky \va3 he who had a
string of half a dozen birds. From the
present indications tho same conditions
Â¦will prevail this week.
A well known sportsman says it is al
ways thus.
"I have never seen an exception to it,"
he declares. "At the first of the season
the marshes are fairly covered with birds,
but after tho first shoot away they go
scampering: to far off climes. The winter
rains and the cold air are necessary to
bring the birds to the ponds. The fusil
lade given to the early birds last Monday
a week was enough to scare ducks away
for twenty years."
At the Field and Tule Club last Sunday
seven guns brought in eighty-two birds.
Colonel McMahon being high with twenty.
Al Cummings tried his luck on Wednes
day at the same place. He killed twenty.
H. B. Hosmer, Dr. Derby, E. W. Briggs,

day on the Cordelia -marshes.
. Aohille Roos is getting ready for a sea
son on the San Pablo Club ponds.
At the Pringle Club last Sunday the
high man shot four birds.
Disgruntled;, sick of mind and profane
of tongue are the duck shooters this week.
First of all, there never was such a bright
opening to the . season, which was on
Monday, October 1. That was an earnest,
they all\aid, of an unparalleled season.
Then came rains that started the ducks on
the wing and this was followed last week
by the hottest kind of weather, which
kept the birds high in the air and far
away from the shooting grounds.

RELIANCE and Stanford will meet
to-day on the Sixteenth and Fol
som street grounds In the first
college-athletic club, football
gamÂ© played this season on a lo
cal gridiron. Two weeks ago Reliance
played Stanford and was defeated by a
single goal. Last Saturday the same team
played a tie game with California. These
early successes have put ginger into the
clubmen, and they will play hard and
furiously this afternoon for the honors of
victory.
BERKELEY, Oct. 12.â Dissatisfied with
the poor showing of his patchwork eleven
last Saturday/ Coach Kelly has been
shifting his men around at a lively rate
during this week. With the exception of
the veteranB the rest of the team has re
ceived a thorough shaking up, especially
the backs and the left of the line. Most
of the positions still stand wide open, and
the problem who shall 1111 them is any
thing but easy. i.\..V : v
Nothing satisfactory has been developed
to satisfy the demands of the quarter
back question. More is poor at passing
the ball and McLain, though excelling
him in this particular, lacks too many of
the other qualifications for the place.
Coleman and Decoto are hard workers,
but have shown little brilliancy in their
play.
Left half and fullback seem hard to fill
without a Hall or a. Kaarsberg on the
Hold. Of the host of candidates Duden.
Sherman. Mini and Whipple have, a de
cided lead for the vacant half. Mini, the
little star discovered for last year's fresh
man team, has the making of a lirst-class
player if not handicapped by his lack of
weight. Whipple is larger than any of the
previbus threo and plays a dashing fight
ing game. His work, however, is too er
ratic and unreliable as yet.
Fautz has be-jn temporarily retired from
fullback and Braley is being tried In his
stead. Having speed, weight and withal
good punting ability, he should make a
notable fullback. His greatest failing is
a tendency to loaf. Between Fautz and
Braley clearly rests the fight for this
P With Womble. Pringlo and Smith
bunched on the right of the team this side
may be regarded as practically impregna

Left end is now held by Starr, the prom
ising freshman, -who has been forging
ahead of his rivals. He plays a cool.'
heady game, both on the defensive and of
fensive.
Left tackle -seems to rest between Al
bertson. Castlehun and Hansen. with the
chances still the better for the lirst man.
though Castlehun is giving him a hard
race.
Stowe Is being tried at center during
Cornish's sickness. He plays better here
than at tackle.
Clay easily holds left guard. He Is be
ing trained to play against Seeley of Stan
ford. Right guard is doubtful. Luce,
Dunbar, Overall and O'Toole are all like
ly men. Hector, a new man from the law
college, will come out in a day or two.
The list of freshmen eligible to play in
the football game against ' the Stanford
freshmen on October 27 contains forty
two men. It is as follows:

With the close of the fifth week of foot

When questioned as to his motives for
tho attack on Schmidt, Dugan denied hav
ing any knowledge of the affair, asserting
he never had a pistol. Dugan's sister died
about three months ago at St. Mary's
Hospital, and his mother is lying at the
point of death at her residence on Harri
son street. So much Illness and trouble.
It Is presumed, are the cause of his wild
actions.
â¢ Fearing he might carry out his threat
Schmidt gave him another drink. Dugan
then walked out. going to his home, where
he was arrested by Officers P. Butler and
M. P. Hurley. He was taken to the City
Hall station and booked on a charge of
assault to commit murder.
Hugh B. Dugan entered the grocery and
liquor store of W. F. C. Schmidt. STL First
street, yesterday afternoon, about 3
o'clock, and demanded of the clerk. John
W. Schmidt, a drink, saying he had no
money, but would pay for It Jater. His
demand was complied with after a. little
hesitation, but hardly had he taken the
liquor when he demanded another glass.
The second drink was refused him. He
then drew a revolver and fired directly at
Schmidt. Fortunately the latter turned
and the bullet burled itself in a cheese
on the counter. * It was a narrow escape
for the grocery clerk, as the bullet marked
the lower edge of his vest as It whizzed
by him. Dugan then commenced to use
foul language, threatening to kill any one
who refused him a drink.

disappeared from his home on Fifth street
late this afternoon. After a search lastinj

is little hope for hi? recovery. The wounds
were self-lntlicted.
Mr. Woods for a number of years has
been totally blind, and this infirmity,
added to a mental affliction which has re-
cently manifested Itself, led to the trag

LEXINXiTOX. Ky., Oct. 12.â Thomas
E. Keating, after a week of se
vere Illness, died here this morn-
Ing at 7:"0 o'clock. At the close
of the trotting, meeting this after
noon hundreds of horsemen assembled in
the judges' stand at the fair grounds to
hear a tribute to the dead turfman by
Colonel John R. Allen, me noted attorney
and member of the board of directors.
Colonel Allen said among other things:
Thomas Keating fought through life with all,
tb# energy given unto man and only pave up
the struggle !n death. In him the turf has
lest a clean, .honest man. No man can point
the flr.pr of Fhame at him as owner, trainer
or driver. When he had an entry in a race all
knew that bo far as his dictations went the
race would be an honest one. and when he
drove In a race all men knew they would get,
in the parlance of the track, "a. run for their
money."
Allen is a particularly effective speaker
and at the conclusion of his remarks
there was not a dry eye In all the throng
of stout-hearted horsemen.
The board of directors of the Trotting
Association aftfrward held a meeting in
Secretary Wilson's office, at which reso
lutions of respect were 'adopted.
Wh^n the announcement was received
in this city that "Tommy" Keating had
received the word from a higher judge
for the last time and had crossed the
line that leads to the great unknown a
feeling of gloom oppressed all lovers of
the harness horse that was hard to dis
pel. In his death California loses a man
who made the State famous the. world
over. As a driver he may have been sur
passfdj but a? a conditioner where judg
ment and patience were essential quan
tities he had no peer. Kind-hearted and
generous to a. fault, enemies he had none;
friend? he possessed Â£y the hundreds.
While California could not claim th?
dead roinsman as one of her sons, it was
!n this State he Ixjran ascending the lad
der of fame. Tom Keating was a native
cf Ohio, and had not reached the age
of 40. During his boyhood days he drifted
out to the State of Nevada, where for a
time he was an employe on a cattle
ranch. Later, finding his way to Sacra
mento. hÂ«t engaged in the grocery busi
ness. His innate love for the horse, how
ever, was not to be subdued, and some
ten or twelve yÂ«"-ars ago found him cross
ing the Rockies with Sensation and two
or three fithers. Returning to California,
Keating formed a partnership with A. Ot-
tinger, the firm of Ottingrer & Keating
being a power on the circuit.
Dissolving partnership with Ottlnger, it
remained for ISM to bring Increasing fame
to this dark-haired little man. In that
year he went East with a wonderful sta
ble of horses. At Peoria. KlRtawah the
three-year-old son of Steinway, thrice in
one raco, reduced the pacing record for a
horse of that age, taking a mark of 2:06^i.
Some months later the same pacer re
duced the record to 2:05i4. which still
stands. Searchlight, another member of
the string, returned to California with
the world's four-year-old record of 2:MV6-
Anaconda. the stable companion of
Searchlight, lowered the colors of Direct
ly. Chenalls and other fast ones at
Lexington, coming back to winter quar
ters with the world's record of 2:O4y; for
flvc-year-old pacing geldings. This same
season Keating handled Dione with rare
discretion, cutting the dapper mare's
work to 2:0Hi 'n a hard fought struggle
at Cleveland.
Probably no other reinsman living ever
met with the success Keating had train
ing and developing pacers. In his stable
at one time were Searchlight, 2:03U. cham
pion, three, four and five-year-old pacing
stallion: Anaconda. 2:02. champion four,
five and six-year-old pacing gelding, and
Coney, who later earned the flve-vear-old
pacing record for geldings, and" which
now holds the amateur driven record to
wagon.
When his health failed during the sea
son of 1S98 Myron E. McHenry was select
ed by Keating to do his driving. In June,
1^99. Keating passed through a hard siege
of sickness at Denver. Colo., his life at
one time being- despaired of. Traveling
farther East when convalescent, with re
turning health, the future looked brighter
and he signed a contract with the million
aire groceryman of New York. Thomas
Butter. The later turfman only recently
leased the magnificent Corbitt stock farm
at Uurlingame, where on.- of the grandest
establishments of its kind In the world
was to have been established, all under
the direction and supervision of Keating.
At the head of the stud were to have
been placed Direct. 2:05 1 i, and Gayton
2:0S.
At the time of his untimely demise the
deceased horseman's string consisted of
Bonnie Direct, 2:05V. ; Gayton, 2:03: Coney
2:02%;: Anaconda. 2:02;' Hetty G, 2:051/;
Cole Direct and Bon Marche. The horses
are probably now in Los Angeles, as they
had been ordered shipped to the Southern
metropolis to participate in the coming
meeting there.

CALIF0RNIANS IN WASHINGTON
FASHION HINT FROM PARIS.
The demand of every business and every industry
in the country is for a Republican House of Repre-
It can hardly be necessary to point out to the peo
ple of the Sixth District how important it is for them
to have a Representative in harmony with the admin
istration. The election of, McKinley is as sure as
anything in the future can be. The apathy prevailing
in the early days of the campaign has long since
passed away. . The people have become aroused by the
menace of Bryanism to all the industries of the coun
try and are now sufficiently aware of the danger that
lies in overconfidence. They are not going to take
chances. Consequently the only doubtful point in the
contest \s that of electing a House of Representatives
to support the President. In the present House the
Republican majority is small. The loss of a very few
seats will give the Democrats control of that impor
tant branch of the Government, and. the best efforts
of the administration would be- then hampered by
Democratic obstruction for two years.
It is time for the people of the various districts of
California to elect to Congress men of such standing
that their re-election will be well nigh assured, so that
in the end California will have a body of experienced
Representatives having a large acquaintance with
methods and the members of the House. Only by
having Representatives of that character can the State
attain to its rightful position in the Union. Mr. Mc-
Lachlan is a man of whom great things may be ex
pected in Congress. He possesses industry, fidelity to
duty, a high capacity for making and retaining friend
ships, and his devotion to Republican principles and
policies is unquestioned. The election of such a man
will be a benefit not to his district only but to the
State, and indeed to the whole Pacific Coast.
The opponent of Mr. McLachlan appears to have
abandoned the contest, having no stomach for leading
a forlorn hope. Republicans, however, should not put
too much trust in appearance?. Skillful campaigners
have been known to achieve victories over a too con
fident foe by making "a still hunt." There are a good
many Democrats in the Sixth District. They may be
so much opposed to Pryan that they feel no inclina
tion to make a vigorous campaign for him, and yet
they may endeavor to make up for the defeat of the
electoral ticket by voting solidly for their candidate
for Congress. Such a danger may be remote, and we
believe it to be so, but none the less it exists, and Re
publicans should be on guard against it.
THE CONTEST IN THE SIXTH.
1 I ROM all reports that come frorn the Sixth Con
1 gretsional District there appear to be no rea
sons for doubting the success of the Republican
ticket. Mr. James McLachlan of Pasadena, the nomi
nee of the party, is an exceptionally strong and popu
lar man. His nomination was given with enthusiasm
and has been. warmly approved by Republicans in all
parts of the district. He is so well known that he
needs no commendation to strengthen him with his
constituents. No man is better fitted by experience or
by natural ability to advance the interests, of the dis
trict in Congress or 10 maintain there all those mea
sures which are calculated- to benefit California.
i 3. Wo are honest, and are against all efforts at dis
honoring the nation by currency legislation or otherwise.
' 4. We are law-abiding, and are against all encourage
1 ment of force in the settlement of disputes.
! 5. We are progressive, and favor legitimate expan
] sion of our commerce and our power.
It will be seen that prosperity is having its # effect
everywhere. The figures of the Postoffice show what
! is going on in the country, and the letters of men like
Lawton show that even Democrats perceive the mean
ing of them. When people have letters to write and
j money orders to send or to receive, then times are
J good. Then people feel patriotism tnore than party
; spirit and are willing to break away from old ties and
take their stand with those who are upholding the in
1 dustries and the finances of the country at home, and
the flag and the national prestige abroad.
So marked has been the prosperity of all sections of
the Union that even in the Bourbon South there is a
strong sentiment against the Bryanites. It is to be
noted, moreover, that those who share that sentiment
are not at all backward about expressing it. For ex-*
ample, Alexander R. Lawton, one of the foremost
men of Georgia, recently announced a determination
to vote for McKinley. He added that many of his ac
quaintances intended to vote the same way, and in ex
planation of his course said:
"We shall vote for McKinley and Roosevelt because:
1. We are Americans, and are against all of America's
enemies.
2. We are patriotic, and are desirous of suppressing
thoso who give aid and comfort to our enemies.
The report is 01 course simply a statement of the
work of one of the great departments of the Govern
ment. It is not a campaign document. It was not
prepared for the purpose of influencing voters, and
yet in this contest for prosperity against the calamity
party it serves as an effective argument in support of
the present condition of things in all parts of the
country, and consequently is a campaign document
preaching in favor of the Republican party.
PROOFS FROM THE POSTOFFICE.
/
1 \EPORTS recently issued from the Postoffice
k-/ showing the business for the fiscal year ending
June 30 afford striking proofs of the prosperity
and business activity of the country. A summary of
the statistics given shows a wonderful increase in the
sales of postage stamps, a revenue of $98,000,000 f om
that source alone, an increase in the use of "special
request" envelopes, used almost exclusively by busi
ness men, of, more than 15 per cent, and a marvelous
increase in the money order business. In 1898-99
there were issued orders valued at $224,958,363. The
value of those issued in 1899-1900 was $255,670,027.
Hardly a newspaper in the Southern States oppose
what Mr. Bryan calls '"imperialism," and should
Bryan by any chance be elected the Southern people
who are represented by those papers would soon show
him who was in control of the apple-cart.
United States Senator Jones says that Bryan
doesn't need cither New York or Illinois in this cam
paign. The Senator has evidently received a straight
tip on how the elections will go in these States.

PERSONAL MENTION.
If Â«uch things he done in the green leaf, what will
be done in the dry? If such a farce be played while
the promises of reform arc still fresh in the public
mind, what will be attempted when the commissioners
have reason to believe thrir promises have been for
potten? The bubbles blown by the Phehnites are
bursting rapidly. Every expectation of the people
las been disappointed. The Board of Health neglects
to enforce sanitary laws in Chinatown, the Board of
Public Works does no work, the Board of Education
t>ee<!s close watching, and the Civil Service Commis
sion makes a mockery of its official duty and under a
prclrnrc of examination sets aside good men in the in
terest of the incompetent and the false.
From the course taken by the commission in thesi
cases it is evident the civil service system under th;
ndminiM ration of the present Commissioners is noth
ing bm a farce covered .by a veil of hypocrisy. U
nutters not how incompetent a candidate may It, nor
v.hat falre statements he may make, he will be certi
fied as eligible bythe commission if he have "a pull"
with the Phelanites. The examinations are worth
less. A candidate who has been awarded~a high place
may be found utterly incompetent a*, soon as he 13
put to work. If dismissed from one place he goes
back to the accommodating commission and gets cer
tified for another position. Such is the civil service
fystem th*t Phelan's hoard has imposed upon the city
at the outlet of administration under the new charter.
Here are ample evidences of the worthlessness of
the examinations made by the commission and of the
ir.differcnce of the commission to the rules governing
such r?:r.!r.ination$ as it holds. A man found to be
to incompetent that he could not hold his position as
an ordinary clerk for two days goes straight back to
the commission and gets his name placed among ths
first on the eligible ii>t for bookkeepers; another
man. competed of false Â«tate;ncntÂ«, is permitted to
retain his place on the eligible list, just as if he had
never Committed any offense at all.
The second case is that of a candidate who in taking
the examination made false statements concerning his
former occupation. The falseness of the statements
vis proven by tv.o witnesses and was afterward ad
rnitted by the candidate himself. The facts were ex
posed in a hearing before the commission, but never
;he!e5s the commission dismissed them as of no im
portance.
ONE by one Phelan's various boards have added
their contributions to the scandals of his ad
ministration. First the Board of Health
started a bubonic plague scare for the purpose of get
ting a big appropriation, the Board of Works fell into
disrepute by doing very little work for the size of the
sabry iist, the Bo?.rd of 'Education started upon a
career injurious to the schools and was stopped only
by the indignant protests of The Call, backed up by
the great body of citizens, and now comes evidence
showing that the Civil Service Commission has been
baking a farce of the whole civil service system.
Records cf recent proceedings of the commission
published yesterday thow two serious scandals and
justify a suspicion that many more would come to
iight if all the records were known. In one case a
candidate who had passed a successful examination
before the board for the position of ordinary clerk,
and had received a certificate, .vas appointed to a po
sition in the Registrar's ottice. He held the place but
two days, being then dismissed on the ground of in
competency. The same man went before the examin
er* once more and was again successful, being
swarded 81.5 per cent and placed fourth on the list of
those ciicible for bookkeepers in the SherifFs office.
- a farce of it.
The Democratic flag-furling papers. If they were wise, would shut out
Valentine from their columns. He is a man of no consequence at all on this
Issue, though he may he skilled in his own particular field as an official of a
great distribution agency. He is out of harmony with the great mass of the
intelligent people of his section and of his party. His word on the outlook In
the express business in the West would be entitled to some consideration, but
on the question of "imperialism" he speaks with no authority. The thing
which he champions has never been American policy. Nearly all the coun
try's greatest statesmen, except in the abnormal situation created by slavery
half a century ago, favored expansion. Valentine's own party was enthusi
astically devoted to expansion even then, and wanted to seize Cuba and parts
of Central America. In his present role of anti-Democrat and anti-American
Valentine is absurd.â St. Louis Globe-Democrat.
If Valentine was a reader of the Democratic newspapers of the West an'd
the South he would know that the "wholte organized power of the Democracy"
Is not in the flght against what he caJls the "Imperialistic programme." Bry
an's views In favor of flag-furling are ridiculed by nearly all the leading
Southern papers of his party â the Louisville Courier-Journal, the NashviUs
American, the Atlanta Constitution, the Chattanooga Timea, the Memphis
Commercial-Appeal and very nearly all the rest of the influential Democratic
papers of their section. The same Is true of the conspicuous Democratic pa
pers of the West. What Valentine styles "imperialism" Is as strong among
Western and Southern Democrats as it Is among Republicans. Nine out of
every ten persons whom Valentine meets on the streets of San Francisco are
"Imperialists."
The Democratic papers are giving considerable apace to the ravinps of
Valentine, the head of the Wells-Fargo Express Company, \rhoÂ«<? headquar
ters are In California. Valentine declares that "Bryan has ranged himself
and the great party behind him on the right sfde. He throws the whole or
ganized power of the Democracy into the fight against the Imperialistic pro
gramme." "Eighteen months ago," he adds, "I believed Democracy would
triumph, and now I heartily hope so," which means that he is not quite so
confident as he was eighteen months ago that the Democracy would win.
THE POLITICAL RAVINGS
OF WAR-TAX VALENTINE
BY reason of her unrivaled rush around the Horn 1
to join in the battle against the Spanish fleet
in the West Indies the Oregon will continue to
hold the proud title of "Peerless." Had it not been
for the glory of that great feat she would now be in
danger of having to surrender the title to a sister
battleship, the Wisconsin.
The newcomer is another illustration of the ability
of our ship-builders to triumph over all competitors
in their line of work. From the tests made in the trial
â¢trip of the Wisconsin on Thursday it appears she is
the fleetest battleship of the world. The Oregon was
great, but the Wisconsin is greater.
â¢ It is of course to be expected that as we advance
in the work of building up our navy the new ships
will show improvements over their predecessors of the
same class. It was not to be expected, however, that
the improvement would be steady and continuous with
each successive ship. Such, however, seems to have
been the case, with but two exceptions. The Indiana
made her trial trip October 18. 1895, and showed an
average speed "of 15.547. The Massachusetts, tested
April 25. 1806, surpassed the, Indiana. Then came thj
Oregon beating the Massachusetts. The Iowa sur
passed the record of the Oregon. The Kearsarge and
the Kentucky failed to keep up to the standard, bur
the Alabama once more raised the speed limit, at
taining an average of 17.013, and now comes the Wis
consin and surpasses that by a trial run showing an
average speed of 17.25.
It is not in speed qualifications only that the new
ship excells. In all the evolutions of turning, backing,
going full speed ahead or full speed astern, she was
found to be equally fitted for the work expected of
her. Mr. Scott is reported to have said: "Without a
doubt she is the most perfect ship in all appurtenances
that the Union Iron Works has ever turned out." It
appears he might have added further that no other
yard ever turned out her equal as a fighting ship. She
stands first in her class and has no superior on the
seas.
Where such a triumph has been achieved it seems
hardly worth while to count chickens as yet un
hatched, but none the less the navy of the United
States is not yet completed. Our shipyards will yet
have an opportunity to surpass the Wisconsin, and
consequently from what has been done the thoughts
of the people will naturally run forward to the future.
We welcome the Wisconsin and we glory in her suc
cess, but we wait the coming of another and a greater
ship from the Union Iron Works bearing the name
of California. May it not be long before we see her.
THE WONDERFUL WISCONSIN.
The Board of Education, after the lashing of pub
lic censure and an investigation of municipal offi
cials, has abolished its department of repairs. This
abolition does not destroy, however, the record of
thousands of dollars of public money spent without
warrant of law or soften the excuse of illegal acts
committed under the board's plea of ignorance.

getting higher prices for her cotton than
she has received for years. The Bryan
prophecies have failed in every part or the
country.
CHARLESTON NEWS ANT> -COUR
IERâ"The little colleges" have made the
country what It Is. in literature and law
and government. This is natural, in view
of the fact that the little colleges are at
tended In the main by those who go there
to learn and make the best of their oppor
tunities, and that they have done this the
history of this country shows.
MINNEAPOLIS JOURNALâ We have
always made it a point to let the public
who could not hear Mr. Bryan read what
he had to say. He talks so extravasrantly
that deliberate, sober reading- of what he
says, uninfluenced by the accompanying
tricks of his oratory and the magnetism
of his personal presence, gives a clearer
idea of the value of his utterances.
NEW YORK POSTâ The refusal of the
United States to accede to Germany's de
mand gave Lord Salisbury what he most
neededâ time to suggest compromises and
alternative plans' for reaching a basis of
peace. The result has been the construc
tion of a ladddr by which the Kaiser can
come down, one step at a time, from the
high and dangerous position he had taken.
NEW YORK EVENING SUNâ The Sul
tan is accustomed to Ignoring threats and
he has got to learn to look out when he
treads on American toes. By this time he
probably feels that it is time to change
his tactics. We won't have to bombard
one of his seaports. He will give way and
pay up. And the Turkish will be added to
the Chinese affair as an additional feather
in the cap of our administration.
NEW YORK STAATS ZEITUNO. -
No man has yet been elected President
because he possessed, striking, brilliant
Qualities. The people demand rightly that
the candidate shall have certain sterling
traits of character and a solid element
of conservatism in him, so lhat one can
look to hi3 administration with confidence
and, above all. with cairn security.
NEW YORK PRESS.â If the -man who
insisted on the readoption at Kansas City
of this declaration of party faith he elect
ed President the Civil Service Reform As
sociation will ceese to worry about such
little things as the annulment of portions
of State laws by State courts. It will see
the principle for which It stands become
as completely a lost cause as that of the
Southern Confederacv.
BOSTON TRANSCRIPTâ The attitude
of our Government is distinctly American
now. as it has been from the start. It is
an all-sufficient answer to the campaign
clamor of a certain element of the oppo
sition that we had embarked on a policy
of adventure and that our co-operation In
the advance on Peking covered a scheme
of "imperialism." It will make for the
success of the administration at the polls,
and it ought to.
NEW YORK COMMERCIAL. ADVER
TISERâNo man whose candidacy is a
recognized threat to the business stability
of the country has ever been elected to
the Presidency of the United States, or
ever can be. No other candidate has em
bodied such a threat to anything like the
extent that Bryan does, and his defeat
should be made so overwhelming that he
and his kind will be excluded forever
hereafter from the field of candidates.
ST. LOUIS GLOBE-DEMOCRAT.â Not
withstanding the few small wars which
have occurred in recent years, some of
which are still technicaJly under way,
there has been a decided advance toward
a peaceful settlement of International
disputes among the great nations of our
day and the United States has taken a
prominent and emphatically creditable
part in bringing: this improvement In con
ditions about.
PHILADELPHIA LEDGERâ Governor
Roosevelt was wholly right when he said
that we "cannot do everything at once."
The Democrats are disobeying the consti
tution of the United States in disfranchis
ing citizens, and an Important and dlffl-i
cult work must be done right here at
home to right ?he wrongs and to remedy
the existing evils at home. This work
must be done by the great Republican
party, which is positively the only agency
now competent to do it.
CHICAGO INTER OCEAN.â If we pre
vent Great Britain from doing- in ihe Pa
cific what she has done in the Atlantic
the dream of William H. Seward will be
realized and the Pacific Ocean will be a
great American lake. But If wise legis
lation for' the Improvement of our mer
chant marine is defeated, as it has been
year after year in Congress, then the Pa
cific will be surrendered, as was the At
lontic, to our great commercial rival

sentatives. The interests of labor and of capital alike
require such a House. In each Congressional district
the people should be as vigorous in supporting the
candidate for Congress as in supporting the electoral
ticket. California is counted on in the East to send a
solid delegation to maintain sound money and pros
perity. The voters of the Sixth District must do their
share. Never mind whether the Democratic candi
date make an open fight or not. No Republican
should neglect the Congressional ticket. Let there be
a full vote for McLachlan and prosperity.
Similar quotations from eminent men of all sections
of the country could be given in large numbers. In
fact. The Call has published them day after day. It
will therefore be perceived that the banner raised op
posite Bryan's banner on Broadway is significant of
the vital issue of the campaign. His own words con
demn him. He has warned no gold standard man to
vote for him, and none should do so.
That the people of the country understand the
Falseness of the anti-imperial campaign is made evi
dent by the firmness of the gold Democrats in re
fusing to accept Bryan as a leader this year any more
than in the campaign of 1896. There was recently or
ganized in New York an association known as "The
Lawyers' Sound Money Campaign Club." with thÂ»
Hon. John G. Carlisle as president. This organiza
tion, presided over by one of the foremost Democrats
of the country, declares the preservation of the finan
cial integrity of the nation to be the chief issue of the
contest, denounces "the revolutionary doctrines" of
Bryanism, and declares: "That in our opinion the
defeat of Messrs. Bryan and Stevenson is essential to
the permanent and efficient maintenance of the gold
standard of value in this country-"
Further illustrations of the way in which conserva
tive people view the contest can be found on all sides.
Thus August Blum, a well-known banker of Chicago,
who had been a Democrat for years until the rise of
Bryanism, recently said: "There is one thing in
which we are all vitally concerned, and that is the
inviolability of the country's standard of value. For
a quarter of a century we have battled for it. At the
last moment to surrender to the enemy would be the
height of folly. I know of no other issue comparable
to this one in importance. Talk of imperialism is dis
ingenuous. Much as we may differ about the desira
bility of the Philippines as a colony, we occupy them
now. and largely through the help of Mr. Bryan. The
thing is done. Political programmes should never be
retrospective. The heart of the Democratic party i.5
not with Mr. Bryan in his artificial issut. What Mr.
Brj-an himself, if elected, would do about the Philip
pines is too vague and illogical to seriously consider."
The insincerity and falseness of the Rryanite cam
paign is shown by the two banners. The one ex
hibits his effort to excite a new issue among the peo
ple and to deceive them into a belief that he has
abandoned his crusade for the free coinage of silver.
The other sets forth clearly the intent of Bryan to
degrade the currency. It shows his defiance of the
honest money men of the country in 1896 "and his
assertion this year that upon the silver issue the Dem
ocratic party stands where it did four years ago.
"The party stands where it did in 1896 on the
money question." â William Jennings Bryan, Zanes
ville. Ohio, September 4, 1900.
"If there is any one who believes the gold
standard is a g-ood thing, or that it must be main
tained, I warn him not to cast his vote for me,
because I promise him it will not be maintained
in this country longer than I am able to get
rid of it."â William Jennings Bryan. Knoxville,
Tenn., September 16, 1896.
In preparing their banner the Republicans, placed
upon it neither portraits of the Republican candidates
nor quotations from Republican platforms or Repub
lican speeches. All that it shows are these words:
ACROSS Broadway, New York, at the head of
Wall street," the Bryanites early in the cam
paign stretched a banner containing portraits
of Bryan and Stevenson and quotations relating to
imperialism from Bryan's speech of acceptance. For
a long time the banner had that portion of the street
to itself, but recently the Republicans have raised a
banner near it, and in doing so have managed to get
in one of the neatest blows at Bryanism that has been
delivered during *he campaign.
A SIGNIFICANT BANNER.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1900.
âFrom the St. Paul Pioneer Press

Just a glimpse of a few
good things you will get In
k next Sunday's Call.
Something for everybody.
What Grace Pern has to say
about the resignation of the
Bev. Samuel Slocombe and the
churches of San Francisco will
appeal to all.
For those who would get
rich fastâ read of the fortunes
in oil made from almost noth-
ing.
For the lovers of art and
musicâ the Call advocates a
National Conservatory and
Bose Belda" tells why we
should have one.
For those who enjoy tales
of adventure and weird
stories â read about the fierce
Macabebe scouts, the haunt-
ed house in San Rafael, the
terrible "Secret of Mont-
mere," and Don Juan Gomez's
account of the most notorious
of California brigands Mu-
rieta and Vasquez.
If you are interested in gi-
gantic industries don't miss
the article on the building and
handling of log rafts on the
vast Pacific
If you prefer a paper on
affairs foreignâ peruse Gene-
vieve Green's excellent article
on "An American Duchess."
The housekeeper who would
please the palate andsat the
same time save her pocket-
book, will do well to consult
the page on dainty dishes.
If you have ever seen an
Indian you will appreciate the
best photographs of that kind
in this edition which have
ever been published.
If you'want to laughâ look
out for the comic section-
funny jokes and funnier pic-
tures.
And do not forget that Ed
JBorein, the "Cow Puncher
Artist," has a full page of his
best work.
Can you play the piano? Of
course â well, just try. the
march that goes with next
Sunday's Call. The latest out
and the best.
Can any paper in the United
Statesâ or for that matter in
the worldâ give you as much,
as this? Well, hardly.

McCORMICK RETURNS
FROM HIS EASTERN TRIP
was the subject of the lecture of Charles
Mills Gfjyley of the University of Califor
nia to the Channlngr Auxiliary yesterday
afternoon at the First Unitarian Church.
"It Is no vest pocket subject," he said.
"In greneral there, are three methods , of
estimating poetry. Does a poet's work
prove popular and does he appeal to the
masses? Does his work become well
known in Kntrlund or all owr the world?
Does his work live for centuries? That Is
the way to gauge a poet. Not until Pope
and Theobald entered into a controversy
did Shakespeare become famous. The de
cision of the masses is what decides the
real merits of a poet's work. Our fathers
read Byron, and I predict that before long
he will again be popular, as he was ro
mantic, and this is certainly a. romantic
ape. In the history of nearly all poets
there Is a critical reaction. We ".annot
tell about Kipllnir. We must wait to Â»Â»e If
there iÂ» a steady appreciation of his work.
Browning is a great poet, and he will not
be appreciated until the world is better
educated. The poet must work rationally
or otherwise his work will be condemned
as esthetic."

A daring burglary was committed at
432 California street last Friday night. A
new building is going up on the comer
ot Montgomery and California streets
and in consequence all the back part of
the saloon kept by Rusconi and Fisher is
easily accessible.
An entrance was forced through the
rear window and a general haul made.
Out of the cash register the thieves got
$15. Out of the nlckel-in-the-slot machine
they got about $10 more. Then they took
away about 500 cigars, a case of cham
pagne and a case of whisky.
The burglars smashed the cash register
lo order to get the money, and pried the
nickel-ln-the-slot machine open with a
Jimmy. When they departed they left be
hind them half a dozen empty champagne
bottles, so they must have ha/i a right
royal time of it. The police are working
on the case.

laurels were won." Explain, amplify and j
illustrate this statement of Colonel His- |
einson with respect to Holmes.
5. I>r. Hale says that Lowell called Em- I
erson "the Yankee Plato." and Holmes i
called him "the Buddha of the west." Ex
plain and illustrate the appropriateness
of these descriptions. Dr. Hale himself
says of Emerson that he possessed char
acteristics that were "more of Socrates :
than Plato." and which "we look for in !
vain in the traditions of Buddha." Ex- j
plain and illustrate also the appropriate
ness of these statements.

what busies Emerson, from fir3t
to last."
(b) "Sprunfr from the people, Whlttler
was emphatically a poet of the
people."

Krr.ersor; and Whlttier respectively.

11. Enumerate the mere important of thÂ«
statements of the earlier biographers of
Poe respeetlnp his life and character
which formerly were currently believed,

Tho body of an unknown man was
found yesterday in the bay near Webster
street wharf by Joseph F; Patrlclo of 161S
Lombard street. The pockets of the dead
man were filled with stones. The body
had been In the water about a month and
the features werx; unrecognizable. He
was 5 feet 11 inches tall, 60 or 70 years
old, dark and gray hair and a long
gray goatee. Tho clothing was a brown
sack coat, licht plaid vest, brown trou
sers, brogans well worn and gray cotton
underwear.
Unknown Suicide in the Bay.
Never in the history of the port has
there been a prpttior picture than the de
garture of the Zealar.dia with the Mystic
hrlners last Thursday. The big steamer
was loaded "just right." and not a long
shoreman but what said as she parsed
along the water front. "There goes a ves
sel loaded for any kind of weather." The
Zealandia was 24 feet aft and 16 feet for
ward, and if the Shriners do not have a
weathrrly trip it will be the fault of old
Neptune.
Captain McCullough of the pilot service,
who took the Zealandia . out, says all
hands were making good weather of it
except Andy Houselman. and when last
s*>en he was vowing vengeance on Ix>u
AznÂ»Â»r. Lou gave Andy a remedy for sea
sickness that failed to connect.
Made a Pretty Picture.
De Cleer Says His, Bride Celebrated
Marriage by Big Spree.
Frank de Cleer is a tailor, living at 522
Pine street. On May 7 Frank became fas
cinated with May Jones and married her.
May wsis a habitue of the saloon kept by
Frank's son at 622H Pine street. May got
drunk on her wedding night. In fact, she
got drunk every night thereafter until
June 26. when she landed in the Harbor
Hospital. At least that is the complaint
made by Mr. de Cleer, and the books of
tho hospital bear him out as far as the
morning of June 26 is concerned. At 2:13
a. m. of that day Mrs. de Cleer was found
on the sidewalk of Battery street by Offi
cer Graham and taken to the hospital.
Dr?. Robinson and Bauer took care of her
and about twf lve hours later she was able
to go home. Now De Cl^er has begun
divorce proceedings, and the two doctors,
the matron (Miss Brown) and Officer Gra
ham have been subpenned as witnesses.
WATER FRONT ROMANCE.
will sail in thousands. Many of
the horses are bound for China, but the
majority of the animals and the men will
go to the Philippines to aid In putting
down the insurrection in the islands.
The German transport Bosnia, got away
last night. She had aboard over 700 ani
mals and forage for them to last six
months. Every one of the horses had
been broken prior to, shipment and is sup
posed to be ready for service on his ar
rival in China. The German cavalrymen,
however, are not American rough riders,
and the chances are that there will be
some fun when the German soldiers at
tempt to mount a horse "broken" on the
water front or in South San Francisco.
Every horse is a perfect animal as far as
conformation goes, but a harder kicking
set it would be hard to find. In conse
ouence half a dozen men were taken to
trie Harbor Hospital for treatment before
the lot was g-ot aboard the transport.
From here the Bosnia goes to Nagasaki,
and thence to Taku.
From the German transport dock to the
"Wyefleld was only a block. At tho latter
place Uncle Sam was loading horses,
mules and provender for Manila, while
on the Conotnaugh across the dock every
thing- was bc-ing Rot ready for another
consignment of quadrupeds.
At Folsom-street wharf the Grant is
bring put in first-class order for the
transportation of troops, while the Sheri
dan is nearing completion and will get
away about November 1 with 1000 recruits
for the army in the Philippines.
THERE will be a big movement
among the'i transport fleet next
week. Horses and mules will
leave by the hundred and troops

His Action in the Train
Robber's TriaL
TUCSON*; Ariz.. Oct. 12.âThe Jury In the
cai;e of "Bob" Brown, a member of the
Fairbank train robbers, failed to agree.
After being out fifty hours It was called
to the courtroom by Judge Davia and
asked how it stood. When the court
learned that eleven were for conviction
and one for acquittal he asked the fore
man to give the name of the man who
held out. The Judge asked the Juror to
ptand, and then instructed the United
States Marshal to see that he never got
on a United States Jury again.
:ThÂ« act is generally "applauded, as it Is
a notorious fact that train robbers and
murderers are hard to convict in this Ter
ritory. The case will be retried to-morrow.

seat a letter to the young lady, saying
that rather than eee them married he
would kill them both. A second letter

indicated that the young man had decided
to carry out his threats and had come to
this city for that purpose. He declared
that he had come to Fresno with well-
Eharpened weapons and would do nothing
by halves.
This letter frightened Miss Ford and
she consulted with Harris, with the re

It seems that, according to the present
charter of the city of Vallejo, an action
of the City Board of Trustees entailing
an expenditure of over $200 must be ad
vertised at least five days prior to iu
going Into effect. The Board of Trustees
in the case of the police department failed
to advertise the requisite five days, some
claiming that that department, being pro
vided for in the charter proper, needed
no such action on the part of the board.
The charter seems vague and unexplana
tory in regard to tho police force, merely
statins tha.t Tour police officers shall be
appointed, one of whom shall act as chief.
The board appointed and administered
the oath of office to the entire police force
in one evening. Later, seeing that it had
acted unlawfully in that it had appointed
the police force before the act had been
signed by the Mayor, it reappolnted the
officers, but failed to advertise as pro
vided by the charter. This is the point
which Grove L. Johnson brought' up in
his argument and this is the point which
Judge Genty sustained In his decision that
Acock was net guilty of assaulting an
officer.
VALLEJO. Oct. 12.â The decision of
Judge Genty in the case of Chief of Police
Stanford vb. W. R. Acock, in which he
holds that Acock was not guilty of as
saulting an officer when he attacked
Chief Stanford on the night of Septem
ber 13, places the police force of Vallejo
in a peculiar position and practically
means that, according to law, there is no
police force at all in Vallejo. Acock, it
Is said, has at different times claimed that
he would attack the legality of the police
force when the time came, and at one time
told Stanford that if he entered his place
he did it at his peril, claiming that he
was not an officer of the law. Acock had
the best of legal advice and 'seemed to
be confident he could gain his point.
Judge Genty's decision shows that he was
correct.

Alexander Hischier testified that he
lived about three miles from the Mitchell
and Imsand places and that Albert Gayer
one of the defendants, was in his place
of business, on the afternoon of July 4
for an hour or more from .6 o'clock on.
According to the testimony of Miller,
James Oaks and Michael Sullivan, the
defendant was at the White House in
c Â£ lma o from shortly after 1 o'clock until
about 3 o'clock on the afternoon of July
\ Witt testified that Ehlers was
at his place on the same afternoon, leav
ing there about 4M5 o'clock. At 5 o'clock,
according to the testimony of Julius
Thiele, the defendant came to his house
to talk over plans for a barn which he
was to build for the witness. Thiele's
wife was at home at the time and Ferdi
nand Snyder came in a short time aÂ£ter.
knlersremained in the house until about
0:45. Thlele and Ehlers then went out to
look at the site for the building, remain
ing fifteen or twenty minutes, it being
then after 7 o'clock.
Mrs. Thiele. Martha Thiele and Ferdi
nand Snyder were called and corroborated
the te&tTmony of Julius Thiele.
G. Brooms, John Lears and Albert
Bleecker saw Ehlers at the former's place
that evening at H o'clock, where he re
mained until about 9 o'clock. f
Mrs. Catherine Tossl and her daughter.
Mary, reside near the Mitchell place. On
the afternoon of July 4 they saw Mitchell
shooting on his place.

that killed his wife came from and Mitch
ell s reply "from that window." pointing
to the Imsand house. They heard Mr
I 1 ox ask him who fired the shots, and hla
reply was that he didn't know. Accord

an entirely different story at the inquest
a few days later.

Thomas Egan. H. W. Brown and Daniel
Neville testified that they had known the

defendant. Ehlers; that Mitchell's repu
tation in the community for truth and
veracity was bad, while that of Ehlers
was good; that Ehlers was a peaceable
and uuiet man.
REDWOOD CITY, Oct. 12.â The defense
in the case of Caesar Ehlers, charged
with the murder of Elizabeth Mitchell,
to-day examined thirty-five witnesses and
had not concluded when court adjourned.
The testimony will be completed to-mor
row and arguments probably will com
mence on Monday morning.
Witnesses were called who swore that
they had seen Ehlera elsewhere at tho
time when Mitchell says he flred the shot
from the Imsand window that killed
Elizabeth Mitchell. Others testified to
the bad reputation of William Mitchell
for truth and veracity and the good char
acter of Ehlers. Testimony was given
that would tend also to disprove the
charge against Albert Gayer, who is ac

SACRAMENTO, Oct. 12.â The an
nouncement made by The Call yesterday
morning that Rev. C. B. Kiddick of Oak
land probably would succeed David S.
Hirschberg as superintendent of the Pres
ton School of Industry at lone formed a
subject* for lively discussion in political
circles in this city. That there is good
ground for The Call's statement of an Im
pending change Is verified by sensational
disclosures made In the Bee to-night of
alleged scandalous maladministration of
the affairs of the Preston School by Su
perintendent Hirschberg. He Is charged
with brutal treatment of a boy inmate
and with suffering the grossest kind of
immorality to flourish among the boya
conllded to his care. It Is declared that
the trustees of the school will meet at
lone to-morrow and demand his resigna
tion as superintendent.
Instances of misconduct and immorality
are specified. The case of a boy named
Carly, whose father lives in Sacraipento
and is employed by the railroad, is men
tioned.
"This boy," the Bee says, "was In the
hospital as the result of treatment at the
hands of older boys. And yet Carly'a
ie oTily an aggravated case of what is a
more or less common practice at the
school."
Continuing, the Bee. which gathered its
information from reliable sources at Tone,
says: "A boy, Jerry Green, accused of be
ing late at dress parade, when the evi
dence showed that the lateness was
caused by his having gone to inform the
officers ot" the school of the escape of two
inmates, was, it is alleged, beaten per
sonally by Hirschberg, knocked down and
had his eyes blackened and his face
otherwise pummeltd so as to be nearly
unrecognizable. Until recently escapes
have been common. Now the discipline ia
so lax that no one wants to get away."
For some time the bandmaster at the
school was Adams, the leader of the First
California Regiment Band, which went
through the Philippine campaign with the
California volunteers. Adams was fined
$10 by Hirschberg because a boy under
his charge escaped. He refused to pay
the fine and was discharged. Hirschberg,
it is asserted, has had a personal row
with nearly every officer in the institu
tion. -
It is charged against- the institution
that grown men are taken Into the Insti
tution under the guise of boys. The age
limit is fixed by law at IS years, but there
are many cases of commitments to the in
stitution of youths of "20 and even 21
years. Most of these are said to be thor
oughly depraved and their innuence upon
the younger inmates is bad. Illrschberg
is declared to be thoroughly unable to
keep the boys In subjection.

II. B. de Marville was summoned, but the child never regained consciousness and
died at 11 o'clock. Death was due to the bursting of a blood vessel In the brain.
Miss Payson was 16 years old. Although delicate as an infant and as a
small child, of late years she developed into a healthy girl. She was studious,
but was also inclined to athletics. She was one of the best golf players of her
age on the Burlingame links, where she played regularly with her father. She
was a fine rider and could handle the ribbons dextrously. The funeral will prob
ably take place next Wednesday.*

Prior to August SI the Government pur
chased In California and sent to the Phil
ippines B1C1 horses and mules. Since that
date the Government has purchased in
California 1330 horses and 550 mules. For
these TOO* horses it is^omputed that S4.OO3
rounds of hay and 75,000 pounds of grain
â¢were daily required. The supplies of hay
and grain were obtained in San Francis
co, hence the farmers of California de
rived substantial benefit from the outlay.
At the beginning of hostilities the army
officers were able to obtain serviceable
horses at $65 per head, but in consequence
of the steady and active demand the price
ertvanced to tSO per head.

The law defining eight hours as a day's
work is faithfully observed in every
branch of the Government service. In
cases of great emergency, such. as haste
to make a transport ready for Immediate
service, skilled carpenters and other me
chanics have been permitted to work over
time, for which they received double^ pay.
In some instances carpenters have worked
sixteen hours a day, receiving $4 for the
iegnlar day's work of eight hours and $S
for. the eight hours' extra time. The op
portunity to earn extra money and at the
same time render the Government loyal

was invited according to law. The num

Many of these supplies were manufac

that fourteen thousand men were em

sum of $13/Ki0,000 for depot supplies. There
has been an additional disbursement of
$13,500,000 in the transport service for char

other expenses.
Since June, 1S78, Colonel William H.
Baldwin, commissary of 'subsistence, has
disbursed in payment of supplies pur
chased in San Francisco a sum approxi

It is calculated that the medical depart

Francisco since June, 1S9S, the sum of two
million dollars.
When it is considered that a large sum
of money has been paid out for wages of
men and for materials and supplies at
Mare Island Navy Yard, and that other
sums have beÂ«n paid out In the progres

IN IT TEN YEARS. !
An Unconscious Slave to Coffee.
"I had not the slightest idea that cof-
fee was the cause of my continued sick-
ness for the last ten years until I quit I
its use and took up Postum Food Cof-
fee. I never had a natural movement
of the bowels during a number of
years, because of chronic constipation,
and I was constantly under the influence
of medicine.
"Very frequently, just after break-
fast, a dizziness would come on. which
would force me to lie down and re-
main absolutely quiet until relief came.
I was also the victim of severe head-
aches, and miserable all the time. Two
years ago last October it suddenly oc-
curred to me that it was possible cof-
fee was the real cause of mv trouble.
"I therefore procured a oackace of
Postum Food Coffee and besran its use
in place of coffee. At first trial I did
not like it. and found some difficulty in
sticking to my resolution, but I perse-
vered and soon discovered that I had
not made it properly. \Vhen it is boiled
long enough it has a delicious Java
coffee taste 'and a beautiful, deep rich
brown color: altogether it makes a
charming beverage.
"I soon erew very fond of it: in fact.
I liked it better than I did the.old cof-
fee. A very' little chance in mv health
occurred and this gradually increased,
until in about two months I discovered a
marked change began to manifest itself.
The bowels resumed their natural func-
tions and the old, dizzy fcelinjr disap-
r^ared entirely, also trft headaches.
"This complete change in health
fixed my mind permanently and forever
never, under any circumstances, to co
back to a drug that had held me a
slave for ten long years. A curious
thing about all this is that people do
not realize the cause of their troubles.
They go on year after vear. iust as I
had. in drugging themselves with some-
thing that holds them in a condition of
sickness and they don't seem to wake up
to understand what it is that is the
cause of the trouble. If such people
could bring themselves to leave off cof-
fee and use Postum Food Coffee, the
trial would tell its own tale. Please
omit my name." Name and address

STOCK A1TD BOND EXCHANGE.
Local stocks and bonds continued quiet and
featureless, a decline In Gas and Electric to
51U being the only noteworthy change
The Oil Exchange did its usual good busi
ness. It has been selling considerable iSockor
THE STOCK MARKET.
NEW TORK. Oct. 12. â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say: Though some measures of busi
ness volume and value make unfavorable com
parison with a year ago and speculation Is
certainly on a reduced scale In nearly all
lines other registers of trade activity are still
very favorable and It Is hard to resist the con
clusion that, with few notable exceptions, the
actual business of the country la as a rule
fully equal to If not slightly in excess of the
corresponding period of ISM. This, too, is Uie
case In Eplte of the distinctly repressive ten
dency exercised by the prenent Presidential
campaign. Prices of staples as a whole art
firm after a sustained advance for a month
past succeeding a summer of quiet steadiness,
but unhealthlness of the short side In specu
lation lias been : brought forcibly to the at
tention of dealers in a number of staples,
notably hog products and flaxseed.
The event of the week in the iron and ateel
trade has been the taklr.fe of 150,000 tons rails
by the Pennsylvania at J26 per ton, announced
on Friday. This action will In all probability
be followed by other companies and disposes oi
the steel rail puzzle satisfactorily the rail
makers and constitutes another element of
strength to the Industry generally. Despite a
decrease of over 20 per cent In the current pig
iron production from four months ago furnace
stocks are reported increasing and prices are
rather weak. The considerable volume of hand
to-mouth buying, however, presupposes that
consumers' stocks are well down. In structural
and bridge material the feature Is the placing
of the contract for the new East River brldgt,
which calls for nearly 70,000 tons. Relatively
the mest activity in pig iron is reported at
Birmingham, where sales and shipments are
quite heavy.
Wheat, including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 4,292.835 bushel?, against 4,459,
1â¬7 bushels last week and 5,625,634 bushels 111
1S99.
From July 1 to date this season wheat ex
ports are 51,514,522 bushels, against 60,965,047
bushels last season and 57.22S.176 bushels in
1S98-99.
Business failures for the week in the United
States number 210, as against 177 last week and
1S4 In 1890.
Failures In the Dominion of Canada num
ber 36. as compared with 18 laat week and 13

WHEAT â The decline was more pronounced
yesterday, and on the morning sessions there
was a slump, accompanied by the heaviest sell-
Ing seen in this market for a long time. Wheat
seems to have no friends at the moment,
though there is no apparent reason for the de
cline.
Liverpool and Paris were lower, but New
York advanced slightly. Chicago opened weak,
with the bears hammering the market. The
decline there was ascribed to continued liquida
tion, but it was thought that strong Interests
were absorbing the sales. The export business
was small, but 300.0CO bushels cash wheat were
worked. The next visible supply is expected
to show an increase. The weather In the
Northwest was reported fine. Argentine ship
ments were 800,000 bushels.

NEW TORK. Oct. 12.â The undertone of the
ptodf market became strong to-day and prices
moved upward pretty consistently to the clot*,
which was ttrong but notably dull and with
cair.e well maintained. The dominant factor
in the market was Uie large engagement or
Cold fcr import. London, Paris and Berlin all
contributing, the total amounting to 12,7^0,000.
The dealings in 6tocks were net large at any
time and to-day's operations were attributed
to professionals fcr the most part. There waÂ» !
a fair distribution cf the strength, but the
effective dealings during the day were con
o-ntrated In a few stocks, and those distin
guished lor the recent large short selling from
which they have suffered. People's Gas was
the notable example in the industrial lift.
The Mock sold off sifter the opening on thj
presumption that yesterday's buying had satis
fied the demand from the shorts, but the large
covering at the decline caused a renewed ad
vance and it was lifted at one time an extreme
1%. closing w:th a net pain of I 1 *. In the
railroad llFt Northern Pacific was in largest
demjind on tuylng supposed to be for inside
interests. But here aiso the short Interest
played an important part in the day's aj
vanee. which reached 2%, with a net gain of
2V4- But while the strength of these two stocks
was pre-eminent a list Hjf those which !Â«:>se
from 1 to Z points was a long one. Notwlth
rtanding the notable dullness at the ia-st the
closing was strong and pains were well main
tained. The failure of the money rate to re
tpond to the o;*rations in the stock market
gave color to the BUpposition that they were
conducted by professional operators who had
Fupplied themselves with time loans %vlth a
view to such a contingency am the present.
The coil loan rate In fact was Inclined to saj,,
ihÂ«- ruling rate declining to 3 per cent, not
withstanding that loans made to-day carry
o\>r until Monday. Reports cf the receipt of
additional gc'.d at Pacihc Coart points, which
will be quickly available by telegraphic trans
fer to the NÂ«?w York money market, and the
lessened demand upon the market by the su!v
trcasury by reason of the large midmonthiy
]>enslcn payments were a!so accepted a& prom
ise of relief for the money market.. The most
substantial encouragement in the day's events
va* from the fact that the Bank of Franco
seemed disposed to treat demands for gold
more leniently, that ' institution being basi
equipped cf all the world's treat banks to
*>uppl/ gold.
Bunds were quiet and changes were unim
portant. Total Mies, par value. $770,000.

Call loans in particular have been generally
advanced to 3Ht Per cent and the rate touched
4 per cent, while time money Is closely held at
4 ;>er cent for all periods. The further sharp
decline in exchange to $4 Â£3'.Â£ for demand ster
ling created a feeling that gold Imports from
Europe would quickly replenish New York's de
pleted reserve. About S3.650.CO) gold was taken
for shlnment to I^ondon and Paris, but. it ap
pears from the circumstances that the Euro
pean money centers will offer Btout opposition
to withdrawals of specie to this country, and
that international bankers are averse to any
action, unless it is absolutely necessary, that
would increase the strain upon the Berlin and
London markets. The rise In gold bars and
eagles at the latter city and the decided hard
ening of its open money market would indicate
that. If needful, artificial obstacles will be
placed in the way of large exports. It must
be recognized, however, that the decline of ex
change, the feeling that gold could be with
drawn from abroad If the money markÂ»t her*
Â»-hou!d be seriously disturbed, has had a calm
ing influence on the stock market. Another fa
vorable feature Is that the present strength o>
money was foreseen by the street and In a
large measure provided for by making time
loans and the further conclusion that can be
drawn from all the apparent facts is that brok
erape houses, as a rule, are carrying fewer
stocks than for a long time past and their re
quirements of funds are thus greatly reduced.
Money Market conditions took the leading
place this week as a factor In the market, even

NEW YORK, Oct. 12.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial j cablegram says:
The market here was slack and drooping to
day on the expectation that the bank rate
would soon be advanced, although a rumor
was current that a rise may be rendered un
necessary by the Bank of France releasing
gold and large arrivals from India. The only
activity was In Americans, which spurted on
New York's early buying orders. They fin
ished buoyant on the buying from your side.
Silver collapsed on th<Â» announcement that the
Indian Government has completed its coinage
buying by the million sterling purchase. Never
theless the bazaar price has risen a farthing
to H% and Iniila might buy profitably. The
market depends on this.

President Jordan said In part:
"I have come to speak to you abotit a
difficulty Stanford is in. which can be
helped only by an amendment to the State
constitution. That constitution has been
called the worst document th^t ever a
civilized people lived under, but It has
been Improved by some sixty amendments.
It makes good business for the lawyers.
The endowment grant made by Leland,
Stanford was drawn up In a very clumsy
manner. It does not allow the university
to receive any property by bequest or to
hold any outside the State. There are
several valuable pieces of property which
we shall receive should this amendment
pass. Mr. Stanford's brother wishes to
leave his property In Australia, worth sev
eral millions, to the university, and a
wealthy army officer, without children,
has given the university a will to his
property in Washington and South Caro
lina, The wtll is not worth a cent unless
the amendment Is passed."
Dr. Jordan further explained that the
amendment would give the Legislature
the power to free the property held In
trust for the support of the university
"There is fcome one here who I ana
glad is going to speak to you. Some one
here with trouble on his heartâeduca
tional trouble. It is right for him to come
here to the mother university, to come
here to tell of it. Whatever la to be said
about educational affairs must be said
here at the mother university. It will be
a pleasure to hear from our good friend.
Dr. Jordan."
"I believe in the good old custom of the
New England chapel. I believe that It la
gxtod to come together and sing and pray
together. But since we cannot meet at
chapel every morning we must meet here
every week or two. so that we may know
that we are members, one and another.
of the same university."
In presenting Dr. Jordan President
Wheeler said;
Dr. Jordan was present to ask the sup
port of the university students on the con
stitutional amendment relatlr.g to tne Le
land Stanford Jr. University, which Is to
be voted on at the next election. He ex
plained what the amendment called, for.
what it meant to the university, to
education ar.d to the State. Dr. Wheeler
asked the students to co-operate with the
Stanford men. who are working for the
passage of the amendment. In addressing
the students President Wheeler said:

OAKLAND, Oct. 12.â The Oakland Rail
road Company has demurred to the com
plaint of ex-Policeman Henry McCIoy,
who askb for 120.000 damages for injuries
alleged to have been sustained In a col
lision at Shattuck and Alcatraz avenues.
The company sets forth that Mccjoy fails
to state whether ho was a passenger
for hire or whether he was riding free
in his capacity as a policeman.
From now on the word among the
| "farmers" will be practice. There will
l>e committees appointed for each depart
ment of the menu, and these will hold
nightly medicine dances In the kitchens
of the various residences. Extra tons of
coal and extra supplies for the larders are
being ordered. As fast as these are used
up more will be ordered, as the idea is
to guard against interruption of any sort.
The head man of each group will be
known as the "chef." From a pedestal
he will shout passages out of the recipe
volumes, and his assistants, who will be
officially designated as "cooks," will carry
out his orders. For 4nstance, If a cake
needs shortening, eggs, butter, lard, flour
and other Ingredients, there will be a
"cook" stationed at each receptacle con
taining these articles, and it will be his
duty to throw them accurately into the
mixer. A little practice will make him a
good Judge of distance. It may be a lit
tle confusing at first, but constant prac
tice will bring: order and victual" out of
chaos.
This unique dinner Is being arranged

ALAMEDA. Oct. 12.â There has been a

it was announced that the male members

place fin October 27. Every year about
this time the men of the Unitarian church
have a "harvest" festival to commemor

ami carrots are supposed to have been
Ftacke.1 up and sold. But never before
since this custom was given an Impetus
have these "farmers" been relied upon
to do their own cooking. They have been
accustomed to corral a tired feeling at
the end of the harvest and to take to the
hills to recuperate, generously allowing
the women fcik to pore over the cuisine.
This year it is to be different. That Is
why there is such a steady demand for
cook books.

CHARLES DANA GIBSON
FINDS A NEW "GIRL"
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Oct. 12.
All of the members of the Oakland City
Council have b o en summoned as witnesses
in the water rate suit, and all were pres
ent In court to-day apparently awaiting
with trepidation the time when they will
be called upon to tell what they know of
the passing oÂ£ the now famous water rate
ordinance. No doubt much of their con
cern Is occaslor.ed by the fact that they
may have to explain certain signed state
ments alleged to have been made by them
shortly after the present suit was com
menced.
That the water company's attorney*
have determined to bring out the fact
that these statements were made was
shown by the .method with which the ex
amination of Councilman Anson Barstow
was commenced this afternoon. After a
preliminary question or two the Council
man was asked if he had made a personal
Investigation of the Contra Costa Water
Company's plant before voting in favor
of the present water ordinance.
Before the witness could reply Robert
Y. Uayne objected, on the ground that
the Question involved the secret thoughts
of the witness. He quoted authorities to
prove his contention. He held that no or
dinance ever prepared would be worth a
cent if a Councilman could be compelled
to state his secret mental processes.
Mr. MeCutcheon claimed that secret
thoughts were not involved, but that the
City Council disregarded the testimony of
the plaintiff's employes regarding the
value of the water company's plant.
"We will show." he said, "that the
, Council was controlled by information re
ceived without the presence of the plain
tiff's representatives, and that but little
Jieed or tUne was given by the city's leg
islators to the subject of the valuation of
the company's plant or the proper return
to allow on Its investment."
Judge Hart -Â»aid he considered the point
raised a grave cne and wanted time In
which to consult authorities. He accord
ingly reserved his decision until the case
is again called, on Tuesday morning at 10
o'clock.
If the corporation gains its point each
one of the city's eleven Councilmen will
probably have a chance to explain
just what he meant when he signed
a statement that he had not given
the question of the plant valuation the
proper consideration before voting for the
ordinance. Thfs and one or two other
points In pome of the statements will
probably he raked over to an embarrass
ing extent by Attorneys Moore and Me-
Cutcheon.
The first qu?5tlon asked of Councilman
Barstow by Mr. MeCutcheon was:

this morning which nearly cost him his

The accident, which nearly resulted In

ordinance that is being attacked in this
present case?"
After Judge Hart had overruled Mr.
Hayne's objection the witness replied that
he did.
"What property did the Contra Costa
Water Company have at the time the or
dinance was passed?"
After an argument lasting over a half
hour Judge Hart ruled that the question
was not a proper one. During his argu
ment Mr. MeCutcheon took occasion to
lecture Mr. Barstow on the duties of a
Councilman. He concluded by faying
that the witness was about as competent
a Councilman as a schoolboy when he
voted to pass the water ordinance.
It was hero that the plaintiff's attor
neys wanted to know about the Council
man's Investigation of the company's
plant, and the examination was post
poned.
President Watklnson occupied the stand
this morning again. His examination
was along practically the samo lines as
the two previous days. Watklnson testi
fied that he owned five shares of stock In
the Contra Costa Water Company. H<s
wife's brother had five shares, his wife's
cousin five sharps and his wife's uncle,
Henry Pierce. 100 shares. Ho also tes
tified that he had always attended to the
dealings with thd City Council for the
water company.
Watklnson was called upon to give a
technical description of certain portions
of the company's plant, but his testimony
was frequently interrupted by objections.
Th" old sore spot of the company was
rubbed hard when Attorney Hayne agt>ln
brought up the subject of the twelve
wells at Alvarado, which were drilled, it
is claimed, to tap the former Oakland
Water Company's source of supply.
Watkinson testified that- he was present
at certain meetings of the Council when
the fixing of the water rates was dis
cussed last spring, hut could not remem
ber whether he stated at any of these
meetings that the twelve wells could pro
duce 3.500,000 gallons of water a day. How
ever, he would not deny that he made
such a statement. Mr. Watklnson testi
fied yesterday that the flow was at the
most but 1.500.000 gallons a. day.

Rev. Mr. Perkins, who passed through
the recent Chinese uprising unscathed,
paid the Boxers a tribute in so far as say
ing they were courageous men and had
won the admiration and respect of tiie
soldiers and missionaries at Tientsin.
They believed they were fighting for a
principle, the speaker said, and stood up
for it manfully.
At the afternoon session Rev. Dr. Boyn
ton of Detroit, chairman of the nomi
nating committee, made his report. He
paid a tribute to Dr. E. B. Webb, chair
man of tho prudential committee, and
D. Willis James, A'ice president of th*

presented the following names for elec
tion:
President, Samuel B. Campen, T/r. r>,. of
Boston.
Vice President, Henry Hopkins, D.D., of
Kansas City.
Rev. J. F. Loba. D.D., of Evanston. 111.,
and Rev. Dan F. Bradley, D.D., of Grand
Rapids made similar reports on other de
partments of work and made short ad
dresses. The following missionaries then
spoke of the work Iji their respective
fields: Rev. C. A. Nelson, Canton. China;
Rev. W. C. Wilcox. South Africa; Rev.
Edward S. Hume, Bombay, India; Rev:
E. B. Haskell, Turkey; Rev. B. P. Hol
ton, Ceylon, and Rev. H. P. Perkins, Lin
chang. North China.
Reference to the work in the missions
of Western and Central Turkey and the
Pacific islands was made and progress
shown. Dr. Clark In closing
"In reading the reports of these several
missions under the special care of Secre
tary Smith we are impressed with and
bear glad witness to the ability and fidel
ity of the administration. Intricate and
troublesome questions ever rising because
of war and famine and pestilence; press
ing emergencies, racial prejudices, ri\-al
organizations, personal misunderstand
ings, limited fundsâ these seem to haA'e
been wisely and happily adjusted. The
board may look forward with renewed
hope to larger and more -conspicuous ac
complishments in the coming year."
"Constantly increasing gains may be an
ticipated in Hongkong and Canton
through the intelligent efforts .of Chris
tian Chinese returning from America.
That their contributions toward this work
from their fellow countrymen here much
exceed the appropriations of the board is
a pleasing proof of their sincere Interest
in it. The superintendence by our mis
sionaries has been most discreet and ef
fective."
Reference in this, as In other reports,
is made to the splendid aid of the Chris
tian Endea\-or Society.
Rev. Dewet S. Clark. D. D., of Salem.
Mass., In behalf of the committee of
"eleven missions," under the care of the
Rev. Judson Smith, D. D., foreign secre
tarv, reported in brief as follows:
"The three missions of the board in Af
rica, Zulu, East and "West Central Africa,
send back to us most encouraging re
ports. South China, Shensl, Fuchau and
North China, notwithstanding the dis
turbed state of the empire during the past
season, have been nrosecuting their labors
with excellent results.
ST. LOUIS. Oct. 12.â At the morning
session of the ninety-first annual meeting

Jonesof Honolulu, who last night brought

Weekly Call.Sl.OO per Yeas
When ycuntr Stonewall Jackson, one of
the most awkward, ungainly and, seem-
ingly, unpromising youths that the South
has produced, heard of a vacancy at West
Point he immediately went to Washing-
ton, determined to pet the appointment,
and ho got tt. When he reached West
Point the other hoys laughed at him. but
one of them, wiih more penetration than
his companions, said: "That fellow looks
like he's come to stay." He did stay. He
worked hard, economized and saved
enough from his cadet's pay, after cover-
ing all expenses, to buy his sister a silk
dress. The world knows what battle? he
fought, what victories he won. in the last
years of his iife. It was determination
that gave to history this splendid name.â

The source of the manipulation was
found to be at Chicago, where the only
perceptible movement was. Foreign mar
kets had declined a trifle, but not enough
to cause apprehension. Eastern markets
were steady and local dealers are at a
loss to understand the downward tendency
of the Chicago market. Speculation was
rife, but explanations were not forthcom
ing. It was stated on the street that the
Chicago liquidation really meant nothing
other than a local fluctuation and that
the' market will at once restore itself.
Considerable excitement was created in
local commercial circles yesterday by a
sharp drop In wheat. There seemed to
be nothing In local or foreign conditions
to warrant the sudden decline. On the
contrary, Information which was supposed
to be, accurate indicated the promise of a
steady market and a gradual but safe ad
vance. Local dealers were at a loss, there
fore, to account for the drop, and when
they did discover the source of the down
ward movement they were more than ever
at a loss to explain it. They believe now,
however, that the market will qulckly
regaln its strength and that the manipu
lators who accomplished their little deal
yesterday have done all that is in their
power to do. -s
The decline was almost exclusively In
near futures, the others remaining prac
tically without disturbance. May wheat,
for example, closed on Thursday at 106*i
and closed yesterday at 106%. a practically
Immaterial decline. December wheat, on
the other hand, fell 3Mj points during the
day and sp9culators began to look for
cover. December wheat closed on Thurs
day at lQlYs and closed yesterday at 91%,
a drop of ZVz points.

Only one or two bills were put Into
shape, the perfecting of the others being
left to special committees that will meet
this morning. Fourteen of the fifteen
members of the special committee
appointed by State Superintendent
Kirk In San Jose last month were pres
ent, In addition to the regular executive
board.
Several of the proposed bills brought
out some sharp discussions, particularly
the one relating to consolidation of
rural school districts. By this arrange
ment it is planned to materially reduce
the cost of maintaining the rural schools.
The Idea is to, have the building centrally
located and conducted on a larger scale
â¢than most rural schools. By consolidat
ing It will be necessary to provide free
transportation for those pupils who live
a considerable distance from the school,
and it Is a question whether this added
expense would not very nearly offset the
economy resulting from consolidation.
Other questions to be shaped into bills
for legislative action include the election
of .Trustees in April Instead of "June; the
appointment of teachers between May
and June, and If the appointments are not
made during this time the teachers last in
charge to hold over; consolidation of rural
school districts, and transportation of pu
pils to a central school; an amendment to
the constitution so as to give high schools
recognition as a part of the State educa
tional system, and an amendment per
mitting the appointment of more mem
bers of the Board of Regents for the com
trol and government of the State Normal
schools.
Several matters of considerable import
ance to school affairs were taken up, one
of the principal questions being an
amendment to the compulsory school at
tendance law, which will be further ar
gued to-day. The amendment will follow
closely the law In force In New York and
Massachusetts, which provides for the or
ganization of parental schools to taken
care of truant pupils. Regular truant of
ficers are employed, whose duty It Is to
keep track of would-be runaways and If.
after being probated, the offending pupil
does not reform, he is sent to a truant
school fcr punishment.
The executive committee of the State
Educational Commission and the County
and City Superintendents of this State

ISSUE RAISED BY BRYAN DEMOCRACY
Great Meeting at
Metropolitan
Temple.
General Clark E. Carr. the veteran cam
paigner, addressed a great meeting In
Metropolitan Temple last night. He put
himself in friendly relations with his au
dience at the very beginning of his speech
and held their Interest and sympathy
throughout.
Generous In sentiment toward his polit
ical opponents. General Carr used good
natured sarcasm with telling effect and
he repeatedly provoked rounds of ap
plause by the use of homely Illustrations
and quaint expressions.
The stage was occupied mainly by the
officers and tome of the prominent mem
bers of the Grand Army posts of San
Francisco and near-by towns, to the num
ber of 150, who were the vice presidents
of the meeting. The audience was notably
high class and contained many of the old
g-uard of the Republican party. At least
a third cf those present were women.
General E. S. Salomon, formerly of Il
linois and an old friend of General Carr.
presided. By way of Introduction of the
speaker of the evening he said:
"This Imposing assemblage Is a refuta
tion of the charge that the Republican
party is apathetic In this campaign. Re
publicanism Is synonomous with patriot
ism, and a patriot will not be derelict
when his country's future Is at stake. I
&m here to introduce a gentleman who
can speak much more eloquently on the
issues of the campaignâ a gentleman from
Illinois, where true Republican principles
are cherished. It is my pleasure to intro
duce Mr. Clark E. Carr."

As General Carr stepped to the front Of
the platform the audlencp broke Into ap

When It had subsided he spoke as fol

of the earth cannot destroy. This Is the
Union, the union of the hearts of the people.
What of our commercial future? We have
200.000 tQuare miles of coal. To-day we take
out vastly more coal than England, and we
125ft it all. while England sells a third of hers.
Fo with Iron; we manufacture more steel than
England. In textile fabrics we have passed
England. In brains and brawn we excel. Our
artisans produce twice as much per capita as
England's; that Is why we are getting the
markets of the world.
It was not all of the time In the last thirty
years that this progress waa being made. In
t'.-.at time there have Intervened two Demo
cratic administrations. I remember the tariff
tfflfkcriSMK of tfcat first administration and the
t'liehxir.g influence it had on the industries of
tt* country. I remember how one man met
tie Morriron bill and fought It, and met the
Mills bill and foupht It. Every time the coun
try ha*= turned neainst the advice of this man
and accepted Democratic doctrine there has
b^en hard times, and every time the people
have followed the lead of William McKlnley
there has been prosperity.
I have Â»wn traveling through the orange
grovei of Southern California until it seemed
to me there was nothing on earth but oranges.
Before leaving my home town of Galesburg I
inaulred and found that forty car loads of
orances were distributed from Galesburg last
year. In 1S?5 there were but fifteen car loads
distributed from there. People could poorly af
ford luxuries then.
You remember how those times were and yet
they ask you to come back and vote the Dem
ocratic ticket. The mills were closed or run
ning half time. How many tourists did you
have out litre? You had a few Democratic
orators ar.i that was all.
Railroad freight receipts fell off half and
passf-r.gfr receipts more. Farm products fell
off in price to a like degree, and that Is where
It etruek us In Illinois. Livestock was down
In price. Hogs v.ere not worth anything.
Everything was a drug on the market.
The Democrats adopted the Wilson bill. When
Mr. Wilson made his final speech Just before
the bill was to be passed a big, brawny man
rushed forward, and, seizing Wilson in his
arms, carried him In triumph to the cloak
room. That man was William Jennings Bryan.
Mr. Gompers has said that the terrible period
or misery and want beglr.r.lr.g In 1S33 ended
with the vear ISJ7. The dawning of that new
period was the election of William McKlnley.
They say that times are still hard because a
strike is on. Did you ever hear of men striking
when they were out of a Job?
Now. there Is prosperity everywhere. You
say will it continue? I say it will continue
if William McKir.ley is re-elected.
When I came home at the close of President
""Westward the cause of empire takes Its way;
The four first acts already past.
A fifth shall close the drama with the day;
Time's noblest offspring- is the last."
STEVENSON NOT COMING.
Democratic Meetings in Assembly
Districts Arranged for Next Week.
The Democratic State Central Commit
tee has been trying to get the national
committee to send Adlai E. Stevenson to
the coast, but definite word has been re
ceived that he cannot be sent. It is bare
ly possible that ex-Governor Pattison of
Pennsylvania iray be heard by California
audiences before the close of the cam
paign.
The Democratic County Committee has
arranged several district meetings for
next week.
A meeting will be held Monday night at
Teutonla Hall, on Howard fetreet near
Ninth, for the Thirty-first and Thirty
ninth Assembly districts.
The Thirty-seventh and Thirty-eighth
Assembly districts win have a meeting
Tuesday evening at Mowry Hall, Laguna
and Grove streets, and the Thirty-second
District will have a meeting at 530 Third
street.
The Forty-third Assembly District
Democrats will hold a rally "Wednesday
night at California Hall.
The Twenty-eighth and Twenty-ninth
Assembly districts will hold a Joint meet
ing Thursday night at 824 Howard street.
Joseph Plunkett, candidate for State Sen
ator, and other candidates will speak.
On Friday night the Forty-fourth and
Forty-fifth district Democrats will have a
rally at Bersaglierl Hall.
Jefferson Democrats Meet
The Jefferson Democratic Club of the
Thirty-first Assembly District held a
meeting last night at Trades Hall. A
number of aspirants for various offices
addressed the club on the merits of their
candidacy. Among them were Porter
Ashe, Superior Judge Lauior, D. S.
O'Brien, Louis A. Ward, candidate for
Senator In the Twenty-third Senatorial
District, and R. Sullivan. Charles As
mussen arraigned the present administra
tion for Its alleged policy of imperialism
and brief addresses were also made by
Tim Treacy, James Bowlan. John C. Hee
nan. Resolutions were adopted condemn
ing the methods of the leaders of the
Democratic party in this city. "
Campaign Notes.
Judge George H. Bahrs has resolved to
enter the local campaign as a candidate
for re-election to the office of Superior
Judge. A petition with the required num
ber of signatures will be filed In time to
Insure his name a place on the ticket.
Harrison' Â¦ administration I found everybody
busy. In the columns of the paper I found
"wanted, wanted, wanted"â men wanted In the
factories, in the mines, on the farms. I thought
It was not possible that the people could turn
against an administration that had given them
such good times. But arguments such as the
Democrats are presenting now prevailed, and
Cleveland was elected. Distress and want and
misery were the result.
AMERICANS FOHGET.
The trouble with the American people Is that
when they are prosperous they forget their own
Interests, and If McKlnley falls of election It
will be because of this apathy. *
Tou need not worry about Illinois. Don't
worry about the prairies. They are all right
and will back tip California with the old Re
publican majorities. We had Altgeld rour
years and we have him with us yet aa an ex
amrle.
They try to throw dust in our eyes. Mr.
Bryan said hard times would follow the gold
standardâ and you can always rely upon Bryan
a* a prophet. The opposite of what he prophe
sies always comes true. We have come to the
gold standard and we are proeperpus. AVe have
continued to coin silver, more than ever. The
Democrats say unlimited coinage of silver. We
say coin as much as you can, but keep It in
check and only coin as much as you can and
keep It at par.
Mr. Bryan insisted that he would not be a
candidate unless 16 to 1 was Inserted. I know
Mr. Bryan too well and I esteem him too much
to believe that h* would accept election on that
platform and not do all in his power to bring
about free coinage. There Is no question but
that he could unsettle the finances of this coun
try- Senator Allison and Secretary Gage have
shown how he could practically bring us to a
silver basle in four years. If you want our
prosperity all turned over again and changed
to want vote for William Jennings Bryan.
But to throw dust in our eyes they have
brought up another issue. I want to read you
a plank from the Democratic platform. (Read-
Ing.) Do you Democrats approve of that?
(Voices, "Tes. Tes, it Is the beet in the plat
form.") Why. ray friends, you Indorse that.
and It is in the platform that was directed
against General Grant, that hero who had not
the least of the spirit of Imperialism. You
approve it and do not know It from the anti
imperialistic plank of the Kansas City piat
fcrm.
Senator Hoar denounced Mr. Bryan for se
curing the adoption of the treaty of peace by
which we acquired the Philippines. Without
Mr. Bryan's aid the treaty could not be ap
proved. He gave that a!d and then turned
and has been preaching Imperialism ever since.
It looks as if he thought free s!l\-er was get
ting a little sick.
The Spanish war began and there was Bent
to Dewey at Hongkong this message. "Find
and capture or destroy the Spanish fleet." Was
ever so terse an order sent or vo brilliantly
carried out? The man who wrote that, as
Assistant Secretary of the Navy, was Teddy
Roosevelt.
The President knew what war wan. and tried
to avoid It. I was told the other aay by
General Harrison Gray Otis that he himself
once partook of coffee carried along the firing
line, a thing unprecedented, by Lieutenant
William MeKinley. When Sheridan made, his
famous ride he found a young lieutenant try-
Ing to rally the troops. It was William Mc-
Klnley.
TTPHOLD SELF-GOVERNMENT.
There never was a case on record when â¢ we
came Into new territory that we gave it self
government unless we thought it was fit for
It. We did this with California, we did -this
with Mexico, we did this with my own State
of Illinois. There never has been a case . yet
when the United States finds the people cap
able, of self-government that they don't Ret
it. j That's what we'll do with the inhabitants
of 'the Philippine* just as soon as they are
ready for it Â¦Â¦-.'Â¦
We gave $20,000,000 to raise that flag In the
Philippines and do you think we are going to
pull it down to suit Mr. Agulnaldo? (Cries of
"Never! Never'.") - Â¦â¢
You'll hear that the Filipinos will come over
here and take our workmen's places. I've had
some little experience of San Francisco climate,
and I don't think there's much danger of peo
ple who wear nothing to think of but sunshine
taking up a permanent residence here.
It has invariably been a Democratic admin
istration that ha* lowered the flag. - It was
hauled down in Hawaii under Cleveland, but
William McKlnley put it up again.
Now for this great unknown Orient, lying
at our doors, full of wonderful possibilities
for us. For it Is for us. We must have of it
an equal share with the rest of the world. If
we would rank as we do to-day foremost among
the great nations of the earth. But In order
to develop the trade of thoee possessions we
must establish a money standard. We must
have a dollar which will be of equal value In
China, the United States and every isle of
the Pacific over which Old Glory floats.
Now. my friends of the Pacific Coast, I may
never see you again. But I want to tell you
that all the benefits of these new lands are
for you. Throuffh your ports must come the
steel, the coal, the iron,, which are to make
them fit sisters to these North American
State: of ours.
Once long ago the Mediterranean Sea was the
center of the world's commercial activity. The
great maritime nations. England, Scandinavia
and Spain, with her great armadas, made It
what it was. But soon a new land was die
covered beyond the Atlantic. All the nations
whose Ideas had hitherto centered about the
Mediterranean began to look westward. "From
that moment the steady march of nations-be
gan. To-day the Orient opens before us. '
The "open door" Into China Is the srand
eet diplomatic achievement In all history."
William McKlnley does not seek the dismem
berment of China. But he does want it thrown
open for our trade. It may be an effort to us
to carry thlÂ« out: It may coat time and money;
but In the end It will be aa ever:

CONTRACT PLAN!
If you rent a poor piano at $3 1
month and keep it for five years, you
will have paid $180 and at the end
own r.o piano.
If you rent an ordinary piano at
$4 a month and keep it for five years,
you will have paid $240 and at the
end own no piano.
If you rent a fair piano at $.s a
montn and keep it for five years, you
will have paid $.100 and at the end
own no piano.
Butâ if you get a good brand new
piano (guaranteed by the manufac-
turers), valued at $300. from Sher-
man, Clay & Co. on their new rent
contract plan, and pay S6 a month
for 62 months, you will have paid
$375 and at the end of that time the
piano is yours.
Don't you think it better to pay
$1.25 a month for the use of the
piano than $3, $4 or $3?
Note â For obvious reasons the
sale of pianos on this new rent con-
tract plan is confined to the cities and
suburbs where the stores are located.
