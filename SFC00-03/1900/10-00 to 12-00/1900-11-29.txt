PARIS, Nov. 28.â The conversation
which former President Kruger had with
the French Minister of. Foreign Affairs,
M. Delcasse, yesterday, was confined to
the former sounding the latter as to the
probable attitude of France in certain
eventualities. Mr. Kruger did not press
for a definite statement and the conver
sation lacked precisene.ss. M. Delcasse let
it be understood that France . had not
changedher attitude' since he explained
tho Government's- position in the Cham
ber of Deputies lafet March. France Will
not take. the initiative in -intervention in
South' Africa, but' will not. discourage any
other country, from so doing. On the con
trary, she will Join in. such initiative taken
under such conditions as appear to her
to merit acquiescence.
Mr. Kruger did not Intimate what he In
tended to do, but it'is believed he will take
the official diplomatic step at The Hague.
It is not known whether he will ask Hol
land to propose mediation Â«r open -other
and less clearly defined negotiations.
Mr.. Kruger to-day drove to the School
of Fine Arts to inspect the plaster., model
of the monument to be erected to tho
memory of Colonel de Vlllebois-Mareuil,

According to the naval register the Yo
semite was manned by eighteen offlcers
and 2S7 men, but In her capacity as sta
tion ship not all of these were required,
and undoubtedly a part of them were
ashore engaged In duties at v the navy
yard. This probably will be true of her
commander. Seaton Schroeder. who Is also
Governor of Guam, and who probably left
the active command of the ship to the
ranking lieutenant. Augustus N. Mayer.
The old offlcers accredited to the ship by
the register are: Lieutenantsâ W. E. Saf
ford. Albert Moritz. B. B. Biereo: Ensigns
âA. W. Pressy. H. L. Collins. A. T. Mitch

Just before the outbreak of the Spanish-
American war the vessel was purchased
by the Navy Department, fitted as an
auxiliary cruiser and rendered effective
service as one of the patrol fleet, being
manned in part by the Michigan naval
militia. It Is said her anchorage at Guam
was off the harbor of San Luis d'Apra,
and that owing to her draft she was
obliged to stay six miles off shore. The
harbor Is a particularly dangerous one
owing to the existence of a rocky shoal
In the middle of a very crooked channel.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 2S.â The Yosemite
was first commissioned April 13, 1X)S. She
had been the station ship at the Island of
Guam since the days of the Spanish war.
She was a slxteen-knot converted cruiser
of 6179 tons displacement, and was pro
vided with a main battery of ten five-Inch
rapid-tire guns and a secondary battery
of six six-pounders and two ! Colt rifles.
She had a complement of eighteen officers
and 267 men. Her measurements were 291
feet in length by 43 feet extreme breadth.
She had a mean draught of 20 feet 1 Inch.
After the violence of the storm had sub
sided efforts were made to start the en
gines. At 1:30 p. m.. November 15. the
Justin, which had started In search of the
Yosemite. picked her up and attempted to
tow her back to Guam. Two hawsers were
broken, and it was then decided that it
was Impossible to take. her into port. The
cruiser was then scuttled, after which she
was abandoned, all hands going aboard
the Justin. The Tosemite sank bow first
at 3 o'clock and the Justin stood away for
Guam.
Paymaster Ballard saved $68,000 In Mexi
can money from sinking with the ship.
Meanwhile the Yosemite was drifting
hopelessly before the gale, which was
blowing at the rate of a hundred miles an
hour. A sea anchor had been put out. and
this held the Yosemite up into the teeth
of the storm and prevented her from fall-
Ing off Into the trough of the sea. She
rode to this anchor and drifted rapidly
until 6 o'clock in the evening, when the
weather cleared. The cruiser was then
sixty miles north and forty miles west of
Guam. She had labored so heavily that
she had sprung a leak.
Boatswain Sweeney and twelve of the
crew volunteered to take a lifeline ashore.
A boat was lowered for. this purpose, but
It was Immediately swamped by a big sea
that swept over it. AH Its occupants were
carried away from the boat; but they
miraculously succeeded in reaching land
after hours of struggle with the waves.
The, storm veered around after the Yo
semlte grounded, and she was driven off
and carried onto Roma ye Cliffs, where her
rudder and propeller were broken.
The auxiliary cruiser Tosemite, which
was occupying a berth near the collier
Justin, dragged her anchors and was
driven aground a hundred yards from the
reef. Her bows were crushed In. A
launch with a crew of five men had pre
viously left the ship to endeavor to And a
safe anchorage for the cruiser, the indica
tions being the anchors would not hold
where, she was. The men were not seen
after they left the ship, and it is prac
tically; certain the heavy sea which .the
â¢tonn kicked up swamped the launch. The
bodies of Cockswain F. Swanson and Sea
man George Anhel were recovered after
the typhoon subsided.
MANILA, Nov. 2S.â The transport Sher

island of Guam on November 13. demol

'LONDON. Nov. 29.â "An imperial Irade
orders the immediate signature of a con
tract for th* construction of a fast cruiser
by the Cramps of Philadelphia," says the
Constantinople correspondent of the Daily
Chronicle. "The price agreed upon will
give a sufficient surplus to pay the Amer
ican indemnities.' Thus the United States
gains an important commercial and dip
lomatic success."
..The Navy Department has given no
further orders to the Kentucky beyond
those directing her to proceed to Smyrna
for a five days' stay. The department has
received a letter from Captain Chester of
the Kentucky, mailed from Gibraltar,
telling of a storm which the ship passed
through on the Atlantic and the oppor
tunity it afforded of testing the sea-goln;
qualities of the big battleship. The
storm arose on the 30th Inst. and raged
that day and the next. The waves tore
away the starboard lifeboat and beat it
to pieces. This was the only mishap.
Captain Chester says that throughout the
storm the battleship behaved beautifully
and showed excellent seaworthy quali
ties.
Cable advices say the Vienna Tageblatt
publishes a dispatch from Constantinople
tp't5teÂ«rrect.that J the;Turklsli Council "of
Ministers . has j held a conference to de
termine whether or not the sending of the
United', States battleship Kentucky to
Smyrna should be regarded as an act of.
hostility. According to the Tageblatt's
dispatch one Mini3ter urged the severance
of diplomatic relations with the United
States and even went so far as to
threaten war unless the Kentucky should
be withdrawn from Turkish waters. The
Ministers express the belief that the
European poweTs would not permit the
United States to attack Turkey, and that
the country, therefore, would be safe In
taking a defiant attitude. , Â¦
The Kentucky -arrived to-day at
Smyrna. Partly aa a result All Ferrouh
Bey, the Turkish Minister, called at tha
State Department. When he left he said
he had been assured that the visit of the
vessel was not connected with *he refusal
of his Government to Issue an exequatur
to the American Consul at Harpoot, or
with the missionary claims controversy.
It is understood that Secretary Hay in

organized to locate the line. The estab-
TEL. WASHINGTON, Nov. 2S.-Secretary
Hay to-day took steps to prevent Minister
Conger from becoming a party to the pro
gramme of butchery. Under the instruc
tions sent to Mr. Conger he will withhold
until further notice his signature from the
agreement already approved by the Min
isters in Peking or any which they may
adopt In future, and will cable the text
of the protocol to Washington for consid
eration by the President. Mr. Conger will
undoubtedly "understand this as a rebuke
for his approval of the vengeance policy
embodied in the document. It is believed
here that all the other powers, with the
exception of Germany, have sent similar
instructions to their representatives In
Peking.
Notwithstanding the apparent isolation
of Germany, a feeling of decided pessim
ism prevailed to-day as to the outcome
of the peace negotiations. The next ten
days, said one official, will probably be
the most important in the whole of the
Chinese affair, as a decision which will
znÂ«in war,or.pea<;e-will-berf:eachcd> .Â».-,-.Â¦â¢ - '
Great Britain, Russia, Japan and France
seem In harmony with the desire of the
United States to modify the terms of the :
Peking agreement relative to the punish
ment and indemnity and to present de
mands' with which the Chinese Govern
ment can comply.
It became known to-day that American
Consuls have been negotiating with ex
cellent results with the Viceroys of prov
inces regarding indemnities for the mur
der of missionaries and damages to mis
sions. Similar negotiations have been
conducted by English Consuls.
BERLIN. Nov. 2S.â An inspired article in
the Post says: "The possible. If improb
able, modification of the punishment of
the guilty officials In China would not "in
the least be dictated by considerations of
humanity, but rather by considerations of
political expediency. Germany never In
sisted on the punishment or death of cer
tain persons. She desires, first of all. that
the powers should demand the punishment
of the guilty, being guided by the wish
that all the eight powers act in concert."
The Militar Wochenblatt, discussing the
charges of cruelty on the Germans In
China, admits that "under certain circum
stances prisoners may be dangerous nnd
no prisoners must be taken.
"The German army," the paper adds,
"â¢should not be accused of cruelty without
considering the facts !n the ilght o* con
ditions."
A dispatch received here from Tientsin,
dated Monday, November 26, says: "The
provisional administration here, in which
Germany, the United Staves. Russia,
Great Britain, Frar.ce and Japan are rep
resented, decided tc-day unanimously to
demolish the wall and fill iip the ditch
around Tientsin."
LONDON, Nov. 29.â The Berlin Carre
s' poTdent of the Standard says he hears
that Germany has notified the United,
States of her willingness to waive the de
mand for the execution of the Chinese of
ficials.
liFhment cf this line will probably end
the efforts of the Inhabitants of the so
called republic of Acre to achieve Inde
pendence, as mary of them are Brazilians
and will be satisfied If their homes are
found to be In Brazilian territory. Mr.
<3e Assls-Brasll Insists that there Is no
foundation for the report that his Govern
ment has fomented trouble In Acre, and
declares that It has observed a very cor
rect attitude. The dispute with Ecuador,
with Bolivia and Uruguay as well, grows
out of the fact that the boundary line has
never been definitely located.

MANIAC HOLDS
UP TRAVELERS
NEAR REDDING
Murderer of Prank Michaels
Evidently an Insane
Highwayman.
ATTEMPTS TWO MORE ROBBERIES
Woman and Her Daughter When
Stopped by the Fellow Escape
. by Plying Whip to Their .
Horses.
Special Dispntch to The Call.
REDDING. Nov. 2?.â There seems no
lonper reason to doubt that the Fraser
Hill read near Bella Vista is being haunt
ed by an insane highwayman, and that it
was he who murdered Frank Michaels of
Portland, whose body was fourtd cold in
death with a bullet wound through the
skull. Michaels had startrd U> walk from
Bully Hill to Redding, and met death on
the way. At first there was same doubt
as to whether he had been murdered or
committed suicide, but recent develop
ments preclude the possibility that he
took his own life.
On Tuesday evening Hprt Hall, a far
mer, was ordered to halt by a highway
man at the spot where Michael's body
was found. He replied by discharging a
shotgun at the man. The robber returned
the fire from a rifle. Both shots were in
effective.
To-night comes news of an attempt to '
hold up Mrs. Antone Spiegel and her little
daughter as they were returning from
Redding. In the same stretch of woods
a man stepped out and attempted to take
hold of the bridle of one of their horses,
at the same time asking some irrelevant
question regarding the contents of the
buggy. Mrs. Spiegel did not reply. She
had the lines in her grasp and told her
little daughter to lash the horses with
the whip. The girl did so and. the ani
mals tore past the highwayman and down
the road.
It is held that no sane man would have
attempted a second and a third hold-up
on the scene of his former crimp. The
highwayman's actions when he stopped
Farmer Hall seem to indicate a thirst for
blood rather than a desire for booty.
HIGHWAYMAN ROBS WOMAN.
Compels Mrs. Josie Adams of Mon
rovia to Give Up Her Purse.
LOS ANGELES, 'Nov. 2S.-While driv
ing from Pasadena â¢ to Monrovia thii
afternoon in a buggy. Mrs. Josie Adams
of Monrovia was held up by a highway
man and robbed of what money she had
with her. She was alone, and Just before
she reached Santa Anita avenue a
masked man jumped from behind a tree,
and seizing the horse by the bridle
brought it to a stop.- Drawing a revolver,
he pointed it at Mrs. Adams and ordered
her to hand over what money she had.
threatening to kill her if she refused.
Half paralyzed by fear. Mrs. Adams sur
rendered her purse. The bandit then
ordered her to drive on and not look
around, saying he would shoot if she did
not obey. She was too frightened to look
back, leashing her horse Into a run. she
drove into town as rapidly as possible and
gave the alarm.
Policeman Willets went in search of the
highwayman and several posses were or
ganized and- have joined In the pursuit.
The robber evidently escaped into the
timber, which is quite heavy on that por
tion of the Baldwin ranch. The hold-up
took 'place on White Oak avenue, one cf
the most frequented thoroughfares in the
county.
Mrs. Adams saya she can easily identi
fy the robber. She is almost prostrated
by the nervous shock.

QUARRELSOME MEXICANS
IN A STABBING AFFRAY
Jesus Medino Murders Rubio Flores
During a Saloon Brawl at '
Alamo.
SAN DIEGO, Nov. 28.â A special dis
patch to the Union tells of a fatal stab
bing affray this morning in a saloon at
Alamo, Mexico, a minine camp about six
ty miles east -jf Ensenada, Lower Califor
nia. Jesus Mcdino, a young Mexican
miner, stabbed a fellow . countryman
named Rubio Flores three times in the
neck and breast. Either of the wounds
would have proved fatal and Flores lived
but a few minutes â barely lone: enough to
make it certain that Medino was the man
who wielded the knife.
Medino took to the brush immediately,
and it was only a short time before the
five rural guards of the camp were orrthe
hunt for him. It is more than likely he
will be in jail In Ensenada before to-mor
row night, though his familiarity with the
country Is likely to help him through.
The cause of the affray is not known,
but both Medino and Flores were known
to be quarrelsome. Flores was formerly
one of the Mexican rurales at the mining
camp, and while on duty killed a young
boy without any apparent cause. He was
found guilty and sentenced to six years'
imprisonment, a sentence which he fin
ished Berving.a few months ago.

SAN JOSE, Nov. 28.â A contest Is'prom
ised over the estate of William B. Frue,
the capitalist, who died. In this city on
November 9. The first step was taken to
day by Public Administrator .Kell, who
filed a petition for letters of administra
tion.
Shortly after Fnie's death a deed was
filed for record in which all property; real
and personal, was left to the widow. It
was dated a week before his death. Pub
lic Administrator Kell in his petition de
clares his belief that W. B. Frue died in
testate leaving an estate worth more
than $10,000 and probably exceeding $1,000,
0U0. The estate consists of a large ranch
in Monterey County, real estate in Santa
Clara County and the State of Michigan
besides a large amount of stocks and
bonds. Mrs. Maud B. Frue, the widow
and a minor eon, Robert B. Frue are
named as the heirs. The petition has been
set for a hearing on- December 14 before
Judge Hyland.
It is said the deed made by Frue short
ly before his death will be attacked on'the
ground that he was not physically capa
ble of making it. A number of creditors
with unsecured debts are said to be inter
ested in the fight for the administration of
the estate. Mrs. Frue will resent the at
tempt of the Public Administrator, claim
ing thero is no estate of decedent,- as by
the terms of the deed it was all trans
ferred to her before his death.
WMlianvB. Frue was the son of "W B

LOS ANGELSS, Nov. 28.â The Los An

are preparing to head a revolt at Sacra
mento in January against the new Cutter
redistricting bill, and unless the rebellion
is nipped In the bud Senator Cutter's pet
â¢measure will have a hard, time reaching
the statutes. The southern members ol
both houses have already held one meet
ing on the subject, and another is sched
uled to take place at an early day. The
sentiment thus far has not been favcrable
to the boundaries upon which the pro
posed law is founded. The Los Angeles
members say they have not been consult
ed by any one upon the proposed legisla
tion, and they are opposed to any self
constltuted committee preparing such an
important piece of legislation in advance
without the advice or consent of those
whose votes will be needed to enact the
proposed bill into a law.
So far as Los Angeles is concerned, it
will be Insisted in Sacramento that this
county constitute by itself a Congression
al district, a concession that the rest of
the State probably will.be willing to make
to this section. Should such a division be
made Ventura, Santa Barbara and San

former counties added to what Is now the
Seventh District and the last named : to
one of the northern districts, which prob
ably would take in Inyo, Kern, Kings,
Tulare and Stanislaus, now a part of the
present Seventh District. Riverside; San

Trouble Results From the Death of a
Workman for Which the Yankees
Are Declared to Be
Responsible.
Pi>ec!al Dispatch to The Call.
PHOENIX, Nov. 28.â Pedro Garcia, a
Mexican residing here, has received a pri
vate letter from Guaymas bearing the
news that five Americans at the lime of
the writing were in jail and their live.3 in
jeopardy. In a small town some distance
soutfi of Guaymas, near the Sinaloa'ca
nal. They are charged with the killing of
a Mexican who, in reality, mot death a3
the result of an accident.
.The Americans have been friendly with
the Yaqui Indians, who are rumerous in
that section, and only the fear of the In
dians kept the Mexicans from killing the
Americans rather than imprisoning them.
The Yaquls in that vicinity are peace
able, but are prone to quarrel with the
Americans when gibed about their unsuc
cessful revolutions against the Mexican
Government.
The present trouble arose over atten
tions paid by the Americans to Mexican
renoritas. It Is said that about three
weeks ago one of the Americans had a
fight with a Mexican named Ramon, who
was employed in the same crew on con
struction work. The following day a der
rick dropped on Ramon, ; causing his
death. Two Americans, one of them
named Wells, were in charge of the der
rick, and the. Mexicans claimed that the
casualty was intentionally made possible.
Wells and his comrade explained that the
occurrence was purely accidental, but
their protests were useless, and the Mexi
cans, after filling up on native intoxi
cants, grew furious and announced their
intention of shooting at least the two men
in charge of the derrick. The Yaqui work
men thereupon sided with the Americans
and announced their intention of prevent
ing the shooting, even at the expense of
wiping out the Mexican portion of the vil
lage. The Mexicans weakened somewhat
in their threats and it has not been
learned here whether the Americans were
released or are still held captive and
awaiting trial.

the speed his crippled and exhausted con
dition would pt-rmit. Here he passed a

jagged edges of his desolate refuge. His
rigid lingers were welded to the rock. All
r.ight long the salt spray feil upon him.
sending 11s. chill to the marrow of hi?
bot.es. Occasionally great waves broke
ever the rock, beating the body of the un
fortun-ite man against its rough surface.
At 7 o'clock th:s morning passing Ital
ian fishermen took Aszevedo from the
rock more dead than alive and placed him
aboard a smack. I-ut-r they landed him
at the sandspit above Willow Camp,
v. i.cie a party of marchers removed him
LO his home.
Aszevedo. who lives about :i mile below
Willow Camp, launched his boat yester
day afternoon and started to collect some
planking that evidently had been washed
from the deck of some passing lumber
wssel. His quest carried him out a con
siderable distance from shore. In his de
sire to add to his lumber pile on the
beach he did not notice an approaching
squall.
From what could be learned from the
injured man, a heavy pea crushed n\$
boat against a larpe timber to which he
was trying to make fast. The boat was
wrecked and he was compelled to cling
to the tossing- timber for his life. It was
here that his shoulder was injured, and
he Fays that the pain more than once
nearly caused him to faint. The accident
occurred at 5 o'clock in the afternoon and
the timber to which he clung tossed about
on the sea until nearly 10 o'clock latt
night. lie says he thought that he was
miles out to f=ea when he floated under
the shadows of Moss Rock. It took him
a long time to climb Its slippery side. The
great timber that had saved his life
pounded and beat against the rock for
many hours and more than once threat
ened his life.
In the morning, througti the heavy fog,
the sound of a human voice fell upon his
ear. Too exhausted to sit erect or an
swer the call, he lay as one dead. Two
fishermen drew up under the rock and
soon had the unfortunate in their smack,
â¢where they did all that was possible for
him. Some dry clothing, a vigorous rub
binp cf his body and a little wine Jld
much to revive him. H< was taken to the
pandsprit above Willow Camp and turned
over to a party of searchers, who had
given him up for lost and were looking
for his body.
Aezevedo is in a precarious condition as
the result of his experience, and his re
covery is doubtful.

People who have used sprays, inhalers,

found how useless and Inconvenient they
are, "will be agreeably surprised at results
following the use of a pleasant, internal
remedy in tablet form; druggists every-

Dr. Ramsdell In commenting on catarrh

Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, because they
contain no cocaine nor other dangerous
drug found in so many advertised ca-
tarrh cures. I have known of many cases
of long standing catarrh of the head and
throat completely cured by the daily use
of these tablets for several weeks. One
cate in particular, which I could not
reach with an inhaler or epray and where
the catarrh caused daily headaches and
a noticeable loss of hearing was entirely
cured by this harmless but effective
remedy." .
Dr. Wainwrlght says: "iliever hesitate
to prescribe Stuart's Catarrh Tablets for
cataxrhal headaches and catarrhal deaf-

eafe for child or adult and have seen
many remarkable cures resulting from
their regular daily use; because they are

reason why any good physician should
not use them, because we should seize

Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are
valuable for catarrhal colds In children

Those of the Pacific Mail.
Secures Dock Facilities Adjoining
President Tweed of the Pacific Mail was
reticent to-day when asked about the pos
sibility of reaching an understanding with
the Panama Railroad. He said that It
was purely a question of making the best
use of their ships, a number of which have
been running to Central - American and
Mexican points. \
PANAMA COMPANY'S WHARF.
The Panama Railroad has partially ar
ranged for a 6teamship line of its own be
tween Panama and San Francisco. It has
chartered one steamship and is negotiat
ing for several more.
For traffic between the United j States
and Central American and Mexican points
and Europe and Central American and
Mexican points the Panama Railroad had
made working agreements with two dif
ferent steamship lines, and under this
agreement the latter will take the place of
the Pacific Mail Company In this traffic.
The business between New York and
Colon is now carried by vessels of the
Panama line, and this will continue at any
event. The steamship companies with
which the Panama Railroad has conclud
ed arrangements are understood to be the
Pacific Steam Navigation Company and
the South American or Chilean line, which
has already extended its service north
ward to Ban Francisco. Up to this time
they have stopped at Mexican points. Ac
cording to the terms now demanded by
the Panama Railroad, the Pacific Mail
Company will have to stand on the same
footing as the other steamship companies.
The officers of the Pacific Mail, on the
other hand, are not at all disturbed by the
preparations of the Panama Railroad.
They are preparing to strike back. If no
agreement is reached they could run
steamships into Guaymas, on the Gulf of
California, and there transfer traffic r to
the Sonora Railroad, which is controlled
by the Southern Pacific. Then the busi
ness would go by the Southern Pacific to
Galveston. whence it would be taken to
New York by the Morgan line. Mr. Hunt
ington for a long time had such a project
in mind, and, now that the Pacific Mail
Company Is controlled absolutely by the
Southern Pacific, it is possible that It will
be put into execution. The haul by rail
over the Southern Pacific would be more
expensive .than by water transportation
and if it came to a ratÂ© war the Panama
people think they would have the advan
tage.
On the other hand, the Southern Pacific
asserts the advantage of prompter deliv
ery. The merchants of California are in
terested in seeing a rival line started and
they prefer that the Panama Railroad
Bhould make a deal with other steamship
lines, so as to get as low rates as pos
sible. They are disposed to furnish capi
tal, If necessary, to establish a new
steamship company to connect with the
Panama Railroad.
NEW TORK, Nov. 29.â The Mail and
Express says: All signs point to a lively
fight between the Panama Railroad and
Pacific Mail Steamship companies after
the termination of their five-year agree
ment on December 16. The same difficul
ties have come up which confronted them
five years ago and there is little likelihood
of their Reaching an understanding.
The Panama Railroad, it is understood,
refused to give the Pacific Mail Company
the exclusive right, as against other
steamers, to traffic carried over, the isth
mus. The Panama Railroad also insists
on a larger share of revenue than it has
received under the old agreement.
The story of the Panama road with
drawing from its agreement with the Pa
cific Mail, the Southern Pacific entering
into the competition in transcontinental
freight, the Mail Company laying up three
of its steamers aaid the consequent gen
eral freight war has already been told.
The charter of the St. Paul and the secur
ing of wharf room by the Pznama Rail
road Company is only the latest phase of
the affair. ,
The Commissioners rejected all bids for
the treatment of piles to be used in the
construction of Berry-street wharf. . The
board decided that as the extension of tha
seawall was only the question of a year,
perhaps months, the use of piles specially
prepared was not necessary. Ordinary
piles will be used. , .
The railroad was offered the use of Lom
bard-street wharf, but refused, as the
wharf is not a grood place for an ocean
steamer to lay up at. Then the Alaska
Packers' Association came to the rescue.
It has little use for its wharf at Fremont
street during the winter months, and
President Fortmann when consulted
agreed to allow the railroad people to use
it until further orders. The rival lines
will thus be side by side for pome time to
come.

"Nothing new has happened in that re
spect. These two railroad companies arc
working harmoniously, but without any
alliance or agreement. . We hope that the
friendly relations now existing will con
tinue."
Asked about the report that a close mu
tuality of interest had been formed be
tween the Southern Pacific and the Union
Pacific railroads, Air. Tweedsald:
"I do not know anything: about a new
banking interest coming into this prop
erty. Certainly no. arrangements have
been made for tne sale of the Huntington
shares to any other interest. Those shares
are not for sale and so far as I am able
to judge at present, the Huntington hold
ings of Southern Pacific stocK will be
kept intact."
Charles H. Tweed, chairman of the
Southern Pacific directors and one of the
executors of Collis P. Huntington' s es
tate, said:
NEW YORK, Nov. 28.â In explanation
of. the activity of Southern Pacific Rail
way shares in the stock market, a rumor
was ; circulated to-day that a powerful
banking Interest not hitherto Identified
with the Southern Pacific nor with the
transcontinental railroad situation had
arranged to acquire either all or a large
part of the Huntingdon shares.

Who Also Says That an Alliance
Is Not Being Formed With

Mrs. H. K. 'Wheeler of 117 High Rock St..
Lynn, Ma^s., writes: "About IS months ag-o I
had a very severe cpell of sickness, I was ex-
tremely sick for three weeks, and when I
finally was able to leave ray bed I was left
with excruciating pain? in my back. My water
at times looked very like coffee. I could pass
but little at a time, and then only after suf-
fering great pain; My physical condition was
such that I had no strength and was all run
down. The doctors said my kidneys were not
affected, but I felt certain that they were
the cause of my trouble. My sister. Mrs. C.
E. lattlefleld; of Lynn advised me to KWe Dr.
Kilmer's Swamp-Root a trial. I procured a
bottle and inside of three days commenced to
get relief. - 1 followed up that bottle with an-
other, and at the completion of this one found
I was completely cured. My strength returned,
and to-day I am as well as ever. My business
Is that of canvasser, I am on ray feet a

MRS. H. K. WHEELER.
Many of the so-called female complaints
are nothlne Â¦Â»Â»*Â« but kidney trouble, or
the result of kidney or bladder disease.
Women Buffer as much from kidney and
bladder troubles as men do, which fact fs

doctor's services are nought he quickiy
comes to the conclusion that hers is an-
other case of female weakness or womb
trouble of some sort.
So when your kidneys are weak or oul
of order you can understand how quickly
your entire body is affected and how ev-
ery organ, seems to fail to do its duty.
If you are sick or "feel badly." begin

undisturbed in a glass or bottle for twen-

ance; if there is a brick-dust settling, or
if small particles float about In it. your
kidneys and bladder are in need of imme-
diate attention.
The great kidney remedy, Swamp-Root,
is pleasant to take, is used in the leading
hospitals, recommended by physicians m
their private practice, and is taken by
doctors themselves who have kidney ail-
ments, because they recognize in it the
greatest and most successful remedy for

Back of this prospective marriage Is a
romantic tale. At the time the Bloomfield
Rebekahs formally dedicated their new
lodge rooms, two months ago, ther agreed
that the first one of their members to get
married should be tendered an elaborate
wedding supper, by the lodge. On Thurs
day, evening the Bloomfield Rebekahs will
be called upon to pay. their debt
Miss Cockrill, who belongs to one of the
best connected families in the county, is a
first cousin of Miss Minnie Coulter, Sono

"While there is some evidence to indicate
that the new defender will carry a larger
amount of canvas than the Columbia, it
Is believed that the area of the Bails now
being made will not be much greater.
Another Important project is the adop
tion of all steel spars, with the exception
of the bowsprit and spinnaker pole. Tho
introduction of a steel topmast would be
a novel feature, especially if that spar
Is to be of the telescopic variety.
The oak frames for the keel mold were
shaped out three weeks ago, but are not
yet quite finished.
BRISTOL, R, I., Nov. 28.â Information as
to the new cup defender's hull was given
to-day at the Herreshoff shops. The keel
will not be laid for some weeks to come.
The date will conform to the completion
of the stiffening process of the hull of the
eeventy-f ooter Rainbow In the south shop.
There Is yet so much work to be finished
on this his sloop*that it will take about
four weeks to put her in shape for launch-
Ing. By that time the keel for the new
defender will be ready on the floor of the
ehop. The running of the lead keel will
come two days later, or on or about
Thursday, December 27. The working
plans for the new craft are being printed.
As regards the sails, that are now well
â¢begun, it has been thought that the grade
was a production of South Carolina, but
from the appearance of ravelings of the
canvas the head sails of the boat are sim
ilar to the mercerized Texas upland cotton
used In the makeup of the head sails of
the Columbia In 1899.
The Keel Will Not Be Laid
for Some Weeks to
Come.

The Board of Civil Service Commission
ers is coming in for a great deal of un
favorable criticism because of its delay
In marking' the â¢ papers of the applicants
who took the examination for experienced
clerkB in the Tax Collector's office. The
Commissioners take refuge for their dila
tory tactics in not announcing the result
of an examination which was held as far
back' as September 22, behind a request
made by Tax Collector Scott to postpone
the announcements. Scott's reason for
this singular request was that he was' in
the midst of his busiest season, when mil
lions of dollars were being collected In
taxes. He was averse, he said, to have
his clerks disturbed, while such large
amounts were being . paid in.

complied with Scott's request and Instead
of marking the examination papers for
Tax -Collector's clerks proceeded. to mark
those of the applicants for. positions of

ination was held at a later date than that

been finished In its order by the Civil Ser

The attention of the Mayor was directed
to the> delay in the compilation of the
ftiiarible list. His Honor directed his pri

matter. Fay learned the foregoing facts
and informed his superior to that effect.
The Mayor was satisfied with the explan
ation given. He was further informed
that the Police Commissioners had peti
tioned for an Immediate eligible list of po
lice officers as some thirty positions were
to be filled at once. That Is why the t>a
pers of the police applicants were marked
to the exclusion of those of the experi
enced clerks in the tax. office.

WHAT McKINLEY
WILL RECOMMEND
The second-hand clothing dealers of San
Francisco have formed an association and
will attack the constitutionality of the lo
cal ordinance which compels them to pay
a quarterly license taot. They have agreed
with Tax Collector Scott that an arrest be
made for the violation, in order that a
test case may be had. That arrest will
probably be made to-day. It is the inten
tion, of counsel for the clothing dealers
to consent to a conviction in the Police
Court, and on appeal to the Superior
Court to make the attack â¢ upon the con
stitutionality of the- ordinance.
The new charter provides in section 15,
page 55, .that "no license tax shall be Im
posed, on any person who at a nxr<l place
of business '. sells goods, wares,' or mer
chandise, except such as require permits
from the Board of Police Commissioners."
Section : 71, page 292, Â¦< decrees that the
"Chief of Police shall possess powers of
general police Inspection, supervision and
control over all * â¢â¢ â¢ dealers in second
hand merchandise and Junk-shop keepers.
All persons engaged in such callings must
procure permits from the CommisToners."
Under these sections, Ordinance No. 107
waa passed, placing a license tax upon
second-hand dealers varying from $4 to $3
per Â¦' quarter, Â¦ according .' to : the volume of
business transacted. The second-hand fur
niture dealers succeeded In getting ex
empted from the tax by the passage ol
Ordinance No. : 168. The second-hand
clothing dealers maintain that the license
tax involves an illegal discrimination.
They complain > that it is also unjust, as
they, are generally, small dealers and poor,
not as able to meet such a tax as mer
chants In general would be.

EDENBURGII, Orange River Colony.
Saturday. Nov. 24.â The Boers are most
active between the railroad and Basuto

and Bloe.mfontcin. General DÂ«wet and
former President Steyn are near Dewets
dorp. It Is believed they are preparing
for a descent of Cape Colony for recruitB
and supplies. As a counter-move two
battalions of the Guards. Grenadiers and
First Cold Streams hold all the fords of
the Orange Rover from Aliwal North to
the Orange River station. Small parties
of mounted Boers are able to cross the
river almost anywhere. The British have
great need of more mounted troops. Oth
erwise the" capture of Dewet is hopeless.
"The antl-Brltish feeling In Cape Col
ony is assuming dangerous proportions,
owing to false stories spread of British
barbarity In Orange River Colony and the
Transvaal. Loyalists fear that the Dutch
Congress next week will be the signal for
a rising and they demand that martial
law be proclaimed throughout the colony.
The situation Is declared to be graver
than at any previous time during the

were present and were entertained by a
programme of unusual interest. It consist
ed of musical, elocutionary and oratorical
selections. John P. Callaghan was the
poet of the flay and J. P. Plover was the
orator. The hall decorations were elab
orate. Festoons of flowers and greens
were draped about artistically among the
folds of national colors, which covered
the balconies and stage. Large American
flags were hung at intervals. The pro

The address of the orator of the day
was eloquent, the subject being "The Day
"We Are Celebrating. In the course of
his effort Mr. Plover said:
"The custom, which with us has grown
to be a national one. of appointing one
day in the year for general thanksgiving
to God. the giver of all good, is consonant
with the principles of our faith and the
promptings of the heart of a Christian
people. The duty of religious thanksgiv

Thanksgiving Brings Its Plenty to Mind

// /If there arises the
II III vision of. a well
V V JL\J> laid table Is a
7 question only cus-
Nr torn can answer.
It Is sufficient
that the two are
Inseparable, and that no Thanksgiving for
years back has brought a brighter "-vision
than this. The poultrymen will bear wit
ness that never before was the vice pres
idential bird in more demand, and a thou
sand vvni worked chimneys will attest be
tore the day Is over that Thanksgiving
lay Is something more than merely a day
of thanksgiving. .The eagle may scream
his loudest during the other 300 and odd
days, but on the last Thursday of No
vember he goes fishing and allows his un
derstufly an opportunity for honors.
The dinner is first only by length of ser
vice In San Francisco, however, for close
behind It comes the football game be
tween the two great colleges of the West.
For Eonw hours this afternoon the center
of the locaJ world will be contained in a
small oval of leather being ground into
the mud by twenty-two athletes, the pick
of the brawn of the two universities. And
around the field will be gathered all the
wealth and beauty and enthusiasm and a
Â£ood_part_of the noise of a cityful.
If the weather prophet Is to be believed
It will be a fair day. "with increasing
cloudiness in the afternoon, and at night."
If it will only remain fair enough for foot
ball the day will to a great extent have
served its end; and this Is not asking for
much, for all the players need Is a solid
footing at a depth anywhere below the
Fhoulder. and the audience will be satis
fied so long as the raindrops are not so
thick as to interfere with a good view of
the game.
The flower shops first showed the fes
tive reason, but they did not show It long.
Yesterday morning they blossomed out
like fairy bowers, arrayed in ail the gorg
eous colors of the Californlan fields and
g-arders. but by afternoon they looked like
a picture hat caught In the fog. Shelves
and vases were empty and the %plendld
blossoms had all been transferred to
places of safe keeping to await the com
ing of the day of prayer and plenty.
For the few who would sooner see some
eport other than football there will be the
races at Tanforan. a feature of which
will be the Autumn handicap, with a big
field of starters. And there will be cours
ing at Union Park and baseball at the
Eighth and Folsom street grounds. The
baseball will commence at half past 2, the
usual hour for the Sunday games. The
trame will bÂ« between the Stockton and
Oakland teams.
The Fruit and Flower Mission will ob
serve the day in its own fashion by feed
ing the hungry and bringing the holiday
cheer to homes where It Is but an Infre-
C^ent guest. More than two hundred
Thanksgiving dinners will have been dis
tributed before noon to-day, and very one
will have the bird for the head of the
table and the mince pie for the foo f .
Thanksgiving day is the time when tho
quiet charity of the mission blossoms
into more than almsgiving and caring for
the sick. It includes every one in the
piad autumn holiday, and sick and well
all come under its wing, bringing only
the pass word, "poverty," to help them
reach the hearts of the willing givers.
The grood cheer distributed by the mis
sion is made up partly of donations and
partly of what the mission purchases
with its own funds. For this occasion the
headquarters of the mission were found
to be too small for effective work and bo
the vacant flat at 723 Sutter street was
secured to house the well filled boxes un-

BERKELEY PROFESSORS
Novel Feature to B* Introduced in
the Show at the .
Tivoli.
The most interesting part of the per-
formance to "be given at the Tivoll
Thanksgiving night by the California stu
dents Is that devoted to the cartoons of
prominent students^ and members of the
faculty drawn by the best college artists;
Such pictures once went exclusively in
the annual Blue and Gold, but since fac
ulty supervision has been established the
boys have invented this novel way of run
ning: stereoptlcon and blograph pictures
in place of the Blue and Gold caricatures.
Influential students In Berkeley yester
day expressed the opinion that. some of
the artist* placed themselves In the same
precarious position as did the editors of
l&W's Blue and Gold, who suffered expul
sion.

Coach Yost, when seen last night, was in a happy mood and
had the following to say of his team:
"I have the greatest confidence in my squad both as a body
of men and as a team. The boys have a good knowledge of the
game and are In the spirit to put up the best, fight that is In
them. .1 have never seen a more willing, patient or conscien
tious set of fellows in my life, and I am sure the college! will
have a right to feel proud of them to-morrow night. .The team
work has greatly Improved during the last few days until now
the men can go through a series of difficult plays without a
hitch. I am somewhat worried over the condition of some of
the men who have been Injured In the recent practices, but
trust they will come out all right under Dr. Murphy's care. I
feel confident we will win over Berkeley to-morrow and by a
good score. By this I do not mean to Imply that we have a
walkover, for we haven't, nor do we expect one. I base my
assertion on the fact that Stanford's Is a scoring team. How
ever, the California team may .score also, but I think not so
often as the cardinal."
Yost Is Satisfied That Cardinal
Eleven Will Win Out.
B. Silvia's clever grephound Reannex
captured the midweek reserve stake at
Union Park yesterday, beating Erskine &
Jones' Lavender pointless in the deciding
round. Both dogs rial good work through
out the stake, though the runner-up was
well worn when she was brought to the
slips for the final. On three occasions
Lavender won on the short end. getting
the flag from Rest Assured at 5 to 4 in the
second round, and beating P. J. Reilly's
fast ones, The Grafter at 2 to 1 and Royal
Union at 5 to \. in the fourth and fifth.
The last course was too much for the
game little one, and try as she would she
could not score against her better condi
tioned opponent. Reannex had all the
work that was coming to her, but re
sponded In good shape. Twice she took
the decision from favorites, Minnie Wa
Wa at 5 to 3 and Sisquoc at 2 to 1.
It was a good day for the pikers. In all
twenty upsets being recorded. In the run
down Ben's Babe 6eat Olita at 6 to 1.
Lady Davenport beat Best Bargain at 4 to
1. Cash beat Liberator and Cotton Ball
beat Lilac at 5 to 3. Rest Assured beat Sir
Pasha, Bonnie Pasha beat Belle Claire
and NIcasio beat Lyddite at 2 to 1.
In the second round Miss Penman beat
Santonin and Scottish Chief beat St. An
thony at o to S. and Montana Jack beat
Betsy Barrow at 3 to 1. Sleety MlÂ»t beat
Cash at 2 to 1, Faithful Lad beat Ever
Sure at 3 to 1 and Royal Union beat For
Glory at 5 to 3 In the third round. The
favorites failed to show in the fourth.
Belle Claire beat Royal Union In a bye
at 5 to 2 and Lady Davenport won from
Sleety Mist at the same odds. Iowa Maid
beat Virginia Girl in a one-sided go. The
latter was slipped for the first time and
refused to follow the game.

BERKELEY. Nov. 2<v_Thc prospects
for Berkeley appear much brighter than
they did twenty-four hours ago. The men
are in hearty spirits. Although not over
confident, they will enter the game to
morrow with a k^cn sense of their own
Ftrength and ability and with^a do or dio
determination. /
Signal practice was held this evening.
Tbe men did their work in splendid shape,
playing remarkably 'fast ball. Hudson
was in line. His arm has improved great
lv during the last twelve hours and he
will be able to take his place at left end.
Captain Pringle' s knee has ceased to give
alarm The manner in which he got over
the ground in practice this evening shows
that lhere is nothing serious the. matter
will be unable to act as substi
tute left end. The ligaments were torn
from his ankle during practice yesterday
and he is now on crutches./ Premo s In-
jured knee has not proved serious and he
will substitute at that position. Berke
ley's two big guards. Overall and Clay,
are responsible for the injuries of Dlb
blee and Premo. â¢ It Is rather a. painful
illustration of the smashing ball these two
men play even against a second eleven.
They are both hard men to stop when in
motion.
Berkeley's left end Is acknowledged -to
b^ weak. The coaches feH, however, that
this is no serious drawback to the general
standard of the team, for Stanford's op
posing team is equally as weak.
C. A. Pringle. '-apta'in of the team, paid
to-night: "The team we have is the best
that could be picked. The line is strong
nnd. If It plays at -Its best should hold
Stanford. The backs are working togeth
er well and will yield no advantage to
Stanford. We shall play ball from start
to finish. We shall not be stampeded and
It Is quite needlfss to say that there Isn't
a aruitter In the eleven. Certainly a truer
and more willing set of men never went

Kelly Is Not So. Sanguine, but
Expects to Be on Top.
Coach Addlson W. Kelly said last night: "Tho training this
year has been directed toward the perfection of the offense.
Our defense has been stronger and could stand lack of attn
tion more than our offense. We Tiave had to make so many
changes that bur team work has been hindered. We have also
had to play our old varsity men tco much.
"I am satisfied though with the team, as It stands. It will
Â»glve a good account of itself to-morrow. Much more than this
I do not care to say. It is far better to leave prejudgment
alone. The game to-morrow will be the test. As far as the
I playing of the men goes I have every reason to believeâ in fact.
I know Itâ that there will be no shirkers wearing ,the blue and
gold colors. The practice during the last few days has been
brisk and full of ginger. It showed the possibilities of the
team's play. *
"The Injury to our left end came at a most Inopportune time.
And this ill luck seems to have hit California on several occa
sions during the season. The team as it stands is the best that
we could get/together. Of course I think we will win."
COLLEGIANS AT BERKELEY ARE
HOPEFUL.

and to-day may be in shape, the line of

Clay, Albertson and Hudson or Williams,
bears the earmarks of greenness, still the.
men have evinced a deal of dash ana
spirit in the late practice games. Al Lean,
who at the eleventh hour has taken
charge of some of the varsity injured,
says that Captain Pringle will last tnÂ«?
entire game. Clay and Cornish are fit
after illness. Womble is at right end and
is playing a game of high standard, but
less a little of the old-time sureness, ow
ing to the worry caused by the field cap
tain's duties. The feeling among the Cal
ifornia players Is much, the same as at
Stanford. The fine work of the team dur
ing the past week has put plenty of con
fidence Into the menâ the same normal,
safe confidence.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Nov. 2S.â
To-night the Stanford team Is well pre
pared for to-morrow's contest, and neither
coach nor players have any complaints to
make. The men spent a comparatively
quiet day. ' At 9 o'clock this morning Yost
had the men on the field, and for two
hours kept them busy running signals
and smoothing off the rough places. The
formations were close and quick. There
was practically no fumbling, which shows
that Quarterback Raitt has attained hlj
usual good form. The work of the for
wards was "especially pleasing. The men
showed more dash and vim than at any
time during the season. Traeger. De For
est and Seeley are In the best of physical
shape. Burnett's wrenched knee has ma
terially improved during the last twenty
four hours and it now looks as if he would
be able to last the game out. Centerrush
Lee, who has been troubled with a. like
Injury, is also much better and will be
seen In the first line-up. McFadden and
PALO ALTO TEAM IS WELL
PREPARED FOR BATTLE.
Cooper will line up on the ends, with
Stanford and Luck ready to go in at any
stage of the game should a change be
deemed necessary. Back of the line the
cardinal will be represented by a quartet
of fast backs. Raitt is conceded the best
quarter on the coast. wKile Slaker at full
lit one of Walter Camp's choices for all-
America honors. Hill and Erb will play
the halves. Both are strong defensive
players and run strong with the ball.
The men were gathered In a close room
this afternoon, where Coach Yost lectured
them on the game.
The team will leave Palo Alto In a spe
cial car attached to the Monterey flyer
On reaching the city they will be taken
directly to the Y. M. C. A. Club building,
where dressing rooms with showers have
been provided. They will lunch early at
a downtown cafe and leave early for the
grounds In a special car at 2 o'clock. The
students will have a special train leaving
the campus at 8:30. bearing the university
band and rooters. The college band will
give a concert in the lobby of the Palaca
Hotel at 11 o'clock.
AFTER taking the given facts of the
situation at both colleges and
running them through the sieve
of unprejudlce, the consensus of
opinion seems to be that the
game of to-day will be very closely con
tested. It is the seemingly logical deduc
tion that the match will not be as one
sided an affair as those of recent years.
Both teams have scoring possibilities and
besides both sides will not run up against
an Impregnable defense, Stanford has
shown superior offensive form during the
season, notably in the 44 to 0 game with
Reliance, but her strength in this direc
tion has been dissipated somewhat during
the past week by having the setting of
varsity men jumbled about where a num
ber of substitutes took the places of
bruised and injured varsity men. Further,
mere especial attention has been given to
the weaker defensive play than to the of
fensive, and with the season's actual grid-
Iron practice over, head coach. and assist
ants do not feel that anything like a per
fect system of resistance has been
reached. Summed up, the opinion amonp
the well-informed Stanford followers of
football is that the eleven will balance
fairly well In all departments of the game,
that it will display the heavy scoring abil
ity brought out three weeks ago, but re
cently of rather a latent nature, and last
ly that the players who compose the
varsity have the safe, normal amount of
confidence and good spirit and a realiza
tion that they are to meet a worthy grid
iron foe in the men of the blue and gold.
A prominent member of the varsity stated
yesterday that the group of players as a
unit felt that success lay in getting the
jump on California in the first ten min
utes of play. This the men expect to do,
and as, a result of it to secure a victory
by a close margin. The men further say
that the reports of betting of two to one
and ten to six in Stanford's favor had not
engendered a feeling of overconfldence
among them. They consider that they
have an equal chance to win as conditions
present themselves now, the advantage to
be determined during the game and not
before.
California's team has made a fast finish.
Of that there is no doubt. Three weeks
ago the team on form was robbed of a
hope of victory. More, at quarterback,
and Captain Pringle are back In the game
to stay. Gammon proved v find at left
half and materially strengthens the back
Held power of attack. Overall Is sup

"Bet? Why bet 10-6 until you destroy
the national credit? McKinley would be
a poor 'placer' in a dual meet alongside
this team. Thanksgiving night wilt be a
warm one for Stanford. Say. I really feel
bad for that combination color. Well. It's
only getting even. They rubbed It Into us
the last two years. The year 1900 will be
a football glory for the cardinal. That's
all there is to it."
"What did you say about Burnett's knee
and Seeley's ribs? Oh, they are all right,
as you will find out to-morrow. The. knee
is strong and the floater Is anchored. No
matter, we can't lose lor this very reason
â Stanford is stronger on the offense than
California, and just as strong on the de
fense. Stanford's line is more mucilagin
ous than California's. The cardinal backs
are 1 as good as the blue and gold's. Stan
ford's team will outweigh California's.
And â there you are.
field something of the avalanche order Is
going to happen. Then Hill ajid Erb and,
the mighty Slaker. all coached with Raitt.
the passer and. team general, will tear
holes in California's line big enough to
send ships through. But that Isn't all.
There's Traeger and De Forrest and Mc-
Fadden, Lee. Burnett Â«nd Cooper, all the
best in their kind and in good enough
physical condition to last two games.
Well. I guess I've named eleven world
beaters, and Isn't It strange they are on
one team?
WELL, this is like the old-time
cardinal years," shouted the
deep-dyed Stanford support
er. "Did you ever see any
thing like it? Before the sun
sets to-morrow there will be a lot of sorry,
peaked faces from Berkeley In this town,
and all the gold In seven kingdoms will be
covered with ultramarine.
"Now. I'll prove to you In a min
ute that California hasn't a chance
in the world. First, look at the
Reliance games. Did California ever
pile up forty-four points In a single
game? Why. the blue and gold team
hardly scored that many all season. And
it was done with ease. too. No. you can't
get away from it this year; it's so easy
it would be a shame for Yost to tell his
men to play before the game begins.
"What do you say about that Nevada
game? Oh, that's explained in a minute.
Every team goes wrong one day In a sea
son. That time was Stanford's when the
cardinal met the Xevadans. But there
has been such a recovery from that epilep
tic shock that Stanford to-day is a tower
of strength.
"Where Is there another Just like Seeley?
When he gets the ball and goes down the

others' faces in doing it either. If Stan
ford is going to get any advantage which
will put Berkeley on the short end at
10 to 6. it will not be the fault of her leti;
gimrd. Clay.
"Bull" Albertson weighs but ISO pounds.
He has for his opposing tackle "Bab""
Burnett, the pet and idol of the men of
Stanford, who weig'hs twenty pounds
more, and has a good head to profit by
his three years of play. But it is admit
ted by all that gritty and brave as "Babe"
is. his injured knee may be too much for
him. and flesh will fail where his spirit
would drive.
Between the two other ends. Hudson.
Berkeley's left, and Cooper on Stanford's
right, there is no such apparent difference
as would account for the frightful attack,
of chilblains from which the blue and
gold are suffering, even if Cooper does
weigh twenty pounds more.
Coming to the backs, who have to bo
all over and fight the whole field if need
be. there appears to be still an even thing
of it. for Stanford is certainly under a
handicap by reason of the interruption in
the work when Raitt was called away.
Johnnie More, quarterback of the blue
and gold team, has a bad knee. Taking
those two men in the balance together, al
though not directly opposed to each other,
there might be a small advantage in favor
of Stanford, but in the halfbacks this is
certainly countered by "Locomotive"
Smith, as valued with his namesake "Pie"
Smith or Billy Erb, who in his wild
dodge? has sometimes risked carrying
the ball backward in order to get around
interference, even at the risk of losing
many precious yards. "Locomotive"
Smith has no weak points that a Berke
ley man, or any one else for that matter,
could point out, unless possibly he may
have suffered a little from * excessive
i training, but the rest and light signal
1 work of the last few days should have
cured that defect.
Duden. Berkeley's fullback, is the best
figure of any man on the field. Slaker of
Stanford has a bad rib. Gammon of Cali
fornia is surprisingly fast, and- In the very
place where, according to the make-up
of the team, his work will count to the
best advantage. Stanford's half. Hill,
was out last year but is playing well.
The very erratic . variations of form
which both teams have shown in their
play with visitors cannot be taken as of
any value in forecasting. Particularly is
that the case in the Stanford-Reliance
game at Stanford, when only two of the
Reliance men were in perfect condition
and the score was a fright.
To sum up. the lines are about equal:
the quarters are balanced, with the
chances in favor of Raitt. The ends com
pared give Berkeley a decided advantage.
Her splendid interference is enough cer
tainly to offset any.advantage which Stan
ford might gain from mass plays on weak
points.

Just to show you that yon are wrong they

If Berkeley is lacking by a hairs weight
in the balance, no one has yet discovered
it.. ' . . . Â¦
Here is the way they stack up against
each other:
To begin with there Is "Wreck" Womble
en Berkeley's right end, who weighs in
his football armor 105 pounds and has
had three years' successful play, which
should give him the heart and confidence
that makes a man three times a mart
when the time of need comes. Opposed to
him there is the uncertainty of McFad
df-n r,r Luck, for McFadden may. at the
laÂ«=t minute, be recalled to take Burnett's
place, in case the big "Babes" knee gives
out under his 200 pounds weight. McFafl
den has had but two years" play and if
he is compelled to leave his place it must
be filled by Luck of the second team, who
Is doing first year's work and might rea
sonably be expected to lack the confidence
and experience which mean so much un

Captain Pringle. Berkeley's right tackle,
has ISO pounds weight and four years of
creditable play â plenty of "front" to put
up against Traeger. Stanford's left tackle,
who has an equal weight but two years
lefs of experience.
The "Giant" Overall is a new man. but

eo fierce his play that it will b*- a wonder
if he t? not the "mogul" of football en

pounds lighter to offset his two years of

can equal Berkeley's rignt. f

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
On the other side it is.argued that while the Senate
can purge itself from a membership obtained through
improper methods, it would unduly stretch its power
should it undertake to say that the man denied mem
bership in one instance shall not attain it thereafter
even if there be no charge of bribery in the second
instance. It is claimed that if a man guilty of'pro
curing an election to the United States Senate by
bribery is to be disqualified forever, the disqualifica
tion should be the result of State action and not by
an arbitrary act of the Senate itself.
Of course no one has at this time any information
One authority says it is very probable a majority
of the Senators will hold that disqualification oh ac
count of bribery cannot be evaded by^a resignation
clearly Intended for the purpose of escaping condem
nation, and that having been disqualified once upon
that ground the offender cannot afterward become
eligible. It is further argued- that the case against
Clark is the stronger because it is certain that in the
last campaign he spent more money to procure an
election than he ever did before.
A QUESTION of considerable nicety is engag
ing the attention of political experts in Wash
ington in connection with the case of Mr. Gark
of Montana. It will be remembered that when that
distinguished statesman presented his credentials at
the last session of Congress a fight was made against
him; it was alleged he had. obtained his election by
briber)', and a committee was appointed to investigate
the charges. The committee reported that the
charges had been sustained, but before the Senate
took any action upon the report Clark resigned. It is
row fairly certain he will be re-elected, for he has the
Montana Legislature in the hollow of his hand. The
question is .whether the Senate will admit him on his
new credentials or /eject him because he has once
been 'found guilty of bribery.

Editorial Opinion From All Parts of the State
on Matters of Interest.
We are thus promised wireless telegraphy across
the Atlantic within the coming year. Truly Marconi's
invention moves rapidly. * "
Signor Marconi's infinite capacity for taking pains has
enabled him to construct on apparatus whereby he can
lengthen the air waves to an almost unlimited extent.
Furthermore, by the same ingenious device sound will
be made to travel close to the surface of the ocean 'over,
the whole ' distance, thus circumventing the dreaded
difficulty, presented by the curvature of the, earth.
Hence the masts erected at Southampton and on Long
Island need not. it is now contended, be higher than the
roof cf a New York skyscraper.
It will be seen the only ( objection to wireless tele
graphy for general use at present is the lack of speed
in transmitting messages. It is certainly not too much
to expect improvements will be shortly made which
will overcome that defect. The question of long dis
tance telegraphing seems virtually settled, according
tc the London correspondent of the New York Her
ald, whose dispatch of yesterday stated:
It seems highly probable that before long the various
channel steamboat companies will, be licensed by the
postofflce to make use of wireless telegraphy Installa
tions as a means of communication between the different
vessels and the shore. Regarding its general adoption
on land, however, it is pointed out that the present
"wire" systetm is capable of far greater Bpeed than is
possible .with the Marconi apparatus. The latter does
not appear to be capable of transmitting more than
eight or ten words a minute, whereas the Wheatstone
instrument at present used by the telegraph department
transmits from 200 to 300 words in the same time. If
the Marconi system could do this the postofflce would
be only too glad to get rid of all its present wires.
We directed attention a short time ago to experi
ments made by the British postoffice authorities for
the purpose of determining whether they could profit
ably make use of wireless telegraphy in the postal
telegraph system. The results of the experiments, it
appears, have not. been altogether satisfactory. The
London Chronicle, in giving an account of them,
The latest reports are to the effect that certain
experiments made by Marconi demonstrate an, ability
to telegraph without v/ires over distances so vast that
the inventor deems himself on the verge of accom
plishing the feat of sending messages across the,At
lantic. Such a feat would not be more remarkable
than what he has already achieved, for since a method
has been devised for sending dispatches through the
air, over mountains and in the midst of storms, for
a distance of fifty miles, the extension of the dis
tance is a mere matter of increasing the force of the
radiant energy at the point of discharge.
P\A ARCONI'S improvements in wireless teleg
/ \ raphy continue to furnish some of the more
important items of the news of the day. The
man is a tireless worker and is rapidly extending the
powers and perfecting the methods of his invention.
So far has he progressed that there are now reaUy
valid reasons for believing that within a compara
tively few years wireless telegraphy may almost com
pletely supersede telegraphy by wire.
MARCONI'S IMPROVEMENTS.
There is no reason as yet to abandon the hope that
the new management of the Southern Pacific will take
the corporation out of politics. Still, we must not
trust too much to that hope. Mr. Herrin's activity
continues to be more pernicious to the State than
beneficial to the railroad company. The Republicans
of California can beat him, however, if they set them
selves resolutely to the task. He was beaten in the
last Legislature in his effort to elect a disreputable
tool of the railroad to the United States Senate. He
was beaten at the last election in his efforts to defeat
men who had opposed him in the Senatorial
fight, and also in his efforts to elect some
of the most notorious of the railroad gang to
the Legislature. From those victories of ihe past
the people can draw omens of victories to come, pro
vided they be equally resolute in fighting for them.
The issue is worth meditating upon, even on Thanks
giving day. We can take no chances with the tire
less, astute and unscrupulous men who are now
scheming to defeat the popular demand for a primary
law in the interest of honest politics.
A valid primary law, drawn in such a way as to
prevent the frauds that were committed in the pri
maries at the last election, is an essential to good
government in California. There is no other way
by which honest men can have a chance to control
party conventions and assure the nomination or
worthy men for every office at stake. Such a law must
be framed by men who desire honesty. The tools of
the bosses and the lawyers of the railroad will not
fisnie that kind of law. Either they will so frame
the act as to maintain the power of the bosses, or
else they will deliberately embody in it some uncon
stitutional provision, so as to have it killed by the
courts on the eve of the next election.
There is danger ahead of the primary law. *As was
announced yesterday, information has been received
by The Call that a lawyer well known in politics is
row engaged in framing a bill for a primary law and
has been in frequent consultation with \V. F. Her
rin, of the Southern Pacific Railroad, on the sub
ject. Unless Hcrrin has received orders from the
new Tsj.:iagers of the Southern Pacific to change his
political methods, his interest in the law is certainly
not going to be on the side of honesty. The man
who brought Kelly and Crimmins back to power in
city politics, who sought to procure Dibble's re
election to the Legislature, and who profited so much
by the wide-open primaries of the year, is not 'likely
to favor a law which will give honest men a fair
chance in the primaries. Consequently the report that
he is being consulted on the terms of the proposed
law is enough to warn good citizens to be on their
guard.
ONE of the events of the year for which good
Caiifornians will not give thanks to-day is the
action of the Supreme Court in overthrowing
the primary iaw; and consequently one of the things
for which they will give thanks is that they may have
a new law enacted by the Legislature this winter.
When thanks are given on that score, however, they
should be accompanied by a resolve to watch the is
sue closely and to see to it that when the time comes
for action the Legislature shall provide a law in the
interest of honest politics, and not in that of the
Losses.
PRIMARY LfJW PROBLEMS.
Mr. Hughes once successfully exhibited at the Cat Show a Bowery cat, de
scribed with a bogus pedigree, which took first prize. He has perpetrated various
other jokes which have received much publicity.
"After the mare looked presentable I had my daughter ride her and get her
accustomed to the saddle. I found it difficult to break Puldeka from starting
whenever a bell rang, and at first it was almost impossible to get her to go ahead
any other way. .
' "The judges and veterinary surgeons made their preliminary examination and
decided Puldeka was a fit steed to compete with the other high-class horses. This
is in Itself a great victory. Think of It! An old skate of a car horse officially
Judged to be an animal of class high enough to compete at the National Horse
Show."
"I had her properly fed," Mr. Hughes said, "and consulted a veter
inary surgeon as to the best way of developing her best qualities. We gave her a
r tonic pill consisting of strychnia, dlalyzed iron and arsenious acid. This pill Pul
' deka took regularly, and the 'way she took on sleekness and flesh was marvelous.
I hired a groom especially for her and told him if he could get Puldeka in such
shape as to win a prize half of the money should be his.
The story of Puldeka Orphan dates back to last September when Mr. Hughes
bought her for $1150 and sent her to his country place at Brlchton. There with
proper feeding the animal showed marked improvement, and Mr. Hughes decided
to bring her up to the Horse Show standard.
None of the true blue thoroughbreds received half the attention and outer
show that graced the quarters of the car horse. Puldeka was ridden for inspec
tion by Miss Clara Hughes, Mr. Hughes' 18-year-old daughter, who recently grad
uated from a convent, where she was valedictorian. She has inherited her fath
er's love of a Joke. ,
deka Orphan and have been none the wiser. The old car horse was stalled in No.
603. Mr. Hughes spared no expense in decorating her stable.' It was covered on
each side with red velvet. Chrysanthemums, roses and lilac were decked about
the walls. AH evening two grooms in full livery stood at either Bide of the stall.
-So completely had Mr. Hughes carried out his plans that after the exhibition
the Judges were still unaware of the trick perpetrated on them. He succeeded in
placing as his entry in competition for a prize against the highest class horses In
the country a steed which formerly romped in front of a Fifty-ninth street cross
town car from East to North River.
Thousands who have toured the stalls at the Horse Show have looked on Pul-
won no prize.
PULDEKA ORPHAN," brushed and combed from ears to fetlock, proudly
strode onto the tanbark at the recent New York Horse Show in company
of twenty-five equally well-groomed thoroughbreds competing for blue rib
bon honors in the saddle class. A glance at the catalogue showed the fol
lowing entry: "Puldeka Orphanâ by Metropolitan, dam Electricity." Had
the Judges read slowly, says a writer in the New York World, they might have
noticed that Puldeka Orphan is in rhythm very like "pulled" a car often" and
have learned that ranker counterfeit never figured in a horse trade than "Pul
deka Orphan," reincarnation of a car horse and relic of the Metropolitan Street
Railway Company before electricity took the place of horse motive power.^
. Brian G. Hughes, practical Joker, had foisted Puldeka Orphan on the Horse
Show managers, fooled a credulous public and scored another jokei But his horse
PROSPERITY in America will be the theme of
ten thousand discourses to-day; and there may
be on the part of some a suspicion that we are
overrating our greatness and exaggerating the
wealth our industry t our enterprise and our thrift have
developed from the rich resources of our matchless
country. It is, therefore, worth recalling that^ our
progress has been noted abroad as well as at-home,
and that it is not patriotism only that causes us to
exult. The facts justify our enthusiasm and our jubi
lation. Foreign authorities as well as thefsc in our
own land have noted our progress with admiration.
The London Economist in a recent review of the
financial and industrial situation of the United States
said:
Never has the American nation possessed so much
accumulated wealth ready to flow Into any enterprise
of promise. Never have her industries been so well able
to meet competition in the home and In the world's mar
kets. Never has the production of. her mines been so
great. Xever have -her farms- produced more valuable
crops of cereals and cotton, nor the farmers possessed
more numerous and more valuable flocks and herds.
Never have the railroads been- able to transport her
'products and people more economically, expeditiously
and profitably, and we may add that never have the
railroads been so strong, both physically and financially,
as they are now. Whatever form new enterprise may
take, that there will be an outburst of it is reasonably
certain, bearing in mind how great the savings of the
country have been during the last four years and how
little outlet there is for investment profitably of thoso
savings outside American jurisdiction. Within the
United States' itself and in Its new colonies acquired
from Spain there are, on the other hand, almost bound
less opportunities for profitable Investment, and there
fore an outburst of new enterprise is to be looked for
as almost inevitable.
As to our political condition and prestige as a world
power, Sir Robert Giffen, statistician of the London
Beard of Trade, said a few days ago:
If we consider that an empire like that of Britain
has its strength rathex diminished than increased by the
possession of territories like India, then the United
States, having a larger European population than that
of the Eritish empire, may be considered the most pow
erful state in the world as far as population and re
sources are concerned. No doubt Russia has a much
larger population, but the inferiority of the units is so
great that the pre-eminence of the United States is not
in question. Germany, Russia and the United Kingdom,
have all grown, while France and Austria have oy com
parison remained stationary, so that now the great
world powers are four only, the United States, Britain,
Russia and Germany, With France a doubtful fifth.
Those quotations may serve as examples of what is
thought and said of us by students of economic and
political questions abroad. Many more might be
quoted from all civilized lands and from authorities
of almost all kinds. We stand to-day the richest and
the strongest of the powers of earth, and, moreover,
every prospect promises greater prosperity and
greater power in the years to come.

In the midst of it all, let not man debase himself
as a poor worm of the dust. He is the prince oi
creation. After he reached self-consciousness he con
quested the material universe by self-development of
his own faculties. The ox nips the herbage now as he
did on the plains of Shinar. The bird nests as she
did in the cedars of Lebanon and the spider spins
his web no more cunningly than he did in the willows
that grew by the waters of Babylon. But man,
princely man, no longer houses in a cave and wears
the skins of beasts. His genius has woven garments,
invented the arch, planned truss and buttress and
pilaster. It has harnessed the expansion of steam,
made rivers toil for him, compelled the earth to
change its yield to nourish him, and all along his
path change and progress are written, even in the
ruins he has made in his march from darkness to
light. So, let us be thankful, hopeful and of good
chÂ«er; love our families and our fellows in the great
world's work; lift up the lowly and cheer the disin
herited. The world is good, and if it be the begin
ning of a cycle of worlds and of existences, let us get
our share of it, and be thankful, before we pass on.
So, looking around us upon what has been by our
growing knowledge of natural law, the heart of man
swells with pride and gratitude and the elements of
his spirit of thanksgiving are the same simple senti
ments that made the shepherd kings give thanks for
the fruitful overflow of the Nile, and the red men
lift their hands and hearts to an unseen power in
gratitude for the coming of the buffalo.
The people of the United States have special cause
for thanksgiving every year. Given the richest of all
the continents, productive of everything required by
man's material wants, and having the potency of that
wealth, beyond the necessities of existence, which en
ables the satisfaction of refined tastes, the patronage
of art, the development of literature and pursuit of
science, they are by destiny the most fortunate of all
the nations that have enjoyed the earth and the full
ness thereof. Within the wide borders of this land
is every variety of climate that man can seek to be at
one with physical conditions and in harmony with his
environment. We have the moist, the dry, the level
and the rugged, the low coasts and the great moun
tains that lift their helmet-clad summits to the sun,
challenging the tempest to battle.
We have the capacity for every industry that man
follows for supply of his daily wants and the gaining
of riches. With this surpassing physical endowment
it is not wonderful that here we have the latest, the
broadest and the best application of science to art
that is to be found in the world. Time was that the
distribution of power from the falls of the Rhine at
Schaflfhausen, using wire ropes and pulleys, was a
marvel. Now we excel the world in deriving power
from our water courses and sending it on electric
wires so far that by curvature of the earth the great
rim of the planet rises between its source and the light
it. sheds or the machinery it actuates. Bringing to
bear the resources of science upon the inchoate wealth
of our country, one man. touches a button and ac
complishes more than 10,000 men could do in the age
of the pyramids and the sphinx.
The human race, the greatest manifestation of evo
lution, the refined product of creative force, subject
ing all things unto it r.nd given dominion and power
over all things else in the material world, moved upon
by the spirit of gratitude for its position and its power,
yet" bows its head to the unseen law by which its pri
macy is made useful, through the multitude of the
animate and inanimate, given to it to rule and to use.
None can know but what man shares this "grateful
heart with the beasts of the field and the birds of the
air, which utter themselves in tongues not known to
us and. may take.thought in common with man.
Our red races had ceremonies expressive of grati
tude, for the bounty with which nature sustained their
simple lives. The presence of the beaver and the
otter, the deer and wild fowl, supplying skins and fur
for clothing and meat for food, was acknowledged by.
Pequod and Narragansett on the cold New England
coast. Sioux, Blackfoot and Omaha welcomed the
coming of the buffalo, and when the great herds re
tired to winter in the valley of the Arkansas and on
the plains of New Mexico, in the soft Indian summer
of the Dakotas and Minnesota and Nebraska, the
red children of God offered thanks for the season and
its abundance of meat and robes gathered against the
blear northern winter and its needs.
TO give thanks to whatever force protects and
preserves man has been instinctive in the human
race in all ages and nations. In'our high civili
zation the giving of thanks takes on a refined/ethical
form and joined to the religious idea is ornate with
sonorous ritual and impressive ceremony. But at
base it is just the same feeling that moves the light
hearted Japanese to celebrate the safety of the crop of
rice, and the Chinese to give thanks for the generous
yield of good tea. Thanksgiving was in this
land long before a white man trod its coasts or pene
trated its vast continental spaces. There are relations
between all life, brute and human and organic and
inorganic. The same great statutes of natural law are
over it and in it all.

To use a homely expression, the Demo

true of the past, there are now few States

of "The Winter's Tale" wa3 to make a
comedy plot of It. Jealousy Is to bÂ© the
main motive, injustice and brutality are
to follow upon it: but the wife who is
killed in Greene's story will only appear
to be dead in Shakespeare's version, and
will come to life afterward; and the hus
band (who ln Greene'3 story becomes a
victim of his own remorse; Is finally
united with his wife and family and they
all live Ion?? and happily. Another change
Shakespeare makes in the relations of the
characters to the countries In which they
live. Sicily and Bohemia are retained for
the scenes^ but the Jealous husband in
Greene's novel lives In Bohemia, while in
Shakespeare he lives in Sicily. A gain is
made here, for the effect of wildnesa and
remoteness ln the region where the child
Is exposed is much Increased. Shakes
peare is criticized for referring to Bohe
mia in the play as accessible to ships; as
a matter of fact he merely follows
Greene, who states that the "Kin* of
Sicily provided a navle of ships and saylctl
into Bohemia." As late, indeed, as 1620
an Alderman of London did not know that
a fleet of ships could not enter a port of
Bohemia, yet no one thought the mistake
unusual. Seacoast or no eeacoast, Bohe
mia, for the purpose of the play, satisfies
the demands for remoteness and wild
ness better than the seas round Sicily.
The discussion of seac6asts in Bohemia Is,
then, rather idle; one may fancy that the
poet was too much concerned with the
romantic BUggestlveness of the mere
name of the region to look it up. Bohemia
meant far. indefinite things, like many
proper names ln Milton.
Few of Shakespeare's plays enable us
to see the poet's method of work as well
as does "The Winter's Tale." Roughly,
the story from which he drew runs as fol-
Pandosto. King of Bohemia, ana* hlÂ»
Â¦wife, Bellaria. entertain Eglstus, King of
Sicily, an old friend. Bellaria and the
guest get on very well together, and, in
deed, their relations were marked by
"honest familiarity." It occurs to Pan
dosto that they are. Indeed, too familiar
and too obviously honest; and he begins
to nurse suspicion and Jealousy. Jeal
ousy naturally tlnds reasons for suspicion;
doubtful thoughts "smoother in his
stomacke." Pandosto decides to poison
Eglstus; his cupbearer demurs; Pandosto
persists: the cupbearer warns Eglstus.
who sails away. Pandosto regards this
action as proof of his suspicions and he
orders hi3 wife imprisoned. When the
child Is born Pandosto sees the last proof
of his suspicion. The child is cast to sea
in a small boat. Bellaria Is brought be
fore the court, where she demands law
and Justice, but. persuaded that she will
get neither, she asks that the "oracle of
Apollo ln the isle of Dolphos be consulted
as to her guilt. Bellaria agrees to abide
by the oracle's verdict. The answer
comes: ."Suspicion is no proof; jealousy
Is an unequal 'Judge: Bellaria Is innocent;
Eglstus blameless; Pandosto treacherous;
his babe Innocent, and the king shall live
without an heir if that which is lost bÂ«
not found." The king Is ashamed at hear
ing the truth, and the prospect is good
for pleasant times, when word is brought
that his eon is dead. The news overcomes
Bellaria, who swoons and dies. Pandosto
tries to kill himself, but guards protect
him.
The little castaway Is meanwhile res
cued by a shepherd. After awhile It calls
the shepherd trnd his wife 'dad" and
"mam"; it is called Fawnia. who straight
way develops Into a beautiful girl. Dor
astus, Eglstus' son, is attracted, the two
fall in love and after he has saved up
enough Dorastus fits out a ship and sails
off with the beautiful Fawnia. They come
to Bohemia. Pandosto is overcome by his
unknown daughter's beauty. The truth
comes out; there is great merrymakintr.
and they all sail for Sicily, where the
marriage Is properly celebrated. Pandosto
in great remorse takes his own life. Do
rastus and Fawnia return with his body
to Bohemia, where they spend their days
in "contented quiet."
The story of "The Winter's Tale" was
not new, although so far as the names of
the characters are concerned the actors
in the older story do net appear. Robert
Greene In 1588 published a novel Called
"Pandosto, the Triumph of Time." or
"The Hiatorie of Dorastus and F*awnla>"
The story became popular and fourteen
editions of it a.re known to have been
published. In the beginning of the story
we are told that "among .the passions
wherewith humane mlndes are perplexed
there is none that so galleth with restless
despight as the infectious soare of jeal
ousie. '* â¢ â¢ Yes, it is such a heavy
enemy to that holy 'estate of matrimony,
sowing betweene the married couples such
deadly seedes of secret hatred, as love
being once rased out by splghtful distrust,
there oft ensueth bloudy revenge as thia
ensuing hystorie manifestly proveth.
wherein Pandosto (furiously Incensed !>y
causeless jealousle) procureth the death
of his most loving anu loyale wife, and
his owne endless sorrow and misery."
The first change Shakespeare made In
this story when lie chose it for the matter
In both subject matter and treatment
"The Winter's Tale" suggests the last
period of Shakespeare's activity. We axe
led by the title to expect something more
or less romantic; when a tale is told it U
generally a fiction of some sort. Involving
tragedy, but as often turning out happily.
"The Winter's Tale" is nd exception,
tragedy and comedy dividing the play be
tween them.
Â¦ "I have too much believed mine own
suspicion," and upon this Is brought tho
news that Hermiono is dead. Leomea
thinks It natural enough, believes his pun
ishment just and will offer up his days
at Hermione's temple. Here, In scene 2
of the third act. the tragic element stop*
The mere adaotaticn of the rest of
Greene's story would have been tanid
enough. Fortunately Shakespeare creates
the delightfully irresponsible Autolycua
for one thing. He stner". steals, lies, out
wits; morally his deserts should be dis
grace and. puriishme::t; practicallyâ a_*
sometimes happensâ he gets what he
wants, and the reputation of being a fins
and Interesting fellow to boot. His bal
lads are country ballads*, the scenes

shepherds In the long fourth act are thosa
of England, nay, perhaps those of a not
Impossible "Warwickshire.
"Come." rays Perdita. "methlnks I play
As I have seen them do In Whltsun pastorals."
There Is Indeed enough of the country
air in the last two acts to warrant the
popular Idea that in this play Shakespeare
produces much of what he saw about him
at Stratford â sheepshearing, country fair*,
ballad hawkers, festivals and the like.
The country matter, with. the songs; the
long fourth act. twice as long as any other
in the play; the highly romantic revtv.il
of Hermlone; the device of the chorus
Time, and a general mixture of far-off
things with the well-known tale, produce
the effect of romance, raUÂ»er than of real.
Inevitable human nature and human des
tiny. The great Shakespeare, once ap
palling through his expression of passion
and fate of men, now beats tlmÂ« to a pop
ular tune with his pen; in the waning
light of his Imagination he absently
watches the' country girls across the vil
lage green or hears on the uneven flags
outside tired feet dragging to a plodding
tale told In London ten years before. Waj

But the sight of the child has the con
trary effect upon the King. He Is almost
undone. "I am," he says, "a feather for
each wind that blows.' The messengers
return from Delphos, ihe suspense bein-;
increased by the short scene at the begtn
nlng of the third act. In the trial scer.j
Shakespeare adds the indictment, the rar*
legal character of which act9 as a foil to
the noble and impassioned speech of Her

agrees to abide by the oracle's decision;
she, the daughter of a Russian Emperor
(this is Shakespeare'd addition), must
come to trial. The oracle la read (practi
cally as In Greene's version) and (also a*
in Greene's story) the news is brought In
that the young Prince is dead. Hermlone
faints "(she does not die. as In Greehe'3
story): Leontes has a charge of heart.

"We are indeed further prepared for tr-..Â»

comments of the women in the scene w'.r:i

tale.
Merry or sad shall It be?
Htrmlone â As merry as you will.

Hermioneâ Let's have that, good sir.

Mamillius â Dwelt by a churchyard: I win

Hermloneâ Come on, then,, and give 't me ia
mine ear.
Here the preoccupied mother will listen
affectionately and tolerantly to the "Win
ter's Tale." But the tale is never finished.
Fast upon the scene of domestic Innocence
falls Leoates with his brutal accusation.
Hermlone is imprisoned, but to make Â«ur>Â»
of her guilt Leontea dispatches messen
gers to Apollo's oracle at Delphos. Yet it
becomes necessary to announce to the
King the birth of a child. It is hoped (as
in Greene's novel) that the sight of the
child may soften the Kir.gr.

suspicions â the very absence of such rea
sons makes his determined dlstrusrt morÂ»
settled. The jealousy in Othello is often
compared or contrasted with that of
I-eontes. The later character is what w<i
should expect, aside from the example In
Greene's novel. I.eontes feeds his fancy,
wherein the idealism of advancing age
makes it less easy to accept the testi
mony of outward circumstances and tha
Icplc of material facts.
The highly romantic and fanciful char
acter of the playâ like that of "Cymbe
llne" and "The Tempest"'â is best brought
out by a study c*f Jlermione. Natural
conditions are violated where Hermiona
Is brought to life in the last act when no
dramatic hintâ aside from that of increan
"is happiness for every oneâ has prepare 1
us for it. The notion that HerraionÂ« i3
safely secluded for a I-,ns period of years
is essentially a romantic notion. .Thn
business of the pedestal and the lor.g In-'
troductior.3 relative to the statue are ob
vious means to heighten the effect. Tn â¢Â»
question naturally arises: What woull
have been the effect had Hermlone n-jt
come to life? Scarcely different from that
of Greene's story; tho interest would have*
been centered in Perdita and the high'y
romantlc element let down to natural con
ditions.
The character of Hermlone Is the finest
In the play. In Greene's story when Be!
laria is brought be/ore the court she de
mands law and justlc. Hennione is too
deeply grieved and. too finely superior to
the vulgar wrong implied by the court,
she asks for no law, no Justice. Leonte*

and threadbare excuse of economy.
"The Supervisors have, cut down our ap
propriation by $81,000," said Denman. "and
that is why we must get along with less
teachers. . I would like to ask the Super
intendent if. In the face of the reduced
finances, he would appoint additional
teachers if he had the power?"
"I mustiadmit," said Webster, "that the
Supervisors should be condemned rather
than commended for the reduced appro
priation. But the Board. of Education is
confronted with the fact that.it has es
tablished expensive manual training and i
cooking departments. Now section 16C6 of I
the Political Code provides that special !
studies may bo pursued in the schools,
but not to the exclusion of the regular
studies specified by another section. Now
I will ask Mr. Denman, should you have
special departments to the -neglect of the
regular studies?"
Both Denman and Mark here rose to a
vigorous defense of the manual training
course and the good work being accom
plished in'that direction in Eastern cities.
"That may be all very well." said Web
ster, "but your economy could be made
more practical by not maintaining special
studies. You. will remember that several
months ago I recommended the appoint
ment of twenty-eight teachers, thirteen
of which the board has since appointed.
My recommendation was a modest one;
it would not have hampered the board's
finances and would have relieved the con
gested condition in the schools."
The report of the Superintendent fol
lows:
Deputy Superintendent W, B. Howard re
ports Inspection In the Laguna Honda School,
and declares that there are too many pupils
and grades assigned to each teacher to permit of :
first-class work with the present course of I
study. This school should be. given maps and
a liberal supply of books.
In the Richmond School the principal con
forms to the rule of the board requiring her
to teach by helping the overworked teachers In
her school.
The Jefferson- School. I>r. Howard declares.
Is typical of overcrowded schools and demands
the lmmedjate attention of school authorities.
It 1b well to note here the environment in
which this school is placed. -If any favors |
could be Â»hown schools of this city thoee of
this character should be the first to receiÂ»e
them. Classes In schools of this kind should
not exceed SO or 33 pupils, so that teachers
could elve individual pupils more attention.
There arÂ» five well-appointed vacant rooms In
this bulldtne and additional classes could be
accommodated. Â»
At the Horace Mann Grammar School good
work impeded by a too crowded attendance
of classes. This is a very large grammar
school and nhould be given the services of two
vice riflncliialB. .
The reDort on attendance In the Jefferson-
School shows as Tollows: Fourth jcrade. seats
M, p'JDlls present 59. enrolled 60; third and
fourth grades, seats 64, present 66, enrolled S9:

enrolled 68; first grade, seats 48. present 47,
enrolled 6J: first grade, seats 47, present 46,

In the Lafayette School Deputy Jordan re
ports that 33 pupils are enrolled for. whom
there are no seats. If a new class should be
Inaugurated It could "bo filled by pupils not
now enrolled. The receiving classes In the
Garfleld School are in a crowded condition and
In poor rooms. Good flags are needed In the
Irving School. The saluting of a 5-cent flag Is
not calculated to give exalted Ideas of govern
ments, national or local. In the Cooper School
two rooms with fourth grades were found with
63 children In each.
The commercial 'department In the Lincoln
Grammar School, under the direction of Colonel
C H. Murphy, was visited. Three hundred
and elchty-two students were present. Thirty
students have been supplied with positions
during this term. Forty other applications for
students to take positions could not
be supplied. The students of this school
seem to be . in demand because of
the general education they possess Â» aside
from their knowledge of technical branches.
This department should be segregated and es
tablished as a distinct. school. It cannot legally
be regarded as a part of . a grammar school
both on account of Its course of study and the
fact that all students who attend it have al
ready graduated from a grammar school.
The board has discovered a new way of
getting rid of teachers by assigning them
to the Chinese Primary' School. Rather
than teach a class In the school Miss M.
H. Slavan sent in her resignation from
the department with a request to. be
placed on the retired list. For a similar
reason Miss Kate Turney was on her re
quest placed at the bottom of the-substl
tute list at the last meeting.
Under a suspension of the rules, princi
pals and teachers were authorized to re
ceive further contributions from pupils
for the relief of the schools In Galveston.
AVebster read a letter from Superintend
ent Hopkins of the ruined city, in which
he states that $16,000 has already been re
ceived, but 148,000 in all is needed to repair
schoolhouses still standing. Another let
ter from the Brazoria County School
Committee states that 6000 children are
without school facilities and three-quar
ters of all school buildings were de
stroyed.
Denman opposed the collection of con
tributions in the schools on general prin
ciples, but Casserly took issue with him.
claiming that it was an extraordinary and
worthy case. '
The teachers of the drawing department
vof the Humboldt Evening Hlph School
and the Lincoln Evening School were
rated as evening high school teachers,
with a salary of $W per month, to date
from September 1, 1900. This is aji increase
of $10 per month.

ADVEBTISEMENTS.Both oall money and discounts In London are
above the bank rate. Our own money market

NEW YORK, Nov. IS.â To-day's stock mar
feet was the dullest eince the Monday preced
ing the election. There wore no dealings on
any considerable scale and the movement of
pricÂ«-Â« was sluggish and Irregular and not im
portant. The market narrowed very considera
bly, the nu'ir.bpr of different ctocks dealt in
being t-rr.n:i'-r :!.Â»!) for many days past. It is
not improbable that to-morrow's holiday pro
moted ihe curtailment of speculative ventures.
The. dealings were left very largely In the
hands of room 'traders and the larger interests
and the public were apparently out of the mar
krt entirely. There was no rreat pressure of
liquidation, but when any considerable volume
of Ftocks was offered there Â«aÂ» not sufficient
demand to sustain . the price. On the other
hand even small demand was sufficient to ef
fect a considerable advance in price, as the
celling order* tn the market were also on a
vÂ«-r>' small iÂ«caU-. The market was very gener
ally heavy in the earlier part of the day, large
ly from the influence of the weakness in the
London market. The disclosure through yester
diiy's London nettlement of a long: account In
Americans Is Interpreted as weakening the
u-chnical position of this market and the grow
ing tlghtpes* of money In London gives rise
to the apprfhension that New York may have
to absorb' considerable speculative liquidation
from that center. In fa-et. the selling for Lon
don account to-day was estimated as high as
75,000 ehares on balance. .

a spur lost by Charles XII at Poltawa.

CHICAGO, Nov. 28.â The abandonment of the
November corn deal was pre-eminently the
feature on the board. Phillips, who has con
trolled the market, settled with shorts yester
day, giving them 670,000 bushels at an
average price of 49%c. To-day he closed out
25.000 bushels, all that was left of his line.
In order to let some small holders out easy
he held the price up during the forenoon. This
being accomplished, he withdrew his support
and the market, which opened at 49l4^50o and
clung between those figures, dropped sharply
to 41c, at which it closed 9 cents under yester
day. December was governed by local condi
tions and December, lacking bull support, ruled
easy, selling between 36%' >4c and 35%c and
closed >,Â«c down to 35%c. Shorts settled as a
last resort, the move to bring back corn from
the East having failed.
December wheat touched the low price for
this crop, the only feature the market had to
offer. The market opened a shade up at ~0M@
70%c and touched 70*Â£c because of unexpected
steadiness at Liverpool In the face of the weak
ness here yesterday. The evidence was not
supported and a decline to 69 T^o. low price for
this crop, ensued. It had been expected that
stop loss orders would come out at 70c, but
in this bears were disappointed and on their
covering a rail" to 70'.ic followed. When this
demand ceased the market started downward
again and at the close was easy at 70%c. Trade
throughout was dull and of a holiday charaoter.
In oats the exchange of December for May at
2V4c premium for the latter formed the bulk
of trade. December closed %c down at 21%c.
Provisions were dull. The market opened
lower on heavy hog receipts and the liberal
stocks fluctuated narrowly and closed fairly
steady. January pork closed 12%c under yes
terday: lard, &Â©7%c lower, and ribs 7%@10o
down.
There will be no session of the Board of

factor in this movement. The gains were not

The wool market has been rather more active
the past week. There has been considerable
quiet locking around for all classes of wool
and the demand haa been strictly for consump
tion. Reasonable prices have been offered and
have been accepted. A larger business would
probably have been transacted had It not been
for the extremely unfavorable weather, which
hai militated against an active demand for
goods. Advices from the West continue to in
dicate a x-cry. bullish feeling. Owners of wool
continue to hold It nt hlfrh Prices are
naturally In favor of the buyer, although there
te no pressure to Bell wool, and -quotations are
unchanged.
The sales this week in Boston amounted to
4.175.800 pounds domestic and 550.000 poundB for
eign, making a total of 4.725.800. against a

sion.
The forward trucks on the electric car,
several of the stanchions and the front
and rear steps were either broken or
badly twisted. The car was lifted bodily
from the track and seemed to be left
"sitting on its haunches." the forward
end reared into the air. Traffic was de
layed for some time.
Two passengersâ menâwere on the rear
Beat of the car. They were uninjured and
catching a Kentucky-street car contin
ued on their Journey. Motorman William
Tanner and Conductor Hallen ascribe the
accident to wet rails. The brakes re
fused to work on the grade and the colli
sion was the result. Their statement Is
corroborated by several witnesses.

between the two men became very bitter.
On April 11 of last year Emerson met Mrs.
Rodgers at the well and heaped abuse
upon her.- His insulting remarks were
overheard by the husband,' who advanced
on Emerson with the intention of making
him; retract his charges. ., Emerson delib
erately pulled a ' pistol and shot Rodgers
in the thigh, and as the unarmed man waa
trying to escape the murderer fired a sec
ond time, the bullet Â£ piercing Rodgers'
brnln.
Emerson was convicted on the evidence
of - ;Mrs. - Rodcrers;: corroborated by - her
daughters. The affirming opinion was
written by, Chief Justice .Beatty and con
curred In > by the entire court. < -â¢Â¦..

F. J. Drake Arrested on a Charge of
Obtaining Money by False
Pretenses.
F. J. Drake, who recently returned from
DawBon City and who has been at the
Golden West Hotel for the last two
months, was arrested yesterday by De
tective Byram and Policeman Walsh on a
warrant charging him with forgery. The
charge was subsequently changed to ob
taining money by false pretenses.
Drake had been spendinff money freely
In the tenderloin, and to satisfy a claim
of Fred Plaxemann, one of the pro
prietors of. the hotel, from whom he had
borrowed money, he wrote a check, for
$150 on the Bank of California, although
he had no account there.
G. W. Price, manager of the Krog-h
Manufacturing Company, gives the fol
lowing story of Dr?Jte')Â« dealings with his
house and other firms ?n this city.
"Drake was a Falenman for us from
October. 1S99. to April. 1&00. During that
time he shipped to himself to Dawson City
$1200 worth of Band pumps and amalga
mators, collecting proceeds on the ship
ments to the amount of $1200. His meth
ods were bo clever that up to the day of
his departure he managed to hold hiin.M.lf
off from trouble by promising to recoup
the firm. The matter of his prosecution
Is now In the hands of our attorney. We
have succeeded in tracing some of the
machinery that Drake shipped away.
"By various representations he man
aged to get $350 wotth or goods from Hen
phaw, Bulkely & Co. He worked Reed &
Cleve. pattern makers, for $300 In caeh
and material. The Dunham, CarrlBan|&
Hayden Company are losers by $82 from
making: Drake's acquaintance and I have
learned of a large number of firms about
town who lost through listening to
Drake's oily stories.
"The hotel men who suffered : have lit
tle reason to complain. Our house noti
fied them of Drake's actions in order to
give them full warning of his methoda."

-EMDEN, 111., Nov. 28.-Four masked
men wrecked the Farmers' Bank of Em
den early to-day. It is stated that they
secured all the funds of the bank, about
$3000 or $4000. When the robbers dis
charged their first blasts of dynamite In
an effort to open the vault, the explosion
aroused John Alberts, four blocks away.
Alberts hurried to the bank. â¢
One of the robbers was on guard In the
6treet. He /seised Alberts, who was bound
hand and foot and dragged into the bank,
where he witnessed the gang drilling- Into
the vault door, making ready for a second
blast. When the fuse was lighted the
robbers stepped outside and Alberts lay
in the corner When it went off." He was
not seriously Injured, however. -
. The second blast . unhinged the vault
doorB and the robbers made off with all
the cash. Securing a handcar they pulled
In the direction -of Delavan. There they
were met by Night Patrolman Sanf ord,
who attempted to arrest them. One of
the robbers fired and ; Sanford fell, mor
tally wounded through the body. Outside
the town the men boarded : a passenger
train on the Chicago and Alton. All
traces of them were lost. The engineer
of the passenger train claims that he saw
a man Jump from the first car at Mlnler
while the train was moving at a high
speed, but a search, of the locality failed
to show any traces of the man. â¢
The bank buildinar was almost a com
plete wreck and the vault was entirely
ruined. â¢" * ; '' : -Â¦

tery.
. Charles Bruner, a laborer, secured a
warrant from Judge Fritz yesterday for
the arrest of Louis Rols, proprietor o^the
Reno lodging-house on Sacramento street,
on the charge of battery. He had Just
left the Receiving Hospital and told a
curious story.
He said that on the night of November
18 he paid 15 cents for a room In the lodg
ing-house, and after he had been asleep
for a short time Rols entered his room
and told him he must not snore so loud,
as he was disturbing the other roomers.
He promised to be good, and turned on
his side to continue his disturbed slum
bers.
About 2 o'clock in the morning Rols
burst Into. his room and dragged him out
of bed, accusing him of snoring awfully.
Rols threw him around and kicked him
so hard I that he had to be taken to the
Receiving Hospital, where it was found
that two of his ribs were broken and he
had a number of contusions and abra
sions. He had to remain in the hospital
till yesterday morning, and he at once
swore " to . the warrant for â¢ Rols' arrest.
Rols was arrested, but denied the charge.

OF IMPORTANCE
IS ANNOUNCED
After Week in Prison Wil
liam Ketteler Dies at
Hospital.
How William J. R. Ketteler. a barkeep
er, who died in the City and County Hos
pitai on Tuesday afternoon, received the
injury that caused his death is a puzzle
to Coroner and police. He was taken to
the hospital a few days before Â¦ suffering
apparently from a lacerated wound of the
scalp. He was brought there from Branch
County Jail No. 2, and as his Injury was
apparently of a trivial character and be
ing a prisoner he received but a small
measure of attention.
On his death his body was removed to
the Morgue and the autopsy showed that
a fracture of the skull was the cause of
death. How, when and where this frac
ture was received the authorities have not
been able to learn.
Ketteler was a man about 50 years of
age and was lately employed at the Belle
vue saloon. 118 Fourth street, corner of
Minna, on which latter street a few doors
from his place of employment he resided.
Occasionally Ketteler went on sprees.
On November 10, under the name of
William Cutler and giving hi.s address as
303 Minna street, he was brought to the
Receiving Hospital by friends and was
treated by L>r. Dorr tor alcoholism. He
was in a condition bordering on delirium
tremens, and was placed In a ward in the
insane department until he sobered up,
belr.g discharged on November 12.
On the morning of November 18 Police
man Pearl broueht Ketteler in from ilie
Hall of Justice, about 4:30 o'clock. A lac
erated wound of the scalp was treated by
Dr. Starr, who ordered Ketteler held for
observation. On the same morning he
was discharged, In a sober condition, ac
cording to the records of the hospital. At
the second visit to the hospital Ketteler
gave his address as 313 Minna street.
The next appearance of Ketteler was be
fore Judge Fritz, on November 20, when
ha was charged with being a common
drunk and was committed to the County
Jail for ninety days. From the time he
was discharged from the Receiving Hos
pital up to the time he was taken from
the branch Jail on Monday to the City and
County Hospital he apparently was not
suffering from any serious injury to his
skull. How he was Injured the police are
now endeavoring to find out. Coroner
Cole will also make a searching Inquiry
into the case and endeavor to recover cer
tain papers which Ketttler is said to have
left in the custody of the grocers at the
northeast corner of Fifth and Mission
streets.
Friends of the deceased allege that Ket
teler left two daughters in the East, but of
their exact location thf>y were not aware.
His papers, whether of value or not, are
zealously guarded by the grocery store
proprietors at Fifth and Mission streets,
and while admitting they were acquainted
with the deceased they are not inclined to
give out any information concerning him.

"Doc" Street's useful 3-year-old Doublet

STRANGELY enough, the same
quartet of starters that tried con
clusions on Monday, when Woos
ter Boy defeated The Lady and
Marty Bergen earned indefinite
suspension for his ride on the last men
tioned mare, met again In the Newmar
ket stakes at Tanforan Park yesterday.
This time The Lady turned the tables on
Sam Hlldreth's horse, but of course the
changed conditions may have brought
this about. There was a five pounds dif
ference of weight In favor of The Lady,
the distance was further, being one mile
and a furlong, and besides Gold Or. the
sprinter, went out In the lead yesterday
instead of being rated as he was In Mon
day's race. The talent seemed firmly con

trick, backing him hard at the short price
of 1 to 2. while 7 to 2 could bo had against
Louis Ezell's mare. Everything seemed

along In front for five furlongs, and It
took some urging on Cobum's part to de

The Lady went at him In the Btretch he
looked silly .and she beat the big fellow

Matters of Interest to Mariners and
NEWS OF THE OCEAN.
The steamer Olga is on the drydock,
,an3 an examination shows what a narrow
escape she had. Half a dozen of her
plates are "corrugated" and crumpled up
like pieces of galvanized iron, the stern
post is twisted and several other minor
repairs will bring the probable cost of the
overhauling up to $70,000.
The Occidental and Oriental Company's
Doric sailed for the Orient yesterday. She
carried twenty-six cabin passengers and
825 Chinese and Jaranese in the steerage.
She took away an unusually heavy cargo.
The bark Invercoe arrived from New
castle, Australia, late last night. She was
outside all day, but the captain would
not accept a tow until the last minute
Then he gave his hawser and got in in
time to give his crew a good night's rest.
Water Front Notes.
Willie Fraser, a boy about, 12 years of
age, lies dangerously injured at the Cen
tral Receiving Hospital. The lad is an
employe of the White House, and yester
day was out delivering parcels. On his
way beck to the store ne got on a Post
street car and when- at his corner jumped
off in front of a passing team. He was
knocked down and run over. Officer Cro
nln sent for the ambulance and had him
removed to the Harbor Hospital. There
Dr. Dray found him suffering from con
cussion of the brain and a possible frac
ture of the skull.
Nearly Lost His Life.
Commissioner Morse Finds That the
Steamer Corona Was Worth
Nine Thousand Dollars.
United States Commissioner George E.
Morse presented to United States District
Judge de Haven yesterday, his report ap
praising the value of the Bteamship Co
rona, and his report was conhrmed. The
Bteamer was wrecked on Lewis Island,
Alaska, some time ago, and her owners,
the Pacific Coast Steamship Company,
raised her and brought her to Port Town-
Bend, where she was repaired. She wai
then brought to San Francisco, where the
final repairs were made, making the total
cost $150,000, and her owners valued her at
$120,001* They claimed that as she lay on
the rocks at Lewis Island she was of no
value at all, ; or at the most of only $500
value.
Commissioner Morse decided that if she
had been left on the rocks she would have
been of no value, but as the owners elect
ed to take her off she had a determinable
value, which he found to be $9500. He
found from tho testimony that she was
worth $33,000 when she arrived at Port
Townsend from Lewis Island, and that it
had cost $23,500 to raise her and take her
thither. He reported therefore that her
value at Lewis 'Island was the difference
between the two sums. He found the
value of the freight and passage money
then pending to be $11,637 47.
VALUE OF A WRECKED i
BOAT LEGALLY FIXED
ts-jy^HE new steel bark Kalulanl did
I not get to sea last night. Captain
I Dabel thought he would be out-
JJL Bide the Farallones before sunset,
but Instead he was at anchor off
Folsom street. On her maiden run to San
Francisco the compasses of the Kaiulani
got out of order and they had to be ad-
Justed yesterday before she could go to
sea. The tugr Alert took her out and
towed her around the bay until everything
was in a satisfactory condition. Then it
was too late to sail, so the bark will not
leave port until this morning.
Captain Dabel of the Kaiulani is one of
the best known masters in the coast
trade. He was formerly in the Aloha, but
left her to take charge of the new steel
bark. The Kaiulani will take away eleven
passengers and a full cargo. She was
built by Arthur Sowall & Co. of Bath,
Me., and a full description of her has al
ready been published in The Call.

SLOT MACUINES.Taxpayers may--.like to study Into the
subject at once, and The Call furnishes
figures taken 'from the municipal reports
to assist in such consideration. The first
striking fact Â¦ observable, outside of the
increase in the price paid for the hydrants,
is that while- every Board of Supervisors
in late years has announced a reduction
in water rates the income' of the Spring
Valley Water Company has steadily
grown. Nine years ago the payments of
the city and county government for water
for public uses amounted to $SS,3D5 06. For
the fiscal year of '1898-99 the amount was
$243.165 50. The increase therefore was
$156,660 44. In the same period the reduc
tions to the private ratepayers was only
the 'difference bet-weep-- $1,516,232 54 and
$1,490,92155. or $25.310 99, leaving the com
pany a winner to the amount of $125,000
per annum on the basis of the last year
named in round figures by the increase in
the price paid by the citv and county, and
making full allowance for the reductions
to ratepayers. The growth of the charges
against the municipality Is Indicated by
the following table, which has been care-'
fully prepared from official records:
Figuratively speaking 1 , a bombshell may
be thrown among San Francisco's Super
visors as they sit to consider water rates
for the next fiscal year. In ten years the
rate for water for fire hydrants has been
doubled by successive Boards of Super
visors. The annual payments for hydrants
have grown from $47,567 50 to $206,330. The
city and county pays $60 per annum for
water for each hydrant, no matter where
it is located or whether, it is ever used.
The total increase has been 241 per cent
of the amount paid in l&9O-9i. - There is
only one explanation supplied by those
who have looked into the subject, and
that Is that hydrant rates have been put
up to permit rates to householders to be
reduced. As a matter of fact the hydrant
proposition is an annual "Joker." The
present Board of Supervisors Is likely to
be asked to explain. One Supervisor,
Charles Wesley Reed, already says that
he favors making a flat or stated allow
ance for hydrants annually.
"I do not care to be Interviewed about
rates," said Mr. Reed, "for I am sitting
now as a Judge, but I do not mind saying
that in my opinion the number of
hydrants has no relation whatever to the
amount of water supplied to the city for
fire purposes. If the hydrant water is
paid for by the city there should be a
lump sum so that there shall be no reduc
tion in the number of hydrants, for such
reduction means less protection against
fire. The scheme of direct taxation for
the purpose of lowering the, price paid by
the individual consumer Is a deception. It
is a three-thimble, trick. Those who usÂ©
the water ought to pay for it." Mr. Reed
also said, that 1 he proposed to call atten
tion to the charges for hydrants later on.

In the case of Annie J. Pronk vs. the
estate of Jesse Sheldon Potter in Judge
Dalngerfijld's court a verdict of $1200 for
plaintiff was returned by the Jury yester
day. The suit was brought to recover
$3468 alleged to be due for services as a
nurse from April to September, 1899.
When the case was called yesterday
morning the defense recalled Charles H.
Palmer for further examination. Palmer
simply reiterated his' statement that in
his opinion Potter was not ill enough to
lequire the services of a nurse during the
period Mrs. Pronk alleges such was the
case. Charles W. Glldden and James W.
Peck were called and expressed the same
opinion. Mrs. Pronk was recalled on her
own behalf and reiterated her assertion
that she 'was Potter's constant attendant.
Attorney Thomas A. Keogh opened the
argument on behalf of the plaintiff, Wal
ter Cope followed for the defense and J. C.
Campbell closed for the plaintiff. During
the argument counsel at times broadened
in their insinuations reflecting on the op
position until they almost assumed the
nature of open charges of extortion, per
jury and unprofessional conduct. An open
rupture was avoided, however, the case
went to the jury and a verdict was ren
dered as related.

Samuel G. Murphy, president of the
First National Bank, will not recover $73,
908 10 which was assigned to him by James
McDonald of the Pacific Bank. The Judg
ment given against Murphy In the lower
court was affirmed by the Supreme Court
yesterday. The Pacific Bank failed on
June 23, 1S93. Previous to the crash Mc-
Donald loaned the bank out of his private
fortune the sum In litigation, assigning
the claim to Murphy. Mr. Murphy sued
to recover the amount, but the lower
court held that it was not a loan, but
a deposit, and that McDonald, being a
stockholder, was not entitled to any of
the dividends being paid In course of liqui
dation; that he was not entitled to receive
a penny until ali the depositors were paid
up. The Supreme Court found no reason
to reverse the decision of the lower court
and therefore affirmed the decision.

FINAL DECISION IN
PACIFIC BANK CASE
President Murphy Will Not Recover
â¢ â¢ â¢
The closer you look at it. the more, 1
am sure, will you be convinced that
"Siegfried" is not an opera at all. but a
badly constructed drama; legitimate
material for dramatic criticism. The most
telling and beautiful devices of operatic
composersâ quartets, sextets, choruses
are studiously avoided; musical declama
tion by single characters is closely ad
hered to until the last few bars of the
last act. "Whether such declamation is a
higher or a lower form of art than that
Thirdâ As to dullness. The essentials
of a good drama are an interesting story,
variety passion, imagination, beauty. Jn
"Siegfried." Wagner has drawn his story
from the storehouse of a. mythology that
may amuse or frighten children, but can
hardly interest men and women. His
treatment is on a level with the poverty
of his theme: Siegfried alone carries
nearly all the first two acts with very
little of that clash and conflict with oth
ers which Is essential to the drama. .Not
until the last act does there come any
thing that rouses aught but a languid In
terest in the story. Then, be it noticed,
by bad economy of means Wagner has so
exhausted his tenor, that it is impossible
for him to do himself justice.
MITH the hard and .fast
conventions of Italian
opera dramatic criticism
has. nothing to do. These
conventions are above
or beneath criticism,
whichever 'you please;
in either case they lie outside the province
of those who ask from the drama a not
incredible representation of human life.
With Wagnerian opera it Is different.
The founder of that school proclaimed his
compositions to be "music dramas." and
as dramas they are largely lauded by
those who believe Wagner to be a great
I poet as well as a great musician. "Sieg
fried." I suppose, is fairly representative
! of Wagner, the dramaturgist; 1 saw it
excellently performed last night at the
Grand Opera-house and followed it with
an earnest desire to. conform myself unto
the pattern of the Perfect Wagnerite. To
my s=hame and sorrow, I must confess I
completely failed. "Siegfried" as a drama
is, in my opinion, puerile, tedious and dull.
First as to the puerility. What shall we
say of a serious drama that introduces
dancing bears and pasteboard dragons?
Are we back in the days of the bear-bait
ing Elizabethans, or is this really a mas-
I ter stroke of the great Wagner's that
I must shake our souls with pity and ter
ror? (1 quote from the orllcial libretto):
"Sslegfnea confronts Fafnir; the latter
creeps more over the knoll and spits from
his nostrils at him. Siegfried springs
aside. Fafnir curls his tail forward 10
reach Siegfried, but he avoids ft and
springs over the back of the dragon with
a bound. As the tail follows him and al
most reaches him be wounds it with his
sword. Fafrir hastily draws back his
tail, roars r.nd raises tne tore part of his
bodv In order to throw its full weight
sideways upon Siegfried, thus exposing
his breast to him. Siegfried quickly espies
the position of his heart ami plunges his
sword there up to th<? very hut. Fafnir
rears still higher In pain and sinks down
: upon the wound, while Siegfried leaves go
of the sword and springs aside."
Secondâ As to the tediousness. This is
bestowed upon us with a kingly lavish
ness worthy of Dogberry. Every trivial
thought is repeated over and over again
until you wonder if it .will ever succeed
in "getting itself done," as Carlyle would
say. The action Ftar.ds still and the stage
is oven left at times vacant. What musi
cal effect may be gained from this, I am
not competent to say; dramatically. I am
sure St Is absurd.

AND MORE DRAMA THAN OPERA
The young lady did not tell her parents
her plans, but yesterday a messenger con
veyed the news to the Tamm home and
the couple are waiting anxiously for a
reconciliation.
The young lady being 20 years of age,
did -not need her parents' consent, so no
difficulty was experienced when her
fiance applied for a marriage license. Os
born is well known in San Francisco and
he has appeared In print before because
of his bravery while a member of the
First California Regiment in the Philip
pines. Mr. Skinner, head bartender at
the Palace, and his wife went over to
Oakland with the couple and witnessed
the ceremony, which took" place at the
home of the Rev. Van de Mark. The
party came back to this city on the last
ferry-boat > Tuesday night and yesterday
Osborn was on duty as if nothing had
happened.
The young woman's father, who owns
considerable property in this city, nnd
who is reputed to be quite well-to-do, was
from the iirst opposed to Osborn having
anything to do with his daughter, and he
is said to have ordered him from the
'house on several occasions. It finally be
came necessary' for the couple to hold
clandestine meetings. But this sort of
thing grew wearisome to both and so it
was planned to run away and get mar
ried.
The beginning of this love affair, which
has had such a romantic ending, dates
back to the childhood days of Osborn and
his bride. They resided in the same block
on Haight street, and meeting each other
almost dally the acquaintance soon
ripened into friendship, and then Cupid
took a hand. J
Because her father objected to the
match, pretty, auburn haired Dora Tamm
eloped with William F. Osborn, the popu
lar bartender at the Occidental Hotel,
Tuesday evening, and the couple are now
living at the home of H. C. Skinner, hav
ing been married in Oakland.

AUGUST ,DRUCKEE. DIES
AFTER 'SHORT ILLNESS
Yesterday morning about 10 o'clock A.
Pardini, proprietor of the hotel, opened
his sale and was startled by the discovery
that $810 which he had deposited there
was missing. A large portion of the
money belonged to Condlto Andreucetti, a
rancher from. Sacramento. The proprietor
at once reported the case to the police
and detectives were sent out on It. About
the time that Pardini found that he had
been robbed his son, in company with the
other' two suspects, was found to be
missing.
Pardini pays that he locked the interior
compartment- of -the safe and placed the
combination, on the outer door before re
tiring last night. He left his son in charge
of the place and the boyalone knew the
combination. The. proprietor thinks that
Todino induced his son to obtain the coin
and probably used the other boy as a tool.
The detectives arrested an Italian, who
Is said to have some Information as to the
whereabouts of .the missing .money and
placed his name on, the detinue book.
A bold safe robbery was committed in
the II Capltano Hotel at 702 Front street,
Tuesday night. Nearly $1000 was taken
and the persons wanted by the detectives

BOYS SUSPECTED
OF ROBBING SAFE
A controversy has been going on for
the last two weeks In which the principals
are General Shatter and Captain D. J.
Rumbaugh, Third Artillery adjutant
at tije Presidio. A difference of opinion
concerning the right of the two companies
of convalescents at the post to the bene
fits of the canteen and poet exchange
caused the conflict.
The men of the convalescent companies
spend their money at the post and get/no
benefit from the 10 per cent profit made
on the goods sold. On the other hand, the
men of the Eighteenth Infantry and Third
Artillery receive at the end of every quar
ter the profits of the concern. The con
valescent companies petitioned Captain
Rumbaugh to be allowed to buy in, there
by placing themselves on an equal footing
with the infantry and artillery manning
the post. This petition Captain Rum
baugh, as president of the board manag
ing the affairs of the exchange, saw tit 10
reiuse, claiming that convalescents
formed no regular organization and were
not entitled to a share of the profits.
The matter was brought to the atten
tion of General Shatter, who disagreed
with Rumbaugh, claiming that at the time
the laws relating to the post exchange
were made convalescent companies were
rot thought of, consequently no provision
was made for them.. In his opinion they
were part of the regular organization and
as such had every right to increase their
company funds with a share of post ex
change profits. An order was issued by
General Shatter directing the exchange
board to sell to the convalescent com
panies a share in the post business con
cern, which gives the men a right to a
portion of the money accruing.-
Rumbaugh still contends that his judg
ment is correct and has forwarded to
Washington official documents supporting
his claim. In the meantime the men who
spend their money at the canteen and post
store will receive a portion of it back in
the way of dividends.
Chaplain W. D. McKinnon. U. S. A., re
ceived orders yesterday assigning him to
duty in the Philippines. He will go out
on the Meade.
Lieutenant Colonel James R. Campbell,
Thirtieth Infantry, has been ordered to
Manila on the Meade. He will report to
the commanding general for assignment
to duty.
One hospital steward and eighteen pri
vates frpm Fort McDowell and eighteen
privates from the general hospital at the
â¢Presidio and one private from the post
hospital have been assigned to duty in
the Philippines and will sail on the Meade.
Ralph Hannum, private. Company E,
Seventeenth Infantry, died yesterday at
the general hospital of tuberculosis.
Despite Efforts of Captain
Rumbaugh They Buy
Into Exchange.
CONVALESCENTS
AND DIVIDENDS
An animated contest for chief clerksh'p
of the Assembly is promised. The com
pensation of the office is $8 per day.
Among the- leading candidates : for the
place are H. S. Wanzer.of Santa Cruz
and Clio Lloyd of Santa Barbara.. .
Alden Anderson, who made an excellent
record as Speaker-in the regular and ex
tra sessions of the last Legislature., will,
no doubt, be' re-elected. The aspirants for
subordinate legislative positions who have
traveled throughout the State Interview
ing in their own . behalf members-elect
report that his re-election is : every where
conceded. Mr. -Anderson is at home m
Suisun attending to his business affairs.
Voluntary assurances 'of support received
bylhim from Assemblymen in- northern,
eouthern and central .counties . convince
him that he will be called to the speaker
ship. .Â¦> , -, . Â¦:
The office of sergeant-at-arms of the
Senate pays $6 a day, to say nothing of
perquisites. In the good old days the
"perqs" were worth considering. If the
sergeant-at-arms had to summon twenty
witnesses in San .Francisco to attend a
committee's inquiry in Sacramento mile
age was charged "against -the .contingent
fund for every subpoena served. -
J. Louis Martin of this. city, who was
Senate sergeant-at-arms at the last ses
sion, will doubtless be chosen'again.'Indi
cations are that he will have no opposi
tion, t . Â¦Â¦-"..Â¦ â¢ .
Frank J. Brandon of San Jose seems to
have a clear field for another term as
secretary of the Senate. The slight oppo
sition organized shortly after the election
has vanished. He will probably be chosen
without opposition, although the six Dem
ocratic Senators may caucus ; and decide
to give a candidate of their own political
faith a complimentary vote.

If I feel badly now I at once take two
or three doses, and I find it keeps me in
fine, health. Peruna is -worthy of every
one's confidence. Yours respectfully,
WM. UBELAKER.
It Is only just ordinary good, com-
mon sense to provide against inclement
weather. If you have the slightest cold,
cough, sneezing or any other indication
that you are "under the weather," a few
doses of Peruna will put you right.
Don't wait for the catarrh to fasten It-
self upon you before you begin your treat-
ment. Peruna Â¦will cure very^Id cases of.
chronic catarrh, but it takes much longer
than as If the treatment had been begun
earlier. .
Every family should be provided with
a bottle of Peruna early in November,
with which to successfully meet and over-
come the terrors of the winter that awaits
them.
One of my lodge friends advised me to
try Peruna, as it had helped him, and I
found that a bottle cured me.
Wm. Ubelaker, President of the Lake
View Lodge of Foresters, writes from

following letter:
The Peruna Medicine Co.. Columbus, O.:
Gentlemen: For years past when I have
been exposed to wet or Inclement weather
my chest would hurt me and I would have-
serious Indigestion, and I would be laiu up

and pain.
P resident Wm. Ubelaker Uses Pe-
runa as a Safeguard Against
Inclement Weather.
One of the most common forms of ca-
tarrh among delicate women la catarrh
or the pelvic organs. This leads to a host
of maladies which hrtve been called fe-
male diseases. But the. wise physicians
recognize In these cases the same old
enemy, chronic catarrh. Catarrh Is ca-
Inclement Weather Begins
The Last of November
Inclement weather begins in No-
vember. 7 he great objection to our
climate is that it alternates between
the heat of the tropics and the rigors
of the Arctic.
The system becomes relaxad by the
effects of the heat, and the first cold
snap of November sows the seed of
thousands of cases of chronic ca-
tarrh which in a large per cent of
cases will end fatally.

A Careless Bridge-Tender.
Through the carelessness of the Fourth-
etreet bridge tender in leaving the draw-
bridge in an uneven condition after he
had closed it there was a whole lot of pro-
fanity used by carmen and passengers
yesterday afternoon. The bridge was left
in such a condition that the inward-bound
trolley cars Jumped the track and stuck
on the side of the trackway, blocking up
traffic at a time when hundreds of labor-
ing men were returning from the various
manufacturing Industrie^ in the Potrero
to their homes. The act of the bridge
tender caused a general blockade of all
travel over the bridge, as cars and teams
â¢were compelled to halt until the cars were
lifted back on to the track.
