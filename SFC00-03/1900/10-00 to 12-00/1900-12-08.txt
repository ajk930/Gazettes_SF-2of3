LEGAL APPRAISEMENT OP
VANDEEBILT ESTATE
â¢ Rear Admiral Charles O'Neil, chief of
ordnance and president of the Board of
Construction, said, that at one time ft was
thought that the designs prepared by the
Board -of Construction provided for (ships
that would cost more .than Congress had
allowed, but: the result shows that the
board was fully Justified' in its action.
"The bids were low," he eald, "and I
was very agreeably surprised. It is per
fectly, gratifying to the Construction Bu
reau " to V find that the average cost of
sheathing, as shown by the bids, is about
3 pen cent instead of i per cent, as it was
estimated. All the. money appropriations
will be required to bu:id the vessels and
additional appropriations. will have to be
made to'equip the ships.'/
Rear Admiral HIchborn. chief . : con
structor, also expressed gratification at
the result of the competition.
"The bids were very satisfactory, in
deed. I was gratified to find they are
within the. appropriations. Competition
Illustrates the growth of. the navy.- It Is
interesting to compare the gathering to
day, composed of ] representatives of mil
lions of capital and great aggregations of
labor, .with. that which occurred ten years
ago'wheri bids' were opened for battleships
of the Oregon^ class. Then there were but
few firms represented "in the competition.

proposal of the Cramps, and two un
sheathed cruisers for $3,775,000 each.
It may be that the Board of Construc
tion will recommend that the Fore River
Engine Company receive one armored
cruiser, but. this possibility is considered;
very slight. The company, will probably
claim that the. contract for two armored
cruisers should . be awarded, to it on the
ground that Its proposal for the construc
tion of the three armored cruisers author
ized by the act'of June 7, 1900, is the same
as that of the Newport News Company,
$3,775,000, and 55000 less than the bid of
the Cramps for one of the vessels. So far
as sheathed, vessels are- concerned the
bid of the Fore River Engine Company is
out of the question, as for one vessel It Is
$S5,000 higher than that of the "Cramps,
$90,000 higher than that of the ; Newport
News Company and $175.000 ; higher than
that of - the Union ;Iron' Works. It offers
to construct ; one unsheathed ' armored
cruiser for $3,800,000, $20,000 more than 'the
Union Iron Works, one unsheathed bat
tleship at $3,400,000, and two . armored
cruisers at $3,800,000 for sheathed vessel
and $3,750,000 for unsheathed ship. ..

W.. WASHINGTON, Dec. 7-Probably
the greatest aggregation of ship-build-;
Ing capital ever gathered In the United
States was represented . to-day at the
opening of bids at the Navy Department
for the construction of eleven armor
clads, which, ready for. service, will cost
the Government more than $60,000,000.
There was real competition In these bids,
and as a result the construction of the
projected battleships and armored cruis
ers will not be confined to three firms-
Cramps, Newport News, and Union .-Iron
Works, which have hitherto supplied ves
sels of this type for the service. To the
gratification of Secretary Ix)ng and other
officials of the Navy Department who
participated In the opening'. of, the bids,
other firms besides the pioneers named

LONDON, Dec. 7.â Carl JohnsCon is
amused by reports cabled from New York
that he had married Miss Neustetter and
gone with his bride to Cape Nome. The
New York correspondent of one of the
London papers gave the news as an after
noon dinner announcement by the Duke
of Manchester at, the Waldorf-Astoria.
The Duke ought to have known differ
ently, for he and Mr. Johnston were both
at the Carlton Hotel only a fortnight ago.
Johnston married Â¦ some weeks ago, not
the lady mentioned in the dispatches, but
Miss Lulu Birdsall, , who is well known
to many. New York men about town. Mr.
Johnston Is no nearer Cape Nome than
London, where he is devoting his time to
the very honorable occupation of making
NEW, YORK, Dec. 7.â Carl Johnston, or
"Carle" as he Is familiarly known, first
became well known in New York a year
ago, when he accompanied the i Duke of
Manchester here as his private secretary.
It was reported that' Johnston was to wed
a wealthy American girl. He denied this,
however, and said he was going to Cape
Nome, displaying his railway and steamer
tickets to prove It. "
His Journey was interrupted by a cable
gram from Lady Boyer, wife of Sir
George Boyer,". formerly Miss Ethel Ack
lom of California, conveying the informa
tion that she had been sued for divorco
and he named' as co-respondent. John
ston, returned to England and made
strenuous denial of wrong doing, but the
divorce was granted early last month.-

the people of the province of Chill are
extremely pleased and gratified at the be
havior of the American troops towar'fl the
Chinese. This is considered no light mat
ter. From all sections of the portion of
the city under American supervision come
words of praise, thankfulness and com

Americans.
LONDON, Dec. 7.â In the House of
Commons to-day Joseph Walton, Radical
member for West Riding, Barnsley, York
shire, moved an amendment to the effect
that, more adequate measures should be
taken to safeguard >the interests of China
and that no demand should .be made on
the Chinese Government for the punish
ment of Chinese officials which could not
be Equally Imposed in the case of a Eu
ropean power. This amendment also de
clared that reparation should be sought
In trade facilities rather than money in
demnity.
Viscount Cranborne, replying, contended
that it would not be opportune to make
a; general . statement Â¦ -while-
were proceeding. The Government, he
said, adhered to the policy announced last
August. He asked' the honorable mem
bers not to embitter matters, by bringing
charges that could not be proved. He
went on to say that he had a sanguine
view regarding the railway in China, but
he was not able to say what tho powers
were arranging as to the waterways and
the adjustment of.- the- revenue. He de
clined also to Â¦' say. anything regarding
Russia's action at Niuchwang. ,.\
"The Government Is attending to British
commercial interests," he said, "buf pa
tience is needed, as the progress is neces
sarily slow. I hope to lay papers on the~
table Monday next, but there has not been
time to publish the whole papers."

inventor of sub-marine torj^do boats,
held the attention of a large audience to
the end of his lecture before the faculty

given on naval architecture before the
students. Dr. Farmer, president of tho
Alumni Society, introduced the inventor,
who received an ovation. His lecture was
graphic and profusely illustrated with
stereopticon views.
Mr. Holland began his lecture with a
brief history of sub-marine "boats and
their many failures. "I was compelled to

Kruger Turned Away Because of Se-

BERLIN, Dec. 7.â It is learned from an
unusually well informed source that it is
the Intention of the Government to issue
In one form or another an exhaustive
declaration which will justify in the eyes
of the public its policy concerning Mr.
Kruger. In this declaration there will be
a passage in- which the Government will
refer to the Anglo-German secret treaty
regarding Africa, which Inspires its pres
ent attitude.
In the Reichstag to-day, answering
Herr Roescker's interpellation regretting
that Mr. Kruger had not been received,
"but had been "turned away from the
gates of Germany out of regard for an
other country, contrary to the feeling of
the nation," Count .von Posadowski-
Wehner, Minister for the Interior, replied
that he greatly .regretted that Herr
Roescker. had npt given previous notice
of the question, as he would have asked
Count von Bulow to answer "the difficult
question in per son. He added that it was
comparatively easy for Irresponsible Dep
uties to give expression to certain popu
lar currents of opinion, but a man occu
pying the responsible post of Chancellor
of the German empire, who was answer
able not only for the peace of. Germany,
but also under certain circumstances for
the peace of the whole world, would not
allow himself to be influenced by such
popular and eentlmental waves of opinion.
For him there was but one courseâ to pre
serve the peace, safety, welfare and in
terests of the fatherland.
LONDON, Dec. 8.â Mr. Kruger has
abandoned all the proposed journeys to
other capitals, says the Brussels corre
spondent of the Standard, and all further
diplomatic efforts to secure arbitration
and will await at The Hague the devel
opment of events at the seat of war.

women sat this afternoon In the ballroom
at Sherry's and played progressive eu

the Army and Navy Society, which cares
for disabled volunteers and their families.
In addition to the players there were sev

There were less than a score of men
present, and most of them disappeared to
ward the close of the day. General Egbert
L. Vlele, president of the society, held his
ground, however, and afterward made a
speech, in which he expressed his appre

mittees. On the platform were tempting

cluded a piano, clocks, hats, plants, bric
a-brac and all varieties of fancy work.
.When the distribution of prizes was an

be in at the death, crowded upon the plat
form. General Viele found It necessary to
ask those" on the platform to step down,
as he feared it might give way beneath
their weight. The crowd, however, would
not budge. Then the bugle sounded
through the hall and Mrs. Richard Henry
Savage made an address which effectually
cleared the stage. Mrs. M. L. Botay was
then awarded the first prize, an upright
piano: the second, an oil painting, fell to
Mrs. Gourard.

' A special from Vienna, says: - The resig
nation of the Bulgarian Cabinet, presided
over by MM. Ivanschoff and Radoslavoff, '
Is regarded, in political circles here ns very
be'rious and a very important event. ; The :
Cabinet and the Sobranje are In such per
fect harmony that It seems as if there is
nothing left for the Prince but to estab-'
llsh a military dictatorship under his fa
vorito. General Patrikoff . as the Sobranje
is very unlikely to vote the budget for, any
new ministry. The Prince is farxfrom be
ing popular with his subjects, and as. M. :
Radoslavoff, the Minister of the Interior,
at the present moment the most promi
nent politician in Bulgaria, is said to have
been concerned in a bribery matter de
tected by Prince Ferdinand himself. It is
considered probable that the crisis will
cause serious difficulties for the Prince
and his regime.
It is raid that M. Radoslavoff demanded
120.000 francs commission on the contracts
for new hartor .works. This money. In
stead of being sent to the Minister, was
gent to Prince Ferdinand. Again, one of
the chief Government officials under M.
Radoslavoff received 200,000 francs as a
bribe for ordering a number of railway
locomotives in Brunswick. When the loco
motives arrived tl:ty_were found to be
completely useless.
Murderer Is Beheaded.
A special from Berlin says: August
Goenczl, the Hungarian who murdered a
wealthy widow named Schulz and her
daughter hero in 1S97.' was beheaded this
morning in the prison of Ploetsenze. The
murder was an atrocious one and was
committed lr the center of Berlin. The
murderer was ultimately traced to Brazil
through a pet dog and was arrested at
Rio Janeiro a year ago.
Capital punishment is so unusual here
that the execution attracted considerable
attention.
It was only yesterday that the Court of
Criminal Appeals confirmed the sentence
of death passed upon Goenczi. His vic
tims- were miserly persons," who were
known to have concealed large sums of
money In their house on Koenig-Graetzer
strasse. The trial of Goenczi was remark
able from the fact that he invented for
the purpose of his defense a man whom
he called' "Lowey" and persuaded a num
ber of persons that "Lowey" was in exist

to-day passed a vote of no confi

after one of the stormiest city

of fraud were hurled broadcast. The Earl
of Chesterfield, who presided, received a
cablegram from John Hays Hammond,
the American engineer, asking him to an

mond's connection with the mine, dated
from after the shortage of ores was dis
covered. His Lordship proceeded to say
that a cable message received from State
Geologi&t Klcltard of Colorado, dated Oc
tober 20. conveyed the first Intimation of
serious misrepresentation on the part of
the old management In regard to the value
of ores. This was not published because
it was vague and incomplete, but had the
directors had any, conception of the fore
shadowed discrepancy of $12,000,000. a's
shown in the subsequent report of Mr.

Mr. â¢Kickd.ru made a personal explana

WASHINGTON. Dec. 7.â The House to
day passed the; Grout oleomargarine bill
by a vote of 196 to 92. The substitute of
fered by the minority of the Committee
en Agriculture, which imposed additional
restrictions on the sale of oleomargarine
to- prevent its fraudulent sale as butter
nnd increased the penalties for violations,
was defeated by a vote of 113 to 178.
The bill as passed makes all articles
known as oleomargarine, butterine. imi
tation butter or Imitation cheese trans
ported into any State or Territory for
consumption or sale subject to the police
power of such State or Territory, but pre
vents any State or Territory from forbid
ding tho transportation or . sale of such
product when produced or sold free from
coloration in imitation of butter. The bill
increases the tax on oleomargarine col
ored in Imitation of butter from 2 to 10
cents per pound and decreases the . tax
on oleomargarine uncolored from 2 cents
to a quarter of a cent per pound.
A long and Interesting debate preceded
the vote, in the course of which those
who favored the Grout bill claimed the
additional tax on colored oleomarg irine
was the only effective remedy for pre
venting fraud upon the public, while those
who opposed it contended that fraud
would be prevented by the substitute and
that the real -purpose of the Grout bill
Â¦was to destroy the oleomargarine Indus
try.
â¢Chairman Payni* of the Ways and Means
Committee reported the war revenue re

rail up the bill after the disposition of

Representative Taylor of Ohio, who was
prominently identified with the movement
to exclude Brigham Roberts of Utah from

lor says, however, that his aim goes con
siderably beyond a mere uniformity of
such laws Â»nd is expressly designed to
reach polygamy and put an end to it. He
regards this form of remedy as the most
effective and far-reaching.

Mr. Teller contended that If the United
States desired to build the canal it should
proceed to do so without trying to secure
the consent of Great Britain. He said
that the opinion of Secretary Hay that
the abrogation of the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty was necessary as a preceding per
formance after all was only the opinion
of one man; then he quoted from public
documents in which former Secretaries
of State had differed in their opinions In
this respect. He also showed that in some
Instances there had been breaches of the
Clayton-Bulwer treaty. He quoted Secre
tary Evarts as sayine that the guaran
tee of neutrality is aWk thing, while the
question is unsettled, and quite another
when the canal shall be opened to the
interests, ambition and cupidity of the
commercial nations, and Is occupied by
populations of foreign allegiance and dis
cordant habits. Â¦ - , t
"The United States shall be at liberty
to maintain such military forcÂ« along the
canal as may be necessary to protect It
against lawlessness and disorder."
The Colorado Senator's amendment pro
vides for the striking out of the rlrst
ser.tence of this provision and for verbal
changes in the remaining portion, making
it read as follows:
"No fortifications shall be erected com
manding the canal or the waters adjacent.
The United States, however, shall be at
liberty to maintain such military police
along the canal as may be necessary to
protect it against lawlessness and dis
order."
Senator .Teller spoke, for about two
hours, giving notice of his amendment at
the beginning of his address. The amend
ment suggested relates to section 7 of
article 2 of the treaty. As that section
;iow stands it reads- as follows:
Senator Lodge did not ask to have a
dale fixed for a vote on the treaty itself;
believing that tho fate of the measure
will be determined by the result of the
vote on the amendment.
An agreement for a vote on the com
mittee amendment was secured soon af
ter, the executive session began. It was
reached by unanimous consent at a re
quest made by Senator Lodge.
An agreement on the part of the Sen
ate to vote on the amendment offered by
the Committee on Foreign Relations, pro
viding for the policing of the canal, on
next Thursday at 3 o'clock.

Taylor, charged with having assaulted
Professor D. E. Martin with a buggy
whip on a crowded street during the
Agricultural Fair, was acquitted by a
Jury this evening. The Jury wa3 out two
hours before an agreement was reached.
When It returned the verdict favorable
to Mrs. Taylor she arose and thanked the
jurors for the consideration they had
shown her.
Justice Brown's courtroom was too
small to accommodate the throng that
gathered to hear the testimony of Mrs.
Taylor. The defendant said on the wit
ness stand that she struck Professor
Martin but twice, and only after he had
harassed her to a point of intense excite
ment by "laughing In her face" and by
whirling his horse around so that she
was obliged to step out of the way In
order to avoid the animal's heels. She
said she took the whip from the socket
of her brother's buggy and drew It
through her hands, debating whether she
should strike the professor, but put It
back. Professor Martin again laughed,
and she Immediately took the whip and
struck him twice, saying as she did so:
"I have been waiting for this."
Mrs. Taylor declared that Professor
Martin had harassed her repeatedly, and
his actions toward her had so preyed
upon her mind as to bring about a state
of Intense nervousness. ,
John S. Taylor followed his wtfe on the
witness stand. He told of two occasions
when Professor Martin whistled at him
on the street.
Other witnesses, mostly relatives of
Mrs. Taylor, swore that Professor Mar
tin whirled his horse around to annoy
Mrs. Taylor.
The prosecution introduced a number
of witnesses In rebuttal. Mr. McCorkle
declared that Mrs. Taylor walked delib
erately up to Professor Martin and slash
ed him with the whip. W. T. Hurt tes
tified that he had seen Mrs. Taylor walk
behind Professor Martin on the street
and shake her fist at him.
Professor Martin was again called to
the stand, and said that he had always
acted as a gentleman toward the Tay
lors and had avoided them rather than
court trouble.
The argument to tbÂ« jury occupied
most of the afternoon.

CRESCENT CITY, Dec. 7.â Three weeks
have elapsed since the strange disap
pearance of young Walter Brooking of
Smith River in the mountains in the
northern part of Del Norte County.
Though a constant search has been main
tained, on. trace of him has been discov
ered. That he is dead can scarcely be
doubted. The only theory that could
negative this presumption Is that possi
bly, from accident or, other cause, he be
came suddenly bereft of reason and wan
dered away into some remote region. His
familiarity with the topography of the
country for many miles around precludes
all Idea of his having become lost, If in
his proper mind. The territory through
which his course was directed, or over
which. ho would have roamed In quest of
game, has been so thoroughly examined
that further Investigation in that region
is regarded as useless.
The commonly accepted theory Is that
Brooking has been murdered, and that
his body has been buried, and that to
conceal the crime his dog, also, "was dis
patched and Its carcass secreted.
Two brothers of the missing man,
Harry and George Brooking, arrived by
the latest steamer from San Francisco to
join in the search. Their investigations
will, at first, be confined to a region not
far distant from the residence of Paul
Frederick, on Winchuck River, in which
locality two gunshots were heard by per
sons living further down the river the
day after that upon which Walter Brook
ing should have reached Frederick's
house.

The Senator was rushed out Into the
front office, but in a few minutes Rea
broke away from those holding him and
was after his man. He rained blows right
and left on Shortridge. They struggled
toward the front doors, where Rea landed
a powerful blow on the Senator's mouth,
loosening several teeth and knocking him
against the front doors, shattering two
large panes of glass. Rea was about to
follow up this advantage, but the guests
of the place Interfered and separated the
decanter and attacked the Senator.
Shortridge threw his head to one side and
the heavy bottle struck him on the left
shoulder, knocking him from his chair.
According to Shortridgo. Rea then Jumped
upon him and kicked him on the leg and
the abdomen.

combatants. Shortridge then retired to
the parlor of the hostelry to dress his
wounds, arrange his tie and quaff a glass
of bromo seltzer to settle his nerves,
while Rea left the place, sought the Inner
ofllce of his real estate establishment and
retused to be Interviewed except at the
end of a telephone line.
Rea intimates that the trouble had Its
origin In his refusal to patronize Short
ridge's paper. The latter has recently
gone into oil ventures and friends of the
ex-boss assert that the latter's refusal
to buy oil stock and to loan Shortridge
$100 inspired the article criticizing Rea's
management of the Union Savings Bank.
Rea is much the larger man and had his
blow with the decanter struck Shortridge
on the head it probably would have
crushed the skull. Friends* of both men
predict further trouble.
Entering the hotel the editor found
Rea at luncheon In a box with W. J.
Leet. Mr. Hornbeck of Gilroy and A. H.
Holman. In an adjoining box was Senator
Louis Oneal, David Hogan of San Fran
cisco, Supervisor Paul P. Austin and Emil
Lamolle, and these were interested spec
tators of the trouble.
Shortridge took a seat at the end of the
table at which Rea was seated. The two
men passed the time of day in a pleasant
manner and then Shortridge inquired
about Union Bank affairs. He asked sev
eral questions concerning the doings of
the board of directors this morning. Rea
said they had sold some land near Fresno
for $1000. which sum would run the bank
for a month.
"You surely don't want it published that
It costs $1000 a month to run the bank?"
the doughty Senator asked.
The question enraged Rea. It was re
marked by some one present that $425 was
about the cost of conducting the bank for
a month, and Rea nodded assent. Rea
then angrily told the editor that he want
ed nothing published but the truth, and
that he did not like the article that had
already appeared. Shortridge made some
bantering remark, and Rea said he would
stop his publishing such stuff. The Sena
tor replied that the many newspaper men
who had roasted Rea were still alive and
that he could not be intimidated.
Shortridge was seated In a chair a few
feet away. His last remark so enraged
Rea that the politician grasped a heavy
A heavy glass decanter and two pairs of
fists were used. The row was the outcome
of an article published in the Evening
Herald on Wednesday evening criticizing
the management of the defunct Union
Savings Bank, of which Rea is president.
For the past two days rumors of an im
pending fight between the two have been
going around town, and it is said that last
night Rea was looking for Shortridge.
About noon to-day Shortridge called at
Rea's office to see the ex-boss and was
told the latter was in the Lamolle House,
a few doors away.
statesman received a swollen lip
and a sprained and bruised leg. Two
panes of glass In the front door were
shattered and a general commotion cre
ated. Rea emerged from the fight with
only the serenity of his temper jarrefl.

This Is not the first outbreSk of Wil
!iam Seaton's temper or madness, but on
only one occasion previous to Thursday
did his temper rise to a point where mur
der was threatened. While the family
was living on a farm near Decatur, 111.,
he became involved in a quarrel with his
sister and drew a razor and attempted
to kill her. but she was saved by her
uncle, the man he murdered yesterday.
By direction of Prosecuting Attorney
McElroy. Dr. John B. Loughary will to
day make a careful examination of the
mind of the murderer. The date of the
Inquest will not be set until the fate of
the two little girls is known. Daniel
Richards is the only one of Seaton's vic
tims now dead. The Hobgood children
are hovering between life and death and
may pass away at any time. Hopes are
entertained for Myrtle's recovery If In
flammation does not set in. The doctors
refuse to abandon hope for Hazel, al
though It will be a miracle If she sur
vives. The skulls of both children were
crushed and It was necessary to perform
an exceedingly delicate operation.
Annie Seaton, the fourth victim of the
tragedy. Is resting easily and will re
cover. Her real name Is Mrs. Clark, but
as she and her husband separated, she
goes by her maiden name. She was mar
ried to Clark at Indianapolis In July. 189S.
Mrs. Mary Larkins, the mother of the
murderer, has not been told the details
of Seaton's crimes. She only know? of
the attack upon her daughter, and is con
tinually with the latter in the hospital.
Daniel Richards leaves an 11-vear-old son
at Everett, where his divorced wife lives
Lewis Seaton came to Seattle in July,
1S99. At that time his brother and uncle
were in Nebraska, but thev came on to
Seattle in October, followed shortly by
Mrs. Larkins and her daughter. Richards
was a carpenter and the two Seaton boys
have been employed in a local stave fac
tory. Lewis Seaton is 24 years of age and
the eldest of Mrs. Larkins' children. The
murderer will not be 21 until January.
The sister is a year younger.

THE duck and quail shooters an
reaping harvests of feathered
slain on marsh and upland. Rare
ly has there been such a season
as this for quail, and even the
habitual recalcitrant among the duck
shooters forgets his choice expletives
fipainst the scarcity of game. Of course
there arc days, even a full week, when
the shooting on the ponds is poor. This
Is due to sudden changes in the weather,
which, when righted, brings with it
enough -winged life more than to counter
balance the misery of a non-successful
ehoot.
In San Mateo County quail are plentiful,
but they are immuned from the hunter's
gun. The season closed there on Decem
ber 1. In Marin the season will not close
until January 15. This is the mecca of
sportsmen, particularly on the big pre
serves of the Country Club and the Point
Reyes Shooting Club. The limitation of
twenty-five birds, a county law, has been
very beneficial to Marin County, and
nlmrods Â¦who find favorable localities for
their shooting experience little difficulty
in bagging the full limit of a day's Bport.
The abundance of quail throughout the
State Is one of the most noticeable fea
tures of this year's game conditions. The
California Game and Fish Protective As
sociation, realizing this, js anxious to
make assurance doubly sure and impress
upon the next Legislature the necessity
of an absolute, restrictive measure. No
killing of quail within the next two years
is what the association will advocate. This
they say will stock California with birds
and make it the delight of sportsmen for
years to come.
The chief labor, of the association will be
directed toward the - passage of a bill
drafted last May at the flsh and game
convention. This bill, if passed, will limit
a single day's shooting to twenty-five
of any one kind of game, with the excep
tion of wild geese. Â¦
While the protectionists are working for
Improved game conditions the sportsmen
are out on the fields and ponds stringing
their birds. R. A. Eddy leads the list this
week. Last Sunday he made a record of
165 birds, 101 of which were canvasbacks.
This is an eye and mouth opener.
An amusing incident of the week is the
trip of Dr. Charles H. Boll. C. F. Fuller.
Roy Fuller, Dr. Robert Millar, H. Fee
ney, J. Miller and M. O. Feudner. Last
Sunday they went way beyond Chandler,
106 miles from San Francisco, for a duck
shoot. They slept in a warehouse. They
walked ten miles in a fierce, cold north
wind, with hardly enough food to stem
the tide of stomachic craving. The entire
party killed just seventeen ducks. As
the market hunters were not to be found
that was the size of the combined string
exhibited upon the return to town.
Sunday last was a poor day generally.
At the Field and Tule Club it was
"spooney" day, nothing but spoonbills,
and not many at that. The Wednesday
shoot was much better, however, and the
members say the ducks are coming back
to the ponds. H. X* Miller was high man,
with thirty-one birds. Mallard, sprig, teal,
widgeon, spoonbill and canvasback were
in the bags. L. Titus, H. B. Hosmer, H.
8. Miller. J. B. Coleman. J. J. Wirtner and
L. Harpham will try their luck to-mor
row. ,
J. B. Coleman and Charles Fair had fair
success last Sunday on Mr. Fair's shoot
ing ponds.
Italian fishermen at Point Pinole have
been drowning, ducks by the hundred.
They catch them in flshjiets. The unsus
pecting ducks duck under the floating
bobs and are thus caught and entangled.
Whole flocks perish in this manner.
E. McMullIn and J. Sonntag were out
â¢
for quail last Sunday in Sonoma. County.
They bagged thirty-five birds.
C. H. Precht had Rood luck back of. To
caloma on the same day.
J. F. Howard tried San Pedro Canyon
last Sunday and returned with a string of
quail.
Reports show the quail to be very wild
and hard to get at They dlngr to the
treea owing to the dampness of the
ground. They are now beginning to take
to the grass. -
r>r. J. M. Barrictanan, who narrowly es
caped with his life, has a genuine bear

LEAGUE MEN
PICKED FOR
BEST TEAM
This afternoon at 2 o'clock play will
begin on the Presidio ltnka in the quali
fying round over eighteen hn!es. match
play, for a round robin tournament. Th*
twelve players making the lowest scores
will he ellsible to enter the tournament,
in which each man will play over eigh
teen holes, match play, against every
other man. Each man will thus have to
play eleven matches, all of which must
be finished before May 1, 19m. If a man
wins a match 1 or 2 up, he will count
one point; if he win.-* 3 or 1 up. he will
add two points to his score: if he wins 5
or more up, he will score three points.
The total number of points lost by a
player In his unsuccessful matches will
be deducted from hia gross score, and
the two men who make the greatest
number of points after this deduction will
win the first and second prizes. The
object of reckoning by points instead of
by holes is to prevent a man from win
ning the tournament through defeating
one or two competitors by large margins.
The purpose in deducting the number cf.
ncims lost from the number won is to
decide between two players who misht.
win the same number of points. Such.
a contest as this takes the place of a con
tinuous tournament, such as !s heinsj
plaved amone the ladiea of the San Fran
cisco Golf Club, or of a challenge clasis.
such as is found at Oakland and other
clubs. On some morning during next
week the ladies will hold a puttinjf con
test, four balls on each green, on the
Presidio links.
The preliminary arrangements for a
home-and-home match between two
teams representing the San Francisco and
Oakland Golf Clubs have been made be
tween H. B. Goodwin and P. E. Bowles.
The first match wil! probably take place
some time In January-
Durinjr the time when the military res
ervation was crowded with soldiers, tha
Presidio golfers experienced much annoy
ance from artillery drilling over the links,
cutting up the fair green wfth heavy
wheel ruts and hoof marks. Now. how
ever, orders have been given by the mili
tary commandant forbidding not only
the drilling of artillery, but even the pres
ence of horsemen on the links.
The tournament of the Sausallto Golf
Club is approaching completion. Tha
final round in the men's championshtp
event was played last Sunday afternoon
between Leonard Chenery and F. D
Findley, the former winning with a score .
of 72 to 73 for nine holes. The perpetual
challenge cup was won by F. B. Findley,
whose score of 67 in one of the earlier
rounds of the contest was the lowest
made during the tournament. Leonard
Chenery took the second cup. Mlsa Wini
fred Mason and Miss Mabel Mason are
left in rhe final round of the ladles'
championship event. In" the mixed four
somes Miss Winifred Mason and R. W.
Mason have an unfinished match to play
out against Miss Grace Martin and W. A.
Horn. The winning couple will play the
final round against M!*a Mabel Mason
and J. M. Kilcarif.
Horace Rawlins and his brother Harry
Rawlins, the professionals of the Oak
land Golf Club, did not pay their ex
pected visit to the SausaMto links last
Sunday, but will be there to-morrow
afternoon. There will be a large attend
ance of members to see the experts play
around the course.
The Southern Pacific and. Santa Fe rail
way companies will bring Willie Smltn
and David Bell, the celebrated golfers,
to California, the object b*-lnsr to nhnw
to Eastern golfers that their favorite
game may be enjoyed all through th%
winter. The companies will pay the sal

Bill and ln the fourth event, a seven fur-
Ions run, he Fhowed the way home in
front of Johnny Schorr's Sea Lion and
Fix others. One day last summer Bill
Garrett made his appearance at Chicago
trained by an old man wearing blue over
alls and sporting m. bunch of whiskers
planted before the \vur. Bill started in a
race and the old man unpacked a musty

ia better company, he was 150 to 1 and
proved "oil from the can." Then some
body bid the horee up and the old man
â¢went home. Sea Lion was looked upon as
a. certainty by the favorite players in yes
terday"s race, but J. Miller did not put
up one of his most brilliant rides and the
rank outsider beat him out a length.

vember 5, received to-day, gives details
of the smallpox epidemic now prevailing
there. There have been about Â¦ thirty
cases. Some have recovered and sixteen
were quarantined on the date named.
Cold weather seems to have made the con
tagion more prevalent than before.
The Yukon . Council has- ordered â¢ that
every person in the Yukon territory^ from
White Horse to Forty-Mile, be vaccinated
at once. This district contains about
12,000 people. The Yukon Council ordered
12,500 vaccine points, of which the first
shipment was expected by mail about
November 15. Six Dawuon physicians
were employed at $30 a day each to eo
out on the creeks and vaccinate all who
have not been vaccinated within seven
years. No deaths have yet occurred from
smallpox, due to the good care given all
patients. ;
Dr. MacArthur. the Health Officer savs
it Is likely all persons going to Yukon
territory as late as next summer will
have to be vaccinated. He believes how
ever, that with thorough vaccination the
disease as it now exists may be stamped
out in a month. The Northwest "mounted

on Thanksgiving day. President Van Lieu
and other members of the Chico faculty
are chaperoning the party.
As soon as the: noise subsided the Chico

Bannockburn Will Face
the Barrier Again.
The Recall Flag
Question.
The troubles of James Tod Sloan now
engross the attention of the turf- world.
If ever Tod is deprived of making a living
through his skill in the saddle he might
turn his hand to the show business. As
an advance agent he would sh.ne, for lie
understands thoroughly the art of keeping
his name before the public, even if cham
pagne bottles and cockney waiters axe
necessary auxiliaries. If Sloan has been
turned down ln England, and it looks very
much as if he had, the "Western coyotes"
may be asked to receive him again. ThU
was a cheerful and breezy way of refer
ring to Western turf officials and possi
bly just such pert and cute sayings as this
added to the Jockey's popularity on the
other side of the pond.
In all likelihood Bannockburn, the big
brown horse which holds the California
mile record of 1:39, made 'over both Oak
land and Tanforna Park tracks, will be
seen at the post again next year. Cross
ing on the ferry-boat the other morning
Barney Schreiber said he had the horse
fired after his breakdown in the East the
past season and that now he is going good
and sound at Woodlands Farm track. The
son of Hayden Edwards will be entered
for both the Brooklyn and Suburban han
dicaps. - â¢ â¢ - . â¢
People around a racetrack occasionally
see and hear too muchâ that is, for their
own pecuniary benefit. One d&y at Tan
foran Park not long ago Rio Chico start
ed in a hurdle event, ruling a pronounced
favorite. Willie Sink, his owner, strolled
intoÂ«the ring and was soon under the es
pionage of several players desirous of
"stringing theirs" with the stauie. Wil
lie epoke half a dozen :vords with a book
maker who happened to be on the dead
line and walked off. Shortly after this
same penciler raised the price against the
horse half a point, which was taken for
granted by the sharpshooters as a sign
that nothing was doin^ and a rush was
made to hedge out. Rio Chico went out
and won ail the way.
/Bookmaker Eddie Burke will be out
here, it is said, before cobwebs gather on
the season. Burke had a try at the local
game during the days of the Bay District
track and after contributing in the neigh
borhood of $25,<ViO for the good of the
snortr left for the 'East. He is now one of
the stars on the metropolitan tracks,
making a very big book, and is popular
with all classes of snorti-men.
If the yarns told about racing on the
N*ew York tracks can be believed the
sport there must be in a bad way. Rougn
riding is indulged in to a noticeable de
gree, so the story goes. Horses run first
one day and last the next time out, a cer
tain clique does about a.s It pleases. Pittb
burg Phil "hollers" but gets the coin, and
many other refreshing things are men
tioned. It would bÂ»Â» oulte a Joke on the
Jockey Club officials if they would yet
have to journey to this; far Western coun
try to get a few pointers.
All starters are notional: there was
never nn exroptlon. Last meeting at Tan
foran Park Dick Dwyer's efforts with the
Australian gate with one or two excep
tions were excellent. Still he was not
happy. There ever lingered ln his mind
the thought that a 4 to 5 choice might
meet with some accident and be left. Pos
sibly h*Â» ha* been told strange tales about
the wild and woolly Westerner and In his
dreajns haÂ« visions of a man with a red
flag in his hand pursued by five hundred
demoniacal looking Individuals and look
ing for a loosÂ© board fn tho fence. There
is not the least danger of anything lik^
this occurring, still Mr. Dwyer has asked
to be allowed the use of the recall flag.
On the other hand, wn<-n James F. Cald
well starts for the post he picks up tha
recall Jlag. giving it a look not unlike the
one a married man confers on his moth
er-in-law, who drops In at his home just
to spend a month or two., As Mr. Cald
well detests the red bunting and his work
tho last week has not been up to his high
standard. It looks as -f the Oakland man
agement will be compelled to let the
"Prince" have his own way.

Sloan Intends Having a Talk With
th'e Stewards.
NEW YORK. Dec. 7.â Lester Relff. the
jockey, was interviewed to-day, concern
ing the decision of the English Jockey
Club in his case. He refused to discuss
the Sloan decision. He said:
"The ""stewards of the .English Jockey
Club are undeniably fair. Tnat they
would exonerate me I knew in advance.
There was nothing else for them to do.
I have heard a lot of talk about Mr.
Croker bringing suit against the jockey
club on account of these charges and alsj
that I should contemplate the same thing.
I cannot' speak for Mr. Croker, of course,
although l doubt that he intends to do
anything of the kind, but for myself I
can say that I have no thought ot suing
and I cannot see exactly on what ground
1 could do it."
Danny Maher will accompany Sloan to
the Pacific Const.
CHICAGO, Dec. 7.â James Tod Sloan,
accompanied by a retinue of servants, ar
rived from New York this afternoon and
was driven to the Auditorium Annex.
Sloan professed to worry little over
Thursday's reported action of the Eng
lish racing stewards, declaring that he
would be persona non grata if he applied
for a jockey's license next season. He de
clares that he yet expects to ride in Eng
land. Failing in this he will return to his
humble starting place in America, or per
chance try his fortunes in France.
Sloan will remain in the city until next
Tuesday, when he will pay a day's visit
to his old home at Kokomo. Ind., return
ing in time for the Gans-McGovern fight
next Thursday night, and then proceeding
to the Pacific Coast, where hi hopes to
accept a few mounts.
In regard to the announcement in the
Racing Calendar, .Sloan said:
"Naturally it is a subject upon which I
careUo say little. I have not been rulad
off, and yet if i apply for a license I am
to be refused. I must wait for a definite
announcement. The only change in my
f>lans will be that I shall return to Eng
and earlier, try to. have a talk with the
stewards and atony rate ask for a hear
ing." Â¦

WILLIAM GIBSON
IS BREAKING DOWN
MAHT6VILLE, Ky., Dec. 7.â Willia.n
Gibson, who is charged with the murder
of his stepdaughter at Cattlettsburg, Ky.,
two weeks ago, is breaking down and a
confession from him is expected at any
moment. There is no indication to-night
of a mob coming from Cattlettsburg as
was reported early ln thÂ«! day.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 7.-A rumor was
current to-day that the telegraph opera
tors employed by the Sacta Fc on its lines
west of Albuquerque were preparing to
strike. General Manager Kevin, In an in
terview regarding the matter, made the
following statement:
"Regarding strike rumors on Santa Fe
lines west of Albuquerque, the facts are
That the telegraph operators on the Gulf.
Colorado and Santa Fe struck yesterday
because that line, which Is one of the At
chison system lines, would not agree to
give them a different schedule, so far as
rules and regulations are concerned, than
that which is in force on the Atchison.
ToDeka. and Santa Fe proper and the At
chison system lines west of Albuquerque.
A schedule, which, as a matter of fact is
a contract, was entered into and executed
between the operators on the Santa *e
Pacific. th*> Southern California and the
Ban Francisco and San Joaquin Valley
raUroadp, within the past two weeks. In
which, among othr-r thing*, it was agreed
that ih!s contract would be respected by
both parties to It until thirty days' notice
had betn given In writing by either party
to the other of the desire to cancel or in
any part modify. It is the intention of the
Santa Fe Ganerai Manager
Talks of Gulf Road
Strike.
NEVIN'S ADVICE
TO OPERATORS
railroad company to respect and carry
Out thie, as well as all other portions of
the contract, and it cannot be violated by
the telegraphers, except at the sacrifice
of their integrity and honesty of purpose;
and I am loth to believe that any such
dishonorable action upon their part will
be taken. There are absolutely no differ
ences between the telegraph oprators on
the Atchlson system lines west of Albu
querque and the management, and the
one cause that could be assigned for a
strike on these lines would be one of sym
pathy for the Gulf. Colorado and Santa
Fe Railway Company's telegraph opera
tors.
"If by following bad advice the tele
praph operators Btrine it will, of course,
primarily annul the contract referred to
and will cost every striker his position,
which will brln*r in its train much suffer
ing for tnese men and their families, and
it is sincerely to be hoped that each tele-
Rraph operator interested will do his own
thinking and not be firulded in reaching
an opinion by the advice of some irre
sponsible demagogue and labor agitator."
Captain Ault claims the bass record of
the year. While fishing off the wharf at

CHRISTMAS

ON GRIDIRON
Opinion at Stanford Is
That Columbia Col
lege Team Will
Come West.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Cal.. Dec.
7. â Manager Gildersleeve Is still In com
munication with Columbia In regard to
the proposed Stanford-Columbia game,
but nothing definite has been heard as
yet. It Is the general opinion here, how
ever, that Columbia will accept, and a
game will be played In San Francisco on
Christmas day and one in Ix>s Angeles on
New Year's.
The sentiment is strongly in favor of
such a game, nearly all of the varsity
players being in favor -of it. Columbia's
proposition was to play for 75 per cent
of the gate receipts and pay all her own
expenses. By this proposition Stanford
could not possibly lose and Columbia
would probably make money. The game
should draw as large a crowd as the Cal
ifornia-Carlisle game. Columbia has a
strong team, rated as at least the third
strongest team in the Kast, If not the
second. She defeated Tale, the strongest
team in the East, in the early part of the
season. Two^of her players are on the

Rich and Poor Alike Suffer From
Catarrh in This Climate.
AH observant physicians have noticed
the enormous increase ln catarrhal dis-
eases in recent years, and the most liberal
and enlightened have cheerfully given
their approval to the new Internal rem-
edy Stuarfs Catarrh Tablets, as the most
successful and by far the safest remedy
for catarrh yet produced.
One well-known catarrh specialist, as
soon as he had made a thorough, test of
this preparation, discarded inhalers,
washes and Hprays and now depends en-
tirely upon Stuart's Catarrh Tablets in
treating catarrh, whether in the head,
throat or stomach. -
â¢Dr. Risdell says: In patients Â¦who had
lost the sense of smell entirely, and even
where the hearing has begun to* be af-
fected from catarrh, I halve had fine re-
sults after, only a few weeks' use of Stu-
arfs Catarrh Tablets. ' I can only explain
their action on the theory that the cleans-
Ing and antiseptic properties of the tablets
destroy the catarrhal germs wherever
found because I have found the tablets
equally valuable in catarrh of the throat
and stomach as in nasal catarrh."
Dr Estabrook says Stuart s Catarrh
Tablets are especially useful in nasal ca-
tarrh and catarrh of the throat, clearing
the membranes of mucus and speedily
overcoming the hawking, coughing and
expectorating. ;
Any sufferer from catarrh will find Stu-
art's Catarrh Tablets will give immediate
relief and being in tablet form and pleas-
ant to .the taste are convenient and al-
ways ready for use. as they can be car-
ried In tlte pocket and used at any time,
as'"*hey contain- no .poisonous drugs, but
only the cleansing antiseptic properties of
eucalyptus bark, guaiacol, blood root and
sell the tablets at 50 cents
for complete treatment.

ADVERTISEMENTS.The contumacy of Wells, Fargo & Co., however,
presents a phase of the law which may become a suK
ject of future judicial consideration.. If that corpora
tion should increase its rates so as to avoid judgment
in future suits, such as.ha9 been instituted by Mr.
Farrell, it is barely possible that a contest might be
arranged which^would call in question the reasonable
ness of its action. The original investment of Wells,
Fargo & Co. was about $500,000. Last year the
profits of the corporation amounted to about
$1,000,000. Is it reasonable for a corporation which
is making a million a year upon so much water as
there is evidently in this one to increase its rates so
as to compel its patrons to pay its taxes? In short,
would such action constitute a reasonable exercise of
the power granted by the Supreme Court of the
United States, in. the Maynard case?
We do not think the courts would stand such a
In the case of the American Express Company vs.
Maynard the Supreme Court of the United States de
cided that the burden of any stamp tax imposed by
Congress could be shifted by the taxpayer so long
as the process of shifting does riot constitute. extor
tion. This ruling, as we understand it, amounts to
this: If- Congress were to require Wells, Fargo &
Co. to put a $5 stamp upon every receipt or bill of
lading issued by it, the shifting process could not.be
resorted to to evade the tax, because an increase of
$5 on every rate would make it unreasonable for the
express company to shift the burden by increasing its
rates. t
If this incorrigible tax-shirker desires to perma
nently avoid the penalty of its contumacy in resisting
the payment of its war taxes it may increase its tariif
rates and thus make up the amount from the pockets
of its patrons. Instead of charging 25 cents for a
package of merchandise, for instance, it may charge
26 cents, and, with the one cent thus extorted, buy
a stamp and stick it upon the bill of lading.
Mr. Farrell's suit to recover five cents alleged
to have been illegally extorted for war taxes. Of
course the corporation can confess judgment and re
turn the five cents, but we do not refer- to that, as a
feasible plan of evading the issue.
THERE is but one avenue of escape for Wells,
Fargo & Co. from the dilemma presented by
d T0X-SHIRKER'S DILEMMA.
China has agreed to every demand of the allied
powers except the payment of an indemnity and the
punishment of her murderous subjects. If she could
only induce the rest of us to adopt resolutions of
thanks that we are alive the farce would be com

pleasure with which at this time they go about the
glad work of preparing for the Christmas season.
To the members of the committee, I. W Hellman
Claus Spreckels, A. A. Watkins, F. W. Dohrmann
and Charles Nelson, special credit is due for their
work in organizing and promoting the plan of relief.
These gentlemen have large interests of their own to
look after, and many claims upon their time, their
energy and their thoughts. It is therefore a matter
of gratification that they turned aside from their per
sonal affairs to direct and aid in a public work of this
kind.
Hardly any comment is needed upon a matter of.
this kind, and yet it should not be permitted to pass
unnoted. Liberality and helpfulness are character
istics of the American people. No surprise is felt
when large sums are raised in any part of the Union
for the relief of sufferers in another part of our com
mon country.. We are in the habit of doing such
things, as were our fathers before us. Still, when such
things are done on a scale so large as to show the co
operation of thousands of people, it is expedient that
public commendation be given to the helpers in ''order
that all may understand in how much of honor liber
ality is held -by Americans.

These moderate admissions by a foreign organ that
has access to the facts should surely impress the
occidental world. The "interpolation" in the treaty
of i860 was a plain forgery, done by a French mis
sionary. If the powers would keep that fact in
mind they might be less strenuous in their demand
for reprisal.
The Shanghai Press, the organ of the foreign
population and interests of Shanghai, in an article on
the history of Christian missions in China says: "The
claim of the missionaries to a right to enter the Middle
Kingdom is founded on no higher authority than an
irterpolation by a missionary translator into the Chi
nese text of the treaty of i860 between France and
China. It was clearly contemplated by the allies
(France and England) that missionaries were to re
ceive protection only in the treaty ports and their
neighborhood, but ardent missionaries have been
only too glad to take advantage of any justification
for extending their sphere of work. The Chinese
have watched with much concern the sequence of
eventsâ first the missionary, then the Consul, and at
last the invading army. The Christian religion spread
at first chiefly, if not entirely, among the poorer
classes, until it was gradually discovered that politi
cal advantage accrued to the convert. It is not diffi
cult to deny that the Christians enjoy special privi
leges, but the fact remains that many people in trou
ble seek to enter the church. The very precautions
taken by some missionaries to ascertain whether an
'inquirer* has any litigation pending afford some in
sight into the real position of the Christian church in
China. We cannot wonder that the Chinese officials
should hate the missionaries. Their church is an
impcrium in imperio. The missionaries are not
amenable to Chinese law, and in some cases havs
acted in a high-handed manner in protection of their
converts." 'y,. ' .".
This country can consider equities that arc not
thought of by the other powers. Among these the
strongest originates in the remote cause of the whole
trouble. It came about through missionary invasion
of the Middle Kingdom.
Instead of having any territorial designs, our Gov
ernment has strenuously labored to preserve the in
tegrity of China and to reinstate its responsible Gov
ernment. This accords with the wish of the Ameri
can people.
It is hoped now that light has broken upon that
dark situation, and that justice and mercy will go
hand in hand in the final settlement. We took occa
sion recently to deny the yellow story from Washing

a port and a province as the American share of the

LIGHT IN CHINA.
It is to be borne in mind it is not expected the
protective principle will win in the present fight All
that the advocates of the principle hope for is the pre
sentation of such an array of strength as will com
pel the two great parties to take sides and bring the
issue fairly before the people. It is that fact which
gives international interest to the present session.
Great Britain is so rich that the mere question of
raising money in itself would not be a matter of much
concern except to financiers who expect to profit by
the Government loan, but a revival of a demand for
protection in the kingdom interests all the great na
tions. .. â¢
One of the interesting features of the situation is
that the Tories, the old protection party, now being
in power, will doubtless be forced to maintain the ex
isting order of things and uphold. free trade; while
the Liberals, whose predecessors fought the battle for
free trade, may be compelled by . the exigencies of
politics to adopt at least so much of protection as is
known to the British public as "fair trade"â that is,
a trade based on reciprocity treaties.
The advocates of customs duties have two argu
ments. One is the economic fact that revenues can
be most readily increased in that way. The other is
that by the imposition of duties on imports Parliament
can provide discriminating duties in favor of the colo
nies and thus strengthen the unity of the empire.
t Thus appeals are to be made both to the pockets and
to the patriotism of the people, and it is believed a
strong support for the protective policy will be de
veloped.
That fact, however, does not imply a dull session.
Unless all reports from London have been ill-founded,
there is going to be a vigorous effort made to induce
the Ministry to raise the additional revenue by cus
toms duties instead of by increasing domestic taxes.
In other words, it is expected that "the question of
free trade or protection is to be made once more a
vital issue in British politics, and as any considerable
departure from the free trade policy of the country
would have far-reaching effects, the debates of the
session will be watched with interest throughout the
world.
The fact that the revenue requested is for the ex-,
penses of the war in South Africa gave the opposition
an opportunity to discuss the war and the policy of
the Ministers in relation to it, and reports show they,
made full use of the advantage. It is stated the de
bates both in the Lords and in the Commons were
among the most exciting of recent years. It is not
likely, however, there will be much speech-making of
that kind during the session. Parliament has .been
convoked for a special purpose, and the Ministry has
at its back a majority strong enough to hold the dis
cussion strictly to that one subject.

PHILADELPH IA ICONOCLAST
TAKES A RAP AT HISTORY
Liberty Bell Custodian Finds a Very Un
sentimental Document.
THE iconoclast has taken another rap at history, eays a writer in the
Philadelphia Times. Superintendent Reeves of the 'old Independence
Hall in Philadelphia has discovered in the archives of the place a framed
parchment which questions the story of the blue-feyed messenger hoy and
the old be'lman waiting in the steeple for the signal that the Declaration
of Independence had been signed. \ â¢
This parchment, estimated to be at least 100 years old,' has a lock of g-olden
hair fastened to ic and underneath the Inscription: "From that blue-eyed boy who
did not run and tell the bellrjnger to ring the State House bell on the glorious
Fourth of July, 1<,6, the saicl4>ell not having been run unttl the 8th of July, when
the declaration was first read to the people."
Superintendent Reeves does not question the authority of the parchment, es
pecially in view of a certain shade of doubt that prevjously had enveloped the
story. :.â¢--.'

~ I "HE verdict of the Coroner's jury in, the case of
the glass works' tragedy on Thanksgiving, day
A . puts the blame for their misfortune on the vic
tims themselves, dead and living. It was in evidence
that the superintendent and watchman of the glass
works forbade entry to the crowd and resisted it as
long as possible, finding it impossible, however, to
turn the heedless rush. The melancholy tragedy was
caused by the undisciplined enthusiasm of a trespass
ing cro.vd, many of whom went to their death
against the rightful authority and warning of the
proper agents of the owners of the property.
Looking at the awful affair with what calmness one
may command, it seems to enforce the need of a dis
cipline in our public schools which will induce a
higher respect for the rights of person and property.
Daring and adventure are American traits. They go
into the hardy character of our countrymen and are
illustrated in the incidents of private life as well as on
the battle-field. Indeed it may be said that Americans
possess them in such excess that, unless tHey arc
brought under discipline, they may balance the bene
fit of their possession by harm that comes of their
exercise. '[Â¦'â.
The purpose of our common schools is'not only to
impart learning, in order that the Government may
rest upon a high average of intelligence among the
people, but also to bring about the possession in com
mon of certain motives,- as the master motives of in
dividual and national life.
This may be done by school training in behavior,
that wiir inculcate respect for the rights of. others.
The only way in which one man can be entirely sure
of the safe exercise of his .own rights is by respecting
the same rights in his neighbor. Now that it is ap
parent that our system of common schools is attract
ing the attention of the world, and that the force and
effectiveness of our people are being ascribed to the
discipline which it enforces and the average intelli
gence that it imparts, it is good time to treat many
incidents, lik'e this local tragedy, and many outbreaks
of the various passions, as evidence that the schools,
excellent as their work is, are still short of accom
plishing their full purpose.
If the idea had been well grounded in that unfortu
nate crowd that it was wrong to set foot upon prop
erty against the protest of its owner, no policeman
would have been required to stop the mad rush to
destruction. The feeblest refusal of the right to enter
would have been instantly recognized as a voice ut
tering the sacred rights of property, and the enthusi
astic curiosity of the crowd would have been" at once
under the control of discipline, and more than a
score of homes would not to-day, be somber with
mourning and sorrow.
It is coming to be noticed that American youth is
rebellious to proper authority, is confused in its ideas
of the rights of others 2nd lacking in respect for age.
Works of art placed for the pleasure and instruction
of the public are not safe from defacement, and pub
lic and private grounds are invaded, defiled and dese
crated, in disregard of the rights and interests of the
It has been demonstrated too often that home dis
cipline is frequently powerless against the habit and
public opinion of the school. Grown men depart
from the right line. under the pressure of the opinion
of their associates, and youths do the same andsforthe
same reason.
This is not intended as an unkindly comment on the
dead and the wounded who went heedlessly to their
doom and their injury. But it is the duty of the press
to find the cause of such sad events and advise means
for preventing their recurrence.
We have science, art, literature in our schools. In
deed, we have a curriculum which can stand unload
ing of much that it carries. Cannot more attention
be given to inculcating manners and 'self-control,
without abating any attention now given to learning?
Many men and women there are without learning
who are models of self-respect and self-control and
can be trusted to maintain their own rights by de
fending the rights of others.
If more attention can be given to the discipline
which implants these sentiments in our coming gen
erations, the character of the future American will
lose none of its strength, nor its independence, dar
ing and adventure, but, possessing all these, will
adorn and strengthen them by their exhibition as
powers and capacities under discipline.
SCHOOL DISCIPLINE.
But there is little or no danger of the corporation
disputing the assertion. President Valentine knows

strate his financial ability to 1 discharge his public du

The artist of the early days of Punch'
was John Leech, the most genuine humor
ist among the English artists. For twen
ty-five years his cartoons and comment)
were the life of 'the great comic journal.
Leech had not the imagination and thg
power of hia famous contemporary,
Cruikshank, but he was much more hu
man and genuinely humorous. Hla
sketches are seldom merely comic and
farcical; one cannot say in the words of
Dundreary: "No fellah ever saw such a
fellah. Gwoss carwlcatawaw." Leech
was as close an observer as England has
ever produced; he studied actual men and
women in every station of life and he de
picted them without exaggeration. His
sketches form an album of the actual
England of the middle vears of the- cen
tury; they are a series of portraits so
skillfully done as to show the underlying
evil or folly or pathos. His sketches for
The most prominent figure among the

English humor during- the middle years
of the nineteenth century centered about
the humorous periodical Punch. The dis
tinctively comic journal Is of compara
tively recent origin. In the latter part
of the eighteenth century the London
datllea began to make more and more
of the humorous column. The paragraph
In Its modern sense â the brief and witty
anecdote â became, a mechantable com
modity, and as a result there arose a new
profession. Charles Lamb has charming
ly discussed the journalism of this early
period:
Every montnx paper, aa an essential re
tainer to Its establishment, 'kept an author
who was bound to furnish dally a quantum or
witty paragraphs. Sixpence a Jokeâ and it was
thought pretty high, tooâ was Den Stuart's
settled remuneration In these cases. The chat
of the day. scandal, but above all dress, fur
nished the material. The length of no para
graph was to exceed seven lines; shorter they
might bt, but they must be poignant.
Lamb himself waa for a time "profes
sional wit, wringing out coy sprightll
ness" for the Post and other papers, and
hard Indeed did he find the task. "Xo
Egyptian taskmaster ever devised a
slavery like to that slavery." "Somebody
has said that to swallow six cross buna
daily consecutively for a fortnight would
surfeit the stoutest digestion. But to
have to furnish as many Jokes dally, and
that not for a fortnight but for a long
twelvemonth, as we were constrained to
do, was a little harder exaction." Lamb
was thus a pioneer in a profession that
to-day counts Its members by the thou
sands. All through the century there has
been on the part of the periodical press
a constantly increasing demand for witty
paragraphs, illustrated Jokes, ludicrous
verses, elaborated puns, and comic ma
terial generally, until to-day It la posi
tively wearisome In its profusion.
The establishing of Punch in July, 1841,
marks the beginning of the era of the
periodical devoted exclusively to wit and
humor. Punch was the first really suc
cessful En&llsh comic paper. The early
days of this great publication were by
no means bright or promising. There had
gradually grown at the "Shakespeare's
Head"' in Wych street a little band of
wits and writers drawn together largely
by the magnetism of the witty and Jovial
landlord, Mark Lemon, and once after a
particularly brilliant evening some one
in a moment of Inspiration suggested that
the opinions and fancies of the little com
pany, especially upon political subjects,
be preserved in a sheet to be published
regularly by the club. The suggestion
found approval: each of the members of
the little band promised to contribute of
his best, and the host, even as in Chau
cer's "Tales," agreed to become the ruler
and arbitrator of the literary feast, or
in other words, to be the first editor of
the paper. -.'-'-
The new periodical received the name
Punch after the well known British nur
sery hero, and it published for its early
numbers contributions from Douglas Jer
rold, Albert Smith, Gilbert a Becket, John
Leech, Thomas Hood and many others.
After the second volume Thackeray be
came a regrular contributor. The week
ly gatherings at the "Shakespeare's
Head now became sessions of thÂ© editor
ial board. At the head of the table sat
the editor and host, Mark Lemon, and
over the wine and walnuts the contribu
tors and guests discussed the policy of
the paper. But despite its , brilliant edi
torial force. Punch was not a successful
venture. It had not yet "found Itself."
It treated largely of politics In a way
that is very blue reading nowadays. "The
illustrations, besides one full-page car
toon, were wretched* little cuts an inch
high scattered through the text." It Is
far from funny, as we view it from the
modern standpoint, and It was evidently
not judged to be supremely funny by its
original readers. Its editors were on the
point of abandoning it, but at the critical
moment two active and enterprising
young printers bought It for Â£100. They
enriched it and changed Its scope, and by
skillful management they averted dis
aster, made the venture at length profit
able and finally they made It the leading
humorous periodical of the English
speaking worldâ a position which it still
holds. Rivals It has had by the score-

NOTICE.
When the "letters" of Miss Martlneau
and Atkinson appeared Jerrold observed
that their creed was: "There Is no God,
and Miss Martlneau is his prophet."
He once defined flattery as "the milk of
human kindness turned to butter."
Jerrold will be longest remembered, no
doubt, for his "Mrs. Caudle's Curtain Lec
tures." No other English humorous crea
tion, save Pickwick perhaps, has been so
completely successful. "They just hit the
reading. English, always domestic In their
literary as in their other tastes," and they
are even now read and laughed at. The
sorely tried man who received these night
ly lectures is said to have been Jerrold
himself, and doubtless many of the scold
ings were richly deserved. The kindly hu-
Jerrold, who was undoubtedly the leading
English wit during the middle years of
the century. Jerrold's contributions to
Punch were exceedingly numerous. Series
after series of comic sketches flowed from
his penâ "Punch's Letters to His Son,"
"Punch's Complete Letter-Writer," "The
Twelve Labprs of Hercules," "Autobiogra
phy of Tom Thumb" and "Mrs Caudle's
Curtain Lectures" are but the beginning
of the list. During the Mrs. Caudle se
ries the circulation of Punch reached Its
highest point.
As a humorist Jerrold was In many re
spects the successor of Sydney Smith. He
was electric in repartee and merciless in
satire. Few other men have had such com
mand of all the resources of sarcasm. He
was master in the use of irony and innu
endo, and he could be as cruel In retort
as Swift or Dr. Johnson. Yet Jerrold had
a heart as tender as a child's. "This wit
and bon-vlvant." said one who knew him
intimately, "the merriest and wittiest man
of the company, would cry like a child as
the night drew on and the talk grew seri
ous. No theory could be more false than
that he was a cold-blooded satirist â sharp
as steel is sharp from being hard. The
basis of his nature was sensitiveness and
impulsiveness."
Of Jerrold's repartee not much has been
preserved, yet the little that we have is
eminently satisfying:
"Be careful, waiter," said Fltzbull. the
dramatist. "Remember, I have got a head
on my shoulders." "Don't boast, Fitz, my
boy," cried Jerrold; "I think you have
only got a pimple on your shoulder, which
will never come to ahead."

and English ideas is written with fuUne33

DICKENS, FORSTER, STANFIELD AND MACLISE. IN CORNWALL
AFTER A FAC-SIMILE OF A SUPPOSED SKETCH OF WILLIAM
MAKEPEACE THACKERAY.
Punch comprise) the graver and more seri
ous part of his life> work. There Is some
times actual pathos In some o'f the studies
of lowly life; there is sometimes a trua
sermon hidden In what at first seems a
piece of mere fun.
The humorous poet of the> early Punch
group was unquestionably Thomu Hood.
His Influence was not Ions: felt by thd
journal, for hÂ© died In 1S45, yet thÂ© mere
fact that "The Sons of thd Shirt" ap
peared originally In Punch Is In Itself
enough to glorify It and raise It above th-Â»
multitude of merely comic papers.
Hood's whole lifÂ© waa a battle with pov*
erty. Ho attempted to support himself
with his pen and as a result he did an
immense amount of mere hack work. Ha
was a professional funny man for the
papers and as such he produced an abund
ance of comic trash long ago forgotten.
Even the selected material In "Hood'3
Own" and other similar Joke books is,
much of It, of very uncertain, merit. It
shows Its author to have been a mere lit
erary clown who madÂ© puns and jokes
solely for pay.
Yet there was true humor In Hood. In
his best work, which was ever in verse,
he reveals to us a delicacy and a refine
ment and a pathos rarely found in liter
ature. By a handful of true- lyrics Hood
raised himself to a place besldÂ© the few
great humorists of the world. One cannot
read him without sighing: that his lot
should have been cast in a place that for
bade frequent use of hiÂ» bÂ«st powers.
Among the later contributors to Punch
may be mentioned Thackeray, who con
tributed no less than eight series of pa
pers, besides many drawings: Tom Tay
lor, Shirley Brooks and Du Maurier.
whose impress is on the later history of
the periodical even as Leech's Is upon the
earlier years. Punch has ever been bold
and progressive, advocating ever In poll
tics, literature and art the most enlight
ened, and advanced Ideas. Durng the last
sixty years thÂ© history not only of Engr-

The afternoon session was ODexi&d vrUh.
Resolved, That this resolution be presented
to our State Legislature by a committee com
posed of the present committee on legislation
appointed by this convention, and that a copy
of theso resolutions be transmitted to each
member of the California Congressional dele
gation.
A resolution recommending the adoption
by the Legislature of a bill formulated by
the Cooper Ornithological Club for the
protection of birds caused some discus
sion. The bill contains a clause allow
ing the killing Â¦ of "English sparrows or
any bird where found destroying, fruits,
berries or grain crops, except by poison."
Professor E. J. Wickson objected to tne
poison clause, as he considered that
method of getting rid of destructive birds
sometimes necessary.
W. O. Emerson of Haywards contended
that poison killed the birds that the fruit
growers desired most to protect. H. R
Dakin of Santa Cruz County said that hla
apricots and corn would be destroyed by
blue jays if he were not allowed to use
poison to dispose of them. Professor
Ames, the handwriting expert, took a
hand in the discussion. Finally Mr.
Emerson consented to the elimination of
the poison clause, and the resolution was
adopted.
Resolved, That we denounce the principle of
treaties affecting the tariff being negotiated
in secret by our Government; and be it fur
ther.-,â. .: --:Â¦â¢."Â¦;Â¦
Whereas, The fruit growers in annual con
vention assembled, have noted with alarm the
tendency toward the negotiation of commercial
or so-called "reciprocity treaties," which vi
tally effect California and her interests; there
fore, be it
Resolved, That we denounce and protest
against all such treaties which tend to lower
the protective tariff on any American product;
and be it further
As a result of the discussion, the com
mittee on resolutions was Instructed to
embody the sentiment against Kasson's
work in a separate resolution. It did so
in the following resolution, which was re
ported and adopted in the afternoon:
Bedprocity Treaties Condemned.
The report was adopted by unanimous
vote and with very little discussion. The
committee was instructed to assist Sec
retary Lelong in- arranging for the con
ventions provided for In the plan.
A large share of the time of the morn
lrig session and a portion of that of the
afternoon was taken up with the discus
sion of reciprocity treaties. Resolutions
introduced the day before protesting
against the pending reciprocity treaty
with the British West Indies as^ detri
mental to the citrus fruit Interests of
California were adopted, but not until the
sentiment was developed that reciprocity
treaties In general are wrong In principle.
Isador Jacobs, E. F. Adams, George T.
Frost, Captain M. J. Daniels and others
spoke In condemnation of the secret ne
gotiation of such treaties and the sacri
fice of some Interests for the sake of pro
viding a market abroad for the products
of the large corporations. As E. F.
Adams put It: "The principle of recip
rocity as we have it is that John must
give away something in order that Peter
may get something." Incidentally John
A. Kasson, Minister Plenipotentiary of
Treaties, whose secret negotiations are
most objected to, came in for repeated
drubbings at the hands of the fruit
growers.
M. Theo. Kearney, the chairman, ex
plained that "fresh fruit" was used to In
clude deciduous fruit shipped fresh or
sold to canners. He spoke in favor of the
plan, and expressed his regret that so
many of the large growers had been
standmg in their own light by refusing
to co-operate with the smaller producers
to secure prices that would yield a profit.
"The chief obstacle in the past,!' said
Russ D. Stephens of Sacramento, "has
been the large producers. It is easy
enough for Mr. Kearney and Judge Bond
to wash their hands of responsibility for
the success of this plan by informing the
small growers that they must not look to
the large growers to carry it through:
They are the men who are in a position
to reach the large growers and bring
them into line, and that is absolutely es
sential to the su^.ess of this plan."
Chairman Kearney replied that if the
small producers organized and thus be
came an Important factor, the large
growers would be forced to come into the
organization.
Large Growers the Obstacle.
preme Importance to those Industries and to the
general welfare of the State; and we there
fore recommend that the convention:
Firstâ Call a meeting of the delegates of all
the fresh fruit producers of California, to con

to be hereafter announced.
Secondâ That the convention call a meeting of
delegates consisting of one representative from
each of the Industries above enumerated at

THE sub-committee of thÂ« Cali

appointed last April to frame
laws and proposed amendments
to the constitution, relating to
the teachers and schools of the State,
tendered its report yesterday to the com
mission, which met in the rooms of the
Board of Education in the City Hall.

The convention was called to order by
H Weinstock of Sacramento, with G. \V.
Heattie of Berkeley as secretary.
The proposed amendment to the con
stitution permitting State aid for high
schools and technlcaJ schools was sub
mitted by the committee, and though
meeting with the approval of the edu
cators was referred back to the commit
tee for slight changes in the phraseology.
Control of Normal Schools.
The next amendment proposed, whereby
the direction of normal schools was to be
Invested In a board composed of the Gov
ernqr. Superintendent of Public Instruc
tion and sixteen others appointed for a
term of sixteen years, caused a sharp de
bate. S. J. Dailey of San Jose called the
attention of the assemblage to the danger
lurking In the fact of sixteen men con
trolling normal school affairs for such
a long time, even though the amendment
provided that, two of the board should re
tire at the end of eÂ«ch two years. Pro
fessor Cubberley replied to Mr. Dailey.
saying: "We want to get the affairs of
tho nurmal schools of the State In the
hand? of a board whose tenure of office
shall be longer than that of the Governor,
thus curtailing the power of any State
Executive who might wish to control the
schools for sake of patronage."
President David Starr Jordan entered
thÂ«" room during the discussion on hear
ing the proposed change In the laws, and
Joined In the debate.
"Cut the term in half." said Dr. Jor
dan, "and you will get better results. A
good man on the board for the entire
term would be of great benefit, but on
the other hand a bad man would be a
great detriment. Five-year terms, in my
opinion, would be long enough."
The â¢ idea advanced by ' Dr. Jordan
seemed to be satisfactory to all, but when
put to a vote was defeated by three votes
and the committee's recommendation was
adopted.
Parental Schools Discussed.
After several minor questions concern
ing the rights of city and county boards
of education had been discussed and
settled, the question of parental schools
was Introduced.
The section of the proposed constitu
tional amendment referring to the ques
tion of the funds from which the ex
penses of such a school would be de
frayed was referred back to the commit
tee on motion of J. AY*. Llnscott, who de
sired that the sub-committee Incorporate
In the section a paragraph calling for "an
estimate of funds to be submitted to the
city" to defray expenses other than the
payment of salaries of teachers. F. E.
Dunlap and J. W. McClymonds were ap
pointed a committee to furnish Informa
tion as to what constituted a parental
school. The section referring to the em
ployment of children, which would Inter
fere with the enforcement of the compul
sory educational law, was also referred
back to the committee on the ground that
it was unconstitutional, as was also sec
tion 6. which provided for the disposition
of the fines collected from offenders con
victed of violation of the act governing
In* employment of children tinder 14
years of age.
Section 11, giving to any "City Re-
life diplomas to furnish evidence of hav
ing taught a part of each year for ten
years, the aggregate time of teaching be
ing seventy months, be changed to six
years and forty-two months. This was
adopted without discussion.
The report of the committee on section
3of section 16fi3 was discussed at length.
The proposed amendment reads:
The public schools of California, other than
those supported exclusively by the State, shall
be classed as high school*, technical schools,
elementary schools (Including primary and
grammar grader), and kindergarten-primary
FChoolF. and no teacher shall be employed to
teach In any school If the certiflcat- held by
the teacher is of a class below that of a
school to be taught: provided, that the holders
oÂ£ existing primary certificates or of the same
when hereafter renewed, shall be eligible to
teach In any of the first five grades of the
elementary schools of the county. The cpuruy
board of education must, except In Incorporated
cltl<>6 having boards of education, on or be
fore the first day of July of each year, pre
scribe the course of Btudy in each grade of
the elementary schools for the ensuing school
year.
T. J. Kirk, Superintendent of Public
Instruction, said there were teachers In
this State instructing both primary and
grammar grades while holding only a
primary certificate. This was possible In
districts where it was necessary to have
nine grammar grade pupils to form a
grammar grade, any less number being
called a primary class. The amendment
as proposed would be an Injustice to these
teachers. R. M. Shackelford of Paso Ro
blea did not wish legislation against any
particular class of teachers, but believed
that In the treatment of those holding
certificates or diplomas the rights of the
pupils should not be overlooked.
Primary Grade Certificates.
W. D. Kinpsbury gained the floor and
said: 'This matter of primary grade cer
tificates should be allowed to work itself
out. It is only a matter of time when
those holding these certificates will have
enough school teaching experience to en
able them to apply for a higher grade,
and thus reduce the number. There are
only 45 holders of these certificates In
this city, and any legislation against
them will do harm to our other plans.
These 45 teachers were strong enough to
legislate at Sacramento and obtain what
they wanted, and we want no opposition
at the next session, when this report will
be submitted."
The matter was finally settled by chang
ing that part of the amendment affecting
the primary grade certificates, as fol
lows:
Provided, that the holders of existing primary
certificate* or of the same when hereafter re
newed, shall be eligible to teach In ajiy of
the first five grades of the elementary schools
of the county, or In any grade that haa been
designated by the county superintendent as a
primary grade.
The question of special certificates at
tracted the Individual attention of the
entire convention, as In the event of the
proposed amendment being adopted a
number of teachers holding these certifi
cates In case kindergarten grades were
established In the public schools, would be
unable to retain their positions. The dis
cussion- lasted for some time, and was
participated In by Professor Brown W
D. Klngsbury and T. J. Kirk. A motion
to adjourn until 10 a. m. to-day cut the

devolved the entire remodeling of the
school laws consleted of the following-

corder. Justice of the Peace or other city
magistrate" jurisdiction over the viola
tors of the enforced education law, was
adopted.
On motion cf Professor Brown the deci
sion of the convention to take up the re
port as submitted was reconsidered and
the proposed amendments to sections 1503,
1521. 166a. 1770. 1771, 1772 and 1775. relating to
the Issuing cf diplomas, was taken up.
A communication concerning these
amendments from a committee appointed
at the last meeting of the Sacramento
Teachers' Institute was read. The letter
stated that many of the amendments pro
posed at the last convention would work
a great Injustice to hundreds of teachers
throughout the State, and recommending
to the sub-committee changes that would
not prove harmful to any holders of diplo
mas. Discussion developed the fact that
the memorial of the Sacramento teachers
had been anticipated and the changes
feared wera not made in the persent re
port.
Granting of Diplomas.
Section 5 of the proposed amendment to
section 1503, reading as follows, was next
brought up:
Said diploma of graduation from any State
normal Fchool in thls> State, when. accompanied
by a document granted by the faculty of the
State university, showing that the holder of
ruch diploma has successfully completed the
course of Instruction in said university pre
scribed for students who are graduates of a
normal school of this State, shall entitle euch
holder to a high school certifiente authorizing
the holder to teach In any elementary school,
and In any high school in this Slete In which
eald holder is not required to t*acb languages
other tHan the Knglish.
This was objected to by Professor Cub
berly on the ground that it afforded a
cheap and i-asy manner of obtaining a
diploma. His views were concurred in by
Messrs. Anderson, McClymonds and LJns
cott, and on motion of the latter the sec
tion was stricken out.
Section 2, providing that the credentials
upon which persons may be certificated
to teach In the high schools in this State
must be the equivalent of a diploma of
graduation from the University of Cali
fornia, with a recommendation of the fac
ulty thereof, was adopted after a short
discussion.
Classes of Life Diplomas.
The convention decided to recommend
the granting of life diplomas. In four
grades, ns follows:
High school â Authorizing the holder to teach
In Â«ny elementary school or In any hlKh school.
Elementary schoolâ Authorizing the holder to
teach In any elementary school. .
Kindergarten primaryâ Authorizing the hold
er to teach in any kindergarten primary.
Specialâ Authorizing the holder to teach In
any school such special branches and In such
grades as are named on such diploma.
It was recommended by the committee
ihat a four-tlfths vote of all the members
of a county or city and county board of
education be necessary to secure the
granting of a diploma,, but this was
amended to read "a three-fourths vote,"
on motion of W. D. Kingsbury. who con
tended that a three-rtfths vote in case of
tho absence cf one or more members of a
board would delay the granting of the
diploma and prove an Injustice to the ap
plicant. Klnt,sbury cited several cases in
support of his motion.
It was moved by J. W. Lfnscott of Santa
Cruz that the law requiring applicants for

Manager Leahy
Po i Is the
Plot.
DOC" LEAHV, manager of the
Tivoli. thinks George Bowles, as
sistant manager of the Alice
Nielsen Company. Is a "srood fel
low." but just the same he ha*
decided not to give him any more boxes
i ear the stage of tho opera-house. When
Bowles arrived in town Leahy was one
cf the first old friend* whom he met. He
vÂ»as invited to come to the Tivoli and see
the Fhow at any lime. Bowles, accom
panied by Manager Pcrley of the Nielsen
corrpany. availed himself of the invita
tion. They were given a box next the
Ktape and they wen- thÂ» most interested
members of the audience. When the
choniÂ« girls cam? on Bowles was in
FCtrtacy. and immediately began laying his
plans to secure four of the cutest beauties
for h'.a company.
A day or tÂ«o after the visit of Perley
and Bowles to the T:voll Manager Leahy
vi as standing outsidf the Columbia wher.
ho was surpriped to see Mabel Milliard,
Annabolle Gordon, Jtistina Wayne and
Blanche Woodman, the stars of hln
Chorus, float up to the box offlce of the
theater. He thougn; they were just buy
ing scats and dismissed the Incident from
his mind. Soon after Charlie Krause,
the treasurer of the Tivoli. was walking
up Powell street and was surprised to see
the dashing female quartet come out of
the stage door of ;hc- Columbia.
They caught slg.it of Krause and im-
EBedfately proceeded to unbosom them
ee|vÂ«* to him. They said Bowles liac 1 .
offered thÂ«:m a swell -r.gagement and that
they had accepted h;s oner. He had
tempted tiifm with a promise of a trip to
I>.'iidon With the Alice Nielsen Company.
He iold them of tho glories of St. Pauls
Cathedral and the British Museum and
wound up by declaring that if they were
real wise they might land a real live lord.
The offer was too tempting and they hao
decided to accept It
KrauRe reported the matter to Leahy
ami a council of war was held. Leahy
was in favor of oratorical persuasion as
tlir best means of unuoing Bowles* work.
That Bight he went back on the stage and
l;ad a "neart-to-heai t talk" with the girls,
lie told them that the Tivoli was their
home, that Bowles was just handing
them hot air and tfint they should not
treat his offer with j-eriousness. Leahy's
eloquence was iriesisible. The girls
were dissolved in tears and In broken sobs
declared they could never, never leave
uear old Frisco.
Bowles eays he ip sorry that the girls
will not join his company, but that the
effort to win them over was perfectly
lesltimate. He claims that Barnabee of
the Bostontans, when the Nielsen com
pany was playing in St. Louis, tried to
secure some of his shapely chorus girls
for the Bostonians and he thought he
would emulate Barnabee'3 example.
Bowles Essays
to Lure Them
From Tivoli.
Passing out examination questions to fa
vored pupils . 1-efore examinations were
held Is another charge made against the
management of the College of Physicians
and Surgeons, of which Dr.' and Colonel
Winslow Anderson is the head and gen
eral manager.
These questions, while not written In the
exact verbiage of those used in the ex
amination proper, were so closely allied in
substance that none who had an opportu
nity to cram for a few days could possi
bly fall. Xot all the students got these
questions. That is what makes some of
them talk out of school. Some of those
who got them seemed not averse to al
lowing their less favored brethren to en
joy their superior pull from considerations
of affection or something more tangible.
It is current talk among the undergrad
uates, both of the medical and dental de
partments, that the questions were hand
ed around during the time preceding the
last commencement. The "frat men," aa
were commonly known, those who com
prised the favored few. first obtained the
questions, and then disposed of them as
they saw fit. The men outside of the
'frat had to get them as best they could.
This was particularly true in the dentai
department, and men who have had ex
perience in other colleges do not hesitate
to say that gross favoritism was shown
In the graduation of candidates. They
say that while the college prospectus an
nounces that there is plenty of clinical
material to be had in the neighborhood
without interfering with the practice of
other physicians, still unless they brought
in their own subjects they were afforded
but little opportunity for actual work.
Some of these etudents, tiring of this lack
of work, made complaint and were penal
ized in standing therefor. So obnoxious
became these petty annoyances that a
large number left the college and sought
other schools.
Another feature of the case is the po
litical side, in which the old question of
the right of the city to maintain a quar
antine, together with that of the Federal
Orovernment, on the bay of San Fran
cisco was raised. Dr. Anderson was one
of the lobbyists in the matter.
A bill amending section 3009 of the Po
litical Code was introduced, which gave
the college of Physicians and Surgens a
right to have the same number of in
ternes and students in the City and
County Hospital as were allowed other
institutions. It made no provision for a
quarantine officer, and deprived Dr. Dud
ley, then the superintendent of the hospi
tal, of hie position by reason of a clause
that was inserted.
The bill passed both houses of the Leg-
If 11 "* 5 and flnal ly reached Governor
uudd. It had been amended In committee
to meet the wishes of the local medical
fraternity, but between the time of its
passage and the time that it reached
Governor Budd's hands there was a
change made which took all the essence
of the measure out. An investigation fol
Â«r e ui'i Â£ the blam e was never traced.
U nile the measure was before the Gov
ernor, Dr. Dudley, then the resident phy
slclon In the City and County Hospital:
?/Â¦ iR: J - F ' tz Klbbons of the Board of
Health and others, who were supposed to
have influence with Governor Budd, were
offered chairs in the College of Physicians
and Surgeons. They were barred by their
own action from entering the City and
County Hospital until the local Board of
Health extended that privilege. It is said
that the offer made to Dr. Dudley carried
k. i . a Clalar y larger than that he was
obtaining from the city. The following

and part of the next, when I obtained capa
ble assistants and retired from the classroom.
From the first we had trouble about our
accounts. Some of uÂ» wanted our business
affairs carried on like those or any bus ness
fÂ° nC *. rn -,, but Dr Anderson, who as dean! col
lected all the moneys of the school, claimed
to possess superior knowledge of bookkeeping
and resented as a personal affront any demand
to know anything about the financial affairs
of the college, except what he chose to give
out. A stormy meeting of the faculties forced
the trustees to obtain. an expert and to open
a s*t of books. Mr. D. S. Folger was em
ployed aÂ» expert and It would be amusing to
hear his estimate of Dr. Anderson's queer
methods In bookkeeping for the college The
faculties and the board of y-ustees met at Dr
Anderson s office and accepted the hospltalll
ties of his office in the way of whisky, beer
and cigars, which In a way may account for
the toleration of abuses. Â°
When we got ready to purchase a lot Dr
Anderson said we had Jll,000 on hand.' Oii
that statement we agreed to buy It. but we
were soon told we were short several thou
sand dollars. I did not loan the. college any
money for prudential reasons. Among thf note!

FOUR PRETTY CHORUS GIRLS
ARE NOW VERY REPENTANT
Chief of Police Sullivan Is determined
to prevent the threatened highbinder war
in Chinatown. For the past few days
the rival tongs have been arming them
selves preparatory to a bloody clash.
Chief Sullivan learned of their intentions
and he determined to prevent the threat
ened outbreak.
Accompanied by one of his trusted men
the Chief visited Chinatown yesterday
and personally Interviewed the presidents
of the bloodthirsty factions. They as
sured him that there would be no trouble,
but as it was apparent that they were
making preparations for a desperate bat
tle the Chief warned them that he would
not tolerate any breach of the peace, even
at the cost of arresting every member of
the highbinder organizations. After some
discussion the heads of the rival factions
faithfully promised to meet the Chief at
11 o'clock this morning at his office and
agree on some compromise.
The fact that a. number of desperate
highbinders from Sacramento and other
Interior places have arrived here durln"
the past few days is convincing proof, so
the police think, that "something Is do-
Ing" among the rival highbinder tones
Since the brutal murder of the aÂ«ed
Chinese shoemaker in his shop on Wash
ington street the tongs with which he was
ailliated have been quietly arming them
selves, expectinc that they would short
ly be Called upon to avenge hla tragic
death. The rival tongs learning of their
intentions prepared to do battle.
When the presidents of the rival tonics
meet with Chief Sullivan to-day he In
tends to read the riot act to them.

< OÂ»vJÂ«BI> AH A CO., 1CM JIarkÂ»t Sfc.R V.The line of the investigation into the
values of the Spring Valley Water Com
pany's property by the Board of Super
visors as a committee of the whole last
night was chiefly directed toward an at
tempt to have the officials of the com
pany reduce its figures on the given cost
of the Pllarcitos Creek property. The
testimony developed that six miles of the
thirteen miles of pipe laid in 1S6S had been
taken up and replaced by larger sized pipe,
the cost of which also appeared in the
values given. Heed and Brandensteln, who
conducted most of the examination of the
witnesses, questioned them with a view
to having them acknowledge that the
value of the pipe taken up . should be
stricken out of the original cost. Pelham
Ames, secretary of the company, would
not have it that way.
Ames gave the items of cost of the
Pilarcitos Creek, property as follows:
Land, $lbO.O79 35; tunnels, 12441 22; San Ma
teo and San Andreas tunnel, )T3,624 01;
reservoir. $227,162 07: dam, J223.969 52; pipe
line to city, built in 1S68. $199,606 26; tho
"forebay." $lt.9$2 29; new pipe line, built
in 1897. S.-99.562 88; total. $1,201,427 43. Ames
said no interest had been added to the
original cost.
"There are seven* miles of thirty-inch
pipe in use," said Assistant Engineer Carl
Schussler. "About Â¦'six miles of the. thir
teen miles of pipe orleinally laid has been
taken up and replaced by five and a half
miles of forty-four-inch pipe and 1400 feet
of thirty-seven-inch pipe. The pipe taken
up is now stored In the company's yard. '
Ames was recalled and testified that the
thirty-Inch pipe had been charged to con
struction In 1863 and still appeared under
that account. It was not to be regarded
as having been discarded, as it was ready
to be used at any time for repairs. To a
question asked by Reed whether the pipe
should not be charged to depreciation.
Ames said:
"There Is no depreciation. The old pipe
is still fit to use and will be used. As far
as the books show the pipe is still in use.
I do not know whether the tunnel built
In 1861 Is still In use. No part of the cost
of the Pllarcitos property has been paid
for out of the water rates. â¢ Repair* to
the plant, however, have always been
paid for out of the rates. If any of the
pipo Is taken up and replaced it is charged
to maintenance and does not come out of
the stocks and bonds."
city Engineer Grunsky suggested that
the inquiry be directed toward ascertain
ing the weight and quality of the iron In
the pipe and Ames promised to produce
the specifications In the contracts at the
next meeting.
Assistant Engineer Schussler was of the
opinion that pipe depredated In value ac
cording to the length of time it lies in the
gTotmd. ' The thirty-inch pipe -now re
maining might last . thirty years more,
though it had been in the ground for
thirty-two years past. When Branden
steln endeavored to pin Schussler down to
that admission he said that though he had
been an engineer nine* 1878 he did not
have enough experience to determine how
long wrought iron olpe would last.
Reed drew from Schussler the testimony
that of the two dams designated as "up
per" and "lower" â¢ the "upper" was not
needed. Schussler would not admit that
it was useless, but he said that if the
works were to be constructed over again
the upper dam would not be built, as
there was no necessity for it.

Lum Tu, an aged Chinese farmer of

Judge de Haven yesterday and received
his sentence of deportation to China for
not having caused himself to be regis
tered In accordance with the provisions
of the Chinese exclusion act.
â¢Yu is said to be the victim of spite and
persecution, but there was no help for
him, he having clearly failed to comply
with the law, although through no fault
of hla own. He owned an eight-acre
piece of ground near Bridgeport, which
he had cultivated for the past forty
years, supporting himself by raising
vegetables and selling them to the peo
ple of his neighborhood. A few months
ago certain persons desired to open a road
through Yu b ranch, and he refused the
amount they offered him for the right of
way. Shortly thereafter he was arrested
by the local authorities for not having
been registered. He explained that there
were no Chinese near him. and that he
was Ignorant of what was taking place
In the. great world outside of Mono
County, out Ignorance Is no excuse, and
he has sold his ranch and will go home to
China at the expense of the Government.

'Judge â¢ Cook Falls From a Car on
Way to Hall of Justice
and : Breaks tf~ '
Finger.
Â¦*
The toils of the law were wound more
and more closely about Albert Hoff In
Judge Cook's court yesterday. Witness
after witness gave most damaging testi
mony against the deft-ndant.
During- the afternoon session Attorneys
Hosmer and Schooler became involved In
an altercation and for awhile It looked as
if the wordy war might terminate in seri
ous trouble. ' Police Oriicer Robinson, on
the stand for the prosecution, was cross
examined at great length by Schooler for
the defense. The attorney claimed that
Robinson was not an Impartial witness.
Schooler: began to wax wrath and with
the rise of his Ire ! his questions were
shouted in such a. loud voice that Hos
mer took exception toi the handling of
the witness. Judge Cook reprimanded
Schooler' for his conduct.
On the opening of^ the case yesterday
morning' Dr. Inman completed his testi
mony. He was followed by Antone Gil
lettl, who kept a fruit store at Twentieth
and Guerrero streets at the time of the
murder.- He was called to 803 Guerrero
street as soon as the tragedy was dis
covered. Running upstairs he saw the
body of Mrs. Clute lying on the floor. He
became frightened and left the house and
did not return.
Officer Robinson was the next witness.
He was on duty at the Seventeenth street
station when he was ordered to go to the
scene of the crime'. He arrived at the
house about 5:50 o'clock. He procured a
lamp and with Officers Phelben and Fil
bert went upstairs. They found the body
of Mrs. Clute in the bedroom. After the
Coroner's deputies had taken the body
away he went down to Eighteenth and
Valencia streets and found Foley, who
had been employed by Mrs. Clute to lay
the carpets. He took Foley down to Cap
tain Seymour's office, where he was inter
viewed by Captain Seymour. Under In
structions Robinson went over to Ala
meda to find Hoff. He returned the sama
evening. The next morning he went to
room 110 in the Lindell House, found a
carpet bag lying on the bed and under
instructions took it up to police head
quarters. The bag waa identified as be
longing to Hoff.
John Bouse, the next witness, testified
that. Hoff came Into his store on Van
Ness avenue and Turk street on Decem
ber 15, about 10 o'clock a. m.; that he re
turned again at noon and stayed there
till shortly after 1 o'clock. He left, saying
that he. was going to work for a nice lady
who had given him a dollar the day be
fore for hanging jome pictures for her.
Hoff came back in the evening about 7
o'clock, read the papers and stepped up
to the bar and said that he had a sore
hand. Bouse looked at the wound, which
was in the palm of his hand and about
an inch long. He recommended to him to
pour some whisky on it. â¢ Hoff was about
to explain how he hurt his hand when
Bouse was called to the front part of the
store to wait on 3ome customers. Hoff
left the store later and went in next door
to the shoemaker's store, Volge's, by the
rear way.
Harry Neemeyer was the clerk of the
IJndell at the time of the crime. He tes
tified that he had known Hoff since 1S34;
that on December 13 a woman, whom he
identified as Mrs. Olute from a photo
graph, called at the house. She left a
card telling Hoff to call Wednesday to do
some work. On December 15 Hoff came
Into the Lindell House on or about 6
o'clock. He was canying his carpet bag
and asked for the key of his room. He
went upstairs, but remained only two or
three minutes. Hoff showed Neemeyer a
wound on his hand, saying that he
scratched It with a nail.
The case went over till Monday morn
ing at 10 o'clock.
Judge Cook broke a finger of his. right
hand by a fall from a streetcar while on
his way to the Hali of Justice. During
the morning session the injury became so
painful that Judgs Cook declared a re
cess and took Dr. Jnman into his cham
bers to set the broken finger.

DISPUTE OVER ESTATE
OF LATE EMMA ABBOTT
pointment of a Conservator
In Lunacy.
CHICAGO. Dec. 7.â An estate of $100,000
left her father by the late Emma Abbott
Is the bone of contention in a contest In
the Probate Court. When Seth Abbott a
few months ago waa brought back to Chi
cago Insane and sent to an asylum, Mary
M. Bartelme was appointed conservator
in lunacy over the estate. It consisted
of the fund of $100,000 In the Farmers'
Loan and Trust Company, producing an
Income of $400 a month for Abbott. A
petition has been filed by D. L. Muddock
of San Diego, Cal.. in which he claims
the right to manage the estate. He sets
forth that he was appointed conservator
of the estate by the Superior Court of
San Diego County. He asserts also that
at the time of his incarceration Abbott
was not a resident of Illinois, but of Cali
fornia, and none of the property lies In
Illlnoi8, but in New York.

Encouraging Reports From

TROOPS ACTIVE
IN PHILIPPINES
WASHINGTON. Dec. 7.â Surgeon Gen
eral Sternberg made public to-day a
report upon the origin and spread of ty
phoid fever in the United States military
camps during the Spanish war of 1898,
prepared at his Instance by a board con
sisting of Major Walter Reed, surgeon,
U. 8. A.; Major Victor V. Vaughn, divi
sion surgeon, U. S.'V., and Major Edward
O. Shakespeare, brigade surgeon, U. S. A.
There were over 20,000 cases of typhoid
fever among the troops encamped within
the limits of the Lnited States from May
until September of that year. It became
epidemic in all camps, large and small,
north and south.
The board found that many commands
during the war were unwisely situated,
that the space allotted to regiments was
in some instances entirely Inadequate, and
many regiments were a-iowed to remain
on one site too long. Requests for changes
in location made by medical officers o:i ac
count of the unfit condition of the camns
in question were not always granted. In
somo instances camps were set up in spite
of earnest protests from medical officers
against the sanitary unfltness of the sites
selected. The camps became very filthy
in general, it la stated, and line officers
are thus held responVble to some extent
for the unsanitary conditions that devel
oped. In this connection the board sug
gests that greater authority be given med
ical officers in questions relating to the
hygiene of camps.
Where water carriage cannot be secured
In permanent ramps it Is suggested that
all fecal matter be disinfected and then
carted away 'from the camp, and the
board has made a special recommendation
that galvanized iron troughs containing
milk of lime be utilized for this purpose.
Infected water was found to be an Im
portant factor in the spread of typhoid in
the encampmentB of 1898. To guard against
the contamination of the water supply,
facilities for the sterilization of water for
troops In the field are recommended.
Flies which swarmed over Infected fecal
matter in the camp pits are believed to
have transmitted typhoid bacillus. K has
been conclusively settled that a company
badly Infected with typhoid cannot rid
itself of the Infection by simply changing
Its location, as It carries with it the spe
cific agents of the disease. Complete dis
infection of men and effects is absolutely
necessary.
Except where urgent necessity makes It
necessary, the board urges that one com
mand should not be located upon a site re
cently occupied and vacated by another.
Malaria was not a prevalent disease
among the camps during the war, al
though many short attacks of typhoid
were generally diagnosed as some form of
malarial fever. Altogether about one-fifth
of the soldiers In the national encamp
ments during the Spanish war developed
typhoid, about half of the cases being cor
rectly diagnosed by the army surgeons.
The death rate was 7.61 per cent, and the
average period of Incubation waa found to
be about ten and one-half days. v: .-.

JOHN S. SILVER IS
AGAIN IN TROUBLE
Charged With Failing to Account for
Money Deposited on
Margins.
NEW YORK. Dec. 7.â John S. Silver,
who claims that he carried on a business
in railway shares and investment securi
ties, was held for the grand jury to-day
ta 11000 bail. The complaint against him,
which charged grand larcveny, was made
by Howard J. Barlow, a former employe
of the Metropolitan Railway Company.
I'arlcw testilied that he had deposited
J.V-t as margin on stock transactions, but
r;ad betn unable to get an accounting
from Silver.
Silver is the man who in connection with
Franci* C. Grable secured $397,000 from the
Chr-mical National Bank a year or so
ago on securities which were afterward
taid to h* worthless. As a result of this
transaction Cashier William J. Quinland
of the Chemical Bank resigned.
this year's effort of the Doctor's Daugh
ters. All the prize winners, the model
dolls, are in one room, mounted on white
tables under dainty arches of green.
There are four rows of them, and they
represent everything from a first prize win
ner in the trimmest of trim riding habits,
mounted upon a piebald porÂ»y. to a bride
in all her finery. There are calling dresses,
street dresses, party dresses, tailor made
gowns, house dresses and evening dresses,
all made with greatest care and all per
fect as to fit.
In an adjoining room are the dolls for
sale, the dolls' house, the dresser, the
dolls" basket and the fish pond. Long be
fore nightfall the big table on which were
the salable dolls began to look rather
thinly populated, for buying was brisk
and Hales were easy. It will be replen
ished, however, so no intending purchaser
need fear being unable to find a doll to
buy.
The doll's house, donated by MJs3 Bruce.
Mrs. Flournoy and Mrs. Ballard, caught
and held the youngsters who were brought
to the show, and there was a continuous
chorus of rapture as succeeding groups
Joined the crowd about it. It is a house
of six rooms, kitchen, bath and hallway.
It has three flights of stairs, a real hat
rack and real hats hanging upon it, and
a youth with a plug hat in the lower hall
who has evidently come to call upon one
of the dolls In the house. There is a real
stove in the kitchen upon .which some cul
inary mysteries are cooking, and there is
a cook working at a kitchen table. Across
the hall is a dining-rcom with the table
laid. Above is a bedroom with a pretty
little dresser, a dainty little bed, a nurse
and a baby. The parlor is done in red,
the living-room in green and the whole is
lighted with tiny electric lights.
The doll's basket, donated by Mrs. Hen
ry J. Crocker, has everything it should
have, which covers a multitude of things,
and the dresser donated by Miss Kate Dil
lon has as much as any baby heart can
desire. The fish pond is a mystery until
a line Is thrown in, and then it becomes
a lottery, with a prize for every player.
To-day will be the last day of the show.
It will open this morning at 10 o'clock, and
at 10 to-night it will close. It is expected
that it will be the children's day, for yes
terday the mothers generally came for a
quiet look unincumbered by youthful
questioners.
Two of the fine dolls have already been
sold, both to Thomas H. Williams. One.
the Hearst doll, he bought for $150. and
the other, the doll dressed and donated
by the City of Paris, he bought for $100.

the day with a ehow of firmness on Liverpool
steadiness in the face of the loss here yester
day, the light Argentine shipments and a cable
announcing that rain was interfering with
harvest work in that cruntry. January wheat
opened V4Â®%c higher at ( 71Â©71%c and sold dur
ing the first ha.}f-hour to 71 lie. The crowd was
inclined to be bearish, however, and the bulge
met liberal selling undtr the theory that con
tinued liberal receipts nnd outside unwilling
ners to buy were not conditions calculated to
custaln prlcc-s. January therefore was prad
uully pressed down clurins the forenoon to
TO^^O^kc. At this point the market was re
inforced by a fresh supply of bullish news.
Holland and Portugal were reported at sword's
points and .the s:aboard, ns well as Minneap
olis, reported a stiffer cash demand. The re
ceipt of this news caused a rally to 71%c and
the close was firm, \ic cveV yesterday at 711ic.
Corn started out strong. This was particu
larly true of December, which felt keenly . the
fact that the receipts, 211 cars, contained no
ccrn of contract grade. The weather was un
favorable for grading future .arrivals, which
was also a i>otent influence. December was ln
good demand early, but was offered freely on
the bulge. The last half of the session -was

ing an Increase of 300.0W bushels there this
week. But the shorts did some buylnz on
the Argentine damage and the trouble be

from the Argentine were an additional factor
of strength. The demand was moderate, but
there was an Improving demand for Flour.

NEW TORK, Dec. 7.â Bradstreet' s Financial
Review to-morrow will say:
During the past week there has been a fur
tl'er slackening of speculative activity at New
Ycrk. The public is no longer buying stocks
with vigor, and while advances have been
scored ln various parts of the railroad bhare
list they seem to be the result of support by
large Interests or manipulation by bull pooU.
The professional element has also continued
to exhibit more or less Inclination to work on
the bear side, although so far as railroad
stocks are concerned the Impression produced
by their attempts to depress prices has been
comparatively small. In the industrials, how
ever, declining tendencies have been more pro
nounced. The Tact that the directors .of the
American Sugar Company Instead of increasing
the dividend on that stock to 2 per cent quar
terly, as was anticipated, kept the rate at lÂ»i
per cent, resulted in a sharp break in that im
portant security, and later on there was a de
cline in Tennessee Coal, which also had an
effect upon the market at large. American
Steel and Wire has been the object of a great
deal of attention on account of the stories
which.- are circulated of dissensions In its man
agement and the announcement that a stock
exchange house has asked for proxies for use
at the coming annual meeting, the purpose
being to effect a change in the management.
Statements that the iron and steel trades,
while in a sound condition, are by no means
coming, have a tendency to create caution,
net only ln regard to industrials, but the rail
road list as well, and offset to a considerable
extent the continuance of good earnings by
nearly all the leading systems. Humors of
deals and combinations are still heard, and
support is given to many different groups of
stocks on this baÂ»!Â». It may also be noted
that while speculative buying is of small pro
portions the investment demand for bonds and
dividend-paying stocks of the best class Is on
a large scale. The scarcity of high-grade bond
Ubues is noteworthy and has led to a marked
demand for securities of what may be termed
the second rank. The January disbursements
for dividends and Interest will undoubtedly be
the largest in the history of the United States,
and the demand for securities ln which to re
invest a considerable portion of the fund thus
released Is being to a certain extent antici
pated and discounted.
NEW YORK, Dec. 7.â The prospect it a de
cline la oa*h resources of the banks of upward
of $7,0W<.w.i proved too much for the fortitude
of speculators to-day and they eold stock*, re
versing the movement of yesterday. Although
they had the advantage ot new points of
6trength in a number of individual stocks
*.mong the low-f.rioed stocks, a. demoralized
tone ln one or two of the industrials, more
than o-set this advantage. The sub-treasury
alone has taken up from the banks during the
week. JS.IOO.GOO. Including the deposits at the j
sub-treasury for telegraphic transfer to the in
terior. The direct movement by express, al
though supposed to 1-e email on balance, is cer
tainly in Javor of the interior. There is a sus
picion also that the local movements of cash,
which have helped out the showing of the
b&skx for the last few weeks is not to be re
lied upon this week. These gair.s have been
due to a large extent to the operations Â«f a
single bar.k, in which is centered Eome of the
tnoÂ« Important interests ln the financial world,
including copper mining stocks. The course
of Amalgamated Copper during the "week has
giver, rife to the apprehension that interests
identified with it need not be expected to have
taken measures to conserve the general money
m&riiet tituation. The loan Item also is the
eubjpct of much perplexed eurmiw. While
there baa been eome speculative liquidation in
U.e stock market there has been some large
btrrowins for outside financial operations, in
cluding the subscriptions to a tlO.Oxj.OOo issue
of Third -avenue railroad bonds, which also
closed the day with the announcenent that it
tie been largely over-subscribed. If there has
been any considerable loan expansion double
ettf-ci on the sur;-Ius reserve may prove Bome
what sensational, especially with the most try
lnp i>erlod of the year on the money market
10 be immediately faced. Liquidation was not
urgest in the stock market, but was quite gen
eral. Even the Erie securities yielded tempo
rarily m the denial of a story attempting to
explain their movement by alleging that the
company had purchased thÂ« Pennsylvania Coal
O*r.iÂ»any. B>th the etocks ani bonds, how
ever, rallied subsequently to top price. Be
tides t!:!s, strength wae eaown by the St. Louis
and San Fr^cisco stocks, led by the second
preferred with an advance of 2V. and the New
York. <TiJfairo and St. Louis, led by the second
preferrpd with an advance of 4^. On the other
band there was continued weakness ln Ten
net-see Coa! en persistent rumens that the divi
dend would be passed. The stock fell at one
time 2\t and after fluctuating feverishly closed
Â¦within i% of the lowest. Pacific Mail broke
nearly 4 points on the large decrease In net
earning? reported for October. The unsatis
factory results of the meeting of Western rail
road president* to enforce the observance of
freljtht rates helped to depress the railroad list.
There v.a* weakness in People's Gae, Tobacco
and the local tractions. The closing was
moderately active and eaey and many stocks
Â¦were at the low r"'ict_
Business ln bonds continued large. There
â¢was profit-talcing ln mom* of the speculative

Failures for the week were 2S7 in the United
States, against 221 last year, and 25 in Canada,
against 25 last year.
Hides are easier, especially for country lines
at Chicago. Even after the decline of the
rast two weeks the average is above the clos
ing prices of October. Wool remains steady
and sales are less than half of last year. Manu
facturers purohase carefully and the goods
mcrket Is unusually dull for the season.
For the first time in many weeks the cereals
exhibited strength and some advance wes to
hi expected after the extensive decline. Wheat
was started upward by the foreign markets
and prompt response here compelled covering
oi contracts. Nothing of importance was
learned regarding domestic conditions, aside
frem the heavy marketing at Interior cities,
ns indicated by Western receipts of 5,823.402
bushels, against 3,902,793 in the previous week.
O11 the other hand exports from the Atlantic
Coast cities were only 2,214,409 bushels, against
3,359,677 in 1S99.

NEW YORK. Dec. 7.-R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade will say to-morrow:
Business - is j progressing . along conservative
lines. It is without excitement and without
great speculative activity, but with a confi
dent undertone, which is to be explained largely
by the fact that leading concerns ln most of
the great industries have orders booked to em
ploy their machinery at nearly full capacity
duilng months when curtailment was usual.
No net reduction in working force has ap
peared inÂ»the last fortnight and a readjust
ment of. wage schedules in some branches of
the steel trade is effected without trouble.
Prices of commodities are generally steady and
holiday trade is brisk at all points. The South
Is particularly cheerful, with cotton and the
rice ciop Coming ln at very full prices.
. There is no cause for alarm in the small
volume of new business at iron and steel cen
ters. With the first sign of higher prices there
came forward such a flood of contracts that
mills and furnaces booked orders sufficient to
keep the full v force employed for months.
Hence there has come a more quiet condition,
with less bidding for products. Fortunately
quotations were not forced up unreasonably
during the week's greatest activity, and now
there is no sign of depression. On the other
hund bars are more firmly held, while many
idle mills have resumed in this department,
and sheetmakers also insist on better terms.
Other forms of finished material are steady
and at most points pig Is unchanged, although
concessions ' are made for Bessemer at Pitts
burg. Numerous bridges are being erected by
the railroads and a heavy tonnage of struc
tural steel is taken. Other railway supplies
are in active demand, with rolling stock ur
gently sought. Business In iron is particu
larly brisk at Chicago. With slight modera
tion ln domestic buying more attention is given
to exports.

NEW TORK, Deo. 7.â The local metal mar
ket ruled generally quiet and without special
new features of importance aside from slight
losses ln tin and spelter. The weakness ln tin
was partly the result of heavy shipments from
London. Outside markets closed dull and weak
at $27 25.' Tin in London, though final prices
indicated a net gain of Â£1, was at one time
7e 6d below the figures of the previous day. The
close was firm at Â£120 6s. Lake Copper ruled
dull and nominally unchanged at S10 for Lake
Superior and J16 62% for casting copper, despite
easier advices from abroad, the market closing
in London at Â£73 2s 6d, a loss of 6s.
Lead, while very dull locally, was weak and
2s 6d lower in London, prices reaching the low
est mark since February 1. The close here was
dull at $4 37H- Spelter was unchanged abroad
but exhibited an easier feeling here on liberal
receipts, and closed easy at $4 22%@4 27&. The
domestic iron markets remained quiet and nom
inally unchanged, while ln London exceptional
activity prevailed. Foundry northern, $15@

The Chinaman was so much disturbed
over the discovery of the body In the box
that he declined to allow it even to be
stored next to his room, and President
Wheeler had to keep it in his library over
night.
The box was long and narrow and tight

hammer and oh!s=el to remove the top. and
then the Chinaman found generous quan

some felt packing.

A DAMAGE VERDICT
Eecovers Twelve Hundred Dollars
Walter Thompson Kellogg recovered
Judgment yesterday afternoon in the
United States Circuit Court against the
Southern Pacific Company for $1200 for
the loss of his father, George S. Kellogg,
In a railroad accident on October 16, 1898.
George S. Kellogg was a railway mall
clerk and was killed by the telescoping
of two cars when the engine was derailed
by running upon a sand drift in the des
ert between Yuma and Glamls.
Young Kellogg, who is now 18 years old,
sued the railroad company for $10,000
damages for the death of his father, and
alleged that the accident was due to the
negligence of the railroad officials. The
case was tried -before Judge Morrow and
a Jury last August and the Jury dls
agreed.
defense was that the father of the
plaintiff was a dissipated man, and had
deserted his boy years before the acci
dent and had not contributed one cent
toward his support. It was thereforefar
gxied by the attorneys for the railroad
company that the value of the father so
far as the son was concerned was noth
ing.

E. O. McCormiek. passenger traffic
manager of the Southern Pacific, returned
yesterday afternoon from St. Louis and
Chicago, where he attended meetings of
the Transcontinental Passenger Associa
tion. A matter of considerable interest
to Callfornlans which came up at both
meetings was the fixing of a ppecial
transportation rate for,delegates who will
attend the Epworth League convention,
to be held in this city in July of next
year, x rom 25,000 to 30,000 visitors, from
all parts of the United States, are expect
ed, and special trains to the coast will ba
run from every large city In the East.
It was practically agreed that a round
trip fare of $50 rhould be offered from
Chicago to this city, and the holder will I
have the benefit of a generous number of
stop-over privileges. Mr. McCormick says
that the railroads are .planning to carry
as many. If not more, delegates as were
handled during the Christian Endeavor
convention here three years ago.
Another important matter taken up oy

nists' rates, which will go Into effect Feb
ruary 12. 19 and 26; March 6, 12, 19 and 26,
and April 2, 9. 11. 23 and 30.
"The idea of having colonists' rates,"
said Mr. McCormick. "in to attract vis
itors to the Westâ men who have small
sums to Invest in real estate and who
would have come out here long ago if
transportation had been within their
reach. Exceptionally low rates will be ot
fered. From Chicago the fare will be
$30; from St. Louis, $27 50; from points
west of the Missouri River 525, and from
Memphis, $27 50."
The matter of transportation of corpses
In baggage-cars was discussed and finally
laid over until the January meeting. The
railroads are anxious to discontinue car
rying corpses, the plan being to turn the
business over to the express companies.

TACOMA. Dec. 7.â The first mate, fire
men and coal passers of the steamship
Centennial to-day libeled the steamship
Santa Ana of Ran Francisco, claiming as
their share one-third of the salvage due
the Centennial for towlner the Santa Ana
from Nome to Seattle. The vessels were
chartered to the Northwest Commercial
Company, with the result that- the Cen
tennial made no claim for damage. The
mate, firemen and coal passers, forming
one-third of the Centennial's crew, claim
that the services rendered by the Centen
nial clearly entitle her to salvage, and ac
cordingly demand their share. The Santa
Ana was towed south by the Centennial
because she had broken several propeller
blades, rendering her partially helpless.
She is valued at $130,000 and her cargo at
$20,000. The Santa Ana was libeled at the
Tacoma drydock, where she is being re
paired.

"Most peop!'* treat the outgoing of the

< omes to my mind is that most people
have a fixed i<!ea that as the world grows
older it becomes more liberal. There are
others who think that the world Is becom

'We see every day young men who turn
tb<*ir barks to religion, but really the
world is more religious now than it was
Â¦ in the last century- I think that the world
is boiler now than it Â¦was thirty years
ago. At the opening of this century there
was a feeling of unrest, there was .a social
upheaval, poverty was rampant. In
Â¦France there was a big revolution. When
an Emperor's throne is shaking the Pope's
tiara does not Fit steady on his head. Re
ligion at that time had received a big
shaking up: the world was beginning to

Â¦were h.eld fn contempt. The French people
:ea!ly thought that God was dethroned
and that 'reason' would rule the world.
Society at that time was divided into two
''istir.ct classes, the dogmatist and the
â¢ Â¦rposite. Therefore It was quite natural
:hat in the two classes there were the be

â¢rue to the faith of its fathers. Friction

iÂ»m bold to pay that there seems to be less
enmity between the different religious de
nominations now and more efforts for
harmony."
Before the Congregation Sherith Israel
the Rev. Dr. Jacob Nieto delivered an
r.loquent sermon in which he discussed
Richard Wsjrner as a religionist. The
reverend gentleman analysed the music
of the great composer as an inspiration,
as an exposition of religious, exalted feel

The Incident in the wardroom of the
Marlon, in which It was charged Morri
son used insulting language, was ex
plained by Morrison with the statement
that he had a right to object to the pres
ence of all the guests in the wardroom,
but. that probably he had expressed his
objections in more forcible language than
he should have used.
The Investigation will go on again Mon
day.
It was shown by the testimony of W.
G. Morrison, lieutenant commanding the
First Division, that the order calling the
muster was dated for one day and an
other date so it was Impossible to tell
whether the muster was to be held on
Tuesday, November 20, or Wednesday.
November 21. The order called for Tues
day, November 2L It was shown, too,
by the testimony of Major Hewes, the
Inspecting officer, that there were no
property rolls ready, no muster rolls
made up nor was the propcrtv of the
division in any condition to be inspected.
The night of Wednesday, November 21.
for which the muster had been ordered
by General Dickinson, there were but ten
men and two officers of the division pres
ent. It was shown that when the officers
of the division were told to line up their
men they lined fourteen,* and two of
these were members of the other division
and two more were not members of the
naval militia at all.
Regarding the parade report for Sep
tember 10. it was shown that Morrison
reported thirty-seven men present when
he had not sufficient men to man a platoon
that required at most thirty-six men, and
that ten men from other organizations in
the parade were detailed to him to make
up the necessary complement for his
platoon.
Matters became irore Interesting at the
inquiry into the affairs of tho Naval Mili
tia la*t evening, the testimony turning
upon the muster of the First Division last
month and the parade reports for the
10th of September parade.

According to the answer filed by Ed
ward R. Perrin to-day "to the suit his
wife, Sarah Perrin. has brought against
him for desertion the usual obligations of
man and woman in the matter of court
ship and marriage were quite Reversed.
To cap the climax Perrin winds up his
story of abuse by asserting that he is
without funds whatever, and asking that
the court make an order directing his
wife to pay him alimony at the rate of
$50 a month.
Perrin asserts that he met Sarah John
son, or. rather, she met him, in 1S09, when
he was conducting a little store In Ala
meda. Though she was 70 years old and
he 74 years, she took a fancy to him
right away. After a short wooing on her
part she demanded that he marry her.
Perrin said he was content to live on his
pension and his little store. Sarah John
son said that there was enough for two,
and that they would live In tranquillity
at San Leandro. her home. .There was a
promise that there were to be no more
boarders kept by the bride-to-be. Perrin
consented to marry after all these prom
ises were made.
But. Perrin allpRPs. his wife began to
abuse him a few days after the wedding,
which took place in October, 1S99. She
made him work at menial labor from
morning until night, anil then nearly
starved him by giving him food that was
not fit to eat. He winds up his statement
with the assertion that, "fearing his mar
riage misery would hasten him to hl3
grave, he quit plaintiff in disgust one
month Â«jftÂ«>r the wadding."

The adoption or rejection of these
amendments will have a great effect upon
the coming city campaign. If the amend
ments carry it will center the fight upon
the one office of Mayor, because he will
have the appointment of the new Board
of Public Works and Police and Fire
Commissioners, which are made separate
organizations. The entire patronage of
the city will be dispensed by those
boards. If the amendments do net carry
it means that there will be hard fights
for the offices of Mayor. City Engineer
and City Attorney next spring, for they
are -the distributors of the patronage
under the present system.
Municipal candidates are not announc
ing themselves now. and will not do so
until after the election to-morrow, for
that event may change the entire com
plexion of affairs.
THE DAY'S DEAD.
There have been a' number of meetings
that were held for the purpose of explain
ing the amendments, but they have not
been largely attended, and have simply
served to give vent to some personal
opinions upon Oakland politics.
The vote to-morrow is not expected to
be large, and as it requires a three-fifths
majority there is some question as to
whether the amendments will carry.
Each side thinks it will win. but owing
to the lack of interest the result is very
uncertain.
On the other hand that faction In the
city government headed by Frank K.
Mott and Anston Barstow is supporting
the amendments.
It was thought at first that there would
be little opposition to the amendments,
but within the last few weeks very de
cided opposition has developed. The ele
ment in the municipal government repre
sented by Councilmen Taylor, Rowe and
Stetson.' City Attorney Dow and their
following is now openly against the
amendments, particularly those reor
ganizing the Board of Public "Works and
the Police and Fire Cornmlssien. The
Enquirer, which is the organ of that fac
tion, has announced editorial opposition
to the amendments.
The special election for the adoption or
rejection of amendments to the Oakland
charter will be held to-morrow through
out the city. There are eight amend
ments which the people will be asked to
pass upon, four of which deal with, the
reorganization of the. Beard of Public
Works, Police and Fire Commissioners,
and changing the duties of the City At
torney and City Engineer.

COMMERCIAL NEWS
' A month ago fire broke out In the Belt
shaft, one of the Anaconda Company's
properties, and so far all attempts to ex
tinguish it have proved unavailing. A
force of men vras put to work to-day in
the air shaft. SOO feet deep, with the in
tention of drifting to head off the fire In
the main shaft. At noon the men failed
to come to the surface, and a second gans
was sent down to investigate. The second
party also failed to return, and a third
shift was sent below. Many of the third
shift were bvercome by sulphurous gasÂ»s
b.efore a .fourth party protected with
smoke helmets reached the spot. The un
conscious men were passed up ladders one
at a time with great difficulty until all
were taken to the surface. It is not be
lieved that any of the victims will sustain
permanent injury.
BUTTE, Mont., Dec. 7.â What came very
nearly being the largest mining disaster
In the history of the Butte camp occurred
to-day. Fortunately no lives were lost,
but twenty-one unconscious and half-suf
focated miners were hauled to the surface
by ropes from the Bell mine and laid in
rows while nearly all the. doctors in the
city worked over them and by means of
artificial respiration and strong stimu
lants finally succeeded In reviving all the
victims. . ':;;-i-:-:- J . Â¦ â¢ â¢

Goes Ashore in a Fog and Will Probably Go to
Pieces, but the Crew Is Reported Saved.

Unfortunate Vessel Left Here for Eureka Wednes
day, but Captain Miller Lost His Bearings.
â . â , * : ; : : : *
THE steam schooner Cleone, owned
in San Francisco, is supposed to
be a total loss near Point Gorda.
She left here on December 5 for
Eureka and probably went on the
rocks during a fog. Captain Miller knew
the coast well and the owners of the ves
sel were greatly surprised when the news
of the disaster reached the city yesterday.
Point Gorda is ten miles from Cape
Mendocino and about forty miles from the
entrance to Humboldt Bay. During the
dense weather that has prevailed along
tne coast Captain Miller must have over
run his reckoning and piled up on the
rocks. The chances for saving the vessel
are Bald to be very slim. Â¦ â¢
The Cleone was built here in 1887. She
is 119 feet long, 31 feet 2 indies beam and
9 feet 5 inches deep. A. W. Beadle Is her
managing owner, but he has little hope
that she will be saved. The stout little
craft lies in the cove where the old Eu
reka pounded herself to death, where the
British steamer Bawnmore went to
pieces where the old Orizaba weut
asnore and drowned many of her passen
gers. When an investigation is held tlio
flrst question asked captain and officers
will be "Did you use the lead?" If the
lead was not used it will go hard with 'the
master and mate.
PANAMA RAILROAD GETS
Â¦ THE STEAMSHIP ROANOKE
Will Make the First Run January
8th, Following the St.
Paul. '
E. F. Connor, local representative
of the Panama Railroad, received
word from New Tork- yesterday
that the steamship Roanoake had
been chartered by the company and
would make her first run to Panama
on 'January 8. This is the boat upon
which the company secured an option
some weeks ago. The St. Paul had al
ready been chartered. It is understood
the company has options on two other
good vessels, the names of which will be
announced in a few days.
With these four vessels the Panama
people expect to be able to compete with
the Pacific Mail. The business relations
between the two companies end Decem
ber IS. It is not the purpose of the Pan
ama company to cut rates, as it will have
all the business it can handle with the
four steamers.
The Roanoke has been engaged during
the past year in Nome trade, and is at the
present time In Seattle. She will be or
dered to this port immediately. The ves
sel is owned by Chicago parties, and is
similar to the St. Paul in respect to 6peed
and passenger and freight accommoda
tions. The St. Paul makes its initial run
to Panama December 18.
The last Pacific Mail steamer for Pan.
ama sails to-day. The City of Sydney
leaves for all Central American ports and
will make her last point of 'call Panama.
Thereafter all the Mail Company's steam
ships will drop Panama from the sched
ule and will Ignore the Panama Railroad.
OFF FOB A YEAR'S CRUISE.
Crew of the Alice Knowles Will Spend
Christmas at Sea,
The whaling bark Alice Knowles, one
of the last of the old blubber hunting
wind jammers, sails to-night for the
Southern Seas and from there to the coast
of Siberia in quest of the sperm whale. In
the old days the sperm whale was the
mammal most in demand, but now every
body is chasing the right whale for whale
bone and the hunt for sperm oil is left
to perhaps half a dozen vessels. The
last to leave of the fleet that will do the
summer hunting In the Okhotsk Sea is
the Alice Knowles. Several months will
be spent around Hawaii and Guam and
when spring comes a .course will be
steered for the Japanese coast. The crew
of the -vessel were not very much in favor
of such an- early start. They wanted to
have Christmas ashore, but then a liberal
supply of good things' have. been laid in
and all hands and the cook will have a
good time.
Claims Olga and Cargo.
The Societa In Azionl Ungaro-Croata
Per la Xavigazione Liber a of Flume in
Austria-Hungary - filed an Intervention
yesterday in the libel of the J. D. Spreck
els & Brothers Company and the Ship

pany against the steamship Olga and her
freight. The intervened claim the vessel
and cargo as their property. The Olga
and her cargo of sugar are now in the
hands of the United States Marshal.
The Olga goes to the Union Iron "Works
to-morrow. It is expected that the re
pairs to her will cost $85,000. The propeller
has to be removed and the tail shaft
drawn in. Then the stern frame will have
to be replaced and sixty-eight plates
taken from the bottom and new ones sub
stituted. All the rivets have shaken loose
and new ones have to be put in. The ves
sel will be from thirty-five days to six
Â¦weeks on the drydock. All the repairs
will be made under the supervision of

The new management is impressed with
the belief that the company will gain
business, gain popularity and save money
by getting out of' politics. No doubt the
political strikers who are on the com
pany's payroll at present, and others who
expect to get there, will set up a roar of
protest and threaten all sorts of direful
calamities In the linfe of hostile legislation
if their boasted protection , of the co'm-'
pany's- interests is not recognized, but
such threats should not alarm the new
management. The Legislature and courts
of California can be trusted to accord to
railroad property â¢ the same measure j of
protection that is given to other kinds of
property.
Strict adherence to the new policy of
non-interference in politics will ' bring
about a Â¦ reduction in the payroll of the
corporation. It is true that several con
spicuous workers for the company are
State officers who draw compensation
from the State treasury, but In return the
company carries for them a lot of dead
wood that could .be thrown overboard
without hindrance to the legitimate busi
ness of railroading. The expense of sub
sidizing newspapers, maintaining a lobby
at the Legislature and . carrying free on
all trains a gang of political strikers
could be cut off. The saving which could
be readily effected would more than offset
the Increased taxes resulting from fair as
sessment of railroad ' property by the
State Board of Equalization.
No doubt the new policy of the company
was foreshadowed before the recent gen
eral election. It is known that W. F.
Herrin'a contribution to the Republican
State campaign did not exceed $500. and
there is no ground for suspecting that a
larger sum was directly contributed to the
Democratic campaign fund. A large sum,
however, was used In efforts to defeat
Charles M. Belshaw, the Republican nom
inee for State Senator - to represent the
counties of Marln and Contra Costa.
"The Southern Pacific Is out ot politics
and will, stay out. The road shall here
after be "tonducted on purely business
lines. The new president. Mr. Hays,, is
in thorough" accord with this idea. I see
the San Francisco papers speak highly of
his attainments as a railroad man. 1 am
glad the newspapers know of his worth.
He will convince the people of California
that he Is all right. He will give his time
and attention to the business of man
aging the road, leaving affairs political to
the keeping of the politicians."
Mr. Speyer gave special emphasis to the
declaration that the new management
had firmly resolved to adhere to the line
of railroad business pure and simple, and,
above all things, to keep clear of political
entanglements.
It is called to mind by leading politi
cians that C. P. Huntington, after mass-
Ing his forces and dethroning Leland
Stanford from the presidency of the cor
poration, declared publicly that the com
pany was out of politics, and would keep
out, provided the management was not
compelled to re-enter the Held in order to
protect its property.
Mr., Huntington did Institute a tem
porary change for the better. The pay
roll of the- company was revised and
many lawyers, lobbyists, writers and
rounders 1 who had been receiving annual
compensation ! from the treasury of the
road were dismissed. When they got their
walking papers they began to -concoct
schemes for re-establishing themselves
in the favor of the management. They
clearly perceived that danger of hostile
legislation would alarm the company and
suggest the employment of men to -de
feat all measures formed for "cinching"
the road. Whether the danger was real
or imaginary Is yet an open question.
The truth ia, however, thai Mr. Hunt
ington authorized the law department to
create or recreate a political bureau. The
result, so far - Â«is It affected the company,
was unprofitable and unfortunate. The
chief of the law department did not pos
sess either the. skill or ability of his pre
decessor. His methods of manipulation
weie clumsy t-nd amateurish. He expend
ed just enough money to arouse the greed
of the underlings and not sulflclent to at
tain the purpose In view. In political
management affairs went from bad to
worse, until the company was deeper in
the political mire during the Huntington
epoch than it ever was during the reign
of Stanford. Beyond securing control of
the State Board of Equalization and. Rail
road Commission but little of practical
use was secured to the corporation. In
gaining these advantages a spirit of re
sentment was aroused which culminated
in a storm of public remonstrance, when
the railroad sought to control the election
cf a United States Senator to succeed
Stephen M. White.
James Speyer, who is recognized as a
leading spirit of the new Southern Pacific
management, is familiar with affairs
which concern the company in California.
A few days ago he said to one cf the
former owners of the road: ;
The new owners of the Southern Pacific
frankly and positively assert that hence
forth the company will not meddle In
politics. Â¦ There are many good reasons
for believing that the policy of non-inter
ference in the political affairs of Califor
nia will be faithfully observed.

C. M. Hays Will Adhere to

PURE BUSINESS,
NOT POLITICS,
IS THE DECREE
Notorious Card Sharp Makes a Clean-
Up and Escapes, While His Con
federates Are Made to
"Billy" Hurt, the notorious card sharp
and gambler, has been at his tricks again
and two young men of Suisun are mourn
ing an experience In which they were
taught a v.orld of experience at an ex
pense of several thousand dollars. Hurt
is one of the most widely known dis
honest card operators in the country.
Smooth, insinuating, suave, well groomed
and gentlemanly, he has found it easy to
ingratiate himself Into the confidence of
people and then rob them at cards. But
he was until very recently inactive.
A few daye ago a quiet spoken, gentle
manly fellow, slightly lame, made his ap
pearance in Suisun. He spent much time
in the town, making his headquarters
generally at the Oriole saloon. He said
he was In search of a" good investment in
land and was not adverse to listening "to
the advice of any one who cared to give
It to him. He wanted to buy property
and friends had directed him to Suisun. A
nay or so after his arrival anothei
stranger appeared in the town. He balled
irom somewhere in Nevada and appeared
not to know the land seeker. Acquaint
ances are quickly made in a strange
country town, however, and the two
strangers were naturally thrown much
togetner.
one day when time was dragging a lit
tle game of poker was proposed and the
l&me man was asked to take a hand. He
was not anxious to do so, but rinaliy con-
M-ntÂ«?d and the game began. The lume
man played wretchedly. Two young men,
Lou Pierce, who recently fell heir :o a
fortune, and Frank Gurnett. stood watch
ing the game with considerable amuse
ment. Tney conceived the oriliiant laea
that it would be a good joke to get the
lame man into another game and win
some of that money which he intended to
invest in land.
So they perfected their scheme and the
next day they were In town and Invited
the lame man to a game of poker. He
consented with the same reluctance that
be had shown before. Just as the play
ers were getting ready the stranger ftom
Xevada happened to drop in. He was
as-ked to take a hand, but declared that
he never gambled lor large sums. He
was laughingly told that ne would not
have to and he joined the game. When
the game closed the lame man who
vanted to buy a ranch and the stranger
from Nevada had $2000 which had been
in Pierce's pockets and several hundred
dollars which had belonged to Gurnett.
For novices the strangers had displayed
a most remarkable ability at the great
game.
A few days later a man from Napa was
listening at the merchandise store of
"King" Perkins to the story of the won
derful poker game. The lame man wa=
described. The man from Napa grinned.
"He is Billy Hurt," he said, "tho
shrewdest, crookedest card player in the
country."
"*Th"n there was a row. The two wise
young men plotted revenge. They deter
mined to try conclusions once more with
Hurt and his confederate from " Nevada
and beat them at their own game.
Pierce and Gurnett secured several
thousand dollars and went looking for the
card sharps. Those worthies were in the
saloon and perhaps did not know that
their victims had armed themselves and
had brought along a crowd of sturdy
young fellows to help along the play.
Hurt was overjoyed to see his new-made
friends. He bought drinks for everybody
and then bought again. He was all in a
bustle and kept treating as fast as the
crowd could drink. Then he excused him
self for a moment and they are looking
for him yet.
The man from Nevada was not so for
tunate. The crowd made him disgorge,
but all he had was tliX) and a gold, dia
mond studded medal, awarded for valor
by President Van Buren and worth prob
aL.y $500. Pierce has the medal and told
the man from Nevada that $500 can re
deem it. The pledge is not likely, how
ever, to be redeemed, and the whole town
is telling the story of the two wise young
men of Suisun.

Suisun Pay Heavily
for Experience.
