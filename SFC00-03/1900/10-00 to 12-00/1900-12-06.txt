Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA CRUZ,! Dec 6â One of the
greatest legal sensations in the
State was sprung to-day upon the
people of this city when a motion
In this way, Grover asserts. the_bank
obtained control of the corporation of
Grover & Co., appointing J. H. Logan, H.
13. Makinney, J. G. Tanner and J. F.'
Forgues majority directors. Logan Is an
ex-Superior Judge 'of- Santa Cruz County
and one of the most prominent and.repu-^
Accuses Logan of Being a Tool.
In this part of his complaint L. F. Gro
ver makes perhaps his most serious alle
gation. He -declares that the Bank of
Santa Cruz County accepted from D. W.
Grover and Hannah F. Grover 1100 shares
of the stock of Grover & Co. in satisfac
tion of an indebtedness of $40,000. Grover
charges that' when the bank officials, of
whom ex-Lieutenant Governor Jeter is
president, accepted this stock In satisfac
tion of an indebtedness of $40,000 they ac
cepted what they knew to be the worth
less stock of an Insolvent corporation.
In this complaint Grover was particu
lar to characterize the Individual defend
ants. He alluded to the fact that H. E.
Makinney is the legal partner of William'
T. Jeter, and alleged that Makinney had
acted not only for the bank but for Gro
ver & Co., and had been paid for both
services out of the property which should
have been credited to Grover & Co. In the
Bank of Santa Cruz . County. Grover
charged further that J. F. Forgues, a real
estate dealer, another. of the men who
wa3 one of Jhe defendants, was a tool of
Jeter, and was made by him one of the
directors of Grover & Co. In 1 order that
the bank of Santa Cruz County, through

Final Adjustment Will Probably Yield
Five Million Dollars or More
to the Stanford
University.
Steps for disposing of the stocks, bonds,
franchises, townsltes, real estate, hotels,
coal mines, railroads and other proper
ties of the Pacific Improvement Company
will be pradually taken. The affairs of
the corporation will bo closed up by a
process of liquidation.
Leland Stanford, Charles Crocker, C. P.
Huntlngton and Mark Hopkins each
owned one-fourth, or twenty-five thou
sand shares of the company's stock, and
the ownership) now resides in the estates
of the founders of the corporation The
organization was first known as ' the
Western Development Company. Later
on the name was changed to that of Con
tract and Finance Company. Late in
the "seventies" a readjustment took place
and the name Pacific Improvement Com
pany was given to the institution.
The Speyers in their recent purchase of
the Crocker. Searles and Stanford hold
ings of Central and Southern Pacific
stock did not acquire any interest in the
Paciflo Improvement Company.
The value of the property belonging to
the Pacific Improvement Company is not
known and can hardly bo approximately
estimated. In fact an estimate must be
in the nature of a conjecture. A prolonged
era of general prosperity may add largely
to the value of some of the properties and
Invite purchasers to offer sums far be
yond present expectation. It is taken into
account also that events may occur that
will cause a depression, but nothing is
likely to occur that will compel the pres
ent owners to sell at a sacrifice. They
can afford to wait until the property can
be sold for what It is worth. ,
An estimate of $20,000,000 as the value of
the property of the company may not be
wide of the true mark, but It would not
be surprising if the sum of $30 ; 000,000 was
realized. The Stanford University will be
enriched by whatever sum is derived from
Mre. Stanford's one-fourth Interest.
There was a meeting of the stockholders
of the company In this city day before
yesterday. The Crocker and Stanford in
terests were represented. H. E. Hunting
ton would have attended if pressing busi
ness affairs in another field had not called
him East before the meeting took place.
Tho representatives of the company in
New York were communicated with by
wire. There was ample exchange of views
regarding future policy. No division of
sentiment was created. All the parties
in Interest acquiesced in the suggestion
that a course of gradual liquidation be
pursued. There aro no premonitions of
Internal strife. , Indications arc that the
affairs of the institution will be finally ad-
Justed and closed up without factional
quarrels or resort to hostile litigation.
All parties concerned agreed that it
would not be prudent or profitable to re
store the tavern at Castle Crag which
was recently destroyed by fire. The South
ern Pacific Company can do as it pleases
in regard to the building of a new hotel,
but the "P. I." Company is not going to
take on any further responsibilities in the
hotel line. â¢
CONVICTS ESCAPE FROM

NEW YORK, Dec. 5.â A World special
from Hongkong says: Eight - desperate
convicts who were being taken from Ma
nila to San Francisco escaped last rilght
from the United States army transport
Grant, which touched here to get the
body of Paymaster Barber and' convey it
home to America. The convicts were
destined to prisons in the United States.
They got loose somehow, snatched . life
belts and Jumped Into the sea. After
floating about for awhile they were picked
up by a steam launch and brought to this
city.
Among them was a soldier who had de
serted from the American army and had
joined the Insurgent Filipinos, but had
been captured. ?
Three of the party have been found and
taken back aboard the transport Grant
In irons.
FTJNSTON'S MEN ABE
FIGHTING INSURGENTS
MANILA, Dec. 5.â A dispatch has been
received from General Funston giving an
account of a two hours' fight In the
woods of Santo Domingo between an
American force and 300 rebels commanded
by Sadlco. The American force, consist-
Ing of thirty native scouts; commanded
by Lieutenant Jolnlgan, attacked . the
rebels, who retreated, 'leaving on the field
sixteen killed, Including the rebel leader
Aguilar and an American negro. It was
at first thought the latter was r a man
named Fagin, a deserter from the
Twenty-fourth Infantry, . but this turned
out to be a mistake. Not one of Joinl
gan's men was wounded.
NEW YORK,, Dec. 5.â A special to the
Journal from St. Petersburg says: The
Russian forces In Manchuria have discov
ered a hitherto unknown republic called
Chapigou, In the upper valley of the
river Sungary. It has existed nearly a
hundred years, and was first ruled by
three chosen elders, but now one chosen
man Is, its ruler. Chapigou has courts, a
system of taxes. Industries and an army,
all quite European. Its population Is 10,000.
In diplomatic circles hero. the agree
ment reached Is regarded as the result of
the keen diplomacy of Secretary Hay, and
he Is given the highest praise' for his
work. Other powers are expected to In
struct their representatives to sign the
agreement, which will then be handed to
the Chinese envoys. Negotiations regard-
Ing details will promptly follow. It will
be within the power of the allied nations
even after acceptance of the demands by
the Chinese to Insist upon t more severe
punishment than she administers In case
it should be found that she is not inflict
ing punishments as severe as ahe can
safely do.
DISCOVERY OF A REPUBLIC.
These demands were very unsatisfactory
to the Washington authorities. Fortunate
ly at this moment Japan indicated that
she favored moderation. Backed by
Japan, Russia and France, the President
and Secretary Hay seized the opportunity
to bring about an exchange of views
among the powers. Russia suggested that
the demand regarding punishment should
call for the severest punishment short of
death that China, could inflict; and with
a slight modification this was adopted.
Great Britain fell Into line and finally
Germany's assent was obtained.
Germany insisted from the outset of the
trouble that the execution of the Boxer
leaders would only salve her wounded
honor, and the Anglo-German agreement
caused Great Britain to support the same
view. As a result of the vindictlveness
cf Germany and of the Ministers who had
undergone the siege, terms were drafted
requiring the execution of the authors of
outrages and the payment of an indemnity
to great that It was plain it could never
be cpllected.
The terms as finally formulated still in
clude several features not entirely wel
come to the American Government, as,
for instance, demands for the razing of
the Taku forts. Interdiction of importa
tion of arms and the establishment of
permanent guards between Peking and
the sea. Yet the questions of punishment
and indemnity are really the vital ones.
As finally adopted by the Ministers, the
demands upon China are that she shall
impose the severest possible punishment
the Chinese Government can Inflict and
pay a reasonable indemnity to the powers
for the killing of their citizens, damage
to their property and expenses Incurred
in the dispatch of relief expeditions.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W. t WASHINGTON. Dec. 5.â American
diplomacy has averted prolonged strife
over China, and, barring accidents, has
insured the Integrity of the empire
through the adoption by the Ministers at
Peking yesterday of the amended de
mands as to punishment and Indemnity,
which it was known the Chinese Govern
ment would accept. Upon receipt of the
news of this satisfactory- conclusion of
the negotiations. Secretary Hay cabled
Minister Conger instructions to sign the
agreement. In the opinion of officials and
diplomats here, this result marks the
most Important step yet taken toward a
peaceful solution. The information which
reached here conveyed the idea that If
the powers had approved the original de
mands of the Ministers, contemplating the
execution of eleven officials and Princes
and an exorbitant indemnity. LI Hung
Chang and Prince Ching would immedi
ately have rejected them. In view of the
moderation In the amended demands, it
is. .known that they will be accepted by
not only the Chinese envoys, but also the
throne.

DIPLOMACY
TRIUMPHS
Rev. Mr. Wohl was recognized as one
of the most forceful and eloquent * of
Presbyterian ministers of this State. Mr.
Stokes is an ex-Virginia university presi
dent and comes from one of the best fam
ilies of the Old Dominion.
Up to a late hour this evening Mr.
Stokes has refused to say anything con
ffrning the terrible tragedy, and Mrs.
Irvine is in too much of a state of exclie-
Diest to talk.
In the hall of the minister's home, fac
ir.s; the fearful duel to the death, fallen
across thÂ» doorway, was found Mrs.
Lerloe. It was first thought ehe was
<>.id and probably had been shot, but an
investigation showed that 6he had only
fainted from fripht.
Stokes was picked up by friends at
tracted by the sound of the shooting and
taken to a doctor's office, where his
v.-ound was dressed. He was then sur
rendered to the officers and immediately
released on bail. He alleges self-defense.
Suddenly, with the exclamation "You
are a liar." Wohl, showing a derringer,
rushed upon Stokes, who backed slowly
sway. Wohl kept advancing and when
v ithln a few paces Cred, the bullet pierc
ing Stokes' side. He reeled and fell, but
as he did so he drew a revolver. At this
ir.Ftar.t Wohl again fired, and almost at
the same time Stokes returned the flre.
the bullet striking Wohl in the forehead,
causing instant death.
This afternoon Stokes, while talking to
a friend in front of the house in which
WoU lived, was ordered by him to leave.
Stokes refused to comply with the demand
and a fierce wordy dispute ensued, Wohl
etar.dlng on his porch and Stokes on the
gldewalk.

IS KILLED
IN A DUEL
Jn this suit L. F. Grover alleged that
none of the four directors whom he has
made defendants was a bona fide owner
of stock ln'the company. Grover declares
that these men had the stock simply In
their names, and I that it was the prop
erty of the defendant banks. .He declares
that all of the directors were simply crea
tures of the banksâ dummies employed by
William T. Jeter to carry out the unfair,
unjust, 2 Iniquitous * schemes of the .banks
and to, ruin f Grover. & Co. and secure: its
property.
Says Directors Were Dummies.
Tho standing of the Bank of Santa Cruz
County and of the Santa Cruz Bank of
Savings and Loan, and the prominence of
the men who have been made defendants,
make the case one of exceptional interest.
Much testimony has been taken and the
very supplemental complaint* which was
presented to-day Is alleged to be based
upon testimony which is already said to
have been introduced into the case. Early
in the year I* F. Grover, a son of the"
principal owner of the corporation of
Grover & Co., instituted a suit against
both banks and the directors of the cor
poration of Grover & Co., which was one
of the most influential lumber firms in the
State. . -, .'. . ' Â¦
Serious as are these allegations, they
are not all in the remarkable Indictment
which is now exciting the people of this
city. As president of the bank ex-Lleu
tenant Governor Jeter Is accused of hav
ing released ; indebtedness to the bank
amounting to $40,000 for 1100 shares ; of
worthless stock in an insolvent corpora
tion. He is charged with having com
pelled his legal partner,, H.E. Maklnney,
to become a director of Grover & Co. and
to accept fees from ; the Bank of Santa
Cruz County to prosecute a suit against
the alleged insolvent corporation. This
suit has dragged a reasonably long course
without exciting^ suspicion until to-day,
when the remarkable supplemental com
plaint was placed before the court and
the serious nature pf the charges became
known. Â« â¢. . V.'

his partner was a director. Ex-Lleuten
ant Governor Jeter is charged, as presi
dent of the bank, with having, without or
der, authority or proper chock, compelled
Grover & Co. to pay the expenses of the
suits Instituted against themselves.
table attorneys here, yet in this, complaint
he is accused of having acted as the sub
servient tool of ex-Lieutenant Governor
Jeter;. of having permitted the funds of
which he was treasurer to be fraudulently
expended in, the interest of tho two de
fendant banks, and of having signed him
self as president of Grover. & Co. In order
to -carry out the alleged schemes of 'the
bank.* .
Having, thus attempted to establish an
Intimate connection between the defendant
banks and the various Individuals, whom
he accuses with Grover & Co., the plain
tiff makes a Beries of the most serious al
legations reflecting upon the Integrity and
the character of every man ) involved, j
Grover in his complaint declares that the
Bank of Santa Cruz County and the Santa .
Cruz Bank of Savings and Loan, through
the agency of William T. Jeter, forced
Grover & Co. to lease Its mills and its mill
sites to other people, the alleged â¢ dummy
directors doing as Jeter commanded them.
Grover alleges that the banks forced the
directors of the company to pass whatever
resolutions these banks j commanded, and
through these resolutions to lease, sell,
transfer, mortgage and otherwise dispose
of the company's property for the sole
benefit of the banks, which by their al
leged bad . investments had - placed them
selves In Jeopardy. As a result of these
operations by tho alleged' dummy direct
ors, Grover aserts that the banks have
now In their possession 1400 acres of land
obtained fraudulently from the company; .
that through the dummy directors the
banks have received money, real and per
sonal property belonging to Grover & Co.,
arid- have deliberately and fraudulently
refused to credit It to the lumber firm.
Jeter Dominated Directors.
Grover charges'that at the direction of
these dummy directors, who were put Into
the corporation of Grover & Co. as direct
ors by Jeter, the books of the company ,
have been corruptly,' Improperly and dis
honestly kept in order that the fraudulent
transfer of property should not be discov
ered. .Not only this, but Grover claims
that William T. Jeter was present at the
meetings of the lumber; company and In
fluenced, directed and dominated the dum
my directors to ! suit j his .wishes.
In the supplemental' complaint, motion !
to file which was made to-day, to the court Â¦
and granted , even more Â¦Â¦'. serious ; allega
tions are made and are supported by the .
assertion that. the charges are based upon
testimony. .which} has, 'actually been pre
sented In. the. case. '* Grover declares that \
the officials of the Santa' Cruz' County^
Bank have deliberately taken money
which was on deposit by Grover & Co. in
the bank and paid It out without check,
order or authority to satisfy the cost of
attachment proceedings which the bank
levied upon the property of the company.
The plaintiff declares that ' the ' Santa
Cruz Bank of Savings and Loan began
foreclosure proceedings on the mortgage
and charged the costs of the same to
Grover & Co., He asserts that the Farm
ers' Union was Instigated by the bank of
ficials to attacn property' of the lumber
company, and then, through the acqui
escence of ex-Superior Judge J. H. Logan,
the cost of this suit, an altogether outside
affair, was charged to the. account of
Grover & Co. Not only this, but Grover
complains in his sworn document that the
bank paid for the service's of an attorney
for the lumber company, charged this ex
pense to Grover & Co. and knew that the
lumber firm had never employed the man
nor authorized, any payment to him.
Charge Against McKinney.
One of . the most remarkable allegations
In . this . supplemental complaint Is that
which Is made against H. E Maklnney,
the law partner of William T. Jeter.
After Grover & Co. had become Involved
Maklnney became one of the directors, but
the plaintiff in. these accounting proceed
ings charges that while Maklnney was a
director In the lumber corporation he be
came attorney for the Bank of Santa Cruz
County, of which William T. Jeter is
president, and went to Salinas and insti
tuted suit to foreclose certain property of
the corporation of which he was a di
rector.
Not only. this, but. Grover charges that
the Bank of Santa Cruz County paid the
traveling expenses of Makinney and vari
ous other costs of the" proceedings. At
various other times Grover declares that
the defendant banks had paid out sums
as high as $500 for many purposes In no
way connected with the affairs of. the lum
ber company and ' had charged them
against the account of Grover & Co., and
when this had been done ex-Judge Logan
as secretary and treasurer of the lumber
company had . accepted the receipts as
vouchers. Logan Is. also accused of hav
ing, signed checks , as president of the
lumber company when he. knew that he
did not occupy the position. ' f.
,- In outline, these are; the grave allega
tions which have given to Santa Cruz
County Its { most 'sensational suit. Vari
ous witnesses have been on the stand,
but the . sensation was not sprung until
to-day when- , the â¢supplemental Â¦ com

WASHINGTON. Dec. 5.â It was
quite generally expected that

years of age. He is a graduate of Harvard

He is a man of lnrse private fortune, so
that he will be able to maintain fittingly
tne high social status of the American

is believed to be the purpose of the Eng

United States Government contracts for
warships, armor plate and ordnance. The
report ha3 It that $7,500,000 has already
been offered for the Mldvale Company and
that the Cramps purchase will probably
be partly effected by issuing stock of the
new corporation to be formed when the
deal has been completed. *."Â¦â¢ " c

Regarding, the efforts made to secure
the Cramps 'shipyard, one man who la
well informed In steel matters, said*
"More than a year ago John Cros'sley,
manager of Vicker's Sons & Maxim, came
to America to purchase ;tho Cramps ship
yard. At that time it was understood that
the negotiations fell through. Beginning
these negotiations a second time means
probably that a purchase will be made.
Vicker s Sons and Maxim are the giants of
the businessâ the Krupps" of : Englandâ
and have unlimited capital. They. can

EL DORADO. Kans., Dec. 5.â Je^i-i
Morrison, charged with murder in the
first' degree, to-day tori the first time
since her trial . began, two weeks ago,
gave vent to her feelings of an
guish and sobbed in court. It was the
first sign of emotion that the defendant,
had displayed. It came when Judge Red
den, one of her attorneys,- pleading that
the statement of Mrs. Castle should not
be admitted as evidence, j declared the
words of accusation a gainst prisoner
were "the concoction of, men who sought
only to convict an Innocent girl."
Later Judge Shlnn ruled that Mrs. Cas
tle's statement could be placed before the
jury as evidence, but sustained the ob
jections of the defense to certain sen
tences there, among them the words, "by
my God It Is true," the only part of the
statement that the dying: woman wrote
herself. However, Judge Shlnn decided
that the .jury should hear "the evidence
given yesterday as to the manner in which
the statement was made. . It was, he said,
alone In the- province of the court to de
cide the mental condition of the declar
ant; the Jury should decide whether It
was Mrs. Castle's . own statement or
whether It might. have been influenced by
others.
This made It, necessary to have the tes
timony given yesterday repeated and tha
Jury was called In. Miss Morrison ap
peared more cheerful at the afternoon
session, but watched the proceeding* with
evident Impatience. The case now Is not
likely to go to the jury before the firs:
of next week because of this delay.
When the trial was lesumed to-day Mrs.
Castle's deathbed statement of accusa
tion against' Jessie Morrison was admitted
as evidence in the case. The statement
which declares that Miss Morrison pro
voked the quarrel with the bride and the:i
began an attack that . cost Mrs. Castle
her life is considered the strongest evi
dence presented by the State. The point
of Its admission, had been argued Bince
vesterday morning and during that time
the jury had been excused. *
In the final argument of Judge Redden,
one of the prisoner's attorneys, against
the admission of the statement he said
that Captain -Waters of. the State had de
picted the horror of the wounding of vhe
bride had painted the scene of sorrow at
the deathbed, "and now," sold the at
torney, "I understand the'purpose of th's
thin*. -Â¦ It was' an attack upon this de
fendant here to Intimidate her and cow
her and, If possible.- to break her down
and then point to it when' this case goea
before the Jury as evidence of her guilt;
or. If she could brace -herself against it
and by her will power not break down,
they would point to that as evidence of a
guilty conscience."
As Judge Redden talked he looked at
the i prisoner, whose Â¦ eyes were wet : with
tears. She gulped down a nob and hid
her 1 eyes -.with her. handkerchief. Miss
Morrison has steadfastly maintained com
plete control of herself as she sat through
the tedious examination of the State's
witnesses and this was her first Bfcow of
a breakdown. .';.,-, .
Judge Redden. continued. at, length. He
charged .that the dying declaration made
by :Mrs. Castle, was a concoction; of men
who sought to convict :an -innocent girl.

PROPOSED REDUCTIONS
IN THE WAR TAXES
Payne Introduces a Bill Providing for
Changes in Revenue Laws.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 5.â Senator Frye
fit to-day's session of the Senate con
cluded his speech upon the ship subsidy
bill. He devoted his attention principally
to a technical explanation of various pro
visions of the measure, explaining that
provision which would admit to American
racist ration for*isn built ships. From sev
eral sources his attention was directed to
this provision, and It is evidently one on
which much of the forthcoming debate
will rest.
Aside from rhe speech of Mr. Frye no
business of importance was transacted in
executive session.
When the session opened the credentials
of Samuel P. McEnery and Murphy J.
Foster aÂ« Senators from Louisiana and
George P. Wetmore from Rhode Island
were received.
Bills were passed admitting Captain B.
H. McCalla and Commander "\V. C. Wise
of the I'nited States navy to accept deco
rations from the Emperor of Germany.
The resolution introduced yesterday by
Mr. Pettigrew calling for information as
to the postal frauds in Cuba was referred
to the Committee on Relations with Cuba.
At 1:3 the Senate, on motion of Lodge,
went into executive session, remaining be
hind clnstd doors until 2 o'clock.
The House bill for the celebration of the
establishment of the seat of the National
Government in the city of Washington
was passed without discussion.
Consideration of the ship subsidy bill
was then resumed. Frye concluding his
F^f-ech begun yesterday. Frye said the
amount of subsidy could be no more than
19,000,000 per year. That limit, he said,
was fixed definitely in the bill.
"So far as the <-ost to the Government
is concerned." he added, "it will be really
no more than $7,500,000, as the subsidized
ships are required to carry the United
States mails free of cost to the Govern
ment."
There was absolutely no truth, accord
ing to Senator Frye. in the remarkable
FUtemcnt that $30,000,000 and $50,000,000 and
even as high as*$l'iO.O.M),Â©00 a year would be
the cost. The limit of $3,000,000 in the sub
tidy would not be reached for at least five
years-, be within that period there would
not be enough vessels to draw the full
fi mount of the subsidy. When the limit
of $9.<Â«0.O'W is reached the subsidy would
be pro-tatod. sa that all vessels would be
on precisely the same plane and would re
ceive perfectly impartial treatment.
Referring to a provision of the pending
bill requiring ail s=hips to take freight up
to a certain percentage of their carrying
capacity. Frye said It would prevent ves
k Is like the American liner St. Louis from
larticipatir.g in the benefits of the act.
He announced therefore that to-morrow
he would propose to the Committee on
Commerce an amendment providing for
equal to 30 per cent of the carrying ca
pacity when leaving a port of the United
Stain for a foreign port. That would so
â¢iistribute thf> products to be carried as to
do no injustice to anybody. ,
DlFcuFsjng the provision of the bi'.I
tvhkh enables foreign built ships to be
brought undei the American flag and to
enjoy a portion of the proposed subsidy
under ceiiain restrictions. Mr. Frye said
li had beeu asserted that 500,000 tons of
foreign voxels would come in at once
under the provision as it now stands. He
said It was his purpose to offer a substi
tute for the present provision so that it
could be determined definitely Just how
many foreign vessels would be admitted
to American registry.
Haie interrupted his colleague to direct
his attention to a memorial of shipbuild
ers which he had received. He said he
was in sympathy with the general provi
sions of the bill, but admitted that he was
troubled by that provision which enables
foreign built vessels to be brought under
the American flag to enjoy the proposed
subsidy. He had received, he added, a
strong protest against this provision of
the measure signed by forty or fifty ship
builders, in the course of w'hich the* state
ment was made that already parties are
* iiKaÂ«red In forelpn ship yards in the con
struction of vessels which were to partici
pate in the proposed subsidy.
"It is said." remarked Hale, "that the
bounty for foreign-built ships will amount
to more than ViJW.rw) a year. I do not
think my colleague would "look with favor
upon any such proposition as that." "?
Krye said there was only one trouble
with the statement made In the protest
and that was that it was not true.
. ."JLnder the provisions of the pending
run. said he, "owners of foreign-built
Fhips cannot draw a cent of bounty until
they construct in the shipyards of this
country en amount of tonnage equal to
that which they have brought from
abroad.
He believed a provision for the admis
sion of foreign-built ships under proper
reFtrictions wag wise, because it would
insure to the United States a respectable
fWt nf merchant vessels within a reason
able time.
The puree** of the venture by which the
New York and Paris had been admitted to
repif^ry had Induced him to insert in the
pending measure the provision for the ad
mission of a certain llxed number of for-
Hgn-built vessels to American registry
under similar restrictions. He did not be
lieve that another ship would be admitted
to American registry except those specifi
cally provided for in tho pending measure.
In conclusion Frye referred to what h-Â«
termed "the wild and insane criticisms"'
of the measure, criticism* which he said
were based upon no fair or accurate
knowledge of tht> provisions of the bill

SENATOR FRYE
EXPLAINS THE
SUBSIDY BILL
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5.â The . Hay-
Pauncefote treaty concerning the Nicara
guan canal was the subject of , a few
minutes' consideration to-day by the Seri
ate Committee' on Foreign Relations,
which has charge of the treaty in the
Senate. The treaty already has been re
ported by the committee and it was there
fore only taken up' in an informal way
and for discussion only. No conclusion
was possible except to decide to press the
question in the Senate and there was sub
stantial agreement upon the . wisdom of
this policy.' There- is no. division In thi
committee except upon amendments, al
though benator Bacon oid not Vnanifest
any great concern tor the passage of the
treaty in any snape. No voie on any sub
ject connected with me treaty was pos
sible in the committee, but tne discussion
revealed tne fact that the committee is
evenly divided upon the question of th-3
amendment of me document in accord
ance with the provision reported during
tne last, session of Congress, providing for.
the tortincation of tne proposed canal.
The committee stands: for the amend
mentâLodge and Clark, Republicans;
Daniel. Bacon and Money, Democrats.
Against itâ Frye, Cullom, Foraicer and
Wolcott, Republicans; Morgan, Democrat.
During the executive session tne Senate
also discussed the treaty.
Senator Lodge was subjected to many
questions during the presentation of his
explanation of the treaty.
benator Beveridge asked whether it was
not true that the abrogation of the Clay
ton-Bulwer treaty, as provided for in the
pending treaty, would have the effect of
permitting Great Britain to acquire prop
erty in the area affected.
Senator Lodge replied in the negative,
saying that it was well known to all that
tire liay-Pauncefote treaty, while abro
gating the Ciayton-Bulwer treaty so far
as it applies to the United States and
binds tnis country, still leaves England
bound by its terms. For this reason he
was sure there need be no apprehension
on that score.
Senator Lodge discussed the amendment
during the last session of Congress by the
Committee on Fof^lgn â¢ Relations, provid
ing that none of tlÂ»5 provisions of the first
live sections of thÂ«Jvreaty should be con
strued, as applying* to "measures whifch
the, United States may find it necessary
for securing by its own forces the defense
of the United States and the maintenance
of public order."
The Senator urged that this amendment
had the effect of giving greater assurance
to our own people and was a necessary
safeguard.
At this point Lindsay of Kerttucky in
terjected a question and in doing so made
a statement as to what he said he con
sidered a popular misapprehension as to
the effect of the amendment.
"I find," he said, "that most people ap
pear to think that this amendment pro
vides for the fortification of the canal,
whereas' it does nothing of the kind, as
a reading of It will demonstrate."
He quoted from the amendment, show
ing that it applied specifically to only sec
tions 1, 2. 3, 4 and 5 of article tw-o of the
treaty. He claimed that it only provides
In the most general way fof the protec
tion of the rights of the United States.
He called attention to the faot that while
the treaty of Constantinople applying to
the Suez canal had been used as the
basis of the -pending treaty only the first
seven articles had been incorporated in
the Hay-Pauncefote agreement, leaving
out article 10 of that agreement, which
gives to the Sultan of Egypt the right
to defend the interests of that country in
connection with the Suez canal.
Replying. Lodge had hot contended and
did not contend that the amendment con
ferred specifically the power to fortify
the canal'. The great benefit of the
amendment was found, he said, in the
fact that it applied to the first section
copied from the Constantinople agreement
providing that the canal "shall be free
and open In time of war as In time of
peace to the vessels of commerce and of
war of all nationB."
The amendment, he further said. Was
substantially in the language of article
10 of the Constantinople treaty and there
fore might be expected to serve the same
purposes intepded to b,e subserved "by that
article with reference to the Suez canal.
In conclusion. he urged early action on
the treaty as of great Importance, because
of the general desire to go on with, the
Nicaragua canal legislation.- He did not,
however, indicate nny time for taking a
vote upon either the 'treaty or' the com
mittee amendment. â¢ ; '
Money of Mississippi made a brief
speech In general opposition to the treaty,
but indicating that he might vote for it
if the amendment was retained, though
not satisfied, he said, that the amendment
â¢would make the document entirely satis
factory. Upon the whole he thought -the
United States would best promote Its own.
Interest by. proceeding to construct the
canal without asking the aid or consent
of any other country.
During the executive session in which
the Hay-Pauncefote treaty was under
consideration several comparatively un
important treaties with other countries,
largely South American, were laid before
the Senate and referred to the Committee
on Foreign Relations. Some of these were
reciprocity treaties and others extradition
agreements. One of them was a'recip
rocity agreement with Ecuador and an
other a treaty with* Denmark providing
for reciprocity with the Island of Santa
Cruz.
"Later In the day -a second executive ses
sion waB held, but' no. business was trans
acted beyond the reference of several
nominations to the proper committees.

12:40 o'clock this morning, completely de
molishing the boiler-house and the south

Ing in front of No. 1 when the explosion
occurred. He was hurled across the room
and against a brick wall. He was fright
fully burned by escaping steam, both arms
Â¦were broken and his-oody was cut and
bruised by Hying debris. He dragged him
self toward the west entrance to the boil

tleman and mine owner in British Colum
bia, California! Nevada and Mexico, has
come to Ught, but of the once vast estate
there is not left a. dollar as far as known
to pay the bequests named therein.
Harper came to the coast from Virginia
in '49 and amassed a fortune in mining
and cattle raising: He was a shrewd
financier and never-tiring worker " and
twenty-five years ago had rich mines and
thousands of head of cattle in British
Columbia, besides carrying on an exten
sive trading business. He had other
ranches and mlnlnpr interests In Califor
nia, Nevada, and Mexico. At that time
neriiiade the will which has Just come to
light, leaving $175,000 in direct bequests to
his brothers and .their children. A few
years later he was kicked by a horse and
lost his reason and the once shrewd busi
ness man became easy prey for schemers,'
with the result that his fortune slipped
from him and he died, as far as the pub
lic knew, penniless. There are some min
ing shares on which dividends of $300 are
due" and his friends say he must have left
personal property, but where it is is an
other question.

to obtain possession of a pieceiof land in
East San Jose, which, she claims, Is being

the Government's experiment with the
reindeer was unsuccessful for several rea

"The country did not suit either us or
the reindeer. It was cold enough, but It
was different in other ways. The deer did.
not get the same things to eat that they
did in Lapland and they did not get ths
same treatment. When we arrived In
Alaska the deer were distributed and each
of us went with a cfirtain number to a
certain place. The men wonting with us
did not know the habits of the animals

TACOMA, Dec. a.â Martin Stickel, one of
the assassins of pioneer Cornelius Knapp
and his wife, near Castle Rock, in Cow
litz County, on Wednesday night of last
week, was arrested in a scow on the
Columbia River, near the mouth of the
Cowlitz River, and brought to the Jail
in Tacoma to-day by Sheriff Kirby, who
feared that the man' would be lynched.
Stickel has made a confession, declar
ing the crime was planned by him and
Ed Pierce about a week before It was
committed. Stlckel's arrest has cleared
the mystery surrounding the murder of
a rancher named Shaaklin In that part
of the country a. year ago. The works of
Shanklin's watch were found in another
case* in Stickel's possession, and he con
fessed this murder as well as that of
Knapp, saying he and Pierce committed
all three crimes. He said they got about
$30 and a watch from Shanklin. Pierce
took the watchcase and gave him the
works. They obtained little booty from
the Ivnapps, the horrible double tragedy
netting the assassins but $3.
Stickel talks freely of the latter crime,
paying that he and Pierce planned it a
wc-ek previous. They believed the Knapps
had money because they lived alone and
had no one to take care of them. He
says Pierce did the shooting with Stickers
gun. Both regretted having molested the
old couple 'when they found no money
in- the house. :Â¦.,-*;"

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER. Dec. 5.â The campaign
closing to-night preliminary to : the elec
tion to-morrow for the representation of
the district of Burrard In the House of
Commons has been one of the . most ex
traordinary' in the history- of Canadian
politics. The Liberal candidate, who is a
supporter of the' Government of Sir Wil
frid Laurler, is Row George R. Maxwell,
a Presbyterian clergyman. His opponent,
Mayor James F. Garden. of Vancouver, is
the Conservative candidate.
'-, The campaign has been unique In the
history of. Parliamentary contests in Can
ada.: Although the result affects only a
single seat in the House of Commons,.ex
traordinary, efforts to win have been made
by both parties. Leaders on both sides
came all the way from Ottawa to par
ticipate in the contest. The opposition is
especially anxious to* administer a rebuke
to the . Krench-Canadians for so largely
supporting the Premier of their own race,
Sir Wilfrid I^iurier, whose greatest ma
jority was gained trom Quebec- Tne Gov
ernment desirea to punish tne Conserv- ;
atives for navmg brought up the ques
tions of race and creea in the .analysis
of the Liberal majority, i
A tremendous amount of racial and re
ligious strife has been engendered by the
campaign, riir Charles Tupper, the octo
genarian politician, who is retiring from
tne Conservative leadership after having
spent torty-nve years in public life, de
ciared in a recent speech that Canuda's
future, her very existence, was dependent
upon a vigorous resistance of French ag
gression. French-Canadian Liberals were
pictured as traitors to Canada and as foes
of the British empire, waiting and watch
ing for the moment when \hey could
throw off British domination.
The sovereign grand master of the
Orange Order in Canada, Hon. Clark Wal
lace, himself a Conservative member of \
Parliament, came out to Vancouver from
Toronto especially to participate* in the
campaign, and as Roman Catholics are
proportionately few in number in British
Columbia, pro-Protestant and anti-French
feeling was considerably accelerated , by
his speeches.
Although the Conservatives in Canada
have always been especially opposed to
any suggestion that the Dominion should
be annexed by the United States, numbers
of prominent supporters of the opposition
privately declared their conviction that
unless French-Canadians were effective
ly suppressed by a united English-speak
ing vote against the Government they
would be driven into annexation as the
only solution of an unbearable situation.
A great deal of Conservative capital has
been made out of the allegations of Lib
eral maladministration in the Yukon.
Specific charges of corruption, peculation
and favoritism resulting from bribery
were made".
To all the onslaughts made against It,
the Government has made what was
termed "a practical reply." It was to this
effect: The Government has a large ma
jority in the House. Vancouver needs
various public buildings, harbor improve
ments and shipping facilities. Elect the
Government candidate. Rev. George R.
Maxwell, and all these things shall be
given to you: a mint will be located in
Vancouver, the harbor will be dredged,
and Federal lands will be deeded to the
city. "On the other hand, elect the oppo
sition candidate,. James F. Garden, who
has been three, times Mayor of the city,
and you get nothing. , -
The district of Burrard is extensive,
reaching from Vancouver north to Atlln,
and unless the vote of the city of Van
couver gives a decided majority to one
candidate, the result will be in doubt for
several weeks until returns are received
from outlying polling places.
An election will be held to-morrow In
the Yale-Cariboo district, embracing the
eastern Interior of British Columbia, but
the. result in that constituency is not
deemed so Important.

received atthe hands, or rather tongue, of
Bridget White, also a scrub woman. Mrs.
Dowd In her complaint charges Mrs.
White with having Â¦vilified 1 and slandered
her, with having taken her good name
away from her. aÂ« she herself put It, in a
public place, and she demanded damages
in the sum of 13)00. -
The caÂ«e wad tried before Lnder Sheriff
Mulroney and the Morgan-Rockefeller
jurv in one of the Supreme Court rooms
in the Tweed courthouse. Able counsel
represented both parties. Benjamin F.
Spellman represented the .plaintiff and
former Senator Eccles appeared for the
defendant. Full details of the unfortunate
differences between Mrs. Dowd. and Mrs.
White were brought out before Mr. Mor
gan Mr. Rockefeller and their fellow
jurymen under the skillful questioning of
the learned counsel. Wherr the testimony
and arguments were completed the Jury
took the case and Mr. Morgan -and- Mr.
-Rockefeller lent their tlnancial acumen to
the assessment of the damages Mrs.
Dowd had sustained. This they fixed at
tJO just $1350 less than Mrs. Dowd had
asked for. but enough to carry the costs,
which, with the penalty, fell upon Mrs.
White. In addition to this case Mr. Mor
gan and Mr. Rockefeller sat the same day
in five other Sheriff's jury cases.
In the case of Mrs. Dowd against Mrs.
White neither Mr. Rockefeller nor Mr.
Morgan got a cent for his services, for it
was what is known as a pauper case. The
complainant had no money to pay the fees
and as the county will not pay them the

MARCONI SYSTEM
PROVES SUCCESS
Messages Exchanged Ba
tween Shores of England
<. and Belgium.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5.â Consul Roose
velt at Brussels reports to the State De
partment that a station has, been estab
lished at La Panne, Belgium, for the ex
change of wireless telegraphic messages
between Belgium and England. Â¦
La Panne was selected on account of its
being the point of Belgium nearest the
English coast. A mast of the Marconi
system, thirty feet high, was erected
there. The Dover-Ost end' mail boat Prin
cess Clementine was fitted up with tem
porary apparatus for use in experimental
trials. An additional mast was affixed to
the foremast of ihis vessel, increasing
its original height about eixty feet. From
that extremity the telegraphic waves are
projected' toward each coast. A special
room has been fitted up on the steamer
for the instruments and from that room
the cable is carried to the top of the ex
tended mast. It is confidently expected
to maintain communication between ship
and shore for at least thirty miles, which
is about half-way across. With stations
at La Panne and Dover those on board
the vessel will be able to keep in touch
with the land during the entire trip
across. Recent experiments showed* that
replies arrived with the same regularity
and celerity as ordinary telegTams. When
about forty miles from Ostend the cap
tain was able to telegraph the station
master at Ostend the probable hour of
his arrival. Various telegrams .were sent
from the vessel to Ostend, Brussels, Do
ver and London, and the reception of each
message was acknowledged promptly.
Subsequently, the Consul adds, a mes
sage was sent from the vessel to the sta
tion at Dover Court, Essex, a distance of
nearly ninety miles, including many miles
of cliffs and sea.

NAMES THE VARIOUS COMMITTEES
oi any Irregular practices regarding the
issuance of diplomas during his connec
tion with the college. v
"Dr. Anderson had charge of passing
upon the credentials of those students
whosS advanced standing would permit of
their taking a shorter course. He re
ceived all the fees and deposited them In
the bank to his personal credit, as he did
all other funds of the institution. "We
never'could get an accounting from him,
and this is what has probably given rise
to the statement regarding alleged Irreg
ularities. I do not think any member of
the faculty would willingly or knowingly
assist in any practices of this kind.
"If there is any trick or device that Dr.
Anderson can make use of for his per
sonal and financial advancement, for tho
glory of seeing his name in print or keep
ing himself In the public eye he does not
hesitate at the means or measures that
he will use to accomplish his ends. As
the head of the College of Physicians and
Surgeons he occupies, he thinks, a posi
tion second only to that of a president of
a great institution. Instead of a small
enÂ© torn with Internal dissensions and be
tween whose faculty and trustees there

PRESIDENT OF THE COLLEGE
AND TWO TRUSTEES WHO
RESIGNED.
"Dr. Anderson by these practices dis
gusted all except the members of the
board of trustees who were his personal
satellites. Dr. Hodghead. the editor of
Dr. Anderson's paper, over whom he
claims to hold the sword of Damocles,
was made dean of the faculty. Dr. An
derson always insisted that we should
meet in his office, instead of the college
building. Some of the members of the
board hesitated about violating the rules
of hospitality by talking out as they
would like in his office. So we went down
to the cojlege for a few meetings, but the
storm that broke around the doctor's ears
was so great that he maneuvered until he
could get us back to his' office.
"When the trustees at the time of the
purchase of the lot found that there was
not enough money on hand to meet re
quirements, we started out to get it. We
borrowed some from Davies, the janitor,
Mrs. Dr. Southard, Mrs. Winslow Ander
son, the head nurse of Dr. Anderson's
hospital, and a fÂ«w others. On this money
we were paying 8 per cent interest. Dr.
Potter wanted the notes taken up at once,
but Anderson objected when it Â¦ came to
those of his Immediate friends, who were
drawing good interest."
Dr. Lalne said that he had never heard
Dr. J. L. Lalne, who resigned; from the
board of trustees some- months. ago, .was
one of the prime movers in the estab
lishment of the college and made the
ilnancial arrangements, which led to the
purchase of the lot on Fourteenth street
and the erection of the present building.
"I left the board of trustees," said Dr.
I.aine last night, "more in sorrow than
in anger. I never did believe in a one
man institution and none such can be
successfully conducted. When the build
ing was projected I went out and found
the 'lot. Then at a meeting of the board
of trustees I asked how much money
there was in the treasury. Dr. Anderson
promptly answered about $11,000. I said
then we would go ahead and buy the lot.
But when we came to find out Just how
much money we had, we were several
thousand dollars short. I made an ef
fort to find out the condition of the treas
sury. but do as I could. Dr. Anderson
would not render an accounting. He
fought every motion looking to an exam
ination of the books. Swelling with imÂ«
portance and a voice oftentimes hic
coughy, he would declare himself 'tho
whole thing." There was no getting an
accounting from him. -
"We objected to his receiving all the
funds of the institution. He constituted
himself treasurer, auditor and paymaster,
bU In one person. When bills were to be
paid he would draw a check for the
amount needed, turn it over to Dr. South
ard, who would pay out the money and
account for the amount received from Dr.
Anderson. /
That the position taken by Dr. Potter is
sustained by other members of the fac
ulty is evidenced by the resignations that
have been presented to the board of trus
tees. In addition to Dr. Potter, Dr. E. E.
Kelly, profe3->or of anatomy, and Dr. Al
fred E. Regensburger. professor of derm
atology, have already resigned. Dr.
Sophie B. Koblcke, adjunct to a chair of
gynecology, and I>r. \V. Freeman South
ard, are said to have asked that their
names be placed in the list of those who
have been proicssors and lecturers at the
institution. And there are more to follow
in their footsteps.
Dr. John H. Ilealy, one of the formor
superintendents of the City and County
Hospital, who achieved his due share of
newspaper notoriety during his incum
bency of that position, is a stanch sup
porter of Dr. Winslow Anderson's man
agement of the College of Physicians and
Surgeons.
"You will find all kinds of malcontents
among a large body of medical men."
said Dr. Healy, "and each man who can
not run the "institution" to suit himself
has a grievance. Dr. Potter is arrogant.
Dr. Regensburger is eccentric and Dr.
Inline. guve up his position as lecturer be
cause 1 advised him to on account of his
health. I might easily find similar ex
cuses for the conduct of each man."
Dr. Healy maintains that the standard
of studies at the college is as high as
that of any similar institution and that
the graduates thereof are just as compe
tent to lead a sick person through the
tortuous paths of illness as those of any
other.'
"Lots of men pass a good written ex
amination," said Dr. Healy, "who are net
fitted to be doctors. Their papers read all
right, they have to be marked with the
proper percentages and they get their
diplomas. But they,- never ought to bo
graduated."
Just when the trouble will end and how
many of the faculty will sever their con
nection with the institution is a question.
Dr. Winslow Anderson, the president, and
factotum of the college, says:
"The College of Physicians and "Sur
geons is filling a long-felt want. We are
giving exactly the same course as other
colleges and are maintaining a high stand
ard in examinations. We plucked at least
six at the last commencement because
they did not .come up to requirements. We
have an attendance of between 300 and 350
students In the three departmentsâmedi
cine, pharmacy and odontology. There are
always some dissatisfied ones In every
faculty." but they are generally of small
caliber."
been made, either to the trustees or to the 1
original members of the college. i
14. - Though the law and our constitution I
provide that the board of trustees may con
sist of fifteen members every suggestion to add
to its number has been refused by several
members thereof, giving as a reason that a
small board Is easier to control than a large
one, or words of similar import.
15. One member of the board has publicly
taken the position (in which he has been sup
ported by -several other' trustees) that any
member of the faculty who says anything
against him Is a "traitor" to the college. Thl3
particular member is constantly making col
lege questions of his personal grievances,
thereby assuming that this college Is a "one
man school," owned by him and ruled by his
will. When other trustees support this posi
tion, as they have done, it shows a tendency
tcward a "one-man concern," which certainly
was far from the Intention of the incorporators
of the college and must eventually ruin the In
sMtution. Very respe^full^
Trustee of the College of Physicians and Sur
geons of San Francisco.
to-rpcflOO much Anderson," seems to be
I the slogan that calls the faculty
I of the College of Physicians and
It Surgeons, located on Fourteenth
street, between Valencia and Mis
sion, to arms. . Some there are who are
unkind enough to say that the practices
of some of the faculty are not in" strict
accord with the- tenets of the Hlppocratic
oath, taken on graduation from a recog
nized school of medicine. Others lay the
blame at the fioor of the president and
projector of the college, and many of the
professors have resigned their chairs In
order i that their professional standing
may not be tainted with the odor, color,
or whatever else it may be, of unprofes
sional conduct.
The College of Physicians and Surgeons
was organized about five years ago under
the provisions of the special law of the
State relating to "colleges and seminaries
of learning." Dr. Winslow Anderson, A.
M.. M. D., M. R. C. P. Lond., M. R. C. S.
Eng., etc., was the prime mover in the
organization of the college. He gathered
around him a staff of physicians who
were eminent in their, respective special
branches. Everything ..went - along har
moniously for a time, and then, the trouble
began and the doctors agreed to disagree.
The original prospectus of the college in
cluded only the practice of medicine.
Other branches were afterward- added,
pharmacy and odontology being the two
principal, and graduates of these branches
were turned loose to prey upon the public,
say the dissatisfied ones, under the guise
of M. D.'s and backed by a diploma from
the college.
Men who failed to pass their "exams"
at other colleges, it is claimed, went to
the College of Physicians and Surgeons,
where the payment of the $100 fee for-tui
tion per annum was the open sesame for
a diploma.
While no positive evidence exists that
diplomas were handed out on the same
principle as obtained in the notorious Bu
chanan Medical College of Philadelphia,
still members of the faculty do not like
the methods followed by the president and
the dean of the faculty. Dr. D. A. Hodg
head, who has an office in the private
sanatorium of Dr. Anderson, on Sutter
S Dr! Samuel O. L. Potter. A. M., M. D.,
M. R. C. P." Lond., late major and brigade
surgeon, U. S. V., professor of principles
and practice of medicine and clinical
medicine, is one of the most aggressive
lighters againsi the present management.
In a long communication, filed with the
board of trustees of the college, Dr. Pot
ter does not hesitate to express his
opinion in the strongest and most polite
English at his command.
In order to understand the situation it
should be noted that the College of Phy
sicians and Surgeons is. according to its
president, the outgrowth of a "long-felt
want." This "long-felt want" has result
ed in the purchase of a lot. the erection
j of a building and the engagement ot a
I corps of physicians and lecturers (who de
clare they have not been paid) at an ex
pense of some $40,000. A building and
loan association was found that was will
ing to advance the funds for the construc
tion of thf building and the purchase of
the lot. Since its organization about $80,
000 In tuition fees has been received by the
management. Where a large portion of
this has gone is what some of the pro
fessors and demonstrators would like to
know.
Of the staff of physicians which origin
ally composed the faculty a number have
resigned. So have a number of the trus
| tees, notably Dr. S. M. Mouser and Dr.
J. R. Laine.. They do not hesitate to say
that the practices of some of the mem
bers of the board of trustees were not
\ strictly up to the rules of good old Hip
pocrates.
The matter of the disruption among
the faculty, trustees and others interested
in the college may soon be taken into the
courts. Such an action is now impend
ing. But, as it is feared that this will in
jure the standing of the college, some
hesitancy has been displayed regarding
the commencement of legal proceedings.
Dr. Potter, in his letter of resignation to
the trustees, says:
The principal changes in policy and the chief
Injurious actions of administration to which
1 refer are as follows:
1. You have established a pharmaceutical
department, which was not Included in the
purposes for which the college was incor
porated. In this department you have issued
diplomas Identical in appearance and In ell
except a few Latin "tvords with our medical
diploma, thereby "covering" the possible ille
gal practice of medicine by pharmacists claim
ing: to be graduates of a college of physicians '
and surgeons.
2. You have permitted, if not encouraged,
the gradual abandonment of our original agree
ment, namely, that the dental department
should be subordinate to the medical, and that
the former should require its students to lake
all possible lectures and work under the medl-r
cal chairs. In place of this the dental depart
ment Is gradually assuming the position of an
Independent body and demanding control of Its
own teaching and the power to dismiss It*
teachers at the- will of one or two persons. It is
j shewing itself to be governed by different pro
! fefslonal and" financial principles from those
of the nWical department and has already re
ceived much more than its proper share of sal
aries, outtlt and expenditure?.
Z. You have departed from our original agree
nunt by dividing chairs 'without the consent
of their Incumbents and by Increasing the num
tÂ«r of teaehTS published to the world as "pro
fessors." this latter to an inordinate degree.
4. you have published in official publication!*
the names of teachers as "professors" who
were not and are not professors in the college.
5. Students have been admitted to tho final
examinations who had not compiled with your
published rules as to attendance or payment of
fees. .
6. Students have been graduated who had
not settled in full with the college, contrary to
yÂ«.ur published regulation*.
7. For over two years a vacancy on the com
mittee en advanced standing has .remained un
filled, leaving that important committee In the
hands of one person, who was during most of
the time the dean of the college also. The
result of this neglect is that students huve
been admitted to advanced standing without
having furnished the proper evidence for their
claims required by your rules, by the customs
of all flrst-class American medical colleges and
by the regulations of the State Board of Ex
aminers.
8 The faculty has been systematically ig
nored by the trustees, particularly in regard
to expenditures, money requisitions which were,
voted down almost unanimously by the faculty
having been appropriated by the trustees wlth
cut further reference or consultation. This
treatment of the men who are earning the in
come of the college may be legal, but it Is
not good policy. '
9 Expenditures have, from the- very begln
r.inr been lavish and. of ten unwise, among the
latter being those for entertaining visiting com
mittees, legal and legislative expenses, traveling
trips to the Eastern States, eta. all of which
heve been made without consulting the teaching
body which earns the Income of the college.
10. ' Purchases are and have been made in a
most unbusinesslike manner. This Is true of
even the largest purchases, no requirements
bring made as to receiving bids, but the pur
chaser's "O. K." being accepted at audit by
the board without question if the purchaser was
a trustee.
11. The business patronage of the college has
been used in many instances for the benefit
ot friends of certain trustees, without refer
â¢ence to the board for Its action.
12. The financial records of the college have
been and are still kept in such a manner that
no titatistlcal Information can be obtained from
them by individual trustees or committees
without employing an expert accountant at
heavy expense to unravel the maze. Two such
experts have been employed, both of whom
condemned our system of bookkeeping as In
comprehensible and unreliable.
13. Since the flr^t year of our existence no
annual detailed financial statement of the re
ceipts and disbursements of the college has

Made That Diplomas Are Too Easily Obtained.

Growth of the . Principle of Liberty-
Traced to Its Historical
Source!
The principal feature of the meeting of
the British-American Union- in the Acad
emy of Sciences' Hall last night was an
address by Irving M. Scott. Mr. Scott's
lecture was a careful historical review of
the gTowth of the principles of liberty and
freedom from the days of the English
Puritans down to the re-election of Presi
dent McKlnley. The lecturer insisted con
stantly that the people, under God, are
the source of power.
After a song by Mrs. John J. TCewbegin,
with a violin obligate by Professor Keogh,
WVA. Nicholson addressed Â¦ the meeting,
IRVING SCOTT SPEAKS
:Â¦{ : TO BRITISH-AMERICANS
explaining that he is an American who
highly approves of union between Great
Britain and the United Statesâ not a po
litical union, but a union of ideas and
sentiments. He was followed : by Taliesin
JEvans, who declared that the Welsh
people had always been fully loya.1 to the
British empire.
Dr. d'Evelyn,. in a humorous speech.,
stated that the' British-American Union
has already established a system whereby,
Americans who are members of the union
may, on visiting Great Britain, be re-*

THE action brought on Tuesday by E. M. Far
rell in which he asks the Justice's Court to de
cree to him the return of five cents illegally col
lected by Wells. Fargo & Co. for the payment of the
corporation's war taxes on five packages "of merchan
dise tendered for transportation may seem a small af
fair to the ordinary reader, yet it involves a principle
which ought not to be regarded lightly in this juris
diction.
The war revenue act was enacted by Congress in
June, 1898. and Wells. Fargo & Co. has ever since
managed to make its patrons in California pay the
taxes imposed upon it by that statute. Every effort
to bring the tax-shirking corporation to terms has
been evaded, either by open defiance of the decrees
of the courts or by cleverly manipulating the litiga
tion brought to determine the illegality of its posi
tion. These taxes have been computed to amount to
$10,000 a month in this State alone. Ever since June,
1898, therefore, our people have been paying that
amount monthly for the luxury of patronizing an un
patriotic, hypocritical, tax-shirking corporation.
It has been fortunate for- the express company that
the amounts of which it defrauds its patrons in de
tail are small. If they had amounted to more than
one cent in any individual case probably it would
long ago have been brought to terms. But it appears
that so long as people are robbed in California of one
cent at a time they will submit to the outrage. In
Mr> Farrell, however, the community is to be con
gratulated on having discovered a public-spirited 1
citizen who is willing to hire a lawyer and make a
fight.
No decision by any court in the country, from the
Supreme Court of the United States down, has ever
justified Wells, Fargo & Co. in maintaining the po
sition it assumes with reference to these war taxes.
Two local Judges have decided against it, and half
a dozen tribunals in the East have made similar
rulings. In all these cases it-has been held thatun
der the revenue law the corporation must affix stamps
to its bills of lading and pay for them. The Supreme
Court of the United States, in the celebrated case of
the American Express Company vs. Maynard, con
curred in the view taken of Â«the duties of the express
companies, but held that the tax could be shifted by
the' express incorrigible.
i "The facts cited by the writer attest the value of the
rating system and its essential accuracy. It also shows
to what extent railway economics are indebted to
mathemetical science. Much has been saved to the
road by these calculations, and the men who have
worked them out for the company may be well es
teemed among its most useful employes.
After a careful and elaborate explanation ' of the
data upon which the calculations are based and the
methods of working out the problems of rating. Mr.
Worthington gives several illustrations showing how
closely the results of actual operation accord with
those of theoretical estimates. A single one will suf
fice here. Mr.AVorthington says: "Test No. 1 was
from Tucson to Gila Bend, 128 miles. Our figures
showed that a load of 2600 Ms net weight of train
should be taken with a 'D A* ten-wheeler, with
helper, over the Estrella Hill in 5 hours and 15 min
utes, net running time between stations (excluding
stops); the actual performance was 2623 Ms in, 5
hours and two minutes."
The object of the rating is to determine what work
can be accomplished by a given locomotive on a given
track within a given time, in order that the managers
of the road may make the fullest and most economical
use of the power at their disposal. It is. stated that
the first tonnage rating was introduced by. General
Manager Kruttschnitt on all Pacific system divisions
July I, 1897, and of the results the writer says: "The
year previous to its introduction the tons of revenue
freight per freight engine mile averaged 188. \ Dur
ing the two years following July 1, 1897, this load in
creased to 207 tons, while in the third year, or year
ending June 30, 1900, it had grown to 235 tons. The
new tonnage ratings were put into general effect in
the spring of 1900, and for seven months ending Sep
lember 30, 1900, when they were generally used, the
Pacific system load per freight engine mile increased
to 251 tons of revenue freight, or one-third more than
it was in 1897 before we had the tonnage rating sys-

A NEW BRITISH ISSUE.
1~ HE English Liberals, beaten by the jingo spirit
which has taken possession'of the British pub
iic, are looking forward to an issue upon which
they can go before the people when the war spirit has
tper.t itself.
Lord Rosebery is evidently making that issue. He
says: "We must spread abroad the blessings of edu
cation. The twentieth century will put us into the
crucible. We shall be tested in the fire of interna
tional competition. How shall we bear that test? Can
we bear it. unless our children grow up under condi
tions as favorable to their intellectual and moral de
velopment as those of our competitors? America
gives free education \o every person in that republic
between, the ages of 6 and 25. Many of the com
paratively insignificant nations excel us in the matter
of educating their children. We must wake up. We
must prepare to do battle with peoples disciplined for
intelligent fighting."
The Right Hon. Heibert Henry Asquith. address
ing the Leeds Chamber of Commerce, unsparingly
condemned the British educational system, and praised
that of the United States.
It may well be that the next struggle between par
ties in Great Britain will be over the introduction of
the American public school system into that king
dom, ar.d then we nuv witness the unusual spectacle
ot American educators being invited to take part in
an English campaign.
Lord Rosebery and other promoters of this new
issue ascribe the success of American competition
with British trade to the superior intelligence of the
American masses brought about by our general sys
tem ot common schools.
It is pleasing and gratifying to our pride to have
our system so highly indorsed by those who see it 1:1

OUTRAGES iN CHINA.
OF ail the ?tories that have been reported of out
rages committed by the armies of civilization
in China, none is more significant of barbarity
than that embodied in a complaint said to have been
made by the American board of certain actions com
mitted by the Germans and the Japanese. The story
is. to the effect that the Boxers, perceiving how willing
the troops o? those nations are to kill Chinamen, hav
taken advantage of it to involve Christian natives in
the slaughter. It is stated that emissaries of the
Boxers have succeeded in getting employment as in
former* of the allies, and as such have pointed out
Christians as Boxers, and thus procured their death.
In war's "black caldron of confusion" the innocent
suffer with the guilty. That is unavoidable. As Gen
eral Sherman said, "War is hell." When once it has
begun no man can tell when it will stop, or what sav
agery will be committed while it lasts. All that will
be conceded, but still it would seem possible for the
commanding officers of the allied troops in China to
exercise a sufficient care to prevent the outrages stated
in that report. It appears the persons accused \Â»y
the informers are shot summarily, for otherwise the
Christian natives could find* evidence to prove their
innocence.
The civilized wprld will not sympathize with China
men as it does with the Boers, for race prejudices ars
strong,' but still even prejudice will hardly lead men
to condone such conduct as that attributed to the Jap
anese and the Germans in this instance. The prime
object of the invasion of China, is to put an end to
the barbarities practiced there, but if the' invasion be
attended with such a wanton disregard of the rights
of the Chinese people as the killing of innocent men
without trial, the result will be the very opposite of
that desired. It requires no f?reat amount of wisdom
to perceive that Christianity cannot civilize paganism
by practicing the barbarities of paganism.
The movement to reform, car conductors
had Its inception after the adjournment
of a woman's meeting held for another
purpose. The speclflo occurrence which
inspired the organization of the Anti-
Conductor League was described by one
of the women present- She had comÂ© to
the meeting on an Amsterdam-avenue
Rule 4 â Members agree to make these signed
reports to the president 'or secretary of the
league, in order that when a sufficient number
have been received they may become the basis
of action by the league looking to the, desired
reform.
Rule 3 â In the event of discourteous, treat
ment members pledge themselves to make and
sign a report of the occurrence, giving the
number of the car and of the conductor, and
the date and hour of the objectionable act.
Rule 2 â Kach member pledges herself to re

That the Women's Anti-Conductor

ment Is Indicated In the following rule3,
to which the members have subscribed:

Clearly the Eastern people have some erroneous
ideas about California, and it is incumbent upon us to
correct those errors even if to do so we have to ship
back to the New Yorkers their undesired wives and
kill ever}' Kansas tenderfoot caught ordering mince
pie within the confines of this commonwealth.
Now it is not :'ice to have it bruited abroad that
one can get better fruit in Chicago than in Califor
nia, and that we cannot furnish wayfaring men with
mince pie equal to the Kansas standard. Nor is it
nice to know that New Yorkers are sending the raw
cabbage wives to fill up the State. Evidently the Kan
sas man must have met a community of Eastern immi
grants somewhere and mistook them for natives.
How else could be have found in this State a mince
pie substituting currants for raisins? How else could
he have come to the conclusion that the Californian
is stingier than a "goat-faced Mennonite"?
An illustration of the evil that results from that
state of affairs is to be found in a letter recently pub
lished in the Kansas City Journal from'a Kansas man
now traveling in Southern California. He says:
"California is as brown as ginger and just as dry.
Still I like the State pretty well. I should like it bet
ter if they would keep some of their good things at
home. Almost air their fine fruit is eaten in Chicago,
and I am told that the best of their wines also are
shipped away. I do not care about the wines, but I
do want fruit. The other day I ordered a piece of
nnnce pie at a restaurant, supposing of course that in
this land of high-tariff raisins at least one of the com
ponent parts would not be bogus, and I was abso
lutely disgusted to find the sallow and shamefaced
crust covering the cheapest currants. This tells you
as much about the economies of California as I could
give you if I were to write a book. And, speaking
of parsimony, I think that as between the Californian
and your goat-faced Mennonite, the gentle exile from
Russia is a nois3* spendthrift."
The revelation thus made that some New York
husbands send to this State wives who delight in liv
ing on raw cabbage and other food of the kind brings
before us one of the evils against which we hffye" to
contend. There seems to be an idea among certain
classes of the East that any old thing will do for Cali
fornia, and the result is we get a good many inhabit
ants we could really do without.
All of that is to us only a matter of idle curiosity,
but we are concerned in this statement: "Every
one had a burning desire to speak. A member
who had listened with evident impatience declared
that she knew a woman who had gone a step further
in this direction. She established in her home a diet
of raw cabbage, pecan nuts and water. Later she
adopted Greek attire and went barefoot. Her hus
band then sent her to Southern California to tread
the sands, where he would not be mortified by seeing
her. 1 '
AT a recent meeting of the "Women's Society
for Political Study" one of the members read
a paper on the advantages of eating raw food.
The New York Press in reporting the meeting tells
us the paper excited a redhot discussion, in the
midst of which a motion to adjourn was put and car
ried, but without effect, for the members stuck to the
floor and continued to argue until dark.

The United States desires, abeve all
things, a settlement with China that will
promote the interests of common human
ity ar.d civilization. Thia cannot be ob
tained by imposing upon China impossi
ble terms or by forcing punishments that
seem excessive to both the official and
public intelligence of China. It is not
meant by this that China should not bo
made to pay indemnities to the limit of its
ability or to inflict punishment to the
limit of its ordinary powers But there
is no sense in making xlemands that will
arouse the hatred and defiance of every
Chinaman and incite them to begin war

they would regard* as a dishonorablo

Noise a Nuisance.
There are those who affect to regard
noise as inevitable: indeed, as something:
to be encouraged and to feel proud of as
an indication of energy and "strenuous
life." The most potent processes in na
ture are quite noiseless, while those which
are fHll of sound and fury signify little
save ruin and destruction. Needless noise
is an indication not so much of energy a.*
of waste of energy. It Is barbaric, child
ish, even at the best and when it disturbs
no oneâ which Is seldom. In the vast ma
jority of cases in the streets of a populous
city it is an infringement upon personal
rights and an assault upon personal peace,
comfort and health, such as is most mila
ly to be described as a nuisance, and
might with propriety be called by a much
harsher name.â NEW YORK TRIBUNE.
England's Coal Problem.

STREET CAR CONDUCTOR
SAID "UMPTY BAZAZAS."
That's Why Some New York Women Are
Bound to Reform Him.
THE annual convention i of California - fruit
growers, now in session in 'this city, is found to
represent the progressive development of that
interest.
In the beginning of the industry the pioneer grow
ers discussed planting and production. This was , a
new field. Horticulture, like all industries related to
the soil, had to advance by experiment. There is
nothing in the earth, nor under the earth, nor above,
the earth, to mark the locality that is best for prunes,
or apricots, or cherries, or peaches. That had to be
found out by experiment, and experiment took time,
for fruit is not like grain, the adaptability of which
to a locality can be determined in a season.
Experiment has now fairly mapped our horticultural
field. We know that it is useless to plant certain
kinds in certain localities, for there is a lack of chem
ical and climatic kindness to their production. The
loss of time and energy in these experiments should
be called something else than a loss, since it produced
the sought-for gain by the information and enlighten
ment which followed. The intelligent planter need no
longer risk his plant by misplacing it. . So the in
dustry has passed out of the stage of experiment in.
production. The orchards of pur great variety of
fruits are distributed as experience has dictated, and
the problem now upon the growers is the profitable
distribution of tljeir crops. Before them is the per
manent certainty of a demand, foreign and domes
tic, which will take every pound of perfect fruit, in
some consumable form, at a profit to the grower.
What the grower must study is the form in which the
market will take his product, and the best means of
reaching that market at the right time.
The latter is a matter of transportation, and should
be settled by the operation of enlightened selfishness
on the part of the railways. They want the tonnage.
They want it to increase and not diminish. They
want it to be a constant factor in their annual busi
ness, in order that they may prepare to carry it, and
that its facilities may be a permanent and remunera
tive part of their equipment. Wisdom on their part
dictates the provision of such facilities as will return
a profit to the producer, and encourage the enlarge
: mem of the industry- Along the line of these cor
rect business principles the transportation problem!
should- be easily adjustable. Production and trans
portation have such interests in common that there
is no natural disagreement between them, and what
ever friction exists must be artificial and curable, or
due to ignorance and removable by intelligent con
sideration. The former branch of the existing situa
tion opens up a vast field. The market takes fruit in
its fresh state, and canned and dried. Mr. William
H. Mills has brought back from Europe information
of an opening for another important form to which
the product may be reduced, as fruit pulp evaporated
to a semi-solid condition.
It may not be generally known that there is already
a large sale in localities in this country for these firm
jams, which require no glass or metal package. In |
New Orleans there is a large consumption of pine- i
apple and other evaporated fruit pulps, produced in
the West Indies, and there is imported into San I
Francisco from Mexico a large quantity of guava and
quince and other pulps, in bricks. This industry is
one of the primitive domestic arts of the Unite-i I
States. Old folks have not forgotten the delights of i
"apple butter," made on the farm and boiled down
until it concentrated all the delicious flavors of the
fruit Evaporate it more, so that it requires no ves
sel to hold it, but may be wrapped in oiled tissue and
packed and shipped in a box. and you have the fruit !
pulp, which Mr. Mills finds in demand all over Eu
rope.
It may be that this pulp can be made to take the
place of most of our dried fruits except prunes and
raisins. If any grower will visit a Mexican store in
this city and taste the Mexican pulps, with their
luxurious flavor, he >vill get a lesson in the possibili
ties of this method of preparation.
Commercially it will remove some of the risks that
attend the dried fruit industry. Unless dried fruits
are protected by sulphuring, or other expensive
processes, they are destroyed by parasites. In certaiu
of our markets there is objection to these processes.
But the semi-solid pulp is not attacked by any insect
and keeps in perfect condition in any climate. Its
production is simple and it can be carried on by the
fruit-grower independent of any combination.
The suggestion is worth the immediate attention of
aur planters. The State Horticultural Association.
now in session, is a body of distinguished men, They
are something more than mere planters, for in Cali
fornia horticulture ranks with the learned professions.
The State is fortunate that its great interest is in
such skillful hands-
THE FRUIT-GROWERS:
We presume that it is Mr. Farrell's object to tear
the mask from the face of the corporation and compel
it to acknowledge its fraud by raising its rates, since,
under the decision of the United States Supreme
Court, it can continue to fleece the people of Califor
nia by that process. In this way only can the liti
gation he has instituted succeed. A public proclama
tion of the fact that the express company intends to
continue its exactions even if it has to raise its rates
would, perhaps, -to some extent, satisfy those who
are compelled to patronize it.
That is to say, the highest court .in the land has
held that Wells, Fargo & Co," must pay the tax, but
that in doing so it may add to the amount of its regu
lar rates. In this State "the corporation has not
availed itself of this formal way of evading its share
of the Government burdens. It has persisted from
the first in demanding the stamps from its customers
and has made no change in its tariff rates.

be reasonable. "^Â¦Â¦f^.'r

Colonel Phllo Hersey of San Jose read
an interesting paper oft "The Advantages
of Co-operation From a Packer's Stand

operation had been demonstrated by expe

cent of the prune growers associated than
to have 90 per cent. Anything more than
10 per cent of the whole body outside of
the association might, like a fair sized
hornet, "be able to break up a large
prayer meeting."

read. One was by J. "W. Nelson on "From
Orchard to Table, From a Canner's Stand
point," and the other by Isidor Jacobs, on
"Future Trade Possibilities in Canned and
Dried Fruits."
Mrs. Emma Shafter Howard of Oakland
addressed the convention concerning
the work women have done and will do
for the upbuilding of the fruit Industry of
the State. She was warmly received and
the convention adopted resolutions intro
duced by William Johnston of Sacramen
to sftting forth that "the custom of hold
ing special meetings of bodies attending
our conventions will. In our opinion, ad
vance the popularity and usefulness of the
conventions, and we trust that they may
be successfully continued."
Following a report made by Edwin Ber
wick of Alonterey, chairman of the com
mittee on the mteroceanic canal, resolu
tions Introduced by Isidor Jacobs and
reading as follows were adopted:
Resolved, That the fruit growers of Califor
nia, in convention assembled, hereby urge upon
our representatives In Congress the Importance
to the State of immediate and favorable action
looking to the immediate construction of the
Nicaragua canal.
Resolved further. That the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce. State Board of Trade
and all kindred bodies interested In the welfare
of California and her Industries be asked to
call immediate meetings and forward petitions
to Congress urging Immediate and favorable
action.
The convention will continue In session
to-day and to-morrow afternoon.
The Idea which has been mooted for
many years of a union of all the fruit
men of California for their protection and^
common good may at last become an
actuality. The cured fruit men, the raisin
men, the citrus fruit men and the grow
ers of deciduous fruits, with their varied
interests, may be affiliated upon some
basis. The first step was taken yesterday
at the State convention of the fruit grow
ers in Pioneer Hall, where the appoint
ment of a committee of thirteen to con
sider the matter was authorized. M. Theo
Kearney of Fresno offered the motion. A.
H. Naftzger of the Southern California
Citrus Fruit Exchange seconded it. Many
fruit growers took part In a discussion
which led up to the decision. President
Cooper will name the committee upon the
reassembling of the fruit growers in con
vention this morning. There will be seven
growers of deciduous fruits and two for
each of the other interestsâ citrus fruits,
raisins and cured fruits. That was the
important act accomplished by the con
vention yesterday â the authorization of
such a move.
There were several features of the con
vention that were of more than usual in
terest. Judge II. G. Bond of San Jose,
president of the California Cured Fruit
Association, made a report. The Important
fact contained in this was that the associa
tion has absolute control of the production
of 90 per cent nt the prune producing
acreage of the State, or 55.S25 acres, for a
period of two years. Judge Bond said that
the prune growers had received for the
prunes they had disposed of double what
thev would had there been no association.
Onfy one-fourth of the prune crop has
been marketed. The association would
keep up the present prices, and, If neces
sary, would carry over the unsold portion
of the crop to another year.'
"Thoso prune growers who have held
aloof from the association only to take
advantage of thHr neighbors," said Judge
Bond, "are not entitled to the name of
good citizens and good neighbors," and
the convention applauded that sentiment.
Committee Is Authorized to Make
Plans for the Concerted Ac
tion of Large in
terests.

Track Notes.
After the poor showing made by Andrat
tus Trainer James Dyer was suspended by
the Judges pending an investigation of the
two-year-old's .race.
On Tuesday Morris Epplnger ran a
match into an electric light manufactory
and yesterday purchased Sad Sam from
Louis Ezell for $1500. His luck staid with
him.
Following ; are to-day's entries:

BY F. E. MTJIiHOLLAND.
ONE always regrets seeing a good
horse beaten, and those who bet
on. Golden Age to win the two
year-old handicap at Oakland yes
terday must have wept. 'He was
pounds and ounces the best, and then
finished second to Janice, a 3 to 1 chance
from the stable of Green Morris, that
carried heavy support. Some days ago.
In a cheap sort of a sprint, Coburn rode
Rolling Boer against a bunch of cheap
ones, and Sam. Hildreth told "Monk" not
to win too far off. Ever since that time
Coburn has been dealing out Rolling
Boer finishes. Yesterday, on pounds the
best horse, he tried to place his mount.
He succeeded, but when trying to get
through next 'the rail, was shut off and
finished second to Janice, the well-backed
one. Ii was one of the most stupid rides
ever witnessed at Oakland track, and It
is to , be ' hoped Coburn learned much by
his defeat. f
The track was again (lightning fast and
very fast time was made^ln the different
events. Three of six favorites carried
away purses. ; =
Walter Jennings, famous for turning
out warm ones from his stable, sent Van
tine in the opening event. The filly was
backed from 5 to 1 to 8 to 5, and won
easily from. Letiger. the opening favorite.
Tlng-a-Ling'. ran third.
Jimmy Coffey's Goldone was considered
the one real cinch of the day, and after
being backed at the close price of 9 to
10, fell easy . game to Dr. Bernays. The
doctor trudged along in fourth position to
the stretch, where he strided to the front
under O'Connor's urging, and won com
paratively easily. The favorite had noth
ing left to down but Wax for the place.
Johnny Schorr's horse Sea Lion appar
ently outclassed his company in the third
event, still the ring laid as good as 5 to
2 about the Deceiver horse. Tiburon gave
him a rub, but when Miller shook the
favorite up, he won hands down. Bessie
Lee snatched place honors from Tiburon.
The speedy Andrattus made a frightful
failure of capturing .the sprint for two
year-olds, decided under selling condi
tions. Wedderstrand had the leg up on
the youngster and he never looked danger
ous. â¢ Sad Sam -led from start to finish,
reaching the wire half a dozen lengths
before "Mef-ida, in record time for the dis
tance, 1:<.6. Satin Coat, a new arrival,
took the 'show.
â¢ Charley .Ellison, the blonde speculator
from -the- Middle West, plunged- on -his
horse Specific to win the closing mile run
and' cashed' his tickets. The bay colt was
plugged to 6 to 5 favoritism, and after
getting away from the nast none too well,
led Asian out at- the wire by two lengths
in 1:39?4. Vulcain took the show.
WATER FRONT DUELIST
IS GIVEN HIS LIBERTY
tThomaa Lawton Proves That He
Fired at Frank Woods in
Self -Defense.
Thomas Lawton, teamster, who fought
a bloodless duel with Frank Woods, boll-
er-maker, in Mallory's saloon on East
street last Saturday, appeared before
Judge Cabanlss yesterday on charges of
discharging firearms within the city lim
its and carrying a concealed weapon. The
Judge, after hearing- .the evidence, dis
missed both cases, as Lawton was not the
aggressor. Woods is wanted for an as
sault with a deadly weapon, but has not
yet been arrested.
Edward W. Challlot, 1103 Mission street.
was convicted by Judge Fritz yesterday
on a charge of battery upon his wife and
wlll*be sentenced to-day. Thanksgiving
morning he asked his wife for money for
drink. She told him she had only 50 cents
in the house, and refused to give him a
portion of It. He went out and got drunk
and. returning, gave her an unmerciful
beating. As he had threatened to kill her
the Judge instructed her to swear to a
complaint charging him with threats
against life.
The charge of obtaining money by falso
pretenses against L. W. Qaston was dis
missed by Judge Conlan yesterday. Gas
ton bought the Maine restaurant. 410
Kearny street, and gave in payment a
check for $1050, which was alleged to be
worthless. R. G. Wilkle. the complaining
witness, testified yesterday that the check
was good and a mistake had been made.
James Duffy, who struck William Daly
with a shovel in front of 119 San Carlos
avenue, was held to answer before the
Superior Court by Judge Conlan yester
day on a. charge of assault with a deadly
weapon In $100i> bonds.

W. Steelc and Engineer H. M. Tracy the
railroad oineialfc do not hesitate to de- |
clare, but whether there' are other em
ployes who should share some of the
blame is a matter that can be determined
only by a rigid Investigation. Most of
the railroad hands who were on ooard
the ill fated train and who escaped in
jury were summoned to attend an inquest
in Solano County, yesterday, so the exam
ination by Division Superintendent J.
Agler was deferred until to-day or to
morrow. There will be three difterent in
quests and the employes must attend all
of them. , ,.
Mr. Agler said yesterday that he would
examine the train crew as soon as an
opportunity afforded.
"I shall take the sworn statements of
Stcele and Tracy," said the superintend
ent, "and these, accompanied by my own
report, will be submitted to the general
manager. There s=eema to be no doubt
thai Steele blundered, but he will be
given every opportunity to clear himself."
Conductor Steele says he pulled out
from SuiÂ«un without waiting for the
freight to pass him, because the agent
at Hufsun told him that the freight was
four hours late, and he thought he had
ample time to make the run to Elmira.
General Manager Kruttschnitt said yes

MONEY MAY NOT
ESCHEAT TO THE
STATE TREASURY
an Heir of the Late
Joseph Sullivan.
Detective Morse Discovers
Through the efforts of Harry N.- Morse
detective, a legitimate heir of Joseph Sul
livan, the tailor, who died at the French
Hospitol ln May, 1809, has been found. He
is said to be in England and has given
proof positive that he is a relative of the
dead man. The small fortune which led
three men to commit crimes, which,
through the expose ln The Call, brought
them within the meshes of the law. will
not escheat to the State for want of an
heir. A letter received yesterday by. the
Morse Detective Agency in answer to an
advertisement published in the London
newspapers; is so conclusive that the At
torney General. has given up all hope of
turning the money Into the State's treas
ury. . .
This latest development in the now
famous case recalls the attempt to loot
this estate, the result of which was the
conviction of John M. Chretien of forgery,
the disgrace of James Taylor Rogers and
the trial now pending of Fred Hansted,
alias "Young DutcHy," on a charge of ut
tering a forged instrument.
In order that the money left by Sullivan
could be turned over to tho State it was
necessary for the Attorney- General to
show that there were -no heirs at law.- He
engaged Harry N. Morse to Investigate
the matter and the detective reported that
the better plan was to advertise in the
English- newspapers, the decedent having
been a native of England. The advertise
ment was placed in leading London papers
and in the course of time a number of
letters were received by Morse. The let
ter writers were unable to prove their re
lationship and it seemed almost certain
that the money would go to the State.
Yesterday, however, a missive arrived
from England, which not only proves the
writer's relationship, but shows beyond a
doubt that Joseph Sullivan, deceased, had
a relative who is entitled to the much
talked of estate. .

ATTORNEY EISNER QUESTIONING WITNESS AT SESSION OF THE INQUEST ON THE VICTIMS OF THE THANKSGIVING DAY CATASTRO
PHE. JUSTICE OF THE PEACE BARRY, PRESIDING FOR CORONER COLE, ASKS POINTED QUESTIONS CONCERNING EFFORTS TO KEEP THE
CROWD OFF THE PREMISES AND TO GIVE WARNING OF DANGER. â¢ â¢
It Is pleasant to read in "A Few Memo
ries" of Mme. de Navarro (.Miss Mary
Anderson) how every effort was made to
make a successful play of "Tt.e Winter's
Tale." Miss Anderson says that she fol
lowed the suggestion : of Thomas Hall
and played the two parts of Hermlone and
Perdita, thus keeping alive an unbroken
Interest in the mother and child, who
have, been separated " for the best part of
two acts by the plan of the dramatist.
Success crowned her efforts. I never
heard more enthusiasm expressed within
the walls of a theater than during the
last week ' of Miss Anderson's perform
ance at the. Lyceum. When a Lyceum au
dience shouts "Mary. Mary.", and- de
mands a "speech" one may be sure thit
the Englishman feels something and must
give utterance to it. It was a triumph
CROTCAIi ESTnvr.ATE OP THE
PLAY.
Looks on all alike. T-'ffP'^-
She looks pleadingly at . Floriael. who
says no sustaining word, and begs him
for his sake be gone. There is no thought
of reproach because he has raised imprac
ticable expectations and sported with her
feelings. He is the heir apparent, and his
rights with her are paramount. She Is as
sailed cruelly by her father, but she does
not retort angrily or weep hot tears or
show one look of indignation at this slan
der. But his injustice helps her see the
path before her. Cast off by her father,
she must flee with the prince, whom Ca
millo sustains in his disloyalty. So she
will go to Sicily as the friendless maid tor
whom a crown prince risks the loss of a
throne. But she thinks no evil, and goes
forward knowing the power there is in
her to enact and exact the right. And
Florizel's whim of having her arrayed in
the robes of a court lady prepares her for
a fitting entry into her father's. capital.
We do not seePerdita much again. Her
mother is restored to the play, and she
must assume a secondary role. W e could
have been sure that Shakespeare would
bring the daughter and her mother to
gether ln an artistic subordination that
should be glorifying to them both. It is
a beautiful moment when this country
maid, who has never seen paintings or
statues or cunning handiwork before,
kneels before Hermlone in Paulinas be
wildering gallery. What Influences, tel
epathic or other, draw her Shakespeare
does not reveal and maybe does not pre
tend to know. But he has convinced us
that she'could not have knelt to a paint
ed image of cold stone, yet cannot 'but
kneel to the real presence of the Queen,
Â¦who bore her in Imprisonment, sorrow and
desolation. â¢ . L. U. SHERMAN.

~ With such a mind, such vision. Perdlta
wins her way with the group about her
and with ourselves. Then in due course,
comes the moment when the author, using
Pollxenes' weak and petulant teraPff to
turn the plot and give the lovers a chance
of escape, makes him accuse her -of hay
in tr with purpose and knowledge bewitched
the prince and threaten to efface her
beauty. But there Is no anger and no
confusion:
I was not much af eared. For once or twice
I was about to speak and tell him plainly
The selfsame sun that nhines upon hts court
HM*s*not his vlsase from our cottage, but
(Concluded.)
"When Leontes first essayed to match
himself against the majesty of Hermione's
mind. In the first scene: In the last act, he
was put quickly to confusion. Now, sim
ilarly, he Is demoralized and abashed. Ho
forgets the dignity of the court, with
which he has tried to fortify himself; he
abandons his official role and descends to
domestic scolding. 'Hermione does not
disdain to reply to him, for his sake, upon
this plane. . He has no recourse but to
make new charges and declare .that her
doom is fixed already. This stirs no re
calcitrant feeling, though something very
different springs up In her heart:
Blr, inre your threats;
The bue which you -would fright me with I
seek.
To me can life be no commodity.
The crown and comfort of my life, your favor.
I do Blve lost, for I do feel it gone.
But know not how It went.
That- her affection for him is not extin
guished In spite of all he has done to for
feit It, that she misses It and longs for It
even at this moment, Is sublimely pa
thetic, and shows the measure or her
character and devotion. -
There have been wide departures here
from the treatment employed In "Cymbe
line." In that play Imogen conquers by
Influences of innocence and meekness that
go out from her personality. Hermione
conquers by far more and potent forces.
Imogen's wifely spirit was ruffled, for the
moment, at the Injustice and indirection
of her husband's order. Hermione resists
not the intended evil by so much as a
frown. Immediately the attack upon her
Is changed to a defense against her. The
assailant seems vanquished, disarmed, hu
miliated. We do not much understand the
psychology of such a rout; there have nut
been examples enough for study. It is
evident enough that evil, when unresisted,
as here, for the sake of the one attempt
ing to inflict it, recoils upon the adver
sary's head. '"Â¦<'
It is Interesting to compere the daugh
ter, so far as she has been developed to
us, with her mother. Perdita is not so
stalwart and self-poised; there Is less of
the true and more of beauty in her na
ture. She stands between Hermione ana
Imogen. She has grown up in a shep
herd's cottage, without knowledge of the
world and unsuspecting that she is of
gentle birth. Florizel, son of King Pollx
enes, following his falcon across her sup
posed father's lands, now greatly broad
ened by her treasure, chances to see her

great "landholder, under the name of r>p

opening of scene 4 In the fourth act, in a
shepherd's frock put on over his court
dress, while he has persuaded Perdita to
don a gown and finery brought from the
palace. She has arrayed herself in the
costly clothing to please her lover, caring
nothing for the elegance and sorry to out
shine the neighbor farm girls and swains
who are to be her guests.
It is Perdita's part to be mistress of the
festival in her dead mother's place; and
Shakespeare has wished us to eee a
queen's child rise to her true plane by na
tive nobleness, and without Instruction, in
a shepherd's cottage. So he has constitu
ted her wooer capable of the whim of
robing her as queen indeed. Florizel is
made in turn to have put on shepherd a

themselves as of the company and are

Heroines of "The Winter's Tale."
for Miss Anderson and a greater triumph
for Shakespeare. Would that all those .
older critics could have witnessed such an
Ideal rendering ot Shakespeare's last play.
The beauty and grace with which MUs
Anderson as the shepherdess Perdita led
the long dance of the s>Iiepherd3 and shep
herdesses, tho picturesque and lovely ap
pearance she presented in the stattto
scene, leave two pictures upon the mem
ory that can never be effaced and readily
make us believe that Shakespeare never
created two scenes more potentially po
etical and spectacularly fascinating.
Traditionally "The Winter's Tale" has
not been a successful play. The romantic
story of Greene, probably one of the mo3t
popular of Greene's many novels, is the
source of this rtrnma. And in thi3 play
perhaps more than in all hia other adap
tations the dramatist seems to fail to in
sert all the detaiU and logical sequences
provided for the reader by the novelist,
bu,t ' apparently disregaided, toy the play
wi^ght. Greene, the writer of plays an"1
novels, looked upon Shakespeare as a pla
giarist. He Is supposed to have had
Shakespeare ln mind when he accused
some dramatists of being "beautified with,
our feathers." How Greene would havo
enjoyed Shakespeare's last pluck out of
hia plumage.
True it is. as Mr. Frederick S. Boas
writes, "The unfortunate 'Roberto'
(Greene) >as not, however, gone quite un
avenged. His story, in spite of its great
popularity with the reading public, waa
in many, respects a daranosa hereditas to
a dramatist, and even Shakespeare
could not transform it into a play with
unity of motive or of action." Shakes
peare did more than take Greene's
"feathers." He made a choice of the
same. Not only did he change* the title
of the story, which was known as "Pan
dosto; or Dorastus and Faunia," but ho
also materially altered the character of
the tale. In Greene's story Eglstus,
King of Sicily, visits Pandosto, King of
Bohemia. Pandosto's love for hia royal
guest suddenly becomes metamorphosed
Into a raging Jealousy of both his guest
and his own wife, Bellarta, The Innocent
wife succumbs to the shock, but Egi3tus
escapes from the Jealous madman. Not
satisfied with the murder of his wife the
tyrant Pandosto now exposes her babe
Faunia, the coming heroine of the tale,
to the mercy of the elements. The child
drifts on the seas to the coast of Slcilia
and is there rescued by the shepherds.
| The life of the princess shepherdess
glides gently on until the princely son of
Eglstus Is made to cross it by happy
chance. This Prince Dorastus falls in
love with the shepherdess and elopes with
her on board a ship. This was all con
trary to the plan3 of the father Egistus.
who had arranged a marriage with a
Danish Princess for him. Destiny, how
ever, seemed to oppose this fatherly
scheme. On board this same storm-tossed
ship was the wily shepherd who had in
his possession the trinkets needful to
prove the royal lineage of the rustic
Faunia. It was a storm that drove this
shipload of fateful people upon the coast
of Bohemia, for Greene's Bohemia also
has a seashore, and it was a stormy, pas
sionate conclusion that that writer gave
to his story. Pandosto unwittingly falls
in love with his own daughter and upon
discovering this error he becomes melan
choly and finally commits suicide.
From, this brief and imperfect account
It will be noticed that the dramatist's
story differs very greatly and fundament
ally from that of the novelist. The very
names of the characters are changed, and
the names of the two countries, Sicily and
Eohemia, are Interchanged. Shakes
peare adds the characters of Antlgonus,
Paulina, Autolycus and the clown. Trac
ing the plot of the tale, one will note that
Shakespeare keeps fairly close to the ac
count of the novelist, drifting awav only
now and then during the first three acts.
As Mr. Wendell has observed. "The first
three acts make a complete independent
tragedy, involving the deaths of Mamil
lius and Antigonui". and, so far as you can
tell for the moment, the still more tragic
end of Hermlone."
One very noticeable point attacked by
critics ln this part of Shakespeare's work
.is the slight motivation given to the ab
normally jealous passion of I/eontes.
Greene's novel informs us of the growing
intimacy between Egistus and Bellaria.
while Pandosto was absorbed in -the af
fairs of state. Such a mere trifle it seems
to be that throws Leontes into this vio
lent madness. We are not dealing now
with a Posthumus or an Othello.- Her
mione urges Polixenes to prolong his visit
at the court of Leonteg. and this. too. at
the request of Leontes. Suspicion sud
denly enters the mind of leontes, and
Shakespeare lets It grow Into a monster
of jealousy, until Leontes brings his no
ble queen to trial before her own court
all in vain. The king Is blind with pas
sion.
The most striking differences between
the novel and the drama are to be traced
in the fourth and fifth acts. Here again,
to quote Mr. Wendell. "The last two acts
make a complete Independent comedy
which, taking up the story at Its moat
tragic point, leads to a final denouement
of reconciliation and romantic serenity.'"
This play, then, falls Into two parts, parts
of a very different character. One now
understands -why the Interest in the plot
and characters is so hard to sustain, and
how* happy was the Jdea. to have Miss
Anderson combine thesei two characters,
mother and daughter. As Greene's story
runs, the interest of the reader Is sus
tained by the love episode In which Do
rastus and Faunia are the leading play
er?. In the novel the first part of the plot
seems a mere Introduction to this love ro
mance of "Faunia. While with the play
we are delighted only for a time, in tha
fourth act. with the fascinating Move
scenes between Perdita and 'Florlzel.
Charmed with the grace and simplicity of
Perdita. the listener is still conscious that
she is not merely to be seen and enjoyed
but for her is destined a greater part in
the plot. She Is to be rescued and to soft
en the sadness of her mother's wrongs.
Were it not for this fourth act the play
would be somber enough. And it is the
idyllic beauty, the sweet and simple pas
toralism, the Joyous and rustic merry
makings of the sheep-shearing feast, the
presence of the dancing and piping shep
herds and flhepherde^^a, the surround
ings of Arcadian woodland and fiower
land. It is all these that transport us back:
to the scenes of "As You Like It," to the-
English Faeryland of Shakespeare. It
may be a fancy, but it is a pleasing farifcy,
to associate these last scenes of the great
dramatist's last play with the Arden of
his beloved "Warwickshire: to think of the

In answer to another question Mr. Davis

"I did not. I had til I could do to keep

that hÂ» saw fully men and boys climb

NEVT YORK, Dec 5.â To-day's market Fcrae-
Ti-hat reversed the epeculatlve position of yes
tf-rday. The early part of the day eho\*ed a
continuance of the reactionary teauency. Lon-
Oon took its cue from the depreeslou here yte
terd&y and sold the Americans, offenass from
that source antountlr.g to some â¢O.joO **uirw.

ciunni: ti <â¢ course of the day that thÂ»Â»-Â»Â» Â«aa
11c urgent pressure to liquidate. Tuc decline
in pnat brought no large offerings and the
bears' v.trt disinclined on this Account to j.ur
i-'.'.c tt cir campaign. Consequently, they tiought
to coiei their contracts and turned the market
uyvsrd. The recovery was helped by strenyth
in a few etocks, but whether the upward
course of prices late In the day was due gen
rraJly to any other cause than the taking ff
l>ear profits on the short sales which were In
vited by yesterday's weakness remain* to be
(*en. The developments in the money market,
which is the true index of speculation at pres
ent, continue against the presumption for ac
tive eD'cLlation. Call money rates went tc
t Der cent to-day and .the movement of cur
rency to the interior continues una.bated. To
day t2lH..,(x.O wa* transferred through the Sub-
Treasury to Chicago and $275,000 to New Or
leans. This rate of depletion Is far too large
to penr.lt of any extensive credit expansion by
New York financial Institutions and would not
require a long continuance to force a sharp
contraction 01 loans. It will be remembered
that In the period of repression proceeding the
election bankers were practically unanimous
in the opinion that resources mutt be conserve.!
for'the enlarged requirements of business after
election. The outpouring of credits after elec
tion, however, was on such a large scale as
to ' overwhelm all demands and force, an eÂ«isv
money rate, izi ppite of the furious (-peculation
â¢which raced for several weeks. In to-day's
market Atchipon preferred and Missouri Pacific
were strong: and Brooklyn Transit and the steel
Ftock* were in demand. Sugar was very feve-
lsh ar.d after rallying from early weakness to
aiKjut a point over last night, it lost the gain
again In a few minutes. The Amalgamated
Copper fchares had an extreme decline of 4U
before showing &ny resistance, but they strong
ly recovered over half the Iokb.

FORECAST.
CHICAGO, Dec. 6.â At the beginning of trade
the wheat market was treated to surprise by
an advance at Paris equal to 1%@2%c. Liver
pool was also higher. There was a fair outside
demand and a disposition on the part of the
local shorts to cover. January opened %c higher
at 71T4f72c, and during the first hour sold to
72HS72V4C. On the bulge the outside demand
fell off and the trade which had been fairly
active became quiet and professional. A de
sire for profits on the part of longs, who were
Influenced by the continued liberal receipt? re
sulted in a decline to 71Hc Here the market
steadied and January closed %c up at 71'4
671*4 c.
Corn was very strong early chiefly because
of a. fear of a squeeze in the December deliv
ery under the same management that made
success of the November deal. Of the 214 cars
received to-day but one was of graded contract.
This so impressed shorts that December, which
opened *4@Hc higher at 37VÂ»JT37 1 -4c. rallied
fharply to 2Sc. Here Phillips let out 400,000
bushels purchased yesterday and relieved the
tension. The close was strong, %c up at 37%c.
May was influenced considerably by wheat,
closing a shade lower at 36%@36%c.
Oats were exceptionally "dull. May closed
unchanged at 23%c.
Provisions opened strong on light hog re
ceipts and higher prices at the yards. Follow
ing this the market ruled easier for a time
under the belief that a leading bull was selling
December lard. Later a demand for lard by
this bull resulted in covering by shorts and a
rally ensued. January pork closed 20c higher
lard JOc up and ribs 7%c Improved.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
" Including the Oregon ducks mentioned yes
terday there were about 140 sacks of Game on
the market, and as the â¢ demand was mod
erate, low prices still ruled. .

Mall advices from New York Bay:
"On the whole, the holiday buying for the
year up to date has been rather a dlsappoint
rr.ent. The warm weather is chiefly responsi
tole. without doubt, and high prices and election
contributed largely to the elownees. Consump
tive dezr.atd has picked up considerably in the
past two weeks, however.
"Walnuts of all ascriptions are hard to find.
Grcnobles and Naples lead in point of scarcity.
There were practically none on the spot on
Wednesday. Arrivals by recent steamers have
been only triSing. Filberts continue in good
demand, and art firm at ll'vc. Some almonds
are gelling at concessions. Mixed nuts are in
very pood demand at l'Hi.e. The trade In mixed
nuts has lieen particularly good this fall.
"Prunes are going out quite well. 60-70S and
SK'-IOC* being the sizes ciwl Â¦wanted. Oregrons
tre in fair request. There twins to be a little
letter sentiment in raisins, due to the reports
from the coart that the association has been
buying outside poods there. Fancy raisins,
2dalaÂ£&a e*i>ecia!ly. have been In very good de
r..ir..-J during the past few days. Fancy Smyrna
ft^s are moving out fairly well and there is
eome little inquiry for California tigs, which
are scarce on the epot. A fair business is re
ported In 3-crown in cartons at 60c to arrive.
Some trade is reported in unpeeled peaches.
Apricots and pears are quiet. Dates continue
in pood demand, and the market is firm.
Evaporated an>les are weaker, prime on Wed
nesday being quoted at r.^^ 1 ,. Waste is firm."

NEW YORK. Dec. 5 â ThÂ« Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram Kays:
The markets here were irregular and drooping
to-day. Paris again sold Tlntos freely, but
apparently recent reports of trouble were base
lets, the selling being due simply to profit
taking at the end, of the year and bearing
pressure of General Mercier's foolish talk
about invasion of England. London absorbed
the Paris Fales of Tlntos and Anacondas and
held the prl<* fairly firm. Americans were
neglected and heavy. London bought Erics
and Atchison, but New York discouraged an
advance and the close was at the worst. The
announcement of an isfue of treasury bills for
Â£2.000.000 hardened discounts. Money rates
unchanged. Paris exchange 25. 10.

of a bomb in Saunders' Theater 'at Har
vard this morning, while Dr. Algernon C.
Coolidge was conducting one of his his
tory lectures, was the culminating event
in a long eerles of petty persecutions to
which Dr. Coolidge has been subjected for
several years past.
It was said In Cambridge this afternoon
that Professor Coolidge is the victim of
a concerted plot. . Dr. Coolidge Is a mem
ber of the famous and aristocratic Cool
idge family. When Jefferson Coolidge.
the uncle of. Dr. CoolldE-e, waa American
Minister to St. Petersburg, the present
Harvard professor was an official at the
American Legation at that capital and
stood In very cordial relations with the
nobility And the Government officials. At
that time he was so consplculously a
friend of the bureaucracy that he Incurred
the cordial dislike of the Russian liberals
or Nihilists. A number of threatening
letters have been received by Dr. Coolidge
and undoubtedly come from Nihilists or
Nihilist sympathizers.

societies sent an immense floral cross and
the officers connected with the various
posts in and around the harbor sent im

Chaplain Joseph Potter, after which the
casket was borne to the waiting caisson
by six non-commissioned officers and
taken to the ferry for shipment to Wash
ington. Two troops of cavalry escorted
the remains, which were followed by a
number of carriages containing army offi

Professor Babcock's '.em arks were
chiefly directed to prove that municipal
ownership of public utilities would result
in cheaper rates to the consumer.
"Munvtpal ownership has come to'stay,"
said Professor Babcock, "and all that
must be determined is how far shall we
go in the matter. New York, Boston, De
troit and Baltimore have all tried munici
pal ownership with success, and San
Francisco -has proven Itself wise, far
sighted and well guarded in declaring in
Its charter for the ultimate acquisition
of the great public utilities."
"With due deference to the new char
ter," said Frank J. Symmes, the first
speaker of the negative, "I do not know
but that this city is better off now, than
if it were to fake up the great responsi
bilities of municipal ownership. Acqui
sition of public utilities by the city is only
possible if it can be demonstrated that
through k can be furnished better and
cheaper service In street railways, tele
phones and water systems, than by pri
vate corporations. It is results that we
are after, not methods. We must not be
misled by what has been successfully
done In London, Glasgow or Kalamazoo.
(Laughter.) Some one has said that the
city would save $180,000 In taxes If this
city should acquire the Spring Valley
water plant. But it is forgotten that that
sum must be replaced by an equivalent
amount from increased taxation on other
property. We must be fair and Just to
capital as well -as to the people. San
Francisco must not drive capital away.
(Applause.)
"Municipal ownership can best be post
poned, for what the city needs more than
that is better Bchools and streets. It
needs a new quarantine officer. (Long
continued applause and cries of "That's
right,") If I nad my way I would borrow
$100,000,000 fr.om Claus Spreckels (laugh
ter) and spend $5,000,000 on our city front.
(Applause.; The rest of the money I would
utilize in making this the best city in the
vorld, so that Its population and business
would double in twenty years." (Contin
ued applause and cheers.)
"Sacramento has successfully under
taken the responsibility of owning its own
water system," said Colonel Henry Weln
stock, who spoke ' for' the affirmative.
"The consumers there have to pay Just
one-half what, is paid in this city. It is
true that socialists advocate the munici
pal ownership of public utilities, but It is
not true that all those who advocate it
are socialists. Municipal ownership. It
nan been said, would destroy competition
and lead to public monopoly. Let us be
grateful that the way to monopoly in this
country is very hard and let us hope that
it will be harder. There is a distinction
between private and public monopoly. In
private monopoly the public* is helpless,
but In public monopoly the public has
methods of redress at its command. .
Â¦ "The most serious objection raised to
municipal ownership is the increased ex
pense Incident thereto. It Is true that no
cities are eo extravagantly governed and
give less to' their people than American
cities. This deplorable fact seems an ir
refutable argument against the acquisi
tion of the utilities. But I see an impor
tant step In political progress by the in
troduction of the Australian ballot : law,
purity of election law and . civil service
law. It Is simply a question of putting
the right men in the right places and. the
objection stated will disappear. The po
litical indifference of Kb better citizenship
is the. country'* greatest menace. (Ap
plause.) There is but one escape from pri
vate monopoly, arid that is public owner
ship, which will bring about the highest
and best municipal government."
E. A. Ross, late head professor of eco
nomics and social science in Stanford Uni
versity, was greeted with great applause
when he rose ' to close for .â¢ the negative
side of the question. . 'Â¦*
-."The true goal of municipal regulation,",
said Prof essor Ross, "is . the exacting, of
such terms for, the franchise as will shear
The inviUci gruests to the number of 4S5
gathered In the parlor as early as 6:30 and i
shortly afterward, headed by F. W. Dohr
mann, president of the Merchants' Asso
ciation, proceeded to the banquet hall.
The feast was presided over by Mr. E>ohr
mann; who with the honored guests oc
cupied a special tabLe on the elevated,
platform. On Mr. Dohrmann's Immediate
right sat Claus Sprockets with Professor
Benjamin Ide Wheeler, Frank J. Symmes.
Professor E. A. Koss and Dr. D. W. Mont
gomery. On his left were Mayor Phelan,
Colonel H Welnstock. Professor David
Starr Jordan and Professor" K. C. Bab
cock k
The other guests were seated at a
score of tables running parallel, which
were gaily .adorned here and there with
choice cut flowers interwoven with gar
lands of smilax. Men prominent in the
educational, forensic anil business world,
to whoee efforts much of the success at
tained by this Western metropolis is due. â¢
were gathered In friendly intercourse, and !
good humor i reyaiied throughout the en
tire evening. Men forgot for the moment
cares and worries and lent themselves to
a thorough enjoyment of the good things,
material and intellectual, that had been
provided for their delectation.
When Mr. Dohrrrann rose to make the
opening remarks just about the time cof
fee was served, he was greeted with
hearty applause. After a facetious al
lusion to the Intellectual treat In store for
the assembled guests after he had con
cluded. Mr. Dohrnr.ann outlined the work
accomplished by the association during
th<Â» lapt yar. He referred to its efforts
in behalf of the Texas sufferers, which
resulted In a contribution from this State
of $!3 0-X).
"The mission of the Merchants' Associa
tion." said Mr. Dohrmann, "Is to make
this citv ideal; to make our streets and
public buildings perfect. We owe our
gratitude to a Sharon, a Huntlngton. a
Sweeney. & Crocker and a Donahue for
the many beautiful fctructures In our
beautiful Golden Gate Park. We fcwe our
thanks to Mrs. Stanford (applause) and
Mrs. Hearst for their substantial dona
tions to the cause of education as exem
plified in our two institutions. We arÂ«
deeply Rrateful to the gift of that magni
ficent Temple of Music madÂ«? to the city
by one of our foremost citizens, Claus
Spreckels, who Is our honored guest this
evening."
At this point the gursts rose to their
feet and cheered for several minutes.
Napkins were waved until Mr. Spreckels
was obliged to say a few words or thanks
for the tribute paid him.
' "We also owe our thanks to the pres3,"
continued Mr. Dohrmann, "for its aid In,
our efforts for the welfare of this commu
nity. I must confess that we are too pop
ula'r at the City Hall. I have noticed that
when the Supervisor? desire to solve nonw
knotty question, for Instance to vote
money for street paving when there Is
no money available, they refer the matter
i to the Merchants' Association. In the
I language of the day they 'pass the buck'
to us. Coming to the subject of the new
charterâ while we must acknowledge thai
it has its defects and shortcomings it is
much better than the previous organic
law which governed the city. The civil
service section is Intended to put the
municipal government on a business, not
a political, plane.
"In introducing the subject for discu-*
j Blon, 'The Advisability of Municipal
! Ownership and Operation of Public UtUi
j tirs.' I desire to state tliat we have pitted
1 against each other a professor of each of
our great universities, but it Is to be un
derstood that it is in no sense a debate
between the two institutions of learning.
I take pleasure now in Introducing K.
I C. Hancock, professor of hlston' and polit
ical science in the University of Califor
nia, who will speak on the iUflrraativ*
side of the question.
The third annual dinner of the Mer
chants' Association was held lust night
in the muin dining room of the Palace
Hotel and the affair excelled the previous
ones both in point of numbers that at
tended and the enthusiasm displayed.
Besides the enjoyment of a splendid menu
got up in the best style, the guests were
regaled with the beat thought of several
wo.'l known educators and men versed In
business affairs.

It is a wonderful soap
that takes hold quick and
does no harm.
No harm ! It leaves the
skin soft like a baby's; no
alkali in it, nothing but
soap. The harm is done by
alkali. Still more harm is
done by not washing. So,
bad soap is better than
none.
What is bad soap? Im-

Ing excellent business this week at thÂ©
Columbia Theater. It is the first presenta

price.
The Tivoll has a good drawing card In

Of "Madame Butterfly." now playing at
the Alcazar Theater. Alan Dale, the cele
brated New Tork critic, says: *' 'Madams
Butterfly' Is a gem. and I advise every
body to go and see It. Those who miss it
are depriving themselves of a great
treat." The play has created the right
kind of sensation, and as given at the Al
cazar Is thoroughly pleasing.
The Grand Opera-house presents the
Oliver-Leslie Company this week In "The-
Prisoner of Zenda." given here for thÂ»
first time at popular prices. The play has
made a hit.
Haverly's Mastodon Minstrels are still
amusing large audiences at the California.
Theater. .The last matinee will be given
on Saturday, and on Sunday afternoon "A
Bell Boy," the latest Eastern farco
comedy success, will begin a week's en
gagement. The company includes many
well known singers:, dancers and comedi
ans and a lot of pretty girls.

Water Front Notes.
There was . a short and .unimportant
meeting of the Harbor Commission yes
terday. After the board adjourned the
members went In a body to the reception,
on the new steamer Sierra and spent an
hour looking over that handsome vessel.
Balfour, Guthrle & Co. asked for one
of the new wharves to be erected be
tween Union and Lombard streets. The
matter was taken under advisement.
The Pacific Steam Navigation Company
asked for berths for Its vessels. The
concern expects to ; start opposition to
the Pacific Mail at once and expects its
first boat here on December 26. The
Commissioners told the representative of
the company that wharf room would be
provided for its boat as soon as they
made port. Â¦)
The Pullman Company was - given two
rooms opening: into .the- grand nave at a

Harbor Commissioners Meet.
Garth Wick, steward's st<}rekeeper on
the United States transport Thomas, is
In a very bad box. He Is accused of
smuggling whisky aboard the vessel and
selling it to the -soldiers. Liquor for
which he paid 60 cents a bottle he charged
$2 and during the past few months has
been acquiring a bank account. He is
now locked up in the ship's brig, how
ever, and it will probably take all his
money to , pay attorneys.
Wick's scheme was discovered by acci
dent. Over the lower storeroom Is a
prison and In this twenty-four men were
confined when the Thomas left Manila.
A small trap door leads Into the store
room and this Is secured with a padlock,
the only key to which was kept by Wick.
One of the prisoners spent three clays
working with a piece of wire and finally
picked the lock. The whisky was brought
to light and four hours later there was
not a sober prisoner in the "brig." Then
there were free fights galore and when
the guard was called in one of the drunks
ran against a bayonet and had to be sent
to the hospital. k
An Investigation soon revealed the
cache and Wick was placed under arrest.
From i what can be . learned it appears
that he brought the whisky down to the
ship labeled "ship's stores" In tomato
cases, In boxes marked "preserved
peaches" and again as "canned salmon."
Â¦ As such - it was put aboard and Wick at
once took â¢ charge of it. He will now
have to answer in the United States Fed
eral court for his breach of the law.
Trouble on the Thomas.
William Lowe, who came home from the
Arctic on the steam whaler Baelena. has
been missing for over a fortnight, and his
friends fear he is drowned. He was "paid
off" with a big sum of money by the P,a
ciflc Steam Whaling Company, and being
a first-class whaleman was at once
"signed on" again as third mate of the
steam whaler Grampus. From that day
to this Lowe has neither been seen nor
heard from. Some of his friends think he
has been ahanghaicd. some think. h<f was
murdered, robbed and his body thrown
overboard, while many more think he got
drunk and walked .overboard while look
ing for his ship. The general opinion is
that Lowe is dead and that the Grampus
will have to secure a new third mate.
Have Lost His Life.

THE American ship Alex Gibson,
Â¦with Captain Holmes in command,
is once more'ln port. The run was
a long one and the old-time mas
ter mariner is disgusted. No man
afloat has made more voyages around the
Horn than Captain Holmes, and this
ranks as one of his longest.
The Alex Gibson left New York on July
1, and on the Fourth all hands celebrated.
From that on a series of light winds and
calms was encountered and at times no
headway was- made. For a fortnight the
ship did not average two knots an hour,
and then, during the only heavy blow of
the voyage, there was a fatality.
On September 7 S. H. Erickson fell over
board from the mizzen* topsail yard. He
fell clear of tho ship and a life line was
thrown him. He caught the rope and held
on. His shipmates attempted to haul him
in, but the ship was racing through the
water, and before the yards could be
thrown aback and>*The headway stopped
the unfortunate man- had let go his hold
on the life line and was lost.
As soon as the Alex Gibson was hove to
a boat was lowered, but no trace of the
missing man could be found. He was a
native of Finland and 50 years of age
Captain Holmes Is away past the three
score-and-ten limit, but still he is as hale
and hearty as any sailor In port, and it
was only a few years ago that he took
unto himself a wife.

NEW; YORK, Dec. 5.â On the outskirts
of New York City a colony of Boers is to
be established. Seventy families, who
have resolved not to live under the British
flagr, are to form a settlement between
Hicksville and Syoaset in Nassau County,
and apply to the rich farm lands there
the Industry that has enabled them to
win sustenance from the, barren African
veldt. This project is backed not alone
by Americans, but English capital. " IU
principal support,' however, comes from
the Boer refugee aid committee, com
posed chiefly of members of old Dutch
families in . America who have relatives
among: the Boer fighting men and officials.
A tract .of land which will permit the
allotment or from five to twenty-five acres
to each of the seventy families has been
purchased by the -committee. â¢The' first
members of the colony expected to
arrive here on December 23, coming by
way of Delagoa Bay and Marseilles. They
will be followed soon by others. Repre
sentatives of the executive committee of
the aid committee will taken them in
charge and provide for them for the win
ter. Some of them have money, but those
who lack- it will be supplied with funds
for the purchase of agricultural imple
ments, building material, horses, cows
and chickens. Mortgages repayable by
easy Installments are to secure the com
mittee apainst loss. The services of a
Long Island farmer have been obtained
and he will furnish settlers with hints as
to methods of getting the best returns
from their land. The affairs of the colony
for the time being will be under the con
trol of the executive committee. - Descend
ants of old Dutch settlers in Long Island
are expected to give practical proof of
their interest in the project.

His refusal to obey an order directing him
to pay his former wife, Florence L. Deu

stated. He obeyed the order under con

He then refused to pay furt"her alimony
and was cited for contempt. He filed a
novel brief in his own defense and set up
the. plea that as he was an officer of the
court he could not be In contemot Sec

of his salary of $300 a month for the sup

ps"T|-5^HE Oceanic Steamship Company's
j 1 new palatial steamer Sierra was
I thrown open for inspection yester
1L day. For three hours the invited
guests came and went, and on
every lip Â¦was praise for the handsome
mall boat.
When the Sierra arrived here from Phil
adelphia the was at once docked at Pa
ciflc street. There she was looked over by
the "wise men" on the front and pro
nounced "good." Then she was taken up
to the sugar refinery and lay there while
the Zealandla -and Australia came and
Â¦went. Early yesterday morning she came
back to her berth and will remain there
until she sails next Wednesday for Syd
ney, N. S. W., via Honolulu, H. I.; Pago
Pago, Samoa, and Auckland, N. Z.
All the visitors to the Sierra yesterday
were received by John D. Spreckels, pres
ident of the Oceanic Steamship Company.
Among those who looked the vessel over
were many men well known in business
circles and also a smattering of poli
ticians. Harbor Commissioners Kilburn.
Harney and Herold and Secretary English
were there and were loud, in their praises
of the new ship. ' .
Among the prominent guests who in-
Epected the Sierra with a critical eye was
Claus Spreckels. He went over the big
liner from stem to stern and suggested
here and there an alteration that will im
prove the comfort of the traveling public.
In the staterooms, saloon and dining
room of the Sierra there is every com
fort, and all that man can desire while at
sea will be found aboard.
In the second cabin the quarters are
luxurious, and many a first-class steamer
that comes into San Francisco does not
show as good accommodations in her first
class quarters, while in the steerage every
arrangement has been made for the com
fort of those who will travel In that part
of the ship. , _ .
All the staterooms on the Sierra open
into the saloon and dining-room. - None of
them open on deck. There will In conse
quence be no flooding of rooms when a big
sea breaks aboard. The steamer stands
well out of the water, however, and has
proved herself to be a fast and weatherly
ship, so it will have to be a big sea that
will break over her bow.
Standing high In the water, It was neces
sary to have a companion way by which
passengers could reach the upper deck of
the vessel from the wharf without any ln
convenience. Captain Howard, superin
tendent of the Oceanic Company, solved
the problem by having a movable staging
built. This consists of two short flights
of steps of easy gradient, and once on top
the passenger walks along the regular

OX THE FINE NEW AUSTRALIAN MAIL STEAMSHIP SIERRA DURING THE RECEPTION ON BOARD TESTER
DAY. THE OFFICERS OF THE OCEANIC STEAMSHIP COMPANY WERE ALL PRESENT AND SHOWED
THE GUESTS OVER THE HANDSOME VESSEL.
All the other witnesses were shown
the pin. but none had seen it before the
first trial. It was found behind the door
of the room adjoining that in which Mrs.
ClutP was killed. -V
S. B. McGKnigran, an employe of the
electric roads, was the only other witness.
He had occupied the whole house at 803
Guerrero street for three years preceding
June of 1S37. He was the last tenant be
fore the izpptr story was taken by Mrs.
Clute. He was shown the coupling pin
End he swore ho had not had such an in-'
ftrument in the house and that it could
not have been there, for before he left
the house for the last time he Inspected
every room on purpose to see If anything
had been left behind.
C. W. Mark was called as a witness
parly in the afternoon. He amplified the
Ftories of Mrs. Legg and Mr. Legg as to
how he was met at the telephone.
After going upstairs and seeing the man
there. Mrs. Legg says she ran aown, call
ing to her father-in-law as she went, but
i_t she went down she heard the man
come from the front room and she stopped
to listen. He came down the uppei hall
to the back stairway, down the back
stairway io the back door, unlocked and
unlatched the back door, and she heard
him step on the board walk of the yard
coming down the alley to the gate. She
heard him open the gate and then she
ioined her father-in-law on the front steps
to watch for the man who came out He
Â«as Hotf's build, she Said, he wore clothes
like Hoff. he carried a bag oÂ£ tools simi
lar to the one Hoff had brought into the
{louse and although the bag hid most of
:is face she could Fee part of it. and she
saw he had a beard. She was willing to
ev.-ear it was Hoff.
Mrs. ij\-i-iÂ± told the same story, but
auded several details to it. She showed
where sne was when she went up the
staiis ana saw the man in the front room,
slit said the man in the front room
looUed like lioft and wore the same
oicthes she had se*n on him. He stood
witn nis back toward her. She told, too,
how he came to the house about 1 o'clock.
i,ut rinding Mrs. Clute was not there he
went away again saying he would be back
and aduing that he had left his tool bag
there. Mrs>. L.egÂ« let him in ihe rirst time,
uncl noticed his clothes and tool bag. She
idenuried ftiem as exhibits in the case.
Then after Hoff had gune Mrs. Clute
tame in, letting herseit in with her own
key. Later as Mrs. Legg was <n her
kitchen she heard ihe door-bell ring, but
â¢is she had arranged with her friends to
ring twice when they wanted her. and
the bell rang but once, she did not go until
it rang a second time. Then she went as
lar as the door from the dining room into
the haii and when she opentrd that site
saw that Mrs. Clute had come down to
the door to open It, and she *aw Mrs.
Ciute let Hoff in and saw them both go
upstairs. It was a few minutes after this
tr.at she heard the screams.
The father-in-law of Mrs. Legg. George
B. L/OÂ£g. iru on the stand during the
morning, but he made no such witness
lor the prosecution as did his daughter
in-law. He told how he heard the
screams upstairs, but he thought at first
they came from his Oaughter-ln-law. who
was then in the kitchen. She was com
ing out of the kitchen, having heard the
ecreams. too. when he went oack to ask
her what was the matter. She told him
the thought the screams came Irom some
children who were playing on the street,
but a* they stood in me nail tney heard
a heavy I ail upstairs.
ilrs. i-^egg raji into her room, and tak
ing her husband's revolver trom where "it
lay on the urcsser, she started upstairs
with it. Her father-in-law stopped her
and told her the had better not go up, be
cause if there should be trouble he could
not help her. She therefore left the re
volver vn her bed, but she went upstairs
anyway. Soon she came down, calling
that there was a man up there, and by
this time Mr. .Legg had tone out througn
the f roat door. She joined him there and
thev saw the man come out through me
alley at tiie side of the house, turn up
Guerrero street toward Liberty and dis
appear. Mr. Legg called alter him sev
eral times, but me man ijuickened his
steps and diii not answer.
Ucen Mr. i.> y.tÂ± said he went over to
the grocery on me opposite corner and he
returned with the groeeryman, who went
upstairs and came uowu again, saying
mere wa& a woman dead upstairs. Then

the lioard of Kducatiun, at the telephone
trying to ring up rian Jose. He ex
plained the ciise to Mr. Mark, who tried
io ring up a doctor, and tailing in his
a.Ttcmjit ne started after one and tinaily
iound Dr. liinxan, whom he brought back

WEAVING WEB
ABOUT HOFF
On cross-examination yesterday. Drury
Melone did not fly the boundaries of. the
line of. legal proof with the same spirit
of abandon that characterized his expe
rience on the stand Tuesday afternoon.
He had also exhausted hla passion to
dwell on /eminiscences of his old-time as
sociation with judge Wallace, but he re
mained true to his assertion of the day
before "that when the time came for the
settlement between himself and Judge
"Wallace of the Placerville bond matter,
then would all matters in controversy be
tween them be settled." "He admitted that
he kept no books, nor had he writings or
memoranda of. any of the items contained
In his cross-complaint. He relied solely
on his memory for the details upon which
he based his counter-claim, as he did for
his assertion that the day of the settle
ment of the Placerville case was to be the
day of judgment for all matters between
Wallace anu himself, whether they be
matters big or little, or great moment or
unimportant.
Me(pne was on the stand under cross
examination for some time before the
salient Issues of the controversy were
reached. Then he testitied that in 1881
Judge Wallace and the men Mr. Camp
bell characterized as "notorious repre
sentatives of potent factors in politics"
went to Sacramento to put In action ways
and means by. which they hoped to secure
legislation to facilitate the collection of
the Placerville bonds. Melone was ob
durate and refused to admit that he had
often, assisted by Judge Wallace and oth
ers prior to Judge Wallace's severance
with the case, endeavored to secure a
compromise with the Placerville officials.
Melone asserted that the people of Plac
erville first made the proposal by which
the compromise was effected, and said
that In that matter he asked Judge Wal
lace's advice as a friend, not as a lawyer
whom he had retained. "The lawyers In
the case did not want Wallace to inter
fere," said Melone. "They said he was an
obstructionist." Â» <
"Wallace told me before the settle
ment," continued Melone, "that his son
Ryland r would look out for my Interests,
but Instead of doing anything of the kind
he ran away to Europe. I was forced to
employ other lawyers, and when I com
plained to Judge Wallace of the neglectful
manner In which I had been treated by
his son he told me that Ryland was no
good anyhow â indolent and all that â and
that he could never have a cent of his
property. Consequently you can Imagine
my surprise when the Wallaces, father
and son, came to my office together some
months later and demanded a part of the
profit of the bond scheme.
"i was Indignant and held a conversa
tion alone with Judge Wallace. After
ward his son came into the room. We
were left alone and I told Ryland that lu
view of the conversation I had had with
his father he would better leave my
oitlce. Then Judge Wallace came back
Into the room and for the tlrst time in my
life I told him that I mistrusted him.
Judge Wallace, astounded at my asser
tion, put his hands to his temples and ran
out of the room."
In order to bring Judge Wallace's con
nection with the case up to recent years
for the purpose of contradicting Melone's
statements, Mr. Campbell presented the
witness with a letter written to him by
George W. Harwood at Syracuse, N. Y.,
in June of 1893. In this letter Harwood
etated that he would be pleased to meet
Melone and Judge Wallace regarding the
bond matter, but as his business was go
ing to keep him away from this city and
any cities they might visit It was Impos
sible, "but," the letter concludes, "I can
damn the Placervllllans." This letter
was added to the many exhibits.*
During the afternoon session Melone
testified that Porter Ashe and Assembly
man Dibble were both Interested In a- bill
introduced In the Legislature and Senate
in connection with the Placerville bond
case. He stated that Ashe was -in favor
of the case, not on account of a friend
ship existing between himself and Judge
Wallace and his son, but that he was in
favor of the bill because he heard that
Judge Williams, a relative of Tom Wil
liams Jr. of the racetrack, was openly op
posed to the bill. Ashe and Williams were
bitter enemies through some turf transac
tions and Ashe wanted to even an old
score. Melone said that Judee Wallace,
in 1SS8, owed him $10,000; that he held no
note or entry In his book of the amounts
that Wallace owed him. When asked by
Campbell if this was not a very unbusl
ness-like way of handling his finances,
Melone said that he had at that time ex
plicit confidence in the Judge, but he was
aware of the fact If Wallace had died
that he would not have received a cent,
as he had no records of Wallace's indebt
edness.
It was wrested -from Melone by Camp
bell that $1000 of the $10,000 was charged
as a commission for placing a loan with
the Spring Valley Water Company in 18S8.
The corporation borrowed $150,000 from
the Judge at 4 per cent, said Melone, and
at that time the Spring Valley company
was making vast improvements and was
borrowing large sums of money. Camp
bell attempted to prove that it took only
a portion of a day's work on the part of
Melone to place the money, which In
cluded a short conversation with Charles
Webb Howard, president of the company,
which occurred on the street.
Melone denied that there was an agree
ment between himself and Wallace to the
effect that he was to furnish the money
and Wallace the brains In connection with
the floating*- of the bonds. He also denied
that he ever made any agreement with
Ryland, the son of Judge Wallace, in con
nection with the case. Melone aald that
he did not owe Ryland a cent for services.
He said that he had a written agreement
Â¦with the Judge and that he was under
the impression that any work the son did
on the case , was in the interest of the'
father. ,
Daniel Meyer was called to the stand
and furnished much fun. His shrewd
business methods were ironclad, to say
the least. He stated that he was ap
proached by Drury Melone In connection
with the Pacific Bank affair and told that
Judge . Wallace would make a good at
torney for him. Ho thought the matter
over and came to the conclusion that It
would be a good move. Wallace said that
he would -not handle the case for less than
a contingent fee of $10,000. Meyer accept
ed the proposition. L*ater Wallace sent
word that he would not handle the case
for less than $15,000. Meyer then made a
unique proposition to the Judge. He said
that he wotold pay him $15,000 if he won
the case, but that he would require Wal
lace to deposit . $3000 with him, which he
should lose if he lost the case. This was
not agreeable to Wallace and they finally
compromised by Wallace accepting $2500
as compensation for his services.
Meyer was asked by Campbell why Wal
lace tried to raise him from a ten to a
fifteen thousand dollar fee. He answered:
"A lawyer is never satisfied." HÂ» was
dismissed .amid laughter. â¢Â¦"..-
