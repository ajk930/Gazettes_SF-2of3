NOW % look-a-herc. said the old groceryman as he sat by
the stove smoking a dricd-up cigar that the wrapper
had broken off and curled up, and he had licked it
with his tongue and got the wrapper to lie quiet while 1
he filled the air of the grocery with two-for-a-nickcl incense, j
as the crown-up Bad Boy came in dressed in n natty cuU- I
way mat, with a bunch of violets in his buttonhole, "we
might as well come, to an understanding first as iast. What j
this community wants to know is where and how have 'you \
made this money that you arc blowing in around this 'ere j
town." and the old man looked stern as an inquisitor as he j
ran his tongue again around the desiccated cigar to hold |
the wrapper to it r- work.*
"Oh. you want r.ie to <jo*ifcsT to some j: crime, do you?" '
paid the big boy. as he 611c"u his. lungs with the odor of the i
Imrncd cabbage leaf and -coughed and opened the door toy

"\\\ Â¦!}. that is the qucstioi," said the old man. wetting his
finger and putting out the conflagration that had broken out
on one side of the cigar and was rapidly working its way
toward his" mouth. "We. had a mcetirrg nf trustees of the j
church after the collection was taken up last Sunday," and
thfy foxtnd a $20 bill in the. collection plate, which was I
tracer! tc yon," and the old i^ati looked sharply at the Ba-1 1
Boy to sec if he w*s "going ir. d**ny it. "We turned th? bill |
over to one of the trust*-?? who is a banker, and he had to i
confess that it was a good bill, but such a thing never hap- i
period in the church before, and after the minister pot over
being faint he insisted that the money had a bad smell about I
it 3? though it was crooked money. He said from what he

3'ourself. Be you in the preen-goods Hne? A man in New . I
York once wrote me that for a hundred v dollars in spot cash
he would send me ten thousand dollars' worth of money
â¢that jou ccuidn't 'ell from genuine. You see that box* of
sawdust down there Under the stove that I use for a spit
box? Well, by" gosh! that is all I got for my hundred
dollars. .How do I jknow but you are the fell.ow that got my
hundred dollars?" f
"Ah, ha!" said the boy as he pulled off his gloves and put
them it> the breast pocket of his coat so the tinger-tip5
stuck out, "so'yqu tried to get ten thousand dollars in coun
terfeit money to spend here among the neighbors, and you
got sawdust, .while I come here with good money thatr I"
earned and try to spend it like a gentleman, and I: get it xn
the neck," and the big boy took out a piece of paper, some
tobacco, rolied a. cigarette, lit it, smoked V minute, and con- 1
tinued: "If I had remaiq^d here in-this town after being a j
tough boy, against whom'eA'ery hand Was turned, taken a
job driving a delivery wagon and reformed, it would have
taken me the balance of my life to convince the people that
I had enjoyed a change of heart, but you would have said in
time that I was all right, but would bear watching. I re
member that old minister. You s remember when us boys
put the softsoap on the steps of our house when he was
making a call, and how he slipped'when he went out and slid
on the basement of his black Sunday trousers clear out on
the sidewalk? He said at that time that only his feelings and
trousers were hurt, but I think now. that his spine was (in
jured, and that he is, a regular Indian, who never forgets,
and that he has laid that softsoap up against meV all ..these
years. But you tell the trustees that .; they "'"-/ nceHn^t : : worry
about the money, as I made it perfectly square, speculating
in stocks, promoting trusts, forming syndicates, developing
mines and (telling; them, plotting; additions to towns and sell

"Gambling! every con darn one of 'cm!" said the old
groceryman as he threw the cigar stub into the box of saw
dust and got up to walk the floor. "You are one of' those
manipulators, eh?" and he shook his fist in the ".face of the
young man.
"Oh, I don't know," said the Bad Boy. as he lit another
cigarette. Xou buy canned corn cheap in the summer.
knowing you can sell it at a big advance in the winter. , You
lay in a stock of sugar in the spring, knowing when the time
comes to preserve fruit that it will be scarce and you can put
up the price. I look around the country, in the summer at'
the crops and I am satisfied the railroads are jroine^to be;
troubled to house the crops, and I feel that railroad -stocks
are a good thing, so I buy stocks for a rise, and vou and. I
both make money on. our judgment. .You make a hundred
dollars and I make a hundred thousand. You arc a -small
tin-horn gambler, While I am a king-pin gambler. You put
poor quarter, of a dollar in the collection plate and nobody
kicks; I put my twenty dollars in and everybody kicks.
Say, don't- you know that every man who does business is
a gambler? If we guess right we are possessed of great
heads, apd they say we are smart; but if your sugar and
canned corn and my railroad stocks go" down, arid we lose
and have to bust ur> in business.^they say it is all on account
of gambling. Oh, you make me tired, you old canned-coni
gambler, you," and the boy slapped his old friend on the
back until he saw stars.
'.-. "Well. Â¦ niebbe you are right," said the old man. as he
thought it over, "bu t, my gosh! if I. were yoii I would pÂ»**
money hi the collection plata In sort of Installments, because

Kumcnt about how we make our money. Money is a tcood
deal like the Kentucky colonel described whisky. He Â»aid
all whisky was good, but some whisky was better than
others. Money that is earned .by hard work- is trood, but -
money, that is earned by the exercise of the brain is better,
if there is more of it, eh, boy?"
"Speakine of bills, I remember once, years ago, dad had,
a bill against a little Irishman that he couldn't collect by
any ordinary methods, and one day when dad was kicking
about the twenty dollars that he Was shy, I asked him why
he didn't jro to the man and tell him if he didn't pay the.
money he would take it out of his hide. / I told him the*
Irishman was a little fellow, with only one lunjj, and that I
knew he hadn't sand enough to fight; 'arid if dad went right
after him? with' blood in his eye he would get his money all ,
rijiht. Well, after dad had got me^to^say!r.itiaKain,>that,the : :

dad coming back â on the installment plan, rfe had left his
coat and vest down at the Irishman's house and a coat waa
eating his straw hat, while one leg of his trousers had been
rhewed off bv a dog, and dad had his shirt torn at ths
bosom and the sleeve, his collar and necktie was in his hand,
his nose was bleeding, his eyes were blackened and he had
one hand on the small of his back, "where the goat had kicked
him with- his head, arwi he looked meek and lowly. 'Did
you get the nioney, dad?' I asked him.
"'No. but I got my money's worth/ said dad.
â¢ "'Could the ; Irishman fight, dad?' I asked him.
"Oh. I could have whipped him all right.' said dad,

, "You needn't botheY about' that," said the boy, laugh

with four walnut shells on her paws which the boy had put
on fn the last five minutes.
"You don't own the grocery anymore."
'"WhatJ" exclaimed the old rosn, Jumping to his feet and'
rubbing his left hand where the cat had scratched .him in
gratitude for having relieved her of one of the walnut sheila.
"Let me tell you. young rnaji, 'tliat'I don't owe a penny,qn

"That was this morning," said. the' boy; "You don't own

you were out attending the funeral of one of your best cash

The discussion of amusements is
not always amusing. Even people
who are very amusing in public are
eornetlme* far otherwise in private. A
celebrated professional buttoon -once said,
"I'm Grlm-aJ-di'to make you laugh at

rsake upon. Ji!s own name, and no doubt
It Ti-rung a bitter truth out of the pun
ster's own patned experience. How little
the gay crowd assembled in theater Â¦ or

formers, that is, in preparatory toil or
ccziEeQuent pain, headache, heartache.

happens that the fun cf the Junior* mean*
tgony to their seniors, as when the fun
leads to exce* ees and degenerates to vice
ca the part of. the young, despfte the re
monstrance and entreaties of the eld folks
tit home. It is one of the incontroverti
ble fact* of experience that a large pro
portion of the griefs of after life are the
inevitable harvest following the mistaken
or excessive pursuit of amusements in
earlier year*. . .
But mistaken or excessive indulgence in
eny of the interests of life is one thing
and the question of the legitimacy of
Those Interests Is Quite another affair.
Happily the view of amusements taken
by the Puritans is largely a thing of the
past. They eschewed sensuous pleasures
In obefiiencÂ© to the idea that it was their
religious duty to modify "fleshly lusts
ivfcich war tgainst the soul." Possibly,
â¢ too, if the truth were known, their an
'tipathy to physical delights was intensi
fied by yet another cause. In the heroic
period of Puritanism the Puritan was
â¢practically identical with the Roundhead,
ftrhose moral and social antithesis was
Â¦the gay Cavalier. The mutual antipathy
of these two vras a hearty and an all
Â¦round business, bearing as much of a re
ligious as of a political complexion, the
ascetic Puritan being the saint and the
jbon vivant Cavalier being the sinner.
l"VVhat the one did the other avoided, and
nrhat the one loved the other loathed.
The Puritan idea of life is virtually ob
eolete among Protestants, and therefore
the asceticism which characterized Puri
tan customs has largeiy disappeared from
â¢eociety. Old hard and fast lines between
things secular and religious are rapidly
beins" effaced by modern, movements of
religious truth, and the antiquated fiction
that the pleasures cf sense are necessarily
sinful only lingers in dark corners. It is
ro doubt better bo, even though; tho
tradition from the old to the new may be
fravjrht with Eome perils. The human or
ganism, however complex, is all one, and
Its interests, sensibilities, emotionsâ in
short, all its multiform parts and quali
tiesâare naturally and inseparably inter
twined. It iÂ« coming to be realized as It
Rover was before that the came Gcd who
made the eoul made the body alsoâ that it
Is a false view of the harmony of nature
Â¦which Bets up a necessary antagonism
between the two-ar.d that the true policy
cf religious progress is to treat the ma
terial part of our nature as the handmaid
of the spiritual, rather than to set the
eplritual to Bnub and crush our physical
sensibilities. For some purposes a key
Is a better Implement than a crowbar,
end there are forces of nature that can
be better subdued by being harnessed
than by being resisted or defied. In !me
with this general view of things It Is
deemed that material pleasures In the
thape of occasional or periodical amuse
ments may be made to aid rather than to
hinder the progress In well-being: of our
entire nature, body and souL . ;;V, *
The functions of amusement change
with the years of those who have re
course to its beneficent offices. To tho
young its various agencies are so many
methods of expression for superfluous
physical energy and exuberant animal
spirits; to those who are passing through
the more sedate stages of life It affords
relief; from the stress of business and the
strain of care. In early life therefore Its
modes'of expression are apt to.be spon
taneous . and natural, and in after years
its appliances tend to become more or
less artificial, but in each case. where the
â¢purpose is good the results are beneficent
; In proportion as excesses nre avoided.
â¢The day has gone by 'for prohibiting, say,
; chess "and whist to ; the older : folks at
home while commending .the pastimes of
marble, top and ball among" the ' children
outside. There la no moral code .confining
rational forma of recreation and diver-
slon to any clas3, agre or condition of life.
; ; But -parallels between ; the pastimes of
youth and thosa of maturity will bear
watching; ; For example, such trials of
speed, : : strength, skill and endurance
unong boys -, as racing, wrestling and the
like, are Â¦ legitimate enough because they
are not necessarily demoralising in their
effects. But there are "contests 'between
men" which cannot be placed in the same
category. Coursing, horse-racing' and
boxing may, perhaps, be literally classed
as pastimes, but "the turf represents
an outlawed pastime because of its con
nection with gambling, while r "the ring"
is doubly* outlawed by â¢ the same connec
tion added to Its Intrinsic brutality. More

millennium, when artistic taste and moral
preference may ce .more nearly uniform
than they are now.

and yet. like the' making. of 'books, it is
one of, those things to which "there is
no, end. The Puritans renounced It. but
to the descendants of the Puritans there
seems no Inherent evil in It. but rather
the reverse. This is partly because our
standards of judgment regarding the rela
tions of the spiritual and the material in
human nature have changed, and partly
because, with the spread of enlighten
ment, the world has grown better. The
incidental evils connected with dancing
however, are much the same as they al
ways have been, and they require to be
to, "Keep the stage clean." A play reea
Â«iot be dull in order to be free from Im
pure suggestions ; there are popular the
aters in this city whose record proves
this.
The moral aspects of amusements ara
simpler and more pleasant to contemplate
than they were to our ancestors. "We ara
about to enter upon a century In which
It will not be a sin to sing or whistle or
dance or go to a theater; a century In
which, on the religious side of life, men
will learn to train the forces of tho
n>shly nature to subserve the purposes
of the spiritual, rather than to continue
to fight and mortify the flesh as the foo
of the spirit. On the other hand, many
of the same old perils remain, among
them the radical one of allowing minor
matters to gain the upper hand over *U3.
Whatever agency of amusement may

springs in part, of course, from other
reasons than its amusing Qualities. Such
"brief allusion as can be made to It here,
however, must be confined to the play
as an agency of public amusement. When
so regarded is Its Influence rood, bad or
Indifferent? This Question can only be.
answered approximately and in the light
of varying- considerations. â The Puritans
transmitted their utrons dislike of _ the
play, together with: their religious procliv
ities and habits, to their English-speaking
descendants, so that even to this day it
is in some quarters an ecclesiastical of
fense for a church member to visit a
theater. Quite recently, however, when
"The 'Wnltefrlars Club," in London, dis
cussed the question, "Ha3 thÂ© iloder.i
Stage Helped Public Morality?' the most
unqualified approval of the. stage was
uttered by the chairman of the meeting,
a prominent clergyman. This fact speaks
volumes, testifying alike to the improved
spirit of the stage and the modified at
titude of the church. On the side of the
church must be reckoned the widespread
change of sentiment referred to above,
and* on the part of the stage a general
abandonment of the cheap cynicism and
Impure suggestion which were formerly
but too common. In favor of wholesome
sentiment and clean humor. Both
changes are in the right direction, but
they are as yet Incomplete, and that be
cause of faults on both sides. Some day,
perhaps, dramatic Incidents and events
of Bible history may be frankly represent
ed on the stage, on a smaller scale, of
course, than has been done at Oberam
mergau. without arousing in the publla
mind any widespread sense of Incongru
ity. But whether the approach to that
day shall be slow or swift mu3t depend
largely upon play-writers, managers an I
the theatrical profession generally. Xobla
sentiments can be best expressed by noble
souls, and In proportion as such souls
take hold of the stage they will purge It
of drivel - and fustian and dirt. Thera Is
ample living proof of this. Not only can
the play-going public of to-day appreciate
.what is good (the good in morals that la),
but It prefers the good to the bad. Some
theatrical managers and proprietors have
the sense to discern how steadily and
surety the public taste has advanced In
this respect in recent years, and they keep
full houses and a wholesome reputation.
It is the few, not the many, who like tha
flavor of game that is "high." Host peo

can't be taught out and out. And one who
is endowed with It will need little teach

Would you smile gleefully when saying

more absurd cases than the gestures that

Many a woman with well-rounded figure
and natural grace of motion fancies that
she is fully equipped to pose. She could
be an artist's model, she is sure, or an

' VThou art a worm!" Luna has reached
the conclusion and she announces it pos

Suppose that when I say "Turning the
streams I from their., channels," ' I should
gesture toward the tree tops in the glen.
Wouldn't that be absurd? I am thinking:
of the streams In their channels, not of
my_arms. Streams and -their channels lie
along the ground, and- as the picture
comes to my mind I suggest it as best I
can by a motion of the arm.
This' applies .to the simplest picture.
More elaborate " poses should be guided
by the same.liw of spontaneity. Think,
when you go before the camera, what you
are going- to represent: get yourself into
the mood of- the picture to be, and your
pose arranges itself.
Even the amateur, sitting for photo
graphs to send to friends and relatives,
should know this much' about posing or

There Is great danger of spoiling; good
poses by over-elaboration of dress. Sim

display clothes, your clothes are made to
adorn you. I hayÂ© tried many styles of

knitted silk. My mother made the lining

garment. It dings to the form more

âits effect Is that of jersey.

chosen the draperies loest suited to her

" Ernest Seton-Thompson in a lecture In
Baltimore recently switched off in one

story of a pointerâ a genuine canine Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The dog lived in
New Tork and was remarkably well be
haved and was particularly friendly to
ward the children In the well-bred set in
which his lot was cast. His only idlosyn
cracy was his habit of disappearing for a
day or two at a time. During ona of
these periods of disappearance a dog was
caught in a distant section of the city
who was vicious,' degenerate and partic

One day Patrice met an actress that

Â¦with the same ambition- This actress
had always been very thin.
"Dear old girl. I hear you have

Patrice, in a heart-to-heart voice.
"At last!*' replied the thin actress.
"I have just been asked to recommend

stock company's daily rehearsing,
with thirty ne-w sides every week,

"Has it paid?" interrupted Patrice.

j? T is said thnt Patrice once felt she
had the soul of a tragedienne. In-
ddentally, she had the curves cf
a Venus.
She did not pay much attention
to her figure, but the public did. It
liked her motions better than her

The upshot cf the matter was that
In time she gave up her legitimate
ideas and took to tiie vaudeville stag^Â»,

playing poses for twenty minutes.
She could vary this act from season

THE SUBTLE ART
OF POSINGNotable Book of Travels
by a Californian.
5* X her book Ju^t published. "Back
il theoshâ A Woman's Wanderings." Mrs.
I William Beckman has struck the key
note of successful writing. You fee! in
reading her work that you are not re
*:riÂ«-ted to recieivlns: your impressions
through written words, but rather are be
[ng entertained by' a brilliant converfa-;
licslst. l'>" one who has traveled far but.
best Of all. has profited by her traveling
and has not allowed a sinrle item of in
terest to so unnoticed.
Mr?. Bockman possesses trie rare charm
of writing as rhe speaksâ fluently, brll
1!.ir;tly and to a purpose. To all lovers
of travel her recent book will appeal most
f-trorcprly, for St Is in a colloquial vein
r. nd hy one who has Fecn and noted what
others and apprecrate but cannot ex
j-rÂ«ss. Best of all. this Ixtek Kives to us
j-'Mmpses of the world throuph the can
<]\<] and impartial eyes of an American
wr.manâ in fact, a Californlan. for Mrs.
Ijrrkm.in is a rerident of Sacramento.
Th? reader cannot help feelinp that the
puthor frauRCs what s*Â»e sees by stand
prds accojdin^ to the reader's ovrn lights,
r.r.d it imparts a corfiicnce not Kencrally
r.wakcned in a book of similar character.
Jn reading books of travel by fore'.pn au
thors we fannot help at times a feeling
cf unbelief .for the realization is ever pres
ent that whatever might have impressed
them in a certain -way might have been
regarded by us In a diametrically oppo-
Elte light hafl we been there to see for
ourselves.
Parts of MrÂ«. Beckman's book may seem
hastily writtenâ in fact, the author tells'
t:s that many of her ideas and descrip
tions were recorded while traveling from
place to placeâ but this i? rather a merit
than a fault in a work of this character;
for it is not literary effort that the reader
crbthes, but rather impressions while
ri'.aces are frefh in the mind of the author.
You feel that what Mrs. Beckman has
to Fay is fact, not fiction, and yet her style
is fo raFv that there is not a dry page in
the l>ook.
The countries which are included In this
charminjj scries of j >c n siiet<~hos are: Eng
land. Ireland. Scotland. Holland. Ger
many. Denmark. Norway. Sweden. Fin
land. Russia. Austria. Hungary. Switzer
land. Italy. Egypt; Palestine. Syria. Tur
key. Asia Minor, Orrcce and France.
On her trip the author has allowed lit
tle to oseape hrr. ar.d is absolutely frank
5rj tbe expression of her opinions. She is
American to the rore. -as can be seen in
tbi* observation made in a comparison of
th^ laboring classes cf the two nations:
Whatever tbc rauw T know not, but Enpland

Mrs. B"ckman also apprprintes a pood
Ftory. ThiÂ«= hap' the rral eM Irish flavor
tn it. for it was culled while driving over
the hills to the Lakes of Killarney:

Â«"rn no orchart? whatever in all of Ireland. I
heard of some arpl* tree* near. Cappoquln. and
wes promised some elder, but had only the
premise.
Her description cf the Lake? of Killar
r.Â»>y is especially intcrestir.tr. for It is a
view cf t_he lakes through the eyes of a
<"\i!:forr;;:in. and cne has ?een and
appreciated the wonders of h*>r native
land. The sight impresses Mr?. Beckman,
.ir.d she gives cue credit, but is also posi
tive in her criticismâ probably Moore
would have felt the same way had he
Ytorn afforded the opportunity for com
parison:
The C&y following- the storm' Â¦*Â¦ pleasant
er.d we enjoyed the lakes greatly. They arÂ»
â¢ueM worth the trouble experienced in getting
to them, but I could not. in all conscience,
prow wild over "crag* that lift to clouds their
f-:raK>ry heads." all of which reads well,' but
I doubt very much if Moore had traveled ex
tensivelyâor. If he had. ,he was given a bit
to exasperation.

-Just, to' pick up and glance through
George .Wharton James' ' book, â¢ "In ; and
Around-.tho Grand Canyon," one v/ould at
once' wish to make, its further acquaint
ance. In the first place it is so excellently
illustrated' with such a large^number of
clear and striking views oCscenes and life
in this greatest of all the world's' canyons,'
and in the next the large type and easy
arrangement of subjects makes the mat
ter so readily accessible. Mr. James has
not written his book from a trip : or;two
through the ennyon, but it is the result of
ten years'* visits pnd tireless explorations.-
The. book Is not without dramatic interest."
fQâ¢ the thrilling adventures: of tho early,
explorers are vlvidlv told, and the author
has a few- hairbreadth escapes of his own
to tell as well.,. But the main interest of
the book lies In the description of .the
scenery, the Indians and their legends and
customs picturesque. Mr. James*, book is
deserving of cipecial mention in the fact
that he did his. writing: while on tbe trail
nnd in the heart of the wondersTof , the

The author Is. so careful and so closely
analytical that at times ho possibly loses
dramatic effect in his effort to make every
detail perfectly , claar and the action-^of
tho book consistent- As Mark Grafton,
the man who is .telling the story, Is him
self a lawyer, pess'bly we can forgive th?
technical language of the descriptions.
The dialogue Is .largely between Grafton
and Dr. Guthrie^ and or course it is to be
. 'â¢ . ,'
Grafton becomes interested at once and
that interest is heightened when. he finds
that his. friend and connection by.'mar
riage, Dr. Guthrle,- is the physician of
Ruth Wardleigh. Guthrie has' been in
the East, but returns just at this period,

twenty legations and these were frequent

of charges d"a3aires.
Salvador .has sent one of Its former
Presidents to represent it at the American
capital, Senor Don Rafael Za!divar. Min
ister Zaldivar was President of this Cen
tral American, republic from 1576 to 1SSS.
and during his administrations the coun
try was very prosperous. On account of
ill health he resigned and went to Parts,
v.here he carried on extensive business en.
terprises. During this time he was ap
pointed Salvadorean envoy at Paris.
Rome. London and Madrid, and spent
twelve years In those cities. Ills family,
which consists of his wife, seven daugh
ters and one son, is now In Salvador, but
wilV probably join him at the beginning of
the official season in January.
For the first time In Its history Uruguay
ha* established diplomatic relations w'th
against any European usurpation In their
territories.
The Nicaragua Canal project has un
doubtedly had its-share in arousing this
desire for representation at Washington,
for of course ' the construction of that
waterway will mean an Immense widening
of Centra! and South American trade. Be
that as it may, all of the Southern repub
lics have established flourishing legations
at Washington, and the envoys almost,
without exception are men of Â¦wealth, who
have not only been active In affair3 of
state, but have accumulated fortunes of
their own in private enterprises.
Dr. Eduardo Wilde, the Argentine Min
ister, is a notable, example of this. He pos
sesses great' wealth.' and. while a doctor 61
medicine by profession, he has given more
attention to political affairs than to his
practice. He has tv.lce been a member of
the President's Cabinet and while Minis
ter of Education he inaugurated some
very radical reforms in the school system
of his country. He completely separated
church and state, and established free
schools, something on the plan of our
own, and built a large number of fine
school buildings.
He has leased Colonel Colton's handsome
residence on Connecticut avenue, where he
has established the Argentine legation.
Senora Wilde is considered one of . the
most beautiful women among the families
cf the diplomatic corps, and is planning to
enter the social gayeties on an elaborate
scale.
Scncr Corrca. the Nlcaraguan Minister,
has held his present position since last
year, and Is without doubt one of tha
busiest diplomats of the corps, but when
Congress convenes and the canal bill
comes up for consideration he will be even
busier. He is the son cf wealthy parents,
and wa3 edi3catÂ»?Â«l at the best schools of
Nicaragua anil Guatemala. Before enter
ing the diplomatic service he had ma-la
quite a reputation as a jurist, was dis
trict judge at Tctonicapan and had writ
ten several. treatises on law and philoso
phy, which were introduced as text books
In the Central American universities.
Senor Fernando E. Guachalla. the Bo
livian Hini3ter, arrived in Washington tha
latter part of October, and has taken
apartments for the winter. He has a
young daughter and son with him, and
Senora Guachalla and the remaining eight
children expect to join him In the spring:.
Senor Guachalla was the former Minister

New Faces in the Diplomatic CorpsA MAJORITY of hands were held up.
Such hands: What would a palm
ist have made of them?
"On the contrary â two out of
three?" said Jaggcrs.
There was r.o response.
"Sudden death It is'."
And to Xed Glover the decision sounded
like a sentence. His mind went wander
ing back to the trial and condemnation
cf some poor devil at the Old Bailey, In
his first days of journalistic work.
By this time the last of the lookers-on
ec-emed to have arrived, filling up the
Fpa.ce in front of the saloon; men from
Platts Valley and the Ridge, aa well as
the miners of the Drift.'
Dankes fook half-a-dozen miscellaneous
coins from his pockeL
"JLet me see 'em," said J&gffers.
Dankes submitted them to inspection,
and tht-y were pronounced "kerrect."
"Heads." said the captain, "Is choice of
weapons by the Britisher; tails, the choice
lies with Digges."
Dankes, with a whispered prayer that
would havo been deemed impious at Ex
eter Hall. "Great Father, make it heads!"
rattled the coin* between the palms of his
closed hands and then flungr them, to fall
on a piece of ground that had been
tramped into somethinff like a smooth
surface. . â¢'
The comra'ttee bent forward and count
ed them.
"Four tails, two heads," eaid .Taggers.
The captain stooped to pick them up.
and counted them as he handed the coins
back to Dankes.
"One, two, three, four tails; one, two
heads.".

"Knlvts," paid Digges, pulling his own
from Its theath and feeling its edge, with
the eatisfact'on of Shylock in the play. -
"Parfis arid gentlemen," Eaid the cap
tain, "make way."
Hope* and ptakes were brought, a ring
marked out. the principals took up posi
tions, with their seconds; and the cap
tain, being voted umpire, lounged into the
ring. Jaegers was in attendance upon
Dicees. and Dankes stood V>y Glover. â¢- The
men stripped, Digges naked to the waist.
Glover keeping on his snirt of white flan
nel, the plc-eves turned up to his elbows.
Digges Ehaggy-haired, iow-browed. thick
set, bull-necked, clean-shaven, his hair
cut close (he never gave an adversary
more to lay hold on than was absolutely
necessary; "you never kr.ow'd what kind
of a cur you vras fightin* with," was his
niotto); Glover now clean-shaven, except
for his mustache, his hair brushed from
his forehead, a limber, well-built young
fellow, but slight compared with his ad
versary.
The tt.cti being prepared, the captain
ready to signal the commencement of
hostilities, Dlgrtres stepped forward to
shake hands. Ned remained at his post.
"It is the custom." said Dankes, "to
ta-Re each other's hand." â¢
"I'll soe him to hell first!" said Ned,
excitedly. \
"My friend prefers otherwise," said
Dnnkes. with great dignity.
Ulg-pc-s FhrugR-ed his shoulders, and Â«pat
upon the ground. %
"You 3re excited, Ned. keep cool,"
Dankes whimpered to his friend.
"You know whore my will Is."- Ned re
plied. "GooÂ»l-by, dear old pal:" Â¦
"Ned, Ned'" said Dankea taking his
hand and wringing It fervently. "Ins the
man who don't make his will that pegs
out- Tonder brute has made no will.
Buck up; stand firm, watch -him. hit him
under the left rib." .
"Now, gentlemen, get to work," said the
captain, and dropped his handkerchief.
Digges lumbered forward, crouching aa
5f for a spring; then drew back, and stood
straight as a Btatue.
Glover watched him, approaching some
what timidly, as If uncertain of his play.
Then leapt at his man with a cry and
hit him. but more with the handle of his
Jcnlfe than the blade.
There was a shout of derision from the
Xriends of Dlgrges.

Synopsis.
oi the critical; aa the- umpire stepped be
tween the men and marked It as about or
round.
Digges emlled and rubbed his breast,
which was grazed and showed blood.
"First blood, anyhow," said one of the
men of Platts Valley.
"Dear Ned, why did you alter your
grip of the haft? Ef you'd struck him j
up. you'd had him. God confound and
curse him!" said Dankes.
Ned made no reply; but at the Call of *
"Time!" stepped forward and went for
his man again, evidently having laid to
heart the lesson of Dankes, that ignor
ance sometimes Is better equipped than
knowledge; but Digges warded him
skillfully and turned his 'blade. There
upon Ned stabbed at him viciously.
Digges made what they termed "fine
play" In his wards and -retreats and ad
vances and was as nimble as a light
weight.
From this moment it was a cat and
mouse game. The Drifters had seen It
played before, with â¢ a far more skillful
adversary than Glover. Dankes grew hot
and cold as the unequal contest went on;,
stopped, now and then, by the umpire,
more. It seemed, by way of keeping up the
sporting features of the encounter than
from a technical regard for its rules.
There had been only three breaks when
"Timer" -was called for what proved to be
the last bout. Ned gTipped his blade,
with a smile at Dankes, held it low, and
waited for his adversary; who advanced
with clenched teeth and a look of savage
determination. They sparred for a mo
ir>ent, then retired; but met again. - Ned.
cleverly avoiding a deadly thrust, raised
his arm to strike, forgetting the careful
instructions of Dankes to thrust upward.
Digger caught his arm and literally
crushed it In his iron prrip. Â¦ Glover's
wesnon fell to the ground.
"For God's sake spare him!" cried
Dankes.
But while he spoke Digges had stabbed
his friend to the .heart, and. as Dankes
sprang- forward, flung him Into the ol3
man's arms â dead.
CHAPTER XXVI.-;
"A BOLT FROM THE BLUE."
The fatal encounter, that was fore
shadowed even before' Hiram Dexter, al
lied himself with the assassin Digges, was
ordained. From the moment those two
opposing forces met in State street Ned
Glover was doomed. It cannot be that
Euch fateful links as those that drew
Glover to Blind Man's Drift could be
forged by chance.
It is strange that among a community
of brave men Abner Digges should nave
been permitted to dominate the camp of
Blind Man's Drift But tyranny ts in
nate in some, and it is the destiny oft
.otners to submit; some for the love of
peace, some from idle inclination, some
from timidity, some from lack of ambi
tion, some for penurious reasons. Any
how, wherever men assemble together, a
community of bandits or industrials, one
man rises to the top; one man seizes the
democratic throne and rules, often by
bluster, more frequently by sheer physi
cal force and brutality, Abner Digges,
ethletie, ignorant, obstinate, cruel, an ex
l-ert with deadly weapons and possessing
a chief share In the local enterprise, was,
a^ we know, boss of the drift.
Apart from the grudge he owed Ned
Glover he carried about with him the
blood money of Hiram Dexter. The love
crazed millionaire would never have dared
to .do the deed he more than hinted. at lo
enother; but the murder of Ned Glover
vas just as much his handiwork as that
of the assassin whom he bribed. The
news of Glover's death reached- the Mail,
at Chicago through a news agency, many
days after the event. Mr. Storey, with
the telegraphic message in his hand, went
straight to Dexter's office. Dexter had
not been seen for several days. Sam had
packed his valise for a short journey.
' Massa," he said, "was awful bad; more
than sick; just crazy."
The affair was sufficiently serious, in
Mr. Storey's estimation, to Justify the
"ITnion Telegraph Company disclosing to
him a message that Dexter had received
pome three days previous to the Mail dis-
T-atch. It ran as follows: "To Hiram
Dexter, Chicago: Your man, Glover, in-,
suited me; we fought next day, presence
of committee of camp and many, others,
a square deal with knives, after toss for
.choice of weapons. Blind Man's Drift
ain't proud of the-se affairs, but what can
you do when men get drunk and raise
Cain? The Drift gives him a funeral
equal to his position, and none but's sorry
it happened. ABNER DIGGES."
The Mail had little more to tell than
this, except to state that Mr. Glover had
gone but to Platts Valley and the Drift as
the representative of Mr. Hiram Dexter,
and also to write up the country for tlv?
Mail. Chicago had, junfortunately, had
only two letters from its able correspond
ent, dealing with the scenic and metallur
gical characteristics of the district and his
death was a loss to the community. Ht.
was one of those roving and adventurous
Englishmen to whom the world was in
debted in many ways as pioneers of civili
zation, and who carried their lives in
their hands. It was pad to reflect that al
though the frontier that divided .civiliza
tion from barbarism was so comparative
ly near them, it was too far off" for tho
Sheriff's writ to run successfully or the
ordinary influences of law and order to
have effect. In cases of unparalleled out
rage it would, of course, be possible to ._
send a posse to the rescue, but the Gov
ernment and the police had found it poll-,
tic to more or less acquiesce in the rough
and ready justice that communities of .
men living beyond the pale of civilization,
carrying on the adventurous work of the
prospector, the hunter and the pioneer of
new settlements, had devised for them- ,
selves. As a rule their free and fearless
government was not unfair, though It was
generally the rule of the strongest. In
the case of Mr. Edwin Glover, it appeared
that a quarrel had arisen between him
and the man Digges and that a meeting
was arranged and a duel' fought to'tho,
death. Glover was slain. The only fea
ture in the case that might call for Inves
tigation was the fact that Digges had a
grudge against Glover, arising out of the
misconduct of Digges during a visit to '
Chicago, where . the frontiersman hail
come to paint the city red and had met
with his deserts. But, on the whole, these
men. who, despite their lawless lives and
disregard of the common habits of civil
ized people, carried on the work of em
pire building, were best left to their own
resources. Soon as a place became too
civilized for them and the police, and the
Â¦ schoolmaster, and the minister and ' the
press appeared upon the. scene such of
them as did not accept the new conditions
and come under the law moved lurthor
afield, and made new camps and new set
tlements, and so the wild story of empire
building went on.
Zella had not uttered' a word for hours
after Mr. .Storey had broken the news to
her. He had found her reading to Bridget
O'Hagan a book about London. Zella had
promised that Bridget should accompany
her and Ned to Europe. For weeks it had
been the entertainment of the two, after
the day's work wasover, to sit down by '
the stove In Bridget's parlor, Brid
get with h/r knitting, with a guide
to LfOndon. *Ze.lla would select the pages
that dealt with the places Ned had men
tioned to her. Downlnc, street was a'fav
orite haunt, and the 'church of St. Clem
ent Danes, and Fleet street generally; and
Zella had traced the localities on a map.
The story of the Temple had interested
.them deeply. Zella discovered for herself
historical landmarks. She showed Bridget
a picture of the tomb of her countryman. â¢
Oliver Goldsmith, and promised to read
to nor the story of ."The Vicar of Wake
field," which Bridget had never heard of â¢*
She found Holland House and an account
of the cottage where Tom Moore had
lived, near Muswell Hill, and Bridget had
expressed herself as "kinder forgivin'
towards the brutal Saxon," who cherished
the memory of the only poet she had ever
heard of. Though Zella reminded her of
the fact that Shakespeare was a- poet,
Bridget did not understand that he was
any more than ."wan av thim that made
S'ays for the -actors, more isplcially for
Isther Booth and John McCulloch who
alas, both were dead! :â¢ And, oh, the pity
av it that geniuses should ivver die!"
It was in the midst of one of the happi
eet evenings they had spent together over
the guide to London, that Fate timed the i
bitter blow that struck them down. -?â¢
"I should like to speak to Miss Brunnen
alone," said Storey, the big boned, tender
hearted, courageous Westerner. â¢
-"Oh, Indade!" said Bridget rather
testily.
"I havo no secrets from Mistress
O Hagan." said Zella, as Bridget gathered
up her knitting. - ;.
"I know that, my, dear child. It'is no Â¦
eecret I have to tell. Mrs.' O'Hagan, how-;
ever, had best leave the room far a mln :
w* wrtwn." _ - Â¦...-- ;,;.:Â¦-:Â¦:- .
"Very well," said Zella, her hand on her
heart. Â¦
-Bridget, looking first at Storev and then
at Zella, crept. out of the room. :Â¦Â¦
"Bo seated, my dear child." said Storey.
It might have been best for my. wfie to
have come to you; she will later; but we
know each other better, do we not?"
"Yes," ehs said, looking at him. her lips
parted with fear, all the color, gone from
her face. v ' Â¦'Â¦Â¦'Â¦
*'I want you to be very brave,"
"Yes," she said, mechanically.
"You are one of the. bravest, indeed,
the bravest little women ; I, -know: -There
are times when we need the command of
all our fortitude and the support of re
ligion." ...
"Oh, my God! What is it?" she said,
clutching both arms of the chair.
"Bad news, my child; bad news. I
hardly know how to teil you."
"It is about Ned? I know what It is.
Oh. my God! W r hat shall I do? What
shall 1 do?"
To the relief of Storey, she burst into*
a passionate flood of tears, an'd, burying
her face in her hands, . sobbed as if her
heart would break. Â¦ - . -. Â¦
Bridget, who had "lingered by the door,
trembling so that her teeth- chattered in
her head, crept back, and. with her hana
upon Zella's head, stood between her and
Storey, without beint able to utter a
word. -
"Don't speak to her, Mistress O'Hagan;
It will do her good to cry. 1 was afraid
Bhe would not take it in that way. â¢ Na
ture's kind, when It gives to sorrow the
relief. of tears." " ..
is it?" Bridget tried t,o say, but
her mouth was dry and she could not ar
ticulate. â¢
"Our dear Ned Glover," said Storey, "he
has met with an accident.' '
"He's dead?" said Bridget, with a cry.
Storey bowed his head.
The poor old woman could not bear the
shock of this confirmation of her fears.
She fell prone at Zella's feet. Storey
raised her up and, placing her on a chair,
rang the bell.
The cook, who was just going out for
the evening, came into the room. She
was passing, the door when the bell rang.
"We've had bad news, - and your mis
tress, I fear, has fainted," said Storey.
"Perhaps a little water or a little brandy
might be useful."
While the cook administered restora
tives to Bridget. Storey stood by the chair
where Zella continued overcome with
grief.
"Can you carry Mistress O'Hagan to
her room?" Storey asked. -
"That can I." 'was the quick reply, and
the devoted old servant lifted Bridget In
her arms as if her burden had been an
In (ant and carried her away. \
Zella awoke from what might have been
a long trance, so dazed was she. so altered,
so aloof from all the world and yet -with
such a keen, inquiring expression In hÂ«;r
eyes. The shock of the change in Zella' sÂ»
appearance, the pity of it, the appealing
aspect of the whole figure, brought* tears
into the strong man's eyes, though the
thought passed through his mind by way
of consolation that people who feel most
keenly recover the soonest. He 6at down
by the girl's. side and took her hand. It
lay in his limp as if it might have been
the land of one dead.
"You know me. Miss Brunnen?" he said;
She moved her head and dropped her
eyes, the lids still wet with tears, her
bosom agitated with sobs.
"It ie common for the messenger of ill
tidingrs to excite dislike; but I hope you
will not hate me for the sake of the love
I bore him."
She responded with the slightest pos
sible pressure of her hand.
"I hope I may be of some servlceÂ»to Vou.*
You must bear up. I am not going to tell
you that it was God's will or to advise
you to seek consolation in this or that.
Nothing can console you at present. Oniy,
for the sake of your friends, try and bear
your sorrow -with courage. If you give
way you will lose your/ health and
strength, and you â¢will need both." '
"I ought to have known." she said, with
every word a subdued sob. "that my hap
piness was too great to last; Don't tell
me your message. I read it in your face
the moment you spoke to me. I know
that he is dead. My dear, dear Ned!"
And saying so, she broke down in such
a renewed passion Â©f sobs that Storey
was alarmed, lest she might die of her
grief.
"My dear child," he said, "be calm.
Try. dear soul; don't give way so, my
poor child*" And so on, .and presently
she grew calmer, and came out of the at
tack, but weak and helpless. . . "
"Don't mind me," she 6ald; and her
voice seemed to come from a distance, as
if some one else, not herself, were speak
ing. "I can't help it. I. am trying."
Storey had had many a hard task In the
course of his life, but never had suffered
such a tax upon his feelings. He found
it difficult to suppress an exhibition of his
emotions.
"You will need all your fortitude; but
you are well endowedâ the daughter of a
soldier. Life, -you know, is only a battle,
after all; and we do not all come out of
a campaign alive. It is consoling to know
that our dear ones have deserved well 'of
their country. Our, dear Ned was one of
the most lovable." !
"Was!" she said, i "Was! Oh; my God!
Was! Give me air! I shall suffocate!
Was! Was!"
She staggered to her feet. He put his
arm about her. and led her to the win
dow, which he opened. Her eyes were
sunken, her cheeks ashy pale, her lipa
had the hue of death. The fresh air blew
upon her face, j Storey unbuttoned the
top button of her dress at the neck, and
blew into her face, as he had seen a mes
merist do to bring baclf asubject to con
sciousness. She revived. '
"Tharik you," she said, presently; "I'm
better. Thank you. i Let me move about."
He removed hi3 . arm from her waist,
and took her hand.
"I shall send my wife to you," he said,
tenderly. "But 1 thought I might be a
check upon your grief; that a man's
strength might inspire . your fortitude.
That's better; you are your noble father's
daughter. Have. courage. That's better!"
"Thank you," she said; and drew out a
handkerchief and wiped her face.
"Let me advise you to take a little
brandy, eh?"
"No, thank you. Where is Bridget?" 'Â¦"
"She has gone" to her room. She will
come down presently." 1 .'
"She knows?"
"Yes."
"It will break her heart. Mine is broken.
Tell me how it happened." .
"Not "now. Mrs. Storey shall come and
tell you." Â¦
"I don't want her. Tell me how it hap
pened."
"Can you bear it?" . li'.C/'V''
"My love Is dead, and yet I live," she
said. "My heart is. broken; God has oB
serted me; my .prayers have all gone for
naught. What else can touch me?" .
She was nerving herself to meet, with
the fortitude of depair, whatever there
might be to tell; and Storey began to
think it would be best to tell her. all. :
"He is dead?" she said,, tightening her
lips and pressing her hand upon- her
heart. . â¢ ' ;
"And buried," Storey said.
â¢ "With Christian j burial?" ; sho > asked,
adding in an almost cynical . tone, '"but

AS A YOUNG MAN. ZELLA CALLS
Â¦Â¦Ji .HERSELF PHILIP GREY.
Zella. for the time b:ing. almost forget
ting her sorrow In the. success of her ex
periment, thrust her hands into her pock
ets and, as the commonplace young man,
strode defiantly -on her way back to the
city.* She. had read In Emerson- how he
hadfoundthe Englishman to be him. of
all men. who stands-: firmest In his shoes.
Glover had presented her'wit.. Emerson's
works-and had commended to-her more
particularly the "English Traits." This
was a bit of national vanity, which Ze'.Ia
had suspected; for she knew that the un
meaning jibes : of. poor Bridget O'llagan
now and then rankled in his mind. Ned
was. not a strong man, as we have seen;
but he was a lovable follow. Weak men
are often more lovable than men of stror.y
character. .Emerson had taught^Zella a
good deal. Some English" peop^4 know
more about American authors thin Amer
icans themselves; and, in not a fev.- in
stances, it has been left for America to
pioneer some of the most eminent of Eng
lish authors. Zella. had dwelt upon what
Emerson said about concentration as the
secret of strength in all management of
human affairs; ?o she focused her mind
upon the mission she had laiddown for
herself, and stood firm In her shoes.

Here' the cook < and Mr. Glencoe wero
fussy about the call of the shipping clerk.
Glencoe hoped. If she really was going
to Europe, she might find it convenient to
employ the young, fellow's firm. He
seemed a most agreeable young man, and
he whistled "Auld Lang Syne."
-As the shipping clerk, Zella had bought
a complete outfit of clothes, suitable for
a young fellow who mlsht be seeking his
fortune as a minerâ most of them sec
ond-hand; none of them expensive. These
had -been delivered, in a' heavy handbag,
to Philip Grey. at the Grand Pacific. It is
hardly necessary to say that, although
for two niehts the assumed male guest.
Mr. Philip Grey, had a room at the hotel,
he had not slept there. On the third day
he packed a trunk and had it dispatched
to the Mountain "Hotel, Denver; where
Ned had stayed, on his way to Red Horse
Forks and Platts Valley. - Zella wrote, on
the Grand Pacific note paper, requesting
the manager -to takf care of the trunk
until her arrival. .She hoped to follow
It in a day or two. Of course, she wrote
as Philip Grey and liavlns seen her trunk
on an express -wagon, she went home, as
Zella Brunnen. â¢ Â¦
;-Â¦ She .whistled a snatch of "Auld Lang
Syne 'as she sauntered down the pathi to
the roadway. Old Glencoe, 'catching the
famlllar'and much-loved strain, TemarkeU
to himself, "That's Just a verra genteel
young man",; and retired to his own room;
thinking of the last time he had sung the
rational song in unison with the entire
household at Parkside. on the night be
fore poor Ned Glover left for Platts Val
ley. "Eh. but the poor lassie is hard hit."
he said to himself , as he .took up 'Â¦Â¦ for the
twentieth -time the mapiupon which he
had marked out the poor, fellow's route
from Chicago to his fatal ' destination.
"There it is," he said, brushing from the
mounted sheet the ; escaped dust of a
heavy pinch of snuff ; "Chicago, St. Louis,
Kansas City. Denver, St. Lawrence; To
peka. Kit Carson and then'into the wilds,
so to speak. Not that Kit Carson, Is too

Forks, and from Red: Horse Forks, this

the card of the agents with. whom she had
already:* been in communication. -In-pre

had, .as nearly as possible, imitated the
voice, and manner of one of the clerks at
the shipping office.; â

Glencoe as Zella took up \ her soft hat,
with a bow and "I thank you sir."
:AH 1 can aay, young man, is that she

ZELLA BRUNNEN'SJ EXPERIMENT,
CHAPTER XXVI1T.
The story; of- Ned Glover's death vraÂ«,
after all, only a passing incident of the
Mail's varied -and ; = exciting. : news. Ned
Glover's colleagues on the nress werr not
sufficiently intimate with him to make his
loss, an occasion for special mourning.
One or two of. them had, indeed, resented
his success; and more than, one or two
what they regarded as his superior:alrs.
On^tho whole, however, he 1 stood Â¦ fairly
well with them, and in Mr. Storey's esti
mation his accession to the Mail staff had
*Â£ n - Kreat importance and his career
full of promise. But with the reshuffling
of the cards in the editorial room and the
burning- questions of thedav to occupy
the staff and the reading public, the death
of Ned Glover was a mere drop in-th<Â»
ocean of news, >. a fact which enabled
Zella to carry out her adventurous
scheme with creator faoMUv than if the
tragedy of Blind Man's Drift had been a
matter of national importance. V â¢ -
. Having, as she believed, placed the af
fairs of Mrs. Bridget O'Hagan. in a fair
way- for -thelr'.proper administration (the
doctors believed the old lady would re
cover),' she set about the preliminary
equipment of herself, mentally and physi
cally, for her scheme of vengeance. The
boarding-house marveled that Zella could
take her loss so phllosephically, that she
could talk about it and contemplate a
business visit to Ix)ndon in connection
with, the dead Englishman's will and
other- personal matters. ' Old " Glencoe
thought the poor girl just a wee bit de
mented; sometimes, he said, grief took
that. aspect. Storey thought her eccenÂ«
trie; but, he said, she. had been brought
up amidst skirmishing and hard fighting,
too, on the Indian frontier,- and death
In its most violent form was not un
familiar to her. Â¦ â¢Â¦Â¦â¢ â¢ But then he con
fessed that, young as she was at the
time, the death of her father. had nearly
broken her heart; and that he had-wit
nessed no exhibition of grief so Intense
as Zella's' when he brought her the sad
tidings of Glover's death. He concluded
that she \ was hiding her feelings under
a cloak, of philosophic resignation; in
which he was confirmed by the' pallor of
her cheeks and the dark hollows about
her eyes. ' â¢ Â¦Â¦Â¦'Â¦Â¦ : " . . . -
Having convinced herself that, so far as
she was concerned, and the "possibility of
justice being done. in regard to the death
of her lover, the incident was considered
to be closed, Zella allowed her original in
eplration of vengeance to develop. That
it might- be the easier for her, - she set
about making open preparations to visit
Europe.' Not that had no intention
of carrying! them out, but first she in
tended, to go to' Blind Man's Drift. Her
mission thither being ended, she would
betake herself to London and fulfill the
wishes of her dear dead. She cared noth
ing for the â¢ money value of the position.
She would have started for Europe with
a very slender purse, to fulfill the slight
est desire Ned might have expressed. Had
he lived she- would have been his wife;
now that he was no more, she would love
and venerate his memory as if she were
Indeed his widow. And first, she - would
begin by. avenging him. To that purpose
certain : secret, and public preparations
were necessary.
On the other hand, Mr.' Storey . had
promptly sent out one of his cleverest re
porters to the scene of Glover's death, at
the same time giving him Instructions to
consider himself Miss Brunnen' s repre
sentative.- The lawyers of the Mali,* whose
services Zella had accepted, also intrusted
the reporter with a commission to gather
for them all necessary information con
cerning Glover's affairs, his alleged will,
and every thing they considered necessary
in the interest of Miss Brunnen and that
of the Mail.
Zella urged that Blind Man's Drift, ac
cording to the maps, was only a hundred
miles from the Red Horse Forks, which
was little more than two days' ride. by the
stage from Kit Carson" or thereabouts;
surely that brought the district within po
lice jurisdiction? ; That was so, they said,
if Intervention was .called . for in a big
way; buÂ£ , not in' regard to minor 'Â¦ occur
rences; and, moreover, if it were other-'
wise, the Drift was altogether beyond the
ken of Chicago. <
Of course," she might employ a detec
tive; but they assured her that his ser
vices could be of no possible vaiue in such
a case. In districts like Platts Valley,
the Ridge and Blind Man's Drift it. was
not so much the distance in miles as the
character -of .the country, and the new
mining region was a wnd, unoccuplea and
vast extent of mountain, forest and ra
vine, with no proper settlements, and
stretching away into comparative blanks
on the map, as the young iady would per
ceive. If they exaggerated the outlook
somewhat, it was only to emphasize the
fact that she. could obtain no assist
ance from the authorities.
Â¦ They did not know Zella. >i Bhe hkrdly
knew herself. -With a sudden and strkngo
resolution ' in : her mind," that : contemplated
the :avenglng;of j her v lover's death, she,
nevertheless,-* with ; diplomatic aptitude,
gave herself a margin- of other chances.*-,
. She interviewed , the police. Unhappily
Joe Williams was still abroad. The chiefs
told her, .. and Mr." "Storey indorsed their
point or view, that the case dldnot^call
for their Intervention. Had' it been one of
murder, with malice prepense, they might
have taken a hand in bringing the culprit
to justice. -Even if it had assumed - tho
character iof. an ordinary shooting they
might,. in' deference to Mr.' Storey's 're
gard' for. the man and the Influence of the
Mall.; have -sent a 1 posse over to"; Blind
Man's Drift; but the encounter .appeared
to have been conducted on: the. legitimate
and recognized lines of the'duello, with
seconds, referee or umpire, and all the
otht-r safeguards, the aifair taking place
in presence of the camp. In such a com
munity., outside the paie of civilization a3

IN MALE ATTIRETHOSE four bears that I killed e:t tlw
divide between the Fraser and the
ocean just saved my life. '~':'\ r ~.
It Is true that they nearly killc-1
me- in the first place acd laid roe uo .t
cripple in the Canadian woods for three
â¢months, but if I had not had them to
cat I should have died ot starvation where
I *ay, for traveling was out of the ques
tion. ,.;..'.-7;.,
1 left Vancouver in the latter part of
July, taking with me the lightest sort of
an outlit, and barely inough provisions to
t toe a week. A heavy coat and nay
regular clothing was all the protection I
tiad from the weather. A bag of food con
taining flour, coffee, bacon, hardtack.
Migar: and a heavy /evolver tor defense.
comprised the balance of my outtit.
The resion to which I Intended go:n<j
had been reported as showing rkh placer
prospects and some tine float rock had
been brought in by a -aimer who gave me
â¢ the- exact location in which he picked it up
1 via* BuffSrtrnHy fiiiniliar with the region
to recognize his dt^criction and by tie
rough and unworn condition of the roc*
I knew that he must have found it cla-se
to the original lodge from which it came.
â¢ ror that reason 1 thought it was better
lor me to make the trip alone, as thers
vould be one less mouth to keep closed
â¢ unUl I could make the necessary investi
gations and arrange tor filing the claims.
i>iy first day's journey v.as a hard on-j,
as it w;.s alniuet continuous uphill work,
my intention being to get up in the highoi*
ndgts, where there was less Umber iu
the way of traveling, and as the rocks
wore more exposed and less covered with
Cftritus tfa<rÂ« was .-ilso a better chance
of making tome- discoveries I y the way.
The tecond day l made very much bel
ter time, for it was nearly all* level going,
3usi tiious-U of up and down to rest my
leg.-- with the variety. There was no brush
in the way; on the contrary, there seemed
. to be on the very top of the divide a regu
lar trail, which had probably been worn
f'V wild animals, as I was far away from
paths of travelers and there were no cat
. tie In that reprion.
I made camp somewhat early In the
bead of a little ravine below the too
nf the ridge. It was an Ideal spot, shel
tered from the wind. A small stream tum
bled over a fall at the upper
Â¦end of the fiat and fell again
fis it loft the lower end. so I
Â¦W3S in a way shut in. as there were *tet?D,
rorky walls on the sides. With my hunt
ing knife, which was heavy as a machete.
I cut four pronged saplings, stuck them
In the gTound. put two poles In the
crotches lengthwise, laid fnme springy
nmbs across the poles, and had Uv
Inundation of a very good cot to keep me
ctt the ground.
After cooking my tupper I stowed my
â¢provisions under the bunk to keep the
<-!ew off them, built a good big fire and
l.ny down to enjoy a smcke. It was some
v. hnt cold, being held up with a free draft.
cf air circulating uiiuer me, but I was
tired and soon went U> sleep.
It was not long before the cold awoke
me and from then until nearly morning I
â¢/pent my time huddling myself together
end shivering. About dawn I fell soundly
asleep and from my wakeful night leav
ing: me so weary I must have been in a.
rrjrular trance, for I remember half wak
ing up and dreaming that I was swinging
in a hammock and that a large number
of pigs were* running around playing tag.
A heavy Joit nearly threw me off my
bunk. I awoke with a start and heard
. a frightful "woosh: woosh!" right under
me.
Threfl bij? bears were sniffing at my bed
and one smaller one was rooting around
Â¦under It trying to get the provisions out
cf the sack.
. A Mow with the barrel of my pistol on
the back of the small bear under the
bunk made him jump back and snap *Â»t
me with another "woosh. woosh." l!ko
the noise made by a frightened hog. As
he retreated a little way I got hold of tha
V>sg of provisions, â¢which â¢was all wet on
â¢ the ouiFirte from hi? having mauled It
mund with his mouth. Taking It In my
left hand nnd my pistol In my richt r
barked carefully away up the little gion
under the impression that the bears
v.ouid leave me alone, but as soon as I
tried to climb the steep, rocky path oy
which I h3d descended their appetite*
feemefl to get the better of their man
Â¦Rfrsar.d they came after me, the little
one first of all.
I think if it had not beon for the fool
ishness of that little bear the rest
of them misrht have gone away, but It
rr-emed to havÂ« no fear a*Sd one of the
bi-=r nnes**. which was its mother, followed
it up jrrowling. evidently intending that
lio harm Fhould come to it.
"Cross as a bear" means something. It
if not a mere empty expression. I real-
Jzrd that when I was being bullied
e round by those bears, not darinij to run,
not wishing to shoot for fear of precipl
titir.g an unnecessary conflict.
T knew that an old bear with a cub
â¢was thÂ» worst of all kinds to handle, for
they arc quicker, crosser and meaner thin
sry other kind, so while the cub was
bothering- me the most I determined to
try to kill the o!d one first. I did not
know all about bears, but I knew enough
cf them to realize that there was no use
rhoniing at their beads, which as a rul?
only makes them angry -without hurting
th<*-m. unless struck in the mouth or eyts.
My hand was not any too steady, so I
â¢could not do thK but I did get a bullet
'.n about where I wanted it between the
Tif'k r. nd shoulder.
ThÂ«-- rÂ«T**ort of the pistol and th* srrowl
<-.f Th<-> wounded bear diverted attention
for a minut? and cave me a chance to
p?t un on the. hillside and replace the ex
ploded empty cartridge with another:
sIfo to rnpty ray oartridsre box into my
fTket. where I could get at the car-'
trifipep easily.
The wounded bear had recovered from
T-iÂ«*t chork and came for me. but with
r>rn* 1aTf\pz unless. I had Just time to
finish p-ettinp the pistol closed, -when the
Two other Inrge bears started as well. I
pot a bullet Into one of them somewhere,
that dropped his hind legs -useless and he
nrfr.i rii-aprc-l ntr himself by his forel*>KÂ».
Only the third bear -was now too close
for combat.
How I did it I flo not know, hut for some
time I managed to flr around over the
Kides of what was almost a cliff. Bound
end tovai the vallev. Jumping from ledee
to lrdrp. up PM side. acros3 the slippery
Jiead Where the water trickling over the
rocks made them elimy and mossy, then
dnrn the other ride, across the foot of
the <2p11 and up again. It was a regular
race between us and Just at this nnint
Trhere I wert.down to cross the side of
the canyon, the bear gained on me every
tine. While I could ed alonsr the side
â¢hill fartT. he -was much quicker and
more carelep? in his way of rolling down
h\\\. I tried wreraJ shots at him. each of
which took effect, as was shown by !n
crejrsnd pnarllngs find a way that he had
of biting, at the place where the wound
wriR made, as though some living thing
had bitten him there and he wished to
caicJi it with his teeth. I had now but
cne shot l'jft in my pistol and no time to
j>ut in more, for the bear was close upon
In trying to hurry and gain time I
rtunbicd a? I went down the side of the
canyon to cross the foot of the flat and
Â»Â»efore I could ret up the bear was on
ne trcth and claw* all at once. In his
rape he fortunately missed my hands.
1 cocked the plctol, pressed it to his side
Â¦
The most thankful moment of my lif*
was when, approaching the coast with the
last of my provisions gone and nearly
ready to drop and die. I heard the bark
ing of dogs at an Indian camp on an
inlet.
Those Indians were full of the kind of
charity that counts. From the little that
they had they gave me all 1 needed.
One of mem. an' old hunter, had once
been caught in almost the satne way that
Many a time, overturned by my scanty
pack. I fell to the ground from pain and,
weakness, and then, unable to rise but
driven on by will power atone. I would
crawl and drag myself forward with my
hands. In me sanÂ» way that the bear
with the broken back had Â«1one.
I should have been tempted to cut It eft.
for It seemed Impossible that It could r?*"
. heal. Still the worst was over; it could
not hurt any more than it did then."
That was a consolation for me. I began
to feel quite cheerful over the thought,
and started In to make plans for the fix
ture. One thing that, struck me very forci
bly was that I should have to eat many
a meal before I would be well enough to
get away, if ever. And. fortunately, thera
was a fine supply of meat at hand.
Better, still, there were bearskin robes
to keep my 'wounded body warm, and.
. best of ali perhaps, there was bear's
grease in plenty to use as an ointment to
heal the hurts the bears themselves had
made.
It was a good illustration of being cured
by a "hair of the dog that bit you."
The tirst thing I did was to sharpen ray
knife well on a piece of gritty rock by the
. water. Then I dragged myself over to tha
closest bear.
I got one-half of the bear skinned very
nicely. Then came the awful work of roll
ing him over on his stretched out hide
so that I could skin the other side. Again
and again I tried, and thought each timo
that I shculd die in the attempt. Fortu
nately it was a trifle down hill, antt at last
I got him over. After that it was easier
work. . I began cutting the meat oft
In strips ana laying them on the hide.
The tag of provisions was not far away.
From it I took salt and pepper, of which
1 had fortunately brought more than was
required. 1 mixed up some together and
rubbed the mixture on the strips of meat.
"When I had a number prepared I hung:
them on a stick and laid it across on two
ro< ks to dry- The? work was getting Inter
esting new, ami I commenced to feel Hka
a sort of a second Robinson Cruaoe. only
tftat I was much more handicapped, for
he had the entire resources of a largo
tropical island at his command, and I had, 1
hut one small rocky dell. He had tha
cargo of a freighted ship for stores. I
had three dead beats and a smalt hand
sack of provisions. He was whole and
strong: I was maimed and half-dead.
Fortunately for trie there were large
quantities of i'owii timber on the little,
flat, and if took but little exertion to get
it.
Having demonstrated to myself that
there was to be no danger of starving, t
prepared an . unusually good supper ot
broiled bear's meat, biscuit and coffee,
after which, -lighting: my pipe. I set to
work to tan the bearskin by rubbing It
with grease ami smoking it over the flre.
Although not completely tanned, it mada
a welcome addition to my covering that
night.
The next day I began with more enthu
siasm than I should have believed possi
ble at my work of butcher shop and tan
nery. I dressed the remaining two bears,
so that they would keep until I could get
to them to cut up the meat. From the*
intestines 1 prepared some fine catgut
strings, to use in snaring birds In case I
should need to do so.
When I had finally completed cutting up>
the meat I had an easier time vrlth my
work, which was simply to smoke it and
do my own cooking.
Ft was fortunate that I had been com
pelled to such painful activity during thÂ»
time that I was first wounded, for it gava
the injured muscles and tendons tha
stretching which they needed, and I think
' it is to that and the large amount of fresh
air I had that I. ewe my recovery.
It w.-is slow and painful at best, for
while the exercise had helped the muscles
it had not helped the bones any. and they
knitted more slowly than they would have
done had I been able to give them thÂ«
required rest.
For two and a half months I lived on
the meat of those bears and the carefnlljr
economized provisions which I had with
me. I then realized that, although I was
unable to safely risk the long trip which
I must make to get to the coast, the In
creasing cold weather promised a snow
fall, which might bury me for the winter
and forever.
How far or how fast I could travel I
had no Idea. It was then necessary for
me to take all of my small stock of food
and my bearskin robes as well, for with
out them the cold frosty nights would
have chilled me to death.
/ The pack was not a heavy one for a
strong man, but for me It was a moun
tain. How I ever made the distance to
the Indian village on the coast I cannot
tell. It seems to me now a miracle. In
miles I do not know the distance, but in
steps tt was hundreds of thousands, and
each of them, short and halting though
it was; cost me more pain than I like to
remember.

And hera I am.THE SUNDAY CALL.
KRIS CRINGLE is going to outdo
blzsself this season. More novel
tics in toys are on the market
. than at any otKer season In years.
The general prosperity of the country is
reflected in the variety and costliness of
these gifts. Doll houses with electric
lights, baths of running water, electric
call bell? an.i the like run up to $150 this
year, nnd there ar* cinematographs and
mechanical music box figures that reach
three fijrures in price, too. ..
To show the boom in the toy market It
.Is only necessary to glance at the Imports
during the la^t few months. One estab
lishment alone brought in $s:iO,OiX) worth.
Yet each year sees Uncle Sam less de
pendent upon the Nuremberg. Paris, Vi
enna and other foreign toy makers, as
mechanic? in this courtry are fast acquir
ing the ir-grcnuHy and deftness essential
to clever tcy manufacture. The toy bus
iness cf Amerira amounts to millions of
dollars annually. Many thousands are
engaged in it, and Yankee versatility is
never shown to greater advantage in a
rmall matter, at least, tha'n in the re
markable way sowing machines, upright
and horizontal steam engines, cinemato
gTaphs=. theaters, dolls, locomotives, forts
and fclf-propolk-d boats are imitated in
loyland.
A s=trcll through the big warerooms of
a rr.p.r.ufaetur'-r and importer of these

Some I'M varieties cf dells, costing from

A mechanical animal outfit that drawn
"ohs" and "ahs" from all the youngsters
who are fortunate enough, to Eee It La ja.
In the animal line crouching lions, ram
pant tigers, Pomeranian dogs, elephants,
woolly sheep and mooley cows that can be
milked are shown, with great fidelity to
nature. Their skins are for the most part
real fur or skin, and all have what the
toyman calls "natural voices." As a mat
ter of fact, a turn of the cow's head does
evoke a familiar "moo," and the- lion
makes a startling roar when a ring under
his threat is pulled. Simultaneously his
tail twitches frcm side to side and alto-'

work Is done by the cottagers in their own
homes, and every Saturday Tjight the
week's* output Is turned in at the factory
which is little; more than a receiving ano!
shipping bureau. â¢ -"Â¦---..
r One is i Inclined to envy such a vlllaee
andjmaglne the Inhabitants to-be a lov

Is that toyjnaking Isfa. most prosaic busi

: A. combination pool table and parlor re
turn pool set Is another popular offering.
This Is a regular fifteen-ball, six-pocket
affair, with triangle for setting 'em up,
cues, etc! The ancient diversion of throw
ing balls at the dodging Ethiopian is now
transposed to Toyland, and may be played
In winter as well as in summer. A ball is
thrown from a cup, like a pigeon trap
against the wooden figures in a frame
like a tent. =.The manikins are numbered,
and the game goes to the one who hits
the higher numbered ones most fre
quently. , \
suasion,* for it really .will do practical
plain sewing. To all intents It is a. small
sized regulation sewing machine, about
a foot hi-gh. It can be clamped to the
edge of a -table/ and 13 very stronsly
made. It has the latest patent feed mo
tion, a perfect stitch regulator and a self
setting j^ieedle. with a short blade and a
lohg shank.' It weighs sixteen ounces and
sells for about $3.
TVajrons and- cars are made In much the
same way, except that wheels have to be
put on by hand. Hundreds of women and
men do nothing else from eight in thÂ»
morning until six at night but fasten
small wheels on tin wagons and locomo
tives. Others spend their daylight hours
in fastening little tin candlesticks to their
bases, the same candlesticks to be used
In Christmas tree decorations. Ameri
cans are taking away that industry, how.
ever from- the German and Swiss work
men these last few years. Most of thÂ»
cotton wool angels, stars of Bethlehem,
colored glass balls and bright tinsels with
which the trees are beautified are made
In the busy wholesale streets of New
\ork. even If they do come In boxes la
beled "maae in Germany."
Toy making Is not a profession which
calls for a great amount of srray matter
on the part of the worker. Neither does
it In this country, where, expensive toys
are not manufactured, require any parti
cular skill. Deft fingers and rapid execu
tion are the main thlr.gs. The workera
labor from seven or eight o'clock In the
morning until six at night. They are not
pair! weekly wages, but by the piece.
Their earnings . average from fifty cents
to Jl ".0 a day, according to the difficulties
of their several tnska. The girl who
paints ' the tuiws" cheeks makes seventy
five cents a day, and the man who does
the "-wheeling" makes twice that sura.'
Stringing drums pays the laborers about
.fifty, cents, painting clowns fifty and
painting horses *i- Especially difficult
work, cf course, pays better. Small a-Â»
the- wage seems, it is far better than tha
German and Swiss work people are able
to earn for a much higher class of labor.
In the -years to come, when our toy in
dustry really develops, we may have a
large Immisration from the toymaklng
villages. Perhirs we shall see certain
small towns in New Jersey turned over
'to the toy makers. It certainly seems
worth some' capitalist's experiment. No
matter how great the financial depression
people always buy a certain amount of
toys at the Christmas season, and. Indeed
at all other times of the year. Toys are
real necessities of life as a matter of
fact. "Without them a child's life Is hard
ly lived at all. It is pleasant to know that
very few little ones are required to go
without Christmas presents, even If they

tin kitchen is built almost entirely by ma
chinery. First the flat sheet of tin is
run through a- machine which puts on
a flat color, red or green or magenta,
whatever the prevalUng tone is to be.
Then comes the embossing, and afterward
the sheet, still flat, goes through a third
machine, which paints only the embossed
places. The kitchens are next cut out
and shaped, and the stove and range iJ

by machinery. The next stape Is the
painting of the range and other details.

girls and .women.

The cheapest automobile sells for 55; the
better ones readily fetch $10.'
Electricity^ is adapted to the toy thea
ters, too-, nowadays. The footlights are
tiny electric bulbs. The call bell in the
prompter's box Is art' electric one, and
variously the new adjunct Is made ser
viceable for the little folk. A theater two
feet high, with two curtains, three com
plete: sets of scenes, including "wings,"
"flies," etc., and characters for a popular
' five-act^ play sells for $26 50. Less elabo
rate thedters are sold as cheap as $3 50.
A tandem outfit that sells, for $42 con
sists of a go-cart of polished ash, seats
with russet leather cushions, two horses
as big- as Shetland ponies, mounted on
platforms with wheels at the corners, har
nessed as the regulations of the swell
Metropolitan Tandem^ Club set forth, and
a scat behind for a footman.
A hand power toy sewing machine al
â¢&ays interests tho&e'bf the feminine per-
dark btit mold y*raty heads. To others is
given the task cf cutting out and sewing
up the muslin bodies. Still others stuff
and complete the bodies, paint the faces,
fasten on the hair, set in the eyes and
make the clothes. The very expert are
permitted to handle fine dolls, whose hair
and eyebrows are actually set In the wax.
The Christmas doll, like the Christmas
poem and the Christmas story, begins its
existence somewhat in advance of the tea
son. May, June, July and August are the
busy months in the- factories, and travel
ing salesmen start out with their samples
about the time when the retail shop* are
selling firecrackers.
The task of putting on the doll's com
plexion Is Intrusted to girls, as a rule, the
theory being that they have a hereditary
talent in that direction. One girl paints
the generaj flesh tone, and another puts
the rcses of health on the cheeks. Still
another outlines the Cupid's bow of a
mouth, without which a doll wouid be no
doll at all. There Is some real artistic
taste exercised In this decorative process.
The shade of the cheeks must tone exact
ly with the n?sh color. The least deviation
wouid be noticeable. Nothing remain* to
complete the head but to glue on the wig.
The arms and legs are built in much the
same way, except that less care is be
stowed upon them. Finally all the mem
bers are turned over to the finishers. Bar
rels and baskets of dissected dolls, sug
gesting heathen massacres or surgical
wards of a hospital, fill the finishers*
rooms. Men and women work with amaz
ing rapidity fastening the dolls together
and laying them in baskets to be sent to
the dresser.
"We make comparatively few Iron toyÂ»
In this country as yet, but our tin and
wooden productions lead the market. The
rise In the price cf iron has given the tin

followers, and to show their strength the
funeral w!ll be imposing enough to be a
terror to their adversaries, as veil as an
honor to their chief. It is about to take
place; come and attend.
Not from morbid curiosity, for mor
bidity relates only to the sad and gru?
fomp. A Chinere funeral Is none of that.
It is merrier than a wedding,, for a soul
is starting on its tour to the fairy isles
cf the Eastern Seas.
To see it properly you must see it all â
not only the part im? public witness* Â¦;.
but the chamber of death as well; for
like everything else that the Confucians
do. it is complete, beginning with the
body on its deathbed and lasting until the
personal belongings of the deceased have
been destroyed in the sacrificial fires aivl
the mourning garments of those who at
tend have been cast in the same flamss.
In everything the Oriental reverses the
Western customs. We try to die at home
in bed. Relatives work to prolong cur
useless lives, when hope and joy of life
have fled. The Chinaman feels that ho
must not die in the house; that would be
bad form. He, knowing that his <?nd is
near, hastens it, to relieve the feelings of
his relatives, friends and servants. Leav
ing his home In a carriage or litter, at
tended by friends, If well-to-do, or, if"
poor, alone and on foot, he gc#s to the
Onhing fong (place of tranquillity), the
lethaJ chamber which Is an adjunct of ev
ery Chinese undertakers establishment.
Here he lays him down with a will to
die, and if his will Is not enough the ar's
of the undertaker assist in bringing tha
end, which Is in no event delayed by tha
nourishing food, stimulants and restora
tives with which we prolong the death
agony to the greatest possible extension.
If the nne about to die has more mean*
than ordinary he may secure special
chambers instead of those furnished
gratis to the expiring public by th? fu
neral director; but the object is in all
cases the Fame â to spare the feelings of
the living, enabling them to avoid the
thoughts that arise from knowing that
there is a dead body in the house and
putting the stigma, upon the chamber
itself. How many a time have our
nights been turned Into blank terror
Â¦wnen, as children, we were put to sleep
In "the room that Uncle John died In."
Do not take off your hat at the funeral.
That is not according to the way of the
Taoists. But you may. shake hands with
tne corpse. In the Chinese manner, of
course, by claeplng your own hands and
shaking them cordially in front of you,
bowing et the same time to the person ad
dressed. It is a r.lcer method; at times
much more reserved.
To bÂ«>pin early, we will go to the Cham
ber cf Tranquillity.

ered, face and all, with light draperies.

from the evil spirits who flock about
when a eoul is abcul to take its departure.
For the Chinese believe that small holes

ing to evil spirits. Small holes they have
to interminably crawl throush and right
angles deter them on their way.
The Tao Sze. Taoist priest of the Golden
Hose, comes Into the room carrying a
pott-toned gor.g from the temple- With
him is the chul-lek kci-yan (musician;,
with a trurapc't-fhaped flageolet.
The priest inclines his head toward the
body until the golden rose on his cap falls
fcrward and points with its crimson
tipped petals toward tha lifeless form.
Then nÂ» softly strikes his gong and
pitching his voice in unison with It be
gins a song tender and sad as that of a
vounc mother finding her hrst horn to
sleep. It is the lullaby of the departing
FPirtt but different from the cradle Â«ong
cf the child, for In that a woman la calm
*SÂ» her babe to a icst from which it will

spirit is being soothed into the oblivion
that will never wake, but ends in the
Nirvana, from which all things came.
* As a spirit storm-swept would swirl and
swing through the dark,, so the music
j-triv's and reaches, sinks to whispers no
soft as not to wake a sleeper of the liv
ing, and then rices to shrieking height*
as though it. would wake the dead.
But alwavs, whether the instruments be
playing loud or soft, the voice of thÂ©

A Deluge predicted a for 1901
ON. one of the famous Babylonian
tablets appears an inscription of
surpassing interest, the full import
of which has only now. become
manifest. And yet the Inscription simply
informs us that Capricorn was the ruling
sign in the zodiac at the time of" the
delugeâ not a startling statement In ftnelf,
nor one likely, to attract much attention
from antiquarians - and archaeologists.
Quite recently, however, a copy of the in
scription fell Jnto the ! hands of an Ori
ental scholar in London, who is also an
amateur astronomer and astrologer of no
mean repute, and he; at once saw that a
wide field for speculation was here opened
to him, the enigma to be solved being the
Question: In view .of the fact that a great
deluge occurred when Capricorn was the
ruling sign in the zodiac," all the planets
being congregated in this sign at the time,
is it reasonable to expect that another
deluge- will occur when the zodiacal con
ditions arc similar? .'l,; 5 " -
..Within a few days every, noted occultist
and astronomer in England had heard of
the strange inscription, and * ever \ since
they have -been pondering over it; .i: The
data which they have to guide them to
ward a solution; of the problem are few
but important* 'To quote Dr.' Frank Close,
late president of the Tacoma Academy of
Sciences, "What are known , as the Baby
lonian, ; tablct3. are a set of inscribed
plated .book leaves, written â¢ thousands of
years before the Christian era, * in which
is given an account of the Noachian' del
uge. ' These tablets were exhumed t from
the ancient city of Nineveh and are now
In the British Museum in London."
â¢ Now, .. Berosus,'- a Chaldean astronomer
and one , of the ablest men ' of Â¦ his time, 1
wrote a history of the Babylonian empire,
In which he notonly quoted the/Babylo
nian tablets, but also declared that an-,
other flood would. surely, take' place when
ever the sun, moon and planets again ."' oc
cupied .. the sign /Capricorn.; ';.That;'thlsr
Btransre prediction is of unusual * interest
to persons now living is evident from the
fact that in December,-" 1901, the sun, Mer
cury, Mars. Jupiter and Saturn will be lo
cated In the sign of Capricorn, as required
by Berosus, while the moon and Neptune
will be In the opposite' Bign. Cancer, to
ward the end of the month. . Â¦
It may be argued that th<Â» conditions at
that time will not be exactly the same us
those* which prevailed at the. time of the ,
deluge, since"", neither \Venus, Horschel.
Neptune nor the moon will. be in Capri-',
corn. The reply to this is that Herschel
and Neptune were unknown i at , the" time Â¦
of the delupe and that/consequently, even
If they had been in Capricorn, neither, Be-,
rbsus nor any other astronomer could
have chronicled - tlie fact. Venus. ;: more
over, is a ' minor planet and of . little " im
portance in' such a matter, ami as for the
moon, though she may not be in Capri
corn while the. other planets are there in'
close conjunction, she will . certainly be
there for scmie hours about that time. The'
question, therefore, which many persons
are.now asking* is, .Will a' second great
deluge take place, during December, 1001V
To 'such an important question scientist*. .

mate of thelr^vie ws < may be : gained , from
the following statement in Coming. Events, â¢

A 'N &W â¢ Tfl>O>or* M *w rOK THB SHRINKFrom the- little black book I had learned
many things about the life of the fire
man, and I knew it wa3 not as easy a^
it looked. True, there Is much of his time
that Is his own. but he must spend it
within the four walls of the engine house.
He must sleep there, spend h!3 waking
hours there, and must eat within a block.
For a man of family there Is not much
opportunity for home life. On Mondays.
"Wednesdays and Fridays he must go reg
ularly through the pompier tower drill at
the tower on North Beach, using all tho
apparatus of tho department, fighting
mimic fires and -savins: mimic people. Ha
has manual work about the stable and
In the care of the horses. His apparatus,
vehicles and harness must be kept In per
fect order, and he must be on duty twen
ty-four hours out of every day. He must
be ready at all times to risk his life for
that of others. He must brave the fiercest
heat and the most absolute exhaustion,,
and must never be found wanting. Unless
he is all these things, he Is not a good
fireman, and Is not entitled to his eighty
dollars per month, with the chance of a
raise to ninety and then a hundred at tho
end of the first and second years. He is*
a prisoner within his own district, and
his life he Rives to the service twenty-four
hours out of every day of it.
Or.ce In a while he has the opportunity
to distinguish himself, and his bravery
comes before the attention of the public.
Otherwise he is a very obscure individual
âone of itÂ© unknown heroes.
"When the alarm sound?," said Mr.
Kerrigan, "I jump up here to my station,
see that everything i3 all right and then
pull this cord. The cord 1? attached to a.
little piece of mechanism that bursts Che
bottle of acid, which is in the middle of
the powder, and the fire ta all kindled and
the steam started. By the time we get
to the tire we have the pressure up to the
required number of pounds'. We keeo the
temperature up to sixty all the time."
He fixed a fresh arrangement of kind
ling and went upstairs. Ten minutes af
ter the return of the engine the fire
men were all in their bunk:' and asleep.
They fall asleep with the si-.zr.e mechan
ical easiness as th<y wake up, and thÂ«
exhaustion of their half hour's hard work
did not offer a hlr.arar.ee. The two mea
on watch -were rerulin;? again.
"We'll have a hard morning's work fop
that little ttamej' said Kngineer Kerrigan,
walking up to the boiler. "I'll have t4

to clean ud the rest of the outfit. You
know every morning we are supposed to
have things spick and span and be all
dressed by 10 o'clock. After tx fire, though*
we get longer time. I'd like to get ai
this engine to-night, but I can't do any
thir.g with her till she 13 coojed off.
There's about ninety pounds of steam
pressure in there yet."
Then he explained the method of light
ing the fire. Underneath the engine a
pan of kindling and shavings li always
kept, and underneath that a powder
known as "Greek fire." which when ex
fiosed to a particular kind of acid bursts
nto flame.
Lieutenant Nicholson shouted at mtÂ»

me backward. I staggered to my feet and

myself at my place at the back of tho

after the alarm from Box 61 was turned In
we were off, with a rattle and a bans:.
Ahead of us the grvat engine dashed on,

Sparks were Hying from tho fire â¢ under

pressure En the boiler was Increasing. The
backs of the three grays that drew the
hook, and ladder truck rose and fell In
front 01 us and the step upon which we
were standing swung backward and for

llremen, who had clambered over the sides
of the truck and taken their places unon

gum coats and helmets. The stoker was
strapped in his feat and pulling hard at
the bits of the animals. Around the Mint

buggy. It was no easy matter to hold
to the railing of the truck. The cobble

smoke were coming back to us from the

of a helmet here," he said. "I wonder if
Ihey'il adopt 'cm htre and soak us four
dollars for the addition to our wardrobes."
The subject was turned. Captain
Doherty took up the -little black book,
turning to the "uniform .page," and ex
plained. The department had the week
before adopted a new style of iirema:i'd
helmet and according to the rules each
iiwman was requested to provide h!ms';li
with one, at the cost of a tour-dollar hole
in his salary.
"Hut here's where we get our money s

to be' cheerful; -"you sec these hats are

a public or quasi-public' character, when-'

"If your Honor pleaee^and gentlemen
of the jury: In the opening, -gentlemen,
of the very remarkable argument which
has been presented by my learned friend,
who dwelt upon the great importance of
this case from the. standpoint of his cli
ent â told you of the momentous conse
quences that were Involved in it to him!
There Is another aspfft of this matter,
gentlemen, which rerja*Â»rs your verdict
also one of paramount Importance, be
cause by. that verdict you will define aa
far as in your power lies the proper limit
of the liberty of the press in this State,
and of its rights and duties. You will de
termine by your verdict under a certain
given state, of facts, which we hope and
feel confident we will be able to prove to
your entire satisfaction, the question
which I have asked youâ most of you, at
leastâ In examining you as to your com
petency to sit as jurors in this case, to
wit: Whether it is within the rights and
within the duties of a great public jour
nal In thin State, whenever it shall ac
quire reliable cognizance of conduct of In
dividuals which i3 of such an open and
-flagrant character or takes place under
such circumstances that It, becomes ' a
menace to the morals of the community,
whether, I say, under such circumstances,
it Is the right and the- duty of the presi
to expose to public view this' conduct with
appropriate comments upon it, so as to
shield public morality from its taint, and
to protect the purity of tho- homes and
the characters of the inhabitants, of the
community. That, gentlemen, is another
element which adds Importance to your
deliberations, and gives weight and char
acter to the verdict which you nre called
upon to render in this case. I do not
question that 'this case is- an Important
one to the plaintiff. I hope you wil! not
question that it is one equally important
not only to the defendant as an individ
ual, but to the community and to the
State of which he is a member.
D. M. Delmas began the closing Speech
for the defendant immediately upon the
opening of the morning session of the
court. His argument In full follows:
.'"Now; â¢ that editorial, -'grentlemen.lipub-.

ence of their families have admission to the
homes of the city It then becomes necessary

THE EXPOSURE OF SCANDALS.
"Gentlemen, .these sentiments and the
proper attitude of the press with refer
ence to matters of this kind, feebly voiced
by me in what I. have already stated to
you. are much better expressed in the
carefully prepared editorial which was
published on the very next day after the
article in question, in order to apprise the
public, those who mi^ht be Ignorant upon
the subject, of the attitude of the press in
matters of this kind. That editorial,
which has been put in evidence by the
plaintiff here, reads as follows:
, "It remains for you, therefore, gentle
men. In this case In the discharge not
only of the duty which you owe' to Â¦ the
plaintiff In this case as an individual but
in the discharge of that higher duty which
you owe to yourselves and to the-com
munity whose mouthpiece and authorized
representatives you are to-day, to deter
mine carefully what are the facts '-in this
case, and' then to. decide upon. those facts,
whether they afford to the defendant as
the owner of this paper that protection
and that immunity which entitles him not
only to be exempt from punishment and
fine but entitles him to be looked upon as
a benefactor of the public. in the course
which he has pursued and adopted.,;
surable, deserves 'the respect and com
merfdation of every right thinking man
and woman.
"That is the third consideration, gentle- (
men. which I lay before you when you
come to Inquire into the motive of Mr.
Spreckel3. and the utter lack of warrant
and foundation for this monstrous state
ment of the learned counsel. Gentlemen,.
on the contrary, on thÂ« loth of October,
fifteen days before this article was pub
lished, news came at dead of night of
certain things going on In the Palace Ho
tel which had led to certain consequences, .
which the learned counsel would not allow :
us to prove and which reflected upon tho
plaintiff -here and his brother In such a
manner that the general manager of tha
paper." Mr. Leake. In consultation and '
with the advice of the heads o* hi* staff,
deemed the matter .of such moment thai>
he shrank from assuming* the responsibil
ity of fulminating such a cha?gÂ«, though
"Where, then, gentlemen. Is there a par-,
ttcle of- evidence In this case that war
rants the heated and exaggerated state
ment of the learned counsr 1 that this arti
cle was born of the malice of John T>.
Spreckels. and his desire to avenge him
self for some fancied wrong upon a man
with whom he had but a bare passing ac
quaintance, a man with. whom he had had
no business*, a man who had never of
fended him personally, a man whom he
certainly never had offended In his life?
stumbling through so many diversified
paths of business If the guiding 1 star
which led him on had been that of malice,
instead of good will to his fellow men..
The conduct of the man, the enterprlac-s
that he has engaged in, the success which
he has achieved, are an ample refutation.
In addition to that which I have stated to
you drawn from the stri(t Instructions
which he gave, to the charge that he was
actuated in any matter which he trans- ;
acted, by malice. .
"In the third place, gentlemen, wherrj
my learned friend speaks of the malice of
Mr. Spreckels .that he desired to 'gratify
his unscrupulous malice by the publica
tion of this article' to *blast the reputa-,
tion and fame of a man against whom he>
entertained some feeling of personal en
taltf.' does my learned friend overlook '.

first spoken of. from the very dawn of
Information which they had upon that
subject, until the time that it saw tho
light in the edition of the 23th of Oct>-;
ber. Mr. Spreckels was 12<> miles away;
from San Francisco, at the sugar factory i
in Salinas, having no personal knowledge
whatever of what was going on In the of
fice of The Call, none whatever of thl*.
news that had been received from San|
Rafaelor from General Warfleld; only
learning of it en ..is way to" San Fran-,
Cisco after noon of the very day that tho J
article was published by reading it in the
paper? Is It pretended that Mr. Spreck
els Inspired this article? No one so pre-j
tends". Is it pretended that he knew of .
the information given from San Rafael?
No cne so pretends. Is it pretended that
he knew of the interview with General
Warfleld? No one so pretends. Is it pre
tended that he knew of the interview as
composed and about to be sent to tho
press? No one so pretends*. When that
was done he was tjuictly asleep in his
bed 120 miles away. I.< it pretended that
hÂ«Â» saw or approved Â»r sanctioned or
ursed the publication of the article? No
one so pretends, for he had no knowledge
of it until after it was published.
"In the next place, gentlemen.,' It Is a
matter riot* only testified -to in this case

MALICE IS NOT
GUIDING STAR
"In the second place, gentlemen. I call
your attention to this fact: Three years
ago Mr. Spreckels became the owner and
therefore editor of this great paper. He
was not brought up as a newspaper man
or. owner. His walks had been in other
fields of enterprise and of business. But
his native sense of justice and of right
made htm lay down at once, for the guid
ance of the nun under him. one funda
mental and cardinal rule, from which he
has never departed, one line of conduct
from which he has never permitted that
paper, knowingly, to swerve, one maxim
which has been rigorously and undevlat
ingly enforcedâ and that Is that nothing
should be published in the paper without
first having undergone the most minute
examination as to Its truth and accuracy;'
and, secondly, that If, notwithstanding a'l
these precautions. in the hurry with
which a daily newspaper Is of necessity
given birth, some thing should elude the
scrupulous vigilance Imposed upon the
employes which was not strictly accurate
and true which was the cause of any un
just sufferings to any human being, as
soon as these facets were ascertained a re
cantation, a retraction or a modification
should at once take place, and the or
ders were that that retraction or modi
fication should be printed in the paper in
a place as prominent and in type as larp?
and- visible as the original article Itself.
Th,at testimony, gentlemen, you ha\*e
heard, and it is undisputed. This was the
spirit with which Mr. Spreckels entered
upon his new. though Important, duties aÂ»
owner and editor of th's paper, and in that
spirit of fairness and justice that paj^r
has been, he tells you. so far as he knows,
and. so far as , It has been In his power
to make It so, steadily "and undeviatingly
conducted. <
"Does not the reputation, independent
of any other consideration, does not the
reputation which Mr. Spreckela enjoys in
this State, to the knowledge of every man,
do not the methods upon which he and
his family have conducted their business
and their enterprises in this State for
now half a century In themselves rebut
such a preposterous and half-voiced ac
cusation as that?

Rafael by blasting the reputation " of its
owner, because, forsooth, if 'might affect

here. .

THE PERORATION OF. H.IS.. CLOSING ARGUMENT FOR THE pETENpANT, WHILE THE AUDITORS THAT
CROWDED THE COURTROOM LISTENED BREATHLESSLY TO HIS ELOQUENT ' WORDS."
Messengers were sent for Baron von Schrocder and his friends.
They hastened to the courtroom and iverc seated zvlien the jury filed
into court. Eagerly, earnestly, anxiously, Baron von Schrocder scan
ned the faces of the mm zvho held in their hands something which
his attorney had declared was more sacred than life â his honor.
"Gentlemen of the jury," asked the Judge, "have you reached
Slowly the foreman arose, advanced to the rail, unfolded a pa
per and said: "We have. We find in favor of 'the defendant."
Bcron von Schrocder dropped back in his chair as if he had
been stunned. He had learned that in California a jury justifies a
newspaper which dares to expose any man, however, powerful lie
may be, who makes himself an enemy to honorable men and honest
women. ,.Â¦Â¦Â¦-"â¢ . â¢-. ,
The jury Hied solemnly from tlic room. The audience departed
and silence reigned. At 6:$o o'clock the jury was ordered again
into court. It had not reached a verdict, as one of the men insisted
upon finding Baron von Schroedcr guilty. His sense of justice blind
ed his knowledge cf the law. The jury teas taken to supper and rc
turr.sd, and then in the silence of the courtroom there was the sound
cf a bell. A verdict had been found.
And then Attorney Maguire arose to answer one of the most
remarkably brilliant defenses ever made in California. He talked at
length, but added no nezv feature to his first argument. Darkness
was creeping into the courtroom, tlie chandeliers were lighted and
Judge Angdlotti delivered his charge. *
His thought sparkled in ivit, grew grave. i scvere, masterful in
denunciation. With the superb power of the logician he presented an
analysis of the testimony in tiic case, lifting from the mass, of hor
rifying details the vital elements which gave character, meaning and
'justification to the accusations of The Call. And when he had fin
ished men in the courtroom were in tears. Men in the jury box were
stern in their effort to suppress emotion. Baron von Schroeder's
crime against the purity of homes was understood in all its naked
From the beginning of the day to the moment when the sourd of
a bell trembled through the courtroom and announced that the htr\
had found a verdict intense excitement reigned in the courtroom.
The closing argument for The Call opened the day, and in this de
fense of an act of public policy D. M. Delmas contributed a master
piece of American forensic eloquence. He was forceful, logical,
brilliant. His invective possessed the deadly power of conviction.
He seas calm, judicial, fair in his presentation of tlte testimony in
the case and in the inevitable logical conclusions of that testimony.
Never before in a court of 'justice in this State, perhaps nowhere Â¦
else, was a more dramatic,' tragic scene enacted.- Baron von Schroeâ
dcr sat dumb in the agony of personal interest and saw the mental
picture of himself as he was described despicable, dishonorable, cow
ardly in the worst cowardice of which a being above a brute can be
guilty. He saw himself the despoiler, the drunken,- sensual thief of
the dearest, best gem a woman possesses. 'He saw. himself the enemy
of society, cringing m fear of the vengeance of outraged husbands,
brothers and fathers. Stung until his face flushed blood red, until
he Mnchtd and trembled before the menacing, castigating finger of

"I will Eay, then, srcntlemen, as I con
clude these general remarks, that we are
then brought to the examination of the
article Itself, to its origin, its develop
ment and Its final publication. What was
the origin- of the article? In this city of
San Rafael, in the month of October and
for some time previous thereto, was a.
young man who acted as the correspond
ent of the San Francisco Call â Mr. Per
kins. Early In Octobtr Mr. Perkins flnt
made a statement at The Call office relat
ing to the conduct of the Baron at the
hotel and the consequences that that con
duct brought about. And this, gentlemen,
was the statement then made orally, in
October, by Mr. Perkins to Mr. Leake.
And if you care to follow me, Judge Ma
guire, In this matter 1 will read from
pages 62 and 63 and pazes Ci and 65 and
page C7 of the official .record. Mr. Per
kins told to Mr. Leake the following
story:
Mr*. Warfleld had Informed him that the
general would be obllfied to give up the lease
of the Hotel Rafael on account ot Baron von
Kchroeder'fl profligate' conduct; that for months
the conduct of the Baron toward the lady
guests of the hotel had been such that It had
grown notorious: that he had insulted wÂ»men;
that thrre were other women who were on
such Intimate terms with him that be could
not Insult them, but tha.t his conduct with
them bad been an Insult to decrnt women at
the hotel: that hia conduct had not been con
fined to the hotel, but that It had been carried
on at roadside resorts with thÂ» guests of. the
hotel, and Â«n particular at a place colled Pas
tori* s. or Fairfax Villa,; that he had taken
guests of the hotel there and Ills' conduct there
had been EUch that It had become noised about
the town, and that these stories were reflecting
seriously upon the hotel; that his carousals
around the hotel with members of both sexes
had been such that Mr. "Wat-field had been com
pelled to make repeated protests to him, and
that if that conduct did not cease that tho
Warflelds would be obliged to give up their
lease; that she did net believe that that con
duct would cease, because she did not believs
the leopard would change its spots.
"Now, that was the statementâ I quote
It verbatim from the reporter's official
transcript In this case â made by Mr. Per
kins to Mr. LeakÂ© early In October and

ORIGIN OF THE
ALLEGED LIBEL
Mr. Delmas â You are entirely welcome
to make any objections you please, Jucl^e
Maguire. They do not disturb me and If
they please you they are entirely wel
come.
Mr. Maguireâ Do I understand counsel
to intimate that the oourt prevented him
from proving the truth of this article if
he could?
The Courtâ You will have full opportuni
ty to reply to Mr. Delmas, Judge Ma
guire.
Mr. Slagulre â Well, it seems to me that
it is improper argument.
The Courtâ I do not understand that
that is the intimation at all.
men, would not that have been the course
of a man conscious of his own innocence?
But Baron von Schroeder, neither In per
son nor by friend, nor by attorney, nor by
any one, ever sought any Interview with
Mr. Spreckels; ever sought the. opportunity
to prove the baselessness of the accusa
tions contained in this article; but, like
a man conscious of the untonableness of
his own position, preferred to go into a
court of Justice to demand a quarter of
a million damages, and hopes to escape
the condemnation which his conduct de
served by excluding, through technical
appeals and objections, the evidence which
might be brought against him."
"On the". 24th of October of the same
month. Mr. Perkins, In pursuance of the
instructions which he had j received from
the office to keep track of this matter and
see If the lea?e was indeed to be given
up, telegraphed to Mr. Leake saying that
tho release of the lease was to be sfcrned
on the very next day. the 25Ui. In other
words, explaining that â I take my own
way, if .you please, beyond the limits of
a mere closely worded telegramâ Mr. Per
kins said In substunce to Mr., Leake: The
event which you had Instructed me to
watch is about to take place. The ar
rangements have been made. The Baron
has consented to these people giving up
their lease, and the formal documents and
papers are to be executed on the morrow.'
What was Mr. Leake, as manager.of the
paper, whoso first duty to the public and
to its patrons is to give the news of what
is going on In the world, the news" of
those events which are of absolute public,
or quasi-public nature, to do? : Not con
tent with the statement of his corre
spondent here, but pursuing the Just spirit
of those i instructions which he had re
ceived three years ago from his employer,
Mr. Spreckels, to publish nothing until
after every : available and . reasonable
source' of * Information had been , ques
tioned and exhausted, Mr.' Leake at once
telephoned .< to General . Warfleld asking
him If It were true Indeed that he was
about to give up the management of the
hotel with which his name had been iden
tified for Â«o long a, period. And General
WarflÂ«ldf replied,;. 'I regret, f I am sorry,
that the news has got ' out ; but since you
know, of It. â¢ IX you will come, hero In per-
"Wo then start out, gentlemen, If you
please, so far as the article is concerned,
Â¦with the undisputed fact that Mrs. War
field, early in October, in the rear office
of the Hotel Rafael, in the presence of
her husband. General Warfield, spea'c-
Ins to Â»- man whom she knew to be the
correspondent of a great metropolitan
newspaper, deliberately made these state
ments as to ths offensive course and con
duct of the owner of that hotel. That,
gentlemen, is a fact undisputed^and in
disputable here, it is a second fact in
that connection equally undisputed anJ
indisputable, that Mr. Perkins in the dis
charge of his duties as correspondent of
The Call immediately notified the man
ager of the paper of this important in
formation affecting a well known place
of public resort, affecting the character
and conduct of a well known Individual.
That is undisputed. What did the man
agement of the newspaper do? Did they
seize with avidity' upon this piece of In
formation coming from such a reliable
source?. No. Mr. Leake paid to Mr. Per
kins, 'Wait until we have a confirmation
of these things; wait until we hear that
there is substance enough in them to cul
minate in the threatened abandonment of
the lease, and then if we find that the
Warfields are indeed compelled to give up
the lease of that hotel by this man's con
duct, the story will have materialized
and it â¢will have assumed a tangible
shape, and then it becoming a matter of
public record and notorietyâ the giving
up of this lease â we will be compelled or
we will be at least authorized as a pub
lic Journal to acquaint the public with
the facts.' Is that disputed?. Not at all.
Bear in mind, then, kindly, gentlemen,
these three facts that we meet at the
very threshold of our investigation into
the origin of this article: First, that Mrs.
Warfleld in the presence of her husband
deliberately made these statements, re
ceiving his assent by silence. Second,
that Mr. Perkins in the discharge of his
duties did communicate these statements
to the manager of the paper, Mr. Leake:
and, third, that Mr. Leake withheld the
publication until tbe event toward which
they pointed should be determined In
point of fact, and It, was seen whether
the Warflelds were compelled in reality
to give up their lease. Bearing in mind
these three facts, gentlemen, and taking
them along with us as the chainman
takes his chain as he surveys a piece of
ground, and carrying them along In our
future measurements., let us proceed.
these statements? No one denies it. There
were present at that interview Mr. Per
kins, Mrs. Warfield and General Warfleld.
Mr. Perkins relates what Mrs. Warfleld
told him; the failure to call Mrs. War
field or General Wartleld to contradict
him is an admission that he tells the
truth, and, indeed, in the argument made
by the learned -counsel,. Mr. Perkins is
one of the few witnesses, though I am
not so certain of that, that has escaped
the general wholesale denunciations of
the learned gentleman.
"Do ycu believe, gentlemen, after hear
ing tl.c testimony of Mr. Spreckels given
to you here, do you believe, after hearing
the Injunction which he has given to his
staff from the start, do you believe that,
after he had suppressed the article on the
10th of October, fifteen days previous;
do you believe, after he had sent for Gen
eral Warfleld at the very first opportu
nity after reading this article, do you be
lieve. I ask you. that if General "\Varfield
had at that Interview Bald, 'Mr. Spreckels,
this is an unfortunate article, it is not
true. Baron von Schroeder, during the
many years that I have conducted the Ho
tel Rafael, has always behaved like a
perfect gentleman. His conduct toward
the lady guests of the house has always
been characterized by chivalric courtesy
and propriety. I have never heard of his
doing anything that could be censured or
made the subject of reproof.' Do you be
lieve, gentlemcu, that John D. Spreckels
would not at ence have given . orders in
the very next issue of the paper to say,
'By Inadvertence we have done unwitting
injustice to a worthy gentleman. We de
sire to say that the source of our infor
mation was Incorrect and we make the
amende honorable, which every honest
man should make to every other man
whom he has unwittingly wronged'? You
know that would have been the course of
the paper. Tou know that would hav<*
been the impulse of Mr. Spreckels.and you
know that his authority there was su
preme,
"Let* me call your attention In the next
place, gentlemen, to a very singular fact:
That article was published on the 25th
of October, now more than a year ago.
The plaintiff here claims that it did him
a great injustice. Gentlemen, did the
plaintiff ever seek Mr. Spreckels personally
or by his representative to have that in
justice righted? If he had been, as I say,
conscious of absolute innocence of all the
things with which he waa charged in this
article, do you believe he would not have
gone to Mr. Spreckels In his office and said,
'Mr. Spreckels, you have done me an Injus
tice. I can satisfy you that these thing's
are not true. You have brought suffering
upon me and mine, and I appeal to you an
a generous, an honest and Just man, to
right, as far a* you can. the wrong that
you have started unwittingly, I believe,
to do to me and mine"? Do you believe,
gentlemen, that that would not have been
the course of a man conscious of his own
rectitude? And do you, believe that If
that appeal had been made to John D.
Spreekels, and it could have been substan
tiated even in a slight degree, that the
generosity and the innate kindness of his
nature would not have embraced the op
portunity to right an apparent wrong
which had been committed? Or, if you
say that Baron von Schroeder shrank
from going personally to see Mr. Spreck
els for fear, if you please, that he might
not be able, to oontrol, the ardor of his
temperament, or his Indignation, why did
he not send my learned friend there?
Why, when he consulted him, did he not
eay, 'Judge, go to Mr. Spreckels. I have
been deeply wronged. I know that he has
no cause of complaint against me. I
have never hurt or sought to hurt a hair
of his head. 1 have had no business
dealings with him. Go to him and tell
him that he has wronged me, and Invite
him to a complete investigation of my
conduct. I am ready to satisfy him that
this article Is not true. Appeal to his
tense of Justice and of right to pet mo
right before this community'; Gentle-
Intend to Imply by this letter is that I
personally did not see these things; mean
ing. I personally did not sit up from S
o'clock until the gray dawn of the morn-
Ing to eee the Baron gambling In the club
house; I personally did not sit up from 8
at night until 4 o'clock in the morning in
one of the winerooms of the clubhouse
and see him drinking and getting drunk
with women. I personally did not see him
drive to some resort up here somewhere
in the valley with married women and
come back at 3 o'clock in the morning in
a maudlin, drunken condition; I person
ally did not see these places in San Rafael
v.-here a certain woman made assigna
tions for him with young girls and women
by Inviting them to dinners, and so forth;
I personally did not see him sitting in the
maze or sitting upon the porch with
women on his lap and fondling them. But
all these things have come to me, and I
believe them to be true, and I do not wish
to and do not intend to retract them. 1
That is what General Warfleld in lan
guage and in fact and by proper infer
ence Elated to Mr. Spreckels.
lished?
Mr. Delmas â To Mr. Leake.
Mr. Magulreâ The statement that Wal
ter Dean said particularly. It was made
afterward.
Mr. Delmas â Very well, It was made af
terward. It is possible, but highly Im
probable, gentlemen, I am in error as to
this, for I copied this language
verbatim from the record, of which I have
an official copy, at the time, that a cer
tain lady wrote, asking If Baron von
Schroeder was at the hotel, and if so she
would not come there while he was pres
ent.
"Now, that Is the statement of General
Warfleld, confessedly the whole of It, as
I Infer from the learned counsel's remark,
-with the single exception of that relating
to Mr. Dean, which he disputes, and in
Â¦which I do not agree with him, but the
balance of It at least la not disputed by
him. as the statement made by General
Warfleld on the night before the publica
tion of the article when Mr. Leake and
Mr. Raymond had gone there to ascertain
the truth. ' Now, gentlemen, to the ques
tion of malice I am addressing myself.
Will you please place yourselves now as
the editor or manager of a great paper.
The manager, If you please, for Mr.
Spreckels was away. Will you place your
selves In the shoes of Mr. Leake and ask
yourselves as honest men, candid, dispas
sionate, having no motives of animosity
against any one, desiring to injure no one,
but knowing that you were receiving a
salary from the owner of the paper who
was away, that you were charged with
the conduct of a great paper, and with the
duty of getting the news â I ask you If,
with the information that Mr. Leake had
that night, when he left General War
fleld's office, whether you would not con
sider it monstrous to have any one charge
you with malice in the publication of the
article that was published? What did
Mr. Leake have? He had the statement
of Mrs. Warfleld. as communicated to
him early in October by the correspondent
of the paper here. He had knowledge of
the transaction at the Palace Hotel which
was. 'killed' by Mr. Spreckels on the 10th
of October, but still Mr. Leake had knowl
edge of It. He had the knowledge Impart
ed to him as to the character of the
Baron's conduct by General Warfleld In
thl3 Interview which I have given you,
an interview which General Warfield
I knew would be published, for he had sent
I for the manager of the paper to come
there in person, he had seen with his own
eyes a reporter of that paper, pencil and
paper in hand, taking down his very
words. Ke was no child, he was no fool,
he was no obscure person. He had been
a general In our militia. He was a man
of years and of experience. He had been
a manager of hotels, one in San FYancls
co and one here, for years. He was still ;
manager of the California Hotel. Would
you have believed, gentlemen, that facts
coming to you from such a source, cor
roborated by the statement of the wife
made earlier in the month, corroborated
by the Information which you had re
ceived as to the escapade In the Palace
Hotelâ would you have believed that you
were publishing a falsehood when you
took such an article based upon such In
formation as this was? I cannot con
ceive it. gentlemen, for to imagine that
you could so believe would be to imagine
you lost either to common intelligence
or to common Justice, and that Justice,
gentlemen, which you would have admin
istered to you had you been acting under
these circumstances, and were you called
upon to pay a quarter of a million dollars
to answer for your acts, that justice
which you would have your fellow-man
extend to you, you must in justice extend
to him.
"Now, has General Warfleld, has Mre.
Warfleld, his wife, ever contradicted these
statements? Learned counsel says these
statements reflecting upon the Baron are
untrue. Has he called Mrs. Warfield to
prove them untrue? Has he called Gen
eral Warfleld to prove them untrue? They
were at the hotel, but General Warfield
Is said to have written a letterâ is said to
have written a letterâ I emphasize the
word, gentlemen, because there is no
proof, and If your Honor will permit we
shall -ask "an instruction to that effect.
There is no proof, not a particle- of evi
dence that General Warfleldk ever wrote
any letter to Baron von Schroeder. There
is so proof that he sver wrote the letter
Mr. Maguire â Do you claim that that
statement of General Warfleld was made
to Â¦ Leake before the article was pub-
to your hotel, and If I know of six, how many
more are there?"
General Wartleld sal<3: . The Baron's conduct
had brought scandal on the hotel and had
driven many respectable people away. That
formerly he had a good Sunday to Monday
trade, but the Baron's conduct had caused that
trade to fall away. That* he had acted like a
low. vile character. That there was a certain
prominent society woman of San Rafael whose
relations to the Baron von Schroeder were lla
blo' to become a public scandal at any time.
That she was In the habit of inviting young
women to parties "or dinners- given to the
Baron, and abetting him In debauching them.
Poker games were conducted by the Baron.
Certain fast women had made it so easy for
the Baron that they had given him a swelled
head, and he thought, he could Insult any
woman with Impunity. That hid presence at
the golf links had driven respectable j>eoplo
away. That a younc woman who had come
to the hotel a respectable girl,. but susceptible
to flattery, of which the Baron was a past
master, had been . ruined by tha Baron. He
had debauched " her right there : in the hotel.
Another one had been degraded by the mach
inations of the Baron and his brother. The
Baron and his brother . had ruined tha good
name of tho hotel, for the Baron took no pains
to cover-up these acts, but he rather took
pride in flaunting \ them. " Quests Â¦ had com
plained repeatedly "of the Baron's conduct. He
followed women through the ground of the
hotel and ogled them from the veranda, Aa
elderly lady and her two daughters complained
that he .would follow them about the grounds,
bobbing up here and there and in Â«TÂ«iyw&y
making himself so obnoxious that thÂ«y finally
left; Mr. Walter. Dean had' said: "I know of
Uj, prominent people who have refused to go
"And now what took place? .You have,
gentlemen, as authentic sources of in
formation as to what took place at that
interview, first, the testimony of Mr.
Leake; you have, second, the testimony
of Mr. Raymond, and you have, third, the
very notes, the very paper from which Mr.
Raymond took down In writing the very
words which General Warfleld uttered
upon that occasion, and those notes are
preserved and are brought into court and
are offered to learned counsel for inspec
tion and to be put' in evidence, and would
have -been, put In evidence If he had not
objected to them. But the notes existed,
the Identical pieces of paper and the Iden
tical writing made at the time by Mr.
Raymond, coiroborated by the testimony
of Mr. Raymond and Mr. Leake, neither
of whom have been or attempted to be
contradicted in thitÂ» case. You have heard
the statement that Mrs. Warfleld made In
the office of the Hotel Rafael. "What was
the statement that General Warfleld made
In the California Hotel on the evening of
the 24th of October, 1899? -This is the
statement: , â¢ .
"That is the fourth fact, gentlemen, in
the birth of this article, or the fifth which
I desire you to bear in mind. The con
ference in the office of the Hotel Rafael,
the report of It given to Mr. Leake, the
instructions given to Mr. Perkins, the
telegram of Perkins, and, in the fifth
place, the communication by telephone to
General Warfleld, to which I have Just
alluded. Now. what took place? What
did these malignant defamers of private
character, these men who had a grudge
and a malice to vent of their own, and the
principal of the paper, as we are told. .too?
Mr. Leake, whose duties obviously do not
permit him to act as Interviewer and
gatherer of news, being at the head of the
paper as Its managerâ Mr. Leake proceeds
in person to the California Hotel to Inter
view General Warfleld and from his own
lips to. ascertain what the facts are about
that transaction. What took place at that
Interview? We haVe such a complete au
thentic record, such a' complete bulwark
of proof upon that subject that the
learned counsel has not and of course will
not, because he has too much candor to
have made, and the length of it affords a.
sufficient warrant that he has done us the
Justice, since he would not submit this
case without argument, at least to pre
sent fully and fRlrly in hia opening all
the arguments he had to present; and
therefore I say that the events which took
place at that interview with General War
fleld as detailed by our witnesses have not
been and will not be questioned for the
simple, fact that they cannot' be.

I C<> not think, may it please your Honor,
that I transgress the bounds of propriety
when I state that you were authorized
to infer what the character of that in
formation was from the conduct of the
plaintiff and his counsel in this case.
The Courtâ The ruling of the court upon
that particular evidence was to the effect
that it was not essential to a Justification.
Inasmuch as it was admitted by counsel
that It did not refer to any article that
reflected upon the plaintiff the court ruled
It cut on that ground and promised to ln-
Etruct the Jury that It was not essential

learned counsel last night? Does your
Honor recall that he especially dwelt upon

make that statement. The purported let
ter is addressed to fiaron von Schroeder,
confessedly the plaintiff here. It addresses
him as *My dear sir.' It Is signed, sub
scribed 'Believe me. very truly youxa.' It
professes to place tha author of it la a
position of amazement and regret at tha
publication which has been made. Why
In the name of Justice is not that letter
produced? It Is addressed to the plain
tiff. He must have received It. It pur
ports to be a friendly letter to the Baron
von Schroeder, calling him 'my dear sir,*
subscribing It with an exhortation to
'believe me. very truly yours.' Why 13
not that letter, if there la any such a let

made, because here is a copy of It. You
have heard the explajiation of that letter,

the court will instruct you, gentlemen, ac
least we ask the court to Instruct you,
that the letter itself does not contain one>
single particle of legal evidence that Gen

over other catarrh remedies:
First: These tablets contain no cocaine,

it is recalled that many catarrh remedies
do contain these- very objectionable ingre-
dients.

variably do.

Dr. A. Conan Doyle, the novelist, who
went to 'South Africa and labored as a
volunteer surgeon for months, lias not
been Impressed by the efficiency of the
British army. Dr. Doyle has written sev
eral sketches and at least one serious
criticism delineating the lessons of the
war as ho understands them. Incident
ally, he pays tribute to the military
genius of the Boers, who proved them
selves bo far superior in marksmanship,
in cover and in mobility.
He suggests reorganization of tne Eng
lish aimy on a peace basis of 100,000 men.
He would abolish the lance, eword and
revolver, substituting for cavalry 40,000
mounted infantry, each Individual soldier
selected for marksmanship and good rid
ing. He would have a highly trained ar
tillery arm and merely skeleton Infantry
organizations to preserve names and tra
ditionsâsay thirty highly trained marks
men to the companyâ to leaven the militia
with jwhich they would be recruited for
war Dr. Doyle argues that such an or
ganization can be more economically
maintained on a peace footing and more
efficiently filled with intelligent recruits.
Besides these measures he advocates re
form in officering the army, less gold lace,
less luxury at mess, less frippery and
more serious work. #
Dr Doyle Is a shrewd observer and a
thorough student. He is familiar with
the army organizations and military prac
tices of the world. Long an admirer of
the American citizen soldier and the.mili
tary system of this country t he has not
been slow to appreciate the splendid qual
ities of the Boer, who can go from the
farm to the battlefield with steady nerves,
true aim, marvelous ingenuity In finding
cover and the discipline born of Individual
thought, with singleness of purpose. In
common with many thoughtful observers
Dr Doyle has little faith In huge standing
armies or barrack parades.. His reliance
is in men trained in the art of fighting
with guns, delivering punishment at a
minimum risk, exercising individual intel
ligence and animated by a spirit of united
patriotism that secures better cohesion
than severity of military discipline.â

BRISTOL, R. I.. I>ec. 22.â The keel of
the new cup defender was successfully
completed at the Herreshoff shops this
afternoon. The actual work of casting the
great mass of more than ninety tons took
six and a half hours and was done at the
south shop. The fires were lighted under
the melting pots between â¢Â» and 5 o'clock
this morning, the kettles having been pre
viously filled with the pigs of lead.
Nat Herreshoff gave the order to turn
the valves which allowed the metal ta

at 7'2Q this morning. During the progress
of the work everything went on smootn
ly and the portion of the craft which has
so Important a bearing on her in the wa

when the order was given to cease pour
intr the metal. About five tons of piÂ« lead

these are now firmly embedded In the
m it will take about two day* for the keel
to cool sufficiently to allow men to
work on It, but nothing will be done with
it until Wednesday, when the sand in
the wooden frame will be removed and
later the planks will be pulled away. The
next process will be the. cleaning of the
keel and before the whole mass has all
foreign substance removed and. Its sides
polished a day and a half will have been
consumed. The holes to engage the bolts

While MacDonald was In the hand3 of
the surgeons a policeman eat near him
and kept him under constant surveil
lance. Technically he is under arrest and
in the custody of the police, but while the
fight for his life is going on there will be
no restraint beyond surveillance. Owing
to the critical nature of his wounds the
doctors have not permitted him to be
seen for the purpose of giving a state
ment.
MacDonald was removed to the emer
gency hospital, where the doctors have
been busily engaged in trying to save his
life. He was bleeding profusely from the
sashes he had made across his throat, but
Jt was found on examination that the
jugular vein had not been pierced and that
the wound was not likely to endanger his
life. The bullet wound In the breast
proved to be more serious. The bullet en
tered the left breast below the heart and
lodged in the back between the ribs. An
operation was performed and the ball re
moved. The doctors were hopeful, the
man would pull through unless blood
poisoning or other unfavorable symptoms
developed. '>*â¢.' .
He has many friends, however, who re
gard him as a man of many excellent
qualities.
He was well regarded by the Treasury
officials, but was not popular with some
of the subordinates In his office, who com
plained that he was unnecessarily harsh In
his treatment of them and often exacted
more work than they could do. It also la
said that in order to keep the work up t6
date he would require them to work over
time and lose a part of their annual vaca
tion. The Treasury officials, however, do
not agree with these statements and say
that the Auditor required from each clerk
a good day's work and no more.
MacDonald is a brother of William H.
MacDcnald, the well known barytone,
manager of the Bostcnlans, who is said
to have educated him for the operatic
stage. He is unmarried, 53 years of age
and is tall and fine looking. He also is
from Ohio, and has been in the Govern
ment employ since soon after the Civil
War. In 1560. he was removed from his
position es chief of division in the office
of Commissioner of Customs. In 1890 he
was reappolnted clerk in the office of the
auditor of the War Department. In 1897
he was made disbursing officer In that
office. In addition to his other duties, re
ceiving in all $2000 a year.
. In February, 1900, his accounts were
found short $1000, and upon being required
to make an explanation hÂ» claimed that
on one occasion he had forgotten to close
his safe on leaving his office and that it
had been robbed of $1000. He produced
evidence which tended to exonerate him
from the charge of taking the money, and
as he immediately made good the amount
nothing further was done except to re
duce his salary to $1400 and transfer him
to the office of the auditor for the Post
office Department, where he was em
ployed at the time" of the tragedy. It is
stated that MacDonald has been a hard
drinker at times and many of his misfor
tunes can be traced to this source.
MacDonald after tiring again attempted
to get out of the room, but encountered
clerks and employes, whom the sound of
the tiring had brought to the doors, and
then turned and tired again. This is be
lieved to have been the fatal shot. The
employes who know MacDonald said he
had a grievance against Morris, who, he
claims, was responsible for having his pay
reduced. Others who knew him said they
could not attribute his deed to anything
but a diseased brain from overindulgence
in liquor.
Frank H. Morris was a native of Cleve
land, Ohio, 49 years of age, and leaves a
wife âand two sons. He entered the
Government service at the beginning of
the present administration as Auditor for
the Navy Department. During the first
two years he made an exceptionally good
record for efficiency, bringing the delayed
work up to date and putting the office In
better shape than ever before.
A year and more ago Morris was made
Auditor for the War Department, chang
ing places with Auditor Brown. In his
new place ho maintained his record as an
executive officer and soon had the work,
which was much behind, up to date.
An eye-witness to the latter part of the
encounter between the two men stated
that upon hearing the sound of the shots
he ran into the Auditor's office, which he
had just left. Upon entering the room he
saw the two men struggling in each
other's arms, MacDonald holding his re
volver close to Morris' breast. Â¦
Washington. Dec. 22.â Frank h.
Morris of Ohio, Auditor of the War De

about 2:10. o'clock this afternoon by Sam
uel MacDonald, also of Ohio, recently a
disbursing clerk of the Treasury, In the
former's office at Winder building, on Sev
enteenth street. Auditor Morris was clos
eted alono with MacDonald when the
shooting occurred. In trying to make his
escape ; MacDonald also assaulted . the
watchman, Thomas Cuslck, with the butt
of his revolver, i He was arrested while
leaving the building. Before being taken
into custody 1 , however, he shot himself in
the stomach, and also made an ugly gash
in his throat with a small penknife. When
the officers arrested him he was heard to
exclaim: "I did it I I know I'm done for!"

VANCOUVER, Dec. 22.â Little definite
news regarding the condition . of the
wrecked steamer City of Topeka, which
ran on Sullivan Rocks, Lynn Canal, a
week ago, 1 could be learned from the
steamer Victorian, which arrived to-day
from Skaguay. The Victorian passed the
wreck at night, so Captain Connell had
no opportunity of examining the Topeka.
H. Diedrlck, agent for Dodwell & Co. at
Skaguay. visited the wreck on Tuesday
and says that by patching her forward
and center and the breaks where leakage
would be possible she may be saved. The
vessel's portholes were opened shortly
after the wreck so that she would remain
full of water, and In that way be saved
from knocking around on the rocks. But
part of her decks have been swept away,
and it is- thought the vessel would be
down to her bare hull by the time she was
ready to be towed away.- . â¢ - .
Officers of the Victorian have developed
a more serious view of the Topeka's case
from statements they had heard made at
Skaguay by shipping men. According to
them there was little hope for the ves
sel, as she was breaking: up, and they be
lieve that she would certainly be a total
loss If a storm should occur.
The steamship Rival, according to re
ports brought here to-night by the tug
Rabbonl, had a perilous voyage from San
Francisco to South Bend. After leaving
Ban Francisco the Rival encountered
severe gales, and. when she succeeded In
reaching Wlllapa Harbor the weather was
ho stormy that she was unable to pick up
the buoys marking the "channel. While
lying to . she had the port . side of her
cabin stove In full length, and In that
condition, as the fury of the gale In
creased, she was compelled to put to. sea,
and while under a full head of steam
drifted broadside before the gale for forty
miles. She then headed for Cape Flattery,
arriving in the morning with only ten tons

Major George McCann, one of the best
known , tobacconists In the country, has
just given out the surprising information
that there has been a great decrease in
the use of cigarette, and he says the
most remarkable thinÂ« In the tobacco
business is the fact that within two years
the quantity of cigarettes smoked has de
creased 95 per cent, and where 100 cigar
ettes were smoked . In 1S93 but five are
smoked this year. Major McCann says
this shows the great power of public sen
timent, which Is strongly against the se
ductive little white rolls. The laws for
bidding their" sale entirely- In many of
they large cities of the country have had
much ; to do with the decrease in their
use, and there Is no denying that the cru
sade carded on by the women and other
opponents has also- had a great effect.
He does not believe the disappearance of
the cigarette from such , universal use
means that the influence of the tobacco
habit is less general, and he adds that
the only difference is that more . ctaars
are beingr used. The major says:
â¢â¢Another thlnjf that has killed the xlx
arette in the general practice of rolling
cigarettes from smoking tobacco. Another
cause for, the decline of the olgarette . li

If Vnn lyaAH kidneys, but now modern science proves that
Â¦ I I VÂ»U iwccu nearly all diseases have their bejrinnlns In the
Qwamn.Pnnt disorder of these most important organs.
OWdmp-ftOOli The kidneys filter and purify the bloodâ that
is their work. So when your kidneys are weak or out of order you can under-
stand how quickly your entire body Is affected, and how every orsan seems to fail to
do its duty.
If you are sick or "feel badly," begin taking the famous new discovery, I>r. Kil-
mer's Swamp-Root, because as soon aa your kidneys are well they will help all the
other organs to health. A trial will convince any one.
Many women suffer untold misery because the nature of their disease Is not
correctly understood. They are led to believe that womb trouble or female weals-
ness of some sort Is responsible for the many Ills that beset womankind.
Neuralgia, nervousness, headache, puffy or dark circles under the eyes, rheuma-
tism, a dragging pain or dull ache in the back, weakness or bearing down sensa-
tion, profuse or scanty supply of urine, with strong odor, frequent desire to pass it
night or day, with scalding or burning sensationâ these are all unmistakable srgns
of kidney and bladder trouble.
If there Is any doubt in your mind as to your condition, take from yoor urine on
rising about four ounces, place it in a glass or bottle and let It stand twenty-four
hours. If on examination it is milky or cloudy. If there Is a brickdust settling, or
if small particles float about In It, your kidneys are in need of immediate attention.
Other symptoms showing that you need Swamp-Root are sleeplessness, dizziness.
Irregular heart, breathlessness, sallow, unhealthy complexion, plenty of ambition,
but no strength. t
Swamp-Root Is pleasant to take and Is used rn the leading hospitals, recom-
mended by physicians In. their private practice, and Is taken by doctors themselves,
because they recognize in it the greatest and most successful remedy that science
has ever been able to compound. ,,â. ,_* \.
â¢ If you are already convinced that Swamp-Root is what you need, yotx c*n pur-
chase the regular fifty-cent and one-dollar bottles at the drug stores everywhere.

The other great case this week, the ar
rest of mortgage bankers, attracts an im
mense amount of attention. The press Is
pointing out the resemblance to the Stern

in the highest society, have carried on
fraudulent practices for years. The chief
offender, Sanden, made pretense of -the
greatest piety. lie had a private chapel
in a luxurious villa at Potsdam. His home
was the center of the highest militarj
and aristocratic society. He was Pots
dam's wealthiest citizen, paying 50,000
marks yearly in taxes. It has been shown
that Sandep's business practices were
most questionable. He would compel bor
rowers with the bank to buy one of his
Jots at a fancy price. The losses will fall
heavily on small investors. The fall in
the shares obligation of the two banks al
ready represents about 175,000.000 marks.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Dec." 22!â ~Dr. A.
D. Williams, assistant 'surgeon of the
United States army, has arrived- from
' Porto"'' Rico," where he "was detailed to
make a report on the 'condition of the
people aB observed by him on a march
with scftdiers across the island. That,re
port was madÂ© to the adjutant general.
Department of Porto Rico, San Juan. m A
copy of the report waÂ«Â» given out to-night
by Dr. Williams.
"At Los Marios," the report says, "we
began to see the vanguard of misery. In
that small, squalid town there is no med
ical man. Many werÂ« sick. A Mr. Ton
cuand, the American school teacher there,
told me that many, of the. people, not only
of the surrounding country but of tho
town, were in great distress^ I - asked him
the cause of so much sickness and so
many deaths. He answered without hesi
tation: 'For want of food.' "
The report continues: "At Adjuntas th.3
conditions were appalling; - men, women
and children, swollen, bloated, diseased
and emaciated, whose pinched and hag
gard features appeared weighted with the
sorrows of years. When I asked the city
physician of Adjuntas the cause of such
a large death rate â fifty-two deaths and
four births the week immediately preced
ing our visit there^-he replied: 'The death
rate is about the same every week. The
prime cause, chronic starvation.' "
Dr. William* ln this report declares that
with fourteen patients in the hospital at
this place and three nurses the municipal
authorities allow the steward to draw
only a dollar a day in municipal stamps
for the subsistence and care of the pa
tients, and with that the steward can
realize only 50 cents with his Btamps and
with that amount daily he has to sup
ply the scanty hospital food.

DYING OF STARVATION
PHOENIX. Arizona. Dec. 22.â J. S. Hopkins,
of SafTord. while running a sawmill at the
San Mogaletrt mine. Just across the Mexican
line, was cut to pieces by a circular saw two
days ago. He stooped over to pull a splinter
from a log lie was sawing, when his clothing
was caught by the saw and he was jerked
Into it.

LIMA, Ohio, Dec. 22.-Willlam Reddick.
of Findley, president of tho Producers'
Kxplosive Company, was blown to atoms
this afternoon by an explosion of nltro
glyccrln ln the magazine at the com
pany's factory near here. The explosion
shattered hundreds of window panes in
the city. The factory was closed yester
day for the holidays, and Mr. Reddick
had gone out to put a padlock on a door.

JLAKEVIEW. Or.. Dec 22.â The Lake-
View and Paisley stage was held up be
yond the Odd Fellows' Cemetery last
night by a lone highwayman, who de
manded the letter mall sacks. After
throwing off the pouches the driver
whipped up his horses and within ten
minutes after the hold-up Sheriff Dunlap
and Marshal Wharton were at the scene.
The sacks were found cut open and all
the letters gone. Owing to the darkness
the Jobber could not be tracked, and at
this hour the extent of his haul is not
known, but it is probable he received
nothing for his night's work.
Eleven days ago the Lakeview and Ager
stage was held up two miles from the
town and the mall rifled. The general
opinion is that the highwayman lives in
Lakeview.

against the administration's Philppine
policy. The occupants of the White House
are not superstitious and every one of
them is enjoying excellent health. Presi
dent McKinley has occupied more time
during the last two or three days assist
ing Mrs. McKinley in marking and for
warding Christmas presents than he has
given to public questions.
WASHINGTON, I>ec. 22.â Believers in
signs and omens -can be seen every day
at about 11 o'clock on the White House
portico intently examining one of tht?
eastern pillars.'* They have been told that
ut that hour when the sun Is shining a
shadow can be seen there ln the shape of
a hand with a stubby forefinger raised in
an attitude of warning.- It requires a
vivid imagination to figure out this hand,
but the superstitious- avow they have
seerf it and they associate it with an
alleged figure of a bent and aged woman,
who they say, fell before the portico be
fore the death of the President's mother.

- Last , Christmas society almost went
crazy over plum puddings and chocolate
hampers sent to the soldiers on the veldt.
This year they are not mentioned. In
fact, the public is unutterably weary of
the long drawn out struggle, Â¦whose only
interesting features are the Bensational
successes of Dewet. This in no way'af
fects the Government, whose determin
ation to fight it out to the bitter end Is
evident from its decision to reinforce the
already huge army in South Africa. Sev
eral members of the Cabinet, however,
would be heartily grateful to the Boer
leaders to suffer peace.
The Evening Standard says it hears a
report has reached London that Klmber
ley is seriously threatened by the Boers.
None of the leading South African firms
interested in Klmberley has received In
formation tending to confirm the report.
"It" would be unworthy of the British
name." Bays the Times; "to refuse credit
that la due to a feat of arms bo brilliant
as the unexpected .dash backward of
Dewet and his. men through the British
lines." ' 'â¢ ,. ' -m â¢ . -. Â¦Â¦
Other rajjora take the . same view, com
paring the ride to Sprlnghaas Nek with
the charge at Balaklava. In fact, admir
ation for -the extraordinary daring dis
played by the Boers on this occasion al
most predominates over the chagrin .. at
the failure of the British officers to cope
with their j enemies. .There, is springing
up a philosophic indifference' to the in
capability of generals ln South Africa.
Reverses have, become expected.
j LONDON, ' Dec. 22.â General , Dewet
would be by far the' most acceptable
Christmas box to the average Briton.
Though ". there seems to be little likeli
hood of this wish being granted the de
sire for the suppresslou of this wonder
ful Boer leader, however, is accompanied
by generous admiration of his latest feat.

' More the question of the day is Amer
ica's commercial rivalry, which; through
out the week has been forming the basis
for long analytical articles* in the Dally
Express and ' the. Dally Mall, written by
engineering, and other experts, which de
tail the results of recent trips to the
United States under the headlines. "Wake
Up, England." "We Are Falling Behind."
etc., reiterating that the English manu
facturers' Initiative is absorbed in com
mercialism, which is summed up ln the
following paragraph in one article:
"If the foregoing facts are unpalatable
it is better they should be known than
that the nation should dream on until the
next cycle of bad trade, when we find
our markets ln the possession of others."
The announcement that The Nether
lands does not consider Itself bound by
the Paris Venezuela commission's decision
on the Anglo-Dutch frontier is not re
garded by the Foreign Office as forming
the basis of international friction. The
boundary is a comparatively minor mat
ter on which the Colonial Office has been
engaged for some -time. The Netherlands
question is regarded as a step to ward
off a contingency which, however, Great
Britain has never contemplated.
LONDON. Dec. 22.â The Nicaragua canal
still fails to arouse any really, deep in
terest here, as it is thoroughly understood
that Great Britain will take action ln the
near future and the Chinese negotiations
are regarded more in the light of a mo
notonous farce' than a serious : problem,
thanks r .to the absurd misunderstandings
which have arisen between' the powers.
The only quarter In London where the
performance is thoroughly, enjoyed is at
the Chinese legation, at which Sir Chih
Chen X*> Feng La, the Minister 'of China.
xa*urninff seoludedly for his brother, is
reported to be in a state of j perpetual
chuckle over the atUtude of Christendom.

To-night the docks are quiet. It is said
that the agitators have decided not to'
make any manifestation to-morrow, de
siring to respect the entrance into the city
of Prince and Princess Albert of Bel
gium. The Burgomaster has taken pre
cautions to prevent an outbreak.
This afternoon an attempt was made to
resume operations at the Cockrell wharf,
and 2000 strikers attempted to prevent tho
resumption. The. strikers were dispersed
by the police with drawn sabers, and un
der police protection work was begun by
the foreign hands. Later the strikers
menaced the men who were working upon
the steamer Maze and threatened them
â¢with death. The workilien Â¦were put to
flight. The. most serious outbreak of the
day occurred at the Cockrell wharf, where
the strikers assembled and were chased
away by the police with drawn sabers.
The officers used their revolvers also, and
it is stated that thirty men were wounded,
and the riotorÂ§ were dispersed upon the
arrival of the police reinforcements.
ANTWERP. Deo. 22.â The striking dock
men became more defiant to-day and their
attitude resulted in several conflicts with
the police, one of which was serious.
Early in tho morning groups of strikers
interfered with the men who wer^comlng
from the provinces to take theiff. places
and ln several Instances the new men
were maltreated. Â¦.-.* : :

A Challenge Out.
A great challenge will take place
Wednesday, the 2d. â¢
FROM the earnestness displayed at. the meeting last evening to consider ways and means for
increasing the revenues of the University of California good auguries may.be drawn for the
success of the movement. The issue is one of the highest interest to the State. . Our general
educational development is advancing by leaps and bounds, and despite the additional advantages
of higher education afforded by the Stanford foundation, v the number of young" men and voting
women who are annually fitted to undertake a university course is greater than the universities can
rightly care .for. During the last ten "years the attendance at the University of California has in
creased 400 per cent while the income hag increased but 70 per cent. At the present time the
university is second to but one other in the United States in point of academic attendance, and yet
its income is but half of that of Stanford. /-'-' '
- Such being the situation an increase of the revenues of the university has become a matter of
imperative urgency. No further campaign of education upon the subject should be needed be
yond what is required to inform the people and their representatives in the Legislature of the
facts.
California cannot afford to lag behind other States in providing for the higher education.
The proud position the State now occupies in that respect must be maintained and advanced. All
departments of human endeavor have become so complex and so scientific in their methods that
only by the highest training can men be fitted to conduct industries to the full success. The States
that have the best trained . brains in -their service will rank highest, not only in spiritual*** anil
intellectual things, but in material prosperity. The higher education of aspiring young men and
women is therefore a public charge of great importance to all. It would discredit the common
wealth if her students were compelled to go to other lands to seek an education.
In the movement now being made for an increased income for the university there should be
cordial support in all parts of the State. Excellent plans have been proposed for accomplishing
the .desired end, and consequently no valid reasons can be found for opposition in any quarter.
It is a good movement with which to start the new year and the new century. Let each one in
proportion to his influence help it forward. '
FUNDS FOR THE UNIVERSITY.
to the throat, so tantalizing when permit
ted to slip I<T! oil over the palate, so com
forting when !t reached the stomach, thaf
thÂ© Sixth tasted and drank and tasted
CLÂ£aln and gathered in the horses. A rain
Â¦was falling that turned to glare Ice upon
the mountain Elopes, over which the regi
ment was advancing. The men were
drenched to the ekln. The "fence" threw
eff the chill, and, being unaccustomed to
Its wlllness and unwitting of ltÂ« final
deadly effect, the men took more and
wondered if angels had led them to this
retreat cf liquid sweetness. But be it un
derstood that while you may, even as a ,
novice, drink copiously of the stuff, there
oomes a moment when paraJysIa seises
the brain and the limbs. Tou fall in your
tracks as If ehot down. You are oblivious
to ail surroundings or conditions. You
are practically cocained, with enough suf
fering ahead of you when you come to to
keep you forever free from future trifling !
with thÂ« liquor. The Sixth to a man was
near the end of its labors, out la the wilds.
Tfhen it regimcntally collapsed. That* is.
It lay down in the rain and stayed down.
â¢ â¢ . â¢
There was standing only the temperate
colonel and the little Austrian bugler.
They made tnelr way to a nearby cabin,
whoee owner hospitably" welcomed them
sad Immediately proffered â¢ 'atone fence."
Do not ever thir.k that this story is part
of the official war record of the United
States Government- It is not. But if you
visit the quaint town of Olney, this State,
and chance to meet Colonel John Lynch,
one of Gricrson's old men, and one-time
commander of the Sixth Illinois Cavalry,
jnst have him confirm the matter. He
â¢will, and perhaps with more details than
here given. Colonel Lynch is a good man,
not a drinker, a rugged pioneer cf Illinois.
But his old regiment, once upon a time,
placed itself upon record as having the
Jolliest, jnost complete and satisfactory
tpree that ever befell 1200 fighting men.
It was a regiment of fathers, sons, cous
ins and neighbors, ragged In its formation
during the early days of the Civil War,
rot much thought of at the start by the
pride-swollen infantry. But hard fighting,
hard riding and hard discipline took the
kinks out of its manners, gave it sym
metry, pride and backbone â a combination
of qualities not forgotten by any man in
Jove with the dash of "Boots and Sad
dles."
There came a time in the history of the
Bixth. s=ays a writer in the Chicago Times-
Herald, when serving with Thomas at
Nashville, and being somewhat worried
by Hood and his antics it was ordered to
iro into the mountain district of Tennessee
and confiscate all the saddle horses' it
could find. Horses must be had, and
horw\s the Sixth went after, led by !ts
God fearing colonel and a bugler who had
once served in the Austrian army, and
could not only give all the Union trumpet
calls but also those of the armies of Con
tinental Europe. The regiment was not
made up of drinking men. Perhaps there
was a man here and there who liked hi3
"sup" after a wet tramp or other dis
agreeable duties, but generally speaking
the Sixth \ra> a clean command, most
TTw.fully ignorant of the seductiveness as
ttcII es vlciousr.ess of "stone fence." This
same "stone fence" Is a Southern drinkâ
a, high wall of fermentation â over which
r.o man ever climbed. It Is found In tho
illicit stills of the mountains. In barrels
back of the fiocrs of domiciles in the Cum
berland range. It Je served In tin ladles
or gourds, or sipped from fat-necked bot
tles, aforesaid necks emitting rich, deep
Eurgles as the "fence" moves Its position
from the bottle's interior to that of a
throat.
The way of the Eixth lefl It Into a re
erioa of stills from which the lanky pro
prietors had been driven by the terrors
of war. They left behind them much un
consumed "stone fence," which the Sixth
chanced to find, and as a matter of fact
cheerfully imbibed of. It was eo smooth
A REGIMENTAL "STONE FENCE."
"My bugler drinks for me," said the
colonel, and the little bugler drank.
"Call my men." said the colonel.
The bugler blindly made his way out
doors and placed his bugle to his lips. He
sounded every call he had ever learnedâ
the Austrian, the German, the French,
the Russian and the American calls. The
regiment heard as if from a far, far dis
tance. The regiment wished to obey, but
could not. In those days it was the fash
ion with cavalrymen to wear abnormally
long hair. The Sixth had lain down, sur
rendered to the "fence." with all its locks
outspread. Upon this the cold rain had
fallen, and then the chill had frozen the
hair to the ground. It was quite evident
If the Sixth was to get free it would
either have to be chopped out or wait for
a thaw. The waiting was Impossible, so
the chopping began, and finally a part of
the regiment managed to reach the col
onel'B' headquarters. Xow, a colonel can
punish one man for. bibulousness, or two,
or half a dozen, but to punish twelve hun
dred, that were too much for the doughti
est colonel that ever lived. Colonel Lynch
Â¦wisely chose the course of getting his men
into fair physical condition as soon as pos
sible and then made his way back to
Thomas. The regiment passed through
the war with an untarnished reputation,
returned to Illinois, 'dissolved and Its
members became good citizens.

THE State of New York had fine primeval forests. In that respect the State excelled even
Pennsylvania, which was named for its' founder and its forests. The timber of New York
was of great value, consisting of the finest hardwoods. A large share of it was cut and
burned to make clearings, and the ash was leached to make black potash, which was formerly
quite an article of commerce, brought in wagons down the Mohawk Valley to Albany. Gradually
the great forests of Cayuga, Onondaga, Monroe, Cattaraugus, Niagara and other counties disap
peared. With the forests, the streams and springs disappeared also., Central New York has
now much less moisture than sixty years ago, and its numerous clear streams are now occasional
tonents during the rainfall, and at other times are dry, with the exception of a few green and
stagnant pools. The great wagon and carriage works of Cortland and other places in the State have
been -compelled to resort to Canada for their hard timber, and there is a visible blight that has
fallen with the slaughter of the forest.
But New York has left the forest of the Adiroridacks, and is reserving it as rapidly as possible.
While it is too remote from the central and western part of the State to favorably affect moisture,
it guards the headwaters of the Hudson River and is of vast importance to a considerable section.
But there is marching to it an enemy of which we have seen no mention in the State forest reports.
Many years ago a Frenchman in Boston imported some specimens of the gypsy moth, a spe
cies unknown before to this continent. He expected to produce silk from this moth, which
makes a cocoon without feeding on the mulberry. His specimens escaped and in a few years the
forests of Massachusetts began to show the effect of their presence. The caterpillar of this moth
eat's all foliage, pine, oak, hemlock, maple, elm, beech, birch and all being on its daily bill of fare.
The State was finally compelled to come to the rescue of its forests, only to find that it must de
stroy them in order to destroy the moth. The expense account has run into hundreds of
thousands per annum expended by a moth commission. Itjs believed now that the pest is being
brought under control, but we are informed that it has crossed the State line, and its ravages were
seen recently within twenty-five miles of the edge of the Adirondack forests.
The insect sweeps on like a fire, and the only way to arrest it is by back-firing. If it gets
into the great woods of Northern New York it may be expected to spread rapidly westward and
threaten the forests of the whole continent.
The appearance of this awful insect in this country has led to a study of its past history in
Europe b"y geologists, botanists and dendrologists. Its prehistoric depredations are believed to
account for the total disappearance of vast forests, the record of whose destruction is written in
the rocks and the crust of the earth. With what it fed on it would also disappear, to return again
in after ages when the ground was reforested. It is believed that in its European habitat it ha'd
lost much of the destructive quality of its ancient congener, but its transfer to a new environ
ment has freshened its voracity and restored its primeval power to exterminate forests.
Entomologists have thus far sought in vain for an insect enemy to put upon its track. No
bloodhound of that vastly populated world of winged and crawling life has been found that will
prey upon it, therefore man has to fight the battle on unequal terms against a winged enemy,
and has gained what advantage appears only by himself destroying the forests on which his petty
antagonist feeds, with the intention of renewing them when the invading army has been starved.
It is hoped that this reference to the appearance of the moth so near to the Adirondacks will
attract attention in New York, that immediate steps may be taken to turn the attack and save the
great woods.
NEW YORK'S FORESTS.
THE most Important musical event
since .the grand opera season will
be the Strauss. engagement at the
California Theater, beginning next
Sunday evening* Strauss begins a
New Year musical programme of
which any city m'ight be pepud. The Graff
organization, with Sembrich, who shares
the lyric throne. with Melba; Osslp Gabri
lowitsch and Teresa Carreno, pianists of
highest achievement: Mile. Dolores (Tre
bclli), the admirable artist so well liked
and known here; the Henschels. whose
concerted v.ork has brought, them world
fame; and. lastly,, who will come first, Ed
uard Strauss, with his famous orchestra,
will all be heard, j
If the later days of the new year fulfill
the musical promise of. the spring, and
repeat only the last year's musical story,
then may we begin to lay claim to an."at
mosphere" in San Francisco, that myste
rious quantity without which artistically
we -are nothing. . Â¦
"We may have the throats of angels, and
'competent authority allows the State an
exceptional vocal birthright; we may
have genius abounding, also freely ad
mitted to exist here in phenomenal meas
ure; we may have among us cultivated
musicians galore, and every other vaunt
of musical fitness for comparison with the
effete East, but, until we have -the "at
morphere," csthetically we are not in It
with the older world. Boston has it; New
York claims it; even Chicago now alleges
acquaintance with the elusive quantity,
but only the pilotâ and he probably has
his weather ey.? upon other than the kind
discussed â will claim an "atmosphere" for
San Francisco.
"An 'atmosphere' Is a growth, therefore
not possible of rap*d achievement," ex
plains the Superior Person, who Is doing
us in three weeks. Surprised frequently
Into a momentary expression of admir
ation of the musical conditions here, the
wise man from the East Invariably ends
his little dithyramb with this saving "at
mospheric" clause. And that settles it
and us, so far a3 our artistic aspirations
are concerned, a final judgment against
which Is no appeal. But things grow fast
in California, and why not an "atmos
phere" like everything else? We are In
the ''genius belt." Athens, art center of
the old world: Toklo, heart of the oriental
civilization, with its wonderful art-devel
opment, are cheek-by-Jowl with San Fran
cisco so far as latitude Is concerned. With
Tafnp's claim that genius is a product of
physical conditions, climate and the rest
of it. and up-to-date Callfcrnlan evidence
all in favor of the theory, after the testi
mony afforded by the recent Grau season
as to a cultivated appreciation here ex
istent, we may reasonably allege the
dawn of an "atmosphere," and even a
musical air of modest standing. The con
ditions are all favorable, even our Isola
tion conducing to an artistic self-depen
dence, and it only remains to continue the
present policy of the "open ear" to that
which is worthy, the open purse for Its
practical support â alike to the visiting
rr.elstcrsinger and the local artist, to
achieve that desire of the city artisticâ
an "atmosphere." whose hopeful begin
nings are already with us.
It Isvgood to know that we are permit
fed to enjoy Strauss and his orchestra by
grace 6t~ critics Krehbiel. Henderson.
Huneker and even Finck. These gentle
men, whose musical wqrd Is Eastern law,
have a tempered and limited approval for
the famous Viennese, and his repertoire.
In his own domain, the wild witcheries
and fascinations of the Hungarian dance3,
the subtle and sensuous enchantment of
the waltz, the creation of the elder
Straus3 in its present form, the light bril
liancy of the polka and other arrange
ments in light, catchy rhythms, Strauss
Is acknowledged king. His orchestra of
fifty instruments, chiefly strings, a suffi
cient proportion of horns and trombones
find a, wood, wind quartet of soloists Is
hear** at Its best in these numbers, and
its best is the limit of what can be done
in this direction.
And h<?re the critics disagree as to the
necessity and place of the kind of music
in which Strauss and his orchestra excel.
Hendenson. while acknowledging the ex
cellence of its rendering, prefers the sym
phony concert for the public good and
says so. Krehbiel echoes Mr, Henderson,
or vice versa. But James Huneker, the
distinguished critic of the- Courier and
other publications, extends a glad hand
to the Hungarian genius, his* orchestra,
his repertoire and all that of him is.
Philip Hale, the Boston critic, makes the
unprecedented suggestion that the Boston
symphony orchestra should "play once a
year one of the Strauss waltzes!" intimat
ing that the classic audiences would
doubtless prefer it to one of the Viennese
Fuchs' compositions, for example, than
which, "in a liberal interpretation of the
phrare. It is better music!" And, by the
way. Wilhelm Gericke, leader of the
symphony orchestra, made'much of the
band and its conductor during their ap
pearances In Boston, which were made
in that sanctum sanctorum of the
symphony in America, Music Hall, and
under the direct patronage of Gericke
himself.
The progress of the orchestra through
the East seems Indeed t6 have been a
kind of triumphal march. Wresting rec
ognition of his own peculiar genius from
critic, pedant and musician of every ilk
alike, Strauss cornea to us with honors
thick upon his shoulders. His is a fa
mous name. Last of the Strauss dynasty,
son of the elder Johann. the waltz king,
and brother of Josef and Johann the
younger, his name is familiar to every
waltz-lover in both hemispheres. It was
this last Strauss* Intent to devote himself
to the consular service, and he received
an academic and philosophical training as
preliminary to the consular life. But
heredity, environment or family tradition
were too strong, and 1S62 found him at
the head of the Strauss orchestra In
Vienna.
For thirty-eight years now he has been
conducting successful "Hungarian bands "
touring every summer through tho princi
pal cities of Europe and occasionally ex
tending his tour beyond European boun
daries even as far as America in one In
stance. Ten years ago Herr Strauss gave
concerts in sixty-one cities of America
and, according to . the New York Herald'
has during the last twenty-two years
played in over eight hundred cities in the
two hemispheres.
Besides his own orchestra. Herr Hofka
pellmeister Strauss is, as the title implies
leader of the Imperial orchestra at the
Austrian court, which position of Imperial
and royal musical director he has held for
thirty-two years. He has all sorts of dec
orations, and such like, and Herr
Strauss is also a composer of some small
note, chiefly of dance music, though he
has arranged numerous operas and writ
ten a few songs. It is understood that the
Austro-Hungarian authorities In San
Francisco will see to it that their gifted
compatriot , is accorded a sufficient wel

IN "The Gay Ix>rd Quex" Mr. Pinero has
been accused of writing an immoral
play. That Is hardly fair, for things
vulgar are rot always things Immoral,
and, the objectionable touches in QuÂ«"x
are vulprar rather than Immoral. There
is ccthlrB In the play as immoral as the
final scene In "Siegfried," against which I
have not heard, or seen In print, a single
protest.
I am not defending Mr. Pinero's lapses
from taste; I regret them as much as any
one and consider them blemishes upon his
Jalr fame as a dramatist. But this can
rot blind me to the brilliant qualities of
Quex as a piece of writing or persuade
rce that the work as a whole Is immoral.
In^fted. If one Is hunting for a moral,
there axe several to be found In this play.
They may be stated seriatim as fo'.lows:
Moral One. That a bad man (Quex)
tr.cy be redeemed by his love for a pood
woman (Muriel). This affirmative propo-
Fition Is evidently Intended by the author
to stand in contrast with the negative
proportion which he maintained in "The
6?oond Mrs. Tanqueray," namely, that a
bad -woman cannot be redeemed by her
love for a good man.
Moral Two. That a gentleman (Quex)
should never hesitate to lie In order to
stve the reputation of a lady (the Duch
ess of Strood). In his comedy "Denlse,"
Dumas fils hae maintained this same the
f:-. complicating It with the (to him)
ecruaJly incontestable proposition that a
woman must never hesitate to tell the
truth even at the expense of her reputaÂ«
tion. This is what you might expect from
the author of "Tue La"!
Moral Three. That a whitÂ© man (Sir
Cbiehester Frayne) who resides for some
years among a primitive people (the West
Afrlcane) Is likely to revert to a primitive
morality of the anthropoid type.
Moral Four. That "a good deal of
Champagne underneath a lot of whisky"
(e-ot IV) is bad for biliously inclined
people.
Moral FlvÂ«. That no honorable
tnan (Captain Bastllng), having plighted
Jiis faith to one pretty girl (Muriel), will
make love to another (Sophy). If he does,
he Is likely to lose both, and serve him
right.
Moral Six. Palmistry is charlatanism
and a "professor" thereof (Valma) is in
danger of come day finding himself "in
the police court, alongside a poor old wo.
roan whose hand has been crossed with a
threepenny bit -down an area" (act II).
Mora! Seven. That an engaged couple
eTioiiid not ride In a cab, for if they do.
when they leave the cab they are likely
to forget their luggage; then one of them
(Valma) must run back for it. and while
lie is running back for it the ether party
aforesaid (Sophy) may, with the best in
tentions in tho world, become involved In
a complication that shall lead to an ab
ruptly comic or abruptly tragic termina
tion of the aforesaid engagement.
Moral Eight. That (to use Dumas*
phrase) to say good-by for the last time
severed times (the Duchess of Strood.
Quex) Is a bad policy that leads to dan
gerous consequences.
Moral Nine. That women who say they
read books like "Les Aventures de Ma
dame Plon" for their "style" are frauds.
Moral Ten (counterpart to Moral Four).
Every young irjdy (Muriel) who puts her
fiance (Quex) upon probation is herself
upon probation. Bhe must no more flirt
I understand that Mr. Frohman has
promised to send us this play with other
new plays next cummer. He must send
us some very good actors at the same
time, or the seeing thereof will be less
pleasurable than the reading thereof in
Mr. Russell's beautiful edition. Quex la
an extremely difficult part to act. There
are not more than three or four men in
the United Statesâ among them Mr. Mans
field and Mr. Millerâ who could do it ad
equately. Sophy Fullgarney, too, a bour
geois tragedy-queen, .equlres In the act
ress a rare combination of refinement
(which must be innate in the imperson
ator, and of commonness (assumed from
a close study of the English girl of the
people).
As a piece of dramatic construction Mr.
Pinero's play Is almost perfect. In this
respect there Is no English-speaking
writer who holds even a good second place
to him. Every character has a meaning
and an appropriate place in the action;
every incident is properly motivated.
Take, for instance, the strong love scene
between Valma and Sophy, with which
the play opens. Such a scene In such a
place is a daring experiment, for it would
eeem as if it must lead to an anti-climax.
Yet that scene is planned with direct
reference to the last scene of the third
act, the climatic scene of the play.
Without the one the other would lose haif
its force. Had we not been shown that
Valma and Sophy are honestly and deep
ly in love with each other, had we not
been warned of Valma's jealous disposi
tion, wo could not fully realize Sophy'a
anguish when she finds that she has
placed herself in a position where she
must sacrifice her lover to save her
friend. - *
A friend for whose judgment I have
much respect 'maintains that In the per
bon of Muriel Eden Mr. Plnero Intended to
portray a truly lovelv woman, an ideal
heroine, but that he has failed in his at
tempt, being unable to conceive even the
loveliest woman as capabla of resisting
the temptation to have two strings to her
bow. But did ho attempt to make Muriel
an ideal heroine any more than did Mr.
Ford attempt to make Janice Meredith?
Does he not rather intend a subtle satire
upon his hero, Quex, who thinks that he
is going to marry an angel but who
really gets only a girl prevented by tha
merest accident from running off with
another man?
When the play came out in England
Eome Bishop tock Mr. Pinoro severely to
task. Surely his lordship cannot have
read the play; had he done so he must
have discovered, even on a first reading,
all the morals which I have pointed out
and a closer study would have revealed
to him more.
Moral Twelve. That "in this life, if you
have anything to pardon, pardon quickly.
Slew forgiveness is little better than no
forgiveness," "What could be better?
with gallant captains than must he with
duchesses.
Moral Eleven. That the well-intentioned
action of the Jgrnorant often does more
harm th?n the evil-lntentioned action of
the educated. This sociological paradox
Is maintained by phllrsophers who differ
as widely as do Matthew Arnold and Her
bert Spencer, and of this paradox Sophy
Fullsarney, In Mr. Pinero'e play. Is a
striking: illustration.

Thomas E. Watson, who was the can
didate for Vice President on the Populist
ticket in 1896, is. still before the public,
but as a historian instead of a politician,
relates the Saturday Evening Post.
A few years ago Mr. Watson Invited
"Bill Arp," Major Charles H. Smith, to
lecture in his town. . Major Smith does
not make a business.of lecturing, but he
is none the less an attractive and enter
taining speaker. All the countryside
turned out to hear "Bill Arp," and Mr.
Watson was very busy making arrange
ments. Managing a lecture was new to
Mr. Watson, and he consulted Major
Smith concerning all the details, and was
anxious that he should not forget any
thing. Everything pointed to success.
The house was filled and the lecture was
well received. But the people kept their

taken his seat, and showed no inclination

gan to grow ominous, the audience began
to leave in groups, with an expression of
querulous amusement on their faces.
Watson was a puzzled witness to this
proceeding. Turning to Major Smith he
asked In a. hoarse whisper: "Major, did
I forget anything?"
"Yes, you forgot something, Tom," said
a man who had lingered in the hall.
"You forgot to provide a doorkeeper, and
not one of these people paid any admis

China's Coal Fields.
China contains some of the richest' coal
deposits in the world. Last fall Professor
Drake of Tientsin, visited the coal fields
in the province of Shansi. which were ex
amined by Baron von Richthofen in 1S70,
and found that they are of Immense ex
tent. Tho coal area Is said to be greater
than that of Pennsylvania and the anthra
cite cftal alone contained In these fields
haa been estimated at 630.000,000 tons. The
Shansi coal beds are so thick and He 80
uniformly in a horizontal position that the
practicability has been suggested of run
ning long lines of railroad tunnels through
the beds so that the cars can be loaded
in the mines all ready for distant trans
portation.âYouth's Companion.

BT. PAUL, Minn., Dec. 22.â A suit in
volving several millions of dollars, the
value of the telegraph lines along the
route of the Great Northern road from
St. Paul to the Pacific coast, was decided
to-day by Judge Lochren In the Unlt<rd
States District Court in favor of tho de
fendant, the Western Union Telegraph
Company. Its Importance, however, was
not alone in the amount of money in
volved, for it was the general- understand
ing that should the railway company have
won, all the great railway systems of the
country would, at the expirations of tholr
contracts with the Western Union Te'.e
graph Company, have claimed the owner
ship of the telegraph lines along their
right of ways, and either have operated
them independently or else formed a con
solidation which -would have been a
strong competitor In the telegraphic field.
PORT OF BOAC
ORDERED CLOSED
The suit was brought by the St. Paul,
Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway Com
pany (now the Great Northern) against
the Western Union Telegraph Company
and the Nor+hwestern Telegraph Com
pany, whose lines are now controlled by
the Western Union Company. In 1S79 the
Northwestern Company built a telegraph
line along the right of way of the plain
tiff, road, and in 1SS2. 1537 miles of 'line had
been constructed. The same year the
Northwestern Company sold out to the
Western Union, the consideration being
11.800,0)0, together with a yearly rental of
$150,000 for a term of ninety-nine years.
Contracts had been entered into between
the railway company and the telegraph
company in 1879 and again in 1S82. by
which, among other things, the telegraph
company was to supply wires, poles, etc.,
and the railway company to furnish trans
portation and labor for the construc
tion of the lines, and the railway company
was to furnish the operators. The case
turns upon the construction of these con
tracts.
The plaintiff insisted that the defendant
company had no ownership in the tele
graph lines, except an Interest as a Joint
owner, and asked that the defendant be
obliged to accept the value thereof and
relinquish the lines to the Great North
ern Company.
On the other hand, tho telegraph com
pany claimed to have a clear and unmis
takable title to the property in question,
through the contracts it had acquired by
reason of its absorption of the North
western Company.' The suit has been
pending since JW7. I
The judge held that the rights of both
parties were the same at the expiration
of- the contracts as they were during the
operation of the contracts. The court al
lowed no costs in the case for either side.

POLICE ON TRAIL
OF KIDNAPERS
NEW YORK. Dec. 22.-Mrs. Elizabeth
Lung, an attractive young woman, who
said she was the wife of a. naval officer,
told a story, of having been drugged and
robbed In a Seventh-avenue Raines* law
hotel, which raised doubts as to its accu
racy In the mind of Magistrate Zeller to
day in the Jefferson Market Police Court.
Mrs. Lung said she was visiting friends
on West Seventeenth street, and that jn
her way home Thursday evening she had
stopped at an oyster booth at Seventeenth
street and Seventh avenue and had eaten
some oysters. As she was leaving a man
spoke to her. Although he was a stran
ger, she saw no harm in accompanying
him to a saloon at the corner of Vi e=st
Twenty-fifth street and Seventh avenue.
There she had one drink ajid remembered
nothing more until she awoke in a room
over the saloon. Her fur! boa and cape,
given her by her husband, iwere gone, and
her gold cuff buttons and purse were gone
also. William Courtney, an owner of sev
eral cabs, was accused by Mrs. Lung or
having drugged and robbed her. Mr.
Ccurtney produced bankbooks in court
which showed that he had more than 17000
in different savings institutions of this
city.- He said that he had never seen Mrs.
Lung until her appearance In court, ana
denied ever having drunk with her.
As Mrs. Lung gave several conflicting
addresses, at all of which was un
known. Magistrate Zeller dismissed her
charge atralnst Mr. Courtney. .
Dispatches from San Francisco In July,
1S99 stated that Surgeon George A. Lung,
United States navy, had brought proceed
ings in divorce from his wife, who among
other things was accused of having beon
intoxicated at a Hag-raising in Honolulu
and with having created a disturbance on
board the cruiser Philadelphia, on which
Lung was stationed.
Mrs. Lung will be remembered In San
Franci3co as the former wife of Dr.
George A. Lung, surgeon of the United
States cruiser Philadelphia. Lung se
cured a divorce from the woman in this
city in November, 1S!O, on the ground of
habitual intemperance. Witnesses from
Port Royal, the Hawaiian Islands and
Norfolk navy yard and this city were
taken into court to substantiate the
plaintiff's charges. No provision for ali
mony was made, but Dr. Lung voluntarily
agreed to pay. Mrs. Lung $30 a, month as
long as she required that sum for her
maintenance.

The new Central Theater was formally i
opened last evening in a production of
David Belasco's stirring war drama, "The
Heart of Maryland." Messrs. Belasco and
Thall are to be congratulated, for the Cen
tral is one of the coziest and best ar
ranged amusement houses in the city.
The doors of the theater were thrown
open shortly after 7 o'clock, in order to
accommodate those who desired to take
In the beauties of the new theater before'
the performance beg-an. The main en
trance to the Central is not yet completed,
but when finished will embrace an elabor
ate foyer, with marble steps and hand
some mirrors on each side. On enterirsf
the theater one is at once struck by the
pleasing, comfortable appearance of the
interior. On the ground floor the whole '
space is oc-cupied by orchestral scats, with .
the exception of a broad promenade walk
twelve leet or more wide. The. second
floor is devoted to a parquet circle. There
are twelve proscenium boxes, handsomely
draped and curtained. The Interior of the
theater is decorated in cream color and
the ceillngrs are frescoed with a bold Cu r
pid design. The stage is one of the larg
est In this city and is 53 by 95 feet. The
dressing-rooms are large, neatly furnished
and, last but not least, well ventilated,
which is a rare thing in our local thea
ters.
The theater has a seating capacity of
2000, but the architect of the building took
special pains in preparing his plans to In
sure patrons a good view of the stage
from any part of the house.
On each floor there are numerous exits,
with illuminated signs over them, and in
case of an alarm of fire the house could
be emptied in an incredibly short time.
Last evening the house was taxed to
its utmost capacity and the performance
passed off without a hitch.
The large, cast necessary for the pro
duction of the big military melodrama ex
hibited most of the members of the ad
mirable stock company, which the new
theater has gathered together, and which
Includes some old favorites and many
new faces. Among the former are How
ard Hall, late leading man of the Al
cazar Theater; Clarence T. Arper, another
light orthe Alcazar; Krpest Howell, (who
has done good work there also; Stanley
Ross and George Nichols. Margaret Mar
shall is an old Morosco favorite. The other
ladles In the cast, including the leading
lady. Miss Effle Darling, are new to us,
and Miron Lefflrjgwell, an important mem
ber of the company, and also stage direc
tor is another importation.
"The Heart of Maryland" was well put
on, admirably staged, and surprisingly
well acted. The first scene "was subject
to the interruptions of a crowd which had
not learned Its way about, but the per
formance went with remarkable smooth
ness. The audience was intimately appre
ciative and sympathetic, in the good, old,
all-in-the-family fashion, and in the bel
fry scene gave curtain call after curtain
call to the actors who had won its favor.
Miss Effle Darling, who is an actress
much above the commÂ»n caliber of the
stock company artist, inevitably suggests
Leslie Carter inÂ»the leading role. She has
the voice, the little tricks, almost even the
Titian locks of her predecessor, whose
three weeks at the Baldwin Theater in
the role Is still remembered. Miss Darling
has much emotional power, a. graceful
presence, a good voice, and has already
proved herself a valuable member of the
new company. Of Howard Hall it is un
necessary to say more than that his role
as the melodramatic hero. Colonel Alan
Kendrick, suits him admirably. Clarence
T. Arper has a good opportunity as the
Southern General. Hugh Kendrick, and is
most successful In" Its Interpretation.
Miron Letflngwell received an ovation for
his good work as the spy. Colonel Thorp,
and fairly reveled in the unctuous villainy
of the part.
Miss Marshall, Miss Bartlett and Miss
Waldrop were well heard in their respect
ive parts, and Charles Arthur, Louis Bel
mour, William Lee Greenleaf, Stanley
Ross, Ernest Howell, Frank Opperman,
George Nichols, Jack Morris and the rest
of the large cast all filled acceptably their
several roles.
The play was well staged and cos
tumed, and if the initial high level of the
performance Is maintained the new thea
ter should be a distinct success. The
acoustics seem to be all that can be de
sired, from any point in the large house,
which is pretty, comfortable and well
ventilated.
TTis Alhambra,
After belli? closed for five nights the
Alhambra Theater reopened last evening
with Broadhursfs "gleeful plenitude,"
"Why Smith Left Home." The theater
wks well filled and the audience had no
reasons for regret. Although the com
pany presenting the play Is not as strong
as the one seen here last season in the
Fame Â¦work. It Is certainly one worthy of
support and should draw large houses for
the entire engagement. Douglas Flint, Eu
geno Redding. Gus Mortimer. Frederick
Koberta and. Frank 'Craven portray the
melo characters with finish, while Blanche
Everson, Nellie Maskell, -Bessie Bruns,
Eleanor La Salle. Ella Aubey and Lizzie
May Ulmor take good care In playing the
female roles. The entire performance
shows careful training on the part of the
Payers. ...

How frequently you hear people com-
plain of "only a slight case or piles," oft-
en claiming that the trouble Ls merely
temporary, induced by costivenees or sed-
entary habits.
It may be some satisfaction to console
yourself In this way, but it ls much better
to check the trouble at once. You can't
do it too soon.
In time these little rectal tumors will
grow from the size of a crape seed, until
a knot of them results as large as pigeons'
eggs.
These become Inflamed and tender to
the touch and causing Itching, stinging
and throbbing pain.
Thus the disease continues from bad to
worse, until the patient can bear the an-
noyance no longer.
The Pyramid Pile Cure Is a perfectly safe
and cÂ«rtaln cure for piles In any of these
stages. It goes to the very source of the
trouble and drives out all Inflammation,
causing the tumors to subside and the
membranes to resume their normal,
healthy condition.
Piles lead to too many complications to
trifle with every remedy that comes alone.
People have found It pays to use a stand-
ard remedy like the Pyramid Pile Cure,
which for ten years haa been tested. In

Physicians use the Pyramid Pile Cure in
preference to surgical operations, because
they know it contains no cocaine, mor-

THB SOUTHERN PACIFIC
EDWARD KANE, alias Davis, alias
Harding, a young artful man from
New York. Is In "the tanks" at
the City Prison on suspicion of
having committed quite a number
of thefts of valuable diamonds by prac
ticing the familiar "palm" trick. It la
estimated by the police that the amount
of his stealings for the past two months
will aggregate over $2000.
The police had been notified that a
thief was operating In the Jewelry stores,
but It was not till December 1 that Cap
tain Seymour got a clew as to the identity
of the thief. He went Into H. Meyers' <
diamond house on Butter street, near
Kearny, on' that day and asked to see
Bome diamonds. He did not buy any dia
monds, as they did not suit him. but after
he had left It was discovered that a dia
mond pin and a lady's diamond brooch
were missing. Meyers reported the theft
to the police and Detectives Harper and
Armstrong were detailed on the case.
Meyers waa able to give an accurate de
scription of the man who wanted to look ]
at the diamonds, and soon the detectives
became susnicious of Kane. They shad
owed him and followed him to a number
of Jewelry stores and also discovered that
he roomed at 9 Powell street. They de
tailed Policeman Mulcahey to wa.tch the
Powell-street house, and Friday night
Court Ruling That the Railway Com
pany Seems Disposed to
Ignore.
SANTA BARBARA, Dec. 22,-Judgo
Day In the Superior Court, to-day ren
dered his decision In the Injunction case
of John F. More against the Southern
Pacific, granting a permanent Injunction.
Some weeks ago the company began the
removal of Its tracks and fences from the
old right-of-way on the Elwood line on
the completion of the newly built short
cut along: the coast survey. When the
More ranch was reached a temporary In
junction was Issued to. prevent this re
moval. The work has not been stopped
and the Southern Pacific officials said no
attention would be paid to the Injunction.
The case came up for a hearing: this
morning and the court decided that the
fences along the old right-of-way should
not be disturbed and granted a permanent
Injunction. The case will no doubt be
carried to the Supreme Court-
Mulcahey arrested Kane and locked him
up In the tanks at the City Prison.
The detectives In the meantime had re
covered about $2000 worth of diamonds
that had been stolen and pawned by
Kane. He had operated in the stores of
Shrevo & Co^ W. A. Vanderslice and
others. From Shreve's he stole a diamond
locket valued at 115 and from Vanderslice
a diamond pin and diamond collar button,
which have been recovered and identified.
The articles stolen from Meyers have also
been identified and Captain Seymour has
a number of articles of Jewelry in his pos
session which await Identification.
Kane declares that he got all the jewel
ry from a blond* woman he met on Mar
ket street. He says he made a "mash"
and she gave him the jewelry to pawn,
as she wanted to bet on the races, where
he frequently met her. 'He knew her as
Miss Nelson, but he did not know her
surname nor where she lived. He got a
liberal dlscoont from her for pawning the
diamonds and she also gave him the pawn
tickets, which he sold, but he could not
say to whom he sold them. The detectives
say that they followed him closely for
weeks, but they never saw a woman In
his company and they do not believe his
story.
K.ane was taken to the police gallery to
be photographed, but he squirmed and
twisted so much that It took nearly an
hour before a good negative of him could
be taken. The police believe that he is not
unaccustomed to posing before the crim
inal camera.
ALLEGED CROOK CAPTURED BY THE POLICE. WHO IS BELIEVED TO
BE THE MAN "WHO HAB ROBBED SEVERAL JEWELJtY FIRMS OF
THIS CITY BY THE "PALM" TRICK.
The Police Commissioners held a con
ference with the Police Court Judges yes
terday afternoon, and with the assistance
of Mayor Phelan and Chief of Police Sui
ltvan explained their project of licensing
gramblir.g In Chinatown and putting
houses of ill fame under police Eupervi
6ior~ The meeting was executive.
At the close of the meeting Mayor Phe
lan made a statement to the representa
tive* of the press about the new move
ment srA appeared to be enthusiastic over
Its results.
The plan is as follows: All gambling
Â¦vrill be allowed in Chinatown, for which
the proprietors of the games must pay a
regular monthly license to the police. The
collecting of the money will be done In.
fines. About once a month the proprietor
of the gambling house will be arrested
and charged with conducting a gambling
house. His bail will be rixed at from $50
to 5100. This bail will be forfeited and In
a month's time the police will be again on
Ms trail.
Any Chinese gambling house proprietor
who elects to fight the case In the courts
will be considered outside the pale and his
house will be immediately closed by the
police.
The Police Judges 6aid yesterday both at
the meeting ana afterward to the press
representatives that should a Chinaman
be arrested and fall to appear in court
{_-.<-. the police refused to prosecute tho
case they would be powerless to act and
that the bail would be forfeited.
In the case of the houses of 111 repute
the Commissioners intend to have the pro
prietors pay a regular monthly tax. The
landladies will also be required every
month to furnish the police with a com
plete list of ail the inmates of their
houses. Thfe police think that in this way
they could eret a line on tbe women, and
that if any young girls entered theÂ©Â«
houses it would be very easy to detect
them and Induce them to reform. The
idea of medical supervision has not been
i>eriously considered.
The Police Commissioners claim that In
the history of San Francisco Chinese
carnbling iias never been stopped and that
it is impossible to stop it, that tbe Chl
nÂ«-Fe ere ignorant heathen and that if
they care to gamble the whole world is
untble to suppress them; that the China
town equad is a great expense to the city,
t:.. ; . that e\ ery time the polica raid a den
they stand a chance of being entangled-
In a big damage suit for destroying prop
erty. After due consideration they have
concluded that tho best thing that can be
done ie to let the Chinaman gamble, but
make him pay dearly for the sport
After the meeting yesterday afternoon
the Mayor had this to 6ay:
"I want you to understand that this is
no new idea, but is at present working In
b. number of the foremost cities in the
United States. Pittsburg, Minneapolis,
Cincinnati. Portland. Or.. Tacoma and
Seattle ail have adopted this way of
handling the question and it has proved
moet successful. The Chinatown squad
coets the city J30.OO0 a year. The Mon
golians are ignorant persons and it la im
possible to educate them. If they are al
lowed to gamble they will pay in fines to
thf city over IKtf.OOO annually. This money
could go toward the better equipment of
the police force or toward public im
provements. "With the dollar limit on tax
fetlon the city Is handicapped by being
rhort of funCs. If this revenue was com
ing In it would be most beneficial to the
city. In jefcard to the houses of ill fame.
If they wore licensed they would be unlor
police supervision and protection. Tho
police could then dictate where the heuÂ«*Â«
rhoulrt be located and they could be gath
ered* in any part of town that the police
thoug-ht advisable. I have tpoken to a
number of the clergy on the subject and
they say that they know that this city has
many evils and that the best and wl<?e*t
means should be taken to handle thÂ« evils,
but thet we ehould not close our eyes to
this subject and ignore It entirely."

Supervisors Favor TJse of Privilege
for Two Blocks on Second and

Other Lines.
The committee agreed with Troy in his
contention, and directed the clerk to draw
up an amended ordinance, in which the
conditions enumerated will be Incorpor
ated. The ordinance in Its amended form
will be resubmitted to the committee and
the officials of the company will be noti
fied to appear before it on Friday, Jan
uary 3, 1901. â¢
The second condition Is that all other
street railroad companies be allowed the
use of the tracks upon the conditions pro
vided in the charter in order to reach the
Southern Pacific terminal at Fourth and
Townsend streets. E. P. E. Troy, secre
tary of the Richmond Improvement Club,
made a strong protest against . granting
the Market Street Railway Company a
monopoly of the approaches to the depot.
He argued that in a short ..time the com
pletion of the shore line would result in
enormous travel coming in at Fourth and
Townsend streets, and it would be an in
justice to shut out other companies from
the privilege.deslred by the Market-street
company,- which already controls two of
the approaches on Third., and Fourth
streets. .^
The franchise applied for by the Market
Street Railway Company to operate a
double track on two blocks of Second and
Townaend streets to connect the
and Brannan streets lines will not be
granted without certain conditions being
Imposed on the corporation. This much
was decided On. by the Supervisors* Joint
Committee on Judiciary and Streets, to
which the application was referred for
consideration. Â»
The first condition to be imposed will be
that the, company will be required to keep
the pavement- on the two blocks In good
repair from curb to curb Instead of for
two feet on each side of the rails, as was
formerly the custom. These repairs must
be made under the supervision and to the
satisfaction of the Board of Public Works.
This condition was â¢ suggested by Praun
hart- when . the matter nrst-came up be
fore the board, and was accepted. by the
committee. ' -

The other deputies In tbe office Who are
not on the eligible list are William A. Val

and F. M. J. Kelly, and their tenure of
office is in Jeopardy. Scott declines to
etate what he proposes to do In the case
of his denuties. He has notified the com
mission that he will appoint seventeen ex
perienced clerks from the eligible list an
nounced three days ago. The first three
names were certified for one position, but
no selection has yet been -made. The
eligible list for deputies follows, with the
individual percentag-es:

If the civil service provision of the char
ter is strictly adhered to, at least twelve
deputies in Tax Collector Scott's office are
in danger of losing their positions on
January 1, 1901. The Civil Service Com
mission announced the eligible list for
those positions yesterday^ and It shows
that only three out of the fifteen 'deputies
at present employed in the office are high
enough up in percentage to Insure their
reappointment. The lucky three are Ben
I. Salomon. J. K. Jones and J. "VV. Mc-
Cabe. .Two ' others who passed, Edward
J. Casey and William T. Howe, are not
high enough. to be certificated with .the
first seventeen certificated for the fifteen
positions by the commission.
Five deputies in the office declined to
take the examination. They, are Harry
Baehr, Herman Enkle, George Fiddes, J.
H. Nelson and John G. Fltzg-erald. This
is taken as an Indication that resistance
will be made to any attempt made by the
Civil Service Commission to supplant
these five by civil service eliglbles. Scott
himself said that he would have some
thing to say when It came to a' point of
removing his deputies, but what; that
something is he declines to tell at pres

Chinatown is In the delights of a grand
celebration and punksticks and firecrack
ers are the order of the day.
Yesterday was a red-letter day in the
Oriental quarter, for "Quon Fu Gee," the
powerful Joss of tie Sam Yup Society,
was honored in the new quarters of the
society at 929 Dupont street. More than
$40,000 was expended in fitting up the place
and the value of the decorations and
furniture is estimated at J150.000.
A. walk through the new Josshouso and
headquarters is like a realization of a
page from the "Arabian Nights," for on
all sides the visitor is surrounded by the
most expensive articles dear to the sons
of Confucius. The walls are adorned with
rich silk curtains, with designs worked in
gold and silver threads. Sliver and gold
ornaments worth a. kind's ransom- are
filled with flowers on the altar In front of
the mighty "Quon Fu Gee." The richest
fruits In the market are spread before the
loss, and the Sam Yup Society is burning
hundreds of dollars' worth of sandal-wood
in honor of the Joes and bis new home.
Furniture of valuable woods Is scattered
through tho many rooms; electrio lights
blase from all points of the building;
rlohly burnished spears are stacked
against the walls; beautifully carved lan
terns hang from the ceilings, and the
shimmer of the lights is reflected in the
handsome stained glass windows. The
top floor of the building is devoted to the
"Josshouse" and members' rooms, while
the first floor is taken up with lounging
rooms, smoking rooms and offices.
. - Commencing at midnight Thursday the
Sam Yups grathered together j to honor
their Joss. A great fusilade of firecrack
ers continued all night and all yesterday
until evening.
The high officials of the Six Companies
met at their headquarters yesterday and
marched in procession to tha new Sara
Yup quarters to pay their respects. In
the morning Consul How Yow, who is a
Sam Yup man, opened the Josshouse, wlm
the assistance of sixty priests dressed
in colored gowns. A Chinese orches
tra started in to play on Thursday
night and will not cease until to-morrow
morning. Thousands of Sam Yuns-vis
ited the new quarters and . Joy , reigns In
the hearts of the ten thousand members
of tho "society, which comprises the best
element in Chinatown. Tha lobbies of the
building are covered with the- red paper
ellps used by the Chinese for business
purposes. Each slip represents a member
of the Sam Yup Society and beam his
name, clan, residence and the amount of
his donation to the fund of the society.
Consul General How. Yow heads 'Â¦ the list
with $500, similar eums being donated by
the merchants, whllo the rank and file
came to the front with sums ranging from
$25 to $2. Â¦ .

CTJPIB'S BUSY HOLIDAY
SEASON AT WOODLAUD
An Indian known as Tommy was on
trial for having threatened the life of a
man whom he claimed had defrauded him
out of $1. The fellow had promised Tommy
that if the latter left Jl m a certain spot
he would receive in exchange a bottle of
whisky. Tommy deposited his dollar, and
later when he went to get the whisky he
found neither the coin nor the bottle.
Then he sought out the man who had
cheated him and tried to shoot him. The
pistol snapped and bystanders disarmed
the Indian.
The case had gone to the jury, and the
twelve men. in doubt as to a portion of
the evidence, came into court to have It
reread to them. Mr. Spencer, as attorney
for the defense, interrupted the reading
several times and tinally the court threat
ened to commit him for contempt.
Tnis aroused the Ire of the old lawyer.
In forcible language he declared he had
lived In Susanville forty years, that he
had ntver bt-en in Jail and>never expected
to be, and there were not enough men in
town to put him behind the bars. Then
the Judge ordered the Sheriff to imprison
Spencer. The lawyer wielded his cane
lustily, ar.d it took the combined efforts
of three men to put him under lock and
key. Kach of the three showed marks of
the encounter. After the attorney had
b**"n In prison one hour the court relented
and restored him to freedom.
Judge Kelly and Attorney Spencer have
been enemies for some time. A year ago
they came to blows in the Judge's cham
bers and for some time thereafter the at
torney was debarred from legal practice.
It Is feared that the feud may lead to a
more serious claBh between the two. ' *
EUSANVILLE, Dec 22.-Hon. E. V.
Spencer spent one hour In the county Jail
yesterday. His Incarceration was the re
sult of" an exciting episode in Superior
Judge Kelly's court. Mr. Spencer was
sentenced to twenty-four hours" impris
onment for contempt, but before the edict
of the court could be carried into effect
he gave the Sheriff and two assisting of
ficers a lively time.
"Wields His Cane Vigorously in an
Effort to Prevent His IncarciT

IN COUNTY JAIL
SAN JOSE. Dec. 22.â Four children
cf Conrad Rueff. a dairyman, per
ished this morning in a fire that
destroyed their home; two others
were badly burned, one perhaps
seriously, and the father's hands were
blistered by the- flames. The mother. In
delicate health, with a three weÂ»ks old
babe in her arms, was rescued through
a window. The house, an old landmark,
of wood lined with cloth. 6"urned like a
tinderbox, acd that the mother, the babe
and the two other children were saved
was due to the heroic efforts of the hus
band and William Valdez, & hired man.
Rueff. who had come from Germany
about eight months ago, conducted the
Golden West Dairy, at the corner of Al
vlso road and Hamline street, two miles
north of San Jose. A few days ego he
diFpoÂ«ed of the dairy to ills brother. Carl
Rueff, and the family was preparing to
go back to Germany after the holidays.
For some time Mrs. Rueff has been in
delicate health, and a fire has been kept
in the stove most of the night. The stove
pipe passed through the cloth ceiling, and
It was in this point of contact the flre
started.
Rueff and his hired man arise shortly
before 3 o'clock ever}' morning to milk
the cows. This morning they were a little

everywhere.
Mrs. Rueff. who was the second wife of
her husband, was the stepmother of all
the children except the babe. She is at
the home of her brother's sister and 1Â»
prostrated by grief. Louis and Mary are
at the O'Connor Sanitarium. The boy Is
not very badly burned, but the girl may
die. All of the children were born In Ger
many, where their mother died two years
aeo. i
the new County Jail is at a standstill.
Nine stonecutters and several teamsters
and quarrymen assembled Â«t 3 o'clock
this afternoon to draw their wages, but
were unable to get a cent. They had
agreed to quit work if they were not paid
to-day. Two installments have been paid
to Contractor John Goggio. aggregating
$1300, but during the ten weeks his men
have worked on thÂ» building- and a longer
time at the quarries they have received
nothing. It was understood when the
men quit to-day that if they were paid
in full before Christmas they would re
turn to work after the holidays.
The four children that were burned to
death were: Carl, aged 10: Katie, aged
9; Barbara, aged 7, and Conrad, aged 6.
They were probably suffocated and never
awakened to realize the horrible death
that was upon them. All occupied one
bed. and side by side the charred remains
were found on a wire mattress. A chim
ney had toppled over upon them. The
bodies were burned beyond recognition.
Coroner Kell was notified and the re
mains were removed to the Morgue. This
afternoon an Inquest was held, and a ver
dict of death by accidental burning ren
dered. The story of the fire and the loss
of life was told at the inquest by William
Valdez, the hired man. who was the only
material witness.
death. Valdez grabbed him and dragged
him back, but not before he wa* badly
burned about the hands. By this time
neighbors were on the scene, and It took
the efforts of several men to restrain the
father from rushing to his death in the
effort to save his children.
In less than twenty minutes the house,
had been consumed. \ and nothing re
mained but a smoldering 1 pile of ashes.

The heavy rains of the last week had
raised the water so high that It was im
possible to hold the boat. The cable broke
and the boat went down stream and be
came a total wreck. This closes this road
and all travel will be compelled to go by
way of Laytonville.
The others could not be awakened and
the flames drove Valdea from the window.
He then went around to the front of the
house. Here Rueff. In a state of frenzy,
was trying to get his wife out. The win.
dow of her room on the northeast side
was broken In. and finally the woman,
with the infant in her arms, was rescued.
Rueff then tried to enter the front door
to get to the other children. He broke
the door In and was about to enter the
seething furnace, which meant instant
late. The men had been milking but a
few minutes, when the screams of Mrs.
Rueff called them from the barn. They
found the kitchen ablaze, with flames
bursting from the roof and window. A
rush was made for the kitchen door, but
the fire drove them back. An attempt wis
then made to arouse the children. RuenT
rushed around to the front of the house
looking for his wife, while Valdez went
to the window of the room occupied by
the children. Here the six little ones were
sleeping, four of the youngest in one bed
and two in another couch. He broke the
window In. The room was full of smoke
and the flames could be seen eating their
way through the paper-like partitions.
The smoke had evidently rendered the
youngest unconscious.
Valdez succeeded in rousing Mary, aged
12. and Louis, aged 13, and these ho
dragged through the window. The girl
was badly burned about the hands, face
and back and her recovery Is doubtful.
Louis' ha,nds were burned* and hi? face
scorched.

and started to g*t up. Then I hit him and

In the County Jail Higgins spoke freely

But a Poor ICedicine.
Common soda is all right In Its place
and indlspenslble In the kitchen and for
cooking and washing purposes, but soda
waÂ« never intended for medicine, and peo-
ple who use it aa euch will some day
regret It.
The common usÂ© ct soda, to relieve heart-
burn and sour stomach Is a habit which
thousands of people practice almost dally,
aud one which is fraught with danger.
Soda gives only temporary relief, and In
the end the stomach trouble gets worse
and worse.
The soda act* as a mechanical irritant
to the walls of the stomach and bowels,
and cases are on record where It accumu-
lates in the intestines, causing death by
Inflammation or peritonitis.
Dr. Harlandton recommends as the
safest and eurest cure for sour stomach
(acid dyspepsia) the dally use after meals
of an excellent preparation, sold by
druggist* under the name of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets. These tablets are
large i>-craln lozenpes, pleasant- to the
taEte and containing natural peptcnes
and digestive elements necessary to good
di*r<-suon. and which all weak stomachs
lack.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets used reru-
larly after meals digest the food prompt-
ly and thoroughly before it has time to
ferment, sour and poison the blood and
nervous system.
Dr. Wuerth states that he invariably
uses and recommends Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets in ail forms of stomach derange-
ment, and finds them a certain cure not
only for sour stomach, but by causlns
prompt digestion of the food they create
a healthy appetite. Increase flesh and
strengthen the action of the heart and
liver.
They are not a cathartic and contain no
violent drug, but are Intended only for
stomach diseases and faulty digestion, and
generally acknowledged to be the most
reliable cure for any stomach trouble,
except cancer of the stomach.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets now enjoy
an international reputation and popular-
ity, and are sold by drugjrists everywhere
In the United States, Canada and Great
Britain.

Mr. Delmas â Very well. It Is not entire
ly material to the point. The point re
mains. This Is a suit to recover damages
for an Injured' reputation. It is not in
jured to toe extent of honesty or Integ
rity In business dealings. Nobody has
charged him with being a thief or an em
bezzler. The particular trait of reputa
tion which Is claimed to have been dam
aged by this article Is the trait which
would spring from personal chastity or
continence of conduct, the converse or
which would be profligacy _*o far as thd
other sex is concerned. Where is there
a single witness who has come forward
to testify that the implication from Mr.
Perkins' testimony that he at least had
stated to Mr. Leake that the Haron's
r< puation herÂ© in tha.1 respect was. very
I jji ilirrr is there a sing!" witness who
hep come forward to say that the Baron's
r.^rma* 1011 ln tJl8t r^"V iC * ls not very
b*d?
he gave Mr. Leake, so that we might
have Mr. Leake's position at the time of
the publication, and that was my under
standing of the testimony.
The Courtâ My ruling upon Mr. Perkins'
testimony. Mr. Delmas, was that he
might testify as to any information that
Mr. Delmasâ (Reading.) "His reputa
tion In regard to women was very bad, in
dÂ«?ed." And the construction put upon
that language at the time. If your Honor
please, was what? Was that Perkins ha-1
no right to say eo? No; that the defend
ant had no right to prove the specific
traits of reputation of the plaintiff. While
he might go Into general reputation, he
could not select profligacy as a specific
point of reputation.
The Courtâ Judge Maguire stated that
Mr. Perkins testified that he informed Mr.
I^ake that the general reputation was
bad In this particular. But he did not
himself testify as to the fact, but simply
testified as to informing Mr. Leake, and
the testimony was admitted for that pur
pose.
Mr. Delmasâ You may be Jast, Judge.
but you certainly are not generous. This.
If your Honor please. Is the testimony as
given us In the official record. I read
from rase 75: "I then told Mr. Leake
that the Baron'e reputation In the town
<->f Ban Rafael, during the period I had
bf>en here. I had lf.arned to be very bad."
The Courtâ That Is my recollection of
the testimony. That is what I stated.
Mr. Delmas- Tour Honor will pardon
me, I am not quite through.
The Courtâ Yes, sir.
Mr. Delmas â (Reading.) "In regard to ,
rnp fubjr-ct. I told n!m that I had never
yi^ard th* 1 Baron's honesty or integrity in
l'UFir.e-Fs questioned, but his reputation In
rogrard to women was very bad. Indeed."
The Courtâ That Is correct, sir.
Mr- Delmas â (Rradlng.) "Mr. Maguire"
âshowing that your Honor understood it
as counsel understood It, and &s we un
â¢iorstood itâ "we move to strike out the
an^w-es upon the ground that it Is not ad
misfible and Is Improper under any cir
cumstances. Testimony concerning: the
K^neral reputation of the plaintiff may be
given In evidence by the defendant, but
Jt is settled that evidence of reputation
for particular qualities or elements of
character or conduct are not admissible.
The Court â The motion Is denied."
The Courtâ Correct, sir.
Mr. Delrnas â Is not that testimony of
Mr. von Schroeder's reputation?
The Courtâ I understand that is correct
Mr. Perkins did not himself testify as to
the reputation, but he testified aa to in
forming Mr. Ijoake.
Mr. Delmasâ I will Join lesue â¢with your
Honor upon that Fubject. because for the
nonce I herpen to be rtRbt.
â¢ Mr. Maguireâ Well. It is only once that
you are.
Mr. Mag-sire â Now, If your Honor
y>!ea*e, I aFk the court to check the %en

Let the tornado with its whirling arms seize upon its structure and scatter it to the four winds,
rather than that young matrons shall continue to spend, their time in its gambling- dens from the going
down of the sun until the rising thereof, and amid the fumes of wine and the rank odors of tobacco dis
sipate the hard-earned fortunes of their husbands.
Let it be blotted but until its very ruins shall perish, rather than that it shall continue to be a
haunt from which the young brids, her lips still tremulous with vows just pronounced at the altar, and
wearing upon her brow the white flowers of her hymeneal crown, shall be taken out at midnight to a
place of assignation, to be brought back at morn to dishonor -with hsr polluted body the bed of her un
suspecting husband. Aye, let it perish, and this community will be all the healthier, all the stronger,
all the better for it 0
But, gentlemen, stately &3 that structure is, attractive as are the grounds, the gardens and the
groves which surround it, what is it in comparison with the attractions which this country presents as a
place to invite and welcome the wsary to restP Baron von Schroeder may have destroyed that hotel as a
place of resort, but the hand which clothes your valleys with verdure, which plants the majestic trees on
the slope of your mountains and hangs the clouds upon the unsullied brow of Tamalpais will not be '
stayed in its munificence simply bacauss Baron von Schroeder shall have been expelkd from its borders.
Unfortunate man! I do not wish to speak harshly of him! "I desire to speak in moderation. I will
use no vituperation. His condition is one which must indeed excite the most profound pity of a generous
heart. Young, gifted, a nobleman in his own country, he came to our State to wed one of our own
daughters, that swest Irish girl that all knew as Mamie Donahue. Confiding in his manhood and in the
chivalry which his title implied, she gave into his hands her share of that bountiful fortune which her ,
father, by years of toil and industry, had accumulated. And how has he requited her love? How has
he repaid her confidence? Where is she now? Where are the children with whom she has blcssad his
homeP
Mr. Maguire (interrupting) â They are being educated in Europ?. ,
Â« Mr. Dalmas â Yes, exiled irom the land where they were born, where she was marriedâ exiled
from the home where her father came as a humble pioneer. A California education is not good enough,
it seems, for a Baron's children. They must be sent abroad. Young barons, with the free blood of the
Donahues coursing through their veins. Their condition will be much improved by being sant there.
- WHERE ARE THE FRIENDS WHO CLUSTERED AROUND, HIM IN THE SUNSHINE OF
HIS FACTITIOUS PROSPERITY? WHERE ARE THEY? IN THIS HOUR OF SUPREME TRIAL,
WHEN HIS COUNSEL SAYS THERE IS SOMETHING MORE AT STAKE THAN HIS ' LIFE, DO
THESE FRIENDS .COME FLOCKING AROUND HIM? DO THEY ACCOMPANY HIM BACK AND
FORTH FROM HIS HOME TO POUR THE WORDS OF ' SOLACE OR OF HOPE AND GOOD CHEER
INTO HIS EAR? NOT ONE. ARMED BULLIES AND RUFFIANS MAY ATTEND TO PROTECT HIM
FROM THE VENGEANCE OF OUTRAGED HUSBANDS, BROTHERS AND FATHERSâ FRIENDS
THERE ARE NONE.
The wife who might be here to cheer and comfort him is not. The children who might be here,
to attest at least with their innocent hearts that they loved their father and that he had been good to
them are not here. He stands:
s "Alone, aloneâ all, all alone,
Alone upon a wide, wide sea."
NOW, LET ME GIVE YOU ONE PIECE OF ADVICE, UNFORTUNATE MAN! YOUR CA
REER IN THIS STATE HAS BEEN STREWN WITH WRECKS. YOUR POSITION HERE NEITHER
COMMENDS- ITSELF BY THE PERFORMANCE OF GREAT PUBLIC SERVICES NOR BY, ACHIEVE
MENTS IN ANY WALK OF COMMERCE, INDUSTRY OR PROFESSION. YOU MAY NOT HOPE,
THEREFORE, TO TAKE UP THE BROKEN THREAD 'OF YOUR LIFE AND BY AMENDMENT
ACHIEVE SUCCESS OR EMINENCE IN THIS STATE.
RETURN, THEN, TO YOUR OWN COUNTRY. RETURN TO THAT LAND IN ' WHICH YOUR
TITLE GIVES YOU A STANDING, WHICH THE DISTANT WAVES OF THIS SEA OF SCANDAL
MAY NOT HAVE UNDERMINED OR DESTROYED. Â¦
Prostrate yourself at the feet of that wife whom you h^ve
wronged! Out of the abundance of her great heart ask her
forgiveness !
Resume your rank in that army which your title and position gives youâ an army second to
none but our own. Go forth if you may and fight the battles of your country. Go if you may with.
Waldersee to extend the limits of German cojiqusst and civilization to the outermost boundaries of the
Chinese empire. Go into the laboratories of Helmholtz. Carve out a new reputation and God be with
you- By your future conduct blot out the memory of your past shortcomings. Do not demand from this
jury what they cannot give you, and what would avail you little, a verdict against the evidence and the
law, to rspair your shattered reputation. Their province is justice. They have no function of mercy to
perform. Be the architect of your own new career; and, when vpu shnll hav2 achieved that career, then
standing perhaps a gray-haired man with your children and your grandchildren about you, under the
vaulted roof of some great cathedral built- perhaps by some ancestral Prince, Archbishop or Margravs, Â£
as the -white-robed priest standing at the altar prays God to forgive men their trespasses, you may on
your knees appeal to the mercy of him who told the erring woman to go and sin no more, and from
that mercy hope that he who fell like Magdalen, like her may be forgiven.
known; his reputation here, which may be
called his home. To the extent that that
reputation has been damaged, and no
more, the compensation in this case, if
any. if awarded, must go. But.. I repeat,
no compensation of any kind, no, not one
cent, not nominal damages, can be award
ed by you if in your conscience?, in your
deliberations, you shall determine that
the article as published Is substantially
true. I repeat, the first Inquiry is. Is this
article true in substance? If It is, your
la.bors are ended. The law demands of
you and the court will instruct you that
it Is your duty to return a verdict for the
defendant. .. V.'l /3
"The next incident upon that subject
that I desire to "call your attention to, and
I say It so as to permit my learned friend
and your Honor, If I am not pursuing a
proper course, to correct me. The next
circumstance that I desire to call your at
tention to, so far as the truth of the arti
cle la concerned, Is the fact that we wero
not permitted to show by evidence tha
Palace Hotel incident of the 10th of Octo
ber in which the plaintiff was Involved,
la there any objection?"
Mr. Magrulreâ We raise no objection. . I
shall reply to It.
Mr. Delmae â Yes, sir. Would a man of
spotless reputation ever object to the In
troduction of that testimony? SupposG
one of you gentlemen were -accused of
committing a burglary. That would_^ af
fect your reputation, of course.. Suppose
that tho defendant proposed to prove that
In point of fact at a certain place-ante
ceding- the . particular, occasion-, you . had
committed a burglary in a -house, would
you, If you were | conscious .of your Inno
cence, object. to that. evidence? zlt-.a. man
had been accused of stealing cattle, would i
he claim that the particular charge was
false and that, therefore, his reputation
had been injured and that hte character
as an honest man is without spot or flaw,
and Is worth $250,000. would he obj.ect to
the defendant saying. "I propose to prove
that fifteen days hof ore. T charged- you
with stealing these particular â¢ cattle you
i stole the oattle of yolir neighbor. sÂ« and
Ujo." Would he object to it? Doe3 any
! man who has metal In bis hand which he
knows to be- pure' gold.- -which he pro
poses to sell as pure tfold. object to the
purchasers subjecting the article to .those
chemical tests which will determine its
value, any or all of themâ does he?- If a
â¢ man 'has a horee to "sell which he- war
rants to be squmi," or : represents to be
sound, if he is an honest man does he ob
ject to the purchaser subjecting. the horse
to careful Inspection, or even" bringing it
to the eye of a. surgeon? Isn't that.ob
jection made to an inquiry into conduct
by those Â« who ". know . that that : Inquiry
would be disastrous: to^ their claim? And
can there have been any other motive in
excluding the -testimony of the porter of
the; Palace Hotel, in- excluding '.the testi
mony of ; Mr. Spreckels and ofMr.Ltake
In regard to what had taken place On the
10th of October at' the Palace Hotel, ex
cept t*hat the metal which was offered a3
pure gold would - not stand the test of
chemistry and :that ' the- only ' safety -was
to palm it off under the cloak of silence?
\ "The next, gentlemen, that I desire to
call your attention to, the third circum-'
stance. Is: "Is'lt disputed in'thls case :that
the plaintiff during the' years , 1&98 and "1899
was accustomed to'sit'up In the clubhouse
of the Hotel Rafael. with rao'i and women
companions and drinking to excess until
the late hours or the night? Is that dis
puted? Is that not true? Let mÂ» call
your attention to the testimony of certain
witnesses upon that pcint.
" Bernard Peters was coni.ected with
the clubroom from May to September,
1S98. He testified, that the^Baron was :n
the clubroom from 12 to 4 o'clock in Â«he
niorhing with women, " drinking; tie
women drinking, to use his own language,
often more than they could stand. Is not
this testimony of Bernard Peters corrob
orated? What does Mr. William S. Bal
lard say? He says he was the manager
of the clubhouse In the summer of li&&.
The -Baron i was in the clubhouse with la
dles frequently: late. at night, and they
usually drank four bottles of wine.
"Mr. Carl Schaubye says that the
women often drank too much, 'and on one
occasion one of, them '.was Â¦ intoxicated.
"Mr. Thomas Flaherty says the women
were often Intoxicated., He describes the
sickncss.of one. a young:glrl, past mid
night, who fell fainting. In her chair, pale
and exhausted, and they had to send for
a physician and to take her in by, the side
door of the hotel, and he says that they
had. been drinking from- early In the even
ing. Is, not that; true?
"Heavy and late' drinking therefore Jn
this case : on frequent occasions; by the
Baron . with women." married -and .unmar
ried.-until they had drunk more/than they
couldLstand, and to put it in- the mildest
form , of one of. these witnesses, until ttoey
were frequently 4 drunk, and.; to put Jtiin
thej language; of two others;- until, as an
undisiuted fact, one of them became sick,
having commenced to drink early In the
evening, past -midnight, the doctor had to
LET THAT HOTEL BE FIRED BY THE TORCH OF THE INCENDIARY UNTIL NOTHING
BUT A HEAP OF SMOLDERING ASHES SHALI/ REMAIN, BATHER THAN THAT YOUNG GIRLS
SHALL CONTINUE TO DRAG THEIR WHITE ROBES THROUGH THE MIRE AND SLIME OF ITS
MIDNIGHT ORGIES UNTIL FALLING, OVERCOME BY WINE, THEY SURRENDER THE TREAS
URES OF THEIR PURITY INTO THE ARMS OF MERCILESS DEB-aUCHERE.
But, if this management is to continue in the future what it has been in the past, then, if a ver
dict in favor of the defendant shall ruin ths : business of that hotel and bar its doors against the ingress
of a single reputable guesr, I appeal to you as members of this community, as husbands of honorable
wives, as fathers of virtuous sons and daughters, to welcome those consequences.
Now, gentlemen, certain consequences , have been vaguely shadowed by my learned friend, cal
culated, according to his construction, to follow your rendering a verdict in favor of the defendant, for
that is the verdict we 'ask. Appealing to your interest in the welfars of this city, he' depicts the ruin
of this hotel as a place of public resort that must follow a verdict f or. the defendant. I do not apprehend
that any one of you believes that any such conssquences will follow. I do not doubt that, under p:o_.er nun
agement, it will continue to be in the future what it has been for many years in the past, a place of re
sort for persons seeking" in' the country recreation from their labors in the city. .
"The next proposition then goes to the
question. If there Is no occasion to pun
ish, and .no warrant for punishing Mr.
Spreckels, is there any warrant for com
pensating in this case? And upon that
subject I will divide what little I have
to say under two heads. There is no
compensation possible ll the things that
were published about the plaintiff here
were true; If these things were substan
tially true, If the conduct of Baron von
Schroeder held him up to the eyes of the
world and of the community as a man of
the character delineated in that article,
and you bo believe, and you so find, that
ends your inquiry. Under the laws of th s
country no man can be held civilly liable
for uttering a truth by word of mouth or
publishing it In print, no matter how in
jurions that truth may be to another. The
policy of our law requires that private
and public affairs in tnls free country
Ehall be carried on upon a basis of truth.
And whoever by word or print furthers
the cause of truth is a public benefac
tor, although it may possibly hurt the
feelings or the business of an individual,
the answer being. 'You have no business
to conduct yourself personally or to so
transact your business as that the truth
will injure you or it.'
"The first question is as I have stated,
and the second is: If the article is not
true, though you should find that It be
not true, then what is the value of that
reputation which is claimed to have been
injured? How far has it been injured?
"Taking up the first point, with refer
ence' to the truth of this article, we have
pleaded in our answer, as the law author

"Bear with me while I examine the wit
nesses upon that subject, and briefly re
hearse, for the sake of assisting your
memory, their testimony " upon that
point.
"The question is. Was the conduct of
Baron von Schroeder. as known, as mani
fested at the Hotel Rafael, of such a char
acter that it may be properly designated
to be the conduct of a profligate- man?
"The first witness upon that subject is
Mr. Krancls I-. Perkins. He had teea two
lady guests of the hotel in company with
the Baron and his brother, one of them a
married woman, at Panort's. And it
appeared from his conduct that he. the
Baron, was pretty fresh with women; en
tirely too loving with a lady for a mar
ried man:. his attentions to her a little too
marked for the attentions of a married
man to a married woman in public. The
Daren's reputation, he stated to Mr.
Leake. was very bad in the town of San
Rafael in regard to one subject. His rep
utat!on in regard to women was very bid

regarding the Baron's connection with

next witness."

else there may be in this case, upon which

entirely any question of malice which

only thing that it could call forâ not mere
compensation, but punishment. Let me

to recover the value of th,g reputation

a character that she was taken into the
holt! not by the front door, which is the
nearest to the clubroom. but by a secret
or aide door. Is not that true? Let the
counsel dispute it. What does his clients
say upon that subject? Do they deny the
meeting of the plaintiff and his brother
and other companions, though they were
frequently alone with these women, two
or more, married and unmarried, at the
clubhouse night after night, drinking
champagne, drinking whisky, drinking
beer, drinking ale? Do they deny it? Do
they deny that the drinking continued
often from early in the evening until as
late as 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning? Do
they deny it? Do they deny that one of
the women, a young girl, unmarried, be
came ill there in the very act of drinking,
having commenced the carousal early in
the evening, became sick after midnight,
and a doctor had to be sent for and she
had to be carried secretly into the hotel?
Do they deny it? No. They think that
they have taRen away the whole sin. they
think that ttiey have restored the bloom
of virtuous maidenhood and virtuous ma
tronhood upon the cheeks of these women
companions of the saturnalian carousals
when they draw the line and say they
v.ere not drunk. I will admit, if you
please, that they were not drunk. But
vi hat Is the condition of a woman who
has corr-nienced drinking as early as 8 at
night and continues drinking until 4 in
the morning, keeping that up day after
day until they were known as the Baron's
crowd or as the Baron's party? Had you
a son growing up into manhood would
you have him select a wife from such a
class of women? And if >'ou would not,
is it not because conduct of that kind
meets with your reprehension? And If
you would not. will you not visit your
censure upon the man. one of mature
years, a man of position, a ir; n bearing
a title which I have no doubt is In his
country a badge of honor and of respect,
however worthless it may be in our re
publican institutions: he himself married,
having children? If you would, gentle
men, by your verdict approve of his con
duct in taking these young. matrons and
these young girls to the clubhouse and
spending the hours of nlght>in drinkingâ
is that the course of an honorable or a
moral man?
"I pass to the next point, as to the
gambling. Is that denied? Have either
of these witnesses, the only ones intro
duced upon this question, the Baron anl
his brother, have they denied that they
were in the habit of gambling at the club
house with women? Have they denied
that the gambling parties were in the
habit of commencing early in the evening
and continuing until the hotel manage
ment forced them to put out the lights?
Has that been denied? Carl Schauby;
says that these gambling parties lasted
until 3 or 4 o'clock In the morning. Mr
Bocqueraz, their own witness, says, and I
quote his own language. 'They usually
commenced at S o'clocK In the evening'
'i.K-y were, then, all-night affairs. Did
these gambling affairs create any scan
dal? A lot of men and women playing
a gambling game for money, drinking
wine and whisky and gin and ale for eight
hours, at the dead of nightâ is that con
duct which, if tolerated by the manage
ment of a hotel, is calculated to escape
the prying eyes of attention? Is it cal
culated not to injure the reputation of
that hotel? Is it not conduct which would
drive away any honest woman, which
would keep away any honest family from
there? I leave it to you. Is it possible
that hojiest men can differ upon that
question? ' â¢â¢":=Â¦
"Schaubyc says one night at 3 o'clock,
while they were gambling with a lady hi
the party, half a dozen gentlemen and
one ladyâ after having commenced, prob
ably, as usual, about 8 o'clockâ at 3 o'clock
in tlie morning \Mr. Schaubye, v;ho hail
charge of the place, came in and- told the
Baron that Mrs. Warneid said the lights
must be put out. The lady became in
dignant, would not have it. She was in
toxicated, says Schaubye. Is it unlikely
that she was? Mr. Schaubye says: *I
came again later and told them that Mrs
Warfield insisted upon the lights being
put out, and the. Baron said that he
wished three or four more jack-pots, and
then they would go.' Is that denied? Has
Baron ven Schroeder denied that? Has
his brother denied it? Has either of the
two witnesses who were brought here, for
they were members of that party, denied
that they had played poker all that night
until the management of the hotel or
dered the lights to be put out: and they
came again and the Baron insisted upon
having his play, notwithstanding that.
Does any one deny that?
"Take a third point: The companions of
the Baron, one particular married woman
at that hotel having been commented on
by the witnesses as a source of notorious
scandal. Is that true? Mr. Perkins be
gins by telling you that he had notice
at the Fairfax Villa that the conduct of
the Baron toward a married woman, or
p. couple of them who were there, was not
such aft became his position as a married
man; he wan altogether too loving to

Raymond O'Neil tells you that there was

he had frequently seen the Baron in the
afternoon Issuing from that lady's room.

"To proceed with my argument at the
point where- I left off. I had already mads
some comments on the testimony of Mr.
Edward R. Ross, who say3 that the Ba
ron frequented the clubhouse with a mar
ried woman, to whom he paid marked at
tention?, and that the lights on the porch
were frequently turned out when the
Baron sat there, and that the lady was
sitting there on his lap. - .
Mr. Delmasâ There is one fact which
tht learned counsel seems to have over
looked. I have a^ right to state my posi
tion before you gentlemen. I am not thÂ»
judge. It is sufficient for me to state my
position. His Honor, as to questions of
law. will determine whether my position
is right. As to questions of fact, you will
determine whether I am right or whether
the counsel Is right. And I was saying
in that connection, if your Honor please,
and for the benefit of counsel, that to
state what I meant, more clearly than I
can express it. I will state it In these
words (reading): 'Mental pain or anxiety
tho law cannot value, and does not pre
tend to redress, when the unlawful act
complained of causes that alone, though*
where a material damage occurs, and is
connected with it. it is Impossible that a
Jury in estimating it should altogether
overlook the feelings of the party inter
ested.' And you will find, gentlemen, that
the complaint In this case, signed by my
learned friend and his associate, claims
damages for injury to the reputation, and
to that alone, 'tha't by reason of said
printing and publishing and circulation,*
etc., 'of said false, malicious, scandalous
and defamatory words, the plaintiff was

have to follow the instructions of tha
court.
Mr. Maguireâ I object to that statement
of a proposition of law and say that it
!s incorrect. ~ 'Â¦->.''-Â¦-
"Before proceeding with 'my argument,
gentlemen, one part of niy remarks, which
has been called to my attention, may hav\>
been misunderstood f. y you. as It has been
misunderstood apparently by same, others
who heard it. I stat^i to you that an ac
tion of this kind is brought to recover
damages for an injury to reputation. Tha
defamation of the good name and stand
ing in the community and the injury to
that good name, fame and standing.
which constitutes reputation, is what we
lawyers term the gist of the action. And if
the. Jury find that the plaintiffs reputa
tion was bad. that he had no reputation
to lose, there is an cml to the case. If.
however, the jury find that he had a. rep
utation and that that reputation has been
affected, then another inquiry is institut
ed. And let me state -italn. if he had no
reputation, it makes no difference that the
article may have caused him pain. This
pain that it caused him. If he had no rep
utation to lose, cannot be made the basis
of a recovery- But if he had a reputation
and that reputation has been injuriously
affected, then, beyond question, the. pain
which he suffered as a result of the losa
of his reputation is a proper element of
damage in the case. That is what I in
tended to say. gentlemen, but what I may
not have said clearly."
At this point recess was taken until 1:30
p. m.. at which time the argument was
resumed as follows:
"Mr. Edward R. Koss sava the Baron

the Baron sat there with a lady sitting

"General Warfleld stated to Mr. Leake
and to Mr. Raymond that the Baron had
debauched in the hotel a young woman
who had come there as a virtuous girl
but was susceptible to flattery. Now,
could not Baron von Schroeder have de
nied these things? He did not deny them.
And if we take the facts independent of
these which the learned counsel has so
repeatedly challenged, is it not sufficient
for the purposes .of this case when we
justify this publication to hold up to the
world the true character of this man?
We ask you to accept as facts the undis
puted circumstances which I have re
tailed to you, thirteen in number, begin
ning with the ride to Pastorl's. the drink
ing parties, the gambling parties, the fre
quent visits to married women's rooms,
the order of Mrs. Warfleld to put out the
light, the giving of $3 to Ballard, the wo
man's paying for the wine, the calling- of
this married woman 'dear* In the presence
of the waiter, the drinking of four bot
tles of champagne usually â Is that not
sufficient to give some character to the
conduct of this plaintiff? And if these
things are true, were they not sufficient
to affect the reputation of that hotel and
to' drive away respectable people, fam
ilies, from there? And if they were, gen
tlemen, if the circumstances that I have
detailed, the principal ones of which have
been testified. to by the witnesses that I
have dwelt upon, if they are proved to
your satisfaction to be trueâ and how can
the ride to Pastori's be called In question
when the plaintiff does not deny It? â If
these things are proved to your satisfac*
tion to be true, then I have reached the
second important point of my inquiry In
this case, the alleged libelous article in
this case was trueâ true In substance.
The gist of it is established and the case
is at an end. For as I have already stat
ed to you and as the court will instruct
you, if you find that this article was in
substance true, if you find that It was
substantial, a faithful portrait of the con
duct of the Baron In this hotel and in it's
vicinity during the period covered by the
article, the charge of libel is justified, for
the very first definition of a libel is that
it must be a false publication. If it is
true It is not a libel and the truth Is a
complete and absolute not only justifica
tion but a complete and absolute defense.
CONSEQUENCES
FORESHADOWED
Mr. Delmasâ That is quit,e a correct
statement of the law and one In which I
entirely acquiesce. And let me say in
passing that any interruption which coun
sel may make of my argument Is perfectly
welcome upon the assumption that it is
rhade in compliance with the rules of good
breeding, and when he says I make these
statements knowing them to be false, he
Is violating the rules of proper courtesy,
and Is stating what Is absolutely untrue.
The Courtâ The jury will be Instructed
that the testimony given by gentlemen as
to the information that was given to Mr.
Leake and Mr. Spreckels is to be consid
ered solely by them in determining the
question of express malice â cannot be
taken by them as tending in any degree
to prove the truth of any of the matters
In the alleged libelous article.
Mr. Maguireâ Counsel is making state
ments for which there is no evidence and
which he knows to be false.
cacy of counsel for the law is about as
evident as is his delicacy in hurting the
feelings of these poor defenseless wit
nesses. He did not scruple to do the one,
and if It served his purpose you may con
jecture yourselves whether he would not
at least make an effort to prove the other.-
Now, gentlemen, following that line. Mr.
Perkins did'state, nay. General Warfield
did state, in the presence of Mr. Leake
and of Mr. Raymond, that a young lady
at the hotel had been ruined by the
Baron's machinations and those of his
brother. Did the Bnron deny it? It is
proved as a fact that General Warfleld
said so. Said what? The learned counsel
is very hilarious, and it is gratifying to
see that he is in excellent humor, because
we shall get along faster.
cause they are humble, and because they
have no other crime than poverty, de
nounce them with a vocabulary which
would fit the mouth of a. fishwife or a
common scold? Perjurers? Scoundrels?
Jailbirds? Hobo witnesses? Perjured vil
lains? Men upon whose faces' the very
stamp of crime is Impressed? And so
with the whole vocabulary which my
learned friend has Indulged in, much to
my astonishment and my profound reg'ret.
"Poor Bailey comes in for the most *of
this abuse. He is everything that is vile.
"Were he to approach my friend on the
street he would instinctively clap one
hand upon his watch and the other* upon
his hip pocket to secure his purse and his
money. He tells you that were he to look
in the criminal records at the City Hall
in San Francisco he would be quite sure
to find the name of Bailey there on the
prison record, or his picture in the
rogues' gallery. Hasn't he looked? Why
hasn't he. Bailey's deposition was taken
on the 2Cth of June, six months ago. The
learned counsel was present. He had the
amplest opportunity to cr.oss-examlne him.
Did Bailey say anything in his deposition
different from what he stated on the
stand? No. Ileay no, because if he had
the learned counsel would promptly have
said as to that, as he pointed out in other
things, 'Mr. Bailey, didn't you, in the
deposition given in Colonel Preston's of
fice, in my presence and In his
presence, say bo and so?' Bailey
then, on the 26th of June, told him
in his presence and in his hearing
of the identical circumstance which he
has testified to upon the stand. If true
it was a damaging circumstance. If that
BeenÂ© took place upon that green slope in
that grove of trees the way he describes
It it holds up this man to the scorn and
indignation of every right-minded indi
vidual, nobody can doubt, and" the learned
counsel positively affirms. If Bailey was
the bad character that he says he is; if
he was certain that his picture would be
found in the rogues* gallery, if he had a
criminal record and his name would be
found upon the jail books, why has not it
been found? The. learned counsel, with
the wealthy Baron, his client, by his side,
has had all his wealth or rather his wife's
wealth, what is left of It, at his disposal
in order to make, the investigation, and
he has not found one word against poor
Bailey. He is not a criminal. His name
Is not on the prison books. His picture
is not In the rogues' gallery. His past
life has not been such as the counsel
would have yom believe. He Is absolutely
proof In his integrity against all things. 1
except oneâ a denunciation which is not
generous, because it cannot be answered
by him. It is not a very noble .undertak
ing, gentlemen, because a man is com
pelled, either by a sense of justice or by
the process of the law to go into a court
of Justice and give his testimony. It is
not a proof of very- great generosity to
abuse him with all the vile epithets of
the Billingsgate calendar when he I3 ab
solutely powerless to defend himself, and
when, if he were in^the courtroom and
should rise to his feet to make his feeble
protest against it he would at once be
ordered by the Sheriff to sit down.
"I say that the learned counsel In his
denunciation of these witnesses, in my
humble judgment, has carried things too
far.
"I desire to call your attention to an
other thing. The testimony of Mr. Jewell,
If true, was of itself a complete
Justification of this alleged libel. Was
it not? "Would you not say that
that single thing, if proven to your
satisfaction, would Justify the pub
lication of this article in the newspa
per, would Justify General "Warfleld in
giving up the lease? Mr. Jewell had to be
got out of the way in some way. And
what Is the way? Jewell is denounced as
a base, perjurer; as a perjured scoundrel,
as a man without honor and without rep
utation. And in' order to prove that Jew
ell, who has lived in this community, I
think he says twenty-nine or thirty years,
in order to prove that his reputation in
this community is bad, in order wantonly
to strike him down and besmirch him in
the defense of this plaintiff here, two wit
nesses are brought forward out of th's
whole community' -where Jewell must
have, commenced to live when he was
comparatively a young man, if not a boy,
the dragnet of the Baron is extended over
this community and two fish are caught.
They are of the same kind, and ' their
name Is Murray.
"Gentlemen, there is an old proverb
which time proves true, 'Like father, like
son." Do you remember the elder Mur
ray? An old man ready, standing upon
the brink of the grave to go to that
judge who makes no errors in his judg
ment, and account for his life. And that
man, with uplifted hand, knowing the
solemnity of this occasion, and the grav- i
lty of the duty which he is. called upon to
perform, asked a simple question whether
he is tho father of the preceding witness
who had sworn that, he was his son, says,
with a leer and a grin, 'I suppose so, but
you know a man can never, be sure of
those things.' He assail, he Impeach the
reputation of any living human being,
however degraded? He? The man who
almost within the hearing of his gray
haired wife, upon this very stand assailed
her reputation by proclaiming that he was
not certain that he was the. father of her
child? Will you take his voucher? A
man whoso feelings, whose senses of del
icacy or of honesty are of that kind, will
you take his voucher to impeach Mr.
Jewell, and will you take that, when out
of this whole community, they alone are
produced to prove m. fact which, to be
valuable at all, must be a fact of general
notoriety, for It is general reputation that
they testify to when they confess that
they were that day and at the very hour
at which they testified in the employ of
the plaintiff In this case, and are driving
him backward and forward and his co
horts and his armed satellites back and
forth from this court room? It is the
desperation, the last act of a despairing
cause, and I submit to your judgment the
act of Impeachment of Mr. Jev.fll was
perfectly unwarranted, perfectly unjusti
fied, it was wanton, cruel, vindictive, and
it was the despair of the writhing snake
that stings itself and .kills Itself with its
own venom.
"Gentlemen, !et me rehearse the things
in this case which are undisputed. If I
make any error as to any one of them
the learned counsel may rest assured that
he will afford me neither inconvenience
nor displeasure by setting me right, and
with that announcement I will read to you
the things which Baron J. H. von
Schroeder does not deny.
"He does not deny the riile out to Pas
tori's, which Mr. Jewell has described. He
does not deny leaving the hotel at the
hour stated, about 10:30. He does not
deny remaining behind with the bride.
He dogs not deny returning at 3 or 3:30
in the morning. He does not deny their
entering the hotel by a side door. All
that he and all that his brother deny in

The Courtâ That stands in the same po

Mr. Delmas â I will make myself clear,

ARGUMENT FOR
THE PLAINTIFF
"Now, let me give you one piece of ad
vice, unfortunate man! Your career in
this State has been strewn with wrecks.
Your position here neither commends It
self by the performance of great public
services, nor by achievements in any
walk of commerce, industry or profession.
You may not hope, therefore, to take up
the broken thread of your life and by
amendment achieve success or eminence
in this State. Return, then, to your own
country. Return to that land in which
yo\ir title gives you a standing, which the
distant waves of this sea of scandal may
not have undermined or destroyed. Pros
trate yourself' at the feet of that wif
whom you have wronged. Out of the
abundance of her great heart ask her for
giveness. Resume your rank In thut
army which your title and position gives
youâ an army second to none but our
own. Go forth if you may and fight the
battles of your country. Go, If you may,
with Waldersee to extend the limits of
German conquest and civilization to the
outermost boundaries of the Chinese em
pire. Go into the laboratories of Helm
holtz. Carve out a new reputation, and
God be with you. By your future conduct
blot out the memory of your past short
comings. Do not demand from this jury
what they cannot . give - you, and what
would avail you little, a verdict against
the evidence and the law. to repair your
shattered reputation. Their province is
justice. They have no function of mercy
to perform. Be the architect of your own
new career; and, when you shall have
achieved that career, then standing per
haps a gray-haired man with your chil
dÂ»en and your grandchildren about you
under the vaulted roof of some great
cathedral built perhaps by some ancestral
prince, archbishop or margrave, as the
white-robed priest standing at the altar
prays God to forgive men their trespasses
you may on your knees appeal to the
n>ercy of him who told tho erring woman
to go and sin no more, and from that
mercy hope that he who fell like Magda
len, like her may be forgiven."
Alone, aloneâ all, all alone.
Alone upon a wide, wide sea.
Mr. Delmas â The wife who might be
here to cheer and comfort him. Is not.
The children who might be .here to attest
at least with their Innocent hearts that
they loved their father and that he had
been good to them are not here. He
stands
Mr. Delmasâ I look, gentlemen, to the
place where the noble Baron's friend3 sit.
Mr. Maguire (Interrupting) â Where are
Spreckels' friends?
The Courtâ Mr. Maguire, you have the
closing argument.
Mr. Magulre (interrupting)â I submit
there is no such evidence as the gentle
man is retailing here.
The Courtâ Mr. Delmas simply said
"may."
Mr. Delmasâ Yes, exiled from the land
where they were born, where she was
marriedâ exiled from the home where her
father came as a humble pioneer. A Cali
fornia education is not good enough. It
seems, for a Baron's children. They must
be sent abroad. Young barons . with the
free blood of the Donahues coursing
through their veins! Their condition will
be much Improved by being sent there.
Where are the friends who clustered
around him in the sunshine of his fic
titious prosperity? Where are they? In
this hour of supreme trial, when hi3 coun
sel says thera io something more at stake
than his life, do these friends come flock
ing around him? Do they accompany
him back and forth from his home to
pour the words of solace or of hope and
good cheer into his ear? Not one.
Armed bullies and ruffians may attend to
protect him from the vengeance of out
raged husbands, brothers and fathers
friends there are none.
"Unfortunate man! I do not wish to
speak harshly of him! I desire to speak
In moderation. I will use no vituperation.
His condition is one which must Indeed
excite the most profound pity of a gener
ous heart. Ynune:, gifted, a nobleman In
his own country, he came to our State to
wed one of our own daughters, that sweet
Irish girl that all knew as Mamie Dona
hue. Confiding in his manhood and In the
chivalry whlsh his title Implied, she con
fided into his hands her share of that
bountiful fortune which her father, by
years of toil and Industry, had accumu
lated. And hew has he requited her love?
How has he repaid her confidence? Where
is she now? Where are the children with
whom she has blessed his home?"
Mr. Magulre (interrupting)â They are
being educated in Europe.
"But, gentlemen, stately a3 that struc
ture Is, attractive as are the grounds, the
pardens and the groves which surround
it, what is it in comparison with the at
tractions which this country presents as
a place to Invite and welcome the weary
to rest. Baron von Schroeder may have
destroyed that hotel as a place of resort,
but the hand which clothes your valleys
with verdure, which plants the majestic
trees on the'slope of your mountains and
hangs the clouds upon the unsullied brow
of Tamalpais will not be stayed In its
munificence simply because Baron von
Schroeder shall have been expelled from
its borders.
continue to drag their white robes
through the mire and slime of its mid
night orgies until falling, overcome by
wine, they surrender the treasures of
their purity Into the arms of merciless
debauchers. Let the tornado with its
whirling arms seize upon its structure and
scatter it to the four winds rather than
that young matrons shall continue to
spend their time in Its gambling dens
from the going down of the sun until the
rising thereof, and amid the fumes of wine
and the rank odors of tobacco dissipate
the hard-earned fortunes of their hus
bands. Let it be blotted out until its very
ruins shall perish rather than that it shall
continue to be a haunt from which the
young bride, her lips still tremulous with
vows just pronounced at the altar, and
wearing upon her brow the white flowers
of her hymenial crown, shall be taken out
at midnight to a place of assignation, to
be brought back at morn to dishonor with
her polluted body the bed of her unsus
pecting husband. Aye, let It perish, and
this community will be all the healthier,
all the stronger, all the better for it.
Judge Angellotti began his cbarya tfl
the Jury at 4:43 and concluded it at 5:21
o'clock. The Jury retired at 5:23 and at
8:30 o'clock It returned with It3 verdict.
"The liberty of the press, ye3; tha li
cense of the press, no. The liberty of tha
press I defend; the license" which inquires
into private affairs and attacks individ
uals for the sake of sensation Is an In
famous misuse of the power of the pres3
and ought to be stamped out by putting
the stamp of your disapproval upon this
Instance of It. No matter what your
opinion of drinking wine or playing: cards
in the clubhouse of a summer hotel, you
are not here to pass upon those customs
or upon peculiar German customs. You
are here to determine Â¦whether or not they
have proved that infamous libel.
"We submit that the liberty of the press
will best be served by setting up re
straints and putting a limit to the license
of the press. A verdict In favor ot the
plaintiff expressing your disapproval of
malicious and wanton attacks upon indi
viduals by metropolitan newspapers will
fortify the real liberty of the press, and
we ask of you such a verdict."
"Counsel speaks of drunkenness, gam
bling and debauchery In the hotel, and
there Is no proof of any of these- things
in the evidence. The wine-drlnkingr and
card-playing Incidents are magnified by
these waiters Into revelry and vlciousness.
These little Incidents occur at every sum
mer hotel in the country. If Mr. Spreck
els' hotel at Coronado Is as respectably
conducted as the Hotel Rafael has been
we certainly can have- no cause for com
plaint against it.
"The good motives of Mr. Spreckels are
of no consequences in this case unless his
good motives prompt good acts and secure
good consequences. Counsel goes to the
extent of saying that plaintiff wronged
his wife. That. I presume. Is based on
the testimony of Ballard. That plaintiff
gave Ballard five dollars we do not deny,
but It was not for any espionage. I have
no doubt that he gave many of those fel
lows five dollars. 'Will you do ma a fa
vor* ? that was tho manner of his speaWng
to the waiters at tho hotel.
"John Bailey? I did denounce h!m> as
the man of Iniquity of the whole caaaâ *
man who would hire cut to blacken an
other's character. He told a story utter
ly unbelievable, either tha invention of
the perjurer himself or of a suborner of
perjury. I denounced him for his failure
of memory of the tlmo of the scene- ha
described, tho shield of a perjurer.
"I denounced Mr. Jewell's testimony be
cause I believed It to be untrue. And let
me say that I consider that the attack
of counsel this morning upon Mr. Murray
was a brutal outrace. They had not a
witness whom they would dare to> com
pare with that honorable old man.
"They assert that the article was true
and they come In here now with ths
scaliest testimony that was ever present
ed. Both counsel comment upon my de
nunciations of their witnesses. I de
nounced most of the witnesses, not in
general terms, but by showing the char
acter of the testimony of each. If there
has been more denunciation than usual
it is because more indefensible perjurers
have been introduced in this case than
In any within my knowledge. Perjurers
whose testimony has been cooked, up
since the tiling ot this suit to establish a
defense, aye, and to hand down a. heritage
of shame to the children of the friend or
Mr. Delmas' early days."
Mr. Magulre referred to "Witnesses
Peters, Mos3, Ballard, Schaubye and Jew
ell and characterized their testimony as
perjury. Continuing he said:
"They ask, "What did Leake do after bo
read the letter of General Warfleld in tnÂ«
Bulletin in denial? I'll tell yon what ha
did. He published that editorial In glori
fication of the libel he had published the
day before. MalicÂ© must be proved, they
say. Malice is presumed In libel until it3
absence la proved. And after the denial
over Warfleld's signature they published
that branding editorial in further attempt
to Injure the plaintiff and drive himâ
where? Mr. Delmas ha.> told you.
Magnlre began a retort, but Judge An
gellotti interrupted, saying: "I do not de
sire any further conversation between
counsel. If there are objections counsel
will address themselves to the court."
"They ask why the plaintiff did not go
to see Mr. Spreckels. Shall the man
whom, the assassin stabs in the back
ask for explanations? But he did go to
see Mr. Spreckels." Â»*
"That Is not in evidence." said Mr. Del
mas.
"I have only stated It as true," said Ma
gulre.
"And I have an equal right to say that
It is not true," responded Delmas.
"They have- retailed a great many tales
that were in the libel and a rreat many
that were not In It. and say that War-
Held told them so. miigllnff evidence ct
the latter as proof of the truth of the
article. Did Warfleld say he said tho3is
things? Did The Call make any Investiga
tion? They did not interview a single nuui
who claimed to have a personal knowl
edge of the alleged misconduct. Either
they did not care a copper or they were
actuated by malice. They may have
thought the plaintiff would not care to
bring a suit for libel. He is the one man
In a thousand to do it. He had the cour
age, the manhood, the respect for Justice
to do it.
"Very well: I shall not transgress, even
by following the example of opposing
counsel," said Magnire. HÂ© proceeded:
"In answering, I must proceed by tak
ing up the points made by the counsel for
defendant. He dwells upon our objection
to the Introduction of testimony as to tho
Palace Hotel episode. It is my province
as counsel to object to the Introduction of
irrelevant' and immaterial evidence,
against the protest of my client."
Mr. Delmas objected to the statement.
"against the protest of my client." as not
being a part of the evidence.
"It may not be in (ho evidence, but it
la true." answered Maguire.
"We have no other voucher than your
word," retorted Delrnas.
"The position of Mr. Delmas 13 correct,**
said Judge Angellotti.
"An article such as the one alleged tÂ»
be llbelous Is presumed to be false, to
be malicious, to be Injurious, and the ad
missions in the defendant's answer wera

"What is the reply to all this, gentle
men? What is the reply when the sub
stantial, substantive facts of all these
transactions are admitted, and the bal
ance is proven by more than half a dozen
witnesses? A very extraordinary course
has been pursued by the counsel on the
other side, and 1 must say that no one
admires his abilities and his character
mere than I do. Xo man has been a
Â¦warmer friend and espouser of his cause

must say that the conduct of the learned
counsel in dealing with these witnesses
has appeared to me to be absolutely cruel,
unwarranted and unjustifiable.
"Now, she may have been sober, gen
tlemen, when she came back; she may
not have reached that point of Inebriation
which Baron von Schroeder, accustomed
to these nightly carousals, may choose in
the delicacy of his knightly mind to call
drunk when applied to a lady, but do you
give the sanction of your Judgment to
conduct of this kind? Is that conduct be
coming the proprietor of that hotel? Is
that conduct becoming a man whose rep
utation for chastity, whose reputation for
continence Is made of such superfine stuff
that it Is worth a quarter of a million if
the slightest taint is breathed upon it?
Do men of that kind of reputation go to
Pastorl's at 11 o'clock at night and stay
there until 3 o'clock In the morning with
other men's wives? Do they? Is com
ment necessary upon this subject, gentle
men? Is It necessary for me to make this
case worse than it Is? Is It necessary for
me to harrow up anybody's feelings more
than the discharge of my strict duty re
quires, to suppest merely to you the out
lines of the picture and leave It to your
own good sense and good Judgment to fill
In the balance?
"Mr. Jewell tells you that this unfortu
nate bride of but yesterday was in such
a drunken condition that she had to be
carried from her cart into the hotel. Is
not that Irua, gentlemen? Does Baron
von Schroeder deny one single circum
stance of this episode, one single fact?
Does his brother deny it? Is it true that
he was in the habit of ordering rigs from
that stable? lie does not deny it. It is
true that It was known that these rigs
were ordered for a group that was known
as the Baron's party? He does not deny
it. Is it true that at this time, about
half-past ten that night he ordered a car
riage from there and ordered It to go to a
place where he and his party could get
into It secretly and unseen? He does not
deny it. la it true that they got into that
carri-ige, the bride and her husband, and
this other lady and himself? He does not
deny It. Is it true that the lady (the
bride) said, 'Tell them to follow us to Fair
fax." and that he said, 'They will find us
at Pastori's'? He does not deny It. Is It
true that they went to Pastorl's? He does
not deny it. ' Is it true that the wagon re
turned at 1 o'clock at night with the hus
band and the other woman, and that he.
Baron von Schroeder, and that man's wife
remained behind? Is that true? He does
not deny it. Is it true that they did not
come back until the sister. In the agony of
her mind, went after them and compelled
them to come back? He does not deny it.
Is it true that they reached the hotel at
3 o'clock in the morning, coming separate
ways, leaving the bride in company with
her sister, and the man coming sneaking
along with his brother? He does not deny
It. Is Is true that they entered the hotel
by a secret door, that is, not by the pub
lic and ordinary entrance? He does not
deny it. Is it true that they drank and
drank and .drank all that night? What
did they go to Pastori's for? And what
else did they do there? He does not deny
It. The only thing he does deny, drawing
these fine distinctions which this fine and
exquisite moral sense of his suggests to
his learned counsel here, 'Why simply say
that it Is true that we took this bride
from her husband, say that it is true
that we were with her at Pastorl's; say
that it Is true that we remained until the
agonized sister came, there and dragged
us away â say that all that is true; simply
deny that the woman was drunk; confesB
everything else.'
"Do I need to dwell upon that, gentle
men? Is it necessary that we should put
on the colors In this thing, or Is it simply
sufficient to suggest, within the bounds
of decency, what every reasonable man is
at least authorized rationally to conjec
ture? In her distress. In her horror. In
her consternation, this poor girl gets a
"F cart from the stable and starts in
the darkness of the night, after 1 o'clock,
In pursuit of this absent couple.. And 6he
finds them. Finds them where? We were
not allowed to tell. Finds them doing
what? We were not allowed to tell. Do
we need any evidence to conjecture? But
Ri 3 or 3:30 In the morning that unfortu
nate bride, whose husband had returned
to the hotel In such a condition as you
can imagine, ot 1 o'clock finally returns
in company with her Flster, and the two
titled gentlemen in the rig return, and
they part so as to enter the hotel by two
separate side doors, or at two different
rig, and that husband's wife and Baron
von Schroeder absent. They had remained
behind. The husband was taken out of
this rig, got Into the hotel by a side door,
and 'doubtless was put to rest In some
way. Upon the scene came the sister of
this bride, and you may Imagine In what
condition of mind she was when she found
that her sister at dead of night was miss
ing from that party which returned to the
hotel, and was missing under the singular
circumstance that Baron von Schroeder,
who had started with her, was missing
also.

A VANISHED CAPITA!*
Historic Town in Illinois Entirely
Swept Away J>y the Mississippi.
One hundred. years before Illinois be
came a Territory and 111 years before it
became a State there was a town at Kas
kaskia. Fifty years before there was a
white settlement at St. Louis or any mili
tary post at Pittsburg. and ninety-six
years before the foundations were laid
for Fort Dearborn at Chicago, Kaskaskia
was a thriving villlage.
As early as 1710 there were in the town
three mills for grinding corn. As early as
1765 the town contained sixty-five families
of- whites. In 1771, .five years before -the
Revolutionary war, it contained eighty
houses and had a population of oOO whites
and 500 negroes. In 1809 it was made the
capital of Illinois Territory. It was the
capital of the State /rom 1318 until 1821
and was the seat of Randolph County un
til 1Â«47
The first brick house built west of Pitts
burg was constructed in*Kaskaskia. For
over half a century Kaskaakia was the
metropolis of the Upper Mississippi \ al
ley and was the focus of commerce in the
Northwest Territory.
On Thursday the last vestige qf this his
toric settlement was swept away by the
Mississippi River.; The work of destruc
tion that began with the great. flood of
1844 was completed, and the home of the
earlv Illinois Governorsâ the first State
capitalâ cease.d to - exist. Its -destruction
was complete. . Not a stone was left to
mark. the place. '"Â¦*
Chicago, that was built in a swamp, is
the second city in America.' New Orleans,
located in what was believed an unsafe
and unhealthy district, is the commercial
metropolis of thÂ© : Southwest. But Kas
kaskia, which was set on a spot chosen
from the boundless . variety, of the virgin
West, is merely a memory. â Chicago Inter

tinguished French Naturalist.
Such Is the Belief of M. Ferel, a Dis-
ttas vt r.ATtTi AUTS TALK.
Sir John Lubbock, as well as many
other scientists, has of course studied the
cnt, but it has been given to a French
man, a M. FereL to make a. discovery as
regards ants that proves them to be pos
sessed of an Intelligence fax greater than
has been hitherto supposed. And this dis
covery is nothing more or less than that
a:.'..- are cap&ble of producing sounds In -
teiligible to their fellows, and even au
dible to our ears â in other words, that
they converse with one another.
The way M. Ferel proved this was as
follows:
He made a glass funnel, one end smaller
Â¦than the other, which he placed, the Email
end downward. In the center of a square
of plain glass come six inches wide, fit
ting closely enough to pre\-ent the llttlÂ©
Insects from crawnng out underneath. He
the ctook a number of ants in a bunch
ebout the eize of an ordinary horse chest
nut, freÂ» from any foreign eubstance,
and, lifting up the funnel, dropped the
cluster of Insects inside. While the ants
â¢wer etlll In a state of bewilderment, and
before any of them could reach the edge
of the g-iass, the experimenter covered it
â¢with another square, similar to the one
tlr&ady in use, which had been surround
ed a short distance from Its edge by a rim
of putty.
This effectually confined the little In
fects and prevented their being crushed.
The two plates of glass were then pressei
together to within, approximately, the
thickr.ftss of an ants body, but clo^ser on
one side than on the other so as to hnld
tome fast and incapable of moving, while
others could move about in their narrow
prison where they liked. On applying this
dox o* anls to the ear, as though It had
b*en a watch, M. Ferel was astonished to
hear a regular ar.d continuous buzzing
noise, BOinewhat similar to the sound
made by water when boiling !n an open
vessel, though rometlrnes a higher note
â¢would be struck by one or another of the
ar.ts.
Further etufiy of the box of prisoners
revealed many interesting facts. The free
ents wtre seen to advance to the sides
of the ores that could not more and to
Â«iiideÂ«.vor with all their strength to release
tbe prisoners. It vras then that the sounds
xnadÂ© by the ants became louder and more
Etrlnfent. It was evident that these
Founds conveyed some meaning-; for a pal
jiai>le difference was to bo found in the
minute utterances, -which must have been
intelligible to the tinv creatures.
Then came the problem. How was the
eound made? M. Fcrei proceeded to at
once make minute investigations, and sub
mitted live ants to the scrutiny of a very
powerful microscope. Here, again, an In
teresting discovery was fn store for the
investigator. The sides of the little in
rects were found to be In one particular
piace rough and scaly, resemblingâ
though, of course, on a tiny scale â the
teeth of a Eaw. It was by rubbing this
that the ant made the sound that had re
warded the scientist's research.
M F>rel then took a couple of ants and
confined them In the glass box already
c<!scr!bed, imprisoning the one and giving
the other liberty to move. The ant that
} ad free use of his limbs became at once
'"?ense^y excited. It rushed about, mak
l' : sr what must have beenâ taking Into con
federation the comparative s:ze of a man
tiid an antâ a terrible noise. The modu-

BASEBALL AVERAGES
FOR ENTIRE SEASON
The averages of the players and teams of the California Baseball League for
the entire season of 1S00 have been prepared by J. W. Stapleton, official scorer.
'-Â¦Â¦ The surprise in the listing Is the position that Krug occupies In the batting,
base-running and base-stealing column. He heads the list practically, for Pace
has not played in the league for several months.
The San Francisco team shews up In better form with the .stick than in the
field. Stockton is the premier fielding team. Pitchers not appearing In the box
for more than fifteen games were not averaged. The averages tell their own story
and are as follows ;

Frank Hcndcnon, the Kr(ereeÂ«
Joseph Kelly, HI* Opponent, and
PHILADELPHIA. Â£>ee. 2X â FranX
Barr, aged 13 years, died latÂ© to-night la
a hospital here, following a boxing con
test at the Philadelphia Athletic Club.
Joseph Kelly, who was Barr's opponent,
and Frank Henderson, the referee, werÂ»
arrested. For the past few days a tourn
ament between local amateurs ha3 beea
In progress at the club.
On Thursday night Barr was knocked
out by a boxer, who was afterward dis
qualified on the ground of professional
ism.
This allowed Barr to enter to-nighfs
finals. He boxed four rounds with Kid
White and was awarded the decision. Ha
then met Kelly. The first round was fast,
and Kelly sent Barr to the floor. Hen
derson, under the amateur rules, stopped
the round. Barr came up for the second
round, and Kelly so fax outclassed him
that the fight was stopped. Barr stag
gered as he was leaving the- rlnar and it
was decided to send him to a hospital.
Here It v/as found he had a fractured
ekull and death followed soon after.
Frank Barr Receives Blow
Which Causes His
Death.
BOXING BOUT
ENDS FATALLY
"With the hares showing a disposition to
slacken up a bit on the extraordinary and
unusual speed which has characterized
the winter stakes, and considering
the list of evenly matched hounds that
will compete In the finals, the card for to
day certainly has a very open appearance.
In yesterday's event the form players were
successful In picking winners In all but
fifteen of the sixty-four courses in the
run-down, the Bhort ends averaging at a
little better than 2 to X.
Figuring on probable winners of the big
event Wedgewood, Floodgate and Rocker
look to be the strongest candidates on
the top of the card, with the first named
as choice. On the second half Bad Boy,
Anchor and The Grafter are fancied, with
Bad Boy the most likely to fulfill pre
dections.
For Glory, Mose, Brutus and Forest
King have many followers who figure
them as dangerous factors and good out
side possibilities. Whim and Representa
tive, recent importations, had their ttrst
stake work yesterday, but neither could
score a win. While both showed heavy
and out of condition, neither seemed to
have %he foot. When once on the hare.
Whim did a little good work, but her ken
nel mate had no chance against Brutus.
In the run up the new ones were slow.
The general opinion of leashmen who
have looked the dogs up is that they will
not figure In our stakes of class.
For. Glory showed old-time dash, led
Agamemnon four lengths and scored well
on a good hare.
Herschel's Pride returned to the sport
after a lay-off and won his first course,
beating Psyche pointless. He closed the
run with a clever running pick-up. Har
lean Gladys was forced to go three times
to the slips before she could beat Rural
Artist and then by a .single point. Artist
had the foot in the first and second, while
Gladys outworked in the last, showing the
stamina which is characteristic of the St.
Lawrence get. Floodgate just led Fine
Fire to the hare in a long- slip, but after
that had all the foot. Â»
Mose beat Chicago Boy after an unde
cided, and In both run-ups seemed to show
stronger than heretofore.
Beside those mentioned the winners In
the second round look to be Golden Gar
ter, Rona. Faithful Lad, Harlean Gladys,
Spiteful, Tom Hurllek, Mose, Castaway,
Golden Russet, Little Sister, Liberator,
Rocker, St. Michael. Silver Cloud. Lady
Claire. Randow Aim, Iowa Boy, Warship,

FOUR umpires and three scorers
were used up in the charity game
played at Recreation grounds
yesterday afternoon between
nines representing the commis
sion merchants and the Produce Ex
change. The merchants won by a score of
18 to 16. The struggle was a fearful one,
full of fire, fury and recalcitrant demon
strations, but when the end cameâ happy
endâ they all shook hands and said: "We
will do the same thing next year."
Charity was- hit in the eye with a Na
tional League ball on account, of the foul-
Ing propensities of the players, who did
their protracted turn on the diamond in
most skill-less manner. The story of the
game is the story of a' single ball which
cost Emll E. -Kahn, the '"angel ," Just
$12 25. That is why charity suffered.
In their ignorance of Recreation Park
conditions, -the Producers and " the Com
missioners came equipped with number
less bats, masks, gloves and all the appur
tenances of a baseball game, excepting
the most necessary baseballs. At last a
ball was obtained and the game begun.
A minute later tho ball leaped ' over the

Kahn fifty cents for. redemption. . Soon
after this the ball went over the fence
again, and once : more the small boy
reaped hla rodemptlonal reward. Kahn
wired his agent to dispose of some oil
stock, and baseballs were listed two or
three points higher. â¢â¢. ; Â¦
When the frame was over Kahn's money
was gone,; every -boy In the neighborhood
of .the grounds was buying Christmas
presents. ; and the few spectators had to
be told that the game was. finished. :.
Under Kahn's clever manipulation the
price of a dollar baseball was advanced
several hundred polnta In- two hours. The
small boy retriever on the outside of the
grounds was the recipient of all the
Christmas charity, depending Â¦ upon the
game between the Produce Exchange and
commission merchants nines.

ted you to see the fulfillment of the labor
begrun fifty years ago. Not all who stood
at the cradle of Emanu-El are here to re
joice in this festival, for many of them
have fallen by the wayside. A small num
ber of the founders of the congregation
still live, the great majority have paid
the debt of nature. But they live In and
through this noble work which shall pro
claim for all time that they did not labor
in vain. Stirred by their " example, the
young and strong now In your midst are
keeping up the noble Â¦work. "When thÂ© old
tollers grow weary, they can resign the
labor with confidence, for they know that
the young and strong will carry on the
toll. They have passed away with a smile
of happy "contentment and may they reet
In peace. May God bless all the nobls
men and women who have carried on the
heritage of the founders of Emanu-El.
To me has been assigned the beautiful
task of ministering: at this altar, a task
of which a genius might well feel proud."
Rabbi Hecht then traced the history of
Judaism, how it had gone through vari
ous stages until it stood to-day on the
broad, plane of reform.
"It were Indeed strange," said the rabbi.
"If religion did not make ready to ad
vance when the political and social world
was preparing for improvement. The
history of. Israel is the history of thÂ»
world, and on a smaller scale the history
of Emanu-El 13 the history of Israel.
From a strict orthodoxy this congregation
has gone through a period of evolution
until to-day It If allied with science and
humanitv. Modern Judaism, has re
kindled the enthusiasm In the hearts or
the fons and daughters of Israel; moG'
ern Judaism is the Elijah which has re
vived the dying belief. The mission of
modern Judaism Is not yet ended. It haÂ»
to establish harmony between faith and
knowledpe: between God and man; be
tween the past and tho future and be
tween dogma and reform. Ours Is to
make Judaism the religion of the future.
The new century will see better things
in religion. I do not plead for a new reÂ»
ligion. but for a better understanding ot
the true worth of religion. I want to de
clare war on hypocrisy In the name of re
ligion., war on self, war on selfishness and
on vanity. I plead to declare war on that
cringing which undermines manhood and
dwarfs dignity."
Tho eloquent speaker closed his address
with an invocation to God to bless tho
congregation, and the services ended with
the benediction pronounced by Rabbi
Vooiranger.
I The services to-day will begin at 2 p. m.
promptly.

The average length of a career In Con

every Congress about one-third of thÂ»
members of the House are new â¢ to the
business. It Is a rare thing for a.mem
ber to make any sort of a mark In legis
lation before he has been In tha House
at least two full terms, and those who
have forced themselves above the surface
before the dose of a 1 single term can al
most be counted . on tho fingers of one
hand. The ordinary Congressman comes
and goes and leaves no trace behind him,
except on the salary vouchers. The man
who stays in the House fox more than
two terms has a fair chance of wielding
a little Influence. He gets his name Into
the Congressional Record once in a while;
he Is recognized by the Speaker occasion

WONDERFUL! WONDERFUL! WONDER-
FUL!
Have you seen the woman In white? San
Francisco has been visited by many medium*
and palmists but never by one like the
woman in white, "The Famous QUAKER
MEDIUM."
There are only three things In life
Health. Wealth and Love.
She will tell you how to get all three, and
teach you how to keep them. This wonder-
ful woman has accomplished more for her
patror.H through mind vibration, or mental
telegraphy, than any ether medium on earth.
This great t-ecret of mind vibration is
-worth thousands of dollars to professional
' and business men. to wives and lovers, as
by this means you can bring back to you
the absentâ even though the ocean rolls be-
tween.
She will also teach you how to draw about
you the Influences of invisible Intelligences
who people space and who are permitted to
aid Buttering humanity.
Phe Is the only known medium who, through
her spirit guide, has ever Riven prescriptions
that have been printed in medical Journals.
Ministers liave consulted her on the inter-
pretation of the Bible, doctors hsve sent their
patients to her after they have exhausted
every remedy known to the profession.
Lawyers find her advice invaluable, for if
followed ehe will guarantee that the Judge
and Jury will decide not one case In your
favor, but every case.
Knowing what month you were born, ehe
will tell what is attracted to you, through
the Planets and vibrations of the air, oil
or mineral.
Ebe la no new beginner, but a woman being
born with a eift given to few on earth, has
by years of study and experimenting learned
to handle the unseen forces to your advant-
age as easily as you handle the most ordinary
business In life.
fhe is world-renowned for her good works.

COPPERâ Montezuma copperâ is quite the rage.
Some hundreds of people have Invested In It
during the past month. Mr. E. V. Cowell,
a well-known mlnlnjf man of Mexico, has
15.000 shares; he will not sell them. Dr. H.
D. Livingstone of Santa Maria, CaL, Is the
owner of 15.000 shares that he does not care
to part with. The Vulcan Smelting and Re-
fining Company of San Francisco has 6000
shares, and Is bargaining for more. Two
well-known employes -of the Mountain Cop-
per Company of Keswick, Shasta County, hold
M00 shares each, and wish they could af-
ford to buy more while the price Is low
(they know the value of a good copper stock).
Many others, equally shrewd, hold from 1000
to Â£000 shares each, and are adding to their
holdings from month to month, cheerfully
paying the advanced price necessary to se-
cure the stock. It is good etock, and he who
falls to become the owner of a goodly block
at the "ground floor" price works himself
an Injustice. The Montezuma Mining Com-
pany has 18 fine copper properties la Wash-
ington. It is a big, strong, safe company,
and under the laws of Washington its stock
Is non-assessable. % The price is lowâ & cents
per share cash, or 6 cents on Installments.

How the Phrase Is Said to Have
St. Lawrence became the patron saint of
the lazy and indolent because when, under
the fifth persecution of Valerian, he was
tortured to death for his unswerving ad
herence to the new religion . by being
broiled alive on an enormous gridiron, he
mocked his tormentors by saying, "It is
now roasted; turn me and eat." (S. Am
bros., "De Offlciis," 1. 41, 11. 28; S. Aug.,
Serm. 103, cited in Robert Owen's "Sanc
torale CatholicUm," 18S0, p. 238; aee also
Butler's "Lives of Saints.") Hence his
attributed unwillingness to exert himself
in this respect procured for him this pa
tronal status over the lazy.
Similar proverbial sayinps tend to show
further that It was not, as supposed, mere
alliteratlveness that suggested the phrase.
"As lazy as Joe the marine, who laid
down his musket to sneeze"; "As lazy as
a. Mahon soldier," i. e., an Indian Moham
medan soldier, whose physical energy was
not so great as that of a Britsh soldier;
"As proud as Cole's dog, that took the
wall of a dung cart and got crushed in
the wheel": and the uttermost depth of
laziness were reached by "David Law
rence's dog that leaned against the wall
to bark," a piece of facetiousness only
BUggeetlng that the real origin of "Lazy
Lawrence had already been forgotten.
"Lawrence bids wages was an excuse for
laziness, and "Sp. Lawrence has got hold
of you" was, and perhaps is still, a com
mon provincial saying of any one neg
lecting to work, while St. Lawrence's day,
August 10, generally a hot day, was one
on which persons were exceptionally sup
posed to shirk their usual avocations. This
eaint, whose martyrdom shook the foun
dations of a pagan unbelief, is still com
memorated in "T3t. Lawrence's tears," aa
the meteoric or shooting stars were called,
which axe said generally to make a great
display on his anniversary. .As regards
"St. Loza," Bailey'3 Dictionary, 1740, gives
"Lozelâ a lazy lubber."â Notes and

A Romance Spoiled.
"Tell a good story and stick to it," Is an
old maxim that is Illustrated in a story
that is going the rounds along the Rlalto.
A certain well known actor floated into
his home one morning about 2 o'clock.
The wife of his 'bosom was waiting for
him. He told her he had been out all thÂ«
evening with one of their friends, Charlie
B., and then related an Interesting fairy
story of how "Charlie" had taken a
crowd to supper; how "Charlie" had tcM
them a whole string of spicy tales; how
funny "Charlie" had been all the evening;
how well "Charlie" looked in his ncv
suit; how he said this, that and the other.
After telling a fifteen-minute story, to
which the gentle partner of his Joys and
out-o'-work periods listened with respect
ful attention but cynical meln, he paused
for breath. Then she, In a confident
"now-I've-got-you" tone, said:
"That's a lovely romance you've been
giving me and I hate to spoil It, but â
Charlie has been here nearly all the even-
Ing waiting to see you about an engage
mentâhe left only about half an hour
ago."
The teller of the tale looked rattier
dazed for a moment, as if he had been
struck; then, quickly gathering himself
together he assumed a bold front, with
hands in his pocket, head thrown back 'n
defiant innocence, and, emphasizing: each
word, said:
"Well, that's my story, and I'm not
going to- change It for anybody."â New

last BEST FEE.
What the Late Senator Davis Charged
a Millionaire for His Services.
"I had a case," said the late Senator
Davis, "in which I secured judgment for
a million dollars against a man, and he
was good for it. There did not seem to
be anything for him to do but to pay.
But it chanced that I was released from
the plaintiff's service and I was brought
in on the side of the defendant. I carried
his caseâ my own case, as it wereâ to the
Appellate Court, knocked $750,000 off that
judgment which I had been at so much
trouble to secure against him, and fixed
it so that $750,000 i,ou!d never get into
court again. This was pretty sharp work
and naturally my client was delighted.
He came around to see me with his face
wreathed in smiles.
" 'Splendid, splendid!" he exclaimed;
'and what Is your fee â I'll give you a
check for it right now.'
" 'Fifty thousand dollars,' said I.
" 'Flf-ty t-hâ what!' he exclaimed, near
ly jumping from his chair.
" 'Fifty thousand dollars,' said I, 'ajid
you may consider yo"urself lucky I did
not make it a hundred thousand.'
" 'I'll never pay itâ I'll never pay it,'
said my client; 'It's an outrageous bill.
Fifty thousand dollars for three or four
months' work, and heaven only knows
how many other fees you have had in
the same time, not saying anything about
the $25,000 you got 'for getting the judg
ment against me in the first piace."
" 'See bere, my friend,' I exclaimed,
getting a bit warmed up, 'let me tell you
something. For thirty years I have been
working 1 and studying and sitting up
nights learning how and getting myself
Into shape for doing just such things as
this. I've saved you $750,000 of a Judg
ment which you ought to pay, and which
you are able to pay, and my fee of $50,000
is a most reasonable one. If you say an
other word. I'll jnake it a hundred thou
sand, and if you kick on that I'll make
it a hundred and fifty thousandâ and
you'll pay it, too â you'll pay it. I'll make
you pay It.'
"He did pay it," concluded the Senator
with a chuckle, "for he gave me a check
for $50,000 before leaving the room. That
was the best fee I ever earned."â Chicago
Times-Herald.
The State Mining Bureau will issue as
a bulletin the report made by W. H.
Storms of his work in the mother lode
region of California,^ Mr. Storms reports
that there are through that portion of the
State occupied by the counties extending
from Mariposa on the Bouth to the south
ern portion of El Dorado County on the
north at least four distinctly recognizable
gold belts, which are: One skirting the
low foothills along the great central val
ley, which Includes the copper deposits
found near Green Mountain In Mariposa
County, and southward In Madera Coun
ty; those at Copperopolis and at Campo
Seco, Calaveras County, and at Ranlett,
In Amador County, and also the gold
mines of Salt Spring Valley, In CalaveraB
County. It may also be considered as em
bracing thÂ© gold mines near Hornltos, in
Mariposa County, and those near lone.
In Amador County. I
East of the first mentioned bolt Is the
mother lode. Mr. Storms prefers to call
this the central belt and remarks that the
gold-bearing mines are nowhere absolute
ly continuous and unbroken for a great
distance, but that tho lode la frequently
Interrupted by Its entire disappearance
for considerable distances. Lying east of
the mother lode in Mariposa County a
distance of nearly twenty miles and near
ly parallel with the mother lode, extend
ing in a northwesterly direction and pass
ing through Tuolumne and Calaveras
counties. Is thÂ« third gold-bearing belt,
which, In Amador County, has ap
proached to within six to ten miles of the
mother lode. Still farther eastward lies
at least one mineral belt, which has been
opened at several point*, but of which
comparatively little is known yet. Con
cerning this Mr. Storms report* that he
intends fully to Investigate it In the fu
ture, as he considers it to be one of great
promise. "The veins are large and carry
sulphides of Iron, lead, zino and copper
and also gold and silver."
The famous controversy over the Cobre
Grande mining property in Arizona has
been settled. The courts of Texas, Ari
zona and Mexico have been dealing with
it for two years. Finally, President Gage
made a proposition which has been ac
cepted. The Green faction has taken up
the Cobre Grande stock at par. While
the trouble has been on, there have been
numerous arrests and bloodshed waa nar
rowly escaped recently when there was a
clash between Green's party and the
Mexican troops.
American Mining News has a story
about an invention "that bids fair to rev
olutionize the methods of separating gold
from crushed quartz and | particularly
from river, beach and placer sands." The
inventor Is Elmer Gates. According to the
story, the secret lies in removing from
the gold-bearing sands the magnetic iron
as a preliminary to separating the gold.
Various machines have hitherto been in
vented for the purpose of dealing with the
magnetite, but they have been unable to
handle wet sand. The paper that gives
the information says that the claim Is
made that the output of gold may be
doubled by reason of the invention.
Some idea of the extent of the copper
interests cf two sections may be gained
from a report concerning the dividends
declared by the Lake Superior and Mon
tana companies this year. The total di
vidends by the Lake Superior companies
were $9,795,000. of which the Calumet and
Hecla contributed $7,000,000, and the total
of the Montana mines for this year was
$13,585,100, of which the Boston and Mon
tana Company raid $6,450,000, and the Ana
conda $4.S00,0O0. Aggregated dividends of
the Calumet and Hecla during a period of
twenty-two years amount to $72,550,000;
Boston ar.d Montana, $20,975,000; Ana.
conda, $16,590,000; Quincy. $11,970,000; Tam
arack, $7,230,000. In twenty-two years the
dividends of the Lake Superior copper
mines have amounted to $82,975,000, and
those of the Montana mines during the
cane period are represented by the total
of $43,295,000.
George Hope has written an interesting
account of the mining laws of West Aus
tralia to the Mining and Scientific Press.
In part he writes as follows:
For purposes of efficient Â¦ jurisdiction, the
auriferous country in Australia is divided Into
tepaxate gold fields, each under the charge of
a warden and a registrar. A warden's court
is established in which mining disputes are
tried, pleas for exemption from labor condi
tions heard and the like business transacted.
Ko one has a locus standi In this court with
out a miner's right, which every miner Is re
quired to secure and renew annually at a
charge of $2 60â formerly $5. Anybody can ap
pear and conduct a case, not necessarily a qual
ified 1' cal practitioner. The warden is en
dowpd with the power of a Supreme Court
Judg-e in many cases, but. being chosen for his
tact, judgment and experience, he is enabled
to check litigation and obviate expensive ap
peals. Had justice suffered under this "mild
Caesarian deFpotlsm." an outcry for a change
would have undoubtedly arisen. The contrary
has been the case; rich and poor, capital and
labor, being satisfied with the machinery pro
vided for maintaining their rights.
The dividends disbursed by the various
companies connected with the mineral In
dustry in the United States this year paid
by 2(w companies have amounted to $114,
5C7.452. The gold, copper, quicksilver, sil
vo-r, lead and zinc mines contributed $48,
750.3-32 of the total, and petroleum, coal
and coke, iron and steel companies paid
the sum cf $G3.Â£16,510. Private corpora
tions are not included in 'the returns.
Copper mines have paid 62.4 per cent of
the total. Gold and silver mines paid
J14.292.200 or 29.3 per cent of the total. Pe
troleum companies paid $37,707,947, or 32.9
per cent of thÂ«j total dividends. Of this
amount the Standard Oil Company paid
137,050,000, or 43 per cent per annum on its
outstanding capital stock. The remaining
SC57.947 was paid by Independent California
and West \ irgrinia companies.
The Western Mining World, published
at Butte, Mont., pledges the renewed sup
port of the mining men of Montana to the
plan advocated in California for the estab
lishment of a national department of
mines and mining. Quoting the resolu
tions that were adopted by the California
State Miners' Convention at Its recent an
nual meeting in this city, the World adds:
No intelligent man who at the same time Is
desirous of seeing each industry engaged in by
citizens of the United States given equal pri
vileges and protection under the laws, can con
trovert the fact that the industry of mining has
never received the protection at the hands of
the general Government that la Ha due. Nor
will its rights ever receive due recognition un
til there Is a united rffort on the part of resi
dents of the mining States to hold their Repre
sentatives In Congress to a strict accountabil
ity. Considering the proportions to which the
mining industry- has grown since 1S72. the laws
Kovernlng the location and operation of mining
claims are a disgrace to the Intelligence and a
reflection upon the honesty of the men who
year after year keep these law* upon the stat
ute books. Largely the miners themselves are
resr>onMbIe for existing conditions, simply be
cause they nenrlect to exerclBC the power avail
able. California has spoken; let Montana sec
ond the effort toward the establishment of a
rational department of mines. The time
Is ripe for action. Quit* a number
of gentlemen are desirous * of going to
Washington aa Senators from Montana. Let
tb* miners call upon their representatives In
the Legislature to exact from every candidate
for Senatorial honors a pled re to work for a
national department ot mines and for a Just
revision of the national mining laws, to th*
end that the proopector and small mine opera
tor can be prc>tectÂ«"d In their rights against the
grwd of aggregated capital, which possesses no
eoul to save nor head to thump. There must
be united action.' otherwise an effort will be
wholly unavailing.

FOUR DISTINCT
BELTS OF COLD
W. L. Watts. M. E., who has been
studying for some months the gas and oil
yielding formations of California, has
come to the conclusion that "It is reason
able to suppose that the oil fields de
scribed have their counterparts In many
places in California not yet explored, for
the geological formations, including the
oil measures thus far developed, form a
large portion of the coast ranges between
San Diego and Humboldt counties. From
the description of the oil yielding 1 forma
tions, the geological positions of which
have been determined, It appears that the
productive oil strata are sandstones un
derlying bodies of clay or lnterstratified
with them. It may be argued that these
conditions indicate natural distillation as
the chief cause of the accumulation of
petroleum In the oil measures."
This general conclusion has been fore
shadowed In previous publications. Mr.
Watts has in the present instance* a
book of 236 pages, with accompanying il
lustrative maps and pictures, the whole
being embodied in a report that the State
Mining Bureau has issued as a bulletin.
It abounds In information. Speaking of
the differences between California petro
leums and the products of the Eastern
States Mr. Watts says:
The pertoleum of the ESastern States is com
posed principally of hydrocarbons of the paraf
flne series. As previously mentioned, by far
the greater portion of the California oil is used
for tuel, and that in a crude state. It is the
general opinion of those who use oil as fuel
that, weight for weight, there ia not, much dif
ference between the luel value of oils of din"er
ent specific gravities, provided the' oils are
clean, or a suitable allowance is made for
water and other foreign substances which they
contain. A portion ol the oil is used for flux
ing asphaltum and for the manufacture oi fllu
minating gas, and a portion is refined. The
portion retlned yields crude naphtha, illumin
ating oil, gas distillate, lubricating oil and as
phaltum. The naphtha distilled from California
oils is of especial value for use in gasoline en
gines. Those who have made comparative teBts
of California and Eastern gasoline in gasoline
engines claim a superiority for the California
product. As might be expected from the fore
going statement concerning the relative compo
sition of petroleum from the Eastern States
and. the asphaltic oil of California, Illuminating
oil manufactured in this State contains more
carbon and ' less hydrogen than does illumin
ating oil manufactured from Eastern petro
leums. The result Is that, when burned under
similar conditions, California oil gives a more
smoky flame than does oil manufactured lrom
Eastern petroleum. This is due to the tact that
it requires more oxygen to effect the complete
hydrogen. There is no doubt that, as time
goes on, more use will be made of the constitu
ents of our asphaltlc oils in chemical manufac
ture. I
The oil men' are happy over the decision
of the Land Commissioner In the case of
the Kern River Oil " Company against
Clarke. J. T. Flynn, who went East for
the California Oil Exchange last Janu
ary to present the case of the mineral
claimant as against the. scripper and
homesteader, said concerning the decision
of Commissioner Hermann:
While the decision Is subject to appeal to the
Secretary of the Interior and also to the Su
preme Court of the United States, we regard !
the logic so sound and the principle so clear
that no reversal of the ruling can be hoped for
by the scrippers. As early as last February
Commissioner Hermann expressed ' his desire !
and intention to afford the miner every rea
sonable opportunity to establish the presence of
oil upon the contested lands, and it was with
that end In view that the local land office was
instructed to refuse scrip and homestead appli
cations upon the lands in .question, until a
thorough examination of the lands could be
made under the direction of the General Land'
Office. The Commissioner held - that land ] and
particularly oil land did not reveal upon the
surface Us mineral character and that the Gov
ernment, independent of the field notes, had a
right to fix the classification of such lands. -
Mr. Hermann further held that inas
much as the law compelled miners to da
velop the presence of mineral In paying
quantities in order to acaulre title. hi3
right took precedence over that of the
agriculturist, who was bound only by the
law of occupation.
An instance of the popularity which- the
Land Commissioner has achieved by rea
son of his treatment of the mineral claim
ants in the matter of lands is furnished
by the incorporation in Napa. County, of
the Blnger Hermann-Berryessa Oil Com
pany. The directors of the company are
A. V. Miller/ W. C. Cook, W. H. Gosling.
William D. McKenzle of Montlcello. R.
M. Pleasants of Winters. Dr. E. Z. Hen
nessey and T. B. Hutchinson of Napa.
- An oil strike has oeen made that ex
tends the McKlttrick district abouu threo
miles in the Temblor direction. Oil was
found at a depth of 1190 feet. Such is the
report made t>y the Bakersfleld Califor
nian.
Oil operators are now working- In Colusa
County at Guinda. A large tract of land
has been leased by a company on Sand
Creek in Yolo County. Oil companies have
recently been incorporated at Vacavlllc.
Benicla St. Helena and Oroville. Oil is
reported to have been discovered about
fourteen miles from Montlcello, in what
is known as the Zemzem country in
Napa County. Boring will soon begin at
Oroville on the Wicks ranch and also on
a tract of 1000 acres In the same locality.
Oil producers are now concerned In the
price of petroleum. Contracts in most
cases hiive to be made in January and
July. The Los Angeles Times says that
a bear movement has been under way in
the south for two months. The Times
takes this view of the situation: r ;â¢/Â¦;-.
At present petroleum may be purchased for
from $1 OS to $1 15 per barrel, f; o. b., whereas
the Â¦ price formerly .was a few cents higher.
However, very little oil has been sold at these
prices, and that only in email quantities. The
foliclting of bids for. time contracts has be
gun, but those submitted up to date are not
materially lower than heretofore. Â¦ There are
good reasons why this should be so. The Â«ock
of petroleum on storage and in field tanks has
not increased in the past six months, and for
the future authorities state that the production
cennot exceed the demand. The market is more
evenly preserved now than at any time In the
previous history of the Held. Individual own
ership has, in the majority. of cases, been done
away with, the formation of companies ab
sorbing and combining single wells into groups
and placing the entire production of each group
in the hands of one manager. These are men
ol wide business ability, who â¢ are far more
capable of holding the price of oil at a proper
figure than were , the thousand and one well
owners who strove with each other and let
their production go, â¢ when pressed for. money,
at any price- obtainable. Another . cause with
which the producer Is forced ;to 'contend
present Is Bakersneld petroleum. ' The oil men
of that field are seeking to invade the local
market with their wares, but results are not
promising. Freight rates interfere In the mat
ter and a price of $1 per barrel for L03 Angeles
crude oil would effectually shut: out the north
ern fuel.' In' seeking \ greater protection In
prices producers of the city are considering
the proposition made by a storage . company
to handle the field production for one -rear 'at
a cost of 10 cents per barrel. It la ! claimed
that should the company secure the subscrip
tion of 60,000 barrels of petroleum per month
that it will place them in such control of the
local market that $1 20 may be easily obtained.
Producers would be satisfied to secure ' this
price for their fuel, . and should the . movement
succeed the chances are -that Â¦ the combl nation
would continue '. permanently. â¢- V;- Â¦ ,.-
Bakersfleld people are talking of piping
gas from the Kern River field â¢; to their
town for municipal use. .
Jewett & Blodjret. C. J. .Berry, M/ Mc-
Whorter, "W. I. Roberts and W. M. Spen

creditors of the old Bay, State Company,.
The Bunker Hill shaft is" reported to have
been unwatered and retimered. Many or
the mines that were In the dump* during
the summer montna are looking up. ThÂ«
Record sayB that the Gwln mine yielded
$46,000 in November, the Keystone $16,000
and the Central Eureka $18,000.
The San Andreas Citizen says that'the
Installation of the electric plant at the
Sheep Ranch mine Is rapidly â¢ proceeding.
The Oriole mine at Angels is having trou
ble with water and has shut down to get
larger pumps. The Utica Company haÂ«
put in a 26-inch pipe to feed the wheele at
the cross-shaft power-house. Julius LÂ«
vaggi has bonded the Acme mine near
Plymouth and will probably bond another
property In the vicinity. Development*
near Railroad Flat are reported to be en
couraging.
According to the Tuolumne Independ
ent, the Darrow mine, near Rawhide, hai
been bonded by E. F. Doyle and William
Oakes, and they will begin at once to
work the property. The recently expired
bond on the Mount Hood property has
been extended to the 1st of June, and
sinking from the 100-foot level to the 200
foot level has begun. Preparations are
being made for ten additional stamps for
the Longfellow mine. A pipe line 10,000
feet long is nearly completed to the site
of a new 100-stamp mill -to be erected at
the Shawmut mine.
William B. Lake Is about to start up a
placer mine In Calaveras County. The
Calaveras Chronicle reports that pipe has
been laid, monitors attached and the wat
ers will soon be pouring upon the banks.
The Galvin gold dredger which has been
placed on Weaver Creek, according to the
Trinity Journal, barely escaped disaster
when It was first started up last week.
The Journal says:
After running: a short time with everything In
perfect shape, & waste t, ate on the tailings was
carried away and operations suspended. Again
the carrying away of another waste gate almost
caused a serious disaster. The lowering: of the
water caused the boat to -tilt over the exca
vation made on the preceding day and It looked
for a time as if It might be overturned. For
tunately tha red fir used in the work of the
barge was strong and stanch and the machin
ery properly put together and secured, and no
damage was done. Aa the dredger weighs
something like half a million pounds it can be
readily seen that its position for a time was
critical. Thursday Sim sacks of stone and
gravel were put into the lining and everything
Is all right again. Owing to about Â£000 Inches
of the La Grange Company's water running
down the creek it has been a little dlftlcult to
handle the same. In a few days the dredger
will have excavated Kb bed beyond the possi
bility of accident.
Various matters of mining interest are
reported by the Yreka Journal. The min
ers along the Klamath are having a great
deal of trouble in getting lumber, owing
to bad roads and long distances from the
nearest sawmills. N. H. McFadden of
Pittsburg, Pa., has been In Yreka to make
preparations for building a dredger to
work upon the south fork of Scott River.
Work has been resumed on the dredger at
Hawkinsvlllo. Swain, Newson & Cleaver,
owners of the Brown Bear and Fraction
mines on White Gulch, have recently pur
chased two concentrators, a rock breaker
and a Pelton wheel, which will be added
to their mill. This machinery was pur
chased from the Know Nothing mine.
the belief is now firm that actual work
on the road Is- soon to begin. . . Â¦ > â¢
-- A- report comes from Bakersfleld' that
the Sacramento Oil, Company's No. 5 well
broke the record In ' the Kern River field
by producing '900 barrels per day for sev
eral days after it was completed. - \
A new lot of cases Involving the contro
versies between the placer locators of oil
lands and the scrippers will come up In
Los Angeles before Judge Ross. The lands
involved are in Fresno County.*
There are thirty-seven producing wells
In the Coalinga field and twenty-five are
drilling. The Kreynhagen field has three
companies .at- work. There are but two
producing wells operating.
An exchange says:
A surprising feature of the Kern River de
velopment Is the increasing: capacity of lUe
wells. This is in- part due to the use ct
slightly deeper holes, but one more sand
stratum of normal thickness does not account
for a difference of from thirty to one hundred
barrel* a day on a forty-barrel well.
The lncreasa was first remarked, perhaps, In
the Peerless wells on section 31, 28, 2&, when
that company's No. 3 gradually went from
thirty to seventy barrels. The difference was
not explainable by the : extraction of sand for
the reason" that It had been thoroughly sand
pumped before the initial measurements. Tho
Reed Company's wells did much the sama
thing, some of them increasing from thirty
and forty to a hundred and twenty barrels a
day. The same thing Is true of all the other
properties In the southern tier of townships,
and all the wells now coming in are showing
capacities much greater than their predeces
sors on the lame ground.
The Union Oil Company's pipe lines in
the Coalinga field are both in use and all
the oil that is produced can be taken
care of.
Another oil company, the Lucky Boy,
Is about to begin development work on Its
leased land in the Midway district.
F. H. Howard, W. H. Massey and H. G.
Riser have secured a tract of 2400 acres ot
land, which they will prospect for oil, in
\entura County, in the range of hills
north of the scene of the developments at
Fillmore, Sespe and Piru. They do not
propose to organize a company, but to
work the land themselves. They have
samples of oil taken from seepages which
they consider satisfactory.
remainder of the holdings of thÂ©
Gray Eagle Company have been sold out,
and tho report Is that eighty acres
brought $200,000. The land is In the Kern
River district.
Oil indications have been found in Lower
California, about twenty miles below
Ensenada. The old Mission ranch, which
extends six miles along the ocean front
and four miles back Into the Interior, has
been leased. The belt is supposed to ex
tend Into the ocean.
The most northerly discovery made In
the Kern field is credited to the Edgar
Company, which is in the northwest cor
ner of 18, 28, 28. This adds territory to
th 4L fie i3 according to the indications."
The Old Dominion Company, In the Mc-
Kittrick district, which has a hole down
1480 feet, will go down 2000 feet, searching
for the lower sand.
The Glenn Coal and Oil Company, tha
Great Northern and the Brlscoe Oil and
Mineral Company will develop oil in
Glenn County. - .- . Â¦
The gaa works at Santa Rosa are burn-
Ing oil for fuel from -the wells of the Kern
River field. Seventy-five gallons of oil
have been estimated by the management
of the gas works to be equivalent to a
cord of nine wood in heating capacity. /'

rideratlcss that tnisht attach to rpecial stocks
ajid affect their value was apparently taken no
â¢account cf anfl there wi* a wild scramble to
buy all soru end coafi'.tlcn cf stocks, as though
â¢UI future hopes cf wealth and protjpcrlty fle
pended on aa ownership of stocks before Chritt
r. ts. Tfcere -was no news of Importance to put
Â¦my new phaJÂ»e bn the question of \aluea. pres
ect or prospective. Tfce buying seemed to rep
resect tbe cumulative effects upon the financial
settlement of the Imposing rise In prices during
the -week and the apparently undiminlsbed oon
*CÂ£enee manifeeted by lsr^e capitalists by their
continued lanre absorption of securities. At
the fail of the hammer on the chairman 1 g desk
this morning 16.000 sharee of Northern Pacine
Â¦vere Instantly bought in a einele block. First
transactions In a nuir.ber of other Important
% tocks r*ir:f â¢ i from 1C00 eharps up to 7790 shares.
With a gigantic Cbrietmas tree, decked out
with glltterlnr ornament* and festoons of
CbrtBtinas ereÂ«ns and bunting; waving over the
Â¦ floor o? the exchange, the brokers bou^bt stocks
*B/ith as much abandonment aa though they
v.-ere Â» T>aJl cf the Christmas celebration and
the rayety of the occasion dppended upon It.
The market apparently ran wild and was only
quleted by an accession of eelllner orders Invited
by the extreme advances attained by nnÂ«
ctocks. But tbe buying -was resumed In the
last bc!f hour, after the bank statement ap
p*-ared, and a Dumber of stock* wera rushed to
the top level of tbe day. Tbe closing was anl
mated and Irregular. Some of the extreme m&
vanocs were: Sugar, E%; Brooklyn Transit, 4V,;
Â«itnerai Electric, 4; St. Paul, 2'M; People's Oaa,
. i*%. and a verj' eitenfied list of stocks from 1
to 2 points.
Only irenersJ conditions cad causes can afford
Â¦ r '.Â¦ â¢;â¢:Â«â¢.- explanation tor such a stock market
i - that of tbe past week. Particular events and
Â£<-velcpmects may be accepted as stimulating
rauses or as unlocking nascent forces that have
a latent rrowtli and gestation and need but a
tlHrht Impulse to bring them JntÂ© life. That
Impulse came from last Saturday's statement.
Ever since that time thÂ« market has shown
continued -animation and variety. The opinion
has been universal In Wall etreet that a rlaÂ«
In prices would com* In January, after the
;Â«ariy financial settlements had been concluded,
end tbe funds disbursed and dividends and ln
ttreet were seeking reinvestment, but there waa
treat dread of a HjuÂ«*eze of money rates at the
end of the year, as the requirements to be met
are the lar-j^et Â«ver known >n our history. The
CLnalOiry of la.-t year's severe panic, when call
loan rates rose to IS6 per cent and stocks had to
be- thrown over at any sacrifice to meet called
leans, was vivlfily pivsent In the minds of
everybody in the vicinity of Wall street. The
cplrlt of caution waa to deep that Â¦ even the
rtrong evidence of widespread burins* of rail
road stocks by backers and conservative finan
cial Interests Z&Ued to attract a general follow.

Ing. TnÂ« pretence of the money market was
also looked at with mspiclon and It was alleged
to be due to manipulation with a view to trap
the unwary Into speculative commitments in
stocks which would have to be sacrificed before
the end of the year. Conditions during the
week hare grown appreciably easier in the
money market. The Sub-Treasury operations
have contributed to the money market. Instead
of taking from It, as last week. Pension pay
ments have reached tbe maximum for the
month, and there have been larger payment of
assÂ«.y checks for gold deposited at Taclflc Coast
points. With the approach of December 31,
which terminates the i>ertod for refunding Gov
ernment bonds Into the new twos, there has
been a rush of bonds to the Sub-Treasury lor
transfer, and the payments of premiums on
these hae been an Item In replenishing the re
source* of the banks. Money has been loaned
for account banks and financial Institutions out
side of New York on a very lame scale. These
Institutions keep a large part of their reserves
on deposit In New York clearing-house banks
and the drafts on there deposits In the course
of placing loans account for the heavy shrink
age in the loan and deposit Items of New York
banks.
Sentiment is not an entire stranger to Wall
street and the holiday spirit and rejoicing over
the prosperity which an active bull market
brings to the Stock Exchange district have
rjayed their part in keeping up the enthusiasm
The market baffles detailed analysis or descrip
tion. In the aggregate number of shares dealt
in It hae been exceeded en former occasions,
but In the breadth and variety of the dealings
it passes beyond all previous experience. The
market Beemc-d capable of absorbing any
amount of offerings without at all Impairing it's
groat animation and underlying strength.
The railroad bond market has been actuated
by sympathy with the Mock market. The low
grade is.-.ies have been the favorites and have
ma.le strongly upward with occasional reac
tions fr.jm ej-eculattve pront-taking.

CLOSING
The markets here were fairly active to-day
ani the tone satisfactory. Americans buoyant,
above parity and at close were at best. Con
siderable profit-taking was neutralized by fresh
buying. The chief features were Chesapeake
and Ohio, St. Paul, Atchlson and Â¦ Southern
corrmon. The last was largely bought. Money
was steady and the bank did a moderate busi
ness. It lost Â£55.000 gold to India.

Movements of Specie.
The Financier nays: The statement of the
New York banks for the current week is of
a very favorable character from a- reserve
standpoint, and indicates that the turn of the
year will be made without disturbance in the
money market. The banks have gainÂ«ni largely
In cofh. bcth on account of the Treasury dl*-.
burtements and receipts from the interior.
This of itself would have operated In counter
acting the influence of expanding loans and
deposit?, but as berth these items show a fur
ther shrinkare the reserve requirements have
been materially lessened "and the surplus In
creased $3,171,625. although' the cash holdings
are only $2,205,700 higher than a week ago. It
would be difficult to explain why. with the
stock market beating all records and general
business and all other conditions in a most
satisfactory Fhape. loans shuuld continue to
fall off. but the truth of the matter If that
O'ltfide banks are heavy lenders here, and whtle
new loans originate in New York, they are
placed In other cities. The decreased loan item
since the first of the month has been almoet
J17.tC0.000. Deposits have fallen oft* over $25.
090,000. while the cash reserve Is only a little
over a million less, than at that time. This
reflects the drain lrr cash, but as demands In
the Interior have been fully met there seems
to t* ground for the belief that the banks will
be able to meet all demands that may be made
by borrowers from this time on. .â¢

The burden of debt which has long ham
pered the .University of the Pacific is
about to be swept away. The ability, per
sonal energy and persuasive force of such
men as Bishop J. W. Hamilton, Dr. Hea
cock and their associates have been ac
tively employed in securing pledges of
financial assistance. Great success has
attended their efforts. The sum total of
.the debt is $60,000. Responsible pledges for
the payment of $53,000 have been secured.
The sum of $7000 is yet to be ralsed,*but
this amount must be paid in or signed for
before the first day of January. 190L
Bishop Hamilton's emergency appeal
explains that the "lawyer who drew the
subscription framed it in such a way that
all would be lost if the total of $60,000 was
not pledged by January 1.
The University of the Pacific, situate at
College Park, near San Jose, is an educa
tional institution of high character. Its
roll of graduates' embraces the names of
many leading citizens or California who
have acquired honors in public life and
success in the fields of professional activ
ity. The university is not denominational
In the accepted sense of that term, but it
has received its greatest support and
chief inspiration from Methodism In Cali
fornia. Friends of higher education, with
out regard to creed or sect, will rejoice
with Bishop Hamilton that the university
promises a long career of enlarged use
fulness.
The public-spirited people of San Fran
cisco have come to the relief of the State
University, which, owing to an unprece
dented growth has found its limited finan
cial resources inadequate to meet the de
mands for carrying on the work properly.
At a largely attended meeting in the
Maple room of the Palace Hotel last even
ing a permanent organization was effect
ed ana a committee win go to Sacramen
to and labor with trite legislators in se
curing the passage of a bill calculated to
supply the university with the desired ad
ditional revenue. The bill will provide
for a tax upon direct inheritances and for
an Increase in the charges for filing ar
ticles of . incorporation and in the, fees
imposed on foreign corporations locating
in this State.
A resolution embodying the above
articles was introduced oy William Den
man and unanimously adopted, and Mr.
Denman will take charge of the campaign
work on the bill in Sacramento.
The meeting was called to order by
Mayor Phelan, who after a short speech
introduced General N. P: Chipman as the
presiding officer. The general outlined
the growth and needs of the university
and noted the fact that it haa become
the second university in the United States
in academic attendance. Its Increase in
attendance during the last decade has
been 400 per cent, while its increase In in
come has been but seventy per cent.
General \V. H. L. Barnes said that the
work of the university must be arrested
and students turned away unless more
money was provided. The general favored
either a flat or percentage tax on corpora
tion, certificates and ne also advocated a
flat tax on individual naturalization.
Other speeches were made by W. R.
Davis and William Denman. Permanent
organization was effected with these of

COSTELLO CONTESTS THE
ELECTION OF OPPONENTS
Claims Daingerfield and GrahamWere
Favored by the Election
â¢ Officers.
Stephen V. Costello has received suffi
cient Information through a snap tally
taken during the recounting of ballots in
the Dalngerfield-Graham contest to cause
him to contest the election of both of the
contestants named. Costello filed a con
test to the election of both Judge Dainger
fleld and Thomas F. Graham yesterday
afternoon. Costello, according to the offi
cial count, received 1359 votes less than
Graham and 953 votes less than Dainger
fleld. Costello, however, .claims thatGra
ham only received 22,348 votes, while the
official figures give him 23,853 votes;, that
Oaingerfleld only received 22.265 votes in
stead of 23.477 as credited him by the Elec
tion Commissioners, and that he (Costello)
received a greater number than either.
Costello further avers that' in each of
the 303 precincts in the city the election
officers fraudulently counted five votes for
Graham which were not cast for him, four
votes for Dalngerfleld which were not cast
for him and took away one ballot in each
precinct which was cast for Costello.
Albert. Hoff, convicted of the murder of
Mrs. Mary A. Clute at her residence on
Guerrero street, December 15, 1897, but
whose punishment was fixed by the Jury
at imprisonment for life, appeared before
Judge Cook yesterday morning 'for sen
tence. Attorney Schooler, in his behalf,
made a motion for a new trial on the
grounds that the verdict was decided by
lot and was not a fair expression of the
'Jurors; that the court misdirected the
jury, and that the verdict was contrary to
law and evidence.
Assistant District Attorney Deuprey
strongly opposed the motion, .as there was
not In fact nor In law any. reason for It,
but the Judge said he^would take the mo
tion under advisement till to-morrow.
The Judge said:
"This man Hoft has been duly convicted
of murder In .the first degree, and the^
court sees no reason why the extreme pen
alty â that of death â should not have been
Inflicted."
Hoff was present In court, but he did
not eeem to take any lively Interest In the
proceedings. Â«
Captain Seymour expressed the hope
that the Judge would grant the motion for
a new trial.
"It was an outrage," said the captain,
"for the jury to bring In such a verdict.
Hoft was either grullty of the murder of
Mrs. Clute and â¢ should have been sen
tenced to be hanged, or he was Innocent
and should have been acquitted. If there
Is another trial I am satisfied the jury
will bring In a verdict that he will be
hanged."
Claims the Verdict Is
Not Warranted by the
Evidence.
