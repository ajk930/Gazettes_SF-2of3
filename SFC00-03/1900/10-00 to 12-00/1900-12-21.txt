Baron" Jptin Henry denied that he eve
had his arm around a woman on the ho
tel grounds or had any of his lady, friend?
on his lap. He denied that he had beer,
on the hillside, but admitted that Baron
Alexander had Jumped out of the window
and then "looked in with his face and
made muehrmerrlment." With that merry
thought the essential features of his tea
tlmony-closed and, the- attorneys for The
Call found nothing worthy in their opin
ion for - cross-examination.
emphatically that any one had ever seen
him .drunk in. San Rafael or In the com
pany of drunken women. He explained
the episode of smashing wine glasses a
hls brother had done, but adorned by an
alogy to another, entertaining custom in
dulged'by-Scotchmen. In which a vic
torious hunter signalizes^ his triumph by
diinking with-hls feet on the table. This,
of course, presupposes the condition tha Â«
the hunter Is not yet under the table.
*hat they knew absolutely nothing about
he affair, but Attorney. Magulre for Von
made the startling announce
(ttcnt that he had employed armed men to
ict as a" bodyguard." i
Judge Angellotti Immediately ordered
the Sheriff to disarm [all men whom tie
might suspect. He called seven of the
Baron's ruffians from the^ courtroom and
forced them to give up their pistols. -Tht:
command, was obeyed, but for the* rest of
.he day the gang of gunsters hung about
ihe courtroom.
Baron von Schroeder then ; began the
presentation of the few remaining facts
it his remarkable, plea by. placing- his
brother. Baron Alexander von Schroeder;
on the witness stand.' This ybuhg man, a.
very fiercely mustachedr nervous person,
who is not on particularly. intimate terms
of acquaintance with English, scowled,
twisted, turned, snapped Â¦* and admitted
practically what had been, sworn to
against him. He denied that either he
or the Baron, his brother, or any of their
women friends had ever been drunk. He
admitted that in the clubhouse parties, in
which the brother Barons and women had
taken part, wine- glasses had been
Smashed.
But he explained that the smashing of
glasses is a peculiar custom of German
gentlemen when they , wish to pay_ partic
ularly a compliment to a'lady; no one can
drink- again from the same ' glass. It is
.perhaps fortunate for the Hotel Rafael
that this interesting -ceremony , of gai
antry. Imported by the Baron, does not
also include the furniture.'
Baron .Alexander also admitted that on
one \ occasion -he had crawled out of the
window to the roof of the clubhouse,
but he did so only, for 'a Joke to frighten
the- ladles; Â¦ his - stomach "was behaving
well. He could not remember that he
and his women friends -had drunk cham
pagne out of beer glasses, but! he most
Indignantly declined to believe that be had
done so. He acknowledged that a woman
had once been .completely- overcome at
the clubhouse,' but from Illness, not Intoxi
cation. Dr.lHowitt of San Rafael had
been called then to attend her. but ; he
,'was not called yesterday to be asked
about It. .' ' . t-: â¢-."Â£"'

missible as showing the absence of malice.

Mr.. Preston said that defendant wn.3
not in court at that moment, but wotil.2
; arrive later in the- day, and It was stipu
i lated that he should then be permitted to
take ' the stand.
Mr. Preston explained that the "passe*"
referred to by witnesses of t3Â» previctu
day were not free passes, but were rail
road transportation furnished on account
and paid for by The Call. He desirei
either that the fact be adaittsd or that
he be allowed to prove; It.
Magulre said he had no objection *o de
fendant belnsr allowed to prove thetfacr.
W. Sv Leake. manager of The Call, waj
called to the stand and he testified that
the transportation was furnished on ac
count for advertising. He said:
""We have advertising contracts with ail
the railroad and steamship companies'.
We can make requlsltlonr at any time ani
receive transportation, it being charged
against us in each ca3e. The Call has re
c 'ved no free passes from any railroad

I would like to explain why he re

HAS OPIiNION
OF THE BARON
BARON J. H. VOK SCHROEDEP
has, closed his case for Hbe!
against The Call. . He has sub
mitted his last word of teetlmonj
and Introduced no Important, evi
dence except his own j and that
of his brother. Baron Alexander von
Schroeder. Sot a ' single witness was
placed upon the stand to speak a word
in behalf of the Hotel Rafael during the
reign of the Von Schroedera. No guest of
the hotel, no citizen of the town was
called upon' to "swear that tbe hotel' wa>
of fair repute while the. Von Schroeder>
reveled, and caroused and debauched.
An effort was nxatlfe to impeach the tes
timony and character of only cne of the
many witnesses placed upon the stand b>
The Call and the endeavor failed. To tht
surprise of listeners _ the Barons adnilttec'
under oath that the facts of the Incidents
related against them were true, but that
they were not ImmcraU, To give climax
to a day of sensational "interest severa'

who were ready to be assassins, and wht
ss a bodyguard to Baron von.Schroedei
had assembled and were on guard In thÂ«
courtroom, were ordered. out by.theSherilt
and disarmed. And then both sides-closed
the case. Jhe attorneys; for The-'Call d*
dared their readlnÂ»s^ to submit the case
without argement, but the plaintiff, woulc
not consent and to-uay the closing argu
ments will be made and tbe case given
to the Jury.
The first surprise of the session yester
day was the effort of Von Schroeder's at
torneys to prove that William H. Jewel*,
who testified to the shocking character ot
the drunken ride' and debauch- of \"Jn
Schroeder_andj_fels JrIen^^to_a_j-o_adJ^ouse. ,
had 'a deep prejudice
and had applied to him a ! vile epithet.' The
result of that effort was Jewell's asser
tion that he'applled r a.viie epithet to Von
Echroeder, and j had declared . th4t Â¦ ever>
man in San Rafael who has a. family and
tares for it should tell all he knew'of.thv
Immoralities of the -Baron In order, thai
he might be driven from the community
If San Rafael were not the last sink hoi*
in creation, the witness declared, such be
ings as Baron von ' Schroeder " would bf
tarred and feathered and ridden on a rail
out of tbwn. â¢ This was Â¦ the testimon}
which opened Baron von Schroeder's plea
for damages to his reputation.
Then he attempted to show that Jewell"?
reputation for Integrity and honesty U
not cood. Two witnesses, M. Murray and
J. J. Murray, father aid son. took the
stand and declared that they would' not
believe Jewell under oath. It was shown
then that they arÂ« stablemen and liver'j
keepers who have been patronized by Van
Schroeder for years. and are now enjoying
his bounty. Two other witnesses, both # ol
standing, swore that Jewell's . reputation
is of the best and that they have known
nim for years. ... ......
The. plaintiff took another tack. He
made absolutely no effort to impeach the
character of any other .witness who had
testified against him. who had. pictured
him as a moral pariah, a drunken reveler,
utterly unscrupulous in his relations with
women, whose reputations he staked
against his sensuality. ' The character of
these men Baron von Schroeder Â¦ did not
attack. He Introduced two witnesses, two
men who were members. of 'a. night, carer
party in which there was. a solitary mar
ried woman, to swear that this woman,
who had imbibed several intoxicating
drinks, was not drunk. /, "
The engineer of the Hotel Rafael gave
the distance between the/clubho*ise ana
the main hotel and showed that Jt is'
small. The jury was taken to Inspect* the '
grounds, and 'with the- exception of "his
own testimony and' that of his brother
Baron von ''Schrbejitr, had closed his case.
While the -jury -was making its Jnspec
-ion excitement reigned in the courtroom
and in the Courthouse. During* the prog
'ress of this trial Baron von Schroeder hai
hp.n in his employ, a - band â¢ of armei ' men
recruited irom . various places and mar
shaled by a notorious -ruffian. These men
have prowled around :the grounds, of. the

rode pas* the Cu<5a.fay mansion, on Thirty- '

peeing the letter, found it contained the
information that the vxjucg nan had been
kidraped and was safe, and was being j
held for a ranscin. Three hours later Mr.
Cudahy received, through the mails, a
s<Â»cond ccmiauiJcaiion detailing the con

Â¦Â»as that Mr. Cudahy should deposit $25,000
in gold coin. !n a place Indicated, about
f.ve miles COfth of the city, en a lonely \
road leading up the bank of the Missouri j
River.
Mr. Cudahy, shortly after supper, en- 1
tfTf^i a light road buggy, and, after se- j
cur;n^ the money, started out entirely j
â¢lone for the place of meeting of the kid- j
rapers. . To identify himself he had at-!
tachetJ to the dashboard of his buggy a.]
red lantern, which was one of the condi- i
tiona of the letter. Mr. Cudahy drove
north on the Fherrnan avenue road to- a
point about five mile* from the city,
where he found, near the road a white j
!2r,t<=rn 9uÂ«r^r.dÂ«Mi from a short stake !

tp*n tratchinp for as the place to leave j

placed the bag of gold conveniently near!
the stak*. and. without waiting for de

returned to the city without hearing a

That the bandits wÂ«?re ntr the spot and
at or.ee secured the valuable package
cannot be flcmbted. for about 1 o'clock this
morning the voung man ran breathlessly
tp to the front door of his father's home
and rang the bell for admission. Two
policemen, who. in the early e-.-eriir.g, had
r*-*n placed rear the family mansion, had
later been sent to the etables by Mr.
Cudafcy. who feared that, should tbe nen
rrfam the boy and see the policemen,
they would drive away without leaving
him. The boy carae in so suddenly the po
iice knew nothing of it until a rcetab^r
cf the fasily went to the stables and in
formed them that the young man had re
turned and that their services could be
d'Eps-nsed witn.
Story of the KHnnped Boy.
Tour-g Cuiahy told the following story:
P> >aid that he was In front of General
Cowln's house, just across the street from
his own home, on his way back from the
Rnstin residence. Tuesday evening, when
two men approached him. One of then
cteppfc 1 up fo him and said: "We are
S^rifTs from Sarpy County and arrest
you as Eddie McGee. who escaped from
the reform schooL"
The lad protested that he was not-the
mythical Eddie McGee. but his captors
sai<5 that he would have to be Identified.
ThÂ»y placÂ«?d him In a bugjry anddrove to
Thirty-sixth street and thence south to
LÂ«av en worth street. AÂ» they approached
Leavenworth street a motor car passed
them. The lad recognized the conductor
End *aid to his captors: "There Is a, man
who knows me; he ran Identify me.** But
ti:e captors Immediately blindfolded him
and whipped up the horse. The lad thinks
that they crossed Leavenworth street and
then drove In a southwesterly, direction.
Presently they cams to a house, which.
in the opinion cf the lad. is in the south
western part of South Omaha.
Young Cudahy was- taken from the
bvggy and placed in a room and chained
to the Coor. He remained there all night
and the next His, hands- were tied
and the chains on his feet -prevented him
from getting a good view of his surround
ings even after tfce blindfold had been re
inov<?d. He knows, however, that he waa
in an empty room and that the blinds on
the windows were closed.
On the trip to the place of imprisonment
the men, he said, talked a little about
themselves. He gathered from them that
there were *ix in the gang. One of these
men came from Mexico recently and from
Denver very lately and was an expert in
the kidnaping business. After the mys
terious house was reached one man
gusrded him during a greater portion of
the day.
At night, for some unknown reason, the
men released young Cudahy from his
chain and said. "We are going to take
you home-" Then they led him to a
hack. He was driven rapidly through the
darkness to Thirty-seventh and Leaven
worth greets, where he was allowed to
leave the carriage. From there he walked
home, arriving there shortly after l
o'clock In the morning. The bandits made
no explanation to him why they gave him
his freedom. . . .
Guard Grows Garrulous.
Speaking of his experience while in the
power of the kidnapers young Cudany
"I could tell by the way the men's foot
steps resounded throughout the hou=e
that It was vacant and stripped of furni- j
ture. I observed also that they struck n<>
li^ht. I mould have been conscious of a
sense of light had they made one. for the
bandage could not have excluded all It3
rays. The men still moved about In abso
lute silence, exchanging no word. One of
them found an old rickety chair some
where arid pushed me down on It. Then
he removed the cords from around my
wrists and substituted for them a pair Â«>f
handcuffs with chains attached, and made
the latter fast to the rung* of the chair.
A pair of leg-Irons were clapped upon
my ankles, and the chains of these were
also locked about the leg-s of the chair.
"In this uncomfortable position I spent
most of the twenty- four hours of my in
carceration, though at one time, for a pe
riod of about five hours, I should Judge,
the chains from my wrists were removed
and I was permitted to He down on the
Coor. One of my captors provided .an
overcoat, which served as a pillow. â¢- 1
. tried to sleep, but my nerves were too
badly shattered to permit It.
â¢ "During all of this time I partook of no
nourishment but once, although the man
I who was with me often asked me If I
wanted anything. Once I said I did, and
he went and got me a cup of coffee and
I some . crackers.
"The man who kept watch over roe was
drinking heavily all the time. At first
he did not talk at all. but after we had
been alone together for six or^ seven
hours he. began .to get garrulous. He
talked about all sons of things and his
talk rambled throuehout, whether from
j driok or design I could not say. Flnally
he became, bolder. Two or three times he
j touched upon tfce subiect of my abdac
tion and I gathered from his remarks that
i there were six men in the gang of which
he was a. member. He said one thius
which was very much to the point and
which startled me.
The boy to-night Is apparently none the
worse for bis experience.
Late to-night Mr. Cudahy announced he
would pay $3,000 reward for the appre
hension of the abductors of his son.' $5000
for one and $15,000 for two of them.

any of the occasions mentioned by Mr. Peters,
there was any lady in the parties of which he
testified that you and Baron von Schroeder
were members who was drunk?
Mr. Delmas â One moment. If your Honor
please. That question is objected to upon the
ground that you cannot predicate a question to
a witness upon his assumed understanding ol
what the testimony of another witness Is. . We
object to It upon that ground.
Mr. Maguireâ It simply calls his attention to
the occasion.
The Court â I suppose you would have a right
to ask the witness if- he remembers the witness
Bernard Peters while employed at tHe hotel,
and you would have a right to ask him whether
on any of the occasions on which he acted as
an attendant there was
Mr. Maguire (interrupting)â I will take that
course. . - .Â»

jection is leveled.

ters while he was employed as an attendant at
the clubhouse of the Hotel Kafael?

you and your brother, the plaintiff in this
action, were members?
A.â Yes; sir.
Q.â Was any woman of any of the parties
mentioned by Mi*. Peters 'on a"ny of those oc
casions drunk?
Mr. Delmasâ That is the same question to
which we have objected, If your Honor please,
and I think the counsel need not be . chary of
time. It will. take less time to put the question
in the proper form. That Is the same identical
question.. "Were any on those occasions?"
That Is 'the occasions which it may be, and
must be assumed, for the purposes of the
question
Mr. Maguire (interrupting)â I will change the
form, then, and say on any occasion when Mr.

woman of the party drunk?

the occasions on which -Mr. Peters waited upon
any party, of which you and the plaintiffs were
members, were there any glasses broken by the
parties?
A. â Yee, sir.
Q.â Will you etate the circumstances under
which the glasses were broken, and by whom
they were broken?
A.â Sometimes when we drink the health of
a lady we break the glaes as a kind of compli
ment to the lady, that we never drink out
of that glass again. That was the object of
breaking the glasses.
Q.â Mr. von Bchroeder, I want slnply to re
mind you that in this case we desire to go
through with the examination without men
tioning the name of any lady who was con
nected with any of the matters under inquiry.
Both Fides have agreed to that course, and I
want you lo keeD It In mind. Were there any
glapres broken on any of those occasions by

A.â I did.
Q.â Please state what those Instructions were.
A.â My instructions to Mr. Leake
were that in all cases where news was
brought in affecting, persons or cor
porations he should be particular to
verify all, every bit, before publish
ing any, no matter how good* the
news might be. And also my instruc
tions were that, in the event of the
paper having made ' a mistake in the
matter , of having givÂ«n some news
which was not straight, to always re
tract, and do it in as large print as
was. the article .which first gave the
notice. â¢ .
Q.â Have those instructions, Mr. Spreckels.
been rleorously enforced In I that paper- and
about Its management ever since you have be
come the owner and publisher of It?
Mr.' Magulreâ Objected ; to as Irrelevant, im
material and Incompetent, leading and' suÂ£
gettive. It Is not for him to say as a matter
of Judgment that those things have been done.
He may show what was done :
The Courtâ I don't know as I quite appreciate
the full meaning of the word "enforced" in
that .connection.. Â¦Â¦-â¢Â¦. â¢ Â¦ .- - â¢ 'Â¦-
Mr. Delmasâ I will ask you -that; enforced by

Mr. Magulreâ Note an . exception.
The Courtâ You can answer that yes or no,
Mr. Spreckels. .Â¦ . ;";-,;.-.
A. â 1 will answer yes.
Mr. Delmas; Q. â Have those Instructions ever
been rigorously and constantly enforced, "so
far as you have any knowledge? ,
Mr. Magulreâ That Is objected to as im
material. Irrelevant and Incompetent, leading
and suggestive.
. The Courtâ 1 don't know as you are entitled
to this particular answer, Mr. Delmas. It
seems to me that you have gone aa far as you
are entitled to go. -
Mr. Delmasâ If that is your Honor's opinion
I will ask another question, then, subject to
your Honor's ruling.

hotel books. If so he could testify. la
any case testimony would be demanded.
Mr. Magulre said the young lady book
keeper would have ii> be called. Later

â¢That Is a play," Maguire said.
"No, it is not a play." said Preston. "It
Is an offer to submit the case."
"That is a play to the gallery," Maguire
insisted.
"I hardly think that is a proper re
mark," Delmas said. "We are r^ady to
submit this cane to the Jury If your Honor
is ready to charge the jury."
"Perhaps the court tad better take ;ha
responsibility and Bay that it is not ready
to charge the jury." said Judge Angel
lotti with a smile.
"I suggest that some arrangement be
made this evening about tha time for ar

PARIS. Dec 20.â The suit of Charles
Wertheimer, the London bric-a-brac deal
er, against Count *Boni de Castellane to
recover payment for art objects sold the
Count and Cour.tess de Caetellane, began
to-day In the First Civil Chamber. The
transaction Is taken as a test case and
Involves the sum of 12.450 francs. The
hearing was devoted to the arguments of
counsel. None of the parlies was in
court. The total turn involved in the
transaction is C.SOO.WO francs.
Count and Countess de Castellane have ;
replied with a counter suit demanding a j
full statement of all transactions, dairy- I
Ir.g that various objects were sold at !
scandalously exaggerated prices and that i
many articles were represented as au- !
thentic antiquities when they were real- j
ly imitations, modern or useless, while in i
a series of exchanges in 1$W Wertheimer j
took back a number of articles at prices i
ffreatly inferior to their true worth. They, |
"therelore. demand a reduction of the deot, i
provisionally esttmaxca to oe at least two !
million irancs, ana ine restitution of the i
oojt-cts taken in exchange by Wertheimer j
under the penalty of a thousand francs j
for each day s deiay in the restitution on [
the day of judgment. Finally they claim ;
oamages to the amount of JWO.uw francs. |
Count and countess de Castellane also
ask that in case the judges sm-uld decide
lurther light is iiecued on the subject,
that experts shall be appointed to ap- I
praise tne articles involved. T fte appoint- |
ment cf these experts is the llrst aim of :
counsel for the easiellanes.
Werihtimer's counsel, Aialtre Foucald. j
In a Bpcocil la.siing several hours, made a j
most vigorous- !y worded reply to the Cas- i
tellane conteiuions. He eaid there was ;
nothing serious in the observations and
criticisms "behind which the Castellanes
were screening their temporary insol
vencv." He denounced the Count's con
duct* scathingly, referring to his "pre
texts to delay payments," and did not
hesitate to accuse him of telling un
truths. Counsel explained how the Count
cheerfully accepted all the tranpaetions,
expressing satisfaction until the last mo
ment, when he turned and accused Wer
the'.mer of usury.
Maitre Foucald presented details of the I
various transactions ana replied to the j
contention that the articles were sold at
exaggerated prices. He explained that
Count Boni de Castellane sold a number
of articles and Wertheimer a-sked the
buyer at what price he would resell them
to him. The price asked was above those
at which Wertheimer sold the articles.
Counsel quoted one article in a batch
â¢which the Count asked Wertheimer to
*ell on the evening of his departure for
JCew York. Count de Castellane, counsel
eaid. asked a higher price than he had
paid for the article. Wertheimer, never
theless, sold the batch at the Count's flu
ur*>8.
Nothing could be more ralnful. assented
Maitre Foucald, than the steps taken by
the Caste'lanes to avoid the suits. Who
could reproach Wertbeimer for nlacing
confidence in the man who had contracted
marriage with The richest heiress in the
world, one w hose fortune the press de
scribed a? fabulous. The Count, when
J-aid pressed, told Wertheimer that Mr.
Gould would pay.
The Count's conduct at this period, ac
cording to counsel, resembled that of a
child. He was surprised at his Â¦wrong
doing:, and requested, his creditors to keep
from Mr. GouM the real Â«xtent of his In
debtedness. Later the Count affirmed that
liis own brother would pay Wertheimer.
but through his brother's lawyers, not
through his fthe Count's! hands.
"What an affront!" said counsel. "Count
Boni was thus obliped to admit that his
own brother would not trust him with
money."
Maitre Foucald here contrasted Count
Boni's conduct with the erlorious tradi
tions of the Castellane family. One felt
grieved, he said, to find such falsehoods
written with the pen of a Castellane.
Count de Castollane wired Wertheimer.
after his arrival in New York, that he
was we!l E.itlsFed with the voyage, -which ]
counsel said Wertheimer interpreted as
meaning that the Goulds would finance
him. j
Counsel for Count de Castellane. Maitre
Bonnat, actinsr for Coudert Bros, of New j
York, contended that* Wertheimer had |
been striving to prevent the case from
coming before the courts, but the result
had been unfortunate for him as the na
ture cf Werthelmer's business must be
exposed.
Maitte Bonnat said George J. Gould
considered that Y.'ertheimer had given |
credit to a your.g married couple who had j
no thorough CDmprehension of the value â¢
of money, on terms very advantageous to !
himself. Werthoimer. counsel contended, I
while giving Count de Castellane time to j
pay. offered to make exchanges whereby i
he took back the finest objects of his col
lection. Wertheimer had no right to say
Count de Castellane was pursuing a dis
honorable course.
Counsel claimed that Wertheimer had
â¢ abused the confidence of the young peo
ple, and If the latter had committed fol
ios it could he said that for the last j
eighteen months they had been cruelly
atoning for them. Moreover, henceforth
they would devote themselves to wiping
out the Indebtedness.
Before the conclusion of the argument
the case was adjourned for a week.

WASHINGTON, Dec 20.â When the
Senate Committee on Agriculture re
sumed its hearing on the Grout oleomar
garine bill to-day Senator Allen of Ne
braska, a member of the committee, made
a pointed and sensational statement con
cerning his position as to the measure.
He never had announced, he said, whether
he was in favor or opposed to the pending
measure, but' by reason of some questions
he had asked yesterday it was supposed
by the lobbyists present that he wouM
antagonize the measure. Since the hear
ing of yesterday he had been flooded with
telegrams urging him to support the bill.
The conclusion was obvious. With some
vigor he said:
"I â¢want to enter my protest against this
cheap John, peanut, political method. I
have no words to express my utter con
tempt for this method and for those who
would engage in it. The lobbyists who
are supporting this bill are doing it more
injury than its open and avowed oppo
nents."
Rathbone Gardiner of Providence, rep
resenting the manufacturers of oleomar
garine, continued his argument begun yes
terday in opposition to the pending bill.
In the course of his" argument â¢ he men
tioned "process butter." In response to
an inquiry, one of his clients explained
what "process butter" was. He declared
that "process butter" was "washed with
sulphuric acid" to remove the rancidity.
Governor Hoard of .Wisconsin,! with
some feeling, combated the statement,
maintaining that no occasion whatever
existed for its treatment 1 with add.
Discussing the coloring of oleomarga
rine, the natural color of which was near
ly white, Mr. Gardiner said the oleomar
garine manufacturer used anato, which is
a. harmless preparation.
Continuing his argument, Mr. Gardiner
declared that the purpose of the advo
cates of the Grout bill was not to regu
late the oleomargarine Industry but to de
stroy it.

REAPPORTIONMENT
OF THE HOUSE
Census Committee Files a
New Bill Arranging the
Membership.
Crumpacker Presents Independent
Report to Abridge Representation
in the South in Ratio to
Suffrage Abridgment,
WASHINGTON. Dee. 20.âRepresenta
tive Hopkins, chairman of the Committee
en Census, to-day filed in the Houep the
majority bill reported by his committee,
f.xing the membership of the House for
ihe next decade at .*".
Representative Burleigh of Maine filed a
minority report signed by six members in
favor of a House to be cojpposod of 3SG
member?, and Representative Cmmpaoker
cf Indiana, who signed the Burleigrh re
port, also submitted an Independent re
port in favor of reducing the representa
tion in the Southern States to the exten;
cf the abridgment of the suffrage. His
Independent report favors a House to be
composed of 374 members.
Hopkins, in the majority report, cites
many Instances to show that the loss of
Feats by States under reapportienrnent
bilis was not uncommon. Massachusetts.
for instance, which under the third cen
ijs had twenty members, was reduced to
ten under the sixth, seventh and eighth,
ar.d Virginia, which had twenty -three in
the third, had but r.in<- under the ninth.
The report says the committee followed
The plan adopted under the sixth census
pnd followed continuously, since. It has
the sanction and approval of sixty years
cf national existence. The .plan is to di
vide the constitutional population by 357,
the proposed membership. The quotient
20S.S68 is the ratio of Representatives to
population. This ratio, applied to the
population of each State, will yield in the
aggregate a number somewhat less than
357, the number determined upon as the
membership of the House. The differ
ence ie made up by assigning to the
States having the largest majority frac
tions additional Representatives until a
sufficient number have been assigned to
bring the total up to S57. A membership
of more than 357. the report says, would
make the House unwieldy.
The minority report, signed by Messrs.
Burleish. Russell. Heatwole. Crumpacker,
Griffith and Wilson, proposes as a substi
tute for the Hopkins measure a bill fix
ing the total number of Representatives at
SSb instead of 357, as In the Hopkins bill.
Referring to the Hopkins apportionment
the minority report says:
The anomalous character of thi* proposed
apportionment, re well as Its obvious Injustice.
is clearly demons-trated by the fact that it Is
necfssari'.y based. In part, upon majority frac
tions, and yet Colorado with a majority frac
tion of 121.3C and Florida with a majority
fraction of 110.S86, <1o not receive a Representa
tive based upon euch majorltj- fraction, while
every other Ftate with a majority fraction re
ceives a RppreEentatlve for Fuch a majority
fraction.
We believe that every State should be treated
alike with reference to its majority fraction,
ae no valid reason hue been or can be assigned
f^r the discrimination between them. We also
believe that in the new apportionment no State
should lose a Representative. Therefore we
recommend a House consisting of 3S6 mem
bers.
In reaching: thle number we have adopted the
rr.?thrÂ«(l used ty the committee. We take the
computation haseM on SM Representatives, upon
a ratio of one Representative for every 134, 182
of population. Nebraska, with a majority frae
tlnn of S7.6^>. and Virginia with a majority
fraction of UtJtU, each lose a Representaive
and get no Representaive for the majority
fraction in either case. These are the only
States having majority fractions that fail to
pet a Representative therefor. This eeems to
us an injustice. Therefore. following the.
precedent In the case of New Hampshire and
Florida in 1S72. we assign to each of these
State* one Representative for each majority
fraction, thus adding two to the whole number,
making in all 3S6 Representatives.
Cnder this the gain is as fallows: Arkansas,
California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida,
Louisiana. Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri,
North Carolina, North Dakota, ;WÂ»ahlngton,
Â¦West Virginia and Wisconsin gain one Repre
sentative each; Minnesota. New Jersey and
Pennsylvania gain two; Illinois. New York and
Texa* gain thre*. â¢
We euhmit that thle apportionment, involving
on Increase in the membership of the House
of twenty-nine. 1Â« in line with the uniform
f-rsictlce of the House increasing its size so aa
to keep pace, aa the case may be. with the
population of the country. No practical incon
venience as to the seating capacity of the
House can result from this increase.
The independent report of Crumpacker
is a lengthy document which goes ' ex
haustively Into the abridgment of the
right of suffrage In the Southern States.
In the beginning he quoted the fourteenth
amendment to the constitution, providing
that when the right to vote Is abridged,
except for population in rebellion or other
crime, the representation shall be reduced
in such States In proportion to such
abridgment.
"Congress in this matter." . Crumpacker
says, "must take cognizance of current
history and of facts disclosed by official
records." â¢ â¢
Crumpacker then takes up '. the consti
tution of Ix>uieiana and adduces figures
to show that In that State 43.74 per cent
of the citizens are disfranchised. The
representation should, therefore, he ar
gued, be reduced from seven to four. In
North Carolina, for the same reasons, he
figures thct the representation should be
reduced from nine to six; in Mississippi
from seven to four, and in South Caro
lina from Â«lx to four. The subterfuge re
sorted to In the South to evade the law,
he says, marks the beginning of political
demoralization and social decay. He then
proceeds to a severe arraignment of the
South in many localities of which "the
trampling under foot of laws calculated
to secure the exercise of political privi
leges to the negro has continued for so
long that it is showing its vicious fruits
In the prevalence of mob law.". He de
nounces the frequent resort to lynch law
and its unspeakable horrors, saying that
it is the- legitimate result of a generation
of disregard of election laws.

Heavy Atlantic Malls. Â£>Â£Â«â¢â¢:'
The North German Lloyd steamer
Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse arrived to-day
with 690 cabin and 641 steerage passengers
and an unusually heRvy mall. The pos

was 275.000. There â¢ were 5829 registered
letters, making 2276 sacks of -mall.- The
postage on about ' 40.000 letters was* In

STEAMSHIPS FOR
FOREIGN TRADE
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Dec. 2O.-Harry
Corson Clarke, the actor, had the alter
native to-day, on his arrival from Stock
ton, of either retracting the 'statements
he was said to have made early In the
year against Madeleine Brugulere, for
merly of his' company, or being horse
whipped by R. T. McKisick. the brother at
the lady mentioned.
The trouble which culminated to-day In
an absolute retraction in. writing on the
part of Clarke, dates back to his last
year's season on the road with "What
Happened to Jones." Miss Brugulere
who; In private life. Is Mrs. Pedar Bru
gulere, was a member of Clarke's com
pany, and, shortly after leaving San
Francisco, trouble arose between the com
edian and the members of his company.
Madeleine Bruguiere, Cecelia Castelle
Ida Banning and Mlnetta Barrett all left
Clarke's company- within a few days in
the month of February' last, and, in Inter
views had with Clarke, he was alleged to
have made certain statements reflecting
on the behavior of Madeleine Brugulere
and other ladies of the company. Among
the statements attributed to Clarke were
those in which he asserted that his wife
could, not associate with the ladles of the
company, that Mlas Bruguiere and Miss
Plunkett had been guilty of smoking
cigarettes in public, and that they had
purloined spoons from hotels at which
they had stopped.
The ladles Indignantly denied the accu
sations alleged to have been made by
Clarke, and their version of the trouble
in the company was that the actor was
suffering from a severe case of self-ad
mlratlon
Young McKlslck stated last February
that the first time he met Clarke he would
make him retract the reflections made
against his sister, and to-day won a com
plete victory over the actor.
When the train pulled Into the depot
here from Stockton, McKisick was In
waiting, and as soon as Clarke alighted
from the cars a wordy war arose between
the two men. The driver of the hotel
omnibus induced the parties to settle the
matter at the hotel, and Clarke and Mc-
Klslck proceeded to take the driver's ad
vice. McKisick, it is said, was prepared
to horsewhip the actor if the retraction
was not forthcoming. Clarke is eaid to
have compiled with the request when he
found that the young .attorney meant
business. McKisick refuses to discuss the
matter.
Harry Corson Clarke was seen to-night
after the performance at the Clunle
Opera-house. He said that the story to
which McKlslck took exception was tele
?xaphed from Kansas City to certain Cali
ornia newspapers and represented him
as using offensive language toward Mrs
Brugulere, sister of a Sacramento lawyer'
and at that time one, of the members of
his company. Clarke denied positively to
night that he ever made use of the lan
guage attributed to him, and that as a
matter of fact his wife. and Mrs. Bru
gulere are close friends. He said that
when McKislck met him at the depot to
day he was- considerably excited and at
his suggestion McKislck followed him. to
the hotel, where the Interview was-re
sumed. , >,
Clarke says that when, McKlslck left
he appeared to be'satisfled with the ex
planation. He says he does not know
how the story from , Kansas City origi
nated unless It was made .up by some
enemy, and that he did not see It until he
ran across a California newspaper con
taining it some time later.

New Possessions Within
the Jurisdiction of the
Instrument
Counsel for Plaintiffs in Philippine
Case Holds That the Islands
Are Part of the United
. States.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 20.â The closing
argument in the Philippine and Porto R!co
cascr. v.as made in the Uri:ied States Su
preme Court to-day, and the cases were
submitted for the final adjudication of
the court. As the Government's case had
been closed' by the- Attorney General, it
remained onlj to hear the senior counsel
in the PhU.ppine case/ Charles. H. Aidrlch
of Chicago, former Solicitor. General, who
had one and a half hours remaining of the
five hours given to the plaintiffs.
Mr. A.drich had before him the ,plaln
tlft's brief and a ' voluminous portfouo of
nou's, but he spoke Ireely, with only cc
caj.onal references to them. At me out
set he sad he would confine h-mseif.
largely to legal argument, following the
Attorney GentTal's points and setking io
meet mchi, althougr. 'he regarded much
thai the- Attorney oeneia. hau presented
as irrc-.cvawt. .. ' Â¦'.
He first directed his attention to the
clrt^n.c-iancec under which the Govern
ment, came into existence; the struggle
for liberty and the American protest
against England's assertion of the taxing
power over the American colonies. : yVjtii
this history before us, he said, it "was a
remarkable fact that the Attorney Gen
eral of the United States, over 100 years
after the. great struggle which founded
the :American Government.:; should come
into this court and assert a taxing power
more extreme than had been asserted by
the most ardent defenders of England's
taxing power over the colonies.
Mr. Aldrich spolte of the decision of
Justice Marshall In - Loughborough vs.
Blake as of decisive importance,: and he
summed up * that decision as bearing on
the present conditions as follows: .â¢ . \ -
That the power to tax." levy duties,' etc', ex
tends" to the entire United States. .
That the term "United States" embrace*
"our.,ffreat republic, which Is composed of
States and. Territories." . .
That "It 'Is .not' -leas : necessary, 'on the* prin
ciples of our constitution, that uniformity in
the lmpocltlon of Imposts, duties and- exclsee
should be observed-ln the one than the other."
It follows from the above that the rights and
obligations of the territory thus a part of ths
United States and the inhabitants are measured
and tested by the constitution. . Â¦ " ;- -. =. â¢
As to the contention that the Philippine*
were not a part of the United States, Mr.
Aldrich said:
If the Islands ceded by Spain are foreign
territory, then our country would have as its
commercial representatives the foreign Consuls,
who would perform the requisite official act*
prescribed by our customs laws regarding ship
ments or merchants from any of these Islands
to any part of the United States. If the Islands
are not American territory, they must still be
Spanish, for It Is not pretended that any other
nation foreign to the United States has ac
quired any sovereignty over them. m>r Is it
pretended that the Philippine Â¦ Islands, In the
eye of international law, occupy the statue of
an independent nation.
The Attorney General's interpretation
of the word "sovereignty," Mr. Aldrich
said, was that this Government had a
right to do what any other nation does.,
This word had become most popular since
we entered upon a colonial policy. But,
Mr.". Aldrich declared, the sovereignty of
the -United States was one exercised
under the constitution, and if we are- in
the Philippines or. Porto Rico it is be
cause of the powers given by the consti
tution. Â¦ *; .
Justice "White interposed a question
when Mr. Aldrich referred to the Ameri
can protest against British "taxation
without representation."
Would this mean, the Justice asked.
that Congress could not tax the new pos
sessions, until they, were represented in
Congress? . ; :â¢--.. Â¦ ,
Mr. Aldrich said that it did not go that
far and it was sufficiently answered In
the case of Loughborough versus Blake.
- Mr. Aldrich said he entered a protest
against-: the use of Jefferson's name in
support of the proposition that the United
States can acquire and hold territory in
definitely. It was settled beyond ques
tion that Jefferson himself had not .re
garded the Louisiana purchase as consti
tutional, and believed that a constitution
al amendment was necessary.
Justice Gray asked his first question at
this point. Inquiring if counsel held thnt
the Louisiana acquisition was unconsti
tutional.
Mr. Aldrich answered that he did not so
hold, but that Mr. Jefferson had so held,
and the arguments of that day showed
how political Influences affected final re
sults.
Justice Brown asked If it was safe to
base Judicial action on the arguments of
contemporary politicians. <
"I think not." answered Mr. Aldrich.
"and I refer to them only, because they
occupy three-fourths of the brief of the
Attorney General.".
I In speaking of executive action Mr.
Aldrich referred to President McKlnley's
message stating -that it was "our plain
duty to abolish all customs tariffs be
tween the United States and Porto Rico."
Justice Shiras asked if .the . President
was then speaking of the duty of Con
gress.
Mr. Aldrich said he supposed the Presi
dent meant the duty of the nation.
Justice Harlan also asked if the treaty
power could go beyond the fourteenth
amendment to- the constitution, to which
Mr. Aldrich answered that treaties could
not override the- constitution.-
After citing Mr. Mansfield's opinion on
the limitation of the power of the King
and Parliament, Mr. Aldrich said:
"It is a startling proposition that a
power denied to- Parliament as inconsist
ent with liberty and "consonant only with
tyranny belongs to the Congress of the
United States in one case and to the
President thereof in another; that a
power the assumption of which Justified
the rebellion and prolongation of bitter
war to resist; is practically served In the
very government established as the re
sult of such resistance; that our fore
fathers denied an omnipotent Parliament
to decree an omnipotent .Congress: that
what- was: tyranny to them in 1765-78 is
less than tyranny now."
FTXLXER'S VOICE Iff AT DECIDE.
.'Mr.; AldHch closed with an elaborate
reference to the work of our forefathers,
Â¦which .â¢was not. for their day, but for all
time. As soon as he finished the court
turned to other cases, after: allowing
counsel in the Porto Rico case ten dayi
to file a further brief.
i WASHINGTON, Deo. 20.â In Congres-
Blonal circles the belief Is freely expressed
that at this stage the. Supreme Court
of the United-^ States is widely di
vided on the Porto Rican and Philippine
tariff cases, and that the decision will
ultimately be left to Chief Justice Ful
ler. Â¦ Thus the court would stand â¢ either
five to four or four to five on the Gov
ernment's contention.'
The administration professes to be very
confident that the decision will be in fa
vor- of the â¢ continuance of its policy. Its
followers in Congress, however, have had
their confidence rudely-shaken by the at
titude of Benjamin Harrison and Grover
Cleveland, both of whom have great
â¢weight with the, Supreme Court, and by
the fact that Attorney General Griggs,
during his argument on Wednesday, was
faced, with apparently hostile questions
by Justices Brewer, Harlan, . White and
Brown. , Â¦'r. l h&&kh*W 1 Q&0^KfrVfl*^M&l&M
It is recalled that President Harrison
appointed Justices Brewer, Shiras and
Brown - and \, President Cleveland ap
pointed Justices Fuller, White and Peck
ham. While no one expects that any of
theae. Judges Â¦ will be influenced, by.- the
opinions < entertained 'Â¦Â¦ by former Presi
dents it" Is nevertheless an interesting
fact , that the : friends, of the administra
tion,; who grasp at every straw Indicating
that Attorney , General Grlgrgs' contention
will be sustained, are pointing? out as sig
nificant the grouping of the Porto Rican
case and the 'Philippine case together. >
. This was â¢ done ' by Chief Justice Fuller
at , the .request' of the Attorney General
The Porto Rican case is not regarded as
a '.very strong one. whereas the 'Philippine
case gave I the Government I a great deal
of concern. : The friends : of the adminis
tration ' are \ now .; arguing .that the com
bination of ; these cases will rise . in the
decision in favor of the Â¦_ Government - on
the t general principle that the chain is
only Â¦ as ; strong :: as \ its ; . weakest tlink,-- and
in this - case ' the '.weak . link Is the Porto
Rican case. .

consideration - of., the payment of 20,000
taels. It is also said the Germans looted
many houses and rfhops. The expedition
was contrary to the understanding that
no measures of the kind were to be taken
pending, negotiations.
Much of the country is defenseless be
cause Chinese troopa are not allowed to
do anything. Foreign troops; are absent
or engaged in looting.
Field Marshal Count von Waldersee has

To-day it became known in Wall street
that Mr. Hill and his associates had ac
quired absolute control of the Northern
Pacific, a property formerly controlled by
Mr. Morgan and his associates. . It was
announced semi-ofnclally that there would
be a readjustment of Northern Pacific
Issues, and that probably the common
shares, as well as the preferred stock,
might be retired. , r *
Such a readjustment is . contemplated
enly that Mr. Hill mi^ht float In Europe,
among foreign ho'ders of the Great

Senator L/odge. who as a member of the
Committee on Foreign Relations has pi
loted the treaty through the Senate since
the death of Chairman Da\1Â», lost no
time In demanding that the voting begin
when 3 o'clock arrived. The Foreign Re
lations Committee amendments were read
first. Senator Lodge himself suggested a
verbal amendment to the first of these.

word "which," so as to make It read
"which ' convention Is hereby reversed.
He explained that "the suggestion had
b**n made that without the word it
might be construed &e appl\-ing only to
article VIII of the Clsytcn-Bulwer treaty,
whereas, he said, tt was intended to ap
ply to the entire treaty. Tne amendment
â¢wa* accepted " and the two committee
amendments were both accepted without

Senator Gallinger spoke in defense of
the treaty a* it originally came from the
executive. Senator Wolcott said that the
original treaty would have been satisfac
tory to him. but added that he considered
the agreement as it had been and was
about t<* be amended preferable to no

BY the platform adopted at Philadelphia-the Re
publican party declared last summer: "We favor
home rule for and the early admission to state
hood of the Territories of New Mexico, Arizona and
Oklahoma." In each of the Territories the people,
deem that an "early" admission should be admission
at once, and accordingly there is to-be a strong, effort
made to attain statehood as rapidly as the legal
processes can be carried through.
Of the three applicants Oklahoma has much the
best chance for eariy admission. A bill providing for
her admittance is now in the hands of the Senate
Committee on Territories, and as Senator Shoup of
Idaho, chairman of the committee, is known to be
favorable to the ambitions of that as well as of other
Western communities^ it is expected "the committee
will promptly report.' the measure and urge its adop
tion. -â -.'..Â¦..
The bill purposesjto make Oklahoma a State of con
siderable importance by extending her boundaries so
as to include Indian Territory. A double object is to
be served by the extension, for in addition to" aug
menting the domain and the population I of: the pro
posed new State.it will eliminate any question of the
later admission of Indian Territory as a separate State.
This feature of the bill has met with no little approval
in the , East, where the people seem to be indisposed
to admit any more Western Senators than they can
help.
- Oklahoma has good grounds upon which to claim
statehood.. Since its tands were opened to settlement
its growth and progress have been extraordinary even
in this country of marvelous developments: It has
now a population approaching 460,000, has built-up'
cities and towns and .laid the. foundations of diversi
fied industries from which much in the s way : of wealth
and prosperity can be assuredly looked .for. Neither '
Arizona nor New Mexico can make anything' like an
equal showing/and consequently the chances are they v
will have to wait some years after Oklahoma takes
her place as : the forty-sixth State -of the Union and,
has her star blazoned upon the national banner."'.
SEEKING STATEHOOD
WITH the rise of the holiday trade there has
risen in the larger cities of the East a renewed
demand for the establishment of a parcels post
system in this country similar to those operated with
so much benefit to the people in many European coun
tries. It will be remembered we have arranged for
a parcels post with several foreign nations, so that in
establishing the system for domestic use there would
be no radical innovation in ourpostoffice business.
There is now a parcels post bill before the Senate
which may possibly be taken up at this session. The
bill provides for the consolidation of the present third'
and fourth classes of mail matter, with free. delivery
in cities and in the country. where free delivery dis
tricts have been established. The rates fixed by thr
bill are: On parcels of one pound or less, 3 cents;
over one pound and not more than five, 5 cents; over
five pounds and not more than ten, 10 cents; over ten
pounds and not more than thirty, 30 cents; over thirty
pounds and up to sixty, 40 cents. The bill provides
that these rates shall be applied to bulk as well as to
weight, in the same proportion, under arrangements
to be made by the Postoffice Department. The post-
I age must be prepaid or the rate will be doubled; and
the charge includes house to house collection and de
livery wherever a wagon or car collection and deliv
j ery service has been or may be established. - In towns
j where there is only foot service the postman is not
required to carry any parcel weighing. more than five
pounds. :
Of course the advocates of the system are not
unanimous in favor of that particular, bill. It might"
; be amended and altered in minor details and still
1 prove satisfactory to the public demand. The essen
ftial-thing to be attained is to provide the people of
the United States with a safe, speedy and convenient
means of dispatching small parcels from one part of
the country to the other.
The lack of such a system imposes a heavy tax on
, every community. It is stated that in Great Britain
[nearly all sorts of purchases are sent home by mail.
In this country our merchants have to maintain a
costly system of delivery wagons, or submit to the
extortion of express companies. Persons living in theJ
suburbs out of reach of the delivery wagons are com
j pelled to take their purchases home by hand, and as
a consequence make their home journeys at the end of.
a day's work under conditions of great inconvenience.
The American people are past masters in the art
of labor saving machinery. They have devised means
and systems for economy of time and toil in almost all
directions. It is strange that in this respect
should have lagged behind Europe. It is something
I of a national reproach that our postaK administration
.should be less serviceable to the community than that
fof other nations not so! alert* as ourselves; in any re- 1
THE PARCELS POST BILL.
AMONG the Englishmen who have discussed the
Gayton-Bulwer treaty, and the attitude of our
Government in the isthmian canal affair, Sir
Charles Dilke has appeared as speaking with some
authority. He has visited the United States and in his
work. "Greater Britain," showed some study of our
institutions. Yet he says now that if President Mc-
Kinley stand firm his appeal to the people will un
doubtedly afford him support against the Senate and
nullify the attitude of that body!
This is very crass. It shows such familiarity with
the English system as to lead to the belief that ours
is like it, of course.
In England the executive, when defeated on a Gov
ernment measure in the House of Commons, may dis
solve Parliament and appeal to the people in an elec
tion. If the Government elect a majority in the new
Horse of Commons its policy, expressed in the con
tested measure, prevails. If defeated, the opposition
forms a new Ministry and takes the government.
Here there is no such process. We elect a new
House of Representatives every two years, but that
Joes not change the executive policy. For instance,
if the House to be elected in 1902 is for free trade
President Me Kinky, would not send in a message
?ss>enting to the repeal of the Dingley act. On the
othÂ«*r hand, he would veto a free trade measure ii
passed by the House and Senate.
This is one of the checks in our system which for
eigners find it so difficult to understand. Professor
Bryce in his "American Commonwealth" devoted
much space, very intelligently, to our system of checks
and balances provided to protect the country against
disastrous novelties and prevent a reversal of policy
by hzsty legislation. Each branch of our Congress
is a check upon the other. The Presidential veto is
a check-on both, and the Supreme Court is a final and
in&cpcndent check upon both the executive and legis>
lative branches.
The controversy over the canal treaty is in the Re
publican party. The President desires to abrogate
the Clayton- Bui wer treaty by substituting for it the
Hay-Pauncefote convention. Members of his party
adopt the ideas of the late Senator Davis, who was
chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, by im-r
porting into the treaty the principles of the treaty of
Constantinople under which the Suez canal was built.
In that treaty England secured a clause reserving the
right of Egypt to defend or fortify the canal. The
cases are not parallel, for Egypt is a vassal of Turkey
and the canal is in her territory. Nicaragua and
Costa Rica are not, our vassals, but are independent
sovereignties, and by the Davis amendment it is
sought, not to authorize them, but to empower us to
defend and monopolize the canal whenever our inter
ests may require it to be done. If we build the canal
tinder such principles it is probable that the Panama
project will be completed in order to secure a canal
that is absolutely neutral. The other commercial
powers have an interest* sufficiently large to justify
such a course. 1
During the campaign few people attached much im
portance to Senator Stewards return to the Republi
can party, but since the meeting of Congress every
body has discovered that it means a good- deal, for
there is now a fair assurance the Senate will not be
bored by another of those long-winded free silver
speeches he' has been in the habit of making.
Andrew. Jackson was not twins, but it looks now
as if the Democratic snnual feast in his honor would
show such a division between the Bryanites and the
conservatives as, to justify the conclusion that either
there were two of him or'else he led a double life.

Talk about reorganizing the Democratic party does
not trouble Bryan. He would just as soon make a
speech on that subject as any other, and his tongue
was not frozen when the frost struck him on election

J~) ETWEEN, the. members 'of .the New York Yacht
. j^j Club and certain yachting men of Boston there
has arisen a controversy concerning the
America's cup which promises "to raise a question of
interest to yachtsmen in- all parts of, the country.
Trie . New> York . 'Yacht . Qub â¢ holds the" America's
cup, and is Snow engaged in having 'constructed' a'
yrfcht-to defend it against Â¦ Sir Thomas /Lipton." At
the-same time a yachting man of Boston, Thomas W.
Lawson, has .announced a determination to- Â¦ build a
boat tb beat the New A'brk defender if he can. j It has
been the expectation ; that the New -York 'yacht and
that * of Boston Â¦ would ; have a trial race' and - that r the
winner would appear .as ' the ; American /champion
against the challenger, but there has arisen a prelim
inary point to be . settled which 'threatens to disturb
the whole arrangement. Â¦.'-;,â¢Â«Â¦
The New York men,' it appears, have become some
what jealousof Boston.and have? suspicions that the
intent' of the Bostonian is to get the cup out of the
hands of ; New York and take it to his own city. /Con
sequently it is said to have ; been "unofficially" an
nounced that unless Boston give an absolute guaran
tee that. no. attempt will be made, to get the trophy
transferred to the Eastern or some other Massachu
setts yacht club, in the event of the Lawson boat
bemg successful inthe .defense, the Boston 'craft will
not be allpwed. to compete in the trial ra^es.
It was supposed at one time there might be an easy
solution of the matter, by having; Mr. Lawson '< join
the New York Yacht Club, but he has refused to con
sider the proposition.. In a recent .dispatch â¢ from
Boston to the New York Mail arid Express Mr..Law
son is quoted as saying: ''After my name fiad been
put up for membership in the New York Yacht Club"
some friends of mine advised me to withdraw it, and I
did so. They had reason to believe that certain men
whose acquaintance I had made in Wall street had ex
pressed their opposition to my candidacy. I will not
apply a second time under any circumstances. The
fact is that since I have been considering the plan of
taking an active interest in the construction of a Bos
ton defender, some good friends of mine have asked
for permission to put my name up for membership
in the club. In the event of the Boston defende
being the .winning boat in the trial races I will "nave
the supr.eme management of her in the races with
Shamrock II without belonging to the New York
Yacht Club."
It will be seen the New' York men claim they have
control of the famous' cup against any American com
petitor whatever, and it is to be presumed they have
a right to make the claim upon the terms under
which the cup is held. Nevertheless, they would make
a mistake if they should insist upon that right, to the
exclusion of yachts from other American clubs ; iron,
the trial races. If Massachusetts or any other State
can build a better yacht than the New York men can
obtain, and if in. fair trial the New York .boat be
beaten, the winner should of right be the American
champion against the foreigner, and if successful
should have the cup.
The only value of the trophy is derived from being
the symbol: of victory in yacht- racing against all
comers, and if by technicality the right to compete
is denied to any yachting club or yachtsman, the cup ',
will no longer be a prize to'boa&t of. In the contest i
against the British challenger America should put hex* '
best host in the race, and if that happen to be a Bos- ]
ton instead of a New York boat let Boston have the
trophy. Next time New York might have better '

What Would Wesley SayP
What would John Wesley, who preached
that "cleanliness is Indeed next to godli
ness." say to the Pittsburg magistrate
who yesterday committed a tramp named;
Worth for possessing himself of a cako
of soep? Tre culprit removedâ we really
can't write "stole"â the soap from tho
washroom of a police station in which ha
had lodged over night. It's altogether a
mysterious caseâ strange that a station
house should be selected as the theater
of such an exploit, stranger that Pitts
burg policemen should have soap In thetr
possession, strangest of all that a tramp
should thus lay hands upon the thing ab
horred of bis tribe.â NEW YORK HER

Bough, on Tramps.
The Supreme Court of Ohio has Â¦ ex
amined the State's new anti-tramp law
and does not find anything unconstitu
tional in it. This law Is certainly a terÂ«
ror to tramps. It says that any-- person
of the male sex. not afflicted with blind
ness, not a resident of the country, who la
"found going about begging," shall ba
deemed a tramp. Then it saya further:
"Any tramp who enter3 a dwelling-house
or yard or lnclosure about a dwelling
house, against the will or without the per
mission of the owner or occupant thereof,
or does not, when requested, immediate
ly leave such place, shall be imprisoned
not more than three nor less than one
year." It was the fortune of one Tim
othy Hogan to furnish the test case and
achieve fame at the cost of the incar
ceration.-HARTFORD COURANT.
The Real American.
In these days of growing trade relations
between the two countries, when Eng
lishmen find it to their interest to in
vest so much of their capital in American
Industries, would not writers and corre
spondents do well to portray the real
America and show how. In spite of Its
youthful love of grotesque fun. its so
cial, political and commercial life la re
sponsive to what is best and most endur
ing In the civilization of the Old World?
Were they to do this they would at first
doubtless disappoint those who tfcinfc
America a nation of minstrel "end men."
but in the end they would earn the grati
tude of all who believe that the pro
gress and prosperity of the world are besf
promoted by nations and men coming fo>
know one another as - they are.â NEW

Passion for Revenge.
While our envoys at Peking are ne
gotiating with the authorized represen
tatives of China, why should Germany,
for instance, send a few regiments fifty or
a hundred miles from Peking to burn vil
lages on the slender pretext that certain
Christians must be protected, who were
not in any immediate danger? These ex
peditions are unwarranted. They have
their origin in a passion for revenge
which neither the present nor the future
can excuse. They make a. settlement
more difficult to reach; they exasperate
the Chinese, who are already in despair,
and they are productive of no good ttÂ» any
one. If we are really civilised let us give
proof of It in a policy which will not ex
cite the abhorrence of even the poor
"heathen Chinee."â NEW YORK HER*

Our Stay in Cuba.
What Is the value of the phrase* ahotj*
Cuba having been pacified and a stable
government having been established?
Very little. Suppose we were to evacuate
Cuba and disorders were to break out?
In that case would it not have beeii
shown that the island really had not been*
pacified and should we not be responsible
under the treaty for the consequences of
such disorder? Or. suppose that %Â»e left
the Island after having supervised the In
stitution of what we supposed to be a
stable government and that, a revolution
subsequently occurred as a result of which.
lives were lost and property destroyed
Would it not have been shown that the
government had not been stable and that
our evacuation had been premature? Tha
fact is that our obligations with regard
to the government of Cuba are of Inde
terminate duration. â PHILADELPHIA*

spect, and it is therefore not surprising there is a con;
tinued agitation for improvement.' -
Great as is.the popular demand for the parcels post,
it is not to be. gained easily. There is a strong an
tagonist in the way. . As the New York Press recently
said: "When the public turns to Congress for. relief
it will find that its 'relief hay been withheld by theMn
fluence of .the same railroad companies which, now
seek to blackmail it with bundle regulations into
patronizing their express cars." So Jong as the ex
press companies and their allies of the railroads can
control . Congress we -may have all the parcels post
conveniences 'with foreign countries we choose,, but
we can have none at home. The improvement .'can
be brought about only by '.united effort .of ; the people,
and now that the East has taken up the fight the West
should cordially co-operate.
THE ex-President's recent brief interview in the.
Atlanta Journal had no further effect than to
call out some, sneers and abuse from the .'pres
ent Democratic leaders.. They seem contented with
the situation, and show no signs of intending to ad
mit that their Populistic experiment is a failure. Not
heeding the ill-success of his first essay- at' advising,
his late party, Mr. Cleveland has discussed the sub
ject of Democratic rehabilitation at great length in the
Philadelpfiia Post. His case is stated with his usual
frankness and clearness, but as those traits -in him
were the original cause of offense to his party, there
is no present reason for believing that it will take
another display of them with patience, or even polite
ness. The group of men who succeeded him and his
last Cabinet in the party leadership are firmly deter
mined not to let go, and the country is^conteht. that
they shall hold on, since it is evident that their per
sistence means continued Republican supremacy. /
There is no sign in sight that the new Democracy
is going to shed its novel garments and rehabilitate,
by crawling into its old clothes, as Mr. Cleveland
advises. After many struggles and a long existence
it seems fated to go the way of the Federal and'Whig'
parties, leaving its ruins to be quarried in by men in
j search of material to form an organized â¢.'opposition
to Republicanism. If it dodge this fate, and continue
its existence, it will take up other novelties besids
which those complained of by Mr. Cleveland will seem
conservative and commonplace. In 1893, when Bryan
and Maguire in the House and White and Vest in the
Senate reached the parting of the ways on the silver
question, it was said that the course of those gentle
men led directly into Populism, and that if the party
followed them it would arrive in due time* 1 and stand
Qn the Ocala platform. If it refused to follow them,
then, it was said, they would have to about face or go
on until they personally landed -in Populism. That
was at a time when but few foresaw what happened
three years later. The party faced and marched
toward Populism, has fought and lost two campaigns
under that banner. It will not turn back. It has
already plunged into state socialism and communism,
ani will undoubtedly soon take its place with the great
socialist and communist parties "of France and Ger-',
many. ".';'â¢'-â¢â¢ Â¦ -> â¢
Governor Altgeld is an advanced communist, and
his somber genius is the real inspiration of the party
which Mr. Cleveland vainly calls' back to Rag Fair,
to redeem its old clothes.
Radicalism of policy and epithet in advocating it
have a charm for weak minds that is irresistible (b the
leading spirits of the party. Appeals to prejudice are
so much easier to make than appeals to reason that
the slothful in intellect and the violent in temper pre
fer them. They cannot reason, therefore they froth
and call hard names.
The Republican party has attracted to it those who
know reason from prejudice and argument from epi
theti When the socialist seed now planted in Democ
racy shall sprout and be watered and watched and
tended by those who believe that society must be re
constructed on the foundation of its diseases and fail
ures, and that its health and success are crimes to be
punished, what reason is left in the party will depart
; and go over to Republicanism, meeting on the way
a few who follow unreason into Democracy.
Mr. Cleveland and the few who agree with him
will be like Jo Davicss of Kentucky, who tried in
vain for years to breathe a living soiil into the
dead body of Federalism, and, failing, never cast
another vote, and lived as a recluse from politics.
The hopelessness of Mr.'. Cleveland's plan will fbe
presently made apparent by the abuse that will roar
around him, coming from his former associates.
Thoughtful men in the country, even Republicans, will
respect his motives-and sympathize with his desire to
re-create a constitutional opposition party that will
not march under a skull and crossbones', but, being
thoughtful, they will foresee the failure that is sura
to come. Altgeld, Tillman, Jones and Stone will still
tramp around in a circle, getting nowhere, ranting
and scolding, calling hard names and throwing mud,
leading a Bedlam and calling it a party; and
Cleveland, Carfisle and Buckner and their followers
will be like the non-jurors who refused to swear alle
giance to William III, a sorrowful sect, decreasing
and finally dying out.

"While the Turk3 have beea united by
the tiÂ« cf rellgicn. the subject of Chr!Â»
tiaas have been divided by the very force
which has Inspired thea to throw off this
alien swayâ the principle of nationality,
for being made up of several nationalities.
Jealous of each other, the force of their
resistance has beea greatly diailaizhed by
mutual antagonism.
The sense of nationality Is a natural
outgrowth of modem democracy. If the
people have the right to rule theiaselves.
It is but a step to the feeling that all the
people who. through the inheritance cf a
cosuaoa Language aad a common range of
idea3. are conscious cf a renl naity cf life
are entitled to fem a political union aad
to play their part la the world's history
bl3 one nation. The de*penin? conscious
ness of this essential cnioa of Interests cr
the feeling of rationality has been one of
the moat powerful political forces of the
century, and has played havoc with tradi
tional political > combinations, promoting.
on the one hand, great national unions
like the German empire aad the kin^em
of Italy, and. ca the ether hand, strain-
Ing to the uttermost the ties cf cnioa ia
a composite state like Austria-Hungary,
or disrupting into several feeble frag
ments a dominion like that of the Turks.
It was'the strength of the feeling of na
tionality In the North that defeated
Southern seeessicn. It separated Holland
and Belgium ta 1330. and it has Ion?
threatened to separate Norway frcn
Sweden. It attaches Canada and Austra
lia to England and makes the Irish dreaai
of separation from England. It demanded
and resented the cession of Alsace-Lor
raine- It Inspired the Boers to resist Eng
land and the Filipinos to resist the United
States. But the Influence of the feeling
ci nationality has been nowhere stronger
than la old "Turkey In E-art>pe.~ where it
has brought Into existence the cew ca
tions of Greece, Rosmania. Servta and
Bulgaria, and given Russia an Inuaense
advantage over other European states la
I shaping tbeir destinies.
I If there had beea but one nationality la
I the regions ruled by Turkey the Turks
would haTe been driven Into Asia long
ago.
In the lnaxtrlcable mixtare cf races tn
European Turkey the lines cf nationality
could not be drawn la accordance with
historical origin, therefore unity of lan
guage, aa Is apt to be the ease, became
the determining factor. F"cr all practical
purposes this is the natural criterion of
nationality, for it. Is the possession of a
ccumacn language which endows a people
in the process of time with such a com
mon inheritance of ide&s and aspirations
that they feel they are one. and cakes a
cation out of the mest diverse elements.
In the working out of this principle ia
this case cne important exception !s to be
noticed. la Turkey a portion of each, his
torical nationality has beea converted to
Mohammedanism, and the tie of religion
proving stronger thaa that of language
the Turks as a ruling caste . are to be
thought of as consisting not onlx of peo
ple historically of Turkish origin bat also
of Greeks. Albanians, Servians. Bulgar
ians and Roumanians, who. being Moham
medans, were to all Intents and purposes
Turks. Conversely the terms Greeks. Bul
garians, etc, mean the Christian portions,
resptctlTely, of the populations speaklsg
Greek cr Bulgarian.
Although ta general the feeling cf na
tionality ta the Balkan states <the cost
men came to-day for what used to be the
major ran of Turkey In - Europe) has
worked as a force of mutual repulsion, in
one aspect Its tnfiaence has beea power
ful In the direction of a kicd of unios,
the uaioa of cemmea subjectioa to Rus
sian Influence, and tdtimately, perhaps, of
common absorption by Russia. Most of
the Christians cf these natiot^!!3es be
long to the Greek church, which la the
estabUsfced charta cf Russia, aad this *?Â»Â«
made Russia tbeir natural protector and
constituted a certain oneness of interest
between tiers. This, reinforced by the
fact that the Servians and Bulgarians
like tlie Rttssians. speak Slavic languages
not more dissimilar to each other than
are Italian. Spanish and Portuguese. M^
made the Slavic peoples of the - Balkan
peninsula, more or less susceptible to th*
in&uence of Pan-Slavism, or that partic
ular phasa of the principle of nationality
which looks to the onioa of an Slavs en
der the wing of Russia.
Under these conditions there have arisen
In the present century from the - old Tur
key ia Europe the Independent Â» kingdoms
of Greece, Roumanla and SerVia. the in
dependent principality of Montenegro the
principality of Bulgaria, which pays a
tribute â¢ to . the â¢ Sultan, and the province*
of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which bear
the earns relation to Austria tÂ»jnt C&t*.
Servians ha-r* sot been gr&tifiad by thÂ»
union of all SÂ«rrtass t^:hÂ« ktn^dca, zsr
seine stm are subject to Turkey, tha Ser
vians of Moa:ece?rt> are under a ruler
of their own. and rr.es* cÂ£ Bosnia ani
Heixe&cmlna. are rule*! by AtBtria.
BuljarU. ts stffi fci thÂ« posittca ot a.
tribute-paying state to Turkey, aad xhm
limits of E^IffarJa. like those of Greece,
are narrower than thÂ» distribution cf tha
B3!jarlaja. It was tiie ortarirat desiss cf
Russia after the war wti-s Turkey la 1S7T
to establish a jrea; Balgarian state to
comprise aU the territory mainly Inhab
ited by Bulgarians, and ts sui iiil in ilac*
donla.-wtuoÂ»e populartos Is very varied.
Feartay the predenoinance cf Russia, tha
western powers remanded Hacedcnia to
Turkish rule and divided Bulgaria. Into
two partsâ one to be called Bulgaria, and
to be independent except for the payment
cf tribute; the other to be called Eastern
Rounselia. and to &e under an adntinistra
tloa In which thÂ» Sultan was represented.
Like many another arrangensent of tits
kind, this lasted enly tentpcrarily. la
ISS3 the strength cf the feeling for union
was 3uch that the two separated sectians
of the Bulgarian people united la sp!tÂ« ot
the disr'easure cf Russia, as wsll as Tur
key. For It has been the policy of Rus
sia that advantages to these
states oust ccce through her cr cot at
alL
Rocise!Ia>â cr rather Its eonstitrsent de
mentsâthe old provinces of Waiiachi3
and Moldaviaâ had never been so overrun
by the Turks as the other states wh&sa
history we have lust reviewed. ThesÂ«
provinces had been in a position as re
gards^ TcrS-y cot so very diastntilar ta
that of Bsilgaria to-day, except that their
rulers were appointed by the Sultan. Af
ter the Crimean war the two provinces
were placed under the protection at tha
powers and constituted a dual stats,
called the United Principalities. They had
the right to elect their two rulers. They
ingeniously effected a union by eJectia^
the sazne oaa. The complete independence
of Rouznanla was obtaind by the ?r&r
with Turkey in 1ST7, and the #^1 reccsat
tiea as a kinsrdoca by all the powers tn
I3S1. Tet again, as tn^the ease of Greece
and Servta. Roumaaia does not Include all
the Roumanians.
Thus tha feeling cf naSoaallty after
Qu*ckenlny these people into new liTe aad
stimulating tbvem to obtain tsdepesdence
has been temporarily blocked ta its wori-
Iny out. Fcr this reason nobody la ths
Balkan peninsula and the ceighberhoed ts

The preliminary fights were between
Attell and Bozeman, and Kelly and Flynn.
Abe Attell's first professional fight was a
victory. After ten rounds of hard fight
ing Attell was proclaimed the victor over
Jockey Bozeman. While the fight was
close enough for the crowd to hang upon
the referee's decision for a clew, the great
majority of the spectators were of the
opinion that Referee Jack Welch knew his
business when he pointed to Atteil as the
winner. The leading wa& primarily the
work of Attell, who offset the superior
strength of Bozeman by an exercise of a
mild sort of rleverness.
The second fight was between Doc
Flynn and Suider Kelly.

"Glad to see you," said Flynn.
"Don't hit me," said the Doc.

In the fourth round Ed Bowen, repre

Some of the spectators wanted the lights
to go out. In the seventh round Doc
Flynn was caressed on the jaw and went
down. He got up before the call of time,
and received a few more affectionate taps
from the "Spider." Two rounds later
some more affectionate fistic demonstra
tions were administered by Kelly, and
Flynn almost succeeded in going out. At
the end of this round Referee Welch
stopped the fiasco and called it no con
test.
The referee said: "Flynn never was
anything but a faker. Kelly is a 'hua

Customs Collector Stratton and Federal
Quarantine Officer Dr. Kinyoun had an
interview yesterday with reference to the
doctor's method of enforcing the Federal
Quarantine regulations and the dissatis
faction which seemc to prevail among the
members of the mercantile community.
Mr. Stratton declined to say anything
for publication beyond that "a report
would be sent to Washington â¢ con
cerning the doctor's administration and
unpopularity," and that "something was
doing" in the matter. From the tone in
which Mr. Stratton spoke It was- evident
that the "something" that "was doing"
was of a decisive nature.
With reference to the interview between
Mmself and r>r. Kinyoun he said that the
doctor had shown him telegrams and
ether papers tending to prove that all the
doctor's orders with reference to quaran
tine had been issued in accordance with
instructions leceived from Washington.
It was understood on the outside that a
Ftrcng protest agpinst Dr. Kinyoun re

Collector a few days ago. and that the
investlgation instituted by the Collector
was the result of instructions issued by
the Secretary of the Treasury.

COLLECTOR STBATTON
OTTO CRIBB, fresh from Australia,
and rated as an able pugilist In
his own country, earned his Amer
ican fistic spurs last night by
knocking out Frank McConnell in
the fourth round of a fast figrht. Crlbb
proved himself a fighter, and by merit
of his performance against McConnell is
entitled to a match with welterweights
who have fame and reputation.
Once again the San Francisco ring pub
lic prejudged a new man In its old famil
iar way. McConnell was a 2 to 1 favorite
over the Australian, simply because he
was known â¢ to the public and his antag
onist was a stranger. Cribb is a fast
fighter, relentless and full of determina
tion. He has the Australian method of
defense, body well in and shoulders as a
guard to his headpiece. He will take a
blow and smile. At long range he is awk
ward. Close In his speed and swift, short
jolty blows make him a dangerous and
much-to-be-feared pugilist.
When the gong sounds , Cribb went at
McConnell as if a knockout were his only
desire on earth. Boring Into the local
.men he cut out a pace so fast that it
flus-tered McConnell for a time, and gave
the crowd an Inkling of how the light
would terminate. But McConnell collected
his wite and by long-range fighting- kept
Cribb away from him. SUIT lefts by Mc-
Connell and steady, consistent, boring
tactics by Cribb was the story of the first
round.
Then the fight simmered a bit, but not
enough to lose any of its snappy quality.
The second round was a steadier one for
McConnell. who played a long range fira
at Cribb, while the last named waited for
a chance to use his deadly short-arm
Jolts. In the third round Cribb was at
McConnell all the time, the San Francis
can cleverly ducking and avoiding pun
ishment by clever foot work.
After that came the sudden wind-up.
At the outset of the fourth Cribb made a
rush at McConnell, who went to the
ropes. At the breakaway McConnell for
got himself and tried the Australian's
strongest tactics. In-fighting. At close
range both men rained blow after blow
upon each other. Across the ring they
fought until Cribb landed a stiff left Jolt
on McConnell's jaw, then a right followed
by a left- It was all over. McConnell
dropped on his back, and Referee 'Jack
Welch counted him out.
Cribb's performance last night was va
riously rated by ring-goers. To many he
seemed to have the stuff in him that
makes champions; to others he appeared
only as a good middle-rater. Whatever Is
said of him, that he is a fighter pure and
simple is not to be denied. He mixes
matters from the Jump, Is not afraid of a

men was dispatched north yesterday even
ing.
AMSTERDAM, Dec. 20.â Mr. Kruger at

respondent. "Is seething with anti-British
excitement. A recrudescence of rebellion
is perceptible in the district immediately
south of the Orange River. Tuesday

lippstown, presumably with a commando
which crossed at Sand Drift."

oOO to 800, hasicrossed the Orange River at
Rhenoster, Hoek.
"A second band is reported to have
crossed near Sand Drift. They have been
followed. I have sent a considerable body
of mounted men, who are getting around
them.
Considerable activity is now manifested
at Aldershot. A large draft of 'mounted
troops. will be ready to start for South Af
rica January 6, while others have been no
tified to hold themselves in readiness for
the came destination.
According to the Cape Town correspond

the treason court sitting in Colesburg
was obliged hurriedly to remove to Cape
Town with the records and documents
owing to the vicinity or the invading
Boers. Â¦Â¦:-> -.'.. v'a- ' Â¦

Almost to the day of his death Mr. Foor
man took an active interest in the politi
cal interests of his adopted country. At
the last Presidential election he insisted
upon being permitted to leave his sick
room and was driven to the polls, where
he cast his voteâ a straight Republican
one. The heroic act of the old gentleman
received a complimentary little notice In
the columns of The Call, and the article
was forwarded by Congressman Julius
Kahn to the President. This article
brought forth a charming little note from
the President to Mr. Foorman thanking
him for his interest in the Republican
party.
Deceased was an extremely charitable
man, and many poor and needy will
mourn his loss. He was one of the foun
ders of the Eureka Benevolent Associa
tion and a member of the Pacific Lodge,
San Francisco Chapter of Masons, and
also of the Concordia Club.
The funeral of the. aged philanthropist
will be held Sunday morning from his
late residence on California street. The
interment will take place in the Home of
Peace Cemetery.

man, who, for forty-two years has been
a devoted wife, and their only son, Isaac

Mr. Foorman was born in Diefenthal,
Hessen. Germany, November 15, 1818. He
came to the United States in 1S47 and

short, and early in 1S50 he Joined the
goldseekers and Journeyed across the
plains.
In August. 1S50, Mr. Foorman settled on
Mokelumne Hill, Calaveras County, and
became prominently identified with the
mining interests of that section. He was
one of the incorporators of the Mokel

through the uncleared timber they un
wisely turned aside from the path to
gather holly berries. When they tried to
retrace their eteps they failed to find the
path. While they stumbled about in the
gathering gloom they found something
tney were not looking for, and that was a
big black bear. ( . v ~'*'
As they turned to run they found an
other bear behind them. Almost faint
ing with terror, they fled over stumps and
fallen trees, f past great boulders and
through .thick brush, for off the trail the
country about Maple Ridge Is very wild.
The bears pursued them for an hour, but
finally desisted, and the frightened chil
dren sought shelter from the pouring rain
In a hollow tree. There they remained dur
ing the night and all the following day,
venturing out only to pluck a few winter
berries. The storm increased In intensity,
and all through Wednesday the tired, wet,
cold and hungry girls remained prisoners,
not daring to leave their shelter. It was
early on Thursday morning before thev
were found by the rescuing party which
had been searching for them more than
thirty hours. One of the bears was shot
forty yards from their hiding place by
Helen Blayney's father, and the other
bear made off into the woods.
MRS. MANNING SAYS
HER HUSBAND KICKED Hp.H
Wife of Former Pugilist Complains
of Brutal Treatment, but Fails
to Appear in Court.
LOS ANGELES. Dec 20.â Professor
Billy Manning, ex-pugilist, but now a
"professor of physical culture," was to
have been tried before Justice Austin this
morning, on a charge t>t battery on â¢ his
last wife, but only the physlclaji's testi
mony was taken and the hearing was con
tinued until Monday. The complaining
witness was Â¦ not on hand nor was the
"professor," but these informalities were
waived, and as the doctor did not want to
have another day spoiled his testimony
was taken. â¢
As near as can be ascertained the last
Mrs, Manning had roused the ire of her
lord and master and he disciplined her.
Mr. Manning believes in vigorous meas
ures, and while the professor declares that
he used no more force than was absolute
ly necessary under the circumstances Mrs.
Manning declares she was almost killed.
Not only was she knocked down several
times, she declares, but while she waa
lying prostrate on the fioor and could not
defend herself her husband repeatedly
kicked her in the abdomen and groin and
but for the fact that she was fully dressed
and had on her stays she thinks she
would have- been killed. . .
The row took place at the Manning
mansion on Pico street. The physician
testified that he met Mrs. Manning at the
elevator in the Currier block when <she
was looking for a phvsldan. He took
her to his office and made an examina
tion, finding numerous bruises on the
body which might have been made by the
vigorous application of a heavy boot or
shoe. One bruise on the. groin was.es
pecially severe.

threatened to sell the stock In a lump and
Murphy alleged this would be to his tletri

William White, Charged Â¦With Steal
ing a Horse in West Riverside,
Captured in Los Angeles.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 20.â A man who
for two years has succeeded in evading
the officers of the law was arrested in this
city this morning and sent back to an
swer for his crime in Riverside County in
1898 W. White stole a horse and buggy
at South Riverside. He was well known
in that â¢ county and before the news of
the theft became public White went to a
Â¦well-known rancher and contracted for
$300 worth,. of turkeys, which he was to
bring to Los Angeles and sell and remit
the money to the rancher. He got his
turkeys and dropped out of sight as com
pletely as if the earth had swallowed him.
A reward was offered for the capture of
White and Sheriff Coburn of Riverside
County has been looking for the man ever
since, covering several hundred miles in
his search, but without success.
Several days ago Detective Elms of this
city got a tip that the man was in Los
Angeles. He finally located his man at
307 East Seventh street, where he was liv
ing with his wife and child and conducted
a sort of junk and repair shop under the
name of William Black,* having reversed
the color of his name. Elms had taken
the precaution to .have all the papers
made out and this morning he and Sheriff
Coburn went to White's place. The man
was sweeping the sidewalk and as soon as
Coburn saw nlm he knew he was the one
he was after.
After his arrest White admitted that he
was the man wanted. Before leaving with
the officers White turned over his pocket
book to his wife and gave her Instructions
about closing up the business, saying that
he did not know when he would be back.

For a time she stopped at the St. James

They sympathized with her and won their
way into her good graces. ';

use that and wanted to borrow some
money. Mrs. Prettyman gave him }2oO.
In the next few days, according to her
statements, he got $330 at different time*.
Saturday he applied for more money. He
i,aid he wanted to rent the premises of
the bakery and by paying a year in ad

ding was solemnized at the residence of
Mrs. George Headen, near Gilroy, yester
day_morning, when her daughter. Miss
Lola Headen, was united in marriage to
Jesse J. Inman of San Jose. Rev. Mr. In
nes of the Methodist Episcopal church
performed the ceremony, which waa fol
lowed by a wedding breakfast.
Wedded at Gilroy.
Verein Hall to-night. Several hundred
couples were present. The errand march
was led by Chief of Police Kidward an.l
his daughter, Miss Carrie Kidward. Re
ceipts from the ball go Into the treasury
of the Policemen's Benefit Association.
"Max, I want to draw your attention
to certain things," said Manager Leahy
to the director, and proceeded to tell .him
of the errors made by some of the com
pany and also by the stage hands, which
the manager thought Hirschfeld was re
sponsible for.
The musical director refused to admit
that he was responsible for the errors
noted by Manager Leahy., and with a
sweep of his hand said:
"I am the musical director here and it
is for me to note any errors in the per
formance. I do not want you to tell me
my business, and if you don't like the
way I do things you can get another
leader."
"See here, Hirschfeld," said Leahy, "I
am tired of your constant bluffs to quit
us every time anything is pointed out to
you, and this time your bluff Is called.
You can leave the theater for good and
we will have a leader who does not think
that he Is the whole show."
Arrangements were at once made to re
place Hirschfeld by William Robinson,
who led the orchestra for the nrat time
last evening.
The new leader of the Tivoli was born
in London and was a pupil of the late Sir
Arthur Sullivan at the Royal Academy of
Music in London. For eight years he was
musical director for D'Oyly Carte, the
original producer of all the Gilbert and
Sullivan operas. Mr. Robinson came to
America with Lydia Thompson some
years ago and has been director of or
chestra for the Castle Square companies
in New York and Chicago. He succeeded
Director Slmonson with the Southwell
Company and recently wielded the baton
for "Ship Ahoy," when Ferris Hartman
starred in that play.
MANY comments were made last
evening by the patrons of the
Tivoli at the presence in the
director's chair of William Rob
inson, who made so favorable
an impression when he led the orchestra
of the Southwell Opera Company last sea
son. ' ;
The fact that Max Hirschfeld did not
conduct the performance of "Cinderella"
and that his name was ' eliminated from
the programme gave rise to many rumors,
for it has always been thought that the
Teutonic leader was a "fixture" at the
popular theater on Eddy str-;-et.

E. E. Wai den of Phoenix Falls Into
Trap Set for Him by
Inspectors.
PHOENIX, Ariz., Dec. 20.â E. E. Wal
den. a letter-carrier of the Phoenix post
<;Sice, was arrested to-day for taking,
concealing- and embezzling a letter con
taining valuables, the arrest being made
et the instance of Postofflce Inspector N.
B. Hall.
For a long time crooked work has been
going on, presumably in this postoffice,
end many valuable letters have been
missed. Some time ago $200 disappeared
mysteriously from the money-order de
partment during the momentary absence
of the money-order clerk. Of a force of
eome ten or fifteen employes suspicion
rested on Walden and a trap was laid for
him. A decoy letter was fixed up con
taining two silver dollars and bearing the
Omaha postmark. It was addressed to
Flng Wo and bore a? well Chinese charac
ters on the envelope. The letter was
placed in Walden' s delivery pouch.
When he came in from his rounds he
prepared to leave the office, checking him
telf out by the clocklike machine for that
purpose. Inspector Hall met him at the
door and aeked him for the letter ad
dressed to Sing Wo. He drew it from his
pocket, paying he paw It had money in it
and put It there for safe keeping. He Is
a married man. and his rapid life first
fcxoused suspicion against him.

VANXOLTVER. Dec. 20.â It was a sad I
story of useless sacrifice and misplaced j
devotion to duty that was brought to
night by the survivors ' of the Â¦wrecked
steamer Alpha, who arrived on the Gov
ernment steamer t.'uadra. The nine lives
lost might all have been saved, according
to their shipmates, but there was no In- ,
surance on the Alpha and the managing j
owner, Sam Barber, who was on board,!
was only a minor shareholder in the ,ves- â¢
sel, and to preserve the unprotected Inter- I
ests'of his associates he made a mad at- |
tempt to ri>;ht the doomed ship.
With the sa..pper. Captain Vork. and his
brother, â¢ Purser Barber, Sam Barber anrt
six volunteers from the crew refused to
follow their shipmates aiongr the lines to
safety, but remained on the wrecK. The
survivors say it was pitiful to see the-r
futile efforts. The Alpna was high on the
rocks, but the higher waxes broke over
her constantly, and through her bottom
the cargo flowed out as the sea flowed .n,
and yet the unfortunate nine deliberate
ly remained on the doomed vessel until It
was too late.
Chief Otticer Wilkinson says the wreck
was not due to the Alpha's punning in the
darkness on the rocky reef known as Yel
low Island.- On the contrary the skipper
knew his location perfectly, although
there was a fearful gale and the darkness
was Inky.
The trouble was that the Alpha failed
to respond to her helm, her steering gear
having become tangled. They were per
fectly helpless to avert the doom which
they knew was inevitable. They could
do nothing but await the completion of
the disaster. s
It Is said here to-day that It was part of
tha Alpha's recognized hoodoo that It
was not until the day after the details of
the wreck were known that Special
Treasury Agent Link should arrive here
from Washington to arrange terms with
the owners as to the penalty to be Im
posed for her unauthorized trip to Nome
last season. It was fear of being confis
cated for that episode which Induced her
owners to charter the Alpha for Japan
on her last and fatal trip.

But a Poor Medicine.
Common soda is all right in Its place
and indispenslble in the kitchen and for
cooking and washing purposes, but soda
waa never Intended for medicine, and peo-
ple who use it as such will some day-
regret it. Â¦.""Â¦â¢ ;Â¦â¢- --Â¦'- '-
The common use of soda to relieve heart-
burn and sour stomach is a habit -which
thousands of people practice almost dally,
and one which Is fraught with danger.
Soda gives only temporary relief, and In
the end the stomach trouble gets worse
and worse.
The soda acts as a mechanical Irritant
to the walls of the stomach and bowels,
and cases are on record where It accumu-
lates in the intestines, causing death by
Inflammation or peritonitis.
Dr. Harlandson recommends as the
ealest and surest cure for sour stomach
(acid dyspepsia) the dally use after meaU
of an excellent preparation, sold by
druggists under', the name of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets. These tablets are i
large 20-grain lozenges, pleasant to thÂ«
taste and containing natural peptones '
and digestive elements necessary to good i
digestion, and which all weak stomachs
a stuart'B Dyspepsia Tablets used regu-
larly after meals digest the food prompt- i
ly and thoroughly before It has time to
ferment, sour and poison the blood and
nervous system. .
Dr. Wuerth states that he Invariably
uses and recommends Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets in all forms of stomach derange-
ment, and finds them a certain cure not
only 'or sour stomach, but by causing
prompt digestion of the food they create
a healthy appetite, Increase flesh and
strengthen the action of the heart and
They are not a cathartic and contain no
violent drug, but are intended only for
stomach diseases and faulty digestion, and
generally acknowledged to be the most
reliable cure for any stomach trouble
except cancer of the stomach.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets now enjoy
an International reputation and popular-
ity, and are sold by druggists everywhere
In the United States. Canada and Qreat
Britain. ' '

"At times the market has shown reactionary

eral weakness has developed and none la yet
In eight. Blocks are not In weak hands; as
yet there has been no excessive or reckless
speculation, and while general business con
tinues so sound and actlvÂ« there is little chance
tor ccare reaction*. Some uneaainesa has been
felt regarding the money market, for higher
rates are anticipated with preparations for
January disbursement* and in view of the
present condition of bank reserves. Any such
â¢tringency. however. Is likely to be temporary,
and while time money continue* to be obtain
able on moderate terms holders of Etocks are
not likely to show much anxiety. The dis
bursements on dividend and interest account
next January will be unusually heavy; In fact
th*y must break the record, for the Industrials
are distributing heavy amounts Â«f prÂ«tit!= an<i
many cf the railroads have either Increased
their dividend rate or entered the ranks 01
dividend payers. Therj is every rrospect of
a. h:g investment dema>.d for stocks and bonds
Â«Surinp the next few weeks and this in Eplte
of high prices.
"The course of the market, more especially
u-lthin the past fortnight, has demonstrated
the stability cf actual conditions throughout
the country. Fears M-ere expressed that the
November rise In values was In excess of
warrant, but it Is becocxlng clearer every day
that the investing public has examined Into

Nrj) K York Stock Market.
XEW YORK, Dec 2ft.â The stock market to
day -AiA not vary materially In character from
that which has prevailed for many days.
Prnftt-taklnjr was palpably on an enormous
rcale and was not without effect on prices, but
the Inroads made were not serious and the
offerir^s were easily absorbed, while this par
tial weakness in the market did not In the
least impair the eager rush to buy stocks
which showed any disposition to advance. The
day ended with the market more generally
reactionary than for some time past, under
a flood of eelllnB to take profits In Northern
Pacific and other stock* which had shown the
meat aggressive strength during the day. The
rush to sell Northern Pacific waa caused by
the publication In a news bureau bulletin of
the statement that Â«. plan had been perfected
for the voluntary retirement of the preferred
vtock in January by exchange for general Hen
3 pÂ«r cents. This statement was not vouched
for by official authority, but It caused
a eudiJen drop la Northern Pacific to
M% the price having touched 86%, or
C% points over last nlKht. This movement In
Northern Pacific was tlie main feature of the
iTiarket, but there were various other Important
movements which seemed to have relation to
it. Including the Wluconsln Central stocks.
Pere Marquette stocks, the Erie stocks and
gt Paul. The Â«tre*t wu full of rumors of
pl&ns for combination* looking to a new trans
continental line and to the concentration of
Interests in Northwestern territory- The pains
in the groups mentioned extended all the way
frorr 2 pointa up to 3% in Northern Pacific
There man. besides, a vigorous upward move
ment in Mitsouri Pacific, which carried it 4%
points over last night and caused a revival
of many old rumors Â«f plans for extensive
ccnBoiidation among th# Gould Southwestern
railroad companies. A rUe In Union Pacific
to 78 seemed to bÂ« Â«lue to an attempt to ad
juct the discrepancy in value between that
stock and Northern Pacific. Illinois Central
rose buoyantly in the morning: 3% per cent on
a belated demand to secure the rights of sub
scription at par to the proposed new stock
iÂ«su<? which are limited to stockholders of
record to-day. Bugar wu the one feature
aroonr the â¢pecialtles with a rise of 2%. which
â¢no* attributed to a turn against the ,. shorts
by the calling' In ot long stock, A rise of 4
In General EJectrfo and a full recovery ot
jtrrttrcay'a violent 6>oUaÂ«- la Kwr Tor* All
Brake were on light dealings and attracted
little attention. Quite a number of obscure
low-priced stocks moved upward from 1 to 4
points with no other apparent reason than to
adjust their price* to the higher level recently
attained by the general list.* The market con
tinued very broad, but the reactionary ten
dency was quite marked through a large por
tion of the list. Including the Vanderbllt group.
The market I'm- bonds continued active and
strong without important exception. Total
sales, par value, $4,915,000.
United States Ss (oM), 4s and 6s advanced

CLOSING.
A good volume of business was transacted In
the market* here to-day, but the tone was
weak, the failure of the bank to advance the
minimum discount rate being counteracted by
the bank return, which showed that Â£1,000,000
had swne Into the interior. This suggested
dearer money, which was the principal toplo
of conversation. Americans were distinctly
active, but the fluctuations here were moderate.
New York opening; caused only half an hour's
rally, the dose being at the lowest. The
prices rallied In the street Northern Pacifies
were bought In Influential quarters on the
rumor that the preferred stock is to be con
verted into bonds. . Illinois Central also - was
bought, mainly for the reason that ; It has
been hitherto neglected. The failure of the
bank to change the discount rate has had a
favorable effect on the exchanges; and no gold
was taken out, although Paris is buying eoma
in the open market. India is resuming silver
purchases.
The banks of Bengal and Bombay have re
duced their discount rates from 7 to 6.

OAKLAND. Dec. 2O.-Wlth rare
coolness and presence of mind.
Alma Cahill. thirteen years old,
prevented a panic Tuesday even-
Ing during an entertainment at
Klinkner Hall, Golden Gate. There were
400 people In the auditorium, and the af
fair was running smoothly when sudden
ly a burst of flame among the stage dec
orations caused a startled rush among the
auditors. Little Miss Cahill was at the
center of the stage in the midst of a reci
tation. The greenery and cloth embellish
ments were smoking and blazing, but the
child did not stir, nor check her words.
Â¦whlch-Â«eemed to come from her lips more
clearly and strongly as she observed the
danger.
Her coolness checked the spasmodic
movement that was started, and men who
eat near the flaming decorations tore
them down and stamped out the danger
ous fire. As soon as the last spark had
been crushed out the startled people
regained their composure, and the inter
rupted entertainment was resumed.
The stage was illumined In front bv gas
footlights. Some of the finery used In
the decorations was drooped too closely
to the burners. The stuff became hot dur
ing the evening, but the danger was un
noticed until, without a bit of warning,
the flames broke forth. They were ob
served quickly enough to present a more
serious result than occurred. Little Miss
Cahill was given an ovation by the audi
ence when she had completed her num-

along with my recitation, and did not

did the scare that the audience might
have. By not stopping the attention of
the people was kept and the fire was
soon put*out." Miss Cahill resides at 1012

Oakland Offlca San Francisco Call.
1118 Broadway.' Dec. 20.
The Southern Pacific Company h.i3 come
out into the open with the renewal of its
schem-i for the compulsory insurance of
employes. Ten days ago The Call told
the story of the rr.ovement tVsat hart been
started to awaken interest in the sup
posedly defunct plan. To-day the com
pany posted in its yard offices at West
Oakland a long petition which the men
are supposed to sign. The petition covers
practically the same scheme that was
tought by the brotherhoods last summer
ana is to alt appliances the identical
proposition, revamped and placed beiora
the men again, 'lnis 13 the third stage
of the deliberate violation of the promise
made by the late Collis **. litintington to
tha brotherhoods that the scheme would,
be abandoned."
The first mow was the publications on
Insurance which have been made by The
Railway Employe, a journal published by
G. Sanford, a clerk in the auditor's de
partment of the Youthen*, Pacific Com
pany. Thtre folKwe.1 a call for & con
ference of railroad men at the "Railway
Employe's" office. These moves had the
sanction of the official heads of the com
pany and were directed, it is believed
among the men. by A. F. Hess, who waa
Imported last spring from the East to in
augurate the Insurance scheme. Coupled
with these "educational" moves was tha
sending out of carefully worded letters
and the circulation among the workmen
in the shop and yards of matter bearing
upon railroad insuiance.
This prclimlnury work cf revival has
culminated In the public posting of the
petition which calls for the voluntary ap
plication by signers for the inauguration
of the insurance scheme.
The move is confined to the unorganized
employes so far as can be seen at present.

PENYER. Dec. IM.-The strange influ
. r.ce with which Mrs. J. G. Warner led
pretty Mips T.izzle Clarkson from the
b me of her father. Rev. J. F. Ciark*on.
D Tojr.eka. Han., to make her n despised
nurnial in Mrs. Warner's home In Denver
CBd lately in San FTancisco sterns to have
\Trn<1e<l to the Hev. Charles H. Coo*
who was until recently rector of Eplph
c-ny Episcopal Mission in this city.
:.;r. Cock, who is a gTadurtte of Ann Ar
b*r and v.ho Is a doctor of philosophy,
| r,s been doing missionary work In Colo
rado and Wyoming: for twelve: year*, the
:as?i three years of which he spent in Den
ver, lie was very successful. Two years
r?o. however, he met Mrs. Joseph G.
"U trner. t\ ho posed as a spiritualist. He
began to study a different kind of psy
chology. He read all that has been writ,
ten on the subject of spiritualism. He
s-iw a new light. Though pastor of the
EpJpnanjP Mission, most of his time was
f pent with Mrs. Warner and her devotees.
"}iis violin disappeared from his home
i-p.d he refused to tell what had been done
with it. Now it is learned that he had
&Ken it to the home of Mrs. Warner at
No. 3S2S High street, where he played to
make the spirits and ejwoks come forth
and -dance across Mrs. Warner's parlor
flror.
.His family was averted. The people of
his church congregation btgan to com
plain. The crisis came last month. He
received a polite nÂ«te asking him to re
sign from the mission. Without any ob
jection he did so.
Rev. Cook could not agree with his fam
lljr- He left home and then devoted all
iiis time to the spell that enthralled him.
His wife and little son were left without
anything but what they earned. He took
to lecturing on spiritualism. The Warner*
moved to San Francisco pome months ago
and have vrirteti him many times to
ccme there. He was* anxious to go but
could not raise the money for a ticket.
Several times he approached Dean Hart,
of the St. Jrhr.s Cathedral, asking him
to secure a pays. Mrs. Cook did not want
him to k<Â» to San Francisco. She knew
that li wa? an effort to again get within
the influence of Mrs. Warner's "black
cup." but two weeks aco Dean Hart did
get Dr. Cook a jv>Â«=s, and he is supposed
to be with the AVarners In San Francisco**
Before Rev. Cook left he secured a let
tor from Bishop Spaldir.g transferring
him to the diocese of California. It is
r.ot known if he win make an effort to
secure a charge ia the Episcopal church
there.
Two of Mi?? Clarkson's brothers passed
through Denver a few days ago bound for
San Francifco. where they will attempt
to' rescue her from Mrs. Wanrer's influ
erce.

Pastorate, and Follows Medium

The action of the Superior Court in the
suit filed by Mrs. Jane L. Stanford against
the city and county of San Francisco to
recover taxes, s paid' under protest,* upon
certain stocks and bonds situated In New
York city, in sustaining the domurrer. to
the complaint, was yesterday affirmed by
the Supreme Court. The decision la an in
teresting one as it decides an Important
question of law. Â¦Â¦Â¦' â¢
It appeared from the plaintiffs, com
plaint that at his death Senator Stanford
was the owner of , a large number ,; of
stocks and shares and certain- bonds- of
foreign corporations, all of which, except
certain described shares of stocks, were,
on and prior to the first Monday in March,
1<*4, in the State of New York, pledged as
collateral security for the payment or a
loan and were therefore never In the pos
session of the executrix. Before the as
sessment in question, Mrs. Stanford made
a formal statement in writing to the As
sessor that the property assessed by him
had not been In her possession since
the first Monday in March 1894.
Mrs. Stanford appeared before the
Board of Equalization " and i made
application to strike out the assessment.
Bhe fully set forth the facts in the mat
ter. She contended that bo far as the exe
cutrix was concerned these stocks ami
bonds were held outside of this Stato and
were never in her possession or control,
and therefore not taxable here; thar. un
der sections 1C13 and 1615 of the Code of
Civil Procedure the executrix was charge
able only with such property as might
come into her possession and was not re
sponsible for what she could not collect.
Mrs. Stanford's counsel in his brief Â¦ on
appeal stated that upon her appointment
as executrix she filed an inventory
and appraisement and as was her duty
included therein a list of the stocks and
bonds In question, which she had been in
formed were in New York city and there
fore could not be taxed here:
In Its decision the Supreme Court says:
Decision Declares Stocks Are Taxable

Lies Even Though They
Are Elsewhere. :

San Francisco merchants will try to
obtain direct, steamship communication
between this port and Manila. The San
Francisco Board , of Trade has /petitioned
the Pacific Mall Steamship Company to
run their vessels to Manila. As an alter
native it has been suggested 'that a line
of steamships to connect at Hongkong
with the Pacific Mail and to carry Philip
pine The* present arrangement is
unsatisfactory to the merchants at Mani
la, who do; business with San Francisco.
Goods in transit, which have been stored
in Hongkong, have been broken into while
in the storehouses. The Manila merchants,
subjected to delay and loss for which
there has been no redress, have written
letters to San' Francisco, threatening to
do business solely with places : connected
by direct | lines to Manila. '
New York does business directly with
the Philippines and is noturally & formid
able competitor; with San Francisco for
business. Tacoma is also . to have - direct
communication with Manila, beginning
next month. The Northern Pacific Rail
road has chartered the steamer Glenfarg,
which will sail from Tacoma for Manila
January 17 and will be followed by. other
vessels. v . . Â¦
Goods from San , Francisco for Manila
have been laid down for two trirjs at
Hongkong. They have been carried to Ma
nila Dy a. line independent of the 'Pacific
Mail. From this condition of affairs has
arisen much trouble. When goods have
been missed from packages the two lines
have passed the buck, each claiming that
the other was responsible. Â¦ So warm have
the Manila merchants become that they
have boycotted one steamer line between
the Philippines and Hongkong.
, The communication of the' San Francis
co Board of Trade has not been answered
by the Pacific Mail, but assurance has
been received that it has been taken un
der consideration.

the council will 1 not permit any of Its
members to work on buildings Vhlch are
using material from the nine-hour mills.

The Supervisors' . Street Committee rec
ommended yesterday that the petition of
the San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley
Railway Company to amend its franchise
for a steam railroad on Illinois street be
granted. This amendment will permit of
the transfer of- the franchise to the At
chison, Topeka and. Santa Fe road.
The petition of the. same company for
a franchise on Tombigbee street to con
nect with Illinois street was laid over, for
one week. The committee will make a
trip of Inspection over the portions of
street designated in the franchise.
Commissioner Maguire, of .the Board of
Public Works, sought to prevail on the
committee to- accept Its ideas for paving
several , downtown streets. He favored a
cobblestone foundation for a bituminous
or asphalt pavement, at. it would cost four
cents per square fool as against eight
cents for concrete. .The committee rather
favored the plan, but directed the Board
of Works to estimate the cost of the
cruslied cobblestone to be used in the con
crete pave. . â¢' . .
Supervisor Dtvyer called the Board of
Works sharply to account for Ignoring
the request of his committee for specifica
tions for bitumen and concrete. ; â¢
"The statement made by Hanson and
yourself that' there are twenty-one miles
of, cobbles in this city that could be used
in repavine: of streets is absurd." f said
Dwyer. "There are . less than ten miles
'of cobbles, and It is not true that $150,000
could be saved by using them. Less than
half that amount would.be saved."
"The. Board ' of Works 'recommends
cobbles." said Connor. ' "and. we are still
opposed "to -them. â¢ Several months have
beon frittered away In trying to pave
four. blocks." ,
â¢ Chairman Â¦ Curtis favored cobblestones
only if crushed as such a foundation was
successfully used in Philadelphia. .
Edgar, Painter addressed the committee
regarding the petition- of -the North Cen
tral Improvement Association for the con
struction . of a tunnel- on 'Montgomery
Btreet, from Jackson to '. Lombard, to af
ford communication with the business sec
tion and the new. wharves to be built by
th'e Harbor Commission, i The Board j of
Works was directed to make an estimate
of the cost of the proposed tunnel.
Supervisor Booth addressed the commit
tee in favor of- his seven-foot fence ordi
nance,, but no. action was, taken. The
ten-foot ordinance, which goes into effect
July 1, 1901, is. deemed adequate.

ITS FRANCHISE
A NUMBER of the employes of the
John Finn Metal Works had a
narrow escape from death or
serious Injury . yesterday. A
boiler of molten metal exploded
and while half a dozen men were burned
only one was seriously injured. His name
is Daniel Foley and he lives in East
Berkeley. His wounds were dressed at thÂ»
Harbor Hospital and later in the day he
was removed to his home across the bay.
It appears that all hands in the, metal
works were melting some preparation
with which to do some galvanizing. The
molten mass had almost come to a white
heat and the workmen were getting ready
to remove It from the furnace. Suddenly
there was an upheaval and a report that
was heard a block. All the workmen
SOUTHERN PACIFIC
MAY BUILD BRANCH
Said to Be Seeking a Cut
off From Salt LakÂ« to
Los Angeles.
Vice President J. C. Stubbs was asked
yesterday what the Southern Pacific pro
posed to do to offset the Increased com
petition that is bound to follow the com
pletion of Senator Clark's new road from
Salt Lake City to Los Angeles. Mr.
Stubbs was not disposed to talk upon the
matter.
"In the first place it Is too early to make
any plans," said Mr. Stubbs. "The con
struction of the Clark road hasn't even
commenced yet. Then, again, if I did
know the plans ot our company In regard
to this particular matter I would not feel
disposed to tell them to the newspapers.
I would rather the information should
come from the construction department.
Ask Mr. Huntlngton or Mr. Hayes when
they Bet out here." ~ . ,â tn
The van- fact that the Southern 'Pacific
officials are" inclined to belittle the- project
of closer rail connections between Salt
Lake and Lob Angeles Is taken by many
railroad men to Indicate that there is
something: in the wind. .' "Â¦
Chief Kngineer Hood was asked if an
had received any orders in regard to sur
veying and he replied in the negative. II
is stated by one who professes to know
that the plan under consideration by the
company is the' construction of a road
from the company's main line at Mojave
to the terminus of the Carson and Colo
rado line at Keeler. The distance would
be about 146 miles. Some fifty miles have
been surveyed out of â¢ Mojave. which â¢
leaves less ' than 100 miles â¢ for the en
gineers to go over and lay out a route.
As 1Â» well known, the -Southern Pacific
owns the Carson and Colorado â¢ line,* hav
ing acquired possession of It a year, or
so ago. This line runs, to Mound House,
where the Virginia City and Truckee road
meets It. The Truckee line meets the
Central Pacific at â¢ Reno. -Thus it will- be
eoen that with the 146 miles of track need
ed from Mojave to Keeler and with ac
cess over the Truckee lino from '.Virginia
Citv. the Southern Pacific, will be able to
bring about a substantial cut-off from
Salt Lake to Los Angeles without a grreat
deal of expense. ..Another plan suggest
ed and one which would give the com
pany a still shorter route to Salt Lake
Is to build. a branch road from the term
inus of the Carson and Colorado line at
Virginia City, meeting the Central Pacific
line near Wadsworth or Hot Springs.

It is seml-officlally denied ' here that
Senator W. A. Clark hag recently â¢ ob
tained control of large holdings of tim
ber land- In Humboldt ' County. A, San
Francisco paper published a story, a few
days ago that Senator Clark had pur-
Chased outright some 5000 acres of these
lands and that be had obtained an option
on about . 200,000 acres more. Thomas E.

started to run, but hardly one of the
crowd escaped the molten metal. Every
where it lit on a human being.it burnt
through to the skin and some half dozen
of the boys had to be sent home.
Daniel Foley was nearest to the cal
dron and when the explosion came all ha
could do was to shield his face. The
molten metal burnt both his arms. It
stripped off his clothing from his neck to
the small of his hick. His right foot was
also badly burned. Dr. Bacigalupi atten.l
ed to the injured man at the hospital. The
remainder of the lnjur&d were sent home.
The foreman of the Finn Metal Works
saw to It that all hands were attended
to. Said he:
"It was an accident that is liable to
occur at any time and like an explosion
in a powder factory, cannot be guarded
against. We took all possible care, but
accidents will happen,- and I'm awful
sorry for the boys." . :
EXPLOSION OF GALVANIZING METAL THAT ENDANGERED THE
LIVES OF HALF . A DOZEN WORKMEN AT THE JOHN FINN
"WORKS, AND THE ONLY MAN SERIOUSLY BURNED.
The baiting of Charles H. Smith, cashier
of the Southern Pacific Company, by his
wife, Josephine Smith, continued before
Judge \ Daingerneld yesterday. Even
though it! may be the last of its kind for
her Mrs. Smith is reaping full delight
from her opportunity to cross-examine
her husband in the action for divorce in
stituted by himjon the ground of crueltyâ
unspeakable cruelty.
For four hours yesterday Mrs. Smith
cross-examined her husband, as she called
it â nagged and* taunted him as the court
frequenters "sized It up." Smith's pa
tience is of that quality that passeth alii
understanding and during the hours on Â¦
the stand he sat . ajid courteously an- ;
swered every question asked by his wife,
some of which would have loosed the rage ,
in almost any man. . \
When Mrs. Smith - was - not questioning |
her husband on : matters of fact more or j
less material she was charging him with j
theft or embezzlement or abuse or un
i speakable crimes. She broke through the !
lines drawn to limit the scope of her ex- j
amlnatlon and. serenely, evaded sugges
tions of the court and once openly defied
Its authority to control her.
Judge ' Dalngerneld announced that the
case would be called for hearing again
this morning. Mrs. Smith tartly answered
that she would not be in court at the time
stated. Judge Daingerneld instructed: her
that, she must be in court.' Mrs. Smith
asserted that she would not. Judge
Daingerneld looked discouraged. He was
helpless in- the face of the .lady's deter
mination -and Smith, who was on the
stand, looked sympathetically at the
court. Mrs. Smith's? "I won't" was ac
cepted as final by Judge Daingerneld and
when the time for adjournment came the
court announced -that the hearing would
not be again taken up until Monday. Mrs.
Smith smiled triumphantly.
When the case was called for hearing
yesterday morning the dialogue between
husband and wife, she being the inter
rogator, continued as follows:
"And your wife, this defendant, tried to
tear your clothes, did siÂ»e?"
"i'es.she tried to cut my best suit to
pieces with a pair of shears."* % . â¢/
"Who prevented her?"
"I did.
"You d4d. How?"
"By - taking possession of my clothing
and locking it in a closet.
"You used force?"
"Yes, I seized you around the waist."
"Was it a loving embrace?"
"Oh, that's foolish."
"You say I hit you with a dish and cut
a gash two inches long?"
<Y Y/cs, that is what I said."
".Let me look at the wound."
"Oh, don't come so close," said Smith,
edging away, but Mrs. Smith hurried to
the witness chair, calmly examined her
husband's forehead and then exclaimed:
"I don't see any scar."
"Well, It is there," answered Smith.
"That's right. Stick to it," came the
answer. â¢ ;
"Why did you keep all of those letters?"
"I knew that if I gave you rope
enough " .
"I would hang myself," Interrupting
and finishing the answer.
"Are you proud of the miserable ftpecta
cle you make on the witness stand?'"
Smith refrained from answering.
"Now, you said that I beat you on the
back with a horse whip when you were on
the floor with our son on top of you. Your
back was on the floor, and, as you say I
whipped you on the back, I want to know
how many backs you've got."
Art objection was sustained. .
"Havo you ever . received affectionate
lettersâ very fine letters of divorce-rfrom
mc7"
"No. You are incapable of writing a
fine or affectionate letter." . - .
"Did you ever beat one of your land
ladles?"
"Not that I remember," Smith
ansv/ered.
-Â¦ "Were you ever arrested for petty lar
ceny?'.' '
An objection was sustained, but Smith
offered an emphatic denial.
Finally Mrs. Smith ran Into ground
where all objections to her line of ques
tions was sustained; and she appealed to
Attorney Walker, who represents 1 her !
husband, to frame her a question. Mr.
Walker smillnsdy accommodated her. She
asked the question. Walker objected to it
and was sustained by the court.
With Hashing eyes she looked at Smith
arid sighed: â¢ -
"Ah! If I only had some brains."
"Amen!" came a voice from the
benches, " and everybody . but Mrs. Smith
enjoyed a smile. â¢
"Is It not a fact," continued Mrs. Smith
"that you told this defendant that you
stole money out of the railroad safeâ that
you took money from the safe and bought
stocks with it?"
, "It is not a fact," answered Smith,
serenely. â¢
"Did you not tell this defendant at one
time that- you couldn't -balance your
books, and 'was afraid the captain wouM
find it out?" .
"I- relieve your m'nd Is wandering,"
groaned the witness In reply. - -
"Now, you say in your complaint that I
accuse you of getting that dog. bite -on
your face- In a manner that- 1 cannot un
derstand. 'You will explain what you
mean in your complaint."
"I mean what I say in the complaint,"
answered Smith. , . , . Â¦ Â¦
VThat dog bite on your face," said Mrs.
Smith, turning to the court,- "was put on
your face as an identifying mark and a
mark of your r.Ins, and that is one of the
things about your face that makes thÂ«
women in the miserable den you , visited
talk about how homely you are." '.
An expression of mingled pity and con
tempt was on the features of the. witness,
but he did nof answer.- An adjournment
until Monday morning was then ordered.

on His Estate.

Twenty-flve years ago Jarnes Xolan de
serted his wife. Mary Xolan, in the East
and came to California. A few weeks
ago Mrs. Nolan looked upon, his face for
the first time in this quarter of a century
snd then his body reposed In a coffin at
the asylum for the insane at Napa. Yes
terday Judge Coffey granted Mrs. Nolan
letters of administration upon the JSOOO
estate of the deceased and she will at
once enter into possession.
A few days ag^o Mrs. Nolan flled her
petition for letters of administration upon
decedent'6 estate. Other heirs, represent
ed by Attorney Frank FalVon, opposed her
petition. The petition was called for hear
ing yesterday and Mrs. Nolan came Into
court to tell her story. She is a comely
appearing old lady and Tier venerable ap
pearance added weight to her dramatic
story as she recited it.
"When my husband and I were chil
dren." she said. "w<? knew each other in
Ireland. Finally our parents emigrated
to Ohio. When I was 17 years of age and
my huFband was 25 we were married and
nioved to St. Louis. In 1875 my husband
deserted me and my two children, John
F. and Thomas, and caraa West, I did
not know where at the time. Finally I
decided to lea\ - e my home and take up
a. residence in this State, and with my
children 1 Journeyed to San Francisco.
One day I took my children out to North
Beach and as wÂ« passed near Telegraph
Hill I saw my husband leading: a horse
out cf a livery stai>le. I did not stop to
epeak to him. but iht. next day I decided
to eo end find him and ask him why he
had left us, but could find no trace of
him.
"I lately came into possession of a paper
that contained the news of the death of a
Joseph Nolan at Napa Asylum on Novem
ber SO and 1 decided to eo and eee If it
was nÂ« my husband. I went to the asy
lum and there I found him in a coffin,
