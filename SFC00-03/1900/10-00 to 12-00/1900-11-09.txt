LIKE a spectre in the fog the
Austrian steel steamer Olga
lay grounded last night, half a
mile from the beach and two
"miles south from the' Cliff
House. Enveloped in a thick, murky mist,
she' beat' her way toward the straits.
Confounded by whistles, the absence of,
the lightship and the gray gloom which sat !
upon the sea. Captain Descovich. peering
into bleak space from the bridge of his
ship, felt the grinding of the keel on the
sands soon after 4 o'clock yesterday after
noon. It was his first ocean voyage to
this city. Looking fcr the* signals from
the lightship and' pricking his ears for di
recting sounds that would give him guid
ance, he suddenly found himself beached,
the roar of the breakers In his ears and
his keel hard and fast in the soft sands
of the ocean shorÂ«.
Early In the afternoon a fog, thick to
impenetrability, settled upon the besch
and drove the few pleasure-seekers hurry
scurrying toward town. About 4 o'clock,
when every evidence of human life had
vanished from the beach, four shril'
blasts were heard by the crew of the
South Side Life-saving Station. Soon
after the dense fog lifted and the anxious,
eager life-savers saw the black outlineb
cf the Olga Just beyond the break of the
Eurf, but hard aground.
Little time was lost. In a moment the
crew, with its boat on the wagon, was
tearing down the beach toward a favor
able place of embarkation. Notified by
the warning whistles of the South Side
Station, the crews of the Golden Gate and
Fort Point stations manned their boats
and drove toward the scene of distress.
Captain Hobson with h's Kngllsh surf
boat, signaled the tug Relief, which was
bound for the reported wreck. He was
passed a line by Captain John Si'ovlch,
and away tugboat and lifeboat rolled,
breasting the waves for a rescue.
The three life saving crews on the
scene, their boats riding through the
breakers to the ill-fated Olga, the tug Re
lief gave the whistle signal to Patrolman
Hyslop for more assistance. The Alert
and Reliance were called for and they
steamed through the stralts-at full speed.
These three tugs' then -fa&fened tbelr haw
sers to the Olpa and". applied. Just enough
power to prevent the grounded ship from
being washed further" ashore , by the In
coming tide. The tug Rescue, hearing of
the Olga's mlshapi 1 went- out to- '{rive as
sistance, but finding the Alert.. Relief and
Reliance at work 'on the distressed ship
she started to return to the city.'
After the Re3cuo' had passed the Golden
Gate on the return she met the Sea King
and Monarch steaming out. Upon a sig
nal from Captain Gray the Rescue Joined
the Sea King and Monarch and all three
beat tracks toward the Olga on the beach.
At an early hour this morning the Relief,
Alert and Reliance were tugging at the
Olga to prevent her from "turtllng." and
the Rescue, Monarch and Sea King were
lying off and on In case of necessity.
When the Olga grounded the tide was
low. At 1 o'clock this afternoon the tide
will be high ana an attempt will then be
made to tear the'Olga free from her sand
moorings. In the meantime three tug
boats will hold the ship steady.
Last night the Olga was practically un
injured by her mishap. She lav broadside

There is more or less gossip about pos

"Full returns to-day leave the,situation

308 electoral votes. I We have carried
every Northern State but Colorado, Ne
vada and Montana. We have carried
Kentucky, Maryland, Delaware and West

us of the electoral votes in Kentucky un
der the power of the Goebel law. If they
succeed we shall have 295 electoral votes.
Our candidate for Governor wires that we
have carried Kentucky for the electoral
ticket and elected him by over 7000. The
time has come when the American people
ought to insist at whatever cost that the
votes shall be counted, as they were hon

OMAHA. Nov. 8.â Complete returns
from two-thirds of the counties and scat
tering returns from the balance show
that McKlnley has carried Nebraska by a
plurality of at least 2000. An equal num
ber of returns on the State ticket Indicate
that Nebraska has elected Governor
Poynter and the entire State ticket by
pluralities ranging from 500 to 1800 over
the Republicans, the Governor, being high
man.
If the balance of the State shows the
same , percentage of gain and loss,
Poynter's election is certain, and the
counties to be heard from being mostly
in the western part of the State, it is fair
to presume that this is the case.
The Legislature will likely be decided
by Douglass County. In which it will take
the official count to determine the vote.
The World-Herald (Democratic) claims
the Lieutenant Governor will cast the de
ciding vote in the upper House, and that
the lower House is evenly divided, with
two placts in doubt.
The State Republican Committee, which
last night gave out the claims that Dlde
rich and the Republican State ticket were
elected with from 5000 to 7000 majority,
this afternoon scales down "close to the
danger line," and claimed the election of
the State ticket by from 100") to 2000.
In Douglass County the count is close,
and charges of fraud are* made by the
Democrats.' The Republicans claim to
have elected one out of three Senators
and six out of nine Representatives, while
the Democrats claim two Senators and all
the Representatives.
LOUISVILLE. Ky;, Nov. 9.â At 12:30
a. m. the Courier-Journal, with returns
from all but eleven of the 1SS4 precincts
in Kentucky, puts Bryan's majority at

precincts are sparsely settled, and gave in
the last State election combined Repub
lican majorities of less than 500. In arriv
ing at the figures, 7S0O and 4150, as the ma
jorities respectively of Bryan and Beck
ham, the usual. Republican majorities in
the missing eleven precincts were allowed
for.
John W. Yerkes, Republican candidate
for Governor, left to-night for his home at
Danville.
The Louisville Commercial (R.) will to
morrow say the election is "very close."
It will not concede the defeat ot Yerkes
and the McKlnley electors, and will say
that the official count only can determine
the result.
Chairman Coombs of the Republican
State Campaign Committee was quoted
to-day, as follows: "While we have not
the figures thoroughly compiled, yet wo
are certain that Yerkes carried Kentucky
by a small though safe majority. The re
sult is very close. I think that it will
probably require the official count to de
termine how the State goes. When I left

but in some counties there was wholesale

Fayette County, for instance, In two pre

In Breathitt 600 persons -were kept from

All the papers discuss the coincidence
of three notable cases in which the swing
of the political pendulum has been ar
rested, and the Daily News remarks:
"Does it portend a new factor In Demo
cratic politics? The only safe conclu
sion is that what has happened is not
because Lord Salisbury. Mr. McKinley
and Sir Wilfrid Laurier had discovered
a. way of governing without mistakes, but
because in all three countries there has
been a stlrrinR of national life to new
and great issues and because the opposi
tion parties have been found out of touch
with national feelinp."

LONDON. Nov. 8.â In commenting on
the Canadian elections the morning
papers, Irrespective of party, express un
bounded satisfaction at Sir Wilfrid Lau
rier's victory. The Daily News utilizes it
to read a lesson to the British anti-war
Liberals, and says: "It is a remarkable
fact which Liberals nearer home would do
well to ponder that no more eloquent
statements of the British cause have been
made than by Â£%â¢ Wilfrid Laurier."

Hartz^ll is supposed to be on the way to
IxÂ«= Angelas v.nd the police of that city
have been notified to arrest him.
About thr'-e weeks asro Hartzell. who
iÂ« woil known in Sun Jose, married an
Â«Â»*tirr.ab!c young womr.n -named Bessie
Rhowers. Refore their honeymoon was
â¢ tided Hartzrll proceeded to mak* love to
Miss McCcrmick. Notwithstanding that
search for him. . Failing to find him, she
returned to her room, where she remained
until yesterday. After satisfying herself
that he had deserted her, meeting a police
man on Market street she revealed her
identity and asked to be sent back to San
Jose.
After being taken tosthe City Prison the
girl admitted that she was in love with
Hartzell and seemed anxious to shield
him.
"I knew he was a married man when 1
consented to elope with him," she re
marked, "but as he was so good and
kind I never thought he would desert me.
When I first n**t him he professed to be
in love with Vne, and as I thought he was
telling the truth I asked him what he in
tended to do with his wife. He told me
ihat h<> had made a mistake in marrying
Miss Showers and that he intended get
tine a divorce from her. On this promise
to nurry me as soon as he was legally
?eparatei1 from Ills wife, I consented to
elope with him.
"After lo;i\inr San Jose he took all the
money I had on the pretense that he
would take carp of it. Notwithstanding
that he has left me, I still love him and
hope some day to hernmc his wife."
La.<t night Deputy Sheriff Raehe of San
Jose arrived here to take charge of the
girl. He caused a charge of petty larceny
to be recorded againsi h<r for stealing a
pkirt from a Mrs. Stanfield. for whom
slip worked as a domestic. Tho money
which was taken from her hy Hartzell
was stolen from Mrs. Shepherd of San

disposed, however, toward her former
girl companion, Maud McCormick. who
eloped with Hartzell. She blames the girl
ajid declares she should be punished and
sent to the reform school.
The two girlB of 16 were close chums
and when Bessie Showers married War
ren Hartzell scarcely a day passed that
Maud McCormick did not call on the
young matron. Now, Mrs. Hartzell says
she sees through it all and should have
kicked Maud from the house. While her
husband was telling her of his undying
love, Mrs. Hartzell now realizes, Maud
McCormick was making love to him, her
sole purpose being to elope with him.
Mrs. Hartzpll said this afternoon that
she and her husband had always been
happy and when she found out he had de
serted her for Maud It was a fearful
shook to her.
"Yes. I want my husband to come
home," she said to-day. "I will forgive
him if he comes back aTÂ»d behaves him
self. I love him dearly, more than he
does mo, and I will overlook this matter.
Maud MrCormick should be punishedâ put

evening the couple left San Jose and came
to this city. On the way herÂ©, the girl
claims, Hartzell took her purse, contain

take care of it. After reaching here the
couple went to a lodging-house on Third
and Mission streets, where they regis

The following day Hartzell said he had
an engagement with his brother and
promised to return in a short time. After

Shooting Occurred During a,. Rough,
and Tumble Fight in a Res

SAN JOSE, Nov. 8.â Thomas J. Winship
was acquitted of the murder of, Frank j
Xarvaez by a jury In Judge Lorlgan's :
court to-day. The case was given to the
Jury at noon and at 2:30 they returned
with a verdict of not guilty. !
The killing of Narvaez occurred In the
Universal restaurant on the night of June
4, and had every appearance of a cold
blooded murder. Both men had been
drinking. Winship entered the place to
get something to eat and took a seat at a
table near Narvaez and a companion.
Narvaez and Winship engaged in some
words, which led to a scuffle, in which
Â¦Winship shot .Xarvaez through the neck.
"Wlnahlp then paid his bill, walked out of
the place and was not arrested until the
next day. Then he confessed the crime,
but said he had acted in self-defense.
"Winship was twice tried for the murder. j
The first trial resulted in a disagreement,
the jury standing 7 to 5 for acquittal. His
defense was a double dhe. Besides act
ing In self-defense, he claimed the shoot-
Ing was accidental. "U'lnship testified that
when he went to leave the restaurant
Narvaez blocked his way with a table
knife in his hand. He grappled with him,
and in doing so his pistol was about to
fall from his pocket. He then grabbed
his gun and in the scuffle it was dis
charged.
Xarvaez was a cousin of Jack Ortega,
now awaiting sentence for g assaulting
Grace Gamble. Both Ortega and Winship
were confined in the same tank, and a few
days/ ago Ortega threatened to kill Win
ship. Through the diligence of Jailer
Drelschmeyer Ortega's . threat was pre
vented, and OrU'Ra confined in a cell.
The killing of Narvaez was not the first
serious trouble Winship was in. He is
well known to the San Francisco police.
On* May 3, 1S72. in San Francisco. Winship
was arrested for shooting August D.
Rowland. He was charged with assault
to kill. The jury disagreed and the case
was finally dropped. He was again ar
rested on August 3. 1S74, for assault to
commit murder on Albert Peterson. Win
ship was finally allowed to plead guilty
to assault and battery and served one
year in the County Jail. On November
20 1SS5 he assaulted his wife. Elizabeth
Winship. with a deadly weapon. It was
afterward reduced to simple assault, and
he pleaded guilty and served three months
in the County Jail. This evidence was In
the District Attorney's hands, but as
Winship made no attempt to prove his
character it could not be introduced.

discharged every few seconds, bombs and
cannon roared, while red fire and rockets
incarnadined the scene.
James McLachlan. the CongressmRn
rlect from this district, was the hero of
the hour. The Americus Club drew him
In an improvised triimphal car to the
City Hall, where brir-f speeches were to
have been made, but the crowd was mak
ing so much noise that the spoech-making
part of the programme was dispensed
with. Other successful candidates and

REPUBLICAN VICTORY
the party in this State. This unwonted
activity signifies that an important event
of some character is in view, and possibly
a demonstration In honor of the great
victory is under consideration. It is true
that no parade was held in San Francisco
prior 'to. the election, but that is no rea
son why one should not take place after
the battle and the. triumph.
The Republican County Committee of
course will not feel likÂ» taking a promi
nent part in the proposed demonstration.
It should be understood that the commit
tee is in half mourning over the loss of
the Martin Kelly pets on both tickets,
hence a spectacle of the committee on
parade at this time would be a mockery
of grief. The defeat of Dibble and the
election of Belsha'w cast a. gloom in other
and higher circles, therefore the proposi
tion for public display of rejoicing may
not be well received all along the line.
Stalwart anti-boss Republicans, how
ever, should unfurl the flag to the breeze.
The victory for prosperity, good govern
ment and clean politics was indeed great
and glorious. It Is eminently proper that
a victory won by the people should be
celebrated by the people, and there would
be no Impropriety in asking the State
Central Committee to Join the joyful pro
cession.

tee, ought to be removed. Removal from
the committee may not' be demanded, but
he ought to be ousted from his job ad
Wharfinger for pernicious activity in
working with Martin Kelly.- Phil Crim
mins, Sam Rainey and J. D. Phelan to
defeat J. H. Nelson, the Republican can

â J.
dldate for State Senator in the Twenty
fifth Senatorial District. Buckley joined
the bosses to thwart the will of the. peo
ple and the State should not pay him for
that kind of service. If he had enter
tained conscientious scruples against vot
ing for Mr. Nelson ha had the undoubted
right to vote as his conscience dictated.
The secret ballot protects the citizen m
this right. Buckley, however, paraded
himself as an opponent of the Republican
nominee because the bosses wanted him
to support Jack O'Connell. the Phelan
candidate.
Clark Albert! of San. Diego is early '.i
the field as a candidate for assistant clerk
of the Assembly for the thirty-fourtii
session of the Legislature.
Another Wharfinger, M. A. Smith, wno
is on the State payroll for $1500 a year,
was working and shouting for the nom
inee of the bosses and knifing the Re
publican candidate. J. H. Nelson. The
job which Smith holds ought to be filled
by a decent citizen. He is not a member
of the State committee, but the zeal which
he displays in the service of the lowest
type of bosses qualifies him for life mem
bership in Martin Kelly's county com
mittee.
It Is reported that Mike Barry, who is
on the State payroll as a collector of
tolls, joined In the crusade against tha
Republican nominee. .,

SENATORS PERKINS and Bard
will confer at an early day with
a view of arriving at some' con
clusion in regard to filling tho
vacancy in the office of Collector
of Customs for the port of San Francisco.
A week prior to the election they met in
Orange County and agreed to defer final
action on a recommendation until the
Presidential contest was decided. It was
then understood that some widely known
and capable business man of this* city
ought to be recommended to the.Presi
dent for. appointment. Ability to agree
must have been regarded as certain be
cause both Senator announced that sep
arate recommendations would not ba
made.
The impression exists that the Senators
will agree to recommend Horace Davis.
He Is not in any sense a candidate for
the office, but many influential merchants
have suggested his appointment. His per
sonal inclination is to decline additional
work and new responsibilities, as* his tinvi
is occupied in .-mending to large affairs
already committed to his care.
The election of Frank L. Coombs to
Congress to represent the First District
will create a vacancy in the office of
United States District Attorney. The va\
cancy may not occur until March 4 next,
but gossip concerning Mr. Coombs' suc
cessor is rife. in Federal office-holding
circles. Many dpplications for the place
have been filed. The story goes that Sen
ator Bard's recommendation in this re
spect will settle the appointment and that
.Marshall B. Woodworth, Assistant United
States District Attorney, it so highly in
dorsed by Judges of the Federal Cour''
and members of the State Senate that the
place will be given to him.
Within a year the official term of John
C. Lynch, collector first revenue distr'ct
of California, will expire. The compen
sation of the office is $4500 per annum. It
appears to he settled that a Rood Repub
lican will be appointed to the office. Dr.
Chester Rowell of Fresno, member of the'
State Senate. Repent of the- State Uni
versity, and a Republican of high char
acter and excellent attainments, is men
tioned for the place. Collector Lynch is
so obnoxious that his reappointment is
out of the question. Much surprise was
expressed when he was appointed to tho
office. He was elected to the Lepislatuie
from San Bernardino County on a pledge
to support George C. Perkins for United
Ftates Senator, but when he grot to Sac
ramento he switched for M. H. de Young.
He was reeommendPd to the California
Congressional delegation by Mr. de i'ouns
and Major Frank MdL.augb.lln. He wa>
not indorsed as a candidate of special fit
ness for the place, but the argument was
advanced that harmony In the Republican
party would be restored if he were given
an office. He has managed somehow dui
ing the three years of his Incumbency to
arouse more wrangling and strife in the
party than was ever before created by a
Federal officeholder in California. He
capped the climax of interference <n af
fairs outside of his office by circulating
at Sacramento what purported to be a
copy of a telegram from United Stated
Senator Perkins requesting 1 members of
the Legislature to support D. M. Burns
for United States Senator. The explana
tions which subsequently satisfied Senator
Perkins have not been given to the pub
lic, but the Senator absolutely denies that
he sent such a message. The purpose
Lynch had in view in circulating the
bogus telegram was to defeat the election
of Senator Bard.
The following inquiry addressed to The
Call Is not untimely:
Mr. Editor: Why can't the Republicans pet
up a grand celebration next week in honor of
our wonderful victory and let all the flags fly
en Thanksgiving day? I had my flag up this
morning at daybreak. I have ajlne 12-foot flaur
on a 27-foot pote on a one-story* cottage and it
Ehows up all right. Yours, etc..
WILLIAM F. PALMER.

The Call fancies that a celebration is
contemplated by the Republican State
Central Committee. At one time yester
day there were at least three persons
other than officers and attaches of the
committee at the official headquarters of

Democrats at the next session of the California Legislature will apparently be as rare as the proverbial hen's teeth.
The count is practically over. Returns are still lacking from a few of the outside districts, but the story has been told.
When the official count Is made public there may be some minor changes in the majorities, but the general result will be
the Â«;ame Republicans will dominate the upper and lower house at Sacramento, nnd there is a Republican Governor to
Ftamp the seal of approval on their official, acts. The battle was fiercely fought, particularly in interior cities. Issues
were presented by the proponents of both parties and the choice left to the people. The result Is concisely told in' thÂ»

Uncle Same Has Some IJeft.
Uncle Sam owns largo tracts of land
in the Southern Statesâ 1,500,000 acres in
Florida, 3,500,000 In Arkansas. 500,000 in
Louisiana and a similar quantity in Mis
sissippi, wnlch, however, Is mostly
swamps. In Michigan 438.000 acres are
still available, and in Wisconsin 313.000
acres. But he is selling off his real es

the largest on record, which seems rather
singular In view of. the prosperity that ex

Knights of the Maccabets.
On the night of the 24th of October State
Commander S. W. Hall paid a visit to
Redding Tent, in the city of that name.
He was tendered a public reception, which
was attended by many visiting knights,
also by the membership of Redding Hive
No. 34 of the Ladies of the Maccabees.
The preceding evening the State com
mander was tendered a reception by Red
Bluff Tent, and on the 25th he was a vis
itor to Dunsmuir Tent, where he was
given a cordial reception.
San Francisco Tent is holding Interest
ing reviews, and from the amount of in
terest that Ihe knights are taking in itÂ«
affairs at this time it looks as if they
were trying to make It the most influential
beneficial subordinate organization of the
city. Candldatrs secured through the ef
fort* of Deputy Supreme Commander
Blake are being initiated at each review.
The tent has appointed several commit
tees who will arrange a number of enter
tainments for the winter months with the
Idea of bringing together the members,
their families and their friends.
THE SAN .-KKAKCISCO CALL, FrIdAY, .: NOVEMBER 9, 1900.
CALIFORNIA has fallen Into line and shown her indorsement of the policy
of President McKinley by giving: him a handsome majority. Gains for
the Republican candidate are shown ir. almost every precinct. There are
r?9 ctlll to hear from, and the party confidently expects that these will
but servfe to swell the Republican majority. An interesting compara

AT la?t popular "Billy" Hyn^s
has listened to the advice of
his friends and will tread the
theatrical hoards *uÂ» a profes
sional comedian. He will be
pln nrxt Bunday afternoon at the Or
phcum a two weeks' engagement In a
monolcpue and topical song specialty.
No amateur Is better known In thjg city
than "Laughing Billy Hyncs." as he is
ever to the front at all performances in
aid of charity. A few weeks ago the Cali
fornia Club gave a benefit at the Orphcum
and Hynes was down on the bill. Hie
managetnr nt of the he use was very favor
ably Impressed -with hi* talent and offered
him an engagement. He was modest about
his abilitleis and it took a great deal of
persuasion by his friends to set him to
accept the offer. He finally compromised
by making arrangements with the pro
prietors of the City of Paris dry goods
house, where Ke is employed as book
)t r, ? rp. e to allow him to stj'.l retain his po
fitlon with the bouse, while he appealed
at the Orpheum. so that at the close of
Us two weeks' v-ork if he should feel that
his success was not assured on the stage
he could 6tl11 return to his old poifion
that he has held with honor to himself for
Â»-evÂ»ral yeare.
John Morrisey stated last night that he
had no doubt cf Hynes' success on the
vaudeville stage. He stated that the Or
pheum has a national reputation and that
a. man who can make a hit at this house
coulJ fill dates at any in the world.
It is more than possible that Hynes*
friends will bÂ« at the matinee to give the
aspiring amateur a warm reception and
make his initial performance as a profes
sional a tremendous hit.

I appreciate this action on your, part all the
more because of the multitudinous details that
require your attention at such a time as the
evening of election day. Â¦ . .
Again thanking you for your kindness in the
matter I remain, yours very truly, .

MBS. SAUNDERS AGREES
TO PAY LANDiLADIES
Motion to Dismiss the Case Against
Her Taktn Under Advisement
by Judge Conlan.
Mrs. Helen ' Saunders, the wealthy
widow of San Rafael, will escape punish
ment for defrauding landladies out of the
board bills for herself and daughter.
When 'the case against her at the in
stance of Mrs. Lizzie K^arns, 1409 Lcaveu
worth street, was called in Judge Conlan's
court yesterday morning Mrs. Kearns said
that Mrs. Saunders had agreed to pay her
bill of $40 and she wanted the case dis
mlsped. Under the circumstances Assist
ant District Attorney Weller made a mo
tion for dismissal as the Penal Code per
mitted such procedure when the amount
In question was paid.
"Of course." said the Judge, "such a
course Is permissible by the code, but 1
want to say that I would certainly have
found the defendant eruMty and woula
have given her the limit. I will continue
the case until Saturday and meantim'
will take the motion to dismiss under
I consideration."
Mrs. Saunders was served with war
rants at the instance of Miss Bessie Still.
9C4 Geary street, and C. E. Stone. Powell
and Sacrampnto streets. She was taken
to the City Prison and booked on the
charges and was at once released on ball.
She had a purse full of gold and it is
presumed settled with Miss Still and Mr.
Stone. Two landladies wanted to get
warrants for her arrest tor defrauding
them ten or eleven years ago. but it was
explained to them that the debts had been
outlawed. She was. known by a different
name at each place.

Mr. Bryan says he has no other plans at
present than to remain at home, Â¦where he
returned from the fatiguing campaign.
He denied the report that he would re
move from Nebraska and make Texas his
home.
"The Republicans were able to secure
tickets or passes for all their voters who
were away from home, and this gave
them considerable advantage. We have
no way of knowing at this time how
much money was spent In the purchase
of votes and in colonization. But while
these would account for some of the Re
publican gains they could not account for
the widespread increase in the Republi
can vote. The prosperity argument was
probably the most potent one used by tnÂ©
Kepublicans. They compared present
conditions with the panic ; times oi : 1893 to
1SSK5. and this argument had weight with
those who did not stop to consider the
reasons for the change. The appeal,
â¢Stand by the President while the war is
on ' had a great deal of influence among
those who did not realize that a war
aginst a doctrine of self-government in
the Philippines must react upon us In this
country. We made an honest ngnt upon
an honest platform, and having done our
duty as we saw tt, we have notning to re-
E1 *^\Ve were defeated, but are not discour
aged. The fight must go on. I am sure
that Republican policies will be repudi
ated by the people when the tendency of
these policies is fully understood. The
contest between plutocracy and Democ
racy cannot end until one or the other is
completely triumphant." . '
Concerning himself Mr. Bryan said: "I
have come out of the campaign with per
fect health and a clear conscience. I did
my utmost to bring success to the prin
ciples for which I stood. Mr. Stevenson
did all that he 'could. Senator Jones and
the members of the Democratic, Populist,
Silver Republican and Anti-Imperialist
committees did all they could. Mr. Hearst
and his associates in the club organiza
tion put forth their best efforts. Our
newspapers, our campaign speakers and
our local organizations all did their best.
I have no fault to find and no reproaches.
I shall continue to take an active interest
in politics as long as I live. I believe It
to be the duty of the citizen to do so. and
in addition to my Interest as a citizen I
feel that it will require a lifetime of work
to repay the political friends who have
done so much for me. I shall not be a
Senatorial candidate before the Legisla
ture which has been elected. Senator Al
len deserves the Senatorshlp which goes
to the Populists. Mr. Hitchcock and Mr.
Â¦\V. H. Thompson are avowed candidates
for the Senatorshlp. They both deserve
well of the party, and I am too grateful
to them for past support to stand In their
way even if I desired a seat 'in the Sen
ate."
LINCOLN, Nebr.. Nov. 8.â "W. J. Bryan
to-night gave out the following statement
concerning the election:
"The result was a surprise to me, and
the magnitude of the Republican victory
was a surprise to our opponents as well
as to those who voted our ticket. It is
impossible to analyze the returns until
they are more complete, 1 but, speaking
generally, we seem to have gained in the
large cities and to have lost in the smaller
cities and in the country.

Says the Prosperity Argu
ment Was Most Potent
Factor.
BRYAN EXPLAINS
WHY HE LOST
Treadwell is still alive, but will die. The
Injured man comes from an excellent fam
ily, but he has associated with evil com
pany and when drunk was very quarrel
some.
As Treadwell hit Booker the third time
both men straightened up and a shot rang
out. Treadwell staggered back and said:
"I am shot!" He then jumped at the ne
gro again and hit him a blow In the face
that knocked him backward over a chair.
Bystanders separated the men. and Tread
well walked up the street to another sa
loon and physicians were summoned.
The cause that led up to the shooting
occurred on election day, when Treadwell
and Booker had a fight over the election.
On this occasion Booker was badly beaten
and swore vengeance on > Treadwell.
This morning Treadwell and a man named"
"Wilkinson entered a Sixth-street saloon.
The negro was sitting at. a card table
asleep. Treadwell went up to him and,
putting his arm around Booker'B neck, hit
the negro with his other hand In the face
several times.

THE CALL'S RACING CHART
"Conductor" McManus is now a layer
of odds. He cut in yesterday under the
name of the Golden Gate Club, with
"Dewy" Andrews as blockman.
Green Morris is not very sweet on Lo
cochee. After considerable deliberation
he sent in a $5 commission on the sulker.
J. K. Hughes, the Texas horseman,
reached Ingleside track yesterday from
St. Louis with a carload of racing mate
rial. Ihe Light. Charlotte M and La
Mascotta are three members of the string.
Pedro Enos was set down for the bal
ance of the meeting because of his care
less ride on Horton. "Daggle" Smith had
a good-sized bet on his horse, but was
, convinced that only overconfidence on the
( part of Pedro lost the race.
The officials at Oakland have decided
that Atkin & Lottridge are entitled to
the services of Jockey Coburn. The boy
contended that he had never received any
money for his work, but the firm showed
a voucher where a sum had been paid
him and an acknowledgment of same,
signed by the rider"s brother. The latter
signature was also disputed, but it proved
to be genuine.
Sam Hlldreth sent in a big commission
on Rolling Boer and nearly every book in
the ring lost to the race.
With Mounce or any strong finisher on
the back of Morinel. the mare would have
disposed of Malay quite handily. Stuart,
who did pilot her, could do better when he
had been galloping horses only six weeks.
Al Konigsberg, who is hiying odds in
the ring, was $1000 loser up to the last
race. He spread enough about on Rolling
Boer to win $2000, and more than Dulled
out. Fred Cook laid him $1000 to $500.
â¢ Bookmaker Joe Rose will be here in a
couple of weeks. He has been promised a
rehearing, it is said, by the California
Jockey. Cub. /
Roundhead, a starter in the first race,
is said to have shown some fast morning
workouts. Either he is a morning glory
or his pilots have been giving him some
sloppy rides. Dominick took a trick at
at the wheel yesterday and ius price went
from 5 to 2 to 5 to 1.
A voting contest to determine the most
popular jockey is in progress at Father
Coyle's church fair. Native Sons' Hall, on
Mason street. A handsome diamond ring
is offered as the prize, and to date Bull
man leads his brother riders.

Seventeen bookmakers weighed in at
j yesterday's drawing. With the election a
! thing of the past business picked up no
' ticeably, and no complaint was heard of
' lack of play.
I Gus Miller, the St. Louis pencller, after
; three days on the block, concluded to
I study the angles of the fame from the
! ground for a time.
Track Nvtes.
Â¦- EKOS caused many latn-
I ~j entatluns and much gnashing
I ' of teeth by an exhibition of
I_ Kro?s carelessness in the third
event at Oakland track yester
day Pedro, "who has been riding on the
St. Ixjuis and Chicago tracks the past
summer, evidently thought he had learned
a thing or two. He had the leg up on
llorton. an ev.-n money favorite, and dur
ing the first stages of the journey con
cluded to take a nap. The bell boy forgot
to rail -him and Pedro awoke in time to
see fampns. Â« 30 to 1 shot, with Jimmy
lyogue in the Pilot house, beat his mount
across the line a nose. It was a horrify
ing spectacle to the backers of "Daggle"'
Smiths little red horse, and after ques
tioning Er.os and examining the sheets,
the judges let the rider off with a lecture
ami a brief vacation on the ground.
While the traÂ«k was inclined to be
Etlckyand holding, with two exceptions the
tilrnt picked ihe right horses, and most
of the books retired with lightened bank
rolls. Some excdlrnt sport was wit
nessed, the finishes being close and excit-
The performance of Rolling Boer in the
final sprint of the day-the Solano handi
capâearned fresh laurels for Billy Ca
hillB sturdy looking colt. He was asked
to carry 114 pound? and down an all aged
field the best of the assortment being Pat
MorriRFcy witn 115 and Hungarian with
US Canmore. a i'-yoar-old from Walter
Jennings' stablÂ« . was an unknown quan
tity with 101 on his back, but the books
took no liberties with him. Pat Morrifsey
opened an even money chance, but when
a heavy play cut the price against the
Poer from threes to S to 5. Pat's odds
drifted to the same figure. Pat Morrissey*
never cut a figure in the race, the weights
and going anchoring him. Canmore set a
ragtime clip and Bullman had to sit down
hard on lioer to get up and win by half
a length.
Owner Jimmy Coffey took the opening
scramble for maiden 2-year-olds, with
Galanthus. riiden by Johnny Woods.
Nine to flve was the best laid, and the
gelding won from Litmus and Cambaceres
without effort.
A ding-dong finish between Johnny
Ransrh on Kickumbob and Jack Martin
astride The Buffoon marked the close of
the second number, a mile run. Ransch
more than heKI his own, getting the decis
ion by a head. The winner was 4 to 1 in
the letting. Locochee, the favorite, ran
into show.
Little Dominick piloted Malay to vic
tory in the Emeryville handicap, at one
mile and a sixteenth. Dr. Rowell's horse
ruled favorite in the ring, and after
Grand Sachem had led to the stretch
Dominick picked up the running with
Malay. Then stalling off a well meant
rush of Stuart astride Morinel, he breast
ed the tape wini.er by a head.
Carrying but 107 pounds on her back. 7
to 5 looked a good price against Torsina
in the speculation on the seven-furlong
selling affair. Third to the bend for home.
Stuart there gave the mare her head,
when she gradually wore down the lead
of Good Hope and scored by a head. The
Bobby finished third.

KIND WORDS FOR THE GALL.
The thanks of all people, irrespective of party, should be tendered the San
Francisco Call for its fearless and splendid fight against bosses and corruDt
politicians. The Call's work in behalf of Metcalf and Belshaw is very irrati
fying to the people of Contra Costa, and we watch with interest any other
fight it is making. The. Call is a good, clean paper.; and fit for our children
and does not bring, the blush' of shame to the cheeks of decent people. "Well
done. Call; keep up the good work. â¢ .

Betire Them Now.
Whoever consults an Army Register will
discover that every colonel on the list Is
a veteran of the Civil War, and one-third
of them were in the army before 1S60.
More than half of the lieutenant colonels
and majors fought in the Civil War. Most
of them, perhaps all, have had years of
hardships in Indian campaigns. These
men are nearing the age of compulsory
retirement. Many of them are great suf
ferers and perform such service as is re
quired with all the fidelity of true soldiers
but without the vigor and dash of younger
men, which is now impossible for | them
They hang on, hoping for another promo"
tion that will enable them to gain a lit
tle larger retiring pay for the solace of
their later years. "Why should not a rich
and grateful nation, which bestows pen
sions with lavish hand on privates who
served but a few months in the Civil War
give to these gray and weary veterans the
boon of retirement with their coveted pro
motion at once? It would cost but llttlÂ»
They deserve such consideration and irrat"
uity, no, not gratuity but earned honor
and reward. It would bring into com
mand of our regiments and battalions
younger men, full of vigor and ambition
the consequence of which would be In
creased efficiency and new llfe.-Boston

t The, Michigan, aspirant for office who killed him

And now Switzerland wants to borrowVseveral.mil

Reports, founded in the" gravest suspicion and
based upon ugly facts, point again to the head of the
law department of the Southern Pacific Company as
a disbursing agent of political corruption. IHs to
be hoped that the new directors of the corporation
will learn enough of our politics to be wise enough
to mind their own business.
China has overcome its objections, it appears/ to
the desecration of its graveyards and will permit, the
building of railroads. The^ oriental powers that bo
have evidently reached the conclusion that it is better
to have a few railroads rather than many graveyards
made by' aggressive foreigners.
The Board of Supervisors' seems to be honestly
moved by a purpose to check the adulteration of

direction by commanding the Board -of Health to
enforce the laws already in existence but notoriously

The grief with which the patrolmen of the Police

Commercial Education.
The city of London, having already dona
valuable work for technical eaucatlon. Isi
about to direct its attention to thÂ» sub
ject of commercial education. A special
court of the corporation convened recent
ly to consider a scheme which will prob
ably involve an expenditure of a quarter
of a million sterling. It Is pr<jposÂ«d to
found a great school where youths -who
have chosen a commercial career will bo
taught the technicalities of the branch
they have selected. In such a school It
will not be possible to make thÂ© fees very
low but it is hoped the case of youths
who are not able to pay the fees will ba
met by scholarship?.â Cardiff Mall.
I I ARDLY any feature of the elections in this
j I State is more gratifying than that which reveals
the careful discrimination exercised by the peo
ple in supporting Republican candidates. Where
such candidates were thoroughly representative of
the principles of the party they were almost without
exception elected by good majorities, but where the
bosses had succeeded^in nominating notorious rail
road tools on the Republican ticket self-respecting 1
people refused to be - supporters of such men, and
most of them were defeated. *
The circumstances under which the bosses were
beaten adds to the satisfaction with which the victory
for honest politics will be regarded. The trend of
public sentiment was so overwhelmingly Republican
that every candidate who had a place on the Repub
lican ticket had an immense advantage over his oppo
nent. Moreover, W. F. Herrin, who in times past
had never shown himself openly in supporting rail
road candidates and opposing honest men, came out
publicly in this campaign, and by bringing Kelly and
Crimmins to the front as political leaders made him
self a partner with them in the fight. Thus the defeat
of those candidates demonstrates that the intelligence
of the Republican voters of San Francisco will not
tolerate "yellow dogs" even in such tidal wave years
as this, and that the Southern Pacific Company has
no longer the strength in local politics it once had. â¢ \
The fight made by Herrin, Crimmins and Kelly'
was directed mainly to the election of Dibble and the
defeat of Bclshaw. No man in either branch of the
Legislature has ever been more compliant or more,
unscrupulous in service to the railroad than Dibble,
and no man has ever stood against them more firmly
in the interests of the people and of honesty than
Bclsha-.v. Therefore Herrin spared no expense of
time, eriergy* or money to elect the one and defeat the
other. All his efforts were vain. The victory of the
people was decisive. Dibble was beaten. Belshaw
was elected.
This demonstration of the clearness with which a
majority of the voters of the State discriminate be
tween genuine Republicanism and the. spurious poli
tics which the railroad and v the .bosses undertake. to.
carry out under the name of Republicanism comes at
a most opportune time. The-Southern \PacificÂ»iV in
the hands ot new managers. The newly chosen presi
dent, Mr. Hays,' will tre long enter upon the work of
his office. When he reaches California he vvilP he
confronted with this evidence of the alliance between
Herrin and # the ward bosses of San Francisco to do
"crooked politics j" an'd he will also perceive how far
that alliance is antagonistic to the sentiment and the
interests of the people v It is hardly likely lie will ig
nore the lesson. '
The people of California are sure to, derive a great
profit from the discrimination they have exercised.
They have rid . the Legislature of the presence j of .
Dibble as a member of the Assembly. If he go to
Sacramento to do politics he will have to go as a
lobbyist. They have by indorsing Mr. Belshaw given
encouragement to ..every- honest legislator. Finally |"
theyiiave brought about a situation which will in all
likelihood lead the. new managers of the Southern
Pacific to either remove Herrin from office or at least
compel him to attend to the legitimate business of
THE DEFEAT OF TriE BOSSES.
A CHANCE FOR DEMOCRACY.
ON the day after the great and' glorious election
an old dyed-in-the-wool Democrat was heard
bewailing the fate that in his imagination
awaited him and his. "After imperialism," said he,
"will come militarism. Then there will be a suppres
sion of everything in the country that opposes the ad
ministration. Democracy, if it exist at all, will have
to be a secret order. It will no longer be tolerated
in the open."
While there'is nothing in the situation to justify
fears of militarism, there is enough to. sustain the con
clusion that as a political organization Democracy
is no longer of any value. There is no need to make
it a secret order, but if it is to survive at all it will
have to be converted to other uses than that of nomi
nating candidates for the Presidency and drawing up
platforms. It can hardly be conducted as a fraternal
association just at present, for there is too little
brotherly love among the few voters who remain in
it; nor can it be made a glee club or musical society,
for it has at present no inclination to melody. The
laws will not permit it to operate as an athletic club
for the promotion of prize-fights, and no other kind
of athletics would be pleasing to its members in their
gloom. There remains a plan of making it a pic
nic association, and that plan merits consideration.
-By arranging a series of picnics held far- from the
madding crowd Democracy could still be. of some
service to the State. For example, in this city it
might take Phelan out for a frolic and either lose him
in the woods or drop him in the bay. A national
frolic of a similar nature would give a chance to lose
Bryan, Altgeld and others. Services of that kind
would be appreciated. All discussions of Democratic
reorganization should take the picnic club idea into
consideration. It will be a great deal* better than
making a secret society out of the thing, or. trying to
run it any more as a political machine.
AN ErtVASCULATED/ CODE.
/
THE report of the commission for the "revision
and reform of tlie law," with recommendations
respecting the Code of Civil Procedure, which
has just been printed for the edification- of the legal
profession, is less valuable, if such a thing is possible,
than any "report" of any previous commission with
respect to any code. Not but what the work done
by the honorab'e gentlemen ;vho comprise the body
upon the Code of Civil Procedure discovers the pos
sessioiT of great intellectual powers and eminent abil
ity; the main difficulty with the report is that it is
too powerful and too able.
The Commissioners recommended the repeal or
amendment of one-fourth qi the present code. This
2lone lays the foundation for the publication of fifty
volumes of Supreme Court reports and for at least
two thousand contests over disputed questions of
practice. The cost of these volumes and these con
tests would easily approximate one million dollars.
Among the changes proposed with reference to the
partition of real property the commission abolishes
the only remedy now existing for perfecting the title
to land against which there are claims of unknown
owners, and in disqualifying a Judge from acting in
proceedings for contempt when he is the aggrieved
party it places every court at' the mercy of the bullies
and braggarts of the bÂ»r. In dispensing with the pres
ent requirement in probate cases that heirs in the
State shall be notified of applicat'ons for letters the
commission abolishes the only means many persons
have of learning that their interests are unprotected.
and in denying to individuals to whom claims have
been assigned the right to sue for them it cuts off a
privilege now enjoyed by many poor people who havs
just causes but not the money to prosecute them.
In revising and refoiming the law this commission,
like its predecessor?, has attempted too much. Two
thirds of all the cases which are now appealed to the
Supreme Court involve questions of practice. Of the
127 volumes comprising the California Reports more
than half have been devoted to explaining, applying
and correcting the provisions of the Code of Civil
Procedure. Why rip up all this work and begin
anew? Will the time ever come when the lawyers
will cease to practice on their clients by raising and
disputing questions of procedure?
The Commission for the Revision and Reform of
the Law consists of A. C. Freeman, \V. C. Van Fleet
and Georpe J. Denis, with \V. F. Henning, a Los
Angeles writer of. law, as secretary.-. We hope it will
he established later on that Messrs. Freeman and Van
Fleet have had nothing to do with this revolutionary
attempt to "revise" and "reform" the Code of Civil
Procedure. Both are gentlemen of sense and ability,
and their innocence would leave the awful burden of
guilt to fall upon Governor Gage's Commissioner
and Secretary. As the latter have probably drawn
their salaries ss soon as due, and torn up all the sta
tionery available, they may be better able to bear the
responsibility than their older and more diffident col
leagues. In any event we shall never believe Free
man and Van Fleet r-re particeps criminis until the
fact is proved by trustworthy evidence in a court of
It has been the practice of Legislative Judiciary
Committees heretofore to throw the work of all Com
missioners appointed to "revise" and "reform" thÂ«
laws into convenient wastebaskets. That fate will
doubtless in due time overtake the work of this one.
In the meantime it may be well for the taxpayers to
consider how much thi> biennial monkeying with the
codes is costing them. The Commissioners draw
each $4000 annually and their secretary $2400. Thev
have a clerk and stenographer, who destroy alage
quantity of official stationery every year. Their exist
ence was authorized by a statute passed in 1895. So
up to date they have cost the treasury- nearly $100,000,
which does not include tlie expense of printing their
Vet it never seems to occur to anybody to suggest
the abolition of th'e commission. \Vi[l California a
hundred years hence still be in the .business of revis
ing and reforming its laws through the legislative
wastebasket at a cost of $20,ooo annually?
EMPEROR WILLIAM'S recent visit to Barmen and Elberfeld was connected
with the opening, not only of a hall of fame conceived on a plan somewhat
similar to that which Is shortly to grace University Heights, but also of
a railroad which Is the first of its kind to be put into practical operation.
At once a one rail and a suspended railway, the line runs from Voh
winkle to Elberfeld and Barmen, the two latter towns being centers of great In
dustrial activity, with an aggregate population of a quarter of a million. The
distance is a little over eight miles, and for a greater part of this the track is
above the Rlv^r Wupper. The carriages travel literally hanging from a single
rail running exactly above the center line of the roof. These carriages each have
two pairs of bicycle bogle wheels, one at each end of the roof, from which the
whole car depends. The wheels have electric motor attachments, which develop
energy sent along a second rail in the usual manner, and support the car by
means of stout hooked bars, which bend from the wheel axle round one side of
the rail, and fix Into huge steel eyes projecting from the middle line of the car's
roof. The railroad itself, consisting of two distinct linesâ for up and down traffic
âIs rigidly held by cross girder work. The whole superstructure is supported at a
suitable height above road and river traffic by A and O shaped trestles, the ends
of which rest in masonry foundations at either side of the way.
The designed maximum speed of the railway is only thirty-six miles an hour,
but it should be noted that curves and gradients are many. There are nineteen
stations on tho% stretch of eight miles between the termini. Inclusive of stop
pages at each of these, trains will take twenty minutes for the whole Journey.
Trains on this upside-down railway travel smoothly, with very little vibration and
practically no noise. They are amply provided with brakes and usual safety ap
pliances, and by a somewhat novel provision regulate the signals automatically.
Â¦Herr Engene Langen of Cologne was the originator of the "hanging" railway,
but in a trial stretch of line which he built at Cologne In 1S93 the cars were sup
ported by double sets of wheels running on two lines. The Inventor subsequent
ly died, befors seeing his system put to practical use. The original idea was
improved and modified to the monorail system by engineering firms in Nurem
burg and Augsburg, to whom the work of erection was intrusted. In 1S95 a
trial section of the monorail suspension system was put up in Cologne, and this
was found to be bo eminently satisfactory that the sister towns of Elberfeld
and Barmen* entered upon negotiations for the construction of a line. Building
was commenced In the spring of 1S9S.

Thanks are the orders ot the day at present, hence it Is only proper to say
that the teachers of this city fully recoginze and appreciate the value of
the services of The Call in its loyal support of Senate Amendment No. 15.
The Call was, I believe- the only morning paper that supported the
amendment. It received the highest vote of the whole number of amend
ments, excepting the Stanford measure, for which we all voted, of course.

THE PAYMENT OF CUSTOMS.
AERCHANTS doing business in New York
have long enjoyed the privilege of paying
customs duties by bank certificates, and as i
consequence * their importers are able to liquidate
duties at the Custom-house without carrying the very
large sums of money involved through the streets in
cash. The advantages of the privilege are many, anÂ«l
it is gratifying that the Merchants' Association of this
city has begun a movement to obtain a similar-privi
lege for importers here.' " ' v "" ..
In order that the "plan "may bVclearly understood
by those interested, the association has obtained from
New York full information concerning the practical
operation of the system in that city. Copies of the
letter and documents containing the information
have been sent to the banks and. to the leading com
mercial houses of the city itiviting co-operation in the
undertaking. In a circular letter pointing out the de
sirability of the privilege the directors of the associa
tion say: "We believe .that it only requires the. fa
vorable consent of the* commercial banks of the city
to make successful a petition to the Treasury De
partment for the extension of this privilege to San
Francisco." Such being .the 'case it is' to be hoped
the banks will cordially respond -,to the movement.-
In describing the method of procedure in that city
the letter from the Merchants' Association of New
York says: "Any bank in this city which is a mem
ber of 'the clearing-house may make a deposit at the
sub-treasury at its opening In the morning of such
sum as it deems best, for which it receives from the
sub-treasury a certificate of deposit,, in duplicate, cov
ering the amount. ' This certificate shows 1 , that the
amount deposited is to be applied in payment of cus
toms duties. One of the certificates is retained by the
bank, the other being imme'diately sent by it to the
Collector of the Port. Any client of that bank who
has occasion to make payment of duties during the
day can go to the bank and obtain from it a certifi
cate directed to the Collector of the Port for the sum
which he has to pay. The client takes the certificate
to the Collector, who receives the same as so much
cash. At the end of the day the Collector sends all
these certificates, together with a summary thereof, to
the sub-treasury, with the request that the balance of
the sum total deposited by the banks be distributed.
Thereupon the sub-treasury returns to each bank,
generally through the clearing-house, a check for
such balance as remains after deducting the customs
duties paid during the day. In this way eath day's
transactions are completed that day. The same process
is repeated day after day."
It will be seen from the summary of the working
of the system that the plan is not onerous to the
banks, is perfectly safe for the Government and is of
great benefit to' merchants. It is stated that in New-
York the customs duties average $500,000 daily, an.l
the advantage of a plan which enables merchants to
avoid carrying that sum through. the 'streets every
day is too apparent to need explanation.
The import business of San Francisco is bound to
increase rapidly with the expansion of oriental trade,
and it is therefore timely for our merchants to obtain
air the privileges which assist in facilitating the busi
ness.

the road hereafter and quit slum politics. Over such
results. there is good leason to feel the highest grati
fication.
\A ANY times has The Call demonstrated * -by
/ \ some striking achievement of newsgatherinij
* the difference between legitimate.journalism
and that fake journalism which does not gather news
but substitutes for it any kind of a story that will fill
space without much cost and please people who de
light in being fooled. Rarely, however, has it ever
made a more striking demonstration of that contrast
than by. collecting information upon which to base
a forecast of the result of the elections which have just
taken place.
It will be remembered that the Call and the New
York Herald "made a careful study of the trend of
public sentiment in all the States, and on October 21
The Callpublished the result of the investigation. It
gave a table showing the probable vote of every State
in the Union. Some of the States, Illinois, Indiana
and Kansas, were then considered doubtful. The
Call placed every one of those States as sure for Me-
Kinley. The result shows they were so. In fact, The
Call correctly forecast the vÂ©te of every State,
whether considered doubtful or not. Nor was the
forecast confined to the Presidential ticket. The Con
gressional elections were calculated with an almost
equal accuracy, and despite all claims that the Demo
crats would control the House of Representatives, the
forecast gave a Republican majority in that branch
of the Government which tallies very closely with the
results thus far made known.
By way of contrast with the correctness of the es
timates of The Call made October 21 the public
should note the forecast published in the Examiner
of October 29, a week later. The Examiner claimed
as sure for Bryan 197 electoral votes, including among
them those of West Virginia, Kansas, Wyoming,
South Dakota and Maryland, which The Call had
placed a week before in the McKinley column, and
which voted as The Call predicted. Furthermore, the
Examiner placed as doubtful New York, Delaware,
North Dakota, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, California,
Washington. Each of those States The Call
had forecast as being sure for McKinley, and in that
respect also The Call has been proven right and the
' Examiner wrong.
The wide difference in the results of the two calcu
lations is due to the difference in the methods by
which the calculations were made. The Call, aided
by the Herald, gathered news; the Examiner faked
a report and published it as news. For the purpose,
of obtaining correct information there were employed
by The Call and the Herald careful and reliable stu
dents of political affairs in every doubtful State and
Congressional district. The information thus ob
tained was worth something. It gave the people a
comprehensive idea of the whole situation, and from
an American standpoint was the* most valuable news
item of the day on which it was published. The fake
estimate of the yellow journal cost nothing and was
worth nothing..
Finally, it is to be noted that Bryan lost this year
the one vote he had in California four years ago, the
ten he had in Kansas, the four he had in South Da
kota, the four jn West Virginia and the three in Wyo
ming. On the other hand he will probably gain
twelve votes in Kentucky, where the election is in
doubt, but which gave that many votes to McKinley
in 1806. Each of these gains and losses was forecast
by The Call. In short, our tables gave McKinley 281
votes in the Electoral College and Bryan 166. In
cluded -in the Bryan column were Idaho, Kentucky
and Nebraska, whose vote is still in doubt. Should
one of these States prove to be for McKinley it would
be the only error in the calculations made and pub
lished two weeks before the elections. Such accuracy
of estimates proves the thoroughness of the news-
. gathering upon which they were based, and demon
strates the reliability of the news service The Call
gives the public.

"Upon April 11, 1893. I bought from C. j
W. Morse 5000 shares of the stock of the '
American Ice Company for $250,000. which
was the face market value thereof, of [
which sum I paid 150.000 in cash by three j
checks and I gave three promissory notes I
for the balance, one for Â§50,000 and two for j
$75,000 each. The stock was issued to me
and by me delivered to Mr. Morse as col
lateral security for the notes. Subse
quently the notes and collateral were
transferred to certain banks.
"They were renewed from time to time,
the interest being paid by me. Finally
the notes were paid in full by me, with
Interest, out of the proceeds of the stock
as hereinafter stated. I had been a stock
holder in the Knickerbocker Ice Company
of Maine long previous to April 11. 1899,
and had paid for my stock therein $45,
000, which was* the face market value
thereof. I received a printed circular
about May, 1899, from the American Ice
Company, offering to exchange their stock
share for share for Knickerbocker stock,
and I made such exchange. My entire
holdings of ice stock have been sold in
the open market on the New York .Stock
Exchange in various lots for $281,219 15. I
paid for the stock $295,000."
The Mayor says that he did not know
that the company had dealings with the
city, as the contracts were made by
boards; that as soon as he became aware
of such contracts he protested. The May
or cites previous Instances where former
Mayors were stockholders in banks where
city moneys were on deposit, and calls at
tention to the opinion of Judge Dillon that
stockholding is not illegal.
In answer to all charges he says that
each and every one of the charges Is ab
solutely and unqualifiedly false. He
claims that there never was any arrange
ment, combination, understanding or con
spiracy to procure his official, political
or individual influence or assistance for
the benefit of the American Ice Company
or its friends, or for the benefit of any
other ice company. In regard to the ad
vance in the price of thirty to sixty cents
per hundred pounds, he says that he was
not in any way connected therewith or
cognizant thereof, and that he did not
know of the advance until he saw it In
the newspapers.

JCEW YORK. Nov. 8.â New York's Four
Hundred were shocked to-day at the reve
lations concerning two of their members,
Mr. and Mrs. Howard Gould.
More testimony was taken in the case
cf Frank L>. Mowbray, former valet of
Mr. Gould, who sues to recover (25,003
damages for the lostrof an eye caused by
l>rÂ«-mature explosion of a skyrocket
aboard Gould's yacht.
The testimony to-day was rich and racy.
The former valet testified that he object
ed to waiting on Mr. Gould in a London
house when Miss Clemmons was there. _
"1 had to take meals to the bedroom,
he said. "I objected to this as it was de
grading, and Mr. Gould taid that 1 was
his valet, that other servants did not
know, and that he felt he could trust me,
while ae couldn't trust others."
Mowbray said that in the spring of 1S36
while Miss Clemmons was reading in
Wett Seventy-second street. New icrk,
Mr. Gould sent him with some money to
the house. He had some words with Miss
Clemmons then.
"1 told Mr. Gould that Miss Clemmons
had threatened to have me discharged,
paid Mowbray, "because I had been too
friendly with her maid, Rose, and be
cause I knew loo much about her busi
ness. Mr. Gould told me to pay no at
tention to It." . ,
"What occurred about the shampooing
incident?" ,, .

Mowbray testillcd that, while he drank
liquor moderately, he had never been in

hr.w it haprened that he went aboard the
Atalanta dripping wet while at Cowes, he

â¢'We had a lot of bappage and three or

pounds, got in and It upset. We all fell
into the water and we had a great time

The deposition of William Robert Pitt,
who was second steward on the yacht of
Mr. GouM, was read In evidence. It was

THE f team launch Bacillus of the
Federal Quarantine Service, was
wrecked on Pinnacle Rock, off
the west side of Angel Island,
Wednesday afternoon and sank
in ten feet of water. William Barker; the
engineer, and Nicholas Paulson, apilot.
the only two men aboard, were taken off
by the steamer Gold, but Paulson had his
left leg so badly crushed that he will
probably die of the injury.
The launch was returning to the Angel
Island wharf after a trip to Meiggs
wharf. It was about 4 o'clock and there
was very little fog on the bay. Paulson,
who is In the employ of the quarantine
fctivice. knew that part of the bay thor
oughly, but apparently through the fail
ure to exercise proper care in steering his
course, the launch struck the rock and
{-â¢tuck on a sunken ledge hard and fast.
The encine was reversed in an attempt
to back off the ledge, but the launch could
not be moved. Distress signals attracted
the attention of the crew of the steanier
Gold, which plies between San Francisco
and retaJuma, and that vessel went to the
!< TheÂ° Bacillus was leaking but Httle. A
hawser was attached to the launch and
the Gold backed away, pulling the smaller
vessel off the rocks. The Bacillus slipped
free of the ledge with little trouole and
tlie Gold attempted to go alongside or her
to take the men off, as it was feared that
the launch would fill and sink. In the
attempt the Bacillus was struck and
thrown over so far on Its side that the
water rushed In at -De cabin windows.
The little vessel filled rapidly and began to
sink. â Â¦'
In the hurry to get the two men off be
fore the launch went down, the acclde-nt
occurred which may cost the life of Paul
son. Barker was taken off safely, but the
tide swung the sinking launch and the
steamer together and Paulson's leg was
caught between them and crushed almost
to a pulp. The pilot was got aboard with
much difficulty and was taken to the
quarantine station.
The Bacillus lies on Its side in ten feet
of water. It is believed that the hull is
damaged but little. The launch will doubt
less be righted and brought to the sur
face.

"Water Front Notes.
The Santa Fe's new ferryboat San Pablo
was unable to enter its slip at the ferry
depot last evening at 7 o'clock on account
of the low tide. It ran into the mud and
had considerable difficulty in backing ofr.
After about twenty minutes' delay the
boat grot clear and docked at the Sausa
lito Blip.
The removal of the lightship has made
lots of trouble. The captain of the Olga
blames it for the loss of his ship. The
captain of the City of Puebla says it de
layed his arrival by five hours. The cap
ta'in of the Mineola says he would have

"Silence!'.' said the usher at Bow-street
upon hearing somebody say, "Well, what
about it? t It's all right." Then came thS
words: Its a glorious day, ain't it."
Silence, repeated the usher, looking
round the court for the offender, but no
one' seemed to have spoken. "I think
there are workmen above." said Mr. de
Rutzen, looking up at the glass roof of
the court. He was right, it was the voice
of the painters that nad been heard.â
London Chronicle.
The Civil Service Commissioners adopt
ed a resolution yesterday canceling the
examination for painters held on August
17 and ordering a new examination on
December 28. The Board of Examiners
appointed by the commission was unable
to agree upon a uniform marking of the
examination papers and it was Impossible
to grade the applicants properly. Those

on the west side of the lake the route will
be over ground almost as level as a floor
from a little beyond the water's edge di

bridge carpenter, who was killed in an
accident near Ripon on November 6, re
turned a verdict yesterday "holding the

knocked off the trestle by the giving way
of a derrick carelessly handled by the

DOMESTTC TROUBLES
CAUSED HIS SUICIDE
Julius Berenson Ends His Life With
Carbolic Acid While in a Lodg-
- ing House.
Julius Berenson, a tailor 25 years of age,
ended his life by drinking carbolic acid
in the Saratoga House at IIS Sixth street.
Domestic troubles caused the man's rash
act. He had had considerable trouble
with his wife, and when a separation was
Imminent the blow was too great for him
to bear.
Berenson was married about four years
ago. He resided at 2213 Taylor street. In
felicity commenced early in his married
life, and recently matters came to a cli
max and a. divorce suit was spoken of.
The husband received a note "Wednesday
from his wife saying that she was going
to work for herself and that he would be
no longer welcome in her presence. He
went to the Saratoga House and secured
a room soon after 1 o'clock yesterday
morning. The bedmaker could receive no
response when he knocked at his door in
the afternoon, and upon investigation
Berenson was found dead in his bed. with
two empty carbolic acid bottles besidÂ©
him.
On a table close to the corpse were two
letters. One was addressed to Mrs. Beren
son. The other was to Samuel Nebren, a
butcher at Howard and Ross streets, and
a cousin of the suicide.
The body was taken to the Morgue by
Deputies Flynn and Smith, where an in
quest will be held. Berenson's mother re
sides In Boston.

recently for threatening and annoying his
wife. He was arrested on the warrant.
MR. ROBSON'S IS A
BADI/T ACTED FARCE
"She Stoops to Conquer" but an Ex
tract From Goldsmith's
Play.
Mr. Robson has been advertising that
he would present Goldsmith's delightful
comedy, "She Stoops to Conquer." What
he really gave us last, night was only a
mangled farce which had better have
been entitled "Tony the Lout Up-to-
Date." For the first ten minutes after the
curtain rose I thought I must have
strayed Into the wrong theater, for the
opening dialogue In Mr. Robson's farce I
found to be not written by Goldsmith,
but by eome person unknown, who mis
takes vulgarity for wit. After the as
sembled Hodges had, finished their stupid
tale the play proper began with what is
really the second scene of act one. This
inversion entirely ruins the development
of the action, which Goldsmith has ar
ranged in a manner that Mr. Robson is
quite Incapable of improving on.
When we did get Goldsmith's first scene
we found It cut up, boiled down and torn
all to pieces. Coming where It did. It lost
all point and relevancy.
Mr. Robson set his fellow actors the bad
example of introducing gags and all man
ner of Irrelevant horse play. With such
an exemplar they can hardly be blamed
for doing even worse than he did. Mr.
Weaver was the only one who preserved
the spirit of the comedy; Mr. Grattan
was absolutely the worst Marlowe I have
ever seen. Such meaningless laughter and
such purposeless rushlngs around the
stage! Has nobody ever told him that re
pose of manner was the most obvious
trait of an eighteenth century gentleman?
Of the ladles. Miss Mortimer was the
only one who knew her part, and the re
sult was Just what might have been ex
pected from such evident lack of prepara
tion. . Â¦
Taken on the whole, the performance
was Ill-considered, ineffective and disap
pointing. Thus to ruin a masterpiece Is
little less than criminal. '

Kenneth N. Jackson, an attorney for
one of the Andersons, defendant claim
holders in the principal suits, was exam
ined first. His testimony went to ehow
that Dudley Dubois had announced pub
licly that he had advised McKenzie to dis
regard the writs of supersedeas. He also
Kenzle, advised his client that the writ
of supersedeas from the Court of Appeals
was not valid and that therefore it need
not be obeyed. When the order for the
arrest of McKenzie went to Nome there
went with it an order summoning Dubois
to appear and show cause why he should
not be punished for contempt for having
advised against the writ of the court. The
order was not obeyed, and the proceed
ings yesterday were to prove his contempt
and have an order for his arrest Issued.

BKFTJSES TO VOUCH FOB
DEAD HUSBAND'S WILL
The will of John Brown, who died In thÂ«
Napa Insane .Asylum on August 6 last,
was filed for probate yesterday. Brown
was committed to the asylum in May of
this year, and although the will bears
date of February 19. 1S98, having been
executed more than two years prior to
his commitment, in the petition accom
panying the will Mary A. Brown, dece
dent's widow, says she will not vouch for
the testament, and. In fact, believes that
her husband was insane when the will
was executed.
Decedent's estate, which is valued at
$10,000, is devised to the testator's widow
and children, Mrs. Sarah Jane Walker
and William C Brown. The will Is wit
nessed by George T. Hat ton. .Â»ylett R.
Cotton and Aylett R. Cotton Jr.
The will of John Hammond, who dieÂ«i
October 30 last, leaving an estate exceed
ing $10,000 In value, was also filed for pro
bate. Decedent bequeaths one-half of his
estate to his widow. Mary E. Hammond,
and the residue In equal shares to his
children, Martton B-. Effle I. and Mabel
H. Hammond.
By the terms of the will of the late Louis
Schallich an estate valued at $5000 is be
queathed to his widow. Sophia Schallich.
Joseph Vincent de Laveaga has applied
for letters â¢ of administration upon the
$40,000 estate of his deceased mother, Ma
rie de Laveagu. Decedent's heirs at law
are the petitioner, a son: Miguel A. dÂ»
Laveaga. her husband: Julia de Laveaga,
a daughter, and Edward I. J. de La
veaga, a son.
would be a great hardship upon him and
particularly for some of his clients for
whose interests hÂ« 1? caring, and he hoped
the proceedings could be laid over until
next year anyway. He said he would ad
vise McKenzie that the writs should be
obeyed, and Geary also said he would ad
vise McKenzie to the same effect, but
nevertheless the miners had to break open
the boxes and the vault to get their gold.
The reason assigned by Dubois. for the
invalidity of the writs was that they were
signed by Judge Morrow only, and that
he was but one of the three Judges; also
that the Court of Appeals had no juris
diction.
McKenzie was admitted to ball in the
sum of $5000 yesterday mornlr.g. His case
will not be taken up until the- first Mon
day In December at the earliest, to which
time the Court, of Appeals has adjourned.
In the case of Dubois, if the testimony is
held sufficient to show contempt, he will
probably be brought out of Noma over
land.
Thomas Geary and Mr. Gunn represent
ed McKenzie and E. S. Pillsbury, Sam
Knight and W. H. Metson represented the
miners In court yesterday.'
to the military authorities. McKenzie al
ways declared he would follow the advice
of his attorneys, and he continued to dis
regard the writs. As an excuse for his
course he said he had been advised that
the writs were not good, not valid, and it
was not proper for him or for his to turn
over the gold dust. The mine owners had
in the meantime taken possession of the
mines by force, and they were fighting to
eecure the gold dust that the receiver nad
taken from them.
When the second writs arrived, the writs
ordering the arrest of McKenzie for con
tempt, the marshals who took the writs
to Nome took forcible possession of the
pold, breaking open the boxes in which
it was stored. They did this after Woods,
the United States EUstrict Attorney, had
refused to deliver up the keys. Metson
said he understood tnat the District At
torney was in Geary's office when he re
fused to give up the keys, but Metson did
not know if Geary was present also.
After the writs of arrest had arrived
MetBon had a conversation with Dubois,
in which Dubois said he had made a mis
take in advising his client against the
writs and he was sorry for It. He said It

Lively Contest for Jewel at Bazaar
Being Held at Native Sons'
Hall.
The bazaar being held at Native Son*.'
Hall in aid of the Star of the. Sea Church
will close next Monday night. Those who
have not visited it will miss the oppoi
tunity of attending one of the handsomest
affairs of this kind ever held in this city.
The attendance last night was very large.
From early in the evening until late at
night large throngs of parishioners of the
church and friends of Father Coyle. ths
popular pastor, visited the bazaar and
spent their money liberally In aid of
charity.
The Oriental booth Is one of the mosc
attractive in the fair. It is presided over
by Miss Mamie Coyle and Miss Klsic
Moraghan. The booth is stocked with
fancy sofa pillows, hand-painted china
ware and beautiful lamps. The young
ladies were kept busy all last night taking
in the money. The "Star of the Sea"
booth is well looked after by Mrs. Shaugh
nessy Miss Barry, Miss Marie Kerwln
and Miss Richards. It is beautifully dec
orated for the occasion and contains many
handsome articles which are to be sold.
In the contest for the scholarship it
looks from present indications as if James
Riley will be the lucky boy to win the
handsome prize. In the Jockey contest
for the most popular knight of the pls-
Ekin Bullman Is in the lead, running easy,
but last night Jockey Logue was at the
fair and made such a deep impression on
the ladles that It is more than probable
that by to-morrow night he will be a very
close ' second. ' The most popular Jockey
will be presented with a very handsome
solitaire diamond ring, that has been
kindly given by Hammersmith & Field.
Every day until the fair closes, next
Monday, there will be. a business men's
lunch served in the basement of Native
Sons' Hall from 11:30 till 2 o'clock by tha
young ladies of the Star of the Sea parish,
the price of which will be only 25 cents.
THERE has been a stay in the
proceedings against Alexander
McKenzie before the United
States Circuit Court of Appeals
as a matter of courtesy to the
.Supreme Court of the United States,
which has now under consideration an ap
peal Involving the jurisdiction of the in
termediate court in the Nome litigation.
The interest in the case has not flagged,
however, for on motion of Mr. Pillsbury
an order was issued allowing the taking
of testimony in the Dubols case before
Commissioner Heacock.
The Xlubois case is one on an order to
show cause why the defendant should not
be punished for contempt of court. It
was charged that Dubois, who, it is
claimed . was acting as attorney for Mc-
related the events of the litigation and
the struggles between the claim holders
and the officers of the law, arid how the
gold was secured by its rightful owners
after the officials had refused to assist in
the matter. He'was examined closely by
Thomas Geary, who is McKenzie's attor
ney, and the cross-examination was all
the more searching because Geary's name
had been mentioned as one of McKenzie s
attorneys in the litigation in the north.
William H. Stetson was the second wit
ness examined, and the proceedings have
gone only so far as his direct examination.
In his testimony Mr. Metpon said that Mc-
Kenzie several times stated that he would
follow the advice of his attorneys In the
matter of the writs. Pubois announced
that he had advised his client to disre
gard the writs, and Metson said he knew
an opinion by Geary had been ren
dered and that a copy of It had been given

Th* Supervisors' Street Committee de
cided yesterday to recommend the pas
s-age of a resolution providing that the
Board of Public Works be authorized to
transfer all old material removed from
public streets and unfit for further use to
the Park Commission or any other depart
ment of the city government as the Board
of Public Works may determine, in the
fare of the fact that this course is not In
accord with thÂ»> charter provisions. Com
znisioner Maguin* and Attorney Gartland
of the Board of Public Works stated that
a lot of old street paving was being
taken up from Sixth. Fourth and Spear
ftreets. and. as most of it was worthless,
it would be a useless expense to cart it to
the Corporation Yard, as the charter re
quired. Gartland submitted an ordinance
providing for the transfer of the old
cobbles and "other street material to a
central station on some unused street,
tuch a* Berry street, where it could be
6old to any one desiring to purchase.
Chairman Curtis opposed this plan as be
ing in violation of the charter. He, how
ever, favored the" giving of the old ma
terial to the Taik Commission or other
departments, though the charter spe
citicaMy provides that all old street ma
terial must be Taken to the Corporation
Yard anil there sold at public auction.
Maguire pleaded that the downtown Cor
poration Yard was too small and the one
on City Hall avenue too far away to com
rly with the strict provisions of the char
ter.
C. G. Hooker urged the Street Commit
tee to take Ktfpp for the immediate im
rrr-vement of Rush street.
George Fletcher. \Y. C. Billington and
H. \V. Jaudin spoke In favor of reducing
the width of sidewalks on Clement street
in the Richmond district, while D. Daug
ers and F. I. Newberry arguÂ«?d against
the proposition. Action on the matter
was postponed.
Supervisors' Committee Would Au
thorize Board of Public Works
to Turn It Over to Park
Commission.

The banner was made in 1SSS. It was
paid for by money raised by prominent
Oakland Republicans, among wnam were
Warden liaie, then Sheriff ot Alameda
County, and Senator Eli Denison. Since
Republican majorities first began to be
fe-i\en, Alameda had btyen the banner
county until that year, when Los Angeles
gave Harrison a larger majority than
Alameda did. The OaK;anders spent $-50
on a splendid silk banner and sent a com
mittee to the orange belt to present it.
Noble Hamilton was . then Superior
Judge in Alameda County and he went
with the committee and made the presen
tation speech. In the course of his speech
he said that he hoped they would soon be
compelled to return the banner to Oak
land and that they would do it with as
good grace as Oakland yielded it to them.
The Los Angeles Republicans banqueted
the committeernen and gave them the
freedom of the city.
Four years ago Alameda County won
the banner back and a committee of
prominent Ix>s Angeles Republicans
brought the silken trophy up, and with
much ceremony It was given into the
keeping of the Oakland Alliance. Doubt
less the alliance will hold it until the of
ficial count makes certain San Francis
co's title to It, and until it Is decided what
organization on this side of the bay shall
become Its custodian.
The Union I>eajnie Club, the Bear Club
and the Phoenix Club have been men
tioned as possible guardians of the ban
ner. Whichever organization be chosen,
It 1* certain that there will be such a
merrymaking over the bringing of the
trophy to San Francisco as will dwarf all
past celebrations over its wanderings.
The Republican County Central Com
mittee of Oakland decided last night that
it would not hold any ratification meet

the banner to San Francisco County,
when it would have a little Jollification.

FOR CUSTODY OF
SILKEN BANNER
ACTION ON POOL
CASES TURNED
INTO A FARCE
District Attorney Threatens
â¢ to Repudiate an
Agreement.
Feels Annoyed at Not Being Consult
ed, and if He Presses His Ob
jection the Appeal Cases
Will Be Withdrawn.
Th" position of the cases against tfc*
poolsellers for violating th* ordinance
against pooUellmi^ has developed Into
what the attorney for the defendants
characterizes zs a farce, with the District
Attorney as the chief comedian.
When the seven cases were again called
yesterday in Judge Mogan's court Mr.
Collins, counsel for defendants, explained
that a stipulation had teen made between
himself and Mr. Coffey, special prosecu
tor, that all technicalities would be waived,
and a jury trial would also be waived. Â»o
that the points in dispute could be tested
in the Superior Court as speedily a-s pos
sible. If adverse to his clients they would
plead guilty in the Police Courts and g>>
out ot tne business. With tnat under
standing he said three cases, each havir.gr
a distinct point, were tried and were now
on appeal. If, as he was led to under
stand, the District Attornt-y was to insist
on tiie cases before his Honor being set
for speedy trial, tnereby repudiating tba
agreement, he would insist upon hu
clients being placed in statu quo by the
withdrawal ot the cases now on appeal
and their being tried over again by a jury.
District Attorney Byington said he did
not know of any stipulation till the pre
vious day, and ne did not consider him
self bound by it, as he had not been con
sulted in the matter by ColTey. He would
insist upon a speedy trial of tne cases now
on the calendar.
Attorney Coffey. who had refused the
previous day to take any further charge
of the cases, was asked by the Judge if
he nad noticed the .District Attorney, and
he replied that he had done so some tiuad
ago.
"You are mistaken." retorted Byington.
and Coffey was quick to reply, "You arÂ«
mistaken, Mr. Byington."
"Mr. Coffey," said Collins, "was asso
ciate counsel In the cases and any stipu
lation made by him is binding 1 upon the
IMstrJct Attorney, who cannot repudiate
his acts. Besides, the restrict Attorney
had his representative In court when the
agreement was mentioned at the time tha
cases row on appeal were heard."
"Leg-ally," said Byington. "I am not re
sponsible for the agreement of Mr. Coffey.
As a matter of courtesy to the other side-'
I might take it Into consideration."
The Judge suggested that the District
Attorney and Collins should wait upon
Judges Lawlor, Cook and Dunne and en
deavor to get them to set an early data
for hearing and deciding the appeal cases,
which would end the matter, and they
agreed to do so. The cases were mean
time continued until this morning.
Later Byington saw Judge Lawlor and
he agreed to see the other two Judges per
sonally and urge them to join with him In
giving the appeal cas^s a speedy hearir.gr.
A brace of Chinese burglars, with th?
skill and cleverness of up-to-date house
breakers, have for the past week Iwen
operating: with considerable Â«Â»uceess in the
Chinese quarter. Several nights ago they
entered the Globe Hotel on Jackson street,
and with the aid of a "jimmy" ..orced an
entrance into several rooms. In one of
the rooms, which was occupied by a Chi
nese gambler, they got away with a gold
watch - *w in money and a pair of trous
ers. The following night they forced an
entrance into a house on Pacific street,
near Stockton, and stole some Inexpensive
jewelry and a valuable opium pipe. While
leaving the place they were discovered by
one of the occupants, who attempted to
stop them. One of the burglars whipped
out a long Colt revolver and struck the
man on the head, inflicting an ugi>
scalp wound. His screams attracted \.i\p
attention of a special policeman, but be
fore the policeman reached the scene the
Mongolian crooks had disappeared, leav
ing their "jimmy" behind.
Detective Ed Gibson, who has boen de
tailed to run down the burglars. Is satis
fied that they are accomplished houst
breakers. Yesterday he found in a pawn
shop on Clay street the watch that had
been stolen from the Globe Hotel.

H 718 Market Street. t]To the student of general history the
epoch-making aspects of the Seven Years'
War (1756-63) are to be sought outside of
Europe. In India and in America, in the
triumph of England and the ruin of
France, as a colonizing and maritime
power. In this wider field the war marks
one of the great st&ges of modern history.
In Europe it was a struggle for existence
for Prussia and ended in the preservation
of existence with added weight but not
with added territory.
Hostilities began on the sea and in
America, but their extension to the Con
tinent was only a question of time, and
when that took place the aggressive
action of Frederick in striking the first
blow facilitated the completion of a com
bination against him which was a revolu
tion in traditional diplomacy. For two
centuries France and the House of Aus
tria had looked upon each other as natu
ral enemies, but the rise of Prussia had
introduced a new and unlooked for factor
In diplomacy and the penetrating Kau
nitz convinced Maria Theresa, that It was
Prussia and not France which was the
natural enemy of Austria. To win the
help of France In crushing Frederick was
a slow process, but the earlier events of
the war crowned the effort with success.
The Empress of Russia, who saw in the
expansion of Prussia eastward an ad
vancing bulwark to block the approach of
Russia westward, was ready for the com
bination with the design of conquering
East Prussia for Poland and receiving for
it Polish territory bordering on Russia,
By 1757 the alignment of forces was com
pleted and Frederick supported by Eng
land found himself confronted by. an alli
ance of Austria, France, Russia. Sweden
and Saxony to undo the work of a cen
tury of Prussian growth. Not only his
own conquest of Silesia, but all the acqui
sitions of his predecessors since the peace
of Westphalia were to be stripped from
him and divided among the spoilers.
Austria was to have Silesia and Glatz,
Pomerania was allotted to Sweden, and
Magdeburg. Halle and Halberstadt to
Saxony, the provinces on the Rhine to the
ish waters, and upon thÂ« restoration of
Moldavia, Wallachia and other Russian
conquests to respect the religious rights
of their inhabitants. This and some
similar articles proved the entering
wedge, to be followed by a claim of a
right of protection over the Christians In
Turkey. Thus Catherine, a sympathetic
spirit with Peter the Great, carried on his
policy in the South.
A few years later another step in tha
advance of Russia Is made when Cath
erine intervenes in the last contest be
tween Frederick and Austria. The ex
tinction of the direct line of the elector
of Bavaria, offered the versatile and am
bitious Emperor Joseph an opportunity to
imitate Frederick's policy in regard to
Silesia. The tables, however, were turn
ed and Frederick appears in the solemn
role of a defender of the peace of the em
pire and of the minor states, and In par
ticular the supporter of the claim of a
collateral line. Forces were massed on
both sides, but before blows were struck
Catherine Intervened. plavinÂ«r the part in
German politics of Richelieu In the pre
ceding century. Nothing could more
completely establish Russia aa one of the
great powers of Europe than Imposing her
arbitration between Prussia and Austria.
Joseph had to content himself -with an
nexing only a smaJl section of Bavaria,
the "quarter of the inn." comprislnsr
about 200 square miles and SO.OOO people
(1773> and the residuary claim of Prus
sia to Anspach and Baireuth was recog
nized. ,
Catherine's attention now turns srmth
ward again, and In 17W she annexed the
Crimea, Next. In conjunction with the
Emperor Joseph, she attempted the ex
pulsion of the Turk from Europe (17S9-92).
Her ultimate design was the restoration
of a Greek Christian empire, with her sec
ond grandson on the throne: her actual
achievement the conquest of tha terri
tory lying between the r>niester and the
Bug. Joseph had Joined In this enterpris3
on condition that he should have Servia,
Bosnia, Herzegovina. Moldavia and Wal
lachia and Dalmatla. One cannot help
feeling that the success of this grand
project would have been a blessing to tho
people of Turkey and have saved Europo
much wrangling and bloodshed for the

died of wounds received In the action be

The torpedo equipment consists of two

bestowed a gold medal upon Lawrence
and a silver one upon each commissioned
officer under his command. This success
also secured for him the rank of captain,

morning of June 1. 1813, the British ship
Shannon appeared off Boston, challeng
ing the Chesapeake to combat. The two
ships were, po far as sire and battery
were concerned, very equally matched,
but Lawrence was badly handicapped by
having a disorganized crew and was also
short of officers. However, he was willing
to accept the odds rather than appear
cowardly.
The Chesapeake weighed- anchor and
stood out to sea " to .meet -the Shannon,
whose crew was thoroughly disciplined
and had been continually exercised with

Pcllsh nobles and middle classes began
the introduction of political reforms
which should strengthen the powers of
the King and rid the country of the old
anarchy. But the self-regeneration of Po
land was the last thing that Catherine
wanted and under her Instigation a party
of obstruction was formed which invited
her intervention. The King of Prussia
saw the long-wtshed-for opportunity to
secure Danzig and Thorn, and while the
hands of Austria were tied by war with
France Joined Catherine in the second
partition of Poland (1792-93). At tha
sword's point the Polish diet had to ratify
this dismemberment of their country just
as the dawn of a better day appeared.
Russia took a north and south slice about
250 miles wide, with a population of about
3.000,000, mainly Russians and Lithuan
ians. The share of Prussia comprised
Danzig and Thorn and a tiianarular sec
tion extending northeast from Silesia as a
base and lying south of the annexation of
1772. It comprised about 20,000 square
miles and a population of a million and a
half, mainly Poles.
Two more years and the end came. The
Polish rising under Kosclusko was crush
ed and the remainder of the kingdom was
divided among Russia. Austria and Prus
sia. Again Russia extends her bounda
ries westward, this time about 130 miles,
and getting a large stretch of the Baltic
coast. The boundaries of Prussia proper
(old East Prussia) were pushed east and
south about seventy miles, taking In War
saw, while Austria secured West Galicla.
. In this extinction of Poland Russia was
the final gainer, for into her hands in
less than a generation came the share*
of Austria and Prussia in the third parti
tion and all but a small part of Prussia's
in the second partition.

elector Palatine, while trance was to con
tent herself for vast expenditures for the
cause of Austria with two harbors in The
Netherlands.
But as the efforts to parcel out the pos
sessions of Spain and Austria had failed,
so this project to dismember Prussia
came to naught.
The treaties at its close left the territor
ial boundaries undisturbed and Frederick
emerged from this life and death struggle
one of the greatest figures In history. For
the next hundred years Prussia is the
equal rival of Austria for the leadership
of the German people.
A moment's glance may bo given to the
last territorial acquisition made by France
under the old monarchy, interesting for
the double reason that it made Napoleon
Bonaparte a French citizen and because
of the analogry to our annexation or the
Philippines. The republic of Genoa, en
gaged in a hopeless effort to reduce the
Corsicans, who were struggling for inde
pendence under their heroic leader, Paoli.
invited the aid of France. For a time the
French held the coast towns while Paoll
controlled the interior. Finally, despair
ing of suppressing the insurrection, the
Genoese, preferring to see Corsica ab
sorbed by another power than indepen
dent, urged France to take over the island
(1768). Although Choiseul, the French
Minister, had advised Genoa to grant the
island independence, he would not refuse
an offer so advantageous to France. At
first unwilling to pay for the privilege of
putting down an Insurrection, he finally
agreed, out of pity for the Genoese, to
make them an annual grant for ten years
amounting In all to the equivalent of per
haps cne million dollars. The Corstcans.
resenting "to be sold like sheep," made a
heroic but hopeless struggle for indepen
dence against the power of France.
Before the entrance of Russia into Euro
pean politics the balance of power had
been adjusted by using the minor states
of Italy and Germany as make-weights,
but the steady encroachment of Russia
toward the west and south Imperatively
raised the question of the fate of Turkey
and Poland, in which Prussia and Aus
tria were vitally concerned Unity of
race (the Slavic) would facilitate Russian
absorption of Poland, and unity of both
raoe end religion would make the Czar
the champion and incorporation with Rus
sia the goal of the oppressed population
of European Turkey. Consequently,
henceforth the balance of power in East
ern Europe will be adjusted at the ex
pense of Poland and Turkey. This new
phase of European state growth was
brought into a glaring light by the delib
erate Rnd cold-blooded partition of over
one-third of Poland among Russia. Aus
tria and Prussia in 1772. The immediate
occasion was the Russian conquest of
Moldavia and Wallachia in the war with
Turkey, which excited the apprehensions
of Austria and seemed likely to precipi
tate war between Austria and Russia. To
avoid this issue, which would inevitably
involve Prussia. Frederick urged the Em
press Catherine to take a section of Po
land Instead: he in turn, in compensation
for his subsidies to Russia, would take the
portion lying north of Silesia and between
Pomerania and Prussia (so-called West
Prussia), and they both would secure the
acqulercence of Maria Theresa by approv
ing the appropriation by her of a third
section. Maria Theresa consented with
compunctions of conscience and after vain
(suggestions of alternatives.
Frederick obtained West Prussia, which
filled up the gap between Pomerania and
East Prussia, and made that outlying
possession more defensible. The popu
lation was German and Polish, and num
bered Fomewhat less than 1,000,000.
Strategically his share, although the
smallest, was the most valuable. The
Phare of Austria comprised Red Russia,
Lodomeria. part of Podolla. etc., with a
population not far from 2,000,000, mainly
Polish. From an economic point of view
It was the most valuable of the three sec
tions. Russia put up with the region east
of the Dwina and the Dnieper, populated
by Russians to the number of 1,500,000. Po
land was stripped of about one-third of Its
resist. The Western powers looked on un
easily, but without effective protest. A
mere flagrant violation of public right had
never been seen in. modern times. A
precedent for the conquests of revolu
tionary France and of Napoleon had been
established. Frederick's view was com
pletely divested of moral considerations
and he mercilessly ridiculed Maria
Theresa's compunctions of conscience and
with characteristic cynicism commented
on this union in plunder: "She wept and
she took. The Empress Catherine and I
were highway robbers, but the pious Em
press Queen, how did she arrange the
matter with her confessor?" "It will
unite." he wrote Prince Henry, "the three
religionsâ Greek, Catholic and Calvlnistlc
(1. e., Russia, Austria, Prussia)â for we

GRAPE-NTJTS.
There Are Thousands of Them Who
Believe as This Woman Does.
Mrs. Ira Knowlton of Butte. Montana,
is a most enthusiastic convert to the vir-
tues of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets as a
cure for obstinate stomach trouble. She
says: "I had poor digestion nearly all
my life. It now seems to me that for
years I never knew what it waa to be
hungry, to have a gocd natural appetite.
"I was troubled with gas In stomach,
causing pressure on the heart with palpi-
tation and short breath. Nearly every-
thing I ate soured on my stomach: some-
times I had cramps In the stomach which
almost resembled spasms.
"Doctors told me I had catarrh of tho
stomach, but their medicines would not
reach It and I would still be a sufferer
had I not. in sheer desperation, decided
to try Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablet*.
"I knew they were an advertised remedy
antl I didn't believe anything I read
about them as I had no confidence in ad-
vertised remedies, but my 9i3tÂ»r living lrÂ»
Pittsburg wrote me last spring telling
me how Stuart's Tablets had cured her
and her little daughters of Indigestion
and loss of flesh and appetite, and I hes-
itated no longer.
"I bought a fifty cent box at my drug
store and took two of the large tablets
after each meal and found them delight-
ful to take, being as pleasant to the taste
as caramel candy. Whenever during the
day or night I felt any pain or uneasiness
in the stomach or about the heart I took
one of the small tablets and in three
weeks It seemed to me as If I had never
known what stomach trouble was.
"I keep Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets in
the house and every member of our fam-
ily uses them occasionally after a hearty
meal or when any of us -have a pain or
ache in the digestive organs."
Mr. E. H. Davis of Hampton. Va..
says: "I doctored five years for dyspep-
sia, but In two months I got more benefit
from Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets than in
five years of the doctors' treatment."
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablet* is the safest
as well as the simplest and most conven-
ient remedy for any form of indigestion,
catarrh of stomach, biliousness, sour
stomach, bloating after meals, sympa-
thetic, heart trouble.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is not a
cheap cathartic, but an active digestive
remedy containing the pepsin and diastaso
which every weak stomach lacks, and
they cure stomach troubles because they
digest the food eaten and give the weak,
abused, overworked stomach a chance to
rest and recuperate. -
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are sold in
every drug store in the United States,
Canada and Great Britain.

The upward movement of prices here was
accelerated by better accounts from New Eng
land and Southern spinning sections and aleo
from cotton goods markets. The rally was
checked by telling for profits. The general
characteristic of the local market, however,
was decidedly better. The frost predictions
failed to unnerve shorts, while at the same
time creating manjr new friends for the mar
ket in speculative * circles. The close was
steady with net advance reduced 1S$21 points.
NEW YORK, Nov. 8.â The market opened at
an advance of Â«@io points and. further ad
vanced S1J22 points, chiefly on covering, al

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Nov. 8.
The city of Oakland will soon have an
election of its own, when several amend
ments to the present city charter will be
submitted to the people for ratification.
The City Council has set the date for this
election on December 8, exactly one month
from to-day. The call has been made and
the amendments have been framed.
The amendments are neither many nor
long, but they are considered essential to
regulate the present unsatisfactory con
dition of the municipal government. The
principal Idea is to take the offices cf
Mayor, City Attorney and City Engineer
out of patronage politics and put all ot
the patronage of the city in the hands. of
boards. For two years the city of Oak
land has suffered because of disagree
ments over patronage, and the business of
the city has been at a standstill because
of factional differences over appoint
ments. -The amendments to be submitted
on December 8 have been framed with
the idea of removing legislative and ad
ministrative officers from patronage as
much as possible and preventing the re
currence of the troubles that have beset
the city for nearly two years.
As the municipal laws stand now, the
Mavor, the City Attorney and the City
Engineer constitute the Board of Public
Works and the Board of Police and Fire
Commissioners and make all of the ap
pointments for the city. The proposed
amendments create a Board of Public
Works of three persons to be appointed
by the Mayor, to hold for six years, one
term to expire every two years, giving
eai-h Mayor the appointment of one mem
ber and preventing any one Mayor trom
se.-uring controlof the board. The sal
ary is to be $100 a month. There is to be
a separate Board of Police and Fire Com
missioners, arranged upon exactly the
same lines, with salaries of $40 a month.
The office of City Engineer is made
elective and the salary fixed at MOOO a
ve'ar, all fees to go to the city. The City
Engineer's offlce now costs the city nonrly
double that sum.
There are some minor, amendmentsâ one
to allow the city to own a dredger to keep
its water front in" condition, another, to
allow the city to build a garbage crema
tory and one to allow the city to expend
J300 a year for celebrating Memorial day
and $1(00 a year for celebrating the Fourth
of July.

CHARTER CHANGES
BERKELEY. Nov. 8.-Orral Overall, the
giant fullback of the university football
team, has been reinstated in the amateur
ranks, and will be pemiUed to play In
the annual Thanksgiving day game. The
official decision as to the amateur stand
ing of Overall was rendered by the Pacifie
Amateur Athletic Association to-night,
and an official registration card was is
sued to Overall, announcing that he waa
enrolled as an amateur and that his ama
teur standing was unquestioned.
Overall Is a freshman at the University
of California and proved to be one of the
most formidable members of this year's
team. - Stanford University tiled charges
of professionalism against him with the
faculty of the University of California,
charging that Overall played in a baseball
team in Visalia. hi9 home, on which team
one man drew a salary, and that he waa
thus disqualified for membership In the
University of California football team.
The faculty of the State University hekl
an investigation, sustained the charees
and disqualified Overall. It Is now an
nounced that this action was taken as a
matter of courtesy between the two uni
versities, as the one fact charged seemed
to be true, though it was a very technical
charge.
But the football enthusiasts of the State
University were not satisfied with this
decision and appealed the matter to the
Pacific Amateur Athletic Association,
which is the official and final judge of all
charges affecting the standing of an ath
lete in the amateur ranks. 'xul3 associa
tion appointed a special investigating com
mittee to inquire into thl3 case, with the
result that to-day a decision was rendered
In favor of Overall, who wtll now resume
practice at Berkeley and will undoubt
edly play in the Thanksgiving day game.

OVERALL RATED
AS AN AMATEUR
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway. Nov. 8.
As the result of a collision this morn-
Ing between a buggy, occupied by Robert
Fleming, superintendent of the telephone
company, and a wheel bearing Mrs. J.
Delon ot 831 Harrison street, the lady was
dangerously hurt. The injured woman
now lies at the Receiving Hospital, un
conscious from a concussion of the brain
and with chances about even for life or
death. . > Â¦'.?'%
At the time of the 'accident Mrs. Delon
had finished shopping among the stores
and had started down Clay street to do
another errand, several parcels being in
her hands. When about in the middle of
the block between Ninth and Tenth
streets she met the buggy, in which was
seateci Superintendent Fleming. She
kept on the course sho had selected wnerx
she entered the street and would havi
passed the buggy on the left if everything
had gone right.
But as the two vehicles came close to
gether Fleming's horse, for some un
known reason, swerved suddenly in
toward the left curb, crowding the bi
cycle rider and making a colllson un
avoidable. Mrs. Delon turned quickly to
one side in an attempt to avoid the con
tact, but was not quick enough. She
struck the horse on the left fore shoulder,
knocking it oft its feet, and then fell in
the street within a few inches of the ani
mal's hoofs. In struggling to regain Its
feet the. horse kicked the Â¦ prostrate
woman oh the back of the head, tearing
open the scalp and rendering her uncon
scious.
Fleming and some spectators of the ac
cident went to the unfortunate woman's
assistance and had her removed* to the
Receiving Hospital.
Mrs. Delon is a widow and supported
her aged mother by dressmaking. The
mother is a French woman, cannot speak
a word; of English, and only with diffi
culty could be made, to understand the
nature of her daughter's injuries.

leather reflected the little white clouds
which sail in the heavens.
Yesterday afternoon a group got to
gether in the rotunda of lÂ»ie Call build

thing doing. As the crock struck 2 Billy
Glennon sneaked " unostentatlonsly into
the building and a hurried conference was
held. After a little while Norris walked
out to the sidewalk, carrying a chair.
Glennon followed, wearing a shield after
the manner of a warrior bold, inscribed
with the motto. "I Lost." A friend fol
lowed with a box of blacking and a brush.
Shoes never took so long to shine as did

SUPERVISOR HAS TROUBLES.
Supervisor. James P. Booth Is lying
awake nights trying to think out a plan
of campaign by which he can roll a pea
nut to the top of the Press Club building:
stairs without spending the rest of the
century at it. He could easily get that
harmless peanut upstairs If he were al
lowed to choof e the method, but the terms
of the bet,- of which he was or the lobster
side, dictate that he must roll the peanut
upstairs with a toothpick.
The Supervisor has gone into light train-
Ing for the feat. He la also searching the
stands for an educated peanut that can,
hop from one step to the next when it 13
prodded with a toothpick. He is experi
menting with, invisible threads, steel wire
and other paraphernalia of the black art.
If worst comes to worst, he will attempt
to ring in a pot of mucilage.
F. N. Moore, the Press Club member
to whom Booth lost the bet. watches the
Supervisor's anguish with delight and;
complacently strokes his luxuriant beard,
saved by McKinley's victory from sacri
fice.
BILLY GLENNON PUTS A MIRRORLIKE SHINE ON THE EXPANSIVE SHOES OF JACK NORRIS BEFORE A

Although Judge Hart to-day admitted
in evidence during: the rates, suit trial j
the report of Engineer L. J. Le Conte j
made in lsSfi to the City Council upon the
valuation of the Contra. Costa Water j
Company's plant, there is h wide differ- I
cnof' in opinion between the contesting j
attorney as to the value of the report.
The fact is, as developed from Le '
rente's candid admissions on the witness
etanfl, that a large amount of the Infor- '
mation it which his estimates of value
fare bas^a was simply given to him by ;
Anthony Chabot as a matter of recollec- i
tion. But most important <>f all. the evi- |
dence Is now upon the formal records of I
the case that there were no records kept i
by the water company of the early work !
of construction upon the great San LÂ«an- ,
<;ro dam from 1*kjÂ» to 1S7G. Engineer Le
< v.nte declared that ther^ was very little
Information extant upon any of The un- â¢
'ierground work which was done, and that I
'.:'Â¦ had r^Hed upon Chabot." s statements to
cover that lapse.
Not only that, but there was little or
nothing of record, according to Le Conte,
concerning the constructing work in 1SS6.
The maps then in existence showed only j
the works as projected by the company i
up to that year, but did not Indicate what j
was actually done. In other words, none
of the modifications, changes and altera- .
tkms in the original plans were available. '
In his explanation of the 1Â«M> report, '
Engineer Le Conte, as the water com
j.any'p witness, admitted that he had been i
employed by the City Coum-ii of that year j
to prepare an estimate of valuation. " lie -
said, in response to questions:
"Mr. Chabot. thf-n president of the Con- \
:ra Costa Water Company, showed me I
over the works and gave m<.- a broad, gen
eral outline of the system. He placed at
my disposal such records as he had. but :
I then discovered the lack of facts In ;
them; and he paid he had given me all the '
data he had.
"I grot the best Information there was
at hand. That Is the best I can say."
Then Attorney McCuuhen wnmed Le
Conte to refresh his memory from the re
port in giving his testimony. Mr. Hayne
objected until he had a chance to cross
examine Le Conte.
"The trouble is that the Council called
for an accurate and correct report." ex
plained Le Conte, "and the information
was lacking, as I have explained. It is
true that there were few or no records of
the early construction.
"I had to roly for my data largely on
Mr. Chabot and the constructing enginrrr.
I got Â«1I facts and details of the under
ground work from Mr. Chabot. there be
ing no record of it."
Mr. McCutchen a*, last offered the re
port itsolf in evidence.
There was long argument. Mr. Hayne
objected on the ground that on the face of
the evidence the report was largely made
up from hearsay; that L<? Conte had re
lir-d for everything about thv works ex
cent v.hat he could actually pee upon
hearsay^ and that It oould not be material
or relevant testimony. ...
But Judge Hart overruled the objection
and made the report part of the record.
His Honor held that because some of the
Councilman had said they had considered
Â»his report that it should be Introduced.
During some preliminary argument Mc-
Cutchen made the statement that so far
as a City Council was concerned It was
to be treated in a legal sense the same as
an Individual. . \" â¢ _ :-
Ueplying. Hayne started off: "Counsel
has said that the City Council is no better
than an individual."
"Sometim^R Worse," Interrupted the sar
castic Mr. Moore. â¢' â¢ . '..* Â¦ - : --^
â¢Well, if the balance shall ever be
struck in this case we will nnd that the
<"')uncil hasn't burned any books or done
anything of that kind." quietly retorted
Ha'vne. The thrust struck home.

report is its effort to force proof that the
valuation of J2.728.9i6 on the plant, exclu

it* hands full in trying to bridge the
chasm from ISC'? to 1SS6. The admitted
raucitv of records of construction forced
thÂ« company to fight for the Le Conte re
port to be admitted as evidence.

The Bay City Athletic Club gave Its
monthly fistic exhibition last night at
Palo Alto Hall, 320 O'Farrell street, before
a large gathering.
The first pair of boxers, F. Neil and
Charley Anderson, started in to furnish
an interesting set-to, but when the round
was about half over Anderson found a
soft spot In the ring, where he could lie
comfortably until ten seconds had been
counted out to him. Neil landed a hard
one in the start-off, and from that time
Anderson devoted most of his energy* to
ward trying to crawl through the ropes.
Charley McCarthy and Pete Coleman
made it' interesting for the spectators
through five good rounds. Both were will
ing and anxious to score a knockout, and
at the, end of the fourth round, honors
being even, another round was ordered.
The youngsters went at it with a will,
and when the gong sounded at the finish
there was nothing to choose. The referee's
decision, a draw, satisfied the crowd.
The best bout of the evening was that
between Gus Salisbury and Charles Haw
ley. From start to tlnish it was a fight
that was never lacking In any of the
qualities that please ring patrons. Two
extra rounds were fought before a winner
could be named. Hawley had a slight
lead at the start and held It throughout,
though Salisbury was ever ready to land
a hard one or take a few, in a. mix-up
The boys set a rapid pace in the first
round and never eased a bit until Hawley
was declared the victor at the end of the
sixth. The general verdict was that the
bout was a more satisfactory one than
the average big tight seen in San Fran
cisco.
The bout between Abe Attell and Frank
Dell furnished amusement. The scrap
pers weighed in at 107 pounds. Dell, a
chunky, cross-eyed young Itaidan, when
the. gong sounded: crouched bo low and
swung about so wildly that he seetned to
be giving an imitation of a first attempt
at swimming. Â¦ .
Garrlty and Sullivan, featherweights
went through four slow rounds. Sullivan
got the decision.
For two rounds his work consisted of
long distance swings. Attell caught him
a couple of stiff ones in the third round
and after a mixup In his corner he took
the advice of his seconds and went to
sleep.
Harry Bowers won from Sailor Sharkey
in four rounds. Bowers swung often and
landed seldom. The bout, was not scien
tific, though quite amusing.
Fred Bell and Dan Berry kept the crowd
yelling during the two extra rounds or
dered by the judges.
The final event, the go between Jack
Sullivan and James Ryan, was an or
dinary affair and required an extra round
for a decision. Sullivan won.

velopment was begun almost immediately.
"Klondike" Berry and a number of his
Frtsno friends were interested in the
proposition. AboutjJO.OOO or SO.OoO shares
of the' yOt.i.OOO which were issued werj
paid up and are under the control of Lay
mance. Less than 100.000 shares came
into the hands of Dingee. and later
Bowles and Waiklnson. But by consent
of the stockholders, the first board of di
rectors which was organized was con
trolled by the minority holders, Dingee,
Bowles and Watkinson. The other mem
bers of the board were Dr. Merrell and
Laymance.
Meanwhile the oil properties were de
veloping in excellent shape. Oil was
struck in commercial quantities. The fu
ture seemed rosy and everything pointed
toward the success of the proposition as
a big financial* investment, and. barring
the struggle now on, the investors are
still satisfied that there will be big things
In the deal. The best evidence of the
belief of the stockholders is the bitter
ness which has been manifested in the

Business , Relationship of W. J. Dingee and W. C. Beatie
Is Broken as a Result.
split of the Interests Involved
The first intimation that was given to
the Berry forces of the impending effort
to win control of the company, came to
light about six weeks ago. The board of
directors, including Dingee. Bowles and
Watkinson, held a meeting ajid decided to
levy an assessment of 5 cents a share on
the Giant Oil Company's stock. The
Berry-Beatie-Vinzent side, with its 300 -
000 shares, rose in rebellion. The nominal
purpose of tho assessment was to pay up
some outstanding accounts and to use the
balance In further work on the properties.
The Berry side at first decided that they
wculd fight the levying of that assess
ment and make a test. The majority
stockholders appeared to be in the
hands of a minority board of directors.
But they bided their time. The day for
the annual meeting of the Giant Oil Com
pany came along. With the 300,000 shares
<f stock, plus the paid up holdings of Lay
mance combined, they ousted the Dingee
board of directors, electing In their place
Clarence Berry, Dr. Merrell, W. C. Beatie
Ed G. Vinzent and M. J. Laymance.
These directors promptly adopted a res
olution postponing the day of sale of the
delinquent stock. The question arose
whether one faction did not hope that tho
assessment would not be paid. But those
brhlnd the guns on the Berry side are not
yet ready to declare publicly what was
the opposition's purpose. The day and
hour of sale as fixed by the old board of
directors was 2 n. m. Wednesday, Novem
ber 7. and they sold the stock that was
delinquent, according to their contention
to Banker P. E. Bowles..
The deposed directors Dingee. Bowles
nnd Watktnson made the claim that the
meeting at which they were ousted was
not regular; that the action In postponing
the time of the sale was unwarranted.
:ind that the new board had not any legal
standing in its capacity as directors. The
majority stockholders paid the assess
ment to Laymance. who was elected sec
retary by them at this reorganization
meeting, as a matter of protecting their
interests, but the opposition refused to
recognize Laymance's right to accept the
assessment. Both sides ; have secured
counsel. Emll Nusbaumer has been re
tained by the Bowles interests, while On
the other side are R. M. Fitzgerald. John
H. Durst of San Francisco and Frank
Short of Fresno, who represents the Berry
investments.
Edward McGary Jr. will succeed Mr.
Beatic in the Contra Costa Water Com
pany. When asked to-night about his re
tirement. Mr. Beatie said: "Upon the ad
vice of my attorneys, I have nothing to
say for publication."
Attorney Emll Nusbaumer, representing
Bowles, declined to discuss, the matter
upon the ground that it was as yet a pri
vate transaction.
OAKLAND. Nov. 3.â The sever
ing of a twenty years' confiden
tial business relationship be
tween William J. Dingee. vice
president and controlling owner
r.f the Contra Costa Water Company, arid
Walter C. Beatle. secretary of that cor
poration. Is one of the important feature.*
of a battle that has opened for thr con

has severed Beatie's connections with
Dinpce. Behind this separation Is tho
st ->ry of the fierce struggle which has in

world.
The fight Involves as the chief prin

on the other. Ranged upon the Dingee
side are J. H. T. Watkinson. president of
the Contra Costa Water Company, and
P. E. Bowles, president of the First Na
tional Bank. Dr. J. M. Merrell. a prom
inent mining man. Is also heavily inter
ested, while behind Berry are half a dozen
prominent investors of Fresno. Beatic.
Vinzent and M. J. Laymance of this city,
the original promotof of the companies*,
with Dr. Mtrrell. have lined up behind
the Berry imprests and the fight is on to
a finish. The situation came to a hoa<i
yesterday when the Dingee board of di
rectors sold out, 300.000 shares of Giant Oil
stock held by the Borry faction,
<>n the claim that it was delinquent upon
an assessment of 5 cents a share. The
Berry side hold receipts from Laymance,
the secretary of the company, for the as
sessment paid up. and now the courts, it
is expected, will shortly be called upon
to sottle the question of title to the stocK.

: The annual bazaar of the Ladies' Relief
Society, which was held to-day at the res
idence of Mrs J. N. Knowles, on Jackson
street, was distinctively a society event.
From 2 o'clock in the afternoon until 10
o'clock this evening the great rooms of
the Knowles home were thronged with
ultra-society people of Oakland. All aft
ernoon and evening there was the* rustle
of many movements and the hum of busy
conversation. The hum increased in vol
ume at night, when the crowd was aug
mented by the presence of many gentle
men, :. .
As for the sale, from it was realized for
the ladles' relief work a very considerable
sum. The sale of articles useful and or
namental was far beyond the most san
guine expectations of the management.
Before the evening came tQ an end there
was not a commodity left of the many
original ones that could be sold, bo fast
did the things go.
Nothing could have been more simple
than the decorations, but their very sim
plicity made them attractive. They con
sisted of great sprays of huckleberry
branches set In vases and bunches of
white and yellow chrysanthemums at in
tervals upon the sale tables. In each of
the large rooms several sale tables were
placed, these being bountifully laden with
articles of all kinds.
- The first of these tables was the tea
table, over which Mrs. William Taylor,
assisted by Mrs. Harry J. Knowles, Mrs.
Fred Magee and Miss Carrie Havens, pre
sided. Upon !t was an elegant silver serv
ice, which was busily employed at all
times In the serving of most delicious tea.
At the lemonade table Mrs. Lloyd
Rawlings, Mrs. George C. Edwards and
Miss Jane Rawlings presided and gave re
treshment to the many who visited there.
The candy table was in charge of MIsb
Louise de Frcmery, Miss Florence Selby,
Miss Sue de - Fremery, Miss Miranda
Brainard and Miss Jean Howard. The
candy was home-made â by the ladles of
the Relief Society. It was secreted in
pretty baskets, and berlbboned boxes that
were each a purchase in Itself.
All sorts of useful things were to be had
nt the household table, which was under
the care of Miss A. E. Minor, Mrs. A.
Llllencrantz. Mrs. W. D. Gellette, Mrs.
J. B. Treadwell and Miss Mabel Gellette.
There were 'Tatchalls." laundry bags,
dusters, brushes, mats and many other
things in dally use in the household.'
The miscellaneous *ahlo. was burdened
with a Kro.Tt number of infar.ts' articles,
klmonau. nfflans and little dresses. Tho
Â»ad!es who ,old thorn were Mrs. John T
Wriffht. Mrs Wlllium Me*>k Mrs. W p!
Mmizy, Miss Cf>mrt>el! and Mrs. Thomis
Phoby Jr.
There wore some elegant tMnes at the
pillow and '.amp shade table, and many
were the exclamations of wonder at their
beauty and design. Oriental por~h r>il
lovrs, hammock niilows. big pillows rind
little pillows, cushion covers and Oriental
squares made up tho department. The
lamp shade department was equally good
tn thÂ» variety of iis show, many 'of the
shades being very handsome. Mrs. c O
G. Miller and Miss Mary Durham wera in
charge of this table.
Mrs. Louis Tashlera, Mrs. Spencer
Brown. Mrs. Allen Babcock and Miss
Radford disposed of commodities from
the apron table. There were aprons of
every descriptionâ aprons for nurses and
aprons for children, all of them, prettily
worked. v
The fancy articles table was presided
over' by Misa Campbell. Miss Marv de
Fremery and Miss Crissle Taft. It" was
their duty to sell at the very highest price
procurable center pieces of all kinds and
sizesâ dollies, mats, fans and fancy bags.
The doll table was one of the prettiest
and most interesting of the bazaar. There
were dolls that talked and some that
didn t talk; they were of all sizes and pro
portions. Besides the dolls, there were
doll dresses, bonnets and afghans. The
fancy stockings for the use of Santa Claus
were pretty. Miss Alice Knowles and
Miss Ruth Knowles were in charge of the
dolls and their things. The young ladles
who assisted them were: Miss Bessie
Palmer, Miss Chrissle Taft. -Miss Ruth
Dunham, Miss Leslie Greerf. Miss Ella
Sterrett. Miss Bertha McElrath, Miss
Phfbe McElrath, Miss Pauline Fore and
Miss Ethel Valentine.
,The Modoc and Klamath Indian baskets
attracted great attention. There were not
half enough to go aroujid and not long
after the sale commenced they had been
all sold. Mrs. J. N. Knowles, Mrs. C. L.
Bliss and Mrs. Henry H. Adams were at
this table.
It was only durfng the evening hours
that the guests were entertained with a
programme of music and song. This was
entirely Impromptu, the ladles present
who were called upon. lending their talent
for the pleasure or the guests
To Mrs. J. N. Knowles. Mrs. E. C Wil
liams, Mrs. Dam. Mrs. Matthews, Mrs. J
E. McElrath and Mrs. Harry L. Gordon
are due the praise for the success of the
bazaar. They worked earnestly In its be
half and made it complete in every par
ticular, the result being that all who at
tended were pleased beyond measure.
The purpose of the bazaar was to raise
funds to give Christmas cheer to the in
mates of the homes af\ Temescal sup

for aged women, one for children and one

COLLISIONS AT SEA
American Delegates to International
WASHINGTON, Nov. 8.-The American
delegates to the International Marine Con
ference, Rear Admiral Franklin, Captain
John W. Shackelford and W. W. Good
rich, Clement A. .Griscom and S. I. Kim
ball, met at the Bureau of Navigation to
day to consider the proposition to modify
in several particulars the rules for pre
venting collisions at sea, in so far as they
relate to lights on fishing vessels. The
changes relate particularly to travelers to
the North Sea.
In so far as they refer to American fish-
Ing vessels the changes proposed are in
accord with the views of those most di
rectly Interested.
After some discussion the delegates de
termined to ask Congress to adopt the
proposition which originated with Great
Britain. The enforcement of these rules,
if adopted by Congress, will be conditional
upon their adoption by the other principal
maritime powers, as the. Intention is to se
cure greater uniformity in the rules to
prevent collisions at sea.
The American rule for lights on steam
pilot vessels is also to be made the inter
national rule.

beat him to death. The Moorish Govern
ment disclaimed responsibility for mob
violence of this kind, but the United
States Government contended that the
Moorish Government had failed In its ob
ligations In declining to take any steps to
punish the perpetrators of the crime.
Mr. Gunners la directed again to present
the case, with an urgent request for a set
tlement. It so happens that the big bat
tleship Kentucky is making her way
through the Mediterranean to Manila and
if she touches- at a Moorish port, as she
would be very likely to do, her presence
mav have a beneficial effect in stimulating
action upon the Consul's demands.
BIO MINING DEAL IS
REPORTED IN DENVER
Portland Mine May Be Consolidated
"With Stratton's Independence
by Big Syndicate.
DENVER, Nov. 8.â Although the re
ported sale of the Portland mine is de
nied at the offices of the company In
Colorado Springs, It is generally believed
In mining circles that this big Cripple
Creek property will pass Into the hands of
an English syndicate, consisting of the
Venture corporation, the Exploration
Company and Werner, Belt & Co., the
South African diamond miners, and in
vestors In Mexico mines and railways.
It is said that the price to be paid Is
about J15.000.000. It Is known that experts
for the concerns in the deal have made a
thorough examination of the property,
and from London the report comes that
the deal Is practically closed.
The plan reported from London Is to
consolidate the Portland with Stratton'a
Independence and to form a new com
pany to control both of the great gold
properties. Such a consolidation would
create not only the greatest gold mining
property in Colorado, but probably the
greatest In the world.

ACCORDED HIGH HONORS
Receives His Commission as Procu-

of Holy Cross.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 8.-Very Rev.
Peter J. Franciscus, for several years
Superior of the Holy Cross College, affil
iated with the Catholic University of
America, has received his commission as
Procurator General of the Order of the
Holy Cross, with headquarters at Notre
Dame, Indiana. Rev. Father Burns of In
diana has been appointed -to succeed him
at Washington.
The Sisters of Notre Dame opened Trin
ity College for the higher education of
women by the Catholic University yester

month. â¢
To Prevent Yellow Fever.
HAVANA, Nov. 8. â Hereafter the
steamboat companies will meet transat
lantic liners outside of Havana harbor
and will transfer immigrants destined for
other points. It Is thought that this-pre
caution will result In a rapid decrease of
the yellow fever, as 90 per cent of the
cases now under treatment are among the
Immigrants.
BALTIMORE, Nov". 8.â Rumors were
current to-day concerning a combination
of trans-Atlantic steamship companies
which will involve several companies and
millions of dollars. It was said that the
Atlantic Transport Company, which ope
rated lines of steamships between New
York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Lon
don, will be a part of the combination.
Bernard N. Baker, president of the com
pany, when seen to-day said: "I have
nothing to give out." â¢ .
Others -.Interested In the combination
were equally reticent, but It was learned
from an apparently reliable source that
negotiations are going on In New York,
and that a representative of the Atlantic
Transport Company is in that city look-
Ing after its Interests.
Color Is given to the rumor by the
strength of Atlantic Transport Company
stock on the exchange to-day. Since Au
gust 30 the stock has risen 45 points.
Details of the deal are guarded carefully
and it is understood the stockholders of
the Atlantic Transport Company will re
ceive more than $200 per share for their
holdings in. the event of the consumma
tion of the deal.
The Atlantic Transport Company has In
service now seventeen vessels ranging In
tonnage from 4250 to 13,240. The Minneton
ka and the Mlnnewaska. now building at
Belfast, will be launched next spring and
placed In tha New York-London trade.
They will be of 13,240 tons burden and
similar in design to those now building
for the company by the Maryland Steel
Company. Besides these vessels, the
company Is building two at the yards of
the -New York Shipbuilding Company at
Camden, N. J., and will shortly award
contracts for two more. The latter ves
sels will probably be built at Norwich,
Conn.
The shlp9 now In service are the Min
neapolis, Mlnnehaha, Mesaba, Manitou,
Menominee, Marquette, Mohawk. Michi
gan, America, Europe and Manhattan, on
the New York-London route; Montana,
Minnesota, Mackinaw and Maryland, on
the Baltimore and Philadelphia-London
route. The company also owns the Maina,
which is in the service of the British Gov
ernment as a hospital ship.

Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
CALL BUREAU, WELLINGTON
HOTEL. WASHINGTON, Nov. 8.âGos
eip is in circulation In army circles re
garding the prospect x of the return of
three officers of high rank in the Philip
pines. These officers are Major General
Arthur MacArthur, Governor General;
Major General J. C. Bates and Brigadier
General F. D. Grant. All of these officers
have been in the Philippines since the
breaking out of the rebellion and it is said
that an Intimation has been received from
at least one of them that transfer' should
be made.
Officials of the department insist that
there is little likelihood of the return of
the officers named, but upon reliable in
formation it Is asserted that correspond;
ence has been In progress on the subject
and that the President has gone so far as
to decide that' a chief of staff corps can
be ordered to command troops In the
field, provided he has military educa
tion.
It seems to be the general impression,
even In official circles, that Generul Grant
will return home with the volunteer
troops and perhaps Major General Bates
may accompany them. As to General
MacArthur. he is needed for the direction
of the campaigrn to be inagurated in ac
cordance with orders sent some days ago,
though the department Is not entirely
satlstled with the conduct of the military
operations to date. There is only one
officer at the bead of a staff corps who
would ba available for service In the
Philippines under the President's alleged
ruling and that is Paymaster General A.
E. Bates. General Bates says, however,
that he does not expect to go to Manila.
In making changes In his ranking officers
in the Philippines, the President Is handi
capped by reason of the small number of
officers of similar rank available to suc
ceed them. Major General James Wilson
of the volunteer service, who was with
General Chaffee, has been ordered to re
turn to the United States, Indicating that
he will not be continued in the service
when the army is reorganized, and Gen-
General Chaffee, as soon as the situation
In China Is satisfactorily settled, will be
sent to Manila. He is looked upon as the
logical successor of Genera] MacArthur
when that officer is brought home and
General Bates Is relieved, as he will then
be the ranking major general on duty In
the archipelago.
It is not thought that the President will
make any further appointments as briga
dier general in the regular army until
Congress convenes. It was stated to-day
that a prominent member of the Military
Committee of the Senate had intimated
that it would be desirable to refrain from
appointing and retiring officers as briga
dier generals until the committee had an
opportunity to determine the propriety of
such action. It is the intention of the
President to promote and retire Colonel
A. S. Dapsretf. Fourteenth Infantry, and
Colonel Theodore Schwan, assistant ad
jutant general. It Is known that the
President made the distinct promise that
he would appoint General "Wood brigadier
general in the regular service and his ap
pointment is expected after the retire
ment of Colonel Schwan.
Possible Changes in Philippines.
Colonel Daggett to Retire and
Gen. Wood to Be Appoint
ed to Regular Army.

Grant May Accom

Â¦ â¢ Monk left the house Saturday evening
with another roomer and they went down
town. At Geary and Kearny streets Monk
left his companion, saying he had a
"date," and that was the last seen of him.
As he did not return McGinnls became
alarmed and broke open Monk's trunk.
The money was gone. McGlnnis com
menced a quiet investigation on his own
account, and when he ascertained that
Monk had not returned to work at the
tannery and had not drawn his week's
.wages he thought it was time to report
the matter to the police. Yesterday he
swore to a complaint in Judge "Conlan's
court charging Monk with felony embez
zlement, and the warrant was given Into
the hands of Detectives Graham and Fitz
gerald. It is supposed that Monk is in
hiding, waiting the departure of the next
steamer for Australia, Â¦ whence he or
iginally came.
While McGlnnis was searching through
Â¦Monk's trunk he discovered : from corre
.spondence that. Monk had deserted his
wife and three children, two girls and a
boy, in Australia about four years ago.
Further, it was discovered that about six
months ago he married a divorced woman
known as the wife of "Doc" Wilson in
Santa Cruz, and also deserted her. She
is now in Santa Cruz and is in a condition
that requires care and attention.
Monk has been known as "Doc" Wilson
and Roy Smith. He Is a man between 35
and 40 years of age, 5 feet 7 or 8 inches
tall, dark hair cropped short, dark heavy
mustache, gray eyes, prominent nose and
slightly bald. He wore a dark suit. J
Monk, who worked for a tanner on the
San Bruno road, had a room in McGinnls'
house. MeGlnnls sold some land ln Val
lejo for $800. He got the money on Octo
ber 25, and that night he remarked in the
presence of Monk that he did not know
what to do with the money, as he did not
wish to place It in bank Just then. Monk
suggested that he put It in his trunk,
where it would be absolutely safe. To
this McGinnls agreed.
Â¦ John Monk, a tanner. Is wanted by the
police on a charge of felony embezzle
ment, and there is every reason for the
belief that he is also a bigamist. The
complaining witness against him on the
embezzlement charge Is Thomas McGln

POLICE LOOKING
FOR EMBEZZLER
AND BIGAMIST
Robert Dollar said yesterday that he
had discussed, the matter'of building the
new steamer for his use with the Fulton
Iron Works people. It had been his idea
and also Mr. Wood's that two vessels
could be built more economically than
one. He said to the Fulton Iron Works
people that he would not go ahead until
after election. "Mr. Wood felt the same
way that I did about the matter. He be
lieved that Bryan's election would dis
turb business for a long time and It would
be better to wait," said Mr. Dollar.
The Bteamer for MrJ Dollar and the. one
that Mr. Wood will probably now con
struct will each have a capacity for car
rying 600,000 feet of lumber. The cost of
building will be quite large. Benefit will
also result by the furnishing of addition
al facilities for carrying on the lumber
business tributary to this port. There
was a story current yesterday that Mr.
Dollar had already signed the contract
on the day following election, but Mr
Dollar said that this was not true
Because President McKlnley was re
elected, Robert Dollar will proceed at
once to have a new steamer built for lum
ber carrying between this port and Graj'3
1.: arbor. Had the national election result
ed ln the choice of Bryan, Mr. Dollar
would not have placed an order at this
time. E. K. Wood and Mr. Dollar have
been talking recently about having two
steamers built on the same plan, for the
same sort of work. Mr. Wood had the
same idea thnt Mr. Dollar had, that the
election of Bryan would disturb the busi
ness of the country seriously. Mr. Wood
therefore waited, with Mr. Dollar, to see
how theÂ«election would come out. Now It
is probable that the two vessels that the
gentlemen have had under consideration
will scon be urider way.

should be removed to the City Hall. The
committee reported against covering the
photograph gallery ln the Hall of Jus
tice building with a temporary roof, and
decided instead to devote the funds to
finishing the Morgue building.
McCarthy's motion that the company be
directed to produce at the meeting next
week the original contract for building
the old pumping plant at Lake Merced
was adopted.
Reed s motion that the company furnish
at the next meeting the name of the per
son from whom the Lake Merced plant
was purchased, also the purchase price
and a list of the land and water rights ac
quired and the capacity of the lake, was
carried. -
Attorney Kellogg then took the stand
and testified that the valuation on which
last year s rates were fixed was much less
than the actual valuation of the property
though he admitted that no record of val
uations was kept by the company.
At this point Braunhart presented the
following resolution, which was adopted:
Resolved. That the president and secretary
of the Spring Valley Water Company be re
quested to certify to the board on or before
December 1 the cost to the company of the
several Items of the property contained in an
inventory of its property filed October 5. 1900.
with the Board of Public Works
To a question of Reed, Ames said no
estimate had ever been made of the real
value of the Lake Merced plant used in
supplying water to San Francisco nor had
any valuation ever been placed on the
whole system by the company.
"I cannot tell exactly at what the com
pany values its plant or assets," said
Ames, "and the rate we aBk for Is based
on the actual requirements to pay taxes
maintenance and interest or dividends on
bonds and stocks."
Ames said that no money derived from
the water schedule had ever gone Into
betterments and all the construction of
the Merced system, to his best recollec
tion, had been paid for from the sale of
stock or bonds. All maintenance was paid
out of the money received from water
rates.
A desultory talk followed on the techni
cal difference between "betterment" and
maintenance when any improvements
were constructed. Ames said he could not
give any information as to depreciation in
the plant, as no mercantile books were
kept. The company, he said, did not
write off anything for deterioration
though Brandenstein held this to be a
legitimate procedure.
" D P. you mean to say that you do not
provide for depreciation ln your prop
erty?" asked McCarthy. v v
"Why, we keep no such account," re
plied Ames.
Ames said the first purchase of the Lake
Merced property was made by the. Spring
\ alley Water Company, in 1876 from a con
cern known as the -Lake Merced Water
Company for $150,000. The purchase com
prised water rights only and no land was
acquired at the time. Ames said he had
no details of the other purchases or the
names of the persons to whom the money
was paid. Reed said that unless the
names and amounts were forthcoming the
statements made by Ames could not be
verliied. Ames then produced a memor
andum showing that the cost of the Lake
n r S?o d /. P ro P er ty was as follows: Land,
?G(9,098 60; water rights, $150,000; pumping
grounds, $389,692 43; improvements in dams
?. nd , dredging canals, $346,65127: total, $1,
oob,44J 3o. No interest or repairs ln the
way or maintenance were included in that
sum, which represented tne first cost of
the Lake Merced plant.
To a question of Reed, Ames said that
ms knowledge was derived from the
books of the corporation and covered a
period from 1SS8, during which he had been
secretary. In 1S03 the improvement of the
South Lake was made at a cost of $200,
000, which resulted in a perfect drainage
canal from the lake to the ocean, thus in
suring unpolluted water. Reed's persist
ent inquiry for details caused Ames to say
that instead of frivolous details he had
thought it preferable to give figures on
the various items he had enumerated.
Ames said he could not inform the board
as to the value of the various items in the
inventory furnished by the Spring Valley
Company to the Board of Public Works
as he did not have the leisure to get the
information. McCarthy eaid that unless
tne cost were given the board would be
unable to ascertain the value of the prop
erty. This was necessary. McCarthy said,
in order to dear fairly with the company
and with the consumers.
Ames said that an abandoned pumping
plant at Lake Merced cost 5166,000. and
Reed contended that this item should be
stricken from tlio value of the plant as it
was not contributing to the working of
the system. Ames would not answer
Reed's question as to whether there was
any other item Included in his estimate
which was not now actually used in iho
distribution of the water from the lake
Ames said that much of the machinery
formerly in the pumping plant had blen
transferred to other localities In the svs
tem Attorney Kellogg held that such
machinery had been charged to the new
ocaJitles. Ames did not know how much
property 3 lnClUded ln the L^e Merced
Braunhart desired to know If the com
pany could furt-lsh the cost of the iron
Pipe or of any item enumerated in the
Inventory Ames said the cost of plpl
had varied and when it was bought nart
pf it might be sent to one place and part
to another.
to Supervisor Connor, chairman of the
water committee. Pelham Ames, secre
tary of the corporation, was on the stand
all evening, and he was subjected to a
rapid fire of cross questioning regarding
his knowledge of what the various sys
tems controlled by the- Spring Valley
Water Company cost originally. But lit
tle Information, however, was gleaned
Â£ om -â¢ mes > as he was only able to give
tne values as taken from the company's
books. .
After several unsuccessful attempts the
Board of Supervisors finally met last
night as a committee of the whole for the
purpose of beginning an investigation into
the values of the property of 'the Spring
Valley AVater Company's plant with a
view to^ fixing the water rates for next
year. Fourteen Supervisors were present

INVESTIGATION
OF WATER RATES
FINALLY BEGINS
Joseph Campbell will answer Mr. Lane
this morning. Garret McEnerney will then
present hfs views on behalf of the de
fense and John Garber will close the argu
ment. â¢
How can effect be given the charter as the
organic law of the city and county of San
Franel*eo If It does not supersede all laws re
lcting to the government of counties and all
laws inconsistent with Its provisions?
Â¦"Where 1b the power to pay such deputies ex
cept by conforming with the provisions of the
chart erT
Why should a court be called upon to pre
judge the rights of parties not before the
courtâ the deputies of the so-called county offl
ccrs7
In concluding Mr. Lane said he would
suggest that opposing counsel answer four
questions which he would propound.
These questions are:
What authority haa Plaintiff CrowleV to en-
Join th* Civil Sen-ice Commission from holding
examinations? How can the hands of that civic
body be tied permanently by a taxpajer. suing
as such to prevent expenditure of public funds
for such examinations?
Garret McEnerney, who is associated
with the defense, said he also questioned
the regularity of the proceedings, the
present action being one in equity, in
which a property right must be Involved.
'Even though the commission expended
a million dollars in holding these exam
inations," he said, "Crowley's taxes
would be Increased but $2 40. He must be
a poor financier or he would have willingiv
paid the J2 40 instead of employing such
eminent counsel to save himself the bur
den of this tax."
Here Judge Hebbard interrupted and
called for more law. Mr. Lane proceeded.
After a few citations Mr. Lane called
attention to what he referred to as the
"danger" of holding that the county gov
ernment act Is operative as to San'Fran
clsco. Such a decree, he said, would de
stroy the acts of the Board of Super
visors and "enforce the formation ot a
board of- five Supervisors, as that act pro
vides, to exercise Jurisdiction over countv
matters, would invalidate the acts o'f
courts and cloud titles, in addition to the
thousand and one evils that would arise
from such a construction of the law."
"But," said Attorney Joseph Campbell
of counsel for the plaintiff, "the county
officers do not wish to lose their positions
by forcing the commission to mandamus
them. Recorder Godchaux was forced to
sp<K?dlly comply with the Mayor's sug
gestion that he accept the list under pen
alty of dismissal."
Mr. Lane next attacked the action of
hearing, claiming that It was prematurs.
He suggested that the proper remedy
would have been Instead of seeking to
enjoin the Civil Service Commission from
holding 'examinations to have permitted
Â»uch examinations and then. In event anv
of the so-called county officers refused to
accept the list handed him by the com
mission, to have determined the points
involved by mandamus proceedings
against the officer refusing to accept such
list.
After a few further authorities ln sup
port of Plaintiff Crowley's contentions
had been cited by Attorney Frohman, rep
resenting Rarber. Creswell & Garber, City
Attorney Lane opened on behalf of the
defense. The county government act, he
contended, never did apply to the city
and county of San Francisco. By and
through the consent of the people of Cali
fornia, represented in the 'State Legisla
ture, the right to exercise the functions of
a county in it? relation to the State had
been delegated to the consolidated city
and county government, he said. The peo
ple of the State by the consent of the
Legislature had signified thefr -willingness
to trust the body politic existing within
thfÂ» territorial limits of San Francsco to
fulfill Its duties to the State as though a
couny government under the county gov
ernment act were In operation. This con
dition, he said, now exists under the char
ter of the city and county of San Fran
cisco as it largely did under the old con
solidation act. The power had been given
to the people of California, he further
contended, to delegate the authorltv to
exercise county governmental functions to
the governmental bodies of the consoli
date city and county of San Francisco
by Sections 8 and 8M> of the constitution.
The provisions of these sections of the
constitution had been adhered to ln the
merging of the city and the county gov
ernments, and hence, he claimed, "in the
literal and legal sense there no longer ex
lf<t<Â»d r distinct county government.
Under this theory there remained no
deputies, he continued, of so-called county
officers whose rights are jeopardized.
Neither, he said, could the appointment of
such deputies at the beginning of these
officers' terms be considered permanent.
The temporary appointment of deputies
to prevent the stoppage of public busi
ness could not be considered permanent,
Mr. Lane further asserted, and such ap
pointments were made to hold only until
such time as the civil service provisions
of the charter became operative.
Francisco are a single body politic and
that henre there is no county govern
ment within the territorial limits of San
Francisco and consequently can be no so
called county officers, it is making stren
uous efforts to force the present action
out of court on the ground that it is pre
mature and without warrant of law.
San FranclBCo's status within Its own
territorial limits and Its peculiar position
as a subdivision of the State of California
âwhether or not the merger of the city
and county of San Francisco as a body
politic has been completed or whether the
city and the county of San Francisco are
separate and distinct entitiesâ has been
accepted by the legal defenders of the
civil service provisions of the charter as
the salient Issue involved ln the action
now on hearing before Judge Hebbard of
the Superior Court. Though the defense
to T. J. Crowley's attack? on civil service
contends that the city and county of San
Declares That Deputies Were Ap
