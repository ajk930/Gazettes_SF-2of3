"There is no popular question which ap
peals so strongly to the American peo

phase of It that appealr. to the patriotism
of the American people."
" Adverting to the amount of the subsidy
which would be drawn by the vessels of
the American International Navigation
Company Hanna said he did not propose
to evade any of the slanders or calum
nies of anybody in, connection with this
matter. He declared that; the '.four ships
of the American line which are carriers
of mail had _ not made a net dollar since
they came under the American flag. Me
challenged the assertion of Clay that each
of the fast vessels of the American- lino
would draw $304,090 annually from the
proposed subsidy. .'
Clay directed -the Ohio Senator's atten-

reviewed the history of the American
merchant marine from the establishment
of the nation to the present time and
maintained that the decadence In Ameri
can shipping had begun in 1860 and not in
1S55, as the Senator from Missouri had as
serted. _ . Â¦ Â¦
Hanna declared In the circumstances
there was not to-day a question so Im
portant to the maritime nations of the
Old World as the prevention of American
competition on the high seas. The foreign
commerce of tha United States is four
times larger "to-day than ! it was in 1860
and yet the proportion of the foreign car
rying trade Is now less than one-third
what it was in I860. This, said he, is a
most, humiliating decline of the great na
tional Industry. He added:
Vest of Missouri . interrusted thÂ© Ohio
Senator to challenge this statement that
the Civil War caused the decline of ship
ping. He declaVed the decline had begun
as far back as 1855.
Discussing the rise and fall of the
American merchant 'marine Hanna de
clared that .the beginning of the decline
in the industry, was coincident with the
outbreak of the.Civil War.
Hanna maintained that . in order to
build up the American merchant marine
it was necessary not only to have the cap
ital !and experience but it was necessary
likewise "to afford our foreign-carrying
trade protectionâ some kind of Induce
ment â by law."-. If .this protection should
be afforded, said Hanna, the growth of
the American merchant marine would be
on a. par with the growth of the shipping
industry on the Great Lakes.

The supplementary war loan and appro
priation bills were passed to a second
reading.
FOB FOMENTING REBELLION.
Timothy M. Healy. Irish Nationalist
member for North Louth asked how
much of the new loan was to be floated
in Wall street. He added: "I strongly
object to the association of Wall street ia
British national interests. When we have
the unscrupulousness of Wall street on
tcp of us, we shall pay dearly for the
small sum saved the country in discount.
The whole cost of the war should be
placed on the Transvaal."
Sir Michael Hicks-Beach said that pos
sibly the new colonies could not bear any
part of the cost of the war fcr a year or
two after the wax ended, but he had In
mind the future development cf the Trans
vaal's vast wealth, and hail made tha
falling due of the various loans at such
periods as would enable the Government
to see what burden might be imposed on
the Transvaal. In any event no unreason
able demand would be made. Without
expressing a final opinion, he thought
that direct taxation of the profits of tha
mines was a question deserving the most
careful consideration.
Sir William contende-I that. Judging
from the present prospects, the cost of
British rule in the Transvaal and the
Orange River Colony would be far greater
than Boer rule had been. He estimated
that General Baden- Powell's police would
cost Â£4,000,000 a year, a sum equal to the
last Transvaal budget.
During the second reading of the war
loan bill In the House of Commons to
day Sir William Vernon-Harcourt criti
cised in general the Government's finan
cial makeshifts. He said the Ministers
would have tremendous support in mak
ing the Transvaal share the cost of the
war. But, he poir.ted out, the gold mines
were the only source o" revenue, and the
attitude of the mine-owninÂ«r capitalists
was well Known. They would not pay for
the war except or. compulsion, and the
capitalists were masters of South Africa,
controlled its politics and would be su
preme In the colonies. If the Govc-nment
wished to obtain anything in the Trans
vaal toward the cost of the war it would
have to face the "Kaffir circus" In South
Africa and London, and It would require
all the courage of the Chancellor of the
exchequer and the Colonial Secretary
and all the Integrity of Parliament to
cope with the matter.

Says There Is No Truth in the Tale
That He Is Planning to

LINCOLN. Neb.. Dec. 13.â Both -W. J.
Bryan and D. E. Thompson make unqual
ified denials of the truth of a story printed
In New York wherein they are alleged to
have arranged a Republican fusion deal
whereby they could be elected to the
United States Senate from Nebraska.
Mr. Bryan said: "There is not a word
of truth In it. I have other plans."
Mr. Thompson, who is a Republican and
a candidate for the Senate, said: "Tha
story Is not true. I am making comblna
tlons with no one. certainly not with a
Democrat."* You cannot make my denial
too strong."
W. J. BS7AN DENIES THE
REPORTED FUSION DEAL
ate'a time with a speech advocating rad
ical alteration of thu treaty. He an
nounced hlmseif as favorable to the com
mittee amendment, but said that to his
mind the amendment did not go far
enough to meet Jhe wfslvy 1 of the Ameri
can people. Ke~beileved\ he said, that* it
the canal was to be constructed by the
Government.of the United States the peo
ple would demand complete and absolute
control over the canal itself, and al3o
the right to exercise their own judgment
as a nation, not only In acquiring property
in connection with the canal but. if ne?d
be, in securing sovereignty over it. He
contended that to pursue this course In
volved no violation of international
rights, and In defense of this position said
the United States had made an offensive
and defensive treaty with France in *179?
and soon afterward had repudiated' that
obligation. He also cited other prece
dents and authorities, some of them be
ing from English sources, in support of
this position. He argued, in short, that
changed conditions warrant a change in
conduct and In position.
The speech was listened to with much
interest and at its conclusion a motion
was made to have It made public. Ob
jection, however, was raised and the or
der was not made.
After the Senate adjourned for the day
the Republican Committee on Order of
Business held a session to decide upon the
future line of action with reference to the
treaty as amended. After this commit
tee had concluded Its conference Senator
Lodge, who was with the committee,
stated that the Senate would proceed
with the treaty, and he would continue
his efforts to have it ratified.
COMMENT ON SENATE'S ACTION.
Regarded by Many as Heavy Blow
to Canal Project.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.â The action of
the Senate to-day is regarded . by high
officials as the severest blow that could
be dealt the canal project and the ad
ministration policy. The Call has high
est official authority for the statement
that the British Embassador does not
believe his Government will accept the
amendment. Advocates of the fortifica
tion of the canal, however, are not satis
fled with, partial: success. Senators El
klns, Foraker, Money, Teller and Tlllman
have offered amendments to the treaty,
all aiming at American control and the
fortlttcations cf the water way. The Sena
tors confidently assert that further
changes will be made.
The administration is not likely here
after to press the treaty with such vigor
as has heretofore marked its course. Sec
retary Hay, however, will not let the ac
tion-of the Senate affect his decision as
to his continuance in the President's Cab
inet, vi::';
ThÂ© action of the Senate is deplored by
the London newspapers as a triumph of
the jingoes. Comment on what Great Brit
ain's course should be is reserved by
many of the Journals until, the situation
is viewed more fully.
WAR BEVE1HJE REDUCTION.
WASHINGTON, Dec- 13â The debate
upon the war revenue reduction bill was
continued in the House to-day. It was
dull and featureless. Those who spoke
were ' Grosvehor. of Ohio, Bartholdt of
Missouri, Hall of Connecticut, Boutelln
of Illinois, McClellan of New York, New
lands of Nevada,, Levy of New York and
Underwood of Alabama. .
Bartholdt criticised the s action of the
Ways and Means Committee on not mak
ing a deeper cut'in the tax on beer and
gave notice that he would offer an amend
ment to- reduce it to $1 50 per barrel. Gen
eral debate upon Â¦ the bill will close at 2
o'clock to-morrow and Payne, the floor
leader of the majority, expects the bill
to pass before : adjournment to-morrow.
The House to-day adopted;, a resolution
for a holiday recess from Friday, Decem
ber 21, to Thursday, January 3. 1901.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.â In ac
cordance with previous agree
ment the Senate in executive
session took a vote at 3 o'clock
to-day on the amendment to
the Hay-Pauncefote treaty authorizing
the United States to defend its Interests
in the canal. The Senate did not close its
doors until 2 o'clock, and there was then
left only one hour's time for discussion of
the provisions of the amendment. The
vote was taken by yeas and nays, 65 votes
being cast in favor of the amendment and
18 Against it. . The negative votes were as
follows: Bard, Beveridge, Frye, Foster,
Hansbrough, Lindsay, Mason, McCumber,
McEnery. McBride, Morgan, Money,
Stewart, Tillman, Wellington, Wolcott
and Gallinger.
After the amendment offered by the
committee was passed upon various other
amendments received the attention of the
Senate for a brief time, but none of them
were acted upon. The committee amend
ment which was adopted is a provision to
bo Inserted after section five of article
two of the treaty, and is as follows:
"It is agreed, however, that none of the
immediately foregoing conditions and stip
ulations, in sections numbered one. two,
three, four and five of this" article shall
apply to measures which - the United
States may find It necessary to take foi
securing by its own forces the defense, of
the United St3tes and the maintenance of
public order."
The committee amendment no sooner
had been adopted Â¦ than various Senators
took the floor to suggest further amend
ments. The amendment which probably
attracted most attention was offered by
Senator Elklns and is as follows:
- "Nothing in this treaty shall be con
strued to prevent the United States from
acquiring sufficient security and sover
eignty, or to prevent it from building, op
erating, maintaining, controlling and de
fending the said canal (referring to the
proposed Nicaraguan canal), or for any
other purpose that the United States may
deem for Its beat interest."
Other amendments were suggested by
Senators Tlllman, Allen, Money and
Thuraton. Senator Thurston's suggestion
provides that* the United States may* de
fend the canal, and Senator Tlllman'B
makes the committee amendment adopted
by to-day's vote apply to all the provl-
Bions of article two. This would have the
effect, it is believed, of nullifying the pro
visions of section seven of the article,
providing against the' fortification of the
canal. Other amendments were offered
striking out sections three and seven of
article two. Senator Teller said that if
8enator Elklns" amendment Bhould be
adopted he would not presa his amend
ment for the modification of section seven
so as to omit the provision against the
fortification of the canal,
Previous to taking the vote on tha
committee amendments Senator Klklns

Senator Lodge, in charge of tha bill,
was not slow to recognize - the futility

The substitute for the three resolutions

Upon a roll call the resolution, as
amended by the committee, was adopted
by a large majority.
"There has not been one important step

Mitchell, "that has not been bitterly op

Pennsylvania. To-day our people earn as

John Mitchell, president of the United

t!on. Two resolutions championed by the I
radical element were voted down by over- !

pronouncement against trusts and monop- j

tion ia favor of the co-operative common

Throughout the debate the proponents
of the resolutions claimed socialism as

should be d^ne away with and the co

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET. N.
W.. WASHINGTON. Dec. 13.â In order to
effect a settlement of the preliminary ne
gotiations in connection with the Chinese
question Secretary Hay has accepted the
suggestion made by Great Britain yes
terday making a more explicit declaration
included in the agreement that the Chi
nese must accept the terms presented be
fore final negotiations can begin.
Why Great Britain urged a modification
of the phrase "indispensable condition of
negotiation" is a mystery to the author
ities, but as the change does not con
template the renewal of hostilities in case
of a refusal of the Chinese envoys to ac
cept the terms imposed they determined
that in order to expedite the matter it
would be wise to instruct Minister Conger
to sign the agreement modified as the
London Government desired.
It . is believed by the authorities that
Russia, Japan and France will follow the
example of the United States and accept
the British suggestion. A dispatch re
garding the change was received yester
day ' from Embassador Choate, but It was
not clear and it was not until Secretary
Hay discussed the matter this morning
with Lord Pauncefote. the British Em
ba^aador.. that he fully, understood the
character of the modifications.
So far as Germany is concerned and her
desire to have a more explicit understand
ing regarding the meaning of the term
"as severe as China can impose" in con
nection with the punishment of the re
sponsible authors of the outrage, the of
ficials seem satisfied that she will be
forced to join with the other governments
in approving the agreement.
ANGLO-GERMAN AGREEMENT.

relating to the Anglo-German agreement
has been laid before Parliament. It re
veals the fact that the agreement is now
tripartite. Japan alone of the powers
invited to Join made special inquiries of
Germany and Great Britain respecting
the agreement. Japan then replied that
the "imperial Government having re
ceived assurances from the contracting
parties to the effect that in adhering to
the agreement in question they will be
placed in relation to such agreement, in
the same position they would have occu
pied if they had been a signatory instead
of an adhering state, does not hesitate
to formally declare she will adhere to
such agreement and will accept the prin
ciples embodied therein."
The assurances of . Germany and Great
Eritain alluded to are not given. The
replies of the other powers do not differ
from the previous announcement.

he was a brother of Guido -Matiare, a

steamship owner, before the Commerce
Commission, In the course of which he
stated that the American line vessels
â¢would receive that sum of subsidy.
"I am not using Clyde's flgures,' r replied
Hanna, "but my own."
Hanna dwelt at length upon the desir
ability of having a large merchant marine
to draw upon for auxiliary ships in case
of war. .
"Will ,all Fhips auxiliary to the naval
power of the ' United States," Inquired
vest, "such vessels as transports and sup
ply ships, participate in this proposed
subsidy?"
"I do not think bo," replied Hanna.
"Then," retorted. Vest, "the language of
the bill ought to be changed."
Referring to what be termed the news
paper attacks upon the pending measure.
Henna declared that men who undertook
the responsibility of, the bill before the
people were entitled to as much courtesy
and Â¦ consideration as' were the critics of
the proposed legislation.
"Where will you look for the accom
plishment of the desire to re-establish the
American merchant marine?" inquired
Hanna. "but to the .men who have givÂ«n
their lives to the consideration of the
question?" Â¦ Â¦'
After dwelling at length upon the ef
forts of the maritime nations of Europe
to prevent the investment- by Americans of
capital in the upbuilding, of an American
marine and urging that the proposed con-
Btruction of the Nicaragua canal, together
with the rehabilitation of this country's
marine power, was only a part of the
great problem of transportation, Hanna
said that no plainer proposition than that
contained in the pending bill ever was
presented. It would attract capital and
lay the foundation for a great industry.
The enactment of the measure into law,
he urged, would benefit materially Â¦ the
shipbuilding industry and create a de
mand for labor in every department of
business and commerce. Hanna in conclu
sion said:
"In my appeal to the American people
for the re-establishment of the great ship
building industry, I want to put it on
higher grounds than mere dollars and
cents.' It is away and beyond that point
In patriotism and pride In our national
life.- As to the popularity or unpopularity
of this measure, I stand here to say that
every line of it Is in the Interest of the
American people. Upon that basis; I
make my appeal for its passage and
leave the question in your hands."
The Senate then, at 2:05 p. m., on motion

"WASHINGTON. Dec. 13.â In the Senate
Committee on Military Affairs to-day the
hearing on the army reorganization bill
was continued, and In addition to a num
ber of array officers Archbishop Ireland
and Bishop McGoldrlck were heard. The
two prelates *=poke only on the provision
of the bill prohibiting the establishment
of canteens or post exchanges. Both of
them pronounced the provisions unwise
and expressed the opinion that the can
teen is In the interest of temperance and
good morals In the army.
Archbishop Ireland based his remarks
especially upon his observations of af
fairs at Fort Snelling. near his home at
St. Paul. He paid that he was sure, from
all that he had seen and heard among the
soldiers that the canteen is a powerful
factor in the protection of the soldiers
from outside temptations of all kJnds and
he did not accept the theory that the
canteen brings temptation to! the troops
that otherwise would not come to them.

MCRDER, suicide and accidental

ship Crown of Scotland as one
of the most sensational made
by a wind jammer in many a year.
. The Crown of Scotland left Penarth
(Cardiff) 1S8 days ago, and soon after
clearing the British Channel there was
some heavy v eather encountered. In tho
Bay of Biscay Salvatorcs Servis fell from
the fore yard Ui a fit and was killed. For
a time the ship had hard luck, but after
that all went well until latitude 14 : de
grees 19 minutes north, longitude 121 de
grees 30 minutes west, was reached. That
was on November 24 at 10:30 a. m.. and
then occurred a tragedy that has kept the
crew talking ever since. One sailor

It east quite a gloom over the ship for some
days, as Haglunrl was very popular. A Swede I
by" birth, age 28; a thorough sailor and of a I
very quiet disposition.
On beard the Crown of Scotland the
men were very adverse to discussing the
tragedy. "She's a hoodoo, anyhow," said
one burly Jack Tar. "and every night we
can see Jack with his knife crawling up j
and stabbing Pete in the breast. One I
thing's sure, I'll never sail in this craft
again. They can keep my pay. I'm going j
to desert f>s soon as the sails are clewed i
up."
"It's th# veriest kind of rubbish," said
(foptain Jenkins, "but still the men think
they see something. Sailormen are, 1
think, the most superstitious mortals on
earth, and some of them may honestly
believe they see something. Outside of <he
death in the Bay of Biscay and the trag
edy off the coast it was one of the finest
trips I have ever made to the coast."
The British Consul will hold an inves

Scotland, and will send a report thereon

made to wave the murderer, but he de
liberately drowned himself in full view
of 'the boat's crew that was going to his
itscue.
P. A. Haglund and John Warrington
were bosom friends in Liverpool, and
when men were wanted for the Crown of
Scotland both of them shipped and were
sent to her at Penarth. Once aboard,
they got themselves in the good graces
ot the nvue and both were put m the
starboard watch. During the. Iirst part of
the voyage the two men were like broth
ers., but off Cape Horn- they . began to
quarrel. OH Valparaiso they came to
blows, and when the coast of Central Am
erica was reached they were deadly ene
mies.
The starboard watch went off duty at
8 a. m. Saturday. November 24. and as
soon as they reached the forecastle War
rinKton and Haglund besran quarreling.
They separated, in a few minutes, and
Haglund went to his bunk and fell
asleep. Some time had passed when War
rlngton crept up to his sleeping friend
and plunged his sheathknife into his
breast. He then rushed on deck and
jumped -overboard, Ha^lupd jumped out
of his bur.k. plucked the knife from his
breast and fell fainting on the deck.
Everything possible was done for him by
Captain Jenkins, but he died a few hours
later. . . Â¦ ..

For Murder Fourteen. Years Ago.

pelf-defense, the other man b&vtog as-,
saulted him with a knife while they were
returning to his house from milking cow*
on the evening of July 2. 1*M>. At the trial ;
the prosecution combated the claim of
self-defense and endeavored to show that
Austin killed Brower to gain possession
of a sum of money that he was known to
carrv on his person. The defense claimed
that* Brower, although 50 years of age. j
was desperately in love with Austin's
fourteen-year-old daughter, now Mrs.
Eflie Briggs, and wanted to marry her,
but the parents refused to give their >
consent. Brower was very angry at them
on that account, and while riding in the ,
wa^on with his employer attacked him
with a knife. Austin, to defend himself,
knocked Brower out of the wagon and in
falling he struck the back of his head on
a stone and was killed. Through ignor
ance, Austin disposed of the body and told
no one but his wife, who helped him to
keep the secret all these years.

Organized Bands of Young
Men Commit Awful
Atrocities. /
PARIS. Dec. 13.âThe close of the. expo
sition, throwing thousands out of employ
ment, has created abnormal criminal con
ditions in Paris. The sensation caused
by the murder of the man whose body
was found in two parcels in the streets
here December 4 and which is still
wrapped in mystery, has directed atten
tion to the fact that the outlying quar
ters of Paris are infested by bands of
footpads and hoodlums wi.o terrorize the
residents. The papers are filled with ac
counts of their nightly exploits. Two
respectable workmen were attacked a fevr
nignts ago by four prowlers, who, after
picking a quarrel almost decapitated one
of the workmen and stabbed tne other in
the abdomen. None of the murderers naa
yet been traced.
A feature of these nocturnal attacks 13
that they are very often not accompanied
by robbery, but are perpetrated apparent
ly by bloodthirsty criminals, frequently
boys In their "teens. Four boys, the old
est of whom is 17 years of age, g.igged
and assaulted a young girl at Belleville re
cently, and then dragged her to the canal
side, "with the view of drowning her, when
passers-by rescued the girl.
The bands frequenting Belville and Me
rilmontant style themselves "Apaches.
They have committed a number of atro
cious and cowardly attacks.' Another and
similar band is called thÂ« "Amandlers.
The police up to the present seem power
less to cope with the situation.
A Â«ang of thievts recently held up a
street car !n a populous southern district
and robbed the passengers, while an im
portant electric car line serving the sub
urbs of St. Denis and St. Ouen has re
fuped to run its cars later than $:J) in the
evening on account of the danger.
It was announced to-day that thÂ» Pre
fect ct Police had decided to place a
couple of policemen on each street car
ruYihinp into the suburb** after S:Â»0 p. m. .
and that he had also decided to create a
t-pecial corps of picked men to be sta

the ward where the severed body was dis
covered. Moreover, in order to secure
murder clews, the police for several
nights have raided the disorderly dis
tricts and have made large hauls of crim
inals wanted on other charges. A ral'l
yesterday evening led to no fewer than
347 arrests. Â¦â¢ .
In fairness It must be said that the
present condition of crime is largely due
to the number of workmen, street nawK
crs and others who came to Paris at
tracted by the exposition, and who are
now out of work. It is estimated by the
statistician of the Central Labor Bureau
that in twenty-five trades 212,000 out of
510 .tXK) persons are idle.
The officials of the prefecture of police
calculate that 2000 sufferers from the close
of the exposition have Joined the criminal
army.

bler, was shot and instantly killed here
this mornlrg by Jim McKlnney, a fel
low with a like reputation. Sayers and
McKlnney were companions and room
mates. They' had been drinking and
gambling all night, and worked up a
grudge against each other wlilch resulted
in the killing in an alley between K and

the quickest. He sent his -bullet directly
through Sayers 1 heart. McKinney was
immeaiately arrested.

Los Angeles on his way to San Francisco
early in January, and when he arrives
here he will receive the "glad hand" in a
manner not bestowed on any official of
the system by the business interests of
this city for many a year.

ment of the new head of the Southern Pa

eral weeks, and it has been decided that

organizations of the city will take the ini

Over 800 larks were killed, besides a num
ber of hawks, crows and other destructive
birds. The team captained by H. Mar
tin made the most points and won a sup
per. The farmers are anxious to kill off
the larks and such birds that they can, as
It means hundreds of dollars in the clean
up at the end of the year. The birds do
much damage to the crops, and if allowed
to thrive without molestation would over
run the country and be a thorough pest.

TWO HUNDRED
ARE DROWNED
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER. B. C., Dec. 13.â The res
cue from captivity In an Esquimau vil
lage of a well educated Englishman who
has been kept prisoner for five years in
the extreme northern wilds of Canada is
an achievement just accomplished by a
Government exploration party. The de
tails are authenticated by Professor.J. W.
Tyrell, the famous explorer of Canada,
Â¦who has just rf turned from the barren
lands west of Hudsons Bay. station,
bringing the released captive with him.
Charles Bunn, the man who was he'd
by the Esquimaux, has been compelled
to Jive as one of them for over live years.
He was found In a village at the head
waters of the Thelon River at the ond of
the 2000-mile journey due north under
taken by Professor Tyrell and his party.
The nearest settlement of Europeans is
IjOO miles away and between lies the
wastes of the barren lands inhabited only
by a few bands of nomadic Indians and
hÂ« j rds of thousands of musk oxen.
lionn'p Etory is a strange one. He was
wÂ»ll-to-do in England and came out as
tho representative of a wealthy concern
to trade in rich furs and skins with the
northern Indians. Bunn went out on a
long hunting trip with only one Indian
guide, in the spring of 189Ti. They secured
at low prices a large quantity of very
valuable furs and in the fall were start
ing home to Edmonton when they were
frozen in.
They were taken care of by the Thelon
Esquimaux, but in a few weeks the In
dian died. The natives then refused to al
low Bunn to depart. They confiscated his
goods and took him to a new village 3<J0
miles further up the river, where escape
was impossible. That was early in IS.%,
and since then Bunn has lived as an
Esquimau. A woman was allotted to him
as a wife and for the most of the time
he was very happy. Bunn Is now return
ing to England.
Trying Experience of Edu
cated Englishman in the
North
WINDSOR. Dec. 13.â John Wori-
B'.ieck, one of Windsor's bright
and promising young men,
committed suicide last night.
Deceased was a native of Aus
tria, having come to this country with his
parents at the age of 7 years. He was
highly esteemed by all who knew him
and had held some responsible positions.
He was employed by the Lamar Bank of
Lamar, Colo., as clerk until last spring,
and has recently been connected with the
well-known firm of Miller & Hotchkiss.
The deed was evidently premeditated, as
Worishcck was never known to have used
liquor until yesterday, when he took sev
eral drinks, supposedly to brace himself
up.
"Worisheck left the Lamar Bank and
came back to Windsor last July, and since
that time it has been conceded by his
most Intimate friends that his mind has
at times been unbalanced. He seemed to
be very changeable and at times despond
ent it is thought, over a love affair. Be
fore retiring last night he took two doses
of medicine, administered by his mother,
and asked for more, but it was refused
him. When the family had retired he arose
and Cold his mother that his "head was in
a whirl and that the Catholics and Masons
were having a light." He was a Catholic
end had been attending church at every'
opportunity here of late.
From blood stains on articles of clothing
and a bloody razor found in his room it is
evident that he endeavored to take his
life with the razor, and went out to the
kitchen sink to bleed to death, as the sink
was covered with blood. Death by this
method was apparently too slow, and he
went into the tankhouse. which adjoins
the residence, and placing a revolver to
his head blew out his brains.
The family did not hear him leave the
house nor hear the report of the revolver,
but thought he had gone back to bed after
being at the sink to get a drink of water.
His mother, after going to his room this
morning and not finding him there, be
gan a search for him. and on entering the
tankhouse was horrified at the discovery
of the body lying upon the floor. A phy
sician was "summoned, but on examination
HELD CAPTIVE
BY ESQUIMAUX
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 13.â Happy, well
fed and ragged, joyously jingling small
changeâ lucre looted from overzealous
yellow newspaper agitatorsâ the children
of Porto Rico passed through the city this
afternoon. The tattered travelers turned
with benign smiles upon The Call repre
sentative, and not a word of evidence
that they were being mistreated could be
obtained. , Of the 114 passengers In the
three sleeping coaches twenty-one' were
women and nineteen were classed as chil
dren. If the present ratio of Increase con
tinues the children promise to outnumber
the adults by the time Hawaii Is reached,
for there have been no lees than three
births since the train left New Orleans.
The star attraction in the motley crowd
was a group of three men who stood near
the train. They were the yellow repre
sentatives, who had Joined the party at
Indio. For two days they had dilated on
the disadvantages of Hawaii as a settling
place for Porto Ricans who sought to im
prove their condition, and had distributed
small gratuities among such of the Im
migrants as could be induced to speak in
sympathy with their views. The men re
ceived their pittance, and after walking
around the train returned for more. Just
before /the train pulled out one energetic
fellow flaughingly held out his palm, in
which rested 45 cents thus collected. Then
he boarded the train with the rest and
merrily bade adieu to the Journalistic trio,
left alone and lorlorn.
"You can't blame the men for doing it,"
remarked Frank Alvis, who had charge
of the colony. "They need the money,"
he added, laughing.
Alvis Is a Porto Klcan who has lived for
several years past In Brooklyn, N. Y.
"These families and men." he continued,
"are bound for Hawaii, where they will
be employed by the Hawaii Sugar Plant
ers' Association. There they are to re
ceive ?20 per month for ten hours' work
a day, all overtime to be paid at doubie
rates. They will be furnished with
houses, water, light, wood and medical
treatment, all free. They are not under
written contract, the understanding being
verbal, and all are weil satisfied with
the arrangements. They receive their
transportation and board during that time
free. They are supplied with tnree meals
a day of good, wholesome food, and not
one word of discontent was heard until we
reached Indio. There we sidetracked for
two days, preferring to stay there rather
than/ in San Francisco, where the men
might become separated. This was In ac
eoruance with Ihfir expressed wishes aft
er having been consulted upon the matter.
"It was here that the yellow corre
spondents found us. They began an agi
tation at once, tilling the men and women
that no Spanish-speaking people would be
found in Hawaii, which, they said, was
inhabited solely by Chinese and Japanese.
A single man was found who lent a will
ing ear to their talk. This was Edward
Rendle, an American, who had previously
confessed that he did not intend going
to Hawaii, but had joined the others for
the sole purpose of gaining free transpor
tation to Oakland, where he has relatives.
This morning he had a fight with one of
the men on board, striking him with his
list, and was asked to quit thi train at
Ontario."
Alvis' statement was corroborated by
the Southern Pacific agent in charge of
the train and a dozen of the men them
selves, who stated that they were well
pleased with the prosper-ts held out by the
company. They told pathetic tales of the
hard times existing in Porto Hlco where
they say wages are exceedingly low.

LOS ANGELES
VAXCOUVER, B. C, Dec 13.â Advice*
from the Orient by the Empress of India
say: As the Canton Sails are overcrowded,
the China Mail states that the number
of prisoners is periodically decreased by
executions of nineteen. The prisoners
are beheaded on a vacant common in the
presence of vast couneourses of people,
who applaud the spectacles after the cus
tom prevailing In Paris during the days
of the French revolution. The execution
ers have been so busy of late that the
usual remuneration of half a dollar a head
has been reduced to 25 cents and yet there
are many candidates for the Job.
The Chiuo Shlmbun tells a remarkable
story to the effect that P.OOO Chinese re
siding in Java have decided to become
Japanese subjects, as their treatment by
the Dutch Is Intolerable. It is said that
arrangements were made with Japan by
these Chinese colonists prior to their
raturallzation by which Japan was to
send a force of police to Java for their
protectlon.
A disastrous fire Is reported from Can
ton. It broke out Jn the vegetable mar
kets and In four hours five hundred shops
and dwellings were destroyed. The
bodies of three victim? were recovered,
but it Is believed that many more were in
cinerated.
The charges acainst the allied troops of
cruelty and outrages have been lately re
newed* and it Is said that Jhe effect of the
conduct of the allied troops has been to
Intensify the hatred of the Chinese
against foreigners. The Japanese press
is taklnp the matter up, the official em
bargo against them having- been raised.
One Japanese paper contains a strong ap
peal to the Christian missionaries of
Japan, whom it accuses of standing idle
and silent spectators, while their faith Is
made to stink In the nostrils of the Orient
by the Inhuman excesses 6f those profess
ing it. Another says that the doings of
the Mongols under Cenghls have found
their counterpart in the villainous acts of
Christian soldiers at the close of the
nineteenth century. The Mongols boasted
openly that the right sleeves of their
tunics are dyed in the blood of Chinese
women and children, and it is declared
that the same lanpruage mig'ht truthfully
be employed regarding some of the allied
troops to-day.

NEW ORLEANS. Dec. 13.â The south
bound Illinois Central fast mail, due hero
at 7:15 p. m., wa<Â« hvld-up and robbed by
a lone train robber about one mile above
the upper limits of tiie city to-night. His
booty consisted of only one registered
mail pouch from Durant. Miss., and six
ther registered letters from points be
tween Cairo and New Orleans.* Conductor
Kinnebrew was shot in the groin and J.
C. Parker, railway mail clerk, had his
left eye powder burned by a shot directed
at hfs head. :
Tne robber got on the train, it is sup
posed, at aome point above the city, and
after pawing Kenner, the last stop be
fore the train arrive* in New Orleans, he
climbed over the engine and covered the
engineer and Arema.i and brought the
train to. a standstill. When the conductor
came forward to see what the trouble
was he was shot by the robber. R. h..
Uuldsbv. one of the railway mail clerks,
Ktuck his head out of the door and was
ordered to Jump down, which he aid.
Thf n the robber led the engineer, nreman
and GoldÂ»by toward the express car and
made one of them olow the side out with
a stick of dynamite which he nuppli<?<J.
This train carries no money and has no
pafe. The robber then made for the mall
car and there discovered Parker, who had
hidden the registered pouches. He shot
at him and then one of the pouches was
produced and the robber made off with it.
He uncoupled the engine from the train
and ran it to a point near Carroilton ave
nue where he abandoned it. The route
of the engine wa* marked by mall pouches
and letters which the robber threw or
dropped out as he escaped. The robber
wa* evidently well acquainted with rail
roading. His face was blackened and he
whs a man little less than six feet tall,
weighing about 1W> pounds. He took Con

LOME ROBBER
HOLDS UP TRAIN
TEXARKANA, Ark., Dec. 13.â A bold
rubbery on the Cottonbelt Railway oc
curred to-day at Bassetts, Tex., thirty
miles south of Texarkana, on the train
coming north, in which Postal Clerk John
N. Dennis was almost killed and the mall
pouches of the mail car rifled of their
contents. The amount stolen is not
known.
As the train left the Bassetts water
tank at 6 o'clock a. m. the express and
mall cars were separated on the train, but
the train crew soon had them cotlpled
again. In the run from there to Tex
arkaua the coaches were uncoupled twice
In a very mysterious manner. Upon the
arrival of the train here the United States
transfer clerk went to . the door of the
mall car and knocked for the postal clerk
to open it. No response was given. The
officials then forced an entrance and were
astonished to find the clerk, John N. Den
nis, stretched upon the floor, apparently
dead. An examination showed that the
registered pouches had been ripped open
and. robbed of their contents, the most
valuable of which was the Wayne through
pouch, containing a large number of val
uable packages. A physician was sent
for and it was found that Dennis was
alive, but unconscious. An ugly wound In
the top of his head told the story. Two
hours after he was taken to the hospital
he revived enough to give the details of
the robbery. Just as the train parted at
Bassetts tank Dennis went into the ves
tibule of the mall car to utir up the tire.
When he opened the vestibule door he saw
two men standing by the stove, one of
whom dealt him a terrible blow on the
head with a heavy tire shovel. The Hr,Â«t
blow felled him and he was then quickly
beaten into a senseless condition. He
knew nothing more until he was removed
to the Texarkana hospital. He is in a
critical condition.
Examination of the car showed that the
robbers gained entrance by crawling
through a small trap door through the
lloor of the vestibule. In this vestibule
is a crank with which a person can un
couple a car and It la believed it was the
Intention of the robbers to disconnect and
get control of both cars. It Is impossible
to tell how much they secured. .
There Is little to work on. as the men
could have left the car at three different
places before the train arrived here.
reached here at noon that two
suspects have been arrested at Naples,
near the scene of the robbery, but none
of the stolen packages were found.
Dennis is an old and trusted mail clerk.

DEMANDS OF THE
BALL, PLAYERS REJECTED
Magnates of the National League Re
fuse to Accept Proposals
Submitted.
NEW YORK, Dec. 13.â The National
Baseball League magnates, who have
been in session for the past three days at
the Fifth Avenue Hotel, put in another
busy day to-day, holding two sessions.
The proposition made to the league by
the committee from the Players' Protec
tive Association was the first business
taken up. A report on Wednesday's con
ference was presented to the magnates by
the league committee and the matter was
thoroughly discussed. After the magnatea
had been in session for about an hour
word reached the corridors downstairs
that the demands made by the players
had been thrown out part and parcel.
There was a hurried conference' between
Chief Zimmer, Clark Griffith and Hugh
Jennings, representing tne players' organ
ization, with the result that a note was
sent upstairs asking the magnates to
grant the 1 players another audience. The
magnates received the note and laid it
aside for future action.
One of the results of to-day's early ses
sion of the magnates was the passage of
an amendment to the constitution reduc
ing the number of directors from six to
four. Incidentally a new board was elect
ed, and for the tlrst time in many years
New York is represented on the board.
The new board will consist of Soden of
Boston, Brush of Cincinnati, Dreyfus of
Pitt3burg ajid Freedman of New York.
The entire national board of arbitration,
consisting of Young, Soden, Hrush, Hart,
Robinson and Rogers, was re-elected. The
committee on constitution will be com
posed of Rogers. Brush and Hart.
The magnates unanimously decided to
do away with the custom of early spring
practice trips to the South.
The second session finished without any
thing of importance being accomplished.
The umpire question was thoroughly dis
cussed, but was put over until the annua,
spring meeting. The magnates did not
consider the players' demand for a re
hearing of their case at the evening ses
sion. It probably will be. taken up to-mor
row.
BUT ONE AMERICAN TEAM
IS NOW IN THE RACE
Elkes and McFarland Tied for First
Place With ths Canadian Six-
Day Bicyclists.
NEW YORK; Dec. 13.â Narrowed down
to six sore, battered and strained teams,
the six-dav bicycle race in Madison
Square Garden has now become a con
test of nations. At midnight, at the be
ginning of the fifth day of the contest,
only one American team is left in the
race, Kikes and McFarland. who. with
Pierce and McEachern, the Canadians,
had at thut hour covered 1827 miles and
four laps. Babcock and Aarons and Tur
ville and Glmm had to withdraw as teams
in the eHrly hours Thursday morning on
account of the 'serious injuries received
by Aarons and Turville. Glmm and Bab
cock, however, were allowed to re-enter
the race yesterday afternoon to tight for
the seventh or last prize.
At 2 o'clock the score was as follows:

When l^avator. anS'-poumier, with Ransch
up and 15 to 1 in the betting, came scam
pering in first Ike a scared hare the win

on his previous race be did not call for
much. If in that event he paraded for
the handicapper's benefit. Mr. Brooks fell
as easy victim. Vulcain. Florizar and
Malav v.-f-ro ieavily played, th<Â» first
named, starter closing a 3 to 2 favorite.
Coburn with Vulrain made all the run

Florizar beaten for the place by the fa

tod most by the outsider's victory- He
â¢was said to have hold him out flat, besides
cashing J3W of tickets around the ring.
That class will tell in horse racing re

impressively. Golden Age. with 120 pounds

ting it looked as if Bernota might de
throne him. There were only two other
Ftarterj*. Janice and Tony Tapping. At the
etart Jnck Martin took Bernota out at a
dazzling clip, and as the stretch was
reached everything looked over so far as
the first horse was concerned. When tnid
way to the wire Bernota faltered and
Golden Ape sauntered by him. Then
O'Connor astride Jar.ice came with a rush,
eoir.pelling Coburn' to shake up Sam Hil
fireth's slashing colt to win by a neck in
1:2^+. a remarkably good performance.
The big crow -5 of spectators fared well.

A very liberal price was laid about An

LAVATOR, A 15 TO 1 SHOT, CAPTURES
THE DECEMBER HANDICAP GALLOPING
INDIANAPOLIS, Dec. 14.-The Sentinel
this morning says: Attorney General
Taylor, on behalf of the State of Indiana,
will file suit in the Superior Court of
Marion County this (Friday) morning,
asking the appointment of a receiver for
the Order of Chosen Friends, one of the
largest fraternal insurance association*
in the United State?
The filing of the suit will affect thirty
States of the Union, as the association has
been authorized to do business in that
number. Â¦-, Â¦
In the application for a receiver, which
is a voluminous document, the fact Is set
out that the association is Insolvent and
unable to meet the death claims now out
standing.
These claims aggregate about $300,000
and came to light through an examination
made by George U. Blngham, expert of
the Indiana insurance department, last
"Wednesday.' Immediately upen being ad
vised of the condition of the association
Auditor of State Hart notified T. B. IJnn,
supreme recorder of the ChO6en Friends,
that the order was insolvent and he would
at once make application for a receiver.
The utmost recrecy has been observed
in the preparation of the papers* to be
filed in the Supreme Court, because the
Auditor desired that Indiana be the first
State to appoint a receiver, as under the
law the first appointed takes priority
over any that may be appointed In other
States.
An examination instituted by the State
Insurance Department also revealed thRt
former Supreme Treasurer William B.
Wilson who has been In office since 1R95,
had defaulted to the amount of about $30.
000; Air. Wilson died last October, and the
order Is secured by a bond In one of the
bonding companies and will lose nothing
on account of this defalcation.
The order was organized about twenty
years ago and Indianapolis has always
been the headquarters. Among the States
that have councils are: California 116,
Nevada 4, Arizona 1. Colorado 2, Kansas
3, Montana 2, Oregon 1 and Washington 1.
California has the largest membership â
5131. The total memt>erBhip is 22,140.

Oakland Office San Kr.indsco Call,
HIS Broadway, Dec. 13.
Billy Delaney, the well-known trainer
and manager of prize-fighters, left to
night as the authorized agent of a new
sporting club shortly to be established
across the bay, and likewise, If current
report be true, to resume relations with
big Jim Jeffries, who has missed Delaney
since their reported falling out last sea
son.
Delaney will not say flatly that his mia
sion eastward is to again become the ma
jor domo of the Jeffries menage, but the
indications are so strong that the Califor
nlan has urgpd Delaney to come to him
that the guarded statements of the bluff
trainer are accepted as evidence of the
truth of the report which comes from
New York.
â¢ "I may return In a month and may re
main away longer." was the way Delaney
put it when he boarded the train at Six
teenth-street station.
"Yes. 1 shall look up the fighters," he
continued. "1 have credentials from a
new club in San Francisco that is well
backed and will be handled by men in
whom the public has confidence. I am
going to see if Terry McGovern wants a
light with a man I believe has a chance
against htm â I mean Marty McCue. Now.
McCue may not ce ab.e to. whip the
demon, McGovern, but he is clever and
would give a good account of himself. A
meeting between these men would be like
the Sullivan-Corbett fight. People said
Sullivan would hammer Jim into a corner
and pound him to a finish. They did not
give Corbett credit for cleverness enough
to keep out of such a mess until the re
sult of the contest was known. McCue is
a clever ring general and can protect Mm
self.
"As for Jeffries, well, we parted friends
last June. If he is properly handled the
big fellow will last ten years and will con
tinue to be the leader of them all.. Fitz
simmons cannot whip him if Jeffries goes
into the ring In condition. Jim should
tight at 220 pounds. The trouble has been
that he would insist upon too hard train
ing. Jeffries would undoubtedly make
every sacrifice to mee,t Fitzsimmons
again."

HICAGO. Dec. 13.â Terry McGovern
//if now the undisputed lightweight
VV > champion of the world. He
knocked out Joe Gans of Baltimore
after two minutes and five seconds
of fighting in the second round. Gans
put up a very poor exhibition and was
never In it at any stage of the game. Mc-
Govern started rushing him at sound of
the gong and never let up until Gans was
counted out. Gans never delivered an ef
fective blow during the fight, and for a
man of his reputation he made a light
which will gain him no friends among
lovers of true sport In the ring. George
Slier, the veteran referee, who presided
in the ring, said after Gans had be*-n
taken to his corner: "Gans put up a very
poor tight. That's all I have to say."
McGuvtjrn put up a clean, fast fight
from start to finish and is entitled to all
the credit of-a victory. He fought hard
and- fast, his blows went home straight
to thÂ« mark and if the fight is to be cried
down at all it is on account of the miser
able showing made by Gans. During the
first round he never attempted to mix up.
He never made an effort to use his left
counter, for which he is so famous, and
did nothing but back away with a scared
look on his face. In the second round he
attempted to tight a little at the opening,
but soon resorted to his backward march,
attempting no return blows and making 1
no effort to block the hot ones which Me-

rose to his left knee and remained In that
position until Siler tapped him on ths
shouuler, telling him that the fight waa
over and that he was a loser. He was
lifted and was able to walk In a feeble
manner to his corner.
As McGovern, smiling and wavln? his
hand, turned toward his corner, he was
picked up In the arms of his manager
and seconds and carried bodily to his
chair. In an Instant the ring was
thronged with wildly cheering McGovern
adherents, who gathered around the
Brooklyn man's corner and cheered him
again and again as McGovern, pantinir
a little from his exertions, but with no
marks of any kind, started to put on his
clothes.
"He only hit me once." said McGovern.
"and that was In the first minute of tha
first round. He pok*Â»d his left into my
mouth good and hard, but I knew I had
him on the next exchange."
Gans had no excuse to offer for his
quick defeat. His seconds, however, said
that Gana was overtrained and that his
stomach had been bad all day.
There was a loner delay after the. pre-
wound up the evening's gathering around
the festal board.

Time limit to Be Observed in This
When a piano dealer sells an average of
seven pianos per day he should be satis
fied. We desire to-day Just six good cus
tomers to purchase that number of the
remaining pianos on our floor. These are
mostly of the better grades and are the
cream of our stock. We also have still
several of the cheaper grades, and these
will only be offered for the balance of
this week. Our present quarters are for
rent and the goods must and will be dis
posed of before 9 o'clock Saturday even
ing so to tho^e of you who are waiting
until the last minute we would suggest
that you come in to-day and decide this
question once and for all time, whether a
piano will ever enter your home or not;
We have explained fully in this paper why
we are offering these great reductions,
but for the benefit of the careless we wish
again to state that we have other inter
ests in manufacturing industries which
require all of. our attention, and Saturday
evening will end this matter as far as we
are concerned. You can actually save
over $100 on any piano in the remaining
stock. Is that any object to you? If it is
you had better make up your mind, and
do it quick. Come in to-day at 230 Post
street, Hockett Bros. & Co., and let us
convince you of the truth of our state
ments. Store open day and night until

No man is truly wise who denies that
he ever made a fool of himself.
after "kangaroo figure." Smith was In
the witness chair and Mrs. Smith fixed
her eyes Intently on him. The witness
squirmed. He had reason to know what
Jt meant when his spouse gazed at him
with her "heavenlv blue orbs."
Foshay Walker, who represents Mr.
Smith, opened the case by calling the at
tention of the witness to the eightieth
charge of cruelty in the complaint, at the
same time handing the witness the com'
plaint for reference.
Judge Daingerfield intervened. "Walker,
in legal parlance, was leading the Â¦wit
ness, and the court sought to protect the
defendant.
"I wish to Inform you," said Judsre
Dain^ertield addressing Mrs. Smith, "that
litigants who elect to try their cases
without the aid of counsel are often at a
disadvantage, especially those who have
no knowledge of law. Have you ever
studied law?"
"I know enough about this case to try
It." responded Mrs. Smith tartly.
"Very well, proceed with the hearing,"
said Judge Dafngerfield.
The next question, which "was plainly
objectionable, but which Mrs. Smith al
lowed to slip Into the record, proved to the
court her helplessness in the face of the
legal technicalities that were constantly
to arise during the hearing. He there
fore went gallantly to her assistance and
cleared the record of its objectionable
features. Foshay Walker objected to the
action of the court. The only satisfac
tion h<* got was In the nature of an excep
tion allowed by the court, and thenceforth
during the day's proceedings Mrs. Smith
fortunately was given the advice of the
court.
The Smiths were married In '78, and
since '92 they have been living apart.
During these long years of separation
though the lady has frequently reminded
the cashier of her existence. These re
minders took the form of well-seasoned
letters, which Smith treasured with care.
Yesterday he offered them as evidence of
some of the mental cruelty he has been
obliged to endure at the hands of his wife.
Mrs. Smith's chirogrnphy is the worst
part of her letters. Judge Daingerfield
declared he was unable to decipher the
notes the lady penned and so did Smith's
attorney. Thereupon Mrs. Smith volun
teered to read her'communicatlons to her
husband, and, her offer being accepted,
she read with elocutionary effect eight of
the thirty-seven letters that help swell
the cruelty charge.
Mrs. Smith's "cruelty" covered many
sheets of paper and touched upon a
mvriad of subjects. She was in turn
poetic and prosaic, fearful and threaten
ing. Coldly critical at all times she spared
no one and volunteered her opinion on all
sorts and conditions of things and people.
Judge Hebltord came in for some warm
remarks at her hands. So did Nicholas D.
Smith, the uncle of her husband. Of him
she wrote, "The old rascal. If ever hi.
face comes In contact with our son's foot
ball hand he will never know what struck
him." But the most telling effects of the

be well to ask for Legislative permission to
use ballot machines at municipal elections.
These are being usod at elections in Eastern
States, and have been a pronounced success.
We would also ask your wlshÂ«Â»3 in regard to
tha policy of again submitting a constitutional
amendment to provide for the exemption of
public bonds from taxation. Vi hlle this amend
ment was defeated at the last election, the
majority against it was not large. Were It to
be again submitted, the subject again agitated,
and by conducting an educational campaign,
the result might be favorable.
The remainder of the session was de-'
voted to the discussion of needed legisla
tion. A draft of an amended bond act
and a draft of an act authorizing the levy
of a special tax lor specific public im
provements, upon vote of the people, were
referred to the judiciary committee.
As to the collection of license taxes in
municipalities by county authorities there
seemed but one opinion, and a resolution,
offered by City Attorney Partridge of San
Jose, that It be the sense of the league
that the county government act be so
amended that Supervisors shall not be
given the power to levy license taxes on
businesses within the limits of Incor
porated towns was adopted.
The delegates indulged in a heated dis
cussion of the question as to whether
town marshals or other officers should be
elected by the people or appointed by the
Board of Trustees In cities of the fifth and
sixth classes. On a straw vote the con
vention expressed its sense as in favor of
such appointment of both the Marshal and
the City Clerk.
Should jury trials be abolished in ca"?es
of violation of city ordinances? was a
question that developed radical differences
of opinion. After a long discussion a res
olution favoring legislation to provide for
Jury verdict upon a two-thirds vote, and
was adopted without opposition.
The session this morning will begin at
10 o'clock with a paper on "The Cost of
Producing Electric Current in Municipal
Plants," by Professor C. D. Marx of Stan
ford University. At 2 p. m. Mayor Phelan
will speak on the new charter.
SOME OF THE FIGURES IN THE
TRIAL OF THE SMITH DIVORCE
SUIT.
many letters were the pen pictures she
drew of the luckless husband.
"Mayer, the tailor." she wrote, "in
sulted our son by telling him he had a
long thin neck like yours and that his
shoulders stooped like yours. He wound
ed his feellnprs by saying he had a shape
like yours." In another letter she wrote.
"You miserable cur, ray blood boils when
I think you are the father of a son of
mine. If I discover you have any im
moral relations with any female I will
k!U you."
On the stand Smith told of the numer
ous acts of cruelty lie had suffered at the
hands of his wife. He told how she had
come to his office m the Southern Pacific
building, called him a thief and flung an
ink bottle at him. Of course the bottle
missed the mark. Mrs. Smith aimed for
the Smith head, but the bottle waa
smashed on the window sill and spilled
Its contents all over the floor.
But the crudest of all the cruel tale9
was the encounter with "our son" of the
football hand, which took place on Feb
ruary 16, 1898, in Smith's room at 30 Post
street.
"The boy came with his mother," said
Smith. "As usual sht began talking about
money and accusing me of all sorts of
things. The boy sprang at me and I
sprang at him. He caught my head like
a football under hl3 left arm and with
hia right he smashed me. I felt the blow.
Our son Is six feet tall and strong. AVc
fell on the floor. Then Mrs. Smith pro
duced a whip she carried and began beat-
Ing me on the head and shoulders. She
finally broke the -whip and thereupon
rushed out In the street yelling "Police!"
"My landlord came to the room," Smith
went on to say, "and he found me grap
pling with my son on the floor. 'Do you
want to right this to a finish?" he said.
'No.* I said, and thereupon he ordered the
boy to leave the house. The boy went."
Mrs. Smith let the duties of attorney
which she took upon herself rest lightly
on her shapely shoulders. She made no
objections and only interrupted the pro
ceedings twice. Once she begged "the
court to instruct her husband lit the
forms of good manners," for he had re
ferred to "our son" as "her son." And
once she asked that the court compel her
husband, who she "believed was either
chewing tobacco or gum," to speak plain
ly. Also she took it upon herself to cor
rect the witness. Smith declared under
oath that he had seen forty-four winters
come and go. "That's wrong, your Hon
or," said the lady; "my husband is 45
years old."
The complaint that Smith has filed cov
ers several pages of matter. In it he al
leges that on June 8, 1839, Mrs. Smith
charged him with being the associate of
female lepers. February 27, 1S99. she came
to his office, he claims, at 4 Montgomery
street, "and with all her vocal powers,
which are strong, she denounced plaintiff,
calling him a thief, accusing him of being
a thief, said he stole money from the
Southern Pacific, said she would kill him
and called him a miserable cur with a
shriveled body." June 15, 18?S, he says, she
came to his office accompanied by her
son. Armond C. Smith, and wife and son
assaulted the father â¢ and severely beat
him. She called him a liar and a tar flat
ruffian. February 16, 1S9S, she came to his
room at 30 Post street, accompanied by
h*r son. and horsewhipped the plaintiff:
alco called him the lowest cur and coward
that ever breathed. Later she caught him
at dinner and threw a plate of mush and
milk on his hair. When they were living
at the Grand Hotel, Berkshire and other
hostelrles he says she constantly an
noyed him, threatened to kill and maim
him, and unless restrained he declares she
will carry out her intentions.
In her answer Mrs. Smith sets up a gen
eral denial to all allegations made by her
husband, and quotes a letter in which she
says that she would protect his name
with her heart's blood, for his good name
meant her good name, which was all in
the world to her.
The case will go on on Tuesday morn
ing.

BERGIN'S RESIDENCE
GUTTED BY TWO FIRES
Blind and Defective Flue Causes
Damage to the Attorney's
House and Contents.
Presidio* Heights residents had two
chances last evening to turn out to a fire.
Shortly after 5 o'clock flames were dis
covered In the residence of Thomas I. Ber
gin. 2012 Jackson streA, one of the earliest
and most pretentious residences erected In
that section of the city. After a long flght
the fire was apparently subdued. Shortly
after the engines were called off a second
alarm from the same box was rung in.
The firemen had a long and hard battle
this time to conquer the flames, for they
seemed to come from a blind flue in the
walls. The source was finally traced to a
heater In the basement. The fire burned
its way through the walls, and together
with the water used played sad havoc
with the furniture and other elegant be
longings.
The damage cannot be estimated in dol
lars and cents, as Attorney Bergin had a
valuable collection of books and bric-a
brac which he had been gathering for
years, some of which cannot be replaced.
All of the morning session yesterday of
the convention of the League of Califor
nia Municipalities was devoted to a dis
cussion of street improvement laws. Gov
ernor Gage was unable to be present to
deliver an address and telegraphed his
regrets.
The discussion was based on a report of
the special committee appointed a year
ago to draft a street Improvement law
which might be submitted to the Legisla
ture in case the Vrooman act should be
declared unconstitutional. This report,
covering eleven typewritten pages and.
giving both sides of the questions at issue,
was Hied by Joseph Hutchlnson. president
of the Board of Trustees of Palo Alto,
who was chairman of the committee.
Mr. Hutchinsota explained the difficul
ties under which the committee labored
and the discouraging effect produced by
the Supreme Court decision coming in the
midst of the committee's deliberations in
the case of Byrne vs. Drain, that charters
supersede general laws, and in the case of
Hadley vs. Dague. in which the decision
takes the apparently paradoxical position
that the Vrooman act is constitutional in
principle, but that in its application in
any given case it may be unconstitutional.
"*As a result of this decision." said Mr.
Hutchlnson, "litigation is invited rather
than quieted. However, the Vroomon act
is not safe until the United States Su
preme Court has passed upon it, and our
attempt has been to draft a measure
which may be passed by the Legislature
as a concurrent act, its plan to be fol
lowed upon choice of municipalities so de
siring. In such event the State will not
be left without a street improvement law
should the Vrooman act finally be de
clared unconstitutional."
The report states the committee's inten
tion as follow*:
The proposed draft contains a clause to the
effect that the Vrooman act Â«hall remain In full
force and effect, and that the proposed new
law shall provide only an alternative or con
current scheme for street improvements. Mu
nicipal corporations affected by the act. which
would probably Include all corporations organ
lzetl under thf municipal Incorporations act of
1SS3 and its amendments, also the cities of San
ta Harbara, Sacramento, Eureka, porsibly
Napa as to some matters, and possibly Stock
ton. Ban Dieco and Ix>s Angeles, but would cer
tainly exclude San Francisco. Vallejo and all
other cities whose .charters contain valid pro
visions for a complete Â»ystrm-of street im
provements, could, if the act became a law,
take their choice as to proceedings for street
Improvements. If they prefer the Vrooman act
they can operate under It. If they preferthe new
act, they can operate under that. And the
operations under the new t:t would put in
motion a new set of experiments which would
undoubtedly be valuable. And if the Supreme
Court of the I'nited States should ultimately
hold the Vrooman act unconstitutional, we will
have in California already In operation an act
to take its place. If, on the other hand, the
Supreme Court of the United States should for
instance. Just after the adjournment of the
next Legislature of the State of California.
deÂ«-lde the Vrooman act to be unconstitutional,
the State will be substantially without any
street law for two years, unless a special ses
sion of the Legislature is called, unless some
such act as this Is passed by the next Legis
lature.
The principal objections to the Vrooman
act are stated as follows in the report:
Firstâ The power lodged in a majority of the
frontage affected by proposed Improvements of
certain classes to atay -all proceedings Indefi
nitely by a protest tends to. put a complete stop
to all work of those classes.
Secondâ The fact that contractors bidding on
street work cannot bid on a cash basis, and
always have to face the question of litigation
to collect their bills, tends to Increase the price
of all street improvements about 33 1-3 per cent
beyond the price for which the same work
could bo done by private contract. In the
agKregate, this means enormous loss to the
public.
The committee proposes to afford relief
in the new law by a plan of confirmatory
proceeding by which the legality of street
improvemnt measures will be passed upon
in advance by the courts. At the same
time the power of a majority of the front
age to stay all proceedings by a protest
Is taken away and the right of property
owners to appear in court and challenge
the confirmatory proceedings Is substi
tuted. The second objection is met in the
proposed law by a provision analogous to
the rule now in force with regard to the
construction of public works under bond
Issues, which forbids the letting of any
contract until the bonds are sold and the
money Is in the treasury. Under decree of
court the assessment iff to be levied and
the money collected and placed In a spe
cial fund "before the street contract is let.
It is admitted by the committee that there
are grave objections to tnis plan, the tax
payer preferring generally to keep the
money in his pocket until the work is
done, even If as a result the Improvement
cost him a third more.
In drafting the proposed law the com
mittee followed suggestions obtained from
the laws of Illinois and Iowa.
After a prolonged discussion the con
vention adopted the following resolution:
Resolved, That a vote of thanks be extended
to the committee appointed to draft a new
street law for their laborious task; and
Resolved, That the same committee bo con
tinued, with instructions to communicate with
the various legislative bodies who are mem
bers of this organization, with the request that
within two weeks they report to the commit
tee, statlnR their objections and proposed
amendments to the law In its present shape.
The committee 6hall take the reports and by
giving the cities of larger population the
greater consideration, shall draft and have pre
sented to the comlnfr Legislature the result of
the inquiries in the shape of a concurrent street
law.
The report of the committee of legisla
tion was presented by Senator E. K. Tay
lor. City Attorney of .Alameda, at the be
ginninpr of the afternoon session. Among
Its recommendations were the following:
It appeare that cities of the sixth class have
no authority to establish fire limits. It would
bo well to amend the charter for such cities
by providing euch power.
We would also BUg-gest the propriety of
amending the municipal elections acts by giv
ing the board of trustees and councils author
ity to reduce the number of election officers.
Eight officers of election In each precinct are
hardly necessary In municipal elections and are
a source of considerable expense. It might also

MUSCLE _ANDJ? 0T FAT.
Wkat Thin People Need to Bound Off
the Corners.
What thin folks need is flesh or muscle,
r.ot fit-
To be Eymmetrlca.1 and properly propor-
tioned every person should have a cerraln
tiaount of excess fiesh, but to be plump
coes not necessarily mean to be fat.
Fat is undesirable; it clogs and retards
the action of the muscles, interferes with
the healthy action of the heart and lungs
and when very excessive, predisposes loo
tatty degeneration of vital organs, to say
nothing of the discomfort resulting from
too much adipose tissue.
Common stnse would suggest that if one
wishes to become fleshy a.nd plump the
thir.g moet needed would be flesh forming
foodâ that i5. albuminous foods like eggs,
k*rÂ»?f, oatmfal, etc.
Tne kinds of food which malce flesh axe
the foods we have on our tables every
day; but the trouble is that our stomachs
fiom weakness or derangement of some
kind do not promptly and properly digest
it.
Really, the principal reason so many peo-
ple remain thin Is because their stomachs
So not properly and completely digest and
CFFim'.late the fleph forming beefsteak and
Â» p;--s we eat every day.
There are thousands of such people, and
they are really dyspeptics, although they
may net suffer any particular pain or in-
convenience from their stomachs.
If EUCb persons and all thin people
would lake- after their meals some simple
and natur.il digestive, like Stuart's Dys-
t^-psia TabMfc. the food would be quickly
ciRested and the proper degree of p!ump-
pea* vtry socn result because these tab-
lets are prepared exact'y for that purpose.
They dipef=t every variety of flesh forming
food, which is the real reason why they
Â«> quickly build up and strengthen thin,
Â«lyppeptic men and women.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets cure every
f >rm of indigestion on this common-sense
plan, that they thoroughly digest the food
promptly, piving strength to every nerve
Â«r:d orcan in the body, and the weakened
rtomach a chance to rest and recover Its
natural vigor. Nothing further Is required
to cvte any stomach trouble, except can-
c<r of thÂ«? stomach. They make thin, dys-
prrtic people strong:, plump and well.
This excellent preparation it sold at 50c
for full-Elsed treatment by all drupeisls
in T'nited States, Canada and Great
Britain.

The people of Oakland have defeated all of the pro
posed amendments to the town's charter. Perhaps the
voters took both bitter, political factions at their word
and refused to hazard the danger of giving either
more power.
It would be wise for the people of Oakland, to end
their contest with the Contra Costa Water Company
before the corporation owns the town. The value of
the company is increasing, by expert. testimony, with
mushroom growth every day.

CALIFORNIANS IN WASHINGTON
The total arms-bearing population of
Europe is about 33.000,000 men.
It is to be borne in mind, moreover, that the in
crease in numbers has been accompanied by a dc-
j \A ANIFOLD and important as are t>e measures
/ \ before Congress at this session, it is to be
* * hoped time will be found to devise and enact
an immigration restriction bill which will adequately
j protect the country from undesirable immigrants.
| The passage of such n bill may be regarded as one of
urgency, for if it be not enacted this winter we can
hardly expect the enactment for a year to come, and
in that time we may suffer much injury from the lack
of it.
Reports from the East are to the effect that im
migrants are flocking into the country in large num
bers. It is said the steerage of vessels coming across
the Atlantic is crowded with passengers, and the offi
cials charged with the duty of scrutinizing the new
comers are almost overwhelmed with work. The ar
rivals are in excess of the aggregate for many a sea
son, and there is every reason to believe there will be
an enormous influx next spring unless something be
done to check it. Â»
For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1000, the num
ber of immigrants amounted to 520,000; in 1899 they
numbered 341,000; for 1898, 229,000; for 1897, 230,000;
for 1896, 343.000; for 1895, 279,000. It will be seen
that the increase during the past fiscal year over the
arrivals of the previous years was very large. This
year will show an even greater increase. It appears
that immigration is approaching the great magnitude
ir reached during the industrial boom of 1882, when
the total number of foreigners who came to the coun
try to profit by high wages exceeded 788,000.

Such a petition merits the support of the Legisla
ture, of Boards of Trade, industrial associations and
all other organizations that arc charged with the
duty of promoting the welfare of the people. At this
juncture there is hardly any problem more vital to
Cilifornia than that of preserving her woods and con
serving her flood waters. It is, moreover, a problem
demanding an immediate solution. Every year the
State suffers a lo?s of many thousands of dollars by
the waste of her forests, and the loss throughout the
nation runs up to many millions annually. We are
barbarians so far as forestry is concerned, and jt is
high time for us to act like civilized people.
Among the ladies of the State who have turned thtr.r
attention to this issue are those who compose "the
California Club." From a circular recently issued it
appears the c!ub intends to make a resolute effort to
induce Congress to take action toward forest preser
vation without further delay. The circular calls for
signatures to a petition which, after setting forth the
benents to result irom a proper care of our forests
and the evils resulting from negligence, goes on to
Bay: "In view of these incontestable facts the Cali
fornia Club beseeches the United States Government
on behalf of her own interests to make an appropria
tion of money to be expended in the accomplishment
of the objects named in the above preamble, and the
club urges on all citizens, all organizations and legis
lators, both State and national, to join in commend
ing an'd furthering this course of action."
T~) V all who have "an intelligent interest in th?
\ problems of forest preservation in this State
there will be felt no little gratification in the
efficient help given to the campaign of education on
the subject b\' the ladies. Woman's work is always
potent, and this is an issue to which she may well di
rect her influence and her energies. It is not going
to be an easy task to procure the establishment and
the maintenance of a comprehensive and scientific
systeia ot forest preservation by either the State or
the ration, and consc-qucr.tlv the assistance of every
strong and earnest any m the work will be hailed with

ofllce swells, the amount to almost three
fifths of the whole. The majority of the
national income is derived from voluntary
contribution and indirect taxation. Pav

he should return to his native country
the fact that he has been an American

iipon a general policy of impounding anarchists within
the countries to which they belong, that each Govern
ment may police and watch its own contingent.
As far as known but one native American anarchist
has ever been known, and that was Parsons, hanged
for the Haymarket murders in Chicago.
We surely would be disquieted if in any other coun
try theec people were permitted to threaten and plan
the stealthy murder of the officers of this republic,
and we cannot expect any less anxiety abroad when
crimes sp^inst executives are approved by the same
clnss of people on our soil.
The President of the United States has nothing to
do with the administration of the local laws, which
regulate expression and publication. These laws dif
fer in different States, and we have never had a gen
eral interpretation of the limits of free speech. By
s. general principle the utterance of threats against life
ard property is not regarded as a proper and lawful
enjoyment of the liberty of speech. When these
threats are uttered against persons in another coun
tiy a cimcuhy appears in the way of their regulation
I." local \z\x. Such threats might involve the Federal
Government. For instance, ii public meetings were
licld in considerable numbers and in many parts of
this country in which threats were made, and ap
plauded, against the life of the President of France,
*7Ti the people doing 1 this claimed the right to peace
ably assemble and indulge such freedom of speech un
der the f.r.-t amendment to the Federal constitution,
t! ere is no doubt Lut a Federal question would
be raided requiring an interpretation of that amend
ment, which would be called by anarchists interference
with the freedom of speech, for which Alexander Horr
fcnter.ced the President to death. The question is a
riitTicuit cr.e. The presence of Jarge numbers of for
eign anarchists in this country may well constitute a
xrennce that will some time require the attention of
cur people.
At a meeting held by them recently in New lork
City five hundred are said to have been present. It
was ostensibly held as a benefit for the family of
Bresci. the assassin of King Humbert. One of the
speakers, named Alexander Horr, approved of assas
sination, and said they would kill President McKinicy
"if he attempted to interfere with free speech."
SINCE the Haymarket affair in Chicago the an
archists ih this country have been rather quiet.
The assassination of the King of Italy seems.
however, to have inspired new activity among those
misguided people, and they are again asserting them-
Sclvcs, taking advantage of their peculiar interpreta
tion cf the laws of this country.
AN ANARCHIST THREAT.
' The prevailing sentiment among conservative Re
publicans, at any rate, is very well expressed by the
Baltimore American in saying: "This is not the time
to pass upon this question of Southern representation.
Causes are pending in the Federal courts testing'the
i legality of negro-disfranchisement, and when they shall
have been determined it will be time enough to think
about retaliation. Now the sections dwell together in
amity, and the relationship should not be disturbed.
So far as the matter of a general reapportionment is
concerned, we believe it may best be settled by raising
the basis so as to keep the House down to its present
number, and without changing the numerical repre
sentation now enjoyed by the several States."
It seems to be conceded no apportionment of the
kind proposed by Crumpacker could be enacted this
session. Congress will be too busy and the session
too short to undertake the passage of a measure that
would be fought by all sorts of tactics known to par
liamentary minorities. Therefore if there is to be any
determined effort made to restrict the representation
from the South, the fight will go over to the next Con
gress and there will be no apportionment at all this
winter. Such a result, however, is hardly expected,*
for as yet there has been no evidence of an inclination
on the part of the Republican press or Republican
leaders to force a fight on the issue.

In the States not included in the tables there will
be no change from the present number of representa
tives. Under the present apportionment what are
known as ''Southern States" have 142 votes in the
Electoral College, while the remaining States have
305. Under the Crumpackcr bill the South would
have but 134 electoral votes, against 321 in the North
and West.
The issue is a perplexing one. The language of the
constitution apparently leaves no other course to bÂ«
pursued than that of making the apportionment upon
the principle of the Crumpacker bill, and yet many
of the foremost authorities hold a different view. It
\i known that neither the President nor any emi
nent Republican leader in either House has favored
a reduction of representation from the South, vvhil*
many of the most influential papers of the country
have strongly opposed it.
WHILE it is not at all likely a change will be
made in the proportion of representation from
the Southern States should an apportionment
bill be enacted this winter, it is certain the question
will come up for debate. A bill has been already in
troduced by Crumpackcr. of Indiana which has for its
plain purpose the limitation of the number of repre
sentatives from the South in accordance with the
second section of the fourteenth amendment to the
constitution. The bill provides for increasing the
membership of the House from 357 to 365/ so that
under its terms the increase or decrease in members
of different States would be as follows:
THE CRUMPACKER BILL.
by means of a separate wire. At the samo
time it reverses {he motion of the warn
ing boat until the lever becomes again
disengaged. If. after tha boat has re
sumed the direction of the ehlp. its feeler
should once more run against an obstacle,
the whole operation is repeated. In ihe
meantime the ship would have ample
time to slow up or stop, thua avoiding a
collision. If two ships whose courses
cross one another should both be provid
ed with warning boats it is expected that
the forklike feelers of the one will catch
tho cable of the other and convey tho
signal to its respective ship. The warning
boats are only to be used in fogÂ»ry
weather or at night, particularly in much
frequented sea highways.
OBECCHIONI, an Italian engineer,
has invented a contrivance for tha
prevention of collisions upon the
high seas. In its main feature
the invention consists of a small
boat constructed after the pattern of the
Whitehead torpedb, which is connecte.-l
with the ship by means of two cables an.l
precedes it at.-a distance of 400 to 500
meters. The warning boat is propelled by
electricity generated upon the ship and
conducted to the motor by means of tho
cables. At the front end of the waxnlnjj
boat there is a forklike feeler which, in
case^of contact with any solid obstacle,
engages by means of a lever an electric
alarm, which is communicated to the ship

From this we may conclude that the kind of aca

best for the other man's academy.
We are of opinion, too, that in a high sense the
same is true of a great university, and that President
Wheeler's practice at Berkeley is different from his
preaching to the editors. We are of the opinion that if
his engineering department should set up caricatures
of Mrs. Hearst's building plans and deride her taste
in architecture there would be vacancies. So, if the
art department of a newspaper girded at its editorial
policy the directing mind would direct a change in
that branch of the business.
If Dr. Wheeler would try running a newspaper on
the plan of his analogy with what he calls academic
freedom he would be involved in a confusion com
pared with which the labyrinth was a straight line.
The work of many minds goes into the harmonious
whole of each issue of a metropolitan newspaper, but
it is conformed to the one controlling wiH.
In like manner the New York Herald was the crea
ture of the will of the elder Bennett, and among the
modern press, in the newer cities, the Chicago
Tribune was the classroom in which Joseph Medill
ta.ught, and the Times was the school set up in Chi
cago by Wilbur F. Storey. The news in a paper is
made up of what men do, in their individual capacity
or in the aggregate as nations, and of what happens
tc men as a result of manifestation of the power of na
ture, in fires and famines, tempests and temblors.
This news should be given impartially and as fully
as is necessary to inform the reader. It should neither
he faked nor sophisticated. The newspaper manager
who changes or invents news is guilty of a serious
rroral forgery, for which the law should provide ade
quate punishment. The editorial page of a news
paper, its classroom, its pulpit, its blackboard, re
flects the policy, inculcates the principles and pro
motes the mission of the one mind that controls the
paper.
After him some time passed before another jour
nalistic philosopher appeared. It is true that Fenno,
:n New York Cit}*, and the old Telescope and Gazette
and Timepiece fitfully fulfilled the educating function
of the press, but a close examination does not con
vince that such was the master motive of Fenno and
those publications. But when Greeley appeared, with
the Tribune as his organ, there began the most won
derful education of the American people ever accom
plished by one newspaper. Yet it was the work oi
one man. the impression of a single will. When his
two disciples, Henry J. Raymond and Charles A.
Dana, left him and went, one to the Sun and the
other to found the New York Times, though they
became personal and business rivals of Greeley they
followed his method. As long as Raymond lived the
Times taught .editorially his belief of things and his
view of politics, and "the little villain," as Greeley
called him, never departed from that method to the
moment of his death on the doorstep of his office.
So it was with Dana. The Sun shone in the reflected
light of his intelligence and his malice until both were
quenched in death.
Benjamin Franklin was the first American journal
ist of that kind. He felt it his mission to impart
philosophy, thrift and economy to his countrymen,
and did it as the owner and editor of the Saturday
Evening Post.
But the most successful educators among American
newspapers have been those founded or controlled by
men who have felt the impulse of a mission in the
-.vorld, and have chosen to preach and teach it through
the columns of a newspaper.
Dr. Wheeler, in his address to the country editors,
?cemed to go searching for an analogy between the
newspaper and the college. In doing this he flouted
at the idea of one will controlling the policy of a paper
or a university, and spoke vaguely of the freedom,
academic and journalistic, necessary to the success and
usefulness of the press and the college. From the
newspaper side of it the analogy is unreal and im
possible. The newspaper has a double function â to
print the news, and influence public opinion by its edi
torial expression. In this latter office the press is an
educator, and therein the press takes rank with the
teacher.
THE last meeting of the California Editorial As
sociation was made interesting by the addresses
of the presidents of the two universities, Drs.
Jordan and Wheeler. Each gave his views about the
function of the press, and each was in his way interest
ing and instructive. The press has become a mighty
factor in our modern life and has come to deserve
study, as an institution, a force, that affects the actions
oi men, and to a degree influences the destiny of na
tions. Whenever anything appears in the world that
can influence the relations of men and of nations, it
becomes the subject of scientific investigation. The
press has reached that point. It does good and it
works evil. Like the old myth of the prince of the
powers of the air, it has benefits and harm to dis
pense, and they fall upon individuals and the com
munity.
The good and evil done by a newspaper depends
vpon the one will that guides and controls it and fixes
its policy. This will may in some cases be the aggre
gate mind of an editorial council, but, if so, the ag
gregation of views must be brought to unity. Or
the control may Ire one mind only. There can be no
newspaper success, nor influence, if the paper be lack
ing in this unity of control.

SAD STORY OF A BOSTON SEMICOLON.
7*
There is gloom in Boston hotels, all becausfe of a wretched little semicolon.
Nobody, not even a guest, can get a drink in a Boston hotel after 11 p. m., and
all on account of a miserable little semicolon. Theater parties after the show
sit sullen and thirsty in the restaurants of the Boston hotels and abominate a
pestiferous little semicolon. The hotel-keepers, who pay $2000 for their licenses,
are thinking of calling on the Legislature to extirpate that deceitful little semi
colon, j >
This is the story of the semicolon: In 1S73 the Great and General Court
parsed this statute:
Xo sale of spirituous or intoxicatins liquor shall be made between the hours of II
at night and 6 In the morning, nor during the Lord's day, except that if the licensee
Is also licensed as an Innholder he may supply such liquor to guests who have resorted
to his house for food or lodging. *
Give heedful note to the comma after "morning," a kindly and hospitable
comma, which permitted the "licensed lnnholder," at least, to comfort the
parched throats of his guests between 12 p. m. and 6 a. m.
In 18S1 the statutes were consolidated and somebody, careless copyist, humor
ist or zealous prohibitionist, plucked away the innocent comma and set a blis
ter of a semicolon there. Notice the difference:
Xo sale of spirituous or intoxicatins liquor shall be made between the hours of 12
at nleht and 6 in the morning; nor during the Lord's day, except that If the license*
is also licensed as an innholder he may supply such liquor to gruests who have resorted
to his house for food or lodglnsr.
In 1SS5 the hour was changed from 12 to 11, but the comma was not restored.
Obviously the fatal little semicolon shuts out the innkeeper from his former
right of selling liquor to guests between 11 p. m. and 6 a. m., and merely per
mits him to sell on Sunday. -This week the Supreme Court of Massachusetts
has so construed the statute. The semicolon has overruled the Great and
General Court.
This anecdote teaches us the moral and legal value of punctuation, which
some of us were Inclined to look down upon In our younger days.â New York

Tho first annual convention of the Wa
ter and Forest Association of California
began yesterday ln the maple room of the
Palace Hotel. The members present were
representative of all Interests in the
State. AJthougrh the association is but a
year old it numbers nearly 5000 members
and the officers are confident that with
in another year the present membership
will be doubled.
In the morning' the executive committee
was busily engaged ln preparing reports
for the afternoon session, President Wil
liam Thomas appointing the following
gentlemen to act as committees: Revision
of by-lawsâ A. J. Pillsbury, J. . D. Works,
A. Briggs; credentialsâ S. Craig:, W. H.
Porterfield, P. F. Wood.
The members of the executive commit
tee present were: President William
Thomas, Arthur Briggs, J. B. Lippincott,
W. E. -Smythe. Sciplo Craig, J. D. Works,
W. C. Ralston. A. J. Pillsbury. U M.
Holt, E. B Willis and W H. Mills, the
last five also being the committee ap
pointed on legislation.
The president briefly outlined the work
to be accomplished and said it was of.
vital importance to the welfare of the
community that the waters and forests of
California should be conserved and pre
served. The association had been un
able to secure any financial aid from the
last State Legislature and had been com
pelled to rely upon private assistance, lie
said further:
San Francisco subscribed $10,000, and I am
proud to say that not a single subscriber had
any interest in the work of the association
other than that of public spirit and the benefit
of the State. The United States Geological
Survey and Department of Agriculture co
operated in the work of the engineers during
the season, and for each dollar we spent the
federal Government expended a similar sum.
The federal Government has saved the eseo
ciatlon considerable expense, end the two uni
versities aleo helfed, and we hope to carry on
the good work.
All other States bear the expense of con
serving waters and protecting the forests, and
this State should do the same. We will ask
the coming Legislature for aid. and we are
assured that the Federal Government will al
low $55,000 a year to the Geological Survey and
Department of Agriculture for this State, If
our Legislature will vote a similar sum.
The president then gave the details of
the present membership, sho-wlng that
prominent men in all walks of life were
Interested ln the work of the association.
Treasurer Dohrmann reported that the
total receipts from all sources during the
year were $18,080 80 and the expenses $15.
244 93, and after paying 1 outstanding 1 ac
counts the balance on hand was $460 34.
The reports of the president and treas
urer were adopted and the convention
then listened with great Interest to the
account of the work of the Geological
Survey as presented by J. P. Lippincott.
resident hydrographer for California of
the United States Geological Survey.
The report of Mr. Lippincott was as fol
lows:
HYDROGRAPHYâ Observations of dally die

River at Red Bluff; the Stanislaus River at
Oakdale; the Salinas River near Salinas; the
Tuolumr.e River at La Grange; tb,Â« San Joa
quin River at Herndon; the Klnate River at
Red Mountain; Little Rock Creek near Palm
dale; the Santa Ana River near Redlands; Lytle
Creek near Rlalto, and the Mojave River at
Victor. Records are also being furnished, with
out charge to the Geological Survey, on the
Kern River near Bakersfleld by the Kern
County Land Company; the San Gabriel River
near Azusa by H. F. Parkinson, and the Sweet

Merced River near SneUings, Stony Creek near
Elk Creek, Cache Creek at Lower Lake, and on
numerous tributaries of the Salinas River.
INVESTIGATION OF KINGS AND SAN
JOAQU1N RIVER?â Two parties spent the
summer ln the basin of the Kings and San
Joaquln rivers, one party ln charge of B. G.
Hamilton and the other ln charge of H. E.
Grefn. Large power possibilities were found
on Kings River and also a reservoir site of
223.000 acre-feet capacity. Estimates on the
installation cf a power house and pumping
plant were made by Lewis A. Hicks. Well ob

ample supply of underground water, good ln
quality, and at an average depth not to ex

The State Legislature will also be asked
to paps a resolution to request the Sena

introduce bills in Congress asking for an
appropriation of $2M,000 for Irrigation sur

Congress will also bf asked to reserve
all unsold public forest'lands In the State,
to establish a more. efficient forest patrol
and to adopt a national policy of scientific
forestry, to encourage the growth of tim

forest lands and to make stringent the
laws for the prevention of forest fires.
The various bills recommended by the
committee on legislation were adopted

that W. B. Fritch served one year In the
Fresno County jail for having counter
felt money In his possession.
As father and son occupied the same
room it was presumed, that the son was
cognizant of what was going on, and he.
as well as his father, was arrested and
lodged in the county Jail.
The discovery of the counterfeiter's
den was made through the carelessness of
William Benton Fritch in sitting by the
window while w : orking on the coins. He
was seen by some of the workmen on the
postofflce building, and the special agent
was notified.
The elder Fritch said that he had not
passed any counterfeit pieces. He had
almost made up his mind yesterday
morning, he said, to melt all the bad
coins and abandon his attempt at making
money, and he regretted that he had not
done so.
years ago, ar.d that they had been living:
in the Stevenson street residence for
about six months. During the whole of
that period the father had teen experi
menting on counterfeiting coins, and bad
just perfected his t-rstcm by molding the
tint Datch, consisting of -f 3320 in ten dol
dar pieces The pieces looked like silver,
and were ready to be plated with gold,
the battery and the plating mixture be
ing found in the room ready for use.

Mated that Glenn and Colusa counties are ex
ceedingly favored in their natural resources.
Reservoir sites have been found and surveyed
which demonstrate the possibility of irrigating
the mountain valleys of Glenn County on an
exceedingly conservative commercial basis, and
it is confidently believed that It is possible to
build up a great Irrigation community in the
Sacramento Valley by perfection of the works
of the central irrigation district and the con
struction of a mill site reservoir, capable of
supporting a population of over 100,000 people.

Cache Creek as follows: Indian Valley elte,
40.000 acre-feet; Cl*ar Lake, 80.000 acre-feet;
making a total available supply annually of
120,000 acre-feet at a conservative cost. The
economy of constructing these works on the

very great. On the basis ot population in

UNITED States Secret Service
Agent George W. Hazen and Op
erators Mofitt and Montgomery
made a most important capture
yesterday of a dangerous coun
terfeiter, together with $3320 in counter
felt ten dollar pieces, a sack full of plas
ter molds, a reeding machine, crucible,
files and other tools used in making bad
money.
The ten dollar pieces are the best coun
terfeits Mr. Hazen has ever seen, the im
pression, reeding and milling being per
fect. The only defect is that they are light
in weight.
For the past week Agent Hazen and
Operators Moffltt and Montgomery had
been watching the rear of a frame build
ing at 5uO Stevenson street. They had
been concealed in a lookout on the roof
of the new postofflce builalng, from
which point, with the aid of opera glasses,
they had been able to see a mlddie-aged
man tiling coins at a window in a back
room of 5C0 Stevenson street on the sec
ond floor. A search warrant was obtained
from United States District Judge de
Haven Â¦vyesterday morning, and the agent
and the operators resumed their seats in
the private box on the postoltice build
ing and focused their glasses on the
show. Soon the counterfeiter appeared at
the window, where the light was good,
and began the work of filing the counter
feit ten dollar pieces. The agent and his
assistants immediately went to the house,
and without going through the formality
of ringing the bell, broke down the door,
ran upstairs, smashed In the door of the
counterfeiter's room and were upon him
before he could have had the slightest
inkling of what was happening. The
counterfeiter stood at the window with
the file In his right hand and several
cigar boxes full of counterfeit coins in
front of him.
So sudden was the onset and so great
the surprise that the counterfeiter made
no attempt at resistance. Having been
caught red-handed he acknowledged his
guilt, but pleaded that his son was not
concerned In the business. He gave his
name as William Benton Fritch and his
age as 41 years. Operator Moffltt in a
few minutes brought In the son, who gave
his namo as Emmett Kenton Fritch, aged
18 years. KiÂ«mett works In Westerfeld's
bakery on Market street as a baker.
The father said he and his son arrived

The exiled priest Gioberti (.1843) pro
foundly stirred the hearts of his country
men by his glowing picture of what a
united and progressive Italy could do for
humanity. He advocated a federal union
under the Pops as president and arbitra
tor. Another leader of this party of re
form, as contrasted with the party of
revolution, the more practical Balbo, in
his "Hopes of Italy" (1S44), accepted con
federation as the solution of the problem
of union, but pointed out with clearness
that the greatest obstacle to its attain
ment was the presence of Austria. It
was hopeless to try to expel Austria, by
force, and unwise to seek outside help to
do It, but the break-up of the Turkish em
pire was only a question of time, and
when that came they should unite to sup
port Austria's expansion in that quarter
and in return she might relinquish Lom
bardy and Venetia. Two years later came
D'Azegllo's ringing appeal for internal
reforms as the necessary preparation for
independence.
The irreconcillaBle antagonism between
the programmes of the revolution? ry and
of the reform party, the one striving for
a consolidated republic arising from the
ruins of the existing governments, the
other aiming at a federal union of these
governments minus Austria, insured the
failure of the Italian cause in the great
year of revolutions, 1849.
At first sight the Italy of 1850 was merely
the restoration of the Italy of 1S15, and it
seemed as if no progress had been made
In thirty-five years, but a closer observa
tion revealed a striking exception to the
uniformity of despotism prevailing after
1815. In the kingdom of Sardinia under
Victor Emmanuel despotism was not re
stored, and the young king in the recent
crisis had shown himself In warm sym
pathy with Italian aspirations. The pro
gressive spirit in Piedmont was rein
forced by the presence of many political
refugees from the other states. It was of
immense significance for the future that
the King was able t9 discern and make
use of the matchless abilities of Count
Cavour, a statesman and diplomatist who
stands on the same level of greatness as
Bismarck. Devoted to the unification of
Italy, he was convinced that it could be
accomplished only by building up a pow
erful northern kingdom. The first step to
this end was to develop the resources of
the kingdom by stimulating agriculture,
building railroads and negotiating com
mercial treaties. Yet, as Sardinia would
not be strong enough unaided to expel
Austria, suitable alliances must be made,
and the first condition of securing them
would be to make the alliance of Sardinia
worth haying.
The approach of the Crimean war gave
him the desired opportunity, v.-hlch hÂ» em
braced with gTeat boldness. If Austria
should join with England and France
against Russia In behalf of Turkey, the
assistance of Sardinlamlght be used to in
duce Austria, in case she received some
territories from Turkey, to give up Lom
bardy and Venice to Sardinia; if Austria
failed to Join in the alliance the help of
Sardinia would be all the more welcome to
Ergland and France, and the chance of
assistance in return too good to be lost.
Carried through In the face of much oppo
sition by the Liberals, Cavour's policy In
joining "France and England in the war
secured the admission of Sardinia to the
congress of Paris in 1836 as one of the
powers of Europe. The tremendous step
in advance turned all eyes toward the lit
tle kingdom as the hope of Italian unity.
A vital factor In the situation was the
disposition of Napoleon III to promote the
reconstruction of Italy, and to attach the
peninsula by gratitude to his political
leadership. In 1S5S Cavour was invited to
meet Napoleon at Plomblere*. Napoleon
made a vertral agreement with him as fol-
That the work of the powers at Vienna
should all be undone In less than two
generations and the apparently insuper
able obstacles to union overcome is one of
the most remarkable facts of our century,
and far more surprising than the unifica
tion of Germany. In Germany the
obstacles were the rivalry of Prussia and
Austria and the reluctance, of the princes
to sacrifice their independence. The sit
uation in Italy, on the other hand, was far
more complicated. In the north the Em
peror of Austria ruled the kingdoms of
Lombardy and Venice and controlled the
duchies of Tuscany, Modena and Parma,
and in the south the King of the two
Sicilies was equally eubmisslve to Aus
trian dictation. In addition to these dif
ficulties was the perplexity whether the
united Italy of the future should be a
federal or a centralized stateâ that is, like
Germany or like Franceâ and, finally,
whether it should be republican or mon
archical. Obviously these were prob
lems that could not be solved by delibera
tion and whose ultimate solution would
have to come from war, the "grand de
cider of dusty and old titles." In the
meantime, for thirty years Italy was sub
divided under the despotism of native and
foreign princes, all subservient to Met
ternich, while amid persecution and in
exile Italian patriots agitated and plotted
for union, constitutional government and
the expulsion of the foreigner.
The great prophet and apostle of this
agitation was Joseph Mazzini, who lived
in London in exile. Early In the '30s he
organized the society of "Young Italy" to
work for the overthrow of all the existing
governments of Italy and to establish a
republic by means of an "educational
campaign," to be followed by insurrec
tions. The ceaseless energy and per
sonal inspiration of Mazzini made "Young
Italy" a powerful factor in the regenera
tion of Italian public spirit. The definite
ness of his programme clarified public
opinion and inspired men of conservative
instincts who were repelled by his preach
ing of insurrections to propose more prac
tical methods and a more attainable goal.
IX. ;
In Italy the reorganization effected by
the congress of Vienna was much more a

the French revolution and the conquests

many. In general the guiding principle
was the restoration of the princes who

desire of the Italians for union was

lows: If Austria could be provoked into
war without starting an insurrection, and
Napoleon could be shielded from the ap
pearance of aggression, be would join
hands with Sardinia to expel Austria from
Italy. In that event Piedmont (Sardinia*
should be enlarged by the annexation of
Lomhardy. Venecia and probably of Par
ma jind .Hoitena, with some of th^ papal
Ft.ites, to make a kingdom of alwut 1-.-
Ow.oOO population. The rest of the papal
territory except Rome and vicinity should
be added to Tuscany to form another Ital
ian kingdom. The kingdoms of Sardinia.
Tuscany and Naples. w!th the remnant or
the papal states (Rome- and adjoining dis
tricts), should constitute a confederation
under the real control of Victor Emman
uel and under the honorary presidency of
the Pope.
Cavour accepted this stngrular combina
tion, of the programmes of Oioberti and
Balbo. feeling assured that If the revolu
tion were once let loose it could not be
confined to such fantastic bounds. He
now labored Incessantly for war. Tart of
the verbal agreement was made a formal
treatyin ISoS). and the precipitate action
of Austria soon brought on the war.
In less than two months Napoleon,
frightened at an uprising in Central Italy
which betokened union with Sardinia and
the consequent failure of a part of his*
plan, put on the brakes and made peace
with Austria on the basis of her retain
ing Venetla and yielding Lombardy to
Sardinia and the restoration of the princes
in Central Italy. The last provision was
impracticable without a renewal of the
war, and the following year saw the cen
tral provinces annexed to the kingdom of
Sardinia, which now became the kingdom
of Italy. The new kingdom comprised all
the peninsula except Venetia. the two Sl
oilles and the remaining papal states. In
IS61 the annexation or the two Sicilies
was effected and in two years the number
of Victor Emmanuel's subjects had in
creased to 23.000.<XM.> Instead of the 12.000,
000 contemplated by Napoleon III. Only
Venice and Rome remained outside, the
first under the hand of Austria and Rome
under the Pope.
Less fortunate than his grreat contem
porary, Cavour did not live to see his
work completed, but he died in the con
fidence that "Italy is made." An alliance
with Prussia In the spring of lSfi6 secured
Venetla to Italy when Austria was
brought to her knees that summer, and
four years later, when Napoleon fell,
Rome was occupied.
The union of Italy was now completo
and Rome became the capital. But It
brought with it political problems which
have not yet been solved. Unification had
come too quickly to make the Italian peo
ple one. Centuries of separate political
life, differences In temperament and edu
cation and considerable divergencies of
race and language have mads the real na
tionalization of Italy a slow process, so
slow, in fact, that a recent writerâ W. J.
Stillman, for many years a resident of
Italyâ records his conviction that a final
and real union of Italy would have been
more surely attained by the formation of
a confederation under favorable condi
tions than by the rushing together of un
like elements In the enthusiasm of revolu-

WASHINGTON. Dec. J3.â To-day'd state
ment cf the Treasury balances In the general
New York Stcck Market.
NEW TOHK. Dec 13.â The etock market to
*ay was less under the influence of the
Rrengtb of Individual stocks and mere under
the coming exigencies of the money market.
Even the eeriFStior.aJ and buoyant rise in the
Erie etocks !n the last half hour hardly served
t<< more than check the liquidation which was
In active force in the general market. Twenty
tifeht years Is given as the elapsed period
ftnee an idrie Company stock sold as high as
E0 on the Ftock Bxchange. To-day the first
preferred sold et 12\ in the late dealings. Ex
trune advances for to-<!ay In the company's
ttccks were, for the common 3*Â«, for the first
r^efcrred 4"Â» and for the second preferred
E%. The authoritative announcement that a
contract of sale had been signed between the
2Vnnf>*lvanta Coal Comjiany and a syndicate
fcÂ«t;ded by the central r>ower in the anthracite
trade was the cause of the buoyancy. The
rTTtcx on the other anthracite stocks, however,
was Vfry Err.all. Some firmness was manifest
in the South western railways on buying teem^
!:c'.y in the interest t>Â£ the bull pool, notably
tl.e W abash securities. Otherwise selling was
Â«rÂ«Â»iieral throughout the lli>t and tboee stocks
which have persisted in their upward move
ment this week were as a rule the weakest.
TT.is v.as noticeably true of the Fteel group,
in which the declines ran- up to 2 points or
oicr. Sugar and the New York public utill
tiÂ«Â« fell Irom about 2 iÂ«>!ntÂ« to 2'i. Consoli
dated Gas and a number cf other prominent
ftucks. both in. the railroad and industrial list,
lell frcra 1 to 1%.
The tionds of the Erie Company and some
of the BouthwMtÂ»ra railroads were In demand

New York Metal Market.
NEW TORK, Dec. 13.â The most notable
factor In the local metal markets was the new
records for this year of lead and spelter made
at London, where lead closed very weak at Â£16
2s 6d, while the local market remained dull
and nominally unchanged on the basis of
$4 37%; spelter at London closed weak at Â£1S
12s 6d; this had a weakening Influence on our
market, which sold off 2H points to |4 13.^4 20
and was very weak at the decline. Tin was
rather unsettled, with trading confined chiefly
to supplying Immediate requirements. Prices,
however, show a gain of about 50 points over
last night's close to $M 75 in sympathy with
similar advance at London, where tho market
closed firm at arise of Â£1 10s to Â£117 10s. Copper
ruled quiet and nominally quoted at $17 for
Lake Superior and $16 62ty for electrolytic and
casting. In London copper was 2s 6d lower at
Â£71 2s 6d. Trading in tho domestic iron mar
kets was of a hand to mouth character and tho
undertone at nominally unchanged prices.
English markets for Iron were weak and un
settled. Glasgow at the close was quoted at
60s 4d and Middleboro D3s 6d nominally.

CHICAGO. Dec. 13.â In the wheat pit con
siderable stuff recently acquired was turned
adrift on a moderately activo market May
opened unchanged at 73%@74c, being for tho
moment supported by the steadiness of the
Liverpool and Antwerp markets and vague
rumors of export business done yesterday.
Thereafter the tendency was downward. Re
ct-Ipts were liberal and holders feared the- usual
bfarlshnesa of the Government report due
Monday. A prosprct that the Southwest stocks
for the week would phow an increase of 1,200.
000 bushels was not encouraging. May during
the- forenoon dropped to 73Vj&73%e. steadied
for a while and then continued the decline to
73VÂ»c. The close was weak. May HSHc lower
at 73}Â»c.
Corn was quiet and prices were depressed
bv freer country offerings and excellent
weather. May closed %c lower at S554@S5TbC
December closed hie down.
Oats were quiet. May closed a BbjuJe lower
at 23*; c
Provisions were dull but firm because hog
receipts were under the estimate. Shorts bid
for lard early, but none was offered. January
pork closed 10c higher, lard 2%c up and ribs
a shade Improved.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

WHEATâ New York and Paris were both
weak, the former declining %c. Liverpool, on
the contrary, was slightly higher. There was
a better cash inquiry in all markets, with bet
ter prospects for reducing stocks. The demand
for Flour was also improving.
Chicago opened tame, but with little pressure
to sell. There was some scattered outside buy
â¢ing, and the feeling seemed healthier. The
long Wheat has apparently passed Into strong
hands, and Is not for Bale. Later on in the
session Armour did some selling, others fol
lowed, and prices fell off somewhat. New York
wired small acceptances. The Southwest, on
the contrary, commenced to buy.
This market was a fraction higher on the
spot, with futures about as before.

You will find her story of
"Jack Redmond's Christmas"

than most writers can give in
a whole novel. You will want

paper in the United States can
rival the Christmas Call in the

FORD ASKS TIME
IN RATE CASE
Railroad Commissioners All
at Sea on Santa Fe's
Vexed Question.
The State Board of Railroad Commis
sioners grappled Â¦with the perplexing
case of the Los Angeles Traffic Associa
tion against the Santa Fe Company a
greater part of yesterday and when the
board adjourned it was as far from a. set
tlement as when the case was first taken
up. Attorney General Ford had been
asked to render an opinion as to why the
Railroad Commissioners should not pro
ceed to adjust passenger rates over the
Santa Fe lines, but Mr. Ford sent In a
request that he be given more time to re
view the evidence in the case. "I do not
want to jeopardize the interests of the
people in the Fresno rate case now await
ing decision In the Supreme Court," Mr.
Ford says, and he adcPs, "nothing of
greater importance to the State of Cali
fornia in relation to the great problem
of transportation has ever been the sub
ject of Judicial investigation than tha
questions arising out of this case. In
fact, the very life of your body is at
stake and the power of the people through
constitutional and legislative machinery
to control the common carriers of Cali
fornia Is at Issue."
In accordance with Mr. Ford"s request
action In the case was postponed until
an opinion can be prepared.

â¢ After speaking of the outrages to

concluded with the following remarks rel
ative to the strike question:
The conflict in every gtrlk* is to settle thÂ»

tacitly so understood by the court. In
stead the attorneys pressed for a heaxins
and the court refused Levlnsky*s motion.
He then demanded that the case be heard
by another Judge, asserting 1 that Jones
was not in a frame of mind to g\x9 his
client, Mary Mann, an unbiased hearing:.
This moved the court to tears yesterday,
but he stayed with, his opinions.
When the case was called to-day, tha
court asked. "Where iÂ» Mr. Levtnsky?"
"He is In San Francisco before the Su
preme Court asking- for a writ of prohibi
tion to prevent this court trying this
case," answered Mr. Beardslee of the
firm. He then turned and left tha court
room. "Proceed with the caaa," ordered
Judge Jonea. Attorney Thompson re
marked that neither Mary Mann nor any
one representing her was In court.
Judge Jones ordered the bailiff to jro out
into the corridor and shout twice for the
firm of "Woods, Levinnlcy & B#ard>lee;
twice for Mr. "Woods, twice for Mr. Le
vlnsky and twice for Mr. Beardslee. Aft
er the shouting, to which there was no
response. Attorney Thompson made a mo
tion for a nonsuit, which -was granted.
Beardslee then telephoned Levlnsky at
the Supreme Court room In San Francis
co, and the latter, learning of the court's
order, did not press his petition for thÂ«Â»
writ. He returned this evening: and an
nounced that he will promptly try to
show the court Its error, but he had a pe
culiar twinkle In his eye suggestive of a
lively time when he appears before tha
court to make a motion for a. rehearing.

and one of the leading Catholic
educators of th* coaft, is lying se
riously ill at St. Mary's College in this
<*ity. He is suffering from Bright's dis
ease and heart trouble, nnd all hope of his
recovery has been abandoned.
Brother Lasrian Is known all over the
<x>ast. from Vancouver to the Mexican
!ine, for he has been connected with Cath
olic rchoois In many cities on this coast.
The greater part of his life has been piven
to St. Mary's Collece durinR its existence
in Fan Francisco and Inter durinsr its ex
istence in Oakland. He is known as a most
successful Instructor, a careful manager
and one who Inspired the confidence and
respect of the boys under his control. As
n manager .->f students he earned a special
reputation. He always took a preat in
terest In their life outside of thÂ«>ir studies,
particularly in their r.thletic life, and this
harry faculty, coupled with his learnlnp.
made him a preat favorite with his schol
ar*. Many successful business and pro

in life to Brother Lascian.
Brother I^ascian is a native of Ireland, j

Thirty \ears of Brother Lascian's life
j have iieen privon to the work of the Chris

i has horn on this coast. He was an in
; stru^tor in the Sacred Heart College in
, San F"ranoiÂ«co from 1S7S to 1S83. In the
| latter year he removed to Oakland and
| became the director of St. Joseph's Acad

' school in charge of the Christian Broth
ers on this side of the bav. He remained
; with St. Joseph's Academy until 18S9.

' IW he returned to St. Mary's College In
'Â¦ Oakland as prefect of studies. He re-
I mained with St. Mary's until last spring.
j when he opened a school In Santa Cruz.
I His health lieeran to fall and his duties at
Santa Clara were too arduous, so he was
I transferred to Vancouver as director of
St. James College in that city. He re

this city, feeling that his end was near

those with whom he had spent the best
years of his life. His failure was rapid,
and it was not expected that he would live
through last night. Death may come at
any time.
SOME OF THE REASONS WHY
MARK THALL HAS TROUBLES
AND IS SAD.
BROTHER LASCIAN. HE IS KNOWN ALT, OVER THE PACIFIC COAST
FOR HIS WORK. IN THE CAUSE OF EDUCATION, AND NOW LIES
ON HIS DEATHBED.
FRIENDS of Mark Thall of the Al
cazar may have noticed recently
that he has a preoccupied, dis
turbed, distressed" look in his
eyes. He starts nervously at in
terrupting voices and it is not unlikely
that if one were to whisper "pawnbroker"
in his ear he would be driven into a fit.
Mark has troubles. Some time ago one
of his friends, Louis Jenness, came to
him with a story â one of the hard luck
variety which is never told to a police
man.
Jenncss had been the happy possessor of
a superb diamond, the gift of a very dear
friend. He prized his spark not alone tor
its intrinsic value, but for the associa
tions which gleamed in its many tires.
But the spark had to go and one day it
cast reflected regrets from the shew win
dow of a Market-street pawnbroker. It
was earning $4 a month for its new custo
dian.
Jenness thought long and earnestly and
finally asked T..all to redeem the diamond
and keep it until the Jenness treasury was
able to bring it back to the Jenness lin
ger. Mark was kind. He redeemed the
diamond an! without inspecting it placed
it in one of the slrorg b?xes of the Al
cazar safo. Tim*- passed anil the Jenness
treasury iang j.siv.ri. but yesterday '1 hall
was ask-Hi ... g.v* tack the diamond.
Jenness rad found a purchaser. Tnall
dived deep into the strong box and fished
out the spark. Smilingly he handed it to
Jenness. The latter looked at it and
gasped: "That's not my spark.* The
pawnbroker has substituted a bogus dia
mond."
Then there was war. Thall and Jenness
and the prospective purchaser swooped
down on the pawnbroker. Everybody
talked at once and nobody got satisfaction.
Everybody called everybody else names
and thu argument is still in progress. And
that is why Mark Thall is sad. He
swears that all the friends in creation
won't persuade him again to become cus
todian for the best spark in the world.

YOUNG PHYSICIANS
RECEIVE DEGREES
BISHOP J. W. HAMILTON of- the
Methodist denomination deliv
ered a masterly lecture on "The
Achievements of the Closing
Century" at the Central Meth
odist Church last night. The lecture con
sisted of a scholarly review of the frreat
reform movements which have marked
the century; notably *the woman's rights
agitation and the emancipation of slaves.
Dr. Hamilton in speaking of strikes spoke
of the .church's mission in reconciling
poor to rich and advocated Christian so
cialism as a remedy for much that has
puzzled sociological students. The lec
turer quoted Thoreau as saying that time
was a river in which men fished, and from
this figure drew an inference that in the
ocean of the centuries only the larger in
habitants were captured. Continuing, he
spoke In part as follows:
Centuries fee<l on great events and reject the
small ones. Small things are forgotten la
treat ones, and we sum up a hundred y?ars
to single out the great events which are to
be remembered. It is more the achievements
â¢which are of the mind and the heart which
are to be marked in the course of a hundred
years. We are to see preshadoired In the be
ginning of the century the great rush of events
â¢which is to signalize the end. At the ban
ning of the century one throb of human im
pulse brought together in cur country a move
rr.tnt that threw the Jew Into contact with the
Greek, which brought all Christians together
iiuder one form of creed and formed a founda
tion for a great structure of reform.
Beginning with the Missouri compromise
came the second chapter nt the century, which
Â¦was to witness one of the greatest humanitar
ian movements in the history of the world, the
emancipation of the slave, a movement which
was to occupy the energies of the greatest and
brst minds of the century, and this brings us
to the statesmen who etand out in a hui>dred
years of history.
Of statesmen, a man most distinguished of
them allâ godlikeâ is Daniel Webster. Cal
lioun. Clay and Henry are three added names
which make up the great American four.
In Seneca Falls in IMS was born a humble
movement, which rose from the sneering title
of "feminine fad" to the proud condition of a
Fenate-swaylng question. I refer to the eman
cipation of women. It permeated all our re-
I'.pious as well as political thought. But -you
reed not go back fifty years to realize that
there are to-day many women who have not
realized the New Testament revelation con
cerning women.
You no more thought of a woman lawyer
twenty years ago than you did of a woman
Iliysician. As for a woman preacher. thÂ»
thins was foreign to our thought. We thought
that if Ood was to let a woman preach the
vhole machinery would go to ruin.
I want to say that from 1850 to 1S75 there was
accomplished a revolution which gave an en-

latest Venture.
B. Campbell, traffic manager of the
Oregon Railway and Navigation Com
pany, is in the city and at the Palace
for a few days. Mr. Campbell Is on his
way to New Orleans, where he will make
arrangements for the handling of cotton
on through bills of lading from New Or
leans via Portland and the Oregon Com
pany's own line of steamers to the Ori
ent.
It Is proposed to establish an office in
New Orleans and from there send travel
ing agents through the cotton country to
secure the business, which Mr. Campbeil
thinks will be large In volume. It was
only a short time ago that the shipment
of cotton to Japan ar.d China from New
Orleans began, but the growth of the traf
fic has been phenomenal and recently a
large number of Japanese buyers ai*
rar.ged for largely Increased supplies.
Mr. Campbell is in close touch with the
Oriental trade and he says a wonderful
activity will develop Just as soon as the
present Chinese troubles have been set
tled. He expects to be ready to handle
large cotton shipments from New Or
leans through the Portland terminal
within ninety days.

CAPTAIN MARTIN R. ROBERTS,
one of San Francisco's oldest citi
zens, passed peacefully away last
night at his residence at 904
. Washington street. His death
was due to old age.
Captain Roberts was born in Dart
mouth, England, eighty years ago. , He
came to this country when quite young
and located in New York. At the age of
27 he was ranked as captain in the mari
time service, and at the outbreak of the
Mexican War was given command of a
transport. His splendid record as a ma
riner was the cause of his coming to this
coast, as he was offered the command of
the fleet of vessels which were to run be
tween the Columbia River and San Fran
cisco. He arrived here in April, 1849, but
the proposed line was a failure owing to
a scarcity of sailors. Captain Roberts re
mained on the coast, taking part in the
stirring times of the golden days. He
was a member of the Vigilance Commit
tee, was foreman of Vigilant No. 9, Vol
unteer Firemen, and took an active part
in the formation of the Exempt Fire Com
pany.
In '1859 Captain Roberts was elected Su
pervisor, -and became noted for his advo
cacy of movements toward reform. He
finally became located on the water front,
managing the affairs of different shipping
concerns. Standing as a monument to his
Ingenuity and study is Â¦ the present sys
tem of handling coal, which was invented
by him.
The deceased leaves . three children-
Theodore Roberts,, the actor, now .with
the "Arizona" Company at the Herald
Square Theater; M. R. Roberts Jr. and
Mrs. Grace R. Moore, secretary of the
California Club. He was the uncle of
Lawyer's Clerk in Trouble,
A. J.' McPike, a lawyer's clerk, appeared
before Judge Cabanlsa yesterday on a
charge of battery and the case was con
tinued until to-day. He was arrested at
1 o'clock yesterday morning and he is still
ln the City Prison, as. orders were given
not to release him on ball. McPike and
a friend were drinking in Goeppert's sa
loon, 120 Stockton street. Jacob Lichtner.
an old man and a crippie, who is the head
waiter ln . the - place, wanted to close-up
the saloon and tried to Induce McPike'a
friend, who lives in the neighborhood to
go home. McPike interfered and struck
Lichtner a blow . between the eyes that
felled the old man like an ox. He struck
the sidewalk with his fOTehead, which
was cut open. McPike was arrested bv
Policeman Fennell and Lichtner was sert
to the Receiving Hospital and afterward
to his home at 1208 Howard street It
was reported that hi3 skull was po<wlblv'
fractured and that i* why'McPifa waV
not released on ball. Â«-*"Â«Â» was
Florence Roberts, the actress, who played
so successfully the part of Sapho at the
Alcazar a short time ago.
DEATH CLAIMS ONE OF THE VETERANS
OF THE SEAS AND SKILLED INVENTOR
as Pioneer and Seaman in Two Countries.
Martin Roberts Gathered to His Fathers After Varied Career
A great surprise was sprung yesterday
in the trial of Hoff. Schooler, for the de
fense, opened the case early in the morn
ing. After he had called seven witnesses
to the stand he rested his side of the case.
This was a most unexpected move, as it
was believed the defense would at least
call as many witnesses as were sum
moned by it in the former trial, and that
Hoff would go on the witness stand and
testify ln his own behalf. In the former
trial Hoff did not make a very favorable
impression on account of his snappy and
jaunty manners. Schooler stated yester
day that he did not call Hoff ln this trial
as he "did not think it was necessary/'
but it is believed that Schooler did not
want to have a repetition of Hoff'e con
duct.
The seven witnesses called for the de
fense were mostly women who had era
ployed Hoff at different times, and who
testified that they had never seen the de
fendant use a coupling pin.
The first witness was John Freres, who
is the proprietor of a grocery store on
Seventh and Minna streets. He swore
that he was at one time friendly with
Hoff, and that when he went out the de
fendant ofteji looked after his store and
acted as protector of his wife in his ab
sence. Mrs. Silverberg, living at 9S9 Post
street, and her son John both testified
that Hoff had worked at their house, and
neither of the witnesses had ever
seen him use a coupling pin in his work.
Mrs. Ida M. Hollis and Mrs. C. A. Kern
gave substantially the same testimony.
Harry Neemeyer, the clerk of the Llndell
House, was recalled, and testified that
Hoff did not change his clothes when he
went to his room on the evening of De
cember 15, 1S37. As Robert Goepel, -the
shoemaker friend of Hoff, had committed
euiclde since the last trial, a transcript
of his testimony was introduced. The at
torneys on both sides agreed that the
coupling pin weighed five pounds and
Hoff's carpet bag, when filled with tools,
eighteen pounds. *
In the afternoon Attorney Hosmer made
the opening argument for the people, pre
senting a statement of facts.
To-day Attorney R. LÂ». Simpson will ar
gue for the defense. He will be followed
by his associate ln the case, W. H. (Schoo
ler. Eugene Deuprey will close tire case
for the prosecution.
Hoffs Attorneys Claim That
His Testimony Is Not
Necessary.
WILL MOT TAKE
WITNESS STAND
PÂ»i p~a HE report of a pistol shot down on
I Merchant street. Just opposite the
1 1 Central police station, early last
II evening told of the carrying out of
a suicide which will go on record
as one of the strange instances of self
murder.
A minute or two after 6 o'clock last
night a well-dresed, respectable appearing
man, whom Investigation proved to be
B. B. Roberts, a general agent and so
licitor, sauntered leisurely down Merchant
street, and accosting a habitue of one^of
the many saloons in that neighborhood
inquired the location of the Morgue. He
was shown the door of the deadhouse,
and his informant added that to gain ac
cess to it he would have to apply at the
Coroner's office. Just above. Turning up
the street Roberts entered the stairway of
the court building, where the office is lo
cated. A few seconds later a shot at
tracted the deputy coroners on the floor
above to the spot.
On the stairs Just above the landing was
Edward A. Palmer, a young English
man, who arrived in the city yesterday
morning to enioll himself at Stanford
University, fell into the hands of bunko
men, and if it had not been for the quick
wit displayed by I. J. Truman, president
of the Columbian Bank, he would have
lost $500 besides the $130 he actually lost.
Palmer was met at the ferry by a well
dressed young man who struck up an ac
quaintance with him. The stranger had
learned by some means known to bunko
men that Palmer Intended going to Seat
tle last night to stay until the holiday
season was over, and he Informed Palmer
that he was also going to Seattle. The
stranger was Charles Stinson. who was
one of those arrested for playing faro ln
the Burlington House recently and for
steering Marc Augenblick, the. Market
street saloon-keeper, to the game, in
which he lost $CO0.
Stinson accompanied Palmer to the Pal
ace Hotel, and after he had registered
went with him to the railroad ticket of
llce to reserve his berth for Seattle. Then
Stinson suggested that Palmer should ac
company him to his doctor, as he was
not in the best of health and he wanted
to consult him before leaving on the train.
Palmer went with him and he was
steered to a house on Post street, he
thought where he was introduced to
"Dr." * ranklln and Mr. Stearns. Stinson
and the "Dr." talked aside for a few min
utes and a game of poker was proposed.
Palmer demurred at first, but Stinson
talked him over, and he sat down to the
table, which was stacked with "phony"
rolls of greenbacks and stacks of bogus
"twenties." supposed to be those handed
over by Chief Sullivan to the faro men
Wednesday. Palmer won at first, but
poon lost $130. He had a letter of credit
on the Columbian Bank for $300, and Stln-
Hon advised him to cash It, as he told him
he held the winning hand and would
gather ln a fortune of $600,000. Palmer left
his hand on the table, asking the "Dr."
to look after It. and went with Stinson to
the bank.
President Truman happened to be in the
bank, and when the letter of credit was
handed to him he became suspicious. He
privately asked Palmer a few questions
and telephoned to Captain Seymour to
send a detective at once to the bank. De
tective McMahon and Policeman Fontana
were detailed and they placed Stinson un
der arrest. He had been detained pending
their arrival. SUnson was taken to the
City Prison, where a charge of grand lar
ceny was booked against him. He gave
the name of Charles Station.
Detective McMahon went with Palmer
to see if he could recognize the house
where Stinson took him, in the hope that
the other two men might be caught. Stin
son when questioned gave the address as
37 Post street.
A visit to the premises resulted in the
arrest of G. H. Lawrence, otherwise
known as "Dandy Dan," who was recog
nized by Palmer as one of the men with
whom he. played. He was charged with
grand larceny.
Late last evening both were were re
leased on $250 bail each.
Falls Into the Hands of
a Gang of Clever
"Sharks."
the lifeless body of Roberts, a gaping
wound through the head telling the story.
In the right hand was clutched a bulldog
revolver and between the fingers of the
pther was a partly consumed cigar. Rob
erts had seated himself ln a natural pos
ture, his right side resting against the
wall and banister. His glasses were still
on his nose, and hia inner coat was but
toned. the position of the body showing
that Roberts had carried the pistol ln his
overcoat pocket.
A physician was sent for and on hia pro
nouncing- the man dead the body was
carried next door to the Morgue.
From letters found ln his pockets It was
learned that Roberts had been employed
for many years and until quite recently
by the Johnson Locke Mercantile Com
pany as a freight solicitor. A short time
ago Roberts opened a general agency of
fice at 219 Sansome street.
Roberts was vice president of the Old
Friends Association and was known
among: his associates as a pleasant, agree
able man, good natured and liberal.
Among his effects were several letters of
recommendation ln which Roberts was
spoken of as a first class solicitor. One
from his last employers explained that he
had quit the firm only because It had
given up the line of work ln which Rob
erts had served them faithfully, and de
clared that he was the most energretlc
and successful solicitor employed by
them.
Roberts lived with his wife at 668 Fol
som street. Some time ago he had a
severe attack of typhoid fever and 111 ef
fects have resulted. It is believed that
Roberts killed himself while laboring
under mental disorder brought about by
this.
Deceased was a native of England and
about 50 years of age.
