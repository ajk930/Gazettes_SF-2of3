about sixty persons gathered to witness
it. Like all other executions at the prison,
machine-like procedure marked its every
stage. Without a hitch the affair . was
brought to a close. Sullivan's body shot
through the' trap before many . of .the
spectators had seen him. In. fifty-three
seconds from the time Sulllvaji left his

broken.
The strain of the last few days told
heavily on Sullivan, and he wasted away
considerably. At most he never. had but
faint hope3 that the Governor would In
terefcre. and last night when no reprieve
arrived his last hope was gone. Sullivan
proclaimed his Innocence of the crime for
whieh he was executed. He declared he
was the victim of reward hunters who
wanted the $1500 offered for a conviction.
The man who killed Gillard, he said,
subsequently committed suicide. Almost
his last words as he left the condemned
cell on tho inarch to the gallows were
those declaring his Innocence.

DENVER. Nov. 16.â When asked his

negro assailant and murderer, Preston

DENIES RESPONSIBILITY
When Sheriff Freeman was overpowered
after a little parley, e. rope was thrown
around Porter's neck. T He made not the
least resistance as he was carried bodily
out of the car. Clinging only to his Bible,
he was led by the neck, literally like a
lamb led to theslauchter. * ,
"I guess so," said the Sheriff. Then,
as the train pulled into Llmon and no
one was in sight on the platform. Porter's
face lighted up for a moment. The com
mittee of sixteen hiding behind the sta
.tion sprang out over the platform and
Porter's face fell. He had thought for a
moment that he was safe. The train was
already moving on to Lake Station by
the time the sixteen had battered In the
door of the rear coach. Porter fixed his
eyes on the Bible before him and did not
release them nor betray any motion when
the door was .burst in and the lyncheri
swarmed about him.
"Do you think you can keep them off'"
he asked, with a glance at the Sheriff's
revolver.
"They'll get me at Llmon and that will
be the last of this poor nigger," replied
Porter. He was trembling and a sickly
yellow. He opened the Bible which he
had held in his hand all along and pre
tended to read. Presently he seemed to
regain his composure and lapsed Into ab
solute silence, speaking only when he was
spoken to and then briefly. He repeated
his confession of guilt with perfect calm
ness. Just before the â¢ train pulled Into
Llmon, the rear door locked and Por
ter looked up at Sheriff Freeman.
. "I guess you know you are going now?"
said Captain Armstrong, answering a
question Porter had asked on the way.
"We are going to take you to Hugo jail."
- The murderer and avenger rode to this
execution In the same train, but In dif
ferent cars. Porter was taken Into Â»tho
rear coach and placed in a seat about the
center alongside Sheriff Freeman, who

Freeman was to board the train alone in
Denver so as to throw any mob that
might form in Denver off the scÂ«nt.
Porter was not at all afraid when he was
preparing for the trip, but when he satv
the buggy and the officers he. suspected
where he was going, and. flinching, he
hung back. Sheriff Jcnes half dragged
him to the carriage. The ride to Mag

LOUISE FROST'S FATHER
DECIDES UPON BURNING
Suggestions of Mutilation Are Hot
Heeded â¢ by the Parent of
the Murdered Child,
The train bearing the negro, in custody
of Sheriff Freeman and his deputies, from
Denver arrived in Llmon at 3:45 p. m. It
was at first announced that the negro was
to be executed by hanging. Many, includ
ing the father of the negro's victim, pro
tested that such a death would be too
easy, and It was finally decided to leave
the method of death to the outraged
father. He decided upon burning at the
stake. About three miles from Llmon,
and near the scene of the negro's crime,
the whole party left the train and began
preparations for the deed of vengeance.
Suggestions of mutilation before burn
ing were made, but Mr. Frost declared
against It.
Wagons were dispatched for wood and
upon their return a score of men assisted
in preparing It for the fire. ' When at last
preparations were completed a further
delay was made, because it was known
many were en route from Hugo and other
parts of the county to take , part in the
affair. It had been annuonced that 5:30
would be the hour for starting the fire,
but it was nearly an hour later when the
word was finally given.
A strange feature of the affair was that
of souvenirs. The negro had since his
confession been devoting e\*ery moment of
daylight to the perusal of a Bible given
him by the Denver Jailer. Even while
waiting for his execution he sat by a bon
fire reading from the Gospel of St. Luke.
Just be fore he was tied to the stake, upon
request for souvenirs, the boy tore the
leaves from the Bible and distributed
them among his executioners.

fleets at Manila and Santiago were destroyed and Spain was threatened at home the military problem, to every well-instruct
ed military mind, was solvedâ decided. It was more desirable for us to make war at Santiago than at Havana, if the Span
iards wished It so. because it was not as well defended as the capital. If Blanco had moved against Santiago an expedition
would immediately have been sent against Havana. As it was, when the capitulation of Santiago took place, it was found
that more Spanish soldiers had surrendered than comprised our army. The course of events as well as' the military situ
ation decided the contest against them, and one of the prominent causes of the loss of Cuba was the conduct of General
LOSS OF CUBA DUE TO BUTCHER WEYLER'S CONDUCT.
LONDON, Nov. 16.â A Breslau. special
says: Emperor William was the object of
an attempted"dutrage to-day, which, how
ever, failed. As he was driving in an open
carriage to the cuirassier barracks, ac
companied by the hereditary Prince of
Saxe-Meinlngen, a woman in the crowd
hurled a short hand chopper or hatchet at
the carriage. The hatchet struck the car
riage, but the rapidity with which the
vehicle waa passing saved Its occupants.
The woman was immediately, arrested.
She is believed to be insane. The
woman's name is Selma Schnapke. : She
occupied a place in the front rank of the
spectators, on the side of. the. Emperor.
A crowd of people who witnessed the out
rage threw themselves on his Majesty's
assailant, but the prompt intervention of
the police saved the woman from Injury.
The assailant is a tradeswoman of Bres
lau. A provisional medical examination of
the prisoner was had and she has been
pronounced insane. While the Emperor
was returning from the barracks to the
railroad station he was cheered by an im
mense cro.wd of people who were gath
ered along the route.
According to most reports, Emperor
William did not notice the incident, but
the Breslau Scleschle Morgen Zeitung
says he saw what had happened and
turned very pale, but continued to greet
the bystanders pleasantly. According to
a special to the Lokal Anzeiger, his
Majesty was "apparently in a serious
mood after the incident."
â¢The entire Breslau garrison was Im
mediately alarmed and 'drawn tip in line
on both sides of the route which the Em
peror took in returning from the barracks
to the depot after luncheon.
The news of the attempt on the Kaiser
made a great sensation In Berlin. It waa
first reported on the Boerse, where the
market weakened.
While the "attack upon the Kaiser may
not have formed any part of an inter
national plot, there Is no doUbt that un
usual anarchist activity is developing in
various countries of Europe and that the
police are taking exceptional precautions
against It. The entire line of railway
from Budapest to Goeboelloo, where is
situated the palace of Emperor Francis
Joseph, is guarded by special police, a
thing which wtfS never done before. Otto
Albrecht, editor of Neues Lenien, an an
archist paper published in Berlin, was ar
rested to-day in the suburbs ofAlder"

Rosebery Sees Trouble Ahead. ." -
A special from Glasgow says: The Earl
of Rosebery was installed, as I.ord P~-
tor of Glasgow University to-day. His
rectorial address on the subject ot '"'ino
British Empire" was a stirring appeal to
the race to realize Its responsibilities and
to. prepare to fight for its . existence
Never, said his lordship, did the empire
so urgently require the â¢ strenuous sup
port of Its subjects, because there was
a disposition abroad to challenge both
Its naval and Its commercial supremacy
The twentieth century, â¢ he declared',
would be a period of keen, intelligent and
almost .fierce international competition
more probably in the arts of peace even
than in the arts of war. Therefore he
added, it was necessary to undertake peri
odical stock-taking, to remodel the state
machinery and educational methods and
to become more business-like and
thorough as warriors, merchants and
statesmen and to look thoroughly to the
training of first-rate men for the struggle
ahead, as on* these depended the future of
the empire and the race. He thought -the
now antiquated methods of training had
almost resulted In Â» commercial disaster
and the time had arrived to reconsider the
educational apparatus. â¢ .

saying they were glad to get back. They
were all clad comfortably in winter cloth

for means. Their soft, broad-brimmed felt
hats were decorated with buttons and
other insignia of the soldiers. On their
arrival in. this city they were escorted
to the. Vanderbilt Hotel, where they were
entertained. The original number of the
corps who went to South Africa was flfty

taken prisoner, some are in the hospital
and some remain In South Africa. The
corps left South Africa for home about a
month and a half ago, going first to
Trieste, and from there to Paris. They
boarded the Trave at Cherbourg. John

â . y
QENERAL WILLIAM R. SHAFTER was not inclined
to take General Weyler's assertions seriously, when
shown the cablegram yesterday at the army head
quarters. He said that evidently Weyler was talking
for effect, as every military man knew that the Span
iards In Cuba, without the aid of a fleet to prevent the land-
Inp of invaders in any required number, could- not have held
the island against tho Americans. General Shafter said:
"I do not care to speak of General Weyler' s record in Cuba,
or whether or not he 'has received unjust censure. My in
formation on that question Is second hand, as Weyler . had
been gone and a more conciliatory policy on trial come months
before I reached Cuba. Of course we eaw everywhere the ef
fects of the Spanish occupancy, but I do not care to discuss the
responsibility for the conditions that existed.
"It Is very well known that the force of Spain In Cuba out
numbered by several times the force landed for the; reduction
of Santiago, but there were but few available to operate
against the American troops landed in .that part of the island;
they were in distant parts, and transportation facilities for
them were very poor. This Is shown by the fact, that the.10.OCK)
Spanish troops reported to be at Holguln, the 3400 at San- Luis
and the 7500 at Guanjanamo remained at these places from the
date of the landing of my army C3rps, June 21, 22 and 23, until
July 15, the day upon which the surrender was made, the city
being occupied on the morning of the 17th. . , .
"Had these troops promptly moved to the attack of- the
Fifth Army Corps the difficulties of the Americans would have
been greatly increased, but I do not think they could 'have
been driven Into the sea. It Is possible, however, that if these
21,000 troops had. co-operated with .the 3000 troops that did re
inforce the troops of Santiago on the night of July 2 in mak
ing a vigorous attack, they might have placed the American
.army 'on the' defensive for a few days, but the ultimate
capture' of,,. Santiago could only have been delayed. General
Linares'" telegrams to his Government as to the condition
of affairs dearly Indicate this. .- / . â¢; . ' i
"That the , fleet was necessary for the preservation- of
Spanish possession in Cuba was clearly' shown by the fact that
immediately after, its destruction and the surrender of 24,000
of the 150,000 soldiers then in Cuba, overtures for peace were
commenced, the island being then absolutely at the mercy
of the American army and navy.
"Results are more conclusive than" theories, and "what Gen
eral "Weyler might or might not have done "is a matter which
appears to me to be of very little interest at this time.
"I do not care to criticize the statements attributed to Gen
eral Weyler, as the war with Spain is over, and everything
connected with it 1b A matter of history. The successors of
General Wevler did not drive the American army into the
sea or inflict any very serious losses upon- them, or even de
lay .their advance. It may not be generally known, but it is
a fact that they did not capture a single prisoner from tho
American army.
PARIS. Nov. 16.â General Weyler has emerged from his
shen and fires some hot shot at Anglo-Saxons in gen
eral In an interview given to the Figaro's correspond
ent. He opened by saying that he once more protested
against the abominable reputation created for him by
be American and English journals for political purposes. He
xmtinu^d:
"When I was Governor General of Cuba and was defending
he sovereignty of Spain In that colony, the least of my acts
>f war was distorted by the prets of the English-speaking
nations. I never troubled myself about that, for I always
'.id only my duty as a soldier, tvithout lending oar to rumor
if what was going on outside my province.
"I have noted sines with sorrow that these lying stories,
these calumnies, have found an echo In Europe. It has re
quired the events of the Transvaal and the stories of the
real cruelties committed upon the Boers by Lord Roberts
end the English for European writers to acknowledge that I
never conducted myself in Cuba as the British have done In
South Africa. People are now beginning to do me Justice.
"The truth of the matter Is that I carried on the war In
Cuba with the rigor which war requires. You cannot run
tilts of courtesy and generosity with rebel and half-cUillzed
negroes like our revolting Cubans, who were accustomed to
massacre. In horrible fashion, the eoldiers they had captured.
"People Ehoul<3 have seen our poor Spanish soldiers, thoso
brave little^ soldiers of 19 and 29 years of age, fighting with
the Cubans, to understand the real horror of that war. People
would have to have seen the excesses of which the Cubans
Â¦were guilty In the treatment of tfcelr prisoners; to have seen
them torturing and putting them through a slow martyrdom
and mutilating their dead bodies, to understand the peculiar
character of that war.
"But never mind that. I did my fluty as a soldier and am
ready to Co It again. My best reply to my traducers Is the
" esteem anfl affection In which I am held by the whole Spanish
armyâ the marks of devotion which have always been lavished
upon me by my companions in arms, both those in Cuba and
those of the Peninsula."
Explaining his presence In the Liberal party. General Weyler
remarked that It was the result of recent events.
"If I had been able to gather a strong Conservative party
after the death of Canovas I should have prevented the loss
of Cuba. At the bead of the Spanish troops which were then
in the Island I should have driven the Americans into the
6ca. The hasty levies of Americans wculd never have been
able to cope with the Spaniards. I should never have asked
for & fleet to be sent to me. Mr resources down there (in
Cuba) were quite amDle.
"General Blanco made horrible mistakes. He concentrated
all his troops In Havana instead of adopting tactics which
would have permitted him to -devote his efforts to the points
threatened by the Americans. It would have been easy to
save Santiago by dispatching there reinforcements at an
earlier ttage and with greater rapidity."

Ross, In explaining the reason for his en
forced resignation, said:
My coolie Immigration speech was â¢ not my
only orrrp.Bo. Last A^rll I complied with an
Invitation from the Unitarian Church of Oak
land to lecture before it on "The Twelfth
Century City." I odclresjeri myself wholly to
questions of city srowth and city health and
tquchrl only Incidentally on the matter of pub-
Ilo utilities. I pointed out, however, the drift,
both her* and abroad, toward the municipal
ownership of water and gas works, 1 and pre
dicted that, as regards street railways, Ameri
can cities would â¢ probably pass through a
period of munlciral ownership and then re
vert to Rrlvate ownership under regulation.
In reply Mrs. Stanford wired the fol
lowing:.
"Professor Boss cannot have made
such a statement, as he knows there
is' no foundation for such an asser
tion."
As this eliminates from the case, as far
as Mrs. Stanforfl Is concerned, the ques
tion of outside influences, it leaves It
where Dr. Jordan put it, that Sirs. Stan
ford was firm in her belief that Professor
Ross has been teaching a doctrine that Is
false and not for the best Interests of the
university.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov. 16.â
For the present, at least, the last appears
to have been said of the controversy
created by the resignation of Professor
Ross. The student body and faculty are
unanimous In the opinion that no good
can "come from further agitation and
acrimonious debate. The best Interests
of the great Institution demand that the
subject be dropped and this probably will
be done. It is likely that resolutions of
confidence In Professor Ross will be
adopted and there the affair will rest.
In the present controversy a great deal
of Interest attaches' to what Stanford
Itself thinks of Its position In the edu
cational world, of Its relation to older unl
veisities and generally accepted methods
of Instruction. In this regard the best
which has been said on the subject Is In
a pamphlet entitled "Stanford University
and Thereabouts," a publication author
ized by the university and one which. In
the highest spirit, la favorable to Palo
Alto. In this little book, published four
years^Rgo, an effort Is made to locate
Stanford University In the educational
world and to describe the. hopes and fears
of its friends. Following Is an excerpt:
"On Its educational side, the university
has naturally made less popular Impres
sion. Yet it Is in Its break with tradition.
In the vigor and freshness of Its educa
tional methods, that it is at once an ob
ject of solicitude to conservative scholar
ship and an inspiration to educational
radicalism. Naturally, neither believers
nor doubters are able to give to the
course of affairs at Polo Alto quite the
serious weight of established things. On
the one hand, its friends regard. the cir
cumstances under which Its experiments
are being tried as altogether exceptional
and wait for the day of .trial. On the
other its fearful censors cannot bring
themselves to regard with perfect gravltv
the freaks of so youthful a faculty At
any rate, the university has been assured
a comparatively free field for develop
ment, and Its growth and progress cannot
fall to be watched with increasing in
terest." ., â¢ . â¢ . â¢ Â¦
In the light of what Is now happening
the foregoing words were prophetic. Mem
bers of the "youthful faculty" have cre
ated a storm and aroueed the Interest of
the nation. .
In the discussion over Professor Ross
the retired instructor has been accused of
having leaned too far to radicalism In his
theories Â¦ of social government. He is
charged by certain critics with having
been intemperate in his Ideas of civilized
government. It is also known, however,
that the late Senator Stanford also held
views of an extremely socialistic nature.
One of his pet theories was that co-oper
ation in society is of the greatest possible'
benefit, and in outlining the object and
Purpose of the great institution he found
ed he was particular to Insist that co
operation In society should be taught to
tho students.. He spoke as follows:
'The object and purpose of the uni
versity should be to qualify students for
personal success and direct usefulness in
life and to promote the public welfare by
exercising an Influence in behalf of hu
manity and civilization,, teaching the
blesPingR of liberty regulated by law and
Inculcating love and reverence for the
great principles of government as derived
from the inalienable rights of man to life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
, "It should be the aim of the institution
to entertain and Inculcate broad and gen
eral ideas of progress and of the capacity
if mankind for advancement In civiliza
tion. Wo have also provided that the
benefits resulting from co-operation shall
be freely taught. It Is through co-opera r
tion that modern progress has been most
pchleved. Co-operative societies bring
forth the best capacities, the best In
fluences of the Individual for the benefit
of the whole, while the good Influences
of the individual aid the many."
Labor Council on Professor Ross.
At -the regular weekly meeting of the
Labor Council last night the dismissal of
Professor .Robs from the Stanford Uni
versity was the principal theme of discus
sion.. The fact was brought to the atten
tion of the delegates that It was. at the
fiURjrestlon of the Labor, and Building
Trades councils of this v city ' that the
meeting In. Metropolitan Hall at which
Professor Ross spoke was called. A reso
lution which was prepared by Delegate
7,andt, condemning the dismissal of Pro
fessor Ross, was not adopted, as it failed
to express an opinion that Stanford Uni
versity Is a private not -a public Insti
tution.' The preparation of further reso
lutions was referred to the law and leg
islative committee, ; with, instructions to
report at the next, meeting.

ADVERTISEMENTS..
NEVEB TOO LATE'
To Try a Good Thing.
I am fifty-two years old. and fbr forty
years of that time I have been n chronic
catarrh sufferer, says Mr. James Gleshing
of Allegheny City: with every change of
weather my head and throat would be
stuffed up with catarrbal mucus.
I could not breathe naturally through
the nostrils for months together and much
of the time I suffered from catarrh of the
stomach. Finally my hearing began to
fall and I realized something must be
done. ' * â- -
I tried Inhalers and sprays at.d salve's
which gave me temporary relief, and my â¢
physician advised me to spray or douche
with Peroxide of Hydrogen. But the ca-
tarrh would speedily return In a few days,
and I became thoroughly discouraged.
I had always been prejudice'! against
patent medicines, but as everything elaa
had failed I felt justified in at least mak-
ing a trial. . - ,.,
Our good old family physician. Dr.
Ramsdoll. laughed at me a little, but said
if I was determined to try patent med*-
ctnes he would advise me to bÂ«gin with
Stuart's Catarrh. Tablets, because he
knew what they contained and he had
heard of several remarkable cun-s result-
ing from their use. and, furthermore, that
they were perfectly sare. containing no
cocaine or opiates.
The next day I bought a fifty-cent box
at a drug store, carried it in my pocket
and four or five times a day I would take
a tablet. In less than a week I felt a
marked improvement, which continued
until at this time I am entirely free from
any trace of catarrh.
My head is clear, .my throat free from
irritation, my hearing is as good as it
ever waa and I feel that I â¢ cannot say
enough in praise of Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets.

Southern Pacific Hotel at

The blaze started late this afternoon

miles and attracted the residents of all
the neighboring villages. /
The hotel was built by the Southern Pa

T*KIAH. Nov. 16.â In the case of the

city the full amount of damages demand
ed. The municipal corporation sued the
water company for damages fixed at
1570 75 for loss sustained by the city by
flre on *e night of July i6. 1899. When
the flre was flrst discovered there was.
no pressure of water in the water mains
and flre hydrants. It was found that the
agent, of the company had shut off the
water at the reservoir, " over half a mile,
distant, and there was much delay befors
a stream could be turned on.
When the prosecution concluded its tes
timony In chief yesterday Attorney Bled
soe. for the defense, moved for a non
sult on the ground that It had not been
proved that any contract existed by the
terms of which the water company was
obligated to supply water, under pressure,
for the extinguishing of fires. Mr. Bled
soe took the ground that the simple terms
of the franchise did not constitute a com
plete contract, but that a contract, to be
binding, must be in writing and .signed
by the proper officers of the respective
corporations. Attorney J. E. Pemberton
replied, taking the ground that the a-v
ceptance of the franchise by the com
pany and the collection of rates lixed by
the city made a binding contract.

ported that he was ''knifed" by ex-Queen
f.:i:uoka!ani. v. bo is said to have secretly
thrown her influence- to Wilcox. There Is
much bittTnefs against her among the
Domo'-rats. who Iiopcd that, even If they
r.A roi elect their man. they would at
ifast so divide the native vote that Wil
cox would bo rtchind Parker.
The independent native party liar car
ried rri<? House of Representatives by a
; nrge rr.ajrrlty. They will have fourteen
nf their men In the house, with nine Re
publican* and six men who are independ
ent and Democratic. In the Senate there
will be seven Republicans, eight Inde
pendÂ«?ntÂ« ! and one Democrat. With the
independents Ea control a lively session 1*
expected, as they are against the ruling
rÂ«-?ime and will give Governor Dole plenty
of opportunities for vetoes.
It is likely, as a result of the election,
that Congress will be asked to establish
(=otne limitation* upon the voting privilege.
The natives have won upon a race divi
sion, and now many of the whites want a
property qualification for voters. It is ar
eu*6 that In 'voting upon a simple color
line many of the natives have shown
themselves unfit for universal suffrage.
The returns, which are not* quite com
ri^te. shorn* Wilrox sixty-nine votes ahead.
The precincts to be heard from are ex
pected tn slightly increase this plurality.
Wilcox has S&2 votes. Parker 3563 and
Prince David 146$. Wilcox carried every
island but Oahu. where (Honolulu is. with
ts Jarge white population and with a ma-
Jority of the more educated natives. The
island of Kaual gave more votes to Wil
cox than to Parker and David combined.
The most encouraging feature to the
whites of both parties is In the fact that
the Wilcox majority is so small, which
shows that very many of the natives have
divided upon other than race lines. If all
the natives had cast Wilcox votes his
majority on each of the Islands* would
have been much larger than It is. Prob
ably a third of the native population wa3
aligned with the American parties, and It
Is thought that the future will rapidly in
crease the proportion.
The present prospect is that the Con
gressman-elect will be utterly Ignored by
the commercial and other Interests of the
Islands. It Is said that Samuel Parker
will go to Washington in any event, and
that, though he will have no official title,
he will look after Hawaiian Interests
there.
Al! the newspapers here deeply deplora
the election of Wilcox. The Star says
that the Chamber of Commerce should
send a man to Washington to look after
the Interests of Hawaii, declaring that th?
Territory cannot get the representation

the color line and It agrees as to the in
competency of Wileox to represent Hawaii
at the national capital, while ihe Buile
tin refers to the election of t-Â« Royalist
as a startling and deeply disappointing
fact.
Robert W. Wilcox Is very well known
to all people who are familiar with Ha
waiian history. He was a conspicuous
* characters In several revolutions, and has
Â»been a political worker since he was flrst
sent to the Legislature in 1SS0.
Wilcox was born on February 15, ISoj.
. at Honuaula. Maul. His father was
William S. Wilcox. a sea captain of New
port, R, I., and his motner a native
woman named Kalua. The father Is still
living on Maul and Is 85 years of age.
Robert Wilcox was educated at the Ha
leakala boarding school on Maul and
when 25 years old was elected -o the Leg
islature from Wailuku district.
The Congressman-elect was one of a
party sent by King Kalakaua to Italy t<Â»
study in the schools there. With Caesar
Celso Moreno. Hawaiian Minister of For
eign Affairs, Vho is now in Washington.
Wileox went to Turin, Italy, where he en
tered a military school. He remained
there till 1S87.
Wilcox was married In Italy to tho
Princess Victoria Colonna di Stlgllana.
daughter of Baron Lorenzo Sobrero. In
the latter part of 1SS7 he went to San
Francisco, where he was in the employ
of the Spring Valley Water Company, iu
the surveying department. In the spring
of 1SS9 he returned to Honolulu alone, hi*
wife going back to Italy.
In the revolution of July. 1SS9. when tho
new constitution under Kalaka.ua was pro
mulpated, Wilcox took a leadinr part and
he is also credited with having: been -a
leader In the abortive revolution, which
was for the purpose of placing Lllluoka
lani on the throne before the' death of
Kalakaua. A native jurv acquitted him
after the failure of this plot.
The national reform party 'sent WUcdx
to the Legislature from Palama In 1S90.
and he was elected again from. Koolauloa
In 1892. The- revolution of 1893 found him
acting with the royalist element.. After
the overthrow of the Queen he was In
command of the- natives that for a time
seemed likely to give battle to the revolu
tionists. They did not do so, however.
In the revolution of 1853. when an at
tempt was made to restore <*.ueen Lillu
okalanl, he was again a leader. This time
he was arrested and imprlsoneu for about
a year, after which he was pardoned' bv
President, now Governor, Dole.
Wilcox's second marriage was contract
ed soon after the last revolution. A decree
of divorce had been applied for In Italy
and it is claimed by Wilcox that he was
notified by the Italian Consul her* that
the decree had been Issued, before tho
second marriage took place. On the other
hand, it ha* been claimed by his enemies
that he was guilty of bigamy in contract
ing the second marriage, and this has
been made the basis of a statement that
he would be thrown out of Congress a3
was the Mormon Roberts.
The present Mrs. Wilcox was Theresa
Owana Kaohelelanl, descended from
Kemia. the father of King Kameha
meha the Great.

VICTORIA. B. C. Nov. 1G.â Telegraphic
advices from Dawson tell of a vote taken
there on November 6. coincident with the
American elections. Tho Dawson Nugget
conducted the affair. When the ballots
were counted it was found that the coun
try had pone pell-mell forjBryan. McKln
ley was snowed under by an even larger
avalanche than that which buried Bryan
in tne I'nlted States. There wore 3337
votes polled, and of these 2404 were for the
Democratic candidate and M3 for McKln
ley.
By the terms of the election Bryan will
get the Klondike souvenir, which is now
being prepared at a cost of more than $50-\
Tho souvenir will consist of nuggets hand
somely mounted and suitably engraved.
Tho Democrats celebrated after their
victory. They paraded the streets and
cheered for Uryan. Skaguay also went
for Bryan, and Juneau. too, declared for
the Democratic nominee. The Skaguay
Alaskan, in its comments on the Dawso-i
straw vote, notes the preponderance of
Americans in the northern district. , It
says:
Bogus Letter Traced to a Son of
The fact that the northern country is being
developed by Amrricana Is again shown in the
vote cast In the Nugget's Presidential contest
in Datvton. At that contest there were 3237
votes polled. . Only American citizens were
given the right of franchise. At the territo
rial election held on October 17 for members
of the Yukon Council, after a vigorous cam
paign, tn which every effort was made to bring
out a full^vote. there Wfrs less than 1500 votes
polled. At this election British only wers
permitted tiÂ» vote. Had there been the same
inducement to get out the full strength of
Americans It Is possible that the vote would
be 3 to 1 as compared with the flrst election.

PROBING THE LASSEN" FOEOEBY.
Democratic Nominee.
SUSANVILLE. Nov. 16.â Sensational de
velopments are promised as a result of
the Grand. Jury Investigation into the
despicable ' attempt to defeat . John B.
Irish, Republican nominee for the Assem
bly, by sending to voters a forged letter
purporting to come from the chairman of
the Lassen County Repuolican Central
Committpp, urging then* to vote agalnat
Irish because he had obtained the nom
ination by fraud.
The local attorney to whose office tho
letter was traced has testified before tha
Grand Jury that a son of J. M. Fritter,
the Democratic opponent of Irish, came
to his office with the original letter and
asked to have typewritten copies made.
Before consenting to have the work dqne
the attorney went to Mr. Fritter and
asked If there were any trickery In It,
saying that If Mr. Heines, the chairman
of the Republican Central Committee, had
not written the original he would have
nothing to do with It. Mr. Fritter re
plied that the letter was all right.
Mr. Fritter, when charged with the for
gery, said thatthe letter was sent by a
person who has since gone to Chico. The
Grand Jury has sent to Chico for thia
man, as it considers him' an important
witness. The Grand Jury will delay its
Investigation until this witness arrives.
Temporary Triumph of Democrats.
SAN* JOSE, Nov. 16.â The Board of Su
pervisors to-day decided to capvass the
vote of Owen D. Richardson for City
Justice and Martin Murphy for County

why they have not done so. They at once
took up the work, and certificates of elec

BAD DREAMS
Caused by Coffee.
"I hav* been a coffee drinker, more or

few months ago I became more andjnore
nervous and irritable, and finally I could
not sleep at night for I was horribly dis-
'.urbei by dreams of all torts and a
Â«pcc!es of distressing nightmare.
" Finally, after hearing the experience of
numbers of friends who had quit coffee
Â»r.d gone to drinking Postum Food Cof-
:<**. and learning of the great benetft*
hey had derived, I concluded coffee must
d* the cause of my trouble, so I got some
Posturn Food Coffee and had It mad"
â¢trJctly according to directions.
"I was astonished at the flavor and
:a.ne. It entirely took the piace of cof-
'*Â¦*. and. to my very irreat satisfaction. 1
vgan to sleep peacefully and sweetly.
My nerves improved and I wish I could
*arn every man. woman and child from

"People really do not appreciate or
â¢<-alize what a powerful drug it is and
â¢ hat terrible effect it has on the human
5VFtem. If they did. hardly a pound of

5f going back to coffee again. I would
tlmoet as soon think of putting my hand
n a fire after I had once been burned.
"A young lady friend of .ours. Miss
Emily Plerson, had stomach trouble for a

i* she used coffee. She finally quit cof-

after the tortuous curves and angles that
may arise. J. F. Pettinglll. once famed as
a starter, but now occupying a higher po
sition In Eastern and Middle Western turf
circles, will preside In the Judges' stand.
He will have as his associate Ed Cole, a
prominent New York sporting writer and
a" .very keen observer of .things. Ed Power
will act as clerk of the scales, as he did
for the Western Turf Association last
season.. George Parsons, a well-known
English gentleman steeplechase rider, will
be at the head of the stretch.
Richard Dwyer, or "Dick" as he Is hail

to the devotees of the sport, duck hunting
has not been up to the uauii mark this

PARK COURSING
A BETTER TEST
FOR THE HOUND
Judge Grace Compares
Work on Plains With
That in the Park.
Silent Treasure escaped from the bng
jtasre car of the Modesto bound train on
Monday evening and has nnt yet been
found. It was at Lathrop that the ioa
broke loose.
GETTING READY
FOR BENCH SHOW
It is not the opportunity offered for f no
coursing that draws the leashmen to lha
plains; it is the complete variation in th?
sport. Very little of an actual course ca i
be seen by the attendants, except by thÂ»
extremely limited few that follow on
horseback. And the real test of a hound's
merit is not brought out in the plains.
This Js what Judge Grace has to say
about plains coursing: "You hear a groat
deal about the true test of the worth or
a dog being the work it can do on the
plains. This Is not so. In fact, it is ?ar
from the truth. On the plains luck Is th.Â»
greatest factor in detesraining the result*
of courses. A dense stubble, a tumbril
weed, a streak of sandy soil may In real
ity determine a race. In the parks all
this is equalized. You have the sam<Â»
natural conditions at ail times and every
dog has an equal chance. For the naen
Â¦who like to Â¦watch a course the park i-Â»
the place to see It." Yet this annuul
journey has become a fixture: deserve-llv
so. for It Is a touch of the real old spsr*
when following the hounds was a pastime
and a recreation.
Few of the followers of coursing as
seen In parks have any idea of the work
an open meeting entails upon the jud^e.
There Is no rest for him from the mo
ment he gets in his saddle unui he signi
fies that the work of the dav is over.
Then again, his eye must Le compassed on
all four points for the elusive hare must
be sighted by the judge as soon as thu
slipper. Very often a course means a
three or four-mile ride, after which thurÂ«
la no rest, for the cavalc?de and line of
vehicles start Immediately upon his re
turn. The slipper's lot is by no mejr.s
an easy one. When the hares are scare*
as they were last year at Merced and
the first two days of this meeting at Mo
desto his particular labor Is anything hut
Joy-giving. Very often he walks twenty
minutes or a half-hour before a hare 15
sighted. Then he must work his dog 3
until they, too, catch sight of the rabbit.
Hares are not as plentiful In the San
Joaquin plains as tn former years, and; a
stake of the dimensions of the one just
completed is too large to bring: out th<*
best enjoyment of the sport. Although
the leashmen who made the annual Jour
ney this season lost none of their enthu
siasm on the third day. the majority \Â»-aa
more than content to return in a hurry
to San Francisco.
Coursing; men will certainly have had
a great quantity of their favored game
this week when the 12S-dog stake Is fin
ished at Union Park on Sunday after
noon. The plains meet at Modesto, easily
the most sucessful ever held, lasted three
days and kept the leashmen more than
busy from eight In the morning until six
In the afternoon. Now comes the big ICS
dog stake, containing tbe highest cUtsa
hounds. It looks as if Judge Grace va3
being punished for good work.

there will be men's foursomes, over
eighteen holes, medal play, with handicap.
Before the end of the month Alexander
Smith, who wap Instructor at the Coro
nado Golf Club last winter and during the
reason has been a professional at the
Washington Park Club. Chicago, will start
for Coronado. The Coronado course has
hitherto been a nine-hole one. but it will
bÂ« lengthened to eighteen holes. "Willie"
Smith (brother of Alexander) and David
Bell of the Midlothian Country Club will
follow a week or two later and will give
a series of exhibition matches throughout
the State, "Willie" Smith and David Bell
expect to spend the first three month? of
1S01 In this State and to visit Coronado.
Pasadena, Los Angeles, Redlands. Redon

game. In the sixth annual open cham
pionship played at the Chicago Golf Ciub
on October 4 and 5 David Bell was third
and "Willie" Smith fifth, Varden and Tay
lor taking the two first places. Bell and
Smith are both from the famous links of
Carnoustle. in Scotland. Bell's score for
the seventy-two holeÂ« was 323, and "Wil
lie" Smith's score was Â£$. Alex Smith
came thirteenth, with 340.
The event set down on the programme
of the San Francisco Golf Club for next
Saturday is a mixed foursome handicap,
but aÂ£ many of the ladies will be absent
on account of the opera the event will be
deferred. On Thanksgiving day there will
be the regular handicap against bogey,
medal play, beginning at 9:30 a. m.
The San Rafael Golf Club's "best ball"
tournament resulted in R. J. Davis. 42

Â«'lub. has been absent for some time from
the city, but returned on Wednesday. No
tvent is scheduled to take place on the
Fan Rafael links to-day, but on Thanks
giving day a tournament will be held. The
rain has softened the course considerably,
and it Is now in good condition.
The men of class B win probably hold a
pweepstakes tournament, over eighteen
holes, with handicap. The final round will
be played at the convenience of the win
rÂ»rs of to-day's two matches, and will
probably result in a new name being en
praved on the Council's cup in addition to
the two already inscribed thereon.
The opening round of the third compe
tition for the Council** cup for men of
the San Francisco Golf Ciub was playÂ«>d !
last Saturday, only three out of the four
couples being on hand. The winners in the
three matches, over eighteen holes, were

Goodwin and H. Golcher are matched,
Â¦while H. D. Pillsbury will play against S.

Following are the entries for the swim

make the California men fight for vic
tory and gridiron glory.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Nov. 16.â
The Stanford Varsity has been resting
from heavy work during the past week.
After the smashing game played against
Oregon last Saturday,] Coach Yost has
seen fit : to give his men a surcease from
this kind of work.
The only line-up of the week occurred
Tuesday, when the first eleven made good
gains over the second team. On "Wednes
day the Varsity squad went to Berkeley
to witness the California-Nevada game on
the Berkeley campus. Thursday's prac
tice was also light, consisting of sitrnal
work and punting. What may prove to
be the most serious loss of tho season was
the calling home of Quarterback Raltt on
account of the sickness of his father.
Â¦\Vcrd was received here late this evening
that the father of the Varsity quarter
back had passed away. Raitt's return
to college 'is very doubtful. Coach Yost
says his loss will be irreparable to the
team. He considers Raltt one of the best
quarters in the country. With him in
the back field or passing the ball the toam
has a confidence that the presence of no
other man In college can, give it. Should
Raitt not return in time for the Thanks
giving game his place will be filled by
either Bansbach or Erb. The latter has
had the* most experience, being sub-Var
sity quarter for several years. Bansbach.
however, is a remarkable field general,
strong in' interference and sure in hand
ling punts in the back field. His excel
lent showing in the recent freshman
game when he captained his victorious
team also stands In his favor. Practical
ly the whole team is now ready for the
final practices. The only exception is De
Forest at guard, who is still out with an
arm swollen by blood poisoning. -
Behind the line Slaker at full, Hill and
Smith, halves, are practically sure of
their positions. Lee at center has gained
the lead on McFadden by his vigorous of
fensive game last Saturday. Seeley and
De Forest, -guards; Burnett and Traeger,
tackles, and Cooper and Tommy McFad
den.ends,.will probably complete*the list
of forwards,/ The last preliminary game
of the season will be played next Satur
day\on the campus with Nevada. As the
sagebrush eleven has already played a
0-22 game with California, â¢ this match
will be an excellent opportunity for form
comparisons. Â¦ .
Commencing with next week secret
practice will be begun within the walled
oval on the campus. Tuesday's and Thurs
day's practice only will be public. This
means that the team will not leave the
campus this year for, the last few days'
practice as has heretofore been the cus
tom. â¢
The sale of tickets for the Thanksgiving
game commences here at 2 o'clock next
Monday. Scats will also be put on sale
at the same time in Berkeley and San
Francisco at the customary places.

vada on Wednesday revealed some serious
elownesLs and crudity in offensive play,
which was surprising after the fast ball
the Varsity has already played. The fine
men especially, advance the ball in very
poor style. i Â¦ . .
.The open positions on the Varsity are
E^Â® hÂ°H? tf i Ul th Â£& ever - R 'Sht guard is
now held by O'Toole. a comparatively
green man, who has played up steadily
past Luce and Dunbar. and now seems
likely to beat out Stow, who was. the
lavorite for that place a week ago. - A?l
the candidates are lacking in any thor
ough knowledge of their game and will
need a lot of coaching to fit them for cred
itable work on Thanksgiving day.
Left ' end will â¢ probably go to Hudson,
who is small but very active, and has im
proved greatly in the last week. All
chances for getting Starr or Hill into the
game have vanished, leaving the only two
available candidates Hudson and Dlbblee
Captain Pringle will not try to play be
fore next Monday. He is too valuable a
man to be experimented with, especially
as no satisfactory substitute for his posi-.
tion has been developed. Castlehun has

Gammon's brilliant work In the last two
games and in practice has made him as
likely a man as Duden or Mini for left
half. Minis lightness and Duden s In
juries also give him a greater advantage.
Overall and Braly are both lighting dog
gedly for fullback. The latter man knows
his srame better but does not do all he Is
capable of. Overall's work has been a
trifle erratic, but. lr. the main, he plays a
very strong game and is considered to
have wen the place.
TWO intercollegiate games is the
football programme to-dayâ the
University of California and the
University of Oregon teams on
the Berkeley campus, and Stan
ford and Nevada on the Palo Alto field.
Vp to date California has met Nevada

George F. Whitney, tennis champion of
the Pacific Coast, wili retire from the
courts. Not because he has won racket
honors without number, not because he
holds more cups than he -has cabinets to
house them, not because he feels his pow
ers in the decline has Georjre Whitney
decided to retire once and for all from
tournament play. A physician's peremp

Brasher aroused the neighborhood with
his lamentations. The outcries brought

At a late hour to-night he wag still busy

NEW TORK. Nov. 15.â Speaking o*
Richard Croker's advocacy of a purity
movement" in Greater New York, Rev.
Charles H. Parkhurst says deathbed re
pentances are always discredited. Virtue
that proceeds from fright is no symptom
of change at heart. This panic stricken
condition of Tammany's chief will only
give new vigor to concerted movements
that are being made for bis overthrow.
"Croker's proposition to co-Â«perate> with
other organizations of the city for the In
vestigation of the vice question is a cow
ardly bluff. I had always given him cred
it for having the courage of his depravity,
but by pretending to be virtuous he has
resigned his last claim to admiration and
shown himself to be as much of a pol
troon as he is a knave."
Bishop Henry C. Potter has addressed
the folio wincr to Mayor Van Wyck:
"I protest with all my power against the
condition of things. In which vice ia not
only tolerated, but shielded and encour
aged, by those whose sworn duty it Is to
repress and discourage it.
"I protest in the name of girl3 and their
mothers who have in them every instinct
of virtue and purity. Their sensibility to
insult and outrage is as keen as those who
live in your household or mine.
"I protest against the habitual Insult,
persistent menace and unutterable defiling
contacts to which day by day. because oi
the base complicity of the poiice of New
Tork with the lowest forms of vice and
crime, they are subjected.
"I call upon you. sir, to save these peo
ple, who in every real way are committed
to your charge, from a living hell, de
filing, deadly, damning, to whicit the crim
inal supineness of constituted authorities
set for the defense of decency and gewa
order threatens to doom us.
"The situation which confronts, us In
this metropolis of America is one of com
mon and open notoriety, and of such a
nature as may well make us a byword
among the cations of the world."
Richard Croker said to-day: 'The one
man most responsible for the existence ot
vice in New York City to-day is Dr. Park
hurst. He scattered vice all over the c:ty
and even into Brooklyn. If.it had not
been for him there would not have been
any cries for lelief from the East Side
West Side or any other part of the city. "
"Instead of discrediting the efforts "of
other people he ought to look to his own
work.
"If. however, any police captain, com
missioner or district leader is" found to be
protecting or upholding vice he should be
removed from his position and punished."
Says Tammany Chieftain Is
a Poltroon and a
Knave.

LEAVENWORTH, Kans., Nov. 15,-One
of the most daring and successful es
capes on record was made by three con
victs at the State Penitentiary at Lan
sing this afternoon. The aash for liberty
for one, at least, was brief, as he fell
with a bullet through his head from Dep
uty "Warden Thompson's revolver before
he could gain cover.
The convictsâ Sam Smith, under death
sentence; E. F. Estell and Ben Cravensâ
during odd moments in the coal mine had
fashioned a "dummy" revolver out of
wood, covering the same with tin foil.
This afternoon the guard at the bottom
of the pit suddenly found himself looking
into the muzzle of what he thought was
a 52 -caliber revolver. At the same time
he -was commanded "hands up." Tne
guard was compelled to give the signal
to "lift up," and on reaching the top the
quartet passed the top guard unchal
lenged, the one accompanying the con
victs being afraid to give the alarm. Get
ting outside the inclosure Guard Heweitt
was overpowered and his Winchester and
ammunition was taken from him. Auer
passing another post, occupied by Guard
Murray, the convicts broke and ran.
Guard Swartz seized Murray's gun and
began firing, the fire being returned with
such effect that Swartz was severely
wounded.
Deputy -arden Thompson was at
tracted by the shooting, drew his re
volver and fired, shooting Smitb in the
head," the wound being mortal. A general
fusiuade was opened, when another con
vict was seen to fall, but his body was
drawn to cover by his 'â¢"mrade. who is
Intrenched In a ravine. The place is sur
rounded but owing to tne misty mgut
nothing other than an exchange of shots
may be done before morning. Later re
ports from , I>a.nsing state that the two
prisoners are surrounded in a thicket
three miles west of the Prison. A fusil
lade is being carried on between the offi
cers and convicts. No one has been hit
among the posse.

JAIL IN KANSAS
DURING his stay in New York
Jockey Johnny Bullroan became
a great admirer of Terry Mc-
Govern, and in the room, set
apart for riders and their valets
at Oakland track tried one of the Brook
lyn terror's_swings on the Jaw of "Monk"
Coburn yesterday. It proved a magnifi
cent effort, for "Monk" nearly carried a
window, sash with him- in his fligtxt
through spaced â For -several minutes he
was completely "out," and when revived
asked how many mounts he had won, and
whether McKinley or Bryan was elected.
Trouble between the two riders originated
over a complaint lodged with the judges
earlier in the week by Coburn, the latter
stating that Bullman threatened to put
him over the fence. After the Diderot-
Vulcaln finish yesterday Bullman says
Coburn "Joshed" him, whereupon he be
came incensed and let go a right-hander
that made most accurate connections.
The matter was reported io the Judges,
who, after investigating the affair, sus
pended Bullman for thirty racing days.
He will not even be allowed to ride for
gam Hildreth, to whom hÂ° is under con
tract, and during- the time the ruling Is
in effect will be excluded from the course.
This looks like severe punishment for a
trivial offense, still turf officials must see
that proper decorum Is observed among
riders, owners and trainers. .Bullman is
the star rider here with a large following
of bettors, and the whole thing is re
grettable. The severest sufferer, though,
is Owner Hildreth, who haa a big stable
of cracks, and is now left without a rider
and no available material in sight.
The track was in a very sloppy condi
tion from the heavy rainfall, confusing
the "dope" students and handicappers to
a considerable extent. First Call and
Lavator were* the only winning favorites.
Although it had been passed around as
tho real thing, as good as 14 to a could be
had about First Call, favorite for the
first event. Kiley had the mount and by
hard urging struck the wire winner, a
nose before; St. Anthony. Grey Rob Hn
ished third, alter leading to the paddock.
Lavator at odds on around post time,
only galloped to beat the Bmall consign
ment starting in the seven-furlong run
following. Wyoming made his tirst ap
pearance this season, running a good sec
ond and three lengths in advance of
Monda.
There was an awful scramble to get
aboard Fonsovannah, one of the eight
starters for the next number, a sprint
over six furlongs. J. Daly was never
able to get him even close to the leaders.
In a driving tinlsh and after she had led
from the start. Nora Ives downed Maud
Ferguson a neck on the wire. Dominick
piloted the winner.
Green Morris scratched Modrine from
the handicap, leaving only three to face
the barrier. Hlldreth's Vulcain, carry
ing 114 pounds, was installed an even
money favorite, later drifting to 3 to â¢ 2
on a report that he was not partial to
muddy tooting. The two-year-old Dide

DZCLAEES THE HUMAN
RACE IS DEGENXBATTNG
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Nov. 15.-
Dr. J. H. Kellogg, Burgâ¬on-ln-chief of the
Battle Creek Sanitarium, lectured on col
lege athletes to-day in the university
chapel. Dr. Kellogg Introduced statistics
showing that the human race is degener
ating at a rapid rate physically. Lunacy,
he said, had increased 30") per cent. :
"Modern civilization," said he, "do*3
much to increase the physical degenera
tion of the people, who are getting wiser,
but weaker. The average man of to-day
is not e<iual to the stronz man of one
hundred years ago. A great majority of
the people, and especially students, have
curvature of the spine."
Continuing, he said that many football
men were not physically strong because
they broke off training so suddenly at
Thanksgiving. Study did not hurt any
one, he said, but it was the sitting eo lon<
in one position.

DENVER, Nov. 16.â Joe Gans of Balti
more knocked out Kid Parker of Denver
in ihe fourth round of what was to have
bttn a 'ten-round go before the Colorado
Athletic Association here to-nlsht. A
sharp right hook landed under Parker's
leit tar uuished the battle and was placed
so Quickly that the sptetators could not
reatlaÂ« uiat Parker naa oeen hit. He
seemeti to have been seized with an at
tack ot" L.liiia staggers, and after being
counted out he arose to his feet slowly
iinu groped his way around the ring until
oite vi. iiis sctunua in led mm in his arms
a.ua c&rneo turn to ins corner. Atter ne
nau recovered sumciirntly to move unas
sisieu ne inquired ot neicree George Slier
if he had been counted out and was wiyi
ulum.Uio uutinua or me irutn. Parkers
managtr and chief second, liniy Edwards,
as^ertea mat fciler nad counted unusually
fast, and tnat in rtality but six secunos
ui time i:ad elapsed wnen Siler declared
ParKer out ana awarded the contest to
uans.
The men weighed in "this afternoon at
3 o'clock, Parker tipping tne beam at 1S2^
l>ounds and Gans ut i&S^. Both men
looked in gooa condition, though Parker
appeared a little too tineiy trained.
At nrst Parker appeared nervous and
sparred cautiously, uans tried to draw
him out and s*nt him to the floor twice,
once with a. straight leit to the jaw and
again with a itit swing to the same place,
iii the second rcuna uans wauea and
Parker tried several swings, wnich were
peatly biockea. fa.rK.tr men smashed his
right into Joe's booy several times and
got right and leit swings to tne head,
ihis success gave him courage anu lie
rusntd Joe, Â«no uppercut him hard on
tne jaw as they clinched. There wajj
sHarp innghung, loliowed by clinches,
Parker complaining to the referee that
Joe was holding him. Parker started otf
in the third d> swinging hard on Gans'
head with his right ana Gans split tne
Kid's ear with a vicious left swing. Joe
swung right and left to Parker's head
as they worked toward the latter's cor
ner, joe then uppercut Parker on the
stomach and swung his right to the Kid's
ear. ParKer tried to clinch and received
a hard r:ght uppercut on the jaw. In a
mix Gans landea right and .lett on body
and Parker countered hard over the
heart, which made Gans wince. Parket
put his right hard to Joe's jaw as they
uroke from a clinch. Joe returned the
compliment and both landed hard over
each other's heart as the gong sounded.
Cans began the fourth witn a right over
the heart, following: witn a left to the
jaw and a right to the head. A light left
to forehead and right to head by Gans
and a hard left by barker to Uans' stom
ach followed. Cians put his left to the
Kid's head and right to body, and block
ed a ternnc left-aimed blow at the jaw.
There was an exchange of body blows
and Parker swung right to shoulder, Gans
countering on body. Joe then swung his
right to the Kid's head and Parker put
two hard rights on the jaw, which made
Joe cautious. They mixed it up, neither
appearing much damaged and were spar
rmg when Joe hooked his right under
Parker's ear, putting nim down and out.
The blow was sent in so quickly that
few besides Referee Siler knew what
had happened to the Kid. and there were
inquiries from all sides as to what was
the matter with Parker, many thinking
that he had been overcome by vertigo.

STANFORD TEAM'S
NEW DEPARTURE
NEW YORK. Nov. 16.â While Jeffrtes
was telling: his friends' in New Tork to
day that under no circumstances would
he ever fight Ccrbett again, the latter
made an announcement in Chicago to the
effect that arrangements were being made
for another battle with the champion.
Jeffries justified his refusal to box Corbett
by saying that he cannot afford to injuie
his reputation after the McCoy scandal.
PRIZE WINNERS
AT POULTRY SHOW
"I would rather lose the purses in tt\s
two fights I am taking on," added the
champion, "than to have either of them
spoken of as was the Corbett-McCoy
tight."
Among other things about his alleged
match with Jeffries, Corbett said: "If 1
meet him in the six round bout in Chicago
I trill force the fighting from start to fin
isn. There will be little foot work or run
ning away with me, for I intend to go at
him from the tap of the gong and will
only use my foot work when it is posi
tively necessary."
Gus Ruhlln, at Mahanoy City, Pa., to
day signed articles to fight with Jeffries
after amending them so as to read, "The
referee shall interpret the rules."
?
Though the San Mateo Hunt Club will
not settle down to the regular work of
the season until a heavy and continuous
rain shall have softened the hard ground,
there will be meets every Saturday and
public holidays. This morninp at 9:30 the
members of the Hunt Club will breakfast
at Moormead, J. J. Moore's place at Fair
Oaks, and will take a run afterward.
Next Saturday the hounds will meet at
the same place at 2:30 p. m. and will run
in a southerly direction, the return being
made by train- On Thanksgiving day th-j
pack will be laid on at the Burlir.game
Stock Farm. Frank Carolan, the master
of the Hunt Club, is at present in the
Hast, but will be back m California in
the tlrst week of December.
The kennels which were burned down
a few months after their completion have
been rebuilt and are in good order. The
pack if in charpe of Huntsman Keating.
Five couples, sent out from Ireland by-
Mr. Burke, are on their way to Cali
fornia. To these Irish-bred hounds will
be added eight or ten couples of American
breeding brought by Frank Carolan. The
pack is considerably in need of new
blood, ha vine been lnbreu too much, and
several of the hounds being too old for
fast work. Keatlng-'s experiment in cross
ing American fox hounds with English
bred bitches did not turn out very well.
He has, however, some handsome pup
pies, six couples of which are already be
ing: hunted. The attendance at the meets
is light at present, ar.Â« the members will
not turn out in full force until the going
-s easier for the horses.

QUAY, CLARK AND 0DDICKS;
r~X ESPITE the thoroughness of the Republican
J ) victory in the country at large there are sev
*â eral minor issues of the election on which the
decision of the people is doubtful, and out of some
of them there are likely to come one or more of those
Senatorial deadlocks that have been so annoying of
late years. Clark is fairly sure at last of victory in
Montana, for he is said to have fifty-five out of nirtety
four members of the. Legislature, and, besides, his
great antagonist, Daly, is dead. In Pennsylvania and
Delaware, however, the old fight goes on. The elec
tions have left matters in doubt, and it remains to be
seen whether Quay and Addicks will win or whether
the opposition to then will be sufficiently strong to
prevent an election.
Of the two contests that in Pennsylvania is by far
the more interesting. Addicks is a big man nowhere
except in Delaware, but Quay has long been a.politi
cal leader of the first rank, and the. whole country
feels more or less interest in his political fortunes.
The press of Pennsylvania has been carefully study
ing the situation ever since the election, but. wide dif
ferences of opinion exist as to how a majority of the
Republican members stand with regard to the Sena
torial fight. . " - .â¢ 'Â¦; '-' ;.'; /..'. ..--
A Philadelphia correspondent of the Pittsburg Dis
patch stated recently: "A close canvass' of the Legist
lsture to-day gave the Quay men 102 in the House,
anti-Quay 57 and Democrats 45. This would show
a tie as between the stalwarts, and the ''Democrats ''and
insurgents combined. The same calculation- divide
the fifty Senators equally between the stalwarts and
the Democrats and insurgents, making a total disjoint
ballot of 127 for Quay and thesame number for the
combined opposition, but adding to the Quay, total
the twelve votes embraced in the list of caucus anti-
Quay. Senators and members, would give him 139."
The question will turn upon the ability of Quay
to get a number of the so-called "insurgent" Republi
can legislators to go into a caucus and agree to be
bound. by it. His. supporters claim that at least twelve
NICARAGUA OR PANAM0.
ALL signs point to the conclusion that there is
to be a big battle fought between the advo
cates of the Nicaragua route and those of the
Panama route before the country undertakes the con
struction of an isthmian canal. The Panama men are
already at work and are receiving no little support
from influential sources.
Walter Schlecht, a member of the commission, who
has recently returned home after having spent some
time in going over the Panama route, is reported ti>
have said that while it would take the French com
pany which is working there many years to complete
their canal, as it will cost $110,000,000 and they are
only spending about $1,000,000 a ; year, he thought
that the acceptance of that route would save this coun
try about two years' time in the'compietion of a canaL
Mr. Schlecht intimated that the report of the com
mission would present the facts affecting both routes
fully, without recommending either, leaving the Gov
ernment to take its choice. :' 5j ' Â¦
It has been stated that the Panama canal i s now
virtually the property of an American corporation or
ganized under the laws of New Jersey. That com
pany began an active campaign of education in favor
of the Panama route upward of a year ago, and had
sufficient strength to bring about the appointment of
a commission charged with the duty of examining
both routes. It is now going to make the fight with
increased prestige, and the chances are it may block
the enterprise for some time unless the urgent de
niand of the people forces Congress to take action
without further delay. â¢
The great mass of the American people hare" of
course no preferences for either route. What they
wish is a canal constructed along the best route and
in the most economical manner, and they wish that
accomplished as speedily as possible. The fight be
tween the two routes therefore should be settled with
out delay. Eilher route would be better than another
indefinite postponement of the enterprise.

MARYSV1LLE APPEALâ There is no
doubt that if the orange growers of
Northern California would combine on a.
plan similar to that of the prune associa

selves In a position to fix and maintain
rates their receipts would Increase in a
very satisfactory manner, and they would,
moreover, be relieved of a lot of the wor

them.
SANTA BARBARA INDEPENDENTâ
No time should be lost in arranging for a
railroad jubilee, to take place on the first
day of the twentieth century. This is the
day of all days upon which to cejebrate
the new era for Santa Barbara. Let her
begin the new century with a Joyous ac
claim for the grand outlook of the future.
The completion of the coast 'line places
Santa Barbara In as favorable a position
as any artificial aids combined with her
natural advantages can place her.
SANTA ANA BLADEâ Unless the
orange growers of Southern California are
determined upon killing the goose which
lays the golden eggs, they will heed the
warning against shipping fruit in an un
ripe condition. Season after season this
warning is given, and yet there are al
ways to be found a few persons who ship
oranges to the East "for the Thanksgiv
ing trade," which means simply before
they are ripe. This proceeding is sure to
result in injury to all orange growers of
Southern California by giving their fruit
a bad name in the Eastern markets.
SAN DIEGO SUNâ One way for San
Diegans to meet and overcome the infer
nal discrimination made against this port
by the Pacific Mall and other steamship
companies controlled by the railways Is
for. San Diegans to organize and operate
a steamship line of their own, and this
method of procedure is not at all impos
sible. There is idle capital in the city which
could find good Investment in such enter
prise, and there are mariners amply able
to conduct the business and make it pay.
The first trouble would be to secure proper
ships, but v as others find a way to over
come this, so could a San Diego company.

and says that- if the Democratic party

a policy of its own, and not simply be sat

SPIRIT OF CALIFORNIA PRESS.
IS CIVILIZATION CIVILIZED?
HISTORY is being made in the settlement of
matters with China.
The Minister? of the powers, inspired by their
Governments, have desired from the first to proceed
as if the Chinese were not human tfeings, and could
be dealt with accordingly. Xo .barbarous conqueror,
not Attila, Alaric, Genghiz Khan nor Tamerlane, ever
proposed or carried cut a more wanton use of power
over those supposed to be helpless than these repre
sentatives of Christian civilization have proposed
toward China. The only motive apparent from the
first has been revenge. Already a thousand Chinese,
without regard to age or sex, have been killed for
every ten missionaries or foreigners. Millions of
property have been stolen or destroyed. Famine,
with all its horrors, has been brought upon North
China. In addition to all this the execution of Chi
nese leaders after court-martial by European officers
has been demanded and carried out, and now the
death of important personages in that Government is
called for.
We repeat that what the Christian world needs jus;
now is the raising of some voice in behalf of Chris
tianity.
To crown all, it is said that the representatives of
Europe are asking that the tombs of the Ming dy
nasty be destroyed. It seems incredible that such
demands should emanate from a professed Christian
civilization. - They are incompatible with the profes
sion of a desire for peace and commerce with Chin?.
The destruction of the dynastic tombs is an act of
sheer wantonness. Its only effect will be the per
manent embittering, of that vast population. .To say
that all this slaughter, looting, destruction and viola
tion of the dead, in the name of Christianity, is a
necessary prelude to the introduction of Christianity
there is to assume a position that is too fantastic for
belief.
The limit of .economical speed, It Is concluded, has nearly been reached with
the present form o f . hull and motive row<r. To drive the Deutschland thirty knots
insi cad of twenty-three would require 83-000 horse-power, or two and a quarter
times as much ns phe now has.
If the four day liner were built upon present, lines, she would be a vessel 930 feet
lonp, of eighty-seven feet beam and thirty feet draught, displacing about 40.000
tons. Engines of 110,000 horse- power would be required, and even if triple screws
were used, the necessity of developing 37,000 horse-power on each shaft would
stagger the best engine builders. Forty-four double Scctch boilers would be need
ed, and during each day's run 1710 tons of coal, costing: $7700, would have to be
fed into the Â£52 furnaces. It 'would require 7300 tons of coal to carry the vessel
to Plymouth and 8550 tons to Hamburg, the cost of fuel alone being J3S.0OO. ThÂ©
Bhlp would need WJi tons of coal in her bunkers for a single trip across the At-
WHILE a considerable number of persons have
been talking. ever since the election of what
the- Democratic party will .do in the way of
reformation and' reorganization, the business sense of
the country has been much more concerned as tu
what the administration will do. That is the live issue
of the day. It is a matter of work and not of specula
tion, and consequently is infinitely greater impor
tance than . any views that may be had of the future
of Bryan or the menace of Bryanism.
The people of Massachusetts, with their usual prac
tical good sense, have, turned their attention to the
coming work of the administration, and at a recent
banquet of the Middlesex Club Senator Lodge was
engaged to make an address upon the subject. Hardly
any man can speak with more authority upon such
matters than Mr. Lodge, for he is not only a Senator
of force and leading but is close to the administration
and doubtless knows as fully as any one outside the
Cabinet the programme the administration will
recommend.
Speaking of the subject generally the Senator said:
"More was at stake this year than in any election
since 1864, and the victory, means more to the coun
try than any political victory since that time. It is
for us to deserve the trust which the people have re
posed in us. We must reduce taxation by taking off
war taxes wherever they can be spared. We must
maintain the tariff so that our manufacturers may
have stable conditions in their home market to build
upon. We must maintain absolutely the gold stan
dard, and if additional legislation is needed to
Strengthen it that we must pass. We must have legis
lation to develop and build up our merchant marine.
There should be fnrther intelligent restriction of im
migration, and in the next four years the isthmian
canal should be begun."
That in itself is a good programme. The country
has never doubted that the administration will uphold
the protective tariff and the gold standard, but it will
note with gratification the announcement concerning
the upbuilding of our merchant marine, the restriction
of immigration and the prompt construction of tho
isthmian canal. Those great measures have been al
ready too long delayed, and if they be now taken up
and made the special work of the administration there
will be general rejoicing.
The Senator was more elaborate in dealing with the
trusts and with the Philippine problem. He noted
that Bryan gained his strength in the Eastern States!
more, from those issues than from anything else, and
drew -therefrom the conclusion that with them the
Republican party must deal firmly and wisely. He
outlined no particular programme of action upon
either issue, but contented himself with pointing, out
their importance.
Of the trusts he said:- "It is a great subject and
will require the best thought and the highest ability
which we command, for while we seek to root out and
guar -'. against evils we must not throw away advan
tages or by rashness bring ruin to business. It is a
difficult problem, to which the Republican party must
address itself seriously and at once."
Concerning the Philippines he said: "The wise
recommendation of Judge Taft's commission in re
gard to the civil service in those islands should be
embodied in the law. I have believed always and pro
foundly in taking the islands, in holding them and
in making them the cornerstone of our power in the
East; but rather than see their government made the
spoil of political parties in the United States I would
abandon them, for if we. do not govern those islands
as Americans, and not as Democrats or Republicans,
and do not keep them wholly, free from party politics,
our rule there will make us a byword and will bring
disgrace to us arid misfortune to the Filipinos. Ma
terial development, honest and able government, the
largest measure of liberty possible, together with a
steady advance to . self-government and home rule,
such is and such will be, I believe, the policy of Presi
dent McKinlcy and of the Republican party!"
Such is the forecast of the work of the Republican
party for the next four years. It will be received with
satisfaction by all Americans who are not chronically
discontented.' It is a programme of progress. both at
home and abroad, and promises to advance the pros
perity already so gratifying. -"It is safe to say that if
the work be carried out so that four years from now
the Republican party can point to immigration wisely
restricted, a flourishing "and increasing merchant
marine, good government in the Philippines and the
isthmian canal' begun, it will not be difficult for the
party to elect McKinley's; successor -and enter upon
another term of power.

PERSONAL MENTION.
PROBABILITIES of the realization of the dream of a "four day liner" on the
Atlantic highway* are discussed by the Scientific American In Its latest Is
sue. After a comparison of prevailing types of steamships, the conclusion Is
reached that the Atlantic will be crossed In four days by the liner of the
near future. : \
Economic considerations, according: to the authority quoted, have determined,
the lines ufion which the steamships of recent years have been built. .The result
has been' the evolution of two distinct types, illustrated by the Ivernia of the Cu
nard line and the Deutschland of the North German Lloyd. Cost of construction
and of operation increases at a , far greater ratio than mere speed, and this con
sideration chiefly has delayed the advent of the four 6ay liner. The Deutschland,

UTTERANCE
IN VARIETY
THE ROSS INCIDENT.
PRIENDS of the Stanford University feel that
the worst has passed, and can see for the insti
tution a future unharmed by the circumstances
which attended the resignation of Professor Ross.
Whether right or wrong, the position of Mrs. Stan
ford is now satisfactorily demonstrated to be due to
her sensitive loyalty to the reputation and memory
of her husband, and not to any sentiment of sympathy
with aggressive wealth. Her position toward labor
ami its rights is now recalled as it was expressed dur
ing the great railroad strike of 1894. She then owned
one-fourth of the Central and Southern Pacific rail
roads. When the lines were tied up by the strike she
was sojourning at Castle Crags. The strikers con
trolled the line to San Francisco, and, assuring them
of her sympathy, she requested them to give her a
train to this city. This was done, and she was es
corted down the valley in triumph by her own striking
employes, to whom she talked with a freedom that
was exasperating to her partners in the property. She
lold them that if her husband were alive there would
be no strike, that their demands were reasonable and
he would not have hesitated to annul the Pullman
contract, and recognize their, right to dictate the
policy of the company in the matters that were at the
root of the trouble.
Throughout that event she reached the public in
interviews that went further than any one else chose
to go in placing the blame on the Pullman company
and asserting the propriety of a sympathetic strike
under such circumstances. It has been said that jthis
course influenced Mr. Huntington in his determina
tion to extinguish her interest in the property as soon
as he could safely do so. .-.-.Â¦Â¦...... ..'Â¦'..-.
Now, going back to the ethics of that strike, it is
difficult for any one to reconcile. Mrs. Stanford's posi
tion then with any present motive against Professor
Ross that goes to his methods of teaching' or hi9 pub--
Hc expression of scientific conclusions. It may, then
be accepted as true that, right or wrong, her objec
tion is based upon reported expressions not related
to such conclusions, which were taken as reflecting
upon the career of her husband.
Nor can it be said, in view of all the facts, that Pro
fessor Ross' brief participation in the campaign of
1896 as a proponent of free silver was in itself of
fensive. In his later years, during his Senatorial
career, Governor Stanford held and expressed more
radical views on finance than Bryan has advocated.
His financial radicalism raised the greatest anxiety
among his partners and business associates, and ex
tended to foreign holders of the railroad bonds and
securities. He held, concurrently - with these
extreme .financial theories, equally radical views
about the position of labor K and published
them in articles and speeches on co-operation.
He introduced in the Senate a bill on co
operation that was regarded as the essence of
socialism, and caused him to be claimed as a convert
to the theories of that cult. It may be safely said
that if Stanford University were run on the labor,
financial and theories of its two founders
it would appall American conservatism.
This narrows the issue to one affecting only the loy
alty of a widow to the memory of her husband in a
matter purely personal, and perhaps based -upon a
misrepresentation or a misunderstanding of expres
sions used. ,~
Of course every friend of higher education will wish
that even such motives were not present in the ad
ministration of Stanford, but its presence is less harm
ful than the assumed motive of denial of free speech
on the great subject of the rights of mass and class.
The university is visibly steadying again after the
storm. When the sons of Harvard painted the
founder"? statue a bright carmine it did not remove
the foundations of Harvard. Nor will this incident
long disturb the usefulness of. Stanford. That it will
not is due entirely to the known and published views
of the founders themselves, which so far outdo any
radicalism of Professor Ross as to make him seetr.
like a tirhid conservative.
The immediate pressure is greatly relieved by Presi
dent Jordan's convincing showing that the affair was
not suppressed until after the vote on the Stanford
amendment to the constitution of the State. No
trick was played on the voters. The crisis appeared
six days after the election and was not expected at all
prior to that time.
On the showing made since our first reference to
the subject it now appears that academic freedom is
not to be abridged at the university, and scientific
conclusions are to be freely expressed, strike whe-e
they may.
The affair is admonitory.! The Stanford trust in the
university is based in the law of the State. It is now
further embedded in the constitution. .The institu
tion, by seeking and receiving this statutory and
fundamental recognition, becomes quasi-public in its
legal aspect, and the intense attention given to the
Ross incident is notice to all concerned that it must
not seem to be but must. actually be what, appears
intended on the face of the trust. â¢ â¢ *'.
of them can be counted on to do so, but on the
other hand the North American, which speaks for
Wanamaker, fhe leader of the forces against Quay,
says there are a good many members of the Legisla
ture supposed to be for Quay who will vote against
him when the time comes. Between the conflicting
claims outsiders' cannot decide, but it looks as if the
chances of victory are much better for Quay than for
his opponents. '
The Dispatch points out that "there will be no such
excuse for bolting Quay next January as existed last
time when lie was under indictment at Philadelphia
and the. cry 'No trial, no caucus' was good justifica
tion for revolt. Since then he has been rehabilitated
by. the court and indorsed /by his party? and his men
have successfully run the gauntlet of popular elec
tion. Those, therefore, who wish at all to be consid
ered within the pale of party organization will find
it much more difficult than before to find an excuse
for going back on' their party's indorsement of the
'old man.' "
Few people care much about Addicks, but it may
be worth while to note that the Republicans have a
majority of five in the Delaware Legislature and the
greater number of them are for Addicks, but it is
known that some will fight him tjo a finish. His
chances, therefore; are slight. Still it is to be remem
bered he is a tireless and able worker, and such facul
ties generally ,win/as is seen in the case of the untiring
Mr. Clarkof Montana.

UNTTED STATES ARMY TRANSPORT SHERIDAN LEAVING FOR
MANILA WITH A BODY OF RECRUITS.' FOR THE LAST FOUR
MONTHS THE VESSEL HAS BEEN UNDERGOING REPAIRS.
and heroes fiercer than both raise their poenvs
or plays with the simile of Joseph Andrews,
who U himself above the reach of any simile.
Fielding's work Is also full of the merely
comic. Too often he descends to the buf
loonery. the coarse epithet.*, the ludi
crous situations and hard blows of the
early comedy. The battle royal between
Moll Seagrim and her detractors, where
the lusty amazon puts to ignominious
night the whole parish. Is humor of the
most elementary nature. Parson Adams
is beaten In almost every chapter of "Jo
seph Andrews.' . He Is continually the vic
tim of ludicrous circumstances. He falls
Into Parson Trulliber's pig sty. He is
struck full In the face by a panful of
nog blood, thrown by an angry amazon;
he is assailed by a kitchen maid with a
soaking mop. There is no end to the
tricks which the author plays upon him.
All this is humor In Its crudest form, yet
It is all the humor that many can appre-
The leading charm of Fielding lies In
his nearness to nature. He Is not always
cleanâ what that has come out of the eignt
eenth century is?â but he is never Im
moral. He is as wholesome as nature
herself. Squire Weston Is admirably
drawn. His loud halloo echoes through
the pages of "Tom Jones" like the bay of
hounds through a forest. He 13 close to
nature, joyous as a spring morning- and aa
fresh and free. When Tom lies very sick
he Insists on serenading him each morn
ing under his window with the shrill
blasts of his horn. He is in full pursuit
of his runaway daughfer Sophia when a
pack of hounds in full cry crosses hi3
track. Instantly all thoughts of hia
daughter are lost, and with a mighty
shout he dashes In pursuit of the flylns
pack. "The hounds ran very hard and
the squire pursued over ditch and hedga
with all his usual vociferation and nlac,
rlty and with all his usual pleasure."
Such a picture could come only from the
pen of a true humorist. /
The only other novelist of the era
worthy to be mentioned with Fielding as
a humorist Is Laurence Sterne. whosÂ«
reputation rests almost wholly upon his
novel. If It may be called a novel. "Trist
ram Shandy" (lTon). This chaotic volume
Is certainly one of the curiosities of Eng
lish literature. It is without plot, with
out form and order, without consecutive
Interest. The hero is not born until well
toward the middle of the volume and he
Is hardly out of dresses when the storv
closes. It is a mere jumble of eccentrici
ties. The reader Is constantly surprised
by some fantastic conceit; blackened
pages or blank leaves suddenly confront
him; omitted chapters to bÂ« filled In by
his imagination; pages of asterisks anil
periods: lines and grotesque curves: chap
ters consisting of a single sentenceâ no
mechanical trick has been omitted. ThÂ»
reader is never prepared for the next
chapter. "If I thought you were able."
the author declares, "to form tho least
Judgment or probable conjecture to your
self of what was to come in the next
page. I would tear It out of my book."
Mrs. Shandy at a keyhole Is on the point
of learning what she supposes to be an
Important secret, but at the critical mo
ment we are disappointed:
L&ying the edge of her lingers across her two
l!ps. holding in her breath and bending her
bead a little downward, with a twist of her
neck (not toward the door, but from It. by
which means her ear was brought to the chink)
she listened with all her powers.
In this attitude I am determined to let her
stand for five minutes, till I bring up the af
fairs of the kitchen to the same period.
One should never read "Tristram
Shandy" for its story. It is without form
and it would be void were it not for Its
characterization and its humor. My
Uncle Toby Is one of the few really liv
ing figures in English literature. In
creating him Sterne shows what he might
have done had he been content to leave
his fantastic conceits and make an honest,
earnest picture of life. "Were the whole
of "Tristram Shandy" equal in merit to
it3 best passages it might stand as one
of the supreme masterpieces of literature.
Sterne was a sentimentalist. "Humor
and pathos," says Raleigh, "are never In
their nature far apart; In Sterne they are
almost Inextricably combined. His laugh
ter and his tears are so facile and their
springs He so near together that the one
almost Infallibly provokes the other."
There is nowhere a better picture of a
kindly soul than Sterne's Uncle Toby.
'My Uncle Toby had scarce a heart to re
taliate upon a fly. "Go," says he one day at
dinner, to an overgrown one which had buzzed,
about his nose and tormented htm cruelly all
dlcner time, and which, after Infinite attempt*
he had cautht at last as it flew by him. "I'll
cot hurt thee." says my Uncle Toby, rising
from his chair and ?olnsr across the room with
the fly In his hand; "I'll not hurt a hair of
thy head. Go." says he. lifting up the sash
and opening his hand as he spoke to let it es
cspe: "go. poor devil: get thee gone: why
should I hurt thee?. This world surely Is wide
enough to bold both thee and tne."
It is not easy to give a sample of the
humor of Sterne. It is pervasive and not
easy to Isolate. "It Is, says Cross, "a
kind of humor that evokes only the gen
tlest emotions of pity to be followed: by
the smile. It enfranchises the heart,
purging it of melancholy and giving zest
to the mere bagatelles of existence."
FRED LEWIS PATTEE.

Permitted to See Her Children.
Judge Daingerfleld made an order yes
terday permitting Mrs. Caroline Blrdsall,
formerly the wife of Captain Thomas J.
Cunningham of Company K. California
Volunteers, to tee her two children, now
In the custody of their father, .twice a
month. Captain Cunningham secured a
divorce from his former wife several
months ago, and since that time has re
fused to permit her to see her children.
Two School Suits.
The petition for a writ of mandate filed
by .George Bates to compel the Board of
Education to reinstate him aa High School
instructor of Latin was argued before*
Judge Hunt yesterday and submitted for
decision. The action by which Superin
tendent Webster seeks to compel the
board to recognize Ms assistant during his
absence at meetings of the board was con
tinued for a week.
. . Reader, we - would make a simile â¢ en - this
occasion, - but for two reasons: The fli-st Is it
would interrupt- the description. Â¦ which shouid
be rapid in 'this part: but that doth not welsh
much, many precedents occurring for such an
Interruption: the, second, and much the greater
reason is. that we could find no simile udequalb
to. our purposed for. indeed, what instance
could ,we bring to set before our reader â¢>>â¢Â«Â»
at once the Idea of friendship, courage, youth,
beauty, strength and "swiftness? 'All which
blazed. In the -person of Joseph : Andrews. Let
those, , therefore, that describe iiona and - tigers
; As a miser who hath In some well-built city
a value 20 shillings, when at Â» dis
tance "he Is alarmed with the news rf nre.
turns pale and .trembles at his-loss; but when
hÂ«- finds the .beautiful palaces only are burnt
and -.his own cottage remains Â»afe - he comes
Instantly to himself and â¢ smiles at his good
fortune;, so. Sophia, etc.
'But sometimes r.o comparison can sat
isfy him. . . '
- We are never sure whether Fielding Is
In earnest or not. "It seems," says Low
ell, '.'as - If the two lobes of the brain
were never in perfect unison, so that If
ever one of them be on the point of sur
rendering itself to a line frenzy of un
qualified enthusiasm, the other watches
over it, makes fun of It, renders it un
easy with a vague sense of lncongrulty
till at last it Is forced to laugh when ;it
had rather, cry."
: He gravely pretends that "Tom Jones"
is a kind of. comic "Iliad." differing from
Homer only in Its treatment of the more
humble circles of life. Instead of battles
between gods and heroes we have fierce
fights between kitchen maids and awk
ward â¢,boors-^"as -bloody a battle â¢ as can
possibly be fought without. the assistance
of steel or . cold iron." He introduces
elaborate Homeric similes:
- But while the captain was one day busted In
deep contemplations of this kind one of tho
most unlucky a* welt as unseasonable accident*
happened to him. The utmost malice of. for
tune could Indeed have contrived nothing so
cruel, so malapropos, so absolutely destructive
to all his schemes. In short, not to keep the
reader In long suspense. Just at the very lu
stant when his heart was exulting In medita
tions on thÂ« happiness which would accrue ta
him by Mr. All worthy's death, he himself die.i
of. an apoplexy. . 'Â¦
-The whole atmosphere of the book Is
one of sly fun. The very titles of the
chapters are amusing: "The reader's
neck, brought. Into danger by a descrip
tion; his escape." "The morning Intro
duced In ' some line writing." "Containing
one of the most bloody battles, or rather
duels, that were ever recorded In domes
tic history." "Better worth reading than
all the works of Colley- Clbber and many
others." - . .
â¢Fielding Is full of these little hits. His
Â§ages bubble, over with good nature,
omctlmes he laughs boisterously, but
more often he chuckles slyly to himself
over, the weaknesses, the vanities, the
petty -foibles of humanity. .-.,'.- â¢
' Sophia, for instance. Is In deep distress
over the misfortunes of Jones. "Oh. wick
ed, wicked eyes." she cries, "that have
wrought all -this \ mischief. How can I
ever hold them up again?" Yet. all the
time she Is regarding with great satisfac
tion her image In the mirror. Again.
Parson' Adams, to convince Wilson -.of
his supreme contempt for vanity, offers
to- walk ten miles to fetch his sermon on
that vice. In the same novel the coun
try-huntsman, whose dogs have attacked
the. parson, calls them off at once for fear
that they will be spoiled by following
vermin. Note -the Irony in this episode
of Captain . nilfll. who â¢ spent much time
every day considering how liable Mr. All
worthy, whose heir he was to be, was
to-dle of apoplexy: , /,,, . . ;
Â¦ Again when Parson Adams Is sent to
the rich Parson Trulllber to borrow the
fow shillings that will relieve his great
distress, since the good parson has a wide
reputation for charity, the word seldom
belnjr out of his. sermons, he is received
at first with incredulity, then with actual
Insults. The parson is' even meditating
violence, when his wife/ seeing him clench
his fist, interposes and begs him not to
fight, "but 'to show himself a true Chris
tion and take the law of him.
for nothing would give him more pleasure than
to hear they were taken." "That." cries Bar
nabas, "Is for the sake of justice." "Yes."
said Joseph, "but if I was to meet them again
I am afraid I should attack them and kill
them, too, if I could." "Doubtless." answered
Barnabas, "it Is lawful to kill a thief; but can
you say you ' forgive them as a Christian
ought?" Joseph desired to know what that
forgiveness was. "That is," answered Barna
bas, "to forelve them as â as â it is to forgive
them as â In short, it Is to forgive them as a
Christian." Joseph replied, he forgave them
as- much as he could. "Well, well." said Bar
nabas, "that will do."
â¢He then questioned him concerning his for
giveness of the thieves. Joseph anawered:
The leading characteristic of this early
fiction Is Its realism. It studies human
lives and human society, not from the
model, but 'from ruiture. Like Shake
speare's dramas. It gives a faithful pic
ture of its age. Its Incidents may have
been drawn from imagination ; and Its
characters may never actually, have had
corporeal existence. It matters not. We
know that, we have the very atmosphere
of the period; we visit the rural cottage,
the country inn, the humble vicarage, the
hall of. the country squire, the fashion
able drawing room; we learn how the
common people actually lived, what they
talked about and laughed about, and how
they looked at life. This is the truest
kind of history. A single book, of Field
ing's gives us a more graphic picture of
tHe middle' eighteenth century than a
whole shelf ot formal histories. In a book
liks "Tom Jones" or "Koderick Kan
dom" we get a full breath from tne actual
Kngland of the early Ueorges.
Tne master humorl#t among the early
novelists was Henry i?1elding, a man who
in very many ways reminds ua of tne gen
ial Richard Steele. Both were impulsive
and Improvident, fond of convivial Joys
ana" rec-Kless living, and both were kind
hearted, loyal to tneir friends and full of
huarty good cheer and sunny optimism.
As a novelist Fielding was the direct
forerunner of Thackeray and Dickens.
Through all his work there runs a fierce
Intolerance of shams, of snobberyt of op
pression of the weak by the strong, of In
sincerity and Injustice. "Joseph Andrews"
is a kind of "Pilgrim's Progress." Al
most tho entire book Is taken up with the
details of .a single journey In which in
nocence and simplicity, personified by An
drews and Fanny- and Parson Adams>. find
at almost every step some new fcrm of
wickedness to destroy them. During their
progress they come in contact with al
most every form of human weakness.
They encounter the hypocritical church
man, the ignorant and cruel lawyer, the
unjust Judge, the lewd peasant, the cring
ing and fawning yet heartless landlord,
the fine lady, fastidious concerning the
proprieties, yet at heart thoroughly im
moral, and everywhere selfishness and
vanity and obsequlence to money and
power. The whole vain and cruel age is
before us, held up for us to laugh at. But
there Is never any spite at Individuals,
never any misanthropy In Fielding's
satire. "We who are admitted behind the
scenes of this great theater of nature," he
declares in one place "(and no author
ought to write anything besides diction
aries and spelling books who hath not
this privilege) can censure the action with
out conceiving any absolute detestation of
the person whom, perhaps, nature may
not have- designed to act an 111 part In
all her dramas." The satire Is never di
rected against the person; it is the act
that is held up to ridicule. We Join In
the author's full, hearty laugh, but we
feelat the same time the deep pathos that
underlies It all.
Joseph, sorely wounded, "Is visited by
Parson Barnabas;
i The creation of the novel In its modern
form opened a rlcji field for English
humor. Until the midyears of the eigh
teenth century all studies of human life
and society had taken dramatic or poetic
form, but in 1740 Samuel Richardson dis
covered almost by accident that even the
most complex series of human emotions
and adventures and Incidents could be
adequately treated in an ordinary prose
narrative. No discovery has ever borne
fruit ,-so Immediate and so abundant.
Within twelve years there was produced
a veritable library of classic novels:, "Sir
Charles Grandison." "Joseph Andrews,"
'.'Roderick Random." "Humphry Clink
er," "Tristram Shandy," and many
others.

Arrives From Australasia With Much
MAIL STEAMER MAKIPOSA.
THE transport Sheridan sailed
for Manila yesterday after a
thorough overhauling. Those- who
were privileged to go over the
vessel in the morning scarcely
knew her. as to all Intents and purposes
she is a new ship. The Fulton Iron Works
put in 120 working days^on her. and Cap
tain Batchelder ar.d Captain Barneson
and Supervising Engineer Mathews and
his assistant. James H. Humphreys, saw :
to it that nothing but the best kind of
work was done. s
Among the alterations made on the
Sheridan was the strengthening of the
spar deck; a stringer four feet wide and
e plate four feet wide extending the full
length of the ship, with the necessary tie
plated, were put in; the sheer streak
abreast of No. 4 hatch was removed and
new and heavier plates were put in; cargo
hatches abreast of ports were reduced in
6ire; new hatch combings of steel were
provided for upper dec-Ks and regular
aeck frames were put in the wake of the
hatches; boat frames were lengthened;
the amidship house was extended twenty
two feet; the dining saloon was rear
ranged so as to accommodate seventy-six
persons at a sitting; nine staterooms
were added over- the saloon; a new
bridge was built abaft the mainmast and
also a house containing captain's quar
ters and rooms for the first, second, third
and fourth officers; a smoking room was
added to the after part of the promenade
deck; the hospital was rearranged and a
teak deck was laid; all weather exposed
d^cks were relaid with teak; a baker's
j shop was built on the main deck; the re
frigerating chambers were entirely re
built; a butcher's shop and Ice house
were provided on the main deck, while an
i entire new electric plant was installed:
lavatories and bath rooms have been fixed
up with porcelain basins instead of the
old enameled ones, and all in all the
Sheridan can now be classed as "the fin
est transport afloat "
It was originally the intention of the
Government- to have the changes to the
transport fleet made in Hongkong, where
teak can be obtained at a low figure and
coolie labor is cheap. Captain Batchelder,
Captain Barneson and Captain Mathews,
backed by Colonel Lyong, set their faces
against the scheme, however, and the re
sult Is the expenditure of a large sum of
money In necessary alterations, in San
Francisco.
The Sheridan took away yesterday
about forty ladlos, relatives oÂ£ olllcers.
and about 400 recruits, besides a. number
of men for the hospital "staff.
The Log^n landed her sick and wounded
at the Presid'.o yesterday and later took
the Sheridan's berth at Folsom-street
wharf.

TUTUILA. Samoa. Nov. 1.â The Com
mandpnt. Governor B. F. Tilley. has been
and is paying an official visit to all the
leading districts and towns prior to his
departure for New Zealand on the Ab
trenda. The Samoa ns everywhere speak
praisingly of the benefits they now realize
through the cession to the United States
of the Island of TutuIIa. To a large ex
tent thiB is due to the careful considera
tion and fair treatment always displayed
by Governor Tilley toward the people.
The Abarenda sails for New Zealand
about November 25 and during the ab
sence of Governor Tilley, Lieutenant
Commander E. J. Dorn will be Deputy
Governor.
The Governor, during his trip, was ac
companied by District Judge E. W. Gurr,
who. in conjunction with the native Dis
trict Judges has had a large number or
cases to settle, including a number of
appeals from the native Magistrates'
Courts Governor Tiliey. as president of
the High Court of Tutuila, has given two
important decisions in divorce matters
which will have the tendency to correct
the loose Ideas of marriage now held by
the Samoans.
The native officials are doing good work,
but so far without pay. The time Is not
opportune for demandtng taxes from the
natives for revenue purposes. At the
present time they are overloaded with
debt, created by past contracts for the
building of churches and boats, and in
overzeaiously making subscriptions to the
mission society which appear to be out of
proportion to their earning powers. It
will probably fcc necessary for the Gov
ernment to regulate those matters so as
to prevent the Samoans entering into un
necessary and improvident agreements.
In the meantime Governor Tilley is em
barrassed financially, as no appropriation
has been made by the United States Gov
ernment for the government of the na
tives. To put the natives in the way of
self-governing with some stability re
quires at the start some financial aid, and
this has not been given in Tutuila.
The German Government in German Sa
moa is dealing with the people under their
control as liberally as possible, and some
of the chiefs are under direct pay from
the imperial German Government. In
TutuIIa there If not one native official re
ceiving remuneration from the United
States Government for his services.

NEW YORK, Nov. 16.-Among the
American scouts and Irish cavalrymen
Just arrived in this country after service
In the Boer army are Private T. A. Bel
ford of Ireland and J. N. King of Cali
fornia, better known as "Dynamite
Dick."
"We are all members." said Belford, "of
the Irish Brigade, which was commanded
by an Americanâ Colonel 'Johnny' Blake,
formerly of the Sixth United States Cav
alry and a West Point graduate. This
war is not nearly over, notwithstanding
reports to the contrary. Read the re
ported losses of the English, which they
say in their dispatches are due to 'enteric'
fever. It is not the enteric fever or any
other kind of enteric affection that is do
ing the work. It Is Mauser bullets and
nothing else.
"We were In the field from October 6,
1S9S, to the second day of last month, then
we sailed from Lourenzo Marques for
Trieste, en route to America. We were
at Spion Kop, Oolenso, the siege of; Lady
smith, Modderspruitt, besides many other
engagements. As regards ; marksman
ship, especially with small arms, the
Boers can give the English cards and
spades and still beat them with their eyes
shut. During a fight on October 30 500
Johannesburg policemen fought 1500 in
trenched English, capturing their works
with 1178 men and killed the rest. This
gives an idea of how the Boers can shoot.
"It sounds strange, but It Is trueâ I
never saw a Union Jack or a regimental
flag during all the war. The only flag
the British ever showed was a white one
and I never heard of a white Union Jack
"When the poor old President left for
Europe General Botha, In his order to hla
men announcing the departure, said: 'Now
that the poor old man is safe, let the
fighting begin.' This was the inaugura
tion of guerilla warfare. The English of
ficers are a queer set. French is the best
of the lot. Buller is the bulldog of the
crowd. He has no feeling for his men.
On one occasion a detachment of troops
in his command refused to storm a Boer
stronghold, to face which was certain
death/ In his anger Buller turned a bat
tery of artillery on them and seventy
three of them were killed."
"Dynamite Dick" King said the scouts
had an experience similar to the Irishmen
in most cases, one of their duties having
been to dynamite the railwavs. His par
ticipation in this duty, he. said, accounted
for his sobriquet. He said that the de
tachment was discourteously treated by
the authorities at Lourenzo Marques the
Portuguese having imprisoned them for
six days on a troopship before allowing
them to board the Austrian-Lloyd steam
ship Styra. on which they sailed for
Trieste. . .

"DR." AH SUE DIES.
STOCKTON, Nov. 16.â Testimony in the
Williams murder trial to-day proved to
be the most sensational so far brought
out Mrs. W. J. Martin, widow of the
murdered conductor, and Mrs. Stella Wil
liams, the divorced wife of the defendant,
were on the stand. â¢
Two letters, which were Identified as
having been written by Captain Williams
to Mrs. Martin in 1896, were produced and
read to the Jury. In one of the Ietter3,
"Williams stated that the conductor, whom
he subsequently shot, had ruined his
home. Mrs. Stella Williams was at that
time the wife of Captain Williams.
Mrs. Stella Williams gave damaging
testimony against her former husband.
Her attitude on the stand was defiant.
During: the time she was being questioned.
Captain Williams sat leaning far over the
table toward her, eying her face In
tently. She testified that while she and
Martin were walking together on the
evening of the shooting she noticed Cap
tain Williams following them.
Mrs. Wycoff. who lived in the Williams
household while Mrs. Stella Williams was
the wife of the defendant, testified to
day that in May, 1896, -Williams, while in
a rage one day, threatened to kill Martin,
who, he said, had been carrying tales of
his (Williams 4 ) doings to Mrs. Williams.
The witness said she heard the defendant
repeat the threats on several subsequent
occasions.
On cross examination, the character of
Mrs. Stella Williams was strenuously at
tacked by defense. She waa asked if she
had not spent a night with the murdered
man in San Francisco. The court finally
ordered counsel for thÂ« defense to cease
this line of questioning. Mrs. Williams
denied that at thÂ© time of the shooting
she was particularly unfriendly to the de
fendant. .
The prosecution closed its case late this
afternoon. The defense asked for a con
tinuance until Monday morning. This
was denied by the court, which ordered
that the trial go on without delay.

TJNEXPECTED DISCHARGE ,
OF RUSSELL HARRISON
Ordered Without His Bequest or Con-
saltation With His Immediate
Superior.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 18.â Much sur
prise Is expressed by friends of Lieutenant
Colonel Russell B. Harrison, son of for
mer President Harrison, at the Issuance
of an order by the War Department a few
days ago honorably discharging him from
the volunteer army.
Lieutenant Colonel Harrison, It Is as-
Farted, will probably feel as much sur
prised as any of his friends, as It was
learned to-day that his discharge was or
dered without consultation with Brigadier
General Breckinridge. Inspector general,
his Immediate superior, or, so far as can
be ascertained, upon any application made
by himself. That he did not expect to
retire from the army bo Boon Is shown
by the fact that only a few days ago his
â¢wife went to San Juan Puerto Rico, ex
pecting to remain with her husband dur
ing the winter months.

CALL BUREAU. WELLINGTON HO
TEL. -WASHINGTON. Nov. 16. â A
new and rather sensational phase o*
the question whether the field gun with
which the United States army is to be
equipped is of native invention or based
upon knowledge obtained' of thÂ» new
French field gun was developed here to
day.
Officials of the State Department em
phatically denied that General Porter or
any of his subordinates had anything
whatever to do with acquiring the secret
of the gun.
It was stated that the Information was
obtained by an officer who visited FVance
last summer; that It was not purchased
or stolen, but that his technical knowl
edge enabled him, after an examination
of the gun, to draw the plan of its con
struction.
The report that General Porter Is to bÂ«
recaJled and Minister Leischman trans
ferred to Paris is said to be ridiculous.
Genera! Porter is expected to remain in
Paris unless Mr. Root should retire. In
â¢whirh event he may come to Washington.
a.c Secretary of War.
Lieutenant General Miles preserves al
ienee when questioned regarding the in
vestigation he has begun, and Brigadier
General Buffington. Chief of Ordance,
who was called upon for a statement as
to whether he or any of his officers made
the information public, also declines to
discus the matter.
A foreign military attache said to-day
he wa* satisfied that no one attached to
the embassy obtained the information.
"There is a line." lit continued, "be
yond which an attache cannot go. It is
Â¦well known, however, that every country
has agents in every other state. I make
the assertion tr>at any secret of any Eu
ropean army can be purchased for a rea
sonable sum. There are plenty of people
in Europe who will get the information
you desire, provided you pav enouct
for it.
"Though France regards her gen
mechar.ifm as a great secret. I have no
<5oubt that the War Offices of Germany.
Italy. Austria. Russia and Great Britain
know all about it. but have not adopted
it, Flmply because they believe they have

given in that behalf by this committee, and

employes of the hospital amertlnsT the existence
of said adulteration.
It Is the opinion of your committee that the
charges of adulteration made against said com
missary are not sustained by the evidence in
troduced. The evidence offered waa faulty, un
reliable and Insufficient, and not only failed
to establlsn any adulteration by the commis
sary, but was also of such indefinite character
that your committee was unable to trace culpa
bility for any asserted adulteration. It It
therefore recommended that the charges against
said- commissary be dismissed.
In the opinion of your committee the evidence
established incompetence, both mental and
[hycical, of the employs Richard* and the im
proper motive* of the employe Louis Loo, and
your committee respectfully recommenda their
discharge. **"Â¦ ve *
Your committee respectfully reoommends that
the commissary. Mr. Maguire. having been ex
onerated, should be reinstated in his said po
c'.tior. without any deduction from his salary
for lost of time pending bis suspension.

Maguire is restored to his position as
commissary. Louis Loo, the head cook,
and D. Richards, a former patient but
now a ward tender, were discharged from
their positions for falsely swearing that
Maguire had given them orders to water
the milk. The report says:
SuBsdorff was subjected to considerable
uncomfortable cross-questioning during
the trial by Attorney Matt Sullivan, but
the wor^t that Maguire could bring
against Sussdorff was that the latter
loved sparrows and hated cats.
Maguire experienced a change of heart,
however, on being assured that he would
be restored to his position, from which he
had been temporarily removed by Suss
dorff. If he (Maguire) would promise to
ke*p his mouth closed.
As -was expected, the Health Board's
investigation into the charge brought by
Superintendent Physician G. E. Sussdorf
of the City and County Hospital against
Commissary Maguire, that the latter had
watered the milk used in the Institution,
resulted in a complete exoneration for
Maguire. The. report of the Hospital Com

LEE C. DUFF, the freshman foot- I
bell player who was injured in a
game about the first of this
month. Is not dead, as was re
pcrted in the evening papers yes
terday. He was rerrioved from an Oak
land hospital to his home on Bowditch
street. Berkeley, last evening. The young
man's condition is about the fame, very
little improvement being noticed.
The young man's Injury was In the
pp!ri<"Â». causing paralysis of the lower half
rf his body. He suffers excruciatlr.g pain
f.t times and has to be placed under the
influence of opiates. Although the best
of medical attendance has been given him
and several Fpecialists have been con-
suited, his case seems to be beyond help.
A large room has been prepared for him
at his home in order to give him every
comfort possible.
The cage is a remarkable one. It was
four days after he was injured before he
became paralyzed; The second day after
he had been hurt he attended the Cali
fornia-Stanford freshman football game
as Eubstltute center. At that time he
said he was not feeling well, but the seri
ous nature of his case was not dreamed
of.
A widely circulated report of the In
jured player's death to-day caused much
anxious Inquiry from friends'. Dr. J. 8.
Eastman, the attending physician, said
that although paralyzed there was no
cause for fear of death. His condition at
present was hopeful.
Scarcely had Mrs. Strickland left the
Morgue when an elderly woman, with
snowy white hair, arrived. She waÂ« la
boring under great excitement and asked
appeallngly for Mrs. Strickland. When
told that Mrs. Strickland had gone sha
said that she must Â£ee herâ it was a
case of life or death. She asked the dep
uty who was on duty to tell Mrs. Strick
land, If she should return, that "Colum
bia's mother" had asked for her.
"Colombia's mother â and "Columbia ?
who could that mysterious person be? As
the day grew older the mystery deepened.
The gmy-haired. feeble, excited old lady
had left," refusing to give her name. Mrs.
Strickland would know who Columbia
was. Those who knew Haraszthy well at
once scented a romance. With his repu
tation as a gay blade and the cumulative
evidence held in the romantic nÂ«ystery of
that name Columbia, those of his frienJs
who eaw the gayer side of-his life wero
prepared to believe whatever startling
disclosures might be made in the way of
entangled heartstrings. . .
The grief-stricken, excited old lady,
"Columbia's mother," It was learned last
night, was Mrs. J. H. von Schmidt, who
lives at 1612 Washington street. "Co
lumbia" is none other than her daugh
ter. Miss Columbia \J. von Schmidt, who
was formerly a stenographer In Har
aszthy's office. " .
Haraszthy spent the laBt hours of n!Â»
life with the Von Schmidts, ne had toM
other friends that he was going to dine
with friends and expected to be home
early, but It was midnight when he was
found lying on the sidewalk but little
more than a block from the Von Schmidt
home. He had evidently been intending
to take a Hyde-street car and was prob
ably waiting at the corner, his umbrella
raised to protect him from the driving
rain, when he was stricken down by" the
fatal heart disease. He was still breath
ing when passengers on a Hyde-street car
saw him and went to his aid, which must
have" been soon after he had sunk uncon
scious upon the sidewalk. Death over
took him before the ambulance reached
the Receiving Hospital.
Mrs. von Schmidt refused last night to
be Interviewed regarding Haraszthy's re
lations to members of her family. She ad
mitted, speaking from an upstairs win
dow, that Haraszthy had spent the even-
Ing with them. She said:
"He' was an intimate friend of our fam
ily and called often. He waa here Thurs
day night and we were all together In the
parlor. I do not remember what time he
"My daughter Columbia? She has been
very sick and is not able to see you. We
all feel very much broken up by Mr.
Haraszthy's sad death."
At this moment Miss Columbia appeared
at the window herself and leaning out
until the mass of brown hair crowning
Haraszthy's body wan identified early
yesterday morning and soon after It be
came known for a certainty who the deal
man was, his daughter, Mrs. George D.
Strickland, reached the Morgue. Her
grief was intense, the more 80 becaube
her father had met death under, such
distressing circumstances.
ARPAD HARASZTHY, manufac
turer of California champagnt,
scion of a noble Hungarian family,
and known among bohemians as
a bon vivant and prince of good
fellows, was found dying on the sidewalk
at the corner of Hyde and Washington
streets shortly before 1 o'clock yesterday
morning. Scarcely nad his body been
identified at the Morgue when incidents
occurred which point to a romance,
hedged about with mystery, that possibly
brightened his old age and made his life's
December seem but May.
Then Metson told of the finding of the
two orders In which Judge Noyes set
forth he had no further Jurisdiction in the
eas^s, orders to which Metson had - re
ferred in his previous testimony. He
said he found the orders slipped into the
record, with no file mark upon them and
no one knew where they had come from.
Metson was Just going on to tell how
Frost, the special agent of the Treasury
spent his time and that of his assistants
In gathering evidence for the McKenzle
plaintiffs and watching the defendants,
when the adjournment hour came Â¦ and
the case went over until this morning.
The first news that the court was work-
Ing was conveyed to the mine-owners
when they were told their mine was In
the hands of a receiver. It would be in
teresting to know what would have hap
pened had Judge Noyes decided to hurry.
Then later on an injunction was granted
to restrain the defendants from working
the mine, and it was not until three weeks
later that the application for the injunc
tion was filed- This piece of legal fore
casting was done by Archie Wheeler, the
court reporter, who practiced law in his
leisure momenta. And still later. In a fit
of charity, the court made an order ap
pointing Wheeler court stenographer at a
salary of $30)0 a year. The appointment
was made to date from July L Wheeler
arrived at Nome on July 21 and the order
itself was not made out until the middle
of September.
Metson waa not satisfied with the small
bond of the receiver, and he appeared be
fore Judge Noyes to ask that it be In
creased. His request was refused, and
the court took occasion to lecture the city
attorney on the many great virtues of the
receiver.' Judge Noyes said McKenzie was
a man of sterling integrity and in this
case there was no necessity for a bond
at all. When Metson got to know him
better the Judge- added, he would recog
nize McKenzle's trua worth. But Metson
and the defendants had already discov
ered the true worth of the receiver. He
Â¦was running the mine In a most extrava
gant fashion, and In his hurry to get the
gold out he was skimming over the poorer
ground and was taking only that which.
was richest. â¢ But that was only hiB worth
as a miner. . . " . , â¢
Some of the philosophy of McKehzie
was also given place in the record. It
seems he told Chipps that the idea was
to get the claim into litigation and then
let the owner appeal, but in the meantime
he could get ail the gold out.
"You understood, then, that you would
get a favorable decision?" asked Pills
bury.
"Yes, I suppose I did. McKenzle said
he could get a favorable decision, turn
the gold over to the plaintiff and let him
get out of the country with It."
To offset this Attorney Geary brought
out the fact that the case was to be tried
before a Jury, to offset which Pillsbury
again brought out the fact that the panel
of Jurors which waa to try the case waa
made up of Soapy Smith's gang, and that
there was more chance of them doing the
right thing for McKenzle than for the
court to do so. There seemed to be no
loophole nor opening of any kind that
was not stopped by some one belonging
to the company or owned by McKenzle.
Metson's story of the way the court ran
Its affairs was another revelation in
northern Justice, Its fountain was of the
prophetic order and it saw and filled the
want even before the courtesy was re
quested. The court arrived at Nome on
Saturday. July 2L Judge Noyea told
Judge Johnson, one of the defendant's at
torneys, that be was not going to hurry;
that he would probably record his com
mission in St. Michael before he opened
court and that would take nearly a week.
On Monday, July 23. he appointed Mc-
Kenzie receiver in charge of six mining
properties and It was six hours after the
appointment that the papers in the suits
in which he was suppoeed to have been
appointed were filed. When McKenzie
pot his appointment he posted out to the
Discovery, the richest In the bunch, and
took possession.
Another Interesting bit of information
was contained in Chipps' description of
how the company palmed off a lot of ma
chinery it had found not suitable on one
of Its receivers in the Topkok district.
The machinery had been purchased by the
company for use on the claims It had
wrested from the miners who were work-
Ins the beach. It was found of but little
use, however, and the matter of a receiver
for the Topkok mine being under consid
eration the machinery was loaded on
barges to await the appointment. When
the appointment was made the Ink was
r.ot dry before the barges were on their
way to Topkok. It was found that the
machinery could not be sold without ac
tion by the board of directors of the com
pany, so McKenzlÂ© called the only di
rectors' meeting there is In the history of
the company. Chipps was at the meeting,
but as it waa only a formality anyway ho
did not pay enough attention to learn
what price was paid. "I knew It was a
good sale, though," said Chipps. Whatever
the price, it waa paid out of the proceeds
of the mine, and it must have been a good
one, for it is understood that the price
squeezed from the mine was more than
the machinery cost In the first . place.
Cameron, one of McKenzle's friends, waa
then receiver of the Topkok mine.
Metson gave some more testimony of
the same kind on the Blake suit. It was
a good deal of a surprise to the reputable
lawyers in Nome, he said, how attorneys
could prosecute two claims against the
Fame piece of property, each claim diamet
rically opposite to the other and each tend
ing to destroy the other title should It pre
vail. The plaintiffs were bound to get hold
of the claim anyhow.
"No, not if 1 won first. If I won, he
couldn't get it from me." was the way
Chipps figured on the situation.
"Yes, I rather think It was," said the
crestfallen Chipps.
"Wasn't it a blackmailing claim brought
by your attorneys. Hubbard, Beeman &
Hume, po that if the mine owners should
be proved to have been naturalized the
Blake suit could go right on?"
"Yes."
"And If it prevailed wouldn't it have de
stroyed your title?"
"Wasn't the suit brought as a cudgel to
whip the owners of the claim Into a com
promise? Wasn't it brought so that If in
case you slipped up on any of your own
proceedings you would have something
else to fall back upon?" pursued Pills
bury-
"Yes, they were my 1 attorneys," an
swered the witness; "but they told me It
would be all right."
"You loaned >qur attorneys to Blake to
bring a suit hostile to you?" was the way
Pillsbury summed it up in a question to
Chipps. .
The most Interesting part of the day's
proceedings was the description of the
Blake euit by Chipps and by Metson. The
euit was brought against the owners of
the Discovery claim, on Anvil Creek, as
coon as it was known that the owners ot
Discovery could produce proofs of citizen
ship. Chipps' tuit rested mainly on the
contention that they were foreigners and
were therefore not entitled to hold land.
Blake's claim was that he had grubstaked
the three partners and was therefore en
titled to a large interest in their claim.
Had Blake's claim prevailed there would
have been an end to the Chipps claim,
and had Chipps' contention proved suc
cessful Blake would be nowhere. The
suits were as opposite in Interest as two
suits well could be, yet thev were both
brought by the same lawyersâ Hubbard,
Beeman & Hume. *
The somewhat agile justice dispensed in
the court of Nome and some of the meth
ods that characterized It were the burden
of the testimony taken in the Dubois con
tempt matter before' Commissioner Hea
cock yesterday. There were two wit
nesses under examination, Robert Chipps,
who has left the stand for good so far as
the preliminary examination is concerned,
and W. H. Metson. the attorney, who is
still under examination. ,

her head touched and whitened still more
by contrast the silky, snowy locks of her
mother, she asserted with suppressed ex
citement that they knew nothing of Mr.
Haraszthy. Then her mother forced her
back from the window and explained
again to the reporter that her daughter
was too ill for even a word by way of
interview.
"I made a very foolish mistake." Mrs.
X~on Schmidt said, "when I mentioned her
name at Â¦ the Morgue this morning. . I
was unstrung by grief or I never should
have made such a mistake..
"My daughter Columbia engaged to Mr.
Haraszthy? Well, you can set that rumor
right. No, there was no thought of any
such thing between them. He was just
a good friend of our family."
And Mrs. Von Schmidt withdrew from
view, closed the window- and pulled tl-e
blind down.
Mrs. Strickland, the daughter of the
deceased, was seen by The Call reporter
at the home of her aunt, Mrs. Michael
Flood. 723 Polk street. She admitted
knowing the identity of the woman who
had asked for her at the Morgue, but re
fused at first to give her name. She said
that the anxious inquirer was an oli
friend of the family and that the daugh
ter Columbia and she were very dear
friends. Later she gave Mrs. Von
Schmidt's name, but said she knew noth
ing of the family and believed that Col
umbia had married since the time when
she was employed as a typewriter In her
father's office.
"I will say this much," Mrs. Strickland
volunteered. "My father had no entangle
ments with any woman. He was a wid
ower and was not engaged. His estate
is not so big that there need â¢ be any fear
of efforts to prove claims to It by any
but his recognized heirs."
Arpad Haraszthy was a generous soul â
too generous for his own good â a high
liver and possessed of a keen sense of en
joyment of life's pleasures. He was one
of the six charter members of the Bohe
mian Club and It was he who proposed
George T. Bromley for membership and
secured his election. On all matters con
nected with the growing of wine grapes
and the making of wines Mr. Haraszthy
was an expert and took pleasure in im
parting to others the valuable results of
his observations, reading and experience.
Wine making was not his only fad. He
loved a good dinner washed down with his
own champagne, a bit of opera and
above all a pretty woman, for he had all
the gallantry of the typical Frenchman.
In his office on Washington street he had
rigged a hammock and a white canvas
screen as background for his work In
amateur photography, his lady visitors, of
whom there were many, being the sub
jects of his camera. In that room was
consumed much sparkling champagne
that was never paid for by the people who
drank it.
The social side of his nature was un
duly developed, however, and he was far
from being a "hustler" In business. For
that reason his profits and sales were not
as large as they should have been consid
ering the low prices at which he placed
his champagne on the market. His gen
erosity led him Into acts of financial im
prudence, and his eagerness to assist his
friends with his signature made large in
roads upon his income. Last spring he
went to Nome with his brother, Bela
Haraszthy, an expert miner, in the hope
of .replenishing- his wealth. The life in
Alaska did not agree with him. Coarse
food and other hardships of mining camp
life told upon his health. He returned
from Alaska only last Wednesday, being
a passenger on the steamer Kimball. He
brought with him a number of nuggets
and reported to his family and friends
that he had located a number of claims
which he had reason to believe were rich
enough In the yellow metal to make him
a wealthy man when next summer should
bring the opportunity to work them.
During his six months' absence his
champagne business was conducted by his
daughter, Mrs. George D. Strickland,
widow of a naval officer. Her mother
was Miss Jovita Vallejo, the beautiful
daughter of General Guadalupe Mariano
Vallejo. The mother died years ago. Mrs.
Strickland and Carlos Haraszthy were the
offspring of the union. Carlos Is now en
gaged In business In Tahiti.
Arpad Haraazthy had an ancestry of which
any man might Justly be proud. He was born
in Hungary in 1S40. His father was Count
Agoston Haraszthy, the Intimate friend of
Kossuth. The discovery of & plot in which he
wan associated with Kossuth for the liberation
of Hungary forced him to flee for his life. He
came to America, and later by the intercession
of our Government Austria consented to let
him return to Hungary and bring his family
out to the New World. After living for a time
in New York he came across the plains to Cali
fornia, and some years after he planted a vine
yard in 8onoma County and became one of the
pioneer vltlculturists of California. He diet!
in Nicaragua.
The gTeat-gcrandfather of Arpad Haraszthy
was Viceroy to the King of Dalmatla.
Arpad Haraszthy. while still a young man,
made a careful study of the wine-making in
dustry and spent months in France and along
the Rhine for that purpose. He became Im
bued with the idea that California was an
ideal place for the manufacture of champagne,
and on his return to the State in 1S62 he in
vested many thousands of dollar* la that en
terprise.
Mrs. Ida Hancock of La Bruyere rancho.

moved yesterday afternoon to the Flood

Of all the diseases knowra with which the female organism is afflicted, kidney
disease is the most fatal. In fact, unless early and correct treatment is ap-
plied, the weary patient seldom survives.
Being fully aware of this, Mrs. Pinkham, early in her career, gave ex-
'i\ustive study to the subject, and in producing' her great remedy for woman's
fls â Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound â was careful to see that it
contained the correct combination of herbs which was sure to control that
fatal disease, woman's kidney troubles. The Vegetable Compound acts in har-
mony with the laws that govern the entire female system, and while there
are many 6O called remedies for kidney troubles, Lydia E. Pinkham's Veg^
table Compound is the only one especially prepared for women.

taking your medicine a more miser-

not eat or sleep, and did not care to
talk with any one. I did not enjoy
life at all. JÂ»ow, I feel so well I can-
not be grateful enough for what you
have done for me. You are surely a
woman's friend. Thanking you a
thousand times, I remain,
Ever yours

The stock market's activity has been on a
falling scale this week, and the transactions,
though still very large, have lost the marks
of an excited speculative spirit which pre
vailed after the election. On Monday last the
transactions at the Xew Tork Stock Exchange
rose to 1,700,000 shares, an unprecedented figure,
but for the first time since Wednesday. Xovem
ber 7, it was evident that the selling wan
greater than the buying. The profit-taking was
the main cause for the outpouring of stocks,
though the professionals were tm some extent
sellers for short account. The Industrials,
which at the close of last week had begun to
take the lead and show the large rises, were the
chief sufferers, their decline being accelerated
by the fact that rats of Interest for money as
sumed a ] harder tone, particularly | where I In
dustrial stock figured to any extent as collat
eral. The firmness of money, in fact, seemed
to Influence the entire stock list, and the realiz
ing eales were on a much larger scale, while
the buying power was materially reduced, ex
cept at concessions. The largest recession en
Monday afternoon and Tuesday were In the
Industrials, but there were no very serious
drops save in the case cf the American Lln
seed Company stocks, which were affected by
preliminary advances. The railroad list felt
the effect of profit-taking for a time, and prices
were generally somewhat lower, although at the
depression very good buying was seen, and the
standard railroad stocks, after holding their
ground at the slightly lower level, became
stron- again and tended to advance under the
lead cf Pennsylvania, Northern Pacific and
ether prominent favorites. In these movements
rumors of pending deals, auch as one of a
possible acquisition of Jersey Central by the
Pennsylvania and other^trunk line > interests,
played a leadinz part. The dissolution of the
Northern Pacific voting trust wu accompanied
fcy reports that a combination of some kind
with the Great Xorthern was In prospect. The
reports were denied, but there was large buy-
Ing of the Northern Pacifies for London, with
which center the disposition since the election
had been to sell Americans, but in the latter
part of this week, the foreign" purchases of
stocks have rather exceeded the sales. ,.Â¦: The
renewed strength of the railroad list also af
fected the Industrials, but the Improvement In
that division was on a more restricted scale,
the . activity being confined to a few leading
Issues, of â¢ which Tennessee Coal was the most
conspicuous.

Family Retail Market.
Packer hides at Chicago have ceased to ad
vance, but remain firm at top figures and coun
try hides made further gains. Tanners are not
buying eagerly, and offerings are also moder
ate. Leather quotations are only slightly al
tered, while seven grades are steady at former
figures. Belting butts have advanced sharply.
A temporary flurry In the wheat market on
Monday took the December option above 80c.
It was reported that Wall street operators were
turning their attention to grain. PubUcation of
the usual weekly statistics had a depressing
effect, however, particularly the enormous ex
ports from Russia, which were a contradiction
of earlier statements that the crop was short
in Northern Europe. Liverpool selling was large
and the realizing soon made a decline of over
2c, which exceeded the previous advance. The
much-discussed advance in meats at Chicago
was not heavy, but scarcity of first quality
fresh eggs has brought very high prices.
Failures for the week in the United States
were 217, against 219 last year, and 33 In Can
ada, against 20 last year.
Prices of commodities advanced almost without
exception and all the changes in manufactured
goods are in the direction of firmer quotations.
The smallness of stocks of goods carried is a
feature of our reports from most of the lead-
Ing centers. Scarcity of labor gives manufac
turers In the Middle States great concern. Ac
tivity at Cincinnati and steel mills steadily In
creases, and there Is an equally uniform ad
vance on the quotations.
The gain has been more general this week
than at any previous time this season, plglron
moving up 25c a ton and corresponding gains
appearing In billets, plates and structural ma
terial generally. Instead of the recent agita
tion for cheaper steel rails, there is now talk
of an advance to $28, owing to the further rise
in steel billeta. Orders come forward in the
best volume since last spring, when there was
severe Inflation of prices, and requests for quick
delivery are general. The report of pigiron
production on Xovember 1, by the Iron Age,
shows a weekly capacity of only 215,304 tons,
the smallest since September, 1S98. but the re
duction of 29,000 tons from October 1 In fur
nace stocks is most encouraging. The figures,
with the activity in all branches of tha indus
try, indicate that there will be no further re
duction in output, but the December statement
will probably show more than 200 furnaces in
blast.

2000 tons; one from Swans>a. 1137 tons; total.
44.567 tons. Last week's deliveries wÂ«re only
ID. 470 tons, hence we were sadly in need of
the genercus arrivals this week, which regu
late, our reqnirerr.tr.t3 to date. The actual
amount absolutely called for approximates to
30.000 tons weekly. Of course there are cer
tain months in the year where our needs call
for less, but this is about the average weekly

cargoes are becoming exceptional, and will

Views of President on Legislation
Which Has Been Suggested.
Washington; Nov. is.â The opinion is
gro-wing among public men who are In
the confidence of the President that ha
will oppose any movement looking to a re
duction of the Congressional representa
tion of the Southern States on account of
charges of the.disfranchisement of colored
\cters. The President is said to be- op
posed to reviving: ill feeling, which he
thinks would be the result of a bill thus
touching the South's suffrage.
On account of the President's attitude
there is a growing opinion that legislation
looking to the reduction of the Southern
representation will not be pressed by
P&rty leaders In Congress. In this con
nection It Is suggested that any action
taken with reference to the suffrage of
the South in advance of the adoption of.
a definite policy in the Philippines might
throw some embarrassment In the way oX
the proper disposition of the citizenship
rights of the Filipinos.
ROSEBERY'S FUTURE
AN IMPORTANT PROBLEM
Invitation to Lead Made With, tha
i Concurrence of the Leaders of
the Party.
LONDO>?. Nov. 16.â Lord Rosebery's
future is becoming an Important prob
lem, not only to Liberals, but In an al
most equal degree to the Conservative
party.
This morning the Dally Chronicle an
nounces that the invitation which Sir
Henry Campbell Bannerman. In his
speech at Dundee. Thursday, extended to
Lord Rosebery to resume the leadership
of the whole party, was made with the
concurrence of It9 principal members. "It
may be taken for granted," saya tho
Daily Chronicle, "that this will bÂ© put
In a shape still more formal and delib
erate before the February session of Parr
liament. If not Immediately, by the sum
moning of a meeting of the party for
this purpose, and that he will receive- an
invitation from a party practically unan
imous." Â¦- -
That the advent of such a virile per
sonality to the leadership of the Liberals
will not be welcome to the Conservative*,
who recognize that they have a difficult
task to face In Parliament, despite their
big majority, is reflected In their com
ments, or the comments of their organ*.
on Lord Rosebery' s rectorial address at
Glasgow yesterday.
The Standard and Morning Post both
point out that though Lord Rosebery fol
lows many others In indicating the diffi
culties confronting the nation, he has no
advice to offer as to the remedy. ThÂ»
Morning Post says: "The country teems
with men sharing Lord Rosebery s
doubts, and he gives them nothing but a
rehearsal of their misgivings."

Delia Schwartz, a comely youns woman,

STORM CAUSES ACCIDENT
TO CHINESE LATJNDRYMAN
Heavy Gate Falls' on Lee Ah Hi
and Breaks His
Leg.
The storm which broke over the city,
about 6:30 o'clock last night, was the
cause of one accident and the choking of
many powers, particularly in the Mission,
Western Addition and Hayes Valley dis
tricts. The sudden downpour, accom
panied by gusts of wind, made seas of
mud at the corners of all streets of any
grade, and made walking very disagree
able.
Lee Ah Hi was the one victim of the
cyclonic disturbance who was brought to
the Receiving Hospital. Officer Minehan
found him lying under a heavy stable gate
in the coal yard of Patrick Sullivan at
the corner of Octavia and McAllister
streets. The Chinese had driven in a
wagon belonging to the laundry at 414
Grove street, Â¦when the wind struck the
gate, knocked it off its hinges, pinning
him under It. He was found to have suf
fered a compound commlnated fracture
of the left leg, besides other minor in
juries. He was treated by Dr. McKlroy.
Complaints of all kinds were received
during the evening at the City Hail about
the choked condition of the sewers,
which were unable to carry off the volume
of sand that was washed from hillside and
pavement by the sudden fall of rain.
At Geary and Gough streets the tracks
of the Geary-street road were under
mined and the Board of Public Works
was notified to send men to repair tha
damage.
At McAllister and Market streets the
crossing was- flooded for some time, the
gewers being unable to carry off the body
of water caused by the great downpour.
Alleged Reason Is That the Arrivals
INSPECTOR SCHUYLER
LOSES" HIS OFFICE
of Chinese Have Fallen Off
Largely.
Chinese Inspector F. Schuyler was dis
missed from the Chinese Bureau yester
day In accordance with an order received
from the Secretary of the Treasury. Chief
Dunn has not yet returned from the East
and no one at the bureau was allowed to
assign any reason for the unexpected losÂ»
of Inspector Schuyler from the service.
Acting Collector Stanley Jackson said
yesterday that Mr. Schuyler's forced re
tirement was due to tt\e falling off In the
arrivals of Chinese since The Call eev
eral months ago exposed the nefarious
work of the coplie importers and their
allies. Â¦ A reduction of the force was
therefore deemed necessary and Mr.
Schuyler was selected as the unit of re
duction.
MAJOR HULL .RETURNS

McKINI/EY THE CHOICE
OF LOGAN'S PASSENGERS
Soldiers Hold an Election at Sea, and
the Republican Leader Wins
Out.
The first question asked by the return
ing soldiers on the transport Logan when
that vessel arrived In port was: "Who
was elected?" They had already settled
the matter as far as their own votes were
concerned, having on November 6 held an
election, which resulted In favor of re
turning McKinley to the White House by
a majority of thirty-three votes.
The ballot box was Improvised from an
empty meat case, and It was no trouble to
secure among the 296 voters men who
could write the ballots. Tellers, Inspec
tors and election clerks were appointed,
and tho passf-nger list served as a regis
ter. No stuffing was attempted, and "the
election proceeded quietly. When returns
were completed the vote showed McKm
iey thirty-three votes ahead. A separate
polling place was provided for the pris
oners, of which there were thirty-seven,
ajid Bryan was their favorite, receiving
six" votes more than McKlnloy.
When the soldiers were informed by tho
first visitors on the vessel that their votes
had been cast for the winner, there was
great rejoicing. â

A LAMBDA, Nov. 16.â Alameda lg
now firmly embraced in the
clutches of the trust octopus. Tes
terday the price of doughnuts
went up 60 per cent, and now It Is
announced that on the 1st of December
the price of shines will be Increased 100
per cent.
There are six bootblacks In Alameda.
and they have promulgated an edict that
those who want shines must pay double
the price heretofore charged. The com
pact was made to-day, signed, sealed and
delivered, and the man who breaks it will
have to pay a fine. Even the Croker ice
trust has not been. accused of doubling
prices, though it has been accused of
nearly everything else. If the young men
want their shoes shlned they must pay 10
cents, walk to Oakland to have it done for
& cents or try It themselves.
Ever since the formation of the dough
nut trust negotiations have been In pro
gress looking toward a bootblacks' com
bination. There are five natives of the
sunny southland and one of sunny Italy
In the business In Alameda. The five from
the southland were willing, but the one
from over the seas hesitated. At last he
signed, and now the people of Alameda
say that the deep, dark plot is complete.
The members of the combine are now
looking for big profits, and dividends will
be declared with wonderful frequency.
All of the stands are on Park street, and
the bootblacks have the business section
entirely In their control.
"Professor" Eugene Francis t*as thÂ»
leader In this movement, and he explain*
the situation thus:
"We shoe polishers gret little mornln*
trade here. What. we make In the fore
noon wouldn't pay for the matches and
toothpicks we u?e. The evening business
is what we depend on. When the boys
are goinsr to a dance or a party and. wajit
a shine right quick they have got to come
to us or do- their own shining. A fellow
can't shine at a ball right unless his shoes
look glossy. We will put the gloss on. but
it will cost 10 cents next month. Every
bootblack Is with us and our combination
can't be busted."
Here Is the document that binds the
bootblacks:

We. the underatgned. do hereby ajm-Â» to nUs<*
thr price of shining shoes from 5 cents to 19

Dr. M. L. Adams of Ballard, father of
the Miss Adams who accompanied Mls.Â«
Ingalls on her last visit to Mrs. Laurie,
says that two days prior to the girl's
death he purchased; arsenic for. Mrs.
Laurie. The Adams family and Mrs.
Laurie live in the same building. She
said that she intended using it for some
experiments in taxidermy.
The heart, liver, stomach, kidneys and
portions of the lungs, of the dead girl
were removed by the doctors and will
be the subjects of separate examinations.
The search is for arsenic and the reason Is
given in the assertion that Mrs. Laurie,
the woman under suspicion, purchased a
small quantity of arsenic two days b*fore
the girl's death.
Drs. Bories and Powers, who performed
tho autopsy, made a partial report to the
Coroner yesterday, but It was determined,
after a consultation with the Prosecut
ing Attorney's office, that no Jury should
be called until after a complete and
searching examination.

James P. Allen, whoÂ«e home is at 1334
Adeline street, within two doors of the
corner of Eighteenth, is the greatest suf
ferer by the storm. His residence is al
most- a wreck. The roof la torn oft and
the timbers were wrenched nnd the rain
leaks into every room. The plastering
was knocked off the walls in" great pieces.
Nearly all the upstairs furniture was
drenched by the rain that poured in and
peighbors were appealed to for assist
ance and bed clothing for the night.
Next door to Allen's resilience lives D.
C. Owens' family. The blinds of that
house are all torn off, together with a
portion of the. rear stairs. A portion of
the fence, built upon an embankment, is
down and several trees are uprooted.
The home of Mrs. Captain Miller, on 'the.
northeast corner of Eighteenth and Ade
line streets, suffered the loss of all the
shutters, which were blown several hun
dred feet down the street. The fence
which surrounded three sides of the house
Â¦was blown down and a lot of shrubbery
was ruined. A eucalyptus tree which was
in the rear yard was. torn up by the roots
and hurled across the street into a vacant
lot. A shed was leveled and fire came
near bein? added to the general destruc
tion by the blowing: over of a lamp in a
bedroom of the Miller home. One of the
ladies of the house saw It topple over In
time to seize it and throw it out through
the Â¦window.
The old De Fremery property, at the
southwest corner, was considerable dam
aged, though the full force of the cloud
burst did not seem to strike it. Two hun
dred feet of the fence was blown down on
the Adeline-street side- and much of the
trees and shrubbery was broken, torn up
by the roots and injured.
All the way along the block on Adeline
street, leading north from Eighteenth,
the fences are more or less damaged and
the small trees torn out of the ground.
The home of John P. Irish is among the
Injured.
During the storm the two-story brick
residence of Henry Meyer, on the north
west corner of Sixth and Broadway-, was
struck by a blinding flash of lipTitnlng
and the roof was nearly torn off. No one
was hurt.
Those whose property was destroyed bv
the cloudburst say it was over as qu'ckiy
as it came. AH agree that it could net
nave lasted more than a minute, aud th.Pi
!f it had continued a few moments longer
than it did very great damage would have
resulted. Tho Impact of the storm could
be felt by the Iftmates of the houses as
it struck from the southeast and whirled
around until it had completed the Circle
and then melted away. Just a few mo
ments before It bad been perfectly cairn
and there was not a suspicion that the
elements would break loose. The down
pour that came with the cloudburst flood
ed the streets and mude .walking almost
impoPFible for two hours after it had
cleared oft.

U1S Broadway, Nov. 16.
With fearful fore* a cloudburst, accom
panied by a small cyclone, broke shortly
after 7 o'clock to-night in the vicinity of
Eighteenth and Adeline streots. In the
upheaval that followed the roof of one
residence was completely blown ofT, fences
were razed, telegraph poles and wires
were pulled out of place, trees were taken
up by the roots and shrubbery of all kinds
was laid waste, and one big fence was
blown across the Seventh-street local
track, causing a short blockade of the
system.

Chief Sullivan has been convinced for
some days that Zlck Abrams, the pool
seller, has been selling pools, but he has
been unable to catch him In the act.
Yesterday he placed a blockade on
Abrams' poolrooms and will keep It up
until he eoes out of the business. Abrams
was one of thd poolmen who stipulated
with the Chief that he would not sell any
pools pending the decision of the Superior
Court on the appeal cases, and he is the

Musters, and a board of officers, and a
yell lrader in Milton Schwartz, who will
Facriflce his voice in the interests of his
college. The Rooters' Club has a uniform,
and has offered prizes for new yells and
has jrone into the business of making
rights hidoous at Berkeley while prepar
ing for the great and final effort on
Thanksgiving day. Regular drills and re

vere as that of the football team, whese
efforts th*Â»y expt*?t to cheer alone:.

of spectacular plans for the day of the

Harold and his wife, accompanied by H.
W. Wills and Mrs. Henrietta Krellng.
went to the concert hall on the night of
October 9. The women were talking while
one of the artists was singing, and were
asked to keep quiet. This request was re
sented by Harold, and after taking the
women to the Baldwin annex he and Wil
lis returned to the hall. Harold had a re
volver and he demanded satisfaction for
the alleged insult to his wife and lady
friend. During the altercation he shot
Haughen in th-3 left breast.
When the case was called yesterday aft
ernoon ex-Judge Ferral for the defendant
eald he was ready to proceed, but Assist
ant District Attorney Whiting said he
would be compelled tÂ» ask for a continu
ance, as the complaining witness, Haugh
en, was not present and the police had
been unable to find him. He asked for a
continuance, and the Judge put the case
over one -week. He Issued an attachment
for Haughen and made an order that no
bail should be acceptM for his release if
arrested. x
Haughen's peculiar conduct is a mystery.
He Informed Fischer three dayB ago thai
he would prosecute the case and would
be In court yesterday. Detective Dinan
went to Haughen's sister's house in Berke
ley, where he lived, Thursday, and she
told him that she had not seen her brother
for two days and did not know where he
was. Every effort* will be made by the
police to find him, as there Is only one
theory as to the cause of his disappear
ance.
Since Harold's arrest on the charge of
assault to murder several continuances of
the case have been granted by Judge Fritz
because Haughen was unable to appear
owing to his wound. A week ago when the
case was called Haughen was in court
and seemed anxious to proceed, but for
some . reason another continuance waa
granted until yesterday.
Brown Haughen, special officer in Fisch
er's concert hall, who was shot by Steuart
Harold/ alias Upshur. son-in-law of
"Lucky" Baldwin, on the night of Octo
ber 9, has mysteriously disappeared, j
Judge Fritz .Issues an Attachment for
Missing Han and Efforts Will
Be Made to Locate

to the heart of any man, the British ship
Sprlngbank finally docked at Union street
wharf yesterday. ShÂ© is 'down in the head
and leaking two inches an hour, but Cap
tain Boyd hopes to get her into a dry
dock In a day or bo. When It comes to
an overhauling, the underwriters expect
to find that almost the entire outside shell
of the ship below the water Una has been
torn away. ' :f./i
The Sprlngbank" went from Java to
Newcastle, N. S. W. After leaving Sura
baya the entire crew was taken down
with the "Java" fever and Captain Boyd
had a lively time.
After reaching Australia am. discharg
ing her cargo, the Springbank loaded for
San Francisco. When only a few days
out she ran into a hurricane off the coast
of Maitland and for twenty-four hours
was on her beam. ends. Next sne piled up
on Uslansky Island. Her bow was stove
In and nothing but her forward water
tight compartment saved her. . She was
kedged from one reef to another and on
every one of them left' a portion of her
hull. After losing the kedge anchor,
stream, anchor and '"best bower." she
was finally got into deep water. Then
the crew struck and refused to make sail.
Captain Boyd and his oflicers were equal
to the occasion, however, and the Spring
bank made port.
"The island of ' Lislansky is twenty
three miles out of place on the map,"
said Chief Officer James A. Brodie yester
day. "According to the chart it is in 25
dog. 55 mln. north latitude and 174 deg. 7
min. east longitude. We made halt a
dozen observations and each one showed
that Lislansky Island is in 26 deg. 3 mln.
north latitude and 173 deg. 43 mln. east
longitude. After the hamcane we had to
go along like a duck with a broken wing
and would have done tirst-rate had not
that mistake in the chart piled us up on
that coral reef.
"That was the toushest place I ever
struck. Captain Boyd sent me ashore
with a boatload of provisions in order to
; have something to eat If the ship should
slip off the rock and go down. We found
six Japanese there and every one of them
was as naked as the day he was born.
They were catching tea-fowl for their
feathers and bones. 'Â¦
"In all ray life I never saw a place so
crowded with sea-fowl. Why, you could
not move without stepping on one and
they would not get out-of your way. The
Japanese sit down In the midst of them
and pluck them alive. The plucked birds
are then thrown into a. heap to die. You
can imagine what the stench was like.
"There'are two large storehouses and a
couple of huts on the Island. In one of
the storehouses the feathers are kept and
in tho other the bones. The latter are
garnered after the birds have decomposed.
Day by day, week by week, month in and
month out the six Japanese sit and plucK
the feathers from live sea birds and then
throw the living bird aside with as little
compunction as you would have in shoo
ing a 6tray cur away from a full dinner
pall.
"The traders who control the island
send a boat once every six months from
Yokohama and the poor, unfortunate
devils who have been picking live birds
for half a year are taken home. Th^y
live on rice and sea turtle. The latter
was out of season when we were there,
but the Japanese sent us some of the
salted stuff. We could smell it before
the boat came alongside and we dumped
it overboard as soon as we got under
way.
"Preserve me from another encounter
with LJslansky Island. Once clear of the
reefs, the crew insisted on deserting an-i
taking up their quarters with the Jap
anese. The captain persuaded them how
ever, and we finally reached San Fran
cisco. -Not a man would live forward,
however, and during the entire run they
bunked under the break of the poop.
There was twenty feet of water In the
fore peak and the foremast was wobbly.
That was what scared the men."

CRUEL PRACTICE
OF COOLIES ON
LISIANSKY ISLE
The gamblers received the news of the
new order of affairs Â¦with much dissatis
faction, but realizing that their inter
ests are at stake some of them have re
luctantly made arrangements to comply.
Chief Sullivan aaya that visitors to
Chinatown have apparently become im
pressed with the Idea that nothing but
gambling houses exist within its bounda
ries. This impression Is gained because
of the numerous lights that adorn the
buildings, and the gaudy and fantastic
iltrures that have been painted on the
walls. - "*:*'.
By strictly enforcing these restrictions
Chief Sullivan hopes to put many of the
gambling dens out of existence. As the
space in the buildings above the ground
floor Is at present chiefly occupied by
lodging-houses it will bo difficult to find
space to accommodate sixty clubs and
even should they be located It is believed
they will not be so well patronized as
the ground floor quarters.
Not only will the gambling quarters be
moved skyward, but the elaborate display
of electric lights and gorgeous paintings
which adorn the clubs will be abolished,
feacft club will be permitted the use of
but one outside light and that at Its en
trance.
Chief of Police Sullivan Is taking a de
termined stand against the Chinese gam
blers. He Issued orders recently for a re
form In the Chinese quarter which will be
sweeping In its effects, and. the Chief hopea.
will ultimately grush the gaming traffic.
Each Chinese gambling-house proprietor
has received notice that he must move his
club above the ground floor of the build
ing It now occupies." There are sixty of
the clubs In existence at present and sixty
days Is given as a time limit In which the
new order must be complied with.
Gaming Apartments Must Be Above
the First Floor and All Elaborate
Electrical Displays Must
Be Abolished.
Extensive Changes Will Be
Made in Chinatown
by Police.

Wells-Fargo Company Gets Judgment
Against Cement Contractor on
a Definition. ; 4'L'[?;
United States Circuit Judge Morrow yes
terday rendered judgment in favor of the
plaintiff In the case of Wells, Fargo & Co.
vs. William Wolf. Suit was brought to re
cover from Wolf the difference on 2925
barrels of cement at J2 66 and at $3 60 per
barrel.*-
The * testimony showed that Wolf and
the plaintiff entered Into a contract for
the supplying of 5000 barrels of cement
"more or less" at $2 56 per barrel, to be
used In the construction of the company's
new building. As the work progressed
and when the 5000 barrels were consumed
It was found that 2925 barrels additional
would be required. By that time the mar
ket price of cement had risen to $3 50 per
barrel and Wolf declined to furnish more
than 500 additional barrels at the contract
price, claiming that that number of bar
rels, being 10 per cent of the number
named in the contract, complied with the
term "more or less" in the contract.
Judgment was given in favor of the
complainant for $2265, from which was to

LOSS OF WORK DRIVES

Alfred J. Goldman Becomes Discour
aged, Drinks to Excess and
Turns on the Gas.
Alfred J. Goldman, a weigher, occasion
ally employed by the Piper & Aden Com
pany at 24 Clay street, committed suicide
yesterday morning by asphyxiating him
self in his room at 2055 Ellis street
Goldman was a native of this city, 40
5'ears old, and unmarried. He resided
with his sister and widowed mother, aged
80 years, and his death gave his mother
such a severe shock that she is in a pre
carious condition.
At 7 o'clock yesterday morning Miss
Goldman noticed a strong odor of Illumi
nating gas in the house and traced it to
her brother's room. She opened the door
and found him unconscious. Dr. McDon
ald was called and spent two hours In a
fruitless effort at resuscitation.
Goldman had not had steady employ
ment recently and was despondent and
out of money. He went around the wa
ter front yesterday afternoon looking for
a job, and becoming disappointed, drank
excessively.
Another long conference was held yes
terday between Manager J. A. Fillmore
of the Southern Pacific and the delegates
from the Order of Railway Conductors
and Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen.
Besides the delegates, the meeting was
attended by E. C. Clark of Cedar Rapids.
Grand Chief Conductor, and W. G. Lee.
First Vice-Grand Master of the Railway
Trainmen. These two officials came at
the request of the delegates who were un
able to reach an amicable understanding
with Manager Fillmore at the meetings
held a week or two ago. The grand oltt
cers were called ti'pon as a final resort
on the part of the trainmen to persuade
the company to grant the concessions
asked.
Contrary, to expectations, the case of
the switchmen was not brought up at all
yesterday, nor is it likely to be considered
for several days. â¢ Neither Mr. Clark nor
Mr. Lee has anything lo do directly with
the switchmen, and whatever action than
body takes will be Independent of the
Brotherhood of Conductors and Railroad
Trainmen. Ordinarily this would not b';
the case, as the switchmen are supposed
to *iold membership in the trainmen's or
ganization. But the switchmen were le
fused permission to piesent, through the
delegates, a schedule of "their own. hence
they bolted the organization and must
now be heard independently.
It is the wish of Manager Fillmore that
the switchmen be given a separate con-
Elderatlon and this frank declaration Is
not altogether pleasing to the conductors
and trainmen, it is said. .
A greater part of yesterday's session
was given up to a discussion of the mer
its of the various items Included in the
revised schedule. " The moot important
Item, and one which the men are likely
to have the greatest trouble In getting
through, is In reference . to the amount
of mileage to constitute a month's work
by through freight crews and the basis
or computing overtime.
The present basis is the card time oJ
the train. The new proposition Is to fix
the basis according to the average num
ber of miles made per hour, a rule that
is followed by practically, all the big
roads in the country, except the Southern
Pacific. ;
If the concession is granted it will mean
that on some divisions men would per
form less mileage for their monthly pay

The Reverend Rabbi Nieto, speaking
from the pulpit of the Congregation
Sherith Israel last night, urged higher
education of women, who, he said,
were one of the molding forces of a na
tion.
"The question of woman in society,"
continued the speaker, "is not a new one.
It is old as man himself. The position
of woman in any society is necessarily
determined by the conditions in which
the lives. This is i roved by history
"The only true philosophy* is the
philosophy of necessity. The Old Testa
ment law that man should reign over
woman was- necessitated by the conditions
existent at that time.
"Where do we get most of that which
is kindly, noble, generous, in our lives?
feurcly not from man, who glories but in
his musclar power. It 1b the pure woman,
the good mother, the faithful wife who
supply life with these elements.
"The moral status of our society to-day
depends upon our women. It is. therefore,
very necessary to have our women high
ly educated that they may be able to act
ually strengthen and aid the race. We
mut-t judge v.oir.en as we judge menâ by
their jxjwer to absorb knowledge and to
impart Intelligently what they have
l*-arnt-d. Woman no longer is a poor,
vtak creature, seeking a helping hand;
she Is able now to leaxi forward in what
ever greÂ«t world work is to be done.
"The great freedom that women enjoy
tn this country is responsible for the noble
womanhood of this community."
The Reverend Rabbi Jacob Voorsanger
announced to the congregation assembled
in the Temple Emanu-El last night that
he <51d not intend, owing to the small size
of his audience, to Rive more than a brief
talk. He spoke of "Life's Failures." and
recited some verses of an anonymous poet
Â¦who has sung their cause. The preacher
Bpoke of the millions who are never heard
of. that a favored few may be honored.
"We are accustomed, all of us," he said.
"to clng the song of success. There are
very few ready to notice those who have
failed. We know the conquerors, the
great legislators, the great kings, but we
do not hear of those who have made them
great. Civilization is the chronicle not of
the few who succeeded but of the many
who failed."

There is not a great show for the chorus

think it must be very nice to play on

such music, isn't it, Mr. Damrosch? And
how very well you play! The clever con

demand for his appearance on the plat

was distinguished throughout by all its

iÂ«< a'sxeat epic of the elements, comln

"Der Flieger.de Hollander." As descrip

Fccrrt of the doomed wanderer. The
screaming winds shriek it, it whistles
thrrKigh the ship's rigging; the great dla

full of poetry and tenderness. As she
sinps the Dutchman theme, of which she

uncanny thrill, and when the Dutchman

tion.
Mr. Bispham was most enthusiastically
received last evening in his part of Der
Hollander. He paints a noble picture of
the unhappy captain, grand, gloomy, eter
nally wandering, and his big. rather un

Its musical interpretation. He was off key

Higher Price for Product Is Expected
to Follow a Rumored Combina
tion of Local Business
Interests.
It was a report last night that Henry
Cowell and Co. had bought out the
plant of the Cienega Lime Company,
which is near Tres Pinos, In San Benlto
County. Coupled with this was also a
story that a combination of Interests was
practically effected yesterday at a con
ference that took place In this city at
which II. T. Holmes of the H. T. Holmes
Lime Company, William Jones, William
Russell and H. T. Hawkins were present,
the purpose being to control all the lime
trade north of Tehachapi. William Jones
is associated with Henry Cowell & Co.
Hawkins Is the secretary' and Russell su
perintendent of the H. T. Holmes Lime
Company. At the office of Henry Cowell
& Co. the sale of the Ciengea Company
was denied. An admission was made that
there, was an important conference, but
it was denied that any result could be
looked for until next week. The. story of
the Cienega sale was accompanied with
so much detail, however, that It'ls prob
ably correct. The purchase by Cowell &
Co. would place all the lime kilns' north of
Tehachapi in the hands of Cowell and
Holmes. The last named has a plant at
Tehachapi and also half a dozen -or* so
lime deposits in Santa Cruz County. With
the exception Â¦ of the Holmes holdings,
Cowell has previously acquired all the
lime properties of the upper. end of the
State. , He fought : the Roche Harbor
Lime Companyiof Washington to a finish
In a war of rates and ended by securing
$35,000 of its stock out of a total of $100,000.
Since then he has competed with Holmes.
The Washington product and. that of the
southern part of. the State of California
has been kept out of this market. Prices
north and south have been much higher
than they have In this city. Lime has
been selling In Los Angeles at the rate of
$1 75 per 220 pounds or barrel. The rate
in San Francisco has ranged from $1 to
$1 26 per barrel, and two years ago, when
the fight was on with the Roche Harbor
Company, went as low as SO cents per
barrel.
The purpose . V the combine of the
Cowell and Hoimes Interests is supposed
to be an increase of prices. The South
ern California market Is controlled by the
Union Lime Company of Los Angeles and
that company handles the lime from the
Holmes plant at Tehachapi. There were
two versions of the bargain that Cowell
& Co. has made. â¢ The Cienega property
was reported to have been sold for $10,000
by the First National Bank of San Jose,
which secured It on a. mortgage of $90,000,
which, with accumulated interest, etc.,
amounted to $120,000. Cowell Is also sup
posed to have taken in the I X L lime plant
in Santa Cruz County, upon which there
were two mortgages, the flrst of which
was held by Leopold I. Cahn of this city.
However the details may differ, the
probabilities are for a deal by which com
petition will be done away with and that
Cowell will gain absolute control of the
market. Then the entire Pacific Coast
territory of the United States will be in
three lime districts, two of which will be
controlled directly by Â¦ Cowell. He has
been striving for years to accomplish this
and has probably succeeded.

Plan a Levee for Their
Benefit.
Deputy Sheriff Thomas V. Morrison of
Chicago arrived here yesterday to take
charge of Frank Bridl. alias Brady, the
noted crook, who was arrested in this city
several days ago through the efforts of
Captain of Detectives Seymour and his
men.
Bridl, or Brady, is well known through
out the country as a desperate fellow. The
particular crime for which he is wanted
Is the robbing of an old man named Pat
rick Flood in Chicago some time ago.
Flood went into a saloon to have a drink,
when he met a woman who Is known to
the Chicago police as Frankie Maxwell.
They left the saloon together, and when
a short distance from the place they were
met by Brldl, who was acquainted with
the woman. She whispered to him that
Flood had considerable money, and he Im
mediately planned to get possession of It.
The woman, following the instructions
of the crook, took her victim to a noto
rious resort In Chicago, where she claimed
6he had a friend who was anxious to see
her. As they were about to enter the
place Bridi appeared and knocked Flood
down, presumably with a "blackjack." As
he lay prostrate on the sidewalk Brldi
searched his pockets, taking all his money,
amounting to 1600. He and the woman
then left the scene without attracting at
tention.
Shortly after the robbery was commit-

More Property Recovered.
Detectives Ryan and O'Dea last night
recovered more of the property stolen by
Harry Eddo, the youthful crook who was
arrested Thursday In Los Angeles.
Yesterday the preliminary examination
of " Kddo was partly held in Judge Ca
baniss" court. â¢ He was not represented by
counsel and refused his privilege of hav
ing an attorney, appointed by the court.
As several important witnesses were ab

guilty.

H. E. Huntlngton, first vice president of
the Southern Pacific Railroad Company,
was asked yesterday if there was any
truth in the stories about the Standard
Oil people trying to gobble up all the oil
producing land in California. Reference
was made in The Call several days ago
to the large number of leases that have
lately been made to Individuals by the
Southern Pacific Company, and that re
cent developments indicated that at least
some of the land had been taken in the
interests of Mr. Rockefeller.
"Do I think there is anything in the re
port? Well, now, you know." said Mr.
Huntlngton. with a wise wink, "I have
been away so long that really I have lost
all track of such matters."
"Do you know that some of the land
leased to individuals is, in fact. Intended
for the Standard people?"
â¢ "I can't say that I do know that such
Is the case," was the reply. "You see,
the Standard Oil Company is buying its
oil. not leasing it."
"Would the Southern Pacific sell its pe
troleum lands provided a satisfactory of
fer were made?" Mr. Huntlngton was next
asked. *
"As for that I wouldn't say. It would
be a matter for the directors to determine.
One thing is certain, however; we shall
not sell until we know what we have got
to sell."
This latter statement is significant, par
ticularly so since it was followed by a re
mark that the company has now a good
force of men drilling and sounding new
territory to determine, if possible, the
magnitude of the supply.
Mr. Huntlngton was asked if, in the
event of a sale, the Standard Oil Company
would be able to furnish the Southern Pa
cific with the product at as favorable a
price as the railroad is able to produce it.
He was of the opinion that the oil com
pany could not.
Should the Southern Pacific part with
its petroleum land It is very likely that
there would be an agreement by which
the railroad would receive at a stated
price all the oil needed for its own use.
Mr. Huntington did not think the com
pany would ever market any of the petro
leum as its business is railroading, not
oil making or oil selling.
It Is said that Mr. Huntington person
ally is Interested in a number of petro
leum fields that already give promise of
developing into money making invest-
A branch track has Just been completed,
or practically so. extending from Bakers
field well up into the oil regions, which
is another indication that the company is
exercising more than common activity In
sounding and developing Its property in
the petroleum country.
In regard to the improvements now be
ing made to the Central Pacific road In
Utah and Nevada, Mr. Huntlngton said
that the changes would greatly Increase
the efficiency of this road and would also
result In quicker connection between San
Francisco and Chicago. The money with
which these Improvements, which include
much grading and shortening, are made
was set aside before the death of Collis
P. Huntlngton. The total amount origin
ally was $3,500,000. and a good deal of this
has already been spent.
Mr. Huntington said that his plans at
present are to " remain in California,
though he will make occasional trips to
New York, as formerly. He speaks very
highly of Mr. ( Hays, the new president,
and expects him here early in January.
