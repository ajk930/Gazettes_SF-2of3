STICKS TO BE HANGED
FOB. THREE MURDERS
Law "Will Avenge the Killing of
Eancjier Shanklin and Mr.
and Mrs. Knapp.
KALASIA. Dec. 19.â Martin Stickel was
to-day found guilty of murder in the first
.degree for the killing of William B.
Ehacklln in November, 1S99, at his home
near Kelso. Shanklin was shot while eat
ing bis eupper and the house was burned
by the murderer. The case was shrouded
in mystery and no clew to the murder
could bj. obtained.
On the evening of November 28. 1900. Mr.
and Mrs. Cornelius Knapp, an aged cou
ple living near Castle Rock, were killed
while at their supper table. It was evi
dent that the same roan had committed
both crimes. The latter murder was
traced to Martin Stickel. who lived on. a
kow near the mouth of the Cowlltz River.
ar.d he was arrested. He maintained his
innocence until confronted with the fact
that his watca and keys had been Identi
rifd as having belonged to Shanklin. the
murdered man. Then he made a confes
eior* of all three murders.
When arraigned in the Superior Court
to-day he pleaded not ruilty. The defense
attempted to prove that the man bad in
herited a criminal disposition to^the'ex
- tent that he was not accountable for his
f aV-tlons. His mother testified that - be-'
fore his birth 'she was mad at everybody
ar.d that the child was born sick and was
always unnatural.
The Jury was out but one hour. The
priBocer was sentenced by Judge Miller to
be hanged on a date to be hereafter fixed.

HOME IN CART
A â¢".. ' CLIMAX was reached yesterday
M\^ '-' in the suit for libel instituted by
JhJL Baron J. H. von Schroeder
_l^\^ against The Call. The defense
â¢Â» â¢ of . this paper was submit. ed.
Its testimony was completed
and the presentation of the facts offered
In justification of the article, character
ized as libelous, was closed. * Perhaps the
most important witness of the day was
John D. Spreckels,' the proprietor of The
Call. He testified that he had absolutely
no thought of malice for Baron von
Schroeder. He declared that he-knew
Baron von Shroeder casually, enough to
bow to him in passing, to salute him. In
places of general meeting and to express
the customary greeting between men.
With Karon von Schroeder the proprietor
of this paper declared that he had never
had any business transaction, no quarrel
and no occasion for ill feeling.' There ww
nothing In their relations to Inspire a
I feeling of malice.
Mr. Spreckels declared that he knew
nothing of the alleged libelous article un
til he read it in The Call. He had beÂ»sn
absent from the city, a week or more be
fore the publication of the article and had
not been consulted In reference to It.
When he read the article and. saw In an
evening newspaper the dubiously phrased
denial of R. H. Warneld he determined
to make a searching inquiry and learn
whether or not his instructions to the
manager of The Call to Investigate and
absolutely verify every article tiTore
publishing it had been obeyed.
The result of this inquiry was deeply
significant. Mr. Spreckels testified that
he had several Interviews with R. H.
Warneld. who informed him that the arti
cle published. In The Call was true; that
every fact presented was without exag
geration.
More than this, R. H. Warneld declared
that he had written his quasi denial sim
ply to protect himself from Baron von
Schroeder, from whom he sought to se
cure a release from his obligations as
lessee of the Hotel Rafael. Warttadd de
clared In these- interviews that he feared
the Baron would refuse .to grant the re*
lease If tho formal denial was not writ--
Â¦5 Going still : farther Â¦ Warneld Â¦; declared
,thnt .from several' sources he. was con
vinced that the charges made In The Call
were true'Jhd had represented to the pub
lic the facts which had injured his busi
ness as lessee of the Hotel Rafael.' Baron
von Schroeder, through his attorney, had
Bought to Induce him to deny the truth of
the published article, but he could not in
honesty do so. Â¦
With these facts In his possession the
proprietor of The Call declared that he
was assured that the published article
should neither be retracted nor; piodlfled.
While he was testifying the attorney for
Von Schroeder made every possible at-:
tempt to prevent the introduction of his
evidence. The plaintiff had adopted these
tactics of obstruction for the entire day.
The testimony offered by other wit
nesses was of the most sensational char
acter. Some of it waS> of such a shock
ing nature that It cannot be published.
The notoriously immoral life of Baron von
Schroeder was pictured so In the matter
of fact recital of evidence that even , the
morbidly curious crowd that listened was
stunned into silence and the scene reached
the evil dignity of a moral tragedy, the
Incidents of which cannot, in public de
cency, be reproduced nor even suggested.
One witness was placed upon the stand
and .the court and jury listened to. the
story of actions that, made night hideous
at the Hotel Rafael. It was "the stcry
of the conduct of drunken . men and
women gambling throughout the : hours of
the night, roystering, singing, shouting,
wagering in disgraceful hazards and call-
Ing upon themselves the rebuke of those
In whose keeping was the reputation and
the prosperity of the hotel.' "While the
reputable guests of the hotel were asleep
Baron yon Schroeder and his intoxicated
men and women friends were holding
high carnival In the clubhouse. -^V;
They were gambling at poker, the lights
were blazing from, the windows, drunken
voices were raised in excitement and in
the recklessness of liquor. Glasses were
smashing and from the custodian of the
hotel's welfare came the command to
cease ana put out the lights. The com
mand was. disobeyed. Baron" yon
Schroeder answered It with the announce
ment that a few more "Jackpots" were to
be played and then It was 4 o'clock in the
morning.
And then the scene changed from
smashing , bottles, games of /poker, / male
and female Indecency in the darkness of
the night to the light of day, to -other
scenes of immorality, to other grbssnes3,
to assignations in the gardens of ; the"
hotel,*- to .. clandestine meetings In . tho
tower flaunted 'in the faces of men and
women who had reputations to lose.
Throughout It all the attorney of Baron
von Schroeder "interposed . his objections.
When an effort was made through a wit
ness to prove another justification of the
alleged . libelous. article Von '- Schroeder's
attorney objected and carried his point.
A witness whose duty he ; said is to put
out ; from ; a . local . hotel . immoral -> women,"
fires Â¦ and ; thieves attempted to show also
that he had put out immoral. men. ;The
attorney -for. Baron von Schrbeder ' ob-,

PHILADELPHIA. Dec. 19.-Former
President Grover Cleveland contributes to
this week's Issue of the Saturday Even
ing Post of Philadelphia an extended arti
cle on the plight of t,he Democracy and
the remedy. Mr. Cleveland begins by re
viewing the history of the party, and he
discusses its defeats since 1S64 in detail.
In taking up the question of the present
conditions of the Democracy, he says that
the success or tne party in 1SS2 was 60 de
cisive and overwhelming that a long con
tinuance of its supremacy was antici
pated. Then came the "fallacy of free
silver and Populism."
Mr. Cleveland proceeds as follows:
"The culmination of Democratic woe
was reached when Its compact with these
undemocratic forces was complete, and
when our rank and file were summoned to
do battle under banners which bore
strange symbols and wnlch were held
aloft in unfamiliar hands. The result of
such a betrayal was foredoomed. This
abandonment of the principles of true
Democracy, this contemptuous disobedi
ence of its traditions and this deliberate
violation of the law of its strength and
vig-or were by a decree as inexorable j as
those of fate followed by the inevitable
punishment of stunning, staggering de
feat.
"The disaster of 1S72. invited by. similar
mad adventure, was quickly followed., by
a return *o the profession's: and. practices,
of sane Democracy. But^the-. extent and
persistence of our wanderings In 1S3Â« is
Illustrated In a most astounding way by
the command, issued on the day of . our
rout and discomfiture, that a second bat
tle should be fought on the same field,
with the same false war cries and the
same leadership that had brought us to
the surrounding gloom of defeat.
"Thus In 1900. the lesson of 1ST<|. was con
temptuously rejected, and every hope of
Democratic success was willfully cast
aside. Again our long-suffering rank and
file, whose loyalty and obedience de
served better things, were sacrificed in a
cause theirs only In name, and again it
was demonstrated, but more /Nearly than
ever before, that the only forces that can
win Democratic success are adherence to
recognized Democratic principles and re
liance upon Democratic counsels and lead
ership.
"Why should we not return to these and
Jn their name again achieve victories no
leps glorious and renowned than were ours
in the days of courageous advocacy of our
time-honored faith? Are our principles so
shopworn or antiquated as to require ren
ovation or their displacement by others
more fashionable? There is not an honest
Democrat in this broad land that will not
concede these, nor is there one who will
not hall the proclamation of the old faith
with that fighting enthusiasm that beto
kens Democratic triumph. As new condi
tions arise our principles must be applied
to them, but in the creed that ha* guided
us through a century of party existence
we shall find the key to every- such appli
cation; nor shall we need the lexicon of
Populism to aid us iff interpreting this
Further on he declares:
"I believe no Democrat will have the
hardihood to deny that we have fought
our last two campaigns in alliance with
undemocratic forces and that this alliance
was Immensely costly in defeat. Is there
not good reason to suppose that even In
success Buch an alliance I would have
proved unprofitable and dangerous?"
He preaches the return 'of 'Democracy
to its old faith, saying:
"Sincere Democrats of every condition
and in every part of the land realize that
the situation of the party needs Â¦ repair.
Reorganisation is not necessary,, but a
return. from our wandering is absolutely
essential. Let us be frank with ourselves
and candidly acknowledge the futility of
attempting to gain Democratic ' victories
except in the Democratic cause and
through Democratic methods. Reorgan
ization is worse than. useless, and the ar
rogation of superior party virtue 7 will
breed only mischief. This is a time: for'
sober thought, tolerant language and fra
ternal counsels. We are dealing with the
condition. of a party that cannot ; be de
stroyed by "external' foes, and, since its
ruin can be wrought only from within. It
should be imperishable. Above all things
there should be a manly renunciation and
avoidance of undue sectional control
Democracy will not operate efficiently on
sectional lines.
"There Is much for us to do, and the
future Is full of Democratic duty and op
portunity. Our fighting forces will re
epond listlessly and falterlngly. if
moned to a third defeat In a strange
cause, but if they hear the rallying c*al\
of true Democracy they, will gather ' for,
battle ' with the old time* Democratic *en-^
thusiasm and courage. ' Â«
"If I should attempt, to epitomize what !
I have written, by suggesting a. plan for
the rehabilitation . and Â¦ restoration 'of i true
Democracy I should embody it. In these'
words: , 'Give the rart aÂ»Â£ ?^Â» T~ c 5 jÂ£.Â«:ce.' "

year-old son of Edwin Cudahy, who dis
appeared from his home in Omaha Tues
day evening and for whom the police have
been searching sines his disappearance,
returned at 1:30 o'clock this morning. At
the time of his return two policemen were
en (ruard at the house but did not know
anything about the boy's reappearance
Witil one of the family came out and told
them that their services were dispensed
-with, that Eddie had returned. The offl
cfrs inquired for particulars, but none ot
the family would make a statement ex
cept to say that a full statement would be
made in the morning.
The pchce are of the opinion that the
bey was not abducted, but ran away and
returned home of hi* own volition.
Mrs. Cudahy stated, however, that her
ton had been abducted, but had been
tr^&ied kindly and was all right.
Thope who have been working on the
case and who are in a position for inside
information are of the opinion that the
young man had had a quarrel with some
member of the family and took this means
of seeking revenge.
The mortal strain through which Mr.
And Mrs. Cudahy have passed since the
disappearance of their son was telling on
them. Mr. Cudahy has almost totally
collapsed for the time being, and Mrs.
Cudahy is feeling the effects of her anx
iety to a remarkable degree.
Toung Cudahy left home at 8 o'clock
Tuesday night to take some books to the
r*Â«i-d*Â£j-e o* CÂ»ptairt BiiEiia, - a&cut two
block* Clstar.t. and that was' the last seen
of him. AÂ« midnight arrived and he did
rot return the police were notified and
â¢two detectives were detailed to work on
the case.
It. was not until nearly 9 o'clock yester
day morning, however, that the matter
began to assume a really serious aspect.
At that hour a man on horseback rode
Â¦rapidly by the Cudahy mansion, and as he
passed the front pate threw a letter Into
the yard. A servant who saw him took
the letter into the house, where It was
read. It eaid in substance:
"Mr. E. A. Cudahy: Your eon Is safe.
We have him and will take good care of
him and will return him to you in consid
eration of the payment of $2o.OOO. We mean
business. â * JACK."
Thp remainder of the note the police at
present refuse to disclose, as they say it
rolatr-s to the place where the money is to
be left and where the kidnapers are to
leave the boy In case Mr. Cudahy com
ities with their terms. The Â«?ervajit who
fair, the nan on horseback was able to
pive a good dfscription of him, and this
is the clew upon which the police are
we r king at present.
IXirir.g the day Mr. Cudahy sent tele
gram? to cities throuchout the country
far and.ne-'ir, each of which gave a de
scription cf the boy. The youth la
described as 15 years of age. weight 120
jiourdf. heUrht five f*Â»et eljrht inches, com
plexion light, nose retrousse. He wore a
pray suit of clothes and a black overcoat
Â¦with Mack velvet collar.
E. A. Cudahy last night telegraphed his
brother, illchael Cudahy. of Chicago, to
eend a force of Plnkerton detectives to
this city at once and they are expected to
arrive here some time to-morrow, when
they will be put to work on the case. The
entire force cf a local detective ag%ncy
Â£ja& all the available local detectives have
fdso been started on the search.

Q.â Oh, that It was at a subsequent Inter-'
view that he. had said that? .......
A.â Yes, sir.
Q.â How long after the first? :
Mr. Delmasâ Now, if your Honor please, the
learned .jcounsel . has, very unintentionally, of
course, made Mr. Spreckels assent to a state
ment which he never- made. Mr. Bpreckals
never said that he' modified it: he said that
General War field bad refused to sign It.
The Courtâ Well. Mr. Spreckels haÂ« stated
now that he never so stated.
. Mr. MaÂ«ulrÂ» â He stated that that occurred
at a subsequent interview.
Mr. Delmasâ No, sir, that tbat did occur, not
that he modified it . Â¦â¢
. The Courtâ Mr. Spreckels has already stated
that he did not so state.
Mr. Maguire â I want to say that I don't caxa
anything about that, whether he stated that
he modified it or insisted' that It should be
changed.
Mr. Delmasâ He did not Insist that It be
changed.
The Courtâ Mr. Spreckel* himself corrected It.
Mr. Delmaaâ Very well. â¢
" Mr. Mayuire: Q.â Mr. Bpreckels, was any
thing said at that first Interview on the 2i5th
Of October about General Warfleld' s having
objected to the phraseolosy of ' another letter
that was drafted by somebody?
A. â Not at that time, buyat a subsequent
meeting.
â¢ Q.â Well, I will come to that meeting pres
ently. You testified, as I understood you. that
General Warfleld called attention to the fact
at that time that his letter." as- published in
the Bulletin, did not deny the truth of the
story aa published in The. Cell, but slrnjiy
â¢tated that be had no .knowledge of th* toM*
that the thing was* truÂ» of hi* own knawled**?
â¢Â¦ Mr. Delmasâ Of his own. personal knowledge.
- Mr. Magulre â Of his own knowledge. I think
that was the language of Mr. Spreckels. and
that I think, is more accurate than Mr. Leake's
recollection.
The witnessâ "Well. I am statins it from
recollection: I could not use his exact words.
. Q.â Was tbat the purport of what he said?
- A.â Yes. _ _
' Q.â And that statement was mad* by W*r-
Celd to you? . - -

Q. â On the 28th of October, 1S33? â¢
A.â Yes. sir.
Q.â Did he say to you at that ttma h* had
no personal knowledge of the fact or that he
knew nothing personally of .the facts? A
A.â No. sir. he did not personally so state.
He said that, in substance, the article wm
true.
Q.â But did he say at that time that ha
had no personal knowledge of the facts?
Had to Write Denial." '- ? *'
A. â Xo. he did not so state. He said that,
in substance. *the article was true, but that
he had to write this denial so as to make it
possible to be released from the lease.
Q.â And did he call your attention to the
fact' that the letter (tated that he did not
have personal knowledge, 'or that the thing
was untrue, so far as his personal knowledge
was concerned ?
Mr. Delmasâ He did not say that.
The Courtâ Do you understand that question,
Mr. Spreckels?
A. â Well, it is rather complicated, but I can
state and reiterate what Mr. Warfleld did say
to me and that will make it plain.
Mr. Magulre â You say he called your atten
tion to the fact at that time that h9 did not
in this letter, in his letter that was published
in the Bulletin, deny absolutely the truth of
The Call's story, but only saKl that so far
as his knowledge went â
Mr. Delmaa (Interrupting) â Now, you , are
reading from the letter and the witness has
not testified from this letter. . . Â¦ , *
Mr. Maguireâ He has said he called his at
tention to something in the letter.
The Courtâ Judge Magulre is now asking thÂ«
witness whether, at thla interview on the 26th
of October. General Warfleld so stated to ! hlm.
Mr. Magulre: Q.â You say he called your at
tention to the form of his statement in the let

A.â The article Itself was not at hand, but
I asked htm concerning his denial.
Q.â Yes? . - . - .
A.â And why, he made It.
Q.â Yea? ' . - . -
A.â And he told me that he had to maka

Proprietor of The Call Hal No
Malice Toward the
Plaintiff..
John D. Bpreckels, the defendant, was
Andrew Ackerpreen was called. Wit-'
r.ess taid he lived in San FYanclsco . and
had been a night watchman it the Palace
Hotel for ten years under three different
managements. Mr. Dt-lmas conducted the
examination. He asked:
"Whet is the nature -of your duties
there?" . .
"To keep out disreputable women and
drunken men and to look out for fires."
"Were you at the hotel on the night of
October 10. 1S99?"
"I was."
"Was your attention called to any Im
propriety that nlgrht?" . .
Magt^re interposed an objection on the
ground that the place was remote from,
tbe scene of the occurrences referred to
in the article alleged to be llbelous.
Delmas contended that the testimony
was admissible, as he sought to produce
evidence directed toward that portion of
the article alleged to be iibelous In which
it was stated that the Baron was now free
to conduct his hotel as he saw fit and in
a position to eave his brother from being
kicked from any more hotels.
"The Jury will be instructed," said
Judge Angellottl." vthat the defendant
need establish the truth of those state
ment* only which are directed at the
plaintiff."
Delm&s argued that the statement re
ferred to would .be used as showing
malice. cn> the contention that the de
fendant had made a wanton attack upon
the plaintlfTs brother. '
The court held that the Instructions to
the Jury would remove any misapprehen
sion on that point and sustained the ob
jection, refuging to let the Palace Hotel
episode be exploited in testimony. r .-

eerve between the plaintiff and his com
panion?"
Magulre objected, but the court ruled
that the question should be answered.
"Tell the jury what you saw. Use gen
eral terms."
"I was taking a stroll after lunch-
About t/iree-quarters of a mile from the
hotel I' Paw a horse with bupgy hitched
to the fence. 1 climbed over the fence
and walked on. and up the hillside under
tome trees I taw the Baron and a lady.
Witness described the conduct of these
two in general terms, but the testimony
is unfit for publication. He continued:
"I went on along thÂ© road and about
twenty minutes later came back and the
two were gone and the horse and buggy
Â¦were gone. I eaw the two again at din
ner."
Witness With a Memory.
On cross-examination witness said he
had been a hunter for eight years and at
present was hunting at Los IJanos. He
had worked occasionally wlth'n that time
as a waiter at the University Club and
Palace and Pleasanton hotels. For three
years he had occasionally hunted terrapin ',
ancrtiac hunting terrapin early in IMS, be
fore going to the Hotel Rafael. Â¦ He began i
working at the hotel June 4 and remained
there until August 15. Magulre questioned
him closely about his hunting trips subse-
Quent to that date, and witness was able
to answer readily, describing trip6 to
Truckee, to the vicinity of Santa Bar
tiara, into Nevada and other places, giv
ing dates with an exactness that baffled
counsel's attempt to discredit his testi
mony. Onco when he Bald be did. not re
member Judge Magulre asked if bis mem
ory was bad. though witness had shown
a memory for dates and his doings for
jears past that was no less than remark
able.
"Who came to you about this case?"
"Harry McKenrie. a waiter, who came
down to Los Angeles with a letter of in
troduction from two friends of mine."
"Was anything said to you about pay,
or there being money in it?"
"He di<l not."
After a long examination concerning his
past life Maguire. asked the witness if he
were employed In the dining-room all the
time he was at the Hotel Rafael.
"Yes, Â»ir" was the answer.
"I>o you remember what day It was that
you saw the plaintiff on the hill back of'
the Hotel Rafael?"
"I do not remember."
"Was it in June?"
"I cannot say."
"In July, or August?"
"I do not remember."
"Or in September?" Â»
"No, it was not in September. I had
left the hotel August 15."
Â¦ "How close were you to the plaintiff
and a ladv when you first saw them?"
"Probably 150 or 160 leet."
"Did you continue to advance toward
them?"
"YeÂ«. sir; I walked slowly toward
them."
"And did you go within ten feÂ«t of them,
as you say in your deposition?"
"Yes." ':',
"What did you do then?"
"I went on up the hiJl and around oi
the other side of it and then came back
the came way. It took me about twenty
minutes to get back to where the horse
had been hitched."

Scandal That Was Not Published.
A.â Well, on or about the 10th of October, at
night, about 12 o'clock. I received a telephone
message from The Call office, and Mr. Leake
was at the other end. He said: "Mr. Bpreck

to consult you. There are a number of prom
inent people Involved in it, and I can't give
you ' their names over the telephone, and I
think It is important enough for you to come

rode down to the editorial rooms," â¢ reaching

The story of an episode which occurred- 1 â ---
Mr. Maguireâ I want to object at -this point.
If you will call this matter out by question,

The Courtâ I don't quit# understand this.
Mr. Delmasâ It is somewhat difficult to make
it understood upon this : bare objection. .Mr.
Epreckels has been charged- with malice here
and he hat been charged with malice in terms
very ' emphatic, If â¢ not vituperative. *. by, the
counsel on the other side, who has denounced
him' as a malicious man, .who was using his
newspaper and- his wealth to gratify his ; per
sonal malice . agslnst this plaintiff. That Is
about the substance of it. Now tne purportof
the testimony which I desire to _ introduce " is
this: That some weeks before the publication
of the article In question another transaction,
quite like the stories that have been detailed
here in evidence was given to the newspaper.'

tlon to a certain line of argument which has
*>een produced " here, with your Honor's sanc
tion. The subsequent conduct of Mr. Spreckels
or of his manager has been allowed to be
given In evidence here for the purpose of show
ing malice, and a line of evidence has been
offered I to show or in order to attempt to
prove that they were malicious, to show that
a certain publication, whether authorized or
not, or whether genuine or not, appeared In
an evening paper, and that notwithstanding
the publication In that paper the manager or
f'l-oprietor of The Call did .not retract or mod
fy the publication which they, had made on
the 25th of October; the argument and. the
Implication being, as I take It, that It was
their duty after seeing this letter or learning
of the letter of General Warfleld, to have made
investigations further into that matter and if
they found that their previous article was
either unwarranted or too severe to have mod
ified or retracted It
May Tre not, by the name line of
reaRonlng, and upon precisely the
Â¦ante aaaloglei, show ~ antecedent
acts on the part of the' proprietor
of. the paper, In order to satisfy. this
jory that, far from having any mal
ice agalimt this plaintiff,' the propri
etor of Itial'pnper had, aflralnst . the
Judgment of his staff, exercised his
personal authority to suppress 1 a
previous article npon him, and to
shield him to that extent, . in hopes
of reformation f
It Is exactlyâ â
Mr. Magulre (Interrupting)â The statement of
Mr. Delmas Is entirely and absolutely improper.
He is not now merely arguing for the admis
sion of this evidence. . Â¦ â¢ Â¦ -
Mr. Delmas â Pardon me. Â«
Mr. Magulreâ I am interrupting the argument
because of statements that are ' improper . con
tained In it. ' :
The Courtâ He has simply stated what he ex
pected to prove. ; â¢ .. . - . . , . Â¦
Mr. Magulre â Yes, sir, and the Supreme Court
has repeatedly declared that that is not the.
proper thing to do. .,.-..
Mr. Delmasâ If your Honor please, there is a
well known and proper way to object to a state
ment. If I have said anything that is im
proper the learned counsel can object to it. If
he will call it to my attention by objection, ami
I acknowledge the error, I shall retract It; but
the habit of getting up and interrupting coun
sel in an argument is neither commendable, in
my opinion, nor leads to the orderly conduct of
the case, however frequently It may. have been
Indulged in here. I said that if the subsequent
conduct of the defendant may be shownâ and
that It may be established In this case by your
Honor's rulingsâ by a parity of reasoning, it
to my mind seems inevitable that previous con
duct may also be shown; just as in the case of
the condition of a man's mind as to soundness
or unBoundness when, for instance, 'he executed
a will, the ultimate inquiry is -in this case,
what was the condition of the testator's mind
at the very time that he executed this will?
Was his mind sound or was it unsound? Was It
rational or irrational T Was it tainted with prej
udice or bias against certain . Individuals, â¢ or
was it candid and free? Was . it -. subject ' to
undue Influence, or was it acting with entire
liberty? And, although the voice. of the Inquiry
be the exact point of time at which the will
was executed, no one better â¢ knows than - the
learned counsel, and, of course, your Honor,
that a broad latitude of inquiry 13 permitted
of a period, both before and after that time, In
order, as the authorities Fay, that the light of
the past and the future may be reflected, one
forward and the other backward, upon this
particular point. Now, prejudice .â¢-, or blae,
subjection to Influence, or entire freedom,
soundness or unsoundness, ; are ' mental
conditions, and if this mental . . condi
tion can be thus Illustrated, why Is ' not
malice, which Is also a mental condition, to be
eimllarly illustrated ? \ If the subsequent - con
duct of the testator, ' after his will, may, be
shown, in order to determine what his mental
condition was at the: time he made his will;
If his previous conduct may be shown. for the
same purpose, why may it not, in a case of this
kind, where the subsequent conduct of the pro
prietor of the paper has already been shown, be
also met with the analogy that his : previous
conduct may equally be given in evidence. . and
especially when it Is of a period so close to the
point of the inquiry, in order to show that - he
was entirely free from any malicious disposi
tion toward this plaintiff? -That is the
purpose. Aid, as is well .. suggested,
the learned counsel on . the other - â¢â¢ side
could undoubtedly, had they the pi*of at hand,
have gone i backward as they have r gone for
ward, and proven expressions of 111-wlU - on
the part of Mr. Spreckels toward the plaintiff,
could they not, within a period of fifteen days,
or a month; or six weeks, or six months? They
could have Â¦ shown undoubtedly that Mr.
Bpreckels had made declarations evincing his
hostility, . his â¢Â¦ spite, his desire to injure < this
man. If he had made them; and If those expres
sions and that conduct could be given for. the;
purpose of showing malice, why may -we not
give -an 1 entirely different course- of conduct
in evidence for the purpose of showing that
there was no malice?
The Court's Buling.
The Courtâ Of course, the : defendant will, be
allowed to : Introduce < any .: testimony - that â¢Â¦ he
has to rebut, â¢ to answer any testimony that
hat * been brought f orward by the plaintiff "con-"
cernlng subsequent acts, to show ! malice. ' The
defendant Is also ' allowed, as I understand the
rule, to testify that at the time of the : pub
lication he had no feeling: of ill-will, and never
had any feeling of Ill-will against the person;
alleged to be libeled. I don't think ' that Â¦â¢ he
has the Â¦ right, however, â¢ to -" Introduce declara
tions made prior to the time of the publication
for that purpose. The objection Is sustained.':
Mr. Delmasâ We , will save , the - point. ' -Â¦ In
order, and without 'any desire of avoiding
your Honor* i â¢ ruling, but squarely A to -the
point, and in conformity, with the suggestion!!
made by Â¦ my . associate, the- exact point that
we desire to prove here is more than a declara
tion; It is an act.. -s , ' . ' ,-"-- i - . -

GUGGENHEIM WORKS

American Smelting and Refining
Company Makes an Offer for
the Plant. .
NEW, YORK, Dec. 19.â Announcement
was made to-day of the proposed absorp
tion of the Guggenheim silver smelting
plants by the American Smelting: and Re
fining Company. To accomplish this tho
stockholders of the latter company will
be asked to assent to the proposition that
the capital be Increased from $55,000,000 to
$100,000,000. Of this amount $15,000,000 will
be added to the working capacity of the
company. Officials of the smelting com
pany decline to make known how much it
has been agreed to pay for the Guggen
heim â¢ properties, but the inference per
mitted to be drawn was that the Guggen
heims receive something like the differ
ence between the $55,000,000 and $100,000,000.
less the $15,(500.000 which it is prpposed to
utilize for extra working capacity. It
was also stated that none of the new
stock would - be offered for Bale. It J -.
expected that the stockholders of the
smelting company will hold a special
meeting within the next two weeks to
ratify the action of the directors.

meeting of the current year, closing the
first year of the existence of the joint
passenger agreement. To thla agreement
Is due the present satisfactory condition
of the westbound passenger rate situa
tion, which, according to the unanimous
testimony of the general passenger agents
as expressed at the meeting, is better than
It has ever been at the end of every pr
vlous year. At the meeting a proposition
was considered to rearrange the New
York-Chicago rates of the"' differential
lines, bo as to make them conform with
those of the Erie, which would mean that
the West Shore, the Lohigh Valley, the
Lackawanna and the Baltimore and Ohio
would have to charge $18 for the trip in
stead of J17. The proposition was laid
over until the next meeting.

PARIS, Dec. 19.â The French Gov
ernment has given the most em
phatic denial to those French pa
pers which tried to involve the
American Embassy in the Paris
disclosures in connection with the United
States War Department's knowledge of
French gun secrets by offering the cross
of the Legion of Honor to Lieutenant W.
S. Sims, the former United States naval
attache at Paris, whom La Presse de
scribes as the person guilty of disclosing
the gun secrets. When the news - was
first published here the anti-governmental
press at once moved to use it as a weapon
spainst the Ministry; and La Presse ac
cused anonymously the ex-naval attache
of the United States Embassy, making the
description so distinct that diplomatic cir
cles knew Lieutenant Sims was intended.
It said, among other' things, that "he
acted almost openly as a spy for several
years." - .
The news became public to-day that M.
Delcasse, the Minister of Foreign Affairs,
had offered the cross of the Leyion of
Honor to Lieutenant Sims, who is now on
board the battleship Kentucky. As the
lieutenant Is a Government official he is
unable to accept the honor without the
consent of Congress.

LONDON, Dec. 19.â The story, of Lady
Miles, widow of Sir Philip -Miles- â¢ her
thousands and a bucket shop. Is being
told before a Lord Chief Justice, the lady
having sued Messrs. Duncans of "Water
loo Place for Â£C127, the proceeds of a sale
of consols. Â» . . .-â¢ v'
Duncans Is the name under which Hen
ry Lowenfeld of the Shaftesbury Theater.
A. A, Hannay and W. Stark do business
as outside, or "curb". stock brokers. They
issued a book called "How Money Makes

August, 1S9S, and wrote to Messrs. Dun
cans. , Since then Â£10,000 or more of her
money has passed through . Duncans'
bands. â¢.Â¦..
Lady Miles began with a three-share
deal In/August, 189S. On November, 1899,
transactions involving about Â£100,000 were
open between her ladyship and Duncans.
"While the firm," said the plaintiffs
counsel, "were/ ever ready with advice to
Lady Miles about buying stocks and
shires, whenever, she bought they, al
ways sold." . ; Â¦.'.-"
Â¦Â¦ Toward j the end of the dealings Lady
Miles' r- daughter suggested to Messrs.
Duncans that It would be a good thing to
sell -instead' of buying. Mr. Hannay told
her it would be ruinous to "sell or bear."
: Saftf â¢: Lady Miles: "I now see-it would
have been ruinousâ to him; so he did not
sell." .
Lady Miles decided to so in more heav

Panama Company and Colombian
Government Oppose Nicara
guan Route.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 19.âUnderstand
ing that action by the United States fav
orable to the Nicaragua canal will mean
the death of the Panama enterprise,
Colombia is prepared to join forces with
the Panama Canal Company and the Pa
cific railroad Interests to block the enact
ment of canal legislation by Congress.
Colombia appreciates that the Panama
Canal Company cannot possibly comptete
the Panama waterway with the funds
now available, and that In order to effect
Its completion the company will have to
make a loan of at least $100,000,000. It also
understands that so long as there is agi
tation in the United States for the con
struction of the Nicaragua canal the Pan
ama Company will be unable to raise
funds to execute the work.
It is therefore, regarded as to the, in
terest of Colombia to join forces with
other opponents of the Nicaragua canal
to prevent legislation in favor of that
enterprise, and at the same time to show
to the United States the willingness to
have this Government construct the Pan
ama canal.
Although the Minister for Foreign Af
fairs of Colombia has privately an
nounced the purpose of his Government
to re-establish its legation here, he has
not communicated the fact to the State
Department, and the authorities are con
sequently not informed as to the charac
ter of the canal proposals the new Min
ister will submit. That Colombia la will
ing to cancel the concession of the Pan
ama Canal Company, provided she can do
so with profit to herself, there Is no doubt,
but there is no disposition on the part
of the executive to urge her to do so.
TO BLOCK THE CANAL BILL.
.WASHINGTON, Dec. 19.-To-day'g ex
executive session of the . Senate demon
strated that the discussion of the Hay-
Pauncefote treaty by that body Is practi
cally exhausted, and that the Senate Is
ready for the vote, which has been fixed
for to-morrow. When, upon Senator
Lodge's motion, the doors were closed to
day and called -up the : treaty, no Sen
ator evinced a desire to speak upon It.
Without making any special request for
speakers. Lodge asked the Senate to take
up the treaty with Spain, providing tor
cession to the United States of the
Philippine Islands of Slbutu and Cag
ayan, Sulu and their dependencies in
consideration of the payment to Spain of
$100,000. Objection to this request was
made by several Senators, including Hoar.
Wellington and Bacon, and Senator Lodge,
with the hope of removing the objection
made, went Into a brief explanation of the
terms of the negotiation. He explained
that the islands axe comprised In the Phil
ippine group, and said that they were sup
posed to have been ceded by Spain In the
Paris treaty, and the United States had
taken possession of the islands under this
supposition. It was soon found, however,
that the definite line of our acquisition
fixed by the freaty cut both of them out.
It Is a rule of law. he explained, that a
definite boundary description always su
persedes an indefinite description. Hence
in order to leave no doubt of our owner
ship, the treaty for the cession of these
islands hed been negotiated, and he be
lieved that the United States would be
saved much trouble in the future by con
summating the bargain. He characterized
the proceeding as in the nature of a quiet
ing title process. Lodge also called atten
tion to the fact that one of the islands*
is directly on the line of communication
with Borneo and the straits, and he drew
the conclusion That seine day it mght be
important as a cable station.
Senators Hoar and Bacon said they
would like to have more time to consider
the question, and Senator Wellington
made unqualified objection.
Accordingly the treaty was laid aside
for the time being.

LIEUTENANT SIMS DID
NOT STEAL GUN SECRETS
west point. n\ y.. Dec. 19.â Some in
teresting testimony was brought out to
day by the court of Inquiry which is in
vestigating- the alleged hazing of cadets
at the Military Academy here In connec
tion with the recent death of former Ca
det Boor.
Thirty-five cadets were examined dur
ing the morning and afternoon sessions.
tna of these one was the brother of Lieu
tenant Hobson of Merrlmac fame, an
other was the son of General Phil Sheri
dan and a third Mark Brooke of Pennsyl
vania, a nephew of General Brooke, who
f the presiding: officer of the court. All
three told of the hazing they got during
the encampment of 1896. at the time Booz
wag their classmate, and not one of them
said that the treatment received or the
things they had to do were either brutal
cr degradirg.
Hobeon's worst ordeal was when he had
to stand on his heaiJ in a bathtub in which
there were about ien inches of water. He
eaid he was partially strangled, but was
all right in a few minutes. Young Phil
Sheridan was made to ride a broomstick
â¢iloig the street in commemoration of his
Illustrious father's ride, and he had to
keep shouting 'Turn, boys, turn," all the
time. He did not think this was humil
iating, he said, although he did not relish
the task.
In nearly every instance the witnesses
said that all the more brutal forms of
hazing were obsolete, and while "bracing""
was etlll practiced secretly it was against
the regulations, and if any one were de
tected violating these regulations he
would bo summarily dealt with and se-_
verely punished. There are about a score'
or more of Boooz's classmates to be ex
amined, and there are several of the first
class men to be hoard from as well as
some of the officers. The court may not
ret through the taking of testimony until
Saturday.
Treatment Accorded Them Was In No
Instance Degrading or Brutal
According to Their
Views.

NATURAL GAS FOUND IN
EASTERN WASHINGTON
Discovery Made Through Applying
a Match to a Bubble on
- a Lake.
TACOMA, Dec. . 19.â The discovery of
natural gas along Pine Creek, in Eastern
Washington, is the cause of much excite
ment at Rosalia. Spokane men have ob*
tained leases on 8000 acres of land near
Pine City. The farmers now steadfastly
refuse to enter into any more contracts
until they ascertain to a certainty what
really exists under their land. Â¦
Several exhibition tests of the gas show
that it is of good quality. The gas es
capes in large bubbles through the water
of Pine Creek and Rock Lake. This phe
nomenon has been observed by people of
that vicinity for the paat twenty-two
years, but none thought of it being gas
until this fall, when some one applied a
lighted match to a bubble and a blaze re
sulted. â¢ Â¦ Â¦ Â¦â¢'Â¦Â¦-:â¢'â¢ v- !
Williams repeatedly demanded of the

but they refused. Prior to commencement
of the action Williams assigned his ac
count to his wife. Mrs. Dora Williams,
and on the 12th of December, 1DO0, Mrs.
Williams assigned to Charles H. Peters
the account and claim against the defen
dants for his own use and benefit in part,
and as trustee of an express trust to the"

shares A. C. Hamilton departed from the-
State of Nevada, and he has returned only/
at rare intervals, and has not been In the
State more than two year altogether since
August 14, 1SS4. Senator Jones still claims
to be a resident of Nevada, but soon after

plaint, he departed from Nevada and haa
not been within the State more than one
year altogether since that time. ;

TACOMA, Dec. 19.â Tacoma has been
selected as one of the new Â¦Western fields
for the establishment of a branch of the
Church of Latter-Day Saints, or the Mor
mon Church. Delegates from Salt Lake
City have begun a house-to-house can
vass with the object of making converts
to the faith and organizing a tabernacle
In this city. There are four of them In
all and they are canvassing the city
thoroughly, each being well supplied with
literature and ready at all times to-an
swer questions.
Tacoma is not the only place that has
been selected for the expansion of this
faith. In many of the towns and cities
of the Northwest the work is going on
and in some, it is said, there has been
good progress. Before the present prose
lltizing movement shall have ended, it Is
intended to have Mormon churches estab
lished in all the leading communities of
the Northwest. If this can be done 'the
Mormon Church probably will be made
national In its territorial scope, instead of
being confined chiefly to Utah.
The Mormon pamphlet distributed herÂ©
disclaims the teachings of polygamy. It
is of twenty-four pages and treats of
faith, repentence, baptism, reception of
the Holy Ghost, authority and articles of
faith.

"From Teller City to Checkers, in the Koogrock district, is about
130 miles.
"The strikes were all made late in July and In August. Bedrock
has been reached in none of the claims, and bedrock Is where such
placers show their richness. On the Koogrock creeks coarse gold was
found among the grass roots. In Xo. 7 on Quartz Creek two men took
out $1200 In seven hours. In a number of others from $200 to $300 per
day was taken out with a rocker. Single pans gave as high as $21.
And remember all this was practically surface mining. No one
knows how rich the placers may prove as bedrock Is ap
proached.
"The Koogrock tributaries that jrive most promise are Harris,
Quartz, Garlield, Dahl, North Fork and Coffey. but of course claims
are not now to be had except by purchase In any of the creeks show
ing colors. N. T, Brander, Charles D. Lane. Count Podhoraki and a
Mr. Hirschler have bought up the cream of the claims In the Koog
rock district.
"All of the creeks emptying Into Grantley harbor from the north,
Just across from Teller, show colors and they are all staked off. Eg-
Joo Creek, particularly, promises well. In surface Indications It greatly
resembles Anvil Creek at Nome.
/'Away from the Teller City site the whole country Is tundra. Along
the creeks there are willows plentiful enough to furnish firewood. On
most of the creeks there will be plenty of water for working the pla
cers."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BAN JOSE, Dec. 19.â The prosecution of
Percy Lovejoy for failing to make good
his promise to marry Ethel "Waterhouse,
a pretty seventeen-year-old girl of Moun
tain View, came to a sudden end this
afternoon, the young people getting mar
ried by a Justice of the Peace. A strong
case had been made against Lovejoy, who
had beep brought back from Oregon to
answer to the charge against him. At
noon the prosecution concluded the intro
duction of Its evidence. A number of
witnesses had testified to the good char
acter of the girl. At this stage of the
proceedings Lovejoy expressed his will
ingness to marry Miss Waterhouse/ At
torneys Partridge and Jacobs, who were
assisting the District Attorney's office In
the prosecution, acquainted her with the
fact and she readily consented.
It was decided to keep the affair from
the parents of both in the fear that a
hitch would occur, as bitter enmity
exists between the families of Lovejoy
and Waterhouse on account of the
charge.' Miss Waterhouse and Lovejoy
made their way by separate routes to t^he
office of Attorney B. A. , Herrington,
counsel for the defendant. . A license had
been- procured and Justice Rosenthal ex
cused himself from court for a few min
utes so as to perform the ceremony. The
couple plighted- their troth for all time
and then they, the Judge and the attor
neys adjournedvto the courtroom.
The dismissal of the case came as a
sensation to the -large number, of Moun
tain View people. 'who were. present as
witnesses. " Miss" i Waterhouse's parents
forgave Lovejoy and extended a blessing'
to the couple, but Papa Lovejoy . was
obstinate. He refused to take his newly
acquired daughter-in-law's hand and mut
tered threats that he would drive his son
from home. â¢ ' - â¢ â¢ . - Â¦ â¢ Â¦

COLONEL DE YRIES
LANDS A FORTUNE
FOR A STOCKTONIAN
Howard Bulkley to Be Put Into
Possession of an Estate of Which
He Was Wrongfully De

> . â . _
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, Dec. 19.â Attorney H.'V. J.
Swain will leave to-morrow for New York
to formally accept the transfer of $50,000
to a client, Howard Bulkley, a Stockton
young man. Ex-Congressman de Vrles Is
awaiting his arrival, having made all ar
rangements for the transfer of the es
tate, which .for many years, since the
death of young Bulkley's father, has been
in the hands of M. H. Henderson, a resi
dent of Port Chester, N. Y.
Charles F. Bulkley was a colonel of en
gineers in the Union army during the War
of the Rebellion. In later years he went
to Central and South America, where he
engaged in his profession. He died in
Guatemala of fever. At that time his
wife and son Howard lived In 'this city.
Howard is still a resident of Stockton. It
transpired that Colonel Bulkley had made
a deed of his property, sending the docu
ment to his wife with instructions to for
ward it to his old friend, M. H. Hender
son, who was to keep It until he (Bulkley)
should die.
Repeated efforts failed to get a satis
factory accounting from Henderson, and
Howard Bulkley finally put the matter
into the hands of Colonel de Vrles, Mrs.
Bulkley having died meanwhile. Hender
son has at last come to terms and is
ready to turn over the estate to the law
ful heir. It includes three pieces of prop
erty. In New" York, worth at least $30,000,
and about $20,000 worth of real and per
sonal, property besides.
, The full particulars af the agreement
entered into with Henderson are not
known here, Colonel- de-VrleB having had
charge of the' immediate dealings with
him.* Bulkley will receive practically the
whole $50,000,' less, the expense attendant
upon Its collection. '. ;; ,.' .
TELLER CITY, the new town on Port Clarence Bay, Alaska. Is
but half a year old and more than 1200 people are passing the
winter season there. That it will rival Nome within another
year or two seems likely, and there are some among the re
turned gold hunters who predict that It 1b destined to become
the metropolis of Northwestern Alaska.
W. E. Bates, a young San Franciscan, who was one of the founders
of Teller City and who lately returned from Alaska, says that the
summer's prospecting showed beyond a question that the Koogrock
and Bluestone districts, tributary to the new town, are rich in gold.
He further claims that while Nome has no harbor and Is exposed to
the Bering Sea storms. Teller City has a land-locked harbor, or, rath
er, two of them, and is twelve miles removed from Bering Sea.
The new town is located on the east shore of Port Clarence Bay
and on the southerly shore of Grantley harbor, entrance to which is
gained through a narrow channel. The harbor extends eastward
twelve miles, with a depth of IS to 25 feet. Ocean-going vessels can
discharge freight and passengers from either the bay side or the har
bor side, and are assured safety from the storms that have done such
havoc at Nome.
In July and August hundreds of prospectors stampeded from Nome
to the new fields of the Port Clarence region, and their success in lo
cating claims that give promise of great richness insures an unpre
cedented rush from Nome and other mining camps during the early
spring and summer, and most of those from the outside world who
venture into Alaska will make Teller City their destination.
"When I arrived on July 16 at what Is now Teller City," Mr. Bates
said last evening, "the town had ndt been founded. N. T. Brander
had reached the place somewhat earlier, on the first Kimball steamer
that went up. with a stock of merchandise. A few gold seekers and
traders had begun to pitch teots around his store. Then there came
the reports of strikes in the Koogrock district and a little later In
the Bluestone district, and a Btajnpede began from other mining
camps. Hundreds of disappointed men at Nome Joined the rush to
the new fields, Brander's settlement became a lively town of tents
and all the creeks in the two new districts were staked off Into
claims.
"The people held a meeting August 27 anfl elected a committee of
seven to govern the affairs of the community â a sort of arbitration
committee. A. T. Wright of San Francisco and myself were mem
bers of it. Since I came out a town government has been regularly
organized.
"The town site comprises about forty acres of smooth, firmly
packed gravel, which provides â¢ excellent streets and firm building

COVELO. Dec. 19.-From the Banks
Range, fourteen miles north of Covelo,
comes the etory of a feat of strength ri
valing the herculean achievement of
Ursus, the creation of Sienkiewicx in
"Quo Vadis," who rescued Lypia from
the horns of a bull In the lists at Romt.
One of the bulls at the ranch broke out
cf the corral yesterday and started en a
trip across the parade ground of the In
dian reservation. Several cowboys tried
to la**oo him or drive him back into the
OORal; but without avail. "Chub" Baker,
a vaquero, was charged by the Infuriated
bfast. which gored his horse to death.
Alter the horse had fallen BaKer lay un
conscious upon u:e ground and the bull
iiitompted 10 impale the prostrate man
upon its horns.
At this critical moment Wyatt Jordan
cf an Â¦djoiolmC rancn galloped up and
Quickly dismounting he seized the bull by
tne horns and by mere force of physical
strength ttopptd the infuriated animal
from charging upon the unconscious cjw
l>oy. This remarkable test of strength
continued for several minutes, until ihe
other vaQueros galloped up, carried Ba
ker out oi' clanger and roped and threw
tee bull.
Then Jordan performed another feat in
which he exhibited his remarkable
ttrength end bravery bordering upon
loolhardint-ss. On being praised for his
rescue of Baker he declared the feat was
not difficult, and to prove his words ne
entered the corral in which the still mad
cened bull was pawing up the earth and
bellowing. Attain seizing the animal he
forced it back foot by foot into one cor
ner of the inclosure. Not until the brute
was thoroughly subdued did he release
lia hold upon the horns.
The bull has been viewed by ranchers
living near by and is pronuonced to be an
immense amm&l. Every one wonders at
the superhuman strength shown by
Wyatt. es he is only a common-sized man,
but has long- been known to be unusually
powerful and active. Wyatt has lived in
this section for a number of years and has
always worked on a cattle ranch. His
delight is to lassoo wild bulls and by con
stant torment to Infuriate them until they
â¢will fight madly.
Baker's condition is regarded as critical,
ts he was stepped upon twice and re
ceived internal injuries in falling from his
horse.

Your Name in Gold-
Â¦WASHINGTON. Bee. 19.â The United
States Supreme Court was again crowded
to Its full capacity to-day to hear the
concluding arguments in the cases involv
ing the status of Porto Rico and the Phil
ippines. Among these who secured points |
of vantage In the area reserved for the â¢
bar was Judge Day. who. as Secretary of [
State during the critical stages of the war |
with Spain, and la:er as head of the
American commissioners who negotiated
i the treaty of peace at Paris, was one of
! the most Influential factors In shaping
i the conditions now under 1 discussion be
fore the court. Judge Day gave attentive
ear to the argument of the Attorney Gen
eral, which took up the events following
the treaty of peace and maintained the
right of the Government, pursuant to that
treaty and to the constitution to follow
the bill of action which has. been taken
in these cases relative to the Philippines
and Porto Rico. Near . Judge - Day sat
former Secretary Carlisle and other prom
inent members of the bar and of the two
houses of Congress, while the small cir
cular area open, to f the, general public wa*
filled with 'spectators.* " ' *
Attorney General Griggs, who began the
Government's presentation yesterday, had
four hours remaining, and .he consumed
the entire day, leaving the close, by
Charles H. Aldrich, on the Philippine
case, to be presented to-morrow.
Griggs spoke In the,' calm and ar
gumentative style adopted yesterday, oc
casionally, however, throwing great
earnestness of voice and gesture into the
assertion of the Government's right to
pursue the policy thus far taken.
The Attorney General elaborated the
points enunciated yesterday. One of these
to which special attention was given was
the distinction between organized terri
tories and unorganized territory under the
Jurisdiction of the United States. Justice
Brewer had asked the Attorney General
to make clear his views on this distinc
tion. Grlggs took up territory after ter
ritory -which came under the operation of
the laws of the United States by an act of
Congress specifically extending the laws 'â¢
to the territory and not ex proprio vigore.
He said that while - Rhode Island and
South Carolina stood outside of the Union
they were treated as foreign States and
when they ultimately assented to the
Union Congress pasted a law extending
the revenue laws to. them.
Vermont had, prior to Its admission as
a State, been a part of the territory be
longing to the United States. â¢ If the rev
enue laws were applicable to the terri
tory of Vermont, proprio vigore, it was
an act of superrogatton to extend them to
the State. In the case of Louisiana, the
Attorney General pointed out that all the
declarations of Jefferson were to the ef
fect that in order to come under the
operation of the lawd of the United Stated
those laws must be explicitly extended, to
new acquisitions. Jeflerson selected cer
tain acts to be immediately extended and
others to be extended from time to time
as might be found practicable.-
The Attorney General directed atten
tion, in tne instance of the acquisition of
Klorlda. to the fact that three . American
statesmen, Monroe, John Quincy Adams
and Andrew Jackson, each of whom was
elected President of the United States,
united In declaring officially that the con
stitution- did not apply of Its own -force
to territory newly acquired by this na
tion, by virtue of the act of acquisition, 1
but that such extension must be, accom
plished by the action of Congress.! '
Grlggs also specilied the territorial or
ganization of Oregon, Missouri, Montana
and Wyoming, In each case snowing that
Congress extended the laws to these ter
ritories. â¢ Â¦ Â¦ - . â¢
Finally as to. the extension of . laws to
the territories Griras said that by act of
Congress in 1S74 , Congress had expressly
extended the I constitution and. Federal
Iaw3 to the "organized territories" and to
every, territory "hereafter organized," but
the act went no further than "organized
territories." and could | not be interpreted
to mean that expanse of country entirely
unorganized. The guano islands were
cited in support of the proposition that
territory may belong to or be under the
Jurisdiction of the United States without
being a part of the United States. Over
seventy different islands, keys and groups
of islands have been thus taken possession
of and made for such special purposes the
property of .the United States.'- .They en
joy certain privileges under the law, and
the United States Supreme Â¦- Court has
recognized their status,- but, they, are not
a part of the- United States. 1 . *
Turning from his . books. Grtgss ex
claimed in impassioned tones: :Â¦..:'-Â¦
"Why should this Government be con
sidered- to have less freedom of action
in this matter than other nations? . What
clause of the constitution so compels?
Why ' are i we . so . tied and - bound that : we
are never to secure ; the fruits of victory,
never to acquire an: island of the sea, a
belt across the isthmus, a Â¦ station > for 'a
naval, base, -unless* at the cost of admit
ting those inhabiting. the soil to full rights
as citizens of the United 8tates; whether
they toe cannibals or. savages, granting
them the glorious potentiality of being a
part, of the people of ;Â¦ the. United States?
Did our forefathers hamper us like that?
If so, this. constitution is misshapen as
Richard. the Hunchback, sent* into this
world before his time, scarce half marie
up." and that so lamely and unfashionable
that nations- laugh at us as we > halt by.",
1 , Justices ' Brewer and . Harlan â¢Â¦Â¦â¢ asked > a
number of ? questions. . Â¦ â¢. Justice ' Brewer
asked if the. Attorney General. held that
as Congress extended the constitution and
laws : to the Â¦ organized territories. Con
gress â¢ also could ' take , them â¢... away, from
the- territories. .. ' â¢:..',
," Grigrgs answered , that this was ,: a' most
serious question,'; but -he : thought"; it safe
to say that when the laws were , once ' ex
tended * to : territories 'Â¦-â¢? an ., inviolable '= con
tract; .was : created and', could . not ,.;^ be
broken. ..'Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦' Â¦' ' '.'..;* < \". ' â¢ â¢ .. ;Â¦ ;vÂ»
' : Justice Harlan: asked ; the Attorney Gen
eral to state later on to what extent Con-
Mr. Aldrich will close for the plaintiff
in the < Philippine case to-morrow and the
cases will then be submitted.
Griggs closed his* five hours' speech
with a brilliant and eloquent peroration.
"I am here in a feeble and humble way."'
said he. "to , support the executive and
legislative branches of the Government in
dealing with these momentous questions.
Throughout I have felt a serene confi
dence that nothing "I have advised, noth
ing the Government has done, has been
without Its precedents and' forerunners
from the most illustrious of our fore
fathers, from Jefferson/ Jackson. Madi
son, Gallatln and from Â¦' the great Chief
Justices of the past; that nothing has
been done but which tended to the great
exhaltatldn and extension of our country
and the improvement of the people com
ing under our control."
Instead of seeking" strict and narrow
constructions, he said, the powers of the
executive and legislative branches had
been so construed as to give them a wise
and safe discretion, so that the day
would be hastened when we might give to
these [ new peoples j self government and
to some of them, perhaps, a place in the
galaxy of States.- Â¦ Â¦
- Court adjourned as soon as Griggs fin
ished.
Griggs said "throughout the United
States' referred to the States of the
Union: but Justice Harlan pointed out
that It referred also to the District of
Columbia and the territory west of the
Missouri.
Justice White asked the Attorney Gen
eral if he claimed that Congress could eo
exempt territories from the laws as to
five them privileges not enjoyed by the
tates. Griggs responded that he did so
claim; In fact, the territories had been for
years exempted from internal revenue
and direct taxes. , Â¦
The. Attorney General Referred to -the
celebrated case of .* Loughborough vs.
Blake, whereupon Justice Harlan, reading
from that decision. â¢ asked Griggs what
Chief Justice Marshall meant In saying:
"The power to lay and collect duties, im
posts Â¦ and excises ; may be exercised and
must be exercised 'throughout the United
States.' ". - .
gress could Impose a tariff to be collected
against goods coming .from 'New. Mexico,
Arizona and Alaska. Justice Brewer al
so reminded Griggs that Oklahoma was
not Included in the treaty taking in the
Louisiana and Mexican territory, and was
an apparent exception to the. rule stated
by the Attorney General,
Griggs said that Congress at its last
session In effect declared that the exist
ing tariff laws were applicable against the
goods of Porto Rico. This was in the act
of last March, remitting to Porto Rico
certain duties collected "under existing
laws." This, Griggs declared, was an as
sertion by both branches of the present
Congress that the tariff act, .which- was
the "existing law," operated against Porto
Rico.
The use of "knockout drops" for the
purpose of robbery has been of such fre
quent occurrence recently that the Police
Department asked the Board of Supervis
ors to pass an ordinance making it a mis
demeanor for any one to be caught with
them in his possession, and It was also
decided to ask the Legislature to pass a
bill making it a felony.
Warrant Clerk Peery about a week apo
discovered that there was a section in mo
Penal Code which made it a felony "to
mingle poison with drink with the intent
that the same shall be taken by any hu
man being to his injury." Charles Tur
ner and Herman Isaacs had been arrested
for putting "knockout drops" in a glass
of beer that was to be drunk by a man
whom thev had taken into Lowenthal i'z
Cohen's saloon. 90 Third street, on the
night of November 24.
They were observed by the bartender.
who notified Charles Cohen, one of the
proprietors, and he seized the srlass of
Seer and ordered the men out of the sa
loon. The glass of beer was sent to the
police and t>y them to the City Chemist,
who reported that there were forty grains
of chloral hydrate In the beer, enough to
put several men to sleep. â¢
The preliminary examination of Turner
and Isaacs was held before Judge Fritz
yesterday and he held the defendants to
answer before the Superior Court on the
felony charge In bonds of $2000 each.

GRIGGS ARGUES ON THE CONSTITUTION
ONE of the familiar flgrures of the
Orpheum etage, Frank ,G-. Da
mon, the master .: property '.man,
has passed away." He took cold
last week : Monday, night he ; left
the theater .with the Intention; of
going home to take some medicine; Tues
day night he .was reported .absent, and
on the- sick list; , yesterday the cold de
veloped into pneumonia and last , even-
Ing, at 6:30 he died. - . :
Every 'one who : has been to the. Or
pheum In the last six years knew Damon,
or "Props" as he was called, at least by
sight. He was toe man who came out
aicer a smasH-of crockory and swept up
the piect?s, or cleareu <the stage for the
next part ot the act. He was tali and
lank, and after the gallery, grew to know
him. he received "as much applause for
the manipulation of . his broom as the
vaudeville stars did for tho act?, of which
he and his office were a kind of finale.
And whenever a company came â¢, along
with a sketch or an act and needed' a
third or a fourth or an extra man of any
number he was called upon Â¦ and helped
make up the cast. He was the police
man who arrested the escaping villain;
the butler who carried in the card; the
servant who announced the dinner or who
told the husband of the wife or told the
wife of the husband; or the cabman who
brought the hero home,' or anybody and
everybody who happened to be needed.
And when Damon was not on the stage
he was making . a thunder storm with a
plate of sheetlron or a barrel filled with
rocks; or he was alternating his thunder
bolts with flashes of lightning, or perhaps
was a troop of horses galloping wildly
across. the stage. All these things fell to
him in the line of his duties and he filled
them all with the readiness and aptitude
of a man blessed with the sunniest of
characters.
Damon made a hit of his own a year
ago when he appeared as the down with
Caron and 'Herbert, acrobats, and he
made another as the policeman in the
sketch presented by Rice and John. "He
was always there with his cue," they say
of him. and they mean more than mere
ly that he was on time.
Damon was 27 years old and married,
but he had no children. He lived at 2527
Twenty-third street. He went to the. Or-
pheum from , the Grand, and, he went -to
the latter- house" from the old Grove
street theater, where he was an I usher.
He was born in Maine. At the Orflheum,
where his work behind > the scenes vir
tually began and ended, he was* the
friend ! and comrade of every ' one from
the management down to the call boy.
He was a member of the Theatrical Me- ;
chanlcs* Association No. 21. and the Thea
trical Employes' Protective Union No. 16."
The Mechanics' Association will meet to
day to make arrangements . for the fu
neral. It is probable that the union will
also meet to assist in the ceremonies, and
ring the curtain down, on their old com
rade.

AWARDED A BIG
BRICK CONTRACT
Coast Material.
Tunnels of Bay Shore Road
Will; Be ;Lined With \
San Francisco Brick Company Will
Manufacture Fifty Million
Bricks for the Southern
- Pacific. :
A record-breaking contract has been let
by the Southern- Pacific Company to the
San Fianclsco .Brick Company,; of. which
Gray Brothers are the owners. By" the
terms' of the contract the firm, is to fur
nish to. the' railroad company ; 50,000,000
'bricks,- to be used in lining the tunnels of
the new bay shore-road, to run through
the hills of South San Francisco.
The manufacture of this great number
of bricks is a matter of great moment to
this city,, as they will be the product of a
San Francisco firm, which means the dis
tribution of a 'large 'sum* of money among
this city's, laborers.. ; . â¢
..To. meet this great demand it has been
made necessary to install' an almost en
tirely new. plant, as trie brickmaklng ma
chines- possessed by the firms located In
this city are not of sufficient capacity.
. Heretofore the largest number of bricks
turned Â¦Â¦ out -in : one day has been' 30,000.
With the modern machinery which * is now
being Installed at the works of the San
Francisco Brick , Company 125,000 can be
mado ir. one day. .
? The brick to be. used are known as the
"stiff * mud, wire-cut" variety, and they
are far superior to the "soft mud."
v This is the largest contract ever en
tered Into for the manufacture of brick
not only in this country but in the world.
It will require more than a year to man
ufacture the building material, and to
furnish the brick in this length of time
requires that the full . capacity of the
works be reached daily.
Carey Straw, a discharged soldier, who '
arrived here on the transport Logan from
Manila about two weeks ago, swore to
complaints before Judge Cabanlss yester
day afternoon charging H. Levy, proprie
tor of the Golden. . Gate Tailoring Com
pany, 1470 Market street; F. L. Heywoods,
an agent for the company, and "John
Doe." an employe of the company, with
grand larceny.
Straw belongs to "Xlork County, Pennsyl
vania, and while at the, Presidio he says
he was approached by an agent of the
Golden Gate Company, who took him in a
buggy to i their establishment on Market
street, where- he was torced to buy a suit
of clothes, but as he was unable to pay
for the suit they took possession of his
discbarge papers and his railroad ticket
to Pennsylvania, which cost him $58.
Straw complained to the police yester
day and Detective Cody was detailed to
interview the tailoring company. He did
so and the members admitted that they
had the ticket and discharge, but refused
to give them up till paid for the suit.-
Straw also complained that a man
known as "Judge," who Tiaunts the Pre
sidio, took him downtown Monday and
when he woke up next morning all his
money was gone. He had . $160 when he
started out Monday morning. The police
will endeavor to locate "Judge."

CALIFOENIA-TS IN WASHINGTON
1H;OR the States bordering upon the Great Lakes
I -~and for those between the lakes and. the sea the
recent report of the deep waterway commission
is as interesting as the report of the commissiQn on
the isthmian canal. There has long been a ''desire -for
a deep canal from the lakes to the ocean, and the com
mittee reports that the enterprise is feasible.
There are now canals oh the upper lakes giving
a twenty-foot channel from Duluth to Buffalo..* The
Erie canal, connecting the lakes with the; Hudson, is
insufficient for the inci easing traffic, and so the com
mittee recommends a canal from Lake Erie to 'Lake
Ontario, via Lasalle and Lewiston, and. then from
Lake Ontario to the Hudson River, via Oswego and
the Mohawk Valley.
The report contemplates either a twenty-foot or a
thirty-foot channel; but if the work be undertaken it
is safe *to say the deeper channel 'will be~ adopted.
When constructed the canals,, with the lake and the
rivers, will give throilgh the territory of the United
States a deep waterway 'by which "'the largest vessels
may pass from the ocean through to the lakes, and
all the lake cities will be virtually seaports.
.. 7 he enterprise is a big one and will cost a lot of
money. It is estimated that to provide thirty-foot
channels through all the. canals 'on the route from
New York to Duluth Will \cost $317,000,000. The
United States could do a greaVdeal with that sum of
money in the way of redeeming the arid /lands Vpf'the
Great West and conserving, .'the! forests of the whole
country. Consequently the work is not going to be
undertaken without mature consideration of the ques
tion whether there is not other work for the Govern
ment of more pressing urgency than furnishing a ship
canal that will benefit only one section of the country.
The fact that Canada is preparing for the construc
tion of a deep' waterway through her\efritory may
induce many persons to favor the construction of one.
through our territory. We are not likely to have war.
with Great Britain, but nevertheless few Americans
would like to see the British' in possession of an â¢ open
way from the ocean to the lakes while , we have none.
The opening of a deep waterway either through
Canada or theVUnited States will-make a tremendous
economic change in the conditions of the whole lake
region. The 'grain traffic of the lakes is already; enor
mous, and of recent years there has been also an'im
mense traffic in iron Â¦ 01 e; coal and :; other â¢products! At
the present time shipments from the lake â¢States; in-'
ten'de'd for â¢ Europe go down to New .York, and fare Â¦

It is not too much to expect something of the same
kind will happen in San Francisco if we can onre
get a great library fairly launched. It is therefore grat
ifying that the first step has been : made. A general
movement on the part of the city and the citizens to
provide San Francisco with a magnificent library and
e building of a monumental character would be a good
enterprise with which to start the new century;
It is to be noted in this connection that the Ameri
can people like big things, and will strain themselves
to advance a great enterprise when they would hardly
give fc thought to a little one. So long as the Astor,
Lenoa and Tilden libraries were separate the people
of New York did little or nothing to promote them.
The moment they were united the whole community
took an interest in them. The city voted a magnificent
site for a building and also a liberal appropriation.
Private citizens came forward with contributions,
and so the great work augmented like a rolling snow
ball until it has reached its present magnitude, and
the end is not yet. . .
Since in an old city like New York the conserva
tism that held the Lerox, Astor, and .Tilden libraries
separate for sentimental reasons has been overcome
and a vigorous new movement started which willgiv
the city library facilities superior to any other city in
the world, it is not too much to expect that in a youqg
city like San Francisco a s itnilar movement once
started would soon increase in power and extent an i
go forward until this city also has a library of the first
magnitude.
Xew York, however, is not content with effecting
the union of the three foundations named. Efforts
_re now being made to bring the New York Free
Circulating Library into the combination. The Cir
culating Library has eleven buildings in different parts
of the city, and its property as a whole is valued at
$700,000. That in itself will be a magnificent addi
tion to the great library of the city, but that is not all.
The plans of consplidation include co-operation be
tvi-een the library and the schools which have branch
libraries, so that when all has been perfected New
York will have a library S3 r stem so comprehensive that
it will supply the needs of all classes of people from
school-children up.
In the movement toward consolidation the trustees
of the various libraries in San Francisco will find a
good example to emulate "and to follow in what has
been accomplished by the managers of libraries in
New York. Xot long ago New York was in a con
dition not dissimilar to that which exists in San
Francisco. There were several excellent libraries, but
no one of them was of first rank. The trustees recog
nized that much better work could be done by con
solidation than by separate effort, and accordingly a
pian was devised to bring the Astor, Lenox and Til
den foundations together. The moment so g-eat a
library wa? in sight the whole community took an
interest in it. Steps .were taken to provide a struc
ture suitable for it, and now New York is to have a
library building' which will surpass the noted one at
Boston and perhaps even the monumental structure
a*. Washington, which at present is the finest library
building in the world.
AT the meeting of the trustees of the Mechanics"
Institute on Tuesday evening an arrangement
was made by which the Philatelic Society be
comes affiliated with the Mechanics' Library; to the
advantage of the members of both -organizations. It
is further reported that this is the first step;to\vard
the accomplishment of a comprehensive plan by which
various other literary, professional, scientific and- art
societies are to be united with the institute. It thus
appears that the movement toward the consolidation
of libraries in this city is fairly under way. and that
...
we may soon have in existence a library equal to the
needs of our people and worthy of the city.

Upon this . showing the reform movement in Ne-v
York must begin with a demand for latch keys. Until
the. respectable married man can attend to his political
"duties without a domestic disturbance every. time he
goes to a ward meeting at night the city will -be badly
governed. ; Most married men would rather let Tam
many rule the roost than to have a fight for liberty at
home. Either, then, there must be a latch key for the
lord of the house or else arrangements must be made
to provide seats for ladies at all political meetings
and elections. That is the situation, and the simple
statement ofit shows how. cruel Mark Twain was in
taunting his hosts. for, neglect of; civic duties.
Such being the situation the sensitive citizens of the
metropolis have been looking about for excuses and
have found one. It hasbeen stated that after allthc
rule of Tammany is due mainly to the married women
of the city. It. appears that the wife of nearly every
good citizen objects to his going out at night unless
he takes her. along. Of course men cannot take their
wives to mass meetings and primary elections, and so
they do not attend such things. 'The consequence is
that New York is run*by bachelors and by men whose
wives would rather have them" out of the house than
The commendation did not make the dignitaries at
the banquet very happy. The halo didn't fit. All New
York Has been talking ever since the election of tha
need of reform and each man has been eager for all
other men to perform their civic duty. Consequently
any sarcasm IikVtlut of the humorous Mr. Twain
seemed a little.more stinging than it would, have been
at any /other time. The New Yorkers are aware that
Tammany. gives them the best government they de
serve, for if they deserved better they would long ago
have overthrown Tammany and established a decent
administration.
SOME days ago Mark Twain in addressing the
St. Nicholas Society in New York said: "Gen
tlemen, you have the best municipal govern
ment in the world; the purest and the most fragrant.
The very angels envy you and wish they could estab
lish a government like it in heaven. You got it by
noble fidelity to civievduty/'

JOHN. D. ROCKEFELLER has given so many
millions to the University of Chicago, and his
.gifts have followed one another so rapidly, that
they have ceased: to attract much attention from the
general public. In. fact; a donation*_of a million or two
from the founder to the university, is a sort of annual
event and is passed ovcr^vith comparative indifference
ai one of the things^&'at*everybody expected.
The gift will serve/, however, to recall to public at
tention at the close- of the century how much the
American people are indebted to . rich,:men for a!i
manner of liberal gifts." Rockefeller's donation is not
going to stand alone at the closing" of the century.
Recent reports announced that Yale expects to. have
a million added to her endowment fund within a short
I time, ' and other : universities are to be the recipients
I of gifts hardly, less^large. ' â¢- "
It is to be noted, that ; in,announcing the ;gift Presi
dent Harper took occasion to -say: ''Whatever may
have happened in other universities, in the University
oi Chicago neither the trustees nor the president; nor
any one in official position, has at any time called an
irstructor to account for any public utterances which
he may.have made. In order not to be misunderstood
I wish to say that no donor of funds to the university
â and I include in the number of donors the founder
of the university, Mr- Rockefeller â has ever by a
single word or'act indicated his dissatisfaction with the
instruction given to^ the students of the university or
with the public expression of opinion made by an of
ficer of the university. I vouch for the truth of this
statement, and I trust it may have^ the largest possible
publicity." Â¦
It is gratifying to have that positive statement from
Dr. Harper. There is no doubt that the Ameri
can people have become very sensitive upon the sub
ject of .the domination of universities by great capi
talists. Such domination, if it were exercised to even
a fraction of the extent reported, would be a serious
evil to the nation. Fortunately there are assurances
forthcoming that it dees not exist. As a rule our
liberal millionaires have made their gifts to educa
tional institutions for the purpose of advancing knowl
edge and not with the intent of propagating any
dogmas of their own. Chicago University is to be
congratulated upon the magnificent gift that comes
to her without imposing a single restraint upon her
intellectual freedom.

The country will await the decision with high ex
pectation, and when tendered. the future will be seeji
in a clearer atmosphere.
The great issue raised can, be settled only by the
Supreme Court. It cannot be adjusted by ballots,
nor made the play of shifting party politics. The
Porto Ricans and Filipinos cannot be citizens by the
result of Ojfie election and returned to alienage by the
adverse result of the next. That would mean chaos,
against which the constitution distinctly canonizes.
v On the other hand is the tenable contention that the
supreme law of the land cannot be at war with itself,
and that one set of rights may be conferred by the
constitution but denied by a treaty] ,:'>.-,
The greatest intellects of this country and Europe
have regarded the constitution as one of the most in
teresting studies involved in the science of,govern
ment. Its phrasing, punctuation, the arrangement of
its clauses, the effect of one upon another and upon
all, and of all upon one, when studied have shown
that it contains nothing meaningless. Throughout its
structure, everywhere, meaning and purpose are ap
parent. From this view of. it lawyers and laymen,
Judges and students, may well inquire why section 2
at article VI was not made to read: "This constitu
tion, and the laws of the_United States, and all trea
ties made or which shall be- made, in pursuance
thereof, under authority of the United States, shall be
the supreme law of the land.". That would have left
it clear that the intention of the makers of the con
stitution was that all treaties, as well as all laws, must
conform to the constitution.
If it be held to apply only to the precedent, a de
cision to that effect wins the case of the Government;
otherwise that case fails.
The limiting and qualifying phrase, "in pursuance
thereof," unquestionably applies to what precedes it,
to the laws of the United States, but does it also
apply to "all treaties made or which shall be "made"?
Does it limit the antecedent clause as well as the
This raises the question of the constitutional char
acter of a treat}'. Must it, like a law of Congress, con
form to the constitution? The constitution itself (ar
ticle VI, section 2) uses peculiar phraseology: "This
constitution, and the laws of the United States which
shall be made in pursuance thereof, an\i all treaties
made, or which shall be made, under authority of the
United States, shall be the supreme law of the land."
The opening argument of Attorney General Griggs,
in the case now being heard, will disclose an 'issue
which we believe has not heretofore been the subject
of a judicial decision. He said: "It was the inten
tion of the treaty of Paris not to make the ceded
islands a part of the United States, and not to make
the inhabitants of those islands citizens."* 1
We regard it as, the settled conviction of a majority
of the American people that the many millions' of peo
ple brought under our jurisdiction by the treaty of
Paris shall not become citizens arid, as such, be incor
pr.ic.ted in the American Union. â¢ If the court decide
that they arcjto._be so incorporated, two courses are
open, either of which may be taken. The constitution
ma}- be amended so as to hold the territory acquired,
govern it by such principles and administer it by such
policy as the amendment may declare, or the territory
and the people may be thrust outside of our jurisdic
tion and, under our tutelage, exercised to the same
extent as in Cuba, be made responsible for their own
government in a condition of independence.
The expansive results of the Spanish war have put
upon the country burdens and responsibilities that
have to be borne or gotten rid of: or, if their con
tinuance under the constitution require administra
tion incompatible at once with '.that instrument and
the interests of the country, it may be amended to
conformity with both. '
THE COURT AND THE COLONIES:
THE Dred Scott decision was an - epoch-making
act, of the Supreme Court of the United States.
While it was both misrepresented and misunder
stood, and was unpopular in the North, it was the
most searching judicial discussion of the constitution
that had occurred in our history. As affecting the
case it decided it was obsoleted by the Civil War, but
this had to be done by the thirteenth, fourteenth and
fifteenth amendments, which imported into the con
stitution principles that were not in existence when the
decision was rendered. Therefore it stands as a Valid
interpretation of constitutional principles as they were
fixed in the original instrument. Since that great de
cision was , rendered no issue before the court has
equaled the one then joined, until now.

READY TO TAKE
MISSION ROCK
But a Bombardment and
Assault by Marines Is
Averted.
There was an air of feverish -unrest at
Mare Island yesterday morning when
Naval Lieutenant, A. F. Fechteler took
the steamer for San Francisco. Although
the_outslde world was ignorant of the
fact, Lieutenant Fechteler and his admir
ing messmates had news of grave im
port from the Secretary of the Navy and
Lieutenant Fechteler had been made
happy by having the honor of executing
the order of the Secretary. ,
The young lieutenant was bound on the
important mission of capturing Mission
Rock, in the bay of San. Francisco, and
hoisting thereon the stars and stripes.
Such was the gist of the order received by
the naval authorities yesterday morning
from Washington. Had It not been for
a little proviso in the telegraphed order
the brave lieutenant might have taken a
gunboat and a battalion of marines and
stormed the California Drydock Ware
houses -without any preliminary skirmish
ing. That proviso was the direction to
consult with United States Attorney
Frank L. Coombs before resorting to
bombardment or other violent measures.
United States District Judge Beatty of
Idaho a few days ago handed down a de
cision to the effect that the California
Drydock Company had no valid title to
Mission Hock and that the rock and the
tide lands surrounding It were the-prop
erty of the United States.
When Lieutenant Fechteler called upon
Mr. Coombs he was Informed that, al
though the opinion of Judge â¢ Beatty had
been received, the judgment had not then
been recorded and the drydock company
would be allowed the statutory time in
which to file an appeal. Pending the de
termination of the appeal, said Mr.
Coombs, the property would remain In
the hands of the present owners.
There was great disappointment at
Mare Island, when the lieutenant tele
graphed from this city that the services
of the gunboat wpuld not be required and
that the marines -would not be given a
chance to distinguish themselves.
The drydock company does not Intend to
relinquish this valuable piece of prop
erty without a hard legal struggle. The
rock, or rocks, for there are two of them,
were acquired by parties who purchased
the tide lands surrounding them from
the State of California, and the drydock
people bought them and expended $300,
000 In filling in around the rocks and
building warehouses upon nearly fourteen
acres of made ground. They are pre
paring: papers on appeal to the United
States Circuit Court and will g-o thence,
If necessary, to the United States Su
preme Court. ,

MRS. THOMAS THORNHILL,
GRAfcD ARCH DRUIDESS FOR
GRAND CIRCLE.
J. J. Griffith, who lives at 31S6 Sixteenth
I street, believes that he has been swindled
I out of a considerable sum of money. He
| paid It to a man who said that his name
! was Walter Selby and who claimed to be
; connected with the local smelter people
Â¦ of that name. The money was paid on
! the representations of the man who re
: ceived It that he would deUver to Mr.
| Griffith a half interest in a 'deiwslt of
gravel in the Samoan Islands rich in gold.
; According to the story told to Mr. Griffith,
; the schooner Helen S. Klmball, was to.
1 brlr.g up a cargo of the gravel next
! month. Several facts of later develop
: ment have jarred Mr. Griffith's confidence.
; The Selbys have disclaimed any connec
i tion with the person who has claimed to
: be Walter Selby. The schooner Helen S.
Kimball is under charter to J. Wightman
Jr. and will bring up only copra and co
coanut^. Moreover, since Mr. Griffith
: purchased his alleged gold gravel he has
not been able to find the man who sold it
j to him. Last evening' he said, "There is
. no doubt that 1 have oeen hocus pocused."
The story about shiploads of gravel to
'Â¦ be brought to this port from islands in
the Pacinc was first tieard some time ago.
' Then a shipload was to come from Hono
lulu, and currency was given to a. state
ment thai the tSelbys had assayed some
of it and had reported that it was worth
; J1(XÂ» per ton anil that Walter Selby had an
' interest in the gravel claims. No ship
j ever arrived with any such cargo, aev
' eral persons went to the Selbys to inquire
; into the matter.
, An agent was sent to Portland. Or., to
hnd Walter Selby. His letter heads gave
i an address tor his Portland assay oiflce.
! When tills was run down the place was
found to be a lodging house. A man was
there who was ill. He told the agent that
: he had a laboratory at a certain place in
; Portland. This proved to be faise. He
; also told the agent he was connected with
the San Francisco Selbys. The address
; he gave for their San Francisco offices
: correspond to the Nevada block. These
, facts being- communicated to inquirers
I they unanimously denied that they had
! invested any money with Walter Selby,
! but each one claimed to have a half inter
! est in &. gravel deposit in the Hawaiian
t Islands that they rad secured from this
: man.
Each of these parties had a copy of a
I letter sent out by the Selby Smelting and
| Laad Company to a man In SisKlyou
County, reporting- an assay of gravel that
' he had sent from Northern California.
j The interest in the case was increased by
j the fact that the purchasers of supposed
; gold gravel deposits in the Hawaiian Isl
j ands had been told by Walter Selby that
this report applied to Hawaii.
The next story was that a gold gravel
deposit had been discovered by Walter
Selby in Samoa. This is the story that
lured Griffith. He at first denied that he
had Invested any money, but acknowl
edged it when it was pointed out that he
could not have believed that any stranger
would give him half a cargo of gold-bear
ing gravel. Undoubtedly the other pur
chasers who have kept their names secret
also paid and a large sum in the aggre
: gate has been invested in this way. Sev
eral persons are anxious to find Walter
Selby, biK cannot. He has no address in

Joy reigns in the hearts of the hun
dreds of the little tots who attend the kin
dergartens of the Golden Gate Associa
tion, for yesterday morning Santa Claus
commenced to visit the schools, and will
continue to do so until to-morrow.
The motto of the association Is "The
hope of the world lies in the children," and
after visiting- the kindergartens, yester
day, one could not but be Impressed with
the noble work carried on by the ladles In
charge of the organization.
For many days the children, who rantre
from two years to five, have been on the
keen edge of expectation, for their teach
ers had told them that dear old Santa
Claus would pay each one a visit, and his
arrival yesterday was greeted with shrill
shouts and peais of merriment.
The exercises were arranged by the
principals of the schools, and the gifts
were donated by the .ladies forming the
board of managers, visitors and ofneers.
- In each of the kindergartens a big
Christmas tree was erected early in the
day, and the teachers, aided by the visi
tors, dressed the branches with the pres
ents for the little ones. There were toys
of all kinds hanging from the branches
of the trees and boxes of candy were piled
In tempting array at the foot of each
tree.
The exercises were similar in each kin
dergarten. The children, with their moth
ers, assembled at the appointed hour,, and
the little ones, after singing a number
of songs, gathered around the trees and
received the gifts from the teachers.
In order that the officers and visitors of
the association might be present at each
distribution of the gifts, the exercises
have been arranged to cover three dayB.
Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock the chil
dren of the Stanford Memorial kinder

took place at the Pope, Emily P. Walker,

The work of . the Golden Gate Kinder
gartenVAssociation is supported solely
by voluntary contributions and has been
carried â¢ on for twenty-one years. No
assistance, is asked from the municipal
government and it is a work of charity
with.the ladles who are in control. Hun
dreds of little ones are brought under the
Influence of the kindergartens each year
and prepared for the public schools. But
for the existence of the . kindergartens
the children would be neglected, as in
most cases their, parents are too Ignorant
or Indolent to give their offspring the
slightest mental training. The mothers
of the children are also induced to attend
the kindergartens, where they are taught
many useful accomplishments by the
teachers. -
Next Monday at 2 p. m. the ladies of the
San Francisco Nursery â¢ for Homeless
Children will entertain the little ones un
der their care with a Christmas tree. . A
bountiful supply of toys and candy will be
distributed and the ladies of the nursery
extend an invitation to their friends to be
present. The nursery is located at 1534
Mission street. ,

KRIS KRINGLE
MAKES TOTS GLAD
Collector Stratton has had Dr. Kinyoun
on the carpet and received -hl3 explana
tions as to the necessity for these and
other disagreeable and seemingly unnec
essary restrictions upon commerce, and
the Collector mailed his report to Wash
ington yesterday. What his recom
mendation in the matter is, Mr. Stratton
declines to say, but there Is a well au
thenticated report around the Custom
house that the California delegation will
ask the authorities to transfer Dr. Kin
youn to some port as far away from San
Francisco as possible.
J. E. Bennett of counsel for the Chinese
Six Companies is preparing papers . for a
suit against the Quarantine Officer on be
half of ChinesÂ© consignees of the goods
held upon the Coptic by the doctor's
orders.
The latest complaint la regarding: an
order made by Kinyoun in the matter of
the steamship Coptic on her arrival from
Chinese ports on the 14th of the present
month. The order recites that the ves
sel is . entitled to free pratique ''with ex
ceptions that all dried fish and oysters
and dried meats and vegetables from
Hongkong are not to be taken off the ves
sel unless on special certificates, and all
Chinese and Japanese food stuffs, such as
yams, water chestnuts, lily bulbs, sugar
cane, green ginger, bamboo shoots and
taro, to be allowed to be landed only upon
such certificates."
Complaints have been madÂ© to Customs
Collector Stratton concerning the un
popular manner In which Federal Quar
antine Officer Kinyoun Is discharging thÂ«
duties of his office. These complaints
are from merchants and shippers gener
ally and are to the effect that Kinyoun
has" injured the commerce of this port
materially by sending to Washington re
ports of bubonic plague at this port, when
In- fact there never has been any plague
of any kind in this city during the in
cumbency of Kinyoun.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 19.â It it learned
that the entire misunderstanding which
has delayed the consummation of the
agreement at Peking was caused by the
change or omission of the single digit in
a complex Â¦ group of figures making up
one of the cipher messages of instruction
to Mr. Conger. Curiously enough the
change in this single. digit reversed thj
meaning of the entire message ao that
Mr. Conger In opposing the English view
was acting exactly contrary to the spirit
of his Instructions, though in accordance
with their letter.
PEKING, Dec. 19.â At a meeting gf the

also brought along, conspicuous among
the pieces being a collection of sporting
guns, which Sloan will have use for dur

As the famous Jockey eat in the grill
room taking dinner with his friends he
was the cynosure of all eyes, and it was
generally commented on that he looked
pale and haggard, although he was at
tired in the latest fashion.
When asked as to his reported suspen

Sloan paid:
"It is not true that I have been ruled off
the turf by the English Jockey Club and,
in fact, I have never received any notlfl

action against me. A lot of stuff has been
published in the papers of this, country
which is absolutely false.
"As a matter of fact, I am at liberty to

date of December JO that an epidemic of
typhoid and imeumonla Is prevalent in
Daweon and several new cases were re
ported. Both St. Mary's and the Good

patients. There have been twelve
deaths reported during the past week an4
many persons ar<* now at death's door.
Major Z. C. Wood, commanding the

Their cases are not dangerous.
Plans have been laid before the Yukon
Council for a streetcar service which is
to run through the main streets of Daw
eon and out to the creeks. The establish
ment of this service will mean the ex
penditure of $1,000,000. The Council favor*
the appropriation. The. Alaska Commer
cial Company proposes to establish a boot
building plant and machine- shops at Daw
eon.
bawson advices received by the Skag

clever capture of the Epsom
Handicap by Green Morris*
â¢brave" Locochee. It was hardly expected
after his rather unpronounced showing at
Oakland en December 12, and the massa
cre of whites who had backed Campus,
was eomethlnp fr'ghlfuL The distance
â¢was cne milo and a half, and Campus
ruled an S to 5 choice. Koenig. which ran
a dead heat with Campus, waÂ» for some
unknown leason peddled about In the ring,
ay an itinerant huckster would wild game
on Monday morning. Over the heavy
track Campus ?-nd Lavator had the race
to themsc ives for a mile, then both grace
fully retired. Topmast, which was blown
away on December 17 wnen piloted by
Johnny Woods, then took up the running.
His stay was phort, for Winnie O'Connor
came with a deal of noise and bustle on
Locochee. and the chestnut won like a
good "Injin." Topmast ran second. Lava
tor a fair third. Campus an awful fourth
and Koenig a horrible fifth*
Two favorites peeped In, Lomo and
Cousin Carrie. The downfall of four oth
ers was the cause of much rejoicing
amonp the layer Â» of odds.
The las=t event on the card, a sevem
furlong purse run, really could claim some
pretensions to class, for in it started Sam
Fallen. Montanlc. Prejudice, Scales and
Tuthill. Montanlc opened favorite, with
O'Connor up, was cherry ripe for a car
ridp and never cut any figure in the run
ring. Sam Fulkn did ragtime steps out
before the footlights for a time, and then
ducked behind the scenes. Pat Dunne's
Bcales was apparently the best, but Char
ley Gray, who has not been up In the
Â¦addle for some time, made botchy work
of it. and lo.<t to Tuthill by a neck. The
winner had Kilcy up, and closed at odds
of 10 to 1.
"Monk " Ccburn's ride on Opponent, the
even money favorite for the opening mile
pplllnp race, was simply disgraceful. The
horse looked a sweet 3 to 5 chance. Btill
several books In the ring laid even money
till the bugle blew. With no pace 6et,
Coburn kept bis mount out of the run
ning to the stretch, then rode all over
th*> track, finally finishing third. McXam
ara. the second choice, experienced little
difficulty in beating out Hohenlohe a
Ifnglh.
King's Pal. at Â£3 and 25 to 1, defeated a
lot of maidens for the second number, a
nix furlons dash. He ran unbacked by
his stable, and in a drive earned the de
cision over Sam Howard by a nose. Hon
durcn. the favorite, was third.
At one time it iookod as if Can't Dance

LOCOCHEE ON THE WARPATH ONCE
MORE, CARRIES AWAY THE EPSOM
Defeats Campus, Koenig and Others for the Handieap at
Tanforanâ Tuthill Leaves a Good Field Behind.-
"I am out here Just to visit some friends
and have some shooting 1 , and though I un
derstand that the California Jockey Club
has decided that I cannot ride on Its
track, I want to say that long before It
took that step it knew that I would not
ride here this season, and no amount of
money would Induce me to cross a mount.
"I intend to return to England in April
and ask the Jockey Club tor a rehearing
of my case. I am confident that I win be
able to amply vindicate myself. When I
first rode In England I was treated well
by the Jockeys and the public, and so
were the other American riders. When,
however, we demonstrated our superiority
the English Jockeys at once showed thu
most Jealous feeling 1 , and then the public
fell right In line.
"If I find that I cannot secure a license
next year In England I shall ride In thU
country and In France. A refusal of a
license does not bar me off any track
other than the tracks governed by the
club making the refusal. But. as I said
before, I Intend returning; to England and
feel perfectly confident that the English
Jockey Club will give me a rehearing and
a chance to vindicate myself.
"Yes. It Is true that I was negotiating
to tide for the Prince of "Wales during the
coming season, but owing to so much
publicity of the charges made against mo
and other American riders the negotia
tions were abruptly ended."
Sloan will remain in the city for a few
days and then join e party of friends for
a week's shooting In the country. .
I know of any action that body contem
plates I learned from the racing: calendar
of England, which had a semi-official an
nouncement that I need not apply for* a
license next year.
JOCKEY SLOAN IS IN THE CITY
BUT HE WILL ACCEPT NO MOUNTS
He Diseusses His Recent Trouble in England and Says That
He Will Return to Vindicate Himself.

J. H. Perigo'e Lady Davenport captured
the midweek reserve stake at Union Park
yesterday. As a bread-winner the Lady
has done her share this week for her
kennels. On Sunday Jaet she got first
money in the stake at San Jose Coursing
Park, taking the flag from Jolly Rover in
the deciding course. On account of the
hard condition of the field In the Garden
City grounds many who were aware' of
her victory thought that the going would
leave her feet In bad shape, and In conse
quence did not figure the Lady to go the
route. She wa3 out to win, however, and,
while she was fortunate In getting two
byes, still she went to her work In quick,
snappy style. Fin McCool and tPalm
flower were unable to score a point
against the Lady; and May'Hempstead,
who. led her. until the. close to the hare,
fared aa badly. In the final Minnie Wa
Wa was on the short end of the score 9
to 5, Gazabo, the hare with a history,
refused .to let, either of the contestants
Add a kill to. the record, and ; made good
his escape.
A dozen short-ends landed, the sensation
of the day being the upsets of the favor
ites, Los Angeles and Royal Annie, at 6
and 7 to 1 respectively by The Owl, the
ecore being 3 to 2 In each event.
The Owl is a litter sister of King Cash
ier, a youngster of promise, and while In
yesterday's stake she was slow on the
run-up, her work on the hare was good.
Minnie Wa Wa, the runner-up, showed
determination in her courses and out
worked Admiral Sampson and Warpath,
both favorites.
ThornhiU. a ence great performer, was
beaten easily, in the run-down by Real
Lassie.
R. E. de B. Lopez's youngster Eager
showed up well, beating Daylight on the
short end and leading" St. Helen close up
to the hare. He is a litter brother of
Ruby R and of Whltehead by a later lit
ter.
The day's results, with Judge John
Grace's official scores fdllow:
The Owl Furnishes Day's Sensation,
Beating the Favorites, Los An
geles and Royal Anne, at
Good Odds.

Trouble on Sprlngburn.
The British ship Sprlngburn, that went
to 6ea yesterday, had a baker's dozen of
her crew in irons for several days before
she left port. During last Friday's gale
the ehlp began to drag and the mate at
once piped all hands on deck. The men
were very slow in answering the sum
mons, and were called a "lot of old
women" by the officer. This epithet they
objected to, and demanded to be set
ashore. Instead they were put In irons
and locked up In the brig. Four days of
bread and water was enough for the gang,
and yesterday they turned to.* and one of
the merriest "chanties" ever heard in the
bay was sung as they hauled in tho an
chor.
"Water Front Notes.
Captain I. Martin left for New Orleans
last night. He is going to bring out a big
four-masted schooner for Byxbee & Clark.
The same firm has purchased a flve
masted schooner In Thomaston, Me., and
a man has gone East to Inspect her.
Should the Inspection be satisfactory the
big schooner will come to California.
Johnny O'Brien ran up against a cir
cular saw In a box factory yesterday and
his hand was badly cut. Dr. Bactgalupi
fixed him up at the Harbor Hospital and
sent him home. -
The Harbor Commissioners held a short
session yesterday. The monthly bills were
all passed, and the chances are "theboys"
will get their pay before Xmas. Chief
Wharfinger Henderson made a protest
against loose telephone wires being al

Mr. Kennedy asked the witness if any
attempt had been made to combine all the
American locomotive works. Mr. Con
verse answered In the affirmative, but
said the effort was unsuccessful. His
firm opposed the project, and he did not
believe locomotives could be built at a
lower cost. If such an idea were carried
out.
As to the question of epeed, Mr. Con
verse stated that the substitution of Bteel
rails for iron permitted an Increase of
weight in engines, which resulted in fur
ther speed.
The increase in speed and capacity haa
brought about a reduction in the cost of
transportation and operating.
Regarding tariff conditions, Mr. Con
verse said that owing to -the Government
ownership system existing in most for
eign countries no difficulty was ever en
countered In that respect. The industry,
he said, was at present more prosperous
than at any time from 1S93 to 1837.
Mr. Converse said he believed this fact
to be due to the Industry and intelligence
of the American workman and the much
larger use of Improved machinery here
than abroad.
"In that case." eaid Chairman Clarke,
"how can you produce locomotives at less
coat than the foreign product?"
In answer to a question by Chairman
Clarke, Mr. Converse said the wages of thÂ©
firm's employes are higher than those paid
abroad.
Mr. Converse gave as reasons for intro
ducing American locomotives abroad the
possibility of earlier delivery, preference
for American locomotives as to type and
detail and the question of prices. Engines
have been constructed, witness said, at
less cost per unit of weight than the ordi
nary foreign locomotives.
The foreign trade in locomotives, he
said, has been a steady growth for the
last forty years. At first it was confined
to Cuba and South America, but in the
last twenty-five years It has extended to
the Eastern hemisphere.
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 19.â John H.
Converse, a membervof the firm of Burn
ham. Williams & Co., which controls the
Baldwin Locomotive Works, appeared be
fore the Industrial Commission to-day.
He stated that the industry was estrb
lished in 1X31, and has constantly and
steadily grown, until to-day the works
are the largest In the world. The capacity
of the plant is 1200 locomotives a year, or
practically four locomotives for each
working- day. The capital employed Mr.
Converse estimated at not less than $1J.
000,000. About feOOO hands are engaged at
the works.

word cf opposition or even of comment,
the Senate passed the resolution authorlt
::.Â£ Boutelle's retirement. It la expected
that the President will approve the reso
.uuon and in accordance with the author
ization name him as a captain on the re

Â»na the passing of seventy-one private

The House to-day, at the end of a spir

passed bills compelling the Pennsylvania

Cii-uee. At. amendment was placed upon
the Pennsylvania bill to compel the road

JvVXJJL
Byron, somewhere in "Childe Harold's
Pilgrimage," declares that "the beings of
the mind, essentially immortal, create and
multiply In us a brighter. and more be
loved existence." According to some such
principle Maeterlinck might justify the
use he makes of certain of Shakespeare's
characters in producing most subtle and
profound dramatic effects. Maeterlinck
has 'been called "The Belgian Shakes
peare," not that he Is comparable with
Shakespeare in respect of power and
majesty, but simply that he employs for
dramatic purposes the associations that
have grown up In the world's mind about
the characters and plays of Shakespeare.
As one reads certain of Maeterlinck's
plays an incident of the older playwright
is called to mind, and then a character
that is reminiscent of another play, and
as these associations, fugitive p-nd dis
tant, accumulate It 13 discovered that
Maeterlinck Is depending for his dramatic
effects upon the memory of the reader and.
his familiarity, more or less Intimate,
with the stage property of the older
dramatist. Maeterlinck merely says: "I
am trying to write Shakespeare for a the
ater of marionettes." By this he may be
understood to mean that he is not trying
to imitate the grand action of the Shakes
pearean stage, but that he Is simply tak
ing advantage of tho residual conscious
ness of Shakespeare existing in the mind
of the present generation after forgetful
ness has done its part and so gives us
Shakespeare reduced to more Impalpable
substance, substance rcflned to atmos
phere, substantial fact become associa
tion of ideas. In place of the splendid
objective life which energizes the stage
of Shakespeare there appears in Maeter
linck the subjective- subtlelzed results of
action. Upon the latter stage things are
realized more by suggestion than by im
pression.
To illustrate this modern usage â an ex
periment in dramatic effects never before
attemptedâ one of Maeterlinck's plays en
titled "Princess Maleine" may bepassedln
review. In this play the dependency upon
association Is very marked and. Indeed,
the recollection of Shakespeare is a very
part of the play's organization. It in
volves the memory of so many of the
great playwright's characters that there
is some justification for the satirical com
ment of Nordau that " "Princess Malelne"
Is a Shakespeare anthology for Patago
nlans." '
"Princess Maleine" describee the plot
ting of Anne, the Queen of Jutland, to
possess for her daushter the throne of
Holland. Becoming tha paramour of King
Hjalmar, she creates an atmosphere uf
intrigue and suspicion in the whole court,
and under such conditions the play is con
ducted. Anne first wins the consent of
the King to the marriage of his son.
Prince Hjalmar, to her daughter, Princess
Uglyayne. But the Prince is already be
trothed to -Princess Maleine, daughter of
Marcdlus, King of a portion of Holland.
In order to effect her will Anne Insti
gates war between the two Kings, which
results in the defeat of Marcellus and the
consequent breaking of the engagement
between the Prince and Maleine. The lat
ter, accompanied only by her nurse. Is con
fined in a towerâ a tower In which once
a Duchess dwelt who "loved a Prince they
would not let her love"â but escaping
from the prison house Maleine Is enabled
to enter the palace of HJalmar as a serv
ing maid. Here the opportunity Is given
her to meet with Prince Hjalmar and
the.lr.Xxo.th.Js renewed. Anne, foreseeing
"the failure of her plots and finding poi
son too slow in action, persuades the weak
King to tho murder of the Princess. Ma
leine is strangled In her bedroom at night.
Prince Hjalmar. on discovering .he mur
derers, kills Anne and at once turns the
dagger against himself, leaving the old
King raving in madness.
The different scenes of the play are laid
in storms. At the beginning the peace of
tho nations Is threatened by the appear
ance of a comet and of showers of stars.
Terrible storms rage at intervals. The
sky Is as "black as the pooL" Strange
fires hover over the palace. Cocks crow
suddenly, crows croak, swans fly across
the sight. At the height of the tragedy
such a storm rages that it seems like the
break-up of the last day. The moon Is
then in eclipse. The very elements share
In the tragic action. .
Act 1 contains the incident of the rup
ture between the two Kings and the sub
sequent warfare, the burning of the city
and palace of Marcellus, and the im
prisonment and escape of Maleine and the
nurse. When King Hjalmar breaks from
the palace of Marcellus, where he has
been entertained, he turns in rage upon
his rival, while the shower of stars con
tinues and the comet gleams above the
palace: "Ignoble Marcellus! You have
dpne a monstrous thing to-day. Come,
my horses, my horses! I am going! I
am going! I am going! And I leave you
your Maleine, with her green face and her
white eyelashes! And I leave you with
your old Qodellva, But wait! You shall
go on your knees across the marshes.
And I shall come to celebrate your be
trothal with all my halberdiers and all
the ravens In Holland for the funeral
feast. Let us be gone! We shall meet
again. Ha! Ha! Ha!" With this overt
act of defiance the tragic conflict of the
play begins.
In act 2 Maleine Journeys to the city of
Hjalmar and, engaging as a servant in
the palace, meets secretly with the
Prince. â¢ â
Act 8 discovers Maleine in the palace
with Anne plotting her death by slow
poison.
In act 4 Maleine Is murdered. The
central scene of horror is Just previous to
the deed of murder, as Maleine, alone in
her room, shudders at some unknown
doom. Maleine is stretched upon a bed.
a large black dog quivering In a corner.
Maleine moans: "Here, Pluto! here,
Pluto! They have left me all alone on a
night like this. Hjalmar has not come to
pee me: My nurse has not come to see
me to-day, and when I call, no one
answers. Something has happened in the
castle. â¢/*.:â¢-- 1 have not heard a sound
all day; you would think It was Inhabited
by the dead. Where are you, poor old
dog? Are you going to desert me, too?
Where are you, my poor Pluto? I cannot
see you In the darkness; you are as black
as the room. Is it you I see in the
corner? Oh, It Is your eyes that gleam
In the corner! Oh. close your eyes, for
God's sake! Here, Pluto! Here, Pluto!
(Storm begins without.) Is It you I Bee
trembling in the corner? I never saw
such trembling! He Is making all the
furniture tremble. Have you seen some
thing? Answer me, my poor Pluto. Is
anybody in this room. Come her*, Pluto;
come here! Oh. come near me. upon my
bed. Indeed, you seem as though you would
quiver to death in that corner. (Rises
and goes toward the dog, who recoils and
hides under the furniture.) Where are
you, my poor Pluto? Oh, your eyes are
on flre now. But why are you afraid of
me to-night? I am going back to bed
again. (Lies down again.) If I could
sleep a little! My God! My God! How
sick I am! And yet I do not know what
It Is; no 6ne knows what It Is; the physi
cian does not know what it is; my nurse
does not know what It Is; HJalmar does
not know what it is. (The wind stirs the
bed curtains). Oh. some one is touch
ing my bed curtains. Who Is touching
my bed curtains? Is anybody In my
room? There must be somebody in my
room. Oh. here is the moonlight coming
into the room. What can that shadow be
on the tapestry? I believe the crucifix Is
swinging on the wall. Who is touching
the crucifix? My God! My God! I can
not stay here any longer. (Rises and goes
to the dooK which she tries to open.) Th*Â»y
have locked me In! Open the door, for
the love of God! There Is something In
ray room. I shall die If you leave me
here alone! Nurse! Nurse! Where are
you? -HJalmar! HJalmar! Hjalmar!
Where are you? (Returns *o bed.) I dar*
not leave my bed again. I shall turn to
ward the other side. Then I Phall not eeÂ«
what Is there on the wall. 'Some white
garments lying on a priedleu are slowly
stirred by the wind.) Oh! there Is some
one on the pr'edieu. (Turns to the other
Fide.) Oh! the shadow Is still on the wall.
(Turns back again.) Oh. something is
still on the priedleu. Oh! Ob! Oh! Oh!
Oh! I must try to shut my eyes. (Creak
ing of furniture and the > wind moaning.)
Oh ! ; Oh ! Oh ! What is the matter now ?
There are noises In my room! (Rises.)
I must see what la on the Driedteu. I
was afraid of my wedding dress! But
what is the shadow on the tapestry?
(Pulls the tapestry aside.) It Is on the
wall now! Let me drink a little water.
Oh! how the rushes In my room cry out!
And when I walk the whole room begins
to sreak. I think it U the shadow of
the cypress; there is a cypress in front of
my window. (Goes to the window.) What
a gloomy room they have given me!
(Thunder.) I can see nothing but tomb
stones by the flash of the lightning, and I
fear lest the dead enter by the windows.
Oh! what a storm In the graveyard!
What a gale In the weeping willows! I
cm going cack to bed. I can near nothing
more now, and the moonlfffht has left
the room. I can hear nothing more now.
I would rather hear some sound. (Lis
tens.) There are footsteps In the corri
dor; strange footsteps, strange footsteps!
Jney tire whispering about my chamber.
or.il I hear h:.n<l3 on the door. (The doer
begins to hcwl.) Pluto! Pluto! Seme
one Is coming in! Pluto! Pluto! Do not
howl so! ily God! My God! I think my
heart will die!"
Outside In the corridors Anne Is per
suading the unwilling King to the deed of
murder. The King begs postponement,
but Anne urges him to action. The girl
is strangled, but the King goes mad.
In act 5 the penalty of death la inflicted
en th; wicked Queen and the King is
crazed. The play closes with the ravings
of tho King:
King. ThÂ«y will feel cold en the flagstones 1
She cried out "Mamma!" and then "Oh! Ottt
Oh!" 'TU a pity, is it not? A poor little
maid: But 'twas the wind! Oh: never throw
the window* ooen! It must have been the
wind. There were blind vultures In the wind
to-night! Do not let her little hands hanÂ«
loose upon the floor. Tou are nearly treading
on her hands. Oh! Oh! . Take care.
Nurse. Come away, come away. Let every
one go to bed. It Is time. Come, come.
King. Yes. help me. I find it a little hard
to walk. â¢ â¢ â¢ I am a poor little old man.
My leas no longer work; but my head is all
right.
Nurse. Come away, my poor lord.
King. My God! My God! She Is waiting
now on the wharves of hell.
Nurse. Come away! Come away!
King. Is there any one hers that fears the
curte of the dead?
Argur Ay, my lord, I do.
King. Well! close their eyes, then, and let
us be gone.
>-*urae. Yes. yea. Come hence! Come henoet
Kins. I come; I come. Oh! Oh! How lone
Â«hall I bÂ« now! I stand in woe up to my ears.
At 77 years! Where are you now?
Nurse. Here! Here!
King. You will not be angry with me? Let
us go to breakfast. Will there be salad for
breakfast? I should like a little salad.
Nurse. Yes. yes. There will be some.
King. I do not know why. I am a Uttla sad
to-day. My God! My God! How unhappy the
dead look.
In point of characterization the King Is
depicted as old and weak, but not bad at
fceart. Wnen Anna require* the death of
Maleine the King pleads: "Let us not
do It." Anne is dark, domineering and
unscrupulous. Prince HJalmar bas a
"girl's face." dresses in melancholy black
and is reflective and irresolute. HÂ« haunts
the graveyard and Is given to soliloquy,
as In the following sentence: "It rains;
there is a burial in the graveyard. They
have dug two graves, and the dies lraa
ccmes Into the house. There Is not a win
dow but looks out on the graveyard; It
eats Into the very gardens of the castle,
end the last graves come down as far aa
the pond. They are opening the coffin; I
shall close the window." Maleine la beau
tiful and spiritual. Her lover remembers
the "way she had of casting down her
eyes and of holding her hands and her
strange white eyelashes! And her look!
It was as though one were suddenly In a
great pool of fresh water."
Uglyayne Is the creature of her mother
âpretty, green-eyed and vicious. The
Prince said of her: "There la a llttla
kitchen maid's soul at the bottom of her
green eyes." Angus and tha nurse are
faithful companions of HJalmar and
Maleine.
*It will be seen that the general atmos
phere and scopÂ© of the play are sugges
tive of "Macbeth." The weather is the
same In both plays. Crows croak In the
environs of Ysselmonde and flames hover
above the marshes. Anne Is the daring
Lady Macbeth, urging the King to deeds
of crime. The King is the Than* of Caw
dor grown older and more Impotent. Tha
seven nuns Intoning their Miserere recall
tho seven witches in "Macbeth." When
tho King, standing at the open window
after the murder of Maleine. while the
rain Is pouring In, exclaims. ""It Is rain
ing! It Is raining on me! It is pouring on
my head! I wish I were on the lawn! I
wish I were out of doors! It is pourin*
on my head!' It would take all the water
of the flood to baptize me now!" we are
reminded of the effort of Lady Macbeth
to wash away the evidences of crime. But
throughout the play there Is a curious
blending of reminiscence. The King in his
old age and remorse and madness Is sug
gestive of Lear; and when he says at
Anne's death. "Have you any black feath
ers? We should have black feathers to
know If the Queen still lives," and when
Angus remarks at the close of the play,
"Another night like this and all our heads
will be Â»hlte," the reader is reminded of
the worvs of Lear and Kent In the earlier
play. Anne, on her part, while reminis
cent of Lady Macbeth, calls even more
quickly to mind the Queen of "Cymbe
line." She has the same daring and maj.
cullne mind and domineers over HJalmar
as the Queen over Cymbellne. And for
Cloten and the opposition to the marriage
of Posthumus ana Imogen we have here
Anne's daughter Uglyayne and the denial
of the betrothal between Prince HJalmar
and Princess Maleine. Anne's love of
poisoning la more characteristic of Cym
beline'a Queen than of Lady Macbeth. In
both plays, furthermore, the women are
thwarted by a physician, who substitutes
harmless medicines for the Intended pois
ons. The confessions of the physicians
are almost identical. In lesser parts there
runs a parallelism with other plays of
Shakespeare. The resourceful and active
nurse la the nurse of "Romeo and Juliet."
Maleine herself Is not unlike Juliet in her
girlishness, she being 15 to Juliet's 14.
HJalmar, the Prince, is an attenuated
Hamlet, the very names being here sug
gestive. Like Hamlet, he is Irresolute,
much given to gloom and wears the pale
cast of thought. He has an Horatio in
the guise of Angus. There is further a
grave-digging - scene; a madman . digs
graves every night In the orchard. The
incidents of "Hamlet" are also drawn
upon for the tremendous exits of the fifth
act. As Hamlet convicts his father of
crime by means of a prearranged scene.
so does Prince Hjalmar accuse the King
by causing strange noises and speaking of
fearsome things, displaying tapestries of
â¢The Slaughter of the Innocents" and
"The Last Judgment," until the Kin;?
cries out, "This has been done purposely!"
The nuns are heard singing the litanies
of the Blessed Virgin, and suddenly a
light from a stalned-glasa window Illum
ines the room and floods the King and
Anne. Then HJalmar cries out again:
"Who arranged all this? There Is some
one who knows all." The murdered Ma
leine recalls also the luckless Ophelia of
the former play.
In the matter cf construction Maeter
linck, departing from his usual custom In
this respect, follows in this play the
Shakespearean formulas. Five acts form
the norm of dramatic construction. An
Intrigue develops through the first act. a
counteraction being established In the sec
ond act. when Maleine dissuades ITgly
ayne from meeting the Prince and taking
up the cue herself. It is a play full of
weird scenes and dreadful terrors. Neme
sis performs the same part as on the
Shakespearean stage. Ethical harmony Is
restored to the kingdom by the principle
of retribution. In this one play Maeter
linck has been schooled by other centu
ries, adding, however, dramatic effects* pe
culiar to himself and to the modern stage.
The effect of the play as a whole is cumu
lative and represents the experience of
three centuries In highly subtleized form.

POINTS OF EXCELLENCE
A Few Reasons Which AxÂ© E&pidly
Maying a New Catarrh Care
Famous.
Btuart'e Catarrh Tablets., the new Ca-
tarrh cure, has the following advantages
over other catarrh remedies:
First: These tablets contain no cocaine,
morphine or any other injurious drug and
tre a? safe and beneficial for children as
for adults; this !s an important point when
it is recalled that many catarrh remedies
<5o contain these very objectionable Ingre-
dients.
Next: Being In tablet form this remedy
does not deteriorate with age. or an ex-
jinFure to thÂ«Â» air as liquid preparations in-
variably do.
Next: The tablet form not only pre-
fÂ« rves the medirinaJ properties but it Is
ro far mere convenient to carry and to
u.Â«*Â» at any tinr* that it Is only a question I
of tim* wh*>n \he tablet will entirely su-
persede liquid medicines, as it has already
done in th* medical department of the
United States army.
Next: No secret is made of the cdmpo-
ritlon of Stuart's Catarrh Tablet!"; they
contain the active principle of Eucalyptus
bark, red gnm. blood root and Hydrastin.
ell harmless Jj.itiseptics which, however.
z.r* dc-ath to catarrhal germs wherever
found, tiecause they eliminate them from
the blood.
Next: You can not cure catarrh by lo-
cal applications to the nose and throat,
because these are simply local symptoms
end such treatment can not possibly reach
the real seat of catarrhal disease, which
Is the blood; fcr this reason, inhalers,
<3<iuchep. eprays and powders never really
cure catarrh, but eimply give temporary
relief which a dnse of plain salt and water
will do Just as well. Â¦
Catarrh must be driven out of the sys-
tem, out of the blood, by an Internal rem-
edy because an Internal remedy Is the only
kind which can be assimilated Into the
blood.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets do this better
than the old form of treatment because
they contain every safe specific known to
modern science In the antiseptic treatment
of the disease.
Next: The use of Inhalers and epraying
epparatufes, besides being- ineffective and
is expensive, while a com-
f!ete treatment of Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
els can be had at any drug etore in the
Cnlted States and Canada for 50 cents.

NEW YORK. Dec. IS.â On the opening call
prices worked up 8@9 points on- fairly active
covering and foreign support, which originated
in much better cables from Liverpool and Man
chester than was expected. Toward midday
a setback occurred and prices fell to yester
day's closing under active profit taking, . the
Incentive of which was a report that spot cot

The market cloeed Quiet, with prices J points

NEW TORK. Dec. 1J.â There was no ap
rrec'.able letup In the furious activity In the
Stock market to-day or In the exceedingly
broad ar.d varied trading. A quick market
vae offered fcr almoet any volume of stocks
and very notable strength continued at various
points ia the list, but the burden of the proflt
takisg eales proved rather heavier than for
t rr.e time past and made more general Inroad
upon prices. The market fairly turned re
actionary throughout at one time under the
Influence of Ecrr_e rather violent breaks In spe
c'al stocks. Tin Plate was the most effec
tive of these when lt suddenly dumped 2%
tfter a show of early strength. A drop oZ
14 points in New York Air Brake waa lmpres
e;ve in Its way. but had little effect on the
market. The reactionary tendency of the
;::.:Â¦ r Vanderbllts developed that speculators
had been taking rather too sanguine a view of
poepible readjustments of securities of these
companies. Cleveland. Cincinnati. Chicago and
M. Louis and the New York. Chicago and St.
Louis stocks fell back heavily, although some
wer.t up briskly in the morning. An effort was
made to reclaim the bull position In the final
hour by eudaen advances la Northern Paciflo.
tjugar, Illinois Central, General Electric, Chi
cago Terminal Transfer and the Wisconsin
Central stocks. The advances In those above
tbe low point ran from 2 to 6% points. Prices
did stiffen In sympathy, but the speculative
enthusiasm was not fully renewed and the
market closed very feverish and unsettled
Â¦with a point or more lost of some of these sud
den gains. Even the Erie stocks, which have
been the real backbone for some days, cant
to a pause to-day, and the first preferred, after
rlÂ«lr-Â« 2%, reacted 1%,, with a final fractional
rally. There have been such reactions from
tep rrlefs many times before In the present
movement of stocks, and the real lack In to
day*Â» market Menu to be that the new stocks
Â¦w-Mca are available to be rushed np were
euEtalning forces In the market. Pretty much
the whole list has been exploited In the course
of the present speculation. The character of
the market, otherwise than In theae particulars
v-tLS not materially changed. Professional
operator* are constantly on the lookout to take
the bear side of the market with the culmina
tion of the rise and they sold freely on the
t hort side to-day as they have done for several
<l*.yÂ» paÂ«t, but tbe-y also covered IaxÂ«ely before
the close. The demands of tbe speculation upon
the money market have made no lmpresElon
jet upon money rates, a development which
Â¦would prove an effectual check upon exhaustive
ep*cula.tlon.
The bond market was active and strong
Total sales, par value, $5,260,000.
United Btates refunding 2s advanced % and
new 4s declined % per cent on tbe last call.
An Incident of the very active business In
tb* Mock maxket la the high prices asked for
membership on the Stock Exchange. To-day
812,000 was bid for a seat on the Ex-Chan*"
comjajred with a sale yesterday at $50,000
which was the record price.

dull and Paris was lower.
Chicago was slugcrish and the market waa
small. The traders sold. Long Wheat con

to be of a holiday character during the- re
mainder of the week. Toward the close of
the session the market became firmer on more
bullish cablee from the Argentine, Snow
cabling that rains were interfering with the
harvest. This information started the shorts
to covering and the market turned firmer.

CHICAGO. Dec 19.â Figures which later
proved to be incorrect, but which before the
mistake was corrected made Minneapolis re
ceipts dlscouraglngly heavy, together with the
prospective increase of Northwest stocks, gave
the wheat market a push downward at the
start. May opened unchanged to He lower at
72H@72V4c and soon sold off to 72Â»4c. Early
Argentine news, too, was rather bearish, and
when bullish news from the same quarter was
received and Minneapolis figures were oor
rected, making receipts at that point 282 cars
Instead of 471. shorts began bidding. A private
Argentine cable declared that rain, was inter
fering with harvesting and a Hamburg wire
said the Intimated Argentine surplus of- 40.000,
000 bushels was seven pounds short weight per
bushel. A Â¦ better cash demand was reported
and as this was in line with the fact that this
market has reached an export basis with
Liverpool, the advance begun by the covering
of shorts was continued with the result that
; the market closed firm at the best price of
the day. May closed over yesterday at
72%@73o.
â¢ Interest in corn was centered in the Janu
ary delivery, but at that the market was a
! dull and narrow one, with little business done.
January was strong and December steady be
cause the receipts, 437 cars, contained no con
tract corn. May was steady In sympathy.
May closed unchanged at 36V4C January Vi@Vic
up at 37c, and December Uc up at 4V/ t c.
Oats were, as usual, extremely dull. May
closed a shade lower at 23HS23%c.
Provisions were strong and fairly active
Hog receipts \rece smaller than had been ex
pected and there was a good cash demand.
January pork closed 17H@20c higher, lard 6c

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
CLOSING.
Ing waa still mainly professional. At the cIom
they eased, except in the case of the chief
favorites. Conservative experts deprecate ex
cessive pushing of low-priced shares, fearing
the ultimate effect on the market. Money was
steady. The bank did a considerable discount
business. Paris and Berlin exchanges were
Ellghtly more favorable.

Boston Wool Market.
BOSTON. Dec 19.â The 'American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow: . '../<Â¦
The colder weather of the post week or ten
days has started, a somewhat better business
1 Vi u h ? clothln g trade, which is reflected . in a
slightly increased- inquiry for wool, but the
amount of business actually transacted In the
latter commodity shows no improvement: in
fact. It is slightly less than that of last week.
The general feeling is that the volume of
business in the wool market will be of moder
ate proportions from now until after the turn
or the new year.. Manufacturers are buying
wool only to meet pressing wants. The wool
trade therefore naturaly anticipates a*decidedly
improved demand for wool after the turn of the
year. The market may be quoted * as quite
steady. Actual selling prices remain un
ofcanged.

the tess became so heavy that for a time

There was no danger of our foundering,

toward Mondav evening. On Tuesday it
started again, "coming in squalls blowing
at the rate of about sixty miles an hour.
It was one of the worst gales I have en
countered on the sea in many years. We
made slow headway, and. as there was no

The lury retired and brought In a ver
dict "That Benjamin's death was caused
by a fall precipitate by a blow struck by
Edward R. Shirran." After the verdict
Shirran was charged at the City Prison
with manPlaurhter and was immediately
released on J3000 bail.
Ed Shlrran. whom Benjamin charged
with the assault, was the principal wit
ness. He explained to the Jury that on
the evening In question he was walking
on Market street with his wife, when
Benjamin, who was with another gentle
man named Tungate, bumped Into her.
This was repeated, and later, -when Shlr
ran stepped back of his wife to allow
eome ladieB to pass, Benjamin and Tun
gate took his place and kept bumping
against her and staring at her. He asked
Benjamin what he meant and was given
ari Insulting reply. While trying to have
Benjamin desist, Shirran was poked sev
eral times with a cane in the etomach
by Tungate and forced Into a corner.
Shlrran called to his brother to help
him and Benjamin, applying a vile epi
thet, eaid: "Now I'll fix you. He raised
his arm to strike when Shlrran assaulted
him, knocking him down, and treating
Tungate In a. like manner.
Tungate testified that he had been vis
ited by a brother-in-law of Shirran named
Josselyn. who said that the affair was
the result of a mistake. Josselyn. he said,
explained that two men had Insulted Mr.
and Mrs. Shlrran and that he and Shlr
ran had gone back to find the men. Mrs.
Shlrran made a mistake in pointing them
out and the row resulted.

providing a means of escape in case of
discovery. He then passed-back through
the dining-room, entered the hall- and
went upstairs. In the room occupied by
Fred, the twelve-year-old son of Mr.
Thomas, he secured $12 25, a fountain pen
and some other -small articles. The
burglar then made his way to the sleeping
apartments occupied by Mrs. Thomas and
her daughter, Nora; a girl of 18 years.
"I was awakened by the flashing of
light on my dresser." said Mrs. Thomas
to-day. "In the darkness and on first
awakening I thought It was my son and
called softly to him, 'Hudson'.' There was
no answer. Then I realized who was in
the room. The burglar kept moving a
bullseye lantern over the dresser in
search of valuables. He must have heard
my call, but did not heed it. I was thor
oughly frightened and noiselessly pinched
my daughter on the arm- As soon as
-she awoke she saw . the burglar and
screamed. In an instant he sprang to the
side of the bed and flashed the bullseye
lantern in our faces, to blind us. He
thrust a revolver into our faces and cried,
'Your money.' My daughter was cool
and said, 'Why, we haven't any money
here. You don't suppose we keep it Vn
our house.' 'Your watches/- demanded
the man. Again Nora said, 'We haven't
any.' She was so cool that I got courage
and called two or three times to my. son.
The burglar told us both to shut up and
threatened us with -his revolver.
"My son Hudson had heard the noise
and came running toward our room. He
called out. 'I'm coming,' and this fright

LONDON, Dec. 20.â The War. Office last
evening could f give no Information re
garding the reports of a Boer invasion
of Cape Colony. The officials expressed
the opinion, however, that the newspaper
accounts were exaggerated and that prob
ably the troops who have been employed
in chasing General Dewet will be diverted
to deal with the Invader3. Having regard
to -the customary methods of the War, Of-'
flee, this can only be interpreted as con-'
firming the reports that Lord Kitchener
in the meantime^ keeps a tight rein over
the news, which increases the public dis
quiet. There is a persistent rumor that
he has demanded heavy reinforcements.
According to the Dally Mail, private tel
egrams received, in London yesterday de
pict the situation in Cape Colony as some
what ominous. It seems that the invad
ing Boers are receiving considerable as-
Eistance from the local Dutch and that
the troops at the disposal of the: British
authorities are not sufficient to cope with
any serious spread of the military opera
tions. It 1Â» believed that the Government
has at last awakened to the seriousness
of the situation and is making the utmost
efforts to provide Lord Kitchener with
horses and- mules.

BOER INVASION
OF CAPE COLONY
BERKELEY. Dec 19.â A burglar
entered the house of F. F.
Thomas. 2401 Channing way.
shortly before 2 o'clock this
morning and made his way to a
room where Mrs. Thomas and her daugh- j
ter were sleeping. Mother and daughter
were awakened and when the latter
6creamed the burglar flashed a bullseye
lantern on them, thrust a revolver in
their faces and threatened their lives.
The prrnnpt assistance of Hudson, the
22-year-old son of Mr. and Mrs.
Thomas, caused the burglar to take flight
and he succeeded in making his escape.
He took with him $13 75 in coin and sev
eral articles of small value.
The house-breaker effected an entrance
through a small window opening on the
front porch.' Evidently it had not been
securely locked and was " easily ' forced
with a jimmy. Before discovering the
window, however, the burglar had made
futile attempts to bore holes through two
heavy doors on the porch. The main
door, of heavy oak. had a half-inch auger
hole bored through part way into a panel
near the lock. The other door, of red
wood, had five- holes in it. They were
bored close together in a small panel near
the lock. One hole was entirely through
and the others nearly so.
After getting Into the house the burglar
made hi3 way through the dining-room to
the kitchen, where he opened doors and

GREAT TRIUMPH
FOR CALIFORNIA
Comnryissioner W. W. Foote
Tells About Paris Exposition.
far as I was personally concerned there
wasn't an American came near our head
quarters who went away dissatisfied. I
had carriages ready ill the time, did any
amount of private tntsrtaining. but I felt
that I was there as "the servant of Cali
fornia. It didn't- ma.tter whether It was
the fellow from Fresno who had saved
for a year to go to the exposition or the
man. who could buy Parisâ they all were
bllke to me.
"I went down to see General Peck one
day. He said: 'What are you people doing
from California?'
" 'Well.' I replied. *we are doing the
best we know how." .
" 'What about these headquarters of
yours?" . â
" 'We are paying for them and the
United States has sot (1.000.000 and can
get one of it wants to.'
"That's the way It went." Everybody
was amazed at California.
"Now for some particulars. If it had
not been for California there would not
have been an idea of our forestry re
sources. California was the only Stats
that made a forestry exhibit. The only
other forestry exhibit was that of tho
Southern Railway, showing Florida and
Mississippi woods. We had forty-nlnfl
magnificent specimens, and the famous
Hatch collection. We presented a mag
nificent redwood table to the President cf
France, but he could not accept It be*
cause cf some law about accepting elf ts
Irom foreign powers.
"Then we turned It over to the Ameri
can Chamber of Commerce in Paris, an
Institution which will maintain a perma
nent exhibit there of American product*.
That is one outgrowth of the exposition
and a mighty valuable one. In disposing*
of our exhibits at the close of the expo
sition we took care to place them wher*Â»
they would do good. For example, somo
of our California made> furniture arvl
bric-a-brac went to the American Hospi
tal. Our mining- exhibits went to one *>f
the prominent scientific societies. We
sent a line collection of California wood.i
to the famous park at Vlncennes. Other
things went on exhibition at the Ameri
can Express Company. A large lot of our
wines and our canned stuff was sold with
a guarantee that they would be used In
the public restaurants.
"We sent maps, six in a series, showing
our agricultural, horticultural, mining,
oil. forest and other resources, to every
board and Chamber of Commerce In Eu
rope. We sent them to every foreign com
mission at the exposition and we couldn't
supply the demand.
"I "went over for California and I never
missed a trick. I understand there's bÂ«en
a lot of abuse here, but I won't discuss
It. That's all there Is to It."
Commissioner Foote wanned up In som*
descriptions of the magnificent courts oi
France as architectural and esthetic mar
vels, >but he did not like the stylo of
conducting trials.
"Why." ejaculated the Commissioner,
"I saw a. murder trial that took less than
an hour to finish. The Jury satâ well. It
seems to me, a quarter of a mil* from
the lawyers and his client. Three Jnd-res
In redâ blood-retJ robes, ready for buai
ness-^-told the jury what to do. They re
tired and In five minutes had the poor
man ready for the guillotine.
"I left Secretary Gaskill in New York
with Assistant Secretary W. E. Da trie
Jr. They were- cleaning up some work
there on returning exhibits."

Exposition from the ". magnificent adver
tising our St^Uo received from Its com
mission and I the tremendous social, com
mercial and all-round activity displayed
by her representatives." Such was W.
W. Focte's expression to-night upon his
arrival home from Paris, where through
out the great exposition he acted as one
of the California commission sent out
from this State to advertise her wealth
cf resources to the people of the worlo.
1 hat the work was well done. Commis
sioner Foote declares with much em
phasis. ...Brushing aside irom the mo
ment the minor details, he sums up his
opinion of results In the brief comment
above quoted. â¢
Foote, with his daughter.
Miss Bertha Foote, arrived at Oakland
to-night On the overland train. They went
at once to the residence of Mrs. Chauncey
Taylor at 704 Eighth street, where a few
intimate friends were assembled to wel
come home the distinguished Calif orhlan.
Foote was in the best of
health and Â¦ good spirits, thoroughly
aroused to the subject of the exposition
and more than satisfied with what he em
phatically declared had been one of the
greatest triumphs that California had ever
won/ ,' ' -.*-;Â¦
"The commission does not require any
commendation outside of the report "which
will shortly be given to the public through
the regular otlicial channels," said Mr.
Foote. "Now, of course. I have heard of
stories and lies and trash that have been
sent out from Paris with relation to the
commission, but I want to say right here
that I have good reason to know whence
they emanated, who was responsible for
them, and I will not dignify them by giv
ing them the slightest consideration.
When the people of this State realize that
California took a grand prlx In every
class in which the State had an exhibit
when the people learn that California took
half the" medals, awards and prizes that
were given to the whole United States,
and then when the - people of California
learn by our official reports that we re
: turn $14,000 of our appropriation to the
State, they will realize that the record of
her representatives is a good one.
"No, I do not know any more French
now than when I went away. I did not
stop to study French. I was- too busy
trying to do something for California.
''When I eot over there* I found that
Â¦out of the sixty Jurors that had been ap
pointed from the United States on award*
California had not one. I decided that
would no.t do. So I spent five weeks get
ting a representation and I landed five
men. You see my old training in that line
served me in good hand then and the way
our jurors .plucked the grand prlx and
the little prizes and all the rest was a
caution to our fellow-citizeno from other
States.
"Of course we had some banquets.
They were good ones and I am glad Cali
fornia had a chance to show- what she
could do. The first one was to De Young
and that was arranged before I got over
there. The next .big burst of festivities
was the Californlans' celebration of
Fourth of July. That was Just befora
Runyon left. I was doubtful whether. we
could use any of our appropriation for
that affair, so I decided to raise the
money myself. In twenty minutes I got
$1000, and had Californlans tumbling over
themselves to contribute. Well, we con
tracted for Sousa's Band to play In front
of the grand opera-house. . For the first
time in the history of Paris a permit was
Issued by the Prefect of Police for that
concert, and when the time. came he sent
200 policemen around". We opened the
California headquarters and had 4000
guests during the day. including not less
than 1200 Californlans. In the evening
25,000 Frenchmen were in the square to
hear the concert, and the "Star Spangled
Banner" and the "Marseillaise 1 drove
them frantic with enthusiasm. Then we
had Emma Nevada Albertinl and a lot of
other prominent singers and Instrumen
talists who begged to entertain us.
1 "The next big affair was our celebra
tion of the semi-centennial Admission
day. We sent 1500 Invitations and had
everybody there from the American Min
ister down. And we whooped it up for

Hudson and Nora followed him. but he
leaped out the window .he had entered
and made his escape.
"I believe he was a young man. for I
thought at first he was my son. He wore
a black mask of cloth with simply two
holes cut for eyes. He had on a dark
cult with sack coat and a black slouch
hat. He evidently had something soft on
his feet, as he made no nolsa when he
ran." * Â¦Â¦,-Â¦;'. < i\
"I was more frightened when It was
over with," said Nora Thomas, "than
â¢while it was happening. I really didn't
know there was any money in the house,
so I didn't think I was telling him any
thing wrong. He carried away my purse,
but that only had $1 50 in it. We never
had an experience like that before and
we don't want one again."
The burglar in his flight left an um
brella on the front porch. It is an ordi
nary black affair with a steel rod. The
handle 13 of dark rough wood with a half
crook. There is an unengraved silver
name plate on the. handle.
The Thomas house is one of the largest
and finest in town. It Is a large three
story dwelling on the corner of Chan
ning way and Dana street. The Thomas
family has only occupied it for a few
months. Mr. Thomas was not at home
at the time of the burglary. He was In
Calaveras County, where his duties as
superintendent and manager of the Gwtn
mine keep him most' of the time.-,
A considerable quantity of Jewelry
and silverware were overlooked by the
burglar, *
I Berkeley evidently has a house-breaker
to deal with. Two visits have been made
to the B. W.' Morgan house at the corner
of Durant avenue and College way. ' On
Monday night Mrs. Morgan heard some
one ang on investigating saw a man leap
over the railing of the front porch and
run down the street. Last night at
about midnight Miss Morgan aroused the
family, declaring 1 there was a burglar in
the house. Lights were turned on and
an investigation commenced. The man
had evidently made his way into the
house through a basement window and
had entered the main part of the house by
the basement stairs. *>. On hearing the
family he made his escape the same way
he entered. ;

CHICAGO. Dec. 19.â Mayor Harrison
will stop all prize fighting in -the city ot
Chicago. He issued an order to the act
ing Chief of Police this afternoon in
structing him to enforce the ruling passed
at the last, meeting of the city fathers.
"If the game is too bad for the Council
it certainly is too bad for me," was his
Honor's comment en the resolution.
This puts an end to all the stories that
Mayor Harrison xvould not sign the lecent
ordinance of the Council.
Reports were out that he would allow j
shows for which permits had been Is
sued. It was hinted that the Mayor
might then be amenable to the law for j
granting permits on his own authority for
tight shows which were directly In con
trast to the State laws. The foregoing
order, however, does away with all ques
tions. It Is even thought that boxing at
the Chicago Athletic Association will be
stopped and the slate wiped clean.

noon. The storm. Captain Hansen, of the
Rainier says, is one of the worst that he
has ever etperieneed on the Pacific Ocean.
The cale. blowing in sudden squalls, some
times attained a. velocity of more than
-sixty miles an hour. The Frisbie'6 sailsâ
s-uch as it was attempted to carry to keep
her head up to the storm â were torn to

could be spread. After the struggle had

even If the weather moderated, his sup

The Supervisors' Judiciary Committee
recommended yesterday that the resolu
tion to rescind the permit for the Central
Theater be indefinitely postponed. Thin
action was taken as the result of the re
port of the i Fire Deoartment that the
structure is safe and even safer than
some other theaters. It was the sense of
the committee that, beine an existing
theater, it is not amenable to the theater
ordinance- passed subsequently to its orig.
inal construction, though it complies rea
sonably with the ordinance. The Tax Col
lector will be directed to issue the neces
sary license.
Superintendent Simmons stated that all
the suggestions made by Fire Chief Sul
livan had been carried out. Thesa in
cluded the widening- of the main entrance
to 22 feet 2 inches and the removal of alt
obstructions so as to leave the entire
structure clear. The three windbreaks
under the auditorium are all in position.
The continuation of the brick pros>cenlum
wall from the stage line to the ground U
completed and above ihe stage line It will
b* bulltto a height of four feet above the
roof. Fireproof shutters are being pro
vided for eight .windows on the exterior
of .the auditorium. The total exit space
from the auditorium is eeventj--four and
a half feet and from the staee twenty
two and a half feet.
AseUtant Chief Dougherty, who repre
sented Chief Sullivan, said he went from
one end of the building- to the other ex
amined the emergency exits and found it
well provided in that respect.
"As far as I have seen," said Dougher
ty, "the building is first class as to exits.-
There Is more danger really from "panic
than, fire In a theator and on that ac
count a theater with ffood exits is com
paratively safe."
"I am satisfied that the exits of thi3
theater are better ihan those in some
other theaters in this city." said Commis
sioner Manson. "It also possesnen th*
characteristic of being a 'slow-burninc"
structure, which Is In its favor in eass
of- fire. The standard- of safety provided
by the theater ordinance is very high and
according to that standard the building is
not altogether safe In case of a panic."

Says He Will Accept Clerks
Certificated by the
Commission.
Tax Collector Scott etated yesterday
that he will bow to the Â«inevitable and ac
cept the clerks certified by the Civil Serv
ice Commission for his office* He has re
quested, however, that he tie not com
pelled to make a requisition for the clerks
ur.tll the first of the year and his request
hits been granted. As published in yes
terday's Call, this Â¦will result In probably
eighteen of Scott's present force losing
their positions, as only five are high
enough up on the list to be certified for
appointment.
Scott expresses considerable dissatisfac
tion ix-ra-use the same Questions were
asked of his clerks in the tax office and
tne license office, over which he has con
trol. He says the duties in the two offices
are entirejy dissimilar, and contends that
two distinct examinations should have
been held. The clerks in the license office
were uuable to answer the questions
wh'ch related entirely to the tax otlico
â¢ nd consequently are low on the list or
did not pass at all. In fact, he was as
sured that another examination would be
held for the license office, but none has
bo far been called- Scott declares that he
will accept the dictum of the Civil Service
Commission in regard to his clerks, but
when the list of eligible deputies is an
nounced he will oppose any attempt to
disturb the deputies now in his office,
feeveral of whom did not take the examin
fction.
An apparent Inconsistency in the mark-
Ing of examination papers by the commis
sion was cited by Auditor Wells â¢ yester
day. "When "Wells was allowed to select
three extra clerks of his own choslng out
of ten required to extend the tax rolls he
appointed Francis X. Foley to one of the
places. He learned afterward that Foley
â¢was a civil service eligible for ordinary
clerk. hlÂ« Ftandinrr being No. 83. with a
percentage of 82. Foley also took the ex
amination for experienced clerk In the tax
office, and his standing on that list is No.
J, with 87.45 pÂ«r cent. Foley is a son of
Frarcis Foley, commissary of the State
prison at SÂ«n Quentin. and brother of W.
I. Foley, Governor Game's secretary.

MR. AXD MRS. WILTJAM J. HENNESSEY. "WHO WERE MaRRIED, IN
THIS CITY YESTERDAY BY THE REV. JOSEPH McQUAIDE IN THE
CHURCH OF THE HOLY REDEEMER.
A husband sitting on the witness stand
in a Superior Court and being cross-ex-
Emir.eil by his wife was the novel sight
witnessed in San Francisco yesterday.
Charles H. Smith, wlio is trying to obtain
,a Uivoice from Mrs. Josephine Smith bc
for; Judge ' Dairgerfleld, was the witness
and the ];tdy named pumped the ques
tions into him with a rapidity and width
of rar;pe such as a woman, who has re
ceived a glorious chance to "hurl all the
vocal arrows of her scorn at the man she
despises is likely to employ.
Of course, Mrs. Smith had to be "called
down" by the court Â¦whenever her 'line of
questioning became Interminable, which
happened frequently, his Honor, courte
ously informing her once that she would
better, "pass to another line unless she
struck a lead." The Portia of the divorce
court was not content with her husband's
rea^sertion of the fact that she had hurled
a dozen wine eiapses at him, but with a
lock of positive triumph she asked,wheth
er she had hurled them in a bunch or one
at a time. Smith actually gasped at this.
He had to acknowledge that the glasses
i came his way one at a time and not In
bunches. This was one of the most ma
teriai tacts brought out by Mrs. Smith's
questioning.
The rules that govern tne right of coun
sel in cross-examination seem to be
past the understanding of Mrs. Smith,
though she feels competent to conduct her
defense In propria persona. If It were not
for these rules Mrs. Smith, as a cross
examiner, would be a success. " As
it is. the condition is otherwise. Though
she furnished considerable discomfort for
Mr. Smith, the court and officers, she fur
nished amusement for the court frequent
ers, to which extent her efforts as a law
yer were a success. .
It would take a page to cite the Irrele
vant questions asked by Mrs. Smith, but
a portion of the dialogue between husband
and wife was exceedingly interesting. In
question and answer formâ the Wife the
Interrogator, the husband the humble 'wit
ness â a portion of the dialogue follows:
"Do you believe that you are now in the
presence of the Judge, of All, a9 .well as
In the presence of this earthly court?" de
manded Mrs. Smith hysterically, as she
faced her husband. â¢"'-. â¢
Mr. Smith's calm answer "I do" reduced
Mrs. Smith's religious ecstacy to a mate
rial degree, and the examination contin
ued.
"Where did you first meet the young
girl who became your wife?"
"I met you"
"Don't say 'you* when addressing. me!"
interrupted Mra. Smith. "For the pur
pose of this examination I am Mrs. Smith
or the defendant."
"I met the defendant first at a boardingr
house at 227 Geary street,", continued
Smith, accepting his wife's suggestion not
to say "you." "and I fell deeply enough in
love with her to marry her.''.
"How many times did you have to pro
pose to her."
"Once was enough," came the answer.
"Cbme now; didn't you have to ask her
hand three times. Once might be enough
to-day, but you must remember that other
young men \fere paying, attention to her
those days and you were jealous," de
clared Mrs. Smith.
"Your time to testify will come later,"
interrupted Judge Daingerfleltl.
Mrs. Smith continued on a line of ex
amination to endeavor to make' the wit
ness admit "how happy their little home
had been" for some time, but receiving
little encouragement went on to another
line. The examination continued as fol
lows:
"Didn't you kill your father's horse with
a pitchfork," which was in keeping with
your cruel nature?"
"No " answere'd Smith serenely.
"Didn't you associate improperly with
a woman at 216, now 226, Powell street?"
"I think you have hold of the wrong
man," said Smith.
"I have hold of my husband very tight."
"Never mind; don't argue," ordered the
court.
"Didn't you try to get into that house
at 216 Powell street one night and run
into my armsâ Into the arms of this de
fendant?"
"Not I." '
"Didn't this defendant so frighten you
that you Jumped down the steps?"
"I lumped down no steps." .
"Did you ever pass as a cousin of Miss
Smith, a young lady occupant of the
house?"
"Not Iâ never." . ,
"Are you the father of any child other
than your son born in lawful wedlock?"
"One child is enough."
I'Madam," interrupted the 'court, "you
will have to pass to another, line unless
you strike a lead." .
"Didn't you. go to the racetrack on
Washington's birthday of 1836 with a
blonde and a brunette?" â¢:
"Never did."
"Didn't you leave a saloon on Mont
gomery street and go ..to the railroad
building on the same day?"
"Never was in the saloon to leave it."
"When you left the Golden Gate lodging
house on > Geary street did you tell the
landlord gocd-by?"
Smith smiled Jin answer.
"Did you pay. your newspaper bill?" .'
"I owe nothing. that I know of.".
"You charge me with throwing a dozen
wine glasses , and â¢ breaking them. 'Did I
throw, them In a bunch or one at a time?",
"One at a time." gasped Smith.
"Did I hit you?"
"No; you missed your mark."
"Where Is your proof that you , were
forced to pay the bill for more glasses?"
Â¦ "I haven't the bill with me."
"Then you can't prove this charge, so I
will mark it off.". -
This burst of innocence regarding plead
ing and practice on the part of Mrs. Smith
was followed by a ripple of laughter from
the court frequenters and. the bailiff
rapped for order. Â¦ .
On this Mne of examination Mrs. Smith
proceeded all " day, and, as yhe informed
the court, will continue, for^ two days
more. .,
