that could not be controlled by hundreds
of streams thrown upon them.
On the first floor were the offices of the
company and .the retail dispensing de
partment. There were about half a
dozen persons on this floor at the time of
the fire.. On the second floor was Brelten
bj+ch's Pepsin Chewing Gum ' Factory,
where ten girls and six boys were em
ployed The third and fourth floors were
storage floors for .the Tarrant Company.
There were several porters on the. two
floors. The fifth was used as a bottling

ties. Six girls were employed here. The
sixth floor was the place of manufacture,
where three men were usually . employed.

In Â«the basement were tha engineers'

The number of persons in the Tarrant
building was estimated to be In the
neighborhood of fifty. Secretary Allen of
the company said that there were forty
five employes and he thought all got out

that the Tarrant building in Its fall hal
crushed down upon two crowded restau

that if any persons were caught. in thess
places it was the kitchen help and very
few outsiders, if anybody. The patrons

after 'the flames subsided a clear view

their count to go into the polling places I

This drcterafTSn: containing' an incite

by Richard Croker to several reporters at

the special request that his advice be

"any person who unlawfully goes within !
the guard rail of any polling place, or un- !
lawfully remains wiihin su^b guard rails Â¦

guilty of a misdemeanor."
Should Mr. Croker's advice be followed
persons who entered polling places would
be liable to punishment t/or misdemeanor.
By Republican leaders Mr. Croker's rec
ommendation was hailed to-nigrht as the
most startling advice that had been given
since David B.. Hill, two years ago, re
ferring to McCullagh's deputies, jaid: "If
any man attempts to stop you from vot
ing take a club and knock him down.".
Mr. Croker's advice was given la the
course of a discussion of the political out
look." In whierr he said Bryan Was sure of
election if the Republicans did not Eteal it
from him. . - \- Â¦
"Bryan will not only carry New York
State." said >i r . croker. "but he will carry
it by a big majority, and he will run the
same way all over the country. He will
be elected as certain as his name is Bryan.

I am not asking what men did in 18DG
or what they "are going, to do in 1904. I
am Interested in what they are doing now.

In 1896 and. I am not complaining about
those who came back. I have always be
lieved that : a . man's , vote was his < own ;
that he ought to use It according to his
Judgment and' conscience and that he
ought to be above his party all the time,
and I never find fault with any nan who
conscientiously differs from me on a pub

At the meeting in the academy, Mrs.
Bryan occupied j a : seat in a. private Vbox.
The me'eting was held under the auspices
of the Brooklyn Democratic Club, which
as an organization ' supported the Palmer
and Buckner ticket In; 18%. In beginning
his speech Mr. ~\ Bryan made c brief refer
ence to the club's history, saying he was
pleased to have their support at this time.
Park, under the auspices of the Hebrews
of the Kast Side, was a great success.
The attendance was | enormous, and the
! people were so enthusiastic in their re
ception that it was difficult to secure
quiet sufficient to allow Mr. Bryan to pro
ceed. Mr. Bryan addressed himself es
pecially to the Hebrews, saying that he
was glad to have the chance to address
that race which had produced Solomon,
the wisest, and Moses, the greatest law
giver. He discussed briefly the issues of
the campaign, ". saying the Republicans
were amending all of the ten command
ments. As for himself, he wanted to see
the land filled with happy homes and not
with Rachels weeping for their children.
He- was, he said, glad to see so many
loyal to Democratic principles,: for, he
Â«aid, Democracy teaches us the equality
of all men and Inculcates civil and relig
ious liberty. This "country had drawn to
itself the best blood of the. old-world and
Mr. Bryan said he did hot want^-ihooe
who had come to feel that they had made
a mistake. . v * â¢ .
From the 'park meeting there wai* an
other rush to the Academy of < Music in
Brooklyn. Mr. Bryan was whirled away
from the park and for many squares
through the Jewish quarter his way was
(lined with people and by fire
works and .loud acclaim. â¢ . â¢ Â»
to defend your own lights is to- recognize
the rights, of others."
The demonstration in Brooklyn* was.
one of the largest political outpourings in*
the history of the borough. Over 100
bands furnished music and It Is estimated
that over 100,000 people in Brooklyn heard
j and saw the Democratic candidate speak
to-nlght. There were eight different pa
rades in the borough and it is estimated
that altogether 4Q.000 people were in line.
Fireworks ; flamed until midnight from a
dozen different stands and Greek fire was
everywhere. A small army of policemen
kept . the crowds In order . and twenty
mounted officers met Mr. â¢ Bryan's party
at the bridge entrance and acted as es
cort for the remainder of Â£he evening. As
the Bryan party approached the Academy
of Music bombs and skyrockets were set
off in front of the borough hall, and. filled
the sky with clouds of colored stars.
Music broke forth from a. dozen bands,
and the throngs of people- in the streets
cheered and shouted themselves hoarse. I
The Academy was crowded with an en
thusiastic audience and thousands of peo
ple who wished to hear 'the Democratic
candidate could not be admitted. iWhen
Mr. Bryan appeared on the , pjatf orm the
crowd went wild with applause, and it
was fully, ten minutes before sufficient
quiet prevailed to allow the speaker to
proceed. Mr. Bryan spoke for thirty min
utes, being frequently interrupted by'ap
plause.
Senator Wellington of Maryland, fol
lowed Mr. . Bryan, who, as . soon ; as his
speech was ended, started for the Park
Theater, where he addressed another
large gathering. After leaving the Park
Theater Mr. Bryan made a, dash for the
Eastern district of-Brookjyn, arriving at
the Palace Park Rink about 9:15 o'clock.
-Before * he arrived there was ; a parade of
6000 Democrats with twenty bands. At a
quarter to 10 Mr. Bryan arrived at Lie
derkranz Hall, where there .was another
parade and more' bands.: At Military Hall,'
the next stopping place,, there was a pa
rade and twenty-seven bands to greet Mr.
Bryan. It was nearly 11 o'clock when the
candidate ', reached Â¦ Hall. . This ; was
a labor meeting, and Edwin Markham; the
poet, and Controller^ Coler , had addressed
the gathering before ' Mrl . Bryan arrived.'
From Arion' Hall^ Mr. \ Bryan was driven
to" Sell waben- Hall." - - .- â .
Mr. Bryan's meeting In Hamilton Fish
" 'You cannot have empire without Its
attributes, and that means a practical
revolution- of our forms of government
and an abandonment of the beliefs which
the fathers held when they established
this Government In 1776.'
"That Is the opinion of your own Sena
tor Depew only two years ago.- Your
President stated only three years ago that
forcible annexation was criminal aggres
tion and contrary to our code of morality,
and we say; now what they â¢ said â¢ then,
that â¢ It Â¦ means a revolution in' govern
ment;'It means the abandonment of bur
Ideals; It means that adoption of colonial
policies against which . bur ; forefathers

â¢That was two years ago. Now the Re
publicans are advocating an imperial pol
icy. Let me show you what Mr. Depew
said on that Imperial idea: â¢
"I want to show you what Mr. Depew
(aid only two years ago. An army of 100,
000 was then toeing talked of, and he said
It would take more than that, if y;e car
ried out the colonial policy. He said: ,'It
would mean the Increase of our army to
150.000. more likely to 200,000, men; it would
mean the increase of our annual expendi
tures to double what they are now." â¢ -
In his Coblesklll speech Mr. Bryan
quoted Senator Depew on the army ques
tion, saying:
Mrs. Bryan accompanied her husband
during the day, and she received almost
bs much. applause as he did when she ap
peared, before the crowds assembled to
hoar him. She was also presented during
the day with many handsome bouquets of
roses and chrysanthemums. Elliott Dan
forth and Mr?. Danforth were also aboard
the train during the day. As a rule greater
enthusiasm was manifested at the emall
er places than on Mr. Bryan's first tour
of the State, and the crowds were gen
erally large In proportion to the popula
tion. Of the^day meetings that at Kings
ton was the longest, as It was one of the
most enthusiastic. Haverstraw ' and West
Nyack also received Mr. Bryan most cor?
fllally.
The day's tour was first along the head
waters of the Susquehanna River, and
then back through the Catskllls and do"wn
the Hudson on the west side of that river
to'- Weehawken; thence across the river
and across Manhattan Island into Brook
lyn. All the speeches except one ' were
made In the State of New York, the ex
ception being that at Little Ferry, which
Is In the State of >few Jersey.'
Beginning at Bainbrjdge, in the Interior
of the State, at 9 o'clock in the morning,
he spoke In succession at Svdney, Una
dilla, Oneonta, Otega, Schenevus, Coble
ekill, Voorheesville, Delanson, Ravena,
Coxsackie. Catskill. Saugerties. Kingston,
Highlands. MarlborcTugh. Cornwall. High
land Falls, Haverstraw, West Nyack and
Little Ferry. In New York City he made
one speech at Hamilton Fish Park, .on th%
East Side, and in Brooklyn during the
night he made eight speeches, making :
thirty in all for the day and night. '
NEW YORK, Oct 29.-"Anfl I am feel
ing tolerably well. I thank you." This
was Mr. Bryan's response when told to
night that he had made thirty speeches
during the day, and thus broke his own
record for speechmaking. As a rule the
speeches were not so long as on most .oc
cadora, but they exceeded In number by
nine or ten those of any previous day
during the present campaign and by
three the highest number made In the
campaign in any one day In p 1836.

rica. This was not the nrst experience of
the young Prince in active service â expe
rience that is rare for royalty. When the
British were subduing the erratic King of
Ashanti this royal sprig was with them
in the. field, and was a credit to himself
all through, the .^campaign. He was a
product of Welllnprffcn School and Magda
len College. Oxford, and in his university
days was the most easily approached
tuft in th<Â» school. His humor was Irre
pressible, but his hardy work as an ath
lete, together with his Teuton blood, in
clined to a life of just such activity as he
found at the scene of war. The Prince's
mother is the second daughter and the
fourth child of. Queen .Victoria, hence
Christian was her Majesty's grandson. He
was 22 years old on April 14 last.

â¢LONDON.. Ocf.29.-The City Imperial
Volunteers, who arrived at Southampton
rrom South Africa. -Saturday on the Brit

-train .this -morning, marched through Lon
don streets packed ' by thousands
and received a' tumultuous greeting. Such
a demonstration . was probably never | be
fore 'evoked fcr such a small body of vol
unteers. -The postponement o'f . London's
welcome 'diminished, the -'number of spec
tators, but the enthusiasm, could scarcely
liave been more general or genuine.- Eariy
in tho day Queen Victoria sent a message
to the returning troops welcoming them
and -.inquiring as tQ. their . health. The
Prince of Wules came to town and viewed
the proces-sion from Marlborough House,
ine other royal personages, watching the
little band of men in khaKi uniforms were
Princess Louise, the Duchess of Argyll
and '.Prince Kd-waYu of jSaxe- Weimar, wno,
with many other distinguished people,
had taken. up positions of [Vantage early
fn tho morning. Tne clubs in Jt'iccadilly
presented an unusual spectacle. Hun
dreds of women were at the windows,
tnese aacred precincts having thrown
open .their uooid in Honor of the great oc
casion. All along the line of match there
were festoons 01 flags and, other such de
vices, presenting a. brilliant spectacle,
though as a matter of fact the decora
tions had been up since Saturday and had
been drenched with Sunday's rains, whlcn
had .not 'improved the- colors.
Field Marshal Lord .Wolseley, com
mander-in-chief of the forces, issued a
special army , order this afternoon, ex
pressing'the high appreciation which- the
patriotic services ,of the City Imperial
Volunteers and the gallantry and soldier
ly qualities of all ranks had afforded him
and offering the volunteers in behalf of
the British Army a cordial welcome home.
In addition to the City Imperial Volun
teers themselves .there were in the pro
cession the bands of twelve volunteer reg
iments and 24,000 regulars and volunteers
lined the route. Among, the most interest
ing features of the display were the pres
ence in the procession of the invalided City
Imperial Volunteers in carriages Hying the
lied Cross flag and the. assemblage at a
conspicuous point in Fleet" street of ihe
survivors of the Balaklava charge. The
locomotives which drew the City imperial
Volunteers' train from Southampton were
respectively named "VictoriM," â¢â¢Rob
erts," "Powerful'* and "The Maine." To
the last the invalids were intrusted.
The great throngs proved unmanage
able and -the police and soldiers, were
quite unable to stem the ugly rushes. The
crush of the populace became to terrible
at the Marble arch that the people broke
through the cordon and when the field
was again cleared forty persons requiring
the aid of the -ambulance surgeons were
left lying on the ground, several puffer-
Ing from serious injuries.
In narrqw Fleet street the 'crowds broke
downfall the barriers, and sightseers, sol
diers,' police and City Imperial Volunteers
wenS*mlxed up in a confused mass, from
which the volunteers had to be finally ex
tricated. In single file. . â¢ â¢ = â¢ â¢
Along the whole length of Fleet street
the scenes could be only likened to a con
tinuous football scrimmage, but* it was
even more exciting. . Shrieks and g-roana
filled the air, people were hurled to the
ground and trampled upon. Life guards
on horse back were swept off and Jost
in the strugglingytnass of humanity after
impotent struggles to stem the .pressure
of the semi-Danic-!=tricken mob. Some
of the in5urles sustained are so very seri
ous it' Is feared they will" prove fatal.
A fractious cavalry horse Stampeded
the crowd at Ludgate Circus and fifty
persons who were .wounded had to be
attended- bythe ambulance corps.
The list of casualties among the wel
coming multitude was longer than that
of the whole corps in its twenty-six en
gagements in South Africa. Partial re
turns from the hospitals, and, nollce sta
tions indicate that more than 200 were
badly hurt, three or four being killed. â¢
There were 4000 police and 22,000 troops
on duty along the line of march, but they
were unable to manage the Â¦ crowds.
"Women and girls fainted and. were tram
pled ufider foot. - Stands overloaded with
Bightseers fell in. Twelve persons but of
thirty who were riding on top of a mail
wagon whose wheels gave way sustained
broken bones. A man who was leaning
over the parapet of the roof of a four
story building lost his balance and fell
upon a group of women, killing one and
hurting two others, but walked away ap
parently uninjured. Many of the soldiers
on the line of march were hurt in com-

bats with' the crowd. "Altogether London
had a wild day, with much fun and, un
fortunately, a deal of grief In many
households because of accluents.
Indeed the only surprising feature Is
that the 'casualties were aot- twice as
numerous, for when night fell the streets
of London would have done credit to tho
commune. .It was a scene of unchecked
saturnalia that met the 'eye. Fighting
'and -swearing throngs fought valniy
nmong themselves for the right of way.
More than a thousand people were
treated by the Ambulance Corps, although
in most cases the Injuries Â¦ were not serl-,
ous.' There were, however, many cases
where the 'injuries were serious and it Is
not unlikely , that there will be other
deaths. Two men fell from a scaffold In
a .building In Finsbury Circus and both
were killed. Â¦ Â¦.â¢.*.'
Half an "iiour was needed to make ,a
hundred-yards' progress along the Strand,
and the feat could only be accomplished
at -the risk of life and limb. A few iso
lated policemen In evidence were borijo
helpless upon the tide of patriotic enthusi
asm whose Invariable characteristic was
drunkenness, partial or complete.
The. night was a repetition- of "Mafekins
Klght"- without the redeeming excuses of
that celebrated .orgy. London th^ turned
.over to the worst elements of r* popula
tion. VVomen were insulted, kissed pr
thrbwn down with impunity in' street
fights. Pursued at the sweet will of In
ebriate brawlers from the sidewalks*, they
streamed . along .historic .thoroughfares
shouting, sobbing and brandishing pea
cock feathers with insane depravity.
Â¦ Many- -of them offered no exception to
the rule of drunkenness. .
Countless different uniforms of soldiers
of the empire, regulars; volunteers and
colonials, added vivid color .to an extraor
dinary spectacle, the like of which was
never witnessed In any American city.
I In Justice to the heroes of the demon
stration it should be said that few of
them participated in the night's celebra
tion. Indeed, they seemed to be almost
forgotten in the general desire to takÂ»; ad
vantage of unbridled debauch and the de
fiance of all law, order and decency.
;"\Vithfthe exception that the volunteers
were rather browned, there was little in
their. appearance. to show that they were
returning from a hard . campaign. Their
new khaki hats, served out- at Southamp
ton, gave the men a disappointingly spick
and span look, though the lackof align
ment, irregularity of marching and the
frequent substitution of canes : for lost
rifles sufficed to distinguish them from the
volunteers fresh from the training camps.
A captured Boer flag, carried In the
center of the column, elicited great en
thusiasm, thunderous applause going up
as this , trophy . of victory was borne
triumphant through the crowds. A driz
zling rain, which fell as the procession
started, by no means detracted from the
warmth of the welcome extended to the
troops. - Â¦ . -
The march was broken by stopping at
the site of the Temple Bar, where he
Lord Mayor, Sir Alfred Newton, wel
comed the return of the' regiment he
originated: at Ut. Paul's Cathedral, where
there was a short thanksgiving- service
and at the Guild Hall for the civic recep
tion. -
After an eight hours' march the. volun
teers sat down to a course dinner at the
headquarters of the Ancient and , Honor
able Artillery of London, where .Lord
Wolseley and many other notable persons
received and addressed them. After tho
usual, loyal toasts. Lord Wplseley, ;.re
sponding for "The Imperial Forces," read
the following telegram he had received
from .Queen Victoria:
"Please assure the. City of London Im
perial Volunteers that I heartily share In
those feelings of joy and thankfulness
which have been evidenced In the en
thusiastic welcome accorded them to-day. :
Tell them with what pride and Joy I have
received the reports of. their soldier-like
conduct during the dangers and. hardships
of a trying campaign. â¢
VWhile Joining in- the. happiness of the
many relatives and friends who celebrate i
the . home-corning of their dear^ ones, I
deeply sympathize with those who look
in - vain- for them who, alas! no longer
stand ' in the ranks of their comrades. I
also, myself, .have to grieve over the loss
of a dear and most gallant grandson, who,
like so. many of -your companions, has
served and - died for his Queen and his
country."-
The members of the corps then sepa
rated. They had' to muffle themselves in
their overcoats and to use other disguises
in order to avoid recognition ; by the
crowds. As it was, several were nearly
pulled to pieces by the rough , embracing^
and handshakings of drunken .' men.

Towne, Presidential nominee of the
Populists, are not. It appears, so
blinded by the heat and turmoil of
the. campaign as to lose sight of
their .material Interests in the. fu
ture. They have their eyes upon
the .vast' undeveloped resources of
the Philippines and purpose getting
in on the ground floor, as It were.
It was learned- in this city to-day
froA an authority whcme reliability
cannot be questioned -that Messrs.
Bryan and Towne have engaged
one Edward. Lewis of Duluth to re
pair to the Philippines immediately
after the election, no matter how
the election results, and locate and
secure legal title to mineral lands
there in their interests.
Mr. Lewis is a prominent mining
Â¦; 'expert and /prospector of Iguluth,
well' known, who admits his en
â¢ gagement. Mr. Lewis is to locate
and prospect desirable mineral
properties, . the location of which
Messrs. BryVin and. Towne are said
to have been advised by their Kill
pino correspondent*.
V.f ' London witnessed an .extraordinary spectacle at the reception
to the City Imperial Volunteers yesterday. Four thousand police
22,000 troops -were unable to preserve order. Several persons
were killed and hundreds injuredâ a longer casualty list than that

Jesse D. Olmstet! was chairman and!
prominent Republicans occupied the stago.
There was music by Company C band and ,
campaign songs by the Excelsior quartet.
Mr. Coombs spoke on the general issues
of the campaign. He reviewed the sub
ject of free silver and talked at length of
"imperialism" and its horrid specter/mili
tarism.-and of the false patriotism of the
Democracy. He outlined his policy in
favor of the extension of rural mail deliv
ery and' said he would labor to more thor
oughly dot the rural districts with mail
boxes. As to the election of United States
Senators by direct vote, he would support
such a movement. His speech was full of
vigor and aroused a kindly feeling among
his hearers. He closed with a high tribute
to the administration of . President Mc-

SAN JOSE'S GREATEST RALLY.
Magnificent Reception to Messrs.
Loud and Shortridge.
SAN JOSE. Oct. 29.â The largest Repub

night. Every portion of the county was
represented and the greatest enthusiasm
was shown. The Alliance Club of Oak
land, commanded by Colonel S. J. Taylor,
and the Young Men's Republican Clul%
under Captain H. Keck, with a band,
came down to participate in the celebra
tion. The Oakland clubs, the local Rough
Riders and the Army and Navy League
made up a torchlight procession. The
streets were lined with people.
A crowd of more than 2500 persons
thronged the Auditorium and hundreds
Â¦were 'turned away. It was the greatest
throng -that ever attended a political
meeting here. This was the ovation ten
dered to Congressman E. F. Loud and S.
M. Shortridge, the speakers of the occa
sion. M. A. Southworth was chairman of
the meeting. After a few remarks, he in
troduced Congressman Loud. When the
applause subsided, Congressman Loud
told of the unexampled prosperity the na
tion was now enjoying and of the success
ful achievements of the Republican party
in the past four years.
"It has kept every pledge and fulfilled
every obligation." he said. "The financial
center of the world has been removed
from London to New York, and that city
now for the first time is fixing the price
of its own securities. The balance or the
world's trade Is in favor of this country
by a $15,000,000,000 margin.
"In this campaign the Democratic party
had no fixed issue. Free silver and free
trade, their former principles, they refuse
to discuss, and they are trying to ride
Into office by raising an issue unfamiliar
to the American peopleâ that of 'impe
rialism.' "
Mr. Loud concluded appealing: to the
people to uphold the administration and
to sustain the noble work of President
William McKinley.
Samuel M. Shortridge followed Con
gressman Loud, and his reception was no
less enthusiastic than that accorded Mr.
Loud. Mr. Shortridge in an eloquent
speech of an hour and a half dealt with
the issues of the campaign. He brought
greeting from Southern 'California and the
San Joaquin Valley, and was confident the
electoral vote of California would be cast
for McKinley.
A reception and banquet were tendered
the speakers and visiting clubs after the
meeting.

SANTA ROSA, Oct. 23.-Mre. Teresa
Bell filed suit in the Superior Court here
to-Â£ay against R. Porter Ashe and the
Ruinart Stock Farm. The action is for
restitution and possession of the big stock
ranch Just south of the town of Kenwood
and about fifteen miles southeast of this
city.
Senator Ashe, who is the principal own
er of the stock farm corporation, rented
the ranch from Mrs. Bell for a term of
years and was to have paid the first ren
tal installment of $1000 to the plaintiff
on the first day of January last. He
failed to make this payment, Mrs. Bell
alleges in her complaint, and she now
asks for the possession of the property
and JSS3.63 due for rent.
The ranch contains 1S66 acres of land
and is one of the best and most valuable
properties In this county. It is the con
solidation of the old Druaimond, Xunn,
Wilson, Johnson and Crosby places.

SAN JOSE, Oct 29.-The divorce suit of
Seymour Story against Margaret Story
promises some sensational developments.
A baby girl figures in the case. Mrs.
Story declares it is theirs, while Story
maintains it is a borrowed infant, and is
to be used simply to extract some hard
earned dollars from him for the support
of itself and mother.
The record of the trials and tribulations
of the Storys reads like a novel. Story
was a prosperous orchardist near Morgan
Hill live years ago. Being a widower, he
sought a wife through an Eastern mar
riage bureau. By this means he won a
wiaow with an almost grown daughter.
As soon as they arrived at Morgan Hill
he deeded his new helpmeet one-half of a
fifteen- acre fruit ranch.
Then the fun began. Mrs. Story, the
plaintiff alleges, made the old orchardist's
life so unpleasant he wag obliged to leave.
She took full possession of the ranch. Ev
ery time he went near the place he was
arrested. First it was for disturbing the
peace, then for battery, assault to kill
and burglary. He cleared himself of these
charges.
There was a mortgage on Story's ranch,
and his son-in-law. A. J. RockeV took it
up. It was foreclosed and an order se
cured from court for ousting Mrs. Story.
She refused to go, and when a Deputy
Sheriff went to eject her he found her ap
parently ill, in bed, with a healthy Infant
beside her. Two doctors' wero at her bed
side, but they refused to confirm her
etory. When she became convinced the
deputy was going to move her anyhow
she dressed and left with the infant.
Story then brought guit for absolute di
vorce on the ground of cruelty. He de
clared there were no children.
To-day Mrs. Story filed an answer to
the divorce suit. She claims a baby girl
is the result of her marriage with Story,
and denies all the charges made. She
wants the sale of the property to Rockel
adjudged fraudulent and the estate to be
held in trust for the support of herself,
the baby and Story.

STOCKTON. Oct. 29.-M1S8 Mary
Iraser. the daughter of Banker
P. B. Fraser. at whose Instance
she was incarcerated in an insane
asylum, is to-night free. and. in
the eyes of the law. legally competent to
manage her own affairs. This ends the
sensational fight for this young woman**
liberty. The father and her brother, Al
fred Frascr. bad up to Saturday won on
Â«>vcry point, including the finding of the
Si.tte Lunacy Commission, and the broth
er was so satisfied with the situation that
he is alleged to have intimated that some
of those active in espousing his sister's
< ause would hear frcm him. Rumors v.ere
al-road Saturday that the girl was to be
removed from *he city and at an early
licur yesterday morning her attorney se
euied a writ of habeas corpus from Judge
Budd, returnable at 2 o'clock this after
t.oon. compelling the asylum management
in produce her in court to-day.
The option of receding from their posi
tion or defending it in court put a new
phase upon the case and changed any
plans Â¦which the father and brother may
nave previously formed. Banker Fraser
agreed to relinquish his guardianship in
favor of Mrs. R. B. Parker, the girl's
grandmother, and it was tacitly under
stood, it is said, that there would be no
opposition to the habeas corpus proceed
ings or the young lady's restoration to
competency. i
By consent of her father. Miss Fraser
was removed at 9 o'clock this morning
from Clark's Hospital to the home OT
Mrs. R. B. Parker, vhere she prepared
to come into court. The habeas corpus
case came up at 2 o'clock this afternoon.
MiÂ«s Fraser was on hand fifteen minutes
br-fore that time, having come to the
courthouse with Mips Alice Mills*. The
two stood talking In the corridor, and
while ihey spoke in a very low tone, they
exchanged smiles frequently. Miss Fraser
looked well. She had not lost in weight,
but appeared somewhat pale from he*"
confinement. She was attired from head
to foot in a fashionable tailor-made suit
of black. She did not wear the mannish
costume she previously affected and the
big broad heeled shoes had given way to
conventional footgear of patent leather.
When Judge Budd appeared. Miss
Frsser came in and took a seat behind the
rail. Soon afterward P. B. Fraser, her
father, came in. He glanced around and
then went over and sat down beside his
daughter. He was the first one to speak
and father and daughter exchanged a few
words is a low voice.
A. L. Levlnsky appeared for Dr. F. P.
Clark, superintendent of the Pacific Hos
fltal. where Miss Fraser was confined.
If made his return in formal terms, stat
ing that as one of the respondents he pro
duced the body of Miss Fraser in court.
In effect, the return practically stated
that Miss Fruer was still incompetent,

alleged forger, bigamist and "masher,"
who arrived from 6an Francisco yester
day afternoon in charge of a police detec

station, where he is confined. This eccen
tric individual seems to glory in his con
quests over women. One of his first acts
on getting settled in the city prison waa
to write a letter to one of his deluded vic
tims up north and then to make himself
comfortable. The fellow appears to have
the .'utmost confidence that none of the
women he betrayed will appear against
him, and he laughs at the suggestion that
any charges of- bigamy will bo filed
against him. The officers attach but lit
tle Importance to this, aa they believe that
they nave more than enough evidence to
hold him for forgery. Joyce himself does
not deny that he passed the bogus checks,
but seems to regard the whole matter as
a Joke. He was temporarily embarrassed,
and this was the easiest way out of his
difficulty.
* The married woman who wrote the com
promising letter to Joyce has not yet been
located, but the police have hopes of find

for her and she has been traced to the
MIddleton ranch, south of Napa. where
she stopped early this morning for her
breakfast. Miss Wende borrowed $1 from
a Bectlon employe. She walked all tho
way down the railroad track and said she
was going to the Good Templars' Home at

place is to the effect that she nad not puÂ»
in an appearance there. It is thought that
she. boarded a boat in Vallejo to-day and
went to- San Francisco.
Mr. and Mrs. Collins are deeply grieved
over the girl's action and cannot account
for it, as she had all the comforts that a
home could afford. Miss Wende was a

was misquoted when reported as saying
"California bred no good race horses." He
was deputized by the firm of Burns &
Waterhouse to purchase a farm, if a suit
able one could be obtained, that firm

raised in that section of the country might

AUSPICES OF THE COLUMBIA ATHLETIC CLUB.
AL NEILL will appear before the
San Francisco public on "Wednes
day nisht in the ring of the Co
lumbia Athletic Club at Wood
ward's Pavilion. Since his short
fight- with Jack Moftattâ an unexpected
victory for himself, due to the untimely
accident which forced Moffatt out of the
ringâ Neill has not been in the public eye.
He says he is now out to redeem himse.lf.
During the last few weeks Neill has been
working himself into condition, driving
the surplus flesh and adipose tissue out of
his system. He appears to be in good
shape.- At any rate he says he Is, and
seems anxious to meet Ben Tremble, the
young Los Angeles fighter with not much
of a past but many hopes for a bright
fistic future. , Tremble has the advantage
of Neill In weight, but this is offset by
the ring experience of the latter.' 'Â¦
If Neiir is victorious in this fight with
Tremble he will go East and look for
honors In a larger field. Toby Irwin, who
also. .fights on Wednesday night, is con;
templating the same trip. Besides the
Neill-Tremble mill the Columbia Club will
give two preliminaries, which are sure to

LOWELL BEATS
THE LICK TEAM
Single Goal Prevents Third
Tie For These Crack"
Elevens.
The Victors Outplay Their Opponents
Although the Score Shows a
Single Touchdown for"
Each Team.
The Lick and Lowell elevens settled
their football difficulties yesterday at the
Sixteenth and Folsom street grounds.
Five times these young gridiron athletes
have pounded one another for nothing but
youthful glory. The series was originally
scheduled for the best two out of three,
but so evenly were the teams matched
that two of the games ended in ties. The
knot is now cut and Lowell wears the
prize.
From first to last the game had a Low
ell tinge spread all over it. Lighter, but
faster, this team outplayed the Licks at
every point of the game. Especially
strong; was Lowell on defense, the LicK
team never \making any headway when
bucking the red and white forwards. Al
though the game was won by a single
goal, the balance of active force and
power always swung to the Lowell team.
In the first half Lowell scored a touch
down by clever work. Were it not for a
series of costly fumbles Lfck would hare
been submerged with touchdowns. Final
ly Lowell, standing on the Lick thirty

the right end of the opposition for a
touchdown. A goal was kicked. In this
half Hamilton, fullback for Lowell, a
clever punter and stanch tackier, dove
through a heap of Lick men after Kern,
who was tearing down the field for a
touchdown. Kern was spilled. "W hen AI
Lean brought Hamilton to it was discov
ered that his collarbone had snapped.
Hamilton's only regret was that his
father might put the ban on his future in
dulgence in the sport. *
The second half opened leisurely enough,
but took on much action 'before many
minutes had. elapsed. Frequent punting
made the game open and interesting.
This is how Lick scored its touchdown:
Pressed to the limit of endurance. Lick,
on the five-yard line, punted, and the
kick was blocked wisely but not welL

Connell picked his way through a scat

JUNIORS DEDICATE
THEIR CIiASS PLUG
Mirth-Provoking Performance on the
Varsity Oval at Stan
ford.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 29.â
The Junior class dedicated its class plug
to-night by a spectacular and ludicrous
performance on the Varsity oval. Fifteen
hundred persons watched the performers,
dressed as warriors of the tribe of "Naw
tee Tu," in their war dances about bon
fires.
The plot represents the tribe, weakened
by the lack of unity, searching for the
fateful hoodoo. The much-hated object is
finally found and condemned to death.
Just before the threatened deathblow is
struck Pocahontas, queen of the "Nawtee
Tus," rushes in and saves the captive.
Woven in were many- local hits, which
gave the ceremony an added: zest. The
most impressive part of the performance
came when the hundred warriors lined
up in a mock football match, chanting
their favorite verses:
Oh. don't be haughty because you're naugrhty.
But board the boat and turn a few.
Remember, brothers, that there are others.
Remember we are naughty, too.
After the ceremony closed a lively rush
ensued, in which the newly decorated
plugs were thoroughly battered.

of the thirty-nine collieries operated by
that 'company are working.
The two collieries not In operation to

TACOMA. Oct. 2U.â A family row over
the division of the estate of the late
Sl&nor* Foil, the noted barytone of the
Royal Italian Opera Company in London;
was taken into court to-day. The estate
is valued at $200,000. Foil's sister. Mrs.
Bessie "Walker of Tacoma, who was re
cently appointed administratrix, brings
action against her nieces, -Lillian F. Har
gear and Bessie L. Hargear, both promi
nent In society here, for an accounting of
property which they hold as trustees. She
alleges that in 1594 Foil intrusted to Lil
lian F. Hargear as trustee and agent a
large amount of bonds, stocks, warrants,
securities, money and other persona* prop
erty
Airs. Walker claims that Miss Hargear
and her sister, who are nteces of Foil, are
about to convert the property into money
and conceal it; in fact, tney have already
sent a large part of it beyond the limits
of Washington. Mrs. Walker says she la
unable to give a complete description of
Foli's property in the hands of the de
fendants tor the reason that they have
secreted a part of It and refuse to account
for it.
The â¢ property consists in part of a
library of great value, including many
musical works; turniture, silverware,
curios, Virginia State bonds worth J50.0W
and other bonds, school and county war
rants or orders, stocks in mining and
other corporations, other securities, and
money on deposit â¢ in â¢ banks and in the
possession of Lillian F. Hargear and Bes
sie L. Hargear and under their control. â¢
By the terms of Signor Foli's will a. leg
acy of 100 guineas waa given to each of
the executors In England. The real and
personal property was to be sold and the
proceeds divided between Bessie Walker,
sister of the deceased; Helen Hargear,
mother of Lillian and Bessie Hargear, and
William -Foil, brother of the deceased.
To-day's suit is the result of a quarrel
between the Walker and Hargear families
over their shares.- Foli is said to have
made large sums In speculations and still
more by fortunate playing at Monte Carlo.

When the body of Keeper McGovern
was searched it was found that his keys
and revolver had been taken from him.
Neither the keys nor the revolver were
found in the pockets of the dead prisoner,
which leads to the belief that they are in
the possession of Flanagan. When he
was taken to â¢ the, police station on the
night of his arrival, October 3, he re
moved his shoes and then called Doorman
Coghlan to the cell. The latter answered
the call and as he opened the cell door
Emerson sprang at him and brought the
heel of a shoe down upon his head, cut
ting it open. In the struggle which fol
lowed It took. the combined efforts of sev
eral policemen to subdue the prisoner.
; NEW .YORK. Oct. 29.-TWO colored pris
oners. In an attempt to escape from the
prison" attached* to" the' Seventh' District
Court,* in? -West'; Fifty-fourth I street, to
day killed Keeper Hugh - McGovern, 51
years' old, ' and probably fatally Injured
George Wilson, 59 years old, a trusty, who
had evidently, tried to aid McGovern. One
of j the : prisoners, . Arthur Flanagan, es
caped; the other, Frank Emerson, fell Into
the yard adjoining the prison and .was In
stantly killed. The prisoners were to
gether in a cell on the first tier.'on a level
with the fourth floor of thfe prison. They
sawed two barrs- in the; lower part Qt the
cell door and got Into the corridor. They
went to the â¢ nearest â¢ window, .about six
feet .from the floor, and. sawed one bar
at the bottom, shoving It out and getting
through. In doing this it is supposed that
they encountered McGovern and Wilson,
killing- one and' wounding the other.
.) The escaping prisoners used their bed
ding for a rope and swung from a win
dow. Flanagan succeeded, in swinging
to the roof of a' car stable adjoining, -but
.Emerson did not make it and fell head
long to a pile of rails,; crushing his skull.
The men must have left their cells several
hours 'before the fact was- discovered. At
4 o'clock Keeper John Brady, who had
been in the ottice all night, went, as was
his custom, to the male prison on the
fourth -floor.'' As he was walking' around
the corridor of tier - No.' -1: he came across
the body of Keeper McGovern. It lay face
downward in a pool of blood, with a great
wound in the head. | Near by lay the pris
oner Wilson, who was still groaning.. A
surgeon, who was- called in, said McGov
ern had been dead some time. He said
Wilson would probably die. Wilson is 59
years old and for two years had been In
the prison, self-committed, as he had no
home. He acted -as a "trusty" and had
the confidence of the officers. They be
lieve he was hurt while aiding McGovern.
Emerson was under bail of $3000 on two
charges of burglary. Flanagan, who had
been employed as a steward In a fashion
able restaurant, also was under heavy
ball for burglary.. It is said a" woman,
name. unknown, came to the prison Sat
urday evenrhg to see Emer3on, and it is
thought she smuggled in a file with which
the bars were cut. The same woman had
prior to that time secured a lawyer for
Emerson. i

Says It Is Essential That a Ruling
Head Be Given China.
WASHINGTON, Oct: 29.â The Russian
Embassador, Count Cassinl, has returned
to. Washington after an absence of some
months in Europe, during which time he
conferred with Count Lamsdorff, Russian !
Minister of Foreign Affairs, concerning
Chinese and other International questions.
He also talked with M. Delcasse, the
French Minister of Foreign Affairs. When
seen at the embassy to-day Count Casslni
said that his visit to St. Petersburg oc
curred more than two months ago, so that
he was not in touch with the latest phases
of the Chinese situation.
Count Cassini says he. observed at St.
Petersburg that the Government was ani
mated by a most reasonable, conciliatory
and moderate . disposition Â¦ concerning
China. There was a desire to avoid mak
ing the crisis the occasion for large pro
jects. In particular he noted both at St.
Petersburg and throughout Europe that
there was a general fueling as to the Iden
tity' of policy between the United States
and Russia, their position being alike on
many points. The death of â¢ Count Mua
vieff, late Minister of Foreign Affairs, had
removed an official who ha,d been a stead
fast admirer and friend of the United
States. And yet. Count Cassini said,.
Count Lamsdorff, the new Minister, enter
tains that same sentiment of -friendship
and admiration for this country.
Referring to Russia's action'in the Chi
nese trouble. Count Cassini said that it
had been considered essential at the out
set that a ruling head be given to China.
The empire was in a deplorable condition
as a result of the uprising and the:Man
chu dynasty seemed weak and Incapable.
With the departure of the Emperor and
the Empress Dowager from Peking the
empire practically was left drifting, and
it was not to be expected that the 400.000,
000 people of China could carrv on such a
vast institution without a head. Russia,
therefore, considered It essential at the
outset to bring back the Enu>eror and to
le-establlsh a Government capable of set
tling affairs. To this end it had been pro
posed that the troops be withdrawn from
Peking, 'as there was little doubt that
such withdrawal would be followed by the
return ot the imperial household Â¦ and a
more speedy conclusion of binding negoti
ation. The Embassador pointed out that
any Chinese negotiations would have to
receive the ratification of. the Emperor of
China. During the Embas^ador's service
as Russian Minister at Peking he became
well acquainted with LI Hung Chang and
Prince Chiner and he speaks In high terms
of their ability and statesmanship. -
Count Casslnl's attention was called to
the fact that credentials of the Chinese
plenipotentiaries gave â¢themâ extraor
dinary power and ratified in . advance
what they may do. â¢ But the Embasgador
smilingly shook his head, saying that un
der the Chinese system it would be essen
tial In the end to secure imperial concur
rence. Â¦.-Â¦- Â¦ Â¦
When asked as to Russia's purposes in
Manchuria, the Embassador said he was
not Informed on the latest phases of th's
branch of the subject and could not speak
definitely. But he remarked that Russia's
great railroad interests leading t Sown to
Port Arthur would have to be protected
There was not the slightest doubt of this.
It was in protecting these " interests, ho
said, that , Russia had been attacked by
the Chinese, and It was only natural and
necessary that Russia would resist these
attacks. The Embassador also observed
that It. was quite natural that Russia
should feel a deep Interest. in Manchuria,
as it bordered on Russia, much as Canada
borders on the United* States, so that any
thing affecting Manchuria came home to
Russia fair more than It did to countries
far remored from that part of the world.
He recalled that France. Russte.' and the
other : powers Interested In China.- had
made analogous declarations against the
dismemberment of China. \ .
CALL BUREAU. WELLINGTON HO

ment for the observance of the principles
which are advocated in the Anglo-Ger
man agreement. ; .
The note is particularly important to
Russia because that Government under
stands fully that the agreement is a di
rect thrust at it. Though reports havo
been in circulation that Russia has-.an
swered the invitation addressed to her
to accede to the instrument, it is stated
authoritatively that this is not the case.
Russia has been awaiting the action of
the United States and it is likely â¢ that
she will be gratified with an American
reply, though she deprecates that at this
stage of the Chinese question two powers
should enter into an agreement of the
character of that which Great Britain
and Germany have signed, especially
when all the nations had mac declara
tions in favor of the Integrity of China
and the preservation of the "open door."
â¢ Great Interest was manifested In official
and diplomatic circles here to-day In a
cablegram, from Yalta, showing that Rus
sia thinks the United States should mako
the first move in the direction of. inter
national arbitration of the entire Chinese
question. Advices received by the State
Department to-day are to the effect that
the Ministers in Peking are rapidly
reaching an agreement relative t<5 the de
mands they shall submit to the Chinese
Commissioners. It is the purpose of the
administration to advocate arbitration
provided disagreement incapable of ad
justment should occur during the nego
tiations, but diplomats here, represent
ing European powers, believe that though
an agreement may be in sight It has not
yet been reached and they predict that
many developments will arise which will
prevent speedy settlement being effected.
In the interest of a satisfactory solution
of the entire question they believe inter
national- arbitration should u<5 appealed
to at once.

GOOD reports come from the Second Congres
sional District concerning the prospects of
the campaign. The district has beeri*a* doubt
ful one in the past,and the Republican's- 'recognized
that fact when selecting a candidate to make the con
test. In nominating Samuel D. Woods they chose a
man whose personal strength and popularity have been
material factors in the contest. Thepeople know, his
ability, his fidelity and his. earnest patriotism. They
are aware he will.be in the fullest, sense of the word
a "representative" of all their local interests and of
their, sentiments concerning great national issues.
Consequently he-will receive not only the Republican
but the independent vote, and all demonstrations of
the campaign give promise of his election by anjjover
whelming majority.
The election of. Mr. Woods will be avbenefit 'not
to his district only but to the whole State. Califor
nia needs such 'men to represent her in Congress and
uphold her interests there. Even more -than, in, for-.
ir,er years does she need such men now. The open^
ing of the great ruarkt-is of the Orient will afford to
California a thousand opportunities to' develop her
industries and expand her commerce. To. fully profit
by those grand opportunities, however, there will be
required. the aid. of governmental direction and super
vision. We will need protection for our industries;
and fo.r the expansion of our commerce we will need
the improvement; of our rivers and_ harbors and the
upbuilding of an American merchant marine far sur
passing that^. which/ now exists. *To '., achieve
those -lueedsVv we .â¢; must have at Washington
progressive '^men/-. I: would be ; an act of tti
grossest ;f6lly ..^to," turn the House of Representa
tives over to : the Democratic party, or even, for a
single'district having the opportunity to elect a-wide
awake, liberal man in sympathy with the administra
tion to turn aside ''from him and- send; to * Washing
ton a man. who will .be able to-do' nothing except to'

mCHANCE TO SMILE.
In the heats of the closing week of the campaign
Some of the followers of tlie opponents of the ad
ministration maybe inclined to disptiif the justness of
the statements concerning our '^prosperity, 'but when
once the ballots have been cast and theWcitenient of
party strife is over all will recognize ;^their '} truth;
Then we shall unite in supporting; whoever" has been
elected by the people and .begin' making pVeparations
for the great festival, so that when the day o^ : Thanks
giving comes one and all will follow theÂ¦recommenda
tions^ of : the President; who, -after- proclaiming
that we ' observe .it -"is a - day -of .thanksgiv
ing: and ;. praise to him who â¢ hqlds rthe nations
in the hollow of.hishand," says: "I recommend' that
they'gather in their several places of worship and de
voutly/ give him . thanks for the prosperity , 'wherewith
he has endowed us,* for seedtime and for the harvest',
for the valor, devotion" and humanity of our armies
and navies, and for all his benefits to us as individuals
arid as a nation, and" that they humbly pray, for^ the
continuance of his - divine favor, for concord ; and
amity with other nations and for. righteousness arid
peace in all our ways." â¢
We can approach the' festival this year with even
more than usual thankfulness, for our -prosperity as
a nation and as individuals has.\been more abundant
than ever before. â¢ As the President has said in his
proclamation: "Labor and the, industries or the peo
ple have prospered beyond all precedent. Our com
merce has spread over the world. Our power and in
fluence in the cause of- freedom. and enlightenment
have extended A over the distant seas. and lands. The.
lives of our official representatives and many of our
people in China have been .marvelously preserved.
We have been generally exempt from : pestilence and
other great calamities, and" even the, tragic visitation
which overwhelmed -the city of ; Galveston made evi
dent the sentiments of sympathy *and Christian charity
by virtue. of which we arc one united. people."
THE THANKSGIVING PROCLAMATION.
PRESIDENT McKINLEY'S proclamation of
our annual Thanksgiving day comes at an op
portune time. While the people are arraying
themselves for the election on Tuesday, and while
party passions are running high, it is well to have th^
thoughts of all recalled to.the .great .festival peculiar
to this country and shared-in by all classes, by which
we commemorate the blessings .that the year has
brought forth. ' - ' - -

THE STANFORD CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.
Editor Call â I have received very many Inquiries from different parts of
the State, asking me to explain the object of the proposed constitutional
amendment affecting Stanford University. The Interest seems to be so gen
eral that I think I ought to reply through the press. I therefore aak your
kind permission to state through your paper to those' Inquirers .'who may be
your readers, and to your readers generally, what the amendment Is and
.what is intended to bo accomplished by. it. . â¢ ; ' Â¦-./â¢"
This. amendment corrects any possible defects In the original founding of
the university. It authprlzes it to receive property by will; arid property
situated In other States and countries than California, and it places In the
hands of the Legislature the discretionary power to exempt personal prop
erty of the. university from all taxation, and real estate from State taxa
tion, but not from county and local taxation. â¢ All this is in consideration for
free tuition to all students of California. ' '
' AS to these matters, the first two are -vitally Important. The original
enabling act was defective in several ways. In, other words; lt'is so drawn
as to prevent the university ' from accepting valuable estates in Australia,
and other valuable property now offered it by will. At present It can take
property by grant only, and that only when situated in California.
The taxation clause Is unobjectionable. Should â¢ the amendment be
passed, it will still be entirely, within the discretion of the Legislature to de
cline to exempt any property whatever from taxation. By the terms of the
amendment, the Legislature Is not In any way permitted to exempt any real
property from county or local taxation outside of the county of Santa Clara,
where- the university buildings are .situated; and in Santa Clara County the
university would be content if the university buildings alone were exempted.
As to the. personal property, the object Is to give tha' Uegislature the discretion
to allow the university to invest 'its in better-paying securities than
Government bonds and other non-taxable securities. In case this permission
is not granted, the State would be ho richer in taxes, while the university
would have less income to devote to free education. The grant of the
founders of the university (and which grant Is confirmed by the amendment)
provides that all education shall be forever free.
The great object of the amendment is to conflrni the grants to the univer
sity and to render them forever absolutely se'eure. beyond the reach of
'doubt or even of litigation. In comparison with that, object the taxation
clause Binks into- insignificance. " DAVIt) S. JORDAN, President.
Stanford University, Oct. 29, 1900. ..
The laboring people of th|s country are too wise to
intrust their interests to a party. which is controlled
by the 'brand of hypocrisy which Hearst and Bryan
represent.
The Examiner programme is of interest only to
the ami~cxpnn?:cn supporters of Mr. Bryan, who have
before them the inspiring spectacle of Hearst's presi
dency of the National Association of Bryan Clubs and
!m*daily deprecation of. a Philippine policy which he
boasted. les< than two years ago, of having origin
ated and forced upon a. Republican administration. . r
As for Mr. Hearst, he is committed to the policy
of holding the Philippines by an army for which the
Filipino* must pay, and compelling the people to stay
where they are and not to come to the United States
z% all. To the exercise of the power to exclude them
we have no objection. .The Examiner said that such
power exists, and it is estopped now from raising a
campaign cry that there is danger of their coming.
The labor vote of the Northern States is indepen
dent and able to take care of itself, and is under, in
telligent leadership, which l<eeps it awake to its in
terests.
That this country has absolute power over immigra
tion, to forbid, restrict, select and regulate it, when
coming from Spain or elsewhere, there is no doubt.
That power is invoked daily at every immigrant
port.. \Ve exclude Chinesejaborers and will continue
to exclude them. Unless Japan voluntarily forbids
emigration of her laboring class to the United States,
we will also exclude them.
In answering the question the Examiner said there
was evidence' that the races in the Philippines would
not move" toward the United States because they h?.d
not done so heretofore, and added: "If they have
not been attracted hither in the past it may be doubted
whether they would be drawn here in the future. But
supposing that with their attention attracted to the
United States by the establishment of American rule
and American commerce among them, they should
begin to move in our direction, it will be just as much
in our power to prevent that movement if the isl
ands became ours as it will be if they remain the prop
erty of Spain."
In the midst of its self-congratulation and of it*
nagging at the President because it charged that he
had not the courage to take and hold those distant
island*, it was interrupted by a question as to the
migration to the United States of the races inhabiting
them. This question was pointed and proper. No
matter v.hat occurs in the internal or external policy
of this Government, the American wage scale must
be maintained. The etsenCe of our national strength
is iiv the "high reward paid to American labor. Our
workingmen of to-day are the independent operators
of to-morrow. Their thrift, temperance and industry
arc due to the feeling of a "sufficient wage for their
toil, and labor without that feeling is of little social
and civic benefit to any country.
7~*HE Examiner is excited lest nailing the flag to
the Philippines, for which it shrieked in 1898,
lead to an invasion of our labor market
from that source. Hearst's two papers were pioneers
in the expansion field.- .They did what they could to
generate public opinion in favor of that policy. The
Examiner nagged at President McKinley by charging
h:m with intending to drop the Philippines, and de
clared that they must be held permanently because
they were "treasure islands" and "it would pay" to
keep them. Admitting that they, must be garrisoned
with troops, the Examiner said that this would not
affect American taxpayers, for the cost would be prop
erly charged to the Filipinos themselves!
This imperial proposition was repeatedly upheld by
the Examiner, and that paper rather prided itself on
the copyright of a plan for pinning the Filipinos down
with an army and making them pay for the pin. â
ABOUT ASIATIC LABOR.
DISCUSSING the exposure The Call has made
of Dibble's career in the Legislature, . Town
Talk makes the strange " assertion: -"That
seems to be hardly a sufficiÂ«it reason upon which to
request the. deJjjat â¢ of a" person seeking to represent
that district in the 'Legislature." ..It argues: "If
Henry C. Dibble is no worse than' the. people whose
support he seeks, it should appear " to be useless to
ask them to repudiate him." " /j. V7; '\
'Had the statement of Town Talk ended there -it
world . have been no more than a mere bit of .irony.
The "if" would have. saved the remark from condem
nation. The article gees on, however, to declare with
some positiveness that the district merits no better
representative' than that- crooked politician. It says :
"Mr. 'Dibble is well known to the people of the
Forty-first. District". He has represented them 1 more
than once. They have elected him and rerelected him.
They know him to'be a professional politician with a
reputation for a long reach: It must be generally
understood by them that hedoes not go to the Legis
lature in the interests of the people. There is not an
act in his whole political career 'which, savors of- a
burning desire to safeguard the interests of the public.
On the contrary, his record' is one of scandal, ancijli'e
has excited the admiration. of the/blacklegs of politics
by.his audacity in the teeth of exposure, and his ability
to earn enough in three months to keep'him for two
years. Yet he appears to enjoy the confidence, of the
voters of the Forty-first District. If he were not their
ideal representative they would not repeatedly send
him to the Legislature. The presumption must be tha^t
the Forty-first is a district of Dibbles, and that Henry
C. is a man after their own heart." . Â¦ .
A statement of that kind is utterly uncalled for. The
residents and voters of the Forty-first Assembly Dis
trict are among the foi emost in San Francisco. They
represent the business,. the. culture and the morality
of the better elements of San Francisco life. The one
fault to be found with them is that in the phst they
have been more or less neglectful of their political
duties. They have not noted the career and the char
acter of candidates cis closely as they should have
done. Tlie Call has confidence that no considerable
number of the voters of that district have any alliance
or sympathy with crooked politicians. It is for that
reason The Call has directed their attention to Dib
ble's reputation in politics and pointed out some of the
notable features of it.
When the subject is fully considered it; will be seen
there is no justification whatever for the slur that
Town Talk has put upon the Forty-first District. As
well, might all New. York be condemned for the
shameless frauds committed by Tammany Hall, or a
3?rge part of San Francisco be denounced as a partner
of Kelly and. Crimmins. Crooked. schemers are not
easily kept out of politics, but experience proves that
when once public indignation has been aroused the
crooked one lias to hunt the slums and hide in obscur
ity for a timfl. That has been the record which shows
the rule in American politics, and The Call is conn
cent the vote in the Forty-first in this election will
prove no exception. to it.

we did not admit to citizenship and
which, we governed I without their con
sent. I am satisfied that our new terri

constitution; that such of their population
as is fitted for citizenship will receive
it, and that when the territories shall be
come, fitted for statehood they will .be
taken .Into the Union. .Other Territories
of purs have become States under Just
such conditions and some of them have
been in. that condition for half a century
and still remain so. I do not believe the

-danger whatever of the liberties of Amer

the army from a patriotic desire to serve
their country. It^ls bosh of the worst
sort. The Democratic party has always
believed in an army to uphold the honor
and authority of the country. I am not
going" to. desert such" good Democratic
ground to follow Mr. Bryan.
As a citizen of the State of California I
must refuse my assent to policies which
I consider inimical to the Interests of the
State. I cannot help also feeling an in
terest in the industry upon which the
prosperity of the entire Santa Clara Val

commerce is something we should foster
and not seek , to repress. I see in Mr."
Bryan's election 'and the declarations of
the Kansas City platform a direct men
ace to the fruity industry Of California
and I am satisfied if majority of the fruit
growers of the State, take the same view
of it. ; ' ;; v " '
While I look.npon these more local in

candidate of the Democratic party and to
persons now. temporarily shaping the poU

that they have departed from true Dem

UP-TO-DATE
EDITORIAL
UTTERANCE
AS the clouds alternately gather arid clear over
the Chinese situation, there is a" call to . the
Christian sentiment of the Western nations.
Most of these nations have put Christianity fore
most among the reasons in which they urge their right
to piece and partition China for their own benefit.
The 'United States alone has. maintained an attitude of
dignity and justice, and. President McKinley has stood
inflexibly for equity in the settlement of the afflicting'
issues that have grown out of the Boxer revolt.
The Chinese trouble is strictly of missionary origin.
By this we mean that the presence of Christian mis
sionaries in the Middle Kingdom has caused the out
break. The reason of this is that the introduction oi
Christianity at all to the masses of China requires the
destruction of the Confucian system of ancestor wor
ship, upon which the entire civil polity of that Govern
ment is founded. It will be seen that Christianity, un
like Buddhism and Mahometanism, of necessity stands
for the overthrow of the political, state and civil insti
tutions of China. Neither Buddhism nor Mahomet
anism makes such an attack. The essence of those
two systems does not antagonize ancestor worship nor
any other teaching of the Confucian philosophy.
Each has been found capable of harmonizing with that
philosophy, and for this reason their introduction '.into
China has not been opposed, and has produced no
commotion. They do not fight each other. . Each ad
mits the merits of the other, and they have spread ex
tensively throughout the empire.
But, when this statement of fact is^made, it is an
swered by the treaty made with China in i860, after
the soldiers of France and England had looted Peking
and burned the summer palace. That treaty specific
ally permits French missionaries to buy or rent.mis
sionary compounds in the Middle Kingdom, and to
introduce Christianity there, and, under the "favored
nation clause,"- this right has been claimed and en
joyed by all the missionaries of the Western nations.
Pleading this treaty puts China in the -.wrong. It
makes it appear that that empire deliberately con
sented to missionary privileges and Christian propa
ganda in the Middle Kingdom, and, having. consented,
must abide by all the consequences. This view is held
by American missionaries generally. t It was behind
the recent savage expression of one of them who
attacked President McKinley for his policy of equity,
and declared that American missionaries indorsed the
highly bloody declarations of the Emperor of Ger
many and preferred his policy to that of the President
of this republic.
But against this view may well be urged not only
the circumstances of duress under which the treaty
of i860 was forced "upon China; but certain known
facts as to the treaty itself. It is published, and not
denied, that the Middle Kingdom missionary clause
of that treaty was not in the original instrument as
agreed upon by China and submitted for ratification.
That clause is aÂ» forgery, interpolated by a French
missionary who was employed to cross-translate the
document. China supposed that the original instru-'
ment, void of such clause, was being ratified, but
after ratification discovered the forgery when it was
too late for rectification.
No denial of this charge has been made. The fact
of the forgery is within the knowledge of Europeans
as well as of Chinese. It has been known to the let
tered and diplomatic classes in China. It was discov
ered when Western missionaries began to push into
the Middle Kingdom with the cross in one hand and
a. forgery jn the other."
Looked at from the standpoint of Western morality
and ethics, it is at once apparent that this forgery
nullified all the professions of Christianity and made
it, to intelligent men, a false pretense and a fraud.
Forgery is a crime. It is under the moral condemna
tion of all systems of religion and philosophy. If this
special instance of the offense had been nlade to cloak
only commercial pretensions and enterprise;'the teach
ers of Christianity would have been the first to de
nounce it. If it is known now to them and they not
only stand silent but push the advantage which it
gives them, how can they escape the same condem
nation which would be due to the merchant and trader
under the same circumstances?
In the light of this revelation the diplomacy of
President McKinley and the attitude of this Govern
ment are to the highest degree commendable. They
deserve the instant indorsement of all who call them
selves Christians. The religion of Calvary cannot be
propagated by. the sword, as too many of its mistaken
professors contend, and surely: it cannot avail itseif
of any advantage that may come either from a treaty
made under duress or from one. that has been sophis
ticated by forgery. :;;C. . :* : .i :j

KIDNAPING OF
MILDRED GRAY
CAUSES EXPOSE
Troubles Between Contractor
and His Former Wife
Grow Apace.
She Charges Him "With Having In
structed Keeper of Her I>eceased
Mother's House to Annoy
and Injure Her.
v. â¬ T 8 t cutioa ' abus Â® and Paying of
hired hands to maliciously molest and
annoy her has now. on top of the accusa
tion of kldnaplns. been charged against
George F. Gray, a member of tbe con
tracting firm of Gray Brothers, by his
former wife, Margaret E. Gray. The seiz
ing aad carrying away of little Mildred
oray by the accused contractor Sunday
afternoon was the outgrowth of the old
domestic discord between the child's par
ents. The other charges are resultant
from the alleged methods employed by
Mr. Gray in handling the estate of Mrs.
Gray* deceased mother. Millie H. Web
ster. Though Mrs. Gray had secured tt
divorce from George F. Gray on the
.round of cruelty prior to the execution
of Mrs. Webster's will, in which MrÂ«.
oray and her children were bequeatntd
an e*tata valued at $50,000, it is apparent
that the testatrix retained her confidence
in her former son-in-law, for she named
fcim executor of the Instrument:
This fact has added further complica
tions to the trouble between Mr. and Mrs.
Gray and promises to be productive of
sensational disclosures when the case
reaches the courts for hearing. The will
of the deceased bears date of October 11,
1900, having been executed live days befora
her death. In the will a life allowance
of 525 a month Is devised decedent's sis
ter. Elizabeth Cuthbert. and the residue
of the estate la bequeathed in equal shares
to Mrs. Gray and her children, Mildred
and Harry Webster Gray. Though Mr.
and Mrs. Gray had been divorced about
two years Mrs. Webster named Mr. Gr*ty
as executor of her will. Upon Mrs. Web
eter'B death Gray immediately applied tor
Eptcial letters of administration upon her
estate, which were granted. Mrs. Giay
now accuses him w:th having exercised
iiis authority n_s executor of her mother's
Â¦will to persecute and abuse her and she
demands that he be removed and that
letters of administration upon her dead
mother's estate be issued to her forth
with.
In her petition tor special letters of ad
ministration Mrs. Gray says:
"Ever since the divorce from George F.
Gray your petitioner has not been on
speaking term* with him and George K.
Gray has done everything in his power
to annoy, molest and injure your peti
tioner."
Regarding the conduct of Mary L. Cur
ley, who keeps the boarding-house at 11*1
Pine street, which Mrs. WoCol?r owned
and conducted up to the time of her laat
Illness, Mrs. Gray says:
"Mrs. Curley has usurped possession of
the boarding-house and of all the personal
property therein contained, and Â«he has.
Fince the death of the decedent and prior
to the appointment of George F. Gray 4s
special administrator, illegally collected
rents from the boarders there and is now
carrying on the boarding-house in de
cedent's place- and the is unduly exercis
ing acts of authority in and abou; the
house and property and she refuses to
furnish to your petitioner and her chil
rire:i any food or provision* and is com
pelling petitioner and her children to go
out of the house for their food.
"Mar;' L. Curley Is now doing so under
the guidance and instructions of George
F. Gray, although 199S Pine 6treet was
and is the home and residence of your
petitioner and her children.
"Since the death of petitioner's mother
Mary Lj. Curley has assaulted and used
bodily violence to your petitioner. She
fc'.zod your petitioner by the throat,
threatened to throw her out of the house
and furthermore scratched your petitioner
and would have done additional physical
violence but for the interference of other
parties."
Mrs. Gray further allesres that all the
acts of her former husband, as special
administrator, have been antagonistic tc
her. Private papers and valuable per
sonal property belonging to Mrs. Web
ster. she avers, have beÂ«n taken and con
cealed by Mr. Gray and M-ary I*. Curley.
After the kidnaping of Mildred Gray by
her father Chief of Police Sullivan sug
g-ested to Mrs. Gray that Bhe apply for
relief to Judge Belcher, who had awarded
her the child's custody. Mrs. Gray took
no action yesterday, however, but before
the week is over not only her action to
recover possession of her daughter, but
the prosecution of her proceeding to gain
control of her mother's estate will be m
full blast before Superior Judges Belcher
and Troutt. Judge Belcher will adjudicate
the kidnaping proceedings and Judg-
Troutt will settle the difficulties over tEe
estate.

CAPTAIN E. S. MORINE
DIES AT SANTTABHTM
Well-Known Master in Coastwise
Trade Contracts Illness While
Frozen In on Yukon.
Captain Edgar S. Morine, who died at
the Homeopathic Sanitarium, 2110 Central
avenue, last Sunday night, had been as
sociated with coastwise vessels for several
years. A native of Port Medway, Xova
Scotia, he- early sought a maritime life,
and at 21 passed the British Board of
Trade and became qualified to command
sailing and steam vessels. He became a
citizen of the United States in 1888 and
brought the ship General McClellan to
this port in 1SS3.
Captain Morine was well known in lum
ber circles on this coast and for many
years was engaged on the vessels of the
Simpson Lumber Company of this city and
the Victoria Lumber and Manufacturing
Company of British Columbia. During the
first j?old 4 excitement in Alaska he com
manded roe steamer Yukoner and passed
one winter frozen In on the river. It was
during this period tha.t the symptoms of
the malady that ended his life first ap
peared.- At Nome Captain Morine was
engaged in managing the interests of the
Nome Beach Lighterage and Transporta
tion Company, the stock of which Is
owned principally in this city.
Captain Morine was a prominent Mason,
a member of Mission Lodge No. 169, and
had been an Odd Fellow for many years,
being a member of West Lynn (Mass.)
Lodge No. 63. The funeral will take place
at 2 p. m. to-morrow and is to be con*
ducted by the Masonic order.
AFTER being in continuous service
for thirty-two years and on the
eve of completing her 1717th voy
age the old steamer Gipsy came
to grief on the bar late Sunday
night. It was blowing hard and suddenly
a big sea struck the steamer on the port
bow and a . few seconds later another
roller swept over- the "stern. All kinds of
damage was done and -.some ropes coiled
on deck were swept overboard. TbeBe
swept aft and caught in the propeller and
the Gipsy was as helpless as a hulk in a
cross sea in a very few moments.
The Gipsy Is schooner rigged and with
what sail he could get on her Captain
Leland managed to clear the Seal Rocks.
Danger signal lights were then burned
and In response the tug Reliance went
out and towed the steamer Into port.
"We were on our way from Santa Crua
and when pretty well up a breaker from
the bar struck us on the port bow," said
Mate Richardson yesterday. "The sea
stove In three planks between the first and
second chain plates .and knocked the end
out of the deckhouse. The starboard rail
ing was carried away and almost every
thing movable on deck was washed over
board. Another roller pooped us and for
a few minutes it looked as though the old
Gipsy was gone. Ropes carried overboard
by the water got into the propeller and
we were helpless. Luckily, the tide was
ebb and with the sail we were able to
set we got as far as Point Pedro, where wo
anchored in eighteen fathoms of water.
The tug Reliance came along in answer to
our signals and towed us into port."
The Dulk of the Gipsy's cargo was lime
and some of the casks got wet. For a
time it looked as though "old perpetual
motion" would go up in smoke. Captain
Leland got the smoking barrels overboard
and the Gipsy was once more saved.

STEAMER GIPSY BEING SWEPT BY A BREAKER ON THE BAR. SOME ROPE GOT INTO HER PROPELLER
AND SHE DRIFTED WITH THE EBB TIDE DOWN THE COAST BEFORE A TUG CAME ALONG AND PICK
ED HER UP.
Mrs. Helen Saunders, alias Emerson,
alias Watson, stood at the entrance to the
Hall of Justice yesterday morning with
her purse in her hand, ready to settle with
the landladies she is alleged to have de
frauded, so as to prevent them appearing
against her in Judge Conlan's court. How
many 6hÂ« settled with is not known, Mrs.
S. Bigler of S31 Chestnut street being tho
only one who admitted that she had been
paid. Â¦ She received $17 60 for board and
lodging due since last May. Â¦
Mrs. Saunders later appeared in Judge
Conlan's court on the charge of defraud
ing Mrs. Lizzie Kearns, 1401 Leavenworth
street, out of a month's board and lodg
ing for herself and daughter, a girl about
21 years of agol She was represented by
Attorney Hawkins. The front row of
seats In the courtroom was entirely oc
cupied by ladies, and . when Hawkins
asked for a continuance till Thursday and
the Judge asked all witnesses In the case
to stai'd up so that he could notify them
to return on that day the entire front row
arose, and one old gentleman with gray
whiskers stood up in the rear of the court
room.'-.
Among the witnesses was Mrs. Halght
of 1S13 Clinton avenue, Alameda. She kept
a "bearding house on Mason street, this
city, about ten years ago, and Mrs Saun
ders, who was then known as Mrs. Wat
son, and her daughter left without paying
their board b;ll of $iO. Mrs. Saunders was
at that time arrested- by Detectives Bee
and Ha'rper, b'it Mrs Hai^ht did not
prosecute the case. She owns property in
tan Rafael, but it is homestp.aded.
Mrs. Saunders, it seÂ»ms has set her
neighbors in San Rafael to talking. ehÂ°
having furnished what they look upon as
rood material for gossip. A dispatch
from there says:
"Mrs. Helen M. Saunders, the wealthy
woman of this city who has demanded u
jury trial In San Francisco on a charge
of defrauding an innkeeper, is well known
here. After two days patient waiting
at the postoffice Constable George Agnow
last Friday served the warrant that
brought Mrs. Saunders to San Francisco.
The Saunders residence in tnis city has
long been a hard problem to the local
process servers. Standing in a grove of
tall trees, surrounded by hedges and ap
proached by paths covered with hea.vy
looee rock the place is impregnable and
interviewers and people who hare disa
greeable- papers to serve have learned
that to reach its interior is out of the
question.
"Humor has It that several constables
have camped night after night In the
shadow of the Saunders hedges in the
vain hope of placing a summons in tha
hand of Mrs. Saunders. A year or so ago
a constable after trying to effect a service
for more than a week procured a coal
cart and drove by the place in the even
ing. As he passed he managed to have
his horse become frightened and a sack
of coal was thrown out upon the side
walk. Xot appearing to notice his loes
he drove on for a distance, Â¦when he
Jumped from the cart and ran back. After
waiting a few minutes he was able Lo
serve ilrs. Saunders with tho summons

CANTON. Ohio. Oct. 29.â President Mc-
Kinley to-day was busy with callers and
matters of state. He received reports
from trusted political lieutenants which
made him feel satisfied that his plurality"
In Ohio would be anywhere from 75.000 to
100.000. He expresses himself to friends as
being satisfied beyond doubt as to the re
sult of the election. He said his great
est concern is to have his plurality so big
that Bryanlsm will be eradicated so ef
fectually as not to come before the pub
lic again.
The President enjoyed his drive to-day
In most beautiful autumn weather. He
expressed himself as feeling in the best
of health. He has entirely recovered from
the strain of official duties. There 'is a
movement on here to have McKinley re
main in Canton the night of November 6
to hear the election returns at his Canton
home. He has not decided on this point,
but at present Indications are he will con
sent to stay in Canton at least until No

the cause of a wordy war at to-day's
meeting of the Methodist Ministerial As
sociation. A Prohibitionist on the one
side and a Republican on the other for a
few moments hurled angry words at one
another. The trouble began in the dis
cussion that followed a paper on "Pro
hibition" read by Rev. .\V. K. Bean, pas
tor of the Prospect Park Methodist
Church. Mr. Bean said some strong
things ajrainst the liquor traffic and closed
by declaring:
"The minister should keep before his
people the fact that when the barkeeper
and the Christian vote the same ticket
and by their votes sustain liquor laws
there is no moral difference between the
two." ' ,
In the discussion that followed several
ministers criticized President McKinley
and the administration with, regard to
their position concerning: the army can
teen, and declared that every Christian
should vote the Prohibition ticket. This
was too much for Rev 1 . Will A. Knighten.
a stanch Republican- He jumped to his
feet and asserted with vehemence that
President McKinley was vindicated at the
last meeting Of the General Conference,
when his pastor. Rev. Frank Bristol, said
that the President was the greatest Chris
tian layman in the world. Mr. Knlghten
contended that the remarks made during
the meeting against the President's prin
come when men ought to be loyal to their
come when men ought to be loyal tothelr
ruler and Government.
"Our discipline." said Rev. Mr. Knlgh
ten, "forbids speaking, evil of our magis
trates. I am a Republican and am proud
of it."
"And a saloonman also," added Rev. D
H. Gillan.
. "That is false," retorted the Republican
pastor.
After a short battle of words Rev. Mr
Gillan offered his hand to his Republican
brother, who took it, remarking:
"I will shake hands with anybody," and
the dove of peace . perched upon the as

for supporting the Republican national

The Democratic party has forsaken Its
old idealsâ expansion, for exampleâ sound
Democratic doctrine since the days of
; Jefferson. It has allied itself with Popu
lipts and other enemies of law, order and

upper hand and the platform contains not
one single constructive plank. It outlines
a policy of wanton destruction. It might
be summarized in these words: "We are

A p!ea?!ng Incident occurred haJf-way
throuph Mr. Batrett's address. The beat
of a drum caused every eye to turn to the
entrance of the hall, through which filed
a r.umrx?r of worklnpmen clad In overalls
etvJ carrying "full dinner paile." They
were members cf the Younp Men's Club
of the Fourth District, and were heartily
cheered by the audience. Their leader
handed an envelope to Mr. Barrett, who
after b*-rakinÂ«T the seal stepped to the
front of the platform and. Â«aid:
"I am plad that these gentlemen have

MR. JOHN P. IRISH, who returned on Saturday night from a business trip and about sixty days' campaign oi
the Jtump, in response to a request for an Interview upon the political outlook, said:
VI have no doubt that Mr. Bryan will be beaten by a arger electoral vote than In 1S96.

6. The dash shows & sudden break in the
thought, or is used to set off a parenthet
ical expression. Note carefully Its usage
in printed matter.
7. The mark ? denotes a question, and la
usually written after a direct question;
as, "Where did he come from?" "How
much will it cost?" When this mark Is
used In parentheses It expresses doubt.
The writer intends to question the truth
of the word or name he has just used; as.
"What a brilliant (?) speech he made! 1 '
Here the writer indicates that he Is using
the word "brilliant" in a questionable
senseâ In a sense different from its com
mon meaning.
8. Quotation marks denote the intro
duction Into written or printed matter of
something quoted.
9. The common use of the apostrophe la
to mark the possessive case. It is used*
also to mark the plural of single letters
or figures: as, "Tour 8's and 3's are alike
and your t's and l's are badly formed."
10. A row of asterisks is used to show
an omission. Thus if a -writer were quot
ing and wished to skip several paragraphs
he would insert this sign:
but if he omitted only a few words ha
would use leaders, thus:
11. Be very careful in breaking a word
at the end of a line to divide it according
to its syllables. Do not divide a word at
all unless you cannot possibly avoid doing
so. Words of one syllable cannot be di
vided, and it is scarcely ever necessary to
divide words of two syllables. When it 1st
necessary to make a division follow the
first part with the hyphen; that Is to say.
the hyphen should appear at the end of
the line rather than at the beginning.
12. When two or more words not usually
considered together are used as one name
or qualifying word they are commonly
united by a hyphen; as. a hot-headed
speech, a go-as-you-please gait, etc.
Numbers like the following are usually
written with a hyphen: Slxty-flve. twen
ty-third, etc. Many words once com
pounded' In this way are now written as
single words; as, railroad." schoolboy,
lifelike, etc. -
5. The colon is used before a formal
enumeration of particulars. ThÂ© formal
ity is usually expressed by the presence
of such introductory words as "thus:"
"follows:" etc.
1. Start with your language. If your
sentences "are to the point" you simply
need "tho point." It Is the Involved, tan
gled, cumbersome sentence which needs
special care in punctuation.
2. Insert commas simply where they are
necessary to bring out the correct mean
ing. It la better to have too few than too
many. When in doubt, omit.
3. When you have completed a sentence
âthat is, when you have made a complet?
statement â write a period after It and be
gin the next statement or sentence with a.
capital letter. The period should be use<l
also, after headings, names, addresses,
signatures and other words and phrases
standing wholly alone. Write periods
after the common abbreviations, such as
Mr., Dr., St., LL. D.. Rev., etc.
4. The semicolon indicates a greater
separation than the comma. The latter
denotes a pause in reading that the mean
ing may be clear; the former denotes a
distinct separation or pause in the thought
rather than in the language. Note that
the semicolon is often used at the close
of a grammatical sentence Instead of the
period. It Is the thought and not the
grammar which decides the location of
semicolons.

From a reliable source it is learned that
the Chief Intends to redistrict the city so
that the streets will be more thoroughly
patrolled. The various districts will be
known as "precincts," the same as in the
large Eastern cities. Instead of having
sergeants keeping a watch on the patrol
men lieutenants of police Â¦will be the su
pervising officers. It is the intention of
the Chief, it is understood, to force sev
eral lieutenants, who for years have been
detailed at the several police stations, to
direct the patrolmen, who are now being
looked out for by sergeants. To do this
the Chief, it Is said, intends to ask the
Commissioners to appoint extra lieuten
ant*. It is understood that the beats will
be so divided that it will not be necessary
for a patrolman to climb several hills be
fore he can reach the end of his section.
Several changes are also to be made in
the City Prison as well as in the outside
stations. Since the opening of the new
prison the email force detailed there t.aa
been sorely handicapped by reason of bo
ing forced to asTc the "trusties" to assist
them in locking up prisoners. It Is
known that ihe Chief is bitterly opposed
to the "trusty" system and intends to do
away with it. If his proposition is favor
ably received by the Commissioners at
least a half dozen new places will be cre
ated in the prison. A number of other
changes are contemplated, principally
among which will be the disrating of
some detectives who have grown old in
the eenice. The Chief refuses to discuss
the changes that he intends to make, but
A number of changes are scheduled to
take place In the Police Department. At
to-night's meeting of the Police Commis
sioners the matter will be brought up and
definite action taken. It is known that
Chief Sullivan has had the probable
changes under consideration for some
time, and notwithstanding his reticence it
can be authoritatively stated that he will
t-ubmit the proposition to the Commis
sioners to-night, and ask them to act on
It at once.

of the evening was the enthusiasm with
which Congressman ivahn was received.
His entrance into the hall was greeted
with a perfect storm of cheers and ap
plause. Again, when he spoke on the local
interests that San Frajicisco has in the
election of a Republican national admin
istration he was interrupted by applause
which was turned into cheers, so that he
had to cease talking for a time.
Ccngressman Kahn said that the Nicar
agua canal bill, the bill to provide for the
construction of a cable between San
Francisco and the Philippine Islands,, and
the bill to keep the products of prison la
bor within the boundaries of the several
States in which they were made, were all
favored by the Republicans in Congress
and that the opposition to them had been
found to be made up mainly of Demo
cratic votes. He expected that the canal
bill, which would come before the Senate
in December, would be passed and would
be signed by President McKlnley early
in the coming year. He was also of the
belief that if the bill for the construction
of the cable to the Philippines was passed,
the cable would be made in San Fran
cisco.

delivered by D. J. Murphy, Martin K. J.

boundaries of the district. The population
Is intelligent and progressive. The repre

It v.as common rumor at Sacramento
iuring the last regular session that Wolfe
was "cut for the stuff." It was the gos
sip of Senators that he was ready to
" *tand up" individuals and corporations.
One story was to the effect that he even
t-ought to stand up Herein. Lut failed to
obtain the goods. It is said that Herrin
entertains tne most withering contempt
for any member of the Legislature who
will not '"stay bought." Thirty years ago
Tom Scott, dealing with the Pennsylvania
lawmakers, defined the honest man as
"the statesman who will stay bought,"
ar.d Herria i"-as frequently recalled the
r.efiniticn.
Wolfe had a keen eye In the Legislature

Wolfe is asking- for re-election on the
zrround that he is the party nominee. He
if not the nominee of the Republican par
ty and Republicans are under no obliga

randidacy. He was nominated by corrupt
t>oFses vvho 6tuffed the ballot boxes of the
i<pen primary and thwarted the will of the
people.
Wolfe a.Â«ks for Republican 6upport on
the plea that his vote will assist in the
election of a Republican United States
Senator two years hence. Let the good
people of the Twenty-first Senatorial Dis
trict examine Wolfe's record at the last
regular session of the Legislature to see
If he was not using all the means at his
command to defeat the election of a Re
publican United States Senator. Time and
Bjraln appeals were addressed to him
to support General Barnes or Irving M.
Pcott, illustrious Republicans of San
Krancisco, but he contemptuously replied
that the people of the Twenty-first Dis
trict wanted Dan Burns, and it should be
"Burns or no Senator." Dibble in the As
ff-mbly a-nd Wolfe In the Senate declared
that the motto of the campaign was
'Burns or no Senator." Wolfe is the ab
ject tool of the bosses. He has all the
rontortions of Dibble, without his Inspira

for indefinite postponement by the Finance

the city treasury, to be designated as St.
Mary's square fund, and pledges the board
to appropriate $00,000 more during the next
fiscal year for a like purpose. The passage
of the resolution would result in the re
lease of the original fund of $125,000, now
in litigation, and the city's creditors
would all receive their money.

dinance provides for the Inspection of ani

City Confesses Judgment to -Largo
Amount on Protested Taxes Er
roneously lievied on Bonds
"by Assessor Dodge."
The Board of Supervisors awoke yester
day to a realization of the fact that tho
charter provision relating; to the tearing
up of streets for the laying of rails, plpeb
or for any purpose has never been fol
lowed. It was Supervisor McCarthy who
called attention to the violation of the
charter when the ordinance came 'up for
consideration granting the San Francisco
and Pacific Glass Works permission to lay
a spur track from the Southern Pacific
Railroad track on Harrison street to the
premises of the glass works. McCarthy
stated that in many cases where streets
were torn up it was done by the company
which laid pipes or rails instead of by the
Board of Public Works, as the charter
provided.
Reed desired a condition Imposed upon
the glass company that it keep the streol
on which the spur track is laid in proper
repair. Curtis characterized certain op
position to the permission to lay spur
tracks as Interfering with the industries
of this city. McCarthy then called at
tention to the specific charter provision
which places the power of tearing up the
streets solely with the Board of Public
Works. He moved that the permission
to lay the spur track be granted only on
condition that the Board of Public Works
perform the work of tearing up the street
and the motion prevailed.
The City Street Improvement Company
was granted permission to lay a spur
track from the Southern Pacific Railroad
track on Harrison street into the bloc*
owned by the company.
The City Attorney was authorized to
permit Judgment to be entered against
the city and county of San Francisco in
the actions instituted for the repayment
of taxes and interest thereon at 7 per
cent, paid on bonds under protest, which
bonds were declared by the Supreme
Court of this State to be exempt from
taxation. As a result of this action the
Mutual Savings Bank will receive the
sum of $19,838 39; Humboldt Savings and
Loan Society^ $9210 89; Hlbernia Savings
and Loan Society, $26,324 50: Wells, Fargo
& Co., $3433 51, and H. T. Scott et al.,
$4238.
The total represents the amount illegally
collected by the city based upon the er
roneous assessments on bonds levied by
Assessor Dodge. As a result of Dodge's
blunder the city will be obliged to pay
out a considerable sum in interest on
taxes which Bhould never have been Im
posed. Â¦ : Â¦ . - .

by Board and Enjoyed

Supervisor McCarthy raised his voice at
yesterday's meeting of the board against
what he asserts is discrimination in the
granting of special permits for permanent
street encroachments. He introduced a
resolution, which was referred to the
Street Committee, providing for the re
scinding of all rights heretofore granted
or exercised to erect signs that project
over the sidewalks. The resolution fol
lows: .
WhereM. ThtÂ» board Indefinitely postponed
an ordinance which, among other powers, con
ferred upon the Board of Public Works au
thority to grant certain rights and privileges
to property owners In the erection of street
signs and transparencies,* and
Whereas, As'privileges of this character havt
heretofore been enjoyed by our citizens under
and by virtue of resolutions passed by the
Board of Supervisors ; and
Whereas. The signs and transparencies now
erected and maintained are exclusive and per
mits the exercise of thesa privileges only by
the citizens who obtained authority from thÂ«
Board of Supervisors; and
Whereas, All citizens should have equal rights
and should not be discriminated against, but
arc entitled to all the privileges which others
enjoy by permission of the Board of Super
visors, and In order that all citizens should bÂ«
placed In the same condition before the l&w:
therefore, he It
Resolved, That all rights and privileges here
tolÂ»re granted or. exercised to erect signs and
transparencies be and the same are hereby re
scinded, and all resolutions granting or pro
posing to grant the said privileges are hereby
repealed.
Resolved, That the attention of the Board of
Public Works and the Chief of Police Is hereby
.called to the provision* of this resolution.
McCarthy explained that In deference
to many citizens who had endeavored to
obtain special privileges without success
he believed in rescinding permits hereto
fore granted.
"All citizens are entitled to equal priv
ileges," said McCarthy, "but the" priv
ileges should be granted to every pe
titioner that appears before this board or
else all special permits should be with
drawn."

The operations of the prune combine are the
most Interesting; things In this market at the
moment, and one may hear almost any report
about it on the street. The latest is that the
directors have issued a circular emDOWerin*
packers to buy prunes from anybody outside
thÂ« osbociation in order that all outside lots
may bo thus brought into the combine. Another
is that outside growers in the San Joaqun
district, belns unable to sell their prunes, are
trying to get Into the association. Still another
is that . President Bond has refused to admit
aiij- â¢ more outsiders on the ground that the
association has not storage room for its own
members, every warehouse being full. In
short, one may hear almost any story If he
goes out among the frade.

NEW TORK. Oct. 29.â The stock market
ercwed plainly enough this morning that the
recent headlong speculation has overdone the
prosperous conditions offered by the renewed
outside Interests In stocks. There was a con
cplcuouc absence of any sensational story of
van continental railroad consolidations and
new orean-to-oceaa combinations, such as were
a furor every day last week. Like a toper
the stock market quickly felt the need of the
customary "bracer" and began to fall away In
a mood of depression. People who bought
stacks last week on the strangth of some of
the startling stories current were uneasy this
morning when prices began to ko downward, in
*pite of the absence of Had news and hastened
to iwil. adding to the depression. Among pro
fwsloral traders there was a general feeling
that a reaction was overdue and thus the mar
ket ignored favorable reports and either sold
to realize or put out short lines. The resump
tion of work among: the miners In the anthra
cite region was one favorable factor, putting an
end as it does to a long-etandlng drag on many
Â».idrÂ»h' varied industries and settling the per
sifttent uncertainty as to the final outcome of
th~ controversy. The coalers were heavy. A
preliminary decline in Tennessee Coal uncov
wed a stop loss order, causing a violent break
of four points In the stock and sympathetic
weakness In the whole group. The shutting
<own in some departments of the Federal
Company's plant at Joliet served also to de
jjiess the group. The important specialties and
Industrials showed a rather acute reactionary
tendency, following the highly artificial ad
vance of lÂ£ft week. Declines in this group ran
from a fraction over a point up to S and 3%
l*oints in some of the New Tork stocks. In
the railroad crcup the declines were mod
erate, but a lengthened lit.t fell 1 to 1% points
below Saturday. Northern Pacific was inclined
tj resist the depression all day and In the late
dealings it was run up 2 points from the low
Â«*rt. giving a better tone to the whole market
The systematic rally exceeded a point in a num
ber of cases, but the closing was still below
Katurday's level. Money conditions were dis
tinctly easier and the maximum call loan rate
was 4 per cent. The tone of the time money
market waa also easy. Apparently there waa
no further uneasiness over the future cf the
market. The news of a further shipment from
Australia en Saturday of $3,000,000 in gold fur
thered this feeling. Sterling exchange hard
ened In response to the firmer money market
In London, which vai a result of the operations
of the Bank of England In withdrawing gold
from the open market with the purpose of lift-
Ing the money rate. From Berlin came the
report that the money market conditions have
ceased to excite apprehension, a development
that helps to account for the strength of North
ern Pacific.
The dealings in bonds were large, but the
price was irregular. Total sales, $1,745,000.
United States new fours advani-M % and the
threes and fives rejrteter^d % per cent.

CHICAGO, Oct. 19â Trad* In wheat was
moderatlvely active. December opened UOUc
under Friday at 72%Â©72%o on easy sales, but
rallied sharply to 73%. It was reported that
50 per cent of the crop of Northern Argentina,
equal to 30 per cent of the whole crop of that
country, had been damaged by frost. Added
to this news was a recovery In late cables and
the wet weather here. Shorts covered freely,
and there was also a fair amount of commis
sion house buying. On the bulge scalpers took
fronts.- and other wheat came out on the-ex
pectation of a 2.000.000 bushel increase In the
visible and the slack business on cash. De
cember reacted to 73%c, but upon 'the Issuance
of the visible statement, showing an increase
of 1.335.000 bushels, further buying became the
order of the day and December rallied to 73%
e73%c and closed firm. %Qlc higher.
Corn was quiet and easy despite the wheat
strength, being affected by large country ac
centaaces and slack cash demand. December
closed Hlff^ic down at 34%c.
Oats were dull and neglected, closing %c
hleher.
Provisions were moderately active and prices
were firm on hog receipts, which were under
the estimate and in sympathy with wheat. The
demand for lard by shorts was the feature.
January pork closed 6c higher, lard 6c up and
ribs 2%C6c higher.

GRAFTED SKIN
TO SAVE HAND
OAKLAND. Oct. 2<*.-\VTiat the
physicians in attendance pronounce
to be one of the most delicate skin
eraiting operations ever attempted
was successfully performed this
morning at the Receiving Hospital.
The patient was Miss ? Maggie
OConnoll.' the laundry employe
v.-hoÂ«o hand was so severely burned
in a mangle nt the Oakland French
laundry two weeks ago. Dr. J. C.
Milton superintended the operation,
which was participated in by Drp.
E. N. Ewer, \\\ S. Porter, R. T.
Stratton, Charles Rowe and E. R.
Sill. ...
The accident to Miss O'Connpll
resulted in. the searing of the fiesh
of the palm and fingers of the left
hand. She was put under the care
of Dr. Milton at her home at 833
Thirty-third street, but as there
were no signs of the wounds heal
ing and' her condition was becoming
weaker, to save hÂ«r life skin graft
ing was decided upon. The yc%*ng
sufferer was then removed to the
hospital.
The operation consisted In making
an incision in the skin over the left
hip large enough to admit of the in
sertion of the seare4 palm. After
the palm had bÂ«en inserted In this
incision separate Incisions were
made for each of the fingers, into
which thÂ»\v were directed. To keep
the h&nd In place and allow the
skin to "take" upon the raw flesh
a cast was fitted about the suffer
er's body. Several times during the
operation the girl's condition was
very low. but she managed to pull
through the ordeal, and Is now re
covering rapidly. Â«

Good Flow at Roberts' Wells.
OAKLAND, - Oct. 29.â Members of . the
8eventh Ward Municipal -Water Works
League have inspected the two flowing
wells at Roberts Landing. San Lofenzo.
The approximate flow from both was 800 -
000 gallons each twenty-four hours, air
pressure increasing the quantity to 1,000 000
gallons. â¢ H. Pascoe. a member of the
league, said the water waa Â» flowing: from
a thirty-foot stratum of gravel near the
bottoms. of the wells. He suggested. that
the Board of Public Works make another
inspection - of the wells. Pascoe thought
water in abundance could be found on the
Roberts " DroBerty â¢
Exposition, where he tiaa been since the
latter part of June. Mr. Henshaw ex*
presses himself as being favorably Im
pressed with everything ne saw. He does
not Join In with others in sayln# that th*
fair does not compare with the.sreat Chi
cago exposition. The one striking dlffar
ence Is, he saya, that the Pari* fair covers
a larger area, making it difficult to get all
over It without taking a great deal of
time/ . . . - â¢ v
Mr. Henshaw says the attendance* haÂ»
be?en picking up nf late and that the
French Government will not lose any
thing on the venture. <
"While In Paris." said Mr. Henshaw. "I
mat the members of the California Com
mission. They were all working hard
and doing. as much as they could to ad
vertise the State. There was a grand re
ception at the headquarters on the Fourth
of July and another on Admission day.
From my observations while In the Ea*t-Â«

Directed by Congressman Metcalf and by
Kred M. Campbell as the local secretary*
it has accomplished rrhat no local cam
paign committee or club could.
Campaign literature of every possible
kind has been sent into every corner of
the State of California, and not in a dis
organized way, but under the most intel
ligent direction. Lists of names and ad
dresses were secured from prominent Re
publicans, members of countv commit
tees and candidates, and In each case tha
politics, occupation and descent of the
voter was asked and given. The kind of
literature that was most appropriate to
his case was then sent. Into the minlnyr
camps and lumber districts of California
great quantities of good Republican doc
uments that would interest those voters
were sent. Thousands upon thousands of
documents in the German language were
sent t<? Gertnan voters in all parts ot tha
State until there has not been a county
or a township in California that has not
heard from the Metcalf Bureau in Oak
land.
. All of this has been done by Congress
man Metcalf and Fred M. Campbell, with
the aid of volunteers from among the Re
publicans at Oakland. The following in

Works Hard for Success of
General Republican
Ticket.
METCALF LABORS
FOR HIS PARTY
McCutchen had Boardman in hand for
an hour trying to straighten out some of
the tangles of the aged witness' direct tes
timony. There was a great deal of data,
given which Boardman frankly admitted
was not testified to as a matter of his in*
dependent recollection. So ne had gathered
from his private records this information.
Some of it. ha also testified, had probably
been procured from. Anthony Chabot, who
had, said Boardman, been personally very
active and prominent in the construction
of the reservoirs, both at San Leandro
and at Temescal.
Mr. Hayne ascertained that a great
many Chinese were employed as laborers
on the construction of the San Leandro
dam. He wanted to know whether Board
man had not told the City Council in 185$
that the plant of the Contra Costa Water
Company could be reproduced for between
20 and 30 per cent less cosw&an It did
originally.
Boardman's memory was deficient, but
he admitted he would not contradict any
record that might exist upon that state
ment. The witness save the reason why
he had made the report of 1SS6 to the City
Council, that report having been used by
recent .Councils in finding a valuation of
the water company's plant.
Boardman said he had been requested
by the late A.Chabot to make that report
for his (Chabot's) use In connection with
the- reports which were prepared by En
gineer Le Cpnte for the city and Engineer
Schuyler for the water company.
From memoranda Boardman gave the
following figures upon the cost of labor
and -material during the construction of
the dam:
Daily wain, from 1.S6S to 1S73â Masons $7.
helper* M. common laborers S3. teamsters $3.
teams J6. From 1373 to 18S6 tne figures wera
the same, except for a reduction of 50 cents a
day in common laborer* and teamsters' wages.
Ccst of material â Sand, per cubic yard. $4;
brick, per thousand. $23; cement, per barrel. JT.
ground. The company's figures and those
of the city's experts do not come within,
three miles of agreeing.
Judge Hart gave the engineers a half
hour more, but they could not settle their
differences. Â»o the interrupted cross-exam
ination of Boardman was resumed.
Â¦ But there is still unsettled the question
of pipe lines*- owned by the company. The
engineers have compared notes and data,
but fall to reach a unanimous decision on
the number of miles of two-inch pipe that
the company owns. Approximately it ap
pears to have about eighty miles under-
The day s proceedings were tame. En
gineer Boardman was on the witness
stand nearly ail day. and was crcss-exam
ined at great length by Attorney Hayne.
Boardman's memory -was again given a
severe tÂ«st. and he found that' without
constant reference to his books and notes
he made little or no progress. Â¦ . . â¢
The water company opened the session
with an offer to have the rival sets of ex
pert engineers on both sidts confer con
cerning some agreement as to the quanti
ties of material and the manner of con
struction of the San Leandro and the Te
mescal reservoirs.

1118 Broadway. Oct. 29.
The Contra Costa Water Company has
been ordered to produce in court a lot of
its records which hitherto have not been
available for examination by the counsel
for the city. Whether the documents are
of value In the litigation is a question
which investigation of them must deter
mine. At any rate the insistence of At
torney Hayne has forced tne corporation
to produce something. The disclosure that
the. company had not burned all of Its
records; of construction, etc.. was made
during the trial this afternoon in the tes
timony of F. M. Hewson. the company's
engineer, who had been called to the wit
ness stand by Attorney McCutchen.
Hayne was watching the course' of the
inquiry upon the company's property,
when Hewson in reply to a question ad
mitted hi? had procured certain dnta from
books belonging to the water company.
That was enough for Hayne, ar.d the
city's representative made an Immediate
demand that these records, whatever they
may be, should be brought into court.
There was a skirmish, but Hayne held his
ground and won out in his demand. Judge
Hart ordered the company to produce
these records.

"OLD MEN FOR COUNSEL, YOUNG
MEN FOR WAR," THEIR MOTTO
Members- of the Unique Quarter-Century Club Are Making
Strong Fight for Success of the. Republican Ticket.
OAKLAND, Oct. 29.â "Old men for
counsel, young men for war.' 1
This is the motto that has been
adopted by the Quarter Century
Republican Club of Oakland, the
most unusual a,nd one of the most effec
tive campaign clubs in the , State. The
motto and the name are Indications of
the character and the aim of the club, and
there is not a member on the roll of 200
names that has not voted the Republican
ticket for a quarter of a century or more.
It Is the most sincere and earnest club in
the whole of this State, and there is noth
ing that partafces in the slightest of the
nature of a club for political office only.
Ail of the officers and members have dons
gallant service for the party that they
have so loyally represented for so many
years,' and many have served their coun
try as wellÂ« as their party in office.
The club was organized at the very be
ginning of the campaign as an organiza
tion that was going to work for tho inter
ests *of the entire ticket -and not for any
one nominee or party faction. It broke
this rule In the case of Congressman Vic
tor H. Metcalf only, and indorsed Mr.
Metcalf before the primary upon the
broad principle that it was. best" that a
Congressman should be retained in office
as long as possible. Since that, time the
members have done good work for the
party. They have kept their headquarters
open day and night, and have held weekly
meetings addressed by prominent men, in
the midst of a campaign' that was very
dull. It may be fairly said that the Quar
ter Century Republican -Club has done
more effective work in Its own quiet way
than any other organization "in the city.
The membership of .the club is taken
I from among the leaders of the party in
State as well as Oakland politics. Charles.
N. Fox. the president, has been Supreme
Justice of the State. Of . the vice presi
dents, N. W. Spaulding has . been the
United Btates Sub-Treasurer in San Fran
cisco and has been Mayor and Council
man of Oakland; J. M; Haven has always
been a leader In the firfit for good gov
ernment in Oakland; Giles H. Gray la a
pure politics leader and School Director of
Oakland; Harry N. Morse vm.9 the first
Sheriff of Alameda County: A. C. Henry,
ex-Mayor of Oakland; A. W. Bishop, tho
secretary, was president .of the- Oakland
City Council, and. Frank H. Brooks, the
treasurer, is cashier of the California
Bank of this city. . *
Most of these men are pioneers of the
State. Many came' in the days of '49 and
were Whigs before the Republican party
was organized. These are the real "Lin
coln Republicans," and not the brand that
is being talked about by the Democratic
orators. They have always been Republi
cans through long and useful lives, and
they have now united for the benefit of
the party of their choice, giving the ser
vice of their age as loyally as they gave
the service of their youth.. â¢
Nowhere else in the State does such an
organization exist, and nowhere can a

â¢ ? â
The Rev. Peter C. Torke delivered a
sermon in St. Peter's Catholic Church last
evening on the subject of "Immortality."
He made a strong and effective grouping
of the facts which have led thinking men
in* ancient" and modern times to have faith
In a future existence" for mankind. A
large audience listened attentively to the
able discourse. Many of the speaker's il
lustrations were plain, nut none the less
striking.
Father Torke Instanced coal In th.e
grates of the locomotive as an Instance of
the example of the diffusion of energy.
That energy had been stored up for many
years. Converted , by heat it produced
steam in the boilers, and the energy con
tinued its influence indefinitely. The rip
ples caused by casting a stone into the
water were also instanced. Whatever en
ergy was created never ceased, he "said.
Although it might not be detected by the
most exact and sensitive instruments, it
continued to be exerted. â¢ â¢
It was not reasonable, therefore, to sup
pose, said Father Torke, 'that the force
within man. which caused such - Â¦wonder
ful works, could ever be destroyed. They
were the outcome of energy that never
failed. All the works of God " proceeded
according t6 law. If it was true that the
forces of human nature were never de
stroyed, surely it was true that the more
powerful spiritual energy would not fall.
Mankind had. two great instinctsâ the de
sire to preserve the race and the desire of
preservation of the individual. So strong,
Â¦was the desire of preservation of the in
dividual , Implanted In the human mind
that suicide was commonly attributed to
mental derangement The desire to pre
serve the Individual, had undoubtedly been
placed In man for some good purpose.
What was life or existence if there was no
real pleasure in being?
The 'period of earthly existence was
brief, the speaker said. Man desired hap
piness. Poets said that no I matter what
the man had " in the world, he was not
contented. There was always a fly in the
ointment; always something lacking. If
God had given men the desire for happi
ness, and there was no real, lasting hap
piness ' in the present existence, there
must be some other place where happiness
would last.
Men had wrath against wrong. The
souls of men objected to 'Injustice. Men
passed from onÂ© sorrow to another In life.
In eternity God's justice would shine
forth.- In conclusion. Father Torke urged
his hearers to live righteously and well.

Peter's Listens to His
Address.

Albert M. Boyne. recently chosen first
lleutÂ«nant and inspector of rifle practice.
Fifth Infantry Regiment, has success
fully passed the examining board of the
Second Brigade.
The issuance of a commission to Cap
tain Wall of the First Infantry Is still In
abeyance, and it is said that the matter is
now in the hands of the commander in
chief. Mr. "Wall has been twice elected
in his company, once as first lieutenant
and subsequently as â¢ captain; but for
some unexplained reason neither com
mission has been issued to him. He has
passed the examining board In each case,
has. been, found to be fully qualified and
the members of his company have for sev
eral months been wondering Â¦why. he can
not obtain his commission. It has been
suggested that in view of the fact that
he has been elected captain and that
more than* sufficient time has elapsed to
either grant or deny him his commission
at the election for colonel of the resl
ment he present himself and offer- to vote"
on the ground that he Is the legally elect
ed .commander of his company and that
in the event of his right to vota being
questioned he file a protest as to the le
gality of the election. It Is thought that
in that way his standing in the company
and regiment will be fully determined. .
The following orders have been issued
for the inspection of the several organ
izations of the Second Brigade:
The First Infantry Regiment will report for
Inspection and muster in their armories at San
Francisco, as follows, viz.:
The Â¦ field, staff, non-commissioned staff offi

The Important topic In the First In
fantry Regiment of the National Guard
at this time Is the election which is to
be held for colonel of the reeTiraent to
night at the Page-street armory. A3 the
matter stands at this time Lieutenant
Colonel Thomas F. O'Neil has twenty of
the thirty-six possible votes pledged to
him, he having gained one since tha cau
cus held a few weeks ago. If all are
present to vote on the night. of election
his promotion is assured. His elevation
would create a vacancy in the office of
lieutenant colonel, which' would have to be
filled by election, and it is probable that if
O'Xeil is promoted Major Thomas Mc-
Creagh will be advanced. That will
create a vacancy in the position of major.
For that position there are two candidates
spoken ofâ Captain W. R. Robertson of
Company F and Captain T. J. Cunning
ham of Company 1C
At the election held in Company G last
week Lieutenant W. N. Sweasey was
elected captain, Walter S. Grattan first
and P. J. Neumann second lieutenant.

The Board of Education, the board
of examiners and the Superintendent of
Schools are at outs again, the point cf
difference being the power of the board
to renew a certificate without the recom
mendation of the board *of examiners:
also the power of the board of examiners
to refuse to deliver to the Board ot Ed
ucation for renewal a certificate demand
ed. The board of examiners is composed
of the deputy superintendents, and on tho
ruling of the superintendent that the cer
tificate of Miss Katherine Ball, superin
tendent of drawing in the department. Is
Illegal, the board of examiners has re
fused to recommend that it be renewed
or to deliver it to the Board of Education,
although by resolution the Board of Eu
ucatlon has already renewed it.
The certificate of Miss Ball will expire
to-morrow, and in accordance with cus
tom the applied some time ago to tho
board of examiners to have it recom
mended for renewal. The recommenda
tion was refused on-the ground that wh.^n
Â¦ he entered the department six years ago
â¢he did not enter with the credentials the
law demanded and that therefore her cer
tificate was illegal from the start and it
could rot be renewed. It was suggested
thai Miss Ball take an examination, but
this she declined to do and the matter
rested so far as the board of exaxnineits
was concerned. The case was brought to
the attention of the Board of Education
st its first meeting in October by ex-
Judge Sanderson. Wno appeared for Miss
Bali, and as there was no thought of
charfring incompetency, â¢ the question
reiFf-d being a strictly legal one. the
board considered the case and decided to
renew the certificate without the recom>
mondation of the board of examiners.
Then the cert ficate was sen^for in order
that the clerk of the Board of Education
might record upon it the renewal, out the
examining board has refused to give it
up and it still holds possession of the
document. The Superintendent claims that
he cannot sign a salary demand upon such
a certificate, issued without the recom
mendation of the board of examiners and
unless the matter be finally settled by a
favorable recommendation by the.exam
iners the case is likely to get into the
courts. . "
In the contention of the Superintendent,
however, there lies a point that' Involves
the certificates of more than" one of the
specral teachers in the department. He
holds that special teachers must have the
same credentials as are demanded for reg
ular teachers,, or they must pass the same
examinations. . . .
Under the law the only way for a "reg
ular teacher to enter the School Depart
ment is to be examined or to exhibit cre
dentials from certain universities desig
nated in the law. To enter as a special
teacher an examination or credentials, un
specified, are demanded. It is the claim
of the Superintendent that the credentials
must be the same in each case," but the
special teachers point to the. fact that In
the institutions deslgnated*in the law such
specialties as they teach had no place at
the times of their appointments, and to
apply the same rule to both classes" of
teachers would defeat the very purpose
for which the law was framed. It is
claimed further that if the credentials
submitted to former boards of examin
ers were found to be sufficient and were
passed. It is not now the time to raise
the point that they were insufficient.
There are ten or twelve special teachers
in the department, all holding certificates
under credentials passed by former boards
of examiners, but insufficient under the
present ruling of the Superintendent. The
office is making a test case of the matter
and should the Superintendent's ruling be
upheld all holders of these certificates
must be re-examined.

Drs. R. Addlson Huntington of 547 Fol
som street and J. D. Hill of 1116 Sutter
Btreet were yesterday arrested on com
plaint of Coroner Cole for causing the
death of Jennie McKown.' Both men were
locked up in the City Prison and will be
detained until after the Inquest. Coroner
Cole will then be asked to swear to com
plaints against them for murder. - 1
Huntlngton admitted to Captain of De
tectives Seymour last night that he was
well' acquainted with the unfortunate
young woman and had been keeping com
pany with her. - Â¦
Yesterday morning an autopsy was
performed on the body by ; Morgue
Surgeon Leland and the Coroner, and the
mosti convincing evidence was secured to
show that the dead girl was In a delicate
condition at the time the operation was
performed and that the physicians had
made a bungling job. The accused doctors
stated to Coroner Cole that Miss McKown
came to Dr. Huntington's office last Sat
urday evening, accompanied by her sis
ter, Mrs. Belle McCottrey of 2711>i Sutter
street, and stated that she was suffering
from a complaint requiring an operation,
and that they were not aware of the true
condition of the girl until they had started
in to operate. Â¦:Â¦ .
The autopsy report Is to the effect that
death was caused by "collapse, due to an
operation performed: contributing cause,
administration of chloroform."
Coroner Cole said yesterday that Drs.
Huntingdon and Hill had committed an
Impropriety in operating upon the young
woman in Dr. Hill's office. He said she'
should have been taken to a hospital or
sanitarium and there operated upon In the
presence of competent medical witnesses.
Such a procedure would have saved the
operators from the suspicion that ther
knew what ailed Miss McKown. â¢
Dr. Huntlngton graduated as a physi
cian last July, and he has not had much
experience in operations of a delicate na
ture.
' Miss McKown was a stenographer and
only 21 years old. Mrs. Mary Rhein. a sis
ter of hers, committed iuicido on May 8,
1899, by taking carbolic add while, tem
porarily demented by sickness. Â¦
Last evening Captain Seymour obtained
complete statements from the accused
doctors. Huntlngton, who Is a graduate
of the College of Physicians and Surgeons,
said that # Miss McKown had been under
his treatment for about a month. She
went to his office last Saturday afternoon.
She was accompanied by her slater, Mrs.
McCottery, who. left before the unfortu
nate, woman was placed under the influ
ence of chloroform. Dr. Hill 'administered
the anesthetic After the young woman
had become unconscious she was given
some strychnine hypodermlcally to resus
citate her. As she failed to show any
signs of life artificial respiration was re
sorted to, but to no ax-all. For three hours
Huntington andHlu worked over her. not
withstanding that the woman was dead.
Huntington admitted that he did not no
tify the Coroner, as he was Ignorant of
the law relative to such cases. He signed
the death certificate and had the body
sent to an undertaking establishment at
Twenty-flrst and Mission streets.
Under a severe cross-examination Hunt
ingdon admitted that he had been keeping
company with Miss McKown and was on
very friendly terms with her.
Dr. Hill's statement is as follows: t
â¢ "On Friday Dr. Huntinrton asked mo
to administer an anesthetic for him, and I
consented. I met him at his offlce at 1
o'clock on Saturday and proceeded to ad
minister the chloroform. During thÂ« op
eration the rlrl succumbed to the Influence
of the chloroform. I had nothing: to do
with the operation. It kept me busy ad
ministering: the anesthetic I never had
an accident before."
Captain Seymour will not charge the
men until after the Coroner's lncmest.

Carl Trefz, who conducts a saloon at
609 Montgomery street, was found uncon
scious In a basement of a house on Stock
ton street, between Clay and Washington,
early yesterday morning. He 'was re
moved - to the Receiving Hospital, where
it was found that his skull was fractured
After recovering consciousness Trefz
claimed that he had been attacked by two
men,. who. after knocking him senseless,
robbed him of $120. After the case was
reported to Captain Seymour he detailed
Detective Tom Gibson to make a thorough
Investigation. , Going to Trefz's house he
closely, questioned him, but lailed to get
any information from him except that^io
had been robbed. Trefz was unable to
describe his two assailants, but thought
that one .was tall and the other short.
During. his investigation Gibson learned
that -Trefz had left his saloon Sunday
evening and visited several "joints" on
Barbary Coast. When he started for his
home he was very drunk. He was sen
staggering along Stockton street, followed
by two Chinamen. The supposition is that
he fell Into the basement where he was>
â¢found and that he was i-ofebed by the
Chinamen who had followed him.
Â¦In order to get hia money the robbers
were forced to cut the pocket of Trefz'a
trousers. That Trefz, who weighs over
200 pounds, was not instantly killed seems
miraculous; as he fell a distance of about
fifteen feet.
MRS. LIZZIE TOMLINSON of
the '"King of the Opium Ring"
company, who attempted sui
cide by the gas route in her
dressing ro-im at the Alhambra
Theater on Sunday, has recovered from
her collapse and will probably be re
leased frcm the Receiving Hospital th!c
morning.
There Is no dcubt that the attempt to
end her life was the result of despondency
brought on by her misplaced love for a
member of the company. The woman
was evidently determined to make this,
her third attempt, a successful one. It
was learned tnat she. had swallowed a
large amount of coal oil just before she
turned on the deadly gas. *
At the hospital she told Steward Kahn
that she had tried hard to secure poiscn,
but was unable to buy any, and she
begged him to give her something to
hasten death. Manager Taylor said thut
Mrs. Tomlinson had been with his com
panies for five years.
"This is not her Iirst trial at suicide"
said he. "and I am through with her as
an actress. I will see that she does
not want for anything, but she cannot
work for me again."
Agnes Williams, the soubrette who
filled, tne part of Mrs. Tomlinson at the
performance last night, did so in a very
creditable manner, more so considering
that she had but a few hours in which
to study her role. . ;

After the horrible banalities'. of "Quo
Vadis" it is'apleasure to find the stage
of the Columbia Theater once more held
by a play that is strong without being
B coarse, emotional : without being senti
mental. Such a play is Augustus Thomas'
."Oliver Goldsmith," presented", last" night
by Stuart Robson and his excellent com
. pany. ' _> \s-?/;>- :Â¦ Â¦ ' ...
Mr. Thomas has ingeniously utilized for
his first act the mistaking by Goldsmith I
of a gentleman's house for an inn: -this,
of course, is the well-known incident upon
"â¢ which "She Stoops to Conquer" is found
ed. In the. Thomas play the incident 13
; .transferred from Goldsmith's youth to his"
; manhood and serves . as an easy â¢ lntro
i; auction to the second act, wherein we. are
. shown a rehearsal of "She Stoops to Con
j Quer on the stage of - Covent Garden
Â» 1 heater. This act is the best in the play
â¢ and contains more than one scene of dell
. clous comedy, the bÂ«st being that between
, Garrick (Mr. , Henshaw) and Katherine
. Jjorneck , (Miss Mortimer), although the
Coleman-Garrick discussion about the
Â¦ faults ' of "She Stoops to Conquer" is
1 scarcely less diverting. The serious ele
1 ment In this act is supplied by the love of
1 Goldsmith for Mary itorneck, which leads
; v" iÂ° knoc k down the villain, Kenrick,
Â¦ who has insulted her. The third act shows
j us Goldsmith in his garret; his arrest for
debt;, his deliverance through the gener
osity of Miss Horneck and his diffident
confession of his love for her. Thoroughly
. to enjoy the ending of the play, one must
forget or be ignorant of the career of the
real Goldsmith, which included neither
marrying nor giving In marriage.
Mr. Thomas' third actâ situation, char
acters and many speechesâ is lifted al
most bodily from Goldsmith's earliest
Play; "The Good Natured Man." It fits
very well into Mr. Thomas' play, and
there is no possible objection to its being
used, if its authorship Is acknowledged.
But I can find -no such acknowledgment
on the programme. Will Mr. Robson ex
plain? .
As to the rendition. Garrick was a
small man and Mr. Henshaw, who per
sonated him, is a very Jarge one. "Would
it not have been p0.3s.ible to nnd some
one who could look a.s well as act the
part? That Mr. Henshaw acted it ex
cellently cannot be denied and when. he
disguised himself in the trappings of
Twitch, the bailiff, he was superlatively
good. Mr. Weaver, as Dr. Johnson, and
Mr. Grattan.as Burke, met the require
ments of their parts admirably. Mr.
Robson. â well, j everybody j knows Mr.
Robson's style. His long and varied ex
perience on the stage makes it impossi
ble for him to do augnt but finished work
so far as the technique of his profession
is concerned. Whether he Is able to emo
tionalize you or not Is a matter of feeling
and not of reason. To me his .voice never
is and never can be pathetic. As to the
ladies,, one would have to go far afield
to. find.- anything truer and sweeter than
the act of Miss Mortimer and Miss White.
The play as a whole is clearly whole
some, entertaining and well presented. It
reflects credit upon both author and ac
tors; it is a play. which everybody should
see once and which many will want to
see more than once.

: ' .Tivoli. -
Another fine production of thÂ« opera
season at the Tivoli Opera-house is that
of "Alda," given this week with the new
"principals, Barbareschi and Castellano.
The soprano, has a clear and beautiful
voice, of rarely fine quality, and sings and
acts the name role in a grave and gracious
fashion and with much dramatic Intensity.
Her lower tones, less resonant and full
than the upper voice, were frequently lost
to hearing last night in the piano pas
sages through the careless predominance
of the accompaniment, which was notice
able, not only with her work, but more or
less throughout the entire evening. It
Was rather an off night with the orchestra
generally.
Salassa as Amonasro, of course, scored
a splendid successâ a little hoarse at iirst,
but his voice cleared quickly and he sang
the part of the dark-browed Ethiopian in
splendid fashion and looked it every inch.
The make-up of Barbareschi, by the way,
as the .slave girl, excellent as regards
consistency of integument, in costume
is irreverently reminiscent of Pocahonta*.
or even- of those Indian who
adorn, for some unknown reason, the
stores of the tobacconists. Â¦
Castellano is an excellent. Radames; his
brilliant,*. striking' voice- is here heard to
its best advantage. Lucenti as. Ramphls
and Schuster as the King fill acceptably
their parts and Poletini is a pleasing
Amneris. " '.

Through the efforts of Detective Ed
ward Gibson; Ng Ah . Poy, a noted ; Chi
nese murderer, is locked up in the. City
Prison. He .was captured last evening
as he was" leaving the Chinese V theater,
on Jackson street, but not without \ a
struggle. â¢'â¢..Â¦
.The specific crime for ; which. Poy Is
wanted Is for the killing of a fellow coun
tryman In the Chinese theater, â¢ on No
vember 14..1S98. His victim was enjoying
the show:, when jPoy, who was accompa
nied toy several other hired assassins,
crept up behjnd him and shot him in the
bacK. irÂ»oy escaped immediately after the
shooting- and went to Kresno, "where he
killed another Chinese. Since then he has
been traveling about the country murder
ing his fellow countrymen "just, for the
fun of the thing," as he expressed it.
1 Shortly after 9 o'clock last night Detec
tive Gibson, -who. is specially detailed -in
Chinatown, visited the Jackson-street
Theater In quest of the men who held up
the fantan game in the Globe Hotel the
other morning and. got away with a sack
of coin amounting to $1500. Poy "was in
the playhouse at the time and, seeing the
I detective, he "started, to get away. Gib
son at once recognized < him and shouted
to him to stop. Poy ran downstairs and
after passing: a revolver to a companion
darted up Jackson street, followed by.
Gibson. After a short chase the detective '
overtook him. ahd placed him under ar
rest. The murderer made a stout resist
ance, but was soon overpowered and
handcuffed: At the City Prison he was
formally charged with murder.
According to. the police Poy is also
wanted for murder In Sacramento, Ma
rysville, Chlco and Fresno.-'
In 1S91 he tried. to kill Lieutenant. of Po
lice Burke, since dead, and was charged !
with an assault with a deadly weapon.
He was acquitted after two trials, and to
celebrate the event he fired two shots at
a Chinese gambler with whom he had
had trouble. In 1892 he was arrested for
robbing a Chinese woman and- again es

Sherman, Clay & Co.'s
new rent
contract
plan for
selling
pianos
If you intend renting or "buying
a piano, investigate Sherman, : Clay
& Co.'s new plan. It is very dif-
ferent from the old .'installment
plan. Their new plan enables you
to purchase a fine high-grade piano
and make payments of only $6 a
month.
Why, think of it! Merely renting
a piano costs you nearly that much,-
and you never own the piano.
This new rent contract plan has
many other commending features
that are of advantage to you, so
suppose you call and investigate.
-NOTE. â Should you' desire to
exchange the piano purchased for
a Steinway, at any time within
three years, you will be allowed the
full purchase price.
