him. If I .to in the afternoon he lets nja

Jealous! Did you ever hear of an old
man who had a young wife who wasn't?
Jealous, yes. desperately so. I was crazy
to go to Honolulu this summer, but ha
couldn't bear to let me go so far away.
"Too much water: too many miles; too
many young men." he said. As If they
would be interested in an , old married
woman! No amount of flattery, coaxing
or any other old thing could budge him.
I am a busy woman. I practice, prac

and music lessons also on the violin.
Mamma attends to the house, so when I
am net at my music 'I am either visiting:

After that he never said a word. GavÂ«
me a $400 sealskin Jacket a few days later
for being nice to him. There is nothing
like knowing how to get around one's

dlstesand tailors In the hone of carry-Ing
off the blue 'ribbons. In the absence of
-H'ss Jennie- Blair,, who Is an enthusiastic
Doctor's Daughter.. most : of the work of
. getting: the dressmakers to display dolls
has fallen on Miss McEwen.
Â¦ The model dolls are all to be Judged be
fore -the doors, open for the public. The
wir.ner3.are selected by. the patronesses
of the affair. The ladles upon whom will
devoh'e the right of pinning on the blue
ribbons are: Airs. William Irwln. Mrs.
Clark Crocker, Mrs. William Fuller. Mrs.
Eleanor. Martin, Mrs. L. L. Baker, Mrs.
Henry Payot, Mrs. Henry Crocker and
Mrs. J. Downey Harvey.
There la to be a dollhouse such as never
before gladdened bright round childish
eyes. It Is a huge affair, on which car
penters and paper hangers have been
Â¦working many days. Not the usual "dry
goods box" dollhouse. but one with an
artistic exterior designed by a "really
truly" architect. The Inside of that house
. Is fine enough to suit,the most fastidious
doll that ever came over from Paris, and
to makÂ«* the owner the envy of all the
children these many miles around.
It is as complete in detail as a modern
brownstone with all the up-to-date mod
ern Improvements. There Is a miniature
telephone, so that dolly can know th*Â«
pleasure of saving- "hello" to her friends.
Electric buttons are there ready to pres*
at rny lady's pleasure. Tiny Incandescent
globes light up this doll mansion. ThÂ»>
bathroom Is a gem In shiny porcelain and
tiling- In fact the house has everything
from a chafing dish to a laundry. Mrs.
I. Stow Ballard, Mrs. John Flournoy and
Miss Louise Bruce have 'scoured the city
over for the furnishings of this doll pal
ace. From Europe and New York Miss
Jennie Blair ha3 sent on things to raaka
It a joy forever to the most exacting
younpr miss who ever gave peremptory
orders to Santa Claus.
For those who like- simple* Inexpensive
dollies there will be a tableful, presided
over by Mrs. Frank D. Bate3 and Mrs. E.
H. Horton. They are the kind of dolls
Â¦who do not flaunt any "touch-me-not"
signs. They aro made to be kissed, cod
dled and fussed over and are not even
above the dignity of a wholesome spank
ing."
This will probably be the last doll show
the Doctor's Daughters will give, so tha
ladies Intend to make It the red-letter one.

Dyke, giving to each day some passage
from that author's stories, essays, crlti- ,

and helpful. George Sidney 'Webster has
done his work most carefully and con
?.cientiously. lilt* little volume "The
Friendly Year" will make an excellent
companion, with Its lofty thought set
forth for each day of the coming year.
Mr. Webster 'says In his introduction:
"In making this little year-book of se
lections, the suggestion of which is entire
ly my own, I have not sought to illustrate
literary qualities so much as to bring
tkf" dominant note of human friendliness^
and comradeship, which runs through the
writings of an author who knows books.
well but who cares more for people."
Mr. Webster chooses for January 1 the
following little stanza, which It might ba
Â¦well for all to take to heart:
Four things a n:an must learn to do
If he would make his record true:
To think without confuaien clearly:
To love his fellow men sincerely:
- To set "from honest motives purely i

Atwood's Pictures
The too brief career of Francis Gilbert
Attwood has been carefully watched by
those interested In satirical and humorous
art, and his death at an early nge has left
a vacancy without a successor. Mr. Att
wood's best -work was done In recording
from month to month in dainty yet force
ful vignettes the most strikln- events of
contemporaneous! history." Tnls was done
without any idea of. their having any bur
a passing Interest. Gathered together,
however, they put in attractive form a
pictorial history of ten years of tho
w'orld's doings which Is most unique. Had
Mr. Attwood worked on a little broader
lines he might well have been considered
the John Leech of America. As it is, his
work, though less striking, possesses more
humor' and an equal appreciation of the
pictorial value of : passing events. The
present collection, "An Artist's History of
the Last Ten Years of the Nineteenth
Century," makes a luxurious book, taste
fully bound in cloth and gold. It is also
carefully printed on heavy paper. (Pub
lished by Life Publishing Company, New
York. Price $3.)
Poetry and Morals
A story, or verse containing an appro
priate and striking illustration of a moral
truth Is the pleasantest and surest me
dium for enforcing a character lesson.
Such an illustration arouses the attention,
stimulates the interest and causes convic
tion. In "Poetry and Morals." by Louis
Albert Banks. D. X>.. the author's skill In
stating and illustrating familiar truths In
an impressive and winning manner and
securing the animated. Interest of the read
er is strikingly; evidenced. The author has
arranged several hundred simple truths In
paragraphs appropriately headed in full
face type. The truths are explained in a
few terse sentences, and then verses, en
tire poems or prcse selections having di
rect bearing on thy truth are added, form
ing a perfect storehouse of suggestive ma
terial for the preacher and writer. (Pub

Christine Collbran, a young lady of six
teen, has written quite an Interesting ac
count of her trip to the Orient and around
the world. Miss Collbran sees everything
with the bright eyes of 'you' and has a
very happy and direct way of putting her
thoughts on paper. The book Is easy

Information served in such a way that It

A Squjrrel Calendar.
The Dodge Stationery Company of San
Francisco are to the fore this year with
something quite odd in the way of. a cal
endarâ something that will" make oÂ»r
Eastern cousins wonder. It is a calendar
in black and white with the cutest Htt!e
gray squirrel on one side that you ever
saw. The unique feature of the card is
that the squirrel has for its body and
tall the skin and tail of a one-time lively
California squirrel, which makes it look
as natural as life. Rather hard on the
squirrels, but artistically, it is certainly a
great success. They have also published
a very attractive little desk calendar
"California Rose Buds," which consists of
four soft brown card board leaves, each
one of which, has a hand painted water
color medallion on it. tn addition to the
calendar of the months stamped in whita
with a steel die. (Squirrel Calendar, Jl 25.

Bridge has already displaced poker and
whist, to a certain extent in the East, al
though to us of the West it is still rather
an unknown quantity. It is said that in
most select societydom of. New York somo
very pretty stakes pass hands In an even
ing's play, although R. F. Foster in his
recently published manual on the grama
tells us that "playing for high stakes, es
pecially if j they approach . too closely to
the limit that one can afford, will do more
to spoil a person's game than/ any thins
else, for no one can do himself justice
either/in his makes or in his play while
he 1b worrying about' the 'amount, he may
lot<e oh tho game." ' Mr. Foster accounts
for the taking: up of certain games and
making them the vogue by "something in
the development of the race, In the. condi
tion "of society or -in the state' of publio
morals,", and claims that "there Is proba
bly no game which so fittingly mirrors
the attitude of the American mind in the
conduct of busineas affairs as bridge."
In his present manual he gives a careful
description of , the game and the various
leads; to : be. considered. It's work seems
to be careful and thorough/ ' Mr. . Foster

It Favors a little of H&r.s Andersen's storv

human sentiment goes her hf-art never
quite gets the ice splinter out of it.
The "Singular Adventure of a Small

"The Mystery of Joseph Laquedem" com
pensates for it â a metaphysical story fol
lowinsr two lives from the death of Christ
to the present day. "Prisoners of War"
has a delicious touch of humor in it, with
a Mttle of the UsFon of the tortoise and
the hare. "The Lady of the Red Ad

love etory.
"Once Aboard the Lugger" tells of the

vi-ins the minister for her husband never

Our Motion's Need.
There are some books that defy a prop

JÂ«eed," by J. A. Conwell, Is one of them.
It deals with, economic, topics, but -it
treats them in a manner that is a* strange
mixture of a sermon: and a fairy tale.
The book is bo extravagant it is difficult
to treat it seriously, but- the tone is so
sincere it would be rudeness to make light
of it. Every page shows it to.be the earn
est thought of -â¢ an earnest man, and yet
Jt.is .difficult to read-it â¢ Â¦.'without > : smiling.
The nation's need, according to the au

of "divide up- and start even.''- ; He says
"a di\1de up and start even may be revo

should not be adopted." He. points out

Champion Horsewoman of America Is
Miss Belle Beach of New York
THE blue-ribbon equestrienne of
America is Miss Belle Beach of New
York. Perfectly fearless,, ehe and
her horse seem to have i a mutual
enderstanding that ehows off each to the
best advantage, whether she canters
through Central Park, bowls along the
fashionable drives of Newport, takes the
hurdles at Lenox or rides a spirited horse
In the ring of a metropolitan horse show.
Ehe knows the points of a horse as the
average woman does those of dress, and
her Judgment Is accepted as readily as
that of male experts in horseflesh.
Â¦When the horse show was on at Chi
cago this fall, Miss Beach's riding caused
the "Western folk to open their eyes with
astonishment. They know a thing or two
about riding, and they awarded the slen
der New York girl the palm over all other
contestants. Miss Beach captured three
blue ribbons In Chicagoâ one in the com
bination class for riding and driving,
where there were twenty-eight entries
and ehe the only woman; another In the
man's class, where there were fifteen en-'
tries, and she the only woman, and a
third In the ladies' class, where she com
peted with four other women.
She won the second prize In the class for
driving pairs, and, best of all. she took
the championship in riding on a horse ap
propriately named Exclusive..;-. â¢â¢â¢.'> .'.i
New York Is an older stcry of triumph

horse show, which ha* juet closed, Miss
Beach was, as *he has been for several^
seasons. One of the conspicuous features, j
won not only prizes but the applause
of the fashionable world that loves the:
l.orse and those v/ho are skillful and dex*
trous In the management of him.
In several instances Miss Beach has
had her mother for a competitor, and al
though Mrs. Beach Is a skillful horse
woman she has been vanquished more
than once by her daughter. The defeats
Â¦were tempered, however, by her pride In
l:er own work, for she trained her daugh
ter frcrn a chiid to love and to control
horses.
Miss Beach affects no mannish air*.
Her habit Is of the smart end modish kind
that society women wear, a long coat and
a. skirt thai reaches to the boot, when she
is on the horse, usually dark gray In col
or; high boots, a derby hat and a stock:
with a sporting pin thrust through the
Bcarf. She always wears a safety skirt,
ss that there Is nothing to catch In case
of an accident.

Such 13 Mutsuhlto (meek man), the ona
hundred and twenty-first of his line, tha
ruler of Japan- during the past thirty-two
years and the first absolute monarch vol
untarily to offer a constitution to his peoÂ»

work the eclishteced spirit of this gift.
Another instance shows something of
the same sort. To see the procession eza
the day of the Viscount's death thÂ» BnÂ»
sian Minister bad a platform built lervel
with the top of the wall In front of thÂ»
legation. A party of invited guests wero
there, looking down on the road alo&ff
which the Emperor and Empress were to
pass. "When the crowd saw this It mu>
mured, and then laid siege to the lega
tion, stoned the women and would bava
killed every one about the place had not
the timely arrival of military police saved
the Inmates. All this was because the
guests of the Russian Minister would have
looked down upon the Mikado. Position
signifies something In Japan.
The Mikado himself does not share this
idea at all. He is wonderfully free from
prejudices, and wishes his subjects to be
as enlightened as are the best of foreign
ers. There Is an entire absence of haught
iness in his demeanor. I have seen him
frequently at parades and at the races,
sometimes on foot and sometimes on
horseback, chatting with officers of thm
court. He has An agreeable oountenaBco,
with a nervous twitch In it at times, and
a pleasant smile. His eye Is bright and
has the slight slant that Indicate* higb
breeding In Japan, and he has nose enough
for eyeglasses !f he needed them, which la
a thing to be proud of In Japan. His beaxtS
and mustache are perfectly black, aa la
his abundant hair, and he carries hlmarit
with graceful erectness and dignity. Ha
wears a military uniform after the French,
pattern during his working hours. whJclx
take up much the better half of the day,
and seldom uses the native dress, exoept
when performing the Shinto ceremonies
before the Imperial cenotaphs In memoxr.
of his ancestors.
Viscount Mori, Minister of Education,
went to Nara to see the famous temple
there, which the caretakers tear down arnl
rebuild with new material every twenty
years. This razing and rebuilding has
gone on regularly for over twenty centtt
lies. The Imperial relics are thereâ e. mir
ror, a sword and a crystal sphere, and.
also a picture of Amaterassu, hanging be
hind a curtain. The Viscount had no great
reverence for these things, it seems. Xt
any rate he " entered the tempi* without
taking off his shoes, a serious breach oa
his part, and actually pushed aside with
his walking stick the curtain that con
cealed the goddess* picture. N>ws of thla
came to Tokio. and a young Government
clerk hearing it, and ascertaining by a
trip to Naru that it was true, sought out
the Minister and stabbed him in the abdo
men with a fish knife. (There Is mud*
Ignominy associated with a fish knife.)
It being a Jubilee day In honor of fho
Emperor's gift of a constitution to the
people, the court physician was away,
and so on down the line of his assistants
until, when a plain, ordinary doctor cams*
the Minister was past recovery.
News of the killing came to me on ths
west coast, sent without particulars. "VsÂ»
rlous explanations were about, all little)
more than guesses. One, however, is rufÂ»
gestlve. It throws light on the Japa
nese attitude toward the Mikado, it cam*
from a. member of the Board of Educa
tion of the province of Echlu. "I do not
know exactly the cause for It." he said,
"but I heard the killing was done because
Viscount Mori yawned In the presence of
our Emperor. I think that may be tfca
reason."
Even the Shogun, the Generalissimo
and the political head of Japan for centu
ries before 1SG3, was too important to be)
seen by. the pubUc: shutters -went up> at
his approach, and did any one peer discov
ery meant death. It was rather bewllJer

come out into the- light and show himself
real flesh and blood, though the natlvss be*
Uevethe flesh and blood to be of divine ori

The sun goddess, Amaterassu, mother of
Jlmmu Tenno. the first of the Jllkados,
has her sacred picture in many Japanese
temples. Xt will not do to look upoa
these pictures without proper ceremony,
as the following Incident illustrates:

and they bare seen much uf him.
With 8omÂ« two of his chamberlains
- and a military attendant, he has been
-. about the capital on all occasions of pub
lic Interest, and, . like other youngsters
of good birth, he went to 'the nobles'
school six days In the week. Here he be
â came the familiar friend of the best Jap
anese youth. I met him at the school
through the courtesy of one of the cham
berlains, Viscount Kadeyunokojl. of an
old Kugre family, and afterward saw him
frequently. Six of his chamberlains, In
cluding his maternal uncle, formed a con
versation class, which met at my home In
Kajlmachl three times a week. Mr. Cool-
Idge, a Harvard man, with whom I was
living, had great success In teaching them
the English language. They enjoyed the
conversations hugely, and part of â¢ their,
scheme for entertaining the Crown Prtnce
each day came to be telling him what
they had done at the house of the two for
eigners. To our delight, one day we made
Â¦ an exchange of photographs.
Like his august father, Haru-no-mlya Is
fond of. horses, and when the races are on
Â¦ at the beautiful course around the lotus
*pond in Ueno Park, one may surely find
him there. Even as a youngster In short
trousers he knew the horses and some
thing of the riders, too. He seemed to
take particular Interest In the horses
foreigners sometimes entered, and at
every opportunity would ask their own
ers about them. He had such a charm-
Ing nianntr, and such genuine eagerness
, to learn, that one would do anything
rather than disappoint him. Everything
that foreigner* used excited hla Interest.
A pocket slate of washable white cards
that had come to me as a present caught.
his fancy. He had never seen a white
"slate before, and It pleased 'him to have
one he could use over and over .again,
for he got It, of courseâ as It is quite
proper in Japan to pass along a gift. A
present sometimes, especially . at . New
Year's, may travel a complete circuit and
return to you again after faithful service
in providing Joys and opportunities.
: It ; Is his keen desire to acquire
knowledge, more particularly the knowl
edge that has given Western countries
their civilization, that has made a trip
abroad so desirable for the Crown Prince.
The Mikado's councilors had advised It
so soon as Haru-no-mlya should have
married and established ' himself. Last
May saw the nuptial ceremonies.
"With, the announcement that the heir
apparent has a son, plans for a tour of
the West will take effect. "
It would be difficult Indeed for a Euro
pean, to understand the way the Japanese
mind would contemplate a tour of the
world by the Mikado. Europeans are ac
customed to royal progresses, but no Ml*
kado Â«ver went abroad, unless we except
the female Allkatlo Jingo, who conquered
Korea'in the third century, according to
Japanese historians. Untll'recently even
the native Japanese could not see a Mi
kado. He reigned, but did not rule. In thÂ»
sacred palace in Kioto. Then the Sho
\ gun kept him shut up with the Kuge, or
court nobles. His Immediate attendants
\ were women. Ho was too holy to do any
' thing himself. The noble women would
1 not permit that. They clothed him dally In
silken robes (he must not wear the same
garments twice), they bathed him, they
kept him from the heat of the sun. the
chill of the wind and the evil Influence of
; the moon. His life was that of an Infant.
As soon as he had an heir the Shogun
put him into yet greater .retirement,
whatever that might be, and declared
there was a new Mikado. So, as genera
tions are of few years in Japan, there
were often several Mikados alive at once.

are eleven rooms in the house. Most of.
them are comparatively small; but the liv

pattern. The windows are tall and â¢wide.
In several rooms they are of French
style and open out upon broad verandas.
Hammocks, awnings, big porch chairs
and inviting recesses abound. The din

house. ; It is lighted on two sides and has
a huge brick chimney and mantel across'

pew character is a serious and absorbing
thing: for me. When I am once in sym
pathy with a dramatic character I can't
slight my work, for it will haunt me day
and night until I know that I feel my
part and have mastered all the details of
my character. I spent weeks In studying
the history of England and Scotland, and
in reading everything I could buy pÂ«r
Â£?ln>ns to the reigns of Queens Mary and
Elizabeth when I was making ready to
impersonate Mary Stuart. I spent weeks
n reading histories of the French Revo
lution, and especially of the events lead
ing up to that horrible revolt of an op
pressed people., when I was making ready
to play Marie Antoinette.

so much as ask leave to eat lunchoens*
from their baskets on our piazzas and In

ears Madame H Plena Modjeskaâ the
woman whom no !ess a dramatic critic
than Clement Scott has pronounced "thÂ«
foremost of her generation on the English
Epcaking ?tcgc. â¢ Â¦Â¦"â¢.
There is no heire in Southern California
to much askod about a? the unique ranch
home of Madame Modjeska. away back
among the Coast Range Mountains of
Orange County. Every winter hundreds
of Eastern tourists travel thirty and forty
zr.'.lt -p in wagons and carriage* across the
country purposely to- visit the famous
actress' home. In summer the ranch
home is always the scene of the most in
teresting and most bohemian jollities In
California. No home Â«n the Pacific Coast
has ever had among its guests so many
men and women distinguished the world
over for their genius and art. as Madame
Mcdjeska's little house in the mountains.
The late Fanny Davenport once said that
If she could spend a. few months each
summer in re.Â«t at a home like Madame
Modjeska's she might play juvenile parts
on the Ftage for a century.
Comparatively lew people know how
Madame Modjeskaâ or the Countess
Bezenta. as the is better known among
her old-time friends and neighbors in
Southern California â came to live in thU
State. Twenty-five years ago. wearying
of the stage in Poland and Russia, where
ehe had acted from her girlhood, she and
her literary hu>band, the Count Bozenta,
came with a colony of literary, musical
and artistic young men and women to live
on a co-operative ranch at Anaheim, in
the vicinity of Lcs Angeles. In two years
the colony broke up. It was a dead fail
ure from the first. Every one In it went
tack to Europe, disgusted with America
and denunciatory of California.
Count and Countess Bozenta were made
cf different stuff. They were charmed
â¢with Califorr.ii. and they found i^tÂ» fault
that their optimistic colony scheme had
failed. The Countess resolved to go upon
the American stage and retrieve her heavy
losses in the colony. Neither she nonher
husband spoke English then. By extraor
dinary work arid study almost day and
night f*Â»r ten ir.onths the Countess was
able to play in English the stage parts ehe
had formerly played in Polish and French.
She adopted* the name Madame Modjeska.
Her success was instantaneous. She has
never wavered in her fondness for Cali
fornia. The second year of her success
she had a Chicago architect (a friend of
her son Ralph) come out to the coast to
especially design an architectural gem of
a home for herself and husband among
the mountains overlooking the scene of
the -colony that the Count and she had
and planned for. â¢
. There was a deal of fun among the prac
tical, hard-headed ranchmen in the Santa
Ara Valley when they heard that the
Count and Countess Bozenta had bought
3000 acres away off among the God-for
eaken mountains, as they viewed them.
, and that they proposed building a fine
home there. Mountain scenery and the
reposefulr.ess of. canyons and valleys
exneng the mountain peaks had no c^iarm
for the ranchmen.
The Modjeska ranch is known by its
owners and their frifnds as the "Forest
of Arden." The name was chosen by the
actress in memory of her favorite dramat
ic character. Rosalind. The spot lies twen
ty-one miles from Santa Ana. twenty
eeven miles southwest from Pomona and
seventeen miles from the nearest railroad
station. El Toro.
The drive to the "Forest of Arden" Is
one of the most entrancing of the many
of that sort in Southern California. It
Is over a smooth and hard road in. some
places, and EXavelly in others. It leads
past thousands of acres of waving barley.
through thickly planted orchards : of
oranges and lemons, across great fields
of poppies, marguerites and blue-eyed
daisies, now in the shade of spreading live
oaks centuries old and towering eucalyp
itus. and out across ragged washes and
among tracts of shrubs, until the foothills
are reached. There the roadway suddenly
becomes picturesque and romantic. It is
about ten miles further on to Modjeska's
home : and the route is through Santiago
â¢ Canyon. A good part of the way is on
Â¦' the Count Bozenta's private estate, and
Â¦with skill and taste, that only ardent lov
ers of. nature possess, he iias created a
roadway- that is alluring at almost every
foot of the way. Only the sternest neces
sity and the most commendatory orders
of the engineers have caused any dis
turbance of the ways and works of nature
through the canyon. Wide detours have
been made to avoid the hewing down of
vigorous gnarled old monarch* of the for
est of live oaks, little rustic bridges have
been built to span the restless, noisy can
yon stream, while, to save excavation
.from the mountain sides, slant bowlders
coated with various hued lichens, have
remained untouched all along the way.
The road. winds slowly up the canyon to
CUT j-anch home.
Tor a mile the way Is canopied over by.
sycamores and tall, heavy, wild shrub
bery. Ju?t as they have grown there for
ages. Mossy banks are paseed at the
sides of the turbulent little stream, and
through the opening Jn the copse the un

violets ana golden eschscholtzlas. Up

the canyon overhanging boughs of mas

of wild herbs and flowers from the adja

and the fluty notes of flocks of meadow

The domain of the "Forest of Arden"
comprises about 2000 acres, but less than
seventy acreS has any cultivation
to speak of. The location was chosen
after much travel and sight-seeing, be
*Â¦ cause of it3 mountains, the great trees
and rocks and the rugged scenery on
. every hand. The grounds Â¦ about -trie
Â¦ house occupy two acres and about one
half of this is most beautifully orna
â¢\mented under the labor of the gardener
and the joint direction of Madame Mod
. jeska and the Count Bozenta- It took,
several summer seasons to create what
was desired. Scattered -about the wide
sweep of lawns are arbors of jasmine,
honeysuckle and ivy geranium, trellises
: of blossoming peas and English ivy. There
.â¢ are rustic seats and shady nooks by the
dozen under the trees and behind rocks
and beside, terraces. There are rocker
ies of wild flowers, fountains and little
pools, hotbeds, cactus beds and clumps
of tropical flowers galore. Palms by the
d<ozen and banana trees by the; half-dozen
rear themselves in tropical form from
daisies in the closely cropped lawns.
Orange and lemon trees grow here and
there about the ranch. Madame Mod
jeska has the true California love for
roses.- Over 100 distinct and different
varieties blossom about her home every
year. Rcscs are trained up the side of
animals. Xo one ever had moro Ccvr>t:=a
to dumb beast and fowl. When at homo
on a long summer vacation, after months
of theaters, hotels and railroads, Mm^
ModjesKa s greatest comfort is In her hen
yards, among her horses and -with her
prize cow. Every day she visits her hens
and chickens, watches with eager Interest
the development of each new Ivood of
chicks carries tempting sweetmeats to
her saddle ponies and call?, often several
times a day, upon her Jersey out in the
cow corral. Several residents of Sanu
Ar.a Valley tell of visits at the "Forest
of Arden at some time' in. the summer
season and of having seen the ravlshlngly
beautiful Juliet of their early theatrical
recollections metamorphosed into the do
mestic and rural Morljeska engaged 'n
throwing a panful of corn ear bv ear to
the big black swine at the rear of 'the
ranch. - .
"What do T do at my mountain home?"
said the famous actress to a reporter
some time ago. "Why, I do just what 1
like. The Count and I live as near to
nature as we can. For days at a time we
have all our meals served in the arbor:
we climb over the mountains, go horse
back riding, hunt for game, have visits
from our frieml3. and go down to Santa
Ana and Anaheim on short visits. I spend
some time every day in dramatic ptudy

that at the beginning of the- war 20: per
cent of the detailed men were out of ser
vice in two days. 'Â¦.'.' ' :Â¦.'Â¦"Â¦'
A great many preparations of food were
submitted to the board, but only three ra
tions were deemed worthy of practical
test. One was prepared by the board.
another by a compressed food company In
New Jersey and the third came from a
Western packing concern. A single ra
tion was expected to keep a man In good
condition for twenty-four hours. Bach of
the three rations was contained In an air
tight box. The, board's compound was
made up of two cakes of sweetened
chocolate and three cakes of a meat and
cereal compound. The Eastern company's
ration had a cake of sweetened tea leaves
and a cereal compound for making. soups
or a sort of Hamburger eteak. The West
ern ration had tea for a stimulant anfl
meat extract In Its food combinations.
Each ration' had a small quantity of .salt
and red pepper for seasoning. Â¦.
Emergency Batibhs Practically Tested
Twenty-five men of Troop A, Eighth
Cavalry, were sent Into the field to .make
the test.- They were to subsist, entirely
on the: emergency rations.: They were
sent away from Fort Renp-to~ FortjStiU/
making detours ' on the way. ' Morning
and evening of each ; day. the. men .'were
stripped, examined and welghe'd and their
pulse and, temperature were. taken at In
tervals during the day. . â¢
, The record thus secured was used by, the
board In determining how the rations af
fected the weight, health' and strength of
the men. At the end of the seventh day
the men reached Fort Still. Then the re
turn trip was made under the same condi
tions, only substituting another of the raÂ«
tions submitted. A third trip will â¢Â¦ nw
made to teat the last of the compounds-
' Tha board was naturally inclined. to re
gard Its own ration with- the greatest-in
terest. The -chocolate Â¦ weighed four
ounces- and the' meat , and cereal in com
bination ' respectively .four : and i eight
ounces, a total; weight of -sixteen ounces,
besides. three-quarters of. an ounce of salt
and : one grain of : red ! pepper. / : 'Â¦
The 'ration : was 'contained In a hermeti
cally: sealed can with; rounded edges, like
a flask,. 6% inches Ions \ by I$Â£x2 inches.
The can is opened wiith .a â¢ key. The ra
tion is. to be part 'or the permanent equip
ment of the soldier In the field. It can be
eaten in four-ways, dry, as a boup or por
ridge, or the porridgw may bet fried. '_-.
"The board's ration wia prepared under
our own personal supervision." said Cap-'
tain' Fountain In discussing ihe matter a
few days ago-. ' "Tho test will prove of
great value in the future for, army rec
ords. ;'. During the march the food . went

Â¦which -'- contain much nutrition, .but we
found that they 'caused disorders' of -the

Coffes Favorite Stimulant.
"There was considerable discussion in
choosing our stimulant; Eight out of ten
Americans .prefer coffee to tea or choco
late. Few Americans like tea. There
was an Insurmountable obstacle in the
way of our choosing coffee â namely, that
it loses its strength, when parched. The
board deceived a sugar-coated coffee pill
which was highly recommended. The
sugar was good, but *he coffee was' no
longer coffee. A cake of parched and
ground coffee, tightly compressed, came
from Germany, and was reasonably good,
but it took up too much space to* be used
with the Â¦ ration. In choosing sweetened
chocolate the board got '.a. serviceable
stimulant. ; Chocolate can be eaten like
candy, and fire and water are not needed
to prepare It for use. In addition to its
stimulating quality, which Is not tissue
building, chocolate contains cocoa butter

our ration has sufficient quantity and
quality and will' not nauseate when used

It is felt on every hand that now, while
the nation Is at peace, the time is ripe

Professor Atwater observed that If th3
men were as actively employed as If they
were in a regular campaign, engaged l.i
battle, more food, would be required than
If they were doins only routine work.
Then, too. the character of the Ingredients
of the concentrated ration was a very im
portant factor.
Another professor said he was of tha
opinion that a soldier would require more
than a pound of food a day (the estimated
weight of the r.ew emergency ration)/ no
matter how hlshly concentrated It was.
for there appears to be no food that would
furnish an adequate ration for a fighting
man that could be concentrated Into bj
small a compass.
Many persons not connected with tha
army are interested tu this test of con
centrated food. Professor W. O. Atwater.
the expert food analyst of Wesleyan Uni
versity, said to the Herald representative
that the Government experiment was in
teresting beyor.d question, but- he made
the same j-f mark that other well qualified
critics made, namely, thet the men who
were subjected to the test were under
no nervous strain, ns men In actual war
fare would be. and their physical condi
tion was likely to be materially modified
In consequence.

he sees fit to make, said while in New

is adopted its use will be made available

gress decided that such proceedings car
ried democratic simplicity too far, and a
commission was appointed to determine a
feasible plan for extending the building.
The report of this commission is now
ready and will be submitted, with draw
ings, to the Committee on Public Build
ings as soon as Congress convenes.
The plan agreed upon by the commis
sion 1 , with some slight modifications in
regard ' to -detail. Is that which is known
as '.'Mrs. Harrison's plan." This was the
first Mrs. Harrison, who. besides being an
admirable housekeeper, was an artist of
no. little ability. She was much averse to
the idea of turning the old house, dignified
with such . rich historical associations,
over to the business of tho executive.
Her husband but voiced her sentiments
when he declared that "notwithstanding
the numerous drawbacks and discomfit
ures of living in the White House in its
prescr-t condition, T do not believe there
Is a may or any presidential family, past,
present or future, who would not cheer
fully encounter many little inconveniences
rather than reside beyond the atmos
phero of historical events and associations
which cluster so thickly around this old
house, beautiful In Its simplicity."
Mrs. Harrison's plan involves the con
struction of an east and a west v/lnR of
steel and white marble, the west wins to
..contain tho. family rooms and perhaps
some rooms Â¦' for official functions." The
east wins will provide additional quarters
for the ever Increasing staff of clerks and
secretaries, and also a* larpe state din
ing-room, caivable of seating a hundred
guests. Tho largest dining-room in the
White House at present will hold no moro
than fifty persons, and of late years all
the state" dinners' have -been laid in the
large main corridor on the first floon This
apartment la long: and narrow, and after
its extreme capacity' of seventy-six guests
has been tested there remains barely room
for the waiters to squeeze between the
backs of thf! chairs and the wall. Many
an elaborate coiffure has been demolished
during a state dinner at. the Executive
Mansion of one of the richest .nations In
the world. , '
Similarly there is no. drawing-room in
the hou:-:o worthy of our President's use.
The really beautiful blue parlor Is well
enough for small, formal occasions. In
this room the President receives newly ar
rived Embapsadors, diplomats and other
foreign visitors. It will not hold a large
company. Fifty people would be a tight
.fit. In the blue parlor, it will be remem
bered. Grover Cleveland married Miss
Folsom. It was into this room that Presi
dent Oarfield was carried when he 'was
brought homo after the attack of the as
sassin urion him.
The preen parlor, Importantly called the
music room, probably because it is filled
to the doors with a grand piano, is such
an uglv. crowded apartment thftt no. one
could ever choose. to sit down in it. The
red parlor is the room most used as. a
drawing-room by â¢ the Presidential fami
lies. In the early seventies, and even the
early eighties, we would have deemed this
a very elegant apartment indeed. Nnwn.

-_^p Dr. Shrady's Opinion.
Dr. George F. Shrady said:
"My experience has been that men want
to get rid of their regular ration as soon
as they can. An army travels on i's
stomach. From the time of Alexander thÂ«
vital Importance of a good commissariat
has been recognized. Napoleon used to m
spect personally his army kitchens and
unexpectedly taste the food supplied Tm:|
Idea of supplying a certain amount of tha
chemical constituents necessary to nour
ish a man is all very well, but when you
put fats, proteids and the rest Into test
tubes It's aulte a different matter from
satisfying the material man. Certain vivi
fying processes axe absent.
"It la a curious thing that when an in
dividual ardently craves a certain edlblÂ«
his whole digestive apparatus is so stim
ulated that he can manage it much better
than at any other time. Wo have teeth
a Delate. Jaw muscles and other pieces
of machinery that are Ignored, if not In
sulted, when you pop a tao.ei into a
man s. mouth and say: There, you've had
your dinner.'
"There's work for all the body to do La
.maintaining the level of nourishment.
Stop using a muscle or a- limb and It
atrophies and becomes useless. We do not
want to become toothless and \ix\*
through neglect.
,"T n i r . e is one thln 5 t^at ought to ba In
duced in that ration and that's tobacco.
Seventy-five per rent of the men in tha
â¢ army would appreciate that. I've seen
em trade anything they possessed for
tobacco. They will tear their shirts off
and stick them on a bayonet, walk right
toward the enemy's trenches and beg or ...
barter for tobacco.
"It's a wonderful stimulant for worn
out, drooping men. It's a sedative, too.
Men in the tropics must smoke almost
constantly. Deprive them of tobacco and
you enervate them. Mind, I am not ad
vocating tobacco for everybody or every
thing, but .as part of an emergency ratios
for our army boys."
â¢ Major Brainard on Tobacco.
â¢Major Brair.ard. who Is at the head of
the local commissary cepartrncnt of the
army, echoed these Sentiments. He satd
he had seen a man trade a gold watch for
a small quantity of tobacco. He saict
while he was in charge of the commissary
depot at -Manila- he did not m?.ke requisi
tions for much of the pea and bean fiour
allowed in the ration list, because ho
knew It would soon spoil. J4Â»ce an.l other
carbohydrates Were substituted with sat
isfactiop. Colcnel Woodruff, or the com
missary department, is another man who
strongly recommends tobacco aa a. part
of the" emergency ration.
At a couple of the big dealers ixx

dirt. Their own- diseases ought to
convince them, but they don't. The rest
of their diet is simple and' meager. For
the most part 'they are vegetarians. They
eat rice, peas, curry and ghee, a special

professing vegetarians do - not exclude

they are in a hospital and are forced to
do so. To hard "workers in the cane fields

when to this sort of food is added the
luxuries of dirt eating; it is no wonder

in the old church of St. Martin'? in the

and finished years after by Mlllals as Nell
Gwyn on horseback. The history of this
painting and the favor with which it was
received by the publio was an evidence
of Nell's popularity and an assurance that
no noble EenBibllltles would be hurt by the
public reproduction of the story of her'
life. That sufficient time had elapsed to
dim the brightness of the "bar sinister"

owed its line to the peculiar relations
which existed between the comedy actress
of Drury Lane Theater and England's gay'

universally admitted to be a failure- and
rarely attempted them. Jler fortÂ« was
comedy, and she took part in very m*ny
Plays.
Tradition states that It was In the epi
logue of Dryden's "Tyrannic LowT* that
she first captivated the roving fancies of
King Charles, so that he went t>Â«hind thÂ«
curtain after the performance and car
ried her off.
Her last appearance on the stag* was
when she epoke the prologue to Dryden's
"Almanzar and Almahlde." or "Conquest
of Granada." when she wore a straw hat
as big aj a cartwheel and made a tremen
dous hit. The audience went into convul
sions and the very actors giggled, a cir
cumstance which was never observed be

The postponement of this play. In thÂ»
spring of 1670, until she was abl* to ap

In this year," 1670, she moved to Pall
Mallâ the Army and Navy Club now occu
pies the siteâ and the next year moved
over to the opposite or south side, where
her garden adjoined that of the King.

As fate would have it, during Mistress

v/ast engaging. the attention of Miss Brun
nen on the' very subject of the bad wo
mah'a mission. i
Zella had made up her mmd to relin
quish Mr. Dexter's employment.. Mr."
Dexter had made .up his mind to make a
tinal throw for her.
He had been carefully groomed for the
occasion. His gray hair â all that was left
of it â was -faultlessly brushed, showing a
tuft where his bit of whisker began and
ended. His face shone, despite tne pow
der the barber had used upon his "clean
shave." He wore a white waistcoat, a
green tie, a single diamond In his' shirt, a
orown fro.ckcoat and trousers, and a
tiow.er in his buttonhole. His face was
pale, and his Iip3 seemed more compressed
than usual, the und,er-llp slightly, protrud
ing. A. keen, fierce, expression gleamed In
ins eyes, that were bright and watchful.
Ihero was a great falling off from the
man he was when first we made his ao-
QU 5 lnt 5 nce - A" the bluft In his manner
and the self-confidence were gone. He
was, nevertheless, not so unprepossessing
as Mrs. O'Hagan made out; and for tlrta
special occasion he had tuned hls : voice
. into an almost pleasant key.

"Not a bit of it. I know your fighting

stant thoughts and attention of a man of
my position and wealth, and that with the
most honorable motives â marriage and a
princely settlement. Nay, listen. It Is
probably the last time I shall speak to
you on this subject."

"But you shall!" he replied, hurrying
to. the door, and locking it,

came to Parksfde while Zella was out.
Also it was between meals, and Mistress
O'Hagnn was alche in her little parlor.

Thpre : was a cold snap in the air.
Many of the leaves of .the bedraggled
avenues of Parkside were blown about
the roadways by the cutting wind.
It was not unnatural, therefore, for a
lady, to be wrapped In furs, though to
Mistress O'Hagan It did seem unnecessary
that she should wear beneath her sables
brocaded *llkÂ» and satins and jewels pa
lore,- and "rings on her nrr^ers that big
they dazzled. yer eyes to look upon thim.
and scents that powerful Pnrkside would
smell av thlm. spite av all she could do to
dust thim out." ,
From the midst of this glory of chin
ing attire there peered a wistful face,
ruddy with rouge. It was a young face,
too. and had been beautiful, with a cer
tain refinement about the mouth. The

By which . time Dexter had subsided,
his head leaning upon his hands, his bo'dy
half way across the table.

When a ship is homeward bound, and
making a rapid passage, it Is said that
the "girls have got hold of the towirope,
and are hauling her- home hand over
hand." To "keep the land aboard" is to
sail within .sight of It. A reQuest to
"Lend us your pound" conveys, not &
desire for a loan, but an appeal for'ad
ditional assistance in man weight when
hauling on ropes. To paint a thing par
tially Is to give It "a lick and a promise.".
In cleaning brasa work on board ship
two men usually wqrk together, and
keep their rags, and other material In ona
box. When they quarrelâ as Jack occa
sionally doesâ and a. separation ensue*.
they are said to '"part brass rags." for
at such times each man takes and keeps
his own "articles for ; polishing. âLondon
Express, . -
In hoisting a boat to the davits the
crew '"marry- the falls," viz. -.Join both
ropes together. .To be "keel-hauled" is
for a man to be dragged from one side of
the ship, to the other" beneath the ship's
i keel. This, like Vwalklng the plank." and
thence overboard. Is a custom .that ob
tained at the beginning of the century.
Keel-hauling has been aptly described as
"undergoing a great hardship."
If a man receives a month's advance oÂ£
wages- before Joining his ship," he Is said
to be "working off the dead horse" dur
ing his first month at sea. This period
Is" not infrequently referred to as "a
month, of. Sundays," to convey- the im
pres:Â«on that the. time- seems inordinately
long. â¢ . . â¢
After a more than ordinary hearty meal
Jack will "let out a reef In his belt
and exclaim that he is "chock-a-block."
* When the watch are called of a morn-
Ing they are- expected to "show a â¢ leg,**
as an indication that they hear the sum
mons and are about to "turn out."/
member of the crew is not unfrequently
called a "swab." Not to like the "cut of
his Jib" Is another term of disapproval.
To "toe"* the line" or "toe pttch" Is to
keep straight. â¢ , ' \ â¢
When Jack wants a rest he says ha
will take a "spell." it may be on d-clc or
belo-w. : - . " Â¦'â¢.'.. â¢
A man who is pale must not feel hurt
If he. Is told that ha has "a face like a
scrubbed hammock," while an unpopular
amples. When a person meets with
a rebuff Jack exclaims that he has receiv
ed "a slap over the bows," or that "he
has been brought up with a round turn."
To-be pulled up suddenly for any offenso
Is to be "brought up standing." To ba
"plankejl" is to be charged on the quar
ter deck before one of the ship's officers.
'Â¦ A .talkative man Is described as one
who Is always "chawing his own fat,"
When a man is hopelessly drunk he is
?aÂ»- to have his "back teeth awash."
Semi-drunkenness is described as bein?
"three sheets in the wind," or "half seas
over." A man of strange manners la
suspected of having a "kink" Is his
mind. Acute hunger Is likened to one's
"belly flapping against one's backbone."
"When Jack resorts to personalities hÂ»
doca not believe in half measures. A
stupid person Is called the "two ends and
the bight of a fool." For the non-nautl
â¢cal reader! It may be mentioned that the
"bljjhf'.of a rope includes that part be
tween thÂ« two ends. To be ",'kegged" is
to be ieered at. A "kldd" fellow" la one
who is natty In appearance.

THE "handy man" has a ready wit
and a perfect genius for Inventing
slang terms. Here are a few ex-
Siang Peculiar io
Jack Jar.
Two brides came to NomÂ© and the hust
ling hotel proprietor had cards issued for
another ball. It was a stormy night. . Ask
some one who has seen a Bering storm
and he will tell you what that means.
But the brides wero pretty, the music
good and nobody cared how the elements "
quarreled, as on all such occasions tha .
bottle pile In the back yard grew apace.
It was a little aialamut puppy that
nearly upset the equilibrium of the guests.
â¢ It took exception to a foulard gown and
proceeded to test th? foulard's holding
qualities, catching on? of many rttfilea
as thÂ«* wearer whirled by htm and bring
ing the wearer to a sudden standstill.
Th* lady coajced, the puppy growled and
took a. deeper hold. The lady decided thÂ«
dog was mad and her escort promptly
kicked him across s the room, when to
averse himself puppy promptly buried
his sharp t?eth in the nearest man's lee.
The man howled, bo did every one elsa
through sympathy. In the excitement of
getting the bitten one to the nearest
drug store where were add and todofonn.
puppy wandered out of the door Into th*
street, disgusted, and wondering why a
respectable Malamut dog cannot attend
a ball without getting mixed up In a
rough house.
Of dinners in Nome ther* Is no end.
Each newcomer of any Importance la
others' eyes Is made the excuse for a
dlnccr. The Cafe de Paris haa been tha
scene cf many a jolly party. At one of
these were mining experts and their
wives; army officers whose uniforms gavÂ»
color; Russian and Frsnch counts, whose
foreign manners and speech, not to men
tion titles, added to tha Interest â a' cos
mopolitan table full and one in which
there was never a dull moment.^-
Army hospitality la far-famed, nor does
It fall short of reputation within thÂ» Arc
tic circle. Both at thd barracks and tha
pest have been given dinners, dances and
card parties.
It isn't the lavlshneas of the entertain
ing cr of the entertainments that makes
the social life in Nome charming, It's the
whole-souled. here-to~have-a - gDod - tlma
spirit In which the people enter Into It.
A host offers the besic he" can, guests
make the best of what is offered. Compe
tition does not enter Into social affairs:
Mrs. Smith does not feel required to
give a euchre prize double the value of
Mrs. Robinson's. Some people's money
ccmea In driblets; some In panfuls: but
the spirit of hospitality 13 the same, wher
ever It Is found.

foir the rnanufacture apfl erection .of this
tnotuTteir- machine. It,! was brought ' here
in sections, and :the greatest care was ex-.
liapMcH in.roasscmbling the various sec
tions of steel so that the poise, of the
broad platform should be exact. :.
Jlundreds of. visitor* have trod ncross
this platform without knowing they were;
near one cf the most Interesting inechant- ;

They are not mentioned. In; the guide
bookx. and the men at the navy yard do:
not call attention to the scales, par excel-;
lence, unless perhaps a flat car happens:
to be on the platform being weighed with
Its load of two or three great guns. All:
the large ordnance manufactured for the
navy is weighed upon this machine.. It;
was built for that special purpose and haa:
givon eminent satisfaction, two years ol
usage having 1 failed to dull its sensitive 1
nature: â 't it lias done its work each day:
in a dull, ponderous way, with no meed :
of praise except from a few naval officers.
In order to Illustrate the accuracy of
the counterpoise cf the huge machine to
a reporter, an officer in the bureau of
yards and docks picked up a half /brick
which was lying near by and tossed It
upon the platform of the big scales. He
th*n consulted a long brass lever in thÂ«
reading box along the edge of the plat
form and found that the weight of the
brickbat was Just one pound.! . :
Turning to the reporter he said the
machine is bo sensitive, that it will give
the exact weight cf anything from a^
vqund of feathers to. a pair of thlrteen
inoi gun5, and do It accurately. Tha ca
pacity of the scales is 150 tons, or double
the capacity of the old set, removed .when
!the present apparatus was installed. A
thlrtecn-inch gun weighs -about flfty-fivo
tons. Two of these monster Instruments
of war. reclining on a forty-efght-foot car
truck, can be weighed on the machine
without taxing its capacity. . _'.

The most striking quality possessed by
"No. 7." according to shipbuilders, Is that
'she can operate at will In fresh wata*
as well as in salt. This no other Â»ub-"
.snarlne has ever been able to do. She can
pass from the ocean Into a river, and diva .
freely in either. And, what is considered
- even more Â¦ remarkable, she can opÂ«ra.ta
.. with equal freedom at the point wher*
. the .fresh and salt water mingle. This
â¢ property is due to a new arrangement of
water ballast that enables her to over*
'come the difficulties presented In diving
where the specific gravity of wate!
as it does from ocean to river*
or the reverse. The value of this prop
erty In war is not hard to appreciate,
, It g'ves the new boat a much, larger field
of operation In such harbors as New"
Tork. where tha Hudson becomes fresa
. a few miles up from Manhattan Islanfi, .
The Holland was severely handicapped by
the lack of this ability, and her failure ta
meet the approval of the board of Inâ :
spectlon at a trial on April 20. 1SS3, was ;.
largely r.scribcd to the absence of tha
fresh and salt water r.avlgating qualities.
Throughout th!s article the new beat

To the . lay mind *uch' a journey will
stein to sjnack docidedly of foolhardi
riess*. To the minds. of. the men wh<j are
to travel jn the submarine the proposed
Journey ranks with a trip on the Kaiser:
Wilhelny or the Deutschland. ..They ad
mit they will go slower,' but that is all.
The. voyage to Lisbon is to take sixteen
day.. "No. \~" will travel all the way under
her "own power. Her speed will -be ap
proximately nine and a half knots for the
entire voyage. She will not travel at
the bo'ttom of the pea as did Verne's fan
tastic craft Most of the way she will
go on the j surface. Occasionally, how
ever, she' will go under, ; and remain for
thirty or forty miles.. at a depth varying
from thirty to sixty feet. Her inventor
claims for her that she can safely go 400
feet beneath the surface and maintain
/herself there, resisting successfully the'
tci rifle pressure of the water. No such
depths wlll.be attempted on ; this trlp,
however, and except "for purposes oif scl
, enfiflc investigation or explorations ; for
sunken vessels no object would 5 be gained
by dhing very deep. At thirty feet be
neath the surface the craft is as -secure
against discovery as if she were a hun
dred times . as far down, . and can pass
safely beneath the keel of the , greatest
of ocean liners. Now and then In shallow

-waves, only her turret showins;. This .'will i
add very 'much to the comfort ofiher'crew.
Should it prove desirable she: may dive
; into the absolutely, still-- waters below the
legion , of. wave disturbances.!
Mr. Holland has the utmost confidence
in the ability of "No. 7" to make the trip
to Europe in safety. lie himself/ will be
in command. Including the inventor there
vviir be eight men aboard the little craft.
Their quarters will f be pretty : close, but
they feel certain that they will" not be too
cloee for comfort. Whenever -the "possi
bility has been discussed of navigating a
submarine - for a long distance it has al
ways I been asserted " that it would be Im
possible for a . crew to stand the confine
ment. The voyage to Lisbon is expected
to deter mine this matter. As the ; prbject
c-d trip is a first experiment an extra crew
will be. carried in a tender that is to con
voy "No. 7" to guarantee the men against
actual hardship. â This tender will be a
small tramp ship. She will keep her' lit
tle consort constantly, in sight Jf possible,
so long , as ' j the Jatter ' remains * on surface.

to demonstrate in- the first place, the fa 1-

not sustain themselves far away* from a
base of operation; that they are useless
as offer.sKt: weapons against a country on
t"he other "side of the sea, and that their
mission, ff they have any at all, is , for
coast defense merely. The second object
of the trip is to prese-nt the. boat in for

Mr. Holland's success as a builder of
submarine craft has not come without
long years of apparently fruitless en
deavor Twenty- five years ago he sub
mitted to the Navy Department plans for
a submarine torpedo boat to be operated
by one man. Secretary of the Navy
Robeson referred the matter to the naval
officer In command at Newport in 1875,
who reported that a vessel of. that type
was impracticable; first, because It would
not be possible to get any man to operata
It; and. second, because It could not bÂ«
directed under the water. The plan for
that one-man boat, which* seemed to tha
naval men of that time an impracticable,
dream, was the prototype of the sub
marine No. T,; in which Mr. Holland will
soon sail for Europe. Â¦Â¥Â¦ BPH
The six boats building for tho Govern
ment are patterned exactly on tha lines
of No. 7. Four are to bo constructed at
Nixon's shipyards and two at tha Union
Iron "Works In San Franci3co. The2Â»ara
to cost $173,000 each. Tho Holland Com
pany has sub-contracted for their con
struction and It Is one of the peculiarities
of the transaction that at this time no ona
knows exactly what their building is go
ing to cost. The profits of Mr. Holland
and his associates in the deal cannot bo
measured until at least two of the craft
are finished. It may be $30,000 that they
make on each beat or it may be only $10.
000 oc even less. . The experience of
building the other boat furnishes no
guide in the matter, as heretofore there
has been much experimental work. It Is
only now that the experiments may bÂ«
said to have been completed.
The boat has been very quietly built by
the Holland Company. Few persons out-*
side of those Immediately concerned witbl
her building have known that she -was goÂ»
Ins forward on the stocks of the Eliza*
bethport shipyard. Th 1 3 secrecy was prac
ticed because it was not known what ac
tion the Government might want to taka
with regard to her. . It was thought that
the United States might want to control
the building: of all ships under the Holland
patents and In that case it was desirabla
that the details of the construction o2
"No. 7" should not become publlo prop
erty- before her launching:. The Govern
ment, however, decided recently that
.nothing was to be gained by controlling
the designs, as foreign patents on all tha
details have been received by the Inventor.
Necessarily the papers on which the pat
ents were Issued by foreign countrie3
gave a complete description of every new
device employed in "No. 7." "When tills
fact was made plain the United States
Government contented Itself with order
ins six of the new boats. I The necessity
for secrecy Is therefore now dona away
with. *
before the long Journey is begun. IX ihÂ«
proves as satisfactory and seaworthy a4
her builders expect the final preparation*
will be made as soon as foul weathe?
comes. Mr. Holland says It vriH pleaaa
him br If ho can cast loose In the teetli
of a ruling storm, lie has such absolute
confidence In the* little craft that he tÂ«
pager to Jump Into the most difficult con
ditions at the very outset. The start will
be made from the Holland Company's
yards, in Bayonne. .:Â¦.â¢.

How truly pathetic was the meeting of
the Queen and her Canadian soldiers
seems to have escaped the papers.. Sitting
in a carriage the- Queen Intently watched
the men as they marched by within a
few feet of her and she commenced her
speech in brave tones. It was.onlya few
words, but before it was finished' tears
rolled down her Majesty V face, and her
voice broke and at the end it was almost
a sob. It is not astonishing, therefore,
that when Colonel Otter replied it was ta
trembling tones, and not one of the mea
whom he led into nearly fifty engage
ments felt ashamed of the grizzled colonel
because his cheek waa wet with tears.
Although deeply affected the Queen ap
peared to be enjoying her usual health.
The reason why only three companies
of the Canadians came back to England
is that shortly before the end of the year
for which the Canadians had volunteered.
had expired Colonel Otter communicated
with Lord Roberts, notifying him of th*
fact. The commander in chief said -hÂ«
would much like the regiment to remain
longer and asked Colonel Otter to sound
the men. The colonel asked the officer*,
who, without consulting the men. enthu
siastically guaranteed that their com
panies would remain. When the man
heard this they took umbrage at not be*
tng consulted ' and informed the author
ities that they wished to return in tne
stipulated time. Lord Roberts wrote a
letter practically begging them to stay a
little longer, but the regiment being split
up In various parts of the country and
the decision having been made they voted
to go direct to Canada, with the exception
of A and B companies. I Company, be
ing composed of regulars, was obliged to
remain, and A. and B were stationed at
headquarters. As a reward for staying
in. South Africa Lord Roberts enabled A,
B and I companies to participate In thÂ«
Pretoria celebrations and then sent them
home by way of England only a month,
later than, their comrades. The disinte
gration of thÂ« regiment at such a period
caused the keenest regrets and heart
burnings.

Germany, impressed by the combination

to modify her demands for the punish
ment of the guilty Chinese officials, Blnce
she does not yet know what the different
powers want.
"Germany, above all," the official said,
'wants harmony of action. Germany
foresaw that the nGte formulated by the
Peking Ministers would. not be accepted
entirely by all .the powers. "We have to
admit that several of the powers, Includ
ing Russia, desire a change in several or
the provisions. The whole matter is stir
Involved in great uncertainty, so that it
is Impossible to predict what form the
final agreement will take."
The Chinese Minister here said:
â¢This cannot be a question of the execu
tion of Prince Tuan or General Tung
Fuah Sang, who are still, de facto, in con
trol of the court. They both keep the
Emperor and Empress virtually prisoners.
The court is unable to go to Peking
even If inclined to do so. Resides the long
Journey from Slanfu to Peking, now thai
the snow i3 on the ground, is almost im
possible with the vehicles in Use in those
primitive districts. Starving outthe court
is .not feasible. The allies will be unable
to carry out such a measure. . However
even if It were possible, "the provinces
would rise in a body for the court's de
fense. The worst feature Is that the court
has lost confidence In Li Hung Chang and
Prince Ching, who have demonstrated
their impotence to* deal properly with the

Death of Colonel Yorck.
PEKING, Dec. 1.â Count von Yorck.
who commanded a German column of one
hundred men, which had been operating
in theVicinlty of Kalgan, three nights ago
slept in a room in which was a Chinese
stove burning charcoal. He was asphyx
iated and when discovered was very 111.
He died yesterday. German troops will
escort his remains to Peking. Colonel von
Yorck had distinguished himself during
the Kalgan expedition by forcing his way
to a difficult pa6S held by over G00 Boxers.

PEKING, Dec. 1.â LI Hung Chang has

has -agreed either to behead or otherwise
kill Tu Hsien, formerly Governor of Shen-
Pi. who personally. killed many Christians.
Members of Li Hung Chang's staff say
the Emperor will probably aend Yu Hsien
a silk cord, which is an intimation that
he must hang himself.
PARIS, Dec. 1.â Paul Kruger left
Paris this afternoon, and the
journey through Northern France
was attended by scenes similar to
those witnessed at Marseilles and
Paris. At nearly every station passed
crowds had gathered, which waved hats
and handkerchiefs and cheered the train.
The first stop was at St. Quentln at 3:40
p. m. The municipal authorities, many
spectators and members of the Chtmber
of Deputies j and various delegations
awaited the arrival of the train, which
was greeted with cries for Kruger and the
lioers. Mr. Kruger and Dr. Leyds ap
peared at the door of the carriage an-1
saluted and received the authorities. I At
Erquilinnes an enormous assemblage
filled the station and greeted the traveler
with enthusiastic acclamation. The pres
ident of the local Boer committee read a
long address, expressing sympathy with
the Boers and hoping that the war would
be terminated through arbitration . by the
RignerB of The Hngue convention.;.
At Jeaumont the, Paris Boer committee
bade farewell to Mr. Kruger, who replied
at some length, referring to .the warmth
of the welcome he had received and the
strength of feeling: exhibited in favor of
the ' cause he was urging. He said he
hoped the new cry which he heard aa he
waa departing from Paris, that of "Vive
arbitration," would become the cry of
Kurope. He declared he would not stop
his work until the. hour the African re
publics had regained their independence.
It was a cruel war, which in the in
terests of humanity Bhould be ended. The
hearty cheers of France. Mr. Kruger said,
wa-i forever engraved upon his heart, and
he thanked Pans and France for the man
ner in which they had received him.
At Charleroi, the tlrst stop on Belgian
territory, rigorous police measures had
been taken to prevent the invasion of the
station, but the people rushed on the plat
form and gave vent to their feelings in
cries favorable to the Boers. The train
stopped for five minutes and Mr. Kruger
greeted the mass from the stet>s of the
car. At Namur a similar scene was en
acted. . . Â¦
At Jumont Mr. Kruger said that when
he landed in France he spoke of the bar
barity with which the war had been con
ducted, adding that before he left France
he wished to say that he had made Lord
Roberts acquainted with these wrongs
and that the British commander had
promised that the cruelties should cease;
but whether he had not been obeyed, or
whatever the reason, the barbarities con
tinued. Mr. Kruger felt it his duty to
explain that he had complained as the
chief of staff and not as the head of his
family, for his own family had been

In this city to-night. Physicians are try*
Ing hard to save her life, but there Is lit*
tie hope for her recovery. The cause for
the act Is unknown. The young lady haa
several brothers here and has been Keep
ing house for them.
She is only 21 and she is the central figure
in an international romance of love, mar
riage and elopement. As for the stern
parent there was none. The Cincinnati
man of millions took his titled daughter
to his heart in a warm embrace. He had
an equally cordial hand grasp for thi*
young man of 23, who. In Ions fur-llned
coat and Sootch golf cap, stood beside his
bride.
The Cincinnati girl who came home the
heroine of a romance and bearer of one
of England's proudest titles, looked
charming. Slight, but well formed, with
a wealth of glossy blonde hair and a man
ner as democratic as her words promised,
she made a pretty picture in the half-light
of the ship lamps. She wore a stylish cos
tume of black, with a collar of white lace
about her shoulders. As she stepped out
into the cool night air she had donned a
long black automobile coat trimmed with
sable. A hat of black velvet with ostrich
plumes set off . to advantage her fine
blonde hair, which Is almost too light to
be 'called golden. The Duke was dressed
in a rough-and-r^ady blue flannel outing
suit with trousers correctly turned up.
Over this he wore a long rur-llned over
coat with deep astrakhan collar and cuffs.
The Duke and Duchess brought twenty
seven pieces of. baggage. There was a
great crowd at the pier to meet their.,
Including an army of detectives, who ha Mi
been employed by Mr. Zimmerman. Tha^
latter had received two anonymous com
munications. An unknown writer had re
buked the millionaire for permittmg his
daughter to marry a titled foreigner when
there were- "so many poor Americans Â¦who
were more worthy."
"You need not be surprised," concluded
the writer, "If upon their arrival herÂ« tha
Duke and Duchess are rotten-egged." Tha
Duke and Duchess were not molested ami
the party drove to the Holland House.
They expect to remain there a week or

lin says that Mr. Kruger has been- ad
vised that Count von Bulow, the imperial
Chancellor, will only exchange â¢ formal
visits with him; that public demonstra
tions will be suppressed, and that the pro
posed municipal banquets will be aban
doned. While' there is much sympathy
and curiosity to see- Mr. Kruger, there is
no chance of such a furore as occurred at
Marseilles and' Paris.'- -. â¢
The enthusiasm in the Belgian towns
through which Mr. Kruger passed
rivaled that shown In the towns of
France.' A\ Logoe a crowd numbering
2000 persons thronged the platforms and
the approaches to the station. Among
this gathering were a number of deputa
tions with banners, and the Logoe pro-
Boer committee, the president of which
read an eloquent address expressing sym
pathy with the Boer cause and promising
Mr. Kruger as. magnificent reception in
Belgium, if he should stay there, as had
been given him in France. * The crowd at
the station was tumultuously demonstra
tive. -Its members sang the Boer hymn
while awaiting the arrival of the train,
and when the latter was signaled the peo
ple swamped- tha barriers and> rushed
upon the. platforms.. Gendarmes with
fixed; bayonets tried to force them back,
but the crowds swept the officers aside
and massed around Mr. Kruger's saloon
car, raising deafening shouts of "Vive
Kruger!" "Vive les Boers!" and "Vive
arbitration!'/! Mr. Kruger spoke a few
words of thanks.. â;. Â« Â¦ t Â¦Â¦ . .. _Â¦ â¢
As the train fstartlng cries Iwere
heard of <"d0wn' with, -the English,"
whereupon the curtains of the saloon car
were quickly drawn,:- though., before the
train left the station Mr. Kruger reap
peared at the window and waved his hand.
A group of students marched from" the
station to the British Consulate followed
by a small crowd, shouting "Down with
the English, "Down with Chamberlain."
These cries were redoubled .when the Con
sul, with his family, appeared on the bai
cony, but on their withdrawal the demon
strators dispersed.'.
Mr. Kruger was much fatigued with his
journey â¢ and bandages were frequently
applied to his head.
COLOGNE, Dec 1.â Mr. Kruger arrived
here at 11:30 o'clock. A great crowd had
assembled and caused a dangerous crush.
No official reception had been arranged
and Mr. Kruger drove to the Cathedral
Hotel, the crowd cheering as he left the
station and as he drove along the route.
The absence of an official welcome is said
to have been due to neerlect to secure an
understanding with the Â¦ imperial court,
wliich is necessary- in case of visits of the
heads of States., hence it is reported that
Mr. Kruger will probably po to Berlin at
once.
treated with the greatest regard by Lo:
Roberts and he thanked him for this.

- SEATTLE^ I>oc, 1.'â The telephone ' line
men of Seattle have been on strike for two
weeks.' It Is said' that the grievances first
started here have ; since become the basis
for the strikes* in. other cities where the

as not more than twenty-five men are af

In addition to employes of electrical
companies in San Francisco who went out
on strike a number of workmen Jn. Sacra
mento and Fresno struck, j There is a dif
ference In the totals of men out on strike
and remaining at work, according to the
sources from -which the figures are de
rived. A. Clark, superintendent of the
Auxiliary Fire Alarm, said yesterday that
lus company had been asked by employes
to give an eight-hour schedule and had
agreed to do so. K. C. Jones, chief engi
neer of the San Francisco Gas and Elec
tric Company, Â«aid that concessions ~ had
been offered to the men, who had Insisted
upon' recognition of the Linemen's Union.
Then! was no friction attendant ' upon
the Btrike yesterday. Many men remained
at work. Last night President Keefe and
others connected with .the Linemen's
Union held a conference at 73 Fourth
street and talked matters over at some
length. Mr. Keefe said that the men were
confident that they would win.
John I. Sabln, -president of -the Pacific
Telephone and Telegraph Company, made
the following statement;
"But very few. of my men have left me;
so few, In fact, that the" strike will not
bother the company locally in the least.
I reaffirm what I have often saidâ that I
om ready to meet my men oa individuals
at any time, but I cannot consent to dic
tation from a union. 1 The men may belong
to forty unions if theychoose. ; I have no
objection â¢ to that, . but , they must/ when
dealing .with, me,- come , as individuals." .
A strike of linemen who have beÂ«n em
ployed by the electrical companies took
place yesterday morning. The movement
â¢was' under the direction of the executive
board of the Linemen's Union, which con
sists of David Keefe, A. C. Johnson, V.
Bentley, J. W. Burge and F. P. Noonan.
The purpose of the strike was explained
by David Keefe, president of the "execu
tive board, to be to force from the em
ploying companies recognition . of * the
union, to obtain shorter hours and to get
certain rates for overtime and holidays.
Secretary J. W. Burge made the same
general statement and declared that the
union ought to bo recognized. A meeting
was held at 102 O'Farrell Btreet. af which
the general subject was discussed before
any action was taken.

bat successfully the disease, notwith
standing the fact that long attention Â¦ to

and vitality. Lieutenant Hobson is on a
six months' leave of absence on account
of trouble he had with his eyes and his

a room in the Army and Navy Club. Fri
day evening he felt much Improved and
for several hours devoted himself to his
correspondence, which had fallen behind.
Suddenly he grew dizzy and,, calling^ an
attendant, was helped to his room and
r>r. Bellamy was sent for. The physician
â¢was quick to realize the serious condition
of his patient, with whom he remained
throughout the night..
This morning thera was no improvement
and Dr. Bellamy decided that It would be
better to have L/ieutenant Hobson at once
removed to a hospital, where he can have
constant attention. The removal was
made this afternoon. . Later a' blood test
was made and the nature of the disease
was fully established. Dr. Bellamy said
to-night that under â¢ ordinary, circum
stances he would have little fear that his
patient would not recover. Owing to. the
fact that he has been ill for several weeks
the present attack may be of a very seri
ous ynature. Â¦ -â¢Â¦- â¢

NEW YORK, Dec. L-Flfty delegates,
representing 100,000 Roman Catholics, de
cided at a meeting just adjourned to form
a federation of Roman Catholics in the
United States. Preliminary steps toward
organization were taken at a' secret meet-
Ing held at the Fifth Avenue Hotel.
Among the societies represented at the
meeting were the Knights of St. John,
Catholic Benevolent Legion, Ancient Or
der of Hibernians, Irish Catholic Benevo
lent Union, League of German Societies
of Pennsylvania. Catholic Mutual Benefit
Association, Catholic Total Abstinence
Union of America, Catholic Young Men's
National Union, Catholic German State
Union of New York, and General Benevo
lent Association. The meeting lasted for
four hours. At its close It was announced
that a committee of ten, of which Thomas
P. UcKenna of Long Branch, N. J., was
chairman, bad been appointed to draft
plans of the proposed reaeration and re
port to a convention to be held at Cincin
nati on May 7, 1901. A committee on or
ganisation, with Congressman John J.
Fitzgerald of Brooklyn as chairman, was
chosen. " ..
It was emphatically denied by one of the
delegates that the federation was being
formed for political purposes, or that the
influence of the organization would be
used to gain more civic power. . It was
admitted that this matter had come up
during debate, but the delegates unani
mously agreed to keep the organization
out ot politics. It was also denied that
the question of Roman Catholics being
unjustly discriminated against was dis
cussed at the meeting. A project looking
toward such a federation has for some
time commanaed the attention of Cath
olics. It has been suggested that if men
of the Catholic faith could be brought un
der one national head they would have
strong Influence in national legislation.
Catholics have charged that there is dis
crimination against members of their
church and it was announced that It was
this alleged discrimination that- they In
tended to combat.
Speaking of the proposed federation re
cently. Father F. H. Wall said to a Call
representative: "There is no doubt that
Catholics are discriminated against, al
though they simply demand their rights
under the constitution. Take, for ex
ample, the Indian school question. This
Government entered Into a solemn cove
nant with the authorities to the effect
that if a church established, built and
equipped schools and furnished teachers,
the Government would maintain them.
This agreement has not been lived up to
by the Untied States. Then take the loot
ing of Catholic â¢ churches in- the Philip
pines by the American troops. Some of
the sacred relics from churches are now
exhibited In store windows on Fulton
street In this city.
"One of the most unjust edicts erer pro
mulgated was that of General "Wood, Gov
ernor General of Cuba, refusing to recog
nize a marriage solemnized by the rites
of the Catholic church, performed by a
priest of that church, and declaring that
none but a civil marriage contract would
be valid. Such an edict was iniquitous in
the extreme and clearly showed discrim
ination."

demonstrated her powers as what she has
just accomplished for J. IV. Watklns of

Mr. and Mrs. Watklns came to Califor-

thing that gladdened their hearts more
than all the beauties of our glorious State,
Twelve years ago Mr. Watklns' oldest
I son. a boy of fourteen, suddenly left their
Jiomc, a farm near Bucyrus. and was
never heard ., from afterward. Having
heard much of Ismar and her wonderful
powers he went to see her for advice.
Among many other things she told him
ttat be would find his long lost son work-
teg in a certain restaurant in Los Angeles,
io firmly did Ismar impress him with the
. truth of her statement that be accord-
frgiT left for Los Angreles. where he found
IiIb son Just as she said he would. He la
loud in bis praise of Isroar*s powers.
, This is only one of the many Instances
Jn which Ismar has united the separated

The Pope begs, of all Christians to do
what they can to know their Redeemer
tx* he is, and he especially appeals to the
clergy to exert their zeal for this purpose
as far as possible in the pulpit and schools
ond wherever opportunity offers.
These, the Pope says, must be sought ;
absolutely from the church, and accord- '
ingly, as Christ is the way. for men, so
also is the church. He of himself ana by
his nature,' she by the 'office conferred on:
her and communication of power. There
fore, contends the Pope, whosoever looks
for salvation outside of the church has
gone astray and is laboring In vain. The
case, he says, is almost the same with
states as with individuals. They, too,
must end disastrously if they depart from
the way. The Pope next declares that by
confusion of ideas both rulers and sub
jects have been led away from the true
paths, for they needed what was want
ingâa. guide and support.. And, he asks,
do we not every day see states which have
labored hard to Insure an Increased pub
lic prosperity distressed and suffering in
many- respects,- and these of highest im
portance? "True, it is asserted that civil
society suffices for itself; that it can get
on well, though -without the aid of Chris
tian institutions, and attain its end by Its
own efforts alone. Hence it is nought to
laicise work- of public administration, so
that the traces of ancient religion are
dallv becoming fewer in civil affairs and
public life. But, the Pope says, those who
are responcible for this do not perceive
well enough the effect of what they are
doing. Â¦ , .
For the idea of Judging what is good
and what is evil being given up, laws must
lose their chief authority and justice col
lapse: In like manner, says the Pope,
when hope and expectation of eternal
happiness have disappeared there is a
disposition to thirst eagerly for earthly
goods, and every one endeavors, by all
means in his power, to grab aa much of
thorn as he can for himself. Hence arise
jealousy, rivalry, envy, hatred and then
horrible schemes; a desire to abolish all
power; a design to create ruin every
where; no tranquillity abroad; no security
at. home. Christ, the Lord, must be re
tlored to human society as to his pdsses
n'.on. |BPWS|9B|HKyte>BlB8i "
ing forth, developed Into a great fire, and
that the excellent example set by many
pilgrims might move the rest of the
â¢world.
The Pope asserts that if they recognized
that nothing could be more wretchea than
to have left the Redeemer of. the world
and abandoned Christian customs and
teachings, surely all would arise and,
changing their course, seek to escape cer
tain ruin. To preserve and extend the
kingdom of God on earth Is the office of

POPE LEO'S ON THE
END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
MEW YORK, Dec. 1.â The vexed
question of Idssinsrfon thff stage
has been broiiRht barik into
prominence by the amended com
plaint in *the suit brought by
Katherlnc Grey against Richard Mans
fleld. Miss Grey was a Mi.-s Best of San
Francisco before she took to the stage.
She is now the wife of Actor "Jack Ma
son, with whom she filled an engagement
some months ago at the Orpheum In her
native <?ity. ,
The complaint brought by the actress Is
unusual : in the fact that Miss Grey does
not so greatly object to the kiss itself, re
garding such osculation as an exigency or
the part In which she was playing, but
she objects strenuously to Richard Mans
field's-manner in performing the act. v
The amount of her objection is placed
at $1500. the damage, being asked for the
reason that the plaintiff '-became serious
ly 111 and shocked so, that she required
medical aid and attendance." The amend
ed complaint also contains some strictures
on the eminent actor himself, which ven
ture into. the}. realm- of- .-..expletive Â¦â¢_ .
Miss Grey v also alleges that Mansfield
insulted her by coming into the > stage
box when she was before the footlights,
and by mocking her caused her to be
come nervous, an attack of nervous pros
come-"up for trial shortly. â¢ â¢
Bernhardt and Coquelin.
â¢ The first performance of Mme. Bern
â¢hardt- and^ M. Coquelin at the Garaen
Theater lave the public its first opportu
nity of seeing these great artists together
in "IVAiKlon." It was a wonderful per
foWam-e. . As the Due de Relchstadt. the
son ot ' Napoleon, Mme. Bernhardt played
on all the emodons f with a master hand.
In the white costume of an Austrian of
ficer her figure, still girlish and graceful,
evoked expressions of surprise^ and ad
miration. In the scene where Prince Met
ternich points out to the Due. as reflected
in the glass, the Austrian traits of his
countenance, which Napoleon's son affects
to despise. Mme. Bernhardt achieved -a
great triumph. In the battle scene In the
fourth act, where L'AJglon on the field ol
Wagram sees An a dream the whole ca
reer of his father, and the voices of the
dead seem to acclaim the Emperor from
the tomb, the tableau was full of gran
deur. In the death scene in the last act,
where the consumptive Due dies in a fit
of coughing, the great French actress
gives a remarkable bit of acting.
A representative of The Call was grant
ed an interview with Mme. Bernhardt at
her apartments in the Savoy. â¢ Her greet
ing was most cordial. A long, lank, black,
figure, taperins toward the feet: skirts
wrauped closely around in. a swirl; the
skirt a train oi lace, with bottom of fur,
crushed about the feet She peered at me
with an encouraging smile from beneath
her mop ot hair.
"Oh, ves! San Franceesco. I remembei
Â¦well. Three times thlr. will make, and I
lalk that ceety very mooch, I tell you; in-
dee3. very mooch. Perhaps It ees because
they laik me too. I shall be there in Feb
ruary and shall play in 'I/Alglon,' 'Ham
let' and possibly 'Camille.' "

The rains have started many stamps.
The snow is accumulating in the moun
tains to keep them going. The storm of
m. fortcigrht ago gave Bodie three inches of
Enow. In some places on the main street
cf that town the banks were six to seven
feet high. The Bodie Miner-Index says
that the storm was the heaviest of any in
eeveral years. The "weather sharps" in
the mountain towns are predicting a se
vere winter in the high altitudes. Accord
ing to the Calaveras County papers the
rains have insured a. fine season and war
rant a hope that the gold output of the
county will exceed that of any previous
recent year. The stamps, the giants, the
sluice box. the pan and the rocker are in
motion, and the -rolden harvest will soon,

lhe Calaveras Miners' Association has
re-elected W. C. Ralston as president, Da
vid McClure Jr. vice president, A. I. Me- !
Sorley secretary and C. M. Whitlock I
treasurer. The secretary was authorized '
to have a number of postal cards printed j
soliciting the miners throughout the coun- j
ty to join the association; also to have a
circular printed, to be posted in the va
rious postoffices in the county, urging
upon the miners of the county the neces
sity of maintaining the county organiza
tion and of joining the same.
The Southwest Miners' Association has

CALIFORNIAITS IN WASHINGTON
PARIS has been amazed to find a sudden boom in her matrimonial market. The marriage
rate in that city is never high, and consequently when the municipal register recorded 60
marriages in the first week of October the sociologists ofthe city began to search out ex^
planations of the phenomenon. . '
From reports that come to us it appears to be the prevailing belief that the exposition is
the main cause of the increase. It is argued that the big show has.put a good deal of money into
circulation and.thus enabled a good many more people ,to set .up: housekeeping than would other
wise have been the .case. Furthermore the artistic exhibits of household decorations on every sort
of scale, from those designed for palaces to those for flats or workmen's cottages/have tempted
a good many comfort-rloving persons to get married just for the sake of havine a home to
decorate. : . -
" / . If these, views ofthe subject be confirmed by further investigation', and if the (increase in
the;, marriage; rate continues; for the remainder of the fall,; we may expect Boston .to start an ex
position next year. The matrimonial mafket^in that town 'has been low for along time and the
people are sufficiently. enterprising to take advantage, of the lesson taught by the experience of
Pans. Â¦ 'Â¦ â¢Â¦ "'",""'/"'Â¦". ; .; '.. , 'â¢' v-----: ; -Â¦Â¦-Â¦Â¦.
EXPOSITIONS AND MARRIAGES.
Transportation at such rates constitutes one' of the marvels of the century. It explains the
rapid growth of the Middle West and reveals something of the handicap on the Pacific Coast, and
particularly on California, where the Southern Pacific" continues to levy all the traffic will -bear
Fortunately we have now prospects of, better things, arid we may hope to see at a not distant date
our transcontinental roads duplicating tosome extent the wonders achieved in the East.
EASTERN farmers have long been' complaining of the competition of the West/ and it ap
pears they have in many instances good reasons to sustain them. Railway transportation
between the States of the Middle West and the Atlantic seaboard 'has now brought the
farms of Minnesota and Iowa, and even the Dakotas, commercially nearer to New York City
than are the farms of the" adjoining counties.
At the recent annual dinner of the New York Chamber of Commerce President Cowen of
the Baltimore and Ohio Railway stated that it now costs less to bring wheat, the equivalent of a
barrel of flour, from a point 500 miles west of the Mississippi River to Minnesota, to have, it
ground there and converted into flour, and then to transport the barrel of flour thus made to the
city of New York, than it costs to bake the. flour and distribute it to the bread consumers of New
York after it has arrived in that city. '

RAIN IX SOLANO COUNTYâ A. 8.,
Vallejd. Cal. In order to obtain the rain
fall of Soiajio County tor the season 1&3Â»
1300 it would be necessary to have data
from every part of the county, and as that
Is not obtainable the figures asked for
cannot be given. The rainfall at Elmlra,
in that county, during that period was
1S.C6 inches.
A THIRD TERM-Subscriber, . City.
There is no law that eays a man shall
not serve three successive ?ermt a.% Pres
ident of the United States. There is an
unwritten law, however, un'Jer which no
man has ever been nominated for the
third consecutive term. Washington de
clined a nomination for a third term and
since then it has been ttre will of tha peo I
pie that no man should be greater than
\\ ashingrton as a ruler of the nation.
PRECIPITATION-D. A. C, City. The
reason that the precipitation or rainfall
Is much less in the southern part of tho
fatate of California than in the northern
is because that portion- is farther away
from the storm centers. The precipitation
In Portland and Astoria is greater than in
bputhern Oregon, because they are nearer
the storm center and nearer the ocean.

A MARVEL IN TRANSPORTATION;
GHRISTMAS is coming, and already. the st6res have begun to show their bright array- of
Christmas goods. The shopping season for those who intend ;to ; gifts to relatives or
friends in the East is at hand. It is therefore timely to. recall [S^AfiiFdrhia'ris ; 'tha : t-Jit-:s^"
lecting gifts for such purposes preference should be given to those of California -i production : aiid
In the first place it is to be noted Ant a gift from California will in nine cases out of tbribe
more welcome in a distant State if it be thoroughly Californian in its nature^ â¢ X b rsend^tb the
East from this State something that was made in the East or in Europe wiU be like sending New
castle coal back to Newcastle. Such things are common in the East, There will be nothing
of novelty about them there, no matter how novel they may appear here; and moreover th^y ; wilt
lack the charm which attaches to a gift that represents something of tl^ native beauty and art of
/the land from which it comes. â¢ . â¢ "Â¦-.'. "-.'- -''..' '.'"'-
There is another consideration of importance. California sends abroad every year many
thousands of dollars for Christmas goods when nearly the whole of the amount might just; as
well be kept at home for the promotion of local artistic industries. We do riot at this time pfo^
duce much in the way of Christmas goods, but that is due mainly to the fact that there has been
comparatively little encouragement, given to the manufacture of suchgqods. - : ..
If our people during the Christmas season now opening will send to their friends in the East
as holiday remembrances handsomely packed boxes of California fruits and â¢ wines, or : specimens
of 6ur fine woods wrought- into artistic and useful forms, paintings or photographs, of Califcfnm
scene9 and flowers, and California books and calendars, they will have the gratification of render
ing a sen-ice to the State as well as delighting an absent friend. Bear the fact in mind. In yoirf
holiday shopping patronize home industry. ,. Â¦ ' . ; ; . "\

NOT many months ago The Call secured the services of Marconi :to â¢ report the interna
tional yacht race by \yireless telegraphy, . From the deck of a steamer, he. operated his
. device and transmitted shoreward,, through. the air, every detail of the series of races, arid
it was immediately forwarded by wire across the continent and bulletined for the information of
the public. Each .dispatch was read on The Call building a few minutes after it left Marconi's
boat, so that we furnished to the public in San Francisco, 3500 miles from the 'scene, more
prompt news of every move in the great race than the people on shore in sight of the yachts could
It will be remembered that at least one of our contemporaries in this city, chafing under its
defeat in getting news of the race, and furious because the dense crowd in newspaper triangle
stood back to its bulletins and facing The Call's, sneered and raved at Marconi and 1 beiittied: his
great invention. This was so recently that the newspaper which did. it still smarts at the recollec
tion. But its sneers did not demonstrate anything but its own disappointment. "They did. not urt

PERSONAL MENTION.
A I EARLY all the successful . actors
Â¦|\ I with" -whom I am acquainted -have
I \J a poor opinion .ot dramatic schools.
I .1 That Is natural, . fee each man
\ . I doubtless argues. "I have succeed-*
â¢ ed without the training of a dra
matic school: therefore such training la
unnecessary'." ... -"'.-â¢' Â¦ Â¦' Â¦ . . '
.Such reasoning Is fallacious for two
reasons: First. Jhere is no actor so good
but Uhat he ; might be better, and it is
probable he would be better had he be?n
taught the rudiments oi his profession in
youth, when his mind was plastic and
susceptible to 'the impress of new Ideas.
Second, the school and the library repre
sent the accumulated experience Of the
ajres; the teacher (if he be of the right
kind) represents, at least the accumulated
experience, of a lifetime considerably
longer than that of tae pupil. In the
preparation for- every Â¦ other profession
men save themselves years of toil by
puttlng themselves In touch with school,
library and teacher, and given average In
telligence and capacity on. the-'part of the
pupil, his progress Is proportional to the
excellence of the. school, library and
teacher! How. absurd to suppose, then,
that the. actor's business is the only one
where, self-taught la best-taught! â¢
.In.' the-. November Century Mr. Bronson
Howard calls attention to the valuable
worknow being dene by dramatic schools

Is opportunely confirmed by the accounts
now being received from London of the
half failure of Mr. Stephen Phillips', new
tragedyâ "Herod"â a half-failure due hot
to any â¢ serious faults in the > play, . but to
the hopelessness of the acting, and the
elocution. The heroine, was . played by
Miss Maud Jeffries, accounted one of the
best actresses in England. Mr. Archer

People who noticed names of composers
in their hymabooks then . began to find
out that this must be the Sullivan who
bad composed eo much church and
churchy music, -which made it kll ?he
more comfortable to accept him as a safe

It wotlld have been much . worse : If ' his

Sullivan with that of W. S. GUbeit. the
fuxajy -civil service clerk, -who would not
etlck to his office, and had gone to writing
nonsense verses for "Fun." Gilbert was
only a: Jester, but there was nothing for

the subject for speculation was whether

In XBtLr Before that tiaie the collaborator
of Gilbert was known principally ' as an
Albert . HaJI .concert leader and. a com
poser cf church music. Somewhat earlier
in the decade, between 1S70 and li$S0. Lon
<5on "had begun to take notice of Sullivan.
In that decade, says a. writer .in the New
Tork Tribune, the general belief in Lon
don was that the musical world was lo
cated vaguely "somewhere abroad."
"Pinafore" and "The Pirates" had be
gun the work Of making Sullivan a great
pcpular favorite, and "Patience" complet
ed ft permanently. He might, and did.
go on composing anthems, cantatas and
the : like, and the musical people might
.honor him for them, but to the English
people much more than to English-speak
ing people at large, he was from that time
on the national operatic composer. Be
fore, that the English people had always
taken.it for granted that light opera was
only produced by foreigners and must
necessarily be more or less indecent; now
they understood that Sir Arthur was their
own special operatic composer; they could
not-^the people at larceâ very well think
of him seriously as composing anything
else but what went with Gilbert's non
sense rhymes, and they never did. Neither
could they easily have accepted comic op
eras from any other English composer.
The days of his glory as the royally
patronized priest of music at the Albert
Hall were forgotten, and a good many
people also forgot how much the Albert
Hall movement had done to make It pos
sible for them to appreciate the genuine
beauties of "The Three P's" series.
Sir Arthur Sullivan did not create, but
was only associated with, what made the
chief ; glory: of "Patience'' â the actuality
of It 'in language-, /In costuming. In walk
and attitudesâ but he made the associa
tion as close as it could.be made by the
absolute. Q't of the music to the words. At

might have been, seen: stalking, through
the picture galleries of Bond street. The.
audience at a flrsr performance generally
goes' to criticize; that audience, thanks to
gessip that had- leaked out from the re
hearsal?, went: in a mood' of something
like ; tho delicious expectancy, 'which
schoolboys and schoolgirls feel when the
licur draws near for a. huge practical joke
to be' sprung, The Trail of "Twenty Love-;
sick 3Ialdens" came, at the rise of the
curtaJn that night, and for many nights
after; like a musical caricature- of the
Grosveaor Gallery; young. women whom
everybody had. met by the Â¦ dozen, and
when; they trooped on. the stage a gen
eral gasp of delightful shock ran through
the audience. â¢ About the prototype of
Bunthorne there was ; not a doubt any
where; In .the .house â everybody had seen
him in those Very. same "cobwebby gray
velvet" clothes,- as. he "walked down Pic
cadilly wjth a poppy or a lily, in his me
dieval' hand," and ; many occupants' of
boxes and â¢ stalls aiso recognized Lady
Jane, and Grosvenor as Old acquaintances
in real life. There Was hardly any exag
geration about, either the makeup or the
acting of the eathetlc characters.- It was
all as It. might be in New York to-day if
the xlre?s, language and walk of half a
dozen of the best-known, male and 'female
characters in New York life were- faith
fully reproduced. oh the stage. And as for
the music, the audience felt that, while
they had never heard any of these per
sonages sing in real life, they would sins?
Just such music in just that way If they

H. T. Flnnell was prospecting. Seeing fa
vorable indications he, ran an open cut In the
hillside, and at eighteen feet a large bowlder
was encountered. As the workmen removed
.this a jet of oil spurted from the rock. After
tunning a short dlBtance tne Jet ceased to flow
and the prospectors thought they had been too
sanguine In their expectations, but soon the
oil began to run again. There was the usual
excitement which accompanies a new find and
steps were taken to save the oil. which ran
from the crevice, only an. Inch in width at
the rate of nearly a barrel a day. The flow
of gas was also strong and has made the work
of the prof rectors difficult.
â¢ Still another oil district is reported to
have been discovered In the vicinity of
Los Angeles. It is east of the city on the
old Mission road. The Pacific Union Oil
Company, a Lob Angeles concern, and
four other parties have prepared to ope
rate there. . The field Is directly northwest
of the line of development at Whittler.
â¢ The Weekly Callstogan has a story con
cerning the oil discovery In Berryessa
Valley, thirty-five miles from Napa. It
says:
San Jose has gone oil mad.. On the streets
in. the business office and store. In the count
ing room, bank and club/ in the saloorm, the
hotÂ«Â«l lobby, jeverywhere. In fact, even in the
home Bitting' room, youn* and old, rich and
poor, high and low, are talking oil.
. Southern -California papers, are Circulat
ing a. story that a scheme, of township
plats will. develop beforethe tenth of the
present month, by' which certain schem
ers will endeavor to "Jump" oil lands.
Several oil men are in receipt of notices
so the account goes, warning them to bÂ«
on the lookout for any attempt to put lo
cation, notices upon derricks, as has been
â¢done in the past. . â¢ â¢ . â¢
Thomas. Williams. of .San Jose has vis
ited the southeastern part of San Benito
County and reports discoveries of oil on
Sih-er -Creek. Outcroppings of oil sand
are also reported by Mr. .Williams to ap
pear over a semi-circular area for a dls

that there Is an oil basin of lanje size

Health authorities occurred yesterday
when, an old woman, who was nursing
three children afflicted with the dread dis

dren are very ill from diphtheria ana are
being attended by two physicians. About
midnight Friday Hannah Hansen, who
lives above the flat occupied by the Mc-
Laren family, was, according to Mrs.
Thompson, raising a disturbance with a
man by dancing and singing and having
a good time. The two physicians were
performing a critical operation upon one
of the children at the time and Mrs.
Thompson, went upstairs to ask Mrs.
Hansen to moderate her hilarjty. They
had some words and in her exasperation
Mrs. Thompson admits that she called
Mrs. Hansen a bad name.
Mrs. Har.sen called at the warrant
clerk's office yesterday morning and ue
manded a warrant for Mrs. Thompson's:
arrest on the charge of disturbing the
peace. Clerk Fltzpatrlrk refused to lS3UÂ«;

Dr. Ramsdell In commenting on catarrh
cures says: "I can heartily recommend
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, because they
contain no cocaine nor other dangerous
drug found in so many advertised ca-
tarrh cures. I have known of many cases
of long standing catarrh of the head and
throat completely cured by the daily use
of these tablets for several weeks. One
case in particular, which I could not
reach with an Inhaler or spray and where
the catarrh caused dally headaches and
a noticeable loss of hearing was entirely
cured by this harmless but effective
remedy;" . â¢ .'
Dr. Walnwright says: "I never hesitate
to prescribe Stuart's Catarrh Tablets for
catarrhal headaches and catarrhal deaf-
ness because I know them to be perfectly
pafe for child or adult and have seun
many remarkable \ cures resulting from
their regular daily use; because they are
advertised- and sold in drugstores Is no
reason why any (good physician should
not use them, because we should spize
upon' the means of cure wherever found."
Stuart's Catarrh. Tablets are especially
valuable for catarrhal colds in children
because" they are pleasant to the taste
and may be used 'freely to break up severe
colds and.- croup* at the very beginning.
All -druggists sell the remedy at 50 cents
for full sired package, j

tarrh malled'free by- addressing. the F. A.

throat lozenges contain opiates; theso
cheap medicines irive a temporary relle*.
especially wlih little children, by destroy-
ing nerve, sensation: the Irritation In.
throat, which causes coughing, is tem-
porarily removed, not by removing the
cause, but . by deadening the nerves of
feeling the irritation is not felt although
it Is still there and. will promptly return.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets is the be*t
remedy to remove catarrhal secretion,
whether In the. nose, throat or stomach,
because they are composed of whole-
some antiseptics like icucolyptol. Guala-
col, SaiiKuinuria and Hydrastln; when you
use these tablets you know what you are
putting Into your system and not taking
chances with cocaine, opiates or similar
poisons found in so many catarrh cures
and cough medicines.
People who have used sprays, inhalers,
salves and washes for catarrh and have
found how useless and Inconvenient they
are. will be agreeably surprised at results
following- the use of a pleasant. Internal
remedy In tablet form; druggists every-
where admit that Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets, which they sell at 50 cents for full
sized treatment, is the safest, most ef-
fective and I popular of all catarrh rem-
edies.

SEATTLrE, Dec 1.â The steamship Cen
tennial arrived this afternoon, from Nome
November 8, with the disabled steamer
Santa Ana in tow. The latter vessel lost
two propeller blades shortly after leav
ing Nome and was picked up by the Cen
tennial on November 10 and towed into
Dutch Harbor. In the delay Incident to
picking up the disabled vessel the Centen
nial ran out of coal and to reach Dutch
Harbor It was necessary to break up a
lot of the temporary superstructure, put
up during the summer, and the lumber ln
the cattle stalls for fuel. In this way the
two vessels made Dutch Harbor on No
vember 16, where coal for the remainder
of the voyage was obtained and whence
they sailed on November 21.
The Centennial dumped into this city
twenty-two men of disreputable character
Â¦who were ordered out of Nome by the
peace ollicers and wnose passage was
paid by subscriptions -jf Nome merchants.
The deportation of the disorderly classes
was decided upon- just before the Centen

It was learned to-day that when Ber

sobbed that' he was sorry and did not
mean to hit her and that she replied that
she would forgive him. It Is rumored ln

lived that Bertolas was extremely Jeal

woman. The officers appear to place but
little confidence In Bertolas' story of a
burglary committed in his house on the
evening preceding the shooting.
Bertolas. It Is said, has made several
statements in regard to the case that do
not quite coincide., His first explanation
was that he was lying in bed when he
heard what he thought was a burglar en
tering the house and that he got up and
took a shot at the Intruder. It was later
learned that Bertolas was fully dressed
when he reached the house where hla
wife sought shelter on being shot and that
he arrived almost as soon as she did.
When asked to account for this Bertolas
said that he was down in his cellar when
he beard the noise of some one entering:
the house. Asked where his wife had
been he said that he did not know.

surrounds the shooting of Mrs. Bertolas

SELECTING THE SITE
FOR COALING STATION
Admiral Bradford Puts in an After
noon on the Shores of San
Diego Bay.
SAN DIEGO, Dec. 1.â Admiral R. B.
Bradford arrived this noon to select the
site for the coaling station which is to be
established here. There Is no doubt that
the station will te located on the bay, but
there were three or four sites under con
sideration, and the admjral spent the aft
ernoon tramping over the shores of the
bay looking at them- Two are on the mil
itary reservation at Point Loma, and It Is
likely that one of them wlil be selected.
One has the advantage of having deep
water almost up to the shore, but- with
little level ground near It. The other, has
ample ground, but wharves of some length
would have to be built.
While here Admiral Bradford is the
guest of the Chamber of Commerce. It is
his first visit to San Diego, and he ex
pressed : himBelf as being delighted with
the location of the city and the landlocked
condition of the bay. -

MRS. ST. CLAIR'S BODY
FOUND IN A WELL
Discovery That Clears tlie Mystery
of a Disappearance at Los
Angeles:
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 1.â The discovery
of the. body of Mrs. Maiy St. Clalr in an
abandoned .well at 174 Hewitt street thlÂ»
afternoon has cleared the mystery of her
disappearance eleven days ago during the
heavy, storm.' On the evening of Novem
ber : 21 St. > Clair retired earlier than hla
wife. Subsequently he awoke and found
her absent, but It was not until she failed
to appear to cook his breakfast that he
became alarmed. "Â£*Â£S&dww*SÂ«ag3&K^
Several days elapsed.. but as Mrs. St.
Clair had Â¦ previously absented herself for
short periods he kept his own counsel and
did not inform hi3 wife's sister till last
Friday. Subsequently that lady, a Mrs.
Garrity, was troubled . by a dream ; In
which, she declared, her sister implored
her help from drowning. Mrs. Ganity In
sisted on an investigation and finally per
suaded St. Clair .to explore the depths of
an - abandoned t well near his house. The*
.body' was almost covered by earth, the
well having caved in when the woman
fell. The assistance ' of * the Fire Depart
ment was enlisted for the exhumation.
The s theory is advanced ' that Â¦: Mrs.- St
Clalr had approached the well to pick up
an evening paper which, had been thrown
thereby a' carrier 'and that the grround,
which was soft, gave" way beneath her.
She must have fallen sixty-four feet. 4
Mr. and MrÂ«. St.- Clair were married In
Fort Scott, Kana., In 1874. and have resld-
Special Dispatch to The CaXL
SACRAMENTO, Dec 1.â At a meeting
of the directors of the State Board of
Agriculture to-day it was decided to make
a radical move, toward the converting of
the present Agricultural Park racecourse
into residence lots and the establishment
of another racecourse, at least tempo
rarily, in the unoccupied area lying to the
eastward of the present park. A com
mittee was appointed to Investigate as to
the feasibility of such a movement and
report at the next meeting of the board-*
January 12.
It was expecjed that the board would
at to-day's session elect a secretary to
fill the vacancy caused by the election of
Peter J. Shields to the Superior . bench,
it was decided, however, to defer the elec
tion to a date to be fixed later, and Harry
Louden, one of. Mr. Shields' office force,
was chosen to occupy the position â¢ until
a permanent choice shall have been mado.
There are many aspirants for the position,
but It is said that the directors are abso
lutely unpledged to any of them.
The retirement^ of Peter J. Shields from
the position of secretary was made the
occasion to-day of several addresses tes
tifying to the esteem In which he is held
by the directors and to their satisfaction
at his promotion, through the votes of the
people, to judicial honors. Â¦
A committee of the directors was Ap
pointed to confer with Governor Gage and
endeavor to obtain his co-operation In a
plan to pay oft the debt of the agricul
tural societies. .

FRANK R. STEELE. Pacific Coast
manager of the Western Union
Telegraph Company, fell : dead,
presumably from heart disease,
while returning to his homo In
Oakland on the 4:45 o'clock narrow gauge
ferry-boat yesterday afternoon. Mr.
Steele was slttingr In the cabin on the
lower deck, quietly reading a newspaper,
when he suddenly gave a moan of pain
and lurched forward, falling off his seat
before assistance reached him. He ex
pired almost Instantly.
Physicians on the boat responded quick
ly, but the patient was pronounced dead.
There was not a person on the boat who
knew Mr. Steele, and his body remained
unidentified for some time after death
occurred. As soon as the steamer reached
the Alameda pier the body was removed
to the Oakland train. Coroner. Mehrmann
was notified and the remains were taken
from the train when It arrived at Four
teenth and Franklin street station, Oak
land." and removed to the morgue. When
the deputies searched the clothing docu
ment* were found which disclosed the
identity of the body. .-
Mr. Gteele's residence Is a pretty cot
tage at 2431 Piedmont avenue, where bis
Mr. Steele had been ailing for some tlnio
and had been under treatment' for optical
difficulty as well as a heart trouble, but
his condition was not deemed serious or
in any way alarming. He had been at his
post of duty without interruption.
Manager Steele had been in the employ
of the Western Union Telegraph Company
since his boyhood. By perseverance and
application and fidelity he had risen from
a humble position to that of manager
of one of the largest departments in tho
company's service. Although only 37
years of age he waÂ» one of the most com
petent men In the great corporation's
employ. He was a natlvo of vlckabur.r,
Miss., and entered the telegraph com
pany'a eervico as . a, messenger bar. la
wife and two young children were await
ing hie home-ooming. The Coroner's dep
uties went to neighbors and through them
the news of her husband's death was
broken to Mrs. Steele shortly - after 7
o'clock this evening. The shock was a
terrible one, as nothing more remote than
the thoupht of death had been in the be
reaved wife's mind. Friendly hands took
charge of affairs until the .news of the
death could be transmitted to the West
ern Union Telegraph : Company In this
city. As quickly as possible several of
the late manager's assistants were dis
patched to the residence to take charge of
the household affairs and the arrange
ments for the funeral. .

This action Is taken in anticipation of
Congressional action upon the pending
NIcaraguan canal bill and the Hay-
Pauncefoto treaty. Pending the submis
sion of the treaty to the Senate, which
body must ratify the agreement, its terms
will not be made public It is understood,
however, that generally Nicaragua grants
to the United States. Government the ex
clusive right to construct and operate the
canal between the Atlantic and Pacific
across Nicaragua, including thÂ» free use
of the San Juan River* and of Lake Mana
gua as part of the water course. Nicara
gua is also to rid herself of any outstand
ing treaties that would tend in any way
to abridge the privileges to be acquired
by the United States. It is understood
also that Nicaragua concedes to the
United States lull authority to police the
canal. Nicaragua ls to receive in compen
sation a certain amount of the securities
of the canal construction company, and
although it ls not possible now to learn
the figure set down In the treaty it is be
lieved to approximate $3,000,000.
The State Department already has en
tered into an arrangement on similar
terms with the republic of Costa Rica.
This was because Costa Rica has estab
lished a claim to the right bank of the
San Juan River, which must of necessity
form about a third of the length of the
canal should the Nicaragua route be se
lected and be constructed on the lines
which will be suggested by the "Walker
commission.
"WASHINGTON, Dec 1.â Secretary Hay
this morning for the Government of the
United States and Benor Correa, the Nica
raguan Minister, for his own Government,
signed a treaty 'whereby the latter Gov
ernment concedes to the Government of
the United States the necessary rights
and provides within her bestowal for the
construction of the NIcaraguan canal.

Miss Elsie Tooker, the renowned San
Francisco guitarists, have returned to
their home at 1157 Octavla street after a
visit to ICew York and the Eastern cities.
While East Miss Tooker gave exhibitions
of her ability as a guitarist before several
appreciative audiences, and .was called by
the leading musical critics "The Queen of
Guitarists." The Â« Philadelphia Journal
says: "Her technique is absolutely fault
less, ebe performs the most difficult of
music with an easy grace that is charm
ing in the extreme, while her shading and
general interpretation are those of a heav
en-born artist." These ladies have decided
to take a limited number eff pupils. â¢
Teamster Charles Zelgler, employed by
the quartermaster's department at the
Presidio, met with an accident yesterday
that came within an ace of causing his
death. He was driving a pair of mules
hitched to one of the huge, unwieldy army
wagons and on approaching the gradd
near the entrance to the Presidio attempt
ed to put on the brake. In some unac
countable manner his foot slipped from
the brake rod and he was thrown out
6trlking on his head. The fall rendered
him unconscious and he remained so for
some time.
| . Zeigler was taken to the Post Hospital
and held for observation, as a fracture of
the skull was feared. Late in the day he
came to and an examination disclosed the
fact that be had suffered only a slight
concussion.

Prosecution Decides Not to Put Olin
Castle on the Stand Until
Later in the
Case.
EL. DORADO, Kans., Dec. 1.â The razor
with which Jessie Morrison cut Mrs. Cas
tle's thrdat was identified in court to-day
by Miss Clara Cowles and the prosecution
introduced It as evidence against the pris
oner. Miss Cowles testified that she
found the razor, which was blood
fimeared, on the floor near where Mrs.
Castle lay. The defense objected to its
introduction, but the court overruled the
objection. Two other witnesses testified
that they had seen Miss Morrison with a
knife cr something similar in her hand
after she had been taken from the Castle
home by neighbors. Others testified to
the prisoner having entered the house, ap
parently of her own accord, before ttie
murder was committed. The defense in
its statement of the case said that it
would show that Mrs. Castle called Miss
Morrison into the house and then at
tacked her. : ;V:-,:
Olin Castle was to have been on the
stand to-day, but in the light of-yester
day's proceedings the prosecution has
changed its programme and his evidence
will come later. Before the taking of tes- :
tlmony had commenced it was stated that i
the defense would produce evidence to
show that Miss Morrison had been en
gaged to Castle at the time he married
Mies Mary Wiley, but the opening state
ment yesterday of the prisoner's attorney
removed the probability of such charges
being: mado and caused the prosecution to
reserve Castle's examination. for another
time. Â¦
The courtroom to-day was crowded as
usual. No change was apparent in the
prisoner.
Dr. M. A. Koogler, the first physician
to reach the Castle house on the morning
of the tragedy, testified that Mrs. Castle
was about bled to death when he arrived
and that -she died from the effects of the I
cutsHn her throat.
Pearl Beardsley. a delivery boy, ' who
had entered the house with a package of
meat, said he helped Mrs. Spangler raise
Miss Morrison. Miss Morrison told him,
"She tried to kill me; I had to do it. 1 '
"Miss Morrison," continued Beardsley,
"had a knife in her hand, and when I
asked her for It she grabbed her dress
with her left hand and covered her right."
Miss Ruby Moberly, daughter of Mrs.
Betty Moberly, said Bhe went to the Castle
house after her mother and saw Jessie
Morrison coming out of the house.
"You may state what, if anything, you
saw in the defendant's hand," said Attor
ney Brumback. â¢
"I saw a blade in her hand," replied the
witness.
"Was it in her right of left hand?"
"I did not notice."
Miss Clara Cowles, who llred acroas the
street from the Castles, told of seeing
Beardsley enter the house of Mrs. Moberly
and Mrs. Spangler and emerging with
Jessie Morrison and of the latter strug
llug to get away. She corroborated the
testimony in this respect given yesterday
by Mrs. Moberly and Mrs. Spangler.
Miss Cowles testified that she found a
bloody razor near Mrs. Castle's knees.
"I was the first to pick up the razor,"
she said.
The razor was produced by Attorney
Brumback and Identified by witness, and
the attorney stated that- he wished to in
troduce it as evidence. I The defense ob
jected, but the objection was overruled. â¢â¢'
John Bailey, a boy, testified that he met
Jessie Morrison on the morning of the
tragedy just outside the Castle gate and
that she going toward the Castle hÂ«ne.
Mrs. Grace Lemon told of seeing Miss
Morrison going toward the Castle home,
but saw nothing unusual about her. .
Mrs. Maggie Clark testified to seeing
Miss Morrison going 'Â¦'Â¦ toward the Castle
house on the morning in question, and,
asked if the prisoner .had anything in her
hand, replied!
"Bhe had a paper in her left hand."
"What shape was the paper?"
"It looked to be rolled up." ;<Â¦'-
Charles B. Smith also testified to seeing
Miss Morrison '-going toward the Castle
house on the morning of the tragedy.
At the afternoon session- Mrs. Abble
Castle, mother-in-law of the murderad
woman, identified a email piece of black
enamel found In cleaning the house after
the murder. It is the theory of the prose
cution that this was part of a knife or
razor carried by Miss Morrison.'
At 2 o'clock the Jury was excused while
the lawyers argued the point of admitting
as evidence the statement of Mrs Moberly
that the note written by Mrs. Castle con
tained these words, "Jessie Morrison has
killed me."

in to see the football game," McCauley
said yesterday; "but at the gate I was
turned away, as I had no ticket. On ac

would not take money. Another young
fellow was turned away at the same time,
and together vie went around and entered
the glass works premises. There was no
one stopping the men and boys, who were
going throush by hundreds. We climbed
Fifteenth street from Harrison, looking
for: an Opportunity to get up on the roof
of one of the furnace houses of the glass

work digging a hole under the glass works

. "The horror of those minutes during
which I clung to that rod will never leave
me.' After a while I recovered my pres

FATE OF TWO BROTHERS.
One Was Stanford's Mascot and the
Other Plunged to Torment,
Perhaps I>eath.
One of the most remarkable coinci
dences of the glass works fatality. was
that involving Peter Carroll, a lad 17
years of age. who lies in St. Mary's Hos
pital with a. fractured skull and for whose
life the doctors hold out little hope, and
his little brother, Jimmie. Â¦ While the
elder brother was plunging to what may
prove his death the younger, clad in cardi
nal sweater as the mascot of the Stanford
team, was helping the rooters cheer his
heroes.
Jlmmle Carroll has been the mascot of
the Stanford team for two years.
On his removal to. St. Mary's Hospital.
Peter Carroll was found to have sustained
a fracture of the skull. Prior to being
taken to St. Mary's the Injured boy was
driven to the railroad hospital. -His
mother, Mrs. Lee. and his stepfather,
John Lee, take turns in watching at his
bedside. The doctors do not hold out
much hope of the lad's recovery.
CITY'S DAY OF FUNERALS.
Twelve Hearse-Led Lines of Carriages
Will- Thread Streets to
Cemeteries.
More than half of the victims of. the
Thanksgiving day tragedy will be buried
to-day, and in almost every district of
San Francisco the sad ceremony over the
body of some schoolboy or youthful
bread-winner will cast a still deeper gloom
over the people. San Francisco has felt
the awful horror of the. accident, but of
Its people comparatively* few have seen
the .actual scars. To-day every one
will see some one of the lines of car
riages with grief-stricken. parents, broth
ers, sisters, schoolmates, following a
small coffin to the grave, and the grief of
the time will be brought home to each.

Wollwert got on to the ventilator with
the others and went down when the roof
caved in. He received a dislocation of the
right shoulder and several contused
wounds about the r head. Fearing the
anger of his mother he concealed his In

him too much pain to be longer endured.
The plucky little fellow was sent to the

BORNE TO THE GRAVE.
Hector McNeill the First Victim to
B3 Carried to His Last Best
ing Place.
Hector McNelll was buried in Laurel
Hill Cemetery yesterday. The death
which was abroad on Thankglving day
found an early victim in him, and his body
is the first of those killed in the disaster
to be consigned to the grave.
It was a simple funeral. Simple, that Is.
in all but the flowers, In wreaths, crosses
and bunches which filled . the room in
which the lad's coffin iay at 762 Post
street with fragrance. There was a great
wreath of violets and maidenhair, the
gift of the boy's fellow employes at tho
White House, and another of white roses
and ferns from the attaches of O'Connor
& Moffatt, where the" dead boy had
formerly worked. On the coffin lay a
wreath of sinaple white roses. It had been
placed there by the. bereaved mother.
At 1 o'clock yesterday those friends and
relatives of the deceased who were to be
present at the last rites had met and
heard the funeral services read by the
Rev. M. M. White. r Among the mourners
were Raphael Weill and "Benjamin M.
Joseph. The former Is proprietor, of the
White House and "the latter foreman of
the department in which young McNeill
worked. There were twelve pallbearers
from the White House and O'Connor &
Moffatt's. - . *
Though only fourteen years old, 1 the boy
had earned in no ordinary degree the
confidence and esteem of his employers
anfl the lovo of. his fellow-workers. He
was a, member of the"Y.' M. "C. A. Night
School, where he was accredited an apt
scholar. He contributed largely to the
support of his widowed -mother and little
sister. His mother; is -mourning for her
dead boy with a grief that, can know no
palliation; her little daughter does not
fully, realize what her brother's loss is to
mean. Mrs. Josle McNelll' brought -her
little family from Texas to San Francisco
but a few months ago, llttle : dreaming
that the step meant death to one of them
and that one her, only son.* : ,Â¦
On ' the '; fateful Thursday ' night, : while
the dead were being carried to the Morgue
and many were breathing their last in the
shambles of the glass* works, Mrs. McNelll
and her little daughter sat waiting at the
Thanksgiving table in their home, waiting
for the -boy's .return. He had set. out in
tha afternoon with fifty cents in his pock
et, gaily declaring that for the sum < he
would see the great game from some point
of vantage. "Qood-by. mother,". Mrs.
McNelll says he cried as he left the house.
"I'll be back to dinner,',' and so they wait-"
ed for him until a ; police officer came to
the door and told them . that their boy
was not corning home that' night and per
haps never.
â¢The-Whltft House employes generously
raised a purse of $100 to aid. Mrs. McNelll

up the ladder and crossed over to the oth
er building. As soon as we got up on the
ventilator roof I felt that it was not a
safe proposition, and I told my chance
acquaintance bo, and proposed that we
should leave. He consented, and Just' then,
not a minute after we had clambered up,
the roof collapsed.
"I must have etruck a timber Just be
low the roof, for I remember nothing after
the first instant. When I came to, I was
lying in a heap of injured men and boys,
and my clothing was wet with their
blood. I freed myself from the tangle
and was among the first taken to the
Southern Pacific Hospital. I do not know
whether my cbance acquaintance was
killed or not, but I am certain that he fell
with the rest of us."
Thomas Curran, an Ironworker who
lives at the corner of Twenty-sixth and
Mission streets, had an almost miraculous
escape from death, and he gives a graphic
description cf the catastrophe. He said
last evening:
"I -was with a young fellow whom I had
met on the roof. He was a mechanic, and
I think he must have been Thomas Rlp
pon from the descriptions given by the
papers. We were on the very peak of the
roof. Suddenly, without any creaking or
cracking to give us warning, the roof sank
beneath us. I went over backward; struck
a beam, which changed my direction, and
fell about twelve feet further. That
brought me to the level of the ceiling
Joists, and as I fell I managed to seize an
iron rod, vertical in position, a brace for
one of the joists. I clung to it with all
the strength of my arms and finally man
aged to throw one of my legs over it. My
experience in clambering around over the
framework of buildings no doubt saved
my life. â¢
"As I clung there I saw the poor fellow
who had been chatting with me strike
the furnace. He curled up Just like a
worm in that heat, and I saw the tender
come out and turn off the flame and then
drag my companion off the furnace.
"Bodies were falling like a hail, and I
could hear them strike the furnace or the
concrete floor. Then I could see the
struggles of the poor maimed fellows.
One poor boy was trying to pull himself
off the furnace by an iron brace which
not as vigilant as they might have been
in taking precautions to keep people out
of tlie grounds, there is practically noth
ing- to prove that the permission of the
Klass' works people was given for the
crowd to enter.. At the inquest, however.
it is hoped that the question will bo fuily
answered.
The various hospitals of the city have
now rendered practically the last service
which it was in their power to give in
connection with the terrible affaiY-. The
groat majority of the victims have been
removed to their Jiomes, where, however
well they may be nursed, they will hardly
receive better care than they did at the
public hospitals. The officers, physicians,
nurses- and stewards of these institutions
deserve the highest tribute of praise
which may be given to them. At a time
wn*n their services were most impera
tively needed they responded willingly, in
telligently and splendidly to the duty
p!aced upon them.
The oread concluding incidents of the
tragedy have now begun. The first
funeral of one of the victims took place
yesterday from the home of his stricken
parents. Many more will take place to
day and thousands of the people of San
Francisco will pay the tribute of their
gym pa thy -to those who have suffered
from death's visitation. Â¦ -.;r._

his long watch, had been forced to seek
rest and so was not at his son's bedside
when death came.
The injuries received by young Cum

conscious to the last. His skull was frac
tured and his left lung was punctured by
the splintered end of a fractured rib. Be
sides these the boy received many minor
cuts and bruises.'

-Thomas C. Pedler, Fred F. Lilly and
Charles Fulton are all in a precarious
condition at the City and County Hospi

by Dr. Stanley Stlllmari. assisted by
House Surgeons Thorn and Osmers. A
segment of the spine Â»was removed. The
Epinal cord Itself was found to have suf
fered some destruction, and little hope
of his recovery is entertained, though his
condition was encouraging during the day.
The entire lower portion of his body is
paralyzed.
Fred F. Lilly, tho son of a well-to-do
New York merchant, is apparently ap
proaching death. He was conscious Fri
day, though his skull was fractured, the
frontal bone having bten caved In. Yes
terday he lay unconscious and there is
hardly any doubt that his name will be
added to the list of dead. Dr. Thomas

death is practically certain.
Charles Fulton, 24 years old, whose
home is at 3 Hermann street, has a com

A brave fight for. life aealnst the
crushing odds of fever and internal in
juries is that being waged by Hamilton
Woods of 1S1 Thirteenth street, one of the
most severely injured of those left alive.
The boy, who is but 11 years old. knew the
full force of the feaiful fall to death.
Against the brick floor, he just missing
the oven in his fall, the base of his skull
was crushed, his chin was fractured, he
was horribly cut and maltwisted about
the face, his legs were broken and every,
inch of his little body was bruised. Yet
he lives and his stepfather, A. M. Wal
tens, says that while there is life there is
hope. The little sufferer was one of the
brightest pupils of the Peabody School
and a general favorite with ail who knew
him.

Â«PHILADELPHIA, Dec. l.-On
Franklin field to-day the navy re
trieved Its defeat of last year by
thrashing the army, by the score
of 11 to 7. It was a fierce contest
from beginning to end and was only won
by the hardest kind of playing on the part
of Annapolis cadets. The West Point boys
in the face of defeat never for a moment
weakened in their play, and won applause
and honor for their -gameness. Neither
team played gilt-edged football, but what
they lacked in the finer points of the game
the elevens more than made up by thÂ«
earnestness of individual endeavor.
The greatest crowd that has assembled
on Franklin field in a number of years
was out to see the game, and many 1 men
distinguished In public life occupied seats
on either the West Point or the Annapolis
stands. Secretary Root and a party,
which included Lieutenant General Miles,
occupied a box on the army' side, and
when the War Secretary made his appear
ance he was honored by. the West Point
Academy yell. In other boxes and ecat
tered through the crowd in the soldiers'
stand were many other army officers, past
end present. Secretary Long was unable
to attend the game, but the .Navy . De-'
partment was just as fully represented in
numbers as was the other arm of the Gov
ernment service. Members of the'diplo
matic corps were on the navy stand, as
were also -a half-dozen officers of the Rus
sian imperial navy who are temporarily
stationed in this country.
Before the game began West Point was
the favorite in the betting, but within five
minutes after the kick-off it was Eeen that
whoever won would have to fight for the
victory. The Annapolis boys started out
with auch vigor that It was thought they
would win easily, but the West Pointers
kept their heads and settled down to a
determined contest. Both teams were
guilty of considerable fumbling, and most
of these mlsplays were made at critical
points In the b 'ame. As far as line buck-
Ing and plunging were concerned neither
team was the marked superior of the
other. Both lines, except In a few in
stances, when the ground gained was not
great, held quite firmly, which compelled
the captains to resort, to end running. At
this style of playing West Point was a lit
tle more successful. One of the features
of the game was the numerous attempts
made by Dong of the navy to kick goals
from the field. Eight times the "middies
worked the ball to within the army s for-,
ty-yard line, ond eight times Long tried
for a goal, the first three tries were
badly aimed, his next four attempts vrerp
blocked and on the eighth try the ball
sailed beautifully between the goal-posts.
His perseverarice won for him * ne - *Â£"Â¦
plause of army, and navy supporters alike.
In the' punting line the navy had mucn
the better of It. During the llrst hall
Belknap had difficulty in placing his
kicks, whidh were also rather short, put
in the second period of play his punting
was almost perfect. - â¢ .Â¦ Â¦Â¦;Â¦ '
There was a vast difference in the inter
ference of the two elevens. â¢'Whenever -.a
navy Cadet had the ball he was seldom
protected, while the army's runner was
well covered. Â¦ . â¢ . '-
Th-> first score made by either side was
a field goal by Clark for West Point. The
navy had ma do four attempts at a field
goal up to this time and on the last try
the army secured the ball on the kick be
ing blocked. The West Pointers -slowly
worked the leather to the navy's tw.enty
flve-yard line and then Clark dropped
back and booted the balljbetween the goal
posts. There was no more scoring in the
first half. ,
In the second half the Annapolis cadets
got possession of the ball on the ten-yard
line on a fumble after an .exchange of
kicks. Long, for the navy, dropped back
five yards for his seventh trial for a field
goal, but the ball was blocked and one of
his own men secured it. He immediately
tried it again on the flfteen-yard line and
this time he was successful, which tied
the scorer. â¢ -
A few minutes late the middles forged
to the front. They secured the ball on the
In-field on an exchange of kicks and Belk
nap punted to the army's ten-yard line,
where one of. tho soldier halfbacks fum
bled the leather and a gallor dropped on
it. The middies tried the right of the
army's line, but failed' to gain.
On the next line-up, however, Land was
given the ball and went through the West
Point line like a flash for the only touch
down scored in the game. Fowler Ttlcked
the goal. â¢ ' Â¦ Â¦'Â¦-.-"Â¦
Shortly before time was called the navy
got the ball on a kick on their own five
yard line. Belknap attempted to kick it
out of danger, biit Finn blocked the effort
and the ball rolled over the firoal line. It
was a desperate moment and both teams
tore after the bounding leather, but Long
fell on it for a safety and prevented the
possibility of West Point tying the score.

The day's results, with Judge John
Grace's ofllclal scores, follow:
The run-down of the big 112-dog open
stake at Union Coursing Park yesterday
was productive of many good tests.'; In
the lirst half of the programme â¢' elaven
ihort-ends upset calculations and kept the
wise ones guessing in' their efforts toSplck
a winner. v Kxceptine the course inlwhlch
Way. Hemps tead outworked Santonin the
favorites were led to . the hare, jff Form
players had better luck In the last half,
however, as all but three of their selec
tions had their colors raised. Narcissus
tooK an easy victory from Sir Crawford,
doing but light worK and by his clever
tr.ess keeping his opponent away from the
game and preventing a point being made
against him.
Â¦ The finals to-day are made up of evenly
matched does and close and interesting
coursing Is predicted. -Wedgewood had a
short run, which will not hurt his chances.
Floodgate had easy going and ls looked
upon to reach well down on the card.
Vandal showed considerable dash and vim
In his course with Ben Lomond, leading
a good distance from the start and shut
ting out Parkinson's dog In the adding
up of points. Vandal ls a candidate for
one of the good places on the bottonx of
the card and it would not be surprising if
he were a contestant In the deciding
course.
Are Strong Candidates for
Position. .

John Corlett, an English Turfman,
Pays a Generous Tribute.
LONDON, Dec. 1.â No more teneroua
tribute to the American jockey's horse
manship could be written than appears in
tho Sporting Times, over the signature of
John-Corlett, one of tne.best racing au
thorities in England and himself a horse
6wner. He -points '.out" that no less than
five Americans are included In the first
ten winning" jockeys of the year and says
It would have been six if Maher had come
over earlier. 'He continues:/ â¢
"There is no such: conservative anj*
where ; as the ,Bng'lish turfman -and wo
have said enough to: ahow the amount of
prejudice the "American jockeys have had
to conquer. There is one thing, however,
(hat the English ! turfman thoroughly be
.llevesin.'and thatis petting there. This
the Americans *havo" done with a
.vengeance, and' It is sheer merit which has
secured them. | the position : they now hold
even In England." ' \ . -.: Â¦;,
The general^ and Augenblick explained
the facts to Warrant Clerk Peery, who
expressed a doubt as to the case coming
under 1 the category of trick arid device.
He wrote 'out the complaint, but none of
the Judges would sign It after hearing
Augenbllck's statement, and to-morrow
the faro players will probably get back
their money. â¢
The faro players arrested in the Bur
lington House, Market street, again ap
peared before Judge" Conlan yesterday,
and tho Judge finally accepted their plea
of guilty.'... Ha' sentenced Frank McDon
ald, the conductor, to pay a fine of $20. and
on the four visitors. $5 each, remarking
that he could not see any distinction be
tween white and Chinese gamblers.
General Salomon, representing Mark
Augenbllck, proprietor of a saloon on
Market street." opposite Jones, asked the
Judge not to sign an order for the return
of the money â¢ found on the defendants
when arrested, as it had been obtained
from Augenbllck by trick and device. He
Intended securing warrants for their ar
rest on the charge of grand larceny. They
had Induced Augenbllck to play the game
by false representations, and he lost $550.
The Judge agreed not to issue 'the order

LOS AXGEL.ES. Dec. 1.â H. H. Lyons.
F. A. Harrington and Tom Brennan of
the Lcs Angeles Coursing Club are
charged with conspiring to commit a
crime. In addition Lyons Is cited to ap
pear before Justice Jameson on a com
plaint alleging cruelty to animals. Tho
first named offense is punishable by a fine
of $1000 or one year in the county Jail.
The accusations are the outgrowth of the
fight to prevent coursing in this vicinity
and on the issue probably depends tho
fate of the sport in Los Angeles County.
Not only this, but the new phase of tho
fight will enable the matter to be brought
to the attention of â¢ ;he Supreme Court

which will be of vital importance to

1>6 Not Delay,
There is apparently no end to the racing
luck of Walter Jennings. On Thanksgiv
ing day his spanking good three-year-old
Ve^bvian annexed the autumn handicap,
with his stable companion Andrisa a close
third. At Tanforan Park yesterday An
drisa., with Mounce in the saddle, took the
Gold Vase, one of the more classic of the
Ban Francisco Jockey Club's new stakes,
from a select field. Under the conditions
of the race the filly got in with ninety
eight pounds on her back, and the 3% to 1
laid In the ring looked most appetizing to
the Saturday gathering of race-goers.
Green Morris felt positive Modrine, carry-
Ing only 108, would be well nigh Invincible,
and though a mile Is a trifle further than
the colt wants to go he was made the fa
vorite. Wooster Boy and Gonfalon, the
Hildreth pair, and the game but roughly
used Advance Guard came . in for their
ehare of support. The Lady seemed the
least bit outclassed at first glance, espe
cially as she picked up 105 pounds, but she
surprised seven out of ten turfites by her
showing. The horses were called after the
deciding, of the hurdle event, and Starter
Dwyer released the barrier to an almost
perfect start. There was some of the cus
tomary crowding at the first turn, which
did not do Wooster Boy much good, for
he was never after prominent. For the
first half-mile John A, Morris and Modrine
did some catchy stunts out in front, and
retired. The Lady then picked up the run
ning, but Andrisa, only galloping, was
soon at her elde. Mounce Just called on
his mount once, and though Ross "set It
in" hard on. The Lady, Andrisa won by
three lengths in 1:40 flat. Behind Ezell's
mare, Modrine and Advance Guard had it
hot and heavy for third place honors,
Turner on Guard getting the decision by a
nose. The value of the stake to the win
ner. In addition to the beautiful gold vase
valued at $1000, was $2403 75. The second
horse received $400, the third $200.
Favorites started in well by capturing
the first three numbers, which ended their
part in the exercises. The other winners
ell received backing with the exception
of Free Pass, which seemed to have been
overlooked. â¢:â¢-Â¦'-'.â¢>
Courtier, from the stable of Louis
Ezell. with Winnie O'Connor up, found
time to win the opening spin for maiden
two-year-olds. An even money chance It
took some riding to land him first at the
Starter Dick Dwyer has asked Princo
Ponlatowski to be allowed to use the re
call flag. While his work during the meet-
Ing Just ended has been of the highest or
der it appears Dick Is fearful a mistake
will happen and hÂ« will come In for severe
censure. The PrlncÂ© is loth to concede tho
request. â¢ .
Bob Smith, with a carload of, fourteen
horse*, arrived at Ingleside track -from
New Tork yesterday. Among Bob's lo*
are Colonel Roosevelt and Orayfeld, two
very useful performers. In the- car came
Beau Ormonde, the Â«on of Ormonde,
owned by W. O'B. Macdonough.
Andrisa is a product of Rancho del PaÂ«o
and after the stake race Walter Jennings
said he Intended presenting tho magnifi
cent gold vase to J. Ii. Hagrgln, owner of
the great breeding farm. Mr. Jennings la
popular with turfmeu the country over
and the mare's victory wu a dectdedlv
popular one.
As Advance Guard was a starter in tho
stake event it was with the permission
of the Judges that Jack Martin, who la
under contract to Carruthens & Shields
was allowed to ride Wooster Boy. It wrb
reported Sam Hildreth gave $500 for th<j
boy's services, which is doubtful.
Canmore Is a half brother to Andrisa.
the gold vase winner. '
There will likely be some changes
among the executive staff of the San
Francisco Jockey Club before the next
meeting at Tanforan Park. At least
Prince Poniatowskl j said i yesterday the
directors had in view some such move,
but nothing definite had as yet been de
cided upon. According to the president of
the San Francisco Jockey Club there will
"be a sort of general reorganization of
affairs. D. Lynch Pringle will probably
fill a position where the duties are less
arduous and Racing Secretary Ralph To
zer may also be changed about. Ed Cole,
now acting as associate judge, is men
tioned for the position of secretary, which
would leave a vacancy to be filled In the
stand. The meeting just closed haa been
a most successful one and the Tanforan
management feel highly elated over the
patronage given the track. Before an
other meeting draws around the building
will be repainted and several improve
ments made. !

wire two Jengths before Raveling, the
third choice.'
Following this came the two-year-old
handicap. Sam Hildreth decided to
scratch Golden Age and let Selde run for
him, which fact sent Canmore to the post
a 6 to 5 choice. Mounce and the favorite
did not get away from the post particu
larly well, but In the. stretch, with the
remaining starters pretty well out, Can
more shook them of! and came home in
handy fashion. Showing- some of her old
time speed, Janice lost the place to TVr
by a neck. Articulate ran disappointingly.
Not required to take up any additional
weight for winning, Eva Moe.'at odds of
2 to 5. beat a limited collection of Jumpers
without effort. Lomo kept her close
company throuRhout, but was unfor
tunate to stumble and dislodge his rider
after taking the last Jump. Mestor then
finished second.
To Wedderstrand could be ascribed the
defeat of Coming Evont. 4 to 5 favorite,
for the mile run for fillies. He chased
out after Kitty Kelly when It was dollars
to nothing that she would not stay half
the route. When Coburn made his last
move on Mitten nearly opposite the pad
dock Coming Event' was ttred and fell
easy prey to the Simons ent y.
Twelve dusty looking ?n.~ : Jens started
in the final event wi':h 1 irÂ»g-a-Llng and

winner turned up in Free Pass, a 15 to 1

Of Treating Files and Rectal Diseases.
The old method of treating piles by the
knife, by ligature or dilatation , besides
causing: intense pain and frequently col-
lapse and death, are now known to be
worse than useless as far as actually cur-
ing the trouble ls concerned.
Derang-ement of the liver and other In-
ternal organs, as well aa constipation,
often cause piles, and It ls a mistake to
treat It as a purely local disease; this ls
the reason why salves and ointments have
bo little effect, and the widespread suc-
cess of the Pyramid Pile Cure haa demon-
strated it.
The Pyramid Pile Cure Is not a salve
nor ointment, but 1Â» In suppository form,
which ls applied at night, absorbed into
the sensitive rectal membrane . and . acts
both as a local and constitutional treat-
ment and In cases of many years' stand-
Ing has made thousands of permanent
cures. "-"Â¦â¢'
Many pile sufferers who have undergone
surgical operations without relief or. cure
have, been surprised by results from a
few weeks' treatment with the Pyramid
suppository.
The relief from pain is so Immediate
that patients sometimes imagine that the
Pyramid contains opiates or cocaine, but
such ls not the case; It is guaranteed ab-
solutely free from any injurious drug.
The cure is the result of the healing oils
and astringent properties of the remedy,
which cause the little tumors and con-
jested blood vessels to contract and a
natural circulation is established..
All druggists sell the Pyramid Pile Care
at 60 cents for full slxed package. .

THE up-to-date young man, when
he wishes to make a hit with the
fair sex, sends to the girl he loves
"a bird in a gilded cage" by a
messenger boy, charges paid. Alf
Ellinghouse, the theatrical manager, sent
Miss Alice Nielsen a bird that had to be
hauled in an express wagon and the cage
was made of lumber two inches thick.
A few days ago two lads employed by
the Alhambra to "stick up snipes" in the
interest of the theater were rudely dis
turbed in their labors at Tenth and Mar
ket streets by an eagle quietly dropping
from the clouds and alighting on the side
walk close to where they were working.
They threw a blanket over the "king of
birds" and brought it down to the Al
hambra and placed It in the back yard.
Then Elllnghouse's troubles began. The
bird would eat j nothing but fine. . juicy
steaks, which were procured at Delmon
ico's. When anybody approached the
eagle It would open its wings and make a
rush at the Inquisitive spectator. The bird
was so strong that the chair that it was
tied to was hauled around the yard as if
It was a mere watch charm, placed on Ha
leg for ornament. A large wooden cage
waa made and the bird was placed In
durance vile.
George Bowles, the manager for Alice
Nielsen and a warm friend of Ellinghouse.
dropped in to see the bird. He said Miss
Nielsen had often expressed a wish for
an eagle. Alf Ellinghouse made a terrible
bluff that he hated to lose the bird,
"warm attachment." "Hermann wanted
to buy it for $500, to turn it into a flock
of geese at every* performance." etc., but
âIf Miss Nielsen would accept the eagle
as a token of his admiration, he would
make her a present of the bird.
The offer was accepted and arrange
ments were at once made to move the bird
down to the stage of the Columbia Thea
ter. Ellinghouse excused himself for not
tying a ribbon around the neck of the
bird, but explained that he was sure a
child three years old could do so, the
eagle waa so gentle.
The cage, eagie and two pounds of beef
steak were placed In a wagon and the
procession to the new home of the eagle
was formed. Arriving at the theater, a
chain was placed around the bird's leg
and he was released from the cage. One
of the stage mechanics had a bull terrier
pup running around the stage. The pup
attempted to mix with the eagle and went
down and out In the first round.
George Bowles wants the eagle put In

Widow and Friends of the "Unfortu

the Motive for His
Act.
- Â¦ ' Â¦':'- :
Oakland Office San Francesco Call,
1118 Broadway, Dec. 1.
Fearful that Ions Illness was destroying
his reason, Henry C. Perry, a civil en
gineer residing in Berkeley, committed
suicide last night by inhaling gas in a
room at 5G5 Eleventh street.
His plans for suicide were made with
much deliberation. Perry rented a small
back room at the place yesterday after
noon. Last evening he spent several
hours with his wife at , their home on
Ashby avenue, where his last act was to
arrange a lengthy list of his possessions.
For several hours they went over their
affairs. Perry requesting his wife's as
sistance, saying he wanted to seÂ« where
his finances stood, as he had not examined
them for some time. During the conver
sation, Perry gave no evidence of his con
templated death. His mind was upon the
subject, for once he said to his wife,
â¢'What would you do. dear, without me?"
Mrs. Perry observed nothing to arouse
her suspicions. Her husband's conduct
had of late been somewhat erratic so she
â¢did not deem it strange when he sudden
ly declared he was going out for a walk,
and that his wife should retire and not
wait for his . return. \
The engineer went at once to the lodg
ing-house and prepared for death. First
he moved the bed directly "under a gas
burner in the room. Then he turned on
the key and-knelt by the side of the bed.
Perry's body was found in that position
when the room was broken open i this
morning by other roomers, who had de
tected the odor of escaping gas and had
traced it to the dead man's apartments
Mrs. Perry became alarmed at midnight
because of her husband's failure to re
turn. She summoned her brother-in-law,
Charles H. Spear, and an all-night search
waÂ» commenced In this city. Berkeley and
San Francisco for the missing man. It
ended when the Morgue officials were
notified of the suicide. Spear went at once
to the Coroner's office, where the body
had been taken, and identified it.
Perry was a graduate of the University
of California, class of 1S83. He had at
tained considerable distinction in his pro
fession. For ten years he held an Impor
tant position in Hawaii with the Hawai
ian Commercial Company. About ten
months ago he returned from the Islands,
much broken In health and Buffering from
extreme nervous debility. Becoming Im
bued with the idea that his mind was af
fected. Perry consulted several experts
on mental diseases. Including Dr. Hirsch
felder of San Francisco and Dr. Gardner
of the Napa State Hospital. Their assur
ances that he needed only rest and treat
ment for nervous trouble appeared not to
satisfy the ailing engineer. Less than a
week ago he visited Dr. Gardner at Napa.
His relatives and friends are thoroughly
satisfied now that Perry's long brooding
about his condition led him to believe he
would become a maniac, therefore he end
ed his life.
The deceased engineer was a native of
California, 42 years of age. His wife and
two children survive him.

said,' "as Â¦ the .Pacific . Mail waa not -_ dis
posed | to renew its contract with us, and
there are i no <Â¦ other -American: companies
from , which :i we ; could get ? satisfactory
transportation*" >'
One advantage such \ a combination
would have over the Panama would be
more prompt delivery, it is, claimed. i The
combined companies will.be able to run
steamships into Guaymas, on the Gulf of
California, and there transfer freight â¢ to
the Sonora Railroad , which ls : controlled
by the Southern Pacific. ., From this line
the freight would be sent over, the South
ern Pacific to Galveston," whence it would
be taken to New York by the Morgan
line. 'Â¦-'Â¦Â¦''Â¦ "Â¦ Â¦ *'â¢- -. :r " Â¦ Â¦ Â¦'-. Â¦: .
P. F. Connor, the Panama company's
local agent, admitted yesterday that his
company was not chartering steamers be
cause It wanted to, although he preferred
that an official â¢ announcement to that ef
fect should come from the New York
office.
â¢Why the Pacific Mail has so stoutly de
clined to extend its contract with the Pan
ama people after December IS is a ques
tion which seems to be open to more than
one explanation. The action of the Pa
cific Mail, coming as it does so soon after
the Southern Pacific secured a controlling
interest in the company, has led many
to believe that by a combination which
will now be possible between the railroad
and the steamboat companies, the stock
holders hope to eventually freeze out the
Panama company on this coast.
If the Panama company was able to
contract with any other steamship com
pany for handling Its coastwise business
It. would do so, but in its failure to ar
range such a contract leaves it in a posi
tion where It must charter its own
steamers. To " this end the company is
now working, and a second steamer was
chartered yesterday through the Panama
company's Pacific Coast agent, F. F.*Con
nor. The name of the vessel is not given,
but it is said to be one of two that have
been under option for several days.
The reason- why the Panama company
has been unable to get any other steam
ship line to handle Its Pacific Coast busi
ness is not due to the scarcity of foreign
companies which would like to succeed
the Paclllc Mail. The trouble lies in the
fact that the United States law will not
permit the handling of coastwise trade
except in American bottoms.
' From reliable sources It was learned
yesterday that the Panama Railroad
Company/is not at all anxious to put on
an independent steamship service between
this city and Panama, but is compelled
to do so by the action of the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company in peremptorily re
fusing to enter into another contract with
the Panama people. It is asserted that
the Panama company has been and still
Is willing to accept almost any terms the
Pacific Mail is willing to allow it. It ls
further claimed that the Panama Rail
road has not refused to give the Pacific
Mail the exclusive right to carry the
freight passing over the isthmus.
The Railro .d Company Is
Refused Renewal of Its
Contract.

A coming dramatic recital that is at
tracting an unusual amount of attention
is the third and last In the series given by
Mrs. Louise Humphrey-Smith, which will
take place at Century Hall next Thursday
evening-, i Mrs. -Smith has for her subject
Stephen Phillips' "Paolo and Francesca,"
the tragedy which has attracted such at
tention equally from literati and play
wrights, and the reciter's well-known
ability insures a thoughtful and clever in
terpretation of this most beautiful of mod
ern plays. Â¦
Mr. Stern owns one of the moet beauti
ful Stradivarius celli ever turned out by
the old 'Cremonese genius.* The instru
ment has a jpicturetque and romantio his
tory. Its first owner, fully conscious of
the beauty. and worth of Stradivarius'
work, handled it with extremest care dur
ing his lifetime and then left it with
scrupulous charge concerning its welfare
to his heirs. In their keeping, in thÂ© isl
and of Corfu, the cello lay untouched for
a lull hundred yeara, and finally, by a
Joint gift from admiring friends, has
reached the hands of this distinguished
young artist in perfect condition. Mr.
Stern is a pupil of the celebrated PiattJ,
and has done much In the first introduc
tion of the later claseics for the cello of
Tschaikowsky and Dvorak and others Into
American concert rooms. . Ha has also a
sufficient knowledge of the piano and
plays much for his talented .wire.
Campanari, whobe excellent barytone
has given such pleasure here, is, also, a
cellist of note, and also plays very well
on the piano. Mr. 1 Stern 'accompanies his
cello work, then Campanart wiu'play for
him. There is talent to burn among the
Grau people. '
They tell many stories of the barytone
cellist-pianist Campanarl; of his large in
difference to his physical surroundings,
for one thing. He was asked If hs had
been to see Chinatown here, but replied
that he did not see why he should, as hÂ»
could Â£et the photographs for 50 cents!
There has been some gtjssip to the effect
that Mr. Campanari's brother, a distin
guished and well known conductor both
in London and Milan, may possibly corr.e
out here for a short season In the oear
future. Â¦ ( .
Local music, with the ending of the
opera season, is beginning to look up
again. A Schumann piano recital by Wil
liam Piutti at Century Club Hall on the
afternoon of December C and another ap
pearance of little Paloma - Schramm on
Tuesday evening under tho auspices of
the Loyal Rebekah Lodge, I..O. 0. F. t will
be the week's programme.
In the Grau company are many singers
who have made no appearances at all
nÂ«ie, .Pini-Corsi among mem, and others
who have had only smallest opportunity
of showing tnelr capabilities. Suzanne
Adams, who sings to-night in "Rigoletto,'.'
is an artist wnoae measure we of tne West
lia\e hardly had a chance to take, her
only appearance so far being as Margue
rite de VaJois in "The Huguenots." jtliss
Adams is not the only Qisunguished mem
ber of her family, by the way. Her-hus
oand, Leo Stern, ls a cellist of wide repu
tation. Ho is here with Mrs. Stern for tho
season, and in other places included in the
Grau itinerary wili make a public appear
ance. At. St. Louis he plays with tho
symphony orchestra, and it seems a pity
that here in San Francisco we- should not
have had opportunity of hearing him and
thÂ© famous "General Kydd" cello which
the arti3t ls fortunate enough to possess.
the natural musical progress s to be ex
pected with the years and from Wagner's
comparative novelty. The . 'Ring' appre
ciation is'jperhaps surprising from its dif
ficulty of comprehension on first hearing."
"How does tho occasional adverse criti
cism of your Western critics suikc you?"
"Every man has a right to his opinion,"
and Mr. Grau here smiled a little, as if
there were in, reserve some opinions con
cerning opinions. "But all I ask is sin
cerity. If San Francisco is, on the whole,
a6 well pleased - with us as we are with
San Franciscoâ and from. the few people
I see I gather that she lsâ there is little
to complain of on either side."
"We had hoped to hear 'Tristan 1 and
the "Meisterslngers* this time."
"You will prouably have those and other
things next time," and Mr. Grau, with an
interested glance at his - correspondence
and another at tho sunlight flooding thÂ©
room, commented again on the "beautiful
day." '
"Can you not say as to time of the next
visit?" I asked. "Septemberâ October?"
"Too early, I think," he replied. "You
may most likely expect us about the same
time next year." And I, with a saving
remembrance of the appealing correspond
ence, took my leaae. â¢ â¢
"No. I have not been here since the last
Pattl visit. In '93, and nothing of- the kind
was then in evidence. It was simply from
"Delightful day!" he said next, looking
toward the windows through which the
sun was pouring In its warm November
brilliance, and wishing, evidently, that
with his singers he could carry back to
New York some of the sunshine which
had made possible the uninterrupted pro
gramme of San Francisco's season. He
was sitting at a small, plain writing-table
in his rooms at the Palace Hotel, talking
to tlje incessant tick-tick of a typewriter
In the next apartment, and with a divided
attention for the scattered teiegrams, un
opened letters, and correspondence of all
kinds, with which the table was adorned.
In turning over these, a playbill v.'ith th^
famous names of Calve and "Carmen," in
conjunction, was disclosed, and immedi
ately suggested inquiry as to the rumored
Calve engagement of next year, and her
romantic pilgrimage to India in search of
health.
"It is true," said Mr. Grau, "that Calve
does not sing this year, also that when I
left her in Paris immediately before com
ing here she was contemplating a pleasure
trip to Egypt. As to anything- further â
Eastern pilgrimages and the. like â I know
nothing. But in all human probability
Calve will be with us next year and give
you that Carmen whichâ well, I think you
will like it." Which, from the emphatical
ly unenthusIastIc*Mr. Grau, means an un
limited much. -
"We have had a Carmen hereâCollama
rini." I suggested. <
"Yes, I was at your little opera-house
the first evening of my arrival," discreet
ly replied Mr. Grau.
"We liked her," I ventured again.
"Yes?"
"And we think that, musically. San
Francisco owes, much to the little Tivoll."
"I do not think that you can get a per
formance of equal value for the prices
anywhere." heartily rejoined the impre
sario. "And their unbroken programme of
twenty-three â twenty-four "
"Twenty-one Â¦ years." I corrected.
" is almost unique." he continued.
"Yes, we have been round there quite fre
quently."
"Were you surprised at the Wagnerian
enthusiasm here. Mr. Grau?"
"Hardly â no. We expected It." '
"From former experiences?"
"One remarkable feature of the season
so farâ but I must not boast, there ls still
half a week leftâ is that in a series of
twenty-four performances we have only
once had to change the programme, and
that only in one slight, particular. A most
unusual record!" and Mr. Grau sighed aa
if he might have troubles of his own. with
amusing evidence of memories of sneezing:
Brunnhildes, sulky Juliets, rebellious Lu
cias, and the prima donna in ail her fas
cinating, capricious variety.
"Yes, it is a great pleasure to be able
to grive such performances," he said the
other day, "and pleasant also, to feel that
the effort is appreciated in the hearty
fashion in which San Francisco has ap
parently enjoyed our work.
Mr. Grau expresses a considerable con
tentment with his reception out West,
without any surprise, however,, at its
warmth, and with a pardonable sense of
its being the well-earned result of effort
expended in his production?.
Â¦ artists of the com
ing season, the repertoire â of course, de
pendent upon the artists â Mr. Grau is yet
unable to give any definite information,
but the famous impresario gave me a few
notes of interest the other day as to prob
abilities. ,

rtal knowledge I had ever received that could
convince me that rupture was a curable mal-
ady. I used the home treatment and am glad
to say that my rupture waa perfectly cured

si.y difference between the healed place and
any other solid part of me. I was cured sound

CHICAGO, Dec. 1.â "Wheat formed a dull
market of the variety known as "changing,"
which Is to say that traders were- getting out
of their December deals Into later ones. Jan
uary opened a shade higher at 70%c and sold
early at 70TÂ»c There was no particular de
mand, but offerings were light because of fair
ly steady cables and light deliveries on De
cember contracts. Between 400,000 and 500,000
bushels were put on early, The belief that the
December liquidation had about exhausted
itself also tended to hold prices. Later, how
ever, the liberal receipts, the speculative dull
ness and a bit of fag-end liquidation sent Jan
uary down to 70%c. At this point the market
steadied on the New York report of 53 loads
taken for export and the close was only %a
down at 70%Â©70Ue.
Corn was fairly active and higher early, but
dull and lower later. Miy closed unchanged.
Oats were quiet and easy. May closed HS 1
Uc lower.-
Provisions were firm early In deliveries, only
1760 tierces of lard and talk of a lard corner
by the Cudahy Brothers, who continue to buy
December and sell January. Later, however,
prices eased oft. The clorc was fairly steady.
January pork closed unchanged, 2'4Â®Sc down,
and ribs 5c depressed.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

The Lumber Trade.
rariflc Coa*! Wood and Iron says of lumber
.â¢â¢The 'lumber trade circles of this State have
bwn enjoying a. rather encouraging range of
trade activity during the thirty days Just
cir>sÂ«-d. and every Indication points toward a
c^ntlr.uation during the last month of this
prosperous year. The redwood mills have been
tiary with orders, t>oth domestic and foreign.
>.hUe the local oast order? have not been lack
ing. The prices have not been as larga as they
enimld fr*. but tn* fault lies at the door of the
ru.nufartupers themselves ar.d no other in
fluence Is to blame. However, with a little
more co-operation among the interests, there
*hcu!u be a return to better quotations for red
xs-o.nl, when the manufacturers and retailers
Â»'i!l then bar* no cause for complaint.
Â¦ 'The mountain mills in the cugar and white
p<ne belt are. with pome few exceptions, ready
f> conclude their peaaon'e run. The latter has
bÂ«en one of Use most, if not the most, success
ful year* In the history of these mills, and the
< wners tiave reason to be proud of the record
i*A* in 1KÂ». Orders have been actually turned
?.ir*n bt several mills cr have been shifted to
ot.ber plants, -while the current prices have
% *en erseouraginit. The Eastern demands have
â¢Y#*n heavy and the range of demand has been
moft exteni-ive. reaching even as far east and
north as Maine snrt. running down into the
Southern State* of this country. Oanarta has
also nip.;- heÂ»vy calls on the mountain mlllB
for sugar pine and their trade calls are ex
tending all over the country.
â¢Â¦The redwood shingle is making Its way with
encouraging result* into the Eastern States.
Weather Report.
bank statement and with the additional in
fluence of. a three-point break In Sugar. The
principal demand for railroad stocks looked
to shares of companies operating In the South
ern â¢ region. Chesapeake and Ohio and the
Southern railway stocks were taken In large
blocks and Mobile and Ohio was moved upward
S4 points out of a dormant statf. Sugar was
heavy throughout on doubts regarding the ap
proaching , dividend, vrhich rumor has pro
claimed would be Increased.- Reports current
of a projected new refinery near New York
had a marked effect on the etock and helped
to break the price In the final dealings. Peo
ple's Gas, Glucose, Smelting and Anaconda
also weakened early In the trading. American
Tobacco showed a strong recovery from recent
depresslen and the coalers had a rise because
of the cold weather. The bank statement was
a eurprise. The heavy loan expansion is sup
poeed to be due largely to preparations for re
quirements for December, but the usual De
cember preparations for January are expected
to become effective soon and the revival of
the Interior demand for currency toward the
last of the week suggests caution in the bor
rowing of money for speculation. The gain
in cash of Jl.84i.300 was unexpected and served
as a .wholeeome offset to the increase In re
serve requirements of t3.254.900 growing out of
the large addition of $11,778,000 to deposits.
The Inroads of tl. 412,000 upon the surplus
would otherwise have been much larger. The
continued large demand for bonds at advanc
ing prices was a noticeable feature of the
trade. The trading in stocks has been on a
diminishing scale this week. No change in
financial or business conditions can be assigned
as the caus; of this lessened speculation. It ts
the natural cause bound to come after an 6ut
burst of great activity In human affairs. The
same thing is seen in the business of the
country, where buying was excessive Immedi
ately after flection, representing the loosening
of floods pent up pending the decision of that
event, while now the animated demand for
products shows some natural reaction. This
is especially noticeable in the iron trade. The
stock market Is espertally sensitive to the
coutre of events In that trade. The purely
speculative element has been quick to take
profits and prices have consequently declined.
This survey of the stock market conditions
must, however, be taken in a purely relative
eense. While business is smaller and prices
are lowtr than In th* period Immediately pre
ceding, there U still a high level of prlees
maintained and capital continues to be em
ployed on an enormous scale in securities. It
has happened many times that the transactions
la some one stock will show sales of 100.000
chares for a tingle day's business and tbe
record haÂ« run up to over 200,000 ehares for a
single day's business In Northern Pacific. It
is not conceivable that unformed speculative
enthusiasm of the general public should Â§.how
euch results a.Â« this. Great combinations and
syndicates of bankers and capitalists alone
could command the resources for dealing on
such a scale when the execution of buying
orders brings our records of many thousands
of shares changing hands In blocks. Nelthet
!s it within the bounds of probability to sup
pos: that such buying Is held on a margin,
with the mere purpose of marketing the shares
at a higher level of prices. Some have gone
into the vaults of financial Institutions to be
held for the nake of the Investment return
afforded, while others have gone into the hands
of competing or affiliated companies to secure
control cr increased Influence. No authoritative
announcements have been . made as to the
source of any of this buying, though rumor
has been busy with reports of "deals" and
combinations. These rumors are so indefinite
and sometimes Â«o contrary as to stamp them as
unreliable, but the conviction Is very general
in Wall street that a process is going on of
transfusion of Interest among the great rail
road systems of the country wherever there if
competition or wherever there Is a mutual In
terest making a common Influence desirable.
The series of operatic nÂ» recently reflected by
the Pennsylvania and New York Central are.
the obvious motive for. such transactions. The
problems of competition and of diversion of
profits which thus tend toward solution are
calculated to increase of value. of investments
In the properties Involved, while from the
technical stock market standpoint the reJuc
tion of the floating supply of securities Is cal
culated to add Indefinitely to the stability of
market prices. â¢
The bond market has been less unst-ttled
this week than stork*. Business has increased
and prices have advanced. Junior or refund
ing and organization bonds have been the fa
vorites, especially new Issues.
I'nited States refunding 2s advanced 4, the
old 4s and ."s iÂ£ and the 3s and new 4b 4
per cent over the call prices of a week ago.

Weekly Bank Statement.
NEW YORK. Dec. Lâ The reserve require
ments of the New York clearing-house banks
were Increased over $3,250,000 last week through
a heavy addition of $13,010,600 to the deposit
totel and this explains why, despite a gain In
cash holdings of $1,842,300 the surplus reserve
fell off $1,412,500. The expansion in deposits
was caused almost wholly by the Increase of
111.778,000 in loans, the latter factor proving
the moct significant feature of the week. It has
npt escaped attention that the loans of- the
banks since election time have not responded
to the heavy volume of buelnees noted in every
direction. This has caused a great deal of dis
cussion and much theorizing, but as a matter
of fact the banks are now beginning to show
in a belated manner the drains made upon
them. The gains In loans lost week was the
heaviest noted in months, the closing week in
July having exceeded it slightly. The current
statement is better than anticipated, as It has
been figured that the banks have lost an
amount in cash lareer than the actual, total
revealed. The clearing-houce institutions In
their operations with the sub-treasury Â¦ here
were debtors to a large extent and the interior
made unexpected heavy drafts for funds. Nev
ertheless the excess reserve - stands at nearly
$11.COO,GOO and as the season is at hand when the
natural trend of money is In this direction
fears for the future have been abated. Â¦ An
analysis of the Individual bank reports for the
week, however, show that the changes have
been confined to a few large banks, and these
institutions hold the greater part of the carh
increases noted. The circulation item is being:
watched rather closely In financial circles, more
hf a matter of curiosity to observe the working*
of the new law than with the idea that the
changes will .affect the situation. The banks
reem to have attained maximum circulation
figures at present and slight decreases are the
rule from week to week. The present volume
of circulation reached by the New York banks
Is $30,670,000. It will require a rather power
ful Incentive to mart 'an upward movement.
The circulation is less than half that permitted
by law. There Is reserve power in this fact,
but official* do not apprehend any condition
that will lead to a general effort to Increase
present flcures.

sociated banks for rive days shows:

"La Traviata" Fails to Draw a Crowd
; at the Matineeâ "Kigroletto"
Will Close the Grau
Season.
To-night the last programme of the
season â and a very good one â "Rigoletto "
will be put on. with Suzanne Adams, of
whom we have heard bv no means
enough: Saleza, Louise Homer (as Mad
oalena} and M. Scotti, in one of his beÂ«t
roles, as Rigoletto.
Mr. Blass was a satisfying f^einrich, he
having a rood, round, full bass, and Mr.
Dufriche. the herald, exhibited his rag
time tremolo to utmost advantage in the
herald role. It is too bad, that vibrato,
for the voice Is most pieasing- in duality
The enthusiasm all through was most
marked, and the choruses and orchestra
Ciine In for a large share of the appre
ciation, not to mention the "man at the
wheel," Damrosch.
Oh, but we missed our Blspham, in
spite of the fact that Muhlmann's Telra
mur.d was good, only in comparison with
the superb picture of the part that Mr.
Bispham paints for us. But Muhlmaan's
Telramund was exceedingly well sung,
though quite without tne vital depth that
tells the story Â£ven in its tone, which Mr.
Blspham has in so high degree.
In tho acting, too, the part lacked the
vivid touch of the first Telramund, and
one is beginning, in evening up the sea
son's accounts, to find that Bispham is
one of its most brilliant figures â one of
its highest lights.
Gadskt repeated her previous success as
Elsa, though her voice had hardly the
fine freshness of the opera's first hearing.
And Schumann-Heink, the glorious con
tralto, even she â from four nights of
Wagrner, the insatiate â had a little tired
ncte in her gorgeous voice. But she Is a
tremendous figure, none greater in the
whole Grau company, and the sense q{ It
grows upon one with each further hear
ing of the satisfying creature.
Mr. Van Dyck again sang the "Lohen
grin," and him, too. I have heard in bet
ter form. But he has so intimately the
broad Wagner note, the large, placid dig
nity of the role, that his work is always
distinguished.
The night's "Lohengrin," an outside-of
the-subscription performance, was attend
ed by another of the season's big crowds,
which signified its pleasure in the render
ing with a heartiness which has grown
to be the recognized atmosphere of all
but the Wagnerian evenings.
MancineLi conducted with his usual
masterly ease, thorough, quiet grip of
every available orchestral resource, and
his wonderful sympathy with every shade
of the singer's tonal shading and rhyth
mic values.
Crcmonial, the Aliredo of the afternoon,
has been in liner voice, too, but he is the
sweetly sentimental hero or Italian opera
from the crown of his Byronic wig to the
toes of his velvet shoes. Campanari sings
a manly, sufficient Germont. He is a
thoroughly reliable artisk The rest o-f
the work is well undertaken by Mme.
Van Cauteren, Mile. Bauermeister, Ma
siero. Bars, Dufrlche and Giilibert.
Meiba Â¦was not in an inspired mood for
one thing, but what an infinite satisfac
tion it is every time she opens her moutn,
with or without tne inspiration erf a dra
matic sympathy with her rolei She plays
the part rather as if she despised it, in
a perfunctory, haif-hearted fashion, only
waking up to the sentimental tragedy of
the conception in spots.
Still, comparison is not criticism, but
the juxtaposition of the two operas was
too obviously singular to pass without
noto. To the larger proportion of tne not
l^rfe'e audience me comparison was ptr
naps not possible, but that tng. opera is
not in h:gu tavor even on its own merits
was apparent enough from the many
empty seats and the lack of the heart-to
heart element In the appiause.
It gees hardly with most things that
come between numbers in a .Wagner
week. a.nd yesterday afternoon the trim
little "Traviata" fared ill indeed from its
conjunction with "i-iOherigrin" and "Got
terda.cmmerung." "La Travjata," with its
ingenious trills, roulades and simple har
monics, eauie with an absurd effect of
antl-ciimax after "Die ciotterdaernmcr
uag," to music what "Paradise Lost" is>
to i.ierature, a colossal epic.
We have had a Wagner week of it with
the Grau people at the Grand Opera
house, the four-night "Ring" to begin
with and "Lohengrin" last night with
which to top off the programme.

The aftermath 6t the big gridiron game
of Thursday has brought to light many in
teresting details that were clouflod from
general view. During the first half Cali
fornia's fierce assaults by Captain PTjnfle,
Warren. Smith and Gammon forced the
ball dangerously near the cardinal goal.
It was not done by the easy, effective,
well executed jabbing through the liw, as
in tho game of a year ago, but only by
the dash, strength and determination of
individuals, team play not being much of
an element. Now and then Stanford
braced up and the mix-up became one of
intense man-to-man, strugle. The first time
Berkeley came â¢within the shadow of the
Palo Alto goal posts Captain Burnett of
fered to bet Captain Pringle anything
from $25 in money to after season suppers
for the crowd that California couldn't put
the ball over the cardinal goal line. Piay
stopped an instant while the men ban
tered. The effect of the remark was,
seemingly, to fill the men who were being
rushed down the field with ginger enough
to stop Berkeley short and win the ball."
After that incident, the Stanford men
say, they never once feared that their
goal line would be crossed.
One play of the game was tinged, with
a possibility which, had the on-rushing
cardinal halfback and end, "Pie" Smith
and Tom McFadden, realized, might have
developed into an incident similar to that
which won the game for Stanford. in 1594.
In that game Charley Flckert blocked a
punt from the foot of Ransome, who with
Cochran, the Stanford tackle, rushed at
the ball. The simultaneous bounds of the
players at the ball caused it to be knocked
about fifteen yards down the field toward
the blue and (fold goal. Cochran reached '

weakness by shouting from the side line
almost any statement of a loud nature
even general, in terms of admonition, is
discountenanced. Umpire Hoagland sent
Stanford back five yards when a cardinal

make it nvo yards .more." Hoagland la
conically remarked, "That will cost you
rellows five." It is the consensus of opin
ion that both Hoogland and Referee Good
win were fair and efficient officials in
every respect.
The player who was worst injured dur
ing the game was "Stub" Raitt, the Stan
ford quarter. Coming from a bereaved
home back to college last Saturday, the
plucky little fellow on being removed
from the game when a bad fall had
stunned him, let nervous reaction take
sway end wept bitterly in the arms of two
brother players. Â»"-,-Â¦ Â¦
â¢There will be no game with the Colum
bia team, and Harvard, Yale or Princeton
it first, the ball lying "dead" after the
roll. Such was the case in Thursday's
game. Smith was ahead of all the play
ers after Tommy MeFadden had blocked
More's drop kick, with a free field in front
of him. In the Â«rame of '94 under the con
ditions stated Cochran kicked the ball
about thirty yards over the line, fell on It
himself, scored a touchdown and won the
game for Stanford. In this game of 1900
Smith could have come very near doing
the same thing. It is detracting nothing
from his football ability that he did not.
The incident was one, however, wherein
the football maxim "Always drop on the
pall, don't try to pick it up.", might have
been very advantageously disregarded.
Iwice during tho game of Thursday the
Stanford team lost ground under penalties
inflicted for '. side-line coaching. This
coaching, contrary to popular idea, need
net necessarily be a carefully planned pol
icy. To let your side know the other side's
