On the fth of June the missionaries,

refuge In the Methodist Mission in Peking.
On the 20th the murder of Baron von
Ketteler, the German Em^assador. caused
them to lose all faith In the Chinese Gov

that date they hurried, together with the
members of the European colonies, to that

mained until the arrival of the long

of Wednesday/ August .15. ';.. V .-. - . .
On that day the Rev. C, H. 3*enn.! a
Presbyterian missionary, who was one of
yesterday's arrivals on the Coptic, was
taking photographs . in the compouad of

before dusk . the American.- column and a'

rived at the legation. \V .
V According to all "tie stories told by the
refugees the relief came none ; t6o- quick.'
Soon after the siege befjah It was found
necessary to appoint a food supply com
mittee to collect rations and see to thejf
proper distribution. To perform this duty
the following named . were selected-; Rev:

decided to offer the striking miners of the

up with their employes any* grievances
which they may have. Powder will be

HANNA TAXKS OF THE STRIKE:
These horse actors seen In "Ben Hur"
are among the star horses of the stage.
There are twelve of them in all â eight in
the race scene each night and four under
studies held in readiness for any possible
breakdown. But the substitutes get very
few chances. The stars are too fond of
their nightly sport In the light and thÂ©
darkness.. They have sniffed the Incense
of public applause and the: glamour of the
footlights is upon them.. : ....
Horse, actors are an important part of
the modern play. There are about 15i)
actively employed In plays . now touring,
t he Â¦ country; The season's . further ad
vancement, will. .bring out many more de- :
biita rites from the dramatic school for
horses and, graduates; of the circus ring.
The automobile; may be driving the horsd
from, the 'front 'of. cabs an<l::wagon3i but.
It Is placing, hint in the higher walks. The
horse actor has made a hit with the pub
lic' He add.-* that: touch of realism that
perfects the .modern, slase portrayal of â¢
Â¦life. In- tact, he touches the hearts of .
some; auditors 'where; merei humans fail.

horses: Â¦Â¦:Â¦ â¢.â¢..".'â¢Â¦" ;; ".' Â¦':Â¦>".: , : Â¦"Â¦Â¦Â¦' :'^ : / Â¦Â¦Â¦:':..'Â¦Â¦ \ Â¦Â¦

East-.- Twenty- fifth street, convenient ! to
the theater district: lie re all the notable
horse actors, haye been taught and have
been graduated with honor;. Many ..of
th<Â»m live Â¦ there- when.' not on. the road.
"With one success.- the stage horse make*
hlsy contract with tbe drama. . He t*
henceforth an actor and does no other
we rk; except .in. :hlÂ»^chosen-, profession."
' The average -salary of a horse actor
ranges from; $15 to $20 'a week. The ani
mals are paid for according to the work
thry are called; upon to perform. The
stars get $25 and $30. .':,-. :
Drs. Martin Potter and S. 9. Fields are
the owners and Instructor* of the dra
matic school for horses. They pick out
their subjects for the stage as carefully
as a manager selects his chorus. Tha
horse must be good looking, well bred,
intelligent and good tempered. He must
have temperament. These requirements
are absolutely essential in the horse actm*
as a foundation. He may be tauunt to
personate a vicious horse or made up to
look like a mean, half-starved animal, bur
In private life he must be a good horse.
Certain facial characteristics indicate
the clever equine actor, such. Â«s breadth
between the eyes, which must be soft, full
and intelligent. The forehead must b*
flat as well as broad. The Roman-nosed
horse has no place on the stage. They drÂ»
not even attempt to teach him the rudi
ments of the art.
The training of these horse pupils be
gins with a certain sort of Delsartean
study. Grace In moving and turning, car
riage of the head, easy handling of the
feet, are among the primer lessons.
Then follows the class In stage business.
Cues, pretty tricks of the eyea. tossing
the head, pawing" delicately in stage grass
and rocks, jumping and other feats aro
jrradunlly acquired as accomplishments,
and the dramatic horse passes into a
higher grade. The advanced studies in
clude familiarity with stage effects,
noises, thunder, firearms, the smell of
smoke, the ringing of bells, moving of
scenery and falling of drops. All these
are elements In the education of the horse
actor.
Fire is the last stage of the course. Th<Â»
horse- is surrounded with blazing effects.
Flamir.g newspapers are flashed in his
*yes and about his legs and body until he
learns that It may come near without
harming him. He Is gradually weaned
from the horse's natural. Inborn fear of
flre. With blanketed head he is rushed
through flame and smoke. It is only when
these branches are . mastered that the
horse is numbered among the stars. V
Rarely do these horses of the stagÂ© be
have badly. A story Is told of one roman
tic actor who had a scene in which hÂ»
pleided with his sweetheart to elope. The
stare was set as the mjrnlnsr room of an
old country house wlti a terrace and a
road back. The girl was young and timid,
the lover ardent and daring. He remarked
to her that hi* horse was at the door, and
that unless she corsented to run away
with him then and there he would ride
.iway forever, nevsr to return. He got
mixed In his cues, and the horse, wh.ch
was to have been led on at the back, sud
denly walked In-o the room, apparently
through the waV Â»Â» though wishing to
express his entl--e sympathy with tha af
f.iir and his willnjrness to participate in
any plans for *ri elopement.
Frequently ;he horse actor â¢â¢doubles."
for tbe reason thatjhe Is an expensive
luxury in sta/^ Hfe. This doubling Is done
usually by Â»ieans of a change of saddles
and trappiTffs or in tho costume of thÂ«
rider.
In full swing on the other sldÂ« of the cur
tain, these horses are as calm and as
quiet, now that their work ia done, as If.
tney were In their stalls.
"That dust is simply lovely," said Nel
lie, sniffing and tossing her head.
"They were a trifle late with the light
that last time," said Ned. yawning. "I
hate thoso recalls." Â¦ ... , :
Calmly, decorously, quietly these won
derful horse actors step off the center of
the stage and pass out of the back door
of the scenes. Not a tremor, not a parti
cle of fear agitates them; not even a loud
footfall betrays any excitement despite
the darkness, the sudden lights, the lash-
Ing whips and the shouts. It is a wonder
ful exposition of horse intelligence. Not
the intelligence of the trained trick horse
but dramatic talent developed in thesÂ©
animals until they have acquired a fond
ness for their work and a pride in it.

armor amounts to about 36,000 tons for

recommended by the Government. When
the iiret bids were opened it was found
that the Carnegie and Bethlehem com

each bidding the same price. $443 for class
A armor ..and $45 added for royalty. The
MIdvale Steel Company's bid was $433 per

the condition that considerable time be

an increase of ten per cent in wages and

the chief subject of debate and next came
the recognition of the union. So far as
can be learned none of the operators
were in favor of recognizing the union
in any way.

WILL NOT ACCEPT TERMS.
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. IIâ The mine
owners of the Wyoming. Lacka
wanna and Ohio regions to-day at
a meeting at Wilkesbarre followed
yesterday's' action of the Reading
Company in giving 10 per cent increase in
wages. The company decided to reduce
the price of powder from $2 75 to $1 50 per
keg. The latter price has prevailed at the
Reading Company's mines for a long time.
The action of the Wilkesbarre meeting
means an increase of 10 per cent to a'l
mine workers except miners. The latter
will earn an Increase of about 10 per cent
by reason of the reduced price of powder.
The meeting was attended by represent
atives of all the railroad companies which
own mines in. the region named.- Some of
the Independent miners oppose this pro
posed increase unless the coal. carriers re
duce the tolls on their product to tide
water.
The strikers show no indication of ac
cepting the offer. None returned to work
to-day at the Reading Company's collier
ies; in response to the notice of higher
wages, and, in fact, many who had been
at work there quit and joined the ranks
of the strikers. As a result there were
fewer collieries in operation to-day in the
Schuylkill region than at any time since
the strike began. In the other regions
there were 'also additions to the strikers'
forces.; :.Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦ ' â¢ . .Â¦'..Â¦
Notices of the Increase In pay. were
posted throughout the entire anthracite
region to-night, but the opinion is general,
that few if any of the strikers will return
to work. The strikers say they have other
grievances to be adjusted besides- wages
and powder charges, and they further., 6ay
they want recognition of their union. , -

viewed upon the subject, although I do
not at present remember to whom it was
given. I did not at first look with favor
upon the proposition to sell beer to sol
diers at army canteens. -That opinion was
not based on personal observation, as I
had not been stationed at a military post
since the canteen was established. Owing
to the general consensus of opinion
among line and . medical officers of the
army who have had- ample -opportunity
to observe the effect of the army canteen
upon the habits of our soldiers. I am
obliged to admit that, from a practical
point of view, it seems to. have accom
plished very desirable results In reducing
the amount of drunkenness In the army
and the disposition of soldiers to leave
their stations for the purpose of obtain
ing spirituous liquors."

Surgeon General Sternberg Modifies
a Former Opinion.
FUSION AGAINST NATIVES.
White Republicans and Democrats of
Hawaii May Unite.
HONOLULU. Sept. 23.â Political signs
now point to a fusion of many Democrats
and a large wing of. the Republican party
in a common move against the native
Hawaiians' ami-white party. The split in
the Republican party grows wider and the
Independent Home Rule party is actively
organizing a campaign on all the islands,
with Robert Wilcox. the former Royalist
and Revolutionist, for Congress as head
of the ticket and with a general anti
white policy. ' Republicans'^ missionary
nn<fl anti-missionary; wings seem hopeless
ly separated. : : . . . â¢
The proposal to fuse with Democrats
.â¢?.me from the missionary side and is
jrged on tre ground . that the native
movement is a serious menace. Natives
have been warned that, their success
means danger 6t disenfranchieement. Says
the Pacific Commercial Advertiser (Re
puMlean): . â¢ : ' Â¦ . . i
"There are warnings also by which the
natives will do well to profit. No white
population of the' quality of that in Ha
waii will ever permit itself to be plun
dered and misruled. An appeal to Congress
for the. modification of the suffrage woukl
be the first move; and if that relief was
denied or too long withheld, then the law
of .Â«clf-iireservation would assuredly be
Invoked. The whit*- people 'of Hawaii de
test and abhor the color line, but if any
cojer Is to rule Hawaii it must be white.
As things are the Republican and Demo
cratic parties are Trilling to fairly divide
honors and officer with the natives; but
neither will submit to an aboriginal antl
haole (white) government." â¢ '.
. The Hawaiian Star, also Republican, ad
vises fusion against natives as a neces
sity. It says; .
"The nearer we get to the election^, the
more clearly is shown that division upon
the party lines of 1 he mainland is inad
visable and that we should, if we wish to
ensure the progress of thÂ» territory, reach
a basis of fusion and elect men to the
Legislature who will represent the pro
gressive, the conservative and the prop
erty holding class." Â¦ i : Â¦ â¢ â¢ Â¦" -Â¦Â¦
"FATHER" CLAB.K TALKS
OF CONDITIONS IN CHINA
Declares That the Blood of Mission

. â¢ - in Vain.
BOSTON, Oct. l^-Al the Congregation
al .ministers' Monday meeting this morn
ing the principal speaker was Rev. Dr
Francis E. Clark, president of the L'nited
Society cf Christian Endeavor, whose
subject was, "Losses and Gains from the
Uprisings in China." .
Dr. Clark, who has visited several mis
sions in North China, ' where the massa
cres lately occurred, said in part:
"The dragon's teeth of war and mas
sacre were sown . by the foreigners
who came In the spirit of commer
cial greed to push their conquests. Turn
the tables for a moment and imagine
China forcing her goods upon us at the
point of the sword, sending her opium
here to debauch our youth and com
pelling- us to buy it, seizing the whole
State of Massachusetts because of two
Chinese murdered by a mob, and we can
imagine some of the feelings which ani
mated the Boxers,- or the more intelli
gent powers- behind the Boxers.
"A heroic chapter of. missionary annals
has been written, a chapter whose records
tan never be dimmed. The native con
vert has proved himself worthy of the
Saviour who died for him. The taunt of
'rice Christian' can no longer be thrown
m his face. China has been awakened
from her sleep cf ages. She can never
again fall back into the same comatose
condition as before. A trumpet call has
been issued to .the Christians of America
and Great Britain to go in and possess
the. land, to see to it that their comrades
have not died In vain."

McCOOK, Neb., Oct. 1.â Governor I
Roosevelt's first day' in Ne
braska may be regarded N as
successful, though the morn-
Ing started out wet and chilly
and the audiences were small. Thirteen
speeches were made during the day. as
the'day advancevl the sky cleartd and the
meetings at the different places along the
way showed a great deal of Interest. Be
sides the inhabitants of villages and
cities a large number of people mounted
and in carriages, evidently from the
country, were noticed around the stands
and on the streets. Probably thirty or
forty thousand people were addressed
during the day. Governor Roosevelt's
special fain remained at McCook until
late in the night, when it pulled out for
North Platte and another day's journey
to-morrow, which will cover a distance of
600 miles, and will Include within that dis
tance eleven speeches. To-morrow night
a Jouwiey will be made to Broken Bow,
at which the train will arrive at 8 o'clock
in the morning. :
Roosevelt's special ' train reached Min
den about 5:10 to-day and the Governor
spoke from a stand erected near the sta
tion. At Has:.'ngs, Holdredge and Ara
pahoe goo.i crcwds collected, evidently
a large proportion of them being country
people. The place arranged tor ihe night
meeting was at McCook, at which place
the train arrived at 8:50 this evening. A
stand had been erected in the city park,
three-quarters of a mile from She staMon,
to which the Governor was conducted.
There was- a large crowd at the station
to meet the train, including an escort of
horsemen, a marching club and a band.
The park was pretty well filled with peo
ple when the Governor arrived at the
speaking place. It was with difficulty that
he reached the platform. The absence of
lights and the extremely unfavorable con
ditions prevented the Governor from
making any extended remarks, and on
being introduced he limited his address
to less than fifteen minutes.
FALLS CITY, Neb., Oct. 1.â The special
train bearing Governor Roosevelt's party
reached this place at 8:20 to-day. The
morning was rainy, but the inhabitants
were at the station to hear Governor
Roosevelt. Many wagons and carriages
brought farmers and their families In
from the. adjoining country. Governor
Roosevelt said:
"I noticed the other day that Mr. Bryan
said that the Republican party had no
right to claim the benefit of the fact that
pork and wheat and corn had gone up.
The Republican party said four years ago
that If its policies were adopted those ar
! tides would go up. Its policies were
1 adopted and they have gone up. You can
j proportion the responsibility as you
choose, giving the Republican party it's
share." . . â¢
BEATRICE, Neb., Oct. 1.â When the
special bearing 1 r. Roosevelt arrived at
Auburn a heavy rain was pouring and
the outdoor meeting which had been ar
ranged for. was impracticable. The meet
ing was held in the opera-house, which
was 'well filled. Governor Roosevelt said
In part:
"During the last four years your home
products here have increased 45 per. cent
your beef products have increased 60 per
cent, and yet we were told four years ago
there would be hard times If the Repub

BRYAN'S INFLUENCE
WANES IN THE WEST
DENVER, Oct. 1.â Senator William M. Stewart of Nevada has given out a statement of his views of the political -
situation In the West and his reasons for believing that Bryan's Influence Is waning In the mountain and Pacific sections. -
"Subordinating silver and making the cause of the rebellion in the Philippines the paramount issue has revolutionized }
the West," the Senator says. "People know what a subordinate' Issue silver Is. Both parties previous to '96 made it a side *
issue for twenty years, and nothing was done. In '96 It was the paramount Issue, but failed. The production of a thou- .
sand millions of new gold and an estimate of four hundred millions during the current year has added to the circulation
about as much as the free coinage of silver would have done, and with the balance cf trade produced by the Dingley
bill has created universal prosperity.
- "When the Democratic convention turned Its back on Towne and all other silver men and arrayed Itself
with Tammany, making imaginary imperialism the paramount issue, the West was disgusted. Bryan's pledges to Agul
naldo, which are keeping alive the guerrilla war in the Philippines, are so unpatriotic and are so much like the conduct
of the Knights of the Golden Circle in ISOu that loyal, citizens repudiate him: â¢
"The West will decide for law, order, good government and the honor of the country, and repudiate anarchism and
rebellion by an overwhelming vote. McKinley, in my opinion, will carry Kansas, Nebraska and Colorado, and my in
formation is that the same revolution has taken place in other mountain States and on the Pacific Coast. The people
understand that Bryan represents nothing in common with them, that he has sidetracked silver, combined with Tam
many and become the leader of the rebel sympathizers who are keeping: up guerrilla warfare In the Philippines. Bryan's
success depends upon the Anti-Imperial League and Tammany. He cannot depend upon the loyal people of the West- Â¦
'.'Besides, the West and the Pacific Coast are practically expansionists. The Philippines are the key to the com
merce of the Pacific. To abandon them would cut the- United States from the markets of the Orient and be a direct
pecuniary Injury to every farmer and producer in ; the United States. The commerce of the Pacific in the near future
will double the business of the Pacific States. The people are nearly ; unanimous for their retention. They deplore any
suggestion looking to the surrender, of any portion of : our Â¦ territory In the Philippine archipelago and they resent with
bitter scorn Bryan's pledges to throw away the Philippines and surrender the country to the rebels in arms."
airy and the Ninth and Tenth "colored
cavalry go up the hill. I saw them leave
behind them 300 dead and wounded hire^
lings. 300 men Who shed their bloorl
for the honor of the flag. 300 men who died
that we might be proud that their country,
still held In' honor the flag.' and the re
ward is that these' men should be sneered
at as hirelings. When you sent your regi
ment to the Philippines its colonel died.
He came from the regular It was
Colonel Stotsenburg . who wrote a new
name on the honor roll of American his
tory, who conferred honor not only on
your State, but on all the nation. Is he
to be .referred to as only a 'hireling'? It
is but a few weeks since Mr. Bryan him
self spoke of cur soldiers as 100,000 men
walking about in Idleness. Colonel Stots
enburg no longer walks about in Idleness.
The men who were In the Philippines, who
stayed there, no longer walk aheut in idle
ness. General I^awton no longer walks
about In idleness, nor does Liscum nor
Reilly, who died at Tientsin. They have
found rest where their comrades from 1861
to 1865. who gave their lives for their flag,
have found jest. Woe to the country that
has lost its capacity to appreciate the
sacrifice of th'? gallant souls who do and
dare and die for its honor and its glory.
Of all ungenerous things the most ungen
erous is to deny the proper merit of honor
to the soldier, whether volunteer like
yourselves, or the regular, as Colonel
Stotsenburg was. Woe to the nation which
refuses to give the proper praise to such
men." '.
At Beatrice Governor Roosevelt made a
speech in the public square. He said in
part:
It material prosperity alone that we
are striving for? It is something more.
We should be proud of the fact that we
are free men and that in the past we have
fought for freedom, and that we are a
great nation which dared to do and to be
great and honored, that we might remain
so. We ask that every young man who
wishes to see this nation stand foremost
among the nations of the word, and to see
this nation do the work of a great nation
and to bring civilization and order Into
the world's dark places, should support us
in this crisis. We do not wish the vote of
the craven or the weakling. They belong
away from us."

Bryan Traverses Pine Barrens and
Scrub Oak Portion of Minnesota.
ST. PAUL. Minn., Oct. 1.â William J.
Bryan to-day traversed what are known
as the Pine Barrens and the Scrub Oak
portion of Minnesota, reaching the agri
cultural portion of the. State north of this
city during the afternoon. He mad? the
first speech of the. day at West Superior,
Wls.. beginning before R o'clock in the
morning. He immediately crossed the St.
L.ouls River at'Duluth and, starting with
an hour speech there, he made speeches
at eight other places on the way. which,
together with the speeches at Duluth and
Superior and those made to-night In this
city, made an even dozen speeches for the
day. Four of the speeches averaged an
hour In duration and the remaining eight
fifteen minutes each. He was accompa
nied throughout the day by. Governor
Lind.
There was a liberal display of small
flags at all the meetings of the day, but
not so many were shown at the small
towns as In the Dakotas.
â¢This- is the sixteenth anniversary of Mr.
Bryan's marriage and the twenty-first an
niversary - of Governor Llnd's marriage.
They celebrated with a Poland water din
ner.
At Hinckley Mr. Bryan made the third
stop of the day. Brief speeches were
made at Rush City and North Branch.
Mr. Bryan spoke fronMi stand erected on
the levee at Stlllwater. A large steam
boat on the St. Crols River was covered
with people, as were several locomotives,
freight cars and car sheds In the vicinity.
Mr. Bryan spoke here for about an- hour,
discussing; at some length most of the is
sues of the campaign. He referred to the
campaign of '96. saying that the members
of the Democratic party had been abused
to ah unlimited extent in that campaign,
I but that notwithstanding this abuse.
when two years afterward- there was a
call to arms It was found that those who
two years before had been denounced as
anarchists were brave men and good sol
diers. If, he said, he had been President
and had done what. Mr, McKlnley had
done, not' one Republican out' of- a hun
dred would have commended . hini. . He
could only account for this upon. the
ground of partisanship, and he appealed
to his hearers to no. longer be controlled
by blind adherence 'to. party,. He wanted
them to read their Bibles where they
would learn that "whom the Lord loveth
he chast.eneth. 1 '. Â¦-..- . Â¦:. â¢ . "" ' â¢ 'Â¦Â¦
In this connection he remarked that
notwithstanding, the "good times," the
sale of Bibles last year had been smaller
than in the average year. .'. The Repub
licans were, he said, spending more time
in defending the "good trusts" than in
denouncing the bad ones. "The only
way," he said, "of distinguishing a good
trust from a bad trust, according to the
Republican Idea, is to go to the trust for
a campaign contribution; if the^ trust
gives liberally It is good; if it gives Bting
ily it is bad."
He said the Republicans knew nothing
about anything but the ice trust. On this
point, he said: . "Not one of you Is hurt
by the ice trust. Every one of you is hurt
by the sugar trust, the lumber trust, the
salt trust. You are hurt when clothing
goes up, when sugar goes up, when stoves
go up, and in all these things you are
hurt, and yet none of you know anything
about any but the ice trust, because the
Republican papers do not keep you in
formed as to what is going on In the trust
question."
Mr. Bryan said he felt about the trusts
as a man had said he felt about bedbugsâ
that he had no objection to them, but did
not like the way they made a living In
this connection Mr. Bryan said:
"A trust is dangerous to the liberties of
the people when they say to their em
ployes thnt it will shut down until after
election for fear of the result of the elec
tion, yet this morning's paper tells you
that the Â«wire trust is closing down its
factories and - telling the \ men nothing
more caii be done until after the election
because people will not send In orders for
fear I will be elected. SuDmlt to this sort
of system, and a government of the peo
ple, by the people and for the people will
be a thing of the past."

KANSAS CiTY, Oct. 1.â Senator Bever

The. capacity of the tent was taxed, stand-.

those whom God has placed In our. hands.
America will not decline because her Institu

Faith In the American peopleâ he who has it
not is an infidel to free institutions; for the

with the keys of the future In their hands.
For the American people are a new race
among mankind; not Anglo-Saxon only, not
Teutonic only, not Celtic only, not Latin only
but the unexhausted elements of all. And I
have faith In them. By our memory of Wash

Tho petition of the University Mound
District for the abatement of nuisances
on Girard, Berlin and Felton streets; at
the corner of Felton and Berlin streets
and on College and Bacon streets between
Hamilton and University streets, was re
ferred to a committee. The petition says
that the Board of Health and Mayor have
been repeatedly asked to abate the nui
sances, but that no action has been taken.
"I am informed," said McCarthy, "that
in every other county in the State the
Assessor pays for the expenses of collec
tion out of the commissions allowed by
the State and I think this should be the
rule in this city."
The resolution was referred to the Ju

tented an ordinance which was referred

tion of land for the proposed square. The
ordinance provides that $50,0<X) be- segre
gated and set apart out of available' funds
now in the city treasury; that henceforth
and until further ordered it be designated
as St. Mary's Square fund to be used to
ward the purchase of the lands bounded
Dy pupont street, St. Mary's place, Cali

also that the board pledges itself to ap
propriate $50,000 more during the next

McCarthy introduced a resolution direct
ing the City and County Attorney to ad
vise the board as to- whether the Asses
sor is or Is not liable out of any commis
sion*, to which he may be entitled for the
expense incurred In collecting poll taxes.
Heed opposed the resolution on the ground
that the City Attorney was at present rep
resenting the city in a suit to restrain
Assessor Dodge from collecting the $15,0)0
now in the city treasury to the credit of
poll tax fees, tteed said that the suit was
'brought on tne presumption that the As
sessor was not entit'ed to one cent and he
could rot understand why an effort was
being made to pay him the fees, less the
expenses of collecting the poll taxes. Mc-
Carthy stated that the question at issue
in court did not bear on whether the As
sessor should pay for the collection of the
taxes and he thought the point should be
settled.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 2, 1900.
Signs of weakness and demoralization
in the Bryan ranks are plainly visible.
Reports from every section of the coun
try herald desertions from the camp of
the Xebraskan. The managers of the Re
publican campaign in California receive
cheering accounts from the interior. In
the city. Republican prospects are bright
ening and predictions are freely mado
that McKlnley will again carry San Fran
cisco.
When the treacherous Boss Martin Kel
ly gained control of the B'nai Brich Hall
convention. Republicans felt depressed,
but thev rallied again and resolved to
support the national ticket with renewed
ardor, and at the game time pledged
themselves to work and vote against the
boss-tainted candidates on the legislative
tickets.
Martin Kelly is working hand in hand
with Democratic bosses to bring about the
election of Dibble to the Assembly from
the Forty-first district, and there " is
strong suspicion that President McKln
ley will be knifed to promote Dibble's
success. Republicans of the district will
make the greatest political mistake ot
the season If they fall to strengthen the
Horace Davis Republican Club of the
Forty-first- The people of tho district
know that this Republican organization
is not dominated by bossesâ that KeUy
cannot use or control it to carry out his
scheme of boss rule. / .
George W. Monteith is out in an open
declaration against Bryan, He gtves some

ti Â° n ' SAN FRANCI3CO. Oct. t. MOO.
Editor Callâ Dear Sir: At tha i earnest re
quest of a number of Mr. Deb.' friends; among
the California Populists. I takÂ» the liberty of
asking you to give uÂ» an opportunity to protest
against tha Infamous and unconscionable
slander that Is being circulated by the Demo
cratic . managers against the motives _of Mx ;
Debs In presenting himself as a candldat* for
Mr Debs was a Popallst down to taÂ© tlmshe
organized the Social Democratic party In 1337.
and is now the candidate of that party for
President. Â¦ Th* PosulisW of. this State have
no electoral ticket In the field, and. will mainly
BUDOort Mr. Debs for President, and In addi
tion to this, he will receive tho active support
of a large number of Democratic! working men.
who prefer the positive position of Mr. Debs
to the uncertain one of Mr. -Eryarw ; This ha*
alarmed the Democratic managers, for it
means an enormous loss to Mr, Bryaa In the
close States of Ohio. Indiana, Illinois. Michi
gan Missouri and California, not to mention
Kansas. Nebraska, South Dakota, Washing
ton and Idaho.' .â¢.Â¦.Â¦â¢' Â¦ : ; .... ; '.Â¦"Â¦Â¦'Â¦. : .\ â¢Â¦â¢â¢"- 'â¢_â¢Â¦ Â¦Â¦Â¦ -<
Â¦ - The. first canard circulated by the- â¢ Demo
cratic managers was to the effect that Mr.
Debs would withdraw in favor of Mr. : Bryan.
Upon this Mr. Debs placed an effective quietuÂ»
by the positive assertion that it waa a cara
palsrn lie pure and simple. â¢! : :â¢'â¢;. Â¦ ;;/
. Havin* been driven front this point the
Democratic managers next assort that-; Mr.
itebs Is being hired by Mark . Ilanna to run.
for the purpose of defeating Mr. Bryan, TSi*.
Is simply infamous. Four years ago Mr-
Bryan . received the hearty, . earnest- aiiit en
thusiastic support of Mr. Eebs and his frtpruls
in the People's party. Mr. D*-bÂ»': newspar^r :
was Mr. Bryan's earnest champion. Mr. L>Â«-bs
used his own earnings tcx make speeches to a.iÂ«J
Mr. Bryan, and it ia needless to say that Mr.
I?ryan was then very glad to receive Mr. DtbsV
enthusiastic support. Like many of the tt$%
of us who are membws of the People's party,
when he found that Mr- Bryan waa Insinom
on direct legislation and opposed tÂ» th- WÂ»,'yj
eminent ownership of railroads, ho forthwith
left him and refused to- support his candtaar>
in the present campaign.. As a result Mr-
Bryan'a Popullstio support has nearly a"
fallen away, and havip? no candltlat- or us
own to support, the People's rartx now\^^ earn
estly indorse the Candidas Â«rf,Â»ta former cam
patriot. Eugfn* V. Oet)s. â¢ Â¦ . Â¦ . tr .
ThÂ«- reople' s party in this State decUne<1 to
nominate an electoral ticket because the Cin
cinnati convention failed to nominate Mr,
Debs. Letters received from the old Peoples
party leader* in nearly every county In the
State show conclusively that the members of
that organization intend to cast their votes
where they will count for direct legislation
and i>ubllc ownershipâ for Eugene V. Debs.
Hundreds of laboring men who are disgusted
with the silly tactics of the Democratic man
agers will cast their ballots for the only can
didate for President that holds a union card.
Eugene V. Debs the man who mortiJrasea his
home and gave his earnings to pay the debts
of the American Railway Union, and who has
devoted his life toward the emancipation or his
fellow laborers needs no apology for standing
before the people as the only candidate who U
true to his convictions. . vj^ : Â¦Â¦Â¦ _- .... - . ; /Â¦Â¦;. v; Â¦.
Tha Democratic managers will find it Is a
coor way to gain Populist votes by lytrtc
about JEusrene V. rvbs. Every working man
who honors his calling will vote f.-Â»r_ the_ man
who honors labor, and . thus record hls'.'baltct.
for the . brightest and ablest 'man that ever
rosefrom the ranks of .the hardy sens of toll-
Eugene V. Debs.:- ..... : ..Â¦-.â¢'Â¦..Â¦.Â¦:..'-Â¦.Â¦,â¢Â¦Â¦ â¢-.-Â¦^ â¢Â¦.'."â¢
The Democrats Insist we must vote for Mr.
Bryan u the lesser of two evils, and to make
our votes count, but we believe in. the prin
ciple that "a ballot righUy cast is Â« votÂ»
never lost," and that by voting .right we will
teach ethers to vote right. '; . '.'-.; Â¦_ '.'_ :.':Â¦

have the election declared invalid upon
the ground that the polls closed at 5
o'clock in conformity with the State law.
Instead of at 6 o clock, as provided by the

Pacley, who in the mf-antime had been
prated, turned the office back to his op

SANTA CLARA. Oct. 1.â Miss Mj6
Wadams. daughter of Dr. w. A. Wadams

a burglar who tried to enter her window
last night. Miss. .Wadams is. an : expert
with a riflo and she put her knowledge of
firearms to good. use. It is believed the
midnight .prowler is low carrying In his.
body a bullet as a memento -of his visit
to. the Wadams home. . Â¦;Â¦ : ':Â¦;
One cf the Wadams children has scar
let fever, the .house is quarantined, and
the young lady is occupying temporary
quarters in the basement. During the iÂ£
ternoon Miss Wadams had been practic
ing with a rifle. When she retired at night
the rifle stood beside her table. Between
11 o'clock and midnignt an intruder Â«ri
deavored to rai?e the window, but a stick
over th<> sash prevented its bcln^ elevatci
more than six inches. '-Alarmed by some
movement in the house the outsider, re
treated to the fence for a time and Miss
Wadams in the interval removed the stioK
and obtained her rifle.
She had waited but a few moments
when the attempt to open the window
was renewed.' The sash. was raised and
the form of a man appeared in the open
ing. Miss Wadams' nerve did not fail:
she blazed away and with a groan the
.prowler fell back through the window and
then retrained his feet and dashed away.
Xo trace of the burBiar could be found
by the alarmed residents in the vicinity.

STOCKTON. Oct. 1.â Either the postal authorities or Collector Lynch will
have to do some lively explaining at headquarters in Washington if the al
legations of a number of Stockton liquor dealers are proved. On June 23 F.
I>ynn. a notary, sent to Collector Lynch's office ?200 in payment for licenses
for local clients. The draft was acknowledged a few days later, but the
dealers are still without their licenses. About a month ago Lynn wrote to
Lynch to the effect that unless me licenses were forthcoming he would re
port their non-arrival to the authorities at 'Washington. Forthwith each of
the liquor 'men received a typewritten statement from the Collector's office
acknowledging that the money had been duly received: that the revenue
licenses had been forwarded, but had miscarried through the mails, and that
the dealer was "square" with the Government and â¢ entitled to conduct his
business. The regular revenue license was not received, and It has developed
that nineteen liquor dealers in Stockton are all In the same predicament.
"One letter Lynch sent me was to the effect that the licenses had
been forwarded," said Mr. Lynn. "In the certificate he sqnt out he stated
that they had been lost. Though he did not say they were lost in the mail,
that is. the inference, for he declarad they had been forwarded, and the mail
is the medium by which they are alwajs sent. I can't see how seventeen let
ters, franked by the Government, could all miscarry."
"James B. Eaton, who also atTends toconsiderable of this class of business,
tells the same story. "I suppose they were lost somehow," he said; "but it
Is strange, because those tax stamps are sent in separate envelopes. I should
think it would not be very difficult for the Government to trace them. Clients
of mine at Linden, Lockeford and Undine failed to get theirs, and I suppose
all have received the same certificates."

tonic which acts directly upon the
sensitive membrane which lines the
entire body. Think a minute.
This delicate skin lines the lungs,
the throat, the head, the stomach,
the liver, the bladder, the kidneys
and the pelvic organs. Suppose it
becomes inflamed. You're "sick and
you don't know what it isâ nothing
but inflammation or catarrh of the
organ affected. : Â¦
Pe-ru-na does not disappoint. It
has cured more /wornen of so-called
"womanly weakness' 'than may be
counted, simply because it went
right to the spot. So long as you
take the wrong medicine 3*ou can-
not expect to be well. Take Pe-ru-

There is not the slightest need In Cali

be added to the already high cost of the
State judiciary.â San Francisco Call. .. :
The Democrat is pleased to note that
The Call stands with the people against
this effort to foist upon the people of Cali
fornia additional officials, when there la
not demand for them. When the scheme
was first advanced bjr Senator Cutter the
Democrat contended that it was entirely
without merit to commend It. Since thea
on two occasions the Democrat had point*
ed out the weak points in the scheme and
advised defeating, both proposed amend
ments should they.'- be* submitted to the;
people. *Â¦ We had taken the- position from
the first that the present system of Judi
ciary is ample for -twice- the,, number of
inhabitants now in the Stater therefore
the ' proposed Â¦ increase in number of
Judges Is entirely unnecessary. Part of
the scheme was to provide for court re
porters in all 'Judicial districts, to be ap
pointed by the co-;rt, with annual salary
instead of per diem when in' actual ser
vice. An- office was to be created and
large salary fixei to be paid but of coun
ty treasury, yet the people were to have
no: voice in. thÂ»> selection of such officer.
Senator Cutter also would: thrust upon
the taxpayers of 'Slitter County a Judge
of the Superior Court at a salary of iW0
a year, wher he knows that It is an un
necessary -burden; With . another Judg.Â»

2gainst Bos* Phelan. At last tliat Journal is backing;
a cause in which every worthy citizen in..San';Ffan
cisco may conscientiously wtsh. "it ;. success Having
created Phelan and placed in his hands the ipo'iver
. which he" is now wielding for bo ill a purpose, , it. Is"
n.cet that the Examiner should take a leading. part in
the work of reducing: its little political puppet to jiis
appropriate level. While its motives may be ignobie
and its efforts more or Ie5Â« discredited fry its recofH
as a' candid and truthful newspaper. neA'crtheless'wc
welcome; it to' the cprnpanJQnshJp of that portion of
the press which.- along with The Call, has always be
lieved Pbelari to be. a{ gas. bag land a pretender" and
never crititled to.the cahfidence r pf : the. people of this
It will be remembered that when the Examiner a
few months ago was moving heaven and earth to as
sist Boss Phelan in foisting upon the Police Depart
ment an incompetent Chiefâ a man remarkable for
r.othing except his friendship for its managing edi
tor â The Call charged the. Mayor with the commis
sion of a felony in making an ante-election promise
2nd challenged h:m to bring the matter into court for
investigation. Did the Examiner then denounce
Phelan "for his offence and Warn the people against
believing in him? Not at all. On the contrary, it qe
rounced The Call for sssaulting a good man who was
endeavoring to discharge for the common weal a
necessary, public duty, .. " .'
Why has the Examiner waited all these, years to
discover that Boss Phelan is a pretender and a fraud^
a small politician without: motive save the .gratifica
tion of his personal nmbition and the filling of all the
offices within his gift with his friends and adherent-;?
It will be difficult to * nswer. this question except by
pointing to the. fact that it. was not until Boss Phelan
had refused to give it seven places upon. the legisla
tive and judicial. ticket, and present it with the scaip
of Judge Dairigerfield., that, it ascertained the fright
ful condition of affairs in lhe local Democratic party.
From the beginning Phelan was a newspaper in
spiration. While othor San Francisco presses are not
entirely blameless for advertising him and extolling
his alleged virtues, without the Examiner's support he
would never have reached any higher position in
politics than manager of a district club or manipu
lator of a district primary. If he is now possessed of
the autocratic authority in the Democratic party al
leged by that journal, and i? using it. as alleged, for
the purpose of dissipating taxes and filling the muni
cipal departments with the adherents of his machine,
who is re5ponsib1e? v
It follows from these premises that in its iconoclas
tic contest with Boss Phelan our esteemed contem
porary, the Examiner, will not secure from the people
much aid or comfort. With respect to political
bosses the Examiner's policy for years has been dis
tinguished not for truth or candor but for the want
of them. For many .1 year the Examiner was an ally
of Boss Buckley. Later on, it is true, the Examiner
aided The Call and other papers to dethrone Buck
ley, but no sooner hid that political potentate been
"driven out of town than it proceeded to create and in
stall another boss in the person of Boss Phelan.
.As With Orators ?o with newspapers. Indeed it is
itrore essential that newspapers should be distin
puished fprtrmh and candor than that any other in
itruriientaiity for the propagation of reason and tn
teiligence should be fp distinguished; first, because
tiey . ><!dreÂ«s tlieir audiences every day and are con
stantly before them for inspection; second, because

What can. the country expect from an administrar
tion which gets power by such influences? What can
it do for the country that will be safe and sound and
conduce to its prosperity? What headway can it
make against a powerful, majority of its own party .in
Congress that stands unbroken and determined to
hold the Philippines? And what can the sound money
men and those who believe in the constitutional co
ordination and independence of. the judiciary do to
restrain.it in effectuating its policies toward the cur
rency and the courts?' ;. Â¦[.....'.:.. .
We ask thinking men who oppose expansion and
?ound money men. who oppose .financial empiricism
to look before they leap and think- before they vote.
It will be seen that Bryan, relies upon those who
repudiate his. paramount issue to give him 120 elec
toral votes, and upon those who repudiate all his othe r
issues to add the electoral votes, necessary to give him
a majority. " . -. ; - : ..'/Â¦/Â¦.â¢-*â¢" -..'Â¦
The South, perhaps, wants all the domestic; changes
threatened by Bryan and it wants the Philippines, and
will get all it wants. . ,. . : . â¢. .
It will be seen, then, that in electing Bryan the anti
expansionists of. the North will be getting all. that they
do not want, from free silver to a greenback basis,
and will not get the one thing. they do want.
We have reproduced columns of demands for hold
ing the Philippines, published as editorial in. the Ex
aminer and some of it signed by Hearst himself.
Seven-tenths of the daily papers in the South, are
against Bryan's "paramount issue." â¢ In that section
Democratic leaders openly say that if Bryan is elected
the South will control Congress and will not permit
the alienation of the Philippines. To our mind it is
ns plain as anything in the future can be to man, tint
if elected Bryan will not alienate the Philippines. He
will not let them go, because lie canriot. The treaty
of Paris, for which he lobbied, specifically leavestheir
fiUure status to Congress, and a Democratic Congress
controlled by the South will^hold tliem hard and fast.
..In the issue now in focus Morgan of Alabama,
chairman of the Committee of Foreign Affairs in the
Democratic Senate, was the first advocate of holding
the Philippines. In a speech in this city in 1898, be
fore Manila fell, he raid: (< Our flag is in thcPhilip
pines to stay. The hand of God planted it there, and
it will not be hauled dewn." . : : :
They are asked to give Colonel Brj'an the power
to do all these things because he. promises them what
they want as to the Philippines. Will they get it?. If
Bryan is elected the party behind him will have a .vast
majority in the South. That section will give him
120 electoral votes. \o which anti-expansionists are
asked to add enough to make a : majority in the Elec
toral College. The South is the only section. that is
practically unanimous for expansion, for holding the
Philippines, and even for violating our pledge of in
dependence to Cuba. When we state this westate a
fact. Expansion had its birth in the South. . That
section Tias always Â¦ wanted the West Indies. The
Democratic party split in i860, and its two wings
agreed in only one thing. Each, in its platform, de
manded the seizure and annexation of Cuba.J.DifTer
ing about slavery in the Territories^ and; quarreling
over the constitutionality of disunion, they heartily
agreed in supporting the Democratic doctrine of the
Ostend manifesto-" â¢"â¢".â¢": -.. . '-V '.'Â¦'Â¦
We have stated his purposes from the several, plat
forms on which he stands and from his own pledge;,
uttered on the stump. He findshimself unable to gain
power by the votes of those who stand with him in
urging the necessity of the changes he proposes. They
are in a minority. Without -aili'es their, cause is. hope
less. To get the necessary allies he appeals to the
opponents of expansion. '.â¢Â¦'Â¦ ' .'Â¦ Â¦ . ' â¢ -" '
Now this class, numesous and conscientious and in
telligent, do not want any of the changes, innovations
and novelties which ColonelBryan is pledged to se
cure. They are opposed to free silver, to degradation
of the courts, to taking away the co-ordinate charac
terof the Supreme Court, to impairing the freedom
of contract, to putting the country on a greenback
basis and to the sudden and destructive liquidation of
the national banks. : : :
If he is a man possessing aspark of honor, or ever,
ordinary personal prudence, the power of his office
will at once be used.m effecting these objects. If he
is elected he will carry a House of Representatives
in with him, and the Senate will pass into his control
easily in the middle of his term. ... : . -V '
IF elected Colonel Bryan stands pledged for free sil
ver at 16 to 1; to the abolition of representative
government by direct legislation; to the destruc^
tion of judicial independence, by jury trial for con
tempt of court; to a change in the life tenure of Sut
preme Court Justices, and the degradation of that
court as a co-ordinate branch of the Government; to
denial of the freedom o\ contract; to plunging the
Government into the dangers, difficulties and corrup
tion of public ownership : of all the instruments of
commerce; and, finally, to the unlimited emission of
greenbacks as a legal tender currency, with all its con
sequences, including the. disappearance of. gold and
silver both from circulation arid the progressive de
cline of the purchasing power of the paper. This last
in\-olves, as he ?dmits. the overthrow of our banking
system and the sudden liquidation of every national
bank in the country. : Â¦

the Republican ticket the splendid and unprecedented
majority of 1896. In this State, indeed, the majority
will be larger than before; for not only are many old
Democrats refusing" to follow Bryan any further, but
thousands of Republicans who were" misled on the

- rvFTER thirty years, of active work
/~\ in the ranks and up in front of the
/ \ Democratic party. Colonel George
1 . ':Â¦*Â¦ W. Warder, the Kansas City law
yer, and author, has left his party and
gone over to the Republicans.
; Colonel Warder has always- stumped the
East . for the Democratic ticket. Four
years ago he. worked in New York City,
Brooklyn, Long Island City and up the
Hudson. His free silver book, "Man and
Mammon," was used by Bryanites all
through the campaign and sent out by the
literary bureau by. the. carload. In the
following vigorous statement he gives his
reasons for abandoning the Democracy:
. '.'Editor. San Francisco Call: As a life
long Democrat who helped to fight the
battles- of. Democracy, was proud of its
expansion record, and never faltered In
the hours of its trials and defeats, I am
forced by my convictions to utterly repu
diate the 'paramount Issue' In the Demo
cratic platform. That any such issue real
ly exists as 'imperialism or militarism,' or
that any part of our people or their lead
ers are contending for an empire, and any
other part trying to retain it as a repub
lic, I do not believe, and deem It a slander
on the.patriotlc masses of our free, and
united country. Any man who can see in
this. 'paramount issue- any issue of fact
to justify such an assumption, to my mind
is either- blinded, by political prejudice,
ignorant of modern history or mentally
tpo obtuse to know a political 'fake' when
he sees .it.. . . . â¢'â¢'. â¢ 'â¢' .-. Â¦'â¢'- Â¦
"I am. compelled to regard It as 'the
fiat'- creation- of a distorted fancy, the
product -of a political juggler converting
warm air Into political fireworks â a man
ufactured issue made wholly out of fic
tion,-mlsstatements and misapprehensions
Â¦^in fact, a myth, a delusion and a lame
and impotent conclusion^ intended to mis
lead the. ignorant and unthinking; . It Is
also- intended .to conceal a covert attack
on modern progress and expansion, which
if successful would emasculate our na
tion into .powerless imbecility and dwarf
Â¦its future glory and greatness.
; '.'All this'-.- blatant -.bosh and. bombast
about, a republic or an empire, a Presi
dent or an. Emperor, if it were not so
silly.: absurd: and; hypocritical would
amount to a- slander on the most united
and enduring' republic In the world's his
tory. And the-. thinking, patriotic citizen
who will listen to 1% without a blush is
incased, in political., prejudice and is a
greater menace to our free institutions
than all the imperialism and militarism
that ever marched in the form of an
American soldier under the flag of our
country.- .... ' \ â¢ . â¢ â¢ . . ' . .
"It Is by such erratic and unpatriotic is
sues as these that the Democratic party
has reversed its affirmative principles and
lost the confidence of the business inter
est? of the country, has elected but one*
. President in . forty years and become
known as the party of mammoth blunders
and colossal failures, without harmonious
leaders, fixed principles â¢ or affirmative
concrete powerâ a mere party of negation
with conglomerate followers . for the
loaves and flshea of bfllce. God speed the
day when party spirit will be so weak
and Â¦ patriotism so strong that the vast
majority of our people will disregard the
.wishes of party , and party leaders and
consider only the good of oil r common
country. Â¦. * . ": .. ; - '. â¢ . â¢.-.-/..
"I supported Mr. Bryan four years ago
with, all the powers I could command. I
made speeches for him in nearly every
ward in New York City,. Brooklyn, Long
Island City and also up the Hudson and
in this State. I also wrote a book on free
silver, entitled 'The Conflict Between Man
and Mammon,' which' was largely used
as a textbook on that subject. For this
I have no apologies to make, as I followed
my convictions of right and duty. But
tiniesi.' facts and; conditions change and
men must change with them or become
laggards or Imbeciles. :â¢

Judge deeided lhat, ' having, shipped from
New York, the Chinese had a right to land
in any other American port, and Honolulu
is npw-an American port. The.decisior. is
regarded as highly important as bearing
upon "the question of whether the many
Chinese in the. Hawaiian Islands have a
rightto land on .the mainland.- A clause in
the Hawaiian territorial act declares that

The defendant alleged that the premises
were excepted from. the grant to the rail
road company by reason of the fact that
it contained sranite valuable for building
purposes, and that the defendant Â¦ had
made entrv of the premises under the
mineral laws of. the United States. Judge
Gilbert, who wrote the -opinion for the
Circuit Court of Appeals. Said:
Â¦ "The question In this case is whether
land whifch is chiefly valuable for granite
of a pood merchantable quality 13 mineral
land within the meaning of the exception
from the grant of lands to the ' Northern
Pacific Railrcad Company. The term
'mineral' embraces everything not rÂ»f the
mere surf ace â¢ which is used for agricul
tural purposes. The granite, as well as
metallic ores and. fossils, are comprehend
ed within it. We entertain no doubt that
in the reservation of mineral lands .from
the grant to the -Northern Paciflc Railroad
Company the cranlte " quarry in contro
versy was included. The land in contro
versy was land valuable chiefly for stone,
and as such was offered for sale. Decree
of the Circuit Court affirmed."
The railway company appealed froin the
decree of the Circuit Court .dismissing its
bill in the suit brought to restrain Soder
berg from removing granite from the
northeast quarter of Section ID. Township
27: north; range 10- east, in the '. State of
Washington. The bill alleged that the
land was part of- the odd numbered sec
tion within the forty mile limits of the
rrant to the railroad Company; that the
title passed to the railroad company upon
the. location of its line of road. It was
alleged also that upon the land In contro
versy Is a deposit of granite valued at
more than $5000, and that the defendant
was engaged in quarrying and. removing

Hunters who looked out cf their win

it. was also a good day for "qua!!." Hal

annotinced the opening of the quail an4

execution on the marshes. Many big bags

The Fish Commissioners and their depu
ties, knowing the penchant of some hunt
ers to shoot before the game was on. kept
close watch on the incoming' trains and
confiscated many good bags. One Â¦wise
hunter sent down five dozen quail in a
trunk, which was tightly bound with Ma
nila rope, but the eagle eye of the deputy
spotted the feathers and he retrieved the
bag-jrase with bttter judgment than a good

According to Fish Commissioner Bab

his statement on the three bags which
Â¦were confiscated by his officers and Â¦which
bore the names of the fair ones.

. What might have proved a pretty con
test, the 2:30 trot, was spoiled almost at
the very commencement by a harsh and
finely drawn decision from the stand Iu
declaring Zaxlna distanced in the opening
heat. The Spreckels entry brought $>
against $20 for Janice, the field going for
$3. To a straggling start Janice took the
lead after a quarter had been covered,
and, driven out, beat Charley Me a length
in 2:17&. Sent away lengths behind the
leading horse, causing a big howl from
her backers, Zarina just managed to get
Inside the distance flag, Jeffries driving
the mare to a break. The judges di-anced
her for running, evidently having lorgot
ten all about the Osito episode. The favor
ite was -not at her best, for in the next
two . heats Charlie Me made a great bid
and but for a break seventy yards from
the wire in the third would have won.
Boiled down to a field of four Â¦tarters,
nothing looked to have a chance for tha
stake with Monterey, which sold a CO to
JS choice over the field. Two "jlmmys"
caused him to finish third in the first heat,
Osito leading out Alta Vela by a narrow
margin. With no nervous fluctuations in
tho speculating, the second heat was dif
ferent. Pete "Williams had Monterey
trimmed for action, going out to distance
the other three starter. By some rag
time steps, a hop, step and a Jump and a
swell mazourka glide, Durfee, holding the
ribbons over Osita. Just missed the bunt
ing, but Alta Vela and Iron Alto were re
tired from business. The two following
heats were only Jogs for the odds-on fa
vorite. Â¦Â¦'Â¦. ft Â¦Â¦'.
Everybody . had it reckoned that Tags,
the Woodland mare, had been left a leg
acy, and she sold a Jia to $3 fa'vorite over
her company in the betting Indulged In on
the 2:30 pace. Quite handily the daughter
of Diablo polisned off her field In the
opening heat, causing the price to shorten
up considerably, 520 to $6 being the auction
quotation. In the second heat Bunch, be
hind Fredericksburg, buckled up with
Tags, and after a ding-dong struggle beat
the favorite out a neck in 2:15.. xne-heat
winner proved a poor repeater, for the
first choice won the two following heats
more than handily.
M. P. Tarpey, Joseph Cairn Simpson and
Ed Smith did the judging, the latter also
acting as starter. . â¢ - \
The sport was above the average., Of
course the Western stallion stake had the
place of honor on the card, and was cap
tured by the veteran Pete "Williams with
ilonterey, 2:09}4, the other starters being
outclassed. The bis chestnÂ»* reeled off
the second heat In 2:12. now the track

Janice the 2 JO trot.

In the ancient times it was the custom
to bring two goatb to the temple, one for
sacrifice and the other as a "scapegoat"
upon which the sins of the people were
cast, and then by prayer and atonement
the scapegoat was purged of these sins
and he was allowed to go free Into the
wilderness. It was symbolical r,f the
power of atonement, for the animal once
burdened with sin. was freed and allowed
to depart cleansed of its wickedness by
prayer and sacrifice.

The friends of S. Higashida, the Japa
nese who was fond with his skull frac
tured alongside of the Harrison-street
bridge at an early hour Sunday morning,
believe that he is the victim of a rival for
the hand of a young woman with "whom
the young man Was on friendly terms.
They claim that his supposed assailant,
jealous at his attentions to the woman,
waylaid him/ intending to put him. out of
the way. They point to the" injuries of the
unfortunate Japanese as . proof positive
that ho could not have fallen off the
bridge, aiÂ« claimed by the police.
In- speaking about the case one of the
Injured man's, friends, who Is assisting
the detectives In unraveling the mystery,
said yesterday: â¢ â¢
"Iligaahida frequently spoke of being in
love with a Japanese girl, but he never
mentioned her name to me. Only a few
days before he was assaulted he confided
in me that a rival for' the girl's hand had
endeavored to influence her agulnst him,
and,' failing In the attempt; he swore to
be revenged. He feared that the man
would carry out hi? threat,, and, as he
seemed to be unusually alarmed, I ad
\iped him to appeal to the police for pro
tection. He left me to go to the police
headquarters, and that was the last time
I paw him until I was notiiled that he
was In the Receiving Hospital suffering
from a fractured skull. 1 am satisfied
that his rival followed him as far as the
Harrison-street bridge and inflicted the
lniurlea from which lie is now suffering."
Detectives Wren and Ulnan, who are
working on the case, are half Inclined to
believe that the Japanese fell off the
bridge while under the influence of liquor.
They, however, cannot account for the
condition of his clothes, which were al
most torn from his body, except that he
may have engaged in a "scrap" before he
walked on the bridge.
Yesterday the detectives visited the
Japanese in the hospital and endeavored
to have him explain how he had been In
jured. He claimed that he did not know
whether he was assaulted or fell off the
bridge. His mind seems to be blank on
the subject, but he was able to give an in
telligent account of his wanderings Just
before he reached Harrison street. To-day
the detectives intend to find out who the
woman is with whom the Japanese was
on fripndly terms and' endeavor to get
from her the name of Higashlda's rival.

"Mlgnon" was sung at the TIvoll last
evening. The performance, considered
from a purely artistic point of view. Was
one of the best of the present season.
Conscientious care was taken and the re
sult was, with certain limitations, highly
praiseworthy. The tenor role was beyond
the capacity of Slgnor Russo, although
he manfully attempted to do it Justice.
Signorina Poletlnl appeared as Mignon.
Her voice and style are excellently adapt

Lichter. who assumed the role of Fillna,
sang brilliantly and was recalled after an
exceptionally good rendition of the "Po

The orchestra scratched along without
any distressing deficiencies, but â¢ that
chorus! They, poor souls, having a
natural desire to eat, drink and be
clothed, art not to be blamed for trying
to earn a living in any honest way. But
whatever superior power prompted or al
lowed them to attempt the Impersonation
of Egyptian ladles and nobles was guilty
of gross cruelty, .both to them and to the
public â to them because exposing them 10
ridicule on account of their poverty of
voice and vesture; to the public because
however criminal that public it has done
nothing to deserve the frightful punish
ment of hearing those magnificent Verdi
choruses murdered as they were laat
night. The opera would have gone in
finitely better had they been omitted.
When'Signor Azzali departs he should
leave, his chorus with us; California is a
State rich and generous, offering a wide
field for unskilled labor. There is even
now a brisk demand for such labor on our
mesas and' in orchards at prices varying
from Jl 25 to $2 a day. That is the proper
field for the Azzali chorus; there can they
labor* grow rich and be happy. ; Only they
must not sing at their work.
L. DU PONT SYLE.
To these general remarks an exception
must he made In favor of Signorina Bar
bareschi, who played the part of Aida last
night. This lady is an actressâ a better
actre=3 than a singer â who at times suc
ceeded even in imparting some of her own
histrionic tire to performers who had
scenes with her; but for the most part it
was a case of flint striking, not on steel,
but on wood. Signor Bellagamba as
Amonasro came nearer than any of the
other men to N making his part credible.
There' I-s. an Arcadian provincialism and
a pleasing Ingenuousness about the be
havior on the stage of our friends .the Ai
zalls that corresponds with what is known
of their delightful ignorance of the value
of a dollar off the stage. It seems emi
nently fitting that a company which has
but prehistoric conceptions of the differ
ence between Past, Present and Future
should approach the presentation of that
most primitive of art forms, opera, with
a naivete as guileless as that which
marked the gambols of the Hellenic vil
lagers around the altar of Bacchus, or the
untoward Outings wherewith Polyphemus
wooed his coy Galatea.
The Azzali theory of opera Is simply
this: You come upon the stage and you
sing your little piece just as well as you
can; if anybody else happens to be on the
stage at the same time, so much the worse
for him; you are there to sing for your
self, and everybody must look out for
himself, as you do. By this method you
get some excellent solos and occasionally
(by happy chance) some good concerted
music, but you get nothing else. The en
tire performance resolves Itself Into a con
cert, wherein the singers wear fancy in
stead of everyday costumes, and where
the audience is at liberty to call out the
said singers at the end of each number.
With such an entertainment dramatic
criticism has nothing to do, for there is
nothing dramatic about It.

In "A Night in Town" Eddie Foy has
found a vehicle for Just the kind of fun
that has ma.de him famous. In that far
cical comedy of Italian origin Foy can
wear grotesque clothes, sport a red wig
and make up his face in a way to shame
his mother. All these things the comedian
does and does them well, besides singing
a bit and dancing a bit and making love a
bit in a way peculiarly his own and war
ranted never to win a girl.
There is not overmuch story to "A
Night in Town," but just enough to string
together three fun-crammed acts and to
give the playlet an excuse for being. The
company is worthy of the farce, and be

Matrimony has not injuriously affected

dispel any of the chill that might have
fallen upon her spirits by reason of hrr
vacation away from the genial warmth of
the footlights, and she v.-as true woman
enough to appreciate and reciprocate
right heartily, for she sang with a vim
and feeling that brought back the old
times again. Of the several songs with
which she delighted the audience each one
was better than the one that preceded it.
and when in response to an encore she
sang "The Holy City" she opened up her
voice to its clearest and purest tones.
Whatever defect there may be in her vo
calization was more than atoned for by
the sincerity and grace of her work and

easy to Imagine the delighted curiosity
with which the street urchins of Byzan
tium must have followed suca a gar
ment, which. In spite of Its pictorial eluci
dation of the miracles, must iiave been
about as graceful as the advertising
boards upon the back of the modern itin
erant. What wonder that a righteous
Bishop of the church Inveighed againsc
those "who wore the gospels upon their
backs instead of in their hearts.
About this time the Emperor Justinian
devised an expedient for breaking up the
silkworm trust, the Chinese having en-
Joyed an unbroken monopoly of this In
dustry for nearly twenty centuries. To
this end he sent two Itinerant Persian
monks into China, where they so cunning
ly evaded the vigilance ot the natives that
they were able to bring home their hol
low staves filled with silkworm eggs.
From the rearing of the worms thus
craftily brought to Byzantium sprung the
European silkworm Industry.
During the seventh century the rise of
Mussulman power brought a new spirit
Into waning Byzantine elegance and as a
result the resplendent costumes of the
caliphs soon beggared description. The
embroiderer's art then extended Its prov
ince to the exquisite decoration of leather
work â boots, saddles, harness and scab
bards, as well as the swords and daggers,
which they covered, being lavishly dec
orated by the needleworker. So devot?Â«i
were the nomadic Arab chieftains tr>
beautiful hangings that they Invariably
carried with them their superbly embroi
dered tents, one of which the famous
Haroun-al-Raschld sent to Charlemagne

Lydian people to have been the Inventors
of embroidery, the Roman word "pbryglo"
meaning embroiderer. To this day. the
women of this portion of Asia Minor em
broider their head coverings, towela.
aprons and bodices in the Phrygian bands
of animals, rosettes and birds so largely
borrowed by the Greeks and Ionians for
decorating their pottery. The pictures on
Greek vases and the ornamental incisions
on the draperies of Greek statues show
great diversity of design, however, prov
ing that this esthetic nation comprehend
ed the restrictions and the possibilities of
the art of embroidery. as well as the other
arts. Helen and Penelope's accomplish
ments In this line were sung by the early
poets, and upon a Greek vase from Chinsi
Penelope is depicted as ornamenting with
richest needlework one of the. beautiful
Â¦ robes . from her loom. Many, of the an
cient so-called tapestries have been re
cently proved to be embroideries; for em
broidery presupposes .a foundation, and
these ancient fabrics clearly show that the
ornamentation was stitched through the
foundation instead of being woven, into
its substance, as Is tapfestry. : -
Embroideries were used primarily as
distinctive marks of a chief's costume, as
'supplemental to Â¦ religious ritual and as
ingenious lntensifiers of feminine charm.
These results were obtained by the simpl
est machinery a needle and thread. The
primitive needle, regarded merely as ihe
sharp continuation of a 'pliable- thread.
Was made successively of thornv fishbone,
Â¦wood, bone and ivory before the- present
metal form was devised. The primitive
thread was undoubtedly wool. The Inven
tion of flax liber for linen has been at
tributed to .Isla, and is rhentioned -among
the vestments of - the high -priest Aaron

THE chances are that the steam
schooner Jcanie, which went on
the Point Arena rocks, will be a
total loss. She is lying in a posi
tion where it is almost impossible
to reach her. and after several hours of
vain endeavor the tug Rescue gave it up
and Is now on her way back to San Fran
cisco.
The Jcanle Is jammed In between two
reefs south of the lighthouse. The reefs
project -400 yards out from the cliffs. Out
beyond the reefs are a number of rocks,
some visible and some sunken, but all a
menace to navigation. It was at first
thought that the steamer could be got off,
as she was resting lightly and the swell
was not great. A telephone message to
San Francisco brought the Rescue to the
pcene, but Captain Dan Thompson soon
found that in order to save the Jeanie he
would have to imperil his own boat. With
30<> fathoms of hawser he could not reach
the stranded vessel, so the attempt was
given up. The vessel is fully Insured, and
the only people who will be out and in
jured will be the underwriters.
A year ago the Jeanie was a four-mast
ed steam schooner. When she came back
from the Arctic, however, she was remod
eled and made into a modern three-mast
ed vessel. She was on her way from San
Francisco to Comox. B. C. where she was
to load coal for Hunters Bay. On her ar
rival at that point she was to bring home
the salmon pack put up for the Pacific
Steam Whaling Company.
OCEAN MYSTEEY SOLVED.
Mainmast Seen Was That of the
Schooner Daisy Bowe.
Friday last the John G. Xorth arrived
from Â¦ Honoipu and ' reported passing a
broken mast ln an upright' position on
September 25 In latitude 35 .degrees 37 min
utes north, longitude 123 degrees .west. The
captain's opinion was that' the wreck was
either the mast of a small vessel or the
topmast of a square-rigger, with yards
and hamper below water. â¢
On September 22 the schooner Daisy
Rowe left here for Grays Harbor. She
was caught in the heavy gale that nearly
wrecked the Flintshire- and was driven
south. On Monday, September 24, her
mainmast went by the board, and she has
been ever since beating her way back to
San Francisco. The Mail Company's
steamer San Bins spoke her twenty-five
miles southeast by south of Point Sur and
proffered assistance, but none was re
quired. The mast seen by the crew of the
John G. North was undoubtedly the one
blown out of the Daisy Rowe.
Was Also in the Gale.
The schooner Lucy was compelled to put
ln here for repairs yesterday. She was on
her way from San Pedro for Umpqua, and
on September 29 carried away her fore
mast head. The foresail and headgear
also went by the board, and the schoonei
was so disabled that she had to run for
San Francisco. A new foremast will be
put in and the Lucy will continue her voy
age to Umpqua. .
Struck by Lightning.
The German steamer Verona, now being
fitted out as a transport to carry, horses
to China, had a peculiar experience while
in Nagasaki. During an electrical storm
a flash of liprhtninj? struck the foremast
and cut it off as clean as a knife would
have done just below the second band. No
one on board was hurt, but the sensation
as the topmast came tumbling down dur
ing the pyrotechnical display was' a pecu
liar one.
Uncle Sam wants- to ger supplies to his
men in China, so he is utilizing the Ger
man transports. What the Kaiser wants
in China is horses and what Uncle Sam
wants'is provender. So the German trans
poTts will carry German horses and Amer
ican supplies. In that way the- transports
will earn double. pay.' . ;

was in before Uncle Sam secured her aa

most as much to put the vessel back into
her old shape a a it did to fit her out.
The Nurnburg has not got away for

The art of lace making was Introduced
into Ireland during the 'middle . of the
eighteenth century by a Jesuit who
brought thither a piece of Venetian lace
as a pattern. On this account much of
the needlepoint lace done In. convent
schools is known as- "Jesuit lace." In 1346
special efforts were made to encourage
the spread of lace making as a means of
support to the famine stricken -populace.
Applique, Limerick lace, Irish tatting and
Cork crochet lace, known as point d'lr

but the most; popular of all Ik the Irish

CALL BUREAU. WELLINGTON
HOTEL, WASHINGTON. Oct. Lâ August
exports to Asia and Oceanica show a fall
ing. Off of nearly $3.i>00,iXi0 as compared
with August of last year. There are two
reasons for this: first, the- war. in China;
Feccmd. the refusal of exporters . on ihe
Pacific Coait to furnish statements of the
value of their exports to the Hawaiian
Islands, which they claim are no longer
foreign territory, and therefore the Bu
reau of Statistics has no authority to re
quire a statement of the quantity and
value of merchandise passing between
those islands and the United States.
The reduction In expgrts to China Is
from $1,31:.-' 3 in August. VS33; to $2H>,3yO in
August. J& K ->. due of. course to the exist
ence ot hostilities in that, country. Th<*
apjiufenf reduction in exports to â¢ Hawaii
is Irom $l,us7,4i:i in August. 1390. to nothing
in 190u, though it. is probable that if the
facts were known the exports to the Ha
waiian Islands in August.' law, would
fhew a much larger sunj than in August.

Notwithstanding these adverse condi

one apparent, our exports to Asia and

months ending with August, an . increase
of more than -0 per cent over those of the
corresponding months of last year, aa
against an increase of 9 per cent in our
exports to the South American countries
and 14 per cent in our exports to Europe,
In no other part of the world do Ameri
can exports thow as rapid an increase as
in Asia and Oceanica. To Japan our ex
ports during the eight months ending
with August amount to more than $21,-
OJO.OOO, as against $12,000,000 in the corre
sponding months of last year; to China,
our exports in the seven months ending

early were 2,500.000 bu$hels. World shipments

there was rain in the Northwest and rain pre
dicted- for to-morrow. ' Northwestern markets
turned strnns: as an additional help. These
two Influences sent "the prices on- the- upward
road, and when tt was announced the visible
increase was- only. -416,000 bushels a further ad-

"I notice that you have- determined upon
the full tax rate allowed by law and that
departments pf the government are not
fully provided for notwithstanding.

Â¦ The wealth of our. city has doubtless
kept - pace with its marked increase in
populatfon. but the Assessor seems Â£ to
nave been tmable to find it for the pur
pose or taxation.: Our charter gives the
Mayor no power to reduce the expenses
or .departments r.or . to -increase the
revenue of the citr," 'Â¦ ' â¢Â¦--

Now that San Francisco Tent has been
fully Installed in the new, pleasant Mac
cabee Temple, in Pioneer building ar
rangements are being made to Increase
the membership of the tent. An effort
is being made to secure, the services of
Deputy Supreme Commander E. A. S.
Blake, with the idea of having him de
vote his entire time to increasing the
membership to the Â£00 mark. State Com
mander S. W. Hall at the last held review
of this tent in an address praised the of
ficers and members for their continued
efforts to bring the tent to the position
it now occupies, one of the leading ones
in the jurisdiction.
Last week the members of the two
teams that entered into a contest
in San Francisco Tent to see which
would bring In the greatest number â¢ of
members within a stated period had a
banquet In a downtown rotisserie, the
winners being entertained by the losers.
There were about thirty present and a
very enjoyable evening, was spent. After
dinner there was an hour of talk for the
good of the order, music, song and story
telling.
Republicans are much pleased with
this evidence that Jackson, jbe pat
ron saint of the Democracy, had to
face charges of Imperialism. They
point out that he squelched the nulll
flers of South Carolina "without the
consent of the sroverned." and that
he vetoed the charter of the national
bank In the face of popular opinion,
and they are grlad to oe able to show
that the cry of imperialism has not
succeeded aa a bugaboo In the paat.

The Republican .' National- Commit
tee has â¢ discovered a poster of the
campaign of 1S22 arraigning Andrew
Jackaon aa an imperialist.- The com
mittee has reprinted the bill in fac
simile and is sending lOOJXXJ copies
broadcast through the land. An ex
planatory note' at the top begins:.
"The Cry of Imperialism la Not
New."
In the campaign of 1S32 Jackson was
lampooned- under the title of "King
Andrew .the First." His political op^
ponents pretended to believe that his
re-election was a menace to free gov
ernment and the liberties of the peo
ple. They caricatured him In the
trappings of royalty. They pictured
him In the act of trampling the Fed
eral constitution and the charter of
the bank of the United States tinder
his feet.
The pester unearthed by the Repub
licans was found amons the forgotten
relics of the Smithsonian Institution
at Washington. It bears at Its top a
large engraving- of President Jackson
In kingly robes and crovm. Under the
picture Is the title, "King Andrew the
First," and above it Is the sarcastic
sentence, "Born to Command." At
the sides are the lines, "Had I Been
Consulted" and "Of Veto Memory."

gutted by fire yesterday afternoon. The
loss will approximate $3000. The blaze
started from a defective flue between two
walls and the firemen .worked with dlfD

had It entirely extinguished.
The flames were discovered bj^Jnelgh

to be carried to the strtet. An alarm was
turned In from box 216 and when the de
partment arrived they found that the fire
was a blind one and on account of the
burning building's proximity to adjoining
houses might result seriously. After two
hours' "work, however, the flames were
subdued without damage to other prop
erty.

The equipment of thp Southern Pacific
Is to be strengthened Immediately by the
addition of 2000 new box cars and forty
four engines. This Is one of the biggest
orders any railroad In the world has ever
placed for Its freight equipment at a
single time. Some of the cars have al
ready begun to arrive and the entire lot
must be shipped within ninety days. The
engines are to he here within thirty days.
"We are trying to avoid a ft eight block
ade," said Julius Kruttschnitt, gen
eral manager of the company." In
explaining the occasion for such a
big order yesterday. "Our freight
traffic has been climbing up at a
tremendous rate for several years and we
have found It absolutely necessary to
enlarge our equipment. Last year was a
record breaker for us. We simply couldn't
handle all the business, despite the fact
that we put on more men and doubled our
force of Inspectors. We got from 15 to 20
per cent more work out of this added
force, but even that wasn't sufficient to
overcome the enormous Increase In busi
ness. This year we have endeavored to
provide for all emergencies, The indica
tions point to a rrpotltion of last winter's
business. If our expectations are realized
we will be prepared by 2000 extra freight
cars and . half a hundred additional
engines."
The cars are bflng manufactured by the
American Car and Foundry Company of
Huntir.gton. W. V. The Southern Pacific
now has 2500 of these extra-size cars and
the new supply will give the company a
total of 4500, which the management thinks
ought to answer all needs for some time
to come. Each car weighs 33,000 pounds
and will have a capacity of 100,000 pounds.
In regard to the movement to form a
freight equipment pool Mr. Kruttschnltt
said the project hnd been discussed In rail
road circles for several years and -while In
some particulars It might be a good thing
there were, nevertheless, many reasons
apalnst the formation of such an associa
tion. The chief difficulty would be sur
rendering to a central management the
handling of the equipment. It would cause
clash and confusion and the cars could not
be got to a desired point as readily as
they are now by |ach company's own
equipment management."
The engines ordered Include eighteen
passenger locomotives, six consolidation
mountain engines and twenty moguls.
Mr. Kruttschnltt returned from, his
Eastern trip yesterday. He went to Gal
veston snon after the flood to attend to
the reconstruction of the Southern Pa
cific's damaged road. Mr. Kruttschnltt
says the newspapers have not overesti
mated the fearful devastation 'of property
that has been wrought In the Texas city.
The loss of life, he thinks, will never be
accurately estimated. Whole families
and relatives were swept along with the
tide and there are no survivors to mourn
or even chronicle their loss. He says the
'pluck, perseverance and. determination
of the survivors are wonderful. They are
resolved to rebuild their city and to attain
this end they are working lndefatlgably.
Mr. Kruttschnltt says the generous con
tributions of a sympathetic nation nre not
unappreciated by the people of the strick
en city and none too much money can
be sent to assist In the work of rebuilding.
The Southern Pacific's loss was not as
great as at first supposed. Eighteen miles
of, road were swept from the river bank
and the bridge across Galveston Bay was
destroyed. '
NEW RAILROAD CORPORATION.
Road Twenty-Six Miles Xong for
Nevada and Si^ra Counties.
The Boca and LoyaltR Is the name of a
new railroad corporation just formed and
which will do business In Nevada and
Sierra counties In this State. Grading for
the new line Is now well under way and
the promoters expect to have the road
In oi>eratton this fall. :-.*-_
A single track, broad gauge will be built
and the trains will be operated cither by
steam or electricity. The articles of in
corporation, which have just been filed,
call . for a line twenty-six miles long, be
ginning at the town of Boca and continu
ing to a point two miles east of the pre
sent town of Loyalton, where a station to
be known as Roberts will be built.
The rood will pass â¢ through a rich tim
ber district and It Is the plan of the pro
moters to cut a good deal of this timber,
W. S. Lewis and R. H. Lewis, vice presi
dent and secretary, respectively, being
There are other minor matters for the
board to look Into, but Its report will
cause a shake up that will perhaps clear
the atmosphere about the old warship.
As for the crowding of the ship on
Saturday night, September 8, there was
no doubt but that there were more people
aboard than should have been there, but
the ship had been turned over. to the Gov
ernor and his staff, and they were privi
leged to take aboard as many as they
pleased. Some few Invitations were sent
around among the men, but not one-third
of them were used, and 'when any man
of the Marion's crew came down , to the
wharf In uniform' he was not "allowed to
go aboard. In the tugs for the Governor's
parties, and bo he did not go at all. As a
consequence there were not men enough
aboard to handle the crowd.
In the case of the naval militia this must
Include tho maintenance of the Marlon.
The Marlon lies out In the stream and It
was the Judgment of Captain James that
she should have an officer of rank con
stantly on board and In charge. For some
weeks the plan of detailing an officer of
the reserve to a week's tour of duty
aboard was tried, but as the officers could
not leave their business ashore, their time
of usefulness was' limited to the noon
hour each day. Then It was decided that
the boatswain of the organization, Rich
ard Schnalle, himself an old seaman and
captain and owner of numerous bay
schooners, should be detailed to the per
manent charge of the vessel at the lowest
navy pay of his rank, $75." He was assign
ed to tho duty, but the division command
er refused to pay him. Since' the vessel
Is in the stream she must have a compe
tent man In charge, for the danger of get
ting adrift or being fouled by passing
vessels Is ever present. â¢ She is Invoiced
to the State at several hundred
thousand dollars, and should anything
happen to her the State would
have to make It good to the
Government. This, too, will be made the
subject of the Inquiry.- There are six men
allowed by tho Government to look out
for the ship â a fireman, a cook, a second
class boatswain's mate, a cockswain and
two seamen. â¢ When the vessel is In the
stream, however, . the fireman must run
the engines of the, launch and the cock
swain must steer her, taking two men off
tho deck.' The" cook has his own work at
the galley; there must be one of the men
from' the deck In the flreroom to keep
fcteam for tho dynamo", and the other men
have, all they can do to stand watch. In
view of this state of affairs the employ
ment of the boatswain was considered
justifiable, and It was sanctioned by Major
General Dickinson.
BOARD WILL INVESTIGATE
AFFAIRS OF NAVAL MILITIA
Requested by Captain James
: to Settle Existing
Difficulties.
Will Adjust the Finances and Will
Inquire Into the Discipline and
Â¦ - ' Attendance of the Hen
and Officers.
.At the request of Captain N. T. James,
commanding the Naval Militia of Califor
nia, a board of Inquiry has been ordered
by the Governor to Investigate the affairs
of . that- organization. In his request for
the appointment of the court Captain
James asks that it inquire Into what Is
necessary, for the proper care and mainte
nance of the Marlon, the Naval Reserve
ship, and what provisions If any have
been made for- furnishing 'the same. Also
as to the discipline and attendance of the
officers and men of the different divisions.
' Since the. Marlon, hauled out Into the
stream there has been trouble, and It has
come to a. focus because of "the differ
ences of opinion regarding the expenses of
the . ship, irritated by the happenings of
the 9th of September celebration- week
and . the chanres and counter charges
brought by., officers against" each other,
same through proper channels and others
through the press. . ' /...!â
. The real -trouble began with the relief
of Lieutenant Commander Nerney as ex
ecutive officer of the Marlon, at his own
request; His request for reinstatement
came to headquarters two weeks before
the out of town divisions were to arrive
on board the Marion. His application
was forwarded from headquarters with
out approval for various reasons, among
them being that to make any change In
the existing rank or" duties of the officers
at a time when the arrangements for the
reception for 200 or more reserve men
were under way would be to mix the
whole plan, of arrangement and risk its
success. It was stated, at division head
quarters that the application would not
be passed upon until after the Native
Sons' celebration. Action on the' applica
tion h?s not yet been taken.
The trouble among the divisions is' of a
different character. It. is one of the pay
ment of bills. By . the State law. each
company of the National Guard is allow
ed }300 a quarter for iu maintenance, and
gun to go off.

v The Paris Exposition is a very remark
able presentation of the effect of the in
dustries of the world. The German expo
sition, in my opinion. Is the best examplr
of the capacities of a nation. Its display
shows that they understand the varied
things that the people of the earth want,
and, what is more, they know how to
make them. In scientific discoveries the
Germans stand first. In liberal arts they
"In machinery, in so far as the coarse
manufactory is concerned, the Chicago
exhibit was superior, but its superiority
ends there. Paris excels In the display
of Jewelry, tapestry, laces and fine arts.
"In Paris things are grouped together
under one head. It is difficult to find just
what you are looking for. The classifica
tion is Incongruous, as It were.
"The exposition," said Mr. Mills, "is in
some respects the greatest exposition ever
held. The question has not infrequently
been asked me. 'How does it compare
with the Chicago fair?' I answer that
things that are unlike cannot be com
pared. The Chicago buildings were more
commodious and better adapted to the
uses made of them. The buildings, too,
were more artistic and nobler architectur
ally. Comparing the classification, the
Chicago exposition was also superior.
road's exhibit there, returned to
this city last evening. Mr. Mills' train
was five hours late, and although very
much fatigued he graciously consented to
an interview. Mr. Mills Is tuthuslastic on
what this State has accomplished at the
big exposition, and says that tho superior
display is admired and commented upon
not only by Pjrisians. but by all nations
of the world. In only one particular did
he find that any other nation had out
done California in respect to its natnra!
resources. Mr. Mills discovered that the
Servian walnut was superior to any of
California's wnlnuts. and in ordor that
Servia should not again outdo California
he obtained a number of the nuts and will
pee that they are added to this State's
product hereafter.

of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, who went to Paris last
spring to take charge of the rail-
also occupy the front rank..
"From my observations it was apparent
to me that we are not In the future at
liberty to determine what our national
policy is to be. I believe the time is corn-
Ins -whfn European nations will combine
to influence our tariff legislation. I could
see that the different countries were
adapting themselves to the wants of the
other countries. They seem to know just
what the world wantsâ it don't make any
difference what country, Japan, Siberia
or Alaskaâ they know the needs of that
country and endeavor to supply the wants
there.
"Now I pay we must take care of our
commercial relations or we will become a
hermit nation. Whatever policy the world
adopts we must adopt a counter, policy.
The United States doesn't appear at its
best In the Paris Exposition. There is
apparently no high intelligence at^he
head of affairs. We had no chemical pro
ducts displayed and In this particular line
we are known to excel. We have a mis
erable, poverished exhibition of iron and
steel." t
Mr. Mills says he has lost faith in the
significance of gold and silver medals. He
lound that out of 7o,o31 exhibits there
have been 42.790 medals given out In ad
dition to 50,000 diplomas, so it is not al
ways merit that Is honored by medals.
Mr. Mills, like others who have been to
the exposition, does not speak very kindiy
of the treatment shown Americans In
Paris. The hotel rates were extraordinary
and the restaurant prices exorbitant up
to within a month ago when the owners
discovered that it would b,e to their ad
vantage to keep the rates down. For a
time the high rates kept many people
away. During the latter part of July and
the first of August the daily attendance,
dwindled down to only 105,000, which was
about 300.0(X> less than the daily average
anticipated by the management. Cali
fornia's exhibit, Mr. MillS says, has at
tracted more than the- average amount of
attention.
"California has depended largely upon,
her own uatural resources In its exhibi
tion," paid Mr. Mills, "and the State has
shown beyond any question that tho
whole world cannot duplicate it."

WRIT IS ISSUED
FOR ARREST OF
ALEX. McKENZIE
Paul Corcoran, one of the strikers, was
convicted of murder In the second degree
in the State court of Idaho and sentenced
to elKhteen years' imprisonment in the
penitentiary. His case is now on appeal
to the United States Supreme Court.
"The judgment is reversed and the cause
remanded, with Instructions to quash the
indictment and discharge the defendants."
Judge Gilbert said that the indictments
failed to allege that the defend
ants knew that, the train which they
prized was carrying United States mails.
"While it is true," continued Judge Gil
bert, "that the laws make the railways of
the United States postal roads for carry
ing the mall. It Is nevertheless true that
many passenger trains do not carry the
mail. The defendants in this case are not
charged with the overt act of obstructing
the passage of the mails or of a carrier
of the malls, but with conspiracy. It is
no offense against the United States to
hinder and delay the passage of a railway
car, and consequently it is no offense to
conspire for that purpose. Such an offense
must be dealt with under the laws of the
State. The conspiracy as charged in the
indictment lacks an essential ingredient
of an offense against the United States, to
wit, that the defendants knew that the.
mails of the United States were carried
upon that train which they conspired to
obstruct. It may be that they all had
such knowledge, or that the facts and cir
cumstances shown in the evidence were
sufficient to charge them with such knowl
edge, but that does not dispense with the
necessity of setting forth in the Indict
ment all the elements of the wrongful act
which they conspired to commit.
The facts of the case form one of the
thrilling episodes of the great Coeur
d'Alene strike of a year ago. On April 29,
1S99, a train of the Northern Pacific Rail
way was boarded by armed strikers be
tween the stations of Burke and Wallace.
These men took possession of the train.
When the train reached Wallace some of
the strikers compelled the engineer to run
his train over the track of the Oregon
Railroad and Navigation Company to
"Wardner Junction, twelve miles west of
Wallace, where the strikers destroyed the
works of the Bunker Hill and the Sullivan
Mining and Concentrating Company. A
large number of the strikers were arrest
ed and indicted for conspiracy for having
seized and Interrupted a train bearing
United States mails. The Circuit Court ot
Appeals based its decision upon the cases
of the United States vs. Carll. and Petty
bone vs. the United States. Carll was
Indicted for passing counterfeit money,
and the Indictment was held to be void
because it failed to allege that the defend
ant knew the coin to be counterfeit. Pet
tybone was arrested for his connection
with a boycott in violation of an injunc
tion of the United States District Court.
The case was dismissed because the com
plaint did not allege knowledge on Petty
bone's part of the process of the court.
United States Circuit Judges Gilbert,
Ross and Morrow, sitting as the United
States Circuit Court of Appeals in this
city, yesterday gave a decision that will
cause jrreat rejoicing: among the Coeur
d'Alene miners. The decision, which was
written by Judge Gilbert, releases from
the San Quentln penitentiary Denn!s
O'Rourke, â¢ who is under a sentence of
twenty months' imprisonment and J1C00
fine, and nine other miners serving a
sentence of twenty-two months' imprison
ment and $1000 fine each for conspiracy to
obstruct the United States mails.
Indictments Fail-d to . State That
Prisoners Knew That Train

States Mail.
