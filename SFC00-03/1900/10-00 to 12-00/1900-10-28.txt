HIS NATURAL CONCLUSION
A young. bachelor met a friendâ * mar
ried mat>â and poured out- his tale of wm
in something like this: ; v .'*.-..Â¦
. "I say. old chip. I'm up against It// TÂ«Â»

j and. of course. 1 wanr to make hÂ«r some
sort of present. -To - tell.- you the truth.; I

just : now 1* fa beggarly $10. g Now. if you'll

The married man was not flush Itfmsel!
just then, but a,* he knew hLs t riend Â¦ was
.all .right and 'really wished Â«o do him. a
favor, he said: 1 - .-.:- .
"I haven't the money si bout me. but I'll

there and. see. the buckle.: I'll ouy it and
have it "charged; to my account a^il you
can hand me the' J25 any time before the
first of the month, when the' bill- will lÂ»e
rendered." .
-This scheme worked to a charm.^ The
young man with the "best girl" was de
lighted and the buckle was carried off in
triumph. That would have been the end
of the episode, doubtless, had not the wife
of the -lender, got hold of the bill during
the absence of her husband on a business
trip. Judge of his consternation upon re
ceiving a telegram in these words: â¢ .
"Come home at once.. 1 know all."
. Taking, the fast train, he reached the
city, took a cab to ride home and. dashing
upstairs three steps at a time-, he entered
hi:; bedroom and found his wife in tears
while engaged in packing her trunk.
"You wicked, deceitful wretch!'/, she ex
claimca between sobs. "Who would have
believed that you would have deceived me
hi this way? I am going home to m-mo

about the hussy! Look, here is'the bill
for the prold belt buckle you bought her!
To think that it'should ever come to thâ
this â boo-hoo-hoo."
Then followed the copious tears., and
sobs. When* the wife's grief had about
spent itself, in tears, the husband got an
opportunity, to explain, but.it took re
markable eloquence and an abundance of
caresses to straighten matters out.
"But wasn't it a narrow escape?" said
he as he detailed the story. - "Everything

8court circles. Tier movements were as
ceremoniously recorded In the papers as
those of the Kaiser himself. My slater
and I often wondered about this famous
countrywoman of ours. From a rollab.lt -
source we learned of her first marriage "
Prince Frederick of Schleawlg-Holsteln-
Sonderburg-Augustenburg met and fell
in love with an . American girlâ Mary
Esther Lee. lie first saw her in a hotel in
Paris. I Ho was old, but ardent, and wooed
her with a.. persistency that won consent.
As a member of a German sovereign
house he could only marry *ah 'American,.
not "born" in German law, ilnder one of I
two conditions.
There could have been a morganatic
marriage, perfectly legitimate, but In
which the wife and children can have no
share In the husband's rank and its ap
purtenances.
Or the Prince could abdicate both name
and rank and wed the American girl on
terms of equality.
Mary Esther Lee would not listen to r. .
morganatic marriage. So Prince Freder
ick of Schleswig-Holsteln-Sonderburg-
Augustenburg consented to have all theso Â¦
high-sounding Hoch Deutsch titles am
putated and become plain Heir Frederick.
j IJut this did not suit the ambitious Amer
ican girl. It was not that she loved roy
alty less, but that she wanted to share it
more..
On September 24, 1E6J, Herr Frederick,
vho had duly made his renunciation, re
ceived for himself and his future . wife
Austrian collation of the title of Prlnco
Of Noer, and as .such he was married in
the following November. Emperor Fran
cis Joseph bestowed the title upon them '
because of the irresistible persuasive
powers of this charming American'
woman. Many American girls have
wonâ or boughtvtitled husbands, but
the Princess of Noct is the only one who
ever had the title of Princes3 in her own
right.
When Prince Noer died, shortly after
their marriage, he left his American brlds
his fortune, valued at $4,000,000. It was
r.ot until ten years later that she mar
ried the Count yon Waldersee. This and.
the fact that the Countess was "one of
the celebrated Lees of Virginia," was
practically all tho information wo'
gleaned about the mos't powerful womaa
In the German empire.
Some months after our Interest had flrst
been awakened in her we saw the Coun
tess dining with the Empress. It was our
day for writing home, and my sister Ger
trude in a letter to my aunt gave a llttlo
rketch of this famous American who is
without honor in her own land. Imaglna
cur surprise when we received the follow
ing answer. I quote, directly from my
aunt's letter, which I have saved:
"My dears, I am sure you are mistaken
about the Countess von "Waldersee. ShÂ«
does not belong to the Lees*of Virginia if
she is the Mary Esther Lee who married ,Â¦
a Prince. somebody or other. â¢"**. *Vlf :
my memory does not fair me she re
ceived the title of Princess of Noer or
some such name.
"1 had a letter from her at the time, but
It was destroyed In the fire. Tes. my dear
nieces, your aunt was once a very dear
friend of this Countess von Waldersee.
But she was plain Mar}' Lee then, and we
lived in neighboring houses here in New
York City. What gay frolics we hava
had together as children and how long ago
It all seems. â¢ Mary Lee must be near 60
nowâ you see I cannot call her the Coun
tess von Walderseeâ she is Jyst Mary Lee

"She was a little dictator even In those
days.' and ruled us all with an iron hand.
They were people of gome mean3, her â¢
father^ being a wholesale grocer... '
-"There. were-iwo' other gr'lrls in the fam- â¢'Â¦
Ily." The father died when they were all
quite young, and Mrs. Lee went to Stutt
gart to live and educate her children.
They were accounted wealthy then, but '"Â¦
It would be a very modest sum Indeed' In V
these days of gigantic fortunes.
' "I corresponded with Mary for years,'

MISS MARIAH" WATTS of
-
San. Francisco is one of very
few American girls who lias
visited the Countess von
Waldersee. It is claimed that many
of the high, honors earned by General
von "Waldersee, now in command of
the allied forces in China, is due to
the tact of his American wife. Tha
Countess von Walderseo is bo influ
ential with the Emperor and Empress
that she is often called "the powef
behind tho German throne."
It is not generally known that shs
is an American girl 'whose father was
a HÂ«w York grocer. The Countess
von Waldersee has been twico mar
ried â the first time, to a prince who
gave up his original title to wed her,
but received from the Emptror of
Austria the title of Prince of Noer.
The Countess von Waldersee is ac
counted the most ambitious woman
( in Europe, and does not lack Yankee
push and perseverance to further
her plans. Her influence with Em
peror William is stronger than that
of any bearded diplomat in the realm.
It is easier to meet Queen Victoria
than the Countess von Waldersee.
Very few Americans have had the
honor, and, indeed, very few of 'thsm
know that this extraordinary woman
is an American*
Miss Watts was accorded the priv
ilege owing to family friendship and
she has written on account of her
meeting with Countess von Waldsr- .

f=a'ERLIN', Sept. 12.â I have visited
j=sk the "power, behind the German
JL^y throne." Â»'
For that Is tbe way the Germans
epeak of the Countess von Waldersee.
Now that the eyes of the world are
focused on China, Count von Walderseo.
the commander-in-chlef of the allied
forces, naturally gets the lion's share of
personal interest. . Here In Berlin the
Count von Waldersee Is overshadowed by
a more powerful personality. It It the
Countess von Waldersee, whose every
word Is awaited with breathless Interest; '
whose every movement Is watched.
And the Countess von Walderseo Is an
American woman. Just ponder over that
for a znoment.
The daughter of a New York grocer, she
has twice married Into tha nobility. Her
first husband relinquished the title of
Princ* of Schleswig-Holstein In order to
marry her. By this marriage she is a
grand aunt of the Empress of Germany.
Her first diplomatic move was to per
suade the Emperor, Francis Joseph, to
give her husband the title of Prince of
Noer. This madÂ© her a Princess in her
own right.
TbÂ« Prince of Noer died, leaving her his
vast fortune. Ten years later the widowed
Princess Noer married Count von Walder
see.
She. became the personal advisor of the
Emperor and Empress of Germany.
She helped crueh the power of Bismarck.
Her- Influence brought about Count von
Waldersee's appointment as chief of the
allied forces in China.
These are a few of the things which
this da.ugb.ter cf an American grocer has
accomplished. Small wonder that she Is
considered the cleverest and most auda
ciously ambitious woman in all Europe.
Bzsa.ll wonder that It - Is tbe ambition of
every American girl In Germany to be re
ceived by her.
I think, however, that.I may safely say
that very few American Women have en
joyed the rare privilege of meeting Coun
tess von Waldersee. You must disen
tangle a labyrinth of red tape to get at
the "power behind the German thrcne."
I flret saw the Countess von Waldersee
at the last musical festival arranged in
honor of Emperor William's, birthday.
As a pupil In the KoenigHcbe Hochschule
(conservatory of music) I was a member
of the orchestra. At the right of the
Empress cf Germany sat a dlsynguished
looklcg elderly lady. "The Countess von
Waldersee," some one whispered as the
royal party were leaving.
In the "pension" where we were then
living there were few other Americans-
French and Germans for the most part.
The festival was freely discussed at sup
per. An interrogation about the Countess
von Waldersee brought an avalanche of
information which swrpt all other topics
before it. "Not know the Countess!" and
the French looked Incredulous; and the \<
Germans reproachful. Then they pro-^
ceeded In Franco-Prussian to tell us -all *!
they knew about" the, Countess; the French
Civing one version of her life and the Ger
mans another, and both talking at tbe

at all foreign boarding bouses, as time

to vest the people we wish to help with
the first essential to their happiness â self
respect. By giving work to unfortunates
who are under a severe stress we hope
to tide them over that critical period of
helplessness and put them on their feet.
Philanthropy Is an art. Give a man
money and it does not nelp him. Gener
ally it does him harm, for in accepting
It he loses his self-esteem, and that once
gone he begins to be a beggar. By giving
him the opportunity to earn enough to
tide him over his difficulty you put him on
his merits and give him a start; he re
tains his own respect and feels like a
man among men. My experience In the
Red Cross work has , taught me many
things, and this among them. I think It
Is the very center of the whole difficulty
In philanthropy.
Mrs. Arthur Cornwall, at the head ot
the Department of Social Science, Is re
Â¦ponslble for the prospective experiment.
The idea was suggested to her by the suc
cess of the Plngree potato patch plan
which some time ago attracted much at
tention in Detroit and Chicago. But Mrs.
Cornwall's Intention Is to broaden out up
on the original plan, extending the work
to the culture of flowers and vegetables
other than the potato. In this way a
greater profit Is expected. Inasmuch as
there will be a readier and more varied
market, besides a variety of occupations
furnished to those who seek work.
The potato patch plan Is under the aus
pftoes of the California Club and it Is to
be Inaugurated for the relief of the poor
and unemployed.
SAN FRANCISCO is to have a potato
patch. In fact, potato patches are
to be ETenerously sprinkled all over
the city. Vacant lots are to be met

sprouts, with a little family of the Joy of
Ireland at the root of each. Th'e man

meanwhile the people .who work and pre

Mrs. Lo veil White, president of the
California Club, heartily â¢ Indorses the
plan. "And it requires," says she, "soine
one of just Mrs. Cornwall' e energy and
spirit to carry It through.' It is no small
uadortakteg, but with Mrs. Cornwall at

/SEE no reason why the Pingree plan should not be success
ful in San Francisco. It ts certain that something must be
donejor the aid of the great army of unemployed in our
city, and the only practical way to help them is to help them to
help themselves. After careful consideration of the matter and
much investigation of the Detroit plan I suggested the matter to
the California Club. The idea met .with every . encouragement
from the members, , and wherever-' it ivas : mentioned hearty
co-operation was' proffered.'- Owner's of vacant lots throughout
the city have come to me and offered the of their property

the matter of help from their stock for seed potatoes, etc. With
this encouraging outlook we feel, secure in going on with the mat
ter. It zvill take a great deal of money before the plan is put
upon a self-supporting basis.' It is not a small undertaking, and
requires a great deal of thought. â¢!
There is such a very. great need for something of this kind
in San Francisco that the matter appeals to me very strongly,

It # Is a crucial time for them. If they
are furnished with work, so that they
may earn enough to take them * away
from the scene of their disgrace. they
will survive it; but.. if unassisted, they

one undÂ£r a ban and become criminals.
Then there is the ppor soldier with his

women and weak men may find lighter
tasks among the flower lota, and they
will be paid according to their merits.
The social science department of. ' the
California Club is devoted to the relief
of distress among the poorer working

of the plan have proffered encouraging

know, is the yellow paper discharge,

stands for military disgrace. Once
I told a soldier who was brooding

he replied that he would keep It al

his paper Is bob-tailed. Those things are

of the census of 1900. The population is
now counted to the number of 60,000,000,
and Is still being canvassed at the rats
of 1.50O.C0O per day. A complete record
of every Individual In the United States

sus department, and a stroke of a collat
ing machine records accurately the twen

astic over the results. The'electrlo count-
Ing machines have even surpassed the pre
dictions of the Inventor, . Mr. Sholleway,
and each records 1200 names Instead of S00

from the British Government concerning
the methods of taking the American cen
sus, because It Has never been able to
secure such comprehensive data, or even
as complete a count of population. In tea
years of continuous work as the Ameri

With twenty-four potential facts concern-

logical and psychological problems of the

With all these basic facts at hand, ac

seven robust, pretty daughters seemingly
does not know, when he Is blessed.

But although there Is now a son. the

to feed and clothe them and plenty of cas

The Archduke does not allow himself to

The many admirers, of the wiltlnRs of

latest work, "The Plain Mi=Â« Cray." Not
that the story is uninteresting, but the
interest i3 of an entirely different nature
from that arou?ed by her earlier works.
Her style a'nd methods also show nxuch
change. The scene In -the present novel
Is laid in Ireland and tho motif of the
plot as well as the characteristics of sev
eral of the actors therein btars a eoine
vrhat remarkable resemblance to the
novels cf "The Duches3 ' (the late Mrs.

A house party Is crathored together in
"the wildest part of a wild Irish county. '

mother of the absent owner of the es

nishes the title for the story.
The other dramatis personae follow
each other in rapid successionâ a ragged
and surly gardener, an old and disagree
able brother-in-law of the hostess; a Lon

a large fortune; the "Lord of the Manor,"
with an unlooked for and unwelcome
bride; an impecunious Irish baranet whose
ancestors were king's In the good old days;
and, last of all, the villain, who Is a cold
blooded desperado and a fugitive from
Justice.
The curtain rings up, the play begins,
and the spectators will noon discover that
the plot, if not entirely new. Is sufficiently
Intricate to hold the Interest in It to the
end. One episode will be found especially
enjoyableâ that wherein the hitherto

and his sister Kate, who, by an unhappy
combination of events, are thrown upon
their own resources and compelled to
make their own^way in the world.. Roger
tells his own story In a modest, manly
way that boys, and girls, both. will, be
charmed with, and that their parents will
admire equally. . With hia> father thrown
into prison on a serious charge Roger
finds that few people will have anything
to do with either himself or' his sister,
and the Jeers flung at him at times are
almost more than he ean bear. But he Is
"true to himself! In the best meaning of
that saying, rising . above those who
would pull him down. By a curious com
bination of circumstances he is thrown in
contact with those' who wronged his fa

Influence will find much food for thought
In a book which has recently appeared
whose author Is the well-known lecturer
on heredity, psychology, psychic phenome
na, brain building and soul growthâNev.'
ton N. Riddell.
Mr. Riddo'l has made a personal study
of the heredity and psychology of some
thirty-five thousand personsâ criminal and
depraved as well as men of geniusâ and
has been a favorite lecturer for many
year? at the summer Chautauqua- assem
blies. In addition, he gives at the begin
ning of ihe present volume a formidable
list of authorities consulted which should
show that he has been a close student of
his subject through the eyes and thoughts
of others, as well as by his own personal
observation. The liook Is written in a pop
ular style and is intended as a practical
treatise within the comprehension of all.
He says:
"I have endeavored to reduce the known
facts and laws, of reproduction to a defi
nite science and present them in a non
technical, concise form, hoping thereby to
enable thoughtful parents to apply these
laws to the lmorovement of their off

understanding instead of prejudice and
tells :you what he sees, irrespective of
whose feelings may bo hurt. Â¦

From the dedication, which is the only
jrr?face, one infers that the volume Is
published partly ' n answer to a request
from a friend for "a few more queer
etories from the Japanese." Of the s'.x
short t ran slat ion.< in the first collection,
called "Stories frum Strange KoÂ«>ks." four
of them are equal to any of the Oreek
myths and will take their place in dema
theiFra of tho Ka*t when it comes to be
finally completed, if ever. The first of
Cbese, "The Reconciliation." tells of a
man v.-h-j divorced a loving wife in that
easy and reasonless v.ny, which is thv;
strangest part of Japanese social cus
tom. He marries again only to find that
1t was a. true love which he cast away,
ar.d for years he lives through the tor
tures of pelf-condemnation and enforced
delay, waiting the time when he can re
turn and ma'-te amends. The reconcilia
tion takes place in the house where they
had lived so happily. The wife is there
In the midst of the wrecked and molder

years. She welcomes him and playfully
stops his self-chiding. Happily they pass
the night recalling the old days, planning
the new. and when the morning light
comes he find* but the duet of the years
covering a mass of rags and bones and
hair, all that was left of the beautiful
girl who had died for her grief.

Merely because he had faith.
There is a moral in it. though, and a
lesson to be pondered, unless you prefer
Jr.stea.d <;f pondering to go on and read the
ftory of "'The Screen Maiden," which is
one of the very numerous Eastern legends
of the rlass from which "Pygmalion and
Galatea" wa* drawn. The screen maiden
was eo beautifully painted on her silken
background that an ardent youth fell in
love with her &ud by the very strength of
hie devotion brought her to life, and the
Incarnated picture promises to be his not
only lor life, which is as far as our lim
ited religion permits us to belong to each
other, but for rlx more existences after
ward â only with this limitation, the pict
ure girl tells him that if he is ever cross
to her she will at otiee t-tep back into the
screen. Not a bad idea if it could be put
in practice, eltaer.
.'The Sympathy of Benten" is one of the
rrctticst conceptions in the book. It Is
the =tory cf a young man who falls in love
with the writer of some beautifully in
scribed vtxpes. She appears to him
through the miriFtrations of the Goddess
IJentcn. who has nothing to do but attend
to the yearnings of lovers. They live Ijap
pfly together without further assistance
until one day the young man finds that It
is only the soul of his wife which he has

â¢This New Year's morning I find upon
my table two .most welcome "gifts from a
young poet of my literary class. One Is a
roll of cloth for a new kimonoâ cloth 'such
as my Western reader never saw. The
brown warp is cotton thread, but the. woof
Is eoft white paper, string, irregularly
epeckled with black. When closely exam
ined the black specklings prove to be Chi
nese and Japanese characters, for the
paper woof is made out of the manuscript
of poems, which has been deftly twisted
into fine cord with the written surface
outward. The general effect of the black,
v.-hitc and brown in the mixture Ik a warm
mouse-gray. In many Izumu homes a elm- j
liar kind, of cloth is manufactured for
family use. but this piece was woven
c*p?c:aIJy for me by the mother of my.
pnpll. It will mane a most comfortable
winter robe, and when wearing It I shall
be literally clothed with poetry, even as
t divinity might be clothed with the sun."

apples having very short stems. These
are to be picked out by the teeth and
each person present must secure an apple
in that manner before being qualified to
take part in the performances of the
evening.
In every circle of friends there is al
ways one at least with a home built on
the old-fashioned plan as far as big rooms
and fireplaces go. In such a house
Halloween frolics should be held and the
closer the dressing of the guests ap
proaches to that of the old-time "neigh
bors," who dropped In at the farmhouse
of an evening, the more of a success the
party will be.
In order to take the "new" off any
people who feel themselves under con
straint, it is usual to have a candy pull
In the early part of the evening to provide
sweets for those who care to eat them,
but more for the purpose of getting ac
quainted and establishing a general ac
cord without which even the best lal-1
plans of host and guest must all fall flat.
An old country cerem.ony for divining
future fate of a couple was for them to
go together to the cabbage garden, both
blindfolded, and pull the first cabbage
stalk that came in their way; its being
big or little, straight or crooked, was
prophetic of the size or form of the future
husband or wife of the one pulling it.
Divining by water was another. Let
three small dishes be placed before the
blindfolded interrogator of fate. In one
put pepper-sauce, in another vinegar ami
in the third eau sucre. The blindfolded
person then puts out his hand after tho
plates have been shuffled and dips a linger
Into one of them. The taste of the. linger
will Indicate what manner of disposition
will belong to the life companion whom
fate Is going to award.
Melons belong especially to this festival
evening, both as a contribution to the
menu and as a means of interpreting the
future. A melon Is cut Into seven pieces,
and a spoonful of seeds is served with
each piece. The seeds are then spread
upon the plate and taken before the god
mother, Â¦who, with her wand, counts them
out,, repeating the following lines;
"One will be wealthy, two will be healthy
Three will seek fortune and fame,
Four will grow stingy, five will look dlngj
Six will secure a good name.
But seven elves a lover that's true."
This Incantation goes on until the flna\
number has been reached, and that set
tles the fortune of the one to whom the
melon .belongs.
While palmistry is not really a part of
the original Halloween games it has
come to take an important place among
them and if there are any present. who
have a sufficient understanding of It to
make Interesting readings from the palms
they will 'find their time occupied from
beginning to end. To make the affair
more- mysterious *and .at the same time
truly test the power . of the reader, a
heavy pair of portieres should be so hung
that the hand, to be read may be passed
through between Â¦without the palmist see
ing the person to -whomvit belongs. Â¦ It
will be well for him to explain, though,
that he Is under the influence of one ; of
the spirits of the evening, so that, if any
of his forecasts' are not acceptable the
blame shall not lie upon him.
There is one performance of Halloween
which is often practiced by the people of
the fishing villages on the British coasts.
It is to catch a - llsh at any time after
dark on Halloween and cook and. eat it
the first thing after, midnight.; - This is
said to assure every. "one who tastes of
the fish of all sorts of good luck for. the
entire year 'following. " 'Â¦''â¢'â¢'
It is well to PURgest that all guests

rection. A small "Japanese paper lantern
with sand placed in , the bottom around
the candle and slung upon a short wand

to each person to carry, upon arrival. The
combination of these lights with the weird
sameness of the white costumes will make
a scene that will not be soon . forgotten,
and add greatly to â¢ the success of thi
evening, which is usually ; one , that willj
live in the memory of every participant. .

" Halloween Is the ghosts* holiday, the
one night when they have leave to wan
der through our fancies.
Times have been more humfirim since
the shadow people have been banished
from our life by the smatterings of Â«cl
Â«:ee which are just enough to make ur
unbelievers, and now we have to travel so
far away in search of adventure that It
loses its charm in the seeking.
Time was. not so very long aero, Â¦when
respectable citizens could go out any dark
night and within three squares of the!r
home see enough "things" to stock the
chamber of horrors in a museum. Now
we travel around the world with no more
change of sensation than you may get for
10 cents on a motcr car and ferry-boat
trip.
The night of the Slst of October will
give a chance to welcome back the ghosts
that send the chills creeping over us, but
there must be proper incantations per
formed to give them welcome: for ghosts
are ceremonious and do not appear nor
even manifest their presence if they are
extended only the ordinary "come In" of
welcome, which suffices in bidding a mor
tal to enter.
Here are some of the ways In which
they may be brought to appear.
If a young lady will go alone to a dark
room, carrying a dim taper, and there eat
an apple while she sits before a mirror
brushing her hair, and glancing over her
left shoulder at short Intervals; before the
last tangle is unraveled the face of her
future spouse will have been seen.
More sure than this, if not too fearsome
fand who would be afraid when so much
5s at stake), is for a maid to go all alone
to a well or 6pring. or If none Is conve
nient then to the nearest pond or river,
and bending over the bank to repeat the
following lines:
Fairies, in this mystic place
Show isy future true love's face.
6o that when we meet, perchance.
1 ehali know hlrn at a glance.
(This to bÂ« three time* repeated.)
For the success of this charm it Is ab
solutely neceseary that the young lady
ehould go unattended and that she may
safely do. for the fairies will protect her
from all harm until she returns.
Other charms which may be tried with
out going out alone are more numerous.
One of them Is to suspend a hoop horizon
tally by a stout cord from the ceiling:.
To this are tied short bits of thread,,
pieces of candies, bread, red pepper and
candle ends. Start the hoop whirling
arourd sideways, grasp at the objects
with your teeth and the taste of the first
bite will give you knowledge of what
your future married life will be or wnat
the future has in store for you If already
married.
What should properly be made the firat
entertainment of the evening is "the nut
tree." Any kird of a. tree will serve,
though a real nut tree Is better. Xuts of
all kinds in good quantity should bt
loosely fastened on the branches. All of
the young ladies present then gather un
der the tree and it is shaken vigorously
to cause the r.uts Xo fall. The girl wlio
catches the most Is declared fairy god.^
mother of the evening. If it is not con
venient to arrange the nut tree the nuts
may be tossed in the air by hand i dozen
at a time and scrambled for.
To tell fortunes bv nuts two of , them
are placed together or a fire shoyel and
placed over tho coals; the name of a boy
is given to one and a Rlrl's name is given
to the other. As thev burn cuietly to
gether or pop and Jump away from each
o:her bo will be the oourtshlp of tho two
for wbcm they are ncmed.
Apples are a very important part of
Halloween. They should be large and
rosy, for the red apple is symbolic of love.
Cider made from apples is the proper
drink fcr the evening. It should be sweet
and in unlimited quantity, as no harm can .
result from the drinking If it Is fresh
made. Apples suspended from strings so
as to siring about freely may be bitten at
by the young gentlemen present and for
each bite of apple which they can secure
without using their hand by grabbing
with their teeth alone, they are entitled
to claim a kiss from any young lady ,
whom they manage to catch while still
holding the bit of apple in the mouth.
A tub full of water should also be placed
in tho middle of thÂ« floor and the top of
Party.

U in one corner a pen and Ink sketch of
a witch riding on a broomstick. Much
pains should be taken with thÂ» decora-

Cornstalks tied to tho banister should

heavy cord at the top and bottom hold

still they dragged their weary way
through the sinklnr sand, talking less and

heat was Intolerable; they were thirsty

nowhere in sight. Then he called his com

hours of the morning the tracks grew

The first thing to do with a sprain Is to
apply water as hot as can be borne and
repeat until the pain Is gone. The hot
water may be showered on the sprain or
wet cloths may be used If frequently re
newed. The foot or ankle can be conven
iently immTsed In thÂ» hot water. The
next thing Is to keep the Injured part
thoroughly warm. This Is done by wind-
Ing It with wadding or flannel. The less a
ppralned limb Is used, the quieter it la
kept, the more likely it is to get well
quickly.
Table oil or fresh butter rubbed imme

The most Important point In the treat

Is a safe and effective application. Do not
remove the dressing until the irritation
has subsided. In the country mothers

flour. In serious case3 a mixture of sweet
oil and molasses is favored. Vi^elina will

DAINTY SIDE DISHES FOR EPICURESthe efforts jt the training season have
been put fcrlh.
Aside from the stars, the greener or less
brilliant men are constantly getting
bruises and sprains and soon there would
be no second eleven to lino up for prac
tice if It were not for the efforts of the
trainer.
There Is another man with whom the
trainer doesn't always agree. That's the
team's physician. He generally wants to
send a man to bed to erow weak and
soft. Tho trainer wants to keep him up
bo that when his knee is well again he
will be In shape to go right Into the thick
of tho practice.
These are â¢ what make, the trainer's
knowledge and experience valuable In the
college, and the pa me difficulties, though
les-s emphasized, make the training of the
smaller high and preparatory school
teams a puzzling thing for, the boys that
have no trainer to direct them.
I began my football training career
with the famous old Reliance Club team
and in 'CC I trained the Stanford team.
In '97. 'OS and '93 I was trainer for the
Berkeley team. In that long experience
I may have learned some things that
will interest people who wonder how a
college team is trained, and which ought
to be of Fomo assistance to high school
boys who have no trainer.
The football season opens in the first
week of the college term and lasts until
Thanksgiving, when the team meets Its
greatest rival. Of course, at first the
practice Is very light and consists mainly
of punting and passing the ball, falling on
it, wrestling on mats In the gymnasium
and so on. with maybe a sharp run down
the field or an occasional slower cross
country run. All this is aimed at loos
ening up. the muscles of the boys who
ere muscle-bound . and to harden up the
muscles of those who come back soft
from vacation.
The boys that the colleges depend on to
win their football games as well as other
athletic contests are the boys from the
farms or mines or ehops, whose shoulders
are brawny and whose backs are strong.
These boys come to college, whether as
freshmen or after vacation, In good phys
ical condition. In my opinion, they ought
to be put at the training -table right from
the start, bo that unsuitable food should
have no chance to get In Its deadly work
and put them out of the running before
the season has fairly started.' Boarding
house pies and midnight "feeds" have
ruined many a promising man's stomach
* â ir-iVTO leading f.ictor3 enter Into the
preparation of a college football
li team for its final great etrugsle
â¢with Its chief rival for supremacy.
The work of the coach Is aimed at
teaching the players the game in all its
details and the development of team
Â¦work, tho only thing that will win in foot
ball.
The trainer's efforts are directed to
ward building up tho players physically
and grooming and to keep them at the
top notch of strength and energy.
While the work of the trainer dovetails
Into that of the coach and has the same
end in view, there Is a confiict between
coach and trainer that can't be avoided.
The training season lasts ten or eleven
weeks and it is none too short for the
coach. Not until the last two or three
weeks is he able to get his team to de-
Telop "varsity form," and after that
every day count?. So for six days in
the week during the long season of train-
Ing the coach Is hammering away at his
players, sending them against each other
like battering-rams. Instructing them in
Individual play and in lineup practice. AH
that is very hard on the player, because
he soon gets In fine fettle, and then the
trainer has to exert every effort to keep
him from going stale; that Is to say, from
becoming over-trained.
For eight weeks possibly the trainer
must watch the player as a physician
watches a fever patient. By changes of
diet or taklnz him out of the practice
for a few days he counteracts ar.y ten
dency to Btaleness. But the coach may
want that particular man In the practice
badly at that particular time, and unless
ho is a sensible fellow or the trainer's
authority In his own field is absolute,
there Is sure to be trouble.
That, then, Is the first and most trying
duty of -the football trainerâ to keep the
players from going stale. But there are
ether things which make his work diffi
cult. A favorite playerâ the quarter or
fullback or line-bucking half whose brill
iant play is counted upon to sqpre against
the rival teamâ goes down in a heap soxr,4
evening at practice and when the other
fellows get up he lies on .the ground
twisting In pain* from a sprained ankle or
a torn tendon or a twisted knee. The
trainer takes him in charge and assumes
the responsibility of getting the disabled
star back Into shape and doing it quick
ly. If he bungles, his mistake may cost
the college the game, to win which all
er a pint of ale occasionally at dinner.
Two weeks before the big game ealfj=foot
Jelly and sherry or sherry and egg is
given the men at breakfast to tone up the
system and allay nervousness. At night
a glass of vin mariani. or, if the player is
fine, an extra bottle of ale before going
to bed is good.
The trainer must exercise great care to
keep his men from becoming stale as a
result of the long training season. The
signs of stalene.Â«s are .dry- skin, hollow
eyes, loss of apnetlte. drowsiness, slow
ness in play. Staleness is just as fatal to
good play as a broken leg, only It is easier
tr remedy.
The player is kept out of regular prac
tice a few days, or at least eased up.
Often his diet is changed ami he is given
more ale. A man may be very "fine." and
a practice a little too hard may send him
over the line find ho will go all to pieces
from stalencss. Sometimes It Is necessary
to send a man away from the training
table and let him break all the training
rules as to diet. He 1b not allowed to
smoke, however.
The art of bandaging is one that the
football trainer, must acquire. There are
bruises and cuts got In every practice and
game that need care of that sort. More
serious than tiiese are sprains, partlcu
. larly of the knee. A player's knee Is bad
ly* wrenched, and without proper care
"water on the kr.ee" is the result. The
best treatment for a sprained knee Is a

Whether the players are boarded at a
training tablo or not, they must let all
fatty and starchy foods elone. Those
are fat producing, and the football man
has no use for fat. He must religiously
abstain from intoxicating liquors and
from tobacco In any form.
Intoxicants waste his strength and en
ergy, and any youth who can carouse,
or even drink moderately, and still play
good football can do a de'llof a sight bet
ter if he takes care of himself. If he
breaks training rules and yet is a star
on the team he can become a great col
lege hero if he will deny himself his In
dulgences and develop all there la In 'him.
The boy who smokes cigarettes . can
never be a great football player.' He can
not even hope to make, a' good' showing
on the practice field unless he ceases .the
habit while in training.
It is the worst form of the tobacco habit
and the boy who fills his lungs with, cig
arette smoke, who; 1 "inhales," is no more
good on the : football field than a wind-:"
broken horse on the . race track."
But I do not want to wink. at the crime
of cigar smoking during the training sea
son, A' well-seasoned player "with
strength and wind In perfect condition to
stand up to a grilling game, may go back
to his cigars ever so moderately, and in
a week it will cut his wind so badly that
he Is useless to his team after, ten min
utes of hard plny."\
The diet must be plain. At the training
table the meals are served about as.fol
lows:
Breakfastâ Mush, the kind used to be
varied from day to day; boiled or poached
eggs or lamb chops; milk. No tea or cof
fee is allowed the players. A cup ' of- hot
water before breakfast is insisted -upon.
Stewed prunes or apple sauce is on the
table at all meals. The football player
must give up hot biscuits, -and. in fact,
even fresh bread. Toast and once in a
while graham bread Is served at nil meals.
Lunchâ Roast beef, medium or rare,' as
the Individual likes '[ It; "baked potatoes;
celery, asparagus, tomatoes or a baked
apple; occasionally a" plate of. bouillon".
Dinnerâ A strong soup, either rice toma
to, cream celery or beef tea with an egg
In* it; 'porterhouse 'steak, roast beef 'or
chicken: lamb chops; vegetables; a light
pudding, such as corn starch. On' Sun
days turkey and ice cream Is served. ..'At
dinner, during ; the hard work aftep the
training season Â¦ Is ; well under way tie
before every practice, the bamlago being
taken off at the end of the play.
Sprained or weak ankles cause the play
ers and the trainer a world of trouble.
They are treated by being strapped with
one-inch adhesive tape. Three-fourths oZ
a spool is used per ankle. It, too, Is put
on before practice and taken off at its
close.
Of course, the dubs are not given such
good care. Only men of acknowledged
value to the t?im can be given such at
tention. Yet I tare often had two dozen
knee bandagM and as many ankle tapes
In use In a single game.
Muscle bruises, particularly on the
thighs and calves, are troublesome. Some
times it takes several days to get rid of
them. The muscle hardens and loses its
elasticity. Dry heat and mas3age is used
In treatment of them. #
Insignificant little scratches even mast
be given attention, for the football suits
at best are dirty and sweaty. Blood-poi
soning has to be guarded against.
Scratches and cuts should be washed
with a solution of lysol after every prac
tice. If there la any swelling the player
should be sent to the doctor at once.
All sprains and deep bruises are treated
by massage and the application of heat.
The massage is done with a kneading
motion and In hot olive oil. Simple rub
bing will not reach sprains and bruises.
Such Injuries should be massaged twice a
day. >'."Â¦,*
The men are allowed baths as they like
?hem, hot or cold, until tw^ weeks before
the game. Then It must be a cold shower
alone. No tub baths po after that.
All the players are rubbed down In the
course of the day. as they can be handled
by the trainer and rubbers.
As the time for the big game approaches
effort Is made to relieve the monotony of
practice. The men are taken on little out-
Ins trips and come back In the evening to
find the training table nicely decorated
;nda few friends present, maybe, to Jolly
them along.
So It Is on the night before the game.
None but the men who have mad" the
varsity or substitute are of any import
ance then, and each of those fortunate
ones Is watched with great sol!c\tude.
Some of the other college boys come to
the quarters and sin? a little or play the
piano, and at 10:30 o'clock the players are
sent to bed.
Generally they go to sleep without any
trouble, but often some of them are nerv
eus, and If they fall asleep they begin to
play the game over and over In their
dreams. A single night of such nervous
r.ess, If a man Is fine, may cause him to go
stale and be no good In the game.
Â¦ If the trainer finds a man awake or
restless he may talk to him a little or
give him a little ale. and by getting hi3
mind off the game gets him to- fall Into
sound sleep.
The meal before the game la served at
about 11:30 o'clock. It consists of chicken,
toast, peas, baked potatoes, boiled rlcs
and a glass of distilled water.
With such care men may be kept In the.
pink of condition, and whether the game
be easy or a grilling struggle, testing he
roically their powers of endurance, they
are ready to go to It.

Queer Flowers of F?efd and -Garden.-
Did you ever see a field of wild lark
ppur, â¢ with its rich colorsâ violet-purple,
deep blue, or white?' In the center of each
blossom the four petals form a little rab
bit, with ears , alert and listening. The
white" rabbit Is especially pretty, and no
one can fan to, notice the odd likeness of
the animal forni. .The colored leaves,
which seem to be a part of the flower, are
really, the sepals of the calyx. v
You. can also find; a lark in the flower
by pulling off all the sepals except two.
which are left for the bird's outspread
wings. The long spur, which runs back
ward, is the tapering body and long tail
of the lark. When I was a child It was
great pleasure to see my hidden bird
appear, as the unnecessary sepal* were
removed, and Jt was just in the graceful
act of flight from the stem!
Another flower of the same family, the
wild columbine, takes Its name from co
lumba, a dove, on account of the likeness
of the bright petalB to a group of doves
surrounding a water bowl. As soon as the
colored sepals are removed this likeness
is very obvious.
The snapdragon, one of the charming
flgworts.is another delightful flower to a
child, because he can open the gaping
Jaws of the dragon's m6uth and see Its
furry " tongue,' and ; the spots and . blotches
of color remind him of the leopard's spots
and the tiger's stripes. Â¦'" The beafd-tQPgue,
with Its swollen throat. Is one of. the
same grotesque group. The monkey-flower
has only to show Its odd, grinning blos
som to explain its Latin name, which
means a "little joker." or clown â rainrulus.
By the way, the pretty gold and purple
pansles display queer little monkey faces
In their open flowers, which seem to nod
and grimace with every passing breeze.
The turtlehead Is named from Its blosson,

the throat." which adds to its general
qucerness of look. The foxglove sounds
like a German fairy tale, with Master
Reynard concealing his paw In an elf
made clove. The monk's-blood also sug
gests a story, a bad one for the monks,
for If you look well under the dark blue
hood or cowl made by the calyx you will
discover, cunningly hid, two diminutive
hammer-like claw?, the only petals this
flower possesses.
The prettiest blossoms that mimic llfÂ»
are the bee, the butterfly and tho dove
orchid?, and the charming moth-mulleins,
clustered thickly with exquisite purple or
canary yellow, moth-shaped flowers,
ready to 'fly. They carry violet wool to
keep the !ns!de dry from rain, and this
rich tint, with the orange pollen, make
the central part of the blossoms as say as
a tropical butterfly.
The mouse-ear and the dandelion (the
lion's tooth) and the ragged robin also
suggest animal likenesses and. associa
tions, and many plants have seed vessel*
that are shaped like the beaked and tho
spurred foot' of a bird, as the hook-beaked
crowfoot, the cranesblll, or geranium,
from a Â¦ Latin word for crane, and many
others.- Like children, the early observers
of nature delighted in odd resemblances,
and made a kind of a fairy story of their
imperfect science.

that human life would average three of
four times longer than it does if people
"'ould reject the senseless practice -of

live much longer in proportion to the

Says Professor, Tyler: "Man, for rome

been separated from the body. In cook-
Ing food all the acids and gases so neces

trick all the same and ver- valuable in a
"One of the best offhand shots I ever
knew was a cowpuncher named BUI
Ralney. He attributed his skill to the
habit of laying his Index finger along the
barrel of the sixshooter. *I don't p'lnt the
gun.' he said; 'I Just' p'int my finger and
then let her go Gallagher!' There was
probably more in that practice than BUI
himself suspected. We are accustomed
from infancy to pointing at things wa
desire to indicate, and no doubt uncon
sciously cultivate the very sense of direc
tion of which you were speaking a ferÂ»
moments ago. I have seen Ralney knock
over an oyster can five times out of six
at a distance of over fifty feet without
doing a particle of sighting, and firing"
almost as quickly as he could pull tne
trigger. One, of his pet tricks was to
wheel and fire, and the accuracy with
which he could plant a bullet while his
body was still turning was marvelous.
One thing I noticed In particular m re
gard to shooting without taking aim alons
the barrel was that It must bÂ« done very
quickly, or the bullet Is almost certain to
fly wide of its mark. If there is any hesi
tation or attempt to calculate the direc
tion It Is safe to wager on a miss. ThÂ«
cowboy3 who were most expert at this
style seemed to find their target by a. sort
ot Instinct and pulled the trigger the
moment the arm was fully extended.
Aside from Billy Rainey and his index
finger theory I never encountered any
body who was able to throw any light
on the performance. When questioned
the cowpunchers would look bewildered

DEAD SHOTS WITHOUT
I've heard a good many stories
jj about 'hip shooting,' " said a veteran
Ii hunter of this city, "but I never saw
but one man who professed to be able
to do the trick. He was aphyslcian named
Webster, who' came from somewhere near
Charleston, S. C. I hunted' with him
twice at Asheville, and on each occasion
he gave some remarkable exhibitions of hl3
skill. He used an old-fashioned Parker
breechloader, 12-bore, and when he shot
from the hip he grasped the stock Just
behind the hammer with his right hand,
and held the barrel firmly in his left.some
eight or- nine inches below the muzzle.
The flat of the stock was pressed against
his right side at the top of the hip bone
and a little to the front, so he did not
face the object he shot at. but had it
quartering on his left. I am sure about
these details, because i' watched him par
ticularly.
' "The first thing I saw. him knock over
was a rabbit, which was loping across a
plowed field. He steadied the gun for an
Instant, with a gesture that reminded me
somehow of a man holding a billiard cue,
and* then blazed away. The rabbit
dropped. Afterward I saw him shoot a
lark on the wing and two other birds sit
ting. He afterward missed a couple of
wing shots, but I saw enough to convince
me that there was no accident about his
first work. He didn't pretend to shoot as
well from the hip as from the shoulder,
and admitted frankly that he couldn't
bring down difficult game. such, for in
stance, as snipe. 'I can hit about three
out of five,' he said, 'when I pick my own
conditions," and I believe he could do even
better.
"When I asked him how he did It he
laughed. 'There is no mystery about hip
shooting,' he said, 'and It 13 a great mis
take to suppose It â¢ Is necessary to look
over the sights in order to hit- things.
How does an archer bring . down flylnsr
birds? He doesn't look along thcarrow;
he shoots by sense of direction, and I do
the same thing with a gun. It isn't every
body who possesses this sense of direc
tion,' he added, 'but those who have Itâ
perhaps one out of threeâ can learn hip
shooting without difficulty.' "
"I believe there Is a good deal In the
â¢sense-ofrdirection' theory," said another
sportsman in the group. "I lived in the
West five or six years, and I know for a
certainty that nearly all of the best off
hand pistol shots among the cowboys
fired without aimingâ I mean without
sighting in the usual manner along the
barrel. They would look at the target In
stead of the weapon, and would generally
give Tthelf pistols a alight' forward thrust
before pulling the trigger. It was done on
the Instant, and those who were clever at
It? could I be fairly confident \ of hitting a
mark the size of a man's hat at say. fifty
paces. Noneof them/clalmed to be able
to } shoot as -accurately that way : as he
could Â¦ by sighting:, -but , It r was a - pretty
and what part of the page. There are
students with that kind of memory who
prepare their recitations by taking a
large sheet of paper and writing different
parts of the lesson In different places on
the paper. They then rely on their sense
of location to call to 'mind whatever they
may wish to remember.
Again there are people who have a keen
eye for color. They will make their mem
oranda on slips of paper of different col
ors. Then simply calling to mind a par
ticular color will enable them to remem
ber the memorandum associated with that
color.
Some people who can remember words
and phrases find difficulty In remembering
figures or numbers. In such cases a curi
ous expedient has sometimes been resort
ed to. A phrase will be devised, the initial
letters of which suggest the figures sought
to be remembered. For example, suppose
some one's street number to be 1S2. Tho
suggestive phrase might be "I seek him."
The letter I will suggest the figure I: the
letter S somewhat resembles an 8, and the
two perpendicular strokes of the H sug
gest the Roman numeral II. A rounda
bout method this mav'be, but' it has
served to fasten figures in the memory
of the people who had previously found
them troublesome.
But perhaps the most troublesome way
in the long run is simply by. repetition
and effort to fix the thing In the memory
directly without tricks'of memory or ar
tificial methods. By memorizing one sen
tence or verse a day from the best liter
ature the mind will soon have a fine
treasure of beautiful thoughts and an en
riched vocabulary, '. Dr.; "William Punshon,
a great English preacher, diu this, and
his fine prose may have been largely due
to his familiar acquaintance with the best
literature.
For quotation purposes' it Is necessary
to remember verbatim andthough this Is
the hardest task of memory it well repays
the effort. Once trained the memory will
be able to recall the exact woxds of con
versations, sermons ' and passages in
books without having made any conscious
effort to commit them.
Â§OQD FOR A
poor MSMORy.
mAXT people complain of having
a poor memory and yet that fac
ulty can be developer as easily
as can the biceps muscles. Nojr^
Is It necessary to go to any professor of
memory cr to master anl elaborate sys
tem in order to accomplish this result.
One does not have to gro to a gymnasium
to strengthen one's arm or back. Sawing
wood or rowing a boat will do It. Simi
larly memory reay be cultivated by one's
cwn efforts and amid one's â dinary pur
euits.
One man made the Sunday service of
his church serve as a metnorv exercise
After the service he would endea\'or to
recall the numbers of all the hymr.s sung,
the chapter and verse of the Scripture
lesson, words of anthem texts and points
of termon. This required the paying of
close attention and a consciove effort to
Impress these things upon his mind. By
this and other equally simple means he
developed a memory that was absolutely
at hi* command.
Famous speakers who have memorised
their speeches have adopted vp^ious sim
ple devices to aid them. The late Hon.
John Bright fixed In Ms mind the differ
ent points in his speeches by first draw-
Ing little flguvs or pictorial representa
tions. If part of his speech had to do with
a bridge he would make a little sketch cf
euch a structure, or Â«I with Ireland or
Scotland he would sketch a small map of
the country' or the district. H could re
member these figures or pictures. When
he rose to his feet he could see them lr.
imagination and select them one by one
as he proceeded from point to point in
his addressâ net having any note or man
uscript by him at all. That was thÂ«
method that best suited him.
Another way of memorizing the points
of an address to be delivered, one which
the writer has 'frequently used, is by
means of anagrams. It Is very simple.
Suppose one were called, upon to deliver
a Fourth of July oration and wished to
epeak mainly upon these three points:
Q) Historic origin of the day, (2) the suc
cess cf the experiment in government
then inaugurated, and (3) the jdestlny of
the .republic. A very suitable anagram to
recall these po' r <ts to mind would be the
letters U. S: A. He could set bis topics
dov.n in this way:
Ur.lcn proclaimed by Declaration of In-
dependence.
Success of experiment in government.
After the present, what?
He does not reed to take any notes with
him on the 'platform. He can easily re
member these letters. Remembering
them they recall his topics. And remem-.
bering the general topic It will Itself sug
gest any subdivisions pertaining to it.
Certain people posses* what may. be
called the bump of location. If they re

significance among primitive peoples. He
finds that ornaments, whether dress,
which was worn as an ornament long be-

pictorial language.
But ornament speaks a universal lan
guage. Is In itself a kind of volapuk. To
illustrate: Long robes are universally
recognized as a symbol of dignity, for tho
man or woman in a 'ong robe must walk
Elowly, not run. Here lies the explanation
of the difficulties encountered in wean

bespeak her dignityâ therefore she will

McKinley's picture into shreds and as
saulted the speakers with mallets, bricks,
tin cans arid paving blocks. A riot call
was turned in from one of the factories
near by and a wagon load of policemen
from the- Chicago-avenue station quelled
the disturbance.
The speakers most serlous.ly Injure-1
were Judge W. W. Frost of Missouri and
Attorney O. H. McConoughey of Chicago.
McConoughey was beaten with a mallet
on the head and rendered unconscious.
) i Judge Frost was struck with a brick In
the right. side while chasing a man who
tore down the Stars and Stripes. Another
brick dislocated his left elbow and dis
abled him from further duties for the day.
The riot occurred In front of the factory
of the Hawley Down Draft Furnace Com

at noon. The factory of the Illinois Can
Company Is across the street from the
furnace company's plant. Workmen from
the two factories were gathered to hear

Grand Pacific Hotel, and aronnd this point
the greatest enthusiasm of the parade
was shown. Senator Hanna especially
was cheered by the marchers and was
kept busy responding to the salutations.
Many out-of-town organizations were
represented in the parade. The most
prominent was a delegation of. 130 from
the A.merieus Club of Pittsburg, who were
guests of the* Hamilton Club. Big march

Hoodlum followers of Bryan tried in vain to mar the magnificent Republican procession in Chi
cago yesterday. In the great pageant were workingmen from all the industries of tho lake city and
many representatives from business and professional circles. There* were 150,000 men in line and this
monster parade of voters was in motion from 10 a. m. until 4:30 p. m.

other and were thus enabled to make
their arguments heard by thousands of
people.
The Illumination of the Court of Honor
was begun as soon as darkness set in. and
soon after from Randolph to Van Buren
streets it was a solid blaze of light. The
crowds began to gather early and soon
the broad thoroughfare was one mass of
shouting, enthusiastic humanity, through
which it was almost impossible for the
police to secure passage for the carriages
containing the orators of the evening.
Fireworks were shot oft* and Democratic
ward clubs and ward organizations from
all parts of the city added their numbers
and their enthusiasm to the. excitement
of the celebration.
Mr. Stevenson arrived at noon from
Mllwaukea and was entertained at dinner
by the Iroquois Club, followed by a re
ception. Later in the afternoon Mr."Ste
venson was joined at the Iroquoia Club
rooms by Senator Blackburn and thÂ©
other speakers. Shortly after 7 o'clock
the orators were driven to the State
street stands and the speaking 1 began.
Mr. Stevenson was greeted at all points
with the greatest enthusiasm-

The sentiment of the majority was against

CHICAGO, Oct. 27.â For six hours
and a half to-day workingmen
from every branch of industry in
Chicago, lawyers, merchants, rail
road men and financiers, marched
through the downtown streets of the city
In the parade of Republican voters, which
was planned as the culmination of the na
tional campaign In Chicago. Between two
solid lines of spectators stre'.che.} frcm the
starting pclnt of the long march on Mich
igan avenue to its disbanding place on
Jackson boulevard, near the river, and un
derneath thousands of flags and banners
stretched between the big buildings and
waving from the windows and roofs, the
paraders tramped from 10 In the morning
until 4:30 in the afternoon.
The day was practically a holiday in
Chicago. The Eoard of Trade, the banks
and many of the big downtown stores
were closed, and the residence districts
were practically deserted, while the peo
ple massed themselves along the miles of
tortuous march and applauded to their
heart's content.
The day was a perfect one. Hardly a
cloud flecked the sky, while a cool breeze
from Lake Michigan tempered the warm
rays of the sun and kept fluttering the
flags and streamers which decorated the
line of march, and lifted high in the air
the scores of Immense kites from which
were suspended "McKinley and Prosper
ity" banners. Â«iâ -Â» ~r* -* â¢
START OF THE PARADE.
Promptly at 10 o'clock the head of the
parade, composed of a double line of po
lice and followed by Chief Marshal E. C.
Young and stafT, moved from the starting
point at Michigan avenue and Randolph
street, and from that time the marchers,
with scores of bands playing all kinds of
musicâ good, bad and indifferentâ tramped
steadily over the granite pavements past
the reviewing stand on Jackson boule
vard" to Jackson and Market streets,
where /they disbanded. At nearly every
point along, the ljne of parade, the march
ers, cheering, waving flags, blowing horns
and singing campaign songs as they filed
by, were cheered in return by the densely
packed masses on the sidewalks, but here
and there a counter demonstration In fa
vor Of Bryan was made by the throngs,
and in one instance' almost a riot took
place in consequence.
BRYAN ROUGHS APPEAR.
In front of the City Hall, on Washing
ton street, were gathered a crowd of en
thusiastic Bryan shouters. all waving pic
tures of the Democratic Presidential can
didate. Some one in the crowd on the
walk threw a potato into the ranks of a
West Side marching club going by. The
potato hit a Â«marcher in the eye and
forced him to leave the* ranks. Another
marcher plunged Into the crowd and forc
ed his way to the thrower. In an instant
there was a free-for-all fight. Three com
panies of the marchers broke ranks and
with uplifted canes rushed into the strug
glingi shouting mass on the sidewalk.
It took. vigorous work by over thirty po-
licemen before things were quieted down,
and in the meantime black eyes and gory
noses had accumulated to an alarming ex
tent. Â¦
MANY UNIQUE FEATURES.
The parade was replete' with unique fea
tures. Well up toward the : head of the
parade arid preceding the members of the
Marquette Club, who were in tallyhos,
two" elephants lumbered along, bearing on
their sides banners Inscribed "G. O. P."
These were the mascots of the Marquette
Club. Close- behind the elephants came a
diminutive' donkey labeled "I am a sound
money, donkey." . , 7~
The Hamilton Club contributed a float
bearing a stuffed elephant appropriately
decbrted arid bearing ; various legends.
Furnaces in full; blast, with .rows of per
spiring, workmen, took the fancy of the
crowd, as 'did an enormous dinner pall
mounted on "â¢ trucks ! and f estooned with
canvas ; hams and loaves of . bread. .

.Mr. . Bryan in "i the - House" of Representa

8LJ Completing over 1100 miles of
g jfr travel and having made Over fifty
*â¢^ speeches, Governor Roosevelt fin
ished the first week of his State
campaign in this city to-night. This was
Governor Roosevelt's forty-third birth
day. The Special train was discarded by
the party, here and hotel beds were, adopt
ed for resting, purposes to-night. Speak
ing here to-night, Governor Roosevelt
said:
"The other day at Yonkers Mr. Bryan
said that it was better for Mexico that
we did not keep possession of the,coun
try. The United States never wished to
keep possession of Mexico, but letv; Mr.
Bryan compare the progress that has been
made in New Mexico, which we did take,
with what -went .on before and ho will
speedily make up his mind that it . has
greatly prollted by being put under our
flag. Incidentally,. if Mr. Bryan will look
up the history of the Territory of New
Mexico he will see that he need not be
concerned about Porto Rico. We governed
New Mexico at first exactly as we are
governing Porto Rico. No.w we give
largely a measure of self-government, to
its people, just as we have given such a
measure to Porto Rico. For titty years
.New Mexico has been kept as a Teerltory,
yet Mr. \ Bryan â¢ does not talk about the
consent of the governed in New Mexico.
As a matter of fact, I believe New Mex
ico should 1 now be a State, but itwpuld
have been folly to have admitted it to
statehood for the forty odd years after
we took possession. In the same, way it
would be folly now to administer the gov-;
ernment of Porto: Rico save as .we are
actually administering it. One" Bryanite
advocate the other day quoted the elder
Adams, a signer of the Declaration of In
dependence and the flrst President after.
Washington, as an anti-expansionist, but
in reality Mr. Adams in a letter : to Sen
ator Quincy of February 9. 1S11, explicitly
states that the constitution admits of (to
use his own words) 'conquering by kind
ness or force alien territory'.' Â»
"I doubt if there was a single statesman
worthy of" the name among those who
founded this Government who ever adopt
ed in Eerious earnestness the extreme po
sition now "occupied by Mr. Bryan."
At Callicoon depot the Governor ap-.
pealed j to his hearers < on the grounds , of
gelf-interest and patriotism. He . dwelt
upon the prosperity of things now as com
pared with four or five years back and
said:
"Mr. Bryan â¢ Is making* his -canvass
against. the honor, of the flag precisely as
the copperheads Â¦ from- 1S61 to 'Â¦ 1865 ' made
their canvass against' the honor: of Vine

'At Long Eddy/where* another stop of ten
garden was filled and the police stopped
further entry, at 7 o'clock. Then the 'late
comers turned their attention to the two
outside stands. The principal onÂ© was at
Madison avenue and Twenty-fourth street
and was brilliantly illuminated.
The many smaller stands used by the
Republicans on Friday night were still in
place and these had been decorated with
lanterns and lights, and speakers mounted
these and made speeches. Â¦ At Madison
square Garden Mr. Bryan was noisily re
ceived. Â¦ . â¢ â¢ Â¦
Â¦ "We need them," he said, "moro than
Republicans need similar clubs, for we
must do- by volunteers what Republicans
can Â¦ hire done. We must rely upon ' them
and their members to aid in perfecting
the organization throughout the country.
We must rely upon them to raise the
money to provide for meetings and to cir
culate .literature, and our club organiza
tions have not been more effective than
in this campaign.

ciples; the Republican party is urging'ex

plying familiar principles to new condi
tions; the Republican party is removing
the ancient landmarks."
In connection with his discussion of the
trusts Mr. Bryan mentioned the names of
Senator Hanna and Governor Roosevelt,
whereupon. 'there were hisses and groans
from different parts of the assemblage.
Mr. Bryan again referred to the utterance
credited to Senator Scott . of West Vir
ginia, to the effect "that trusts " were a
good thing," and referred to the fact that
Senator Scott ifÂ» In charge of the Eastern
branch 'of Republican headquarters. He
said he cited these facts to show. that the
Republican party is the defender of the
trusts. Â¦ , . .
â "Think." he exclaimed, "of a party tak
ing a position, as Senator Scott has done,
that the Standard Oil trust is a' blessing
to this jiountry." .
Senator Wellington of Maryland fol
lowed Mr. Bryan.
Mr. Bryan had a hard time getting out
of" the garden and out: of the speaker's
stand. The police vigilance seemed to be
unavailing. Hundreds of men . swarmed
about the press inclosure and around the
speaker's stand.' The crowd quickly
choked the small stairway down which
Â¦ Mr. . Bryan had to pass. Chief ' Devery
stood helpless in the center of the surging
crowd; and Mr. Bryan's companions had
to force a passage for him and themselves
through the throng.

â¢ Mr. Bryan's Madison-square ' Garden
epeech was not begun until- after 10
o'clock. It was unlike his former speech
at that place. It was addressed to the
Independent class mainly, and ' he - re
ferred to the financial issue. Many times
he was forced to stop because of the tre
mendous cheering. From the time he en
tered the hall until he quit speaking the"
outside of the hall was- ringing with
cheer*.
As a climax to the day he made two
other outdoor speeches. - The ' flrst was
from a stand near Dewey arch, where he
talked to 15.000 persons who could "riot get
into Madlson-tKjuare Garden. He made
another short epeech at Madison j avenue
end Twenty-fourth street. He was then
driven to the Hoffman House, where he
retired for the night.
From the time Mr. Bryan left the Hoff
man House early in the evening until' he
reached the hotel, when all the meetings
were over, he was in the midst of a" roar
or noise which was deafening. At Madi
son square a few minutes after 6 o'clock

This morning was spent at Xew Haven
and this afternoon he made several ad

Miltant harmonious action in all impor

pronounced reactionary and agrarian
members of the Cabinet, like Dr. Miquel,
Count von Posadowsky-Wehner, Baron

of the preÂ»g that seized upon the incident
of 12,000 marks having been accepted by

arguments for the anti-strike bill, a slight
Incident in itself, to attempt therewith
to hoist Count von Posadowsky-Wehner,
who has always been the most dangerous
enemy the United States had in the Cab

It would seem, however, that Count
von Posadowsky-Vv'ehner in this matter
feels sure of the Emperor's approval and
will not resign unless the Reichstag dur
ing the forthcoming session morally
forces him to do so.

DESIRABILITY
OF ARBITRATION
IN THE ORIENT
Dissension Regarding the
Punishment of the Real
Culprits.
Â¦ i ?-. â
Ministers Unwilling to Accept the
Word of the Chinese Govern
ment, but .Wish to Witness
. Executions.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
CALL BUREAU. WELLINGTON HO
TEL, WASHINGTON, Oct. 27.â Further
evidence of the desirability of referring
the entire Chinese question to arbitration
has been given by the dissension which
exists In Peking relative to the punish
ment of the responsible authors of the
Chinese outrages.
Remembering the Bufferings they under
went.during the siege of the legations,
some of the Ministers decline to be satis
fied with the assurances of the Chinesa
Government that certain persons have
been punished,, but they want to see the
punishments executed or have a represen
tative on hand -to witness them. There
is reason to believe that the President and
Secretary Hay are not in sympathy with
.the spirit of vlndictiveness that prevails
and they are anxious to get the punish
ment feature . of 1 the negotiations out of
the way. as promptly as possible. Thougn
the Chinese Government may cause ex
treme punishment to.be visited upon a
great many persons guilty of foreign out
rages, it is possible tnat a power llKe Ger
many, which suffered the indignity of
having its official representative killed,
will not be satisfied and will demand fur
ther sacrifices. i
This is the very difficulty which the ad
vocates of arbitration believe'd could be
easily and promptly disposed of by the
international court of arbitration of The
Hague. Such a body would be absolutely
dispassionate. It would have no reason
to desire revenge nor would It display par
tiality in the matter. It would make a
fair investigation and would fix upon
those whom evidence showed to be re
sponsible the guilt which they had com
mitted and would recommend such pun
ishments as would thoroughly fit their
crimes. Negotiations over the punishment
of the guilty, which are now in progress,
may be indefinitely prolonged by the vin
dictive spirit being displayed.
Secretary Hay is anxious, however, that
direct negotiations shall be thus employed
in an attempt to brinrabout peace. There
is final recourse always to arbitration, but
the Secretary believes it is in the interest
of diplomacy that the Ministers and Chi
nese Peace Commissioners should first en
deavor to reach a solution. J
As stated in The Call this morning, Mr.
Conger understands from the action of
the President in accepting the suggestion
of Russia for the arbitration of the in
demnity question in case of a protracted
divergence of views, that the administra
tion favors the observance of the
principle in the event of a complete
disagreement. Were it not for the delay
tnat arbitration would cause due to the
investigation that would have to be insti
tuted there is no doubt that the adminis
tration would urge this method of solu
tion after a reasonable opportunity had
been given to effect a settlement by nego
tiation. Minister AVu Is satisfied that
China would be glad to accept such a
method of reaching aÂ»settlement, but tho
Chinese Commissioners cannot advance
a proposition of this character. They
must rather await its submission to them.
Through Special Commissioner Rockhill,
Secretary Hay received confirmation of
the suicide of Yu Hsien, reported to the
State Department- yesterday by Minister
Wu. Minister Conger has' advised Secre
tary Hay that he has been assured by thi>
Chinese Commissioners, wj^o have" heard
from the imperial court, t|Â»t there Is no
intention to remove ' the ;â¢ viceroys of the
southern provinces. â 2".. ?'.Â¦"'
No positive assurances have been re
ceived by Secretary Hay that thÂ« Imperial
court will return to Peking. The depart
ment has been informed on several recent
occasions that the court would return,
but this information was subsequently de
nied. The department is not certain of
the intentions of the court, but In well
informed diplomatic 'Circles It Is not be
lieved that the Emperor and Empress
Dowager will return so long as the pow
ers retain such large forces In Peking.

PEKING. Oct. 27â Prince Chlng and U

also on severe punishment of the guilty
Ministers. The Emperor asks for their

failed to induce the other powers to aban

the. same opinion, encouraged the Boxers

"The truest mercy in the present case,"
says the Globe, "is to be merciless." ,
That fairly voices the average opinion
of the Government organs/awhile a few
out and out radical organs scarcely con
ceal their satisfaction arising from their
ability to say "I told you so" In reference
to the war being long drawn out and en
gendering racial hatred that a century
will not dissipate.
An encounter as dramatic as any that
marked the battlefields of South Africa
may shortly occur at Marseilles. The plan
of Joseph Chamberlain, the Secretary of
State for the Colonies, to go to Marseilles
to meet Mrs. Chamberlain, who is now at
Alx-les-Balns. will more than probably be
effected about the time Mr. Kruger la ar
riving at the same port on the Dutch
steamer Gelderland. Judging from tho
tone of French public opinion, the simul
taneous arrival of these two leading fig
ures in the late world drama would afford
opportunities for demonstrations not too
pleasant for Mr. Chamberlain and which
might possibly cause international com
plications that would be hard to settle
peaceably. :,Â¦Â¦'-

PARIS, Oct. 27.â It seems as If ' Paris,
having sulked a little against the Expo
sition, cannot new part with It. The offi
cial announcement of its prolongation
for one week until 'SovmW r 12 was well
received by the public and exhibitors.
The Swan Song of the Worlds Fair
leads the press to ask that these fairy
like constructions may not disappear al
together. The first universal exhibition
of 1S55 left behind the Palais de l'lndus
trie, the 1S7S exhibition bequeathed the
Trocadero, and the 1SS9 fair the Eiffel
Tower.
The papers are now urging the preser
vation of the famous Galerle des Ma
chines, which Is one of the marvels of
the iron Industry, and also the beauti
ful conservatories. They also urge the
laying out of a promenade on the banks
of the Seine bo as to preserve the mar
velous Rue des Nations that was the
real feature of the exposition, "clou," as
they eay here. But this is very difficult,
for once these temporary palaces are
pulled down what will remain of the
magic scene?
This is connected with a still greater
<;:uslion of the enlargement of Pa:;s by
ll.e eradjfication of the fortifications on
the west and the inclusion in the city of
Fix suburban communities â Villancourt.
Boulogne, Neuilly, Levallols, Clichy and
Kalntouen. This would add 200.000 to the
population. The demolition of these use
less fortifications would place the Hois
de Boulogne inside of Paris, like Central
Park in New York. This has been for a
long time one of the schemes the Gov
ernment had in view to employ the thou
sands of hands which the disappearance
of the exposition will soon leave without
work.
In 1SS1 there were in Paris 291 inhab
itants for every hectare (about two an<i a
half acres). This pave about twenty-flve
p<juare yaxds tf> each person. By 1SS0
this space had been reduced to nine
equare yards for each person. Just ground
enough being allowed for the perpetual
foncossion in the cemetery. The aver
age number of persons to the hectare be
came 3J5 and then 425. and then in certain
quarters near the boulevards ( t rnnrnT<vl
to 1025. Thus the extension of Paris is an
urgent problem of the immediate future.
TherÂ« Is Still a Great Question
of the Enlargement of
the French Capital
Itself.

PRESIDENT LOUBET .OF
FRANCE, WHOSE LIFE IS
SAID TO BE THREATENED.
Cast. M. O. Tarnell.
Much that Is called rheumatism is In
reality myalgia. Myalgia is an affec-
tion of the larger .muscles, especially
those in the small of the back, produc-
ing pain, stiffness, cramp, and frequent-
ly distress on the. slightest movement.
When the muscles of the small of the
back are Involved It Is generally called
lumbago. If the large muscles of the
arms or legs are the seat of the affection
it is generally then called muscular
rheumatism. They are one and all the
same affection, however.
The month of October brings cool days
and cooler nights. The dally perspira-
tion of the hot months is gradually and
sometimes suddenly discontinued. This
produces an acid condition of the blood
which the kidneys are not always aWc
to correct. By stimulating the mucoud
membranes of the whole body the accu-
mulations of acid in the blood . can be
drained away. This could be done -with
Peruna taken according to the directions
on the bottle.
"I can cheerfully recom-
mend your Peruna for
rheumatism, and it is also
a very substantial catarrh
remedy."

People who have been long â¢ubject to

of their bad symptoms at the approach
of cold weather. October Is a good time
to fortify the system against this liability.
This climate Is especially productive of
catarrh, because of Its extremes of cold
and hot weather. No sooner do we escape
from hot weather than we find ourselves
In the midst of wintry weather. One bot-
tle of Peruna now may prevent a catarr-
hal affection later on that would take
many bottles to cure.

SEATTLE. Oct. 27.â Nome advices state
that upon motion of the plaintiffs In the
case of Robert Phlpps vs. the Pioneer
Mining Company, Judge Noyes issued an
Injunction order prohibiting the Pioneer
people from moving any dust taken from
Discovery on Anvil out of Nome precinct.
This order was served < on the defendants
on October 10, and an appeal was at once
taken.
The Injunction made It necessary for the
company to close the claim and to dis
charge the large number of men It had
been employing there. The defendants
work the claim at their own expense and
if they are not allowed to use the output
the money expended is dead loss. The in
junction is considered remarkable froiri
the fact that its effect is diametrically
opposite to that the writ of supersedeas,
issued- by the Circuit Court of Appeals,
was expected to have. The Circuit Court
directed McKenzie to turn dust and ev
erything else over to ! the defendants,
while the Phipps injunction practically re
strains the same defendants from hand
ling the property which the higher court
has given into their oharge and which,
notwithstanding the positive mandate,
they have not succeeded In getting
hold of.

The intensity of the feeing of Nome peo
ple on the matter of receivership was
demonstrated on October 9 at a great
mass meeting which was called for the
purpose of electing three delegates to rep
resent the district at the coming session
of Congress and lobby for the amendment
and the betterment of the mining laws.
The meeting Is reported to have been
most enthusiastic, and after some debate
the following wcro elected . as delegates:
Samuel Knight of San Francisco (chair
man). Captain Gcorga Baldwin of San
Frrmcireo and E. M. Bennlnger. <
' The polioy which the delegates will pur
sua is given in resolutions presented to
the meeting by Lafe Pence and unani
mously adopted, as .follows:.
Whereas, The growth and prosperity of
Alaska, and particularly the northwestern part
thereof, 1b Inseparably connected with tie min-
Ing- industry; and ~ whereas, , contests without
merit over mlnlnc olalms which h&ve baen
proved to be valuable, and miration arising 1
therefrom, have increased htrÂ« to anon an
alarming extent as to prevent those legitimately
Â«T>~m& la mining 1 from developing- and operat
ing: their claims and discourage the Invest
ment of capital therein; and whereas, an un
precedented and Iniquitous practice has re-'
ccntly bÂ«en instituted ben of appointing re
ceivers regardless of their fltnees and from mo
tives of personal tain over mining properties
lnvolvÂ«d In litigation, for the benefit of such
receivers and not of the litigant*, and sum
marily dispossessing those who, with their
grantors and predecessors in Interest, have
hitherto been not only In possession of such
properties for some time, and working; tha samÂ«
In good faith under a claim of title, but who
have also expended in many Instances large
â¢urns of money for development work thereon;
and whereas, this practice has not only given
rise to blackmail In various ways, and osten
sibly under the forms of law, but has also
Etlfled the permanent growth of this commu
nity, retarded the development of its mines
and ether Industries and blackened its fair
name and reputation; and whereat, we bolleve
that the character and form of government of
tills district. Its great distances and remote
situation from other portions of the United
States, enlle it to a separate system of Federal
mining laws, so framed as to meet the local
conditions existing here,, and so arranged and
phrased as to be easily Intelligible to the vast
body of miners -who make this the field of their
operations.
With this it sent its officers to effect the
arrest and enforce the terms of the writ.
McKenzie refused to surrender the dust,
and to gain time he had his attorneys
present themselves before the United
States Court of Appeals and ask that the
court interpret more fully that portion of
the writ. Tho court replied:
"The writ was clothed in forcible, un
mistakable terms. It speaks for itself."
About two months ago the Circuit Court
of Appeals issued a writ of supersedeas,
directed to Judge Noyes and Receiver Mc~
Kenzle, commanding them to vacate the
receivership on the Anvil Creek property
nnd turn over over to the defendants, the
Pioneer Mining Company and Charles D.
Lane, all of the gold dust extracted from
the claims worked under his regime. The
writ called attention to the fact that if
they disobeyed it they did so at their own
peril. Judge Noyes accordingly vacated
McKenzie's receivership, but refused to
make an order compelling him to turn
over the gold dust.

Both horses appeared to be in the pink

to be a handicap and Royal Flush was

them to Nevada to be present at the cere

make the trip. Her absence was the only
feature to mar the happiness of the San

marriage occurred months before the date
for which they had planned it. because of
the unfortunate publicity given an erro

wedded several days ago. Mr. and Mrs.

WASHINGTON. Oct. 27.â Minister Con
per hag preferred charges of eovk...'dice
against" Captain Newt T. Hall. U. S. M. C,
the second in command of the marine
force at Peking 1 during the siege. The de
tails are closely guarded, the regulations
of the War Department and the Navy De
partment strictly forbidding publicity at
this stage. It is gathered, however, that
Mr. Conger questioned Captain Hall's
courage because of the latter declina
tion to carry out certain military opera
tions suggested by the Minister. The
charges in the ordinary course passed into
the hands of General Chaffee, the com
mander in chief of the forces ln China,
who examined .them, made an Inquiry on
his own account and then, concluding that
the whole matter rested on the difference
of judgment between the Minister and the
captain, sent the papers to Washington,
with a recommendation that no further
proceedings be had, a finding vindicating
the captain.
From the War Department the papers
went to the Navy Department, and after
some consideration It was determined that
the high morale of the marine corps re
quired the most formal and complete ac
quittal of an accused officer from such .a
charge in order that he might not in after
years suffer from its repetition. Conse
quently the papers were referred to Gen
eral Hey wood, the commandant of ma
rines, who is taking steps to have a thor
ough investigation by a proper court. It
happens that the only report of the con
duct of the marines at Peking, to reach
the department was from Captain Hall,
the senior officer, Captain Miles being too
ill to report.

Btart West on Friday to open the season
in California, arrived from Europe to-day.
Mr. Grau, Mme. Nordica and others were
on the New York. Mme. Melba came on
the Campania. Others arrived on the
Acquitane. The company will return here
in December for a long stay at the Metro

Boheme,' which is one of Mme. Melba s
great successes; but as Puccini will not be
Bere ln time It will be, given later ln the
season. In 'La Tosca' the ernina will
appear. I expect also to give 'Le Cid and

one of the great prlma donnas of the day.
Mme. Nordlca's contract for the New

trip over. When we sailed we had signed
for only fifteen appearances on the West-
Mme. Nordica came down the gangway

merpau for the "Passion Play, and also
by Mme. Cosima's invitation spent a few
days ln Bayreuth. Yes. Mr. Grau and
myself came to terms for the New York
season on the trip over. I think that the
sea air benefited him, or perhaps he has
contracted the 'Nordlca habit.' '
"I am delighted to bo back," said Mme.

Bays tetter Filed With Supervisors
Is the Work of a
A letter was filed yesterday with the
Board of Supervisors purporting: to have
been written by and bearing the alleged
signature of Mrs. Ernestine Krellng, man
ager of the Tivoll Opera-house. The
substance of the letter Is a warning: to
playgoers against the Grau Opera Com
pany. The writer says: "This company
is composed of one prima donna and one
tenor. The balance of the company will
be comprised of our. local operatic frater
nity under assumed Italian names. The
same artists can be heard ln our local
opera-house for 50 cents. A bond should
be executed and duly tilled up to the order
of his Honor the Mayor and the Chief of
Police' for the faithful .performance of
contract by the Grau, Opera. Company as
advertised in the dally papers."
When seen yesterday afternoon Mrs.
Krellng and-.W,' H. Leahy were highly In
dignant over the affair. "It is the work
of a crank," said Mrs. Â¦â¢ Kreling.
"Any one who knows tho Tivoli knows."
said â¢ Leahy, "that ; a rival company In
creases the popular taste for opera and
sends us audlonces we should not other
wise 'get. Besides. -the Grau- Opera Com
pany is composed' of responsible artists
and is without doubt ! the - greatest ever
brought to this coast. This letter is the

WHAT PEOPLE SAY.
Is Not What Makes a Remedy
Valuable.
Testimonials are good things and we
are always glad to get them, but they
don t make our remedy any better
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are good be-
cause they do goodâ because they cure.
Testimonials simply prove that the Tab-
lets have helped other people, but it's
yourself you are most interested in, and
whether they, will cure you is the Ques-
tion. -\.
It is very easy to ftnd outâ try them.
A full package costs but fifty cents at
your druggists. They are worth that if
they only help you a little bit. The chance
is worth taking at the price.
We put it on that basis because you
don't know about the tablets. If you
knew as much about them as we do you
would have complete confidence; this ad-
vertisement would be unnecessary We
have seen them cure the worst cases of
stomach trouble. Cases of long standing
and obstinacy, cases that other medicines
and even high priced doctors had failed
to subdue. r . Â¦'Â¦...
Here are some testimonials, -if you
care to read them we have thousands of
them: , .
Rev. J. R. Hoag of Wymore. Nebraska
writes: For six years I have been
troubled with dyspepsia. Last fall I be-
came very much alarmed at some symp-
toms of heart trouble and cams to be-
lieve there waa a sympathetic relation
between the two diseases, or rather, that
the stomach trouble was the cause of the
heart disturbance. I , hit upon Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets for a remedy and in-
vested a dollar and a half for three boxes,
which lasted me three months, and I can
eat any kind of food I want and have
a good vigorous appetite. Although I am
77 years old, I now feel perfectly well,
and without being requested by any one
I make this statement as a compliment to
the virtues of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
Mrs.Lydla Bartram of Assyria, Mich.,
writes: I have suffered from stomach
trouble, for ten years and five different
doctors _gave me only temporary relief.
A Mr. E. R. Page advised me to try
Stuart's - Dyspepsia Tablets, and four
boxes did me more permanent benefit than
all the doctor's medicines that I have
ever taken.
We honestly believe that Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets are the best medicine ever
made for the cure of stomach troubles.
Don't mistake qur meaning. We don't
claim them to cure anything but dyspep-
sia and stomachic disorders. Just the one
thing is what â¢ they - are made for, but
that one thine is the cause â the starting
p Int f of nearly all ; the sickness in the
v.'O'ld. Â¦Â¦.---Â¦ â¢ .- Â¦ i
Use Stuart's Tablets regularly. Keep
your stomach right and you can never be
sick. :

81 pepYcar.ANTIOCH. Oct.. 27.â Preaent Indications
point strongly to the fact that Antloch is
destined in the near future to become a
great oil center. Several companies are
preparing: to bore for oil in territory
south of Antloch. Thomas Gilbert of the
Tidewater Oil Syndicate, who is sinking
a well, has penetrated the first oil sands
and struck an oil strata at less than 400
feet. Considerable trouble was exper
ienced In this well on account of the vol
ume of water encountered, but casing has
been put in and this water removed.
Yesterday the- Fitzpatrick place, south
of town, waa sold for $15,000. It was
bought by a man who will prospect It for
oil. Eastern Contra Costa County Is al
ready beginning to. feel the effects of tha
oil excitement.

Their own Westbury palace will not be
ready for them until the fall of 1M. A
lirm of upholsterers is importing some
superb furnishings for the new house,
which is to be as sumptuous as two mil
lions can make it. Mr. Mackay has been
enjoying six weeks of grouse-shooting and
deer-stalking on two of the most famous
preserves in Scotland, and Mrs. Mackay
has been playing the hostess in the center
of a neighborhood where her noble Scotch
ancestors made history centuries ago.

not gratify her wish owing to social en
gagements in the city. The game is abun
dant in and around Hot Springs. There
are also numbers of pheasants and wild
turkeys. While the ladies at this favorite
resort for the Four Hundred may not
properly be called modern Dianas, since
they take little interest in the shooting it
self, they delight in horseback riding.
Mrs. Crocker, Mrs. Stuyvesant Fish, Miss
Fish and some of the young people rode
daily to Warm Springs, Flag Rock or
Falling Springs. Horses are in great de
mand and nearly 100 are kept for visitors.
Mrs. Herman Oelrichs, who has also

Clunie of San Francisco. Both were nere
on law business and stopped at the Hotel

day, Intending to stop one or two days
at Chicago en route. Governor Budd Is
spending a few days in Boston, but will
return here and expects to remain two
or three weeks in the vicinity ' of New
York.
Maude Adams scored a big success in
â¢TAJeion" on Monday night at the Em
pire Theater. The great hit she made on
the first night it was presented, at Balti
more, gave assurance that she would meet
with a similar reception here. Neverthe
less, there were some carping critics who
insisted that she was not suited for a he
roic part, and that her interpretation of
M. Rostand's famous character would not
be as acceptable to a Kew.York audience
as her Juliet. But she disappointed those
who were ready to witness her failure,
and sent the audience away delighted
with her remarkable and versatile powers.
Physically Miss Adams is well suited for
such a part In Its very nature it calls
for a slight physique, and in appearance
Miss Adams realized it completely. L'Aig
lon or the Eaglet, has the fiery and ro
mantic soul of his father, but his pinions
are those of a weak little fledgling, and
when he attempts to soar the attempt Is
pitiful. The roll calls for comedy, deep
sentiment. Infinite pathos and heroic cour
a "L'Alglon" Is considered by some au
thorities to be the greatest play; of the
century, and ? by not a few the greatest
since Shakespeare's time. It is quite gen
erally agreed that ,"V Aiglon" is ahead of
"Cyrano," and certainly "Cyrano". Is a
very great play.
All of Charles- Frohman's 'plays are
drawing well. .Richard. Carvel -Â¦ (John
Drew) has been one, of the most popular
attractions, but it must r soon make ; way
for Charles .? Frohman's stock * company.
David Harum, at Â» the Garrick.is playinc
to crowded houses and good seats are at
a premium. Mr. Crane has made a great
hit. - San Toy, at Daly's, has been . very
popular, but must soon make way. for one
of Daniel Frohman's . Â¦ stock : companies.
Blanche Walsh, at the Broadway, is only
drawing fairly well. She has been seen
to Â¦ better, advantage. A good many -are
glad that Mrs. Leslie Carter must pack
up her effects and take her prurient play
"Zaza" out on the road soon. The â¢ en
gagement of "Arizona," at the Herald
Square, will terminate about ! Christmas
time.after a most successful' run:- It has
been voted 'one of the best " plays Â¦ holding
the boards in; New York City. Richard

shows that the spirit of the novelist la
strong within him and the spirit of the
dramatist weak. He has not written a
well-constructed play, but he has put to
gether an interesting series of conversa
tions absolutely devoid of humor but con
taining some excellent strokes of satire
and some passages that are even poetical.
As an illustration of the latter, take the
following:
The cause Is not lost, but the next op
portunity will come to a new man.
KIRWAN'.
But the cause I have abandoned, is It
lost forever? Can I not return?
DEAN.
There is an antiquarian society; you
might Joint it and advocate the preserva
tion of our antiquities. But If I were you.
I would not vex my mood with anything
except the matter in hand. You're chosen
to be happy: be a success in what the
world calls success..
KIRWAN'.
I understand. All men axe not as high
and as steadfast as you. Kirwan. You
must Judge others by a different standard.
I have failed. I know, but is my failure
irreparable? Is there nothing to do now
except to be happy?

promised Mlllicent he will not go to the
meeting; Kirwan goes alone, and is ac

make himself leader in Dean's absence.
The crowd grows restless, excited, uncon
trollable. - Finally it mobs everybody in
sight except Lawrence, who. having
promised them a tramway to bÂ« built by
Southhaven capital, is elevated to be the
hero of the hour.
Xo sooner has Dean turned traitor to
his cause. than he perceives and regrets
his baseness:

tempt In the right direction. The nlnÂ©
little plays In this book divide themselves
into two classesâ those â¢which treat cr

which treat of realistic or modern therne*.
The former, of which Rohan the Silent

The literary element has been so Iocs
banished from the English drama that
many readers caay rnb their eyes ar.d in
quire what such passages are doing In a
play. But there 13 no reason why such
passages should cot occur In a play; Ja
fact there is every reason why they
should. If Mr. Moore can get them lis

CALITORNIANS IN NEW YORK.
The Cubans are busily engaged in preparing for
the constitutional convention, which is to assemble on
November 5. With the work of the convention the
United States Government will have nothing to do.
Governor Wood says: "At the convening of the dele
gates I shall limit my function to attendance lon#
enough to declare the convention open, the
briefest word to that effect I shall abdicate and leave
the delegates to their own devices. It will indeed be
a Cuban convention, having its own sergeants-at-arms
and all other necessary attendants. There will be ab
solutely nothing that can be tortured into the shape
of American coercion."
The most gratifying portion of the Governor':
statement is that referring to the reported antipathy
of the Cuban people toward the United States. The
Bryanites have frequently declared the existence of
such antagonism and have cited it as a proof that
the administration has been governing Cuba by a sys
tem of imperialism oppressive to the people and tend
ing to excite in their minds a fear that '.'we are going
to deprive them of their liberties.
Concerning that phase of the situation the Governor
LEONARD WOOD, Governor of Cuba, was re
cently in New York on his way to Washington,
and while there was interviewed upon the situa
tion in the island, giving a report which will be grati
fying to every American who has a genuine sympathy
with the Cubans in their desire for prosperity and in
dependence. With thÂ» exception of the recent increase
of yellow fever every condition of the people is prom
ising of good results, and it is to be noted that not
withstanding the fever the death rate of the island is
Itss than for many years.
Governor Wood attributes the increase of the fever
to the number of emigrants from Spain, who, being
unacclimated and not immune from the disease, fall
victims to it. This Spanish immigration is one of the
unexpected results of the war. It appears the Span
iards trust free Cuba more than they trusted Cuba
under Spanish rule. Governor Wood says: "The
Spanish immigration has been very heavy, no fewer
than 40,000 individuals having arrived since last Oc
tober. Railway facilities now completed will enable
us to ship many of them into the interior.- Of course
many will stay in Havana, finding employment in the
warehouses and factories, and we must expect to find
cases of yellow fever among them."
The fact that so many immigrants are pouring into
the island is itself a proof that good government existi
there. It is a remarkable tribute to American ad
ministration and an evidence that we are making the
island more attractive than it ever was before even to
the Spanish themselves.

What more can any business man or workingman
a?k of a Representative at this juncture? Let us re
turn to Congress a man who has been found faithful
to ihr interests of the State and whose experience will
ersble him to be in the future even more efficient than
in the past
Nor is that all. Referring to his work and service
:n Conpress. Mr. Kahn had the satisfaction of being
afcle to say to his constituents the other evening: Â«"I
pointed out to the Secretary of State the danger to
American bbor from the threatened influx of hordes
of Japanese, ar.d through his intercedence not a Jap
anese laborer has landed on American or Canadian
â¢oil in the pan four months. I introduced a bill and
forced its passage preventing 20.000 Chinese on the
Hawaiian Islands being: dumped upon uÂ«. I have
vcted for the Nicaragua canal bill in all its phases, and
denounce as utterly and maliciously false every state
ment to the contrary. I have urged the laying of the
Pacific cable and shall work for its manufacture right
here, which means an expenditure of from $6,000,000
to $8,000,000 among the mechanics and laborers of this
city. As Jons as I represent you in Congress I .shall
continue to work for the best interests of San Fran
citco and California, and shall never lack in energy
to procure for my city and State every possible advan
tage they and you are entitled to."
In uniting to support Mr. Kahn the members of the
business men's club are not relying upon expectation,
merely. A new man in the House is_ heavily handi
capped in work of all kinds, but, despite that draw
back, Mr. Kahn accomplished much during his first
tf trn, and his supporters can justify their faith in him
b;- the recoi d of what he has achieved. It was largely
due to his efforts that defeat attended a scheme to
make Nome a sub-port of entry. By that act alone
he saved to American merchants and ship-owners and
riamracturer? a trade equal to about $15,000,000.
It should be borne in mind, however, even by the
free traders zrA free silver rnen, that party measures
compose but a small part of Congressional work. The
bulk of legislation deals with raatterB on which par
ties are not divided. These matters are the outcome
at the general progress of the country, such as the
improvement of rivers and harbors, the construction
of Federal buildings, the establishment of rules and
regulations concerning trade, and similar issues. In
matters of that kind each Congressman is in duty
bemsd to present to Congress the claims and inter
ests of his own constituency, so that its welfare may
rct be sacrificed to other interests. To attend to mat
ters of thzt kind there is needed in Congress a thor
ot;ph business man, an energetic worker, a man who
knows the interests of his district and his State and
is able to maintain them in committee-rooms and in
debate on the floor. Mr. Kahn has proven himself
to be an able representative in matters of that kind,
fad accordingly even free traders and silver men. see
!rsr the impossibility of carrying those measures,
mipht well vote for Mr. Kahn on the broad ground
of his efficiency in supporting the business inteests
of the city and the State.
Not s single valid icason can be advanced to jus
tify a vote against Mr. Kahn unless it be that kind of
reasoning that upholds free trade, free silver and
Bryar.ism generally. It is known that Mr. Kahn is
z stanch and stalwart Republican; that he will in
Cor.gTess steadfastly uphold the protective tariff and
the gold standard; that he will sustain the McKinley
administration in z\\ great policies designed for pro
xrct:r.Â£ the prosperity of the people; so men who hope
to craw a prof.t from calamity may vote against him,
but 2:1 other voters should be with him first, last and
all the tin-.e.
ONE of the encouraging features of the local
campaign is the organization of a club of busi
ness men to work for the re-election of the
lion. Julius Kahn in the Fourth Congressional Dis
trict. California has suffered so much from the folly
of changing Congressmen every two years that this
manifestation of a determination among business men
tc support the incumbent because he has proven
faithful and efficient in office is a sign of increasing
political wisdom that promises to result in great bene
fits to every interest of the State.
THE RE-ELECTION OP KflHN.
That is a part of the record of the effects of Tam
many imperialism in New York, and from it the pub
lic can form an estimate of the nature of the issue
which Bryan's devotion to Croker now raises before
the people of the whole country. Crokerism has been
added to free silver, free trade and the assault on the
Supreme Court. The new issue is as portentous as
any of the former ones, and furnishes an additional
reason why all good citizens, without respect to party,
should vote against the man who cries in pride,
"Great is Tammany, and Croker is its prophet."
The direful effects of Tammany government in
New York City were recently set forth by Franklin
Matthews in Harpers' Weekly. After pointing out
the waste of money by official negligence and corrup
tion,, and the encouragement given to crime which
paid blackmail into the Tammany treasury, he went
on to say: "Go furthei into the Tammany control of
crime in New York. The report of the magistrates
shows that in 1899 there , was an increase of felonies
over 1S08 of 1244. and that in 1899 there wa3 an in
ciease in grand larceny cases over the previous yeir
of 610. Now look at these facts: The excise arrest?
fell off 326, and were the smallest in number since
1554. Is Tammany good to liquor sellers who break
the laws? And why, do you suppose? The number
cf arrests for keeping gambling-houses was smaller
than in any year since 1885. Is Tammany good to
the gamblers? And why? Ask the policy gam
keepers who put up $100,000 to secure the election of
Mayor Van Wyck. The number of arrests for the
violation of the sanitary code in 1899 was 284, com
pared with 519 in 180S, and less than in any year since
1555. Does this explain the increase in the death
rate in the East Side wards? Then look for the ar
rests for keeping disorderly houses in recent years:
1895, 4S8; 1896, 474: 1897, 506; 1S98 (Tammany rule).
2 37; 1899, 180. And yet the town is wide open, no
toriously wide open, compared with the days of the
Strong administration."
The importance of this new issue with which Bry
anism now confronts the people was strikingly pre
sented by the Hon. Frederick W. Holls in his address
on Friday evening. Commenting upon Bryan's talk
of the menace of imperialism Mr. Holls said: "The
danger of imperialism is real. If we should find any
where in this nation a section dominated by the will
of one man: if that cne man should be low and cor
rupt; if that section should be a great city and its
organization a great factor in national politics, then,
my friends, you have imperialism. You find it with
Mr. Croker and his vile Tammany crowd. You find
it in the men who glory in the fact that they live by
political blackmail, oft the dives of New York City;
in the organization of which Mr. Bryan had the
effrontery to tell the people of Syracuse, 'Great is
Tammany, and Croker is its prophet.' My friends,
there is the danger of imperialism."
BRYAN, in the exuberance of his delight over
the great parade and tumultuous welcome which
Tammany gave him on his recent visit to New
York, burst out with the exultant cry, "Great is Tam
many, and Croker is its prophet." When he uttered
those words he gave notice to the American people
that should he be elected to office Croker would be
a power in the administration. Thus Tammany be
comes a national issue. It is no longer a question of
its control of the city of New York only. It is a
question whether it shall be permitted to dominate the
politics of the whole nation.

That much .of benefit we may expect from the new
management of the Southern Pacific. Mr. Charles
Melville Hays comes to us like the advance agent of
business prosperity and political purity, so far as the
railroad is concerned. Should the promise be ful
filled he will have a welcome that will make his new
home dearer to him than any other he has ever had.
Such offenses have been not only a wrong to the
Republican party, but a positive harm to the State.
There is therefore much to rejoice over in the chang;
which promises either the retirement of Herrin or at
least an order to him which will compel him to give
his attention to the law business of the road; to
leave him no further time nor authority to do politics
with Crimmins and Kelly: no further power to use the
railroad influence to elect a disreputable man to the
United States Senate; no more railroad money to use
in supporting corrupt men in politics; no privilege of
any kind to neglect his duties to the business of his
office in order to fix slates for slum politicians.
What a prospect of coming good glows before Cali
fornia in the promise of this change! The elimina
tion of the railroad from politics would in itself be an
enormous gain to all the interests of the city. It is not
neceisary to go far back in the past to show the evil
that railroad politicians have inflicted upon San Fran
cisco and the State. The present campaign furnishes
illustrations enough. The people are aware that a year
ago the Republicans of this city drove Crimmins and
Kelly and their base following from the councils of
the Republican party. There was then even- reason
for expecting those men would never again have the
ability to place one of their tools on a Republican
ticket or to defeat honest Republicans when nomi
nated for office. That expectation was disappointed
by the Southern Pacific Company. W. F. Herrin, the
so-called head of the law department of the road but
in reality its political manager, brought Crimmins and
Kelly from the Mint saloon and from the slums of
politics and placed them again in a position of power.
Herrin even raised Kelly to a position from which he
arrogated the right to name the chairman of the Re
publican county convention and forced the nomina
tion for office of some of the most notorious of rail
road tools.
The hopes of Californians for such results from the
change in the management of the road are not without
good reasons to sustain them. Mr. Hays is known as
a railroad man. He is not and has never been a
political boss. He has made his way upward in his
profession by strict attention to business. His career
frcm the day he began in one of the humblest employ
ments of railroad work to that on which he was se-_
lected to be president of the Southern Pacific Com-*
pr.ny has been a brilliant illustration of success at
tained by legitimate work done with a strict fidelity
to every duty. The appointment of such a man can
hardly mean anything else than that the control of
the road has now passed into the hands of men who
intend to use it for business purposes solely and not
for politics. Such has been the record of those men
in tlfe past Is it not reasonable to expect they will be
true to that record in the future?
How great would be the change in the affairs of
California brought abcut by the elimination of rail
icad bosses from politics no man can fully estimate.
Nf ither can we fully foresee what benefits would flow
from the direction of the attention of the railroad
ivanacers exclusively to matters cf business and the
improvement of 'the transportation facilities of that
g r eat transcontinental Hne. It is known the corpora
tion has been a corrupting force in politics, and that
it has been negligent of the industrial and commercial
interests of the State. To have all that changed â to
have fuil attention given to railroad business and no
encouragement or aid given to political bosses would
be a consummation the very promise of which fills
the State with expectations of a new era marked
by commercial development and by political reform.
f~^ ALIFORNIA has reason to expect much in the
I way of benefit from that evolution in the affair*
of the Southern Pacific Railroad which has
brought about the election of Charles Melville Hays
ts president, with the establishment of his home and
headquarters in this city. The development promises
something like a revolution in the management of the
road. It gives hope that hereafter the energies of that
giant corporation are to be devoted exclusively to
business, and that it is not to interfere in politics or
be a source of support to corrupt politicians.
A NEW ERA FOR CALIFORNIA.
Such is the official report that comes to us from the
island. It shows a condition of affairs almost without
parallel in history. When we recall the long strife
between the Cuban? and the Spaniards and the fear
ful destruction of property and the abandonment of
industry that marked the course of that" strife there is
surely something to be proud of in the fact that within
so short a time our Government has established or
der, laid the foundations of prosperity, prepared the
way for independence and rendered the island so
flourishing that even the Spaniards themselves an:
flocking to it in order to share in its prosperity.
said: "This brings me to some most unhappy mis
apprehensions â not widely but influentially held in
this country â concerning the attitude of the Cuban
mind toward the United States and the present admin
istration. I assure you upon my responsibility that it is
an error, as complete as it is lamentable, that there is
distrust of the United States on the part of Cubans. A
few malcontents there are, as there must be always
and in every country and under any conditions. But
they are a mere handful, and there can be no greater
mistake than to interpret the ravings of these idiots
ac an expression of Cuban thought and sentiment.
The majority of the Cuban people â the Cuban people,
I may roundly say. the exceptions are so insignificant
â are friendly in the highest degree to the United
States, to the administration and to the resident repre
sentatives of the Government. With their friendliness
go perfect confidence in the purpose of the United
States to redeem every promise and unqualified con
tentment with present progress."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 28, 1900.
The ladles of Northhaven. for reasons
social and milllneristlc, are devoted ad
herents of Southhaven. They are greatly
shocked at Dean's unconventional meth
ods of forcing Southhaven's hand; his two
aunts try to dissuade him, but in vain.
Finally they call to their aid Mlllicent
Fell, a rich and beautiful Southhaven girl,
to whom Dean ts engaged. The play then
resolves itself into a contest between Kir
wan and Millicent for the soul of Dean.
At first It petms that Kirwan will win,
but at the crucial moment, when Dean la
to address the enthusiastic meeting called
to Indorse his policy, he falls. He has
The play Is a piece of symbolism so
plain that he who runs may read. The
seaport town of Xorthhaven (Ireland)
had allowed its industry to be ruined and
its trade diverted by abandoning to the
town of Southhaven (England) the control
of its line of municipal steamers. For the
exclusive commercial privileges thus ac
quired Southhaven had agreed to pay a
large sum of money, but had failed to
keep its agreement. The corporation of
Northhaven (the Irish members of Parlia
ment) is torn with internal dissensions.
Some in the pay of Southhaven oppose
all legal proceedings to recover the
money; others wish to recover the money,
but differ as to the means; others, again,
are Jealous of each other. The meeting
of the Town Council with which the play
opens is. Bedlam let loose. Order is finally
brougrht'out of this chaos by the persua
sive eloquence of one Jasper Dean, re
cently elected an Alderman. He Is that
born leader of men for whom Northhaven
has long waited. Inspired by the wisdom
and spirituality of his friend Kirwan (ge
nius of the Keltic race) he unites the jar
ring factions, who pass with but one dis
senting vote (Lawrence, Traitor and Spy)
a resolution directing- that Immediate le
eal proceedings be taken for the recovery
of the money.
GEORGE MOORE In the preface to
'Â¦ Ms play, "The Bending of the
Bough" (H. S. Stone & Co.). sets
forth some Interesting views on the
present condition of the drama. He
would scoff at Henry Arthur Jones' con
tention that there is a renascence of the
drama in England. Art In that country,
says Mr. Moore, is hopelessly dead; only
empire-making is alive. "Art is produced
in the youth of a nation, when the nation
is small, when national enthusiasm is
awakening and visions draw into an in
tellectual focus and the intellect of every
one is akin." Greece after the expulsion
of the Persians. Holland after the expul
sion of the Spaniards, England after the
Armada are examples of this. â¢ â¢ â¢ But
to-day art has left England. France. Rus
sia and Germany, according to Mr. Moore.
Where it will appear next he doesn't
know, but he hopes It will be in Ireland.
Abandoning London, then, as eternally
materialized. Mr. Moore and a few of his
friends have founded the Irish Literary
Theater in Dublin, where art is to be
practiced as much as possible for the Joy
of art and as little as possible for money.
"The Bending of the Bough" is the first
fruits of this enterprise. -
DEAN.
All Is alive: nothing Is dead- Through
That which Is you. which Is me. which
Is leading us. It Is a quality which never
ceases among us; each of us bears hJ3
spark of the magical power; now and then
a sr-ark blazes uj> into a "am* and the
fire fades down Into a spark; but the Ia3t
spark always remains. â¢ â¢ â¢ The gods
(of our race) live enfolded in the serenity
of the hills. "Why doubt the simple and
the beautiful? That. before the beginning
of the stars a breath came out of chaos,
orb after orb rounded and the vast sons
of nature flowed out. filling the spaces
with light and beauty awl ecstasy.

was considered. Attorney Riordan also
offered a general challenge to the Grand
Jury itself. Judge Cook overruled the
other objections and set the challenge to
the Jury for hearing next Saturday morn
ing.
The court then sustained the demurrer
to the complaint In the cases of Silva and
Simpton in the following importfcst de
cision: _
The demurrers filed hero and treating of the
question as to the form of the pleading and the
merits of the entire cases hare received the
careful consideration of the court. If the de
murrers rested upon the form of pleading alone
I should doubtless overrule them, but after
listening carefully to argument! on both sides
the court is convinced that the exceptions noted
as to the merits of the case Itself have some
weight.
The question la raised aa to whether the
charge In the indictment actually makes out
the charge of subornation of perjury, Â»Jid the
court entertains grave doubts on that point.
The same issue has been before Judges Troutt
and Slack, and the court takes that into, con
sideration aa well.
No time will bÂ« lost by the District At
torney in making his appeal to the Su
preme Court.
A trial here at thiÂ» moment lastlnsr weeks
yes, months â Involves the county In grreat ex
pense, and In view of the doubts entertained on
the point here made, the court la constrained
to eend the Issue before the appellate court
without delay, and thus get an Immediate rul
ing on the vital point set forth. The demurrers
are therefore sustained and the Supreme Court
may at once clear tho way for us, before we
proceed to trial.
TO the surprise of attorneys, court,
witnesses and loungers, Mrs. Net
tie R. Craven appeared in Superior
Judge Cook's courtroom yesterday
morning to answer to her name
when it was called In the case in which
she is accused of perjury. Mrs. Craven,
accompanied by a woman friend, entered
the courtroom on crutches. She said to
those who asked that she felt physically
improved, but she does not look so. Her
face has the stamp which serious illness
and suffering have made. She is weak,
emaciated and pale as death. She was as
sisted to a chair and in five minutes she
vas at liberty to retire. Her case had
again been postponed for a week, and a
decision given by Judge Cook in the cases
of Adolph Sylva and G. W. Simpton in
dicates that the Supreme Court will pass
upon questions of law before a jury in the
Superior Court passes judgment upon
matters of fact.
.Â¦When the case of Mrs. Craven was
called her attorney, Thomas D. Riordan,
announced that he was not prepared to go
on, as he did not know until a late hour
last night that Mrs. Craven would be able
to be present and he had not Issued sub
poenas for witnesses whom he will need.
Ho moved, however, that the Indictment,
found against Mrs. Craven be set aside
for several reasons. He Insisted that in
several respects the indictment is defec
tive; He contends that the names of wit
nesses examined by the Grand Jury have
not been appended to the indictment: that
persons not witnesses were allowed to bÂ«
present during the investigation; that evi-

ANNIVERSARY
ANCIENT ORDER
OF WORKMEN
Large Fraternal Gathering
in the Pavilion Last
Evening.
Th^re wÂ»rÂ» a.bout ten thousanii people
In the Mechanics' Pavilion last night to
assist at the celebration of the thirty
feeond anniversary of the institution of
the Ancient Order of United Workmen.
The hall was profusely decorated with
patriotic bunting, anchors and shields,
emblematic of the order. Every seat on
three fides of the hall on the pround floor
Â¦was occupied, while tier upon tier of seats
la the galleries were crowded, and neariy
five hundred people stood at the western
end of the large building. It waa the
largest fraternal gathering that has ever
aFsembled In this city. The special stand
f'Â»r the talent was occupied by those who
vera billed for the programme and by
Grand Master Workman C. E. Snook and
majiy of the grand officers.
After several selections by the Park
Hand Past Grand Master W. H. Barnes,
president of the evening, made a few ap
propriate remarks concerning the occasion
of the meeting and then introduced tho
California Quartet, which rendered "The
Blue and the Gray," and for an encore
fang "A Fairy Tale," composed by Grand
Receiver Sam Booth, descriptive of Work
rranphip. ' Mrs. Blake-Alverson sang
";Viva L* America," and was followed oy
Grand Master Workman Snook, who In a.
ten-minute address told the large audience
a great deal about the order and what it
has done in the thirty-two years of it3
existence. Then Miss Ada Shean sang
the "Holy City" and a ballad in a sweet
contralto voice, after which Billy Hynes
entertained with comic songs. The pro
frramme cloeed with an exhibition drill by
the team of Pacific Lodge of Oakland,
Mrs. Walter Malloy accompanist. This
terminated with the formation in living

MRS. NETTIE R. CRAVEN, SUPPORTED

27
When the natural and constantly re-
curring Incidents peculiar to our sex
are perfectly normal, a woman may be
sure she is healthy, and not until they
are should she rest satisfied. All kinds
of expedients may be resorted to by
women to hide the ravages of time and
suffering, but they are one and all bar-
ren of permanent result for good while
unnatural and excessive pains and
aches exist. >,' -
I really believe women deceive them-
selves about this, and I believe, too,
that they do not receive positive in-
struction about it from physicians. I
have known lots of women who suffered
torture about one-fourth of the time
until I prevailed upon them to write to
Mrs. Pinkham. Even then, they were
at first inclined to think they had to
go through these experiences Just be-
cause they are women. But they took
the advice they received, and found
they had been very foolish to wait so
long before getting help.
It Is a mystery to me that a woman
will deliberately allow herself to suf-
fer, will willingly forego her right to
the delight of living, will knowingly
resign herself to premature old age,
when at her hand is this helper and
sustainer that has done so much for
others. If your back Is beginning to
round, if the lines are creeping into
your face, if you do not feel so pert as
you should, do not forget that the
cause of these troubles is easily found,
and easily overcome.
It Isn't as If there were no way to
avoid these troubles. Everybody knows
of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound, and what it has done to help
women who are the brightest specimens
of our sex to-day. It is a simple thing
to do if a woman really cares about
herself, to take Mrs. Pinkham's medi-
cine. I have seen so much of the good
it has done that I want all women to
benefit by its virtues.
In fact, most of the old age that
creeps only too early upon women, most
of the fading away of the brightness
of the face, are due to lack of watch-
fulness of the organs of the sex. Month
after month women suffer and grow old
from the natural functions of our sex.
given that we might be rejuvenated,
and renewed as time goes by â given
as a means ' of enhancing female
beauty. Yet month after month these
unnatural pains go unheeded: week
after week the aching backâ Nature's
warning that something is wrongâ 13
neglected, until health Is broken, and
beauty gone. Oh! that women might
realize their position, and know that
upon themselves depends their own at-
tractiveness.
Cleanliness Is not a mere washing of.
the body or even an occasional bath.
I have known women who got Into a
tub two or three times a week, tfn-
gerly rubbed themselves with soap, and
thought their duty ended. The woman
who knows makes her bath as regular
as her meals. Nor is she content with
water baths alone. Sun baths she
takes, and air baths. Whenever possi-
ble, she spends an hour a day In a wÂ«ll-
ventilated room, with no clothing on
but a light garment, through which
the air may pass freely. She spends
time outdoors, warming her blood in
the sun, cleansing her lungs with the
fresh air. Â»
There Is another law of cleanliness
so often neglected by women â th<s
use of the vaginal douche. The body
needs to be clean Inside and out, if
perfect physical beauty Is to result, and
nothing is more important than the use
of the warm douche every morning up-
on rising.
How do they make themselves at-
tractive? Not by powder and paint,
not by any artificial device. Eternal
vigilance Is their watchword. A care-
ful guard over the health, and over
those weaknesses by which women so
readily succumb to old age. Good looks
to-day are the result of cleanliness,
physical perfection and a bright brain
combined.
When one thinks of it, It's queer how
little mere prettlnes3 counts these days.
The 1 word itself has a weak, insipid
sound that we hate. A hat or a gown
must be smart, not pretty; a woman
must be well groomed, must be handled
in a way which shows that she knows
her good points and nan made the best
of them. The attractive women of
to-day â the women who are wor-
shiped by men and women alike â *tre
those who. if they had lived a few
years ago, would have been considered
too old to enter into the active pleas-
ures of life. And they do not look old.
They have all the attractions of youth,
all the experience of age.

T. I. Fltzpatrick, Democratic candidate
for Justice of the Peace, is making a hard
and vigorous fight for the, office, and from
present indications it seems almost cer-
tain that he will be one of the five elected.
He has been fortunate in gathering about
him a host of friends, old and young, who,
irrespective of their party affiliations, are
assisting in every district of the city, and
his canvass Is thoroughly organized* and
well directed. Mr. Fltzpatrick>is a young
San Franciscan, highly educated, of un-
questioned legal ability, exemplary moral
character and possesses in an eminent de-
gree all those qualifications so necessary
to the . Impartial Judge. He has had a
wide and varied experience, in the practice
of the law, and has already attracted the
attention of the older members of the
bar, who predict for him a successful ca-
reer In his chosen profession. "We take
pleasure in recommending him for the of-
fice to which he aspires, having full and
implicit confidence in his ability to know
his whole duty and to perform it thor-
oughly and conscientiously in every cane
brought before him. . â¢

WILLIAMS PROVES TO
BE A FALSE FBIEND
Accused by Mrs. Knowltcn of Steal
ing Ser Gold Watch and
Bracelet.
Frank Williams, alias Contreras, ap
peared before Judge Fritx yesterday on a
charge of grand larceny. He is accused
of stealing a gold watch and bracelet
from Mrs. A. Knowlton, 25 Fulton street,
while on a visit to her.
Mrs. XCnowlton testified that she â¢went
to San Jofp to attend the funeral of her
mother, and on returning on the 6teamer
from Alviso she was introduced to Wil
liams by her niece, who had been intro
duced to him by a lady friend. Williams
Â¦was very kind .to them, and on arriving
here assisted them with their baggage
and bogged to be allowed to call. He
called on one or two occasions, and the
last time he saw her put her bracelet on
top of the piano and her watch on top of
her bureau drawer. He asked for a glass
of water twice, and each time she went
to the kitchen to get it.
When Williams left a few minutes aft
erward she missed her bracelet and gold
watch, and on looking out of the window
saw him running down the street. No
one else could have taken the articles.
The case was continued till Tuesday.
Neither of the articles has been recovered.
Williams was also charged in Judge Mo
fran's court yesterday with obtaining
groods by false pretenses. He is accused
of getting a $30 suit from a tailor on
O'Farroll street by representing that he
â¢was connected with a firm in the city,
which representation was found to be
false. The case was continued until to
morrow.
The Board of Education made an un
fllgr.ifled attempt yesterday to coerce Mrs.
Irene D. Reeves into an agreement where
by she is to withdraw a suit now pending
In the Superior Court whereby she la
seeking to be reinstated. As the price of
withdrawing the suit. Chairman Mark in
formed Mra. Reeves that she would bÂ«
assigned to one of the five positions to be
filled at next "Wednesday's meeting.
The matter came up yesterday at a se
cret eefslon of the board. Mrs. Reeves is
now on the substitute list, to which ehe
was assigned last February. She had
been given a class in the Hawthorne Pri
mary School, though holding a hlgrh echool
certlflcate. This was done at her own re
quest, however, she having filed a request
with the last board on October 10, 1S99, In
order to be temporarily relieved from
more onerous duties. After being consoli
dated out of the Hawthorne School, the
board refused to recognize the high school
standing of Mrs. Reeves, and reduced her
in jrrade by placing her on the substitute
list. The board contended that by the
mere fact of having requested to be given
a primary class, even though it was but
for a temporary period only. Mrs. Reeves
had forfeited her high school standing,
ilrs. Reeves took issue with the board
and brought suit to be restored to her or
iginal standing in the department.
IÂ»!rs. Reeves had learned through The
Call that five new positions would be filled
by the board next Wednesday, in accord
ance with the priority of service rule, and
that ehe was one of, the five on the eligible
Il5t.
Mrs. Reeves asked Chairman Mark
point blank at the session yesterday if
the board proposed to appoint her to one
of the places. Mark replied that so long
as Mrs. Reeves would persist in her suit
apainst the board she would not be recog
nized as a member In good standing of
the School Department.
"Unless you withdraw your suit," paid
Mark to Mrs. Reeves, "you will not be ap
pointed lo a position."
Mrs. Reeves pleaded that the simple
fact that she was seeking to be reinstated
as a hieh school teacher through the
court's aid should not interfere with her
earning a living. Mark, however, stated
that so long as she refused to accede to
the board's request she would not be re
garded as eligible for appointment or as
a member of the department. The incon
sistency of this remark is apparent when
it Is known that Mrs. Reeves is now in
receipt of a salary as a substitute teacher.
Mrs. Reeves declined to enter into any
such compact as suggested by the board,
which thereupon reiterated its determina
tion not to appoint her to a regular posi
tion.
* At the close of the conference Mrs.
Reeves, who was extremely agitated.
Ftated that her hli?h school record was
such that she could not think of waiving
her rights as a hiph school teacher.
"Directors Mark and Denman," said
Mrs. Reeves, "both agreed that if I with
drew my suit I would certainly receive an
appointment. I refused to entertain the
propoFition and the board would not yield
it* point. I taught in the Polytechnic
Hiph School for many years and 1 am
eure the pu.ills will ail testify to my
ability."
If the board persists In Its Intention to
refuse an appointment to Mrs. Reeves It
will be a g-ross violation of the chronolog
ical order which the board has pledged
itself to observe. No reports have been
Jiled agrainst her by principals, so the
board cannot take refug-e behind that
pica. All that Btands between Mra.
Keeves and en appointment Is the fact
that ehe is trying: to obtain her rights by
due process of law.
Unless She Agrees She Will Miss Ap
pointment, Though Chronolog
ical Order Shall Be
Violated.
Insists on Mrs. Reeves With
drawing Her Suit for
Reinstatement.

LATJNCH OF THE PERftY.
THE well-known coasting schooner
Five Brothers is , a total loss at
Double Point, near Drakes Bay.
Bhe left here on October 12 ' for
Bihlers Point and was driven
ashore twelve days later, after battling
with head winds and gales until the crew
was worn out. Soon after the Five
Brothers went ashore the fishing' steamer
Henrietta took hold of her and attempted
to get her off, but failed. The captain
and crew were saved, but nothing now
remains of the schooner but her bones.
The Five Brothers was owned "by the
firm of Johnson & Emlgh, and was a com
panion ship to the Seven Sisters. The
late Captain Johnson 'had a family of
twelve childrenâ five boys and seven girls.
The girls were older than the boys, so the
Seven Sisters was built in 18S8, while the
Five Brothers was not launched until 1896.
Both vessels are well known o.n the
coast and both had been very succeesf ul
u^ to the time of the accident to the Two
Brothers.- When last heard from the
Seven Sisters was at Cape Nome.
Up to Friday night the captain and
crew, five all told, struggled with every
power they could command to get the ves
eel off. Last night they realized the hope
lessness of their efforts and abandoned
their craft to the waves and rocks. The
schooner etruck in a thick fog and was
thrown on the rocky beach. Towering
high above her was the 200-foot bluff. She
lay within thirty feet of Its foot. All night
long the captain and crew never left the
doomed vessel. Long, easy swells gently
i raised ? and -dropped her on the Jagged
i rocks, rending her hull. Daylight came
and the little crew wÂ«nt to work to save
her. Hawsers and anchors were run out,
and when the tide served repeated efforts
were made to drag her off. The lines
broke when pitted against thÂ« tootnliKO
rocks that held her. The fishing steam
er's lines broke and she could do nothing.
The lltttle crew did not give up. Like
ants under the shadow of the frowning
cliffs above them, they still worked. Every
thing was 1 thrown 'Overboard, and they
Etlll hauled and- tugged with windlass and
winch, by day '-and- by night 'Â¦ While the
sea was still they had hopes, but yester
day the high running waves began' to
make fierce assaults upon their boat, ana
, they had to give up the battle and seek
safety In night. They climbed a trail that
led up the -cliff. It Is said there is not a
mast or timber of the schooner but what
has been ground to splinters.

The check was presented at the bank

Professor Wltthaus reported to Coroner
Hart to-day that In his chemical analysis
of the stomach of William Marsh Rica ha
found mercury and arsenic
In his report he gives the result of the
analysis of certain organs of Mr. Rice
which he received from the Coroner and
of embalming fluid received from the un
dertaker who embalmed the body of Mr.
Rice. The fluid. Professor Wltthaus says,
contained beside formal de hyde the fol
lowing mineral Ingredients: Potassium,
sodium, zinc and aluminum, sulphuric
acid, arsenious acid and chloride. The
embalming liquid contains no mercury.
The report continues: "The analysis of
the stomach and of the intestines for
vegetable poisons hare given negative re
sults. The analysis of the stomach or tha
Intestines and of the kidneys for volatile
poison failed to show the presence of any
foreign substance, other than formal da
hyde a constituent of the embalming
liquid mentioned before. The analysts for
mineral poisons referred to below has
not yet been carried to the point whera
zinc would appear. That metal may or
may not be present. The stomach was
found to contain arsenio In notable quan
tities and an unwettrhable minute quan
tity of mercury. The presence of tha
arsenic In this and the parts mentioned
below would be accounted for If the em
balming liquid, a sample of which I ana
lyzed, had been used In preserving thl3
body. The intestines were found to con
tain both arsenic and mercury. The quan
tity of mercury present In the sample ex
amined was found to be .0OS6 grams In ISA
grams of tissue, equivalent to seventeen,
one-thousandths grains per ounce of 480
grains.
"The kldnÂ«y contained arsenic and mer
cury also. The quantity of arsenic has
not yet been determined. The quantity
of mercury present In the sample exam
ined was found to be .00S1 gram it in 167
grams of tissue, equivalent to .023 grains
per ounce.
"I would infer from the very small
quantity of mercury found In the stomach
and the relatively large amount found in
the intestines and In the kidneys that
metal In some ' form of soluble combina
tion had been introduced in the body dur
ing the life of the deceased, probably sev
eral hours, possibly days, previous to bia
death."
Coroner Hart said he would report Im
mediately to the District Attorney's of
fice, and that a time would be set for a
conference at which Professor Witthaua
would be present. He said that on the re
port of this conference a date would tea
set for an inquest.

membership of 25.000. Slnco July the
membership has been Increased from less
than 100 to over 3500. Organizers are about
to gt> on the road in a grand tour of the
counties, their itinerary taking them from
San Francisco as far north as Reddlns
County and to the southern end of tho
State and through the towns and cities
of the great San Joaquin Valley. The
party will consist of William B. Smythe.
W. H. Porterfleld and Harry W. Gllmour,
all of whom have taken an active part in
the work of securing members up to date.
Mr. Gllmour will go ahead and make the
arrangements for the meetings to be
held and to him Is assigned the duty of
making ail the public addresses. Mr.
Porterfleld will solicit memberships and
do other propaganda, work that may be
found necessary. The start will be made

the territory and to return to San Fran
cisco before the annual convention of tho
Water and Forest Association, which will
take place about the middle of December.
Modesto will be the first place visited.
Then the propagandists will go up to Red
ding, making stops on the way, and will
also go as far east as Nevada City. Then
they will travel down the coast to South
ern California and come up the San Joa
quin Valley, holding meetings at many
places and doing the best missionary work
they can. The purpose Is to educate the
people concerning: the advantages of the
work proposed. Within a few days the
reports of the geological and hydrograph
lc surveying parties will be ready to make
public These will be accompanied by
maps, which will make good educational
matter. Nearly every stream In the State
in the arid or semi-arid regions has been
surveyed and mapped and the reservoir
sites haveÂ» N been set down. The reports
will . be very valuable and interesting.

"My dear brethren, let us study to-night
what a saint and when the
church makes one. We all know that
sanctity is the gift of God, and that he
will impart it to others.
. \'^Y e , nnd in tne saints all the virtues
faith, hope and charity; also prudence
temperance and justice. If we act up to
all these virtues we can all be saints. We
are always looking to do something he
roic. Some of the saints distinguished
themselves by some brave deeds, but yet
they had all the virtues. The church has
canonized kings, queens and great men
but she also has her doors open to you if
you wish to become a saint. Communion
with God is essential. The /moment we
discontinue prayer we lose m trength. A
great man is JuBt the opposite to a saint
The statesman needs influence,' power and
friendship. The saint does. not require
any earthly assistance. He looks to God
for his strength."

A neat sum was realized at the Stan

for the benefit of the Amendment Club of
Stanford. The wet weather kept many
away, but despite this handicap there was
a generous attendance. The college stud
ents were generally subdued, but at va
rious times during the evening they broke
forth in familiar yells. â¢
Johnny Briscoe proved an acceptable
stage manager. His excuses for the
tardy appearances of certain stars were
witty and well taken. "Brick" Morse
proved the all-round man of the enter
tainment. He led the California Glee
Club, played the banjo, acted as substi
tute in a quartet and did a clever mono
logue turn.
Mr. Olshausen of Stanford rendered
solos on the flute and his artistic work
won deserved encores. The Stanford glee
and Mandolin clubs sang and played. The

passed, but not an answering shout for
Bryan came from any of them. Tho meet

SAN RAFAEIi. Oct. 27.â Despite a
heavy rain, tho Republicans of this
city held an enthusiastic rally at the
opera-house this evening. Samuel
M. Shortridge waa tho principal speaker.
After having: been Introduced by Chair
man Robert Furious, who made a short
preliminary address, Mr. Shcrtrldge held
the close attention of his audience for
two hours. He ridiculed thÂ» Democratic
cry regarding trusts. All the legislation
that the national statute books contained
relating to the curbing of the trusts, he
said, was passed by a Republican Con
gress and sanctioned by a Republican
President. What remedy did the Demo
crats offer for the trusts? What laws
did they propose to pass?
The Democratic contention against a
large standing army was next taken up
In connection with the cry of Imperialism.
He showed that this country had not as
many soldiers as policemen. The speaker
here added that every man who wore thÂ«
uniform of his country would gladly dla
for the flap, and the insinuation that they
would ever turn traitors to their country
was an Insult.
The speaker's' eloquent periods were
heartily applauded by the audience. At
the conclusion cf the meeting three rous
ing cheers were given for McKlnley and
Roosevelt, and the meeting . adjourned.

Fan Krarcisco. Ho was mot by a
committee at Milton. The crowd at the
tneetinp place to-night wi^s the largest
that has ateno>a any political demonstra
tion here in years. Mr. Knight was in
troduced by H. I. Blood and spoke for
two hours. Speaking of the cause of the
war with Spain lit told how- the Cubans
v . . r .. starred until the United States could
no longer refrain from interfering. When
the war was over Bryan laid aside his
vnlform and went to Washington to work
for the peace treaty which he was now
denouncing. He traced the expansion of
the fnited States from the thirteen States
ty purchase and bv co-quest to its present
/ tr^atnf-fs and showci that American
f 5 at?smen had always favored expansion.
The speaker contrasted the condition of
the workinjjmen of this country with
thoFÂ«> of "other nations. He said America
fca<T advanced to a plane where the older
powers would listen to our counsel; that
ve were the arbiters of peace. He de
rouropfl Bryanism as bad for the coun
try, and ppoke of the Ice trust, with
Croker and Vnn Wyck at it? head, as the
vorst trust that could be found in the
land.
Speakinp of Sam D. "Woods' candidacy,
Mr. Knight said it was necessary to up

Why are the national banks opposfnj me?
Because their presidents and stockholders know
that I waa on the Senate Committee for Bank*

would tax any other property.
Why ar# the different coast representative

they know that If elected my party and I are

Carrlran. Levl. Haas, not to forget Gogwnhelm

Because they forget that my father. mÂ»
brothers and I have always been Intimately
connected with the development of this State,
and particularly of the Sar. Joaqutn VallÂ»y.
They forget, or perhaps never knew, that my
father was the pioneer wheat grower on thÂ«

They know that I know that the prosperity
of the State depends upon the prosperity of the
small fanner and workingman and not th*

know that If elected I won't go lecxlng about

"Why Is Irving M. Scott opposing my candi

THE rally of the Bryan and Steven
son clubs of the University of Cal
ifornia and Stanford University at
Metropolitan Temple last, night
reached the high water mark of
Democratic rallies of the campaign. There
was more enthusiasm, more entertainment
and more of brilliant, effective speaking
than any previous meeting had produced.
Former Lieutenant Govrenor Jeter pre
sided, except during the strictly college
part 'of. the programme; for which Frank
Karr of Stanford Introduced C. W. Ed
wards of California as chairman. J. F.
English and James Ferguson of Stanford
and J. O. Osborne and James M. Koford
of California delivered addresses that held
the closest attention of the large audience.
A trio from the Bryan and Stevenson Club
of Stanford sang campaign songs between
speeches, and received more generous ap
plause than has been given any campaign
glee club or quartet that has sung In
Metropolitan Temple.
J.* H. Henry, candidate for Congress
from the Fifth Congressional District;
Galllard Stoney, candidate for Superior
Judge, Robert M. Flfzgerald and R. Por

Fourth Congressional District, made short
addresses. . " .'^ .'_,-,-
. Mr. Ashe, the last speaker on the pro
gramme, was called for several times ear
lier in the evening by impatient .admirers,
and when he was finally Introduced he
was received with loud and long-continued
applause. In the course of his speech he
paid his respects to some of his op
ponents as follows:
I am opposed In my candidacy by all the
newspapers published dally In this city and
county. Irrespective of political afilllatlons â by
the Republican Federal offices and transport
officials, and by the so-called Julius Kahn
Business Mens" Partisan Club. I wish to say
la this connection that were It not for tho
Democratic loyalty of Mr. Barry of the Star,
Mr. Jack Bonnet of Town Talk, and my
friends of the German press, my candidacy
would be unheard of and unsung, among: tboas
who look to tho dally and weekly Journals for
political news and advice.
Why are the Federal officeâ¢ and the trans
port officials opposing me? Because the office
holders know -what I will do to them when Mr.
Bryan Is inaugurated and commences to ad
vise with me regarding their efficiency and use
fulness, and the transport officials don't want
me in Washington because they know that I
will keep my word, given to them In their
teeth down at the windy transport docks last
week, and that I will have a law passed In
Congress prohibiting the employment of alien
labor in the transport service. They know that

Farnsworth addressed a large meeting
here this evening. The speaker's strong-
kins and Attorney General Tlrey L. Ford.
The procession which led the way to the
meeting was composed* of all of the
marching clubs Â«ln this part of the State.
The entire route was lined with cheering
crowds. Most conspicuous among the
clubs In the procession was that known as
"Teddy's Terrors." uniformed like the
Rough Riders that Roosevelt led. The
"Terrors" marched down the street, fir
ing pistols and giving war whoops. The
Amerlcus . Qlub of Pasadena, one of . th>?
largest marching clubs in the. State, per
formed numerous evolutions for the edi
fication of the spectators.
Hazard's Pax'ilion, with a seating capac
ity of 4500, was packed to the doors. Sen
ator Perkins, held the attention of this
vast audience for almost an hour and a
half. He showed the Democracy's incon
sistency In assisting to force the Spanish
war upon the country and, after support-
Ing the ratification of the treaty, con
demning Its consequences. The Senator
explained that the interests of California
were closely interwoven with the Repub
lican policy of expansion and predicted
an overwhelming victory In November.
Attorney General Tircy L. Ford talked
of trusts and of Bryamsm. He referred to
the action of Bryan in supporting the in
surrection in the Philippines . as being
treason. With biting sarcasm he de
nounced the comparisons made by Bryan
of Washington and Agulnaldo. Mr. Ford
said that the . Republicans were - better
united this year than they had ever been
before. He predicted that McKInley's
majority would be greater than any that
had ever before been given to a Presi
dential candidate.

VIEW THE OUTLOOK
ed to the Presidency in 1S96, Mr. Wolf said,
speaking of the past four years:
During 1 this time the financial center of na
tions has v*esed from London to New York.
Why? Sly friends. It Is the effect of confldenc*,
of capital'* confidence resulting from the bene
fit! which have accrued to the country from
the able administration of that great and good
man, William McKlnley.
Now as to this strike, which the IVmocrats
are attempting to make political capital out
of. Why do these men strike? Because they
want to get *ome of the universal prosperity
that the country is at the present time enjoy
ing. If the bosses didn't have the money to
give the men would' nt strike for It.
I tell \x>u that as to expansion the original
Democratic party stood for expansion, true ex
pansion. (A voice. "Chestnuts'.") That man
who Just cried chestnuts Is probably a good
Democrat and I'll tell him that we'll pile up
more and more of such chestnuts until we've
buried Bryan under them.
Bryan eays gold 1* arrogant and tyrannical.
He savs In time of war jrold will leave a coun
try. We have had a war under a gold admin
istration. Has eold left the country? No, you
know, every one of you men here to-night, that
we are probably better off to-day than we were
before that war which Mr. Bryan eald must
bring- financial disaster In Its train. And so
Â¦wtth all his prophecies. Even' single doctrine
that Bryan promulgated, every statement he
has made, has proven to be false. Xow, I ap
peal to you, appeal to you as solid men, as men
of common sense, should the false prophet of
IS96 be the President of 1901?
It Is perfectly legitimate for manufacturing
Interests to combine. If by so doing they make
a email profit on the article they sell, and the
purchaser gets It for a fair price. Such In
dustrial combinations are not trusts, but are
a healthy stimulus to trade, ut great as Is a
labor union to the cause nt the working man.
Why. my friends, the trusts (pernicious Indus
trial combinations) were dealt a fatal blow by
a bill introduced by that stalwart* Republican.

until Thanksgiving day. when the stud

overwhelming victory by tlie varsity
eleven, which will retrieve the defeat suf
fered by the freshman team yesterday at
the hands of the cardinal aggrega-tlon.
On the other hand, there is Joy in the

will wax enthusiastic when they recall
the game. For the score was 5 to 0.

whistle blew the signal for hostilities,
they were Imbued with hope, and when

stood five points In favor of their team,
their hopes went bounding upward and
they saw victory within their grasp.
At this stage Berkeley rooters still had
confidence In their team and cheered on
their representatives with as much fervor
as they had early in the contest. Their
encouraging shouts, however, did not

CHICAGO. Oct. 27.â The largest crowd
of the season witnessed the match race
between Advance Guard and Florizar,
which was won by Advance Guard after
one of the most sensational struggles ever
6Â©en on a Chicago track. A blanket
would have covered the two from flag
fall to wire. First- one and **hen the
other would show no*e In front, but
fifty yarda from the wire the Carruth

drew away, winning hard ridden by a
neck. The contest proved a gipantlc bet
ting affair. They first opened at .evpn
money. Then piles of money rolled in
on Advance Guard, causing his odds tn
be cut to 7 to 10 and Florizar went up to
6 to 5. The track was fast and th*.

VANCOUVER. Oct. 27.â A tig shipment
of California fruit for Australia is in the
Canadian Pacific freight sheds here. It 13
held In bond and there is a serious prob
lem among the customs authorities as to
what can bÂ© done with It ThÂ» shipment
Is from San Francisco and consists ofV
more than 400 large sized boxes of apple* y
and pears. They were destined for Aus
tralia and were to have been shipped by
the last steamer, the Miowera, sailing five
days ago. The vessel refused to carry
them on the ground that the New South
"Wales Government recently declared a
quarantine against California fruit, on the
ground that It was affected with codlin
moth. Inspector Cunningham of this city
says 'that the apples were sent from San
Francisco before this was known and that
therefore no blare can be attached to the
shippers. No arrangements have yet been
suggested for the disposition of the fruit.

SAN FRANCISCO. - V
Although the 6core of the game at Rec
reation grounds yesterday afternoon was
close enough to be exciting, few heart
palpitations were produced by the very
proper and gentlemanly baseball perform
ed by the Athenians and the Wasps. The
Wasps did their stinging In the sixth in
ning, when a brace of runs on two hits
topped Oakland's run achievement by a
single stroke. The 6core, 4 to 3, at tho
end of the sixth, was respected by both
parties and remained unchanged.
Iburg was on the slab for Frisco, and
although he did not pitch remarkable ball
was always on deck at critical times with
a series of "unsolvables." Borchers
twirled for the Dudes in good style. He
was found only seven times.
In the first inning Oakland led off with
a run. Drennan did a bit of single work,
committed petty larceny in gaining an
other point, advanced a station on a wild
throw and scored on Francks' hit. The
score was soon tied. Brockhoff, who found
himself safe on first on Francks* error,
scoring on a good single by Pabst to far
The second Inning registered a run for
Borchers and later on one for Sullivan,
whose two-bagger and a couple of timely
hits by assisting friends enabled him to
score thus making the board read two all.
The tie was shattered in the fifth, when
Francks crossed the rubber for the Dudes
after two deaths. In the next inning the
Hanksmen won the game. Krug and
Pabst. singled and Sullivan, who swatted
a stiff Jolter to left field, scored both.
"Sully" was too anxious to reach third,
so he cut the second bag out of his course
and was promptly cut out of the game
for a time by Hughle Smith for so doing.
The score: OAKLAND .

Both teams came on - the field In the
second half freshened and ready to fight
every inch of the way. The pigskin moved
up and down the field considerably in this
half. Both teams had to give the ball up
because they could not make their dis
tance. The half was full of features.
Sherman made two brilliant runs around
left end. Kennedy plunged through holes
made by Young and gained yards every
time his team needed it. Lunt, the prom
ising Varsity left end, was compelled to
leave the game by reason of a dislocated
shoulder, and It Is probable that he will
not be able to resume his playing this
season. Coach Yost In his excitement
told his team what to do, . and Murphy
penalized his college mates. The brilliant
forty-yard run made by Sherman counted
for naught, as his interference held Bans
bach just as the little quarter was ready
to tackle the runner. Taylor's straight
bucks earned his team many yards.
Fautz, fullback for Berkeley, worked
hard, but the Stanford players played even
harder. When the whistle blew the end
of - the game Stanford had the ball on
Berkeley's forty-yard line. . ...
Pandemonium broke loose as the game
ended. The Stanford students rushed on
the field and grabbed "Captain Bansbach
and Yost and carried them around the
field on their shoulders. The yell leader
headed the cardinal band and 400 happy
Stanford students marched yelling over
the field. It was a striking picture and was
enjoyed by everybody who did not wear
the blue and gold colors.
when time was called.
During the intermission Coaches Kelly
ami Yost took their respective teams in
hand and pointed out mistakes that could
be remedied, and the weak spots of the
rival team.
thizers. Pretty girls wearing the colors
of the rival colleges waved their flag's and
ribbons after every exciting play. The
volume of sound that poured forth from
the student bodies of both universities
could have been heard a mile away. Both
colleges had their bands In attendance
and enlivening inarches were played dur
ing the intermission and before the game.
A great deal of badinage flew back and
forth among the students and this was a
source of amusement to the spectators.
Stanford was reminded that Berkeley still
possessed their ax, but the Palo Alto boya
only howled their derision. Tho rah, rah,
rah of Stanford and the Osky! Wow!
Wow! of Berkeley rent the air throughout
the game.
Coach Yost received a glad reception by
his Stanford friends and Coach Kelly was
greeted with the Princeton yell by the
blue and gold rooters. -When "Loll"
Pringle, captain of the California varsity
team, came on the field in a carry-all, he
was cheered as was also Overall, the
giant freshman, who was disbarred from
playing by reason of charges of profes
sionalism being filed against him by Stan
ford. Â¦ â¢
Stanford's team was first on the field
and a great shout greeted them. I The
wearers of the cardinal did not put much
life Into their practice and the hearts of
their friends dropped many degrees. The
cheers that greeted the Berkeley boys as
they trotted on the field, dressed in new
sweaters with conspicuous '"04," was
double that accorded their rivals. This
was due to the presence of twice as many
rooters as Stanford had.
Berkeley won the toss and chose the
eastern goal. Stowe, with a mighty kick,
put the tall into play and the game was
on. Kennedy caught the pigskin and ran

For years physicians have experimented
In vain seeking a remedy which would
effectually cure piles and similar rectal
troubles without resorting to surgical
operations. Â» ; Â¦.Â¦
Many (?alves, ointments and other reme-
dies were found to give only temporary
relief, but none could be depended upon
to make a lasting, satisfactory cure.
Within the past few years, however, la
remedy called the Pyramid Pile Cure has
been repeatedly tested in hundreds of
cases and with highly satisfactory results.
The first effect of this remedy Is f.o in-
Ftantly remove the pain and irritation and
from that time on the cure rapidly pro-
cTPPse?, a-nd before the patient is hardly
aware of it he Is entirely cured.
The Pyramid Pile Cure seems to act di-
rectly upon the nerves and blood vessels '
of t'he parts affected, as it comes into
direct contact with them and sets up* a
healthy action which in a perfectly nat-
ural way reduces the swelling and in-
Â¦ â¢ tianamation.
The Pyramid Pile Cure performs the
cure without pain or inconvenience to the
pufferer and is Justly considered one of
the most meritorious discoveries of mod-
ern medicine.
Files Is a most annoymj? and often-
times dangerous disease with which hu-
manity is afflicted. If neglected it fre-
quently develops into fistula or some fatal
or Incurable rectal trouble, whereas by
the timely use of this simple but effective
remedy no one need suffer a single day
from any form of piles.
The Pyramid Pile Cure is perfectly
harmlesp, contains no mineral poison,
opiate or dangerous drug of any kind.
It is in suppository form composed of
emollient oils and astringents, and Is ap-
plied at night and absorbed into the parts
affected during Blerp. ' â¢_Â«*

she was greatly mistaken, as h!s mother
lived nearly 4000 miles from this city.
It was definitely leaxned last night that

TRUSTEES AGAINST
PROPOSED HOSPITAL
BERKELEY, Oct. 'SI.â According to the
ordinance which the Town Trustees or
dered framed last night the Berkeley Hos

The action of the Trustees was due to the
objection of residents la the neighborhood
of the site selected. .'â¢'â¢ "'Â¦ 'Â¦:.
The original ordinance, which had been
passed to print, regulating the establish
ment of hospitals specified that- no such
Institution other than a Receiving Hospi
tal could be established within 1500 feet
of a dwelling. This was amended to read
"within 100 feet of any dwelling," the
part referring to the Receiving hospital
being stricken out. As the residence of
Ira Sorrlck is only 40 feet from the house
on Channing way Â¦which the association
proposed to buy and fit up for a hospi
tal a new site will have to be selected.
Trustee Staats favored giving the asso
ciation the right to establish the hospi
tal on Channing way. but he was op
posed by the other Trustees.
Dr. J. S. Eastman addressed the boar.1.
explaining that the institution was to be
in the nature of a receiving hospital and
not a place for contagious diseases. He
said it could not prove to be a nuisance
In any way. -The lobby was filled with cit
izens, who objected to having the hospital
in the present site selected.

whether she performed her household du

wound up by roundly abusing her with
his cruel and cutting language. Mrs. Hall
stood the epithets as long as she could,
she states, and then gave up trying to
please her husband.
Hall was the central figure of the great

here to-night in Music Hall, when Presi

breaker boys of District No. 1 with a solid

crowd of over 2*Vjfl of the little follows
gathered in the hall when President Mlt

placed on him by Vinnle Phillips, a 10

A large and enthusiastic meeting of the
friends of T. I. Fitzpatrlck, Democratic
candidate for Justice of the Peace, was

permanent organization was effected and
more than a hundred members signed the
roll. The following officers were elected:
President, John J. Barrett; vice president,
JOFeph Greencberg; secretary. George. A.

The following members were constituted
an executive committee: J. J. Lerman

Fitzpatrlck's Friends Organize.
The stems of thÂ«Â» flowers were all placed
In a hollow bamboo frame filled with a
porous substance to retain moisture; this
keeps the flowers looking crisp and bright
and has the great advantage of simplicity.
As yesterday was the last of the ex
hibition an even larger crowd than at any
other time was present.
An attractive exhibit was the uniqueiy
decorated dinner table by Miss C. F.
Smith. In the center of the table, which
is of unpolished ebony, was an effectively
disposed heap of black and white grapes
and autumn tinted vine leaves. Long
slender branches Â¦were run out from the
center to the edges of the table. The ser
vice was delicately hand-painted to match
the centerpiece, and light was furnished
from candelabra supporting shades of
vine leaves. In the corner of the same
room in which this table stands was a
canopied corner effectively draped with
trailing Oregon moss.
The balloting for the finest chrysanthe
mum excited* much interest. There were
four flowers in the contest, owned by Mrs.
Hohwe!sner, Frank Pellcano, Demoto
Brothers and A. Carbone.
Professor Emory E. Smith's pink pam
pas plumes were a center of Interest to
novelty jÂ»eÂ«kerB. The variety was the re
sult of much careful selection, and Pro
fessor Smith Is congratulating himself on
having created something new in pampas
plumes.
The following awards were made:
Alvord gold medal, to Frank Pellcano.
Glbbs gold medal, to the Domoto Brothers.
Silver medal for b*st amateur general col

Frank Pellcano had a contrivance on
exhibition at the California Floral So
ciety's flower Fhow in Sherman & Clay's
Hall which !s expected to take well with
table decorators. Heretofore In arrang
ing floral pieces the paramount difficulty
has been to keep the flowers fresh and
bright during an entire evening. Peli

come this. The sample he had on ex

The "Symphonle Fantastlque,". chief In

Its difficult' rhythms, unusual : phrasings
and disconnected^, periods were handled
with rare clearness and precision,' and the
grotesque splendor of the composition, : Its
wild diablerie, its gorgeous, forbidden col

fine truth, of inspiration.: But: the sym

Coongratulatlons, Conductor Hlrschfeld,
on rtie distinguished success of the first
symphony concert of the season.
On Thursday afternoon last a represen
tative- but not a large audience gathered
at the Tivoli Opera-house to welcome and
criticize the director of the Tivoli forces
in the new role of symphony . conductor.
Mr. Hlrschfeld has made many friends by
his familiar work in operatic directions,
and has added to his admirers by his re
cent record in grand opera, but even the
warmest and most enthusiastic of these
were surprised at the excellent character
of the work done on Thursday last, and
those who had feared and prophesied
to the last degree and supremely Interest-
Ing, it is yet morbid, decadent and ille
gitimate art. Â¦
The first movement, "Dreams and Pas
sions," somber, sensuous, mystical, with
a certain savage beaÂ«ty in places, and
again wandering into comparative dull
ness, was beautifully given. The waltz
like second movement. "At the Fete," is
as commonplace as it was possible for
Berlioz to be, and lacked somewhat in
lightness and grace in the rendering.
About this, a prominent musician tells
me that at a dinner in Paris, at which he
and the composer were present, Berlioz
expressed a considerable dissatisfaction
with the symphony, with, the raconteur
Imagines, a particular reference to this
second movement. The third scene, "In
Sylvan Surroundings," has some exquis
itely lovely Â¦ episodes, delicious meander-
Ing melodies of flute and oboe, beautifully
played by the way, as was also the solo
on the kettle drums. In which the roll and
tone gradations" were splendidly given;
but the movement lacks climax and could
be cut to advantage.
It is In the last two movements, how
ever, "The March to the Gallows" and
"Witches' Sabbath." that Berlioz shows
his peculiar quality, strange and uncanny
and sensational to the last degree; ab
sinthe inspired, one might irrevently im
agine, were not the composer's normal
temperament df this abnormal character.
"The March to the. Gallows," with its
grotesque grandeur and magnificent at
mosphere of horror, lifted the audience
from its feet and prepared the way for
that eeriest of all compositions, the last
movement of the symphony, known as
"Inferno," or. more fastidiously, as "ThÂ©
Witches' Sabbath."
The "Inferno," as Mr. Weil in his val
uable translation of the programme notes
has christened it. exhibits in its fullest
extent the wonderful power of Berlioz in
orchestration. The thing is diabolically
clever. The violins shriek and gibber, and
flash notes of unholy glitter through the
infernal medley. An illimitable gloom, pos
sessed by every seen, felt and known hor
ror. Is suggested with uncanny power,
and, too, the awful glee, the impish,
mocking laughter of lost souls; the de
moniac merriment of fiends who welcome
another fallen creature to their frightful
orgies, is heard with horrid clearness.
Really,. one would almost prefer to avoid
one's neighbor's face after hearing the
"Fantastic Symphony." . :
As to the remaining numbers of the
programme the overture, "Im Hochland,"
a beautiful, tranquil movement by Gade,
was rendered with fine smoothness: the
"Kaiser March" of Wagner, - a little
ragged at the beginning, went afterward
well; the rather trivial. "Dance of the
lights" was prettily given, and the "Wal
kuren Ritt" went with admirable ease.
The tempo of the Mozart number. "Alia
Turca," was too slow in my Judgment,
but the whole concert was profoundly
interesting and as a tentative effort in
symphony directions unusually encourag
ing, i
â¢ â¢ v
"Unusually encouraging," that is, to
those 'who have naught to do but enjoy
the results of the large effort that is In
volved under the most favorable condi
tions, in the giving of a symphony con-'
T, e , rt * .Unusually-: encouraging to Mr.
Hirschfeld and the fine band of musicians
gathered together under his baton, it can
not have "been. The house was hardly
more than half full, and of course 4id not
pay expenses, though : it is true, as tho
familiar phrase has ' It, that what the
house lacked in numbers It made up In
enthusiasm.
But the history of symphony move
ments in this city is not encouraging: At
the outset it is not clearly understood
here that only in rarest Instances any
where do symphony concerts "pay" from
a financial standpoint, and never any
where until after a considerable period
from their inauguration.- It goes without
saying in Eastern cities where it is de
termined that orchestral concerts are a
musical necessity that a list of guaran
tors, financially representing anywhere
from $20,000 to $50,000 for annual expense*
is the first essential to their : foundation!
When Chicago decided , to engage the
Thomas orchestra it cost the public
spirited citizens at i the head of musical
matters there from $20,000 to $30,000 an
nually for the privilege, but Chicago must
have anything .that New York has and
gets it because she is willing to pay.
..The' Cincinnati symphony concerts do
not pay, have never, paid. I doubt if the
Boston s concerts are a financial ~ success,
and the splendid : symphony orchestra of
Plttsburgr, which glvea eighteen evening
and eighteen afternoon concerts during
the season and is insured financial safety
by a guarantee list of flfty-two members,
rarely falls to draw upon its generous
guarantors.

Our own symphony society, a regularly
Incorporated organization since 1S99. has
for a directive board Mrs. Phebe A.
Hearst, president; Mrs. J. N. Odell, sec
retary; Dr. V. R. Taylor, vice president:
P. M. Lillenthal, treasurer, and Robert
Tolmle, J. M. Goewey and Harold "Wheeler,
directors. â¢ Six symphony concerts of the
highest possible merit were given' last sea
son under the direction of Mr. Holmes in
the Grand Opera-house, and at prices to
suit the slimmest purse. Of course, there
was a t jflcit, and because the unusual
phenomenon of a balance at the bank had
been the result of the previous season's
experience this very natural state of
things called down the most unpardon
able criticism and suspicion upon the sym
phbny management. There is. however, a
fund of something over $1000 in hand, for
Mrs. Hearst, with utmost generosity,
shouldered the incurred debt, and in spite
of the unkind discouragement and criti
cism of last seasonâ which represented the
larger portion of the reward received by
the board of management â the concerts
will probably be revived when the grand
opera season Is over, probably some time
In January.

The recital of Frederic M. Blggerstaff,
given on Tuesday evening last in Sherman
& Clay Hall, was very well attended. Mr.
Blggerstaff was formerly a pupil of Pro
fessor Lesser of this city and has but
lately returned from European study with
Barth and Moszkowski. The pianist was
assisted by Mrs. Sedgley Reynolds, con
tralto. Perhaps the best number on Mr.
Biggerstaff's interesting programme was
the Mendelssohn scherzo from the "Mid
summer Night's Dream." the light, crisp
touch and cool, polished elegance that Us
best rendering demands. The artist '
seemed at home In the Mendelssohnlan
atmosphere, and tha Schumann""Novel
ette" was also given with verve and fin
ish. Finish, polish, restraint and a cer
tain self-consciousness are the prevailing
characteristics of Mr. Biggerstaff's meth
od: color, warmth and climax are rarely
in evidence. The artist has a clean tech
nique, a crisp, cool, perhaps rather shal
low touch, and his readings, while schol
arly and dignified, are not individual. The
rest of the programme ran as follows:
Sonata Appasslonata of Beethoven; the
Chopin A flat Etude, nocturne. â¢ op. 62. ballade
op. 23; prelude of Rachmaninoff; an Intermezzo
of Brahma and the "Caprlc* Kspanol" of Mosz
kow ski.
Mrs. Reynolds* songs were "Ah! s"es
tlnto" (Mercadante). "Romance" (Nleder-
meyer), a pretty "Berceuse" by Mr. Blp
gerstaff. "A Columbine" (Massenet). "Aim
der Ju?endzeit" (Radecke) and "Songs
My Mother Taught Me."' by I>vorak. Mrs.
Reynolds has a full, sweet voice, charm
ingly used, but somewhat uncertain of
Intonation at times.

Catarrh "Is a Lingering Cold Which
Refuses to Yield to Ordi-
. nary Treatment.
Catarrh usually starts with a . cold in
the head and if left unchecked In this
climate rarely gets well of itself.
.As fresh cold is taken the disease
spreads,' getting deeper and deeper, creep-
Ing: along .'the ..mucous membranes from
nose to throat, from throat to windpipe,
from windpipe to Dronchial tubes and
from bronchial tubes to lung cells.
The mucous membranes all connect one
with another. Hence It Is easy to spread
from one part to â¢ another lined with : this
same membrane. This is why catarrh in
the head soon affects the throat and fin-
ally the stomach - itself, bringing on
chronic catarrh of the stomach, which U
a most obstinate form of dyspepsia.
Everybody is now well agreed, that ca-
tarTh is a blood disease and not a local
one, and the attempt to cure by local ap-
plications simply srlves temporary, relief
from the purely local symptoms without
the remotest effect in staying the pro -
gress of the disease.- -
There iÂ» anew preparation recently of-
fered to the' public that is apparently
destined to do away with every other form
of catarrh treatment. . ''JMBpu|

medicine, \ but is a_ large, pleasant - tasting
tablet composed of Saugulnaria; Eucalyp â¢

able and .-, harmless specifics. . which are
taken Internally and seem to have a^ re-
markably, beneficial effect :upon : the blood
and mucous ,, membranes, apparently
eliminating the catarrhal poigon ; from the
whole Â¦ system." .Y i -.t . ; ,
These tablets. wWle being pleasant, con-
venient and: absolutely safe to .use. have

JCETVC TORK. Oct. 27.â There was a very
manifest disposition to eell stock to take
profits to-day. The appearance of an unex
jiectedly favorable bank statement gave a mo
laectary check to the downward movement,
tut the rally waa taken advantage of to In
crease the EellS&g and the whole list gave way.
closing weak and at the lowest prices. Net
losses of between one and two points are
recorded in not a few stocks In the Industrial
end railroad lists. The former department was
the greater sufferer. Some stocks had a period
of strength after the opening, notably Sugar,
Brooklyn Transit and Metropolitan Street Rail
way, which eame stocks were mostly affected
1 y the late selling movement. The Iron an1
Â»teel Etocks as a group were weak In tpite of
encouraging reports of the Industry in the
weekly commercial .^reviews. Several of them
ruffered to the extent of 1 to % per cent. In
the railroad list the most conspicuous selling
Mas In Missouri Pacific aa the lateat stock to
be Fubjected to unwarranted rumor* to ad
vance it, followed by authoritative denials.
Southern Paciflo continued heavy in eplte of
the deciEion upon the new president. The
Readlnga were quiet. There waa a disposition
about the exchange to deprecate thÂ« excessive
tendency of the speculation and the broadness
of the methods employed in some quarters.
The systematic end periodical dissemination of
bull canards was felt to endanger the stability
of a market where buying waa based upon
such Cimiy grounds. The week has been one
of great epeculatlve activity in Etocks and ha*
afforded opportunity to marKet very lar**
dealings. Tha development of an outside de
mand i.as been accompanied by . manipulation
of piioes In the Interest of speculators long
of clocks. The successful efforts to get prices
up have resulted in handsome profits In the
selling to outside buyers. That many of the
buyers bad In view merely a speculative opera.
tlon. hoping for a continued rise in operations
which would result in a profit on a resale,
was evMent from the selling pressure which
developed in the advance and which turned
prices backward. But the bull interest on the
exchange constantly shifted their opportunities
to new quarters of the stock list and kept the
epeculatlve Interest awake by developing new
price movements. Nearly e\-ery day during the
-neck brought forth publications alleging far
reaching changes in control and in plans for
operation of greater railroad properties or al
lied or connecting systems, with promises of
colossal results In profits. Looking back over
the week lt is noticeable that these etorles
have failed of ootiflrmation and In many In
stances have been conclusively denied, so that
after the first upward Jump of the etock it
haa fallen back in price and tÂ«come com
paratively quiet in the *p*culatfr/ii. It is an
ln\'ariable incident of a bull marliet that after
the professional operators haye worked through
the list of stocks and exploited ail those avail
able for a rlM and sold their ltoldlngs they
will become aa lndustrloua In sowing dis
couraging opinions regarding future values as
they were before in expressing confidence.

CLOSING,
There 1* confirmation of the report of the
borrowings from the bank yesterday, but lt Is
understood that these were to meet some
Stock Exchange requlrementa and not for
money necessities. It is rumored that the
bank Intends soon to take action with a view
to securing control of thÂ» money market.
The American department was especially
quiet. Opening prices were about at parity
and they hardened later on buying- for tha
Continent. Money was somewhat easier.
The market* here were deserted to-day, Not
withstanding the postponement of the arrival
and reception in the city of the Imperial Vol
unteers, almost everybody had gone away at
for a holiday.
NEW YORK. Oct. 27.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
London Market.
NEW TORK. Oct. 87.â The Financier Bay*:
The statement of the Associated Banks of New
Tork City for the week ending October 27 was
not of a surprisingly favorable character, the
gains in cash holdings especially attracting- at
tention. The known operations of the week in
dicated that tho banks had lost money, both to
the Treasury and to the interior, but bo far
irom showing this the averages reveal an ac
tual gain ct ?2,324,S00, both specie and legal
tenders sharing in the expansion. By any safe
rule of calculation this Increase cannot be
accounted for, although the peculiar working of
the system of averages from which the state
ment Is compiled has at times In the past
resulted in even more astonishing results. The
gold moving from Europe within the past few
days could not have figured fully in the state
ment and the Treasury disbursements In bank
operations were also too late to show to the
largest extent. Probably if the exhibit Is
really correct local operation* with other Insti
tutions must bo credited as responsible. At
any rate, the statement as suggesting, that
lt reveals the true condition of the banks Bets
at rest the question of money rates for the
immediate future. The gold in transit from
Europe and the consignments received from
Australia and other sources will add appre
ciably to the reserves of New Tork Institutions,
but lt Is an Interesting question whether loans
will continue to contract In the volume shown
over the past month. The ehrinklng of $4,464,
600 in this item elnoe October 2 was about as
expected, although Stock Exchange operations
during the six-day period had been unusually
active. Deposits have been reduced $3,041,300 by
reacon of the lessening of loan commitments.
It is evident, however, that tJie statement does
not balance, even approximately. There Is rea
eon to believe that the drain which thÂ« interior
banks have made on New York this fall is
nearly at an end, but local bankers believe that
the return of this money will be slow and will
not figure appreciably In the statement under
the end of the year. Perhaps the first evidence
cf the turn of the tlds will ,be eeen in con
traction of outstanding national bank notes,
the volume of which has been Increased $S4,
000,000 In a year. These notes are scattered all
over the United States and any redundancy in
circulation will operate toward their partial re
tirement. The elasticity of national bank nots
currency .under the new law, however, is yet to
be tested.

the apprehension over the money outlook. It
had been feared that such a withdrawal ol
rold would have dangerous consequences in
Europe, which is still cut off from Its former
source of Bupply In the Transvaal. That
European markets have been undisturbed by
this movement is partly due to the skill 'with
which the exchange operations have been
handled. American agents have scoured all
out of the way Eources for floating supplies of
gold in order not to encroach on the supplied
in the great central institutions abroad. The
week's receipts of gold in New York have kept
the money rate down, though the demand for
credits Incident to the speculation has not
been without effect. An Incident of the week
has been the continued advance of silver to
the highest level in four years and the ap
parent culmination of the rise and slight re
action.

From telegraphic news from Mansfield.
Ohio, it is learned that the will of John
Sherman. was taken to the Probate Court
there yesterday by Congressman W. 8.
Kerr of that city and Attorney M. M.
Parker of Washington, D. C. â¢ It -Is -a > vo
luminous document and .written" entirely
in the hand of the maker: It la calculated
that the estate is worth $3,000,000.
The original will was made at Washing
ton December 22. 1SS0, and a codicil was
drawn January 22, 1900. After making va
rious bequests to, distant . relatives and
public institutions the residue of the es
tate, estimated "to be Â¦ worth $2,400,000, Is
willed share and -share alike to Mary
Stewart Sherman. (McCallum), daughter;
Henry S. Sherman, son of Brother
Charles; Hoyt Sherman.- son -of. Brother
James; Hllemon Tecumseh '.Sherman,' son
of W. T.; Charles H. Sherman, son of
Brother Lampson. Sherman,. and. Charles
M. Sherman, son of Brother Hoyt. The
executors are M. M. Parker -of , Washing
ton and W. S. Kerr of Mansfield. ...
Charles H. Sherman has, been employed
as an assayer in the San Francisco Allnt
for nearly twenty-five years. He has lived
with his , family at 1448 Caroline street,
Alameda, for about five', years. He Â¦ has
three children â Tecumseh P. Sherman, C
Hoyt Sherman and Miss Jennie Sherman.
Charles H. Sherman was a nephew of
the dead soldier and, statesman, and the
news that he will come in for such a
large share of his uncle's immense estate
reached him through the press- dispatches.
No. official notice of his good fortune has
been sent him. v
Charles H. Sherman, .who for' many
years has worked in the ; San'; Francisco
Mint and who now resides modestly : on
his modest salary in Alameda, will re
ceive $400,000 from the estate of ex-Secre
tary of State John Sherman, who died a
few days ago.
Mr - Sherman's eldest son, Tecumseh, was
until recently attached to one of the Gov
ernment transports. He is now employed
In the Mint. '.,Â¦Â».. .
"I have received no further Information
regarding my uncle's will than what has
appeared in the press dispatches," said
Charles H. Sherman ;Â¦ this evening. "His
estate is a valuable one and the figures
published are,- 1 think, very nearly cor
rect." . -

WJLJb'JzJrS BUTT DRIVES
VANDOB TO AN ASYLUM
Is Recovering From Injury When
Summons Is Served â Decree -
Granted and Suits Filed.
Pauline Vandor, mother and guardian
of Joseph Vandor, now an Inmate of the
Stockton Insane Asylum, filed answer yes
terday to the complaint for divorce filed
recently by A^nee Vandor, wife of her
unfortunate son. Her son's present condi
tion. Pauline Vandor says, is largely due
to the action of his wife In Instituting
puit for divorce, in which she prays- for a
decree on the ground of cruelty.
In 18S7 Pauline Vandor says her son was
Injured In a street car accident, and his
Injuries unbalanced his mind. In Novem
ber of 1S99, she continues, she took him
to her home in Fresno, and he was
progressing favorably until summons in
his wife's action for divorce- was served
upon him. He then became a raving ma
niac, she says, and she was forced to send
him to the asylum. She denies the other
Mrs. Vandor' s allegations of cruelty, and
asks that' Judgment be entered In favor of
her son.
Josephine Peterson has been granted a
divorce from Daniel S. Peterson on the
ground of willful neglect.
Suits for divorce were filed vesterday by

Bishop Clinton Is 42 years of age and is
a native of South Carolina. He was edu
cated In the public schools and afterward
attended the State University, from which
be graduated with high honors. He then
entered Livingstone College at Salisbury.
N. C, where he studied theology. He has
been in tho minietry twenty-two years.
He founded the A. M. E. Zlon Quarterly
Review in 1&S9 and edited It for hr^ e
years. He was then olected editor of the
Star Zion, the leading denominational
Journal, and devoied four years to his
important work. In May. 18%, he was
elected Bishop and blr.ee then he has been
prominently before the public.
The reverend gentleman left South
Carolina in the middle of September last
and has traveled through the States of
Tennessee, Mississippi and Arkansas.
During the past week he has been Jour
neying through this State.
In discussing the recent legislation af
fecting negro citizenship Btehop Clinton
expressed the opinion that the legislation
was unjust and unnecessary, especially In
North Carolina. "
"It is my opinion." he said, "that there
has been a steady effort on the part of
the Democratic party of the South to nul
lify the constitutional amendments which
gave to the negro citizenship and equal
suffrage rights. These efforts began first
bv the introduction of the seven ballot
box system, as In South Carolina, and that
the recent constitutional amendments are
the culmination of this effort to rob the
negro of his citizenship and suffrage
rights there can be no question. It is my
opinion that the negro, especially the In
telligent and progressive men of the race,
would have no objection to these meas
ures if they applied with equal force to
white men of the same qualification.
"It cannot fall to have a bad effect to
discriminate againet the negro â flrst be
cause It bases citizenship upon coloi
rather than on qualification of character;
secondly, because it works an injustice
upon people who have honored their right
to citizenship In every contest in whicn
the nation's honor has been at stake,
whether on the field of battle or in obey
ing the laws of the State and nation.
"Despite these things, the negro Is still
making progress along all substantial
lines, especially in the way of acquiring
an education and accumulating property.
As an example, our own church, the A.
M. E. Zion, operates seven educational in
stitutions, one of which owns fifty acres
of land as a campus and buildlnsrs valued
at $125,000. It is situated at Salisbury,
N. C."
