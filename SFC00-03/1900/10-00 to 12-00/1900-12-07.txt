Maxwell to-day promised the labor men
that all of the 2300 fraudulent naturaliza
tion papers Issued during the last six
months to Japanese would at once be re
voked, and with cheers the crowd declared
that the Asiatics would be driven out of
the country. Both political parties admit
to-night that the Introduction of the race
cry of the English against the French by
Sir Charles Tupper was the primary
cause of the defeat of the Conservative*
here. It is a blow at the Introduction of
religious strife in the campaija.
VANCOUVER, B. C. Dec. 6.â After one
of the most bitterly fought campaigns
ever seen here, the Liberal govern
ment was sustained to-day by the elec
tion of Rev. George R. Maxwell to repre
sent Vancouver In the House of Commons
at Ottawa. Maxwell's majority in Van
couver city alone was 740. An attempt
was made to poll the votes of recently
naturalized Japanese, but the plan was
abandoned early In the day. Not a Jap
anese showed himself at the election
booths, although the courts a week ago
decided that 2000 of the Japanese cou!J
legally exercise the franchise as British
subjects on election day. The returning
officer, however, gave instructions that no
Japanese would be allowed to vote, and
if any of the Orientals had come within
sight of the polls a riot would In all prob
ability have occurred. At 4 o'clock this
morning a special messenger from Jap
anese Consul General Shlmlsu visited the
Japanese lodging-houses all over the city
with instructions to the Japanese British
subjects not to attempt to vote. ; A littla
later an armed committee of the labor ex
ecutives visited the same houses' and Inti
mated that if any attempt was made by
the Japanese to vote they would simply
be killed. This advice had the effect of
keeping the Japanese Indoors, for not one
of them showed his face on the streets
during the day.
LIBERAL VICTORY.
"This suit instituted by Grover," he
said, "Is a blackmail suit I am not
the tool of Jeter," nor a dummy
director. I own the stock in the corpora
tion. It is true that in' the affairs of
Grover & Coi In relation to the banks
there have been some irregularities" arid
some mistakes, but j they have not been
serious, and ,-' I , am not ,~ responsible \ for
them. The flrm of Grover & Co. was in
solvent when : I entered it. I . received no
salary *or anything I have done for tho
"Every allegation of conspiracy, fraud
and dishonesty made in the suit is un
true. . Every charge that I have placed
dummy directors in the company Is a
falsehood and Grover knew it when he
placed the allegation in his complaint.
This suit illustrates what men must sub
mit to under our scheme of government.
A complaint In court becomes a privileged
communication, and although nothing be
proved or be offered as a subject of
proof, the person at whose' head a string
of epithetÂ« be flung must submit.
"I again most emphatically deny that
there is the shadow of fraud In our trans
actions with Grover & Co. or that there
is the remotest element of Justice in their
claims against us. The suit is now on
trial and the court will determine the is
sues."
Logan Says the Suit Is Blackmail.
Sfx-Judge J. H. Logan, characterized in
Grover' s complaint asa dummy director
of Grover & Co. and the tool of ex- Lieu
tenant Governor Jeter, was also emphatic
in his denials.
"We did not accept a share of stock of
the corporation," he said, "in payment
for those Grover notes. There was an
adjustment and settlement of our claims,
but we did not accept stock In an insol
vent corporation in satisfaction for our
claims. This eult of Grover against the
banks is an unjust fabric of misrepre
sentations and falsehoods. .
In this disagreeable affair there is one
transaction that has aroused the greatest
bitterness on both sides. In Grover*s
complaint tho allegation is made that the
Bank of Santa Cruz County and the Santa
Cruz Bank cf Savings and Loan' released
an indebtedness of $40,000 owed by D. W:
Grover and Hannah F. Grover, and .re
ceived absolutely for the release^
except 1100 shares of worthless stock in
the corporation of Grover &. Co., which
was then insolvent. Notes representing
$19,509 G5 in indebtedness are in evidence in
tho case. They show that the Grovers
paid not a cent of interest upon them,
and that in June, 1897, they were re
leased. Including the interest with the
principal, these notes aggregated $23,260 30.
Around this sum of money particularly

The ' Story of Canceled ; Notes.
In discussing the various issues of the
case which has created such a sensation
in the town Attorney Frank M. Stone,
representing L. F. Grover, spoke to-day
as follows:
"As an attorney representing one side
of a case presently pending In court I
dislike to enter Into a discussion of : the
questions, involved therein. The Call
sought an interview with me prior to any
publication of the article under, discus
sion and I declined to make "any state

havo had no professional relations with
Grover & Co. or any of the Grovers from

of them owe me anything! nor have they
in years. \
"It was an amicable suit and what I
did was done in order that attorneys'
fees might be saved. I received nothing
for my services. That is all there is tu
that incident. As for me being a tool of
Governor Jeter that is a lie. I am not a
dummy director and Grover knows It.
Every charge he has made against me is
false." .Â¦Â¦'...
H. E. Maklnney had less than :â¢ Judge
Logan to say on the subject, but he was
none the less emphatic In his denials of
the charges made by Grover against him.
He Is the law partner of ex-Lieutenant
Governor Jeter and one of the directors
of Grover & Co. As a director of Grover
& Co. he brought suit against his own
corporation for the bank and his traveling
expenses were paid by the bank and
charged against Grover & Co. In. discuss
ing this affair' Mr. Maklnney said:
"In the complaint it is charged that I
accepted for the- company as a voucher
expenses charged by the bank to Grover

but it was not fraud. I simply, wish to

THREE OF THE MEN WHO FIGURE PROMINENTLY IX THE/ SENSATIONAL SANTA CRUZ. LITIGATION, IN
WHICH THE MOST SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS ARE Ma'DE AGAINST PEOPLE HIGH IN POLITICAL, SOCIAL
AND PROFESSIONAL LIFE IN THE STATE. . ;. . . 7 . . â¢. .
Seaton, who was then lnÂ»the house, heard
fsj EATTLE, Dec. Câ Armed with a
(S*^ sharp and heavy wood ax an-l
SJ moved by some unknown anil
bloodthirsty . impulse, William
Seaton between 3:30 and 4 o'clock
.this afternoon attempted the murder of
four persons at -the home of his mother
at South Park, seven miles from Seattle.
As a result o* his murderous attack his
uncle, Dan Richards, lies at the Morgue
with his skull crushed In, the result o*
blows from the ax, and with a bullet hole
through his chest.
His sister, Annie Seaton, is In a hospi
tal ward. . She received three glancing
blows from the ax and is severely wound
ed about the head anil back. There is
hope for her recovery.
Her two little stepdaughters. Myrtle
Hapgood, age 7. and Hazel Hapgood, age
5, who were the flrst victims of the at
tack, are hovering between life and death.
Both received heavy blows on the head
from the ax and Hazel will live but a
few hours. An operation has been per
formed upon Myrtle and she has a small
chance for life.
Seaton now occupies a cell In the City
Jail, with a bullet wound through his
neck, received from,,Deputy Sheriff Mike
Kelly while resisting arrest. Seaton
fought with desperation 1 for his liberty.
He tired eight shots in Â£.11. The only dam
age resulting was a slight flesh wound to
John Kennedy, a neighbor who attempted
to enter the house while Seaton was still
there.
The entire attack upon the members or
the family occupied but a few minutej.
The little girls were the first victims of
his fury. They were playing In a stable
in the rear of the house, where he was
splitting wood. He attacked them with
an ax, striking them in the head with
the heavy weapon. Their apparentiy
lifelesa bodies he threw into the manger.
Their screams reached- the ears of theJr
stepmother/ Annie Seaton, who was see
ing in the house. She ran toward the
barn and was'met near the door by hÂ«r
brother,;' who knocked her down wjth.tha
! ax. He struck her another blow while
she lay prostrate, but In his excitement
the blow was wild and she managed to
get away, clearing at a single leap a high
board fence and escaping to the house of
a neighbor. Seaton then continued on
to the house. His uncle, Dan Richards,
lay sleeping in the front bed room. Sea
ton struck him three times on the head
with the ax and then got a revolver and
shot him through the breast. The ax he
left standing beside the bed.
After tho, crime the instinct of self
preservation apparently seized Seaton.
and he closed and locked the doors of the
house. Three neighbors who attempted
to secure an entrance through the rear
door met with a warm reception. Five
bullets were fired through the door, one
of them taking effect in the back of John
Kennedy, but- not seriously wounding
him.
A few mjnutes later Seaton left the
house and walked toward the station at
the end of the car line/ a distance of a
little more than a mile. To such neigh
bors as he met he told the story of his
crime and announced his intention to give
himself up. At the station he was met
by" Deputy . Sheriff Mike Kelly. The offi
cer demanded his surrender, but Seaton
started to run. He went but a few feet
and then turned and began shooting.
Three shots were exchanged. The third
bullet from the officer's gun caught Seat
on In the heck, and he fell upon the street
car trestle. He recovered sufficiently to
crawl upon the car. without assistance
and did considerable talking during the
trip to town, although badly choked with
blood. His wo'und Is not serious.
Through all the crime a little babe, the
11-months-old daughter of Annie Seaton.
lay sleeping .in the room in which Dan
Richards was killed. It was not molested,
and when the house was searched was
found in peaceful sleep. Mrs. Mary Lar
kina, the mother of the murderer, was
the only other member of the family who
escaped. She was in Seattle at the time
and did not return until it was all over.
The news of the crime Is being kept from
her, as it is feared that It would mean
her death." *
No possible motive can be assigned for
Seaton's terrible crime, except on the
ground that he Is a moral degenerate. Of
himself and the other members of the
family practically nothing Is known. They
came to Seattle from Illinois about a
year ago. They moved to the residence
in South Park about six weeks ago. The
murderer has been employed as a day
laborer in E. C. Squires' stave factory.
Richards was a. carpenter, but had not
been working recently. Annie Seaton has
been twice married; the children were the*
daughters of Hapgood, her flrst husband,
by a former wife, but were being taken
care of by her.
Myrtle Hapgood , returned from school
at about 3 o'clock, changed her dress, and
went out to the stable to Join her sister.
As near as can be learned it was Just
as she came that the mad Impulse reached
a fixed determination in Seaton's head.
Hazel ' was standing beside a stall, he
broke her skull with the ax and threw
her body into the manger. Just then
.Myrtle came in the door. <He turned and
struck her just as he had her sister. Her
body he threw in on top of the other. The
head of one of them struck the wall back
of the manger and spattered blood over
the.boards. The little girls, were able to
give utterance to several screams. Annie
"I see absolutely nothing In his mental
condition to warrant a belief that the man
is crazy." said Dr. McKechnie. "His
statements are both rational and co
herent. To sum It up In a few words, my
opinion of him is that he is undoubtedly
a degenerate, probably as the result of
generations of ancestors of similar short
comings, but he is not Insane."
The only statement that Seaton madÂ©
during the whole of the evening which
would in any way tend to indicate a de
ranged brain was as he was being locked
up for the right: "Whenever I get mad I
am so mad that I don't know what I am
doing."
"There are hundreds of people who
could truthfully say the same thing who
are not murderers, and nÂ»Â«Â«Â»r will b* "
was the remark of I>r. McKechnie. who
overheard the statement.
At the City Jail to-night Seaton talked
freely of the crime, calmly giving In de
tail every particular. He said: ."Yea, I
killed them all.' My tister was the cause
of the trouble. She is not the woman
that she ought to be. She would not do
: what was right. I was cutting wood In
the backyard of our home when I con
cluded to wipe out ay troubles. I went
to the barn with the ax in my hand. My
sister's stepchildren were playing: in thu
barn. I heard their voices from my placa
at the woodpile., I entered the barn and
saw Hazel standing in a stall.
"I struck her with the ax and then
caught the other one. This was Myrtle.
She ran around the stall and tried to es
cape, but I caught her just the same. The
ax was handy on the floor, and I killed
her, too. Then I threw the bodies In the
manger.
"Then this woman, my sister, came run
ning out of the hourÂ» and asked me what
I was doing. I opened the door and struck
her on the back of the head with the ax.
She fell down, but I hit her again. The
third blow which I aimed missed her and
the ax went deep Into the ground. Be
fore I could regain control of the weapon
my sister ran across the lot and jumped
a high fence. I then went into the house,
thinking that I would dress myself and go
to the police station.
"As I entered the front bedroom I saw
my uncle, Dan Richards, lying on the bed
asleep. The Impulse seized me, and re
turning to the porch, I seized the ax and
struck him a blow on the head. He sat
up in bed and tried to talk. I struck him
again, this time with the blade. Tea, I
know the blow kilted him."
Then the murderer again grew defiant.
"If It is the will of the law let them
hang me," were Seaton's last words.
City Physician McKechnie to-night ex
amined "William Seaton to ascertain
whether his demeanor was that of a per

LORD ROSEBERY, FORMER
PREMIER OF GREAT BRIT
AIN.
LONDON, Dec. â¬.â The feature of
the session of Parliament to-day
was Lord Rosebery's spirited at
tack on the Government. He
was unsparing in h!s criticism of
the dissolution of Parliament, the conduct
of the war. the policy cf the Government
toward China and everything handled by
the Cabinet. He caustically commented
on the reconstruction of the Cabinet, con
gratulating Lord Salisbury on being the
chief of a fa.iraly numbering so many able
rcmir.istrators, the reference being to the
-.-.elusion ir. the Cabinet of several of Lord
Salisbury's relatives.
Lord Rosebery's comment on the
charges against Mr. Chamberlain, the
Secretary of State for the Colonies, was
pr-vere. He deprecated overbelief in the
credibility of all the charges, but said It
was evident the head of the Cabinet had
failed in proper supervision and the pride
of England in the purity of its public men
had suffered.
Short Speech From Throne,
A few minutes after the Speaker, Wil
liam Court Gully, had taken his rhair in
the House of Commons this afternoon the
sentlcraan usher of the Black Rod. Gen
era! Michael Biddulph, appeared and sum
moned the Commons to the House of
Lords, where the Lord Chancellor, the
E.-.ri of IieJsbury. read the Queen's

"My Lords and Gentlemen: It has be
come necessary to make further provision
for the expenses incurred by the opera
tions of my armies in South Africa and
China. I have summoned you to hold a
special session in order that you may gi\ - e
your attention to the enactment required
for this purpose. Tou will not enter into
other public matters requiring your at
tt ntion until the ordinary meeting of Par
liament in the spring."
A number cf ladies were present at the
proceedings in the House of Lords, but
the peers present numbered less than a
Â»}<-,rtn, apart from the four royal com
mlntopen representing the Queen, among
whom was the Duke of Marlborough. The
o-remor.y was very brief.
Remarks of the Lords.
TVie Earl cf Lathom, Conservative, in

uiuU now be safely said the end of the
war was in sight. The volunteers had
made their mark and ; the colonies had
shown they were united to the mother
land, never to be separated.
Baron Monk Brrtton, Liberal Unionist,
f-r-eonded the address in the same strain.
Lord KixnberiejrJ the Liberal leader in
Um House of Lords, in the course of his
jcraark? animadverted strongly upon the
gudden dissolution of Parliament. He ob
jected to the brevity and abruptness In
the Queen's speech, and demanded a defi-
Dita pronouncement of the Government's
policy in view of the novel and dangerous
character of the recrudescence of hostili
ty s in South Africa and explanations of
the alleged cruelties to the Boei4$, the
burning of farms and similar severities.
He concurred in the annexation of the
rÂ»r>ub!ics, but trusted the Government
pi ssessed a definite policy for speedily
concluding the war. His Lordship was
friatified at the Anclo-Gcrman. agreement,
but he said an attempt to capture the
Krrjperor arj Empress Dowager of China
would be an alarming undertaking.
Lord Salisbury Talks,
Lord Salisbury, after paying tribute to
the skill of Lord Roberts and General
Kitchener and to the bravery of the ofS-
oen and soldiers, said he approved of fall
elections on the ground that the people
objected to traveling to the polls in win
try weather, while in summer legislators

duties.
In regard to South Af ; -ica, the Premier

the Trans vaalers, the Free Staters and
the world understood there could be no
deviation from the policy of the Govern
ment already outlined. Anything re
sembling independence never could be
granted. The war must proceed to the
inevitable issue. They must let it be felt
that no one. by the issue of an insolent
and audacious ultimatum, could force the
British Government to humble Itself and
abandon Its rights. He could never al
low that a shred of independence could be

the Trans vaalers would have anything
like Belf-governing powers depended on
themselves. It might be years and It

leaped to hi* feet. A thrill went through
the house. "It Is not so," he declared,
and proceeded to deny the allegation that
he had said that any seat lost to the Gov
ernment during the recent election was
one sold to the Boers.
It was nearly 11 o'clock before he rose
to reply to the avalanche of attack
launched against him. How a strain
he had undergone was evident in the
scarcely suppressed excitement of tone on
the part of one rarely known to show
feeling In the house. He denied that he
had ever accused Mr. Ellis of being a
traitor. He denied also that he had de
cried any accusations against his own
personal integrity. "* He declared that the
special purpose of the meeting of Parlia

Commons Discusses Boer War.
It was to a crowded house that the
Speaker rose this afternoon to submit the
sessional orders, the reading of which, as
usual, was interrupted by the motion of
James Lowther to eliminate the order
prohibiting peers from interfering in elec
tions. Lowther especially referred to
Lord Rosebery as a delinquent during the
recent election. The motion met its cus
tomary fate. It was buried by a vote of
26 to 6S.
After Balfour, the Government leader,
had given notice of the intention of the
Government to absorb the whole time of
the session, the Speaker read the Queen's
speech and J. E. Gordon, Conservative,
in a naval uniform, moved the address in
reply. In doing so he made a lengthy de
fense of the war.
J. F. Hope, Conservative, seconded the
address. <â¢ - - Â¦Â¦-
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the
Liberal leader, after allusions to the elec- ':
tions, said the remarkable thing about
the war was that the public knew so lit
tle about it, and the harsh measures be
ing taken against the people of South
Africa, such as farm burning. He asked
the Government for information as to the
intention of these proceedings. He was
slow to believe that driving a stubborn
enemy to despair was the best way to
make him surrender. It was in a de
sire to end the war, but it was also In a
desire to lead to promises of harmony
and contentment that he invited the
Government to declare its policy. He in
quired why it should not be announced
to the Boers that if they laid down their
arms they would be allowed to return to
their homes.

Slander.
PITTSBURG. Dec. 6.â A nonsuit was
granted by Judge Wilson of Beaver Coun
ty to-day In the case of Thomas Robin
son, ex-State Printer, against Hon. John
Wanamaker. The suit was for $25,000
damages for slander.
During the year of 1898 Mr. Wanamaker
is alleged to have made charges that Rob
inson conspired with others to defraud the
State. In the motion for a nonsuit the
defense claimed that the general declara
tion ascribed to the defendant In the
statement of the plaintiff had not been
proved and that the innuendoes had been
left unsupported by any testimony. The
plaintiff contended that the defense must
produce proof that the statements made
by Mr. Wanamaker were privileged. The

NEW-YORK, Dec. 6.â In the private car
of Eugene Zimmerman, the Duke and
Duchess of Manchester started for. Cin
cinnati to-night over the Erie Railroad.
The car was attached to the fast express,
that started from Jersey City at 7:25
o'clock.
The Duke and his bride spent the great
er part of this afternoon making farewell
visits to their friends. Incidentally his
Grace bought a steam automobile, which
he took with him.' He took a whirl up
Fifth avenue in the machine just to see
how it worked. The automobile Is a sur
rey and is said to, have cost 51400.
His Grace was "out" to all callers at
the Holland House. Two men who called
at the hotel at 6:30 o'clock were not con
vinced that he was not In his rooms, and
they attempted to reach his apartme/its.
For a few minutes it looked as though
there would be a light with detectives and
hotel employes, but the latter retreated
before the angry visitors. Matters were
finally adjusted and the men retired to the
main corridor. By this time the Duke and
Duchess, with Mr. Zimmerman and Miss
Evans and Melville Ellis, had been hur
ried into carriages and had driven away.
TAYLOR FINALLY SUCCUMBS.
Johnson's Slayer TJnable to Tell the
Story of the Tragedy.
SAN DIEGO, Dec. 6.â R. Taylor, who
shot Tom Johnson on election night In the
rear of the house occupied by the former,
and then put a bullet through his own
head, died this afternoon at the County
Hospital in Mission Valley, never having
recovered the use of his tongue sufficiently
to enable him to tell the story of the
double tragedy.
Johnson was found on his front porch in
a dying condition, and he barely had
strength to say that Taylor shot him.
For a time it was thought that Taylor
had left the vicinity, but an hour or more
afterward he was found In a - bathtub,
where he had ; crawled and covered him
self up. with a blanket before putting his
pistol in his mouth and attempting to blow
the top of his head off. He was not dead,
though the bullet and the discharge of the
pistol had almost' blown his tongue out as
it passed back through the neck. Though
everything possible was done for him he
did not improve and was never able to tell
his story. During. the last portion of his
Illness he was unconscious all of the time.
ANTI-SALOON LEAGUE.

SAN DIEGO, Dec. 6.â The convention of
the Anti-Saloon League was held to-day,
Â¦with delegates present from nearly all of
the churches in easy , reach of . the city.
This morning a committee from the league
appeared before the. Board of Supervisors
and asked that a prohibitory ordinance be
passed 'to close the saloons of the county
outside of the, incorporated cities- and
towns. Such an ordinance was before the
people at 1 the last election and was voted
down, though a majority outside of the in
corporated cities and towns favored tho
closing of the -saloons. " "
The county board took no action, but inti
mated a willingness to pass a local option
ordinance, so; that applicants for a saloon
license could not get a license without the
consent of a majority of the freeholders
in the precinct in which the saloon is to be
located.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 6.-The Senate
v.a? in executive session for more that:
four hours to-day, the entire time being
devored to the discussion by Morgan of
the Hay-Pauncefote treaty for the abro
gation of the portion of the Clayton-Bul
wer treaty which relates to the Nicara
guan canal.
The Senator made it very plain in the
course of his remarks that while he was
not opposed to the pending treaty In al
most any form his principal, if not his
only concern. In that "connection was for
the passage of the canal bill, and he al
lowod it to be very broadly understood
that ho had engaged :n the treaty dis
cussion because oÂ£ his conviction that
there were a majarity of Senators who
would insist upon action on the treaty
as a. condition precedent to the passage
of the canal bill. For this reason, he
paid, he was willing to discuss the treaty.
He intimated privately to other Senators,
however, that he would not consent to
the fixing of a time for a vote upon the
treaty until there aÂ»so could be a time
fixed for like action upon the Nicaraguan
canal bill.
In the course of his -speech he said that
he did not in reality consider that the
treaty need have any especial bearing
upon the bill and that he believed that it
was competent for the United States to
proceed with the building of the canal re
gardless of the treaty or Great Britain's
wishes in the matter, but to satisfy other
Senators and also to meet the wishes of
the Secretary of State, for whom he in
cidentally expressed the highest esteem,
he would consent to action upon the
treaty and do all he could for it. He
would vote for the agreement whether it
Khould be amended or not, although he
would prefer that there should be no
amendment.
Discussing the question of the fortifi
cation of the canal, Morgan arTrued stren
uously against it* both as inexpedient and
unnecessary. He contended that Great
Britain was not the only power whose In
terests would be affected by a provision
for fortification, and said that Nicaragua
and Costa. Rica had a right to be con
sidered in that connection. Furthermore,
In case of war everybody knew that the
canal would be protected to the fullest
extent, so that any provision whatever
bearing upon this point was needless. He
admitted, however, that he had no doubt
that if the United States should proceed
with the construction of the canal with-*
out first taking steps to secure its neu
trality Great Britain would be grievously
offend^d and that he thought it not im
possible that the offense would be consid
errd sufficiently grave to lead to hostili
ties between the two countries.
"Do :>-ou mean," asked Senator Bever-
Idge. "that notwithstanding the present
friendly relations between the two coun
tries, England might declare war if we
Fhould construct the canal with our own
means and In our own way?"
Senator Morgan replied that he consid
ered that result among the probabilities.
"But." he continued, "I should not be
deterred by that circumstance." *
W-hat England would do, he said, was,
of course, a mere matter of speculation,
and he added that he had only referred
to this possibility in order to emphasize
his opinion that the canal should be con
structed in any contingency. The Amer
lean people, he said, had mapped out that
canal, and they were not going to allow
any obstacle, no matter how serious to
stand In the way. He believed that the
administration that would undertake to
bu'ld the canal, knowing that do so meant
war. would be indorsed by the people at
la E? e ._ Â£, majority than that
which McKlnley had received over Bryan
in tho last election.
Senator Morgan was plied with many
questions by Senators Mason. Beveridce
Tillman and others. Mason asked whether
it was true that if the Hay-Pauncefote
negotiation prevented the use of the
canal by Great Britain in time of war the
converse proposition that it also prohib
ited such use by the United States was
not also true.
To thin Morgan did not make direct re
ply, saying that he would take up that
point later in his discussion. In discuss
ing the points of the treaty with Senator
fiVlIer the Alabama Senator expressed the
view that the Clayton-Bulwer treaty is
unconstitutional and that for this reason
If for no other, it should be disregarded '

"WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.â The Ways
end Means Committee met in- special ses
sion at 10 this morning to consider
the bill reducing the war revenue .taxes
by about MO.000,000, framed by tho Re
publican" members of the committee and
introduced by Chairman Payne. There
were but two absentees, Babcock (R.)
and Robinson (D.). When the beer sec
tion was reached, fixing the rebate at 20
per cent instead of "Vt per cent, which
makes the rate %l CO per barrel, Represen
tative Richardson, ranking member of
the minority, moved a* further reduction
of all the increase made by the revenue
act. The effect of this motion, if car
ried, would have been to make the rate
$1 per barrel. The motion was defeated
by a party vote.
The consideration by section proceeded,
the bill being preserved as framed by the
Republicans.
When the meeting closed at 12 o'clock
Payne, with the concurrence of Rlchard-
Fpn, authorised ' the proceedings to-be
given out In 'detail. .
Richardson's motion on the beer tax
was the first test of strength. It pro
vided for a flat rate of $1 per barrel In
stead of $2. This was lost, 6 to 9, on a
strict party vote. Swason of Virginia
tnen moved to recommit the bill to a sub
committee with instructions to prepare a
measure making a J60.000.000 reduction.
Lost by the same vote.
Swason next unsuccessfully moved to
eliminate all special taxes on tobacco
dealers imposed by the war revenue ac;.
Underwood of Alabama presented a
substitute bill repealing the entire war
revenue act, providing for a 3 per cent
tax on incomes over $2000 and re-enacting
the present inheritance tax. On the vota
two Democrats â McClellan of New York
and Newlands of Nevadaâ did not vote,
the resuit being the defeat of the subst 1 
tute, 4 to 9.
Underwood moved to restore the tax on
telephone messages, and Xewlands of
fered an amendment restoring It on tele
graph messages, but requiring the com
panies to pay the tax. Both proposals
were lost, b to 9.
Cooper of Texas offered an amendment
striking out the exemption of religious
and charitable Institutions in the tax on
Inheritances. This was lost on a viva
voce vote.
On motion of Hopkins of Illinois the
final section Was changed, making the act
take effect immediately on Us passage.
On Dalzell's final motion to report the
bill to the House the Democrats did not
vote, and the report to the House was or
dered. Payne stated that the majority
report would be presented by Saturday.
The proceedings were marked by good
feeling, and Richardson stated that the
minority would not interpose factious op

WASHINGTON. Dec. 6.â The House- to
day, at the end of a long session, passed
the array reorganization bill by a vote of

sylvania and Underbill and Slayton of
New York, voted" with the Republicans
for the bill, and McCall (R.) of Massa
chusetts with the Democrats against It.
Otherwise It was a strict party vote.
The proposition which some of the Dem
ocrats attempted to commit their side to
in caucus, an extension of the present
temporary army until July 1, 1303. which
was voted upon indirectly on a motion to
recommit, commanded the votes of only
about half the oposltion and two Republi
cans, McCall and Mann of Illinois. Many
of the Democrats, however, voted against
the motion, because they were opposed
not only to the reorganization bill, but
also to continuing the temporary army at
its present strength.
Quite a number of: amendments were
placed upon the bill before It was passed.
The liveliest fight was mado upon a sub

Afrikander Con

Â«
, WORCESTER, Cape Colony. Dec. 6.â
About COW Dutchmen assembled in the
open air at thr> Gum Tree plantation, on
' the edge of the town, to take part in th'e
i Afrikander Congress. Horsemen from a
: radius of sixty miles had been riding in
all night.
S. C. Cronwright-Sehreiner made a
speech. In which he attacked Sir Alfred
Milner. the British High Commissioner
and Governor of Cape Colony, saying that
there would be no peace while he was
Governor.
J. W. Sauer. the former Commissioner
of P.ublic -Works, Is expected to speak and
guide the Congress conclusions, among
which will be to select a large deputation
to visit Sir Alfred Milner and urge him to
advise a cessation of hostilities and give
autonomy to the republics.
More troops have af rived here. Some
1500 Canadians and Australians are en
camped around the town and ten guns
are in position.
Worcester, where the Afrikander Con
gress is meeting, is the capital of the dis
trict of the same name in Cape Colony
and has a population of nearly 6000 people.
In spite of the English name which the
town bears, these are largely of Dutch
extraction and language and at heart ot
Boer sympathies. The town lies in the
"upper valley of the Breede River, in a
fertile, well. watered and thickly settled
district. As the crow flics it is only sixty
miles east northeast of Cape Town, but
distant 109 miles from the latter place by
rail. â¢ :
It lies on the main line of the "Western
Railroad running from Cape ' Town to
Kimberly and the north, which connects
at De Aar Junction with the lines lead- :
Ing into Orange Free State and to the,
eastern and southeastern districts of Cape
Colony. - Â¦'. Â¦ â¢ Â¦ ' i
While Worcester Is only accessible to
delegates from these districts by a long
and tedious ride by rail of over 450 miles, it
is at the same time far removed from the
late scenes of battle and armed occupancy
by the Boers, and presumably was se
lected a fit place for a free and fair ex
pression of opinions. Representatives
from all the districts in the Colony were
expected to be in attendance at the Con
gress. - V
KRUGER VISITS HOLLAND.
Transvaal President Beceives a Royal
Welcome at The Hague. -
THE HAGUE, Dec. 6.â At the opening
of the Second Chamber to-day the Presi
dent, J. Glelchman, said:
"President Kruger arrives herÂ© to-day.
He will take _ up his residence here. I
take the occasion to propose that the
Chamber authorize me to welcome In its
name the President to our country and
to offer him an expression of our cordial
sympathy." . - . , . Â¦
The proposal was adopted amid cheers
and bravos. . ' '
Mr. Kruger arrived here to-day and
was greeted at the station by the Burgo
master and Counselors. A choir of bOO
men and girls chanted Psalm 72. verses
6, 7 and 11. - -
The President and his suite then re
paired to the royal waiting-room, where
the Burgomaster warmly welcomed them
in a brief speech. Then followed Del
Spink. president of the local South Afri
can Association, in a long welcoming ad
dress, assuring Mr. Kruger of the deep
sympathy of the entire Dutch nation,
"who ha*d," he said, "so greatly, though
vainly, hoped that the great powers who
recently assembled at the Peace Confer
ence would not have permitted that in
South Africa the light of nations, the
right of. war and civil law should be
trampled under foot, or a little nation be
sacrificed in an unequal combat in de
fense of its existence."
The address, after a long eulogy of the
heroism of the Boers, proceeded to liken
Mr. Kruger to William the Silent, who
sacrificed everything for the welfare of
his people, and concluded:
"May your reliance on the Almighty,
similar to that of the Prince of Orange,
support you, Mr. President, In the ardu
ous fight for right and liberty and may
the liberty of vour nation crown your
courage. "Then will Great Britain have
learned the lesson of how dangerous It
is to attempt to throttle the independence
of a free nation."
Mr. Kruger, his suite and the reception
committee proceeded in open carriages
to the Hotel deslndis, which was re
splendent with Hags and bunting. There
a bevy of ladies, headed by the Baroness
Van Harinxam, greeted the Boet- states
man and a choir sang a hymn. Mr.
Kruger then mounted the staircase, pre
ceded by three girls strewing blossoms.
On his arrival in the reception-room the
Baroness presented Mr. Kruger with a
bouriuet.
The First Chamber has authorized its
President to welcome Mr. Kruger in be
half of the House as proof of its sym
pathy.
Mr. Kruger met with wonderful recep
tions everywhere. He reached the fron
tier at Zevenaar. Immense crowds gath
ered at all the stations, which were deco
rated with flags, the Burgomasters mado
speeches and the school children sang.
Mr. Kruger made many replies, in most
of which he represented the. Transvaal as
a little child whom a bad man wishes to
kill. In one case he illustrated his point
by drawing attention to a fair-haired
girl In the audience.^,
"If that child was outraged," he said,
"everybody would run. to her rescue, but
in my country children \ are bein? out
raged by an enemy ten times stronger
than the Transvaal."

VANCOUVER. B. C. Dec. 6.-A strange
story of sin followed by a quick and
tragic retribution for a great wrong has
been brought to light by the sudden death
here of William Boulton, alias William
T. Wilson, scion of a well-known English
family. ' The man went under an assumed'
name to escape identity, and when his
lifeless body was found there was at first
no one to identify him except a woman
who claimed to be his wife. But to-day
witnesses swore positively that the dead
man's name was William Boulton, who
eloped from England with the woman who
now claims to have been his wife. Boul
ton deserted a happy family and when
he came to Vancouver with another
woman he supposed himself safe from
But retribution found Boulton, if not
his companion, and ln a manner sudden
and terrible. Without a word of warn
ing Mrs. Boulton abruptly appeared on
the scene and confronted her guilty hus
band. What passed between them in that
last interview will never be known, unless
Mrs. Boulton chooses to tell, for a few
moments later Boulton sank to the ground
a corpse. The autopsy surgeon declared
after a close examination of the body and
its -organs that death had resulted from
fright and from no other cause
? v A ?Â°.V hei L drama , tlc . feature of tn e case is
that the husband of the woman who was
known here as Mrs. Wilson accompanied

Clansman of Victoria and the Mattewan,
bound for San Francisco with coal from
Tacdraa, were in collision oft Point No
Point on Tuesday night at 10:30 o'clock.
The Mattewan was able to proceed on her
voyage, but the Clansman was so badly
damaged that it was necessary to tow
her to Seattle for repairs. Captain Wil
liam McKenzle of the Clansman holds the
captain of the Mattewa.n to be in fault as
to his course.
"He was hugging the shore," said Mc-
Kenzle. "when with a big vessel like that
he should have been out in the channel.
"It was a clear night and both vessels
had their lights burning properly. The
Mattewan was heavily laden, and I Judge

FATAL SHOOTING
AT STONES LANDING
LOXDON, Dec. 6. â A Rome special says:
The Messageror says Dr. Mazzoni per
formed a slight- operation yesterday for a
tumor underneath .the Pontiff's arm. The
Messageror asstrts that the health of the
Pope has not been altogether satislactory
for some time past, and he has occasion
ally suffered In the part wrrcre he was
operated upon In 1S98, which- caused his
physicians to perform a slight operation
yesterday. It removed the pain.
The Pope wis merely recommended to
rest for a few days, according to the
paper rnentlor.ed. On the other hand, a
semi-official statement says the Pope's
health is perfect and that he continues his
numerous receptions without fatigue.
The only incident, according to the semi
official statement, was that the Pope a
month ago while examining a heavy ob
ject dropped it on his left toe. 'He said
nothing until this week, when he told his
physicians that he felt a pain in walking,
and Drs. Lapponi and Mazzoni dressed the
bruise. The Pope" to-day is quite well,
and It is incorrect to say that the opera
tion of 1S98 Is giving, him trouble, as only
a healthy scar remains.
France's Amnesty Bill.
A Paris special says: In the Chamber
of Deputies the debate on the Govern
ment's amnesty bill as amended by the
Senate crowded the house this afternoon.
M. Drumont, anti-Semite, representing one
of the Algiers districts, demanded that the
measure be applied generally, and notably
to MM. Deroulede, Guerln and Marcel-
Habert.
M. Lascles, anti-Semite, representing an
Algiers division, said the Government's
sole aim was to stop certain inconvenient
trials. He reproached It for excluding
political prisoners from. the amnesty.
M. Guleysse, Radical Republican, repre
senting a dtvlslon of Lorlent. said the af
fair which dominated all the others was
the Dreyfus case. Amnesty would deprive
Dreyfus of the means of proving his in
nocence, and if Ruilty he ought not to be
pardoned. Continuing, he declared amid
noisy Interruptions that amnesty would
shelter a rascal like Esterhazy and leave
under suspicion estimable others, such as
To Buy Works of Art."
A special from Paris says: It has been
learned that the French Government has '
given John B. Cauldwell. director of arts
at the Paris Exposition, who sailed on
the Deutschland last Friday, a commis
sion to sound certain American artists
resident In the United States upon the
subject of the Hale of some of their works.
The French Minister of Fine Arts has ex
pressed the desire of the- Government to
secure examples of the art of American
painters living in the United States for
the national gallery at the Luxembourg
palace. This is one of the results of the
excellent showing made by American
artists at the Paris Exposition.
Condition of the Czar.

. about that Bad Boy grown up.
Of course you remember the

which made the greatest hit

has ever been made. Well, the
boy is just as funny now as he
was then, and ; Mr. . Peck has

The weather has been urging you to buy a new overcoat,
the season has been suggesting it and now our sale is tempt-
ing you. So you can't put it off any longer. Better buy now
and your comfort will begin with your purchase.
About two months ago, while going over our overcoats,
we saw that we had far too many top coats. There was a
whole line of them at $10.00, so to reduce the stock we
reduced the price to
$7.50
Remember that the top coat is fashionable for everyday wear, and that
ours are union made, good in quality, style and fit, and are to be had at a price
that is an absolute saving. Three shades to choose from: tan, brown and olive.
For men who are in need of suits rather than overcoats we have some
fancy cheviots at the same price â $7.^0 â that will wear well and fulty demon-
strate that they are worth the price.
Every suit is union made, and we will agree to keep it in repair anytime
you bring it in. We needn't sny more than this about the suits.

Track Notes.
Favorite players aeain encountered I
squally weather at Oakland yesterday.
Bab. Anjnu. Vulcain, St. Cuthbert and i
Opponent, all first choices in the bettingri
went by the board, and the majority of J
books gathered some ooin. The track j
was very fast, and nowadays the fact
of a horse stepping six furlongs in 1:12H
excites little or DO comment.
The racing had a clean and healthy
took, and was viewed by A large crowd.
Castake, a very sort of a cus
tomer, captured the doping event at odds
of 20 to 1.
XVMi an 1800 purse as the inducement
the Shasta Water handicap attracted a
field of but four to the post. The most j
fancied of the quartet wa? Vulcain, with
110 in the saddlo. which closed at 4 to 5.
Only a few days before Diderot haj
jeefed off a mile in 1:4<>. :ind the two yea
old showed he was capable of repeating
the trick. Jack .Vartin at once took him
away in front, and, holding Malay pafe,
completed the journey, ridden out, lit |

the favorite, and when shaken up at th._-

It waÂ«= very evident from the betting on

ity course for two year olds, that Seide
footed his stable connections. From 4 the
price went to 6, and nothing ever headed
the Hildreth entry, though Articulate
rut up a strong argument throughout,
finally losing by half a length only.

too cay on his initial appearance.

"After having examined witnesses. whrÂ»
include the habitual backers of American
jockeys, their bank accounts, and betting
books, which they desired- tp Inspect, and
which were freely placed at the stewards
disposal, the stewards further declare
there is no reason to suppose Reiff bet or
received unauthorized presents. 'â¢-'.Â¦'
â¢The stewards further decided that mÂ»
blame attached to the owner or the

of vague rumors inquired into were
proved to be unfounded.
"The Liverpool stewards are commend

The decision of the Jockey Club was al

clubs this evening. The adverse * decision
in the case of Tod Sloan came aÂ» a total
surprise to the raclns world, as It old to
his closest followers. v-:i'
NEW YORK, Dec. $.â "Tod" Sldan wa*
just Rettlnj? ready to leave for Cb-Icapro
this evening, when h<* was asked for his
views on the action of the English Jockey
Club stewards.
"I don't know what to say aboit it."
said he. "but the report seems to bÂ« true,
because It la cabled here and takenifrotn
the Racing Calendar. I have received nÂ»>
notice yet. and I do not suppose [-Will. I
do not think for a minute that I have'been
ruled off. for I have done nothing serious

have ridden to the end of the season! but
I decided to stop for a year at the tiiose
of the last Newmarket meeting, beriup'*
those that followed were all small affllrs.
"This action will not alter my plan* at
all. except that I shall return to England
earlier than I intended 'i'.inc and shall re
quest the stewards to give me a healing.
I can then prove that I have not been pet
tin?, but that I considered an owner had
a right to make me a present for wtnalrÂ»*
If he eo dealred. especially when I Vaa
regularly riding for him.
"Before I got up to ride Cudamanibi

Nonsuch, the Prince of Wales* mare. In
Cambridgeshire before the same offer wss

I did not receive a present.

she fired at him. Fortunately for him
her aim was unsteady and he escaped in
jury. Soon after this occurrence, while
suffering from an over Indulgence in baJ
whisky she took out her revolver and
shot several holes in a "painting" which
adorned the wall of her saloon.
Prior to meeting Duff the would-be mur
deress was the companion of "Billy"
Ellas, who is also well known in Barbary
Coast circles. Ellas shot and killed a man
in a row over the woman, but was ac
quitted of the murder in the Supe
rior Court. He visited her In the City
Prison last night and promised to do all
in his power to save her from being sent
to the penitentiary for her crime.
"Cowboy Mag" gained considerable
notoriety some time :tgo by refusing to
allow colored soldiers to enter her saloon.
When the various colored regiments were
here waiting to be sent to Manila she
constantly stood In tha entrance to her
saloon, threatening to blow the head off
the first colored man who tried to enter.
To the police "Mag" was known as a
fearless woman, whose only ambition was
to be known as a "game fighter."
Derlant and sullen she sits in her ce'l

Late last night Duff was in a dying con

express no hope for his recovery.
NEW BOEB. BEPUBLIC.
After Kruger Gives Up.
England Will Make a Concession
BERLIN. Dec. 6â The London corre
spondent of the Leipsiger Tageblatt has
received from a highly placed personage
in England the following communication:
"If the Boers should now surrender
England will permit them to create a new
Boer republic in the northern half of the
Transvaal. It is in order to keep the pos
sibility of this open that England has not
yet officially announced to the powers the
annexation of the Transvaal.
"One of the first conditions, however, is
that the announcement of surrender must
come from Kruger. There is everv pros
pect thkt he will soon be inclined "to this
course. His visit to France -has taught
him that any number of empty assurances
of sympathy will not result in the slight
est practical help. Germany will make a
farther contribution to the education of
Mr. Krucer. and it will be to her alone
that the Boors will owe thanks if England
makes them concessions."
This somewhat romantic statement ac
quires soih" importance by the fact that
The semi-ofllclai Popt reproduces It and
adds that it dors not sound improbable,
and that England has every interest to
orett a strong bulwark against the war
like tribes of Central Africa in order to
assure the possession of the territory they
have juFt acquired.

Special Dispatch to The CalL
COLUMBUS, O., Dec. 6.â This was the
most dramatic day in the Sells divorce
trial since Peter Sells told the story oi
his life. His daughter, Florence, a beauti
ful young woman and a favorite in Co
lumbus society, told the story of her
mother's shame. She had known the bit
ter truth for years. In her childhood she
had been sent early to bed on the nights
that Xed Raymour or Harry Lyons
called, but she "was so little." She had
been unwilling to take the witness stand
In the case until forced to do so in vindi
cation of her own good name, but when
she did to-day she told the whole story.
The first questions put to Miss Sells were
on her early life. She said she knew Bert
Johnson, the express agent. "He called
upon my mother," she said. "I was al
ways sent to bed early." She knew Ne-:1
Raymour, who had caiied on her mother
In Clayton, 111., and ;n Logan. Ohio. He
had stayed In Clayton for several days
Raymour's calls were usually made when
her father was not at home. She said
she had seen Raymour kiss her mother
while they were in the home of her grand
parents in Clayton. Her mother woul.l
get letters from Raymour and would then
tell her that her "Uncie Ned" was com
ing.
Florence said Raymour had written let
ters to her. Florence remembered a muff
Raymour had given her mother Her
father paid Raymour J25 for it, but Rav
mour gave the money back to her moth
er. Florence said she had often seen
Harry Lyons in her mother's room. He
would come to the rooms by a rear stair
way. She had never seen Lyons in her
mother s bedr,oom when her father was
home. She had often seen her mother kis3
Lyons, sit on his lap and embrace him i
She told of an opal scarfpln, canes
nightshirts, neckties and Cither presents
her mother had given Lyons. When they
were in San Francisco Lyons spent sev
eral days with them. He spent much of
the time with Mrs. Sells, and they often
went driving.
Florence .said Lyons frequently visited
her mother in Logan, and at night they
occupied adjoining rooms with a connect
ing door. Lyons would go to Logan on
Saturday and remain until Monday
When they lived at tHe Park Hotel she
used to carry letters from her mother to
Lyons and would carry his answers back
Florence said she had often seen William
Bott at their home. He called on her
mother. The catch to the side would be
left unfastened and Bott would come in
and go up to her mothers room. He
would slip in the house softly. Mrs Sells
would often watch for Botts from the
room of her daughter. Bott would be in
her mother's room three and four times
a week. .

PORTO RICANS
FOR PLANTATIONS
Two Hundred Natives on the
Way to the Hawaiian
Islands.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
EL PASO, Tex.. Dec. 6.â Two hundred
Porto Rlcans, direct from their native
land, reached here to-day on their way
to the Hawaiian Islands. They are to
work on the Spreckels sugar plantation
there. Members of the party say they are
being taken to Hawaii against their will.
The train in which were two cars crowded
with Porto Rlcans was delayed here a
few hours, and during that time the na
tives were closely guarded by several la
bor agents. A reporter conversed - In
Spanish with several of the more intelli
gent men among the natives, and was
told that the islanders were Induced to
board a ship to gall around to the oppo
site side of their island, where they were
to be given work. The ship went to New
Orleans, and they said they were forced
aboard two cars that were in waiting.
Several Americana were in charge of the
party and were on guard night and day.
After the train left New Orleans it was
found that to go straight through would
put the party in San Francisco several
days before the ship for Honolulu sailed.
To avoid delay in that city and to cut off
the possibility of any of the men escap
ing it is asserted the guards had the two
cars sidetracked at Sanderson, Tex., on
the desert, for forty-eight hours. The
Porto Ricans did not know the nature of
the surrounding country, but several of
them escaped. They say the guards noti
fied the Sheriff, and a. posse rounded-up
the fugitives and brought them back to
the cars.
One of the Americans In charge of the
emigrants eaid he was under contract to
land several thousand more of Porto
Ricans in the Hawaiian Islands to be
worked on the plantations.
John D. Spreckels was seen at a late
hour last night and shown the foregoing
dispatch. Speaking for Claus Spreckeis
and himself he denied that any Porto
Ricans or other contract laborers were
being sent to the plantations in Hawaii
in which they are interested. He said
that they were importing no help at all,
but he did understand that other planta
tions had agents out getting natives from
Porto Rico. Mr. Spreckels was positive In
his statement that as far as the Spreckels
were concerned there was no foundation
for the charge made in the dispatch.

Man Who Was Shot in the Fight
With Rev. John Wohl Much
Improved.
WILLIAMSON. W. Va., Dec. 6.â S. D.
Stokes, who was shot by Rev. John H.
Wohl yesterday, is to-night improving
and it Is now expected that he will re
cover. His coat has three bullet holes in
it, which shows that Mr. Wohl fired at
least four shots. Wohl, who was killed
by Stokes, was shot twice in the shoulder
and back. Mrs. Leonle, Wohl's house
keeper, made affidavit to-night, in which
she, the only eye-witness to the fight,
swears that the first shot was fired by
Mr. Wohl after a prolonged discussion
of the sermon on dancing and the car
toons and caricatures that had been used
to emphasize its more striking passages.
Mr. WohJ, in his sermon, depicted In
vivid language the terrible results of the
dance and drink, and condemned with
out exception every man and every
woman, married or single, who indulged
in either. .

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
\V.. WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.â Wu Ting
Fang, the Chinese Minister, said to The
Call correspondent to-day:
"It is naturally very gratifying to me
that the powers have at last decided upon
the terms they will impose upon China.
The terms are very severe as they stand,
but I am glad that the United States
Government succeeded in inducing some
of the other powers to modify the harsh
demands which they were at first in
clined to insist upon and which were im
possible of acceptance by China. It af
fords me pleasure to testify to the Judi
cious conduct of negotiations by the
United States, and the recognition finally
of all that humanity and justice demand
in the Imposition of less severe terms than
were at tirst proposed. I hope that dur
ing the negotiations in which the Chinese
envoys will participate consideration will
be given to any propositions they may
submit and an impartial decision will be
rendered. If such a course Is followed
1 do not despair of an amicable settlement
at an early date.
"In view of the adoption of the demands
and their presentaiton in a few days to
the Chinese envoys, it is to be expected
that further punitive expeditions will
cease. Such expeditions are useless, in
view of the protection Chinese officials are
extending to foreigners and their, prop
erty, and the stringent measures taken
for the suppression of the Boxers. The
dispatch, of foreign troops into the in
terior and the consequent shedding of In
nocent blood and destruction of property
can only tend to incense the people and
stir them up to resistance. China's pur
pose to comply with the demands of the
powers has repeatedly been shown. I am
satisfied' that the approval of the de
mands formulated by the Ministers in
Peking and their presentation in a few
days to the Chinese envoys will have a
good effect upon the Chinese people. De
lay in drafting the demands and the re
ports of possible partition of the empire,
in consequence of the exorbitant demands,
have naturally kept the people in a fer
ment."
Predicts a Speedy Settlement If the
Views of the Chinese
Envoys Are Duly
Considered.

VOTING MACHINES AGAIN.
REPORTS of the results obtained by the use of
balloting machines in the Presidential election
were sent out from cities where they were tried
in New York and Massachusetts immediately after
the election, but for some reason those from Rhode
Island were belated. They have now been forthcom
ing, however, and are of a nature satisfactory to those
who hope to see the machines in general use all over
the Union.
In Rhode Island seventy of the machines were used
in various cities and towns throughout the State.
The test to which they were put was a severe one, for
in addition to candidates for Presidential Electors
there were also candidates for. State and for munici
pal offices, eleven constitutional amendments and a
question of an appropriation of $700.000 . to be voted
upon. To add to the complexity of the count, the
constitution requires that ballots for State officers
must be segregated from those for municipal officers
and for Presidential Electors, as all votes for State
officers must be recounted. In spite of all these com
plications the vote was satisfactory.
Out of the total number of machines in operation
in the State there was oniy, one in which there waa
During his brief term of office Towne will have no
time to acquire influence in the Senate or to accom
plish much. He may take advantage of the office 'o
use it as a platform from which to make a last long
speech for free silver, but that will not avail him
much. In fact, he is a statesman out of a job, and as
such will be considered even while in the Senate.
He may regard the appointment as a compliment, just
as he regarded the Populist nomination for Vice
President, but the one will be about as empty of real
honor as the other. Democracy soon turned him out
of his position as a Vice Presidential candidate, and
Minnesota Republicans will almost as quickly turn
him out of the Senate. Mr. Towne should adopt
some other profession. Politics is not his forte.
The only event that could prolong Mr. Towne's
Senatorial career would be a deadlock in the Legis
lature over the election of his successor. That, how
ever, is not likely to occur, notwithstanding there are
strong rivalries among the Republican leaders in the
State. Deadlocks have become odious to the Ameri
can people. They have been so numerous of late as
to have aroused public indignation and to have
greatly strengthened the demand for a change in the
constitution so as to provide for . electing United
States Senators by direct vote of the people. In the
face of that sentiment Minnesota Republicans will be
foolish, indeed if they permit any factiopal dissensions
or personal jealousies to interfere with prompt ac
tion in electing a successor to Mr. Towne.
TOWNE'S BRIEF GLORY.
S~^ OVERNOR LIND'S appointment of Charles
f 1 A. Towne to the United States Senate to fill
â the vacancy occasioned by the death of Sena
tor Davis will be received with no surprise either in
Minnesota or in any other part of the country. The
appointment confers upon the free silver leader but
a brief glory, for the Minnesota Legislature will be
in session this winter, and then a Republican will be
chosen in his place.
One of the benefits derived from the meeting of
Congress is that it has given the people live subjects
to talk about and put an end to the discussion of the
future of Democracy -^
The cruise of the Kentucky around the dominion.";
first of the Sultan of Turkey and then of the Sultan
of Morocco may be perfectly peaceful, but it has given
the ship a chance to be true to her name by acquiring
an immediate reputation as a fiehter
It is admitted there are a great many reformers in
New York, but they are confronted by a difficulty in
finding a leader, as none of the aspirants for the posi
tion have any following; and it looks as if Crokcr
might yet have the gratification of laughing last.
ANDERSON FOR SPEAKER.
The Oakland Tribune, the San Francisco
Examiner and a number of other Califor
nia papers are daily endeavoring to make
it appear. that there is a bitter contest on
for the Speakership of the Assembly.
There may be some hidden purpose for all
this. The Tribune makes the prediction
that Hon. Alden Anderson of Sulsun, the
Speaker of. the last Assembly, will be re
elected by the unanimous vote of the Re
publican members. The Tribune is the
first paper in the State to make this clear
cut declaration, but the forces at work
will make it hold good. Walt 'until the
Republican caucus meets at Sacramento
and remember the prediction. Â¦
The re-elecilon of Mr. Anderson would
not be the triumph of any faction In the
party. He Is a close friend of Governor
Gage and would be in touch with him in
his efforts j to redeem Republican party
pledges for an honest and economical ad
ministration of State affalrB.
In the diplomatic task of presiding over
the Assembly during that bitter Senato
rial contest of 1899 and 1900, Mr. Anderson
had always Rood words to say of Colonel
Burns,-' General Barnes, Senator Bulla
and Mr. Grant. While standing pat for
what his constituents wanted, he treated

SAN LUIS OBISPO TRIBUNE.)
WE directed attention a short time ago to the
rapidity with which estimates of the amount of
reduction that could be made this winter in the
war tax increased with each new report on the sub
ject. First it was hazarded as a guess that there
might be a reduction tc the extent of $15,000,000; then
a report that tine Secretary of the Treasury wouM
recommend a reduction of $20,000,000; in his message
the President recommended a reduction of $30,000,000;
and now comes the report that Chairman Payne of
the Ways and Means Committee has introduced a
bill which it is estimated will make reductions to the
amount of $40,000,348.
The Payne bill proposes to remove almost all the
taxes to which there have been urgent objections.
Those taxes, which, while annoying to the public,
yielded a comparatively small return to the treasury,
are all to be swept away. In fact, from the summary
of the bill that has been telegraphed from Washing
ton it appears as if something like a wholesale re
vision of the war revenue act is to be made.
It is gratifying that among the amendments pro
posed is one to the clause imposing a tax on lega
cies, providing that "nothing in this section shall be
construed to apply to bequests of legacies for uses -of
a religious, literary, charitable or educational char
acter, including works of art." It is against public
interest to tax private beneficence directed to the gen
eral good, and that such a tax was imposed at all was
due solely to the hurried way in which the act was
drawn up to provide a revenue to meet the sudden
emergency of the Spanish war.
It is to be noted that Chairman Payne is quoted as
saying he expects his bill to be passed by the House
before Christmas. Should the expectation prove true,
it will be a pleasant and welcome Christmas gift to
the taxpayers. The Senate may delay the final pas
sage of the measure for some time, but that will not
diminish popular appreciation of the action of the
House.
WAR TAX REDUCTIONS.
THE oil field of California proves to be exten
sive and affluent. The oil jielded is of a qual-'
ity more useful for other purposes than illumi
nation. Its value as a fuel oil is demonstrated and it
may go far to equalize conditions in California that
heretofore have been affected by the State's lack of
coal deposits. If experiments now in progress prove
that it can be used as a smelting fuel, there will im
mediately rise a great steel producing industry here.
Iron ore exists in forty-one counties of this State.
Kiuxes are abundant and accessible, but the lack of
coal in contact with the iron deposits has made the
crt; useless. The physical problem of applying oil to
nmJting will probably be solved, and a new value will
be added to the oil, to the iron ledges and to our
domestic industries.
There are other uses for this grade of oil that need
not wait upon experiment. Its utility in sprinkling
ri.il way roadbeds to kÂ«.ep down dust and vegetation
is already demonstrated. The dirt out of which com
mon roads a:id railway roadbeds have to be con
structed in this State is of such a nature, due to the
friability and excellence Â«~>f our soils, that such uses
leave the traveler subject to the nuisance of dust
The Santa Fe is already arranging to treat its road
bed with oil as a dust layer. This is done by the
Pennsylvania Central, greatly to the comfort of its
travelers, and to the benefit also of its ties and bal
last. The growth of grass, which by holding mois
ture shortens the life of a tie, is prevented by the
occasional u<* of oil.
In Santa Clara County the oil treatment is already
in operation on the public roads, and it has proved a
perfect dust layer. The experiment should be trie i
<>r\ r:ty streets. Salt water, producing a saline dust
when used for street sprinkling, proves destructive lo
leather and varnish. This will be avoided in the use
cl crude oil. Salt also attracts moisture and keeps
the roadway damp, which in many cases is not de-
The present and- prospective uses of our earth oils
are so numerous that we hail with satisfaction the
discovery of every new source of supply. An eco
nomic material like this oil will not go begging for
applied uses in this age of invention and enterprise.

RIAL EXULTATION OF THE NEW YORK WORLD.
PENSIONS FOR FORMER SLAVES
EIIJROM several of our Eastern exchanges we learn
I there is being carried on in that section of the
Union, and notably in the South, a scheme de
vised by certain unscrupulous persons for duping
colored people. -The scheme is embodied in a so
called movement for obtaining pensions for former
slaves. The scheme was exposed at the last session
of Congress and its fraudulent nature denounced by
the Senate Committee on Pensions, but none the less
it continues to flourish, and it is said the President re
ceived many letters and petitions urging him to
recommend the plan to Congress in his recent mes
sage.
The promoters of the scheme have in the past
made it profitable by organizing associations in va
rious parts of the country to support the movement
It is stated that for each of these associations there
was a charge of $2 50 for a charter, and 10 cents a
month was collected from each member. In that way
quite a considerable revenue was obtained, and, ac
cording to the Washington correspondent of the New
York Times, it is estimated that upward of 100,000
victims have been duped.
The circulars sent out at first were of a nature so
clearly fraudulent that the postoffice authorities ex
cluded" them from the mails, but it appears the pro
moters have still some means of operating. They
maintain a show of activity at Washington and in
duce a considerable number of negroes, particularly
the more ignorant and credulous, to contribute funds.
The fraud is so attractive to many that the
dupes are numerous, and several of the more
influential papers in the East have undertaken
to put an end to it. Thus the Philadelphia
Public Ledger says that while the scheme is not
without the veneer of plausibility, "it will not de
ceive intelligent people of the North and South of
either race. The States and private benevolence and
charity must support the dependent classes. The na
tion, as such, discharged its duty when the slaves were
given the boon of freedom and when the constitution
and the Federal laws guaranteed them civil rights.
The duty of enforcing them still rests with the na
tion. It is unfortunate if this scheme for the benefit
of its conscienceless organizers cannot be reached by
the criminal law and punished as a conspiracy to cheat
and defraud."
Whether there has been any fraudulent working of
the scheme on this coast does not appear. It is, how
ever, one by which honest and worthy men might be
deceived so far as to give it aid and countenance. It
is therefore a .matter to which our people should give
some attention. From all that we can learn the ac
tivity on the subject displayed at Washington has no
other object than that of enabling a set of promoters
to live on the contributions of their dupes.

UTTERANCE
IN VARIETY
THE SCHOOL OF EXPERIENCE.
THE CALL recently said: "The decline of the
stock industry, brought about by destruction of
feed on the free range, has at last reached tha
consumers of meat in the form of a higher price for
that food." It is surprising that the Post attacks this
as an expression of "the cattle barons," and, with a
strangely strabismatic logic declares that: "It is not
true that the destruction of the feed on the free
ranges is the cause of the high price of meat to the
consumer. The advance is normal, and is the result
of the scarcity of feed on all the ranges, owing to the
season and the necessity of stall feeding."
The calm and common mind will be inclined to ad
mit that the' destruction of feed makes it scarce, and
we have the testimony of the range men themselves,
and of the agrostologists of the Agricultural Depart
ment, that use of the range in common, resulting in
overstocking, destruction of the natural forage by too
close feeding, and increase in aridity, drying up the
deep springs and watercourses, is the cause of the
rapid decline in the number of range cattle, that has
made meat scarce and high. Of course the advance in
the price of meat is "normal," if by that is meant the
relation of supply and demand, as distinguished from
an abnormal, .or artificial, rise in price, that would be
due to the cornering of the supply to hold it until the
unsatisfied demand laised the price. The Post
should seek understanding and discuss this important
issue from the standpoint of accurate information,
and not as if it were the advocate of some great cor
poration that has millions of acres of land to sell and
wants the public domain that is suited to grazing only
destroyed in order to enhance the value of its public
grant. <
The decrease of range cattle and the high price of
meat and the scarcity of forage are not things of a
season, but are the progressing results of destroying
the capacity of the free range to carry stock. We
quote again the, statistics of receipts of range cattle
in Chicago in proof that it is caused by no sudden
drought, nor by the emergency of one season. The
range cattle received in 1895 amounted to 429,300
head; in 1896, to 272.200; in 1897, to 236,300; in 1898,
to I95.I/5; in 1899, to 177,300; in 1900, to 142,600. That
is a decline of 66 per cent in six years. It means, and
can only mean, a decline of two-thirds in the feeding
capacity of the free range which fed these cattle. The
range has left only one-third the feed that it had in
1895. Let things go on as they are, which the Post
seems to want, and it need not tax its knowledge of
business arithmetic unduly to figure out the brief
time that will elapse before the free range is all de
stroyed and the "scarcitj-" of feed, which it now ad
mits to exist, will become the total disappearance of
all the range forage.
It is not true that The Call, or any stock man, has
advocated leasing "vast tracts of Government do
main to the cattle barons for long terms of years,
thus virtually establishing a monopoly in the grazirg
lands of the West that must eventually place these
acres absolutely beyond the reach of settlers," as the
Post insists. *
At the meeting of the Pacific Stockmen's Associa
tion in this, city last spring a memorial was sent to
Congress asking it to pass a "law to classify lands in
the arid and semi-arid regions, segregating such tracts
a?, are more valuable for grazing than for any other
j-urpoÂ«e. and leasing the same as grazing ranges, for
the use of actual stock-owners and the owners of
abutting agricultural lands, reserving mineral and
such other rights as will equalize benefits, induce ac
tual agricultural settlement when the same is pos
sible, and. above all. arrest the present rapid destruc
tion of the sole value of these ranges, which consists
in their natural grasses and other forage."
It was determined by the association which sent
that memorial that no law could or should pass that
did not protect the *mall stock-owner, the mineral
prospector and the agricultural settler. Yet the Post
attacks these men as rabid monopolists, cattle barons
and sinister citizens!
As to the leasing policy for grazing lands, we are
not without precedents and examples. It is probable
that in wise and reasonable treatment and solution of
physical and economic problems the Australian Gov
ernments are the foremost in the world. The English
race settled there has worked out on virgin soil the
very issue that is before us here. This has been done
without passion or prejudice, and Australia may well
be proud of the result. In an arid climate she pos
sessed vast grazing tracts that were as rapidly robbed
of their forage as ours have been. But Australia,
with keen wisdom, arrested the destruction in time,
and by a wisely regulated leasing system has restored
the stock-carrying capacity of her public domain,
piotected large and small stock-owners in their rights
thereto, and guarded also the rights of the mineral
prospector and the agricultural settler. As a result
Australia is one of the great meat supplying nations.
Our troops and crews in the Philippines have been fed
Australian meat, and her supply and export are in
creasing every year. Her people are like ours, and
as free. They are as alert in protecting their rights
against monopoly, and under their leasing system no
monopoly has appeared, except a monopoly of pros
perity to the stock-owners, large and small. To say
that we cannot well tike lessons of Australian wis
dom is to utter folly.
The law upon which our Western stock men are
reaching agreement proposes that the leasing policy
shall be optional to counties, and shall not anywhere
apply except in counties that have asked for it. This
optional system is itsdf a safeguard against monopoly.
Unless something of the kind is done, and that soon,
the drought and the desert will "monopolize the
ranges, and the rise in the price of meat will go on un
til its percentage of advance equals the percentage in
the decline of range stock, and meat will become a
luxury.
THE REAL WORLD POWER.
any hitch, and in thaj. one the' interruption did riot
exceed five minutes. A review of the votes showed
that fewer mistakes- were made by the machines than
by the voters in marking the Australian ballot; and
there was a gre'at gain of time both in voting and in
counting the. vote. It is to be noted, moreover, that
a careful recount proved the count of each machine to
have been accurate.
Commenting upon the confirmation which the
Rhode Island experiments have thus given to the re
sults obtained in other cities, the Springfield Repub
lican says: "It is practically settled, if appearances
do not mislead, that change from hand to machine
voting in the near future is inevitable. The important
thing at the present time, therefore, is a careful and
unprejudiced examination of the claims of all ma
chines in the market in order that when machines are
adopted they shall be the best adapted for the pur
pose designed. Let all have a fair chance to show
what they are capable of doing. It is only in this
way that we can get the best and the most economi
cal."
The view expressed by the Republican is undoubt
edly the right one. Machine voting has come to stay.
California should not be the last State in the Union
to adopt the system, and the subject should receive
the attention of the Legislature during -the coming
winter. A method of voting which has proven eco
nomical, accurate, speedy and labor-saving in so many
cities can no longer be regarded as a visionary
scheme.

tween Assistant United States Attorney
Edward J. Banning and Chauncey M. St.

the mercury falls forty degrees when they

Mr. St. John thinks the United States At

Government transports, because federal
Grand Juries have almost invariably ig

"I Intend to protect my men In the per

John yesterday, "and I am tired of having
these Government smugglers giving Cus
toms Inspectors the ha: ha! and braggin?
that they escape punishment in the bi?

gling If I can."
On the other hand, Mr. Banning: assert

cases that have been presented, and that

and tx-nt her into port oy two days.. The
Manx King had a hard time off Staten Isl

and everything movable on deck waa

&-r|=d HERB will be an unusual rush of
1 travel to Alaskan points next
1 spring and summer. The Pacific
)t Coast Steamship Company Is pre
paring to put six steamships on
the line and there will be others In com
petition. The bi? transport Senator Is be
ing- Rot ready for the service, while the
State 1 of California has been withdrawn
from the Columbia River trade and will
be turned into an excursion boat. The
new steamship Spokane, which Is to be a
veritable floating palace, is also nearing
completion, and she also will go on the
excursion run. Then there will be the
Cottage City. City of Topeka and Al-Ki,
besides half a dozen others.
It Is not so many years ago that one
steamship was enough to care for all the
Alaskan trade. In those days the old Cal
ifornia ran from Sound ports to Juneau
and Sltka once a month. Leter the Cali
fornia's name was changed to Eureka and
for yearn she ran on the southern route.
After the withdrawal of the California
the old Los Angeles took up the running,
and she was followed by the Idaho. The
Idaho went the way of many unlucky
ships and the Ancon took her place. The
Ancon went on a reef and never came oil
and the City of Topeka waa put on as a
bi-monthly boat.
The Topeka has been running ever since,
but to help out she has had as assistants
the Mexico. Corona, Queen and Al-Ki.
The Mexico was lost on the Alaskan coast
and the Corona came near to sharing her
fate. She went on the rocks near the
Wrangel Narrows and was only got oil
after some hard work. Since then the
rush to Alaska has increased with leaps
and bounds, and next spring will seÂ« a
dozen vessels on the route.

Nothing Just as Good
Police Officer M. J. Filbert testified to
being called into the house soon after
the crime; to the finding of the body of
Mrs. Clute in the back bedroom.; to his
notification of the police at the Seven
i teemh-street station, and of his finding
I of the coupling pin partly covered with
' blood in the front room on his second
; visit to the house after he had notlned his
. superiors of the crime.
Dr. T. J. Inman swore that he was
called to the house to attend what he
thought was a suicide. He rushed up the
' stairs and found the body of Mrs. Cluti?
i lying on the floor wiih her face covered
' with blood. With a neighbor, a marÂ»
i named Meyers, he then ran to the street
! and called Police Officer Filbert. He at
! tended the autopsy of the deceased at tlie
I Morgue and found eleven wounds on her
head. They could have caused her death,
he said, and they might have been inflict
1 ed with an instrument such as the coup
ling pin. The case was then continued till
j this morning.
Mrs. Annie Armstrong, mother of Percy,
was then called. She identified the bag
in evidence as similar to the one Hot?
used when he worked In her house, but.
she was very positive that she had never
seen Hoff use a coupling pin In connection
with his work.
Mrs. Lfgg, who had been on the stand
Wednesday, was cross-examined nearly
all of yesterday morning by Attorney
Schooler. She stood hrm on her evidence
and could not be shaken, with the excep
tion that she would not positively identi
fy Hoff as the man that came out of the
side entrance of the house after she heard
screams upstairs and van out of the front
door for assistance. She stated that tho
man that came from tne house and passed
up the street and turned Into Liberty
street carried a carpet bag, Â«...at he had
a dark, shabby suit on, and that he
looked like the defendant, but that she
was not certain that Hoff was the man.
In the former trial she was positive that
it was the defendant, but yesterday she
would not positively twear to his iden
tity. Her testimony waa accepted In the
light of a victory oy the defense. On
the rest of her evidence she stood firm-
Yesterday Armstrong's memory waa
very bad. He coyld remember nothing
about the tragedy without first reading
his evidence in the former trial. He de
luyed the proceedings fully twenty min
utes In the- morning by studying the evi
dence, and the court adjourned at the
noon hour with him still reading his
former testimony. In the afternoon his
memory wa*Â» worse and as he stepped
from the stand after being excused, Eu
gene Deuprey pointedly asked him if lie
nad been approached by or had talked
with any person representing Hoff. Ho
denied talking to any .-uch and ever hav
ing been coached by anybody.
Something of a sensp.tlon was sprung in
tUe Hoff ca^e yesterday afternoon when
Percy Armstrong was leaving the wit
ness stand. The lad is 14 ye*re old and
at the former trial positively swore that
he saw Hoff, whom ;ie knew well, pass
down Liberty street near Valencia on
December 16, 1^7; that home boys shouted
"Hello, Hoff." and that it was about 3
o'clock In the evening.

Defendant.

B. Mahoney, one of the victims of the ac

body was taken to the Oakland Morgue.
C. "VV. Steele, conductor of the. work

principal witness. He told of the pre

"Free Friday" at Hopkins Institute.
To-day, being the first Friday of the
month, the exhibition of paintings at the
Mark Hopkins Institute of Art will be
open to the general public. "Free Fri
days" at the Institute always attract a
large crowd, and the present exhibition
being of special interest it is expected a
larger number of people than usual will
be in attendance.
Professor William W. Campbell has
be'in decided upon as the successor of
the late Professor James, K. Keeler as
cUrr-ctor of Lick Observatory. The choice
was made in a committee meeting
Wednesday, and the formal election of
Professor Campbell to the position Â¦will
be made at the next regular meeting of
the board of regents of the University of
California.
The selection will give general satis
faction, as Professor Campbell's em
inence as an astronomer is unquestioned
and his executive ability is of a high or
der. He has been conducting special in
vestigations at Lick Observatory for nine
years past, and his discoveries have
helped to give the observatory its fame
and have made him known the world over
as a brilliant astronomer.
Professor Campbell is a native of Ohio,
aged 39 years. He was graduated from
tue. University of Michigan in 1885. and
was at once appointed professor of math
ematics in the Cniverslty of Colorado. In
1SSS he succeeded Professor Schaeberle as
director of the observatory of the Uni
versity of Michigan, upon Professor
Schaeberle'B being called to I,iek Observ
atory.
At Ann Arbor Professor Campbell be
came distinguished for his remarkable ob
servations of comets and computations
of comet orbltp. He wrote a book on
"Practical Astronomy." In ISM he be
came engaged In spectroscopic work at
Mount Hamilton, and in June of the fol
lowing year he was appointed astrono
mer and given charge of the spectroscopic
work.
Professor Campbell had entlr.e charge
of the Crocker eclipse expeditions. He
holds the title of doctor of science from
the University of Pennsylvania. In ad
dition to his work as an Investigator ho
has been a large contributor to the
Popular Science Monthly and the Astro
physical Journal.
Since the death of Professor Keeler Dr.
Campbell has been acting director of the
observatory, and he has been urged for
the appointment as director by many of
the most eminent astronomers of the
country. Â¦*

charter. Braunhart will direct the at
tention of the board at the next meeting
to the fact that the company has not com
menced the exercise of its franchise with
in six. months after the charter took ef
fect, and its bond of $10,000 may be claimed
by the city. Braunhart says the option
cn the company, which Reed is so anxious
the city should buy. is a will o* the wisp,
and the company has nothing to sell. The
order granting the franchise, dated "No

of its conduits should be commenced with

On cross-examination Judge Wallace
said that his testimonv of direct examina
tion was not given with the intention of
conveying the Impression that Melone had
never been of service, to him. "On the
When Wallace had concluded his state
ment regarding Melone's assertion of the
esteem in which he heid the highest trib
unal in the State, Attorney Campbell,
who represents Judge Wallace, said.
"How about Melone's statement that you j
Intended to disinherit your sons; that
they were lazy and indolent and were en
titled to nothing."
"It is without truth," responded Judgo
Wallace. "I never told him I intended to
disinherit any one."
Melone's long and sensational story re
garding the McCauley scandal was next
called to Judge Wallace's attention and
he told the story.
"The circumstances of the McCauley
case have all been widely distorted," said
Judge Wallace. "McCauley made some
malicious statements about me. but when
I forced the issue he denied them in toto
as will be shown by a letter now In
court." Judge Wallace was handed the
letter In question and read it to the jury.
In the latter McCauley said: "In moments
of anger I have spoken of you in the modt
unfriendly terms, bul I know nothing
whatever to your prejudice as a Judicial
officer, and I distinctly deny the rumor
that I ever paid or attempted to pay you
any money to influence your decision ufl
a Judge." This letter was written in this
city. June 22. 1SS2. and its admission :n
evidence largely set at rest the story of
bribery recited by Meione when he was
on the stand.
Attorney Campbell questioned Judge
Wallace as to Melone's assertion that the
expenses of the pilgrimage to Sacra
mento to secure needed legislation In the
bond case were to be borne by him at
Wallace's request.
"I didn't know there were to be any ex
traordinary expenses In the case." an
swered Judge Wallace. "Melone never
told me he was to be put to any expense,
save the railroad fare and hotel bills. He
did net present the lobbying claims now
under discussion until he filed his bill of
particulars In this action. He did not
present these claims when I asked him for
my share of his profits in the bond deal.
He simply refused to give me my share
without giving any reason."
Judge Wallace also denied Melone's as
sertion that he had negotiated the sale of
the plaintiff's Pacific Bank stock. "S. G.
Murphy, now of the First National Bank,
carried out that transaction," said Judge
Wallace. . . , .
Wallace- was called to the stand at the
opening of the morning session and had
not progressed far when the opportunity
presented Itself for him to correct the Im
pression given by Melone that he had
called down from above a curse upon the
heads of the Justices of the Supreme
Court of California. "I deny that I ever
said the Supreme Court was an infamous
body," said Judge Wallace. "I have too
much regard for the honor and integrity
of that tribunal to greet It with the con
temptuous words attributed to me by my
opponent, Melone."
Ex-Judge William T. â¢Wallace was given
an opportunity yesterday In his action
against Drury Melone to dissipate the
mist of suspicion the defendant sought to
draw close around various transactions
In which the aged Jurist had been engaged
In connection with the settlement of the
Placerville* bond cases. In his testimony
Melone at times directly asserted, and
again endeavored to convey the impres
sion by Innuendo, that Wallace owed him
dollars numbering into the thousands
for services rendered in years gone by.
Melone's claims were mixed in character
and Included bills for promoting litiga
tion, for molding the -policy and action of
Legislatures, for negotiating loans, hand
ling deals of unknown character, and
finally as a mediator in matters involving
stories of bribery' and alleged corruption.
contrary," ho said. "MelonÂ© ha* dona
many things for me. He Is a convenient
man â always in motion and ready to do
things that require considerable action.
It was often pleasant to see him enter into
the spirit of a deal. He seemed- to enjoy
the run about, but as to these things
which he has said he did for me on prom
ise of remuneration, he did not do them.
The deposition of Henry Miller, the
wealthy cattleman, was next Introduced
to show that Wallace sold his Gilroy prop
erty without theÂ» assistance of. Melcne. In
his deposition Miller testified that Frank
McCoppfn was Wallace's agent in that
transaction.
"McCoppin's servlcea were so satisfac
tory to both cf us." the witness stated in
his deposition, "that I gave him a prize
stallion worth $500 and a prize bull worth
JoOO."
"And." added Judge Wallace, "his serv
ices were so satisfactory to me that 1
wished to reward him. I did not wish to
give him money, but after a consultation
with friends I decided to give him a bar
rel of whiskyâ and It was good stuff.
too."
S. G. Murphy, the banker, was called to
the stand to corroborate Judge Wallace's
testimony that it was he who negotiated
the sale of the Pacific Bank stock for ,
Judge Wallace. Murphy testified that ha I
carried out the transaction unassisted by ]
Melone, and the first he knew that Melona
had taken credit for consummating thÂ©
deal was when ne was so informed after
the case at bar had been Instituted..
At the opening of the afternoon session
Judge Wallace was again called to the
stand. He continued his denial of the al
legations made by Melone. Judge Wal
lace gave way to Senator Porter Ashe,
who was called In rebutlal on behalf of
Judgre Wallace.
"I know all of the parties interested In
this cate." said Senator Ashe. in response
to tho questions cf counsel. "Melone came
to my desk In the Senate in February.
1S99. and said "ne -was endeavoring to se
cure the passage of legislation to facilitate
the collection of the Placerville bonds. He
askoil me if I would introduce a bill. Ha
said that he had me.de arrangements with
either Dibble or Johr.s-on to Introduce a
similar bill In* the Assembly. I told him
that it would be a great pleasure to mÂ» to
be of service 10 him, as I was aware of
Judge Wallace's connection with the case.
I had been In Judge Wallace's offlcs
studying law and knew something of the
history of the case, and furthermore my
friendship for Judge Wallace and his son
made me wish to be of service In the mat
ter. I gave Melone no other reason for
my friendship to the measure which he
wished introduced. Downey Harvey's
, name did not come up in the matter until
, three weeks later. Hawley's name was
mentioned to me, and as he was a per
sonal friend It increased my Interest in
the bond case,, but did not increase my
activity. I was doing all I could on ac
count of my friendship for the Wallaces. \
The only connection Judge Williams had }
with the case was â¢when he called at the
committee headquarters, where the bill
had been sent, and we haU a tiff- When
we left the room I stated that I had had
sufficient fun with Judge Williams to re
pay me for my trouble in connection with
the case. On cross-examination Judge
Magulre on behalf of the defendant en
deavored to wrest from Ashe a statement
to the effect that "his fun with Judge
Williams" was in an effort to even an old
score. Ashe Insisted that it wasn't, but
cn being pressed stated that if it pleased
counsel he could put it that way if he de
sired.
Ex-Judge C. W. Cross -was called to the
stand to prove that out of something over
113,000 his client. Mrs. Cutter, only re
ceived $10,203 70, Melone retaining the rest
for expenses. Cross admitted that such
was the fact, and then counsel for Judge
Wallace pointed to the fact that although
Melone had collected $5000 on account ol
expenses he was still searching for some
one who would pay them again. "And."
said Campbell, "he has centered on Jud^ra
Wallace as a. fitting person to pay them,
because Judge Wallace has sued him for a
Just debt."
Cross left the stand and an adjournment
until Monday was ordered.

of Melone's Many Sensations.
A BRASS BAND, at the head of
which marched a wicked looking
highbinder, was the forerunner
of a curious spectacle In China
town and on Market street yes
terday morning. It was a Chinese
funeral, and the remains being taken to
their resting-place were those of Lem
Yuk Lip, the leader of the notorious
Suey Sing Tong, the most famous and
wicked of Chinese" societies in this city.
For two hours the corner of 'Dupcrit
and Jackson streets was crowded with
people, who stood and listened to the
clashing of cymbals, the discordant noise
made by the beating of tomtoms and the
shrill notes of a Chinese bugle, vasfed
by the occasional sounds of a Chinese
dirge, chanted by a Mongolian clad in
garments of blue of the liveliest shade
The casket containing the remains of
the. highbinder chief stood at the en.l
of a raised platform, on which rested all
the delicacies so dear to Chinese palates.
A roasted pig, arranged in life-like man
ner, occupied the center of the platform,
flanked on either side by a porker of
large dimensions, but not cooked, and to
one side on a huge platter reposed the
uncooked remains of a goat, which when
first placed had a most dignified appear
ance, but. owing to the giving way of
one of the props, later- on attained a
truly mournful aspect.
Surrounding this array of meats were
dishes of all sorts of edibles, with the
chopsticks placed reauy for the use of the
deceased on his voyage to Join Confu

Burning punks and candles added to the
festal appearance of the entire affair.
The only evidence of mourning shown

"Wli&t time did ycu find thiit tney were
crnlng ovt-r the fence In numbers?"
"About 2:2*3 o'clock."
J. J. Ford, an architect, was called at
the request of Attorney Eisner. He tr-sti
lied to having tried to gain admission to
the glass works premfres. lie had even
Jiskofl the watchman at the Fifteenth and

roof about ten minutes before the accident.
Shortly before the roof gave way boys
i. "or.g the ventilator were jumping up and
' down and cheering the game on the foot
ball field. He fell through when the roof
caved in.
"How did you <scape?"
"I do not know. All I know is that I

Coroner's Jury Finds No Respon
sibility for Glass Works Tragedy.
NEITHER POLICE NOR
EMPLOYES TO BLAME
Its Verdict Declares That the Victims Had No
Business on the Premises.
Policeman J. O. Sullivan, who was on
duty -at a gate at Fifteenth and Folsom
streets, said that no one had come to him
for aid at the glass works.
Dr. T. B. W. Leland. autopsy surgeon,
was the last witness. He 6ave testimony
as to the cause of death In each case.
Lieutenant M. O. Anderson, who was in
charge at the football game, said that
forty men were on duty inside the
grounds, at the expense of the football
management. Eight mounted men and
several policemen, two at each gate, were
on duty on the outside. He had received
no request from the glass works people
until Officer Shore came to him. At that
time Acting Sergeant Riehl had said he
would go after some of his men to take
care of that crowd.
The officer told of going to find his ser
geant after Selling's appeal to him. The
accident occurred before the police had an
opportunity to do anything.
Policeman Rlehl testified to -meeting Of
ficer Shore in his search for orders just
before the accident.
"Some small boys whom I drove away
from looking through a cra**k of the fence
of the football fleld had said to each other
that they could get Into* the 'glass works
for 10 cents."
"Why did you ask sucn a question?"
"Not until about five minutes before the
accident." the witness replied. "Mr. Sell
ing came the-n and askeJJ me to help drive
the crowd away. I asked hiai, 'Is it not a
fact that you have been charging admis
sion?' He denied it indignantly."
"Yes: It Is," was the reply.
Policeman Charles M. Shore, a mounted
patrolman, was on duty In the vicinity of
the football prounds. At one time he saw
a crowd going into the glass works prem
ises through the Harrison-street gate.
"Did any one come to you to keep the
crowd out?" was asked.
Policeman William D. White, on duty
at the Seventeenth-street station, said
that no telephone message was received
by him from the glai*s works.
"Is the telephone service pretty bad?"
was asked of him.
Sergeant Perrjn. who was In charge at
the Seventeenth-street station, said he re
ceived no message. He raid the telephone
service wes very bad. The only message
he received was one asking for police and
ambulances after the accident.
"What did they say to him?"
"They told him to Vluck his freight. 1
He would stop the boys, but when the
blpger fellows told him to get out of the
way he would let them go up the ladder.''
Officer William Callinan. who was on
duty at the Central police station, testi
fied to having- .received a telephone mes
sage from the plass works about 2 o'clock
and again shortly before the accident. In
each case he connected the applicant with
the Seventeenth-street station.
"A crowd of tough fellows came along
and made the man get out of the wav and
lÂ«*t them up."
"Did others go up at the pame place?"
Percy E Fuller, p.n attorney, said he
was unable to ret Into the football
grounds, not having got a ticket in ad
vance. Ho went with the crowd Into the
Klas-F works' premises without seeing any
watchmen warning people away or at
tempting to stop them. He went up on
the root, and was sitting on the edge of
the ventilator when it went down, but he
wars able to hold on and so escaped fall
ing-.
Harold Palmer, a 13-year-old boy, with
his left wrist bandaged and his arm in a
ellng, told <if elimb : ng the fence from the
H.-Â»rrÂ«son-strÂ«.Â«t side. Several -boys v,-Â«re
with him. among them Willie Rothenstein,
wh3 v.as killed. A man at the foot of the
lad-ier in the mixing works stopped him
from going up. but he went around and
clambered up at another place. He fell
through, ana thinks that his escape was
due to falling on a pile cf engine rags.
"Did you see" any one pay for admis
sion?" .
"I heard a man ask the man at the foot
of the ladder, who stopped me. how much
it would cost to be allowed to go up. The
man said, 'Two steams,' and the other
gave him 10 cents and went up."
ers in the glass works, testified to seeing
the crowd swarming over the fences soon
after 2 o'clock. He and Mr. Davis started
for the police, but just as they got to the
Fifteenth and Folsom street gate the ven

Ninety Per Cent of It Really Caused
From Poor "Digestion.
Real organic heart trouble I? Incurable,
but scarcely one case In a hundred is
organic.
The action of the heart and stomach are
both controlled by the same great nerves,
The sympathetic and pneumogastric. and
â¢Ahon the stomach lails to properly digest
th<? food and St lies in the stomach fer-
menting gapes are formed which distend
the orrcan, causing pressure on the heart
and lungs, causing palpitation. Irregular-
ity and shortness of breath.
The danger from this condition is that
t!io continued disturbance of the heart
f;onrr or Hater may cause real organic
heart trouble, and In fact frequently
does so.
Furthermore, poor digestion makes the
"hicK-d th'.n and watery and deficient in red
corpuscles, and th.e further irritates and
wakens the htart.
The most sensible thing to do for heart
trouble is to insure the digestion and as-
Fimllatlon of the food.
This can be done by the regular use
after meals of some safe, pleasant and
rffoctive digestive preparation, like
Stuart's Dyppepsla Tablets, which may
be found at most drug stores and which
contain the necessary digestive elements
In a pleasant, convenient form.
Thousands of people keep well and vfg-
orous by keeping thoir digestion perfect
by observing the rule of taking one or
two of these tablets after each meal, or at
Ira5t after each hearty meal.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets contain U. S.
P. pepsin, diastase from malt and other
r.atural digestives which act only on the
food, digesting It perfectly and preventing
aridity, gases and many diseased condi-
tions which accompany a weak stomach.
When Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are
used you may know you are not taking
Into the system any strong medicine or
powerful drug, but simply the natural dl-
pfÂ«tive elements Â¦which every weak stom-
arh Jacks.
So widely known and popular have these
tablets become that they arc now sold in
the United States. Canada and Great
Britain.

the germs of a real unity and a common i
nationality. As- In the years preceding ,
our Federal convention, it was the ob
stacles to commerce arising from inter
state tariffs that proved a powerful in
centive to work for an improved constitu
tion, so in Germany, the impediments to
commercial development created in this
age of steam by the multiplicity of tar
iffs and customs regulations brought home
to monarchs as well as patriots the ad
vantage of a more complete unjon. The i
forty states of the confederation com- |
prised an area, about four times the size ;
of New York; some of them were wholly
inside" of others, and the boundaries of all
were so Irregular and Interlaced that com
modities from outside of Germany had to
encounter twelve or fifteen different tar
iffs before they could reach the center
of this group of states. The remedy was
sought In forming a commercial union by
treaties. This commercial union or zoll
verein (customs union) was started In two
groups, with Prussia as the promoter and
nucleus of one and Bavaria of the other.
The two groups were fused into one in
the course of the year 1S33. and Germany
became one for the purposes of commer
cial intercourse. This consummation con
ferred upon 26,000.000 people the benefits
of Internal free trade. The states form
ing the zollverein adopted a uniform tar
iff, abolished all custom-houses except
on the external frontiers of the union and
divided the customs receipts amonc them- |
selves on the basis of population.
Through the facilities offered by this un
ion capital was directed from foreign to
internal trade, and in a few years marked
improvements- were made in all the means
of communication. The increased circu
lation of goods and people which followed
steadily wore away the barriers of sus
picion and prejudice and contributed pow
erfully to the sentiment of union. With
us Internal free trade has cemented the
Union; in Germany It prepared a way
Soon after Its completion the union be
gan to form commercial treaties with for
eign nations, and Germany consequently
began to appear as a unit In the diplo
matic world. Sir John Bowring In a re
port to the English Parliament in 1S40
said: "The zollverein has brought the
sentiment of German nationality out of
the regions of hope and fancy Into those
of iwsitlve and material Interests." It
was 'generally regarded. In Germany as
"the first step toward what Is called the
Germanlzation of the people." â¢ _ -â¢
The momentous year of revolutionâ 1S43
âwhich brought down the political sys
tem of Metternlch with a crash, revealed
at once the strength of the sentiment for
union and Insuperable obstacles to Its at
tainment. In the United States all that
had been necessary was the assent of the
people; In Germany, not only the assent of
the people but the assent of the hered
itary rulers was Indispensable. With us
there had been general agreement as to
the theory of. government: In Germany
believers in the divine right of kings still
held the reins of authority. More than
one of these princes could echo the decla
ration of the King of Prussia to the first
united Prussian Parliament :> "No power
on earth shall ever succeed In persuading
me to exchange the natural relation be
tween king and people for a conventional,
constitutional one, and neither now nor
ever will I permit a written sheet, like a
second Providence, to thrust Itself In be
tween our God In heaven and this land to
displace the old sacred fealty." In addi
tion to this conflict between the rights of
kings and the rights of the people there
was the antagonism between Prussia and
Austria. Both could not be paramount In
a united Germany, and neither would
yield peaceably to the other. That Aus
tria was only partly German In popula
tion enhanced the perplexity of the situa
tion for hoth rhe Inclusion and theexclu
slon* of Austria- from a united Germany
seem equally- to violate the principle of
nationality. The party who. to secure the
union of all Germans, would take In Bohe
mia and Hunga*y,wcre known as the "big
Germans." and ;hose whose national feel
' Ing would leave opt the Austrian Germans
In order to avoldincludlng the Slavs ami
Magyars were called the "little Germans."
It was the existence of such antago
nisms of principles and of such conflicting
Interests that drew.forth from Bismarck
his famous .Utterance: . "It Is not by
speeches and majorities that the great
questions of the time will have to be de
cidedâthat was the- mistake made in 1S43
and 1S49â but by blood and iron."
Our first impulse 'is to regard the suc
cessful solution of the American problems
of 17S7 by discussion and majorities wiTh
complacency, and inspired by. the contrast
with the i experience of .Germany, to mor
allzo on the superior cacpacity of the
Anglo-Saxon for self-government: but so-,
ber Becord thought remlnds.us thaf the
union under which: we . now live was
formed by* blood and Iron, and In much
heavier doses than fell to the lot of Ger
many in 1SS6 and, 1870,
sia. foreseeing the is3ue. made a treatv
with the tax union (Hanover. Oldenburg
and Schaumburgr-Uppej-, which, in any
event, would Insure vrobstructed com
munication between the eastern and west
ern sections of the Kingdom, and then
refused to make any' changes in the cus
toms union that werÂ» not in harmony
with the treaty with che tax union. H*a
customs union would expire In 1S54, and
Austria proposed one which would In
clude all Germany under her leadership.
Prussia, guided by Bismark, refused to
admit Austria into th"Â» Zollverein. or to
belong to one under her influence. The
issue was made and the South German
states had to choose between their prefer
ences and their financial interests, for
their revenues would be greater from a
union with Prussia and without Austria
than from a Â«nlon with Austria and with
out Prussia. Bismarck calmly insisted,
trusting in the strength of Prussia's com
mercial position. The southern states,
after proposing to adhere to Austria Â»f
she would make up to them for their
losses and receiving her refusal reluctant
ly stayed by the old union, which w i-Â»
renewed (1S54) for twelve years, Austria
was thus definitely shut out of a com
mercial union of Germany, which com
prised nearly all the slates of the future
empire. -
Before the expiration of the union tho
time had come to determine whether
Austria could be excluded from a political
union of German states as she had been
from the commercial one. The immediate
causes of the Var of lstW cannot be ex
amined in the space at our disposal.
When it broke out it assumed the appear
ance of an attempt on the part of tho
states of the con fede ration, under tli*
lead of Austria, to coerce Prussia, with
the result that Prussia declaredthe at
tempt a violation of the constitution and
withdrew from the Diet. The war that
followed Â¦was one of the shortest and most
decisive in history. Stvcn weeks of fight
ing put Prussia In control of Germany
and expelled Austria, -â¢,.
The constitution of the North German
Confederation i.l!>4>6), as it was called, was
drafted by representatives of the mon
archs, submitted for a revision to a naÂ»
tlonal convention elected by manhood suf
frage representing the people, and finally
ratified by the legislatures or diets of the
r^spectlvca states Each of the rival
forces in the new Germany received rec
ognition. Upon Prussia was conferred
tho federal executive or presidency, the
princes were represented in the federal
council -and the people In the imperial par
liament. In. form, again, the constitution
was a "perpetual alliance" of the princes
end the senates of the free cities. In fact.
It was a federal constitution.
Provision was made for admitting either
or all of the four south German states-
Bavaria. Wurttemberg. Baden and Hesse
âand meantime to facilitate the result
Bismarck resorted to the device of the
customs union. Instead of, securing: uni
formity of tariff rates by commercal trat
les uniform tariffs were enacted by a tar
iff parliament, consisting of the parlia
ment of the confedf ration increased by a
proprotlonate number of representatives
from the south German states. But thÂ»
jealousy and hostility toward Prussia waa
not to be overcome quickly or throtigu
peaceful evolution. Blood and iron wet*
again invoked. *
A united Germany was a combinariGM.
too formidable to -the prestige of Napoleon
III to be allowed if ,it could be presented,
and war with France Bismarck regarded
as no less Inevitable than it had been with
Austria. Such a struggle with the hered
itary enemy In such a cause would unite
north and south Germany. He availed
htmself of the situation with marvelous
skill and nerve, and when the war came,
supported by arms and equally resistless
national enthusiasm, he was able to
sec the union of Germany completed and
the King ot Prussia crowned Emperor In
Versailles January. 1S71. The restoration
of the old names of empire and Kmperot
stands for no essential change In the con
stitution of the North German Confedera
tion. - It was merely a concession to his
torical associations. Alsace and Lorraine,
wrested from. France, were not annexed
to Prussia, but to the empire. As a terri
torial dependency they do not enjoy self
government nor .representation In tho fed
eral council. . Â¦
The establishment of the empire, much
as It has done for Germany, has failed
short of the Ideals and hopes of the pa
triots and liberals cf the first half of thÂ«
century. It is a union which does nol
comprise- all- Germans and <Joe<s include
Poles. Danes and Frenchmen brought ir.
through the territorial annexations ot
Prussia, and It Is p government In whfch
sovereignty Is lodged In the monarchs and
not in the people. The constitution ot thÂ«
empire, has no articles . specifying thÂ«
rights of tho individual like those which
constituted so essential a part of the abor
tive constitution elaborated by the nation
al assembly In 1W.

yet In sight.
Dr. Winslow Anderson Claims All
Charges Are Untrue.
MAKES GENERAL DENIAX.
Dr. "vVinslow Anderson has sent in the
following communication:
To the Editor of The Call: I have read the
article published in The Call of December 6
and desire to correct some ot the false *tate
ments it contains.
Firstâ I deny absolutely that any graduate of
th*- College of Physicians and Surgeons of San
FTanclsco either in dentistry* or in pharmacy
f^ practicing medicine under the guise of a
d> nt.il or pharmaceutical diploma.
Secondâ Students have failed at our final ex
aminations and have gone to other colleges to
Krcduate. Students have failed at other col
leges and have come to ours to graduate after
hi>vlng passed the last or senior year In our
s(hoo< and taking the senior or final examina
tions with the class. Several men have come
to us from other colleges in which they failed,
spending one full year with us and failed a.
second timeâ some of them, after spending two
years with uc, making six years In all In medi
cal colleges, have failed for a third time, all
oC which facts arÂ© a matter -of record In the.
dean's offlce.
Thirdâ X<J diploma has ever been granted to
: ny Mwicw- who has not worked faithfully, mid
honestly for the same and passed the required
public examinations, which the men who have
ltslgned well know, as the signatures of Dr.
Inline and I>r. Potter are on all the diplomas
issued by this college, excepting in the case
of Dr. Totter, who was in Manila last year.
Fourthâ I have never stated nor written that
the College of Physicians and Surgeons was
a "long-felt want,"' although I am proud to
say, owing u> the untiring efforts of the loyal
men on the board of trustees and the excellent
personnel of the faculties, numbering now
about seventy, the college is In a prosperous
condition with about 3C0 student?.
Fifthâ No doubt the real reason of Dr. Pot
ter's resignation, besides those already given,
will proba.bly be found In the' fact that he was
requested by the Building and Loan Association
to sign a note for $23,000.- which the other trus
tees of the college had already signed. In any
event his resignation was:. handed In. a few
dcys after his signature was requested. .-~- _^
- Hlxthâ It is absolutely untrue* that Dr. W. F.
Sr.uthard. IJr. S. B. Koblcke and Dr. E. E.
Kelly have resigned. l>r. S. . M. Mouser re
slRned some three years ago, according to his
own statement principally on account o( the
position Dr. Potter took regarding administra
tive affairs and a .threatened encounter in
th* collepe build Inc some time previously. r>r.
.1. U. I^alne resigned about the beginning of
tills' year. Dr. Potter resigned about two
months ago and Dr. Regensburger resigned
about a week ago. â¢ . ..-Â¦ " Â¦ '%
Seventh;â I . disclaim the accusation that the
ccllese is Â¦ a 'â¢one-man;-?chool." ; It Is true I

The German National Assembly In 198
framed" a constitution for an empire, and
elected the King of Prussia Emperor; but
he could not accept a crown from the
people whose right- to offer it he deniel.
nor under these circumstancesâ the war
with Austria for supremacyâ which such.
an acceptance .would have precipitated.
Thia war with Austria must be avoided
until Prussia had so equipped herself a-Â»
to make victory fairly certain.
Before it came there was a peaceful
trial of strength of position between Prus
sia and Austria that forecast the> futuro
for those who could Interpret it. Austria,
realizing the advantages accruing tÂ«>
Prussia from the customs union, planned
to gain admission to it to displace Prus

of the union too low to suit them. Prus-
The most signal changes that have
taken place In the. political geography of
Europe In consequence of wars since 1S13
have been the unification of Germany and
of Italy and the redemption of Greece,
Roumania and the Balkan states from the
sway of the Turk. As the course and sig
nificance of these transformations can be
more clearly presented by taking" each
subject by Itself and following It through,
that method will be adopted in the re
maining articles of this series.
The alliance of the German princes In
1S15 (the German confederation) promised
little but a certain union of action In re
pressing political progress, and it is in
another quarter that we must look for
of the college since Its Inception and it is also
ti ue .that I have no more to do with the man
atrtment than any other one man on the board
of trustees.
Eighth â Regarding the statements purporting
to come from Dr. J. R. Lalne I will reply,
'â¢more in sorrow than in anger," that in the
building project Dr. Lalne and myself prom
ised to furnish the additional means required
for the purchase of the lot. I kept my agree
ment and furnished the principal of this
amount personally. - :
Ninthâ RecardinB expert examinations of the
college- books, 1 take the following from our
records, partly written by Dr. Potter himself:
The books cf the institution were examined for
the first time October 13, 1897, by Mr. Mason,
expert, with Drs. Laine and Potter as a com
mittee in charge. They were examined a sec
ond time by. the exixrt. D. W. Kolger,- March
26. 1899. at Dr. Lalne'*- special request, and
Dr. Lalne employed his own special expert. The
books were examined a third time by Mr. H.
H. .Zobpl. expert. January 4. 1900. They were
again examined by one of the best experts in
the State. Â»ir^ Brandon. Octoher 1. 19'X). Hence
It will be Â«fÂ«n that our college books have
been exported at least four different times
and the statements attributed to Dr. Lalrw
are nut based on knowledge. I
Tenthâ I never constituted myself " treasurer,
auditor and paymaster," as we had a board
of seven trustees to administer the affairs of.
the college. Dr. Southhard has Issued every
check for all payments since the Inception of
the college until the present timer excepting
one for several hundred dollars which perhaps
Dr. Lalne can better explain himself, as the
funds were turned over to him and as yet- the
board has received no accounting. Dr. Llin*
or no one else ever heard me declare
"the whole thing," although 1 have prevented
at times the inauguration of disastrous poli
cies.
Eleventhâ It Is absolutely untrue that I "hold
the sword of Damocles" over any man, woman
or child as stated, and the' plain truth as re
gards Dr. Lalne's resignation from the college
is simply this, that the board of trustees to' a
man favored the methods of administration that
had been In vogue since the extablishmc-nt of
the college and rejected in toto "the reforms"
introduced by Dr. Lalne to such an extent that
he could not even gef a second to his reso
lution. . . â¢ â¢
Twelfthâ It !s untrue that Mrs. Dr. Southhard
furnl3hed any money toward the purchase of
the lot av stated. Â¦ It Is also untrue that I ob-
Jfrttii to the redemption of the notes when the
college had : the means to pay them, as th"
records will show. It. t was I who made, the
original motion: to have- these notes taken up.
Thirteenthâ Dr. Potter and I had charge of
passing upon the credentials of students who
came . to xisrfrom other colleges and of grad
uates in- medicine who desires' to enter thfl
College of Physicians ?and Surgeons. When
Dr...Pottcrleft Tor. Manila and Dr. Kod<?head
was made secretary pro tern, he also- filled Pot
ter's place on this committee. Whenever there
wns any, doubt or question as. to the admis
sion 1 of a candidate the matter was brought be
fore the whole board with properly filled Out
and sworn â¢ affidavits from the candidates, as
the records will show.
Fourteenthâ As to any "trick" or "device"
of which Dr. Laine IÂ« reported to have spoken.
I .must .confess that I. am at a loss to under
stand what he, means." For four years we sat
together upon the State Board of Health, he
bcinR the, "secretary. . For four years we werÂ«
upon the board of trustees of the College of
Physicians and Surgeons, and It was not until
hlÂ» "reform" schemes were Introduced and
failed "Â«f acceptance by all the members of
â¢the board .that he found "any "device" for my
own financial' or personal advancement.
Fifteenthâ ThÂ« number of men who have re
signed within the last year is three. No one
questions their professional Ability as teachers,
but It Is a notable fact that Dr. X^aine has
probably never delivered twenty lectures In the
coll'K"? hall. Dr. Potter has been away in
Manila f or â¢ two Â¦ years and Dr. .Fiegensburger
prpbablydldnot average twenty lectures a year,
so that.lt became necessary for us long; ajfo
to find other men to do their work. Dr. 1-aine's
work In surgery has been ably conducted by
Professor J. H. Healy. Professor W. A. Mor
ton and Professor K. P. Howard. Dr. Potter's
work in medicine has been ably and faithfully
pÂ«Â»rfonÂ«iPd by Professor C. H. Itosenthal. Pro
fewsor II. d'Arcy Power, Professor George
Adam and Professor F. "W. Lux. Dr. Itegens
burRT's chair has-, been ably filled by Profen
sor A. P. Woodward, who has done nine-tentiig
of the work in this department since the col
leRe, opened, so that the college has In no
wise lost by these resignations.

GOVERNING BOARD OF DOCTORS ABOUT
TO TAKE ANDERSON'S CASE IN HAND
FeMow Physicians Will 1 investigate Reports of Uinprofessioinal "Cooduct
Sim Awarding Diplooias amd Getting Fees.
WAR is on in earnest among the
doctors who now hold and
those who formerly held posi
tions on the faculty of the
College of- Physicians.
The storm seems to be breaking around
the head of Dr. Winslow Anderson and
there is a party for and a party against
him. f
The autonomy of the cillege, of which
the much berated doctor is said to be the
very head and front, is threatened with
legal disruption and even the solemn
binding obligation of a doctor's oath wilt
not,, prevent the members of the profes
sion talking out of' school.
Cumulative evidence concerning the
practicr-s of some of the members of the
faculty of the sc-hool is easily obtainable.
Dr. Anderson's friends and supporters are
rallying to his cause, endeavoring if possi
ble to stay the storm. Jealousy may be a
paramount factor in some of the asser
tions made, but the fact remains that the
graduates Â«*f tn<Â« college of PhjjIrfMu aâ¢
Surgeons arc not received with the same
degree of consideration that Jjff^gg

opponent of the present regime 1* Â°Â«Â£ <Â«
town and will not return for sever al d a> b.
When he comes It is expected that the op
position will blossom forth in full strength
and that a judicial inquiry into the con
duct of the institution will be . com^f,=^f;
Dr. Potter is one of the original trustees
and is in a position, so says the opposi
tion, to -niaue Rome nowl. Just wnat
Dr. Potter has up his sleeve professional
courtesv prevents othere from saying.
The gk-t of Dr. Potter's objections is
that during the last two years many
changes of policy and administration lm\e
been inaugurated by the board of trus
tees Some of thes*- changes, he alleges,
are inimical to the. best interests of the
institution and are in direct violation pi
the articles of incorporation and the pub
lished rules of the Institution.
"The result Is." says r>r. Potter In his
plaint, "that the College of Physicians
and Snrgeons of San Kranclsco has been
seriously injured in reputation and has
lost the full confidence of the best ele
ments of the medical profession of this
city and State."
But t>r. Anderson's friends now come
back and say that Potter is a mlschief
breeder; thai he talks out of school ana
time and season; that he is disgruntled;
but none *oem to be ready to take issue
with him.
However, the fight bPtwcen the factions
is so acute and the charges made are so
grave that application has already been
made to the~board of censors of the San
Francisco 'Medical Society for an Inves
tigation. This body, composed of the
most potent. grave and reverend
peignors of the rirof^sMori' hears all evi
dence, determinedly deliberates and then
renders judgment. Its flat is final; there
is no appeal, for the society is governed
by the strictest possible rules.
Professor William J. Jackson of the
department of pharmacy, is one of the
stanchest adherents of the present man
agement of the College of Physicians and
Surgeons. So far this department, of
which he Is the dean and second only in
authority to Dr. Anderson, seems to have
i escaped the tire of criticism heaped upon
the medical and dental departments. In
defense of Dr. Anderson, Professor Jack
son says:
"Dr. Potter's grievances In the college
are that the six trustees would not per
mit him to run things his own way. He
: did not believe in buying a lot. nor i;i
erecting a building for the college. Ho
wanted to draw down the college earnings
instead of building up a magnificent In
stitution. It -v.-as pa-lly on his account
that Dr. Mouser resigned. The board of
trustees is under no obligation to account
for any funds to the faculties, becaune
they are the pole and absolute managers
of Che college, as the civil code provides.
"The reasons for the resignation of
Doctors Laine and Mouser can best be
explained by themselves. The reason' Dr.
Regensburg'er resigned was because it
was not considered desirable to have him
a member of the board of trustees
Another reason for the resignation of
these men is undoubtedly the fact that
there will be no compensation for teach
ing for some years to tome, as the funds
are devoted to paying the cost of the col
lege building and its equipment, a propo
sition of which the board of trustees
must have absolute control.
"Dr. Kelly is dissatisfied because there
is a -better man teaching anatomy than
he, and he is antagonistic to the board of
trustees. Three years ago he voted for
Dr. Kerr for president of the State Med
ical Society in place of Dr. McNutt, who
was the -choice of the College of Physi
cians and Surgeons. Dr. Regensburger
1 has always been growling about his pound
of flesh. The average expense of run
ning the college has been $1000 per
month, all of which has been paid out In
checks on the First National Bank. The
resignations of these men have been very
opportune, as theit chairs are filled by
! abler men. The college authorities court
Investigation."
Graduates of the medical department or
the College of Physicians and Surgeons
I ane adverse to lotting the world know
i how they got through, but the members
j of the dental department seem more will

the dental department was organized, the

and that soon after he completed his
course and got his diploma. Others in
I the same class objected to the proceeding

about the matter and every effort was
made to hush It up. Now that the medl

NEW YORK. Dec. Câ A determined effort
xirar manifest in the t'ock market to start a
renewal of speculation for a rise. In the early
dealings there was a fair degree of success
attending the effort under the influence of
Â¦triklnff gains in a few stocks. Strength per
tisted in a few stock? throughout the day, but
it Â«a; offset during the later part of the day
by equally rtriklng los.Â«-^ in tome of the lead
ing specialties. A large part of the list fell
>>ack to about last night's level and wavered
in an uncertain way until the closing, which
was genera!!)- easy. The rally in this market
late yesterday was tak-n as a cue by t the Lon
don market this morning. Foreign markets
have showed a growing disposition of late to
follow Wall ftreet'F lead and the rally yes
terday afternoon was pronounced by some ob
servers ee due to manipulation with the pur
pose of Inviting buying of Americans in Lon
don to-day. If this was the purpose it was
Fucceseful. for London bought stocks here at
the opening, helping on the rise. There was
a oonFiderable ehort interest, as a result of
the weakness of the market early In the week.
Â¦which proved vulnerable to the rather impos
ing show of strength this morning and the
covering movement helped on the rise. Even
among those stocks where were afterward
tl:e weakest there- were some considerable gains
during the early strength, both Sugar and
Tennessee Coal getting up about a point. Quite
a number of important stocks achieved gains
rif nearly a point, but a careful scrutiny of
the market showed that the movement all day
was distinctly one of *pecial fitocks. The low
priced non-dividend stocks were the favorites,
especially the Eries and the Wabash issues,
both Mocks and bonds. Xothlng authoritative
c-ould be learned to explain this movement,
which tumor attributed both to buying for
Vanderbllt control and' to jo'.nt plans for con
eoildation through traffic arrangements of the
two lines. The rise extended to over 2 points
in Erie flirt preferred and to 1% for second
preferred and both clwwd at about the top,
being practically the only 6tocks In the list
to do bo. Besides these stocks there were up
ward of thirty etocks selling under 49 which
were advanced from S4 to 1%. The increase in
the dividend rate for the half-year on Denver
and Rio Grande preferred from 2 to 2% per
cpuX caused a late advance in that ctock of
1\ and in the common, stock of l\i. This
caused a sympathetic hardening In the market,
but prir*s did not hold in face of the renewed
Wf-akneii In the specialties. There was no ap
preciable change In money market conditions.
The bond market was active and consistently
strong, many low-grade Junior and contingent

WEATHER CONDITIONS AND GENERAL
CHICAGO, Dec. 6.â January wheat opened
W8\c to %Q\ic lower at 71H@"U;c, influenced
by a decline at Liverpool. A bit of buying on
yesterday's export sales, nfty-flve loads of
wheat and 100.000 barrels of flour, rallied the
price to 71^(& 71%c during the first hour, but
the bulge did not hold. Considerable long |
wheat came out during the forenoon and al- 1
though the afternoon saw less liquidation the j
liberal receipts and lack of outside support
kept the price on the downward road. At
70\c, which was reached about 1 o'clock, the
market steadied and reacted to 71c, shorts tak
ing profits, but the ray of hope thus given
holders was Eoon lost and the close was weak
at the bottom, vÂ»#lc under yesterday, at 70%c.

some later in sympathy with the wheat weak
i nees. Shorts were still on the anxious seat.

Because, It Is Thought, of Quar
i^l With His Sweetheart.
F. E. GrottHln, a tailor, in the employ
of C. T. Sanders, swallowed the contents
of a two-ounce vial of chloroform In an
attempt .to end his life last at his resi
dence, 29 Twelfth street.
Grottaln was taken to the City Re
ceiving Hospital, where Drs. Dray and
Bnclgalupl worked In an effort' to restore
him to consciousness, but without avail.
Grottain's father accompanied him to
the hospital. He said that he knew of
no reason for his son's act. Omer Greer,
who occupied the room with Grottaln,
told the hospital attendants that the last
named when retiring had remarked that
he was about to take a long sleep. Soon
after going to bed he commenced to groan
and complained of severe pains. As he
grew rapidly worse a physician was sent
for and after an examination telephoned
for the hospital ambulance.
Grottaln up to a few days ago had been
keeping company with a young woman.
It Is thought that he quarreled with his
sweetheart and in a moment of despond
ency attempted suicide.
The hospital ambulance broke an axle
on its return soon after leaving Grottain's
home and the City Hall patrol wagon
was sent for to finish the journey, caus
ing quite a delay.

ORDINANCE TO PAVE
DOWNTOWN STREETS
Supervisors Will Attempt to Pass It
by Fourteen Votes and Ignore
Board of Works.
The Supervisors' Street Committee yes
terday recommended for passage an ordi
nance providing for the paving of Clay,
Sacramento, Washington and Pine streets,
between Montgomery and Sansome, with
bituminous rock or asphalt on a concrete
foundation. The Board of Works In a
communication declined to make a recom
mendation for that kind of pavement, and
an attempt will be made to pass the ordi
nance by a vote of 14 members, as the
charter provides. There is some doubt ex
pressed whether such a procedure is legal,
because there are no specifications on file
allowing the use of asphalt for street pav
ing.
The opinion of the City Attorney re
garding the power of the board to open
certain streets In the district south of
Channel street was referred to the Joint
Committee on Streets and Judiciary. The
petition of the Market-street Railway
Company for a franchise for two blocks
along Townsend and Second street went
over for one week. Jere T. Burke stated
that the purport of the franchise was to
avoid blocking of cars on Third street and
to provide connection between the Fifth
street line and the Mail dock.

Chinese Expect Trouble.
Owing to recent highbinder troubles in

tongs last year, and a settlement was never
effected. It subsided during the summer
months, but after the return of the fish
ermen from the north broke out anew.
Last night the See Yup Society held a
meeting for the purpose of keeping the
trouble confined to the scene of its origin,
but nothing was accomplished. The Suey

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET. N.
W.. WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.â In view of
the reported efforts of Vickers Sons and
Maxim of Kngland to form a business
union with the Cramps Shlp-Buildlng
Company and the Mldvale Steel Works,
Charles H. Cramp, president of the
Cramp Company, who Is In Washington
in connection with the proposals of the
Navy Department for building war ves
sels, decided to make a statement ex
planatory of the plans to extend the plant
of the company. He said:
"For a number of years I have endeav
ored to enlarge our plant and to extend
its capabilities to the point of building
first-class warships complete, ready to go
Into action when delivered, Including not
only the hull, machinery and equipment,
but also armor, guns and ammunition.
My views as to the desirability of such
extensions have been more than justified
by the phenomenal success of the Arm-
Strong Company. For example, about the
time we began to build the Baltimore,
Armstrong, who was then making guns
only at Elswlck, enlarged his place by
the addition of a ship-building plant,
which was already not only firmly estab
lished, but possessed perhaps the best
and most ample technical staff In its or
ganization In all Europe. They are now
employing fifteen thousand men and their
dividends have amounted to millions.
"About the same time the Vickers Com
pany, the great steel establishment,
which has been making armor, forcings,
shafting and other steel products, ab
sorbed the Barrow Ship-buildnng Com
pany. They have since been turning out
ships complete and ready to go Into ac
tion, the same as Armstrong, with like
success, mechanically and otherwise.
"The great firm of Thomas Bros, has
been consolidated with the Kohn-Brown
Co. of Sheffield. The Thomas Iron Works
also, I understand, have a co-operative ar
rangement with one of the principal steel
plants in England. Then Krupps have
bought a ship-building plant at Kiel, and
now have a large number of vessels under
construction, five of them being for the
German Government. At the same time
the ship-building plant of Forges et
Chantiers at La Seyne, France, has con
solidated with the Creusot Steel Company,
and also with the Canet Gun Manu
factory, and with great success. /These
several concerns are now ready to build
for various countries of the world com
plete fighting ships, ready to go into
action when delivered.
"Without going Into details or without
stating the principal direction In which
I have been endeavoring to operate. I
will say that the Idea underlying all my
efforts has been to enlarge as much as
possible under our single management all
-diverse Industries which enter Into the
construction of ships of war. In order that
we may realize to the best advantage all
experience which we have gathered in two

W.. WASHINGTON. Dec. Â«.â William L.
Merry of San Francisco. United States
Minister to Nicaragua and Costa Rica,
arrived In Washington to-day and saw
Secretary Hay. He declined to-night to
discuss what had occurred at the State
Department.
"I can only discuss the sentiment that
exists in Nicaragua and Costa Rica," he
said, "regarding the projected canal.
The governments and the peoples are In
tensely Interested In tnÂ» construction of
the waterway and are willing to do all
they can to facilitate the commencement
of work.
"They are heartily In favor of the Hay-
Pauncefote convention and arÂ« hopÂ«ftxl
that the neutrality feature especially will
be retained. In fact, they would like to
have the treaty ratified without amend
ment. It is believed In Ceneral America
that recosrnltion of the neutrality of the
canal will remove any possible scene of
conflict from the waterway. Personally I
am heartily in favor of thÂ© treaty.
"Nicaragua and Costa Rica have taken
action which has removed all difficulties
In the way of the construction of the
canal by the United States. The Xlcara
puan Government has declared the con
cession of the Maritime Canal Company
to be forfeited, but it seems to me that
morally the United States is indebted to
the company to a certain extent. The
company has kept the canal open for
American construction for the last thir
teen years. It has made expensive sur
\-eyg which have been utilized by this
Government, and finally It has done much
to educate the people of the country up
to the necessity of a canal."

After mature consideration by the full

"The American Federation," said Sec
retary Morrison, "is nowMn a position,
numerically and financially, to accomplish
during the coming year more remarkable
results than have been achieved during
the present year. Members of unions are
beginning to realize that higher dues and
united action are necessary for success."
At the afternoon session Secretary
Prank Morrison presented his report,
which was unanimously adopted.
We had at the end of the fiscal year October
31, 1900, affiliated with the American Federa
tion of Labor: national and International
unions, 82; State federations, 16; city Central
Labor Unions, 206; local trade unions and fed
eral labor unions, 1061.
Through more compact and better equipped
trade unions have come Joint agreements and
conciliations between the workmen and as
sociated employers, and only when conciliation
has failed has It been necessary to resort to
arbitration, and. then the only successful arbi
tration was an arbitration voluntarily entered
Into. Thft more thoroughly the workers are
organized in their local and national unions
and federated by common bond, policy and
polity the better shall we bo able to avert
strikes and lockouts, secure conciliations, and,
if necessary, arbitration, but it must be volun
tary arbitration or there should be no arbitra
tion st all. -
Realizing the necessity for the unity of the
wage-earners of our country, the American
Federation of Labor has upon all occasions de
claied that trades unions | should open their
portals to all wageworkers, irrespective of
creed, color, nationality, sex or politics.
Unless we ehall give the negro workers the
opportunity to organize and thus place them
whero they can protect and defend themselves
against the rapacity and cupidity of their em
ployers; unless we continue the policy of en
deavoring to make friends of them, there can
be no question that they will not only be
forced down in the economic scale and be used
against any effort made by us for our economic
social advancement, but race prejudices will
be mace more bitter and to. the injury of all.
The 'alien contract labor law falls far short
of the accomplishment of what it was original
ly Intended to do, for the reason that viola
tors of the law are easily and systematically
coached how to pass the inspection. The en
actment of wise and beneficent legislation in
the Interests of the toiling masses of the coun
try must still be demanded until all the wrongs
from which the tollers suffer are abated.
It cannot be denied that much faster and
greater progress can be made and will be
made, provided we are firm In our determina
tion to achieve It, unceasing In our efforts and
undivided in our course.
At the conclusion cf President Gompers'
address a recess was taken.
The past year has witnessed a most remark
able crowth In organization among the work
ers, who have realized that there Is no pro
tection for their interests or hope for Justice
and freedom In the future, unless It results
from the unity of the wageworklng masses.
We have issued direct from the, American
Federation of Labor during- the past year 849
chartersâ to national and International unions,
14; State Federations of Labors, 5; city Central
Labor Unions, 96; local trade unions (having
no national), 484; federal labor unions, 250.

Relative to the
Wages.
HOUSTON, Tex., Dec. 6.â The telegra
phers belonging to the Order of Railway
Telegraphers on the Gulf. Colorado and
Santa Fe road, extending from Galveston
to Purcell, I. T., left their desks at 11
o'clock to-day. Passenger trains are be
ing operated on running orders from
junction" points and through freights are
also being handled, although there is con
siderable delay. The strike has been ex
pected for some time. A committee of the
Order of Railway Telegraphers went to
Galveston to hold a conference with Gen
eral Manager Polk, to whom they had
presented their grievances. The latter was
in communication with President Ripley,
and it is said by the men that the latter
official refused to yield onevery point, as
well as that of ten consecutive hours of
rest for the operators. The operators say
they expect to gain the active co-opera
tion of other railroad organizations.
CHICAGO, Dec. 6.â At the Santa Fe of
fices in this city the following statement
regarding the strike was given out:
"The operators made a demand for an
increase in wages and for changes in rules
and regulations governing their services
on November 13 last, in the absence of the
general manager. A meeting with a com
mittee of operators was had November
26, when the company made the proposi
tion to the committee to allow operators
employed on the Gulf lines the same rules
and regulations as were in vogue on the
Santa Fe lines west of Albuquerque No
vember 15, which rules and regulations are
the same as were adopted and applied qn
the Atchison road proper July 1 last. The
company also agreed to pay the same
wage rates as were commonly paid by
other roads in Texas, and in the event of
the committee and company failing to
agree as to wage rates they were to be de
termined by arbitration. In other words,
the rules and regulations governing the
employment of operators in force and ac
cepted by operators on the Atchison prop
er and on lines of the Santa Fe system
west of Albuquerque were to be applied, to
operators employed on the Gulf lines, and
if the telegraphers' committee could not
agree with the company as to wage rates
to be paid they were to be determined by
arbitration. Several meetings were had
with the committee, and at length the
proposition of the company as stated,
was accepted. Subsequently, however, it
was rejected and tne strike ordered."

ELDORADO, Kans., DÂ«c. 6.â Testimony
in favor of Miss Jessie Morrison was
taken to-day, the prosecution finishing its
side .of the case ?oon after the opening
of court this morning and the defense ex
amining several of its witnesses in their
efforts to prove their assertion of self
defense. . ' â¢
The prisoner showed signs of physical
and mental collapse and it wa* onry with
great effort that she was enabled to-re
main In the courtroom during the day.
Her fainting spell last night, followed by
a fit of crying, had left her In a weakened
condition and fear was expressed that the
prisoner would not hold out until the close
of the trial and that a continuance would
have to be asked. . Judge Redden, her
leading counsel, said that it was not at
all certain that the' prisoner would be
able to hold up under the strain.
"Last night, said he, "she was feeling
very badly. I do not know what may
happen."
Miss Morrison fainted last night as she
reached her cell after a trying day in the
courtroom. She had revived somewhat
this morning and was more cheerful, but
was pale and weak. She had received a
cluster of roses from an admirer, by ex
press. She seemed happy over the flowers
and wore them into court
Captain Waters, who Is leading for the
prosecution. Is quoted as saying he ex
pected a continuances would be asked by
the defense.
"It is plain," said he, "that 6he is get
ting weaker and It is no wonder. It
would not surprise me to have presented
at any time a phy3iclan's certificate to
the effect that Jessie Morrison could not
go on with the trial."
Such a continuance would postpone the
trial Indefinitely and make necessary the
selection of a new jury and a rehearing
of all evidence. It is doubtful if another
set of twelve men who have not formed
an opinion on the case would be found in
the county.
The State this morning closed its side of
the case and the defense put its first wit
ness on the stand. Â»
The last witness for the prosecution was
Dr. Fulllnwider, ona of the physicians
who attended Mrs. Castle. He repeated
the testimony concerning the manner in
which the * dying statement was made.
Then Prosecutor Btumback read to the
jury the dying declaration, as abridged by
the court. He read with great delibera
tion, putting emphasis on each telling
sentence .and the Jury followed him
closely.
The defense say they propose to show
that Mrs. Castle called Jessie Morrleon
into her house and began a quarrel. They
have a witness to prove this, they say,
and Miss Morrison'6 own testimony will,
it is declared, make convincing the testi
mony of the witnesses for the defense
who have preceded her.
The first witness for the defense was
Mrs. Emma Grover, who made the offi
cial record at the preliminary -hearing of
the prisoner. She identified the records
in which Mrs. Emma Spangler testified
that she had seen nothing in the hand of
Jessie Morrison on the morning of the-fa
tal quarrel. During the present trial Mrs.
Spangler said she thought there was a
blade in Miss Morrison's hand.
W. W. Bugbee, Mayor of Eldorado, tes
tified to a conversation had with Mrs.
Spangler in June. He said:
"I asked Mrs. Spangler whether Jessie
Morrison had a weapon in her hand after
her fight with Mrs. Castle, and Mrs.
Spangler said that she had not."
Mrs. O. It. Cline told of a party at her
house last spring before the Castle wed
ding, at which both Miss Morrison and
Miss Wiley were present. Miss Wiley had
arrived first, and when Miss Morrison
came in Miss Wiley did not notice her.

Crocker 'Estate Will Soon Decide
What to Do With Calvary
Church. Property.
C. E. Green, secretary of the Crocker
estate, stated yesterday that early in Jan
uary a decision would be reached relative
to the kind of building that will be erect
ed on the site of the present Calvary
Presbyterian Church, corner of Geary and
Powell streets.
It seems to be pretty well understood
that a hotel wNl be built. A local hotel
man is authority for the statement that
he had been asked to take the manage
ment of the proposed new hostelry for a
term of years. Mr. Green said yesterday
that Mr. Scott, who also has charge of
the handling of the Crocker estate, will
return from the Ea3t the latter part of
this month when a meeting would be held
and the matter of building will be finally
determined.
Mr. Green said that there appears to
be a good field for another large, first
class hotel in this city. The location, he
paid, is an ideal one and personally he
favored the erection of a hostelry in
preference to an office building. The work
of tearing down the church is now well
under way, a large force of men having
been put to work thi3 week. The time al
lowed the church people to remove the
structure has nearly expired, but Mr.
Green said the estate was not disposed to
hurry the society, although it is desired
to begin work on a new building early
the coming year.
A TIDAL WAVE.
Extending Many Allies in Each Di-
rection but AH Centering in
One Point
A tidal wave of magnitude such as has
never been heard of before on this coast
struck this city yesterday with a flood of
piano bargains at 230 Post street, where
Hockett Brothers & Co. are closing
out their entire stock at unheard of
prices. We are going, out: of the piano
business, and every piano is marked In
plain .figures at the wholesale price.
High grade standard makes all included
in this sale. Store must be vacated in a
few days. Judging from the way they
sold yesterday the whole stock will be
sold long before the expiration of the ten
days to be devoted to this affair for
yourself. If they go as fast for the bal
ance of the ten days, we will have closed
out before the expiration of the allotted
time.
You can actually secure from us to
morrow a good piano for the price of an
organ. Do you know what cost price
means on a piano? If you don't, come
in and wo will show you and you will
be -wiser, even if you don't purchase
from us. Open evenings. Don't delay,
or you'll lose your choice. L 'Â¦'*.!<
