3Did You Ever Try
to Photograph
an Indian?
THERE is tot ,,{ P feat more difficult
than I&tzodacX an Indian to the
bathtub, irni fc : ,t Is to make him
face a camera.' K. S. Curtis is prob
ably the only -^ f face" who Is past
grand master oi tnÂ»- irt of photographing
Indians. The faunwj Curtis collection of
Indian pictures r.uwVm exhibition at the
art store or WlUfon Morris Is attracting
a great deal of â¢ i ti meÂ»t. The pictures
won the first pri/,- u the recent National
Photographic Ctarvt] tion. and aside from
Ihclr photograph , artistic value they
are of ethno'^. t , .-; Leresfc
For the koi.i! i>.Jj thesu pictures are
irresistible. Only ;fc "button pressers"
realize the difflc;:.tvif photographing In
dians. To go an; ..j the red men armed
with a camera tJtj means inevitable
defeat. The 1 .<! .;s the photographer's
Waterloo.
There isn't any Mystery about thÂ»>
methods of Mr. . u^s. The averasrÂ«- In
dian -will neither iA cajoled nor bullied
into posing. Mr. Curtis does very littlo
urging. His rule isgan old one â "money
talks." It is with fold and silver bait
that he catches thÂ« Indian and '-harms
away his lngrai^f aversion for the
camera.
ThÂ« average Irxl^n, says, Mr. Curtis,
has a price for his superstitious camera
misgivings. Mr. C.ttls has been forced
to pay an obdurate Jidian as much aa ten
dollars to "look ple*ant. please." From
fifty cents to 1U> dclars- is the usual pay
ment dem.inded by :|e reluctant red man.
Mr. Curtis has tnfeled among alV sorts
and conditions of Ugians and has had all
manner of interesting experiences -with
them. Prom the frfceen peaks of Alaska

tis has folL.w â¢ Â¦<! In ;Â»â¢ wake of the Indian.

dance of the Mwpfc." says Mr. Curtis,
"is the sun dance of;the Blackfoot people.
The 'snake dance" of the Moquis hai

the friendship of White Calf, chief of the
Blackfoot tribe, tlut I was allowed to be

consented. I wft- nxl |! â¢ to fret him not

that I could remain among them, but must

It Is the Intention of Mr. Curtis to con
tinue his photographic work among th*Â»
Indians for at lea.-'t five years. He will
then have a collei-t'.cn of pictures not only
of artistic beauty but of historical im
portance.

Is, notwithstanding the stirring need for
him to arouse the sleeping ones, to teach
a broader Christianity than he could
preach from the pulpit he has left. That

people of the same blood.
In Saxony and Prussia, which are ex
tremely prosperous, suicide is common.
In Italy and Ireland, which are very poor.
It is rare. Â»
Suicide Is more prevalent in town than
in country.
The age at which suicide Is most fre
quent Is between 33 and 63.
Soldiers are of all men most subject to
suicideâ their Ufa is so melancholy and
monotonous In barracks in time of peace.
The number is 210 per 1.0OO.00Q in Eneland.
in Germany 530 and in Austria 1:T>9. In the
latter case this means a man a year in
every battalion.
Religion is the most powerful antidote to
the suicidal tendency. Italy and Ireland
are intensely religious. In the case of
Ireland it Is thought also that the habit
of emigration prevents suicide. "When a
man Is at his last gasp of despair he does
not kill himself; he goes to America.

I "^ nry c 'Â°cker and W. A. Bunting were
both timid, too. but they were not so
timid as to keep out entirely, and now
they are reported to have each of them
oil property worth over a miUlon dollars
value. .
R. \. Ellis of Hanfcrd didn't like to
risk any cash in r-troleum ventures., but
he had seme cVedlt and was willing to
stake that. The result Is that out of
nothing but hi 3 e cod word he has put
himself J73.00O away from poverty and te
is still on the up grade.
JÂ»ewÂ«papÂ«r men seem to know a good
thing when they see It. and as a result
the names of two Los Ancelans L E.
Mosher of the Times and W, L. G.' Hardi
son. now of the HeralJ. are among those
whom the oil fairies have favored.
Where all the money comes from Is a
marvel, but it grows more marvelous
when we. see what is still to follow.
There are nearly 40,000 square miles of
land in California's coast range, which
shows more or lÂ£sÂ« of oil Indications. The
oil sands are In some places hundreds of
feet in depth, and aa each cubic foot of
oil sand will hold a gallon or more of
crude oil the yield from a 'single acre Is
enough to make your eyes open.
So much for the supply.
One well near Newhall has poured out
over a million dollars' worth of ell. It
was bored in 1S73. and holds the record aa
having produced for the longest time of
any well in the world.
As to the demand. England alone uses
800,000 tons of petroleum products every
year, as much as the whole flow of all
the wens in the United States. Coal Is
getting short In England, too, and In
time there are going to be factories built
right here by tidewater where the fuel
Is plenty.
But those things are yet far in the fu
ture, as was the poftj business in Cali
fornia at the time when Sutter was build
ing his fort at Sacramento, and Marshall
was putting up a sawmill on the Ameri
can River for the purpose of supplying
the lumber for It.
This is the day. or these are the days
rather, to remember, and It may be well
for you to keep your eyes on petroleum
so that you will have plenty to tell about
the good old times when they have- passed
away, and we look regretfully back upon
them and grow reminiscent and excite
the envy of the next generation by recall
ing when men started with a shoestring
and ended with a fortune. In the "oil
days of ninety-nine and naughty."
WHY do people commit suicide? It
is- easy enough to answer "Be
cause they'<are miserable." How,
then, shall w-e account for the
fact that as the standard of comfort ad
vances suicide becomes more frequent?
The poorest laborer' in Europe has com
forts which were unknown to Queen Eliz
abeth and King Philip of Spain, yet the
rapidity with which suicide has increasd
is shown by the following' table:

Then one day the dull qid well hole In
which they had dropped so many dol

There is something strange about oil.
It makes men mysterious. You would
naturally suppose that gold would, most
of all. conduce to secrecy, but it Is not
so. The gold digger Is ever ready to
herald his strikes and Invite all mankind
to come and take up the next claim and
perhaps buy his. , That perhaps Is what
makes the -.differenceâ the gold miner does
riot know when his claim may come to its
end and '.he is always looking-for a good
chance to sell. Nat so with the oil men.
They have, n reasonable . assurance that
- their wells wlli â¢ flow as long as blool
flows in their own-veins and bqyond that
most of us do not seriously care. So with
no object In selling the 'oil' fn-h becomes
n buyer and wants to secure the oil landr

rush in and pump out the, styglan stream
that flows to the sunless sea beneath
him7\ â¢;Â¦,.;.â¢Â¦â¢â¢ r-- $ Â¦ "'.
Therefore every 'man In' the buslne?*
is cx-'oflicio a member,<if the Know-nothing
Club, an' organization which 'is ' created
for the purpose of.keeplng secrets. It has
no officers, no clubVooms. The initiation

Is better for all on- the lnsicle and If th<?
'outsiders want to eo'mVln they will have
to break in with 'a max" or drill In with n

who was Just closing an JSOO.OCO deal with

| So, too, thinks C. M. Kilburn, the Selma
druggist,, who put in a couple of thou
sand,-which ho could not spare any too
well, and has pulled out $75,000, and Is
still pulling out money hand overhand.
M. Sides and Walt Scott of the same

and have nearly as much profit to show
for It. S

would not suppose he cared for money or
would know how to make it if he did care

so much of a win in the .- oil business,
though. Louis Guggenheim thinks that
â¢ he is Just about it, because he made as
' much money as Poston and yet *he only
I invested $159 10.,. It is a good thing that
he put in the 10 cents, though, for at the
rate which his money increased he would
have lost the price of a piano if he hadn't.
That.soundsbfg v ,; doesn't It? Getting, a

Those are just a few of the people who
didn't take much to -.start in with. There
. are hundreds more of them, all laying

A year ago this expert of the Producers'
Oil Exchange looked over the field and
eald that it would be the greatest in the
world. That was at a time when the
oil was found only in spots. No one had
ventured the idea that from Humboldt
to Ban Dlepo was one vast field, only
varying In quality and depth of oil.
Sir.ee then there has been quite a crop
oi millionaire* raised on this very fertile
patch of poll and the crop that has al
ready passed the million mark and is
ready for harvest is nothing to the very
promising yri'jr.g shoots who are showing
above the surface with $25,000 or more to
their credit as the result of one year's
growth of their oil fortune.

But the great point of all in pipe smok
ing is to learn to smoke slowly. When
this habit is acquired the full flavor of
the tobacco will always be enjoyed, every
smoke will be a cool one and tongue
burning will be unknown. It is. however,
very hard for nervous people to smoke
slowly. We know of cases where smok
ers have tried for a score or more of years
to check their smoking speed without sue
'cess. They probably did not begin to
make the effort early enough in their
smoking careers. With good tobacco and
a root pipe the slow smoker attains a de
gree of pleasurable enjoyment In smok
ing of which the ra,pid smoker has not an
inkling.
Perhaps all smokers do not know that
It makes no difference In the flavor of
pipe tobarco how many times a pipe goes
out. A cigar which is allowed to go out
ore-, has Us flavor ruined, and is most ap
pioprlately termed a butt. A pipe, how
ever, tastes if anything better for going
out.
Fastidious smokers always have at least
two pipes at hand, and never fill one un
til it has entirely cooled off. This is a
help toward cool smoking and reasonable
life In a pipe. A good test by which tr>
tell if you are smoking too fast Is to hold
the bowl In your hand. If it is too hot to
do so, then you may know that your speed
Is too great. â¢

When the char begins to make the bowl
of the pipe appreciably smaller It should
be cut out. If this is not done the differ

split open. But care must be taken in
cutting away the ch&r not to remove It
all, says the International Magazine.

When breaking In a new pipe It should
be filled with cojd water for a moment or

be repeated for a half dozen or more times
In order that the char shall begin to form

necessary or desirable to dry out the bowl
before filling, but merely turn out the
water. Another point about the treatment
of a new pipe is not to smoke tip all the
tobacco until it Is somewhat seasoned.

our timidity. We fear being . ridiculed,

The expression of the body from heel
to crown helps to tell the story of the
song we sing. Why do we check all this?
For fear we shall be called affected.

The pupil sees ' pictures from beginning

The facial expression, the pose of the
body, must.show a thought. When he has
achieved this he sings artistically Instead
of mechanically. The lack of artistic ex

we do not notice these at first, but by and

If America had a national 'conservatory

attract especial attention, since it is de

point of view. In his preface Professor
Shaler says: "In effect this book is a plea
for an education as regards the place of
the Individual life in the whole of nature
which shall bo consistent with what wo
know of the universe. It is a plea for an
understanding of the relations of the per
son with the realm which Is in the fullest
sense his own; with his fellow beings of
all degrees which are his kinsmen: with
the past and the future. of which he Is an
integral part. It is a protest against the
idea bred of many natural misconcep
tions that a human being Is something
apart from its fellows; that it Is born Into
the world- and dies out of It Into the lone
liness of a supernatural realm. It Is this
sense of isolation which mere than all else
Is the curse of life and the sting of death/'

The Goldej) Fleece.
The large body of readers who prefer
action to analysis will find Amedee
Achard's romance of "The Golden
Fleece" one of absorbing Interest. Events
follow each other so rapidly and are de
rcrlbed with such terse- yet impressive
vigor that the reader's Interest In the
In conclusion. It is safe to predict that
if "The Maid of Maiirn Lane" does not
equal "Jan Vedder's Wife" and a few
others of Mrs. Barr's earlier works It will
not detract from the reputation as a suc
cessful teller of stories which that writer
so justly enjoys. (Publfshed by Dodd,
Mead & Co., New York. Price $1 50.)
The book touches very lightly upon the
political issues of thnt era. 1791 to 1793;
but dwells at much greater length upon
the horrors of the French Revolution and
the bewilderment and disappointment of
the new-born republic of the west at the
frightful crlme3 committed in the dear
name of liberty by the nation which
America had fondly hoped would prove to
be a sister republic In reality as well as
in name.
We will not spoil the expectant reader's
enjoyment ,of the storv by detailing the
trials and tribulations which make their
course of true love anything but a smooth
one; only, promising that the chief-inci
dent which leads to the unhappiness of
the lovers is one that not infrequently
occurs In evcry-day life, and of which
many of our readers have perhaps been
made the victims. This incident, how
ever, is relieved from triteness by the
skill with which tho discovery of the
blunder Is worked Into the plot.
In the story â¢ before us, the maid of
Maiden Lane is an only child of Dr. and
Mrs. Moran. and the hero is a son of the
captain and afterward General Hyde,
who in "The Bow of Orange Ribbon" iig
tirrs as an ardent and warm personal
friend of General Washington.
The hero of that book, John Moran, we
meet here again in the role of a success
ful and dignified physician; and x the he
roine, lovely Ava Willing, is a matron as
sweet, sraclous and lovable as was the
girlish heroine.
The story is a sequel to the one told In
"The Bow of Orange. Ribbon.V a book
which had a great success some few years
ago.
It goes without saying that Amelia E.
Barr's last novel. "The Maid of Maiden
Lane," is a truly delightful romance; and
like all of this writer's- works, which vary
so. much, each from the other, -in style,
character, and if we may borrow the ex
pression, in stage setting; is so vivid in
expression and so historically exact that
the reader in putting down the book feels
as If he had been a denizen of "old" New-
York In the days when Canal street was
a suburb and the Bowery a lane of rose
shaded gardens.
Sunday excursions are the bane of tho
place. Us nearness to London brings the
excursionists down upon it far too fre
quently for the peace/of the literary col
ony. The day after the Incursion of an
excursion the p'aco looks as if a plague
of locusts. had laid v.-aÂ«if tl.e land. Fields
and waysides are denuded of flowers, the
grass everywhere trampclod. trees strip
ped of leaves, the, whole face of the re
gion strewn with rags. torn, finery and
greasy lunch papers. But the hurts still
hang black upon bushes, London's 'Arry

eat. . Should they ever discover their edi

"Breaking the Shackles." by ; Frank
Barrett, author of "A Pet of Rogues." is a
talc of adventure vln London. The author,
in the first two or three chapters, weaves
an impenetrable web . of .circumstantial
evjdcnce. about an Innocent man, who is
sentenced to life imprisonment. The re

Mrs. Roe ha3 made of "Two Little
Street Singers" a story well adapted to
the requirements of children. The littlo
singers are Rita and Jimmy, who pass
for the children of Tonio, with whom they
travel and for J whom they tarn many
pennies by singing and dancing with thelr
tainbourines. Rita's beauty and Jimmy's
manliness win a liomc for the little girl
with a country spinster and her aged
mother. But troubles come thick and
fast to Rita's friend in tho country, and
brave' Jimmy in the city. All the^e tan
gled threads, together wjth tho mystery
of the children's lives, are most happily
straightened out and the genuine pathos
that has been aroused makes the final
happiness all the more appreciated.
AVe hope Mrs. Roe will write more, for
the reason, if for no other, that there Is
such a strong vein of .helpful corpmori
eense running through the book. No
child can road this story without being
quickened in the right direction as well
as entertained. (Published by Lee &

Tyndull came to Husiemere in 1SS7. Dur
ing three years he and hi? wife lived In a
mere shanty while their house was build
ing. In two rooms Mrs. Tyndall. a* Lord's
daughter, did her own work and was hap
py at it. Later the c.ire of the servants
was addod to the greater spaciousness of
Hindhoad House, as Tyndall called h's
new home. Every summer the house was
let while the owner was off to the Con
tinent, his Alpine chalet and his beloved
mountain climbing, just as in his bache
lor days, for he did not marry until he
waÂ«= 56 years old. He was much respected
and lilted by the townspeople. His ap
pearance and manners wore pleasant and
his hand ever open for local improvements
and charities. H*- was evidently a good
son also; at least his father was proud of
him. for the elder Tyndall's gravrstone is
inscribed "Father of Professor Tyndall."
But kind and generous as he was. Pro-
fossor Tyndall resented his grievances.
When he came here the land was rough,
and wild, a brond pxpahsfl of porse and
heather. He would have liked to keep it
so and was bitter against speculators and
the builders of the suburbr.n villa style of
dwellings. His disgust reached its height,
or depth, when, returning from an Alptne
summer, he found a new house upon his
own hilltop, within view of his windows.
It was a pretty little houpe. as artis
tic on a small rcale as his own mansion,
and with equal right to he there. Pro
fessor Tyndall either thought differently
or cared nothing' about his nmighbor'g
rights. He bought a strip of ground close
upon the offending; house purposely to
erect there what may justly be called a
Epite wall. At close view it was a mean
erection of laths and poles stuffed and
covered with heather, an eyesore to the
newcomers. From the Tyndall windows
it was almost Invisible, melting into the
color of th*> heathery hillside as if a part
of itself. Professor Tyndall died while
yet this wall was new. It came down
toon after his death.

Jl In a bulletin soon to be Issued by the
Weather Bureau at Washington on
the. subject of protecting perishable goods
in transportation. A new kind of car in
double lined and has at each end four
galvanized iron cylinders reaching from
the floor to near the top. In summer
these cylinders are filled with ice and salt,
ptarnped down hard, and it is claimed
that a refrigerator vehicle thus equipped
doos not need any renewal of its stock
of ice on a journey clear across the con
tinent.
The remarkable point, however, Is that
the car is iced in winter % just the same for
the purpose of preventing freezing. Ice
Is normally at about 22 degrees Fahren
heit, and it Is very reluctant to give up
any of its temperature. Hence, when it
is zero weather outside the cylinders of
relatively warm ice acts as stoves, help
ing to keep up the thermometer inside.
Another novel device , by which Ice Is
employed for protection against cold con
sists in throwing upon the car when
the weather Is near the zero point a
stream of water, which promptly freezes
and forms a complete coat all over the
vehicle. This prevents radiation of heat
from the car, and bo tends to keep up
the temperature inside. It Is a nlan fre

were endeavoring to oet fire to the castle.
"Already the door leading to the north
wing had been forced and the stentorian
voice of the Baron de Vlromesnil was
heard In the corridor.
"Lady Gertrude stood In mute terror
as her lord, girding on his rapier, strode
forth to meet her angry father. Oh. tho
agony of that moment!
" *At last!" shouted the old Baron, pur

Count's constant companion, leaped with

bore him to earth, where he was literally
torn to pieces before his daughter's eyes.
"Before his frightened followers could
recover they were driven pellmell by tha

screams, succeeded by maniacal laughter,
which was speedily stilled.

those huddled affriehtedly beneath her

resting upon them and smoked far Into
the night.
Now and again our discourse would fall'
upon the great silent wall near us. upon
our left, which held shut up in its granite
bosom matters of such Import.
One night as we leaned over the stone
rail we saw far below a bent and falter
ing figure, carrying something, covered
like a dish or other round enveloped ob
ject, disappear into the doorway which
led to the staircase communicating with
this wing of the building, and shortly
afterward we heard in the corridor outside
my room the stealthy patter of slippered
feet.
booking out,. I perceived Mere Jeanne
ton, % with a lantern, on her way* down
that* part of the corridor which ran at
right angles with our wing a^id along the
mysterious wall.
She seemed disconcerted on being dis
covered and I withdrew hastily.
On peering out soon after again she had
disappeared, and as I had not heard her
returning steps I was at a loss to conjec
ture what had become, of her, Hubert
thought It odd. too. . Â«
While we spoke a distant muffled sound
penetrated' to us, which distinctly caused
our fell of hair to rise and stir.
"Que dlable!" Raid Hubert.
What indeed? A low, bass howl gradu
ally breaking into a falsetto broke upon
our ears, dying away suddenly and re
peated several times. t
Then along the passageway the careful
footsteps were heard again; and we knew
It must be old Jeanneton -returning.
I peered forth again shortly, and there
she ambled lo the .distant corridor, with
an empty dish In her hand.
' Hubert's curiosity had long ago been re
pressed, and mine was restrained by the
laws of decency, so this passed unex
plained. ' i
Hubert stayed longer than usual that
evening with me, and when he had gone
I could not sleep, thinking about that dis
mal sound and listening with sjrained ear
for that stealthy tread.
There was no recurrence of this inci
dent, and although we kept our eyes and
ears open we never got any satisfaction
on the subject of that night's occurrences.
, It wa3 deliciously creepy, off there alone
In that wing, with that great wall of
mystery close at hand and disappearing
beldames coming and going;
Providence had designed a cure for me of
this unreasonable state of mind, for I waÂ«
destined ere long, like Macbeth, to "sur>
full of h â ."Â¦ but I will not anticipate.
Count Torqull, Hubert's aged uncle,
welcomed me to Morlmere and thanked
me for coming.'
"There is so little here, for a large por
tion of the year, to egayer the life of a
growing youth," he said. "and. helas! my
Plate of health Is not such as to make It
possible to revive the ancient diversions
customary In our house."
He smiled feebly as he glanced along
the line of gallants who still ruffled It
from dingj' frame? upon the walte of the
great dining-room.
The Count, I learned, was an utter re
cluse, and this was my onlv glimpse of
him (but one) during, my stay and only
had for courtesy's sake and- his anxiety
to see his nephew's prospective guest
and an American. He seemed prepos
sessed and embraced me affectionately
ana commended me to the goodness of
Huoert and Dr. Longpre.
I feasted for weeks upon the melancholy
grandeur of my surroundings.
The Hubert at my side, the partner of
all his weird joys, was not the Hubert of
Paris school days, but a dream boy, and I
was fain to put my- arm about him as we
passed beneath the stone gargoyles that
gTmned down upon him from turret and
balcony.
There was something threatening In the
atmosphere of the place and although I
shivered deliciously myself, I was moved
to profound pity for the sweet, sad people
of the castle, who for some indefinable
reason needed It. I divined.
I was soon to have my suspicions con
firmed.
Although the country outside was glori
ous I spent my time chiefly In sketching
the treasures of picturesque material
furnished by the venerable pile of me
dlval masonry. it extended around
four side? of a vast court, in the center
of which stood a granite statue oi Boho
mnnd de la Quesnaye, ancestor of I be
Count, a crusader anu valiant man.
ThÂ« prevailing dark gray granite of
which the castle was constructed gave an
indescribably somber effect to the placÂ«*.

tures of an 11 ' kind In that wing of the
castle from foundation to battlement.
Turing to ask Hubert. who was
sketching near me one day, an explana
tion of this singularity of construction, I
perceived that he had been watching me
narrowly. .
"Mon ami." he replied ' "I would will
ingly give you the information you desire,
but I am quite as much In the dark as
yourself concerning the peculiarity In the
architecture to which you allude. . It has
been the source of much speculation to
myself since I came to live at Mortmere
as my uncle's nelr. but I have never been
enlightened.
"The people of a generation ago were
still well nigh as superstitious as in the
mlddfe asres and most of the great
houÂ«"Â»s have some ghostly legend at
tached, some inexplicable oddity, some
canker of the Imagination, manifesting
itself in queer alterations made from age
to age by successive owners."
In the course of . time, growing more
familiar, I gained " the confidence of old
GodKrcl, the concierge or warder, as he
would have been called In olden times.
From him I drew the reluctant story that
In the portion of the castle thus walled off
from the rest, and comprising an entire
wing, had died the xormer adored wife of
the Count. Lady Gertrude de la Quesnaye,
and that after her death that part of the
castle had been cut oft entirely from the
rest, the master being unable to bear any
sight ever again of what was associated
with his lc*st bride. _
More than this I could not learn; there
appeared to be nothing more. Neverthe
less my curiosity burned to see the other
side of that wall.
The apartments allotted to me. consist
ing of a salon and sleeping-room, were
situated In a wing of the castle, which I
jucged from looking up at my window
from the courtyard was situated near the
forbidden ground. I examined the corri
dors i.ear rr.y chambers and found th:it a
scl'.d wall of masonry extended on
through the castle without any apparent
openings anywhere. â¢
Hubert always spent his evenings with
me after dining together in his apart
ments, situated quite at the other end of
a long gallery. Narrow stoned balconies
jutted from the wondows opening on the
couti. ornamented with grotesque heads
and figures, or gargoyles, and we often
The great stuffy old carved bedstead,
with Its 'canopy overhead and pendant
dusty curtains, and all so high from the
floor that I had to climb Into it from a
chair; the paneled wainscoting, the
quaint, big-flowered wall paper, the tiled
floor and great fireplace with brass and
irons were full of the poetry and glamor
of the past.
A large tapestry hung on one s!de, rep
resenting impossible huntsmen perform
ing: impossible feats, accompanied ty
hounds that persisted In looking directly
backward as they ran, as though saying,
"Come on."
Well, 'one evening toward midsummer
as I lay on my bed in pajamas â Hubert
having bid me good-night and gone â I
was awakened suddenly from a light doze
Into which I had fallen by a slight
scratching sound.
My bed was just opposite the tall, pan
eled door.
I listened Intently, but hearing nothing
I was again sinking into a doze when I
was again startled wide awake by an un
mistakable rattle of the brazen doorknob
and a heavy escaping sound, andâ and â
heavy breathing.
Starting bolt upright, I stared at the
door, when my attention was drawn up
ward to the transom, whereâ Jesu have
mercy!â a face, or something resembling
a face, certainly not human, glared down
upon me through the glass with burn
ished, brazen eyeballs.
My tongue was glued to the roof of my
mouth, my throat was dry and the Icy
sweat trickled down me in streamlets.
There was a growl and a rattle, and I
lost consciousness for ever so brief a
spell.
When I recovered, still sitting clutch
ing the bedclothes, stiff with terror, the
face was gone. Gathering myself together
with a mighty effort I took a pull at my
brandy flask. Then I drew my revolver,
from beneath my pillow and. stumbled
Into a chair.
"Pshaw! I was dreaming." I muttered,
but I wasn't In a hurry to open the door
to investigate.
The entire length of the castle sepa
rated me from human aidâ so far that my
husky voice would not be likely to reach.
But as I Jhougnt such uncontrollable
horror grew upon me that I must do
something or die.
Grasping my revolver firmly, I blew out

Tim relations preserved between these
twn were interesting to see.
The bourgeois could never s.ep outslda
his atmosphere; the nobleman out of his;
neither drsired to. Both had received the
Ftamp In the remote beginning of things
and would preserve it until extinct. They
could l!ke or dislike unrestrained.
As a ranklesa American this was an ln
tere?t1r.s study. I was as one apart, be
ing s? y<-t non-committal upon the sub
ject of lif<> and social problems and the
heir of the ages. Yet as au artist and
devotee of beauty I naturally gravitated

I frequently lunched with both then*

Coming of a professional and artistic

his enthusiastic invitation to me to visit

him one fine day in May at the close of
the term at Aeadc-mie Prlntannlere.
We rode in the democratic diligence,
over roads formerly traversed by th9
Quesnaye coach and four, rieoehetting
against one another and a couple cf
pcasoj-.ts. bawling ourselves hoarse, to
Mortmere Castle, the home of the Ques-
Dayes. The road became softer as we left
the high road and the forest deepened a.Â«
we advanced and drew near to the estate.
Hubert had become silent and over his
face had gathered a iook which I coull
rot exactly designate as a cloud, but
which was unlike his usual expression

trtxed by a little steam launch and towed
around to where the raft is being built.
For this reason the construction of the
ways was an Important engineering
achievement itself. If anything should
happen and the huge bulk refuse to glide
down the whole would be a failure, as no
mechanical force could budge It if gravity
failed.
After the ways were completed a great
Â«radle was built like the reverse, or -In-*
tagllo, of a ship. Into this cradle the log*
A log raft when it is ready to slide from
the ways has nearly three times ihe
weight of the, greatest' battleship When In
the same place, for the ship has not re
ceived her armament nor supplies, while
the log rafts have, been estimated to
weigh nearly twenty thousand tons, being
all built of green timber.
It was then decided that a raft must be
built like an ocean feteamer, on ways,
and with a firmly united body which was
so braced as to make . it like one solid
piece. \^
The raft was all right when leaving
shore and for some way out, but when
well in the middle of the Japan cuYrent
which runs on* the coast It was found
that in addition, to the regular shoit
u aves which show on the ocean surface
there were long almost invisible swells
whose crests were nearly the length of the
raft apart. The result was that at times
the ends only of the raft were supported
on these crests and the middle would drop
down slightly. Then the crest of the
sv.cll woiild run along to the middle
and the two ends of the raft would re
ceive less support and they would drop.
In this way the logs were continually
chafed and rubbed against each other un
til the soft green wood was worn away.
Tha size of the legs was thus diminished,
taking the strain off from the binding;
chains and leaving them free to com
mence dropping out. So the whole fell
apart, often carrying away much valuable
chain which, could not be rescued, as the
tugs would not dare to go Into the madly
tossing and grinding sea of timbers.*
The rafts were built still more solidly
and loaded with binding chains drawa
as tight as human ingenuity could accom.
pllsh. Then a careful watch was kept to
see what really happened.
Some years ago, to overcome this dif
ficulty, the first ocean-going raft- wa3
built by attempting to pile logs into .t
solid mass whl!e floating in the water,
the underneath logs sinking as others
were laid above them, all being held ia
place by chains. This structure and all
rlmilariy built went to pieces and their
timbers scattered far and wide over the
water, threatening to demolish the whole
ocean traffic, for a huge log poised on
the top of a great comber is hurled like
a bolt from a catapult and would sink a
email vessel as quickly as would a tor
pedo. â¢
It was at first thought that the captains
of the towing vessels had Intentionally
let the rafts go to pieces, as each raft
would be the means of throwing five or
ten vessels out of employment and in thai
way practically destroy tbe coasting lum-

>oay not have relished the prospect of a

they had too much pride in their skill as
navigators to allow them to lose a single
chance to win laurels.

"romantic time," and have alluded to

used her millions to advantage. I have
passed a number of days In the region
of Blenheim, and have gradually arrived
at the conclusion that It is well worth
while being an Knglish Duchess. In the
first place, the love and respect for the
aristocracy of the country is more sin
cere and mere deeply ground among the
British than perhaps anywhere on the
Continent. The devotion of the English
to old-time traditions and customs is
simply Ineradicable, and respect for the
master, a most unquestioned submission
to the lord, is not the least important of
those sentiments left over from feudal
times. Be what else he may. an English
Duke is none th*Â» less a little sovereign,
and his Duchess is none the less a Cueen.
Marlborough. for Instance, reigns su
preme over a vast country around Oxford,
cess, is not worth while, at least in my
humble estimation. I see small return for
the capital invested. Take Anna Gould,
the Countess de Castellane, \is a fair
sample of the titled American on the
Continent, and you ask yourse'.f what has
fhe gained for all of her. vast expendi
ture. She has a pink and white doll-baby
for a husband who is continually doing
foolish things and keeping himself noto
rious. She is laughed at and criticized by
the French people, who refuse to take hpr
claim to distinction at all seriously: theÂ»
she is s'rnpiy tolerated In ..he society in
which she moves; there Is nothing of th<>
lioness r.or of the leader in her position.
She is not a cueen. She h?Â»s no realm,
no subjects and no particular homage
except that very vulgar homage that can
always be obtained by the vast expendi
ture of money.
Tjt T7 0THING is so exasperating to an
j^^J invalid as to have attendants or
]> it members of the family whispering
Â»bout something or other. The sick
porson is generally In more or less nerv
ous excitement, and, even If It were oth
erwise, nervous excitement would be pro
duced by the whispering.
The mystery of it is irritating. Xo mat
tor how weak or apparently unconscious
the patient may be, in nine cases out of
u-n he is trying to hear what is being said.
A loud whisper. "Do you think he Is go
ir.jr to live?" or even. "Hush; you mustn't
come in here!" is alarming, ar.d lessens
the chance of recovery. Whatever must
bÂ«? said should be in an ordinary tone of
voice. There should be no mystery about
'.In- hickrocm.
Gas l^gs, or pras stove?, are now, for
two reasons, usod much In the sickroom.
Their use involves less noise, and they
tre always ready to light. Care must be
taken, however, that there is no leak in
the connections, for hardly anything is
more insidious in its effect on a sick per
ron than escaping: gas. A vessel of water
viith a larg<) surface should always be
I>!aord near the stove or the hearth where
the log if burring, to moisten the atmos
phere of the apartment. A boiling kettle
'â¢n a gas stove, when the stove is used, is
c-vr-n better.

causes Increased heart action, with a ton
eerjuenl Increased loss of blood. This Is
particularly Important to remember Jn
cases of \,'.ir<ilr.s from the lungs.
When a person faints he should be laid
fiat on his back, find all articles of cloth-
Ing that appear tight should be loosened.
Frerh air shouM be admitted to the room,
Emcllicg salts ci hartshorn should bo ap-
plied to the nostrils,, and the face and
head bathed with cold water. If neither
salts nor hartshorn can be found, a smol
dering rag will often revive the patient
When the person has regained conscious
ness, if the fainting was not accompanied
by bleeding or the result of bleeding, then
a small quantity of brandy or other alco
holic stimulant may be safely adminis
tered
Many .doctors still encourage the use of
the old-fashioned mustard plasters or the
flax pr-ed and bread and milk poultices of
our grandmothers' time. When a mustard
plaster or a hot poultice Is removed, it Is
important to dry the parts quickly and
cover with flannel or cotton wool. This is
to prevent cold from exposure.
The sickroom should be a large and
cheery apartment. The windows must bo
arranged so that the room can be dark
ened when necessary- Often the glare of
too much light in a large room is as de-*
pressing to a patient as the stuffiness of a
small one. Once a day the patient should
be well wrapped up and the room aired,
no matter what the weather may be. Rugs
are better than carpets and a. good mat
ting better than either. Bentwood or wick
er furniture is preferable to that which Is
upholstered.
Every day, if possible, there should be
a change in the general effect produced
by rearranging chairs or by changing the
place of pictures or by hanging new ones.
But the value of this will be lost unless
the changes are made when the patient
Is unconscious of them. Do not always
hare the bed dressed exactly the same.
Change the white counterpane for one
that has some color.

every fourth resident is insane.
The Insane that come to them are not

still he Is much more decent than Is
popularly supjvosed, his crying fault being
a lamentable insignificance. In this re
spect, however, the Duchess Is r.o more
to be pitied than the millions of other
women In the world with insignificant

In this regard! There are nrrt croush

it Is much better that the ir. significant

eo much compensation. It Is surely worth
while being a duchess!
The Duchess Is very beautiful In thÂ»
saddle, which, of course, delights all
English souls. She had never hunted till
after her arrival in England, but Is now
considered an expert by the severest
critics. Most commendable of all. she
has endeared herself to the poor people
for miles around the palace. Every onÂ«
has a kind word for the Duchess. "I tell
you, she's a hangel on hearth." one of tha
gardeners said to me as I watched h!m
transplanting his roses. "My old woman
had been ailln' for many a year, when this
summer the Duchess says to me, 'John.
how's your wife 7* and I says to her. *>Â»ot
very good, your Grace.' She's llmpiri'
about and frettin', just as usual.* 'Would
Fhe like to go to the seaside?* says the
Duchess, and I says quite natural like.
â¢Well, I dare say she would, but it costs
money to go to the seaside, yer Grave.'
'Well.' says the Duchess, 'you tell her to
get ready and go and I'll pay the ex

near have similar j.tories to tell.
The your.gr Duchess of Marlborouga has
made herself very popular amors her
husband's people. She is endowed with
the kind of talent that is appreciated in,
the British aristocracy, simply the abltitv
to do nothing in particular and to do it
gracefully. A positive talent is absolute

Edward, the Black Prince, was born in
this palace: here the Princess Eliza

was a favorite Iiabitation of the Kings
of England up. to tic time of Charles I.
when it was unhappily allowed to decay.
The present palace was erected during the
reign of Queen Anne, and presetted by
her to John. Duke of Marlbororjjh, as
"a testimony of royal favor and rational
gratitude for hi3 services against the
French and the Bavarian?." Parliament
concurred with the Queen in this pre

comphetion of the palace. Readers of

only a faint saccharine smell Is for many
sorts of cake better than either granu
lated or cut loaf, and first class grocers
will supply on demand a light yellow sort
sugar, much better for dark cakes than
any of the white sugar tribe.
Butter speaks for itselfâ to eye and
nose. Eggs carry within the hallmark of
freshness. It Is the air bubble at each
end, betwixt the lining membrane and the
shell. "When the bubble 13 small and lo
cated at the ends the eggs are at least
reasonably fresh; If It has shifted to the
top, or is as bis as your thumb's end.
they are open to suspicion. Eggs are
better broken cool than warm â so In hot
weather It is well to lay them in ice
water, or set them In a refrigerator half
an hour or so before using 1 .
Cake making single handed Is a matter
for method. First measure your butter
and set It where It will soften without oil
ing. Melted butter cannot be creamed,
and creaming is essential to lightness in
the cake. Put it in a bowl big enough
to admit of vigorous stirring. Then meas
ure your flour, sifting It first; put In the.
poda or baking powder and sift again.
Cake flour should always be sifted twice
âif it is measured as It comes out of the
barrel you will get too much of It. If it
feels the least bit dammv. or even If the
day Is damp, set It where It will warm
without scorching, until you are ready for
it.
Next measure your sugar, and be sura
the measure is exact. Sift it and set It
also to warm, but be sure It does not heat.
Now break your eggs and separate yolks
and whites. Break each one over a small
dishâ then Jf you find a bad one, you will
not ruin the whole batch. Put tha yolks
Into the mixing bowl and bo sure- It fa big
enough â It should be twice thÂ© capacity
of the finished batter, to allow for beat
ing. Beat the yolks till they foam and
look almost creamy white, then put in tha
BUgar. a cupful at a time. a.nd beat again.
After i that, cream the butter â really
cream it. Do not be satisfied when it
is soft enough to stir. Keep beating and
stirring It, always the same way until it
drops from the spoon In a frothy rope. Add
it to the eggs and sugar, alternately 'with
the flour, and take care to stir .In every
bit of flour before you put in more butier.
A drop of butter falling upon dry flour
makes a lump it is almost impossible to bo
rid of. When all the butter and flour are
in. beat hard for ten minutes, then go to
work whipping the whites of eggs. Beat
them very stiff, and mix in lightly. Now
ff you have used soda alone, put in your
lemon juice â strained, or your sour cream.
Beat the whole mixture, for three minutes
longer, add your flavoring, also a dash of
rum or brandy, then pour Into molds and
sot in the oven. -\ \l
Here is an excellent quick sponge cake' â
especially good to break, and eat hot. or
serve with sauce as a dessert. Break five
eggs, whites and yolka together, beat them
very light, then add two cups of sifted
sugarâ three cups, scant ones â of twice
sifted flour. Beat smooth, then add a cup
of strictly boiling water, in which you
have dissolved half a level teaspoonful of
baking soda. Stir hard, then follow It with
the strained juice of two lemons, a
teaspoonful of lemon extract, and tho
grated yellow rind of the fruit. Last of all
stir in half a gill of whiskey or brandy.
Bake in a quick oven. This makes a fine
layer cake by baking thin. Spread a layer
still warm with frosting, then strew
chopped nuts, and seeded raisins on the
frosting, and put on another layer. Repeat
until the cake is as high as you like. Let
cool, trim smooth all around and frost
thickly.

of the adventures of the notorious Tibur

LONDON/ Oct.- 13.â No words can
express too strongly the irritation
of the British Foreign Office over
. theV'latest - developments in the
Chinese negotiations, and its hope
lessness of any working arrangement be
ing arrived at in the near future exceeds.
if anything. Its Irritation, the chief cause
of which, to quote an oSlcial, Is the ex
traordinary . and . unreasonable publicity
given diplomatic communications even
before they are officially communicated to
the other powers. â¢" -V
America, according to the view taken
by this official, whose opinion may fairly
be presumed to echo Lord Salisbury's, Is
among the offenders in' this respect.
"How," continued the informant of tho
correspondent, "can we be expected to
arrive at conclusions when the Chinese
are given the opportunity of knowing
every step in tho negotiations, which In
themselves are as intricate as the world
has seen. The advantage which this un
precedented publicity, has given the Chi
nese cannot Â¦ be Â¦ overestimated. It'-ha3
constantly given them 'the opportunity of
creating differences :betweeen the powers
and interpolating "excuses ; arid 'sugges
tions which, if co'ntihued. v, bid "fair to
render Europe and America the laughing
stock of ' the Oriental" world. And this
deluge of> notes'. What do they amount
to? Who for a moment believes China
is going to calmly lay, her head * In the
headsman's basket? For the suggestion
that the court â¢ return to. Peking means
nothing less. The answers to the notes
so far made can be fitly described as an
endless chain of reservations^ which re
quires much, if not more, discussion than
the notes themselves. â¢ Lord - Salisbury
has endeavored to. answer them as. they
came up, but more, I believe, for the sake
of keeping In line than from any convic
tion that 4 they would accomplish any de
sired end."
"Will he step Into the breach and him
self enunciate a line of policy in the hope
of uniting the powers?"
"No, Tdo not. think so. Not at present,
at any rate. Notuntll the present curi
ous policy : of making Peking diplomatic
intercourse a matter of premature public
discussion -comes 'to an end.. If a father
or mother wishes to punish- a, child, but
differ as to the nature of the punishment,

Irritation of British Foreign
Office Over Recent Events.
Stand of UnCle Sam Generally
Approved by Germans.
BERLIN. Oct. 13.â The United
States' answer to the .French note
may be said to be generally ap
proved here, neither the press nor
the Government desiring to af
front France by openly urging objections.
A number of papers express astonishment
at the fact that the United States has so
rapidly reassumed a more energetic tone
toward China, and attribute the change
to Secretary Hay.
The Cologne Volks Zeitung points out
that the United States' "sweeping de
mands," including Prince Tuan's execu
tion, and the* United States' withdrawal
of troops are "contradictory" and explain
able only "by the intricacies of the pres
ent political campaign."
The Lokal Anzelger, discussing the
United States' Presidential campaign, edi
torially says: "Germany "cannot sympa
thize with either McKlnley. or Bryan, as
they both stand for anti-German inter-
Few papers, however, discuss the -.de
tails of the." American political -campaign.'
Private dispatches from' St.' Petersburg
say Prince Tuan has gone into the Interior
of China, where,* "â¢with the consent of- the
insincere " Chinese Government,"; he is
arousing the population to arms against
the foreigners.
Russia, it; is added, believes the best
way to solve the present -problems Is to
humble the Sianfu court and- bring the
Chinese' to' terms. The â¢Imperial* party, it
is pointed out at St. Petersburg, would
thus be-'cut off from "supplies of money
and food stuffs. * Â¦
A military writer, In tho Tageblatt ad
vocates the same method, which a num
ber of papers Indorse. The Lokal An
zÂ«-igrr 'advises the adoption of strong
measures against the Chinese* Emperor.
The Russian suggestion to submit- the
Chinese question to The Hague'arbitra
tion court is ridiculed by the press," with
the exception of the Vorwaerta. (Socialist),
which indorses the plan and'"says: "A just
court would award higher . damages to
China than the allies, who, by their sys
tem of conquest and- exploitation, pro
voked the political rising."
S A Foreign Office official Informed a rep
resentative of the Associated Press who
questioned him regarding The Hague sug
gestion that this plan is impracticable,
since the work of estimating the damages
must be done In China,
Arbitration, he added, would cause great
delay, pointing out that arbitration was
"mÂ«TeIy suggested by Russia."
Government, circles, though the officials
are not willing to say so for publication,
continue to believe the Chinese campaign
will last long, probably for years, unless
Emperor Kv.ang Su is induced to return
to Peking, which is not deemed very
likely. Â¦ -:-
Military circles point out that the se
vere North China winter Is approaching,
when the more Important military opera
tions will be impossible. . _> â¢
The German Foreign Office has no late
news itom Field Marshal Count von Wal
dersee or Dr. Mumm von Schwarzenstein,
the German Minister to China.
Referring to the remarks in the foreign
press that Von Waldersee will not find
eny Americans. Russians or Japanese at
Peking to command, a. Foreign Office of
ficial remarked: "This Is not true of the
Japanese, since they are still in Pechill."

LTnited States*' answer to the French noto
is set forth to-day in the Cologne Gazette
In an article apparently inspired. / In

â¢The answer, as a whole, meets with

spect.

disappeared."
.The' Saxon/ Government has prohibited
the naturalization of Czech .and Polish
immigrants, to prevent" the Slavizatlon of
th,e frontier ' districts toward Bohemia,
whose" mines lately' have attracted crowds
of^lavs.
Regarding the claim for damages, the
Foreign Official said: _ "Germany has
not yet been able to take a definite atti
tude on the subject. Russia's suggestion
Ir. not deHnito enough. It can hardly be
supposed that Russia intends to submit
the claims of Russia and those of the
other powers to the arbitration court.
Probably Russia means pre-eminently
those damages which China must pay to
the missions destroyed by the Boxers and
to private persons Injured In the excesses.

mony among the powers In their endeavor'
to obtain sufficient redress for. the crimes

suggests supplementing the list of the

wishes of the German Government."

MAKE LITTLE OF TJFBISING.
Chinese Officials Think Sun Can Not
Do Much Damage.
CALL BUREAU, WELLINGTON
HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Oct. 13.-^Chl
nese officials here place little confidence
in the reports of an uprising against the
Government, styled the reform move
ment, in the -southern provinces, and
speak of Sun Yat Sen, the leader' of th<Â»
Insurgent!?, as a man of njeager ability.
Minister Wu refuses to believe that tho
uprising Is of any Importance. He says
that If It had strength, while his Gov
ernment might have failed to notify him
of it, his friends in China undoubtedly
would. He places Sun Yat Sen in the
adventurer class and says he is not we'!
thought of by leading Chinese.
Secretary Yung Kwai of the legation t*
personally acquainted with Sun. He
said to-night that when a medical stu
dent in Hongkong. Sun became con
vinced that he was the leader to over
throw the Chinese Government and to,
create reforms. -Here -he gathered around
him a faithful band of sympathizers.
They were going to pull down the rotten
institutions of the Government, but
when they had destroyed them they did
not know what they were going to do.
Plans for a revolution were formed ani
Sun smuggled' arms and ammunition Into
the city. Everything was ready for the
breaking out of . the revolution. The
Chinese officials became aware of the
plans of the reformers and succeeded In
capturing the arms and nearly all of
Sun's principal followers. -Sun, how
ever, succeeded In getting away. , Those
arrested were severely punished.

Reform Association, In discussing the
Hongkong dispatch stating that Sun Yat

REBELLION IN CHINA IS ASSUMING
SERIOUS PROPORTIONS NEAR CANTON
SCRANTOK, Pa.. Oct. 13.â The anthra
cite coal miners now on strike, after a
two days' coxiventlon, late this afternoon
decided to accept the 10 per cent net In
crease In wages offered by the mine own
ers, providing they will continue the pay
ment of the advance until next April and
will abolish the sliding scale. If the op
erators consider the proposition unac
ceptable the miners are willing to arbi
trate the questions at issue. They also
decided to continue the strike until tho
operators agree to the convention's prop
osition. The resolution is as follows:
"We, your committee, respectfully sub
mit the following preamble and resolu
tions for your consideration:
"Whereas, The anthracite coal opera
tors have posted notices offering an ad
vance cf 10 per cent over wages formerly
pattl and have signified their willingness
to adjust grievances with their employes.
"Whereas, They having failed to specify
the length of time this advance would re
main in force and having also failed to
abolish the sliding scale method of deter
mining wages, we would recommend:
"That this convention accept an ad
vance cf 19 per cent, providing 1 . the opera-,
tors will continue Its payment until April
1, 1901, and will abolish the sliding scale
In the Lehigh and Schuylklll regions; the
scale of wages in the two last named dis
tricts to remain stationary at 10 per cent
above the present basis price, and tnat
the companies will agree to adjust other
grievances complained of with commit
tees of their own employes.
"Should this proposition be unacceptable*
to the operators we recommend that the
convention propose that all questions at
Issue be submitted to a fair and impartial
board of arbitration.
"We would further recommend that tin
der no circumstances whatever should
there be a resumption of work at any of
the collieries until the operators signify
their acceptance of this proposition, and
you are notified officially that the strika
Is ended and all return to work In a body,
on the same day."
Judging by the unanimity of tho misers
In accepting the above resolutions, and by
the determined stand taken by the opera
tors, it is generally believed a. long eon
test between the strikers and mine owners
Is not unlikely. There was great enthusi
asm in the convention when the connter
propositlon to the operators was caxiiedi
and three cheers were given for President
Mitchell. The resolutions were drafted
by a committee of. thirteen appointed a;
the morning session, of which, the national
president was chairman.
Mr. MitcTiell in an Interview with a, rep
resentative of the Associated Press on tha
outcome of the convention said:
this rule.
"The action of the delegates in the con
vention to-day in accepting: an advance of
10 per cent, providing they receive assur
ances that the advance will continue in
force until April 1 next year, demon
strates that the miners are considerate off
the public Interests Involved and are dis
posed to be conciliatory, and* yet the
mine-owners refuse to Join hands with
the^mlners in bringing' the strike to a
close. The responsibility for the suffer
ing that It will entail on the poor in tho
large Eastern cities will rest entirely
with the operators. The operators have
now had an opportunity to prove that the
proposition offered by them was mado in
good faith. If they are willing to pay 1)
per cent advance they certainly ought to
continue to pay It for six months. The
mine-workers will all remain on strike
until officially notified by the officers of.
the union th.at the strike is declared at
an end. There will be no exception to
"I cannot understand any good reason,
why the operators should not accept the
conditions named In the miners' resolu
tions. I, of course, hope that there will
be a speedy termination of^this contest,
and I believe that In the future the opera
tors will be disposed to treat with moro
consideration their employes than they
have In the past.
"I am entirely satisfied with the action
taken.by" the miners. They did not de
cide the question with a view of pleasing
me, but took the step because Its satis
fied them. ' It was In their hands and they
showed an extraordinary spirit of fair
ness." , .
Both of to-day's sessions were again
held In secret. At the morning- session
the entire ware scale was discussed in all
ltA "t""'.
Whejj Mr. Mitchell was asked In -what
manner the operators would be notified.
as they do not recognize the Unite i
Mineworkers. he said the employers
would probably flnd it out through the
.newspapers.
Although the Miners Are Ready to
Make Concessions, There Is a
Promise of a Long
Struggle.

IX5TTISYTLLE, Ky.. Oct. 13.â Louisville !
.to-night guvÂ© Governor Roosevelt an on- !
â¢ttcslastlc entertainment, the programme j
concluding with a crowded meeting: at the j
Auditorium. This was in marked con
tradistinction to the greeting offered at '
Ellzabethtown, the last stop before the !
special reached this city. At that place ;
the Governor suffered the first indignity >
Thrust upon him In the State, though In Â¦
eevera! places the audiences were apa- !
thetic. Bowling Green had cheered the I
Governor till his ears rang with the J
i plaudits, and Mumfordville gathered at ]
the train where the speaker's stand wa.Â«
erected, receiving him with expressions of
g-ood will.
Eut at Eiizabethtown It was different.
though the Republicans had done all - in
their power to make the candidate's stop
There a pleasant one. Xo sooner had the i
Governor mounted the platform with Gen
eral Buckner and other members of the
party than an attempt was made to break
up the meeting. Small boys carried
Bryan banners in the outskirts of the
crowd and empty coal wagons were
driven at full Fpeed through the square.
The Ftoam whistle on a mill close by was
blown loudly and a half hundred men or
more shouted "Hurrah for Bryan" when
the Governor began speaking.
Although ho had a soreness of his
throat which had compelled him to short
en all his= earlier speeches during- the day,
the Governor proceeded to make himself
heard in spite of the noise in the crowd.
Above the shriek of the steam whistle j
rang- the wof-ds:
I call your attention to the atti
tude of Mr. Bryan's friends on the i
subject of law and order.
Then he waved his hand to the crowd !
and continued: "It is natural that the
men who have tried to deprive Kentucky )
of a. free ballot should be opposed to. free !
speech. It is not extraordinary that the j
men who have stolen the Governorship
end who seek to Fteal it again should not
dare hear the truth of history, but should,
peek to gag an American citizen even be- \
fore be'^has uttered one word of his opin- j
ions in a political controversy."
This brought cheers and more interrup
tions, and the Governor was urged not to â¢
further endanger his throat, but to per- I
mit a substitute to finish the programme.
He rejected the suggestion, however, and !
ppoke the full fifteen minutes allotted to
him and was escorted to the train by a
large crowd.
"Just a put-up job to break up the meet-
Ing," was Governor Roosevelt's comment
when he returned to his car, "but I guess
I cot back at them."
Chairman Barnett and Secretary Coombs I
of the State Central Committee tele- !
graphed news of the trouble to this city j
and urged local Republican organizations '
to redouble their efforts In showing Gov- Â¦
crnor Roosevelt that Kentuckians are not j
lacking In courtesy and hospitality, and j
when the train reached Louisville It war ;
â¢stormed by an admiring, curious", surging
mob, which followed the party to the
Gait House, where the Governor dined as I
the Â£uest of the State executive commit- i
tee. At 8 o'clock the Governor was es- ]
corted to the Auditorium. The Governor !
tpoke in cart as follows:
"Few things have ever pleased me more
than to speak this day from the platform
on which sits General Buckner, who has
fhown the qualities of soldiership and
statesmanship and of civic manSnen
which we are glad to hoJd up as examples
to our children. He, who fought so va
liantly for what he deemed the right:
who stood up as Governor of this State to

FEW A WAGERS AT WASHINGTON.
Plenty of Republican Money, but
Democrats Are Slow to Take It.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 13.-Electlon bet
ting in Washington up to the present time
is almost a negative quantity. A liberal
estimate of the amount of money placed
up to the present time is $7500, and in
making this aggregate it Is necessary to
count all the small bets made. The pre
vailing odds are three to one on McKin
ley.
Brokers and ethers who are generally
called on to act as stakeholders say that
there Is plenty of Republican money at
three to one, but tho Democrats have as
yet shown no inclination to back their
convictions with cash. A comparison with
four years ago at Shoomaker's, the recog
nized headquarters for bettors, shows that
it may be too early to get an Idea of what
may yet be done In betting before the
election takes place. The books of this
ilrm show that four years ago their first
bet was recorded on October 13 and the
last on October 31. The amount of money
placed was $20,000, and odds were Inva
riably three to one on McKinley. Betting
on the result ln Maryland Is generally a
feature hero. The Democrats are demand
ing ten to seven at the present time, al
thougn even money was placed a short
time ago.
The most notable bet recorded on the
result in Maryland so far Is one of $500
even that McKinley will carry the State
by 15,000 majority.

WILMINGTON, Del.. Oct. 13.-A large
and enthusiastic crowd greeted Adlal E.

this city, where he made a speech In sup

JONES MAKES FULL DENIAL.

Says He Is in No Way Connected
CHICAGO, Oct. 13.â Chairman Jones of
the Democratic National Committee, re

in trusts," said to-day:
"Any statement made by Mr. Roosevelt
that I am In any way interested In any
organization that is in any sense a trust
is absolutely untrue. The charge made
that the American Cotton Bale Company
was a trust was the occasion of a letter
written by me and published at the time
in which I stated the facts of my connec

plains everything and was published and
extensively circulated. If Mr. Roosevelt
had wanted to inform himself he had tho
opportunity of doing so. If he Is a sincere

At the close of the address Colone.
Roosevelt Fpoke In front of the Audito
r;urn, a building with a seating capacity
of 10.000. to a crowd as large as that
Democratic measure, which made it only
a temporary increase. That bill of Sen
ator Cockrell's was supported by the
Democrats and the Populists and the Sll
*~Tt Republicans of the Senate, and but
for that opposition we would to-day have
an army Qf 100,000 nermanently in this
country. But cur people defeated the Re
publican bill and Senator Cockrell's bill
became a law. It was a substitute which
the Republicans had to accept in the Sen
ate. But that substitute expires next year,
and a Republican paper, the Chicago
Tribune, has announced within a week
that Secretary Root would ask the next
Congress to make the army of 100,000 a
permanent army. Now, let the Republi
cans defend their large army. They can
not do it; no Republican will dare* to do
it; and yet if you vote the Republican
ticket you will approve of the army, and
if the Republic&n party wins you will
have an army of 100,000. If a Republican
tries to defend the army, what does he
say? He says we have it because of our
foreign policy.- But there is a domestic
reason, and that domestic reason has its
Influence with the heads of the great syn
dicates of this country. They tell you. If
you will ask them in confidence, that they
want a bigger army for. domestic â¢ pur
poses, to preserve order and to enforce
the law; but the object is to build a fort
near each large city and have an army
present to suppress by force the discon
tent that ought to bÂ« cured by legisla
tion. That is the domestic reason for a
large army."
At Sterling, where a brief stop was
made, Mr. Bryan was introduced to a
gigantic man named Captain Bates, said
to be the largest man in America. Mr.
Bryan said:
"iou are the only man ln this country
that can afford to adopt the theory that
a big man can whip a little man and then
Mr. Bryan arrived In Akron at 8:30 and
began his speech mere than an hour
afterward. The intervening time was
spent In a parade through the streets of
Akron, which was participated in by
clubs from Akron and surrounding cities.
It was stated that 1500 persons had ap
plied for places from Canton and Mas
sillon alone. The line of march was
marked with red fire and the discharge of
other fireworks. Mr. Bryan was driven
to the place of meeting in an open car
riage, drawn by four milk-white horses.
The speaking occurred from a stand
erected on Main street, at the rear of the
Bulchet House. It was impossible to
drive the carriage nearer than 250 feet
of the stand because of the density of the
crowd and it took five minutes "of time
to get him through the throng to the
stand. "When it reached the stand he
faced a multitude of people that filled iJv>
broad thoroughfare on Main street for
two or three blocks and extended Into
the cross streets for Quite a distance.
The demonstration 'was one of the great
est ever seen during the campaign. Mr.
Bryan was in fine voice, but It Is safe to
say that not one-fourth of the people
present were able to follow the speech
because of the immensity of the crowd
and the constant noise and confusion.
When Mr. Bryan arose to speak he was
received with great cheers. He took up
the trust question at the outset ard al
most every sentence of the speech de
voted to this subject was loudly ap
plauded. He said that when suits were
brought to dissolve the trusts there were
generally threats of leaving the town.
"Suppose," he went on, "a man being
prosecuted for horpo-stealing should
threaten to leave the Plate if prosecuted.
"Would you stop the prosecution on that
account?"
He concluded by saying that the law
should be enforced, whether It. affected
large offenders or small ones.
In his discussion of the necessity for the
onforcemont of the anti-trust law, Mr.
Brynn referred to the presence on tho
stand of Mayor Joneg of Toledo and
said:
"Our Mayor here, from Toledo, says
that Is what he wants; the Republican
party Is driving Its best men out of the
party. Jones had to leave the Repub
lican party or rise leave the golden rule,
and he left the party and brought the
rulo with him. Monnett had to leave the
Republican party or else surrender his
convictions on the trust Question, so he
left the Republican party and brought his
convictions with him. And men have
had to leave the Republican party or else
surrender the Declaration of Independ
ence and they have left the party and
brought the declaration with them."*
When Mr. Bryan concluded " Mayor
Jones was introduced and spoke briefly
He was received with wild applause. Mr.
Bryan will remain here until Monday.

BRYAN MAKES MANY SPEECHES
In One of Them He Replies to Boose-
velt as to Increased Army.
AKRON, Ohio. Oct. 13.â A memorable
day ln the Bryan campaign in Ohio closed
hers to-night with a monster meeting, but
large as it was his meeting did not far
surpass several others of the day and it
fell considerably behind the meeting at
Manefleld, which was the last Important
stopping- place before reaching this place.
There were a dozen or more speeches dur
ing the day. the most noteworthy of
which were made at Circlevllle. Lancas
ter, Zanesville, Coshocton and Mansfield.
The crowds appeared to increase gradu
ally in size throughout the day from the
Initial meeting at Chillicothe, a little after
sunrise, until tho last day meeting at
Mansfield, just before sunset. There were
gTC-at crowds at all the places mentioned,
while Mansiield was said to have con
tained twice cs many people as had ever
before been gathered at that place to hear
a political speech. The Democratic man
agement at Mansfield had prevailed upon
neighboring towns to forego their claims
to a speech from Mr. Bryan so as to al
low their people to attend the Mansfield
meeting, and as a consequence the sur
rounding country for a radius of thirty
or forty miles was- well represented at the
Mansneld meeting.
All things considered, the Mansfield
street demonstration was the best that
has Ix-eii made. The stop there was for
an hour and a half and tne si>eaJcing took
place from an elaborately decorateu plat
lorm in front of the courthouse, more
than a mile distant from the railroad sta
tion The esctrtlnt; p*Uty included a num
ber of uniformed clubs both on lout and
en horseback and also a .number of ladles
on floats representing the various States
ol the Union There were a number of
brass bands.
Not only the sidewalks but the entire
streets were iiterally packed with people.
The Ftretts ai-d the public park which ad
joined the meeting place were all crowded,
and the mass ol humanity extended far
beyond the carrying power of Mr. Bryan's
voice.
In his Mansfield speech Mr. Bryan took
cccaFicn to make response to one of the
points in Governor Koosevelt's reply to
one of Mr. iJryan's speeches, but. t>efore
entering upon this reply he discussed the
trust question at considerable length.
After a few words applied to tna army
question in general Mr. Bryan took up
Crtjvernor Roosevelt's rejoinder and said:
"When this campaign first opened the
Republican candidate for Vice President
made a speech at Detroit, ln which he
said: 'Who is afraid of this administra
tion?" He hud four soldiers stand up be
fore the audience and he told the audi
ence that the soldiers bore the same pro
portion to that audience that the stand
ing army of luO.tKXi bore to the population
of the United States. His answer to the
charge that we had a large army was,
'Whose afraid?" but. my friends, that !;Â»
not what he Is saying now. Within a
week that same candidate for Vice Presi
dent, that militant member on the Re
publican ticket, has become frightened
himself, and a few days ago he stated
that WÂ« would not have had that army
but for the war in the Philippines. Why,
they are trying now to explain It or ex
cuse it, when the fact is. and 1 called at
tention to It at once, that the President
asked for the army two months before
there was war in the Philippine Islands
The President asked for the army at the
beginning of December, and war broke
out the 4th of .February, two months af
terward.
"But now there is another defense. As
Foon as the Republican candidate for Vice
President made that defense I saw that
he was in full ro treat on this question and
that the army whs after him. But he, has
made another defence. I find It in this
mornings paper. He says that every In
telligent observer knew that there would
be trouble in the Philippines if the treaty
wa.Â« confirmed. Why Is that possible? If
!t is Dossible that when the President
entered upon his colonial policy he knew
there would be trouble in the Philippine
Islands, what becomes of the argument
that there would be no trouble there if
it were not for the people in this country
who make speeches against Imperialism?
There is the statement of the Republican
candidate for Vice President that two
months; before .the war broke out every
body knew that there would be trouble ln
the Philippine Inlands if the treaty was
ratified. But I want to go a step further
and 1 want to show you that In his retreat
he has become so scared that he has hid
den behind a bill introduced by a Demo
cratic Senator. Let me read you the text:
" "The bill for the temporary Increase
which Mr. Bryan apparently seeks to per
suade his hearers is a permanent increas*
Â¦was introduced by Senator Cockrell of
Missouri, a Democratic supporter of Mr
Bryan, and tbe bulk of the patriotic Dem
ocrats in both houses voted for it."
"My friends, that is a different bill. The
President asked for an armv of 100 000
and a Republican House of Representa
tives passed the bill making the army
100.000. as the President asked, and when
that Republican treaty had been signed
with Spain there was not an arm raised
apainst this nation anywhere. What
was that bill introduced by Senator Cock
rell? It was a substitute for the per
manent army bill. It was the Democratic
prpposltion. which was presented to offset
the proposition made by the Republican
President. I want you to know- that the
Vice Presidential candidate of the Repub
lican ticket, instead of defending the
measure making a permanent increase of
the army to 100,000, tries to hide behind a

LINCOLN, Neb., Oct. 13.â The follow
ing statement over the signature of J. A.
Edgerton, the secretary, was given out
this evening by the People's Party Na
tional Committee:
"Bryan will be elected; he has lost none
of the support he had In 1896 except a few
Silver Republicans - in the mountain
States. Of these there will not be enough
to affect a single electoral vote. He will
hold his own west of the Mississippi, and
will carry every State in that region that
he carried in 1S96, with the possible ex
ception of Wyoming, lie will gain heav
ily in the central West and Kast; he will
not only have all the Democrats and Pop
ulists who supported him in '96, but added
to these he will receive the votes of a
large number of Gold Democrats and
former Republicans who have left their
party on the issues of imperialism and
trusts.
"The following States may be classed as
certain to cast their electoral vote for
Bryan: Alabama 11, Arkansas 8, Colorado
4, Florida 4, Georgia 13, Idaho 3, Louisiana
8, Mississippi 9, .Missouri i7, Montana 3,
Nebraska s. Nevada 3, North Carolina 11.
South Carolina i>, Tennessee 12, Texas 13,
Utah 3, Virginia 12; total 153.
"Added to these are the following
States that will probably cast their votes
for Bryan: Illinois 24, Indiana 15, Kansas
lo, Kentucky 13, Maryland Â», South Da
kota 4, Washington Â¦Â», West Virginia ti;
total 84.
' â¢These added to 153 certain, give 237.
or 13 more than a majority in tne elec
toral college. Outside or. these certain
ana probaole States are the following
doubUul:
"California 9, Connecticut 6, Delaware
3. Michigan 14, Minnesota y, New Jersey
10, New York 3t>, North Dakota 3. Ohio zs.
Wisconsin 12, Wyoming 3; total 12S.
"Of these Minnesota, New York and
Ohio can all be classed as very uncertain
for the Republican candidate; in fact,
were it not that McKinley lives in Ohio,
that State could be considered almost a
certainty for Bryan. â¢
"In lbuS Illinois gave the Republicans a
majority of only a little over 43,0'X', with
practically a break-even in Cook County,
it is now generally conceded that Bryan
will carry Cook County by a good ma
jority. Twenty-two thousand in Chicago
would give Bryan Illinois, provided tno
resÂ»t of the State went as it did in lt>*9S.
But there is every indication that we are
making gains in the country districts,
and that Chicago will give more than this
majority to the Democratic candidate.
"The same conditions which prevail in
Illinois also hold In Indiana, where there
is a much smaller majority to overcome.
"Kansas will go for Bryan by about the
same majority it gave him in 1S96. The
Republicans are making a hard fight for
that State, but they will fail. This is a
Populistic year in Kansas.
"Kentucky and Maryland are practical
ly sure for Bryan.
"In South Dakota our forces are splen
didly organized and are making the best
light ever made in the State. They are
confident of the result.
"In Washington we will win with near
ly the same plurality as we did in 1S9<5.
The conditions which prevail in the west
coast States do not particularly affect
Washington. . .
"In West Virginia we are making gains
constantly. While McKinley carried that
State by over 11.000 in 1896. the Republi
can Congressional candidates only had
about 2500 In 1S98. The same conditions
which will give us Kentucky and Mary
land will also win West Virginia for the
reform candidate." . . . â¢

MRS. C. D. POWELL, OF CHEHALIS, WASH.
Mrs. C. D. Powell, President Epworth League, also President Loyal Temper-
ance Legion, and wife of Dr. C. D. Powell, of Chehalis. Wash., was for several
years afflicted with that peculiar form of chronic catarrh pervading the whole,
system. Involving the stomach, liver and kidneys. It is to this form of catarrh
that Dr. Hartman has for a long time been calling the attention of the medical
profession.- It is known as systemic catarrh. Peruna seems to be the only spe-
clllc for this phase of catarrh yet devised bv the medical profession.
In a recent letter to Dr. Hartman Mrs Powell says:
"I have found Peruna to give satisfaction in cases of indiges-
tion, complication of i.ver and kidney troubles, and it is one of the
finest tonics I know of for a worn-out system. I have used several
renjedies in cases of severe colds and la grippe, but none I consider of
more value than Peruna. I am glad to recommend Peruna to my
friends as a 'reliable, safe and successful specific."
Mrs. Dr. C. D. Powell.
Mr. Samuel A. Sealea, Kimbro. Tenn.,
writes:
"It gives me great pleasure to testify
to the great good your medicine, Peruna,

Many people still thirk that catarrh la
a disease confined tr> the head. This is a
great mistake. Catarrh is liable to occur
wherever there is a mucous mombrane.
Not only does the mucous membrane line
the cavities of the head, nose and thrda:.
but It also lines the stomach, bowels, kid-
neys, bladder and other pelvic organs.
Every duct, every cavity, every passage
of the whole body is subject to chronic
catarrh because they are lined with mu-
cous membrane.

J. A. Barham,
Congressman from California,
When catarrh has pervade! several or-
gans of the body it Is called systetnio
catarrh. It may involve stomach, bowels
and kidneys or liver without disturbing
the cavities of the hf^ad at all. People
who have no catarrh ln the head are apt
to think they do not have catarrh at all.
A preat many people are slowly dyinjr of
catarrh to-day of some of the internal
organs without havlnsr the slightest Idea
that they are vietlms i ,of catarrh.
In order to be fully posted on this sub-
ject every person should read Dr. Hart- 1

First Game of Football in Ten Years
Between the Colleges.
CAMBRIDGE. Mass.. Oct. 13.â Harvard
beat Columbia to-day at football. 24 to 0,
the largest score Harvard has made thla
season. It was the flrsi game in ten
years between the two colleges, and a !
closer sccre was expected. The Columbia !
team came up to their expectations, but
the Harvard team showed weakness
which the coachers had not realized.
Their defense Is much weaker than at
this time last year. Twice In the game
tho Columbia, team seemed able to gain
at will through Lawrence, the veteran
tackle, while the Harvard backs gained
enly through occasional weak playing of
the Columbia linemen. In punting, too.
Kills was Inferior to Mnrley. The only
encouraging part of tho game Â¦was the
way Sawin and Daly eluded the Columbia
ends In receiving kicks and " made long
dodging runs down the field. The game
was fiercely played from the very start.

Taylor, a prominent society woman and
wife of a well-known capitalist, took It
upon herself this afternoon to admin

Professor D. E. Martin, principal of tho
Fourth Street Grammar School of this
city. The professor was mounted on hi-s
horse in the midst of a crowd of several
thousand persons watching the stock pa
rade that was a part of the closing day
of the agricultural street fair when Mrs.
Taylor pushed through the throng toward
him and without warning lashed him with
a horse whip. She struck him once over
the shoulders and a second time on ths
head and face, breaking: the professor's,
glasses. Four lashes In all were given
before Professor Martin was able to push
through the crowd. As he spurred hia
horse Professor Martin turned and tipped
his hat to his assailant. Mrs. Taylor
walked away with the remark:
"I have been waiting for this opportun
ity for a year and a half."
Mrs. Taylor had been driving in her
carriag-e when she caught sight of tha
professor wedged in the crowd. Taking
her buggy whip she dismounted from the
carriage and stepped up to him and be
gan the chastisement. The assault was
made In the presence of her young daugh
ter and her aged father.
To-day's attack is the result of a long
standing fucd between the Taylor family
and the professor. About a year and a
half ag-o Professor Martin whipped John

Bodies of Two El Cajon Brothers
Found on tb-e Desert East of

SAX DIEGO, Oct. 13.â A telephone mes-
sage to the Tribune from Descanso says
that an Indian named Onton Yorba, who

that the unfortunate men were Charles
and Fred Schultz, both residents of El
Cajon.
The Schultz brothers started from their
home for the desert about seven weeks
ago on a prospecting trip. Their time for
returning was indefinite, but they had
taken enough supplies to last them a
month. They went In search of a mine
which the boys said would bring them a
fortune, but instead it is feared they have

LONDON, Oct. 13.â The abundance of

This abundance is . regrettable, for with
the American exchange falling to the gold
point tho Bank of England has already
been obliged to sell Â£300.000 In the United
States and more Is expected to go. Tho
question Is, how high must money be
raised in London to stop the threatened

SAN RAFAEL, Oct. 13.â A baltle took
place late this afternoon at the Chinese
shrimp camp at Point San Pedro, over
100 warlike Mongols engaging in it. Clubs,
stones and hatchets -were the weapons.
The Chinese fought until they were ex
hausted, and a number were badly
wounded. The authorities have been un
able to learn the full extent of the losses
sustained by the factions, as thÂ© Chinese
are endeavoring to conceal the facts.
It is believed here that the cause of the
trouble was the mysterious taking off of
Ah Kim, whose body was found in the
bay several days ago. An Inquest was
held here to-day, and a number of Chi
nese testified that Ah Kim was knocked
out of his boat during a squall. The body
was so far decomposed that it was im
possible to determine how he met his
death. The jury returned a verdict of
accidental death by drowning.
A number of Ah Kim's friends were dis
satisfied with the verdict end this led to
the battle to-day. Wars In which much
blood Is spilled are of frequent occurrence
at the shrimp camps and the local of
vflcers are never called upon by the Chi
nese to interfere. Their wounded are
cared for and concealed, and the "no
sabe" sign is hung out when Inquiries
are made.

From the testimony of Ehlers it appears
that he went to Mr. Witt's place at 4:30
o'clock on July 4. In fifteen minutes he
started for l!r. Thlele's. As he was to
build a barn for that gentleman, his visit
was somewhat lengthy. After his arrival
he drew a plan of the barn and figured
out the amount of lumber required. For
two hours ho remained in the house with
Mr. and Mrs Thlele and Mr. Snyder. A
little before 7 o'clock he and Mr. Thiele
went .to look at the site of the barn. They
were in the yard ahout twenty minutes
and he then left for home, arriving at
<:20. From there he went to Mr. Bruns'
place and spent the evening, going back
to his own house at about 8:45.
With this witness the defense closed its
case. The prosecution called Claude Fox
for the purpose of rebutting tho testimeny
given by the Coroner's Jurors that Mitch
ell had said to Fox in their presence that
n Â« < M Hchell) did not know who shot his
wife. Fox would not swear'that Mitchell
da not make such a statement.
The District Attorney then moved that
the cases of Lemascher and Gayer, who
were charged jointly with Ehlers. be dis
missed, and the two men were released
from custody.
After the testimony had all been put In
District Attorney Bullock submitted the
case without argument, and at 11 o'clock
Jud.?e Buck charged tho Jury. Beforo 12
o'clock Ehlers was discharged.
Ehlers was called to the stand when
court opened this morning and told a
straightforward story of his â¢whereabouts
en July 4. He said he was not at the Im-
Faiid place on that day; that he did not
shoot at Elizabeth Mitchell, and was not
implicated in her murder. The jury be
lieved him and was ready to decide the
action without leaving Its scat.
REDWOOD CITY. Oct. 13.â Caesar
Ehlers was to-day found not guilty of the
murder of Elizabeth Mitchell. There was
no argument over the question and but
one ballot was taken, the jury returning
into court within ten minutes after It had

tion during 1 the past two days may claim
victory, each having- captured an equal
number of prizes, with honors about as
evenly divided as they ever were before
in a similar gathering In this city or
county.
First came the struggle for the chair
manship, wherein the faction headed by
Judge J. W. McKinley defeated that led
by Thomas Hughes, Will A. Harris and
John D. Works. Chairman Lawler made
an Impartial presiding officer.
The McKinley wing added another vic
tory to its credit by forcibly retiring from
the convention the delegation from the
Third Waxd, which had at the precincts
two days ago been voted for early and
often. After these two contests the so*
called "purists" permitted their strength
to go to plecos at a critical period, and
the opposition did most of the scoring
from that time on.

FRESXO, Oct. 13.â Ex-Senator Stephen
M, White was the guest of honor of
Fresno Democrats to-day. He arrived
from Los Angeles on the noon train and
was met at the depot by a committee
composed of prominent members of hid
party. In the evening a band escorted
the ex-Senator to Armory Hall, where h<?
delivered an address to an audience or
1000 persons. Mr. White's "listeners were
very enthusiastic and frequently inter
rupted him with applause. Ths speech
was unexpectedly short, lasting only an
M. K. Harris called the meeting to order
and introduced Sheriff Collins as chair
man. The latter presented ex-Senator
White.
The speaker began by outlining the
early government of the United States
and thp obstacles that had to be over
come by those who conducted it. Since
the Civil War. he said, the growth of the
monetary conspiracy had brought matters
to a state where a contest between the
people and the capitalists was the most
distinguishing feature of American pol
itics.
Mr. White then took up the tariff ques
tion, and, speaking of the tariff on r"resno
raisins, said:
Our Republican friends tell you that if you
vote the Republican ticket you will have all
your local Interests protected. Even your rai
sins will be raised. All you have to do i* to
vote to bring In a Filipino and the price of
iKislns will go up. Xow, whether it be to my
credit or discredit. I have done more toward
Kivlng Fresno what It wanted than the entire
He publican party of the United States. I hap
rened to be a member of the Finance Commit
tee of the Senate, and when I saw that the
manufacturers of knives In Massachusetts an.l
of soap eJsewhere and other Influences were en
gaged In the business of securing protection I
said: "Gentlemen, while we are considered' a
mfre minority In this thing I believe that I
will entertain a Â¦ motion to assist myself. I
propose to take Fresno. California, in"; and.
if I do say it myself. I procured the tariff
that is now upon raisins.
The speaker declared that he had se
cured the tariff against the protest of
every Republican on the committee and
he continued:
Fellow citizens, the fact Is thisâ and I refer
to this more particularly because ft shows you
what results from contests of this character:
It results In a jreneral trade In which one part
of the country pits Itself sjralnst another part
cf the country and nobody In the country gets
exactly what be wants.
Referring to the Philippines Sir. White
asked:
What does the Republican party propose to

Ftreet railway systems, returned to Amer
ica to-day on the steamship Deutschland.
Mr. Yerkes was asked for some details* of
the SSjOOOjOOO Charing 1 Cross underground
railroad franchise which he secured while
in London.
"All 1 care to say has already been
printed," answered Mr. Yerkes. "Of
course, in a way the London deal was
what I might term my masterpiece. I
really can't say when the road will be
comfileKd. Some cf the contracts have
been let, and the work of construction
will l>t promptly begun."

"WTXIi RECOMMEND THE
PAYMENT OF INDEMNITY
President Thinks a Settlement Should
Be Made With the Families of
Four Italians.
Â¦\VASIIINGTOX, Oct. 13.â The President
will recommend to Congress the payment
of an indemnity to the families of the
four Italians who were the victims of a
mob at Tallaluh. La., about two years
ago. A report from a special agent of
the Department of Justice clearly estab
lished the fact that the men were killed
by the mob and that none of the perpe
trators of the crime were ever punished
by the State authorities, notwithstanding
the representations of the National Gov
ernment.
The Governor of Louisiana caused an
Investigation to be made and there were
some proceedings before a Grand Jury,
but the result was that the National Gov
ernment found itself bound to make some
reparation in answer to the Italian Gov
ernment's representations and this will
take the form of an indemnity for each
of the persons killed who were Italian
citizens at the time of their death.
Result of Their Kefusal to Pay the
Indian Tribal Tax, Which They
Consider Unjust.
LEADING MERCHANTS
OF ARDMORE ARRESTED
ARDMORE. I. T.. Oct. 13.â A dozen lead
ing merchants of Ardrri6re were arrested
to-day and their places of business closed
by Captain Ellis and a squad of Indian
police for refusal to pay the Indian tribal
tax. They submitted peacably, but United
States Judge Town.send was immediately
applied to and issued injunctions against
the Indian police, with the result that the
stores were reopened promptly.
The case will be taken to the United
States courts. The merchants consider
this tax unjust, inasmuch as they are now
paying revenue to the city, and they pro
fess to believe that it is a dead letter.
This was the last day given by the Terri
tory officers to comply with the law.

Failure of Bond Brokers.
NEW YORK, Oct. 13.-Gk;orge M. Old
stead and Charles H. Taylor, composing
the firm of Oldetead & Taylor, dealers In
Investment securities, stocks and bonds,
made an assignment to-day without pref
erertce. J. H. Caldwell, attorney for the
firm, said the members of the firm had
not been in business long and neither was
a member of an exchange. They had not
done a large amount of business and the
total of their obligations would not ex
ceed $40,000 or $50,000, due, to customers for
whom they dealt. The assets, Mr. Caldwell
said, might realize about $20,000.
GEORGETOWN. Ky.. Oct. 13.â When
court convened this morning the case of
the commonwealth against Henry Yout
sey was called. Colontl Crawford said he
would like to tile the affidavit of two
physicians or else have them examined in
open court as to Youtsey's condition. He
stated that Youtsey was still unable to
confer or talk with his attorneys about
the case, and he wanted the trial post
poned until Monday. He asked and was
granted until lir.CO to have the physicians
suninoned, and the commonwealth asked
that George Robinson, Wallace Harper
and' Burt Urannock. who have acted v as
guards. for Youtsey. be also summoned to
testify as to Y'outsey's condition.
At the afternoon session Dr. Carrick
testified under oath that Youtsey's brain
is partially paralyzed; that he could not
talk or entertain ideas; that it was a case
of mental breakdown or nervous prostra
tion. The commonwealth cross-ques
tioned him on the idea that Youtsey .was
shamming, and Dr. Carrick said that if
Youts<_-y was, he <Carrick> as a physician
could not detect it.
Dr. J. A. Lewis, who has seen Youtsey
several times since his collapse, said
Youtsey was in a semi-conscious state
whenever he- saw him. and he could get no
response to his questions. He said it
might be several days before Y'outsey
would regain consciousness, and if he did
regain it and then be subjected to the ex
citement of the trial it might bring on an
other attack. He said his physical con
dition seemed normal, except that his
pulse was HO and his eyes crossed, with
the pupils contracted slightly.
Dr. D. B. Knox. who had examined
Toutsey oftenor than Dr. Lewis, corrobo
rated Drs. Lewis and Carrick.
Judge Canirill. deciding to continue the
case until Monday, said Youtsey had not
had a fair chance to recover, as there
had been too much noise and confusion
in his room, and directed the doctors to
keep everybody out of the room except
the nurses and guards.
Physicians Say That While His Body
Is in Good Condition His
Brain Is Partially
Paralyzed.

Disease.
Peculiar Ideas Begirding a Common
Mark Tvrain's cure for a cold In the
head was simple, but he claims very ef-
fective In his own case. His plan was to
eat nothing whatever for twenty-four
hours or presumably until the trouble had
disappeared.
Although not able to speak from per-
conal experience as to the effectiveness of
this treatment, it certainly has the merit
cf extreme economy; but it occurs* to us
that the application of it to a case of
nasal catarrh might be attended with dif-
ficulties
Catarrh, as every one knows, is a
chronic cold in the head, and Mr. Twain's
treatment, if it should become a fad.
would make of us a nation of f asters; an
army, emulating the example of the Im-
mortal Tanner, who achieved world-wide
lame by lasting forty days.
Catarrh is certainly oecoming a national
disease, and there is little doubt but that
errors in diet, particularly overeating, is
a. very common cause.
Most people, however, are more inter-
ested in the cure of the trouble than in
the cause, and modern medical science
has produced more effective and less
heroic remedies than Mr. Twain's. rt
Guaiacol is a new remedy, very effective
In some forms of catarrh. Eucalyptol is
another, which on account of its anti-
septic properties is very valuable, while
many severe cases of Chronic Catarrh
have been entirely cured by the sanguin-
aria or extract of blood root alone.
\Vithin a year an enterprising chemist
ha6 combined all of these remedies in
tablet form, palatable and convenient, and
the superiority of this tablet over other
catarrh remedies is so apparent that all
druggists now carry them In stock to sup-
i<iy the popular demand.
They are called Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets, and it Is doubtful if any medicine
has achieved a national popularity In so
ehort a time as this.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are used by
thousands of traveling men because they
can be carried In the pocket and used
any time and In any quantity, being free
ffrom cocaine, opiate or any poisonous
drug.
They dear the h*>ad and throat from the
disgusting secretions of catarrh, very
often in a few hours' time.
For nasal catarrh they are far superior
to any v.uj-h. lotion or ointment, the use
of which is often as inconvenient and an-
noying as the disease Itself.
For coughs, colds, bronchial catarrh and
catarrh of the stomach these tablets give
Immediate relief and a permanent cure
where lotions, douches and inhalers make
no Impression â¢whatever.
This preparation is a boon to catarrh
Fufrer^rs, and any drupjrlst will tell you
that Stuart's Catarrh Tablets is a remedy
Viat has come to stay.

Says ex-Senator M. C. Butler, a South
Carolina Democrat of the old school:
"I am an expansionist. I think the
Democratic party made a mistake when
they raised the cry of anti-imperialUm
and I don't believe that there ls any such
thing. As for the Southern people I don't
see how any of them, especially those in
the cotton business, can see anvthinir not
beneficial to them in the policy of ex
pansion. I think Mr. McKinley has made
a moat excellent President He ls thor
oughly conscientious, Intensely patriotic
and has the best interests of tha country
North and South, at heart."

The secret is out at last; Bryan has been holding
a card up his sleeve. lie has so little hope of winning
the Presidency that he is inducing his friends to shake
a toga out for him from Nebraska,
The English must intend to make a lifelike model

owned have brought large prices at a London auction.

The Hall of Justice has won its first Tame. In the

had looked out of their windows they could have seen
the malefactors at their trade.
To illustrate. Everybody who knows
anything nbout the modern stage knows
that William Archer is the first dramatic
critic irt Kngland, if not in Europe. To
my thinking he is a better critic than
even those distinguished Frenchmen Fa
guet and Lemaitre. for his knowledge
seems wider and his Judgments are more
cathol'c. He Is thoroughly acquainted
with the best that has been accomplished
in the dramas ol Greece. Rome, Italy.
England , France. Germany, Norway and
Spain; he has seen all the great European
actors for the last twenty-five years; he
can analyze situation and character with
a skill far beyond anything attained by
the best of his predecessors â Hazlitt,
Lamb and Lewes. Ha Is the last man In
the world you would expect to make a
mistake concerning any play he had seen
or read or to print contradictory judg
ments. Yet even Mr. Archer la fallibleâ
or, to put it perhaps more correctly, he Is
unconsciously changing opinions, growing
intellectually after an age at which most
If the tailor may be retailored, there is
no reason -why the critic should not be
criticized. Upon him, as well as upon
every other man who has written (and
forgotten) much, the deadly parallel may
be drawn with amusing effect. Nor should
he be irritated thereby; "to err is human,
to forgive divine," and a man should
surely be pleased when opportunity is of
fered him to exercise the deeds of mercy.
Richard Mansfield: the Original Adapter,
the late Ausustin Daly; the French Fancy
Groceryinan, M. Rostand. Mr. Mansfield
as he was careful to proclaim at the time,
promised to pay M. Rcstand for the priv
ilege of playing * Cyrano de Bergerac."
He now refuses to do eo on the ground
that Daly could not be compelled to pay
royalties, and that therefore he, Mans
field, should not be so compelled.
It looks as if Mr. Mansfield's morals
were becoming perverted by his Intense
desire to conform himself in all respects
to the character of that swash-buckling

There are many similar omissions which almost
every one will note. In short, the result of the voting
shows that the "eminent authority" is very often less
fitted to pass judgment upon matters of common in-
A list compiled as that has been is entitled to re
spect, but nevertheless it will give rise to a good deal
cf 'peculation concerning the principle on which it
was made up. Every man on the list is eminent, but
a good many of them are not "famous" in the ordin
ary meaning of the phrase. Their names are honored
in various professions, but they have not been
sounded into the ears of all by the great trump of
fame and are not familiar in men's mouths as house
hold words. Consequently it would appear the judges
selected men who ought to be famous rather than men
who are famous.
The average American will note with surprise that
Andrew Jackson, whose name has been one to con
jure with in politics for more than fifty years, whose
victory at New Orleans is annually celebrated by a
considerable number of persons, and whose example
is cited to-day in all parts of the Union, is not included
in the list of thirty-one foremost Americans. With
an equal surprise the a\'erage man will note the ab
sence of Monroe's name and that of John C. Calhoun.
Men differ concerning the policies for which these
three men stand, and there may be doubts concerning
their intellectual or moral greatness, but no one can
deny that they are more famous than a good man)'
on the selected list.
It appears that only nirirty-seren'but of the one
hundred voted. The !ht with the number of votes
given for each stands in thh order: George Wash
irgton, 97 (full vote): Abraham Lincoln. o/5; Daniel
Webster, <f>; Benjamin Franklin, 94; U. S. Grant,
92; John Marshall, 91; Thomas Jefferson, 90; Ralph
W2M0 Emerson, 86; Henry W. Longfellow, 84; Rob
ert Fulton, 84; Washington Irving, 82; Jonathan Ed
wards, 82; David G. Farragut, 79; Samuel F. B.
Morse, 79; Henry Clay, 74; George Peabody, 72;
Nathaniel Hawthorne. 72; Robert E. Lee, 69; Peter

John James Audubon, 57; Elias He we, 53; William.
Morris Hunt, 52; Gilbert Stuart, 52; Asa Gray, 51.
The selection has been carefully made. In the fir.-t
place one hundred men were invited to submit names
to the University Senate. These one hundred in
cluded twenty-five Judges of Supreme Court*., national
and State; twenty-five educator*, twenty-fire h\t
torizns or scientists, end ttrentjr-fire chosen from
among the editors and authors of the country, Ko
ru.me was placed upon the Hit of c*A%iLlt\ for the hais
unless it received fifty-one votes. Ths *â¬naic can
vzs?ed the returns ar.d made the selection r>f the
thirty-one, none of the other* bavins? received the
requisite number.
AFTER much deliberation the senate of the
University of New York has made up a list of
thirty-one illustrious Americans whose names
are to be inscribed upon the stately Hall of Fame that
i 9 to adorn the university grounds and be one of the
imposing monumental structures of the country. As
the full number of names to be inscribed at once upon
the hall is fifty, there remain nineteen more to be
chosen. Consequently the list given out is incom
plete, but none the less it is interesting as an illustra
tion of the judgment of eminent authorities upon the
relative rank of our great men.
THE Hf^LL OF FflME NOTABLES.
CAMJLLE D'ARVILLE (MRS. CRELLIX). A NOTABLE EXAMPLE OF
THE TENDENCY OF THE TIMES TO DRIVE THE BEST DRAMATIC
TALENT TO ACCEPT FABULOUS SALARIES IN VAUDEVILLE.
So far as the election goes Bryan's speeches of that
kind hurt himself more than anybody else, but for the
sake of the reputation he has acquired in American
politics it is to be regretted that he has shown so
much of weakness and of spite. A man who aspires
to be President of the United States should at least
have enough of manhood about him to bear defeat
with dignity and not go down railing like a fool.
Such a speech from a man who holds the high posi
tion of candidate of ore of the great parties of the
country for the Presidency can signify nothing else
than a complete intellectual collapse. It is a wild de
nunciation which can have emanated only from the
ntadncss of disappointed ambition. Bryan is seeking
some method of explaining to his followers the cause
of the coming disaster. He is not big enough to
recognize that his defeat is due to the common sense
of the American people. He prefers to attribute it
to bribery, intimidation and to corruption. He would
have his deluded supporters believe that the result of
Presidential elections in this great country can be de
termined by such base means as those he has de
scribed.
BRYAN has evidently learned at last that his
leadership is one of forlorn hope, and that the
end of his political power and prestige is at
hand. He has been cheering his followers with large
words of hope for four years, bu: now he has begun
to utter words that sound very much like a cry of de
spair. He has once or twice of late admitted that
defeat is starfng him in the face, and has endeavored
to break the force of the truth by accusing his oppo
nents of foul plav.
In a recent speech he said: "If the election wer:
held to-day there is v.o doubt we would have a ma
jority in the electoral college and in the popular
vote. But the Republican managers are now collect
ing from the monopolies a large campaign fund.
They will buy every vote that can be bought. They
will coerce every vote that can be coerced. .-They will
intimidate every laboring man who can be intimi
dated. They will bribe every election judge that can
be bribed. They will corrupt every count that can he
corrupted.'' .
THE CRY OF DESPAIR.
That is the way Assemblyman Cotpcr was judged
by those who knew him. The people of Kings
County can draw their own conclusions as to whether
Cosper Is fit to hold a position on their bench.
I said to him. "Well. MJlt. a!n't you making a money
fight on this proposition?" cud hÂ»r raid "No." "Well." I
goid. "I didn't know, but if you wire, perhapti you miVht
offer Ooeper five or six tboasasd dollars, and he would
see it your way."

ported that Mr. Co-pcr had tipeo offrr<^l JCOOO to vote for
TJurnn. and that pcrhars he was waiting for a si:n!la*
offer from us.
We have, however, other objections to Cosper.
The Echo is wrong Â£n Â«aying he "voted once for
Burns." He voted for Burns fourteen times. More
cver, liis conduct was suspicious in many ways.
Here are t~*-o extracts from testimony given before
the committee of investigation of the charges against
Speaker Wright:
ff that be the best defence that, can be made for
Copper, and if the insinuation cf the Echo be correct,
then a new objection eppears to Cosper's candidacy.
A man v.ho in the Assembly would permit the Gov
ernor to coerce his vote for an evil candidate, by
threatening to veto a jest bill, will not have much in
dependence on the bench. It vr.ll be a* easy to in
fluence his decisions a; to inf.ucr.ee his vote.
Of that sheving we have only to say it injures â or
2t least asperses â the character of the Governor, but
does not help Cosper. If it be true that Governor
Gage was so intense a supporter of Burns that he
v.ou'd not sign a bill in which the people of Kings
County were interested unless the Assemblyman
f'om that county voted for Burns then the Governor
should have been impeached. A grosser violation of
official duty it would be difficult to conceive. It is
bed er.ough for a Governor to uÂ«e the patronasre of
the State to support a personal favorite for the Unite i
States Senate^ but if in addition to that offense he go
to far 35 to threaten to veto measures in the interest
of the public in order to compel the representative; of
the people to do his will, then he passet the limit of
toleration ar.d should Le removed from office.
We have too much respect for the Echo to rest
T.:".:^g;y under its condemnation. We desire its ap
proval, and therefore undertake to vindicate our
course. That v.e may do this with all fairness we pre
fcr.t th,e Echo's statement in defense of Cosper's con
duct in the Senatorial contest. It says: "Mr. Co*
jx.r represented Kings County in the Assembly. He
voted once for liurns â presumably to secure the Gov
ernor's signature to a bill in which Kings County peo
ple 7/ere especially interested â and at the extra session
he ftll in enthusiastically for Bard and helped to elect
him. Knowing all these things, a large convention ol
K:ngs County Republicans nominated him for Jud?-.
It is not The Call's 'put in' and :t shuuM not en
deavor to keep alive the Senatorial animosities."
OUR esteemed contemporary, the Bakcrsfkld
Echo, has ccme to the defense of E. T. Cos
ptr, the discredited Assemblyman who, after
offending his constituents by voting for Bums in the
Senatorial contest, is now trying to obtain election
to the responsible position of Superior Judge in
K:r.gs County. It intimates that the course of The
Ca'l in opposing the election of Cosper is d^t to a
vir.cictivc spirit, and says, "The Ca'l is in bad bu;L
cess."
THE OBJECTION TO COSPER.
Mr. Bierce's fables need no Interpreta
tive comment, l>ut I fear that mine do, for
I am a clumsy hand at this kind of writ
ing compared with him. Let me say, then,
that the Well Advertised Intelligence is
It fell upon a Day in the nipping Month
of Frosts that a "Well Advertised Intelli
gence walked into the store of a French
Fancy Groceryman and bought a box of
Dainty Chips. For this he agreed to pay
Two Dollars in installments of Ten Cents
twr day. He had Paid but Thirty Cents
when an Original Adapter broke into the
shop of tbe Fancy Groceryman and
Adopted to himselfâ Conroy the Wise call
itâ another box of Dainty Chips, exactly
like the First. For this he was Promptly
Haled before an Incorruptible Magis
trate (Public Opinion), where he was pro
nounced Guilty, but sentenced Innocent
by the aid of Tu Quoque and a Legal
Technicality. Hearing: of this, the "Well
Advertised Intelligence Refused to pay
the Fancy Groceryman the Jl 70 he still
owed him, claiming that since the Original
Adapter could not be Compelled to pay for
Hfrs Dainty Chips, neither should He, the
said Well Advertised Intelligence, be
Compelled to pay for His chips, although
he had Distinctly Promised (in writing)
so to do. The French Fancy Groceryman
thereupon brought an Action against the
VÂ»'ell Advertised Intelligence, but was
promptly Non-Suited, the court holding
that though he Might have a Casus Belli
he could not have a Casus Aequltatls, be
cause he was a Foreigner.

A DRAMATIC FABLE.
fWIth apologies to Mr. Bierce.)
It has long beer, known that some of
the ancient Greek philosophers made good
cuesses at the doctrine of evolution, and
that Lucretius held a truly scientific con
ception of the atomic theory- But it^has
been reserved for the author (or is it the
adapter?) of "Quo Vadis" to reveal to a
v.ondering world that the Romans of the
first century A. D. had a thorough com
prehension of the properties of the X
ray. â¢ â¢ â¢ I was a little late on the j
opening night of the Nero travesty, and
as I entered the theater the first words
that struck my astonished ear were these,
spoken by Viniciua in his description of
I.ygia: "O Petronlu?. I first saw her by
the light of the setting sun, whose rays |
shone clear through her transparent i
body." I quote from memory and am !
subject to verbal correction, but I am
sure that this vas the thought.
Unhappy Romans of 64 A. D., not to
know that, you knew all this:
a like migration. Two or three years ago
there were two ladles In the United States
who had every qualification necessary for
sustaining the most difficult roles la the
best comic operas ever written. I refer,
of.cours*. to Mrs. Jessie Baxtleti Davis
and Miss Cainillfc d'Arville. Both of these
ladles have now abandoned a form of art
that once called for the highest powers of
a Judic and an Almee, but for which there
Is now no real demand.
To quarrel with public taste Is futile;
yet surely one may be allowed to regret
the passing away of a kind of entertain
ment that combined the intellectual de
lights of comedy with the Eensuous de
lights of musicâ an entertainment free
from the dreary absurdities of grand op
era and the cheap vulgarities of extrava
ganza. One may and should regret also,
I venture to think, the unfltness of things
that condemns Miss d'ArvlUe. for in
stance, to be singing coon songs when ehe
roleht be interpreting for us roles that
ca'.I for all that intelligence and dramatic
power with v.-hich nature has so richly
dowered her. Of the richness of that power
one may still catch glimpses, for It breaks
out even through the dull medium with
which Â»he is now obliged to encase it; a
silly ballad is enacted by her into an im
rassloned love episode, that thrills you as
men were thrilled when Trilby sang "Au
Clalr de la Lune."
Of course the trolley system is a growing one. It
is destined to expand rapidjy in all thickly settled
parts of the country, and eventually there will be long
distance lines making rapid runs without stopping at
every crossing. Moreover, in the course of time, it
will be found profitable to combine various lines into
one general system, as was done with the old railway
lines, but even then the prosnects of their equaling
steam cars is very remote. We must be content for
some time yet with the smoking locomotive.
In reviewing the trip a writer notes that the party
that set out from Boston was not able to make the
entire journey by trolleys. They found four gaps in
the road; three they had to cross by railway trains
and one by carriages. In the course of the journey
they traveled on twenty-three different trolley lines, a
fact which shows that "combinations" have not yet
been formed in the trolley system. The whole of the
first day was occupied in going from Boston to
Springfield, the second day was employed in making
the run from Springfield to New Haven, and the
third day was required to complete the journey.
Of course the test was not a fair one in some ra
spects. The steam cars traversed a track designed
for the purpose of rapid transit between the two cities,
while the trolley cars ran along tracks designed for
suburban trave] only and which therefore do not con
stitute anything like a direct route. None the less ths
difference between the two systems is so great that it
is not all iikely we shall see at any time within a
mcasureable future an electric car system to take the
place of steam cars for any great distance.
The results must have been disappointing to all who
hx:ve had sanguine expectations of seeing steam cars
superseded by electricity for extended journeys in the
rear future. The trolley system is perhaps more fully
developed between New York and Boston than over
any similar area in the world. What has been accom
plished in th.2t section is therefore about the best thai
car. be done anywheie. Yet the trolleys there are
far from offering any suggestion of rivalry to the
railways. A passenger by steam cars can go from
Boston to Ne-.v York in six hours. The recent
pleasure-seekers were on the road three days, having
h.2d to spend the two intervening nights in hotels.
Counting only the time they were making headway
they were sixty hours en the road.
TROLLEY LINES VS. RAILROADS.
AMONG the recent ne-srs items that would prob
ably have attracted a good deai of public at
tention had it not been for the uproar 6f ths
political campaign was one recording the trip of a
number of pieasure-stekers from Boston to New York
by trolley lines. We have heard so much about the
extension of electric lines through the thickly settled
country berween the tvro cities that a good deal of in
ttrest would have been taken in this elaborate test of
their availability for long distance traveling.

THE PASSING OF COMIC OPERA AND OTHER MATERS THEATRICAL.
BY L. DU PONT SYLE.
From whatever point the subject be viewed it pre
Â¦ sents more objectionable than attractive features. The
Â¦ ; proposed courts are unnecessary; they will be costly;
they will disturb the existing order of things and give
| rise to a scramble for the appointments which will al
j most certainly result in grave scandals. The people
should keep the scheme in mind and vote it down.
To. intelligent men it is hardly necessary to point
out that if the Governor be granted authority to name
cine Judges there will be strong pressure put upon
him to select men who will be agreeable to the rail
road or other corrupt powers in the State. Nor can
there be any doubt that the Judges thus appointed will
have an advantageous position from which to seek a
nomination from party conventions when the time
comes for the people to elect. We shall thus have an
evil influence exerted to get the appointments made,
and then a second exertion of the same malign fo-ce
to continue the appointees in ofnee.
In addition to the confusion the proposed courts
Â¦will bring- into the judicial system of the State, and the
increased taxation that will be necessary to support
them, there remains a further objection to the scheme.
Under the terms of the amendment the Judges are to
be appointed in the first instance by the Governor.
Thai feature of the plan is directly antagonistic to the
spirit of the people and the established system of
choosing Judges. It is the will and the custom of
Califomiaos to elect Judges by popular vote. We
have been electing Judges for years, and there is no
discontent with the practice. Why then, if we are to
have three new courts and nine new Judges, should
their selection be vested in the Governor?
Each of the proposed appellate courts is to consist
of three Judges, making nine in all; each will have a!i
the ofneers usual to such tribunals; each will have its
array of clerks, stenographers and other ernp!oyes oi
the kind, and all of these will have to be provided
with salaries Â£t the expense of the taxpayers. Why
should that additional burden be imposed upon the
people? What public purpose will the new courts
serve so beneficial as to compensate for the cost of
their maintenance? Why should xz increase taxes
merely to pay for something we do net need?
Amendments are designed to improve existing con
ditions. The proposed scheme does not amend in
the true sense of. the word. It mere';y alters the order
th2t row exists, and the alteration, so far from being
beneficial, w:ll be positively hurtful.
' determined by their ballots. One of the issues
J stands out distinct from the rest by the fact that from
' firit to last it has found hardly a single open and pub
he defender â not one of any eminence that we can re
; call. The issue having that bad distinction is the pro
posed amendment to the State constitution providing
for the reorganization of the Supreme Court and the
: creation of three appellate courts with jurisdiction in
; termedialÂ£ between the Superior courts and the su
preme tribunal.
The :act that it nzs found no strong sepport at any
" time since it was brought fonrard is itself an evidence
'. of the essential weakness of the measure. Howerer,
' its condemnation does not depend upon negative evi
dence orJy. The scheme is harmful to the best inter
: ests ci our judicial system, and for a time at least will
ccuse a serious disturbance to our judicial machinery,
resulting in more or less confusion and entailing a
considerable increase of litigation until ai! questions
! concerning the scope of the new courts have been de
' termined by decision of the Supreme Court.
THE APPELLATE COURT SCHEME.
WE are drawing near the esd of the campaign.
Since it began there has been ample time for
a presentation to the people of every issue to be

chosen is an honorable one, and the American people

doned Its claim that the Vatican Is an im

old of the Vatican, within the precincts
of which the Pope is supreme In temporal

Should any anarchist be captured

to hand him ever to the Italian police, as
the pontifical courts, although- organized,
have never attempted to try criminal
cases since 1870, and could inflict no sen
tence entailing death or deprival of Jlb

an admission of authority of the Italian

NEW YORK, Oct. 13.â A special to the
Journal from Rome says: Consternation
prevails at tha Vatican, owing to warn
ings which have been received by means
of anonymous letters and through the po
lice, according to which Leo XIII is to be
the next victim of the anarchists, whose
avowed object In assassination is not so
much to avenge Â¦wrongs as to strike terror
and consternation by the choice of the
personage murdered,
The burglary perpetrated last week In
the Pope's private apartments, where his
safe was "cracked" In the most approved
and up-to-date fashion during bis ab
sence, by burglars using American tools,
fcliowa that existing: safeguards are alto
gether inadequate for the protection of
the Holy Father,
It is in consequence of this that the
Vatican authorities have, for the first
time since 1S70 Invoked the assistance of
the Italian Government and have Invited
the old and trusted Police Commissary In
charge of .that district of Roma known
as the Leonine City to co-operate with
them ' In measures for increased security
of the venerable Pontiff,
This peril to which the Holy Father Is
exposed seems therefore destined to bring
about that which all previous negotiations
and statecraft have been Insufficient to
accomplish, namely, an understanding
between the church and state. For, by

while the opposition has elected 258. The
gains and losses now exactly balance,
making the respective strength of the
parties the same as it was at the dissolu
tion, which result Is not likely to be ma
terially changed by the returns from the
thirteen constituencies, where the results
are not known.
The most interesting result to-day was
at Newmarket, where Colonel Harry Mc-
Calmont (the well-known sportsman and
former owner of the fine steam yacht Gi
ralda), who is fighting in South Africa,
defeated Charles E>ay Rose, who was at
one time a prospective challenger for the
America's cup with a yacnt to be named
the Distant Shore, and who is now in
South Africa visiting the graves of his
two sons, killed during the war.

Rally at St. Joseph.
ST. JOSEPH, Mo.. Oct. 13.â Governor L,.
M. Shaw of Iowa was the principal speak
er here to-night in a big Republican rally

phases of the political issues, speaking for
more than two hours. He laid special
stress on the prosperous condition of
American finances, loaning money, as we

conditions five years ago, when the Gov
ernment was a borrower.

CHICAGO, Oct. 13.â During a political

tically that his efforts were largely re
sponsible for the concessions made to the
men by the coal mine operators.

THE SA1ST FRANCISCO CAXiL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 34, 1900.

MAY BE APPOINTED
EM3AS&AJX)R TO ITALY
NEW YORK, Oct. 13.â It Is to be an in
ternational race to the north pole. On two
sides of the globe preparations axe now
being made for the dash farthest north,
and if American pluck, enterprise, energy
and money can do it the stars and stripes
will be carried to the highest latitude yet
attained by man.
Lieutenant Kotert E. Peary, carrying
the American colors, is still in the frozen
north, where he has been for two years.
Without waiting for his return or to learn
what he has accomplished Evelyn B.
Baldwin, an explorer, and William Zieg
ier, a New York millionaire, are titling up
an expedition which they declare will sur
pass in point of equipment, number oi men
and resources all ot its predecessors anÂ»l
which they say will reach the pole if it
is within the range of human possibility.
In Europe Dr. Kridtjof Nansen, the Nor
wegian explorer, and the adventurous
Italian, Prince Lrouis of Savoy, LHike of
Abruzzi, have united to form a joint ex
pedition. Thus the Hags of Norway and
Italy will compete with that of the United
States lor the honor of first reaching the
pole. Both expeditions are planned to
start earjy in 1901, and both will bÂ©
manned by men who love adventure and
who have experienced the hardships of
Arctic %v!nters.
"I have told Mr. Baldwin to carry the
stars and stripes to the north polo or
never show his face in New York again,"
said William Zeigler to-day. "1 have
studied his plan and I believe it is feasi
ble. I shall back him with any amount he
requires. I do not care how much it is.
"My only purpose in this matter is to
have the American flag placed at the
north pole before any Italian or Norwe
gian gets there. T generally succeed in.
things that I undertake, and I intend to
succeed in this. I haven't the least Idea
how much it will cost, but whatever it is
I shall provide that amount."
"Our party will probably be the largest
ever sent into extreme latitudes," â¢ said
Mr. Baldwin. "It will embrace experts in
geographical charting, photography and
art work, geology, zoology, botany and
meteorology. In the last named branch
I propose caixyine on observations with
the latest modern appliances and shall pay
special attention to upper currents of air."
Mr. Baldwin was asked at this point if
he contemplated the use of balloons. He
hesitated and asked to be excused from
giving his plans with any greater detail
at present.
"I will say, however," he added, "that
wo propose to avail ourselves of all that
has been found of value by other explor
ers."
Mr. Baldwin, who accompanied the
Peary expedition of 1S93-94 as meteorolo
gist, said that he would not be surprised
to hear of his former chiefs return any
day.

Some Predictions for the Year 1901
Made by Moore, the London Al
manac Maker.
In his London almanac for 1000 "Old
Moore" predicted more than one great
war, the assassination of a monarch and
a terrible famine in India, and as all these
predictions proved true many persons, not
only in Europe, but also in this country,
have been for some time curious to know
what kind of predictions he would make
in his almanac for 1901. Their curiosity
can now be satisfied, for his tlmanac for
the coming year has just appeared.
Here are the principal predictions In it:
In January there will be a formidable ag
itation in France and a severe attack will
bq made upon the republic.
In February and March most notable
events will take place in the extreme
East, and India will threaten to rise up
against British dominion.
Though there will be trouble In various
quarters during the entire year, April will
be a comparatively quiet month.
In May Ireland will follow the example
of India and' will' rebel against England.
In June the anarchists will again come
to the front and will give the world much
to talk about. During the same month
the young Kingof Spain will be in danger
from his political enemies, and he is cau
tioned to guard against them.
July will be a month of catastrophes,
the whole world being threatened at this
time with misfortunes of various kinds.
Those who are planning to take a journey
during this month will do well to remain
at home.
August will be comparatively quiet.
During September India will again suf
fer terribly from famine.
During October the dervishes will start
an apritntion, which may attain formidable
proportions. Â«
In November the kingdom of Holland
will attract attention by its dangerous
and novel diplomatic policy, and tho
statesmen in the various foreign offices
will have to exercise all their skill If they
would avoid a conflict.
In December there will be insurrections,
revolts and strikes in various quarters of
the globe. As a rule they may not be of
groat Importance, yet they will occur at
this time, and they will be the striking
features of the month.
As will bo seen. "Old Moore's",predic
tions â¢ for 1901 are startling-, to say tho
least. His statement in regard to Holland
is especially curious, and many persons
are puzzling their brains to discover how
this little kingdom can over manage to
attract attention by a "dangerous and
novel diplomatic policy" which will cause
European statesmen to He ' awake at
night.â Chicago Times-Herald.

Home of Joan of Arc.
Just beyond the church is the Joan of
Arc cottage, an ugly building which has
no charm in itself or in its surroundings,
says Clifton Johnson In Frank Leslie's
Popular Monthly. It looks more like a
big shed than anything else, for the roof
all slants one way from a very high wall
at the front to a very low one at the
back. The inside Is kept as a museum and
It has all the museum's blankness and
stiffness, with no sucrg-estion of its ever
having been occupied As a home. The
old garden at the rear, with its narrow
paths and little nlats of flowers and vege
tables, happily has about it a real touch
of humility and you can fancy It Is no'.
unlike what it was In Joan's day and the
mind easily calls up the scene in those
twilight hours long ago when the bells
of the near church rang and the voices
spoke to the humble shepherd maiden.
Patti Set Her Price.
Pattl Is a personality who always at
tracts the public interest, but she is an
autocratic little lady, though kind
hearted to a degree, says the London
Telegraph. One of her , rules that she
breaks for no one' Is .that. she must have
her concert fee before she sings and man
agers have before now found her not at
all willing to reduce that fee. On one oc
casion she had a lively discussion with
an impressario. He objected to her price
for a weries of concerts and remarked:
"But that Is more than tho PresMent
of the United States gets for a year."
"I can't help that," was the retort
"But get the President of the United
States to sing for you."

COLOBED BOYS RATED
,AS PUBLIC NUISANCES
Since Friday a crowd has gathered j n
front of the store reading and discussing
Obenauer's protest. The officers asked
him to remove the cardboard from the
rack, but he refused, so they got the war
rant yesterday for his arrest for disturb
ing the peace.
' "On account of an undeserved feeling
of enmity on the part of Officers Isaacs
and Gillen, I have been ordered to remove
this rack from the sidewalk, although it
has been there for over live years. About
eight months ago, on account of trouble
Mr. Isaacs and I had, he said he would
make me take it in."
The recent ordinance requiring all ob
structions to be removed from the side
walks is the cau?e of the trouble. Obe
nauer had a bicycle rack in front of his
store, and Policemen Isaacs and Gillen
ordered him to remove it. He did so and
put it in his window, but placed on it a
sign which read:

Franklin K. I.ane was introduced as the
next speaker. He said:
Where are the Republicans who forty years
r.sro glorified the Declaration of Independence?
Hav<- we reached a point where the American
peniile- are ashamed of the work of their fore
fathers? Thp Democratic party may be doomed
to defeat. It has gone down before In front

never gone down der.yinp the principles of the
fathers that have been the glory of the world.
Talk about pulling down the flag:, why the
most Fhamefiil pulling down the fiaj? ever knew
was done within the last Elx months up In
Alaska. American miners were delving there
and Johnnie Bull wanted the land. Senator
Mason tells how h<* saw the Sag pulled down
as the miners etood In tears at being: deserted
by their country to the mercy cf England.
This talk about prosperity and attributing It
to the Republican party Is the sheerest nnn
fonf=e. Has not Carroll P. Wrig-ht t<jld us that
depression comes upon up once In eisrht or ten
production, overo-nfidence, speculation and
their natural reactions? After a while that
depression is overcome and good times come

rrrvsperity they are trying to cheat God and
Providence.
The Democrats have promised to do eome
thing for labor. Bryan has ehown all through
his career a sympathy for labor. He demands
in th<* name of Justice and patriotism that
arbitration ehall be granted to all, so that
labor ehall not be crushed.
Mr. Mil's came back a few days ago from
Paris, where he had been with Colonel Ko

'â¢The campaign of 1900 is now well under
way. It should not be the desire of any
advocate o ft he Democratic cause to use
crimination and recrimination in his at

on the reason and not on the prejudices.
The Republican press is making Its light
on personal abuse of Mr. Bryan, and I
am astonished to llnd how much influence
that press has with Democratic voters.
Bryan's whole life stamps him as a sin

"There is but one issue In the campaign

A Common Disease, "Which Is by No

Undoubtedly many nervous people suf-

patient, and such troubles furnish a fer-
tile Held for the quack as well as for
faith healers and Christian Science treat-

However, there Is one common and an-
noying disease v.'hlch Is in no sense of the

Pile sufferers do not need a physician
to tell them what is the matter: there is
no obscurity about it. Neither will a sim-
ple lotion or ointment cure it. You 'can-
not deceive a pile sufferer into believing
he is being cured, because the pain and
itching from which he suffers is not im-
"aglnary a nd cannot be cured by imagina-

takable merit; it must relieve the pain
and cure the disease speedily or It will

Chicago, writes: "I am indebted" to the
Pyramid Pile Cure a thousand times for
the speedy relief and permanent cure of
a severe case of piles. I was cured per-
fectly with one 50-cent box, and. more
than that, I still have three of the Pyra-
mids left of the box I did not need to use.
"I think the Pyramid Pile Cure Is the
grandest thing of the age, and Ishall cer-
tainly recommend It to all sufferers.
"The manufacturers of the Pyramid
Pile Cure are at perfect liberty to refer
any person to. me and I will gladly an-
swer any correspondence. I am so grate-
ful for my cure that I want all pile suf-
ferers to find the same relief."
All druggists sell the Pyramid PilÂ© Cure
at 50 cents per box, and as it contains no
cocaine, opiate or any poison whatever Is
entirely; safe and reliable.-, â¢-_ .. .

YOUNG MARRIED WOMEN.
Pitfalls Laid forTbem-Bistory
Repealing Itselfâ What Weak-
ens the Hold of the Yqjng
Wife on Her HusbandâThe
Husband Is at Fanlt of Course,
But- __
There probably never was a time like
Just now for newspapers to be full of
eusrsestions to women. You can scarce-
ly pick up a newspaper without run-
r.irxs across some good advice for wo-
men by some v.ell-known woman writ-
er. And It really Is, you know, for the
most part pood and sensible, every-day
common sens? put In every conceivable
shape to appeal to women from every
standpoint.
Well you know that the most curious
part of it all is that while a good many
women read these articles and prompt-
ly agjee with them, they bo right on
doing thing-s Just the same as ever and
make no effort to apply to themselves
these really valuable hints on how to
get along through this world with the
least possible friction and the greatest
possible happiness. There is more real
Interest taken, I think, in some impos-
sible plan to secure and retain a good
complexion than in anything else. Of
course, being a woman, I can under-
stand that perhaps this Is natural, but
being- also a marric-d woman of some
years' standing and the mother of chil- i
. dren, I can understand quite clearly '
that there are things equally impor- j
tant. Xot that I would advocate care- i
letsncss about such things â oh.clear, no! I
1 think everything- that makes a wo- i
man attractive vitally necessary; but !
when I see women, especially young
married women, forgetting or losing
sisht of the easy things they can do to
keep healthy, and trying some fool
thing to preserve their good looks, I
feel like shaking them good and hard
and giving them a piece of my mind.
No one nt>ed get an Jdea that I am
greneralizing from my own experience,
for I'm not at all. I am saying these
things because duiing the past ten
years I've seen so many women I know
develop from skirls into women, then
marry and become mothers, and al-
most without exception make the same
rc:stakes.
It is. of course, a perfectly trite say-
Ing that the best thing for the com-
plexion is a contented mind; well you
just hunt around for the contented
mind and you won't find it, and the
fact that you don't find it makes you
think It doesn't exist; then by and by
1'o-j do find a contented, happj- woman.
and you watch her in some wonder un-
til you are satisfied that it is all real.
This woman, of course. Is happily
married to start with, but she has also
been equipped with strength and vigor
in her feminine organism, and has
avoided the Eitfal's which so honey-
comb the pathway of most women I
know.
It is a solemn fact that a woman's
happiness, her beauty and her useful-
ness depend upon the condition of her
heaith. end no amount of earthly suc-
cess will be sufficient to give her con-
tentment of mind unless she learns
how to steer clear of the Ills which
drag women down. The women "who
begin to show wear and tear a year
or two after marriage, whose first child
dra^s them down from a high pinnacle i
of happiness and fills their days with
anxious fretful nessâ these w,cmen were
not properly prepared for their perfect-
ly natural experiences, and five years
after marriacre are drawn, and worn,
and nervous and weak.
The most astounding fact of It all to
me is that with all that is written, and
ppokc-n arjd lived, showing- the neces-
sity for preparation for the duties of !
life, women will go calmly on repeating i
history, developing unpleasant traits I
vhich they never knew they possessed |
and of which their husbands never
dreamed, and all at once they see the
hold on their hu=bands slipping away
and are more than ever miserable be*-
cau?e of it. " Â¦
I am convinced that you can talk to â¢
vromen until doomsday about these I
matters and every one will think some-
body r-lse is to blame: that their hus-
I'ands are brutes, or that they them-
pelves nrp naturally weak in certain re- !
gpecifl and have a natural temper which \
they can't h^lr.. They take out their j
misery in finoine fault and becoming
tnore unlovely every day.
<"if course, these women needed help
Then they were young; they needed ad- !
vice about this and that, and they j
didn't pet it and they don't know where !
to get it now. A good many of them
have grown so used to being unhappy
that they don't really have the ambi- ;
tion to bÂ« anything c!?e. There is one ;
Â«-asy thir<?r that younpr women or mid- j
die ntstd or <>ld wom^n can do that will
be always sur<> to help them, and that I
is to take Lydla F!. Pir.kham's Ve^eta- !
tile Compound. Th^ro are a jrood many j
Â«-th<?r thirsrs that can be done to keep
and develop natural pifts. thinjrs that
Involve time nr,d attention to bains and !

formidable to the young woman I
-who ha- a pood deal to do any- !

GRAPE-NUTS.
IN HIS VALISE
A Doctor Carries Grape-Nuts Food.
A physician in McDade. Tex., who
cured h:n:.-csf by the' use of Grape-Nuts
food, says: "La grippe left me a phy-
sical and nervous wreck, with indiges-
tion, dilated stomach, constipation and
neurasthenia. I tried electricity, vapor
baths, traveling, cairping and medicines,
iid baasetxm!
"Finally I put myself on Grape-
Nt:ts food, and before the first packajre
was gone I made fuch an improvement
that it secn:ed difficult to believe. ";_ I
f;:ial!y got to carrying Grape-Nuts . in
try valise, and in my pocket when I
didn't have a valise. Yesterday I se-
cured a new case of two dozen pack-
agw.
"The facts are that I could eat. and
did eat. digest ar.d assimilate the food
and gained remarkably in strenjrth. I
am now regularly spending to my prac-
tice. I have been twenty years in prac-
tice and am free to say that Grapc-
Xuts food is the most perfectly and
scientifically made food I. have ever
known. My name, for professional rea-
sons, should not be published." It can
be given privately to those who care
to inquire by the Postum Cereal Co.,
Ltd.. Battle Creek, Mich.

tan and all other discolorations can be removed by a thor-
ough course of. Anita Cream. It coaxes a new skin. The
old skin, with all its blemishes, will gradually come off in unperceWed
particle?, thus leaving a new complexion as soft and beautiful as nature
designed it. There is nothing in Anita Cream to harm the most ddi-
cate skin nor to cause a growth of hair. Thousands, of users have
testified to the above facts.

by his legal adviser, Reuben H. Lloyd,
that the scheme to Increase the salaries
of Clerks Gordon and Zemansky in the
Registrar's office from $100 to $150 per
month, which has been recommended by
Mayor Phelan, will be a plain violation
of the charter If carried out. This will
be a severe blow to his Honor, who has
all alonp contended that the charter per
mits such a course. As the Auditor states
that he will positively not sign the de

and no evidence that a crime had really
been committed seemed to exist. Finally
Mrs. Clark produced the weapon, from
which one cartridge had recently been
discharged. Then some of the neighbors
admitted that they had heard what might
have been a pistol shot. The time they

Clark was then taken to the new Hall of

Mrs. Clark when seen at the prison
refused to say much about the case. Her
children had beer, taken to the home of
their aunt, on Geary street. The woman'3
father, J. P. Davidson, however, talked]
to Captain Seymour and said that h!j
daughter had been persecuted and dogged
by her husband. He satil that Clark had
refused to contribute anything to the sup
port of the children and that but a few
days ago in court' a Judge had made him
produce $12 as part of the alimony that
was still due. Davidson accuses Clark of
having resigned his position with, Hol
brejoK, Merrill & Stetson, which paid
him $73 a month, to avoid paying; the al
lowance to his wife. Recently he ha*
been In business as an advertising asenr.
with an eifflce on Market street. It is
not thought that the wound in Clark/3
shoulder will prove serious, as ths pistol
used was a small, cheap affair.
Late last night Mrs. Clark was formal
ly charged with assault to murder. She
was Immediately released on $1000 cash
bail, furnished by her father.
At a late hour la^t night Clark hail
not been operated upon. He was resting
easily.
Clark's statement Is that he went to hfa
wife's home* for the purpose of taking his
little boy downtown to purchase a rim?
for him as a Christmas present. He did
not anticipate any trouble, for he has fre
quently taken the children out. They

two boys and hid them away In a closet.
Then she armed herself and waited for
the man's cominsr.
About half-paÂ«t 1. o'clock Clark rang the
bell. The woman who lived on the second
floor of the building, stood at the heael of
the staircase and swung open the door.
Hardly had Clark entered when she ques
tioned him as to his business and he re
plied that his letter had explained all.
Then the mother ordered him to halt, and
warned him not to take another step in
her direction. Instead of heeding the
warning he began to climb the stairs, at
the same unbuttoning his coat. The wo
man says she thought he was about to
draw a revolver and fired at him.
Mrs. Clark's aim was sure. The bullet
struck Clark in the right shoulder and
with a cry of pain he staggered back to
the foot of the stairs, opened the door and
passed out into the street. With the blood
streaming from ihe wound Clark boarded
a Castro-street car and rode elowntown.
After the shooting Mrs. Clark concealed
the revolver In a rtour bin and took the
two children in the home of a neighbor.
She then bonrded a car and rode to the
City Hall. To the officers In the Southern
police station the woman tolel the story
of the shooting. She said she did not
know how. badly Clark was injured, but
was positive that she had hit him. She
was eletaineel and finally Policeman A. J.
F. Noltinj? took her back to her home.

finally framed which requires that candi
dates for positions in the high school
teaching corjis shall have taught success
fully for a period of not less than twenty
school months. .
An act to e-nforce the educational rights
of the children was drawn up and pre
pared for the Legislature. Children be
tween the ages of 8 and 14 years will be
compelled to attend school unless excused
on account of one or more of the follow
ing reasons:
Firstâ That the child has been in at
tendance at school five months at least of
the school years. -,
Secondâ That he has been excused from
attendane-e at school temporarilyâ the
time to be specified in the certificateâ in
order that he may take temporarv em
ployment.
Thirdâ That his services are- absolutely
needed feir the support of his mother, sick
father eir sruardian.
Fourthâ That he is in regular attend
ance at evening school.
Fifth â That there is no public school lo
cated within two miles of hi? residence.
A pupil absenting himself from school,
except on account of one of the above
reasons, will be liable to arrest without
warrant and imprisonment in the truant
school.
WEBSTER TO CITE BOARD.
Wants to Know Why Kingsbury Was
Ig^nored.
Superintendent of Schools Webster will
to-day place in the hands of his attorney
a statement of facts in regard to the mat
ter of his deputy representing him at the
meetings of the Board of Eelucation. The
boarel will be citeel to show cause why it
has refused to recopnize Deputy Klngs
hury at its? deliberations. The board de
sired to submit the dispute to the City
Attorney for adjudication, but Webster
refused to agree to that course. He says
the charter, as he Interprets It. does not
nuthorize the City Attorney to decide the
legality of any questions except those
where a monetary liability is involved.
Wt-bster cannot understand why the
lm;trd Ipnores the decision of the State
Attorney General, who holds that a Su-
perlntendent may delegate certain pow
ers temporarily to his deputy. The board.
however, believes it is safe to get the ad
vice of tho City Attorney, as he Is guided
ijy the charter, which is strangely silent
on the point at issue. It therefore ex
pects a favorable verdict and a conse
quent turndown for Webster.
"My attorney will In a few days be pre
pared to bring suit to determine the right
of my deputy to represent me before tho
Board of Education," said Superintend
e>nt Webster yesterday. "I expect a deci
sion favorable to my contention inas
much as the Supreme Court has already'
decided that in all matters of education
the State law is paramount to municipal
charters. One section of the Political
(.ode as interpreted by the State Super
intendent provides that County , Superin
tendents have the right under the law to
appoint a deputy, and under the law a
deputy can discharge any dutv devolving
upon his principal, who is, of'course, re
sponsible for his acts. The Attorney Gen
eral goes further and holds that Deputy
Superintendents of public schools of the
county may vote at a meeting of the
Board of Education in the absence of the
Superintenelent."
Chairman Mark admits the soundness of
the Attorney General's opinion, but
claims that it applies to county boards
only, and not to city boards. This differ
ence, however, is merely technical in
Webster's opinion.
-The ambiguous terms of the charter are
once more to be submitted to the City At
torney. Chairman Mark requested that
official's opinion yesterday as to whether
the janitors of the School Department are
under the control of the Board of Educa
tion or Board of Public Work?. ThÂ» lat
ter board has control of the janitors of
public buildings, but the directors are
hopeful that sehoolhouses do not enter
into that category. The large patronage
Involved in the settlement of the question
explains their hopefulness.

A bill calculated to solve the public
Fchool textbook problem was yesterday

the State Educational Commission, ia ses
sion at the Palace Hotel. The measure
will go to the Legislature for indorsement
at it? next session. If favorably received

:ion has long given the school authorities
much trouble, and the proposed amend

The certification of teachers was' an

attention by the committee and the coun

ELMER F. CLARK,, an advertis
ing agent, was shot but not seri
ously wounded- by his former
wife, Grace Ciark, in the latter's
home at 445 Noe street yesterday
afternoon. ' Clark had gone to the house
to take his oldest child * away" "from Its
mother.. The . frenzied woman ordered
him not to cross the threshold of the
house, but he refused to heed the warn
ing and was stopped by a bullet. Mrs.
Clark then gave herself up to the police
and told them what she had done* Her
former husband, carrying the leaden
pellet in his body, hurriedly left the scene
of the shooting and his whereabouts puz
zled the officers for some time. He was
finally located in the Waldeck Sana
torium, where, he had. gone to have hi*
wound attended to.
The shooting is the climax of the un
happy married life of the couple, their
divorce and the struggle of the woman to
provide for her children ana ke*ep them
with her.
Clark married Miss Grace Davidson
over eight years ago and two children
were the result of the union. Albert, the
oldest boy, was born seven years ago and
Harold two year? later. Shortly afte>
the birth of the youngest boy the seed of
discord was sown in - w ? hat had once
been a happy household. The infelicity
grew until two years ago the couple
separated and have not lived together
since. Proceedings for divorce w*5re
brought and an annullment of the mar
riage granted. The question of alimony
had been considered and. according to the
woman's relatives. Clark had been or
dered to pay $23 a month for the main
tenance of* his former wife and thei.
children. j
Mrs. Clark says that Clark failed to
comply with the mandates of the court
and that she seldom received any money
from him. She worked bard to support
herself and babies tnd guarded them
jealously. Through all the court pro
ceedings the old fire of strife between
man and wife never died out and it only
burned with more fury when Clark made
known his intentions of taking one of
the children and of making his mother its
guardian. Mrs. Clark resolved not to
part with the boy and prepared to take
even a life If necessary to thwart his
purpose.
Friday afternoon Clark wrote a note to
his former wife, saying that he would call
at her house about 1 o'clock Saturday
afternoon for the oldest boy, Albert,
whom he proposed to take away with
him.
The note caused the mother much an
guUh She had lived in constant dread of
her ex-husband since their separation and
says she regarded him as u . dangerous
man. His determination to come and take
the child from her spurred her to action
that almost culminated' in murder. When
the appointed hour arrived she took the

t- rms. William F. Blechdon. con
nected with the Labor Bureau As
sociation at yij 1 .; Market street, shot him-
self in the head in his apartments at the
Winchester Hotel, Third and Stevenson
streets, some time yesterday.
About 3 o'clock in the afternoon a cham
bermaid entered the room occupied by
Blechdon and was horrified to see his ap-
WILLIAM F. BLECHDON'. A DIRECTOR OF THE LABOR BUREAU. WHO
SHOT HIMSELF 'WITH SUICIDAL INTENT. HE WAS ABOUT TO
LOPE A POSITION HE HAD HELD SOME MONTHS.

Hotel, a Pistol Beside Him, With Which He Had Â§
Inflicted a Probably Fatal Wound.
paxently dead body lying on the bed with
the bead resting in a bier pool of blood.
On the floor near the bed was an old-fash
loned pistol, two chambers of which were
empty.
As soon as the girl recovered from th<?
shock she summoned assistance, and Po
liceman J. H. Tyrell had the unconscious
man sent to the Receiving Hcfspital, where
he was treated by Dr. Dray, who at once
pronounced the wound fatal. A1J last
night Blechdon remained unconscious, and
his death is only a question of time.
So far as Is known the unfortunate man
has no relatives In. this city, and he makes
no mention of any in his farewell letter.
Blechdon was formerly a collector for a
labor bureau, but when the director, Guy
Lathrop, went abroad, he stepped into the
absentee's place. For three months
Lathrop remained away, and during that
time Blechdon enjoyed absolute control.
Lathrop returned a few- days ago and
Blechdon would have had to resign his
temporary position and resume his for
mer duties.
Biechdon's wound is over the right tem
ple. The bullet penetrated the brain
three inches. Curiously there are no
powder burns about the wound, although
the pistol must have been fired at close
rango,
That the act was premeditated is shown
by the farewell note addressed by Blech
don to Lathrop, dated three days ago,
which is as follows:
"Winchester Hotel. San Francisco, Oct. 11, 1300.
Friend Guy: "When this reaches you I shall
beâ where? Forgive. I have been a fqol and
did not realize what the end would be. I am
too much of a coward to face the music. In
order to assist you will state the following bfils
are unpaid: Horn brothers, $24; Foster, ?26 79;
Co-operative Cigar. $19 50: Hademaker. $17 50;
McCoy & Miller, $2 50. Furthermore. I nave
had the balance of this week's after deducting
all the bills that are paid. This may help you
to get things in shape. The accounts of JtSS
are scrupulously correct, so are also all dues
fjr.tprcii for the bureau, so you need not fear
ai:y aftrrclap on thÂ»s:Â» sources.
I am sorry that this happened, but it is too
late now. Pirate accept tne inclosed pin as
a memento from me. Give all the boys my
regards, etc. I hope that I will make a good
fob of my finish. WiFhinp you and the bureau
all future prosperity, I remain your unhappy
friend, BLECHDOX.
Mr. Lathrop is at a loss to account for
the ra?h act of his friend, for whom he
entertained a sincere regard, and in whom
he reposed full confidence.
LABOR BUREAU COLLECTOR
TIRES OF LIFE AND SENDS
BULLET INTO HIS BRAIN
Criticizes Judge Belcher for His
Methods of Trying the Suits
and Errtols Harbor Com
missioners.
0
Attorney F. S. Stratton has tiled a com
munication with the. State Beard of Har
bor Commissioners explaining the final
termination of proceedings and the aban
donment by the plaintiffs of all benefits
under the decisions ' handed down by
Judge Belcher in the case of the Paraffine
Paint Company against the commission,
and that of Samuel C. Irving against the
same body. Mr. Stratton's communica
tion has been tiled that "justice may be
done" the members who composed thu
board at the time the actions referred to
were instituted and tried. Mr. Stratton,
in his communication, takes advantage
of the opportunity to deliver undisguised
thrusts at Judpe Belcher. The manner In
which that jurisl tried the cases is as
sailed and the virtues of the commission
-extolled. In the end Mr. Stratton asK-s
that the present hoard, by resolution, ap
prove the acts dene by him pursuant to
their authority. Whether or not the com
munication is to be considered a portion
of the "acts' referred to, Mr. Stratton
refrains from asserting.
The actions were filed In December,
1S9T. One was designed to enjoin the
Harbor Hoard from proceeding to further
advertise for bids tor the treatment of
piles designed for wharf and dock pur
poses, ami the second was brought to
compel the board to enter into a con
tract with the Paraffine Faint Company,
giving it the right to construct the Green
street wharf and to have the exclusive
right to treat with Its preservative pro
cess alt piles vised en the San Iiranclsco
water front for the period of one year.
The trials of the cases went on uninter
ruptedly from January 24 to March 22,
1898 On April UH the court filed an opin
ion in favor of plaintiff in both cases.
Mr- Stratton s-ays, after setting forth
the foregoing facts.
Th'.s Utlgfition attracted widespread attention,
owing to the publicity given by the press to
J thÂ° proceedings, nr.d the action of the c<.urt
! permitting tin- platrniflX with hardly any re
strictions to present evidence, without show-
Ing Its competency or relevancy, was such as
to provoke the meat dfcicled cpposltion on my
part and an unlimited number of exceptions to
such procwdings.
The trials of these cases wore markPd by the
most anomalous pmc-flur*. In that testimony,
both Incompetent nnd secondary in its nature,
was permitted to be introduced without con
necting the Fame with the Hoard of State Hai
bor Commissioners, and without showing its
relevancy, upon the mere expressed expectation
of ultimately connecting it with- the defend
ants.
The ''universal rules of evidence and of the
taking of testimony were violated. The .ourt
did, however, give to the defendants the right
to move to f-trike out all such irrelevant ani
Incompetent reftircony lf-.i&ereafter It was not
shown t-v. h- maierUl. or- Ao haw connection
with the "Harbor Commissioners.
t This procedure was adopted throughout this
trial, at which 'persons who had merely second
ary knowlerlze , jvere permitted to give such
htarsay testimony, and books not kept by the
r Harbor Commissioners were brought Into court
and Introduced as evidence against the â¢mem
.bers composing the board.
Attorney Stratton. continuing, says he
made duo motion to strike out, but not
until just before the fding of the opinion
could he get a ruling. Continuing, the
attorney says:
Throughout this long trial nothing was pre
sented reflecting upon the board, and the chal
lenge was made to produce a line of competent
evidence which would In any way impugn the
motives of the Commissioners.
â¢ Â» â¢
â¢ I felt then, and still feel, that the decisions
In these two cases were ones that could net
be justified under either the facts brought out
by the hearing, or any law presented to the
court.
1 at ence notified the board of these opinions
and asked authority to forthwith appeal th<Â»
cafes to the Supreme Court. This authority you
.granted by resolution, duly given and entered
V)f record. Meanwhile, however, both court and
counsel failed to enter any decisions In these
cases. There were merely opinions on file, but
no decisions In the sense that the term ia
employed In the code. .
'. The board desired to appeal the cases, and
I could not do so until decisions were made of.
record. Klnally, upon my written request, the
clerk, although no findings had been filed, en
tered Judgments In favor of the plaintiffs In
both case.*. This was done so thtu I could ap
peal the cases to the Supreme Court. The trial
Judge, however. Immediately set aside these
decisions as unauthorized, and thus the cases
were huns up.
Mr. Stratton sets forth the facts of his
filing petitions for writs of mandate to
compel Judge Belcher to enter decisions.
The decisions wer^ ordered entered, the
last one being recorded November 8. Ap
peals were then taken to the. Supreme
Court and bills of exception were served
upon opposing counsel. Mr. Stratton
continues:
I do not hesitate, to state that thÂ» trial Judge
has manifested Impatience and objection that
tht- defendants should seek to appeal from his
decisions, and has stated from the bench that
thf Questions Involved were merely academic.
The board In September. 1SSS. accepted the
court's decision c* to the Green-street wharf
crntract, for the reason that the necessity for
that work wn*. Imperative and public conveni
ence could not tolerate any delay.
It became manliest to my mind that there
was a decided opposition to having the Su
preme Court pass upon these cases, with the
knowledge on the part of all concerned, as I
take it, that reversals would Inevitably fol
low. '
Finally, on Octobrr 1 last, and after much
I'jior discussion as to how these cases might be
settled nnd endod, I received a written com
munication from the attorneys for plaintiffs
embodying prlcr verbal suggestions and ottering
to motllfy the judgments anil to enter satisfac
tion of the same In both cases, and further
consenting to the settlement of the bill. of ex
cautions which I had prepared, provided ~tnat
the appeals and motions for new trial should be
dismissed. In other words, the plaintiffs of
fered tr> relinquish all of the benefits, which
they had secured byÂ», these' long tilals, other
than the construction of Green-street wharf,
and by the decisions entered In their favor,
upon condition that the appeals to the Su
prfniP Court would lÂ»e dismissed.
Upon receipt of this lftter. although I had
j determined personally that the Supreme Court
must pass upon the correctness of Judge Bel
cher's decisions, still I could not bring myself
to feel that It was my dutv as special counsel
for the board to put the State to the expense
of further litigation. In view of the fact that
opposing counsel would stipulate to forego all
of ths benefits of the Judgments and to frfrego
the benefits of the trials. And particularly did
I feel this way since such decisions could not
bo quoted as binding authorities on the pewers
of the board.
In both cases Judgments for costs were en
tered In favor of the .plaintiff, and â¢ these. were
offered to bÂ» relinquished and satisfied with
out any payment whatever by the board.
I presented this letter to you and submitted
the same to your attorney, ex-Governor Budd"
with the result that It was decided that If the
plaintiffs would In these cases relinquish all
rights under their Judgments and waive all
c<-sts which they hrd expended, and would fur
ther have Fettled the true bills of exception,
then the appeals to the Supreme Court might
be. dismissed. â¢ Â¦

Later to the evening the Insurant com
pany athletes gathered at a downtown ro

etrife and straggle of the day in f^tal
friendship. Penflrld was in attendance.
THE thirteenth annual field day ot
the Academic Athletic League on
the University of California cinder
path yesterday resulted In a vic
tory for Oakland Hbjti School by
one point, the winner* scoring 40 to
Ukiah's 39. The day was almost perfect
and a lot of new men were turned loose.
Contrary- to general expectations no new
cracks developed except in the shot-put
and hammer-throw. Partin of Ukiah
broke the shot-putting- record, but other
records were in no appreciable danger.
An immense crowd was present and saw
some fine, live sport.
Thirteen hlg-h schools participated In the
contests and the total points scored by
each follow:
Oakland, 40; Uklah. 39; Healdsburg, 22;
Berkeley. 13; Palo Alto. 6; Mission. 3; San
Francisco Polytechnic, 2 and San Jose, 1.
Anderson's Academy, California School of Me
chanical Arts, Central High School and Lowell
Hlgrh School of San Francisco and Palo Alto
High School failed to score a point.
To see the way Partin of Uklah mado
the 12-pound projectile whiz through the
college atmosphere made "the lads from
the asylum town view their prospective
finish through roseate glasses. Partln
broke the 12-pound shot-put record by 1
foot 8 inches, making a dent in mother
t-arth 47 feet and 1 inch away from where
he planted himself.
The only other thing broken was the
hammer, the kind that is thrown, but
that was mended, and Rose of Healds
burg threw it so far that he secured sec
ond place and thereby prevented Ukiah
from turning defeat into victory by out
scoring Oakland.
Ukiah High School, which for two years
has held the Academic League champion
ship, had scored 33, while Oakland had
run up to 40. The hammer-throw offered
a last opportunity for Ukiah and Brown,
Partin and Dutton were doing all they
kenw to beat Oakland. The only dark
spot on the horizon was Rose of Healds.
burg, a new man, who ought to do some
great hammer throwing before long. On
Rose's shoulders (he is built like a hop
pole) rested Oakland's hope. If he could
wrest three points from Uklah, Oakland
would be safe. If he made two the result
would be a tie between Oakland and
TJkiah. He made three and Ukiah lost the
day.
Some folks thought Rose was from Oak
land, the boys in blue liked him so well.
There are no hammer-throwers to notice
in Oakland's team. This event was by far
the most exciting of the day.
The best work for Oakland was done by
Smilie, who won the 8S0-yard race in fine
style in 2:10 4-5, the record being 2:05 4-5.
Westdahl trotted over the mile, with the
others In a bunch behind, in 4:56. Wilcox
also got Oakland the 100-yard race; Weller
won the broad jump for Ukiah ana
Thomas the 120-yard hurdle. The 440-yard
dash went to Wyckoff of Uklah, La Val-
Uere of Oakland, billed ahead as a won~
der, running second. In the 100-yard dash,
junior. Long of the Crocker Grammar ran
around the course In 12 seconds. The oth
er entries withdrew. The 220-yard hurdle
went to Weller of Uklah. The spectacuÂ»
lar event, the one-mile relay, was won by
Oakland in 3:31. This event resembled a
cinch.
In the field events the pole vault was
won by Bell of Healdsburg, who made 9
feet 3 inches. Bell and Rose tied in the
high jump, both clearing 5 feet 4 inches.
If Bell had equaled his record at the last
Sonoma-Mendoclno field day he wotild
have won easily, his Jump on that occa
sion being 5 feet 8 Inches. The hammer
throw was won by Brown of Uklah. The
broad Jump was won by Weller of Ukiah.

Season Closes With
Poor Percentages.
Was Not Brilliant in Any Sense and

It can hardly be said the season was
brilliant in any respect, or that viewed
from a box office standpoint it Â¦was an un
qualinen success. Compared with last
year and with several past year.s cleaner
bull was probably played, but there were
enough outbreaks of rowdyism at that to
keep the public and the "magnat.es" alive
to the fact that purgatives of a. drastic
nature are still necessary. The records of
the season, complete to date, show some
data of deepest interest to the eager fans.
Hans Wagner, the Pittsburg fielder, leads
the whole procession in the batting with
a percentage of .2?3. Forty men batted
.300 or better. Slagle leads in sacrifices
and Patsy Donovan in stolen bases.
Chicago has one honor which should not
be overlooked â the slory of possessing the
weakest hitter In the business, Jack Men
efee, who batted for .122 in fifteen games.
Fielding averages show Warner leading
the catchers, all of the Chicago back

Develops One Crack and Some Close Contests
NEW YORK, Oct. 13.-Ethelbert, the
gallant son of Eothen-Maori, won the
Municipal handicap at Morris Park to
day, a head before Imp, the greatest maxe
of the age, In the record time of 2:5SVi.
The race was at one mile and three-quar
ters over the hill course and five horses
faced the starter. Ethelbert was fa
vorite at 7 to 5. with Jack Point second
choice. Imp was held at 4 to 1, with Pink
Coat and Maid of Harlem the outsiders.
They were pent off in the llrst break to
a goou Etart. with Jack Point in front,
but Burns quickly took Imp out in her
favorite place and led past the grand
Htand the first time, with Jack Point. Pink
Coat. Kthelbert and Maid of Harlem fol
lowing In the order named and well
bunched. Imp, running with that ma
chine-like stride, drew away rounding the
lirst turn and showed the way up to tha
back stretch by a length and a half. She
ran the six furlongs in 1:15 2-5 and the
mile in 1:42. At this latter point Pink
Coat dropped back beaten and Ethelbert
moved into second place, 'a length befoie
Jack Point. Rounding the far turn Imp
drew even further away and led into the
stretch by two lengths. Odqm sent Klhel
bert after her, however, aiid from there
home It Â¦was a duel between the two. At
the last furlong pole Ethelbert had moveci
up on even terms with the black whirl
wind and heads only separated them at
the wire. Imp responded gamely under
Burns' vigorous ride, but Kthelbert had
the most In reserve and won handily
without the u?e of whip or spur. Maul
of Harlem closed strong and was third,
six lengths behind Imp and five lengths
before Jack Point, while Pink Coat was
beaten off. All through the stretch the
big half-holiday crowd cheered the strug
gling horst s and both got an ovation when
the time, which constitutes a new record
for the distance, was hung up and when
they came back to â¢weigh in.
The other races were spirited contests.
Plato won the October steeplechase from
The Bachelor after a pretty race. In
â¢which there were no accidents. Garry
Horrman took the Champagne stakes for
two-year-olds, but had. to be ridden out
to beat Smile, an added starter, by a
neck. Conroy and Smilo made the run
ning, with Garry Herrman always well
up. The last two fought it out aJl through
the stretch. Water Color was a distant
third. The second race went to Sweet
Tooth at long odds. Unmasked won the
third handily in fast time and Annoy took
the last. Three favorites Â¦were successful,
two second choices and one outsider. The

this. season by literally wiping up the
field with the Reliance team. They had a
hard time accomplishing this result, but
in the end they succeeded in covering
themselves with dust and glory.
Reliance played a hard and fast game.
There was net s. moment in the contest
that the Oakland team did not strive for
victory, but thoir efforts were unavailing.
The collegians were better trained and
played superior football. Rodolph was the

He was erratic at times, but made up for
his faults by his clever work. Dinsmore
and McNevin showed up well behind the
line. Gus Theuerkauf's good interference
made it possible for Rodolph to make his
end runs. Theucrkauf was laid out twice
during the game, but managed to play it
out.
The hardness of the ground and fast
football played havoc with the men on
both teams. After every' scrimmage time
had to be taken to allow a player to re
cover his senses. Weirs, who played cen
ter for Reliance, made himself unpopular
by. slugging little Raitt. Weirs denied
that he did so, but the evidence of Coach
Yost of Stanford and others on the side
lines give strength to the charge of his
acting In an unsportsmanlike manner.
Yost was so angry with Weirs that he
rushed on the field and charged him
with his offense. It looked for n moment
that blows might be struck, but cooler
counsel prevailed. Raitt did not recover
consciousness for fully three minutes.
Stanford played in poor luck. Three
times they were within scoring distance,
but lost the ball. In every instance they
bucked their opponents- down to the iif
teen-yard line, only to lose the pigskin on
downs or a fumble. This was dishearten
ing to the collegians, but they renewed
their efforts and scored a touchdown in
the last half.
There was little enthusiasm during the
game, there being an absence of spectac
ular plays. Straight football was the
rule.
Atkinson set the game in motion by
kicking the ball to the fifteen-yard line.
Fisher, a brother of Forrest Fisher, an
ex-Stanford captain, rati with it ten yards
before being tackled. The clever little
half back netted ten more yards by an
end run. Gelssler and Slaker plunged
through for ten more apiece. The ball
was worked toward the fifteen-yard line,
when\ Geissler was sent around the left
end. x He was forced back and fumbled,
big Monroe falling on tho ball. Reliance
lined up* with the ball and Rodolph sig
naled a. kick. The ball was passed to him
by AVeirs and he fumbled. He grabbed
the pigskin as;d ran twenty yards with It.
but was compelled to return to the fif
teen-yard line. Captain "Babe" Burnett
claimed the ball, but Referee Oliver ruled
against him. Rodolph again essayed the
kick, and with great force sent the ball
to the center of the field, the longest punt
of the day. Again the ball was worked
down to the fifteen-yard line by the Stan
ford stalwarts. Reliance made a stand
and held their opponents and secured the
ball. Seely's anxiety to push Atkinson off
.the field made him offside and his team
was penalized. Rodolph made two good
runs with interference and brought the
ball into Stanford's territory. The last
run did not count, as Raitt was held in
the line.
The ball was brought back to the start
ing point and given to Stanford. Raitt
made a beautiful thirty-yard run on a
double pass and repeated his performance
a few plays later by making a difficult
twenty-yard run. When time was
the ball was in Stanford's possession on
Reliance's twenty-five-yard line.
" In , the secon'l half the cardinal scored
its touchdown. Trae'ger kicked off and
Varney ran with the ball twenty yards
and fumbled. Dinsmore fell on the ball
and the Reliance rooters breathed easier.
Dinsmore on a orlss-cross gained seven
yards and fumbled, but the cardinals
kept the ball. By a series of straight
bucks by Slake? and Fisher and an end
run or two by Hill, who was put In in
Gelssler's plate, the ball was carried to
the three-yard line. Reliance glued Its
line, but the terrible Slaker mowed
through for a touchdown. Raitt kicked a
goal. Stanford continued to gain ground
during the rest of the half, but try as it
might It could not score again.
Coach Yost was highly pleased with the
work of his team. He closely watched
the play and corrected many faults, but
withal he was satisfied. He deplored the
slugging indulged in during the game.

!a pood general coursing. The hares,
â¢while a lively let. were not of the fast
class which have been furnished of late,
jind as a result it was an even chance
between then and the hounds. Not many
ciscapos wore recorded, nor was it neces
sary to coil on the relief dogs except on
a. few occasions. Throughout the stake
the favorites more than hold their own,
though the dogs were closely matched

Stockton 4, San Francisco 2.
There was an element of slowness in
the baseball game at Recreation Park
yesterday, which seemed to spread over
the grand stand and diamond alike. Early
in the day Stockton began to shoot a
single odd runner over the rubber and
remained In the lead until the end. A
couple of decisions by Hughey Smith
made double plays possible and provoked
the rooters to the use of words not often
heard In polite circles.
"Younger" Johnson was in the box for
the Millers, and be pitched slow but fair
ball. Graham, who received his delivery,
was in better form than in the early part
of the season. Fltzpatrick did the stick
stunt for the locals.
Stockton's runs came In the first, second,
fourth and sixth Innings. McCarthy led
off with a hit and after landing at second
on McGucken's sacrifice scored on Moore's
two-bagger. In the second Graham, who
received four bad ones, went to the mid
dle station on Babbitt's sacrifice, scoring
on Johnson's single. In the fourth Bab
bitt scored owing to some loose throwing
ty Sullivan. McHale crossed the- rubber
In the sixth.
The fourth inning gave the local teaxa Â»
place on the score board. Pabst was
given first on balls and went to third oa
Sullivan's hit. Then Rube bunted and
Pabst scored. On an error by Courtae*
Sullivan scored.
Errors were few and hits not many,
The score:
Errors and Hits Were Few and the
Play Clean, but the Game
Lacked Ginger and
Life.

The guardian claims "that neither th.~
special administrators nor their counsel
have done anything but get letters and
employ agents to collect the rents and
there Is no more necessity of having- four
men to attend to the special administra
torship than there Is necessity of hitching
a horse to a good automobile. We know
that the only work Executor Barry will
need to do will be to sign his name a few
times. The guardian believes that a poor
compromise in this suit is better than a
good law suit."
Of a claim for 5250 presented by John
Ferrin for detective work Mrs. Dlckson
says she does not believe he earned L'50
cents. The offers to compromise are mado
without reference to the action of Judge
Greene on Mrs. Amerman's motion for a
new trial. _Â¦
The g.lardian offers to sell the gas stock
and from the proceeds pay Clarence Pat
ton's share of the following claims: i.lrs
Fannie Amerman, $2000; E. K. Taylor.
1300; Thomas F. Gr.rrity, $800; R. B. Tap
pan. JStJO; Sarah Pearsall. $620; contesi
ant's costs, $4TS.
As a special reason for her desire for
a settlement the guardian sets forth that
tho deceased left two other wills which
could be offered for probate one after the
other if necessary and that all costs will
fall on the estate. She also states her
belief that as Mrs. Fannie Amerman is
attempting to recover $7360 she will ulti
mately have to pay some of the costs if
she fails to reverse the verdict against
her.
The estate owns gas stock of the value
of about $21,000 and some realty whfch
brings in a monthly rental of $103.. De
ducting the taxes, repairs and other in
cidentals the ward will not receive enough
from his share of the income to provide
for his living expenses.
Mary Dickson, gnardian of the estate
of Clarence A. Pa.tton. the incompetent
son of the late William Patton, Is anxioua
to effect a compromise with the numerous
claimants to portions of her ward's estate.
She to-day filed a request that the will of
the late capitalist, over which a contest
has been waged for several months, be
admitted to probate witnout further legal
delay and that the various claims be paid.

J. Flanagan will preside. There will be a
musical . programme. The lecturer is
Superior to the Order oÂ£ Jesuits at San
Francisco,- . -W/
Dr. Lewis Albert Sayre. a knight of the
Order of Vasa, is dead. He was a man of
leonine face and beetling brow. For fifty
years he stood undisturbed at the head of
hi? profession. He was the founder of
orthopedic surgery as a spacialty and
probably contributed to the success of
more young surgeons in the United States
than all other individuals combined. His
nune was a household word all over
America. His hair was long and thrown
recklessly back from his forehead by his
fingers, which he used as a comb, ills
massive jaws were covered with thiclc
side whiskers. His lip and chin were
clean shaven. He looked every inch a
man, and once seen never could be for
gotten.
Sayre was one of the rough riders on
foot. His language was at times most
brutal and profane, and his respect for
mankind seemed undiscoverable. To cftr?e
was second nature in him. He could
give the average sailor cards, spades and
a beating at that game. But his heart
v as in the right place and always as
warm as toast. His stern extericr was
merely a coat of mail covering the most
gentle, sympathetic, responsive disposi
tion. Children, those tine Judges oi hu
man nature, would leave the arms of their
mothers and nurses to go -to him. He
snoke to a tot of 4 as he would speak to
a man of 50, without the profanity, of
course, and the youngster would seem to
understand. Many a childish cripple will
bless his memory.
I visited my old friend a few nights
after he returned from hi3 last European
trip when he was borne to his home on
a stretcher. He lay upon his dying bed,
he assured me, in the final throes of rheu
n.atic gout and resultant complications.
His temper was none of the best, ami his
sharp tongue was expressing in.no mild
terms his utter discontent. "Damn em!
ho cried. â¢ "There Isn't a doctor In New
York that has the courage to operate on
me It I was a cab driver they would
have killed me or cured me a week ago.
But here I am, old Lewis Sayre, and no
one dares give me medicine or cut my
skin with a knife. Damn 'em! "Why don't
they clo something for me? What are
thev afraid of? I suppose I've got to treat
myself and operate on myself. Damn
'em'" â¢
Turning on his side In an excess of
ngony he growled: "Look up there on the
fifth shelf of tho library and get down
that pile of medical journals. Thank you.
Now I want to show you who was re
sponsible for the defeat of Jame3 G.
Blaine In 1SS4. It was old Snyre. damn
him! That old skinflint of a preacner,
old Burchard. was my patient. He came
to be operated on for a rupture of the In
testines that would have ended in his
death in a short time. Hereâ here is his
picture showing the hole I made In the
small of his back, the old hypocrite. Why.
I took out a yard of his guts and scraped
'em and put 'em back, and the old scoun
drel got well and went back to preaching.
Here's another- picture. And here's an
other all showing the operation. I saved
the sinner so that he might step to the
front In 1S84 with his three R's. Why
didn't something tell me that he was go
ing to say Rum. Romanism and Rebel
lion? Couldn't I have headed him oil?"
He rattled on at a great rate, cursing
Burchard with every breath as he dis
cussed the operation, which at that time
was regarded as* highly sensational. His
anger, however, was feigned. Through
his profanity and under his agony one
could see the humor of the situation and
his appreciation of It. "Why." he ex
claimed, - "the old scoundrel could
have used the wound I made In his back
to do tricks on the stage with that would
have paralyzed Hemnan. He could put a
gold watch In that -wound and close down
on it so that . you'd never . find it.
Woudn't that have caught the gallery?
No ; professional prestldigltateur could
caual the trick."â New York Press,

HZ?T THEIR HAERIAGE
SECRET FROM FRIEXDS
OAKLAND. Oct. 13.-In the story
of the great storm of August 13
that swept the dreary waste and
beach at Cape 'Some, piling
wreckage and the bodies of hu
man beings In horrible confusion along
the tented shores of the Alaskan El Do
rado, stand out strongly the heroic deeds
cf Dr. John Purves, a prominent physi
c'an cf Oakland, who risked his life in
the terrible seas to save t*;e lives of help
less drowning men who, after stupendous
efforts, were dragged to the shore out of
the swirling. hurricane-swept ocean
waves.
Dr. Purves. with some companions who
had been with him at Nome, returned yes
terday, but the narrative of his heroism
would never have been known but for the
praise Â¦which his frltnds accorded the doc
tor as the story was circulated by them.
During the terrible storm the physi
cian, alcne and unaided, saved the lives
of five men who were in deadly peril. The
circumstances attending the rescues were
extraordinary.^ In one case the brave
man went into the sea In a small, leaky
boat and brought ashore from a wrecked
dory John Howie and Thomas Green,
who were doubly near death. The storm
had left them In the small craft, which
was tossed anl twlsteu by the blast. They
were miners an<! had started ashore from
a Fchocr.fr â¢with a load of chemicals,
which were in sealed boxes. These burst
and contact with the water caused
an oxpl^slon that broke tho stern of th"
pmall craft and set it afire. The men
were half a mile from the fcoaeh when
their peril -was discovered by Purves. who
was first to leave his camp and go to the
relief of the Injured In the storm.
Unheedful of the danger Purves headed
against the waves in a light boat for the
burning dory. It was a struggle with
death to reach the men, who had been
compelled to Jump overboard and were
clinging with desperation to the wreck
of. their frail craft.
The wind was increasing every moment,
and the waves were piling in tremendous
breakers along the beach. Large vessels,
sailing and steam, weie going ashore and
breaking up as the lone-handed life-saver
bent to his task.
The doctor reached- the struggling men
in time, and then after tremendous labor j
got them safely into the boat and guided
it through the storm-swept waters to a
iandir.gr place.
"A second time Purves went out." said :
John Laughland of 1212 Clay street, who
witnessed these rescues. "It was like
throwing one's life away. There were
two miners hanging on to a capsized
canoe. They were clinging one to each
end of the upset boat and trying to work
ashore. But the wind was sweeping them
rapidly out to sea when Purves started
out. He had a surfbeat this time, and
but for that could certainly have not
lasted in the gale. The sea was running
at a tremendous rate, and It was a 1000 to
1 chance that he would be drowned as
poon as he left the beach, but out he
went. The two men at the canoe had to
give up and were sinking when the doctor
picked them up. They were so helpless
ihat his strength almost gave out and his
boat half capsized as he was dragging
I the miners into it. But success was his.
.~.nd ho landed miraculously with the res
cued men. who were resuscitated after
hard work.
"A fifth man who was caught In the
Ptcrm was rescued by the doctor in much
the same way. And the latt*Â»r's work
didn't end there, because he labored day
and right caring for the sick and Injured
sufferers." Â«

Our foreign policy is only the President's
policy: the war with the Filipinos Is only the
President's war, and the duty Is upon you to
condemn and to rebuke an administration thai

unlawful power. It is your duty in this hour of

Mayor Phelan charged the President
with "abandonment of tho Monroe doctrine,
with bowing to the trusts In establishing
the Porto Rican tariff, and concluded:
So long as a Filipino remains alive American
ascendency in the Philippines, which the Presi
dent cf the United States has seized. Is Im
possible. The only solution of this question
lies In givlnsr the Filipinos independence.
Aguinaldo was officially Invited by represen
tatives of the United States to leave Hongkong
and go to Manila to take part as an ally of the
United States in the conquest of the islands,
and official utterances show that he was given
iOOO Ftands of American arms. And In that un
fortunate occurrence where some Xebraska
eoldler shot at a Filipino picket, for so has
Agulnaldo written of that affair, there was no
war. Military men made war out of it, for war
is their trade.
Somewhere down in the southern lslamls of
the Philippines If the prln-ipallty of the Sultan

the United Slates protecting his harrm. and
his Mohammedan religion, his polygamy and
his slaves. AnO for the privilege of that pro
tectorate the Sultan of Sulu receives a salary
from the President ot $3000 a year. Tou re
member that agreement. The Republican party
once characterized slavery and polygamy as
"twin ovlls." That strange combination down
there Ik a querr affair. Perhars It i<i one of
those "entangling alliances" which Washing
ton warned all of his successors agp.'nst. or
perhaps it is one of those international mar
rlaro."-^Â» weildlrp of the Goddess of Liberty
and tho Sultan of Sulu.
When our troops marched away two years
ago to light the, battle, and a victorious on",
against the tyranny of Spain, we gave fare
well to our brave boys as only Americans can
Kive expression to their Joy In battling for
liberty. Men march down our streets from
the r*resldio to transports Just the same to
day, but you do not hear the cheers of the
people. Why? Because these men are sent
av.ay to fight a different battle and the peoplo
doprecate the cause. Will any American
blame the, Filipinos for flphtlnfff for their lib
erty? The Filipinos are patriots nnd they love
thMr country. Never do I remember a grosser
example of bad faith than that which invited
them to Join us in the battle aeainst Spain
and then turned our Runs upon them, to kill
their babes .and their mothers.
These Questions upon which they may have
differed are entirely subordinate. Or, as It has
been said, "We do not discuss our domestic
affairs when our house Is afire." When Sena
tor Sherman declares the horror of this war.
wren Senator Wellington stands on the same
r>lÂ£tform with Mr. liryanâ whÂ»n the venÂ»rable
and honored Senator Hoar rebukes the Presi
dent â why should we not so ahead with this
battl? for right, Justice and duty? When such
men as Mr. Valentine and David Starr Jordan
give us courage, for they ere lovers of liberty,
why should not Democrats gird their loins, not
for" the sake of winning party success, but of
snv'.ng their country?
The rjeclaratlon of Independence has been
violated. The very life of It has been threat
ened, and that Is why I say vre are on Â«t re

Why should the Democratic party be afraid
when men like Richard OIney and Bourke
Gockran, who four years ago were lukewarm,
holding views on the money question opposite
to Mr. Bryan, have come back to assist us In
this battle for the maintenance of the republic
as it was founded upon the Declaration of In
dependence and the constitution of the United
States?
The Mayor paid a tribute to Thomas
Jefferson and described the enthusiasm
of the Kansas City convention in receiv
ing the declaration of its platform that
imperialism was to be the "paramount
issue of the campaign." Continuing,
Mayor Phelan said:
I have read that people hereabouts have pro
posed the consolidation of Oakland and San
Francisco. I say pay no aattentlon to it. There
are trusts enough without creating municipal
trusts. We are experiencing: a receding wave
in the aiTairs of our Government. Why? Be
cause the nation was founded a century and
more ago upon great truths, and these funda
mentals of our Government are being violated.
There is a disposition to return to the condi

The failure of the people of the United States
to properly understand the real questions
which are presented for their consideration
durir.r this campaign can be the only cause
for tho defeat of the Democratic party at the
polls In November. Only Ignorance of the Is

Mayor Jamls D. Phelan of San Fran
cisco spoke at the exposition building to
night. A large audience gathered in re
sponse to the announcement that San
Francisco's chief executive would speak
upon the issues of the national campaign
from the Bryan standpoint. Among the
speaker's opening words was the expres
sion, "I have troubles of my own." This
reference to the municipal and political
mixup across the bay produced much mer
riment. There was little preliminary to
the meeting. As soon as the hour arrived
Chairman John J. McDonald of the Dem
ocratic County Central Committee intro
duced John J. Valentine, president of
Wells, Fargo & Co., as the chairman of
the meeting. Mr. Valentine spent a half
hour in a discussion of imperialism. as a
paramount issue of the campaign. Then
in due time he presented Mayor Phelan,
who for an hour and a half held his hear
ers' attention. Mayor Phelan in opening
said:

interest, as was the last concert srlven hv

The coming week promises excellent en

Weiss, 'celli.it, and Mr. Fred Maurer will
appear. A trio for piano, violin and 'cello
by one of our local composers, Mr. John

At the same place, on Thursday evening,
another child pianist. Miss Seta Stewart,

Miss Kmma 'Wing-, who. with Mr. Lucy
and Signor Abramoff, assisted Miss San
delin, has a light, pleasing voice, not al
ways in true pitch, but of a pretty qual
ity. Her rendering of the difficult "Caro
Nome" was only moderately satisfactory,
lacking finish and variety, and her "Last
Ro?e of Summer," given in the artificial,
furbelowed fashion affected by certain
schools of so-called ballad singers, was an
unfortunate selection.
Signor Abramoff gave much pleasure
with an aria from "Robert le Diable, '
and Professor Lucy gave a clean, cor
rect, but rather dry- rendering of a
Rubinstein "Tarantelle" and a Liszt
"Rhapsodie." Mr. Emile Cruells was
the accompanist.
Miss Paraskona Sandelin has a fresh,
strong, deep contralto voice of a rich,
woody quality and fairly well cultivated.
Si^e sings with ease and expression, but
her breath control is not good, her phras
ing not always artistic and her renderings
of more or less familiar songs character
ized by curious, hardly warranted inno
vations. But, in spite of these faults of
production and immaturity, I think with
the unusually fine caliber of the voice, and
an evident musical temperament, the
young singer will be very effectively heard
from one of these days. Her numbers
werfe "Know'st Thou the Land?" and
"Flower Song" from "Faust." Her en
core, "Oh, Promise Me," seemed to sug
gest a special fitness for ballad work.
The Sandelin song recital on Thursday
evening was a pleasant affair, and In spite
of threatening weather Sherman-Clay
Hall was comfortably filled witn friends
and admirers of the young singer.
The child wonder is In season Just now.
No fewer than three are to make an ap
pearance before San Francisco audiences
in as many months, or, rather, two now,
since Irene Palmer made her bow to the
pianistic public last Tuesday evening at
Sherman & Clay Hall. Little Miss Palmer
is a charming little lady, but she cannot
play the piano. Her appearance In public
at this stage of her career is an imposi
tion upon the good nature of audiences
and an artistic imprudence upon the part
of those responsible for her education. Al
most every fault of technique, interpreta
tion and expression were represented in
the little girl"s playing on Tuesday even
ing. Rhythm was apparently understood
as a bang on the measure's first beat, re
gardless of rhythmic rhyme or reason;
there was no apparent sense of the bal
ance between melody and accompani
ment; the touch was hard and unsympa
thetic, the tone harsh and lacking in va
riety, the phrasing poor and the interpre
tations crude and unmeaning in the ex
treme. In a word, there is absolutely no
reason for the child's appearance on a

"Finally my time came, and Lincoln
turned and saw me sitting to one side.
I had never met him but the one time
some years before in Columbus, but he
knew me at once and said: 'Have you
been here all this time?. Why didn't you
let me know It?' And then he went on
to talk about various things. Finally he
said: 'You are going to defeat Sammy
out In your district this time, aren't you?'
referring- to a Democratic candidate for
Congress In Ohio. I told him I thought
so. Then he continued: 'I understand
that Sammy is a great friend of mineâ
just as warm a friend as I have. He re
minds me of a hog that old Sam " Urown
had. It got out and was gone for some
time.- Sam could see where It had been
rooting along the creek, and he said one
morning to one of his sons that the boy
was to go along: one side of the creek and
Brown himself would go along the other

"In my capacity as secretary and treas

Ohio, "I went to the capital to see the
President. I was admitted with about 150
others. It was Lincoln's habit occasion
ally to admit a great lot of people at the
same time and hear each Individual's case
with all the others listening:. I took a
seat to one side, as I wanted to sÂ»e him
and hear him as he tried those cases. I
shall never forget the simple and great
man as ha sat listening- to the troubles of
all kinds that were put before him. He
seemed to go to the bottom of every case
at once and to give simple justice all the
time. The last one of the crowd was a

wanted was to see the President. Lin

When my uncle came down he found Mr.
Lincoln giving the negro servant lessons
in making a fire. 'I made the fire in

tution.
How the Lincoln stories grow! A cor
respondent, writing to The Constitution
from near Louisville. Ivy., says:
Lincoln as a Fire-Builder.
Ex-President Cleveland is widely cred
ited with originating the phrase, "Public
office is a public trust." Two years before
his death in 1S74 Charles Sumner wrote:
"The phrase 'Public office is a public
trust' has of lato become common prop
erty." Dorman B. Katon said In 1SS1:
"The public offices are a public trust."
Calhoun said In 1S33: "The very essence
of a free government consists in consider
ing offices as public trusts." Thomas Jef
ferson said in 1S07: "When a man as
sumes a public trust he should consider
himself as public property."â New York
Press.
Some Popular Phrases.
"She was laid to rest under the mag
nolias, and the heartbroken bridegroom,
reckless with despair, returned to his
regiment."
e frantic bridegroom besought her by
every term of tenderness and endearment
to allow the ceremony to proceed, to
whlci she weakly "ave consent, and lying
like a crushed flower, no less white than
tho camellias of her bridal bouquet, her
breath coming in short gasps, and -the
blood flowing from this great, angry
wound, she murmured 'yes' to the cleruv
man and received her husband's first kiss.
A moment more and all was over.
"When- the first contusion was over it
was discovered that in all the crowd only
one person was Injured, and that was
tho bride herself, bue lay partly on the
floor and partly In her lover's arms,
crushed and bleeding, pale, but very
beautiful, her bridal gown drenched
with warm blood. Laying her on h. lounge.
Recalling tho historic Incidents cluster-
Ing about South Carolina"s Executive
Mansion, Mr3. Thaddeus Horton writes,
in the October Ladies' Homo Journal, of
the shocking tragedy that occurred there
toward the close ot the war. Tills was
the death of the daughter of Governor
Pickens immediately after her marriage
to Lieutenant Le Kochelle. "On the after
noon preceding the evening of the mar
riage the Northern army began shelling
Columbia, but preparations tor the wed
ding continued. Finally the. guests were
an assembled and the clergyman was pro
ceeding with the solemn ceremony, and
had just joined the right hands of the
happy pair, when, suddenly, there was an
awful crash, and a ball from the enemy's
cannon penetrated the mansion and burst
in the middle of the marriage chamber,
scattering its death-dealing missiles in
every direction. There were screams and
a heartrending groan; mirrors crashed:
the house shook; women fainted; and
walls rocked to and fro.

The Financier Â»ays: The statement of the
New York clearing-house banks for the week
ending Octoter 13 is tetter than earlier calcu
lations had led bankers to t>e!ieve. In the
first place the loss in cash, instead of being in
eiceFS of Ji.OOO.000. as estimated, was only
sJiElitlyj^in c-xcefB of five and a half millions.
and the heavy contraction of tlo.â¬^:.i00 In de
posits lessened reserve requirements by 13.S00,
cOQ, thus offsetting in large part the effect
of tho outflow of currency to thÂ» Interior. The
week's operations resulted in a reserve shrink
age of or.ly J1.777,P75, reducing the present ex
ciss of ?4.i?3.Ji>. a total which, while small,
has been reached several times this year and
; last. The item in the statement which show*
: how the banks have been able to meet the
drain on their funds and still maintain a. leeaj
; percentage of reserve, or one near It, is that
; of loans. The loan account has been rather
i expanded this season and the contraction of
! tS.SC5.709 has been made without much effect:
j on the market. The ruling* money quotations
Bive no sign that a fear of stringency exists
i although rate. 1 : naturally are at a higher figure.
i Calculations already are being made as to the
; dnr&Uon of the present movement to the South,
: but with cotton at high prices and the mar
ket active these estimates are apt to be mis
leading. Tbe gold import already contracted
I and arranged for prove of themselves the
; strong position of the Xew York banks In a
; money senj-e. and under normal conditions
thete shipments can be expanded at will. Half
the cotton crop oX the United States Is ex
1 ported during the months of October. Novem
ber and December, assuring a credit balance
; large enough to prolong gold imports if neces
; sary- It is doubtful if the New York banks
: will lose as much money next week as they
: reported Saturday. At any rate the receipts
i of specie frcm Europe will figure in the fortB-
I coming statement as an offset, thua minimizing
I reserve reductions.

cf a failing off in the interior demand for cur
rency, but this view did not find countenance
!n ba.Ek:r.s circle*. Aside from these ebulli

a substantial growth of & ser.se of security In

icy of thÂ«? Bank cf France to furnish export
Sold for relief of any threatened monetary cri

e^dent that the slieht delay this y<ar com

* CHICAGO. Oct. 13.â Trade in wheat was of a j
small local character. The tendency was j
weaker and deals were made largely for the
purpose cf standing even over Sunday. The
short interest was pretty well eliminated dur
ing yesterday's bulge and the majority of the i
crowd went h f ne with some long stuff on their j
hands. To-day liquidation and selling by ]
bears, who abandc.ne-3 the short side the pre- j
\ iouF session, continued in a dull way rncst j
of the session. Liverpool closed w;th an ad
vance, but it was not regarded as enc^uragrinc.
especially aÂ« no export orders found their way
ir.to this* market. The weather was favorable. Â¦
December opened at 76\Q7CHc and declined to j
7-=* 1 fi7i*ic. closing "Â»??le lower at 75*Â»53 7S T *c
â¢ Ccrn was heavy, chiefly on account of the j
prospective early movement of the new crop, j
but also in sympathy with wheat. December j
closed He down at 35*gc.
Oats were fiat. December closed \c lower j
at 21TÂ»c.
Provisions opened steady on hog receipts un- Â¦
rier the estimate, but en selling credited to an
influential packer the market declined and the
clrvse was weak. January perk closed 20c ur.- ,
der yesterday, lard 12Â»*gljc lower and ribs j
7 l "*?10c down.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
Chicago Grain Market.
Bank clearings show the usual weekly gain.
SUvcr declined again. Exchange unchanged.
Wheat quieter and lozver on the spot. j
Bariey still lower and hard to sell
Oats and Corn high and very firm. Rye lozver.
Bran and Hay continue strong.
Beans in heavy receipt and unsettled.
Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables about the same.
Xo change in Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Poultry and Game about as preziouslx quoted.
Fresh Fruit quiet and featureless.
Dried Fruit dull and more cr less zvcak. *
Outside Prunes selling belozi' association prices.
Provisions in fair demand and steady.
Xo further change in the Meat market.
Light iransjcrictis in local stocks and bonds.
Decline of 2 1-2C in Shot.

NEW TOP.K. Oct. 12.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The Stock market here was stagnant to-day.
The apprehension that money will be tight still
causes a general hesitation. The exception is
in American stocks, which rallied on the higher
prices in Xeir Tork. The dealings were not
large, but many i?s=ues were qucted well above
parity. The Northern Pacific stocks were the
best fpatur* in the American department. Sil
ver was qu:?t. Money rates were unchanged.

tional system.
Professor Fryer has a. good deal to> say
in its support. The ancient form is still
followed to a considerable extent. Chi
nese education, he said, may well be re
garded as one of the greatest lights of
Asia, if not the greatest. Its influence
upon the Government is wonderful. The
sole object of Chinese education Is to pre
pare candidates for examination for posi
tions of official rank.
There is no learning for learning's sake.
Every scholar who studies does so with,
one end in viewâ that of attaining a posi
tion of official or political rank. The fact
that China has been the largest empire
for the longest period of years is due very
largely to the country's peculiar form, or
education.

Activity in the search for copper is ex
plained by the present demand for ths
metal. â¢ The exports of copper from the
United States to foreign countries have
amounted this year to 239,297,290 pounda,
as compared with 106.969.4S0 pounds for
the corresponding period last year. The
domestic copper production this year has
been at the monthly average of 50,428,480
pounds, while the monthly average in 1839
was 45.C62.400. Jhe exportation has been
out of all proportion to the increased pro
duction, as there has been an average
monthly exportation of 32,412,240 pounds in
1900, while last 5'ear the monthly average
was only 20.S71.200 pounds. The foreign
visible supply of copper has shrunk even
with this great influx of red metal. Cop
per occupies a favorable position. The
leading dividend payers among the cop
per producers will be able to show line
results for the year 1000. *
According to the Los Angeles Herald
there are promising copper developments
in a series of buttes whjch lie to tne east 1 
of the Ord Mountains in San Bernardino
County, about 11!0 miles rrom Los Ange
les. Since early spring men have been
linking shafts ana drifting tunnels for
proper connection with ore bodies. The
Herald says the vein is traceable for a
distance of 1200 feet. Among the owners
of the property 16 H. J. Radman, a los
Angeles newspaper man. He is conlident
that the copper proposition is a large one.
Montana is fleveloping a new copper
field on the Montana Railroad about
twenty miles from White' Sulphur fcSpi ings.
The country is attracting attention. The
Western Mining World reports the ore
to be of excellent quality. The locality
is known as Mineral Hill. It lies remote
from the general lines of travel. The
dwners of copper properties in Northern
California are pushing on development
work. Arthur II. P. Bird of Salt Lake
City has a bond extending over one year
under which he has secured control of the
Mammoth group of mines and the Stoweil
group, adjoining the Balakala. The Moun
tain Copper Company will Increase its
plant. Grading has been started on the
railway to connect De la Mar's Bully Hiil
mine and the smelters. Work on the
smelter and .converter buildings is pro
pressing rapidly. The roaster stack has
Deen completed.
Mineral Wealth, published at Redding,
Shasta County, says:
Captain J. H. Roberts, the mining mag
nate, is rapidly extending his holdings in
.Northern CaliiornJa mines. Since acquir
ing his first interests in Shasta County, on
what is the famous Midas at Harrison
Gulch, he has become interested in a valu
able Sifckiyou mine with I. O. Jillson and
others. ' A. few months ago, he, with his
associates, purchased the old Gladstone,
near French Oulch, In addition to these
he holds some promising prospects. Ills
| most recent investment is in the Hayden
Hill OiEtrict. Lassen County. This district
is located on a. mountain group that crops
through the great Mount Lassen lava flow
in northeastern Lassen County.
The Modesto Herald says concerning
the hunt for quicksilver:
Alvinza Hayward and K. P. Xewhall have
bought irom A. W. Loughead 100 acrea of
land in the Adobe Valley country, in the
Coast Range buck of Grayson and adjoin
ing- lands purchased recently from Mrs.
Hail ajid G*orge Loug-head. A. W. Loug
head receives 11500. As stated in these col
umns, New hall has developed a promising
quicksilver lode on the George Loughead
land, a shaft has been sunk to a depth of
: 100 feet, a drift run 100 feet from the bot
! torn of the shaft and a. pumplnir plant lir-
Etalled. A dozen men are employed. The
development work obviously augur? well
Tor the future of the quicksilver proposi
tion, for Hayward and Newhall, In addition
to purchasing these tracts of land, have
arranged with George Loughead to develop
water for mining purposes on adjoining
land held by him. to follow the lode into
such land if it dips therein, and for wood
from the said land for twenty years at a
etumpage rate of 35 cents per cord.
E. C. Reed writes to the Globe Silver
Belt that the copper discovery Â¦ In the
M&zatzal mountains, north of Globe, in
the Brown mining district, Arizona, may
develop into a second Anaconda. Globe is
the present terminus of the Gila Valley,
Globe and Northern Railway and is the
base of supplies for the section.
The directors of the Southwestern Min
ers' Association have recommended to Su
pervisors in counties in Arizona, new
Mexico, Nevada and Southern California
to place signs on the deserts for the guid
ance of mining prospectors.
The Los Angeles Express says that
Richard Gird, former owner of the great
Chino ranch, has been offered $250,000 cash
for his recently acquired mining property
located at A&ua Caliente. six miles north
of Chinipas, Chihuahua, Mexico, by a
wealthy English syndicate, but that the
offer was declined. It was about three
years ago when ne went to Agua Caliente
and opened up a camp, naming it Guatl
alupe. It is composed of nine veins of
ore carrying gold and silver, and pro
nounced by two San Francisco mining ex
perts as being exceedingly rich. A fine
mill has already been established at the
mines, -with ten stamps, and power for
an additional twenty. On May 1 of the
present year the mill commenced active
operations, and to date almost $73,000 in
bullion has been shipped to the mint at
Alamos. Me Gird is making arrange
ments to establish an electric plant at a
point twenty miles from his mines, where
there is a 150-foot waterfall, and expects
to secure ample power .to run all the ma
chinery at the mine.
Much work H going on among the mines
at Heurick, Trinity County. Several mines
will be operated through the winter.
The- Los Anscles Express voices the
opinion that Ihe mineral wealth of the
deserts is so great that they can be made
to pay as well as the best agricultural
lands. "On these deserts there are" a large
number of claims In which rich property
is being created out of forbidding moun
tains which have been pagsed and re
passed by all classes of people for many
years, through the discovery of precious
metals where before nothing 1 had been
seen but the desolate mountain sides. Men
who began work without capital are tak
ing out wealth at a rate which could well
awaken the envy of a prosperous fruit
grower."
The correspondent of the United States
Investor, writing from Helena, Mont.,
says that, never in the history, of that
State has there teen such activity in min
ing as now. "This is largely due," the
correspondent writes, "to the increased
demand for copper, which has led to the
increased production in all of the great
copper properties of Butte. The Increased
activity, however, has not been confined
to Butte. There are more shipping mines
in the State now than in the days when
silver was up, although most of the ship
pers now are gold and copper producing
properties. The report of Kugene B. Bra
den, assayer 'in charge of the United
States assay oflice In this city, to the Di
rector of the Mint placed Montana's min
eral output at more than $65,000,000 last
year, greater by $10,000,000 than In any
previous year. The increase was due in
largo measure to the increased output of
the copper mines at Butte."
The Mother Lode Magnet says: "Work
men have been engaged for a week past
in taking out the machinery from the Ala
meda mill. It is to be shipped by rail to
Merced, from which point it will be hauled
by teams to-Marlposa, where It will be
erected at the mine of the Mariposa Com
mercial and Development Company. This
mill was one of the finest in Tuolumne
County. That It should never have been
erected everybody in the district knows.
The management of the company's affairs
during 1 its brief period of operation was
characterized by looeeness and general in
competency. Mr. Doyle- arrived on the
sceno too late- to save a company that had
squandered a fortune on fancy surface
improvements. With the mill gone it may
be that some practical men will take hold
of the property and make a success of it.

PROSPECTORS IN
ALL DIRECTIONS
OUT FOR COPPER
Farther north there are also entertained
large hopes concerning the production of
petroleum. Oil has been struck on the
north branch of the Flathead River In
Montana and several prospectors in the
Cut Bank Creek country have found oil
deposits. The Western Mining World
says the country is almost inaccessible.
The discoverers went in from Seattle.
Development will take place befqre the
snow flies. There Is no railroad within
elgrhty miles. All the drilling 1 will be done
with "the use of water power.
Development news from several Cali
fornia points is condensed as follows: Oil
has been struck in Temblor at the depth
of 750 feet: there is promise of pood wells
in Kern Canyon on sections 25, 27, 2S;
right wells will be put down at McKit
trick-.by the California Standard and Vir
ginia companies: the Home Oil Company's
eighth well at Whittier is a success; oil
is selling at "Whittier at ?1 25 to $1 40 and
there is a ready market at these prices
for the entire product. The Petroleum
Development Company has suspended
operations at Tar Springs, San Luis
Obispo Countv; San FTaucisco capital
ists will search for oil north of San Mar
cus Canyon in Orange County; leases to
Los Angeles parties have been made in
San Fernando; the Sten Oil Company iiÂ»
the Coaling-a field has suspended opera
tions, waltins for tools. There are 90b
producing wells within the 'city limits of
Los Angeles; three companies are drilling
at San Pedro and rive others have rigs
up awaiting developments.
Oil has been discovered in paying quan
tities at the head of Soquel Canyon, west
of the old Gird homestead on the Cnino
ranch. Â¦ ,,
Los Anjgrelenos have an idea, the oil
found In the Los Angeles field comes from
larger reservoirs in the east ana north
east portions of the city and an exten
sion of the field is belne sought across
the river near Olendale.
The Sunset Water Company has been
formed to furnish pure water to the Sun
set oil district. The water has been bad
and had to be distilled for domestic use.
The Los Angeles Herald reports that
the L. M. Lloyd ranch of 4CKXÂ» acres, ad
joining: Ventura on the east, has been sold
to a Michigan syndicate for $SO,000, to be
prospected for oil
The Los Angeles Times says: "Thfl
storieÂ« of fortunes that have been made
by lucky owners of land in the Kern
River section eclipse anything that has
come from the Klondike. It is onlv a
year since the first well in that eectlou
was completed. Less than two years ago
land could be bought there for ?2 &0 an
acre, and few people wanted it. To-day
Investors are anxious to get that land at
prices ranging from $3000 to S*VÂ¥W per acre,
or even more. The days of rapid for
tunes made in land speculation are evi
dently by no means over."
The language of Commissioner Her
mann of the General Land Office, who has
personally inspected the oil lands of Cali
fornia, is also suggestive. This occurs In
his annual report, and he says, referring
tc areas developed by the oil men, "they
are vast and veritable oil fields."
There are many pointers which Indicate
the popular belief that the petroleum pro
ducing industry on the Pacific Coast is
bound to be much larger in the future.
The enlistment of Senator George C.
Perkins, R. J. Waters, President Ripley,
Vice President Kenna, General Manager
Xevin and Purchasing Agent Hodges of
the Santa Fe and A. B. Butler, the Fresno
raisin grower, in the Mexican Oil Ex
jii citation Company to seek for oil in
.Mexico is one sign of the times. Another
is the contract just closed between the
Santa Fe Railway Company and several
of the heaviest oil-producing companies in
the State to take 750,000 barrels of oil per
annum for a period of five years.
