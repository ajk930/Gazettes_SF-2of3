President Back in Washington.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 23.-President Me-
Kinley, the members of the cabinet and
Secretary Cortclyou. who attended the
Union League banquet !n Philadelphia
la.Â«t night, returned to Washington at
7:80 o'clock this morning.
Message Will Recommend That Sil
ver Be Made Interchangeable
With Gold.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 25.-It is under
stood that President MeKinley will insert j
in his message to Congress a general 1
recommendation for such an amendment i
to the currency law of last March as will i
place the jrold ftandard beyond the reach
of Â£uct-e?sful assault. It is believed this ;
can be done by making all forms of mone,- '<
Interchangeable, as wa? suggested to Con
frrops last winter. - This would require that
sliver dollars, as well as grf-enbacks and
treasury notes, shall be interchangeable
with gold at the option of the holder.
This financial recommendation is the
most interesting bit of news that has been
learned about the President's message,
because it was not expected. Until two
days ago his decision had born to make
no reference to the currency law what
ever.
On the subject of the government of our
dependencies, the most important part in
the message will deal with Â» the Philip
pines. The President, it is said, will take,
the view that the time has come to ter
minate the control of the Philippines un
der war power and that the President
should be authorized by Congress to pro
vide for civil government, using th,. army
to maintain order until the scheme of
home rule shall have been completed.
This will probably be done under the
Spooner bill, which Is now pending in
the Senate. The bill provides ihat when
the insurrection has been, suppressed all
the military, civil and Judicial powers for
poverning the islands shall bÂ© vested in
fuch person and persons as the President
fhall direct.
Much space vrill be devoted to the sub
ject of an isthmian canal, based upon the
report of the Canal Commission, which
will be in the hands of the President very
Fnon. The President will recommend the
ratification of the Hay-Pauneefote treaty
and his references to the construction of
ihe canal will mean the Nicaraguan.
President MeKinley will suggest that
steps be tiken at once for bringing the
army up to about 100,000 men.

SEATTLE. Nov. 23.â Lieutenant Solon
Arnold, the naval officer who disappeared
here on Thursday night and was thought
to have met death In the Sound, was
found in the Seattle alums this morning,
dressed in rags and bereft of reason.
He now lies at the home of friends in
this city, near death's door, his mind al*il
wandering and his physical health, never
good since an Illness at Manila a year ago.
temporarily shattered by the unaccus
tomed exposure. A severe attack of pleu
risy Is threatened.
There is every reason to believe that
Lieutenant Arnold's present condition is
In part the result of foul plav. His heaÂ»l
and face are badly bruised, the deepest
trash being on the top of the skull, where
a heavy blow was apparently received. Of
the clothing he wore when found not a
single garment was nis own. Even his
underclothing had been removed ami
coarse, dirty substitutes provided. Th.3
shoes we were were several sizes too
large, dirty and much the worse for
wear. His trousers and coat were torn.
The amount of plunder obtained by the
robbers of Lieutenant Arnold Â¦will prob
ably never be exactly known. Everything
he had of value was stolen. Hla money,
the amount of which Is not known, bur
Is supposed to have been less than $100.
was eone. When he left the naval sta
tion he had a fine gold watch and chain.
Even a bloodstone ringâ his class ring a;
Annapolis, which he highly prized â wa*
removed from his hand.
Lieutenant Arnold's disappearance was
probably the result of a temporary aber
ration of mind, from which he has not
recovered. Several times during the past
year he has had such fits, the results of
the severe illness which caused his re
turn from Manila on the hospital ship
Solace In October, 1SM>. The last one pre
vious to the Seattle attack occurred in
Portland two months ago, when he was
not himself mentally for two days. At
that time, however, he was In the midst
of friends and received the utmost at
tention until the passing of tha Illness.
He wa3 ill when he was ordered to
Bremerton two weeks ago and had been
off duty for several days prior to his
coming to Seattle last Thursday. He was
en route to Tacoma, but that he was even
then out of hi3 mind is shown by the fact
that when he went to the railroad station
immediately after landing here he called
for a ticket to Portland Instead of Ta
coma, and. when he later boarded the
train, engaged a sleeper to Portland.
While waiting for the train to start ho
wandered out of the sleeper and in his
clouded mental condition vras unable to
find his way back. In the darkness of the
railway yards and the water front h<*
probably met the robbers. His mmtal
aberration cannot be charged to Intoxi
cants, as Lieutenant Arnold, according to
his friends, has never been a drinking
man.
The story of what Lieutenant Arnold
passed through between R o'clock Thurs
day night and 11 o'clock Sunday morning
will never be fully known, but it is little
wonder that the experience has brought
him near to death. During sixty hours
of exposure there is little probability that
he found any better shelter than the
| drinking resorts of the water front.
Lieutenant Arnold 13 an engineer of
high standing in the navy- Practically all
of his service has been on this coast and
on the Pacific. From 1S33 to 1SS3 he was
stationed at Mare Island, Cal. He was
then transferred to the "Wheeling, and for
three years and eight months cruised with
her. Shortly afterward the Wheeling was
ordered to Manila and he saw service
there. In September, 1S39, his health broke
down and he was sent home on the hospi
tal ship Solace. He had gone to Manila
strong and healthy, weighing 175 pounds:
he returned weak and broken In health,
weighing but 130. He was allowed a three
weeks 1 rest In California and was then
sent to Portland to superintend the con
struction of the torpedo-boat destroyer
Goldsborough. He was ordered to Bre

CONDITION VERY CRITICAL.
Commissioner Wilson Weaker, but
Still Retains Consciousness.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 25.-Tha condition
of Commissioner Wllsoi. Is critical to
night. HÂ© is weaker than yesterday, but
still retains consciousness.
The first great, crying need of Porto
Rico, the report says, is good roads. At
tho time of the American occupation
there was only one really good road, that
from Ponce to San Juan, and most of the
island remains without other means of
reaching a market or communication be
tween towns than over dilapidated and
dangerous trails, often impassable for
days, as all streams there are torrential.
The productiveness of the soil is bo great
and the necessities of existence so inex
pensive that people can and do live and
multiply in the mountain districts, but re
main forever poor and Ignorant. Perma
nent roads, it Is predicted, will work out
the sadly needed reforms in education.
The Commissioner proposes to suggest to
the Legislature that a loan be floated
larpe enough to build the roads at once.
The report of the president of the Board
of Health of Porto Rico says the number
of lepers in the Island probably does not
exceed 100, and it Is confidently believed
that the disease can be totally extermi
nated in a few years by careful segrega
tion of every case as it is discovered.
During the early history of Porto Rico
Governors and Captains General held or
assumed the right to make grants of land.
Grantees appropriated land in excess of
their 1 original boundaries and their suc
cessors claim ownership. Many grants
were abandoned. 'In numerous Instances
intruders took possession. Prior to Amer
ican occupation the Spanish Government
ordered a careful listing of real property
in each municipality, but either because
of the expense or for political reasons
failed to execute the work. This listing,
according to tbe Commissioner, must be
accomplished before the numerous ques
tions of ownership can be definitely deter
mined.

"Just as we swung up the hill," says
Paints-Himself-Brown. "& your.g officer,
well mounted, darted out from among his

broken through our line before we real-
Ited that he was making a desperate dash
to save his lifo. He escaped to the open
prairie?, pursued by seven Indians. His
mount was fresher ihan ours and he gain
ed so rapidly that six of us turned back,
saying: 'L*t thf> w.-ite man go. It is well
that one should escape to tell how In

"One Indian, better mounted than the
others, continued tho chase, and Lieuten

falter and the Indian gained rapidly. Then
the horse of the pursued man floundered
and fell. Lieutenant Harrington raised
his pistol to his head and sent a bullet
through his brain. His body lay in the
bed of Dry Lak<\ several miles from the
scene of the massacre, which accounts
for the fact that it was not discovered
by General Terry.

NEW YORK, Nov. 25.â The new French
line steamship La Lorraine, which arrived
to-day, experienced a hard trip across tha
Atlantic. In addition to the weather,
which was very rough, several accidents
occurred to the machinery which caused
the vessel to slow down while repairs were
being made. Her bridge rail was smashed
and there was a dent In the smoking room
roof caused by the giant waves which
broke over her forward.
" Two seamen are in the ship's hospital.
One man was struck on the head by the
nozzle of a hose. The other was swept
across the deck by a wave and landed
against the rail with his knee badly hurt.

Sansone and Dellla, a team of equil

Jacob Marx, a New York drummer, was
on the train in one of the cars that safely
crossed the point of danger. In speaking
of the accident he said yesterday:
TALE OF A PASSENGER.
Division Superintendent Agler said:
"A broken rail caused the accident. I
am glad that there were no serious inju
ries to any of the passengers. The train
men report that the rail was snapped by
the engine, a not unusual occurrence, In
spite of the fact that this was a steel rail,
weighing sixty pounds to the foot."
Engineer A. B. Neft said:
"I was running at my usual rate of
speed at' that point. I don't know how
tho accident occurred. It Is one of those
peculiar affairs that tho best of railroad
men cannot account for."
"We were running late, but were not

WASHINGTON, Nov. 25.â In view of the
probable call upon the War Department
to make a sudden Increase In the enlisted
strength of the army, after the present
regular force has been discharged, it is
a matter of considerable Interest to see
what may be done by the various
recruiting offices toward building up the
new regiments 'when the number and
strength of these is determined by the
passage of the army reorganization bill.
It Is said at the War Department that for
several months past the principal trouble
is to keep from overcruiting the various
regiments now In the service. In spite of
the fact that active war hardly can be
said to exist even In the Philippines,
there has been strong pressure for enlist
ment, and the recruiting offices, it Is said,
have been able to pick and choose men of
a high standard of excellence, owing to
the large number of applicants. The de
partment counts with considerable confi
dence on the re-enlistment of a . large
number of men whose term of service will
expire on June 30, 1902.
At the same time, if the army reorgani
zation bill provides for a permanent force
of 60,000 men or over (and it Is not thought
likely that It will fall below this figure),
there will be 33,000 men to enlist between
tho date of the passage of the bill and
the discharge of the present regulars on
the 30th of June. Tho chief recruitng offi
cer of the department, Major Johnson,
says it is impossible to make any predic
tions as to the speed with which the re
cruiting Is being carried on, but it will de
pend largely upon the number of officers
detailed for the recruiting service. When
the Spanish-American war was officially
declared to be ended and the discharsro of
the volunteers rendered the recruiting of
fresh regiments Impossible there were
25,000 new men added to the regular estab
lishment in the space of about six weeks.
In ppite of the fact that the volunteer offi
cers at that time were recruiting all over
the country to till up the volunteer regi
ments. The first regiments realized for
tho regular service were recruited,
equipped, drilled.' and ready for trans
portation on an average of forty-four
days each, more than ten days quicker
than the average for the regiments enlist
ed at the beginning of the Spanish war.

increase Could Quiokly

and Prussia.
â¢
WASHINGTON, Kor. 23.â According to
German press reports negotiations are
now pending between the Russian rail
roads and the Prussian Governmental
railroads to carry into execution a project
of the Russian Minister of Finance which
will involve a discrimination against tha
exportation of American rails, locomo
tives and machinery to Russia.
United States Vice Consul General Han
auer at Frankfort, Germany, in a recent
communication on this subject to the
State Department, declares that by the
terrr.3 of the proposed arrangement Ger
many is willing to carry Russian petro
leum on her roads at a low figure, pro
vided Russia will reciprocate by giving
low railroad rates for German Iron,
The press reports have It that this ar
rangement has been agreed on and that
freight schedules are now being made on
this basis. The differential rates accorded
by Russia comprise Ironware and manu
factured iron as well as pig iron.

DISCRIMINATION

THE DUCHESS OF MANCHESTEH, FORMERLY MISS HBLEKE ZIMMERMAN, DAUGHTER OF A WEALTHY

In place of the subsidy bill he urged one
-framed upon the suggestions of President
McKinley and Secretary Gage, as made
twice to Congress. The bill, he said, waa
supposed to represent the wishes of the
administration, but he declared that It
was widely divergent from what the Pres
ident desired. The objection to It. he
claimed, aside from the fact that It ad
vanced the Interests of the committee on
promotion and favored six companies, was
that It did not guard the ownership of the
vessels and insist that they should re
main in American hands arter they had
been registered. ; . â¢-" :
"This bill Is not In the interests of the
country at large." said he. "It does not
represent the interests of tho commttee
on promotion. If it becomes a law there
can be no hope for the American mer
chant marine for twenty years to come."
Mr Peabody advised enactment Into a
law of the President's suggestion that a
certain number of foreign built vessels be
permitted to come under the American
flag and be registered as American ves
sels upon the provision that an equal
number of tons be constructed In Ameri
can shipyards by the companies making
the foreign purchases.
"If the members of the club think well
enough of the resolution to Indorse it," he
said, "it may encourage the administra
tion to recommend It again, as It has
twice in the past."
Former Congressman George E. Adams
proposed the recreation of the merchant
marine by a consolidation of its three
branches, by which it would be made pos
sible for the shipyards on the lakes to
compete with shipyards on the coast.
The linking of coastwise trade with for
eign trade, he said, could be made possible
by the building of the Nicaragua canal
and the consolidation of inland and for
eign trade by the construction of a twen
ty-foot canal from the lakes to the gulf.
President W. J. Chalmers presented the
subject to the club with a review of ma
rine statistics Illustrative of the decline of
the American merchant marine. Henry
W. Peabody of Boston, with large Inter
ests in thransoceanic trade, who has been
active In efforts to secure a revision of the
Frye-Paina bill, analyzed the features of
the measure which he 'considered detri
mental to the general Interests of the
merchant navy.
CHICAGO, Nov. 25.â Merchant marine
Interests were discussed last night by the
Commercial Club at Its banquet at the
Auditorium Hotel. The Frye-Palne sub
sidy bill, which 13 expected to be Intro
duced early In the next Congress, was
criticized by the speakers as a measure
designed to promote the Interests of a
limited number of companies.

ver ten years, and seven years ago was

"If I were guilty of this thins." saAd
Mrs. Hodge at the city Jail. "I would n\)t
be here ndw. I would have killed myself
first. I'm not g-ullty and I propose to see
it out until I am proved Innocent."
Mrs. Hodge, however, refused to tell
Captain Armstrong where she was be
tween the hours of 7 and 10 o'clock the
evening of the robbery. She Insists, how*
ever, that she will bÂ« able to prove where,
she was during: those hours and that she
was not In the vicinity of the robbery at
the time. The police laugh at these pro
testations and are confident not only of
securing convictions but of recovering
the diamonds. Barr still refuses to talk.
"Impossible. I could never forget her
face. She's the woman who struck me
with the gun. I am positive it was she
who held my diamonds In the light to
pee if they were genuine. Just as I said at
the time. I have no doubt It was she, al
though dressed In man's clothing when
she helped to rob me."
Mrs. Hodge Is vehement in protestations
of her innocence. She has lived in Den-
"You can make no mistake?"
"That woman is one of the robbers. She
wore men's clothing and carried a revolv
er. She took the earrings from my ears
and my rings from my fingers an d dan
gled them in front of Barr's face.- She
helped Barr to beat me, and did most of
the beating herself."
"Are you positive?" asked Captain Arm
strong.
"Absolutely."
Dâ ENVER, Nov. 23.â Mrs. Bessie
Hodge, now an inmate of the
Denver prison, has been identi
fied by Mrs. Flora Betts as one
of the footpads who on August
27 . last â¢ assaulted and robbed her
of diamonds to the value of $7000 near
Valverde. This identification apparently
leaves no doubt that Mrs. Hodge was the
"man" who accompanied J. K. Barr and
assisted in despoiling Mrs. Betts of her
Jewels. The case Is one of the most sen
sational that has ever come to the at
tention of the Denver detective force.
When brought face to face with Mrs.

PEKING, Nov. 25.â The Ministers had
another meeting to-day to delimit the
future 'boundaries of the legation grounds.
The matter was discussed anil settled so
far as the Ministers 'are concerned. Their
decision, however, is subject ' to the ap
proval .of the military authorities, who
will look over the limits agreed upon and
decide if the urounus. as proposed by the
Ministers, be easy to defend. If they
decide there are military objections the
boundaries will be cnanged. .
The important action of the "meeting,
however, was the taking up of the ques
tion of the last point emoodied in Wie
Ministers' demahus upon the Chinese
government, concerning which there
heretofore nad been a considerable di
vergence of opinion, contrary to all ex
pectations the point was agreed upon,
and the Ministers then agreed to demand
that herouiver Chinese residents of the
city be I restricted to the space between
the walls of me Tartar and imperial
cities. Tnis space is a mile long and a
third of a mile wide.
In the discussion of the note containing
the demands to De presented to the Chi
nese government through its plenipoten
tiaries, M. de Giers, the Russian Minister,
persisted in the refusal to agree to the â¢
provision that China should agree to pay
indemnity for the outrages committed by
Boxers and give guarantees against repe
tition. The British and German govern
ments had made n,o change in the instruc
tions to their Ministers, and it appeared
as though no agreement could be reached.
A compromise was sufrgrested in the word
ing or the point. T..is was adopted and
a satisfactory agreement reached. It 's
understood the change Is simply In tne
wording, and does not affect the meaning
of the provisions.
The Ministers have sent their demands
to their respective governments, and when
the powers signify approval Â¦ of them
there will be no delay in presenting them
to Li Hung Chang and Prince Ching, the
cninese peace commissioners.
A party of American cavalry went to

the Americans attacked and captured It,

SACRAMENTO, Nov. 25.â Quong Chung,
for many years one of the leading Chinese
merchants of the city, is missing, and his
departure is mourned by a number of
creditors. Chung conducted a large estab
lishment at 32C I street. His trade was
extensive and he bought heavily from the
wholesalers in the various lines which his
store carried. Chung recently bought on
credit 30.000 cigarettes from one firm and
25.000 from another. From the Capital
Candy Company he purchased a large
consignment of sugar. From the flrnuof
Adams, Booth & Co., Â¦ wholesalers, *he
bought groceries. From one Chinese mer
chant he borrowed $140 and from another
he obtained a large order of goods. His
credit was excellent and he was not asked
for the money In any instance.
Presently, however, collection days
came on and Quong's store was visited.
The proprietor was said to have gone to
San Francisco, presumably on business.
It was learned, according to the police,
that Quong had boxed up all his pur
chases and, along with his other goods,
found a market for them In San Francis

ATVrTTRICAir KILLS A
MEXICAN WOODCHOPPER
laylor Fires in Self- Defense and
Flees Across the Boundary Line
From Lower California.
PHOENIX. Ariz.. Nov. 25.â John Taylor,
an Amc-rira.n, shot and killed a Mexican
woodehopp^r last Sunday in Lower Cali
fornia, a phort distance below the Inter
national boundary line. Taylor was the
driver <,t a etage for the Imperial Canal
C'omjiany and also overseer of a wood
camp.
He beoamo involved in a dispute with
one of the employe?, who started to a?
pault him with an ax. Taylor is a small
man and a cripple, and deeming himself
outclassed drew a pistol and fired. The
Mexican died the following day. and Tay
lor, fearing the summary action of the
Mexican courts, escaped across the bor
der.
Application has been made for extradi
tion papers, but Taylor has settled with
h!s employers and left for the north and
some difficulty will doubtless be experi
enced in apprehending him.

Special Dispatch to The CsOL
BOISE, Idaho. Nov. 25.-The Idaho Leg
islature will convene on January 8, 1901,
and the principal business that will come
before it will be the election of a United
States Senator to succeed Hon. George L.
Shoup. If the Democrats carry out a con
vention pledge they will elect former Sen
ator Fred T. Dubois, Silver Republican,
who was one of the leading bolters from
the Republican National Convention In
St. Louis. The DenAcratlc State Conven
tion, after a hard fight and by a small ma
jority, nominated Mr. Dubois for Senator
as part of the fusion deal In the State.
The Democrats will have 25 members on
Joint ballot, the Silver Republicans 9 and
the Populists 9. leaving the Republicans
'SI. It requires 36 to elect
The Populists, although going into the
fusion, did It through their State Commit
tee and not by convention action. They
are. therefore, not bound to Dubols. But
without some of them he cannot be elect
ed, as the combined Democratic and Silver
Republican strength is two short of a ma
jority. If the Democrats stand pat, how
ever, it will be an easy matter to secure
the requisite number of Populist votes by
trading State patronage therefor. It 1b
known, however, that there is rebellion In
tha Democratic camp against Dubola,
Governor Steunenberg having developed
enough strength as a dark horse candi
date to jeopardize Dubois' chances. The
Governor fought the nomination of the
Senator at the State convention, and
therefore does not feel bound by that ac
tion. The whole business will be passed
up to the Democrats, and if they do not
stand solidly in line for Dubois the nine
Silver Republicans aver they will return
instanter to the Republican party and join
the twenty-seven Republican legislators
in electing a Senator, probably Senator
Shoup. - ..."
This threat is being used as a club by
the Dubois men. As Mr. Dubois is a tar
get for all other candidates and prospec
tive candidates it is safe to forecast that
Jie will not be elected at once, and his
managers say if he is not he will not be
elected at all. His fate lies with the Dem
ocrats, and If there is enough opposition
to prevent an immediate election it will
operate to keep Dubois out. In such an
event a prolonged fight would ensue, and
it would be anybody s fight.

with the Senatorship are J. H. Hawley

Special Dispatch to The CalL
SACRAMENTO. Nov. 23.â Where is
Governor Gage? This is the question
which has taken precedence in this city
over thÂ© familiar inquiry relative to the
prospect of rain. Nobody appears to
know. The affable and obliging attaches
of Mb office may know, but if eo they do
not appear to regard it as a public duty
to tell. Meanwhile the machinery of the
State government slips a cog when it
strikes the point where the executive is
supposed to fit In. A Superior Judge Is
unable to take his seat on the bench be
cause Governor Gage is not here. One of
the important bureaus of the State gov
ernment Is compelled to postpone a called
cemferenee with the Governor because
that official Is not at his post. Murderers
are given full chance to escape because
there is nobody at the Capitol with au
thority to offer a reward for their appre
hension. Congressmen, a United States
Senator, a Chief Justice of the Supremo
Court, regard a conference on State sub
jects of sufficient moment to bring them
to Sacramento, but the Governor does not
attend it. and cannot even be reached
with an Invitation.
More than a week ago Superior JudgÂ«
Peter J. Shields was ready to take the of
fice to which he had. been elected. Supe
rior Judge Matt F. Johnson died before
his term had clo6ed, leaving a mass of
litigation awaiting adjudication. Efforts
to have Governor Gage appoint some one
to the place failed, the Governor express
ing his desire that the people should make
their own choice at the election Novem
ber 6. Peter J. Shields was elected on
that date^. More than a week ago Secre
tary of titate Curry issued a statement
showing the vote by which he had been
chosen. This statement was forwarded to
the Governor's office, so that the certifi
cate of election might issue at once. Law
yers gathered at the Superior Court last
Monday to be present at Judge Shields'
ascension to the bench. Cases were as
signed to his department. But Judge
Shields did not take the bench, and he has
not since taken it â all because- Governor
Gage has abandoned the duties of his of
fice and cannot be reached.
Nearly three months ago the entire
State was shocked by the murder of Hans
Rasmussea and William Taylor near Fol
som by some mysterious assassin. Farm
ers living in places similarly isolated ap
pealed to the officers for the apprehension
of the murderer or murderers. Constable
Donnelly came down from Folsom to
plead at the Governor's office for thÂ© of
fering of a reward of $G00, which the State
law authorizes. The Sheriff and restrict
Attorney joined In the request. Governor
Gage has not offered a reward for the
capture of the murderer or murderers, and
even though the officers In other counties
learned a clew they would not be Justified
in gt>ing to a dollar's expense in pursuing
it. Former Governors. Issued a reward for
murderers immediately upon the showing
by the proper authorities that such an In
ducement was necessary in the Interests
of justice. The official who goes to the
Governor's office to urge action on the
part of the executive will be told that the
Governor is not in town.
On Thursday last the trustees. of the
Preston School of Industry congregated
here from their homes in various parts of,
the State to confer with Governor Gage
relative tÂ© the selection of a new super
intendent to take the place of David
Hirschberg. resigned. The Governor was
not in the city anu the trustees could not
learn when he would be. The conference
was declared off and the chaotic state in
which the Preston School has fallen must
remain.
Yesterday there was held in this city a
conference of vast importance to the
whole State of California. The Sacra
mento Valley Development Association
had arranged a meeting with the United
States Senators. Congressmen, State Sen
ators and Assemblymen relative to legis
lation needed at the hands of Congress
and the State Legislature by the great
Sacramento and San Joaquln valleys.
Chief Justice Beatty deemed it of such im
portance as to deserve his presence. Ja
cob Neff, the venerable Lieutenant%Gover
nor, came down from the mountains In
epite of the cold to be present. United
States Senator Perkins and Congressmen
elect Coombs and Woods canceled all
other engagements for it. Governor Gage
was not present, nor, so far as known,
was any business of State keeping him
away.
The constitution fixes Sacramento as the
official scat and place of residence of the
Governor. Since Governor Gage has given
up his residence here people are asking
why he does not take the Capitol with
him, or at least establish a long-distance
connection between himself and the Indi
viduals and public bodies having .business
with his office.

11 o'clock last night that has ever oc

wife, nine children and his wife's sister.

comely appearance. 2S years old. The lat
ter Â¦w^e.s the sole cause of the tragedy.
L. J. Hardenbrook. a voung man 29
years of age. a resident of Drain, had met
and loved Miss Beeson previous to her
leaving the town aM the twro were en
paged to be married at an early day. The
attentions of Hardenbrook to his slster
!n-law were distasteful to Traylor. and
the marriage was stoutly opposed by the
man to the extent of his forbidding Har
denbrook to visit the young woman until
a few days ago, when he sent word to
the young man asking him to visit them
In their new home.
In response to the Invitation Harden
brook arrived at Jacksonville on Friday.
LÂ»ast evening he was being entertained by
the family at their home in the northern
part of the town. Travlor and wife. Miss
Beeson and Hardenbrook occupying tha
front room of the house for the entire
evening: in conversation of a most agreea
ble and pleasant nature. At about 11
o'clock Traylor excused himself, shortly
afterward foilo-wed by Mrs. Traylor. A
lew moments later a shot was fired from
The porch into the room occupied by Miss
Beeson and Hardenbrook. The bullet
passed throt^rh the window, striking Har
denbrook in the back of the head. ThÂ«
victim fell forward and was caught by the
young woman, who placed him In his
chair. The screams of the two women
brought neighbors to the scene of the
murder and medical aid was summoned,
but the man died in an hour from the
time he was shot, without regaining con
sciousness.
The murderer, after viewing the result
of his deadly work, repaired to a vacant
;<n a short "distance from the house and
reloading his crrn placed it beneath his
chin and pulled the trigger with his foot.
The bullet tore away part of the nose and
fa.ee. but was not fatal and the desper
ate man firr-d a second shot. It entered
the forehead just above the nose and
death must have been instantaneous.
It developed at the Coroner's Inquest
this afternoon that the murderer and sui
cide was of unsound mind, and it Is re
ported he was infatuated with his sister
in-law and that perhaps Jealousy of Har
denbrook rendered him hopelessly insane.

SOUTH AMERICAN
WAR THREATENED
Various Republics Seeming
ly Aligned Against
But the chief concern has been ex
pressed in Argentina and Brazil, as it is
the feeling in those countries that the
powerful armaments of Chile are not re
quired against such enfeebled states as
Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador and the other
northern republics, but will be iised
against Chile's more powerful neighbors
In tho south. Argentina â¢ and Chile are
separated by a lone boundary line which
la now In dispute. The boundary question
frequently has threatened an armed con
flict and each country has been steadily
increasing its armament, land and naval.
It is estimated by one of the prominent
observers in Washington that each coun
try has spent about $50,009,000 on armament
during the last ten years.
Brazil recently has been brought Into
alignment by a cordial restoration of good
feeling with Argentina. For a time they
were opposed over a boundary contest,
but by the arbitration of the United
States the award was made in favor of
Brazil, and Argentina has heartily I ac
cepted this result. The Presidents of Bra
zil and Argentina have exchanged visits,
and during the stay of President Salles at
Buenos Ayres recently consideration I was
given to united action on some of these
pending South American controversies.
The several movements have had the
general effect of establishing a common
basis between Bolivia, Peru, Argentina
and Brazil. While there is no suggestion
thus far that the united republics would
use force against Chile, yet it is appreci
ated that the present situation may lead
to serious results. The Chilean army is
directed by able officers, the commander
being General Koener, a German officer,
Â¦who was placed at the head of the army
about ten years ago. Some forty other
foreign officers, chiefly German, also oc
cupy leading places on thÂ« staff and line.
About a month ago Chile adopted the
compulsory military system, under which
every male citizen on reaching the age of
nineteen years must serve as a soldier.
This has caused widespread concern in
South America and has led other countries
to take steps toward similar military
equipment. Ecuador has declared its pur
pose of adopting a system like that of
Chile, and Peru has taken steps to have
a general enlistment in Its National
Guard.
Aside from the immediate questions in
volved, the decision of the congress is
regarded in South American quarters as
significant of the alignment of the south
ern republics on the increasing- differences
which have arisen of late and which are
threatening to bring about a general crisis
Involving most if not all of the South
American countries. Several events have
occurred recently Indicating: a widespread
movement Peru has been making des
perate efforts to regain her provinces of
Tacna and Arica, which are a sort of
border hostage held for the last ten years
by Chile. Bolivia is involved in the same
controversy, as she has 'lost her sea coast
to. Chile and is now seeking to save a
part of it. The latter question was re
cently brought to a direct issue by the
presentation of a demand from Chile, gen
erally construed as an ultimatum, requir
ing 1 Bolivia publicly to acknowledge by
treaty the sovereignty of Chile over the
sea coast in question.

the Lombard-street widow,
James was without ready cash, so he
approached a real estate firm and placed
his wife's Lombard-street property on th*

low figure. The sale was consummated,
but the real estate firm never received Its

she would lay down her life for her

SAN DIEGO, Not, 25.â For four flays
Lieutenant Governor G. R. Azcarate of
Tia Juana, with the full force of rurales
and gendarmes from Tia Juana, Tecate
and all along the border between the
United State and Mexico, has been scour
ing the Plcacho countrv below the llna
for the Indians suspected of the triple
murder committed early in the week on
the desert. This morning he arrested An
tonio Carplntero and Manuel Lyabao at
Rancho Niji, where they were In hiding
and where the other Indians were pro
tecting them. : The two suspects are now
In the cuartel at Las Juntas and will bo
taken to Ensenada early In the week or
as soon aa the Lieutenant Governor is
satisfied that the third suspect, an Indian
by the name of Ortiz, cannot be captured.
This third man is supposed to have eÂ«
caped to this side of .the line and. to be
In hiding In some of the reservations In
tho mountains southwest of tw* city near
Campo. It is known that a strange Indian
has appeared at one. of the rancheria.3
there, but the officers, not yet having
been asked to' look him up, have not at
tempted to discover where he came from
or where hÂ© is.
Governor Azcarate has learned that the
murder of Coslmero, the store keeper at
Juarez, and of Y. Sotellom and B. Muriet.
the last named an officer of the ruralos
police force, occurred during a rescue of
certain Indian prisoners under arrest for
cattle stealing. Acuna, the store keeper,
had been misslnc cattle from his herd
at Juarez and, with the other two, had
started out in pursuit of the thieves.
Whoever the thieves wero the three came
up with them and placed them under ar
rest. They were on their way back to
Juarez with the thieves when, with the
assistance of an Indian not under arrest,
they succeeded in overpowering and kill
ing their captors and in making their es
cape.
it is not known whether the two under
arrest forMhe murder are the same ones
who were first arrested for cattle stealing
by the men who are now dead, but it is
supposed that they aie. The fact that
a murder had been committed was not
known until several days after the kill
ing, when the bodies were founu alongside
the trail across the desert. Another party
of rurales was sent out to find and bury
the bodies- and has reported the accom
plishment of the purpose.
It is believed that the usual Mexican
swift justice will be meted out to ths
murderers and the death penalty will be
inflicted at no distant date.

OUT of the Sacramento conference it is reason
able to expect that much good will come. A
gathering composed of representatives of the
Development Association of the Valley, members of
Congress from the State and members of the Legisla
ture from districts within the region covered by the
association, certainly had in it all the' elements re
quired to devise a "comprehensive plan of improve
ments and to give it an effective support, both at
Sacramento and at Washington. â¢ ' .
The discussions at the conference naturally included
a wide range of subjects, all of which are important.
Due attention was given to the movement for devis
ing a plan for protecting our forests and preserving
the water supply. That issue indeed is one which can
not at this time be overlooked at any gathering of
representative Californians, who meet to consider the
welfare of the State. Other measures of hardly less
importance were also taken up, and ways and means
agreed upon for promoting them.
According to the reports the conference agreed that
California Congressmen should ask for a clause in the,
river and harbor bill authorizing the engineers to use
the money appropriated for the lower Sacramento on
any portion of the river desired. It was also decided
that $300,000. more was needed for dams to impound
mining debris.
In the effort to obtain these and. other improve
ments requiring aid or legislation from the Federal
Government the people of California will profit much
by their wisdom in re-electing so many Congressmen
who have already had experience in the House. Our
State delegation iri the next Congress will be made
up mainly of men who have been iri the House long
enough to learn its methods of procedure and Â¦ to
make their personal influence felt. Consequently, even
if all that is asked for be not obtained at the coming
session this winter, there will be a good chance of
success when the new Congress meets. We are on
the right .toad at last, and now, if harmony prevail
and all members of the State delegation work together
for the whole State, we may expect .California to at
tain at the national capital the prestige and influence
that are rightly hers.

BRITISH FINANCES.
T T NDER ordinary circumstances the new British
I I Parliament would not meet until after the Janu*
ary holidays. The circumstances, however, arc
not ordinary. The empire is in need of money. The
estimates 'for the expenditures of the war in South
Africa were far short of the real cost; and conse
quently Parliament will have to meet for the purpose
of providing, the Ministers with money.
For many a year past British financiering has been
a comparatively simple matter. The fiscal policy of
the country has remained undisturbed, and whether
Conservatives or Liberals were in power has been d
matter of little moment to the business interests of
the people. It is now probable a change may. take
place, and that fact gives to the new Parliament an
irtercst to the industries and the commerce of the
empire which has not been felt before by men of this
generation.
Two facts confront the nation. There must be an
increase of revenue obtained by an increase of taxa
tion, and there must be money borrowed to meet the
immediate needs of the Government. Each of these
focts presents a new issue to the people. How shall
the revenues be increased? For the first time in this
generation there is a strong party that advises an in
crease of tariff duties; that is to say, a surrender qf
the free trade principle. How shall the money be
borrowed? There is a party that claims the loan
should not be offered on equal terms to all the world,
but that it should be placed at home, and that also is
a surrender of free trade. . ' . Â¦
It is not likely that either of these "home market"
ideas will win at this time. So far as the loan is con
cerned, the advocates of borrowing money where it
can be borrowed cheii>est appear to be in control of
the situation. London dispatches of the 24th quote
the new Lord Mayor as saying: "It is merely a
n atter. of utilitarianism. American capital is bound
to improve business here. As to placing government!
loans in America, patriotism naturally prompts me to
say English financiers should have the first chance;
but if Americans give better terms, why let them
have them by all means."
That view of the financial question will probably
prevail without trouble, but all signs point to the con
clusion there will be u. harder fight on the question
of taxation. The present government has increased
the income tax to one shilling, has added a new
stamp duty and augmented the taxes on wine, tobacco
and tea. It is argued with a good deal of force that
such taxation cannot be safely carried much further,
and that for the additional revenues required tariff
taxes must be imposed. A writer in .the National
Review presents the question in this way:
"Beer and tobacco are already so heavily mulcted
that they cannot carry greater imposts. Whence
then are we to get the millions which will be needed
if our national position is to be rendered secure? I
answer that the political fads of the '50's and '60' 5 and
'70's must be discarded by a new administration. The
conditions which rendered them useful and salutary
have long since passed away; yet such is the force of
routine, such that inertia of mind to which allusion
has been so often made, that men are still enslaved
by them. As we shall have to fight for our lives we
must neglect no weapon. A tariff offers us at once
a means of raising funds for naval armaments, of ob
taining allies and of weakening the enemies who are
plotting our fall. With a tariff, too, we can consoli
date the empire. * * * I have never been able to
understand why in our customs system we should
divorce political aims from finance.. The two go
hand in hand, and do not lie in separate, water-tiglu
compartments. Nor can we afford in these times to
lose so valuable and so keenly tempered a weapon as
a tariff. Living in a world of protectionists, however
much we may regret it, we also must protect."
One further issue is to be noted. The Government
has repeatedly said the Transvaal must be made to
pay a large part of the cost of the war. Now, as any
taxation upon the impoverished farms of the land is
well nigh impossible, that means the gold mines must
be taxed; and the owners of the mines have begun
already to protest. They assert that the chief griev
ance of the outlanders against the Boers was the heavy
taxation of the mines, and ask with a good deal of
indignation if the British Government is now going to
step in and tax them more heavily still.
It will be seen that the questions are inte-esting
and are of importance to more people than the
British. In fact, the coming year may see the col
lapse of free trade in the land of its birth, and that
change will affect commerce all over the globe.
An enterprising New Yorker having made a close
study of a photograph of the Prince of Wales discov
ered that the trousers of the Prince were not creased,
and now the clubmen of the city are wondering what
to do about it. An impression prevails that creases
must vanish.
BREAK NG THE TRADE RECORD.
THE feature of commerce last week was the an
nouncement of the October exports from the
United States, showing that the month had
broken all previous records in this business. Nor is
this all. The ten months ending October 31 also
broke all records, so it appears that the assertion,
often made of late, that the export trade of the coun
try was greater than ever before was based on fact.
The exports in October amounted to $163,093,597, or
double those for October, 1894. The exports for the
ten months amounted to ?i, 194,775,205, or double
those for the corresponding period in 1894. During
the ten months of 1900 the exports exceeded the im
ports by $499,667,936, while in the same ten months in
1 8-54 the reverse was the case â the imports exceeding
the exports by $96,663,369. Thus in six years we have
doubled our export trade. The year 1000 will, for the
first time in the history of our commerce, show an
export of more than $100,000,000 value in every month
of the year, while for the first time a single month â
October. 1000 â passes the $150,000,000 line.
This gratifying condition bids fair to keep up. All
commercial reports indicate a continuatiori of this
remarkable export demand, and domestic business
also shows improvement. Thus the country's bank
clearings last week showed a gain of ig.8 per cent
over the same week last year, and, what is equally
promising, all of the very largest cities exhibited an
increase, that of New York being 26.4 per cent.
There have been a number of stock brokerage failures
in Wall street since the excitement following the
election: but this was to be expected, as all violent
periods in stocks catch some operators on the wrong
side, no matter whether the market goes up or down.
The failures for the week were 238, against 191. for
the same week last year.
The staples showed little change during the week.
Wheat continued to decline, owing to large supplies
the : world over. The visible supply 'is 8,060,000
bushels more than at this time last year, the quantity
in store and afloat is more than liberal, while in the
United States stocks zX terminal points are immense.
These conditions form too heavy a load for the mar
ket to carry, and it is depressed in consequence. The
iion trade, on the contrary, seems to be in good shape,
as all branches report a good demand at steady and,
in some instances, rising prices. Wool, like wheat,
is making a poor showing at the moment. Unseason
able weather in the East and West has cut down the"
demand for clothing materiallj', sales at Atlantic mar
kets are far below the season volume, and the
liquidation of embarrassed concerns threatens to
throw quantities of stock on the market. Aside from
this depression in textiles, however, manufactured
goods are meeting with a better distributive demand
zx many points, and prices in some are rising in re
sponse to this improved inquiry. â¢ Otherwise there is
nothing new in the staples.
The stock business in Wall street continues large.
The public, after holding aloof for nearly a year, have
started in to buy, and purchases for investment are
enormous. In fact, most of the business just now is
for this account. Money has naturally hardened
under this activity, but there has been no pressure on
the market, and indeed rates have not advanced as
much as anticipated.
In the San Francisco market there is almost noth
ing new. There is 1 good, steady demand for all
classes of merchandise, and the export trade of the
port continues brisk. Cereals are dragging some
what, being, in fact, the most unsatisfactory line of
Hade at the moment. Otherwise conditions remain
the same as for some weeks.

THE EAST WAKING UP.
ONE of the most gratifying features of the pres
ent discussion of arid land problems brought
about by the meeting of the Irrigation Con
vention at Chicago is the evidence given of Eastern
interest in the subject. For a long time the press of
that section treated the matter as if it were a Western
scheme to loot the Treasury, but now a new light has
dawned upon some of the more influential papers and
they are coming forward in support of the project.
Along with the change in the press comes a change
in the sentiment of business men in the East. Thus
the Republican of Springfield, Mass., recently pub
lished a letter from a correspondent in Chicago say
ing: "It would seem strange, at first, that so few
business men realize what'vast possibilities there are
for commercial development in the West through the
irrigation of the arid lands. But the majority, no
doubt â like ourselves until recently â have given the
matter very little thought. We have, however, of late
given the subject consideration, and we have become
deeply impressed .with its importance to all the com
mercial interests of the country. There is no doubt
that the Government ought to take hold of the
problem in a broad way as recommended by its own
engineers and experts, and preserve the forests, build
reservoirs to save the flood waters, and build the great
dams and main' line xanals necessary to bring the
water within reach of settlers on the public land. If
this were done, what is now a vast uninhabitable waste
would be rapidly, filled with a dense and prosperous
population."
1 It would be difficult to exaggerate the benefits that
would result to all sections of the Union and to the
business interests of all by a comprehensive system of
irrigation of the arid districts. It is said there arc
upward of- 75,000,000 acres of land in the national do
main that can be brought under cultivation by irriga
tion at a. cost of about $150,000,000. The expenditure
v/buld be in the nature 'of an investment, for the rev
enues derjved from the products of the redeemed soil
would repay the. Government even if tht lands should
be thrown open to free settlement instead of being
sold.. Such; a region could 1 support a population of
many millions of. people, providing a new market for
AFTER all that has been said of the significance
of the popular vote in the recent election it has
been left for President McKinley to state it
best. He has given in due proportion credit, to each
of the great popular elements that combined to
achieve the victory. These elements were the stalwart
Republicans, the conservative Democrats, honest
anti-imperialists who, while opposed to the Philippine
policy of the administration, were yet sufficiently
patriotic to suppprt it against Bryanism; the Republi
can contingent' which, after leaving the party on the
financial question in 1896, returned to their rightful
allegiance this year; and last but by no means least
what the President called "the almost unbroken col
umn of labor," and business men in every part of the
country.
Concerning the issues which brought all thesei ele
ments of the people into harmonious action at the
polls, the President said:
"It is not the triumph of an individual, nor alto
gether of a party, but an emphatic declaration by the
people of what they believe and would have main
tained in government. . A great variety of subjects
was presented and discussed in the progress of the
campaign. It records the unquestioned indorsement
of the gold standard, industrial independence, broader
markets, commercial expansion, reciprocaltrade, the
open door in China, the inviolability of public faith, the
independence and authority of the judiciary and peace
and beneficent government under American sover
eignty in the Philippines. American credits are un
impaired, the honor of. the American flag unsullied
and the obligations of a righteous war and treaty of
peace unrepudiated."
An election of such a character imposes great re
sponsibilities upon the administration. There is now
no such thing as a genuine opposition party in the
country. The fused elements of Democracy, Popu
lism,-free silverism and bourbonism, which made up
the Bryanite party, are rapidly resolving back to the'u
primitive condition. There is no organization capable
of intelligent criticism and restraint upon the action
of the party in power. Thus the administration has
virtually no limit upon its action within the scope of
the constitution, and has to meet every issue of the
time with an undivided responsibility. The Presiden:
very justly pointed out that many of these issues "are
too exalted to be matters of partisanship." and tha:
statement in itself gives assurance that the administra
tion in the performance of its duties will be guided by
patriotism and wisdom.

period. The greatest increase In 1S93 was
in the value of the pigiron product, which

The increase In ths coal production

higher than for a number of years past.
Crude petroleum advanced nearly $20,500,

ployers was read. It provides for closing
&.t b p. m., excepting Saturdays, after Jan
uary 1. Miss Alice Edwards said that an
exception should also be made of the two
weeks preceding Easter. All the girls
agreed that their employers would justly
insist on keeping the stores open evenings
during that time.
George Lynch, whose mother owns a
millinery store at Market and Sixth
streets, was one of the three or four men
preeent. He said* that late closing for
two weeks before Easter would satisfy
the employers. The girls applauded. Miss
Bailie suggested that three evenings a
week for those two weeks ought to satisfy
the employers. Lynch thought that at
least keeping open every evening for
those two weeks would be too much for
the employers to ask, and the girls ap
plauded again and murmurs of "Good
Doy, Georgie," were heard. George liked
the applause and spoke again and voted
on propositions and offered amendments
just as if he were a trimmer or a sales
woman.
The discussion developed the fact that
en exception would also have to be made
of the two weeks preceding Christmas and
of the evenings preceding legal holidays
and the Jewish new year. The attempt to
get these exceptions embodied in the draft
of the agreement caused the meeting to
become tangled up in a snarl of motions
and amendments until everybody gave It
up In despair and they besan all over}
rgain and a motion including all those ex
ceptions was written out by the secretary
and passed unanimously.
Joseph Hayes, â¢who is not a milliner, but
who is connected with a wholesale mll
linory firm, took part in the bombardment
of amendments ~ by offering one himself.
Hayes did not make a hit. His EnCTsh
was not trimmed to suit the girls and his
suggestion found no favor.
. A pretty sirl from Keith's wanted a vote
of thanks to be given "the shoemakers"

resenting the Retail Shoe Clerks', Protec

My dear people and beloved children, the
first thought that should be In your mind
should be of thankfulness that God has been
good enough to allow you to receive this
blessed eacrament of confirmation. This beau
tit ui sacrament teaches us a lesson and Â¦ that
is how near we can be to our Father. He is
very near to us, and like a friend will. If we
Â¦wish It, walk with us through our lives. We
Bhould also be very thankful to these good
brother* and sisters that Have instructed these
children about the sacrament that they are re
ceiving to-day. Never forget their good works
and always include them and your pastors In
your prayers. The great question that as
serts itself is how will these children grow
up? The time of confirmation is just when
the child's dangers first b*>gin. They are not
then their own masters: they are guided by
the Influence and wisdom of their parents.
This - danger often lasts when they grow up
until they have a home of their own. What
children should do as well as their , parents
is pray for that restraining power to lead good
lives to the honor and ylory of our holy faith.
I wish to sp^aU especially this afternoon on
Catholic education. Most children attend Sun
day school, but at the best it is a poor make
shift. The beat that can be said of Sunday
school is that it Is better than nothing at all.
You "have a splendid day school In this parish
and Â¦all children should attend It. The teach
ers are scholarly men and can fit any child for
the ordinary walk* of I life. In this way -boys
and girls can be taught Catholic principle* not
only on Sundays, i but eVery day In the week.
The cause of so many people becoming care
less when they rrow . up and fall away from
our holy faith is through Ignorance of the doc
trines or reliaion. Â¦ Â¦Â¦-:.-. .--;., â¢- - : - . â¢Â«-

His Grace Archbishop Riordan adminis
tered the sacrament of confirmation to a
large class of boys and girls yesterday
afternoon at SU Joseph's Church. The
gaJleries were crowded with a large con
grreg/ation, which took a deep Interest and
followed the service most devoutly. The
main aisles of f he church were especially
reserved for the children who were to be
anointed. A few minutes before 4 o'clock
the girls, all dressed in white, marched
into the church, under the direction of
several sisters of the Holy Name. The
children recited the creed while waiting
the arrival of the Archbishop. The boys
took seats on the right side of the church
a few minutes later.. They were under the
care of the Christian Erothers of St. Jo
seph's School.
After the children had sung the "Veni
Creator" the Archbishop, accompanied by
several of the local clergy, entered the
sanctuary. His Grace was invested in a
white cope and mitred and after making a
short prayer he received hi3 crozler from
the hands of Father Mulligan, and facing
the congregation xvaited for the boys to
approach the high altar. After all the
boys had been anointed the girls received
the sacrament.

f?y^2 HE Oceanic Company's new
11/ steamship Sierra drew a crowd to
1 1 the Pacific-street wharf, while the
Â»X transport Slam, newly arrived
from Manila, drew & great throng
to the transport dock yesterday. Out
side of these vessels there was little of
interest on the front. The rain kept the
usual crowd at home and things along the
front were very dull.
The Siam brings no news from Manila
and no passengers. She was 42 days mak
ing the run. and coming by the way of
the Great Circle took 27 days to get here
from Nagasaki. Consequently she brings
no late news, and her officers explain the
long trip by saying that the engines need
an overhauling.
The Sierra Is being prepared for her trip
on December 12, and yesterday a gang of
men was at work painting and scrubbing
end removing the Elgna of her long voy
age around the Horn. In a few days she
will bfigin to look like the ocean beauty
ehe Is. and then the general public will
have a chance to see her In all her war
paint.
The Sierra Is a handsome vessel and
from truck to keelson even an expert can
not see anything to find fault with.

Commodore W. N. McCarthy presided at
aii animal ed meeting m the Ban Francis
co Yacht Club house at Sausalito yester
day morning. Among those present were
Adolph Sylva, president of the Town
Council of Sausalito, ibe secretary of the ;
Council, ex-Commodore C. H. Harrison,
ex-Commodore Dr. T. L. Hill of the sloop ;
Cygnus, R. S. Bridceman of the sloop
Thetis J. R. Savory of the sloop Juanlta,
li. D. Campbell of the cutter Folly. E. C
Eartlett. secretary of the San Francisco
Yacht Club, and William Toll.
The meeting having been called to order
Commodore McCarthy stated that Its ob-
Ject was the conside-ra-tion of a. request,
that the yacht owners during the winter
would remove the buoys or floats mark
ing their mooring? fo that revenue cut
ters and other Government vessels may
b*- able to anchor close Inshore. This can
not be done now, as the lines attached to
the floats are liable to become entangled
in the propellers of the steamers and lo
tause considerable trouble and damage.
It was pointed out that there is a United
States statute forbidding vessels being
moored in navigable waters. %
Commodore Harrison said that he de-
Eirtd to explain his position, as he ha*Â»
lieen accused of trying to hurt the yacht
club and to serve his own Interests. Be
ini? prrscnt at a meeting of the Town
Council, at which It was stated that tho
moorings of the yachts prevented Gov
ernment vessels from anchoring off Sau-
Falito and hearing an order given to the
Marshal to arrest any yacht owners who
refused to remove their floa.ts, he asked
the president of the Council to suspend
action until the yachtsmen could be con
sulted. Adolph Sylva *aid that the yachta
rnrn. whil*> fully entitled to an anchorage,
have no right to take up space wanted for
other vessels while their own craft a-ro
out of commission. After a full and ani
mated discussion it was unanimously
agreed that if a Government vessel desires
to anchor in a spot partly taken up by a
vacht'g buoy or barrel the owner be noti
fied to remove It without delay. If this
be not done within a reasonable time the
Town Council will remove It by force.
Yesterday's meeting indicates that the
difficulty will be amicably adjusted.
Difficulties Over Moorings Will Be

Entertainment to Be Given in B'nai
B'rith Hall by the Pioneer
Club.
The Pioneer Rowing Club, In conjunc
tion with the Coopers' Union, will give an
entertainiment In B'nai B'rith Hall on
Wednesday evening for the benefit of
Jack Dunpby, an old member of thÂ»
Pioneer and Ariel Rowing clubs and a sin
gle sculler among the oarsmen of the Pa
cific Coast Becond only to Peterson. Jack
Dunphy was seriously injured in a land
slide at Nome City and, owing to a lack
of skillful medical treatment, has suf
fered the loss of one of his arms. Three
operations have been performed upon the
injured limb at St. Luke's Hospital, at the
last of which the arm was taken off close
to the shoulder. It was also necessary to
remove two pieces of bone from his Instep.
The cost of medical attendance and nura
ing having consumed Dunphy's funds, his
old clubmates have come to the rescue.
A clever amateur company, the Columbia
minstrels, has volunteered their service-j
and will be present in full force. Kel^y,
Marlowe and others will assist. The en
tertainment will begin punctually at S
p. m. and will be followed by aancing at
10 o'clock. J. Cook is chairman of the
committee of arrangements and Fred
Michels will be the floor manager.

MAHER & REID'S brlndle and
white greyhound Bad Boy won
first prize the big open stake at
Union Park yesterday, taking
an easy victory from George
Van Bergen's imported young fawn dog,
Red Angus.
Bad Boy made the going anything but
hard for himself and proved by the clever
and snappy manner in which he disposed
of his opponents that he was the best dog
in the stake. Red Angus was made a
favorite in the final, though the talent
erred in figuring that way, considering
the Individual work of thesa hounds In
the previous rounds of the stake. Sym
pathy too, was probably responsible for
the odds on, which should have boon
against the young courser. Anguu was
brought out here some months before the
big John Grace cup event, but was never
tried in a stake until then, his owner
keeping him out of minor runs for fear of
injury- '
For the first time out he performed well
and has shown an improvement In all
subsequent goes. When the doga were
slipped for the final yesterday it was seen
that heavy work had had Its effect on
Angu* and that Bad Boy was virtually
alone in the chase. The course wa.s a
long drawn out affair, a hard Jack setting
a pace too strong for the tired dogs. Re
lief dogs were turned loose, but the hare
evaded them Jong enough to pivo them
some work. Bad Boy stood the test in
good shape, but poor game Angus caved
in and had to be carried from the field,
it Is doubtful If he will recover. R. E.
de B. Lopez's Crawford Rex died last
night from the effects of a severe course
with Wedding Bells in the first round on
Saturday.

BERKELEY, Nov. 25.â With the'
Thanksgiving day varsity finally picked !
and new playing togeuier in first-class \
form the football prospects for Berkeley i
have taken a much brighter hue In the
Jast few days.
The eleven as now decided upon has j
Womble and Hudson ends. Albertson and ]
Pringle tackles. Clay and Overall guards, j
Cornish center. More rjuanerback. Gam- j
nion and Smith halves. Duden fullback. '
The choice of Overall is considered in J
every way satisfactory. The big fresh- |
man has all along been considered first- j
class varsity material, but the trouble has
bem just where to use him. He has been
vacillating between guard and fullback
ail season, playing with about equal suc
cess in each place. The loss of Stow, the
crack guard, came simultaneously with
the decision of the coaches that Overall
was hardly quick enough to play with
Gammon and Smith behind the line. So
he has been put back to the vacant place I
between Cornish and Pringle. Within the |
last week he has absorbed an astonishing
emourt of coaching and has shown such
a marked all around superiority over
O'Toole that the place has been easily
conceded to him.
Overall has a number of excellent <juali
ticB besides his gTeat weight and strength.
Ae a kicker he easily outpunts More, his
long- drives averaging forty yards and oft
en going over sixty yards. Though slow j
at starring, he is possessed of phenpmenal i
speed when well under way. This gives
him great va!ue as a ground gainer when
given the bali to run from guard between |
end and tackle. It is expected that he. |
Â¦w ith Clay and Fririgle. will star in this |
department in the big game. :
Looking up and down the Berkeley line, j
the coaches find it difficult to single out
any really weak place.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Nov. 25.â
The eleven men who are to do battle on j
the gridiron for the honor of the cardinal |
next Thursday spent the day resting
quietly. It is the first time since the days .
if Walter Camp that the football men
epent the last Sunday before the game on
their own campus. That they thoroughly
enjoyed the change was shown by the cor-
dial greetings with which they received
their fellow- students who dropped in upon
them to extend words of encouragement.
The men are in fine fett'.e. Their spirits
are high and they feel that, they are ca
pable of bringing home victory in the big
contest that is now the all-absorbing topic
in both colleges. With the exception of a
few bruises and sprains, no fault can be
found with the condition of the men. The
only wonder is that the injuries have been
so few considering the smashing prac
tices of the last two weeks. Captain Bur
nett has the worst injury. The knee
which was badly wrenched In the Nevada
game has prevented him from even run
ning through signals -with his men. He
will take his place at tackle Thursday,
but without the advantages which the
last few days' practice would have given
him. Center Rush Lee and Slaker are
both ready for active work. Left Guard
Deforests arm has recovered from the
case of blood poisoning which disabled it.
Coach Yost has plenty of work mapped
out for to-morrow. In the morning he
will take the varsity squad into the hills
for secret work. Late in the afternoon
the two elevens will be lined up for a
heavy fifteen-minute scrimmage, the last
practice of the season. Quarterback
Raitt. who was expected back last Fri
day, reached the campus to-night. His
presence back of the line will mean many
yards for his team on Thanksgiving day.
ELECT A CAPTAIN.
Harvard Men I>ecide Upon D. C.
Campbell After Yale Game.
BOSTON. Xov. 25.â When the Harvard
team returned to the Yale gymnasium aft
er the game yesterday it elected Captain
Daly's successor, who will lead the crim
son team next year. The choice fell upon
Davis C. Campbell. "02. who played left
end in the erame yesterday. .
Captain Campbell prepared for the Law
rence Scientific School at Worcester Acad
emy, where he played tackle and was
captain of his team. In his freshman year
at Harvard he played right end and cap
tained his team. Last year he played left
end on the varsity and was especially
noted for the prit that he showed in div
ine into an interference and upsetting It.
He is 6 feet 1 inch tall, weighs 170 and is
27 years old.
Harvard men feel that he will make a
good leader for the crimson eleven since
he has already captained two teams and
has had a great deal of varsity expe
rience.
Teams Are Picked and Secret
Signal Practice Begun.

STANFORD'S AX
Berkeley Students Arrang
ing a Big Football
Demonstration.
BERKELEY. Nov. 25.-One of the big
gest football rallies of the season, from
the point of noise and enthusiasm, will
be held to-morrow afternoon on the cam
pus : It will be the "ax" rallyâ the one
"ax" rally of the year. The famous Stan
ford ax which the Berkeley boys captured
at a baseball game two years ago will
be brought out.
There was some talk of taking the ax
to the women's rally Tuesday evening,
but the relic was considered too valuable
to be trusted in the open after dark. Will
P Drum, the famous sprinter who has
had charge of the ax. will carry It to
morrow. He will be escorted by the band
of (W0 rooters. During the rally Drum
will appoint a new "custodian of the ax."
a position of great trust at college.
Drum's successor will not be made known
until to-morrow, but he will be a promi

portant rally of the year.

Thomas Mayon, Superintendent of use
Apollc Mtn&u; Company, has arrived, la
Oakland, en route East, where he Is to
Interest capitalists in coal deposits In
Alaska which his company has uncovered.
Mr. Mayon Is staying with relatives at
1269 Market street. He believes that the
coal fields of Alaska will be of tremen
dous value to the Pacific Coast.
"The discovery of these beds of coai
along Chignik Bay is in my opinion one
of the 'most important finds ever made
on the Pacific Coast." Bald Mr. Mayon to
day. "For several years I have been In
vestigating the coal deposits of Alaska
with a view toward determining what
they might develop. This bed. which ex
tends for many miles along: the bay is
several feet thick. The coal is a lignite
of good quality, bituminous and appears
to be In enormous quantity. It la possi
ble, under the cenditions. to build a rail
road five miles that will bring the coal
beds within easy reach of sail and steam
craft."
Mr. Mayon will return to Alaska upon
the completion of his Eastern trip. In
the spring the work of determining the
exact extent of the fields, their depth
etc.. will be undertaken. *
*"In view of tfce decreasing: coal supply
on this coast." said Mr. Mayon, "I con
sider the discovery of these beds as of
vast commercial importance. There la no
doubt that a great find has been made

miliar with South, American affairs state
that attention Is again being given in
Venezuela to the project of the transfer
of the Island of Curacao, belonging to
Dutch Guiana and lying off the coast of
Venezuela, to Germany. The Island came
to notice during the Spanish-American
war, as it was the point chosen by Admi
ral Cervera for making a stop when his
squadron was en route to Santiago.
It is understood that the acquisition has
been discussed from time to time in Ger
many, meeting with considerable favor
and being considered J a transfer which
could be made by concession from one
European nation to another. Whether the
principle of the Monroe doctrine would
apply to territory already he!d by a for
eign government Is an open question At
present, however, the matter has not at
tracted the attention of the Government
here, nor Is It known that the German
authorities are desirous of securing the
cession, the discussion being confined to
the reports coming from South American
countries near the island in question. The
German Government recently disclaimed
any purpose to acquire the island of Mar
guerita, off the Venezuelan coaBt. and in
official German quarters here there Is no
knowledge of present attention being
given to Curacao.

VANVOTJVER. B. C. Nov. 23.âSixty
seven angry laborers are looking for
Harry Parker, a well-known man about
town, who engaged them to work for the
Stave Lake Power Company ana. they
allege, defrauded them. The Stave Lake
Power Company is preparing to supply
water power for the operation of manu
facturing plants In Vancouver. Parker
claimed to represent the company and
engaged the sixty-seven men to go to
Stave Lake, clear the ground and make
other preparations for the erection of tho
works. The laborers say that Parker
exacted a deposit from each man, levying
as much tribute as he thought they would
stand, the amounts ranging from $1 up
ward. He instructed them to be at to
day's out-going express witli their outfit*,
promising to meet them at Uie depot with
their railway tickets.
Parker did not appear at the station
and it subsequently developed that he had
left town. The deceived laborers were
especially exasperated because many had
spent all their ready money, some a*
much as $50. in purchasing outfits for the
work, which was supposed to last at least
six months. This expense waa in addition
to the lost deposit.
Parker has lived In Vancouver for ten
years. He is only 23 years old and was
formerly bookkeeper for McDonald Broth

was arrested for forging the flrm'o name

Strong In her belief that mercy must win
over justice â In this she Is like Portia
she goes with the consent of the prioress
to see the strict and inflexible ' Angelo.
He has never taken pleasure in the sins
of the Viennese, they say. therefore he
can have no pity for Claudlo. The truth
is that Angelo is a consummate hypocrite.
He was to have married a lady named
Marianna. But her dowry was lost at sea.
Then he discarded her. accusing her false
ly, in order to cover up his own dishonor
with infidelity. Marianna Is really the
most constant and pure of women. In
her lonely "moated grange" she waits day
after day ior him to keep his promise, for
In spite of his vile aspersions on her char
acter she loves him still.
This man. more unrelenting than a bet
ter man would have been, refuses to think
of clemency. He will scarcely listen to
Being a kindly man. he will see that the
ascetic and cold-blooded Lord Angelo does
not misuse his .absolute power. Th*>re
may perhaps be f need of tempering Justice
with mercy. Isabella soon learns to think
that there is. for she is disturbed in the
convent of St. Clare by one Ludo, who
tells her of her brother's Bin and his con
demnation to death. Claudlo says that
as a last resort his saintly sister must see
Angelo. Lucio puts it:
"Go to Lord Angelo *. ! â¢ .
And let him learn to know, when maidens ene
Men eive like gods; but when they weep and
kneel ,
All their petitions are as freely theirs
As they themselves would owe them."
Visit both prince and people."
"I will as 'twere a brother of your order
Goes all decorum."
The duke leads Angelo to believe that he
has gone to Poland. -but he goes to a mon
astery and persuades Friar Thomas to
to teach him how to appear and act as
friar. He says:
Morals and manners have become so lax
in Vienna under the nominal rule of the
very amiable duke that marriage is named
only in jest. And Claudlo, following the
prevailing vicious practice, has ruined his
sister's friend, Juliet. The youth of Vien
na hold such sin lightly. A woman's hon
Â«r is nothing to them because the women
themselves do not prize It. But there is
one who doesâ Isabella, the sister of this
Claudio. Chastity with her is "no nega
tive good." To fall from that virtue, even
in thought, Is worse than death to her.
She Is not ismorant, but she is Innocent.
Filled with high thoughts of purity and
faith, she has Just entered a convent. She
is not disgusted with the world, not
shocked at Its wickedness â she believes
that every sin may be repented ofâ and
not disappointed in love. She has taken
no vows; in fact, she has entered the-con
vent on the very day on which her broth
er Claudio has been condemned to death
for the evil done to Juliet. The duke,
alarmed by the growth of vice in Vienna,
has delivered the reins of government to
the strict Lord Angelo, because
â"liberty plucks justice by the nose;
The befcy beats the nurse, and quite athwart
The scene of "Measure for Measure" is
laid In Viennaâ a brilliant, gay, thought
less, frivolous and lax city. Its nobles
seem to answer to Browning's description
of the Venetians in "A Toccata of Ga
luppl's"
â"till in due time, one by one.
Some with lives that came to nothlnr. some
Â¦with deeds as well undone.
Death stepped tacitly, and took them where
. they never see the snn."
Claudio was one of these fiowerlike
young men â a butterfly, with no thought
of extinction.
The plot was not Invented by Shakes
peare. He took it from the tedious old
play by George Whetstone, afterward
printed In a prose version. It was called
"Promos and Cassandra." It was printed
both in 1578 and In 15S2. Shakespeare,
bound by the fable of "Promos and Cas
sandra," 9howg all the more his wonderful
power of transcending all limitations and
of illuminating even the improbable by
the pure light of truth. It is presumed
that "Measure for Measure" was com
posed about the year 1603; the exact date
has not been absolutely ascertained.
XIII.
"Measure for Measure" is one of the
noblest of all Shakespeare's dramas, and
yet It is seldom put upon the stage to
day. Miss Xellson was. I think, the last
representative of the postulant Isabellfiâ
that fine flower of womanly purityâ seen
in this country. It seems to be one of
those dramas of Shakespeare's which are
thought by the general public to be. a3
Dr. Johnson said, in a dialogue with Bos
well, the better for not being played. And
not having been played often and seldom
used by the public reader Its treasury of
beauty and sublimity is less known than
it should be. It is the most moral of
Shakespeare's playsâ the mo6t directly
moral would perhaps express It betterâ
and yet this very direct morality has
through the modern habit of undlvine
silence and false delicacy prevented it
from' being as much of a household word
as "Hamlet." This play, Walter Pater
says in "Appreciations," page 179. "by the
quality of these higher designs woven by
his strange magic on a texture of poorer
quality, is hardly less indicative than
'Hamlet' even of Shakespeare's reason,
of his power of moral Interpretation. It
deala, not like 'Hamlet.' with the prob
lems which beset one of exceptional tem
perament, but with mere human nature."
It is a tragedy, but. aa Pater puts it, "it
remains a comedy." The greatest element
in tragedyâ that element w~ich makes
"Hamlet" and "Lear" and the great old
Jew so awfulâ the sense of failure at the
last â Is avoided. "Plain speaking does not
vitiate," Coventry Patmore says. And as
this Is so, let us hope that "Measure for
Measure" will be ranked, as It deserves,
as one of the truest oieces of morality
ever presented, in fitting form, by any
poet.
The duke, having drunk her pleadings
with delight, sends for Claudlo, who, of
course, marries Juliet. The duke, forgiv
ing Angelo, cannot forbear a Jocular slap
at him for his insinuations against
Mariana:
'XovÂ» her. Anre!o^
I have confessed her, and I know her vtrtoe."
Isabella, convinced that her place Is In
the world, accepts the duke's hand and
the curtain falls 'on several marriages, aa
the trick of the stage required. The play
is over; but thÂ» splendor of diction, the
glamor of imagination, the appeal to the
heart, to the mind, to the essential truth
of all human life, remain forever.

A due ilncerlty govern'd his deeds

Let him not die. My brother had bat JaÂ«t!cÂ«
In that he did the thlae for which hÂ» died."
Mariana, still loves Arsrelo as the re
pentant Juliet loves Claudio. The- duke
disguised as Friar Lodowlck. who haal
after the manner of potentates In plays,
discovered what everybody 13 thinking
about, basins to disentangle the threads
He, like Anpelo. Is charmed by Isabella.
As Friar Lodowlck he persuadea Isabella
to deceive Angrelo that Mariana may go to
I the tryst at night In Anselo'3 garden
house. The trick by which t^e husband
and wife are brought together Is quite In
line with the ethics of the drama of Lope
de Vena and Shakespeare. â¢
"Nor, g*stlÂ» daughter, fear tou not at all.
He Is your husband on a pre-contract: ,
To bring yen thus together, 'tis no tin.
Sith that thÂ« Justice of your title to him
Doth flourish the deceit.
Angelo, without shocking those conven
tions which obtained until the beginning
of this century. Is married offhand by
Friar Peter to Mariana. And then Marl
ana and Isabella both plead for his life,
believing Claudio dead.
Isabella says:
Sin to Isabella is far more than death.
To consent to sin on any pretext means
intolerable degradation to her. even
though the sin were secret and her honor
untouched in the eyes of the world.
"Oh, you beast:" she cries. "Oh. faith
less coward! Oh. dishonest wretch:
â¢ â¢ â¢ Take my defiance, die, perish!"
After the highly wrought passion in the
third act the play becomes more of a com
edy and less of a tragedy. In the begin
ning of act four we are prepared for the
sweetness and joy to come by the lovely
lyric sung by the page to Marianaâ who.
by the way. is entirely a creation or
Shakespeare's. She Is so suggestive a
creation that she gave Tennyson the
theme for hl3 two pre-Raphaelite poems.
"Mariana" and "Mariana in the South."
"Whether Shakespeare or another, wrote
the lyric sung by the boyâ the rest of
which is to be found In Fletcher's "Bloody
Brother"â It is a strain of fine music
"Take. O take thoso llpa away.
That so sweetly were forsworn;
And those eyes, the break of day
Lights that do mislead the morn;
But my kisses, bring agraln, bring again;
Seals of love, bat seal'd in rain, leal'd In
vain."
In the original play, "Promos and Cas
sandra," Angelo ia altogether devilish:
but Shakespeare knew better than to
make him all evtL Like the kin? In
Hamlet." his thoughts turn to heaven,
but his heart Is with earth:
"Heaven In my mouth.
Whilst my invention, hearinc not my tong-u*.
Anchors on Isabel."
Angelo reveals his desire to Isabella.
and offers her dishonor as the- price of
her brother's life. She is masterful in
her Indignation, for she has nothing of
Ophelia in her. She will tell her brother,
Â¦who. she is sure, would die twenty times
before he would profit by his sister's fall.
At first Claudlo Is with her; his finÂ© sense
of honor Is touched by her high words;
she Is masterful again: she carries him
along with her In spite of himself; but *"
remembers that
"Death is a fearful thine."
To which Isabella replies:
"And a shamed life, a hateful.**
And Claud !o:
"Ay, bat to file, and gro we know not wtÂ»er*t
To He In cold obstruction and to rot:
This sensible warm motion to become
A kneaded clod:" and the delighted spirit
To bathe In fiery floods, or to reside

To be im prison" d in the viewless winds.
And blown with restless violence round about
The pendant world. â¢ â¢ â¢
Sweet sister, let mÂ» lire."
And you but waste your words."
Isabella in words that again remind cs
of Portia's pleaâ for Shakespeare never
hesitates to repeat the same thought, the

THE police are anxiously looking
for "Billy" Clark, alias Reynolds,
alias Williams, an ex-convict,
who Is wanted for the attempted
murder and robbery of C. A. Carl
son, a sailor. I^ast Thursday Clark met
Carlson and after plying him with liquor
took him to the Prescott house at Mont
gomery avenue and Kearny street, where
he engaged a room. To the clerk Clark
said that Carlson was his "frie^," and
that as he did not want to see him rfcbbed
he had concluded to put him to bed.
Sevrral hours later the clerk detected
the odor of escaping gas and thinking
thtrt it was caused by a faulty meter he
started to make an Investigation. Fortu
nately he happened to pass the room oc
cupied by Carlson, and discovering that
the gas was escaping from it he rapped
foÂ»- admittance. Failing to get a response,
the clerk forced an entrance and found
the room filled with gas and Carlson ly
ing in the bed in an unconscious condition
summoning assistance, the clerk had the
apparently dying man removed to the
Harbor Hospital. The usual remedies
were employed to resuscitate him but it
was not until some time afterward that
n *_ was Pronounced out of danger.
The doctors who treated Carlson, think
ing that he had made an attempt to kill
himself, failed to notify the police, not
withstanding that the sailor informed
tnem that he was tne victim of a murder
ous criminal.
After being discharged from the hospital
Carlson returned to his room and found
that his gold watch and chain, a new
pu.t of clothes and a small amount of
money, had been stolen by the man who
sought to murder him. Yesterday morn
ing: he went to police headquarters and
told the story of his narrow escape from
being made a subject for the Coroner to
Captain of Detectives Sevmour.
"Clark, the man who tried to murder
me, Carlson said, when telling his story,
'"first met me on Pacific street, near
Kearny. He pretended that he had met
me before and asked me to have a drink
Â¦with him. As I thought he was a 'good
fellow" I took him with me to 'sw the
rights,' he claiming he was a stranger
in the city. I noticed that he drank very
little and as I was intoxicated I acted
on the suggestion that I should go to bed.
I remember groinj? to the Prescott House
with him, but that Is all. When I became
conscious In the hospital I missed my
watch, which I valued very highly, as it
was a gift from a friend. On returning
to my room I discovered that a suit of
clothes, which I had bought the day be
fore, and some money, which I had left
en the bureau, were gone. Satisfied that
Clark had turned on the gas and then
robbed me I went in search of him, but
up to the present time have been unable
to locate him."
The friends of Carlson are convinced
that Clark Intended to murder him, nfter
getting him asleep and robbing him of his
valuables.

CAPE D'URVILLE. Grinnell Land. March
12, 1900.â I write this note on the chance of
Stein and Dr. Kahn reaching Upusauk ty way
of Movllle Bay. * The fall and winter passed
comfortably at Etah. without even a day's In
disposition on my part. I have husbanded my-
Belf carefully. My feet have riven me very
little trouble and now I feel that I am myself
again. I am now at the Windwards winter
quarters with the rear division. Mott and the
doctor are ahead with two other divisions on
the way to Con so. All but a few of the natives
will return at once from here, leaving a few
with me. I shall push on from Congo without
delay, perhaps by way of the Greenland coast.
I shall strain every nerve, and, God willing,
shall do my work this spring, that I may
come back this summer. I send duplicate of
this to Cape York for a whaler.
The second extract follows:
FORT CONGO. Lady Franklin Bay. March
31, 1S0O.â Just a line to g-o down to a whaler by
returning natives. I arrived here at mid
night on the Mth, 24 days from Etah. Six
and a half days of this tlma wo were held in
camp by heavy wind storms. The doctor an3
Hensen each left Etah with natives before we
arrived hero. The Journey was a tedious one
owing to the storms, but not an uncomfortable
one for me. A number of dogs died on the
way, but I had ample number for the work
aheud. Twenty-one musk oxen were killed in
eight of the fort the day before I arrived. We
have an abundant supply of fresh meat.
After resting and feeding the dogs a few
days longer I *hall go. and the other E&qulmos
will remain at the fort hunting. I am in good
condition and the Journey shows me that I arn
myself again. If I do my work this spring I
shall come back and hasten down to meet the
ship and turn back with her. I hope to writs
again by natives, when I shall send back from
some point up the Greenland coast. Dr. Did
nick wishes to be remembered.
NBTV YORK, Nov. 25.â Herbert L.
Bridgeman, secretary of the Peary Arctic
Club, to-night gave out extracts from let
ters sent by Lieutenant Peary, the Arctic
explorer, to his wife. She did not receive
them, having started to rejoin her hus
band last August, without is knowledge.
She was at Disco. Greenland, on Au
gust 20.
The letters of Peary's were carried by
natives to the camp of the Stein party at
Cape Sablne and thence conveyed to Cape
York by Dr. Kahn, who boarded the
steam whaler Eclipse on June 9 and was
landed by her at Dundee, Scotland, on the
9th lnst. Following are the extracts
given by Mr. Brldgeman:

VICTORY FOR THE
STOCKTON STUDENTS
WEST POINT. Nov. 25.â Solitary con
finement and degradation to the ranks
| were the severe punishments ordered for
trree officers and one cadet of the United
States Military Academy after a recent
breach of discipline on the two hundredth
night before commencement. The oGicera
were the most popular men in the first
class, the cadet private Is a leader of the
Â¦ "plobs" and the action of the authori
ties is strongly resented by the students.
For recent laxity in the general good or
der-nf the post punishment was meted out
as follows:
Acting First Captain Guthrie of Colo
rado, for permitting breach of order at
mesa hall and for subsequent Insubordi
nation, was sentenced by a committee of
army officers to solitary confinement and
removal of his chevrons. He was trans
ferred to Company F.
Cadet Commandant D. D. Gregory of
Missouri was sentenced to confinement
and degradation to the ranks.
Cadet lieutenant William F. Russell of
New Hampshire, for breach of discipline,
was reduced to the ranks.
Private Dowd. cadet at large, in the
fourth cadet class, was demerited and or
dered to confinement for causing a breach
of discipline in the mess hall.
Although the offense waÂ« not a grcve
one, the incident has caused the humilia
tion of three of the most popular men in
the senior class. The young men had
been awarded their chevrons as the result
of three and a half years of hard and
conscientious work.

Reference was made to similar move

which filled the capacious Trinity Metho

OFFERS REWARD FOR TRACE
OF ANDREE'S BUOYS
The Vossische Zeitung approves Secre
i tary Game's order suspending the conver-
I sion of the United States bonds on the
i ground that expansion of national bank
I notes, through the conversion of bonds to
I lower interest was oroducing an un
i healthy plethora of money and threaten
| ing excessive speculation.
According to the Frankfurter Zeitung
the syndicate of Franco-American bank
ers who were in negotiations with Swit
zerlandÂ«regardlng the ioan for railway na
tionalization broke oft the negotiations be
cause the Swiss Government wishes to
issue the loan in Swiss money and the
bankers want a foreign loan, amounting
to something between 150,000,000 and 300,
000,000 francs.
The shipments of the coke syndicate for
October reached 700,000 tons â 1 per cent
above the shipment for October, 1899. For
October the Income of the Prussian rail
ways was 128,000,000 marks, or an increase
of several million marks upon the in
come for October of last year.
All these elements combined to intensify
the reaction. Domestic Government fun.d=s
remained weak, although the decline in
them v.'as but slight, bwiss railway se
curities were heavily traded in.. Quota
tions for Americans caused Germans to
realize largely on their holdings.
The heavy Americana securities recently
eold in London and especially in New Yoric
changes the bank balances, which, in tha
view of the Frankfurter Zeitung. relieve?
the market here of ali fear or Bold ex
ports. Indeed, this journal considers it
probable that gold will ccme from New
York to pay for securities. Small sums of
foreign gold have been received at the
Reichsbank and the money market at the
beginning of the monthly settlement
shows great ease.
The Cologne Gazette claims to have au
thentic Information that many of the re
cent American offers of iron in Germany
were merely speculative, intended to de
press the shares market.
BERLIN, Nov. 25.â Uninfluenced by the
New York market3 the Berlin Bourse last
week resumed its pessimistic tone in ail
securities which were weak, coal Bhares
being particularly so, and lost all thÂ© re
cent gains. This reaction is variously ex
plained. In addition to the renewal of un Â¦
satisfactory reports from the- Iron indus
try the Agrarian proposal In the Reich
stag contemplating a tariff war. with tho
United States and the motion, emanating
from the same quarter, to intensify the
evils of Bourse law, there were depress
ing factors in the general anxiety regard-
Ing the Czar and in the publication of the
estimates of bank dividends, showing
lower returns than those of lv^tf.

First Lieutenant Albert E. McCabe of

appointed an inspector In the Forestry
Bureau.
Particulars have just been received from
Iloilo of the battle, October 30, at Buga
son, Panay, when 200 bolomen. and W
riflemen attacked the Americans, who lost
three killedâ Lieutenant H. G. Koontz,
Sergeant Kitchen and Corporal Burns, all
of Company F, Forty-fourth Infantry.
It appears that Corporal Burns was
boloed while reconnoitering and Lieuten
ant Koontz and Sergreant Kitchen were
pierced by spears while going to relieve
an*outpost. When the earrison was at
tacked by the rebels forty -nine of {he lat
ter were killed. None of the other par
ties of attacking natives made much of a
stand and the insurgents lost 103 killed all
told.
Four natives will be hanged at Dagn

IMPORTANT DISCOVERY IN
SXrBMARIlTE CABLE WORK
Rubber Insulation Resists the In-
roads of the Teredo So Trouble
some in the Tropics.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 25.â Reports to
the chief signal officer from Manila indi
cate that the War Department has made
an important discovery in connection with'
submarine cable work in tropical waters.
One of the War Department cables that
was shipped to Manila and put down for
interisland communication was of the
rubber insulated variety. The English
cable experts in the island predicted a
speedy destruction by the teredo, a sub
marine boring worm, which eats every
thing short of railroad iron that is sud
merged In the water. The English cable
with gutta. percha insulation resists the
attacks ot* this insect for only aoout a
year, and it is necessary to insert in the
cable armor a thick continuous wrapper
of copper to prevent the teredo from Dor
ing clear through to the conducting wires
and short-circuiting the cable. This cop
per protection adds considerably to the
expense of the cable without adding to- Its
efficiency for telegraphic purposes. 'It
seems, however, that the American cable
with its rubber insulation, which has been
down for two years, is still in good work
ing order/
Colonel Allen, chief signal officer in the
islands, has advised General Greely that
the cable service Is at present organized
on a very effective footing and will be
able to lay any amount of cable which
the department may see fit to ship to
Manila-

SKELETON" OF A GIRL
FOUND IN A WELL
PANA, 111.. -Nov. 25.â Much excitement
was occasioned in- this vicinity to-night
by the, finding 'of a skeleton of , a
girl, presumably 12 or 13 years of age; in
a well on the Brunot farm, four miles
north, of here. â¢ In. April of last â¢â¢Â«Â« the
body . of Jane Â» Brunot was - found ' in this
same well. ' Mrs. Brunot was murdered oy
two of her nephews, who. are now serving
life sentences in the Cheater penitentiary.
It is believed that the skeleton 1 found to.
day is that of' a young girl who disap
peared Â¦ from heji, home In Indiana two
years ago during the visit of Mrs. Bru
not'stwo nephews to'that State."

M 1 Grand Opera-house last night.
ft I It was the second popular
night and drew a large and
enthusiastic audience.
Only by comparison with the
great casts of the first and second per
formances of the opera did that of last
night seem an inferior production. The
artistic perfection and the wonderful or
chestral effects were as strong as when
the first magnitude stars were in the cast.
Plancon as the King earned the fullest
measure of applause. Dippel as Tann
hauser and Muhlmann as Wolfram'scored
distinct successes.
For the first time since the opening of
the season Miss Susan Strong was given
an opportunity in a big Wagnerian role
snd she acquitted herself creditably as
Elizabeth. Olitzka was Eln Hirt and Miss
Maxylli the Venus. Under the guiding
baton of Damrosch orchestra and stingers
were welded into a complete harmony of
sound and stage pictures.

adapted with ihe singular genius of choice
distinguishing the lioretti of all the'mu
sic dramas and fitted with .the noblest
harmonic themes In marvelous sympatny
with tbe text, the "Ring" is the hlgnest
txpression of the genius which earlier pro
duced the familiarly worshiped "Lohen
grin" and f'Tannhauser." The same ele
mental simplicity ol phrase distinguishes
the work, ine same marvelous richness of
combination, an even further splendor of
orchestration and an even stranger, closer
sympathy of theme with the emotional
essence of the moment. He who runs

"Das Hhelngold," which will be given
this evening, is a prelude to the trilogy
proper, which consists of "Die Walkuere,"
"Siegfried" and "Gotterdaemmerung,"
a story which, Chinese fashion, takes four
nights in the telling. It Is the history of
the evolution of the hero from the god.
of the oM god's downfall throueh the
rower of gold. "Das Rheingold," first of
the cycle, tells of the gold as it first ex
ists in its haimlessness and pure beauty,
the plaything of the lovely daughters of
the- Rhine.
Then the story of the theft of theRhein
gold by Albertcn, the dwarf, is told, of his
renunciation of love, by which secrlflce
only can tho cold bo obtained, of the forg
ing of the "Ring" from it, whose pos
sessor shall have all power. Then of how
Wctan. father of the gods, seizes the
dwarf and the ring, which Alberich has
cursed, surrendering it as ransom for the
Goddess of Love Frela to the giants who
have claimed the goddess as reward for
their task of building Walhalla. But the
curse clinging to the gold has affected the
god and he foresees the end of his em

of heroes which shall take the place of the
gods, and still higher, in the world's need

"The Singing Girl," a new comic opera
by Victor Herbert, Is the medium for
Miss Neilsen's talent, and press and pub
lic have been so kind to both opera and
star throughout the East that, there is
little doubt of a favorable reception. here.
Eugene Cowles, the former basso of the
Bostonians, is one of Miss Nelloen'e sup
port, while her comedians are T. H. Her
bert and Joe Cawthorne, both well known
here. Miss Neilsen carries her own or
chestra and every scene in, the opera is
specially painted for her. â¢ Â¦

Herrmann, the â¢ magician, opened what
promises to be a most successful engage
ment at the Alhambra Theater yesterday.
SInco the conjurer's last visit here he has
studied up a lot of new business, which
was- received with great applause last
evening by a large audience. . Herrmann'B
star act is the cremation of a female sub
ject on the stage and; then scattering the
ashes of the fair damsel among the audi
ence. Another clever trick consists in
filling an ordinary cask with water, then
turning . the barrel upside down, where
upon instead ot water flowing out twelve
ducks waddle out of the cask.
As usual with minstrel shows, the sec
ond part of the programme is a riot of
novelties and boisterous fun.. There are
"acrobatic singing and dancing," "sing
ing and talking comedians," and Gordon
and Hunt, novelty musicians. â¢ The pro
gramme ends with a helter-skelter knock
about turn in which Dan Waldron, Mas
ter Martin, James Connors and John Mor
ton are participants.
J. J. Cluxton, Charles Weston and
Harry Leighton sing sentimental songs
creditably, and the interlocutor, John Ro
land, is a basso with a voice that swells
out magnificently In the choruses.
Dan Allman, Master Martin and Dan
Waldron. the other end men, are black
faced comedians of ability and have a
grist of Jokes that keep the ; audience
laughing.
George Wilson is. of course, a large part
of the entertainment. Last night, in one
sketch, he wore for the first time, an ele
gant new light-colored suit, said to have
cost $275. "Waltz Me Again" Wilsoa is a
prime favorite with San Francisco audi
ences. Ho has a batch of up-to-date Jokes,
some good new songs, and a revision of
his. stump speech that is better than
ever.
The opening of the engagement was an
auspicious one and promises well for tho
success of the visit to San Francisco of
the popular burnt-cork artists.
