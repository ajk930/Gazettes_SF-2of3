BOSTON. r>ec. 26.â One of the most sen
sational episodes in the criminal line
which the police have been called upon
to handle in a long time came to a climax
to-night In the arrest of Mrs. Carrie Hun
toon, aged 26. well "known in society ard
at the time of her marriage one of the
belles of the city of Concord. N. H. Tha
charge against her Is conspiracy with in
tent to kill her divorced husband, W. C.
Huntoon, of whom it is asserted she ha3
been extremely jealous and whom of late
she apparently has hated with an Inten
sity that may have caused her mental
derangement. *Â»
Mrs. Huntoon cane into undesirable no
tice during an incident on Main street
last spring, when she seized from the
hands of a well-known young woman a
letter said to have been written to the
latter by Mr. Huntoon. At the September
term of the Superior Court Mrs. Huntoon
was granted a divorce from her husband
on statutory grounds. Among her friends
it Is said that she had often expressed
feelings of hatred toward Mr. Huntoon.
From a beautiful bride of a few years
ago her grief 'has made her haggard in
feature and emaciated in form so that she
had the sympathy of all who knew her.
It is claimed that on Monday last Mrs.
Huntoon came to Boston and in the Union
station accosted a young man-, a total
stranger, asking him if he was looking
for work and would like to earn a' dollar.
He said he was and she asked him to get
her a man to do a job for her. He asked
what the Job was and she "replied: "To
put a man out of the way." She said she
wanted revenge on this man and that was
the only way she could get it.
The police say 'that the young man to
whom she spoke was William Henry Dut
ton of 47 Linden street, Dorchester. Mass.
He made no definite answer to what she
said, and after some conversation he gave
her his address and left her. Young Dut
ton went home and told his father of the
conversation. His father sent him to the
police authorities In Boston and* they in
turn notified City Marshal Locke of Con
cord, giving the latter a description bt
the woman as Dutton remembered her.
On Tuesday, the police say, Mrs. Hun
toon came back to this city and wrote a
letter to this young man (Dutton). telling
him to come here at once, and giving
directions as to how he was to do the Job
'when he got here. This letter Dutton
showed to the police and by their direc
tions he arranged to meet Mrs. Huntoon
this evening. City Marshal Locke came
to Boston this afternoon, met Dutton and
brought him to Concord. At 8. p. m.. ac
cording to prearranged plans, young Dut
ton met Mrs. Huntoon at the Postoffice
and took her to the rear, of the State
House for conversation. Toung Dutton
claims that Mrs. Huntoon handed him a
loaded revolver and an envelope, which
she said contained a $3 bill, as part pay
ment for the job, and another envelope
as a decoy letter which was to-be* given
to Huntoon, her former husband, in order
to get him out of the house, and Into a
favorable place for the carrying out of
the crime.

USURER'S YOKE
ON CASTELLANE
OMAHA, Dec. 26.â It is now known
that Pat Crowe was seen in South
Omaha scarcely twenty hours be
fore the abduction of Eddie
Cudahy. On Monday night. De
cember 17, a well known citizen of South
Omaha conversed with him for nearly an
hour. Just before he departed Pat was
questioned concerning his future plans
and laughingly replied:
"Oh. I have something big on; you'll
hear from me soon."
At the time this was viewed as an Idle
boast.
The mystery of finding the pony at Pa
cific Junction, twenty-five miles south of
Omaha, haa not yet been cleared, those
trying to identify the -pony as the one
used by the kidnapers being unable to de
cide whether or not it was the same ant-
Tlie police, however, are Inclined to the
belief that there is importance in the re
port coming from St. Joseph, Mo., Etat
ing that Pat Crowe had been there as
late as Monday and Chief of Police Dona
hue is now investigating that report.
Should It prove true, the Chief believes
It probable that Crowe is now In that vl
Â° ST^JOSEPH, Mo.. Dec. 26.â Five more
rinkerton detectives arrived In the city
to-night from Chicago to ferret out the
Counsel for the Count Ex
poses the Methods of
Wertheimer. NS
PARIS, Dec. 26.â Before the first civil
tribunal of the Seine to-day Maltre Bouat
resumed his speech, begun December 20,
when the case was adjourned for a week
in behalf of Count and Countess de Cas
tellane in the suit of Charles Werthel
mer, a London bric-a-brac dealer, to re
cover payment for articles sold to the de
fendants. In an elaborate argument
counsel set forth the counter claim cf
the CaBtellanes, who demand a reduction
of the debt, provisionally estimated to ba
at least 2,000,000 francs, and the restitu
tion of objects taken in exchange by Wer
thelmer under the penalty of 1000 francs
for each day's delay in the restitution
from the day of judgment, finally claim
ing damages to the amount of 300,000
francs.
Counsel suggested that experts be ap
pointed to Inspect the articles involved
and suggested that these experts be
chosen from an ..ordinary list or from
among the presidents of the cxpos.^on
Juries. He explained that George J.
Gould of New York, in aiding the Castel
lanes In this suit, de&ired to accomplish
a duty which the court had previously
conflded to him, while the Castellanes,
after throwing off Werthelmer's yoke,
brought the case Into court because they
thought publicity was better thaft the
mystery of the susoicious pacts < and
equivocal arrangements. In so doing,
counsel asserted, they did an act of dig
nity and courage. *:..
Maitre Foucald. counsel for Werthel
mer. replied, saying that the authenticity
of only five articles of the value of 500,000
francs could possibly be. questioned, and
while Werthefmer affirmed their genuine
ness he would consent to another expert
examination with. the understanding that
if the articles were declared spurious the
600.000 francs was to be struck out of tha
bill, but If they were oeclared genuine the
Castellanes were to pay the full price,
no revaluation being admitted. Wertnei
rner, counsel added, opposed the restitu
tion of the art works which the Count de
Castcllane gave him In pledge for pay
ment of the total of the bill on tho eve
of his departure for America.
Maltre Bouat again spoke, asserting
that the Castellanes obtained delays tn
payment ajid.the withdrawal of AVerthei
mer's suit only by fresh purchases of ar
ticles for 250.000 francs., which were bare
ly worth 15,000 francs. This, counsel
claimed, was selling uelays at usurious
rates. The Castellanes, counsel continued,
demanded an expert valuation of Â¦ all the
purchases and not of a few objects.
The case was adjourned until January
9, when Judgment will be delivered.

BUDYABD KIPLING LOSES
SUIT AGAINST PUBLISHER
Author May Hot Regulate the Pub
lication of His TJncopyrighted
Works. '
NEW YORK. Dec. 26.â Judge Lacombe.
In the United States Circuit Court to-day,
denied the appeal by Rudyard Kipling's
attorneys to restrain E. W. Fenyon from
publishing and editing sections of his
work upon which an elephant's head had
been used. Judge Lacombe said Mr. Kip
ling had not established a common law
trademark and there was no suggestion
of a statutory trademark.
"The proposition advanced," said the
court, "is that an author whose mental
productions, prose, verse and title, have
been given to the world without copyright
so that any one is free to reprint and sell
the whole or any part of them, may never
theless regulate the manner In â¢whifch such
printed matter may be grouped and en
titled and may restrain any application
of the title selected otherwise than as he
used or uses it. It would seem that the
measure of relief which authors may ob
tain against unauthorized publications of
their works must be found In the copy
right statutes."

Â«. R: .T.' -Wilson . & : Co.'deny that Johnson

the making. of the Pack & Everltt agree

of December he did give a written notice
demanding that ~< the .- partnership be dis
solved. _Â¦ / ; ' ' ' â¢' Â¦'Â¦ ".. Â¦Â¦ .,--.-â¢Â¦'.
The origin of the* Bult was the purchase
in 1834 by the defendants of the Detroit
street railway system, , after which Mr.
Johnson became associated with them In
the management. R. T. Wilson & Co.
began the purchase of the concern in the
fall of 1894 and after they had succeeded
in. bo doing they brought In Mr. Johnson
as an associate in January, 1895. He was
to have Â¦ a one-fifth interest in the com
pany of a41 stocks purchased or to,bÂ«?
purchased by R. T. Wilson & Co. in con
nection with the carrying out of the pro
ject for the Bonsolidatlon of all the sur
face railroads in and about Detroit. Mr.
Johnson was also to have charge of the
working of the different roads acquired
and was to act as the president of tha
company at a salary of $10,000 a year. R.
T.' Wilson & Co. were to have the man
agement of the financial -affairs of the
corporation and were to form syndicates
and outside arrangements with regard to
the " securities as they deemed fit. The
contract between Johnson and R. T. \\I1
oon &Co. was to terminate within three
years if possible, but did not so terminate,
and was extended from time to time until
November last. The reason of the failure
to close the agreement was the formation
of a new company : f or : the acquisition of
the Detroit street railroad system, | other
wise known as the 3-cent fare combina
tion, which waa engineered . by the firm
of;Pack &Everitt, who secured a fran
chise on making a stipulation that they
would carry ' passengers for a 3-cent . fare
and ; who succeeded . in acquiring between
fifty and sixty mileB of streets under that
franchise.. â¢ . ;
â¢ The scheme of Pack & Everltt seriously
Interfered with the ulans laid down: by
R. T. '-Wilson & Co. and they made a set
tlement with Pack & . Everltt: In lSJM
whereby Pack & Everitt agreed to deposit
70 per cent worth, of stock- in the 3-cent
fare company and were , to | receive in re
turn certain stocks in a new company, to
be orranlzed under the laws of Michigan.
Pack & Bverltt,' however, did not deposit
the full amount *of -70 per, cent ;Â¦ of the
stock In, the 3-cent fare company and thÂ«
question of the balance , was made a basis
of ; negotiations; as- was also the amount
R.; T. Wilson &. Co. should pay for the
stock already deposited. .These negotia
tions continued until the middle of. No
vember; last and; on November 24 an ar
rangement was made between R. T. Wil

After they had gone some distance the
nur6e became suspicious and alighted
while the vehicle was in motion. She
went at once to a telephone and Informed
Miller" that she thought something was
wrong. He went to the Union station in
order to head them off in case it was Mrs.
Miller's intention to leave the city. Up
to a late hour to-night not the slightest
trace of Mrs. Miller and child has been

New York, and every effort is" being made
to Intercept her before she, reaches that
city.
When Samuel Miller arrived at hla de
cision his wife refused to accompany him
to this city, and has continued to reside
in New York. While the young couple
have not been living together, there has
never been any talk of divorce and no
papers have ever been filed to that end.
Two or three days ago Mrs. Miller came
quietly, to this city and had two or three

LI>TCOL.!C. Nebr.. Dec. 26.â The annual
banquet of the Jeffersonian Club of Lin
coln held to-night at the Lincoln Hotel,
brought tog-ether nearly 300 representative
mm of the Democratic and Populist par
ties of Nebraska, together Â¦with a number
of leaders from other States.
The dinner Afforded an opportunity to
Wtliiam J. Bryan to make his first ap
pearance at a public gathering since the
election, and tlie greeting accorded him
was never eurpassed in point of hearti
ness in his home city. Ills address re
ceived the closest attention and the ap
plause was frequennt. He said in part:
At this banquet, surrounded by nelRhbors
vho have been my friends for years, I may be
I'triJoned lor raying a word of a personal na
ture. Five tim<-s you have voted lor me for
public offices â twice for Cotagress, once for the
I nited States Senate and twice for the Presl
dtneyâand no candidate ever received more
lcyal support than you have given.
Whether I fhall ever be a candidate for'of
fice again is a question which must be deter
rr.ired by events. No one can Epeak with cer
tainty of the future, for one's destiny is not
known until his life's work is complete. I
fhall be content if it is my lot "to aid in the
triumph of the principles while others enjoy the
honors and bear the responsibility of office.
The holding of public position should be an
incident and not the aim for the citizen. It
chould not be an end, but the means for the
accomplishment of a purpose.
The Presidency seemed desirable because it
â¢would have enabled me to give effective aid to
certain reforms which I believe to be necessary
to the public welfare, but- defeats-even a sec
ond defeatâ <5oes not lessen my interest in this
reform, and time may prove that my work -Is
to advocate rather than to execute.
The Commoner will give me an opportunity to
participate in i>ublic discupsions and I am
ture that an editorial i>OK:tion will furnish as
much Intellectual enjoyment as I could have
found in the 'White House, and in addition
thereto give me more time for home pleasures.
The principles for which we contended In
the last campalpn still live, and we who be
lieve In them must continue to figrht for them.
An election does not -change principles. It
only determines what principles shall be for
the time being applied. The believers in tariff
reform did not abandon their faith when the
high tariff doctrine was indorsed at the polls;
neither did protectionists when their cause suf
fered loss. The advocates of the gold standard
continued the fight , for monometallism for
twenty-fl v Â« years in f=!iite of the platform
declaratlii.s of all parties in favor of a double
Ftandard. Fhall we, who believe In bimetal

With nearly all advertised catarrh cures
It is a matter of guesswork as to what
you are taking Into the stomach, as the
proprietors, while making all sorts of
claims as to what their medicines will do
are very careful to keep it a, close secret
as to what they really contain.
n^w Is . one reason why Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets have been so widely recommend-
ed, because they are not only pleasant and
convenient to take, but the patient also
knows he Is not putting Into his stomach
anything of an Injurious character
These tablets Â»re sold by druggists ev-
erywhere in the United States and
Canada at 50 cents, for complete treat-
ment and probably there Is no better rem-
edy ever devised for the permanent rare
of catarrh, whether located in the hearl
throat, bronchial tubes or in the Btomaffi
.The cures that Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets have accomplished in old chronic
cases are little short of remarkable, and
the advantage of knowing just what you
are taking Into your system Is of para-
mount Importance when it is remembered
that the cocame or morphine habit -has
been frequently contracted as the result
of using secret catarrh remedies, as so
many of them are well known to contain
these injurious drugs.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets meet with" the
approval and cordial support of physl- 1
clans because their antiseptic character
renders them perfectly safe for the gen-
eral public to use and their composition
makes them a common sense cure for all
forms of catarrhal trouble.
â¢ Â¦ ; . New Catarrh CurÂ©. ' y
Tho remarkable success and popularity
of the new catarrh cure, Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets. Is largely because It not only
cures catarrh, but because catarrh suf-
ferers who use these tablets know what
they are taking into their systemsâ no se-
cret is made of what they contain. . They
are composed of hydrastin, blood root,
g-ualacol and red gum, are pleasant to the
taste and, being dissolved In the mouth,
they take immediate effect upon the mu-
cous lining of the throat, nasal passages
and . the whole respiratory tract.

GOOD REASON FOR IT.

Higglns, the demented young rancher who
on the morning of December 4 murdered
his aged mother, Mrs. Anna Hlgglns, and
their man-of-all-work. William Sheehan,
at theJr ranch In Coldwater Canyon, was
this afternoon tried for insanity by a lun
ecy commission. His demeanor was quiet
and respectful, but his answers to ques
tlcns were vagne, rambling and some
times absurd. The commission, after
hearing the evidence, decided to send Ilig
gins to the asylum.
One of the examining physicians declared
that the man Is undoubtedly insane and
has the delusion about the transformation
of bodJes firmly fixed in his disordered
mind. There is said to be little hope that
he can ever recover bis normal condition
of mind.

WICKERSHAM CASE
MTJST BE TRIED
JudgÂ« Burnett Hands Down Opinion
Denying Motion of Plaintiff
for a Dismissal.
SANTA ROSA. Dec 26.-Judge Burnett
to-day handed down an opinion In the
Cora Wickersham vs. Fred A. Wicker
sham case, denying the motion of the
plaintiff to dismiss the action brought to
set aside the $2S,000 agreement alleged to
have been made between the late Frank
P. Wickersham, in which he relinquished
all his right and title to his father's and
mother's estates. The arguments on this
point were presented on briefs by the
respective counsel a few days ago and
the following is Judge Burnett's opinion:
"The court undoubtuily possesses the
Inherent power to dismiss the action ton
motion as contended by plaintiff's coun
sel, but a different procedure is contem
plated by ' the provisions of the code. It
provides that an action may be dismissed
by the plaintiff himself, by written re
quest to the clerk who filed the papers
at any time before trial, upon payment of
costs, provided a counter claim has not
been made or affimatlve relief sought by
the cross complaint or answer of the de
fendant. Subdivisions 3, 4, 5 and 6 provido
for the dismissal of the action by the
court. The case at hand does not como
within any of said subdivisions.
"As I understand the matter affirmative
relief Is sought by the cross complaint
and answer of the defendant, although
in my opinion the cross complaint fails
to state a cause of action. There Is a
prayer, however, for affirmative relief
and an attempt, though insufficient to
Justify It by an allegation of adequate
facts. In view of the attempt to state a
cause of action, after reading briefs of
counsel. I am not prepared to say that the
action to dismiss should be granted. The
result sought by the plaintiff, of course,
can be reached by a demurrer, unless It
Is possible to bo amend the cross com-,
plaint as to obviate the objections that
have been made to it. I shall not deter
mine that question until it Is regularly
presented. The motion to dismiss is de
nied." " v -

Mrs. Metson Files Suit for Revocation
of the Probate of the "Will
CT.ATTYTS THE ESTATE -
OF LATE JOHN H. OPFER
Submitted.
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 26.â Mary Jose
phine Metson, wife of Attorney W. H.
Metson of San Francisco, has filed a pe
tition In the Superior Court of this coun
ty f6r the revocation of the probate of
the will of John Henry Opfer, who died
December 1, 1899, and also for the revoca
tion of the letters of administration
granted to Public. Administrator S. B.
Smith on tho ground that a later will has
been found.
The petitioner states that there Is no
next- of kin, and that she Is the sole de
visee. The estate Is said to consist of
personal property amounting to 525,000.
Letters of administration, with will an
nexed, were granted the Public Admin
istrator December 29, 1899. The will ad
mitted to probate was dated October 1,
1880, and gave all the property to Opfer's
sister, Anna Katharlna Schler, living in
Auchbaugh. Germany. Reuben Kerchival
was named as executor. Mr. Kerchival
died some eight years ago. '
The Opfer estate Is about ready for
distribution and Public Administrator
Smith had planned to submit his final ac
count within a week or so.
The sister to whom reference Â¦was made
in the will probated died before Opfer and
left no children. Two people somewhere
In the East, who claim to be a nephew
and niece, have recently filed a claim to
the estate. Mrs. Metson, who files the
petition, is the daughter of Reuben Ker
chival. Opfer, It appears, lived with Ker
chival for some time prior to his death.
At the time of the probate of the will
now on file It was asserted that another
will had been made, but a search failed
to bring it to light.
Thieves Visit a Clubhouse.

through. This section was â¢ thoroughly
ransacked. A desk was broken open and
$12 50. taken. Heavy sliver plate and other
valuables were overlooked. If the bed
chambers upstairs had been reached the
booty would have reached hundreds of
dollars 'in cash, besides valuable Jewelry,
as the club Is the home of many men of
â¢wealth. Entrance was effected by break-
Ing a lock on the back door.

Mrs. Teitz Charges Three Seattle
Surgeons With Carelessness in~
Performing Operations.
SEATTLE, Wash., Dec. 26â As a result
of the death of Charles Teitz, a laboring
man who died in this city last March after,
undergoing a surgical operation, a suit
brought in the Superior Court by his
widow against the surgeons who attended
him is-now before a jury. Mrs. Mary A.
Teitz, the widow, sues to recover $15,000
from John Witherspoon, G...V. Calhoun
and A. B, Bailey, all prominent practi
tioners, on the ground that had it not
been for wrong methods Teitz would have
recovered.
Teitz was taken ill last March and was
attended by Dr. Witherspoon, who de
cided that an abdominal surgical opera
tion was necessary, as the man's condi
tion was very bad. He performed the
operation and later found that owing to
complications the patient was not recov
ering. Dr. Calhoun and Dr. Bailey were
called and the three performed a second
operation. This proved unsuccessful and
after a short illness Teitz died.
The complaint alleges that the first
operation was performed without the use
of anesthetics, which greatly weakened
the patient. The second operation was
improperly handled In that the anesthet
ics were not given in the best way and
the surgerywas unskillful. Shortly after
this occurrence and after some further
work by the surgeons Teitz expired.
Mrs. Teitz alleges that at the time of
her husband's decease, or up to the time
of his illness, he was constantly emploved
and supported her and their children. She
asks the sum stated for loss of his so
ciety and as damages for the loss of in
come furnished by him.
Â¦.The answers made by the defendants
are separate and deny the allegations
concerning Improper treatment and sur
gery. â¢

Walden was a man of splendid educa

and rounded out by a life of study. He
was a civil engineer and expert account
ant, a chemist' and thorough machinist
and a . splendid architect. At the prison
he was invaluable. He drew the plans
and specifications .and superintended the
placing of the machinery in the Jute mill.
It Is believed by others of his friends
that he may have left to begin life anew
in some country where he can bury his
past. Although apparently happy it is
thought that he longed to take this step.
He stayed at San Quentin for years be
cause there he had no explanations to
make. Every one knew the story of his
life. Thus he worked faithfully as a free
man in the prison where he had been pun
ished. It is believed by some that he
tired of his life at last and resolved to
begin life anew in some foreign land, pos
sibly Mexico, a place of which he often
talked.

to San Quentin prison. Rumor has it that
his fall from grace was occasioned by too
strong a regard for the fair sex, upon
whom he lavished his own and other peo
ple's money. With an ear to the past
many to-day shrug their shoulders and
hint that wherever .Walden may be If he
did' not leave his happy home for a wo

bers could swim and might easily have
reached the shore in safety, but would not
desert his drowning companion. He man
aged to hold up and gain an insecure hold
on the slippery bottom of the boat.
The third member of the party struck
out for the beach and reached It. The
struggles of his brothers in misfortune
caused him to ask for assistance from the
large assemblage of . people along the
beach, but not one could be found who
would venture to swim out with a line,
and, exhausted as he was, the boy rustled
up a line and plunged In again with the
Indignant protest. "If you fellows won't, I
will." The spectators were about as much
rattled as Woodward, and when the boy
was* half way o'ut those on the beach who
had hold of the shore end of the line let
go and he had nothing to do but swim
back.
In the meantime Chambers, nearly
ready to go under himself from exhaus
tion, had managed to keep his partner
from drowning, but It was a desperate
struggle. When about ready to sink he
realized the boat had drifted in to where

whether or not they can or will purify
the moral atmosphere. From expressions
of prominent citizens to-day It Is evident
that a climax has' been reached.

attempts to cover twenty-eight square

casion a policeman was actually held

A committee of the Chamber of Com
merce was appointed to confer with
Mayor Humes and acting Chief of Police
Meredith to demand the protection of law
abiding people, and to declare that, failing
to secure such protection, the citizens will
take the law in their own hands. The
committee appointed consists of John
Schram. C. J. Smith, former president of
the Pacific Coast Company; Josiah Col
lins, a leading attorney; Wi R. Forrest,
banker, and E. O. Burden, capitalist.
Members of the committee declare that,
failing to secure satisfactory assurance
and performance by the city officers, they
will faVor Schram's plan for vigilantes.
and will call a mass meeting of citizens to
decide on further action. The action of
the chamber to-day places the sanction
cf the best men of the community upon
the fight begun some weeks since "by the
Volunteers of America and the Salvation
Army, who. from their methods, are
brought In direct contact with all the vic
ious elements.
To-day's session of the chamber was one
cf the liveliest ever known In the history
of that organization. There was but one
opinion and that to the effect that some
thing must immediately be done to re
deem the city from the hands of thugs,
highwaymen and burglars that infest it.
But there was some difference of opinion
as to the best method of achieving the
desired result. John Schram, an old pio
neer and leading merchant strongly
urged the formation of a vigilance com
mittee, and granting authority to even'
honest citizen to carry weapons. The
cÂ«nse of the chamber seemed to favor
Schram's plan, but it was thought best
to first take up the matter with the city
authorities, insisting on the enforcement
of existing laws.

Bladder troubles most always result from
a derangement of the kidneys and a cure is
obtained quickest by a proper treatment of
the kidneys. If you are feeling badly you
can make no mistake by taking Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp-Root, the great kidney, liver and
bladder remedy.
It corrects inability to hold urine and scald-
ing pain in passing It, and overcomes that
unpleasant necessity of being compelled to
go often during tha day, and to get up many
; times during the night. The mild and tho
extraordinary effect of Swamp-Root Is soon
realized. It stands the highest for its won-
derful cures of the most distressing cases.

In the "bucket shop" cases in which W.
D. Valentine, M. Burke, H. Muller and A.
Pritchard were defendants, the judgment
of the lower court finding them guilty
was affirmed, one of the Judges dissenting,
and at Attorney Collins" request a stay ot
five days was granted, as he announced
that he would take the case before the
Supreme Court. Valentine was fined $300
in the lower court and each of the oth
ers $100.
Chief Sullivan and Attorney Coffey, who
specially prosecuted the cases, were de
lighted with their victory.
"I expect that the defendants," said the
Chief, "will now appear in court in ac
cordance with the stipulation and plead
guilty in all the remaining cases and pro
out of. the business. I consider that the
constitutionality of the ordinance has
been pracically tested, but if the defen
dants want to test it in the higher court
they can refuse to pay the fines and be
imprisoned. Then a writ of habeas corpus
could be obtained to take the matter be
fore the Supreme Court.
In the case ol John Rlley.' a clerk In
Harry Corbett's poolrooms, the Judgment
of the lower court was reversed on a
technicality.
In what is known as the "San Jose"
case, in which the defendants were Harry
Corbett, "Walter Mclnerney and James
Daly, a petition on their behalf for a re
hearing was denied, and the remlttltur
was ordered sent forthwith to the lower
court. The point in this case was as to
whether a bet wired from here to San
Jose was" actually made in this county or
In Santa Clara County. It was held that
the bet was made in this county.
A part of the agreement was that two
cases should be tried on their merits
without a jury with the object of deciding
as by the evidence and the law as to what
constituted a pool, and- if there was a
pool transaction. The cases selected were
those of George Duncan and Harry Cor
bett. The former, was tried before Judge
Cabanlss and the latter before Judge Mo
gan, and In each case a conviction was
had and a nominal fine of $23 was im
posed. Briefs were submitted on the cases
on appeal and also In the case of Harry
Corbett and Joseph Mohan, charged Joint
ly, and who had been convicted and fined,
the former $300 and the latter $100. Yes
terday Judges Lawlor, Cook and
Dunne, sitting In bank in Judge Lawlor's
court, gave their decision on these cases,
affirming the judgments of the lower
courts. Attorney Collins, for the defen
dants, asked for a stay of five days, but
it was refused and the remittiturs were
ordered sent to the lower courts at once.
The poolsellers .will now go out of busi
ness entirely if they will abide by the
agreement made between them and Chief
Sullivan that in the event of the Supe
rior Court deciding against them they
would close up their places and plead
guilty- In all the remaining cases, about
twenty-five in number, still pending In the
police courts.

POOLMEN MUST GO
OUT OF BUSINESS
NEW YORK, Dec. 26.â Many turfmen
discussed Sloan's case, yesterday. It be
ing brought into prominence again by h's
riding Vesuvian ;at the Tanforan track
on Christmas day. The fact that Sloan's
license Is not revoked is generally ac
cepted as the real reason why the Tan
foran authorities permitted him to ride,
and there is no doubt that had Sloan ac
cepted a mount on an American or Eng
lish jockey club course he would have
been allowed '; to fulfill his engagement,
but the advisability of his doing so Is se
verely questioned. As a prominent turf
man said yesterday:-
Tommy Nelson and Dave Hanley fought
four rounds for a draw. Hanley didn't
care to fight any too much and Nelson
didn't know enough of the game to do
any better.
Charles Hawley took Â¦ â¢ Harry Bowers'
measure ;in one round. The men Â¦ agreed
to fight according to Queensberry rules.
HawTey. with his left wrapped around
Bowers' neck, used his right on body and
jaw and Bowers went out in a heap.
Half a round was enough for Pat Welch,
who fought Jimmle LJttle. Welch caused
the referee to work his .finger at him
twice. The second time it was all over
and he lay on the ground thirteen sec
onds.
Jack Hawkins was a ringer and Joe
Burns, who thought the man he was to
meet bore the name of the programme,
was sadly disappointed. Hawkins was Joe
McCarthy and one round and a half per
suaded Burns that he was In but not of
the mix-up. In the second round Burns
went down and out for more than ten
seconds.
Archie Dean and Nobby Otts went three
rounds of heavy, eklll-less fighting. When
neither boxer could raise either arm at
the end of the third round the police
stepped In and Referee McDevitt pro
nounced the contest a draw. Dean had
Otts all but out three times.
Billy Kelly lost control of his top works
in the fourth round with "Indian" Joe
Gregg and this lost him the bout. Up to
this stage of the game the fight was fairly
even, but the "Indian" finished at a fast
and strong pace, while Kelly weakened
and was left to straggle In. The referee
gave the aborigine the decision.
Kid Malone and Frank Neil started the
game. Malone' s seconds threw a towel
into the ring before the first round was
nnished and Nell was the winner.
The heavyweight event between Jim
Griffin, colored, and P. J. Maguire. white,
which concluded the entertainment, lasted
but a short fraction of a round. Maguire,
with a physique that reflected a steam
beer sign, was hit full In the jaw and he
spun around like a top. He went out from
a similar punch.
The Bay City Athletic Club gave Its last
of-the-century fistic show last night txi
the club rooms on O'Farrell street. There
were eight bouts In all. few of which went
the limit.

next year would be so small that It would
not enter Into the argument. On the
other hand, the fact that he is riding is
as much as saying to the English Jockey
club, 'I can do as I please this year: your
edict does not go Into effect until next
season.' "
The Earl of Clonmel, a well known turf
man and breeder of thoroughbreds, anJ
now In this city, was asked what he
thought about the Sloan case. He said:
"I think Sloan would have been much
wiser to have kept in the background, at
any rate for the present, and If he be
haves himself In a quiet, unostentlous
manner for a year, there Is no doubt ha
will be granted a license again. He
brought this thing on himself by his man
ner of living and His barefaced effrontery.
It was common talk that Sloan was bet
ting and if his application for a new 11-
The United Milk Producers* Association,
a company owned by the farmers and
dairymen who ship milk to this market,
went into a receiver's hands In Septem
ber. Its assets and liabilities were ap
proximately $200,000. The Old Town Bank
held much of the company's paper, and
Mr. Wllcox. its cashier, was appointed co
receiver. At a meeting of the unsecured
creditors to-day It was i decided to con
tinue business under plans submitted by
a finance committee of the stockholders
several days ago.
The bank was chartered by special act
of the Legislature In 1858. Its authorized
capital was $150,000. The president Is E.
G. Shipley.
Both the firms mentioned in the bill of
complaint are in receivers' hands.
"The bank admits that, by reason of the
facts stated in the bill of complaint. It la
no longer able to meet its current obliga
tions, and, believing that It ought not to
further undertake to continue to do busi
ness but that Its assets should be held for
the mutual benefit of all persons Interest
ed. It consents to the appointment ot sl
receiver or receivers as practiced."
"Rumors affecting tbe financial condi
tion of the bank are In circulation in con
sequence of which large sums of money
have been withdrawn by depositors, and
it is a question of. but a short time when
the bank will be compelled to close its
doors. The bank 13 unable to pay Its lia
bilities In the usual course of business,
and unless a receiver Is appointed It will
result in a struggle to keep the doors of
the bank open and depositors will suffer
loss."
The answer, filed by President E. Q.
Shipley, la as follows:
"While the bank, until a recent period,
has done a successful and profitable busi
ness, it has recently incurred heavy losses
by the bad faith of its cashier. Theodore
S. "Wilcox in that, without authority he
wrongfully, without the knowledge of its
president or board of directors, permitted
Isaac Robinson and the United Milk Pro
ducers' Association to draw from the bank
large sums of money and Incurred losses
thereby which the bank la unable to bear.
George Schilling, a stockholder and de
positor, and Robert T. Gill, a depositor,
were the complainants. In their state
ment to the court they say:
BALTIMORE, Mfl., Dec. 28.â Roger T.
Gill was to-day appointed receiver for th*
Old Town Bank by consent of the presi
dent and officers of the bank. Mr. Gill
gave a bond in the sum of $1,500,000. the
assets of the institution being valued at
half that amount.

cense had not been refused iomethlng
worse would have happened to him. j
think he was let off very lightly and I
do not think anything more is meant than
a warning. Sloan must learn hiÂ» place
as a jockey If he wants to ride In Eng
land again, and I am surprised that h*
has been tolerated as long as he has."
Foxhall Keene, who leaves for England
on Saturday, thinks that under the cir
cumstances Sloan d'.d no harm by rfdlns
at Tanforan. As his license Is not re
voked he considers he Is In good stand
ing until he applies for a new license and
is refused.
Colonel Thomas Ochlltree expressed sur
prise that the Tanforan authorities should
have permitted Sloan to ride, but a: th3
same time he did not think that the'r
permission would have any effect on the
case when It came before the Jockey club.

SAN JOSE, Dec. 26.â The dissatisfaction
among the -prune men over the present
policy of the California Cured Fruit As
sociation has led to the calling of a joint
meeting of the directors of the associa
tion and the California Packers' Company
for to-morrow morning to see what can
be done to improve the condition of the
market. Â¦- The demands of those growers
who want an allowance of differentials on
large sales and a reduction of one cent
a pound on the four-size basis, will be
given special attention and discussion, and
those prune men have been requested to
attend and present any ideas they have
in regard to a change of policy.
So far as can be learned, the directors
of the Cured Fruit Association do not
favor a reduction in prices or a change
of presidents. Directors of both the PacK
ers' Company and Cured Fruit Associa
tion 6ay they have differed at times with
President Bond's policy, but they consider
It a lamentable exhibition of weakness
and- one liable to defeat the whole object
of the two organizations to cut prices or
make a change in management right in
the middle of the selling season. They
look upon the .movement started by the
handful of dissatisfied growers as ex
tremely unwise and lamentably demoral
izing to the market. They consider It the
work of two or three men who have
grievances against the management ami
pOlnt to the failure of these dissatisfied
growers to obtain signatures to the paper
they are circulating asking for Bond's
resignation 'or a change in policy.
The hotbed of dissatisfaction appears to
be in'the Berryessa district.' They claim
there Bond is too arbitrary and imperial
istic. They think "the prices too high, dif
ferentials to European countries antagon
istic to Eastern buyers,. and believe large
buyers should get a discount.
. A good share, of the criticism of the
management of . the i Cured Fruit Associa
tion comes from the business men., of this
city, who are displeased . with the condi
tion of the local trade because of a lack
of ready money, on the part of the prune
growers. The holiday , trade suffered , on
this account, and accounts- at stores are
going longer unpaid than on previous
years.'' ".-' Â¦ Â¦"' Â¦. â¢ ' Â¦ ' -â¢Â¦ Â¦ -.â¢"'-* ;>

!. Mrs. Gladstone testified that she understood
defendant was a millionaire, and there seems
to have been a struggle of avarice between
the plaintiff and Mrs. Walker;' the latter to
secure . Boardman for her Â¦ daughter and the
former, to secure him for herself. That either
of these matrimonial - schemes should have suc
ceeded is pitiful, but the plaintiff seems to
have been overmatched in the unseemly race,
end while she might have made defendant a
better mate than his child-wife there is no sat
isfactory evidence that he ever promised to
wed her. The burden of proof was upon plain
tiff to establish the promise and she has whol
ly failed to maintain it. A new trial Is there
fore granted. : .
: That this septuagenarian suitor should affect
such pensive melody and sad sentiment as
Balfe's composition afforded seems inconsistent
with the blissful season of courtship; indeed,
his entire conduct toward the plaintiff gives
more evidence of senility than romantic ardor.
Subsequent to the- marriage of Mr. Boardman
and his present wife Mrs. Gladstone . called
upon the defendant's bride and congratulated
her upon her marriage in the presence of at
least two , witnesses. The mother cf defend
ant's present wife, Mrs. Walker, also testi
fied to the same effect; but In the consideration
of the case I have utterly discarded her testi
mony because all the evidence herein serves to
show that she was a sordid womanâ a woman
who In consequence of the defendant's wealth
was willing to wed a daughter IS years old to
an Infirm. . decrepit and feeble man of over
three score years and ten.
Evidence to support the material fact of the
promise was strangely lacking. . while much
testimony was offered on both sides relating to
matters of minor consequence, such, for in
stance, as the testimony ot plaintiffs daughter,
who-was called to prove that. defendant once
asked her to play on the piano "The Heart
Bowed Down." and that he had aald to her
that a picture of , her- mother was a fine one.
lira. Gladstone at the date ' of th* alleged
promise to marry was 62 years Â¦ old and the
defendant 74. The plaintiff had been twice
married and had a family, of which seven
members survived. Two of her children lived
with her and yet, bo far as the evidence dis
closes,'she never revealed to either of them the
fact of her engagement, j Neither does I it ap
pear that she ever â¢ mentioned Â«uch engage
ment to any of her friends, neighbors or. asso
ciates, or to any person whatsoever.
Defendant's formÂ«r wife died on February 20,
1899. On June 20, 1899, he married Blanche
"Walker, a girl only IS years old. The plain
tiff read of this marriage the following day
and although she saw the defendant afterward
â¢he never reproached him for his ' failure to
keep the Â¦ alleged promise, nor .did she allude
to such promise ' in - any manner whatsoever.
Aside from her own testimony there is no evi
dence that she made ! any preparation for
the weddingâ no time for the ; nuptials was
fixed; no correspondence was had; no gifts were
given or exchanged.

ciation was organized on July 7, 1S3S. a.nd
that a constitution and by-laws were
adopted on July 14 of the same year. By
the constitution and by-laws members were
prohibited, under renalty of expulsion,
from Felling to or buying from any per
son, firm or corporation not a member of
the association. The direct consequence
of this agreement, the court said, is to
restrain commerce between the States.
The testimony showed further, the court
added, that since the association was or
ganized the prices of the products have
been increased two or three times. "It is
a monopoly of trade, and as such Is pro
hibited by the act." The only question
for the Jury to decide, he said, was the
amount of damages that the plaintiff had
actually suffered. The court would multi
ply that sum by three. - i ',â¢"?â¢

It will be noticed that the Governor says
he has. not had occasion to use Pe-ru-na
for other ailments. The reason for this is.
most other ailments begin with a cold.
Using Pe-ru-na .to promptly cure colds,
hs protects his family against other a:i-
ments. This Is exactly what every other
family in the United States should do.
Keep Pe-ru-na In the house. Use It for
coughs, colds, la grippe, and other clim-
atic affections of winter, and there will
be- no other ailments In the house. Such
families should provide themselves with a
copy of Dr. Hartman's free book, entitled
"Winter Catarrh." Adress Dr. Hartman,

victim?. Pe-ru-na not only cures catarrh,
but prevents. Every household should bÂ«?

coughs, colds and so forth.
Â¦ ;.The Governor of Oregon Is an ardent
admirer of Pe-ru-na. -He keepa It contin-
ually In the house. In a recent letter to

Any man who Â¦wishes perfect health

."A throws 11 at a raffle. C bet B will
beat it and B throws 11. Does C lose his
bet or win it? Answerâ C loses, the tie
not answering to his proposition. The 11
was thrown before the bet was made, and
to beat 11 it is manifest a higher number
must be got. But when a man says be
fore a throw, 'I'll beat you,' a tie makes
the bet a standoff. Thus, if -A and B
throw dice and C in advance of the throw
pays, Â¦ 'I bet that B will beat A's throw."
then A takes the converse of C's proposi
tion, and bythe acceptance of the wager
bets that he (A) will boat B."

spondent writes: "A bets B that he will
beat him in any shake of dice he may
throw. B' shakes Â¦ three sixes and A
Shakes three sixes. A claims that he did
not lose." The correspondent does not
state if this was a single throw with
three dice, but presumably it was. If that
wai the case it was a foolish bet, for A
must have known that there was a possi
bility of B throwing- three sixes, the high
est-possible, and that he could not possi
bly, beat that throw. The law governing
dice-throwing is laid down by Hoyle In a

Cur Growing Navy.
While these developments of the- last
sixteen years have been taking place the
TJnlted States haa moved upward from,
near the bottom of the list of the world 3
naval powers to tha fourth place; and in
actual warfare the United States navy
haa earned a distinction which has put
its vessels Into the first place among the
warships of the world. Except for Japan,
which did not build her own navy, Ameri
can vessels alone of the vessels of mod
ern navies have been put to the test, and
have given the world proof of their capa
bility and power. The achievements of
the American navy have gone into his
tory. But it is not always kept in mind
that the building of the navy has had
its part in the creation of an industry
which in the early years of the new cen
tury must inevitably become one of th>
foremost industries of the country.âBOS
TON TRANSCRIPT.
Important to Italy.
The announcement . that the Queen of
Italy will in a few months become a
mother Is of great importance in the af
fairs of that country. The hope of both
the royal pair and the people will proba
bly be for a son, and if It shall be real
ized the rejoicing? will be unbounded.
Such an event indeed will go far toward
strengthening the throne. The King is a
delicate man, and the fear has been tnat
there would be no issue from the mar
riage, and this has depressed both lha
King and all the friends of his house.
But a son, and especially if he shall show
the reinforcement of the maternal blood
and rive promise of vigor, will enlarge all
the calculations of the house of Savoy.
The arrival, we may be sure, will be cele
brated far and wide throughout Italy.â

fact that "a majority of the voters of the

fact that "the Republican vote showed

Considering the commerce from the per capita
standpoint, the contrast between the import and ex-
port figures is even more phenomenal. Following the
records of our commerce back to 1870, it is found that
the imports when considered in the light of. the actual
population have decreased rather than increased/while
the per capita of exports has enormously increased.
In 1870 the population was 38,558,371 and the imports
$461,132,058, an average per capita of $11 96." In
1880 and 1890 the per capita was a little over. $13; in
i 1895 it had fallen to $11 47,' and in 1900 will be about.
$10 oo.^ On the export side the showing is even more
striking. In 1870 the exports per capita amounted;
to $10*46; in 1885 to $12 26;-ini8ob to $13 69, and in
1900 will be'about $19 42. Thus the imports show =
since 1870 a slight reduction per capita, while the ex
ports have almost doubled per capita during the same
period. v ;
Gratifying as is the showing made by those figures,
it does not tell the whole story, for considering the.
balance of trade, from the per capita standpoint, the
development startling. In 1870 imports exceeded ;
exports by Â¦$57,546,048, and the excess of imports qw
exports amounted to $1 50 per capita. By 1875 'the
balance had turned in our favor, but amounted to only
17 cents per capita. By 1885 it amounted to $1 79 per
capita, and in 1900 will amount- to about $8 50 â¢per
REPORTS from Washington are to the effect
that the commercial statistics of the year will
show that the exports of the United States and
the balance of trade in their favor are greater than
ever before in history. In other words, we are to
close the last year of the century with a degree of
commercial prosperity, that in some respects would
have been considered marvelous had it been predicted
a decade ago. '
The reports say that basing the estimates for thi
year upon the eleven months' actual figures already
received by the Treasury Bureau of Statistics, it
seems probable that* the exports of the calendar year
1000 will reach about $1,476,000,000, and the imports
$825,000,000, making the excess of exports over im
ports, or favorable balance of trade, $645,000,000, a
sum greater by $25,000,000 than that of any preceding

WASHINGTON, Dec. 26.â R. G. Lincoln
of San Francisco is at the National.
It is "to be noted, moreover, that recent reports
fromlSouth Carolina show that the business is prov
ing profitable in these good- times. It is .said the
State orders for December included 2500 barrels of
whisky, - and ; a single Pennsylvania factory has been
given a contract for 150 carloads of flasks, which will
make the largest shipment of. merchandise ever sent
South. .Tillman is not much of a? statesman, but he
seems to : have' scored well with his dispensary policy.
From that statement it. appears ; the > only notable
difference" between the British 'plan and that in force
in South Carolina is that the j British propose to fur
nish liquor through state dispensaries to restaurants,
while under Tillman's plan the dispensaries deal di
rectly with, the. consumer. ' A
The London Chronicle in "discussing certain plans,
which Lord Grey has for "uniting temperance" reform
with national profit" says: "His idea is that the pub
lic house may at once"be made less harmful than it is
to the individual and a source of revenue to the na
tion by conducting it in the interests of the state in
stead of in those.of the private publican.
these reformed conditionsthe public house would be
a house of refreshment where alcohol could be ob
tnined in its natural proportion to other articles of
food and â¢ it would not be a % mere drinking
bar, as it now is, and it would not be to trie in^ereot
of the manager to push unduly, the salerof intoxicants.
Any profits derived would [ be administered for . the
public benefit. This is a move in the direction of
sanity and common sense, and. would be an improve
ment indeed on the -Gothenburg system."'
GREAT BRITAIN is about the last place in the
- : English speaking world in which we would
expect to" find followers of the policies of
Senator Tillman, and yet it appears likely a serious
effort will be made at the coming session of Parlia
ment to establish state dispensaries for the sale of
intoxicating liquors, the scheme to be carried t out
on lines similar to those which Tillman adopted in
South Carolina. .

PERSONAL MENTION.
The pledge provided in the bill is almost identical
with that of the act of 1897, but it is coupled with the
requirement that the voter shall write his name
opon the roster stating the party whose ballot he de
sires to vote. Finally election officers are to be al
lowed a nominal" compensation of one dollar a day
to avoid any question as to the constitutionality of a
law compelling a citizen to render service to the pub
lic without compensation.
Such are the essential elements of the bill. The
clause giving to independent voters the same privi
leges as may be exercised under the act by political
parties is designed to meet the objection made by ths
Supreme Court in the recent case brought before it
The measure appears to have been carefully consid
ered and to accord with all constitutional require
ments. Whether it should be enacted as it stands
can be determined only after full discussion upon all
bilfs designed for the like purpose which may be in
troduced. Every feature of it should be attentively
studied. California is in great need of a sound pri
mary election law, and the Legislature should be
careful to make no error this time in enacting one. v
The character of the measure may be estimated
from the following summary- Separate ballots are
provided for separate parties, and it is provided that
ts many ballots for different conventions may be pre
pared as the committee of any party may desire for
that party, so that if it be desired to have candidates
to State, district and county conventions elected upon
one ballot it may be done. The ballots of each party
are to be of a color different from that of another
party. Independent \oters are to have the same
privilege of holding conventions as members of po
litical parties. In the election of delegates to county
conventions not more than three precincts can b:
consolidated to elect delegates independently of
other precincts, but in conventions where more than
â¢one county is concerned the delegates may be elected
by Assembly districts.
In preparing his bill Senator Devlin has followed
the general lines of the act of 1899. In noting the
changes he has found it advisable to make he says:
â¢"I have endeavored to simplify matters by proceeding
on the theory that the Election Commissioners
should appoint the primary election officers, who
should receive the ballots at the primary and count
the same, leaving out all reference to State conven
tions, district conventions and local conventions, as
such matters should properly be left to the commit
tees of the respective parties. * * * In the law
o f 1809 there was aoparently no provision made for
the election of delegates^ to a State convention to
choose delegates to a national convention, and I have
endeavored to cover that point."
SENATOR RO3ERT T. DEVLIN of Sacra
mento has prepared for submission to the Leg
islature a bill providing for holding primary
elections under the supervision of the law, and as the
issue is to be one of the most important to be dealt
with at the coming session, he has very properly
furnished copies to the press in order that it may be
discussed and thoroughly understood not only by the
legislators but by the public as well. His action in
that respect merits commendation, for there exists
a danger that bosses and others who profit by frauds
at the primaries will be prompt to take advantage of
any opportunity to procure the enactment of an ade
quate law, or of one that would be declared invalid
by the courts.
FOR HONEST PRIMARIES
Not since the time at Nauvoo, when Brigham Young overcame rivalry and be-f
came the head of the church after the killing of Joseph Smith, has there been any
doubt as to the right of succession. The theory of the Mormon Church is that the
Lord Inspires the .Twelve Apostles in the naming of the church president, but in
variably the. presiding apostle has been chosen, and the presiding apostle has been
the senior one in term of service in the quorum- of the twelve, as the apostolic
organization is called. So heretofore it has been simply a formal matter to desig
nate a new head* of- the twelve Or a new head of the church. But when Apostle
Richards, the president of the twelve, died a few months ago, he bequeathed an
ecclesiastical problem to his brethren.
The president of the church has two counselors, who are chosen from among
the apostles. /Their apostolic functions are suspended while they act as counselors,
but if when their chief dies his successor does not retain them they go back to
their seats among the apostles. George Q. Cannon and Joseph F. Smith are the
counselors of President Snow. -Cannon became an apostle in 1860, and Smith
reached the apostolic rank in 1867. But Brigham Young, son of the prophet, -was
ordained an apostle by his father's favor in 1855,, although he did not become an
actual member of the apostles' quorum until 1868, after Cannon and Smith had
taken seats in it. and he claims seniority, with the right of succession, on the
ground of his earlier ordination.,
'When the apostles were confronted with the duty, of selecting, a chief on the
death of Richards, they evaded a decision of the question of succession involved
by leaving the position of president of the twelve vacant. To take the place George
Q. Cannon would have been compelled to retire from his present position. In which
he is regarded by many as virtually the head of- the church. On the other hand,
the elevation of Brigham Young would have been a concession, according to prece
dent, of his claim to the church presidency. So the failure to select a chief apostle
is regarded as on the whole indicating the preference of a majority of the apostles
in behalf of Cannon. But Young and his adherents hope that his name has not '
yet lost its power to conjure, and that the favoritism shown him by his father will
have strong influence in compelling recognition of his claim..
ONLY the life of a feeble old man, according to latest advices from Salt Lake
Â¦ City, is between the- Mormon Church and a crisis affecting 1 the succession
to its presidency. Lorenzo Snow, the present head of the church, Is 86
years of age, and the state of his health gives his people frequent appre
hension and causes consideration of the question as to his successor.
Speaking at Glasgow recently upon university ques
tions, Lord Rosebery is quoted as saying that for
university work of our time an institution founded to
day has an advantage over one founded in the fif
teenth century. No doubt in those ancient institutions
there is much in; the way of historic association to
stimulate earnestand noble young minds, birt to
stimulate to scholarship and to supply scholarship are
two different things. The r student needs iniore than
venerable halls and their memories oi great names.
He needs an up-to-date plant and first-class men to
instruct him in making use of it.
Out of the moral of this experience of old Scot
land young California can draw a lesson useful at
this time. .If a university so renowned as Edinburgh
cannot hold its own without an increased revenue;
surely we" cannot expect â¢Berkeley to compete with
the great universities "of the United States without
adequate income. At Berkeley there is no lack of
students. On the contrary, there are more than the
university can' properly care for, but that large at
tendance will not continue unless the university be
made equal to their rightful demands. The bill pro
viding for an increased revenue to the university
ought therefore to receive* aj willing support from
every legislator. It is one of the measures that should
certainly be enacted this winter. _
old schools is the lack of money. That lack prevents
them from providing a sufficient number of profes
sors and maintaining an adequate plant. Experience
is teaching them that Stanford was not hopelessly ab
surd when before founding his university at Palo Alto
he sought information as to .what a first-class univer
sity plant would cost. ? '
According to ' the reports that come to us, the
cause of the decline in attendance at these : famous
The years since those days are few, and "yet already
the most conservative and self-sufficient of universi
ties have learned that they have a plant, and that if it
be not kept'up to date the results are serious. Among
the universities that have learned that truth it ap
pears those of Scotland are to be numbered. Those
venerable institutions are not holding their own in
the world; they are not drawing students as they did
in former years. At one time the medical department
of the University of : attracted students
from all parts of America and /Europe, but the num
ber is now greatly diminished. It has : been recently
announced that the number -of medical
at the university has fallen in eight years from 2025
to 1 147. A similar decline in the number of students
is noted, moreover, at the universities' of â¢ Glasgow,
Aberdeen and St. Andrew's. '.- In fact, the Scottish
universities are confronting a crisis. So far Â¦ from,
drawing students from other lands, they are hardly
holding their own.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF UNIVERSITIES
WHEN Leland Stanford was going about the
country . studying the problems of university
, foundation and getting all the information he
could as to the best course to pursue in founding
the great institution he. had at that time in contem
plation, there was a story to the effect that, he' asked
President Eliot of Haivard what his "plant" cost-hint.'
Whether the story be true or false it caused a good,
deal of merriment in the East and wasToften cited as
a proof that great business magnates cannot under
stand the difference between a seat of "learning and a
factory. There was supposed to be something absurd:
in the supposition that Harvard had a "plant" and
that its value could be estimated in money. :
capita. ;Thus in the thirty years' the -balance of trade
has gone from a minus quantity of $1 50 per capita
to a plus quantity of $8 50 per capita, v -
: Such is the record of our commerce during the last
year of the nineteenth century. It sets a high mark
of prosperity for the twentieth century to attain and
surpass. We have reached the foremost place in the.
commercial .world as well as in the industrial. Our
trade * is now the greatest among nations, * and when
once we have built up an American merchant marine
sufficient 'to the needs of this vast commerce the do
minion of the seas will be ours.
The presence of such criminals and tie commission
of such a crime in this country may well stir our
people to thoughts of the imperfection of our civili
zation.
Our laws to punish abduction are very lenient.
They have been framed down to a current idea of
what that offense is. It is regarded as a charge that
may lie against the sighing stripling who elopes with
an old man's daughter, or against a divorced husband
o: wife who skips with the children. The Cudahy
case should remind State Legislatures, of which many
are to meet this year, that a statute should be framed
to punish abduction end demand for ransom. We
believe the penalty should be death, since the, crime
can be made productive to the criminal only by- the
threat to murder or inaira the prisoner held for ran
som. ; ;.; Â¦-â¢ ; ;_;
It is to be hoped that Mr. Cudahy has found such
trace of the gang that took his boy as will result. in
the capture of the miscreants, though they cannot bs
adequately punished.
Mr. Cudahy has taken steps to detect the criminals.
But if they are found the laws of Nebraska furnish no
punishment for the crime.
This case had very dramatic details. The father
received a letter directing him to drive over a certain
read, alone, at night, with a red lantern on the.dash
board of his buggy, and when he came to a white lan
tern to leave the money there and drive away. He
obeyed instructions, took the lonely drive with the
goÂ© in his buggy, and in a brief time the boy was
dropped near home from a close carriage.
The case of the Cudahy boy, at Omaha, has excited
great interest, and all the detective intelligence of
the country is watching it. The father was warned
that his boy's eyes would be put out with acid if he
did not deposit a ransom of $25,000 in gold coin. He
paid the money and the boy was returned, safe and
sound.
They have means cf getting information about the
bank accounts of their intended prey, and .seem to
prefer fat English bankers, of the Cheeryble brothers'
type, for whom they receive an average of Â£6ooc
apiece. When the ransom is not forthcoming on th
first demand it is their rude custom to cut off an ear
of the prisoner and send it down to his friends duly
authenticated by himself over his own signature as
his ear. Along with the ea"r goes the information that
il no cash is in sight by a certain date" the other ear
will be sent down. The last ear is sure to come, too,
unless there is a payment. When the ears are gone
these pleasant people send down the nose, and have
been known to send also a finger at a time. They re
gard this pruning of the captive as the cutting off of
interest coupons on the amount they demand.
Their habits are so well known that the friends of
a captive generally lose no time in raising the money
required to secure a release.
The industry has .vaned of late years through the'
habit of the .Governments concerned of holding the
locality responsible and cutting off a few heads in the
neighborhood. This has proved salutary, and adipose
bankers are safer on the mountain roads of Italy and
Greece than for some years.
But as the industry has waned abroad it has waxed
here. Our bandits <lo not lie in wait by the moun
tain roads. They do not infest thinly populated but
picturesque sections rought by tourists for their
scenery. Their trade is plied in large cities. The first
noted instance of this horrible form of crime was the
kidnaping of Charlie Ross, the infant son of a rich
man in Philadelphia. The bandits offered to return,
him for $20,000 and no questions asked. But the po T
lice persuaded Mr. Ross that they could recover his
boy and no ransom v.tcd be paid. It is said that he
was also actuated by the feeling that if he yielded the
success of the wretches in getting money would not:
only encourage them but their imitators to commit
the same crime against other fathers. But he never N
saw his child again, and, after spending his fortune
in a vain search, died not long ago, a broken old
man. It is believed that the kidnapers killed the boy
and made way with his body to conceal the evidence
of their crime. Several other cases of the same kind
have occurred. The only noted case of the capture
of a ; grown person occurred in this city three 3*ears
ago. A rich Hawaiian planter was lured to.impris
onment in a house in a thickly populated part of the
city. He escaped after several days' confinement, and
his captor was identified and is now' serving a sen
tence at San Quentin.
THE world has long been entertained by tales ot
the sins of bandits in Italy and Greece who
make a^business of kidnaping travelers'and
holding'the same for a ransom. These bandits are
usually on good terms with the_ country people, upon
whom they sometimes bestow largess, and from whom
they occasionally recruit their ranks for an expedition
that requires an unusual force.

The branch of the W. C. T. U. In charge
of the work among soldiers and sailors
on this coast helped to make Christmas a
day to be remembered by five ' hundred
soldifrs in the hospitals and barracks of
the Presidio. It has been the custom for
some time for the ladles to 'write letters
to soldiers and sailors â letters of hope and
comfort and advice â and for the purposes
of Christmas members of the union all
over the State were asked to write, and
forward letters to the headquarters In
this city. Five hundred, letters came in,
and into each envelope with the letter was
put a handkerchief and a Christmas card,
and these 'each -with a little bunch of
flowers were taken out to the Presidio
by several of the ladies of the union and
?:rre distributed.

Brown went Into the grocery on the
corner and told of his experience. A few.
minutes, later Policeman Roedlger, who
lives in the neighborhood, entered the
grocery and the robbery was reported to
him. "Roediger notified police headquar

detailed on the case.- He saw Brown, who
was unable to give an accurate descrip

Brown said his watch was a valuable

There has been a lull in the depreda

The victim was C. Brown, - 423 Turk

returned home shortly before 1 o'clock
yesterday morning and as he was-jjhout

"Ypu had better take them," replied
Brown.

The Bay City Wheelmen held their
Christmas tree last evening at the club
house on Golden Gate avenue. The rooms
were crowded' early in the evening,' and
until late last night members kept coming
and going, . getting :Â¦ a present from the
tree, a bumper of punch from the dining
room and then joining the chorus beside
the piano.
George B. Stangenberger dealt out the
presents. They were trinkets suggestive
of some personal "peculiarity, some event
or some deed .of Interest or amusement
connected with the member honored. Then
followed a~ programme of entertainment
in which Austin Kanzie, A. Fisher, Ben
Renard/ Henry L. Day, Frank Smith, Ar
chie Reid and others took part. The clos
ing of the programme did not by any
mean3 end the evening, however, for when
the list had been run through, the mem
bers Improvised more and more, and until
far Into the night the clubhouse rang with
the laughter and the merry choruses that
shook the ceilings.

first convention. The members are H. F.
Lyon, Alameda; J. H. Severin, Modesto;
George E. Newman, Lompoc; E. H. Zim
merman, Watsonville, and William H.
Roussell, San Francisco. The purposes of

makers' employment bureau, to hold con
ventions for the exchange of ideas and
methods, to conduct exhibitions of butter,
to act in union In the butter-maker's wel
fare and to secure better compensation
for services. William H. Baylor, at 114
California street, is one of the prominent

ization and outlining its future policy and
work.
The first association of . creamery men
to be organized west of the,Mlasouri River
will be formed next Wednesday at a
meeting to be held In this city. Fifty men

"William |M. Bunker and wife have re
lumed from a journey around the'world.
They left San - Francisco twenty-two
months ago, and, during "their : absence
â¢triivoled .. ih!ny-fivfc" : tliuiisand miles,
lietilth attended them en an theii J-}ur
neys by land and sea.
j- Mr. Bunker having adjusted his. busi
ness aft airs : for a', long trip, started out
to see the world, and especially tne. world
of the Orient. Accompanied 'by ms wife,
he Journeyed ' by rail trom ~ \iadivostoK

in a verucle'diawn uy horses, . arriving
at irkutsAhi nne torm. Tne rest of
the -journey . oy run 10 'Moscow and St.
Petersburg was interesting, but not ex
citing.
In nis travels in Asiatic regions tribu
tary to the Pacific Mr. BunKer studied
the currents of commerce and the proba
ble btnetlts to loan Franclaeoy springing
from the growth and development of Rus
sia in Asia. . He saw many 'things to ex
cite his wonder and surprise. When the
time comes he, will report* his observations
to the fcan Francisco Chamcer of Com
merce. -â¢ \- -
bpeuking of trade expansion, he says:
"I am in favor of subsidies for building
ships and establishing steamship lines. 1
care not who makes the money, so Â¦ long
as we get. the commercial advantages
within our reach. The Spanish war was
in one sense a great business investment.
European nations had no adequate notion
of the strength and vigor of the United
States until the operations of the cam
paign opened thelreyes. An Englishman
remarked to me: 'xour President went
to wur In a business way that we cannot
understand. He ordered . the army and
navy to deliver so many victories and
they were delivered promptly.' " . ' - .
Mr. Bunker loitered in London for eight
months and made no haste In his travel
through Continental Europe. He collected
fragments of building material from an
cient edifices and had the specimens so
collected shipped to the University of Cal
ifornia, where the study of the chemistry
of structural, material may be leisurely
pursued* Mr. Bunker paid for the pack
ing and also the freight charges to Liv
erpool. One of the ships belonging to
John D. Spreckels Bros. & Co. is convey
ing the specimens free of cost to the uni
versity from Liverpool -to San Francisco.
Mr. Bunker was the founder of the San
Francisco Dally Report. He learned of
the paper's demise before he returned to
the city. He is convinced that the penny
proposition as applied to journalism will
not succeed In San Francisco until the
city has direct connection with the East
by four 1 or five railway lines. When he
sold the Report to the Scripps ' League
he expressed doubt as to the ability of the
new management to achieve success on
the penny, basis. -: >'.,-. .

"and 'went f upstairs 10 have -Christmas

He fairly revels in appreciation of the
pathos of his fall; he compares his past
career to that of glistering Phaeton, and
announces that he is ready to exchange
Hla subjects for a pair of carved saints.
And his large kingdom for a little gtave.
He plays his part In the great abdication
scene with perfect, grace, and retires to
prison, hugging his sorrow as the dearest
possession left him. But even yet he has
not learned the stern lesson of life. He is
no Henry VI, to live content within a
cage; he broods over his wasted life,
curssa Bolingbroke, strikes his keeper, and
dies in a fierce outburst of useless courage
against his murderers.
Henry IV, Is the very opposite of Rich
ard. He has no claim upon the throne ex
cept the claim of a strong man in a weak
land. He is essentially a man of deeds,
not words, though he knows when and
how to speak. From the beginning his
hopes are fixed upon the throne, not from
ary merely selfish - ambition, but with
something of the skillful pilot's eagerness
to seize the helm from the hand of the
madman who is driving the ship upon the
rocks. Each act is calculated with refer
ence to this end steadily held before him.
He wins the hearts of the Commons by
Judicious mingling of courtesy "and re
serve,: 'he gains the affections qf the no
bles by appearing as their * champion
against Mowbray, the King's instrument
in the murder of the Duke of Gloster.
When he invades England at the head of
an armed force he Is careful to explain
that he comes only to claim his rights,
and it is not* till the general voice of the
nation summons him to the throne that
he reveals his - long-hidden ambitions.
There Is much to admire in Henry's char
acter, and perhaps his finest quality is
his care for his kingdom. He crushes his
old limbs once more into armor to stamp
out a rebellion of unruly Lords, he par
dons and. condemns, not out of personal
mRlice, but in accordance with a wise
policy that makes for peace, and the one
fear of hla old age Is that under the wild
rule of his headstrong son his poor king
dom will turn a wilderness again. But
after all he is not Shakespeare's model of
the perfect king. There is too much of
the leaven of selfish ambition in him. too
great a partiality in his policy for by-
Richard III, with all his astonishing
powers, 'is. a comparatively simple char
acter. Shakespeare next turned to the
portrayal 'of the. far more complex nature
of Richard II. and here we find him work-
Ing, .not. In the broad manner that he
Â¦ learned . from 'Marlowe, but slowly, touch
by touch, with infinite delicacy. The de
lineation of this character must have been
to . him a ; labor of lo\-e, for Richard II,
like Shakespeare himself, was a poet. He
has all a poet's, love of lovely ;words, ap
preciation of splendid or pathetic scenes,
and distaste for the harsh realities of life.
When he is forced to act he does so has
tily and rashly, as though eager to get
the tiresome business oil hi3 hands, reck
less of consequences if only he may drop
back into esthetic appreciation .of the
part he plays, for Richard II. unlike
Henry VI, enjoys his kingly place. No
other of Shakespeare's klng3 has so fine
a feeling for royalty or such fine words
to voice his feeling In. Unlike the kings
we have hitherto mentioned, Richard
rules by divine right and undisputed suc
cession, for he is direct inheritor of the
eacred blood of Edward III. From his
boyhood he has been surrounded with flat
terers, wno tilled his ears with praise?
of his state. Even Jonn of Gaunt, the
relic of a more heroic age. speaks of him
as God's substitute, his deputy, anointed
in his sight. But it was this very confi
dence in his unchallenged authority that
proved the ruin of Ricnard. He was not
naturally cruel or tyrannical, but he for
got the duties of royalty in dwelling over
much upon its outer forms. He kept too
great a court and gave too liberal largess,
and when his cotters were drained he
pulled the Commons with grievous taxes
nnd laid heavy fines upon the nobles. He
stopped his ears to counsel 'and grew fu
rious when It was thrust upon him. And
so. when the storm broke, he had nothing
but words to meet It with. He threatens
Bollngbroke with God's vengeance on
usurpers and proclaims with lofty confi
dence that
Not all the water In the rough, rude sea
Can wash the balm from an anointed king.
But at the first news of his enemies' suc
cesses he cries to his friends:
For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground.
And tell sad stories of the death of kings;
How some have been deposed, some slain in
> war.

Company to handle heavy weights that
come in on the cars or are received for
shipment was wrecked by the fall of an
eighteen ton gun carriage that broke its
tackle yesterday morning. The gun -car
riage was for one of the new disappear
ing guns in the Presidio batteries. It
had been lifted from the car and was
being swung over the truck that was to
take it out to the Presidio when the hoist
ing chain broke and the" carriage came
down on the truck, smashing the latter
to- pieces, and then rolled, over against
the> derrick and wrecked It. There were
five men working around the derrick at
the time, Jwt with the exception of one
they escaped without injury. The fifth
man was struck on the elbow by a piece
of the derrick- and the small bone of the
joint was fractured.
paths and crooked ways. And Shake
pea re was too much a man of his time
to pay whole-hearted homage even to so
great a usurper as Henry IV.
Â¦~ Henry V closes the trreat series of
histories, and !n the figure of the hero
of Apincourt Shakespeare at last realizes
his ideal of kingliness. For this he pre
pares ua by the most careful development
or Henry s character as a Prince. We
hear of him before we meet him. and we
hear of him at his worstâ a reveler in the
London taverns, a companion of a disso
lute crew, reckless In word and deed,
we first meet him. he Is movfef In
the fellowship of Sir John Falstaff/lanr
est and most genial of loose livera and
â¢ lawbreakers, surely the most dangerous
of intimates for a gay young Prince. But
Henry knows himself and knows his
company. He has no mind for the stiff
ceremonial of his father's court, and he
has the English love, testified In many
an old sotg and story, for jolly company
and, rough fun. If he takes part in a
highway robbery It is only for the sake
of a jest upon Sir John, and he scrupu
lously makes good the stolen money. He
answers his father's rebukes gravely and
reverently and promises to redeem his
faults on the heads of his father's ene
mies. He keeps his vow. and the battle
of Shrewsbury is the turning point of his
career.
In the second part of "King Henry IV
we find him but once in PalstafTs com
pany, and then under circumstances so
overwhelmingly 'amusing as to excuse
him utterly. And this. is his last freak of
youth, \rhen we see him next it is by
his father's deathbed. He does not look
forward to the crown with joy or pride,
but assumes it gravely as his due with,
the solemn resolve to guard it against thi
world and to transmit it to his son un
impaired.
So before he ascends the throne the
character of Henry has been molded by
mingling with the world, and learning
at first hand the realities of life. In tho
Play that bears his name there is little
or_ no evolution of character, but on the
other hand there is a very elaborate por
trayal of 4Â»ls kingly qualities. Almost ev
ery virtue is ascribed to him. yet he is
no impossible hero, but a very human
man and Englishman. In the first place
he is possessed of a quick Intelligence,
and has the faculty of mastering what
ever subject comes before him. Bishops
wonder at his discourse In divinity, and
he unties the gordian knots of statecraft
as easily as his garter. He has a keen
insight into the hearts of, men and known
how to choose a servant; the upright
Judge who had sent him to prison in his
wild-oats days Is retained near his per
son when Kalstaff is banished ten miles
from the court. He ts deliberate and pru
dent in counsels and swift as lightning
in their execution. His will is dauntless,
but his temper Is sunny and serene. The
wild gayety of his early years has soft
ened Into a genial humor that wins him
all hearts, and below his humor lies a
deep religious feeling, not the other-world
liness of- the. mystic but the simple piety
of the soldier who prays to the god of
battles for success and ascribes his vic
tory to God's hand. Around Henry rally
the representatives of the British king
domsâ Jamy the Scotchman, MacMorris
the Irish engineer and Fluellen the hot
headed "Welshman. The greatest nobles
of England accompany him to France,
and York, who had years before plotted
treason against Henry's father, falls in
the forefront of Â£he battle at Agincourt.
Henry Is the Idol of his people. Only
once does treason raise its head against
him. and this one attempt he crushes in
stantly with such an awful mingling of
wrath and sorrow that the traitors break
down before him and go repentant to
their doom. Henry seeks no revenge for
the attempt on his person, butâ and tbto
a characteristically Elizabethan touch
treason toward . the sovereign is consid
ered as an attack on the nation, princes,
peers and subjects. And those who have
sought the ruin of the realm are deliv
ered up to suffer the penalty of her laws.
It has been pointed out with truth that
Henry V is a limited and finite hero. He
has not Hamlet's capacity for thoughts
that wander .through eternity, nor Othel
lo's seallke ebb and flow of passion. Â¦ But
as a master of life he is infinitely beyond
either Hamlet or Othello, and it is as a
master of life that Shakespeare shows us
the perfect king. Not of. his own life
only, but of the life of thousands wh6se
wellbeing depends on his right action.
The great scenes on the eve of Agin
court should be read and reread, and stu
died line by line by every one who would
grasp Shakespeare's conception of the
born leader of menâ the king who Is at
once the heart and head of the nation he
rules, leads, inspires and represents.

NE"W Â£ ,TORK.-Dec. ,:6.â The - metal <Â¦- market
was entirely; nominal ', to-day In the 'absence 'of
Nezv "York Metal -Market.
A feature of . the business of the j year has
been the Increased substitution of i cotton ; for
wool, and a preference for the medium or lower
grades of wool as distinguished from the fine
grades. As to the business of ; the past week
lt Â¦ has presented but few features of interact
calling for special mention. The 1 demand has
been as large as waa expected in a holiday sea
eon, and has run principally. to Territories' un-"
washed . fleeces and scoured 'â wools, > The : sales
amount to about 2,600,000 pounds and represent
Quite a large number > of transactions. ~ Prices
while favoring the I buyer, I are | not I sufficiently
changed to ; warrant ' any general ' lowering . of
Quotations. - A :hopeful feeling 1 pervades the
trade < that with - the ; turn of â¢ the year an im
proved demand/for wool will set in. which will
have the effect of lifting -the markets from its
present : condition Of lethargy. Thin feeling iÂ»
naturally strengthened . somewhat by . the con
tinued favorable advices received from abroad "
The sales of the week in Boston amounted to
2,168,700 Â¦ pounds , domestic and Â¦--, 335,000 pounds
foreign, waklnr * a t total of . 2,503.700 pound*
against a total of. 3. Â£00,000 pounds for. the pre
vious week and a. total of 2,3Â£O,OOO pounds for
the ' corresponding i week , last , year. ' .-Â¦ The ; total
eale3 since m January - 1 â¢"=' amount' to > 146,975 100
pounds, . a gainst - 347,183,776 Â¦ pounds . for :. the cor
respondinE: time last year."
The year 1900 .will pass into history aa on* of
the Quietest and most - unsatisf actorr periods
ever experienced in the wool trade.- Depression
has characterized tho situation both abroad and
at home. - -Â¦ \ '>â¢.'Â¦.;-, Â¦Â¦,,.Â¦...-Â¦.Â¦ , : -.- .".;Â¦.Â¦ ,-.-r.
The wool production] of, the country is given
aa , 281,452,437 pounds. Imports of wool . into
Boston have been 63,723,632 pounds, as compared
with 34,372,491 pounds last 1 year? The i sales of
wool In the Boston market since January Â¦ 1st
amount to 145,875,100 pounds, as compared with
347,185.776 pounds last year. In other words,
the volume , of business has been considerably
less than half of that of last year. Â¦.,, .â¢>. .-:? ,
BOSTON, Dec. 26.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter In J its annual review of the
wool situation In the United States gives the
stocks of wool in the country, exclusive of
manufacturers' holdings, as 852,247,389 pounds,
as compared with 157,398,879 pounds a year ago.
The stocks in the three principal markets of
the United Statesâ Boston. New York and Phil
adelphia â amount to 185,S00,3$9 pounds, as com
pared with 113,295,579 pounds last year.' The
stocks of wool in Boston are 130,019,084 pound*,
as compared with . 66,113,743 pounds last year.
This large increase In stocks on hands is ac
counted forbythecomparatlvelyllmlted demand
for wool this year. Increased importations of
roreiKn wools and the â¢ fact that only a very
small percentage of this year's clip has as yet
been disposed of to manufacturers. Wools
have been held back to an unusually large ex
tent this year In the country. This is especially
true of the fleece wool sections â¢ east of Â¦ t ha
Mississippi River. .' ' . ,

NEW TORK. Dec. 26.â The stock market
Trent through vicissitudes to-day, but its most
astonishing phase was the final recurrence of
the undertone of strength which has come In
to support the market so persistently of late
and driven of? all moods of depression. After
opening with a skyrocket advance In price, fol
lowed by a drop very like the skyrocket stick.
the market gathered Itself together and ignor
ing the continued pressure of liquidation which,
continued in force at some points it resumed
its Irregular Ehow of strength, the straggling
new points of strength being unaffected by the
veakness at others. The sharp reaction at
tnidsesEion was due more than anything else
to the extremely doubtful character of some
of the ( , i r.:i\Â£ advances. The character of the
etock affected and the violence of the jump In
prices gave a suggestion of speculative de
bauch, t-uch as is the invariable accompani
ment of the culmination of a bull market.
Professional traders have been constantly on
the lookout for the sign of such & culmina
tion and they sold the market on the opening
rise. These offerings were supplemented by
the heavy profit taking of those long of the
market. At this period of the market lt took
an appearance of general weakness, prices
crumbling throughout the list. The surprising
cv'r.lr.g gains in a number of Industrial spe
cialties and a few railroad 6tocks were very
generally wiped out and some of the impor
tant railroad stocks had fallen from a frac
tion to a point below Saturday's closing level.
The \-iolent break in the Northern Pacific stocks
had a large influence in the decline, as the
unbridled speculation in the same issues has
been the salient point in the market for some
days. A published statement that the preferred
stock would not be retired on the coming 1st
of January v. as the cause of the break,, as lt
Â¦would take away the- reason for the recent
rpeculatlon. The common stock was carried
down an extreme 3^4 and the preferred 3
points. A 6 per cent money rate emphasized
the cautious feeling and the relapse to 5 per
cent later in the day was an important ele
ment in the rally. The substantial character
of the buying orders encountered at the de
cline disrouraÂ«ed the bears and their buying
to cover helped the rally. It had its inception
in the local traction stocks, which were all
M| strong, with accompanying rumors of con-
FoUdated control. Â¦ Missouri Pacific. Reading
first preferrÂ«-d. People's Gas and* Sugar were '
also conspicuous (features of the late recovery.
The c.losir.K waÂ« very irregular, but with the
undertone strong. The opening- outburst was
I>a!r.ably duo in large part to manipulation
and was explainable by the busy operations of
tpeculative cliques during the holiday interval
In making demonstrative bids for almost any
amount of the stocks affected, without any
&ciual transactions being Involved as a re-
Ftrainirur influence. The opening of prices In
Brooklyn Transit varied" nearly 2 points on an
extreme advance of E%, and there were wide
CTwning? m running sales in Tennessee Coal,
fugar, Pt. Paul, Erie first preferred and Atch
lFon. The actue.1 rain* in these stocks ran
from 2 to over 5 points, except Erie first pre
ferred, which was at no time more than a
fraction over Paturday. .There seemed to be
plenty of funds available for borrower* and
there is a feeling of assurance that the j-ear
â¢Â¦ill be turned without trouble in the money
market.
The railroad bond market waa active and
rhowwl fir.ly r few weak spots. Total sales,

.. CHICAGO, Dec. 26.â Wheat waÂ» profoundly
and solemnly, duty There was scarcely enough
business to keep yfcrokers awake and nearly all
of that was of a local scalping order. .The
opening was arm on moderate world's ship
ments and for a time prices held fairly steady,
helped later by the visible Increase of only
3,331,000 bushels. L^ter talk from the Gov
ernment report, due to-morrow would be de
cidedly bearish and the absence of good ship
ping inquiry caused weakness and prices de
clined under ensuing liquidation. May sold
between^73V4@73%c and 72%c, cloÂ«ing Me lower
Corn was fairly active early, but ruled dull
thereafter. May closed unchanged at 35%c,
January a shade higher at 35TslÂ£36c and De
cember lo lower at Sti^c.
Oats were at a standstill, closing unchanged
for May. . '
Provisions started firm on light hog receipts
and higher prices at the yards. Later prices
eased off on liquidation of December .lard, -In
which a squeeze had been threatened. Janu
ary pork closed 7%c lower, lard 2214c lower and
ribs 5c depressed.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
Chicago Grain and Produce.
ThÂ« market for evaporated apples ruled
rather stoady, with a strong undertone on light
supply at unchanged prices. State common was

WEST POINT. N. Y.. Dec. 2S.-AIter a
Christmas recess of three days the mili
tary court of 'nqulry to-day resumed its
investigation of alleged brutal hazing at
the West Point military academy. Twelve
witnesses were examined by General
Brooke. General Bates and General Clous.
They were all of the present first class
and classmates of former Cadet Breth.
The witnesses were all questioned as
to whether they had held any conversa
tion with other cadets as to withholding
of testimony nt the Investigation, and
they all denied that such a thing occurred.
They said, on the contrary, all the
cadets were anxious that everything
should be told.
To-morrow Congressman P. O. Phillips
of Cleveland wlU be a witness In reference
to the statement made that he came to
the academy In . 1S9S In order to have his
boy protected from hazing. Horace Boox
of Bristol Pa., a brother of Oscar L.
to-day waa Ca
tilen part In "feet inspection." which
consisted in dropping hot candle grease
on the bare feet of fourth class men. He
e?Id Cadet Breth was never dragged out
of his tent nor put Into a straitjacket.
"What do youymake. fourth class men
d Â°'Nothinsr In' barracks but bracing,"
answered the witness. "In camp I have
had a fourth class man act as special
duty man. He cleaned my gun and bayo
net and carried ; water and cleaned my
te The witness described how cadets have
been made to run down . the company
?trÂ»ets while others threw water upon
fhem. This was called "talcing a bath."
"Did you ever see a man braced or ex
ercised to the limit of, his power of en
durance'" asksd General Brooke.
-I could not say. sir. but I have seen
them pretend to faint in order to be ex
cused from going any further with the ex
er Â»what" was the .most exhaustive action
you yourself were compelled to do aÂ» a
fourth class man?" _
"EagUng. sir." was the reply.
"Describe it. please." Â«ma
"It is a modification^ the setting- up
drill for back and legs.'* ' ' '
"Was It on account of the danger of
hazlnx -or because they wished to avoid
Koandal outside the academy that caused
the classes to do away with the prac
tice?" asked General Brcoke.^
"There was no danger." sir. and we voted
to do away with the hazing because of
the stories -published about It." replied
the witness. * *
"What besides bracing do you require a
fourth class man to dor* inquired General
â¢Â«We "have them do ridiculous forma
tions, one of which we call the *barn
yard.' The men are designated by names
of barnyard animals, and when they are
told to form th*m imitate the noises made
by. Â¦ the ' animals." ~" 'Â¦ _
"Do you make them do anything you Mil
1 "No they are .told to do It and they
generally do all they are told." ' _~
? VHow do Â¦ you ' account for ; this implicit
obedience?" tasked General Brooke.
Tb^witnessFeemed to.be puzzled fora
moment, and then said: "Well, when "I
was a fourth class man. the idea of refus
ing to do all I was requested never en
tered my head., sir."
"TVas there any brutality?"
ir Xo, sir. there was no spirit of brutality
In it. If there was brutality by word, the
fourth class man would it."
"Then he would have to fight T' sug
gested General Brooke.
"Tes. sir."
"And get beaten?"
.'"No, rot' always, sir; the fourth class
men have won fights.".
"Do you know of any men being spe
dally'prepared or Instructed In fighting?"
"No. sir."
"Was Cadet Kellar prepared for his
fight with Cadet Boo*r r
"No, ' sir; Kellar was rather a poor
boxer." was the reply.
"Did Kellar ever have any other fight
before he feught Booz?" asked General
Bates.
"No. sir."
"Then he was not known a3 a fighting
man?" asked General Brooke.
"No. sir."
These questions were evidently prompt
ed by the receipt of a newspaper clip
ping sent to the court durln* the Christ
mas recess, which stated~that unless a
man was skilled in boxing he had no
chance at West Point against cadets with
bruising abilities.
Cadet W. D. Smith of Maryland waa the
next witness. He said he had a fourth
class man to make up his bed. clean his
gun. carry water and do other work for
him In hla tent.
"Did you ever know of a cadet being
dragged from his bed and out of his test
to the street?"
"There waa always bedding upder him.
sir." was the reply. .
The witness described a number of rt
dlculous things done by fourth class men
at the bidding of upper class men. He
told among other things of a man being
required to stand on his head and while
In that position speak a piece and deliver
a right hand salute with his left foot.
"What do you mean by saying men
were required to do these things?"
"Compelled, sir."
- "Why do they. obey?"
The witness hesitated and ' then said
that fourth class men knew that they
would nave to do what they were told.
Cadet ... Edward M. Shinkle of Ohio,
another first class man. said that he had
hazed fourth class cadet- by exercising
and setting-up drills. There was nothlns
brutal In. these exercises. Describing
other forms of hazing In vogue now. be
said the most ridiculous was a "Sammy
race." P^ZJSPtSSA
"What Is a "Sammy race?* " asked Gen
eral Brooke. . -
'Two cadets are seated face to face
with a bowl of molasses between them."
explained the witness, "each being sup
plied with a. spoon, and they are instruct
ed to. feed each- other."
"Suppose a cadet should refuse to d->
what he is required V said General
Brooke. .' i HHBjBsgB|sr**S^slS
"He would be- â¢ called out. sir.**
"That means he would have to fight?"
The witness explained that the fourth
class man might be excused from fight
ing if the upper class committee decided
that the order which he had disobeyed
was one which should not have been

I Â¦wear to bed. Sometimes I don't wear
anything except a condensed undergar-
ment. That's all I wore when I got into
bed Christmas eve at the Palace Hotel
of Dunsmuir. The snow upon the ground
was a foot thick and It was twelve de-
grees below freezing point. But I didn't
care for that. I'm used to the cold.
- "About 3 o'clock in the morning I was
aroused out of a deep slumber by the
sound of fire bells. At least. I thought
they were fire bells. As I looked I thought
I saw that the hotel was afire. The flames
were coming up the staircase and I could
see them through the transom. â¢
"I tried to unlock the door, but I
couldn't 2nd the key. There seemed to
be nothing else to do but Jump out the
one window of the room. The window
was one of those old-fashioned kind that
closes the minute you let go.
"Well. I packed my things Into my grip
and made for the window. It was a sec-
ond-story window. About five feet be-
neath me was the .tarred roof of a shed.
It was covered with snow, and had a
strep Incline.
"I Jumped and landed on this roof. All
I had with me was this undergarment and
my grip. I slid down to the lower edge
of the roof and lost a lot of bark off my
knees before I got there.
"Now, when I had been out there a min-
ute I found that there was no fire at all.
The bells belonged to the freight engines
and the fire was nothing more than the
reflection from the hall lamp In the hotel,
"It was bitterly cold, and I thought I'd
freeze to death before I got to the top of
the roof again. When I rot there It was
like a Chinese puzzle trying to pick out
the window of my room again. They were
all alike.
"Finally I thought I had th* right one.
I raised It and crawled in. I no sooner
got my feet on the floor than loma fellow
with a big black mustache struck a match
and by the light of It poked a. big hess
pistol into my face.
"To say that I was scared la saytn* It
mildly. But I'll bet the fellow was as
scared as I was. I knew that and so
quick as a flash. I blew out Ms match
and made a bee line for the door. As luck

that he will go long distances sometimes

As a fireman Coles is quite extraordinary.
He Is a member of Sherman Hose No. 3

This year. Coles accepted an invitation

Now, Coles* friend lives a reasonable

It was necessary for him to stop over

The understanding was that the .country

brokers as a magnet picks up steel. That
J1.<XÂ».000 he was going to spend here was
a tempting plum, and every dealer along
the line mho bad a house and lot on his
books was ready to do business with the
millionaire from Mexico. Frank Wood
ward of the William J. Dingee Company
was one cf those lucky enough to capture
the colonel. The scene is in Woodward's
Broadway office; time. Saturday morning
about 11 o'clock.
"Now," said the colonel, planclng at his
his watch. "I am doing my banking in San
Francisco, and I have just time enough
to reach the bank before closing time it I
catch the next train."
"Oh. no, colonel." anxiously replied
Woojward, "don't go over to-dpy. You
must ttay here and look at this property
of ours."
"But I muft gr> over and 'arrange for
the meney." insisted the millionaire, casu
ally drawing a checktook from his inside
pocket.
Woodward didn't want the colonel out
of si;rht_ He realized there were a dozen
competitors waiting to seize the Croesus
from the south, and the real estate man
did Â¦not propose to" lese him.
.Woodward talked desperately. The
minutes ticked off. At last with a start
the affable colonel ejaculated. "Oh. mjv
I have mi!>-se4 my train. I'll have to ask
you tow to honor my check."
The happy Woodmprd fairly leaped to
the Vault to accommodate the Mexican

Six weeks ago Ernest Haquette staked
half of the Palace of Art on Post
street, near Montgomery, upon the life
cf Harry Veuve and Veuve lived and won
It. Last night he came to claim his own,
but erded with a genuine Rembrandt, a
bottle or two of wine and a shake of the
hand. The bet was that Veuve should die
before Christmas of this year. Haquette
had dreamed it and he had faith in his
dream, and when the time came he was
ready to pay his part of the wager and
take Veuve in as his partner.
It was six weeks ago that the bet was
made A'euve and Haquette " met and
Veuve mentioned that he had seen Ha
quette's obituary in the papers and he
thought well of it. Haquette called at
tention to the fact that the obituary was
for his partner, Cassanova. who had died
a few days before, and being on subjects
grewscme and *omber, he went on to tell
of a dream he had had. . The substance
of the dream was that Cassanova had
appeared to him and had said that with
in two or three weeks H?.rry Veuve would
join the gathering on the I other side of
the river. Htquette and Veuve were old
acquaintances, but Veuve did not see anv
thing funny in the dream and he said so,
and ottered to bet anything in sight that
not enly at the end of three weeks,' but
when Christmas came, he would be alive
and v-ell. Haquette stuck to his dream
and offered to back it with half of his
place of business on Post street and the
wager was accspied.
The Palace of Art is> a curiosity in its
way. Its walls are hung with one of the
best collections of paintings in the city,
and in cabinets end around the walls are
curios and gem? and quaint carvings
enough to tire the eye. Haquette says
$100,000 would not fit the place up ss it is
at present, yet being a sport of the old
school and willing to back hi3 word with
his all. he cheertulty put tip the half of
his place on the venture that his dream
would eonce true and that he woulo have
the melancholy pleasure of attending the
funeral of a defeated bettor before his
Christmas dinner. An agreement in legal
form was drawn up and Haquette signed
it. and all the others in the crowd signed
as witnesses.
Christmas came and Veuve called Ha
quette over the telephone and reported
alive and well and willing to claim half of
what was coming to him.
Haquette wrote a nice little note to
Veuve, saying he was glad to give half of
the Palace if only to keep Veuve on earth
a while longer, and he sent the first in
stallment on the bet â a Rembrandt worth
tlOJjCO. He sent congratulations, too. for
the holiday season and hopes of a happy
new year as well.
Last evening the new partner, accom
panied by several of his trlends, same
down to claim his own. Haquette Knew
they were coming, but he was game Â¦ In
answer to any question about his bet he
Insisted that half the place was Veuve's â
"half the pictures and works of art." he
added, "I made the wager and I bet half
of what I own. but that's all right: I'll
have to stand for It."
It was well along toward 12 o'clock
Â» hen Veuve came down to take posses
sion of his new property. With- him were
Peter Martin. Herman Oelrichs. "Walter
Martin, Bob Grayson, Tom Williams,
Truxton Beale. Harry Creswell and a
few others. They walked In and asked
for the keys of the safe, the best bottle
cf wine behind the bar and the attend
ance of all the employes of the place.
Haquette invited them to a seat, and then
over several cold bottles they discussed
what should be taken first and whether
the Veuve half should be allowed to re
main where it was or should at once be
transferred to any place the new. owner
should see tit. Then Issue was joined,
and before "Judge" Grayson the case of
Veuve vs. Haquette was tried, finds were
found and conclusions were reached, and
it was decided that with the transfer of
the Rembrandt gem the wager should
close.
There were more bottles and more good
wishes and congratulations, and a son?
or two and much hilarity over the whole
business, but It was with a sigh of relief
that Haquette found he would not have
to make good, and that he need not part
with his treasures.
The Rembrandt that now belongs to
Veuve, Haquette bought some years ago
at a sale In this city. Haquette Is an
old art connoisseur, and he knew what
he was getting better than the man who
sold it, and he got it for far less than it
was wor'h, but its los* means several
good tho-:*ands to him, and he will make
no more rash wagers. .
"I shouldn't have done It.' was his
comment before Veuve came in and the
bet was declared off, "but I made the bet.
and if he wants It, half the place Is hla."
That would have meant fifty thousand off
Haquette's Christmas.
Believed Harry Veuve "Would Die
Before Christmas, but Veuve

Charters.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Zea
landia got away for Honolulu yesterday.
Among those who went away on her was
Dr. I* E. Cofer and family. Dr. Cof er
has been for the last, five years United
States Quarantine Officer at Los Angeles,
but has been transferred to Honolulu by
Uncle. Bam. The full cabin list on the
Zealandla was as follows:
Lk-Bearwald. H. "W. Bloom, C. J. Campbell.
Dr. L. E. Cofer and wife. Miss H.- Cofer, N.
B. Cramer, Miss Dowsett, W. A. Drlscoll. P.
K. Enebo, H. T. Gilbert. J. E. Holland. Mrs.
Grace Hudson. H. T. James, F. M. Kin?, Miss
K. Kramer, H. T. Marsh. Mrs. It. Mason, Miss
E. Mays. H. F. Mocine, George Pearce, Mrs.
J. H. Raymond and child. Miss Ivy Jtlchaxd
sorv I. Rubensteln, Miss t*. D. Smith, r>. C.
Williams, Miss G. Dowsett.
In the steerage of the Zealandla there
was supposed to be twenty-five negrow
who were grodng: to Honolulu to work on
the plantations. They came from Nash
ville, Tenn., and were. In charge of R. O.
Bean, traveling agent of the Southern
Pacific. For a minute Mr. Bean released
his vigilance and in tha* minute two of
the negroes slipped ; dowH tho freight
gangway and made their escape. Tney
are shoeless and hatless and have .not a
cent, but are husky fellows and can be
depended upon to make a living.
Zealandia Off for Honolulu.
Are Heard From.
, The San Francisco owned ship Chal
lenger was reported "on change" yester
day afternoon 5 as making for the Columbia
River. She was on her way from Oyster
Harbor for Kahului, H. I., with a load
of coal when the gale came up. Just
what happened to her cannot be learned,
but the chances are that * her seaina
opened and she began to leak. In that
event the cargo will have to be discharged
and the ship recalked.
Late yesterday the ship Isaac Reed and
the bark Fresno were both sighted - off
Point Reyes. Each of them is now twen
ty-seven days out from the Bound and
they must have had a hard time of it.
The Coast Survey steamer Gedney ar
rived from Port Angeles yesterday. It
took her ten days to make the run, and
the members of the crew are not anxious
to repeat the experience. For throe days
the little vessel was hove-to and no ; one
that ' has never been aboard her can tell
how the: Gedney can roll. It is always
a case of pitch and toss with "tails up"
nine times out of ten- However, the Ged
ney came In "heads up" yesterday,
â¢whereat all hands and the cook . are de
voutly thankful.
More Ships of the Storm-Tossed Fleet
STTBTER FROM THE GALE.
"We sailed from Astoria, December 8.
Had the' wind light and line from the
northward. On December 11 It - started
to blow from the southward and continued
to I>ecember 15, i when it came away j to
blow' very hard with high confused sea
running. At 8 a. m. a terrific sea struck
the ship, throwing her over on her beam
ends. Starboard Bide was completely un
der water and. gradually settling: over.
We had only a lower, main topsail set,
the sheets or which we let go to try to
right the vessel, but she came up so slow
ly we cut and cleared away the lee braces
and tot the yards squared in, but still
the ship had about 40 degTeea list, and
being full of barley I decided to Jettison
the cargo to get her up right.
"We Jettisoned In all about 3000 bags of
barley. Our starboard bulwark stanch
ions between the fore and .rnain . rigrging
are completely broken away from the bul
warks. We got the bulwarks lashed up
with wire and secured them the best way
possible. All this time the crew were
working: up to the neck in water, one gale
after the other as fast aa it could ' blow
up till December 19, when it wound up
with a perfect hurricane from south
southeast with a high confused sea. We
used oil with great effect.
"The sea was almost overwhelming at
times and I attribute the safety of the
ship to the oil. We rode the hurricane
out under a storm spanker. When the
gale moderated and we saw the condition
of our ship, the starboard stanchions all
gone, the pump well casing: all stove in
and the main well full of grain and the
cargo shifting,' after a. consultation with
my officers and crew I decided to make
for San . Francisco to have repairs made
and the cargo restowed."
NU^IEROUS reports have reached
I this city of damages sustained by
vessels of tho coasting fleet and
also among I the wheat and lum
ber vessels that were off shore
when the . big southwester of two -weeks
ago camÂ© up. Many vessels are v overdue
and almost every day a storm-tossed
craft comes into port.
The latest victim of the elements Is the
British ship Cromartyshlre, which was
towed in through, the Golden Gate yes
terday. She sailed from Portland for Ire
land on December 9. She has aboard 10,669
centals of wheat valued at 99780 and 42,000
centalsof barley valued at $33,841. The
barley was light and . the wheat not
enough to ballast the ship. , In conse
quence the captain found . he could, not
carry sail. During: the southwester the
Cromarty shire had - to run under bare
poles, and even then the crew say they
were lucky to escape. - .
The Cromartyshire is a vessel with a
history. She , is the Bhlp that ran down
or was run Into by the French liner La
Bourgogno In the Atlantic about three
years ago. On that occasion there was
a terrible loss of life and the Cromarty
shire .was only saved by her bulkheads
and water-tight compartments. She
reached port In a crippled condition with,
many of La Bourgogne's passengers
and crew aboard and was later repaired
and put in commission. This is her sec
ond voyage since the disaster and she
is once more in trouble. The . cargo will
bÂ© mere evenly distributed and tho Cro
martyshlra will again sail "for Cork for
orders," -
Captain Reed's report of the Cromarty
shire' s hard time is as follows: '

â¢ Is. therefore, the teacher not a mighty force,
and might I not say the mightiest force In
civilization? Every teacher of all of us can
in humility and exaltation say, "I have done
something to bless mankind." Â«The other day
I was in Canton, a town in which a gr?at and
good man lives when he is at home. On the
wall of the Canton High School there Is Â¦ a
bronze tablet with this Inscription: "In
memory of Annie McKlnley, a beloved teacher
in the Canton schools from September, I860, to
June, 1890." Thirty years of noble work; bless
her for it!
If next year when President McKlnley visits
your State Â¦ you speak of her to him, . a dew
will come into his eye and . he will say:
Tha other day I went down to that Oxford
of the Pacific, Talo Alto. What do you think
Is the best thing down at Palo Altoâ those
great corridors, that endowment exceeding
that of Osford? No. The beat thing at Palo
Alto is the president and his faculty. - Bulll
your buildings, line them with marble, make
them Oxfords, but remember .that it is .the
human soul that Is to touch your soul. Brick
and mortar cannot do It as will human en
vironment.
The teacher embodies the environment of thÂ«
persoa more adequately than any other force.
I wish we couM have an examination in in
fluence. In all these changes, these Improve
ments that California stands for, you 1 will some
day find a means to weigh the influence of the
teacher as a person. A lady spoke to me to
day concerning the coming of the new presi
dent at Berkeley, whom I love and esteem.
She said . that no sooner had he come : than
all tha S boys on . the campus seemed to walk
straightÂ«r and carry their heads higher. .
Bring to your aid the great books of the
world. : The book is our tool and tbe mind is
our timber. Better than railroads, better than
shops or factories and any material achieve
ment is for us to use these Infinite powers ; of
great souls to make great souls in boys and
girls. *
thÂ« "Commemoration Ode" by Lowell, and
Tennyson's "In Memorlam." In life's storm
and stress, in all of life's wars and losings,
let us bring to luV'S problems those great
thoughts. â¢ '
Further, I believe in the power and Influence
of the church in education. My religion is
not yours and yours is not another's. For my
present purpoee I have no concern which
typ e of religion you adopt, but I do believe
that you ought to use whatever type you do
adopt for the Inspiration and betterment of
your pupils. I respect the constitution, but I
believe that under the constitution we can usÂ«
religion much more than we have been using
it. There is no Influence that bo broadens the
horizon as the knowledge that man has a re
lation to the infinite. You and I have the
chance cf the minister in being constantly with
the boys and girls, and I believe in every
State we are not even obeying the formal law;
we are not bringing the power of righteous
ness, of the unseen, to inspire, t9 mold human
character.
The teacher also has a euperb chance for the
betterment of men through the book. There
are books more important than the textbook,
and those are the book biographical and the
book of poems. I am not eo much concerned
as Â«to whether pupils shall know, anything
after examinations, but I do want them to be
able to think, to be able to respond to high
eÂ«ntiments, and to be touched by the power
of imagination. The book biographical, that
teaches the boy life, is better than the book
that teaches him to parse or to . figure. Of
course I find no fault with accuracy, - but I
want my boy to have the opportunity to say.
"Papa, .1 want to be a great man. like that
man."
We are living in a material age, but I want
my child to lift -Ms eyes to the great lights.
To my mind there are two great poems, the
one written on this side of the Atlantic, and
the other in that little Island across the sea;
with our pupils than their fathers are?' If
we fail to love that boy or girl we are falling
for ourselves and for the help we might be
to that boy or girl. You may not feel the
love of the heart, but there is the mightier
love of the will that eaya. "I will take that
child and make the most of It for the life
everlasting."

DR. CHARLES FRANKLIN THWING. PRESIDENT OF WESTERN RE
SERVE UNIVERSITY. ADDRESSES THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS'
ASSOCIATION ON "THE TEACHER AS A FORCE IN CIVILIZATION."
from all parts of the
I State were gathered In Metropoli-
I tan Hall at 1:30 o'clock yesterday
H. afternoon for the opening meeting
of the thirty-fourth annual ses
sion of the California Teachers' Associa
tion. The body ol the hall was com
pletely filled and_ many teachers were
seated in the gallery.
Never before has a session of the Cali
fornia Teachers' Association giving- so
much promise of profitable intercourse
convened. Earnestness and enthusiasm
are felt In the very atmosphere of this
convention.
The San Francisco City and County
Teachers' Institute is being held jointly
with the meeting of the more compre
hensive organization, and though there Is
a murmur of disapproval from the local
teachers on account of their consequent
inability to spend the holiday vacation
according to their own desires they are
entering Into the convention work with
all the interest felt by those who are In
attendance by choice.
J. W\ McClymonds, Superintendent of
Schools of Oakland and president of the
association, called the convention to or
der, and after a song and an encore by
a male quartet he said: "Mayor Phelan
has some complimentary things to say
about the people of California, we trust."
Mayor Phelan spoke in general terms of
the great importance of such conventions.
He spoke of advancement made in past
years by the schools of San Francisco
and predicted still greater changes for the
better. Continuing he said: ,
The University of California has grown and
developed throughout the year, and it is the
apex of the educational system of the State.
A movement is on foot and I have been hon
ored with a place on a committee selected to
Indues the legislature to provide the university
-with more money. The collateral Inheritance
tax is recommended, and we hope the teach
ers of the State will lend their support.
The city of San Francisco welcomes you. and
It welcomes the distinguished visitor who hon
ors us with his presence to-day; Dr. Charles
F. Thwing, president of Western Reserve Uni
versity. â¢
Cecil TV. Mark, president of the Board
of Education of San FranclBoo, welcomed
the teachers. He referred to the develop
ment of the San Francisco schools, and
in conclusion paid high tribute to the San
Francisco State Normal School.
Reginald H. Webster, Superintendent of
the Common Schools of San Francisco,
was introduced to deliver an address of
welcome in behalf of the teachers of this
city. He was received with prolonged ap
plause. He said in part:
We hare reason to rejoice In a constantly
augmenting interact in our public schools on
the part of the people. W e observe with
pleasure improved school houses, the tendency
to insist on a higher standard of qualification
required of teachers, and a more earnest and
practical attention to their duties on the part
Of school officers.
This is an age of sharp conflict of opinion In
all departments of thonpht and endeavor.
I'olitical. social and ethical theories, at strange
and even startling variance with the results of
experience, are being advanced. The public
schools are not escaping these influences.
Xovel theories of education are seeking recog
nition, otten making experimental stations of
school rooms. The fea*lbility of the simple
course of study exempt from the fads of the
day is not only denied by some, but the value
of the most fundamental studies is questioned.
Non-essentials are Â¦"enriching" courses of
study. Simplicity and thoroughness, that
should characterize school work, are slighted
or ignored. Amid the clash of opinion and
practice there is need for sound Judgment and
wise counsel. Teachers, upon you rÂ«Â»8ts In a
great degree the grave responsibility of main
taining the potency and efficiency of the pub
lic schools, so that from them shall go youth
not with superficial and, unassimllated Inform
ation about many things, incapable of strong
thought, but youth thoroughly schooled in a
few essentials, strong- In body, wholesome In
mind, ethics and morals.
Mrs. Cecil W. Mark sang a soprano solo,
and received an enthusiastic encore.
James A- Foshay, Superintendent of
Schools of Los Angeles, was to have re
sponded to the addresses of welcome, but
he was detained and did not arrive In time
for the response. That duty was filled by
Superintendent McClymonds, who Â¦ fol
lowed his remarks with a brief opening
address as president of the association.' ,Â¦
President Charles F. Thwlng of West
ern Reserve University was introduced
for the principal address of the afternoon.
He epoke In part as follows:
Ladles and Gentlemen and Fellow Workers:
I feel myself most happy in being here and
more happy still to be here \ to talk to teachers
as a force in civilization.'
The family, the church, the book environment
constitute mighty forces of civillratlon. The
first and possibly the most important of these
Is the family. Each of us is born into a
home. Long before we knew It there was a
smile looking down upon us and love k was
given us long before love could be < returned.
And sad the fate of us if at death there is no
tear dropping down upon our marble faces.
But airo the church stands as a force equally
mighty. The church, whatever may be one's
belief or condition, will be recognised by-. all
as a mighty factor. It kept the lamp of learn
ing burning for a thousand years. The church
to-day Is and is to be a mighty force in the
betterment of men. â¢
The book Is likewise of greatest Importance
to humanity. There are four forces that meet
In American life and â¢ three of these come to
us through the book. The Hebrew, the Greek,
the Roman and the Anglo-Saxon each offers
itself to the modern life. - We are touched by
the spirit of Greece, and through the book we
receive our Greek culture and civilization, and
through the book also Roman civilization
touches us. It' is Â¦ the poem, the essay, that
gives us Rome. The Anglo-Saxon . has not
reached us through thÂ» book, but the Greek,
the Roman, the Hebrew has reached us su
premely in that manner.
But also not simply the family, the church
the book, touch us, but also human environ
ment, which Is of prime significance. I. for
one. talking not a* a scholar, say that influence
of climate, plain or mountain is of far less
Importance than is commonly believed. . We
are apt to magnify tho influence of the sky
klsslng Alps In inspiring noble character . and
conduct. In Europe there is a> little land oom
pored of seabottoms. drained and dried, -which
offered resistance to a foe lately our foe. In
a most sublime struggle for liberty. Holland,
little Holland, represents heroism Just as mag
nificent as 8wit*Â«-rland Itself. But there is an
environment ' of greatest Importance and , that
is the environment of person*.
The family, tha church, the book, ' the * en
vironment Of vthe, person, are mighty,; forces
working for the bettennant of men, but' might
ier than all. comprehending . and uniting all
tbÂ«ee forces. Is the teacher. â¢ ;>-."-,Â¦;Â¦.::.- Â¦- .â¢?"â¢-,,
The foundation of the family is love. Â¦ What
should be the primary relation- of the teacher
to the school? f? Imply lave. The teacher .who
does not love her pupils is not worthy of being
a teacher. . An unloved child ; la an orphan.
The student who is not . loved , by s the . teacher
misses a mighty fore* for his guidance. Why,
do you know thai we teachers are mor* often
Speculation has been rife as to what
Scott will do concerning his deputies who
will be replaced by civil service eliglbles.
The commission notified him that It was
prepared to certify fifteen deputies at $125
per month each for appointment. Only
three of the present iorce are high enough
up on the list to be selected at once. Two
others may be considered should some of
those preceding them fail to qualify or re
fuse to accept. Ten of the deputies now
employed are not on the list, five of them
having refused to take the examination,
the other five failing to pass. As foretold
In The Call last week, these ten and pos
sibly twelve will lose their positions. They
were so informed yesterday by Scott, with
whom they had a conference. They
pleaded not to be disturbed In their places,
but Scott stated that he would have to
comply with the civil service law. though
he regTetted to be obiiged to dismiss men
he had found reliable. George McCalvy.
whose standing as an experienced clerk
was-toa low to admit of his reappolnt
ment, is high enough up on the list of
eligible deputies to be certain of selection
for one of the hitter positions.

N. Martlnovich, G. H. McCalvy. William
O'Neil, M. Schwartz and J. Volsenet. S
Scott intends to file a requisition for six
more clerks to make up his complement
of twenty-three," and has decided on
Â¦William. J. Tiernan and Rudolph Albora,
who are on the eligible list, for appoint
ment. Albora is one of the old staff, and
will only be temporarily out of office.
Scott will subject his new clerks to a
little examination of his own to determine
their eligibility to fill the positions. Should
any of them prove incompetent he will
forthwith dismiss them and make new
requisitions on the eligible list. He will
also exact a bond of $5000, which all hiÂ»
old clerks had to furnish.

Of the nineteen certified Scott rejected
the names of Charles Broad and James
A. Code. Only two of the old force will
be retained, C. F. Knerr and F. R. Smith.
The following-named clerks will lose their
positions as a consequence of being sup
planted by civil service eliglbles:
Tax Collector Scott made a requisition
yesterday on the Civil Service Commis
sion for seventeen clerks from tbe eligible
list. In accordance with the rules, the
names of nineteen were certified, and
from these Scott selected the following
named seventeen to serve in his office at
a salary of $100 per month each, their ap
pointment to date from January 1, 1901:

Amos Burr, who has been located In
this city as traveling passenger agent for
the Vanderbllt lines, has been transferred
to Los Angeles. â¢ . â¢
"He will survey the field well first,"
said. Mr. Gate's, "and when he has done
this he will be able to act for the best ln
tcreBts'of the company.
"Mr. Hays' policy In, the past has been
to make his road earn/as much as possi
ble and at the same time keep the ex
pense account within a reasonable figure.
By this I don't mean tha; needs have been
sacrificed for the sake of increased profits,
nor. salaries reduced at* the cost of good
officials. The. Hays policy, as I take it, is
to get the very most for the money. That
this plan, has been â¢ successful it is but
necessary' to note Mr. Hays' record while
general manager of the Grand Trunk. Hia
rinanclal management of the affairs of
this great road was really remarkable.
"Do 'I think Hays will run the Pacific
Mall Company, too? Well." perhaps he can
tell you better. The Southern Pacific and
Pacific Mall are very closely affiliated
with one another now, and it would seem
only . natural' that the head of the one
company should take some interest-in the
affairs of the. other. -The talk about the
sale of "the Huntington estate's interests
in the Southern Pacific is all bosh."
Mr. Gates thinks the new president will
aim to strengthen, develop. and broaden
the railroad's lines wherever practicable,
all of 'which would be as much to the
advantage of California and San Fran
cisco as to the company;
Mr. Hays is now in St. â¢ Louis. He wiil
be met by several officials of the com
pany at New Orleans sometime this week
and in company with them will make the
trip to this city. The date of his arrival
here is now fixed at about January 10.
H. K. Huntlngton and J. .C. Stubbs left
yesterday for New. Orleans and "William
Hood, chief engineer, starts to-night.
The secretary of the big railroad com
pany speaks very highly of the^company'a
new president, Charles M.' Hays, 'and pre
dicts a great future for the road under
his skillful management. Mr. Gates does
not anticipate â¢ the early inauguration of
any sweeping changes or shake-ups in the
present . personnel of the Southern Pa
cific's big corps of managers.
I. E. Gates,- secretary of the Southern
Pacific, with offices In New York City, is
at the Palace. Mr. . Gates' trip to the
coast is a hurried one, and he will start
East again to-morrow. .He has come out
here to attend to the filing for probate of
the whl of the late Collis P. Huntlngton.
Mr. Gates is one of the executors of the
Will.

MiSS Birtha Smith Performs
an Act of Heroism at .
Cloverdale.
Hcrses Balk in Midstream and Driv
er's Timidity Hesults in a
Wet Christmas on
Dry Creek-
"Yes," rhimed in both of the men, "wait
until w* meet that driver and we won't
do a thing to him."
The three- returned to this city yester
day and were met at the ferry by a. group
of friends who had heard of the accident
and were caper to learn the details. Mod.
est Miss Smith was made to Dose as a
heroine by her brother and friend, but
lauRhinply remarked that she thought the
driver showed more "sense than any of the
others.
The wet and exhausted party started for
thev ranch. Their course lay for five miles
along the slippery bank of J>ry Creek,
where they were at ali times la Imminent
danger of losing their footing and again
findlnp themselves In danger of drowning.
Howwer, all safely reached the ranch,
thankful that they were alive to recount
the story of their adventures. Iiry cloth-
Ing was procured and after a warm meal
none felt any the worse for the experi
ence.
By this time Bradford, who had been
clinging to the wagon, managed to catch
hold of the rope, and started for shore
hand over hand. When about twenty feet
from the bank the rope, which had been
partially cut by the horse's hoofs, parted
and he was swept down stream for 200
yards. Smith and his sister ran along the
bank seeking a convenient spot to render
assistance. Bradford's strength was fast
failing, and he had been carried under
the surface twice when Miss Smith waded
boldly out into the stream and pulled him
toward the land. She lost her footing
when near the bank and both she and the
bonlface -would have drowned if Smith
had not managed to reach his slst*r and
haul her to land, she tenaciously cilnging
to Bradford's coat.
Both the other men retained their pres
ence of mind and Smith hastily fastened
a. long rope which lay In the bed of the
wa^on to a wheel and struck out for the
bank of the stream. After a hard strug
gle he reached land and then called upon
his sister to follow him. Without a mo
ment's hesitation the brave girl grasped
the roi>e and essayed the trip to safety.
She had nearly reached land when her
strength gave out, but she was grasped
by her brother just as she released her
hold and was being drawn back Into the
treacherous current.
During these exciting moments the
horses were floundering in the creek, part
of the time swept off their feet by the
swift stream, and both were becoming
badly tangled In the harness. Bradford
â¢rraÂ« unwilling: to leave the animals to
drown and managed to release them from
the harness before trying to save him
self. One of the horses was swept under
the wapon. which overturned and hurled
Bradford into the water. After getting
clear of the wagon the horse became en
tangled in the rope by which' Smith and
his sister had reached shore and was
literally dragged to the bank of the
ttream.
Owing to the recent heavy rains, Dry
Creek, over which the party had to
pass, was a raging torrent, very deep
and about fifty leei in width. Marshall
drove his team boldly into the current
and when the center was reached the
water was flowing over the seats. At thle
point the horses balked and, according to
the members of the party, Marshall be
came so terrified that he called upon them
to save themselves, and Jumping into the
water swam back to shore.
On the day before Christmas, Bradford,
Smith and Miss Smith departed for the
George J. Smith ranch, twelve miles west
of Cloverdale. Arriving in town late In the
evenir.e. they waited until Christmas day
to ride </ut to the ranch, where they in
tended to spend a few days in fishing and
hunting. A team was engaged at the liv
ery stable of C. K. Humbert, with an em
ploye of the stable named Marshall as
driver.
There are three residents of this
city to whom Christmas of the year
1300 will always be a memorable
occasion. W. E. Bradford, proprietor
of the Commercial Hotel; Henry
J. Smith, a member of the well-known
ho'jse-paint'.as firm of George H. Smith
& Sons, and Miss Bertha Smith, his Fis
ter. came near losing their lives In the
swollen waters of a stream while on an
outing in the vicinity of Cloverdale In
Sonoraa County, throug-h what each de
nounces in unmeasured terms as the
cowardice of the driver of the wa^on In
which the party were being conveyed to
their destination. It is a thrilling tale of
raping waters, balky horses, terrorized
driver, broken life line and woman's hero
ism, and both of the men feel certain that
at lenM two of the party would not to-day
be alive to tell the tale were it not for the
heroism of the woman.
