STORY OF
THE ENGINEER
WHO RAN
HIS ENGINE
THROUGH MILES
OF FIRE TO SAVE
A BRIDGE.as.rollows: Nurnburg 547. AleslaooG, Frank
furt 610, Samoa S52, and Bosnia about 1200.
The Bosnia is an immense ship of its kind
â one_of the largest ever In the bay of
San Francisco. She carries a Condenser
that will dietlll about 50,000 gallons of
water per day in case the supply of fresh
water grows short and salt water must
be made drinkable. It takes twenty-five
tons of coal to run the condenser for one
day, and the 50,000 gallons would only last
the 120Q horsea a little over four, days, so
the use of this apparatus wduld' prove
rather expensive. Every ship carries an
ample supply of fresh water and food,
howeverâ rations for sixty days, and the
trip with a fair run should not take over
twenty-eight daysâ so none of them are
apt to be obliged to call upon artificial
ways for Increasing their water supply.
The allowance per day for each horse
is put at 20 pounds of hay, f> pounds of
oats, 9 gallon? of water and carrots for
dessert; so in the case of the Bosnia with
its 1200 horses provided with rations on
that basis for sixty days it is easy to un
derstand why the dock looks as if the
products of all the farms of California
were there to be dropped into the cav
ernous hold of this groat ocean monster.
The horses are to be well cared frir #;â¢â¢-.
sights of the year for Californians. Now
they are ready, with their lessons well
learned, to pay their respects to the Em
peror's soldiers In the Orient and become
a. part of the German army corps.
Often horses are loaded on a ehlp by a
box contrivance and hoist, bu: here the
animals are led up a gangplank as If they
â¢were first class passengers. This Is not
out of regard for the feelings of the horse,
but because where It can te done it is
much quicker than any hoisting arrange
ment.
Five great ocean steamers it takes to
get these four thousand horse recruits to
their destination. And the amount of
hammering, changing, fitting and general
trouble necessary to get one of them
'ready for service appears most appalling
to the uninitiated. When they are all pre
pared for their living freight* they look
from ihe inside like three-story hotels
with little rooms some eight feet high by
two and a half feet wide and seven feet
long; only the rooms have no walls,
merely two strong boards on each Bide.
Bo the horse's stateroom Is really a penâ
a miniature corral â or. to return to the
original suggestion, nothing more than a
crate. And a very good thing It Is, too.
for what would the poor animal do in
case of a storm if he had all the room he
warned? Any ere who has ever seen a
horse down and watched his clumsy at
tempts to get up will easily appreciate
this. Moreover, to keep the animal still
more secure In case of a heavy sea each
Ftall is arranged with a cling, so the
hors? can be purported. He Is not hoisted
off his Uet, but can at will take the
â¢vt-oiRht on' his feet and rest in this im
provisod hammock.
The side boards of the stalls are loose
to they can he removed, and when the
animals are first put on the ship all the
boards arc taken out to allow the horse
that is to occupy the end stall to get his
place. Once In position he Is tied by two
ropes, so he cannot swing his head from
Bide to side ami Interfere with his neigh
bor. Then the r.ide boards are put backâ
eo on until all the horses .for that row are
In place.
Once in his crate the horse stays there
until he arrives at Taku. This might ap
pear to some as a hardship, for few peo
ple know that horses get along very nicely
without lying down. They can sleep
standing up. and in fact many of them
never lie down at all. If the animal tires
and his feet begin to swell from stand-
Ing on the hard flooring he is given his
ellng to recline in. In case of sickness
his mates are moved over a stall, so the
Invalid can have the size of his crate

They are draught horses and mules,

For weeks there has been a great buy-
Ing of horses and mules throughout the
West, and the training- and education of
the animals at Baden has been one of the
FOTTR MILLION and some odd
pounds of crated horseflesh are be
ing eent to Taku in far off China.
The German Kaiser decided that by
Tray of preparation for any subsequent
trouble that may happen of Interest to
the Fatherland he would like four thou
cand horses and he Is getting them as fast
aa steam can take them to him.
One might Imagine from the use of the
term "crated horse flesh" that the Kaiser

goods. Let there be no misunderstanding
â the horses are really crated for their

the way. But to make the start often re
quires the combined effort of two mounted
men, who rush their horses against the

the short space of time allowed between
the arrival of the ships entirely devoid

the animals. But the horses are well

that skill and money can give them, for
a finer lot .of animals never left this port,
or any other for that matter. They are
well formed, sleek and spirited enough
to prove an addition to any gentleman'*
stable, and If the Kaiser is not well
pleased with his American horses he is
not a good Judge of horseflesh.
Twenty-eight days Is a long time for a
horse to stay In bis stall without a
glimpse of the blue sky except an occa
sional beam through an open hatch in fair
weather. But as they have all they can
wish to eat. plenty of good company and
nothing to do but to stand and look wise.
there Is no reason to believe that thea*
"They understand a Joke, too, and when
one of them kicks the legs of the horse
next to him they will pass it along down
the line, gaining in force as It goes until
the last horse gets an eye-opener that Is
amazing. You would not think that they
could get their legs under'the boards di
viding the stalls, but they manage It
some way, and as they can't do much
,harm and seem to enjoy It why, it does
not matter."
"Many people ask ma If the horses get
seasick. That Is always -the first question
anyway about anything living that take?
an ocean voyage." said the chief !n speak
ing about his trips. "Of course' they 3o,
but not so far as their stomachs are con

wisely, will not eat until they become ac
customed to the motion of the boat. When
they get used to the ship's roll they besln
to sway backward and forward to accom
modate themselves to It, and even when
they get In still water they will keep up
this motion, so that bv their own cen
certed movement they will give the vessel
quite a roll from side to side. "When they
first strike the land It Is curious to watch
them. ' They seem dazed and then It grad
ually dawns upon them that they are
free again and they are tickled to death.
They roll, and run, and Jump about Ilka

Chief Engineer F. H. Evers of the Lee-

There are also bats and lizards which

which show the skill that he has acquired

Ills samples of butterflies were sent to

pictures and buttons, and when he finds

say:
"Isn't he a bully fellow?" pronouncing
each word very correctly and distinctly.
He has a lar^e collection of these souve

which he found in the mall, are hung
about the walls In hl3 room. He Is very

or slaves, as among all Melanesian and
map' Malay tribes, but are companions
and equals, carefully protected from se
vere labor or anything that might impair
their grace and beauty. They devote
themselves solely to household ; work,
making mats and tapa cloth and plaiting
ornamental baskets, engaging only in
such light outdoor employments as fruit
gathering and fishing, which In their
heavenly climate Is pastime rather than
labor.
"The manly beauty of the young men Is
very remarkable. One in particular who
had decked his hair with the flowers of
the scarlet hibiscus might have sat for an
Antinous. Their features are often beau
tiful. The nose Is rafter long and some
what arched. The hair is dark brown or
black, smooth and curly, totally unlike
either the frizzled mop of the Papuan or
the perfectly straight black hair of the
true Malay in character. They are cheer
ful and Joyous, and fond of songs, of
which they have a great number handed
down by tradition, as were those of the
bards of old."
Lord George Campbell In his description
of the voyage of the Challenger says of

who strike one at first so much as these
islanders. Their clear light copper-brown
colored skins, yellow and curly hair,
good-humored, handsome faces, their tout
ensemble, formed a novel and splendid
picture of the genus homo,' and as far as
physique and appearance go they gave
certainly an impression of being a su
perior race to ours.

This first story is peculiarly in the
Stockton vein; fear no onei loves better
than he to place his characters in the
most outlandish predicaments where the
reaccr Ccela net at all alarmed as to their
actual safety, but car.not help sympathiz

themselves and understanding their ex

placed them. That is the greatest chana
cf Stockton's work, he allows his imag

almost isclined to accept as gospel truth
anything that he is pleased to say.
This first .Â«tory of "The BuIier-PoddinK
ton Compact" wiJl be remembered by
DU87 readers as having appeared a short
lime ago in Scribner's Magazine. It re
counts the adventures of two worthy
imddle-acc-d frierds who are devoted to
each other in town, but neither will visit
the other at his country residence for
the reason that one is fond of yachting
nrd the other of driving hordes. The
y.-ichtÂ«=man Is frightened to C< ath of a'
bene and the landsman correspondingly
filarmed at the thought of a sailboat.
Finally they make an asr'-^mcnt that
r-nch shall visit the other, and the yachts
man goes first to call upon the landsman.
Early in the morning following his ar
rival he is asked by his friend the lands
man to take a drive, ajid with much mis
giving upon the part of the sailor they
ft forth. By a curious chance they are
Just up^-n the edge of a mill pond as the
train whistles, and the sailor begs his
bfcsd to turn arour.d as he fears a run
away. The nervousness of the man fond
cf the sea acts upon his friend's driving
ar.d startles thÂ« horse to such an extent
that In the general excitement he backs
the rig down over the bank and horse,
buggy and men find themselves In the
water. Then it is that the yachtsman's
Bailing experience stands them in good
etead. and frcm the craven he is at once
transform*-d into the lion. He sorely
feels the ne<?d of a rudder and a bit of a
pail (0 make the wagon a good boat, but
he finally pilots the strange craft safely
to the chore â not. however, until he haa
been obliged to dive for the lines, which
have been dropped by the nervous lands
man, and perform other feats denoting
aquatic and nautical ski!l. Safely home
and enjoying an after-dinner cigar the
yachtsmen gives his friend good advice
according to the lights of the experienced,
sailor:
'â¢ 'I tell you. William.' said Mr. Buller.
Â»s tbe two sat smoking after dinner, 'what
you ought to do; you should never go out
driving without a life-pYcserver and a pair
of oart. I always take them. It would
make you feel safer.' "
The next season, however, the landsman
has a chance to offer his yachting friend
some good advice through some remark
able occurrences that happened when the
visit of the former year is returned.

Wet sheets, baths of various kinds, from
vapor to salt, sprays, ablutions, wet

"Are these used for all kinds of sick

a bit of toasted cheese could not by any

a game animal, though it might well be a
"rare bit," so ho Jumped at the conclusion
that time and the corruptions which time

Now, this is all wrong. "Welsh rabbit"
Is a genuine bit of slang belonging to a
large class of similar terms describing in
mock heroic language the favorite dish or
special product of a particular district.
Here are a few examples that are abso

He easily disposed of the question of
to which the human flesh Is heir, it cer
tainly gives tone and delicious warmth
to the entire body.
IT is high time that all lovers of Eng
lish should unite in common protest
against that barbarous collocation of
words "Welsh rarebit." Every now
and then in the past some good man has
raised his voice in a plea, for the right
phrase, "Welsh rabbit/' and has then dis
appeared. Such staccato protests have
proved unavailing. The word rarebit' has
now Insinuated itself upon 99 per cent ot
all the menus. The' smaller hotels caught
the habit from the greater ones. The
French and German hostelries Imitated
their American contemporaries. Nor is
this the worst. Owners of chophouses and
restaurants flaunt the offensive word on
their gilded signboards in the very faces
of the public at large.
Now, why is this? Not a dictionary of
to-day sanctions the use of "rarebit,"
though in a temporary, aberration of Judg
ment Worcester and Webster once did.
Perhaps hotel men are too busy to consult
dictionaries, x Then-, let them- hearken f.to
the indirect reproof they are continuously
receiving from their customers.
I, have- been in many, many places
where the menus announce "rarebits." I
have never heard any one order anything
else than a rabbit. Nay. the very waiter
who repeats the order to' the cook says
"Welsh rabbit."
That is. indeed, jone of the most curious
of all philological feats-^that by .-which
some amateur etymologist of the past
forced the wrongful substitution of "rare
bit" for "rabbit" upon the world. It has
ever been a common habit with the ety

One little girl limped painfully over

Herr Willman returned to the grass and

The Interior warmth of the body uses the
water clinging to the exterior as material

"Wiping Is rubbing, and as It cannot be
done equally on every spot It produces
disproportionate natural warmth. This is
not of much consequence with healthy
people, but it is of great moment,- to sick
and weak ones. The non-wiping helps to
the most regular, most equal and most
ppeedy natural warmth.
Since I was with the Knelpplsts I did
as the Kneipplsts do, and thrust my feet,
into my shoes without wiping them. Herr
Willman explained the theory of non
wiping thus: "After a cold application
the body must not be wiped, except the
head and the hands as far as the wrist.
The latter is only done In order not to
wet the clothes when dressing. The wet
body is at once covered with dry under
linen and other articles of clothing. This
must be done as quickly as possible, so
that all the wet spots may be -closed her

After that first icy thrill I began to like
the sensation and felt aggrieved when
Herr Willman ordered me to "keep off
the grass." Ten minutes is the maximum
time allowed a novice, though the others
etay from a quarter to half an hour. The
dewy grass is softer than velvet and un
hampered by shoes there is an elasticity
impossible on pavements.

Of a truth a surprising number of peo

J*F there is any part of the life stories of
II great men which has a fascination for
11 every one it is certainly that which
tells us how they wooed and won their
wives,' and it. would seem that their differ
ent methods of lovemaking are. at least as
characteristic of the men as any other of
their, a'cts. : , , . -â¢
One cannot, for.. Instance, picture Uis
marck; laying a long siege to a lady's
heart and consuming himself with sighs
and: tears? .--It was characteristic of the
man that he should take Cupid by the ear
and compel him to subjection â and so he
did. It was at a wedding that he first saw
Fraulein von Puttkanimer, and to see was
to bevanquished. He had scarcely doffed
his wedding garments when he sat down
and wrote to her parents, demanding her
hand in marriage.
When Herr von Puttkammer received
this peremptory : demand from a younjr
man* whose repute was not too good, "Jt
was," he said, "as If some one had struck
me on the head with a heavy ax." ; How
ever, he invited the bold wooer to pay. him
a visit, and within : a few >. hours young
Bismarck made his appearance.
On his arrival the parents and daughter
were â¢ prepared to give : him j a polite i and
formal welcome; but Bismarck's inten-
tlon3 were much more cordial, for. ignor
ing the extended hands of the parents, he
threw his arms around the daughter and
gave her a hearty and resounding kiss.
The citadel was stormed and within a few
minutes the Impetuous lover was formally
betrothed.
Mr. Gladstone's wooing was much more
conventional and ceremonious, as might
be expected. It was over a dinner table
that Miss Glynne caught her first glimpse
of the young man to whom she was to
devote her life. "Do you see that young
man?" a statesman who was sitting next
to her said. "Some .day he will be Prime
Minister of England."
No wonder the young girl's interest was
arouse'd; and when. In the winter follow
ing, they met again In the lovers' land oi
Italy, what wonder that the wooing pro
ceeded apace, and that the foundation of
one of the most beautiful married lives In
history was laid?
* No man ever had a more romantic woo
ing than Richard Biinsley Sheridan when
he determined to make Miss Llnley, the
beautiful "Nightingale of Bath." s hls wife.

Sheridan's â romantic devotion won her
heart. He diguised himself as a coach

of an odious wooer, with whom ha fought
two duels on her behalf. And this was
but a type of the chivalrous adventures
which ultimately enabled him to lead her
to the altar In April, 1773.
His second wooing was Just as persist
ent. When Sheridan first met the beauti
ful daughter of the Dean of Winchester
he was a middle-aged man, and anything
but personally fascinating. Miss Ogls
could not bear the sight of him. and
called him "an odious creature" and "a
ridiculous fright," but within a short time
she was glad to give her hand and heart
to the "most fascinating man In TVifi^rni.
and a husband of whom any girl mlgrht bÂ«

It was Mrs. Lewis rather than Disraeli
who did the wooing, for she mads no con

UP In Renssclaer County a prosper
ous farmer Is the owner of a team
of mustangs which are serviceable
drivers and can make good time
on the road. The ether day he drove them
something like twenty miles and it was
deep twilight when they were four miles
from home. A chilly rain had begun, and
having no cover and no umbrella he urged
them forward. Just as the darkness grew
dense and black the team stopped short.
The driver tried coaxing first, then the
whip, but they would not move.
Nothing of the kind had ever happened
before. The team had been skittish at
times, but never balky. The driver at last
pot out to reason with them. or. rather,
with the brown mare that was the team's
leader Of course everv team has a
leader that determines its course as abso
lutely as a walking delegate determines
en the course of a lot of cloakmakers. Ho
patted the mare on the head and spoke
to her gently, but ebe only put her ears
back and whinnied softly.
Here was a clear case of a strike for
chewing tobacco entirely outside the walls
of a penitentiary. Mustangs are queer
creatures, anyhow.
All at once a bright thought struck him.
He. recalled that he had more than once
amused himself by srlving to this mare
some chewing tobacco. She had always
taken it readily enough. Horses often
have a predilection for the tobacco habit
Deer, by the way, nave the same fond
ness. The weed seems to be a sort of
tonic for both hordes and deer. ThÂ«
driver remembered also that he had a
large plug of tobacco :n his pocket â a 10
cent plug, he called it.
He took this plug out and -was wonder
ing how he could break off a piece for thÂ«
mare, when she put down her mouth and.
with the pettishness of a child, snatched
the whole plug out of his hand. She
chewed with the greatest satisfaction and
he. being familiar with horses, concluded
that the balking was over, got Into the
carriage and drove along. There was no
further trouble.
"A dozen men in thÂ« crowd declared
positively that the> deputy was the ->al

She accomplished the perilous feat and
made an official report through the 'Bul

Like most of the world's greatest work

count them. It was only in an unguarded
moment of girlish enthusiasm about her
work that she said:
"As a child in San Francisco I would

Mr. Pericord appeared utterly prostrat

"Just so; and we don't mean to. But I
wish to God your legation was next to

American hiuc-jackets have always been
brothers. But I am sorry to say there is
little love lost between my men and thpse
of my neighbor Samovar."
"We have put our hand to the plow

fctates Minister with his* quiet smile.
"Mr. Conger." said Sir Claude Macdon

pare for the worst. I certaini" did not
quite realize the magnitude of Tuan's
preparations when I determined to hoid
the legation and I see now that if Sey
mour is defeated we stand a poor chance
cf petting out of Peking alive."
Another conversation on the same topic
may as well be inserted here, although
it did not occur until three weeks later,
when the dangers forecast by Mr. Peri
cord had become facts. It was on the 12tn
of June, when Tung Fuh-siang: marched
cut to stop the advance of Seymour's re
lief colurnn, shutting the gates of Fe
kir.g behind him.
*"I shall do rcy part if It becomes nec
essary." the S. (i. .replied, reverting to
the cautious misgivings of experience.
"But theoretically I do not approve; I do
not approve. Sir Claude. 1 shall endeavor
to prevail on Mr. Conger to follow pru
dence rather than valor. I am afraid you
have not calculated all the risks."'
"I, too, am an Englishman." he said
in a low voice as if he were half ashamed
of having spent his life in the service of
China. â¢â¢And I thank God for it."
"We will see this thing through, Peri
cordâyou. I and Conger."
"What is sauce for the goose may be
taace for the gander. I tell you. Mr.
Pericord, that 1 would not miss this op
portunity if 1 had no one but my wife to
thare the risk of it! I am sick cf diplo
macy. I was not cut out for a diplomat,
and the lies and trickery which taint the
very air of I'eking make me almost for

cays of the mutiny, or I don't want to

The two men locked hands; the S. G.'s
eyes were moist.
"WiM clxfi, xny dear elr? You couldn't

The British Minister burst Into a. hearty
laugh.
On this day. the 10th of June, tele
graphic communication with Tientsin was
cut. and the foreigners of legation street
were completely isolated. They were also
completely imprisoned, although they
scarcely realized it. within the walls of
Peking. Prince Tuan had sent secret
orders to the guards cf the gates to ar
rest all runners bearing messages for
Tientsin. Peking was in a state of siege^
from the Boxers without, pending the
claim of their leaders to be definitely
recognized as Imperial officers. Legation
street was in a state of siege from the
populace within, pending the decision of
the court party whether to aefy the world
by permitting their massacre or to avert
war by safeguarding them as hostage*
Prince Tuan, in fact, was only now
showing his hand by demanding that the
Boxers, whom he had organized himself
should be incorporated as a patriotic milil
tla in the military organization of the em
pire. At his back stood the ferocious
Tung Fuh Siang. who had won his spurs
under the eyes of the prince among the
border tribes of Shensi. and was now In
command of the imperial bodyguard of
10,000 rifle-armed Bannermen. The aged
Prince Ching, supported by Yung Lu
commander In chief of the Peking field
force of 20,000 111 disciplined braves, in
sisted that the Boxers and Big Knives
were simply rebels who Bought to en
tangle the government in a foreign war
In order to upset the Ching dynasty and
perhaps accomplish the revolution in
augurated by Kang Yu-wel.
Both parties appealed to the Empress
Dowager, who was in equal vacillation
from different causes. This ambitious
and capable woman, although now *>ver
60 years of age. still clung to power with
the tenacity of Li Hung Chang. For
twenty-five years she had held It un
challenged through the puppet she had
placed on the throne. But since the
Reform conspiracy of 189Sâ the Reform
party was called the Pao Wang Hui and
owed Its origin to a foreignerâ she could
no longer rely on the Emperor. Kwangr
Hsu. On the other hand, she equal
ly dreaded the accession of Po Chun un
der the masterful regency of his father,
Tuan. Her sympathies were strongly in
"Valda has played me false," M. de
Samovar exclaimed, with a ferocity which
for <Jnce showed the true color of the
Muscovite. # "Vassilich, seek her out; she
Is â " here he whispered In the attache's
ear. "Instead of discovering anything
important at the Superintendency General
she has betrayed our designs to Pericord
and he has play'ed off Prince Tuan
against me. Let the girl be brought back
to the legation, and I will force the truth
from her if my Cossacks have to tear her
limbs off."
Then M. de Samovar played his trump
card. He called on the Tsung-li Yamen
and formally offered to suppress the re
bellion with Russian troops, thus form
ing an alliance with China against all
the wtrld. To his profound chagrin the
offer was refused. On the very dav that
he was to call for a definite reply Prince
Tuan was appointed President of the
Board of Foreign Affairs in supersession
of Prince Ching. Russia's diplomacy,
steadily pursued with a single purpose
since the seizure cf Port Arthur in 1S35.
was mysteriously defected.
On this day railway communication
with the coast entirely ceased and the
Boxers, joined by the Imperial troops sent
out to quiet them, commenced openly
drilling within sight of the walls of
Fongtai.
No sooner had the legation guards
passed within the walte of Peking, than
the Boxers broke across the Peking-Tien
tsin railroad behind them and burned *he
stations of Fengtai and Huangtsun. The
retreat of the foreigners was N cut off.
Seventy miles as the crow flies separated
them from the port to Tientsin, and the
intervening plains were swarming with
thousands of rebels. On June 5 Rear
Admiral Kempt! cabled to Washington:
"Engagement begun." He referred ,to a
collision outside Tientsin between the ter
ritorial garrison under General N!eh anJ
the Boxers. He little thought that his
pregnant words announced the com
mencement of war between China and
tne world.
"This is the most fatal- mistake which
has over been perpetrated by the foreign
envoys." he said to Cinderpan sadly, "and
their mistakes havenot been tew. I fore
see the gravest consequences from this
move. It reduces the chances of con
ciliating the court party, doubles the oc
casions for precipitating a riot and in
creases the security of me legations not at
all. I have done my best. I have berged
them personally to withdraw temporarily
to Tientsin with their families, not in the
way of flxeht, but as a warning to the
TsiT-g-li \amen that friendly intercourse
cannot be maintained with a Government
'which is un.ible to police the streets of its
oTvn capital. One Minister â and I need
not specify -Â»-h:ch one â treated my Â«uggt-s
tiori wnh scorn; he weat bo Ear as to Mint
that I desired to get rid of him in or-ler
to pose as the sole representative of the
united powers. Alas, this wretched ieal
ou.sy will indeed sucered in ruining me. In
a way that ne leas; faresees But i can
do nothing more."
The S. G. acted, however, with his
usual firmness and promptitude. While
all the legations were busy converting?
their compounds into forts and pos'ing
armed sentinels at the gates, the Super
intendency General maintained its aspect
of peace. The staff was forbidden to go
abroad or to carry arms. The Commis
sioners at t_he thirty treaty ports ; wÂ«rÂ«
instructed by telegraph to maintain a
strictly neutral attitude in case of riots,
an injunction particularly necessary, as
in most of these ports tne revenue staffs
form the bulk of the able-bodied residents,
and number many young men of a par
ticular bellicose temperament. And final
ly Mr. Periccrd handed in to the Beard
of Revenue his quarterly statement.
â¢ showing receipts amounting to naarly ten
million* of dollars. Unfortunately, he
wus not able to accompany the statement
with the cash, as nearly the whole of
this fine revenue was written off in pay
ment of interest on the Japanese war
leans, forced on China by Russia.
When Mr. Pericord was informed of
this move, a look o! depression overspread
his face. "The S. G. begins to show hi3
age." was the remark of more than one
of his staff. It was not age. but the in
fallible clairvoyance of an Intellect in its
prime which wrote its deep mark of care
en that tranquil countenance.
ThÂ»?n, and then only, did the tardy Min
isters wake to the reality of their danger
C.ithough one among them probably de
layed tiil the last on purpose.) They tele
graphed for reinforcements to the ordi
nary legation guards. On June 1, hav
ing traveled by rail, 350 foreign blue
jackets, drawing rive machine guns by
hand, passed under the gloomy tunnel of
ths Peking wall, watched by a dense
crowd cf natives In unbroken" silence. Of
theÂ«e 63 were Americans, 73 British, 7J
French. 75 Russian. 42 Italian and 2o
Japanese. Being mustered from their

British Minister did not appear disturbed
by this.

-od of May was the .signal for the mas
sacre of all the native Christians in the
capital city of Paottng, . ninety miles
south of Peking, and the tearing up of
the railroad in course of construction
there. On the C7th the station of Liuiing,
thirty miles from Peking, was burned to
the ground and a oarty of thirty Bel
gian engineers forced to flee for their
live*. On the 28th a temporary interrup
tion was caused in railroad communica
tion between Peking and Tientsin and
the united sects of Boxers, a Chili or
ganization directly founded by Prince
Tuan, and Big Knives, a Shantung or

A howl of good-natured execration wel

But almost on the heels of the first tele

were as follows:

20th of July, after the lesson administered
by the capture of Tient5in by the allies
and the entire defeat of Tung's troops by
the legation guaras. the Chinese Govern
ment graciously vouchsafed permission to
the foreign Ministers to communicate with
their respective homes. The Commission
er at Shanghai, and Indeed the revenue
service all over China, was awaiting news
regarding the safetv of the superintend
ent general with more anxiety than any.
Foreign Office awaited news of a diplo
matic representative. Apart from the per
sonal love and veneration of their chief,
the entire careers of a thousand foreign
ers depended on this news.
When, therefore, a telegram arrived
from Chinan. addressed in the familiar
code word "Custos." the rumor ran
around the general office, the opium desk,
the import desk, the export desk, thai,
transit pass desk, the half duty (coast

statistical department like a streak of
lightning, and almost before the envied

Commissioner a score of senior and Ju
nior assistants, backed by a crowd of lin
guists and shupana, flocked around the
"foreign gate" of the Commissioner's
cozy office to hear the momentous news.
Mr. B broke the envelope in thÂ»
midst of a pin-drop silence. He glanced
over the telegram.
"This concerns you. I think. Kopsch,"
he said, passing it carelessly to the sta
tistical secretary.

"Oh, my God. forgive me! Do not tell
me anything. If I can serve you . . .
What elseâ what else have I to live for
except to show how I love you, Valda?"
"Men have strange ways of proving
thelx love," she murmured.
"There Is at least one way â¢which is
common to all honorable men. With the
deepest humility, Valdaâ I am not worthy
of you. I am a disgraced and penniless
man â but I place my life and my heart at

Valda turned her head and save him one
quick, full glance. In which there was a
trace of tender mockery.
"You do not say anything. Valda. May
I dare to hope "
"That I have forgotten. Hr. Pericord?
I shall never do that, Alan."
"Ah:" perhaps Blake had forgotten. It
is not easy for a young man to remember

turned her tired little pony at a walk,

Blake sent his big black with one bour.d

"A woman does not cut off her hair for

"You 5eem almost more beautiful as you

self that it was a nightmare of my imag

"Alan!"
The hapless fugitives turned sadly back
to Peking. Blake sat gazing after them
for some seconds like a man who realizes
that he la an outcast. Then a timid voice
said from behind:
the Chinese city unmolested, but they
were doomed to disappointment. Barely
clear of the walls of the city, they werÂ»
stopped by a mounted man. who conferred
earnestly and la whispers with Baln
bridge. To advance was Impossible. Tha

Klveâ they mu3t trust to himâ he could
not abuse the confidence of his good
friend Blake, for Blake It was and none
other.
When the admirals of the allied fleet
at Taku learned that communication with
Peking was interrupted they dispatched
a relief column of 25j0 men, under the
British admiral, Seymour, to bring the
envoys back to the coast. This column
left Tientsin on the *0th of June, repair
ing the railway as it advanced. It in
cluded 900 British, S00 Russian and 100
American marines, the latter under the
ill-fated McCalla. It was accompanied
by a battery of ship's puns with which,
if necessary, to blow in the gates of Pe
king.
On the SSth of June column returned
to Tientsin. It had effected nothing save
to demonstrate to the Boxers and Im
perialists that the foreigners were not
favor of a war of extirpation against for
eigners. The success of such a war
would make Tuan paramount. Defeat â
and she knew that it would end in de
featâwould ruin Tuan, but perhaps dra?
her down in his ruin. In these perplex
ities she sent a special courier to her old
ally, Li, at Canton, and for the month
which must pass before she could receive
his answer, she immured herself in her
palace and left affairs to fate.
And for seven weÂ»ks. since the hope
ful marching forth of Seymour's column,
nothing had been heard from Peking;
nothing save a host of terrible and con
flicting rumors. The legations had been
'.^ft to their fate, while the world at home
scanned the papers morning after morn
ing with an impotent agony of fear.
What was happening in this hidden city,
so long looked on as a next-door neigh
bor to Tientsin? What was the explana
tion of this mysterious and awful silence,
which had fallen like a curtain between
the outside world and it3 representatives
at Peking?
Nothing so baffling and inexplicable had
ever been read of In history. Only a day's

NOTWITHSTANDING the fact that
every census enumerator . had
carefully prepared Instructions
and schedules, the latter having
printed headings over the columns for
names, ages, occupations, nativity, etc.,
some of the enumerators succeeded in
making amusing and enigmatic entries.
The young women who manipulate the
punching machines in the census office
have found themselves sorely puzzled
over some of these records. _*tiL.
Whenever the punchers found on the
Ecbedules an occupation which does not
appear in the epecially prepared and
printed list furnished by their chiefs. they
are Instructed to punch it either "O. T.,"
meaning "other things," or "N. G.,"
standing for "not gainful." Thus when
an enumerator in Indiana gave the oc
cupation of a man as "drunkard," the
puncher was In a quandary what to do.
Her chief came to the rescue and In-
formed her that drinking - Intoxicating
liquors was certainly not a gainful occu
pation, especially as the next column on
the schedule showed that the man in ques
tion was so engaged twelve months In
each year. She was therefore instructed
to punch it "N. G." The same rule was
followed when other enumerators entered
a woman as an Inebriate and certain men
as topers.
A New York enumerator, who was per
haps something of a sleuth, entered sev
eral men in his district variously 'as
"crooks," "pickpockets" and "gamblers."
For some reason these were entered under
the head of "not gainful" pursuits.
A Georgian who ekes out an existence
by doing chores about the neighborhood
in which he resides will appear in the
census as "odd Jobs." His occupation will
be found very properly under the head of
"other things."
One of the Southern enumerators came
ODDITIES Or THE REGENT CENSUS.
across an invalid who had spent several
years in the South for his health and
promptly entered the sick man's occupa
tion as "traveling for his health." This,
of course, was punched under the head of
"not gainful."
In Pennsylvania an" aged woman was
entered as "occupationâ invalid," and an
other under the same heading as ."para
lyzed."
Each entry made on the schedule being
paid by the Government at a prescribed
rate, an enterprising enumerator in Ohio,
seeking to swell his temporary Income,
sought the resort of a number of Weary
Willies on the outskirts of his town and
entered them. To each of these he gave
the occupation of "tramp, not gainful."
One of the Western enumerators ~piit
down a worthless fellow, known as the
â â ; occupation, loafer;. not gainful; un
employed twelve months in the year."
,.-Â¦ An aged veteran of the Civil War was
entered in the occupation column as
"lives on pension," and another as
"miser," .while still another was reported
In the same- column as. "lives on sav
ings."
Some of the other oddities of occupa-^
tions are given: "Boarding," visiting,"
"not at work" and "musically inclined."
Of course, none of these can be found in
the prescrl ted list of occupations and
they are consequently entered in
the "O. T." and "Nv G." columns:
In many "of the returns from the 4 rural
districts from the South a large number
of children under 1Q years of age ', are re
corded : aa farm * laborers, and 'â¢Â¦ under .the
proper headings it is said that tb'ey are
so employed eight months and attend
school but two months In each . year.
Two Southern housewives appear in the
occupation column as~"does housework"
and '.'minds baby."
Numerous Indians, whose census . has
been taken, appear on the lists as farm
ers, with here. and there a hunter. Gyp
sies are given as ; horse traders and for
tune .tellers,, and; in one instance as "ho
bo." A Kentucky woman, whose hus
hand Is entered as an "Idler," gave her
occupation as "washing and * wishing."
The punchers who came across this entry
remarked that the phrase meant that the
*woman I was [ washing to support her
twelve ? children and lazy Â¦ husband, and
wishing, that; he -would go to \ work and
assist In the maintenance of their num
erous offspring. ! !
In many of the returns from the South
ern States men of means and leisure are
entered in the occupation column as
"gentlemen," and in one instance as
"rich." An Invalid in Illinois la given
occupation 'laid up," and a paralytic
figures in the same column as "has fits."
It remained for a Pennsylvania enu
merator to record a German. 45 years
old, as "occupationâ villain." Whether
this was the enumerator's personal esti
mate of the man or whether the Ger
man himself gave this unique and sug
gestive occupation is not known. Neither
is it known whether the villain was en
tered as "N. G.Â» or "O. T."-Washington

Borne years ago, noting the exceeding
purity of the air in the Mammoth Cave of
Kentucky, some smart aleck thought it
would be a good place to cure consump
tion. A healthy man is greatly exhiler
ated in the cave and tired after leaving It.
So were the consumptives affected: but
the "galloping kind/* galloped the harder,
and the doomed galleries echoed to the
exhilarated coughing of the coughing
kind, and the experiment was abandoned.
It is curious that the establishment of a
sanitarium above ground to which the
marvelous air of the Mammoth Cave
could be piped Is now proposed. Perfectly
pure dry air and sunlight would not be a
bad combination.
Of course the air in little caves ia not
pure or dry. Nevertheless, the late Duke
of Portland, one of the richest men in
England, spent his later years in the cel
lars of Welbeck Abbey, cut off from the
outer world, where the sun could not
reach him.
Elizabeth Browning, too, wrote many of
her finest poems In the cellar of her
house, where she was compelled to live
after her sight had given way.
An eccentric old bachelor in England
once furnished for his own use a smug
gler's cave in Dorsetshire, where he 'could
always be within sound of the many
mouthed sea. Here he lived seven years,
but even here the enemy sought him out.
and he was married and went to live in a
city house. * 1 ;
Most extraordinary of all subterranean
dwellings was that of Saurier, the eccen
tric French novelist. He had in his gar
den a large lake. One day. worried by
noise, he conceived the idea of a study
under the lake with a roof of plate glass.
This was built at considerable cost, and
in that room Saurier lived throughout tho
day. When not busy he had only to look
through the glass and watch the fish.
A cave is cool in- hot weather and warm
in cold weather. You might do worse.
At Granada, in Spain. Is a tribe of gyp
sies who have lived for centuries in a row
of caves that pockmark the great hill on
which stands what is left of the Alham
bra.
Cave dwellers there are still, even in
civilized lands, though they no longer^
gnaw leg bones.
Many fishermen along the north coast
of Scotland live in haad-made caves in
the cliff side, but whether these dwellings
were made in prehistoric times or by the
smugglers one knows not. Theao fisher
men are all of very small stature.
Cave" dwellers, troglodytesâ great, horri
ble, hairy, busy fellows who gnawed hu
man leg bones in the farthest, dimmest
corners of their burrows, growling like
beasts at Intruder*â were pleasing Inhabi
tants of this earth in very old days.

to produce good effects that will not bear

Now I realized why the dogs had been
saved under the shadow of famine. In

"When the history of the siege of Peking
is written the historian may not dwell
upon that barricade, but to the artist It
was a beautiful sight. Rows upon rows
of sandbags made up of embroidered silks
and costly fabrics that would have paid
a king's ransom. The world never saw
such a barricade before and never will
again. The finest weavings from the four
corners of the world went to make It.

Queen Wilhelmina.
Some days later, while the ladies of tho
court were seated on the terrace taking
afternoon tea a large uasteboard box was
brought out. A gleam of' malice danced in
the bright eyes of the young Queen, but
the Countess van R. complained of a sud
den Indisposition and immediately effaced
herself. The Queen Regent uttered a cry
of mingled anger and dismay when the
box was uncovered; then she said coldly
to her daughter:
"Is that for yourself? Could you not
have chosen a shade still more glaring
and vulgar? You forget, my dear, that
though you are fresh and agreeable to
look at, as are all girls of your age, dis

the folds and threw it on a chair, adding

The late Austin Corbin. president of the

say on the subject of quicker communi

"The Introduction of some means of
rapid transit between the two English
speakmff nations, wholly free from in
conveniences, delays and hazards due to
tides, fogs and storms, encountered in
narrow and crowded waterways and
along dangerous coasts. Is of the utmost
Importance to all trans-Atlantic -travelers
who look upon the voyage as a necessary
means to an end. The universal demand
is for the shortest possible sea passage
for travelers and the quickest delivery
of mails." 1 /

him to step aside for a woman as to chal.

He did the latter once. One of the sto
ries that goes Into the files of Black
Jack's history tells how he. pnrtort from
his men, was overtaken by twelve govern
mental Winchesters and he faced then;.
He could hardly have done less. Inas
much as they faced him. but he did far
more. He looked them over coolly and
then took aim.
The "Winchesters took aim, too. One
of them finished hÂ«3 horse. It wont down
ur.der Trim all at once and Â»he felt him
self on the ground and weaponless. The
only thing even thpn that he thought ol
was how to fight on. He never had a
way of thinking long about anything, for"
he never had time. Therefore he rolled
the horse over without delay and picked
up his weapon which it had fallen upon.
He was armed again. It was a simple
matter. All he had to do was to shoot
back.
Some people might think that twelve
against one "would be uncomfortable for
the one. That depends. Black Jack blazea
to fast the twelve that they fell back
astonished and he was gone when they
recovered. In his flight he met a horse
man, took the horse with a polite "thank
you," ami rodÂ« on to Join the boys. It
had really been no trouble at allâ it was
hardly worth mentioning.
The Black Jack gang never allowed an
injury to go unavenged. At the time that
Sid Moore was killed in Arizona 31ack
Jack was very angry. He stormed little,
but that stillness came over himâ a still
ness that the gang knÂ«wâ and he said that
James Shaw should pay for Moore's
death. This was because Shaw had gone
to the officials of the State and reported,
to them that the gang was in his neigh
borhood and the officials had made a raid. .
The raid ended in a battle and Sid Moore's
head brought $1500 to somebody, for that

BLACK JACK is In JaiL
He has been a long time getting
there. He contrived to rob more
than half a dozen postofflces on his
way. to plunder an occasional express car
a* a eide line. Now and then he killed a
xnan who made himself unpleasant. He
always said that he knew he could not
'act lcr.g, but he meant to have his own
way whi!e he did last.
It looks as if the end had come. On
the ICth of August. ISO.*. Black Jack tried
to hold up the Colorado and Southern
train on its way from Denver and the at
tfmpt was a mistake.
It was a iittle after noon when the
train left Denver. It passed Folsom. X.

then ICirehgrabber. -lÂ»e engineer, hap

He did so. By this time he realized that
he was beir.g held up.
J. II. Harrington stepped forward. He
was the conductor and he had already
had one experience of the kind. That 's
how he came to have a shotgun handy.
That, also, is how came to think of
turnlr.gr off the train's lights.
The trainmen were in darkness. Against
the moon-lighted Fky the robber's figure

The officers went to work to find out

Black Jack was the man In hand. What

into Oakland and from there to the of

old woman was about to sign another

will. When she was ask>d If it were her
will she rodtled her hc?.d and the priest
and the physician affixed their signatures
as witnesses.
She went with Madenas to the office of
Attorney Sawyer. She was shown another
will which was materially different fipm
the first. The second will gave to Attor
ney . Sawyer the woman's entire .property
with the exception of the ranch, which
was bequeathed to Madenas.. Attorney

Months passed after the making of the
will, which was brought by Attorney
made and typewritten in the office of At
torney K. D. Sawyer. In th!s will Mrs.
Shirnmins gave all her money, her jewelry
and other personal property to E. D.
Sawyer, his wife and daughters. The
will provided that If the ranch, which
is appraised at J12/X0 and said to be worth
$20,000, were not otherwise disposed of, it
was to be given to Joseph Matlenas. This
unusual provision created considerable
comment among those who saw the will,
as Madenas was left without anything
if Attorney Sawyer felt disposed not to
give him anything. In this will there was
another significant clause which provided
that the sister of the testator, Mrs. Ellen
Osborn, . a woman ' of over 70 years,
was to receive $25 a month.

crisis in her life was rec:hed. She was

Grave Charges of Fraud.
On August 13 she was buried and on
August 14 Attorney Sawyer filed the sec
end will for probate, applied for letters
and gave the customary notice. In his
petition he made the extraordinary asser
tion that as far as he knew the dead
woman had no living relatives, although
in the first will provision had been made
for a sister of Mrs. Shimmins. The will
was filed with the clerk of the Superior
Court of Contra Ccfsta County at Mar
tinez and on August Zl the testament was
admitted to probate.
The priest asked her if she had any
documents of value with her and she re
plied that she did not know, but Madenas
had placed something under her pillow.
The priest felt under hÂ«r pillow and
found the Qrit will w^iich the dying
woman had made. He told her what it
was and at her request he threw it into
the fire. the. old woman saying that she
had made a second -will and had no use
for the first-
After signins this will Mis. Shimmins
went with Madenas to a local bank and
drew out Jlftt). She gave him SX9. for
which he-gave her- bis note. The old
woman thed returned to her home. This
was on July 19. and on August ID she was
dead. She failed quickly after signing
her second will. The Rev. Father Plmen

Attorney Sawyer was seen last night by
a Call reporter at his residence. 833 Bosh
street. He was asked if he cared to roako
any statement In regard to the allegations
made by the contestants of the will. aaÂ«t
replied that he did not know what they
were. The .'nformation was offered him,
but he declined to hear it. He positively
refuse*! to diÂ«cuss the matter, saying de
liberately: "I try my cases in the proper
mannerâ in the courts, and not ia tha
newspapers. '.*
In this contest Rev. Father Plmentel
will be a most Important â¢witness. Father
Pimentel is one of the best known and
most highly respected Catholic clergymen
in the State. He related yesterday the Jn
cldents which marked the destruction' of
the first will jrhich he read, signed as a
witness and subsequently destroyed at the
request of Mrs. Shimmins. He declared
that when he signed the will ha did not
know It? contents, but subsequently that
he had marked the difference between it
and the second will. He waa greatly sur
prised, he said, that Mrs. Shimmins had
neglected to provide for her relatives,
particularly as they are in needy circrsa
â¢jtances. Father Pimentel's testimony will
be nf material value in support of the al
legation cf conspiracy.
This wiH, the complaint alleges, was
signed while Mrs. Shimmins was acting
under the menace of Sawyer and Ma
denas. who pretended to know some hid
den secret of her life and threatened, if
she did not execute a will bequeathing to
them her property, to expose her la her
old age. In fear of such threats, it is
alleged, she signed the will making: Saw
yer and Madenas her heirs. Upon theso
allegations the contestants ask that the
will be declared void and that its probata
be revoked.
In their complaint the alleged heiri
make most serious allegations. They In

Mrs. Shtxnxnin* was insane and having
been obtained by threat. Intimidation and
menace. The contestants charge that
when Mrs. Sliimmin* made the second
will she was not of s<>und and disposins
mind and was mentallv incompetent to
make acy will. It is charg-?# that thÂ«
will was signed as the direct result of
undue influence exerted over the old
woman by Attorney Sawyer and Made
nas.

denas. whom she feared and by. whom she
was dominated. Sawyer and Madecas are
charged with having falsely told; the old
woman that her sister was dead and that
her other relatives did not care for her.
But even here the allegations do not end.
Sawyer and Madenas are further accused
of having poisoned the mind of the old
woman and after taking unfair advantage

PARIS, Oct. 6.â It Is understood that
the Chambers will reassemble the second
week of November. The Government 's
desirous of giving the country a breath
ing space between the Exposition and the
opening of Parliamentary oratory. The
organs of the opposition are already
clamoring for an earlier date, asserting
that the Ministry is reluctant to face the
charges, and the critics seem to be
against it. There Is really no ground,
however, for assuming that the Govern
ment is In any way apprehensive as to
Its postition In view of the splendid sup
port It received on the occasion of the big
banquet to the Mayor? of France.

however, have to meet attacks. General

PARIS. Oct. 6.â The exposition has been
shorn of one of the most picturesque ex

It can now be announced that The in-,

subject, which was so disbelieved on the
Continent and-whl.ch was the subject of

Out of thirty thousand wounded, 29,000
have actually returned to duty. .Such
quick recovery of such a large percentage
of the wounded rather breaks down Baron
Bloch's theory that a modern war is im

it is true that 10.000 British soldiers have

The attitude of the Canadian electors
toward the policy of sending soldiers to

BERLIN, Oct. 6.â Public attention has
been occupied to an unusual degree this
week by the Chinese situation. The news
papers indulged in a lengthy discussion
of the view the question seems approach-
Ing a settlement. A feeling of general
satisfaction has been c*aused by â¢ the
French note, the contents of which were
only published here to-day. It receives
courteous treatment.
A Foreign Office official, discussing the
French note with a representative of the
Associated Press to-day, expressed the
view that the prohibition of the Import-*
atlon of arms to China would be Indefi
nitely prolonged and also held that the
military guard to be maintained at Pe
king by the unanimous consent of the
powers should remain for an indefinite
period. He said that since the powers
now held the Taku fortifications the
question of their demolition is not press
ins:, for they can be demolished at any
time. Regarding indemnity, he said there
was no difference of opinion on the ques
tion of principle which will prevail,
though the details will require discussion.
Certain newspapers criticise the omission
of the word "International" In M. Del
casse's proposal of a permanent military
occupation of the district between Peking
and Tientsin, expressing the opinion that
tho omission indicates that Russia will
insist upon sole proprietary rights to the
district, upon the ground that her admin
istration cf the railroads justifies it.
A Foreign Office official expressed the
opinion that this conclusion was far
fetched, adding: "All the powers are
equally interested in maintaining com
munication with Peking."
The new American note, announced via
London, Is discredited here.
While the latest German note has ap
parently not yot been formally answered
by. any one of the powers, the Foreign
Office here has been informed that they
all agree to It.
The press of various shades of opinion
regard the new German note as the rally
ing point of tlie powers in the present
negotiations. It is interesting at a mo
ment when the powers are exercising
comity toward China to note that Profes
sor Jellinek. professor of international
law at Heidelberg 1 , shows in a law Jour
nal that relations, according to interna
tional law, between China and the pow
ers do not exist since China has never
voluntarily recognized the obligations of

a general impression in England that a
basis of united action by the powers Is

stage has been reached through Lord

with the. new commission sent out by
President McKlnley. Evidently the case
is one of great importance.
The most difficult question which fac*3
the United States In the Philippines is
the question of church property. The
trouble will arise not so much from
church property universally acknowl
edged as such, but from property whlca
may under some title be claimed by the
state. Of this latter class are hospitals
and schools, and it would appear that the
college of San Jose, founded 400 years ago
by Don Estaban Rodriguez de Figuerao,
will attain the same celebrity as the col
lege founded In New Hampshire a cen
tury and a half later by the Rev. Eleazar
Wheelock.
Don Estaban Rodriguez de Figuerao
Â¦was of the breed of the great captain-?
who were the successful agents of Span
ish Imperialism. Of Portuguese blcod, he
was born in Africa, but became a Span-
In 1767 the Jesuits were expelled from
Spanish territory. Their property was
seized by the crown, but as they had only
tho administration of the College of San
Jose this passed into the hands of the
Archbishop as trustee for the church.
Here, however the Spanish Government
intervened, and, claiming the right of
patronage, substituted itself for the So
ciety of Jesus and committed the admin
istration of the college to a member of
the Metropolitan Chapter. About twenty
five^ years ago another arrangement was
made by which the University of St.
Thomas undertook the management of
the college, which arrangement was In
force at the time of the American occu
pation. In August of last year Major
General Otis by personal letter, without
hearing the representations of the college
faculty, closed the course of studies â
medical and pharmaceuticalâ and under
took to confiscate the college and turn it
over to a private society known. as the
Philippine Medical Association. Against
this action Archbishop Nozaleda protested
before the lately appointed United States
Civil Commission, and his protest Is
backed by an exhaustive statement from
Archbishop Chapelle, the Papal delegate.
The whole question turns on the nature
of the right the Spanish Government had
in the college. The United States suc
ceeds Spain in the Islands, but It succeeds
with a difference. In Spanish times there
was a union of church and state; under
American rule such a union is unlawful.
The United States succeeds Spain only In
Spain's civil rights; it does not succeed
Spain in Spain's ecclesiastical rights. The
question, therefore, to be solved is this:
Are Spain's rights in the College of San
Jose â and incidentally In other property
of the same natureâ rights which spring
from the nature of the civil power or do
they arise from agreements and conces
sions made by the ecclesiastical author
ities? The contention of the Filipino Med
ical Association is that the Royal College
About 1640 a dispute arose between the
Jesuits and Dominicans as to precedence.
The University of St. Thomas was a
Dominican institution, San Jose was con
fided to the Jesuits. Fanta. Tomas was
a university, and, therefore, held itself
superior to San Jose, which was only a
college, but San Jose was the older foun
dation anS relied on the dignity of age.
The Jesuits solved the difficulty by ap
pealing to the Spanish throne and obtain
ing permission to call their institution the
Royal College of San 'Jose. It is on this
title that much of the present controversy
hinges.
The college continued to flourish until
the middle of the. seventeenth century,
when a series of destructive earthquakes
almost destroyed Manila. St. Joseph's
suffered much because its endowment was
chiefly in house property, and it received
from time to time, with all other institu
tions, alms from the royal treasury. But
private beneficence was not wanting. The
Bishop of Carmines, an alumnus of the
college, by will dated in 1666, left a valu
able estate to the corporation, which gift
was supplemented in 1711 by another from
the Dr. Don Domingo de Valencia. Â¦
ish citizen and came to Mexico in the ser
vice of the King of Spain. From Mexico
he went to Manila with Legaspi, the con
queror of the islands, and afterward un
dertook the subjugation of Mindanao, ad
vancing the cost of the expedition from
his own estate. Toward the end of the
century the missionary activity of the
Jesuits was at Its height. They had
opened a college and church In Manila In
15?5. and Figuerao was their devoted
friend. It Is not surprising, therefore,
that, while his â¢will provides for the
foundation of the college of San Jose as
an independent institution, one of the
clauses of the document directs "the
Father Provincial that now is or his suc
cessor in the company of Jesus (Jesuits)
to furnish the pupils with sufficient mas
ters," and, moreover, provides that "the
said Father Provincial shall be the pa
tron and administrator of said college,
and that no one can enter therein without
his permission or authority." The college
of San Jose thus began its existence as a
charity or trust administered by the
Jesuits.

COLLEGE OF SAN JOSE.
Pope Julius II, In 150S. granted a still
larger privilege to. the King of Spain
namely, the right of universal patronage
That is to say, in consideration of the ef
forts made to spread the Christian faith
and to safeguard the temporal interests
of the monarch, the King of Spain was
allowed to name all the bishops and
other ecclesiastical officials supported by
the church endowment. The language of
the concession Is sweeping: "We grant
the privilege that no churches be erected
without the consent of the King of Spain
in such islands and continents now ac
quired or that may be hereafter acquired
and we grant to the said King the right
of patronage and presentation for all
churches, cathedrals, monasteries, digni
ties, colleges and other ecclesiastical
benefices and pious places."
The right then to Interfere in church
matters granted by the Popes to the King
of Spain was conditioned on the royal
support and endowment of the churches
Hence when the United States succeeded
the Spanish crown and declared that It
would no longer observe the burden of
the contract It of course lost the favoi
of the; contract. Tho right Of patronage
no loneer belongs to tho actual govern- j
As a historic.il fact the union of church
and state in Spain was based on conces
sions made by the church to the state
and on concessions made by the state to
the church. The famous bull of Alexander
VI.' Riving the newly discovered lands to
the King of Castile, was issued on the
condition "that you endeavor to send to
said islands and continents good. God
fearing, learned, wise and expert men to
instruct' the said natives and inhabitants
in the Catholic faith, and to teach them
good morals with all diligence that may
be proper." The same Alexander also
granted the Spanish crown the right to
appropriate the church offerings or taxes
known as the tithes and first fruits In
their new .possessions, comprehended un
der the common title of the Indies. Again
this concession was accompanied by the
condition that the state should "make a
sufficient endowment for the churches in
the said Indies, with which their prelates
and rectors may be able to sustain them
selves, pay the charges that may be
from time to time Incurred by said
churches, etc." The object of this ar
rangement was no doubt to' secure
the erection of churches with
greater rapidity in the new ter
ritories. It will be noticed, how
ever, that the church gave value to the
state for the money received. The tithe a
purely ecclesiastical tax, and the first
fruits, a kind of . succession duty on
church positions, payable to the "Holy
See, yielded no small revenue.
Of course the fact that a nation enters
into such an agreement with the church
implies that such nation considers the
church a society capable of making such
a treaty. Other peoples may think other
wise, but the contracting nation admits
the sovereign independence of the church
when it makes a concordat, and when by
the terms of such a concordat certain
privileges in matters of religion are grant
ed the state the state confesses that It
does not hold such privileges of its native
and natural right, but of the grace and
grant olVthe church In whose jurisdiction
they naturally originate.
To understand the argument of the
Archbishops It Is necessary to explain the
nature of the union of church and state
as it existed in Spain. In the canon law
of the Catholic church the fundamental
idea is that the church is a supreme and
independent society in spiritual affairs,
while the state is a supreme and inde
pendent society !n temporal affairs. Hence
the church is a sovereign power as the
state is a sovereign power. The church is
not a department of the civil government,
but it deals with the civil government on
precisely the same lines as one civil gov
ernment would deal with another. The
church enters into treaties with the state
as Germany would enter into treaties with
France or England. The Catholic church
has within the present century concluded
about thirty of such treaties or con
cordats with different nations in different
parts of the world.
The main reliance of the Filipino Medi
cal Association appears to be placed in the
fact of the royal patronage. While Fig
uerao in his will makes the Jesuits the
patrons and forbids any authority ecclesi
astical or civil to Interfere with them in
their administration, yet when the Jesuits
were suppressed this condition became In
capable of fulfillment. Now, according
to ordinary church law, the Bishop of the
place is entitled to enter upon lapsed
trusts of this nature and to make such
commutations as may best carry out the
wishes of the founder in the altered cir
cumstances. This the Archbishop of Ma
nila did in 176S. He converted the college
into an ecclesiastical seminary: but the
Spanish tbrone of 1771 annulled his action,
restored the college to the lay students
and claimed the right to succeed the
Jesuits as patrons. The decree was car
ried out. The Filipino Medical Associa
tion claims that this action demonstrates
that the college was considered a purely
civil institution and therefore now under
the control of the American authorities.
of San Jose was a civil institution 'Ike
the State college at Berkeley. The con
tention of the Archbishops is that it was
a "pious work," or private corporation,
-placed in the hands of the church for
administration.

patronage in certain cases it does not fal
low that the United States can take their
action as a precedent. ; V
The question then concerning the case
at issue resolves Itself into this: Did the
Spanish crown claim the right to admin
ister the College of San Jose in vlrtuo
of the civil law or in virtue of the canon
law. The Archbishops claim that the
right arose from the canon law, primarily
from the concession of Julius II, and as
against the ordinary of the place " by a
decree of Trent, which exempts lapsed
trusts under royal patronage from the
management of the local bishops.
This is hovÂ«- the case stands now. Arch
bf.Â«hcp Chapelle traces the resemblance
of the case to that of Dartmouth College
and holds that the le^al principles ap
plied there should hold also in Manila.
Perhaps one of the most significant para
graphs in the delegate's ;>Iea is where he
alludes to the danger that religious rancor
may be added to the race hatred that
now obstructs American sovereignty in
the islands. He says of the Philippines:
"This is a Catholic country. The people
are deeply attached to their religion. Any
outrage perpetrated on their religious
feelings cr a hostile attitude toward the
church of the people would work incalcu
lable mischief. The American Govern
ment will. I am sure, not make the mis
take of England toward Ireland cr of
Russia toward the Poles; it will rather
follow the example of the former in her
colonial policy and of the latter toward
her Mohammedan subjects."
This Is the key of the situation. The
Catholic church will help you to establish
cleiinitely lav.- and order and to advance
the interests of the United States and of
the Filipino people with all her might.
Her moral influence is greater than any
other like force that exists in these
Islands. Should you, for .Instance, take
away the college of San Jose from the ad
ministration of the church on some legal
technicality, if any existed, and I do not
think any can be found, it would be the
initiation of a disastrous policy. The
pleasing of a few men who have sys
tematically deceived the American author
ities, the satisfaction that would accrue
to fanatics by making "Rome howl," as
I the saylngr is, the insult to the church of
I this country, the management of a few
thousand dollars" income â these things
( will not justify the United States In de
! spoiling the church of properties and
: franchises which she has lawfully en
! joyed for years.
tt will be seer, therefore, that this case
13 one of no ordinary interest.
The question of title to church property in the Philippinesâ of which there is a vast amountâ is
one of the most complex confronting the commission of which Judge Taft is president. It has been for
mally raised by the protest of the Archbishop of Manila against the recent taking over by Major General Otis
of the Royal College of San Jose in Manila. The Archbishop's plea for the college is backed up by the
argument of Monsignor Chapelle, papal delegate to the Philippines. As thi3 argument must be taken
as the stand of the church on this important question it has been secured by The Call and, stripped of its
official verbiage, is presented to its readers. A history of the case introduces the 'argument.

WOULD QUASH
THE CHARGES
AGAINST KING
DULUTH, Minn., Oct. 6.â One of the
fiercest tornadoes that ever visited North
ern Minnesota and parts of Wisconsin
struck the edge of the Mesaba range
town of Biwabik, at 4:10 this afternoon,
killing two peVsons, injuring eight and
doing damage variously estimated at
from $300,000 and $500,000. The dead:
JOHN MORIETY, crushed by falling
walls.
MRS. JOHN MORIETT, blown against
tree; head crushed.
The Injured are workmen about the iron
mines, and none is fatally hurt.
The principal damage consists of the
destruction of shaft houses, dwellings
and business houses. The Austrian set
tlement of Biwabik suffered severely.
Twenty houses were blown down in the
district.
Tornado conditions prevailed to-day ali
over Northeast Minnesota. Violent thun
derstorms wero almost continuous. A
great amount of rain has fallen.
The tornado at Biwabik was followed by
a tremendous downpour. The iron mines
which had been flooded by recent rains
and which were getting in shape to oper
ate are flooded again in many cases.
Wlien the damage to the iron mines as
a result of shutting them down is con
sidered the loss from to-day's storm will
be much greater than the estimates given.
The funnel-shaped cloud passed over
Biwabik with a power that was irresisti
ble. 1 It tipped locomotives over, blew
cars off the track and carried them from
100 to 300 feet. Houses In the path of the
tornado were blown to atoms and the fur
niture scattered for miles. The Duluth
Mining Company's shafthouses and other
buildings were blown down. The Drake-
Stratton Company sustained considerable
loss to locomotives and cars. \ *.: -

place against Dr. E. W. King, superinten
dent of the institution, resulted in three
of the five members of the board showing
in an unmistakable manner their desire
to whitewash King. Cnly through the
vigorous rulings of the chairman. Dr. M.
Gardiner, were Carothers' charges saved
from being completely quashed. As mat
ters now stand the three members of the
board pledged to King's support form a
majority and at the next meeting of tho
board, at which the investigation com
menced to-day Â¦will be concluded, there is
but little doubt King will be exonerated.
The charges were pres-ented to the board
by Carothers on June 17 last. Two meet
ings have been held since that time, but
as a full board had on neither occasion
been present the investigation went over
until to-day.
When to-day's meeting opened Attorney
Carothers was not present, but Dr. King's
attorneys, Arthur J. Thatcher and Sena
tor J. H. Seawell, put in an appearance
armed with objections. In place of ap
pearing in person' Carcthers sent a highly
sensational document to the board, in
which he stated that - as he had
every reason to believe a con
clusion had been reached before
hand he decided that it would be In
vain for him to appear in person. " In his
communication, after running over the
charges made by him against Dr. King
and asserting his willingness to produce
the testimony of reputable witnesses to
prove their correctness. Carothers dwelt
particularly on the case of Fred C. Han
dy, King's secretary, who is accused of
employing his political influence to induce
Dr. King to coerce an employe of the In
stitution, David McKlnley. trustee of the
Carroll school district, into appointing
one of Handy's relatives as principal of
that school.
Carothers also cited the notorious In
stance of a disgraceful Intimacy existing
between an Interne of the institution and
a female patient. This case, which at
tracted the attention of Mrs. Eldredge,
a female attendant, and was by her re
ferred to Dr. King, was characterized by
the latter as being peculiar.
To-day's meeting opened in executive
session, during which the sections of
Carothers' report reflecting on Dr. King's
ability were stricken out and Director
Fehnemann of Alamcda moved to quash
the whole proceedings. This proved too
much for even the King supporters to
support, and the meeting became an open
one. For over an hour the board
wrangled over whether or not Carothers'
charges should be dismissed, as he was
not there In person to press them.
"I move to dismiss these charges and
let the board frame fresh ones," said Di
rector Hochheimer of Willows, one of the
King trio. Fehnemann had risen to sec
ond the motion, when Dr. Gardiner â¢ up
set whatever programme, there may have
been by reminding the board that the
charges had been preferred, were before
it. and it had now become Its duty to in
vestigate them.-
Carothers having withdrawn from the
position of prosecuting witness, various
resolutions were presented to fit the case
and finally one framed bv MartinelH was
adopted, appointing a committee of two
to collect evidence for an investigation of
Carothers' charges, to be held at the next
meeting of the board, which will take
place at the asylum on November 9.
Despite the strenuous objections of Di
rector Fahnemann, an epitome of the let
ters sent to-day to the board by Carothers
was included in the charges to be investi
gated. The board then adjourned until
November, when Directors T. Templeton
and A. Hochheimer. whom Dr. Gardiner
appointed the evidence committee, will bÂ«
on hand with their witnesses.

FXOTJB, MILLS CLOSED
DOWN INDEFINITELY
MINNEAPOLIS, Oct. 6.â Nearly half
the flour mills operating in Minneapolis
closed to-night for an Indefinite length
of time. The Washburn-Crosby and the
Pillsbury milling companies say that
sixty per cent of their mills will close,
and it Is also reported that the Consoli
dated Milling Company will discontinue
operations, although it Is not learned how
many mills will be affected.
The officials say the shutdown is due
to the shortage in the demand for flour.
The foreign trade, it is declared, is prac
tically dead, while the preseny stock of
the mills will be sufficient to supply the
domestic trade for some time to come. It
is contended generally that the coming
election and political Influence have to
some extent brought about the sudden
decline in demand and it Is probable that
none of the mills will resume operations
until after election Is over.

nouncement to-day in a speech at a
miners' mass-meeting' at Shenandoah. lie
said he would Issue a call In a few days.
The belief is general that the men will
give a majority vote in favor of accepting
tho concessions made by the operators.
The date and place for holding the con- ,
vention will' be decided upon at Hazlcton
to-morrow by President Mitchell and
other officials of the mine workers.
President Mitchell addressed largely at
tended mass-meetings and reviewed long
parades of miners at Shenandoah this
atternoon and at Mount Carmel to-night.
More collieries w r ere closed to-day, the
most important being the mines of Cal
vin Pardee & Co. at Lattimer. Mr. Far
dee announced that work would be sus
pended at the mines until further notice,
because, he said, the authorities do not
afford sufficient protection to his em
ployes from intimidation by marching
mobs of strikers, a-n<! he therefore would
coase work to prevent injury to property
and possible loss of life.
Many hundreds of striking miners, ac
companied by women, marched to the
I.attimer mines this morning, and, though
they did not attack the workmen or com
mit any violence, they marched back and
forth on the public road near the mines
in such a menacing manner that the Par
dee employes feared attack should they
emerge from their homes to go to work.
In this way the strikers effectually pre
vented the starting of operations, and Mr.
Pardee's decision to close the mine fol
lowed.
Quietness prevailed in other sections of
the coal regions.
The Delaware and Hudson Company to*
day joined with the other operators and
posted notices offering the 10 per cent in*
crease. The Pennsylvania Coal Company
is the only large operator that has not
posted the notices, but President Thorno
has been quoted as saying his company
will agree to whatever the others do.
11AZLETON, Oct. 6.â That the great an
thracite coal strike will be ended In a
short time seems to-night to be almost
certain. President Mitchell's announce
ment this afternoon in his Shenandoah
speech that a convention of anthracite
miners will be held in a few' days for the
purpope of allowing the men to decide for
themselves whether they should continue
on strike serves to remove all doubt
about the matter. All doubt as to
whether the men will receive the 10 per
cent advance Is divided, but there- is a
good number who believe the men will
receive the advance, on belief that the
operators have reached the limit of their
concessions. I
Mr. Mitchell said to-day, while en route
to Mount Carmel, that he would hold a
convention of .his colleagues here to-mor
row to: decide when he shall issue the
call for the joint convention. Mr. Mitch
ell would not say on what date or in what
cltv the convention would be held. The
question of. representation will probably
be decided at to-morrow's conference.
It Is Believed the Strikers
Will Accept Concessions
of Operators.

SAN JOSE, Oct: 6.â "Benny" Ben
jamin, the missing 1 juror in the
Beg-erow murder trial, is on the
ocean, bound for Sydney, N. S.
W. This fact was brought out by
the search msiclfi by Sheriff Langford on
the bench warrant Issued yesterday by
Judgp T^origani Benjarhm sailtd on Thurs
day evening on the steamer Moar.a. He
had telephoned for his ticket from this
city and purchased it on the boat. He
boarded' the 5:3." train here, and on its ar
rival at San Francisco wont at once on
bonrd the ship. With Benjamin is $700 of
money belonging to San Joseans, which
had btPn intrusted to him to pay a num
ber of debts in San Krar.cisoo. Just how
much the defalcation will amount to Is
not known, but it is believed it will come
close to $1000.
There is a mystery surrounding Benja
min's disappearance that cannot be ac
counted for unless it Is family trouble or
Insanity. He haa always been considered
flighty, and once before disappeared for
several days. Not long asro hp embraced
spiritualism, and it is said this aroused
the ire of his family. For a number of
years Benjamin has been acting as pur
chasing agent between this town and San
Francisco. He had a good business and
there was no reason for his leaving.
On Thursday morning Tlenjamin re
ceived a number of sums ot" money from
bu:;ine.ss men of this city. J. H. Graves,
the liquor dealer, gave him $S0; Al Wil
liams, the soda man. $130; A: A. Brown
$360. and others lesser amounts. These
sums were to be used in paying bills in
San Francisco.
Some interesting complications have
arisen over Benjamin's uiFf.ppearance.
The trial of Begerow probably will have

half an hour and almost every sentence
was punctuated with cheers.
Only the army contractors and the trust

what . chance was there for him to get
anything out of it?
BOUBKE OOCEBAN TAXES.
Declares the Question of Imperialism
Is the Paramount Issue.
TOPEKA, Oct. 6.â Bourke Cockran of
New. York addressed fully 5000 people In
the Auditorium In this city to-niÂ«ht. He
arrived here from Kansas City on a
special train and was escorted at once to
the Aualtorium. His appearances' en the
stage was greeted with cheering which
continued several minutes.
When Mr. Cockran was introduced the
applause was deafening. He at one* be
gan the discussion of the question of Im
perialism, which he declared was " the
paramount Issue.
"Upon tho result of tills campaign."
said he. "depends the fate of the coun
try. It means that the United States will
either advance or retrograde and condi
tions become similar to those of medieval
times."
He then went into the history of the
manner in which the United States se
cured its additional territory. He de
clared that the manner In which this
country secured the Philippines gave It
neither a legal nor moral right to their
possession.

"I believe In Almighty God. I bÂ«lleve he
knows the thoughts and purposes of men.
but I am not willing to blame God for
evil thoughts. If I feel in my heart an
impulse to do good I will trace it to God.
If I feel in my heart aa Impulse to do bad
I will not lay It to him.
"You must distinguish between temp
tation and opportunity.- Temptation comes
to do wrong; opportunity comes to do
good ; but you ' at I your peril must decide
whether It- la a -temptation or an oppor
tunity. Temptations havÂ« come In the
past. Sometimes men have yielded to
temptation and fallen from ifcftir high
estates; sometimes they have resisted and
made them stepping-stones to grander
things. The Bible tells us that 1S0O yeara
ago Satan took the Savior to a high
mountain and offered him' the kingdoms
of the, earth If he would, fall down and
worship him: but Christ said. 'Get thee
behind me, Satan.' The Republican party
was taken up on a high mountain and
shown the Philippine Islands, but It did
not have the courage to resist temptation.
Instead of saying, "Get thee behind me,
Satan," It looked up to the Spanish mon
archy and said, 'We'll give you J2 50 for
those fellows.'
"To-day you will find men are preach
lns the pospel of force. I am amazed
when I hear a preacher shouting for the
doctrine - that makes this nation the ex
ponent of brute force. Do they forget
that when the angels came to announce
the birth of Christ" they came not to sol
diers in battle array, but .: to shepherds
who kept their flocks by. night? Do they
forget that It was not a call to arms, but
a message of peace on earth, good wlli
toward men?"
Mr. Bryan : arrived at "Waahlnyton an
hour behind schedule. - He found a wlldl/
enthusiastic crowd of Immense proper-
the stress of their public arguments upon
another issue in order to attract voters
who have been alienated by tneir former
Cuurse. Certain men have sr.atcr.c- at the
excuse thus rendered and now are cham
pioiur.g Mr. Bryan, ail hough four yea-ra
Â«Â»so tÂ£.ey denounced aim wi,_ exceeding
bitterness because of the very auUuile
on financial, social and economic ques
tions which he still openly retains. These
men unite to ftsatst at the triumph of the
rorces of social disorder, of economic dis
rtst, financial dishonor, because, forsooth,
they say that all evils that may befall as
are prtferable to seeing us uphold the
honor of the flag and interests of the na
tion in the Philippines. The arguments
thty advance to justifv themselves are so
extraordinary that it":s difficult to state
th^m coriectly. Bourke Cotkran. lor in
stance, advocates the election of Mr.
Bryan and a BryaxJte House on the
ground that there will stili be a Repubii
can Senate to prevent the newly elected
President and riouse irem carrying out
the very policy which they would have
been elected to carry out. It seems scarce
ly necessary to no more than state such
a proposition. Its mere statement fur
nishes a sufficient commentary en the
part of the party in uenalf of which it is
advanced and the centieman advancing
It.
"Mr. Schurz. than whom no one man in
l$y$ usec mere \iolent language concern
ing Mr. Bryan, is now supporting him. or
what is practically the same tning, is op
posing President AlcKInJey on account of
the .Philippine policy. Mr. Sciiurs haÂ»
tiated "that his blood boiled at our mis
conduct in the taking of the Philippines."
and that hÂ« defies any man to produce
from the history of any civilizen nation
a parallel in point cf ir.famy to our con
duct tcwurd Aguinaidn and the insur
gents. Of course, it is in one sense diffi
cult to produce such a parallel for the
excellent reason that our conduct has
been the reverse of infamous, and there
fore cannot be paralleled by any act of
infamy. But accepting: Mr. Schurz' s term
inology, it may be pointed out that innn-
Iteiy graver criticism can justly be passed
upon the dealings of this nation with the
Sioux and Nez Perces during the admin
istraticn of President Hayes, of which
Mr. Schurz was a member, than can be
passed upon any of our dealings with the
lagals under President McKinley. The
parallel between the Sioux and the Tagals
:s not unfair and Aguinaldo probably
stands abuve Sitting Bull, but he stands
below Chier Joseph, and the Xez Perces.
unlike the Tasals, did have real and
grave injustices cf which to complain
Mr. Schurz was then In power and he
could have then shown the faith that was
in him by striking deeds of the kind
which he now champions in words. If he
is right in his present attitude it was hiÂ«
caty .-it that time to leave President
Hayes' cabinet und join the Greenback
party? Such a course would, of course.
havÂ« br^en an absurdity, but not quite so
gross an absurdity as the course he is
now following. In Mr. Schurz's speech
in this city four years ace. he in denounc
ing Mr. Bryaa and th-? very policies
which have been explicitly reaffirmed in
this campaign, said that if Mr. Bryan tri
umphed it would mean that this country
had 'forfeited its national honor' for
which, said Mr. Schurz. It ought to 'shed
the last drop of blood.' He continued that
the triumph of Mr. Bryan would mean
the 'contempt and abhorrence of man
kind.' and that the nati.n would rot to
death In 'the Ic-athsome stew of Its own
corruption." Of conrse such language re
flects the gravest discredit upon the man
who uses it unless it is warranted bv
facts. If warranted by facts then there
Is not the least shadow of excuse for Mr.
Schurz abandoning the position he took
because of the Philippines.
"I hold that our course in the Philip
pines is both wise and righteous. But
even should any man hold to the con
trary, he would have nc warrant in
leaving us if he ever believed as Mr.
Schurz believed in 1SÂ£Â«5. Â¦ Let Mr.
Sehurz's blood boll 'over the thousand
outrages perpetrated by the savaee ban
bitti to when he would turn the island? â
these infamies being perpetrated not only
upon our own soldiers, but especially
upon the friendly Filipinos â and let him
join with us in bringing peace and true
liberty to the people of the islands
in the only way In which peace and true
liberty are brought to them, and that is
under the shadow of the American flag-.
"This year our opponents 'rest their
hope of success upon exciting revolution
and hatred in one class of our citizens
against other classes. They are striving
to stir up the forces of social ill will, and
therefore of social disorder. Both their
desperation and their lack of conscience
Is shown by the way in which they seize
upon the act cf noble rescue In China
as a justification for saying that now
we will bring the Chinese into competi
tion with our own wageworkers. They
well know that every one in this country
believes In keeping out the cheap labor
of China and in preventing Its being
brought ir.to this country. Every Repub
lican leader Is against letting down the
tars to Chinese immigration. The Chi
nese exclusion act will be enforced as
lor.g as President McKinley Is in the
White House, but our opponents cham
pion a course which would be almost
as bad for the American wageworker as
to let In Chinese cheap labor; that is.
they champion letting in the products of
Chinese cheap labor and driving out th-2
products of American labor. The Demo
cratic candidate for the Presidency, in
his speech in the House of Representa
tive*. January 13. 1S94. put himself for
ward as the special exponent of this pol
icy, which would let in the handiwork
cf the yellow men of Asia against the in
terests of wageworkers of this land. I
ask you to judge by deeds and not by
words, and if you so Judge you will find
that the Republican party is the real
champion of true Americanism in every
shape." -
BRYA27 AT LOUISVUXE.
Concludes a* Day's Work by Address-
ing a Big Audience.
LOUISVILLE. Ky., Oct. 6.â Mr. Bryan
concluded hl3 day's work with a speech
to-night to an audience that taxed the
big auditorium In this city to Its utmost-
Before crossing the river he made a fif
teen-minute speech at JeSersonvllle, from
the rear platform of his train to & large
and enthusiastic crowd. At the meeting
In Louisville Mr. Bryan was Introduced
by ex-Governor J. B. McCreery. It .was
several minutes before the nominee could
be^.n his speech, and the demonstration
paid him was enthusiastic in the extreme,
ilr. Bryan began by scayingr:
"I believe with cur party that imperial
ism i9 the paramount iisue, but If any
Republican wants to believe that some
ether issue is the paramount one. I am
perfectly willing he shall do so If he is
prepared to defend his opinion, but if a
Republican tells you that the gold stand
ard is more important than the standard
of government, he does not mean that It
is. but he simply proves that he has a
very sordid Idea of public questions."
Mr. Bryan then took up the subjects of
trusts. Imperialism and militarism, dis
cussing them along the same general
llnfe aa in previous speeches.
Mr. Bryan will leave at 2:30 a. m. for
Salem, where he will spend Sunday with
relatives. Monday he will begin a cam
paign in Illinois.
Mr Bryan made fourteen speeches dur
ing the day before crossing the Ohio Riv
er. These speeches were made at Plain
field, a small station a few miles out from
Indianapolis; Greencastle. Brazil, an Im
portant nunir.g center; Terra HsÂ»u*Â« Lew
is. LintOK. Elnora. Washington. Shoals
Muchol. Orleans, Saiex.? New Albany and
JeffersonviUe. His audiences were all
large, except at the very small towns. At
such places as Terre Haute. Unton. Sa
lem and \vashinsrton there were multi
tudes of people. At ail the stopping
places great enthusiasm was displayed
and the people followed him recklessly In
crowds The people did. not desert on ac
count of thÂ» rain, and Mr. Bryan Pro
tected himself with an umbrella. Mr
Bryan is standing up wonderfully under
the strain of the campaign, and he laid
when here to-night that he felt better
than he did when he started out.
At Llnton Mr. Bryan said:
"Republicans, you want the splendor of
an empire; we want the happiness of &
self-governing and a contented people.
You want the Americas, trumpet to be

Such success achieved in the face of great compe
tition is an evidence that the crowding of the field in
any department of American activity does not mean
the suppression of an existing enterprise whose man
agers are capable of keeping up with the times. Com
petition has no other effect than that of stimulating
men to stronger, higher and better efforts. Those who
shrink from such efforts are crowded out, but others
advance and flourish. Collier's' Weekly, there/ore,
serves as a very good object lesson in the way of en
couragement to enterprising men, not only in journal
ism, but in all lines of business. There is ample de
mand in" the United States for anything of high ex
cellence, and those who can produce it. have nothing
to complain of in the present or to fear in the future.
In studying the improvement of the illustrated
weeklies of the United States no better example can
be taken than "Collier's Weekly," a comparatively
new enterprise, but one which has already made itself
familiar to cultured readers in all parts of the civilized
world. In its letterpress, its illustrations, its cartoons,
its editorials, and, in short, in all departments of its
work, it ha3 accomplished a genuine triumph, and
Americans can with satisfaction compare It with. the
best weeklies of the foremost literary and artistic na
tions of the globe. ;".Â£?[Â£
WHEN the daily newspapers of the country be
gan to illustrate the news by pictures of a high
order of merit it was believed by many persons
that weekly illustrated papers would soon be driven
from the field. The expectations would have been ful
filled had the weeklies contented themselves with their
existing standard of literature and illustration. Those
that did not improve have been driven from the field,
but a considerable number of them advanced with
advancing dailies and have kept the favor and sup
port of the public. In fact, one or two new publica
tions of the kind entered the contest, and by reason
of wide-awake, energetic and skillful management
succeeded in making themselves known among the
foremost periodicals of the country.
THE WEEKLY PRESS.
Somebody must have invited the iceman to the ses
sion of National Democratic clubs at Indianapolis.
From a promised attendance of 100,000 enthusiasts to
5000 frostbitten citizens is a shrinkage worthy of note.
It will be seen from that statement that the silver
question is as important now as it was in. 1896. The
election of Bryan ..would be accompanied by the elec
tion of a Democratic House of Representatives, and,
In discussing the subject in a recent address at the
opening of the Republican campaign in Iowa Sena
tor Allison began by pointing out that there arc to be
elected this winter a Senator in Kansas, Nebraska,
Wyoming, Colorado, Montana, Utah and- Idaho, and
that if Bryan carry those States it is almost sure the
Bryanites will control their Legislatures and elect
their Senators. He then went on to say:
' "The currency law of the last session was passed
by eighteen majority. Senator Kyle of South Da
kota, being absent and unpaired, did not vote, though
having a consistent free silver record in the Senate.
Senators Lindsay of Kentucky and Caffery of Loui
siana go out of the Senate on the 4th of March, and
both their places have already been filled by Sena
tors who favor free silver. So that by that process
the majority of eighteen would be reduced on a simi
lar vote to fourteen, and standing off Utah against
Pennsylvania (both these States having a seat vacant),
if the' six Senators from the States I have named ex
cept Utah shall be Democratic, the Republican major
ity in the Senate will be reduced to two, and if Sena
tor Kyle should vote for free silver, as he has always
done heretofore, the Senate would be a tie on that
question, leaving the Vice President to cast the de
ciding vote, which he is pledged by his record, by
the platform and by speech to cast in favor of free
silver. The Democratic Senator from Delaware voted
for free silver, and if the Democrats shall carry that
State, where there is now one vacancy, it is fair to
suppose that the Senator elected would be for free
silver also."
ONCE more a warning has been given to the
American people of the menace of Bryanism
to the finances of the country. It comes this
time from Senator Allison, one of the most conserva
tive and thoughtful statesmen of the country. He is
not a man who speaks without duly weighing his
words. He is not an alarmist. He is known to be a
sincere as well as an able man, and the intelligence of
the country cannot.be indifferent to his warning that
if Bryan be elected we shall have to confront all the
dangers involved in the free coinage of silver. .. .

PERSONAL MENTION.
Of the prosperity of the State there is no doubt It
is said the increase of deposits in the Kansas banks
since the doleful days of 1896 has been more than
$25,000,000. Mortgages representing many millions
have been satisfied. It is roughly estimated that the
wheat crop of this year is worth $60,000,000. The
value of livestock has almost doubled since 1896. The
combined value of livestock and agricultural products
has increased in the period to the extent of $112,958,
207. The yield of the wheat fields in certain Kansas
counties this year has been almost incredibly enor
mous. The Topeka Capital says that the combined
value of the last three wheat crops of Sumner County
equals the value of all the farm land in the county.
The yield this j-ear is estimated at $4,500,000, or an
average of $1000 for every family. If townspeople be
excluded the money yield would be. $2000 for each
family. The Capital exultingly asks: "Where is there
another spot on earth where 2000 farmers in three suc
ccssive years raised $12,000,000 worth of wheat alone?"
Upon that showing Kansas ought to be counted as
surely in the list of Republican States. The Bryanites,
however, are working hard, and as Ingalls has said,
you cannot tell the Kansas of November by the Kan
sas of October. One thing appears evident â the men
who stayed at home two years ago can have a ride to
the polls this year if they feel like it.
Bryanites believe the 47,000 voters who stayed at
home two years ago ure Bryanites who were over
confident. They have faith that this year that goodly
host of citizens will go to the polls and vote for
Bryan, who stands for both Democracy and Populism.
On the other hand Republicans are convinced that
calamity has ceased to be attractive in Kansas, and
that those who contented themselves with abstaining
from voting for the howlers two years ago will this
time come out and vote against them.
It wiil be remembered that John James Ingalls once
said: "Kansas is the most variegated bundle of con
tradictions that the world has ever known. When it
is hot in Kansas the mercury in the thermometer
vaporizes in the rube; when it is cold it seeks the in
ncrmost recesses of the bulb; when it is dry Sahara
is an oasis in comparison; when it is wet Kansas be
comes web-footed. And yet, through all her vicissi
tudes, through all her discouragements, through all
the unpleasant experiences that seem by fate to fa 1 !
to the Kansas lot, our name from the first has been
E!i, and we have got there at last. Kansas can prom
ise more in June and pay less in August, and promise
less in August and pay more in October, than any
ether State in the Union. I am here in Kansas be
cause I want to be. I think, if I were not a Kansas
man, I would be born again and become one."
The uncertainty concerning the stay-at-home voters
of 1898 is made the more confusing by reason of the
fact that almost everything in Kansas is uncertain.
For example. Mrs. Mary Ellen Lease, whom every
body expected to see move on from one point of
radicalism to another, has turned conservative and is
supporting the party of protection and prosperity.
So also ex-Senator Pcfler has ceased shouting calam
ity and is going to vote against everybody who does.
The interest in the contest lies in the fact that Kan
sas is changeable. Bryan's plurality in 1896 was
J3,5O9. In 1898 the State gave Stanley, the Republi
can candidate for Governor, a plurality of 15.870, in a
total vote of 288,177. The total vote cast in the Presi
dential contest of 1896 v.as 335.Â°39t so that 47,465
voters were not at the polls in 189S. An element of
uncertainty exists as to the attitude of these 47Â»ooo
voters in the present campaign.
ONE of the interesting features of the Presi
dential contest is the fight in Kansas. Both
sides claim the State as a "certainty," but just
the same both sides rre making the canvass with as
much vigor as if there were nothing sure except the
voting.

plays by the great writers of the world â

srer of thinking that they can learn noth
ing from foreign literatures; if they insist
upon walking down that road they are
bound to land in the prison of Provincial

war, has. happily for - herself, shown a
catholic desire to familiarize herself with
the best that has been thought and said in
the drama of the world.
SO much in the way of evil report comes from
Italy it is gratifying to have an authentic state
ment of facts showing that the nation and the
people are rapidly improving in their conditions, that
evil is diminishing and good increasing, and that
while far from being prosperous the Italians are never
theless making rapid strides toward prosperity and
all that it implies. Such a statement is furnished by
Salvatore Cortesi in the current number of the Inter
national Monthly. It supplies ample reason for the
sanguine hopes of Italian patriots that their country
will soon be rid of some of the heaviest of its bur
dens, and that its improvement will go torward with
increasing rapidity.
Cortesi recalls attention to the fact that it is only
thirty years since Italy became a united nation and
that it is not fair to judge the Italian people by the
standards of others who for a long time have had the
advantages of an independent national government.
He admits that wages are low and that in many places
extreme poverty exists. Thus he notes that in cer
tain localities the peasants cat only chestnuts, many
workingmen have to work from fourteen to sixteen
hours a day; some of the men receive only twelve
cents a day, while the women get but four cents.
Moreover, he says the Italian people pay higher taxes
than any other, amounting altogether to $437,000,000
per annum, which makes an average of $15 for each
inhabitant, while there is a public debt averaging $95
for each citizen, not to speak of city debts and mort
gages on private lands, which amount to over $1,400,
000,000. To these conditions of distress he attributes
most of the crimes of the people, which he admits are
of truly an alarming number. .
Conceding such evils, Cortesi points out there is
another side to the picture. During the last twenty
five years the railway lines have increased threefold
and now cover atout 10,000 miles. Public primary
schools, which in 1870 were 32,384, with about 1,000,
000 pupils, now exceed 60,000, with more than 3,000,
000, while the average of illiterates has fallen to about
40 per cent. Along with those improvements there
has been a marked increase in manufacturing indus
try and in commerce. It is noted that the trade of
Genoa, which in 1870 yielded customs and port duties
amounting to $2,500,000, has so much augmented that
the amount yielded in 1899 was in excess of
$20,000,000.
Wise sanitary laws and the generally improving
conditions of the people have brought down the death
rate in Rome from 41.8 per thousand in 1872 to 15.1
in 1899. Other large cities of the kingdom show an
equal betterment in that respect. Finally it is noted
that with the increasing prosperity and improved
healthfulness there has come a higher intellectual de
velopment and self-respect. There are fewer beggars
than there were of old, and those that remain are
mainly in the poorer and less advanced districts of the
south.
Taking all things into consideration the writer says
no other nation in Europe, even among the most
learned, rich and civilized, has obtained in so short a
time more satisfactory results. He concludes by say
ing: "Historic traditions, climate, education and
heredity are conducive to the lack in the Italians oi
certain qualities which the Anglo-Saxons and Ger
mans possess, such as patience, calm tenacity and a
spirit, of association or combination, but they have
instead vivacity, adaptability, intellectual acuteness
and a less inclination to alcoholism. Such natural
gifts should be sufficient for their complete renais
sance."
THE NEW ITALY.
From the number of "good Democrats" who are re
fusing to support Bryan it would seem that in bygone
years the old party had more virtue in it than it ever
showed in public any signs of possessing.
Men of the type of Carl Schurz and Bourke
Cockran, who are supporting Bryan because of their
opposition to "imperialism," overlook the fact that
Bryan as President would have less power to aban
don the Philippines than to overthrow the gold stan
dard. As The Call has repeatedly, pointed out, the
Southern Democrats are almost unanimously in fa
vor of retaining the islands, and their representatives
in Congress are all for free silver. Thus free coinage
is more vitally involved in the contest than is im
perialism. Bryan may dodge the issue before the
people, but he is known to be almost a fanatic on the
silver coinage proposition, and were he to become
President he would care little about the Philippine
question in comparison with that of overthrowing
what he calls "the cross of gold."
with the Senate under control of men who would act
wijh the Bryanites on the silver question, even if they
were opposed on everything else, it would be in the
power of Bryan to at once force silver coinage and
precipitate financial ruin upon the country. ;
THE Chinese trouble is widely known to have
originated in the popular objection to the intro
duction of a new religion. Though the objec
tionable happened to be Christian, yet it is probable
the same opposition would have appeared against any
creed that was an equally wide departure from the
Chinese philosophy.
The Christian nations have been generally agitated
by the opposition and the outrages it has produced.
It may, however, be questioned whether any of those
has the right to make faces at China. All continental
Europe has had its turn at blood-letting in religious
warfare, and England was not behind. Her Stuart
dynasty, Catholic and Protestant, kept the headsman's
ax and the stake busy for many years in the work of
spreading one or the other form of faith, and men
and women were numbered among the victims. The
Puritans were persecuted into exile and as soon as
they were established in New England proceeded to
take it out of the religious hides of the Quakers,
Papists and others who strayed within their pious
power.
In this country we do not need to hark back to
ancient days for examples of the same spirit that has
set up shambles in many Chinese towns.
Mormon missionaries within the last year have been
clubbed out of a half-dozen States and would have
been killed had they stood upon the order of their
gcing.
Fresher still is the persecution of the disciples of
Jchn Alexander Dowie. Dowie is probably a pious
fraud and may be doing harm to people who have but
little sense. But an incarnation of the fool-killer is
necessary sometimes, and if this New Zealander is no
more than that he may be doing something useful.
There is no evidence that his cult comes within the
list of immoral doctrines. He professes to cure dis
ease by miracle and certainly has the advantage of the
testimony of a great many people who thought they
were ill, took his treatment and now think they are
well. Suppose some stubborn ones, that were really
ailing, have died in his establishment, it is their af
fair.
On the face of his proceedings there does not ap
pear any valid reason for setting dogs on him or for
pursuing his "elders" with hue and cry. The world's
experience has proved beyond dispute that persecu
tion will establish even error, while it is sure to be a
good thing for truth. Christianity ,would probably
have died in its cradle if the Romans had not perse
cuted its believers. Persecution begot in them the
spirit of resistance and the inspiration of martyrdom.
When many have died for a faith its career is assured,
and the persecuted faith finally overcame the great
empire that had smitten it, and led the Roman world
captive to its altars.
Empirical cults and creeds have flourished under
martyrdom. Mormonism never became formidable
until Joseph Smith was murdered by a mob in Carth
age jail. After that his people were strong to conquest
the wilderness and build the most powerful theocracy
of modern times.
Unmindful of these examples the people of Mans
field, Ohio, have turned Boxers against the Dowieites.
Three times recently they have mobbed them, and as
a final act of barbarism caught two of the elders, and.
tearing off their clothing, first mauled them mellow
and then poured soft tar on them from head to heel.
In this plight they were marched through the streets
of that most Christian city, and when rescued by the
police it took hours, by use of all sorts of solvents and
detergents, to get the tar out of their hair and hides
before they could be shipped out of harm's way.
Why should we blame the Chinese for objecting to
the propagation, in their midst, of a new faith when
our own people show exactly the same instinct, and,
in ?ome respects, in the same way?
Xot only are the Dowieites and the Mormons sub
ject to these attacks, for the same spirit seems to have
found new victims in the Dunkards. Now the
Dunkards, of all people, are the most moral, upright
and harmless. They usually live in neighborhoods
where they constitute the majority, and are fine farm
ers and good citizens. They are pedo-baptists, or
feet washers, and take bean soup for the Lord's Sup
per. A few days after the affair at Mansfield a
Dunkard preacher who had delivered an address in a
schoolhouse near Goshen, Ind., was set upon, mobbed
and beaten and pelted with rotten eggs-.
Really it would seem that our foreign missionaries
would better be recalled from abroad and put at teach
ing some Christian courtesy and common decency to
certain of our people at home.
OUR DOMESTIC BOXER.
ACTORS CONDEMNED TO HORSE PLAY
Germany stands undoubtedly to-day the
first country of the world in the arts of
music and war and in the science of phil
osophy (strange collocation!). Moreover,
unless Franco bestirs herself her rival will
soon wrest from her that pre-eminent
place In the art of the drama which she
has held so easily for the last two hun
dreti and fifty years. The French, for all
their amazing excellence, are so convinced
that they have the best of everything in
their own country that. they are in dan-
M- Emll Friend has a charming little
article in the October Cosmopolitan, en
titled "Some New Members of the Come
dlft Francaise," which should be read by
all v.ho do not realize what organization
can do for the drama. His closing lines
contain a judgment so just and so un
usual that they will bear quoting in full:
"The work of these plastic and Inflnltely
lmpressivo artists has led to the discov
ery that Madame Bernhardt's art fs a
violent and a distorted one: that she has
shocking affectations, mistaken a quarter
of a century ago for manifestations of
genius, and that her violer.ee her brusque
ness, approximate vulgarity. And M.
Guitry (compared with M. Claretie's
young men) is as turgid and mechanical
as M. Rostand's drama."
â¢ â¢ â¢
When comes that happy day when some
American millionaire shall wake up to a
realization of ihe monstrous waste im
plied in "John Drew as Richard Carvel"
and shall give us an Endowed Theater
where such waste "would never be toler
ated?
We may be sure that Mr. Drew values
such success at precisely its true worth
nothing.
If It bq true that misery loves company,
San Francisco need not grieve alone â
good material is being wasted In New
York also. When it was announced that
John Drew was to play Richard Carvel,
all who know the book and the man must
have felt a thrill of sympathy for the
unlucky actor. That sympathy Is needed,
as witness this paragraph from the pen
of Mr. Norman ITapgood (Bookman for
October):"* * â¢ The interest lent by the
wide circulation of the novel is Increased
by the novelty of seeing one of our best
actors of society and comedy drama fixing
himself up as a wooden hero, tossing
about common humanity and thwarting
villains. John Drew plays the part with
infinitely more art than is usually wasted
on such material. His first entrance alone,
superbly graceful, is worth more than the
play entire. His skill throughout enables
him to carry oft the rhodornontade as if
he had no conception how absurd it Is.
His sti iking intellectual face, with mobile
clearness picturing every hint of thought
or feeling that the dummy situations
offered, made me wonder how he valued
such success."
Such plays have been far too numerous
on our local stage during the past month.
The Alcazar has been the chief sinner,
but the Grand Opera-house has run it a
close second. Relieved from active compe
tition by the departure of Mr. Miller's
company from. the Columbia, the manag
ers of these theaters would have but fol
lowed the plainest dictates of common
sense by putting on their very best plays
at this time. They would thus have se
cured a fair proportion of that public
which cheerfully paid between $75,000 and
JS0.000 in ten weeks for the privilege of
f-eoinK Mr. Miller's repertoire. Instead of
this, they have given us in this" time but
one play â "The Masqueraders" â that
could draw to their theaters the class of
people that it is best worth a manager's
while to cater to. They have been put
ting artists like Miss Van Buren, Mr. Rey
nolds, Mr. Montaine and Mr. Howard Hall
into roles unworthy of a ten-twenty-thirty
combination. What a waste of good ma
terial!
FEW .things can be more discouraging
to an actor of ability and ambition
than to find himself cast for parts
that tend to degrade rather than to
uplift him In his professionâ parts
that are stuffed with horse-play to excite
the vacant laughter of the ignorant or
with eentimentalism to stir the silly sym
pathy of the neurotic. Yet every actor,
even If he be at the very top of his pro
fession, has at times to endure the in
fliction of such parts and in' so doing ho
will suffer the more keenly in proportion
as his ideals are high. Â¦ The public alone
can help him and they can do this most
effectively by staying away from plays of
the class described.

LADIES' OPEN SEASON
ON PRESIDIO IiHTSS
Several ladles of the San Francisco Golf
Club played a qualifying round over eight
teen holes, medal play, on the Presidio
links yesterday. The round was prelimi
nary to a continuous tournament which
the members of the ladles' annex of the
golf club propose to hold. Mrs. R. G.
Brown of the San Rafael and San Fran
cisco golf clubs, winner of the ladles' cup
in the recent carnival at Del Monte, and
of the last competition for the ladles' cup
at San Rafael, made the excellent score
of 104, securing first place easily. Miss
M. B. Houghton was second with 120,
Miss Maud Mulllns third with 124, Miss
Edith McBean fourth with 126. Miss Flor
ence Ives fifth with 130. Mrs. F. H. Green
sixth with 133, Miss Sarah Drum and
Mls3 Hager tying with 142 each.
The above eight constitute a challenge
class, ln which the holder of any number
may challenge the player immediately
above her; and, if she succeeds ln beating
her, will take the higher place. This sys
tem has been adopted with much success
in other golf clubs, and has been found to
create and maintain a good deal of Inter
est among the. players.
People are never so happy or unhappy
as they Imagine they are.

HONGKONG, Oct. 6.-Destructlon and
looting are prevalent on the mainland.
Two chapels and a school belonging to the
American Mission at Fotukkai. near Ma
cao, of the value of $25,000 have been razed
to the ground. These outrages are the
work of bands of ruffians who hold the
district in terror. The authorities are ab
solutely powerless.
Ruffians Yet Looting.
The report that this Government has
made new proposals respecting the pun
ishment of Prince Tuan is denied by thÂ«
officials, who say that Mr. Conger has
been instructed to report the names of the
responsible authors of outrages and the
character of punishment they shall suffer
and that until this information is at hand
no proposition on this point can be sub
mitted to the powers. It is the purpose of
this Government to Insist upon exemplary
punishment, ln the hope that it will pre
vent a recurrence of the outrages.
But even with the Imperial court far
Inland, the officials say, negotiations will
not be injuriously affected, as the powers
given Prince Ching and Li Hung Chang
and their associates are most extensive,
the Imperial Government having gone so
far as to agree to approve ln advance to
anv terms they may make.
wu Ting Fang, the Chinese Minister
here, eald to-day he had been advised of
the departure of Li Hung Chang for
Peking after a conference with M. de
Giers, the Russian Minister. This shows,
according to the Minister, that negotia
tions will be conducted In the capital. It
Is regarded as probable that when the
final negotiations begin the Russian Gov
ernment â¢will deem it advisable to direct
the Russian Minister to return to Peking.
These negotiations will probably not be
gin for some weeks, as the powers must
unite upon the terms to demand of the
Chinese Government. There is reason to
believe that the opposition of the United
States to agreeing to the proposals of
France to Interdict the importation of
firearms, raze the Chinese forts at Taku
and maintain a permanent guard at
Peking has been Informally communicat
ed to Russia and France.
CALL BUREAU, WELLINGTON
HOTEL. WASHINGTON, Oct. 6.âCon
firmation of the purpo6e of the Empress
Dowager not to permit the return of tho
Emperor to Peking Is contained ln an
official decree published ln Shanghai,
news of which was handed to Secretary
Hay to-day by Mr. Takahira. Japanese
Minister to the United States. The au
thorities had hoped that the pressure
they had indirectly brought to bear upon
the Emperor and Empress Dowager
would cause the former to insist upon
being conducted to Peking. The Empress
Dowager, however, undoubtedly under
stands the effect upon her future should
ehe permit the Emperor to escape from
her Influence. None of the powers Is dis
posed to recognize her as having any
ehare ln the Chinese Government. Cer
tainly the United States has not and will
not do bo. Except to afford her protection
from indignity as one of the members of
the Imperial household, the United States
will not consider her in the negotiations
to occur. It Is regarded as altogether
probable that the Empress Dowager has
been advised of the attitude of the sev
eral powers with respect to herself and
that she fully understands the awkward
position in which she would be placed
were she to permit the Emperor to place
himself under the protection of foreign
nations.

ITS ABANDONED RAILS
Market-Street Corporation Restoring
Streets to .Former Condition.
Brick Plants in Operation.
Principal Field Assistant McGlllivray
of the Board of Public Works went on
a tour of Inspection yesterday to ascer
tain what action the Market-street Com
pany was taking ln regard to taking up
Its abandoned tracks ln various parts of
the city. McGilllvray finds that the old
rails on Montgomery avenue, from Union
street north, and those on Brannan
street, between Sixth and Eighth, havÂ«
been removed and the spaces paved wuti
basalt blocks. On Montgomery avenue
the cobbles have been taken up and pave
ment laid to conform with the -rest of the
street. * The tracks on Powell street from
Montgomery avenue to Bay street, and
on Bay street from Taylor to Stockton,
are also being removed by a gang of
thirty men, and those on Stockton street
will be next attenu-J to.
McGillivray says that extensive grad
ing operations are now being conducted
on Corbett road, near Twin Peaks, by two
concerns which are manufacturing brick
from the red rock quarried In that local
ity. The bricks, he says, are superior
to those made of clay, and are being used
to a great extent ln the construction of
sewers.
Commissioner Manson returned yester

of a month.
A committee of the Grant Avenue Im
provement Club, consisting of George
Lent. A. S. Baldwin and O. F. Burns,
waited on the Board of Public Works
yesterday. It was stated that $2500 had
been subscribed by storekeepers and
property-owners In the vicinity toward
repaving Grant avenue from O'Farrell
street to Bush. Commissioner Manson
thought that the remainder of the money
necessary, amounting to about $4500,
would be forthcoming from the city to
make the Improvement. It Is proposed to
lay the bitumen on the basalt blocks and
cobbles Imbedded on a concrete founda
tion, which will greatly reduce the ex
pense.
Talk Is rather cheap, but some people
have a mania ior trying to monopolize It.

COMMISSIONER MEYERS
DISCUSSES LAUNDRIES
Sets Forth the Result of His Inves
tigations in a Communi- '
cation.
F. V. Meyers. Commissioner of tho
.State Bureau of Labor Statistics, in the
following communication sets forth Â¦ the
result of his investigations ln the matter
of the working hours of laundry em
ployes:
To tho San Francisco Call: Some of the
emoloyps of laundries ln this city and county
have called upon me and have asked my as
sistance ln placing before the public the fol
lowing Information, namely:
That there Is now before the license Com
mittee of the Board of Supervisors of this city
and county a motion which seeks to change the
recently amended laundry ordinance and to
cause the restriction therein now contained as
to work in laundries between 7 o'clock p. m.
and 6 o'clock a. m. . to apply between 8 o'clock
p. m. and 7 o'clock a. m. instead; that they,
the said laundry employes, protest against this
proposed change; wish the ordinance to remain
as it is now and request all employes of laun
dries to unite In signing petitions addressed to
the above eaM License Committee, asking that
the said proposed change be not recommended.
Further, that the object of . the proposed
change Is simply a desire on the part of certain
laundry employers to be able to require their
employes to work until 8 o'clock at night.
To the excuse for this desire, as given, that
it is unreasonable to require a girl to go to
work at C in the morning they reply that em
ployers are under no necessity which compels
th*m to require girls to go to work thus early;
that any fair employer can get a reasonable
day's work out of a girl between 7 o'clock ln
the morning and 7 o'clock at night, as the or
dinance now is, and that it is Just as unrea
sonable to require a girl to work until 8 o'clock
at alpht as It Is to require her to begin work
at 6 o'clock ln the morning.
That, however. If those urging the change in
cuestlon feel that fairness and protection to
girls employed ln â¢ laundries require that 7
o'clock be substituted ln the ordinance Instead
of 6 o'clock a. m.. It 1b suggested that such
chanÂ»rÂ» may easily be made and still leave the
provision In the ordinance as to 7 o'clock p. ra
the came as It is now.
Hoping that you will oblige these girls by
placing their views as aforesaid before the
public, and thanking you ln their behalf in ad
ranee for the kindness and courtesy, I am
very truly yourV F. V. MEYERS.

The retail liquor revenue licenses issued
by Internal Revenue Collector Lynch to be
delivered at Stockton are stlli among the
missing. A story was published in a
morning paper to the effect that the much
sought for documents had been located in
the office of the Doputy Collector at Mar
tinez, to which place they had inad
vertently been pent. Internal Revenue
Agent Hurt Thomas not only denies that
the papers have been found but says he
has about given up hope of locating them.
While in Stockton a few days ago Mr.
Thomas in speaking to a broker about
the missing licenses remarked that there
was a vague possibility that they might
have been sent to tho Deputy Collector at
Martinez and that the recipient might
have carelessly thrown the envelopes into
some pigeon hole, thinking that they con
tained blank forms, in which event there
was a chance for their recovery. Acting
on the suggestion of the thought, Mr.
Thomas lost no time, but took the first
train to Martinez and hurried to the Col
lector's office. He informed the deputy of
his surmise and together they ransacked
the pigeon holes and made an Investiga
tion of every nook and corner. Papers
that had tne accumulation of the dust of
former years and documents whose his
tories have been forgotten with the pass-
Ing of time were gone through, but the
missing papers were not among them.
The deputy studied long and hard and
racked his brain in an endeavor to recall
having received any envelopes that were
not opened by him, but without avail. .

Chief J. R. Dunn of the Chinese bureau
will start for Washington to-morrow
whither he has been summoned by Na
tional Immigration Commissioner Pow
derly for consultation on matters apper
taining to the efficiency of the bureau,
looking toward the more effectual thwart
ing of the schemes of the Chinese coolie
importers and their allies. Chief Dunn
will spend his vacation in the State of
Ohio, where his home is, and will vote
there for the McKlnley and Roosevelt
electors. He has recommended to tne
Acting Collector of Customs the appoint
ment of Chinese Inspector Barbour to
manage the bureau in his absence.
Ir Is rumored persistently in political
circles that Chief DunrrÂ»wlll be appointed
by tho Secretary of the Treasury and by
National Commissioner Powderly to take
full charge of the enforcement of the
Chinese exclusion act at this port, tnus
relieving the Collector of Customs from
the onerous work of passing upon the
merits of Chinese immigrante desiring to
enter the United States. It was thought
at one time that Immigration Commis
sioner Hart H. North would have the
management of the Chinese bureau and
conduct it in connection with the immi
gration bureau, but the later rumor is to
the effect that the authorities at Wash
ington think that the Chinese bureau will
be more efficient with Chief Dunn at the
head and conducted Independently.
The Building Trades Council of this city
has adopted a series of resolutions hlghly
commending Chief Dunn's administration
of the bureau. Among the resolutions ap
pears the following:
The work of Bald James R. Dunn appears to
have been discharged without fear or favor
and under the most difficult circumstances, he
having been subjected to every kind of Insult,
complaint and aspersion, under constant rnen
nce of personal' and official ruin, his very life
threatened by the Chinese and white Individuals
and companies promoting this traffic in coolie
labor.
" The committee appointed by the council
to look Into the management of the Chi
nese bureau reported the following to
show the efficiency of the work of the
bureau:
Arrivals In July. August and September,
1899 l.Â«H
Arrivals In July. August and September.
1900 B13
Decrease In arrivals for three months.. 914
The committee reported further that
steamers arriving during the three
months last past brought but 35 per ceni
as many Chinese as in the corresponding
period last year.

reau When He Re-

POWDERLY CALLS
CHIEF DUNN FOR
A CONSULTATION
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1900.

To Catarrh, Sufferers.
Every person suffering from catarrh ln
Its many forms knows that the common
lotions, salves and douches do not cure.
It is needless to argue this point or to cite
cases of failure, because every victim of
catarrhal trouble knows It for himself If
he has tried them.
A local application, if It does anything
at all, simply gives temporary relief: a
wash, lotion, salve or powder cannot reach
the seat of the disease, which Is the blood.
The mucous membrane seeks to relieve
the blood of catarrhal poison by secreting
large quantities of mucus, the discharge
sometimes closing up the nostrils descend-
ing- to the, throat and larynx, causing an
Irritating cough, continual clearing of the
throat, deafness, Indigestion and many
other disagreeable and persistent symp-
toms.
A remedy to really cure catarrh must
be an internal treatment; a remedy which
will gradually cleanse the system from
catarrhal poison and remove the fever and
congestion always present in the mucous
membrane.
The best remedies for this purpose are
Eucalyptol. Sanguinarla and Hydrastln,
but the difficulty has always been to get
these valuable curatives combined in one
palatable, convenient and efficient form
. Recently this has been accomplished
and the preparation put on the market
under the name of Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets. They are large, pleasant tasting
lozenges, no that they may be slowly dis-
solved ln the -mouth, thus reaching every
part of the mucous membrane and finally
the stomach and Intestines.
An advantafre to be considered also Is
that Stuart's Catarrh Tablets contain no
cocaine, morphine or poisonous narcotics
so often found in -catarrh powders and the
use of which often entails a habit more
dangrerous than the disease.
Stuart's Catarrh Â¦ Tablet" are nold by
druggists at 60 cents for full-sized pack-
asre and are probably the safest and moat
effectual catarr.fi cure on tho market

WELLINGTON" MINES
PEEMANENTLY CLOSED
Coal Supply Is Exhausted and

a New Location.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA. B. C. Oct. 6â The last pil
lar of Pit No. 5 of the Wellington Col
lieries was taken out to-day and the
mines, which for twenty years have em
ployed from 500 to 1000 men, were closed.
For many years the annual output has
averaged about 200,000 tons, but a few
years ago R. Dunsmuir & Sons, the
owners, saw the supply would soon be ex
hausted and beg'an to look for a new lo
cation. This was found at Wellington
Extension, and as pit after pit at Welling
ton was worked out, new pits were
opened at Extension, and the men em
ployed at Wellington were transferred
there. Some months ago the shipping
point was changed from Departure Bay
to the new town of Ladysmith, and ex
tensive bunkers were erected at the latter
place.
Six pits were being worked at Welling
ton, but all are now abandoned and the
water Is coming ,in without hindrance.
The machinery, will be taken out and used
at the Extension.' What was a year ago
a prosperous mining town of a few thou
sand people, is to-day deserted and the
whole population . of Wellington consists
oÂ» a few employes at the railway car
shops. Even these will be removed at
the beginning of the year to Ladysmith.

THE fair in aid of St. Brigid'a
opened last evening in the Pa
vilion with a glitter and rush that
promises a great success 'and big
pots of money for the church. It
is one cf the prettiest falre that
has ever been Â¦ held here. It is
: original in idea and design and taste
i ful in execution, and the ladies who have
had the preparations in their charge may
well be proud of their work.
Tho fair occupies but half of the art
gallery of the Pavilion, but if the Yittend
' ance warrants it can easily by the shlft-
I Ing of one booth be made to take In the
entire length of the gallery, more than
doubling the space now occupied. Each
booth has a design of Its own from which
It takes its name, and each Is decorated In
colors of its own.
The entrance Is between two large
paintings, one | representing the ancient
city of Jerusalem and the other tha city
of Bethlehem. The boothsâ there are
twelveâ are ranged along each side of the
gallery. They form a picturesque scene,
and each is full of dainty thing's to eat
or to see or to sell. And each is in charge
of a bevy of maids and matrons that make
sure no euest is sent away with a wish
unsatisfied.
The refreshment booth. Is handy ,to the
doorway â the first and the last â and Just
across the way is Its annex, the soda
water fountain, inviting the thirsty to
sample its beverages. They are fitted up
like gardens of palms. It Is the intention
of the ladies of the refreshment booth to
serve a 25 cent lunch every day from 11
to 1, during which time there will be no
admission fee charged at the door. They
look forward to much patronage from the
army of clerks in the City Hall. There
will be no soliciting of trade during- the
lunch hour, so those that come may be
sure of retaining sufficient money to pay
for their meals.
The Cliffs is the next booth, so called
because, of the design of Its front. The
doorway opens through an Immense cliff,
giving all within the appearance of a cave.
The booth is decorated in green and white.
It has a wheel of fortune, a fish pond,
candy and a host of other things. Next
to It is thÂ© Roman Villa, decorated In yel
low and white, and crowded to the doors
with fancy articles of every description.

Preliminary, Hearing of Chief of Po

velops n, Peculiar
j Defense.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VALLEJO. Oct. 6.â The preliminary ex
amination of W. B. Acock, charged with
having assaulted Chief of Police W. T.
Stanford with a deadly weapon with in
tent to murder, was called in Justice
Genty's court this morning. The prose
cution was conducted by District Attor
ney F. B. Devlin, and the defense by
Grove L. Johnson of Sacramento and H.
D. Gill of Vallejo. The caaÂ© has taken a
peculiar turn and bids fair to become one
of great importance to the city of Vallejo.
Acock's defense will be that Stanford Is
not an officer of the law. This means
that Vallejo's charter is to be attacked.^
The witnesses heard' to-day differed as
to whether Stanford drew his pistol be
fore or after having been struck by
Acock. Most of them were of the opinion
that Stanford was attacked before draw
ing his weapon. The case was continued
until Thursday for argument. Acock will
also answer on that date * to the second
charge of resisting an officer. :Â¦Â¦ .-.-

REDDING, Oct. 6.-S. A. J. Eckels, ex-
City Marshal of Bedding, was fatally
stabbed in front of his store In Copper
City last evening by George Veal, a car
penter. Eckels was cut in the abdomen,
the knife making a long, Jagged wound,
and his hours are numbered.
Veal, in an intoxicated condition, en
tered Eckels' store and began abusing
him on account of his politics. The ex-
Marshal tried to quiet the drunken man,
but Veal continued his tirade until Eckels
led him out of the building. Veal returned
and the former scene was repeated. As
the intoxicated man was led out upon the
porch the second time he whipped out a
pocket-knife and slashed Eckels, across
the stomach. The wound was not consid
ered serious at the time. Veal was led
away. Â¦ - â¢< .â¢ â¢Â¦ â¢
. When the serious nature of the wound
he had inflicted was disclosed the assail
ant could not be found. Sobered by his
crime, he had fled into the mountains.
Mr. Eckels was one of tlje - first resi
dents of Bedding, having come here with
the railroad construction crew. He was
Marshal of the city for many terms and
was a noted criminal hunter and a hard
man to handle. â¢ . . ;â¢
Up to a late hour to-night nothing had
been heard of the fugitive murderer.- If
he be apprehended by the citizens of Cop
per City they may not wait for the law
i to take its course.

Weekly Call, Â§1 per Year
It Is in convenient, suppository form,
composed of harmless astringents and
healing oils, gives immediate relief in all
forms of piles and a radical cure without
resort to the knife and without pain or
interference with daily occupation
One strong recommendation for the
remedy is that It contains no cocaine nor
opium and la absolutely safe to use at any
time. >,--..Â¦
One of the suppositories is applied at
night, is absorbed and the cure is natural
and painless.
It permanently cures Itching, bleedinr
or protruding piles and is the only remedy
except a dangerous surgical operation that
will do so.
.All druggists sell a complete treatment
of the suppositories for 50 cents and the
Pyramid Drugr Co. i of Marshall. Mich.,
will mall free to any address a little book
on cause and cure of piles which may be
of assistance In chronic cases.
He continues: However, there is a new
pile remedy which, judging from its popu-
larity and extent of its sale, will goon
taKe the place of all other treatment for
piles. It has certainly made thousands of
cures In this obstinate disease and Its
merit, repeatedly tested, has made it fa-
mous among physicians and wherever in-
troduced. The remedy Is sold by drug-
gists everywhere under name of Pyramid
Pile Cure. .
Another reason is that piles, unlike
many other diseases, is in no sense an
Imaginary trouble. A sufferer from piles
is very much aware of the fact, and for
this reason the few pile salves and oint-
ments, etc., have been short lived because
the patient very soon discovered their
worthlessness.
A prominent physician was recently
asked why It was there are so many
"blood purifiers," "nerve tonics" and
medicines for every ill except one of the
most common and annoying diseases, viz.,
piles.
He replied, there are two principal rea-
sons: ' first, physicians and people in gen-
eral have thought -for years that the only
permanent cure for piles was a surgical
operation and that medicinal preparations
Â¦were simply palliatives and not a cure for
the trouble.

The new mail service between San Fran
cisco, Tahiti and the Marquesas will be
inaugurated on November 1. Hitherto all
the passengers, cargo and mail have been
carried by the barkentlnes Tropic Bird
and City of Papeete and the brig Galilee.
These three vessels have given an excel
lent service, but of course It has been
slow, and In consequence the French col
onies have been cut off from the main
land sometimes for two months at a time.
When Governor General G. Gallet pass
ed through San Francisco several years
ago on his way to Papeete he said that
one of the chief alms of his administra
tion would be to establish a permanent
steamer service between Tahiti and the
Pacific Coast. The roundabout service
via Hawaif, Samoa, Fiji. New Zealand,
Australia and England to France did not
meet with his approval. Ever since then
Governor Gallet has been trying to estab
lish a steamer line between Papeete and
San Francisco. An attempt was made
with the Homer, but it failed. The little
steamer ls a comfortable and well-equip
ped vessel in every way. but she could not
carry coal enough for the round trip, and
In consequence her performance was not
much better than that of a sailing ship.
When the Oceanic Steamship Company
began building its new ocean fliers Gover
nor Gallet began negotiating with the
company for one of Its spare boats. After
much discussion the Oceanic Company de
cided to place a steamer at the disposal
of the French Government, and In conse
quence the Australia will be withdrawn
from the Honolulu run on her arrival here
next Wednesday and placed on the Ta
hiti run.
In order to do this the Oceanic Com
pany has been compelled to charter the
steamer Queen from the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company. The latter vessel
will go to Honolulu for one trip and then
the Zealandla will take up the running
until the Alameda and the new steamers
are ready for service.
The Australia will be- a revelation to
the Tahitian8. She is a modern vessel in
every respect. Her cold-storage plant will
enable the merchants of Papeete to fend
a big lot of tropical frulta to this port,
while a run of ten days will seem nothing
compared with thirty-five and forty days
usually taken by the sailing vessels. Ta
hiti is the "Lotus land" of the Pacific and
a few months will see It the most eagerly
sought after excursion point In the South
ern Seas. 'Â¦
SAIIX>BS ABE STILL SCARCE.
Many Vessels Detained in Port for
"Want of Crews.
The British ships Glencaird and Mllvef-
ton and the Chilean bark Juan Peral are
all tied up In .the 6tream because men can
not be procured to man them. The Owee
na was In the same box for several days,
but fortunately enough sailors were pro
cured for her early yesterday morning and
she got to sea on the first tide. Four or
five vessels now loadlnc at Port Costa
are nearly ready to come down and the
boarding masters are haunting every sal
mon vessel that comes in for men. "Blood
money" is now $40 a man and by the looks
of things It will go to $50 before the week
is out. ' 'Â¦'' Â¦'-',Â¦
The big cannery ship Bt. Nicholas was
released from quarantine yesterday. A
couple of Chinese died during the voyage
down from Bristol Bay and T7ere placed
in pickle. In consequence Dr. Klnyoun
kept all hands aboard until noon yester
day.
It did not take the crew long to get
ashore aa soon as the vessel was released,
but as each man had from $3Â»v. to $500
coming to him none of them were willing
to ship again- for an ocean voyage, so the
boarding masters got fooled. - >
On the Two Brothers, which also camÂ©
In from the canneries Friday night, the
men did not know just where they stood.
They signed to make the trip for $50. but
on arriving at Nushagak demanded $100.
Captain Wilson laughed at their request
and in consequence there was almost a
mutiny. Nearly every man aboard has
been fined and In consequence all the sea
men on the Two Brothers will remain
ashore until the matter is settled.

kinds of news and to operate tickers for
the transmission of market quotations.
The incorporation is effected by the
members of the Board of Trade of Chi
cago and other cities to build and operate
board of trade lines. The company is <>r-
BÂ»TltÂ»ed because of a recent contract be
tween the Foetal and Western Union Tel
t pxaph Company growinp out of the quo
tations of the Chicago Board of Trade to
bucket shops.
CHICAGO, Oct. 6.â President W. S.
"Warren of the Chicago Board of Trade
saJd to-day that the work of construction
â¢of the nÂ« w ts>*=iem will begin as soon as
practicable. Stock will be placed on the
market shortly after Xovi-mbt-r 1. When
â¢ â¢ompleted tiie lines will be 4722 miles in
length.
According to President Warren, the new
company will have exclusive privileges in
the matter of telegraph wires. To the As
sociated l J r< tt- President Warren made the
following statement:
"The project for building a new tele
graph system to connect the various com
dercial exchanges of the countrv has
grown out of the efforts of the Chicajro
iioard of Trade to suppress bucket shops.
Through the medium of the control of.
their quotations. It b->lr.g necessary for
the carrying out of their plan? to have a
teiegraph company which would co-ope
rate with the board, and the existing cuin
panic-5 having declined to accede to cer
tain reasonable conditions imposed by the
board. It was decided to incorporate this
new company, with which the board has
authorized an exclusive contract for space
in their bulMir.g and for the distribution
of their quotations to points which the
Dew company will nach. This will in
clude all iitus where commercial Â«-x
cbaagea exim and other points where the
grain bustnens will justify it.
"A representative of the Exchang-e Tele
graph Company is now engaged in secur
ing: from other exchanpes contracts for
fr*e s--7Â»:!^e and the co-ojjeration of all the
Â«'Xcf::jntrt-s will insure the success of the
new company beyond a pcradventure. as
it is well known that the interexchanpe
business- and the U-asing of private wires
to brokers is the most profitable business
in all the Ji>-!<1 "f t^leprraphy."
Its Projectors Hope, by "Withholding
Quotations, to Effectually Kill

GRAPE-NTTTS.
FEEDS BRAIN WORKERS
A Food Made Especially for Them, j
A literary woman, Mrs. J. C. Roberts, i
193 Holmes St, Dallas, Texas, has dis-
covered that a properly selected train
food is of great benefit to any brain ;
worker. She says: "My duties as jour-
nalist require me to write all day. par-
ticularly in the winter, but heretofore,
after luncheon, no matter how lifrht 1
made it, 1_ found myself incapacitated
for work for an hour or two. for my
brain would not respond to the demand.
"I saw an advertisement of Grape-
Nuts for brain workers and determined
to give it a trial. I am charmed with the
result, z.r.6 am now in perfect health.
I use Grape-Nuts for luncheon, and
never suffer any inconvenience what-
ever, returning to my work at once,
feelinfr as bright as when I left it. I
know from experience that this prepara-
tion is invaluable for brain workers, who
?.re apt to find that that period of time
given up to digestion is one of almost
total eclipse of mental power."
In this day and age of concentrated
effort it is wise for brain workers to use
a food especially adapted for rebuilding
the brain and nerve centers. Grape-Nuts
food was invented by an expert especi-
ally for that purpose. Knowledge of the
food elements contained in the grains
and how to prepare these elements so
as to be quickly absorbed bv the body,
and used directly to replenish the lost
phosphate of potash (which is exhausted
by mental work) have brought about
the result. The proof can be had bv any
brain worker who will take the trouble
to use Grape-Nuts for a few days.

An announcement which I have much
pleasure in making Is that of a second
song recital by Rose Adler Relda, to bo
given October 19 in Sherman-Clay Hall.
A students' recital given by tMe pupils
of Edward Xavier Rojker the other evÂ«i
ing w&s more than usually Â» interesting
from the amateur standpoint. Perhaps
Miss Fritchi's work was- the most: satis
factory. This'; singer has > a sweet;.- full
voice, poise, temperament and a respecta
ble measure of the, dramatic Instinct," and
her interpretations 'were distinctly - good.
Miss Simon, a Boprano, has Â«a voice of
rather rare t'rabre, flexible and well cul
tivated. The voice of Miss Rehfisch. while
of' an unusually rich quality.- is badly
placed, -her enunciation is only indifferent
ly good and her renderings lack distinc
tion. Dr. Brown has a barytone voice of
quality, distinctly above the average, and
his songs. "Egyptian Song" and "Capture
of Bacchus," were given in cultivated
fashion. ., - " Â«
The opening concert of the Mlnettl
chamber music series* took place on Fri
day afternoon last at Sherman-Clay Hall
and was a considerable artistic success.
The novelty produced, a . quartet In A
mln, by M. Ippolitoff-Iwanov, was inter
esting from a pood many standpoints, if
not profoundly impressive from any point
of view. It is rather a negative com
position, impresses as the work of a
quite youthful composer, though M. Ip
politoff-Iwanov Is known already as the
writer of a number of symphonies and
quartets. Russian, of course he is, as
the name indicates, but . only by a. far
Btretch of imagination can one read into
the music the wild, mournful, half-bar
baric, splendidly picturesque spirit of
the Slav, the informing spirit of Tolstoi,
Tschaikowsky. Tourgenieff. the one thing
worth while to the worldâ the native es
sence.
The quartet, however, has dignity, an
elegant correctness, a clever working out
of themes, and In the Instance of the
"Humoresca Scherzando." a sparkling
and brilliant movement. The "Lento" has
also some fine harmonies, reminiscent of
Wagner, however. It was well Interpret
ed by the players, especially in the scher
zo, which was given with all the delicate
brilliance, lightness and general' wlll-o'
the-wisplshness required by the composi
tion. â¢ -' ' !
The Schubert - C â¢ maj. quintet . was also
given, and very well played by the-mu
sicians. It is in curious contrast with- Its
leisurely elegance, ' tranquil -movement,
unhurried atmosphere, to- the strenuous
compositions of these later days. A 1 quar
tet by O. Bolzoni,' and the 'Souvenlr.de
Florence"â a string sextet ''by Tschai

A new Interest In the strange personal

the announcement of the intended pro
duction of his "Symphonie Fantastique"
(for the first time Â«in San, Francisco) by
Max Hirschfeld at the projected sym
phony concert on October 25 at the Tivoll
Opera-house. Perhaps, therefore, an ac
count of' its first production and taken
from the Berlioz autobiography, and told
In the picturesque and exquisitely egotis
tic, style of the eccentric composer, will
not come amiss, lie says:
"It was immediately after this my first
effort at setting 'Faust' (later developed
into the magnificent 'Damnation of
Faust'), and while I was yet strongly un
der the Influence of Goethe's poem, that 1
wrote my ""Symphonie Fantastique' (1S29).
Some portions cost me great labor, while
others were accomplished with incredible
ease. For instance, I labored for three
weeks over the 'Adagio' â scone aux
Champsâ which always affects the public
so keenlyâ and niyseif. too, for that mat
terâand three times gave it up as hope
less. 'La Marehe au Supplice.' on the
other hand, was written in one night.
Still 1 kept on adding finishing touches to
both numbers, and to the whole work, for
several years. The Theatre des Xon
veautes had been playing operas comlque
for some lime and' had a zalr orchestra
conducted by Bloc. He advised me to ask
the directors to perform my symphony
and to help me get up a concert for
that purpose. They agreed, because the
strange programme of the work struck
their fancy, and seemed to them calcu
lated to excite the curiosity of the public.
As I wanted a really great performance,
I invited eighty other musicians, which,
added to Bloc's orchestra, gave us alto
gether ISO performers. There was, of
course,. no accommodation for such num
bersâneither seats nor even music desks.
With the calmness of people who have
not realized the extent of a difficulty, the
managers replied to all my demands by
assuring me that all would be well. â¢ â¢ â¢
"But on the day of rehearsal, when my
130 musicians were assembled, there was
no room for them. The little* orchestra
below had barely space for the violins,
and there was an uproar on the stage
which would have maddened a much more
equable temper than- mine. There was a
; call for desks, and the carpenters hastily
clutched anything which might serve the
purpose: the seen*' shifter went about
swearing at his flies and wings; on one
side there were cries for chairs, on an
other for candles; the double basses want
ed strings; there was no room for the
drums, etc. Bloc and I did the work of
four, sixteen, thirty-two men, but all in
vain; order could not be evolved from
such chaos and it turned into a regular
routâ a musical passage of the Bereslna.
"Still, in spite of the confusion, Bloc
was determined to try two numbers, so
! as to give the directors 'some idea of the
symphony.' and we went through the
'Bal and the 'Marehe au Supplice' as well
as might be with such a disorderly or
chestra, and the latter created a perfect
furor among the players. Nevertheless,
my concert did not take place. The direc
tors were daunted by the disturbance,
and withdrew from the enterprise. They
had not realized that a symphony necessi
tated such elaborate preparations!"
The symphony was . afterward per
formed with acclamation in 1830, at the
Conservatoire, with Habeneck conduct
ing, but the production aroused an equal
measure of blame with the praise.

was sentenced to ten years penal

Chretien retained his usual jovial ex

"It would be a greater incentlve.to fight

her interpretations 'were distinctly - good.
Miss Simon, a Boprano, has Â«a voice of
rather rare t'rabre, flexible and well cul
tivated. The voice of Miss Rehfisch. while
of' an unusually rich quality.- is badly
placed, -her enunciation is only indifferent
ly good and her renderings lack distinc
tion. Dr. Brown has a barytone voice of
quality, distinctly above the average, and
his songs. "Egyptian Song" and "Capture

fashion. ., - " Â«
The opening concert of the Mlnettl
chamber music series* took place on Fri
day afternoon last at Sherman-Clay Hall
and was a considerable artistic success.
The novelty produced, a . quartet In A
mln, by M. Ippolitoff-Iwanov, was inter
esting from a pood many standpoints, if
not profoundly impressive from any point
of view. It is rather a negative com
position, impresses as the work of a
quite youthful composer, though M. Ip
politoff-Iwanov Is known already as the
writer of a number of symphonies and
quartets. Russian, of course he is, as
the name indicates, but . only by a. far
Btretch of imagination can one read into
the music the wild, mournful, half-bar
baric, splendidly picturesque spirit of
the Slav, the informing spirit of Tolstoi,
Tschaikowsky. Tourgenieff. the one thing
worth while to the worldâ the native es
sence.
The quartet, however, has dignity, an
elegant correctness, a clever working out
of themes, and In the Instance of the
"Humoresca Scherzando." a sparkling
and brilliant movement. The "Lento" has
also some fine harmonies, reminiscent of
Wagner, however. It was well Interpret
ed by the players, especially in the scher
zo, which was given with all the delicate
brilliance, lightness and general' wlll-o'
the-wisplshness required by the composi
tion. â¢ -' ' !
The Schubert - C â¢ maj. quintet . was also
given, and very well played by the-mu
sicians. It is in curious contrast with- Its
leisurely elegance, ' tranquil -movement,
unhurried atmosphere, to- the strenuous
compositions of these later days. A 1 quar

others were accomplished with incredible
ease. For instance, I labored for three
weeks over the 'Adagio' â scone aux
Champsâ which always affects the public
so keenlyâ and niyseif. too, for that mat
terâand three times gave it up as hope
less. 'La Marehe au Supplice.' on the
other hand, was written in one night.
Still 1 kept on adding finishing touches to
both numbers, and to the whole work, for
several years. The Theatre des Xon
veautes had been playing operas comlque
for some lime and' had a zalr orchestra
conducted by Bloc. He advised me to ask
the directors to perform my symphony
and to help me get up a concert for
that purpose. They agreed, because the
strange programme of the work struck
their fancy, and seemed to them calcu
lated to excite the curiosity of the public.
As I wanted a really great performance,
I invited eighty other musicians, which,
added to Bloc's orchestra, gave us alto
gether ISO performers. There was, of
course,. no accommodation for such num
bersâneither seats nor even music desks.
With the calmness of people who have
not realized the extent of a difficulty, the
managers replied to all my demands by
assuring me that all would be well. â¢ â¢ â¢
"But on the day of rehearsal, when my
130 musicians were assembled, there was
no room for them. The little* orchestra
below had barely space for the violins,
and there was an uproar on the stage
which would have maddened a much more
equable temper than- mine. There was a
; call for desks, and the carpenters hastily
clutched anything which might serve the
purpose: the seen*' shifter went about
swearing at his flies and wings; on one
side there were cries for chairs, on an
other for candles; the double basses want
ed strings; there was no room for the
drums, etc. Bloc and I did the work of
four, sixteen, thirty-two men, but all in
vain; order could not be evolved from
such chaos and it turned into a regular
routâ a musical passage of the Bereslna.
"Still, in spite of the confusion, Bloc
was determined to try two numbers, so
! as to give the directors 'some idea of the
symphony.' and we went through the
'Bal and the 'Marehe au Supplice' as well
as might be with such a disorderly or
chestra, and the latter created a perfect
furor among the players. Nevertheless,
my concert did not take place. The direc
tors were daunted by the disturbance,
and withdrew from the enterprise. They
had not realized that a symphony necessi
tated such elaborate preparations!"
The symphony was . afterward per
formed with acclamation in 1830, at the
Conservatoire, with Habeneck conduct
ing, but the production aroused an equal
measure of blame with the praise.

JOHN II. CHRETIEN, recently con

mitted in his effort to loot the es
tate of the late Joseph Sullivan,
was sentenced to ten years penal
servitude In San Quentin by Judge Frank
H. Dunne yesterday.
Chretien retained his usual jovial ex
pression of countenance as he stood at
the bar that judgment might be pronounc
ed upon him. "I would rather the sen
tence had been for forty years," he said.
"It would be a greater incentlve.to fight
for a reversal than when only ten years
of retirement Irom active pursuits con
fronts me."
After sentence had been pronounced W.
S. Barnes, attorney for the defendant,
filed a writ of probable cause and notice
of appeal from the Judgment of the court.
On the writ of probable cause Chretien's
freedom will first be sought. It Is con
tended that as he signed a name not prov

crime of forgery had not been committed.
The merits of the contention will be de

event of failure In this attempt an appeal
will be taken.

The cases of Adolph Sylva and George W. SImpton. also
charged with perjury, were called Immediately after Mrs! Cra
ven's hearing. Former Governor Budd> and ex- Judge D. J.
Murphy appeared for them and made extended arguments
on demurrers to the indictments. The cases were continued to
October 27. when Deputy District Attorney Deuprey will reply.
A motion for a formal order denying Nettle R. Craven's ap
plication for a family allowance as the widow of the late
James G. Fair was made before Judge Troutt yesterday, a
written order is required so that the appeal from Judge
Troutt's order denying Mrs. Craven's petition might be per
fected. The time for, appeal expires Tuesday. -
The expense of preparing the appeal will be great, but it Is
said that Mrs. Craven's counsel have arranged the matters of
finance so that the fight may continue. It Is said that the
action will at least be kept before the court until after the
decision on the trust clause In decedent's will has been handed
down. If the tryst is declared invalid tne petitioner hopes to
force a compromise.
Pending the hearing next Saturday the court and the ' at
torneys will investigate the question of whether or not the de
fendant's presence Is necessary during the examination of the
grand jurors. If It Is held that she need not be there, the
hearing will proceed regardless of the court's decision as to
her state of health.
"This situation is very embarrassing," began Judge Cookâ
"Judge, give me a little time to get well and I will be all
right," pleaded the defendant, turning her head slightly, as she
lay on the stretcher. Dr. Clinton and the nurse quieted her
and the Judge proceeded without notice of the interruption
' "All the certificates," he paid, "were made after a single ex
amination of the defendant. As to Dr. Clinton's testimony I
regard it as somewhat colored by prejudice. I do not want
to make an order that will be injurious to the health of the
defendant. I know Dr. A. W. Perry well. He has examined
the defendant and if ho will testify to her critical 'condition
it will have great weight with me. Or If such testimony can
be secured from any of these physicians:- Dr. George Shiels,
Dr. C. F. Buckley, Dr. John Gallwey, Dr. KInyoun or Dr!
Newmark. Put the hearing down for next Saturday, for the
introduction of such testimony If it may be had. The defend
ant need not be in court at that time."
Attorney Riordan said Dr. Perry's testimony could be put in
Monday at 10 o'clock, and the court consented to hear it.
"The defendant's' present condition." Dr.. Clinton said, "iÂ«
that of a critically fiick woman. She has reached a critical
period of life, and for nearly three weeks she has suffered
from hemorrhages. It is against my earnest protest that she
is _here to-day, and I regard her appearance here as dangerous
and likely to set her back considerably.
"Eight physicians have examined the defendant and they
all agree with meâ Drs. Max Solomon, D'Evelyn. Howard, Wil
liamson, Brunnell, Perry, Happersburger and Harrington."
Riordan said that certificates by the physicians had been
filed. Judge Cook said physicians' certificates of Ill-health
would not be accepted as evidence In his court.
Asked by Judge Cook how long it would be before Mrs. Cra
ven might safely appear in court, Dr. Clinton replied:
"In my opinion this woman ought to have an absolute rest
from this torture for three months. If she is dragged into
court every week or so it may cost her life."
Â«â¢â¢â¢.-Â»â¢â¢* i-rn-TTrrT-rrrrrn'YV'n'VVV 0
"Not If I was correct in my diagnosis." was the reply.
"He knows it would." Mrs. Craven said.
Dr. Rethers' testimony corroborated that of his colleague.
He had not thought the defendant's illness was real.
Dr. Clinton was called to the stand. *
MRS. NETTIE. R. CRAVEN was carried into Judge
Cook's court In the Hall of Justice yesterday morn
ing on an ambulance stretcher for arraignment on
the charpe of perjury. Her physician. Dr. C. A.
Clinton, had protested against such proceeding:, as
serting that her life was Jeopardized by it. and other reputable
physicians agr<>^3 with him. But the defendant, believing' that
Judge- Cook would order forfeited the 55000 cash bail in the
event of her failure ti appear, and stung by the Implications
rr.sfle In court and out of it that she was feigning illness to
delay Justice, insisted on being taken into court.
The entrance of the sick woman and her attendants had
about It the solemnity of a tragedy aftermath. Dr. Clinton,
a trained nurse and an additional attendant followed the
stretcher on which Mrs-. Craven reclined. She was carried to
a. place within the railing and the stretcher carefully deposited
there.
Twice during the short hearing Mrs. Craven gave evidence
of a k^en Interest In the proceeding?. Once she turned her
pallid, shrunken face toward Judge Cook and pleaded. "Judge,
jrive mo a little time to get well and I will be all right."
Once she said, with evident anger. "He knew It would," Â¦when
Dr. I>ii5ti? had denied that hip testimony might make the de
fendant's condition more critical.
Mrs. Craven's attorneys. T. D. Riordan and A. Ruef, have
Interposed with a motion to dismiss the Indictment for wirlous
technical reasons: including the allegation that the grandTjurors
were in a state of mind that precluded their acting fairly to
ward the defendant. The motion necessitates examination in
â¢ourt of the grand Jurors.
The proceedings yesterday were devoted to an Inquiry Into
the defendant"? condition, to enable Judge Cook to decide upon
the date when Mrs. Craven must be present in order that the
examination of the erand Jurors may proceed. Judge Cook
was not satisfied with the testimony and written certificates of
right reputable physicians, and set next Saturday for Mrs.
<'raven's attorneys to produce the testimony of other physi
cians.
Â¦yVh'-n Judge Cook read from his calendar, "Cook vs. Fair,"
Attorney Riordan said that the defendant was In court against
The protests of her physicians and that if she were compelled
to bo brought into court again goon her life would be endan
gered.
Deputy District Attorney Deuprey urged that the defendant
rnter her plea, reserving the right to withdraw It later if her
attorneys so desired. Riordan and Ruef would not consent,
and JudVe Cook said It was their privilege to demand consid
eration of the motion to dismiss, but that possibly the de
fendant's presence might not be necessary during the examina
tion of the grand jurors. Riordan doubted if such waiver would
be legal, and Judge Cook said he wanted further testimony as
to the defendant's health before he set the case.
Dr. D. D. Lustlg was called *to the stand and repeated his
testimony given three weeks ago. He told of examining the
defendant September 14, with Dr. Theodore Rethers, and finding
that the paralysis, if any there were, was hysterical in origin
and not organic or dangerous to life.
"I personally thought it wan feigned," said Dr. Lustig. "If
she could be taken frcm St. Luke's Hospital to the Palace Ho
tel of her own volition, why could not she be moved from the
Falace Hotel to the courtroom to answer to the charge against
herr
"Would not your statement," asked Attorney Riordan.
"given out to the world by you as an officer of the court, tend
to injure the defendant's health In her present state?"
Against the protest of her physician, Mrs. Nettie R. Craven was carried into Judge Cook's
court yesterday on a stretcher, on zvhich she lay during the introduction of testimony of physicians
as to her condition. Though Dr. C. A. Clinton's testimony zvas most positive and certificates were
presented from eight other physicians agreeing with Dr. Clinton's diagnosis, Judge Cook was not
satisfied. He zi'as inclined to attach more zvcight to the opinions of Dr. Lustig and Dr. Rethers,

DEATH OF A RESPECTED
CITIZEN AND PIONEER
BY the death in this city on
-Wednesday last, or Commodore
Richard L. Ogden the oldest and
best known yachtsman of San
Francisco Bay passed away. He
was in the Tittles the owner of the then
famous sloop Restless, the first pleasure
yacht seen on these waters." It_ was
brought from New York on a ship ? deck:
In 186S he built the largo schooner-yacht
Peerless, one of the handsomest yachts
ever built here and one that took part In
the first regular regatta ever sa'.led on
this coast. She was sold by-hinrto the.
King of Samoa and became the bamoan
navy." When the San Francisco Yacht
Club was reorganized in 1S75 he was elect
ed commodore, an office he held tor sev
eral voars. About that time Commodore
Ogden also built the line steam yacht
Quickstep and the steam launch Hi- Yah.
Commodore Ogden came to California in â¢Â¦
1852 as a major in the Lnited States army.
He was at that time quartermaster of the
Department of ) the. Pacific, a position
Â¦which he held for about ten years.- That
Â¦was during the Indian wars in Arizona
and the * Northwest. During that period
the supplies for the army for California,
Arizona, Oregon and Washington were all'
provided from San Francisco, and he
handled mai.y millions ofr Government
money. When, he resigned from the army
he became associated with the late ! Wil
liam C. Ralston of the Bank of California
In a number of mining and Industrial en
terprises. He r was for some years man
ager of the Kimball Manufacturing Com
pany, at that time the largest industrial
concern In this city. .At the time: of tne
failure of the Bank of California much of
Commodore Ogden.'s-. fortune*, was Â» lost
when .the ; Kimball - Company, .: went down *
with the other Ralston enterprises. .
Commodore Ogden was always ; a man
of Â¦ affairs, active and energetic In all he
undertook. ; Of a very genial and withal
generous nature, he : will Â« be ; missed â¢ by a? 1
large circle of friends both: in' this city
and in New York. Â¦ He leaves a '.wife and

Commodore R. L. Ogden, One of the Old
est Yachtsmen on the Bay, Passes Away:
FAMOUS BOAT BUILDER
AND FINANCIER IS DEAD
TIGHTLY grasping the hand of a kindhearted Deputy
Sheriff, with his eyes turned longingly on the bag of
sweets held in the. other hand' of the official and ac
cepting the kisses of the aunt who for the past four
years has attended to his every want, without the least
sign of affection, little Montee Ledderhos yesterday bade fare
well to San Francisco and started for the insane asylum at
Napa, condemned by the verdict of the doctors to imprison
ment for life. Enjoyingjjerfect physical health this* little four
year-old boy, instead of romping on the streets and taking an
active part in the pastimes of other children of his age, will
from the moment the doors of the madhouse at Napa â¢ clos2
behind him be as one dead. . , Â¦ ,
A fond mother, whose every heartbeat Is for her little boy
despite, his terrible, affliction, lies at death's door, worn oui
with watching* and constant attendance' upon the youthful
maniac. So serious Is her condition that it was considered un
safe to inform her of the final disposition of her child, though
she knows and realizes that the course taken must be for
the best.
Mrs. Barbee. the aunt of the young maniac, who has de
voted so much of her time In preventing the boy from doing
himself and others harm In satisfying his brutish Instincts,
awaited the coming of Deputy Sheriff Tom Whelan at the
ferry and. turned her troublesome charge over to him. The
little fellow was not a bit backward in transferring his hand
from the clasp of his aunt to that of the deputy, displaying
as the only difference between himself and other children a
reluctance to submit to the farewell caresses. He endeavored
to drop to the ground, but was held up and at a word from
the official accompanied him, seemingly content.
Drs. Lustig and Rethers appeared before Judge Lawlor yes
terday morning and informed him that in their opinion the
child was hopeless!? insane. So free from the least bit of feel-
Ing Is the^chlld that his constant battering of his head against
hard substances has had no other effect than the strengthen
ing of ihe hold of the terrible malady. The doctors said thÂ«
home for the Insane was the only place for him, as his mania
was such that It was unsafe for him to be at large. Judge
Lawlor accordingly signed the commitment and the relatives
of the unfortunate child were notified.
Judge Lazvlor yesterday signed the order committing the four-year-old maniac, little Montee
Ledderhos, to the insane asylum at Napa. Further' examination by Doctors Lustig and Rethers
dwclopcd the fact that the habit of the child in hammering his head against hard substances in his
insane paroxysms had increased the extent of the malady, and that this, in addition to the injury
suffered through a fall when four months, old, matfc his case hopeless. The little fellow was taken
to the ferry yesterday afternoon by his aunt, Mrs. Barbce, and turned over to the care of a Deputy
Sheriff, who took him to the home for the insane at .Napa. The youngster whose case has excited so
much interest displayed not the least sign of feeling on leaving his relatives, seemingly having
a greater interest in. the bag of cakes carried by the official zvho zvas taking him to the madhouse.

, Rest of His Days in a Madhouse.
Yesterday afternoon "Carmen" was
again billed. Signor C. Alessandronl was.
in the cast as Escamlllo, the character
taken by the barytone who had lost Jus
position. The llrst act pleased the au
dience but when the curtain was ruÂ»ig
down Alessandronl commenced his quar
rel with Impresario Azzali. He refused
to tread the boards again unless certain
concessions were granted. His friends
begged "and coaxed, even Carmen pleaded
for his go*od behavior. Manager- Oppen
heimer was dismayed. He consulted
Azalli. Finally ho received a lipâAles
sandronl was only bluffing. If the curtain
went up'he would certainly appear despite
his announcement to the contrary. It was
decided to ring the curtain up. .
Carmen sang and the time- arrived foi
the entrance of Escamillo, but no Esca
miilo came. Carmen sang again and the
orchestra tilled in. the moments, of em
barrassment with bolero music. The au
dience was frowning , by. this time, and
just as Carmen had-'repeated her verses
for the fifth time a happy thought struck
the curtain raiser and he dropped the cur
tain. Then angry words arose behind the
scenes and Manager Oppenhelmer made
his appearance. *
"The barytone has refused to appear,"
he said. "He '. simply says he won't, and
that settles it. .We thought he was bluff
ing, but he wasn't. 'I don't know what to
do about It, but 1 guess you can, get your
money back."
"What Is the matter with him?" came
from the gallery.
"Oh, he's a fool, that's all," retorted
Oppenheimer, blue with rage.
"Go on without him," cried a voice, and
the audience* smiled at the Idea of an dp
era without a singer or "Hamlet" without
a Hamlet. Still, the experiment, was
worth something, and the man who made
the suggestion received many seconds.
Oppenheimer said he was willing if the
audience was. The audience took the
chance. It was later announced that a
Mexic.in barytone would appear, but that
he would be forced to have his lines in
front of him. Even this was satisfactory
to the audience.
"When Alessar.droni learned the name'of
the man who had volunteered to take his
part he became .Icalous. "I will continue
myself." he said, "just to spite them."
The disgruntled barytone sang through
the other acts, but the confusion had not
abated. Occasionally he sang out orders
in Italian to men in the wings, but his
words were not understood b;' most of thÂ«Â»
audience. During the last act a bevy of
chorus singers deserted the stage and
poured their troubles into the manager's
Last night "Norma" was produced' and
went through without a hitch. There is
still strife, and Azzall*says the shake-up
soon to happen In his company. will dis
count that which has been booked for the
San Francisco Police Department.
The- opera of "Carmen" was heralded
as the strongest in the company's reper
toire. Consequently the house was packed
from -pit to gallery "Wednesday night.
Bellagambo 'saw his chance. Between the
second and third acts he made a demand
that If $100 was not immediately paid him
he- would fail to appear in the other acts.
The coin was produced' after much par
ley, but when the audience left the singer,
was accused of conspiring against the
stability of the troupe and was dismissed.
There was a clamor for money at every
hand, but when the management an
nounced that any member drawing salary
at that time would suffer the. fate of thy
barytone only one chorus singer had the
itching palm. He has not occupied space
on the stage since.
The Azzali Italian Opera Company's
record for adventure, distress and ill'luck
Is a marvelous one. Its a'dvent into
America was delayed; Its opening night
was postponed; Its singers became sick
and stopped performances, and mutiny
has now broken out In the ranks. Lorenzo
Bellagambo, a leading barytone, accused
of causing dissension, has lost his Job,
along with a bevy of chorus singers. The
climax was reached yesterday afternoon
during a production of "Carmen," when
a strike occurred behind the scenes, and
Slgnor C. Allessandronl, the barytone who
replaced Bellagambo on the bills, refused
to appear on the stage in. the second act
much to the dismay of the management
and the audience. The events which fol
lowed caused merriment and the Â¦ show
ended In another strike, among the
chorua singers, many of whom walked
from the stage.

The cases of Adolph Sylva and George W. SImpton. also
charged with perjury, were called Immediately after Mrs! Cra
ven's hearing. Former Governor Budd> and ex- Judge D. J.
Murphy appeared for them and made extended arguments
on demurrers to the indictments. The cases were continued to
October 27. when Deputy District Attorney Deuprey will reply.
A motion for a formal order denying Nettle R. Craven's ap
plication for a family allowance as the widow of the late
James G. Fair was made before Judge Troutt yesterday, a
written order is required so that the appeal from Judge
Troutt's order denying Mrs. Craven's petition might be per
fected. The time for, appeal expires Tuesday. -
The expense of preparing the appeal will be great, but it Is
said that Mrs. Craven's counsel have arranged the matters of
finance so that the fight may continue. It Is said that the
action will at least be kept before the court until after the
decision on the trust clause In decedent's will has been handed
down. If the tryst is declared invalid tne petitioner hopes to
force a compromise.
Pending the hearing next Saturday the court and the ' at
torneys will investigate the question of whether or not the de
fendant's presence Is necessary during the examination of the
grand jurors. If It Is held that she need not be there, the
hearing will proceed regardless of the court's decision as to
her state of health.
"This situation is very embarrassing," began Judge Cookâ
"Judge, give me a little time to get well and I will be all
right," pleaded the defendant, turning her head slightly, as she
lay on the stretcher. Dr. Clinton and the nurse quieted her
and the Judge proceeded without notice of the interruption
' "All the certificates," he paid, "were made after a single ex
amination of the defendant. As to Dr. Clinton's testimony I
regard it as somewhat colored by prejudice. I do not want
to make an order that will be injurious to the health of the
defendant. I know Dr. A. W. Perry well. He has examined
the defendant and if ho will testify to her critical 'condition
it will have great weight with me. Or If such testimony can
be secured from any of these physicians:- Dr. George Shiels,
Dr. C. F. Buckley, Dr. John Gallwey, Dr. KInyoun or Dr!
Newmark. Put the hearing down for next Saturday, for the
introduction of such testimony If it may be had. The defend
ant need not be in court at that time."
Attorney Riordan said Dr. Perry's testimony could be put in
Monday at 10 o'clock, and the court consented to hear it.
"The defendant's' present condition." Dr.. Clinton said, "iÂ«
that of a critically fiick woman. She has reached a critical
period of life, and for nearly three weeks she has suffered
from hemorrhages. It is against my earnest protest that she
is _here to-day, and I regard her appearance here as dangerous
and likely to set her back considerably.
"Eight physicians have examined the defendant and they
all agree with meâ Drs. Max Solomon, D'Evelyn. Howard, Wil
liamson, Brunnell, Perry, Happersburger and Harrington."
Riordan said that certificates by the physicians had been
filed. Judge Cook said physicians' certificates of Ill-health
would not be accepted as evidence In his court.
Asked by Judge Cook how long it would be before Mrs. Cra
ven might safely appear in court, Dr. Clinton replied:
"In my opinion this woman ought to have an absolute rest
from this torture for three months. If she is dragged into
court every week or so it may cost her life."
Â«â¢â¢â¢.-Â»â¢â¢* i-rn-TTrrT-rrrrrn'YV'n'VVV 0
"Not If I was correct in my diagnosis." was the reply.
"He knows it would." Mrs. Craven said.
Dr. Rethers' testimony corroborated that of his colleague.
He had not thought the defendant's illness was real.
Dr. Clinton was called to the stand. *
MRS. NETTIE. R. CRAVEN was carried into Judge
Cook's court In the Hall of Justice yesterday morn
ing on an ambulance stretcher for arraignment on
the charpe of perjury. Her physician. Dr. C. A.
Clinton, had protested against such proceeding:, as
serting that her life was Jeopardized by it. and other reputable
physicians agr<>^3 with him. But the defendant, believing' that
Judge- Cook would order forfeited the 55000 cash bail in the
event of her failure ti appear, and stung by the Implications
rr.sfle In court and out of it that she was feigning illness to
delay Justice, insisted on being taken into court.
The entrance of the sick woman and her attendants had
about It the solemnity of a tragedy aftermath. Dr. Clinton,
a trained nurse and an additional attendant followed the
stretcher on which Mrs-. Craven reclined. She was carried to
a. place within the railing and the stretcher carefully deposited
there.
Twice during the short hearing Mrs. Craven gave evidence
of a k^en Interest In the proceeding?. Once she turned her
pallid, shrunken face toward Judge Cook and pleaded. "Judge,
jrive mo a little time to get well and I will be all right."
Once she said, with evident anger. "He knew It would," Â¦when
Dr. I>ii5ti? had denied that hip testimony might make the de
fendant's condition more critical.
Mrs. Craven's attorneys. T. D. Riordan and A. Ruef, have
Interposed with a motion to dismiss the Indictment for wirlous
technical reasons: including the allegation that the grandTjurors
were in a state of mind that precluded their acting fairly to
ward the defendant. The motion necessitates examination in
â¢ourt of the grand Jurors.
The proceedings yesterday were devoted to an Inquiry Into
the defendant"? condition, to enable Judge Cook to decide upon
the date when Mrs. Craven must be present in order that the
examination of the erand Jurors may proceed. Judge Cook
was not satisfied with the testimony and written certificates of
right reputable physicians, and set next Saturday for Mrs.
<'raven's attorneys to produce the testimony of other physi
cians.
Â¦yVh'-n Judge Cook read from his calendar, "Cook vs. Fair,"
Attorney Riordan said that the defendant was In court against
The protests of her physicians and that if she were compelled
to bo brought into court again goon her life would be endan
gered.
Deputy District Attorney Deuprey urged that the defendant
rnter her plea, reserving the right to withdraw It later if her
attorneys so desired. Riordan and Ruef would not consent,
and JudVe Cook said It was their privilege to demand consid
eration of the motion to dismiss, but that possibly the de
fendant's presence might not be necessary during the examina
tion of the grand jurors. Riordan doubted if such waiver would
be legal, and Judge Cook said he wanted further testimony as
to the defendant's health before he set the case.
Dr. D. D. Lustlg was called *to the stand and repeated his
testimony given three weeks ago. He told of examining the
defendant September 14, with Dr. Theodore Rethers, and finding
that the paralysis, if any there were, was hysterical in origin
and not organic or dangerous to life.
"I personally thought it wan feigned," said Dr. Lustig. "If
she could be taken frcm St. Luke's Hospital to the Palace Ho
tel of her own volition, why could not she be moved from the
Falace Hotel to the courtroom to answer to the charge against
herr
"Would not your statement," asked Attorney Riordan.
"given out to the world by you as an officer of the court, tend
to injure the defendant's health In her present state?"
Against the protest of her physician, Mrs. Nettie R. Craven was carried into Judge Cook's
court yesterday on a stretcher, on zvhich she lay during the introduction of testimony of physicians
as to her condition. Though Dr. C. A. Clinton's testimony zvas most positive and certificates were
presented from eight other physicians agreeing with Dr. Clinton's diagnosis, Judge Cook was not
satisfied. He zi'as inclined to attach more zvcight to the opinions of Dr. Lustig and Dr. Rethers,
and finally continued the case till. next Saturday to give the defendant's attorneys opportunity to
secure the evidence of other physicians, whom he named. Mrs. Craven's attorneys have filed a mo
tion to dismiss the indictment, alleging z'arious technical flazvs and charging prejudice on the part
of the grand jurors. The court and the interested attorneys will determine whether the hearing
of evidence on that motion may proceed without the presence of the defendant.

Commodore R. L. Ogden, One of the Old
est Yachtsmen on the Bay, Passes Away:
FAMOUS BOAT BUILDER
AND FINANCIER IS DEAD
TIGHTLY grasping the hand of a kindhearted Deputy
Sheriff, with his eyes turned longingly on the bag of
sweets held in the. other hand' of the official and ac
cepting the kisses of the aunt who for the past four
years has attended to his every want, without the least
sign of affection, little Montee Ledderhos yesterday bade fare
well to San Francisco and started for the insane asylum at
Napa, condemned by the verdict of the doctors to imprison
ment for life. Enjoyingjjerfect physical health this* little four
year-old boy, instead of romping on the streets and taking an
active part in the pastimes of other children of his age, will
from the moment the doors of the madhouse at Napa â¢ clos2
behind him be as one dead. . , Â¦ ,
A fond mother, whose every heartbeat Is for her little boy
despite, his terrible, affliction, lies at death's door, worn oui
with watching* and constant attendance' upon the youthful
maniac. So serious Is her condition that it was considered un
safe to inform her of the final disposition of her child, though
she knows and realizes that the course taken must be for
the best.
Mrs. Barbee. the aunt of the young maniac, who has de
voted so much of her time In preventing the boy from doing
himself and others harm In satisfying his brutish Instincts,
awaited the coming of Deputy Sheriff Tom Whelan at the
ferry and. turned her troublesome charge over to him. The
little fellow was not a bit backward in transferring his hand
from the clasp of his aunt to that of the deputy, displaying
as the only difference between himself and other children a
reluctance to submit to the farewell caresses. He endeavored
to drop to the ground, but was held up and at a word from
the official accompanied him, seemingly content.
Drs. Lustig and Rethers appeared before Judge Lawlor yes
terday morning and informed him that in their opinion the
child was hopeless!? insane. So free from the least bit of feel-
Ing Is the^chlld that his constant battering of his head against
hard substances has had no other effect than the strengthen
ing of ihe hold of the terrible malady. The doctors said thÂ«
home for the Insane was the only place for him, as his mania
was such that It was unsafe for him to be at large. Judge
Lawlor accordingly signed the commitment and the relatives
of the unfortunate child were notified.
Judge Lazvlor yesterday signed the order committing the four-year-old maniac, little Montee
Ledderhos, to the insane asylum at Napa. Further' examination by Doctors Lustig and Rethers
dwclopcd the fact that the habit of the child in hammering his head against hard substances in his
insane paroxysms had increased the extent of the malady, and that this, in addition to the injury
suffered through a fall when four months, old, matfc his case hopeless. The little fellow was taken
to the ferry yesterday afternoon by his aunt, Mrs. Barbce, and turned over to the care of a Deputy
Sheriff, who took him to the home for the insane at .Napa. The youngster whose case has excited so
much interest displayed not the least sign of feeling on leaving his relatives, seemingly having
a greater interest in. the bag of cakes carried by the official zvho zvas taking him to the madhouse.

Yesterday afternoon "Carmen" was
again billed. Signor C. Alessandronl was.
in the cast as Escamlllo, the character
taken by the barytone who had lost Jus
position. The llrst act pleased the au
dience but when the curtain was ruÂ»ig
down Alessandronl commenced his quar
rel with Impresario Azzali. He refused
to tread the boards again unless certain
concessions were granted. His friends
begged "and coaxed, even Carmen pleaded
for his go*od behavior. Manager- Oppen
heimer was dismayed. He consulted
Azalli. Finally ho received a lipâAles
sandronl was only bluffing. If the curtain
went up'he would certainly appear despite
his announcement to the contrary. It was
decided to ring the curtain up. .
Carmen sang and the time- arrived foi
the entrance of Escamillo, but no Esca
miilo came. Carmen sang again and the
orchestra tilled in. the moments, of em
barrassment with bolero music. The au
dience was frowning , by. this time, and
just as Carmen had-'repeated her verses
for the fifth time a happy thought struck
the curtain raiser and he dropped the cur
tain. Then angry words arose behind the
scenes and Manager Oppenhelmer made
his appearance. *
"The barytone has refused to appear,"
he said. "He '. simply says he won't, and
that settles it. .We thought he was bluff
ing, but he wasn't. 'I don't know what to
do about It, but 1 guess you can, get your
money back."
"What Is the matter with him?" came
from the gallery.
"Oh, he's a fool, that's all," retorted
Oppenheimer, blue with rage.
"Go on without him," cried a voice, and
the audience* smiled at the Idea of an dp
era without a singer or "Hamlet" without
a Hamlet. Still, the experiment, was
worth something, and the man who made
the suggestion received many seconds.
Oppenheimer said he was willing if the
audience was. The audience took the
chance. It was later announced that a
Mexic.in barytone would appear, but that
he would be forced to have his lines in
front of him. Even this was satisfactory
to the audience.
"When Alessar.droni learned the name'of
the man who had volunteered to take his
part he became .Icalous. "I will continue
myself." he said, "just to spite them."
The disgruntled barytone sang through
the other acts, but the confusion had not
abated. Occasionally he sang out orders
in Italian to men in the wings, but his
words were not understood b;' most of thÂ«Â»
audience. During the last act a bevy of
chorus singers deserted the stage and
poured their troubles into the manager's
Last night "Norma" was produced' and
went through without a hitch. There is
still strife, and Azzall*says the shake-up

count that which has been booked for the
San Francisco Police Department.
The- opera of "Carmen" was heralded
as the strongest in the company's reper
toire. Consequently the house was packed
from -pit to gallery "Wednesday night.
Bellagambo 'saw his chance. Between the
second and third acts he made a demand
that If $100 was not immediately paid him
he- would fail to appear in the other acts.
The coin was produced' after much par
ley, but when the audience left the singer,
was accused of conspiring against the
stability of the troupe and was dismissed.
There was a clamor for money at every
hand, but when the management an
nounced that any member drawing salary
at that time would suffer the. fate of thy
barytone only one chorus singer had the
itching palm. He has not occupied space
on the stage since.
The Azzali Italian Opera Company's
record for adventure, distress and ill'luck
Is a marvelous one. Its a'dvent into
America was delayed; Its opening night
was postponed; Its singers became sick
and stopped performances, and mutiny
has now broken out In the ranks. Lorenzo
Bellagambo, a leading barytone, accused
of causing dissension, has lost his Job,
along with a bevy of chorus singers. The
climax was reached yesterday afternoon
during a production of "Carmen," when
a strike occurred behind the scenes, and
Slgnor C. Allessandronl, the barytone who
replaced Bellagambo on the bills, refused
to appear on the stage in. the second act
much to the dismay of the management
and the audience. The events which fol
lowed caused merriment and the Â¦ show
ended In another strike, among the
chorua singers, many of whom walked
from the stage.

that ten men had been assigned to assas
sinate each ruler of a state, whether
King, Emperor or President. With ten
anarchists assigned to each ruler, it was
thought that all chances of failure would
be precluded. It is reported tÂ±at a promi

that "there would be such a series of sen
sational sacrifices within one year that
society would stand aghast and be com

unless greater severity against anarchist*

were defeated by Stanford.
Smith, the California left half, and Ro
dolph, the Reliance quarter, were the he
roes of the day, and both men covered
themselves with glory. The game was
called at 3 o'clock and by the time the
whistle blew the campus grounds were
crowded with football enthusiasts, the
college band turned out and the rooters
had a chance to practice some new yells.
The Reliance team had the advantage
of the kick-eff. Moore of California got
the ball and punted it up the field for
twenty-five yards. The ball was then in
the ct-nter of the field and there it re
mained, both teams using bucking tactics
without any material results. Rodolpn
The California men thought they would
certainly win in the second half, as they
were in the best condition and their op
ponents appeared tired out, but in this
Idea they were mistaken, as when the
ball was sent skyward at the renewal of
the game the Reliance men were in good
form and played strong until the close of
the game.
Ift the kick-off in the second half Ro
dolph caught the ball and ran up the Held
with it. He was. caught in the center of
the field a few seconds later. Dinsmore
made a five-yard run, but was splendidly
tackled by Duden. who brought hinfto the
ground. The Reliance team then began
eventually secured the ball and punted
the plRskin up tho field t\venty T five yards.
Shortly after Pm'.th made r. ten-yard run
and the w;.Â«?ijo rooters went wild with
joy. They thought things were at last
cominp their way. but the Reliance boys
held on with bulldog tenacity, and though
the California team bucketl their lines for
all they were worth they were unable to
gain another inch. Dudon gained three
yards with the ball, but lost the ground
immediately afterward. At the close of
the tirst half it was anybody's game, with
the ball in the center of the Held.

SACRAMENTO.
But that is not what made the game ex
traordinarily sensational. In the ninth In
ning the local team came to the bat four
runs to the bad. Hughes, who was In the
box. was invincible for seven innings.
Then Frisco found him, and for a time it
was difficult to follow the ball as It
streaked the field for hit after hit. In the
ninth â¢ the score was tied. After that
Iburg. who had been hit frequently and
hard, settled down, and for three innings
the play was as close as a cheese sand
wich. Two errors, one by Knig and the
other by Eagan, go to show what kind of
speedy ball was played. To cap the cli
max, Eagan repeated his performance of
a few weeks agoâ sending the ball over
the left field fence for a home run.
Hits were plentiful, the fielding of bril
liant hue and the excitement over the re
sult after the eventful ninth always at
cutting edge. The crowd shouted its lungs
sore and from the ninth till Umpire Mc-
Donald called quits was on Its feet.
To Pabst belongs the honor of saving
the game for Frisco. Once more he dem
onstrated hla right to the title of "surest
hitter in the league." The ninth opened
with a base on balls for Rube Levy. Then
came a two-bagger by, Krug to. left field
and Levy scored. The score now read 7 to
4. A single by Reilly was injected into
the game before Iburg struck out. Then
Brockhoff hit safely. Krug scoring. The
next play, a hit by Hlldebrand to Deve
reaux. which forced Reilly out at third,
placed Brockhoff and Hildebrand on the
bags, which were soon after filled by
Schwartz's hit. At this stage of the game,
two men out and the bags tilled, the P'ay
ers were as nervous as the crowd. Two
more runs meant a tie and Hughes looked
nervous as Pabst faced him. A hard
drive over the first bag to right field did
the trick, Brockhoff and Hlldebrand scor
ing and thus evening up the score. Sulli
van flew out and the inning was over.
From that time on the game was of the
one, two, three order, both sloes being re
tired in rapid fashion. The western sun,
full in the face of the batters, made it
difficult for them to see the ball, but they
played on in grim determination. Iburg
had pitched one ball la the thirteenth in
ning, when the game was called on ac
count of darkness.
To enumerate the plays, phenomenal
and startling, would be filling a book.
Krug in the field and McLaughlin and
Eagan with the bat were the stars. The
score:
Not in many years, perhaps never be
fore in the history of California baseball,
has such a sensational game been played
as that of yesterday between Sacramento
and San Francisco on' the Recreation dia
mond. Twelve innings were played, dark
ness putting an end to the drawn-out
struggle, with the score standing 7 to 7.

The hiird-runr.Snp hares proved quite a
factor in the run down of the open stake
yesterday, and outfooted their pursuers
in many events.
In the first part of the card the hounds
were outclassed in the matter of speed
and up to the seventeenth course suc
ceeded in scoring but two kills, the other
Jacks heating to the cpcape.
In the courso; between Solid Silver and
Bluest the hure ran the does all over the
field, leading khora a full 1CKÂ» yard* and
making an easy gH-away. Then with
Erin's Elope an<l Biack Da;?y, on account

Stake.
Bohe Shows Speed and Is Fav
ored by Talent to Reach
Good coursing was the result of the
run-down of theWnety-six dog open stake
at Union Park yesterday and judging
from the past records of the hounds that
remain on the card to-day's finals should
furnish Interesting sport.
J. H. Perigo's fast Eohe beat Deckel
man's Ben Kirby pointless in a course in
the early part of the stake in which fehe
showed much speed. The little bjack Uyer
is in good condition and barring accidents
has a good chance for stake honors. Tho
Pasha Kennels' Gold Nufrget and Fiery

manifested in their work.
A dozen short ends landed during the
duy at average .good odds, the best of
which v.-ere Scotland Yet against Erin at
5 to 1, Belle Clalr against Forget at 4 to 1,
both close races; Lady Granard against
Beauty Spot at 5 to 1 in a long course.
Lady Gtraldine against Whisky Hill at
3 to 1 and Hollo Kocktt, a young grey
hound, against Hot Haste at 5 to 1 in a
heavy scoring go. Twin City Girl beat
Hartford Lbfs pointless, and considering
her recent good performances is favored
to make a showing well down in the finals.
Cruiser, who is rated as a dangerous
opponent when tagalnst a hot favorite,
added another victory to his list of short
end v.'ins, beating Vanity Fair of the
Curtis kennel at 5 to 3. Golden- Russet

GRASS VALLEY, Oct. 6.â Rockets, red

out the entire population to-night to hear
Governor Gage speak on the issues of the
day. The train bearing the Governor was
waited for impatiently by several hun
dred people, and as It pulled Into the sta

get through the crowd. After holding an

At 7 p. m. the parade, with several hun

Through the efforts of Congressman
Loud; assisted by Postmaster Montague
of this city, the people of San Francisco
will be the first to enjoy the benefit of a
novel andvaluable invention of paniel S.
Richardson, superintendent of the San
Francisco Postofflce, whereby . a certain
check is placed upon negligent collectors
and the depositor of mail matter is en
abled to know at the time he places the
mail in the box the exact hour and min
ute that it will be taken out and the exact
time it will reach the station at the ferry.
Tho work of taking out the old boxes
and putting in the new ones will be begun
in this city to-morrow morning, and after
the 800 new letter boxes shall have been
installed the new device will be put in at
Chicago and Philadelphia, it being the in
tention of the Postofflce Department to
place them in every city In the Union
where letter boxes arp used in the streets.
The outer shell of the indicator, as the
new invention is known, is a casting
which takes the shape and dimensions of
the front of the box to which It Is at
tached. In front it has a glass-covered
slot one by six inches. The time an
nouncements are seen through this slot.
When the letter collector opens the box
to take out the mail matter the indicator
automatically changes the notice in the
glass-covered slot so that it gives the
time for the next visit of the collector.

space of thirty minutes. During the sus

tional Commltteeman, and J. C. Sims,
chairman of the Democratic State Com
mittee, went to Ihe Palace Hotel and
raid a visit of courtesy to Colonel George
Stone, chairman of the Republican State
Committee. Under the flag of truce var
ious topics were discussed, the climate of
California being the subject of elaborate
consideration. If the Democratic guests
expected a generous flow of champagne
thry must have been disappointed. The
Republican campaign, although earnest
and enthusiastic, is not pustalned with
sufficient mon;y to justity a departure
from beer as a beverage. There is said
to be some doubt whether the Democratic
campaign exchequer will afford ever the
luxury of a steam.

LEGISLATION FOR
THE UNDERTAKERS
OAKLAND, Oct. 6.â A marriage license
was issued late this afternoon to Andrew
D. Pryal and Ruth Ellen Crane. Pryal
is one of Alameda County's first settlers
and is State Horticultural Commissioner
for this district. He is 65 years of age,
while his prospective bride confesses to
but 34.
Mr. Pryal has a family of grown chil
dren, none of whom had heard of their
father's matrimonial intentions until this
evening. Miss E. Pryal was startled to
learn that her father had determined upon
a second embarkation In the matrimonial
seas.
"Father left the house about 9 o'clock
this morning," she said. "He complained
of not being well and said he might not
return until evening. I know the woman
he secured the license to marry. She Is
Mrs. Ruth Crane. All she wants is â¢my
father's property. She is an unprinci
pled woman and has been designing for
some time to get father In her clutches.
This woman has been the cause of all the
trouble that has disturbed our family
since the death of my mother two years
ago. -
"I do not know whether my father will
bring his wife to the old home to live or
not. If he attempts to do so there will be
a strong protest from me and my brothers
and sisters."
â¢ Since the death of Andrew Pryal's first
wife about two years ago the family has
been in a state of almost constant tur
moil. Battery charges have been settled
in the minor courts and higher tribunals
have been called upon to adjudicate law
suits over 'valuable land. Brother has
been arrayed against brother and father
against son.
The principal fight was over the posses
sion of the beautiful old homestead at
Claremont. "William A. Pryal, the eldest
son, claimed to hold deeds to the property
from his mother, but his father contested
his alleged title and was awarded the old
homestead.
For a time the two sons, "William A. and
Charles 'D.. took' opposite sides on mat
ters of minor importance and their differ
ences culminated in a row in which stove
lids and pieces of cordwood were used.
The warring brothers each had the other
arrested, and Justice Qulnn, as mediator,
fined them heavily.
The new turn of affairsâ the bringing of
a young stepmother on the scene â adds
new complications and further litigation
will probably cause the aged pioneer and
his young bride many anxious hours.

was a clash between the Board of Health

portions of the membrane of the throat
of the deceased to have them examined

Dr. Stevens reported that the disease

there and conquer them. We bought a full
rrown war for J2O.00O.00O and have spent J200.-
COO.OOO more and have a bigger war now than
we bought.
The man who takes our flag and makes of It
the- emblem of enforced government, of tho
divine right of the ruler, has already pulled it
down.
If there ever was a time when a people
fought for a cause that was Just, this is th<Â»
time and this is the people. With a cause that
Is Just, with a leader of whom we are proud,
there are not Mark Hannas enough this side of
the realms of his Satanic majesty to stop our
triumphant march to victory.
You say we must conquer them because we
bought them. There can be no sale without a
delivery. Spain sold us only the right to go
Filipinos for their own good. There never was
a tyrant who robbed an Innocent people but
who did It for their own good. We can give to
China a -better government than it has, so we
must conauer China also, must we?
It is said we must conquer the Philippines to
build up a commerce. Let me tell you. you
have already spent more trying to conquer
them than you can make out of their com
merce In a century- Besides, I would not give
the life of one proud son of an American
You say the world Is moving: we must con
front new conditions. Yes, my Republican
friends, but "have you forgotten that the fires
of liberty burn brightly on the hearths of the
American people. You 'say we must rule the
You want to increase the t>tanding army. We
have spent eighteen years of our short national
life In warfare. Let us cut down our army
bill and pave our earnings for the school house,
the library and tHt home.
Our fathers taught us that government de
rives Its Just power from the consent of the
governed. The administration says It derives
Its power from the conrent of the governor. It
has established taxation without representa
tion. The soldiers of the United States are to
night encamped on five foreign lands.
My Republican friends say this Is not impe
rialism, it Is expansion. Do you desire to
make States out of the Philippine Islands? Do
you intend to make its people citizens? They
must be citizens or subjects; which do you
Intend to make of them?
An issue is a paramount one. not because a
jlatfoini calls It go. but because events make
It paramount: because the destiny of the coun
try is bound up with It.- If I stood alone with
the destiny of my country in my hand, what
above all else should I do for Its welfare? The
Declaration of Independence is the substratum
on which the constitution rests. Shall we now
abandon its principles and Join hands with
dcciK>ts like that from which we severed our
selves a century and a quarter ago?
Imperialism as it confronts us Is a simple
thins. Government by force, enforced citizen
ship Is a primal factor.' The policy this coun
try is asked to adopt Is to reach out 8000 miles
beyond the outermost rim of our old territory,
to extend our domain down Into a country
where men of our own race may not go; to
make that people subjects and vassals of the
United States. That Is Imperialism If there
is such a thins as imperialism in the politics
of the world.
A number of campaign pictures were
thrown. on a screen during an Intermis
sion and then Jud R. Rush was Intro
duced. He spoke in part as follows:
Ladles and Gentlemen: I have a message to
deliver from the people of the sunny southland.
On election day we Intend to give you a sur
prise. We fully expect that In that land of
oranges, one-lungers and Republicans we will
eliminate a larger part of the latter.
The people of this country are confronted
with a new political issue. It is not a new
question. There have ever been those who at
tempted to rule over their fellows; there have
ever been those who held that government Is by
the people and for the people.
When must we call home our armies? When
must this stream of wealth cease? What right
have we in the Philippines? My Republican
friend says, "We have become a world power."
1 grant you we are strong enough to wipe out
the Philippines. But. I ask you. what right
have we to be there? There never yet was
a nation strong enough to dare to be wrong,
and we do not dare to be wrong.
You have reached the parting of the ways.
Under which flag will you serve, Bryan's or
Mark Hannahs?
For more than two centuries the people of the
Philippines had struggled intermittently to
throw off the yoke of Spain. Whether or not
Wfl became legally the allies of the Insurgents
wÂ» were morally so. Every shot fired bjr a
Filipino was fired at an enemy of the United
States and In Its behalf. When the United
States had conquered Spain It had the right
to demand Indemnity for the lives of" soldiers
killed in battle. Did our great Republican ad
ministration do so? No. it paid J2O.0OO.00O for
Spain's lost territories. You heard no more
then of criminal agprresslon. You heard no
more of governments deriving their Just powers
from the consent of the governed.
My brother, deny liberty to the Filipinos and
just as certain as Abraham Lincoln spoke the
truth, you will deserve It not for yourselves.
After a song by the Columbia Quartet
and an encore the chairman introduced
John J. Barrett, who spoke in part aa
follows:
Are we to leave our glorious destiny for
that Dointed out by Hanna? I think there la
enough manhood left in America to oveftom*
tho tendencies to Imperialism and elect Wil
liam J. Bryan, the apostle of equal rights.
We are told by Mr. Hanna that thÂ« only Is
sue of the campaign Is whether the worktnK
men 'shall have a full dinner pail, and we are
laughed at because we eay there is a higher
question before American laborers. Either our
revolutionary sires were wrong or else the Mc-
Xlr.ley administration and Mr. Mark Hanna
are wrong to-day. Those sires of whom we are
so proud refused to submit to taxation with
out representation for sake of the principle in
volved. Shall we become the embodiment of
that principle that we fought against then?

in the assembly hall of the Odd Fellows'
building, was witnessed by a large num
ber of people, Including the members of
Canton No. 5, Patriarchs' Militant, Cap
tain Kornbeck, and several military men.
These last described, who are experts' in
drilling, declare that the execution of the
movements in marching by the young
ladies was as perfect as any body of hu
man beings can do anything when Â«cting
In unison. There was no hesitancy when
an order was given, but It was executed
with promptitude and precision. If the
ladies of the corps do as well at Redding
during the competition with other corps
as they did on the occasion of the exhi
bition drill they stand an excellent chance
of carrying away the trophy offered. Gen

previously noticed. There was an attend

Fellows' building to its limit. The pro
gramme included the following numbers:
J. E. Spink and sister, instrumental duet;
Arthur Mcrrifleld, piano selections; Miss

Fleming, soprano solo; Miss Alma Warn
holz. piano recital; Horace White, bary
tone solo; K. J. Walles, whistlinc solo;
William O'lirien, tenor solo, and G.

sented was loudly applauded not because
it is the rule to do so but because each
deserved the applause so heartily be
stowed. This was particularly for the
piano and violin duet by Mr. and Miss
Spink. The open meetings of this lodge
are the talk of the order and friends, and
the demand for invitations increases
monthly. A dance followed the pro
gramme, and during the evening the mem

from the crowd and went to the lower
banquet hall, where they enjoyed a colla
tion before the dance.

NEW YORK. Oct. 6.â Attention centered on
the ba.sk statement on the Stock Exchange
to-day. But tLe very h^avy decline In the
c&Â§h reserve of the banks s<?cmed to have little
tfTect on epeculatlve sentiment, beyond a flut
ter among the emaller class of traders who
offered prices down after the statement ap
peared. The larger speculators who have been
bucking the market during the week seemed
content to etand by and watch the effect of
the statement on general speculative sentiment.
The steadiness of the market under the show-
Ing by the banks seems surprising, when lt is
duly considered that great stress has been laid
by the sjxiculators for the rise on the offsets
to the Interior drain of currency which were
expected to mitigate the cash loss. Even yes
terday when the movement to the Interior was
Known to be large, the maximum estimate of
the decline in cash did not reach J6.000.000. The
large payment of Pacific gold draft* last week
v â.- expected to moderate that showing under
the system of computations by dally averages.
but instead of that the ios* of thÂ« cash for the
â¢week was run ap to tS,C74,750, and the remain
ing surplus of tha bar.ks is cut In half. The
Interior demand for cash has been larger than
any previous week of the reason and far in
excess of any tingle wwk in the fall season of
last year. The extraordinary cotton movement
Is undoubtedly responsible for the showing.
The tquanimity of speculators In face of the
bank statement mutt be due to the conviction
that the heavy movement of cotton to the sea
board Insures a continuance of the export
movement.
This week's further advance In the prices of
etocks cannot be attributed to a demand from
the ehort interest in the same degr<Â»Â« as that
of last week. There has been some covering
of Ehort contracts on the rise and the profes
sional operators, who have the advance in
hand, evidently booe to dislodge the long
Standing ehort Interest which has persisted in
the etock market on the theory that the busi
ness reaction will continue and warrant further
ehrinkasre of prices. The bull party is evi
dently playing, a'.so, to attract an outside buy-
Ing movement of the class which nothing but
m. rapid advance in prices brings into the stock
market. The effort ha* not proved sufficient
to absorb the profit-taking by professionals,
who sought to reduce their commitments at a
moderate advance. The favorable Increase In
cidents of the *Â«k have been made most of
by the bulls, but the loudest protestations are
of in the ultimate outcome of con
ditions over which the public at large is still
evidently in doubt, officially a revival of
bastXMM to last year'Â« high level of prosperity.
Tbo manipulative character of the market was
f\l<lfM from the number of assertions put in
circulation on the Stock Exchange which failed
of verification. A vosltive announcement that
the coal strike had lx-en called off served Its
purpose in ruahinp price** up late one day, and
there v.-ere various rumors of absorptions and
consolidations of railroad systems, while bro
kers vigorously bid up the stocks concerned
with a :ia!ual'Ie disinclination to avail thrm
lv!\-eK of li.v.er ;>r:ct-Â« to absorb the stocks. But
It was notable that the advances thus secured
did not bring out any heavy offerings from
othrr than epeculatlve holders and price re
artiors were not severe, even when the un
renciou character at the reports was rec
ormized. This unirrtonw of firmness crave con
fidence to the bull following. The hopeful
views fxrrftff<i by authorities In the Iron and
et<-Â« 1 trade had a marked Influence on the much
depressed Ftooks in that group and affected the
frer.era.1 lift favorably in sympathy. The de
claration of the regular quarterly dividend of
2 w>r <er.i in Tenrie*s~e Coal ended a very
bold bear campaign against the Etock, based
on roritive assertions widely published, that
the dividend would be reduced or passed. The
fuhwKju?nt rebound in the stock had a. ret'lvl
ryir.fr influence on all the stocks in trie eteel
rroun. The placing of some large orders for
freiejit ears, was another element In the
rtrÂ«-nÂ»rth of the croup. From the technical
fide, the completion of ecme recent order* for
liquidation of various stocks was a relief to the
markrt and facilitated the advance. I3ut the
point probably mort relied upon by the bulls
m the promise of early Imports of gold, and
the apriar< nt arquiescpnee of European money
markets pf refraining from advancing their
<51*Tu;rit rates. Cl
Therf !.aÂ« boÂ«-n only a slight Increase In bond

NEW YORK. Oct. 6.-The Financier .ays:

for the almoft stationary lean column. While
ir.ere is nothing to warrant the assertion It
appears as though there had been a period of
active borrowing during the week not pre
viously known. At any rate the general tend
ency or the banks just now Is to contract loans
arid the small decrease for the wpek compares
oddly w:th the decreases of the two weeks' re- '
serves. The dwindling reserve does not mean ,
a stringency in the market. It emphasizes the
ract that money is going to remain firm over !
election. The rise in rates will lead to re
newed talk of gold imports, but nobody regards
the occasion serious enough to call for ship
ments of^ specie -to this side, although If a|
small profit can be shown the current may !
turn this way again. The most curious phase
of the situation is what would have happened
had It not been for the greatly enlarged vol
ume of national bank currency within the
year.

Captain. William L.. Wall of Company
M, First Infantry, has not yet received
from the office of the adjutant general
at Sacramento his commission as first
lieutenant, which he ought to have re
ceived In the early part of the year nor his
commission as captain, which ought to
have been, issued soon after he was elect
ed to that position last April. The men of
his company are wondering if the same
tactics are being carried on as in the lat
ter part of 1899, when Wall was commis
sioned first lieutenant in the First Cali
fornia Volunteers. At that time the com
mission was duly signed and sent to this
city, but It was 'not delivered and some
time after was found by a bellboy in an
ash barnel at the Occidental Hotel. The
finder turned it over to Major O'Neil
and finally it got Into the hands of Wall
The men who elected Wall first as first
lieutenant of the company and subse
quently honored him by electing him their
captain are thinking of obtaining search
warrants to permit them looking Into a
number of ash barrels with the idea that
they might find the missing commission
there. A feature of the delay is that it
will deprive the captain of his vote when
it comes to voting for colonel of the First
Infantry and it Is thought by some that
the commission is held back, if it is not in
an ash barrel, to punish one of the can
didates for the colonelcy, who in October
was charged with having been instru
mental in having the finding of the com
mission in the ash barrel made public
through The Call, although the candldatÂ»
has satisfactorily proved that he was not
the one "who pave It away."
An effort will be made In the near future
to call together the officers of all the
organizations in the Second Brigade for
the purpose of discussing a number of
changes which it Is thought would be for
the best Interest of the guard, not only of
the brigade, but of the entire State. One
of these will be a movement looking to
ward the taking of the guord out of poli
tics and the appointment of officials upon
their merits and records as military men
and not upon their political pulls. Another
matter tfiat will be discussed will be a
proposed changa In the present system of
electing officers of companies. It will be
suggested that captains and lieutenants
be appointed during good behavior and to
remain in position until either promoted
or retired for age. as In the regular army
It is claimed that under the present sys
