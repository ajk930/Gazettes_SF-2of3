CONSTANTINOPLE. Nov. 23.â The

tucky, which arrived here November 13,
sails to-morrow for Smyrna.
The Turkish objection to the establish
ment of a" consulate at harpoot acd Er
zeroum. under this apparently clear per
mission, has been based on the rather
novel reason that there was no com
merce at these two points, ar.d it has
be*n rather difflcult for our officials to
establish the contrary proposition. But
some time ago the Turkish Government
accorded to the British Government the
right to establish a consulate at Harpoot
and the State Department Immediately
based an additional claim on the "favored
nation" clause of its general treaty, which
would appear to warrant It In demanding
the same privilege of establishing a con
sulate at a given pclnt in Turkey as was
granted to Great Britain.
The State Department holds that Har
poot Is an important commercial point,
and the Interests cf the United States re
<;ulre the presence cf a Consul. An In
struction to Mr. Griscom to repeat the de
rr&nd has been forwarded, but the refusal
cf the Sublime Porte to Issue the exequa

CALL BUREAU. WELLINGTON HO
TEL. WASHINGTON. Nov. 23.â President
MeKinley will have the preliminary re
port cf the Isthmian Canal Commusion In
his hands within two or three day*. It
is now complete and its various parts are
being assembled. It favors the construc
tion of the canal across Nicaragua as
against all other routes proposed: favor3
the construction of a canal thirty feet in
depth at a cost of about IL20.MO.000; dls
courages the building of a thirty-flv,* foot
canal at present, although estimates for
a canal of such depth hav--Â» been made.
A thirty-five-foot canal would cost abont
J173.COO.C0O. The report recommends, hew
ever, that the locks and cams of the
thirty-foot canal be so constructed as to
permit the canal to be deepened five feet
when commerce requires It. and prac
tically eliminates from consideration the
Panama canal, which route has been the
only real competitor of the Nicirasrua.
waterway. This is owing to the appar-at
inability of Director General Hutin to
make a proposition to sell to the United
States.; s
The present canal commission was ap
pointed to examine all the rossible canal
routes to-be found on the Isthmus. At
an early stage of the investigation it was
ascertained that only two routes -xera
practicable. Nicaragua and Panama, the
next best being the Darien canal, which
crossed the divide 600 feet above the J.ta
level, requiring a tunnel 200 feet in height.
It Is found tfcat there are no englneer'ng
or physical impossibilities on either the
Nicaragua or Panama route. The matte
cf ccst Is largely In favor of Nicaragua
as the estimate for the completion of the
Panama canal as it stands fs about Jl*).
00O.C0O. Th5s does not take Into accnunc
such money as would have to ba paid
for ' Improvements already made on the
Panama isthmus. Serious consideration
of the Panama project has been impos
sible owing to the refusal of .Its ow-iera
to set a price at which It coulo be bcÂ»yht.
The Panama company was asked two
questions, the first being: "Can you sell
outright to the United States?" an-i "How
much will you sell for?"
Representatives of the Panama com
pany in conference with the commUston-
ers to-day have continued to evad? these
questions and the American engineers
have reached the conclusion. Ion? ago
foreshadowed, that the Panama men have
no Intention of selling to the American
Government, the opposition to th<i Nica
ragua canal being based on a desire to
nullify that project so that they can float
another French lean to complete the work
themselves. William Nelson Cromwell of
New Tork Is here as attorney for the
company.
The route adopted across Nicaragua by
the present - commission follows closely
that recemmended by the Walker com
mission two years ago." The total distance
from the Pacific to the Atlantic is 190
miles. Commencing at Brito. on the Pa
cific Coast, and following up the east side
of the Bio Grande a vessel would, by aid
of four Iock3, reach the summit and level
of Lake Nicaragua, which is 116 feet above
the Pacific Ocean. The distance from
Brito to the lake is 17.S miles. The ra^qi
line then crosses the lake, a distance of
about seventy-one miles, to the heaJ of
the San Juan River.
Following this river for fifty-seven miles
the site of the proposed dam is reached
at Boca San Carlos. Here the canal leaves
the river bed. but follows j the valley for
twenty -one miles to a point opposite the
mouth of the Rio SaripiquL From this
point a. nearly straight line Is mad* o th-
Atlantic Ocean at Greytown. twenty-two
miles more.
To build this canal a depth of thirty
feet, as recommended by the commission.
It will be necessary to remove about 1S0,-
COO.00O cubic yards of earth and rock. A
great engineering feature of the enter
price is the proposed dam at San Carlos,
which will be US feet high from its rock
bed to the crest, and the crest will be
nearly 13C0 feet in length. The building
of a dam at point avoids questions
which arose under previous survey* from
possible flood waters of *he river San
Carlos, which in the proposed plan enters
the San Juan below Instead of above the
dam.
The full report, of the commission.
which will be rendered some time thi3
winter, win contain many papers of great
Interest and value upon climate, trade
influences, effect upon population and
other economic questions arising in con
sideration of the canal.
The work of the present commission has
been moat thorough. Every possible va
riant has been surveyed and hundreds of
sites for dams and Iock3 were 'considered

CALL BUREAU. WELLINGTON HO
TEL. WASHINGTON, Nov. 23.âAssur
ances of a particularly gratifying and
important charac^r. declaring their pur
pcrse to act conjointly and In harmony
to effect a prompt settlement of the Chi
nese 'uestlon, were to-day given the
United States by Russia. Germany,
Great Britain. France and Japan. These
declaration* of tbe powers are due to
the diplomacy of the President and Sec
retary Hay. Development? In Peking
had showed conclusively that none of the
Ministers were alive to the Importance of
formulating demands with which the Chi
nese Government could comply. Proposi
tions were being made, especially by rep
resentatives of the powers whose policies
were regarded wltn suspicion, the adop
tion of which could only result In rejec
tion by the Chinese Government and the
resumption of hostilities. . It was there
fore decided .hat in the Interest of a
prompt settlement It was desirable to ap
peal to the powers direct.
An Identical note was. therefore, ad
dressed to the Interested Voyernments In
...ura&e,. ?-=d Japan.'an.V"''.:;.*'correspond
ence- which followed culminated In . the
aseuran - referred to. These assurance*
repeat the declarations which were made
in connection with the indorsement of the
Anglo-German agreement, and would
seem on their face to show that thÂ« pow
ers are actuated by the single purpose
of ending the present unsatisfactory
conditions In the Celestial Empire. Yet
the fact remains that at least two pow
ers have been pursuing in a" eking the
most obstructive tactics, and have evi
dently favored a policy designed to pro
voke the Chinese to armed resistance.
An important point about these latest
declarations is that the powers expressly
state that they desire such solutions of
the Chinese troubles as can be adopted
b" the imperial government without dan
ger to Its safety. Mr. Conger is directed
to urge -on his colleagues the necessity
of agreeing uoon demands which will be
reasonably certain of acceptance by ue
Chinese. The President and Secretary
Hay appreciate the weakness of the Im
perial government, and do not want the
shadow of imperial authority to disap
pear as a result cf th' machinations of
rowerful -"nces and officials. Even de
spite the assurances of the powers that
they desire a prompt settlement and are
willing to work harmoniously to secure
It. the authorities here apparently expect
disagreement. In anticipation of the fail
ure of negotiations and des^ing that ef
forts to reach a Joint agreement shall
continue, the officials are casting auout
for a method of solution that will satisfy
all. This subject has been given care
ful consideration by the President" and
Cabinet, who at to-day's session discussed
the whole Chinese solution. The sugges
tion for settlement of the question by an
international conference, participated In
by the representatives of the powers, to
be held in a European capital, has been
revived, but among conservative oSdals
It is believed that an even better plan
would be the adoption of a policy refer
ring the matter to the Hague Court of
Arbitration. The main aim of the Presi
dent Is to obtain a settlement that will
Insure the territorial and administrative
entity of China.
The story that the President contem
plates acquiring Chinese territory is posi
tively denied by the State Department.
This authoritative statement was made
to-day: "There is no foundation what
ever for the report that the United
States purposes to acquire Chinese terri
tory. This Is contrary to the declared
policy of the President- Every effcrt !s
being made to preserve the territorial in
tegrity of the empire, and to this end the
President is endeavoring to bring about a
prompt settlement." _

were heavily charged and ear-splitting
detonations accompanied him as he slow
ly proceeded to the hotel. Illuminations
and salvos heightened the excitement of
the huge concourse which crouched upon
the roadway, barely leaving a passage.
Finally the carriage reached the hotel,
which faces on a spacious square. Mount
ed gendarmes kept a space open across
the square and escorted the landau. Mr.
Kruper. who was bareheaded, bowed to
the right and left as re rode along.
His apartment, which is on the first floor
and has a balcony, draped with Boer and
French flags, overlooks the square and
the specataclfi from the balcony was such
as Mr. Kruger had never witnessed be
fore. Below him was an ocean of faces,
illuminated by a dazzling electric light.
Enthusiasm was at white heat. An un
ceasing roar of cheering arose from the
throats of the multitude, which numbered
many thousands. A veritable forest of
hats, canes, hands and handkerchiefs was
agitated until Mr. Kruger came to tho
front of the balcony and acknowledged
repeatedly the hurricane of plaudits. He
uttered a few words of thanks, which
wtre Interpreted and shouted down to the
people.
Mr. Kruger then retired from the bal
cony and received the Mayor, members
of the city Council and various delega
tions presenting addresses and bouquets.
Tlie City Council had made great prepara
tions to entertain him and offered punch
in his honor in the biggest hall of the
town. He excused himself from aWend-
Jng the function, but Dr. Leyds and the
other Boer delegates represented him. . 'Â¦.
The crowd In the streets was decidedly
hostile to England, raising anti-British
cries. A procession of students paraded,
chanting monotonously denunciations of
everything English. The enthusiasm last
ed until a late hour.
To-morrow morning at 6:25 Mr. Kruger
will start for Paris.
Dr. Leyds says he has been informed
that M. Crozier will greet Mr. Kruger at
the Gare de Lion, Paris, in the name of
President Loubet.
Before leaving Marseilles Mr. Kruger
spoke briefly as follows:
the stores will be closed for the rest of the
afternoon. There is certain to be an Im
mense concourse of people along the en
tire route. ;. >Â»: k ;Â»..:.; ~^vi>
BTJRGHERS LOSE MANY MEN.
General De Wet Regales His Follow-
ers With Fairy Tales.
LONDON, Nov. 23.â A special dispatch
from Mlddleborg, Transvaal Colony, says
that in the- surprise of the outpost of the
â¢'Buffs" (Third Infantry), southwest of
Balmoral, on November 10, the Boer? lost
sixty men killed and wounded. The burgh
ers, the dispatch adds, simultaneously at
tacked a garrison of Fusiliers on Wilge
River, but were beaten off with the loss
of 130 men killed and wounded. â¢
The Standard to-day, commenting on the
report that General Botha, with his com
mando, is close to Dewetsdorp, regards
the news as most disquieting and says:
"\\ e have heard many strange and un
veriflable stories, but one thing we know
that French was pursued all the way
from Middleborg to Standerton and got
through the terrible neck of the moun
tains only by the skin of his teeth."
The Star suggests that General Botha
pursued the British, marched south and
joined hands with General De Wet, and
thus Bloemfontein is endangered and the
Orange Free State will Â» have to be re
conquered before the subduing of the
Transvaal can be commenced.
In connection with the foregoing a be
lated telegram to-day announces that Gen
eral French arrived at Johannesburg on
November 17. -.
KRQONSPRUIT, Orange River Colony,
Nov. 23.â General Bruce-Hamilton's col

inR the Llndley and Heilbron districts.
The troops brought in a number of pris
oners. The latter relate the assurances
they received at Thaban Ciiu'from Gen
eral De Wet a fortnight ago. De Wet,
they say. urged the burghers to hold out
until December 10. when "all the British
were going home." He added that, the
British hart the permission of Russia to
fight for a year only; that Queen Victoria
was at Cape Town, whither she had fled
trÂ» escape the Chinese, who had captured
half of England: that General Botha had
driven the British out of the v Transvaal
and had taken Pletermarltzburg; that De
Wet himself was fighting In Cape Colony,
burning farms, and that Lord Roberts,
wounded by three bullets, had been taken
to Heilbron to die and had been burled
there beneath the Town Hall.

BERLIN, Nov. 23.â In the Reichstag to
day, replying to a question regarding the
expulsion of Germans from the Transvaal,
Baron von Rlchthofen, Secretary for For
eign/ Affairs, declared international law
justified the British authorities in remov
ing from the seat of war undesirable per
sons. But Germany, he added, had ener
getically intervened In favor of those ex

necessary harshness. Germany had also
formulated demands for compensation and
Great Britain had replied that she was
prepared to compensate those who Had
been unjustifiably expelled.

BROKER MAKES
AN ASSIGNMENT
Chester B. Lawrence Jr. Is
Financially Em
barrassed.
v Â«
Customers ; Chiefly Women, Many of
Whom Faint When Announce
ment of the Assignment
Is Made.
Â¦ ? .
NEW YORK, Nov. 23.â Chester B. Law
rence Jr.. a member of the Consolidated
Stock Exchange, made an assignment to
day to George H.'Wolbert.
Among Lawrence's customers were
many women, and a number of them be
came hysterical in his office when the
assignment was announced. Lawrence,
who had five offices in this city, is said
to have been in difficulties for several
weeks, and his troubles were brought to
a head by a customer who has had Law
rence and Edward B. Underhlll, his office
manager, summoned to court on the ac
cusation of withholding her money and
bonds and refusing to give her an im
mediate statement.
The assignee said he knew nothing of
the assets or liabilities, and said he
would make no statement until after an
examination of the books had been mane.
Lawrence has done a large business for
several years. Several brokers were em
ployed to execute his orders on the Con
solidated Exchange. Edward Underhill,
who was known as the office manager, is
said to have been Lawrence's financial
backer. He organized branch offices in
different parts of the city and directed
the advertising, which was so extensive
that orders were received from every part
of the country. It is believed the liabili
ties will exceed $200,000.
Late this . afternoon fLawrence, with
"Wolbert, the assignee, and Edward B.
Underhill, manager of the business house,
were arrested by central ofllce detectives
and locked up In police headquarters.
They are charged with grand larceny on
tho specific complaint of Mrs. Catherine
Rouckendorf. .She claims that the stock,
broker has three $1000 bonds belonging to
her.
Lawrence became a member of the Con
solidated Exchange in March. 1899. He
is said to have done a very large busi
ness. Edward B. Underhill was the ac
tive manager of the concern, according to
the statement of the customers. Under
bill is paid to have extensive property In
this city and to be worth in his own right
probably a million dollars.

"Farmers in the East frequently have
their crops ruined or partially so, by lack
of sufficient water, due to a lack of fore
thought and expenditures, which will re
sult in full crops.
"Throughout the entire East, as in the
States bordering on the Atlantic, the
question of irrigation is a practical one,
worthy of study, and its proper solution
will mean much to the people in the util
ization of their natural resources. Facil
ities should be provided by the States or
by the Government, for a further study
of the problems involved in the practical
working out of a system."
The following was sent to President Mc-
Kinley: Â»
"The ninth session of the National Irri
gation Congress, now in session in Chl
j cago, respectfully urges that in your mes
sage to Congress you call attention to the
national importance of tho preservation
j of our forests and of the extension and
i conservative use of the forest reserves;
! and further, that we emphasize the need
of national action to store the flood
waters that now go to waste."

Secretary Wilson's letter was in part as
follows:
The water problem, like the forest problem.
Is essentially and primarily one of conservation
and use. The waste of water In floods and the
waste of forests by flre are paral
lel losses. each utterly hostile to thÂ»

the nation at â¢ large, and each prpvent
able by perfe#ly well-known means. Enlight
ened public opinion ana the use of expert skill

we are to save the forests and store the floods.
In accordance with the admirable motto of
your Congress. The creation of public senti

which confront the Irrlgator and to make the
forests of the great West and of the East as
well yield their products year after year and
decade after decade in unbroken abundance.
The vast developments which you are plan
ning can become permanent only by the Junc
tion of wise conservatism with energy, and the
natural resources, which have cost you nothing,
must be protected and husbanded with the
Fame trained car* which you are making ready
to bestow upon vast systems of artificial works
for irrigation. The chief dangers which
threaten your plans â one, the failure to secure
the building of these great works: the other,
the failure . to protect the : forests from which
your waters comeâ are best met. like - m<**t

PAUL KRUGER
NOW THE IDOL
OF THE FRENCH
Is Enthusiastically
Greeted at Every
Station.
ANTI-ENGLISH CRIES
Former President of Trans
vaal Thanks Admirers
and Talks in Hope
ful Strain.
DIJON. France. Now 23.â Mr. Kruger
has become for the moment at least the
popular idol of the French. His triumph
am progress northward through the coun
try from Marseilles to Dijon has placed
this beyond doubt. He met with a tre
mendous reception in each town along the
route where the train stopped, culminat
ing in scenes of frenzied enthusiasm here
thif evening calculated to turn the head
ot anj man. .
The population of Marseilles gathered
In thousands this morning to escort him tj
the rA'Jroad station and gave him a rous
ing <end-<:fl. while at Tarasotm. Avignon,
Valencia. Lyons, Macol and Dijon the in
habitants who crowded the railroad sta
tions made the rafters tremble with en
thusiastic shouts ot "Vive Kruger 1 ' and
"Vive log Boers."
The demonstration was all the more
significant because it shows the fervid ac
clamations at Marseilles were not merely
an explosion of exuberance on the part of
the warm-hfartcd and excitable populac
of a Finny clime, but sentiments shared
with even great* r intensity by the usualiy
lefs demonstrative and colder bloodeJ in
habitants of the northern provinces.
The warmth of th-e enthusiasm Increased
instead of decreased as might have rea
sonably been expected from the difference
in character of the inhabitants in prov
inces through which Mr. Kruger passed,
but one of the most important phases of
the demonstration was the turn it took
in an anti-British direction. The few
criminally foolish Englishmen whose ill
timed levity at the Hotel Du Louvre in
.Marseilles exasperated the people in the
streets there never dreamed of the conse
quences of their act. They soweu the
wind and to-day the English people are
naping the whirlwind.
'1 ne news of the supposed insult to Mr.
Krugw f^eenis to have spread across
liance, and at nil stations, out especially
at Lyons and Dijon, shouts for the Buers
v ere mingled with lou<i cries of "Down
v ith the iJnglish:" indeed, at Lyons the
denunciations Â»i the Knglish drowned the
shouting for the Boers. This is the dis
turbing feature which is universally dis
cussed. Fears are expressed that to
morrow's reception in Paris may assume
a character calculated to arouse the leel
irig of Oreat Britajn against France to
fiich an extent as to result in unpleasant
relations between the two countries.
The warmth of enthusiasm reached in
Marseilles yesterday palpably raised the
f-j;irits of Mr. Kruger and his advisers to
a high pitch. The faces of Dr. Leyds. Mr.
I'ischer and others, which on the evt of
the arrival of Mr. Kruger revealed the
pnxiety which they felt regarding his re
< option, were to-day lighted up with hap
jiine^s and confidence. Evldentlv hops
had revived in all that his mission to
Kurope would be crowned with success,
Mr. Fischer spoke to Mr. Kruger to-day
regarding the visit of the Boer envoys to

wc-lcome they had received there from
the American people. He expressed hlm
reif grateful to know that so many Amer
icans had expressed sympathy with the
cause of the Transvaal, adding that he
was not surprised to learn this, as he had
expected all along that the freedom-loving
citizens of the American republic would
stand by the Boers in the struggle to de
fn;d the liberty which they had pre
viously won for themselves.
To-rlay Mr. Kroger waÂ« dressed in fa
mliiar attire, wearing the rosette o* the
l^cicn of Hcnor in a buttonhole of his
overcoat! As soon as jhe train left Mar
seilles, amid dfafenlng salvos, he took a
teat in the salmon in an arm chair amid
his friendr. where he pat for the most ol
the time silent, listening to the conversa
tion going on around him and puffing hi3

At Tarascon delegations awaiting the
Train's arrival on the platform presented
addresses and bouquets. He made his ap
pearance nt the window and bowed In re
tponse to the cheering. Similar scenes
took place at Avignon and Valencia,
Â¦where the platform in each case was black
â¢wish people. Numbers climbed upon the
rocf of the trains waiting at the station
and some clambered to the roof of Mr.
KrugÂ»r'p own car.
During the run through the rural dis
tricts the train passed groups of peasan
Try. who waved handkerchiefs and hats
find cheered. At one point women ha-1
climbed the trees, and clinging to the
branches with on" hand, they waved
handkerchiefs with the other. At several
points infantrymen and cm-a'.rymen en
foot drew up near the roadside, whirle 1
their hats around their head? and gave
Th<> military salute.
The most remarkable demonstration
alone the r<">ute occurred at Lyons station.
AÂ« the 'rain slowed down on entering the
town tr*Â«Â» wiirlnws and roofs of houses
Tvithin view were seen to be occupied by
perple. When it stepped in the wide, lofty
station, every inch was covered with h
concourse ct thousand*, who sent up
in'ghty shouts of "Long live Kruger,' 1 ami
'TViwn with the English.:* Again and
strain the rafters resounded with the plau
dits for the Bikers and the anti-English
Â«-HÂ«>s. It was a memorable scene.
The jxÂ»opiÂ»Â« swarmed on th* eteps and
r-Â»ofs of th* train, and even clambered on
Hie locomotive. Many clung to the gas
lames and here also a few climbed to the
roof of Mr. Kruger's car.
! Outside the station stood a still greater
assembly awaltfntr to witness the presen
tation of the address of the municipal
authorities in the square in front of the
station. Mr. Krugcr and his friends
alighted from the carriage and proceeded
through the station to the square, which
]<es high above the level of the town. The
r-Temony of presentation took place on a
jiarapet which looked down upon a sea of
upturned faces. A Frenchman* held a
tricolor beside Mr.- Kruger as he replied
to the address, which breathed sympathy
pnd admiration, and when he concluded
ihe cheers were renewed. He bowed and

many persons clinging to the footboard
rrf the carriage to shake Mr. Kruger's
hands.
As the train passed over the Rhone the
pap^Tijrers could see thousands massed
along the ri\ - er fide and on the suspension
bridge higher up the river. Their hoarse
â¢ heers came faintly to Mr. Kruger's ears,
hut the waving hats and handkerchiefs
r-nuld hp distinctly seen. He stood at the
Â¦window howfnsr until lost to view.
A noteworthy feature in the crowd at
Lvoris was the presence of .a number
of French officers in uniform, who Joined
heartily In the cheering. Their scarlet
cap?, with prtld embroidery, were conspic
uous. At other stations officer? ran as
eagerly as anyone from one end of the
<*ar to the other to catch a glimpse of
Mr. Kruger's features and to join in the
acclamations.
The Boer statesman and his friends
were much elated, but they had never
foreseen the still more elaborate enthusi
asm that was awaiting tbeir arrival at
rMJon. which they reached at 5:15 p. m.
The municipality had taken matters Into
it* own hands, not leaving the reception
to private committee*, a? at Marseille!!,
and the result was a demonstration 'such
as never before Had oeen -witnessed with
in the memory of the oldest inhabitants.

NEW YORK, Nov. 23.â Bishop Henry
'C. Potter to-day delivered an addre?3 on
"God and the City" Jn St. Paul's chapel.
in which he suggested the organization of
a vigilance committee of 25.U0O reformers
to cleanse the cfty of vice. He favored a
central committee of three or five men.
under whose orders the public committee
should act. The Bishop said in part :
"In New York to-morrow there could be
organized a vigilance committee such a*
was In San Fnanctsco of 23,000 men sworn
to service for three years and pledged by
night and by day, when their business and
their opportunities give them the freedom
for it, to see for themselves whether our
souls had been smitten with the sorrow
of that little victim of five years who was
picked up m the street the other day In
broad daylight and ravished by a brute
who had lived here. Would such things
be possible in a God-fearing community .*
"No, men and brethren, not If you and
I had our eyes open and kept them open
and stood where God calls us to stand to
day. And then, finally, we must have not
on.y vigilance but persistence.
"We shall not recrem New York, men
and brethren, by emotions; we shall not
redeem it by denunciation; we shall not
redeem it by pessimistic temper that
wraps Its, garment around it and turns it3
back upon It. There are burning with
zeal and enthusiasm and a high purpose
"of sacrifice in thlÂ» great city to-day great
multitudes of men and women. They are
of different religions: they must forget
that. They are of different nationalities:
they must forget that. They are of dif
ferent political associations; most of all.
they must forget that. And If. having
reached that point, we could find three or
five men whom all of us trusted and be
llexed in (there are hundreds of them) and
.say to these three or five, men: 'Now,
then, tell us what you want us to do.
i where you want me to stand, what rela
tion you want our party, our church, our
organization to bear toward the better
ment of New York. We will trust your
Judgment: we will follow your lead and
j the work Is done/ Next to that in thl9
seevice of enlightened soul we want vigi
lance."

ADVERTISEMENTS.
NO ARGUMENT NEEDED.
Every Sufferer From Catarrh Knows
That Salves, Lotions, Washes,
Sprays and Douches Do
v Not Cure.
Powders, lotions, salves, sprays and in-
halers cannot really cure Catarrh, because,
this disease is a blood disease, and local
applications. If they accomplish anything
at all. simply give transient relief.
The catarrhal poison Is In the blood and
the mucous membrane of the nose, throat
and trachea tries to relieve the system by
secreting large quantities of mucus, tha
discharge sometimes closing up the nos-
trils, dropping Into the throat, causing
deafness by closing the Eustachian tubes,
and after a time causing catarrh of stom-
ach or serious throat and lung troubles.
A remedy to really cure catarrh must b*
an internal remedy which will cleanse
the blood from catarrhal poison and re-
move the fever and congestion frcm the
mucous membrane.
The best and most modern remedies for
this purpose are antiseptics scientifically
known as Eucalyptol. Gualacol. San-
guinaria and Hydrastin. and while each
of these have been successfully used sep-
arately, yet It has been difficult to get
them all combined in one palatable, con-
venient and efficient form.
The manufacturers of the new catarrh
cure. Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, have suc-
ceeded admirably In accomplishing this
result. They are large, pleasant tasttns
lozenges, to be dissolved In the mouth,
thus reaching every part of the mucous
membrane or the throat and finally the
stomach.
Unlike many catarrh remedies, Stuart's
Catarrh Tablets contain no cocaine, opiate
or any Injurious drug whatever and are
equally beneficial for little children and
adults!
Mr. C. R. Rembrandt of Rochester. N.
T.. says: "I know of few people who have
suffered as much as I from Catarrh of
the head, throat and stomach. >. used
eprays, inhalers and powders for months
at a time with only slight relief and had.
no hope of cure. I had not the means trÂ»
make a change of climate, which seemed
my only chance of cure.
"Last spring I read an account cf som*
rerrarkable cures made by Stuarts Ca-
tarrh Tablets and promptly bought a fifty-
cent box from my druggist nna obtained
&uch positive benefit from that one pack-
age that I continued to use them dally
until I now consider mysÂ»lf> entirely freÂ»
frcm the dl?scustlnsr annoyance af catarrh:
my head Â«s clear, my digestion all I could
ask and my hearing, which had begun to
fail as a result of the catarrh, has greatly
Improved, until I feel I can hear as well
as ever. Thev are a househ>I<J necessity
In my family." , Â« .
Stuarfs Catarrh Tablets are sold by
druggists at B0 cents for comc^te treat-
ment, and for convenience. Â»afety and
prompt results they are undoubtedly the.
long looked for catarrh cure, j â¢

Induced to attempt to win her affections,

CRESCENT CITY. Nov. 23.â Search
for Walter Brooking, the youngr
huntsman of Smith River, who
disappeared more than ten days
ago in the mountain wilds of Del
Norte County, has proved unavailing, and
there ts no longer doubt that he was the
victim of foul play or a fatal accident.
For more than a week upward of 200 men
have traversed the mountains In the hope
of discovering some trace of the young
man. but beyond the finding of an empty
cartridge from his rifle near the point
where he entered the woods, there has
been nothing to reward their efforts.
Numerous theories have been advanced
to account for the hunter's failure to
reach the ranch of Paul Frederick on
Wlnchuck River, for which he had start
ed. That he became lost seems out of the
question, for he was a trained mountaln-
: Brooking was a popular young man. a
son of Mr. and Mrs. James Brooking of
Smith River, and had relatives living In
San Franciaco and Oakland. Search for
him has not been relinquished, and his
family and - friends hope to at least re
cover his body eventually. In the event
that he has perished in the mountains.
eer and knew thoroughly "the country
through. which he was to pass. Beside*,
he had with him a hound, which would
have been certain to lead him -to some hu
man habitation. The fact that this hound
has not returned to the young- man's
home gives color to the theory that
Brooking was murdered, probably by an
Indian, and that the dog was killed to
cover evidence of the crime. The only
other theory that would account for the
absence of the animal Is that Brooking
met with, some accident and was unable to
proceed on his way. and the dog refused
to leave him.
REAR ADMIRAL R. B. BRAD
FORD, chief "f the Naval Bu
reau of Equipment at \Va-*hiriK-
ton, arrived In the city yest-rduy
and registered at the Occidental.
This is his first trip to the coast in
fifteen years. ' He has come iiere In
pursuance tÂ« orders cf the Navy De
partment. Hi-* principal mission is to
see what can be dor.e relative to the
establishment of a coaling station in this
harbor.
â¢â¢The Navy Department has long had
this question under advisement." said
the admiral yesterday, "and the feeling is
that the time is now ripe to accomplish
something. We war.t a coaling station
here with a storage capacity of at least
150.000 tons. The ccal to be obtained in
this section does not give as good satis
faction as that taken from Eastern mines.
hence it is pertinent that we should have
a place here where the Eastern product
can be stored for Immediate use in case or
an emergency.
In regard to the probable location of the
coaling station Admiral Bradford said he
was not yet prepared to announce his
plarÂ« **we have a place in view, he
said, "but as It is now held by a corpora
tion whose right of claim the Govern
ment questions, I would prefer not to
make the matter public until I can find
out the exact status of things. In my
opinion the Government has a clear title
to the property." Notwithstanding the
admirals reticence, it Is practically cer
tain that the site referred to Is Mission
Reck.
A smaller coaling- station will also be
established at San Diego. It will have a
capacity of about 2S.i>jO tons. Before
cornlnc to this citv the admiral visited
Port townsend. Portland and Pug-et
Sound. At the latter place preparations
are now under way for the erection of a
cold storage plant. The adlmarl en
Â¦thuse.s over Puget Sound's splendid water

"I was much impressed by the fine
sheet of water there," he said. "It is
bold, clear and free of all danjrer from
navigation and Is quite in contrast to the
Columbia River, which. I am .afraid, can
never be properly developed. I think the
found has a great future in store for it.
There Is lots of pro-ahead and enterprise
with the people there."
Admiral Bradford will also visit the
training station and Mare Island. He ex
pects to remain in San Francisco about a
week.

PHOENIX, Ariz.. Nov. 23.-Dre!iding
the awful fate that was recently visited
upon Preston Porter, who was burned at
the stake by Colorado citizens, Ernest
Scott, a young negro of Phoenix, this
arternoon attemotea to commit suicide in
court by swallowing broken glass. The
tragedy followed his arraignment for an
attack, upon two young girts, for which
he was bound over to the Grand Jury.
Emma Eyer and Mamie Miller, aged 15
and 16 years, were returning from an en -
tertamment at the Crlttenton Hescue
Home at a o'cIock Tuesaay night, the
home being situated in the suburbs of the
city and the girls residing at no great dis
tance. In a lonely place a man sprang
from the bushes ana seized one of the.
girls, 'ine other fought until she liber
ated her companion and both ran. In their
excitment tuey collided with a barbed
wire fence ana were badly lacerated.
Their assailant had been recognzed as a
negro. A brother of one of the girls met
later the fellow still skulking around the
vicinity. He Identified him as Ernest
Scott, an ls-year-old boy who has lived
here for years. The Sheriff was notified
and the youth was arrested the next day.
He admitted having been in the vicinity,
but declared he had only accidentally
touched one of the girls as he passed by.
Scott was to-day given an examination
before Justice of the Peace Johnstone and
held to the Grand Jury. Ball was fixed
at J730, an amount beyond his ability to
give.
When the decision of Justice Johnstone
was given Scott arose, ran out his tongue
and tilled his mouth with broken glass,
which he had concealed In his hand. His
mother, who was present, saw the act,
and realizing what the boy was doing or
fearing he had taken poison, she screamed
hysterically. The bey v.as taken back to
Jail, where he said he only wished he had
some glass to eat and ena his trouble. At
a late hour to-night he was suffering
somewhat, but the time elapsing since he
swallowed the glass has not been suffi
cient for its 111 effects to be felt to a no
ticeable extent. Because of the Quantity
eaten a painful time is believed to be In
store for him, even though the result be
net fatal.

Shasta County. The secretary, Ernest
Gordon, has written to the secretary' of
the Vampire Association football team in
this city, expressing a desire to play a
match on Thanksgiving day. It Is how
ever. Improbable that a match can be ar
ranged at such short notice, especially
as eome of the Vampires will be out' of
the city on that day, and others will' be
looking on at the intercollegiate game
But later ln the season a match and a
return match, one being played In San
Francisco and the other in "Shasta County
will be arranged between the two clubs.

STANFORD IS POLISHING OFF ROUGH EDGES
HEAVY WORK IS THE ORDER AT CALIFORNIA
â¢ <â¢
fis-ff-saHESE are the days of conjecture and prejudgment at both the collegesâ Stanford and California. The football
'I situation Is the all-absorbing topic. Not a word relating to any subject other than pigskin chances and Thanks-
I giving day possibilities ls heard on cither of the college grounds and this will continue until the annual gridiron com
jl bat of 1900 ls a portion of intercollegiate athletic history
' The game this year should be a close one and from all the signs of the time the crowd that will pack the
Folsom and Sixteenth street grounds should be larger than ever. This ln itself assures a greater volume of noise and. a
wealthier display of color, those two attributes of a Thanksgiving day contest which mean as much to the general at
tendant as the game Itself. With the idea of an increased attendance in mind, the football management has made all nec
essary plans for accommodation of the spectators. Fair weather conditions will draw out a crowd such as has never
been seen in this city at any such affair. â¢'-.'-' * . . ... . _ . .
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov. 23.â With the big annual
Thanksgiving game only five days distant, the Stanford var
nity is still an uncertain quantity. Though the personnel of
the team Is practically decided, the above statement is abso
lutely true, for no one knows Just what to expect of the men
at any given time. Already the team has displayed meteoric
brilliancy' and sickening apathy. One week they defeated the
heavy Reliance team by a 44 to 0 score and the next week are
defeated by a light eleven from a fourth rate college by a
score of 6 to 0. Probably Stanford never turned out a more
brilliant or a more uncertain aggregation. It is safe to predict
that it will prove a surprise, but Just which way Js the puzzle
that is worrying the coaches.
The team is essentially a grour.d gainer. They are happy
when the ball ls in their possession and are generally sure of
their yards. The Interference which they ca.n bunch, when they
nfe In the mood would, delight th6 heart of a Camp or Stagg.
The backs, can get off together like a. bunch of wild sheep if
thn ground beneath them is firm, but if the conditions are un
favorable it is a case of each one for himself. But under nor
mal conditions the trio back of the cardinal line can be de
pended upon. Slaker at fullback Is the quickest man on the
coast to get off with the ball, and his running mates. H'.ll and
Smith, have learned to keep up with him.
* .Upon ths playing of the men in the line depends the out
come of next Thursday's contest to a great extent. Traeger
and. De Forest can be depended upon to play a steady, con
elhtent. game. I^ee, Seeley and Burnett are capable ot bril
liant work when at their best, but are mere likely \o play loose
ball than the two men on the loft side cf the line. Burnett's
injured knea may cause his early retirement from the game,
as It is now. keeping him out of even signal practice. In case
Captain Burnett does retire his place .will be filled by Tommy
McFadden at end, who In turn will be replaced by Cooper. As
matters now stand T. McFadden will go ln at right end and
either . Luck, Stanford or Erb at left end. McFadden Is the
only vetaran end on | the team and can be depended upon to
play. a steady game. "Stub" Raitt, the crack quarter, who has
been away ten days, â¢ will return fiom the south In time to go
through the last practices' with his team and will act as field
captain and cover the back field for the cardinal.
After. Monday no haavy work will be done, the men being
allowed to rest. They will be put through light signal work
only.
BERKELEY, Nov. 23.â With a horde of coaches out assist
ing- "Kins'.' Kelly of Princeton and wtth a dozen men guard-
Ing the practice field from intruding spectators, the Berkeley
football men have been spending a busy but quiet closing week
in grinding away at their gridiron secrets for Thanksgiving
dcy. ..The muddy condition of the campus has hindered their
work, but they have been kept at It vigorously and both first
and. second- elevens have been playing quick, fierce football.
The varsity has been trying under unfavorable conditions to
learn Its new plays' and perfect Its team work, which, except
on a few. rare occasions, has been too . ragged and only a dis
appointment.^ It ls to- instill into the eleven the proper fighting
spirit Â«nd to whip them Into playing together that, the coaches
are nowbendlng every effort. ?Â¦/:Â¦ V '"â¢
The great question of backs Is now considered settled.
Fullback will "be Duden, Â¦ This" important chÂ»>nge leaves
Braley and Overall out of the race.'. The - displaced men are
heavy and. strong, of remarkably perfect physique and have
displayed considerable ability in practice. Both seemed, to bÂ«
very well "fitted for the place, but their fatal defects were in
ability to start quickly and. to get off together with the other
backs. This fault could not be overcome and its existence de
stroyed team Â« work, demoralizing the -Interference and weak
ening, the, whole back field.- The choice of Duden seems rather
doubtful, although he certainly .has a style . of play that fits
easily. into that' of his partners.: As a halfback he led' all com
petitors this , year, . being only excelled by Smith. Whether he
will': make a gqod.. fullback at this; late day is a problem that

Smith plays his third season at right half. with all his old
time dash and skill. He is always sure for his distance with a
short, savage buck. His defensive work Is the best of all thÂ»
backs. As in previous years, he has trained down fine and Is at
present dangerously near to being stale
If Duden can be sure of diving through the center with, anr
degree of success the question of prround gainers is easy for
Gammon is safe at running the ends and Smith for smashing
the tacklss. &
Johnny More, In spite of a bad knee, will play quarterback
and do the punting and possibly the drop kicking. His passing
is sure and fre# from fumbling. *
The line remains a rather dubious quantity. It contains
only three of last year's seven and has had several revers**
during the season, and especially Just recently Jn recniltlnr
the remaining four. * - uini
Captain Pringle and acting Captain Womble. bunched to
gether at right tackle and end. are a notable pair, whose record
for brilliant play has been well recognized for the last two
seasons. This year Pringle started his work by fierce fast
-hard play and was putting up the best game on the field until
Ms unfortunate Injury laid him on the shelf and has kept him
quiet until this last week. His strained knee Is fax from at rone
and heals very slowly. He has for this reason hesitated to get
into any of the scrimmages and contents himself only with
signal practice and running a couple of laps on the track earh
evening to keep in condition. Trainer Al Lean has P?oml*ed

Owing to the storm during the week the
Union Coursing Park Association was un
able to run off its regular midweek re
serve stake. This was due to no plan of
th'e association, but. to the .fence-leveling
propensities of the storm, which made tho
rabbit warren a thlni? of the past. All
the pent-up hares escaped and the stake
was consequently postponed. .
When the coursing men were in Modesto
no midweek stake was run arid -the acci
dent of the present week made the sec
ond discontinuance. This has been the
only break In midweek events, for many
days. They have grown to be a feature
of coursing, as they give the owners fo
lower class hounds a chance to run their
dogs. These stakes have proved of great
er interest to the majority of the owners
than the big Saturday and Sunday stakes.
The coursing programme is devoid of
big special events'for the Immediate .fu r
ture. Regular stakes- Â¦will be the. card of
fered for some time. The regular staktB
are Improving more and more In quality
and only the highest class dogs have any
chance In- them. At Union Park to-day
and to-morrow 128 dogs of tried and meas
ured-skill will course for .fair-sized prizes.
The draw shows the fleetest and best -of
hounds. ;.'.-- - .t*
When Random Aim and Silver Wings
divided ' the money for the .open plains
meet at Modesto, the history of the meet-
Ing of Kmin Pasha and Silver Wings at
Dallas was recalled. Singularly enough,
the same owners were represented at Mo
desto, but the conditions wjere different.
At Modesto J. H. Rospeter declined to
race Random -Aim apainst .Silver Wings
because of the latter's exhaustion. At
Dallas Emin Pasha 'and Silver WingÂ«
were on an equal fqoting," but the owners
of Silver Wings, who vrere handling Emln
Pasha at the time, refused to have th<Â»
final run-off out of -courtesy, to J. II. Ros
seter.

, Hie heavy rains during the middle of
the week scattered, the ducks and drove
them away from the. ponds, but the cold

the wake has been driving the birds back
to their marshy haunts. Just when the
shooters were beginning- to despair of a
good shoot this Saturday and Sunday the
weather reversed and now they will flock
to their clubs assured of some good sport
There is a movement on foot among
certain sportsmen to establish, If not a
legal, an ethical law against the whole
sale destruction of game, no matter what
its kind. This will extend to duck shoot
ing particularly. What they object to Is
the useless bagging of a hundred or more
birds in a day or two . days' ,'i shotting.
They say that even if the wild duek is a
migratory bird, every time, unnecessary
killing is Indulged in breeders -are de
stroyed and the quantity of the species
Is certainly detrimentally diminished.

a very fair shoot was had by the mem

The team of the cardinal has showed a tendency to play
an uneven game. California has men who are veteran din
ners, whose presence steadies the work of the eleven ard will
aid in welding the entire sroup in the final week of training.
California, barring Pringle. will trot o*t on the field in better
physical condition than Stanford, for, nntrary to late news
paper statements, numerous although minor Injuries have re
tarded the general condltlonVng and phys.cal seasoning of the
men. Lee has a weak knee. Barrett a similar injury, which
may take him out of the game at any mrment: Slakes a bad
shoulder, and Smith a bad side. This quj.rtet has been kept
out of practice too oftÂ»n for the surest team development.
Stanford's defense has been weak; that of California not
strong. That element of play in each team has Improved dur
ing the past few dav*. The two defeats of last Saturday
loomed up. It was concluded that neither game demonstrated
anything of importance, save that a sloppy field would leave
the outcome of the big match to chance.
lastly: Stanford's work of the past few days was highly
satisfactory to the "grnd" of Palo Alto; that of the California
team not as heart-warming when the memory of last year'3
championship eleven presented itself to th* Berkeley player.
A resume of facts caused the California ex-player to slowly
remark:
"I must say on form, principally on the superior scorin?
force her tÂ»am has displayed, Stanford should win by a touch
down or two." *
The Stanford man agreed. But one minute later ancient
history was recalled. The facts were stated that in March.
1S92. Stanford'? supposedly weaker team won by a score of 14
to 10: that California's 1S93 team on form apparently outclassed
tied Stanford; that Stanford's 1S94 varsity won from a stronger
eleven; that the men of the blue and gold in 1S35 played a bet
ter team to a standstill of another tie on Thanksgiving day.
"We will be a very hard team to whip." said the California
man, "and if we get the jump we will win."
' "On the other hand." remarked the ex-Stanford star in *
kind of reverie of other days, "our eleven has showed itself
possessed of great scoring possibility, and It may be a repeti
tion of 1S96 and 1S97." .
Form had been smashed to smithereens by college prida
and college opinion â the case of the Kentucky colonel over
again.
After all, when game3 are anything like close, whether be
tween Yale or Harvard, Stanford or California, even from a
form sheet it is difficult to pick a winner, for sometimes, per
haps often, class horses run like well oiled machines. But col
lege boys are human, and the vagaries of spirit Â«3 reflected
from twenty-two different athletes are not likely to produce
fcrm-sheet running.
Moral: Under present conditions there is no football
"dope." J. F. SHEEHAN.
yr^>yICKERS of winners" In a sporting event is a disease,
I II *")l whether the sport be horseracing, prizefighting, base
â¢ S-^w^-ball-.or football. Just about this time on the college
; 1L: jcampus, on the street. corner. In club and office there
are enthusiasts who are determining the result of the
Thanksgiving game between' Stanford and California. Some
reason on form, others on prejudice. The conclusion reached
In. all cases is about the same. The Stanford adherent will find
after using his own form '.'dope" that the cardinal must win.
TheJCallformV adherent discovers 'the same for California.
Eliminate in a discussion of football form the meeting of
elevens of obviously different class, well trained and playing
under favorable weather conditionsâ for a field on which men
pannot run equalizes matters- materially and give3 the under
dog team the chance to win on luck, per example the two
games of last; Saturday. Twice in the history of the games of
California: and Stanford two teams were voted by those who
poseessedjthe very patint.factF relative to either teams de
velopment to be in a "much higher class than the rival eleven.
They'were- the varsity of Stanford in 1S97 and the varsity of
California in 1859; for while Stanf5rd's team won by 20 to 0 in
JS56 and California's by 22 toO in 1SW, the result was not as easy
to prophesy as the. scores Indicate. Given, however, the con
ditions of 'earller'years, when the teams were very evenly
matched and when neither college boasted of certain victory,
or given conditions as they present themselves to-day and
then apply the "form sheet'* system and note the deduction in
comparison .with the cold .mathematical answer, cf the race

Thanksgiving day game. In their ultimate object the ex
players were as the racetrack form-sheet men-seeking a con-
Bricfly. the statements agreed on as facts were these: In
the k" mes with the Reliance Athletic Club Stanford made a
decidedly better showingâ two scores of 6 to 0 and I one of 44 to
"against iTiie game-and victories for California by 5 to 0 and
II to*0 Stanford -has more men who are clever in advancing
the ball than California, even recognizing that California has
three players In Smith, the peer cf halfbacks, and Gammon,
whose recent play has been strong, and Pringle. in case his
injured knee does not bother him. all of whom are hard to
stop In short, Stanford up to date has demonstrated superior
attacking force and superior team play on the offensive.

charged with extortion, testified In his
own defense before Judge Fritz yesterday
afternoon. He is accused of attempting
to extort money from T. Mulro, a woman

money on the table where he was sitting
and hurriedly left the place. He picked
up the money to return It to Sakabe. and
when he was searched the coin, which
was marked, was found In his pocket by
the police.

is opposed to the Americans as a nation,
nor to any particular Jockey or traJner.
I airree entirely with what Mr. Corrigan
safd anl I think the touts have caused
the whole trouble. There is one fellow in
particular who tried to pass htaedf as
me and another time called himself
"keels' Martin, and when that was found
out against him he palmed himself off as
my brother. Of course, he deceived many
Ksons and that began to give us baS
names. If people 7,Â°"" l?t mealone I
would have no trouble with anybody. It
is these fellows that go across from^here
to bet on our mounts who have caused
us to be so much talked about.
"What about your engagement to nao
fO .^ri.^e n r C e e n O eve7% l |- ? a contract so I
never was really retained. Had It not
blen for all this talk though there is no
doubt I would have been. I do not.anti
cipate the least trouble In getting a li

I have been in no trouble. I do not bet
nor do I manage anybody s stable.

Commodore W. N. McCarthy of the San
Francisco Yacht Club has Issued a cir
cular to the yacht owners whose boats
are moored off the Sausalito water front
asking them to meet him at the clubhouse
to-morraw morning. The object of the
meeting is to confer upon a request made
by ex-Commodore C. H. Harrison on be
half -of the Town Council of Sausalito
that the barrels or floats sustaining' the
mooring chains of the yachts should be
removed when the yachts go out of com
mission for the winter. Certain Govern
ment vessels desire to spend the winter at
Sausalito and it is said that the town will
derive much financial , and social benefit 1
from the presence of the vessels, which
find the- moorings of the yachts in their
way. There Is danger of a steamer get
ting her propeller foul of the chains at
tached to the mocring-barrels and seri
ously entangling her.
Commodore McCarthy says that he feels
satisfied that the yacht owners can com
ply with the request with very little
trouble or expense to themselves, and
thinks that they ought to be willing- to
help the tradespeople of Sausalito In the-lr
financial Interests and the residents In
their social ambitions. The yacht owners,
on the other hand. say. that they have a
prior right to their mooring ground, and
ought not to be dlspossessediby any ves
sel, whether owned by private parties or
the Government of the United States.
They ear that the Government vessels can
anchor outBide the line of smaller craft
or off Hurricane Gulch, and are riot in
clined to think it a great hardship that the
officers, when visiting their Sausallto
friends, have to be rowed a few hundred
yards in a nice gig manned by bluejack
ets. The yacht owners also say that if
they once allowed the water near the
clubhouse to be occupied by Government
vessels they would never' be able to get
It back. A season or two ago a Govern
ment vessel tried. to run down the moor
ings of the sloop Nixie, supposing the
barrel to be a wooden one. but. when it
turned out to be of stout iron, they con
cluded that it would be better to let it
alone in the future, as if did more in-
Jury to the charging vessel than to the
iron buoy. . > _
The storm , of * Tuesday night caused
considerable commotion among the yachts
lying, at moorings off the Sausallto
clubhouse. L. Sherman's yawl Royal,
now chartered by F. A. Hyde, was carried
away and wrecked in the angle formed
by. the ferry slip and the wharf. She
filled and sank. On Thursday afternoon
a scow was brought alongside, to which
she was made fast. The two were then
towed by the launch Envoy to Old Sausa
lito. Dr. T. L. Hill's sloop Cygnus, which
had sailed up last. Sunday from South
San Francisco, broke loose from her
moorings and was carried over to Belve
dere Island, â¢where she was âÂ¦ thrown ; up
broadside . on the rocks. She was taken
off at high tide on Friday; and beached
near Smith's boat : building shop. :

THE Merchants' Athletic Club gave
Its initial boxing exhibition last
night at Woodward's Pavilion be
fore an audience so small that It
sent the chills up and down the
managerial spinal column. All told about
500 spectators were scattered on the
benches. Harry McGlnnis refereed the
contests from start to finish. .
The first bout was between Jack Scott
and Willie Boren. It lasted the full four
rounds. Boren- petting the dec'slon. Then
Roy and McFadden mixed matters for thÂ«?
limit of rounds, Roy winning out by a de
cision.
Mike Easan nnd Mike Curtln foujrht s->
hard and so well that an extra round was
necessary before the referee could settle
upon Curtln as the winner.
Kid Flnnerty polished off Jim Carney
In two rounds. A stiff jo'.t did the trick
and Carney slept for more than ten sec
onds. Ed Hanlon and Tom Davidson
went- the four stages, which jrsve Hanlon
the. right to wear something on his eheÂ»t.
The concluding mJx-up was between Kid
Williams and William. Conlan. Four
rounds of spasmodically fast flgfttin?
ended In doubt for the referee, s* he
ordered the fifth. Williams played ca
Conlan's basement and top story In this

< While the people of Russia know nothing of the

1 â S.ISPATCHES from Washington announce that
I ) Senator Morgan, chairman of the Committee
*â^ on Interoceanic Canals, has received personal
assurance from President McKinley and Secretary
Hay that they wish the pending bill for the construc
tion of the Nicaraguan canal passed at the coming
session. The dispatch confirms previous reports from
other sources and strengthens the hope that we may
see the bill enacted and the great enterprise begun
during the coming year.
The bill now before the Senate is the one which
passed the House at the last session. The Senate
calendar contains a' special order providing that the
bill be taken up at 2 p. m. December 10. \ It is prob
able that before that time the report of the Canal
Commission will be in the hands of the Senate, and
consequently the Senators will have all the informa
tion attainable on the subject. There will then be no
occasion for further delay in the matter, and a prompt
passage of the act may be confidently expected.
It will be remembered the act provides that the
United States shall acquire from Nicaragua and Costa
Rica control of the territory through which the cana)
will pass, empowers the Secretary of War to construct
the waterway and to fortify it, appropriates $10,000,
000 for beginning the work, and limits its total cost
to $140,000,000.
The bill ignores the Hay-Pauncefote treaty, and it
was that fact which mainly prevented its passage at
the last session. We were then on the eve
of a Presidential election, and the Bryanites
thought they could make good campaign ma
terial by objecting to the treaty, and as a
result the whole measure was brought to a
standstill. The election is now over, and as the meas
ure itself is a non-partisan one, favored by all the
great interests of the country except the trans
continental railroads, it is quite likely the contest over
the treaty will be in some way satisfactorily arranged
and an agreement reached by which action can be
taken as the President is said to desire.
It is to be noted that Senator .Morgan is quoted
as saying that at this session the treaty and the canal
bill will be dealt with separately, and he is also re
ported as expressing the opinion that the two. are
quite independent of cne another. It is not easy to
see how that view of the case can be upheld, but th
public will not exact strict logic from. the Senators
on a matter of this kind. The American people wish
the canal constructed as promptly as possible, and
they also wish all treaty obligations honestly fulfilled.
It is quite certain, however, that Great Britain would
not Interpose any objections to our control of the
waterway, and, furthermore, is not in a position to
enforce objections if any were made. Such being the
case, the treaty can hardly be anything more than in
ternational fair dealing, and it would seem the Senate
might willingly ratify it.
The one thing certain about the whole matter is that
the American people are comparatively indifferent to
NICARAGUAN CANAL BILL.
REPORTS from Washington announce the re
ception in that city of private advices to the
effect that at a Papal consistory which is to
assemble December 17 one or more of the represen
tatives of the church in America may be created Car
dinals. The dispatch is careful to state that the an
nouncement is entirely unofficial, but it has been ac
cepted as fairly accurate, and a good deal of specula
tion is going on concerning it.
There are vacancies enough in the College of Car
dinals to justify the expectation that at least two
Americans may receive appointments. The latest is
sue of the official La Gerarchia Cattolica stated re
cently that during the Pontificate of Leo XIIIâ 1878
to 1900 â no fewer than 134 Cardinals have died. Only
four still live who were his fellow Cardinals under his
predecessor, Pius IX. The normal number of the
college is seventy, but thirteen of the seats are at pres
ent unoccupied. Seven Cardinals died in 1899, and
four have died during the present year. More than
half of the present college (31) arc Italians, 23 of whom
reside in the Curia at Rome; 7 are French, 4 Austrian-
Hungarian, 9 Spanish and 7 German; there is 1 Pole,
1 Portuguese, 1 Belgian, 1 North American, 1 Irish
man, 1 Australian and 1 Englishman. The oldest
Cardinal, Luigi di Canossa, Bishop of Verona, is in
his ninety-second year; the youngest, Giuseppe
Calasanzio Vioes y Tuto, is 44 years old.
It will be seen that although the Pope was an old
man when elected, and even then regarded as being
iu feeble health, he has survived most of the men who
took part in his election. He has now become, how
ever, very feeble indeed, and a report from Rome of
the 22d stated that the effort of making a
visit to St. Peter's so exhausted him that he fainted
twice. In the very nature of the human constitution
the venerable Pontiff cannot hope 'to live much
longer, and it is therefore the more likely that he may
take occasion at this consistory to show once more
the favor with which he regards the American branch
of the church. Thus, while nothing definite can be
known of the intentions of the Pope, the ready ac
ceptance given to the advices received at Washington
is not without good reason to justify it.
THE POPE AND THE CARDINALS.
After tbr Supreme Court has decided one branch
of the vexatious subject, its other features will be con
sidered, each in its time, and if the people conclude
we are to stay in the Philippines we will stay there as
the representatives of justice, and if to withdraw we
will do it with honor and a stainless and unbroken
prestige.
We commend this moderate and temperate state
ment to the extremists on both sides of the question,
while by no means admitting that the tariff issue is
all that is in the question of these acquisitions. The
Philadelphia platform was wisely inconclusive of the
matter. It left it tentative and open. The people
had not then made up their minds nor have they now.
They gave no attention to Mr. Bryan's "paramount
issue" because they wire not ready for it. They were
not ready to fix the destiny of the Philippines, and
simply refused to fix it the way Mr. Bryan proposed
at the risk of a domestic overturning that would have
been as 6erious as a revolution.
That others have been in accord with the adminis
tration, while holding our view of this issue, is
proved by the interview with Mr. George H. Ray,
chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the House.
He says that until the Supreme. Court decides the
Porto Rico case there will^be no tariff legislation for
the Philippines, and that if the court decides the Porto
Rican tariff unconstitutional "it may necessitate our
having to give up the Philippines. We are bound
to maintain the open door in the Philippines. That
means that the products of all nations can enter the
Philippines on the same basis as our own. If we
cannot raise a tariff against the products of the Phil
ippines coming into The United States, then our labor
would be brought into competition with the cheap
kbor of the Orient. If that condition should come
about, we might feel that our interests would demand
our withdrawal from the Philippines."
The Porto Rican tariff has been much discussed.
Its leading purpose was to get a tpeedy judicial deci
sion of the status of Porto Rico, and by parity
of position, that of the Philippines also.
The American system of protection has been urged
ar.d vindicated, largely in the justifiable fear of tropical
labor competition. We have insisted on the open
door in Asia, and if we have a door there we cannot
be justified in closing it. But if that door be
under our whole constitution, and must be kept open,
our entire protective tariff falls to the ground. If the
Philippines are part of the American Union, and are
an open door to the commerce of the world, it is
just the same as if we declared New York a free port
with no tariff restrictions.
The people have great common sense. They saw
things face to face, uid not through partisan eyes,
ncr with partisan pre;udice. We antagonized the
theory that the constitution follows the flag, in the
sense of being wholly installed and operative every
where that conquest or treaty may send the flag. As
**e lonp ?.po pointed cut, the serious issue involved
is the production of a surplus in the tropics for com
merce. Tropical possessions have no other value for
temperate zone owners than that surplus.
ALL of the contingencies that can arise in our
new tropical relations were foreseen and fore
told by The Call. While others w'ere taking
a rosy view of torrid acquisitions, we were not in
fluenced by the optimism or the pessimism of de
baters *ho chose to sre only cither extreme. We re
fused to join in attacks upon the administration for
taking the Philippines, for we were perfectly well
nwarc that those who made them would have as read
ily and venomously, und for partisan purposes, have
attacked the administration for not taking the Phil
ippines had it abstained in that particular. No critic
has yet selected any one step taken by President
McKinley, since the Spanish war began, and soberly
stated how a different course, and what course, could
have been taken at that time.

29.- "How. can one enter Into the house
of a strong man and spoil (1. e., steal) hu
goods?" It is now almost limited In mean

A company may organize In California for

corporate in California and do business
in another portion of United States terri

do business in California, subject to the
laws of California.
BAN JOSE RAILROADâ S. P. D., Sac-
ramento, Cal. Timothy Dames was the
first president of the San Francisco and
San Jose Railroad. The company was In
corporated July 21, 1SG0. On October 19.
1563, the first train passed over the road
from the Mission Dolores (Sixteenth and
Valencia streets) to Big Tree Station on
San Francisquita Creek. On January 16
1564, the road was completed to San Jose.
Trains commenced running to that place
on that date. On February 14 the line
was extended to the corner of Brannan
and Fourth streets from the Mission. The
road was never operated from "the Junc
tion of Market and Fremont streets,"
for the reason that there is no such Junc
tion in San Francisco.
IN CASE OF A TIEâ A. M. C, City. To

event of a tie between two candidates
the constitution of the United States pro
vides what shall be done. Amendment
XII says: "And If no person have such
majority, then from the persons having
the highest numbers, not exceeding three
on the list of those voted for as Presi
dent, the House of Representatives shall
choose Immediately by ballot the Presi
dent. But in choosing the President the
vote shall be taken by States, the repre

COXEY'S ARMY-G. H. B.. City. When
Coxey's army reached "Washington, D. C
April 29, 1894, he had 3S6 men. These pa
raded to the Capitol grounds May 1. A
strict construction of the law of Congress
prohibiting unofficial processions or pa

COLUMBUSâ X. Y. Z.. MarysvlllÂ©, Cal.
C. K. Adams In Johnson's Universal
Cyclopedia, issue of 1SS7, â¢ has the fol
lowing relative to the removal of the
bones of Columbus: "After temporary
burial at Valodolia and Seville, the re
mains of the great explorer were trans
ferred to the cathedral In San\DomlnKO
some time* before the year 1549. At a later
period the remains of other members of
the admiral's family found the same r*Â»<Â«t
ing place. In the year 1796 a vault in the
cathedral, supposed to contain the bones
of the discoverer, was opened and the
contents were removed with great cere
mony to Havana. In 1S71 and 1891, how
ever, evidence was discovered that th*
vault opened in 1796 was not that In which
were the remains of the admiral, but that
of one of the other members of the fam
ily. It may therefore be regarded **
established beyond doubt that the aihw
of the discoverer still rest in the-cltht
dral at San Domingo.", Another authority
eays: "The remains of Columbus wpri
carried in 1536 to San Domingo and in 17SÂ«

From Lord Rosebery's "Napoleon."
Europe buckled Itself to the unprc cedented task of paRRlnp and paralyz
ing an intelligence and a foreÂ© that were too gigantic for the welfare anu se
curity of the world. T..at Is the strange, unique, hideous problem which
makes the records of St. Helena so profoundly painful and fascinating:.
_ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢
He fascinated MalUand, who took him to England, as hÂ© had fascinated
Ussher, who had conducted him to Elba, Maitland caused Inquiries to be
made, after Napoleon had left the Bellerophon, as to the feelings of the crew.
and received as the result: ""Well, they may "abuse that man as much as
they please, but If the people of England knew . him. as, well as we do, they
would not touch a hair of his head," When hÂ© left the Northumberland the
crew were much of the same opinion: "He is a finÂ© fellow, who does not de
serve his fate."
On the Emperor's coffln-platÂ© his followers desired to place the simple In
scription, "Napoleon," with the date and place of his birth and death. Sir
Hudson refused to sanction this unless "Bonaparte" were added. But the
Emperor's suite f.clt themselves unable to agree to the style which their mas
ter had declined to accept. So there was no name on tha coffin. It seems
incredible, but it Is true.
In France Napoleon used to be. known not as General, or Consul, or Em
peror, but as "The Man" (1'Homme). In his conversation he never forgets
his greatness, or allows others to forget It. "Had I died at Moscow, I should
have left behind me a reputation as a conqueror without & parallel In his
tory. A ball ought to have put an end to me there. â¢ *. â¢ To die at Bor
odino would have been to die like Alexander; to be killed at "Waterloo would
have been a good death; perhaps Dresden would have been better; but no
better at Waterloo."
THE CORSICAN IN EXILE.
r\ CCORDING to a report of a correspondent of
j\ the Pall Mall Gazette the citizens of Paris are
just now going through a spasm of indigna
tion over the wretched stuff sold to them for table
wine. * The outbreak was caused by a disclosure of a
glaring case of fraud in the wine trade of the city. It
appears a certain dealer had been offering a wine that
tasted about as well as vin ordinaire at a price much
lower than that charged by I his rivals in the trade.
An investigation of his stock was made by the author
ities and it was found to be stuff hardly fit to be called
wine even by the conventionality of trade.
The correspondent of the Gazette says: "The com
pound was made up of a very slight trace of sound
wine, of a mixture of wines that had gone bad and
were unfit for human consumption, of 40 per cent of
water â doubtless Seine waterâ and of chemicals of all
sorts, including potash, lime, barytes, and tartaric,
citric, phosphoric and sulphuric acids. Between two
and three hundred casks a day, of this stuff have been
sold regularly for a long time past. It is certain, too,
that this 'brewer' is only an exception in respect to
his prices. There are scores of other worthies who
sell an equally deleterious beverage, but charge rather
more for' it."
When that sort of stuff is "brewed" and sold for
wine inParis the American demand for French labels
on wine appears rao'e ridiculous than ever. Of course
not all French wine is of that character, but even the
best of it is not sufficiently superior to American wine
to make.it worth while for our dealers to imitate
French labels and names or for our people to pay
fancy prices for the imported article.
The New York Commercial. Journal in discussing
the subject recently said: "There is one merit claimed
for the American champagne which should find it
especial favor, as compared with the French. It
makes and carries its own honest flavor, which is the
result of the peculiar sort of grape used in the making;
whereas it is declared that the French champagne has
! no flavor until it is added through the medium of
other liqueurs at the end of the fermenting process.
In other words, the French flavor is made, the Ameri
can is born. If American users of champagne would
be careful not to confound the true champagne with
the imitation or carbonated sort they would discover
j that a very superior quality of champagne is made in
their native land." .
These discussions of the comparative merits of
American and French wines, it is to be noted, are
largely the outcome of the action of the authorities of
the Paris "Exposition in refusing to permit American
wines bearing French names to compete for prizes,
and as the discussion tends to increase the prestige of
cur home wines we have no reason to regret the ac
tion taken. It may, in fact, not be very long before
i unscrupulous French dealers may be caught trying to
get a market for their discredited wines by marking
them with Californian names.

NEW TORK TIMES-The calling of a
special session of tire Congress elected at
the same time with a President has be
come almost a fixed role of political pro
cedure. When a President, as Is Mr. Mc-
Klnley's good fortune, is not only chosen
to succeed himself but has had a Con
gress in sympathy with him during tha
fcecond half of his first term there cannot
commonly be any good reason for a spe
cial session of the new Congress. If it
becomes necessary to call a special session
for the 4th of the coming March the re
responsibility will bo upon the present
Senate.
BOSTON TRANSCRIPT-Our relations
with other nations have become more
practical than at any other time la our
: history. The attitude of our peopla
should reflect our status. We should
neither be nationally petulant under tho
censuro of foreign statesmen nor child
ishly pleased with their praise. We should
recognize that our actions are no longer
closely limited to our domestic concerns,
but Interest a world in which therÂ© are
many nations of many minds. We should
take the position and maintain the status
of a nation of adults In our attitude to
ward the opinion of foreign nations.
CHICAGO JOXJRXALâ We maintain no
vast standing army, but our military
prowess is respected universally. At a
month's notice we could swarm upon an
enemy as w<s did upon llttl* Spain and
overwhelm him. We have a superb and
increasing navy, manned by material
there 'a no beating. In commerce we are
world-famous. We feed with our plenty
the foreign rac?s abroad. We can lend
gold to impoverished governments. Our
manufactures are in universal use. Our
machinery clangs in Transvaal mines and
our iron bridges span brawling rivers in
the Soudan. We are courted for our re
sources, esteemed for our power.
PITTSBURO DISPATCHâ The weak
ness of the British array was exposed dur
ing the early months of the conflict until
it learned to adopt Boer methods The
weakness of British statecraft is being
exhibited now through its inability to es
tablish such a government as it promised
and for which it pretended the war was
undertaken. But the worst stage has
not yet been reached, nor will it be until
the English Government attempts to ex
tract from the mine owners the cost of
the campaign. Many of them are foreign
ers who will appeal to their governments
against being burdened with extortions
far in excess of those imposed under Boer
rule.
HARTFOR'D COURANT- Thirty or
forty years ago writers and readers took
delight in the delicacies and beauties of

was imitated by young aspirants. This
tasto was not cultivated or stimulated by
professors of literatureâ the Idea of mak

would have been deemed absurdâ It was
a natural and widely disused sentiment
among all persons of any education. It

the treaty, but are eager for the canal. They will not
look with favor upon any faction in the Senate that
tries to use the one as a means to postpone the con
struction of the other. That much is well under
stood, and consequently the long desired beginning of
work appears about to be realized at last.
rROM that questionable authority, the New
York Journal, comes the statement that the ad
ministration proposes to take the Chinese port of
Amoy as our share in the partition of that empire.
To this is added the further questionable statement
that "the State Department to-day abandoned all dis
cussion of a mere port, and that a good slice of terri
tory is to be this country's share when the carving is
done is certain." The form of this statement stamps
it with improbability. It is probable that the fact
that the State Department has not discussed the ac
quisition of a port at all is put in the deceptive form
that it has abandoned such discussion for a wider
measure.
The Call's information is that the President is press
ing the other powers to reduce their forces in China,
and, as far as Germany is concerned, is waiting to let
that Government more fully reveal its purpose.
Meanwhile our Minister, Mr. Conger, who has
shown signs of infection with the German idea of re
venge and aggrandizement, has been instructed to
favor only such indemnity demand as China can com
ply with.
Our information is also to the effect thatÂ»the United
States feels the embarrassment of being represented in
China by Conger, who has a motive, personal in its
nature and vengeful in its character, which affects
him personally in his negotiations with that Govern
ment; but a change is deemed inexpedient as long as
our Minister will obey orders and represent the policy
of his Government, and not his personal animus.
In this view of the case the statement of the Jour
nal appears to have for its motive the further embar
rassment of our Government by making it appear to
the other powers that our policy does not reflect our
real motives. It is easily seen that the enlargement
of such a rumor is intended to destroy the confidence
of other nations in. our good faith, and make them
insist more stoutly than ever upon their policy of de
manding what China cannot grant, with the delib
erate purpose of taking the country itself in payment
of a mulct to which its resources cannot possibly re
spond.
Again, the embarrassment proposed by the Journal
has a domestic purpose, as well as foreign. It is in
tended to promote a public opinion at home that will
press territorial designs upon the administration. We
have already seen the Journal engaged in such busi
ness. It did its wprst to promote sentiment in favor
of taking the Philippines, and then belabored the ad
ministration for taking them.
At present there is no perceptible sentiment in this
country in favor of sharing China with Europe, or
extending our jurisdiction there at all.
The President has conducted the difficult matter so
far with admirable humanity and discretion, and Ins
done so in the midst of the greatest difficulties. The
people understand our policy to be the integrity of the
Chinese empire; the progressive withdrawal of for
eign military forces from its soil; the demand of an
indemnity which China can pay without undue oppres
sion of her people, and the maintenance ,of the open
door for commerce. Xo one has any authority for
saying that this reasonable and proper policy has
veiled any sinister purpose, or any intention to emerge
from it in the company of the blood and land seekers
of Europe.
The President's declared policy is popular. It was
one of the considerations which favorably affected the
country toward him in the late campaign. It was in
dorsed at the polls. ,
In recognition of its popularity it was assailed dur
ing the campaign. Using the vengeful criticisms of
some American missionaries as a pretext, the same
influence which controls the New York Journal as
sailed it as an abandonment of American interests,
and when the President bct?an reducing military
forces in China he was accused of "scuttling" out of
that country and leaving American affairs uncared for
and unprotected. To all this petty and obvious par
tisan misrepresentation the people gave no heed, and
there is no reason for believing that the same in
fluences can now induce them to change their attitude.

TherÂ© Is but one fault tn "The Vicar of
Wakefleld." perhaps two; It is all too
short, and ln Its closing chapters the
story Is huddled up ln a way sadly Inar
tistic. The novelist's tender heart could
not endure to keep his creations long ln
misery. He must restore every one of
them to his former happiness, and so thÂ«
closing chapters are a mere chaos of re
unions and happy restorations, some of
them far beyond the verjre of probability.

Goldsmith's charming novel "The Vicar

It Is a loving picture of simple rural Ufa

which permeates every chapter. The sim

Thomas J. Welch, a well-known pioneer
architect of this city, created a commo
tion yesterday morning ln United States
Commissioner Heacock's courtroom by
falling to the floor In a faint. He was a
witness ln the case of Von Schrocder
against Brittain, and was explaining a
diagram hung on the wall, when he began
to sink to the floor. He was caught by
two of the attorneys and laid gently on
the floor. Mr. Welch was unconscious
and a physician from .the office of the
Marine Hospital was hastily summoned'
Mr. Welch recovered in about ten min
utes. He explained that for the past three
years he had been a sufferer with sciatic
rheumatism, and that while he was testi
fying a sudden and excruciating pain
caught him in the small of the back near
the spine, paralyzing him for the moment
and causing him to lose consciousness.

money, and when he received the coin
he boarded a car and started for town.
But one person saw him alive after that
time. Assistant District Engineer P.
Shaughnessy of the Fire Department says
that an Italian, accompanied by a little
boy, passed the house of engine 15 on
Market street, near Eleventh, during the
evening and complained of a pain in his
head. The latter said he had been thrown
from a street car and hurt.
After Bartolomeo's body waa discovered
yesterday morning Detective Ryan was
detailed to solve the mystery. As near
as he can learn Bartolomeo went into the
basement where he waa found before 10
o'clock Thursday evening. Two employes
of the Lick House heard heavy snoring
about that time, and one of them, Oscar
Jacobson. says that a man who Is be
lieved to have been the thief passed down
the stairway and remained there some
time.
Detective Tom Ryan by Conductor T. L.
Rheinhart of Kentucky street car No.
943 is as follows:
"The Italian rode from town on my car
and after we passed Twenty-second street
at a high rate of epeed he rose from hia
seat and jumped off backward. He lost
his footing and rolled over several times.
We stopped the car, finding that the man
was unconscious, and waited until he had
been carried Into a fruit jstore across tho
street. I did not know tpe extent of his
injuries at the time." Â¦;
The Italian intended tQ visit the Ken
tucky Hotel at 1322 Kentucky street. This
is between Twenty-second and Twenty
third, and he tried to alight directly in
front of the door. After being thrown
from the car Bartolomeo soon regained
consciousness. He bled from the ears,
but no further serious results were an

Two other actors shine among the wits
of the dayâ Colman and Poote. Of these
the latter was undoubtedly the leading
comic wit of the period. Even Dr. John-
Bon was not proof against his sallies:
"The flrtt tlma I was ln company with
Foote." declares the doctor, "was at Fltzher
bert's. Havlnff no Rood opinion of the fellow
I was resolved not to be pleased ; and It la
very difficult to please a man acalnst his win.

affecting not to mind him. But the doe wai
so very comical that I was obliged to lay down
my knife and fork, throw myself back upon mr
chair, and fairly laugh It out. No, sir, hÂ» was
irreilntlble."
On another occasion Johnson rammed
up Foote by saying: "For loud, obstrejv-
Garrick played around with him a fond vi
vacity, taking hold of the breasts of his coat
and looking- up ln hi* face with a lively arch
ness, complimented him on the good health
which he seemed then to enJoy; while the aa*e
shaking his head, beheld him with a gentle
complacency."
.We get a glimpse now and then of the
great Gibbon, "with hiariisual sneer," of
Sheridan and Colman, with their efferves
cent spirits, and. Indeed, of all the lead-
Ing figures of that most fertile age. But,
above all these, ruling the club with an
iron hÂ»nd. towers the figure of the great
literary dictator. Dr. Johnson. He was
always the center of every jonverpation,
and always the leader. All voices ceased
when he begun to speak. "A German
who sat next to him (Goldsmith) and per
ceived Johnson rolling himself as If he
was about to speak suddenly 3topped him.
eaying: 'Stay, stay! Toctor Shonson Is
going to say something." Thi3 feeling
wns univeisal. thnuarh perhaps Goldsmith
was at times a little jealous. Xo opinion
could stand above th*Â» great dictator's.
"There is no arguing with Johnson," de
clared his friend. Dr. Taylor, "for he will
not hear you, and. having the louder
vo'ce, mutt wear ycu down.
All were wits in that company. Burke
Is not often thought of as a humorist, yet
his bon . mots â¢ ars numerous and often
brilliant. Many have been recorded by
Boswell. The great orator once declared
of Lord Thurlow tftat "he was a sturdy
oak at Westminster and a willow at St.
James." Some one once observed that
thÂ«* party calling themselves: democrats
was not holding together. "Ah," said
Btirke, "birds of prty are not gregarious."
His retort when Mayor Scott, a small
man, interrupted him during his great
speech against Warren Hastings Is well
known. "Am I," he thundered, "to be
teased by the barking of this Jackal while
I am attacking the royal ttger of Ben
gal?" â¢ *
In marked contrast with the dignified
and ponderous Johnson stood tho viva
cious and voluble little actor, Garrick, "a
short punch man, very lively and bust
line," as the old sexton at Stratford once
described him. His activity and exuberant
spirits made dullness impossible. Note
the picture drawn by Boswell. Johnson
has just entered tho room:.
Johnson's hatred of Scotland crops out
constantly in Boswell's biography. After
the tour in the Hebrides lioawell hoped
that his friend would have a better opin
ion of the country.
"You have now been in Scotland, sir,
and say if you did not see meat ar.d
drink enough there." "Why. yes, sir,"
answers Johnson, "enough to give the
inhabitants sufficient strength to run
away from home. â¢ â¢ â¢ It Is a very vile
country, to be sure." "Well, sir, God
made it." "Certainly Jle did; but we must
always remember that He made it for
Scotsmen, and â comparisons are odlous^ â
but God made heil." ,
In February, 17Â«, "was founded, to
use the words of Boswell, "that club
which existed long without a name, but
at Mr. Garrick's funeral became distin
guished by the title of the Literary
Club. Sir Joshua Reynolds had the
merit of being the first proposer of it, to
which Johnson acceded, and the original
members were Sir Joshua Reynolds, Dr.
Johnson, Mr. Edmund Burke, Dr. Nu
gent, Mr. Beauclerk. Mr. Langton. Dr.
Goldsmith, Mr. Cramier and Sir John
Hawkins. They met at the Turk's Head
in Gerrard street, Soho, one evening every
week at 7 o'clock and generally continued
their conversation unti) a pretty late
hour. This club has \>fin gradually in

This club was the cent*-? of English wit,
and, indeed, of English* literature, until
the nearlng storm of thj French revolu

gifted group of men at ine Turk's Head,
at Prince's, in SackvilCe street, at Le

merry nights at the Mermaid Inn. where
Shakespeare and Ben Jonson held their
wit combats, or the morn sober meetings
at Will's coffee-house, where Dryden so
long ruled supreme. Here, however,
there was a recording pen. All these
merry evenings, with their wit and wis
dom, their touches of genius, their quips
and sallies, live for us in the pages of
Bcswell. Xo other body of English wits
and men of genius is known to us so Inti
mately as this.
To read the pages of this garrulous old
biographer is like stepping into the very
presence of the great Jbhnson and his
companions. We laugh ' and joke with
them, we see them off their guard, we lis

fun and good spirits; we hear Goldsmith
"rattling away, as usual." a vain, droll,
grotesque little figure, the life and de
light of the whole party: we see much of

He shifted his trumpet and only took snuff.
"He repeated to us," writes Boa well, "ln his

It 13 not worth while being- a duncÂ» now. when
there are no wits.' "
There was little of genuine humor ln
Johnson's composition; he lacked Intuition
and sympathy, but. he had an enormous
fund of caustic wit. "Johnson's dex
terity in retort." says Boswell, "when he
seemed to be driven to an extremity by
his adversary, was very remarkable,"
and It was the testimony of Garrick that
"Rabelais and all other wits are noth
ing compared with. him. You may be
diverted by them; but Johnson gives you
a forcible hug and shakes laughter out
of you whether you will or no." No one
could get the better of him ln the way of
retort. "There la no arguing with. John

pistol misses fire he knocks you down
with the butt end of it." His wit was un

tne true humori3t. The grotesque llttlÂ»
octor who came to the meetings ot the
club ln bloom-colored coat, who In tho
word3 of Boswell. "to divert thÂ» tedious
minutes strutted about bragginsr of hi3
dress," and who, whenever he tried to
lead the conversation was frowned down
by the great dictator, was after all thÂ«
one man of tho period who possessed all
tho elements which go to make up genuine
humor. Oliver Goldsmith was a critic as
well as a poet. He had the somewhat
rare power of detaching himself from his
subject and viewing It from a neutral
standpoint. In his "Citizen of tho "World"
he criticized English society from tha
point of view of a Chinese traveler who
writes letters home to his countrymen.
Always he seems to be looking down upon
human life from an outside vantags
ground, and yet ho writes as one who
knows human society intimately from
cloiÂ«a contact with It. Few follies and
weaknesses escape him. In his "Cltiaen
of the World" he touches nearly Â©very
foible and folly ln the society of his day,
and there Is no mistaking hfs condemna
tion of them: yet he Is never severe, newer
cruel and bitter. Beneath his scarlet coat
and gorgeous ruffles, for which his tailor
was never to receive payment, there beat
one of the kindest hearts In all thÂ»
worH. "His ridicule." says Mlnto, "Is
always on the side of pood sense and rood
feeling, and he handles even his embodi
ments of folly and weakness, tenderly, as
if he loved them,' as If at least be had a
lurking toleration for them, and Becretly
recognized their claim to exist ln their
own way as varieties of multiform
humanity."
The Chinese traveler describes an Eng

feast of reason and a flow o* erxhllaratlnr

he Is disappointed. No sooner were thÂ»

Gilmondo Bartolomeo Dies as Result of Injury
Received and Ghouls Rob the Corpse.
alLMONDO BARTOLOMEO, a
miner, after laboring in the
northern counties of California
for ten years, came to San
Francisco two days ago en route
to Italy, where he was to join his wife
and daughter after a long separation. He
was to have departed yesterday morning,
but while the train on which he had ar
ranged to make the journey was steam
ing toward the East, his body lay in the
Morgue and detectives searched the city
for evidence that WQuld explain the man
ner of his sudden death. The money
which was to have paid the expenses of
the trip had been stolen from him, and
by ghouls, as far as the police have been
able to ascertain.
Shortly after 7 o'clock yesterday morn-
Ing Bartolomeo's body was found at the
foot of a flight of stairs leading down to
the basement entrance to the Woman's
Exchange on Ver Mehr street, off Kearny,
between Sutter and Post. The man's
skull had been fractured and blood flowed
from his ears. His pockets had been
rifled and everything of value, except one
nickel watch, taken from him.
The body was discovered by Mrs. Heas,
employed in the Woman's Exhange, and
she at once notified Policemen George
Douglass and Patrick Curry. Noting evi
dences of a foul crime, to which robbery
had been added, the officers called the
Morgue officials and the detectives.
For a time the case appeared mysteri
ous. Orlando Stefani, a cousin of the de
ceased, made a statement that Bartolo
meo had been robbed of a watch and
about $70 In coin. The position of the
body when found clearly proved that a
fall down the stairs had not produced
death, and the only reasonable surmise
that could be made was that the unfor
tunate Italian's life had been destroyed
by. thugs who had stained their hands in
blood for petty treasure.
Later Detective Ryan discovered that
Bartolomeo had received injuries by fall
ing from a car ln the Potrero on the
previous afternoon and that a fractured
skull had probably been the result. That
robbery had been commflted, and most
likely upon the cold and lifeless body,
has now been clearly proven. The thieves
may have used violence, but the police
think their victim Â¦was either dying or
dead before they came upon him.
Bartolomeo came from Guerneville to
San Francisco two days ago. He had
spent ten years mining ln the State and
was about to make a trip to Italy. He
secured a room in a lodging-house at 412
Broadway, and then forwarded what
money he could spare to Italy. G. Grorgl,
a fellow-laborer, was to accompany him
on the trip, and Thursday afternoon the
two arranged for their tickets. They paid
the money, but were not to have received
the transportation until 7 o'clock yester
day morning. ' Thursday Bartolomeo
spent with his cousin, Stefani, and other
friends.
In the evening he went to the Potrero
for the purpose of collecting a small bill
that was due him, ami while stepping
from a moving streÂ«t-car received the in
juries which probably caused his death.
The report made by Autopsy Surgeon T.
XV. B. Leland shows that beneath the
fracture at the base of the skull consid
erable blood had coagulated on the brain.
In the physician's opinion, the fracture
Itself, although extensive, would not pro
duce death immediately, but after several
hours the clot of blood, bearing on the
brain matter, would l.rinjr unconscious
ness and later fatal results.
Tbe account of the .-incident as given to
Officer Is Accused of Having Made False Returns as to a
Parade of His Command.
CAPTAIN NIPPERT OF COMPANY F, FIRST
REGIMENT, TO BE COURT-MARTIALED
CAPTAIN FIRMAN A. NIPPERT,
commanding Company F, First
Regiment, National Guard of
California, will appear on the
10th of next month ln the Page
street armory for trial before a court
martial to answer to a charge of having
made a false return as to his compan/
in connection with the parade on the 10th
of September, Admission day. The fol
lowing have been named by Briga-
General Warfleld, . Second Brigade, as
the court: Lieutenant Colonel J. P.
Hayes, Fifth Infantry; Major John H.
Hendy, engineer officer, Second Brigade;
Captain Charles Jansen, Troop A, cav
alry; Captain George H. "Wethern, Fifth
Infantry; Captain E. G. Hunt. Fifth In
fantry; Captain H. T. Bennett, Fifth In
fantry; Captain E. A. Selfrldge, Signal
Corps; Captain D. A. Smith, Fifth Infan
try, Judge advocate.
The facts upon which the charges are
based are very simple, but they may in
volve the captain in very serious conse
quence. Orders were issued for the First
Infantry to parade on Admission day, and
there was a parade, but It was stated
that only eleven of the twelve companies
were in the regiment. It was ascertained
that Company F, Captain Nippert. was
the missing one. When the parade re
ports were returned It appeared that
Company F had paraded with forty-two
men and two officers. The matter was
turned over to Major James A. Margo
for investigation and from the report pre
sented It appeared that Company F (for
ty-two men and two officers) "was only a
paper parade and that instead of having
that number of men to help swell the
ranks of the regiment. Captain Nippert
had only about a dozen men at roll call
PROFESSORS WILL TALK
ON MUNICIPAL SUBJECTS
Merchants' Association Annual Din
ner Promises to Be an Event
in Local Circles.
The annual dinner of the. Merchants'
Association, to be held at the Palace Ho
tel on the 5th of next month, promises to
be a notable event ln the annals of tho
city. So many acceptances have already
beÂ«?n received that the attendance will un
doubtedly be very large. The subject for
discussion is one of great importance to
the municipality. The question of mu
nicipal ownership and operation of public
utilities must soon be decided by the citi
zens of San Francisco, and the Mer
chants' Association is desirous of securing
the benefit of the ripe Judgment and ob
servation of the best authorities upon
this question.
Professor K. C. Babcock of the Univer
sity of California, Colonel Henry Wein
stock. a prominent merchant of Califor
nia; Professor E. A. Ross, a well-known
authority upon governmental affairs, and
Frank J. Symmes, prominently known as
a student upon municipal questions, will
speak at this banquet. Both sides of thi
question will be discussed and the speak
ers will present arguments ln favor as
well as in opposition of municipal owner
ship and operation of public utilities.
President Dohrmann will give a brief re
view of municipal affairs ln connection
with the work of the association during
the past year.

FIRST APPEARANCE IN SAN FRANCISCO LAST NIGHT IN "LE3
HUGUENOTS" AT THE GRAND OPERA-HOUSE.
An eminent programme there is for to
day's entertainment. * "Lohengrin" this
afternoon with the same cast as last
week, with tne exception of Gadski a.Â«
Elsa, and "Faust" to-night, also with the
sam* cast, except for the substitution of
De Re^zke as the Mephisto in place of
Plancon.
M. Flon conducted last evening and the
orchestra and chorus did admirable work
under his direction. There are many
beautiful opportunities for the chorus In
"The Huguenots." The "Consecration of
the Swords" was a magnificent choral ef
fort. The whole splendid edifice of sound
builded upon the tuba's deep, broad Im
pulse below, the fine ecclesiastical manner
and air of it, the religious rhythm and
movement were heard with extraordinary
richness and dignity. The finale of tho
second act and the Huguenot-Catholic
chorus gave also much pleasure by their
rendering, and taken altogether, "The
Huguenots" may be counted In as one of
the most successful performances of the
season.
reserves to give to the climaxes, nor an
equal depth of feeling, but Ii fell so little
shortâ I am thinking of the big last scene
â that one almost prayed for the little
height unreached.
Seoul was a slashing Â«-onte dl Nevera.
He was in excellent voice, full of spirit,
life and fire, and scored a *Â»ne triumph in
this role so often scamped or indiuerently
rendered. Plancon â yes, and there i are
still others â was a superb Conto
dl San BriB. He was a fine old
Rembrandt grandee as to get-ui>,
and his imperious personality makes
him the center of every picture of which
he finds himself a part. He sang and
played the role with all the emphasis and
loruly dignity required and was a beauti
ful study in blacks to look upon.
It was a notable opportunity last night
to compare the two big bassos of the com
pany, for de Reszke sang the Marcel part.
Here's richness! Remembering his Lepo
rello of the other evening. It was almost
amurlng to hear De Rebzke masquerading
as the puritanical Huguenot soldier, but
his work was, of course, beyond criticism.
Still, I think there is a large leaning
toward comedy in De Iteszke, and, by the
way, his should be a magnificent Mephiato
to-night â another interesting comparison
with nis friendly rival, Plancon. The rest
of the cast, Bauermeister and Van Cau
teren. Bars, Hubbenet, Vlviani, Dufricha
and Maselro were all well heard.
James Whitcomb Riley has -written
for The Call a splendid Thanksgiving
poem. It will be published to-morrow.

"WASHINGTON, Nov. 23.â Mall advices
from Manila give In considerable detail
the story of the rescue of Captain Shields
and fifty men of the Twenty-ninth Infan
try after their capture by the insurgent'
in Marinduque.
The fifty men in question were pursuing
a party of Insurgents of superior force
into the mountains, when they were am
bushed in a box canyon by a force of 250
riflemen and 1800 bolomen. . They made a
continuous light for eight hours, killing:
a large number of the Insurgents, and
were overpowered only after they had
fired their last shot and practically. were
smothered In a hand-to-hand flght
with their 2000 adversaries. Sergeants
Williams and McCarthy, who were in
charge of some of the wounded, come in
for particular praise. They were cut off
from tho rest of the party during the re
treat and Intrenched themselves on the
hillside, where they stood off their assail
ants for about three hours, surrendering
after every cartridge had been exhausted.
Scarcely a man in the expedition es
caped being grazed or slightly wounded
during the right. The total number killed
was five. Captain Shields was wounded
'early in the fight, but continued. to direct
the operations of the rear guard during
four miles of retreat. He. finally was
knocked out by a bullet thrdugh the Jaw.
neck and shoulder, which was thought at
the time to be a fatal wound. The rescue
of -the party was effected by General

DEATH OF WELL

Senator W. A. Clark of Montana, ac
companied by> his son, J. Ross Clark, ar
rived in this city last evening from Salt
Lake City, where they had been since
Tuesday perfecting the of
the new Salt Lake and Los Angeles Rail
road Company. The Senator attended the
grand opera last evening and to-day he
will go to Los Angeles on matters pertain
ing to the new road.
Senator Clark is enthusiastic over the
prospects of an early realization of his
new railroad scheme. "We have com
pleted organization and are now prepar
ing for some hard, telling work," he said
at the hotel last evening. "There isn't a
great deal to say outside of what has al
ready been published. We are deter
mined to rush the construction of the
road as rapidly as possible, and will call
for proposals for our equipment immedi
ately. We have not yet ordered any ma
terial, but expect to shortly.
"The surveying has been completed as
far as San Bernardino, and the road be
tween there and Los Angeles will be built
first. The entire road, when completed,
will be 1100 miles long and will absorb the
Los Angeles Terminal, wh ] c J} rt J Â» fiS? u S
fifty miles long. Upward of $10,000,000 of
the $25,000,000 capital stock . has already
been paid in." .
Senator Clark said he could not tell
when the new line would be in operation.
It is the Intention, however, to push the
work as soon as the contract Is awarded.
It is probable the work will be carried on
from each end of the proposed line, as
this plan will permit of a much larger
force being employed.

And as to the men. Even those who
had admired most heartily Mr. Dippel's
work from what has been seen of it be
fore last night were hardly prepared for
the power and worth of his Raoul dl
Nangis. Not that the tenor scaled equal
heights with Nordlca, he has not the laM.
Suzane Adams made her first appear
ance here last night, of course as Mar
gherita di Valois, and created a most
favorable impression. She is a queenly
damsel, this girl, has a flexible, penetrat
ing, even brilliant soprano, and a gen
erous temperament. With years and ex
perience, as she gains authority and re
pose, added to her already considerable
distinction, one may safely prophesy very
large things for Miss Adams. She showed
a little not unbecoming nervousness to be
gin with, but it soon wore off and left her
free to use her fine voice to the best ad
vantage. Her coloratura work Is particu
larly good.
Rosa Olitzka sang the attractive page
role and did herself proud in the part,
her rich, liquid note finding a grateful
opportunity in the pretty and effective
muFic.
It was Nordica's night last night. Her
Valentlna was acted and sung with a
power that carried everything before it.
i-assionate, pathetic, dignified, tender
womanly, she was in the role, and the
audience held Its breath to her last note
at her pleading with Raoul to save him
self. Her voice was at its sweetest, and
rang out royally in the ensembles and
climaxes. It is a picture and a song that
will last as long as memory shall last,
full of genius, truth and inspiration.
till a quarter of twelve o'clock
did the final curtain ring down, but boats,
trains, cars and the difference in the
morning were all forgotten in the wonder
ful last act, given with a genius of in
spiration that has not been surpassed by

President Charles Nelson of the Cham
ber of Commerce will call to the atten
tion of the trustees of that body the Invi
tation v of Governor Candler of Georgia to
all who feel an Interest in the maritime
greatness of the United States to be repre
sented at a maritime congress to be held
in Brunswick, Ga., beginning on January
30. The call for the congress was issued
by Governor Candler a few days ago.
The natural supposition Is that all large
mercantile bodies in the United States,
and especially those of the seaboard cities,
will receive epecial invitations to send
delegates to the congress. President Nel-
Bon will wait a few days for the invita
tion before he will take any action. He
may call a meeting of the Chamber of
Commerce, but he thought yesterday that
the trustees might be the first to consider
the matter or being represented.
President Kelson has given the subject
of encouraging the building of American
ships much favorable attention. Two years
ago he talked with President McKinley.
Senator Hanna and others connected with
the naMonal Government about a ship
subsidy. He found that President McKln
ley was strongly in favor of that proposi
tion. Subsequently he heard President Mc-
Kinley speak at a banquet in Milwaukee,
and on that occasion such encouragement
was strongly urged. President McKinley
has often made public his views on the
necessity of having a fleet of American
vessels sufficient to carry American com-
m pres'ldent Nelson Fays there is no ques
tion that it would be a good thing to have
the great commercial port of San Fran
cisco represented. Indeed the Chamber of
Commerce has taken occasion in the past f
to have the ship subsidy matter brought
before the Trans-Mississippi Congress by
Congressman Kahn, who was delegated to
speak for the 'Chamber.
The only obstacle President iselson*
found in the way of sending delegates to

Joseph Malforite, proprietor of Delmon

and Mrs. Pronk occupying a suite at~hl3
place. Mrs. Pronk. he- paid, was in con

to administer to all of his wants. Mal
fonte's testimony . closed the day's pro

It was a. detailed statement of Potter's
last whirl around the tenderloin. It set
forth that Potter first met Mrs. Pronk at
the Ellis-street house kept by Oljra Evans:
that he remained there five days and when
not in bed was exhibiting his night
clothes from the easy depths of a rocking
chair. It told of how Potter, was enter

how the wine flowed: In fact, was a de

would not baye another," said Dr. Noble,
"and she gave him all the attention he

in answer to a question Dr. \ Xoble said
that he knew Charles C Boynton, who
was associated with the defense; that
Boynton had come to him and presented
a statement for his signature. At this
point attorneys for the defense objected to
Dr. Noble further testifying, which caused
Campbell to open Ws attack.
"We will prove." he said, ."that this man

A Retrial Ordered.
A r.ew trial was ordered by the Supreme
Court yesterday in the case of Mrs. Mary
Wales against the Pacific Electric Motor
Company. The plaintiff recovered dam
ages from the corporation for the death
of her son. and but lor the error of the
trtai Judge in charging the jury, she
might now be in possession of monetary
compensation for the loss of her sons
tujiport. Young Wales was engaged in
tainting s. house and in moving a wire re
ceived a shock and was hurled to the
ground, receiving Injuries from which he
afterward died. In rendering its deci
sion the court stated that the evidence
was an?> to support the verdict and said
it was unfortunate that the giving of cer
tain instructions to the jury constituted
error which demanded the retrial "of the
case.
! every seat In the courtroom was taken. A
i number of women were present, mostly
of the dizzy blonde type. The defendant,
neatly dressed and wearing a veil, sat by
the Elde of her attorney, Joseph Roth
erhiM. Lund was not present. The case
of the people was repret "ited by Prose
cuting Attorney Hanley and J..J. Roach
of Sullivan & Sullivan,' Lund's attorneys.
Rothschild said that while his client, the
defendant, had asked that the hearing be
i public, he had learned that the testimony
! to be Introduced would be of a nature to
lead to other civil and criminal actions and
! would work to the injury of Innocent per-
I sons In no way connected with the case,
1 but related by ties of blood to persons in-
I volved in the case. Therefore he had de
; cided to join the prosecution in asking
] that the hearing be behind closed doors.
Judge Cabaniss eaid he would consent
Â¦ to exclude the morbidly curious, who
! were there in hope of hearing salacious
details, but he would not exclude the rep
resentatives of the press, as euch action
would result only in the publication of
garbled accounts of the testimony. His
order was issued accordingly, and the
room was- cleared of all but court at
taches, counsel and reporters.
Three witnesses were examined during
the session. Samuel J. Levy, -formexly
night watchman at the Franklin Hotel,
where it is alleged that Mrs. Lund and
Harry Herz lived together as Mr. and
Mre. Jerome, was the first witness. He
knew very little and told what he did
know so poorly that the prosecution
gained practically nothing from his testi
mony. Mrs. Jennet Petersen of Berkeley,
the wife of O. \V. Petersen. master of
the schooner Zampa. and Mrs. Marguerite
Martinez, residing at the corner of Par
cific and Mason streets, were the star
witnesses. They had spied upon Mrs.
Lund and Herz. ever, to watching at the
keyhole of Mrs. Lund's bedroom in the
Franklin Hotel.
Mrs. Petersen furnished the sensation
of the session. She began her testimony
with an a!r of virtue offended, but told
unblufhlnrly ot watching at the keyhole
of Mrs. Lund's room. With a. little urg
ing at the beginning she gave her testi
mony freely, always with the air of a
wife and mother who felt outraged by
what she had teen and what she had
: learned of the other woman's character.
: Then Rothschild took her in hand for
[ cross-exair.iration and succeeded in draw
â¢ ing from her the acknowledgment that
- while ehe had lived for some years in
: Berkelev as the wife of a respectable sea
Â¦ captain, during that time at periods when
! her husband was at sea ?he had worked
; under the name of Jes?ie Lee as barmaid
i and waitress in various Barbary Coast
I dives, and that during the past nine
Â¦ years, until six weeks ago. she had kept
: a room on the Barbary Coast, though
but the inevitable picture hat was there.
Samuel J. Levy, now of 1202 Mission
street, testified that till November 17 he
had been night watchman at the Franklin
Hotel, at the junction of Market and
Page streets. His duty was to go on
watch at 11 o'clock and during the night
to rent rooms, run the elevator and an
swer calls.
The attorneys had a long squabble as to
the character of the testimony that could
be introduced. Rothschild contended that
only evidence tending- to prove open and
notorious relations between the defend
ant and Harry Herz. as alleged In the
complaint, could be put on record. Roach
contended that the proving of instances
of infidelity was the only way in which
open and notorious relations could be
proved. He said the prosecution, if given
a chance, would prove that defendant and
Herz had lived together as husband and
wife. Judge Cahaniss ruled to permit
Roach to proceed with his line of ques
tioning, the court reserving the right to
strike out the testimony later in the
hearing.
Witness Levy, who Is middle-aged and
who showed a tendency to owl-like stupid
ity, due probably to his long vigils at
night in the little office of the Franklin
Hotel, said that defendant had lived at
the hotel under the name of Jeffries. Then
he took it back and said the name bejjan
with "J." Being prompted by Roach,
with the court's permission, he remem
bered it was Jerome. She had been in the
hotel five or six weeks, at first for two
weeks In rooms 3 and 4, and afterward
upstairs In rooms IS and 19.
Witness had seen Herz with defendant
and on various occasions had seen him go
with her to her rooms. He had supposed
he was her husband and that his name
was Jerome. They weal to the rooms to
gether before midnight on the night of
Wednesday. November 14. and witness
saw Herz leave the next morning: about
6 o'clock. He had been in the rooms sev
eral times when Herz was there, once
when he rang for ice-water and he went
to take it up to them.
On cross-examination witness said ne
had "asked for his time" last Saturday
after some words with his employer. Hs
testified that Herz did not live in the hotel
In the sense that other guests lived there.
Mrs. Petersen was called to the stand.
She said that she had met defendant
about five years ago at Guaymas, Mexico,
while defendant was still Miss Forman.
housekeeper for Lund, whom she marriel
soon after. She told of ?oing to the Frank
lin Hotel on the evening of Wednesday,
November 14, to rooms 26 ana 27, taken by
Mrs. Martinez. She and Mrs. Martinez
knew when defendant and Herz came In.
at nearly midnight, and she saw them to
gether in Mrs. Lund's rooms.' And wit
ness drew herself up with an air x>f con
scious virtue. She admitted she waj
watching at the keyhole end heard Herz
say something about sending a cape back.
Mrs. Lund had replied. "Oh-we will maks
the old fool pay for it." Then she told
how the defendant had posed and had
said. "Am I not pretty?" and Herz hail
replied, "Yes, my darling; you are fair
and beautiful."
That same incident was described later
in broken English by Mrs. Martinez. Ac
cording to her the defendant said. "Ain t
I purty?" and Herz's reply was, "Yea, my
dear; you air."* . ' , Â¦
Mrs. Petersen said that she and Mrs.
Martinez had remained ; up till 3 or 4
â¢o'clock and were sure Herz did not leave
the rooms during that time. Thursday
evening she had seen Herz lying on the
bed in Mrs. Lund's room, but Mrs. Lund
was not in at the time. Sunday morning
she had seen them come in together at I
or 3 o'clock, but Herz left, saying hi
would come back If he "did not see thai
man."
Roths-child began the cross-examination
and started In at once to ret at the char
acter of the witness. Her husband had
gone to sea yesterday. She was known m
San Francisco sometimes as Mrs. Maher.
as her first husband's name was Fernando
Maher. They had conducted "a saloon at
433 Pacific street, which they sold in 1SW
Afterward she had tended bar for Peter
Anderson at Pacific street and Montgom
ery avenue, where "women J were em
ployed on percentag-e." Then for a tim*
she worked as other girls did, as a wait
ress. She had been a waitress also at the
saloon at 51S Pacific street, for a man
named Llndbom. She was ..nown as Jes
sie Lee, and in the good n.utical fashion
the saloon was called the "Jessie Lee.''
These later experiences were after her
marriage to Petersen, but she declined to
say whether he knew of them. She admit
ted having had a room at 51S Pacific street
for nine years past, but would not say
how often she had occupied It. -She de
nied that she had lived there with an
Italian named Pete Parini.
This lone recital with its thrust and
parry between counsel and witness told
on Mrs. Lund's nerves, and at the time
when the witness was worst tortured by
Rothschild the defendant hid her face and
sobbed.
Mrs. Petersen denied that she had been
offered reward by Lund if she should te
cure evidence for him. She said she had
gone to the hotel as Mre. Lund's friend.
hoping to Induce her to return to her
home, the residence- on Webster street
but that she had turned against her after
what she saw that flrat night. She could
not explain why she had stayed at the
hotel till Sunday morning, after Mr3.
Lund's arrest, because, as she said. "I
am on oath and I cannot tell positively
If I am telling the truth."
Mrs. Martinez told briefly . of taklnr
turns at the keyhole with Mrs. Petersen.
She was very frankly a Barbary Coaster,
givlnsr evidence that she had been em
ployed to pet and to give, and what slit;
saw was told with as much dlrectnes$ as
her poor command of English would per
mit. Â«i.Her. cross-examination went over
until Monday at 2 p. m_. when the hear
ing will be continued.

I criminal charge brought 'against
I Mrs. William C. Lund, the young
Jl wife of the aged capitalist, as
counter to her suit for divorce on
the- ground of cruelty, began yesterday
before Police Judge Cabanlss. The ex
amination of witnesses did not proceed
very fax. but It went far enough to "show
that each side has been liberal In employ-
Ing private detectives to gather evidence
damaging to the other side.
At Mrs. Lund's request, the hearing
was to have been public, and at 2 o'clock
having a home Jn Berkeley, where her son
and ' daughter, the former 16 years old,
lived. She refused to say whether her
husband knew these facts or not.
Mrs. Petersen Is a woman of middle age,
quite stout, and of florid complexion. She
wore a black silk dress, black gloves and
a picture hat that added a foot and a
half to her short stature. She used her
words with studied accuracy, and showed
herself pugnacious repeatedly when
forced to unpleasant disclosures by Roth
schild's questions.
Mrs. Martinez was different. She was
frankly and confessedly, from the Bar
bary Coast and she looked the part. She
was not so richly dressed as Mrs. Pet ?f3en.

If the Secretary of State Had In
vited Bids Price Charged 'Â¦):
Would Have Been Much
XfOwtr.
.'Â¦Â¦" â¢ '.
Two Interesting matters developed at
the investigation yesterday, by the Super
visors* Judiciary Committee of the May
or's veto of the dcmancT for J725 filed
by the Secretary of State " for bal
lot paper used in .the last election. Tha
first admission made by several paper
dealers was that an unusual profit wa3
made on a special order for ballot* paper.
This was also borne out by the testimony
of Registrar "Walsh,' who stated that A.;
Zelierbach. who had charged 12*Â£ cents'
per pound for the paper, had later offered
the same to Walsh for 10 cents per pound.
A^ain. Walsh testified that Blake. Mof
fltt & Towne had told him that it was ut
terly useless to enter into competition'ln
Sacramento to supply the ballot paper, as
their dimples had often been returned un
opened. In other words,, so strong was
the influence of other firms that it would
not go to -the trouble to; submit competi
tive bids, knowing that it stood no chance
to obtain the contract.
There' were present at the meeting Su
pervisors Brandensteln. Cornte and Tobin
of the committee. Assistant Secretary
Hoesch explained how the paper had been
bought and appeared much hurt that the
demand was not paid Immediately and
without an investigation of Its exorbitant
figure. He was asked pointed . questions
as to why no -competitive bids had been
Invited and whether he did not think that
a lower price could have been secured In
competition. .
"The . only mistake I . made," said
Hoesch, "was not to have exacted pay
ment for the paper in advance, but I
thought the city of San Francisco -was
able to pay its bills. In 1S98 the city paid
$1395, in IMS $1096. an'd in 1900 $725 for. the
ballot paper. The price has ranged from
$2 3) a ream to $3 SO in years past, while
we have charged you only 12 50 a ream."
"Don't you think you should only
charge the actual market value of the
paper?" asked Comte. "Because you paid
twice as much as the paper is alleged to
be worth is no reason why the city should
have to stand the difference. The law is
very clear that the market value only
should obtain in a matter of this kind."
Hoesch thereupon was sworn and testi
fied that he purchased the paper for 52 50
a ream.
"Did you advertise for bids?" asked
Comte.
"Xo," replied Hoesch, "we bought It
from A. Zelierbach & Co., with whom we
entered into a contract."
"Did the Secretary of State negotiate
with any other firms for th-3 purchase of
the paper?" asked Brandenstein.
"No, sir." replied Hoesch.
"Isn't it customary to advertise for
bids?"
"Xo," said Hoesch. 'it Is not customary.
The fact that secrecy is. required would
prevent that."
Brandenstein wanted to know what pro
tection the county had against exorbitant
charges that might be made by the Sec
retary.
"We appear to be at the mercy of the
Secretary of State," said Brandenstein.
"Well," said Hoesch, "you would have
to depend on the honesty of the Secre
tary."
I. Zelierbach. who made the sale of the
ballot paper to the Secretary of State,
testified as follows:
"The price charged at the time the con
tract was entered into was a fair market
value. The restriction thrown around the
purchase of the ballot paper, such as se
crecy, water mark and the opaque char
acter required, necessitated great care and
caused trouble. The paper was sold by
the ream, which would make it between
11 'and 12 cents per pound. The way in
which the lower price of 5 cents was quo
ted to Registrar Walsh was on the sub
mission of a small sample without the
water mark. Xo one can place a value on
paper In that way and come within 5
or 6 cents a pound of the actual value.
The market was unsettled at the time the
order was filled. The profit on the order
was from 20 to 25 per cent greater than
our usual profit."
Tobin asked Zelierbach what his usual
profit was. but he refused to tell in detail.
"Sometimes we only make 2 per cent."
said Zelierbach. who seemed anxious to
dismiss the subject.
C. L. Bonestell. who quoted 5 cents per
pound on the same paper for which Zeli
erbach charged 12>4 cents, testified that
his quotation? had no bearing on what the
price might have been when , Zelierbach
sold the paper.
"There were great difficulties In filling
orders when the ballot paper was srUd
last January," said Bonestell. "My price
would make the cost about $125 per ream.
There Is no market value In a special con
tract of that kind. Different firms have
different ideas of placing valuations on
the cost of the. product."
"If there was competition," said Comte,
"the price would be less, vfould it not?"
"Yes, it certainly would," said Bone
stell.
John Curtis, paper expert of Payot. TJp
ham & Co., thought that the price of $2 50
per ream was reasonable, considering the
circumstances surrounding the purchase
of the paper, but Curtis acknowledged
that he did not know the value of paper
last January.
James Taylor, an agent of a paper com
pany which made some of the paper for
Zelierbach. testified that no paper mill
cares to make ballot paper with all the
exactions required, as It entailed consid
erable trouble.
"I would not consider the proposition at
10 cents a pound." said Taylor.
Registrar Walsh took exception to a
statement made by Hoesch that the paper
had been hawked about.
"I did not take a smal: piece of paper
for a sample, as has been alleged." said
Walsh, "but a whole ballot blank, with
the water mark, i This I did ten days after
election dny, so that the secrecy required
by law was not violated. I learned that
the city was being charged at the rate of
one-half a cent a ballot, and I thought
it expensive, and I have been borne out
by the letters of Blake. Moffltt & Towne
and C. L. Bonestell, who quoted the lower
figure. I have no prejudice In this matter,
but I deemed it my duty to make an in
vestigation. I informed Mr. Zelierbach
that I thought the price was exorbitant.
" 'Weil, you'll have to pay it.' said Zell
erbach. 'Even if the Secretary of State
would charge you 25 cents, you would
have to pay it. I will sell you the paper
now for 10 cents Â«: pound.* -
"This rate was 25 per cent less than that
charged by the Secretary of State. I
thought there must oe a big profit
In paper. Blake, Moffltt & Towr.e in
formedâme--that ."there Â¦was *no use
to enter Into competition at Sacra
mento With other: firms who appeared to
have the inside track, as its samples had
often been returned unopened. The firm
also informed me that the â¢ paper was
made of wood pulp and was only common
newspaper that had been sized. If It was
given time It would quote 4H cents 1 to fill
the order In carload lots."
At this point the Investigation was. post
poned to obtain more evidence as to what
was the actual market price of the paper
at. the time it was purchased.

SENSIBLE TEMPERANCE
A Word to Temperance Ladies.
It is universally admitted that temper- :
*.r.ce women work for their cause with a
cesire tc make life happier; that Is, In- !
temperance In drinlc causes an immens-e
snsouit of niisery la human life, and the
temperance movement is an effort to re-
p'.a.ce Una nJecry with happiness, peace
sr.d conifort.
llary temperance women make the mis-
take of roing at the subject hammer and
tor.g* and proposing to force people to be-
lieve their xi-av. It Is far better to exer-
cise a bread charity ana take the position
that cne'i own peace of mind and happi-
r.ess, r.ot only cf the individual but of Iho
family and friende. depends upon sensi-
ble habits of life.
A very much greater foe to human bap-
pfr.ets than whisky exists, and it will
ftartle many an honest temperance work-
er when the name of that foe is given.
It Is spelled c-o-f-f-e-e. "I don't believe
Jt." some ardent temperance worker says,
who is really a slave herself to the coffee
cup.
Cast your thougrht among 1 your elck
friends, ccrvous, irritable, broken down
women whose- homes are anything but
peaceful hones because of the irritation
end friction brought about by their physi-
cal and mental condition. In ninety-fivÂ«
case* out of a hundred, the nervousness,
irritability, dyspepsia, kidney trouble, fe-
male troubles, and various diseases which
fjch people are subject to, come directly
from a. broken down nervous system,
brought about by the dally use of coffee.
<\'areful chemical analyst* prove* this
ttatement to fce absolutely true and per-
soral experiment will prove the same to
any one who cares to make It.
Vou may have a few friends who are
Trade miserable by whisky, but yqu have
i^ires of friends whost lives are made
miserable, as well as the lives of their
families, by the use of coffee. Hard to

Indicate the presence of public participation
in speculation and of enormous Investment pur
chases. Is the principal feature in the stock
market. The tone has generally been strong,
but the market has had intervals of irregular
ity and has also shown at times a reactionary
tendency. This last -was due' mainly to profit
taking, though some renewal of short sales by
professional operators was noted. The action
of the' money market in view of the remark
able advances that have accompanied the phe
nomenal activity Is regarded as a point in fa
vor of the bulls, and with trading at New York
Stock Kxchange practically exceeding one mil
lion a day for the entire period since the elec
tion, there Is no symptom of pressure In the
money market. Some hesitancy about accept
ing industrials as collateral for loans Is noted,
but call money has not risen above 4V4 or 5
per cent, but 4 per cent or less neema to have
been the rates at which accommodation to
carry standard stocks could be obtained. The
fact that the item of loans In last Saturday's
bank statement increased only some J2 000 000
was at first regarded with surprise, but the
explanation offered for lt is that a great pro
portion of the purchases of stocks and bonds
made by commission houses are In tha nature
of Investments, the securities being paid for
and taken out of the loan market.. This process
brought money to New York and at the same
time reduces the volume of outstanding loans
to an extent which largely offsets the Increased
speculative borrowings. Europe has to some
extent been a buyer of stocks at concessions
this week, probably to meet calls on Americans
put out In London prior to the election The
effect of this, however, has not overcome the
previous larg. foreign sales, which have been
sufficient to hold up foreign exchange rates at
a level considerably above the gold Importing
point. The confidence of our own public in the
financial and business situation is, however so
general and marked that Europe's position con
tinues to be regarded with indifference and In
the purchasing power which asserts Itself at all
concessions or reactions the street finds the best
Indication that the bull movement In prices is
not exhausted. .
NEW YO^K,.Nov. 23.â Bradstreef s Financial
Review to-morrow Trill say:
CHICAGO. Nov. 23.â It was a quiet day in
the wheat pit. The news had in lt nothing
which could be twisted by bulls Into a rny of
hope and liquidation continued with scarcely
any Interruption until near the end of the
session. Liverpool closed %@Vid lowÂ«r In the
face of steadiness here yesterday and Argen
tine shipments, according- to Board of Trade
figures, were 736,000 bushels, compared with
264,000 bushels the week pre7ious and 660,000
bushels the corresponding week a year ago.
December opened H@%c to Â»i@T4c lowe;- at
7O'K'S7O%c. and declined during the forenoon to
70<S70Hc. The market steadied and later under
moderate cash demand and a prediction that
the visible would show a decrease Monday the
market reacted and closed steady, %c under
yesterday at 70H@70%c.*
Corn was quiet and easy, the legitimate fac
tors being srood weather and a prospect of in
creased 1 country offerings. It was chiefly a
scalping: market. December cloied He lower at
S5%c George .H. Phillips, who controls the
November corn option, was doing nothing to
day and In consequence deals l.\ the cornered

shade lower at 21?4c

NEW TOPJT, Nov. 23.â The slump In Wire
and Steel cf 4VÂ» Just at the close of trading last
evening was universally regarded as a danger
Eign. The epeculative public came down to
Wall street in a mood receptive to depression
and reaction. Tfce first suggestion came in the
form of a further break of 3 points In Steel and
Wire. Apparently no more effective point could
have been selected at which to attack the mar
ket. This was known from previous experiences
Â¦with tl-.is particular etock. The iron and steel
trades are supposed to have had most to hope,
&ad in fact actually to have enjoyed most of
the benefits of the revival cf business and in
dustry. The sudden weakness of Steel and
Wire did not raif>e any doubts of the reports
heretofore ac<as>ted cf the prosperous conditions
In that tra.(le and the excellent prospects for
the future, but it did arouse serious apprehen
eion of a determination on the part of some of
the tteÂ«l macsates to enter ujÂ»on a course of
clashing competition and to unsettle the trade,
s.s they have already proved themselves abun
cantly able to do. The wide-reaching effect of
euch an attack of hostilities in the steel trade
may be measured by the degree of apprehen
sion exhibited by holders of long stock to-day.
The eteel Mocks themreiv^s were most imme
diately affected, but hÂ«*avy declines are shown

WHEATâ Liverpool was quiet and steady.
Paris was lower and New York declined lc.
Chicago was weak, as lower cables depressed
the market. Selling by commission houses was
heavy and London was also a heavy seller.
St. Louis likewise realized heavily. This week's
Argentine shipments were reported at 656,000
bushels, against Â£60,000 on the same week la&t
year. A San Francieco house cabled to Chi
cago: "Why does not wheat advance?" and
received the following answer: "Wheat does
not advance because stock is piling up all the
time. Bt. Louis. for example, has the
largest quantity In her history; the visible
supply of the world Is 8,000,000 bushels more
than at this time last year, and supplies afloat
and In store are more than liberal. This load
Is hard to lift until consumption overtakes
the supply at terminal points." This answer
tells the story of the current depression.
In this market futures were again off, but
shipping quotations remained unchanged.

The markets here were moderatf-Iy active and
the tone satisfactory till the afternoon, when
a French rumor that the Oar's condition was
serious, though not credited, affected the
speculative markets adversely. Americans
were much less Interesting than they have been
recently and business was 1 educed. There
was general profit-taking by London and the

Two factors militate strongly against activity
and strength in wool and woolens. Mild
weather has been the chief adverse lniuence,
reducing sales far below a normal volume in
this vicinity, while liquidation of embarrassed
concerns threatens to throw a conslderablÂ«
quantity on the market at forced sales. In the
light of these disquieting features It Is not sur
prising that sales of wool at the three chief
Eastern markets declined to 6.354.331 pounds,
against 8.3E2.000 pounds in the week preceding
and 19,870,392 pounds a year ago. Hides con
tinue to rise regardless of the largest arrivals
of cattle at Chicago in many years.
Failures for the week were 238 In the United
States, against 191 last year, and 29 In Canada,
against 22 last year.
With reasonable promptness business Is re
covering both activity and tone and fortunate
ly without the sharp rise, in general prices
which wÂ«3 seen In the Spring nnd which was
followed -by a Midden and serious translJon to
a more nntuial range. Manufactured goods nre
rising In response to a better demand from dis
tributing jjcuro^b helped at the end of the week
by the more seasonable weather. Business I*
not yet what :t was on the top of the wave
cf Industrial prosperity, but this working forts*
is faBt increasing-. The ordinary nwaiurfi of
business reflect operations at all points, but the
textile markets ore at the point of lrast re
sponse to the Improved undertone of trade.
Recital of conditions In the Iron and steel
market has become a monotonous repetition.
Each week there is the same record of activity
so generally distributed that everything from
the raw material to the ilnlshed product en-
Joys a share. There Is also the same freedom
from speculative accumulation In anticipation
ot fancy prices that has been for weeks the
roost encouraging feature. Railroad companies
compete for rolling stock. Export orders in
eorre lines are filled with difficulty, owing to
the, unusual domestic demand for all forms of
iron and steel product*, but In no quarter is
thele any unreasonable inflation of prices such
as was seen during the meteoric ascent last
year. In a few descriptions prices on export
orders are shadod to hold the business.

At the conclusion of the arguments
Judge Thayer announced that he would
taVe the rase under advisement and then
adiourned court. Carter was somewhat
disappointed, but afteÂ»- a short conference
with his attorney he returned to the Fed
eral prison to await the decision.
â¢'It Is time that this practice should
cease and all be given a civil trial," said
Blair. "If my client fs released he will
at once proceed to Savannah. Georgia; and
give himself to the civil authorities, con
fident that he will be vindicated."
Judge Thayer limited Carter's attor
neys to three hours, and the Government
to two and one-half, for argument. At
torney Hlalr openod for Carter, whose
conviction, he contended, was illegal. In
asmuch as it should have been secured
under the sixtieth article of war. Instead
of the sixty-second, and claimed that
when the President disapproved several
findings in'a court-martial the full sen
tence pronounced by the court-martial
ceased to exist, and its execution was Il
legal and void. He also argued that when
Carter paid a flie and was dismissed from
the army and degraded, the power of the
court-martial was exhausted and bore no
right to cause Imprisonment.
Carter showed slight nervousness as the
hearing proceeded. His eyes went quickly
from his attorney to Â«he Judges, and oc
casionally he took notes en the argument.
When court convened at 2 o'clock Colontl
Clous began the argument in behalf of tin;
Government.
In reply to Mr. Blair. Colonel Clous con
tended that he court-martial was compe
tent to decide under which charge the
prisoner should be tried and that Its de
cision was not subject to review by an
ther court. He further argued that the
conviction on four charges for the sam^j
act was not four convictions for one of
fensp. In his opinion Carter Is now he!d
a public prisoner of the United States ai
an offender against it<* laws, the court
martial retaining Jurisdiction for all pur
poses of trial. Judgment - ~nd execution.
The matter of the sentence st: nding un
changed In spite of the disapproval of
several of the specifications on which Car
ter was found guilty. Colonel Clous heid,
was In accordance wlih custom. Blair
made tne concluding plea for Carter. He
attacked the policy of the Government in
the practice of trylnjr members of the
army by court-martial. Blair said that "In
this case not the liberty of one man alone
is at stake, but the lives and liberty of
hundreds of others."
Frank P. Blair of Chicago and Con
gressman Grosvenor of Ohio appeared for
carter, while Colonel J. W. Clous, Dep
uty Judge Advocate of the array, and
District Attorney I. E. Lambert and his
assistant. H. E. Bone, represented the
Government. D. S. Carter of Illinois, an
uncle of the prisoner, was in the au
dience.
Carter was brought from the prison to
the courtroom in an ambulance, unat
tended save by Warden McCIaughey. He
appeared pelf possessed as he took his
seat, and avoided the gaze of tho spec
tators who crowded the room. The ex
captain was attired In a new black suit,
which the warden had, at the prisoner's
earnest solicitation, permitted him to
substitute for his prison garb. His hair
and mustache were much grayer than
when he began to serve his term. His
face was wan.

cause why Warden . .cClaughey of the

prisoner, were opened in the United

CARTER'S FIGHT
FOR FREEDOM
NO SOCIAL DISTINCTIONS
AT STATE UNIVERSITY
there are. no weak ones In Its bond, but
because no one is overlooked and de
spised because he Is feeble, and because
all are united by the common hearthstone
ard in the mother's love. The university
Is democratic, because there Is with
in it no diversity of talents and of worth,
but because all are Judged by higher
standards than those of blood or birth or
influence, because every man has a man's
chance and ell are united in Ideal loyalty
to real truth.
"I may be speaking to no present need,
but if there be any of you who have been
led astray Into the service of the false
gods of social distinctions. I abjure you
!n the name of the academic faith that
you forsake your sins and return to the
altars of Athena. I^et the university be
what it is set to be, the home of the In
tellectual democracy. Do not bring In
here and do not suffer any one to brine
In here any ghostly similitudes of thos<?
distinctions which divide people In the
outer world according to prejudice of
family, riches, race and occupation.
"If you are looking for a friend who
will be of some service to you in future
life do not select that friend because of
the cut of his clothes or the amount ol
his wealth or the pride of his family
name. Select rather the worker, the
'grind,' the 'dig.' Seiect those who will
be the future first families. If they are
not from the first families now. The man
who Is able to make his body work when
It doesn't want to has indeed a erreat
blessing. He is the man to seek for
friendship, for he is the coming man. Do
not believe that belonging to any fra
ternity or society or other college organi
zation make* one man better than an
other. A man who does not belong to a
fraternity Is no better than one who does,
neither Is one who belongs any better
than one who does not. Do not tolerate
In yourself, do not recognize In others an
arbitrary self-rating according to unreal
tests such as family connections, mem
bership In particular bodies and worldly
possessions. This Is a dace where
"handsome 1Â« as handsome does' "
President Wheeler's address was listen
ed to with great attention by the mem
bers of the student body and faculty and
when he closed the big gymnasium was
shaken with applause.
President Wheeler Says a Student Is No
More a Man Because of Wealth.
PRESIDENT WHEELER'S STRONG WORDS.
A university is a place that rightfully knows no aristocracy
as between studies, no aristocracy as between scientific truths, and
no aristocracy as between persons. . . The university is dem
ocratic, not because there is within it no diversity of telents and
of wcrth, but because all are judged by higher standards than those
of blood or birth or influence, because every man has a man's chance,
and all are united in ideal loyalty to real truth. I may be speaking
to no present ne^d, but if there be any of you who have been led
astray with the false gods of social distinctions, I abjure you in the
rane of the academic faith thatycu forsake your sins and return to
the altars of Athena. ... If you are looking for a friend who
will be of some service to you in future life do not neglect that
friend because of the cut of his clothes or the amount of his wealth
or pride of his family name. Select rather the worker, the "grind,"
the "dig." Select those who will bo the future first families if they
are not from the first families now.
Tfâ^ EUKELET. Nov. 23.â The t. T ni-
= sJ vcrslty of California is a demo
}\ cratic institution, where gocial
iLâ 4/ distinctions cannot exist. So
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler
tcid the students at the university meet
ing this morning In the gymnasium. He
told them also that the latest cut in
clothing did not signify thai a real man
wore It-
He advised the students who were
looking for friends who would be of
xise to them to go to the college work
ers â the college * 4 grinds"; to go to
those who will be the future men and
not to those now prominent through
name, cr money, or position, only.
Alden Anderson, a Regent of the Uni
versity and Speaker of the Assembly, alÂ«o
addressed the students. He cpoke In an
interesting manner on "Arbitration,"
Tiiih particular reference to the settle
ment of Etrtkee through that means. Mr.
Anderson was Introduced by President
Wheeler and said In part:
'Like all the fruits of progress, arbi
tration has been elow of growth. Edu
cation, among the masses is what is need
ed now to bring them to a. full realization
of its posEiblitica.
"There Is a tendency toward co-opera
tion in all walks of life to-day. There is
irore capital put together and more la
boring men banded together than ever
tÂ»efcre known in the history of the world.
The questions in dispute which arise be
tween these great forces of capital and
labor thould be settled by arbitration.
The people should be educated to the
point where they would demand arbitra
tion In strikes the general public is the
jrreatest sufferer and public opinion
f-hould force arbitration on the disputants.
"At this time public opinion would not
Indorse compulsory arbitration law*, but
that Is a matter solely of education."
After Regent Anderson's address Presi
dent Wheeler spoke to the students, say
irg in part:

Public.
SAYS ALASKA
NEEDS NEW LAWS
In my last annual message to the Legisla
ture I recommended the adoption of a system
which would secure a reasonable publicity of
such facts concerning corporations as the pub
lic has a rlgnt to know and reasonable re
strictions of their powers. Events have shown,
especially In view of what has occurred in con
nection with the Ice' trust, that stronger action
than what I recommended should be taken.
Not only should such provisions concerning
corporations as above mentioned be enacted
Into law, but there should be lodged soThe
where the power to prescribe the conditions
under which foreign and 'domestic corporations
can do business In this State and to deprive
them of their charters if they at any time
violate these conditions.
There has not been an hour's unnecessary
delay on the part of the State authorities.
Fifty-sjx days elapsed from June 2, when the
World first made its charges, until July 27.
when its amended complaint put those charges
In final form, and forty-two days elapsed
from Awrust 17. when those charges were
served upon the Mayor, uirtl September 27.
when the Mayor filed his answer. Th* delay
since then has been solely due to the fact that
the World at that time discharged the coun
sel which it formerly employed, and refused
to ro on with the case, leaving it completely
tn the air for the time being.
Although the matter of trusts Is not directly
Involved In this decision. I wish to point out
that the existing law of the State, even pro
vided that under it the Attorney funeral's
action against the Ice. corporation should be
successful. Is not adequate. .
In giving his decision the Governor said:
I concur In the Attorney General's oplnfon.
My Judgment Is that the so-called Ice trust la
.not a corporation In which the Mayor of N>w
York should have stock. But no proof has
been offered of any willful violation of law on
the part of the Mayor such as would Justify
the drastic measure of removing him from of
fice. The power of removal from office of
elective officers should be treated much as we
treat the power of Impeachment. It Is an ex
traordinary and not an ordinary remedy.
The normal remedy for bad government must
be an appeal to the people, and only In wholly
exceptional cases Is it dÂ«Â«strable to substitute
for this appeal to the people an appeal to the
power of removal or the power. of impeach
ment. The case Is. therefore, dismissed.
There Is, therefore, as stated by the Attorney
General in his letter of November 23 little to
add to what was contained In his letter of Oc
tober 4.
The brief presented by Mr. Hayes of counsel
to the World, undated, but received In this
office November 20, contains no additional tes
timony or Indication where additional testi
mony can be obtained. The situation Is there
fore unchanged from what It was on October
4. 1900, when the Attorney General wrote his
ALBANY, N. T., Nov. 23.â Governor
Roosevelt to-night gave out his decision
for the application for removal from of
fice of Mayor Robert Van Wyck of. New-
York City. He declines to remove the
Mayor on the ground that while he was
undoubtedly a stockholder in the Ameri
can Ice Company, there has been no proof
that he willfully violated the law forbid
ding a public officer to be a stockholder In
a corporation having dealings with his
municipality.
The Governor's memorandum says:
Governor Roosevelt Refuses
to Remove the
Mayor.

I heard Gray say to the Judges he wanted the
cases dismissed.
In the case of Michael Fleming. Gray told the
defendant to swear when he went on the stand
that the horse was not lame that morning when
he took him out when he was arrested. He so
Â¦were, at the same time telling me on -the day
he was arrested that the horse had been laid
up for a week on account cf lameness.
On June 22, 1899. after Marshall and White
Â¦were tried in Department 2. Gray went to
Captain Wright, at that time the Chief of Po

W. T. Hooper. Captain Wright sent for the
officer and told him to go a little slow In the
Gray cases.
The report further states that John Con

The usual incidents of campaism work
were many and interesting; they were
sometimes most wearisome, but the grand
results make every burden insignificant.
Utah's three electoral votes were not
needed In the prand asrKresrate of the peo
ple's vote of confidence in the principles
and policies of the Republican party and
of its great leader. William McKinley,

tors are to be elected, is a great gain for
sound politics and good government.
ences obscured the real outlines of Re
publicanism and Democracy. The State is
coming to know its own mind, and that
mind is clearly Republican.
The exclusion of Brigham H. Roberts
at the last session of Congress and the
opening ui> of the whole question of
polygamy was not influential as a factor
in the campaign. Mr. Roberts is respect
ed as a religious writer, but "Mormons"â
Republicans and Democratsâ regret that
his personal political ambitions were the
occasion of bringing the peculiar Institu
tion of the Mormon religion before the in
spection and the renewed and emphatic
condemnation of the American people.
The Institution of plural marriages Is now
done away with by the law of the land
and the 'manifesto" of the church. Its
ramifications In the family, social, eco
nomic and political life of the people are
still plainly seen, but the roots are killed
and the tree must die.
Hies. It is true that the Church of Latter
T'ay Saints teaches not only a unique and
most peculiar system of religious faith,
but It holds and teaches and works out a
clearly defined policy concerning material
things in the life which now is. This ma
terial side of the Mormon faith is. within
the limits of its operation, identical with
the broad and national policy of the Re
publican party. It is the general policy
of protection to the Industries of the peo
ple and the preservation of the home
market by tariffs and bounties. Brlgham
Young, their great leader, was a wise and
farseelng economist; his policy for Utah
and for Mormon settlers everywhere was
a clearly defined policy of protection.
Also, as Is well known. Mormon mis
sionaries go to the ends of the earth to
gather adherents to their faith and pil
grims to this country, which Is their Zlon.
These proselytes and pilgrims know that
in the United States, under the homestead
laws, a man may possess land and may
gather about him and his family the per
manent comforts and advantages of a
stake in the soil, which !s impossible in
ary other country. When, therefore. It
is explained to the Mormon voter â as I
took great care to doâ that the material
prosperity which he enjoys and which he
may bequeath to his children is due to
the principles and policies of the Republi
can party, he naturally is ready to vote
the Republican ticket.
The division of voters on national party
lines was made just before the last na
tional election. At that time local influ-

The wrman vote was an important fac

the establishment of township governmem
in the same province. The Governor, whd
is appointed, will receive a salary of $1300.
He will pass upon the acts of the town
councils and will issuo orders which will
have the same effect as ordinances when

sary measures. .
The Governor, who will also be the
Treasurer and Auditor, will be ex-offlcio
a provincial justice of the peace and In
that capacity will control the constabu
lary.

BEFEREE GREEN SAYS .
A~ HEARSE IS EXEMPT
Vehicle Necessary for an Undertaker
.to Conduct His Business in
Proper Manner.
Â¦ Frank "W. Green, referee in bankruptcy
for Shasta County, filed a report yester
day in the clerk's office of the United
States District Court, in which he decides,
subject to the approval of Judge de Haven,
that F. J. Muller. a Reddinp undertaker,
is entitled to claim a hearse as exempt.
Referee Green nays: Â«
"I find that in view of the recent deci
sion by the United States Circuit Court of
AppÂ«als, where the horse and wagon of
a painter were held to have been exempt,
that this hearse would be as necessary
to an undertaker as the horse and wagon
were to the painter, and therefore I am of
the opinion that said hearse is exempt
from execution."
A result of the entertainment re
eently . given by Berkeley Chapter, No.
178, of the Order of the Eastern Star, lo
cated at Berkeley, In behalf of the mem
bers of the* order who were sufferers by
the Galvesion disaster, was a contribution
of $121 35. which will be fax-warded

Steamer Movements.
TO ARRIVE.
THE overdue, fleet la growing day
by day and in' consequence the
underwriters are getting scared.
Vessels that should have made
port months ago are now some
where on the ocean and the gambling cm
their chancea of ever reaching port I?
growing. . :
The British ship Yarana, well known
here, is now out 155 days from Santa
Rosalia for Iquique. She took a general
cargo from Europe to the Central Amer
ican port, and was on Mer way to Iqtii
que to load a nitrate cargo for San Fran
cisco. Seventy per cent reinsurance Is
being paid on her.
The Antonie is now out 203 days from
Sydney, N. S. W., for Rotterdam. She
carries a carpro of wool and flax and the
underwriters fear that spontaneous com
bustion has made an end of the vessel.
They are paying eighty per cent to rein
sure their chances, n
The Alsterdamm Is 1S2 days out from
New York for Yokohama. She carries a
cargo of coal oil, but the chances do not
seem to be so very much against her, as
the underwriters are only offering twen
ty-five per cent on the chances that she
will not reach port.
The Flottbeck is 195 days out from
Tampa for Yokohama. She also Is not
thought to be a good risk, and only fif
teen per cent is being paid on her.
The Prince Victor is now out ninety
nine days from Newcastle, N. S. W;j for
Honolulu with a cargo of coal. When the
Doric arrived from the islands a few
days apo without any nottce of the ar
rival of the coal ship the underwriters at
once offered forty per cent to reinsure
their chances. The fear is that the Prince
Victor's cargo has caught flre and that
a total loss will follow.
The Rathdown is now out fifty-three
days from Yokohama l!or Portland, and
ten per cent is being paid on her, while
the Sofala is out forty-six days from
Yokohama and the "Westgate seventy-one
days from Hongkong, bound for this
coast. On both vessels fifteen per cent
reinsurance is being paid.
The fear for all the fleet now in the
southern seas is caused by the news of
a terrific hurricane that has swept
Samoa, Hawaii and Japan. The tail end
of it. is said to have been the south
easter that made trouble here last Tues
day night. In any event eight good,
stanch ships are overdue and the under
writers are gambling whether they pay
$1,000,000 insurance money or lose $200,000
in reinsurance.
MOVEMENTS OF TRANSPORTS.
The Freight Transport Aztec May Not
Get Away Before Monday.
The freight transport Aztec may not
get away for a day or so. The horses
that were to have gone on her have been
sidetracked and mules to replace the ani
mals lost on the I^eelanaw will go on her.
In the meantime the big carrier will have
to remain tied up at the wharf until the
mules can be gathered together and sent
down to the front. It Iook3 from this
that the "long-eared breed" is more of
value in the Philippines just now than his
better bred cousin.
Cut Rates to Mexico.
The opposition is going 1 to meet the Pa
cific . Coast Steamship Company's cut of
fifty per cent to all Mexican ports. Cap
tain' von Helms is determined to get 'his
share of the trade and his associates are
more than ready to back him up. Enough
freight has been secured to load the Mex
ico, and at every port she will meet the
Curacao on the return voyage. In this
way the Mexico has the'call on the trade,
as according to the laws of Mexico a ves
sel flying the Mexican flag must always
be given the preference "even though the
rates should be higher." The Mexico
will fly the Mexican flag, while the Cura
cao is an- American bottom.

Says It Will Be Economical

Calls Meeting of the House Commit
tee on Military Affairs for
Discussion of a
"Measure.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 23.â Chairman
Hull of the House Committee on Military
Affairs to-day called a meeting of the
committee for next Tuesday, He hopes
that a quorum will be present and that
the committee can go to work immediate
ly on the outlines of a new bill..
"It will be in the direction of economy
to pass the army bill without delay," said
Mr. Hull to-day. The army now in the
Philippines will have to be brought home
in the summer â that is, those of the men
who do not care to re-enlist. The trans
ports which go out for them should de
part laden with troops who are to replace
thf.m, else the ships will make one voyage
empty."
Sir. Hull was in conferepce to-day with
the President and with officials of the
War Department op the character of leg
islation desired by the administration. He
said the President will communicate to
Congress fully his recommendations about
the army ana he did not assume to speak
the President's mind In advance.
He thought, however, that the* adminis
tration will not be content with any
makeshift legislation, any proposition to
continue the present law for two years
more. His impression was that the Pres
ident wanted authority to raise a
regular army sufficient for the needs of
the country, 100,000 men if necessary, the
number to be reduced when there was no
longer any need for them.
Mr. Hull said the Taft commlsion had
reported that 15,000 Filipinos could be en
listed immediately in the army for the
Philippines and that they would make
good soldiers under American officers.
There was no fear of a repetition of
Great Britain's experience with the Se
poys, for the Filipinos, Mr. Hull said,
nave no national feeling like the natives
of India. Moreover, added Mr. Hull, the
experiment of enlisting native troops has
proven successful and there are no more
loyal and efficient soldiers than the na
tives enlisted in the British "? army in
India. '
NEW WAR REVENUE BZLL.
"Will Provide for a Reduction in
Stamp Taxes.
WASHINGTON*. Nov. 23. â Chairman
Payne and Representatives Dalzell and
Hepburn, acting as a sub-committee,
spent a portion of the day in drafting a
bill to amend the war revenue tax. The
peneral provisions of the bill have been
agreed upon. The reduction to be made
will be in stamp taxes, as heretofore in
dicated. A member of the committee said
to-day that although there was some dis
cussion concerning reductions upon beer
and also on cigars, cigarettes and tobac
co there did not seem to be any inclina
tion to reduce the present tax on these
articles as long as there remained stamp
taxes, which, he added, were obnoxious to
every one using them.
Although it is generally understood that
there is a complete understanding among
the members of the committee as to what
changes will be made, it is understood
that no Ironclad agreement has â¢ been
reached-and any part of the bill can be
taken up and changed. But the members
of the committee do not expect many
changes, for it is said the full Republican
membership will not be likely to meet
again until next Friday, one day before
the full committee is to be called together
The committee expects to present the bill
to the House on the first or second day
of the session.
HULL SPEAKS
OF ARMY BILL
WASHINGTON*. Not. 23.â Horrible con
ditions existing: among: the ChineÂ«a
aboard vessels in the Alaskan salmon
canning industry are portrayed In a re
port by Assistant Surgeon L. L. Lumsdon
at Angel Island. California, which has
just been made to the Marine Hospital
Service. He say* a number of vassela
have returned to San Francisco from tha
Alaska country with the history of sev
eral deaths of these Chinese worker*.
There were no physicians aboard and as a
rule no satisfactory account of the nature
of the Illness was obtainable rrom. respon
sible persona.
"The3e vessels." jcays the report, "sail
from San Francisco In March and April,
each vessel taking- about IS Chinese to
work at the canneries. Last spring neany
3uOO Chinese were taken from San Fran
cisco for this work."
The assistant surgeon says he has been
unable to arrive at a doSnite conclusion
as to the true nature of the disease, a*
the symptoms, while resembling them. arÂ«*
not entirely these of either scurvy or
beri-beri. The disease probably is one of
malnutrition, resulting from exhaustin<
labor, yoor quality of food and filthy sur
roundings. Tiiese Chinee are recruited
from the poorest and roughest element
of Chinatown and are held in practical
Â»ia.very by the Chinese bosses who pro
vide this labor. They often are worked
eighteen hours a day and live in barracks
in utter disregard of cleanliness and sani
tation. The fish they eat frequently la
well advanced In putrefaction. It h dli3
cult to conceive fully of the fllthiness
aboard.
The Chinese quarters are dark and
damp and the sanitary conditions are un
fit to print. The white men on these ves
sels disclaim responsibility for trm condi
tions under 'which the Chinese live arur
transact all business with them through â¢
Chinese foreman, the so-called No. 1
man." Five thousand cf these Chines*
recently haye come into Chinatown, San
Francisco, and with the'r lowered vitality
Â¦would fall ready prey to any infectious
disease, and thus menace public health.
It is ur?ed that these coasting vessels bo
made subject to the same laws as vessels
engaged in deep-sea voyages. ,
Assistant Surgeon Ltxmsdon Says
Sanitary Precautions An Negf
lected â Consequent Spread

Attention Called to Condi
tions at the Can

"This dissolution is made solely for bus
iness motives. I thought the plan over
and came to the conclusion that we could
mutually do more work and serve our
clients better by this change. Mr. Sloss.
as you know, will shortly go on the
Superior Court bench, and consequently
I thought there was no time like the pres
ent to make a change. There la no 111
feeling existing among members of the
present firm; in fact, we shall all oc
cupy the office rooms that we now hold.
The present personality of the firm waa
organized Just ten years ago." Cards an
nouncing tha change will be published
shortly.
The firm is composed of William H.
Chickering, William Thomas, Warren
Gregory, Marcus L. Gerstle and Marcus
C. Sloss. The latter member of the firm
was recently elected to the Superior
bench and consequently had to sever his
connection with his professional ' asso
ciates during his term of office. After
due consideration the other members of
the firm decided to dissolve.
Messrs. Chlckering and Gregory con
tinue together, and Thomas and Gerstle

"That is all."
never mentioned, however, the name of
Noyes.
As a sum total of his profit from the
Alaska Gold Mining Company, Walters
declared that he had received $200. After
a few minor questions were then asked,
Walters was turned over to the cross-ex
aminer.
"Do you know Dudley Dubose?" asked
Geary.
. "Yes."
"Ever have any mining relations with
him?"
But Attorney Pillsbury had not finished,
and before Walters had left the stand he
declared that in everything that Mc-
Kenzie had concern a favorable decision
from Judge Noyes was a "cinch." Â¦ . .-"
Samuel Knight was the first witness on
the stand after recess. He related briefly
the â¢ circumstances under which Judge
Noyes appointed receivers for the impor
tant claims in which Knight, as attorney,
was interested. In every .case McKenzie
acted as receiver, with Hubbard, Beeman
and Hume as his attorneys. In one case
Dudley Dubose acted in that capacity, al
though he was also attorney for other in-,
terests. The entire, complicated legal
story was told again to show how Mc-
Kenzie was deeply and financially inter
ested in the claims over which the court
gave him jurisdiction. A significant asser
tion of the witness was that the papers
In the case, in which McKenzie was ap
pointed receiver, were made out in appar
ent haste. Mr. Knight understood that
McKenzie and Judge Noyes had arrived
at Nome together.
The proceedings In August, to set aside
the order appointing McKenzie, were then
described. Judge Noyes refused to vacate
the order, but gave no written opinion.
The receiver had taken possession of the
claims, two of Â¦which Â¦were worked and
out of which about $42,000 In dust was
taken.
Returning then to his discussion with
Attorney Hume Knight declared that the
greatest haste had been shown and Hume
explained that In his opinion he believed
that thÂ« proper remedy was injunction
and not receivership. He told me, said
Knight, that Hubbard informed Jiim that
Judge Noyes would appoint a receiver.

every day. This state of affairs developed
until the owners of the mine swore to a
complaint charging twelve of the miners
with robbing the mine. The Marshal re
fused to serve it, but later another war
rant was issued.
At this point Judge Houghton was asked
to give way to E. M. Walters, a miner of
Nome. Walters described a deal In which
he swore that. McKenzie misrepresented
affairs to him. Walters had certain prop
erty and McKenzie promised to negotiate
a sale under conditions favorable to him,
McKenzie, the witness declared,- secured
various properties- and organized a gigan
tic corporation, with a capital stock of
$10,000,000, of which Walters was to receive
$475,000 in stock. Tills has not yet been
received by him.
Schemes to Care for Legislators and
SENATORS AND JUDGES.
Provide Jurists.
After reciting a mass of uninteresting
facts the witness struck a rich lead which
led to the national capital and to thedevi
ous ways by which mining may be made
profitable. During the various stages of
incorporation the question of mining laws
became important and McKenzie told
Walters that ?t would be necessary so to
change the mining laws as to make it
possible to take In the beach claims. This
McKenzie said, so the witness testified,
would be an easy matter, but of course
he would have to take care of some of the
Senators at Washington.
The witness declared that McKenzie as
sured him that this would be a very easy
matter. Then he would have to look after
a good, honest Judge who would see that
their interests were not neglected. All
of this, Walter3 said, McKenzie promised
to attend to without fail.
In this way the Alaska Gold Mining
Company was organized. Walters was to
get his $475,000 in stock, $500 a month and
dividends. As a matter of fact he re
ceived nothing. McKenzie offered $5 a
day, but Walters didn't neeed the
money. Then came the appointment of
McKenzie as receiver of the various prop
erties, all of which are rich and all of
which came under the control of McKen
zie. He assured Walters that the Alaska
Gold Mining Company wpuld eventually
win all the properties. ; . ,/.
Retracing his steps, Walters declared
that McKenzie had assured him in New
York he had a good man in view for
Judge and would probably secure him. He
was being taken out of one mine and
$10,000 a day out of another. Upon this
showing Knight had asked Judge Noyes
to raise the bond to $100,000. Judge Noyes
promised to take the matter up, but after
a few days declared he had forgotten.
The request was never granted. Judge
Noyes said that McKenzie was a reliable
man, an appointee of the court, and that
from time to time, as the receiver ob
talned gold, the bond would be raised.
ATTORNEY SAMUEL KNIGHT CREATED A SENSATION YESTERDAY BY SWEARING BEFORE COMMIS*
SIONER HEACOCK THAT UNITED STATES DISTRICT ATTORNEY WOODS AND DISTRICT JUDGE NOYES
ARE THE LEADERS OF A RING ORGANIZED TQ FAVOR THE ARCH SPECULATOR McKENZIE.
On the morning of July 23 McKensie told
him that he had been appointed receiver.
Calv:n ar.d McKenzie met that morning,
and Calvin said that he was going to
Siberia with a French Count for S15 a
day and expenses. McKenzie replied:
*'Ycu stay here, as we want you. As soon
as the Judee signs these papers we will
want you and 1 will give you $20 a day."
"At that time," said Calvin, "McKen
zie had a team hitched in front of his
office. About 5 o'clock in the afternoon
we took the team and with deputy re
ceivers and deputy Marshals went to
Discovery. Another team was then
hitcned up and the same thing was done."
"He was taking out bunches of them?"
asktd Attorney Pillsbury.
"Yes," was the reply. "He was In a
hurry and now and again he would go
down toward the Golden Gate HoteL fio
put Comerford in charge of Discovery."
The witness then described in detail
how McKenzie took possession of the
various claims, the Marshal in each in
stance being installed as receiver and
Calvin remaining to watch proceedings.
Two days after came orders to close down
the claim and bring the gold dust down.
This was done and then, on the follow
ing day. Calvin received orders to arrest
the men who were working the beach.
Affairs moved slowly for some time until
CaJvin was called upon to act as deputy
receiver for "No. 8" and the upper part
of "No. 5." And then McKenzie cut his
ealaiy from T2f) to $10 a day.
Calvin said in conclusion that he nat
urally took an interest in the Alaska Gold
Mining Company, as he had been promised
$50,000 In stock, which as yet he had not
received. The stock of the company rep
resmted all the claims and not any single
claim of the company.
S. C. Houghton was the next witness,
whose testimony bore directly upon the
manner in which District Judge Noyes
created receiverships. The witness re
lated the circumstances under which the
affairs of the mine became deeply In
volved. On the very day in July when
Judge Noyes arrived he was asked to
grant an injunction in a suit Instituted by
the owners of the Topkok mine arainst
alleged trespassers. . "And then Judge
Is'oyes appointed a receiver, did he not?"
asked Pillsbury.
"He did," was the reply.
"At your request?"
"On the contrary," was the reply. "It
was at the request of adverse Interests."
The witness then described In detail the
operations of the beach miners who
worked In front of the Topkok mine and
gradually encroached upon the property
which belonged exclusively to the mine.
These depredations and encroachments,
the witness. Insisted, grew more serious
How McKenzie Carted Bunches of
Eager Receivers to the Mines.
During the day the organization of the
Alaska Gold Mining Company and what
is alleged to have been its attendant
frauds were outlined. Shadows of United
States Senators and men high in judicial
power were thrown into prominent an<i
none too pleasant relief. Glimpses were
given of how laws are made to please
wealthy interests and how Judges are
chosen to suit the needs of partisans.
Neither Judges nor legislators were
spared in comment and when the day
was finished a clearer idea had been
given of the bitterness which has con
trolled contending factions for the gold of
Nome. Knight was submitted to a search
ins cross-examination, and although his
direct testimony was in no particular im
paired a strong light was thrown upon the
ways and means of securing affidavits
from men who claim to have bribed
courts. In conclusion Knight was accused
of having fled from Nome, not because
he feared contempt, but for an offense
very much more serious.
The first witness of the day was S. R.
Calvin, who had been employed by Mc-
Keczie in connection with the exciting
events which attended the affairs of the
Alarka Gold Mining Company and the
Toj<kok mine. Calvin had been a man of
general utility, assisting in perfecting the
appointment of receivers, driving away
the miners from the beach, arresting them
and making himself generally useful to
his employers. Comparatively his testi
mony was of minor importance, but its
most significant aspect was to show that
McKenzie possessed some means by which
he could tell in advance what Judge
Noves was going to do. Further than
this Calvin had very little light to throw
upon the subject on which the great fight
is raging.
CAPTTJKING CLAIMS.
SENSATION followed sensation
yesterday in the investigation of
Cape Nome mining affairs, which
is being conducted under the
guise of contempt proceedings
against Dudley Dubose. before United
States Commissioner Heacock. Attorney
Samuel Knigrht was the star witness of
the day and through him the rumors, in
definite charges, insinuations and general
ities of misconduct on the part of United
States District Judge Noyes took definite
shape in ugly charges that Judge Noyes
is corrupt in office: that he has accepted
bribes; that he has an authorized go-be
tween for the npgotlation of dishonest
bargains with powerful litigants, and that
he Js a member of an irfluentlai ring of
tricksters and schemers who are striving
to grab the gold of Nome. The testimony
was sensational, and even as It was,
Knight insisted upon declining to reveal
what he claims will make it worse than
It is.
He recited the circumstances which lei
F. P. Reece to make an affidavit in which
he swore that he had bribed Judge Noyes
Â¦with CO00, but no amount of questioning
could induce him to tell what else there
is in this startling document. Knight de
clared that he believed from the testimony
of trustworthy witnesses that Judge
Noyes, United States District Attorney J
H. Woods, Archie Wheeler, the stenogra
pher of Judge Noyes. and the arch specu
lator, McKenzie. are parties to a mam
moth conspiracy and members of a cor
rupt ring. â¢

Samuel Knight, Who Swears That He Believes the Evidence of Men Who Say

clients not to obey the order or the Cir
cuit Court. Judge Noyes also said that
he did not believe that the orders which
he had made were appealable. He re
fused positively to sign the orders pre
sented by Knight, but finally he did Issue
an order staying all proceedings.
The Incidents of McKenzie's arrest were
then described. After the arrest the Mar
shals went to the bank and there It was
discovered that $9000 belonging to Knight's
clients was missing. This practically con-
I eluded the direct examination.
Under cross-examination. Knight devel
oped nothing particularly new, Geary con
fining himself solely .to a discussion of the
j bonds. It was only after Knight had been
j released from cross fire that he developed
the sensation of the day. the ugly
charges, allegations and insinuations of
bribery against Judge Noyes.
In his own behalf Knight then made a
statement. He declared that some time be
fore he left Nome he bad heard that
money had been corruptly used and said
he: "I believed that it, was my duty to
make a .thorough Investigation." As a
result ofÂ» that Investigation, Knight de
clared that he had received an "affidavit
In which F. P. Reece swore that he had
paid $2000 to Judge Noyes as a bribe to in
fluence his official action.
"Reece came to my office and informed
me that he would give me evidence of the
Â¦ most important character on condition
that It should not be given publicity while
he was in Nome. He was; afraid that
Judge Noyes would imprison him and he
did not wish to spend the winter in jail.
On October 19, at night In my office, I took
the deposition of Reeco and on the follow
ing morning I was to appear in the
chambers or Judge Noyes. District At
torney Woods, Archie Wheeler, Judgo
Noyes' stenographer, and Judge Noyes
were present. Wood asked me If I had an
affidavit in which a public officer was
charged with crime.
"I told him that I had seen such an af
fidavit and Woods demanded it. I re
plied that the affidavit contained allega
tions which required Investigation and
that I would think the matter over. That
afternoon -I left Nome on the same
steamer with Reece. This is the story of
my departure and any man who says
that I bribed Judge Noyes or attempted
to bribe him in my office or any other of
fice tells a falsehood."
CORRUPT RINGSTERS.
Knight Makes Startling Allegations
Against Alaskan Federal Officers.
"Do you know of any person," asked
Attorney Geary, "who either directly or
indirectly bribed or attempted to bribe
Judge Noyea?"
"I have been told," was the reply, "that
he had been offered bribes and had taken
them. But this is hearsay."
"Do you know that Judee Noyes ac
cepted a bribe in any case? asked Geary.
"I decline to answer, as the evidence I
have may not be trustworthy."
Being pressed time and again for a re
ply. Knight finally answered:
l 't have heard such charges against
Judge Noyes from persons whom I believe
to be trustworthy. 1
"Who were these persons?" Geary per
sisted.
"I decline to answer."
Attorney Geary then made a long excur
sion in an effort to learn why Knight had
so hurriedly left Nome for this city. The
questioner claimed that Knight feared ar
rest for having, he alleged, asked County
Clerk John T. Reed to antedate certain
documents. Knight most emphatically
denied this allegation or his fear and the
Incident was dropped. Much time was
then consumed In tracing the various
steps by which Reece came to make his
affidavit. accusing Judge Noyes with cor
ruption.
The inquiry developed that Reece
wanted $1500, but Knight paid him $750 for
his expenses from Nome to New York,
where he was to hold himself in readiness
in the event that his testimony would be
needed at a Congressional investigation.
An effort to secure from Reece a second
affidavit failed, and the questioner inti
mated that Reece had already made a
second one in which he declared that the
first was false. After skirmishing for
awhile Geary asked Knight why hÂ© had
not shown Noyes the affidavit in which
the accusations were made against him.,
and Knight replied that he did not in
tend to give such information to the ring.
With that the cross-examination ended
and Attorney Plllsbury again took a
hand.
"What do you mean by a ring?" he
as iced.
"When I say the ring," replied Knlgrht,
"I mean a combination in which .were
Judge Noyes and District Attorney
Woods to favor anything that McKenzie
wanted."
"Was Archie Wheeler, the stenographer
of Judge Noyes, a member of that ring?"
"I had heard that he was the go-be
tween for Judge Noyes," was the reply,
and with this answer tho examination
ended. It will be resumed Monday morn
ins.
