no other place on earth for tiny Montee Ledderhos. Though of shuffling,
unsteady gait, without u?e of tongue or sign, his diminutive but sinewy
body 1? over alert to obey the mandates cf his distorted brain. Scheming
and cver an ally to death, he is a menace to the public safety, small as he

A MERE baby wil'. be committed to the madhouse by Judge
William P. Lav.-lor to-day. A commitment consigning Montee
Ijt-dcierrioF, a toridlmg youngster 4 years of age. to the asylum
for the insane at Napa was drawn up In the office of the County
Clerk yesterday morning. The signature and seal of the court
will be affixed to-day and the child, perhaps in the arms of a
guard, will be carried from his home to dwell until death, the"
"The asylum for the insane is plainly the place for him. HI3 mania is
to destroy, to kill and to maim . himself. There is no doubj that he will
be a source of endless worry to the management of the Napa Asylum, and
I fear that the trouble he will cause may result- in a demand being made
that he be discharged from that Institution and committed to the Home for
the Feeble-minded. Though there is no doubt that the ; Home for the
Feeble-minded is better fitted for the care of such 1 youngsters â or rather
simple-minded youngstersâ in my opinion the only safe place to keep him
is in the asylum. His mania at any moment might cause him to seek"
gratification . among tho helpless Inmates of the Home, for the Feeble
minded, and even though he may be the source of endless worry to the
Insane Asylurr) His Proper flbode.
. "The child Is plainly insane. He cannot be classed among the simple
minded. Simple-minded patients are commonly divided into three classes â
idiots, imbeciles and cretins. The line of demarcation between the three
degrees Is; however, only relative. The idiot Is the person absolutely bereft
of intelligence, and tho other two ascend the scale.' The difference between
a simple-minded person and an Insane person Is plain. The so-called simple
minded person, who comes within the three degrees named, is usually, or
most always, to be more correct, congenitally so. In his case there is a
deficiency in the brain. He was never gifted with full mental capacity, and
his advance or the opposite would not find him another place on the mental
scale. Insanity, in the strict sensa of the term, is usually acquired through
injury or abuse of nature. The term insanity presupposes that the patient
up to the time of, the affliction was the possessor of a normal mind, but
that disease, injury or abuse disorganized its functions. These latter con
ditions are manifested by this baby patient. I have gathered from the
clinical history of the case that both the lad's father and mother were
nornial people of sound intelligence. .The story of the lad's injury when an
infant, the result of a fall from a hammock, has also been made known to
me, as well as the fact of his subsequent fever or measles, which is
usually accompanied by fever. . Doubtless the child's insanity was caused
by. the fall, aided perhaps by the fever, but from ray examination. of him,
being assisted with such meager details of his life, I am unable to assign
the exact cause of his condition.
After completing his examination Dr. Lustig said:
Her health broken from long and constant â¢worry and watching, the
lad's mother, when all hope had gone, gave up to her illness. Her hus
band, Theodore Ledderhos, had her removed from their home, 2501% Lar
kln street, to St. Winifred's Hospital. There she will undergo an opera
tion in the hope that her life may be saved, but a doubt hangs upon the
hope. After, her removal to the hospital Master Ledderhos was taken in
charge by Mrs. Barbee.- His constant attempts to commit murder and to
end his own existence by, butting his abnormal skull against harder sub
stances finally caused .her' husband to make the complaint on which he
was taken before the Insanity Commission.
appeared on the plate. This was the cause of the child's insanity. The
dark spot marked where the skull had thickened from the wound received
in infancy, and behind it the dim traces of degenerated brain tissue and
blood clots could be discerned. To remove the cause of the lad's insanity
would be to kill him. A large and vital portion of the brain was involved,
and to lift from it the bony cover that is bearing down so cruelly upon
it would only serve to free the blood vessels that long ago degenerated
under the pressure, and almost instant death, so the physicians say, would
be the reward of their labors. L ' ! :â¢ 'Â¦:'.
Upon this clinical history, of -the case the physicians of the College of
Osteopathy decided that a radiographâ an X -ray photoâ of the child's
skull should be taken as preliminary to an operation, if such was found
to be reasonably certain of successful result. The baby patient was taken
to the laboratory of E. Fleischman, 611 Sutter street, and subjected to the
ray. The result was marvelous :rom tho standpoint of the radiographer,
but it extinguished the last spark of hope that remained in the _ minds
of the child's parents. Just at the base of the skull a large dark spot
fin Operation Would Mean Death-
Baby Ledderhos has been an enigma to the physicians of this city
since he was four months old. Recently he was treatc/3 by Dr. C. N. Mil
ler. That physician passed the case by a3 hopeless. Physician after phy
sician was consulted In the hope that at least the child's brutal habits
might be corrected. Dr. Louise Heilbron, who is now a resident of San
Diego, was tho last to attempt to relieve the child. She had the youngster
removed to the California College of Osteopathy. There it was decided
that the lad's insanity was congenital â from birth â but was perhaps aggra
vated by the existence of pressure on the brain from a wound jreceived
some time in infancy. The child's parents remembered a falKthe lad
received when but four months of age. He was left in a hammock sleeping
one day, when a playful youngster ran against the hammock. The baby
was thrown out and struck in tho bed of a little creek on the back of his
head. From that day his health began to wane. Finally he was taken
with j> fever. For weeks he hovered between life and death, and then
began to improve. But along with the light of health in his eyes there
came the flash of insanity. As a baby of eight months there was upper
most in his mind a passion for brutal things. Anything he could lay his
dimpled baby hands upon he would crush or hurl to the floor. This de
structive temperament developed with his months until the taking of life
seemed to be the aim of his existence.
Judge Lawlor said that if Dr. Rethers, who is acting with Dr. Lustig
on the commission, would agree that the child was not simple-minded. but
insane he would sign a commitment consigning him to the' Napa Insane
Asylum for treatment. Dr. Rothers was called upon to make an ex
amination of thÂ« child. He immediately pronounced the lad insane, and
with Dr. Lustig: signed the certificate setting forth the nature' of the
chTTd's malady. This preliminary disposed of, the commitment was drawn
up. The little patient was led back to Mrs. Barbee's home to await the
coming of the Sheriff, who will take him to the asylum. The commitment
will be presented to Judge Lawlor this morning. His signature will be
aflixed and Jlttlc Montee Ledderhos will leave his birthplace to go to/ the
home where in all probability the remaining years of his life will be
passed. . '
J. W. Earbee, who affixed his name to the warrant upon which the
child was arrested, was called to the stand. He testified that for over three
years the child's parents had labored in vain to develop the child's
morality. He was vicious, destructive, murderous and brutal, the witness
said. A email fortune had been expended on him in an effort to secure
relief, but without result. Even the lad's mother had despaired of effect
ing a cure, lie said, and the safety of the child's relatives as well as the
public demanded that he be deprived of the power to do wrong.
Commission to give his views of the case. Dr. Lustig said that the case
was plainly one of insanity and r.ot simple-mindedness. The lad, in his
opinion, he paid, should be committed to the asylum for the insane.

MERE BABY ADJUDGED A MANIAC AND WILL BE

COMMITTED TO THE INSANE ASYLUM AT NAPA
Montee Ledderhos, though but four,
years of age, has been adjudged a maniac by
the Insanity Commission. He will be com
mitted to the Asylum for the Insane at Napa
by Judge William P. Lazvlor to-day. The
youngster is t)ic son of Mr. and Mrs. Theo
dore Ledderhos, who reside at 2501 1-2 Lar
kin street. Whai the child was but a fezv
months old he suffered a fall from a ham
mock. He fell in the bed of a creek and it is
bclicz'cd so seriously injured the base of his
brain at that time tJiat his present insanity
may be attributed to the accident. Members
of the Insanity Commission zvho examined
him, however, arc unable at this time, owing
partly to the absence of a detailed clinical his
tory of the case, to advance a positive opinion
as to the cause of his malady. Since the
child's injury he has been constantly under
the care of physicians. 'Everything known to
medical science zvhich zvas zvithin the pozver
of his parents' limited means to procure zvas
tried in the hope of at least relieving, even
though a complete cure zvas impossible, the
sufferings of their baby. All efforts to aid
him haz'c been futile, herzvever, and the fight to
secure his commitment to an asylum has just
been won. In all probability the remainder of
his years on earth zvill be passed behind the
bars of a madhouse.
Homicidal and suicidal mania have
caused Montee Ledderhos' relatives to seek his
imprisonment. Without provocation he will
assault any lii'ing creature zvithin his reach.
His favorite weapon is a hatpin, but zvithout
one he is equally dangerous. Deprived of the
opportunity to gratify his lust for murder the
tiny maniac zvill cruelly injure himself. But
ting into stone pillars and throzving himself
head foremost to the pavement are common
practices zvith him, and unless closely zvatched '
he zcill continue battering himself until uncon
sciousness comes. His brutal and murder
ous treatment of his baby sister is past under
standing. He zvould frequently assault her
zvithout zvarning, and zvhen stopped by pa

laughter. From infancy he was of destruc
tive disposition, and this tendency gradually
dcz'cloped until he is more brute than human.
He will throw anything that comes into his
hands at any one zvho is near at the time.
Since his birth he has not spoken, but endea

"His skull i3 most peculiar in formation. What I would call knots
stick out all over his head, except the forehead, which recedes and Is low.
He refuses to walk steadily alone and constantly throws himself head
foremost to the pavement. For this reason it is always necessary that
two persons accompany himâ one on each side to support him â If. Indeed,
they are not called upon to defend the passers-by. During his life he haa
never spoken a word. His language is an incoherent jargon and Is punc
tuated with devilish screams that freeze one's blood. His commitment to
the asylum will save those who now keep him perhaps from a fate as
pitiable as that which has befallen his mother. ThÂ«re may yet be a
chance to save him from death in the asylum: It would be better that It
occur on the operating table when scientists are bending over him seeking
â¢to dispel the cloud that darkens his mind."
'.'He will sneak up behind an Intended victim and without warning will
inflict what injury he can. Hatpins are a favorite and dangerous weapon in
his hands. He will stab and slash at any one who attempts to interfere
with him. Great caution must be used In approaching him. for no one caa
tell what weapon he may have concealed in his hand.
"He was always brutal in his habits. Frequently, when he was not
watched, he would steal upon his baby sister, grasp her by the hair and
hurl her to the floor. Then he would attempt to stamp out her life, anrt
more than once her tiny neck has borne the imprint of hi3 heels. Again.
he would strike her and hurl anything he could get hold of In an evident
hope of maiming her. Only the day before yesterday he assaulted his
father. "Without a word of warning he picked up a stove-lifter and hurled
it with all of his maniacal strength. The iron missile struck his father
on the chest and Inflicted a painful wound. Had Mr. Ledderhos been
struck on the head the result would have been serious. "When sitting at
the table, without warning he will grasp the cloth and hurl the dishes
to the floor. Those that remain unbroken he will break if the opportunity
Is afforded him. Curbed In his desire, he will work himself into a frenzy
and then can only be cared for by main force, and It takes considerable to
handle him.
Always Brutal In His habits.
"Ever since he was Injured when an infant Montee has been Incor
rigible," said Mr. Kaeintz yesterday. "I was to have testified as to hla
actions before the Insanity Commissioners to-day, but I was so busy" that
I could not get there. If any more testimony la needed, however, I will be
glad to go. The little fellow should have been In the asylum long ago.
Though the doctors say he' Is hopelessly Insane, I am of opinion that ha
would not have been as bad as he is had he been placed in the asylum,
wfiere he could have received proper attention, two years ago. Though
his mind is disorganized, he has sufficient left to profit by the leniency
of his parents, who were wont to gratify his every desire when by some
peculiar action on his part they knew that he had a desire to gratify.
Though he Is? not a medical expert, Kmanuel Kaeintz. who resides at S
Golden place, shares the opinion advanced by Drs. Lustig and Rethers.
Kaeintz is an uncle of the unfortunate child who is about to be committed
to the madhouse. With the rest of the child's relatives, he had long hoped
that pome relief for the baby's awful malady might be found. Even now
ho has hopes that when the youngster grows stronger, if the fates so
decree, an operation may be performed with successful results.

until the end."
Early yesterday morning the lad was taken before Judge Lawlor for
examination. His aunt. Mr?. J. \V. Earbee. who has been keeping the ehiM
with hÂ«r at ZZ1? Lombard street, assisted by a friend, led the child into
court. E>r. D. D. Lustig was called upon as a member of the Insanity
Formal y Declared to Bz Inscn:.
Cver two years ago the attention cf the California Society for the
Prevtntlrn of Cruelty to Children was called to the strange condition of
this lad's mind. The mother, wearied of her efforts to stay the homicidal
and fuicidal ;rndcr.cie3 of her rhild. Fought the a'id of the society in an
effort to plac; him in the Home for the Feeble-minded. Ledderhos was
tafcen tofere the directors of this Institution, but they rejected him. They
caid there was no room, but other children entered dally. The courts were
appealed to, but orders for his commitment to the home were regularly
evaded. F"or ivo yÂ«*ars the ftÂ£ht between the California Society, the courts
and tJie fllrectoni cf the Home for the Feeble-minded was carried on.
Finally the society was forced to pursue a different line of proceeding.
The fact that the lad wan not focble-minded, but was the possessor of a
mind of normal strength but hopele?sly disorganized, became generally
known ar.d the asylum for the Insane alone remained as a refuge for him.
In Napa Asylum, however, his jangled mind may take full sway, but by
to-night that institution may harbor a scene unparalleled throughout these
fr.lsed Statesâ tbÂ« s=eene of a baby boy, his tiny arms he'.d fast in leathern

ANDERSON, Ind., Oct. 5.â The
meeting which closed here at 10
o'clock to-night was the last of a
series of remarkably large politl
i cal demonstrations made in con
nection with the appearance of William
J. Bryan in Indiana. Mr. Bryan left In
! dianapolis early this morning with the in-
I tention of visiting during the day as
j many places as possible in what is known
! as the eas belt of the State and in pursu
ance of that purpose he almost circled J^he
city of Indianapolis, visiting no fewer
j than nine counties and making an even
I dozen speeches. The speeches were made
j in succession at Noblesville, Arcadia, Tip
i ton, Klwood, Alexandria, Marion. Hart
j ford City, Muncie, Winchester, Richmond,
I Newcastle and Anderson. â¢
j A majority of these places are impor
| tant manufacturing centers and all the
i communities traversed are considered Re
| publican in politics. They could not, how
; ever, have given the Democratic, candi-
I date a more cordial reception than was
j extended if the sentiment had been pro
i nouncedly for him. There were immense
| outpourings at all the towns visited and
I no interruptions indicating pronounced
! opposition occurred. On the contrary,
there was at most places much enthusi
asm by Mr. Bryan's supporters, and after
i the last speech was concluded he ex
pressed himself as greatly pleased, with
| the day's experience. The speeches aver
i aged half an hour in duration, though the
Anderson speech was much longer, and
most of them were made either from the
car platform or from stands erected in
: the vicinity of the stopping places. In
one or two instances Mr. Bryan refused
to go to distant stands because of the
difficulty of getting through the crowds
and the loss of time. Trusts formed the
eubject of most of the speeches of the
day, but at Richmond Mr. Bryan devoted
all his time to imperialism.
The presiding officer at the Richmond
meeting was Henry U. Johnson, formerly
a prominent member of Congress, and
until recently a pronounced Republican.
Mr. Bryan said that imperialism is not
a prophecy but history, and said that we
were taxing the Porto Ricans without
giving them representation.
"Your own President," said Mr. Bryan,
"said it was our 'plain duty' to give free
trade to Porto Rico, and your own mem
ber of Congress (Mr. Watson) was op
posed to the Porto Rican bill until the
President called him to the White House
and begged him to vote for the bill and
asked him to do it, not for the sake of
duty, but for the sake of party harmony.
Republicans, in the game of Republican
politics, party harmony is a higher card
than 'plain duty.' I want to ask you if
you are prepared to surrender everything
for party harmony,"
Mr. Bryan continued: "I confess that
It is hard for me to be parliamentary in
my language when I think of men far re
moved from danger who are not exposing
their own bodies to the hardships of war,
who are speculating on how much trade
can be purchased with some mother's son.
Republicans, if you want to buy trade
with human blood go and buy it with your
own blood and don't send other people's
children there.
"Republicans, you prate about the na
tion's destiny. Do you want this nation to
be a bully and a braggart? Do you want
this nation to go out seeking weaker na
tions to subdue and hold jn vassalage?"
While Mr. Bryan was speaking at
Marion Borne one in the audience askeJ
in regard to the North Carolina negro
vote.
Mr. Bryan said: "My friend, I am glad
that you asked me that; I am prepared
for you. Now, I am going to assume that
the Republican who asked the question
is an honest man. I am going to ask him
about the constitution of the Republican
State of Oregon. I. will read a provision
of that constitution. It says:
" 'Section 35â No free negro or mulatto
not residing in this State at the time of
th% adoption of this constitution shall
come, reside, or be within this State, hold
any real estate or make any contract or
maintain any such therein, and the legis
lative assembly shall provide by . penal
laws for the removal' by public ofllcers of
all such negroes and mulattoes and for
their effectual exclusion from the State
and for the punishment of -persons who
shall bring them into the State or em
ploy or harbor them.'

where stops were made.
Two immense meetings were addressed
by Governor Roosevelt to-night, one at
; Davenport, Iowa, and the other at Rock
Island, III.
The train arrived at Davenport at 8
o'clock, somewhat behind time. The Gov
ernor and his party were driven to a tent
in the western limits of the city, where
an immense meeting was held and where
he spoke for thirty minutes.
Immediately upon the conclusion of his
remarks at that place he was driven to
Rock Island, where a great stroet parade
was moving. Immense numbers of people
lined the streets on all sides and the Gov
ernor's carriage was driven for several
miles through the shouting populace. It
was half past nine before he reached the
stand to talk. lie spoke for not more
than twenty minutes.
At the Davenport meting Governor
Roosevelt made the principal address of
the day. He spoke along familiar lines,
1 He referred to what he said about the
plan of the Democratic campaign to
ignore tho silver issue in the i2ast and
said:
"Now distrust any party, distrust any
body of men who dare not tell you how
they stand on the great questions before
the people. Distrust them and especially
if they stand one way in one part of the
Union and another way in another part
of the Union. Now we are for tho gold
standard. "We are for the gold standard
on the Pacific Coast and in the "Valley of
the Mississippi or anywhere else. We are
straight for tho gold standard."
WATERLOO, Iowa, Oct. 5.â A great
demonstration was held here to-day In
honor of Governor Roosevelt, who arrived
here from his trip through Nebraska. An
hour's stop was made, which gave the
Governor timo before the speaking began
to drive through the city and partake ot
a luncheon with General David B. Hen
derson, Speaker of the national House of
Representatives, who joined the party
here. General Shaw also joined the party.
A platform had been erected in the City
Park, where the speaking occurred this
afternoon. A large crowd was present,
including many strangers from the sur
rounding towns. At the conclusion of
Governor Roosevelt's address United
States Senator Dolliver and General Cur
tis Guild Jr. of Boston also made speeches.
DAVENPORT, Iowa, Oct. 5.â The sec
ond stop of Governor Roosevelt in Iowa
to-day was made at Waterloo. Great
preparations had been made for the visit
and an Immense crowd was assembled in
the park adjacent to the station to listen
to the speaking. The meeting was ad
dressed first by Governor Roosevelt and
next by Governor Shaw of Iowa. The
day was beautiful and the demonstration
magnificent. Governor. Roosevelt said in
part: Â¦ â
"I do not appeal to Iowa because Iowa
leads and the rest of us follow. Iowa
possesses that combination of honesty,
courage and common sense which makes
us follow/ and makes us safe in turning
to her in any crisis. Now, then, we are
asked to give up our material prosperity.
Why are we asked to give it up? For the
sake of turning over the Philippines to an
unspeakably cruel and an unspeakably
corrupt syndicate of Chinese halfbreeds."
"What about the trusts?" asked a voice.
"We will have to ask that an essay be
written by Mr. Croker on that subject,
and then if you would like further litera
ture on the trusts we will get Chairman
Jones 'of the Democratic National Com
mittee to write one on the cotton-bale'
trust."
The special Roosevelt train stopped at
West Liberty for the purpose of changing I
engines some time after dark to-day. The
fact becoming known about the town a
wild and enthusiastic crowd surrounded
the train and insisted on the Governor
showing himself. Governor Roosevelt ap
peared on the rear platform of the car
and greeted his audience with a few
words. A rush was then made to shake
hands and women and children became
involved in a whirlpool of humanity which
for a time promised disaster to some of
the weaker . ones. Fortunately the train
pulled dut in time to prevent accident.
the Civil War: it makes it unlawful for
a free negro to go into the State, and it
authorizes the officers to put him out.
But you say that it is old. LÂ«t me re
mind you that last June an effort was
made to repeal that portion of the con
stitution and the effort to repeal it was
defeated although the State went Repub
i lican."
Mr. Bryan then pointed to Porto Rico
and the Sultanate of Sulu as he has dona
in former speeches.
At Hartford City Mr. Bryan found a
toxt for his remarks in some McKinley
posters conspicuously displayed on a dead
wall in the distance. Referring to these
posters, Mr. Bryan said:
I Bee over on the side of that barn a hill cr
j roster, and all that I can make out from here
Is that McKinley was right. Now,, the ques
tion 1 want to ask is, which time was he risrht?
You know, my friends, a man who is on both
sides of a question has a great advantage over
the man who is only on one side. The mar.
who gfits both sides must be rlcht some time,
but when was Mr. McKinley rightâ when he
denounced fJrover Cleveland's nnanclfU policy,
or when he did the same thing that Mr. Cleve
land did? Which time was he right-in 1S:Â«6,
Â¦when he said in his letter of acceptance that
we did not need more money, or this year,
when hfr boasted in his letter of acceptance
that we had more money and therefore ought
to be glad? Was he right when he said in his
letter of 18S8 that he would keep in circulation
all the silver, or when he signed the bill to
retire the greenbacks and substitute a national
bank note? AVas he right when in his inaugu
ral address he promised to enforce the law
against the trusts, or was he right when he did
not enforce the law against the trusts when he
had promised to do so?
Was he rlshi when he pointed out the evils
df the trust in his inaugural message, or was
he right when he appointed an Attorney Gen
eral from New Jersey, the home of trusts, and
allowed him to draw his salary without en
forcing the laws intrusted to his kf-epini?? Was
he right when he said in 1S:<7 that forcible an
nexation was criminal ag-gresslon and con
trary to our code of morality, or was he right
when he sent 65,000 soldiers 7000 miles away
from home to force annexation upon an un
willing people? Was he right when he said
last December that it was our "plain duty" to
give free trade to Porto Rico, or was he right
when he asked the members of Congress to
vote aealnst giving free trade to Porto Rico?
I want you Republicans to take both arguments
made by your President and then see which
argument you will accept.
There were three or. four times as many
people as could hear the speaker's voice,
the crowd extending in some distance as
much as two blocks.
The Presidential candidate then devoted
his attention to the trusts.
i?C B P' an spoke to an enormous crowd
at the fair grounds in Anderson to-night
and at the close of his address returned
to Indianapolis for the night.
ROOSEVELT'S STRENGTH WANES
Heavy Campaign Work That Is
Wearing on the Governor.
ROCK ISLAND, Â¦111.. Oct. 5.-Governor
Roosevelt, who spoke in this city and
Davenport. Iowa, to-night, thus closing
another day of hard campaigning, is be
ginning to feel the effects of the arduous
work undertaken by him at the request
of the Republican managers.
Governor Roosevelt, since he began his
itinerary through the northwestern
States, has been speaking from ten to
twenty times each day, closing the day's
labor usually with a night meeting. Many
of these meetings have been in the open
air, requiring extra exertion on his part.
He has now been on this journey for
more than thirty days, and though strong
beyond the powers of most men to en
dure, he is beginning to show signs of
distress and a falling voice. He has been
worked unmercifully by the State Com
mittees ot the different States through
which he has passed. Beyond this he
has had to endure unlimited handshak
ing, Interviews without number and much
pulling and hauling by the eager but in
considerate mob which has swarmed
around him in all the cities of any con
siderable size which he has visited. If
some relief is not afforded his physical
powers he may be unable to last to the
end of the campaign. It has even -now
been suggested that all his Eastern en
gagements be postponed for one week.
This matter will be determined by the
National Committee on the arrival of
Governor Roosevelt in Chicago Saturday
night. Â¦

WTLKESBARRE. Pa.. Oct. 5.â The crisis
in the coal miners* strike seems to be ap
proaching. A well-known operator here
said yesterday that there was an under
standing at the meeting of the representa
tives of the big companies and the indi
vidual operators In this city last Tues
day. According to the understanding the
notices of Increase of wages were not to
be posted all at the same time, but grad
ually. This part of the programme has
now been carried out. The companies and
nearly all the operators are in line for a
10 per cent increase.
It is now up to President Mitchell to
decide what he Is going to do In the mat
ter. If he delays action with the idea in
view that the operators will make a bet
ter offer he is liable to delay a settlement
of the strike Indefinitely. An analysis of
the 10 per cent increase offered shows that
the average miners' wages would not b-
Increased fully 10 per cent, but It is ar
gued that it is better than nothing: that
it is a victory after all for the strikers;
that it is the entering wedge, and that if
the United Mine-workers keep their or
ganization intact they can compel the
operators to make further concessions in
the years to come.
It Is said that President Mitchell take'
this view of the situation himself. It is
known, however, that some of President
Mitchell's advisers are against a settle
ment on the 10 per cent basis.

EREAK AMONG THE OPERATORS.
in Hazlston District.
C. A. Fardee & Co. Start Ball Boiling
HAZLETON, Pa., Oct. 5.â The belief
prevalent here to-night that the anthra
cite coal strike is approaching an end is
considerably strengthened by the action
of the individual operators to-day in fol
lowing the lead of the big coal carrying
and coal mining railroads ,by offering a
net increase of 10 per cent in the wages of
their employes. The first break among
the individual operators in this district
Â¦was made to-day, when C. A. Pardee &
Co., operating the Cranberry and Crystal
Range collieries, offered their employes a
10 per cent net increase in wages and a
reduction in the price of powder of $1 50
per keg. the decrease in the price of pow
der to be taken into account in the ad
vancing of the wages. That four more
of the individual mine owners will make
the same offer is hardy doubted.
It was learned to-day that before the
advance wan made public by the Pardee
Company several of the general superin
tendents of other individual coal com
panies were invited to the Pardee Com
pany's office in this city for the purpose
of giving their views on the proposed of
fer. These reports did not say what their
companies would do. but It was learned
that the consensus of opinion was that if
the mine owners wished to keep their col
lieries in operation they would have to in
crease the wages of their men. None of
the superintendents at the meeting would
Fay anything in regard to the report that
the coal carrying roads had made con
cessions to the individual operators in the
matter of freight rates. The representa
tive of the Associated Press was told to
night by a prominent mining official, who
would positively know if the railroads had
conceded anything, that as far as he knew
the railroads had not reduced the rates
to any individual company in this region.
Prestdent Mitchell of the United Mine
Workers is much interested in the ad
vance made by the individual companies,
but would say nthing for publication. He
continues to say that the strike cannot
be settled without a convention, and that
he is waiting on the operators.
In the meantime the men now on strike,
said to number 133,000. are not wavering
under the proffered increase in wages.
In the Lackawanna and Wyoming dis
tricts not a mine is working. The condi
tions remain about the same in the Le
high Valley rearion, while jn the Schuylkill
district more men have laid down their
tools and quit.
At quitting time to-night an attack was
made on the mine workers employed in
the Lattlmer mine. About fifty men.
while being conveyed to their homes at
Hollywood in a railroad car drawn by a
mine engine, were attacked by about 100
strikers. Stones and rocks were thrown
at the men in the car, and two of the
workmen were severely cut about the
head. Sheriff Harvey, who was on the
car, ordered the engineer to stop, and as
he and a few deputies stepped from the
coach the attacking party scattered in all
directions. Two pistol shots were heard,
but which side fired them is not known.
INDIVIDUAL OPERATORS ACT.
This Is Regarded as the Beginning
of the End of the Strike.
PHILADELPHIA. Oct. 5.â To-day's de
cision of the individual coal operators to
offer a 10 per cent increase in wages to
the striking mine workers Is regarded
throughout the anthracite region as the
beginning of the end of the strike. Nearly
all the individual operators to-day made
announcements of their willingness to
grant the increase, and notices to this ef
fect will, it is expected, be posted at the
various independent collieries to-morrow.
Some have already been posted. It is
fully believed that the few operators who
have not y"et expressed their Intention on
the subject will fall in line with the others
and grant the increase.
According to some of the operators,
powder will be sold to the miners at Jl 50
per keg, Instead of $2 75 as heretofore
charged, but this reduction will be taken
into consideration In figuring the net 10
per cent advance.
No other concessions to the strikers are
hinted at. and, in fact, it has been openly
declared by some of the officials of the
big companies that no further conces
sions will be granted.
The individual operators delayed an
nouncing their willingness to grant the
increase pending the report of a commit
tee sent by them to New York to endeavor
to secure some concessions from the coal
carrying companies. The committee was
unsuccessful and so reported, and the
operators, feeling that further opposition
to the big companies was useless, decided
to follow their lead and grant the ad
vance.
It Is the general opinion that a great
majority of the striking mine workers will
be satisfied to accept the offer and return
to work, but they express determination
to await the decision of President Mitchell
of the United Mine Workers.
Mr. Mitchell will give no Indication of
his probable action in the matter beyond
his oft-repeated assertion that the men
themselves decide in convention all ques
tions bearing on a settlement of the dif
ferences with the operators. He, however,
would not state when such convention will
be called by him.
The opinion prevails that he will wait
until every operator expresses a willing
ness to grant an increase. Meantime ar
rangements are proceeding for strikers*
parades and mass meetings at Shenan
doah to-morrow and at Scranton next
Wednesday.
RUSSIAN CRUISER RUNS AWAY.
Refused to Fight the Chinese Fleet in

LONDON,. Oct. 6. 4:15 a. m.^It Is re
ported in St. Petersburg, according to th>,
correspondent of the Times at the Rus
sian capital, that the Chinese fleet in For
mosa Straits attempted to engage the
Russian armored cruiser Rurik, but th-j
latter's speed frustrated the "plan.
The correspondent says it is probable
the allies' sqadrons will force the Chinese
fleet to capitulate or will destroy , t mnese
Shanghai telegrams announce that the
imperial edict dated September SO order
ing the court to be removed to Sinan-Fu
was issued owing to the famine at Tai

sl C. They * 0 "Press the opinion that the
object of the recent edicts regarding the
degradation of Chinese personages of high
rank is merely to gain time and to enabla
China to be in a better position to defy
the powers, as the new capital would ba
virtually inaccessible from the coast.
The Shanghai correspondent of the
Morning: Post, discussing tnis aspect of
the case, remarks:
"The German troops have no means of
transport.* and any attempt to follow ths
Chinese court would be therefore quite
futile."
He says the Chinese firmly believe m
the existence of a Russo-German agree
ment under which Russia will take all
the territory north of the preat wall and
Germany the provinces of; Chill and Shan
tung.
The Times representative at Shanghai
?ays: "It Is believed here that highly in

only intended to hoodwink the powers."
PAEADE OF MDTE-WOREEBS.
Demonstration That Will Delay the
Withdrawal of Troops.
SHENANDOAH, Pa., Oct. 6.âArrangre
ments have been completed by the local
branches of the United Mine workers for
a biar parade and mass meeting here to
morrow afternoon. Invitations nave been
extended to all the strikers In the Shenan
doah and Mahanoy valleys to take part
In the affair. The principal feature or the
demonstration will be an address by Na

Organizer Harris to-day sent representa
tives to all the neighboring towns and
mining patches to notify the unions thers
of the proposed demonsratlon. Mr. Har

boys to be In line.
General Gobln said to-night that while
he did not apprehend any disturbance he

IN MINERS' STRIKE
CAM. ir.'P.EAr. WELLINGTON HO
TEL. WASHINGTON. CVt. f..- While the
;>owtrt are endeavoring to determine upon
a fraFii- Â«if negotiation acceptable to all
they are ais-o discussing the- nttitude the/
Â¦uil! adopt toward the Empress Dowager.
There is not the slightest intention on MM
;>art Â«.f any povernment of demann:!^
ihat th^ Empress Dowager bo physically
junish^d for the part sh<' played in the
recent outrages. In fact, should she rc
iurn to Peking she would undoubtedly be
given ample protection. Bat it seems to
ue the general expression of all the pow
ors that tho Empren Dowager shall i>"
excluded from further participation in rfio
administration of Chinese affairs. Bi
cause fif the friendliness she has always
displayed toward the Russian Govern
ment the St. Petersburg authorities arc
expected to lend her their support as far
as it is possible to do so. but with Grcai
Britain. Germany. Japan and the United
States favorable to her degradation it is
hardly lik< ly that Russia will insist thai
*he remain in power. The Empress Dow
ager probably understands the purpose of
' 'iirissoi.cioni to oppose her assumption of
ihe r<-ins ef government and this fact
will influence her decision Ujion the prop
osition of the several nations that the
i.mper->r return tÂ«t Peking.
The State Department has been in
formed that a report is current in Shang
hai that the Imperial family is to retire
further inland. ;md this is considered not
unlikely in view of the laci that to the
Kmpress L>o\vager the Kmpt-ror is. to
quote hisn officials, "hor most valuable
asset." Through Minister Wu and othti
Chinese officials this Government and Eu
rope are endeavoring to bring about llio
iÂ«turn lo Peking Â°f ttwong Hsu. Should
these cfTon? be successful it is proposed
lo surround him with a progressive cabi
r.et and ur;d<-r the protection of tht- pow
ers it is believed hf will be able to in
telligently administer the affairs of his
country and (Â¦Â¦imply with the demands the
foreign nations will make.
While the danger of a br^ak. among the j
powers is still present the action of CJer- i
many in withdrawing: from tlv position j
j-^he had assumed of insisting upon the i
surrender of the authors of the outrages {
r.s a condition prr-codem to negotiation is i
regardci as a pood augury of continued '
harmony. It is regarded as even more j
important than the note presented by thc
rrc nch Government and indorsed by Rus
tia.
The President -will call a meeting or j
his Cabinet for next Tuesday, when tin-
French note will be carefully discussed
and the policy of the United States will |
be determined. There are several feat
ure? of the French note, notably that â¢
requiring the razing of the Taku fortiu- i
cation? and interdiction of the importa- '
tion cf munitions of war into China, to j
which this Government cannot agree.
However, its declination to do so will m^ |
disturb the concert of the powers. Ofli- |
f';;'..Â« fay ihat if other powers desire lo i
take action of this character the Unileo j
8tau-s. if it cannot dissuade them, will j
not oppose it. An official who Is thorough
ly familiar with the views of the Pr'-si- '
<lert and Secretary Hay said to-day that I
thÂ«= reply of this Government to the j
French note will be based upon the note j
of Secretary Hay. dated July 3. It w*H i
insist first upon the punishment of the |
responsible authors of the outrages.; sec- !
ond. upon grounds which will prevent a I
recurrence of such disasters; third, ihe |
protection of all rights guaranteed to i
friendly powers by treaty and jnterna- '
tional law. and fourth, a recognition ui j
the principle of the "open door." One ol j
the most important duties which Minister
Oinger will be called upon to perform in
the preliminary negotiations he is to con
duct will be to examine the credentials
with which Prinze <"hinp. I.i Hung Chans
and other Chinese commissioners are su;>- j
plied. Sir Oaude Macdonald. the Brilis'.i
Minister, ha? been given discretionary au
thority to begin preliminary negotiations.
This Govornir.Â«nt does not propose to

ASSAILED BY THE WOMEN.
Eight Italians Stoned While Going
to Work in a Colliery.
HAZLKTON, Pa., Oct. 5.â IOight Ital
ians, employed on the night shift of the
Calvin Pardee & Co.'s colliery, at Latti
mer, were attacked on the way to Holy
road early this morning by 100 women,
mostly Hungarians and Italians from
MJlnesrille. A few women with clubs were
arrested, but moÂ«t of them carried stones
In their aprons. The eight Italians saw
the women on the road ahead ol them and
crossed the field to avoid them. The
women a!Â«?o crossed the field and, over
taking the men. hurled stones at them.
The men ran and were soon out of the
reach of the women. One man received a
severe cut on the head, while several oth
ers were struck by stones.
There was to have been a march of
women and men from McAdoo and Jcans
ville to L;it timer early this morning, but
inr some reason it was called off at mid
night. It may be made to-morrow.
Some of the foreigners are showing an
ugly disposition. They are seen in greater
numbers on the highways, and as some
of them carry clubs a collision between
them and the coal and iron policemen
may occur at almost any time. There is
no material change to-dav in the number
of men at work in this region.

HERMANN SPEAKS IN IDAHO.
BOISE, Idaho, Oct. 5.â Hon. Binger Her
mann, Commissioner of the General Land
Office, addressed a largo meeting here this
evening. The meeting was one of the best
held during the campaign and the ad
dreps was very well received.
Mr. Hermann prefaced his address with
some remarks eulogistic of Senator Shoup.
He spoke of the Senator's early career, of
the work he had done years ago in at
tracting attention to Idaho and of the
manner in which he had looked after Ida
ho's interests at Washington. The speak
er expressed the hope that the Senator
would be returned.
On the silver issue Mr. Hermann said
the public would hear iess and le?s of it
as the campaign progressed. Croker. he
said, had t<">ld Bryan he could not carry
New York unless he should drop 15 to 1,
and Croker's advire is being followed. For
that reason, the speaker said, "Mr. Bryan
came up to the captain's office and set
tled." Taking up the subject of Imperial
ism Mr. Hermann asked if any Democrat
knew a Republican who de^irod to change
our form of government. He challenged
any Democrat to name a single Republi
can who entertained any such desire. If
there was not, one, as he claimed, how
could the party, which is composed cf in
dividuals. stand for such a policy as the
Democrats allege?
Mr. Hermann dwelt at much lenprth on
the benefit that retention of the Philip
pines will be to the Pacific Coast. He said
we should hold the islands first, because
it was our duty to educate and otherwise
benefit these people, and second, because
it wfli be of enormous benefit to us com
mercially. He pave statistics showing
what benefit had already accrued to our
Orients*! trade and said it was necessary
for the West to cultivate the market In
the Kar East and that for this purpose
retention of the Philipoines was very es
sential.
HANNA AND ICE INCIDENT.
CHICAGO, Oct. 5.â Senator Hanna made
merry to-day over the stories about "the
attempt to assassinate him." He J=aid:
"The facts are as follows: After I had
done speaking and was sitting down lis
tening to Congressman Mann a piece of
ice about as big as your closed flst struck
the corner of the table in front of me and
fell to the floor of the Platform. I paid
no attention to It, thinking some one had
upset the water pitcher and the Ice hai
fallen out. I looked up and saw a hole in
the top of the tent, through which the
chunk of ice had evidently come.
'.'That It was thrown at me Is nonsense,
as In order to do that a man would have
had to climb on top of the tent, and it
would not bear one's weight. What prob
ably happened was that some mischievous
boy. seeir.g the piece of ice on the side
walk outside and the convenient hole at
the top of the tent, could not resist the
temptation and tossed it throuffh. it
could not have beon aimed at any one
however, as whoever threw it in could
not have seen any one Inside.
"The stories about it weighing five or
ten pounds are ridiculous. I paid no at
tention to the Incident at the time and
have not thought about it since."
Denies the Kingman Story.
CHICAGO, -Oct. 5â Lulu D. Hay of
Jacksonville. 111., has sent to Senator
Jones, chairman of the Democratic Na

dormant la the grain of. wheat, as thÂ© flash, of

did not of Itself create a new burden nor Im

years preparing, and the Saab. oÂ£ Dewey'a gana
simply revealed them.
Destiny works In a mysterious way Its won

what is forglns In the workshop of Fate.
Behind the curtain oi the future to-morrow
waits, holding la its hands tho unexpected and
the Inevitable, toward which the unerring and
Irresistible magnet of Fata hurries tha nations.
This nation did not anticipate the outcome
of Its war with Spain. The Antilles and not
the Philippines centered Its attention. The
liberating of tha Cubans and not the civiliz
ing of the Filipinos was the duty we under
took, tha burden we assumed.
Likewise neither 'Washington, Lincoln nor
McKinley anticipated the great things they
were to do nor the responsibilities they were
to assume, nor did they dream of the oppor
tunities that were to knock at their doors.
But each one proved himself to be a well
chosen child of destiny In be in? equal to hia
opportunity when It came, to be a "man of
mighty days, and equal to the days."
My fellow citizens, I believa that we will ba
trua to our traditions, ever watchful of cur
liberties and of the rights of others committed
to our care, loyal to our flag and all that It
represents. I am confident that In the future
we will not change in. sturdiness of character
or uprightness of purpose, but will continue
to grow la wealth and power so that as ara
our tasks, so shall our strength be. and that wa
wl:l ever be a light set upon a hill, an ex
emplar and leader among nations.
I believe that we will be equal to our new
opportunities, that we will do our duty in this
new sphere of national and International Ufa"
In which It has pleased God to place us^ and
that, under the leadership of William McKin

no uncertain tread, meeting our new obliga
tions as fearlessly, resolutely and successful
ly as our revolutionary fathers met theirs
when they founded this republic.
Great nations must bear great burdens. That
Is what makes them great. Our nation did
not consciously s^ek this Oriental burden. But
we have this burden to bear, this responsibil
ity to fulfill, this duty to perform. We have
never yet shrunk from a danger, m*glected an
obligation or failed In a task. We will not
clo^e the century with an act of cowardice o*
an admission of lncompÂ«tency.

Mr. Bryan, in quoting very often from the
speeches of Abraham Lincoln, would make It
appear that he is attempting to follow In the
footsteps of the martyred President. In this
regard President McKinley very pertinently
says: "If our opponents would practice as
well as preach the doctrines of Abraham Lin
coln there would be no fear for the safe
ty of our Institutions at home or
their rightful Influence In any territory over
which our flag floats." In this regard Presi
dent McKinley can very appropriately refer
Mr. Bryan to Lincoln's first Inaugural address
wherein he said, "The power confided to me
will be used to held, occupy and possess the'
minded soldier boy who deserts while I must
not touch a hair of a wily agitator who In
duces him to desert? This Is none the less
Injurious when effected by getting a father,
or mother, or friend Into a public meeting and
there working upon his feelings until he Is
persuaded to write the soldier boy that he Is
fighting in a bad cause, for a wicked adminis
tration of a contemptible government. I think
that. In such a case, to silence the agitator and
save the boy Is not only constitutional, but
withal a great mercy." Â¦.:';'/Â¦:
Senator Fettlcrew of South Dakota has been
a very bitter opponent of the President In his
Philippine policy, and Is now an advocate cf
Bryan's election
and his own. One ? +
of these rath
era to whom Lin- Such Treason
coin referred re
cently wrote the Encourages
following letter to
the Senator in re- the Rebellion,
ply to his appeal
for aid In this + +
campaign. I com
mend this letter to Mr. Bryan's consideration.
It Is as follows:
"You ask for the active -assistance of your
'friends' to overcome the efforts of the Re
publicans to defeat you. Your friends are
mostly In the island of Luzon, and one of my
sons U now suffering from the tortures of a
Mauser bullet sent into his chest by one of
them. Your boasted friends are the enemies
of our country, and are thriving on the en
couragement and support derived from you
as Senator from South Dakota. I had two
sons in the Philippine rebellion, and your politi
cal consort. Judge Moore, prayed that the
god of battles would strengthen the arm of
their opponents, that they might drive these
sons and their comrades into the sea. This
sentiment you have countenanced and encour
aged by your every public act, and It Is because
of your having thus countenanced and encour
aged such treason that the rebellion in the
Philippines still hanss on.".
â¢'NEXT A A TO COMMERCIAL TAU-UKE^
It Is said of McKinley as It was said of Lin
coln, that he holds Ms car close to the ground
keeping step to the rhythm of the people's
tread. This Is a grand rhythm, second to none
but that to vrhtch the -stars keep time; It Is

the door through which this nation will march
to a grandeur yet unknown, and proclaimed to
the llstenln.tr nations that the United States
has taken Its rightful place on the right of the
line of the worH powers, and that Its flag, alike
In the Orient and the Occident. Its red. white
and blue flashing equally In the light of the set
ting and the rising sun, means everywhere th-Â»
Urhtenlnc of man's burdens, the lifting up of
God's people.
Lincoln unlocked the manacles of the slave,
made the bondman free and cemented In blood
these diverse sovereignties Into * Union one
and indivisible, now and forever.
Washington brought order out of chaos,
united the disunited pioneers of freedom, and
laid plumb and true the cornerstone of the
grandest political edifice ever reared by the
hand of man. this temole of liberty sheltering
for nil time government of the people, by the
people and for the people.
William McKinley Is one of the three great
presidents whose names shall be remembered
throughout all time, and whose administrations
mark the three great epochs the history of
this nation.

I believe that, as President McKinley has
said, we will by our treatment of the Filipinos
lead them to feel that it Is their liberty and
not our power, their welfare and not our gala
that we seek to enhance, and that, as our flag
has never waved over any community save In
blessing, they will acknowledge that" It has
not lost Its gift of benediction by its world
wide Journey to their shores.
I believe that we will show them how to
govern under laws that we will teach them
that office Is a public trust, power a shield for
Justice and not a weapon for personal prowess,
and Dublic moneys a means of public bene
faction and not of personal aggrandisement.
I believe that under the aegis of our Gag. law
and order will drive out anarchy and brigand
age. Industry and education eradicate- vaga
bondage and Illiteracy, sanitation drive out
disease, and that from the acorn of American
civilization sown by us In these Islands there
will grow the mighty oak of self-government
whose branches will shelter them and their de
scendants henceforth and forever.
ful of their own
Interests, they have poured out their blood and
treasure In defense of the rights of others. I
do not believe that all of a sudden. In tho
twinkling of ah eye, they have changed In
character, purpose, ambition, courage or de
termination. I do not believe that a. people
who besan a. war to rescue the Cubans from
oppression can end It by oppressing the Fili
pinos. I do not believe that we will establish
In thf Philippines a government different In
principle from our own. though different la

Mr. McKinley predicted that Republican
success would mean prosperity In place o* pov

wealth at home, honor and respect abroad.
McKlrlcy was fleeted, and all the fog and

indorsed Bryanism, I air. opposed to the Dem
ocratic party.
In this campaign we have the unusual op
portunity of comparing th? two candidates by
the promises made by McKlnley four years
Â«goÂ° and their fulfillment, and by the predic
tions made then by Bryan and their non
fulSllmer.t
A very gifted American orator once delivered
a lecture vrhich he entitled "The Mistakes of
Moses." This evening I propose to speak of
the "Mistakes of Bryan."
We aJl know that hindsight Is more reliable
than fores!iht, and that It is easier to be a
historian than a prophet, yet we also know
thtt there always must be prophets, leaders,
guides, whose duty It is to point the way, and
whore skill to guiJe must be in cronortion to
their ability to profit by their own experience
or the experience- of others. Of what avalleth
the lessons of yesterday if they help us not in
meeting the Inevitable to- morrow?
Judged by this standard Mr. Bryan has
shown himself little, adapted to lead or guide
the reople. In 1836 he did not point out a
road for us to travel that would not have led
to disaster, and even', road that he desig
nated as dangerous has led the people In safe
ty to the land of prosperity they so eagerly and
so Ion* had sought. In the language of Presi
dent McKlr.'.py. "The prophet of evil no longer
commands confidence, because he has been
pro-. en to be a false prophet."
A country on the double basis of gold and
silver, with the free and unlimited coinage of
Â¦Utct at the ratio of 36 to 1, necessarily will
become a country with a silver basis alone, as
witness Mexico and China. A country on the
double basis of gold nr.d silver, with a limited
CMr.p.Ke of silver at the ratio of 15 to 1, is on
a gol<l basis, and it gets its share of the world's

ness brings to it. We have the satisfaction of
knowing that of all the nations the United
Slates attracts and holds thÂ» largest stock of
gold because the volume of its business trans

that every rarer or silver dollar Is exchange

Mr. Bryan is very fond of quoting from the
speeches of Abraham Lincoln. I would sug
gest to him that when he calls the suppression
cf the Filipino insurrection an unholy and un
just wax, knowir.c that his words will reach
alike the ear of the Fllinlno rebel and of the
American soldier, as they scan each other along
the barrels of their loaded rifles, he quote the
following appropriate remarks of Abraham Lin
coln, aimed at such orators as he:
Think of that, Mr. Bryan
"President McKinley* Â¦ proclamation to the
people of the Philippines!, through General Otis,
ought to secure the hearty co-operation in our
work of regeneration. The President promises
them all they hoped to win In their revolt
against Frain. President McKinley promises
that civil and municipal government shall be
carried on as far as practicable by officers
chosen from the Inhabitants of the islands and
if. In performing this work of civilization,
American blood should be shed, the position
of our anti-expansionists would not be enviable.
The first shot fired against the American flag
would make domestic opposition to the meas
ures of our Government overt treason."
I would commend to his thoughtful considera
tion the following statement made by the New
York Journal before the ratification^ of the
treaty:
Which will the American people believe?
The man who gave his life for his country, or
the man who gives only his Jaw,, and cares
not how many of our soldiers lives are sacri
ficed ujon the altar of his selfish ambition?
"If I am shot by a Filipino bullet It might
as well come from one of my own men, be
cause I know that the continuance of fighting
here is due to reports sent out from America."

or the man in the rear?

of his troops as brilliant, as gallant a soldier,
as brave a man, as true a patriot as ever any
nation called a hero, and this people and gen

days before he was killed on the field of bat
tle by a Filipino bullet:

knows what would have been done by us?
We give nothing under fire. No, Mr. Bryan,
there was but one course for Mr. McKinley
to take after Aguinaldo had fired on our flag,
and the Senate had so ratified the treaty, and
that course he took and is now pursuing, and
the American people will cry out Jn no un
certain tone, "Well done, good and faithful
servant." â¢
In his Indianapolis speech Mr. Bryan said:

for Â«very drop of blood drawn from an Ameri

ended, but with
no additional laurels on Colonel Bryan's brow
and he looked around for an opportunity to
get into the procession. The band wagon with
McKinley and Roosevelt and Dewey and Samp
son and Schley and Shatter and "Wood and
Lawton and Chaffee and MacArthur aboard
had gone by, but there was still a chance tj
get in at the head of the second division,
which he hoped would be remembered best
because It was seen last. The treaty of Paris
acknowledging the Independence of Cuba and
cedlns to us Porto Rico. Guam and the Philip
pines was before the Senate for ratification.
There was danger of its defeat. The leading
Democratic papers were bursting from ex
pansion. The hour for a great coup had coma
and Eryan was the man for the hour. Here
was a chance to become marshal of the sec
ond division of the parade. To see the op
portunity was to grasp It and the Nebraska
colonel doffed his uniform and hied him, at
his own request, to Washington to save the
treaty. According to his enlistment hi3
duty was with his regiment. Accord-
Ing to his ambition his fluty was In
Washington. Before the vote was taken
on the treaty the Filipinos had succeeded in
bringing about a. clash of arms with the Amer
ican army, and while the vote was being taken
they were shooting at our flag arid our sol
diers. That should have been Mr. Bryan' j
signal for opposing the treaty if he was then
in favor of an immediate promise of Independ
ence to the Filipinos. He knew that the treaty
ceded Porto Rico and the Philippine Islands
absolutely to the United States; that it pro
vided that the United States should pay $20,-
OCO.CCO for the Philippine Islands: that the in
dependence of Cuba was guaranteed, and not
the independence of either Porto Rico or the
Philippines, but that on the contrary It was
provided that "the civil rights* and political
status of the native Inhabitants of the terri
tories hereby ceded to the United States shall
be determined by the Congress."
He knew that we could not, with any pride
or self-respect, adopt the treaty and thereby
accept sovereignty and then yield this sov
ereignty to those firing on our flag:. He knew
that we must and that we would put down
the insurrection before we would talk of the
Independence of the insurgents. He knew that
we had never voluntarily given independence
to the native Inhabitants of any territory ever
acquired by us. and that none could force us
to give that which we had determined It was
our right to control. Knowing all this he still
advocated, and, more than any other man,
secured the ratification of the treaty. With
out his aid it would have been defeated. When,
therefore, he says that "that party is respon
sible for the shedding of American blood in
the Philippines that waÂ« responsible for a
treaty that made free men of Cubans and tried
to make vassals of the Filipinos," the people
will point the finger at him at exclaim,
â¢â¢Thou art the man."

The American people know that the payment
of one set of coupons in silver would be an
earnest of what is to come, and It would there
fore Jeopardize the credit of this Government
and this people, and Immediately loans would
become difficult. Investments would stop, pay
ments would be enforced, manufacturing would
be suspended or curtailed and U1IÂ«- working
men would curse the cry of imperialism that
was used to blind them to the real dangers of
Bryanism.
Industry, commerce and enterprise are based
on credit, and credit is based on confidence,
and when confidence Is destroyed credit dies,
and confidence would be destroyed by the elec
tion of Bryan, pledged to destroy the gold
standard, pledged to act independently of all
other nations in establishing our financial pol
icy, pledged to take the United States from the
front rank of the nations that do ninety-five
per cent of the world's business and place it
with these that now do only fK-e per cent,
pledged to substitute free trade for protec
tion, pledged to unsettle everything, to intro
duce confusion where now Is order, uncer
tainty where now is certainty, the silence of
Idleness where now Is heard the busy hum of
industry, the crowded souphousi for the futl
dinner pail, to place an Altgeld on the Supreme
Bench, a Tillrr.an In the Cabinet, to turn over
to Aguinaldo, with his pockets lined with the
traitor's gold and his hands red with the blood
of our soldiers, the trust we agreed In sisht of
God and man faithfully ourselves to fulfill.

this could not remedy the evil of his election.

gone by. Alaska was acquired in 1SS7 under no
such promise, and she has just obtained local
government. Its admission as a Territory and
the admission of Arizona and Xew Mexico as

In the | meantime we have given Porto Rico a

of all this, what Is the difference In principle

from the path that Lincoln trod as did the
path of Robespierre diverse from that of
Washington. â¢ â¢ â¢
He knows that no man under the American
Government is liable to be deprived of trial
by Jury through government by injunction or
by anything else except by the anarchy he,
Bryan, is inciting. He knews the province of
the writ of injunction, to wit: To prevent the
doing or continuing of an act that would cause
damage that no court of law in its usual course
can redress, such as the infringement of a pat
ent right, of a copyright, of a trademark, the
polluting or shutting off of water, the commis
sion of waste, the conspiring of tradesmen or
manufacturers or railroads in violation of the
interstate commerce act 01 of striking laborers
to prevent by force commerce by rail between
the States or the transportation of the mails.
He knows that this preventive remedy has been
applied alike to employer and employe; that it
broke up the combination of railroads to con
trol the traffic between the Missouri and the
Pacific and the combination of coal dealers In
this city to keep up the price of coal as well
as the combination of Debs and his associates
to stop the running of trains. He knows that
it Is a contempt of court to disobey Its writs,
whether of Injunction or otherwise: that court j
must have the summary power to mete out
immediate punishment fcr such disobedience;
that without such power courts might as weil
close their doors and the judicial ermine give
place to the redcoat of anarchy, the woolsack
to the guillotine. He knows that the railroad
officials and coal dealers would have been pun
ished by fine and Imprisonment if they had
disobeyed the Injunctions issued against them.
He knows that the striking workingmen defied
the mandates of the courts and were punished
solely for such disobedience, as courts have
done under the wisest Judges since English law
was known, and he knows that such punish
ments have not in the least impaired to any
man the right of trial by Jury.
Mr. Bryan is a lawyer. He knows the consti
tution of the United States and of every State.
He knows that the right of trial by Jury is
guaranteed in every constitution drawn by the
Anglo-Saxon race since the Magna Charta and
that no human power desires to or can take it
away from the humblest pauper that begs for
alms upon our public s:reets.
"If he is a wage-earner, and you do not know
how soon he may be e\en If he Is not now. Is
he safe when he Is llablo to be deprived of trial
by Jury through the system known as gov
ernment by injunction?"
Mr Bryan was, therefore, dishonest in so us
ing Lincoln's great nama to fan the flame
of discord between wage-earners and wage
payers. This dishonesty was again apparent
in a subsequent speech, wherein he said:
ltableness.
Lincoln was essentially a man of the peo
ple and his treat human h<?art had room In It

"* â¢?Â¦ trynien, rich and
_, _ . . poor alike, and his

and not of envy.
4 ?Â¦ hatred and unchar-
Lincoln was the last man to attempt to
mount ambition's ladder upon the rungs made
of class dissension and internecine strife. He
recognized the catholicity of labor, the respect
due to honest toll, the interdependence of labor
and capital, the protection due to employer and
employe alike, and he voiced this sentiment In
that part of this message which Mr. Bryan
omitted to quote. He said: "Labor Is prior
to and independent of capital. Capital Is only
the fruit of labor and could never have existed
if labor had not first existed. Labor la the
superior of capital and deserves much the
higher consideration. Capital has Its rights,
which are as worthy of protection as other
rlchts."
property and places belonging: to the Govern
ment." Bryan's footsteps point in an oppo
site direction. He has pledged himself. If
elected, to call an extra session of Congress
to give up some of the territory of the United
States. But Mr. Bryan does not preach ttie
doctrines of Lincoln. He garbles Lincoln's
utterances and gives them a meaning Lincoln
never Intended, and, therefore. I do not think
him honest. In his quotation from Lincoln In
his Labor day speech at Chicago he made It ap
pear that Lincoln apprehended that an attempt
would be made to place the dollar above the
man. and that thereby the liberties of the
people would be destroyed by capital. The
quotation reads as if taken bodily from Lin
coln's first annual message to Congress. In
stead. It is made up of disconnected sentences
taken here and there from a message that was
discussing the monarchical tendencies of the
slave States, was contrasting the slave labor
in the South and the hired laborer In the
North, the hopelessness of the former and the
independence and helpfulness of the latter, but
which In no way was colored by any such de
moralizing rhetoric as that which Bryan at
tempted to ~lve to It.
SCENE AT METROPOLITAN TEMPLE LAST NIGHT, WHEN HORACE G. PLATT MADE TRENCHANT COM
PARISONS BETWEEN* BRYANISM AND REPUBLICANISM. TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE LATTER. HIS
SPEECH MET WITH GREAT APPLAUSE.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 6, 1900.
oi ever? oiner naucn.
The Silver convention with like Porullstlc
passion was alFo captured by the rhetoric of
this man's croÂ«s of rold.
The Kepubllcans answered all thl3 political
and financial madness with a platform that
stood for *our.d. lior.est money, for an Inde
pendent Judiciary, for protection to American
industries, for union ar.d not for disunion, for
peace and prosperity and not for disaster and
Cissonslon. and upon this platform they placed
William McKinley.
Bryan predicted that the going out of his
ctr.g with bitterness Grover Cleveland, the onlj
Democrat -who hail led them to success since
1S06. ar.d who was in integrity of character,
nobility of purpose. In fearlessness and forti
tude cne of the greatest Americana and the
natural erwmy of the Altgeldfi and Bryans and
Tillmans. read him out of the party and, with
nlm Thomas Jefferson, threw all their teach
ing? after them and Installed in their stead
the Boy Orator from the fiatte. William Jen
nings Hryan, who mistook Bryanism for Pop
ulism and called It Democracy. They sent h!m
nbroad as a Populistic aspirant for the Presi
dency and authorized him to preach class dis
tinctions, to etir up bitterness on the part of
the many who had not acainst the few who
then had. to cry out against the fortunate, the
frugal, the prudent, the successful, to put a
premium on failure nr.d a discount on suc
cess, to threaten the independence of the Judi
ciary, to lm-ite the people to financial dishonor
and certain bankruptcy, to contradict every doc
trine of economics ar.d to endeavor to bring
about a financial impossibility, the stability
of the double standard of gold ard silver at a
fixed arbitrary ratio of 1C to 1, independently
Mr. Platt made the following address,
â¢u hich was closely listened to by the ap
preciative audience:
Ladies ar.d Ger.t'.en-.en: All my life I have
b-'-n a. Democrat. After mature reflection I
have determined to publicly change my politi
co! affiliation, and this evening I cake this
public confession at the faith that is In me.
I am opposing the Democratic par
ty because it is now radical, revolu
tionary, impractical and populistic,
and because its present aspirations
are a menace to the welfare of the
country.
I am supporting 1 the Republican
party because it is conservative, prac
tical, progressive and creative, and
because its success at this election is
necessary to tbe continuance of pros
perity.
I am ipavir.s the Democratic party because
that party has dethroned Jefferson, the man of
thought, the statffir.a3. the philosopher, who
b*!i*rve<! in sound mcrwry and territorial expan
t-irr., ard has enthroned Eryaa, the man of
tors to the End.
The Speaker Easily Held His Audi-
PLATT'S ELOQUENT ADDRESS.
Câ^^ HATORS have come out of
Ik ** e East since the? opening
JM of the political campaign, but
Q San Frane'sco may say with
W pride mat a favorite son of
Jr ii^r own has excelled them
all. The ?pr<*ch delivered by
Horace G. Piatt at Metropoli
tan Temple last night, in <i!ctfon. in beau
tiful imagery, in pure eloquence. In clean
cut logic, in trenchant and comprehenFlve
treatment of the entire political situation,
outclassed all the addresses that preceded
It. BetrabUaui and Democratic.
The speaker occupied an hour and three
quarters m Its deiix'erj-. Frequent ap
pease interrupted him! Indeed, in por
tions of the address cheers punctuated al
most every sentence and followed surely
after every paragraph.
The audicr.ee. which fi'ied every seat
and occuplei all standing room around
the walls and well down the aisles, was
different from that present at the usual
campaign rally. Merchants and manufac
turers, attorneys physicians, clubmen and
society men were there, desirous of hear
ing San Francisco's lamed after-dinner
fpeaker â reared in an atmosphere of J<?f
fersonian Democracy â turn his eloquence
to the support of McKinley. Fashionably
dressed women were plentiful in the au
dience. ar.d the workinsmen and their
Â¦wives and daughters were well represent
ed. On the whole, the audience resembled
that which gathers at the annual lnter
collc-glate debate rather than the crowd
attracted by the ordinary political rally.
Albert Gerberding presided, and after
three songs by a quintet in Rough Rider
uniforms, he spoke as follows:
"I hcjK? that all of you are good Demo
crats and come here peeking reformation.
Mr. Platt's presence here to-night is uus
to the fact that love of couritrj- Is greater
and better than party fealty. It i3 lay
pleasar.t duty to introduce him to you."
It will take time to eradicate from our Island
possessions the evil effects of centuries of Span
ish misrule. For some time we must la the
Philippines sustain the law with visible force
until confidence la bred of Justice, and the hus
bandman learns that he will reap what he sows,
unmolested by native brigand or Governmental
bandit. This will require a standing army. A
great hue and cry is raised against a large
standing army, and from the pages of history
are culled the bloody records that standing
armies have Imprinted there of their onslaughts
upon the lives and liberties of the people. His
tory, like the Bible, can be used to prove any
crime or virtue, that human fears or hopes may
conceive. But history Is but an Incomplete and
Inaccurate narrative of the past. It tells noth

next are to produce the soldiers for our army.

tric club swinging â something new in this
line. Besides, the San 'Francisco Rushers
and the Athens of Oakland, the crack
basket-ball teams of the coast, will play
two 20-minute halves, and as there is
quite a rivalry between these two teams
the usual fierce and stubborn contest may
be expected. The programme will com
mence sharply at 8 o'clock.
BASKET BALL G0ME v
FOR LADIES* NIGHT
This will be the baseball clash of the
yearâ Sacramento and San Francisco with
but a few inches separating them In the
standing. Ever since the very beginning
of the season the Senators have been the
leading team of the. league. Two months
ago the "pretzel" brigade. Hank Harris'
nine diamond scrapers, began to fill with
microbes of action, and from last In the
list they moved upward, and now they
are within whispering distance of the
champions.
Last week San Francisco and Sacra
mento played a series of two games In
Sacramento, with honors divided in the
middle. This series will be for three
matches, two on the local diamond and
one in Oakland, Sunday morning. Two
victories for Frisco out of the three means
the lead: otherwise, the "champs" â¢will
stay where they are and give the old-time
grin to Hank Harris. A year ago about
this time the same conditions prevailed,
the same teams being in the same rela
tive positions. Then the Senators Intro
duced a few wise measures into their pol
icy and the local team was outdistanced.
A big lead at present for Sacramento
would in all probability decide the
championship of 1900, and then there
would be more local tears shed by fanat
ics. At any rate, this series will produce
whirls of excitement and every kind of
noise known to and practiced by the fa
natic. Last year at this stage of the sea
son the grounds were packed with vocif
erating enthusiasts. There is every prom
ise that as much noise will be generated
this Saturday and Sunday.
"Hank" Harris will try Iburg in Satur
day's game. Sunday morning Fireman
Fltz will play the hose on the Oakland
grounds, and should Iburg show good
form on Saturday he will also step on the
slab Sunday afternoon. Among the re
serves Harris holds Knell, Â¦who may be
called into service." Iburg has been any
thing but unsolvable of late. In fact, the
opposing teams have been fixing their
hitting "lamps" upon his delivery with
direful effects. Doyle will twirl to-day
for the Senators. Devereaux in the morn-
Ing game at Oakland and Hughes Sunday
afternoon on the local grounds.
The teams will line up:

The freshman team Is slowly recovering
from its recent slump and will meet the
Mount Tamalpais team on the campus
next Saturday afternoon. Fewer men
have been out for places than formerly.
This is accounted for by the fact that
the management is werdJng out those in
special standing that eligible men may
have all the training possible.
The next game for which the first team
Is scheduled is with the San Jose Normal
on the San Jose grounds next Thursday.
Coach Yost started the training table
Thursday with fifteen men. More will be
added as the season advances, which will
be rapid if the present snappy weather
continues.
Several changes have been made in the
line men. Lee, formerly center, has been
moved out to tackle, taking Burnett's
place, who Is temporarily out of the game
on account of a severely twisted knee.
Emerson, a second eleven man* of * much
promise, is betng tried at the snap-back
place. The wise "ones are prophesying
that when Burnett does go back into the
game it will be as center. Allen, Mc-
Kadden. Nourse and Cooper are out for
end with chances in the order named.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 5.â
Improvement lias marked the work of. the
varsity squad during the past week. In
the game against the Reliance team
Saturday the cardinal aggregation proved
to be a strong one, though a large
score was not recorded in their favor.
From the standpoint of individual ability,
however, the showing was encouraging.
Seetejr and Slaker were given an oppor
tunity to nrove their football prowess,
much to the satisfaction of the coaches.
A.= an aggressive lineman and ground
gainer It is doubtful if Seeley will have
an equal on the coast this season. Slaker
is fast, runs low and hits a line like a
battering ram. When supported by the
rest of the team the sturdy little Chl
cagoan can be depended upon for material
gains. The work of Hill and Fisher at
halves was a surprise to all. Hill's long
*-nd runs and fierce tackle smashes mark
ed him for varsity honors, while Fisher
showed improvement over last season's
work both in advancing the ball and
backing up the line.
The line-uÂ» for to-mcrrow is as fol
1ot.-f: Left end. Braley; left tackle, Al
brrtson; left guard. Clay; center, Corn
ish; right guard. Luce: right tackle,
Pringle: right end. Womble: quarter-back.
More: left half. Duden; right half, Smith;
full-back, Fautz.
The individual make-up of the team is
anything but final. Aside from the five
veterans. Smith, Womble, Pringle. Corn
ish and Clay, no other places in the <-leven
are at all sure. It is because of this
fact that the frequent changes in the
line-up during the game of to-morrow will
be noted and compared with unusual
interest. Braley has been given first
chance at Ihe vacant end, but his work
there has been only ordinary, and either
Hudson, Dibblee or Starr may take his
place soon. Albcrtson plays a fairly
steady game at taÂ«kle, but his rivals,
Hansen. Castlthun and Stowe, are plav-
Jng just as good, if not better ball. A
change in the line-up here is inevitable.
It is clear that one guard will have to be
lilled by a green man this year; and the
development of the best man for the place
is causing considerable interest. Luce, a
liut-'ky and rather insignilicant substitute
last year, "has been playing on. the Varsity
this Reason. Overall. Hendrjcks and Van
Valer. though new men. are playing close
up to him -and will force him to Â¦ work
harder to hold his place.
The question of backs is, causing the
most anxiety. All the material for half
backs is comparatively light. Duden,
the heaviest and strongest man. has been
Kiven lirst chance and leads the bunch
by a narrow margin. The two star fresh
men, Sherman and Whipple. have a splen
did chance for the position when they cor
rect Eome dangerous crudities in their
play. Mini. KaÂ«-dingr and Promo are all
playing good ball. Fautz will be full
back if he keeps his present lead over his
ri\-als. He punts, runs, bucks and kan
garoos in good style, but is by no means
up to Kaarsberg's high standard. More
can outplay- him. but is i>< iiir tried at
quarter back â at present the weakest po
sition in the team. If. as now seems prob
able. McLean or Decoto should play the
position better, More will be returned to
full-back.
BERKELEY. Oct. 5.â The University of
California eleven, which will be pitted
against the Reliance team to-morrr.w
should have no difficulty in beating the
clubmen by a larger score than Stan
ford's last Saturday. Coach Kelly has
kept the same men playing togrther
steadily through the week, with the re
pult that a creditable amount of team
work has been developed. The backs are
light, but the line is heavy.
WHEELMEN PLANNING
FOR CLUB TOURS
The Bay City Wheelmen will hold a
big smoker at their clubhouse, 441 Golden
Gate avenue, Saturday evening, October
27, George B. Stangenberger is chairman
of the committee of arrangements.
After several years of inactivity, the
result of an accident. Colonel Ralph de
Clalrmont, the pioneer bicycle rider of
the Pacific Coast and the second to own a
wheel In America, can once more be seen
among the ranks of the early morning
wheelmen. The colonells now 70 years of
ape, but in spite of the weight of time on
his back iis quite a notable figure on ac
count of his erect seat and skillful man
agement of his iron horse.
The California Associated Cyclists will
revive the annual 10-nule road race which
was such a feature of cycling several
years ago. It will be held from Fruit
vale to Haywards Sunday, October U.
Captain Thomas G. Spillane of the Olym
pic Wheelmen, chairman of the road rac
ing committee, has the event in charge.
Six members of the California Cycling
Club started to make a century run from
this city to San Jose and return under
seven hours last Sunday and â¢ four fin

A. BarnwAll. 6:44; E. E.Â» Bergman. 6:53:
William Kbmbach, 7. C. Kristensen and
F. Westcott started, but broke down and
could not finish within the time limit.
This is the first club going for the cen
tury under the new time limit- of seven
hours. It used to be seven and a. half
hours.
Alexander E. J. Nye has been elected
captain and he has appointed Edwin Ru
sac Hrst lieutenant and Frank Bollo sec
ond lieutenant. It is the intention of the
club during the coming riding season to
devote a great deal of attention to coun
try runs. One method suggested is to let
each of the eleven directors of the club
name the destination of a run and have
charge of the arrangements. Now that
the club has given up racing every effort
will be made to make the country rides
attractive.

Rowing Club declining to serve as presi
dent for another term W. B. Hlnehman or
the Alameda Boating Club was elected to
that office. II. A. Keeler of the Reliance
Athletic Club wished to resign his double
office of secretary-treasurer, but, was in
duced to continue to perform his duties
for the present at any rate. The com
mittee on the registration of athletes was
elected and consists of J. R. Bockman, II.

The medals given by the semi-centennial
Admission day celebration committee of
the Native Sons of the Golden West and
raced for on September 9 were presented
to the winners or their representatives
last Saturday evening at the committee
rooms in the Palace Hotel.
At the last regular meeting of the Ariel
Rowing Club several new members were
initiated and the fund for building a new
.boathouse was started. The committee
appointed to select a site for the new
quarters of the club has reported favor
ably on a location near the Arctic Oil
Works. To aid-' the building fund a. ball
wiil be given in Union-square Hall toward
the end of next month. Shares or bonds
may be issued, as several members have
promised tb help the fund by taking stock.
As soon as $090 or $700 is secured the work
of building will begin. The house will be
of two or three stories and will contain
a storeroom for boats and oars, a' gym
nasium, danoeroom and lockers and pos
sibly a handball court. Nominations of
officers to serve during the coming year
will be made at the next meeting and
the election will take place in December.
An examination of the members of the
junior barge crew of the Ariels has
proved the fact that the barge did not
round the mark in the race on Admission
day, but passed over it. â¢ '
A dinner will be given at a downtown
restaurant ne.xt Monday evening to thÂ»
Pioneer senior barge crew which won tnÂ»
championship at the last regatta. The
hostess will be Mrs. Muirhead, the late
J. B. Muirhead having been for many
years a member of the Pioneer Rowing
Club and an ardent supporter of rowing.
ARIEL ROWERS PLAN
ENLARGED QUARTERS
The ladies of the San Francisco Golf
Club are about to start a challenge class
similar to the one that has for some tlmo
been in existence at the Oakland, San
tiago and other golf clubs. The opening
game will take place at the Presidio links
to-day, and the places resulting from the
play will give the order of the players.
Once the class is established any lower
number may challenge the number im
mediately above, and if the player hold
ing the lower number beats the one hold
ing the higher she takes her place and the

The standing of the league teams:
For dogs defeated In the first round on
the first day of the stake there win be a
consolation, the prizes for which will
reach 512UO. In the annals of coursin? this
stake is second only to the great English
Waterloo. Jt will easily bo the premier
event in America.
All the trainers of nominated dogs are
busy these days training the hounds for
the great event. For Freedom, J. H.
Rosseter*s unbeaten champion and the
favorite in the stake, met with an
accident In the middle of the
week which will most likely inca
pacitate him from entering the stake
Among the fast ones fancied by the form
players are Curtis' Beacon and Luxor
Flying Fox. Narcissus. Sacramento Bov
and Mayflower. Some lofty guessing will
be necessary to pick the winner.
The Ingleside Coursing Association
seems to have stemmed the tide and
rtfled Itself safe in port. Last week
trconz rumors were afloat that the asso
ciation would withdraw from the game
until either the litigation now pending
reached a finish or the old Ingleside Park
was reopened. But this proved to be
solely rumor. As the stake for to-dav
and to-morrow shows, the San MateÂ©
park is still in full operation
A , 1 San Mateo Park a seventy-two-dog
stake will be run and at Union Park a
nlnety-six-dog stake. Coursing will begin
at both parks upon the arrival of the
10:lo a. m. train.
The lull In coursing circles at present
is not by any means due to Inaction or a
cessation of interest In the game. Ther*Â»
is no jumpy excitement manifested now In
passing events by the leashmen. for their
eyes are turned to the future, the. end of
this month, when the great John Grace
challenge cup stake will bo run at Union
Park.
Sixty-four of the fleetest and strongest
hounds have been nominated for this*
stake. Two payments of ?10 each have
been made, and on the night of the draw
the last payment. $30, will be due. This
makes an entrance fee of $50 for each
nomination, or $3200 entrance money in
all. With what the Interstate Coursing
Association and the Union Park Associa
tion adds to the stake over $7000 In prizes
will be distributed to the winners.

The content showed undevelopment of both teams and all the early
crudities of a first game.
As it was the Jir.<t real game in which the Reliance men found them
pelves their play was comparatively good. During the present work the club
athletes havo been training earnestly and expect to give a much better perform
ance against California to-day. There in good material in the team and it is
slowly but Eurcly developing. The football critic who has cast his eye over the

A. R*. Jackson tried the Point Reyes

his friends.
At Alvarado the shooters were kept

From inside recounts there must have
been an awful siaughter of mallard, teal,
canvasback and sprig in Sacramento
County on Monday last. The members ol
the Del Paso Outing Club, the most prom
inent of the capital city's sportsmen or
ganizations, are still recounting to their
friends weird yarns of the frightful fu
sillading they gave the birds on that
eventful occasion.
WHENEVER two or more duck
shooters get together these
daysâ on the street corner, in
club, bar, cafe or business of
ficeâthe haupy hand is extend
ed and mutual congratulations are ut
tered. Not in many years has there been
such an auspicious opening of the season.
Even the oldest and most grizzled of the
winter shooters cannot bring back to
mind any other year, just like thie. From
north to south; wherever there Is a pond
or marsh suitable for duck feeding, there
birds are to be found. -Returning sports
men say that the birds were so plentiful
that they simply had to stop shooting.
The season opened last Monday, a day
when ordinarily but a few of the shooters
could leave their business affairs for the
sport of the marshes. Tho temptation
was too great, however, and the trains
that left town Saturday and Sunday even
ings were crowded with shooters bound
for the preserves. To-night every train
that passes through the Suisun country
will be packed with duck shooters. All
week long these sportsmen have been
ehating for this day. To the great ma
jority it will be the initial shoot of the
reason.
Sprig, teal and widgeon arc the species
abounding in the marshes at the, present
time. A few mallards have been shot, hut
not enough to count in three figures. The
best shooting reports come from the Sul
sun and Alvarado marshes, where the
birds have been flying very strong. The
rain during the past week will make the
conditions even more favorable than on
the opening day.
Two new eluos began life last Monday
in actionâ the Field and Tule Club, with
grounds at Cordelia, and the. Point Reyes
Sportsmen's Club, which has e-xtensive
hunting and fishing grounds .in Marln
County. The members of both clubs en
joyed the first shoot of the season, bring
ing back to town heavy strings of birds.
The Field and Tule Club gave a house
v.-arming last Saturday evening that last
ed from 6 o'clock until 4 the noxt mom
ing. A many-course dinner was served,
with wine accompaniment. On the Sab

not open until the following day, when
they went at it with a double-barreled

AT CORINTHIAN COVE
LONDON', Oct. Câ Thirty-two contests
took place yesterday in the parliamentary
general election. Mcst of them were In
the rural districts and the results have
not yet been announced. So far as known.
441 members have been declared elected,
and the relative strength of the parties
is as follows: Ministerialists, 301; Lib
erals, 77; Nationalists, CO; I>aborl:es, 3.
In the Straiford and Wldne3 divisions
of Lancashire, Sir John William McClure
and John Saunders Gilllat, who respec
tively represented those constituencies in
the late parliament, have been returned
by the Conservatives with enormously in
creased majorities.
Sir Robert Bannatyne Flnlay, Attorney
General, was re-elected as the Liberal-
Unionist candidate in Invernessburg.
At Maidstone the Liberals secured a
seat, their candidate, J. Parker", receiving
2200 votes as against 2162 cast for his Con
servative opponent, Fienness S. W. Corn
wallls. who represented the district in tho
late parliament.
Thus far the Ministerialists have gained
twenty-three scats and the opposition fif
teen, which will give the Government an
additional sixteen votes on a division in
the House of Common;'.
Last evening Mr. Chamberlain, Secre
tary of State for the Colonies, sent the
following telegram to a candidate:
"Let all patriotic Englishmen remem
ber the words of the Mayor of Mafeking:
'A seat lost to the Unionist government
is a seat gained by the Boers.' "
Government Has Additional
'Votes in Case of a
Division.

STILL GAINING
PARIS, Oct. 5.â The International Peace
Congress epitomized its work In an appeal
to the nations, adopted to-day, in which
the congress condemns the refusal of the
British Government to agree to arbitra
tion or mediation In South Africa, and
expresses keen regret that the majority
of the governments who might have
offered mediation abstained from doing so
In spite of their pacltlc declarations at
The Hague. Regarding China, the con
gress:, after recognizing and pointing out
the primary causes of discontent upon the
part of the Chinese, urges that the solu
tion of the conflict be just and equitable
and in conformity with the inalienable
right of the populations to freely dispose
of themselves.
The congress also characterizes the Ar
menian massacres as the most odious deed
of recent times, and expresses the hope
that the universal indignation of the civ
ilized world will force the governments to
find a radical solution.
Continuing the congress points out the
moral and material Injury resulting from
formidable armaments and recommends
the governments to study those questions
on the solution of which, it is asserted,
depends the prosperity and the very ex
istence of the nations.
The congress then recommends Interna
tional arbitration and urges the conclu
sion of treaties making arbitration perma
nent and obligatory.
It is claimed the congress has thus
placed before the world the basis for a
preliminary study of International differ
ences, as they occur, in order to facili
tate pacific solutions before Irritation
spreads to the ill-informed masses.
Urges All Nations to Make
Arbitration Permanent
and Obligatory.

CALL BUREAU. WELLINGTON HO
TEL. WASHINGTON. Oct. 5.â This Gov
ernment is preparing to take very de
cisive steps. It is learned, with a view to
bringing Turkey to a prompt performance
of its promises and obligations with re
spect to the claims of the Unietd States.
The recall of All Ferrouh Bey. Turkish
Minister, has vastly stimulated interest in
the somewhat strained diplomatic rela
tions with the Sublime Porte ar.d every
step in the negotiations is watched with
keen interest, especially now that it is
possible for the American fleet to be
withdrawn from Eastern waters for a
possible demonstration In the ...editerra
nean.
It was learned to-day from a high offi
cial source that the administration Is of
the opinion that no extreme measures will
be necessary In dealing with the Sultan,
but that It Is prepared to adopt such
measure? if the more usual and gentler
resources of diplomacy are of no effect.
These harsher measures will be. In the
event of th? failure of the present nego
tiations, nothing: less than an ultimatum
which would be presented to the Sultaii
by Minister Oscar S. Straus.
In speaking of this phas* of the situa
tion the official already referred to said:
"Our Government will not cease Its In
sistence upon the payment of these claims
ar.d has detained Mr. 3traus hero pending
the conelus'.ori of these negotiations, an't
unless these negotiations are speedily
concluded In a way entirely satlsfactory
to our Government and la accordance with
the promises made by the Sultan Mr.
Straus will return with very positive in
structions, which will brinp Turkey to
a realization that our Government ex
pects the Sultan to respect ms repeated
promises. "
Government officials here do not believe
that extreme measures will become neces â¢
sary. especially as the Turkish Govern
ment recognizes the bindinp force of its
promises, which have been repeated to tho
United States Charge since -Â»Ir. Straus'
return. The whole of the negotiations
have been difficult ar.d are considered
hlphly creditable to tho State Department
ar.d to the diplomacy and skill of Mr.
Straus.
United States Will Make a
Naval Demonstration,
if Necessary.

one parent. There la no institution in
California devoted exclusively to "half
orphans," but asylums receive such.
OIL CLAIMSâ H. H. S., Brooks. Cal. A
claimant of oil land has to make proof
under the mining laws the same as in
other claims. Several persons can form
a company and bore for oil and that will
be considered as assessment work on
which final proof can be made. The same
rule that applies In placer claims applies
to oil claims. The necessary amount of
assessment work must, be done on each
claim. . Â¦ ' -

nUCH has been said of the importance of trees
to a country from an economic point of view.
The value of the timber they produce and
their usefulness in conserving the water supply are
by this time admitted by all. There is, however, a
further argument on the side of forest protection,
which has been strikingly set forth in a recent num
ber of Health Culture by Dr. Felix L. Oswald; that
of the sanitary value of trees and their effects in
maintaining conditions tending to the healthfulness
of those who live among them.
Dr. Oswald holds that the destruction of forests
is the cause of malaria in many of its forms owing
to the diluvium carried down by torrential streams
from treeless hills and spread over the valleys be
low. In cities trees serve the useful purpose of ab
sorbing noxious gases and generating oxygen. He
notes that in Southern cities like Savannah, with its
fourfold rows of forest trees shading every principal
street, sunstrokes are far less frequent than in the
sun-scorched cities in the North, where there are
comparatively few trees. Furthermore, he claims that
shade is essential to the protection of the eye,- and
that trees are therefore a preventive against ophthal
mia. On that point he says:
"I am still haunted by a recollection of a scene
in the harbor suburb of Girgcnti, where children with
red swollen eyelids were foraging in a dump pile and
wrangling for bones with a number of equally blear
eyed dogs. There was not a tree in sight. Far up
and down the undulating beach the heat of the sun
made the air tremble, and the glare of its reflection
from the refuse of old salt pans was almost as af
flictive as the glitter of a snow field. Yet, on that
same spot, Agrigcntum with its population of keen
eyed Greeks flourished for three hundred years, a
city of gardens and groves, rivaling the wealth of
Carthage, the mistress of the Mediterranean."
Forests, as Dr. Oswald points out, mitigate cli
matic extremes, attract rain and conserve the waters
for a regular flow. at all seasons. When forests have
been totally destroyed over any extensive region the
FORESTS AND MEALTli.
There is a great deal of work to be done this year
by the Republican national committees and bv the
State and county committees of the party. These men
hnvc deserved the liberal support of all Republicans.
They perceive the danger and they have not hesi
tated to declare it. The Republican party must be
thoroughly organized in every State and district, for
it is to be confronted this yrar by an organized oppo
sition of no mean force. Bryan is doing the talking,
but he is not bossing this campaign. Better political
managers than he are preparing Democracy for the
contest on election day, and business men and others
who wish to assure a continuance of prosperity must
do their share in fighting the common foe.
Under such circumstances the prosperous business
men, who are so sanguine of Republican success that
they will not contribute to the campaign fund, are
not displaying much business sense. The election in
November is not going to be determined by public
sentiment, but by the voters who go to the polls. In
every campaign there is always a large number of
persons who stay at home on election day. They arc
r early always members of the party that has been
most sure of winning. by an overwhelming majority.
Consequently the stay-at-home vote this year will be
largely a vote that would have been cast for McKin
ley had it been brought out. It is the duty of the
party to bring it out.
We directed attention yesterday to the circular that
Croker has sent to the officials of the city of New
York who owe their positions to Tammany Hall.
The circular demanded money, and political authori
ties in that city estimate the amount he will receive
from the officials subject to the demand will be not
lcÂ«<; than $500,000. A sum equally large perhaps will
be raised by Tammany from other sources subject to
its domination. The Democratic machine in Chi
cngo will raise another large sum. From the solid
South, where Democrats have to expend nothing to
carry their States, large contributions will be forth
coming. Thus the wcrkers in the Bryan camp will
be well supplied with coin, and, despite the badness of
their cause and the essential weakness of their leader,
they will make a dangerous fight in every doubtful
BRYAN'S appeal at Indianapolis to the Demo
cratic clubs for money as well as for work is
an evidence the Bryanite leaders are not relying
for success in this campaign upon oratory only.
Fot:r years ago there was hardly a single organizer of
first rate importance i:i the Democratic ranks. In the
Democratic National Committee of that year there
was only one man who had ever served on a national
committee before. Bryan in those days had implicit
reliance upon oratory. He expected to win by spell
binding, and cared very little for party organization.
It is different now. Some of the most astute cam
paigners of the nation are backing him. He has the
assistance of Croker and Gorman and others like
them who know the value of organization and who are
aware it cannot be effected without the expenditure
of energy and of money. Consequently Bryan has
been sent to Indianapolis on a money-raising expe
cition. "Come up with the coin" was the burden of
his address to the convention, and it is not unlikely
it will be responded to.
MUCH WORK TO BE DONE.
It is not strange that Roberts should resort to
harsh measures to force the war to a conclusion. It
Ii2s been costly and bloody beyond the expectations
of the world, and every day of its continuance adds
to the lengthening list of losses. A recent compila
tion from official sources in London gives the Brit
ish losses in the different divisions as follows:
For the purpose of forcing the Boers to lay down
their arms Roberts has resorted to extreme measures.
The reports state that the British troops are burning
the homes of all Boers who are still in the field, with
the intention of forcing them to surrender in order to
relieve the distress of their families. It is added there
is deep concern over the widespread famine that may
be thus produced throughout the Transvaal and
Orange River Colony. Hundreds of families have
been made desolate. There are no crops, and starva
tion will soon be an ally of the British in the dread
war against the struggling patriots.
Lord Roberts' dispatches received in London on
Thursday report contests and skirmishes along the
whole front of his far flung battle line. He announced
that Hart has returned to Krugersdorp after having
been in contact with the Boers for twenty-nine days
out of the thirty-three occupied by his expedition:
Buller had returned to Leydcnburg after an advance
which was marked by daily skirmishes; the Dublin
Fusileers had found a detachment of Boers between
Pretoria and Johannesburg and had succeeded in
driving] them from ;heir position only by making a
night assault with the bayonet; and, finally, that a de
tachment of Boers has broken through the British
lines and penetrated into Orange River Colony.
DESPITE the fact that Kruger has abandoned
the country, that all their cities and strong
holds are in the hands of the British, and that
their armies cannot longer hold together in large
masses, the indomitable Boers continue the war.
Some of them, of course, have lost hope and have
surrendered, but a goodly number remain in the field
and defy the efforts of their foes. It is now clear that
when they enlisted for the war they meant the enlist
ment to be binding until death took them or liberty
was attained.
THE INDOMITABLE BOERS.
"Spain in the glory of her ancient woodlands was
the Eden of Southern Europe; treeless Spain has be
come a gehenna of poverty and disease. Forest
shaded Sicily begat athletes and philosophers, heroes
and merchant princes; Sicily in its present sun-blis
tered condition evolves chiefly bandits, beggars and
vermin. The entire coast region of the Mediterra
nean has been 'cleared,' with the result of losing four
fifth of its former population and at least nine-tenths
of its former productiveness. The same in Southern
France, in Portugal, Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, Ar
menia, Persia and Hindustan. It might, indeed, be
questioned if all human follies and crimes taken to
gether have caused as much permanent mischief as
the insane destruction of nature's safeguards against
life-blighting droughts. A land without trees is in
as sad a plight as a flayed animal. The New World's
wealth of woodlands is the chief guarantee of its
To the intelligent reader there is perhaps noth
ing new in all that, and yet all will recognize the
importance of repeating the old lessons over and over
again in California, until the people have been roused
to the importance of profiting by them and putting
them to some practial use. Wasteful methods of cut
ting timber, carelessness in many ways and wide
sweeping fires are rapidly destroying our woods. Un

EDITOR San Francisco Call: I am
a life-long Democrat, but I shall
not vote for Bryan for President.
The silver craze, with which
Bryan is identified, is the principal rea
son. The 16 to 1 idea is not only ab
surd, but also would, if put into practice,
upset all values. Everybody would be
injured, the mechanic and laborer as
well as the merchant. America is to-day
a creditor country and will contniue to
be so unless we change our, monetary
system. Let the ratio of 16" to 1 be
adopted and it will drive out what gold
there is here. Our securities will be
sent back from abroad to be sold here
in immense sums. One crisis would fol
low another. Manufacturing interests
would be greatly injured; labor, which
is now in good demand, would suffer.
No good can come to any one from 16
to 1 excepting the owners of silver
mines, who would receive $1 25 for 60
cents' worth of silver. â¢
Another objection to Bryan is that he
is not a Democrat. I consider him a
Populist. The Populists would control
the offices if he should be elected. The
recent State nominations in Nebraska
illustrate that point clearly. Every
nomination for any office of importance
in Nebraska went to a Populist, and the
Democrats took what little there was
left. .-:
I am a moderate expansionist. With
out expansion I believe that this country
would stand still, just as any other
large corporation which does not ex-
pand and keep up with the times. I be
lieve in holding on to every foot of
land that the American flaj? flies over
and would not give up one bit of ; t.
California has been much benefited by
this expansion. Our trade has grown
and is growing continually by reason of
the policy of the present national admin
istration. I believe that it will keep on
expanding. It would all be lost if
Bryan should be elected.

An Altgeld-Croker administration would be a sight
for gods and men, but Bryan would find it impos
sible to have any other. He would be limited in his
selections to the motley support that placed him in
power, and the country would know just what to ex
pect, and it would not be disappointed.
Such is the record of the man who put Bryan for
ward first four years ago and who probably influences
him more than any other.
Total $982,078 34
This was only the plunder of the State institutions.
In addition to it a large sum was stolen from the
State Treasury under circumstances that have made
Altgeld unable to deny the charge that he had some
thing more than knowledge of it.
His own administration of thr; governorship of Il
linois was the most corrupt ever known. It illus
trated the desperate spirit of the man. It was a car
nival of embezzlement and breach of public trust from
the beginning. The record shows that during his
term the following amounts were stolen from the pub
lic funds of Illinois by his appointees, associates and
tools:
University, of Illinois." 5549.662 29
West Park Board 318.00)00
Chester Penitentiary 30.000 00
Industrial Home frr the Wind 5,000 00
Geneva Home for Girls '. 8.50130
Grain Inspection Department 10.7S5 00
Peoria Insane Asylum C0.63C 75
Altgeld's final ambition is to sit in the Supreme
Court of the United States, and the headship of the
Department of Justice would be the door thereto. He
is not a man who wastes energies, words or hatred.-.
If he desired to kill an enemy he would not wasti
ammunition shooting r.t non-vital spots, but would
aim straight at the heart. He has for years sought
to kill our existing form of government. He wastes
no words on its legislative branch nor on the execu
tive. The vital point of the system is the Supreme
Court, and that he des-ires to reach. He framed the
attack on the courts in the Chicago platform. He
knows where a blow will tell. He knows that our in
stitutions, which he hr.tes, cannot survive destruction
of the judiciary as the rationalizing branch of the
Government.
It is conceded that Altgeld would be Attorney-
General in Bryan's Cabinet. He has been a nisi prius
Judge in Illinois, and really is the strongest an!
brainiest man in the Bryan ranks. He is also the
worst man. an enemv of everything that is; a viper
poisoned against every good institution so far de
veloped by the wisdom and patience of man. He
would be a socialist if he were at heart less of an an
archist. Socialism, with its peaceful methods, is too
slow for Altgeld. He resembles "Bloodybridles"
Waite of Colorado, that poor old pervert, who was
sent to plague that State, in lieu of the frogs, lice
and other lesser evils which scourged the Egyptians.
Nothing could bring into higher light the hypoc
risy of Bryan's pretense than the mention of Morgan
for Secretary of State. He. like Hearst, did all pos
sible kind of blathering in 1898 and the next year to
induce an uninstructed public opinion for holding
the Philippines, and now, turning on their tracks,
both are supporting Dry an and pretending to be
alarmed lest imperialism destroy the liberties of the
people.
When Bryan orders him to haul it down the world
will witness a struggle which has not been seen sine;
Jacob wrestled with the angel.
If such evil as Bryan's election should befall it will
be an interesting sight when Morgan hauls down the
flag which he declared planted there by such distin
guished authority. Hearst merely wanted it nailed to
the Philippines, but Morgan had it divinely planted
there.
But. like his section, he is for expansion. He wants
the Philippines and Cuba, too, and would not object
to a slice of China. He has ceaselessly howled,
bawled, yelled and hiccoughed expansion for years.'
When he was in San Francisco in August, 1898, he
said: "Our flag is in the Philippines and will never
be hauled down. The hand of God planted it there."
lie has the free range of three parties from which
to choose. The new Democracy, the Populists and
the silver Republicans will be entitled to preference
in selecting his official family and confidential ad
visers. Just before his nomination more Cabinet am
bitions were apparent among his supporters than now,
when his hope of election lessens with the progress of
the campaign. At that time it was understood that
Senator Morgan of Alabama would be Secretary ot
State. Having been chairman of the Foreign Affairs
Committee of the Senate, of course he is in line. He
has been a lifelong office-holder under the Southern
Confederacy and the Union, has some of the knowl
edge of public and international law required, and so
seems to possess the icquisite qualifications.
SPECULATION has been indulged in concern
ing the material from which Bryan would select
his Cabinet if the calamity of his election
should be visited upon the country.

latest survivor, the member of the elasa
of '29. which he celebrated on Its anni
versaries with a brilliancy, versification
and wit such as no ether college class that
"keeps a poet" ever had In Its emplov?
Holmes was suf generis-, with great gifts
trimly cut. a kind of scientific precision
in the realm of fancy, and a humorous
way of T.'siÂ»ipg to be dragged out by tha
â¢occasion before he pave the rein to his
muse. He was doctor and professor first,
poet afterward and always. He wrote
"Old Ironsides" and the "Ballad of the
Boston Tea Party" In spirited vein; he
drew the charming portrait of "Dorothy
Q."; he has a few serious poems like
"The Last Leaf." "The Chambered Nau
tilus," "Under the Violet." In which a
very true feeling is expressed with gTeat
delicacy and self-restraint. And he
punned and jested In capital verses, giv
ing of the abundance of his mind, taking
the public into his confidence without un
bending for a moment in the reticence
(Concluded.)
The creator of Zfnobla did not worship
at the shrine of Margaret. He probably
valued silence more than speech. Haw
thorne had, be it remarked, the strongest
horror of being bored, but his manners
were so perfect that this peculiarity al
ways passed for shyness. Read his de
scription of Concord In "Mosses From an
Old Manse." of the "variety of queer,
strangely dressed, oddly behaved people,
most of whom took upon themselves to
be important agents of the world's des
tiny, yet were Fimply bores of a very in
tense water." Earnestness and absurdity
ptrove for. the prize as they have done,
be it whispered, ever since in New Eng
land. The subdivisions of philosophy were
legion; each sought to express itself In
life. The community of Brook Farm was
founded that men might hoe beans to
gether in the beauty of the Idea, but the
idea even about hoeing beans was not a
unit; everybody had his own. When the
abolition struggle came, grotesqueness
and earnestness united under the flag for
a great cause and sincerity gained the
day.
Whittler was the poet of anti-slavery.
His muse had a limited range of ex
pression, but a pure and true note. He
had the religious fervor of an old projjhet,
and the cause of the oppressed was the
bone of his religion. He wrote stirring
war lyrics, Quaker though he was, and
touching appeals to humanity. He was
also the poet of all that is sane and
stanch and good in New England country
life. "Snow Bound" Is our "Cotter's Sat
urday Night." One can see In his poems
how near to the household heart and con
science the slavery question came. It Is
this intimate association of public and
private. right that makes the strength of
a nation: In moments of prosperity we
art too apt to let the tie relax.
But the book of the anti-slavery ques
tion was not a poem. The words that car
ried conviction round the globe were not
winged with meter; they were not even
chosen with any special literary care. It
was the story of Uncle Tom that fired all
hearts. "Uncle Tom's Cabin" was literal
truth, with a touch of melodrama. It

The investigation into the collision be
tween the Columbia and the ferry boat
Berkeley was resumed yesterday after
noon by Vnited States Local Inspectors
of Steam Vessels, Captains Bolles and
Bulger.
Captain Doran of the Columbia was
cross-examined at length by Captain
Bollesi. He testified that the Eerkeley
was turning upstream when the bow ot
the Berkeley wa.Â« abreast of that of the
Columbia. 150 feet away. Two frames
were broken on the starboard side of the
Columbia by the collision and only one on,
the port side. He did not consider that
there was any danger at the time he an
swered the Berkeley's whistle.
Captain Charles C. Tltchwort of the tus
Redmond said that the vessels came to
gether nearly at a right anele.
Captain Blaker of the Berkeley said he
saw the Columbia at the time he blew
his first whistle. At that time the ferry
boat had been gone only a few seconds
from the apron. The ferry slip I3 more
than 400 feet long.
The investigation will be concluded this
morning and Captains Bolles and Bulger
will render a decision early next week.
MORE LIGHT ON THE
3LATE BAY COLLISION
Captains Doran and Blaker Cross-
Examined by United States In-
madethe scenes of plantation life a vivid
reality to readers of all languages, and
though Its literary importance Inevitably
waned with the turning of the wheel of
events. It has kept the boards and Its
hold on the affections. Mrs. Stowe was
also the leader in a humbler and more lit
erary cause. Her short stories of New-
England village life were the first afield
and started the minds of observant writ
ers in that direction.
A legacy .beyond prose or poetry that
the war times left us is the memory of
Abraham Lincoln. His speeches are prm
of the treasures of our literature. His
very witticisms ought to be, for, man of
action though he was, he had the in
sight, tho roetic flash, the perception of
the abÂ«urd and the profound in their vi
tal lelations which belong to creative
genius. He. stood for American thought
In the stress and struggle of events as
Knierson stood for it in its abstract and
philosophical expression, and he had pre
eminently the quality which Emerson
niost lacked â a sympathetic comprehen
sion of actual erring, suffering humanity.
The country was making historians as
fast as it made history. Prescott, Ban
croft, Motley and Parkman all belong to
this epoch and add to its luster, but their
works have to give place in a brief sum
mary like the present to those of the
poets and men of letters who are more in
the line of tne belles-lettres.
Were the Cambridge poets less patriotic
or less American than Emerson or Whit
tier? Did they go abroad for their sub-
Jecfs or follow English models? Were
they less bound up with their country's
aims and struggles? Not at all; but they
represented the element of culture, and it
is the mission and special good of cul
ture to be cosmopolitan, to promote
understanding and the commerce of
literature. Longfellow and Lowell as suc
cessive occupants of the chair of belles
lettres at Harvard for a long array of
years brought all that is best in foreign
aÂ» well as English literature before the
minds of American youth. They were In
close touch with art and life abroad, and
carried over cargoes of American litera
ture In exchange.
Longfellow was the most amply endow
ed of all our poets, the one who sang "to
one clear ham In divers tones." His
verse is always melodious, and the range
of his meters is extraordinarily varied
from the seldom-used hexameter to
"Evangeline" and tbe swinging rhythm
of "Hiawatha," both so well adapted to
their new-world subjects, to the ballad,
the sonnet, the lyric, even blank verse,
though he seems to have cared less for
that form. He failed in none of these;
he was master of each. His sonnets are
very fine. His choice of subjects was also
catholic; they are culled from mythology,
art. ethlc3, from tbe patriotic questions
of his day, and from the traditional and
actual life of his country. To read him
is like listening to a voice of fine reson
ance and compass which â¢ Is sweetest In
Its lowest tones. It is in a certain num
ber of lyrics which bring us into what
George William Curtis has called "the
twilight of the mind, In which the little
facts of life are saddened in view of their
relation to the eternal laws of time and
change." that Longfellow is in his best
and most lovable mood. They have the
tenderness and grace, the combination of
perfect simplicity and popularity with
artl3tic expression which mark the lyric
at its best; indeed, they are a successful
transplantation of that flower of song to
our soil.
Ix>well has something, too, of this grace
and charm, but not In the same perfec
tion. His lyrics are less beautiful than
some of his "longer poems, especially "The
Cathedral" and the "Commemoration
Ode." His range is less wide than that
of his predecessor In the chair of belles
lettres at Harvard, but It Includes humor,
a trait which is missing In Longfellow.
Humor, shrewdness and good sense went
hand In hand with vigorous versification
In .the composition of the "Biglow Pa
pers." He was a. prose writer besides be
ing a poet, his essays standing like those
of Matthew Arnold, In rank and file with
his verse. He was a wit as well, and rec
onciled the World to his country by after
dinner speeches when he represented us
at the court of St. James. Since his death
he has been shown to us as one of the
most delightful of letter .writers, and; we
have another pleasure In store in the com
plete biography which will ere long be
given to the world. t
Lowell comes so near/In many ways to
Longfellow that he has slipped In, against
the laws of precedence, between the older
poet and Oliver Wendell Holmes, the con
temporary of Longfellow. But what fig
ure can more v fittingly close a paper on
the golden age of American literature
thaji that of the poet who, starting almost
and dignity of hts mental attitude, mat
ing It laugh as It had perhaps neve
laughed at anything so fastidiously del
cate In tone.
In his essays he accomplished the reti
cence of putting away his wit in favor of
a sort of modern Addisonian humor of a
delightful flavor. The autocrat was a
little more approachable than the poet. Tt>
the last of his honored life he was un
flagging In the literary charm, and the
thought how few years have passed since
he entertained us "Over the Teacups" la
a reminder that our golden- age was only
the day before yesterday.

A big fleet of deep-water ships made
port yesterday. Some of them came laden
with salmon from the Alaskan canneries;
others carried susar from the Hawaiian
plantations; one brought coal from New
castle; another was a United States trans
port, and still another came from Nome
with about thirty-five gold hunters, who
were more than anxious to get home.
The transport Conemaugh, thirty-five
days from Manila and twenty-five days
from Nagasaki, came in early during the
morning. She brought no passengers and
had a very rough" trip on the great circle.
The big freight boat will be at once fitted
out again and will take another load of
horses and provisions to the Philippines.
The Pacific Steam Whaling Company's
bark John and Winthrop was the next to
get In. She made the run from Nome in
thirty-four days under sail, a very cred
itable performance, considering that
steamers frequently take from twenty-one
to twenty-four days to cover the dis-
Foll'owlng the John and Winthrop came
the bark C. D. Bryant from Honolulu,
with sugar: the ship Two Brothers from
Pyramid Harbor, with 47.610 cases of
palmon, and the ship St. Nicholas from
Xashagak, with 62,224 cases of salmon,
both consigned to the Alaska Packers'
Association; the French bark Charles
(iounoj from Newcastle. K. S. \V.. with
3300 tons of coal;. the bark St. Katherlne
from Honolulu, with sugar; the steamer
Umatllla from Victoria, B. C, and the
tu*r Equator from Kodiak.
The French bark Charles Gounod *is a
brand-new vessel on her maiden trip, and
is one of the last of the lleet built last
year under the new French subsidy law.
She is a handsome craft and is already
under charter to load wheat here for Ku
rope.
CANNERY FLEET MOVEMENTS.
Narrow Escape of the Tug Equator
From Two Waterspouts.
The tug Equator reports that the J. D.
Peters was t.o sail about September 23
from Kodlak. The schooner Maid of
Orleans was expected to sail the same
day. The ship Indiana was to get away
from Karluk about September 23. while
the bark Harvester was to leave Oyak
Bav September 24. The Santa Clara was
lying in Oyak Bay, awaiting a chance to
load at Karluk when the Equator left.
The Equator had a narrow escape com
ing down the coast. "When in latitude 46
degrees north, longitude 129 degrees 12
minutes west, two huge waterspouts
were seen bearing down on the vessel.
After watching them for a few moments
and noting their course the captain at
once put his vessel about and headed in
shore at full speed. The danger soon
passed and thon the Equator held on her
course. This makes the fourth vessel that
has reported waterspouts on! the coast
during the past few months.
The San Francisco ship "Wachusett is
now practically given up as lost. She Is
143 days out from Newcastle, N: S. \V\,
for Kahului, with a cargo of coal, and 90
per cent is being paid to reinsure her
chances. '
The Alex McNeil, also owned In San
Francisco and now out 155 days from Pu
get Sound for Fremantle, Australia, Is
being- reinsured at 40 per cent, while the
British ship Lancing, which is managed
here, has 20 per cent offered on her
chances. The Lancing Is now out 117 days
from Puget Sound for Port Pirie, Austra
lia. Th"> British bark Limacne is now out
eighty days from Callao for Tocaplllo and
the underwriters are paying 70 per cent on
her chances. Relnsurance - gamblers seem
to think that three out of four of these
vessels will reach port.
The Federal Grand Jury yesterday re
turned a true bill of Indictment against
Lewis Peters charging him with assault
with a dangerouo weapon on the high
seas. Peters wau boatswain of the
steamer San Juan. On September 7 of
this year Peters had an altercation with
William Shanahan, the mate, in the
course of which Peters stabbed Shanahan
In thÂ» left shoulder-blade with a sheath
knife, inflicting a trifling wound. United
States District Judge Hawley fixed the
amount of Peters' ball at $1000.
Water Front Notes.
The Stockton rivor steamer I>auntless
had a hard time of It getting hack to San
Francisco yesterday. For a long time
the crew has been grumbllriK at the food
plven them, and .Thursday night, accord
; ing to them, it was worse than usual.
TVnen Stockton was reached all the long
shoremen quit In a body and the steamer
was tied up for a time. Finally a new
crew was secured, but those men are ex
pected to quit as soon as they get back
to Stockton, so all the trouble will have
to be pone over again.
The new tug Slocumb, for the use of the
i army transport service, Is expected here
In a few days. She left Acapulco on Sep
tember 28 and should reach here Sun
day. The L.ewls E. Luckenbach is not
far behind her and should reach port the
latter part of next week.
The largest dredging machine ever built
on the Pacific Coast Is now under con
struction at Hay & Wright's yards in
Oakland Creek. She will be 150 feet ions.
50 feet beam and 12 feet deep. Powerful
machinery will be put on her and when
completed she will be a monster. Once
In good working . order the monster
dredger will go to work on the levees
between Eacramento and Yolo.
' A Taxe of the ferry steamer Newark
met with a peculiar accident yesterday.
"While the Newp.rk was docking, by some
mishap the flagpole was knocked down
and fell across Tajce'a.hand. His second
finger was so badly smashed that he had
to have It amputated at the Harbor Hos
pital.

STJDDEN RISE IN
THE PRICE OF PORK
Sir Thomas Lipton, the English Tea
Merchant, is Said to Be Be
hind the Deal.
CHICAGO. Oct. 5.â "Shorts" on October
pork were given an unexpected shaking
up to-day by the price jumping $2 per
barrel, part of it at the rate of 50 cents be
tween trades. The price went up from $13
to $15 and closed at $14 50, a net gain of
Jl 40 for the day. Within thirty days
there has been an advance of $3 20. air
Thomas J. Lipton. the English tea mer
chant, is behind .the deal. The advance
was without any great excitement, as no t
to exceed 6000 barrels changeu hands. It
was a scramble on the part of the shorts,
with light offerings.
- A week ago there was an estimated
shortage of 75,000 barrels, or more than
double the actual stock here. Lipton Is
stripping it and selling the strips in large
quantities at 6% cents a pound, one lot of
300,000 pounds being disposed of to-day at
that figure, v
"We have no pork to sell for specula
tive purposes," said his representatives,
"but if anybody wants It to ship it out we
can accommodate them at reasonable fig
ures."

caught In the great storm, were blown

with the unfortunate miners aboard.

fully nursed after their rescue by the offi

not one drop of fresh water had been
taken aboard. A strong wind was blow
ing off the shore when they started and

Flanagan of Philadelphia, ex-champion
bantam-weight of America, fell uncon
scious in the sixth and last round of a
contest with Jimmy Devine, a local
boxer, and at a late hour to-night. lies In
a critical condition in a hospital. Flana
gan's manager. Bob Delaney, Jimmy De
vlne and the seconds of both fighters were
placed under arrest pending an examina
tion of Flanagan's condition.
According to those at the ringside,
Flanagan's collapse was unaccountable.
It peemed to most of them as though no
blow had been struck. Those sitting fur
ther back, however, thinking there had
been a knockout, set up a cheer. Flana
gan's manager and seconds Jumped into
the ring, where Devlne was standing over
the prostrate boxer with a look of aston
ishment on his face. Flanagan was car
ried to his corner. All efforts to revive
him failed and he was taken to a hospital
near by, where the physicians expressed
doubt as to his recovery.
At the hospital the case was diagnosed
as hemorrhage of the brain. The doctors
could not say whether this was due to a
blow or some other cause.
Some months ago when Flanagan was
knocked out by Danny Dougherty, ten
hours elapsed before the physicians suc
ceeded in bringing him to.
The opinion Is expressed that Flanagan
may have been seized to-night with an
attack of vertigo.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PALO ALTO. Oct. 5.â An enthusiastic
rally was held to-night by the Stanford
University and Palo Alto Republican
Clubs. Nortree Hall was crowded. Pro
fessor Sanford presided and Introduced
A. J. Dannebaum of the University of
California. â¢
Mr. Dannebaum said that Imperialism
was used by the Democrats to veil the
real issuesâ the tariff and the silver ques
tion. If Jefferson, who was an ardent ex
pansionist, were alive to-day he would
be a Republican. The facilities of modern
times, he said, had rendered as nothing
the remoteness of the Philippines as com
pared with that of Louisiana one hundred
years ago. The Republican party had
done its duty bv the people and the peo
ple should do tnelr duty by the Republi
can party.
Hon. IX E. McKlnlay of Santa Rosa
made a rousing speech and was frequent
ly interrupted by applause. He said that
the people were never so united as they
were now. Washington, Jefferson, Jack
son. Lincoln and Grant were all called
imperialists and McKinley was called an
imperialist for upholding the same poli
cies. Imperialism, said he, was a catch
word used by the Democrats to draw the
votes of the uninformed. In order to
have prosperity, labor and capital must
work together, which was impossible
under the Democratic platform. Mr. Mc-
Klnlay made his arguments clear by apt
illustrations and stories which kept the
audience in an uproar.
The meeting. was largely attended by
university students. Music was well
rendered by the university band.

SAX JOSE, Oct. 5â Mystery was added
to-day to the trial of Constable Begerow
of Alviso for the murder "of Joseph Cech
by the disappearance of B. Benjamin, one
of the jurors. When court opened Ben
jamin was not in his place, and all sounds
of the bailiffs voice failed to bring him
Into court. An adjournment till 11 o'clock
was taken, and later till 2. At the after
noon hour the juror was still missing,
and the cape was continued until Mon
day morning at 10 o'clock. Judge Lorigan
issued a bench warrant for Benjamin, and
instructed the Sheriff to find the recre
ant juror and bring him Into court on
Monaay.
None of Benjamin's friends or rela
tives can account for his erratic conduct,
although it is said by relatives that a
j=hort time ago he mysteriously disap
peared from his home for a couple of
days.
Benjamin has acted as a purchasing
agent, making daily trips to San Fran
cisco. He strenuously objected to serving
as a juror, but the court overruled his
objection. Benjamin was seen to board
the 5:35 train for Ban Francisco las:
Might. His wife has been visiting In the
metropolis for* the past week, but over
the telephone to-day t=he declared her
husband was not with her.
I'nleps IJenjamin returns Monday morn-
Ing, the trial probably will have to be
commenced over apain. The bulk of the
testimony Riven by the witnesses has
eustalned Kegerow's pl^a of self defense,
and the peneral impr^sFion is that he will
be acquitted. Now Benjamin's disappear
ance has arjiied now complications.

ATTORNEY FAILS TO
MAKE HIS CHARGES GOOD
Grand Jury Investigates Alleged
Scandal in Health Department,
but Is Not Enlightened.
The Grand Jury made an effort yester-
day to probe the charges made by Attor
ney Joseph Rothschild against the
administration of the present food
inspection bureau. Rothschild had
made persistent accusations against
food inspectors, claiming they had
been derelict in their duty be
cause they had been paid not to condemn
impure milk, also that there had been no
milk condemned for some time past.
RothschiM also made vague charges that
bribes had been accepted by inspectors
during the Chinatown quarantine.
The Board of Health reauested the
Grand Jury to investigate the matter, but
the latter body failed to be enlightened
when Rothschild was a witness before it
yesterday. To all <juest!on3 he replied
that he "did not know and he failed to
make his charges good. He was before
the Grand Jury for five minutes only and
proved so unsatisfactory a witness that
he was allowed to take his departure.

Citizens who have registered and who
have changed their residence since Janu

October 11, to re-register. As many

JUSTICES OP THE PEACE
,\ GO ON GENERAL TICKET
Registrar So Decides, Though Gov
ernor Did Not Include Them in
His Election Proclamation.
Notwithstanding the fact that Governor
Gape omitted to call for the election for
five Justices of the Peace in his election
proclamation. Registrar Walsh says that
all the candidates for the office will be
placed on the general ticket to be voted for
on November 6, 1900. This course is In
accordance with the opinion handed down
by the City Attorney last April in which
he advised the Registrar to make all
preparations for the election of Justices
of the Peace, which the charter provides
shall be elected at the same time as mem
bers of the Legislature. The Registrar
says the proclamation of the Governor
does not cut much figure. Heretofore the
Judges of the Superior Court were includ
ed in the call for the election, but this
is the first time that the candidates will
go on the State ticket, the idea being to
avoid the use of two ballots, which will
save expense and facilitate the handling
of returns.
In an opinion of the Attorney General
on the subject he holds that the Justices
of the Peace are not municipal, hut State
judicial officers. He further states that "it

PLOT TO MURDER "BIG" CHUNG;
WAYNE HARRIS IS ACQUITTED
The Notorious Chinese
Gambler Said to Be
a Marked Man.
Sergeant McManus Has a
Lively Chase After Sup
posed Assassin.
Chinatown i= excited over an alleged
plot to assassinate Chin Chunp, otherwise
known as 'â¢Big" Chung, the most
notorious Chinese gambler on the Pacific
Coast. An attempt to consummate
the plot is supposed to have been made
late Thursday r.lpht. but was frustrated
by tie sudden appearance on the scene of
ppre^snt Barr.t-y McManus. The police
pergeant chased the would-be murderer
for several bloc"ks. but finally lost him in
the Chinese Th'-ater.
Fcr fome tim*.' past it has twen rumored
in Chinatown that an attempt would be
made \o kill "Big" Chunir, who is the rec

many enemies, and these people are said
to have conspired against him. Every
precaution has been takc-n by Big Chung's
friends and associates to protect him from
assassins. Chung himself lias been cau

ings siren him.
Thursday right Sergeant McManus ob-
Krved a Chinese approach Chung from
behind as he was passing through an
alley. The sergeant waited for a few mo
moiiti-- and i:i-ally became convinced that
the man had a gun and was ibout to com

the p-iir dasned down Ltupont and Jatk

the crowd. The sergeant spent some time

The Chinos claim that Chung's enemies

MENT TO DR. EDMOND L. GROS, THE WELL-KNOWN PHYSI
CIAN. HAS JUST BEEN ANNOUNCED IN PARIS.
November 21, ISSO, Melone and William T.
Wallace, as set forth in the complaint,
made an agreement that William T. Wal
lace was to receive for his assistance one
half of the sums recovered in the proceed
ings. Melone has set up that he received
J3fS.15O 25 from P'acervllle, but that his
share of that sum had been more than
counterbalanced by his expenditures to
get the bonds paid. Upon the advice of
William T. Wallace, so Melone averred,
he paid out from 1S?O to January 1. ISSt.
the sum of $11,600, which, with interest I
up to this year, would have amounted to
$1 2.230.
The items in the bill of particulars filed
yesterday amount to S11.S&4. The sensa
tional part of the averment Is that AV. T.
Wallace used his influence !n December
and January, 15S1, to procure from the
Legislature the passage of a bill to facili
tate the collection of Melone's claim.
Judge Wallace was ill last evening and
could not be seen. Ryland Wallace, his
son, who la a party to the suit, said he
had never heard of any such alleged facts
as were mentioned in Mr. Melone's bill of
particulars.
"It is all strange to me," said Mr. Wal
lace. "The dates mentioned are 1SS0-S1.
No bill was passed at that time by the
Legislature to enable Placervllle to in
corporate. Had there been the claim
would have been collected long ago,
without doubt. The Piacerville bill was
passed only last year. I don't understand
u at all."
EX-JUDGE W. T. WALLACE,

CHICAGO, Oct. 5.â November wheat opened
>4c lower to unchanged, at 77U(&77Hc. Liver
pool was weak, however, and Argentine ship
ments 664.000 bushels, compared with 256.00U
bushels the previous week. As the outside was
not buying selling by local longs sent Novem
ber down to 77c. Northwest receipts were
small, rain was predicted for this section of
the country and the cash situation later im
proved, local sales being reported of 300.0M
bushels. Under these considerations the mar
ket began slowly to rally and toward the enu
of the session rallied sharply to 77%@77%c 111
sympathy with the bulge In October pork. The
close was firm, November He higher at 77Hc.
Corn was quiet. November closed unchanged
at 37%c.
Oats were quiet and steady. November closed
%c lower at 22H@22%c.
In provisions everything was overshadowed
by the sensational rise In October pork. Octo
ber pork opened 10c lower at J13. Half a
dozen attempts to fill orders resulted Jn u
bulge to J15, and the close was at $14 60. The
strength of October was influential in holding
the rest of the list steady. January pork closed
15c higher, lard 2Vfee higher and ribs 5c up.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
NEW YORK, Oct. 5.â Bradstreefs to-morrow
will pay: Despite some irregularities both as
to demand and prices, due partly to warm,
rainy weather, but likewise a reflection of a
hesitancy to embark largely In new business
pending political events, the Keneral tone of
trade Is a favorable one and confidence as to
the outlook for business In the remainder of
the year Is notable. Some diminution in the
volume of Jobbing business Is noted at large
Western centers and continued rainy weather
In the Northwest alike checks the movement
of wheat to market. Injures the grade of the
same and discourages retail and Jobbing dis
tribution. Ten-cent cotton Is the key to the
very favorable report which comes from the
South and the character of reports from this
section is more nearly favorable than for
many years past at this time. The indispo
sition to contract heavily aa to the future U
perhaps most marked In the Iron and steel
trade and here also the most marked tendency
toward -weakness In the crude forms of pro
duction is noted. The Industrial outlook has
been Improved by the Blgnlng of the tin plate
scale, but the anthracite coal situation Is, on
the surface at least, rather more unfavorable
than a week ago. more mines and miners be
ing Idle and production steadily diminishing.
Special weaknecs Is noted In the sugar trade,
owing to the practical break of the raw sugar
corner as much as to the passing of the can
ning season and the reported intention of the
refiners to reopen the. war on prices. Special
strength Is noted In provisions and . hop pro
ducts In which the very strong statistical polnc
Is receiving more attention. The strength of
the railroad situation Is reflected in earnings
fully equal to last year and in instances
larger and the announcement that rates are
to be advanced on November 1. October dis
bursements were the heaviest ever known and
are partly reflected in current bank clearlng3,
which are the largest since last June. The
rail situation Is the cynosure of eyes In the
Iron and steel trade. A Western road has
bought 25,000 tons at Chicago and a large
anthracite railroad has gone Into the market
at the East, but the heaviest systems have not
yet contracted for their requirements though
announcements are awaited with Interest be
cause of the example they set to buyers gen
erally. Pig Iron is weak- all around, being
lower at the South and at Plttsburg and the
demand is largely for small lots. Export de
mand Is being favored by lower freights. A
help to the market for plates has been afforded
by the order for 6000 steel cars given by a
trunk line.
Wheat, Including flour, shipments for thÂ»
week aggregate 4,459.167 bushels, against 4.242,
810 bushels last week. 5.183.3SS bushels In the
corresponding week of 1899. and b,'497,224 busheU
In 1S&S.
From July 1 to date this season wheat ex
ports are 47.221.C67 bushels, against &5,699,413
bushels last season.
Business failures In the United States for
the week numbered 177, as against 169 last
week. 146 In this week a year ago and 163 m

Canadian failures for the week number 18,

I The money market was decidedly firmer, loans
: being: curtailed, owing to the heavy withdrawals
' of funds to the South and West, though the
, bank statement of last Saturday was more fa
; vorable than had been anticipated, so far as
i the reduction of surplus reserve Is concerned.
; Time mon<?y, however, advanced to 5 per cent
; and call money was firmer at 2^Â©3 per cent,
i The firmness of money was offset to some ex
i tent by the further decline of exchange which,
, as explained elsewhere, caused some expecta
| tlon of pold exports. It Is hardly thought, how
, ever, that any large amount of specie would be
' sent here at present, owing, to the continued
I strain In the position at the financial capitals
t abroad. London.took only a moderate interest
in our stock market, but was a buyer to some
little extent, particularly In the Pacific stocks.
It was also noted that Berlin Interests were
! apain buyers of Northern Pacific common, after
j having sold that stock heavily In the preceding
fortnight.
Speculative sentiment appeared to undergo a
change this week. The bearish feeling and de
clining tendency in prices, which had been
generally displayed for the preceding fortnight,
gave place to an exhibit of renewed confidence
and rising values. The Immediate cause of this
movement was the announcement that the an
thracite coal strike would be ended and, though
the concession of an Increase of wages to the
miners by the companies did not result in the
prompt collapse of the strike or the reopening
of the mines, the street seemed to accept the
idea that under the circumstances the strike
would not last. Reports that a settlement had
been arrived at were brought out several times
during the week and always produced consid
erable effect in strengthening the market. An
other factor In the same connection was the
prevalence among financial interests of de
creased apprehension about the outcome of the
pending election. Exactly what this is based
on is hard to determine, but it would seem that
the reappearance of support in various parts
of the market. r>o:~.iing irom powerful financial
interests, may be attributed to this influence.
The public, however, cannot be said to show
a disposition to follow such bullish leadership
or to indulge in any speculative buying-. The
large increase In the current transactions at
the Stock Exchange was, on the whole, due to
professional activity and the covering of the
large amount of short contracts that have been
put out in anticipation of a break was largely
responsible for the sharp advances In many
stoc!:s.

vertiser's London financial cablegram says: The
markets here were buoyant to-daj' on the Gov
ernment victories on the election, the profes
sionals laying in stocks en the expectation of
a boom and the bears abo covering. The elec
tions are retarded as the last obstacle to act

ducing about double the exchange they did a
year ago, and as the crop is being moved with
the funds shipped from New York and without
gold Imports from Europe the net result la that
New York is loaning foreigners about half. the
value of the crop. Most manufacturing con
cerns are delaying extensive production until
after election and are buying little raw ma

end was also depressed by the cut In Southern
freight rates. Finished material and struc
tural lines are steady and export buying does
much to prevent dullness. Contracts for oars,
bridges and plates for phipbuildlng were sls?neil
during the week and rails were fold at $2b to
domestic roads, while a small amount was
taken by Italy. Boot and shoe factories are
more actively employed on ruÂ«h orders, con

sprinK contracts are postponed. Kales of wool

tember there was a decline in the price of
corn tor the current month's delivery, but ele
vctor prices remained firm and recelptb for
the week were only 4.S40.S02 bushels, against
7,679,540 last year, while Atlantic exports were
2,144,610 bushels, against 2,992.232 a year ago.

the same time and was. badly bruised
about the back. After treatment at the
receiving hospital he was taken to the

wagon, was booked at the city prison for

He was unaware that they had renewed
their efforts to steal a ride until after the
accident.
Joseph Pedro, the father of the dead
boy, is employed as a coal shoveler at the
Market-street bunkers. The child was the
eldest in a family of five.

"After making a request for the books,"
said Mr. Van Bokkelen. "Mr. Watkinson
spoke up and said: 'Gentlemen, I might
just as well be candid with you from the
Ptart and say that we have no records
prior to the consolidation of the Contra
Costa and Oakland Water Companies.
When we removed from our old office i
to our present quarters we decided that
as we had no room at the new office for
our old records we might as well destroy
them. We then had five wagon loads of
the old books brought up from the base-
The witness testified that he went to
see President Watkinson on July 13 In
company with the other expert account
ant, J. R. Crandall, and Deputy City At
torney Condon.
The details of the burning of the books
containing the records of the water com
pany prior to consolidation were brought
out by Van BoUkelen. who recounted his
interview with President J. H. T. Watkin
son on July 13. When the case was re
sumed this morning Van Bokkelen was
recalled to the stand by Mr. Hayne. who
requested the witness to state what was
said by the officials of .the water com
pany when the demand was made toe
their books of account. t
All of the testimony introduced by the
city's attorney to-day was presented In
support of the claim that the officials of
the Contra Costa Water Company acted
in contempt of court when they ordered
the destruction of the records of the com
pany prior to its consolidation with the
Oakland Water Company. An effort was
made to prove that Judge Hart's order
granting the city's regularly appointed
experts permission to examine the water
company's books of account was ignored
and that by so doing .he corporation offi
cials were guilty of a violation of the
law. In support of their contention At
torneys Hayne and Dow. for the city,
placed Experts Van Bokkelen and Cran
dall on the stand to testify as to what
took place when the demand was made
on the company for its accounts.
The officials of the Contra Costa Water
Company were charged with contempt of
court by the city's counsel to-day. Their
failure to produce their books of account
when ordered to do so by Judge Hart
was arraigned against them and an effort
was made to show the violation of the
court's mandate.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway. Oct. 5.
"I think I will bo able to show," he
said, "that those records were destroyed
to prevent a full and fair Investigation
of the accounts of this corporation."
Mr. Hayne objected to the Introduction
of the map book !n evidence as he held
that Its authenticity had not been estab
lished, and he was met with a reply from
Mr. McCutcheon to the effect that he was
trying to prevent the case from being
tried on its merits.
Further argument was stopped by
Judge Hart, who ruled that the book was
proper evidence In the preliminary In
quiry as to whether or not the company
had refused the city permission t o see
its records. The court remarked that the
hook would not be considered as evidence
in the case Itself.
Continuing with his testimony Expert
Van Bokkelen said he later made a de
mand upon the water company for the re
cords showing the cost or the company's
property, but he could gain no Informa
tion. Mr. Watkinson, he said, also re-
Mr. McCutcheon asked the witness if he
could not have obtained ail the needed In
formation from the company's map-bocK.
Van Bokkelen replied that he could not.
The witness proceeded to explain, when
he was stopped by Mr. Hayne, who stated
that the water company would like to pick
out a few particular books and allow the
city's experts to examine them but no
others.
On cross-examination the witness told
of conversations he had had with Secre
tary Walter C. Beattie of the water com
pany during the absence of President
Watkinson. Beattie always referred him
to William J. Dingee or Mr. McCutcheon.
"Mr. Watkinson told me." continued the
witness, "that the papers were burned on
May 24, 1809. He offered to show us any
other records in the office. Mr. Watkin
son then tendered us the company's ledger
and Journal. In these books the first en
tries were dated August 1. 1SD9. We then
made a request for the records of the time
between the burning of the books on May
24 and August 1 and were told that these
accounts had been kept on loose sheets
and later destroyed as being of no value.*
Mr. Van Bokkelen refreshed his mem
ory from a typewritten account of the
Interview with Watkinson and to this na
per Attorney McCutcheon Interposed nu
merous ineffectual objections.
ment and taken to our corporation yards,
where they were burned. I had an em
ploye at the yards watch the fire carefully
to see that none of the half-burned papers
blew away, as I did not want them flying
around town. You may send me to jail
for making the little bonfire, but It was
simply because we lacked room that we
burned the records, which were practi
cally useless, anyway. If I had known
this suit was coming up I would have
had the books and papers preserved, but
as it was I did not think they were of any
value.' "
Argument will be made at that time
on the question whether or not the offi
cials of the Contra Costa "Water Com
pany violated Judge Hart's order to pro
duce their books of account for examina
tion by the experts appointed by the
city's counsel.
Hewson was called upon to identify the
mans Introduced as evidence. He went
over the large map book page by page
and identified each separate drawing.
When Mr. Hewson had concluded h!a
testimony Hayne announced that the
city rested its case so far as the alleged
violation of the order of court was con
cerned. McCutcheon replied that the
water company had no testimony to offer
on that point and wan ready for argu
ment. It being agreeable to all concern
ed, argument was postponed until Tues
day morning at 10 o'clock.
Crandall testified that the testimony of
Mr. Van Bokkelen relative to the inter
view with President Watkinson was cor
rect and in answer to the questioning of
Mr. Hayne he repeated much of the con
versation had at that time. A great deal
of time was consumed In arguing the
relevancy of questions put to Mr. Cran
dall. He was excused to make way for
F. M. Hewson, the Contra Costa Water
Company's constructing engineer and
custodian of Its maps.
J. P. Crandall. Mr. Van Bokkelen's fel
low expert, was the next witness. Mr.
Hayne stated that the witness was called
to corroborate Van Bokkelen's, testimony,
and asked if the company's attorneys
were willing to stipulate that he would
do so. This Mr. McCutcheon and Mr.
Moore refused to do.
"Your remarks were entirely uncalled
for. Mr. McCutchecn." said Judge Hart.
"Proceed with the examination."
"I will not stand any such statementa
from you, Mr. McCutcheon. or any other
attorney. I am? honest when I say I do
not understand the word in the sense
used."
This remark brought the witness to his
feet and. Ignoring the court's admoni
tions, he declared:
"This witness knows exactly what I
mean," said Mr. McCutcheon, rather
testily. "He does not want to place any
construction upon it that will tend trÂ»
Injure the city's case. He is altogether
too careful."
fused him data In regard to rea! estate
owned by the corporation.
"I was not told." testified the expert,
"that the map book in evidence here con
tained descriptions of all the property
owned by the company. Mr. Watkinson
has told me that all the records prior ti>
the consolidation had been destroyed."
The witness was asked a uuestion in
regard to the "descriptions" In the map
book and showed some hesitation about
answering, stating that he did not quite
understand the word "descriptions" in
the sense used.

NEW YORK, Oct. 5.â When Lawyers
Patrick and Jones were arraigned In court
this afternoon Assistant District Attor

which he swore that he believed Patrick
and Jones to be guilty of forgery, acting

are suspected of having forged to checks
by acting in concert.
Patrick and Jones were then arraigned
and Magistrate Mott held them in $10,000

that it would be on complaint of forging
these checks that the Ditsrict Attorney

found in Mr. Rice's strong box in the
vaults of the Safe Deposit Company of

this box was estimated on Thursday
evening by Captain Baker as at least
$l,000.0"0. After a more thorough exami
nation of the Inventory Mr. Gerard said
to-day that they were worth about $2,

placed a valuation of $750,000 on these se
curities although he said he knew ex

BERKELEY, Oct. 6.â The Town Trus
tees decided last night that their claim
against J. L. Barker and A. W. Xayior
for J4J0. alleged to be due on an agree
ment made by the gentlemen to indem
nify the town for losses of revenue from
liquor licenses on the passage of a pro
hibitive ordinance, was not good. After
hearing Mr. Barker's reasons for the non
payment of the money a majority of the
Trustees took his view of the matter and
voted to accept his statement. Thus the
claim was dropped.
On July 1. lss*. Mr. Barker and Mr.
Naylor agreed, on behalf of the temper
ance people, to pay the town $1SOO for one
year in quarterly payments, provided a
prohibitive ordinance was passed. The
saloon men were given three months to
close out their business. In presenting
his arguments Mr. Barker Faid that that
quarter's licenses from the saloon men
took the place of the first quarter's pay
ment by him and Naylor. He further
stated that they had promised in the ex
pectation that the prohibitive ordinance
would be parsed and enforced.
"You know, gentlemen, as well as we
do." eaid Mr. Barker, "that the ordinance
has not been enforced and the saloons
have been selling all the. time, and are to
day openly selling liquor. We rest our
case, asking simply Justice and what is
right."
A motion to drop the claim was voted
en as follows: Ayesâ President W. H.
Marston, Trustees E. Q. Turner, A. R
Frame and R. C. Staats; noesâ Trustees
Thomas Dowd and Christian Hoff: ab
sent. Trustee L. J. I^eConte.
The people at the next election will be
asked to vote for an Increased tax rate to
defray the town's expenses. The present
board favors the prohib ( 'ion ordinance.

Fire at Welbeck Abbey.
LONDON, Oct. 5.â A serious fire has
occurred at Welbeck \ Abbey, Worksop,
Nottinghamshire, the famous seat of the
Duke of Portland. The. Oxford wing was
gutted. The Duke and Duchess of Port
land are at present absent from- home.
The damage was estimated at Â£100,000.

Discouraging Report From Cabell
Whitehead, Acting Agent of
* the Mint Bureau.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 5.â Cabell White
head, assayer of the mint and at present
acting as expert special agent of the mint
bureau at Nome City, Alaska, in a re
port dated September 3 to George E.
Roberts, director of the mint, says that
the Nome beach has been worked out
practically and that some of the sluices
nave not paid expenses. The entire beacb
product for the year Is estimated at from
$250,000 to $300,000. Â»,
Much of the g-old dust In circulation in
Nome, Mr. Whitehead says, comes from
Dawson. Anvil Creek, which has been the
greatest producer up to this time and
which gives promise of yielding good re
turns for some time to come, has pro â¢
duced this year about $750,000. On Dexter
Creek there are a number of rich claims
and Snow Creek which already has pro
duced $300,600 this year. Is regarded as an
exceptionally rich district. Local compli
cations, however, Mr. Whitehead says,
are rapidly involving all of the claims of
value in the Nome region and many of
them are in the hands of receivers, who
are operating them under the direction of
the court. As a consequence investments
In mines are at a standstill.
SAYS THE NOME BEACH IS
PRACTICALITY WORKED OUT
MILWAUKEE. WIs., Oct. 5.â An Even-

"Mr. Bryan Beekg power by an appeal
to the antl-expansioh and anti-trust sen
timent of the people. The difficulties of
our external policy were unforeseen, as
their solution is at present unrevealed.
The evil of trusts has no party parent
age and will be remedied by the com
bined intelligence of our parties. With
out minimizing the perils of either, wo
affirm that no greater evil can befall our
Government than the Impairment of its
vigor, the destruction of our credit and tne
ruin of our Industries, which Mr. Bryan
is specially pledged to effect if he gets
the power. Therefore, we appeal to our
countrymen again to divert disaster from
their country by his defeat'."
INDIANAPOLIS, Oct. 5.â The executive
committee of the gold Democratic party
to-night Issued a long- address to the
members of the party. The address at

Van Wyck ice island is situated in the
newly discovered territory which was
charted by the Belgian Antarctic expe
dition in 1S9S. Officials of this expedition
win, within the next three days, present
Mayor Van Wyck with a large chart
prominently showing 1 the island which has
been named after him and, at the same
time, he will receive a memorial letter an
nouncing In official terms the facts of the
christening, the date of discovery and the
location of the Van Wyck island of Ice.
There is plenty of ice on Van Wyck
Island. It is estimated to be some 500
feet thick, and is about three miles long
by two miles wideâ practically an unlim
ited supply.
"While the Mayor, in February. 1S9S, was
discovering large blocks of Ice trust stock
and having as many as possible named
after him at rock-bottom figures an in
dependent party of explorers was pushing
its way into the unknown regions sur
rounding the soiith pole.
The story of lm> discovery of Van Wyck
Ice island is full of thrilling incidents.
The little ship Belgica had been through
the most terrible storms and the hardy
explorers on board of her had endured
untold sufferings. On February 5, 1S9S,
the ship anchored in a bay of Belgia
Straits. Dr. Frederick A. Cook of Brook
lyn. the anthropologist of the expedition,'
and Roald Amundsen, the first mate of
XEW YORK. Oct. 6.â Mayor Van "Wyck
has just been honored by having an island
of ice christened after him. The ice is of
the best quality and is unlimited in sup
ply. It is quite a distance from Xew York,
being near the south pole.
On the official chart Just issued by the
Belgian Government showing the uOO miles
of new land charted by the Belgian Ant
arctic expedition He Van Wyck. or. In
English. Van Wyck Island. Is quite larsre.
A copy of this map will soon be presented
to the Mayor. Dr. Cook has just pub
lished a book entitled "Through the First
Antarctic Night." which also sets forth
the fact that the Mayor of Greater New
York has had an island named after him.
Its peaks were composed of black stone
covered hy-moss and lichens. Its base
was Incased In thick layers of Ice. This
Ice was shining: In the sun. reflecting all
the myriad hues of the rainbow. The ice
was so beautiful In color that It Ira
pressed Dr. Cook forciblv. When he re
turned to the ship he suggested that the
island be called Van Wyck Island.
Dr. Cook, when aslceo. by a World re
porter concerning- the naming- of the
island after the Mayor, said:
"Each officer of the expedition had the
privilege of giving seme names to cer
tain points In the new country of Danco
Land. I did not know Mayor Van Wyck.
but It seemed to me that as he> was the
first Mayor of Greater New York his
name would look well on the maps. As
his was also a Dutch name and the ship
had been fitted out at Antwerp the name
proved suitable to the rest of the party.
"Van Wyck Island is really beautifully
situated. Its peaks are irregular in for
mation and its ice-Incased base makes it
a picturesque object to look at. In size
it Is about as large as Blackwells Island."
the Belglca, went ashore and ascended to
the highlands of Monts Salvey, overlook-
Ing portions of Danco Landâ a new conti
nent discovered by the Belgian narty. Far
to the eastward Dr. Cook descried a beau
tiful Island.

Mind When They Christened It.

Latour's Will Sustained.
A Jury in Judge Troutt's court has sus
tained the will of the fate" Felix Latour,
who died recently at Twin Valleys Lake
County, leaving an estate valued at $20 000
Latour bequeathed his entire estate' to
Caroline Ford. His widow, from whom
ne.;had been separated for many years
came to this city after her Husbands will'
had been filed for probate and charced
Caroline Ford with having unduly in
fluenced the deceased. The Jury how
ever, found that such was not the case
and rendered a verdict for the proponent
An Itinerant Audience.
For the second time this week the two
opera companies in town announced' the
same bill for the same evening â "Faust."
In this instance It was to be given last
night. Â¦â¢
Of course, the Tivoll Opera-house came
up to timeâ it always does, somehow,
even if it has to put on Tom Greene to
sing Tannhauser once in a whileâ but with
the fiendish luck that has of late pursued
the California Theater, some of the prin
cipals at the last moment developed a
severe fit of artistic indisposition, "they
wouldn't!"â "no, they couldn't!"â and
they didn't immortalize the Gounod hero
last evening in song.
So, and therefore, the goodly audience
trooped down Kearny street, then three
blocks up Market, and such as could be
accommodated lined up in the aisles at
the other house. It's an ill wind that
blows nobody good. '
And at the Tivoli was to be heard
Slgnor Russo's Interpretation of the
Faust role for the first time this season,
an eminently musical rendering, but
lacking a little in seriousnessâ weight.
The California announces another little
change for this evening, "Norma," with

Hughes Was a Sard I>rinker.
Detective Tom Gibson says James
Hughes, whose ravings about the alleged
murder of a man named O'Brien In Golden
Gate Park caused him to be taken from
the transport Thomas and held in jail at
Honolulu, was evidently suffering from an
attack of delirium tremens when making
his wild talk. No such murder ever oc
curred, but Hughes, 'who Â¦was a barkeeper
for Al Connors (not his partner, as
stated), was a hard drinker before he
stowed away on the Thomas. That is the
substance of the report made by Gibson
to Captain Seymour last night.

EXPECTING A VISIT FROM DETECTIVES
To-day it is more than possible that the
physicians at the hospital will allow the
long lost and supposedly dead husband to
see the afflicted woman, and there are
hopes that the meeting will have a bene

mind to its normal condition and heal the
wounds caused by her great grief.

"About a week since I was sitting in
the house on Natoma street alone and
saw my daughter come up and ring the
front door bell. There was nobody in the
house with me, and as I did not want the
folks to know where I was I did not an
swer the bell. If I had known what a
tragedy could have been averted by the
knowledge that I was in the city I would
have let them know of my whereabouts."
H. M. Finger, a brother of Mrs. Curran,
and who was the person who waa instru
mental in the detention of the atdicted
woman at the Receiving Hospital, is also
the guardian of the Curran children by
the order of the court. He had the two
boysâ Frank, aged 15, and Harry, aged 13
âplaced In the Youths' Directory, but
early yesterday in some manner they got
out and accompanied their mother to the
City Hall. The daughter, Mabel, also
formed one of the party. During the ex
amination of her mother the girl con
versed with the attaches of the hospital
and informed them that she waa about to
marry Charles McGreavy, who is the son
of a policeman, just as soon as he could
rais^ the money. The girl claimed that
the object of her uncle in swearing out
the warrant was that he wished to ob
tain guardianship of her person, a con
nection that was distasteful to her, as he
had threatened to kill her if she pe;jlsted
in marrying McGreavy.
Mrs. Curran, who is a little woman
about 45 years of age, before being taken
to the Receiving Hospital haunted the
Central Police Station and the Morgue
for several days. One moment she would
beg the Coroner's deputies to. exhume the
body of her child that she lost about a
year ago, and the next she would appear
at the office of the police and teaxfully
THREE MEMBERS OF THE CURRAN* FAMILT WHO ARE THE PRIX
CIPAL ACTORS IX A PATHETIC DOMESTIC TRAGEDY. THE
MOTHER IS IN A PADDED CELL AT THE RECEIVING HOSPITAL.
MRS. L. B. SKELTON. who con
ducts a saloon at CentraJ av
enue and Sutter street, has a
gift of good looks that is fatal
to men. The records of the
Police Court show that any number of
males have been, driven to drink by her
fatal beauty; that it has caused her hus
band not only to separate from her but
to. put a bullet into his successor in her
affections; that this successor has been
pupplanted by another, and that a police
man has not only lost blood at her shrine,
but Is liable to lose his place on the force.
The latest chapter in the life of Mrs.
Skc'.ton was written yesterday in Judge
Fritz's division of the Police Court, when
J. Snowgrass stood at the bar to plead
to a charge of assault with a deadly
weapon upon Policeman F. C. Howard.
The trouble occurred early yesterday
morning at Mrs. Skelton's saloon. Snow
prass, who served with the First Cali
fornia Regiment in the Philippines, and
Oharles Batterock, a friend, wont into
the saloon shortly after midnight. But
terock's intention being to stop all night
In one of the rooms of the lodging
house attached to the saloon. They
had been drinking and both fell
asleep on a lounge. Snowgrass says he
was awakened by a severe punch m the
Jaw. He jumped to his feet and was con
fronted by Howard, who was in civilian's
clothes, having reported off duty at the
Central police station at midnight.
Snowprass asked Howard why he had
struck him. and was gruffly told to "get
out." There was a scuffle and Jn the con
fusion Qnowgrass got hold of Howard's
hat. He and his friend Batterock were
hustled out and when they got to the
street Snowprass discovered he had the
wrong hat. He asked a special policeman
to get him his hat, but the latter refused
and Snowgrass went back to the saloon
himself.
Howard met him at the door, and re
marking. "So you won't go awav?"
struck at him with his closed fist. Snow
grass pays he had his pocket-knife in his
hand, as he was cutting his nails, and he
raised his hand with the knife to ward
off the blow. Just then Howard yelled.
I m cut." and Snowgrass saw * blood
pouring from a wound In his left cheek
Sergeant Burnett and Policeman Doyle
came along and Howard asked them to
arrest Snowgrass on a charge of assault
with a deadly weapon. Howard went to
Dr. Shumate's residence on Devisadero
street and the doctor stitched and dressed
the wound in his cheek. He then went
to his home at 142 Second avenue.
"hen Snowgrass appeared before Judge
Fritz yesterday morning the case was con
tinued till to-day, as no complaint had
been sworn to, Howard having been un
able to leave his home. Snowgrass is a
brother-in-law of Attorney Frank Dunne
Sergeant Burnett reported the facts to
Captain Wittman. who notified Chief Sul
livan. The captain was instructed to pre
fer charges against Howard before the
Police Commissioners. It Is also within
the range of probability that Mrs. Skelton
will lose her liquor license. It is only a
few weeks ago that her husband shot J
A Schaertzer Jr.. assistant clerk in the
united States District Court, because he
was tco familiar with his wife. Schaert
zer refused to prosecute the case and it
was dismissed.
Snowgrass -was released late in the aft
ernoon on a bond of $500 furnished by Abe
Levy of 2264 rsuph street and J. E. Mc-
Cormack of 202S Sutter street.

A STARTLING chapter in the com
plicated domestic history of the
Currans was unfolded yesterday,
in which the tragic and the pa
thetic are closely interwoven feat
ures. First was the reappearance of
Frank J. Curran, whose dead body was
reported to have been found a few days
ago in the woods on the outskirts of Santa
Rosa. Curran's action in coming to the
front to deny the report that he had com
mitted suicide because of a quarrel with
his wife following the reported elopement
of his seventeen-year-old daughter with
Charles McGreavy, was sadly ill-timed.
He should not have delayed the announce
ment of his being still in the flesh so long.
The shock of his supposed suicide, to
gether with the worry occasioned by the
behavior* of their daughter, prostrated
Mrs. Curran, and within a few hours of
Curran's reappearance on the scene and
before the welcome information ot his
safety had been made Known to her the
unfortunate woman was an occupant of
a padded cell in the insane ward of the
Receiving Hospital, a raving maniac.
The Currans, up till a few months ago.
were a happy family, but then a shadow
of gloom was cast over the home by their
eldest daughter, Mabel, a pretty girl
seventeen years old, going to live with a i
man named Charles McGreavy. The par
ents were brokenhearted and spent their
modest savings that had been put away
for a rainy day traveling over the State
trying to find their wayward daughter.
One evening after a fruitless search the
Currans returned to tlieir house at 416
Ivy avenue and in a fit of anger Curran
said that his children gave him so much
trouble that he felt sometimes as if he
could kill the whole family. Several days
afterward Mrs. Curran had him arrested
for these hasty words and the case came
up in Judge Cabaniss' court. Curran waa
discharged by the court with a suggestion
that if he could not live happily with his
wife they ought to- live apart. He took
the Judge's advice and quietly disap
peared. But this is a large city and in
stead of going away Into the country as
his family supposed he took up his abode
with some of his relatives at 521& Natoma
street, where he was seen last night by
a Call reporter and spoke freely on the
circumstances that had culminated in this
sad domestic tragedy.
"I am almost brokenhearted," he said.
"After the episode In the Police Court I
decided that I would follow the Judge's
advice and leave my wife. For three
weeks I have lived with relatives on Na
toma street and have been* fairly happy.
I am employed as a waiter and do not
have much time to read the newspapers
and did not know until I casually picked
up The Call to-day that I was believed to
be dead and that my body was supposed
to be lying in the woods back of Santa
Rosa, I had to work to-day and Just
heard that my wife has gone insane. 1

ments might be repudiated and the plant
would then revert to the companv and
the city would be out and Injured. Under
the charter a franchise to erect poles and
wires would have to be granted and the
offer of the company contemplated that it
would receive the franchise and then
construct and sell the pole line system to
the city.
Attorney Lloyd thought there were no
legal objections to paying municipal
obligations in installments, but he de
clined to give his opinion on the merit of
the proposed system until it had assumed
more definite shape.
Preston said that after the City Engi
neer had prepared plans for the system
bids would be invited and the plan Â¦would
then be submitted to the people. Auditor
Wells said there would be no surplus
available until the end of the fiscal year.
The Mayor thought that all the difficul
ties in the way of the acquisition of the
plant could be obviated by the issuance
of bonds. He thought there would be no
opposition to such an issuance on account
of the small amount involved. The con
ference then adjourned after general ap
proval of the propose pole line system
had been expressed by all the city offi
cials present.

An Important conference was held in
the Mayor's office yesterday for the pur
pose of considering the offer of Claus
Spreckels, made through the Independent
Electric Light and Power Company, to
sell to the city a pole line system for the
electric lighting of public streets. The
offer contemplates the erection of the
necessary poles and wires for $225,000
actual cost, which will then allow com
petitive bidding for the electric current
.to be supplied to the system.
There were present at the conference,
Mayor Phelan, Auditor Wells, his attor
ney. Reuben H. Lloyd; Supervisors Con
nor, Reed, Dwyer, Jennings, Comte, Mc-
Carthy, Hotaling, General Manager Hunt
of the Independent Electric Light and
Power/Company and Attorney E. F.
Presto if.
Attorney Preston addressed the con
ference and outlined the legal status of
the offer made by the Independent Com
pany. He said that the system could be
acquired by the city in one of two ways,
one by the issuance of bonds, the other by
paying for it out of the excess revenues
of the city resulting from the increased
assessed valuation, which was provided
for by. the charter.
"The underlying thought in this offer
made by Mr. Claus Spreckels," said
Preston, "is to make San Francisco the
best illuminated city in the world. But,
as there is danger of the city defaulting
in the payment of one of the three in
stallments of $75,000 each, the title in the
plant would have to remain with the com
pany until the last payment had been
made."
Auditor Wells was of the opinion that
the franchise for the system should be
open to competition and Preston said if
the Independent Company was underbid
for the privilege it could not construct
the plant.
Reed said that the company had offer
ed to furnish arc lights for 27U cents,
against 4214 cents now charged in cer
tain districts, if it was granted the fran
chise. In three years the plant would bo
paid for at a cost of $225,000, whereas it
now costs an average of $300,000 per year
to light the city. Preston stated that If
the city should default in its payments
the ownership of the pole line system
would revert to the company. The city,
however, would have the use of the plant
until such default.
Mayor Phelan doubted whether tho pre
sent Board of Supervisors could bind its
successors to pay any sum of money.
There was danger then that the install-
