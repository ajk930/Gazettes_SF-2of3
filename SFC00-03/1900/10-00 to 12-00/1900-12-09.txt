dozens of -ibrettos, some elegantly bound
and carefully preserved, but- now musty
with age. All the blank space In the books
was covered with clippings from Euro
pean papers recounting his brilliant suc
cesses. One described his triumph at the
Kscurlal Palace. Madrid, where he sang
before Queen Isabella II. Another men

particularly the Czarina with his songs.
Herr Moosbrugger seemed .to enjoy this
recollection. ". .., 3
"Oh, the impress, she was beautiful â
beautifully musical!" and the old man
lapsed into silence for a moment as he
dreamed over again a scene long past.
One of the librettos â¢ contained a state

(who ruled 'the musical society of Mann-
helm), pronouncing him the finest singer
of classical music, his repertoire embrac

Mozart and Bach. â¢, ,â¢
It was evident from the notes through
out the librettos that he had mastered
them all. When - 1 first glanced at these
books I had dared to wonder why Herr
Moosbrugger had not sold them to keep

understood why he had held them dear.
He is out 'of the race now, for age has
overtaken - him and the great operatic
world heedlessly continues in its course.

cf Europe's celebrities in a San
Francisco almÂ«house! Yet. it is
an established fact that Herr
Freflertch Moosbrug-ger, a famous Ger
man tenor, known on the operatic stage
as 'Brueci." although admired by ihe
royalty of the Old World because of his
beautiful voice, called Lord Chesterfield
because of bis culture and elegance of
manner, a master of French %nd German,
end. genius with bis brush and palette,
he now finds his way to an almshouse
aJone in h!s old age.
"Over the hills to the poorhouse!" Hew
often we have read this pathetic poem
without thinking it might mean cur own
future. Herr Moosbrugger himself read
a translation of this poem of Carleton's
â¢when it first appeared, little dreaming:
that his own brilliant career would end in
this saddest of events, a disconsolate ride
to the almshouse. We know that every
one dies alone, but there are certainly
other times in our lives when we could
rot be more solitary, and such a Journey
la one of them.
Twice a week the county wagon ratUes
up to the San Francisco City Hall to take
any unfortunates who have proved to be
In Btich a need. A once proud but now
brokea spirit drags himself into this con
veyance because such a step seems the
only antithesis to suicide, which would
b* cowardly.
The ride to the almsho'jse is a long one,
fraught with recollections of the life be
hind us. the past with Its lights and shad
dtyws. its triumphs and its dark contrasts.
We recall it now with a clearness and
forcefulness that is equaled only by our
realizalior of what we have finally come
to. So black are the screens of memory
that they shut out the brightness of tha
funshine about us. The wagon rumbles
on and en. outside the. city and over the
hills toward charity. The driver's loud
and careless words cf encouragement only
cause us to shrink more within ourselves,
thinking- he cannot know as well as -we
where he is t .iking us and what humility
is ours.
We feel no gratitude; If we could we
might be ab!e to*' see beauty in the clear
blue cf the sky and the graceful green
covered hills studded with raindrops
which fparkle in the smiles of sunlight;
but to us now the serenity seems a taunt
ing mockery that hurts our already shat
tered feelings. We have eyes only for the
barren bits of stubble that we pass, or a
tree that has been vested of Its leaves
arfl robbed of Its life; but the tree is
epared the knowledge of its Blow decay,
v.hile we must face the consciousness of
our despair.
There are few people of fine nature*,
however, who climb out of the county
wagon and enter the Aimhouse with as
much grace and courage as did the once
proud-spirited Herr Moosbrugger. This
msn. who was once a welcome guest of
royalty, passed up the steps to San Fran
cisco's home for the poor a few weeks
ago with the same dignity that character
ized his calls at Buckingham Palace; for
It Is true that this individual used to visit
Queen Victoria end the Prince of Wales
at their request, sometimes as often as
twice a week. The Queen admired the
beautiful quality of his voice and loved
to hear him eing while he played his own
accompaniments with exquisite harmony.
He was perfectly at home in the imperial
palace. He is now at home in the Alms-
house.
Herr Mocsbrugger's arrival startled
even the managers of the institution, who
ree many of the tragedies of life. He was
a distinguished-looking man of perhaps
revertty-five years, wearing an opera coal
with the cape gracefully thrown back, a
tilk hat, gold sleeve-buttons and carrying
a cane. How could he be in want? But.
on closer observation, one observed the
bat to be much the worse for wear, his
Eboefl shabby, his linen badly worn and
soiled, and worse than all, the man was
starving â starving in a strange land.
So this prince oi paupers took up his
sbode with the scores of other unfortu
nates about him, and, having a remark
ar>ie dis=pos=iton. he put away his pride and
Rocd-naturedly adapted himself to cir
cumstances.
When Hrrr Moosbrugger was presented
to rac a day or two ago by a man in
of thÂ«; Almshouse, he still wore the
old opera coat and silk hat, which only
served to contrast more forcibly their
owner's past and present and to empha
size more strongly his unkempt appear
ance. For he still looked neglected, al
though his physical wants had been sup
plied and the wornout linen had been re
placed by a coarse gray flannel Fbirt.
There were, no gold sleeve-buttons now,
and no tie. F.Â»s chin was unshaven and
Ms ccat soiled and unbrushed, but I was
j>rond to take his hand, a. soft, fine hand
that kings had gladly shaken while thf-y
praised his genius in years gone by.
The venerable gallant removed his hat
â¢with his left hand and held It gracefully
tilted against his shoulder. If he wa.s
ashamed of his appearance his embar
rassment was overshadowed by courtcfy.
Kis clothes were no longer presentable,
but his manner showed that innate pcllu
cees which age cannot dim.
Herr Moosbrugger greeted me in Ger
man I did not understand, but his wel
come was easily apparent in his yolce ant
bearing. His charm and suavity of man-
Tier was such as one might have expected
from Ix>rd Chesterfield under the most
favorable circumstances, but scarcely Id
an almshouse. :'*'.
And the eyes of this aged knight! They
were the clearest, brightest, bluest eyes
I have ever seen. They were a ready in
dex to his frank, honest character and in
dicated a life free from dissipation but'
devoted to the earnest, careful working
out of bis ideals prompted by the fire of
genius.
Improbable as it may appear, Herr
Moosbrugger has proved an honor to his
old historical family in the Austrian
Tyrol, noted far its longr line of artists,
beginning with Angelica Kaufraann, who
was the first woman to become famous
ass a portrait painter. It was Moosbrug
ger who sang in the Initial production of
Wagner's "Tannhauser" in the Royal
Theater at Karlsruhe and won distinction.
He then went to Stuttgart to Bins at the
etate concert given by the King of Wurt
k temberg. After a successful concert tour
* through Germany, Herr Moosbrugger
went to Paris, bearing introduction* from
Queen Olga of Wurttemberg-, Count and
Countess Ingleheim. Prlnca Weimar and
The contents of the trunk indicated that
their owner had traversed the gamut of
life from the heights of luxury to the
depths of despair. There were choice pic
tures that had belonged* to his wife: a
dusty black velvet coat of the style gen
tlemen of leisure wore about the house a
score of years ago; old books with in-
"Just look at the size of it." said on<Â»
of the inmates. "It took three men to
carry it in. Mighty seldom a person
comes to the Aimshouse with a big trunk
like that; or. in fact, any trunk at all."
The old man had come to America to
spend his old age with hJs son, Au?u?t
Mocsbrugger, who is decidedly more than
a. prodigal, for he secured the last two
remittances sent his father for the salo
of property in Germany, squandered tho
money, refused to recognize filial duty
and made himself comfortable In Oak
land, where he is to-day. In the mear.
time Herr Moosbrujrger senior struggled
for over a year trying to get pupils for
French and German. He roomed with a
Nichols family at the corner of Van Ne.ss
avenue and Sutter street. San Francisco,
but fell behind with his rent and was com
pelled to take up his abode in the Alms
house.
At the close of my interview with Herr
Moosbrugger som^ one in charge of the
institution suggested my looking through
the old man's trunk, adding that it was
most interesting. Herr Moosbrugger no
ticed my hesitation (for such an act
seemed to me a sacrilege) and assured mo
I v.'as most welcome to examine his treas
ures. "Your pleasure, madam," ha added,
waving me toward them In a manner that
convinced me again. that true politeness is
only kindness.
"But how could such a conscientiously
directed list come to this destination?" I
asked the interpreter, aud learned the
reason:
When it became known to the people of
Melbourne that this white haired tnan
was "Brucci," the operatic songster. th2v
insisted upon a public appearance ani
gave him a great ovation. Herr Moos
brugger finally decided to remain in that
city and for several years he taught
voice, as well as painting on wood and
china.
In fact this English Earl sent his son
to Paris to be educated, explaining: "My
idea is to unite in him what has never
been found in one person beforeâ I mean
the best qualities of the two nations."
In the character of Herr Moosbrugger
we have that rare combination, the stolid-'
Ity and thoroughness of a German and the
tact and politeness of a Frenchman, this
latter quality being increased by his al
most constant association with the people
of that nation, for "Brucci" returned to
France after his London tour and re
mained untilit became unsafe for him to
live in Paris because of the trouble wag-
Ing between their two countries, ,
-Moosbrurgwthefl: returned to Germanv
and bought a villa on the shore of the
Koenigsee. The singer's health had faile 1
and he sought to regain it in the moun
tain air of the Tyrol. He lived happily
here with his wife and two children, fre
quently receiving such celebrities as
Clara Schumann, Aglaja Orgeni, Desire
Artot. Frau Joachim and Max Grube.
Some years later Herr Moosbrugger'3
wife and daughter died and he became a
broken hearted man. Wishing to leavÂ«i
the scene of his wrecked happiness, he
left with his son for Australia, where ha
traveled for three years, painting: the
flora Indigenous to that country for a
German firm.
"I am being often taken for a French
man, and more than one of them has paid"
me the highest possible compliment by
saying: 'Monsieur, you are quite ona of
ourselves." "
Then I remembered that Lord Chester
field, to whom Herr Moosbrugger was
compared, has written:
And the old man, looking ay-ay into the
past, rang softly agSln that romance. It
was interesting to watch the light in his
face and eyes. His voice had gone with
the years, but his love and enthusiasm
returned with memory.
Suddenly coming back to the present,
Herr Moosbrugger asked my pardon for
having forgotten himself bo far as to sing.
So graceful was his apology that I was
forced to remark the French courtliness
of this German.
"I like politeness," he said (although
needlessly). "The most Ideal gentleman I
ever had the honor to know was Capoul
He was beautifully artistic on the stage

it is not so easy to serve a dinner In a

of ours sectarian strifes and Jealousies
have robbed the childhood, and youth of
the nation by excluding from our pub
lic schools the legitimate influence of the
best moral classics In the literature of tho

has been minimized and often even poi

championed Its own little creed as the

ennobling power of the Christian religion
upon society lies not In the promotion of
uniform doctrinal opinions among/Chris

platform of the love of God and tha

all churches might unite if they could but
forget their petty differences. The world's
greatest need to-day Is the active moral
influence that would result from such uni

some lofty moral purpose and they will
concentrate upon that purpose impassion

display of what can be accomplished by a
concentration of spiritual energy upon the

around" that constituted the spiritual
paradise of the Puritans. To them that
snug little inclosttre was the only pure
and safe place, all space outside being
full of wickedness and ravaged by the
"roaring lion seeking whom he might de
vour," but to the modern successors of
the Puritans the whole "earth is the
Lord's and the fullness thereof, the world
and they that dwell therein"â a doctrine
which, properly understood, comprises the
whole system of Christian truth with all
its worship and all its personal and so
cial obligations in the direction of rght
eousnesp. If this is unbelief, then such
men 'as Frederick \V. Robertson. Henry
Ward Beechef. Robertson Smith. Pro
fessor Briggs and Dwight Hillls must be
classed as unbelievers.
The day of written creeds has gone by
and the dawn of a nobler day appears.
Little by little the religious world is com
ing to perceive that the Idea of intellec
tual agreement among * Christians upon
doctrinal . theories and opinions Is a
Â¦wretched delusion and a fatal snare. As
part of this discovery comes the vision
rtdual thought upon religious matters by
orecting some supposed standard of doc
trine than -you could stop the flight of
time by means of a board fence. The aim
of the creed revisers is S3 hopelessly out
cf date that even if they should be able
to sÂ«j manipulate the Â¦ ecclesiastical ma
chine as to accomplish it the success
could only be a sham. In the past men
have subscribed to creeds because, their
neighbor's did so and for various reasons
that have lone; lost* their former value;
In the future men. will refuse to do so
because among other reasons uniformity
of doctrinal opinion Is no longer possi
ble, and personal enualion has become a
factor in the reckoning. The Protestants'
traditional motto represents a purpose not
yet achieved so long aa a man-made creed
is allowed to stand between him and
"the Open Bible."
One of the stigmas hurled by traditional
orthodoxy against the free spirit wheih
chafes at creeds is tho charge of unbe
lief. This is a very blind sort of mis
take. In truth, the freer the rnlnd of a
truly religious man from the trammels of
traditional opinion and prescribed doc
trine the larger and deeper and stronger
will be his f tilth. He believes not less,"
but more than his orthodox neighbor, and
he believes H^more thoroughly and more
heartily. The more and farther a man
sees the larger and fuller and more nat-
The main plea in favor of a written
creed in the contention that Biblical state
ments are capable of various Interpreta
tions; that asp<?nt to a written creed guar
antees common agreement, and that with
out it a veritable babel of doctrinal con
fusion must ensue. This contention Is
plausible in theory, but of very little ac
count in fact, ignoring, as it doss, the
immense and force of individual
ism In modern thought. You can no more
arrest the incessant movement of Indl-
Â«=jp=IIE world surely noves 1 New illus
trations of this tr'te truth are com-
Ing into view every day. Among
them is the stir about questions
theological, which is now making things
lively in Presbyterian church circles all
over this cour.try. There is some vigorous
kicking- being cone against the revolting
dogznes of infant damnation; predestina
tion and totul depravity, together, with
other theological fictions which have come
down to us from mere superstitious tiir.es.
And thereby har.gs a chapter of Puritan
church history which it xcay be interest
ing to glance at.
On July 1, 1C43, Idv the authority cf the
Ensllsh Parliament was convened that
noted and historic convocation known as
the Westminster Assembly of Divines. It
consisted of 121 of the ablest ecclesiastics
of England, with thirty lay assessors, and
the ta.=k set for it to accomplish was the
settlement for all future generations of
the government, worship and discipline
of the Church of Kngland! So far as the
first part of its task was concerned, the
assembly proved a brilliant failure, for al
though Its members were nearly all Pres
byterians the constitution of the Church
of Ecglar.d iemained Kpiscopalian and
still remains so. But the work for which
the assembly became noted in church his
tory w as Its construction of those erudite
theological documents knovn as "The
Confession of Faith" and the "Larger and
Shorter Catechisms.? These "Westmin
ster Standards," as they are generally
termed, have constituted In substance the
creed of Protestant Christendom for more
than -JO years. The forging cf this creed
Â¦was a warm piece of business, and the
welding of Us successive links meant
much hard hammering; but r.o more
splendid product of elaborate creed-mak
ing exists iii the entire literature of
Protestant Christerdom. This 1? the creed
which is disturbing Presbyterian and
ether churches of this country to-day,
and the disturbance is growing apace.
The trouble Is that many urofess-icnal ec
clesiastics favor a creed as a dignified
essential of an ecclesiastical system,
â¢while the more progressive utilitarian
laity would relegate It to tome museum
of antiquated curios. Strong antagonisms
result and bitterness is oftor. engendered
â¢which is entirely out of harmony with the
essential spirit of the Christian religion.
In the Intervals of strife, however, there
occur periods of reflection, and out of
such reflection arise pertinent questions
as to the whence and wherefore of all
â¢written creeds. Not only so, but these
questions are belnjj answered with om
lnous disregard for ecclesiastical authori
ties. The oid jcrecd being virtually a dead
letter, the precise question s.bout which
the Presbyterian churches of this country
are disturbed just row is whether they
ehall bur;- it or let it lie uncared for or
try to galvanize Jt into life by a process
called "revision." The revision proposed,
however, is hopelessly telated; happily no
propesed settlement In that direction, could
last ten years. An agitation of- the- near
future, -which lndetd Is already overdue,
will be determinedly aimed at the entire
abolition of all written creeds as a neces
earr etcp toward the liberation of cur-
they bad and the views of God ami the
human race which such knowledge'ren
dered possible. But we have knowledge
which they diJ not pofposs. Not only ha*;

THE SUNDAY CALL.

GETTING up and serving a dinner
outside 'of one's province, so to
speak, is not so easy as one may
suppose. To serve a dinner In the
Waldorf-Astoria to any number' of per
sons is simple in comparison. Years ago
if a man contemplated giving a dinner to
several friends he felt he must give It In
his own house; so he -vould send for some
caterer, make his wants known, have an
estimate made, and after settling a few
details the order would be given and the
caterer took charge of everything, even
to the decorations. Frequently, from an
artistic viewpoint, such dinners were dire
failure?, and that Is why the custom of
entertaining one's friends In hotels has
become almost universal. In his own
house a man feels responsible for every
thing, and naturally would be more or
less anxious and perhaps a blt'nervous.
Of course, you know, he could not say to
his guests, "If this dinner Is not all right
I am not responsible. I employed a cater
er to serve it."
When the dinner Is given here or In any
of the well-known hotels or restaurants
In town the host is comparatively > free
from anxiety, as he knows It will be all
right. In these days of almost perfect
system In hotels It Is really better for. a
man to entertain his friends In a hotel.

Well/ the first question I Sliould ask
him would be: "Are the gentlemen who
are to dino with you Americans? If not,
what Is their nationality?"* For according
to their nationality I should be guided in
making up my menu. If they were Eng
lish I _ would, of course, have a roast of
â¢beef, as no Englishman thinks he has
dined unless he has roast beef. ~
The custom of serving a different soit
of wine for every course Is a thing of the
past. Only two kinds are now servedâ
champagne, which comes on justafter the
oysters, and Burgundy, which 'should be
served with, the gnme. Of course, the
particular brand of wine Is a matter of
taste and would be selected by the host.
December is the ideal / month In which
to give a dinner; the markets are replete
with everything that Is good and game
of all sorts is In prime condition. Now.
a couple, or perhaps four or five, days be
fore the evening of the dinner I would
visit the house of the gentleman who
gtves the dinner, so that I could see the
size of the dining room, the sort of table,
the style and color scheme of the decora
tions In order to make my "table linen,
nÂ»" china, glass and other items of ser
.vlce harmonize and to know how to suit
m- floral decorations to the room and to
see where they were to be placed. I would
take a look at the reception room and
Intend the service. If the host preferred
I would have his linen, silver, glass, etc..
used, but would much rather use my cwn.
I would have the oysters at each plate
a minute before the guests were seated.
Before they were finished I would- have
the champagne poured. The latest glass
is the revival of the old flaring top glass
with the slender stem. One minute after
the oysters were removed the soup would
be served, and one after the other th<*
courses would follow In not too precipi
tate haste. The grapo fruit salad should
be served in the rind of the fruit, cut Into
pretty shapes. The name of each guest,
on a card, should be laid In the place
where he Is to sit. This, of course. Is
selected by the host. A small bouton
nlere should be laid by each card. Bur
gundy now Is served In small round
glasses with slender stems. The .meats
and game should be carved at side tables
and the salad service placed on a side
table. Relishes, such as olives, celery
salted almonds, must be placed In silver
or glass dishes on the table: butter on a
side table. Ice and -water carafes on the
sideboard; champagne In coolers and the
Burgundy must bo set In the sun during
the afternoon to give it tho desired tem
perature. Coffee and cigars -would be
served In the smoking room.
I would have my crew remove every
article of service from the house, and
have the dining room and kitchen In per

To the student of politics this history is
a valuable one, and is really a masterful
effort of St. Amand. but the casual reader
will most'ltkely find It not so entertaining
as some other biographies of Napoleon
III. The translation is ably done by Eliz
abeth St. Gilbert-Martin. There are four
"Devoted to free trade Ideas, he thought '
that by the commercial treaty < he. had
sown seeds from which "immeflse and
beneficent harvests would be reaped. For
humanity he dreamed of tlwi'cess'ation-of r
the age of Iron and the coming of the a.gey
of gold. As everything had succeeded with
him from the beginning of his^ reign, he
believed that his eagles soared *a"bove the
lightning. Happy husband, happy father,
happy sovereign, he peacefully enjoyed a
situation so widely different from the
painful trials of his childhood and youth.
He looked forward to the future with con
fidence, and believed more than ever in
his star." Here St. Amand leaves him be- '
fore the star in which Napoleon had so
much hope finally went down behind that
dark horiron. - " ,
France under him undoubtedly occupied
a leading position in the world, the eyes of
all Europe were turned upon her and her
power* was felt in Italy, Syria and far-off
China. . . /
The "Hiftory of the Third Napoleon," by
Imbcrt dc St. Amand, opens at the com
mencement of the year 1SW. when he had
reached the zenith of his glorj'. It deals
alone wiih the political life and acts of the
sovereign. St. Amand touches lightly
upon his personal history. By observing
closely, however, his career in politics one,
finds him throughout possessed with sym
pathy for the laboring and suffering
elapsesâ a philanthropist always and a' hu
manitarian. As a statesman his ability
was rnuch more than the average. St.
Amand says: "The speeches from the
throne were always an event. Napoleon
III writing them himself nnd correcting
the proofs with tho utmost care. Pleasing
his self-love as a sovereign and a writer,
in their composition, he delivered them
afterward in a sonorous voice. As formal
manifestations of the imperial mind, they
were in striking contrast with the com
monplaces of other sovereigns on simSlar
occasions. They nearly always expressed
Kreat ideas in an imposing and really
masterly style." v- :.

The other characters are entertaining
enough to play well their parts in the ro
mance, but after all Mrs. Steel is at her

Besides the Catholic priest. Father
Hruce, who has lived in India long enough
to '.earn that he must endeavor to under
stand lints of thought which he cannot
hor-c to change, the other interesting
character o{ the novel is a young Indian
oflicer, educated at a initslon school nnd
trained in the army, who thinks himself
thoroughly loyal to the British interests
and who acknowledges that the Knglish
are better rulers for India than natives
could he. When he has cause to hate lh?
Knclish for seme fancied wrong, lo! his
Western culture disappears and he is the
Lereditary enemy of the foreigners with
all the dominant passions of his race
aroused against them. When reading of
such a man. one with the training of the
European, but â¢with the nature and preju
dices of the Asiatic, one wonders if
things so dissimilar can ever blend in a
real harmony.
Thf love story, or rather tho two love
s-tories of the book, become of s-?c^n4.ir/

Hit. Steel aÂ« ?lie writes behind and bc
ynrxl the separate little dramas enacted
by her character?, of tho larger dra-na of

In his Hoiked Individuality, with his poor
little loves and hates, swept along by the
hand of an unlimited Fate, seems to
exert a dea.u'eninjj influence upon all who
fall under the spell of the mysticism of
the East! Perhaps this may explain why
Mrs. Steel draws her characters as if she
had always in mir.d the futility of human
effort and Its insignificance when viewed
against the greater workings of Destiny.'
However that may be. there are few who
write about India as doÂ»s* Mrs. Steel â with
the power of the Anplo-Saxon* and yet
with a sympathy for the point of view of
the Orientalist, v.hich at times amounts
almost to a fellow-feeling-. Others thero
are who recogmize the irreconcilable an
tagonism between the materialism of the
one and the mysticism of the other, and
who make a patronizing: allowance f r .T
it. but between recognition of certain
traits H^human nature and sympathetic
appreciation of them there is a vast dif
ference.
The plot hap been sketched in bares f
outline. Filling this in. in detail, are
situations of the stronjrept dramatic 'In
terest. Mrs. Steel's Imagination Is too
vivid, if anything. Tho trader Is hur
ried filonsr with such rapidity- from one
tJirilline episode to another that his emo

hieh.
And g great hush came. The sound of blows,
of iron clashing on Iron and falling with a
dull thud on something softer, siremed to 111
the world and leave room for nothins Hse.
The door was not four yards from him. but
the crowd was not one. There v.-as no time.
"Shut It." he called. 1 "I'm all rlsht."
Eugene Smith stood uncertain, the door
ajar. .'
The keys! Ah', what could he do with the
keys If he went back to hrlp?â and If not-; â
"Oh! !>leaee shut It. Smith', there's a good
frllcw; please."
The foiir yurd^ were two now; were one.
Thf-n slowly the door closed, and Vincent had
his tack asair.st It.
Vincent Derlng rave one sharp look around.
The lane was very narrow. Three men could
barely brea*t It rhoulder to shoulder. Surely
one could bar it by swift blows and slow iv
treat! For a time, at any rateâ time for the
opening and shutting of a door! He could but
try.
So. retreating, Â»tep by step. Vincent Derins
kept the crowd back, lured the crowd on, safeâ
*o far! For these, the first, the swiftest, were
naturally the unlroned. therefore the unarcnÂ«l.
Hut there were others forcing their way to the
front who would be harder to deal with. I
Vincent threw his head back and wondered
bow Eugene was faring; for he dared not turn
his face from his task even for a 'second.
Had those three been caught up? Had the
kukri helped?
It had. And one of those three had fallen be- v
fore a Rash, as of light.
And another!
But the third bad the key in the door; had
turned it. when Eugene struck him from be
hind. With a wild yell he flung his full weight
on the door; it burst open, and the two fell
headlong into the tower beyond.
But only for a second. Eugene Smith' was up
again, had the key out. and in on the further
side.
"All right:" he shouted; "make a rush for.
It! I'm ready!"

"l ( -Â¦Â» Â»'ERTBODY has seen dolls th.it
p^ 3 looked real enough to be children.
I j JCow we have seen children v;ho
looked real enough to bo dolls.
They ere the children of St. Mark's
Church, In Berkeley, and they have been
"every child his own rag doll." If. you
had seen them propped up against th"
wall with their lcÂ£s as stiff as ramrods
and their arms bowed out like the arm*
of the tongs-rack, you never would haTÂ»
dreamed that they were stuffed with
boys and girls instead of with sawdust.
The idea of a live rag-doll show popped
Into the head of Mrs. O. G. Wright only
two weeks before its execution. Presto!
She had gathered more than fifty children
together before you could say Jack Rob
inson, and for the two weeks following
she spent the most cf her time In teach
ing them to be stuffed rag dolls Instead of
treal flesh and blood boys and girls. JCo-,
"body could have invented anything harder'
to do. There Isn't a boy or sirl In all
Berkeley that doesn/t like better to
squirm like an eel than to bo still. But
they learned in time,' and they found out
flow it feels to be the doll. *. .'
There were dolls of all kindsâ enough t)
fill all the Christmas trees in town. It's a
lucky thing for them that Santa Claus
didn't happen along -while their 'doll
ehow was in progress. It was too early
In the season for himâ just before
Thanksciving. Except for that there
isn't the shadow of a doubt that h<Â» would
have picked up Ramnna McChar.e or
Jewr-li Allen or Olive Wright or some
other human dolls and carried them off
in his reindeer sleigh. Then think of the
horrid sooty trip tney would have had
down somobody"s chimney, and how they
would have been smothered in some
body's stocking cr left dangling by the
neck on somebody's tree: No fun, you
may be assured. â¢
Such neatly dressed dolls as they were!
There were Japs in flowing kimonos, with
their sash bows pinned up as high as
their shoulders and their hair stuck full
of fans. Elaine and Ramona McChane
were more fortunate than the rest in
having real Japanese gowns. The way
they came to have them Is that they ustfd
to live in Japan themselves. They lived
and dresyed in American fashion, to bÂ«
sure, but they brought homo many rou
venlrs, and amen; them -were some em
broiilcred Japanese costumes. They an:
heavily quilted, that 'they may hang
more gracefully. )
The pickaninnies were a Jolly lot of
dolls. They sanR coon songs. That io
doing a good deal for dolls, isn't It? Most
of us think we are lucky to have one that
can say "Mamma" or "Papa." or even
cry; but think of a doll that can sins
"Punkin' fcolored Coons" and "Just Be
cause You Made Them Goo-Goo Eyes!"
If some wide awake boys and girls had
not been 'inside them they never couM
have done it. j
The Quaker dolls were the most demure 1
oi the lot. They were dressed in simple
little gray gowns, with plain handker-*
chiefs folded about their, necks and big
bonnets almost hiding their rosy clotli
faces. They looked like the Quaker-doll
pincushions that used to be fashionable.
What- would they have said If somebody
had mistaken them and stuck in plna?
The- Dutchmen were the chubbiest lot of
dolls. They had b!g wooden shoes that
kept turning to look at each other, an.i
their green coat-tails were long: and
Happy. They looked as if they had just
thumped in from the
Thfrewere daisy dolls dressed in green
and {lowering out In white- petals about
their faces. There were Brownies, too â
lrnp!5b>looklrte ftllows, -with round,
naughty eyes and impudent beckoning
peaks nodding upon their caps.
Sor&e' dancing dolls were on exhibition,
besides. Not raj? dolls, -these: French dolls
they -were,, ofrbiscjue instead of cloth.
"Lorine and Jewell Allen were these dol's.
and they danced the minuet as it was
danced in the dignified old days. Just to
shov.' that they were really up to date
dolls in spite of knowing the minuet, they
wound up with a fin dp s!ccle Cakewalk. -
It is a simple matter to make human
rag dolls if you know the trick. It is
wonderful how a painted cloth face take?
away the human look from the rosiest
boy or girl that ever- romped. Cloth mit
tens h.'Oe the fingers, and there you are.
But after thp costume is on, it's harder
than you would thinK to play you arc

sarcastic, 'cept that he means ter go
along with us, which you can't do, Jim."
Jim rose calmly to his feet and stood
at attention. â¢
"Ain't willing to be left out of the
game," said Dankes. smiling and pointing
to the dog, who glanced up at him for a
moment, but" only to continue his vagaries
all the more vigorously.;
"Making his toilet, too, by Jove," said
Ned. "Having'fun with us, oh?"
Jim was discovered washing up as if he
were a cat, rubbing his snout and ears
with his paws, and rolling himself over
and over upon a piece of sacking near the
bench. ' <
'"Thank you, Dankes; you have a dis
criminating eye," said Ned. "I feel quite
rakish; Where's Jim?".
â¢ "Guess you're in high sperrits,'? said
Dankes; "and you look kinder festive, too
âsomething between a dood and a Euro
pean swell."
"Think I favor<Ellsha, then? Want to
mock me and have me call up the bars?"
said Dankes, with a quiet smile.
"I say I think you are a picture; braided

black trousers, tmtanned boots that Oliver
Cromwell might have worn, a hat worthy
of a dandy cowbody.a pair of eyes that
might belong to a youngster of 20, and a
beard soft enough to make a cushion for a
fine lady's boudoir." said Ned, punctuat
ing the points of his criticism with a
laugh.
"I feel devilish low, pard. Come on;
let's have the prescription; let it be nau
seous with quinine, and make it strong."
Dankes handed him the llerce decoction.
"By Jupiter! but it's a bitter dose," Ned
exclaimed, coughing and making a wry
face at the draught. "It demands a fresh
drink to wash it down, don't you think
so?"
"If that's how It strikes you," said
Dankes, "why, certainly. Eh, Jim?"
Jim snorted a kind ot. half-and-half ap
proval, â¢ and Dankes passed the bottle.
Ned helped himself, and smacked his lips
and said it was worth while not to drink
for a term to revive a man's liveliest
memories with such a refresher. At the
same time he deliberately corked the bot
tle after his second giass, and requested
Dankes to put it awayl and Old Prudent
promptly replaced it ini the cupboard.
Presently, the two men washed and
dressed for the evening's entertainment.
They made their toilettes outside the
cabin. A lad came up from the valley
night and morning to see after things a
bit. sweep, up, and keep the place tidy.
He tilled the tubs and basins on the bench
outside the cabin, where the two men
washed themselves and rubbed 'down. Ned
had a tiny mirror in his room, and what
Dankes called "a 'setjout of fancy goods"
in the way of combs and brushes. He
shaved.' but Solomon rejoiced in a beard
worthy of' the prophets, as the v were de
pleted In 'an old Bible that was his soli
tary volume of serious literature.
"Why. pard," raid Ned, "you are a pic
ture! Remind me of a splendid looking
fellow who was a model for artists; used
to haunt the Strand in London a good
deal; was a merchant in a small way;
went about without his hat: had none of
.your manly character, Dankes, but was
patriarchal, you know. 'Hello,' paid a
friend of mine, meeting him in the street
for the first time, 'what are you doing out
of the Old Testament? 1 "
.'â¢y/r.u are a cup too low; that's what's
the matter. It's a chill, with fever. Your
eyes are red, your hand's shaky, your
spirits down in your boots. Take my pre
scription, and, if you're not up to it at
sundown, why, you shall cry off the Drift,
and lie up. like a feather-bed warrior.
What do you say?"
"That's so," said Ned; "but morp than
ever to-night I don't want to break the
truce we seem to have mutually set up.
Under similar conditions six months ago'
I would have had no truce 'with such a
rufllan; I would have taken him by tho
throat; but six months ago I had not seea
the woman who is to be my wife; and 1
have a sneaking desire to go back to Chi
cago â¢with a whole skin. I can't help
thinking there is an undercurrent of ani
mosity against ine at Mind- Man's Drilt.
Having regard; to : his relationship with
Dexter, it might not answer Digges' pur
pose to wreak upon me a cowardly venge
ance in which he was the chief actor.
You heard me talking '< in my sleep, you
say. I had bad dreams, Solomon. I seem
to be running into danger. I am no cow
ard, pard. But I fear 1 lack the discretion
that makes courage successful."
"Why, yes. You ain't afraid of that
coyote now. He's been more than civil
of late. Mister Dexter must have re
strained him, and, brute though he" be,
Digges has both eyes -on his pocket. He
can't afford to fall out with Dexter. Dex
ter's puttin' up twenty thousand dollars
for a new mill. Digges Is beholden to
Dexter. You are Dexter'* represent
ative."
"I guess you are v.nder the weather,"
said Solomon Do.nkes to Ned; "your hand
shakes, I heard you talkin' in your sleep;
it's a touch of fever. Take my tip, parl;
a go of Old Rye, with a dash of quinine."
"I think not," said Ned. "I might not
stop at one go."
"Do you tell me that; if the doctor pre
scribes a potion you'll want to take his
stutf in double doses?"
"I suppose we must go to the Drift to
night?" Ned evasively replied.
The ofcasion was a night at Blind Man's
Drift, when the striking of the great
Drift lead Â¦was celebrated. So far the an
nual festival was quite new. Blind Man's
Drift was only three years old. The
"boys" of Platt's Valley and the Ridge
were invited to supper, at the expense of
the Drift.
Platts Vallev and the Ridge were only
a year or two older than Blind Man's
Drift. They each celebrated their first
stroke of good fortune, but the Drift was
the most munificent of the three, and of
late with' some reason, for Abner Digges
and his partners had "struck.it rich"
within the previous three months, and the
boys, collectively and individually, had
staked out new and important claims.
Old Prudent might have prevented it, if
he had not bean an instrument in the
hands of Fate. The day came when he
encouraged Glover to fortify himself with
a stimulant, that, used wisely, may be all
men desire to believe it; but, taken with
out restraint, Htj. a cruel enemy, and was
destined to be Glover's undoing. Not for
the world would Solomon Dankes have
handed Ned the bottle, could be have
foreseen the consequences. He was fond
of Ned, and Ned believed himself to be
most fprtunate in Solomon's friendship.

omon.- " "Tain't often he lets on tfiat

It was as if Old Prudent had Interpreted

his possible death; and there was soino
thing uncanny, in the subdued howl that
Solomon's dog set up as Ned drew his

. "I once knew a feller," said OM Pru
dent, "it was down South, where they
mostly fought with knives; he knew naw
thln' 'bout the trick of it. but the mo
ment the signal was given just leaped
upon his man like a tiger; no sparrln', no
flourish of tactics, no manooverin', nor
any fencing movement whatever.' but just
a shout and a spring, and the game was
up, his man was sped, almost without a
groan. It's one thing or the other; know
a lot or- nawthin'. Ignorance is some
times as well equipped as skill, especially
when there's luck thrown in."
But Dlggs had slipped away from the
scene soon after Ned Â«andÂ» Dankes; slip
ped away, and thrust, his head Into a
bucket 'of water, and mopped : his face,
and shut the door, and got under his
blanket; for, though he loved whisky and
fun, and poker, and all the. delights of
a great Drift night, he knew the.impor
tance of a steady hand and a cool, head,
when there was the serious business of a
duel to the death. . on the -morrow. A
"That's right. Now, you can vamouch;
hero's a dollar. Come early in the morn
in'."
"Yes, guv'nor,'.' said Dave: and his lan
tern- could be eeen a few minutes later
dancing down in the valley toward the
flaming lights of the Drift, that now fair
ly mocked the stars with yellow lampj
and red,,with candles, and with naphtha,
making quite a halo for itself on tha
hillside. You might have hearfl the hum
of it and the din a mile off, early into the
morning. â¢
The, lad from the valley was waiting
for their return. There was a good fire
in the stove, the two lamps were lighted,
and the boy had. been reading In theold
Bible. .
"Well, Dave, my lad, have you had
somethin 1 to eat?" .
"Yes, guv'nor," said Dave. "I helped
m'self, as you said I was ter."
"That's right," said Glover: "tha'd
righ'," gradually losing the free use of
his legs as well as his tongue. .
"Jim knowsâ Jim- knows: don't you
Jim? Where have I heard that before?
Jim knows!- I'm getting a bit confused,
eh, Dankes?"
"Oh, no, dear friend," Dankes replied.
"You're a real, good sort, Old Prudent.
You'd stand by: a fellow to the death,."
â¢ "I hope so," said Dankes. "Anyhow,
I'll stand by you, Ned."
The. dog, that had come bounding to
meet them on the threshold, barked, with
welcome yaps and gurgles.
"Devilish good time you prescribed for
me, Old Prudent. Yes, it was! You
bucked me up. Yes, you did, Old Pru
dent. What the devil did I care for the
brute and all his dirty pals? I'd
have fought the lot of them! What did
he call me? A cur? Me? Ned Glover?
A cur! Ah, ah! It makes he laugh. Why,
God bless my soul, I'm Just the opposite.
Ain't I, Jim?"
It went to Old Prudent's heart to hear
Ned laugh, knowing the ordeal he would
have to undergo on the morrow. Other-
Wise he would have been tempted to laugh
with him.
"You mean, with the sweet and innocent
Abner.- Ah, ah! I pitched him head over
heels. What a fool he looked! 'Pon my
soul, I think I should. have laughed even
If he had knifed me!"
"A queer lot of devils," he said. "They
remind me of an election row I saw In
Ireland. It was in tho South, and, by
Jove! it wasn't a much more civilized vil
lage than the Drift!"
"You were not what you call discreet,
Ned." said Dankes. .
As they plodded along the valley, with
their lanterns, and at last -mounted tho
hillside of Prudent's Gulch. Ned laughed
and chatted as if he had entirely forgot
ten the assault of Abner Digges.
Ned and Dankes managed to get to
gether and sat out a hand or two of poker,
losing their money with a good grace;
Glover merry, in spite of the dangerous
Incident of the festival: Dankes thought
ful, and looking for the first opportunity
to withdraw. It came comparatively
early.
Some pulled out pipes, a few smoked
cigars; some sat down and talked togeth
er; some made up card parties; some got
drunk, though most of them found it dif
ficult to compliment the strength of the li
quor to that extent.
"A truce," then said another, "and let
the fun go on. No more chestnuts. Let
the Chicago game and the bender be
taken up to-morrow. To-night, pass the
bottle and cast the dice, or let it be eu
chre or poker, or what the hell you like
best â but no fightin*. Come on, you Brit
isher. We'll see fair play, and to > hell
with him that's agen it! Here's to you!"
Ned filled his glass, in response to the
friendly challenge. Several other men
stood In. "Here we go!" they said, reach
ing out to touch his glass. "Here, we go!"
said Ned, and each man swallowed hid
quantity.
"The first as stirs agen that rule's a
dead 'un!" said a stony, hard-featured
fellow, in a red shirt and fustian breeches,
belted with a thick tanned strap that car
ried a knife. He dominated the crowa,
though his was not che only pistol held
ready for action.
Hisses and groans and other demon
strations of apger punctuated almost every
word of this declaration; and in the midst
of it both Glover and Dankes rose to their
feet at the same moment.
"Boys!" shouted Dankes, "this ain't
worthy of the Drift!"
"Men!" said Ned, waving Dankes down,
"your boss is a liar and a coward!"
The daring declaration was received
with dead silence.
"He drew his knife upon a woman.
Would any of you have stood by, without
raising a hand to defend her?"
"No!" thundered twenty voices. "No,
by Gawd!" â¢.
"Hear me, boys!" roared Digges leaving
his seat and approaching Glover. "Would
you have stood on the stand In court and
witnessed in cold blood 'gainst a feller
who'd ben on abender, the first time he'd
tried ter paint a street red for two year?"
â¢'No. no!" they shouted.
Meanwhile Dankes and his immediate
neighbors were having a wrangle on their
own account, and several men left their
seats.
"You are a Gawd-blamed cur!" hissed
DlRges, rushing upon Glover, who caught
his raised arm and hurled him back
among the glasses and supper things,
makjng a terrible racket.
A dozen men Intervened at once. Danked
foremost. Â¦ .
"No ilghtin* to-nightj" shouted several
voices at once. "No bloodshed when we
celebrate the great lead of Blind Man's
Drift!"
"Yes, by thunder! And I'd ha ben In
the Chicago House of Correction now ef
It hadn't ben for my friend, the Honor
able Hiram Dexter!"
v.n appreciative eye. â¢ Streams of light
came out from doors and windows and
unglazed loopholes, affording glimpses of
the men. who. were partaking of . more or
less primitive refreshments; cold salt
beef, tinned tongues, cheese, biscuits,
chunks of: bacon, pickles and other com
estibles of. easy importation, with whisky
galore. '.
. Old Prudent and Glover joined the main
body of feasters In the saloon of the sin
gle barroom, that was run by a committee
for the general good of the camp; one of
the members taking It In turn to act the
part of barman and caterer, to the extent
of the free lunch that obtains in a general
way throughout the bar life of the United
States. . .
After .supper, which ended at various
times, according to the arrangements of
enjen table and the appetites of the feast
ers, "The Prosperity of the Drift" was
drunk, 'and here and there a song was
trolled out in a lugubrious bass, relieved
by a wild chorus. But In most of the
shanties cards were produced and poker
and- euchre reigned supreme, twin raon
archs of the orgy that ran through the
night.
Abner Digges' bossed the chief show,
where Glover and Dankes were the chief
guests. Ned sat apart from Dankes. The
whisky was passed around in a steady cir
cle, every man taking his whack; some
wjth water, but mostly without.
Nedâ either from lnclination,-or not lik
ing to appear unsocial or conspicuous in
his moderation-acted up to the habit of
the timej and soon became just as talk
ative as his neighbors. Dankes watched
Mm with much solicitude; but, after a
time, was content, feeling that Ned had
secured the good will of the company by
his liigh spirits and capital ttories. . .
Dam me. mates," said Abner Dlgges.
, a suddenness and impetuosity that
startled the table, the more so as it con
trasted with his previous silence, "he'll
take me. I've a story I'm sot on tellin'.
It was a blarsted Britisherâ Just such as
him who s ben so free with his- chestnuts
âthat got me by the. leg in Chicago By
thunder, it was! I was on a mild kind
of a bender, after two years of the Drift.
And it was him as had me laggedâ by
,'lt was!"
A shout of angry protest and indigna
tion arose against Ned, as Digges pointed
his thick finger at him.
' "That's all right. You shall nave that
collar., I only love you now, Jim; then
I'll envy yon." . . Â¦
At sunset they sallied forth, each with
his lantern. They iound-the boys assem
bled not in a single tent or.- cabin but all
over the place; in the saloon, with its faro
table at the back: in the long shed, where
Bome twenty of them bunkedin berths ar

the tents and cabii.sor huts r a party of
revelers, so to speak, in every shelter. At
the back of all could bo heard the thump
ing of the mill that went day and night,
and the beat of . tho engine. In the day
time it was a sordid scene; camp and
mines, shafts and shoots disfiguring the
foothills of the mountains that were
broke/n into ridges, with pines and other
trees arid stricken foliage climbing up to
rocky peaks. At night ragged edges were
softened; and on this night in particular
the varied illuminations of the camp gave
to the scene a touch of artistic effect that

"Not particular wrong, and yet I can't

Jim slunk back into his corner.
"Put the things away. Dave; and you
needn't return till sundown."
"We'll be' thar," said Dankes.
Jim crawled across the room, as if he
meant mischief; but he only snarled and
showed his teeth.
"We thank you, Mr. Dankes, for the
'orspitallty of Prudent's Gulch, and beg
to declare this court adjourned, to Blind
Man's Drift, at eight of the clock."
"Adjourned accordin'," said Kerridge,
sheepishly.

other members of the deputation.
As they filed out Jaggers paused, to say.
"We'll expect you. Mister Dankes. you

"One more," was the general reply.
Dave filled the glasses again: the watch

rose from their seats.
"What d'ye say, pards?" asked Jaggers,

To which vague sentiment they all
tctsed off their liquor, only one other,
besides Dankes, taking the fellow of
water.
"Another?" said Dankea., â¢
"Dave, give the gentlemen the whisky:
you'll find plenty of glasses in the cup

Dave handed round the liquor, and
Dankes bade the men be seated.

gives your gullet a torchlight procession
and makes you see fireworks, and them
as have enjoyed that experience calls 1:

"Dave! Eave!" called Dankes, going
to the'door.
"Here I am," said Dave, hurrying up,
with Jim at his heels. *
Jim looked at h!s master's visitors in

and expressing his opinion cf them

Kerridge, hitching . up . his trousers and

game. I kin get you a pony from tho
valley. You kin get to the Forks fust,
even if Digges attempted to follow you,
which he wouldn't." ...
"I won't run. parti. I'll fight himt
"Do you mean It? Solid?"
"Kin you shoctr
"Yes "
"Ever killed your man?
"So, thank God!'"
"Ever befn out with an enemy.
â¢Tn a duol? No."
"But you'd feel safer with a pistol than
a klfer'
"Yes."
"Here's my knife. I've shown you what
they call the upper cut." said Dankes,
handing him the weapon; "I gave you a
notion of the handling. "
"Yes." said Ned. fingering the weapon
and making several of the pa^es ana
guards that Dankes had endeavored to
teach him.
Old Prudent feared from the first
that Dtgges might lure his partner into a
quarrel, with its ultimate encounter.
"I shall mnko a proposition to the com
mittee." said Dankes.
"What sort.'" >.
"To give you the- choice of -weapons.
He's got a trick of seemln' to play with
a man and he'll try to show oft with you.
Pistol or Â¦knife, be clear of your Intention;
and go for him straight. .That 13. dear
friend ef you air .resolved to meet him.
Dave's outside. Ha'll fetch that pony In
twenty minutes."
"If I could go with clean hands, old
man; if I couM feel I had not debased
myself; If I did not feel at this moment,
that I must drain yonder bottle, I think
I would go. Give me a drink, Dankes;
it'll steady my hand."
Dankes filled half a tumbler of whisky,
â¢with water to follow.
"That's the thing, old man. said Ned
when he had emptied the glass: "puts
new life Into a fellow, stiffens him up.
Dankes, old man, I'm a good sort of a
duffer.- The ball at my feet. I kirk It
aside focjothcrs to play at Fortune with.
If I hadn't been drunk last night-my
God! think of it. drunk!â I'd have choked
that brute to death, and the world would
have been quit of a monster: but I let
him slip through my drunken fingers.
And now I feel as if I was at his mercy."
"By thunder. Ned. you mustn't feel any
thing of the sort! Stretch out your arms,
pull yourself together. It cannot be that
God in heaven shall permit him, to hurt
you!"
"Dear old man: If I were only worthy
of heaven's guardianship I should go Into
the fight with the faith of a David against
a Goliath. And yet," he went on. now
with a tone of drop pathos in his voice.
"God might, perhaps, help me for her
sake. She would grieve so If anything
happened to me; and she loves me so well;
nothing I did would make me altogether
unworthy in her sight."
"Stride out, pard; they kin tee us." said
Dankes.
>?ed shook himself and swung, alons
with his old defiant gait: and presently
they met Digges and the committee.
* CHAPTER XXV.
A DUEL TO THE DEATH.
Rarely has Blind Man's Drift seen a
lovller day. Not that BUr.rt Man's Drift
appreciated It. To Blind Man's Drift u
day was hot or cold or wet. or dry. It tt&s
never lovely, In an esthetic sense. Winter
was approaching spring. There was no
sign of leaf or flower; but the air. if one
may use such a simile, had a lilt In it.
Some would liken the effect of It to the
exhlleratlon of champagne. Mountains
that were miles and miles away appeared
to have come close into the valley. Dis
tant peaks, with caps of snow, sparkled
in- the sun. The stream that supplied.
Blind Man's Drift with water came bound-
Ing Into Its channel with a laugh and a
song. Birds were twittering, and the sun
made sordid banks of dirt, ugly scaf
foldings, shafts and timbers of the mine,
and the rickety roofs of ill built houses
and the ragged canvas oi tents almost
picturesque.
They were a motley company of men
who awaited the coming of Dankes and
Glover. Many of them bore -the ejects
of the previous night's debauch in blood
shot eyes and unshaven chins. Most of
them wore their beards. Not one of them
but on this occasion looked unkempt.
Some In neavy jackets with abnormal
pockets, some In shirts and baggy trousers
tucked Into great boots, all ot them wita
slouch hats of varying sizes, and each
with his belt and knife, not to mention
bu'ges in back trousers pockets, where
they carried what they called their
"guns." being weapons known to ultra
civilized society as pistols, revolvers or
slx-shcoters.
The committee were assembled In the
ragged space fronting the saloon, from
the rough painted wings of which tho
camp spread, among the sand and boul
ders and half-burned trunks of trees, the
foreground of the mining operations of
the drift.
Pete Kerrldge and Rorty Jaggers were
the principal speakers. Captain Dan. a
loose-limbed, blue-eyed giant, with hair
that a stage blonde of the old country
might have envied, took an occasional
hand In the talk. Nobody knew what Dan
had captained, either on sea or land, or
where he came from; but he had been
styled "captain" from the first, and oneÂ©
in a way he would assert the authority of
a leader.
"Gentlemen," eald Old Prudent. In hi*
most courtly manner. "I'll be short with
you and to the purpose."
He seemed to look over the head3 cf
Jaggers and Pete Kerrldge and address
himself to Captain Dan.
"I claim for my pard the privilege cf
his country, the custom of Europe. The
man that offers affront to another don't
have the choice of wepplns."
Digges, who stood apart, leaning against
the door-post of the saloon, shrugged ntÂ«
shoulders and Kerridjje snoTted In a
scornful way. He felt safer to do so la
.the main thoroughfare of the drift tfiaa
at Prudent's Gulch.
"I guess, sah," said tho captain, with a
Southern drawl, "the drift has made a
law unto Itself: but we're a generous
crowd, yes. sah."
Ned. Glover, taking an outside place,
calmly regarding the company. A certain
Instinct that moves the journalist set him
ticking off their pointsâ tho cowboy-like
hats, high boot?, shirts showing brown,
necks wrapped in loose colored necker
chiefs: one man a veritable Garibaldian
In appearance, another solid as an Eng
lish navy; a third with drooping mus
tache and long hair, and bronzed at some
time or other with a Southern sun. They
were discussing points in the chances of
Ned's death, and he was so indifferent or
po resigned that he made close observa
tion of the color of their eyes, the cut of
their Jackets or the material in their belts.
"It ain't for us, parda. to make a new
law to fit this yere stranger, who's
brought discord among us." said Jaggers*.
"I move that we puts it to the boss, who
Is most Interested."
"It ain't a bad notion. Mlstah Jagger3.
I vote for it with a provision. Let Mistah
Dankes and Mlstah Jaggers. who, I un
derstand, will attend Boss Disges. toss up
a coin and give fate a chance."
"I'll speak to that, parda." said Ker
ridge. edging well away from Dankes.
"we don't want no foolln around on this
thing. Rules Is rules, andâ r-"
"Fools 13 fools." said Dankes. unable,
with all his coolness, to keep np with
K "That e s so " ?ald Captain Dan, with a
rich chuckle! "and I guess there ain't no
greatah specimen than our friend Ker
rf Â»To"order. gentlemen, to order." said
one of the usually silent men of the Drift
-I apologize for inter ruptin'." said
D "i^ok here." said Digges. stepping for

"Anyway, gentlemen; Solomon Dankea

"Vote on It!" rejoined Jasgers. "WTjos
for sudden death?"

"The rivrr pive? twice that gives quick,

laying aside "her knitting and receiving
with ojvM arms the delegated kiss and

the rl< best and one of the safest men in
the valley; its peacemaker, its life and
soul when any good work is afoot, not
that many good works are afoot. Some
day, and that not so long first, when
there are women in the camps, the
civilization of the valley, the Ridge and
BliTid Man's Drlft'fv.ill begin. Onee or
twice a week we go to Blind Man's Drift,
to meet the boys sind have a drink, or a
game at euchre or poker, or to a sing-

kind of diversion, and It would be always
if men could drink wisely and not too
much."

scratched out, the truth being that Ked

deemed it best not at that time to men
tion. On his last visit he had met face
la face his sworn and deadly enemy, Ab
ner Dirges. Dipge* had been away from
the cainp for some time, and hid only
ifMurr.eJ thai very day. "I hear*d as you
v.as here," Dirges had said to him; "Mis
ter Dexter said 1 was to name him as
our mu-tu-al friend.'' Glover had rcrlied:
"Indeod, and I hoj c ~e are no longer ene
mies." "Thut's as may be," Dlgrgcs had
answered; "but rton'i arsk me (o drink
just yet.*. It was a quick inspiration on
Glover's pan, for the sake of peace and
his own safety: to try and maintain a
iruce between them. But Old Prudent,
ov<>rlicar>i\;r the brief t<rms of the recog
nition, said to Ned, on their way to the
Gulch that night, "Guess you'll do well
to beware oi Digges"; and. when over
their wood tire (ilover had told Solomon
the story of their quarrel. Old Prudent
said. "Have your gun ready and don't
hesitate to use it. If ever you have
worOs with 1:1m. and he either fingers for
him have it straight. But best ket>p away
from Blin.l Man 1 ? Drift of nights."
Of course. Ned was not going to tell
Zella anything of this, though, somehow
the r.amo cf Digges had crept into the end
of his pen. and it wa* there he had blotted
the paper and soratchr-d out a few words.
"There's a Wot and something obliter
ated, perhaps ho was thinking of his
'Mail' article." she said, "and had got '
some of it in the letter."
And then rhe read on.
;!When I have sealed thl?. my dear, to
you I am going in write a long letter to

â !n rase you might want to write lo
him."
"Whyâ 5n case I might want to write to
him, Bridget?" sai.l Zella, turning to liPr

her attention was centered on "the apple
of her eye," and "hivvin's angel on

and emlcarmcnt that she applied to her

"Faith, he thinks ye might want his
cl.ar-ac-ter: or. maybe, to invite him to

"It wouldn't bo my place to\lnvlte him
tr> tl-.o Wf-fiiling.'" ga'd Zella.: "and I have
had his ehar-ae-ter from his own I'.ps."
"And he had your consint from your
own,*' said Bridget with a smile.
â¢ "And I didn't kiss him a whit more fer
vently -than you did vourself, vou Insinu
ating old flirt 1 ."
"Well, go on wid the lrtther; and don't
be askin' so many questions."
"Dick Lorrimer." continued Zella. read
ing, "after yourself, and next to Bridget
O'Hagan. is my best friend."
"Tiie dear teller; to name me after yer
filf! Saint Mary watch over him, and hlv
vin be hi? reward!"
"If ever you should want a friend, an!
it happened I was not nigh. Dick Lorrimer
will be your providence. One never knows
v.hen one may wnnt a friend. For In
stance, if you were not by and I wanted
a friend this side the Atlantic, Bridget
O'Hagan would stand to me, in my esti
mation, what Dick Lorrimer would to
you." t
Zella's eyes drooped, and the tone of her
voice lost something of Its jovous -music,
us she read these lines, that seemed forced
and out of harmony with the rest of the
letter.
"Do you understand vhat he means.
Bridget?"
"Oh: he manes that we should kape in
our mcinds who aro our frinds. me dar
l!nt. whin there's miles and miles between
us."
"You will realize all I mean about Dick
when you meet him on his native heath."
the letter continued. "Such a self-denying,
Innocent, kindly, unsophisticated, wise, in
telligent, learned, intellectual oddity, you
can't Imagine."
"And now, sweetheart, I must say au
revoir. Old Prudent and his dog little
drc-im I am going to write another letter
before I turn In. Every time I pause, the
dog â 'Jim,' he calls him â looks up and
wags his tail, and Old Prudent nods ap
provingly. I mu.st give them ton minutes
between the acts; and at tho close haul
up my chair (made out of an old flour
barrel, with a roft skin in the seat: you'd
be surprised what a fine arm chair you
can make out of a Jlour barrel!) to the
fctove. and have a parting pip?.
"This, my own dear love, by way of
conclusion; you are never to doubt my
devotion: you are always to feel that I
look upon myself as tho happiest of hap-,
py men in being assured that you love mo
in return: that I prize your love beyond
everything a mortal could possess; that I
shall rever willfully give you cause for
a moment's regret that we ever met; that
I love you with all my heart and soul;
that I count the minutes that separate us;
that I shall return to Parkslde the instant
the smallest opportunity offersâ such, 'for
example, as a reasonable excuse of busi
ness that may enable me to go to Chi
cago in connection with Dexter's or my
own affairs, even if I had to return the
next day; and that, anyhow, I shall not
be away three or four months altogether,
whether matters are sufficiently settled or
not for the onÂ» blissful vacation of my
life, when a certain happy couple will
start on tnr-ir honeymoon tour, from
Parkside for Uurope! God have you in
his keeping, sweetheart, is the constant
prayer of â Your loving and devoted â
Ned."
Zella dropped her hands into her lap.
with the. letter, and remained a long time
slient.
Bridget noticed that the closing pass
ages of the letter had moved her greatly.
Presently, laying aside her knitting, she
busied herself .about household matters,
until she felt that Zelia's eyes were foi
lowlng her.
"It's natural," she said, "that the last
av a letter has a touch av sorrcr In it,
Fame as partin* has. Ivlry leter has a
kind av 'Good-bye' In the tail av it. wid a
prayer and a 'God save Olreland,' and all
the rist av what they call affection's to
kens. 'Absince makes the heart grow
fonder* or:d 'Forsit-me-not.' as if the
writer did not know we'd' nivver forgit.
But it's y.?\ the way av letters; and love
letters most av ail."
It was only for the sake of talking that
Bridget went on saying these common
place thing?, until Zella should have re
covered her good spirits.
"From tho point where he made the blot
and scratchod a word or two out it is
a different letter." said Zella, as if speak
ing only to herself; "as if a shadow had
suddenly fallen upon his dearest hopes;
it's the letter of a different man, doesn't
run along as at first, buovantly, though
tenderly, from tho point of view that we
are separated by many days of travel; it
seems forced, like the letter ofvone who
Is trying to say nice thing:?, and' finds It
hard, as if he kont something backâ"
"If ye wasn't so learned ye'd nivver
think so." paid Bridget. "It comes av be
in" a critic av motives, and phwat MIsther
Glover called 'style.' whin* he was readln*
Misther Immerscn's buke to ye the night
av yer birthday; d'ye rimimbor?"
"Yes. drar heart, I remember," said
Zella; "and how wo all sat down together,
after every other body In the house was
abed and talked nnd talked until the clock
struck midnight."
"And how the dear feller Insisted upon
mo Ftayin* wid ye, ajid tellln' ye tales of
Ould Olreland: though not one in a hun
dred thousand lovers would have been
throubled wid the idle possip av an ould
widder woman: which showed the swate
nr5Â« av hiÂ« disposition, tuned to 1 pelf-sac
rifice ana all that's kindly in human na
ture."
"You are a dear soul. Bridget! I love
him the more that he- found out at once."
"Zella. mo Oarlint:" was all that Brid
get could reply.
CHAPTER XXII. .
OMENS OF DISASTER.
"There," said Ned. having sealed the
foregoing letter and fully addressed It.
"You think we'll get this through to-mor
row?"
"I reckon so," said Old Prudent. "Me
and Jfm'll see to that.''
Jim wagged his stumpy tall and rubbed
his wet nose against Ned's legs, by way
of welcome to the stove..
"Old friends, you and Jim?"
"Guess so; I often think he's the oldest
of the two. though I had him when he
was n pup.''
"Believe he lived in some previous
state?" asked Ned In a dreamy, specula
tive mood.
"I think there's a deal of human nater
In animals."
"Especially in Jim."
'"Well, I guess Jim kin do everything
but talk: Fometimes when he and tne'a by
ourselves he even does that."
"Talks?"
"Talks," repeated Dankes. "Look at
him now; d'ye think he don't understand
what we're sayln* about him?"
Jim snorted, wagged bis. stumpy tall.
turned round three times and then lay
down at Olfl Prudent's feet.
"I know. I was reminded of something
Carlyle said when he was thinking with
Shakespeare, who was still a greater phil
osopher, and It was .something: like this:
'There's more In the universe than Is
dreamt of in your philosophy; a dog's in
stinct is the voice of nature not a babbkx,
has grown in silence by continual com
munion with facts. Our estimation of ani
mals is unjust. Their body resembles our.
body with its four limbs, its spinal mar
row, main organs in the head, and so
forth; why may they not have a kind of
soul if only a rude draught and imperfect
Imitation of, ours V I don't say these are
his exact words, you know; but I bel'eve
the most beautiful of them are verbatim,
as follows: It's a strange and almost sol
emn, pathetic Wilng to see an intelligence
imprisoned In that dumb, rude tornv
struggling to express itself out of that;
oven as we do out of our imprisonment;
and succeed very imperfectly." Â¦
"That soes, Mr. Glover. When we call
some men brutes I guess we insult such
intelligences and moralities as belong to
our Jim." / .
"Amen to that, dear Old Prudent!" ' said
,"Â¦ . rcllUin S his pipe, and remarking as
he did so: Â¦
''I'm going to smoke one pipe with you,
pld pard, and then I must write another
letter." ,
"You're dead set on writin'," replied Sol
omon; "but it comes second nature to you,
Just as whisky comes tome."
"Ah! there you do yourself an injustice.

"Not a bad example, says you? Then,
why not join me? Eh, Jim?"
Jim looked," as plainly as could be, "Why
not ? - â¢ â / â¢
"I guess It would stiffen you up; and you
need It. workln'.as you do. It's a differ
ent thing, mind you, sittin', slingin' ink in
a bu-reau, or such. Out here a man wants
buekin up."
".Don't tempt me, old man. I can't put
on the brake as you can. I make it up
with tobacco."
"I guess that's where you don't make it'
up, pard. Uaecy clogs the wheels, ef you
don t oil 'em. , Mcan-ter say you can't sit
down and drink a glass, without wantin'
ter swaller a bottle? "
"That's m e to the life," said Ned, laugh

Jim barked heartily.

Ned patted the dog. lisltfcd his pips.
stretched his legs toward the stove, and
laying his hand upon Solomon's shoulder
said :
"Dear old partner, when I really feel
that 1 may take a drink medicinally I will.
At present I need no alcoholic 'bucking
up. 1 "
"Hope you never may," said Solomon.
But forewarned's forearmed. Never keep
your eye off Digges. I had the chance to
kill him once; but I'm squeamish 'bout
'avin' a feller',* death on my conscience."
"You think his reception of me means
mischief?"
"That's my conclusion. Eh, Jim?"
Jim howled and turned about and
snapped at an imaginary foe.
"Think I ought to turn coward and clear
out?" *
"No: I'm selfish enough to go quite the
contrary. But never let him out of your
sight when you're at Blind Man's Drift.
If you quarrel with him be the first to
shoot; otherwise it'll degenerate into a
duel, and the regulation tight is with the
knife. It's the rule of Blind Man's Drift;
so's it moughten' be called murder; and
every man practices with the bowie."
Then Ned remembered that it was with
a knife that Digges had threatened Zella
and himself, one or both.
"A longer and a bettor than m!n<%?"
asked Ned, drawing his big clasp-knife.
"Longer and better; and net hampered
with a haft that don't grip. See here."
He lumbered over to a primitive cabi
net nailed against the wall and brought
cut e. long blade, with a simple handle,
sharp as a razor, thick at the base as a
primitive tile, worked off to a point that
tapered to a suggestion of great mallea
bility, though it seemed to be as stilt as
a butcher's steel. It was a deadly weapon,
fashioned as the original "bowie" was
fashioned frdro a carpenter's file.
Ned lifted it and balanced it in his!hand
with a certain amount of technical skill.
"You know a knife when you see /one"
said Solomon. * !
"Yes. There is a fellow of my acquaint
ance in London who is great on the sword
and dagger duel, a., the Italians practiced
it; but duelling with knives alone is new
to me. This is a fine bit of work."
"You bet! It handles familiar; nothin'
of top-heaviness in it; a knife you can
poipfi. could throw at a mark, or fence
with it equally deft., Digges has a similar

danger of making- the fourth?"
"Not rf you're wary." said Solomon;
"not ef you let daylight into him on the
first provocation. No waitin' for the duel;
pot him straight, on square provocation
.of course."
"He is on terms with Mr. Hiram Dexter
whom 1 represent; that should be as good
as a truce while I am here. He mentioned
Dexter to me, and Dexter had evidently
spoken of me In our mutual interests."
"That counts." said Solomon: "What do
you say, Jim?"
Jim was asleep, in the warmth of the
stove, and only responded with an uncon
scious snore.
"I guess I'll turn In. of you are goin' to

"Have another drink, light another pipe,

said Solomon; " but my experience of life

sat to his rough desk.

HIS GLORIOUS RECORD.
The Bad Boy Returns
to the Old Grocery.
(Copyright, 1900, by the Press Publishing Company, New Yorkâ All
rights reserved. Any infringements will be vigorously prosecuted.)
THE old groceryman was sitting in an armchair in the! same old grocery,
nursing a rheumatic leg and hoping that no customers would come in
and make it necessary for him to get up and wait on them. He had
grown so old and crippled that he felt that the time was rapidly ap
proaching when he would be compelled to seil out and retire from business,
but he had become so attached to the old barrels and boxes, the stale stuff in
the store, the odors of the cheese and the codfish, the decaying fruit and ker
osene, that he felt that he would die if he had to go away from the old place
and be compelled to ''breathe fresh air. New groceries, with all the mod
ern improvements had Keen established near him, but he held some of his old
trade, and though the flies registered on all his goods, and the mice got be
hind the barrels and gave the cat plenty of exercise, the old man felt that he
was being left behind in the race of life, and he sighed as the door opened,
and put his lame leg down and groaned, and got up to greet a well-dressed
young man, who looljed as though he might be a university student, a de
tective or a confidence man. and the old man was on his guard for either
species, for he had had experience with all three. The young man looked
about the grocery a/ though taking an inventory, and his big black eyes
twinkled, though he tried to look, solemn and business like. He took a hard,
dry prune out of a box and tried to bite it, put his hand to his iaw as though
he had broken a tooth, and said, looking the old man straight in the eve:
'"The same old prunes? I supposed you would have sold that box of
prunes in the last fifteen years. I guess you don't advertise." and he threw
the prune at the cat, that had been asleep on top of a sugar-barrel, but had
awakened and arched its back and yawned. '
"What's the matter with the prunes?" said the old man as he walk'ed
toward the young customer. "People who do not like my*pnines don't have
to buy them," and he put his glasses up on his forehead and looked as though
he had as soon fight as eat. , * '
â¢ "I am on the trail of an old pirate that kept a grocery on this corner fif
teen years ago," said the young man, as he put his hand in his pistol
pocket. "He was a youneer man than you, but he had a face that would
send him/to-tne penitentiary whether he was guilty or not. That old grocery
man did much to wreck families in this community when I lived here-
"There was malaria in every vegetable he sold, dyspepsia in his glucose
sugar, dropsy in his. adulterated flour and wrinkles in his dried apples, and
the cemetery is thickly populated with his old customers. What peniten
tiary did, they send him to?" and the young man turned his face away and
wiped his eyes as though bereaved.
"See here, young fellow," said the old man, as he reached for a two
pound weight on. the scales, and colored up and began to breathe hard, "I
have been here"â ''
"I don't doubt that for a moment.'^said the young tormentor/ "but I want
to find that enemy of the human race that madt my young' life a burden.

"So you reject me!" the young lawyer
said, rather bitterly. "I wonder If It
would do any good to appeal the case to

"There Is no appeal from my decision."
she replied. "I am what you call the court

young man on the leg as though t he loved him. 'â¢
"Oh, everywhere." said the young man, as he reached up and took down
the codfish and found his initials on the skin. "To Colorado. New Mexico,
Old Mexico, the Klondike, in the Cuban war, the annex in the Philippines,
to China, and everywhere. I am coming in here every few days and have a
talk with you, but now I must go to the bank. Good-by, you old terror,"
and the young man started to go. 'fx'S : -
"One question." said the old groceryman, as he looked anxious. "Is
your Pa still living?"
"No! He has gone into politics." and the long-lost Bad Boy made a skip
for the door and was gone. "while the old man leaned against the showcase,
took a long breath, and said:
"History repeats itself, by gosh!" GEORGE W. PECK.
and innocent as I am to-day, and what did that old catamaran do to him?
When that innocent lamb would "play tricks on him, as all innocent boys will,
,he drove him out of the place with boots among his coat-tail3, and chas
tised him with pieces of barrel-head and sent him away weeping. What do
you suppose has become of that boy now, poor little angel? Look at me,
you old reformed.highwavman. vou sandbagger, you gold brick swindler,
look at me again and see if vou can trace any resemblance to that cherub that
used to keep things moving around this place," and the young man gave the
old man a laugh that was iust like the laugh of the Bad Boy. only coarser,
and he showed the same old teeth, with a little more gold on them, and the
old man dropped the hatchet and the two-pound weight on the floor, grab
bed the young man by both shoulders, looked him in the eyes, felt for the
old wart on his left thumb, looked at the scar under his left eye where an ex
ploding pop bottle of the old days had cut him, and shouted as he danced
on his rheumatic leg and the tear3 came to his eyes, "Peck's Bad Boy, by
ginger," and he pulled the big fellow to his bosom and hugged him, and said:
"By gum, the whole store is your3. I haven't had any fun since your folks
moved away. Here, try some of this cheese," and he let go of his old friend
and stood off and looked at him. and they both danced a jig and were still
at it when an old ladv came in to buy a lamp chimney, and she looked as
though she thought the old man must have had something besides sweet
cider. As the old lady went out with the lamp chimney, looking over her
shoulder as though she was afraid the old man would try to dance with her,
the young man took off his hat to the lady and said:
"Don't be alarmed, ladv. \ beg of you. I am his keeper, and ho shall
not harm you, but if you see a policeman on the street send him here at
once, for this old lunatic is going to make trouble in this neighborhood."
"None of that, boy," said the old man, as he picked up the hatchet and
looked savage. "You nearly ruined my business fifteen years asÂ©, and I
have just built it up again." , "
Then the old groceryman and the young fellow sat down on the barrels,
as they used to, and over the old times* . r
"The worst trick you played on me," said the old man. tmflinjr as
though it pleased him, "was when you took a dead gray cat, pulled the ears
out long and hung it up in front of the store with the rabbits. Do yon know
it has taken me fourteeg years to square myself with the minister who bought
that cat. He has just>begun to have confidence in me again, and now he
struck an oratorical attitude and continued: "Oh^ that cruel man. There
was' a beautiful little boy in this neighborhood, fifteen years ajro. pure
sturgeon? He must have sold vou this stock of goods when he was sent

fifteen years apo. and the skin has crown around the letters as the bark of
a tree does when you engrave your, girl's name on it. The villain I speak
of"
"Say, boy. I can't stand this any longer." said the old man as he came
arounÂ«l the counter with the two-pound weight in one hand and a hatchet in
the other. "I am the man"
''Yes, I know it, and you ought to have killed him before you let him
saw off on to you all the stale stuff that no white family would be found

As -yet there are not many of the class
who can boast of being experts with the

they have rivals .hot on their heels.".

passing of the
Chaperon
The older generation of English people
is looking on In dismay and with some
thing like alarm at the disappearance of
the chaperon, 'and the year 1900 will go
down in' history as the* date of her formal
.abolition. For the first time In the annals
of English society, at the few dances per
mitted by Ajie anxieties of the Boer war,
the girls, appeared unchaperoned. Lady
Jeune, commenting In the Fortnightly
Review upon the fact, says It was prob
ably due to tho disinclination of the older
women, whose sons and husbands were in
hourly peril, for such festivities, combined
with their reluctance to deprive their
daughters of all amusement at a time po
depressing. She adds:
"The Rosebud ball of America, which
was Inaugurated here, has long been the.
fashion on the other side of the Atlantic,'
where we have watched the system of
complete Independence among young peo
ple In full swing: The result there Is per
fectly satisfactory, but this has been the
.first test of it In this country, where hith
erto all tradition and experience has been
in opposition to It. One can only say from
personal experience and observation,
necessarily limited, belonging as, one does
to the ostracized' class of chaperons, that
there - % was nothing .different . to -the ' old"
days except that the -rooms looked bare
and lacked the background . of color and
brilliancy, whlch-undoubtedly a crowd of

emancipation of -Klrls. - With our modern
system Of 'education and training it seems
almost impossible to continue the control
of former years, and 'the danger, if there
Is any, Is surely mitigated by the Im
proved relations between parents and
children. The real friendship and confi
dence that now exist are the best safe
guard against any evil that may conceiv
ably arise." . ,

ways by which you may know when a
pillow is coming.

New Way of
Cooking Onions
and Tripe.
THE late Thomas Murrey,' so long fa

the defenders of the onion. He said
that the generally expressed Ameri
can abhorrence for the vegetable was an
affectation an<i that many of the most
pronounced dissenters were often Been
reveling on sauces /airly reeking with tha
flavor of the odoriferous bulb and its
cousins. "A â¢ '
The young gr?en onions which are In the
market In the spring are now to be had
from the hothouses and are capable of
preparation in numerous appetizing ways.
They must 'first be carefully washed in
salt water, the roots and tops trimmed
and then the onions tied again In small
bunches. These must be put over the lira
in boiling salted water and cooked for ten
minutes. This time allowance Is for tho
very young ones; a lonjjer time must bÂ«
allowed in proportion. They are then,
drained and placed on dry toast with,

make a great mistake when they overlook
them.

the Imported one, but it haJ a sweetness
and delicacy that the larger nut lacks.
The walnut and the butternut are the
richest of the American nuts. The hick

Â«re worthy a place on the menu either in
their natural state or in some of the many
appetizing and attractive forms In which
nuts may be prepared.
Nut salad has become, popular In the
last few seasons. English walnut* are the
bent for this purpose. They are mixed
with equal portions of tart Into small bits
and covered with mayonnaise. Sometimes
the three Ingredients,' celery, nuts and
apples, are used. I'.-
J Chopped nuts a.Â« n filling for sandwiches
are delicious. They should be moistened
slightly 'with mayonnaise and may be
used with or without a lettuce leaf. Hazel
and hickory nuts and pecans are good
used In this way.
The Italian chestnut* make excellent
soup. They should be boiled until. tender'
and. pressed through a sieve to make a
puree. The addition , of a little whipped
cream Is recommended for this soup.
Nut biscuit may be made from almonds,
English walnut* or from a mixture ot
several kinds of nuts, put through a food
cutter and mixed with flour, baking pow
der, a bit of butter and milk Into a dough
that may be kneaded readily and rolled
out to be cut with a biscuit cutter;
A tart that Is recommended highly is
made from a cup of chopped filberts, with
five grated ladyttngers, the yolks of eight
eggs and one and a half cups of powdered
sugar, one and a half table-spoonfuls of
whisky and the grated rind of a lemon.
This tart is baked thirty-five minutes in a
moderate oven. This Is a rich concoction,
but has a delicious flavor.

TO FORETELL DURATION OF LIFE BY X-RAYS
SS It possible to foretell the duration of
a man's life?
In j spite of certain preposterous
numbcr of years that any person will live.
It has long been admitted, as one of the
first and Indisputable conditions of lon-
wns resircely able to breathe; he was as
thin as a skeleton, and very often h!Â»
Iwart caused to beat. Yet this extraonll-
claims put forward from time to time
by clairvoyants and other so-called seers,
scientists have always maintained that
this question can only be answered in the
negative and that we can hardly expect to
obtain more light on the subject than Is
furnished by Flourens, the statistician,
who after years of labor discovered that
the average duration of life in Europe" is
from thirty-six to forty years, that the
ordinary duration is sixty-nve years and
that the abnormal duration is 125
years.
Now, however, a German savant Insists
that barring accidents, the exact duration
of any person's life can be determined by
means of the X rays. This savant is Herr
Rlchter, who is well known by his experi
ments with these rays, and by his works
on radiography, and his novel method of
determining the duration of life Is fully
explained in a paper by. him, which was
read the other day at the Imperial Col
lege of Berlin.
Herr Rlchter simply claims that an ex
amination of the principal organs cf tho
body by means of X-rays will show the
So there Is profit In the business. .But
nobody need fancy that It Is an easily
won profit. TTou remember what I said
about catteries and orphan asylums.
A cat's life saved means at the least $13
saved. Here in San Francisco the young
est female kitten brings $10. Males sell
for 515. From these prices they range up
ward, according to age, pedigree and.
points.
I give medicine in capsules or with &

her neck, and presto! the pill Is down be
fore she has begun to struggle.
After all is said and done, there will bÂ«
occasional sicknesses.* Distemper and
pneumonia are the most to be dreaded.
Some claim that tho latter is necessarily
fatal, but my husband and I brought ono
cat through It. We took turns sitting up
nights for almost a week. The poor little
thing's chin had to be propped up on a
pillow, otherwise It could not draw
breath. It was the most grateful invalid
I ever saw;, its gratitude alone would
have paid for all the trouble we took.
Good food is only one essential to good
health. Cleanliness Is another. Once a
week the houses are thoroughly washed
out with "water and oil of tar and clean
straw Is put into the beds. The cats must
have occasional Waths themselves. They
den't like water, to be sure. They much
prefer a bath after their own fashion to
the most Improved Turkish, but they hava
to put up with a brief discomfort for the
sake of cleanliness. And if the shampoo
is given gently by one whom they know
they are not badly frightened, although
they may be a bit cross. Dog soap and
warm water makes the most satisfactory
bath*. Rinse out the fur, rub the cat with
hot towels, wrap her In a blanket and lay
her in the sun or by a fire. She is soon as
contented as any beauty after her mas
eage and dainty grooming.
Fleas are an enemy that must be fought
constantly, and the best efforts scarcely
keep them .away. Various powders may
be sprinkled 'through the fur. The stings
of the insects are not only disagreeable

The kennel business for the day begins
with S o'clock breakfast. This consists of
a big dish of mush and milk for each
member of my family. The cuta no more
think of eating from one dish' than would
your own family in the dinir.g-room. In
the apartments are feeding shelves,- one
for each cat, and the animals know their
own, and. never think i uf disturbing ! an
other's.
The older cats have such husky appe
tites that I add a little boiled liver or soup
to their breakfast. In this climate they
can eat more meat without resultant fits
than they can in a warmer place, but no
where should kittens be fed heartily.
â¢ The noon meal Is a simple lunch of milk.
I follow city custom and serve dinner lato
â5 o'clock is the dinner hourâ and the pets
never let me forget it. Their appetites
keep as perfect time as a Swiss watch.
Sharp at 5. a mewing is set up, and If I
am as much as a minute late I am greeted
by importunate cries and scratchlngs on
the doors. When they see me coming
they run to their shelves and await their
turrs.
ThÂ« dinner consists of two dishes. One
is raw round of beef cut fine. I give two
tablespoonfuls of this to each grown cat.
The other dish is a. cooked mixture of
meat, vegetables and rice, and two table
spoonfuls of this; too, is the rule. Mut
ton, beef, liver or. heart may be used.
Whatever the meat, I put it through the
chopping'machine.
To kittens* that have been weaned but
are not yet old enough to attempt "high
living" I often give rice that has been
boiled in meat juice.
Half an hour after dinner a dish of milk
that has, been brought tothe boiling point
serves as. a nightcap, and then the cats'
sleepy time arrives.
The bnce-a-week fish and rice dinner Is
regarded-' as a special treat, and still
greater an event is Sunday's dessert. This
is an old-fashioned English pudding made
by the following recipe:
Four' tablespoons raw rice, .i -
~-Four quarts milk. '.*.'
Sugar to taste.
Cook in a slow oven. four hours.
, It is a good enough Sunday pudding for
anybody.' I might as well confess that I
can't resist tasting It myself before I
serve It for pussies' dinner.
Bo sure to have fresh drinking .water
At present I have two mothers with
their litters in the nursery. Dark nests
are what they prefer, so I provide them.
Here the babies are born and reared until
six weeks old. when I wean them. The
litters sometimes contain as many. as five,
but they average fewer thau those of
common cats.
The Angora babies are funny little
chubby things* fuzzy and white with tails
wedge-shaped'. They are as noisy : and
hungry and happy as other kittens, not
being at all oppressed by the family tree
bequeathed to them, upon their entrance
Into this world.
My pair of Siamese cats have the other
Besides the back yard buildings I have
devoted two rooms In the basement of my
house to the cats. One of these is the
nursery, the other the home of my
Siamese cats, and both must be kept
warm.
All the cages are provided with shelves
and stands for cat gymnastics. The ani
mals climb and swing and Jump for their
daily sport, and they are very fond of
perching on the bars. Don't you know
how other cats always seek a fence rail
to sit upon? Angoras are not different
in their Instincts.
There Isn't one of all my family more
lively than Duchess, so Just now I am
keeping her and her husband in the run,

false. In fact, the indications, such as
they are, point to Great Britain refusing
to consider any amendment to what the
Foreign Office already believes to be a
g-enerous concession.
To quote a high authority: "We would
rot have abrogated the. Clayton-Bulwer
treaty for any other nation in the world.
Unless all the traditions of British for
eign policy are reversed. I fail to see how
we can afford to giveaway any more ad
vantages, even to America."
No official representation of Inquiries
has been made to the Foreign Office,
where it la pointed out It is im
possible to form any final Judg
ment until the Benate acta. That
v.-ar, cr even a Bcrious misunderstanding
could ever 'result from such a cause, re
ceives no official or public credence.

ZiOXDOy. Dec S â Tnough the trod**
between Holland end Portugal can scaxce
ly result in war. it is far more serious
bjtjO. interesting than generally regarded
here. Great Britain Is concerned In the
affair more deeply than appears on the
surface, for It Is learned that It Is due to
a British protest to Portugal that the
exequatur of Herr Pott, the Dutch Consul
j- Lorenzo Marques, was withdrawn, and
Â¦L? visit of the British fleet to Portuguese
waters is something more than a coinci
dence. Tho Lisbon press frankly declares
it was intended as a warning demonstra
tion to other nation* to keep their hands
eff Portugal.
The British officials also do not hesitate
to admit their Government's readiness to
back up the action which Portugal took
at Its request. Hence Holland can do lit
tle more than gracefully make the best
cf a bad job unless she receive* the sup
port of some of the great powers, which
ts a very remote contingency.
The Â¦withdrawal of the Netherlands Min
ister at Lisbon and the Portuguese Minis
ter ax The Hague, though officially belit
tled, Is the sequence of serious friction,
the details of which were known to the
British Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs, the iiaxquls of LÂ«ensdowne, some
weeks ago. The unusual action of send
ing- the whole British channel pquadron
to Lisbon is regarded by those who have
Inside Information as being one of the
boldest and most successful etrokes of ag
gressive diplomacy In recent history. With
Great Britain ehowlng such a strong hand
the absent Ministers are likely to return
â¢ their posts shortly and the Incident will
probably only produce an effective Illus
tration of the fact that an alliance exists
between Portugal and Great Britain. It
was effected when the question of landing
South African troops at Beira, Portuguese
South Africa, came up, and was an
nounced at the time In these dispatches.
In this connection it Is interesting to note
that the French press regards the whole
tffalr as a fresh menace to Franc*, and
that tne Spanish papers interpret it sim
ilarly as regards their own country.

CHICAGO. Dec7lâ Six hundred tele- 1
graph operators on the lines of the Atchi
son, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad struck
to-day In sympathy with the operators on
the Golf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railroad,
a branch of 'the Atchison system, who
went out late ) Thursday. The foregoing
statement is according to. the best infor
mation obtainable from the company's of
ficials to-nlght. ''Â¦^Â¦'4,.
The entire number of operators on the
system is 1200, of whom 900 are said to be
union men. Of the 900 members of the
union 300 It Is stated refused to * strike,
leaving the system with about one-half of
Its men at work.
The officials of the road declare that un
der no circumstances will they yield to the
strikers, and that none of them will ever
again work for the company in any capac
ity.
The operators on the main lines of the
Atcbison system - demanded some weeks
ago an increase In pay and some changes
in rules. The negotiations with the com
pany had reached an acute stage when
the company conceded the demands of the
men and the trouble was averted. The
new order of things diL not prevail on the
Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe, and the op
erators there demanded an Increase of
pay, amounting it is stated to approxi
mately $100 per annum for each man, and
alterations In the rules whereby men were
compelled to ect as telegraph operators
and station agents also. The demand was
refused and the men went out.- To-night
the men on the main system went out in
sympathy.
The strike at this end of the line did not
take effect until 4:30 this afternoon, and
to-night, despite the scarcity of operators,
all trains pulled out ior the West on
schedule time.
As eoon as the "company knew of the
trouble it was compelled to face word was
sent along (he lines to set the danger sig
nal at all switches, and ahead of all pas
senger trains a pilot was Bent out, the
crew looking after all switches and set
ting the proper signals for the trains be
hind. ;
It was announced to-night at the offices
of the company that trains would continue
to be run In this way. and that In
gtretcb.es of territory where there were
no operators the trains would be run on
schedule time, the engineer regulating his
speed by. the time card.
SERVICE BADLY CRIPPLED.
Fruit Shippers.
Strike Affects the Southern California
j LOS ANGELES, Dec. 8.â The strike of
SantaFe telegraphers in this city has had
no perceptible effect on the running of
trains, though reports. from points along
the line show that the train service is
badly, crippled. A' dispatch to the Herald
from â¢ San - Bernardino says that orders
have been received there to â¢ close the
shops, throwlngÂ»325 men out of work.
Fruit shippers are greatly concerned,
for' an average of 100 cars of fruit a day
have been forwarded from there over the
Santa Fe, and already the sidings are
crowded with cars. Many shippers are
sending by the Southern Pacific.
Santa Fe officials say that only five men
went out "in .this city and their places
were filled Immediately. The operators
claim that every union man , but one
obeyed the strike order. ' The telegraphers
met this afternoon and prepared a state
ment, saying In part: " ' 'Z Y ''.-â¢
"It is an absolute fact that many of the
telegraphers on the Gulf, C.olorado and
Santa Fe are frequently required to be on

allowed to call their own. They are sub

It Is also whispered that her Majesty

LONDON, Dec. 8.^The War Office has
received the following dispatch from Gen
eral Kitchener at Bloemfontein, dated De
cember 8:
"I have just received news from Knox
at Rouxville that Dewet's force, having
failed to force Coomassie bridge, which
we held, has trekked northeast, abandon
ing 500 hprses and many carts. His at
tempt on Cape Colony, therefore, has
failed. He is being pressed on all sides."
A special from Allwal North. Cape Col
ony, dated Friday, says General' Dewet '
appears to be In a most dangerous posi
tion and to need all his strategy to extri
cate his force. With strong British col
umns on three sides and two swollen riv
ers barring his front, the British com
manders begin to be hopeful that the
great chase by four columns, which has
boen one of the most exciting incidents of
the war, will result In the capture of De
wet. Definite news of his whereabouts
was first received December 2. The next
morning General Kno* started in hot pur
suit and PUcher's and Herbert's -columns
were' detached to mÂ£ke a turning.move
ment. After three hours* march. Gen
eral Knbx learned that during the night
Dewet had, doubled back past the British
right, necessitating a complete change of
plans. During the night of December 3,
General Knox encamped on the Carmcl
farm, the site of the Boer laager, which
had evidently been recently abandoned
and hurriedly moved. General Knox
started again at daylight,. hoping to cor
ner Dewet /while crossing Karrepoort
drift, but he arrived too late. The Brit
ish experienced very great difficulty In
following Dewet owing to the rise In the
river, but they succeeded in crossing with
out the loss of a man or a beast. From
that time on the pursuit of the Boers was
taken up -without baggage, the troops be
ing supplied by foragers, enabling them to
make more rapid movements and keep In
touch with the republicans.
A special from Cape Town says: Lord
Roberts arrived here to-day from Port
Elizabeth. He was accorded a splendid
reception. The Mayor. Councilors, the
citizens' committee and thousands of
sightseers met him at the docks and es
corted him to the Government House.

SHOOTS WITHOUT POWDER.
Centrifugal Force Sends Three Thou-
sand Shots a Minute.
Its Xewcastle-on-Tyne correspondent
Informs the London Times thet a machine
gun of a novel character has been invent
ed bv James Judge, a well known engineer
of Newcastle, who thus describes it: The
gun is a patent centrifugal quick-firing
machire gun; it is five feet high and
weighs about live hundredweight. It is
intended for battle-ship, earthworks and
garrison purposes. The motive power Is
electricity, transmitted to- a motor at
tached to the side of the sun. The motor
causes a disk to revolve at a very high
rate of speed. The bullets, which are in
troduced into tho Interior of the disk at
the axle, travel along curves in the. In
terior to the circumference, and are there
Impelled through a barrel. It is claimed
that this disk will rotate, under the in
fluence of the motor, at the rate of 15,000
revolutions a minute, and wilt eject shots
from the muzzle of the gun with an Initial
velocity of 2000 feet per second. One of
the chief characteristics of the gun is that
It will maintain a continuous fire. If
necessary, a shot may be discharged at
every half revolution, but in practice one
shot every fourth revolution will be found
sufficient. The bullets are sphericaland
measure 3-16-inch in diameter. â¢ N
"The following are the results of the te6ts
already made with the gun: Eighteen
thousand rounds of shot at the rate of
5000 a minute have been discharged from
thegun.' These shots consisted of nickel
steel, some of brass (as used in France),
lead and chilled metal. It was tested
seven times privately; no motor was used,
nor is one yet attached to the, gun, al
though the gun is constructed for an elec
tric motor. The tests were made by means
of a belt driven bv a stearrf engine. -Under
these conditions tno velocity required, and
which it is maintained an elecric motor
will produce, was not.^of course/attained,
but the. practical working of the gun was
fully demonstrated. A long range could
not.be had because of the necessity of
6ecrecy. and the testing was done in a
covered shed at Blyth drydocks. A steel
target 3-32-Inch thick was shattered, the
disk of the gun revolving at a speed of
2500 revolutions per minute. From the
penetration of the target it Is calculated
that at a distance of 400 yards a penetra
tion of a similar, character will be effected
of a plate 7-16-inch thick under the Influ
ence of an electric motor. There is no
heating of the barrel of the gun, because
of the continuous stream of cold air which
is impelled through it by the turning of
the disk. Tho disk itself Is also free from
heating on account of the special bearings
on which it is constructed. These bear
ings are a highly complicated mechanical
contrivance, and are similar to those used
In Parsons' turbines, which can revolve
at the rate of 22,000 revolutions a minute,
and Levall's motor, which revolves at the
rate of 30,000 revolutions a minute. To
test the gun thoroughly It will be neces
sary to nfilx a motor, which will be a live
horsepower motor coupled direct on to the
shaft. Â¦. . ,

AMERICAN TRIBUTE TO
MEMOEY OF KXNG ALFRED
ttt ONDON; Dec. 8.â The Chinese
I problem Is. so wrapped up in con
1 tradlctory dispatches and so
ii_-^ complicated by the multitudes of
notes and amendments thereto
that even the keenest diplomats frankly
confess they scarcely know how the situ
ation stands. From one particularly fa
miliar with the Americans' plans for
China it is learned that the negotiations
going on at all the capitals may be well
summed up as an effort to f;et the Chi
nese court to return to Peking. At last
the powers seem to realize that all the
able notes they could have formulated are
not worth the paper they are written on
until the powers are in touch with the
Chinese court. Providing this is accom
pliphed. which it is now hoped will be the
case, the powers are willing to make the
question of reparation secondary to the
establishment of a stable form of Chinese
government. When this is done, the ques
tion of Indemnity will come up. The
method of its exaction has not yet been
decided, though all agree that it cannot
be secured territorially.
Judging from the negotiations between
Mr. Choate, the United States Embassa
dor, and the Marquis oS. Lansdowne, Sec
retary Hay's suggestion that the powers
confer at "Brussels or some other place"
Is not likely to meet with the acceptance
of Great Britain. The other European na
tions bo far heard from are, inclined to
give their representatives at Peking a
fairly free hand and dread the additional
complications which they believe a Con
gress of the powers would entail. Other
wise Mr. Hay's latest propositions receive
on the whole general approval and prom
ise to form the basis for an eventual set
tlement. While the activity of the nego
tiations is not likely to flag within the
next few weeks, it Is the belief of those
best informed that they will not, or rather
cannot, result in anything definite until
the Ministers are personally in touch with
the Chinese court. There is no attempt
here to conceal the fact that in the efforts
to achieve this important result conces
sions from the original attitude of the
powers have been made to China,
Until This Is Accomplished
. All the Notes -Are
Worthless.
Powers Now Anxious for
the Return of Chinese
Court to Peking.
REPARATION
OF SECONDARY
IMPORTANCE
Will Be Made the Subject
of an Interpellation
in Reichstag,
?
ERLIN, Dec. 8.â Mr. Kruger's
non-reception here and the rea
sons leading thereto will be made
the subject of 1 an interpellation
in the Reichstag early in- the
coming week on the first budget debate.
The Imperial Chancellor, Count von Bu
low, will personally reply.
The excitement on the subject is still
deep and far reaching, as evidenced by to
day's Die Nation, which contains an arti
cle by Professor Theodore Mommsen, who
approves of Emperor William not receiv
ing the Boer statesman as being more dig
nified and more Just than if he received
him and then confessed his powerleasnesa
to avert the South African tragedy which
is now going on toward the final act. The
Vosslsche Zeitung takes a similar view,
and says that "hypocritical Fiance, which
is seeking to embroil Germany with Eng
land, would have left Germany in the
lurch, probably confederating with Eng
land against Germany, after succeeding
in rupturing the bonds of Anglo-German
friendship."
An editorial article in the Kreuz ZeU
tung on the subject of President McKin
ley's recent message is significant as ex
pressing the views and alms of the mod
erate German Agrarians. It says:
"It does not matttT if the Americans
lose the German meat trade, since Amer
ican manufactured imports to Germany
will enormously Increase, which is watch
ed anxiously in Germany. Austria-Hun
gary and Switzerland. If Germany in the
projected treaties imitates the Dingley
tariff, how can the Americans complain?
It would only be an act of self-defense."
The article then proceeds to enumerate
the many apparent unfairnesses In the
tariff relations with the United States.
The Cologne Volks Zeitung, the leading
Centrist organ, acknowledges the cease
less attempts of the United States Embas
sador, Mr. White, to further peace be
tween'the two countries, but claims ' hla
efforts are pooh-poohed and frustrated by
the Republican jingoes in America, who
are particularly venomous against Ger
many.

"A Few Doses Helps
Them."
One of the greatest foes with which ev-
ery family has to contend is our changea-
ble climate. To protect the family from
colds and coughs is always a serious prob-
lem, and often impossible.
Sooner or later it is the inevitable fate
of every one to catch cold. Care In avoid-
ing exposure and the use of proper cloth-
ing will protect from the frequency and
perhaps the severity of colds, but with
the greatest of precautions they will come.
This is a settled fact of human experi-
ence. "
Especially is this true during the stormy
and unsettled weather of early winter.
Everybody must expect to be caught
somewhere or somehow.
Perhaps it will be wet feet, or cold
draught, or damp clothes, or may be too
close confinement in hot rooms and then
going out into the cold carelessly, or It
may be ont> of a thousand other little mis-
haps, but no one is shrewd enough to al-
ways avoid the inevitable catching cold.
Sometimes colds come like an epidemic;
everybody seems to have, one at once.
The very air about us is Jpoison to the
head, throat and lungs.
There is no fact of medical science bet-
ter hfnown than that Peruna cures catarrh
wherever located. Thousands of families
in all parts of the United States are pro-
tected each winter by Peruna, Once in
the family Peruna always stays. No home
can spare Peruna after the first trial of it.
A Bplendld example of this fact is found
in the beautiful home of Mrs. Paul Pes-
How a Mother Saved Her Boy.
Mrs. E. L. Chomer, 5243 Emerald ave-
nue. Chicago. 111., writes: "I really don t

walk-out this afternoon In the general
offices of the Santa Fe here took the offi
cials by surprise. For a time C. G. Sholes,
superintendent of telegraph, and C. W.
Kouns, superintendent of car service, left
their places at the keys and did the regu
lar work. The officials have not yet de
cided what action to take to-morrow.
There la much consternation among the
Santa Fe shopmen of this city as the re
sult of the order of General Manager
Madge throwing them out of employment
In case the strike reached such propor
tions as to tie up business. \
The strike Is caused by troubles over
rules and regulations. The wage scale
was up for consideration, but the road
agreed to arbitrate oa that point. The
rules and regulations have been up and
were not eettlbd. The road would not
agree to the rules asked by the men and
the strike results.
The Santa Fe operators of this city will
hold a meeting to-morrow morning at 8
o'clock to consider what their future ac
tions will be. With two exceptions every
Santa Fe operator in the city is out. The
operators are confident that business here
will be tied up to-morrow. Twenty op
erators were brought here from Chicago
last night by the officials in anticipation
of the strike, but none of them went to
work.
The dispatches reoelved here Indicate
that every office west of Topeka is closed.
This includes the offices on the branches
west of Albuquerque. Four operator* be
tween here and Kansas City have not yÂ»t
been reached by the strike order of the
O. R. T.. but will to-morrow, and the
strike will then be complete.
WICHITA. Kans.. L>ec 8.â Chairman
Newman made the following statement
to-night:
â¢ "The situation 1b about as follows to
night: The Oklahoma division, the Middle
division and the Eastern division report
all men out, and, with the exception of
about Fix men, alll in the Western division
are out. Officers have advised me that
the Santa Fe wires are open east and we
ere not able to do any work into Chicago.
Reports from west of Albuquerque to Los
Angeles and San Francisco are that all
men are out, and the situation could not
look brighter for the telegraphers than It
now is. The Gulf. Colorado and Santa Pe
men are still out and as firm as the day
they struck. There are something like
thirteen hundred telegraph employes on
the Santa Fe system, and It will be ut
terly impossible for the company to fill
their places. We are out and will stay out
until we win all of the conditions on which
we will return. One condition Is that all
of the scabbing operators must be dis
missed from the service of the Santa Fe."
WHY OPERATORS QUIT WOEK.
of the Men at tb.e Keys.
Officials Eefuse to Adjust Grievances
"WICHITA. Kans., Dec. 8.â Chairman J.
A. Newman of thÂ© Santa Fe division of
the Order of Railroad Telegraphers, In
cluding the entire Banta Fe system. Issued
the following order at 3:30 o'clock this aft
ernoon, and a few minutes later he was
Informed that 1300 operators over the en
tire system quit the key:
"To all agents and operators of the
Santa Fe system: In accordance with the
action of your general committee and the
by-laws of this organization, on this date
you will strike, cease work and thereafter
refuse to perform any duty of any charac
ter whatever until the said strike Is de
clared off by me personally and notice of
settlement of all your grievances ac
knowledged. Said notice must be vouched
for by our local representatives. You will
turn your board red for the protection of
life and property and leave them In that
position permanently. Carefully protect
all company property in your care or pos
session and allow no person access there
to until you are properly checked and re
leased from all responsibility by the com
pany's actual representative. This action
is made necessary to secure for you rea
sonable compensation and conditions of
service. All train dispatchers, clerks and
other employes are earnestly requested to
give us their assistance."
Referring to his order. Chairman New
man said:
"Thia action was taken up at lhe sug
gestion of National President Dolphin and
only after it was evident that the com
pany would not listen to our grievances
We were compelled to take this sten to
see that justice is done to the members of
our organization on the Gulf system and
as a matter of protection to ourselves If
the Santa Fe Company cut wages and'im
posed other burdens upon the operators
of that system, what is to prevent them
from doing the same thing here? This is
not altogether In eympathy with the Gulf
operators. My order caused over 1S00 op
erators to strike. There Js one thine I am
glad of. and that is the fact that the men
are a unit In the matter. I am receiving
telegrams from all points Indorsing my
action. Just how long the strike will con
tinue is a matter hard for me to deter

DISCUSSING THE
CANTEEN BILL
The Board of Education will in all prob
ability rescind its assignment of Mrs.
Irene D. Reeves to the Chinese Primary
School at next Wednesday's meeting. Mrs.
Reeves sent a communication yesterday
to the board in which she gives notice that
she. will accept the assignment only under
protest. She is the teacher who was re
cently Informed by Chairman Mark that
unless she withdrew her suit against the
board to have her high school standing
determined she would never be assigned,
to a regular class.
The board, however, evidently reconsid
ered its determination, for at the last
meeting Mrs. Keeve3 was assigned to the
Chinese School. It is interesting to notÂ©
in this connection that Mrs.\Kate Turney
and Aliss M. II. Blavan, who were bent to
the school, are now respectively on the
retired list and substitute list. It was
probably with a similar object in view
that the board assigned Mrs. Reeves to
the Chinese School, which is not consid
ered a desirable school by many teachers.
Mrs. Reeves calls attention to the fact
that the board ignored the chronological
order which it has pledged itself to follow
by recently assigning Miss J. Frank, elect
ed December 2fc, l&itf, to the James LJck
School; Mies L.. O'Connell, elected June
9. 1&97. to the Pacilic Heights, and Miss G.
Carroll, elected June 9, 1897, to the John
Swett School. All these dates are subse
quent to that of Mrs. Reeves' election,
which was on February 10, 1897.
Mrs. Reeves' specific ground of her pro
test is that the board has no right to de
grade her in her standing. She has taught
in the Girls' High and Polytechnic High
schools and says she has the highest cre
dentials from the principals.
President Mark says that the board is
justified in not having followed the
chronological order in Mrs. Reeves' case.
"Mrs. Reeves Is at law with the board,"
says Mark, "and we first asked the City
Attorney how we were affected by the lit
igation. His assistant, W. F. Brobeck.
informed us that we could appoint her to
a position. I do not know what the board
will do in regard to her accepting It under
protest. It Btrikes me that a teacher so
ooing will not accomplish the best results.
Some action will certainly be taken. She
has written a letter to the board waiving
her right to a high school position.
stations. To avoid the strike the com
mittee agreed to accept Santa Fe rules,
amended by providing for eight consecu
tive hours' rest In twenty-four, excepting
In cases of emergency. The clause de
priving men of a hearing when discharged
for Insubordination was also to bo elimi
nated. Another demand made was that
there was not to be any reduction In
wages at any of the stations for the pres
ent. We will Btand by the men of the Qulf
and fight this battle to a finish."
All the Santa Fe trains are said to be
tied up In this division, between Newton
and Purcell. No operator was working
after 6 o'clock except two at Arkansas
City and one at Perry, Oklahoma. Divi
sion Superintendent TIce Is trying to bring
the night train in. but it Is not expected
that he will succeed. Three freights and
a. passenger are tied up here, and a tele
phone message from Wellington says that
everything is dead on the Panhandle divi

his flagship the Iowa, accompanied by the

o'clock to-night In pursuance of orders
from Washington. Ostensibly the fleet Is
merely taking its regular winter cruise,
which may extend south as far ac Aca
jutla, Salvador. If this he the case it is
deemed strange here that the departure
should not be delayed a few hours. AH
arrangements had been made for a ball at
the Hotel Coronado In honor of the ad

Kautz was among the patrons. The ball
is in progress, but the gentlemen of the
navy in whose honor it was arranged are
far down the coast. It is suggested here
that a considerate Navy Department
would not have hurried the ships away in
view of the circumstances unless the mis
sion were more imperative than a mere
cruise.
In view of the very decided stand taken
by the State Department in regard to'

SAIL FOR THE SOUTH
EUREKA, Dec. 8.-Mildred Durphy/
daughter of Bradley F. Durphy, head of
the Industrial department of the Vance
Redwood Lumber Company, commenced
suit to-day against C. E.Pearsall, the well
known timber land dealer, for defamation
of character. She asks for $20,000 dam
ages. This action is the climax to a num
ber of sensations which have sprung from
the marital affairs of B. F. Durphy. who
is now under arrest on a charge preferred
by a woman who calls herself Margaret
Durphy. In her complaint Margaret Dur
phy alleges thnt while. she was the wife
of the defendant he was openly living
with another woman, whom he afterward
married. The suit of Miss Mildred Dur
phy the daughter, 'springs out of this
charge against her- father. She alleges
that G. E. Pearsall slandered her by say
ing: - .
n l do not believe that she is Durphy's
daughter. I believe she Is some tancy
woman he is keeping."
Between Pearsall and- Durphy, the
father of Mildred Durphy, there has been
*n enmity for some time. The two men
were associated in promoting .the sale of
the John . Vance Mill and Lumber. Com
pany nlant to Eastern capitalists. They
differed and began airing their troubles
In the courts, each attacking the char
acter of the other, Durphy still worked
on the sale of the. Vance plant and suc
ceeded two months ago in disposing of it
to A. B. Hammond of Missoula, Montana,
and others, who Incorporated as the
Vance Redwood Lumber Company. With
this new company Durphy accepted a
position as manager. of the industrial de
partment.

PEN'NGROVE, Dec. 8. -John Peter Sie
mens, a well known German citizen o*
Penngrove, Is confined, In a prison at
Hamburg, Germany, and according to re
cent advioeB received by relatives her*
he will not fare easily at the hands of
the Government of his fatherland. Eight
years ago Siemens, then a-boy of about
17 years, departed from his native coun
try, taking up his residence here with his
uncle, the late B. Harms. Being subject
to military service at the time of his de
parture, he pledged himself in writing to
return and serve 'out his time whenever
the Government should require him to do
so. In due time Siemens was notified to
return, but Instead of complying with his
promise he informed the officials that he
had not the least intention of spending
the allotted two years in the army.
Meanwhile Siemens became a natural
ized citizen of the United States, and be
litvlnp that this removed his liability to
service in the German army he left here
last September for a six months' visit
at home. No sooner was his presence In
Germany made known to the officials
than he was placed in iail, where he will
be compelled to remain until a $300 tine
is served out, after which he must serve
three years in the army.

The word "bedlam" is a corruption of
the word "Bethlehem." and originated as
a synonym for chaos at the time when the
house of Bethlehem, occupied by a ilBter
hood in London, became an insane asy
lum. The treatment of the insane In the
early part of the sixteenth century was
not well understood, and It was necessary
to frighten the patient out of his lunacy.
All Hurts of awful expedients were resort
ed to. among them "surprise floors."
which slipped from under the feet: "sur
prise baths" and flogging at the period of
most severe illness. Hence the -name
"bedlam." the result of incorrect spelling,
possibly, came easily to stand for awful
things.
What "Bedlam" Means.

A curious story comes from London to the effect that Lord Beauchamp's failure in the
office of Governor of New South Wales was due mainly to the fact that he has no wife. It is stated,
moreover, that the objection of colonials to bachelor governors .is so well known to the authorities
in London that many aspirants for colonial governorship have been barred out because they were
unmarried, and, according to the Westminster Gazette, some of them have been known to qualify
by getting married in a hurry: The cause of the colonial objection is not stated, but probably the
ladies of the country desire, something of social life at their colonial capitals andmake it red hot for
any one who tries to keep up no more style than is required for bachelor quarters. It would seem
that Beauchamp might have arranged matters by parrying some fair Australian,. but he preferred
to quit the job.: . :.*,, â¢
THE contemplated organization of the fruit-growers of the whole State is a promise of great
benefit to that leading industry., A compact organization that will study methods and mar
kets is one of the great needs of the fruit interest. Heretofore organization has been special
ized. We have had associationsof the citrus fruit growers and the prune and raisin producers.
But each of these has considered the welfare of its specialproduction only.
Now a close association that covers the whole fieldâ orchard and vineyard, deciduous and
citrus fruit alike â will teach- the community of interest, inculcate the principle of commercial
honor and spread abroad information as. to markets, distribution and methods that will make the
fruit-grower more nearly the master of his own affairs.
The foreign market especially needs consideration. Since the State Board of Trade made a
fruit exhibit at Hamburg our German market has increased more than tenfold and our whole
European market has been favorably affected. We have in Australia a large reciprocal market lhat
needs intelligent cultivation. The Australians are people of great and intelligent enterprise and
with a consuming power that deserves the respect of the American producer. Their season is the
antipode of ours and their produce should find a constantly enlarging market on this coast, to be
reciprocated- by a demand in Australia for our product in their season of non-production. Sc*,;on
both sides of Californiaâ east and westâ are markets whose, absorbing capacity is of interest to us.
To study them and fit the preparation of our fruit product to their tastes will be the func
tion of such an association as is proposed. . : O'
The producer should not always be # at the mercy of the middleman and the market/ He
should have information at first hands and should know, not only the condition of his crop, but
that of the expectant market and of competing crops in other parts of the world. In other words,
the California fruit-grower should be an interstate and international merchant, in possession of all
knowledge required to protect his own interests and care for his own profits.
"At Fort Sheridan yesterday Abraham
Haarecber, a soldier of the United States
array of twenty years' service, shot and
killed himself near the post flagstaff."â
Chicago dally papers of Nov. 15.
This brief little paragraph was practi
cally the only obituary notice given to
one of thÂ« best soldiers who ever wore
a uniform and to a man whose life, al
tho'jgh It lay along the lines of the sim
ple duties of an enlisted man, was in
many ways remarkable. Abraham
Haarscher thirty-two years ago was a
poldier of France. lie was an Alsatian
by birth and under the flag of the em
pire he fought through the Franco-Prus
t?ian war. At the end of the disastrous
conflict, when Haarseher found that his
native province had become a ppoil to the
enemy, he became embittered. He left
his country and came to America, enlist
ing in the United States army, as he
could then do under the law, immediately
upon his arrival. Until the day of his
<2eath last week at Fort Sheridan Abra
ham Haarscher never passed an hour,
save when on his occasional leaves of
absence, beyond Eight of the flag that
marked either camp or garrison of
Uncle Earn.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Haarscher carried one record that is
probably unique In the histories of the
Â¦world. In twenty-nine years' service, al
though a model of neatness, discipline
and intelligence, he never wore the stripe
of a non-commissioned officer. He did
not know what the inside of a guard
house looked like from a prisoner's point ;
nt view. There was no soldier in camp
or barracks whose rifle and equipments
were like unto his. At guard mount the
neatest soldier is always chosen for the
duties ol orderly to the commanding of
ilcer. When Haarscher was detailed for
puard no man thought of competing with
him. Time after time he was offered the
position of non-commissioned officer, and
time after time he refused. Why, no ono
<"vcr knew. During the course of his
twenty-nine years as one of Uncle Sam's
soldiers Haarscher sawservicein four dif
ferent regiments and against every form
cf foe that his adopted country had to
face durlcff tho years covered by his en
listments and re-enlistments. Few men
knew like this private- what devotion to
duty meant. Ho was intensely proud of
his French nativity. Ono night at a far
Northwestern garrison he was walking
pcEt as a eentinel upon a frail temporary
bridge thrown across a stream. The ends
of the structure marked the ends of his
beat. A ttcrm arose in sudden fury. The
Ftream roeÂ© rapidly and the bridge be
gan to give way. Haarscher kept on
v.-alklng biÂ» post. Tho timbers were
creaking under his feet and thÂ« water
v.-as beginning to creep over the plank
ing, when the officer of thÂ© day appeared
ax thÂ© end of thÂ© bridge. He saw thÂ©
sentinel and his peril.
"Come off that bridge. No. 5," he yelled
above the storm. Haarscher walked calm
ly oil the bridge and came to an "arms
port."
"Haarscher, you dâ d fool, didn't you
know tha bridge was going?" Even as
liÂ© spoke the frail structure was whirled
away.
"That waa-ciy post, lieutenant,'* said
Private Haarscher, "and you forget that
I am a Frenchman."
Private Haarscher was a dandy. The
neatness of his equipment has been told.
Once a man who had the reputation of
never having lost the position of "orderly"
at. guard mount came from another regi
ment and re-enlisted in Haarscher's com
mand. The two privates, as luck would
have it. were detailed for guard the same
day. The whole garrison turned out to
eee which one the adjutant would pick for
the coveted place. The officer spent about
twenty minutes examining the rifles,
waist belts, cartridge boxes and brasses
of the two men. There was absolutely
nothing to choose between them In point
of neatness of appearance. Finally, as a
last resort, the adjutant unbuttoned the
blouse of tho new claimant for orderly
honors. He found a somewhet faded but
clean undershirt The adjutant passed to
Haarscher and opened three buttons of
his coat. Hasrscher had on a brand new
tuit of silk underwear that must have
cott him a month's pay. It was the other
man on that day who walked post in the
hot sun, while Haarscher did "lolling"
duty in the shade in front of the com
mandant's quarters.
The morals of the Franco-American sol
dier were like his rifle at guard mount
spotless. There -were no low camp or gar
rison intrigues for him. He was a pleas
ure lover, however, and he joined in all
the entertainments that went to lighten
the evenings of the soldier life. At no
dance or "hop under the auspices of Com- I
pany A" was there any particular attend
ing maiden singled out for the attentions
of Private Haarscher. He went the rounds Â¦
and danced with aJl. During the years he
saw his comrades marry and leave the '
service. They told him his day would
come. He laughed at them. For twenty
eight years he wer.t on in his but little
varying path of duty, with occasional
turnings aside into the ways of pleasure.
Then this supposedly confirmed old bach
elor soldier fell In love. He met the sis
ter of a former comrade. She was thirty
years hisj junior. To this girl he gave all
the Intensity of love that had marked
through the long years his devotion to
duty. He was utterly changed. The sol
dier who had faced unharmed the bullets
of Apache, Sioux and Spaniard was at last
wounded by a tiny shaft from the bow of
tha pigmy Cupid. No woman ever had
more devoted lover than that veteran.
One night only last week he went to her
home In Lake Forest and tcld her. HÂ©
spoke Tvith the same spirit in which he
hud replied to the officer' of the day when
he was ordered from his cost on the
bridge on that awful night near the head
waters of the Mjsscuri. The girl's answer
was no, and Hap.rscher knew that she
meent it.
Private Haarschcr left Lake Fore?t and
went to his quarters at Fort Sheridan. In,
a few moments he left the barracks and
walked across one corner of the parade
ground. He took one last look at the flag
fluttering at the masthead ai;d ended his
life with a bu!let. A coward's death, some
may say. No braver coldier than Abra
ham Haarscbcr ever wore a uniform. This
statement Is born not of belief only but
cf the knowledge of one who was glad to
call him comrade.

THE FRUIT-GROWERS.
To state over and over the. sordid conditions which appear in this country, and to decry the
merely material aim which is the admitted odium of any social state, without giving a clearly de
fined remedy, is only to induce a melancholy pessimism.- On the present' tide all men float. One
drop of water cannot turn against the current or wander at its own will. . It is part of the stream
and must stay with its fellows. Nor can one man leave the great company and by leaving change
In a commonwealth where all are striving to acquire beyond the needs of existence, the one
who holds back simply finds himself -.without the means of living. But where shall the line be
drawn on the acquisition of wealth, and by whom? â i
This is the vital question, the great issue, the crux of the whole matter. When society con
cludes to limit wealth to a certain figure by distributing to public use all that is acquired above
that figure, that proposition will constitute a base line from which to measure and consider the
remedy. It will be seen that 'his would be an assertion of the social power over property.- It is al
ready asserted in another form in the homestead exemption and the exemption from execution.
[^[SHOP POTTER is a commanding figure in the civil and the ecclesiastical world. His ut-:
f"*3terances are thoughtful and deserve thb attention they receive.
His latest talk on the sordid tendency of the times, as far as reported, is an arraignment
of a social symptom, but does not deal with the cause nor the remedy, except the general sug
gestion that the churches must take higher ground than they now occupy.
We are not prepared to admit that the churches can, curb a tendency that has appeared in all
society, under all polities and in the presence of all forms of the religious idea. But we do admit that
the co-operation of religious teachers, with the influence of secular schools, and' the conscience of
men, may regulate the movement of society and direct it to other ideals than mere wealth, as the
standard of excellence. Property exists by the consent of society. Society can obsolete all private
property if it choose. By withdrawal of its consent to the existence of. those forms of possession .
which are the expression of wealth, it can evaporate wealth itself, and bring human exertion with
in the limit that is required fox mere existence.
The present era of wealth and the existing struggle to attain it which make up the sordid
feature of the age began in this country with the general inculcation of the shrewd maxims of Ben
jamin Franklin in his "Poor Richard's Almanac." Up to the advent of the present active genera- â¢
tion those maxims were current and served to fix the mind Qn the necessity of acquisition. "He
who by the plow would thrive, himself must either hold or drive," "Take care of the pence and the
pounds will take care of themselves," "A penny saved is a penny earned," and many others, teach
a purely material doctrine of economy and thrift. Â¦â¢<:> Â¦..'Â¦â¢:'Â¦ -â¢
Franklin himself had known poverty and want, and worked his way out of those conditions
by practicing what his "Poor. Richard" preached. The American people, being the most ener
getic in the world, and owning the richest part of the richest continent on the planet, have acquired
the taste for the winnings of enterprise, and so life in this country is influenced by a longing for
the Midas touch which transforms the latent resources of nature into gold.
The intellect that is directed into money-making channels, if diverted into others would
make therein an equally high mark. Bishop Potter desires that it be diverted, to the end that
wealth shall not be the sole mark' of American genius and the single standard of excellence.
The Greek mind was of finer fiber than any known to the world since. It was directed al
most wholly to art and literature by the peculiar polity of Jhe Greek commonwealth. No great of
fices were therein provided as the prize of ambition or the means of getting wealth. This turned
the Greek mind to other avenues, and as a result there rose a literature that is yet splendid in its
ruins, and art and science, builder! upon the archaic examples of Egypt, touched some heights that
the modern world has not excelled. "The Isles of Greece" were gilded by some of the highest vic
tories of the finite mind:
, - Eternal sunshine gilds them yet, ; . .. . ..
But all beside that sun is set.
The Greek commonwealth fell. Rome, that pursued other ideals, in politics and the acqui
sition of wealth, fell, and present civilization quarries in the ruins of both.
No man can say that any social organization is to have immortality, nor that either wealth
or its opposite ideal can breathe into it the deathless essence.

l0gy \ â¢ . .-
Mr. Bouvier ' has promised us a new
opera-house, and what Mr. Bouvier prom
ises Is as good as accomplished. The best
of luck, then, to the new enterprise! May
It be worthy the heart that has felt for
our needs and the brain that is planning
to satisfy them! . ....
It Is In this new opera-house, controlled
by Mr. Bouvier and his friends, that M.
Grau's company, will ; sing, I suppose, If
they return to us next year. If this is so,
it is not too early to put in a pleaâ no, to
claim as a rightâ that we shall not be af
flicted with" some of the nuisances that
flourished unchecked by Mr. Bouvier (per
haps because uncheckable by him) during
the recent season. First among these Is
the nuisance of the ill-printed, flaring ad
vertising programme^-a vulgar Imposition
upon people who have already paid for
three hours' enjoyment more than the
average day laborer can save in a month.
Second-Is the nuisance of the dirty-fin
gered,! loud-mouthed libretto boy, who is
allowed to roam up and down the aisles,
shouting his wares and even thrusting:
them impudently into the faces of people
who refuse to buy. Such gamins, whose
uncieanliness and not whose poverty is
their reproach, are not now permitted to
board street cars: much more should they
be banished from a place to which people
resort for the. express purposes of esthetic
enjoyment. The libretto boy is a relic from
the . old pit ' days of orange-vending
wenches ' and ' quarreling apprentices; hp
Jk * R. GRAU'S receipts during his
lyl short season can scarcely have
II been less than $225,000. and the
I I joke is on us. Small wondar then
I I that he departs in merry mood
and keeps up to the end his repu
tation as a humorist. For proof: In an
interview published in last Sunday's Call,
after expressing his appreciation of our
appreciation of him. he went on to say
that San Francisco* appreciation of the
Niebelungen Tetralogy "is perhaps sur
prising from its difficulty of comprehen
sion on first hearing."
This must refer, of course, to the musi
cal portion of that work, for there is
nothing in the drama portion which could
not have been written (as Dr. Johnson
said of Macpherscn's "Ossian") by many
men, by many women and even by many
children. , -
Let us consider briefly whether The dif
ficulties of the Niebelungen Tetralogy are
really difficulties worth conquering, be
cause, when conquered, they result in
higher emotional and intellectual enjoy
ment, or whether they are merely ob
scurations due to Wagner's feeble grasp
of the true distinction between the arts
of music and of poetry. This whole ques
tion has been so searchingly analj*2ed by
Nordau in the fifth chapter of the second
book of his "regeneration" that It would
be absurd for me here to attempt any
thing more than an indication of the line
of his argument.
The chief characteristics of the music
of Wagner's later years are the Lelt-Motif
and the Unending Melody. The Lelt-
Motif is a musical phrase to which Is
arbitrarily attached a definite concept;
whenever a certain character appears
upon the stage the orchestra gives the
Lert-Motlf. This musical phrase dees not
necessarily call up tho concept to the
mind of the auditor, because music In
Itself is absolutely incapable of expressing
abstract- thought; the utmost it can do is
to suggest those optical phenomena which
are ordinarily accompanied by acoustic
phenomena. Music cannot even eay,
"This is a sword": much less can it say,
"This is jealousy," or "This is love." or
"This is vaulting ambition that o'er
leaps itself." The Leit-Motifs, then, are
nothing but hieroglyphics, undecipherable
without a key; when deciphered they are
found to be merely unsuccessful attempts
to express by one art (music) what is al
ready admirably expressed by another art
(poetry)- Can Nordau then be said to put
it too strongly when he asks: "Is any
thing more needed to expose the complete
insanity of this confusion of all the means
of expression, this ignorance of what Is
possible to each art?"
Next, as to the "Unending Melody." A
melody (we are still following: Nordau) is
a regular grouping of notes In an ex
pressive series of tones; It corresponds In
language to a. sentence; that is, to a series
of. words clearly, and logically presenting
one Idea. Just as a definite* firmly grasped
thought i3 bound to seek its linguistic ex
pression in the mode of a sentence, so Is
a definite, clearly realized emotion bound
to seek its expression in the mode of a
melody. "Melody may be said to be an
effort of music to say something definite.
It is clear that an emotion unconscious of
its cause and alms and unilluminated by
attention will not raise its musical ex
pression to the height of melody, precise
ly because it has nothing definite to say."
But deflnlteness of thought and feeling
is characteristic of the civilized man; in
definlteness of thought and feeling of the
uncivilized man. Primitive races are just
as incapable of elaborating a melody as
I they are of elaborating a complex sen
tence. Witness the music of Hindoos and
the Chineseâ a music that has never ad
vanced beyond the recitative stage. (From
this stage it is but a step back to the
monotonous dance chant of the savage.)
Now the Wagnerian "Unending Melody"
(a contradiction In terms, by the way) Is
recitative, pure and simple; it is therefore
a more primitive form of musical art than
is the melody proper; it is In no true sense
the music of the future, but Is truly the
music of the past. Wagner's return to
this outworn form, his insistence upon its
originality and its merit are merely illus
trations of the irresistible power of that
law of atavism which so often forces
back into the old and beaten paths of the
past those who fondly think they are blaz
ing their way through the undiscovered
country* of the future.
â¢ â¢ ' â¢
It will be remembered that In "The
School for Scandal" the lovers, Charles
and Maud, do not meet until near the
close of the last act â too late for them to
have a strong love scene. Sheridan was
once sharply criticized for this as a de
fect of construction, but he was equal to
the occasion. He declared that ..'he
omitted the love scene on purpose, be
cause Jack Palmer had to play Charles,
and Jack could never carry off a love
scene!
This ingenious invention of an a pos
teriori theory to explain the > fact Is not
confined to Sheridan. Wagrier uses the
same device when, in "The Art Work of
the Future" <1830) he advanced the
theories of the Leit-Motlf and of the Un
ending Melody to cover up his incapacity
for producing another "Lohengrin" or an
other "Tanrihauser" â works that do con
tain true melodies. "He was Incapable
of distinguishing the personages of his
operas by a purely musical characteriza
tion and therefore he invented the Lelt-
Motlf. Experiencing a great difficulty,
especially with advancing age, in creating:
true melodies, he set up the postulate of
the Unending Melody." ' iv. v
â¢ â¢ . â¢
The facts herein set forth are perfectly
patent to any one who will take the
trouble to read Herbert Spencer's "Essay
on the Origin and Function of Music"
and Nordau's "Remarks on Mysticism."
This brief summary of those simple ex
positions Is modestly presented here In
the. candid hope that It may assist the
reader to a full enjoyment- of Mr. Grau's
humorous remarks as to the "difficulty"
of comprehending the Niebelungen Tetra-
should be abolished, as they hrrve been.
Garrick performed a real service to his
profession when he drove gallants off the
stage and suppressed the tiffhtingr valet*
who were reserving seats for their mas
ters. Let Mr. Bouvier perform an equally
real service by driving out the money
changeis who profane the temple of music
and by suppressing the libretto boy. Let
soap and water, vigorously applied, first
spread their antiseptic sphere of influence
around that boy. and then l?t .him he
packed off to the night school. So may we
enjoy our oper-Â» in peace, and so may hÂ«
grow up a good citizen, trainer! in the
practice of that virtue which Is more than
next to godlinessâ which is. In truth, a
part of godliness itself.

Just brfor* the French troops retired
from Mexico in 1966, eaya Edward B. Clark
In th-? Chicago Times-Herald, following
closely upon Sew.ird's famous communica
tion beginning, "We view with regret,"
General Phil , Sheridan, as everybody
knows, was sent with an army corps of
veterr.ns freeh from the victories attend
ing the sweep through the Shenandoah
end the subsequent campaigning up to the
gate of Richmond. Two regiments of Lit
tle Phil's command were isolated from
the rest of the outfit and were stationed
on the frontier ;vst across the river from
a place where a contingent of Maxi
milian's troops he'd a fort. Some of the
Juarez republican soldiers started up
across country to take this fortification,
which was among the last to hold out.
The republican troops went Into camp
tibout two miles away from the fortifica
tion, which was nothing more than a re
doubt with Trails rather higher than those
of the ordinary "thrown-up" defense. The
Americans from their side of the river, by
the aid of their. glasses, saw the approach
of Juarez's solci^rs. and it goes without
paying that subsequent proceedings inter
ested them intensely.
The Mexican troops were dresed in white
uniforms, and the day after their arrival
the Americans saw them leave their camp,
pass up under cover of the river bank and
a bit of timber and then emerge into the
open not nore than "30 yards from the
fortification behind which the Frenchmen

were grimly watchins the approach. Sud
denly the republican line broke Into a
charge and headed straight for the re
doubt. The Frenchmen opened a palling
fire and the white line wavered, broke and
fled faster by several yards to the second
than it had advanced.
Every morning regularly for a week the
Yankee soldiers to the north of the river
saw the Mexicans come out, form, charge,
break and .fly. The whole Yankee camp
took a lively interest in these proceedings
until they became monotonous, when only
a handful of the Northern troopers would
turn out to look at the regular after
reveille attack.
â¢ * â¢
One night the American regimental ad
jutant visited all the officers of the com
mand. Then there were talks with the
first sergeants, and after that the privates
got an lr.klins that something was up.
Later in the night a visitor to the camp
of the Americans If he were a close ob
server would have noticed that about one
third of the men were missing. In the
morning the two-thirds that were leftâ
every member of the outfit save the guard
âlined the north bank of the Rio Grande
and stood watching Maximilian's redoubt.
Pretty soon from a point far down to, the
left the republican troops with their white
uniforms emerged. There appeared to be
onlf about half as many of them as usual.
They marched to a point no more than
two hundred yards away from the fort,
and seemed to pay less attention than
usual to the shots that went through their
ranks. They reached the place where it
was their custom to form for a charge,
and then, changing from column into line,
they swept for the redoubt like a storm.
They reached the foot of the parapet,
passed up and over and Into It like un
leashed war dogs. There were Fhouts,
shots and yells, and then in a moment the
flag of republican Mexico had replaced
that of the Emr^eror Maximilian.
It was then that a curious thing oc
curred. Another regiment of republican
troops emerged from the tents where the
camp had been pitched ten days before
and marched up and into the redoubt.
They had no sooner entered than the
white-coated detachment which had cap
tured the place moved out. '

A queer sight presented itself. The sol

had taken the redoubt passed down the
river and out of sight into a clump of
trees. There, stranger sight than all. they
threw off the white cloth suits of repub
lican Mexico and donned the army blue of

New Observatory Buildings at Three
Points Favorable for Making of
Meteorological Observa
tions Projected.
There la a fair prospect that the weath
er service on the Pacific Coast will be im
proved in very important particulars in
the near . future. For years there has
been pressure to have an island station
in the ocean off the Pacific Coast connect
ed with the mainland of the United States
by 'cable. Professor Willis 1^. Moore, the
wide-awake chief of the AVealher Bureau,
has betn considering the needs. of this
coast. News has reacned this city through
a private source that Secretary Wilson
of tho Department of Agriculture has
agreed wltn Professor Moore that there
ought to be and has recommended a cable
from Tatcosh Island, oft the coast of
Washington, to the mainland. Â«TliÂ© Secre
tary win recommend such cable and also
that observatory buildings shall be con
structed at Point, Crescent, Tatoosh and
Canby. Â¦
This news concerns all dwellers on the
coast for two reasons. One Is that the
weather service will be greatly improved
by these additions, especially by the cable
from Tatoosh Island, which will enable
much early information to be received
concerning the coming in of storms from
the ocean. ! The other reason is that the
recommendation of Secretary Wilson does
not necessarily Insure the institution of
the work, for an appropriation is neces
sary. Manifestations of public interest
and approval on the Pacific Coast and re
quests to Pacific Coast Senatorial and
Congressional delegations to work for the
necessary appropriation will undoubtedly
do much toward securing it.
An intimation has also been received
that there is a possibility that another
professor will be appointed in the Weather
Bureau. Alexander George McAdle of
this city may be the man. He has a fine
renatatlon throughout the country as a
meterorologist and also for executive abil
ity and enterprise. In addition to tho ex
tensions referred to Secretary Wilson has
also recommended on suggestion of Pro
fessor Moore that there shall be national
forecast officers at Boston for the New
England district, at Galveston for the
Western Gulf district and at Denver for
the Rocky Mountain district.

one of the best wells In one of the best oil
iirL * ln the count y w as drilled at the spot
which afterward proved to be the one that
would have been selected by the superintend
ent had he been able to see into the ground
and count the barrels underneath. It happened"
m tnis way. An employe was directed to stake
out a road to be built so that teams could haul
to a flat somewhere on the top of which a hole
was to be started. He marked the route, and.
navlng a slncle stake left, a l&rge one. he
drove it Into the ground at the upper end of
the road. The teamster, after they had scraped
out the sldehill to allow the passage of their
wagons dumped the lumber for the derrick at
;C? , p . olnt where the large stake was driven,
thinking that it had been set to eulde them.
Then the rig builders continued the error and
the first thing the authorities knew an outfit
was ready for operation where nobody could
see any signs of oil. but they had the nerve to
fo ahead, with the result that they found
l^hi m u e fS tne PÂ° 8ses sor of a great producer,
which will make, them rich. Â¦
The Westlake Oil Company, of Los An
ples-has thirty-two producing wells and
is about to sink others. It is the intention
or tne reorganized management to use the
revenue derived from the producing wells
L n pu i tln & In additional ones. This' course
nas been decided upon by reason of a
clause in the lease on the property, which
provides that the company may enjoy the
possession of the property for seven years
but that all wells must be drilled within
three years.
Six companies are operating at San
Pedro. Three have found indications of
oil. ,
The Bella Vista Oil Syndicate Is rapidly
completing arrangements preparatory to
active operations on its large acreage In
san Mateo County. The officials have
contracted for a telephone line to extend
a distance of four miles from their, works
to Sunset connections.
With a record of nearly 200 oil wells
completed last month and over 650 begin
ning to drill in one month, there is little
occasion to call the progress of the oil
Industry in California slow. - There i are'
several new dietricts in which prospecting
is going on. Still the greater part of the
work is proceeding i Q the older districts.
Wo one knows how rich these districts
are. Where the- oil belt has been located
JO.* ii n , r Coun ty. In Los Angelea County
and Â«ln Ventura County, a series of sur-
P rls , es have awaited the men engaged in
exploiting the State's resources in petro
leum.
The new districts where capital is in
vested, and where indications lead the
P r Â° s P ec tor to be active, are sufficiently
widely scattered to convince Eastern peo-
i e w Â« h Â£ take tr Â«uble to become acquaint-
f d wit ,h the facts that the Industry, like
me mining industry, is far from attain
ing its proper stature. State Mineralo
gist cooper Is confident that there are as
good districts in the State yet undeveloped
|* s Â£ ave been discovered. The production
a November is estimated to have exceed
ed the output of October by over 1400
barrels^ daily. The enterprise is on the
basis of an established industry In many
localities. As development has extended
the price of lands within the limits of
J,?.j rl y well-defined belts has advanced.
The Pacific Oil Reporter of recent date
lumlsnes some figures on this latter point
mat are of Interest. Says the Reporter:
Pr Â°bably there have been few instances in
}Â£* nl^ tor y of real estate transactions where
there has been isuch a marked Increase In land
values as In the Kern River field. The rail
fSi . comDan y held its alternate sections in
this district at II :s an acre until the oil dis
covery was apparent, when" it was raised to
5- 50 an acre, but it Is probable that twenty-five
cents an acre under the desert land law would
De nearer its actual value and more In ac
cordance with the price that could be got for
the land, ae it was too far below the level of
the Kern River to be available for irrigation,
and natural rainfall was too light to make |t
of any value for agriculture. A year is spont
In developing thÂ« oil resources of the section
and, then sales are reported at significant
prices. The northeast quarter of section 8, ly
ing on the- very edge of the district.- wont for
U6.000. People paid JS500 an acre for eighteen
acres in section 26, 2S-28, a short time ago.
The San Joaquin has closed a contract made
six months ago, when land values were much
lower than they are now. by which it is to
receive J87.000 for eighty acres In the southwest
quarter of cectlon 6, 29-28. realizing nearly J1100
per acre, and a contemporary published In that
locality intimates that present values are much
higher. Probably no more remarkable rise in
prices of desert land In so short a time has
been recorded in California, even in the palm
iest days of the orange boom.
The local papers published In the sev
eral oil sections are filled with headlines
like "Work in Full Swing"; "Drill and
Pump Active"; "Development Is Speed
ing," etc., which indicates to even the
casual observer that energy Is back of
the work. In San Diego County, accord
ing to the San Diego Union, the opera
tions are not confined to the coast sec
tion. The Union says:
Recently increased evidences of oil have beÂ«n
noted on the waters of the Colorado, where
sras has been escaping: for owr a year. Near
the holes formed by the bubbling gas. which
In themselves have, become far more notice
able than formerly, a greasy substance won
derfully resembling petroleum but without
odor, may be plainly seen. It covers the water
for quite an extended area and all who have
eeen it pronounce It to be oil. Robert S. Hatch
Becured some of It last week and sent it to
Los Anseles for analysis. In the meantime
the Southwestern Oil and Development Com
pany, composed of Tuma enthusiasts, is making
rapid preparations for the sinking of a well.
They are firm in the belief that they have oil
land. Ab almost all of them own land in the
neighborhood, they have made a pool to test
the field. It is said that several enterprising
capitalists of Yuma have signified their will
ingness to do the same, so the amount neces
sary to 6tart things is already in sight. A
brand new rig- of the latest pattern, modern In
every particular, will soon be ordered from
San Francisco and prospects are I splendid for
the early inauguration of operations.?;
The Tejon Oil and Development Com
pany has Incorporated, with the following
directors: John Wolf skill, Henry H. Den
ker, P. W. Cottle, . George Lichtenberger,
A. Jacoby, C. L. Whipple and George
Knarr of Los Angeles. M. A. Macmurdo,
J S. Drury. "William Tyler and B. H.
Bill of Bakersfleld, and has selected the
following officers: John Wolfskin, presi
dent; II. H. Denker, vice president;
George Llchtenberger, treasurer, and
Abraham Jacoby, secretary. The com
pany owns 1160 acres adjoining the Tejon
ranch in Kern County.
There is a well In the Kern River dis
trict that during the month of November
produced a total of sixty carloads ajid Is
pumping 350 barrels per day.
A company in the Sunset district is
operating with money procured by the
sale of stock in the City of Mexico. Colo
rado capital has gone Into the Sunset and
McKittrick for leases.
W. P. Mclntosh of Colorado Springs
will exploit petroleum lands.
There seems to be no question about
the strike on the Edgar Oil Company's
property on 18, 2S-28, in the extreme north
ern limits of the Kern River field. The
drill has gone through over 100 feet of oil
sand, which is said to be rich. This ex
tends the district somewhat in a northern
direction, and land is being secured now
In advance of this property. The exten
sion south of the Kern River is likely to
be proved before the. end of the month.
The Hercules Oil Company, operating In
this section, struck a vein of oil at 200
feet in its first well, but eased it off and
will go deeper In soarch of a more pro
lific sand. The southwestern extension is
being opened, up by the Arizona Western
Oil Company, which Is 1000 feet down and

PROSPECTUS
THIS syndicate Is formed to take over the unsold portion of the Fruit Vale 'Estate, the property of m! Theo Kear
ney, situated ln Fresno County, California, and embracing 5187 acres, for the purpose of planting and develoD-
ing the unplanted portion and selling the whole to another company, say two years hence, which will issue bonds
and ehares to provide for Its purchase.
This property was carefully selected and purchased by Mr. Kearney in 1883, and is pronounced by all who
have Eeen It to be one of the most attractive and valuable country estates in California. The soli is of the class now
known to be of the greatest value for the production of choice raisins and of port, sherry and burgundy wines of
â¢which there remains in the Fresno district but a very limited quantity not already, planted. It is conceded that no
other county in the State can successfully compete with Fresno in these products.
Reference Is made to an accompanying circular for reports upon the property. See pages 31 to 37.
Of the 61S7 acres, 2000 have been used as grain land, 1000 acres are In alfalfa, 900 acres in full bearinff raisin
vineyard and 100 acres in bearing orchard.
A palm avenue, the finest in the State, eleven miles long, with three roadways, beginning at the town of Fres
Â»o. runs through the property.
/ A park ln the center of the estate contains 240 acres and Is handsomely improved. It Is, however reserved
from Bale, as it Is less profitable than the other lands, but it Is to be leased by the syndicate so as to uUUza tu
buildings. ' lze tne
The whole property Is under a thorough system of irrigation, with long established water rights belonging to It-
roads are constructed to every part, every twenty-acre sub-division having a frontage on a road â an important ad'
vantage ln the event that it is ever desired to sell the property ln sub-divisions. Ample buildings for Its needs an>
already erected, and in all other respects the property Is in flrst-class order, over $400,000 having been expended In its
improvement. With an additional expenditure of $400,000 it can in the next three years be brought to earn a net In-
come of from $50 to $150 per acre, or $250,000 to $750,000 annually, depending. upon the seasons and market conditions"
This estimate is conservative. (See circular, pages 37 to 40.)
On account of the depression in the raisin industry following the panic of 1893, largely due to Improper meth
ods in marketing the crop in practice at that time, the raisin acreage of the State has been greatly reduced and as a
result the yearly demand for raisins is now fully equal to the yearly supply. Further, the demand Is rapidly In-
creasing owing to the Introduction of machinery -which Is now successfully used to take the seeds from raisins be"
fore they are offered for sale. "Seeded" raisins are becoming a very popular article of food with cooks and house
keepers throughout the country. /
The California Raisin Growers' Association, which Is In the third year of its successful career, fixes the price of
raisins for the whole crop of the State and assures prosperity to raisin growers.
The California Wine Association offers to make a contract for ten years at a very remunerative figure for the
purchase of all wine grapes we may produce.
It Is proposed to at once plant 4000 acres (of which 2000 acres are already being planted) In raisin and wine
vineyard and ln new California Smyrna fig orchard. . This can be done at an outlay, covering three years, of $300 000
One hundred thousand dollars more Is required to pay off a mortgage and $100,000 for equipment. '
The 6187 acres and the personal property, including about 275,000 raisin curing trays and boxes of the value of
$30,009, 100 head of work animals, with harness, .farming implements, vehicles, 800 tons of hay, 200 tons of barley and
about one million rooted vines for the coming season's planting, etc.. etc., have been taken over by the syndicate at
the gross sum of $S65.O00, or the net sum, deducting the mortgage of $100,000. of $765,000. This is a very low valuation
as eales of wholly unimproved land ln this tract of the came quality have been made at an average of $200 per acre'
(Bee in circular the certificate of the searcher of records, page 34.) The crop of raisins, grapes and fruits gathered hi
1S00 and the outstanding accounts are not included in the purchase. All expenditures since October 1, 1900, not on crorj
account have been assumed by the syndicate; the amount, however, does not exceed $5000. No other liabilities are as
earned except the mortjrage for $100,000. - .
Of the purchase price Mr. Kearney has accepted $700,000 in fully paid shares, thus showing in the strongest imn
oer his faith ln the investment m<lu "
As it Is desired that the syndicate shall conduct its business on a cash basis and hold Its property free frnm

This leaves $725,000 of treasury stock to be Bold if further expenditures are found desirable. A by-law adopted
by the syndicate prohibits the lncunnent of any debts beyond the value of the treasury stock on hand thus guar-
anteeing In a very practical way that the stock issued -will not be assessed. â¢ .Â«*"Â«Â«
. It Is well known In the raisin -district that good vineyards earn $100 per acre annually under present conditions
Jm bonds bearing 5 per cent Interest which are secured on property earning two or three times the interest payable
on the bonds are eagerly souerht for. it can safely be expected that when the time arrives to issue bonds on this prop-
erty it can readily be done on a basis of 5500 per acre because the fixed charge for interest will be only $25 per acre
These bonds will be especially desirable because they will have valuable real estate as a basis of security '

ings of the property above $2a per acre, which, after settinjr aside a percentage to the sinking fund for the redemp-
tion of the bonds, should equal 6 per cent on $5,000,000. will be paid In dividends to the shareholders.

A largre additional Item is the earning* of the 1000 acres of vineyard and orchard already in full bearing which
*m be received while the new vineyards are reaching maturity. No account Is taken of exceptionally prosperous
years when the profits realized amount to half or the whole cost of the property. prosperous
In any possible event the syndicate will own B000 acres of the most valuable vineyard In the State, fully' equip-
ped, all ln bearing and entirely free from debt, at a cost of only $1,265,000. or J253 per acre. If 5 per cent on that sum Is
taken from the earnings and paid to the syndicate shareholders as interest that would amount to only $12.65 per acre
and all that the property will earn above that small sum will be profit " '
No Buch results as outlined above can be secured by the purchase and planting of small tracts by Individuals,
because only financially strong companies, employing the best business and farming ability and operating on a large
scale can hope to succeed ln placing their bonds and shares.

Rich and Poor Alike Suffer From
Catarrh in This Climate.
All observant physicians have noticed
the enormous increase in catarrhal dis-
eases in recent years, and the most liberal
and enlightened have cheerfully given
their approval to the new internal rem-
edy, Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, as the most
successful and by far the safest remedy
for catarrh yet produced.'
One well-known catarrh specialist, as
soon as he had made a thorough test of
this preparation, discarded inhalers
washes and sprays and now depends en-
tirely upon Stuart's Catarrh Tablets in
treating catarrh, whether in the head
throat or stomach.
Dr. Risdell says: "In patients who had
lost the sense of smell entirely, and even
where the hearing has begun to be af-
fected from catarrh, I have had fine re-
sults after only a few weeks' use of Stu-
art's Catarrh Tablets. I can only explain
their action on the theory that the cleans-
ing and antiseptic properties of the tablets
destroy the catarrhal germs wherever
found, because I have found the tablets
equally valuable in catarrh of the throat
and stomach as in nasal catarfh."
Dr. Estabrook says Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets are especially useful in nasal ca:
tarrh and catarrh of the throat, clearing
the membranes of mucus and speedily
overcoming the hawking, coughing and
expectorating.
Any sufferer from catarrh will find Stu-
art's Catarrh Tablets will give immediate
relief, and being in tablet form and pleas-
ant to the taste are convenient and al-
ways ready for use, as they can be car-
ried in the pocket and used at any time
as they contain no poisonous drugs but
only the cleansing antiseptic properties of
eucalyptus bark, guaiacol, blood root and
hydrastin.
All druggists sell the tablets at 60 cents
for complete treatment.

My advice to any woman who won't
take anybody's word and who wants to
find out for herself is to write to Mrs.
Pinkham for evidence that these letters
are genuine. I can answer a few such
letters myself if addressed care of this
paper. HELEN MARVIN.
My Investigation along this line has
proved very entertaining to me, and I
hope the truth about these things will
prove interesting to others, for there
are a grreat many who still think there
is something not quite correct about
these women's letters. ,
I used to laugh about these letters of
Â¦women, but since I have gone carefully
Into the matter I feel rather solemn
about it, for going among these women
has convinced me beyond a doubt that
Mrs. Pinkham is doing women a great
deal of good . with her remedies, and
while I cannot go into the details of
personal experience that the women can
Â¦who have been cured, I have lost no op-
portunity to recommend the medicine
to women I know who needed Just this
kind of help.
Each one of the women told me that
she had written voluntarily to Mrs.
Pinkham and had given permission of
her own free will to print her letter,
and that there was nothing within her
power she would not do to convince
women that Mrs. Pinkham's Medicine
would help their sickness.
It certainly is refreshing to find a
sentiment like this in this sordid world
â¢where everybody's motives are ques-
tioned, and I am frank to say that fully
as I believe in the worth of Mrs. Pink-
ham's remedies I would never have
thought these women whose letters are
printed were having it done solely to
do good.
Naturally these women are enthusi-
astic, and I made up my mind that a
i perfectly well woman who has never
j been seriously ill with any female
| trouble couldn't possibly realize how
! deep is the gratitude of the ones wjiq
j have been through all kinds of misery
J and finally were cured. Why these wo-
men would go miles any day to tell any
sick woman how they were helped.
There's no immodesty whatever in the
story to them. They are doing what
they do and are enthusiastic about It
j wholly because they want to help other
! women.
1 In every case the woman I called
Â¦ upon was perfectly respectable and
j modest, and after I had received an-
i swers to the letters I had sent out and
: made some investigation of the women
' to whom I wrote, 1 was no longer in
j doubt as to their motives for going
I publicly upon record as Indorsing and
; recommending Mrs. Pinkham's Medl-
j cine. Why every one of these women
I looks upon Mrs. Pinkham as the most
| sympathetic woman in the world and
! upon Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
i Compound as the most remarkable
Â¦ medicine ever, compounded. Several of
| them stated plainly to me that they
knew Mrs. Pinkham's Medicine had
I saved their lives, because they had
1 dor.e everything they could, had been
â¢ to the best physicians and were Just
ready to give up when they tried Mrs.
I Pinkham.
I read these advertisements right
along for a year or two to see what
singular details women would write
about themselves, and I concluded it
was not possible that real nice women
would state puch things publicly, so I
started" on an investigation on my own
account. I don't know Just what I ex-
pected to rind; indeed I didn't have any
j definite idea about it. I simply wanted
I to know what the secret was and all
! about it. I selected Mrs. Pinkham's
I Medicine because of the enthusiastic
: letters of the women, and after taking
| down the addresses and names of wo-'
i men to the number of twenty, I wrote
\ to the ones far away and called on
I seven which were within the radius
! where I traveled. The result of my ln-
I vestipation surprised me a good deal,
I and would surprise any one who is
| skeptical about the authenticity of
I these letters from women.
It used to eeem a very curious thing
to me. and I suppose it seems Just as
singular to thousands of other people,
that women will write letters to be
printed in newspapers telling how they
were cured of Illness by Mrs. Pinkham's
Medicine.

City of Rio de . Janeiro arrived
from the Orient via Honolulu yes
terday, t She brought .up 70 cabin
passengers, 150 second cabin pas
sengers and 62 Chinese. She also brought
over 900,000 sold yen" from Japan and $25,
000 Jn American silver. This shipment
represents a value of about $475,000 Ameri
can money and is the largest that has
come from Japan In a long time.
Nearly all the men who came back in
tbe second cabin went away from here on
the German transport Samoa. They were
employed to take care of the horses that
were shipped from here to Taku. and tho
German Government sent ; , : them home
again when their services were no longer

la hard to learn, but when thÂ« Constance
reached port her fantall was shattered
and repairs had to bÂ« made before she
could move around the bay.
When talking about the colllslonyester
day one of the passengers aald: "we were
moving along on our regular course and
at full speed when suddenly another river
boat loomed up on our quarter. For a few
minutes it looked as though she would cut
us In two, and everybody made a rush for
life-preservers. By skillful work, on the
part of both captains the danger was
avoided, but part of our stern wheel was
lost In the shuffle. It was a close call, and
I never want to be in siibb' a scrape
again."
The steam schooner Cleone, which went

Insurance Company at once chartered the

chances are that Captain Miller and the
crew of the Cleone will arrive in San

will get here from Mendocino City. The

AFTER twice narrowly escaping
..destruction . the transport Bel
gian King finally reached port
yesterday. Once she was caught
In the tail end of a typhoon and
the water- tanks burst, flooding the flre
room. For three days the big freight
boat drifted at the mercy of the wind and
waves and then finally when repairs were
made she had to put into Hongkong for
an overhauling.
. From Hongkong the Belgian King went
to Nagasaki and was coaled there. When
five days out from the Japanese port the
coal in the bunkers caught flre and for
three days, that danger. had to be fought.
Finally the fire was put .out and then the
Belgian King came on to San Francisco
without any more mishaps.
When the Belgian King lalled from
Manila she had aboard besides the regular
crew First Lieutenant A. I* Cabanne and
Lieutenant H. J. Parker. Both are from
the Forty-eighth Regiment (colored) and
come here to report to the adjutant gen-,
era! for discharge. Adolpho Rastag and
H. L. Blngham, discharged soldiers, and
M. Anderson, W. C. Johnson and G. L.
Hill, civilian employes, also came over
on the transport. * At Nagasaki Dr.
Albert Coltman. wife and six children,
were taken aboard. Dr. Coltman has spent
sixteen years In China, his headquarters
for the bulk of the time being In Peking.
He is the author of a book called '.'The
Yellow Crime" and cOmes to America to
see It published.
AH the' passengers on the transport
speak calmly of the dangers they have
passed through. Those who came from
Manila ' say that on leaving Manila on
October 14 there was no sign of heavy
weather. Two days later the vessel was
fighting the tail end of a typhoon. Sud
denly the water tanks burst and the fire
room soon had eight feet of water in it.

Robert "W. WIlcox, Delegate-elect to
Congress from Hawaii, arrived on the Rio
Janeiro yesterday and Is registered at the
Occidental. Wilcox may have some
trouble taking his seat in the National
House of Representatives, as a bitter
fight is to be waged on the legality of his
election. The contest will be on purely
technical grounds. It is claimed that the
Territorial act does not Â¦ provide for an
election, and until such provision is made
by the Hawaiian Legislature no Delegate
can be chosen. The act says that there
shall bo a Delegate chosen by the people
according to law, but as this law has not
yet been framed it is claimed that, from
a technical standpoint at least. Wllcox's
election was illegal.
The Republican Central Committee has
declined to take the matter up oillcially.
but a number of prominent Hawaiian citi
zens have Interested themselves In the
matter, and it is understood Georee D.
Gear, who arrived here yesterday, has
been delegated by the opponents of Wll
cox to look after their interests in Wash
ington. Gear is an old Cahfornlan, and
he has the confidence of the business men
of the islands. It is an open secret that
Gear would like the appointment of Cir
cuit Judge, and his mission to Washing
ton will therefore be for a twofold object.
L- A. Thurston, who represented the
islands in Washington when the question
of annexation was first brought up, and
who was also a passenger on the steamer,
said last evening that the technical point
raised against the legality of Wllcox's
election is unquestionably a strong one,
but he had bis doubts if the matter would
be pushed.
WIlcox said he was not worrying on
account of a possible contest. He does
not think the election will be declared il
legal.
"If It Is they will elect me over again,"
he said, "for I am the idol of our native
people.

amendments a substitute offered by Abe
Ruef was adopted providing for the ap
pointment by the chair of a committee

"As to Dr. Lalne's statement regarding
the purchase of the lot. the facts are as
follows: The college had $11,000 on hand,
as stated. When we purchased the -lot
$10,000 of this amount was paid out of the
treasury, as every member of the board of
trustees knows. Five thousand dollars
more was subscribed, as follows: March

Asay, $500: â¢W. F. Southard, $500; Miss
Macnamara, $500: Mrs. Winslow Ander
son, $500; Mrs. Charles Boxton, $150; Rob
ert Davis, $900; Winslow Anderson, $1450.
"Hence when Dr. Laine says he signed
no note for me. and that I loaned no
money to the college, he tells a deliberate
untruth, as the note is still In existence,
marked paid and In the possession of the
college. For years Dr. Laine has endeav
ored to estrange the friendship which ex
isted between Dr. Hodghead and myself,
and when he states that I Â« told him
'that I could' have- Dr. Hodghead put In

'that I had taken the Pacific Medical

he states' a "deliberate falsehood.

considerable discussion. The general
trend of the debate was toward limiting
the powers of the county boards in regard
to their issuance. J. B. McChesney advo
cated the drafting of an amendment that
would settle the question, but this was
defeated for the reason that the commis
sion thought there was sufficient legisla
tion over school laws under way. and the
addition of such an amendment would
prove detrimental to the plans already on
foot. The matter was disposed of by
adopting the resolution of W. D. Kings
bury. which was in favor of leaving the
powers of the county boards as they were.
The amendment submitted to the com
mission regarding text books and which
caused a lively discussion read as follows:
The State Board of Education, in compiling
rr causing to be compiled text books for use
In the common Echools of the State, may make
use of and adopt, with or without change, all
or any part of any text book at the time ex
isting-; and If such existing text book, or any
Mirt thereof desired to be so usf>d by said
LrÂ«.rd. shall at the time be copyrighted, and
laid, board cannot lawfully make such uze of
taid text book, or part thereof, without con
sent of the owner of the copyright, then said
t.oerd may purchase from the owner the light
to make such use of 6uch text book, or part
thereof, for such price and upon such terms
aa said board fhall deem reasonable; provided,
that in the Judgment of said board such pur
chase will secure for use In the common 6cnools
of the State a satisfactory text .book, at a cost
less than would be required to compile, with
out euch purchase, a text book of equal merit.
State Superintendent Kirk in discussing
the question said:
"If the State Board has the authority
to compile there would be little need for
W. D. Kinprsbury stated that the passage
of some of the amendments as they now
read would harm the San Francisco teach
ers, while others would injure the coun
try teachers. To prevent this he intro
duced a resolution calling for the striking
out of certain phrases and the adding of
others, which was adopted.
The afternoon session was spent in mak
ing minor changes in the phraseology of
the various proposed amendments and the
passage of the act regarding the forma
tion of union school districts, which was
done without discussion.
An expert only should select text books,
and the average Board of Education docs
not contain any experts. They have not
been trained for such work, consequently
are not capable."
The report of the sub-committee was
adopted for immediate legislation.
J. W. Linscott introduced a resolution,
which was also adopted, calling for a con
ference of members of the State Board of
Education and the sub-committee for the
purpose of submitting a constitutional
amendment providing for the "adoption of
a series of text books, to be purchased in
open market." This settled the text book
qupstion, and the meeting adjourned until
1:30.
"It seems to me."- said Mr. Wheeler,
"that we have overlooked the interests of
the children. The constitution was framed
with the !dea of furthering their Interests,
and although I favor the proposed amend
ment submitted by the commission. I be
lieve we should do what we can under the
present law. Reputable business houses
are not very anxious to deal with the
State Board of Education owing to the
preponderance of red tape. Through some
technicality they .save been unable to se
cure the payment of a small bill due them.
The present plan of securing text books
is" very poor and .the prices are bad. This
State spent 13500 to help defray the ex
penses of compiling a history. We were
unable to use the book, for it contained
but .little history. , . â
It was at this point that President
Wheeler, who had been a silent but inter
ested spectator during the entire morning,
arose and save his opinion.
P. M. Fisher of Oakland and Professor
Cubberly also favored a change in the
constitution.
"We are helpless." said Professor Childs.
"without a constitutional amendment, and
after a thorough study of the question I
am of the opinion we should make a move
toward securing such."
J. W. McClymonds said It was Impossi
ble make a very successful choice of
text books under the present law. He fa
vored legislative enactment by which a
better class of text books could be se
cured.

what wo can do under the existing law.
I am of the opinion that the law now in
force does not prevent the choice of text

Charles L. Wcller appeared.for the peo
ple at the inquest and General E. S. Salo
mon for Dr. Bohm and Mrs. Schmidt.
Dr. O'Donneil was not represented by
counsel.
The most important witness for thÂ«
prosecution wa3 Mias Etta Crumley of 311
Golden Gate avenue, a cousin of the dead
woman. Miss Crumley testified that she
had gone to Dr. O'Donnell's office several
times with Mrs. Ciddings. Mrs. Giddinga
having confessed to her the purpose of
those visits. After that the witness ac
companied her couain to the office of Dr.
Bohm, at S*4 Golden Gate avenue, to make
arrangements for further treatment.
Dr. O'Donnell took the stand and sworo
that he v/as a graduate of the Kentucky
School of Medicine. He said that he saw
Mrs. Giddings for the first time two
months ago, when she called at hia office
and told him that she had performed an
operation on herself. He found that thero
Â¦was nothing the matter and gave her a
tonic for her nerves. She called again on
Thursday of last week for an examina
tion, with a similar result. That was the
last he saw of her. he said, and he did not
advise her to go to Dr. Bohm or any other
physician.
A peculiarity of the case Is the disap
pearance of William Spauldin*. the host

Crumley going into Dr. Bohm's office, and
of Mrs. Conway, the landlady of the lodg

"SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 8, 1900.
"To the Editor of The Callâ Sir: Up to
this time I have taken no public part In
the discussion regarding the College of
Physicians and Surgeons, partly because
I believed that the intelligent public
would easily see through the thin veil of
jealousy, failure, meanness and grail
which have prompted the dishonorable
methods pursued by the disgruntled mai
contents and partly because all false
statements had been refuted by Dr. An
derson: but since Dr. J. R. Lalne has
taken it upon himself to reflect upon me
more than once in his assertions I pro
pose that the public shall understand a
little at least/as, to who I am and what
Dr. Lalne is. "I am not so dull nor.is Dr.
Lalne so profound but .that more than
once have I easily read - his shallow
schemes and his little games
before he maae a second move.
"Who ever may hold over my head the
sword of Damocles, It is very true that
Dr. J. It. Laine neither Is nor ever has
been my Dionyslus. Had he been he
might still be president of the College of
Physicians ana Surgeons. It is true that
I have done some editorial work for the
Pacific Medical Journal and In that con
nection the only regret I nourish Is that
I have been charged: with writing a cer
tain editorial which. Dr. Laine himself,
wrote and had not the courage to sign.
"The accompanying letter from Dr.
Winslow Anderson Is sufficient answer to
Dr. Lalne's base, slanderous and false
Intimations regarding deficits . in the ac
counts of the Pacirtc Medical Journal.
Dr. Anderson never bought nor In any
other manner acquired from me all or. any
part of the Paciric Medical Journal. I
sold a half Interest to T. P. Woodward
of the firm of \V. A. Woodward & Co.
This half interest Dr. Anderson pur
chased. My remaining half Interest I
Bold to Dr. W. F. McXutt a short time be
fore I left for Europe, and at that time
all of my financial interest in the Pacific
Medical Journal ceased.
"If Dr. Laine wishes to inject person
alities Into this discussion I would have
him understand that his record Is not so
clear that he needs to court investigation.
He cringes to superiors and loves only
slaves, therefore ne does not love me.
"I say that Dr. Lalne did sign a note as
president of the college in favor of Dr.
Winslow Anderson for the sum of $1450.
That rote has been redeemed and is In
possession of the college, and the records
of the, college will show that he signed
such note on March 8, 1S99. Those records
are in my office and can be. seen by any one.
Again, Dr. Laine in my presence prom
ised to advance an equal amount of money
with Dr.- Anderson for the purchase of
land on which to erect a college building,
and this promise he never kept. It has al
ways been true that the very men who
are endeavoring now to Injure the college
are the men who were always ready to talk
and boss, but never ready to advance one
cent. They fought and lost. With bom
bastic dignity and pompous indignation
they resigned; then they whimper and cry
'.ike spoiled babies for a lost toy. . Those
men need nursing bottles and diapers yet.
"It seems rather strange that if I were
considered dishonest that I was elected,
without my own solicitation, a member
of the faculty of the College of-Physi
cians and Surgeons and later a member
of the, board of trustees, of whicji Dr.
Laine was presidert, which election must
be by ballot and must be unanimous. If
Dr. Laine did not vote for me I am glad
of It. I think my reputation in this com
munity for honesty is certainly equal. to
that of Dr. J. R. I.aine's. I owe no man
anything. I have accounted for every
cent of money belonging to this corpora
tion that has been placed In my keeping.
This is more than Dr. Laine has done.
"Among Dr. Laine'a feeble efforts in
various enterprises he has persistently at
tempted to make trouble between Dr. An
derson and myself. I have stood with Dr.
Anderson because -I believe more In the
man. I opposed Dr. Laine. I am glad of
it and proud of it. He may continue to
truckle to his superiors and lash into sub
mission those he presumes to control, but
he cannot vent his spleen nor pour his
venom upon me without receiving in re
turn equally as much as he gives.
"D. A. HODGHEAD"
It might have been expected that Dr.
Winslow Anderson would not lose an op
portunity toVreply to the very serious al
i legations made against his personal and
professional character by Dr.. Laine. Dr.
Anderson has sent to The Call a com
munication in which he arraigns Dr. Lalne
on a series of accusations ranging in gen
uine interest from falsehood to grog and
pipe dreams. Dr. Anderson's communica
tion la as follows:
Anderson Believes Lalne Uses Grog
or a Pipe.

Patsy Freeman, an American rider,

and the balance of the "layers" were al
most as well ahead on the afternoon's
play.
For some reason everybody and every
body's friend seemed to think Gold Or, the
big sprinter from the stable of Brown &
Liger. unbeatable for the first event, a
five and a half furlong scramble. Gibral
tar was in. but this fact seemed to cut no
figure. Gold Or had his price hammered
down to 9 to 10, with the smart ones all
"down." When a start was finally ac
complished the favorite seemed tangled
up, permitting Abba L. and Frank Bell to
sneak away in front. * Into the stretch
Gibraltar had taken command, but he
suddenly became stricken with a feeling
of ennui. Then O'Connor came rushing
along en the 20 to 1 shot May Gertrude,
and with only two or three pounds and a
gulp left beat Gold Or a length In 1:07.
The latter horse downed a big field over
the same distance only a few days before
with ten pounds more In the saddle In
lwA which did not give the race a pol
ished look. As a result the judges called
for the sheets, and for the time being the
stable of Brown & Licer and Jockey
Wtdderstrand stand suspended, pending
further- investigation.
Anothr surprise was In store for the
crowd. Walter Jennings' crack two-year
cld Canmore, carrying Mounce and 9S
pounds In the saddle, was backed for all
colors of coin to take the Emeryville
handicap at a mile and failed. His rider
was unfortunate in getting away from tho
post none too quickly and had to take
the "overland", route from start to finish.
As a natural sequence Dominlck with the
leg up on the new scholar,' Tayon a 105

itiesâa mile and a furlong, run. In one

AFTER nursing the balls along the
rail Â¦ and executing 1 a few clever
around-the- world shots, the book
makers finally got the ivories
nicely nestled and ran the game
out on the talent at Oakland yesterday.
There was a huge matinee crowd present,
ami the history of Its mishaps and mis
takes v.-ould take volumes to tell. To be
brief, six natty looking favorites were
hypnotized and the ring retired with the
coin. George Rose modestly admitted to
winning J0OC. Fred Cook, the St. Louis
penciler, laid away $;MX>O f and Mitchell &
Driscoll wero close up with $1000. Johnny
Coleman was Induced to practically hold
out Specitic, thus quitting $2200 to the
good. Down on the "dead line" Tony
Cook of Cook & Hoffman carted away
$2000, and "Conductor" McManus, a few
doors above, rang up J2500. "Bill" Jack

All matters pertaining to thei construc
tion of the new boat will be open at all
times to any one interested. In order to
build the new boat. Mr. Lawley will have
to sublet one" of his Government contracts,
and in case he Is unable to do so, the boat
will be built by the Fore River Engine
Company of Quincy Point.
BOSTON, Dec. S.-After a "conference
with Boston designers, Boston builders
and a number of representative Boston
yachtsmen, Thomas W. Lawson, the well
known financier and horse fancier of this
city, announced to-night that he would
personally stand the expense of building
another yacht to compete for the honor of
defending the America's cup against Sir
Thomas Upton's Shamrock II.
The new yacht, according to Mr. Law
son, will be designed by B. B. Crownln
shield of this city, who has already had
much success with smaller boats, while
George Lawley of South Boston, the
builder of the former cup defenders Puri
tan and Mayflower and the outfitter of
still another, the Volunteer, will probably
construct the new boat. It is expected
that Captain Xat Watson, one of the best
skippers in the East, will act as galling
master, and Mr. Lawson also states that
an opportunity will be given to a number
of Corinthian yachtsmen to assist in
working the boat as part of her crew.

SENT : FREE-TO MEN!~
A Most. Remarkable Remedy, That
Quickly Restores Lost Vigor
to Men.
A Free Trial Package Sent by Mall
to All Who Write. ;
Free trial packages of a mest remarka-
ble remedy are being mailed to all who
will write the State Medical Institute.
They cured so many men 'vho had bat-
tled for years against the mental and
physical suffering of lost manhood that
the Institute .has j decided to distribute
free trial packages to all who write. It
is a home treatment, and all men who
suffer trom any. form of sexual weakness
resulting from youthful folly, premature
loss of strength and memory, weak lack,
varicocele or emaciation of parts can now
cure themselves at home.
The remedy has a peculiarly grateful
effect of warmth and seems to act direct
to the desired location, giving strength
and development just where it is needed.
It cures all the ills and troubles .hat come
from years of misuse of the natural func-
tions and has been an absolute success in
all cases. A request to the State Medical
Institute. 828 Elektron building. Fort
Wayne, Ind.. stating that you desire one
of their free trial packages, will be com-
plied with promptly. The Institute is de-
sirous of reaching that grea: class of men
who are unable to leave home to be treat-
ed, and the free. sample wÂ«U enable them
to see how easy It is to be cured of sex-
ual weakness when the "proper remedies
are employed. The Institute makes no re-
strictions. Any man who writes will -bo
sent a free sample, carefully sealed in a
plain package, so that Its recipient need
have no fear of embarrassment or public-
ity. Readers are requested to writs with*,
out delay.

The Pyramid Pile Cure Is sold by drug-
plsts at fifty cents for complete treat-
ment and as It contains no opiate or other
poisonous drugs may be used with entire
safety.
ICo one need suffer from piles in any
form, who will give this excellent prepar-
fctlon a trial
Mrs. Hinkley of Indianapolis was told
by her physician that nothing' but a surgi-
cal operation costing between seven and
eight hundred dollars could cure her, as
the had suffered fifteen years, yet even
la such a cose the Pyramid Pile Cure ac-
complished a complete cure. She says: "I
knew an operation would be death to me
end tried the Pyramid with very little
hope, bo Jt is not to be wondered at that
I am so enthusiastic in Its praise."
Mrs. X). E. Reed of Albany says: "I
would not take S500 and be placed back
where I was before I used the Pyramid
Pile Cure; I suffered for years and it Is
new eighteen months clnee I used it and
not the slightest trace of the trouble has
returned."
"I was a sufferer from pile* for years
until a brother salesman told me about
the Pyramid Pile Cure. It has entirely
cured rne and I cheerfully recommend it."
A gent!* man living in Cleveland relates
Us experience by saying: "If affords me
unusual pleasure to add my Indorsement
to what I consider a really wonderful pile
cure. -"Â¦"â¢'
The Pyramid Pile Cureallaysthe inflam-
mation and intolerable itching, reduces
the tumors, and by Us astringent prop-
erties causes the enlarged blood vessels
to contract to a healthy condition.
Hr.ndreds of people who had almost de-
cided to undergo an operation, bellevlnfj
r.othiiur else would cure them, have been
astonished to f.nd that a fifty-cent box of
the Pyramid was far safer, better and
more effective than an operation could
possibly be.
The Pyramid Pile Cure has been apleas-
ar.t surprise to thousands of sufferers, be-
cause of the Instant relief It gives and
the prompt cure which follows Its regular
ufc. and this Is done without the use of
opiates, cocaine, narcotics or poisons of
any kind, as careful analysis shows the
Pyramid Pile Cure to be wholly free
from any Injurious drug whatever.

ALAMEDA, Dec 8.â State sanitariums
for the care of consumptives are favored
by the Board of Health of this city, and
at a regular meeting of that body held
last ni^ht a resolution^urglngr legislative
action to provide fcr the establishing and
maintenance, of such institutions was
unanimously adopted. Copies of it will
be sent to the health officials of the vari
ous cities throughout California, and It Is
planned in this way to arouse Interest in
the movement and to strengthen by co
operation the- efforts that are expected to
be made by the State Board of Health to
induce the next Legislature to establish
hospitals for tuberculosis patients.
"Too much attention cannot be given to
the prevention of and to precautions
against tuberculosis," said Dr. W. O
Smith, the framer of the resolution. "It is
now acknowledged by all medical authori
ties that the disease is .contagious. In
New , York . City alone two-thirds of the
deaths from contagious diseases are due
to consumption, and one-sixth of the an
nual number of deaths in the world is due
to the same cause. Its fearful ravages
among human beings are creating alarm
In New York. Liverpool and Germany
provisions are being made for the isolation
and care of consumptives at the Govern
ment's expense. The time is fast coming
when every State will : take greater pre
cautions, Rgainst: the dread disease.
Crowds of . consumptives are headed our
way and thousands are already among 1 us
As all measures to - keep them out- have
failed, it behooves us as a matter of self
protection to look after them when' they
are here." ,

Establishing of Public
Sanitariums.

It was no use. One, then another, even
at last the slim and epirituelle Parisian,
succumbed to the charms of the fascin

knows If dawn had not come what more
would have happened; but those arriving
early on Saturoay morning could tell a

WELL, no one can say that our
Model Doll Show has not been
a splendid success this year,"
said the last Doctor's Daugh
ter In the Palace Hotel last
night, and she sighed a sigh of deep sat
isfaction as she carefully locked the Ma
ple Room door on the gorgeously gowned
matrons and maids posing there In stiff
elegance.
"Now, they are safe till the morning,"
she said to herself, and with a "Good
night, dollies!" and a hope for the mor
row's good fortune, went to her well
earned rest. .
And then occurred, on the other eldÂ© of
that locked door, the famous row, the
particulars of which later leaked out â we
are not permitted to say howâ and which
threatened the very foundations of doll
l dom and the entire Saturday programme
of the Model Doll Show.
" 'No one can say that the show has not
been a success'.' What does she call a suc
cess! Not a man about the place! Queer
Ideas of a success, I say."
It was a tall, svelte creature, rigged up
a la Bernhardt all in clinging blacks, who
was speaking, and she Irritably fingered
her "honorable mention" as she descended
gracefully from her smilax-garlanded
perch.
"Not a man about the place, but those
' scrubby little Eskimos in the other room,
and an unspeakable little two-dollar nig
Â¦ ger on the bargain table!" she repeated.
"Don't take on so, dear; it can't make
very much difference to you," cooed a vis
ion in spangles and moonlit gauze. "I
don't care whether there's a man about
the place or no. They have me screwed
up into this 'new figure,' as they call it,
till I can't breathe.

This trip has been under consideration
for some time by the astronomers of the
Lick Observatory. It will be for the pur
pose of studying the movement of stars
In the line of <?ight by the use of the Mills
tspectrograph. This work will be of great
Importance, for It deals with the supreme
problem to astronomers â the true consti
tution of the universe.
About three-fourths of the sky has al
ready been studied by the spectrograph.
By going south of the equator the rest of
the sky may be measured. Observers will
be stationed somewhere either in Austra

will be necessary to complete the work.
Dr. W. W. Campbell, acting director of
the observatory, will at once begin prepa
rations for the expedition.
Mr. Mills has been one of California's

111S Broadway. Dec 8.
All thÂ© officers of the Alameda County
government met this morning in the
Supervisors* room to discuss matters af
fecting them or likely to affect them at
the next session of the State Legislature.
Supervisor W.' H. Church was chosen
chairman and County Clerk Frank C.
Jordan secretary of the meeting.
The most important matter discussed
was as to whether Aiameda County
should be raised from the present status
as a third-class county to that of a sec
ond-class county, the late census entitling;
the county to go up a peg if so desired.
It was the unanimous opinion of the of
ficials that the county's position should
not be changed. To change would mean,
the officials agreed, a vast amount of
labor and expense which was not worth
the trouble, aa there would be no sub
stantial benefit to the people of the
county or Its officials. The number of
salaried employes would be doubled and
the additional expense would have to b<*
borne by thÂ© taxpayers. There would
be a likelihood of conflict with Los An
teles, the only second-class county in the
tate at present. What litigation would
suit Alameda County would probably not
be agreeable to Los Angeles County, and
there would be constant tinkering In order
to adjust difference*, which might take
years.
To sum up all the talk, the consensus of
opinion was that the move would be a
danarerous one to undertake.
Disapproval having been stamped upon
a second-class county the officials took
up the suggestion that a joint meeting be
held with the Alameda County legislative
delegation to discuss matters of need of
the various county offices. It is under
stood that County Clerk Jordan wants to
be relieved of the burden of paying for
the expense of registration and that the
other officials have certain favors they
want granted. It was finally agreed that
the secretary arrange for a meeting with
the Alameda County Senators and As
semblymen on either Tuesday or Wâ¢daw
day of next week.

prettiest comic operas ever written, has
only been produced once In this cityâ in

it is the piece In which the Boston Lyric

New Orleans is about to move her
colossal statue of Henry Clay. There
was no city In the Union where the great
Kentuckian was more worshiped than In
New Orleans, and his statue has been
the ga.thering point for many a memor
able meeting. It was at its bane that in
March, 1891, the mob collected to de
nounce the murder of the Chief of Police,
which finally In a paroxysm of frenzy
broke Into the Jail and lynched eleven
prisoners. New Orleans has now grown
to such an extent that the. statue must
be moved to give rom to traffic, and It
will be placed beside the statue of Benja
min Franklin In Lafayette Square. â Chi

In the cbove list of operas it will be
r.oted that the only opera still unheard
in America. iin<\ Ftill only to be heard in

f-ir.pcr" and the "Kinp" itfielf, has been
obtained, but with Wasner's death the
possibility of hearing "Parsifal" outside
of Bayreuth vanished for the lifetime of
( "cslma Wacner. The lady still retains the
rights and announces her determination
of adhering to the programme.
Echoes of opera still linear in the air,
rnd one rumor therewith connected, which
H^ms to be mere than commonly well
founded, will be- of much interest here.
It is understood on hij^h authority that
Mr. Grau has sut the seal upon his lmpre-
Farial approval upon a particular affec
tion of ours of San Francisco, the popu
lar barytone of the late grand opera sea-
Fon at the Tivoli. Salassa. The rumor has
It that the finger is engaged to do the
lapo in Verdi's "Otello" next vear, and
that be was heard by Mr. Grau on the
occasion of the opera's last hearing at
thp Tivoli.
Fritzi Scheff. who was the bright partic
ular star of one of the Tivoli box par
ties indulged in by the Grau people, tells
<.f Planron's warm admiration for Salas
sa's Tonio. On the "Pagllacci" night
eleven only of the Grau stars were ap
plauding our favorite barytone, the ladles
with unploved hands the better to ex
jirees their appreciation.
More opera. JProm Mme. Gadski I have
Jt that another late favorite at the Tivoli.
Frances Graham, is singing with marked
fuccpes in the Metropolitan English Opera
Company, now In St. Louis and also un
der the Grau management.
Yet one more operatic item and I have
done. CollamarirJ and Russo, now with
the Boston Lyric Opera Company in Los
Angeles, will make their reappearance in
Han Francisco next week at the Alhambra
Theater. x
First in order of the concerts of the
Â¦wec-k was that of the Loyal Rebekah
IxxJpe, at Â¦which little Paloma. Schramm
made her last appearance In the city. It
v.as the little pianist's first appearance
la concert with other musicians, and she
played with all her usual charm and
prace. Paloma leaves San Francisco this
wc-ek for the East, and will concertlze on
bet V&T, and then if things happen ac
cording to the Mttle girl's strong desire
and hope America will know her no more
for seven years, during which time she

programme was given by the clever Pas
more children, Miss Beulah George, Miss
Tyneletta Geery and H. B. Pasmqre at
Century Hall. The little Pasmores', who
play only trios for piano, violin and cello,
and those entirely from memory, are dis
tinctly clever and play their respective in-
Ftrumcnts in thoroughly workmanlike
faÂ«hlor.. Miss Geery has a pleasing voice,
fair execution and gave the song cycle of
Von Flelita and her .other numbers in
sympathetic fashion. Miss George gave
a graceful reading of the Haydn aria,
"With Verdure Clad," and three other
ponps by Bishop-Bedford Nevin and Well.

THE following- letter will be consld- j
ered by the State Harbor Com
mission at Its regular meeting to
morrow:
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 5, 1900.
Hon. Paris Kllburn, president Harbor Com
missioners, Union ferry depot, cityâ Dear Sir:
We notice in the Evening Tribune of Oakland
November 24 an Interview with Congressman
Metcalf, the gist of which is that the harbor
facilities of San Francisco are inadequate to
accommodate the Increased shipping due to the
enlarged trade with our new possessions in the
Hawaiian and Philippine Islands, and that the
harbor of Oakland will be deepened, new
wharves built, etc., for the purpose of meet
ing such demands.
We have seen similar interviews published
with United States Senator Perkins and are
constantly hearing complaints that the wharf
age facilities are not sufficient in San Fran
cIpco at the present time. The four ne 4 w .
wharves which are being constructed by your
board between Lombard and Union streets will
Increase the wharfagre space to a considerable
extent, but should not plans be arraneed for
still further accommodations?

At the present time the Commissioners
are doing all fn their power to increase
the harbor facilities. The new wharves
mentioned in the letter are contracted for,
and as soon as Congress grants permis
sion every wharf from the sea wall to the
Mail /dock will be extended from 150 to 250
feet This will make a big increase in the
dock room ana may relieve the conges
tion. : v

Dr. W. S. Rice, the Well Known Au-
thority, Sends a Trial of His
Famous Method Free to AH.
Out of the chaos of old-time failure comes a
new and startling cure for rupture. Dr. W. S.
ltlce, 418 N. Main st., Adams, N. T., has In-
vented a method that cures without pain, dan-

ger, operation or an hour's loss of time from
the day's work. To avoid all questions of doubt'
he sends free to every sufferer a free trial of
his method and there can be no earthly reason
why any one, rich or poor, should not avail
i themselves of this generous offer. As an . inâ
j stance of this remarkable method, the cure of
! Chas. Lange, Morrison, 111.. Is a welcome piece
of Intelligence.
Mr. Lanse is a well preserved old gentleman,
72 years of age, ; and for eighteen years had a
bad double rupture which no treatment could
cope with. After a short use of the Rice
method the left rupture healed entirely and the
I right was almost closed in a few weeks. To-
day he is as sound as a dollar, wears no truss
or other support and his cure is only one of
hundreds of similar cases reported by those
who use the Rice method. Send for this free
trial. Don't be backward. .It will surprise you
with itÂ« wonderful power to heal. And if you
know of other runtured people ask them to
write or write for them. Do not fail to write
at once:-do so to-Oay.

no .will was found. It, Is known that the

him some time prior to his demise. There

Dr. Vandye said: "The idea that there
was any misunderstanding at the meeting
of the committee at Washington Isj an
absolute mistake. The committe was ap
pointed, first of all. to get light from the
church at large on the subject of the
amendment of the Presbyterian doctrine
and to suggest the best mode by which
such amendment could be accomplished.
The committeemen unanimously found it
beyond the shadow of a doubt that an
overwhelming majority of the church was,
in favor of some such amendment. .- They
were united also in their Judgment that
the church did not desire to supplant or
set aside the Washington conference, but
only to modify in some way some of Us
statements, and possibly to do this by
the. addition of a briefer statement con
talninp those doctrines which are essen
tial and vital to our system of faith. The
committee, not being altogether idiotic,
never imagined that work so important
could be done In three days or in a week
or in a month. The first task -was to find
the best line along which to move in
meeting the desire of the church for
amendment, for submission to the assem
bly to the church; This is a work of Im
mense importance and cannot be done
well unless it can be done slowly. The
committee needs time and proposes to
take it. All their meetings thus far have
been characterized by a spirit of harmony
and fraternal confidence. There is no pos
sible danger, that I can see of a split In
: the Presbyterian church. Even If the
work of a revision should be delayed for
months or years it is sure to come be
cause the church demands it."
"The committee will meet in this city
on February 12 next to finally prepare Its
statement to- the General Assembly in
PRINCETON, N. J., Dec. 8.â The Rev.
Dr. Henry Vandye, member of the com
mittee on revision of the Presbyterian
creed, made a statement to-day In which
he said that the revision must surely
come.
"&. It was therefore unanimously agreed
by the committee to recommend to the
General Assembly that some revision or
change be maSe in our confessional state
ments. Substantial but not final agree
ment was reached as to the method of
preparing changes embodying both re
vision and : supplemental statement; but
the determining of the whole matter was
deterred to a subsequent meeting.
"4. The returns also indicate a desire
on the part of many presbyteries for
some revision of the present confession.
"3. The returns also Indicate that a
large plurality desire that changes should
be made by some new statement of pres
ent doctrines.
"2. Tho returns indicate plainly that no
change is desired which would in any
way impair the integrity of the system
of doctrine contained In the confession of
faith.
"1." That the returns plainly indicate
that the church desires some changes in
its credal statement.
The committee finds on examination of
the returns from the presbyteries the fol
lowing facts:
WASHINGTON. Dec. 8.â After two
hours' deliberation to-day, the Presby
terian committee concluded Its discussion
of the "revision of the Westminster Con
fession of Faith and adjourned.
Action Taken by the Pres
byterian Committee at
Washington.
RECOMMENDS
REVISION OF CREED
Judge Shinn placed no limit upon the
arguments and, as four lawyers will argue
for each side, it Is likely that the case will
not reach the Jury before the first of next
week. v
Continuing, he said the jurymen must
determine for themselves whether the dec
larations presented by the prosecution as
the dying words of Mrs. Castle were real
ly her deathbed statement, and whether
the wounded woman knew clearly what
she was doing.
V. P. Mooney of Eldorado, opening for
the defense, attacked Olin Castle for stim
ulating JeaJousy between the two women,
and took occasion to say that Mrs. Castle
was better off In her grave than living
with such a man as he had shown himself
to be. -
Castle left the courtroom while Mooney
was closing for the prisoner.
With each hour since she left the stand
yesterday the prisoner had gained
strength and every movement she made
to-day depicted the feelings she felt â joy
over the belief that she would soon be
free. She pinned a rose on her dress be
fore she left her cell and talked brightly
with the jailer on the way to the court
room. She listened with rapt attention to
the lawyers as they argued earnestly for
one side or the other, but the strained
look, the red eyes and pale countenance
bo noticeable during the weary hours of
testimony-taking were missing. The
knowledge that she would soon know her
fate seemed to change her whole being;
instead of an expected collapse, the ap
proach of the end stimulated her to great
er effort.
Judge Shlnn's instructions to the Jury
rather favored the defendant than not.
He told the Jury that a verdict could be
rendered on any count from first degree
murder to fourth degree manslaughter. If
the defendant believed she was in danger
of being killed by Clara Wiley-Castle,
having ilrst been attacked by her, Bhe had
the right to take steps to save her own
life, even the taking of life.
ELDORADO, Kana., ! Dec 8.â Smiling
and confident, Jessie Morrison to-day sat
through three hours of pleading, the last
stage but one In her trial for the murder
of Mrs. Castle.
Accused Woman Smiling
and Confident in the

Many class and other publications are
discussing the report of the Chief ot the
Division of Mining and Mineral Be
sources of the United States Geological
Survey. In some quarters the value of all
the minerals put out last year, which waÂ»
5976,008,946, la used as an argument In
favor of the establishment of a Depart
ment of Mines and Mining, upon the rea
sonable basis that the mlnins Industry
has assumed such great size aa to entitle
it to that consideration. It is pointed out
that the production from 1890 to 1S33 has
exceeded $500,000,000 every year but two,
the panic years of 1893 and 1394. Th<*
average yearly production from 1390 to
1S33, Inclusive, was JGIS.286,510. The pro
duction In 1899 was 5357,722,428, or ES per
cent in excess of the average production
of the preceding nine years. The relative
order of Increase In values of leading
products waa as follows: Pig Iron, coal,
copper and crude petroleum. The figure*
concerning petroleum are misleading In
one respect. The Increase was due to
higher prices, and not to the larger qTian*
tlty produced. The advance in amount
was only 1,700.000 barrels, or less than \
per cent, while the figures of value Indi
cate an increase of *o per cent above tnÂ»
preceding year, or J20.KW.OOO advance. An
Industry that grows an average of
$357,722,133 in a year surety deserve* at
tention from the Government for ltd
fostering.
The total value of the metallic products
In 1S99 was $527,213,081, against $343,400^55
In 1S9S, an Increase of $153,817,129. or H
per cent. The total value of the coo.
metallic products Increased J34.371.Q07, or
27 per cent, from $353,419,765 in 1S33 to
$447,790,562 In 1839. In every year since 1SS1
to 1S93, Inclusive, the value of the non
metalUc products haj exceeded thos* of
the metallic products. In 1SSO, however, tha
metallic products were worth, $18,300,000
more than the non-metallic products. la
li90 the metallic products exceeded those
of the non-metallic products by
$79,500,000. In IaOS the metallic products
were less than the non-metallic products
by $10,000,000, so that there has been a
change of nearly $90,000,000 in tha relative
values as between 1S9S and 1S39.

The Financier says: The upward trend In
the cash reserves of the clearing-house banks
received a eudden check last week through re
newed demands made by the South and West
for funds and steady absorptions by the treas
ury. Both these factors were in evidence early
in the week and estimates of actual losses sus
tained by the banks ran as high as r7.000.000.
ThÂ» statement shows a falling off in caeh of
something over JS.OOO.OOO. and as reserve re
quirements against deposits were not materially
leetened the surplus woÂ« cut In two, standing
at *5,701.125, as againet J10.S65.675 for the pre
vious week. The loaa Item shows an Increase
of JLW4.4O9, which is moderate, after the
eleven million dollar expansion noted a week
ago. Deposits have decreased only $3,366,200.
! As a matter cf fact the lossts In cash are
I shown to have been sustained by one large
Institution, the changes in whose deposits
also account for the total shrinkage In that
Item. It follows that so far as the standing
of the remaining banks is concerned they are
at least as strong In jeterves as they were a
week ago. The continued drain on New York
has had the effect of hardening money rates
and aa the January dividend season is not far
distant the general opinion Is that firm rates
are to be expected over thÂ« end of the year.
I The shipments of heavy sums westward at
! this cea&cn are abnormal, but the movement is
i due to continued heavy business. It is signifi
cant, however, that lu anticipation of higher
rates hero interior banks with large reserves
are sending money to this center to be loaned
and before the first of thÂ« year It is anticipated
that large emounta will be placed. The treas
ury will absorb more money than It pays out
for some time if curnsut calculations are cor
rect, and ac Alaakan gold shipments have faJ
len off the extra supply if needed hero will
have to be attracted by means of lntereÂ«t
rates. There Is nothing to Indicate that thÂ«
loan total will be contracted. The circulation
Item la decreasing slowly, the loss for the
current week having been $62,109.
shown by the prices of the. securities. The
favorites la the trade during- the coining year
are awaited to form a basis tor more definite
conclusions. ThÂ« profits of- manufacture at
last year's level of prices. It is proved, were
so great aa to invite the bringing Into activity
of a large aggregate of productive forces,
which resulted In an overproduction and neces
sitated heavy concessions to work c2 the sur
plus. The lower price level has driven smaller
productive forces Into retirement agUn. The
future value of the securities of the great
combinations depends on whether they can keep
prtcee at a low enough level to deter the
Bmailer eriterprlees frÂ°2Â» competitive produc
tion and still earn dividends on their large
capital. Money rates have been higher during
the week, but the money m&rket outlook has
j net prevented the continuance of strong points
in the market, especially la the lower priced
railroad FtockE.
The business in bonds on several days dur
ing the week has risen above the level of the
dealings In the active ctock market after elec
tion, but has at no time reached the high level
cf the January. 1SW. period. The buying wu
more or less speculative and waa especially
i directed to contingent Interest bonds and junior
im ucs. Gilt-edge and high-grade, bonds are
! quiet.

The market closts very quiet at the follow
ing quotations:
"Our last circular was dated November 7.
since which date all markets have experienced
a sharp decline. Brazils In New Tork losing
nearly Hie per pound. Mild coffees, here and
elsewhere, have not suffered in price to the
full extent of the depression, being unusually
favored br their statistical position In the
United States, but have met with little de
mand at reduced prices and are tending lower.
The causes of the downward movement axe
easily found in the weight of existing sup
plies, apparently good prospects for coming
crops and lack of confidence on the part of
buyers.

Budyard Kipling 1 Depends Upon His
Better Half for Cash. Supplies.
"Yes. I have been down to Brattlebbro
again this summer," said I one the other
day who has made it a practice to visit
that charming Vermont city each sum
mer for the past ten years. "I knew Kip
ling, as. of course, every one in town did
before he went back . to England. I vis
ited at the Balestlers', the daughter ' of
which family the author married.
"Kipling has no more regard or knowl
edge of the value of money than a baby.
His wife, who was Carrie Balestier. Is tile
business head of the Kipling Fiction
Foundry. It is she to whom he goes with
publishers' offers and , his :Â¦ half-formed
plans, and her decision In = all matters of
business is carried out to the letter by her
husband, who knows her Judgment to be
infallible and. therefore, has* the greatest
confidence in her. Kipling keeps notrack
of himself, at .all; frequently; having to
turn to his wife for answers to the slight
est personal questions. - Â¦ â¢ I > remember dis
tinctly one little incident Â¦ which occurred
while I was at the Balestiers';a few years
ago. : Kipling had < been out ? tramping all
morning, s. After dinnerâ he . used to eat
noon dinners In Vermontâ he went to his
writing room. Coming back-down stairs

One Man Out at San Diego.
SAX DIEGO. Dec. 8.â The strike of tele
graphers on the Santa Fe affected but one
man here, J. IL Clendinln, who obeyed
the order at 2 o'clock, turning over his

are four other operators besides the agent

Recently Parker wrote to a friend pro
testing hi5 innocence. The matter was
investigated and It was found that the.
suit which Parker had left at the hotel
was of better quality than the one he had
put on by mistake. Upon his presenta
tion of these facts, the Board of Pardons
unanimously gave Parker his liberty.
Parker then came to this State and re
sided in Bucks County. One night hÂ«* re
mained at a hotel and in the morning
donned. a suit of clothing hanging in the
room, mistaking it for his own. He was
rvrrested on the charge of larceny and at
his trial a Constable from New Jersey
testified that the defendant had been pre
viously arrested for larceny. This mili
tated against him and he was sentenced
to thirteen years' imprisonment.
Parker, who is now 27 years old, ob
tained employment in TJordenstown in
1891 and two years later was arrested on
the charge of stealing a watch. Later it
was found the watch had been mislaid by
the owner and the charge was withdrawn
and Parker was released.
tence in the Easton penitentiary. James
Parker of EHlsdale, N. J., has been re
leased as Innocent of the crimes with
which he was charged.

At that time there were various inter
esting law offices that have now, unfor

Clerk of the Hamper, the Frothonotary,
the Chaffer of .Wax, the Crier, and the
Joyners of the Tales. The latter office
must have been extremely underpaid at

Â£133 as pay and Â£200 for food. The
"clarke of the storehowse at Dettford
strand" received Â£32 13s 4d a year, and

Big Steamers Consume Proportion-
ately Less Cool Than Small Ones.
The tendency Is to increase the size and
speed of all steamers nowadays, and the
rule holds good in regard to self-trimmers,
says a writer in the Engineering Maga
zine. Many of them will carry 7000 tons
of coal as cargo at eleven knots, and there
Is sufficient evidence to support the view
that the larger 'the vesel the more eco
nomical. In proportion, is the coal con
sumption. A return now before me In
â¢which are given .the results of a large
number of voyages by different ships,
shows that a 9000-ton steamer running 267
miles a day had a consumption of .036
pound of coal per ton displacement per
mile. An 8000-ton steamer running 266
miles a day 'used .038 pound, while a 7000
tpn vessel steaming 26i miles a day burned
-.48 pound. A 6000-ton steamer going 257
miles a- day used .054 pound of coal per

Baronetcy . Perpetuates Names.
A baronetcy Is a very convenient thing
to Rive away It carries. with it no power,
not much In the way of social precedence
no personal decorationâ not even a ribbon
?^ star-and no more titular distinction
than does. a. mere knighthood. But it is
hereditary and goes to the founding of a
family. That Is -why this honor is sought
after by men who.- having raised them
selves to eminence, wish their names per
petuated. Great artists, physicians, men
of science, inventors, engineers, shipbuild
ers, merchants, civic dignitariesâ these
are .the men of whom we make baronets
now. But Jiey must have plenty of money
to leaveâ that Is lndlsne^iUlj 1 c.MMtjJal.â
