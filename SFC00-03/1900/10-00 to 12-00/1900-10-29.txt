JOHN F. BASS, who was with the
allied armies In the advance on
Peking as The Call-Herald's special
correspondent, arrived on tha
Gaelic yesterday and has apart
ments at the Palace. He Is accompanied
by his wife.
Mr. Bass' experience as a war corre
spondent has been lively and varied. He
was with Kitchener in Kitchener's first
expedition on the Nile, and he has seen
the Armenian massacres. Bass was the
Herald's correspondent during tha
Graeco-Turklsh war and the Zola trial and
ho was sent to the Philippines at the com
mencement of hostilities between this
country and Spain. He was sent to China
at the beginning of the Boxer outbreak.
To Mr. Bass must be given the credit of
sending to a newspaper the first direct
news of the taking of Peking. Bass'
assistant. James Hull, carried the dis
patches from Peking to' a point midway
between "Tungchow ,and Tientsin, from
where they were sent to Shanghai by way
of Taku and Chefu and finally to the
Danish cable. Hull Joined a Russian con
voy while bearing the dispatches. The
party was chased by Chinese cavalry and
was In imminent peril of being an
nihilated, but It eluded its pursuers. Hull
reached his destination on August 17 and
got the dispatches safely oft. Bass says
the news that Peking had fallen had been
carried previously by the Japanese cour
iers, but bis dispatches were the first to,
reach this country. *
Chine se Duplicity.
Bass makes serious charges against tna
Imperial Chinese Telegraph Company
which may involve that concern in diffi
culties. Bass was sending dispatches
while at the front and had employed a
man to see that they went out from
Shanghai after passing through Tientsin.
Taku and Chefu. This man, he says,
discovered that the telegraph company,
instead of delivering the dispatches, waa
quietly selling: them to the local press'
in Shanghai. Baas' agent was unable to
get the dispatches to send them to New
York by the Danish cable, and he made
a complaint to the managers of the com
pany. They informed him complacently
that their company had a contract with
the Shaoghia newspapers to deliver all
telegrams containing news of war that
came from the front, whether official or
otherwise. Complaint was then made to
the director general of the Imperial Tel
egraph, who, held all dispatches for ex
amination. That official allowed Bass*
agent to obtain a copy of the dispatches.
By paying extra rates he succeeded in
preventing the local newspapers from get
ting the dispatches for one day. Then
they were well on their way. Bass re
lates this Incident to show the corrupt
practices of the Imperial Telegraph offi
cials. Consul Goodnow informed Bass
that his employers had a good case for
indemnity against -the Chinese Govern
ment. '
No Care for Wounded.
Bass relates another incident which re
flects upon United States Minister Con
ger.
"When we came to Peking," says Bass,
"we had about thirty wounded men. The
chief surgeon in charge applied to Mia-.
lster Conger to allow the men to bÂ« taken
fnto one of the houses of the American
Legation. Conger, in answer to the sur
geon's appeal, said:
" 'I would rather not. The . legation is
too small. There are plenty of other
places In Peking."
"Upon the surgeon making another ap
peal." says Bass, "Conger said:
â¢â¢ "Well, if it is necessary, very well, but
I would rather you took them somewhere
else.'
"The surgeon," continues Bass, "saw
that the Chinese houses were not fit to,
be used for hospital purposes on account
of their filthy condition, and he was ob
liged to leave the wounded men outside
overnight It rained that night, ami
though the doctors made every effort tho
men suffered piteously. The British Lega
tion finally took the wounded in. Con
ger's action excited so much comment
among the officers that they all begged mo
to mention it in my reports.
"The missionaries showed very little
consideration for the wounded men, not
one even condescending to approach
them. hraBI

Duplicity of the
Chinese High
Officials.
WHAT will result from the
diplomatic negotiations be
tween the great powers of
the world concerning the
future of China no one
can. tell at the present moment; the
mere so when Oriental duplicity takes a
hand in the ordinarily conscienceless deal
ings of European diplomats. It Is a well
known fact that he who relies on what Is
Bald In the Orient is always misled. The
same is true of the Christian powers of
the world when they occupy themselves
with things "east of Suez."
To-day we hear that Russia desires the
. evacuation of Peking; to-morrow that
the same power has been obliged to re
inforce her garrison In the Chinese capi
tal. Germany strenuously declares that
she docs not desire the split of China, and
yet she pursues a policy which, if followed
to a consistent end. would not only de
stroy thÂ» Chinnep Government, but prob
ably throw the whole of China Into a state
<*>t war. Similar Inconsistencies between
word ar.d deed are to be found among the
other powers, perhaps with the exception
of the United States. For the United
States, has but one policy demanded by
her interests and that policy has been
steadfastly upheld by the Government â
?he desires the preservation of her trade
rights in China and consequently the
preservation of the Chinese empire in its
entirety.
Even England, fearful that the day of
/fnal division had arrived and that she
r a ould fail in getting her fair share of the
-polls, -undertook in the general upheaval
to obtain a single-handed occupation of
Shanghai and the control of the Yangtse
River. -*-;'<
In spite, however, of the difficulty In
reaching any satisfactory conclusion con
rerntngjthe future, one may at least clear"
the horizon by sweeping aside the mist of
diplomatic double dealing and concerning
one's self.alonewith hard and fast facts.
Eussia and Japan.
A very short Ftay in Eastern Asia will :
convince any one that fate designed two
nations to hold the strongest positions
th^re, Rursia and Japan. Of the two Rus-
Fia holds the higher hand on account of
her superior financial conditions and her
own vast resources. But it must not be
pupposed from this that Japan will not
play an Important role In the final settle
ment of the Eastern question, for Japan
next to Germany probably has the best
organized army In the world. Further
more, considering the peculiar conditions
nt campaigning over the bad roads of
China, the Japanese army has no superior
and probably no equal. In the late cam
paign on Peking, Russia has been the
first to recognize the superiority of the
Japanese army. Very early In the cam
paign a few observers saw many facts
which suggested a rapprochement between
Japan and Russia, and current events
.have brought about between these two
Â¦jowers a friendly feeling.
Go up Pelho River from Taku to Tung
chow. You find the Russians everywhere.
They hold the railway â they hold all
Ftrategical points. At Taku Russia,
France and Germany hold the outer forts
which command the approach of large
vessels. Russians occupy the great ar
prnal between Taku and Tientsin. Again
nt Tientsin the Russians hold the
fort that did so much damage to the for
eign settlement. Another arsenal above
Tientsin is also in Russian hands. For
months they have been preparing to hold
these strong positions rcrmanently, diplo
matic representations to the contrary
notwithstanding. It looks as If Russia

the Pelho- river, and the integrity of

Japan Needs Money.
Japan desires the integrity of China,
but does not wish to be left out in the
cold in case of a division. The increasing
burden of a large army and navy weigh
Kr-avily upon Japan and unless she can
borrow money in the markets of the world
the cannot hope to hold Russia long in

M. Waldeck-Rousseau Out
lines the Policy of
, . His Party.
PARIS. Oct. 29.â M. Waldeck-Rousseau
yesterday delivered at Toulouse the anx
iously awaited speech outlining the pol
icy and programme of the Government in
anticipation of the reassembling of Par
liament. The occasion was the laying of
the cornerstone of the new barracks there.
The Premier left Paris Saturday and ar
rived at Toulouso yesterday morning
(Sunday). He was received by the Mayor,
Senators and Deputies of the department
and other officials. The city was gayly
decorated and the populace cheered M.
'Waldeck-Rousseaii.
The Archbishop of Toulouse and gen
erals of the army corps dfllvered ad-
Oresses assuring the Premier, In behalf
of the clergy and. the army, of the re
epect for him and attachment to the re
public.
Replying to the assurances of the gen
erals M. Waldeck-Rousseau said: "The
army awakens to many hopes not to be
cherished by the country-. We are too
jealous of the future of the army not to
strive to have France not merely follow
the progress of other nations, but to out
strip them. We are sure the army will
respond to these efforts by devoting it
self entirely to its noble task and will
leave no place In its ranks for divisions,
which only weaken it"
The laying of the cornerstone took place
in the afternoon. The Premier reserved
his principal effort for the banquet which
followed the ceremony. This was given
by the municipality In an ancient Jacobite
convent, where the dining hall was elab
orately decorated with the tri-color. De
voting the principal part of his speech to
answering criticisms, he said he had not
replied before because the Cabinet had
received the widest and clearest mandate,
because it was time to act and not time
to talk, and because he and his colleagues
looked to the Chamber of Deputies alone
for approbation or censure of their con
duct.
Alluding to the great demonstration of
Mayors in Paris, which he described as
the "roost striking consecration any
regime has ever received," he said that
France had in this way shown how little
she was moved by biased accusations
against the Ministry.
Referring to the support which the So
cialists had given the Government he re
marked that the Government desired the
support of "those who, - having always
served the republic, are better entitled to
defend her than those who have opposed
her." â¢ .- .
Proceeding to sketch the gloomy situa
tion that existed when the Cabinet took
office â "with agitation increasing and na
tionalism engaging in daily battles with
the police"â he said that to face this con
dition of things a sincere concentration of
Republicans was brought about, "yet not
by conceding to each member of the Cab
inet something which separated him from
the others, but by excluding everything
that tended to division and. retaining ali
.that tended to unity."
"It Is said," he continued, ''that we are
leading the country to ruin when really it
would be only an exaggeration to say that
we .have saved her from ruin."
Going on to discuss the Government pro
gramme he said It did Include collectiv'sm
but that '.this did not - signify that the
policy of republican union excluded social
forms. He spoke of the success of the
Government in suppressing systematic
agitation and street demonstrations, add
ing that the country might hope durlns
the present calm to see marks of sincere
repentance on the part of the anti-Repuo
licans.
Alluding to what he described as the
"last act of the poignant Dreyfus drama,"
he said that the Judgment was given in
complete Independence and that the de
cision remained respected but that at the
same time humanity had found satisfac
tion In a "measure of clemency that has
been ratified by the generous heart of our
great country, which awakens at last"
. He announced, that he would ask the
Chamber of Deputies, as he had already
asked the Senate, to pas* a bill of effacÂ«
ment as "a measure necessary to assure
definitive appeasement."
"While these internal events are being
accomplished," he continued, "our posi
tion Is being strengthened abroad, where
we are supported, when necessary, by the
valor of our army. Our policy has regain
ed for us our former authority and suc
cess. We have shown ourselves deter
mined to abdicate nothing of our rightd,
and we are convinced that aggressive
blustering has done nothing in common
with true patriotism.
"When the exposition opened the Gov
ernment deemed .that. . after undergoing
such violent shocks, the country would be
left to taste the benettts of a needful
truce. This period of peace has been
filled with glorlus work. No more fruit
ful Ideas were ever agitated than came
to the front in the exposition congresses."
The Premier dwelt upon the necessity
of enforcing discipline among state offi
cials. '< He expressed the 'hope that the
budget would be voted, and referred to
,the :. projected dlminuition of the excise
duty on alcohol, which is one of the lead-
Ins internal questions. After this he en
larged upon the necessity that the Cham
ber should pass a law regulating asso
ciations, a measure directed against re
ligious congregations. He dilated upon
the dangers attending the accumulation

So much coal was destroyed by the re

would be a shortage of fuel during- the
winter. Ledges of the black stuff have,
howevtr, been found at various points
along the coast and now the local market
is being supplied from local mines. Tnis

but it has shewn up so well that it will
without a doubt make many a man
wealthy in the future.
There is nothing new in mining reports;
that is, nothing nas come -in lately that
has not already been reported. The
Koyukuk.-Bluestone, Tanana and Topkuk
districts are confirming the reports of
their richness. The Bfuestone, in par
ticular, is showing up well, so well in fact
that I do not hesitate to say that next
year it will. outdo Nome itself in its out
put. The Arctic district, just over the
divide from Cape York, is attracting much
attention and a stampede has already set
out that way. One man recently returned
from there with $17,00), the result of about
two weeks' labor en a claim he had lo

been discovered on St. Matthews Island.

SEATTLE. Wash., Oct. 28.â Clark C.
Carr, the son, and Torrey Carr, the
grand nephew of General Clark E. Carr,
were drowned in Lake Washington early
this morning. News of the accident camo
in late this afternoon and a steamer was
immediately taken out to where their ca
noe'was picked up,, but darkness set in
before any dragging for the bodies could
be done. . ,v
Clark C. Carr was about 23 years old
and had lived in Seattle only a few weeks,
coming out from Galesburg, 111., the home
of his rather, to continue the study of
law i'i the olP.ce of his uncle, General
E. M. Carr, of the ilrm of Preston. Carr
& Gllnian of this city. Torrey Carr was
16 years old and a son of B. O. Carr
of this city, who Is a brother of E. M.
Carr and a nephew of General Clark E.
Carr. Torrey Carr was a student in the
University of Washington.
The two young men started on a ducK
hunting expedition early this morniDg.
taking a Peterborough canoe at LescnÂ»
Park on Lake Washington about 4 a. m.
They took with them a setter dog and
a quantity of cold lunch. They were last
seen off the north end of Mercer Island
by other hunters about 6 o'clock.
According to the reports brought to the
cily this evening cries were heard from
tho north end of the island about 7 o'clock,
but little attention was paid, as those who
heard supposed some hunters were call
ing for their dog. About 9 o'clock Gus
Hawercamp, a Mercer Island rancher,
started in a boat for. Leschi Park and
came across the Peterborough canoe bot
tom side up about half a mile from the
north end of the island. He took the
canoe in tow and brought it to the park,
where it was immediately recognized as
the one taken out by the Carr boys.
Shortly afterward "W. IT. Flnck of this
city, who was also out hunting, picked
up two caps, and several fresh apples,
which had been part of the lunch of the
unfortunote hunters. Coming toward
Leschi Park he also picked up a couple
of paddles belonging to the canoe.
The .news was quickly sent in from
Leschl Park to E. 11 Carr and B. O. Carr
of this city, who as soon as ararngements
could be made chartered the steamer
â¢Haas and for several hours cruised about
Mercer Island, with the vain hope that
the boys had gotten ashore. They found
the setter, which had swam ashore, but
no trace of the hunters could be discov
ered. As the hour grew late no attempt
was made to drag the bottom for tnÂ©
bodies, but the search will be taken up
early to-morrow morning.
The theories of the cause of thÂ« accident,
are many. It Is thought that thÂ» recoil aÂ£
a gun may have upset the canoe, or thÂ»
dog may have become excited after a shot
and upset the frail craft. Both of the.
boys were known to be able swimmers,
and for many hours the hope was cher
ished that they had got ashore, bnt tho
careful search of Mercer Island, the near
est land, failed to reveal a trace beyond
the finding of the doar.

CHICAGO. Oct. 28.â The Postofflco
clerks of Chicago to-day entered the
ranks of the tradÂ© unionists. The clerks
have affiliated themselves with thÂ© Amer
ican Federation of Labor and the new or
ganization will be known as the Chicago
PostofHce Clerks' Union. It is claimed
that practically all of the 1400 postofflce
employes in Chicago are Included in the
movement.
Foremost among the objects for which
the new union is to -strive will be tha
adoption of the eight-hour working day
for letter carriers.:. Another Â¦ object to be
given almost equal prominence will be the
agitation in favor of Federal legislation
that will fix absolutely the rate of wages
for letter carriers and other postofnee
employes, taking, the .matter completely
out of the hands of the "promotion board"
and other similar agencies.
It is to be a labor union pure and sim
ple and will direct its efforts solely to tho
problem of bettering "thejot of the rank
and file of the postofflce employes.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
-Mr. and Mrs. Bryan then- left the hotel
and walked through Madison Square to
the Madison Square Presbyterian Church.
When Mr. Bryan first appeared on the
street there were very few people about,
but those "who- were there instantly recog
nized him and with many a shout fol
lowed him to the door of the church.
The Yale and Harvard boys, who came. to
New York with Mr. Bryan on Saturday,
Â¦were also at the church and occupied
seats" a short "distance in front of Mr.
Bryan. ..
Dr. ParkhursV the pas.tor, was not In
formed of Mr. Bryan s presence and his
sermon was an exposition of a portion of
the Scriptures. Word - was evidently
passed through the congregation during
the. service that Mr. Bryan was in the
church, for when the benediction was
pronounced almost the entire congregation
made a dash for the doors Â¦ and crowded
the sidewalk and street In front of the
building. This crowd was augmented by
those who were" on the street and in the
square and by the time the party reached
the hotel two thousand persons crowded
about them. So dense was the crowd, in
fact, that It became necessary for several
park policemen to go in advance of Mr.
Bryan and .clear a way for him. As he
disappeared in the entrance of the hotel
the crowd cheered. *
Mr. Bryan slept In hie room from 1
o'clock until 5, when he dined. From the
time he finished dinner until 9 o'clock to
night, when he left the Hoffman House,
there was a steady stream of callers. Mr.
and Mrs. Bryan were both kept busy
shaking hands. Among the callers were
Congressman Sulzer Frank Campbell,
James McGuire, ex-Governor "VN ullam J.
Stone and Congressman. Richardson.
At 9 o'clock Mr. -Bryan a-d party left
the hotel for the Granu Central station,
where they took the. train for Albany. A
squad of twenty-two policemen, two
roundsmen and a sergeant kept the crowd
back, and a platoon of twenty mounted
"policemen escorted Mr. Bryan to the sta
tion.. Notwithstanding the fact that his
departure .was -not announced in any of
the morning papers, the peopl 2 appeared
to find it out In some way, and 3000 were
gathered about the hotel eagerly awaiting
his appearance. As soon as he emerged
with Mrs. Bryan a great shout went up.
On the way up Broadway to the station
crowds of people- lined the streets on
either side and shout after snout rent the
air. At the Grand Central station Mr!
Bryan was at once recognized by the
crowds awaiting their trains, and it was
with. great difficulty that the police held
the people back and kept a passageway
for the party.
Mr. Bryan's private car. the Rambler,
was attached to the New York Central,
which was scheduled to leave at 9:30. As
the: train pulled out .with Mr. and Mrs.
Bryan on the rear platform there were
more cheers. ''...., :
. Mr. Bryan will stop first at Albany and
will- come , back to-morrow, arriving at
Weehawken at 6:25 p. m., where he will
be met by Congressman Sulzer and driven
to Hamilton Fish Park for a ten-minute
speech, thence to the Academy of Music
in Brooklyn, arriving there at 7:30, where
he is to address a meeting. He will speak
also at seven other places in Brooklyn
during the evening. .
COMMENT OF BXJSSIAU" PRESS.
Interest \ Displayed in the Coming
Election in" the United States.
ST." PETERSBURG, Oct. 28.â The Rus
sian press is displaying - considerable In
terest in the coming election ln the United
States. 8everal organs have reached the
conclusion that both parties occupy vir
tually the same position. Regarding Â¦ Im
perialism, Prince -Utomskl's paper, the
Viedomosti, says:
"It is not important which candidate is
elected, and it will be useful to observe
the advance and reflux of the imperialistic
wave." 'Â¦ ;' Â¦' Â¦-" Â¦Â¦ -Â¦ Â¦ ;-_..-W.-iT-
The paper adds: "American imperialism
regards colonies as a means, not an end.
America --: wishes economic domination
over the universe, Which explains her ef
forts to girdle the world with colonies.
She desires a foothold in China, and even
In Turkey, as the recent Indemnity affair
showed. American - imperialism, unlike
that of â¢ England, is not due to economic
necessity, since now the market Â» Is big
enough. ' ;
The paper expresses the opinion that the
imperialistic wave has receded markedly
since 1898, and it contrasts imperialism
with' Monroeism, ' adding: "Monroeism is
embarrassing to " the imperialists, who

With the Election Only a Week Distant There Is Naught
to Give Hope to the Democratic Candidate.
NEW YORK. Oct. 28.â Only one week
remains of the Presidential campaign.
New York State has been the battlefield
for two weeks, and will continue to be so
until the end. The Democrats are playing
for the thirty-six electoral votes of the
Empire State, and unless they get them
William J. Bryan has no chance of being
elected President of the United States.
From outward signs The Call sees no
reason to change its estimate of the prob
abilities already printed. The Call on
October 1 printed an electoral table made
up from reports received from correspond
ents who had been in the doubtful States.
This table showed the following:. For Mc-
Klnley. 258; for Bryan, 168; doubtful, a. ,
. A fuller and more comprehensive can
vass of the United States had been made
by Sunday, October 21, and The Call on
that date printed another table, indicating
281 electoral votes for McKinley and 166
for Bryan.
As political weather gauges, one politi
cal demonstration offsets another. If the
Bryan reception meant that all of the
male spectators intended to vote for Mr.
Bryan and If the Roosevelt affair meant
that all of the male spectators intended to
vote for McKinley. then Bryan Is going to
have a vote in Greater New York that will
make the State doubtful. It is only on
some such assumption that New \ork
State can be considered doubtful. If there
is an undercurrent that is concealed by
Ithe crowds that greet the Republican
candidates and made known only by the
crowds that greet the Democratic candi
date, then Mr. Bryan has a chance of
This is Richard Croker's theory. It is
also Mr. Bryan's. They claim that there
is a tremendous vote swayed by a deep
undercurrent that will not make known
its Intention until election day. Hope of
this vote being cast for Bryan Is based on
the demonstrations in this city and In
New Jersey and Maryland. 'and not upon
the greeting extended to the Democratic
candidate during his first tour of rural
New York. His further Journey of the
State, beginning to-day, will .be watched
with close interest. If he has a welcome
much more genial than was accorded him
before Republicans may well look out.
But, all other conditions remaining equal,
the Republicans rest easy regarding the
outcome in New York.
In other States conditions have not
greatly changed. The battle in the
East reveals undiminlshed confidence on
the Republican side and renewed activity
by the Democrats. . Reports from West
Virginia. Maryland and Delaware vary.
The Democrats, â¢ feeling the groundswell
caused by Mr. Bryan's speeches, think
they see a chance to carry these States.
On the other hand, sound money Demo
crats, especially ln Maryland, are becom
ing more and more aggressive and are
marking up their majorities. The Indiana
campaign continues with , undiminished
vigor. Democrats report encouragement
from campaign contributions from Â¦ other
States. This indicates that the Bryan
managers are getting assistance from
some unusual sources. The same report
comes from West Virginia, where large
sums were* received ln at least three coun
ties last week.
In many campaigns the battle has been
lost ln the laet two or three weeks of the
struggle. Blaine was ln the lead in 1884,
so all his supporters believe. 'as late; as
October 10, yet he had bad luck and worse
management. His attendance at the Del
monico dinner and the famous : speech of
Rev.' Dr. Burchard lost him the election.
So, too, In 1888 Cleveland would have been
elected if he had had proper work done for
him in New York State. .
In the last days of the present campaign
much hard work will be done. Governor
Roosevelt and Chauncey M. Depew will
tour New '.York from end to end.- Mr.
Bryan will speak in the State to-morrow
and Tuesday and then ' will go West,
speaking in Ohio,- Indiana. Illinois "and
Nebraska. John - B." Stanchfleld. W.
Bourke Cockran and David B. Hill will
address meetings- almost continuously
during the week. '
From the Republican . standpoint â¢ the
wind-up, of the New York fight will be on
Saturday. All signs point to the conclu
sion that this event will be one of the
greatest civic pageants ever held in .the
Kast. . It is promised that there ; will be
140,000 men In line. Such a demonstration
would disprove the Bryan claim that there

BRYAN MAKES NO PROGRESS IN
THE FIGHT FOR NEW YORK'S VOTE
N*EW YORK, Oct. 28.â It is said ln
Paterson. X. J., that the present Grand
Jury will take up the Inquiry into the
death of Jennie Bosschieter, for whose
murder McAlister. Death. Campbell and
Kerr are confined ln jail. Statements hav
ing appeared tending to show that there
would likely be a delay by the author
ities, it is given out that the investigation
is to be pushed vigorously. Dr. Town
send, who refused to appear on the wit
ness stand yesterday, will appear at tha
inquest next Tuesday night. His reason
for not answering the subpena was an
order from the authorities to testify re
garding the visit of the prisoners to him
on the night of the murder. Dr. Town
send now makes the following statement
or the midnight call and in connection
with the case:
"it has Deen sta.ted that the four men
made two caiis at my ofllce and that the
girl was alive wnen ihe carriage llrst ar
rived. They came but once,- and it was
then too late to render aid to the unfor
tunate girl. 1 am positive of the exact
time of their arrival, because when the
bell rang at the heaa of the bed 1 looked
at the clock on the mantel and saw it
was 2 o"clock. Through the speaking tube
I inquired the cause of the summons, and
was told that there had been an accident
and was asked to come at once. Through
the tube 1 asked particulars and was met
with the word that the patient was in a
carriage at the door. It was cold, but I
waltea only to put on a bath robe and
went down stairs. When the door was
opened two men whom I knew as George
Kerr and Walter McAlister shoved me
inbide and quickly- stepped inside. Then
I was to!d that a young woman had been
hurt and both men declared that they
would carry her in.
"But without parley I brushed them
aeide and wont out to the carriage. It
was a big two-seated rig that 1 had seen
often at the Erie depot. 1 did not see
the hackman. There were two men
standing at the curb near the carriage. I
knew Campbell by sight. Inside the car
riage a young woman was half seated,
half lying across the back of the rear
seat. Her head lay sidewise across her
breast. 1 lifted her head and laid it back
gently. It was limp and lifeless. The
clothing was disarranged, the hair hang
ing about her neck and shoulders. Her
waist had been lossened and only the two
top buttons of the waist were buttoned.
There waa no pulse. The heart had been
stilled.
"Then I climbed on the rig to make
a closer examination of the four men
gathered at the side of the carriage. Their
laces were white and they looked a ques
tion. The body was cold. "Boys," I said
to them, "I can do nothing, she Is dead "
They seemed to draw back and were all
together when I stepped within the door
and left them in conference at the curb.
It was five minutes after 2 when 1 re
turned upstairs."
Dr. Townsend said the men had In
sisted that the woman should be taken
into his otiiie, even after he had* pro
nounced her dead. Early the next day he
saw the account of the rinding of the body
of Jennie Bosschieter near Wagram
bridge.
During his examination of the young
woman in the carriage it had been too
dark to distinguish the features and the
circumstance* of the position of the body,
with the gash in the back of the head and
the fractured skull reported in the au
topsy added to the mystery.
On Friday afternoon he decided to seek
the advice of professional friends, who
were made acquainted with the full de
tails. When it appeared that the cases
wtre identical, the authorities were noti
fied.
Dr. Townsend visited the chief of police
and gave the information in his posses
sion and the arrests followed.

EVIDENCE THAT
MAY HANG THE
FOUR SUSPECTS
POUGHKEEPSIE, X. V., Oct. 28.â For
several days past the corridors of Vassar
College have been hung with campaign
posters announcing that a Republican
mass>-meetiug would be held in Phil Ha.l
la.st night. The poeters were enormous
uttuXra, bearing sucn devices a3 tne full
dinner pail, the p*riy elephant, etc. The
nieeiing was much ;arger man the one
hc-ia by the Hea^ocraiic students when
.Mr. Bryan spoke there.
At 6 o'clock a procession formed on the
t'jurth floor and marched through the dif
ferent corridors to. Phil Hall. The girls
formed lines aiong the hall and fell in be
hind like boys following a circus parade.
Tiie procession *.rai headed by a band of
forty pieces, the instruments being combs,
bass emms and cymbals. The musicians
made a very striding appearance ln yel
luw three-cornered caps and knickerbock
ers, blue ecats lined v.-ith yeilow satin and
powdered wigs. Soldiers paced up and
down before the door of tne hail and a
number of corpulent policemen were sta
tioned within to suppress any outburst
of Bryani5Ta. In the nail were hung huge
pictures of McKinley and the stage was
Craped with flags.
The chairman of the meeting introduced
as the first speaker Mr. Marcus Hanna,
who made a brief address, baying:
"Though we have made a few mistakes
during tne past four years we have done
our best, and pleaeÂ« consider every vote
you cast for Bryan is an insult to me."
After the Fpeeca of Mr. Hanna's im
personator the band played a patriotic
air and a female voice in the entrance
said. "Come in, George." and Mr. and
Mrs. George Dewey entered. They took
seats on the platform and the spectators
went wild with enthusiasm.
The second speaker of the evening was
Hon. Chauncey M. Depew, who looked
very lifelike and told many interesting.
humorous stories. After his speech four
laboring men attired in patched overalls
came on the stage and sang a selection
ar.d flourished full dinner pails and ban
dana, handkerchiefs at the audience.
The climax of the meeting was the ap
pearance of Theodore Rooswelt attired in
Kough Rider costume. Ho said he was
not there to lead a charge up San Juan
Hill, but to make a crusade on noise in
college after 10 p. m. He concluded by
paying that he, the Governor of New
York State, the prospective Vice Presi
dent of the United States and admirer of
Vassar College, merely wished the stu
dents to remember one thing â to vote for
the right men, William McKinley and

IN A TRAVESTY
ON POLITICS
Mr. Morton, then Minister to France, that
"the Government of the United States
would regard with grave anxiety any at
tempt en the part of France to force by
hostile pressure the payment by Venezu
ela of her debt to French citizens." The
same view would be taken of any action
on the part of Germany contemplating im
mediate payment of the debt due German
capitalists or the acquisition by. Germany
of Venezuelan territory instead. In his
famous message to Congress President
Monroe declared "that we should consid
er any attempt on their part (the nations
of Europe) to estend their system to any
portion of this hemisphere as dangerous
to our peace and safety." Acquisition by
Germany .of territory in Venezuela conse
quently would be in violation -of the Mon
roe doctrine.
Naval officers say that Germany could
have only one object in establishing a
naval station In the Western Hemisphere,
and that would be to prepare for hostili
ties against the United States. It is true
that the Germans have large interests In
Central and South America and they
necessarily require protection, but such
protection can be assured by moral pres
sure rather than by waging war. The
United States is the only power whose
competition the â¢Berlin Government fears.
When it became apparent that this Gov
ernment would not permit the acquisition
of the Danish West Indies by any Euro
pean state, reports were put into circula
tion that Germany was endeavoring to es
tablish a coaling station at Santa Catha
rina. Brazil. These reports were not con
firmed, and it is not believed by the of
ficials that Germany would take any ac
tion looking to the establishment of a
coaling station in the Western Hemis
phere without first notifying the United
States, though undoubtedly she would
initiate preliminary negotiations with the
country from which she desired the privi
lege.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTKL. WASHINGTON Oct 2S -
Any attempt on t! e part of Germany to
establish a waling station in Venezuela.
or In any otht-r country of* the Western
Hemisphere, will be opposed by the
United States. Such action would' be in
violation of the principles of the Monroe
fioctnne. which the administration is de
termined to uphold. Germany is anxious
to acquire sites for coaling stations in the
A\ estern Hemisphere. At the time this
Government commenced negotiations for
the acquisition of the Danish
Wes-t Indies it was well un
derstood in official circles here that
Germany was anxious to obtain control
of them, and it was only the determined
attitude of the President that forced her
to relinquish her designs on those islands.
It has been frequently reported that Ger
meny was endeavoring to establish a
coaling station on the Brazilian coast, but
no negotiations have been entered into,
simply because of the knowledge that this
Government wcuUl strcnply object to the
raising of the German Hag in the Western
Hemisphere.
Mr. Pulido. Venezuelan Charsre d'Af
faires. told me Â«o-d:iy that he ha<1 heard
nothing confirmatory of the rumor that
his Government v.-as considering the ad
visability of leasing to Germany a port, on
the Island of MarKaxita for use as a coal-
Ing station. It v.-as evident that Mr. Pu
lido did not place any credence in the re
port. Venezuela is indebted to German
capitalists for quite a large amount grow
ing out of the construction of the railroad,
but it is not known here that Germany is
demanding the lease of a s=ite for a coaling
station in lieu of pavment.

INCREASING EASE IN THE
BERLIN MONEY MARKET
Great Demand for American Railway
Securities. and 300,000,000 Marks
Subscribed for Hamburg Loan.
BERLIN, Oct. 28. â October is drawing to
a close among conditions of increasing
ease In the money market. The prolonga
tion of money has fallen to Z\i. and there
are Instances of loans at Z%. Many
months have passed since the increase of
the monthly settlement proved so favor
able for the bulls. The progress of the
settlement shows a larger short element
than had been expected, which has been
forced' to cover, thereby strengthening
the market.
At the weekly meeting of the RelchB
bank Commission, Herr Koch, president
of the bank, said that their accounts
and loans had fallen 5,000,000 marks since j
the beginning of the month, aa compared i
with 113,000,000 during the corresponding
period last year. On the other hand, he
explained that | the gold stock had In- ,
creased 74,000,000 marks, as against 62,000,
000 marks during the corresponding period
in 1899, and now stood at 70,000,000 marks
above last year's figures. He also point
ed out .that private discount was 3% in
stead Of 5Viâ the rate In 1899, and that
money had ; grown easier on the bourse.
Considering his- statement, he expressed
the opinion that notwithstanding the ap
proach of the end of the year and despite
the political situation, there was no oc
casion for changing the bank rate.
The Bourse had, upon the whole, a good
week. Iron shares generally advanced,
notwithstanding a new batch of unfa
vorable-news from the iron centers. Ce
ment . shares Bcored a considerable rise
upon the prospective' completion of the
syndicate. ' -
Imperial and Prussian loans improved,
on account of the Increasing demand for
fixed, lnvestme.-ts since I the holders of
mortgage bank obligations began selling
a week ago. The other institutions of this
class have formed a guarantee fund of
15,000,000 marks' to" purchase the obliga
tions of the mortgage bank,' whose quota
tions Â¦ broke violently week before last:
This, however, has not checked apprehen
sion, and tho sales in this line continue.*
The demand for American railway se
curities was excellent- It Is ascertained
from a reliable quarter that the subscrip
tion for the Hamburg loan of 50,000,000
marks reached 800,000,000, a. result that is
considered brilliant. The Frankfurter
Zeltung, . recalling the recent loan in New
York, says: "The brilliant success of the

tried a score or more of native Filipinos
on charges of murder, murderous assault,
robbery, abduction arxl violation of the
laws of war. In most instances the death
penalty was imposed, although In only
two cases was it actually executed, the
others being commuted to Imprisonment
at hard labor. In one Instance a native
organized a miniature Insurrection and
with a small squad of Filipinos made an
armed raid on the town of Tuguegaro to
release some of his fellows who were held
prisoners there by the United States. He
was sentenced to hard labor and impris
onment for thirty years, and this sentence
later was commuted to ten years* impris

CONSTB.TJCTION OP FBE1TCH
RECIPROCITY TREATY
Protest Against Action of the Treas-
ury -Department to Be Adjudi
cated.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 28.â The negotia
tions concerning the construction to be
placed upon certain features of the reci
procity agreement with France have now
advanced to a point where the French
authorities have deemed it necessary to
pretest against what they regard as the
arbitrary course of the Treasury Depart
ment in reopening .-â¢ Issue which pre
viously had been adjudicated by the
American courts.
The reciprocity agreement was entered
into and proclaimed by the President
about a year ago. It granted certain re
duction of duties on still wines, brandies
and other articles in return for equivalent
reduction of duties on certain American
imports Into France. The French version
of the treaty, which was executed along
with the English text, contained the word
"llquers" covering a number of cordials
and like products brought to this country.
The Treasury Department held, however,
that under the reciprocity clause of the
Dingley tariff law â¢â¢llquers" could not be
made the subject of reciprocity conces
sions. The matter waa taken into the
courts where it was decided in favor of
the French authorities. The decision was
not appealed, and on the recommendation
of the Attorney General was accepted.
Recently, however, the Swiss Govern
ment put in a claim under its favored na
tion clause for the same reduction on
liquers as was given to France. This has.
led the Treasury Department to again
make an effort to oppose a reduction of
duty on such articles. From the French
standpoint the matter is not only one of
treaty, but of the construction of that
treaty which has been adjudicated by the
American courts and the adjudication ac
cepted. The French view of the situation
has now been brought to the attention ot
the State Department with a view of hav
ing the matter settled as It has been de
cided by the courts.
HEAVY DOWNPOTJB OF
RAIN AT HONOLTJI.Tr
Two Years Does Considerable
Damage.
"Worst Storm Which Has Occurred in
HONOLULU, Oct. 28.â The heaviest rain
storm which has occurred here within two
years broke at 7 o'clock Tuesday night.
For half an hour the rain fell in torrents
and within a short while the streets were
Impassable. By the time that the rain
ceased to fall, however, the worst feature
of the storm, in the shape of floods, ap
peared. The rainfall in Nuuanu Valley,
about two miles from Honolulu,, was 8.15
inches and It varied slightly nearer the
city.. The Nuuanu stream was soon
swollen beyond its boundaries and came
sweeping, down with increasing speed. It
broke Its banks and washed every mova
ble object away. Acres of the town on
both sides of the river were submerged
to a depth of three feet and some of the
houses near the bank were almost washed
away, the Chinese being driven away In
wild haste. The water covered the floors
two feet deep in some cases. A good
sized portion . of River street was washed
away and the bridge leading to the Pal
ama district was carried away.
The heaviest rainfall In the city proper
was 4.17 Inches, while thÂ© heaviest on
the island occurred on the north side- of
the mountains, being 9.10 Inches. Naone.
a- native workman, was drowned In the
flood at the Honolulu plantation, six miles
from here.

Special Dispatch to Tbe Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 28.â Tha World has
the following from Bristol, R, I.: As an
nounced nearly, two weeks ago, the Her
reshoffs will build the next; defender of
tho America's Cup.
"There is not the slightest, room for
doubt," remarked a well Informed yachts
man to the World correspondent to-day,
"that | Designer Nat Herreshoff mapped
out his plans for the now Cup defender
months ago and tthat on the occasion of
their visit to Bristol recently he- gave W.
Butler Duncan Jr. and Commodore Lewis
Cass Ledyard of the New York Yacht
Club to understand that no fears need be
entertained of his ability to fashion and
construct a faster yacht than the Colum
bia. At that time plans for- the new
yacht were discussed and the intimation
was given Captain Nat that he might pro
ceed to make preparations for an early
start on the new yachting marvel.
"The Columbia was launched on June
10, 1899, but could have been turned out
earlier had quicker work been necessary.
The keel of the next cup defender will be
cast before Christmas and she will be
ready for launching by the middle of May,
if present plans go not amiss.
"The report that a model of, the next de
fender has already been shaped $ and
shown to New York yachtsmen is not
true. The block from which the model of
the new century defender will be carved
was prepared in the Herreshoff shops
only yesterday and removed to Captain
Nat's private workshop, where he will
whittle It into shape. Not even the de
signer's servants have access to this
wizard's den. Until positive action was
taken on the Upton challenge, Captain.
Nat busied himself with his multitudin
ous duties about the boat shops, but dur
ing the past week his attention has been
focused upon the drawings and specifica
tions for the new yacht and the many
points hÂ« proposes to bring out in the
latest design. 'â¢
"You may rest assured that Herreshoff s
mind has not lost its conception nor Her
reshoff'a hand its cunning, and that. the
coming cup champion will be worthy of
the time honored trophy."
The report that Henry F. Lippett may
be selected to manage 'the yacht was re
ceived with general satisfaction here, as
it waa taken to mean that an American
yachtsman of approved merit would be in
charge and Captain Harry Haff, skipper
of the Lippitt schooner Qulsetta, at the
helm. Like his father. Captain Hank Haft
is a first class skipper. . '^f-'''

Tne quarrel arose from the Count's
notorious attack upon the generals return

demanded an explanation from Senor
Silvela. The latter declared that he was
not the author of the criticisms and he

Special Dispatch to The Call.
. NEW YORK, Oct. 28,-Llttle by little
the. mystery, which has surrounded the
death of aged Mllionalre William Marsh
Rice Is being penetrated. Professor Ru
dolph A. Witthaus has positively declared
that the bichloride of mercury discovered
In the stomach and Intestines of the re
cluse was in sufficient quantities to have
caused his death.
Now that this important fact has been
established the next link in the chain of
evidence which may lead to one of the
most sensational murder trials of the cen
tury will be to find where this poison was
purchased and by whom.
Professor Witthaus. who made the
chemical analysis of the contents of tha
stomach and intestines of Mr. Rice, saitl
to-day that he would make a report to
Coroner Hart to-morrow or next day,
supplementary to that made public to
day. Professor Witthaus refused to out
line the 'matters which he would discuss
In his supplementary report.
"In, what form was the poison adminis
tered to Mr." -Rice, if in your opinion it
was administered to him in any manner?"
Professor Witthaus was asked. â¢
"It would not be proper for me to dls
cuss that matter," said the chemist. "It
is not for me to say who administered that
poison or whether it was given with crim
inal Intent. The police can now complete
the work which I have begun."
It is probable that the will in which the
greater portion of the Rice millions are
bequeathed to Patrick will be offered for
probate this week. Â¦
Chemist Witthaus Tells
How Millionaire Rice
Was Killed.
ENOUGH POISON
FOUND TO HAVE
CAUSED DEATH
Fully two hours were spent in trying
experiments in various forms of animal
raising, all of which proved unsuccessful,
the horses kicking and snorting and mak
ing matters worse. Finally one of the
animals wa3 dragged out of the hole, more
dead than alive. The removal of the sec
ond animal was even harder, and was
only accomplished after the horse had
been almost choked to death. Neither of
the poor brutes was,severely injured, de
spite the tumble and the pullings and
haulings they received.
The number of people who were so kind
with advice grew so large that a squad of
police under Captain Dunleavy was busied
keeping them on the move.
THERE may be some clever drivers
of horses connected with the Sut
ter Street Railroad, but Driver
Mose Rice is not one of them. An
excavation on Market street, near
Steuart, made by workmen repairing the
sewer, gave Rice a chance to try his skill
yesterday morning on one of his trips to
the ferry. The space between the rails is
dug out, and the car drivers halted their
cars about twenty feet on either side or
the hole, unhitched and drove around it,
leaving the 'conductor to shove the car
over. Rice had made several trips and
succeeded in making a record for himself
A message was sent to the office of the
railroad company, and a force of men
with a wagon load of blocks and tackle
was hurried to the scene.
as the man who could bring his team
nearest the edge of the opening. His next
trial proved disastrous. The horse-near
est the hole -cliicd. and its'- hind legs
slipped on. the cobbles and slid over the
edge. So rapid was the plunge that its
mate was dragged over with it.
Rice clung to the ribbons but could not
stay the downward progress of the steeds.
In a few moments the usual crowd gath
ered, and Driver Rice received more sug
gestions as to how to extricate the ani
mals than he could avail himself of.

Horning Post Less Friendly, and
Suggests That Lester Heiff Has
K"ot B?en Biding "With
Usual Confidence.
LONDON. Oct. 28.â The r.upstion of
Knglishtversus American methods in the
racing world continues to agitate the
sporting writers for the London press. The
Daily Telegraph ncain protests against
the lfiea that the supporters of Lord Dur
ham are animated by feelings of Jealousy,
and points to instances of warm welcome
extended to American owners and jockeys.
"So far as the American trainers are
concerned," it says, "there was never an
unfriendly word used until one or two of
the latest comers were suspected of "dop-
Jr.g" their horse's. This is a punishable
offense in the United States and ought to
be here also."
The Morning Post suggests that Lester
RelJf has not been riding of late with his
tv -I confidence. It eulogizes Maher and
J^i.tdns. the latter of whom has been
er.^a^red by Prince Soltykoff.
The Standard, which makes the stew
ards cf the Jockey Club responsible for
the recent trouble, declares that Lord
Durham's attack was directed primarily â¢:
against their "Â¦fjpineneFS and torpidity." I
It accusps them of ignorance and mis- I
placed enemy, and cites a case where, i
last week, they summoned a gentleman i
of the highest character, whose Integrity j
It would be absurd to doubt, to explain i
The running of his horses. '
Tho Times, rfter remarking that "It j
would he difficult to overpraise the ser- j

cauf of turf reform, says:

"Lord Durham cites Instances wherp !

than English ruffians such as have always

"If anything can possibly be done to

$7 for the same irstead of $3 10. which
they receive at present. The brakemen de

WILKESBARRE. Pa.. Oct. 23.-A11 the
coal companies in the Wyoming Valley

BET.UN. Oct. 2S.â Prince Hohenlofa*
to-day made some Interesting >tatementa
regarding his resignation of the chancal
lorship. Although expressing himself
with great caution he cited as the prin
cipal reason for his resignation the fact
that he had noticed for some time a
growing desire to ignore him on Important
occasions. He admitted that his increas
ing deafness, especially in the left ear,
had made it annoying for Emperor Wil
liam to converse with him.
While Prince Hoheniohe would not sa>
precisely what very recent occasion had
particularly emphasized this inclination
to ignore him he asserted that thla was
the Immediate cause of his goine to Ham
burg with a written request to relinquish
his official burdens.
This, he said, he presented in person
to Emperor Yv'illiam. who seemed aston
ished. But replied that In view of the ad
vanced asre of the Prince he would not
urge him to reconsider. It also appear*
that his parting with the Kaiser was af
fectionate and that both remain on good
terms.
When Prince Hohenlohe returns to Ber
lin for the winter ?ie intends to frequen:
the court and its festivities, his physi
cians having urged him to this course. 03
they consider that the total absence vt
excitement would endanger his life. H.>
is about to go to his ancestral- horse at
Schilllngfuerst. Later he will go to Mu
nich and then to Meran. in the Austrian
Tyrol, and to Italy, where he hopes to gtt
relief from an annoying cough.

ical moments, and lost her chances - to
compete In the final.
Both dogs performed well, Rocker show-
Ing old-time form, and his son proving
himself a speedy, clever youngster.' In
the second round Rocket made It easy
with Headwater, and in the next led and
won all the way from Fine Fire. The
same thing happened against Forget and
Mayflower, who was a 4 to 1 favorite. In
his last course he led Greenhall well, and
took -the turn.
, H. A. Deckelman's veteran Rocker and
his -sapling Master Rocket divided first
and second honors in the big 112-dog open
stake at Union Park yesterday. Rocker
closed the sixth round by beating Fiery
Face In a punishing course, which left
him a contestant for final honors against
his kennel mate. , With nothing but a
question of superiority at stake Deckel
man, waived the running of the final.

REVIEW OF CONDITIONS
IN THE REALTY MARKET
SHORTLT after noon yesterday the bridge at Tiburon was raised, and
the fleet of the Corinthian Yacht Club, with some of the San Francisco
craft and several arks, was towed into the lagoon. The launches A.
C. McNeill, Envoy, Wildwood and Crescie lent valuable assistance
in towing the yachts into winter Quarters.
The following yachts of the Corinthian Club passed from thÂ© bay Into
the lagoon: The schooner "Wave, the yawls Nereid and Arcturus, the sloops
Edna, Emma, Rover, Aeolus, Truant, Mischief, Freda, Merope, Phanlcia,
Presto, AmigiJSStella, Belle. May, Clara, Ella, Halcyon, Wawona, Cupid.
Pleetwlng and Diana. The sloops Sappho. Juanlta, Thetis and Rambler of
"the San Francisco Tacht Club also went Into winter quarters. Several arks
are laid up In the lagoon,- among them being La Fiesta. La Paloma, Belve
dere. Edna, Utopia, Bohemia and Wigwam. The i sloops Nada: and Josie,
which are not on the roll" of any of the yacht clubs, took advantage of the
open bridge to enter the sheltered waters, where \ the pleasure craft will j He
protected from winter storms till April of next year.
The following yachts of the Corinthian fleet are still lying, at their moor
ings in the cove, and will remain there throughout the winter: Yawlsâ Spray,
Naiad and Seven Bells; sloopsâ Speedwell, Harpoon, Emllie, Doris and Doris
II. Mignon, Queen, Nereus and Neptune.' Ex-Commodore - George . S. Bil
lings' sloop Nixie is still at her moorings near the Sausalito ferry-slip, but
will shortly be taken up on Stone's ways at Tiburon, which are -at ; present
occupied by the sloops Pactolus and Mist of the California Tacht Club,
After the yachts had gone into the lagoon the yachtsmen went back Â¦ to
the clubhouse, where the rest of the afternoon was spent in ; storing away
in the loft sails, ropes, cooking utensils and cabin furnishings. Though the
yachting season has thus closed, the yachtsmen will continue to visit the
clubhouse on fine Sundays, while the rowing and launching members will
still follow their favorite pastime.
On Saturday night a party of : yachtsmen met In the San Francisco Club
house at Sausalito, where dinner was served, after which an Â¦ Informal
smoker was on the boards.

Handicap Tournament for the Davis
Cups Presents a Surprise on
the California Club
Courts. ; V
Â«
The tournament yesterday at the Cali
tornia Club for the Davis cups was won
by Paul Jones and John O'Brien, a new
team. They defeated the Whitney broth
*x> in the finals in straight sets.
**lay was commenced In the morning,
â¢with nine teams entered. The first match
was between Grant Smith and H. W.
Crowell vs. Merle Johnson and J. A. Code.
The latter team received four-sixths of 15.
Johnson and Code won the first set, 7-5:
Smith and Crpwell the next two and
match. 6-3, â¬-3.
J. O'Brien and Paul Jones gave Kuehn
and Joseph Mayhew 15 and beat them f.-4,
6-3. Mr. Dodge and R. Erskine defeated
Mr. Sperry and Mr. Worthington, 4-6, 6-4,
6-4, after a hard fight. George and Rob
ert Whitney gave W. B. Collier and Al
Rosengerg half of 30 and beat them
the best two out of three sets. 3-6. 6-3. 6-4.
Crowell and Smith gave David Painter
and Dr. Lane 20 and beat them, 6-4, 6-3.
O'Brien and Jones received 15 from Smith
and Crowell and beat them in a long strug
gle, 5-7. S-G, C-4. The Whitney brothers
ihen took on Dodge and Erskine, giving
them half of 40. The Whnneys won, 7-5,
6-2.
Two teams were left In the finals,
O'Brien and Jones and the Whitney
brothers. It looked like a walkover for
the coast champions and it would have
been but for the handicap. O'Hrien ar.d
Jones received odds of SO und l-<5 and won
by the score. 6-3. 7-3. 6-0. Th* losers put
lap a ramÂ« fight in the first two sets, but
In the last did not go to the net at all.
The winners are a young team and played
a 6teady game all through the tourna
ment. The tournament was the most suc
cessful doubles handicap that the club
has ever held, being especially popular
with the poorer players, who had a chance
to win first place.
San Francisco 7, Oakland 4.
Another home run by the red-armed
Mr. Held and hits that grew apace in thÂ«
latter part of the game when the San
Francisco team was working with the
stick were the features of an errorful
game on the Oakland grounds yesterday
morning. To counterbalance the fringy
fielding at times six double plays were
hatched as a setoff. . u
Moskiman was in the box for the Dudes.
For six innings he pitched exceedingly
good ball, but then the locals found his
underhand delivery and bunched hits in
scintillating packages. Fireman Fltz.
slab-worker for San Francisco, was at
his best after the first inning. Only six
times in all was he swatted. The score:

MORNING GAME.
When the ninth Inning rolls along and
the local team is on the diamond It la
pretty much of a certainty that a sen
sation will be sprung, even if Hank Har
ris and his nine performing pets have to
travel the circuitous path to reach It.
At Recreation grounds yesterday the
score was 7 to 6 in favor of the Dudea
and the local team, last at bat, were try
ing to Fhove runners over the plate. With
two men, whose epitaphs had been writ
ten, sent back to the bench and Krug
and Pabst on third and second. It was up
to Sullivan to save his team or die with
it. The usual howls and dinful noise were
let loose and, provokea by tue exhorta
tions of. the Frisco team, the small boy
fringe along the field fences began to
spread out on the grounds proper. Um
pire Hughey Smith ordered the Held clear
and called time. While this was being
done Krug and Pabst. in the realm of
"pipe" energy, rounded the bases.
Naturally Smith ordered -the men to re
turn to their bag positions. This provoked
several explosions of lingual wrath on the
part of Mr. Pabst and drew Uncle Henry
on the field. Hank oristled with many
kinds of anger and nearly shook off his
finger at the head of Mr. Smith. But
Hughey laughed at the absurdity of it
all and ordered the game to go on. This
was done. Sullivan cut huge s.ices in the
air three several times and the Dudea
came in on the jump with the single vic
tory of the series.
So plethoric were the errors that clean
fielding was provocative of spasms among
the fans. Francka* work at short was
brilliant and in glittering- contrast to his
diamond brothers.
The second inning gave a couple of runs
to both teams. Due to a couple of errors
by Brockhoff. Bowman and Logman, who
got a hit apiece, crossed the rubber. The
score was tied before the inning was com
pleted. Reilly was put on the Dags on four
bad ones and Iburg, by some careless
work of Lohman, 'who was oâ on an air
ship after Iburg struck at random at
three offerings, was safe at first. A two
bagger by Brockhoff scored both.
In the seventh the local team opened
with a two-bagger by Reilly and lburg
was brought into the bag-chasing on
Hutchinson's error. Tiien Unman went
bad at the plate when Brockhoff's
grounder to Hutch was sent .lomeward,
Keilly scoring. Later on an off-color
throw by Borchers to first anowed lburÂ£
and Brockhoff to score.
The eighth inning was all for the Dudes.
They hit Iburg three times and scored a
quartetâ Moskiman, Hutchinsoi;. Bowman
and Lohman â Drennan' s two-bagger being
responsible for the plate-scraping of tl>u
latter two. In the ninth the Dudes scored
once again, Moskiman getting the credit
of the run. This made the score what It
finally was.
The game yesterday was in sore need
of two attributes of baseball â policemen
to check the small boys' fence-jumping
and an umpire whose* eyes can detect a
ball that's a ball and a strike that's a
strike. The score:

UNCLE HENRY A
VERY BAD LOSER
There is much speculation as to the
number of bookmakers that will cut in
the first day and it now looks as if eight
een or twenty might hang out their sign.
Johnny Coleman. with his magnetic and
enticing smile, will, of course, be ready
with the chalk. Hoffman & Co. will prob
ably have two books on. Joe Harlan is
even now on the anxious seat. Al Ko
nigsberg. who rolled a shoestring into a
shoe factory around the Chicago track,
will weigh in and Tom Qulnn handles the
coin for him. "Peck" Eppinger, tired of
guessing from the ground, starts the sea
son with a bank roll that would give a
tramp the tired feeling to carry. Ed "Wal
lace is his block man. Henry Harris, the
baseball magnate and a well-known local
newspaper man will lay odds with a four
story roll. George Rose's crew is due to
day and George gets here shortly. A
Nome prospector named Mitchell will also
make his debut. Bert Cavanaugh, the
Sacramento politician, is going to have a
shy at the game. John Humphrey, of
course, is ready. Caesar Young and "Bill"
Langford. both now residents of Oakland,
are waiting to put their names down.
Tony Cook is another that intends chalk
ing prices. Fred Cook, the owner of an
extensive string of horses, and several
other bookies will reach here this week.
The local racing season will be Inau
gurated at Oakland track on Saturday
next and yesterday J. W. Brooks issued
for publication the weights for the Open
ing: handicap. In .past seasons this race
has furnished many a brilliant contest
and with the extraordinary long list of
entries a repetition of the same can bo
looked for this year. Kastern stahjes are
well represented, but as owners from the
other side of the hills have been dilatory
In arriving it looks as if the winner
might be picked from one of the Califor
nia strings. Handicapper Brooks had a
difficult task set before him in adjusting
the weights Â¦ on the sixty entries nomin
ated, still his work in the past has fully
demonstrated that he is capable of han
dling them.
The complete list of entries, with the
weights allotted, are as follows: -â Â¦ :
Opening handicap, purse 11500â A handicap
for three-year-olds and upward. Entrance, $10;
140 additional to start. The club to add an
amount necessary to make the gross value of
the race 11500. of which Â«20O to second and J1O)

Inducements are held out in the British
navy for gun crews to make good records,
and was appropriated last year to
be divided as money prizes for the best
target practice. The United States Gov
ernment Is somewhat niggardly in this re
spect, for our last Congress appropriated
only $12,000 for "gunnery exercises," em
bracing prizes for excellence in gunnery
exercises and target practice; diagrams
and reports of target practice; for the es
tablishment and maintenance of targets
and ranges; for hiring established ranges
and for transporting 1 to and from ranges.
No similar appropriation was made in the
preceding year, and after all the Inciden

from which prizes will be given to good

Hamburg are advertising in New York bonds to
the amount of $9,520,000 and the rate of interest of

the kind of prosperity we get under sound money. '
In a recent speech in New York Bryan said: "If I
am elected I promise you that within a year there will
not be a private monopoly in existence within the
United States." That is one of the promises that
Bryan might fulfill, for if he.be elected there will be
very little business left of any kind at the end of a
year.
The New York Herald urges the selection of New
England waters for the course of the next race for the
America's cup, on the ground that the course off New
York is too crowded with excursion steamers and the
winds are unreliable. Judging by the experience of the

PERSONAL MENTION.
Such expressions coming from Southern papers are
significant It is well known the South is rapidly de
veloping a diversified industry.' Her society is not
so subject to the "reckless imbecility of "arrant dem
agogues" as it was in the past. The need of 'labor
The Times says: "The secretary of the Convention
of the Commissioners of Agriculture for the Southern
States writes to the Atlanta Journal that six hundred
negroes have left Raleigh alone. The Observer of
Charlotte, N. C, while declaring that the negro as a
voter is a failure, says!, 'He has his uses as a farm la
borer, and there is no doubt that the farmers in some
sections of the State are sorely put to it for help to
pick their cotton crops. It is right to exclude these
people from the ballot, but it is suicidal to drive them,
by bad treatment, out of the State. 1 This seems to be
a confession that they have been badly treated, even
leaving the question of disfranchisement entirely out
of the discussion. The Raleigh Post warns the North
Carolina farmers that 'if this exodus keeps on,- these
landowners ~nd farmers will be in a worse condition
than they have been since the war, and will have no
one to thank for it save the arrant demagogues whose
reckless imbecility is only equaled by their unblushing
and selfish aspirations.' "
In the meantime there are signs that the question in
the South is about to enter a new phase. The more
energetic, industrious and ambitious negroes have
begun to emigrate from the States where they are
badly treated, and the effect upon the labor market
has already been felt. Thus we learn from a review of
the subject by the New York Times that the emigra
tion has given rise to considerable alarm among plant-*
ers and even in the cities.
That, of course, does not justify the action of the
Southern whites in violating the spirit of the consti
tution, defrauding a weak race of its rights and de
priving a certain class of American citizens of a priv
ilege they are entitled to enjoy. As Bishop Clinton
said: "It cannot fail to Jiave a bad effect to discrim
inate against the negro â first, because it bases citizen
ship upon color rather than on qualification of charac
ter; secondly, because it works an injustice upon peo
ple who have honored their right to citizenship in
every contest in which the nation's honor has been at
stake, whether on the field of battle or in obeying the
laws of the State and nation."
That is an excellent showing and gives 'reason for
the hopeful confidence of the country that the negro
race will rise superior to the obstacles in its way and
triumph over them. As a rule men and nations have
become strong solely because they had difficulties to
overcome. Every great race has had to make its way
to power by arduous battle and almost every individ
ual who^amounts to anything in life has had at some
period in his career to exert a strenuous force against
powerful opposition. Indeed, it is only by such con
tests that nations, races or individuals are made
strong.
"Despite these things, the negro is still making
progress along all substantial lines, especially in the
way of acquiring an education and accumulating prop
erty. As an example, our own church, the A. M. E.
Zion, operates seven educational institutions, one of
which owns fifty acres of land as a campus and build
ings valued at $125,000."
A NEW PHASE OF THE QUESTION.
T") ISHOP GEORGE W. CLINTON of the A. M.
\\ E. Zion Church, who is now in this city, has
* â brought from the Southern States a report
which, while it does not overlook the serious wrong
done to the negro race by the Democratic efforts to
nullify their citizenship, has in it much of good cheer.
After narrating what has been done to suppress negro
suffrage, the Bishop went on to say:
From every point of view the scheme is objection
able. It will benefit none but those who are appointed
to the new courts and thus provided with salaries at
the expense of the people and that class of people who
delight in litigation. The scheme is submitted to the
people under the title, "Senate constitutional amend
ment No. 22." .Bear it in mind and vote against it.
Even when all disputed questions concerning the
jurisdiction of the new courts have been settled, it is
probable the existence of the courts would lead to an
increase rather than a diminution of litigation. One
of the evils of our judicial procedure is the case with
which new trials can be obtained. Appeal follows ap
peal, and cases are tried over and over again even as
matters now stand, and the consequence is that ex
cessive litigation has become one of the most serious
evils of our law. Why provide machinery for abetting
and encouraging appeals? Why not so improve the
judiciary by the election of worthy Judges that th
decisions of the Superior Courts will be final in many
cases which are now carried to the Supreme Court
and ordered to be tried over again?
Whatever arguments may be advanced for tha
scheme are far outweighed by the objections to it. t
The creation of three additional courts will entail a
considerable increase in the cost of the State judiciary,
and the taxpayers will have to furnish the money.
The new courts will, furthermore, disorder the exist
ing judicial system, and for a time at least there will
be much confusion concerning the exact limits of
their authority. Every difference of opinion among
lawyers on that question will of course be taken to
the Supreme Court for decision, and consequently
that tribunal will have more instead of less work on
its hands.
HERE and there may be a taxpayer who will ob
ject to the designation of the proposed estab
lishment of three courts of appeal as a "tax
eaters' scheme," but the number will not be large.
The constitutional amendment providing for the crea
tion of such courts has been before the people a long
time, and very few persons have been heard to openly
advocate it. Some supporters it has, of course, or
it never would have been submitted to the people as
an issue to be voted upon, but their silence in regard
to it during the whole campaign is evidence that most
of them prefer to avoid discussion on it.
A TAX-EATERS' SCHEME.
. Business in this city continues satisfactory, and
probably as brisk as at any other point in the country.
The export trade of the port is making a fine record,
and the local demand for produce and merchandise
keeps up to its previous volume. Even the impending
election does not appear to depress trade as much as
csuaL Some farm products are quieting down, as they
always do after the bulk of the crop has been disposed
of, and when winter is at hand. The early rains have
been exceptionally beneficial, by starting the new
grass and the plows at the same time, and the farmers
generally are seizing the favorable opportunity thus
presented to get in their crops. Fluctuations in mer
chandise are average, and there is no general tendency
either up or down, each line advancing or declining on
its individual account Hence, while business is good,
it exhibits no particular feature calling for especial
comment
An interesting feature of the week was the an
nouncement that the gold in the Treasury Department
on Friday amounted to $451477,000, the largest stock
of gold in the world, and the largest ever held by this
Government. This in itself is.a pretty good campaign
document, at least among business men. A large
stock of gold means a large stock of prosperity, which
the country seems to have in abundance.
There was more doing in Wall street than for a
long time. A certain buying demand, which set in
at the close of the preceding week, gained force, and
with the advance of the week the public entered the
market, as indicated by the large puf chases of commis
sion houses. London also participated in the buying,
though Quietly. This new inquiry affected prices,
which developed more firmness in consequence.
The calling off of the coal strike was beneficial, not
enly to the immediate district affected but to the
country at large. Sales of wool continued better than
had been expected a few weeks ago, and the boot and
shoe and hide and leather trades continued active at
buoyant prices. Cotton ruled weak and disappointing.
There were no important changes in the iron and steel
trades, though it was announced that contracts for
steel rails thus far this year are within 50,000 tons of
last year's heavy bookings, and that the confidence in
the future is so ctrong that all raw materials are very
firm. The. wheat market continued depressed, though
there was a firmer feeling toward the latter part of the
week.
TRADE STEADY AND FEATURELESS.
r\ CCORDING to the country's bank clearings
f~\ trade last week was larger than for months, the
* * decrease from last year being only 2.8 per cent,
while some of the larger cities, which have hitherto
lost steadib', showed a gain. But there was no es
pecial activity in any line of merchandise, nor did any
section of the country report any marked increase in
distributive trade. The failures were 205, against 190
for the same week last year.

.From California there should go a solid Republi
can" delegation. Every district in the State should be
represented by a man who will be in favor of progress
,and prosperity, whose vote will be determined by con
structive statesmanship and not by a mere fanatical
opposition. The constituency that elects a Democrat
this year will be false to the interests of California and
neglectful of its own good.
The people of the Pacific Coast, and particularly
those of California, are going to have many great in
terests at stake in the developments that are to take
place during the coming two years. The trade of the
Orient is going to be full of wonderful possibilities for
this city and this State. Rival nations, however, are
eager to seize. upon every advantage that may be of
fered them in that part of the world. As a consequence
we shall have need of Government aid, diplomacy and
wise legislation to assist our merchants and manufac
turers in getting a rightful share of the rich markets
that are to be opened and developed there. How can
we obtain that if we send to Congress men who have
no other aim in politics than that of hampering the
Republican administration?
It is to be borne in mind the Democratic party has
now become something like a settled and organized
opposition to all progress. It has no policy of it*
own. A Democratic Representative could do nothing
for his constituents, even should he desire to do so,
and even should his party control the House, for the
party is hopelessly confused. Democratic candidates
in the East are almost without exception gold men,
who are opposed to expansion; in the South they are
expansionists who are opposed to gold; in the West
they are a little of all sorts and much of nothing. What
can be expected of a party so divided on every im
portant issue of the time?
progress and Governmental harmony.
.Should there be a Democratic majority in the
House of Representatives the progress of the country
will be blocked for two years. The legislation needed
to provide for the settlement of such financial issues as
remain, the wise adjustment of the fiscal system by
revision of the war revenue bill, the administration of
the Philippines, the upbuilding of an American mer
chant marine, the, construction of the Nicaragua'cana!
and a host of other important measures that cannot be
fully dealt with during the short term that remains of
the present Congress would be impeded, .if not alto
gether blocked, by a Democratic House. It would
mean two years of comparative stagnation and friction
in the Government instead of two years of continuous
THE CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS.
DURING the closing week of the campaign the
attention of Republicans should be directed to
the fight in the Congressional districts. The
Presidential contest is virtually over. A few Bryanite
roorbacks started at this time may have the effect of
disturbing the minds of those, who are easily influ
enced by every passing noise, but they cannot save
the situation. Bryan is beaten. It is by no means
certain, however, that the Republican's will obtain con
trol of the House of Representatives. That is the one
danger point of the contest and in every district Re
publicans should make a united and vigorous effort
this week to make sure of victory for the Congres
sional candidate. '
BY SALLY SHARP- â
Bryan has cut so many fantastic tricks in this cam
paign that this additional one will probably not have
much effect upon the minds of the people. Neverthe
less, men who have respect for the decencies of poli
tics, and the requirements which the dignity of the
high office of President of the United States imposes
upon every man who aspires to it, will note with a
deepening disgust this new evidence of the rapid de
scent of Bryan into the lowest depths of demagogy.
Fortunately the end is near at hand. We shall be done
with Bryan next Tuesday.
The Call is doing no injustice to Bryan in making
that statement. The report of his Madison-square
Garden speech, on Saturday night, as given by his
organ in this city, quotes him as saying on the subject
of trusts: "Mr. Hanna thrusts the question aside by
saying there are no trusts; and the National Commit
tee to-day is circulating a book written by Mr. Weeks
in defense of the trusts, to show that the trust is a
blessing and is here to stay. And last night, at the
banquet given to the Republican candidate for Vic'e
President, Senator Scott, who is vice chairman
of the Republican National Committee, and who
is in charge of the Eastern branch of Republican
headquarters, made a speech, in which he said: 'I
believe in trusts; they are a good thing. If it were no:
for the Standard Oil Company this prosperity we have
would not be here to-day.' "
Had the circulation of that story been confined to
the yellow organs it would not have merited notice,
but it has been taken up by Bryan himself, and the
country is thus presented with the strange spectacle of
a Presidential candidate making himself responsible
in a public speech for the circulation of a campaign lie.
"I did not say anything that could be construed to
mean what is implied in the published report. I did
not say anything resembling what I am reported as
saying. We were at .1, private dinner and no speeches
were made."
Such was the yarn published by the Bryanite organ
in New York on Saturday morning and telegraphed
all over the country to other Bryanite organs. Now,
see how simple a statement is needed to refute the
whole thing. Senator Scott, when interviewed on the
subject the morning the report appeared, said:
The launching of the canard has been accompanied
by all kinds of sulphurous yellow lights and tom-tom
thunder. We are told that when the Republican ban
queters realized the significance of the speech they
were panic-stricken; that they threatened the reporter
present with all kinds of terrible things if he reported
the words; that they bulldozed him into giving up his
"copj'," and that strong influences were set to work
to have the story suppressed by the Associated Press.
The most notable of the canards of the year was
launched from New York on Saturday morning in the
announcement that Senator Scott of the Republican
National Committee had made a speech at a banquet
to Roosevelt on Friday evening, and in the course of
it had said: "I believe in trusts; they are a goo-i
thing. * ? * If it were not for the Standard Oil
Company this prosperity that we. have: would not be
here to-day."
QUT of a long experience the American people
have learned to expect in the closing weeks of
a Presidential campaign the appearance of a
considerable number of canards from the Democratic
camps. These expectations have never been disap
pointed. This campaign is to be no exception to the
rule. The canard has made its appearance and the
sound of the roorback has been heard in the land.
A CANARD KILLED.

OPEN LETTER.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 27. 1900.
W. J. Bryan Esq., Lincoln, Nebr.
âDear Sir; In a few short days
you will be again a defeated can
didate and presumably have some
time at your disposal to devote to
your private interests. I under-,
stand that in your regular profes
sion a* a lawyer you will argue
a case for me If the fee is. satisfac
tory. I am willing to pay you one
Wiousand dollars ($1000) retaining
fee for two hours work and will
also "give another thousand (11600)
contingent on your success. You
are to debate with me on "Trusts."
You are to prove the remedy lies
In "destruction," while I will take
the stand that the only remedy Is
"public ownership"â otherwise, So
cialism. You can make your own
terms for this debate. I will meet
you In any city In America and
will pay all the expenses.
Now, Mr. Bryan, if you are a
.poor man and wish to earn two
thousand dollars ($2000) for two
hours' work you cannot ignore thib
offer. If you are a man of honor
and courage you cannot honorably
refuse to meet me and let the pub
lfc know .the strength of your
economic position. As to my
financial responsibility I refer you
to Bradstreet's or to any bank in
Los Angeles. This offer will be
open for acceptance any time
within one year from date.

on this stage there was a deep Impression made
on my mind that I cannot help expressing. It
is that looking at your bright faces I feel the
same as you do that there is power in your
order.. Some' things there . are that i>eople
never agree on. but there is no orte in thla
hall or in the whole world that can argue that
when young men bind themselves together to
lead sober and clean lives that there can be
ar-r wrong in it. There can be no two opin
ions on that. . Therefore there Is a vitality in
your work by your knowing that you are doing
right. This priest. Father Mathew, labored in
Cork alone, and yet we "rise up and call him
blessed." He was born in 1790. so we are a lit
tle late to celebrate the centennial of his birth
da v. He died In December. 1856. His great
work only extended over eighteen years, yet In
that short space of time he induced over 8,000,-
000 persons to take the pledge. His movement
first started In Ireland, eventually extended to
England, Scotland and America. AH of these
countries he visited to spread the good work.
When death caused him to lay down his task
It vas taken up by those he had impressed and
won over to his cause.
There is one Â¦word used to-day more than
any other and that is the word "environment."
Do you know what it means? It is used to
express the world we live inâ our surroundings.
1 believe that our lives are more Influenced by
our environments than by any other source.
Youne men should be brought up in temper
ance; so that when they become 21 and their
characters are molded, - they can resist liquor.
I do not mean that when you are 21 that you
should break your pledge; that Is not necessary
at all. In fact, I am sure that your chaplain.
Father O'Ryan, would not work and labor so
IN ELOQUENT DISCOURSE BISHOP MONTGOMERY IMPRESSES EVILS
OK INTEMPERANCE UPON GREAT. THRONG GATHERED AT PAVILION
TO HONOR THE MEMORY OF FATHER MATHEW.
Among the clergy who attended the
Bishop on the Dlatform were Fathers
Yorke, Brady, Hickey. Cullen, Quinn
Prendergast and O'Ryan. *
This treating habit Is a bad habit, and those
who indulge in it are slaves to public opinion.
Why cannot a man treat his friends to good
?laln water, and if he must give them some
thing else the ingenuity of man has devised so
many palatable non-alcoholic drinks that I
don't see why they can't drink them. In No
vember you are all no doubt going to vote, and
at the same time you are going to say "Down
with the trusts." Are you aware that the li
quor trust is the strongest of them all? It has
the wealth back of It and will never' be defeat
ed In Its work until we all organize and fight
it by organized strength.
English speaking people ar* Intelligent
enor^h to listen to reason, but why are they
so stubborn on this great question that con
cerns themselves? Every one should be a po
liceman of bis own principles â ha should be
cuardlan of the laws governing himself. I
wonder if . there are any old members of the
League here to-day that have dropped out of
the organization and that have not been equal
to the task of keeping the pledge? Perhaps you'
know soma who have violated their pledge. I
want to know if you think that they are money
in packet by doing so. Have they the more re
paect of â¢ their friends? You know very well
that they have not risen In your esteem.
hard in the cause if he thought that when 70a
came to your majority you would discard tem
perance. He will want you to so on aa good
citizens and sober men. It Is no use to talk
about temptations. You are right In your
conscience, right in your common sense, so
carry out your pledges.
There are two ways of keeping a man from
Renting: drunk. One is to shut him up In Jail.
The other way is to bring him up a model man.
Legislation has something to do with all things
of life, and it should have something to do
with drink. That is a question that we are
divided on; some people think that law should
prohibit the manufacture and the sal* of II
â¢iuor. The majority are not favorable to the
movement, and so we cannot expect to reach
a compromise.

First Regiment, League of the Cross Ca

marched into the hall and took seats on
the main floor, directly in front of the

introduced the idea of total abstinence
from drink and aroused the alarm against
liquor when the whole world was a weak
subject to its vice. The Just historian will
inscribe Father Mathew's name in the
THE greatest demonstration In the
cause of temperance ever held in
this city was that in honor of
Father Mathew day, which was
celebrated in the Mechanics' Pa
vilion j-esterdayy under the auspices
of the League of the Cross. Bishoi.
Montgomery journeyed expressly from
Los Angeles to deliver the oration to
the cadets, and his address was so elo
quent and his arguments so logical that
he is certainly entitled to the designation
"The Father Mathew of the West," which
was bestowed upon him by the Very Rev.
J. J. Prendergast, who Introduced him to
the vast audience. Between six and seven
thousand people were present at the Pa-
platform. Shortly afterward the Bishop,
escorted by a large number of the prom
inent Catholic clergy, ascended the stage.
The moment, the genial face of the Bishop
was recognized he was greeted by a whirl
wind of applause from the boys.
The celebration commenced with the
"Veni Creator," followed by a prayer and
a response by the Rev. Father P. 6'Ryan,
chaplain of the regiment. John J. Bar
rett was then introduced and- made a short
address. He said in part:
"It is the practice at the close of a cen
tury to view its work, and the names of
those who have abcomplished great things
are chiseled in lasting recdrds. "We are
in the final hours of one of the centuries,
and one of those whom we will ever rever
ence in our memories is Father Mathew.
He aroused England, Ireland. and Scotland
temple of fame."
At the close of Mr. Barrett's address
Thomas Green of the Tivoli sang a tenor
solo by Tostl. His selection was warmly
appreciated and the applause was so
deafening that before he was allowed to
leave the stage he had to respond to three
encores. The 'audience then sang "The
btar-spangled â¢Banner," accompanied, by
the regimental band. An ode. specially
written for the occasion by Merman Schef
fauer and set to music by H. J. Stewart,
was sung by S.J. Sandy, the chorus be
ing rendered by the cadets. ;
The Bishop was then introduced by the
Very Rev. J. J. Prendergast. Bishop
Montgomery said:

CELEBRATION OF FATHER M ATHEW DAY
PROVES A SPLENDID TEMPERANCE EVENT
The Rev. F. C. Sanford of St. John's
Episcopal Church spoke of human legisla
tion as differing from divine In not being
final or ideal. It registered public senti
ment and was governed by expediency.
Human legislation was Intended to serve
the best interests of the community. Ho
then referred to the proposed â¢ ordinance
for licensing poolselllng as not voicing
public sentiment, being: rather an attempt
on the part of the baser element In the*
city to obtain the advantage over the ma
jority and as dangerous to the welfare of
the community. It was the duty of every
Christian citizen to vote no. and not only
to vote, but to use his influence In every
legitimate way to defeat this nefarious at
tempt to make San FrandBCO a center of
unrestrained gambling:.
In Trinity Episcopal Church Rer. Fred
erick W. Cla.ropctt preached upoa
The razsbllnr mania Is certainly one of the
greatest dancers to which the young men of
our day Is subject. I do not expect the time
eoon to come when there will not be a class of
men Intent on getting money without an equiv
alent, or making their living by sport Instead
of by labor, but I do demur to the proposition
that this class shall govern our â¢ municipality,
and by their example mold to their Â»ktpg the
renexatlon In which we live.
I do cot remember to have met with a meas
ure (or the propagation of gambling more ua
blushlns and nefarious than this proposed or
dinance. I can not believe that any reputable
citizen, and especially any business man. can
support It If it la once fairly understood.
It Is raid that there will be gambling, ordln
as.ee or not. Tet we need not help It along.
We don't need to place open doors of tempta
tion. What Is this ordinance? Simply a li
cense for rambling. It grants certain privil
eges and advantages over law abiding citizens.
It reseaJs everything In the gambling line.
Horse racing bets, wagers on contests between
men: in fact, anything of the gamblers* craft
is leritlmatized by it. It increases the places
that tempt young men. The employers are al
wu-s on the alert, and many young men will
lose position" because of such an j ordinance
and must needs Join the unemployed, and final
ly the vicious characters of the community.
The Rev. N. Beard of Grace Methodist
Episcopal Church E&ld to his congrega
tion:
On our public highways and streets the doors
cf these tra^a would â¢evermore stand open
for the unwary. Children as they passed by
could see betting being carried oa: could hear
taJk of prize flg-hts ar.d horse races. Thf.
moral result to theM children would be cf a.
terrible character.
But gambling does not Etand as a single sin.
It stands for nearly every other sin. It cer
tainly leads, as the press gives daily account*
of evil-doing, chargeable Vu it. A young man
eamblee. Spurred on by hope of gain, he
epends ail the money (his by right) that he can
ecrape together. Sometimes he loses; some
time* and less frequently he v.-ins. In the
long run he loses. Then he takes hi* employ
er's money. Not perhaps in a bad spirit, not in
a. spirit of thieving, but fully intending to pay
back with Interest, lured on by the demon of
chance. He find* too late that he can
pot. Then cornea suicide, dishonorable flight,
or sometimes murder. This is what poolselling
results la. Ltt us unite to fight it.
Rev. Georpe C. Adams discoursed on
the evils of the poolrooms last evening at
the First Congregational Church, coiner
of Post and Mason Btreets. He took his
text from Samuel xviil. He dwelt on the
tiR-onizing sorrow of David over the way
wardness of Absolom and said that many
a father of this day had cause to grieve
also and to ask. "Is the young man safer*
He continued:
I wish to call your particular attention to
a pitfall which is perparing for our feet. I re
fer to the attempt which is being made to In
troduce ar.d pass an ordinance licensing pool
celling in this city. If 6uch an ordinance were
to come into force the result is terrible to con
template. An avenue to wrongdoing would at
once be openÂ«?<l down which our youth would
find an easy descent to Bin and evil-doing.
At St. Paul's Episcopal Church, at Cali
fornia and Fillmore streets, yesterday
morning, the Rev. \V. M. Reilly preacher
eloQuenuy against* a poolroom ordinance
before a large congreratlon. He aald,' in
part:
The adopting of such an Iniquitous ordinance
couid have but cr.e rt*ult. The poolrooms
flourishing under the protection of the law

" 'Out of some quaint and curious vo!Â«
ume of forgotten lore' the Board of Pub

spiratlon for Its being," said P. R. Bron.
son yesterday. "Ever since that body
was organized the people of the further
end of Howard street have been endeavor-,
ing to secure a slight favor which it
would not cost the city HO to grant, yet
they are as far from accomplishing their
end as" they day they Biarted."
At the corner of Twenty-sixth and How
ard streets an electric light is located in
such a position that Icb rays do not af
ford -light for the people on Howard
street. When the new Board of Supervis
ors took office a petition was sent to that
body asking that the light be placed at
the intersection of the two streets in
stead of down at one side on Twenty
sixth street. This was referred to the
Gas and "Water Inspector and after sev
eral months a recommendation was mada
that the Board of Public Works take ac
tion in the premises.
"When the matter reached the circum
locution office," said Bronson. "there the
matter was allowed to slumber. The vari
ous residents of this district saw a num
ber of the Supervisors, visited the Board
of Public Works and spent more time In,
endeavoring to secure the change of lo
cation of the light than the cost of th*
change would be If measured by their
earning capacity. -.â¢ '
"A letter was addressed to Supervisor
Hotallng In September, who promised to
see that the change should be made. This
was placed in the hands of Secretary
Park of the Board of Public Works, who
likewise gave his promise. Commissioner
Maguire's services were enlisted and more
promises made, yet the light stays In its
original position. If I had paid for the
removal of the lamp at my own expen3Â»
I am sure I would have been financially
far ahead." â¢ =
The proposition presented to the Board
Of Public Works In this instance was the
removal of an arc lamp from a point on
Twenty-sixth street, west of Howard, to
the intersection of the two streets. The
neighborhood is very dark 'at night and
now that the -winter seasort'ls approach
ing residents are anxious that an equit
able distribution of light may be - mada
on both streets in order to do away with
the dark shadows now cast and foil foot

"If It takes so Ions to get a lamp
moved," said Bronson. "how long will it
take under the present regime to hav*
some Important work done by the Board
of Public Works?"
As yet no one has been found to answer
Bronson's question.

The Rev. Peter C. "tforke preached at St.
Peter's Church - last night "on" the best
means of preparing for death. The dis
course! which # abounded with much ; that
touched the hearts of his hearers, was in
part as follows: '
There seems some â¢ strange fatality about
death. It would seem as if death Indeed loves
as the poet says, a shining mark.. The father
in the midst, of his family, the first-born, the
Dride of some home, or some- good and great
man. The . sands of life "are forever , running
down. '
There Is no escape. No matter what our
state, what our knowledge, it must come. Only
of one thing about it are we certain, Â¦ and that
la that none shall know | the day or the hour.
"I shall come as a thief in the night." If we
knew that on a certain day at a certain hour
we could go and meet fate, death would lose
its sting. .
ThÂ«ae who are entering life, those going
down life's hill, all must go out of the com
mon gateway of death. ""
Jesus is perhaps walking on the street now.
Some day. some night, he "< shall come . to our
door. He : shall come himself Â¦ and - the first .
warning we shall have will be when he stands
at our bedside. .'..--,Â¦Â¦.- _
After all, the object of life Is to prepare for
a good death. There is no better way than to
live a good life." One of the ways by which we
can begin to lead a good life is to constantly.

At the vesper service in the evening the
sermon was preached by Very Rev,
Father Prendergast:
It U even proposed to submit to ! the ; voters
of our fair city aj the coming election the
preposition whether - we - shall nave the suf
frue sanction of. the citizens of the city to
licensing gambling* on a wide open scale. For
that is what the passing of this Infamous or
dinance on poolrooms means. It Is couched in
the guise of "business." What sort of business?
The business of ruining homes, of destroying
manhood and womanhood, of making embez
zlers, '. thieves, thugs, : gamblers and Â» felons of
the worst sort It strikes at the business In
terests of San Francisco. It strikes at the
homes of Ban Francisco. It strikes at the best
elements la our new charter. It strikes at
The crime and sin of gambling- is one of the
curses of our are. Men all over the land are
being wrecked in body and soul through Its
agency, and the very thought that such a
monstrous sin should be legalized is a shock
to civilization, sot to speak of religion. There
are many representative men of this city now
listening to me, and I plead with them that
they will bring the total weight of their In

"The Evil of Gambling" was the theme
of Rev. H. H. Bell.- pastor Oi the First
United Presbyterian Church, last evening.
He said In substance:
The- history of gambling runs back ever the
centuries. Its history, is one not of blessing,
but of woe; not of truth, but of falsehood; not
of honeety. but of. dishonesty; not of better
manhood and womanhood, but of ruined man
hood-and womanhood: not of wealth, but of
poverty; not of virtue, but of vice; not of busi
ness prosperity, but of business failure: not of
lite, but of death . and death, too.- In Its most
horrible forms. ' "' 'iiHSBNt Â¦wi
righteousness as an essential factor of
true prosperity, both as applied to the in
dividual and the community. In dealing:
with the latter thought, he spoke with
deliberation and emphasis in regard to
the proposed gambling ordinance for the
city and county of San Francisco. He
said: '. >;
It is my duty a* the pastor of Trinity Church
t3 speak unfalteringly and boldly , upon the
Fide of righteousness. We live In a city In
which there Is the. marked spirit of material
prosperity. Those who know it best and have
lived here longest prophesy a brilliant future.
But this progress has its conditions. If the
floodgates of sin are opened by the so-called
legalizing- of this rambling- ordinance the step
of progress will be checked by a higher law
and divine which tells us that righteousness
exalteth a nation and that the lack of the
came will lead to debasement and humiliation.
Therefore, let every right minded citizen with
his ballot on election day strike, it down. - I>t
h!m who loves the. home and the family, who
loves honesty and common decency, who loves
truth and righteousness, who loves God and
man. who believes in purity and virtue, and
Â¦who loves this cityâ let him on election day

the middle of the fifth act. Edmund from
the lowest possible condition rises till he
is within reach of the highest. Ha Is the
shrewd mover of criminal Intrigue, and
accepts every opportunity that opens for
hi.* personal advancement His ambition
is at first content with small gains, but
as he secures one end after another he
comes to strive for absolute power. Hla
line of control crosses all the others, and
he thus mediates criminally among all the
other members of the play. First, he de
prives Edgar of his estate, then brings
about his father's banishment and the
confiscation of the estate. His Influence
tends to Increase every suffering and to
oppose every good. He crosses the Una
of Albany, and at Cornwall's death,
through Intrigue with bis slatersâ who
recognize their affinity In a person of
absolutely evil disposition â rises superior
act. This leaves the second and fourth
acts to exhibit the rising and falling
actions respectively. Tne ideal course of
a tragedy may then be represented by a
line laid upon the field of the play rising
from the lower level of zero to the
mechanical middle of the third space and
thence falling again to the level of the
beginning.
' Of course, inls Ideally perfect scheme Is
rarely maintained In practice. Variations
in Shakespeare are found of three kinds.
First the climax may occur earlier or
later than the middle point. This varia
tion at once changes the rising and falling
lines Second, the division Into acts may
not agree with the logical divisions of the ;
play. The function of the different acts i
may be transferred. Thus the introduction
may extend well into the second act. or
the* falling action may continue into the
field of conclusion. Third, the movement
of the play may not be a direct rise and
fall but 'the course of eventa may fre
quently be suspended. This variation may
be represented by an irregular line ac
cording to the irregularities of the action.
But In general the regular plat serves as
the form of construction. .-;Â¦â¢.,-
To Illustrate the course and relation of
individual players the tragedy of "King
Lear " which Is the most regular and con
sistent of all of Srtnkespeare's plays In I
point of construction, will be chosen for \
diagram. We draw again the fundament
al plan. Upon it we lay the lines of ac- i
tion As the action is here determined by ]
the history of the players before the in
cidents of the first act the scheme may .
include an indefinite field fronting the j
main map.
The diagram may be Interpreted both by
the relation of lines In separate acts and
by the course of individuals from the rise
to the fall. The four groups are estab
lished on the map according to the
primacy of their plots, and within these
plots according to their rank or assocla- ;
tlon with rank. Thus the king's group oc
cupies the upper -portion, of the diagram
and the Gloster group the lower portion.
Edmund, as an illegitimate son, holding
an Isolated place at the very bottom of
the field. This division coincides also
with the distinctions of plot and counter
plot Thus Kent. Cordelia and the fool
suffer with Lear: the other two daughters
and their husbands triumph together until
the separation of Albany from the forces
of evil. Edgar suffers with Gloster as
Edmund wends his way alone.
The play opens with Lear at the heicht
of his authority. As Kent and the fool
have been attached to the king's person
for many years, and as Cordelia has been
the King's favorite daughter, their lines
run parallel to that of Lear during the
time anterior to the date of the play. For
two acts Lear suffers deprivation of
authority. He is cast down from his king
ly position. Through the third and fourth
acts he loses control of his mental facul
ties He has descended to the lowest pos
sible estate. With his recovery of sanity
In the fifth act there Is a chance also of
restoring his kingly authority. His line
rises in suspense for the moment, but he
Is too weak and sinful for restoration, and
Nemesis demands his death In reparation
of a fatal error. * : M
Kent's fortunes depend, upon the
King. His bant3hment. his servile posi
tion, his suffering In the storm with Lear,
constitute his falling action. His line
then rises with that of the King, runs
parallel with it In descent for two act*.
A letter from Leadville discusses the sil
ver market, and incidentally comments on
the fortunate position of Leadville, where
there was lead to sell at $4 per 100 pounds
when stiver was as low as 60 cents. When
lead and copper dropped in price silver ad
vanced. Attention is called by the writer
to the fact that the silver market has not
been very erratic. Its rise and fall have
both been gradual. In January of 1896 sil
ver was 67%, and was about stationary at
68^ all through March, April and May. In
August. 1895. it began to decline, and
reached 64% in January, 1897, but dropped
to â¬0 In April. 1839. The present upward
movement is the first that has been sus
tained since the first part of 1S96. The
writer says:
It Is important to note In connection with
this advance that the price of the two metals,
lead and copper. Is very much higher than In
former years. The average price of sliver In
1S96 was 66 cent*, while this year It will be
less than 62 cents, yet at that time copper
was worth only 10 cents a pound and lead $2 75.
Copper began slowly to advance and was 17
cents In August, 1899, and Is now steady at
16 cent?. The average price of lead Is better,
consequently the intrinsic value of a ton of
ore In which silver, lead or copper Is an ele
ment, is much higher than at any time sine;
1860, when silver shot up to over a dollar. It
Is important to remember also that very much
lower grades of refractory ore can be handled.
Ores that went over to dump eight or nins

A meeting will be held at Redding, Shas
ta County to form an association of the
mining men of Northern California, to
send delegates to the State convention to
be held next month in this city and to
take such other steps as may seem best
to the miners of the north. B. H. Benja
min secretary of the California Miners
AÂ«sodation, has written to the Supervis
ors of Shasta. Trinity and Siskiyou coun
ties asking them to assist In making the
movement in the north a success. In a
letter to Mineral Wealth, published at
Redding Mr. Benjamin calls attention to
some benefits that have been derived by
the northern section from the visit of the
American Institute of Mining Engineers
to California, which was brought about
by the efforts of the California Miners'
Association. He writes that three invest
ments of capital in the mining industry of
California have been the fruit of the visit
of the mining engineers.
"One of the investments is in Slskiyou
County." he says, "and as consulting en
gineer for this company I am at the pres
ent time erecting a large cyanide plant,
and have given continuous employment to
some forty men since the 1st of July. I
have shipped In fifty odd tons of mining
machinery and have distributed many
thousands of dollars in labor and machin
ery in Slskiyou County, so I do not think
that any statement that the California
Miners" Association has brought no bene
fit to Northern California can be substan
tiated. I hope that Northern California
will have a large, energetic and ambitious
delegation in our next convention."
The discussion over the advisability of
establishing an independent smelter > for
Utah has some interesting phases. The
local papers are not united on the propo
sition. One argument that has been urged
scheme is to have a vessel outfitted at a
cost of 525,000, and he is to pilot it to the
alleged Alaskan treasure Island and to
receive the neat little sum of $75,000 for
his trouble and the secret that he imparts.
If the realization comes up to what he
predicts: otherwise he will not get any
thing. He has talked about miles of sea
beach that are very rich. The Los An
celea Herald Is authority for the state
ment that the treasure-seeking vessel
will soon sail for the Island.
The following facts came from the.
Calaveras Chronicle by the condensing
process: .
The Greek mine will soon be In operation.
It has a five-stamp mill, concentrators, hoist
ing works, etc. The Shenandoah mine Is Idle,
but will soon start ncaln. It has a ten-stamp
water i-ower mill. The ore Is of the ribbon
character. The Mauna Brothers' quartz mine
has been bonded to W. H. Rouse of Oakland
for four months on a working bond:. The Spar
rowhawk mine has been Incorporated. These
mines are In the Jesus Maria district.
The Trinity Journal reports that the
ditch constructed for the Last Chance
Mining" Company has been accepted. It
Is twelve miles long, has an average
width of eight feet on top and live feet on
the bottom, with a depth of four feet.
The mine is on the Trinity River, in the
Lowden ranch and Douglass City mining
districts, and embraces 1500 acres of au
riferous gravel. Several reservoirs will be
built In the spring and the mine will have
3000 Inches of water for ten months in the
year. An acetylene plant will be estab
lished.
The Amador County Democrat says:
Sargent's mine, en the middle bar of the
Mokelumne River, lying immediately south .1
tha Hardenburg, has increased Its force of
miners for the purpose of running a 700-foot
tunnel tc connect with a ledge of ribbon rock
From every direction on the mother lode the
outlbik for the future Is bright with hope
Among the l.nttst propositions where every
thing indicates a shipper is the Free American
mine, seven miles up the creek east from Sut
ter, managed by w. S. Weymouth. The com
pany has a good hoist and a new centrtfueal
pump that WttJ handle forty Inches of water.
The Baliol n.lnpi liave sixty-five men on the
day and' night shifts.
The Yreka Journal says:
The Greenhorn Blue Gravel Company No. *
working the Nehrbass place, received their
new pump this week, which Is now fixed up
for pumping out the shaft.
Mont. rf. the mineâ¢ are preparing for winter
operations, *o as to be ready when a supply of
water is furnished during the rain and snow
storms. At present there Is but little water
for sluicing to any extent, and the hydraulic
miners have bepn unable to pipe since July
The quartz miners have barely enough to keep
the mill batteries supplied. The Crystal and
Brown Bear mines on Whites Gulch, owned by
Cleaver. Swain & Newsome. have been clot>ed
clcwn for thÂ« winter months, owing to lack
oi water. They recently let a contract to
Jnmes Johnson to haul about 3000 tons of ore
from the mine to the mill,- which will be run
through os soon as the water supply permits
The Dewey mine at Squaw Creek is still sup
plying a carload of ore every day for shipment
from Gazelle to Keswlck. The late rains have
no doubt stopped all chances ' of any further
river mining this fall, especially ' In the south

against the enterprise by Salt Lake jour
nalists is' that " while there" is no doubt
about the successful operation of the
smelter there Is doubtwhether the product
could be as successfully marketed against
the combination, with which it would be
in direct competition. The Mining- Re
view, published at Salt Lake, says:
The Mining Review strongly tavors Independ
ent smelters and a competitive market; still,
it seriously doubts whether any combination
of capital for the building of an Independent
smelter ran prove successful for the reascn
that such a project will surely meet with the
opposition of the trust with Its Influence, its
millions and its almost absolute control of the
metal market. There can be no doubt
that an Independent smelter can be success
fully operated in this State; that an abund
ance of ore for treatment can be secured; that
treatment charges can be reduced and that
individual mine owners can be Induced to be
come shareholders In such an enterprise. This
; Is freely admitted and the times are ripe . for
the Inauguration and consummation oi such
a project, viewed from one side of the fence.
However, It' Is admitted that the trust con
trols the metal market; that It makes Its great
est gains on the sale of the product of Ha
smelters and refineries. This fact alone would
bring the Independent smelter squarely against
a solid, Impenetrable stone wall. It can pro
duce the bullion, but where can it find a mar
ket for it If the combine refuses to become a
party to Its sale? There Is the rub. A com
pany producing bullion which It cannot dis
pope of might as well go out of business.
The report Is given currency by the
Rarulsburg Miner that the dry diggings
situated about fifty miles from Rands
burg are paying well, and one company is
credited with taking out $7000 in two
months. Says the Miner:
None of the miners strip the ground, 'tlie
sand being shoveled Jn right from the top.
Pay dirt Is found In all of it and gold can 1>:
found throughout the entire section. Of course
a great deal of this Is fine gold, the coarser
gold being fount] nearer the bedrock. The
bedrock formation Is of two kinds. In some
places the miners stop work when they reach
a kind of bedrock formed of a mixture of
sand, gravel and a formation of volcanic clay.
The other Is a limestone formation, which in
all probability Is the real bedrock of the sec
tion, as the dirt Is found to be very rich
where that Is found. From . six pounds of
screened dust ' taken from a seven-foot hole,
"not ' selected," about BO cents In gold wan ob
tained, showing that the so-called bedrock
mentioned above" Is very rich and with the
proper kind of machinery could be- made to
give handsome returns. At the time the writer
visited the washing* about fifty men were dry
washing, some on their own ground and some
on leased ground. Two men. Murphy and
Fisher, were taking out about $15 per day.
Many others seen at work were doing better
than wages. When It Is figured that '> there
are in the neighborhood of 10,000 acres In the
section It can easily be seen that the ground
has not even been prospected yet.' There is
no question about the fact of gold being found
all over the ground : It is only a question : of
how to properly work It to obtain the fine
gold as well as the coarse. The dirt Is very
heavy with ; black sand so that no attempt - is
being made at present to save, anything but
the ccars* gold. Barstow is twenty miles from
the diggings.
There is a syndicate in Los Angeles, of
which the president Is reported to be a
wholesale merchant and several members
are connected with the banking business,
that has its origin in a scheme to fit out
a vessel to go to an Alaskan island to
mine for gold. . Thestory ; runs that a
sea captain (name not given) was ship
wrecked on: the island and there discov
ered that the sands were very rich. His

liildred was walking along Taylor street,
near Bush, at about 11 o'clock yesterday
morning. In company with her nurse,
when her father came along and took the
little one away. The nurse waited some
little time, and when Gray failed to return
searched about the vicinity for her
. charge, but could find no trace of her.
"She returned to the house, and reported
tbe matter to her employer. Mrs. Gray
at once set out to find her child, . and
pcoured the neighborhood until dark
without result. It was then that she re

Jennie McKown Succumbs to a Weak

Coroner Cole received a certificate yes

dison Huntlngton, 574 Folsom street, that
Miss Jennie McKown. 2711 Sutter street,
had died at his office Saturday night from
chloroform. The Coroner refused to elgn
the certificate and notified Captain Sey

The captain detailed Detectives Wren

they reported that Miss McKown, who

with the consent of her sister, Mrs. Bella
McCottrey, a trained nurse with whom
she resided, eone with her to Dr. Hun

an operation performed for a complaint
from which she had long suffered. Dr.
J. 1>. Hill. 1116 Sutter street, was called in
to assist in the operation. Chloroform
was administered to the patient and she
died, having, unknown to her sister, a
weak heart.
The detectives reported the facts to
Captain Saymour and he Instructed them
to take no further action in the matter.
The detectives could not find either Dr.
Huntlngton or Dr. Hill, but left word for
them to call at the Coroner's office and
explain the circumstances.
Drc. Huntington ani Hill called upon
Coroner Cole last evening and explained
the cause of death to him. The Coroner

The development of a given play and
the lines of its action may be represented
with a considerable degree of accuracy
by a system of -graphical Illustration, In
those cases at least where the Interest of
the play is derived from a general course
of events and from the careers of indi
vidual actors in various stages of compli
cation. Character, being qualitative, is
not expressed with the same fairness as
plot by any scheme of line relation, but
Inasmuch as action In Shakespeare is
usually the outcome of character it will
be found that character and plot common
ly coincide and the line that develops
action is also the expression of character.
The advantage of a graphical illustration
lies in Its directness and vividness. It
conveys a good idea of the architecture,
so to speak, of the play, and is a decided
aid to the imagination. The entire action
of a play may be held before the mind and
the lines along which the character is
supposed, to be moving have the same
meaning to the student of the play as has
a map of a railroad to a train operator.
A manager knows by a glance at a chart
the location and movement of each one
of his trains at a given moment. In like
manner It Is possible to construct a chart
of a play so that the student can know the
location and condition of a player at any
point In the dramatic process. The de
fect of any system of graphics Is, of
course, that a map of any kind is a mere
approximation of only one aspect of
truth, the external, but as a map of a
country Is useful to an economist or so
ciologist so its counterpart in spiritual
geography may be serviceable for Inter
preting psychical facts.
A Shakespearean play is divided more
or less mechanically into five main divis
ions and these subdivided Into scenes. In
a plat of a play the smaller divisions may
be Ignored and the acts only defined. Five
uniform spaces may be used to represent
the arena or field of the action. These
acts correspond more or less closely with
the logical progress of the play. Take for
illustration the course of tragedy. Tra
gedy Is the history of unsuccessful strug
gle. It Involves at least two permanent
conditions â struggle and suffering. From
a state of equilibrium a condition of con
flict Is evolved. The play proceeds from
conflict to conflict and concludes with the
downfall of the hero. With the disappear
ance of disturbing elements equilibrium Is
again established. This process requires
beginning and conclusion. The first act
will be devoted, therefore, to the Intro
duction- of the characters in action and
the fifth to their disposition. Between
these two points runs the course of the
conflict. For conflict two forces are re
quired, a moving force and an opposing
force. If the play Is ethical In motive
these forces will relate to what is evil and
good. In the first part of the play the
evil plotters will be triumphant, but there
will come a moment when the opposing
force has gathered sufficient strength for
active opposition. Opposition creates the
climax. This would naturally occur In
the mechanical center of- the play and Its
display would be the function of the third
THIRTY SHAKESPEARE EVENINGS.
W}th the main tragic story Is woven
the secondary plot of Gloster. The par
allelism of the lines of Lear Indicates
the general correspondence of their weak
ness and destiny. Gloster Is credulous
crosses It In the storm scene and meets It
again when Lear is recovering from his
madness. Then Kent rises suddenly Into
good fortune, but as his fate Is linked so
closely to the King his life Is forfeit, al
though he himself is guiltless oi any
grievous error. The fool rises and falls
with his master, but the stress of the
storm Is too heavy for bis gentle nature.
and he disappears at the middle of the
third act, the first to feel the effects of a
disordered world. In the clearance of an
ethical atmosphere by storm the Just may
suffer equally with the unjust In the con
flict of the elements. Cordelia waa closer
to her father than the other daughters,
and doubtless special favor had beea
shown her, but through her stubborn re
fusal to acknowledge the King's whim at
the opening of the play she Is utterly caÂ»t
down from the ro'yal place, deprived of
estate and driven abroad with the King of
France. In an alien land, however, she
gathers forces for her returnâ as we lefwa
from the letter read by Kent when in the
stocks â and during the time the other
daughters are stripping from Lear tha
last vestiges of authority she becomes
the chief agent of counterplot. She Is
permitted to meet her father at tha last,
and witnesses his restoration. Although
the French forces are defeated, the tide
of affairs turns for Cordelia at the last,
but It is for a moment and she and Lear
go down to a common death. While th*
members of this group are suffering th*
consequences of Lear's Initial error th*
second group Is rising Into place and
power. A discordant and disordered stats
gives Cornwall and the sisters their op
portunity for advancement into full con
trol of the kingdom. Under such condi
tions they become despotic and cruel and
generate suspicion and Jealousy. Corn
wall, whose marriage with Regan brings
a sudden access of power, assumes lead
ership, and Is the special agent for evil
through the first acts, but with equal
speed Nemesis descends and Cornwall's
death at the hands of one of his own ser
vants.who had been touched with remorse,
marks the climax of the whole action at
the close of the third act. At that point
the dominion of evil begins to weaken
and the gods begin to take part In ad
justing the disordered kingdom. Albany's
rise is rapid like that of Cornwall, but un
like Cornwall he Is possessed of a Â»enÂ»*
of Justice, and Is unable to enter Into bis
Queen's ambitions for usurpation. Ill*
line of destiny gradually withdraws from
the course of his group, and as the prin
cipal agent In thwarting the will of eri
doers and as -victor in the battle wltli
France, he Is made the deputy of all au
thority Inhering In the group and is one
of the two rulers who emerge Into the re
organized kingdom. Resan and Goneril
increase In authority and wickedness un
til the final stages of the play, when their
fate finds them out and they go down to
horrible death and punishment. Evil such
as theirs destroys itself, and their on
natural end Is what we should be led to
expect from the ethical condition* of the
play.

" Council of Sorrow " Exercises Held in the Pres
ence of a Throng of Warriors arid Palefaces.
BERKELEY. Oct. 2S.-In spite of the
fact that yesterday's score against the
freshmen !s a modest 5 to 0, the Berkeley
football men feel as sore over their defeat
as if the figures wore many times multi
plied. This is due to the spirit of abso
lute confidence with which the blue and
gold went Into the game. And this over
corfidence. in the opinion of the col
legians to-day, was the chief reason for
the unexpected defeat of Its boasted
â¢'baby eleven."
The California men expected an easy
walk-over and talked glibly of repeating
the famous 44 to 0 victory, and, ,ln this
frame of mind, faced the Stanford eleven,
whom even its supporters looked to see
badly beaten. The fierce rushes of the
Palo Alto youngsters completely discon
certed the Berkeley boys, who lost their
heads, played wildly at times or relapsed
Into a paralyzed state of uselessness as
the Stanford backs kept pressing them
Irresistibly. The line, which had held
firmly In practice, fell to pieces; the
backs, in the defensive game they were
forced to play all the time, proved totally
inefficient at supporting their line.
The Berkeley men are chagrined be
cause belief is still strong that their team
had the power to defeat their rivals.
Stampeded before the remarkable and
unlooked for strength of their opponents,
the California colts forgot all that had
been drummed into them by their
coaches. They used no judgment in choos
ing their plays; they failed to show even
the remnants of team work; they weak
ened in every phase of their play; Only
once or twice did they rally enough to
show the stuff that was really in them.
Athletic experts at the university have
thus to say regarding the defeat:
"The best eleven won," said Colonel
George C. Edwards, chairman of the fac
ulty athletic committee. "Our defeat was
due to their superior team. work and to
bad fumbles which we made. Stanford
made its gains by short plunges through
the line. We made larger gains at times,
but were unable to keep the ball, owing
for the most part to fumbles. I did not
keep count, but I believe Stanford had
the ball four-nfths of the time. There is
no question about it. the best team won."
Walter E. MageÂ©, professor of physical
culture at the State University, said to
night:
"The reason we lost was that the boys
did not play the game they knew. The
youngsters were scared to death. No one
was to blame for defeat; it was a case
of stage fright. The Stanford boys were
also badly frightened, but we were Beared
to death." Physically the boys were all
right; there is no question about It, they
were Stanford's equal physically. Xo one
could find fault with their condition. The
Berkeley team had more attention this
year than was ever given a freshman
team before. It is my firm opinion that
this is the best freshman team. Individual
ly and collectively, ever turned out at the
university. I have watched this team
carefully and I have watched the teams
ever since football has been played here,
and I believe truly that this is the best
freshman team we have ever had. Any
one who has watched the freshmen prac
tice and the games they have played
against 6trong teams on the campus must
say that we have a strong team. But
with Stanford we got the worst of it, I
am sorry to say."

Mrs. Rorer answers, in the Ladles*
Home Journal, an inquirer about good
complexion, reciting that it can only come
from a healthy condition of the entire
fystem and that it is not a matter of
outward application, finishing with the
ttatement that "your food cannot pos-
eibJy agree with you if you have muscu-
lar rheumatism and a bad complexion."
It is a known fact that many people
ftil to properly digest the Bt arcn y P art
of bread and other food. Grape-Nuts (a
delightful breakfast food) aro made of
the grape .sugar which results from pre-
paring the starchy parts of the cereals, in
the same way artificially as the body
should do by natural processes. There

HOTEL ARRIVALS.
There Is a picturesque Bide' to the quest
for petroleum in California. From Sis
klyou to San Diego the peculiar terms
describing the paraphernalia of the in
dustry - becoming familiar even to
children. Wells are sinking under the
heaving waters of the ocean, through the
depths of hills superimposed upon the oil
sands and in all possible sorts and condi
tions of places where the probabilities
appear to iavor a â¢"strike." Tne latest lot
ot contracts include one for the sinking
of a well in the bed of Lake Tulare.. and
operations will proceed thero under the
airectlon of the Tuiare ' l^ake Oil Com
pany. Time was in the memory of the
pioneers when Tulare L&ke was a navi
gable body of water of large size. There
is a possibility that many of them will
live to see tho lake bed decorated plenti
luliy witn derricks i'ria becoming a source
ot wealth. A striking laot :s that witn
the exception or the oil area in hos An
g-eies city the land that is producing oil
is not or value tor any other purpose. Tne
indusuy Is, therefore, an audition to all
previously existing sources of wealth in
the State and does not conflict with or
mterlere with any other, with the possi
ble exception of coal production.
Oil win supplant coal tor many uses.
There is an apiuslng siae to the early ex
periments in California to use oil as fuel..
J-Jonel V. Hedpath, in his recent work en
titled "Petroleum in California, " de
scribes a trial trip that was made by the
owners of the steamer Amelia on San
Francisco Bay with oil fuel. Captain
James Whitney, president of the Califor
nia Navigation Company, according to
Redpath's account, persuaded all the
stocKholders of his company to embark
on the Amelia, which was to make the
run around Mare Island experimentally..
That -was one of the most exciting experi
ments on record, for the steamer caught
tire four times inside of three hours, and
"there were several millionaires aboard
of her who were glad to get ashore alive."
Since then oil fuel has been so commonly
used for locomotion that there .is nat
urally wonderment that the former appli
ances to make it available were so crude.
As early as JS57 a trading scnoonev took
a barrel of oil sccoped up in' Ventura
County to San Francisco. The oil ex
citement of an earlier day died away,
largely because of the ignoranco of those
who owned the oil property. There Is no
doubt among the well Informed that the
industry iÂ§ now in its infancy in this
State.
An interesting calculation Is made by a
writer at Whittier concerning the pro
duction of fuel oil near Whittier. He
says:
'â¢Coal retails at Sll per ton Three and
a half barrelr. of crude oil, costing $3 50,
will furnish the same number of heat
units as a ton of coal. Whittier each
month produced oil equal in heat value
to about 10.000 tons of coal, worth $100,000."
The same reasoning applied to all the
producing oil tields of the State would
have interesting results.
The Standard Oil Company is Â¦ erecting
four of its 35,000-barrel storage tanks in
the Kern field and will soon be ready for
business there.
A water company has been organized to
supply water to the Sunset, district. It
has a fifty years' lease on a number of
sources of pure water in the mountains
which are supposed to be sufllclent to.fur
nish all the water that the, district will
require.
Oil litigation continues. The Kern, Kern
River, Aztec and Elwood Oil companies
and W. A. Jacobs are defendants In suits
brought in the Superior Court by T. J.
Kelly. H. E. Brett. D. C. Narver. L. T.
Clemens,Â» Charles Ashton and others as
the outcome of proceedings in the Visa
liaLand Office. On the land Involved are
good wells. The plaintiffs allege that they
located the land last September. Accord
ing to the Bakersfleld Callforhian, the
proceedings rest upon a technicality,
which is referred to as follows:
The point Is this: That before oil was struck
the original locators deeded their Interests to
a corporation, the Kern Oil Company, and the
discovery later. If It reverted back, must have
reverted to the locators only; but these having
signed away their rights were uot In a position,
to derive any benefit.
The canal companies in Kern County
have written a joint letter to the oil com
panies operating north of Kern River call
ing attention to what the canal men be
lieve to be a menace to them. Thex set
forth that unless steps are taken to pre
vent it quantities of waste oil will be car
ried from wells to the Kern River or the
irrigating' canals using the. river water,
causing great damage to the irrigated
lands and the crops growing thereon.
Some of the oil companies will burn their
waste and prepare to prevent any leak
age.
Douglass, Wyo.. has the oil fever, and
there nre oil strikes reported in Colorado,
The Wyoming oil is a heavy lubricant,
and the projectors are talking about a
value of $S per barrel for the product. ,
The Los Angeles Herald says:
The Pullerton correspondent to a local paper
Klves the number of produclnr wells in the
FuSlerton field as 2P0. the numbÂ«r of wells be
ing drilled as l"0 and the dally production aa
10,000 barrels. This statement the corresiiond
ent will doubtless correct after he has made
a canvass of the field. The number of prnduc
lnK wells in the field. Including the Brea Can
yen group, is forty-nine, and the number of
wells drilling- Is about twenty. Including the
Puente OH Company's wells, which are as near
the Whittier as the Fullerton field, there nre
1CS producers and twenty-four strings of tools
nt work. Assuming that the well* are averag
ing fifty barrels a day, which Is a large esti
mate, the output of the Fullerton field proper.
Including Brea Canyon, would be 2450 barrels.
Adding to this the Puente wells the dally pro
duction would be E2S0 barrels, at the lame
average per well. The entire district, includ
ing the Fullerton, Puente and. Whittier tields,
would fall short of the statement of the cor
respondent. The production in all these fields
is Increasing, howew, and that the daily out
put of the Fullerton . field alone will before
rnnny months exceed 10.000 barrels is beyond
question.
It Is reported that a contract has been
closed for the delivery of 15.000 barrels of
Kern River oil per month In L.os Angeles.
That Prospectors Are TJnremit-
V ting in Their Quest for
Petroleum.

Gordon's friends -in the company deny
that. he was-lnany way responsible for
her attempt on her life, and say that it
was a case of misplaced affection. She
has attempted to secure a divorce, but
has so far been unsuccessful.
Mrs. Tomlinson was hysterical after her
arrival at the Receiving Hospital and
could give no reason for her act. She ad
mitted to be'ns? 42 years of age and having
been marr.'ed to a man named Frank Tom
linson some years ago. She became enam
ored of a man named Jules, leader of an
orchestra In a Boston theater, but as she
was. unable to secure, a divorce from her
former husband seemed to pine over the
matter. Twice before she made similar
attempts, with results as unsatisfactory
as that of yesterday.

best of accord. -..>.->'
When the actress appeared on the stage
yesterday afternoon no one suspected that
she had designs on her life. She went
through her part with her usual sang

a different version to tell. Some say that

other member of the company enjoyed his

later removed to the Receiving Hospital.

Just what led to the attempt at suicide
is not known. In Mrs, Tomlinson's room
were found a number of pieces of senti
mental poetry having no connection with
the case. Her name has been coupled with
that of James Gordon, who plays the part

A scene of rlojt and disorder character
ized a meeting of the Chinese at- the head
quarters of the Six Companies yesterday.
Nearly 400 heathens, wildly gesticulating
and uttering threats, required the atten
tion of the police, and for a time it ap
peared as if serious trouble would Hbsult.
The clash was between the Six Compa
nies and the Chinese residents, who claim
the officers of the former were trying to
blackmail them.
Recently, it is alleged, the president of
the Six* Companies issued a proclamation
to the effect that all Chinese leaving this
port for China must secure certilicates
indorsed by him,- and. upon their, arrival
In their native land should employ an
attorney who , would testify as to their
pood character and intentions upon being
shown the certificate. The Chinese say
that the fee3 for this so-called "protec
tion" would amount to about J300. A fail
ure to do this, the proclamation read,
would cause the traveler to be identified
as a. Boxer and executed:-
The Chinese residents demurred, and
the cry. of blackmail was raised. They
uttered ugly threats against the officers
of the Six Companies and the meeting
yesterday was called to adjust the mat
ter. â¢ - Â¦â¢Â¦:Â¦.,.-â¢.. ..
. Those who attended the meeting came
prepared to make trouble, and the officers
of the Six Companies were . escorted to
the hall by Policemen Robert Connor and
M J. Cooney, Their appearance was tho
signal for the outburst of dissatisfaction,
and additional policemen were summoned
and charged the. crowd several times to
prevent violence .being done. senti
ment was so strong against the officers
of the Six Companies that they finally
withdrew the proclamation and the mob
dispersed. â¢

with opium smuggling in San Francistfo.
with opium joints, white victims of the
"pipe habit."highbinders. Little Petes and
the rest of It, and is interspersed with
clever vaudeville turns done by really
clever vaudeville artists; but of reaso'n
able plot there is none. There are many
clever folk on the programme. Mazji
Molyneux as Maggie Peck has a joyful
comedy sense and does an excellent turn.
Laurette Cooney is a brilliant, vivaciousâ
slightly too vivaciousâ young damsel of
the soubrette type. Fred Douglas as the
"opium king" does the heavy villain in a
satisfactorily ponderous fashion, and Wan
Sing, done by Louis Morrell, is a good
though not inspired portrait of the Chi
nese highbinder. George A. Weller as
Ironsides is only indifferently satisfactory.
He rants to wearinessâ the part perhaps
demands it. Miss Lizzie Mulvey does a
Easterner; but the humor Is largely un
conscious, or the .authors are cleverer
playwrights than is apparent at a first
glance.
IT Is to laugh at the Alhambra Theater
this week, with "The King of the
Opium Ring," by Charles E. Blaney
and Charles A. Taylor â to laugh with
every risible thread afforded by un
generous nature, at the delicious absurdi
ties, joyous impossibilities and hilarious
hurly-burly of this beautiful Oriental
hash.
The plot of the play is a nlc<Â» combina
tion of Laura Jean Libbey, Nick Carter
and a dash of Charles D. Hoyt, as the au
thors program ma tically confess. "No at
tempt has been made to Introduce high art
find moral teachings. While upholding the
virtue* of the sir.ner, rare has been taken
to <iis<-ouraee vice and ofFer no offense to
morals. To instruct and entertain is its
whole object."
In the latter purpose the play succeeds
admirably â ore is entertained almost to
?â¢xtlnrtlon. and the instruction Is probably
inoffcr:HV.?ly intended for the unwary

At the Columbia Theater to-night Stuart
Robson begins a two weeks' engagement
with his latest comedy success, "Oliver
Goldsmith," especially written for hlnrrby
Augustus Thomas. It Is understood that
Mr. Robson's conception of the genius
who "wrote like an angel and talked like
poor Poll" "is one of the best in the clever
actor's repertoire, and that the play ranks
with the author's "Alabama," "Arizona"
and "In Mizzoura."
"For Her Sake," "the most powerful of
aii Russian melodramas," according to
the programmes, opened Its run at the
California last evening to a crowded
house. It was a pleasant crowd in the
balcony and lower floor, but an unpleas
ant one In the gallery, .which caused the
leading man to pause long enough in the
third act . to reprimand a few noisy
persons who persisted in adding their
comments to the text of the piece. While
there is no villain in the play, the play
is full of villainy, and what seems to be
the villain is not unmasked until the
fourth act. when he turns virtuous under
the arguments of a lady in green velvet,
and undoes all the mischief he thought
he was doing. The acts are full of shiv
ers, and it needs not the setting of stage
snow in the last to add to the chilly ef
fect. There are plots enough to run
through four acts more, and counter plots
sufficient to build four more upon, but
dramatic limits must npt be overstepped
and so the whole is crowded into a
quartet. The leading lady is. sold as a
slave In the first act: there is a man
killed in the second, by mistake, however;
the hero and heroine are sent to Siberia
in the fhird. through the machinations
of the hero's mother, and it takes the
whole of the fourth act to. catch them
on the read to the mines and rescue them
from the frozen scenery. The hero, Prince
Vlademar Radesky, is portrayed by. Irvin
Blunkall. who is good. He made his best
hit Â¦ when he "called .down" the gallery."
The heroine, Olga is her name, Is por
trayed by Lyllian Atwood, who deserves
the big type she is awarded in the pro
gramme. The support is good.
fine buck and wing dance. Barbara Doug

their ungrateful parts, and Frank B.
Hayes Is a good enough Oriental as Hop
Toy. Some excellent gymnastic work Is
done by the Wilson brothers, and the Dale

"Walter Jones to advantageâ add largely
to the Joys of living.
