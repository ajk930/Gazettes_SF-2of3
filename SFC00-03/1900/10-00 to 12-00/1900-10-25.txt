campaign the fact that ,the two young
people were almost constantly In each
other's company was overlooked to tho
extent that It provoked no great com
ment.
One day Anita" discussed the political
issues in .the. presence of her father and,
warmlng/up to her subject, she so far
forgot herself that she produced a placard
bearing the ' announcement of the candi
dacy of Hull 'McClaughry.

out to be a bad move on her part and
last Sunday's secret journey may- be
traced to this particular Incident,
"Lucky" Baldwin, In bygone days, has
mixed in politics In Nevada and was al
ways counted on as a stanch supporter,
financially and otherwise, .of the'Republi
can party In that State. "While figuring
on hl9 trip to Nome, "Lucky" one night
was sitting with a* number of men\who
were anticipating -a trip to' the northern
gold fields and the subject turning to poli
tics for a moment brought forth the story
of the finale of Anita's political ambi
tions.
The old miner told how he had suspect
ed his daughter of being In -love with a
young lawyer Just striking out for him
self Â¦ and ' said that the marriage with 'his
consent was' Impossible." He related how
she had "sprung", her 'sweetheart's pic
ture on him "simply for love of politics"
'and In the warmth of hU story told bow
his j political pride had 'been hurt by his
daughter's action In covering the card of
his llf e-long .. Republican friend who was
"out for office too," : with the Â¦ placard of
a > sprouting ',> disciple - of Blacks ton*, * who
had never been heard .of and a Demo
crat at that, ,.".'..Â¦.

Claughry Is anxious to get started In
housekeeping : as previously planned. ".
The young couple had been engaged for
nearly a year, but an obstacle, to wit,
one husband, ' prevented an . earlier con
summation of the marriage. Mrs. Mc-
Claughry had first to" sever the legal ties
which bound her to George W. Baldwin.
While she claimed that on account of her
husband's continued desertion fcr the past
two years a divorce could be easily ob
tained. It required ) the greatest skill and
cunning on the part of her attorney lover
to keep the, fact that she had asked for
such a decree from the world In general.
At last, however, by an overazirlous ef
fort on the part of the clerk of the court to
help McClaughry keep the affair quiet the
secret was told. But even then no one
suspected i that; the : fair Anita's, object in
being' released from the one bond was to
pave the way for the tying of another.'
" Feared Her Father's "Wrath.
Friends 'who know something of the af
fairs of the Baldwin family say that
Anita feared her father's wrath^ more
than, public opinion and that It was for
that reason her desire for secrecy was
so great. . ; : { ,; ?

that Anita first learned, to love Hull Mc-

Mr. Bryan at Mllford spoke at length
of the trusts and took strong grounds In
support of an income tax. declaring that
such a tax was more just than a levy
upon land. The tax upon land alone must
be ..paid whether the land produces -or
not." Â¦ ..'.
"But." he continued, "if you think i a
Republican farmer can escape justice, you
try It. Let some Republican farmer go
into the. store to buy sugar and. when
they want to charge him more. Just let
him tell" the merchant that he Is a' Re
publican; that he Is the best friend of the
trust; that the trust could not live but for
him, and then see if he does not have to
pay an increased '. price. The merchant
will tell him that the trust Is like the Lord
In the. one respect that it Is no respecter
of persons and a Republican has to pay
Just like anybody Â«?lFe."
Addressing' himself to the agricultural
community, Mr. Bryan said that If the
farmers could arrange .sorno way so that
a Rppublfcan farmer was not the victim
of a trust, then the Republican farmer
might be Indifferent to the sufferings of
his Democratic neighbors.

NINETEEN SPEECHES BY BRYAN
"Mr. Bryan has been about denouncing
our little regular army, our gallant little
army, and as a leader of that kind always
draws followers. Mr. Bryan has had ad
herents who have gone about this State
repeating slanderous falsehoods, which
they knew to be slanderous, falsehoods
when they made them, that our army In
the Philippines wasan army of murderers
and ravlshers: that it had been doing foul
wrong there. Mr. Bryan has said that the
purpose of creating the present army was
to put it in force near our great cities to
overawe the workingman. I should laugh
at that statement il i my. blood did not
burn with Indignation that any man
should make It and yet be a candidate for
the highest office in the gift of the Ameri
can people. That army was voted for not
only by Republicans but by Democrats.
Half the Democrats in the HouÂ«k> voted
for it, the Kansas City convention had
not yet made dishonor -of the flag one of
the cardinal principles of their policy, and
I will guarantee that not one single man
ef them dreamed of such a purpose when
he cast his vote. The thing is monstrous
and absurd on Us face. The army was
created to meet the exigencies of the
Spanish war and the struggle that suc
ceeded the Spanish war. As a matter of
fact, the army is not In this country at
the present time. For the last three years
the army has been a terror, to the'Span
iards, the Aguinaldoan Malays, the Chi
nese Boxers, and In this country only the
sympathizers with those classes have had
cause to feel uneasy about it."" *
With the exception of a short trip of
half an hour to Herklmer, where a brief
address was made, the culminating
speeches of the day were at two Immense
meetings in this city. Senator Depew.
preceding the Governor, spoke at some
length on trusts. Governor Roosevelt fol
lowed and said:. â¢ * .
There was a preconcerted attempt at
Rome to compel Governor Roosevelt to
answer questions concerning the letter of
Mayor Van Wyck, the 'prosecution of (he
ice trust, the prosecution of the alleged
<fanal thieves and others relating to the
office of Governor. That this attempt was.
preconcerted Is assured from the fact that
men in the crowd asked . questions, hold
ing in' their hands printed slips, kndupotf
their "failure to compel the. candidate to
answer numbers of these slips were
thrown into nis carriage. The Governor
positively declined to make any expres
sion of opinion as to the circular? or their
authorship, or to answer any of the ques
tions contained in them.
In this city to-nisht instead of speech
making the clay's work ended with a view
of an immense demonstration. This was
entirely agreeable to Governor ROosevelt,
who during the day had made nine
speeches, some of them extremely long
ones, vrhlle traveling throuph three coun

hotel. Though they had long been en
gaged the young lovers deemed It ad
visable not to mention the fact to the
father of the bride-to-be, as he had often
forbidden Anita having anything to do
with her cousin. Once when she pleaded
with her father she was toUl that she
must cut. off acquaintance with him at
once and that if ~he did marry him she
would be disinherited.

who was one of the honorary pallbearers.
From the White House conservatory
there was sent' a heavy wreath of. white
roses and orchids. The â¢ British Legation

WASHINGTON, Oct. 24.â An Interesting
report upon the conditions In \ Dawson
City and the Yukon district of Alaska has
been furnished to the State Department
by United States Consul McCook.
"Dawson to-day," he says, "presents . a
marked contrast to; the Dawson of 1898.
Then no one except possibly the Judges
on the bench wore a white shirt. The
town t was thronged with miners", pack on
back," prospecting . for gold. The streets
were veritable mudholes. Now people
dress much as they do in the cities of the
United States; a man with a pack on his
back Is an unusual eight, and one can
walk the town over with polished shoes
and not have them soiled."
' Dawson City does , not appear like a
mining town, states Consul McCook, but
rather a thriving commercial center. It
is crowded Just now, - for . more come In
than go out Electric railways are prom
ised by 1901 and public schools have been
opened and are well attended. .
The Government at Ottawa, It Is report
ed, will offer for sale at public auction In
Dawson City every claim that has revert
ed to It by lapse or otherwise, and thirty
days after the time of sale 'air claims not
sold. will be declared open for location.
.The output of gold- has been. Increasing,
says the Consul, In spite of the fact that
the average values of the gravels worked
have been steadily, declining, the richest
mines having been .worked first. But
meantime the cost of - working Â¦* has ' de
creased and enables properties to be prof
itably worked now, that would ; not nave
yielded . gains â¢ two years â¢ ago. ; Â¦ There
should be a continued output of from $15,
000,000 to $20,000,000 worth of gold annually
for r many years â¢ to come, . according- . to
Consul , McCook, if the â¢ expenses . of work-
Ing are further reduced. â¢ * Â¦Â¦ . â¢ '

FEAR THAT
MAGAZINES MAY
HAVE EXPLODED
Indian Head Naval Ordnance
Proving Grounds May
*Be Destroyed.
CALL BUREAU, WELLINGTON HO
TEL, WASHINGTON, Oct. 24.-H Is fear
ed that a disastrous explosion has taken
place at Indian Head naval ordnance
proving grounds, about twenty-six miles
below Washington, on the Maryland side
of the Potomac River. A conductor on
the Baltimore and Potomac train arriving
In Washington late to-night reported at
the station that he had been told by rail
road employes at Woodbrldge and Quan
tico, Va., that they had heard a loud ex
plosion in the direction of the proving
grounds and had afterward seen the light
of what seemed to be burning buildings.
A telegram received by railroad officials
from the operator at Quantico at 1 o'clock
said that an explosion had taken place at
about 10:30. The operator said that the
buildings were still burning and that other
explosions had followed the first one.
There Is a telephony, line from the
Washington navy-yard to Indian Head,
but the office at the yard has been unable
to get in communication with the prov
lmj grounds, and it is believed that the
explosion has destroyed the building in
which the instruments are located or In
terrupted the line. All powder made else
where for the navy is tested at Indian
Head, and there is usually more or less
powder on hand that has been sent for
test purposes. There Is also powder in
the magazines for conducting tests of
guns, projectiles and armor plates. Mag.
azines were located, with reference to con
fining an accident within as narrow limits
as possible. There are about a half dozen
officers stationed at Indian Head. The
last naval register shows that the officers
on duty there were: Lieutenant Joseph
Strauss, inspector In charge; Lieutenants
(junior grade) Slmon^F. Fulllnwlder, Rob
ert W. Moneeiy and Walter S. Turpln; As
sistant Surgeon Henry A. Dunn and Gun

BIG CONTEST
FOR CONTROL OF
PACIFIC MAIL
Struggle Engaged In by
Four Transcontinental
Roads
Southern Pacific Buys the Stock Lib
erally in Order to Retain the
Interest Held by the Late
C. F. Huntington.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 24.â Wall street heard
to-day the interesting story of the acqui
sition by E. E. Harriman ajid friends, in
cluding- W. K. Vanderbilt, of the control
of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company,
one of the properties with which tlje
name of the late <"oll!s P. Huntington was
most closely Identified.
The stock has been heavily bought late
ly and its activity appears to have given
rise to various reports about the change
of control. Although Mr. Harriman has
really bought a block of the stock, the re
port that Mr. Vanderbilt was interested
In the purchase is emphatically denied.
"I know of no fact. * said Charks H.
Tweed, who is an exveutor of Mr. Hunt
ington's estate, "to substantiate any such
report. A good many months ago. when
there was considerable activity in Pa
cific Mail. the report was spread that the
North German Lloyd was buying the
stock. That simply proved to be a stock
jobbing tale. I know of no change in the
Pacific Mail's control."
Mr. Tweed declined to say whether or
not Mr. Huntington when alivo controlled,
with the aid of his friends, a majority of
stock.
Mr. Harriman is now in the West.
When questioned as to his Pacific Mail
d'-al to-day he declined to discuss it. It
Â» â¢ ~.<I not he learned how much stock he
baa acquired. It was ascertained, how
ever, that James J. Hill of the Great
Northern Railway Company is Interested
with him in the deal.
The Mail and Express says that four
transcontinental railroads are fighting to
secure control of the Pacillc Mail
Company and that the contest is going
on in open market. This tight is said
to be among the Atchison. Union Pa
cific. Missouri Pacific and Southern Pa
cific companies to obtain absolute con
trol of the steamship company. To this
end it Is faid that the Southern Pacillc
hap been a heavy buyer of Pacific Mail
stock recently in an endeavor to retain
the h<-s!d on the property which it had
through Mr. Huntingdon.
CHICAGO. Oct. 24.-E. E. Harriman.
head nf the big railroad buying and con
solidating syndicate th.it bears his name,
arrived in Chicago to-.iay to confer with
the attorneys cf the Kansas City South
ern and President Veitm of the Alton re
garding the future management of the
former line and to discuss the recently
formed traffic agreements of the Western
roads.
Just what the syndicate intends to do
with the Kansas City Southern is not
known. The rumor that this line is to ba
consolidated with the Illinois Central and
Union Pacific, all Harriman roadsâ a**
the whole operated as <.ne system, is gen
erally believed by local railroad men and
financiers. It is said lhat several of the
new owners of the Kansas City Southern
are against any con^ol'dation scheme on
the ground It would tend to reduce
earnings of the various roads in the Har
riman combine. By maintaining inde
pendence the roads would be In position
Â¦ to enter Into arrangements with connect
ing lines not owned by the Harriman peo
ple. If the roads under the influence of
the latter were brought together as one
system the other lines would combine
against the syndicate in competitive traf
fic.
During the day, it Is said, Mr. Harri
man met with the presidents of big
Western roads operating west of Chicago
and discussed rates and traffic organiza
tions at length.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
(CALL BUREAU. WELLINGTON HO
TEL. WASHINGTON. Oct. 24.â No eur
prtse would btÂ» expressed here should
Secretary Hay la hie response to the
British and German governments regard
ing the Anglo-German agreement, make
another effort to induce all the powers of
Europe to join In an agreement for the
maintenance of the Integrity of China and
the preservation of the "open door."
. The Secretary led the way up to such a
proposition by his reply to the French
note respecting the basis of negotiations
to be adopted. He then stated that the
"Oovernment of the United States be-
Jieves the happy Influence upon the de
termination of the Chinese Emperor,
which the Government of the French re
public anticipates as a result of this step,
would be 6till further induced if the pow
ers were to Include, as part of their init
ial declaration, collective manifestation of
tneir determination to preserve the terri
torial integrity and tne administrative
entirety ot China and secure for the Chi
nese nation and for themselves the bene
lits of open and eiual commercial Inter
course between the Chinese empire and
the world at large."
It is believed were that France and Rus
sia will not decline to join in such a mani
festation, and in view of the reiteration of
the principles of the integrity of China
and the "open door." it is not regarded as
possible that the London and Berlin gov
ernments will be able to avoid' assenting
to the American proposal. Italy and
Austria, which have assented to the
Anglo-German agreement, will, of course,
follow the lead of the German Era
norcr.
Count de Quadt, German Charge d'Af
faires, has assured Secretary Hay, in ac
cordance with instructions from Berlin,
that the Anglo-German agreement In
volves no menace to any power in China
rind that there is no foundation for re
ports that there were any further or ad
ditional features to the agreement. beyond
those transmitted to the various govern
ments and made public This assurance
bad been expected. The authorities never
theless insist that if they correctly de
scribe the situation, there was then no ne
cessity for the insertion of Article III In
the agreement and It is altogether unlike
ly that the two nations would specifically
"Reserve to themselves the right to enter
into preliminary agreements'" for the pro
tection of their interests, unless they un
derstood In advance - just what they
proposed to do. The United States
will formally accept the principles
set forth in the first two , articles
of agreement and it Is likely that
Secretary Hay will make the move as
indicated relative to an agreement of .all
the- powers respecting the preservation of
the integrity -of China . and the main
tenance of the "open door" and omitting
shy declaration which might be twisted
into a menace against one of the nations
Interested In the settlement of the Chi
nese question.

STARTS WITH A COLD.
Catarrh Is a Lingering Cold Which
Befuses to Yield to Ordi-
nary Treatnieiit.
Catarrh usually starts with a cold, In
the head and if left unchecked In thl3
climate rarely grets well of Itself.
AÂ« fresh cold Is taken the disease
epreads. getting deeper and deeper, 'creep-
Ing along the mucous membranes from
nose to throat, trom throat to windpipe,
from windpipe to oronchlal tubes and
from bronchial tubes to lung cells
The mucous membranes all connect one
with another. Hence it fs easy to spread
from one part to another- lined with thl*
same membrane. This Is why catarrh in
the head soon affectr the throat and fin-
ally the etomach itnelf,- - bringing on
chronic catarrh of the stomach, which la
a most obstinate form of dyspepsia.
Everybody is now well agreed that ca-
tarrh is a .blood disease and not a local
ore, and the attempt to cure by local ar.-
plications simply gives temporary relief
from the purely local symptoms without
the remotest effect in staying the pro-
gress of the disease.
There is a new preparation recently of-
fered to the public that Is apparently
destined to do away with every other form
of catarrh treatment.
This new remedy is not a secret patent
medicine, but is a large, pleat-anf tastinir
tablet composed of Sauguinaria, Eucalyp-
tol. Guaiacol, Hydrastln and other valu-
able and harmless Bpedflcs. which are
taken internally and seem to have a re-
markably beneficial effect upon the blood
and mucous membranes. apparently
eliminating the catarrhal poison from the
whole system.
These tablets, while being pleasant, con-
venient and absolutely safe to use have
made cures In long standing cases of
catarrh that are little short of marvelous
They are sold by druggists under the

appreciate the difference between a mere
palliative and a permanent cure after giv-
ing Stuart's Catarrh Tablets an impartial

All druggists sell them at ED cents for

SEATTLE. Oct. 24. â One man is 'dead,
another badly wounded In the arm and a
third frightfully stabbed about the face
and head as the result of a quarrel In
the fishermen's quarters at West Seattle
early this morning. Eben Lucas shot and
killed John Rogers, who had an hour pre
viously stabbed John Mosoline.
Late last night Rogers, Lucas and Moso
line returned from Seattle, where they
had sold a quantity of fish for $3. Accord-
Ing to witnesses, Rogers was intoxicated,
and demanded that he be given $2. Lucas
refused and angered Rogers. Before go
ing to their bunks the men visited a sa
loon and Rogers picked a quarrel with
Mosoline. The latter attempted to defend
himself and Rogers drew a knife and In
flicted severe wounds. Friends separated
them and Mosoline was taken away.
Some time after this episode Rogers
proceeded to the tent where Lucas lived
and began to quarrel with Lucas* brother
and then with Lucas. Words soon led to
blows and Eben Lucas and Rogers
clinched in the dim light of the lantern
which illuminated the tent. When they
did so Rogers reached for a knife, which
he habitually carried, and seeing this
move Lucas picked 1 up a revolver which
he kept at the side of his bunk and opened
fire.
The men continued clinched while Lucas
fired all of the six shots from the revol
ver, five of which took effect on Rogers
and one of which in the struggle pierced
the arm of the man who fired it. When
the firing ceased Rogers fell back dead.
- Lucas went to the Justice of the Peace
and gave "himself up. All accounts agree
that Rogers was the aggressor and that
Lucas acted In self-defense. The body of
Rogers Is pierced by five .bullets. Three
of the^ entered vital parts.

VALLEJO. Oct. 24.â Mayor Joel A. Har
vey has vetoed as unconstitutional an or
dinance passed by the City Trustees, re
quiring the police to regulate the sale of
liquors by retail, and prohibiting the play-
Ing of certain games in places, where
liquor is sold. The ordinance provided a
penalty for interference with officers in
the discharge of such duties. The Mayor
claims that the ordinance is unconstitu

to the constitution of the United States
and that of the State and the provisions
of the charter.
Another blow aimed at the police force
came In the form'' of letters addressed to
City Auditor Madlgan and Treasurer Col
lins, in which Richard J. Quinlan. a citizen
of Vallejo, gives these officials notice not
to pay the police force Its October salaries
or any money the city may have in. its

Quinlan says he will prosecute them and

Petaluma Merchant Describes His
Voyage on the Horror Ship
Charles D. Lane.
PETALUMA, Oct. 24.â L. L. .Gross, a
merchant of Petaluma, has returned from
a six months' Btay at Cape Nome and
brings a story of his experience on the
seventeen days' sea voyage on the
steamer Charles D. Lane. Gross is ip
remarkably good health, considering the
voyage, but the same cannot be said of
the other 750 passengers who filled the
steamer's Â¦ overcrowded cabins, state
rooms and hold. Bad food, and little of
it, foul water and close quarters drove
many to their beds. The Charles D.
Lanye is now held at Seattle pending tha
outcome of a suit- for redress filed by the
indignant passengers as soon as the boat
reached port. . - â¢Â¦Â»â¢â¢Â¦
The steamer is old and was repainted
and touched =up for 'the Nome service.
-The worn-out machinery was retained
andi the /company reported the- vessel
seaworthy. When four day& out from
Nome the passengers were put upon short
rations and before they, reached Seattle
they were provided with two meals a day
of canned meats and bread only. Then
the two ship's condensers would not work
and the < water served was brackish and
unfit for use. To add to this the engines
and boilers gave out and the steamer
tossed about aimlessly for days. The
passengers i were not allowed to go into
the engine-room, Mr. Gross claims, but at
length : forced their way in to see the
condition of the machinery and an expert
engineer among them was eventually ablo
to repair the boiler tubes and engine
shafts and enabled the steamer to make
port. Had it, not been . for the ; fine
weather experienced throughout the trip,
Mr. Gross says, the vessel could never
have reached Seattle. l '
When the Â» state of - affairs was learned
by the passengers after they started from
Nome, they . organized a committee. . This
committee -repeatedly Â¦Â¦ appealed, to the
captain to run into Dutch Harbor for re
palrs, or v at least for provisions, but the
captain would'not comply for fear, as Mr.,
Gross - asserts, that the revenue "cutter

LODT. Oct. 24. â "Work has been com
menced on the new dam at Wood
bridge, two miles from here, by
the Mokelumne Canal and Irri
gation Company. The structure
will cost about $35,000. This project is of
vital importance to the people of North
ern San Joaquin, and its completion will
be a godsend to many dairymen, alfalfa
growers and orchardlsts.
At present scrapers arÂ« throwing up a
huge levee across the bottom land to the
west bank of the river, where the big
stone dam will be put in immediately.
Trees and brush are being cut out of the
bottoms to make ready for the levee gar.g
in its advancement. Within a few days
a force of 150 or more men will be at work,
rushing the structure to completion..
The new dam will be built of rock and
brush, and the best authorities claim that
it will hold forever. At the point of oper
ations the river Is narrow, having a clay
bluff on the east side, but on the west a
great levee must be constructed. It is
the best site for a dam that can be found
within a radius of miles. At this place
the riverbed is composed of hard blue
clay, well caiculated to remain firm. The
light rock will be brought down from Fol
som, while the heavy masses. will be quar-
rlec 5 . near Valley Spr.'ng, being brought
dlrtct to the site over the narrow gauge
line running to Valley Spring. Thousands
of cords of brush will be required, as al
ternate layers of rock and brush will be
dumped into place as the dam is con
structed. The new dam will give the
water a fall of six feet at the mouth of
the canal, which is enough to carry it
briskly to the end of the system, not far
from Stockton. It is the intention to rush
the work through this year, and the pro
moters claim It can be finished within,
6lx weeks.
The story of the old canal company Is
interesting. Byron D. Beckwith attempt
ed to Interest the farmers in the beauties
of a joint stock company, which would
put in a^dam. construct the canal and so
own Its own waterway. The plan failed
and the Woodbridge Canal and Irrigation
Company was formed. Finally the At
lantic Trust Company was interested In
the scheme and purchased enough stock
to warrant the construction of the dam at
a cost of nearly $15,000. That was ten
years' ago. , Stock, bonds and script were
Issued to meet the second year's expense
incurred in dipping the canal. An .assess
ment was levied on the capital stock. In
the third year the canal and its laterals
were completed. Then the company de
cided to put in a rock and cement dam at
Campo Seco, twenty miles up the Mokel
umne. and bring the water down to this
vicinity in a new canal, thus covering a
vast territory with a great irrigation sys-

Gist ol Secret Testimony
Heard by the Insanity
Commission..
YOUNG LADY SPENT MUCH MONEY
Investigators Will Decide That She
Leave the Private Asylum at
Stockton, but Be K=pt Un
der Restraint.
STOCKTON, Oct. 24.â So general Is the
opinion' among the friends of Mary Fraser
that the. State Lunacy Commission will
, refuse to release her. from a local private
asylum that they are already outlining
'their next move to win the girl's freedom.
They will stop at nothing short of the
Supreme Court and an appeal to the Gov
ernor himself. Steps will be taken Im
mediately to have the matter of Miss
Fraser's mental condition tried before a
jury In open court. Upon the filing of the
decision of the Insanity Commission.
Bhould it prove to be against the young
woman, the Supreme Court will be peti
tioned to have the case set for trial, a
Jury to be drawn In the usual way. It
will be a public trial.
pare a Plan of Action.
Stockton Friends of Miss Fraser Pre-
Outside of the physicians, the witnesses
examined by the commission were all on
the part of Miss Fraser. No attempt was
made to secure the testimony of witnesses
other than physicians on behalf of the
girl's father, who stands charged with
Illegally restraining her from her liberty.
To sum up,- the commission got the im
pression . from the testimony and from
conversations held with different people
in Stockton that the girl should be kept
for a while at least under some restraint,
and the belief here is that the commission
will so find. The commission, it is pointed
out, might order MiS3 Fraser*s discharge
from the licensed private asylum, where
she is now confined, but that act would
not restore her to competency since she
would still be under the care of her father
as- guardian. -
WILL APPEAL TO THE COURT.
There was not presented to the commis
sion the slightest evidence of immorality
on the part of the young woman, nor was
there anything disclosed showing that she
was addicted to liquor. 'There had been
talk of her use of drugs, but the commis
sion was not able to learn that drugs had
brought about her present condition. Mlas
Fraser herself admitted that she had for
merly used morphine, but declared that
she had not done so for some years, and
there was nothing to indicate that this
statement was otherwise than true.
From the evidence gained by the Lunacy
Commission in its secret session at Stock
ton it developed that Miss Fraser had
fallen into habits of extravagance only
possible from one of unbalanced mind;
that she had In one year contracted bills
for underwear alone aggregating $1500;
that she had given evidences of a violent
temper; that she had persistently dis
obeyed her father, and had been very vio
lent toward him when he asked her as to
where she had been on occasions when
she left home.
SACRAMENTO. Oct. 24.â It Is expected
that the State Lunacy Commission will
prepare its findings on Saturday next in
the matter of the investigation into the
sanity of Miss Mary Fraser of Stockton.
There Is little doubt that the commission
will decide that Alias Fraser is a proper
person to keep under some form of re
straint. It Is said Miss Fraser will not
particularly object to this, but thaf she
decidedly opposes the Idea of being quar
tered In any asylum for the Insane, even
though It Is a private asylum. She is
said to be not averse to being placed in a
sanitarium, and it is believed to be proba
ble that she will be allowed to leave the
private asylum in which she is now re
strained and be installed in a sanitarium.

the decision of the Stanford athletic com-,
mittee M. de Witt, the crack . freshman
halfback, ( will not be allowed to represent
the cardinal on the gridiron In next Sat
urday's Intercollegiate contest. The

the fact that De Witt took part in a hose
race In Visalia on the Fourth of July,

Manager Gildersleeve, when informed of
the decision, was much surprised at the
action of the committee. Inasmuch as the
protest Is not binding- under the intercol
legiate agreement. He claims that within
a week he couW produce counter affi
davits that would leave no. doubt of De
Witt's amateur standing. The general
impression among the students here 13
that the committee rendered an adverse
decision out of courtesy to the Berkeley
management, which last week barred
Overall from the California team.

Russell, Wilson & Allen's Wedding Bells
was an easy winner of the midweek stake
at Union Park yesterday and earned all
the credit and honors that go with a suc
cession of . victories. For a time in the
deciding- course T. M. Clarkson's Golden
Garter made the backers of Wedding
Bolls a bit uneasy in the pockets, but the
hare was strong and gave the "Bells"
a chance to ring out peals of victory.
Golden Garter took the lead and the
first two turns. After that Wedding Bella
showed her ability to work hard and
pile up a blsr score. In the first round
the stake-winner put out Cash, a 6-1 fa
vorite. This was the only big dump the
talent received. There were a few other
short enders that cashed, but the day on
the whole belonged to the favorites. The

Sloan. "Walter Violet was second and Sir
J. Miller's Tannstycker, with Maher up,
ran third.
The event of the day was the Cam
bridgeshire stakes, which J. H. Sullivan's
Berrill won. Twenty-four horses ran. In
this race Tod Sloan rode M. Ephrussi's
Codman, which finished second, and Good
Luck, on which , Lester Reiff had the
mount.' was .'third. Berrill made most of
the running and won In- hollow fashion
by three lengths. Four lenrths sepa
rated second and third horses.
The betting: was 20 to 1 against Berrill,
100 to 1 against Codman. 8 to 1 against
Good Luck and 3 to 1 against The Reeve,
Â¦which was the favorite, ridden by Maher,
and which finished fifth. The time. 1:54,
constitutes a record for j the course, ono
mile and 240 yards;
An all-aged selling plate of 103 sover
eigns for three-year-olds and upward was
won by Mr. McCreery's Bell Hampton,
ridden by Maher. Red Hand, with Sloan
up, was second.

There is no room for argument as to
the weakening effect of these diseases.
There is also no room for argument as
to the power of Dr. Pierce's Favorite
Prescription to enre them. It regulates
the periods, stops unhealthy drains, heals"
inflammation and ulceration, and cures
female weakness. It is a purely veget-
able preparation, and canno* disagree
with the weakest constitution. There is
no alcohol in "Favorite Prescription,"
and it is entirely free , from opium,
cocaine and all narcotics.
Sick women suffering from chronic

ciaHst in the diseases of women. All

HENRY AT MOWBY HALL.
Democratic Candidate for Congress
Talks on Issues of Campaign.
J. H. Henry, candidate ! for Congress
from the' Fifth District, was the principal
speaker at a Democratic rally at Mowry
Hall, Grove and Laguna streets, last
night. The attendance was fairly good.
William M. Cannon called the meeting to
order and > introduced Mr. Henry, who
spoke in part as follows:
If I have a paramount fault it is that of ex
pressing my opinions on every occasion. I
deem my position on tne Issues of the campaign
is in harmony with that of my party.
Imperialism goes to the very foundation of
the government. The Republicans deny that
there has been any effort to place this gov
ernment on an imperialistic basis. They deny
that the Filipinos are capable of self-govern
ment. The Democrats assert that they are. I
believe the Republicans are conducting that
war under the influence of the trusts headed
by Mark Hanna to' secure the resources of the
islands for their, own purposes.
Now, these questions will come up before the
next Congress, of which I expect to be a mem
ber. Remembering that it is never too late to
right a wrong, I say that if we find it was a
mistake to raise the flag in the Philippines it
Is no dishonor to haul it down.
* The Republicans tell us we are for free trade-.
I maintain that- the Democratic party is for
tariff for revenue, and when laid for protection
to rewound to the benefit of the many and not
for the few.
In my opinion the grreat mass of the people
believe in bimetallism. I want to know if any
man claims that bimetallism can be secured
without maintaining the parity of the metals
The Democrats believe that can be done with
out the aid of any foreign government. No
Democratic Congressman will be asked to vote
for any Â¦ monetary measure that does not pro
vide for maintaining the parity of the metals.
We favor the establishment of a department
of labor, with a secretary In the Cabinet.
The Democrats are in favor of the extension
of the Chinese exclusion act or the enactment
of another with some changes.
We are in 'favor of a graduated income tax.
With all due respect to the Supreme Court, If
it is necessary I favor a constitutional amend
ment that will make such a tax valid.
I believe -that, in the interests of humanity
a leprosy hospital should be established by the
government to take care of the lepers In the
United States. (Voice. "How about eight hours
for labor?") There Is an eight-hour law now.
Isn't there? I am in favor of enforcing the
law. . "
Alexander McCulloch, candidate for AÂ«
semblyman from' the Thirty-seventh Dis
trict, spoke briefly, and William E. White,
candidate for State Senator from the
Twenty-first District, was introduced.
He appealed to his auditors to thrust par
ty lines aside and vote for principle, irre
spective - of prejudice. He advocated
strongly a primary election law;> He said:
"If I ro to, Sacramento I shall do my
best with the aid of others to enact a fair
and square primary law." . . â¢ . â¢ ,
8: ~E. Vermilyea also spoke. .
ELECTION BOOTHS TOO
CLOSE TO CAB TRACES
George Bronson, an Insurance Clerk,
Bumps Into One With Disas
trous Iwesults.
George Bronson, an employe of Gutte
& Frank, insurance agents, and residing
at 2940 Howard street, was badly cut
about the head while riding home on a
Mission street car last night. The car
was crowded and Bronson was clinging
to one of the stanchions. As the car was
passing an election booth set close to tha
track between Sixth and Seventh streets
Bronson was struck by the structure. Ho
retained his hold, but his head was driven
through the window in the front of the
car. His cheek and scalp were deeply cut.
One of the passengers grabbed Bronson
and prevented his falling off under the
wheels of the car.
He was removed to a doctor's office
near by. where his injuries were dressed,
and was afterward removed to his home.
The Irish School.
The Irish school at Hibernia Hall at
tracted a large number of visitors as well
as students at its last regular session on
Tuesday evening. An interesting pro
gramme of exercises was provided for the
entertainment of those present, among
the principal numbers being a Gaelic song,
"Fainne Gal an Lae," by Jeremiah Deasy.
The Dear Little Shamrock" was sung by
Master Joseph Kelly. J. F. Lally gave a
comic recitation, and a vocal solo in

nie MacNeil, the famous war song of the
Highlands. "The McGregor's Gathering "
Mi?s Mary A. Henehan, a rural member,
donated a quantity of Gaelic literature
and a sum ' of money.
W. J. Newman and his wife and daugh
ter of Mount Athos, Somerset. Va_. are
stopping at the Palace. They arrived in
the city last Saturday, and notwithstand
ing the dispatch sent out from Los Ange
les to the effect that the Southern Pacific
Company is hunting for Newman.. alleging
that he passed a worthless check, the Vir
ginian is making no attempt to conceal his
Identity. The dispatch says that Newman
burst into Los Angeles like a meteor two
weeks ago, and after making everybody
believe he was a millionaire departed as
suddenly as he had appeared, leaving a
check for $500 which has been protested.
Mr. Newman was willing to talk when
seen in his sumptuous apartments at the
Palace last evening. He had heard about
the story from Los Angeles and was much
surprised.
"I will deposit $5000 in cold cash in the
office of this hotel," said he. vehemently,
"and if you or any one else can find a
floating check for $500 or any other sum
that has gone to protest I will forfeit the
deposit.
"la the first place." continued Newman,
who is a stocky built man with an affable
way about him, "the check was for $5.">0
and not $500. It was drawn on the Ameri*
can National Bank of Orange, Va., in
which bank my wife owns a controlling
number of shares. We had intended to go
to Panama on a pleasure trip and I
bought my tickets in Los Angeles of an
agent named Kirr. whom I knew and
whom I dtsired to give the benefit of the
sale. Because of the unpleasant notoriety
we have b<^fÂ»n given we shall return to
New York Friday."
Mr. N'-wman unhesitatingly admits that
he is worth several millions of dollars.
He wears a prodigious opal stud set with
more than a hundred beautiful diamonds,
and carries a $1000 Tiffany watch. His
wife also possesses much beautiful and
costly jewelry and says she has ten $1000
bank notes locked in h*r trunk.
In the Divorce Court.
Decrees of divorce were granted yester- '
day to Florence Morris from Henry \V.
Morris for infidelity, Etta Newbauer from
Saul Newbauer for failure to provide and
Mary A. Maher from William E. Maher
for infidelity and extreme cruelty.

ure to provide were filed yesterday by
Eva Holcomb against George \V. Hol
comb, Catherine E. Matthews against
William J. Matthews, Mary A. Stade
against John Stade, Belle Peckham
against Joseph Peckham and Sarah A.
Potter against Matthew Potter. Joseph
T. Cardoza has sued Jennie Merrill Grant
Cardoza for divorce, alleging infidelity as
cause of action. Gertrude White (nee
Amsel) has sued her husband. Thomas H.
White, to annul their marriage. Plaintiff
alleges that at the time of their marriage
her husband was legally incapacitated un
der the laws of Oregon, where they were
married, from taking a wife. Emma The
resa Willis has sued William Francis Wll
11b for a divorce, alleging cruelty aa cause
of action.
PLUNGER NEWMAN SAYS
HIS CHECKS ARE GOOD
Virginian, Whom Southern Pacific Was
Said to Be Seeking, Is at the Palace.
The preliminary examination of General
C. H. M. y Agramonte on the charge of
felony embezzlement, preferred against
him by John M. Chretien, the disgraced
attorney, was held before Judge Cabanlas
yesterday afternoon and the case was dis
missed. Attorney McCuskey specially
prosecuted the case and the defendant
was represented by ex-Judge Pierce, Reu
ben H. Lloyd and Charles L. Patton.
The witnesses examined were M. R.
Higgins, vice president; Charles N. Fox.
attorney, and S. W. Marks, secretary o"
the Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Com
pany. They all testified In effect that at
the time the defendant's agency In Mex
ico of the company ceased, in March, 1S34,
there was a dispute as to Â«.. p accounts
between the defendant and the company,
Agramonte claiming that the company
was indebted to him to the extent of
about $14,000 and the company claiming
that he defendant was short to the ex
tent of $1450. Suit was commenced by
| the defendant in the City of Mexico
against the company and he garnlsheed
about $1500 of the company's lunds that
was in Carlos Scherrer's bank. The com
pany Instituted suit against the defendant
for the recovery of the $1450, and his
sureties, of whom Chretien's wife was
one, were made a party to the suit. A
compromise of this suit was effected by
the payment of $750 by the sureties. But
the defendant was not aware of the suit
having been instituted or compromised.
It was later admitted that the defendant
was a creditor of the company and he
was awarded the money in the bank In
Mexico, which he had garnisheed. but by
that time the bank had failed and he did
not get a cent.
No technical objections to any state
ments of the witnesses were made by the
defendant's attorneys. The Judge in dis
missing the case said there was no evi-
I dence to support he charge.

REPUBLICANS TO
HAVE HELP FROM
THE YOUNG MEN
The Board of Education refused yester
day to accept the judgment of State Su
perintendent of Schools Kirk that Eben
ezer Knowlton, the suspended vice prin
cipal; is entitled to his salary and rein
statement. Superintendent .Webster of
ficially informed the Directors at their
meeting of Kirk's decision, which was
received in silence. Webster then' intro
duced a resolution providing for the pay
ment of Knowlton's salary for : September.
Ixrnman seconded the motion for adop
tion, to bring it before the board, he said,
and 'the four Directors thereupon voted
against the resolution. Webster expressed
his Intention to draw up Knowlton's de
mand, and should the Auditor/refuse to
audit it Knowlton will have recourse to
mandamus, proceedings *to determine tho
authority of the State Superintendent *n
ordering his reinstatement.
Webster gave notice that he would not
pign the demands of the employes of che
rtpaii department, as his attorney had
advised him that as the power of repair
ing schoolhouses had been transferred to
the Board of Public Works the demands
could not be paid out of the common
school fund.
A resolution introduced by Superintend
ent Webster reappointing \V. T. Plunkett
vice principal of the Lincoln Evening
School received no second, and another
establishing an additional class in the
Lafayette Primary School was taken un
der advisement.
The board gave notice for amendment
to its rule governing the call for substi
tutes by principals. Section 53 now pro
vides that if a teacher is absent not less
than five days the" principal must teach
the class. The rule as contemplated will
read as follows:
In the case of absence of teachers for a
period of not less than one day in primary or
grammar schools of eight or more classes the
principals must teach* the classes and shall not
call for substitutes, unless there are two teach
ers absent in the same school at the same time.
The effect of the change will be that
substitutes will obtain more frequent em
plovment than heretofore, the principals
will bo relieved of teaching classes in ad
dition to their other duties.
Section 26 is to be amended to provide
for a vacation of one week during Octo
ber. Section 49 will authorize principals
to assign teachers annually instead of
seml-annually to classrooms, so that thev
shall alternate In the occupancy of de
sirable and undesirable rooms.

C&US6 Of
Business Failures, \
' Â¦ 1
Life's path is beset with terrors. The nerves must be
like iron to resist its many shocks. -
An eminent physician estimates that many of the failures
of business men are directly traceable to a debilitated
I physique. They overwork brain and body and when danger
\ comes^ â meeting no firm opponent â it hurls them into the deep j
\ abyss of utter failure. . i
; This is a scientific fact. Don't blame j-our luck or fate or
i fortune. Realize that the fault lies -within yourself, and then |
and think the matter out Weak nerves spring from impure
blood. Impure blood comes from a weak stomach. Weak-
ness in the stomach means catarrh of the lining of the stomach,
just as weakness in the kidneys or liver or lungs means catarrh
of the lining of these organs. Cure the catarrh, and health [
comes back. i
The medicine to do this is Pe-ru-na. Your brain will j
brighten, your weakness will disappear â the horizon of life
"will appear brilliantly hopeful â you'll find yourself made of the
stuif which produces successful men. It is strictly a food for
the entire body. It makes manly men and beautiful women.
It builds up the weak places and fortifies the syEteir - ~iinst \
\ disease. C *~

WHAT IS OVARITIS?
A dull, throbbing pain, accompanied
by a sense of tenderness and heat low
down in the side, with an occasional
shooting pain, indicates inflammation.
On examination it will be found that
the region of pain shows some swell-
ing. This ia the first stage of ovaritis,
inflammation of the ovary. If the roof
of your house leaks, my sister, you have
it fixed at once ; why not pay the same
respect to your own body ?

House of Representatives.* The fight for that branch
of the Government remains . close, and the result' is
still doubtful.^ It is therefore highly important that
Republicans in every Congressional district should be
The reason of the decline is attributed by political
experts to Bryan himself. As one of them puts it:
"Bryan has talked himself out.'/ He has shown in his
later speeches none of that seeming sincerity and cour
age for which people used to give him credit. On the
contrary, he has been evasive, tricky and false. Before
the Democratic convention met he began his canvass
by declaring that- the fight should again be made for
the free coinage of silver. At the dictation of Tam
rcany Hall he shifted his ground so far as to make
"irnpertalssm" the chief issue. A little later, finding
that issue unfavorably received in the 6011th and by
his Southern supporters, he began talking against
trusts. From that point he was warned by Croker,
and since then he has contented himself with vague
declamations against the army, against prosperity and
against the Supreme Court. ,
The effect of these various changes has been disas
trous to his following. His campaign has fallen flat.
It is nothing like the tremendous sweep he made in
1896. He has not furnished his party with a single
campaign cry, a single argument or even a telling
phrase to be quoted, in the press or shouted from the
stump. He has gone on from blunder to blunder,
until now he has sunk to the level of the lowest dema
gog}'. He has lately been telling workingmen that
there is a growing tendency to use the army to settle
strikes, to shoot workingmen, and similar wild things â¢
which are as false as they. are wild.
REPORTS from Washington, where political ex
perts study the whole country from a standpoint
unvexed by the noise of a local campaign, are
to the effect that during the last two or three weeks
there has been a notable weakening in the force of
the Bryan movement. Had a vote been taken a
month ago Bryan would have received a larger vote
than he would to-day, and he would have more votes
tc-day than he will receive in November. His
strength is diminishing in every section of the Union,
and were the campaign to last two months longer he
would hardly carry .". single' State outside the solid

CALITORNIAl-JS IN NEW YORK.
PERSONAL MENTION.
The systematic and careful training which Mr.
Sloss has had at Harvard and in the seven years of
his practice will enable him to give decisions that will
stand the test of the higher court and thus save time
and expense to litigants. That he will be impartial
and faithful to the best traditions of the bench is not
to be doubted. His election will therefore be a pub
lic benefit, and -he. merits the support of all good citi
zens, irrespective of party.
The people of San Francisco who have had any
business with the courts are well aware of the value
to the community of having upon the bench a Judge
who is well grounded in the general principles of law.
A large part of our litigation is due to the errors of
Judges, whose decisions the Supreme Court has to
overrule. The new trials ordered in these cases block
the courts and stop the progress of other cases and
thus cause a good-deal of that delay in getting final
decisions which is so vexatious to the public and so
harmful to business.
Having begun his education in our public schools,
Mr. Sloss^was prepared for the university at Belmont.
He graduated from Harvard in 1890 and immediately
entered the Harvard Law School, taking his degree
in 1893. Returning to this city for the practice of his.
profession, he became a member of the firm of Chick
cring, Thomas & Gregory, and has been with the firm
for seven years. During his studies and in his prac
tice he has given special attention to commercial law
and probate law, two branches of the profession of
great importance in this city, where such large com
mercial intere'sts are at stake and such great estates
are to be administered.
Mr. Sloss, while still a young man, is well known
in legal and commercial circles. He is a member of
one of the most honored families in the city, being
a son of Louis Sloss of the Alaska Commercial Com
pany. His training for the bar has been thorough,
and in his practice he has been engaged in some of the
most important cases before the courts of recent years.
mr. m. c. sloss:
WHEN the voters of the city go over the list of
candidates for Superior Judge they will find
none more worthy of support than M. C.
Sloss. Under our system of elections candidates for
all offices are nominated on party tickets, and so Mr.
Sloss stands as a Republican nominee, but no. man
will more truly represent upon the bench the desire
of the whole people for an impartial, non-partisan and
upright judiciary.
Evidently under this administration the Republicans
nre fish and the Phelanites fowl, since the former are
held to a strict accountability for their conduct and:
the latter are rnonarchs of all they survey.
But in strong contrast to this method of interpret
ing the charter is the attitude of Phelan toward the
Republican officials who have dared to question its
provisions. Not long ago County Clerk Deane pro
tested against the dismi^al cf a number of his com
petent copyist* to -make places for PheUnites passed
by the Civil Service Board. Immediate^' he was
threatened with suspension by the Mayor.
In fact, he himself has recommended the Super
visors to violate it iÂ»i appointing two clerks in the
registration bureau at higher salaries than is allowed
by the organic law. All this has been done by Phelan
and the Phelanites without protest from anybody.
Maj-or Phelan began '1iis administration by de
r.ouncing as a "traitor" every official who dared to
question the provision-; of the new charter. He inti
mated that a tlark and dismal conspiracy existed on
the part of outsiders to destroy the instrument by
adverse interpretation, and he declared that all his
powers should be exerted to enrry it out in its homely
integrity. Vet he has permitted the Assessor and
Treasurer, in pursuit of perquisites abolished by the
charier, to bring suits by which some of its impor
tant provisions will be annulled; the District Attor
ney to violate it in appointing a disqualified assist
ant; the Board of Public Works to violate it in per
forming public work without letting a contract, and
the Board of Health to violate it in creating a plague
scare.
The resolution was received with decided disfavor
by all the Phelanites in the board, and upon motion
of "Buggy Robe" Sam Braunhart â one of the alleged
beneficiaries of the Treasurer's favor â it was referred
to the Finance Committee, whence it will probably
never emerge.
Instances of these two species cf phenomena mul
tiply incessantly. At the meeling of. the Supervisors
en Monday Mr. McCarthy introduced a resolutici
calling on the Finance Committee to investigate the
cfike of Treasurer Brooks on charges of havinj
drawn warrants out oi their registered order. The
Supervisor alleged that certain Phelanites in and out
oi the board had bceu awarded their salaries for June
bst in violation of the charter rule, which requires
that demands fhali be paid only in the order of their
registration.
THE FISH flND THE FOWL.
OBSERVING readers of The Call's news col
umns during the past ten months can scarcely
have failed to note that whenever the provi
sions of the new chartei conflict with the personal in
terests of the Phelanites at the City Hall they receive
a very free and easy interpretation. At the same time
the same readers can scarcely have failed also to note
that whenever the same or similar provisions conflict
with the interests of anybody who does not belong
to the Phelan faction they receive an exceedingly
tlrict and circumspect interpretation.

I support President McKinley because I
love my country; because I am an Ameri
can; because every fiber In my body re
bels against the policy of furnishing either
aid or encouragement to the men who
are now firing on our flag and shooting at
our soldiers. It was public sentiment that
caused President McKinley to declare war
against Spain, even before the nation was
ready for the flght. How grandly and no
bly the boys from all over the land re

proud kingdom of Spain need not here be
told, but this Philippine rebellion is but
the outcome of the Spanish war which

Â¦ war, I am going to stand by President
McKinley until he finishes the job.
Can a person distinguish between the
promises of Bryan and McKinley made In
1896? Bryan said times would be harder
In four years if McKinley was elected,
while McKinley said he would make
"times better, much better." Which has
prophesied correctly?
Much of the prosperity Is now invisible
because hundreds of millions of dollars
have been used to pay oft mortgages cre
ated under the blight of Clevelandism.

improvements, and if McKinley is re
elected times will improve as much over

vote for Mr. Wilkins because they know

One phase of Mr. "Wllklns* fight that

being done for Mr. Wilkins by "Warden

Governor Gage will be called to this lack

It would be a great deal better if John
J. Valentine were to pay the express war
tax instead of spending his money on the
pamphlet entitled "Americanism.
The ratio of 16 to 1 means that the
United States will coin an ounce of silver
worth 60 cents into $1 29 and redeem it in
gold on derjjand. Where will the United
States get seven billion dollars in gold to
redeem the silver that the world will
dump into the United States mint under
free coinage at the ratio of 16 to 1? A 12
year-old school child can readily see that
the world's silver will come to the United
States If Uncle Sam offers $1 29 for every
60 cents' worth of silver in existence, ev
ery .piece of plate and silverware as well
as foreign coin would be melted and sold
to the united States.
Therefore, I cannÂ»t support Bryan on
the silver question, as I maintain that the
free coinage of silver by the United States
without an international agreement will
bankrupt the United States and all her
people.
As the silver question was the only rea
son why I supported Bryan, It will readily
be seen that no sensible man who has
Practically every nation on earth has
repudiated silver as standard money, ex
cepting Old Mexico. .The last named
country is the only one on earth that has
free coinage of silver. When Bryan ran
for President in 1896 the following nations
were on a silver; or bimetallic basis:
Countryâ Population.
Mexico 13.000,000
Russia 130,000,000
Japan 45,000,000
South America ; 38,000,000
Central America 3,800.000
China-:.* 383.500,000
India *.:.-. 25)8,000.000
Slam:.......:,........ â 5,000,000
Straits Settlements 3.&00.000
France .....A 38,500,000
â¢ Add to this the United States and Bryan
would have had at his back in case of his
election in 1896 over a billion people of
this earth, or over two-thirds of the
earth's population,- in favor of the free
coinage of silver. But within four months
after Bryan's defeat and before McKin
ley was sworn into office, Russia, Japan,
several South and Central American
states and India repudiated the silver
standard, over one-half billion people
switching to the gold standard at almost
a moment's notice. Since then China with
her 383,500,000 people has been cut up into
spheres of inlluence and placed for all In
tents and purposes on the gold standard.
So we find of all the silver standard coun
tries in 1896 only Old Mexico that still
maintains the free coinage of silver. Cen
tral and South America, Siam and the
Straits Settlements havo not changed
their money standard from silver to gold,
but even in these nations the exchange
and trade Is valued and measured In Eng
lish, American, French or German gold.
The only nation on earth that measures
its values in silver Is Mexico So instead
of a billion people backing the free coin
age of silver, as they did in 1896, there
.are less than 75,000,000 people even after
we count Central and South America,
Mexico. Slam and the Straits Settlements.
Therefore, I contend that any man who
thought the United States was powerful
enough â¢ to maintain the price of silver
alone in 1S96 must concede now that the
United States cannot maintain the price
of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1, independ
ent of all other nations and in direct op
position to over four-fifths of the world.

WILLIAM GLASMANN. editor and
proprietor of the Ogden Standard,
one of |the leading â¢ newspapers of
â¢ Utah, has abandoned the cause of
William J. Bryan, and announced
his intention to support President McKln
ley for re-election. He considers the
silver question the "paramount" Issue be
fore the people. this year, despite the at
tempts of Democracy's standard-bearer to
keep it in the background, and as he be
lieves that the free coinage of the white
metal would bankrupt the nation, he has
turned from the Bryanite forces and
joined the party of prosperity. An inter
esting statement by Mr. Glasmanri fol
lows:
"Editor San Francisco Call: In 1896 I
stumped the State of Nebraska for Bryan
and silver, making seventy-two speeches,
but I cannot say a word for the Nebraska
statesman this year.
No class of public servants renders a more impor
tant service to the community than the teachers in
our public schools. Most of them are v women having
no votes and consequently they cannot exert political
fcrce to obtain what is due them. It is therefore the
more imperative that the general body of citizens
should take care of the rights of the teachers, and
in this instance no good citizen should neglect hts
duty in that respect. Bear the amendment in mind
and vote for it.
4. It has been legally determined that the only means
of paying this debt to the teachers is by the adoption of
this amendment by the State at large.
1. The failure to pay these salaries was a great in
justice to the* teachers and a serious reflection on the
good name of the city. ;
2. San Francisco meets the. entire indebtedness: the
State at large pays none of it. , . -
3. The amendment permits, but does not compel, the
San Francisco Supervisors to pay these claims.
To tho Voters of California: Vote Tee on Senate con
stitutional amendment No. 15, which la the seventh on
the ticket. This provides that the city and county of
San Francisco may at any time pay the salaries of Its
teachers, due * for services rendered In November and
December, 1898, because:
For the purpose of bringing the issue to public at
tention the teachers have prepared a statement, which
was published in The Call yesterday. It is short, and
we republish it in order that any one who may have
overlooked it may have another opportunity to read
it. It runs thus: â¢* Â¦
BY all law, human or divine, the workman is
worthy. of his hire. A community that does not
pay those who have been faithful in its service'
is a dishonest community: San Francisco is indebted
to her teachers. It appears that under the law there is
no way by whichlthafdebt can be paid except by the
adoption of aconstitutional amendment. Accordingly
an amendment, has "been submitted to the voters
'authorizing the' city, to make the payment. That
amendment should be adopted. It should receive the
vote of every man who goes to the polls.

alert and active in supporting their candidate. The
victory this year should be overwhelming.' The
surest way to eliminate Bryanism from our politics is
to defeat not only him but every, candidate who stands
for his principles, policies and practices. :
That is the Republican pledge upon this important
ifpue. Democracy has nothing to offer. As it has
I been always opposed to protection to American farms
and factories, so it will continue to oppose American
ship-building and ship-owning. If we are to have an
â¢American marine worthy of the name, the people
I must continue the Government in the hands of the
] party oF progress and prosperity.
The Republican party stands for that governmental
policy which logically sanctions liberal legislation in
the direction of supporting American shipping. The
Philadelphia platform declares: "Our present de
pendence upon foreign shipping for nine-tenths of our
foreign carrying is a great loss to the industry of this
country. It is also a serious danger to our trade, for
its sudden withdrawal in the event of European war
would seriously cripple our expanding, foreign com
merce. The national defense and naval efficiency of
this country, moreover, supply A compelling reason
for legislation which will enable us to recover our
former place among the trade carrying fleets of the
world."
The need of upbuilding an American merchant
marine has long been felt, not only by the merchants
of the country, but by producers of all classes of goods
that are exported in large quantities. Reports of our
imports and exports show enormous balances of trade
irt our favor, and jet it is known those balances are
heavily reduced by the tribute we pay to foreign ship
owners who carry our ocean commerce for us. We
pay the foreigner for transporting our exports and
we pay him for bringing in our imports. It is a literal
case of catching us "coming and going." The pay
ment of this tribute amounts to nearly $1,000,000 a
day, and that includes the direct loss only, taking no
account of the trade we lose by reason of lacking a
merchant marine of our own to pfomote it.
In discussing our trade with South America gener
ally Mr. Dudley notes that the most serious handi
cap under which we labor is the lack of shipping.
That lack, indeed, has been noted in every quarter of
the globe, on every ocean and in every important port.
Mr. Dudley is reported as saying: "What is needed
tc develop the trade of this coast with Peru is better
transportation facilities.' Now the principal articles
which are imported from this part of the United States
are lumber and wheat. These come principally from
California, though Oregon gets a share of the trade.
It is expected that there will be a development of con
siderable passenger travel through San Diego by rea
son of the rate of $200 from Callao to New York
made by the Cosmos line of German steamers. It is
by reason of their direct lines of transportation that
the English and Germans now control the trade of
Peru. With more perfect facilities there should be
shipped many products which now are imported from
Europe. One thing which should form a consider
able item of California's trade is wines. The Peru
vians use a great deal of claret, with their meals prin
cipally, and this should come from here."
A NEED FOR MORE SHIPS.
SINCE the Spanish war there has been much talk
of a growing antagonism on the part of the
people of the various countries in South
America against, the United States, and fears have
been expressed lest it might lead to injury to our
commercial relations. In fact, a conference lias been
called at Madrid of all the Latin races and some inti
mations have been given that one of the objects of
the conference is that of promoting trade between the
Latin countries of Europe and those of South
America, to the exclusion, as far as possible, of trade
between ourselves and the South' Americans.
The wide circulation of such reports and the seem- |
ing reliability of them renders it gratifying to have a
"statement from Irving B. Dudley, United States Min
ister to Peru, to the 'effect that our trade with that
country has been increased rather than diminished
by the war and is now in a flourishing condition. In
an interview Mr. Dudley is quoted as saying: "The
increased prestige oÂ£ the United States since the war
has wrought such a change in the minds of the citi
zens of the country to which I am accredited that
more than ever there is a desire for things American.
Our trade with Peru has doubled in the past two
years. This is due largely to the fact that the sugar
of that country, which theretofore had been shipped
direct to Liverpool, has been diverted to the New
York market."

Another thing that Shakespeare seems
to believe in Is goodness; not the rood
ness that has Its reward, but virtue that
Is its own reward. King Lear, has often
been compared to a tempest; in the midst
of the storm and chaos a ray of moon
light breaks through the clouds and
throws Its silvery radiance Â»*ofl^rthe
queenly figure of Cordelia standing, calm
'and peaceful like an angel of, truth and
purity amid the raging strife of a sinful
and blood-stained world." After all that
may be said about evil, the fact remains
that Cordelia and Kent are, and'somehow
the clouds roll away. As Edward Dow
den says. "Shakespeare does not supp.V
us with a doctrine, with an Interpretation,
with a revelation. He has no better gift
to bestow than the strength and courago
to pursue our own path, through pain or
through Joy. with vigor and resolution."
Does Shakespeare suggest ac--j- soratlon
of the problem of evil and any alleviation
of pain? The answer to this may beat
be seen by comparing him with Brown
ing, the most Shakespearean of all mod
ern poets. He, too. felt the reality of
evil in the world: the creater. of Guldo
and Otlma. and a score of other char
acters was no shallow optimist: bo saw
life steadily and saw it whole. And
yet Browning's death scenes are his ao*t
triumphant ones; the light of another
world breaks upon the sufferings ani-J
failures of this world. Pompil'la and
Paracelsus Constance and Norbert, Mil
dred and Slertoun all die with words of
faith and hope on their lips. ' There Is.
as It were, a fifth act where all evil Is
overcome and the withheld completions
of life are realized. Two things Brown-
Ing seems to offer as a solution to such
tragedies as he and Shakespeare have
representedâ the God of love and the Im
mortality of the soul. Shakespeare's
characters find -no such comfort in thÂ»
hour of death, nor Is the reader given thiÂ»
least basis for such an interpretation. It
is tragedy In Its sternest aspectâ the
tragedy of earthly love and passion. He
is as unconcerned about the solution of
any problems of life a^ life Itself; the sun
of his genius shines on the just and the
unjust, and no clew is given to the my
tery of life. Â¦> . %
There are two things that may be legiti
mately Inferred from the tragedies of
Shakespeare. One of them has been well
expressed by James Lane Allen In his
"Reign of Law": "Tragical suffering is
the privilege of great natures." Admira
tion In any form always implies the en
durance of suffering. The great sufferers
are our brothers, and they win our sym
pathy as those who have not- been
through the fire never can. To many
Prometheus bound is a subllmer figure
than "Prometheus unbound. Lear, Ham
let, Othello. Ophelia. Cordelia mean far
more to the world than If they had gone
peacefully to the end of their days. la
the suffering and conflict the nobler and
finer elements of human nature are re
vealed. "It-Is Joy and strength to know
that human resolve can laugh at terrors,
and that human love is strongerâ than
death." Then. too. tragedy Idealizes and
sanctifies. One feels the same kind of
emotions In the presence of the tomb of
Romeo and Juliet that Is felt at some
martyr's shrine or In the presence of thÂ«
cross.
world and had not power to make It as he
would?" Times are out of Joint and evil
is triumphant.
his own life he had realized something
of the tragedy of life, something of what
Wordsworth called "the burden of the
mystery of all this unintelligible world."
Whether the sornets give us the clew to
this change in his temperament or not.
It Is certain that he had been reached
and touched by "the shadow of some of
the deep mysteries of human existence."
"Somehow a relation between his soul and
the dark and terrible forces of the world
was established, and to escape from a
thorough investigation and sounding of
the depths of Mfe was no longer possible."
From the depths of a profound experience
and an all but supernatural observation
of life he gave to the world the dramas
extending from "Hamlet" In 1603 to
"Timon of Athens" in 1608â a show of
tragic figures like the kings who passed
before Macbeth. , No one can hope to un
derstand the significance of life or to ap
preciate the full beauty of tragic art who
does not know these plays.
To Shakespeare the problem of evil war.
not a metaphysical problem, as It has
been to many men In this century; It was
a fact to which he did not hope to give a
solution. Knowing the world and human
nature as he did, he realized that no shal
low optimism could fathom the mysterle
of human suffering and the triumph of
evil. ' The optimism of Pope or of Addison
goes down in the midst'of such scenes and
passages as the great dramatist gives us.
, It would be well for the reader to run
through the tragedies with this idea in
mind, leaving aside all other considera
tions, such as plot, characterization, eto.
Every crime and every passion of human
nature is ruthlessly and yet truly present
ed â murder, lust, hypocrisy, â¢ ambition,
envy, selfishness, Ingratitude, "the motive
hunting of a motiveless malignity"â all
are incarnated in living characters; not
abstractions or types, but flesh and blood.
Women are unsexed, children break - the
hearts - of fond parents, families are in
hostility, social life Is corrupt, political
honor Is lost, friend betrays friend, a vil
lain entraps the noblest of men and the
purest of women. It is all there in the
fivirtg hues of art.
.If one thinks of the conclusions of the
tragedies he gets an overwhelming sense
of the tragedy* of the worldâ Hamlet and
Ophelia cut off In the very prime of life,
Brutus unable .to resist the onward sweep
of imperialism.* the tragic loading of the
bed on' which. Othello dies, and above all
the scene in -which the' broken-hearted
Lear comes on the stage,' with his dear
Cordelia In his arms, uttering the sad
dest of. all wails:
And my" poor fool Is hanr'd! No, no, no life!
Why should a dog. a horse, a rat, have life,
Andthou no breath at all? Thou' It come no
Â¦Â¦:; more. /
Never," never. . never, never, never!
I think there can be but little doubt that
"King Lear" rs the greatest of all trag
ediesâcertainly the one In "which the
theme we ; have suggested , may best be
.worked - out " While Hamlet soliloquizes !
on ' the . mysteries of life there is.no suchl
reason for pessimism as we have in Lear. '
Leaving, out Â«pf Â¦ consideration .the fairy
like beginning; which prevents most .read

been better represented and when E. W.
Tucker, D. D. Wass and Frank Bragg,
acting as a committee, -pinned a thrce
bladed propeller with a diamond center
on Chief Little's coat there was u
demonstration. "Archie," as all his
friends call him, is one of the most popu
lar engineers on the Australasian run,
and Dr. J. A. Nelson voiced the opinion
of all when he s=ald: "He is an American
that knows all the fine points of Amer
ican engineering."
While In the East Little will run across

IV,
Charles Darwin was' an omnivorous
reader of novels, but he- liked them to
turn out well, and thought that a law
ought to be passed against novels that
had a tragic conclusion.
Many of the adaptations of * Shakes
peare's plays in the eighteenth century
illustrate the same idea, the most noted
being that of "King Lear," by . Nahum
Tate. Instead of representing Lear as
bringing in the dead body of Cordelia, the
play closes 'with the triumphant marriage,
of Cordelia and Edgar. And the great
Dr. Johnson approved of this change!
And even Mr. Furnivall says: "One can
hardly help wishing that Shakespeare
had followed the old story told by Laya
mon and other repeaters of Geoffrey of
Monmouth, who made Cordelia set her
father on the throne again and reign after
him for awhile in peace." Such criticism
is often heard among amateur critics. A
friend of mine said not long age: "I never
care to see 'Othello' acted again, foe' It is
too horrible. Why don't the poets and
novelists give us pleasing stories? There
Is enough sorrow In the world; they
should take U3 into a world of sunshine
and Joy." . -?. ;
What may be said against such criti
cism of tragedies? Evidently it is^a ques
tion both of Life and of art. The prob
lem of suffering is as old as the world,
certainly as old as the book of Job: what
is the significance of sufferingâ doth a
man serve God for naught? The utili
tarian philosophy of life propounded by
Job's friends is very popular, but it is not
the philosophy adopted by tragic jioets
who learn in suffering what they
in song. The temporary victory of evil
over good la apparent to all who have
ever gone a little way in the study of life.
When looked at from the standpoint of
art it may be claimed that the greatest
art the world has had is that which rep
resents suffering, the conflict between
weak human : nature and inexorable fate
or destiny. Ten Brink says that the es
sence of tragedy is conflict and Dowden
that it is struggle between good and evil.
Students of Shakespeare's plays know
that about 1600 his art began to take on
a new phase; having attained complete
success in comedy and the historical
drama, he began about that time to write
his remarkable series of tragedies. But
this change in style and subject matter
was not arbitrary; in the development of
What causes tragedy? It Is not well al
ways to reducft a play to one abstract
principle, as the German critics used to
do, but it Is interesting to try to account
for the sad end of the tragic figures Why
do Romeo and Juliet meet such a death?
And so with all other sufferers. Evidently
not because they have committed some
sin. as philosophers like the friends of Jol*
would have us believe. I suggest two
ways of looking at such problems. The
tragedy may come as the result of what
Hamlet calls "the dram of eale" in one's
nature, not the result of certain sins, but
the result of certain limitations, certain
defects that under certain conditions will
lead to fatal results; the too great ten
dency In Hamlet to think and not to act:
the excessive emotional nature of Romeo
or Juliet; the lack of penetration into
men's treachery In Lear and Othello; the
excessive pride of Corlolanus. etc. On the
other hand one may find the source of
tragedy in the environment: as the world
Is constituted goodness and highmlnded
nesa do not stand much chance. The lives
of Romeo and Juliet go out because they
are "star-crosstd lovers" and their great
love ccmes in contact with an equally
great and more powerful hate: It Is not
Hamlet's fault, but the fault of his time,
that he cannot find opportunity for the
exercise of his splendid powers; Lear Is
opposed by men and gods and he seems
but their prey. Around these two theo
ries of tragedy has gathered much litera
ture; the truth in all such disputes Is fre
quently with both sides, and it is when we
consider the tragedies from both these
standpoints that we get at the truth, and
this Is why they are so true to life. Aa
man is constituted he has limitations that
prevent the fu'l exercise of his powers;
with all his noble faculties he is yet de
ficient in many things, hampered by the
limitations of his nature; and this is the
pathos of all great men. On the other
hand, the world itself is responsible for
many tragedies. "Why Is all" around us
here as If some lesser god had made the
God waters to the stars that give no man
light, over a world foil of death and Ufa
without resting place or guidance." It
there is one scene more tragic than the
last it is the tempest scene where Lear
speaks to the heavens and the goda. We
seem to be listening to the "torture shriek
or suffering humanity." In the words of
the fool. Gloster, Edgar, Kent and Lear,
we hear "a chorus of passionate. Jeering,
wildly yearning and desperately watlinff
voices." Nature and the gods have Joined
hands with man to bring in the reign of
chaos. In the words of George Meredith.
Humanity looks like an ironic procession
with the laughter of the gods in the
background."
CROWN OF ARCH ROCK WILL BE DESTROYED
IN A FEW DATS AND BASE WILL GO LATER
Soft Stratum Struck and Cylinders Have to Be Used in Order
to Put Explosives in Position to Be EHectiTe.
THE crown of Arch Hock will gro In
a few days and nobody will bo
any the wiser until all is over. All
the necessary preparations have
been made and without any fus3
the arch will be blown away. Not so
with the foundation, however. That will
require months of work, and hard work
at that.
The rock is porous and in order to get
the gun cotton down to the required
depth cylinders have to be used. In these
cylinders a boring machine is used and
in consequence progress is slow.
The contractors have not made as rapid
progress as they expected. Shag Rock
No. 1 is cleared away, but Shag Rock No.

Cash quotations were as follows
NEW YORK, Oct. 24.â To-dey's broad and
active market and the wide fluctuations in
prices offered excellent opportunities for spec
ulation and ail claeses of professional traders
were very busy all day. All the broadly de
fined movements which dominated the aclkn
of the whole market were themselves under
control of powerful epe-culative cliques an-:
there were indications of eo-oi<eration between
the pools which were manipulating dlfferti't
portions of the market. Following this effect
ive leadership and busily occupied in bring
ing forward ( the let* prominent stocks In the
list to conform in prices to the changes in
the leaders was a hest of email traders and
boardroom operators, who were in and out of
the market many times during the day. The
strictly commission-house brukers' clique ha.1
their ful! Bhare of the day's business, orders
coming- in large volume from various tourers.
The latter element offered the effective medium
for suecers of the efforts of the professionals.
That there was a very large selling of stocks
during the day to this outside element became
Increasingly manifest as the day prcgresseil.
When the steady, active buying demand hud
been pretty well satisfied and many of the
professional traders had sold out and taken
their profits they took advantage of the Â».jtt
condition of the market due to the large holJ
trigs of stocks having passed the wealcer hand*
to put out abort lines for a turn. The re
sulting deollne in prices increased the pr;s
eure to realize and the market closed actlv*
and weak at a level materially below the bet,
but with some striking net gains nevertheless
remaining. The backbone of the day's market
consisted of the strength of the transcontinen
tal group of railroads lying beyond the Mis
souri River. Many rumors were afloat tills
morning calculated to etimulate the buying of
these etocks. One Eton' had It that Pacific
Mall had passed to a Harriman-VanderbiU
control as a step In the formation of a great
through transportation line from the Atlantic
seaboard to the coast of Asia. There was also
rather nebulyui reports of a settlement of u
long-standing controversy over the fights :n
the Clearwater territory, in which there has
been a temporary truce between the Northern
Pacific, Great Northern and l.'nlon Pacific. A
lease of the Northern Paclflc by the Great
Northern, with a 4 per cent dividend guaran
tee on the Northern Pacific's common stock. l.Â«
an example of the character of the rumors
which were heard. Northern Pacific and Great
Northern their-selves were sold to realize on
an enortnoUB scale and the former etock, witn
the exception cf a brief Interval, was held
below last night's level all day. but the other
members of the group and Pacific Mail were
very buoyant during the early part of the day.
No oClcial confirmation was forthcoming of any
of the day's rumors and the representatives ot
the Huntington estate distinctly discredited the
allegations regarding change of control in the
Paclflc Mall. That stock, after rising SV i
broke 4\i points, having no small Influence in :
the weakness of the whole list In the late '
trading. Other leaders tn the advance suf-
Ctnd to the extent of 1 to 1% points. Of more
substantial benefit was the news of the en
gagement of an additional Sl.&QO.Odo of gold
*or Import. The J1.C00.000 withdrawn from the
Bank of England to-day I* not likely to flnd
Its destination in New Tork.
There were weak spots In the bond market
to-day and lt did not share fully In the great
activity of the etock market. Total sales, par
value. !2.CS5,000.
United States Government bonds were all ad
vanced M per cent on the lest call.

CHICAGO. Oct. 24. â Wheat started active and
under the influence of a decline of only %@%c
in Liverpool in comparison with the drop of
lV4c here yesterday, in addition to this the
weather in Argentine was reported unfavorable
and Kansas, Ohio and Northern Indlajia com
plained of Hesalan fly. Shorts covered freely
<-arly. December opened %c higher at 73%3J
73c, touched 72?ic. then recovered to 73"io.
Eight hundred and twenty-five thousand
bushels of cash wheat were reported sold here,
but this was at prices said to be 5c under
December. The sample market ww weak, a.
condition explained by - the allegation that
elevators are stuffed full to the eaves. This
weakness, combined with a downward tendency
in corn and the usual lack of outside support,
led to liquidation by commission houses with
a moderate amount of short selling- by bears
under which December later gradually slumped
to 72c. Here the market steadied on covering
by shorts to secure profits. The close wiu
Uc down at 72H<&72Â«,4c for December.
Corn, was heavy, with heavy selling by a
leading operator and continued liquidation by
others. December cloted He down at 35c.
Oats were qulpt and easier. December closed
%c lower at 21*;Â®Zl?4c.
Provisions were generally weak, influenced
by heavy receipts and a break In prices at
the yards and sympathy with the grain weak
ness. There was heavy commission-house sen-
Ing of lard early. The market rallied for a
moment on buying by shippers, but eased olt
again. January pork closed 10c lower, lard ie
down and ribs 2 l Â£c depressed.
The leadlnE futures ranged as follows:

BOSTON. Oct. 24.â The - American Wool and
Cotton Reporter to-morrow will say: .' ' ,
Trade in. wool has continued to Improve and
the business done Is of Â¦ a . more satisfactory
character. That is to say, holders of wool do
not flnd lt to offer so many, sseclal
Inducements to :Â¦ intending purchasers. v It Is
easier for them to get asking prices than â¢ lt
was a month ago. . .The sales of the week, ag
gregate over Â¦ 3,000,000 pounds; and â¢Â¦ this total
would have been considerably increased If hold
ers had consented to accept â¢ all | offers made

strange man at the corner of Bowdltch

was an attempted robbery or the freak
of a crazy man is not known.

ler. When they arrived at Bowdirch
street and Ciiannlns way xhey crossed
diagonally from corner to corner. A man
who had been following them, but to
v,'hom they had paid no attention, walked
at right angles across Channing way and
overtook them at the corner He instant

lady kept her presence of mind and tUrn-
In? quickly around exclaimed; "Scoundrel,
I'll kill you! 1 -
Her coolness and determined air evi
dently frightened the man, for he let go

way.
Mrs. Keith was very reticent about her
part in the affair.
"I do not know whether the man meant
to rob us or not." she said. "At le-ast ho
didn't frighten us. As nearly as I could
tell the man was tall, smooth shaven
and fairly well dressed. I think hÂ« was
rather lleht."

bad associatesâ do well. Lester Reiff is
In better form than ever, has the Income
of a prince, and is the most popular
jockey in England, unless perhaps the
title is disputed by his little brother
Johnny. Tod Sloan reverted to his old
habit of making too many engagements
for one race, and then trying to pick the
most eligible entry. This caused him to
lose caste. "Skeets" Martin became care
less about the company he kept, which
gave him a black eye with aristocratic
owners. Eddie Jones also cultivated some
convivial habits that were not appre
ciated. Jenkins won on .his first three
mounts, and will no doubt become popu
lar. Cash Sloan has rented a house in th<Â»
fashionable part of Paris, 'where he and
hi? wife live in grand style, with Patsy
Freeman and wife as boarders. Patsy
has given a leading French turfman first
call on his services for next season at
JSOOO. and has two very liberal offers for
second and third call tinder consideration.
Not so bad for a boy that was almost
unable to secure a mount at Oakland. In
comparing skill. Durnell .said Loates.
probably the best of England's riders, is
about the equal of Marty Bergen in the
saddle.
It cannot be said the bookies across t&*
pond are "pikers," for John W. Gates won
JS5.00O from one layer of odds alone when
Royal Flush captured the Royal Hunt
cup. The Chicago millionaire cleaned up
J-JOi.OOO altogether over the horse's victory.
Gates was very lavish with his sifts, for
on one occasion when one of Enoch Wish
ard's horses wen a race he sent the latter
trainer a check for JoOOO.
Mentioning 3elling races. "Boots" said
he saw over sixty of these events decided,
and the winner was Invariably bid up;
that beta? the custom over there. After
the result has been announced, the win
ner is led into an lnclosure. where the
auctioneer dilates on the horse's many ex
cellent qualities and future prospects, tha
bidding In some Instances lasting for fif
teen minutes. As the auctioneer receives
a percentage of all "boosts," It Is to that
individual's Interest to secure as large a
price for the animal as possible. It la also
common to see two or three horses
claimed after each race, and no Ill-feeling
Is apparently engendered by such action.
The- owner of the second horse Is entitled
to prior claim. Not unlike the rule In
this country, half of the "run-up" monty
reverts to the association, and half to
the owner of the place horse. The claim
ing clause deprived Ed Corrigan of St.
Caslmir and Adolph Spreckels oa their
first essays.'
While in thÂ© East Durnell purchased
The Kentucktan. The horse will be rested
up down South and shipped across the
Atlantic next ipring. Dr. Sheppard did
not prove a erood traveler, his first ap
pearance in England being reserred for
next year.

Several days ago Miss Donaldina Cam

Mission Home In this city, received in
formation that a Chinese woman named
Woon Ho. now leading the life of a slave
In Sacramento, had been landed at this
port from China about a year ago under
false and fraudulent representations. Miss
Cameron placed herself at once in com
munication with the slave girl and found
that Woon was dissatisfied with the life
ehe was leading and wished to be rescued.
Through the aid of friends in toacra
mento the Chinese girl was taken out of
her master's house and placed in charge
of Miss Cameron, who took her to the
home. In the meantime the Chinese
sought legal aid and were about to apply
for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that
Woon was being deprived of her liberty,
when Miss "Cameron notified Dr. J. E.
Gardner, Chinese Inspector, " who check
mated the highbinders by arresting Woon
on the charge of being unlawfully in the
country*
Woon admitted to Dr. Gardner and Miss
Cameron that she was landed here on the
plea that she was a student.

of Cornelius Lansing Alvord Jr. (not

looted the First National Bank to the ex
tent of 1700,000, Is unknown, and his hand
some home at Mount Vernon is being

In spite of many rumors,; some of them
very circumstantial, it may be positively
stated that the officials of the bank have
no definite Idea just what Alvord did with
the large sura of- money that he: stole.
That much of It -went in high living and
luxuries for his family Is clear, but thÂ»
bank officials believe that less than one*
fourth of his pilferlngs went In that way.
Wall street is full of stories telling how
the defaulter was .' a heavy loser In the
stock market, and although the brokers
refuse to discuss this phase of the matter
there is no doubt that their detectives are
looking into it, and if-Alvord's broker or

"Lftft Xmas I took dinner with a minis-
ter*!? family in New Haven, and although
the spread was elaborate and appetizing
nothing was so heartily held up and ap-
plauded Â£Â« a little saucer of Grape-Xuts
food, standing by the minister's plate. He
said: - "I have taken medicine after medi-
cine, but nothing has brought relief to
body and brain like this food.'
"His wife echoed the sentiments and
Â«aid phe could never tell how much
brighter and braver she had been since
the advent of Grape-Nuts into her home.
"A week later I called to see a widow
who had a broken arm. I expected to
f.nd her disconsolate, but, to my eurprise,
waÂ» greeted with cheerful ezniles. 'Weil.'
I said, 'how I* this? I expected to find
you in the depth* of despondency.* 'Oh,
ro.' ehe paid; 1 could not cook very well
with a broken arm. but with a liltle hot
ir.!!k added to a few spoonfuls of Grape-
Nuts I get a most delicious meal that
builds up my strength by the wholesale,*
"This was the eecond time I had seen
GrapÂ«-Nuts In the character of a public
benefactor. Before night I received my.
third jsrl!rap*Â« of Grape-Nuts, when call-
ing on a little child who had burned her
hand.* Her mother was just preparing a
saucer of strawberries and Grape-Nuts
food. 'Do you like it?* said I. *Oh. don't
IT paid the child- It's bo good it most
males me forget my burn."
"Now I decided I mun have some
Grape-Nut* myself, for if it wa* good for
tirf-d brain and burns and broken arms it
Furelyv ought to benefit my broken nerves;
eo I had a package tent up to the bouse
and have had *ome Grape-Nuts every
morning for breakfast since with this re-
fultâ that nature'* sweet restorer, balmy
e!eep, came back to me. my nerves some-
how quieted down and life took on a dif-
ferent aspect. The old, tired, sleepy reel-
ing haa gone and the air seem* charged
â¢wjth buoyancy.
"I can as easily walk ten blocks as one,
difficult duties are easily accomplished
and all the burdens of life are lightened
by the astoniehlng power of good and well
selected food. I bave taken no medicine
during this time, therefore I can only at-
tribute the agreeable change to the sure
help that conies dally from the use of this

Death Sentences Imposed on Six Sol
diers and Thirteen Filipinos,
All of Wnicn the Presi
dent Oqnunuted.
>
WASHINGTON. Oct. 24.â General LÂ«e
ber, judge advocate general of tha army,
In his report to the Secretary of War,
says there were 6680 trials by general
court-martial during the past fiscal year,
of which number 35 were commissioned
officers, 11 regulars and 24 volunteers; i
cadets. 6618 enlisted men (5424 regulars
and 1134 volunteers) and 23 civilians with
the army. Of the commissioned officers
28 and of the enlisted men 6020 were con
victed. A total of 25S0 men* were sen
tenced to dishonest d!schargÂ«Â«4pf whom
2270 were In the regular army and 315 In,
tha volunteers. Death sentences were
Imposed by sentence of court-martial In
six cases, of enlisted ovenâ one for murder,
four for assaulting Â¦women and one for
striking a superior officer. The death
sentences were commuted by the Presi
dent to discharge, forfeiture of pay and
allowances and imprisonment at hard
labor for twenty years In five cases and
for three years In one caseâ that of strik
ing a superior officer. The death sen
tence was imposed by sentence of a court
martial in one case of a civilian employe
for assaulting a woman and. other of
fenses, which sentence, however, was
commuted to imprisonment at hard labor
for twenty years.' ,
In addition to the foregoing, fifty-eight
persons were tried by military commis
sions during thÂ» year, of which number
forty-two were convicted, fifteen were
acquitted and In one case the sentenco
was disapproved. Death sentences were
imposed by military commissions In thir
teen cases of natives of the Philippine
Islandsâ eight for murder and robbery,
four for murder and one for being a spy.
The death sentence was disapproved In
one case, executed in nve cases and com
muted to imprisonment at hard labor for
twenty years in five cases, for fifteen
years in one case and for ten years In an-
The" Judge advocate general's depart
ment is now composed of eight officers, a
force in the opinion of General Lieber,
entirely insufficient to meet existing re
quirements.
General Lieber recommends the passage
of a bill drafted by him "to prevent the
failure of military justice," which was
favorably reported to the House of Rep
resentatives at the urst session of the
Fifty-sixth Congress, but failed of enact
ment. The first* section of that bill pre
scribes a penalty for civilians who refuse
to appear as witnesses before a general
court-martial of the army when properly
summoned. Another provision ia that
regimental and garrison court-martials
and summary courts shall not have power
to try special cases of commissioned of
ficers. __^____^__â

F(raCEI> TO SEEK j THE
CHARITY OF THE CITY
Nearly Four-Score Years and Ten,
Mary IDoyle Is Evicted
Â¦ From Home.
Mrs. Mary Doyle, 86 years of age, -was
given shelter at the \ Receiving Hospital
last night. With her daughter, Margaret,
she was evicted from a flat at 232 Dore
street, owned by Mrs. Pauline Verhagen,
about 4:30 In the afternoon.
A call for the ambulance was sent in
to the hospital and -when It reached the
scene the decrepit old woman was seat td
on the sidewalk among her earthly treas
ures. She was prevented from accepting
aid by i her daughter, - who Â¦ declared she
"was old enough to take care of her
mother." ... .
Some hours later both mother and
daughter made their appearance at the
Southern police station. Mrs. Doyle, too
old to realize her pitiful condition, seemed
glad to get . out of - the cold nlg-ht~Â» air.
Lieutenant Mooney ee.nt her over to the
police station, where she was made tem
porarily comfortable In front of the stove,
pending her removal to other quarters.
The daughter talked garrulously of her
troubles:
"I only owed this woman the rent from
August 12, $7 a month," she said, "and
then without warning she threw me and
my old mother in the street."
Rattling on, bragging about her "pull,"
denouncing -her neighbors and -. occasional
ly giving a little attention to her mother s
wants, she poured forth , a torrent of In
vective against everything and anybody,
finally leaving to look after her furni
ture.
When Captain Spillane heard of The old
woman's plight he ordered her sent to'tha
Receiving Hospital. The daughter claims
to be married to a grocer on' Harrison
street, but declined to give his name.
Fast living, the gambling craze and lore
of liquor have proved the undoing of
Stephen L. Sullivan of the Ferndale ranch
in Contra Costa County. The young man
is at present in. a bad way, as his business
transactions are- now being Investigated
by the Grand Jury.
Sullivan fell from grace In August of
1S99. He was then associated with Kierce
& Gillogley In the practice of law in the
Claus Spreckels building. Kierce went
East 'as a delegate of the Grand Council
of the Young Men's Institute, and during
his absence Sullivan cut a wide swath, r
When Kierce returned his attention was
called to a request by the officials of the
First National Bank that Sullivan with
draw his business from the bank. Sulli
van had at that time 75 cents in the bank,
and yet was flooding the town with his
checks. That started Kierce to investi
gating. He found that the firm In which
he was a partner had been victimized by
Sullivan in the sum of $800. Sullivan made
a confession, at the same time giving a
chattel mortgage on the hay on his
mother's ranch in settlement. ,
- Sullivan, -after the discrepancies had
been settled satisfactorily moved to Mar
tinez, where he victimized the county of
ficials out of large sums of money. The
place became too warm for him. He then
made Santa Cruz the -field of his opera
tions. Recently he has returned to the
city and haa victimized the local mer
chants right and left. He first made O
F. Willey, the carriage merchant, his vic
tim, lie bought of Willey a carriage for
$300, for which he paid cash.
- He then secured a surrey and buggy, for
which, he'gave his note. Next he traveled
up the line and gave Haas Brothers, the
wholesale grocers, a twirl. They sold him
goods to the amount of $300 and are wait
ing yet. , He thought Brown & Sons, the
stove men. would be good for at least $370
and they hold his note for that amount.
The-Osborne Hardware Company and the
Palace Hardware Company stood for two
notes for $158 and $55' respectively.
Â¦â¢â¢Sullivan decided that the Hastings
Clothing -House 'would be a good place
at which to, trade, but the managers told
him that he could not get any goods with
out the order of his- mother. It did not
take Sullivan long to present his mother's
demand : for - the goods. \ ; Carroll and Neu
;man were; also not overlooked.
,. What the- outcome of Sullivan's finan
cial troubles will, be Is:hard to state but
Just at: present some of ; his merchant
friends would like to have a few minutes'
interview with him. Lawyer Klerce holds
a chattel .: mortgase on the hay crop on
the Â¦ ranch, but parties who have visited
It claim that the hay arid straw is already
sold and moved'off the place.
Sullivan was at one time a member of
the Young' Men's Institute and was ex
pelled from: the order for several charges
preferred against him. â¢
Only, recently, he , married Miss May
Keane. '-Whether his friends will come
forward and assist him In his dilemma re
mains to-be seen. - - .:Â¦; - -.

THE bells that rang out " at the
noon hour yesterday sounded the
tidings that' two loving hearts
were 'being ;i united in ""St.
.; Mary's Church on California and
Dupont streets. Standing at the rail of
the sanctuary. Rev. Father H. H. Wyman
spoke the solemn words that united Miss
Frances H.Â° Slattery. the pretty Postal
Telegraph operator, and Frank Panter, a
wealthy mining man of Shasta County.
The nuptials were witnessed by a large
gathering of friends of the couple. John
W. Mackay, the millionaire president of
the telegraph company, honored his
charming employe by being present at
her marriage ceremony. The cluster of
diamonds which the bride wore on her
wedding gown was a gift, of Mr. Macl#ay.
'To the pleasing strains of Mendel
sohn's wedding march the procession
moved toward the altar. The bride
was escorted by L. W. Storror. superin
intendent of the Postal Telegraph Com
pany. She looked charming in an elab
orate gown designed for her by one of
the lace-makers of Lady Aberdeen's fa
mous factory. It was of real Limerick
lace, made over ruffles of white chiffon.
The bodice was of white chiffon covered
with the rare lace.
Following the bride was Miss Sophie
Folsom. the bridesmaid, prettily attired,
and tho ushers. The groom and his friend.
Thomas Mickel. who acted as best man,
met the procession at the altar; The cere
mony was highly impressive and at its
conclusion the friends gathered about the
couole and tendered their congratulations.
The ushers were Judpre Frank H. Ker
rigan. 'William Derham, John McElroy
and Dudley Kentzel and the intimate
friends of the couple repaired to the home
of the bride at 2129 Jones street and en
joyed a wedding breakfast. Among those
seated at the banquet board were Rev.
Father Wyman, Rev. Father Brady. Mr.
and Mrs. Edward Gllson, Miss Emma
Wells. Thomas Mickel. Miss Sophie Fol
som. Mrs. Taylor. Mr. and Mrs. L. W.
Storror. Mr. and Mrs. William Burke. Mr.

wishes followed the couple as they left
the house. They will return to this city
within a few weeks and then depart for
the East and Europe on an extended tour.
The couple will make their future home in
this city.
Just before departing for the East yes
terday afternoon Bishop Hamilton of the
Methodist Episcopal Church, announced
the appointment of the Rev. Dr. John
Coyle to the position of presiding elder
of the Oakland district. Dr. Coyle suc
ceeds the late Rev. Dr. Robert Bentley.
The appointment will doubtless receive
the unanimous approval of all the
churches in the district, as Dr. Coyle has
long been active in church affairs on both
sides of the bay and has come in con
tact with the leading workers in this con
ference.
The selection of an elder was no easy
task, as there were a dozen or more can
didates, all of whom, the Bishop said,
were qualified to nil the place. By nam
ing Dr. Coyle a pastorate vacancy was
avoided, as the new incumbent Is not per
manently Installed in any particular
church. Si ,
Dr. Coyle Is about SO years of age an-1
was educated In the East. He studied to
be a physician, but after graduating took
up theology and some years- later became
pastor of St. Luke's Church in Newark.
N J He has been actively identified
vi lth Methodist church work In California
for twenty years. He came here from
Newark, N. J. His pastorates have in
cluded the First church of Oakland. Ho
has also occupied the pulpit as pastor at
Berkeley and hl9 List church assignment
was the First M. E. Church at Alameda.
Dr. Coyle was also presiding elder for
San Francisco district. For a year he has
been engaged in secular work. His ap
pointment is received with much satisfac
tion in Oakland, where Dr. Coyle enjoys
the confidence and esteem of preachers
and laity. The Oakland district includes
Oakland. Berkeley and Stockton and a
ntirrow territory to the Oregon State line
along the railroad, exclusive of Sacra
mento. He is now a resident of Alnmeda.

That "respect and esteem" which
prompted Mies Isabella Levy to make
Reuben H. Lloyd, the distinguished attor
ney, her beneficiary to the extent of a
quarter of a million dollars is "Inherited."
Miss Levy said yesterday that "many,
mnny years" of acquaintance with Mr.
Lloyd had cemented her. respect and es
teem for him, but outside of this she had
another and equally as good an incentive
to actuate her in signing the deed which
makes Mr. Lloyd the contingent owner of
all her worldly goods and chattels. "My
mother, Mary Lovy, in her will went fur
ther than to Intimate that I should make
Mr. Lloyd my heir," she said yesterday.
"In her will Mr. Lloyd Mas made sole heir
of all her prcperty in event I should' die
before d^.ith claimed her. It is true that
my mother's estate was..r,nly worth some
thing over $50,000, but under the circum
stances why should not I add my posses
sions with hers as I have done and leave
the same for Mr. Lloyd when death claims
rip. The filing of the deed amply evi
dences my opinion on this point."
; The will of the late Mary Levy corrobo
rated her daughter's Â¦ assertions. Mary
Levy died October 7, 1831, leaving an es
tate valued at SrS.SOO. This estate consist
ed of household furniture, valued at $100:
a lot on Dupont street, near Clay, valued
at Sl?,000: lot on Mason street, near Geary.
$10,000: lot on Hyde street, near Geary,
$7Â»00: lot on Sutter street, near Leaven
worth. $12,000, and a lot on Morton street,
npar Grant avenue, valued at $9000.
In her will, which bears date of May 24,
1S.S2. Reuben H. Lloyd was named as exec
utor, to serve without bonds, for the pur
pore of securing the faithful performance
of. the trust imposed upon him. Isabella
Levy was named cs solo devisee and lega
tee. Xo specific bequest was made to de
cedent's brothers, Benjamin and Jacob L.
Lrvy. nrr to her sister. Gertrude Moch.
Â¦ In event of tho death of Isabella Levy
prior to the death of the testatrix. Mary
Levy. It was provided that Reuben H.
Lloyd should be sole devisee and legatee.
In evont, however, of the death of both
Lloyd and Isabella Levy before her
death, the testatrix provided that one
third of her estate be distributed in equal
shares to the Hebrew, the Protestant and
the Roman Catholic orphan asylums and
the University Mound Old Ladies' Home
of this city; that ?500 go to'John J. Mone
and the balance of the estate to the execu
tor of the will of R. H. Lloyd, if he left
a will; if not, to his heirs at law.
In a codicil drawn a short time later
John J. Mone, Philip N\ and Ernest L.
Lilienthal were named as executors of
the will to serve In event of the death of
both Mr. Lloyd and decedent's daughter.
They never assumed the office of adminis
trators, however, for both Miss Levy and
Mr. Lloyd survived the testator. Dece
dent's estate was distributed to her
daughter, and, as the executor of the will,
Mr. Lloyd paid a monthly' allowance, in
accordance with the terms of decedent'8
will, to her sister, Gertrude Moch, to
whom, however, none of the estate was
ever distributed, she having been disin
herited, save for an allowance of $50 a
month.
Isabella Levy, though she was possessed
of considerable money at the time of her
mother's death, put that ' which she re
ceived from decedent's estate to Rood use.
She Is regarded as one of the .shrewdest
real estate speculators, in San Francisco.
By her own efforts she has Increased her
fortune to enviable proportions and when
death claims her all that she has sained
by her tireless efforts will go to him whom
she admire?â Reuben H. Lloyd.
Mr. Lloyd refused to communicate Mb
vlewa on the good fortune which has be
fallen him. "The transaction was a pure
ly a private one," he said, "and Is our
business alone; not that of the press or
the public.'' .
