their majority in both the Senate and the
House of Representatives. The State of New York
has gone Republican by a plurality of at least 150,
000. Benjamin B. Odell Jr. has been elected Governor,
and the entire Republican State ticket has won by plural
ities of probably 40,000 less than that given for the Presi
dential Electors. In beautiful landslide weather, Bryan,
Croker, Jones and Stone have gone out of sight in a per
fect deluge of Republican votes. Instead of rolling up 8o,
000 plurality for Bryan in greater New York, Croker roll
efrvp less than 28,000. The actual figures computed at this
hour are 27,437 for the Greater City. Croker gives Bryan
28,240 in Manhattan and Bronx, 19,904 in Queens and
695 in Richmond.
On the other hand, McKinley carries the borough of
Brooklyn by 349,.

Mr. Bryan hopes to be elected to the Senate from Ne
braska if McKinley goes to the White House. Tl^e indica^
tions are that while McKinley is surely going to the White
House Mr; Bryan is not likely to go to the Senate. The
latest reports are that the fusion legislative ticket in Ne
braska is weak, and that the Republicans may have the
Legislature.
BRYAN MAY NOT REACH SENATE.
Connecticut is Republican by 25,000, and McLean (R.) is
elected Governor, running 10,000 behind his ticket. New
Jersey's swelling. figures at this hour, are up to 65,000 and
may reach the wonderful plurality of 87,000, which the
State gave four years ago. Delaware, Maryland 'and West
Virginia are all in the Republican column again, all these
States having been indicated as likely to go for McKinley
in The Call's forecast. The Republican majority in the
House of Representatives is likely to be at least 35. The
Republicans in the present House have 186 and the op
position 168. It is just possible that Mr. Bryan may have
to remain in private life, and if he is to keep before the
public he must continue on the lecture platform.
In and around New York State the McKinley wave
rolled almost as high as it did in the Middle West. The
New-England States -pre sent * a solid 'Â¦Â¦ sound money- front/
rality of 300,000 for McKinley. Texas, on the other hand,
reports a plurality of 215,000 for Bryan. Illinois, which
Mr. Bryan was led 1 to suppose was doubtful ten days ago,
has given to McKinley a plurality of 180,060. In 1896 it
gave him a plurality of 142,000. Wisconsin, which in 1896
gave to McKinley a plurality of 102,000, now swells it to
115,000. Indiana goes for McKinley by 30,000. Kansas,
which The Call predicted would go for McKinley, gives
signs clearly indicating no change of three weeks ago, and
has gone for the Republican ticket by a landslide among
the Populists and grangers. . <

TREMENDOUS VOTE POLLED.
Returns from some of the States are very late coming in.
For instance, Kentucky and Nebraska are considered
doubtful States at this hour, simply because the returns
are meager. The indications are that McKinley has a little
the better of it in Nebraska, while Bryan's chief newspaper
supporter in Kentucky has given up the State.
Richard. Croker late this evening sent a telegram to
William J. Bryan at Lincoln, Nebr., saying that New York
County had done the best it could for him, but that he un
doubtedly knew the result by this time, and concluding:
"We are defeated.' but not discouraged." ,
Mr. Croker in a statement to-night said that he could
not say what was the cause of Bryan's defeat. He declared
that the Democrats in New York had done everything in
their power for Bryan, arid that Bryan was a natural leader
of men and would be heard from again.
GOOD NEWS CAUSES GREfiT JOY
The reception of the news of McKinley 's triumph in
New York was attended by signs of unexampled enthusi
asm. Never before did such crowds throng Herald
square, and six other points at which Herald bulletins
were displayed. The crowd literally went wild after the re
turns indicating McKinley's great victory had been dis
played. /
umn, but the fate of Senator Pettigrew is in doubt, the Rc
publicans making a desperate effort to capture the Legisla
ture so as to prevent his return to the Senate, and the fu
sionists, aided by a gerrymander, making a hard fight to
carry the Legislature and re-elect him.
Senator Jones, chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, at an early hour last night conceded the elec
tion of McKinley. In to-day's landslide even Nevada hunÂ£
in the balance. Bryan carried the State by about 8oo.
which is a remarkable change from four years ago, when
he had a plurality of 6439. It is believed that Nevada will
elect Farrington (R.) to the House of Representatives.

The Courier-Journal at midnight says
returns from two-thirds of the counties

majorities. The result will depend on the
size of the majority in the Eleventh Con
gressional District, which ia heavily Re
publican.
"Official returns from twenty-eight coun
ties have been received. In these counties
Beckham for Governor has gained 1039
over Goebel last' year, while Yerkes has
gained 1302 over Taylor in the same coun
ties last year. Jefferson County (Louis
ville) is not included In this estimate. This
indicates that Yerkes has been elected by
a safe majority. In the Presidential race
McKinley has probably run 1200 behind
Yerkes in the same counties."
"Bryan and Beckham have carried Ken
tucky by safe majorities. The Democrats
have elected nine out of the eleven Con
gressmen, including Gilbert In the Eighth,
Kehoe in the Ninth and Rhea In the Third
districts."
Chairman Combs of the Republican
State Committee said:
LOUISVILLE. Nov. 6.â At 10 o'clock

ported the Democratic or Republican

are claiming gains In the State.
LOUISVILLE. Nov. 6.â At midnight the
result of the election in Kentucky was in

MICHIGAN.*
President McKinley has carried the
the. State by. about 80,000. a reduction of
nearly a hundred thousand from that of
four years ago. The Republicans have
elected ten Congressmen. While the total
vote for Governor was behind that given
the national candidate. W. M. Crane was
re-elected by a larger plurality than that
received by President McKinley. The Re
publican vote showed a net loss of about
15 per cent.
BOSTON. Nov. 7.â The plurality in this
city of 8466 for Bryan, with one precinct
to be heard | from, came as the surprise
of the election in Massachusetts. Bryan
polled throughout the city 44,813 votesâ
that is, 14.999 more votes than he received
four years ago. This is a gain of about
50 per cent for the Democratic Presiden
tial candidate. McKinley's support was
36,347, which was a loss of 24 per cent over
1S96. Bryan ran very, strongly in Repub
lican wards and seemed to lose in several
Democratic wards.
MASSACHUSETTS.
McKinley carried Baltimore city by 6995.
The returns -from the counties are mea
ger, but official advices from eighty-one
scattered precincts out of 354 give Mc-
Kinley 18,285, Bryan 16,19"). assuring Mc-
Kinley a majority of at least 10.000 in the
State. The defeat of the Democrats has
been thorough and surprising, it being
thought certain that they have lost five
of the six Congressmen, with the proba
bilities In favor of a clean sweep by the
loss of the other. The doubtful district is
the Second, in which Congressman J. F.
C* T.ilbot Is the Democratic candidate and
A. Blankeney the Republican aspirant.
The returns, with one precinct missing,
show a majority for Blankeney. and it is
regarded as. probable that he is elected.
This means a net loss of two Congressmen
to the Democrats, the Fourth and First
districts having been represented by Dem
ocrats, though Governor John W. Smith,
who was elected in the First, resigned
soon afterward to become Governor of
the State. His business partner. State
Senator. John P. Moore, was nominated
by the Democrats to succeed him, and
his defeat was a source of great surprise,
It being considered that he was practical
ly sure of election.
BALTIMORE. Nov. 6.â McKinley has
carried Maryland, beyond the shadow of
a doubt, the only question to be settled
being the size of his majority. With prac
tically complete returns from the city he
has a majority here of about 6500, while
from the State scattering returns indicate
an additional surplus of 3500, making his
toial majority in the State about 10,000.
There is no reason to believe the final
figures will vary greatly from those given
above. Chairman Vandiver of the Demo
cratic State Committee admits Bryan's
defeat in the State, while Chairman Golds
borough of the Republican Committee
says that McKlnley's majority will reach
14,000 at least. It is also certain that the
Republicans have elected four of the six
Congressmen, while the remaining two
will probably be Democratic, although
later returns may change this outlook.
MARYLAND.
Out of seventeen counties in the Elev

"Mr. Odell has apparently not received

RESULT OF A STRAW VOTE.
NEW YORK. Nov. 6.â Senator Thomas
C. Platt gave out the following state
ment at 10:30 to-night:
"At this hour it is apparent that the
plurality for McKinley and Roosevelt
above the Bronx River is not less than
155,000. and may easily exceed that figure
by 10,000. Greater New York ia against
us in the neighborhood of 30,000, and.
therefore, we are confident of the State
by nearly 150.000 for the national ticket.
It may slightly exceed that amount
Night.
Flatt Makes Estimate Early in the
to the Result.
NEW YORK. Nov. 6.â Governor Roose
velt, surrounded by his family, to-night
received the returns at his home on the
Sagamore Hill*. The Governor at no time
during the evening seemed anxious about
the result. He did not make any special
arrangements to receive the news and
depended on messages to be brought from
the telegraph otrtce nearly three miles
away. The first definite information of
the Republican victory was conveyed to
the Governor at about U> o'clock. He was
in the reception room with his wife and
daughter. When he appeared at the door
to meet a reporter he was clad in full
evening dress. He invited his visitor Into
the parlor and closely scrutinized the re
turns and briefly commented on the re
sult. After reading the message he said:
"Isn't that fine? It shows what the
American people are. It shows they want
the good times to continue and are la
favor of honest money and are for the
fag."
The Governor at once dictated the fol
lowing dispatch to President McKinley:
"To President William McKinley. Can
ton, Ohio: I congratulate you and the
nation. You have my heartfelt gratitude
over the result.
"THEODORE ROOSEVELT."
The Governor also sent messages of con

McKinley and Roosevelt 50.000 plurality.
The Democrats have succeeded in carry

sixteen Republicans to four Democrat*,

as last year.

OMAHA, Nov. 7.-At 2 a. m. 235 pre
cincts had been heard from and with the
later returns come figures which encour
age iÂ».e fusionists in their claim that
Bryan will carry the State by a small
plurality. They at least indicate that the
early gains reported for McKinley will
be materially cut down by returns from
the agricultural districts. Some change
has also been noted in the Legislative re
turns from Douglass County, which- has
the largest Assembly District delegation
in the State, and which has always been
Republican. The latest reports from ward
precincts in Omaha favor the fusionists
and they now hope to elect at least a part
of their twelve candidates for the two
houses.' ' i .,: - -'Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦
Chairman Hall of the Democratic State
Central Committee was reticent with re
gard to the result and refused to give any
figures. Chairman Lindsay of the Re
publican State Central Committee said
all their returns indicate a complete Re
publican victory with a plurality of from
8000 to 10.00Q for McKinley. with no defi
nite returns on the State ticket and the
Legislature.
Although not a factor, the Prohibition
ticket shows a gain over four years ago.
iUwill require a pretty full count to de
termine the complexion of the Legislature,
and both sides are claiming a majority

State, would indicate Republican plural
ity of from 2000 to 5000. However, the
Fusionists say these returns are not sig
nificant of the real result and that the
outlying districts will overcome these
gains and give the State to Bryan by from
5000 to 8000. The result of the vote on the
national ticket will no doubt' also deter
mine the victories on the State ticket,
both running very close together.

How the Democratic Candidate Spent
RESULT PUTS BRYAN TO SLEEP.
the Day at His Home.
LINCOLN. Neb., Nov. 6.â Mr. Bryan re
ceived election returns at his residence in
this city. His house was fairly overrun
by newspaper men and telegraph opera
tors. Not only was the tirst floor of the
house largely given up to them, but two
of the rooms on the second story also.
Four telegraph wires ran to the house.
Mr. Bryan had with him Â¦ his brother,
Charles Bryan, his former law partner;
ex-State Senator Talbot, National Com
mitteeman Dahlman and Attorney
Schmidt. Mrs. Bryan had as companions
a cousin, Mrs. Rogers and Mrs. Dahlman.
Mr. Bryan took his dinner at a little
Â¦ after 6 o'clock and later spent a few min-
I utes in conversation with the newspaper
i men, referring to the bulletins received
i and asking some questions about dlffer
| ent States, but without venturing any
I opinion upon the figures. The Jirst bulle
i tin was the one announcing that Pough
i keepsie, N. Y.. had given McKinley a ma
jority of 1337 and tniÂ» was quickly fol
lowed t>y another bulletin to the effect
that Elmira had gone in Mr. Bryan's
favor to the extent of 1722 majority.
' When shown the message he pimpiy re*
; marked that it was encouraging.
The other bulletins from |\"ew York
j came 'In thick and last after that and
i while Mr. Bryan made no comment there
i was a feeling among tnose present that
Â¦ he was disappointed in jhe returns from
New York city and Brooklyn. His re
' ports up to the last concerning those
cities had been encouraging and his own
observation had led him to believe that
there would be a large Increase in his
vote rather than a loss. On the other
hand, there was considerable encourage
ment from the Interior of New York State
and especially gratifying was a message
from National Commltteeman Mack, say
ing that Buffalo had given McKinley a
majority of only 3000 against 12,000 tour
years ago. Coming close upon the heels
( of the Buffalo dispatch was one from a
j friend in Boston announcing that that
1 city had gone for Bryan by a majority of
I 70w as against 17,000 for McKinley four
| years ago.
The early dispatches indicated the loss
of Maryland and this was also a disap
pointment, for it had been believed that
that State was fairly safe for the Demo
cratic ticket.
After receiving the earlier returns in his
library In the midst ot his friends, Mr.
liryan retired to his private apartments,
which were connected with tne outside
world by a special wire. Both he and
Mrs. Bryan were in a cheerful mood and
a person unacquainted with the circum
stances would never- have dreamed that
they were at this time the center of na
tional interest.
At 8 o'clock when the newspaper men
congregated at Mr. Bryan's house sought
to Fecure a statement from Mr. Bryan
they were told that he had just gone to
sleep and could not be disturbed. When
he retired to his room he glanced over
the returns with apparent interest and
then expressing a desire to make up for
some of the rest he had lost in the past
few weeks, lay down and was fast asleqp
in less than rive minutes. He had slept
an hour In the afternoon, after which he
went /or a horseback ride to his farm
He did not, however, feel fully recuper
ated and therefore sought additional rest,
thus manifesting probably less concern
than hundreds of thousands of his fol
lowers.
Mr. Bryan remained In his private
j apartments during the entire evening nnd
j slept the 'greater part of the time. Â¦ He
did not make his appearance in the par
lor of his house, where the newspaper
corre?pondents were congregated, until
11 o'clock, and his coming at that time
was for the purpose of notifying the press
that he would have nothing â¢ to say for
publication during the night. He added
canteen policy and liquor interests in
our .foreign possessions and his election
will have the effect of bringing the liquor
question to an issue. The Prohibitionists
looked upon the Democratic party in re
cent years as a sort of a sham, which
stcod in the way of reform. We feel in
better shape now to press the fight
against liquor than if Bryan had been the
successful candidate. If Bryan had been
elected we would have had to change our
whole line of attack.
"As it Is we are inclined to felicitate our
selves on the result from the standpoint
of our party, for the returns show in fa
vor of the Prohibition party throughout
the United States and we face exactly the
same conditions unchanged from what
they have been during past years. The
general returns up to 10 o'clock indicate
more than a doubling of the prohibition
vote over 1S96."
John G. Wooolley. Prohibition national
candidate, said he would leave for New
York in the latter part of this week to
continue his campaign against the liquor
question. The campagin w'll be main
tained steadily during the next four years,
he said, during which time he will tour
the country. In 1901 special attention will
be given to Ohio. Iowa, Virginia, Rhode
Island and Oregon and States that hold
elections that year.
VOTING IN PHILIPPINES.
New York the Only State That Gives
Soldiers a Chance.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 6.â New York is
the only State which has given its soldiers
lighting in the Philippines an opportunity
to exercise the right of suffrage. West
Virginia at one time contemplated send
ing commissioners to the Philippines to
supervise the voting of its sons, but the
War Department Is not advised that It
carried out this intention. There are more
than 30,000 volunteers in the Philippines,
and about 3S.OO0 regulars. The department
Is not informed what regulations have
been promulgated by the New York Com
missioners relative to the qualifications of
voters, but it is presumed they are in ac
cordance with the laws of the State. It
is estimated that several thousand men
enlisted from New York State, and If any
of the Congressional election districts are
close, especially those In the vicinity of
Fort Niagara, where the F'orty-second
Regiment was recruited, the vote of the
soldiers in the Philippines will have an
important effect. The vote of the soldiers,
when cast, will be sealed and delivered at
Albany, where It will be counted. Offi
cials of the department gay that the Fed
eral Government could, of course, take no
action to Insure the voting of. troops on
foreign service. This was a matter, it is
said, which the States themselves should
have attended to, and surprise is ex
pressed that more States did not follow
the example of New York and send Com
missioners to Manila. It Is possible, the of
ficials concede, that other States may have
sent Commissioner?, but they believe that
in this event they would have been in
formed of it.

WRONG BALLOTS ARE USED.
Mistake at Albany^ Many Cause the
Throwing Out of 326 Votes.
ALBANY,. N. Â¦ Y.. Nov. 6.â The sensa
tional feature of the election here was a
mistake which happened in the Eleventh
.Ward; and which may result In the throw
ing out of 326 votes. The City Clerk in dis
tributing the ballots sent those marked
for the first election district of that ward
to the third election district and the bal
lots for the latter district to the former.
The mistake was not discovered until 1S6
of- the ballots had been cast in the' first
district and 140 In the third district. The
Democratic workers find watchers filed
with the Inspectors of Election in both
districts a protest to the counting of these
votes. '
JOY AT NATIONAL CAPITAL.
Re-election of McKinley. Causes Dem-
onstrations on Streets.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 6.â The jubilation
here over President McKinley's re-elec
tion broke all bounds. Never except at
Inauguration times, did such crowds
surge up and down Pennsylvania avenue,
cheering, singing and blowing* horns.
In the absence' of. the* President, there
was- no gathering at the . White House,
and such advices as were received there
were conveyed by telephone to members
of the Cabinet now In Washington. Only
three are hereâ Secretaries ' Hay. Gage
and Root, the latter reaching the city
during the evening, after casting his bal
lot in New York. Secretary Hay was
feeling indisposed and remained at his
home during the evening, but Secretary
Gage was at the Treasury Department,
and with a number of friends heard the
results there.
At the Av ar Department Secretary Root,
General Miles and Adjutant General Cor
bin were on hand and remained until late
in the evening. At Republican and Dem
ocratic headquarters officers of commit
tees were engaged in figuring on the com
plexion of the next House of Representa
tives. Loudenslager was In charge ot
Republican headquarters and Chairman
Richardson of the Democratic.
GREAT BRITAIN GRATIFIED.
Comment on the Result of the Elec
tions in the United States.
LONDON. Nov. 7.â The weakness of
American securities on the Stock Ex
change yesterday was a reflection of tha
strong interest taken here in the Ameri
can election and the recognition that, al
though the success of McKlnley'was re
garded as almost certain the contest pre
sented all kinds of possibilities owing to
the complexity of issues before the Amer
ican public.
Additional interest was lent for the Eng
lish observers by the near conjunction
with their own elections, which also
turned almost wholly on the question of
imperialism.
The morning papers went to press toa
early to be In a position to comment on
the result, but all published editorials and
elaborate dispatches depicting the pro
press of the contest. All are impressed
by the comparative fewness of disorders..
The Daily Chronicle says: "Considering
the excitement over the enormous elec
toral area the tranqutlity of thi3 great
contest is remarkable." . .
The Standard: "There can be no reason
able doubt that President McKinley has
been re-elected. Isolated cases of tumult
should serve only to emphasize the ad
mirable spirit and common citizenship
with which the people of the republic play
their part in the engrossing struggle for
the mastery. It is significant that racial
animosity was the cause of the worst con
flict."
The Standard goes on to express the
frankest satisfaction over the success of
McKinley, adding: "This success In
sures a continuance of the stability in
money matters and no change in the for
eign policy of the United States. The
triumph of Mr. Bryan would have been
felt everywhere as heralding a sharp re
versal of the policy which has made the
United States a powerful and energetic
member of the great family of nations."

CANTON, Ohio, Nov. 6.â President Mc-

ing. Shortly before that time he came
from the McKinley residence, accom
panied by Judge Day. Dr. Rlxey, Post
master George B. Frease and Charles R.
Miller, of, Canton, and Secretary Cortel
you. .A number of people had gathered
in front of the house and the President
shook hands with many and! exchanged
pleasant greetings. Down Market street
he and Judge Day walked at the head of
the party and the President was kept
busy raising his hat to the many greet
ings along the way. The windows of one
of the factories were crowded with work
men, who gave him a cheer as he passed.
At the voting place quite a crowd hail
collected to see the President cast his
vote. He shook hands with some of the
officials and then stood while the ques
tions reauired by law were asked. His
registry number was '3)2 and his was the
ninety-seventh ballot cast in a total vot
ing strength of 333. The President re
mained at the booth fully a minute, scan
ning the ticket before casting it into th->
ballot box. The President marked his
ballot so as to vote the entire Republi
can column.
Judge Day then voted and the party
started 'back to ; the house, receiving
further friendly demonstrations along
the way. Ths President received dis
patches from New York leaders early to
day, saying a large vote had been polled
by 8 o'clock and expiessing strong con
fidence in the result.
LINCOLN, Neb., Ncv. 6.â Mr. Bryan
cast his vote at 11:10 o'clock. The cere
mony was witnespe-i bv a half hundred
residents congregated near the booth and
a dozen or more newspaper men followed
Mr. Bryan. Before foing to the voting
place, Mr. Bryan repaired to the City
Hall, where he filled out a certificate
stating that he had failed to register bo
cause of absence from the city. Tha
clerk at the City Hall who supplied him
with a certificate also dispensed to all
who would receive them yellow badge3
bearing the inscription, "I am a Republi
can." and he seemed ciuite as much oc
cupied with one duty as the other. There
was quite a procession from the City
Hall to the voting place, consisting of
citizens and newspaper men In carriages
and a number of Mr. Bryan's neighbors
on foot, who escorted him to the voting
place.
CLEVELAND, Nov. 6.â Senator Hanna
arrived this morning from Chicago and
was driven directly to his home. Subse
quently he deposited his ballot. It re
quired only a few seconds for the Senator
to mark and fold his ballot, which was
taken to mean that he had voted a
(straight ticket.
INDIANAPOLIS. Nov. 6.â Benjamin
Harrison walked to a booth three blocks
away from his home and voted.' The
crowd made way for the former President,
who was Inside the booth only a short
time.
BLOOMINGTON, 111., Nov. 6.â Adlal E

Say Election of McKinley Is a Boon
"CHICAGO, Nov. 6-â Prohibition Na
tional Chairman Oliver "\v. Stewart said
to-night: "The outcome of the election is
no surprise.' nor is it. a disappointment.
The election of . McKinley will tend - to
focalize the sentiment of the people on the
saloon question. He is committed to the
that he might possibly give out a state
ment to-morrow.
After this assurance the visitors to the
house withdrew and soon afterward the
Hants were extinguished nnd the house
presented no signs of animation. Mrs.
Bryan spent the evening entertaining her
company and gave no signs of fatigue or
disappointment. The belief Is quite gen
eral that Mr.. Bryan will say to-morrow
that he does not doubt the election for
the second time of his rival, for while
he has given no direct utterance of such
concession he Indirectly admits to-night
to friends that he does not hope for more
than to rcduco the Republican majority In
some of the Eastern States.
McKINLEY HEARS RETURNS.
At His Canton Home the Executive
Arrested- for Illegal Voting.
DECATUR, Ind., Nov.; 6.-Pearl. Cutting
Learns the Result.
CANTON, Ohio, Nov. 6.â President Me-
Klnley received the election returns to
night at his home, surrounded by a
large number of his old friends and
neighbors. Including many ladles who
came as the guests of Mrs. McKinley, to
share with her the interest^ and excite
ment of this culminating efent of the
campaign.
Direct wires connected the house with
the Republican National Headquarters at
New York and at Chicago, with Senator
Hanna at the Union Club in Cleveland,
and with the home of Governor Roose
velt at Oyster Bay, so that the President
was in constant telegraphic touch with
his associate on the ticket and with the
campaign leaders.
The President made his headquarters
in his library, where most of the gentle
men guests congregated, while Mrs: Mc-
Kinley entertained the ladles in the par
lor. The President was in his good
humor, showing no signs of anxiety over
the result.
The President in person read aloud
some of the returns, but refrained from
making any comment whatever on the
result and accepting with unruffled com
posure the favorable reports which be
gan to come in at an early hour. Sec
retary Cortolvou read most of the dis
patches, some of the more cheering an
nouncements being heartily applauded
by the guests. Most of the early advices
were fragmentary and inconclusive, but
the strong indications that New York
and probably Illinois had gone for Mc-
Kinley were received with great satis
faction.
At 9 o'clock the President received a
dispatch from an enthusiastic Individual
that New York and Illinois carried the
day for McKinley and that he was re
elected.
The responsible leaders made no early
claims, although their dispatches told of
gains at many points and .breathed the
spirit of victory near at hand.
The President's . first congratulations
from headquarters came from J. H. Man
ley at New York, as follows: "Praise
God. from whom all blessings flow. Your
triumphant re-election Is conceded by
Democratic managers. I tender my
earnest congratulations. We are very
happy at headquarters."
At midnight Canton was in a frenzy of
enthusiasm which knew no bounds. The
crowds which had been burping red tire
downtown marched to the McKinley. resi
dence with bands playing, rockets sending
lurid streaks across the midnight sky and
tumultuous cheers, mingled with the din
of horns and steam whistles. The crowd
was stilled for a time with some of the
cheering news received.' This included
dispatches 'from Kansas, claiming, that
State by 40.000; f rom. Secretary H p ath of
the National' Committee, saying Indiana
pave McKinley 29,000 plurality; from the
Iowa- chairman, saying- Iowa's plurality
was 100.000, and from- the Union- League

ored for the President and he appeared,
waving his acknowledgment of the deaf

"Fellow citizens: . I thank you for the
very great compllmtnt of this call on this

DENVER, Nov. 6.â Two men dead and
four wounded, one of whom will proba
bly die, is the result of a clash which oc
curred early to-day between members of
the police force and a posse of Deputy
Sheriffs at a polling place at Twenty-sec
ond and Larimer strfets in the down
town district. Charles Allen, a negro
Deputy Sheriff, was shot and Instantly
killed, and Stewart Harvey, white, a
special policeman, died in the afternoon
at the County Hospital.
Fifteen hundred special policemen had
been sworn in for the day and about 1009
fpecial deputies. At 7 o'cloclf Special
Policemen Charles F. Carpenter anrt
Green were sent to 1 wenty-second and
Larimer streets to supervise the opening
of the polls in District H, Precir.ct four.
Several special deputies were present.
Orders had been issued by the Fire an-1
Police Board to refuse to recognize the
authority of the deputies, and to axre3t
any one who in any way interfered with
tne police.
Under these instructions Officer Car
penter ordered the deputies to -retire
to 100 feat from the polls. Hampscm
Jackson, colored, resisted, anu drawing
a revolver began shooting". One bullet
struck Carpenter's arm and a second his
foot. Policeman Green, came to the res
cue of his companion, striking Jackson
on the head and arm. fracturing his skull
and breaking his arm. The blow broke
the heavy oak club the officer carried.
Shooting by the deputies became gen
eral, while the special police, who were
armed only with clubs, were at a disad
vantage. At this moment City Detective
Ed Qarbery ran up and opened fire wun
his revolver. killing Deputy SheriiT
Charles Allen, colored. ' with the first
shot. A score of shots were fired by thÂ«
deputies and Detective Carbery, and
Deputies Stewart Harvey (whlte> and
Richard Hardman (.colored) were shot,
the former in the right shoulder and tho
latter In the left arm. Harrey died thla
afternoon in the hospital.
The feeling created by the affair of thla
morning is intense. Yesterday Judge Hal
lett of the United States District Court
issued an order forbidding the United
States Marshal to appoint any Deputy
Marshals to serve at the polls, but the
charge is made by the Police Department
that a large number of Deputy Shentfa
were sworn in and armed at his office.
Said Police Commissioner Robert W.
Speer to-day: â¢
"Four hundred negroes, many of them
with long records for desperate deeds,
were sworn in as Deputy Sheriffs in the
office of United States Marshal Bailey in
the Federal building and given badges
and pistols. The special officers appointed
by our board were unarmed, except with
clubs, and ordered not to use violence ex
cept in extreme cases."
The trouble is the outgrowth of the btt
ter campaign ln> Denver and the StatÂ»Â»
which involves not only the national and
State tickets but the election of a United
States Senator to succeed Senator Wal
cott.
The Police Department, which is con
trolled by the Democrats and Sheriff Rob
ert Jones, who was elected as a Democrat
but who is said now to favor the Repub
licans, at the request of the Honest Elec
tion League (composed, it is charged, ex
clusively of Republicans) issued a very
large number of Deputy Sheriff commis
sions to men named by the league.
Yesterday the Board of County Commis
sioners, in disregard of an order of Judgo
Butler of the District Court, revoked the
commissions given by Sheriff Jones, and
though the court promptly took action
against the Commissioners for contempt,
the Fire and Police Board, acting on the
advice of leading attorneys, decided to
disregard the authority of the deputies.
Although Troop C. Colorado National
Guard, assembled early at the armor)' and
remained under arms throughout the day.
and It -was understood to nave been by
order of Governor Thomas. The Governor
this afternoon positively denied having is
sued such orders, and the officers of the
trcop refused to say by whose orders they
were assembled.
Ex-Mayor T. S. McMurray. chairman of
the Honest Election League, tnls evening
offered a reward of $5000 ' lor the, arrest

One of the striking features of tl<e I
NE"W YORK. Nov. 6â President
McKinley will begin his second
terra with both houses of Con
gress strongly Republican. Re
turns from the States which
legislatures which elect United
States Senators indicate that the Repub
lican majority in the Senate will be at
least as large as It is now.
The House cf Representatives has been
carried by a veritable Republican land
slide. Republican gains have not been
confined to any one section of country.
East. West and even South have contrib
uted to an Increased Republican major
ity. Districts have been carried that even
the Republican managers were disposed
to concede to the Democrats. Returns
frcm the legislative tickets In several of
the States are delayed, making it impossi
ble to give exact Sgures as to the strength
cf the parties in the new Senate. One of j
the most interesting Senatorial situations i
is in Nebraska. Senator Allen, Populist, \
ails one of the seats by appointment of j
the Governor, which holds g-oud only until !
the meeting of the Legislature. The term !
of Senator Thurstcn (R.) will expire in |
March. Thus the Nebraska Legislature j
veVi have to elect two Senators.
A fusion legislature would return Sena- I
tor Allen and would elect Mr. Bryan to ]
succeed Senator Thurston. If later re- j
turns bear out the indications of earlier I
dispatches frcm Nebraska Mr. Bryan has
Dot only been defeated for the Presidency j
but will be kept out of the Senate a_Â« well j
The Pennsylvania Legislature will be j
strongrly Republican. The supporter? of
former Senator Quay claim that hi? fac
tion will be in the majority and that he
will be leturned to the Senate. The ar>ti-
Cjuay men will not concede this, and
there is every prospect of a bitter fac
tional tight when the Legislature meets |
in Harrisburg. There will also be a con- j
test in the Illinois Legislature between i
Governor Tanner and Senator Cullom for
the seat which the latter now fills. The
probability is that some compromise can
didate trill be elected.
In the House the most important gains
have oeen in the Cast, New York,
Pennsylvania and Maryland being- the j
ehiÂ«-f contributors. The West is so strong
ly Republican in the present House that
no material gains could be expected i:i
that direction. From the South little was
expected, but the return? indicate that :
the Democratic majorities have been
greatly reduced in Virginian districts, I
and probably one or more Republicans
have been elected from that State. Ken- |
tucky, which has two Republicans in the i
present House, will show a substantial :
Iner^ftpe, and the Republicans have at I
least hold their own in Virginia, Tenner- i
tm-mberrtilp of the nÂ«rw Congress i.Â« i
the Fir.uli number of Populists, Sil

Houfc ThÂ«Â» election of to-day letni to
indicate t^at the Popollst party has ceased
to be an important factor in the politics
of the country. The tier of States west of
the Mississippi in which Populism had its
greatest development have returned tem- [
porarlly at least to the Republican co!- !
umn.

hope. Frirfk, Republican candidate for

WOLFE REPUDIATED
BY REPUTABLE VOTEBS
Citizens of All Parties Unite to Force
Little electioneering was done lirslde the
100-foot limit. The police had been In
structed not to permit this violation of
the election law, and they carried out
their orders to the letter. Martin Kelly
was conspicuous in the Twenty-elzhth and
Twenty-ninth districts. He was pleased to
say that everything was going very nicely.
In the Thirty-first and Thirty-second
districts, which embrace the south side
from Seventeenth street to Eighth, elec
tion day passed off with but little to dis
tinguish it from any other day of the
week. A heavy vote was cast. A rough
estimate placing It at more than two
thirds of the registration.
All day long, and the day was sultry.
scores of men formed scouting parties to
the various corner groceries, but It was
in vain. The police vigilance resulted in
not a salocn opening its doors in dispens
ing liquor, which, no doubt, accounts for
the absence of excitement which pre
vailed. The policemen stood outside their
appointed polling booths with nothing to
do but loQk for the trouble that never
came.
At the noon hour things were even mor<?
quiet, though ~bver In the factory region
overalled voters took advantage of the
time to go and place their vote. Alto
gether this election day will go down In
the annals of the south side electors aa
"just like Sunday." _ -
Him in Disgrace Behind His
Ticket in Two Districts.
If an election was being held in the
Thirty-sixth. Thirty-seventh, Thirty
eighth or Fortieth districts nobody knew
of It unless he was privileged to enter one
of the polling places to cast hts vote.
There he found the election officers pa â¢
tlently waiting for the next vote to be
cast and to all questions regarding - the
situation the same answer would be pro
nounced:
"It's the quietest election we have ever
experienced. '
In the section west of Devisadero street
In the four districts named the voting
was heavy and most of the ballots were
cast before 1 P- m. In the Sixteenth Pre
cinct of the Thirty-seventh District 157
ballots had been cast out of a total of 213
registered at the same time. In the Twen-
IT was not until the election was over
yesterday that San Franciscans
pave evidence In excitement that
they had passed through a national.
Stale and local contest. Although
there were close and bitter legislative con
tests In several of the Assembly districts,
there was no outward evidence of the
fact. The police were ornaments; they
made fewer arrests than on a day of or
dinary life. The saloons in most cases
were closed and drunkenness was such
an exception as to be extremely notice
able. There was no attempt at Illegal
voting, as the new signature requirement.
demanding of Â«ivery voter that he sign his
name in the election booth upon a regis
ter, had a very salutary effect In what
follows is given, district by district, the
story of the city's model election.
MARTIN KELLY LETT
IN DISGUSTED LONELINESS
The South-Side Battalions of the Dol
lar Boss Desert His Discredited
Standards at the Foils.
A heavy vote was polled In the Twenty
eighth, Twenty-ninth. Thirtieth and Thir
ty-flrs,t districts. When the voting booths
opened at 6 o'clock citizens stood In line
ready to cast their ballots. Having done
their duty they proceeded to. their work.
Before noon half the number of voters
whose names were on the precinct regis
ter had cast their ballots. During the
afternoon the ttragglers entered the elec
tion booths and deposited their votes.
Not an Incident to amount to anything
happened in these Assembly districts. The
policeÂ»on duty at every voting place lolled
around. Their office for the time was a
sinecure. The day passed without a dis
pute or a fistic battle, according to the re
ports made by the officers. A feature of
the election was the absence of drunken
men. This was due to the absolute en
forcement of the law compelling saloons
to close during the hours of voting. A
number of saloon men, however, were
tempted to sell liquor to visitors to their
places, and several arrests were made by
Sergeants Mahoney and Wolff. The latter
visited the numerous drink places in the
district, and where they saw men 'partak
ing of refreshments they apprehended the
Chief of Police Sullivan, accompanied
by Captain Wittraan, visited every polling
place in the four districts mentioned and
were highly Â«rratined at the quiet which
prevailed. Sullivan kept a sharp lookout
for open saloons, but. he failed to discover
a single instance of any violation of tha
law. The report that the Police Com
missioners would revoke the license of
any saloon-keeper found open before 5
n. m. had a salutary effect on the proprie
tors and even the proverbial little '.'sfda
door" was closed, though it was said that
If onÂ« were pretty well known he would
be admitted to, quench ; a thirst 'which
needed the operation. Â«
Up to 5 o'clock not a single arrest had
been made at either the Park police sta
tion on Stanyan street or the N'orth End
station on O'Farrell street.- In none of
the precincts mentioned were any chal
lenges issued, and the officers In charge of
the various polling places were not called
upon at any time during the day to quell
the slightest disturbance.
In the Twenty-first Precinct of the
Thirty-seventh District there remained
but thirty votes to be cast out of 250 at
4 o'clock, and the Fourteenth Precinct of
the Thirty-eighth District showed that
forty citizens . had yet failed to use their
elective franchise.
In the Eighteenth Precinct of the Thirty
sixth Assembly District 315 votes were
polled out of 3S0 at 3 o'clock. In this pre
cinct a voter refused to mark his ballot.
He insisted on It being put Into the bal
lot-box In blank form and he was ac
commodated by the Judge of the election,
who ruled that a man was at liberty to
vote as he desired, though his particular
preferences would fail to be tallied. -.
In the Seventeenth Precinct of the For
tieth District 177 votes were polled out of
243 at 2 o'clock and the election officers
themselves said they did not know that
an election was going- on. Along Point
Lobos avenue at the same time the rec
ords showed 1S4 votes polled out of 261 In
the Eighteenth Precinct of the Fortieth
District: 210 out of 2S7 In the Nineteenth
Precinct of the Fortieth District, and 1S$
out of 2Â© In the Twentieth Precinct of the
Fortieth District.
tieth Precinct of the Thirty-seventh Dis
trict, where 350 voters live, 175 took the
precaution to vote before 2 o'clock in the
afternoon. In that precinct and In the
T-wenty-flrst Precinct it was evident from
"whisperings" that E. I. Wolfe, candidate
for State Senator, was running behind his
ticket. William E. White, the Democratic
candidate, seemed to be having it all his
own way. though the two precincts are
generally regarded as Republican. Frank
Kerrigan was putting up a great fight for
the short term for Superior Judge. The
Democrats were supporting him in large
numbers.
ABSOLUTE QUIET MAEKED
ELECTION IN THE CITY
in every precinct he ran behind his ticket
So pronounced was this castigatlon of in
diprant voters that when the polls closed
there was general hope that Wolfe had

has disgraced.

had scores of Republican champions and
at 5 o'clock the Dibble forces admitted
that if they had not been beaten the con
test was close enough to leave the issue
very doubtful. It was known that the
Southern Pacific Company had raised a
corruption fund in this district, but the
handlers of the money were shrewd
enough to be extremely chary In using It.
In the Forty-second Assembly District
the same strujgle of decency against cor
ruption was waged. Republicans united
with Democrats to defeat LÂ». A. Henry.
the Republican candidate, and by noon a
Republican district, which has a normal
majority of 600 votes, was made doubtful.
Republicans In this district as in others
were teaching their leaders the lesson that
reputable men must be nominated.
In the Fourth Congressional IMstrict the
Issue never was la doubt. In every As
sembly District Julius Kahn was leading
his opponent and the election of the Ke
publlcan candidate was conceded on ail
sides. In that part of the Fifth Congreo
sional District which Is In San Fran
cisco the same story may be told of
Eugene F. Loud, who was overwheimins
his opponent with votes. .
As ballots were cast early In the day
voters trooped down town In thousands
to read the latest news from the East.
At night Market street was a mass of
surging humanity and cheer after cheer
went forth as McKinlej-'s success waÂ»
taken from the realm of. doubt and be
came a splendid certainty.
At the hour of going to press this morn
ing enough votes had been counted in the
city to fndlcate. except in one or two ex
ceptionally' close contests, who had been
elected. In the following tabte is given
the vote as counted for Presidential elec
tors, Superior Judges. Justices of the
Peace. Congressmen. Senators, Assembly

cameras and gripsacks and fortified by
insatiable curiousity, are preparing to
come among us.

that it has about 1500 Americans coming
here in July. The Paris Exposition, the
Passion Play at Ober-Ammergau ana the
desire to escape the fever of the Presi
dential election are all sending Americans
here.
This is no sudden impulse. For nearly
two years plans have been maturing in
all parts of America for this. Smart men
in every Congressional district have set
themselves to forming tourist clubs. Hun

REVIVAL OF GALVESTON.
WHEN the campaign became so exciting as to
attract public attention away from Galveston
that stricken city was so overwhelmed by the
disaster that had befallen her it was doubtful whether
she would recover her business energies in time to
provide her people with work and wages during 'the
rapidly approaching winter. Now that the election i?
over and we can once more give attention to her needs
there will be more than ordinary gratification in
noting that all reports give promise of abundant work
in and around the city and good profits and wages in
all lines of business. *
A recent review of the situation by a special cor
respondent of the New York Journal of Commerce
says: "The wreckage is still abundant in the residence
section, but in the commercial part of the town the
ravages of wind and wave have been for the most part
repaired or concealed. The work of rebuilding has
made the business of dealers in hardware, lumber, paint
and glass much heavier than it was before. But in all
lines of business there has been a recovery that would
not have been supposed possible. The grain ele
vators and the wharves were found to be, less damage!
than was at first supposed. The receipt and shipment
of cotton were resumed a few days after the disaster,
and within a month business in all lines was proceed
ing much as usual."
The people of Galveston deserve the highest com
mendation for the courage and the energy they 'have
exhibited in grappling with the calamity that came
upon them. Praise should also be given to the bank
ers, manufacturers and merchants of other cities, who
in their dealings with Galveston business men have
granted them large credits upon all lines of goods. It
is stated that in the large commercial centers orders
from Galveston have been filled freely and promptly.
Thus the merchants .of the city have been able to
obtain and to supply whatever is needed in the work
of rebuilding. Out of the gloom of the great disas
ter, therefore, there come at least two things of which
the American people may be proud â the energy of the
survivors of the stricken city and the generosity of the
helpers in all parts of thc Union.
CANADIAN ELECTIONS.
/^Â» AXADA holds her general elections to-day. It
( has been a jingo campaign on the part of the
/ Laurier Ministry. ant^ thc Conservative oppo
sition has met the Government along the whole
line. In many constituencies there was no contest,
and consequently several Liberals and several Conser
\atives have already obtained seats by acclamation.
The number that has been thus fortunate, however, is
comparatively small, and the voting to-day will prob
ably be very close throughout the Dominion.
In the Canadian House of Commons when every
constituency is represented there are 213 members. Of
these Ontario elects 92, Quebec 65, Nova Scotia 20,
New Brunswick 14, Prince Edward Island 5, Mani
toba 7, British Columbia 6, Northwest Territory 4.
In the House which has just been dissolved thi
Laurier Ministry had as supporters 12 irom Nova
Scotia, 5 from New Brunswick, 3 from Prince Ed
ward Island, 50 from Quebec, 45 from Ontario, and
in addition 6 independents from that province who
supported the Ministry on all leading questions of
party policy; 5 from Manitoba, 4 from British Colum
bia and 3 from the Northwest Territory. On some
issues the Ministry had a majority as high as 52, but
generally it was not more than 45.
Following the usual tactics of party campaigning
each side claims that it will make heavy gains in this
election. The fight has not centered upon any par
ticular point, snd consequently the canvass has been
largely personal. Grave charges have been brought
against the Ministry, and it is asserted there have been
many scandals in connection with various departments
of the administration. These probably amount to no
more than thc customary campaign cries which are
heard whenever there is no "paramount issue" to dis
cuss before the people.
If any one question be more prominent than an
other in the canvass it is the famous "preferential
tariff" which the Laurier Ministry carried through
Parliament with thc avowed object of giving Great
Britain in Canadian markets an advantage over ths
United States or any other nation. The tariff ap
pears to have been a failure, and the Conservatives
claim that no preference should be given to British
goods in Canada unless Great Britain reciprocates by
giving Canadian products equal preferences in Brit
ish markets.
Summing up the results of the tariff The Mail and
Empire, a Conservative organ, recently said: "Thus
in the last four years the United States has sold to
Britain $446,853,726 more than it would have sold
had the average of its sales been just equal to the sales
in 1896. To Canada in the same period the United
States has sold $92,952,832 worth more of goods than
it would have sold had its average yearly sales been
just equal to the sales of 1806. That is, in the British
market it has gained $446,853,726 in the four years,
and in the Canadian market $92,952,832. In the mean
time Canada's sales to the United States in that time
have not averaged as high as the figures of 1896. and
fall short by $20,844,^24 of doing so."
There have been more or less evidences of jealousy
between the British and the French races during the
j campaign, but these have not been of a nature to se
riously affect the votir.g. If Laurier win. his victo-y
will be mainly due to the jingro spirit roused by, the
dispatch of Canadian troops to fight for the British
empire in South Africa, and consequently the move
ment toward "imperial federation" will be largely
affected by the result.

PRESIDENT McKINLEY'S personal popularity carried California. With the most
nerveless and least efficient State Committee an<i organization the Republican party
ever had here, and that is saying a good deal, the people jumped over everything
and were swift-footed under every handicap, to run jocund to their duty of sustaining
a President who has sustained them.
Perhaps in no State has there been emitted more calumny against the President
than here. His life, his motives, his public and private character have all been daily
assailed in the Examiner, Calumniator-in-Chief of the Bryanites.
Right gallantly have the people of California answered the traducer and stamped on
his slanders. And they did it of their free and good will, not by the orders or organiza
tion of a lax and discredited State Committee.
Well may national Republicanism pat California on her level head. When a patri
otic duty is to be done, she girds her and goes to it level eyed.
The President had to be sustained and Bryanism had to be rebuked, and she did
both and did both well. All honor to her Republican citizens for it and all honor, too, to
the patriotic Democrats who turned their backs upon the Populist Bryan and voted for
McKinley and their country against the world.
The Republicanism of this State is greatened and bettered by the result. The party
will not permit itself hereafter to be used as a dunghill to sprout political mushrooms,
but will take its own affairs in hand, send boastful corruption and incompetence to the
rear and invite its real worthies to the front. I
CALIFORNIA'S VOTE.
THE ALASKAN STABLE
? Sit was one of the labors of Hercules to cleanse
/ \ the Augean stable*; so it will be the duty of
1 * President McKinley and Congress to recon
struct and reform the official situation in Alaska. An
odor comes from the conduct of the court at Nome
which is worse than that ot canned beef.
The chief promoter and actor in this iniquity is one
Alexander McKenzie. who is now a prisoner in this
city in the custody of the United States Marshal and
a suppliant J'Â»r relief and clemency both before the
Supreme Court of tht United States and the United
States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Xinth Cir
cuit.
From accounts deemed authentic and trustworthy
which have lately been received directly from Nome
there seems to be no reasonable doubt that a state of
aliairs has this year existed in that territory which
would have Â«-j=ed the organization of a Vigilance
Committee iii this State during its early history. It
consisted, in brief, of a combination and conspiracy
of nearly every Federal official in the Nome distric:
except the clerk of the court, whose fairness and in
tegrity ?.re vouched for by all who have been inter
viewed, and including the Judpe. one Arthur H.
Koycs, his stenographer, the Court Commissioner,
the United States Attorney and his deputy, and others
of less importance.
It was .1 01 trust or combination of extraordin
ary proportions and novel in character.
A corporation was formed in Arizona called the
Alaska Gold Mining Company, with its office n
New York and its field of operations in Alaska. Its
guiding spirit and patron saint was Alexander Ml-
Kentie, a political bully and boss, and sometime resi
dent of Xonh Dakota.
From the S15.000.000 of the capita! stock of this
compar4 it is related that McKenzie distributed, or
acrecl to distribute, some $3,000,000 in amount.-.
ranging from $50,000 to S^oo.ooo each, to various per
soris who were to back and assist in the enterprise.
Some of these parties were to set up claims to mines
in Alaska, and if those in possession would not sur
render in whole or in part to begin suits and get
Judge Xoyes to appoint McKenzie or some substitute
a receiver to take and work the properties until 3
satisfactory settlement was made or a trial and judg
jr.ent by this same Jr.dgc. The proof seems conclu
sive that Judge Xoyes arrived at Nome on a Satur
day in last July and on the following Monday he ap
pointed McKenzie receiver of the most valuable mines
in that locality, ;;nd only required a nominal bond as
such receiver.
So indecent was the haste and so flagrant the abu-e
of the process of the court that in some cases receivers
â¢were appointed and took possession several days be
fore the complaints were filed. It is estimated thit
McKenzie had actually gotten hold of nearly half a
million in gold dust under this receiver process of
working before he ran up against the Federal courts
of th:s circuit.
The Federal officials at Nome were aiding and
abetting this ;vorse than robbery. Business in the
district was paralyzed, and but for the United States
troops violence and bloodshed must inevitably have
followed this abuse ard prostitution of the court.
We will not dwell en 'the details of this infamy, the
proof of which this paper will undertake to furnish
<.r. any proper occasion, but consider briefly how such
a c t:-:te of affairs was made possible.
Three United States Senators, Carter of Montana,
Davis of Minnesota and Hansbrough of North Da
l:ota. are mentioned as the political friends and back
er of McKenzie. the sponsors of nearly all these dis
honest officials in Alaska, whose appointments they
cither recommended or procured, and if the word of
one of the principal plaintiffs in whose suit McKen
Â¦Ac was appointed a leceiver is to be taken, these Sen
ators are also largely interested in this same Alaska
Gold Mining Company.
God help the Fiiioinos if the same class of officials
is to' he installed in those islands when a civil govern
ment is established.
It is whispered that McKenzie has thrown up his
Kinds to some of the parties who had the pluck and
courage to fight him and has agreed to surrender up
his plunder to them and procure the suits to be dis
rrnssed. We hope this will have no effect upon the
â¢â¢ourt in disposing of the contempt proceedings, be
cause it seems clear that he not only flagrantly dis
obeyed the writs of the courts but united with Judge
Xoyes and some of his attorneys in speaking of their
Judges with the greatest disrespect. Fortunately the
people have unbounded respect and confidence in all
the Federal courts on this coast south of Alaska. In
California. Nevada. Oregon. Washington and Idaho
the Federal Judges are pre-eminent for their- integ
rity and fitness, and the public generally will rejoice
to see this man McKenzie so dealt with, if his con
tempt be legally established, as to afford a warning
to others.
A telegram from Washington, represented to be
from Senator Davis, ha* been recently shown in this
city by one of the friends of McKenzie stating that
matters were all right at that end. This probably re
fers to an expected demand for an investigation by
Congress of the Alaska situation and the belief on
the part of McKenzie's friends that they have a suffi
cient political pull to prevent it.
It ;Â« to or hoped r.nd expected that Congress will
speedily give this matter the fullest investigation and
exposure.

IT WOULD have been a painful surprise to Americans and to the world if the Presiden
tial election had ended in other result than the re-election of President McKinley.
After all is said and sung, governments have to do with the material welfare of
the people. This is not saying that legislation can create values, or make something out
of nothing, as Mr. Bryan has always contended it can, but it means that Gov
ernment may leave the people free of artificial limitation to pursue their vocations, earn
their bread and make their profits, and it. may impose or remove obstacles to their
progress. The unexampled advance made by this country under President McKinley's
administration is due to removal of the handicap of free silver and the fear of Bryanism,
as well as to the sound policies of the Government.
With our commerce suddenly swollen to larger proportions than that of the com
bined world, and with a market and a demand for our surplus which make certain the
steady employment of American labor as far ahead as one can. see; with an increasing de
mand for everything that we produce and the flow hithenvard of the world's capital to
settle its balance of trade, making it necessary for other nations to come and borrow
back the money they have paid for our goods â with all these conditions the defeat of
President McKinley would have seemed to indicate the indifference of our .people to
their material welfare and would have encouraged our distanced commercial rivals to
hope that by our stumbling they may overtake us.
Happily all of these expectations are defeated. The American people stand by the
public credit and vote for private prosperity. They want liberty regulated by law, and
a full dinner pail, rather than rhapsody, anarchy and an empty belly. The pied piper of
the Platte has piped his last, and not a rat has run nor a child followed.
. The country may now 'go about its business in peace and security, and our com
merce may safely entrench itself on the fields it has conquered, for there will be no re~

THE RESULT.
FLORIDA TIMES-UNIONâ The com
mon opinion is that "the cost of living
constantly increases." But this is not
true because the food and clothes our
fathers bought have risen in price, but
because our standard of living has risen.
Seventy-flve dollars will buy more meat
and flour and cloth of the same quality
now than JWO would fifty years ago. but
we spend more on the table and our
backs, because we demand for each day
what were considered luxuries then or
"out of reach."
BOSTON JOURNALâ A few of the
twenty gunboats in the new naval pro
gramme may be employed in the Philip
pines, but the battleships, the armored
cruisers, the torpedo craft will be built
for service elsewhere. They cannot be
charged up to the Philippine account.
They are a general addition to that sea
power which must be developed until we
are the second nation in naval as we are
already in merchant tonnage in the world.
BALTIMORE AMERICANâ The com
mrrcial victories America has been win
ning in the tierce competition for the
world's markets have been of such fre
quency and magnitude that here at home
they have come to be accepted as a mat
ter of course. While the world stands in
amazement at our progress as a great
supply depot. American merchants and
manufacturers are going ahead with but
little ado about their movements, achiev
ing new triumphs almost daily.
BOSTON HERA LT>â Spain had a fleet
in the Phillpnines and the neighboring
seas constantly, and we must do the same.
In the event of war our outpostsâ the
Philippines. Hawaii. Porto Ricoâ would
invite attack, unless attack seemed hope
less. The fleet which It is proposed to
build would be unnecessary if we had not
expiinded. For home defense fortifica
tions have hitherto been the chief reli
ance; but now we have far away ports to
be defended.
RICHMOND TIMESâ If famÂ© be based
on pre-eminence in some great calling and
if achievements be recognized by the
whole world, Stonewall Jackson, the
American, is more famous than Gilbert
Stuart or Asa Gray. But th.en. fame is
not to be caught and shut up in any bulla
lng, not even in the temple built for it in
New York.
ST LOUIS GLOBE-DEMOCRATâ The
X'nlted States, in aggregate wealth, pass
ed the United Kingdom years ago, which
had led until that time, and this years
figures are likely to show that the per
capita wealth is now also greater here
than it is there. The exhibit, both in pop
ulation and business activities, of the
United States during the past- ten years
Is a story of expansion In which every
American can feel a thrill of pride.
CINCINNATI COMMERCIAL. TRIB
UNEâThere Is on all sides a noticeable
demand for college-educated men. We do
not believe that a college education can
do everything for a young man. but It Is
a great factor of intellectual development
and character culture for the great ma
jority of young people enabled to enjoy
its benefits. ,
ATLANTA CONSTITUTION â Other
men, following in the footsteps of An
drew Johnson, now claim credit for that
which he first fought. He will ba known
to the future as the President who. In
the hour of th<j nation's madness,
saved it from Itself, and thua became the
Defender, as the Immortal Webster was
the Expounder, of the constitution.
PHILADELPHIA TIMESâ The Jockey
has his uses, and If making John Bull sit
up is one of his faculties he has gained
new values to his countrymen.
NXW YORK TRXBTTNE â With rÂ»vctaÂ«r
stables owned and racecourses controlled
by men of independent means, of char
acter and taste, who love the sport sim
ply as a sport, and who seek the im
provement of the breed of the noblest of
quadrupeds, horse racing is a humane,
honorable and honest thing, worthy of
the regard of people of character and
culture. With the stables and courses
conducted by mercenary speculators who
care nothing for sport and nothing for
horses, but everything for the dollar*
they can make, and who conduct the
whole business as a business of rather
shady practices, horse racing is no longer
worthy of the name of a sport, and Is
uncommonly lucky if it deserves any
better name than that of gambling.
CHICAGO TRIBVXE-If the South In
not ready to sacrifice its race prejudices
and establish eome modus vlvendl with
the colored people It must expect that
they will leave whenever they can. If
the farmers lose their help, which la
equivalent to losing their crops, they will
have onlv themselves to blame. Race
friction does not pay in harvist time.
NEW YORK HERALD-The admin
istration at Washington admits the de
sirability and value of arbitration, but
thinks the way to It will hardly bÂ« clear
until It appear* that diplomacy cannot
reach an a^rreement. There Is somÂ« forcÂ«
in this. At the same time. It Is to ti
noted that the situation In Peking Is
critical, and may become perilous by pro
tracted delay.
BROOKLYN EAGLEâ It Is lnter*Â»tlnÂ»
to note "that of the total Increase. In pop
ulation In the past ten years nearly two
thirds of It has been duÂ« to the excess of
births over deaths and only a little more
than one-third ha* come from Immigra
tion. This healthy condition of the races
here Is encouraging to those who believe
that the day of the decline of the Teat
ness of America is long distant. If thÂ®
birtbs and deaths were about, ecraal, as
they are in France, one might well fear
for the future.
BOSTON TRANSCRIPTâ In countries
old In trade with other nations. Into which
Germany has pushed In auest of mar
kets, German merchants have found
America a quick competitor. A commer

PROVIDENCE. Nov. 6.â On an increased
vote Bryan has made considerable gains
In Rhode Island. McKinley's pluraJlty of
four year? ago was 22.97S. Only half of the
143 districts in the State have been heard
from, those missing including most of
those In the cities, with most of the fifty
r.lne in Providence. McKinley' s plurality
will be about 20,000. it Is believed. Provi
dence, which in 1*>'*> gave McKinley 8211
plurality while electing a Democratic
Mayor, "has elected Granger (D.) by a plu
mlity of less than 1000. In 1S96 every city

tee admits a reduced plurality.

o'clock to-night it is conceded that Mo-

Democrats do not deny that he may win.
but say If he does his majority will not
be over 1000. Republicans, on the other
hand, are claiming: all the way from 1000
to 5000 for him. Returns from outside

WHITE RIVER JUNCTION. Nov. 7.â
At 1:15 a. m. returns had been received

Thnfe will probcbly give additions to the

which have made returns at this hour
Bryan received 13.R91 and McKlniey 33.795.
This will give a Republican plurality eÂ«

Republicans have a net loss of about 11

Tt'e Cleveland was unloading her large
cargo of coal .Â¦when the storm came up on
Monday. Operations were at once stopped
and the steamer put to sea. The snow fell
thick and fas? and the wind howled a
hurricane when the vessel started for
Sledge Island.- No further details of how
the steamer struck upon the rocks will
be known until Captain Jounk. who com
manded her. reaches Nome. When Cap
tain ClIbbKard heard of the disaster he
sent a messenger out to the Government
transport Seward to request the captain
to steam up tho coast and render the
Cleveland any assistance possible. When
the Cleveland put to pea a huge lighter
containing 6*Â») packs of coal was towing
a?tern. The steamer made heavy weather
of the gale and the lighter was cut adrift.
The lighter was cut loose this side of
Sledgre Island, bo somewhere In that vl
clnlty is a carjro of coal that Is worth
more to the lucky finder at present than
a gold mine. Private parties set out in

Tom Chlng was Identified by the wit
nesses, but he denies that he fired the
shots. The wound inflicted upon Sing is
not dangerous. She was treated at the
Receiving Hospital.
Collins and Lord received a description
of the highbinder who did the shooting
from fivp witnesses, and. soon had the
shooter under arrest.
Last night Sine: ventured into Baker al
ley. She had gone but a few feet when
Tom stepped out of the shadow of a
building across the thoroughfare and rais
ing his revolver tired the two shots. Sing
felt a BtinEing sensation in the leg and
sank to th" srround. The other bullet
whizzed by close to her head.
Sing claims that Tom Is at the head of
a band of highbinders that has been try
ing to compel her to pay tribute for some
time. Recently she refused to comply
with their demands for money, and a
price was placed on her head. She was
warned of the danger that threatened her
and for the past few days has remained
Indoors.
The murderous attack was made on the
girl, the Chinese claim, because of her re
fusal to submit to a blackmailing scheme.
In which many Mongolians are implicated.
The would-be murderer was captured by
PoJIcemen J. B. Collins and F. Lord and
taken to the City Prison. i
Sing Kim, a Chinese girl, was shot, but
not fatally injured, -by Tom Chlng, a no
torious highbinder, in Baker alley shortly
after 11 o'clock last night. Two shots
were fired at Sing as she passed out of a
house, and one of. them took effect in her
leg.

ATLANTA. Nov. 6.â The General As
sembly in Joint session to-day elected
Hon. A. O. Bacon. United States Senator
to succeed himself.
Baron Re-elected Senator.
The Times this morning says: "The re
election of President McKinley In the face
cf a general condemnation of his policy Is
the fullest, justification of the battle the
Democracy has made in defense of popu
lar rightsâ a battle that begins anew to
day and will continue until it is won The
enormous concentration of capital under
corporate control has become the dom
inant power In this country. It controls
our Legislatures; it controls the National
Government; it controls our elections
Through Us countless channels of Influ
ence, by corruption, by intimidation and
misrepresentation of every kind. It has
compelled the election of its chosen candi
date against the deliberate Judgment of
the American people "
CHICAGO. Nov. 7.â Under the caption
"It Never Fails" the Inter Ocean says
editorially: "The American people at the
polls have returned a verdict of sturdy
common sense and unflinching patriotism
This was foreseen from the beginning by
every American with any understanding
of his countrymen's character. When
Imminent danger confronts the American
people they always rise and overcome it.
The Republican party entered the cam
ralgn with a firm reliance upon the cour
ape. honesty, common sense, respect for
law and devotion to the country of the
normal American citizen. It had faith
that thft sons would prove worthy of the
fathers. The American people put an end
to copperhead Ism. to ilat moneylsm and
to free silverlsm. They have delivered
themselves from Bryanlsm. a combination
of all political lunacies of the past.
BALTIMORE. Md., Nov. 7.â The Amer
ican says editorially this morning con
cerning the election: "Decencv and order.
national honor and integrity triumphed in
yesterday's election. The Kansas City
convention erred in imagining It could
dictate the relative Importance of the
questions at Issue, and the ttrst half of
Bryan's campaign was devoted to a
strenuous effort to vitalize the twin bug
bears of Imperialism and militarism,
manufactured by fabrication for the sole
purpose of enticing the votes of the un
thinking and credulous. The people's
pronunciamento is a rebuke to such
despicable methods and carries with It the
unqualified approval of the new foreign
policy, resultant upon the Spanish war.
With such indorsement as was given him
yesterday. President McKinley need have
no hesitancy in carrying his policy In re
lation to the Philippines Into vigorous
execution."
The Journal says: "We believe It to be
perfectly clear that If the country has're
jected Mr. Bryan it has done so with re
luctance; it ha? wanted Just such a Presi
dent as he would be. It has enjoyed the
prospect of exchanging a flabby nonentlty
for a chief magistrate who would domin
ate the sinister aggregations of capital in
stead of being dominated by them."
The Sun says: "By one of the most
emphatic votes ever polled this country
declared its intention yesterday to go on
as it has been going. It nolds fast to the
blessings of prosperity. It continues its
way along the path of progress. It again
repudiates the repudlators. It keeps the
nag aloft. No process of reasoning can
make of this magnificent victory anything
else than an Indorsement and approval of
the administration of President McKinley.
May his second term be as glorious, as
productive and as beneficent as has been
his first."
The World says: "Though the result of
the election verifies the judsrment and
vindiifttes the warning of the World, we
most deeply regret the wasted opportu
nity of the party and Its failure to utilize
in victory the aspirations and hopes of a
majority of the peopie whose views on
the really living: and paramount questions
it eo splendidlv espoused. We deplore the
fact that the country was not permitted
to vote directly and singly upon those
Issues."
NETS* YORK. Nov. 7.â The Herald says
editorially: "The country is to be con
gratulated on the vitally Important fact
that there Is to be henceforth no question
as to the stability of the standard on
which its mighty mercantile, Industrial
and commercial transactions are based,
and by which the wages of labor are ad
justed. After thirty years of disturbance
and doubt that fact is settled. Not less
hearty are our congratulations to the
preat Democratic party on the overthrow
of the faction which four and a half
years ago stole Its standards under which
to light for the purposes diametrically
opposed to the true Democratic princi
ples."

MILWAUKEE. Nov. 6.â Returns from
Wisconsin up to 10 o'clock, though com
paratively few, show on their face when
compared with the vote of four years ago
that McKinley has carried the State by a
lar^e plurality, equal to if not exceeding
the figures of 1K?(5, which were 102,612 Rob
ert M. Lafollette, the Republican candidate
for governor, is running about even with
the Presidential candiuate and is likewise
pure of carrying the State. While few re
turns have been received from the Con
gressional districts, these show the Re
publican candidates for Congress to be
running equal with the McKinley Electors
and the indications are that the Wiscon
sin o>lr nation will be solidly Republican.

TIES AT SAN BAPAEI*
GOLF TOUBNAMENT
Howitt, With a Handicap of
Four, Finish Even:
B. J. I>avis, Scratch, and Dr. EL *O.
SAN RAFAEL, -Nov. 6.â A large at
tendancq of fashionable people was pres
ent at the San Rafael golf links this after
noon to witness the final day's play In
the 'best hole handicap," which began on
Saturday.
The rules governing the contest were
somewhat unusual for this coast and
added Interest to the, close and exciting
game. Any number of circuits of the
links \ was allowed to each player, and
when he or she thought they had done
their very best the lowest scores made
for each hole were added together to
make the final score of the game.
The handicaps were given with such
excellent Judgment that In the men's con
test a tie wtween R. J. Davis, a scratch
man, and Dr. II. O. Howitt with 4 han
dicap was the final result. These two
gentlemen showed excellent form and the
driving of Mr. Davis, though a little wild,
was the feature of the day'% plav. Dr
Howitt played with perfect steadiness
and his coolness at critical moments
largely accounted for his excellent score.
A. A. Curtis. Major Charles Chrisensen
and S. G. Buckbee, the first two with 7
and Buckbee with 4 handicap, finished tie
forthe second place. They all made the
excellent scores of 44 and marked them
etlves as "dangerous"; for the comine
tournaments. i Â¦.,Â¦;

COIiUBES WITH STEAMER.
Struck by Bark.
Empress of Japan Damaged by Being
VICTORIA. B. C, Nov. 6.â The railing
ship Abbey Palmer, which capsized and
sunk In San Frandrco harbor some years
ago and which has been trading in the
Pacific under her new name since as an
American steel bark, was in collision with
the Empress of Japan, one of the three
Canadian Pacific "Railroad's lmers, off the
entrance to the straits early this morn
lnr.
The Empress, which sailed from here
last night for the Orient, returned to
night for repairs in consequence of the
Occident. Sho had her bridge and part of
her bulwarks damaged and several plates
bent on tho port side. The bark was said
to have had her bowsprit carried away
and her stem, broken, but whether injured
otherwise was not learned by those on the
Empress. She was seen to square away,
and taking advantage of the breeze pre
vailing sailed up for the entrance of the
straits.
The collision occurred in the darkness
of the early morning. The Empress was
bound out at a good pace when the bark
loomed up In the- darkness and with
scarcely time for a warning cry crashed
Into the steamer. The lookout man on
tho bark was thrown on to the Empress
and fell on the cover of one of the life
boats. He was uninjured and was brought
in by the liner. The Empress will have
to go into the drydock for repairs after
her cargo has been discharged.
The Abbey Palmer was bound Into the
Sound, light, from Honolulu.

A highly Interesting and valuable series
of lectures on "Greek Art" (Mycenaean)
Is now being given at Berkeley Univer
sity by Professor Louis Dyer of Oxford,
England.
The lecturer Is one. of the foremost au
thorities en Greek art and handles his
subject In lucid, direct and at the same
time exhaustive, fashion. The course is
divided into eight lectures, five of which â
"Introductory." "The Cretan Alphabet."
"Dr. Schllemann's Excavations." "Old
Gnossos" and "The Labyrinth of Minos*
â have already been given. The remain-
Ing subjects, which will be treated this
afternoon (Wednesday), to-morrow and
Friday afternoons at 4 o'clock are "Myce
naean Greek Art." "Mycenaean Lights on
Homer" arid "Mycenaeans In Egypt."
The annual autumn exhibition of the
Hopkins Institute of Art will open next
Wednesday evening, November 15, with a.
private view and reception to members.
Amedee Joullhi this week exhibits In one
of the local galleries a large Monterey
subject, with sandhills, blue sky and a
great broken pine for central Interest.
The sky lacks depth, shimmerâ it seems
to be high noon time o* dayâ but there is
strong, good color In the picture and the
gnarled and twisted tree-giant has an al
most human air of desolation.
Thaddeus Welch has a small Marin
County sketch in town this week, with a
charming out-of-door atmosphere about
It. In the same gallery a clever portrait
sketch of a girl In a well-managed pink
gown, by illss Blanche Letcher. Is
shown.
Almost every day sees some new Im
provement In the color printing process,
and the most subtle and delicate effects
are being reproduced, by one method or
another, with an extraordinary fidelity.
There Is an Interesting opportunlty
for comparison between some old
and new color printing In one of
the galleries this week, where some
of the old English Newhouse prints
(about 1845). with others of the same pe
riod, a Cecil Aldln, modern English and
some Henry Rivieres, modern French,
are to be seen. The older prints have
gained tone with the years, and certainly
lost much of their initial crudeness, but
the work of to-day In the same direction
Is vastly superior. The Aldin Is a charm-
Ing old English subject, "The Tollgate,"
and Is on the Caldecott order. The French
prints, by Riviere, are by no means so
good from an artistic standpoint, though
a view of Paris under the snow seen from
the fretted roof of Notre Dame â¢ has a
certain grotesque novel air that Is rather
attractive.

CASUALTY LIST
PARIS, Nov. 6.â The Senate reopened
its session this afternoon with M. Fal
lieres presiding-. After a very brief, and
uninteresting session adjournment until
Thursday was taken.
In the Chamber of Deputies there was
a lively scene previous to the formal
opening. On all Bides were groups of
Deputies discussing the probable pro
gramme of the Government concerning:
many Interpellations. The President of
the Chamber, M. Deschanel, presided.
The galleries were crowded.
After the preliminary business M. Wal
deck-Rosseau explained that the Govern
ment would not delay action on the vari
ous interpellations, but he warned the
Chamber that If the Deputies did not se
lect important Interpellations, dismissing
the others, the entire session would be
occupied with interpellations, to the det
riment of necessary important legisla
tion.
The Chamber then voted to proceed
with the Interpellation of M. Albert Va
zille. Radical Socialist, representing: the
MontagTis district of Lolret. on the gen
eral policy of the Government.
The Premier explained that the Govern
ment desired the discussion of a few re
form measures of immediate interest,
simultaneously with the budget discus
sion. These reforms, he explained, were
a law to reduce the 'tax on alcohol, old
age pensions, official arbitrators for labor
disputes and the reform of courts-mar
tial, and the law of associations, which,
he said, ought to be one of the first acts
of the Republican party, to avert tho
peril which menaced the public fortune
and moral unity of the country.
M. Rlbot, Republican, former Premier,
called attention to the differences in the
statements on social matters between M.
Millerand and M. Waldeck-Rousseau. In
eo doing, M. Ribot said he was surprised
that M. Mlllerand could continue in the
Cabinet in view of M. Waldeck-Rous
scau's declaration against Socialism.
M. Mlllerand replied warmly to M.
Rlbot. He declared he maintained his
opinions, but he explained, the members
of the Ministry had joined together on a
platform to which they could all adhere,
setting aside opinions of a secondary na
ture which might create discord. M. Mll
lerand added that they would find, when
the Government's bill to arbitrate strike*
was fully explained, that its provisions
wera such as to win the support of the
entire Republican majority. Tho Cham
ber adjourned until Thursday. , :

Inlet.
Social Dispatch to The Call
TACOMA, Nov. 6.â "Mrs. Fred Smith,
who arrived last night from Cooks Inlet,
Alaska, says that fully 400 out of the 1000
or more Indians inhabiting: that section
are now dying of cold and starvation.
Mrs. Smith's word3 are entitled to more
than usual credence, from the fact thai
ehe has received a gold medal from Con
gress for swimming into the surf and res
cuing three drowning seamen from the
British bark Ferndale off the coast of
Grays Harbor in January. 1S92. She was
then Mrs. Jlartha White. In the follow
ing year she and her husband went to
Cooks Inlet. She was the first white
woman In that country and to them was
born tho first whit* child there. Later
Mr. White died and two years ago she
married Fred Smith, the owner of rich
placer claims on Lynch Creek. Alter
spending the winter with her daughter in
California, Mrs. Smith will return -to
Cooks Inlet.
"I wish I could tell you all I know re
garding the terrible condition of tho
Cooks Inlet Indians," ehe said to-day.
"There are several tribes in that district,
.numbering over 1000 persons. Of this
number there are more than 400, Includ
ing young children and old women, who
are starving and freezing to death for
want of food and clothing. In former
years they have made, a living by hunt
ing. Since the advent of the white man
their condition has-been growing worse.
The miners with their campflres have set
the forests aflame. The young fox and
other fur animals that are reared in the
hollow roots of trees have been destroyed
until to-day In that section there is pra*c
tically nothing 1 at all. These natives
have, therefore, no furs from which
to make their clothing. They have
no furs with which to do any
trading or to buy food, and their
condition as I describe It is the result.
It is true that in the summer time they
put up a considerable quantity of fish,
l'Ut as many were not provided there Is
not enough to go around.
"All of these tribes are under the Rus
sian church, but this body has done lit
tle or nothing to help them- If the char
itable societies on the coast would take
tiie matter up some of the- suffering
might be alleviated. What they want
most is clothing and flour. -If theso
things cÂ«uld be got to them they could
survive during the winter. The country
that was once theirs is now ours and there
Is no reason why we should allow the
present condition to exist in a land that
belongs to the United States. I have
given them a share or what I have, and
when I left I realized that many of them
would be dead before my return. I was
powerless to prevent it. The Cooks In
let Indians are In worse condition than
the other Alaskan tribes, and If some
thing is not done it will only be a short
time until they become extinct."

Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU. Oct. 30.â The Imprison
ment of W. H. Marshall, former editor of
the Volcano, now suspended, upon the
charge of libel, has directed attention to
the imperfections in the penal system ot
the islands. When Marshall was first In
carcerated j he was paraded with the
chain gang and was treated like a, felon.
The indignities heaped upon him created
a good deal of comment, and Jailer Hen
ry explained that, according to the law,
no other course was permitted toward
the prisoner. The matter has been taken
up by the Attorney. General at the in
stance of Governor Dole. In the mean
time Marshall is receiving better treat
ment and is not compelled to wear the
same garb nor work with the chain gang.
In the future the same distinction will bo
made between felons and petty offenders.
A long standing feud in the Honolulu
Police Department, growing out of. differ
ences between Senior Captain Parker, a
native, and Officer Hanrahan, a white
man who had been rapidly promoted,
was ended last Sunday by the resigna
tion of the white man. after a last row
with Parker. High Sheriff Brown held
that both men could not remain on the
force and Hanrahan had" to go. There 13
a large proportion of natives in the rank
and file of the* Honolulu force and a gen
eral strike of policemen was threatened
when it was thought that tho head of tho
department might sustain Hanrahan
against the native captain. Hanrahan
came here about a year ago. He Is an
ex-policeman of New York and was for
merly in the army.

Samuel Johannavitz, a baker, and Pol
ish interpreter in tho. Police Court, was
instantly killed early this morning by
being electrocuted at his place of busi
ness, i He was uslrig a movable . incan
descent light when the current passed
through a place where the insulation had
worn off, and he dropped dead .on the
spot. One of the Hawaiian Electric Com
pany's wires is said to have been ground
ed or crossed with a line from the Gov
ernment power house, and this made a
current of about a thousand volts at the
time when the deceased took his lamp
in hand. Two other men in different
parts of the city were badly shocked, and
the police telephoned to the Government
station and had the power shut off.
A good deal of excitement was caused
by the unusual conditions, and the en
gineer in charge at the Hawaiian Elec

Deputy Sheriff Chillingworth of Hono
lulu Is the hero of an encounter with a
desperate prisoner, in which the officer
showed splendid nerve and succeeded In
taking a man Â¦who had him covered at
close quarters with a loaded revolver.
The prisoner was Charles Heffernan, who
was accused of passing a forged check.
While driving with Chillingworth to the
lail he succeeded in getting permission to
leave the hack on a plea of sickness.
Then he stood by the vehicle and pointed
a revolver at the officer, demanding that
the latter surrender the hack to him. The
officer kept his seat and told the man to
pro ahead and shoot. After a parley
Heffernan declared hl3 Intention to fire,
saylne: he didn't like to do so. He held
out his left hand to shake hands and say
good-by to the man he was Kolnp to kili,
still presenting the pistol. Chllllngworth
took the proffered hand and jerked the
man into the hack, seized the hand that
held the revolver and overpowered his
man. Heffernan had been arrested before
and had managed to escape. He is now
committed for trial on a 'charge of as
sault with a deadly weapon, in addition
to the old charge. The deputy sheriff is

BT ALBERT S. BOLLES, LL. D
Corporations have the same duty as in
dividuals in selecting proper employes for
the service required of them, safe places
wherein to work and proper appliances.
The fact that this duty must be done by
an agentâ a president, manager, superin
tendent or other officialâ In no wise
changes the duty or liability of the cor
poration itself. The rule has been well
stated by Mr. Justice Gray of- the Su
preme Court of Massachusetts. "A cor
poration must, and a master who has an
extensive business often does, perform
this duty through officers or superintend
ents; but the duty Is his and not merely
theirs, and for negligence of his duty in
this respect he is responsible. To hold
otherwiss would be to exempt a master
who selected all his machinery and ser
vants through agents or superintendents
from all liability whatever to their fel>
low servants, although he had been gross
ly negligent In the selection or keeping of
proper persons and means for conducting
his business. In the case of a corpora
tion tha president and directors, at least,
cannot be deemed mere servants, but
must bÂ© considered aa representing the
corporation itself."
Competency of Employes Is a Ques-
tlon of Fact.
Whether an employe is competent or
not is a question of fact. Â« Only in cases,
therefore, when an injury has happened
to a servant through the act of another
can the question* be answered whether the
injured servant or the one who injured
him was competent. Thus in one of the
cases a servant on a street railway, who
was injured by the negligence of the
motorman, tried toishow that the com
pany had not exercised ordinary care in
selecting him. Evidence was taken con
cerning his fitness and the court de
clared that the. company had not been
remiss in its duty.
A Corporation Cannot Shift Its Re-
sponsibility.
Though this duty of selecting fit em
ployes may be delegated or done by an
other for the employer, he cannot shift
or escape his responsibility. If he could,
the rule would soon cease to be of any
worth. The agent, therefore, who thus
acts for a corporation In selecting em
ployes is not regarded as a fellow servant
of the employes. In one sense all are
agents, acting for a common master; in
another sense they do not thus act.
The hiring agent, so to speak. Is not re
lated to those who hired him as one of
their own number, though in truth he is
hired and paid, it may be, in -the same
manner as the others. Thus In Ford vs.
Railroad, the Supreme Court of Massa
chusetts has remarked that "the agents
who are charged with the duty of supply
ing safe machinery are not. In a truÂ«s
sense of the rule, to be regarded as fel
low servants of those 'who are engaged In
operating it. They are charged with a
master's duty to his servant. They are
employed in distinct and separate depart
ments of service, and there Is no diffi
culty in distinguishing them, even when
the same person renders service by turns
In each, as. the convenience of the em
ployer may require."
Consequently when a servant is em
ployed by a corporation who proves to be
unfit for the use made of him and injures
another the corporation cannot escape
liability by saying that the act of hiring
was not its own, but that of another. A
corporation must, indeed, act through an
other, but In the hiring of servants, 1 fur
nishing them with appliances, safe places
for work. etc., s the corporation is regard
ed in law as acting directly, and therefore
Is responsible for the results. Such Is the
rule stated at an early day and has been
often applied.
Its Responsibility for Repairs.
The rule had been In existence only a
few years before the courts began to pare
It down. While still clinging to the first
part and holding corporations for the se
lection o.f fit employes, etc., they declared
that they could relieve themselves from
responsibility for keea'ng appliances in re
pair by appointing competent persons to
do this for them. Massachusetts led off
In this departure. In the case of Johnson
vs. Boston .Towboat Company the court
said: "One^cmployed In the care, super
vision and keeping in ordinary repair of
the means and appliances used In a busi
ness is engaged in a common service. Thus
a person charged with the duty of keep
ing the track of a railway In repair; the
chief engineer on a steam vessel, whose
duty It was to see that the machinery
was kept in order; an 'underlooker' In a
mine, whose duty it was to examine the
rock of the mine and prop it when dan
gerous; the general foreman and manager
of extensive builders and contractors'."
Again, in the case of King vs. Boston
and Worcester Railroad, Justice Fletcher
said: "If a corporation itself should be
held responsible to its servants that the
road, when first used, was safe and suf
ficient, yet keeping the. road In proper re
pair afterward would seem to be the work
of servants and laborers as much as any
other part of the business of the corpora
tion." In harmony with this rule the per
sons in charfee of a -train upon a railroad
were held to bo fellow servants with a
laborer employed in repairing the roadbed.
Although this point is of great practical
Importance* the reasoning of the court is
not always clear; and expressions are
added from time to time which leave the
reader in doubt concerning what the rule
Is. Tbus in the towboat case just men
tioned \the court remarked In Its opinion
that tne company was under an obliga
tion to its servants to use reasonable dili
gence to maintain in a suitable' condition
the appliances furnished for their use:
"If the company exercised that diligence
and provided suitable means for keeping
its apparatus in proper condition and em
ployed pmper servants to see that the
means were properly used. It had fulfilled
its duty." The duty to provide suitable
appliances, however. Is a personal one,
and liability for any neglect in perform
ing it as we have seen, cannot be evaded:
and .one might think from reading the
above, language that the- same duty ap
plied to the maintaining, repairing and re
newal of appliances, when, In truth. In
that State it does not.
The Courts Differ on This Question.
Maine
At this point, then, there is a parting of
ways among the courts, some holding,
like that of Massachusetts, that the duty
to repair may be fulfilled by appointing
competent servants and proper appliances,
material, etc., for this purpose: Â«ther
courts that this duty cannot be turned
over to another and liability therefor be
evaded any more than for furnishing suit
able appliances, etc., Jn the first Instance.
Opinion of the Supreme Court oÂ£
The opposite view has been expressed
by ,the Supreme Court of Maine. Says
Mr. Justice Danforth: "The same care
requisite in hiring a servant in the first
Instance must still be exercised in continu
ing him In the service; otherwise the em
ployer will become responsible for hi<Â»
want of care and skill. The employer will
be equally liable for the acts of an incom
petent or careless servant whom he con
tinues In his employment after a knowl
edge of such lncompetency or carelessness
or when in the exercise of due care he
should have known it* as if he had been
wanting the fame care in hiring." The
court then adds that the same thin? may
be said of machinery. A -servant has no
more control of the repairs than of the
machine, no more responsibility for one
than for the other. He uses it and in so
doing assumes the risk whatever it may
be. This is "implied in his contract of hir
ing. On the other hand his employer pro
vides the means of carrying on the busi
ness and as a matter of course assumes
the responsibility that his work shall be
done with due care, and as the responsi
bility continues so long as the means are
used, so must the same care be exercised
In keeping the required means In the same
safe condition us at first.
Such in effect is the reasoning of the
Supreme Court of Maine, and very likely

HOME STTJDY CHICLE QUERIES.
Michigan.
In a more recent case in Michigan thn
Supreme Court remarked: "The rule may
now bo considered as settled In this State.
as well as In must of the States, not only
that a master Is bound to use reasonable
care in providing safe tools and appliances
for the use of workmen in his employ, but
that this Is a duty which cannot be dele
gated to another, so as to relieve him*
rrom personal responsibility. â¢ â¢ â¢ The
rule adopted by the Federal courts and ir.
most of the States and which seems to u=Â»
most In consonance with reason ana nu
manlty. Is that those employed by the
master to provide or to keep in repair the
P'ace or to supply the machinery and
tools for labor, are engaged in a different
employment from those who are to use
tne place or appliances, when provided,
and they are not therefor* aa to each
other fellow servants." As they are not.
of course the employer is liable in all
cases of negligence In making repairs.
it w-m be seen, therefore, that the part
ing of the ways by the courts, the setting
up of two rules, is made to turn on thp
question, whether those who are engaged
in repairs are ascents of the employer or
co-servants or fellow-servants with tha
others. If they are agents then the mas
ter is liable: If they are fellow-servant?
then the rules applying to fellow service
apply to him and he escapes. It may be
added that In the larger number nf cases
and States they are held to be agents an.i
not fellnw-servants and the master Is held
liable for whar they do.
The case of. Davis v?. Central Vermont
Railroad Company la one of more than or
dinary interest. A flyman was killed by
the washing out of a culvert. It ni in an
improper condition and thin resulted from
the neslisence of the bridge builder and
madmaster. The company contended that
the bridge builder, rnadmnster and section
boss were fellow servants of the fireman
and that their negligence could not be im
puted to the road. In answering this de
fense the court asserted that if the master
personally attempted to do that part of the
work which he could not delegate to an
other and was negligent in- doing It and
Injured its employes the company was
liable therefor. "The question Is naturally
suggested why should he not also be liable
for the neglipence of the nsrent or servant
whom he has appointed to discharge the
samÂ« duty in hi* stead although he ha*
exercised due care to sejeet a person com
petent and skillful. Is such an agent or
servant while performing the. duty ca*t
by tho relation upon the master a fellow
Â¦workman with the master's servant in
the employment In such a sense that thÂ«
latter cannot and ought not to recover
of the roaster for the Injuries sustained
through the negligence of tho former? If
so the master who performs his part of
the duty as all corporations must, by
agents and sen-ants, secures an immunity
from liability which the master who per
sonally enters the service to manage and
direct the performance of the work docs
not enjoy." The court held that the com
pany -could not thus shield itself behini
others. The bridge builder and roadmaster
were the agents of the company and not
fellow servants with the fireman, and con
sequently their conduct was that of tha
company and it was responsible there
for. The opinion Is one of the best Judicial
utterances on this subject that we hav
seen and has been often cited in later

time Bume nne specimens were placed on

Alaska Gold Mining stock was to be the
great thing as soon as It could be placed
upon the market.
It was a case of playing both ends
against the middle. The miners were to be
despoiled in the gold lields and the brokers
were to be fooled on the street, while in
the meantime the stockholders were
growing rich upon the profits.
In the cases of the Wild Goose Company
Â«Lnd the Pioneer Company it is not thougnt
that there has been mucb gold lost, but ln
other cases something has happened to
the mines. In the Topkuk district there
was a mine known as the Black Eagle,
which was famous as the richest mine
ln the district. It had been worked only
enough to show its prospects, and then
while the owners were waiting for better
machinery to develop the mine to its full
est value, the inevitable receiver -stepped
in. For more than a month the receiver
worked the claim and in that time he re
ported two clean-ups. Under ordinary cir
cumstances miners on good claims Jn
Nome clean up every two or three days
at the most. And then when the report
for the month or more was finally turned
in It was shown that the Black Eagle had
yielded but $1000 over the labor expenses,
and the receiver and the machinery had
yet to be paid for. And the Black Kagle
mine had been thought to be a property
of tremendous value. The receiver at that
time was llrst a man named Cameron
but later, atter it was found that his ad
ministration was not so satisfactory to
the court as It might have been, he was
removed and McCormick. the vice presi
dent of the Alaska Gold Mining Company
was put -In his place. The attorney for

WOMAN OFFERS
TO ASSUME WORK
OF POLICEMEN
Annoys Children.
Mrs. Gregerson Says She
- Will Capture Man Who
"This thing is becoming too frequent."
said the lady: "it will have to stop. I In
tend to watch for the man myself, and I
intend to catch him. I have several times
escorted my little girl to school and each
time I armed myself with a police whis
tle. Â¦ I just wished he had crossed my
path then and I would have put an end
to the annoyance." â¢
The police took a report of the matter
and will endeavor to spare Mrs. Gregerson
the trouble of doing police duty.
For some time past a man who Is de
scribed as tall, dark complected, and well
dressed has been in the habit of waiting
on street corners in the neighborhood of
primary schools and frightening little
girls. On many occasions parents have
reported to the police that their children
have rushed home with their young lives
nearly scared out of them and told of
thrilling escapes from the lone stranger.
Some of the children have met the man
on their way to school, and the principals
of several institutions of learning have
also made complaint.
The police officers have spent some time
in an attempt to locate the much wanted
man. Two weeks ago an arrest was made,
but the children who were summoned to
the police station for the purpose of iden
tifying the prisoner said the party under
arrest was not the man. Mrs. Gregerson
said that her little girl had been followed
by the man near the corner of California
and Jones streets. \
Mrs. K. Gregerson, who resides near the
corner of Washington and Hyde streets,
amazed the officers at the North End po
lice station yesterday by announcing 1 her
Intention to capture a man who has for
some time annoyed the school children in
the neighborhood of California and Jones
streets. She stated that on previous occa
sions she had lain in wait for the objec
tionable party, and if he was not landed
behind prison bars soon she would assume
the responsibility of placing him there
herself.
CHOKED INTO
INSENSIBILITY
BY A MANIAC
Lilly Edwards Attacked and
Leit Unconscious by
a Strangler.
A short time afterward a lodger heard
the Kd wards woman groaning, and going
to her room found her in an unconscious
condition. Her throat was bruised and
bleeding, showing that the strangler
meant to kill her. Had it not been for
the landlady of the house Miss Edwards
is satisfied that she would have been
killed. She describes her assailant as be
ing about 40 years of age, well dressed
and wearing- a full beard. She is positive
that she would be able to identify him
in case he is arrested. Several police offi
cers have been on the lookout for the
man since, but have been unable to get
a trace of him. They claim that his mo
tive was not robbery, as there was a
purse on . the bureau containing several
dollars, which he did not take.
Baffled ln his attempt to strangle the
landlady the man hurriedly left the house
and ran down Bush street.
Lilly Edwards, a woman of the half
world, is congratulating herself that she
i3 not occupying a slab in the Morgue.
Several nights ago a well-dressed man
entered her room In a lodging-house on
Bush street, near Grant avenue, and after
introducing himself- as a relative of the
(. zar of Russia grabbed her by the throat
and proceeded to strangle her. Realizing
that she was in the hands of a maniac
the woman tried vainly to force him to
release his hold, on her throat. She man
aged, however, to shout once for help.
Her scream brought the landlady, and on
going to the room from which the cries
emanated she saw the strangler standing
over his victim, his lingers tightly clutch
ing her throat. Taking a police whistle
from her pocket the thoroughly fright
ened woman proceeded to blow it, when
the murderous stranger released his hold
on his victim's throat and started to at
tack the landlady. After knocking: the
whistle from her mouth he tried to grab
her by the throat, when she struck him
with her open hand and quickly ran into
her room. .

Terrence Hughes, the keeper of a small

his wife with a pair of shears last night
stabbing her In the abdomen and cutting
her on both hands and wrists. The w;fc
was removed to the Receiving Hospital
and Hughes was charged at the City
Prison with assault with a deadly weaooii
by Police Officer Koegel.
Hughes, in order that his wife might
not escape from him, locked the door of a
small room and proceeded to beat her.
He then picked up the shears and struck
at her several times, one blade penetrat
ing the left side of her abdomen, inflicting
a painful wound. Neighbors, attracted Dy
the noise of the scuffle, summoned the
police officer. "When Hughes saw him
coming he grabbed a number of teacups
but Koegel forced the door and placed
Hughes under arrest before he had time
to use them.
The stabbing was the culmination of a
number of family jars.

Thomas Phelan of 312 Collingwood street
was treated at the Receiving Hospital last
evening by. Dr. Bunnell for a number of
lacerated wounds of the scalp. Phelan.
was standing near the corner of Third

of a south-bound electric car. He was
knocked down and rolled along the track
for a short distance. He was taken into
a hallway and he claims that while he
was 4ying there in a semiconscious con
dition some one relieved him of $3 50.
After treatment at the hospital Phelan
was removed to his home.
QXTEEN IN FROM HONOLULU.
Brings Many Passengers but Little
It Came Sailing Out of a Thunder Cloud and Struck the Water
Nine Feet From the. Starboard Bow. ; ..
V m y HE American ship Kenllworth
I sails for Europe to-day and Cap-
I tain Taylor goes out mad, clear
JL through. As a master mariner
he had every right to cast h!s
vote, but the Registrar refused to allow
him to use the ballot because the ship ar
rived here on September 26 and Captain
Taylor could have registered from his
home on Taylor street. This meant a
vote lost to the administration.
The Kenllworth had a hard time of
it corning: around the Horn and for fear
of a similar experience Captain Taylor is
leaving his wife and family ln San Fran
cisco. Hitherto the big four-masted bark
has been a family boat and a governess
always formed part of the crew. On this
occasion, however, Master W. C. Taylor,
the captain'6 son, wants to take a course
at the Lick School and Mrs. Taylor wants
to stay back because her mother la now
past the "three-score-and-ten limit and
may r&su away any day.
On her last voyage the Kenllworth came
near being wrecked by a meteor. It was
at 9 a. m. and off the Horn. The Bhip
was under upper topsails and all hands
were on deck. Suddenly a meteor came
out of a thunder cloud and for a moment
it was thought the Kenilworth would be
struck. "It came exactly ln our direc
tion," said Captain Taylor yesterday,
"and for a few moments I thought we
would be struck. I couid hear the whizz
of the lump ct molten matter as it came
through the air and I guess the bulk of
my men were on their knees when it ;
.struck the water. To tell you the truth,
I was a little bit shaky about the knees
myself. That . meteor struck the water
about nine feet oft* the starboard bow and
as the water .sizzled up a big dgh came
up from my lungs. It was the narrowest
escape I have ever had in twenty-five
years of sea life."
Captain Taylor stands ace high with the
Sewalls and expects to make the run of
the season to Cork. The Kenilworth is a
clipper.

Water Front Notes.
The betting along the front is that the
Cleveland is not a total loss. A press
dispatch from Port Townsend says that
the vessel went ashore in a pale and be
came a total wreck. Shipping men say
it is impossible to wreck the Cleveland
and that she will come into port ucain.
In any event, the underwriters will bet 1
to 2 that the old-timer will once more
come into port.
The Manauense came Into port yester
day from Oyster Harbor. She will dis
charge and then 'outfit for her initial
cruise to Mexican ports.

troi the rich claims of the Nome
district, not only the Judge lnm
tett but his et-cretary, the United
Jjtatos Marshal and the Commissioners ;
are Implicated. It is charged that Arcme
liccitrr, secretary of Hie Judge, lias been

ileuben H. Stevens, the commissioner, j

because of the peculiar methods of his
<.itice. Under ordinary circumstances if a
j-ajfCr is offered to be recorded the holder \
is told that press of business will <Selay !
i!:<Â» work for weeks and possibly for I
months. But if an extra fte be orfered !
tlie paper will be recorded inside of !
twenty minutes.
AH these officials and others are in- !
eluded in a ni;g that is believed to be j
looting the northern gold fields. That j
there is a conspiracy no one in tne north
doubts, and that the conspiracy has been ;
nipped in the bud by the action of i
son:e of the claim holders who |
showed nght Is believed by all. It is |
charged against the Golden Sands Mining
Company and the AlasKa CJold Mining i
Company that they are corporations
Conned lor the purpose of filching from I
the miners what they have been noiding i
lor themselves; that they are corpora- !
Uor.s lormed for the purpose of buying i
up jumpers" titles, ana that when there i
was no jumper's title to a rich claim that
they wanted they sent some emis- '
6a.ry. sometimes a stockholder, on to the !
land and had him jump and bring suit
ii,i possession against the original owner. 'Â¦
A scheme so gigantic has seldom been !
floated and it is doubtful if it could be
evon started anywhere but above the
arctic circle.
On the gold fields the mere living of a
EMU costs well into the hundreds every
month. This he expects to set from his :
claim. Litigation costs well into the thoa- !
fands before a man's case comes into '
cciirt even to be set, and this, too. the
litigant must get from his claim. Law- 'Â¦
Urs' fees are high and the process of the ;
IÂ«.w is slow, and un<3er the tactics of the i
Alaska Gold Alining Company and the ' ;
DiMrict Court a man's claim is tied up !
for months, and if he holds out, for i
years. whi!Â«s a receiver works it in the
meanwhile and turns the g-oldÂ«over to the :
custody of the court. Miners. in Nome'
have no income t-ave what they dig from
the ground. They must pay and pay to
oppose the suits brought apainst them
ond soon it comes to pats that while their j
claims are yielding golden hordes that
they cannot touch they must let their liti- '
cation go for the want of the dust thev '
may not roach. Tbejr may compromise i
but unless they do they must give up or j

She Was Mother of Starter Caldwell
of Oakland Track and Re
cently Arrived From
the East.
Mrs.- Adelaide Churchill, mother-in-law
of James F. Caldwell. the starter for the
Oakland racetrack, was the victim of a
fatal accident yesterday morning at her
residence, 2024 Sutter street. She was
asphyxiated by illuminating gas.
Mrs. Churchill came to this city a short
time ago from Saratoga. X. Y., wfth her
daughter and son-in-law. It . was her
habit to arise at about 6 o'clock in the
morning. She did not appear at the
breakfast table yesterday at the usual
hour, but that fact did not excite any ap
prehension, it being assumed that she had
overslept. At 9:30 o'clock Mrs. Caldwell
went to the room and found her mother
lying dead on the floor. Mrs. Churchill
was in her night dress and matches lay
on the floor near her hand. The key of
the gas burner was turned partly on, and
the room was full of the poisonous fluid.
It is believed that Mrs. Churchill arose
as usual and started to light the gas, and
that after she had turne"d the key and
before she could apply a match she was
seized with a fainting: spell and was as
phyxiated.
â¢ Mrs. Churchill was a widow, 73 years
old, and a native of New York.

KENILWORTH HAS NARROW
ESCAPE FROM FIERY BOLT
The ladles of the California Club held
yesterday afternoon a session of exception
al Interest and Importance. The club de
cided by a unanimous vote to begin an
educational campaign for the preservation
of the forests of California. Trie report of
a committee appointed to, discuss the sub
ject and suggest methods of proceeding
submitted a report in which the necessity
of preserving the forest lands of the
State was eloquently presented. The re
ports was unusually elaborate and pointed
out the warnings of other States and na
tions which have neglected a duty of such
paramount importance to human life.
By invitation John P. Irlsn addressed
the club and offered a series of important
suggestions. He declared that it is of
vital moment to the well being of Cali
fornia that immediate steps be taken to
protect, preserve and perpetuate our for
ests. The material prosperity of the peo
ple is absolutely dependent upon, such a
course, as physical consequences of the
most serious nature will follow the denud
ing of the forests. It is appalling, he said,
that more timber is lost every year by
forest fires in California than is neces
sary for five years of economic use.
The national Government should be
urged to take measures adequate for the
protection of the forests. The State gov
ernment should be asked to provide money
for guarding against fires. Legislation
should be enacted to govern lumbermen
and their treatment of forests. Our two
universities should be encouraged to es
tablish schools of forestry and to develop
educated foresters. The need of all this
is imperative, and the speaker congratu
lated the members of the club upon their
activity and intelligent interest in a cause
which Â«Â«? essentially one' of the most vital
importance to American life.

has adopted a resolution to the effect ihat
it will meet a $15,000 deficit In the High
School fund when that deficit nhall occur.
The Board of Education has Incurred a
prospective deficit larger than this amount
by $61,000 because It Insisted upon estab
lishing two High Schools In th;Â« city. In
opposing the adoption of this resolution
Councilman Frank K. Mott said: ? -
"It Is well understood how and why this
deficit will occur. The Council disap
proved of the manner In which this .lo
flciency was created by the Bourd of Edu
cation, yet the adoption of tho reeolu r lon
virtually Indorses the action of the board
Its adoption practically establishes a pre
cedent by which the Board of Education
may Incur any expense It pleases with the
knowledge that the Council approves It.
"I am In receipt of additional statistics
from High Schools In other cities which
prove that the cost of the Oakland High
Schools Is excessive. In some Instances It
.Is almost double that of other clt^s I can
'name. Cities on this coast, too, that have
a population as great. If not greater, than
Oakland. I believe the Council should first
pass a resolution censuring the Board of
Education, then If a deficit arises meet It
as the necessity la apparent." <Â¦
Councilman Edwin Meese declared the
adoption of thtÂ» resolution would bÂ« farci
cal, as the presmt City Council would be
out of office before the deficit will have
been created.
"For this Council to pass a res-ttitlon

In Fpite of the denials frequent and

truth is that the- genial twlrler was
wedded- last Friday at Stockton to Miss
Catherine Barsfleld, daughter of Dr. J. P.
Sarsfleld of this ;clty. and a fellow
student with"' the* amiable "doctor" at a
medical college In San Francisco. The
wedding was celebrated at Stockton, Jus
tice of the Peace Parker officiating.
Whether the affair was an elopement
everybody interested declines to admit,
but there was enough secrecy maintained
to lend color to the : story, and Moskl
man's busy denials have added to the sus
picion. In the face of these denials the
affair gained much more notoriety among
his friends than: It would have had the
young medical student not attempted to
conceal the facts/
The original report was that Moskiman
[had married a Miss Catherine M. Cura
mings of St. Helena. In a search for the
actual conditions the identity of the real
bride was .disclosed.
The young * people have been much In
each other's company and now ,that the
real bride Js known tl\cre will be no sur
prise among their friends. The mystery
of the affair was heightened because the
bride's name was given as "Cummings,"
In an effort to conceal her Identity. She
used her mother's maiden name.

There was a panic this mornlns at the
Fred Finch Orphanage at Fruitvale
among scores of little inmates who werÂ«
driven out. half-naked, by a fire which
destroyed one of the buildings on tha
grounds. The blaze started In the gaao
llne engine house about 5 o'clock.
Boys from the orphanage ran half-clad
to the upper Fruitvale firehouse to sound
an alarm. They found no bell rope to
work. To reach the tall bell tower the
youngsters climbed like monkeys up- the
sides of the building, over the slippery
roof and then clanged the bell for dear
life.
Fruitvale storekeepers came to the res
cue. With flre extinguishers they has
tened to the orphanage. Neighbor;*
turned out and with th? larger boys an'l
rlrls and officers of the place formed a
bucket brigade.
A large outbuilding adjoining the engine
house was stored with gasoline. To save
this structure and Its Inflammable con
tents was the work of the volunteer corps.
It was saved and a serious spread of the
flames to the main building and dormi
tories was prevented.
The loss was not serious. Th<Â«re were
scores of children in tne main road bare
footed In their night clothes just as they
had been hurriedly aroused from their
beds. As soon as the . flre had been
checked the little ones were sent quickly
back to warm shelter.
Had there been unfavorable conditions
as to wind the buildings would have been
destroyed ia a afrort tlmo.

FEBOCIOUS BULLDOG
NEARLY KII/l^S A HORSE
Was Beaten Into Insensibility Before
He Would Loose His
Hold.
ELMHT7RST. Nov. 6.â A ferocious bull
dog belonging to Albert Barker attacked
a hay horse that was staked out in a field
yesterday, and before he was beaten off
he nearly killed the animal. The dog
hung to the horse's forelegs with his
teeth burled deep in the flesh and would
not let go. though the horse with his bur
den kicked and reared all over the Hold,
tearing up the Ftake that held him in his

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway, Nov. 6.
The Board of Education has elected
Fred L. Button, an attorney of this city,
to be a School Director in place of Robert
M. Price, who has resigned because he
has pore to Alaska to attend to business
Interest* there.
The board has made further suspension
of the rule requiring teachers In the pub
lic schools to reelde In Alameda County.
A number of Directors argued for further
suspension, because the rule did not pro
vide for residence in Oakland. The rule
-was originally adopted to prevent teach
ers residing In San Francisco. Di
rector WakeflHd contended that under
the ordÂ«T teachers could reside in portions
cf Alameda County much more remote
from Oakland than San Francisco. He
was therefore In favor of continuing the
FUffpenrlon now in fore*?.
The board ha* directed that fire drills

DAMAGING FIRE AT ALAMEDA.
From a Big Blaze.
ALAMEDA. Nov. fi.â Park street was
visited by a disastrous blaze which broke
cut this morning about half-past 1 oV:lock
In the rear of the building occupied by
Heritage & Gage, painters and paper
hangers. Buildings from 1334 to 1342, wÂ«th
a frontage on Park street of about 125
feÂ«t. were destroyed. These alone, it Is
estimated, were worth $13,000. Add to this
the loss on ptock and fixtures In the
burned stores and offices and the total
loss will probably come near $35,000.
Charles F. Fischer's plumbing shop was
wiped out. There was no Insurance on
It and the Iofs is calculated, to be $1200.
Fischer owned the building occupied by
Heritage & Gage. It was well covered by
insurance. Bruns & Strunz, coal and hay
dealers, lost about $2000. Five of their
horsts were burned to death. A. \. Lan
caster owned the building. It was an old
affair. The loss may reach $1500. S. L.
Potter'p building, which cost $8600 when
he bought it last spring from Mrs. Caro
line Stephenson, will havo to be rebuilt.

the Forty-sixth and Forty-eighth dis
tricts, where there was Republican dis
affection.
In the Forty-sixth District a fight was
made against John G. Mattos Jr.. the Re
publican nominee for the Assembly, be
cause he Is of Portuguese descent. There
was also disaffection upon the part, of
Deputy County Clerk J. C. Crooks of
Haywards, who was defeated by Mattos,
and the friends of Mattos claim that
Crooks made an effort to defeat his suc
cessful opponent. A strong effort was
made by the party managers to elect Mat
tos because of the great. Influence that he
wields among his countrymen.
In the Forty-eighth Assembly District
a flght was made against Joseph M.
Kelly, the Republican nominee, because
of factional differences In the Repub
lican party and because of Kelly's sup
port of Burns during the last Senatorial
tight. Had It not been for Kelly's Burns
affiliation he would have had a walkover
In the district. Many Republicans re

and some refused to vote for an Assem-
places the election officers found voters
waiting at the polls when they arrived at
6 o'clock to open the booths. The com
muters all voted before they left Oakland
for San Francisco and that accounted. In
a large measure, for the early voting. It
was estimated that by 9 o'clock one-third
of the entire vote of the cities of Oak
land, Alameda and Berkeley had been
cast and by noontime another third more
had, found its way Into the boxes.
There were several local fights, despite
the fact that there were but two Superior
Judges, six Assemblymen, one Senator
and three Supervisors to be elected, and
of these only the Judges ran at large In
the county. In some districts, such as
Alameda, the only officers to be voted for
were two Judges, an Assemblyman and
Presidential Electors.
The fights occurred In two Assembly
Districts and in each of the three Super*
vlsorlal Districts, the Democrats at

OAKLAND, Nov. 7, 12:30 a. m.â At this
hour IM precincts out of 141 give Metcalf
9329, Freeman 4.\59. Metcalfs majority,
4470. This would give Metcalf a majority
of over 50h0 in this county, and as the pre
cincts yet to be heard from are in the In
terior, where Metcalf is running ahead
of his ticket, it may run above this figure.
The indications are that Alameda
County will give McKinley 6000 majority,
or 1000 more than It gave him four years
asro.
Freeman a personal campaign for Con
press gained him a very few votes in
Oakland in former Democratic precincts,
but in general Victor H. Metcalf ran
ahoad of his ticket as a just recognition
of his services to bifl party in this cam

credit that not once durlnp the entire
campaign did he mention his own candi
dacy in .ill of the many speeches that hs
made. With great modesty be urged the

Town Gives President 1069 Plurality.
BERKELEY UPHOLDS McXINLEY
Some slight confusion was created by
the new election law and two prominent
gentlemen. John A- Britton, president o*
the Oakland Gas. Light and Heat Com
pany, and William G. Henshaw. president
of the Union Bank of Savings, lost their
votes from having removed after the ex
piration of the time allowed by law. One
candidate suffered In the same way.
Joseph Humphrey, the Prohibition candi
date for the Assembly In the Fiftieth As
sembly District, lost his vote by removing
and not being able to reregister.
The most bitter contest was in the j
Fourth District, where Councilman H.
D. Rowe was the Republican nominee. ;
In this district the Democrats nominated
John M. English, the only member of the !
English family who ha3 never held an j
office. Charles Roeth, the incumbent, who J
was defeated at the primaries by Rowe. i
ran as an Independent, and Walter TiÂ£- ]
fany. the master mechanic of the Oak- j
land Transit Company, also ran lnde- j
pendently. Roeth and Tiffany both draw-
Ing from the Republican nominee gave j
the Democrats great hope. Late last night |
the word was passed down the lin-? araont
a certain element in the Republican party
who wished to defeat Rowe to vott for
English. The desire was to defeat Rowe
at any cost and it was estimated that
English had the best chance. This fight,
like that in the Forty-eighth Assembly
Dlstiict, was a factional :>nÂ» in the Re
publican party.
In the Fifth District W. S. Pelouze. a
Republican, ran as an independent against
John Mitchell, and Thomas C. Landregan
gathered some hope from that fact.
Otherwise the election was all one way,
and that way was Republican.
Congressman Victor H. Metcalf was the
principal figure upon the streets of Oak
land to-day. His magnificent campaign
for the entire Republican ticket had at
tracted widespread attention and wher
ever he went he was the recipient of many
congratulatory compliments. He voted
early and then made a round of. the cen
tral precincts on foot in company with
Emil Nusbaumer. T. T. Dargie and Coun
ty Expert E. B. Bullock. Mr. Metcalf
modestly disclaimed any credit for hi*
wonderful campaign, saying that It was
no more than he ought to do. but never
theless it In generallv conceded that much
of the Republican success In the Third
District Is due to his efforts.
Supervisor W. H. Church made an open |
fight against Kelly in his district. Churcn !
has been fighting Kelly and Kelly haa ;
been fighting Church for years, and Kelly t
has threatened that If he Is successful at
this election he will run for Supervisor
against Church two years from now.
Church took advantage of all of the anil- )
Burns sentiment In the district an'l t!iÂ«
fight was very bitter. AM cf the efforts
of the party managers to heal the breach
were unavailing.
Thr- Democrats made an attempt to vln
in each of the three Supervisorial dis
tricts. In the First District C. F. Homer. I
the Republican nominee, had to contend I
with Thomas D. Wells of Dublin. Tha
fight was made upon clean lines an<! each
candidate manfully appealed to the voter*.

scrimmage he got the ball from Berrien
on a rumble and made a run of forty-five
yards for a touchdown, planting the ball
squarely behind the goal posts. In the
try at goal, however. Roper, who held the
ball for Mills, touched it down prema
turely and the Columbia men rushed in
and stopped the place kick, thus depriv
ing Princeton of the possibility of a goal,
though this technicality has seldom been
taken advantage of.

gained new charms for the spectators.
Then to show its patriotism, how the"
crowd did cheer for the American flag,
which replaced another bulletin. Then
Roosevelt's picture came in for a Ion?
share of the good natured ebullition, of
the vast throng.
Then as the bulletins continued to show
that McKinley had made gains in every
State the story became an old onÂ© and
after testifying in a variety of ways it3
satisfaction at the result, tho crowd be
gan to scatter. The exodus from "News
paper Corner" began at about 9 o'clock
when all doubt of McKinley's election
had been removed â¢ even from, the most
sanguine Democrat. But the crowd was
so great that though a constant stream
filed along Market street It made no sen
sible diminution in the number until two
hours after, when the thinning- out pro
cess began.
When The Call's perfect bulletin service
flashed the first Intelligence that the New
York Herald conceded . the election of
McKinley, and that he had undoubtedly
carried twenty-seven States with 2S4
electoral votes, many thought it time to
go home. Others took their places, how
ever, and it was nearly midnight before
the crowd had dispersed. Even then
large numbers remained to ascertain the
result of tlÂ»3 local "election.
The Bevir Club ; showed that It was
equal to the emergency. It paraded about
10:30 o'clock. Headed by a brass band,
the club left its- headquarters and
marched down Market street, followed by
hundreds of people. The members of tho
club to the nvmber of one hundred were
clad in their 2:ha.ki uniforms and with
their flambeaux made u picturesque ap
pearance.
Early In the evening venders made their
appearance on the streets, with lanterns
in the shape of a dinner pail on which
was Inscribed:
"Four more years of tho full dinner
pail."
These were disposed of In large num
bers and soon almost every one on the
street had one of the symbols of a pros-
Again when the bulletins noted i that
tv. eW T, rk> Illlnols and Indiana were in
the Republican column cries of derision
were heard for the preposterous claims
?Â£ $ he . Democrats, marie before election",
that those States would ko for Bryan.
..A^d how the crowd did yell when Mc-
Kinley s picture was posted after a bul
letin showing his Immense majority over
Bryan In certain precincts. The face of
the Chief Executive of the Nation, who
has been chosen to guide its destines for
another four years, seemed to have
ers for the- first time the glad tidings that
McKinley had been elected, such a mlghty
roar went up from thousands of throats
that It well-night shook the tall building.
While it was generally conceded up to
that time that McKinley was re-elected.
The Call was in a position to pive definite
Information on a point which was Involved
in slight doubt. When the bulletins con
tinued to be posted, which announced in
no uncertain terms the unparalleled suc
cess of the Republican ticket, such ex
pressions were heard as:
"Oh, what a. walkover for McKinley."
"Willie Bryan was knocked out in the
first half of the first round."
"What a. stampede in favor of JIcKln
ley."
during the course of the afternoon and
early evening to watch the returns. As
piptant Secretary Steppacher had ar
ranged to get bulletins from both of the
telegraph companies, and as fast as they
came in they were strung on wires. The
service was excellent and when the Mc-
Kinley dean-sweep bepan to be evident
the old war hor.Â«f>s frequently broke into
cheers. Major McLaughlin said he had
predicted all the time that MeKlnley's
majority in New York would be 200.000.
Colonel Stone was the proudest man in
the Stste and no one was busier or hap
plor than "Jake*! Stmnacher.
Sorrator Cuttor. secretary of the Repub
lican State Central Committee, went home,
to vote and did not return until late in
the afternoon. From the tfme of his ar
rival at hean'ou.T'tors he was active In
taking care of callers and figuring up re
sults.
Before 9 o'clock Colonel Stone sent the
following telegrams East:

a willingness to risk some of the money

As returns bepan to be received a few
party leaders drifted into the headquar

cheerful air at the Democratic strong

Not until late In the afternoon was

As early as 5 o'clock last evening the
people began to gather around The Call
building. Posts of vantage had been ap
propriated even earlier than that by men
whose faces denoted a keen desire for in
formation. As fast as the returns, which
denoted a sweeping : Republican victory,
were posted vociferous cheers resounded
up and down the street. When The Call's
immense red searchlight flashed through
the air denoting to the interested observ-
The crowd was well handled by a squad
of twenty policemen under the command
of Lieutenant Blrdsall. assisted by Ser
geants Gleason and Helms and Corporal
Williams. While at least 10,000 people re
mained watching the returns 50,000 or
more were kept constantly on the march
by the police officers. The crowd was
handled without a slnerle accident, though
often the passing streetcars came within
an ace of running down some enthusiastic
McKinley man, who. in his exuberance,
neglected to get off the track. Cars, both
going out and coming in, were crowded
on the outside and the passengers stand-
Ing up on the dummy would sometimes
brush against the fringe of the crowd,
but with no more serious results than the
loss of a few buttons or a tear, in the coat
of some luckless individual who stood too
near. >.*:
It was a surging, seething mass of
struggling -humanity that stood in the
vicinity of "Newspaper Corner," at the
Intersection of Market, Third and Kearny
streets last night. â¢ All sorts and condi
tions of men were- in the vast throng and
many ladies too 'were out to cull informa-:
tion from the bulletin boards. Around tho
entrance to the Cl&us Spreckel's building,
in which is located The Call business of
fice, the crowd was so thick that it lapped
over the car tracks and many times dur
ing the evening the street was impassable.
The interest of the many thousands of
spectators seemed to be concentrated at
that particular point and the enthusiasm
burst forth in cheers upon cheers when
ever a bulletin-telling of McKinley's vic
tories was posted. .
From every point of vantage people on
both sides of the bay and out on the
ships in the harbor waited for The Call's
messages. Signals of McKinley's victory
in California, in New York and through
out the nation flashed almost simultane
ously, and to., a" waiting people the truth,
and all of It, was told.
were Joined with the victorious host. The
lights that wrote thÂ«lr messages on the
clouds were all of carmine hue, McKin
ley's color. Not once was the green
brought into play, for the people at the
polls had willed otherwise.

STORY OF THE
CITY'S BALLOTS
In strong contrast to the scene of re
joicing at the Republican headquarters
was the deserted condition of the Demo
cratic commitiee rooms Tifter 10 o'clock.
The party managers slipped away one by
one to lose themselves in the crowd on
the streets, untH a single clerk and tele
graph operator were left alone to receive
and arrange the returns. The operator
was of Republican persuasion, so all was
not sadness as the instrument ticked off
the news of Democratic defeat.
opened freely. Among those who spent
the evening or part of it there were Henry
J. Crocker, ex-Judge Van Fleet. Frank
L. Coombs. Major Belknap, Wakefleld
Baker, Julius Kahn, Colonel F. E. Beck,
Morris Sweltzer. Louis Brandt. E. S. Hel
ler. Justice McFarland and Colonel Ko
walsky.
Gaston Ashe, brother of the candidate
for Congressman, met T. H. Williams Jr.
in front of the Palace Hotel early in the
evening and rushed toward him. By
standers who knew they had not spoken
for years thought there was going to be
a mlxun, but Ashe only wanted to bet.
He said he had wagered all his ready
money, but he would- stake a carload of
potatoes on his brother's chances. Wil
liams readily agreed and the bet was duly
made.

OAKLAND, Nov. 6.â The Board of Pub
lic Works last night passed a resolution
rescinding all the proceedings that have
been -taken in the matter of opening
Washington street through from Four

perous Republican administration In his
possession. Inside the pall was a lighted
candle and the bauble made- a decided hit
wherever it *appeared.\ ,
"The great searchlight that flamed
election results across the heavens from
the lantern" of The Call building Is among
the finest ever placed in position in the
West," said Henry J. Wolters, chief en
gineer of the Claus Spreckels building, late
last evening. â¢ "The: installment of the
signal plant -was completed Sunday even
ing. Through the courtesy of D. D. "Wass
I was able to. secure a 65- Ampere search
light. To the layman this statement Is
meaningless, but for those who do not
understand the power represented In the
figures named I will^say that the light is
of enormous, almost Incalculable candle
power. Â¦ ' .. --.':'-'Â¦Â¦;;;.-'Â¦:. ,-.\;
"This light was placed in position on
the rim, as it were, of the lantern of tho
dome. Telephonic communication was
established between the men at the light
and the telegraphic receivers In The Call
business office. The same communication
was also established with the seventeenth
floor, where six men were engaged hand
ling colored fires and rockets. On the sec
ond floor of The Call building a stereoD
tlcon projecting plant was established to
throw upon the screen stretched In front
of the building the election .returns as
soon as received. Results were communi
cated to the operators of the stereoptlcon'
the" searchlight and: the fireworks men
simultaneously. Thus even sooner than
the people on^ Market street could read
the bulletins from the screen the news
.was known to all who resided in the bav
cities, for the great searchlight signals
were visible for many miles around
i'There was but one portion of the ar
rangement , which, through - force of cir
cumstances, we were unable to thorough
ly test. That was the green light end of
the programme. Green was Bryan' 3
color, but early, in the game we laid the
green paraphernalia aside to make room
for more red, , and until morning the
heavens were as > lurid :as when Nero
fiddled near., burning Rome."
One of the Democratic Electors Chal
lengedâSaloon-Keepers Must
Pay for Violating
the Law.
William T. Baggett, one of the Bryan
electors, lost his vote yesterday, as did
many other citizens through the same
mistake. Within the past thirty days
William T. Baggett was a guest at . the
St. Nicholas Hotel. He then . moved to
the Strathmore Hotel. His right to vote
was therefore challenged on the ground
that he had not resided thirty days in
the precinct before the day of election.
Every policeman was notified by orders
of Chief Sullivan Monday night to warn
licuor men on their beats strictly to ob
serve the' law in keeping their saloons
closed on election day on pain of being
brought before the Police Commissioners,
besides running the risk of being arrested
for selling liquor. The law Â¦was obeyed
except in a few instances. Matthew
Grimm, saloon-keeper, 113 Leldesdorff
street, was arrestel by Sergeants Gleeson
and H. J. Wright.
Herman Willers. who keeps a saloon on
Sacramento street, was arrested by Cor
poral Eagan, while other members ot the
harbor police arrested Simon Carlson,
bartender for Otto Hansen. and T. O.
Mahoney, bartender for a saloon on Pa
cific street.
As a rule the water front observed the
law, but some of the men who kept their
places open apparently without detection
have had their names taken and are likely
to hear from the Commissioners next li
censing day.
HOW BAGCKETT LOST
A VOTE Â» FOR HIMSELF
OnÂ© of the Bitterest Contests Waged
in the City Against Corruption in
the Forty-First District.
In the Forty-first Assembly District a
battle royal was In progress all day long.
Republicans united with Democrats to de
feat Henry C. Dibble and hundreds of
votes normally Republican were cast for
his Democratic .opponent, Oscar Sutro.
A very heavy vote was cast and before
2 o'clock most of the electors had cast
their ballots. Although the legislative
contest was bitter there were no disturb
ances, no illegal voting and no open cor
ruption on the part of Dibble s cham
pions. Generally speaking the election
v/as outwardly one of the quietest in the
history of the district. *%'i;-' ~^ : i. 'Â¦â¢
The same story .. may be tola for the
Forty-second District, where a stubborn
fight by good . citizens, irrespective or
party, was made to defeat L. A. Henry.
In the broad area embodied in the Mis
sion district and including one-half of the
city and four Assembly districts, there
v/ere but two men arrested during the
dny Otherwise the entire section was
as dull, as far as election excitement
v;"ent. as if there had been no election.
All work was suspended at the big manu
facturing institutions in the Potrero. The
Union Iron Works, the Risdon Iron Works
and the Western Sugar Refinery were
closed down during the entire day
to afford the employes a chance to vote.
