General Humphrey, the chief quartermas
ter, and he will leave for Shanhaikwan
next week to confer with his colleagues
and inspect the port and railway facili
ties. The Germans, wti-j were said to be
the best equipped force in the allies, have
disclosed some serious defects when
brought face to face with the campaign
conditions In China. In the matter of
transportation they are weak and the
British were called upon to help them out
in the Paoting-Fu expedition. The loss^f
a horse ship was one cause and the fact
that they arrived too late to secure mules
cn the ground practically left them help
less. The German baggage train on the
Paoting-Fu column was rather a sharp
contrast to the purely military portion of
their outfit. Their line wagons were
drawn by teams of native ponies and
donkeys with Improvised harness of ropes.
Many of their, officer* are mounted on
little native ponies, while another source
of embarassment is the unbroken Amer
ican hcrses which were shipped directly
here for the use of the cavalry, i
At present It Is understood that the
Americans will keep only a depot guard
here for the- winter. Under orders from
General Chaffee little of the property
held by the United States forces has been
surrendered or allowed to go out of their
possession*. It will be held merelv as a
precautionary measure in the event of
developments necessitating the return of
a larger force than is now contemplated.
No definite plans for a winter base have
as yet been made, but it is practically
certain that Shanhalkwan will be se
lected.

The a.dnalnijstra.tlon has carefully con

pendent negotiations. The danger of such
action, however, is so apparent that It Is
deemed unwise to take it. With 1 no re

would Insist upon demands which China
under no possibility could accept, and. the
danger of partition would become even

Between the courses open of the rejec
tion of the terms and withdrawal from the
concert, or thsir acceptance after trying
to modify them, there is seemingly but
one view taken at the White House. That
is, that co-operation with tfce powers must
continue.
In agreeing to the foregoing terms Min
ister Conger violated the instructions of
the Secretary of State, who directed that
he should only agree to the list of dam-
Eges â¢which he was reasonably sure would
be accepted and could be carried out by
thÂ« Imperial Government of China. In
anticipation that the Ministers would per

the Secretary cabled the American repre
sentative* abroad the text of the instruc

thi powers not to put tha civilized world
in an untenable position by Insisting upon
terms which the Chinese Government
could not fulfill.
The European situation from the stand
point of this Government Is highly satis
factory, especially In the light of the re
plies received thus far to the American
representations. Germany's policy of
vengeance seems to have but one support

seems to be preparing to abandon its po

given assurances of Its desire to co-op

WASHINGTON, Nov. 2G.â The Treasury
Department to-day decided to admit the
laceworkers and their families who were
brought to this country by Dr. J. A.
Dowie, the "divine healer" and the found
er of Zion City. 111., to teach others the
k art of lacemaklng. This is a reversal of
the action of the Philadelphia immigra
tion officials, who had decided that the
lacemakers should not be admitted to this
country.
Commissioner General Powdcrly, in his
letter to the Commissioner of Immigra
tion at Philadelphia directing that the
lacemakers be admitted, said:
"It appears that it is the purpose of
Dr. John A. Dowie, who had arranged
with the appellants, to manufacture
not only lace, . but also the thread
from which such lace is to be made. Al
though lacemaklng -' in ' some of its
branches has been ." carried on in this
country for some years heretofore, it
seems to have been the practice to Im
port the thread used In such establish
ments. .The department is of the opin
ion that said industry is a new one, not
established, and as it is not claimed or
shown by the representatives of the lace
makers' union that labor could have been
obtained In this country to prosecute the
industry, there Is apparently no violation
of the alien contract labor laws." ,
It is held that the immigrants come
within the law's exception. It is also held
that they are not likely to become public
charges.

RIFLE. Colo.. Nov. 25.â Game Commis
sioner Johnson and his deputies -arrived
at Rifle last night and proceeded to Meek
er by stage to-day. It is a forty-five mile
ride and will require the entire day.
While the Commissioner was here he re
ceived reports from ranchmen which In
dicate that the slaughter of game has
been unprecedented in the history of the
State. Old timers in this country predict
trouble with the Indians before they are
finally removed to their reservations.
DENVER, Nov. 26.â Adjutant General
Overmeyer to-day wired Troop A, 'cav
alry, at Grand Junction to be in readiness
for an immediate call in case Game Com
missioner Johnson's force should not be
able to expel the Indian hunters from tffe
White River country.
This troop is known as Overmeyer's
Rough Riders, and is made up of pioneers,
cowboys and crack shots of the Western
slope. There are sixty men In the troop
and General Overmeyer shipped forty sad
dles, bridles and ammunition for a two
weeks' campaign through the mountains.
This troop of cavalry is much closer to
the scene of the Indian depredations than
the Denver troops and could be on the
ground within twenty-four hours from re
ceipt of notice to start.
Fear is expressed at the capital that
Commissioner Johnson will make the at
tack on the Indians against overwhelming
odds.
Governor Thomas received a communi
cation from Secretary of the Interior
Hitchcock at Washington stating that the
Government has sent its Indian agent to
6cour Northwestern Colorado for ma
rauding Indians, but had failed to find
one. There was a hint In the communica
tion that thiB would end the correspond
ence so far as the Government -was con
cerned. Instead of pacifying the Gover
nor, it has a tendency to make him more
vigorous in his application of the State
laws. He claims to have a dozen reports
from as many different men on file prov
ing conclusively that the Indians have
slaughtered over 500 deer in Routt and
Rio Blanco counties.
From telegrams received it has devel
oped that it is not the Ulntahs and Un
compaÂ«hre Utes that are making the
trouble this year, but the White Rivers,
who oneÂ© occupied the territory which
they have invaded. In the past the In
dian agents have kept the White Rivers
on the reservation because of the bitter
feeling of the tribe toward the whites,
who. they claim, took possession of lands
belonging to them without right or treaty.
It is reported that even a larger num
ber of Indians than the 500 previously re
ported have left the reservation and aro
slaughtering hundreds of deer in the vi
cinity of the Yuma and White rivers.
The fact that so many of the redskins
have left the reservation gives rise to the
belief that they have planned to obtain
revenge for the Meeker massacre and the
killing of squaws and bucks three years
ago.
. As soon as the ranchmen are advised
that trouble Is brewing there will be a
rush for Rifle and Meeker.
Commissioner! Johnson will station pick
ets at the State line to prevent the pas
sage of the Indian pack trains with their
tons of plunder from the State.' He Is de
termlmKl to arrest some of the Indians
with game In their possession If possible,
In order to have the laws regarding Indian
raids tested.

CAVALRY AFTER
COLORADO REDS
Tendency in Congress Will
Be Rather Toward Dis
, organization. .
CALL BUREAU, WELLINGTON HO
TEL. WASHINGTON, Nov. 26.âPredic
tions are being made here freely that tho
Democrats In Congress will show such de
moralization at this session as to make
any attempt at .caucus action impossible.
The tendency, it is paid, will rather be to
ward disorganization than reorganization.
Senator Jones, chairman of the Demo
cratic National Committee, who is here,
eays: "There Is no n-jed for reorganiza
tion." Just as William C. Whitney re
cently said in effect: "There is nothing
to reorganize "
There is a strong sentiment against con
tinuing Bryan as the lawgiver of the party
â as a sort of Moses or Jefferson, so to
speakâ and this anti-Bryan sentiment will
be manifest In an attack upon Senator
Jones. This will be made for the purpose
of breaking down Bryan's influence, as
Senator Jones is regarded as the represen
tative here of everything that Bryan
stands for.
Many Democrats refuse to accept Sen
ator Jones' statement that Bryan is not
likely to be a candidate for President
ag.iln. They want more positive assur
ances and, failing in getting them, they
want Bryan killed off, so that there can
be a new deal and a new candidate.
This hostility to Bryan is likely to be
shown in the attitude of many Democrats
during the short session of Congress. The
bill to reorganize the army and increase
the permanent establishment will be sup
ported by some Democrats. The opposi
tion Is not likely to be of that Irreconcil
able character which was manifest toward
"militarism" by Bryan in the campaign.
One of the differences as to the policy
to be followed by the minority with refer
ence to this matter will be as to whether
the opposition should be stubborn and de
termined or merely perfunctory. ;
Should the Philippine question come up
in any way for legislation It will develop
that some Democrats are only lukewarm
in their support of the attitude taken by
the party in the recent campaign. If the
currency question comes, up much indiffer
ence is likely to appear on the part of the
legular Democrats. .while those who have
heretofore been out of harmony with their
party on this question will be subjected to
less pressure and criticism. The ship sub
sidy bill will have the active support of
some Democrats and some Republicans
have clearly indicated that they have no
intention of punishing the South in the
for the curtailment of
the negro franchise. There Is likely to be
more than the usual acquiescence on the
part of the Southern Democrats in tho
general programme of the majority for
tho session, especially in the Senate on
the ratification of the Hay-Pauncefote
treaty. . Â¦ .â¢
DEMOCRATS MAY

Phillips* conduct to-day won him great
praise. Few men have been able to keep
a cool head under like circumstances. He
parted with 300.000 bushels, about one
tenth of his holdings. He bought 100.000
when the bears tried to drag him off his
pedestal. He made $30,000. Apparently he
is going to keep the settling price around
50 cents. If the "shorts" are meditating
a coup on the last day they may wake up
to find that Phillips has closed out his
line. He claims now that ho cannot be
squeezed, whatever may happen. As long
as he keeps on selling more than he buys
and holds the market down to 50 cents he
Is seemingly too nimble to be crowded off
the market with his corner. Other specu
lators have been broken by buying at a
big price in order to hold up the market
and paying out their funds on margins.
George A. Seaverns is said to be giving
aid to Phillips. Some think the elevator
man is backing his former employe In
the trade. At any rate, the drying and
cleaning house of Seaverns, which in the
past has been able to turn out contract
corn with great rapidity in times of stress,
has not added a bushel to the supply since
the Phillips corner has developed. JJr.
Seaverns' inactivity is not credited to pure
benevolence in the success of his former
employe.
To-day's price of corn is the highest
since June, 1895, when a predicted famine

corn felt the influence of the short grad
ing in November and went up % cent over

The excited market was the unmistak
able admission of the corn trade that
Phillips has a "cinch" on his corner. Some
of the other brokers who tried to nurse a
little corner in November corn last sum
mer and who got tired about the time
they had worked the bulk of the contract
corn off the market and left a smooth
path for their successor, envy the little
fellow, but they are not throwing any
thing in his path.
tried to sell corn at forty-seven and a
half cents. Phillips turned Instantly from
seller to buyer, from bear to bull, and
Bnapped up every man who was offering
to shade the price that he was making.
The decline stopped at once. Phillips
showed to the corn pit that he was its
master; that he could regulate It at will.
The followers who tried to get somo of
the corn king's money in the delusion that
he was weakening are now wondering
where they will get off on Friday. The
closing price was forty-nine cents, a re
action due to Phillips' buying. It was
significant to some traders that the firms
who were reputed to be at the mercy of
Phillips have not given any sign of excite
ment or worry. They have not shown
their hands in the pit. They are watch-
Ing affairs as closely as the king of the
golden cereal. There is still some talk of
special trains coming from the country
with corn enough to make good the obli
gations to Phillips. To the outsider there

CHICAGO, Nov. 26.â During the
forenoon to-day November corn,
the. visible supply of which has
been cornered by George H. Phil
lips, sold twice at fifty cents. Mr.
Phillips having been sustained by the
board committee in rejecting for contract
new corn which had gone through a dry
ing process, and encouraged by the small
receipts of corn of a grade which may be
delivered on contracts, was quoted to
day as asserting his entire confidence that
he controls the market. The market
opened one cent higher than the close
Saturday, the first bid being forty-six
cents per bushel. This was bid by Mr.
Phillips, and within an hour and a half
the price went to fifty cents. At this fig
ure the young speculator made two salea
aggregating 100,000 bushels. The price bid
following the first sale at fifty cents was
forty-nine and a half cents, but as no corn
was forthcoming the next bid was at the
tcp figure. A little later Mr. Phillips let
out a small line at forty-eight cents.

All Attempts to Crowd Out the Little
Corn King Are Failures.
CHICAGO. Nov. 26.â November corn
touched fifty cents to-day. It made an
advance of five cents for the day, of ten
cents a bushel for the week, and of al
most fifteen cents within four weeks.
Young Mr. Phillips sold what corn
changed hands at that point; shorts did
the buying that advanced the market to
the fifty-cent quotation. The five-cent ad
vance over the close of last week made
the day a notable one for the campaign.
A roar and a cheer gave notice of the half
dollar achievement and there was a flock
ing toward the already overcrowded corn
pit from all over the floor. The tip- top
figure was mafle in the first hour. Novem
ber starting at forty-six cents, selling be

OF CASTELLANE
CHICAGO, Nov. 26.â The delegates to
the ninth annual convention of the Na
tional Irrigation Congress, which closed
last' Saturday, unanimously' declared that
greater interest in Irrigation of the arid
lands of the United | States had been
arousrd by this convention than any pre
viously held.
"We believe that the Chicago convention
of the Natior.ul Irrigation Congress has
accomplished a great object," saul Georjje
H, Maxwell; chairman of the executive
committee. "It has placed before the pto
ple of the whole of the United States the
importance of the problem of national ir
rigation, and has particularly brought it
to the- attrition cl the pcopie of the fcust
in a rL.anr.er not otherwise possible. A
genuine interest in the subject seems to
have been awaiem-a. So mucn good would
result from the carrying out or the policy
by the natlor.nl Government and result in
bo many ciiftorent ways that people who
have no Interest In irrigation useif are
being attracted to the idea.
"It would accomplish the coionization of
the West and the creation of a great mar
ket for manufacturing; it wouici result in
the employment ot ia~or, the development
of mnnng, in assistance to n.ivigatiou, in
the pie\eiuion oi aoous una in reliet fur
the congested conuuion Â».Â«i our cities in
supply ii.fi liiitteriai lor tnousanus or .-unau
rural ncines.
"Last year," continued Mr. Maxwell,
"Chtcago vus fixed upon as me nieetins
place lor this year's congress, and woix
was at once begun by tho National irri
gation Association to bring me subject
uefore ihe pcopie of tne Â£a*t tnrougn
their commercial organizations. Tne mer
chants of lx>s Angeies began the worJCjby
correspondence vwtli several thousand of
the Eastern merchants ana .manufac
turers who rind a market tor their goods
in that city, a city which is a magnifi
cent object lesson of tne niarveioun trans
formation that water will work in the
West. The merchants of St. Paul and
Omaha next took up the work of organiza
tion through similar correspondence, and
finally a large number of merchants and
manufacturers of Chicago extended to the
movement 'their strong influence anil sup
port, and likewise took up the matter by
correspondence with other Eastern mer
chants and manufacturers. As. a result
of this work the membership of the Na
tional Irrigation Association now com
prises nearly a thousand of the leading
mercantile concerns of the United States,
and has a membership extending from
California to Maine and from Minnesota
to Texas.' Agricultural, commercial, hor
ticultural ami labor organizations from
one end of the country to the other have
strongly indorsed the irrigation movement
by resolutions and given to it their earnest
aid and co-operation."
"Have not the Kastern people, however,
been inclined to consider the proposition
wholly a Western question?" he was
asked. Â¦
"We have heard much of Kastern oppo
sition," said Mr. Maxwell, "but I have
yet to find a single Eastern business man
not in hearty accord with the movement
as coon as it is explained to him. The act
ive co-operation of the labor organizations
bears this out. The movement has tln
ally crystallized Into a sentiment which is
essentially national in its broadest sense,
and the organizations that are now enlist
ing in 'the national irrigation movement
are not promoting it from any local or
sectional point of view, but from a convic
tion, that the planting of American civili
zation and the building of homes for fifty
million new citizens under the American
flag in places which are now waste -and
desolate- is a national purpose which de
mands support from every eltizen in every
section of the country, because the far
reaching and widespread benefits from the
reclamation of this vast area of virgin
territory would create a national pros
perity in which all would share.".
"Is politics likely to enter into the
question to any extent?".
"The great political parties of the coun
try in their platforms in the last cam
paign both indorsed it and hence the
movement is in no sense partisan or po
litical. It rises to the highest and the pur
est patriotism, and the motto of the move
ment. 'Save the forests and store the
floods." is one which can be subscribed to
bv every citizen of the United States, east
and west. â¢
"The great stimulation of business and
production incident to the colonization of
tlip Middle "West, where men went out :irrl
took up from ICO to C40 acres each and
made homes for themselves, would be
fmiiill compared with what would occur if
100.000,000 acres of arid land, which would
bo inexhaustibly fertile, is given water and
divided Into ten and twenty acre highly
cultivated farms. These facts the Chlcapo
irrigation conpress has presented to the
people of the East and they are studying
them." .'

the better part of these vast deposits
have been tiled by miners employed by
Thomas Mapnon. The manager of the
Apollo gold mines at Unga says the veins
uncovered to date are four and a half,
five and nine feet thick, containing ex
cellent lignite and bituminous coals. In
the spring diamond drills will be employed
to determine the depth and continuity of
the deposits and development will com

situated near tidewater and only five
miles distant is a sheltered harbor where
steamers or sailing vessels can load in
safety. The deposits are so large as to
make certain a permanent supply for
Alaskan towns. This alone will affect the

SAX JOSE, Xov. 25. â A movement look
ing to a greater San Jose was in3ticuted
at the meeting of the City Council this
morning. Councilman Macaulay brought
it up and Mayor Martin was empowered
to appoint a special committee of three
to have charge of Hie plan of extension.
The limits- of San Jone have noi been
extended since the city was organized,
and the territory encompassed is the
smallest of any city in the State. Ad
jacent and immediately tributary to the
cily is a population of about 14.0O0. With
these suourbs annexed San Jose would
have a population of 35,w.>0, instead or
il,60u as given by the late census. Thus
it would ranK as fourth city in the State-
It is proposed to extend the limits on
the north, east and west. On the east
there is East San Jose, with a population
of several thousand, and to the west there
is the thlcklv settled Crandalivihe and
Alameda. A "large number could be added
on the north, in the vicinity of the Hotel
Vcndome.
Most of the pecple in these suburbs are
employed in the city and depend upon it
fcr everything. The localities lack police
and lire protection and sewers and it Is
believed the offering of these will prove
strong inducements to bring them in.

The first alarm of fire was given this
morning when a lad rushed into the pres
ence of Miss Cora U. Edgington and an
nounced that the building was ablaze. He
then left to join the flre brigade, which
was already at work. The fire alarm was
not given until all the children upstairs
had been taken from the building. In the
meantime little Gerrold. being the oldest,
collected his flre company and set at
work. ' " .
Two lines of hose were unreeled and the
water turned on. The little fellows here
forced their way into the cellar. The
smoke was suffocating and the flames
gave forth a heat that might have driven
back grown people. The children dragged
their hose right under the burning ceiling,
upon which they poured the streams. The
flre had made great headway. The
walls and- ceiling of the basement were a
sheet of flames. Soon the ceiling fell and
the flames shot upward to the *story
above. It looked for many minutes as
though the building would go.

and rushed back and forth through the
smoke-tilled building; each contributing
his mite of water to the hungry flames.

STOCKTON, Nov. 26.â Thomas Cun

of San Joaquin County, died sud
denly at Tuttletown. Tuolumne
County, at 5 o'clock this morning
of apoplexy. News of his demise, when
received in local official circles this fore
noon and among the old residents of the
city, caused widespread regret. He spent
last nigrht with W. C. Ralston at the Me
lones mine and left there at an early hour
this morning for Jamestown, where he in
tended boarding the train for his home in
Stockton. On (he way to Tuttletown he
told Barlow, the driver, that he found it
difficult to brea:he. On reaching Tuttle
town to said to the driver:
"I can't stani this any longer; I've got
to get out."

Ex-Sheriff Cunningham left Stockton
Saturday afternoon for Angels Camp. He
had been importuned to be present at the
Republican ratification on Saturday night
and made the trip to the mountains
against his own wishes.
The news of his death was immediately
sent to this city to his family and to the
Sheriff's office, when arrangements were
commenced in preparation for receiving
the body. Congressman-elect Samuel D.
Woods arranged for a special train on the
Sierra road from Oakdale to Jamestown
and for the proper transfer at Oakdale on
the return to this city.
When court convened at 10 o'clock this
morning many lawyers were present and
Judges Budd and Jones sat in bank. Con
gressman-elect Woods arose and made a
touching speech, referring to the magnifi
cent qualities of the deceased and charac
terizing him as beinr as gentle as a
woman and brave as a Hon. He moved
that a committee be appointed to arrange
for the funeral from the standpoint of of
ficial life and that court adjourn ln re
spect to the memory of the dead. Jud^e
Budd and Judge Jones both spoke briefly,
eulogizing the ex-Sheriff. Ansel Smith.
Frank H. Smith and J. E. Budd were ap
pointed a committee, and court adjourned
for a week.
The train bearing the body arrived here
shortly alter 5 o'clock, and the dead ex-
Sheriff was removed to the family home.
The funeral will occur at 10 o'clock on
Thursday morning. The services are to
take place at the Central M. E. Church,
the largest edifice in the city. The gen.

When the State determined to rid its
borders of the terrible bandit Vasquez,
Tom Cunningham and Harry Morse rode
at the head of a posse. They followed the
murderers and their notorious cutthroat
leader farther and farther to the south,
and nnally drove tram into the trap which
wad sprung by waiting officers. For
weeks the posse was in the saddle, ready
to fight at a minute's notice. There was
no place Cunningham would not explore
in que&t of his prey.
There is a story that one day, while out
on an independent tcout, he observed rid
ing over a little knoll a man whom he took
for a cowboy. As there was nothing sus
pic.ous about the man Cunningham did
not hall him. This man, it was afterward
learned, was Vasquez. The tandit, when
captured, said he could have got the drop
on Cunningham. "When asked why he was
so merciful, he made his most winning
bow, placed his hand over his heart and
with the mock courtesy bo characteristic
of the villain, said in Spanish;
"I could not kill the brave young man."
A few years ago there was a stage
robber named Dalton. He had caused

officer who laid hands on him was prac

Cunningham observed a man, whom he
was sure was the robber, standing on
Hunter square watching a game. Without
a moment s hesitation Cunningham
walked up to him and, covering him with
a pistol said quietly: -Don't move/' He
then called a citizen, who relieved Dalton
of his weapons and the Sheriff led the
man-eater away a most docile prisoner.

TULARE'S CITRUS
FAIR IS OPENED
Time â 3-16, :1SH: 5-16, :43: 5Hf. 1:09. Good start except Galanthus. Won first three driving
"Winner, J. F. Schorr's b. c. by imp. Newcoi:rt-Malada. Daneerfield is near a Rood one*.
Galanthus not straight when barrier went up. Scotch P.elle stepped merrily for a few
prnels. Scallywag correctly named.' Scratchedâ Loneliness 101.
At this evenins's Dractlce the public
were admitted to the side lines for the
last time. The next tv.o days will be de
voted to signal practice in secret. In the
fifteen minute scrimmage which; took
place the second team with big Gregory
at center was able to score on the Varsity
by u series of smashing plays. The big
eleven stubbornly resisted the onslaughts,
but were unable to stop the steady gains
made by the "scrubs." Â¦ The fight between
Smith and Erb for right half is the sharp
est on the field, with the chances slightly
In favor of the latter on account of his
ability in backing up the line. Stanford
took Luck's place at left end this evening:
and may yet win out. He Is fast, heady
and a sure tackier, but new at the posi
tion. McFadden will cccupy the other
end at the first kick off. The other posi
tions on the team were filled as usual.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Nov.
26.â The Varsity football squad completed
Its last hard work of the season this
evening and is now ready for the big con
test with the blue and gold Thursday.
The work of the day commenced with sig
nal practice at 10:30 this morning. Quar
terback Haltt was strain In his position
after an absence of twelve days. While
he Is not as sure at passing as when he
left, he will be thoroughly fitted into the
mechanism of the team in the next two
days. Coach Yost has the assistance of
a host of alumni coaches who have
flocked back to the campus to aid In the
difficult task of putting on the polishing
touches. Among them are Code, Down
ing, Frankenhelmer. Fickert, Murphy,
Reynolds and Lewers. Each of the ex-
Varsity stars acts as a special coach for
the man who occupies the position he
formerly played, f
Eleven Flays Smashing
Ball. '
STAUFOED'S TEAM IS

Raitt Occupies His Position and the
13U5. BIXTH RACEâ Five and a half furlonga; Belling; Hwo-year-olds; pursS, J350.
J.udglng from the jubilant attitude of
the men on the inside. California's pros
pects are far from blue.
The work of the backs justified Kelly's
statement to the men before the game:
"California has as tine a back field as any
team in the country." This relieves tho
Berkeley men of a great load of anxiety,
for the Stanford offensive has been con
sidered far superior to anything the btQe
and gold could produce. Smith and Gam
mon seem to be a trifle- over trained, but
the coaches have promised to bring them
both out in good condition.
The eleven lined up as it will on Thurs
day with tho exception of Pringle, who la
still guarding: his knee jealously, and
Hudson, who is nursing a wrenched arm.
In the practice the team played in splen
did style, going at tbe game with a vim
and working together In perfect unison.
The line tore up tremendous holes in the
opposing secona eleven and let Gammon,
Duden and Smith through for long gains.
Plunkett, the crack veteran guard, played
that position on the second eleven oppo
site Overall. The comparison between the
play of the two giant linemen was not un
favorable to the work of the big fresh
man novice. He is considered to be play
ing a star game considering his greenness
at the position.
BERKELEY, Nov. 26.-The last open
practice of the California University team
took place this afternoon. Light practice
will be indulged in on Tuesday and signal
work on Wednesday.
Closing Practice at Berkeley

large number of ladles, many of them ele
gantly attired and accompanied by es
corts and all enjoyed the fun of the even
injr as much as if they were at a three
ring circus. A feature of the hospitality
of the hosts was the distribution to the
audience of two barrels of roasted pea
nuts ami fifty frallona o f lemonade. There
were clowns by the dozenâ members of the
parlor who acted with a naturalness that
was most remarkable. "When they were
not in the 'ring they were kept out of mis
chief by being detailed by the committee
to distribute the peanuts and refresh
ments.
The prand entree was made up of a
cavalcade of men and women mounted
on steeds, each his or her own steed. The
Roman army was composed of F. E. Bert,
John W. Lewis, Joe Greenberp. J. G. Cox.

A. F. Schleichrr, and such Romans is
they were. Then followed an aggregation
of animals such as has never been seen
outside of that circus ring.
The programme opened wfth wrestling
bouts between J. Splro and G. A. Hinslley.
and F. P. Bayly and W. F. King, followed
by boxing contests bv M. J. Breen and
"Babe" Sherry, and \V. J. Leonard and
D. Carroll of local f. thletie fa mo. The
drill of the Roman armv was picturesque,
and a reproduction of the attempted as
sassination of Bussyrl'Ainboiso v.-as a goo]
exhibition of fencing by I... Tronchet and
K. rfndO. Kehrlin. Mile. Devor'on appeared
in the ring with two magnificent trick
ponies, which were let down to the ban
quet hall by the elevator, and gave an
Interesting exhibition of horsemanship
and of tricks by the animals. A burlesque
donkoy act with a live donkey followed.
The sreat event was a parodv on bare
back ridinp by Billy Smith, personating
Miss Smithereens. That was a very
amusing travesty which brought down
the house. The proKramme closed with
a concert and side shows, in which Mi.-ts
Anna Shean, George Hammersmith, the
Montgomery Sisters. A. Roncovleri, Little
Harrold, H. H. Walton and McMahon and
Gleason took part.

Track Notes.
INSTEAD of beinsr confronted with a
muddy track at Tanforan Park yes
terday, tho students of form were
surprised to seo a course that
looked as if five hundred laborer-*
mipht have been employed i<> hold um
brellas over it. The traces of Sundays
rainfall were scarcely perceptible, am!
though the track was not fast, it could
be termed pood. Although several piping
hot ones right off the coals were served
tp favorites more than held their own by
capturing four of the Fix events run off.
If "Billy" Cahill has not a stake colt
In. Rolling- Boer, he possesses a two-year-
Old that answers all the requirements of
one. Picking up 125 pounds in the third
number, the little bay won, pricking his
ears, from Bedeck and Bab. I-Cenilworth
eJao started, but was hustled off at such
a ding-dong clip by Nash Turner that
h<? was all out lor.g before the wire was
reached.
The complexion of one race did not suit
the officials. It was the mile and seventy
yard run, with only four starters, for
which Wooster Boy was almost backed
off the boards. Hildreth's horse made a
runaway affair of it, with The Lady sec
ond acii <iold Or tnird. Herculean w;is
practically left. The judges were not sat
isfied with i he efforts of Bereen, who
piloted 'The Lady, and suspended that
rider pendinp further Mivestigration.
Pete liomigh's mare. High Hoe, upset
mattr-rs at the very commencement, tak
ing the first event in a driving linish from
Osmond and Plohn. Mocorito. tho favor
ite, made the running until well into the
etretoh. when she gave it up.
80 open did the peven-furlong selling
event look that a fair price was obtain
able apainst any one of the ten starters.
At first old Salvation, on the shelf for
over two years, was installed favorite, but
his warming up trial, which was not flat
tering, sent the odds back. Then came
a rush to pet aboard Dr. Bernays, making
the gelding post choice. A wise selection
to be sure, for the Doctor galloped circles
around the bunch after celling: none the
hotter of the start and won with consid
erable to spare. Imperious, the pace
maker, took thÂ« place from Moringa.
A shabby genteel looking array of
plafrs furnished some hard guessing in
the second edition of the seven-furlong
run. It resulted in Maxello. a 4 to 1 shot
with Coburn up. coming in first, ahead of
E!pht Dollars and Meadow Lark. E?pi
rando was plunged, on in the early betting
and did show in the lead for half a block.
Ijou Rey. another extensively played one,
had a tortuous trip.
J. Miller astr!de Dangerfield. the Schocr
entry, pathpred thp last purse. The colt
always ruled favorite, and alter getting ,
away from the post tenth collared Nellie
Korri'st in the ttretch and â¢won in a mild
crive. David Â§ ran into the show.

THE circus maximus given by

thing of the past, but the features
of the event will be long and pleasantly
remembered by 700 persons, the majority

SECRETARY GAGE ON
MEANING OF "STUDENTS"
These cf the Chinese Variety Must
Be Above the Grammar School
Grades.
Acting Customs Collector Jackson re
ceived a dispatch yesterday from Secre
tary Gage dlnmisMng the appeal of Yip
Wah and giving a more than unusually
rigorous interpretation of the Chinese tx
ciusion act.
Yip came hither from China a few
months ago on a certificate as a student.
On being interrogated It was found ih^t
he did not possess even an elementary
ec vcation. He explained that he had come
to this country for the purpose of receiv
ing- an elementary education. His state
ment was not believed and he was ordere 1
deported.
In response to Yip's appeal Secretary
Gag<> replied that the word "students" i'i
the exclusion art did not apply to a Chi
nese person who. for instance, assumed
to be a student for the purpose of learn
ing to r?ad and write merely or to ctu ly
simple fractions cr any other of the ele
mentary branches. The word was to be
taken in its broad sense, and therefore
Yip was not a student and should be de
ported.
ILLEGAL CRAB-CATCHEBS
JAB.E TO BE PROSECUTED
Value of Shell Fish as a
State Product.
Chief Deputy Babcock Discusses the
It Is against the law to catch or have In
your possession a female crab. The State
Board of Fish Commissioners is enforcing
the law and offenders are being severely
prosecuted. A. Bartolomes was taken into
custody yesterday, and on Friday last An
tonio Espo, foreman of A. Paladini's
steam fishing boat, was arrested for hav
ing female crab in his possession.
"The necessity of enforcing this law,"
said Chief Deputy John P. Babcock, "Is
much more important than the public gen
erally appreciates*. There are at the pres
ent time thirty-three gasoline crab boats
carrving two men each who tish along the
beach from ten miles north cf the Heads
to six or eight miles south. These boats
are worth about $000 each, and the owners
fish on an average of live days a week the
year round. They catch about seven
dozen crabs a day. and some days make
a heavier catch. In addition to the gaso
line boats there are forty-nine sailboats
also engaged in this business. The latter
are valued at J75 each and are frequently
manned by two men. Their catch aver
ages four dozen per day.
"The figures for the full catch for 1S39
are Interesting. One hundred and eleven
thousand and twenty dozen crabs were
caught 'during that year. The average
weight Is about thirty pounds to the
dozen. The total weight was 3,330,600
pounds, which at 70 cents per dozen gives
a total value of 577 140. This Is an Increase
over the catch of 1S35. when the total
catch wa's valued at $61,760. The small
catch in that year was due to the fact
that there were no gasoline boats useo.
There is no doubt the crab is on the de
crease. This is due to the fact that gaso
line boats are used, and they are able to
cover more territory than the sail boats.
"Thus If is absolutely necessary that the
female crab should be left undisturbed.
The Board of Fish Commissioners intend
prosecuting every offender of the law, as
the fishery industry Is one of the most im
portant in the State." -hip.
" James Horton, alias Gray, alias Murray,
an ex-convict and all-around crook, was
arrested yesterday morning by Detectives
Wren and Dinan and locked up In the
tanks. He is supposed to be the burglar
who hes been operating with considerable
success" In the Western Addition during
the past week. In his room the detectives
found several pieces of jewelry and some
silver ware which are known to have been
stolen.
Horton first came under the eye of the
police about five years ago, when he waa
arrested in Oakland while in the act of
breaking into a house. He was convicted
after a 3hort trial and sent to Folsom.
On being discharged about a year ago he
came to this city and committed a series
of daring burglaries. Before the poilce
could arrest him he and another crook
named McCallum had a row over a divi
sion of spoils, which resulted in the latter
shooting Horton In the foot. McCallum
was ariesteu and stnt to .San Quentin lor
three years.
While in the hospital Horton was recog
nized as the pal of a noted counterfeiter,
who was beirg anxiously sought for by
the Secret Service officers. Horton's room
was located after considerable trouble,
and a complete counterfeiter's plant
found. Subsequently the confederate of
Horton, who proved to be an ex-convict
named Gray, was arrested while about to
leave the city. They were both charged
with having counterfeiters tools In their
possession, but were acquitted after sev
eral trials by a Jury in the United States
court.
A short time afterward Horton was dis
covered In the act of breaking Into a
house in the Western Addition, but
through some Influence he was released on
his promise to leave the city and never
return. After leaving here he went to
Sacramento and committed a number of
bold burglaries. He returned here about
two weeks ago and at once got back to his
old tricks. Â«
The detectives have sufficient evidence
rgainst him to land him in the peniten
tiary for a long period.

NOTED CROOK
CAUGHT WITH
HIS PLUNDER
George C. Perkins, United States Sen
ator, expects to leave Alameda County
this evening for Washington, D. C. Dur
ing the past week he has H&tened to
many delegations who have favorites to
recommend for the office of United States
District Attorney. The place, however,
will not be vacant until the resignation of
Frank L. Coombs, the Incumbent, Is ac
cepted. Mr. Coombs will enter upon his
duties as Representative in Congress from
the First California District on March 4,
1901.- Among those who are willing to
succeed him In the office of District At
torney are: Thomas L. Carothers, Mar
shall B. .Woodworth, State Senator J. J.
Boyce, General E. S.- Salomon and D. E.
McKinlay.
Senators Bard and Perkins will be In
Washington a day or two before Congress
convenes and will doubtless obtain the
views of the United States Attorney Gen
eral" regarding the appointment of Mr.
Coombs' successor.
Clem Perkins, who is slated for the po
sition of cashier of the custom-house, to
succeed W. B. Hamilton, Is not a son, but
a nephew of Senator Perkins. The Sen
ator has three sons, but the only one In
the Federal service is the youngest, who
gained appointment to the naval acad
emy by competitive examination, in which
forty applicants competed for the prize.
It is no secret that Senator Perkins Is a
candidate for re-election to the United
States Senate. His present term will ex
pire March 4, 1903. The Legislature to con
vene in January. 1903. will elect his suc
cessor unless another deadlock shall en
sue. The opponents of Senator Perkins
are spreading the rumor that he has en
tered into a bargain to retain In office
John C. Lynch, Collector of Internal Rev
enue. '
At the next session of Congress Califor
nia will be represented by a solid Repub
lican delegation. The members of -the
House will find on the calendar a bill
which has passed the Senate authorizing
an appropriation of $2,500,000 for building
a, new custom-house, in San Francisco.
Doubtless Representatives Loud, Kahn.
Metcalf, Needham, Coombs, Woods and
McLachlan will unite their efforts to se
cure early and favorable action on the
bill In the House. The fact that the city
gave President McKinley 10,000 plurality
will not handicap the Congressmen In
their efforts to obtain the needed allow
ance.

the Eve of His Departure

DUTY CALLS THE
SENIOR SENATOR
TO THE EAST
Wells Finds a Way
â¢ to Pay Creditors.
"When the merchant and school teacher
creditors of the city sign "paid" to their
warrants they will, or should, thank
Auditor Asa R. Wells for their being able
to do so. The Auditor after consultation
with his old and much tried friend, the
new charter, has evolved a way In which
bills against the city owed since 1S93 will
be paid. Reuben H. Lloyd may also be
thanked in the cause.
Now the charter In its entirety and de
tail is known to the Auditor as well as
his Bible, perhaps better. The question
of how to pay the teachers and merchants
whose hopes of seeing the city's money
had been on the point of dissolving into
a very blue beyond, has weighed on the
Auditor's mind for some time. He has
thought of many a plan, many a time,
but all had "gone agiey" until that use
ful instrument, the charter, offered Itself
as a stepping stone out of the difficulty.'
The cnarter states that ail money re
maining in the City Treasury at the end
of the fiscal -year -'after ail valid debts
have been liquidated shall be disbursed
among those (be they teachers, merchants
or what not) who have judgments against
the city. This provision applies with
equal torce to Judgments oDtained for
Indebtedness encountered before the
charter went into effect. Now the teach
ers and merchants, with patience which
approached near to being a virtue, have
waited for the distribution, long promised
and equally long delayed, among them of
a sum of $129,750 due from the city. Till
the Auditor and the charter stepped in
the money had looked like what insur
ance men call "a bad risk."
The close of the present fiscal year,
however, beheld in the City Treasury a
snug surplus Of $225,000 accumulated from
the Increased assessment.
It appeared to Auditor Wells that some
of this should be devoted to awarding the
Job-like patience of the teachers and
merchants. Attorney Lloyd gave the
matter careful consideration and came to
the same conclusion as the Auditor.
-Here is the way Attorney Lloyd sizes
up the matter: The surplus is open to
attack from any .creditor who had or
could secure judgment against the city.
The question of devoting some of the sur
plus to street repairs does not figure, as
the charter provides that outstanding
claims must be satisfied before the sur
plus can legally be devoted to any other
purpose. Now, what will have to be done
to get the money i3 for the creditors to
assign all their claims to one man, who
will sue the city and secure ludgment.
The surplus will pay everybody in full
and yet leave some thousands of dollars
for street Â¦ purposes. The sum due the
merchants is $8000/ while the teachers'
claims for November, 1898. salaries are
$25,750, and for December, 1898, $96,000. The
news that the Auditor has solved thi3
vexed question in a manner which seems
likely Â¦ to yield satisfaction and dollars to
everybody should, he thinks, make pleas
ant sauce for the teachers' Thanksgiving
birds,- and be a source of joy to every
citizen in that the municipal integrity of
San Francisco has been redeemed.

Judge Eahrs on the ground of Infidelity.
Mrs. Nolan's action was partly heard
some weeks ago, but Judge Bahrs was
doubtful a? to the corr*Â«ctness of her
charge. Additional testimony was taken
last week, however, and the decree has
beÂ«?n granted. The property rights of the
litigants, Â¦which are large, have been set

i Frederick Raa.!>e, the Democratic poli

party to a divorce suit filed yesterday by
Margaret Raabe. Mrs. Raabe was arrest
ed recently on complaint of her husband
<m a charge of insanity. After a hearing
before the Insanity Commission she was
discharged, it having been determined by
the commission that she was of sound
mind, "though 'the possessor of an un
povernabie temper." In 1SSQ Raabe sued
his wife for divorce. A reconciliation was
elected, however, and the case never
vent to trial. Mrs. Raabe filed a cross
complaint yesterday charging her hus
band with cruelty, and the ca?e will now
po to trial. It is said that Raabe will
make no answer to his wife's cross-com
plaint and that his -wife will obtain judg

ARE DOWN TO ISSUES
nr THE POTTEB, CASE
"Witnesses Testify as to the Services
Performed for Deceased by
Claimant.
The action Instituted by Mrs. Annie J.
Pronk against the estate of the late Jesse
C. Potter to recover for services rendered
as a nurse has been stripped of its sen
sational features, and the attorneys are
now reaching into the merits of the case.
Joseph Malfante, proprietor of Delmonl
co's; Dr. J. A. Xoble. who attended the
deceased; Charles W. Constley, his bar
ber; Charles Kelb and William La France,
waiters, and Mrs. Pronk, the claimant,
were the witnesses of the day.
Malfante and Dr. Noble testified as to
their knowledge of the services rendered
by Mrs. Pronk, both agreeing that she
was unusually attentive to the deceased
during his last illness and added much to
his comforts. Constley testified as to hav
ing received $10 a. shave from the deceased
on one cr two occasions, and was as sure
that Mrs. Pronk had been as generous in
her attentions to the deceased as he was
to the witness for his services. Kelb and
La France testified that they had served
meals at Potter's suite frequently, and al
ways found Mrs. Pronk In attendance.
Mrs. Pronk was the last witness of the
day. She testified as to her attendance
upon Potter, and gave to the Jury her
estimate of the value of her services.
When the claimant left the stand the
defense made a motion for a non-suit.
This was denied by Judge Daingerfield.
The defense will produce its witnesses to
day.
have fair play. I do knowthat.a number of
heads of departments are in favor of their
employes taking the examinations if they
could receive the examinations provided
for by the charter, but they object to hay
ing persons thrust upon them, who, while
they may be highly educated and pass the
scouting of the Civil Service Commission,
will be entirely incompetent to perform
the duties of the positions to which they
may be assigned.
"The Commissioners must not forget
that their bonds as public officials are
very small as compared with those of
other officers of the city government,
such as the County Clerk. Tax Collector.
Sheriff or Assessor. These officials are
responsible on their bonds for errors made
by Incompetent deputies and consequently
should have some consideration shown
them as to the employment of their dep
uties. It Is certainly unfair to thrust per
sons into their offices and compel them
to teach them their duties for an indefi
nite period. Indeed, I unlerstand that
threats have been .made that IT certain
officials do not do this the Mayor will be
appealed to to remove them from office.
Coercion by the Civil Service Commission
is no better, to my way of thinking, than
that of the political bosses. The princi
ple Is exactly the same In both cases.
"In conclusion, I desire to say that I do
not question the integrity of the commis
sion, but their power is so enormous for
good or evil under the charter as they
construe it .that I believe thev have lost
their heads.- In attempting to excuse
their actions' the statement has been
made that the fault lies with the system.
Such is not the case, however. . The merit
system provided for by the charter Is
like many other sections of the chartes,
all right; but the trouble has been with
the officials who have construed the pro
visions of the instrument to suit their
own ideas and whims.
"While the Supervisors have amend
ments of the charter under consideration,
I believe they could not utilize their time
to better advantage than by devising
some way by which this important arti
cle. If constitutional, can be carried out
as the people of this city expected and tho
freeholders intended it should be carried
out. .
"Under all tha circumstances of this
controversy I think the Civil Service
Commission should unite with the heads
of departments of the city government
and obtain an early decision as to the
constitutionality of the charter- articles,
as was done In the cases of Assessor
Dodge, who is suing for his poll tax com
mission; Treasurer Brooks, who Is suing
for his collateral Inheritance tax fees,
and the stenographers who resisted the
article fixing their salaries. In none of
these Instances was resistance made to
the decree of the courts, but courts and
officials Joined in an effort to settle the
law. v
"I regard the course row being pursued
by the commission as ill-advised and cal
culated to cause additional trouble. The
danger Is that a fight Involving partisan
politics will tend to degrade civil service
reform and deprive it of a fair trial before
the people.
"The statement has been made that I
am the attorney for Sheriff ' Lackmann.
This Is untrue."
Ex-Mayor L. R. Ellert has opened up
on the local Civil Service Commission
and . expresses opinions that are very
uncomplimentary to the m^n comprising
that board. Mr. Ellert says among other
things that the commission is meet
ing- with trouble because . the members
are inexperienced, use bad judgment and
refuse to accept' the advice of better in
formed people, able to post them on how
they should proceed.
Mayer Ellert says he Is an ardent advo
cate of civil service and that as a Free
holder his only fear was that the Mayor
would appoint to the Civil Service Board
theorists who would not carry out the
spirit of the charter. Ihcse fears have
been realized, the ex-Mayor declares.
Some politicians who are Interested in
the welfare of certain members of the
Phelan-Fay push, now holding jobs at the
City Hall, are criticizing Judge. Hebbards
recent decision and saying it was rendered
on political grounds as part of a plan to
break down the charter. There Is being
thrown into the f/ice of these persons the
decisions rendered by Judge Seawell, who
Is a Democrat, in the action instituted by
Assessor Douga. and Treasurer Brooks,
both Democrats', in regard to fees and the
euit of the shorthand reporters, also
brought by a Democrat, to have nullified
the clause in the charter providing that
reporters in the criminal Superior Courts
should receive but 5200 a month each as
fuil compensation and pay out of this the
cost of transcribing and stationery.
These decisions were the first blows
struck at the charter.
Dodge, If the Supreme Court sustains
Judge Seawell, will protit to the extent of
W.WJ during his four-year term, though
he pledged himself to the people to ac
cept no fees whatever should they elect
him Assessor. Brooks will profit largely
also.
Dodge's attorney, in the action wherein
he was awarded the fat pickings from
poll tax, was Gavin McNab, Democratic
leader. The matter was submitted on
briefs as agreed to by City Attorney Lane,
Democrat.
It Is said that Dodge tried very hard to
have the action regarding fees brought
Into court without his appearing as a
party and that a strong effort was made
to throw Brooks to the front in the mat
ter. The Treasurer had set aside the
amount of the poll-tax commissions at
Dodee's request and when affairs were
reaching a focus he told the Assessor
that if he did not do something pretty
quick the sum to set aside would be turned
into the general fund by the Treasurer.
Then the action was begun.
Ex-Mayor Ellert said yesterday:
"The troubles of the Civil Service Com
missioners, in my opinion, are due princi
pally to their inexperience and bad judg
ment as well as to the position they as
sume in beinsr unwilling: to accept advice
or suggestions from citizens, who, from
their experience, are competent to give
them advice. None of the gentlemen of
the commission. I believe, have had any
practical experience in municipal affairs,
and the very lack of that qualification has
led them into many errors. For instance,
the charter provides that the Commis
sioners shall make rules to carry out tha
purposes of the article on civil service,
Out it does not empower the Commission
ers to make changes in the rules to suit
individual cases without some reasonable
notice to the public, which they have
acne several times.
"The position the Commissioners assume
in their construction of the, law as set
forth in section 4, article 13, "that all ex
aminations shall be practical In their
character," Is very peculiar to say the
least. The recent examination for
police officers, for instance, was to my
mind a clear violation of the spirit of. tne
charter. A .good police officer should be
in perfect physical condition when he is
appointed; ne should also be intelligent
and have good judgment. But questions
should not be submitted to him that would
necessitate the education of a professional
man to answer correctly.
"Another instance was the examination
for the Tax Collector's office, which un
der the charter includes the license de
partment. In place ot providing for two
or more examinations to conform to the
law for this part- of .the municipal govern
ment, one examination only was given.
Nearly an the questions submitted applied
to the duties of the tax department, which
was unfair and unjust to the employes
or the license office, whose duties are en
tirely separate and distinct from those
of the tax department. The excuse of
the Commissioners for violating the law in
tnls case is, I believe, that it would be
impractical to do any different, which is
not a fact.
"The Commissioners also assume the
position, and a very unreasonable and un
businesslike one it Is, that the clerks in
any department should be competent to
do the work of any other clerk in the
same office. That contention is, of course,
simply absurd. As well assert that in a
large department store a clerk in the hat
department should be able to go into the
hardware department and be perfectly
familiar with the duties; that one In the
boot and s,noe department should be cap
able of performing the duties required or
one in the toy department. I hardly thlnR
If the principles advocated by the Civil
Service Commissioners were applied to a
large business house, that the business
would succeed for any length of jtlme.
"I have always been an ardent advocate
of civil service reform, and from my ex
perience in public life I realize the neces
sity of having some such system of ap
pointment. As one of the Freeholders I
took a very active interest in advocating
the article applying to civil service. The
only fear that I had was that the com
mission to be appointed by the Mayor
would be 'composed of theorists, who
would not carry out the spirit of the char
ter, and I regret to say that my fears
have been realized. I have kept in close
touch during the past few months with
the work of this Civil Service Commission,
and- it is my belief that the city govern
ment has been seriously demoralized by
their theoretical rulings. I believe to-day
that nine-tenths of the City Hall em
ployes would be more than willing to take
the examinations applying to their posi
tions if they thought they were going to
ELLERT SEVERELY ARRAIGNS
CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION
Declares His Fear That the Mayor Would Appoint a Weak
Board Has Been Realizedâ -Democrats Were the
First to Break Down Charter.
Supervisors to Order
S reets Improved.
The refusal of the Board of Public
Works to recommend the best pavement
for the downtown district In accordance
with the ideas of the Street Committee
will avail it but little. Supervisor Curtis
introduced a resolution at yesterday's
meeting of the board providing that as
the Eoard of Public Works objects to rec
ommending the paving of Washington.
Clay. Sacramento and Pine streets from
Montgomery to Sansome with asphalt on j
a six-inch concrete foundation the work |
be ordered done In accordance with the
power conferred upon the Board of Super- 1
visors by the charter.
Curtis explained that the Street Com
mittee had conferred with several reliable i
people as to what would be the best pave
ment for the streets named.
"We have talked with merchants and
te&msters," sa:d Curtis, "and we arrived
at the conclusion that an asphalt cover
ing on a concrete base is the test for all
conditions. The cobblestone foundation
will not make^a good pavement for heavy
traffic. That explains why we favored
such a foundation on Grant avenue, where
the traffic is light. It seems strange that I
the Board of Public Works should be so
insistent In its recommendation of such a !
foundation, which it acknowledges to be I
inferior. The Street Committee icels it to I
be its duty to disregard the recommenda
tion of the Board of Public Works and
on its own account asks that the best
pavement be ordered."
Reed called attention to the charter pro- !
vision requiring the written retommenda- i
tion of the Board of Public Works for all
street work, and held that there was no i
escape from it. Curtis, however, quoted
another section which provides that if
the Board of "Works refuses to recommend
any street work for which application has
been made the Supervisors can order the
improvement by an affirmative vote of
fourteen members. Reed desired to know
if such application was on file, and Edgar
Painter stated that' a general application
had been filed by the Merchants' Asso
ciation and the North Central Improve
ment Association for the repaving of
streets in the downtown district,
McCarthy moved to amend the ordi
nance by substituting for asphalt vitrified
brick or basalt blocks of the same size
grouted with asphalt, but the motion was
ruled out of order. The resolution was
then referred to the Street Committee for
immediate consideration.
The Tax Collector was authorized to em
ploy ten clerks to complete his annual set
tlement with the Auditor.
The Treasurer was authorized to em
ploy one additional clerk for two months.
The Auditor was empowered to employ
temporarily ten extra clerks.
The board adjourned to meet this even
ing to take up the water rate investiga
tion.
WILL IGNORE BOARD
OF PUBLIC WORKS
The futile efforts made in the fast Board
of Supervisors to secure a reduced car
fare for workingmen and school children
are to bÂ« revived by Supervisor Braun
hart. but with the workingmen left out.
Braunhart introduced an ordinance at
yesterday's meeting of the board provid
ing for a half-faro to be charged school
children going- to and from school,
braunhart is not dismayed by the fact
tnat an ordinance introduced by ex-Super
visor ilagulre providing for a half-fare
standing rate, which was introduced as
far back as last April, has been quietly
slumbering since- then In the Street Com
mittee, to which It was referred, and on
which no report has ever been made.
Bvlnsrton's ordinance, which was re
jected by the last board, provided that
thÂ£ street railway companies should be
required to sell seven tickets for 25 cents
to school children and eight tickets for
25 cents to workingmen. said tickets, hox^
ever, to be good only during certain spec'
fied hours of the day. Braunhart'3 ordi
nance Ignores the worklngmen and con
tains a clause making Its violation a mis
demeanor. The ordinance was referred
to the Judiciary Committee to determin*
its legality.
The Board of Public Work3 was direct
ed to enter Into a. contract for the con
struction of bunkers for street sweÂ«plnga
at an estimated cc3t of $5005. It la in
tended to make a specific appropriation
next year for the Park Commission to re
move the sweepings to Golden Gate Park.
The resolution condemning the Alia
Theater was deferred until the next meet
ing. The Board of Public Works is at
present Investigating the repairs neces
sary to be made in the building to maka
It safe.
The ordinance authorizing the Board of
Public Works to enter Into a contract for
cleaning and sweeping the public streets
irom January 1. 1901, to June 30, 1001. at
an estimated cost of $30,000, was laid over
for one week. McCarthy expressed a de
sire to see the specifications which aro
on file In the office of the Board of Public
Works.
The Police Commission was authorized
to employ a cook for the City Prison at a
salary of $60 per month.
The chief of the department of elec
tricity was directed to extend the electric
lighting system to the copyists' gallery
in the Hall of Records.
The roadway of McAllister street, be
tween Broderlck and Baker, paved with
bituminous roetc was fully accepted.
It was resolved that the printing and
furnishing of transcripts on appeal in
civil cases be done by competitive blddlne.
The City Attorney was authorized to

agent for sale.
The Tax Collector was authorized* to

persons who have paid the tax or who
were under age on March 1. 1300.

REDUCED FARE FOR
SCHOOL CHILDREN
The ordinance providing for the appro
priation of $100,000, in two installments of
$50,000 each, for the acquisition of land for
St. Mary's square was passed to print
yesterday by the Board of Supervisors,
after a motion to postpone it indefinitely
had been lost by the narrow margin of
one vote. The ordinance also provides for
the release of the $125,uuO originally appro
priated tor tne parK and now neid imact
in the city treasury pending the outcome
of litigation.
G. LÂ». bhaaburne, president of St. Mary"s
Square Association, made a strong appeal
tor tne appropriation.
"I feel sati-snea," said Shadburne, "that
if you assure us of $100,000 for the park
we will raise whatever more will be neces
sary by private subscriptions. The Police
.Department favors the establishment of
the park, as it will wipe out a veritable
plague spot. The ordinance. If adopted,
wilt release the Jli5,iwo now tied up, which
can be uriliied to i>ay creditors of the
city."
"1 den't believe a square- is necessary in
that localitj," said JlcCavthy. "I cannot
see how we can legally appropriate the
HoO.OOO asked for. Yne charter says that
any purchase of land in exctss of $50,000
must be suornitted tc a vote of the people.
1 thinK an ai-se^smc-nt should h.e made In
the oistnet which :& supposed to be bene
fited by the j:arK."
"I am in fa\or of parks," said Hctallng,
"but not too many in one district. I
would favor a park south of Market
street, for instance, for there children
.could romp and play, but they will not do
so in St. Mary's Park; even ;hough flow
ers may grow where sin has flourished.
1 move th^ Indefinite postponement of the
ordinance."
Brandenstein opposed the ordinance on
the ground that it conflicted with the
charter.
"Father Otis told me once, said Bran
denstein, "that the only reason a park was
wanted in the locality was on account of
the lack of police surveillance in the
haunts of vice. This Is a sad commentary
&n the etflclency of our Police Department
and certainly calls for some action."
Tobin favored the establishment of a
park, but contended that as the illegality
of the appropriation was obvious he would
vote against it.
ReecLurged the passage of the ord.'nance,
as It v.ould be keeping faith with the park
promoters and release the $125,000 to pay
an army of creditors of the city.
Hotaling's motion on indefinite postpone
ment of the ordinance was lost by the fol
lowing vote, ten votes being necessary to
carry:
Ayes â Brandenstein, D'Ancona, Hotal-
Ing. McCarthy, Stafford, Tobin.
Noesâ Booth, Boxton. Braunhart, Comte,
Connor, Curtis. Dwyer, Reed, Wilson.
The motion on passage to print of the
ordinance was carried by the following

FUNDS VOTED FOR
ST. MARY'S SQUARE
TT.e resolution authorizing the Mayor to
enter into a written contract with the
People's Mutual Telephone Company to
secure to the city the right and option tc
the company's franchise was referred to
the Judiciary Committee by the Board of
Supervisors yesterday. The City Attor
ney had filed an opinion that the proposi
tion would first have to be submitted to a
vote or the people before it could be en
tertained.
Reed thought the City Attorney's*opin
ion was not good law.
"We have jin option here which may be
tccuired for 51." eald Reed, "and by so
CoSng we make it possible for one tele
phone company to become a rival to an
other which makes Jl^OO.0 1 .") per year on a
franchise of 51,000.000. It will result in
cutting down the exorbitant prices
charged to its customers by the existing
telephone monopoly. We are not buying
a public utility, but only an option there
on; therefore it is not necessary to submit
the proposition to the people first."
Brandenstein agreed with the City At
torney, and thought that the sum of $1
for which the option could be bought was
Â£0 email that the city Bhould unquestion
ably acquire It. Braunhart thought that
the purchase of the option would revive
a franchise of the People's Mutual Com
pany which he regarded Â£5 having been
forfeited.
"We wtat new and rival companies to
come here to Insure competitive rates,"
put In ReÂ«d. "TbÂ« franchise Is perfectly
valid end the Issuance of bonds by the
People's Company to the amount of Jl,-
IOO.OjO Is absolutely certain."
McCarthy introduced a resolution which
Â¦was adopted under suspension of the
rules, in which the Auditor is requested
Â«LHd directed to inform the board whether
he has been and is now complying with
section 6 of chapter 2 of article IV of tha
charter, with reference to the Pacific Tel
ephone and Telegraph Company; and also
tiiat the Treasurer furnish the board with
a statement of the amounts of money
raid by him to the above named telephone
company since June last.
McCarthy explained that the clause re
ferred to provides that no demands shall
be allowed by the Auditor in favor of any
corporation cr person in any manner In
debted to the city and county except for
taxes not delinquent without first deduct
ing: tiie amount of any indebtedness of
which he has notice.
"There i? some $200,000 owing by the tel
ephone company to the city for bajk li
cence taxes on their nickel machines,"
said McCarthy, ""and I hold that the city
ehould not pay any bills of the telephone
company, but simply charge them up
against the money due the city. I dis
covered that the bills are being regularly
paid by the Auditor and Treasurer in the
face of a resolution adopted by this board
directing those officials not to pay them."
Board Urged to Pur
chase Its Franchise.

In considering this scheme it is to be borne in mind
that Chicago is also engaged in "an effort to bring
about the construction of a' deep waterway from the
lakes to the Atlantic through the" Erie canal or
through the St Lawrence. -^Should' both schemes be
successful Chicago would have an open waterway to
The gift, however, is to have a "string oh, it," as
the saying is. The canal is to be given only upon con
dition that the National Government convert it from
a drainage waterway to a ship canal of ample depth
and width to permit the passage from Chicago of
ships -of sufficient tonnage to engage in ocean . traffic
through the Nicaragua canal."
The discussion brings before the country a scheme
the enterprising people of Chicago have been medi
tating for a long time, and which it is now probable
they will urge upon Congress. The scheme has for
its beginning a notable act of liberality to the nation.
At a cost of about $33,000,000 Chicago has constructed
a drainage canal carrying the waters of Lake ; Michi
gan back to the Illinois River. Chicago now offers
to give that canal to the nation. It is to be a gift to
prove the national patriotism and liberality of. her
people, and the rest of the country is expected to re
ceive it with gratitude and admiration.

which the shipyards of the lakes would have an equal
advantage with those on the seacoast in building ships
for" ocean traffic. It was stated by one of the speakers
that the linking of the lake trade, the coast trade and
the ocean trade could be attained by the construction
of the Nicaragua canal and the further construction
of a deep and wide canal from the lakes to the Mis

PERSONAL MENTION.
It is of course not likely the American people are
worse than others in this respect, but it happens'we
have had a larger number of generous millionaires to
stimulate the craze for applying to them on-all'sort9
of petitions for coin; and so the evil is greater here
than elsewhere. Perhaps the publication of the ex
tent to which Miss Gould has been made a victim may
tend to check the beggars, and for that reason the
story merits a wide circulation.
It has been said that whenever a millionaire in this
country becomes noted for generosity men and
women from all parts of the Union take a special train
and start for his home. Of course this demand from
all sorts of persons and for all sorts of purposes im
poses a heavy burden upon the generous. Moreover
it tends to dishearten them in their work. To a
woman like Miss Gould receiving applications for coin
at a rate exceeding $1,506,000 a week it must seem as
if the whole American people were eager to "rake"
every private fortune in sight.
Upon that showing it. is clear that if. Miss Gould
should be responsive to all the requests 'made upon
her she would scatter the family fortune at "a rate ex
ceeding even that of Comte Boni de Castellane. It
would be more costly to meet the American demand

the single week to which the circular "refers Miss
Gould was asked to furnish' coin for church fairs, li
braries, trousseaus, air pillows for soldiers, steamship

is no lack of variety in the American demand, and
some of it is about as fanciful as anything that ever
took the fancy of the Castellanes.
A BUSINESS man in the city of New York is

EDIBLE NESTSâ Enquirer. Berkclty
Cal. j The edible blrdsnest la an Impor
tant "article of commerce between the
eastern islands and China, and of luxury
in China. They are the nest of several
species of swallow of the genus Colloca
lla. The best known of these birds the
Collocalia esculenta, is about four and a
half Inches in length, eleven inches in ex
panse of wing, dusky black above paJ e
ash color beneath. The nest Is shioed
like that of the common swallow and ad
here? to a rock, vast numbers being found
together, often in absolute conticuitv
The nests themselves are formed of srrass
seaweed fibers, small leaves, etc 'knd are
attached to the rock by a sort of bracket
made of a gelatinous substance, which is
really the part that Is eaten. This was
formerly thought to be made of seaweeds
but is now known .to consist of saliva'
which 'the swallow exudes from the saÂ«i
.vary.glapds under the tongue. The nests
are /collected by means of ladders and
often' by means of ropea, which enable
the gatherers to- descend from the sum
mit of a precipice like the rock fowlers
of. the north. -T.he gathering takes place
after the young-are fledgeoY, thrice In a
year. In the Chinese markets the nests
are rated at from $10 to $35 per pound ac
cording to quality, and they are of course
used only by the most wealthy, chiefly for
thickening rich soups. The nests weigh
about half an ounce each.

There is now every prospect that we are to be the
means of preserving the integrity of the Chinese em
pire, and of maintaining the open door for com
merce. The usefulness of our late election in all
these matters cannot be overestimated. It has as
sured the rest of the world that President McKinley
has the substantial backing of the whole country, and
that it will support his position to the last, even
though a show of national power be required to
demonstrate his ability to make good his position in
the Oriental question.
That we have won in the policy preliminary to the
final negotiation is a promise that our reasonable and
just views will prevail in the final settlement. We
have tccurcd one thing of great value in all such mat
ters, and that is time. It will soften the first asperi
ties that naturally had place when the Boxer out
rages were fresh, and will put all parties to the settle
ment in a better frame of mind.
Some of the European powers have desired to
throw right and reason to the winds. Remembering
the treaty forced out of China in i860 by France and
England, when China had been deprived of free
agency by their military power, many Europeans were
in favor of every exaction which power can force out
cf weakness. Having China in a position where she
could not offer resistance, they desired to take ad
vantage of her desperate condition. The United
States, however, has preferred to treat that empire
as we would any other under the same circumstances
of helplessness and misfortune, as having rights that
2re not extinguished by weakness.
All other matters will be deferred for negotiation
Â¦with China. This reasonable result is a distinct tri
umph for American diplomacy. Our Government has
not for a moment relaxed its position in favor of right
end reason as essential elements of a final settlement.
It appears now that these matters have been aban
doned as precedent to negotiations, and the powers
have united upon only such matters precedent as the
location of the legations in the capital, the space
around them required for their defense and for quar
ters for their defenders, the legation guards, and the
delimitation of the Chinese residence portion of the
city in its relation to the legation compounds.
IT is now reported that the foreign Ministers in Pe
king have reached an agreement on all matter*
preliminary to final negotiations with the represen
tatives of China. It should be remembered that some
cf the powers insisted upon several things precedent
to negotiations that were regarded by our Govern
ment as out of place. They should be put among the
negotiable issues, and not treated as non-negotiable
and precedent. Among these was the punishment of
important persons charged with giving official coun
tenance to the Boxer outbreak; the amount and
character cf indemnity to be paid by China; the per
sonnel of the Chinese Government and its location,
and destruction of the Ming tombs.

There is one broad difference between the case of
the Binghamton woman and that of Bryan. In the
woman's case there is a certain element of pathos
which will prevent unlimited hilarity, but in the
Bryanite case there is nothing beyond the ridiculous
pure and simple. With what eagerness did the astute
Democrats of 1806 hasten and hurry the work of
fusion. They tricked out Silver Republicanism and
Populism in garments so much like those of Democ
racy itself that none could tell one from another, and
they were delighted when their fusion brought about
in the public mind a hopeless confusion. For them
there can be no sympathy. They "mixed those babies
up," and now if they cannot tell one from another
the public don't care. It is a political farce of -big
proportions, and the laugh' is on the right side.
"The joke was a lovely one, but, as jokes sometimes
will, turned itself inside out into an alarming tragedy
when the mother discovered that the three babies,
which had been dressed alike for the hilarious occa
sion, had got their several identities inextricably en
tangled. Nobody could tell which from t'other, and
the denouement threw three- women and a nurse of
the usual comic opera intelligence into rapid
hysterics."
The story goes that a young wife in Binghamton,
who had just given birth to her first baby, thought
the occasion a good one to play a merry joke on her
husband; and accordingly she borrowed two other
new babies, placed them with her own, and on her
husband's return home presented him with the triplets.
The report continues:
REPENTANT Democrats who, after gayly plan
ning a fusion of Democracy, Populism and Sil
ver Republicanism, are now trying to get their
party separated from the mixture and straightened
out,- can perhaps find some comfort in a story from
Binghamton, New York, of a case in private life
having a misery parallel to their own. It is anothc
warnirrg of the folly of mixing things for the purpose
of practical joking, and since misery loves company
it may please the Democrats to hear of it. <r ''Â¦*'*-'Â¦ Â¦;'Â¦Â¦<

UTTERANCE
IN VARIETY
As for the army, Senator Jones is to be firm "in
opposing its use in strikes and labor troubles, and
will therefore oppose any increase in its size, except
for use abroad. No one has ever asked an increase
of the army for use in strikes and labor troubles. Tha
law says for what the army may be used, and henv.
Its use in domestic disorders has been twice found
necessary, and neither time by the Republican party.
For its- use in the strike of 1894 we beg to refer Mr.
Jones to his fellow Bryanite, Hon. Rkhard Olney of
Massachusetts, and for its presence in Idaho, at
Wardner, to the Populist Governor of that State,
Hon. Frank Steunenberg.
With characteristic inability to see an improper
analogy, the Bryan leader links the revival of our mer
chant marine, to be general in its nature, with the line
subsidy formerly given to the steamers of the Pacific
Mail and the Collins Company. What is needed now
i= encouragement of American ship-building by
American labor in American shipyards, just as the
Government aided and encouraged the construction
of our important American railway lines, to give to
Arkansas and the whole "Union its matchless system
of inland and overland transportation.
As a practical scheme this has had no equal since
the man sat on a limb and killed himself by sawing
it off between himself and the tree. If our merchant
marine were "able to take care of itself," as Senator
Jones asserts, why has it fallen so low since 1861?
Why is it now in deep water tonnage about where
it was 100 years ago? If it is able to take care of it
self, why does not Arkansas capital move to the sea
board and build ships? Why do not the maritime
States of the South Atlantic coast and the Gulf, in
the section represented by Senator Jones, proceed to
build and sail ships? The opportunity to take care
of themselves in that respect is open to every South
ern seaport from the capes of Delaware to the Rio
Grande. Why don't they do it? Why does the Gov
ernor of Georgia proclaim that Southern cotton finds
no American bottoms in his own great harbor of
Savannah to transport it to its foreign market? *
Upon this subject the Senator proposes to be ve
hement. Jones is impressive in his calmer moods,
but when he rises to vehemence the spectacle is ap
palling. He files notice of vehemence in opposing
the Hay-Paunccfote treaty. That treaty is made
necessary by the existence of the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty. Mr. Jones, who is opposed to an increase in
the army and to expenditures for the navy, with; a
mole-eyedness that is characteristic, proposes that we
shall build, own, fortify and garrison the canal. This
of course includes the fortifying and garrisoning of
the shores of Lake Nicaragua. ' As to the measure to
re-create our merchant marine, the Senator proposes
to be "vigorous" in opposition. He declares that ou:
shipping interests should take care of themselves. He
is not impressed by the fact that Japan is our equal
on the Pacific in merchant tonnage. His policy is to
have the United States build, own, fortify and garri
son the canal for- the use of foreign merchant ships.
He does not care that only 9 per cent of our deep
water commerce is carried under our own flag. He.,
wants to invest hundreds of millions in building the
canal, and other hundreds of millions uselessly in
protecting it, as a highway for the ships of cither na
tions carrying our commerce! Then, in the event of
war, the canal will be closed to our trade because we
have no ships of our own to carry it!
Within a foreign jurisdiction, in an alien state,
Nicaragua Lake will be a part of the can.il. Will M".
Jones have us own and control that large body of
water? The only ownership and control must re
late to its shores. We cannot embark in the owner
ship of a large water property that has no banks, no
shores, under our control. Will Nicaragua consent to
our ownership of the lake, and will she and Costa
Rica consent to be cut in two by the canal, and be
divided by a strip of the United States laid across
them?
As was to be expected, it ii a policy of mere oppo
sition. The party indicates no policy of its own. It
will merely oppose whatever the Republicans propose.
Pretending opposition to Imperialism, Senator Jones
pioposes to erect an empire within a foreign state by
asserting sovereignty over the isthmian We de
sire to know whether the constitution will follow the
flag in that case? He wants the canal and all its works
under the flag. Will the people there, necessary to
the operation of the car.al, be permitted consent of the
governed? Will they be- erected into a Territory?
Will they have a delegate in Congress?
SENATOR JONES, the Jnfallible Forecaster
General of the Bryan Democracy, is again in
evidence with a programme for the coming
session of Congress. ' Â¦
AN OPPOSITION POLICY.
The reports of the discussion at the Commercial
Club banquet were too brief to give us any clear un
derstanding of the arguments by which the two
measures were linked together. If the Chicago men
deem the Frye bill to be adverse to their interests they
are mistaken. At the present time the lake tonnage
and the ocean tonnage of the country are separated by
natural obstacles., and it would be folly to postpone
building up our ocean marine until we can "link" the
ocean and the lakes. Chicago should support the up
building of our ocean marine now, and if it be found
feasible later on to furnish her with an open water
way to both the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico, the
project will be considered on its merits.
both the Atlantic and the gulf, and would hold a poti
tion unrivaled in thÂ« country.
Great plans of that kind are attractive to the Ameri
can people, and Chicago will lose nothing in prestige
by making vigorous effort* to carry them out. There
is no apparent reason, however, why either of them
should be made a part of the merchant marine bill, or
why the Chicago people should antagonize the bill
because it does not directly give aid to the Chicago
scheme.

POLICE RAID FARO GAME
IN BURLINGTON HOUSE
Five Men Are Arrested and a Com
plete Layout Is Secured as
Evidence.
The police, as well as other people, have
been aware of the fact for some time that
faro games were being played in the city
and every effort has been made to locate
the place where the pastime of "bucking
the tiger" was indulged in.
Sunday morning Captain Seymour was
notified that a game was going on in room
14 at the Burlington House, 6ua Market
street, and he detailed Detectives Dillon,
Crockett and'Coleman to watch the place
and make a raid if they found that the
information was correct. The place was
carefully watched all Sunday, but theru
was no evidence to warrant a raid.
Yesterday morning a young policeman
was sent to room 14 and the three detec
tives quietly followed him. After he had
entered the detectives knocked for admit
tance, but it waa refused. They began to
force open the door wncn it was unlocked
and they entered. They found Frank
McDonald, a brother of Todd McDonald,
the well-known gambler, seated at a faro
table with a complete layout in front of
him, including "phony" rolls of bills. Mc-
Donald was arrested for conducting the
game and Ed Brooks, C. J. Stetson. Frank
Loud and Charles Davis were arrested as
visitors. McDonald had $535 in his pocket
when searched at the City Prison and he
put up $100 ball for himself and $20 for
each of the other four. The layout was
booked as evidence against them. The
table folded up and was- contained in a
valise specially made for the purpose.
LACKMANN HAS
NO PREJUDICE
AGAINST MELONE
Sheriff Declares He Drew a
Venire at Request of
Judge Seawell.
The opening gun in the suit brought by
ex-Judge William T. Wallace against
Drury Melone,to recover nearly $10,000 for
services rendered as attorney was fired
in Judge Seawell's court yesterday morn
ing, and the report of the initial proceed
ings reverberated down the corridors of
1 the City Hall and made interesting gossip
for those employed within the shadow of
the imposing dome. |
The case had been set for trial yester
day, but owing to the court h.aving a case
before it, the hearing was postponed until
Friday. The lirst meeting of the parties
interested was amusing to the spectators
who crowded the courtroom. \ James G.
Maguire, attorney for Melone, placed
bheriff Lackmann on the witness stand tor
the purpose of showing that the Sheriff
was prejudiced against his client. Betore
he finished interrogating his witness, how
: ever, he withdrew his charge and ad
mitted that he had been rnlolntormed.
It appears that Judge Sea well appre
ciated the Importance of the case, and he
ordered a special venire to issue. He sent
for Sheriff LacKmann and asked that ottl
cial to attend to the matter personally.
He also directed the Sheriff to secure tho
best men in the city and not to report the
names to the court until the morning of
the trial, lie further cautioned the bner
lft not to inform any one as to those se
lected by him to appear in court.
Counsel for the defendant were not
aware of the care taken Dy Judge Seawell,
and they entered the courtroom ready to
ask that the venire be set aside upon the
ground that the Sheriff was biased and
prejudiced against Meione. When the
case was called Judge Maguire stated his
motion, and E. S. Pilisbury, attorney for
Judge Wallace, said he had no objection
to tne examination of Lackmann. lie even
went so far as to say that if the Sheriff
had bias or prejudice in the matter he
wanted the jury excused. Â¦
SnerirT Lackmann was interrogated at
length by Judge Maguire. The latter
asked the witness whether he had' con
sulted anybody about the jury, and/ the
Sheriff said he had not. He stated that
he had attended personally to securing
the venire. Melone's counsel then asked
the Sheriff whether he had shown the
names to anybody, and again the witness
replied in the negative. Sheriff Lackmann
then told how Judge Seawell had sent for
him and requested him to attend to the
matter personally and select the best men
he could find In the city, and he had car
ried out the court's Instructions to the
letter.
Judge Maguire next asked Sheriff Lack
mann whether he was acquainted with
Judge Wallace. He said he was not; he
only knew of him as a Judge of the Su
perior Court. The witness was then
asked whether he had any partiality for
Judge Wallace, and again the witness
answered in the negative. He also said
he had never served as a Juror in Judge
Wallace's court.
"Well," said Maguire, "have you ever
had any particular relations with Judge
Wallace?"
"The only thing T can think of." replied
Lackmann, "was the time he ousted the
Board of Supervisors of which I was a
member." The quiet reply created much
merriment, and Maguire decided not to
interrogate the witness any further.. He
gracefully acknowledged that he had been
misinformed, and Lackmann withdrew.
Judge Sea well then denied the motion
to quash the venire, and set the case for
Friday morning. The testimony in the
case is exuected to be sensational. The
amount in dispute is alleged to be due
Judge Wallace for legal services rendered
many years ago in various contests fol
lowing the Issuance of a series of interest
bearing bonds for the city of Placerville
Melone is defended by Judge Maguire and"
Henry S. Dibble. They deny the alleged
indebtedness, and set uj> a counter claim
of nearly $60,000. The "defendant's attor
neys purpose showing that this sum was
npent at the direction of the plaintifT for
the purpose of obtaining the approval of
the bond issue by tho Legislature.
Cape Nome and the trials and tribula
tions of its miners again occupied the at
tention yesterday of United States Com
mig&ioner Heacock and opposing attor
neys. The only witness of the day was S.
C. Houghton, who related in detail the
tangled legal history of the Topkok mine,
one of the rich properties over which
Alexander McKerlzle obtained control by
favor of Judge Noyes. The story told by
Mr. Houghton showed how fictitious
claims were brought into court and with
out justification were recognized.
Receivers were appointed under absurd
ly small bonds, macninery was shipped to
the mine and gold was, taken out as
quickly as possible. The plan of opera
tions differed in no essential respect from
that adopted in conntction with other
mines.
S. C. Houghton reviewed the history,
troubles ana litigation of the Topkok
mine anterior to the arrival of Judge
Noyes. The witness outlined the various
alleged attempts ot- depredators to rob the
mine, operating upon it even after orders
had been given to suspend ail mining and
troops hau been stationed upon it 10 en
lorc-tt the command. All ot these facts
were objected, to Dy Geary, as tney haa no
bearing on juage Noyes, who nau not
yet arrived in isome. Hougnton replied
that he believed that direct application
would be snown. He tnerefore declared
that one of tne jurors wno had aeciUed
against the lopkoK mine was a stiiiuon-
Keeper and was appointed foreman ot tue
urund jury by Juuge Xsoyes.
Tnen came the active participation of
Juage Noyes and tne beginning ot the le
gal fight for the appointment of a re
ceiver. Several men made demand of the
court for possession or tne mine and the
appointment ol a itceiver. Houghton ue
ciared that these men had absolutely no
ngnt to their claims, 'iney were aÂ«pr*
autors, rpbDers and perjurers, he said. The
MopkoK people nieu tneir answer, Dut
juuge Isoyea appointed a receiver, thus
declaring that tne piamtiffs in tne case
possessed a strong probability of winning
the suit.
In reciting the Incidents Mr. Hougnton
gave very detailed reasons for his oellef
mat Judge Noyes had made a grievous
error. But William ti. Cameron was ap
pointed receiver, the date of the order be
ing August 8. "1 have very reliable in
formation," said Mr. Houghton, "that Mc-
Kenzle asked Mr. Mclntyre to act under
McKenzie as receiver. Mclntyre refused
and McKenzie then asked Attorney Griltln
to accept the' position. Grittln also de
clined." '- ' Â¦ .-â¢-â¢. Â¦/Â¦ '-
Houghton then produced a stenographic
report . of a conversation which he had
held with Griffln in reference to the
efforts made by Alexander McKenzie to
induce Griffin to accept the minor position.
This conversation lett no doubt thit Mc-
Kenzie was on terms of the greatest inti
macy with Noyes. When Receiver Came
ron was appointed he set to work to ex
tract from the mine the largest amount
of gold in the smallest amount of time.
This is one of the most serious allega
tions which has been made in connection
with the .appointment of receiverships for
the various claims.
The case will be resumed this morning
at 10 o'clock. ' .-''Â¦- Â¦- ; v

The Southern Pacflic Wants
I to Compete With the
Clipper Ship3.
The Southern Pacific will attempt to
compete with the clipper ships that
handle coke and cast Iron pipe. Hereto
fore none of the railroads have catered
to this particular commodity and the re
sult is that the Atlantic seaboard has
profited to.no small extent. By cutting
rates the Southern Pacific hopes to be
able to draw away at least a part of the
freightage which is now handled almost
exclusively by clippers.
Beginning about the 15th of December a
new rate will go into effect. In place of
the commodity rate for coke, which was
$11 per ton of 2000 pounds from the Mis
sissippi River, a special rate of $10 50 per
ton has been fixed from all points In the
Pocahontas district, West Virginia, to
California terminals, such as San Fran
cisco, Sacramento, StpcKton and Los An-
From the New River district to the
same points in California a similar rate
or $10 60 has been Iixed, while from the
Durham, Ga., district to the same points
in this State a special rate of I'J 20 per ton
has been fixed.
The blanket rate of seventy-five cents
per 100 pounds, or $15 per ton, for cast
iron pine from Chicago to California term
inals has been annulled and instead a
special rate for certain districts has been
adopted. From St. Louis, Memphis and
New Orleans, Birmingham, Gate City,
the Platt mines and other Eastern points
the new rate is sixty cents per 100 pounds.
From the New York pier via the Gulf
routes a rate of fifty cents per 100 pounds
has been nxed, which is a cut of twenty
live cents, while from Pueblo, Colo.,
thirty-seven cents and a small fraction is
charged, instead of fifty-six cents.
Manager Sproule says the cuts are not
brought about by any special condition
or rivalry v.lth any particular water line.
The railroad simply wants to get a share
of the Iron 'and coke freight traffic and

XIII. HOW TO AVOID COMMON
In the Use of Nouns.
It will be convenient in our discussion
to group common grammatical blunders
under the various parts of speech.
Nouns are words used as names. The
first practical thing to be noted about
them is that in the usage of good writers
some nouns begin with capital letters
while others do not. This distinction in
practice is based upon the classification
of nouns as common and proper.
A common noun is a name common or
applicable to all objects of the sameklnd
â aa house, boat, book, river, kln&aom.
Common nouns, when written, begin with
small letters. A proper noun Is the name
of some particular object, to distinguish
that object from others of its kindâ as
Gray Gables, Oceanic, Bible. Nile, Spain.
Proper nouns, when written, always be
gin with capital letters, so also do worda
derived from themâ as America. Ameri
can. Americanism.
The next practical observation to bo
made about nouns relates to the subject
of gender. Gender is a classification of
nouns according to the sex of the objects
for which they stand, a word denoting a
male object being of the masculine gen
der, a word denoting a female object be
ing of the feminine Render. In most cases
gender in our use of language may be
said to take care of itself, most mascu
line nouns being unconsciously referred
to by "he," "his" or "him": feminine
nouns by "she," "hÂ»rs" or "her." In the
cpse of a few nouns, however, blunders
are frequent; therefore we give a list of
words of different genders that are some
times confounded or otherwise misused:
Masculine. Feminine,
abbot - abbess
actor actress
administrator administratrix
adventurer adventuress
bachelor spinster, maid
buck doe (fallow Jeer)
bullock heifer
czar czarina
. drake â¢ duck
duxe ducnf>ss
earl countess
executor executrix
Francis Frances
gander goose
god â¢ goddess
heir heiress . â¢
hero , heroine
host â¢ hostess
Idolator ldoiatres*
Jew Jewess
lion lioness
marquis marcnioness
monk nun
prophet propnetess
stag, hart hind (red deer)
sultan sultana,
tiger tigress
waiter waitress
wizard witch
The next practical subject relating to
the correct use of nouns Is number. Num
ber is a difference in the form of a word
to distinguish objects as one or more
than one. The form of a word that de
notes one object la called the singular
number. Tne form of -a word that de
notes more than one object is called the
plural number. Number has an Import
ant practical bearing on the use of pro
nouns, verbs and the words "this,"
"these," "that" and "those." At present,
however, we confine ourselves to the
question of how the plural form of a
noun is made from the singular. The gen
eral rule, based on the practice of the best
writers, may be stated as follows: In
modern English most nouns form the
! plural by adding "s" to the singular. The
following variations from this reguiar
rule are important:
1. When the added sound of "s" makes
an additional syllable "es" is used: as.
I box, boxes; church, churches.
i 2. Nouns ending In "o." If the final "o"
I is preceded by a vowel the plural is
j formed regularly. 1. e.. by addina; "s": a>.
cameo, cameos. If the final "o ' is pre
ceded by a consonant, the tendency of
modern usage is to form the plural by
adding "es": as. hero, heroes; potato, po
! tatoes. The following common words.
j however, seem still to form the plural by
j adding "s" alone:
canto memento solo
duodecimo octavo Btiletto
halo piano torso
junto proviso tyro
lastto fiuarto
3. Nouns ending in "y." If the "y" is
preceded by a vowel the plural Is reg
ular: as, valley, valleys.
If the "y" Is preceded by a consonant.
"v" Is changed to "i" and "es" Is added
to form the plural: as. lady; ladles; city.
' cities.
: ?. Plural of nouns ending In "f." The
following nouns ending with the sound
of "f" change "f" or "fe" to "v" ana add
"es":
beef elf knife life self shelf wtfe
calf half leaf loaf sheaf thief wolf
5. Plural of proper nouns. Proper nouns
when made plural are not changed inter
nally: as, Henry. Henrys 1 : Nero, Neros.
Proper names" preceded by titles, as
"Mr. Smith," "Miss Smith." "Colonel
Smith." are treated in two different ways.
We say "the Mr. Smiths," "the Mrs.
Smiths," "the Miss Smiths," "the Colo
nel Smiths"; but we also say" the Messrs.
Smith." "the Misses Smith" and "the
Colonels Smith." * â¢'-' - ...
6. Plural of compound nouns. Most com
pound nouns form the plural by adding
the proper sign of the plural to the fun
damental part of the wordâ 1. e.. to the
part which is described by the rest of the
phrase; as, ox-cart, ox-carts: court-mar
tial, courts-martial; aid-de-camp, aids-de
camp. When no single word is fundamen
tal o .s in "forget-me-not." the sign of the
plural is put at the end: as forget-me-nots.
Words like "spoonful." the compound na
ture of which has been almost forgotten,
also take the sign of the plural at the
end: as. spoonfuls, cupfuls. "Man-serv
ant." "woman-servant" and "Knight
Templar" often and the. plural sign to both
words: as, men-servants.
Caution â "Brahman," "Mussulman."
"Ottoman" and "talisman" are not com
pounds of "man." They resemble "Ger
man" and "Norman." and form the plural
by adding "s." as Mussulmans.
7. Letters, figures and other symbols are
made plural by adding an apostrophe and
"s" Cs): as. "There are more e's than
a's in this word"; "Dot your l's and cross
your t's."
8. Some nouns have two plurals which
differ in meaning:
brother brothers (by birth), brethren (of a
( society).
die dies (for coining or stamping), dice
(for ?lay).
fish fishes (separate fish), flsh (collective).
Index indexes tin books). Indices (in alge
bia).
penny pennies (separate coins), pence (sum
of money).
shot shots, (discharges), shot (balls).
6taff sta\es (Doles), staffs (bodies of as
sistants).
9. Some nouns of foreign origin In com
mon use have peculiar number forma:
Singularâ Pluralâ
alumnus (masculine) alumni
alumna (feminine) , alumnae
analyris â¢ anal;-*es
anlmalculum anlmalcula
antithesis antitheses
I bacterium bacteria
beau â¢ beaux (or beaus)
cherub cherubim lor cherubs)
crisis crises
curriculum curricula
datum . â¢ data
genus (meaning "class" renera
I geniuses (persons of
great ability)
genii (spirit*)
hypothesis hypothese*
oasis oases
parenthesis parentheses
rhenomenon phenomena
eerarh seraphim (or seraphs)
stratum strata
tableau tableaux
thesis theies
One of the most common blunders con
nected with the use of nouns Is the Incor
rect writing of 'what i3 called the posses
sive case â l. e.; that form of noun that de
notes possession: as, "This is Harry's
ball." The practice of the best writers Is
as. follows: In the singular numbor the
possessive noun is formed, as a rule.. by
adding an apostrophe and "Â»" ('Â«); as.
,'The boy's coat." Often the pronunciation
of the added "b" makes a new syllable. If
this additional syllable makes an unpleas
ant sound the "s" is omitted, but the
apostrophe Is retained: as. "For goodness*
sake." If the "a" is sounded, it is always
written; and if it is written, It should be
pronounced In reading. The putting in ci
the leaving out of the "s" In such cases
is chiefly a matter of taste. Whenever
thÂ«ra is doubt It is well to add the "a": aa.
HOW TO DO DOUBLE ENTRY.
"Horace's odes," "Charles's bajl.'* *TMcStÂ«
ens's 'David Copperfield.' "
In the plural number, when the plural
already ends In "s" (as It usually does),
the possessive case Is formed by addln?
an apostrophe alono ('): as. "Boys' shoea.
The possessive of those few nouns whosa
pluxal does not end in "s" Is formed, as
in the singular number, by adding aa
apostrophe and "a" ('Â»): as, "Men'a
shoes." â¢
The possessive case of compound noens
and expressions used as compound nound
is formed by adding the proper sign of thÂ«
possessive to the end of the compound:
as^ "That Is my sister-in-law's pony.";
"This is the Prince of "Wales's palace. -
"When two or more persons possess a
thing In common, the sign of the posses
sive is attached to the last name) enly : as,
"John and Mary's home."
Separate ownership is indicated by a&S-
Insr the sign of the possessive to each
name: as. "Alice's and Jessie's dressos."
In forming the possessive of "anybody
else" and "who else" usage is divided and
inconsistent. The weight of jrood usago
seems to incline to "anybody else's"; but.
on the other hand, we usually say "whoso
else."
It Is sometimes a question whether to
use the possessive case or a phrase be
ginning with 'oV'âl. e.. whether to say
"Arnold's treason" or "the treason of Ar
nold." The tendency of the best modern
usage is to confine the possessive case to
nouns denoting living beings, and with
tnem to use it only in instances of actual
or Imagined possession, as "Arnold's
sword," "the treason of Arnold." Yet
some short phrases, like "a week's
wages," "a day's march." "a dollar's
worth," "at death's door," "for pity's
sake." are supported by the best usage.
With pronouns still greater latitude Is al
lowed. No one hesitates to write "on
vour account,"* "in my absence," "to their
credit," "for my sake," "In his defense."

account which we shall call hills payable. This
account Is credited with $S7S 40 and Miller' s
account U debited with the same amount. If
we had given Miller cash we would have cred
ited cash and charged him: we charge him Just
the same, but instead of crediting cash wÂ«
credit bills payable. Millar's account balances,
and the beginner may ask why we opened It
at all when he hold? a note against us for thÂ»
full amount. Schools with no knowledge of
business affairs teach to omit Miller's account.
This must not h-c done, for the bookkeeping
that does net give a complete history of the
transaction Is very poor bookkeeping. As a
matter of fact. Millar's account U- fully paid
up. but we have paid it. not In cash, but by
creating another liability which Js out against
us and which Miller may sell at his pleasure.
We had a transaction in Lesson So. X. la
which a receipt was given for borrowed money.
Now. a receipt differs from a note In th!s par
ticular: It Is not negotiableâ that Is. not
transferable. A receipt cannot be bought or
sold, and hence Is never either a resource or a
liability.

and the only purpose In making the entries la
to show the complete hlst.iry of the transac

Found Dead in a
Water Front Lodg

A STRANGER about whose Identity
there appears to be some my*
tery committed suicide yesterday
morning in the Dewey Houso.
S2 East street, by shooting him
self through the head with a 32-callber
revolver.
The stranger went to the lodging-house
last Sunday night and took a room, giv
ing his name as K. Walsh. After he re
tired nothing more was seen of him until
2 o'clock yesterday afternoon, when a
bed-maker named Parker looked through
the keyhole and saw him lying on the bed
with his face and head covered. %lth
blood. The door was forced open and th<Â»
stranger was found alive but unconscious,
with a revolver by his side. He had shot
himself back of the right ear. The Har
bor Hospital ambulance was sent for, but
the man died before the hospital was
reached.
The suicide wore a new suit of clothes,
and looked like a Cuban or a man of
Spanish extraction. There were found In
his pockets three Spanish coins, one, a
silver five peseta piece of 1892, another a
two rcalcs piece and the third a silver
coin dated 1792. The revolver was a
email-sized weapon with a white bone
handle, and of Spanish manufacture.
There were found also a check and pro
gramme for the Orpheum of November 20
and a ticket of the Cafe Roval "Social
Club," "Good for one drink, sandwich or
cigar." On the left forearm of the dead
man were tattooed the Initials "J. W."
He was ebout thirty years old.

course of tvtoea was by no means determined
at once. Bear traders operated on the short

after the opening. They made the argument

discovered they had a email following this
morning. There were rumors flying about the
board that prominent bear operators of last
week had been taking up long stock again.
Notable strength In particular stocks, accom
panied by ixinors of change of cytrol, helped
the market, and the bears were anally driven
to cover. While the strength In the market
was renewed, there was by no means the large
volume of buelnefts which has been the average
tor over two weeks past. Bear manipulation
was evident not only here but In foreign mar
kets. A settlement was In progress on the
London Exchange and In Berlin; but rumors
of the Czar's death, of threatened complica

KTOWlng out of the Kruger demonstration In
France did not aid the bears much In forcing
lower prices. London was a large buyer In
this market, fales at that account being esti
mated at 20.030 Bhares. Southern Railway
Btocks were In Fpeoial demand. Many rumors
Â¦were current of developments In the company.
Including an alleged lease to the Pennsylvania
and a coming increase of dividend i No au
thoritative tanctlon could bo had for any of
these rumors. The common and preferred
stocks advanced an extreme 3 points each.
Strength was radiated first to the Southern
group and then to the Southwestern, and in
some striking gains were recorded. Both the
preferred stocks, on which dividends are paid
or are earned, and* the low-priced common
stocks, for which dividend prospects are re
mot* at the beet, were affected alike. The
weekly earning* reported to-day on some of
the** systems showed sharp decreases from
lart year's corresponding period, notably in
Missouri Pacific and Denver and Rio Grande.
Nevertheless these stocks held a prominent
place in the advance. Gains In the group ran
from 1 to nearly 3 points. The more North
erly Grangers came Into the movement, es
pecially/ Burlington, but did â¢ not -show siich
marked etrenrth. The leading Fpecialtles were

The local tractions showed a. -rood recovery,

lips, who is credited with being In secure
control, was placid. Of the Ell cars received
to-day but lifty-one graded contract and private
elevators delivered to public houses over Sun
day only 60,000 bushels. These facts, together
with the sustalnins by the committee of Mr
Phillips' rejection of two cargoes of "doc
tored" corn, were responsible for the young
corn king's confidence and the agitation among
shorts. At 50 cents, Phillips let out Co 000
bushels. Between 49 and 50 cents he is credit
ed with liquidating 100,000 bushels. He pur
chased that much early, and possibly more

Webster intends having a biographical
Fketch of Sullivan published to refute re
ports adverse to him.
This was seconded by Trustee Turner
who Is for the antl-saioon ordinance but
who made no speech. When it came' to a
vote, Staats. Dowd and Hoft voted
against postponement and Turner and
Frame for it. President Marston said
that he wanted everybody to have a
chance and voted with Turner and Frame
Trustee Le Conte'was absent and the vote
being a tte on everything, all motions
were lost and. the matter went over until
two weeks from to-night, when the flgnt
will be .resumed. If Marston maintains
his position the anti-saloon ordinance will
be killed.
to express their opinions and speeches
were made by O. G. May, J. S. Crew
Ralph Fisher, president of the Associated
Students: John Eshleman, also of the uni
versity; J. W. Richards, former president
of the Town .Trustees; E. C. Arnold and
T. S. Brady. The only man who said any
thing for- tho naloons was N. L. -Nielsen
who asked Fisher what right university
students who were not .citizens- of the
town had to dictate what should be done
in regard to saloons. .
O. G. May, who was the spokesman for
the temperance people, made a plea for
two weeks* time to show what could bo
done toward enforcement, and Trustee
Frame moved that the matter be post
poned for two weeks.
Chief Justice Beatty rendered an ex
haustive opinion on the subject. It was
co:ici'ired in by Justices Van Dyke. Uar
routte and McFarland. The latter wrote a
rpecial opinion. The court held that i in
any possible view of the law the office of
Justice of the Peace for the town Â«' of
It appears that the town of Berkeley
was of the fifth class and the citizens
wanted a Justice's court, but the case of
Minor against the Justice's court knocked
it out. The Legislature In 1893 parsed a
special act permitting a city or town" to
t.'ike a special census of inhabitants id de
termine Us class for the purpose of hav-*
ing a Justice's court. In accordance with
thul act, a census was taken and It de
veloped that the population had Increased
to such a degree that the town was in the
fomth class and was entitled to a Jus
tice's court. Under the general munici
pality act, the Board of Supervisors ap
pointed Robert Edgar Justice of tho
Peace. The Board of Trustees of Berko
ley then passed an ordinance making it a
misdemeanor for any one to dispose of
malt or spirituous liqucrs within the town
ship. Fedderwltz and a number of others
violated the ordinance and they. were con
victed by Justice Edgar.
' Fedderwltz claimed that his imprison
ment was unlawful and based Ills appeal
on three counts, viz.: Because there was
no Justice's court of. the town of Berke
ley; secondly, because thte ordinance de
fining the offense of which he wait con
victed is void, and thirdly. ne:ause the
complaint upon which he was prosecuted
did not charge the offense defined In the
ordinance.
By a vote of four to three the Supreme
Court yesterday remanded George Fed
derwitz of Berkeley to the custody of tho
Sheriff of Alameda County, and he will
be Immediately taken Into custody to
gerve. the sentence imposed upon him by
the Justice of the Pc-ace of Berkeley.
He was convicted of violating an
ordinance which prohibit!) the sell-
Ing â¢ or giving away of malt or
spirituous liquors In the town of
Berkeley. The conviction was had before
Robert Edgar, a Justice of the Peace, and
Fedderwltz appealed to thÂ« Superior
Court. The Judgment of the Justice's
court was affirmed and the defendant's
counsel took his case to the Supreme
Court on a writ of habeas corpus, and
again they were defeated. The caHO Is of
great Importance to the residents of
Berkeley and also the entire bar of tho
State, aB the questions of law Involved
are ably discussed In the opinions filed by
the Justices.
It -was begun when Trustee R. C.
Staats moved that the report of ', the Li
cense Committee . recommending that
the" anti-caloon.; ordinance be repealed
be Â¦; adopted. This was seconded by
Trustee Thomas Dowd, and then
speeches began. : An opportunity, was
given to the temperance' people
BERKELEY, Nov. ,26.â The anti-saloon
license of Berkeley .was given another
two weeks* leaie of life by the Trustees
to-night, but it'was only a' postponement
of its death, for four, of the seven Trus
tees spoke In favor of -Its repeal. \. ,

Berkeley Ordinance Prohibiting Sale
W> think the ordinance Is valid so far as it
relates to the charge apalnst the petitioner.
As to the other matters the case calls for no
expression of opinion. VFe think the com
plaint was sufficient and the petitioner Is re
manded.
Justice Temple wrote a dissenting cpm
!on. which was concurred In by Jubilees
litp.Phaw and. Harrison. He declares th.it
the Legislature exceeded Its authority i:i
pup.-Inp, an act permitting a special (.'num
eration of any municipality, and In con-
Ptquence the appointment of a Justice of
the Peace by the Board j of Supervisors
was illegal, and the Justice had no furlfl
dlctlon to pass upon any violation of any
oidnip.nce of the city of Berkeley; In other
word?, that the special enumeration could
not be made valid and that the Cjfibslu
catlon must be in . accordance with the
Gereral Government census, wlr.ch
makes the township one of the fifth ciass.

SALOONS MAY SOON OPEN.
Another objection to the ordinance wu that
It creates a favorite cla.se, viz.: licensed drug
gists and physicians, who by combining to
gether and complying wlÂ»h eapy conditions
may carry on the traffic in intoxicating llquois
to any extent. Â¦
The charge upon which the jetitlonrr was
convlcteil was that of selling and givin.sr away
malt and spirituous' liquor*. It is not all>:ffÂ«d
that he kept a saloon, but that he was other
wife engaged In the traffic either as a whole
sale or retail dealer and the question is
whether the ordinance contain* a valid pro
hibition ngaln*t the act chai-jred.
Berkeley has had a lejfal existence ever
Â¦ilice the revocation of the Freeholders'
â¢onartc- In 1S9G. The office existing. It
<i,uid be legally filled and the title of the
irvumbent could not be assailed collater
ally In this proceeding. Continuing, the
court says tno next question to be con
slflertd Is the validity of the ordinance
upon which the petitioner was convfcto>?.
Tho ordinance Is then discussed at lengtn
and thn Chief Justice says:

OF WARREK HEATOH
Jennie M. Heaton Will In

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1113 Hroadway, Nov. W.
Judge Greene decided to-day that Jen
nie M. Heaton is the Illegitimate daugh
ter of Warren I>. Heaton and granted her?
letters of administration on his estate. By
the decision Mtes Heaton will come in for
about JoOOO in personal property which
was left by the deceased. The real prop
erty of Heaton. which he deeded to two
nieces before his death, will be the sub
ject for a big legal contest, as the attor
neys for Miss Heaton will attack the va
lidity of the deeds.
When Heaton died on Augmst 31 That ho
left property valued at about $25,000, all
except the JoOOO in personal property be
ing represented by real estate. The per
sonal property Heaton bequeathed to his
nieces. The real property, consisting of
three pieces, was deeded to the nieces and
the deeds were filed the dav after his
death. It 13 this procedure that the at
torneys will attack on the ground that
the delivery wa.Â« not lepal. The daughter.
Miss Jennie M. Heaton. and a nephew, A.
C. Palm, were Ignored entirely by Healon
In the disposition of hia property.
After the announcement of the terms of
Heaton's will Miss Heaton immediately
filed an appl\cat!on for letters of adminis
tration. - She Tiased her claim to the estate
upon her relation as daughter of the de
ceased. Later the contest was heard be
fore Judge Greene and testimony was In
troduced to establish Miss Heaton'3
claims. It was shown that she was born
in 1S65 at Lincoln. Cal. .The fact of ma
ternity was not fixed, but many witnesses
testified that Miss Heaton passed as War
ren Heatrei's dauchter. She was elgrht
years old w'^jfn Heaton married Mrs. M.
N. May. who had had charge of her since
her Infancy. Her life was traced from the
time she was ono year old to the pres
ent. It appears that during all that tirao
she was with Mrs. May. both before and
after she married Heaton in 1*72.

t!s the Police Commissioners,

as to neceF><iry changes in the depart

The Civil Service Commission recently
;:r.r.ounced the names of a lot of eligibles
for th<^ awkward squad. There are tnlrty

is the intention of the Commissioners to
*!1 these from the eligible list, thus brin^
inÂ§: the force up to its normal strength;
t:ut n<--t Dp Jo that allowed by the charter.
With the ar-pointment of the thirty-six

When these promotions are made there
trill be two lieutenants at each .station

Trill have charge of the park district and
a portion of the Western Addition, prob

There was an immense crowd present
on the campus, one oi the largest ever
taking part In a college demonstration.
The bleachers were already covered with
people when the rooters, headed by the
band and the football team, came march

marched around the gridiron and then a
rush was made for seats. Those already
on the bleachers crowded up to make

FOOD IN NEW YORK.
An Experienced Physician's Work.
Vr. Hylande MacGraUi In experimenting
on tha result of food on his own body,
says: "After fating four heaping tea-
ppoons of Grape-Xuts with a little cream.
I had occasion to walk about fourteeji
miles nnd was surprised at my feeling of
Ftrength and buoyancy. On other ooca-
t-ions. when I have taken careful note of
my feelings and sensations, I hax-e dis-
covered that Intellectual tasks are com-
paratively easy when usin? Grape-Xuts
at each meal.
"Of rourse I understand that the theory
regardlng Grape-Xuts is practically per-
fect. That is, the food contains elements
that are well known, and. furnished in a
concentrated and quite delicious form, it
is reasonable to expect results, but the
physiral demonstration of these results
in more -satisfactory, always, than the
mere statement of theory.
"Grape-Xuts combined with fruit and
reasonable %-egetables I prescribe to ail-
ing women and delicate men, and have
not had a case yet that has not furnished
pratlfylng results. A nervous. Irritable
man of 72 became fat and amiable using
Grape-Nuts food as a regular (but not
exclusive) diet.
*'I have found slender. anaÂ«mlc girls
improved rapidly Jn health, eplrfts, weight
and looks, on Grape-Xuts food. It wouid
l>e a blessing to thousands of such gir!s
if this food was used more largely in
boarding schools and seminaries, not to
be administered as medicine, but as a

COUNTY TEACHERS MEET
TO DISCUSS METHODS
OAKLAND, Nov. 26.â The question of
appointment or election of delegates to
the next Republican city convention will
shortly be brought before the City Cen
tral Committee for consideration, in view
of the new sections. of the political code
defining a convention as a body composed
of delegates elected at a primary. Chair
man Breed of the Republican | County
Committee has the matter In hand.
The following expressions of opinion
were given to-day: ' L^
City Attorney Dow said: -"There Is a
rumor to the effect that <the Attorney
General has given an opinion to the Sec
retary of: State that he could, put on the
ticket recently voted the names of nomi
nees that were not nominated by 'such a
convention composed of delegates elected
at a' primary, as section 1186 of the Politi
cal Code provides. I refer-to theProhi
bitlonlsts and Socialists, .who did not hold
primaries. I have not yet given the sub
ject serious consideration." . Â¦
Chairman A. H. Breed of the Republi
can County Central Committee said: "I
have had no talk with the members of
the City Central Committee, because the
national and county campaign required
all of my attention. I do not know what
will be done, but before long I will take
the I matter under -consideration, because
it is one that will be of interest to all of
US."
Deputy City Attorney Condon said:
"There exists the Porter primary law,
passed In * 1S66, which devises a plan by
which primaries might be held, but, on its
face It does not purport to be compulsory.
Now comes this new law defining,*con
ventions. The question arises whether, In
viewof. the; annulment of the Stratton
law, a" convention composed In any other
way than . by election of delegates at'a
primary would be a. legal body."
Determined.
Question of Appointment or of Elec
tion to Convention Will Be
TO ASCERTAIN HOW TO
SELECT THE DELEGATES
Her Granddaughter Receives Per
mission of Board of Supervisors
for Her to Enter.'
OAKLAND, Nov. 26.â Miss Anna Fox
applied to the Board of Supervisors this
morning for a permit for her grand
mother, Mrs. Constance Davison, to enter
the County Infirmary at San Leandro.
Supervisor Roeth, to whom the matter
was referred, readily granted tha re
quired permission.
Mrs. Davison Is the aged woman who
waa tried last week for insanity. The
disclosures as to her life 'showed her to
have been a woman of refinement and
prominence and at one time of consider
able wealth. Misfortunes overtook Mrs.
Davison and the other members cf her
family and finally her mind became cloud
ed and she was sent to the inlirinary.
She is 97 years of age. Tha family is un
able to care for her, 3he requiring more
nursing than their financial condition will
allow.

Tho battle concerning the saloon has di
vided the townspeople.
W. H. Cooke has sent a communication
to the Supervisors In which he claims that
none of the saloon licenses at Sunol were
leg-ally obtained. He asserts that the only
citizens qualified by law to sign an appli
cation are W. Day, George Trlmlngham,
Archie Ager. Fred Aver, Anderson,
George Buttner, Johnson, Ram
baud, H. H. Ellis and E. C. Apperson. He
asserts that at least six of these names
should appear upon all petitions. Cooke
asks the board to Inform him what steps
are . necessary to have illegally granted
licenses revoked.
OAKLAND, Nov. 26.â The Board of Su
pervisors has taken under advisement for
one week the application of citizens of
Decoto for revocation of Harry Fortune's
liquor license, charges being made that
Fortune was conductinga disorderly house.
The board to-day heard Fortune's de
fense. He presented a counter petition,
signed by Mrs. Minnie Ibberson. Mrs. T.
S. Fereira, M. J. Souza, William Ferra,
Mrs. J. Duarte. Mis3 Duarte, Mrs. M.

Water Front, Notss.
The whaling bark Fearless Is due any
aay now from the Arctic. She has been
g-one quite a long time and is bringing
nome four whales. Captain James Me-
Kenna has been gone from San Francisco
for nearly six years and his many friends
will be glad to welcome him home.
The Harbor Commissioners met yester
day and decided to advertise for bids for
the cement to be used on the new work
contemplated on the front. It is calcu
lated that from 10,000 to 12,000 barrelB will
be required.
The German ship Flotbek has arrlvedat
Yokohama from Tampa. She was long
overdue and 15 per cent reinsurance was
being paid on her.

Shipping Intelligence.
Naval Militia Ship Tied TJp at the
Foot of Powell Street.
The naval reserve training ship Marlon
has been moved from the stream to sec
tions 1 and 2 of the seawall. The an
nual inspection of all members of the bat
talion will be held aboard to-night, and
as the notices were only issued yesterday
there is a great hurry and scurry in get
ting the men together.
The reason for taking the Marlon to the
seawall is the fact that she broke her
windlass during last Tuesday night's gale.
When the storm came up she began to
drag and the starboard anchor haa to be
let go. It fouled with the port anchor and
then the trouble began. While hauling in
the pert anchor the main ge.ar on the
windlass broke and tugs had to take hold
of the training ship and anchor her near
the seawall. AH of yesterday the boat
swain was at work getting his fouled an
chors clear. H'.s windlass was useless,
so he had to use the ash hoist and with
it he and his men did excellent work. A
more clever piece of scheming has never
been done on a ship and the boatswain
and his assistants deserve all the credit.
It Is due to them that the Marlon is along
side the wharf to-day and ready for the
inspection to-night.
Â»
First of Her Kind Afloat.
The clipper ship Roderick Dhu is being
fitted throughout with electricity, and
when the plant is installed she will be
the only failing vessel afloat that is light
ed throughout with Incandescent lights.
The Roderick Dhu has had a cold-storage
plant aboard for nearly a year and, think
ing over the matter. Captain Matson, tho
managing owner, and Captain Johnson,
master of the ship, came to the conclu
sion that It would not cost much to put
In a dynamo. The consequence is that the
Roderick Dhu will sail in a few days light
ed throughout with electricity.
MABION MOVED FROM STREAM.
p=TjÂ«^2HE American ship Marion Chll
1 cott is now owned in San Fran-
I Cisco ?.nd ihis city in the future
1 will be her homo port. Captain
William Matson.wlll be her man
aging owner and in company with the
Roderick Rhu, Falls of Clyde, Santiago
and Annie Johnsnn she will run in the
Spreekels line to H.'lo.
The* Marion Chilcott was formerly the
British ship Kilbrannan. r She went ashore
at Port Townsend and was there aban
doned by her owners. Later the wreck
was purchased by the stevedoring firm
of Barneson & Chilcott, and after some
hard work that firm got her off and re
paired her at considerable cost. The money
expended on her wag more than required
under the law laid down by Congress to
obtain for her an American register, so
the Kilbranran came under the American
flag under the name of the Marion Chil
cott. Since then she has been trading out
of Puget Sound ports and last year made
a trip to Manila for Uncle Sam, carrying
supplies.
The Marion Chilcott is now in Austra
lian waters, and Captain Rock has gone
to Port Adelaide to bring her over for
Captain Matson. He will bring her to San
Francisco, and hereafter Bhe will run be
tween San Francisco and Hilo.
The Marion Chilcott was built at Port
Glasgow in 1882, and is 256 feet longr, 38
feet beam and 22 feet deep. She Is a
great carrier and has made some of the
quickest passages of any of the fleet on
the coast. The chances are that when
Captain Matson gets her , here he will
turn her into a bark. .

IT IS now nearly three years since
Miss Alice Nielsen sang in San Fran
cisco, and during that time, judging
by her performance last night in
"The Singing Girl;" she has improved
much. Her voice Is truer, though hardly
stronger than before, and her acting
shows an intelligent appreciation of char
acter and situation not common in either
comic or grand opera prima donnas. Mr.
Ling, the tenor of Miss Nielsen's com
pany, has a far-away, die-away little
voice that reminds you of the windings of
an Alpine horn heard at a distance. He Is
a better actor than singer. Mr. Cowles,
he that was famed for "The Armorer s
Song," sings as well as ever! not even
De Reszke's .voice, though far better cul
tivated, has, it seem? to me, a finer nat
ural quality than that of Mr. Cowles .
None of the three comedians Mr. Her
bert, Mr. Cawthom and Mr. Slavin. can
sin* at all, but each is really funny in
his own peculiar way, and when they are
combined in pm-h numbers as the Bolero
dance of act II and the Chair, dance of act
111 the trio is irresistibly- funny.
"The Singing Oirl" is staged and cos
tumed with lavlshness, yet with good
taste. Mr. Percy's experienced hand

the color scheme (plnkp and gre enS ) Â° f tne

Mr. Herbert has furnished several fur

described, in pome degree atoned for a

WAGNER'S "DAS RHEINJGOLD"
A GLORIOUS MUSICAL FEAST
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 1900.
With the first measures, before the cur
tain rose, the theater was filled with the
"feeling" of water, with the steady shim
mer and Cow of the violins and grave rise
and fall of the other instruments. The
depths of the Rhine, dimly luminous, are
disclosed, with the Rhine-maidens disport
ing themselves therein â a truly, marvelous
illusion and happy trick of stage machin
ery. To the maidens comes Alberich, the
dwarf, wooing, and then as thief of their
plaything, the Rhelngold. The Rhine
maidens' song, la^t night Fung by Mme.
Schumann-Heink. Frttzi Scheff and Rose
From the wonderful opening, where
Wagner has woven a water melody of 136
measures upon one chord, to the last note,
without Intermission, two hours and a
quarter later, tho "Rhelngold" was heard
in absolute silence and darkness by an
audience keyed to highest attention from
start to finish. With the subtlest sense
of the "suitable surroundings." Wagner
well knew what he was a.bout in order
ing that his operas be heard in the dark.

into the pictures. There is no cool regard

of it, one with the players, suffering and
pleasuring with them.
mains to be saidâ that the form has
reached Its ultimate. So saying, one may
venture into more definite and reluctant
criticism of th*> first taste of Wagner at
his most that has been accorded to San
Francisco.
To-night we shall follow further the ad
ventures of the gods In "Die Walkeure,"
and we shall also comp down to earth to

There was not, In spite of the countless
opportnnltles and the high pitch of things
generally, even a suggestion of absurdity
about the performance. The sublime nev
er toppled into the ridiculous; but, oh!
what a mere thread lay between some
times! The stage management was per
fect, the orchestra played as one man and
the chorus and ballet, "they never could
be missed."

with its disappearing dwarf, the dragon
and the tiny earthchlldren. In this scene
comes Mr. Bispham's big turn. The
fourth change shows again Walhalla, and
the rainbow bridge of the gods, accom
panied by the never-to-be-forgotten rain

, "We were out a few hundred yards when
I signaled the engine-room -] to stop, not
thinking the. tide would carry. ns down so
rapidly as It did. "We seemed to lie still
wrapped around in that blanket of fog
for fifteen, minutes or so. Then I heard
the Bay City's whistle and knew she was
coming out of her slip. Not exactly
knowing; where we were, I headed thÂ«
ferry-boat's passengers. To add to the
other alarming features, the giant bow
of the transport Slam lying a little way
east of the Morse, now poked into view
when the fog for a moment lifted, and
seemed about to cut the ferry-boat In
halves.
Finally, after about twenty minutes'
hard work, the Piedmont was- got clear
and steamed into her slip, with much of
her gilt and gingerbread smashed but the
hull practically uninjured- Captain and
passengers both attribute their safety to
the fact that the Piedmont only drifted
Into the Morse. Had the ferry-boat been
under steam when she struck the ship a
terrible bay disaster might have been re
corded.
Captain "Walter Clalrville Elves the fol
lowing account of the disaster:
"lj was at the wheel with Chief Mate
James H. Douglass. "We were on the 11
o'clock trip from Oakland. Just as we
were entering slip 5 a voica from some
where, I suppose- one of the lookouts,
hailed us, saying there was a boat In the
slip. The fog was heavy as a blanket and
we couldn't seo a stone's throw In front
of us, bo we backed out into the stream.
Immediately -the Piedmont started to
grind and bump against the side of the
Morse with great violence. The passen
gers, terrified, rushed to and fro, not ex
actly knowing what had happened. Men
shouted for life preservers and the boats,
women screamed, and the deck hands and
officers of the boat passed through the
cabins full of frightened people, endeavor
ing to calm their fears. They succeeded
to some extent, but the worst, from the
passengers', point of view, was yet to
come. Captain Clalrville saw that It
would be necessary to get the Piedmont
clear of the Morse's forward works, and in
order to do this he signaled the engineer
to go ahead. As the big ferryboat moved
slowly along the side of the Morse, the
ship's cathead, which remained entangled
in the Piedmont, cut the entire side of the
upper cabin out as neatly as if it were
a paper knife.
The crash of rending woodwork, the
noise of breaking glass, the din of the fog
bells and whistles, the loud commands
hurriedly given on both the Piedmont and
the Morse revived the panic among the
So dense was the fog that the flr*t In
timation of danger officers or passengers
had was whem the crash came.
Captain Clairvillei was bringing bis ship
Into slip No. B, her accustomed berth,
when a warning voice cried that the slip
was already occupied. The Piedmont waa

Del Adelphia, the magician, introduced
several tricks last nijght. He does some
clever palming, and his egg trick has
rarely been better done here. Martine
Brothers are clever acrobats. Nora Bayea,
the phenomenal contralto, sang several
new songs. The balance of the bill in

At Fischer's Concert House Cortnne
staged for the first time "Historical An
tique," a unique act, last night. It Is a
pretty conception. MmÂ«. Gabriel Stlrval
displayed a good mezzo soprano and Mae
Edgerton gave a graceful and daring aer
ial exhibition. Irene Franklin, cornet
soloist, was well received, and Olive Vail
and Argyle Tully rendered new songs.
Adelbert and Adelaide Frank presented an
amusing skit, "Her Bashful Lover." and

Herrmann the Great has been dead mv
eral years, but in his place in life there
lives another great Herrman. Louis, of
this famous family of prestidigitators, ac
companied by "the five Noases," accom
plished musicians, Is on this week at the
Alhambra. The bill opens with "Thirty
with Herrmann," and during that interval
the master sives a series of experiments
in legerdemain, many heretofore unat
tempted. The cannon ball and rabbit
trick, tho orange," lemon, nut and glove
trick, the appearing ducks and the gold
fish presentation are the most inteTMtins
of these acts of magic. All are entertain
ing, and as Herrmann announced, "The
closer you look the less you see." A sax
ophone selection by the NossÂ«Â» was the
most pleasing number on their bill,
though all were well received. The house
was well filled last evening: and large
houses are expected all week.

Haverly's Mastodon Minstrels packed
the California Theater to Its capacity
again last night, and every song and joke
In the first part and every act In the

of twenty years ago when Charley Reed

audience in a roar of laughter. A spe

amuslns situations were thoroughly en
joyed by the large audience. There was
a lack of snap In the first two acts, ap
parently caused by unfamlllarity with the
lines, but full amend was made in thp
other two act. Howard Hall as Court
ney Corlls, the young gentleman of leis
ure vlth theories, was entirely successful
and was capitally supported by Miss Lila
Cor.vcro as Flo?, the much-sought original
of the painting, who gave an excellent
rendition of theÂ« part of an Ingenue. How
ard Boott 88 Launcelot Bargiss, the.in
ppired poet Rnd Edwin T, Emery as Paul
Hollyhock, hl3 - son-in-law, were good,
while Clarence Alontalne as Signo? Pal
mira Tnmborini was in his element. Miss
Ada Lewis as Jessie, the servant with
aspirations, added greatly to the success
of the play, Marie Howe, Miss Polly
Stockwell and the others in the cast had
congenial parts. The principals received
an enthusiastic recall at the close of the
third act which was well deserved.
