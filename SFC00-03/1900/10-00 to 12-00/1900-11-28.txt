ST. PAUL. Minn.. Nov. 27.-Senator
Cushman Kellogg Davis, chair
man of the Committee on Foreign
Relations of the Senate, died at
his home In this city to-night at
8:40 o'clock. He had suffered greatly dur
ing two months of sickness and gradually
sank away, being unconscious for several
hours before death, and, so far as could
be known, suffered no pain. Yesterday,
appreciating tfce approach of the end. Mrs.
Davis sent for Venerable T. H. M. Vll-
Hers Appleby, archdeacon of the Protest
ant Episcopal dlrcese" of Minnesota, and
Rev. Theodore Scdgrsrlck.^rector of the
Church of St. John the Evangelist. An
attempt had been made to ?ecure the at
tendance of Bishop Whipple. but the
Bishop was in Florida. Senator Davis was
for a time sufficiently rational to express
his grateful appreciation of the clergy
men's ministrations.
The kidney affection which developed
during his early Illness refused to yield
to treatment and resulted In death.
Grouped about the deathbed were Sen
ator Davis* immediate family, his devoted
wife, his aged father. Major H. H. Davis,
and his two sisters. Mrs. Morford and
Mrs. Bartlett Tripp. His law partner. C.
A. Verance. and his wife were also pres
ent, as well as the doctors and nurses. The
family had fceen prepared for the- end
since the frrst sinking spell, which oc
curred last Friday night, and all have
been where they could be summoned at a
moment's notice. The Senator had been
in a comatose state during the day. Death
came almost imperceptibly and the closing
scene was marked with but little Incident.
His last conscious utterance was the ex
pression of a wish to live; not for the sake
of life itself, but because he believed his
country needed him. His -words were;
"Oh, that I might live five years more for
my country's sake."
Cushman Kellogg Davis was born In
Henderson, Jefferson County, N. Y., June
16, 1S38. In that year his parents moved
to Waukesha. Wis., where his father
farmed until 1850. After attending the
common schools young Davis spent three
years in Carroll College, at Waukesha,
preparing himself for the University of
Michigan, Â¦ from which he- graduated. In
1S57. During his boyhood he held for some
time a position as telegraph operator in
Â¦what Is now a suburb of Milwaukee. Af
ter his graduation he entered the law of
fice of Alexander Randall. Â¦ afterward war
Governor of Wisconsin. In I860 Mr. Davis
began the practice of law and also took
an active part in the campaign resulting
In the election of Lincoln. Two years
later, war having contffe, he closed his law
office to enlist in the volunteer army. He
served for two years In. the army of the
Tennessee In Kentucky, Tennessee, Ar
kansas and Mississippi, part of the time
on staff duty. When In 1S64 broken health
compelled his retirement he was first
lieutenant of Company B, Twenty-eighth
Wisconsin "Volunteer Infantry.
Going to St. Paul he formed a law part
nership with his army chief, General W.
A. Gorman, ex-Governor of Minnesota
Territory. In 1868 he was elected to the
State Legislature and two years later was
appointed United States District Attor
ney, serving five years In that position. In
1873. by a. majority of one vote, he was
nominated by the Republicans for Gov
ernor and elected by a majority of 5496.
Senator Davis has been twice married.
His first wife was Miss Laura Bowman,
and afteV she had secured a divorce from
him be married in 15S0 Miss Anna Mal
colm Agnew.
At . the beginning of his second term
Senator Davis was placed on the commit*
teo on Foreign Relations, and when Sen
ator Sherman was transferred to the Cab.
lnet of President McKlnley Senator Davis
was placed at the head of that Important
committee.
In 1S95-96 many friends of the Senator
pressed his name for the Presidential
nomination, but before the State conven
tion to. name delegates met he withdrew,
and McKinley delegates were sent from
Minnesota. During the past four years
Senator Davis' position as chairman of tha
Foreign Relations Committee of the Sen
ate, and Jater one of the Paris Peace Com
missioners, have kept him prominently be
fore the public of all nations. He was re
elected without opposition in 1S99 for nia
third term.
In 1S93 the Republican legislative caucus
voted In favor of the re-election of Sen
ator Davis, but before thÂ« Legislature
voted on the Senatorship various Influ
ences intervened and he was finally elect
ed by a majority of one, although the Re
publicans had seventeen on Joint ballot.
As a student and an authority on inter
national law Senator Davis furnished
briefs to President Harrison and Secretary
of State Blaine on the Chilean dispute and
the Bering Sea controversy.
Mr. Davis' first chairmanship of thÂ«
Senate was of the Committee on Pensions,
which he held throughout his first term.
He was the author of tne pension law of
1S90, which terminated the demands for
excessive pension legislation and also sat
isfied the old soldiers. As a member of
the Committee on Territories Senator Da
vis led the fight for the admission of tha
Dakotas to Statehood, making his first
speech In the Senate on that subject.
'During 1SSS many of the State news
papers advocated his election as United
States Senator, and when the Legislature
of 1SS7 met Senator McMillan withdrew as
a candidate for re-election and Mr. Davis
received every vote.
Governor Davis declined a renominatlon
and resumed the practice of law. His â¢ac
cessor. Governor Plllsbury, retained him
to argue in the United States Supreme
Court the case of the State of Wisconsin
against the city of Duluth and the State
of Minnesota to restrain the opening of
the present ship canal, through which all
the commerce of that port now passes.
Mr. Davis won the suit for Minnesota.
He continued In the practice of law until
1SS7, also giving considerable attention to
politics. In 1SS4 he headed the Elaine dele
gation to Chicago, where he made one of
the nominating speeches for that candi
date. - .-v
The campaign Issue was then new, being
whether the State could control the
charges of railroads. Governor Davis as
serted this right and such legislation was
enacted and enforced during his term of
office. During a protracted Senatorial
contest at that session Governor Davis
was one of the candidates, but Chief Jus
tice McMillan was finally elected. It was
at this time that the great grasshopper
plague devastated Southwestern Minne
sota, and Governor Davis raised over n<*>.
000 In money besides supplies for the vic
tims of the plague.

HOTEL. WASHINGTON. Nov.
27.â A modification of the demands
upon China, formulated by the
Ministers in Peking, seems as
sured as a result of the representations
made . to the powers by Secretary Hay.
Great Britain, Russia, France and Japan
have made known to the United States
their desire to adopt only such demands
as China- may be able to meet. Ger
many's proposal to make the execution of
eleven Princes and officials a condition
precedent to further negotiations has no
support and that country Is practically
isolated in her Inclination toward a
vengeance policy. Instructions have been
cabled to Minister Conger to confer with
his colleagues for the purpose of securing
a modification of the demands, especially
those relating to punishment and Indem
nity. It Is the expectation of the admin
istratlon that similar instructions will be
sent by at least four other powers to
their representatives in Peking.
The entire Chinese question was dis
cussed at the Cabinet meeting to-day and
new instructions to Mr. Conger were the
immediate result. The general opinion
of Cabinet members was that the decree

â¢ Leading Powers, Who Uphold America's Stand.
It is understood that the powers are
now discussing the question of demanding
the execution of Prince Tuan alone and
the degradation of other Boxer leaders
and sympathizers. In view of these lat
est developments there is a feeling in of
ficial circles that after all China may
emerge from her present dangerous situa
tion without*" suffering the loss of terri
tory. It was feared that because of the
Anglo-German agreement Great Britain
would support â¢ Germany's vengeance
policy. The fact that Japan had In
dorsed the agreement Beemed to make it
certain that the three powers would pur
sue an Identical, course and make a set
tlement of the Chinese trouble without
further loss of territory impossible. Japan,
however, has taken a stanfl with the
powers anxious for prompt settlement.
Lord Salisbury also threw* the weight of
his influence on the side of early peace,
leaving Germany alone as the advocate
of a policy which would have the one re

WASHINGTON, Nov. 27.-The House
Committee on Military Affairs to-day met
for the purpose of considering the new
army bill. The business was mostly of a
preliminary character, the discussion be
ing quite general on army affairs. The
Republican members of the committee are
apparently in favor of giving the Presi
dent such an army as he requires.
The draft of the bill prepared by Chair
man Hull will be the basis of the measure
which the committee will consider. This
bill provides for an army of the maximum
strength of 100,000 men, with a minimum
of 60,00), and general officers at the rate of
one brigadier general for each 4000 men,
with major generals in proportion.
, Chairman Hull stated there will be but
one bill prepared, and if any staff changes
are contemplated they will be incorpo
rated in that measure. â¢ /
The members of the committee probably
will confer with Secretary Root in a day
or two. This afternoon they went over
the bill which has been kndwn as the
War Department bill, drawn on lines sug
gested and approved by Secretary Root.
The War Department, bill provides for a
maximum of 96,000 men and a minimum of
58.000, with thirty regiments of infantry,
fifteen regiments of cavalry and a gradual
increase of the artillery until at the end
of five years there will be 18,000 men. The
artillery is not to be organized Into regi
ments, but as batteries and organizations
of heavy and fieid artillery.
With the maximum army there Is to be
150 men to each infantry company, making
1S30 men to a regiment. The maximum of
cavalry troops is to be 100 men. There is
no provision ' for a lieutenant general in
the War Department bill, but under the
present law the senior major general com
manding would have the rank of lieuten
ant general.- The War Department bill
does not give the same increase of major
generals and brigadier generals as the
Hull bill. V
The detailed staff provisions are an im
portant feature of the measure. It' is pro
vided that hereafter vacancies in the staff;
excepting the medical corps, pay corps
and engineers, shall , be filled by details
from the line, such detailed officers being
subject to line duty r at any time. This is
the same as the Hull bill of the last Con
gress and is earnestly favored by Secre
tary Root. The War Department bill pro
vides that the promotions shall be made
from the regular army according to the
present rank down to and Including the
rank of captain. The officers of the pres
ent volunteer army can become officers in
the regular, army, but in the grades, of
first and second lieutenants only, the va
cancies in the captains' rank being filled
from the first lieutenants of the present
regular establishment. The relative rank
of the volunteer officers entering the reg
ular establishment to be determined by se
niority. : â¢
The committee will not hold another ses
sion until Friday, adjourning over to
morrow and Thanksgiving.

PLOT TO KILL
LORD ROBERTS
HONOLULU, Nov. 2O.-Secretary Gage
of the Treasury Department, has sug
gested to Governor Dole a plan whereby
customs duties may be paid and the coin
u^ed not leave the country. In a letter
received here by the Zealandla the Sec
retary says that duties on imports may
be paid in Saa Frar.cisco and the receipts
aecepu-d here by the local collector of
customs. Nearly or quite all of the im
porters of European goods which are
dutiable have agents in San Francisco
and always have money from that side
due. The adoption of Gage's plan will
put an end to a serious steady drain of
coin from Hawaii.
The local steamship companies and
other owners of vessels have been ad
vist_-d by Collector Stackabte to comply
with American shipping laws, which have
not been in force here before this time.
Most of the vessels here were run in vio
lation of the rules as to painting ol
names and official numbers. Tne schooner
Rob Roy was held in port last week be
cause, though she is an American vessel
she had a Japanese captain. She is one
of the small island fleet and was char
tered and run by a Japanese company.
Washouts and floods continue to be re
ported from all the different islands ad
a result ofi the recent storm, which was
general throughout the group. With the
heavy rains came the strongest "kona"
or high south wind, known here for many
years. The only lives lost as a result of
the storm, so far as is known,, were those
of two Japanese fishermen, who werÂ«
blown to *ea in a small boat at Walmoa,
Kauai, and have not been heard of since.
The big pumping plant of McBryde's
plantation, also on Kauai, sustained con
siderable damage by flood. A cement wall
by which it was protected gave way and
the pump was flooded. Chief Engineer
Burns narrowly escaped with hla life by
climbing a flywheel and breaking through
a roof after his escape had been -cut off
below by water.
On Maual and Hawaii the Btorm'carried
away telephone wires in many places,
washed out railwi^- tracks and caused
great floods that interrupted business for
two or three days. Flumes and bridges
were wrecked and a considerable outlay
will be required to repljace them.
A remarkable escape tis reported from
Wailuku, where a Japanese dwelling: was
carried away by water. A small baby
was left behind when the older people
fled from the house. Some hours later
the child was found asleep in the house,
far from the place where the building had
stood. - *
One of the results of the storm In Hono
lulu was to cause a shortage of flsh, as
none could be caught during. the heavy
wind and rain. No damage is reported to
any of the island shipping, though many
of the vessels were weatherbound at dif
ferent ports.-
The divorce suit of Mrs. Miner against
Dr. F. L* Miner is developing many sen
sational details. The couple were for
merly residents of Salinas and" San Fran
cisco. Cal. They were married fourteen
yean? ago In Leeds. England. Mrs.
Miner makes many allegations of ex
tremely cruel treatment during most of.
the fourteen years. The doctor has filed
an answer in which he charges his wife
with havlnjr ill-treated him for years. He
averred that she was of such a Jealous
disposition that she greatly reduced his
practice by her actions toward his woman
patients. The case is being- heard before
Judge Humphreys.

Considerable interest is centered in the
new legislature, or more properly, in the
newly clectQd house of delegates, which
will hold its first session on December 3.
The first session will be held in tempor
ary quarters, as the island, unfortunately,
has no public building which will accom
modate legislative bodies. At this session
a bill appropriating funds for an insular
building probably will be passed. The en
tire legislative assembly, including: both
houses, is composed of Republicans. A
Fplit in the lower house is predicted after
the first few BCEEions. The body has a
.Treat work laid out. The first and most
important matter ta be disposed of will
be the remodeling of the laws of the
island, without which it is considered cer
tain Porto Rico can have no future. The
members are taking a mutual Interest in
their new duties, and most of them have

which is illegibly signed, is as follows:

of Richard Croker at his English home

Places Which Bishop Potter's Com

NEW YORK, Nov. 27.â Persons ' living
in East Twelfth street, in Seventh avenue
and bther sections of the city complain
that opium dens are being run In thetr
neighborhoods with scarcely an attempt
at concealment and with an ever increas
ing patronage.
Â¦ Girls still in their teens can be seen any
afternoon or evening frequenting these
places. Another alarming feature of the
spread of vice is that many confirmed
opium smokers havo adopted the practice
oi sending small children, from ?> to 10
years old, to these shops. Placing a twen
ty-five cent niece on the grimy counter,
one of these little ones will calmly ask for
"a shell of dope."

LONDON, Nov. 27.â Richard Croker
said ih an interview* at his coun
try home at Wantage that the re
formers of New York are not sin
cere. Says Mr. Croker in the inter-'
view:
"These men cannot fool the people of
New York again. The only cause they are
fighting for is the Republican party. Their
onlv aim is to elect a Republican Mayor
of New York. They are responsible for
the New York charter. They x-reated a bi
partisan Police Board. What we should
have is a single-headed Police Board. Then
we could place responsibility on some
body's shoulders. Two-thirds of the po
lice captains In New York are RepublK
cans. Is the Democratic organization,
which does not control the Police Board,
responsible for the administration of these
Republican captains?
"What we mean to do is to satisfy the
people of New York. These reformers talk
about vice in New York. Have they ever
been in London or Paris? â¢ They are not
sincere." Â¦ . .
Croker will go to Carlsbad In a few days

will sail for New York on th#> Deutchland

Against Sunday Performances.
The Actors' Church Alliance of America
has begun an active campaign against
Sunday theatrical performances and its
members promise to keep it up until
actors have one day of rest in seven, the
same as persons in the ordinary avoca
tions of life. It claims to have caused
Â»the arrests which have been made at New
York theaters the past three Sundays, and
it is now keeping an eyÂ« on the prosecu
tion of these cases. The Rev. Francis J.
Clay Moran, chairman of the law com
mittee, has given out a copy of a letter
which he had sent to Deputy Chief Cort
wright last Friday, dealing with the sub
ject. It had been stated tnat the arrests
in question were due to the actions of the
Tammany purity committee, and Mr.
Moran took occasion to correct this im

Chance for Capital in Ecuador.

especially friendly to the United States

chief executive. He has a son at West

capital to come into the country. For
capitalists I believe Ecuador offers extra

MARCONI MAKES
GREAT DISCOVERY
Will Be Able to Send Mes
sages Across the Ocean
Without Wires.
Special Cable to The Call and New York Her
ald. Coryricht. 1DO<\ by the Herald Pub
lishing Company.
LONDON, Nov. 2S.â "Signor Marco \i
has mastered his mast difficulty," re
marked one of his staff to a representa
tive, of the Daily Express yesterday. "Ac
cording to reasonable calculations," he
added, "we shall have America and Great
Britain upon speaking 1 terms before the
first Christmas of the new century."
To make this statement, however, was
a very different thing from making known
Signor Marconi's secret. In general terms
though, the basis of his triumph may be
indicated to a small degree." Wires must
be used, one at either end and about two
hundred feet long, called antennae or
feelers. This Is obviously not a costly ex
pedient, but the new fact that obviated
the necessity for masts as high as Snow
don is the discovery of a means of con
trolling their air waves.
Signor Marconi's infinite capacity for
taking pains has enabled him to construct
an apparatus whereby he can lengthen
the air waves to an almost unlimited ex
tent. Furthermore, by the same Ingenious
device, sound will be made to travel close
to the surface of the ocean over the whole
distance, thus circumventing the dreaded
difficulty presented by the curvature of
the earth. Hence the masts erected at
Southampton and on Long Island need,
not, it Is now contended, be higher than
the roof of a New York skyscraper.
"All this seems of vast importance to
the commercial world," remarked the- rep
resentative of the Express.
"What It undoubtedly means Is that
submarine cables will be superseded,"
was the reply, "and that at a hundredth
thousandth part 'of cost" ' .

j Archdeacon Sinclair read the latter
part of the service and then the coflln
Â¦ was lowered into the crpyt. the silence
being only broken by the sobbing of a
few women. The benediction was given by
the dean and then there occurred what
has never before been heard in St. Paul's.
Fifty women, ail dressed in the deepest
black, and the same number of men.
gathered near the coffin, aryse from their
knees. They were the chorus of the
Savoy Theater. In quivering, trembling
tones, they commenced to sing Sullivan's;
"tirother. Thou Art uone Before Us." A
great hush fell on the crowd that had
started to leave the building. Gathering
courage, the women's voices swelled out
mail every corner of the vast cathedral
re-echoed this sad requiem lrom those
who had so often sung the lighter lyrics ;
of the composer they now mourned. As
this died away, the organ took up the
majestic strains of the dead inarch from
'â¢Saul," the choir, clergy and mourners
filÂ«Â»d out and one of the most Impressive
national funerals held in England came to
an end.
The vault containing the remains of Sir
Arthur Sullivan is situated in the extreme
eastern corner of the crypt, close to the
tomb of Dr. Bryce. the famous writer of
church music of the last century. Near

Just as Mr. Choate. Charles Wynd

well-known persons arrived at the
Chapel Royal, where Sir Arthur Sullivan's
funeral was being hejd. the attendants
received orders to close the doors, as tip?
chapel was full. Mr. Choate expostulated
and showed his card of admission, but all
to no avail. Mr. Sims remarked in a low
tone. "The Anglo-American entente cor
dial** is shattered -after all these yearn;"
For ten minutes the United Stales Era
bassador was kept waiting, but finally the
attendants were ordered to admit him and
the distinguished persons with him. The

The decision holds that by the terms o:
the written lease the rent was made pay

court has no doubt that the defendani

It was not satisfied that Senator Asht

DOCTOR SUES WIFE OF
; MILLIONAIRE FOR FEE
Asks for Three , Thousand Dollars,
but the Jury Considers
Twenty Sufficient.
PHOENIX. Ariz.. Nov. 27.â In an action
brought by Dr. A. W. Cottrel! of Phoenix,
Ariz., against Mrs. Mary V. Jones, wife ol
a Pittsburg millionaire manufacturer, to
recover $3000 for. professional services,
judgment of $20 was rendered in favor of
the plaintiff, which was regarded by the
jury as adequate compensation for ten
visits made by the doctor. Although in
his complaint Cottrell prays for $3000. the
action was regarded as a "bluff," and in
his testimony to-day he brought the figure
down to $300. The suit was brought last
April, soon after Mrs. Jones had received
Cottrell's' treatment for. a disease which
consisted of bleeding at the nose.
Mrs. Jones returned .to Pittsburg and
consulted her family doctor, who Imme
diately reached the conclusion- that Cot
trell had attempted to frighten his patient
into parting with a large sum of money.
Cottrell weakened to-day, j refusing on the
stand .to describe Mrs. Jones' disease
which the Pittsburg doctor declared to bÂ«
of very ordinary character. Jones has
not yet taken .action against the doctor
and refuses to make known his plans.

Prominent Pennsylvania Educator
Wanted at San Jose on Warrant
Sworn Out by a
Girl.
SAN JOSE. Npv. 27.â Professor Davifl
Rhinehart Porter King, who Is said to oc
cupy the chair of social economics in the
State Normal School in Pennsylvania, has
been charged 1 by Hilda J Johnson, a
young woman who resides near Agnews
Station, with having betrayed her under
promise of marriage. A warrant was is
sued by Justice Wallace for his arrest,
and Sheriff Langford Is now trying to ap
prehend the educator, who undoubtedly
has left the State.
King, who holds diplomas from the
University of Pennsylvania and Yale, -s
said to be prominent among the edncators
of the Keystone State. He came to Cali
fornia several months ago to settle up the
estate of his uncle, D.J. Rhinehart. who
died here a couple of years ago. A
large farm and orchard near Agnews
were included in the property left by the
uncle. Jonnson had charge of the place,
and nis daughter, Hilda, the complainant,
did the housework.
King went to live at the f^rri as soon
as he arrived here. He was possessed of
a charming manner and was a pleasing
conversationist, and he made love to the
girl. Shortly after King arrived Johnson
went to San Francisco to work, and his
daughter engaged to do the housework
for King and a couple of laborers about
the place. Her mother had been dead for
pome years. to the girl's story
King became more ardent than ever in
his wooing after her father left. When
the time set for the marriage came he put
it off. Finally, a day or so ago. she de
manded that he marry her to save her
from disgrace. He promised to do so, and
came to San Jose, leaving, her under the
impression that he was going to obtain a
marriage license. He never returned to
the farm.
Miss Johnson at once came to San Jose
and found he had made preparations to
ga to some point in Oregon. To-day she
swore to the warrant for his arrest.
Sheriff Langford has notified the officers
north of here and in Oregon to be on the
lookout for King and arrest him.

FEMAXE BURGLAR AT WORK.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA. Novj 27.â Miss Rena
Mohr, head nurse in the Jenner Sani
tarium on Third street, has brought suit
against Dr. F. S. Byington, who Is at tho
head of the hospital, for back pay,
amounting to *147 S3. Dr. Byington Is not
only prominent as a physician, but is one
of the most popular society gentlemen in
this city. About two : years ago he
opened the sanitarium and emergency
hospital on Third street. He has had a
number of nurses employed there and one
or two assistant physicians at different
Intervals. Â»
In her complaint. Miss RenarTiIohr al
leges there is $147 83 due her from Dr. By
ington for services rendered as a "head
nurse in the Jenner Sanitarium. The fair
young plaintiff took the stand In Judge'
Brown's Justice Court to-day and related
incidents leading to her coming to this
city to accept the position of head nurse
in the sanitarium. She testified that she
had been a nurse for many years and sub
mitted testimonials from reputable wit
nesses as to her efficiency. She claimed
the doctor's reason for not paying her her
wages was that he was too "hard up."
The witness was asked if it was not
true that she had come to Santa Rosa
because she thought she stood a good
chance of becoming the wife of Dr. By
ington and she replied.very sarcastically:
"Excuse me, I don't want anything to
do with a hard-hearted chicken like him.
He has no heart at all for any human be
ing."
Dr. Byington went upon the stand this
afternoon and testified that the defendant
had represented to him that she was a
trained nurse, but three days . after her
arrival " he had discovered she was not
what she claimed to be and he told her
so. He put her to the test of sterilizing
and found she did not understand it. He
had taken pity on her and allowed her
to stay at the sanitarium after he had
told her he did not want her. because
sh? was without a home and he did not
want to turn her out of doors.
The case was continued until to-mor
row and promises to be an interesting one.

Brooks, Zlorlte and leader of the Dowle
faith healers in this city, and W. W.
Maltby. a carpenter, who Is a member of
the faith healers' church, were Rrrested
here this afternoon and charged with
having caused thp death of the 3-year-old
son of Malt by. The arrests took place at
the close of an inquest over the body of
the child. The evidence showed that the
little one had died of diphtheria, and in
the opinion of several modical men. In
cluding Dr. Faran, superintendent of tho
Iioard of Health, he could have been
saved had a doctor been called in. The
father of the child stated in his evidence
that he would not have called a doctor
under any circumstances, as he did not
believe in them.
The death of the son of Maltby oc
curred on Friday last. The child had been
ill for pome days, and the father and
motl".Â«r had called In the elder, who
prayea over the child. Notwithstanding
the prayers the Infant died. Letter the
father went to Dr. Hall and asked him to
come to the house. The doctor found
That the child had died of diphtheria, and
he notified the sanitary officer, who quar
antined the house. The father that night
applied for a burial certificate, which was
refused by order of the Mayor and an in
quest asked for. This was concluded this
afternoon and a verdict was brought in
charging the father and the faith healing
leader with having caused the death of
the child.
There is much feeling against the faith
healers here, for this is the third death
that has occurred through refusals to call
in physicians. On Sunday, when an open
service was held, a number of people
bombarded the elder with over-ripe eggs.

i crack John A. Morris, the flying
JJ^ Texan, to dip his -colors In token
of defeat at Tanforan yesterdav
and then with the wire only a few yards j
away was in turn nipped and beaten out
by Kddle Jones. It happened In tbÂ«
fourth and most interesting of the six
numbers on the programme. Under the
conditions John A. Morris (his first ap
pearance) carried 97 pounds and True
Blue 94. Gibraltar figured among the
over-night entries, but Sam Hildreth
scratched his horse, possibly scenting
easier game in sight. As the local horse
was supposed to be Letter conditioned he
enjoyed the honors of favoritism, closing
at 7 to 10. There was 2 to 1 in plenty about
Morris until Fred Cook left the block to
play him. which caused a general "swipe"
all around; then 8 to 5 was the very best.
The result of the. race, which was over
seven furlongs, was not entirely unfore
seen by some of the mere experienced and
long-headed ones.. From the start the
two choices went away at a heart-break
ing â¢ clip and It was evident something
mu.Â«t snap. Opposite the paddock th'J
Texas bred horse had enough and True
Blue, which had made the runnlne and
had answered every call of Coburn's,
looked the winner. In scanning the hori
zon, though, for more Morrises Cobuin
failed to look over his left shoulder, and
before he knew it Wedderstrand ha/1
brought Eddie Jones up from the rear
and was at his saddle skirts. . True Blue
again responded gamely, but too late, the
rank outsider getting over the line first
by a neck. .The time. 1:27*;. does not mark
a fastly run race, hut the track was far
from being fast. While It must be ad
mitted that the favorite was tired care
lessness on the part of his rider contrib
uted largely to the despised one's vic
tory.
The winner, coupled with First Tenor,
was a 12 to 1 shot in the betting. This
race should put John A. Morris on edge,
and True Blue wil: be very busy when
next the pair meet.
It seemed to be an afternoon of close
finishes. Sea Uon Just did beat out Dr.
Bernays. and Tappan lost to Morinel by
a scant head. Three purses fell to fav
| oritf-s.
Roundhead, a IS to 1 shot, with H.
Shields in the paddle; was never headed
in the opening sprint for maiden 2-year

ran second, in front of Thracia.
In â¢ an exceedinely close* -finish, John
ny Schorr's Sea Lion, well rid

i Bernays on the la*t stride. The winning
I horse went to the post favorite, and cut

THEIR REWARD
CHICAGO, Nov. 27. â FVantlc efforts are
being made by shorts caught In the Phil
lips corn corner to swamp him with grain
on the last day of the option. The way
in which they hope to down him and get
themselves out of a tight place Is by re-
Inspection of this week's receipts, which
have been graded No. 3, one grade too
low to pass as contract. '
"There will be big deliveries on Friday,"
said Charles Slade, manager for Counsel
man & Co., "and lots of corn which will
be reinspected will pass at No. 2. At a
time like this, when there is a corner on.
the inspectors are scared, and to be on the
safe side they grade corn No. 3 # where
there is any question about it at all.
knowing that if they are wrong supervis
ing inspectors will go over It and give the
right grade,"
"They won't get a car of it graded up,"
said Phillips, when he was told of the new
tactics of the shorts. "When there is a
corner on there Is always a big demand
for reinspection, but it never amounts to
anything." -
"On account of the corner we?, are get
ting about double the applications for re
inspection which we receive normally,"
said Edward J. Noble, supervising In
spector. "Four times out of five, certain
ly three times out of four, the supervising
inspectors uphold the previous inspec
tion." - ,
Another scheme which has been evolved
for the purpose of swamping Phillips is
the purchase and shipment to Chicago of
corn which was sold by the Pattens In
Buffalo and Montreal when they went out
of the deal in October.
Fifty-one cents marked up on the board
to-day was a new high price in the No
vember deal. Phillips came into the pit
early and lifted the price from forty-nine
cents, where It opened. Between fifty and
fifty-one cents he unloaded 200.000 bushels
his total sales for the day being 240,000
bushels. As he is selling corn bought, at
thirty-six cents, his day's transactions
netted him a profit better than $25 000.
Other days this week are said to have
been equally profitable to him. To-day's
close was fifty cents. Big foreigners, who
it is said constitute the short interest
are still hanging on stubbornly. Predic
tions are freely made that the last day of
the deal will see November corn quoted at
seventy-five cents. Â¦ â¢ - . Â¦
"This deal differs from others." said
Phillips to-day, "in that I have, handled
it by myself. Allthe buying and selling
has been done in the open pit, and I have
hired no- brokers to hoodwink the crowd.
I have known all along how blj? the short
interest was and who was short. They
have known also how much corn I had
The contract corn in Chlcapo is about a
million and a half bushels. The Inspection
sheet to-day was again a disappointment
to the bears, showing only 87,0*) bushels
transferred from private to public ele
vators. Only fifty-seven out of 92C cars
arriving to-day were No. 2.' and only 130.000
bushels of contract No. 2 corn were added
to the total in Chicagrt.

the Soldier and the latter has no affection
for the local man. Both have been
anxious to try conclusions in the ring and
they will be given an opportunity on Fri
day night. A victory means a great deal
to George Green. He has trained faith
fully at San Rafael and will try hard to
defeat his husky opponent.
The ex-soldier has trained at the Six
Mile House and is reported to be in great
fettle. He has rested for nearly three
months and he declares that he will enter
the arena In better condition than he has
been heretofore. That Green Is a danger
ous opponent is evidenced by the way in
which the local middleweights have shied
at making a match with him.
ThreÂ© splrtndid preliminaries will be pre
sented. "Indian Joe" Gregg and' Charley
Hawley are matched to battle six rounds.
The bout should be full of action. PetÂ©

will meet in a ten-round bout.
p-*i#"Â«"^IIE quiet "tip" Is out in sporting
I circles that "Green will win" the
I main event In Friday night's fistic

ed with the abilities of the two contest
ants, this information is not surprising.
That "Green" will be victorious is a cer
tainty. Either George Green or "Soldier"
Phil Green must be declared a victor If
the bout goes the limit, as the articles of
agreement expressly state that there must
be a decision.
The familiar expression, "When Greek
meets Greek, then comes the tug of war."
has been paraphrased by "Bogle" O'EKm

STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Nov. 27.â
An ovation which for its burning enthusi
asm and determined attitude has never
been excelled at Stanford was tendered
to-night to the men who will represent
the cardinal in the annual gridiron match,
with the University of California next
Thursday. The name of each member of
the team was cheered to the echo by the
twelve hundred students and alumni who
crowded the ground floor of the Assembly
Hall. Especially cordial was the recop
t-ion of "Stub" Raitt, the valiant quarter
back, who left a bereaved home five days
before the game in order to be with his
team in the big match. At the mention of
his name tho assembled throng rose to its
feet and for a minute the air was full
of cardinal caps and bunting.
Frank Slaker of the University of Chi
cago, the new fullback on the .cardinal
eleven, and Captain Burnett, who lias
BhQwn rare grit in the practices of the last
few days by playing with a badly sprained
knee, were almost as enthusiastically
cheered.
The programme consisted of speeches
by the alumni, members of the faculty
and team- Professor Burt Estes Howard
was the first called upon. His remarks
were full of humor, and his portrayal of
the revelations made from the heavens
to the members of the Berkeley team to
"use sarsaparilla for that tired feeling"
brought down the house. Charley Fick
ert, captain of the victorious team of '90,
gave an estimation of the comparative
strength of the two teams, and save it as
his opinion that Stanford should win by
a small score. "Jack" Reynolds and Dr.
"Jule" Frankenheimer, halves on the '95
team, Chet Murphy, captain of last year a
team and Quarter for four years, who
have bten coaching the team, , all testi
fied to the excellent condition of Yost's
squad and thought that the cardinal
should win on form. Trainer Murphy said
that the men were physically competent
to make the fight of their lives and would
be trained to the 1 hour. Coach Yost and
President Jordan were both unexpectedly
called away, but left messages of en
couragement for the assembled crowd.
A monster bonllre on the ' campus,
around which the students, headed by the
university band, circled in lockstep, closed
the demonstration.
Coach Yost put the cardinal football
squad through two signal practices to-day.
Tne lirst took place this morning at 10: JO
and the second this afternoon at 3 o'clock.
The men are quick, precise and full of
ginger in their work, and in this even
ing's practice the team showed varsity
lorm. The backs were oft together and
Quarterback Raltt in the interference was
in the best of form. The gritty little
passer has fitted himself into his old po
sition with remarkable alacrity.
"Barring sprains and bruises â¢ the 'men
are in good condition." said Trainer Mur
phy this evening. "Leo and Burnett have
badly sprained knees and it is hard to
tell how -long they will bear up under the
strain of the big game. I>e Forest Is in
condition again and will give a good ac
count of himself."
After the men finished signal practice
this evening Coach Yost expressed himself
as being satisfied with the form of the
team. There have been no changes made
in the end places and they will be filled by
McFadden and Cooper. The center posi
tion is doubtful, McFadden, junior, being
in better condition than Lee. However,
If Lee recovers from his sprained knee
he will go in the line-up as originally de
termined. Right half is still open and lies
between Erb and Smith. Yost will not an
nounce who will draw the coveted honor
till the morning of the game.
Yost has consented to the selection of
Ralph Hoagland. a former Princeton sub
stitute, to act as referee of the big game.
W. B. Goodwin, Yale '88, will be umpire.
Hoagland was accepted upon the recom
mendation of Stagg and Dashiel, two
famous Eastern experts.
BERKELEY, Nov. 27.â Three candidates
of the available varsity material for left
end are laid up with injuries. The only
man left for this position uninjured 13
Williams, the freshman end. He was
given the varsity signals to-night and will
be coached for the big team.
Contrary to â¢ expectations the eleven
played a hard practice game this even
ing. Dibblee, substituting for Hudson nt
left end, had his ankle badly sprained.
Premo, playing the same position on tho
second eleven, was laid up with an in
lured knee. Both men were badly hurt.
Hudson has been out of the sramo since
Saturday owing to an injured arm.- It is
very doubtful whether he will play Thurs
day.
To-night's injuries, coming in quick
succession, have put two good men off tho
substitute list. Williams will be coached
for end. He has not been playing with
the varsity and does not know the signals.
That the coaches are doubtful whether
Hudson, Dibblee or Premo will be able to
take part in the Thanksgiving game is
shown by the manner in which they have
rushed Williams into line.
Williams ia a good man and played a
hard game with the freshmen, but he
lacks experience. The sudden loss of both
the nicked man and substitutes has
greatly weakened the left end.
The general condition of the men is
good. A few nre still suffering from in
juries, but they expect to be all right by
Thursday. -
Captain Pringle's knee is greatly, im
proved. He went through the signal prac
tice with spirit. Hudson's left arm is bad
ly wrenched and the muscles bruised. Al
though he went through the signal prac
tice to-night, in his present condition he
is unable to stand a heavy game. Trainer
George Hufferdine is giving Hudson's arm
every care possible and hopes to put him
in j the field Thursday in good condition.
Smith, right-half, has been below weight.
He is a hard man to keep conditioned.
During the last few days he has been
resting and evidences of staleness are be
ing overcome.' Although he will plav un
der weight in the big game ho will get
up nearly to his old form. The injury to
More's knee has proved to be slight. He
is punting as well' as ever. Clay has re
covered from his bad cold. : .
Professor ' W. E. Magee, director of
physical culture at the State University,
said:
"The physical condition of our men is
pood. Judging from this I can seo no rea
son why we should not win. The game Is
a guess, with our chances as good as
Stanford's." *>
"We have' a : good chance to win." said
Graduate - Manager Reno Hutchlnson.
"Our men have been playing a good,
strong game. ..With -the line doing the
work it has been our backs will be able
to advance the ball."
Colonel George C. "Edwards said: "We
have a good chance for Thursday's pame.
If -the boys go into it with the fighting
spirit we should win. The result depends
on how .our men go on to the field.

CHICAGO. Nov. 27.â Tommy Ryan of
Chicago, defeated Kid Carter of Brooklyn
in Pix rounds at Tattersall's to-night be
fore a crowd of j<KX) people. Ryan had the
better of the milling all the way. with the
exception of two intervals in the first and
second rounds, when Carter sent him
to the mat with right swings. Carter was
l>eaten fearfully about the head and face,
and although he went the limit, he fought
The last three rounds without knowing
much about what he was doing t-xtept
that there was a man la front of him.
whom he had to hit. He fought gamely
to the last, and his Fiiperior weight and
ptrer.Rth were a. heavy handicap to Ryan.
The Utter, however, was much too clever
for Carter, and Rot inside nearly every
swing he miide a:id blocked three out of
five blows that w.-re sent to his body.
George Siler awarded the purse to Ryan
amid loud cheers from the crowd, the ap
plause being fully asÂ» much for the game
uoy from lsmoklyn as for the victor.
The match was at 158 pounds, the men
w.ighing Â»n at <i o'clock. Both men were
under weight, although Carter had six
pounds the better of it when they entered
the ring. Before the fight began it was
announced that on December 31 JoÂ«? Gans
and Terry McGovcrn would fight in Tat
tersal!?. the men to weigh 133 pound.** at
7 o'clock. The match is to be under
straight Quecntborry rules. Gans agreeing
to stop McOovera in six rounds or forfeit
the decision.
Morris Rauch of Chicago and Kid Mc-
Fadden of San Francisco came together
fit 115 pounds. McFadden forfeiting for
being over weight. He looked about eight
to ten pounds the heavier of the two.
They went six very fast rounds, the de
cision being given to McFadden.
Harry Harris and Clarence Forbes, both
of Chicago, fought at 118 pounds. Even
monev was offered on Harris, with no
takers. Forbes wa.Â« given the decision.
It was close, the fighting having been
even throughout.
It was the first decision ever piven
against Harris, and the crowd received
It with mingled cheers and hoots.
The seml-windup was between Jeff
Thorne of Bngland and Jack Beacholtl of
Chicago at 160 pounds. Thorne was given
the decision after two minutes of light
ing Beacholti having injurod Thorne by
a blow below the belt. Beacholtl apolo
gized after delivering the blow. Thorne
was fjuite severely injured, and it was
three minutes before he was able to walk
from the ring.
REFETtEE IS HISSED.
Decision Rendered in Yanger-Corbett
Fight Not Popular.
DENVER. Nov. 27.â Benny Yanger, the
"Tlpton slasher" of Chicago, and Young
Corbett of Denver fought a ten-round
draw before the Colorado Athletic Asso
ciation to-r.ijrht. The decision was very
unpopular, and Referee Jack McKenna
was hissed by the entire crowd as he left
the ring. Corbett floored Yanger seven
times during the fight and was himself
down once.
In the eighth round Yanger went to the
floor from a right swing <>n the Jaw and
pot up very groggy. Corbett went In to
finish him and j>ut him down four times
more, each time for eight seconds, but
he was himsr-'.f so tired that he could not
land hard enough to knock Yanger out.
Tanscr recovered Ptrenpth by the time

until the end. although his blows laciced
the usual steam. With the fxception of

Justice of the Peace G. W. F. Cook has
assailed the provisions of tho charter
under Â¦which his successor wa3 elfcted at
the last election. Judge Cook filed suit
yesterday to restrain the Board of Elec
tion Commissioners from issuing certifi
cates to either of the five Justices of the
I'eace who received the highest number
of votes at the last election. The Justices
wnose positions are thus Jeopardized are
Thomas F. Dunn. G. C. Groezlnger. H. Ij.
Joaehlmsen, John R. Daniels and Percy
V. Lonsr. Upon th^ flllnK of the suit
Moses G. Cobb and W. H. II. Hart, who
represent the plaintiff, went before Judge
Hunt,Â«to whom the case was assigned tor
trial, and reauested the issuance of a
temporary restraining 1 order. Judga Hunt
refused to Issue the Injunction, however,
and a new tack will be taken by Judge
Cook.
In hi3 complaint Judge Cook sets forth ,
that he was elected under the act or
March 21. 1893. at the election of Novem
ber. 1S98, to hold office for four years.
The provision of the charter providing for
his removal from office and the election
of a successor to the same for terms dif
ferent from that provided in the act to
establish a uniform system of county
governments. Judge Cook allies Is un
constitutional. It is also asserted that
the recent election was not held under
a proclamation issued by the Governor,
as provided by section 1053 of the Political
Code. For these reasons he asks that a
permanent injunction Issue restraining
the Election Commissioners from qualify
ing the Justices-elect.
Claims He Was Elected for Four-
Year Term and Cannot Be Re
moved by Operation of
the Charter.
Asks Injunction Restrain
ing Qualification of His
Successor.

an address yesterday afternoon on

with gTÂ«>at interest, and at its close gave
the speaker a rising vote of thanks.
Captain Charles Nelson, president of the
Chamber of Commerce, introduced Mr.
Barrett, who spoke in part as follows:
It is gratifying to find one's prophecies com

that my wildest fantar'.es of former years re

China should go Into the hands of the rtusslans
how in God's name could w keep them from
establishing prohibitive tariffs? We must
realize the Importance of keeping the entire
area of. China open to the commerce of the
world. â¢Â«
No man can eucceed In getting Oriental trade
unless he Is Â¦willing to make a struggle â¢for It
Our opportunity lies mainly In studying the
field and discovering new lines rather than
competing In the old enterprise*.
If the time comes when San Francisco shall
become a free port It will give you a great ad
vantage in competition that you do not possess
now. I have heard men connected with grÂ»at
enterprises abroad express the hope that your
city would become a free port and predict great
trade development here In consequence of such
charse of policy.
Do everything you can to make your com
mercial museum practical. . You want to be
able to give accurate Information as to every
feature of the foreign trade, and if your mu
seum Is not practical to that degree It will
be useless.
An enterprise of first Importance to American
trade in the East Is the establishment there of
banks: not necessarily new Institutions, but
agencies of our great banking houses. I loo;:
forward to the time when our great banks will
have branches In the principal cities of China
and Japan.
ThÂ« whole Oriental coast has a damn cli
mate, and goods sent there are oftÂ»n not pro
tected against moisture, and In consequence
suffer damage. You must make a study of the
style of bundles and manner of packing de
sired. ; ,
You must not be discouraged by the condi
tions of war. When peace rules there will, be
a. thousand and onÂ» demands and resources de
velcped of which we have no thought now. At
Shanghai J2t3O.(XiO,OO0 measures the tradÂ«Â» of the
Vang-tse Valley with the outside world, and
yet Its development has only begun.
When you have a Held of trade before you
the question becomes one of methods to t>e em
ployed. Speaking to Individual firms. I would
say first, send out the head man of the firm.
The field must be considered not only as to
trade conditions but also along political lines,
and It takes a larsr- man to be equal t o it.
You must send a man who can get In touch
with the people, who will be welcomed at the
clubs end who Is able to meet public officials
and leafilns merchants on an equal footing.
The next fact to be remembered Is that the
product offered must be the thing wanted and
In the form, in the package, that U desired.
Those people are Intensely conservative and
will take a thing If presented la their way
and, will not take It In any other.
To consider the Philippine Question from an
entirely practical standpoint, take the Island
of Luzon alone. It Is twice as resourceful as
Java, out of which the Dutch have realized so
much. The Dutch have made a garden of Java
and the whole of Holland has been enriched.
In all of the Far East countries populations
are increasing. Those peoples have already de
veloped an annual trade with forelg-n nations
of f4400.ooo.noo. Onlj- a very small part of that
trade belongs to the United States. Yet we
are not shut off from it If we should enter the
fMd vi-orouslv.
The development of the flour trade with the
Orient has been a revelation to our people and
shows the possibilities in other lines. A few
years ago Kour was unknown, even to hl&h
class Chinese. To-day we are selling $5,000,000
worth of flour annually to the Chinese, and
have only scratched the surface.
ment of the last year. It is extremely grati
fying also to see now that not only San Fran
cisco but the cities of the East are deeply In
terested In the commercial possibilities that the
Pacific offers for the future.
FORMER MINISTER BARRETT DISCUSSES
PRACTICAL PHASES OF ORIENTAL TRADE
SOME OF THE HCCTDEXTS, OF
THE BREAK FOR LIBERTY
AT THE MAIL DOCK.

and in guiding the strange Chinese fror
where they struck the street to safety i
Chinatown.
The Chinese were not long gone before
Customs officials, men from the Chinese
Bureau and employes of the steamship
company were after them. The steamship
company is penalized to the extent of $501
for every Chinese under detention who
escapes, hence a keen interest was taken
In the search. Captain Anderson, the
WHILE nearly one hundred
Chinese sang songs and made
night hideous with the help of
an Impromptu orchestra, a
few of the more daring pried
two boards oft the side of the detention
loft at the Mail dock late Monday night
and eight of the candidates for deporta
tion gained the freedom of the street by
means of a rope and an adjoining shed.
The escape took place eoon after Wil
tem Borreo went on watch at 11:30 Mon
day night- lie was on duty on the stair
way leading., up to where the Chinese
sleep and Matthew Somarl, an employe of
the steamship company, was on^duty in
the loft with tho Chinese, The'Chin-se
wtre making merry for some reason that
did not appear until later, when It was
found that while they raised riot two
panels in the wall of a closet had been
broken out, leaving a hole through which
the Chinese could crawl to the roof of the
wharf shed. From the shed on the other
Bide there was a rope hanging into an ad-
Joining yard and it was not hard to reach
the street from where the fugitives
dropped to the ground. It was very
feggy and once on the street they had no
difficulty in eluding detection, until they
were lost In the mazes of Chinatown.
It was not until the panels had been
pried off and the noise had ceased that
Somarl began to suspect something. ThÂ»
Chinese had sought their bunks, but the
bunks usually occupied were empty and
so the watchman commenced to Investi
gate. It took him but a few minutes to
n"nd the broken panel and as soon as he
did so he called Borreo and together they
counted their charges. They were eight
short.
It was evidently the intention of the
wily Chinese to slip out one by one into
the small room with the broken panels
and then to scramble out on the roof of
the shed, over the ridge to the other side
or around by way ot a coal tramway
along the eaves to where the rope hung
down, then a drop to the ground, a climb
over a fence or two and into the street
and away. It was a well arranged plan
and there must have been plenty cf out-
These complaints were examined and in
vestigated by Immigration Comimtssioner
Powderly, and acting upon his recom
mendation. Secretary Gage ordered a few
days ago the summary dismissal of
Watchman Borreo and the appointment
of some other person in nis place. Borreo
was notified by Acting Couector Jackson
at 1 o'clock Monuay afternoon that he
had been dismissed, and that Mason S.
Blackburn, his successor, would report
for duty last night.
Government employes Interested in tho
Chinese exclusion act were in the habit of
visiting Chinatown. Borreo was seen to
pass a paper into a Chinese store and the
inference of the officials making the com
plaint was that Borreo was acting as a
paid messenger between the Chinese im
migrants in the detention shed at the Mail
dock and their friends in Chinatown.
Then the captain grot hold of two more
he was sure were of the eight and he
proceeded to take them along with him.
He was hailed by a friend on his wa>
down the street. "What's the matter?
sung out the frelnd. "I'm short a few
Chinamen down my way," the captain
called back, "and I'm making them up."
But he was wrong again, for both of his
prizes were men out on bonds to await
decisions in their cases. He is still on the
hunt, however, and it will not be the
fault of the captain, if he has not at least
his full number of Chinamen, If not the
or.es who escaped in Monday night's fog.
William Borreo was on his last night of
service alter his summary dismissal by
order of the Secretary of the Treasury
wben the Chinese escaped. Borreo's dis
missal was based on a complaint filed
with the Secretary^ of the Treasury by
Supervising Special Treasury Agent
Chance, who visited this city a few
months ag-o, and received an official reÂ»
port that Borreo and one or two other
dockreaster, headed the hunt. He knows
every Chinese who has ever come into tht
city Dy way of the Mail dock and he was
sure he could find some, if not all, tha
escapes. He hunted through Chinatown

TAMMANY AS PURIFIER
NO feature of the reform movement which is now
agitating New York is more interesting tlrtin
the part taken in it by Tammany. Just before
leaving for Europe Boss Croker called the Tammany
executive committee together and procured the ap
pointment of a committee of investigation to inquiry
into the extent to which vice is carried on in the city,
and to devise means for suppressing it wherever
found. The antics of that committee are now oc
cupying much of the attention of the town, ani
while some persons mock at the proceedings as a farce,
others denounce them as fraudulent attempts to mis
lead the public by setting up a false issue in place of
the real one. ,
There is a dispute as to the cause of the action of
the boss. Croker claims to have been prompted by
Ifidor Strauss, who represents a society that is en
gaged in trying to improve the condition of the
poorer classes in the city, but it is generally believed
his action was forced by the letter of Bishop Potter
to Mayor Van Wyck. It is noted that Croker met
the Tammany chiefs in council on the evening of the
very day on which the Bishop's letter was sent to the
Mayor, and the coincidence of time is so striking thai
one can hardly refrain from believing the letter had
more effect upon the boss than had the pleadings of
Mr. Strauss.
Be that as it may, it is certain the Tammany com
mittee has set out upon a programme totally different
from that designed by the Bishop and demanded by
public indignation, and it is that fact more than any
thing else that gives an interest to the actions of the
committee.
It is characteristic of Croker that even in begin
ning a reform movement he undertakes to assail re
formers. Thus he declares that for the vice now pre
vailing in New York Dr. Parkhurst is responsible.
In an interview the day after the appointment of his
committee he said: "The one man responsible for
vice in the city of New York is Dr. Parkhurst He
scattered the women from !one > district all over the
*city, and even in Brooklyn. If it was not for him
there would be no cry from the east side or the west
side or any other part of the dty from decent people.
Instead of trying to discount other people's efforts
he should look to his own dirty work."
The Brooklyn Eagle admits there is a quality' of
truth in* the charge that the crusade of Parkhurst
against vice had the effect of scattering the social
evil from the tenderloin throughout the city and dif
fusing it in the tenement districts, but points out that
the real issue at present is not the existence of vice,
but Tammany's v relation to it and the protection given
to it by city officials. The Eagle says: "The case is
the partnership of Pay and Protection between Gov
ernment and Crime. That prevailed when Dr. Park
hurst made his. crusade. .It ceased while W. L. Strom?

trader will have to secure the services of

her in the Superior Court.
Every attempt hitherto made to provide for high
way improvements by the State has disclosed the fact
that there are'many conflicting interests to be taken
into consideration and many differences of opinion to
be harmonized. Whether the bill of Senator Smith
will prove satisfactory to all these diverse elements
remains to be. seen. It is, however, unquestionably
a step in the right direction. In some counties in
California we have excellent roads, but throughout
the State at large our roads are so defective a3 to im
pose a heavy tax j upon farmers and entail a great loss
of energy and time upon all who have to haul their
produce over any considerable distance to market.
Senator Smith's bill ; is an earnest effort to-rid the
State of these evils and merits the careful considera
tion of all citizens.
The bill deals elaborately with the methods to be
pursued in levying the special tax or in issuing the
bonds, and every care has apparently been exercised
to guard against anything that might be prejudicial
to the interests of the district, the county or the tax
payers.
The bill provides the means by which any portion of,
â¢ county not contained in a permanent road division
may be formed into such a division, and the meth
ods by which the residents may then proceed to the
establishment of permanent highways, by petition to
the Supervisors. It is required that the petition 'shall
set forth an estimate of the probable cost of the work,
the materials to be used and the manner of construct
ing or repairing, a request for a specified sum from
the general road fund and from the district fund, and
a request that a special tax be levied or that bonds
of the division be issued to raise the balance neces
sary for the work. ,
The main purpose of the bill, as stated by the
author, is to provide a way by which funds may be
raited for the construction of a given section of per
manent road. The plan proposed is to take something
from the general road fund of the county, something
from the district road fund, and. then raise the bal
ance by special tax or by bonding. The character of
the road to be constructed is to be determined at an
early stage in the proceedings, so as to enable the
voter to know what he may expect for his money
when he goes to the polls to vote upon the question
of special tax or bonds.
The bill is defined "An act to provide for the or
ganization and government of permanent road divi
sions and defining the manner in which funds may
be raised and expended for the construction, improve
ment and maintenance of permanent roads within this
State."
HIGHWAY improvement is an issue of so much
importance to nil parts of California it is grati
fying to note that further efforts are to be
made in the way of providing for such improvements
at the coming session of the Legislature. Senator
Smith of the Thirty-fourth District has already T pre
pared a bill for that purpose, and has very wisely sub
mitted it for general disiJussion before the Legislature
meets in order that it may be fully understood and
an ample support obtained for it, upon its merits.

and his friend, Jean Paleologne, the designer of posters signed "Pal."
have been talking- to the reporters. By the -way, Faleolosrue talks ten
languages and swears in eleven. They were breakfasting when the early
newspaper man located them.
"Say to your newspaper that I not come herÂ© to catch heiresses." tha
Count said. "New York cannot be a busy place, since every onÂ« has so much
time to jossip."
"Gossip," corrected Mr. Paleologue.
"To gossip," the Count repeated. "Yes, I come hero ln pursuit of some
thing, but not of heiresses. That which I catch was some champagne drinkers.
"All the nobility of France works now," he sighed. VWhv do they work?
Because they have to. Yes, all the nobility of the France works." and his eves
fell upon a distinguished-looking waiter who had Just entered tha room with ja
bunch of finger bowls.
"That which I sell was champagne," he exclaimed vehemently. "I sell him ln
gross or by tho case, by the ehipful; but my title of Countâ that never was in
the market. All that was some gospel." ___^
"Gossip," corrected Mr. Paleolcgue.
"That was some gossip," the Count repeated. "1 hate your ways. You say in
your papers that I have coma. here to/see a young lady which was rich. What
â¢was the result? Although I much appreciate her I cannot call upon her just be
cause of that crosaup."
"Gossip," said Mr. Paleologue.
"That word," the Count said\vehemently. "I only learn him to-day. In tho
France we have more of that word and more of that thing. Hers I stay three
months, most of those months ln New York, where I have friends."
"Did your cousin, Count Bonl, give you any Introductions?" was the next
Question.
The artist and the Count both exploded. Their lips curled with a curl of scorn
after they had wildly gesticulated.
"Count Ademar belongs to the real Castellane family, thÂ© elder branch," said
the artist. "Count Boni is an outsider, a rank lobster."
"It haa been reported," said Count Ademar, "that I have say American girl3
were worth marrying only for their money. Please put it in your newspaper that
this were not a truth.
"Miss Bacon, the namÂ» of which was -mention, fails to be so very rich. In
France were many womans much richer. Every time a French nobleman speaks
to an American girl every one says ha was wanting the money.
"It are not true. Miss Bacon, by example, had no riches, except that which
her father gives to her, and he is still somewhat young and does not-reg-ard Ilka
one which dies very soon."
It had been reported that Mr. Paleologueâ who Is of noble descent hlmsei',
having a barony which he received from the Roumanian Government ln ex
change for one of his original drawingsâ is also here to offer himself in the
American matrimonial market.
"It's about as true as thÂ© story of the Count's plans," he paid. "I'll tell you
why we are here if you want to know." He lowered his voice to a whispar and
% added: "Count Ademar Is here to sell champagneâ I'm herÂ© to drink It."
\ But the gossips still maintain that Count Aderaar has sworn to wed and that
he has brought tho artist along to act as best man.

\\ R. PHELAN in his last campaign for Mayor
j \ had a slogan which he used on all occasions
â¢ * and to all audiences. It was his constant cry
that the new charter must be put in operation by its
friends. Upon this he rung all the changes. The
charter was an orphan and needed him as a guar
dian.
Weil, the charter is in the hands of it? friends.
Manipulated by them it is giving San Francisco
probably the worst government it ever had. From
the Civil Service Commission to the School Board
favoritism, tyranny, oppression, disregard of merit
and respect for the political pull and push are ap
parent on every side. Never before in the history of
the cuy has everything been so dependent on parti
sanship. ItÂ« influence is felt from the teachers in the
School Department to the paupers that shiver out
side the almshouse. One of the latter, old, forlorn,
indigent, in distress and with none upon whom to de
pend, when told that he should swallow his pride and
go to the almshouse, dejectedly answered that he had
tried to get into the poorhousc but failed because he
"had no pull." So, "in the hands of its friends," the
new charter has put up places in the schools and
places in the poorhouse, to be pulled down by the
pull of politicians.
It is also true that wherever the letter and spirit
of the charter interfere with the patronage and profit
of the Mayor's office-holders it is evaded or attacked
in the courts.
These friends of the charter have not scrupled to
tnke advantage of the infirmities of that instrument
Â¦whenever their personal interests may be served.
They made it, carried it through at the polls and arc
responsible for whatever defects it exhibits.
But the people who were led to believe that the
charter would guide them directly into a self
cpor.iting. automatic, municipal elysium, are being
turely undeceived. In the Mayor's organization of
the government they find ignorance, weakness and
0reed in a portentous partnership that bodes no good
tr> the fortune of the city.
FRIENDS OF THE CHARTER.
have been annoying without yielding any consider
able revenue to the Government, and it is to be hoped
nothing will prevent the proposed revision at an early
date.
The country will of course be gratified with so large
a reduction in taxes, .and "particularly of those that
It is known that the brewers, the express compa
nies and the telegraph companies are seeking for a
repeal of taxes affecting their business, and they do
not stand alone by any means. Washington dis
patches forecasting the report of the committee state:
"It is understood that in addition to reductions here
tofore mentioned the increase of 60 cents per thou
sand on cigars will be removed, also that the stamp
tax on steamship tickets will be taken off, because
the revenue received does not justify the difficulties of
collection. Members of the committee have been
asked to remove the stamp taxes on foreign bills of
exchange nnd bills of lading, and it is possible that
that matter may be reopened. The most important
changes in the present law. will be schedule B, which
practically will be wiped out, and which includes
medicines and proprietary articles. The tax also prob
ably will be removed from conveyances, mortgages,
etc These, with the abolishment of taxes on express
receipts, telegrams, bank checks and some other
stamp taxes will, it is said, secure the reduction of
$30,000,000, which Is the amount agreed upon by the
treasury officials and the committee."
', The prospect that reductions would be made has of
course brought on a contest among varied inter
ests,, each seeking to profit by it. Congress will find
it difficult to withstand the influences brought to bear
to relieve each interest of the tax imposed upon it.
It is probably due to that pressure that the estimates
of reduction have increased so rapidly, and it is also
probable the fight may have the effect of involving'
the whole subject in such conflict that after all it will
be found advisable to postpone the reductions until
the next Congress, when a complete and systematic
revision of the act may be made.
PROPOSED TAX REDUCTIONS.
' ZIJ STI MATES of tax reductions to be made in the
, war revenue act at the coming session of Con
â* gress will follow one another rapidly, and each
successive one promises a larger reduction than its
predecessor. Forecasts of Congressional action is
sued immediately after the election were to the effect
that hardly anything in the way of reduction wouH
be attempted this winter. A little later came' reports
that the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee
of the House had intimated there would probably be
a reduction to the extent of $15,000,000. Next it was
announced that the Secretary of the Treasury esti
mated there might be a reduction of $20,000,000, and
now dispatches from Washington report that a-sub
committee of the Ways and Means has about reached
the conclusion that the taxes can be safely reduced to
as much as $30,000,000.

Yet with all this effort the destruction increases
yearly. In our dry summers reckless seekers for.
pleasure or pelf in our mountains leave a fiery track
behind them. Every year these destroyers of the
birthright of a generation to come are the agents in
the destruction of as much timber as commerce
would demand in five years.
Their acts are highly criminal. What would we do
to a man who was detected in imprisoning a single
human being, to die in the torments of thirst, without
water? It is highly probable that the law would not
be permitted to take its course with him, but he would
be summarily punished. Yet that is what these sum
mer incendiaries, these guilty of forest arson, arc
doing every year, not to one but to many. They am
destroying that on which human life depends. They
are drying up the spring. They are taking from the
soil its fertility, so that it will respond no more to
seedtime and harvest. They are preparing for the
future depopulation of the country by causing it' to
cease supporting life. They are robbing the bird of
its song and the blossom of its perfume.
How long will their crime go unpunished and the
forests go unprotected?
The press has not been delinquent. American
journalism has for many years sought to spread
abroad information on this subject of the highest use
fulness to the people. Various societies and organi
zations all over the country have taught the relation
of fertility to moisture in the soil, and the relation of
moisture to protection of the soil against evaporation,
by a covering of forage and forest.
npHE union of a forest and irrigation policy was
I first effected in California. There is here a so
ciety organized for the purpose of preserving
the forests and promoting the storage of flood waters
for irrigation. This society will likely be heard from
during the coming session of the Legislature. The
National Irrigation Congress, following this Califor
nia example, has concreted its purpose into the terse
expression, "Save the forests and store the floods."
Perhaps nothing is more difficult than to get men to
see their interest in the equilibrium of nature. Given
her way, nature provides for all forms of life. But
when her equilibrium is disturbed by artifice, life suf
fers. Under natural conditions the country west of
the ninety-ninth meridian bore an abundant crop of
the most nutritious forage. Its deep springs were un
failing, and its watercourses were never dry. Great
herds of wild ruminating animals ran on the plains
and in the mountains and fattened on the natural pas
ture. The floods were in effect stored in the soil by
its vegetable cover. To this purpose the grasses and
wild clovers were as fitted in their place as were the
dense forests. The grass cover and roots stored
water on the plains just as effectively as did the
columnar trees and their roots and the forest floor in
the mountains. In fact, nature's plan was a well ad
justed harmony, and her provision for caring for the
small rainfall of the arid region was perfect. Given
natural conditions where the annual rainfall is only
four to ten inches, and the annual evaporation is from
thirty-six to seventy-two inches, the soil of the plains
must be covered with vegetation to resist evapora
tion, and let the water go into the soil instead of back
into the air. Upon this symmetrical arid beneficial
scheme man intrudes to destroy its adjustment. Act
ing as if he were born yesterday and would die to
morrow, leaving nothing human to succeed him, he
proceeds to strip the plains of their forage and the
mountains of their forests. When his ax and saw
cannot do the work fast enough he applies the torch,
becomes an incendiary, practically burns down his
own house and makes his own field barren, and then
deplores misfortunes that he brings upon himself.
It is well that the National Irrigation Congress, the
California Waters and Forests Society and the Cali
fornia club of ladies pull together for forestry and irri
gation; but, pull as they may, the interference with
the equilibrium of nature will cease only when the
American masses are taught better than they know
now. When they learn that the useless extermination
of a single blade of. grass and the wanton destruction
of a single trc"e has an important relation to the wel
fare of man, they may cease to inflict damage upon
themselves by a willful waste of the resources of na
ture.

it is not Improbable that Christianity will
have to treat It with respect, and even

already won in the civilization of the
Orient.. In saying this one does not Imply
that Confucianism is superior to Chris

Christianity can never become- the domi

meant Is that Christianity muÂ« recognize
and make peace, so to speak, with what
there is in Confucianism of permanent

PRETTY LITTLE JOSXE
WILL WANDER NO MORE
eling Proves lier Un

A Bright Maid's Penchant for Trav-
Josle Andrich. a pretty little girl who
has a wandering disposition, will ramble
away from home no more. Through the
efforts of Secretary White of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
Josle, has been placed In a local charity
Institution.
The young maid has resided with her
father at 81 Natoma street, but horne has
no fascination for her. She has availed
herself of every opportunity to travel, and
was often founfl in distant parts of the
city. "When nUht overtook her the brave

Josle began her wanderings when she
was 7 years of age. No amount of scold
ing or chastisement would correct her pe
culiar habit. Policemen had no terrors for
the little girl. She was often picked up
by the blueooats and restored to her anx
ious relatives, but as soon as her parents'
backs were turned she would steal away
and enjoy sightseeing.
On Sunday la.it Josle decided to go forth
again and observe the conditions of the
city during the â¢ holiday period. While
meandering down Third street she fell in
with the little daughters of a Mrs. Laurie,
who resides at 4 Elizabeth street. She ac

In the meantime Chief Sullivan's min

pretty wanderer, but without success.
Some kindly person notified Secretary
White of the child's whereabouts, and in
company with Officer McMurray he in
vestigated the case. They took Josle in
charge and notified her father. The latter
said he could do nothing with his little
wanderer, and at his request the girl will
be placed in an Institution that is opposed

BY ALBERT 8. BOLLES, LLD.
As an employer is required to furnish
safe appliances, etc., this rule requires of
him in many cases to Inspect the things
that are to be used by his employes be
fore they are put into service. What Is
the nature of this inspection? In one of
the cases the rule was applied to a rail
road company with respect to a chain
used on Its cars. The case arose in Michi
gan, and the Supreme Court of the State
said: "It not only can, but Its duty re
quires that it shall, before It is placed on
a car, cause every link of every chain
used by ita employes in places or under
circumstances involving danger in case
the chain should break, to bÂ« carefuUy
tested and^Inspected by some one compe
tent to Judge of its fitness for the utmost
strain that is likely to come upon It."
The New York Rule.
This rule, however, did not find favor
with the courts of New York, and so the
Court of Appeals adopted another to the
effect that reliance may be had on the
maker that an article Is proper. If It is
bought of a reputable maker that is a suf
ficient guarantee of its quality to dispense
with any other test. The importance of
the rule will Justify adding some of the
remarks of the court. The case related
to an injury that happened to an employe
from the breaking of a hook he was using
in lifting a girder. There was nothing on
the surface of the hook to show that it
was weak; in truth, the break resulted
from a hidden defect in the iron. When
it was purchased the employer supposed
he was buying a hook of the best quality.
The court remarked that a master could
procure tools for servants in several
ways. He could buy them ready made or
a dealer, have them made or buy the
materials and make them himself. His
'â¢liability for an injury resulting from, a
defect In the materials of a tool will be
determined by the same rule In each
case." In the present case the employer
was obliged to rely on the dealer and
manufacturer for the quality of materials
used. A hook ready for use could neither
be cut nor bent ever an anvil without im
pairing its strength or perhaps destroying
it altogether. "A test of that character
applied to one of a lot would be no guar
antee of the quality of the others. To
apply such a test, therefore, to tools pro
cured in that way is Impracticable, and
such articles are not usually tested before
they are put in use. The modern indus
trial system rests upon confidence In oth- ;
ers." The court then turns to railroads,
and declares that they cannot well apply
such tests to the materials of which their
cars and engines are made, or to the rails
which form their tracks. Reasonable In
spection only was required. "But when
articles are manufactured by a process
approved by use and experience and ap
parently properly finished and stamped it
is not usual for them to be tested again
in quality, and such examinations are not,
generally required by law. If materials
of the best quality are purchased -and
tools constructed trom them by compe- 1
tent and skillful workmen; If there Is
nothing in the appearance of the material
to Indicate Inefficiency, men in the or
dinary affairs of life use them and place
them in the hands of their servants, and
thero were no circumstances surrounding
the manufacture of the hook in question
to induce a prudent man to-' depart from
the usual course, or to adopt extraor
dinary care and precaution."
The court goes on to remark that all the
best iron and steel is made by a few con
cerns, and that In the trial of the case it
was shown that all practicable tests were
applied during the process of making
things. "If the best renned Iron Is re
quired, the purchaser may assume that
the tests necessary to produce that article
have been properly made and the work
properly d<vie.
The Michigan and NÂ«-w York Rules.
This view of an employer's duty greatly
differs from that previously stated by the
Supreme Court of Michigan. By that rule
an employer must do his own testing
Â¦whenever it can be done; by the Mew-
York rule he can rely on another. "\VÂ»
aro not so certain as the Court of AppÂ«als
that the hook in question could not have
been tested in other ways than by cutting
or bending it. It .appears that the hook
broke when used in lifting a girder, and
its ordinary u?e suggests at once an easy
mode of testing itâ namely, to apply
weight. Hov/ much ought the hook to
support? Did the maker apply this test?
There is no evidence to show that he did.
The New York rule may be right with
the qualification that in every case it
must be shown that the maker or sailer
properly tested the thing sold.
The Federal Bule.
The view of an employer's duty declared
by the Supreme Court of the United States
differs somewhat from both views above
given. "It is net necessarily the duty of a
purchaser of machinery, whether simple
cr complicated, to tear it to pieces to see
if there bo some latent defect. If he pur
chases from a manufacturer of recog
nized standing he is justified in assuming
that In the manufacture proper care was
taken and that proper tests were made of
the different parts of the machinery, and
that, as delivered to him. It is in a fair
and reasonable condition for use. We do
not mean to say that It is never the duty
of a purchaser to make tests or examin
ations of his own cr that he can always
and wholly rely upon th* assumption that
the manufacturer has fully and sufficient
ly tested. It may be, and doubtless often
is, his duty when placing the machine In
actual use to subject It to ordinary tests
for determining its strength ana effi
ciency."
The. Illinois Rule.
Two other views may be given slightly
differing from these. The Illinois view is
this: "When employers have, so far as the
employment cf reasonable skill and ex
perience enables them, employed experi
enced, skillful and prudent servants in the
use of their machinery, have selected good
and safe machinery, so far as known and
well recognized .test can determine, con
structed of proper material, free from de
fects so far as like tests will disclose,
neither reason nor Justice requires that
they should be held liable for Injuries that
may result."
The Pennsylvania Rule.
By the Pennsylvania rule "it may be
considered as now settled that if a person
employs others, not as servants but as
mechanics or contractors In an Indepen
dent business, and they are of rood char
acter, if there was not want of due care
in choosing them, he incurs no liability
for injuries to others. from their negli
gence or want of skill. If I employ a well
known and reputable machinist to con
struct a steam engine and It blows up
from bad materials and unskillful work
I am not responsible for any Injftry which
may result, whether to my own servant
or to a third person." â¢ . - Â¦
The Rules Compared.
These varying rule3 are now competing
for adoption by the courts of other States.
The Michigan rule requires employers to
test their appliances carefully before giv
ing them to their employes to usÂ©. The
Illinois rule also requires tests to be made
such as are well recojmlzed; the New
York rule is that purchases from reputa
ble dealers or builders will suffice and no
tests are required of the employer, and
the Pennsylvania rule accords with this
view. The Federal rule is peculiar. It
adopts both views. In other words, an
employer can rely. on the reputation of a
purchaser in some cases; in others hÂ«
must test the quality and strength of the
appliance or other thing to be used by the
employe, but throws not the faintest glim
mer of light on the cases on whtch tests
must be made. - The Federal rule leaves
all In the dark, each case must be deter
mined by Itselfâ whether a test ought to
have been made or whether thÂ© empldyer
was justified in trusting to- the reputa
tion of the seller.
. In the case wherein the Federal court
applied this rule a railroad employer was
injured by the explosion of the boiler of
an engine. .Though the court does not
say directly that the company ought to
have inspected the engine bef oreÂ» usin,r
it. it conveys the idea that It ought to
have done so and that this was done.
The Inspection of Foreign Cars.
The courts have had no little difficulty
in answering - another question, namely
what inspection ought to be made by a
railroad company of cars belonging to an-
other line that are received for tfca pur
pose of moving them over its own road.
Kvery one knows that this is a matter of
daily occurrence among railroad com
panies. The first thing to be noced In an
swering this question is the difference
between foreign cars that are Imperfoct
because they are not in good condition
and foreign cars that are imperfect be
cause they are faulty In construction for
use on another railroad than the one for
which they were madei Thus cars may
be perfectly adapted to their own road,
yet be very Imperfect for use on, another
because they have different coupling ap
pliances or are so much higher t&at they
cannot ba coupled with others only with
great difilcuUy or by using an unusual
coupler.
When a Foreign Car Need Not Be
Received.
A foreign car not In good condition need
cot bo received by another road; to this
rule all tha courts agree. If It is received,
what then? In New York, Vermont and
cozve other States the courts aray that the
receiving road is bound by tha sajne rule
that applies to it with respect to one of
Its own cars. Thus In the case of Gottlieb
agulnst a New York railroad Mr. Juatic*
Karl said that it was bound to Inspect for
eign, cars Just as it would its own. '"It
owes the duty of Inspection as master, and
is at least responsible for the conse
quences of such defects as would be dis
closed or discovered by ordinary inspec
tion. When cars come to it which have
defects visible or discoverable by ordin
ary inspection, it must either remedy such
defects or refuse to take such cars; so
much, at least, is due from it to its em
ployes. The employes can no more be said
to assume the risk of such defects in. for
eign cars than in cars belonging to the
company. Aj to such defects tile duty of
the company is tho same as to all cars
drawn over its road." This rule is dear
in th* States where it exists. All cars ara
regarded as alike, foreign or otherwise.
with respect to defects that may bÂ« dis
covered oy ordinary inspection. And If
such are run, thÂ© company la responsible
to Its employes for the consequences.
The Role in
Â¦ in Massachusetts and some other States
a different rule has been laid down, that
of inspection and nothing more. Thus, In
the case of Mack In against the Boston and
Albany Railroad the court declared that
while the obligation of drawing cars over
its road would not extend to t!aosÂ« teat
were unsafe, yet If they were recurved tb<s
railroad's duty did not consist la rarnlsh
lns Â¦ proper means for service, ta other
words, proper cars, but simply taÂ» duty
of inspection. Morewver this dnty In that
State is performed by employing enough
and competent inspectors who are to act
under proper superintendence and rales.
These inspectors are regarded as engaged
in a common employment with the brake
men of the cars inspected while In transit.
By this rule, therefore, a foreign car that
is defective reed not do received, but if
it Is passed by the inspector, and Injury
follows to some of thÂ» employes, a brake
man, for example, he has so redres* be
cause both are. In the sam* common ser
vice-
Is not this conclusion a plain violation
cf another rule, that an employer must
provide suitable appliances, etc., for his
employes, and though he may delegate- the
duty of selecting them to another, yet the
employer Is responsible for hta neglljyisnoe
in dote? th!a and can In no way escape
from It. Surely iLjs an overthrow. In part,
of this primary rulÂ«.
Foreign Cars That Are Imperfect In
Construction.
Turning now to the other rnje that
holds tha receiving company liable as
though the cars were Its own. It seems at
first as thmierh an employe had some
chance of redress If hÂ» werÂ» injured by a
defect In such a car; but his chanc* soon
disappears by the application of another
rule, already considered, that an employer
is not liable for risks tnat ar% known by
the Â«mployÂ« and taken by continuing at
his post, and especially when he ffives no
notice of his discovery. Whtta, therefore.
there is a wide difference In form between
these rules, in effect the employer escapes
in nearly every case from liability tinder
either of them.
Let us pass to the recervtngr of foreign
cars, that are Imperfect simply because
they are constructed in a different man
ner from those of the reeelvm* company.
These must be received; the law is Im
perative, and the risk from attempting to
couple them and otherwise manage them
while In the possession of the receiving
company Is ono of the risks assumed by
the employes. Said the Suprema Court of
the United States, when applying this
principle In a ease Drought by an em
ploye of the Wabash Railroad Company,
who was Injured In coupling: a foreign
car: "It Is not pretended that theso cars
were out of repair, or in a defective condi
tion, but simply that they were construct
ed differently from the "WabajJi cars In
that they had doublÂ© deadwoods or bump
ers of unusual length to protect the draw
.bars. But all this was obvious to even a
pasgin? glance, and the rial: which there
was in coupling: such cars was. apparent.
It required no special akin or knowtedse
to detect it. The intervenor was no boy.
placed by the employer In a position of
undisclosed dancer, but a mature man, do

AN EMPLOYER'S -DUTY TO MAKE INSPECTION
There la every possibility that Califor
nia will be honored by having a battleship
named after her. The weight. of influence
brought to bear on the President and Sec
retary of the Navy by the Chamber of
Commerce of San Francisco la beginning
to brinar about the desired result. Tho
representatives of this State in the upper
and lower houses of Congresa have cotn r
blned and are putting forth their effort*
to secure the coveted honor.
In the early part of the present monih
it became known to the local organization
that-U was the intention of the Navy De
partment to give the name California to
one of the new armored cruisers. While
the . residents of this State appreclatod
the great honor they deemed themselves
entitled to a battleship. Rather than have
the name of the Golden State on the
prow of the cruiser many were willing to
beg to be excused. When the board of
trustees of the local Chamber of Com
merce met on November 13 resolutions
were adopted and forwarded to tho Cali
fornia representatives at Washington.
The resolutions went on to say that it
has been customary to name battleships
after the States of the Union, and whl!e
appreciating that this cruiser would be
perhaps in size and cost equal to a battle
ship she would not be, nor 13 she intended
to be, equal In fighting ability. The reso
lution further stated:
VÂ»> feel certain that the State of California,
not alone for Its great extent of territory, but
also from its vast resources, natural advantage*,
commerce and trade, and facing as it does the
awakening Orient, Is fully entitled to have its
name given to a ship which shall be in all re
epecta at least the equal of any afloat: there
fore the Chamber of Commerce of San Fran-
. Resolved. That we hereby most respectfully
request the honorable the Secretary of the
N'avy to hold back the name California until
such time as It can t*s given to a battleship
which shall be second to none, and we earnest
ly aslc the members of the California delegation
In Congress to Join with us In this our humble
request to the honorable the Secretary of the
Navy.
Secretary Scott of the Chamber of Com
merce was instructed to pen a letter to
Secretary Long and stt forth the views
of the organization. That he carried out
his instructions was evidenced by the fol
lowing: letter, which he received from the
Navy Department yesterday:

NEW TORK. Nov. 27.â Selling to take profit
again ovtrcame the market to-day and the
general level of etock prices is lower than lt
Â¦mas last night. The day's net changes, which
are fractional except in a few stocks. Rive
no idea of the wide movement cf prices during
the day nor of the notable strength shown at
times by a few stocks. This Is due to the
fact tfiat the market was generally strong In
tfce early dealings and was only carried be-low
last nlgtit's level by a very sharp reaction,
which also reduced the eains of the strong
etocke. The notably strong points were in the
coalers. Southern Hallway preferred. Baltimore
and Ohio, Southern Pacinc and the American
f melting stocks. The movement In the coal
e;s r.as helped by the wintry weather re
ported. The movement caused the revival of
eld rumors of consolidation or change of con
trol, the effect being notably manifest In New
Jersey Central, which rose 6 points to 149, re
acting 1H- The business In the group was
eruall except In the Readings, which reflected
very heavy and concentrated buying. The
first preferred rose at one time 2% and closed
& point lower. Large buying continued of
{Southern Railway preferred and rumors con
tinued of a coming Increase of dividend and
a dissolution of the voting trust. This was
about the only stock except the Denver and
lilo Grande of yesterday's strong group which
held out to-dey. The American Smelting stock
rose 2% and 1% for the common and preferred
en talk of the absorption of the principal com
peting Interest. International Power rose 4
points without explanation. Shortly before ths
close, very large buying of Southern Pacific
came Into force, the Individual transactions
running from one to six thousand shares and
lifted the stock 2 points. During tie early
part cf the day when the general market was
strong the eteel and copper etocks were weak.
The Bte*"l stocks showed a disposition to rally,
especially Ste*I and Wire, which got above
44 at one time. The stock closed unchanged.
AmeJr&mated Copper was very heavily sold
and late In the day fell to &4H and cloned
with a net lcÂ«s of %. The general reaction
In the market was not accompanied by any
unfavorable development In* the general con
ditions, but to disappointment of some specu
lative expectations. The principal of these was
that to-day'e London Stock Exchange settle
ment would deveiop a very heavy short In
terest In America. On the contrary It was
chown that quite a large long account existed
In America and that London sold stocks her*
lor the new account. Another speculative as
ruaflcn was that Chicago and the West had
been prevented yesterday by the Interruption
of. wire communications from buying stocks
Gas and Electric continued the leading stock j
In point of activity on the momins session of
the Bond Exchange, declining from $48 to J4S 23

ore the close next Friday, was the feature on
:he Board of Trade to-day and, while not
spectacular, was fairly active. For delivery
:hls month corn sold between 49c and Clo and
:losed lc higher at 50o. Private elevators de

IT.e report had no effect on the market as It
is doubtful that the corn can be brought hero
n time for delivery Friday. Phillips . sold

situation in oats. December closed a shade up
at 21T4C.

Ben Butler and Harvard.
The divinity that hedges a Harvard pro
fessor Is beyond the ken of the benitfhte'l
who suffer the disadvantage of living out
side the borders of the Bay State, but it
Is an awesome thing, and It persists be
yond the scaffold and the grave, as Ben
Butler learned at the cost of a degree.
Shortly after the legal removal of Profes
sor Webster for the murder of Dr. Park
man, Butler was badg-pring a Â¦witness in
a very disrespectful manner, when the
court Interposed and said impressively:
"Counsel will remember that the witness
Is a Harvard professor." "Fes, I know
It." coolly rejoined Butler; "we hangeJ
one the other day."

RUT U UN OF THE CUTTER
McCULLOCH FROM NOME
PORT TOWNSEND. Nov. 27.â The rev
enue cutter McCulloch, the last of the rev
enue fleet from the Arctic seas, arrived
to-day direct from Dutch Harbor. The
McCulloch sailed from Nome on October
26. She reports that the steamer Centen
nial towed the disabled steamer Santa
Ana from Nome to Dutch Harbor and will
convey her to this place. The officers or
the McCulloch are of the opinion that the
Santa Ana will reach port in safety, pro
vided she encounters *no severe storms,
which would prove disastrous in her crip
pled condition, two blades of her propeller
being gone.
The steamer Portland sailed from Dutch
Harbor on November 18. She convoyed the
little sldewheel steamer Sadie, bound for
San Francisco, and then proceeded to Pu
get Sound, and should arrive here to-night
or tP-morrow. After leaving Dutch Har
bor the McCulloch encountered three days
of storm of unusual severity.
The cutter brings news that Nome is
now completely - isolated from tho outer
world by a barrier of Ice. For seven long
months this condition of affairs will con
tinue. The camp is well supplied, with
provisions and fuel. It Is possible that
before the first steamers arrive at Nome
in the spring there may be a slight short
age of coal. Â¦ _

ORGANIZE TO FIGHT
LOTTERY AMENDMENT
RENO, New, Nov. 27. â The people of
Reno met en masse to-day to devise
way? and means of organizing the fight
against the lottery amendment, which will
come up before the Legislature next Jan
uary. Allen C. Bragg was chosen chair
man and E. D. Ayers secretary. Judge
Curler moved that pledges be passed
through the audience for- signatures as
follows:
W>. the undersigned, hereby Join the Anti-
Lottery League and pledge ourselves to use
all honorable means at our command to aid
in killing the scheme at the Incoming session
of the Legislature; or falllne in that, to re
double our efforts against It when it is nub
tr.itted to a. vote of the people for ratification.
A motion was made empowering the
chairman to appoint a committee of
twenty-five to organize the light, and
with power to appoint from Its number
or otherwise sub-committees to carry for
wrrd the work of the Anti-Lottery
League in such manner as seemed most
expedient.
Judge Curler in the course of a speech
paid that the corporation the citizens or
Reno had to fight was nothinsr more nor
less than the Louisiana Lotterv Com
pany, and if it once got a foot
hold in the State It would control the elec
tions in every precinct. It would set asldo
from its vast profits a sum to buy votes
and corrupt the politics of this State and
would control every office. It would con
trol the Legislature and the State of
ficers and would see to It that the State
did not grow any in population to make
Its burden heavier. â¢

WASHINGTON. Nov. 27.â The annual
report of the United States Indian In
spector for Indian Territory calls atten
tion to the fact that the Territory, em
bracing nearly 20,000,000 acres, is owned
In common by citizens of the various
tribes, comprising Indians, negroes and
intermarried whites, aggregating 84,753
people, including freeimen. within the
borders of which are located some 350.000
whites or non-citizens who have no title
to property and are without representa
tion in the government of the Territory.
I'ntn the lands are appraised and allotted
by the commission tÂ« the five civilized
tribee. lands in towr.sites disposed of and
tribal go> eminent s have become extinct
certain laws of Arkansas Tare extended
over Indian Territory. Federal laws ap
ply in othf-r Instances and the Secretary
of the Interior is charted by law wich
enforcement of rules ar.d regulations gov
erning other matters. Such a condition
renders affairs so complicated that it i3
not surprising, when courts and eminent
lawyers differ as to tlie proper construc
tion of the law. the people are frequently
at a Iofs to determine what laws apply or
who 1s authorized to erforcr them.
In view of the combined refusal of nor.
dtize&a within the Cbickasaw and Choc
taw nation to comply with the tribal laws
and of the fact' that the only remedy is
to remove them the report recommends
that Congress prescr.be a penalty, the
fame as in the States, for seizure and
sale of property sufficient to pay taxes
due, or thnt some other method be adopt
ed to compel payment of them other than
removing, provided these tribal tax laws
are to be in force for six years hence.
The Governors of the Chlokasaw ani
Choctaw nations recently submitted a
joint communication to the Interior De
partment protesting against the manner
of surveying and platting towns provid
ed in the Indian appropriation act, claim
ing It to be in violation of their agree
ment. Townsite commissions were then
instructed, wherever the towns desired
and it is in the interest of the towns, to
plat a suitable park at Jlu per acre and
that ten acres should be deemed suffi
cient.
Recommenda-tion is made for modifica
tion of section 3 of the Curtis act so as
to authorize the Secretary of the Interior
to Investigate land improvement contracts
and remove non-citizens, giving the latter
the right to appeal to the United States
Court to regain possession. Other recom
mendations are that- the present system
and rate of taxes be superseded by a uni
form system fixed upon non-citizens en
gaged in business to bo collected by rules
and regulations of the Interior Depart
ment and to be used for the common
g-ood: the withdrawal of a sufficient
amount of the Cherokee nation funds
from the I'nited States treasury to pay
all their outstanding Indebtedness, and
additional legislation providing that until
allotment citizens may rent their propor
tion of "agricultural or grazing" land for
such purpose- only.

Sister Sanghamitta to Lecture on the
COUNTESS RETURNS A
PRIESTESS OF BUDDHA
Truths of Buddhism and Life
in the Far East.
The Countess Canavarro, who three
years ago renounced all worldly ties to
become a Buddhist sister, returned yester
day on the Nippon Maru from her stay
In the Orient.
The Countess, who Is now known as
Sister Sanghamitta, comes to spend a
year in the United States, during which
time she will deliver lectures, her object
being to enlighten the people as to th>Â»
truths of Buddhism. During her short
stay in the Far East Sister Sanghamitta
has devoted her time to study and phil
anthropy. She has founded three schools
for girls In Ceylon, where she has alw
established a convent. Aside from the
practical religious work of her order Sis
ter Sanghamitta has translated the "Ab
hidhamma," an ancient work of philoso
phy and psychology, originally writ
ten in Pall, a tongue even more ancient
than the sacred Sanskrit. This transla
tion the Buddhist sister will publish early
next year.
No arrangements for lectures in this
city have as yet been made, but it has
been decided that there are to be several,
and one of them will probably be on th*
Hindoo famine, in the midsÂ»t of which
Sister Sanghamitta has lived.
Previous to the journey to the Orient
Sister Sanghamitta made her homo in
Oakland, and it was through her interest
in the Theosophical Society of this city
that the lady became Interested and
finally converted to Buddhism.

THE DAY'S DEAD.
POSTUM CEREAL
JUSTIFIABLE DECEIT.
little Acts Practiced by "Wives.
The way a Cincinnati woman cured her
husband of the coffee habit by a little by-
play Is worthy of imitation in bad cases.
He tells the tale himself: "For years I
had been using coffee and finally I got like
a morphine or opium fiend. I knew per-
fectly well that coffee robbed me of sleep,
and I would lie awake hour after hour In
the night, throwing away my life practi-
cally, for I needed the sleep to carry on
my work.
"Common eeiise and my knowledge of
the medicinal effects of caffeine (the ac-
tive principle of coffee) told me plainly
enough that I was ruining my life with
every cupful, but to give coffee up was
another question. I pimply could not.
"About three months ago my wife
brought home a sample of Postum Food
Coffee, but I would not hear of It. She
f eld I wu stubborn and hard headed.
No doubt I waj^ but I wasn't myself.
"She apparently gave up the effort to
Induce me to change, and I went on (as
I supposed) with my coffee right along,
five cups a day. About a month after
that I noticed I was sleeping very much
better at night, my nerves were fully fifty
per cent stronger. I drank Just as much
coffee as ever, and was delighted- to think
that It was not the coffee that was hurt-
lag me.
"SpeeJdngr tÂ» xny wife about the change
In my health, I told hÂ«r that there must
be something to my habits that had
changed my healti. for I was bo much
better, and I was glwi to know that 1
CSBld get better and still use coffee. 8he
laughed heartily and said she might as
well let the cat cut of the bag. . She said,
â¢I have been giving you Postum Food
Coffee for a whole month and you have
never known It.'
"The proof was so plain and the Pos-
tum Coffee so good that X. was simply de-
lighted with the whole affair, and, of
course, freely forgave my wife, for the
Justifiable deception. I am getting well
as fast as a man could and am telling
tar friends about It. However, many or
them, like myself, will not hear to any
change, but stick to their coffee, and
complain of headaches, indigestion, eto.
A few of them have been induced- to
make the change from coffee to Postum
Food Coffee, and I have never known a
case where It has not worked a great
adv&nras-e." J, B. Huttenmiller, 113

The Czar sailed from here six months
ago in command of Captain Wagner.
When last heard from she was to sail
from San Bias in ballast for San Fran
cisco. That waÂ« on September 20 and
since then no definite news has been re
ceived until yesterday afternoon. Then
Captain William Ol.fon, the managing
owner, received a dispatch stating that
the Czar had been sighted floating bot
tom up off Cape Calltnte. According to
this she could not have been far from
her starting point when 6he turned turtle
The Czar was 137 tons net burden, 3S
feet lone, 25 feet beam and 9 feet 7 inches
deep. She was built in 1SS1 and at one
"time she was used as a yacht. Captain
Wagner^was well known on the coast.
Some weeks.ago The Call told the story
of a wreck off the Mexican coast and
stated that fears were entertained for tho
safety of the schooner Czar. Later the
Email craft was given up as lost and now
comes a dispatch stating that the
schooner turned turtle and that probably
all hands were drowned.
Th*> Poltalloch was launched from a
Belfast shipyard In 1S93. She is a steel
four-masted bark of 2133 tons net burden,
and when laden carries nearlv 5000 tons
of grain. She is 2*4 feet 4 inches long, 42
feet beam and 24 feet 4 inches deep. Her
managing owners are Potter Bros., of
Liverpool, England. The ship hast been
here on two occasions during the past
seven years, and her captain has a large
circle of friends in San Francisco.

Rosalia for this port, which went
ashore at the north entrance to
Wlllapa Bay at 2 o'clock yesterday morn
ing, willbe a total, loss. Her crew of
thirty men reached shore safely.
The Call correspondent who was dis
patched to the scene of the wreck saw
Captain Younr to-day. According ten. his
story the' disaster was "duo to the rough
weather at the time. Fog settled heav
ily Sunday night, and as the night wore
on it became so dense that it was im
possible to see half a length ahead. Cap
tain Young supposed he was well off
shore, when suddenly, at 2 o'clock, he
found himself in the breakers. One of the
anchors was shipped and the cable of the
other parted. The sea was running very
high and the vessel was rapidly driven
to her doom.
When day broke seventeen of the thirty
men were sent ashorenn small boats, the
others leaving the vessel later. The tug
Astoria put In an appearance early yes
terday morning, when the position of the
hark made It possible tor her to be
floated. The weather was so rough, how
ever, that Captain Olsen. master of tue
tug-, found it impossible to approach near
enough to pass a line, aJthough Cap
tain Young offered him $10,W>0 if he would
do so. All day long Captain Olsen tned
to get near the stranded Britisher, but
each time the waves drove him back, and

The Rev. Aloyslus "Varsi, one of the
pioneer members of the. Society of Jesus
in California, died last evening at 5 o'clock
In the magnificent Hayes-street home of
the society, which he was instrumental in
building. The magnificent pile known as
St. Ignatius College, located on Van Ness
avenue, Hayes, Franklin and Grove
streets. Is a lasting monument to his
labors in the cause to which he devoted
his life work, extending over a period of
more than half a century.
Of all the Jesuit fathers who did so
much to advance the cause of Catholicity
and education on the Pacific Coast Father
Varsi stood most prominent. . It was due
to his persistent efforts that St. Ignatius
Church and College have attained the
prominent positions they now occupy.
Father Varsi became, a .member, of. the
Society of Jesus In the College, of Baiita
Teresa. Cagllari. Island of Sardinia, on
May 2, 1843, he then being 16 years of age.
Noted for his early piety and Inclination
toward the deeper sciences, he followed
his desires ancl entered promptly after his
novitiate the College of St Michaels In
his native town. He then went to Turin,
Italy, and continued his studies. Â¦
As the time approached for his ordina
tion he was sent to the best theological
schools In France, studying In Toulouse
and Valse. and then went to the Univer
sity of Pari3, where he continued his theo
logical studies for two years longer. He
taught school at Brugieres and lxmvian.
from which latter place in Belgium came
a number of the most noted members of
the Catholic clergy of this State.
After his ordination Father Varsi was
sent by his superior to Boston, where he
taught physics and chemistry for two
years. He was later transferred to George
town College, Washington, D. C. Then
the demands of the California mission
necessitated his coming to this coast and
he was transferred to Santa Clara Col
lege and later to St. Ignatius College -of
this city. While at Santa Clara College
Father VarBi designed and built the col-'
lege theater, which Is said by experts to
be one of the finest in its acoustics and
seating properties attached to any college "
His labors at Santa Clara College for
nine years brought him to San Francisco.
St. Ignatius College was then on Market
street, between Fourth and Fifth,
and when an- advantageous offer to sell
was made Father VarBi successfully con
ducted the negotiations, and under his di
rection the present home of the Society of
Jpsus was erected. \ He was made provin
cial superior of the society in 1S77, and
held that exalted Â¦ position for more than
five years. He also filled many other po
sitions in the. order, besides engaging in
much of the charitable work.
In later yearB he prepared quietly for
the inevitable. On Monday morning
Father Varst celebrated an early mass
retired to his- room-and-dled there yester
day afternoon, surrounded by his fellow
workers in the society. He. closed his ca
reer after, fifty-five years of earnest and
conscientious labofs, loved by all who
knew -^ him and endeared to his brother
priests by a life of self-sacrificing devo
tion.
The remains of the deceased father will
be placed Inthe chapel of the Gentlemen's
Sodality this afternoon at 2 o'clock, and
will -be. brought to the church to-morrow
evening, where the office of the dead will
be recited at 8:30 o'clock. The funeral will
take place on Friday at' 9 o'clock. Inter
ment will be at Santa Clara.
The Rev. Father Varsi of the Society of Jesus and One of
the Pillars of St. Ignatius Dies at Advanced Age.
LONG CAREER IN THE SERVICE
OF CHRIST REACHES ITS CLOSE
The members of Local Union No. 151.
International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers, who constitute a large majority
of the linemen employed by the telephone
company and the various electric light
companies of San Francisco, have decided
to go out on a strike on December 1 If
their demands for a shorter workday and
Increased pay are not granted.
They ask for a day of eight hours and
uniform wages of *3 per day. At present
they work ten hours and are paid wages
varying from Jl 50 to $3 23.
The Pacific States Telephone Company
employs a larger number of linemen In
San Francisco than any other corpora
tion. The others affected are the San
Francisco Gas and Electric Company,
Mutual Electric Light Company and In
dependent Electric Light and Power Com
pany. None of them have made any di
rect response to the demands of the union,
and unless the linemen withdraw from
their position a strike, in which 250 men
will leave their employment must result.
The union makes minor demands con
cerning pay for overtime. They ask for
"time and a half" for work up till mid
night, and "double time" for work after
midnight and on Sundays and holidays.
President Sabln of the telephone com
pany issued a statement yesterday to thÂ©
employes of that corporation In which it
was asserted, among other things, that
the "terms of employment shall be dic
tated by the undersigned and no one else."
David Keefe, president of Union No. 151,
said last night that the linemen would
avoid a strike if possible.
"It is a matter of life and death with
us," Mr. Keefe said, "and we shall not
go out if treated with any consideration.
We believe our demands are Just. Our
craft Is the poorest paid of any when the
severity of the work and Its dangerous
character is considered. Only about one
Insurance company in twelve will take a
risk on one of us, and nearly all the bene
ficiary orders are closed to us. In view of
such facts, $3 per day does not seem un
reasonable."
Telephone Company Will Not
Grant Demands the Men
Have Made.
LINEMEN MAY GO
OUT ON STRIKE
MT 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon
Miss Lucle May Jackson and
Dr. Max Rothschild were mar
ried. Only the immediate
friends of the contracting
parties were present when Dr.
Hemphlll pronounced the
solemn, binding words. There were no
bridal attendants and all the details con
nected with the marriage were extremely
simple, owing to the recent death of
John P. Jackson, the bride's father.
and more of it!
o wP/ Even puch is "Die Wal-
I*B^^ kuf-rt â¢Â¦," firn number of the,
fgg_ f "Ring" trilogy and second of J
C^p/.S&r the cycle, given last night af j
the Grand Opera-house.
In "Das Rheingold" Wagner
has prone afar for his inspirationâ to the
he&vens above, the earth beneath, the j
waters under the earth; but in "Die Wai- !
ku<?re" the note of an exalted humanity j
Is struck, the flush of its color felt j
through theme and story, and we are once ]
again with our own beloved kind.
Th<> house was eold out for the hearing.
A notable audience it was. reverent. In
tensely sympathetic and silently appre
ciative except at the curtain's fall, and
once In an irrepressible burst of enthu
siasm at the wild, Berseker rush of the
"Ride of the Valkyrs." It was an audience
to be proud of. Along with his other
feathered outfit â swans and things â Mr.
Grau will carry away forever with him
the mythical jay which has so long
adorned the city's coat of arms. After
last night, and. Indeed, for many last
Rights, we need fear no comparisons with
any American cities outside of Xew York,
rot even excepting Boston and the boast
ful Chicago, and that we may be put upon
Mr. Grau's regular circuit Is daily a
nearer and surer possibility. Small won
cer if we sit down and pat ourselves on
the back a little!
Of all the varying beauties of last
right's performance, from the^crowding
Impressions of sensuous and celestial
loveliness, it is almost impossible to say
which or what stands out most promi-
By Blanche Partington
nently. The glorious, swift, mad rush of
the "Valkyrs 1 ride" carried everything be
fore it. with its magnificent swing and
compelling, gripping rhythms. The wild
cry of the heavenly sisters, the satisfying
climax of their song, the tense, high level
of power held throughout, maintained to
the full the world-wide reputation of this
famous number, fairly familiar to us from
many orchestral hearings.
Then the Siegmund and Sieglinde love
theme, wholly beautiful in Its tender and
sensuous suggestion, and interwoven
with a rich arabesque of other motives
splashed here and there In scarlet, and
gold, or ominous gray, was heard with
utmost delight. The delicious "Slumber"
theme and bright hiss and roar of "The
Magic Fire" motive went with exquisitj
prace and brilliant touch, and the whole
chain of themes, woven into colossal har
monies, made fuller, purer, nobler music
than we have yet heard, even from Wag
ner himself.
The curtain rises on Hundlng*s hut, dis
covering Siegmund and Sleglinde, both
children of Wotan and first of tho new
race of heroes (Volsungs) which Is des
tined to redeem the world from the power
of gold. To them comes Hunding and
discovers his wife Siegllnde's affinity
to the hero and Siegmund's identity with
the enemy of his race. But Siegmund, a
wandering guest, has right to the night's
hospitality and it Is here, after Sleglinde's
caring for the disarmed warrior, that* trie
beautiful love-theme Is sung.
Gadski is a noble, womanly, tender Sieg-
Ilnde, developing an unsuspected tragic
power in the troublous scenes which fol
low, and showing a full capability of hold-
Ing to a high le\'el of emotion. Van Dyck
sings the Siegmund. and with all the
genius of Interpretation, fine vocal fitness
and keen sympathy with his role that has
distinguished his work throughout the
whole season.
Thf second scene Introduces Wotan and
Fricka, this time done by Mr. BIspham
and Mme. Schumann-Helnk, and a roy
p.lly convincing god and goddess they
were. Wotan, as Mr. Bispham sees him,
is a very Incarnation of, majesty, god
like, as the best of us can conceive of
the gods: and the part Is sung with a
rich dignity and fervent power than
which nothing better vocally need be
apked for. Mme. Schumann-Heink's
Fricka is of like character. Every mo
ment of her appearance is Instinct with
meaning. No need of English transla
tion for her part In the play; each ges
ture, look, expression, one may run and
read. . .
She has a voice of extraordinary ilch
ness and power, one note from end to
end. evenness itself, and uses it with de
lightful ease. It occurs to one, by the
way, .as the irate and Jealous Fricka
gives Wotan several pieces of her royal
mind, that the gods have troubles of their
own. and that, cm the whole, they are
an amusingly incompetent, helpless
crowd.
Â¦ In the second act also appears Brunn
hilde. last night and throughout the
"Ring" Mme. Xordlca. The part nts the
artist like her coat of mail.
An heroic figure she is, brilliant, stately,
yet withal womanly, as' she pities the un
fortunate Volsungs. This is the real
Xordlca. and the part is an inspiration.
Mr. Blass gave us a good Hundlng, and
the Valkyr parts were sung by Schumnnn-
Heink, Van Cauteren, Baumeister, Homer.
Scheff. Marylli, Olitzka and Bridewell.
Damrosch was in best form last night,
the orchestra did Its most, pave In a lit
tle slack rhythm- In the violins In "The
Valkyr Ride," and the scenic machinery
was something to wonder at.
To-night the third number of the cycle,
"Siegfried," will be given, and it begins,
for the information of many, at 7:45 by
Grau time, which has acquired an un
accustomed significance to our laissez
faire San Francisco ways.
FORCED TO SIGN ORDER
AT MUZZLE OF REVOLVER
Sonna Miller, a Carpenter, Makes a
Serious Charge Against a
Saloon-Keeper.
Sonna Miller, a carpenter, residing at
2708^4 Harrison street, secured a warrant
from Judge Fritz yesterday for the arrest
of M. Tiernan, a saloon-keeper at Day and
Sanchez streets, on the charge of exhibit
ing a deadly weapon In a rude and
threatening manner.
Miller said he had been working on a
building near Tiernan' Â» saloon and had
run up a bar bill of $1, which he intended
to pa/ as soon as the Job was finished.
Saturday Tiernan came to the building
where .Miller was working and said he
would shoot him if he did not pay tho $4
Miller thought Tiernan was joking anJ
paid no more attention to the matter, .but
yesterday Tiernan again made his appear
ance with a revolver in his hand, and
pointing It at his head, produced an or
der on the boss for J4 and threatened to
shoot him if he did not sign it. As he
was afraid of his life he signed it.
The ceremony took place in the parlor of
the Jackson home on Sutter street, which
was bright with a tasteful though un
ostentatious arrangement of American
Beauty roses.
The bride wore a simple gown of white
Swiss and in her hair was a sprav of
natural orange blossoms, sent from Napa
Soda Springs.
After the ceremony Dr. and Mrs.
Rothschild left for/ Monterey, where ths
honeymoon will be- spent. On their re
turn they will make their home at the
Richelieu.

ERN'EST VAX DTCK IX THE ROLE OF SIEGMUXD. WHICH HE
SANG WITH MARKED SUCCESS LAST EVENING IN THE PRO
DUCTION OF "DIE WALKUERE."
"When the issue is directly, made between
the bosses and- the peopleâ between the
citizens and the railway, corporationsâ the
result is victory for the people. -Recent
ly in the Forty-first Assembly; District Hj
C. Dibble, who was known - as Herrin's
chief stand-by in the Legislature, ran alx-
Give the people an opportunity to elect
their representatives to nominating con
ventions and they will embrace the oppor
tunity to nominate and elect a -" State
Board of Equalization that will assess
railroad property as; the constitution di
rects, and not as Herrin decrees.
It is a 'known fact that the present
Railroad Commission is nothing- but an
adjunct of the law department of the
Southern Pacific. ,
Give the people the protection of _ law
In contests for the election of delegates
to a nominating convention and they will
take care of themselves. Appointed con
ventions and delegations chosen by the
free and easy methods of the old fash
ioned wide-open primary generally regis
ter the will of the boss. Give the people a
primary law and they will see to the nom
ination and election of Railroad Commis
sioners who will . reduce freight rates on
merchandise from San Francisco to the
Interior and on products from the interior
to San Francisco.
Surely the Legislature should take no
chances in accepting a primary law
framed in the councils of the railway cor
poration. The bill should be framed by
members of the Legislature. It should
represent the Judgment of able, honest
and intelligent men chosen by the people
to make laws. The committee or Joint
committee having charge of the measure
should Invite the views of men learned in
the law. The committee should be com
posed of the ablest representatives of both
political parties, as the legislation pro
posed is purely non-partisan and for the
benefit of all the people, irrespective of
party affiliation.
, A lawyer in the office of Code Commis
sioner W. C. Van Fleet prepared the suit
to overthrow the Stratton act. Informa
tion comes to The Call that a well-known
lawyer-politician is framing a new pri
mary law and paying frequent visits to
\V. F. Herrin to obtain suggestions on the
subject from the law department of the
Southern Pacific. Scheming lawyers in the
service of the corporation may endeavor
to insert some provision or requirement
In the new law which will invite another
adverse decision from the court. Many
good citizens deplored the decision which
set aside the Stratton act. not simply be
cause the protection to voters which the
law accorded was taken away, but chiefly
because confidence In the Judgment of a
high tribunal Beemed In danger of being
impaired.
The so-called Stratton primary law
which passed the Legislature two years
ago met the wants of the people, but the
Supreme Court found a way to set It aside
as unconstitutional. Extreme care should
be taken in the enactment of a primary
law for the future to prevent the Intro
duction of a Joker.
Aided by a good primary election law
the people can force Herrin and his under
lings out. of politics. The important duty
of framing a law for the election of dele
gates to nominating conventions will come
before the next Legislature. In the first
place it is essential that the representa
tives of the people â not the agents of the
railroad â shall organize the Legislature.
In the Senate and in the Assembly the
Republicans are dominant and the issue
Is squarely up to the Republican party.
California can never attain the measure
of Industrial prosperity which her re
sources and position entitle her to receive,
until the leech-like incubus of the rail
road is thrown off. The Southern Pacific
would be vastly better oft from a dividend
earning and business point of view If the
company were out of politics. Confisca
tion of railroad property is not threatened.
The ghost of the sand lot no longer stalks
at the Legislature. Farmers, merchants
and business men of the State have no
inclination to "cinch" the Southern Pa
clflc. On the contrary, they would like
to see increased traffic. Improved service
and greater facilities for handling the
legitimate business of the road. The con
ditions are favorable to the establishment
of good relations between the people and
the .corporation.
In truth Herrln's political bureau, es
tablished by the power and prestige of
the Southern Pacllic, is a menace to the
commonwealth. It would be dangerous In
the extreme if Herrin wee a strong, ag
grespive and resourceful man, but he Is
vacillating and Irresolute, wasting much
of the power ihat he might exert. Still
the fact presents itself that many agents
in the active service of the railroad's po
litical bureau are on the payroll of tho
State or Federal Government. They draw
pay from the people and work for the
road. They have the notion that the com
pany can keep them In public office, and
therefore acknowledge allegiance to the
corporation and hold the public in con
tempt.
Of course, the little bupybodies who
do nasty politics for the bureau greatly
magnify the importance of Herrin. The
clever manipulators in the political arena
designate him as a lobster in politics. It
Is generally conceded, however, that he
can do pretty much as he wills with the
Railroad Commission, the State Board of
Equalization and the office of Collector
of United States Internal Revenue and
that several State officers make haste to
do the bidding of the bureau. To gain
the favor of the Southern Pacific they ne
glect their duties to the State as readily
as John C. Lynch neglects his Federal
duties.
In the council of the railroad underlings
the talk goes that President Hays would
hardly dare to issue an order to close the
political bureau of the law department, as
Herrin would question the decree and
threaten to place the interests of the com
pany at the mercy of rapacious politi
cians. **
Moreover, the claim is put forward that
Herrin is so strongly intrenched in power
that the new president, if minded to dis
turb him. could not safely dislodge him.
It is contended by the superserviceable
agents of the bureau that Herrin will be
able to show, when the time comes to
play his hand, that he personally controls.
Independent of the corporation, .the Slate
Board of Railroad Commissioners, the
State Board of Equalization, several
minor State ofllcers, one important Fed
eral office with a long line of deputies,
several lights of the Judiciary and a
bunch of State Senators and Asembly
men.
Agents of the Southern Pacific Com
pany's political bureau in California are
spreading the rumor that Charles M.
Hays, the new president of the corpora
tion, will be compelled to retain the bu
reau and keep \V. F. Herrln as its chief
manager. It is not asserted that Mr.
Hays is anxious to mix in political af
fairs at the expense of the company'3
business, but the argument is advance:!
that Uerrin has acquired advantages that
the corporation dare .not surrender.
