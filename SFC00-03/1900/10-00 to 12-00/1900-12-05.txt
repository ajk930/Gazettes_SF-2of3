tor Steele stood on the front platform
of the first car keeping a sharp lookout,
which would indicate that he thought - he
was taking desperate chances. The
weather was very foggy and it was im
possible to see a great distance ahead:-
When passing through a shallow cut
just before coming to a short bend in the
track above Vandon station, Conductor
Steele paw the freight train coming at
.full ppeed down the track. He signaled
down br^fkfs and with several other of the
working crew jumped from the train.
The engineer of the freight also saw that
there would be a collision and after re
versing his engine and applying the. air
he and his fireman Jumped to the ground.
Scarcely had those who jumped -regained
their feet and got out of the way before
the two trains crashed together.
The work train was running at a speed
of about twenty, miles an" hour and the
j freight about ihirty-five. The force of
j the. impact was terrible. The engine of
the freight train struck the .dining-car of
the work train and smashed U into splin
ters. The three. fleeping-cars of the work
train were telescoped and piled- off to
one side of thV track. The freight en
gine finally came to a stop whe'n it
reached the caboose, which was next -to
the locomotive of the work train.
The freight train, in charge . of Con
ductor Plane, was three hours late. It is
already evident that neither he nor other
members of the freight train crew is rer
sponsible for the collision. The fault,
railroad officials say, lies with some mem
ber of the other crew. It is apparent that
the work train was trying to reach Can
non station before the Sacramento local,
i due at Suigun at 8:30, should reach that
place. The wreck occurred at 7:40 a, m.,
but news of it did not reach the San Fran
cisco offices until 9 o'clock.
The special train bearing the Injured ar
rived at Oakland at 1:20 o'clock yesterday
afternoon. Dr. Downing of Suisun and
Dr. Rickey of Port Costa were aboard
the train and rendered invaluable service
to thoee most seriously Injured. At the
Oakland mole Drs. D. W. Ogden and H.
E. Anderson of the Southern Pacific Hos
pital were in waiting with four ambu
lances and as many hacks. Conductor
Steele was in charge of the special. It
was made up of a caboose, a bunkcar and
a boxc8r. and the train made ihe run from
the scene of the accident to Oakland, mole
in one hour and fifty-five minutes.
The men injured were . quickly ! placed
In the conveyances and then the ferry
boat Berkeley brought them to this. city.
Drs. Olmstead and Meggs of Oakland
came over with the other physicians. In
this city some of the injured were placed
In a. special car and taken direct to the
hospital via Market and Mission streets!
Upon arrival at the hospital that Insti
tution's full corps of nurses and physi
cians took charge or the injured.
Thomas Glynn of Wisconsin- who ' has
been working for the company about a
month, said most of the men who were'
hurt were seated in the, two bunke'ars,
which were third and fourth from the
of. each other in. the- midst of splintered
boards. Davis has two children'in the old
country. HIb wife is dead. -He received
a bad scalp wound and severe injuries to
Ms rlRht leg. '
B. -M. Mahoney, one of the section men
injured in the wreck, d Jed while on the
relief train to San Frfcncisco. His body
was removed to the Oakland Morgue.
His identification was had from a memo
randum he had made in a notebook short
ly before his death. ' It read, "My name is
B. M. Mahoney, Klethville, 111.; Dec. 4,
in/ wreck." The name of Robert Thomp
son, Kiethvllle, 111., also appeared in
the memorandum. - The deceased laborer
was about 50 years old. He' had gone to
work for his first day on the railroad
when he was caught in, the .wreck. Â¦, Ma
honey was badly crushed about the .legs;
the shock; and hemorrhage caused, death.
Railroad men who visited the Morgue
could give no further information about
the man. . . Â¦
Some miraculous escapes are reported.
B. Roland, the foreman of the work train,
was In the dining car when . he sa w the
impending danger. He rushed out of the
car and jumped to the ground. The stew
ard and the two Chinese cooks were fol
lowing him, but they. were caught before
they; could escstpe from the car and re
ceived injuries ' which may , prove fatal.
Three of, the men Â¦ were lying In a .bunk
In one of .the sleeping-cars., The one In
the center' escaped with a few slight
bruises,' but his comrades received injur
ies from .which they . will . probably die. . I
Ed McGovern, one of the killed; Was In
the recent wreck on the "Â¦ Owl train near
Antfoch. He escaped from that uninjured,
only . to* meet a horrible death In . the
wreck yesterday morning.
McGovern and Ahern were from Stock
ton. Kerohan was from Michigan. Noth
ing is known of* Hughes arid Blummer*
the other- two of the five men. who were
killed outright.
Several men â¢ among the wounded will
not recover. J. Kelleher â¢ received a frac-.
ture of the . skull and his left thigh" is
crushed. The surgeons say there is no
chance for him. John Daly fa among the
most severely injured, being bruised from
head to foot. He has ( a^leg and, several
ribs broken and . apparently- his spine Is
injured.

Mrs. de la Montanya Is all alone in fcrr
trouble. Other members of her fam!!y
are in Europe and she has do one near
or dear to her to go to for comfort or
advice. - v f Â¦'-
"I am so alone and need sympathy so
much," she said. "Treat me kindly."
The story contained in the divorce com
plaint which was filed late yesterday af
ternoon is more prosaic and likewise more
detailed than that told by Mrs. de !i
Montanya. "On May 7. 1808." she says, "I
married my huaband (this being the daiÂ»
of their second marriage) at Napa in till*
State. Since that time he has been gulliy
of habitual intemperance to such a degrs-e
that . longer life With him as his^wtfe la
impossible. ' In March of 1SD9. when in a
passion, he struck me in the, face, which.
In addition to the physical suffering tbj
blow caused, greatly humiliated and
shocked me.
"To make my humiliation tho more
keen he constantly told me that he waa
In love with a woman-ihe most beautiful
woman in all San Francisco, for whose
affections all the wealthy men. In town
were vying. but without chance of suc
cess, for he had won her. In September
of 1890 he told me that he wan geing t<>
China. He left the city and I did noi
hear from him again for some weeks, tho.i
he was In London, England. He wrote me
asking if everything was all right and if
arrangements had been completed. E;.'
this he referred to the possible institution
of divorce proceedings by me, to which ha
did not seem opposed.
"He promised to allow me $300 a month
during his absence. He said he would set'd
me $300 on the first of every month and
$200 on the 13th thereof. He did not kee;>
his word, however, and I received no
financial assistance from him. I belleva
that ha has been guilty of frequent vio
lation of bis marriage vows and his own
statements add evidence to the probable
fact."
. In conclusion Mrs. de la Montanya
states that her husband is worth U00.00O
and hence. If he had the inclination, he
was able to keep his agreement to supply
her with funds. In addition to a decrco
of absolute divorce on the grounds named
Mrs. de la Montanya demands the cus
tody of her minor children â Lorraine S.
and Jacques de la Montanya. She a!.'o
prays for Judgment against him for ali
mony In the sum of J730 a month, which
sum. she says, Is none too large for tho
maintenance , of her homo in accordance
with her station In life, Mrs. de la Mon
tanya Is . represented by the law firm of
Rodgers, Pater son & Slack.
Â¦In 1Â§33, immediately after Mr. de la
Montanya's return from a trip to Europe,
the couple separated, the husband taking
the two children and returning to Paris,
where- he became domiciled as a French
citizen under the French law. Mrs. de la
Montanya brought suit for divorce and
for the custody of the children. The
claim was set up with regard to the chil
dren that the husband had left the State
to escape the Jurisdiction of -the Califor
nia, courts." She also brought a suit sep
arate from the divorce proceedings to re
cover the custody of the children. The
case was heard and judgment was ren
dered by default. Dorn & Dorn then ap

MRS. LORRAINE WRIGHT DE
LA MOXTANYA once again
wants to be legally rid of the
Donds that bind her to James de
la Montanya, the father of her
two children and the man whom she
promised upen two different occasions to
love and honor and obey.
' The complaint in the action for a di
vorce was filed yesterday afternoon in the
office of the County Clerk, and therein
the young wife alleges intemperance, cru
elty and infidelity as the grcunds upon
which she bases her right to once again
be free.'
Several years ago, after the De la Mon
taryas had been permitted by the court
to go their several ways, they furnished
their friends with any amount of sensa
tional gossip. This time the sensation
v/ill not be missing, but it will be. of a
totally different order and will come be
fore the twice-forced matrimonial bonds
are broken. A blonde lady will play the
star role in the case. She figures pro
saicly in the complaint as "Jane Doe,"
but according to De la Montanya, as
quoted by his wife, "She Is the most beau
tiful woman in' San Francisco."
Way out en Point Lobos avenue Mrs. de
la Montanya lives with her two children.
Her little daughter Lorraine. 12 years old,
the first bom of the unhappy marriage, is_
very ill and her mother is nursing her.
"This is dreadful," said Mrs. de la
Montanya last night, "this awful notor
iety. And I have been' through It once
before. When I remarried Jtm In 1S98
I did so because I though it was the best
thing I could do for my children's sake.
Now that; I ask for a divorce once more.
It is again the love I bear for my chil
dren that prompts me to act as I do. I
bear no hard feelings toward Jim. ' I
think ha Is more to be pitied than
blamed."
Upon no conditions will Mrs. de la Mon
tanya reveal the name of -the woman
who, her *husbahd told her, was the
most beautiful woman in San Francisco.
"It would not be fair," said the suffer
ing . mother. "Jim never told me her
name, but, of course, I know It. I shall
never reveal it, however, unless I am
forced to do It In court. Jim. was the first
to speak to me of her.
" 'I am In love,' he said one day to me,
'with the most beautiful woman in San
Francisco. All the men of wealth of this
city are groveling in despair at her feet.
But It is no use. I have won her.' Tell
me her name,' I cried. . 'No.* said- my
husband, 'her name is" too sacred to men
tion in. this house.' "
If Mrs. de la Montanya will not tell the
name of the woman that has the million
aires groveling she is not, averse 'to giving
a description of her. She is a tall perox
ide blonde and previous to meeting De
la Montanya she enjoyed the friendship
of â¢ a prominent clubman. She Is about
tweBty-five or twenty-six . and may be a
Frenchwoman;- at any rate she has a
French name. Further, this Is . not her
first scandal.
Of. all the tales of cruelty. the wife tells
none are more pitiful than the father's
habitual 'abuse of their little daughter.
' "His" abuse of, Lorraine was constant."
said Mrs. de la Montanya. "He applied
opprobrious names to her and in every
way made her suffer. This treatment of
our! daughter began immediately after
our "remarriage. It was the most' cruel
thing I was forced to endure and I suf-

almost the moment of the crash.
The work train was backing up, try!nÂ«

th*Â» engine cf No. CJ1 loom"d up before the
laborers a;:d crew of the work train. No. \

Jury. Five were killed outright, one died j
bef ore he could be got to San Francisco
and the seventh passed away In the rail
road hospital In this city. Several of the
wounded will undoubtedly die of their in
juries.
The. list of the dead is as follows: J.
Blummer, H. Kerohan, Edward McGov
ern, John Hughes, J. Ahern, B. M. Ma
boney and B. Maloney.
The five men first named were killed
outright and their bodies are now at the
Morgue at Suisun. B. M. Mahoney died
or. the way to San Francisco and B. Ma
loney at the hospital.
The engineer and fireman of the freight
train escaped Injury. They saved their
lives by jumping before the engine left
the track and toppled over on its tide.
The crew of the work train ,also escaped
uninjured, though little but wreckage was
left of the train.
The scene after the wreck was a: har
rowing one. The forty laborers of the
work train were thrown into the midst of
the wreckage of the cars and even those
who were unhurt extricated themselves
Â¦with difficulty from the s-plintered wood
and twisted iron. The injured, pome help
less from their injuries and others pinned
down In the wreckage, fhouted for help
end ehrieked in pain. Some of the dead
were terribly mangled and the windrow
cf wreckage was alive with the writhing
forms of the injured.
The fourteen uninjured laborers and tlie
two crews hastened to the aid of the
wounded. Their labor was fraught with
the greatest difficulties and much time
was consumed In getting the Injured clear
of the demolished cars.
An overturned stove set fir* to the
debris and promised to consume the un
fortunates who were entangled in the
wreck. Those who were on the outside
could not get to the fire, but they
brought buckets of water and passed
them in to some of those least Injured and
the flames were put out.
The engine and caboose of the work
train were dispatched to Suisun for as-
Mstance- A special trsdn was made up
there and with the physicians of the ttjwn
and a large number of volunteers it re
turned to the scene of the disaster. Help
was also secured from Vacaviile. Tho
wounded to the cumber of nineteen were
placed aboard the special train and with
the Â»urg<-ons and their assistants were
brought to the railroad hospital In San
Francisco. The dead were taken to Sui
*un lÂ»ter In the dav and Coroner J. J.
McDonald was arranging last evening for
the inquest, which will be held to-day.
Wrecking trains' .arrived from Sacramento
hid Oakland and the track was cleared
for traffic about 4:30 o'clock In the after
noon.
The work train had been stationed at
Sui*un for some time, engaged In making
repairs and Improvements along the line
between that place and Davisville. It left
Bulsun yesterday morning In charge of j
'"onductor Steele and was running under i
?*<jrking orders, It being the conductors
/mention to make the siding at Cannon
station and let freight train No. 201. which
van three hours -late. pass. Ti*e work
iraln was running backward and Conduc-
the company was doing the flagging. He
was., instructed to pay especial attention
to that work train at 7 o'clock this morn
ing and to look after it until 7 o'clock
this evening. What he did I have no
means yet of knowing. The morning was
quite foggy and .it may be that the en
gineer of the freight train ran pasÂ£ thos*
signals, but of that I cannot' 4 speak until
after .an investigation, which will be held
to-morrow and which I have now or
dered. . s
"The ff eight train must have* been mak
ing about twenty or twenty-five miles an
hour. . It was drawn by encine'No. 1i53Q
and the engine was in control of Engineer
Vuzzo. The train w"as in charge of Con
ductor. Plane. The work train was behind
engine Xo. 1722. The engine was driven by
Engineer Tracey and the train was In
charge of Conductor Steele. The freight
train-had several cars badly -broken and
the e.ngine Is lying on Its side. The work
train had several platform cars destroyed.
The engine was not damaged. /"-.
"J do not know yet who was the man
who was sent out to do the flagging. That
Information will come later.
"The loss to the property of the com
pany will not be ' great. The wreck, as
nearly as I can understand, took place
about 7:40 o'clock this morning. I have
not yet learned.of any orders which may
have been/ Issued in The case. It would
seem as if the work train was at fault,
but I cannot, as I have said, speak posi
tively on that subject. I am sorry, very
sorry, that this accident nas taken place. '
BLAMES CONDUCTOR STEELE.
General^Manager Kruttschnitt Says
His Course Was Inexcusable.
The first news Â»f the wreck 'reached' the
local offices of the Southern, Pacific at 9
o'clock yesterday morning. The tele
gram, which was dated Klmlra,. stated
that a work train, with a large force em
ployed in picking up ties, had backed into
regular freight train No. 201 between Van
den and Cannon, killing: five men and in
juring nineteen.
, The work train, according to the mes-
I uage, had orders to go on at 7 a. m. and
'.to. protect Itself agalnst*B.ll trains. At El
! mira Conductor Steele asked the location
of the "regular freight. No. 201. which was
overdue. lie got his information, but
evidently overlooked It, as he was- back-
Ing up against" No. 201 in a fog when the
crash came. The telegram further stated
that, from all appearances the blame
rested wjth Conductor Steele.
Orders were at once issued by General
Manager Kruttschnitt to have the injured
brought to this city on a special train,
whiph was made up at Elmira. A wreck
crew was also hurriedly sent out. ' There
was more debris to be cleared than was
at first supposed and no more trains were
able to get over the line during the day.
The regular train service was tem-
I porarily interfered with, it being neces
sary to send all trains around by way of
Stockton.
In the absence, of Manager Fillmore,
who Is in the East, all the information
which the company received about the
wreck went to General Manager Krutt
schnitt and Mr. Richardson, who gave out
such orders as they thought best. Mr.
Kruttschnitt made the following state
ment concerning: the cause of the acci
dent: .
"The Information which we have at
hand indicates very clearly that the acci
dent was the result of pure carelessness
or negligence on the part of those in
charge of the work train. Conductor
Steeie knew < well his business.. That is
apparent from the, fact that he made in
quiries concerning the regular freight at
the station In .Â¦Elmira. He got the in
formation he sought, but evidently' failed
to act properly upon it. j
"Instead of holding his train at a proper
point until the regular freight had passed
he gave orders to back. His action seems
all the, more Inexcusable since there was
a heavy fog at the time and it was impos
sible to see but a few feet ahead. Conse
quently the regular freight had absolutely
no warning until it was upon the work
train. "I cannot account for Steele' s ac
tions. He must have known the fearful
chances he was taking, j There was noth
ing defective about eltlier of the. two
trains or the track that could have caused
the accident." . r -
Mr. -Kruttschnitt added that It was the
worst wreck the company had experienced
in this vicinity in a long time. Work oni
clearing away the debris will be pushed
with all possible speed, Â¦ and . It is hoped
to' have the line in shape for regular traffic
again to-day. : Â¦â¢' _ ,

America will rapidly increase, - as will aleo

WASHINGTON*. Dec. 4.â The re
port of the Isthmian Canal
Coramif-slon, submitted by the
President to Congress to-day,
Fives zÂ» the unanimous con
clusion of that body that "the most prac
ticable and feasible route for an isthmian
canal under the control, management and
ownership of the United States Is that
known as the Nicaraguan route."
The commission estimates the cost of
this route at $200,540,000. This estimate is
much in excess of any heretofore made,
and is due to increased dimensions and
other features not heretofore considered.
The commission estimates the cost of a
canal by the Panama route at $142,342,579
according to one route, or $156,375,258 ac
cording to another route. As between the
Nicaragua ard Panama routes the com
misFion sums up a number of advantages
favorable to the former. J It states aiso
that under the concessions given by the
Government of Colombia to the Panama
Canal Company that Government is not
freo to grant the necessary rights to the
United States except upon conditions
mc.de by the company.
The report is a document of about 17,000
words, almost as long as the President's
message. Although the work of the com
mission is not yet completed, many of the
field parties still being out, yet it has
been sufficiently advised to make it prac
ucaDle to present this preliminary report,
giving the^essential nnaings.
A tnorough investigation has been made
not only of the Nicaragua and Panama
routes but of other possible routes, the
commission keeping in mind the indus
trial, commercial and military value of an
tnteroceanic canal, and also the privileges
and franchises necessary to be secured
tor the construction of a canal under the
control, management and ownership of
the United States. In all eleven wonting
parties were organized and sent into the
Held, making a force of about 220 engi
neers and assistants, besides apout bOO
laborers, boatmen and other workmen em
ployed in the various countries, a total of
more than 800. Meanwhile the members
of the commission personally conducted
various branches of the work. One party
went to Paris, where they examined the
details of the Panama canal project, now
fceing executed by the French company.
Over the Several Routes.
A detailed description is given of the
trip over the several routes. Along the
Xicaraguan route it was found that the
short section of , partially constructed
canal Is perhaps In as good chape to-day
as it was when the work was stopped.
'Ihe buildings, however, are all rotten* and
the dredges, boats, etc., are worthless.
The commission visited President Zelaya
and other officials of Nicaragua and found
them greatly interested in the project.
The occupation of their territory by the
United States for canal purposes did not
seem to be regarded as a serious obstacle,
provided the sovereignty of the republic
was respected.- Along the Panama route
the commission found a large force of
workmen . engaged upon the canal line,
about 2000 in number, according to the
Panama Company. The canal had been
opened to some extent at both ends. Im
mense quantities of machinery, imple
ments and tools were- found along the
route. Much of this property, the com
mission reports, is ill adapted to American
methods of work, and all of it is now from
thirteen to twenty years old, so that no
value should be given to the plant now on
the isthmus.
A visit was also made to President Igle
eias of Costa Rica and his Cabinet and
a strong sentiment was found to exist for
an American canal along the Nicaragua
route. Reports are made along the Darien
route. ;
After going over the several routes the
commission considered the dimensions of
the canal to be built. Having in mind
the increasing size of ocean-going vessels
it was determined to fix upon a depth of
thirty-five feet at mean low 'water and
a bottom width of 1EÂ»O f/et, with some in
crease of dimensions at certain points.
These dimensions are larger than tho?e
proposed for any ,prevlous canal scheme.
While they seem excessive to-day the
commission says that the canal Is not
likely to be opened within ten years, dur
ing which time the increase in maritime
dimensions is likely to continue. A width
of liX) feet will allow all but the very
largest ships to pass In the canal, while
it is to be a long and strenuous conflict.
Each nation Is seeking the advantage of
its rivals In this conflict and is pressing
forward to gain that advantage. Most of
the foreign nations are looking for com
mercial advantages in the East. Russia,
France, Greai Britain. Italy and' Ger
many are paying an aggregate of $5,000,000
per year in subsidies -for the carrying
ships of. the Eastern trade."
He pointed out that under, present
conditions it costs the United States from
40 to 80 per cent more, principally in wages
and food, to operate its ships than it costs
Great Britain, and about 80 per cent more
than it costs Norway, and that the United
States- is forced to compete under such
a handicap with the encouraged and pro
tected ships of foreign countries.
Frye discussed at some length the ques
tion of export bounties and discriminating
duties, maintaining that export bounties
were impracticable and that in the mat
ter of discriminating duties the United
States would encounter no less than
thirty-one different treaties. These would
have to be abrogated If discriminating
duties were enforced. The abrogation of
.these treaties would be an offenee to
every nation involved. I
"Our relations with European countries
to-day," he resumed, "are most amiable.
Do vou r think it .wise, to 'disturb these re
lations at the present time?"
Â¦ Senator Frye said he could see no rea
son why any man should favor free ships
as a remedy. In this connection he re
ferred to the . shipyards of the United
States and expressed the ; opinion that a

SAX DIEGO. Dec. 4.â Secretary H. V.

this noon for Washington to represent

action on the Nicaraguan . canal Rill. Ha
has been at the capital before on th*
Fame sort of a proposition . and always
did efficient service. Last evening he re
ceived a latter from Senator John T. Mor
gan of Alabama, who is the father of the
canal measures in the Senate. The letter
is dated November 27 and the Senator had
just been Informed that the Walker com
mission would unanimously favor the
Nicaragruan route, a fact which was made
public In Washington to-day. Comment
ing on what the commission would report
the Senator says:
"A canal 100 feet wide and thirty feet
deep i3 all we need, with single Instead
of double locks. Thia can be built for a
sum far less than the estimates, but hÂ»
asking for legislation we must assume
the outside cost as our predicate, and so
it is necessary that we should present ad
vantages especially to commerce that will
at least balance the account. In this view
it is very important to show tvhat tha
Pacific Coast, including Alaska, will save
to her productions and commerce by tha
use of. the canal and the tonnage that
will, pass through it to and from that
extent of coast line. l
"You and other commercial men on
that coast should be able to give data on
these points that would be very important
and in this connection your coming here
prepared with these facts, will be a great
help to the friends of the canal. What
I have mentioned will be the probabla
ground of the greatest controversy.
"As to the necesalty of tho canal for
commercial and other reasons the argu
ment is practically closed and the demand
for its construction is almost universal
and imperative.- What we have now to
show is that the cost of the canal, if it
should be even $200,000,000, Is not In ex
cess of its benefits to our country. It la
easy enough to answer this rationally on
a general view of the subject, but we
must be prepared - to demonstrate tha
problem. - It is your help in this direction
that is needed."

the locks are of a dimension to permit
even the largest ships afloat to be ma
neuvered. The size of the locks Is 740
feet In lengrth, S4 feet in width in the
clear, with a depth of 35 feet.
Cost of the Nicaragua Canal.
Taking up the Nicaragua^ route In de
tail the commission says the route
adopted follows essentially the lines laid
down by the Nicaragua Canal Commis
sion in its report of 1S97-93. It begins near
Greytown, on the Atlantic side, follows
the San Juan River, enters Lake Nicara
gua and terminates at Brito, on the Pa
cific side. The distance from ocean to
ocean is about 186 miles. Plans are given
for the great harbors required at Grey
town and Brlto. The most difficult en
gineering work is tho dam across the San
Juan River to regulate the waters of the
lake. The . time required to build the
canal hinges almost entirely on the time
required for the construction of this dam.
The commission says eight years would
probably be a reasonable estimate for the
building. At least two years will be con
sumed in preparatory work and opening a
harbor at Greytown, so that if work on
the dam should be commenced immedi
ately thereafter the time required for
completing the entire work will be about
ten years.
The commission then submits the fol
lowing estimated cost of a canal on the
Nicaragua route:
Eastern division (from Greytown to
Boca San Carlos dam), JS2.G62.000; middle
division (from Boca San Carlos dam to
Las Lajas), $25,425,000; western division
(from Las Lajas to Brito), $TÂ»1,6SO,000;
ninety-eight miles of railroad, $7,350,000;
total, $167,117,000; engineering, police, san
itation and general contingency, $33,423,
000; aggregate, $200,540,000.
This estimate Is for a canal suitable for
navigation by the largest ships now in
existence and thus in accordance with the
terms of the bill pending in Congress. It
provides for a double system of locks, so
that navigation can be maintained if one
system be closed for repairs or renewals.
If a single lockage system is provided the
cost will be reduced $19,678,000. Narrowing
the bottom one-third will permit a further
reduction of $16,949,000. This would bring
the estimated cost down to $163,913,000. -
Figures on Panama Ditch.
Concerning the Panama route, the com
mission says its natural attraction lies in
the combination of a very narrow Isthmus
with a low summit. The width of the
Isthmus is lens than â¢ thirtv-flve - miles,
while the summit is barely 300 feet above
mean tide.' After a detailed description
or.- the entire route, the commission gives
the following estimated cost "of complet
ing the Panama* canal route: Colon en
trance and harbor, $7,334,673; harbor to
Bohio locks. Including levees, $10,718,288;
Bohio locks,. Including excavation, $10,982,
345; Lake Bohio, $2,786,449: Oblspo gates
$295,436; Culebra section, $44,357,335; Pedro

611; Miraflores locks, Including excavation
and spill way, $5,720,863: Pacific level, $12,
366,814; Bohio dam, $8,500,000; Gigante spill

marshes, $1,448,076; Chagres river diver-
well be without a constitution as to be
without shipyards, v- He , showed how
much greater was the cost of building and
operating ships. under the American flag.
If these expenses were not so great there
would be no excuse for the pending bill
and Its foundation would fall. He pointed
f Â£ er efore, to an array of . figures to prove
that it costs not only more to. construct
American ships but more to operate them
after they were built' than foreign ships.
Ills figures indicated that ships of Great
Britain had an advantage of $4 50 to $5
per, gross ton over American ships in the
expense of construction and operation.
Senator Frye related . the incident cited
by Mr. Clyde of ' the Clyde Steamship
Company before the Commerce Commit
tee on the operation! of a ship under the
Norwegian flag and an exactly -similar
vessel under the American flap. The ex
pense of operating: * the Norwegian ship, Â¦
he. said, was Just half that of operating
the American ship between the same '
ports. Â¦-Â¦ Â¦Â¦Â¦
The speaker referred aluo to the line of'
vessels run by the late John Roach from
New York to Brazil. They came into com
petition with' a' line of Spanish -ships
exactly similar in size and speed, to- the <
American ships. .^The - Spanish ' vessels
had a yearly advantage of $12,000 over the
American ships and -could make money
carrying freight at $5 per ton. while â¢ tha
American. vessels in order, to make money
had "to charge $7 BO per ton. Mr. Roach
was forced to tell the line of t vessels and
Mr. Thurber and the other purchasers' of
the ships eventually lost their, entire in- i
vestment. * .- . , ;
mission believes Â¦ such agreement Is Impracti
cable. So far as can be ascertained, the com-
P a ny is not willing to sell Us franchise, but
it will allow the United States to become part
owner of Us stock. The commission considers
such an arrangement inadmissible.
Untrammelled by Concessions.
The Governments of Nicaragua and Costa
Rica on the other hand are- untrammeled by
concessions and are free to grant to the United
States such privileges aa may be mutually
agreed upon.
In view of all the facts and particularly in
view of all the difficulties of obtaining the
necessary rights, privileges and franchises on
the Panama route, and assuming that Nlca-'
ragua and Costa Rica recognize the value of
tho canal to themselves and are prepared to
grant concessions on terms which are reason
able and acceptable to tha United States the
commission is of the opinion that "the most
practicable and feasible route for tn Isthmian
canal to be under the management and owner
ship of the United States 1 ' Is that known as
the Nicaragua route.
. Th Â« message of the President transmit

CONSIDERATION OF CANAL BILL
Hay-Pauncefote Treaty First to Be
Disposed of by the Senate.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.- The Senate
Committee on Interoceanic Canals had a
meeting to-day at the instance of its
chairman. Senator Morgan, to consider
the status of the Nicaragua canal bill.
The bill is tte special order In the Senate
for next Monday, but Jhere is a desire on
the part of the Republican members to
have It postponed for a time, at least
pending the consideration of the subsidy
shipping bin and the Hay-Pauncefote
treaty. Senator Hanna, who is especially
interested in the shipping bill, sat with the
committee, presenting the views of the Re
publican managers on the relative claims
of the various measures to precedence In
the matter of consideration.
The committee did not reach any defi
nite conclusion as to the line of action to
be pursued. When the committee ad
journed, however, the members felt from
the expressions Of the friends of the canal
bill, and especially from Senator Morgan's
attitude as developed at the meeting that
there would be no effort on the part of the
friends of the bill to. obstruct the subsidy
bill with the canal -bill. suosiay
Senator- Morgan admitted ! that if the
subsidy bill should be made thÂ© reeuiar
order of the Senate, as contemplated that
action would have the effect cf dlSDlacine
the special order. He did not seem dis
turbed over this fact, but on tho contrary
appeared quite satisfied with the virtual
assurances of other members of the com
mittee that the canal bill should follow
the subsidy measure for consideration
He also expressed his willingness that
the Hay-Pauncefote treaty should be
canal bn? n advance of wÂ«on upon thi
ported to be more favorable for sailing;
vessels. - The Nicaragua route Is also re
garded as advantageous through Its de
velopment of the country through which
it passes. It fa pointed 6ut that the Pan
ama concession now held by the French
company prohibits a cession of rights to
any nation, or foreign government. The
concession Is limited so that If the United
States acquired it there would not be an
absolute ownership in perpetuity, as the
concession provides that the cans! shall
Pass to Colombia after ninety-nine years.
The commission asked President Hutln
of the French company to name terms
upon which the company will dispase of
its property and interests to the United
States. No formal reply was received un
til the commission's report was being
closed. The report says the conferences
have resulted in no offer to dispose of the
property to the United States upon any
terms, nor had the company expressed
any desire to negotiate with the United
States with reference to such a disposi
tion. It was proposed by President Hutin
that the United States might obtain con
trol of the canal scheme as a majority
stockholder of a new organization. The
company prefers, however, to relncorpor
atein the United States and accord to this
Government such representation on Its
board of directors and sQch purchase of
interest as its concessions permitted.
Nicaragua Route the Cheaper.
The final conclusions of the commission
are stated as follows:
1â The estimated cost of building the Nica
ragua canal is about $58,000,000 more than that
of completing the Panama canal, leaving out
the cost of acquiring the latter property. This
measures the difference In the magnitude of
the obstacles to be overcome In the actual con
struction of the two canals, and covers all
physical considerations such as the greater or
less height of dams, the greater or less depth
of cuts, the presence or absence of natural har
bors, the presence or absence of a railroad, the '
exemption from liability to disease and the
amount of work remaining- to be done. The
new Panama Canal Company has shown no
disposition to sell its property to the United
States. Should that company bÂ« able and will
ing to sell, there is reason to believe that the
price would not be such as would make the
total cost to the United States less than that
of the Nicaragua canal.
2â The Panama canal, after completion,
would be shorter, i have fewer locks and less
curvature than the Nicaragua canal. Â¦ The
measure of these advantages is tha time re
quired for . a vessel to pass through, Â¦ which Is
estimated - at thirty-three hours > for Nica
ragua.-
On the other hand the distance from San
Francisco to New York Is 877 miles, to New
Orleans 579 miles, and . to Liverpool 38Â« miles
greater via Panama than via Nicaragua. The
time required to pass over these distances be
ing greater than the dlfterenca'in the time of
transit through the canals, the Nicaragua line,'
after completion, would be somewbat more ad
\-antageous of ' the two to the United - States,
ndt withstanding the greater cost of main
tenance of the longer canal. .
3 â The Government of Colombia, In which
lies the Panama canal, has granted an ex
clusive concession which still has many years
to run. . It is not . free to grant tha necessary
rights to the United States , except upon con
dition that Â¦' an agreement Â¦ be - reached with
the New Panama Canal Company. The com-
It Is Proposed to Construct the Great Waterway^Thirty-Five Peet Deep and One Hundred and Fifty
Wide, and the Cost Is Estimated at More Than jfeOO^OP.OOO^-Big Ships to Be Provided For.

(I * , Constructor Francis T. Bowles as chief constructor of the navy, !n suc-
V^^7 cession to Rear Admiral Philip Hichborn, who will retire on March 4
next. Mr. Bowles is now on duty.in : the Brooklyn Xavy Yard. He holds
an enviable position in' the service, and his selection is regarded as particularly
fortunate. ... ,
Mr. Bowles was born in Springfield. on October 7, 185S, and was the first
member of the construction corps to graduate from the Naval Academy. His no
table achievements have been the construction of the battleship Texas and the
cruiser Raleigh, in the Norfolk yard, and the development of that yard Into a
first class naval . station. From Norfolk Mr. Bowles was transferred to New
York. ' . '
Mr. Bowles will, have tne distinction of being the youngest officer who ever
held the title of rear admiral, such being the rank of chiefs of bureaus of the
Navy Department.

.Charges were preferred against him, but
it was found that through some defect in
the law/ no court-martial Is provided fior

Frank Campbell, .one of the injured
men, is a resident of Oakland, living
at the home of his sister, Mrs. J. F. Pirie,
at 870 Castro street. Campbell was em
ployed as steward of Threlkeld's su^nly
outfit and was in> the sunply car when
the accident occurred. He was thrown
among a mass of materials. His right
arm was broken and;the wrist severely
sprained. He also received some .fearful
cuts about the face and head. v Mrs/ Pirie,
who had heard the report of the accident
and knew not but that her brother; was
among the killed, took the local train and
arrived at the pier while the Injured men
were ' being placed on stretchers and' car
ried from the cars. The sight of the man
gled bodies and the â¢ fear for her brother
proved to be too great, and she had to be
assisted to one, side by , her 'husband 'and
friends,- who were -Boon able to . tell her
"Jim Davis has alwaya been strong
enough to pull through any kind of a
deal and I guess he'll pull through ' this.
Oh, this pain Is awfulâ be careful, that
heel Is dropping off. There, thanks, old
man. Jim Davis is strong and you doc
tors will do the rest."
A stimulant quickly administered by one
of the crew Qt physicians seemed to re
lieve him considerably, but as he ground
his teeth In pain he murmured, "I'll bo
all right."
H. Landers, aged about 60, residing on
Third street, San Francisco, sustained in
juries about the small of the back and
chest.- He believes ne is severely injured
internally. Landers was one of the force
on the work train.
"I guess there is little hope for me to
pull through." he said. "I guess it was
an unlucky day for the lot of us. The
whole thing happened so quickly . that we
hardly knew what struck us. We were
going to put in a sidetrack up above Sui
sun, and were expecting to meet Â¦- the
freight train at Cannon, a half-way sta
tion. About a mile and h half from there
we crashed together. The agent at El
mira had O. K.ed the order and started
us from Suisun on the work train. More
than thlB I knew nothing of until I was
picked up after I regained consciousness.
Then I looked about through the thick
fog and saw lying near me three of our
gang dead. They were Callahan, Hughes
and Hearn. There were about forty men
on the work train."
Fireman Harry Waters of the construc
tion train engine had no intimation of ap
proaching danger until the crash came.
"I was busy with my fires," he said,
"and the first thing I knew of any trouble
was when I heard the crash and our
engine seemed to jump ahead a length or
two as though it had been lifted from
the rails. When I looked back I saw a
scene the equal of which in horrifying
detail I hope never to witness again. I
was knocked about the engine cab a little,
but outside of a few black and blue spots
and an awful scare 1 am none the worse
for the accident."
James Davis, familiarly known to the
construction gang as "Brave Jim,", proved
one of the grittiest men among the in
jured. In the awful crash, when timbers
and iron flew about promiscuously, hi*
left leg and the heel of the left foot were
severely crushed, the bones being broken.
As he lay on the stretcher upon a truck
he begged for a drink of water, while
tears, not of sorrow, but caused by in
tense pain, filled his eyes. As he drank
the water bis hand trembled like a leaf,
and, his voice almost choking, he re
marked:
"The poor workmen were tangled up in
the wreckage and their cries and screams
sounded above the hiss of the escaping
steam. As soon as possible members of
the crews who had escaped injury com
menced the work of rescue. The scene
was horrifying. Men were pinioned be
neath heavy timbers, some were under
the trucks and others were thrown to the
sid.e of the track where they were cut and
bruised by the flying splinters."
Mr. Tracey would not venture an opinion
as to the responsibility for the disaster.
A dense fog was hanging over the
marshes and we could not see a car's
length ahead of us. Our orders were to
proceed north of Suleun, - where the work
gang was to put In a siding. I had
slowed up at a crossing and our train
was barely moving when I heard the whis
tle of a locomotive apparently coming up
behind us. I looked back and almost at
the same instant there was a crash. The
three flat cars on which the workmen
were seated were literally lifted into the
air and then fell back upon the track a
mass of splintered wood and twisted iron
Urough which the engine that
with us seemed to be plowing its way.

PETALUMA, Dec. 4.â There may bÂ« a

C. Kelly or Mary C. Appel. who recently
committed suicide by taking carbolic acid.
The estate consists of a ranch near this
city said to be wort- $4000.
The matter came up for probate before
Judge Burnett to-day and J. F. Burns, a
local merchant, presented his petition to
be appointed administrator of- the estate.
He is the guardian of James Kelly and

The sons say they do not think that
Appel,. who alleges the deceased was his

The closest contest was for the office of
City Treasurer, In which the Democratic
candidate, ex-Mayor W. H. Workman,
Snyder carried every ward in the city
except the Fourth and Fifth. The Re
publican candidate 'suffered severely from
the treacherous "trading" of votes, by
which it was sought to save those Council
manic candidates who had been singled
cut by the Los Angeles Times for bitter
attacks. With one exception, every Re
publican nominee upon whom Harrison
Gray Otis vented his spleen was elected.
Snyder's election may be taken to mean
that the municipal ownership of the water
plant. ia still very much of a local issue
and also that sooner or later the people
may be called upon, to decide Just how
far the liquor traffic shall be regulated
by local statutes. Incidentally, the re
sult is taken in certain quarters to have
emphasized the fact that the interference
of the Ministerial Union in local affairs
is not appreciated by a large part of the
local electorate, as it is now being re
called that four years ago, when Synder
was first a Mayoralty candidate, he was
apparently . defeated until the Ministerial
Union indorsed the candidacy of his Re
publican opponent.
LOS ANGELES. Dec. 4.â Politicians
have been rubbing their eyes all day in
their surprised perusal of the figures of
Meredith P. Snyder's victorious vote for
the Mayoralty. The Democratic candi

Chairman, H. K Carter; secretary, Rob
ert. M. Clark. During the afternoon ses
sion this organization was made perma
nent, to last through the meeting of tho
Legislature.
Jf resident Newmark asked that County
Supervisors be empowered to appropriate
money for foreign exhibit purposes. Mr.
Newmark also requested the indorsement
of the national quarantine bill, prohibiting
the importation of infected nursery stock
into the United States. Recommendations
of the Nicaraguan canal bill and of a bill
for the preservation of the big trees of
California were made.
Among other things suggested were the
indorsement of the acts of the
Irrigation Congress and of the recent good
roads convention , and objections to the
ratification of the Jamaica treaty.
Lined up on one side of the room were
representatives of various women's or
ganizations. Miss Elizabeth. L. Kenney
of the Woman's Parliament of Southern
California requested that the law regu
lating the property rights of women bo
amended. She spoke especially of sec
tion 172 of the civil code, which places
community property almost absolutely In
the hand* of the husband.
Mrs. S. R. Woods of Santa Monica, rep
resenting the Woman's Christian Tem
perance Union of Southern California,
presented three measures which will be

suffrage for women, abolishment of the
sale of cigarettes in the State and the
control of the sale of intoxicating liquors
in sanitary districts.

SEATTLE, Dec. 4.â Major Wood, in
charge of the Canadian mounted, police
at Dawson, who makes the royalty collec
tions, reports that the royalty on gold col
lected this year in the Klondike amounts
to nearly $300,000, about JlOo.OOQ more than
last year. Ten per cent of all the gold
taken out of the Klondike is supposed to
be paid to the Government as royalty.
Allowing that all miners have paid roy
alty on all gold taken out In the district
this year, this would make the output of
the Klondike for the fiscal year of 1900,
ending November 30, $9,000,000; but gen
eral estimates place the output at $20,000,
000. Consular certificates issued at the
United States Consul's office at Dawson
show that $14,000,000 was shipped from
May 1 to October 16 this year, demon
strating that much of the royalty was
evaded.

.PARIS, Dec. 4. â General Mercier
caused a deep sensation in the Senate
to-day during the debate on the naval bill
by pointing out. the ease with which Eng
land could be Invaded. -He demanded that
the Government introduce Into , the plans
for mobilization of the army the navy
methods for the rapid embarkation and
debarkation of an expeditionary corps.
The President, M. Fallleres, Intervened,
declaring that such proposals were out
of order.
' In the course of an extraordinary
speech General Mercier said:
"In view of the possibility of war with
Great Britain the UEe of the army is not
sufficiently taken Into account. The times
are not the same as they were a hun
dred years ago. Steam, the navy, the tel
egraph and railroad have rendered the
problem of Invasion of England much
easier of solution. Moreover, Â¦ England
herself is no longer the same. The Trans
vaal has shown that the British army,
although brave, Is. not equal to the task
which England, expected It : to perform.
The British navy. Is powerful,* but It has
many coasts to defend. .. . ;Â¦:
"France, therefore, is numerically . Eng
land's equal at certain points, and Is even
her superior in '. the ; instruments '. of de
etruction.,* History furnishes many in
stances -of mutiny in ') the English navy
at^the moment ; x)f. battle.*: A" landing in
England is. therefore, not beyond realiza-
tion. This Is not only my opinion, but
that also of high naval officers. The
British Premier recently expressed signi
ficant fears, and, if the principle of land
ing is admitted, . the practical means of
execution may be decided.
"I venture to think that the work I pre
pared while commanding an army corps
could serve -as', a basis for 'ouch a project
which would not be expensive."
At this point protests were' raised and
M\Fallleres asked General Mercier not to
enter into the details of the scheme. ,
General Mercier, replied. that. the scheme
could be "held over the head of England
like the nword of Damocles,", and ha pro
posed, a resolution that the Senate should
Invite S the Government to complete Imme
diately preparations for the mobilization
of the army and navy by preparing every
thing, necessary to embark and disembark
as rapidly as possible an expeditionary,

Outburst 5 in a ! j Spirit' of Banter.
LONDON,'.. Dec.', 5.â The ' Morning \Fost
seizes the occasion of General Mercier*s
speech In the French Senate yesterday
to criticize the weakness of the British
defense, which, it says, must be attrib
uted to red tape, but the papers gener
ally treat Mercier's outburst in a spirit
of. banter.
"It is an idea worthy of the courageous
soldier who perjured Dreyfus Into a living
grave, and , who, as Minister of War, sat
shivering with terror during a whole
night at the Elysee lest Germany should
declare . war * against France," says the
Daily Chronicle, and most of the morning
papers comment in a similar strain.
The Daily Graphic says: "We trust that
General Mercler's | harangue will awaken
sober public opinion In France to the dan
gers the republic is courting- by. allowing
Nationalist firebrands so! much license."
- The Standard says: Â¦Â¦:- "The i" incident is
rather encouraging ,to- Englishmen who
esteem I and . respect France; : because it
proves that responsible French statesmen
are not disposed to deal equivocally with
proposals having a ; tendency to disturb
the good 'relations between .the powers."

by Salisbury and Proposes a Scheme to "Hold Over England's Head."

The father remained in France and
brought suit for divorce in the French
courts. He was divorced by the foreign
courts and was also given the custody
of the two children.
Some time after he returned to this

result of the la.Â«t legal flght was the
awarding of the custody of the children

wished the fact of the "proposed recon

Sheriffs were injured,, and as a result the
borough prison Is full of strikers. The in
jured are: Deputy A. K. Baker, ribs
broken; Deputy David Delrick, badly
bruised; Deputy Logan, badly bruised.
It appears that a mob of 600 excited min
ers who are striking came to the works
last night, hooting- and Jeering, and pro
ceeded to camp there, building a bonfire
and then making" a demonstration by
blowing rishhorns and insulting passers
by. Superintendent R. I* Martin, accom
panied by E. P. Dayton, a superintendent
of one of the company's works in the
Connellsville region, was threatened by
the mob, and Mr. Dayton came here and
made an information against some of the
strikers, who were held in $500 bail.
This was the start of the trouble. Late
in the night fighting broke out. Sheriff
May came to the scene of the disturbance
and soon had the injured cared, for and
ten strike leaders locked up in the bor

J| two sessions yesterday. There were
were frult-groxrers present from
every part of the State. President EHwood
Cooper, who has been the leader of Fix
teen annual conventions, was in the chair,
and Secretary I^elong attended to the reg
istration of names. Professor Wickson of
the University cf California occupied the
position of vice president and also oblig
ingly acted as reading clerk.
About 300 fruit-growers -were present.
Chairman Cooper opened the proceedings
by Introducing Rev. Dr. Willey, who of
fered prayer. Then Mr. Cooper delivered
his annual address. He welcomed those
present and spoke at some length. He had
several recommendations to offer. These
were that 1 per cent of the gross sales of
deciduous fruits should be set r a6ide to
provide for a depot in the East for the
better handling of the fruits of California;
that the Legislature should be Invited to
appropriate $10,000 for two years to con
tinue the work of investigating insect
pests and how to combat them; that a
State bureau should be suggested to the
Legislature, with power to prosecute per
sons who violate pure-food laws; that
eome legislation should be had to prevent
the Belgian hare from becoming a pest;
that the Park Commissioners and the
State Board of Trade should be asked to
co-operate to bring the famous obelisk
that stood 1500 years at Heliopolls and 1900
years at Alexandria, and now is in Central
Park, New York, to Golden Gate Park.
The hieroglyphics on the obelisk are chip
ping on* and Mr. Cooper thought that the
California climate would preserve the
precious historical and scientific relic.

His last report of expenditures is found

more than that sum for telegraph and

The length of time in transit detract* from
the value of fruit, and Irregularity tends to
demoralize markets; for instance, I shipped a
car of Bartlett pears from Bulsun to Cleve
land, Ohio, on July 11 of this year and a
similar car to the same place on the 14th.
Both cars were received and sold on Thurs
day, the 26th, following:, one car being fifteen
days and the other twelve days on the road.
Both were reported over-rlpÂ« and in poor con
dition, and sold accordingly. The receipt of
the fruit in such an irregular manner caused
two cars to be sold on the same day when
they Bhould have been sold three, days apart.
The length of .time required In transit caused
the fruit to be . exposed for sale In an over
ripe condition necessitating its immediate use,
and it had to be sold to seddlers and the like,
which always means low prices. â¢ Many cars
of fruit that, were sold f. o. b. to outside Kast
ern points were -rejected simply, on account of
being overripe. These were generally diverted
to the auction rooms and helped to still further
fieprees the market. These are only instances
all shippers have had the same experiences; in
fact it was. the general experience this year.
They -servs to illustrate the point 1 wleh to

there was no effort made to favor the shipment
of perishable fruits, for at the time we re

and complaint was made of the 26,000 min

also of an answer from Mr. Sproule. In
the answer Mr. Sproule said that the ser

Mr. Mills discussed the chances for ad
vertising California fruits at the Pan-
American Exposition, to be held at Â«uf-Â»
falo next year. There would be an at
tendance of from 60,000 to 100,000 per day.
California has been offered a large share
of the space In the Horticultural build
ing. He had corresponded with W. I.
Buchanan, director general at Buffalo,
concerning the concession for selling
preen fruit on the Exposition grounds.
The Buffalo people were willing to let the
concession to a firm or to an individual,
but would not agree that California fruit
alone, should be sold. Mr. Mills courted
the opportunity to have fruit grown in
other. States sold beside the California
fruit for purposes of comparison. Mr.
Mills said that California fruit can be laid
down in European countries cheaper than
it can be growiv there. . Distribution is

Benjamin Ide Wheeler was announced to
read a paper, but he did not appear. The
general topic of the afternoon was the
review of the year's fruit shipments, dis
tribution, transportation and freight rates
and marketing fruit and fruit products.
The discussion grew out of the reports
and led td the appearance on the floor of
William Sproule of the Southern Pacific
Company, who explained to the fruit
growers the reasons given by the rail
road people for the slow moving of de
ciduous fruits to the Eastern market. He
also promised the convention that he
would take up, with Eastern railroad men,
personally, next February and March, the
matter of giving better service. He put
the blame on the Eastern lines. The con

H. Weinstock of .Sacramento reported
concerning the season'* operations of the
California Fruit Growers and Shippers'
Association. On the whole the results of
the season's shipment was disappointing
because of poor packing, particularly of

ARTHUR DE BRUHL, eon of W. J.
de Bruhl. local manager for Ar

chants, is missing and detectives
are trying to r.nd the young man
for his anxious parents. It is rumored
that an ii-.fatuaUon for a dashing young
Stockton woman is the cause of his dis
appearance.
Young de Bruhl is employed with Leon
ard & Ellis, lubricating oil refiners of 41S
Kront Ftreet, as an assistant bookkeeper.
A Tx-f-c-k ago last Saturday be secured a
leave of absence for a few davs on the
pretext that he intended going down into
fcanta Clara County with a chum on a
hunting- trip. When the time for him to
rttL.ru had passed and he did not appear.
*.i* father became uneasy and began to
invesiicate. casually at first and then
with more system as the mystery deep
ened. The young man's whereabouts Is
â¢Uil ur.knÂ«.tin and d. tecilves are search
ing (iilipentiy for him in Saa Francisco,
Elockton and the towns of Sania Clara
Count'-.
The young bookkeeper is only 19 years
old. liis parents live at present at the
Granaca. WOO Gutter street, where they
lately movfd frÂ«>in a fayhionabie Bush
*trÂ»-H family hotel. They are wr-11 known
in society and Arthur is the elder of two
s -Â«)i.j i:.(f idol of nis father and
nioth*r. A year ago his father secured
: : .m the position with Leonard & Ellis.
I'iannir.g to have- him acquire a practical
kr.owlecjre cf business life- as preparation
tor ( n.inrction later with the lirm of Ar
boekle Brothers in a more responsible
position.
J> Bruhl Junior is a young man of
phasing; manner and happv-go-lucky dis
poftltioa that soon won for him the frien<l
ehip of his associates in the Front-street
hou.-*-. He was looked upon as a fortun
*.!â¢=â¢ young man who would be able to suc
ceed and rise in the commercial world
with only a modicum of effort on account
of th* potency of his father's Influence.
But he was genial and companionable
and won the grÂ»od will of his lets fortun
ate fellow-employes.
The house of Leonard & Ellis has a
2< Deroos way with the men in its office,
fend if ocraslonally on<Â» of them desirus
a ff-w days' leave of absence it is granted
readily, and if the employe stretches the
few -Jays into a week and comes back
Â«rflUnj{ lÂ« take up the routine of his work
after a brief gambol along the primrose
path they ask no question?, but reinstate
him readily in their good graces.
When young De Bruhl did not return
at the appointed time and his father sot
on foot an inquiry, it was found that he
had not gone to the Santa Clara County
ranch where he had pretended he was
going, and his parents at once became
very much worried over his absence.
De Bruhl consulted with F. J. Finch,
manager for Leonard & Ellis, and was
assured that his eon's accounts with the
lirm were perfectly straight. The young
man had occasionally made collections
considerable in amount, but an examina
tion of his books showed that there was
not the slightest discrepancy anywhere,
at any rate bo far a* could be discovered
tor the time.
Some of The associates of young De
Bruhl, it Is said, knew of an infatuation
which had taken possession of him for a
dashing young Stockton woman. It is
rumored that he found favor in her eyes
in spite of hiB extremely youthful appear
ance, on account of her belief that he. had
money to burn in large rolls, with a fat
bank account to draw upon and with
rosf-ate prospects for the future.
As a result of this knowledge search is
being conducted for the missing youth
in Siockton and neighboring towns as well
as In the Santa Clara Valley towns and
in Han Francisco. He stayed one night
at a downtown hotel and then disap
rÂ«-arp<l. a day ahead of the sleuths that
were on his trail. It is thought probable
that he is in some lodging-house in San
Francisco, leaving the pleasures of the
liunt to the detectives who are after him.
"The young man will turn up alp right,"
Manager Kinch of Leonard & Ellis, said
yesterday afternoon. "We are not worry
ing about him. He has been a steady,
trustworthy employe, and his position is
dik-n to him when he shall return. It is
nothing more than a boyish escapade,
which, of course. 1b causing his father
Hnd mother no end of anxiety, but he will
come out of It all right. Woman in the
rase? Oh, no, that is scarcely probable.
The boys who know him are making all
kind? of g-uess.es. but none of them know
anything tangible."
Some- of. the fellow-employes of young
De Bruhl are inclined to scout the Stock
ton woman theory. They say that he
probably got tired of the drudgery of
bookkeeper and took the mysterious dis
appearance method of securing a good
rÂ«n and possibly arrangements for the
future" more to his liking.

Senator Perkins' desk and wonder if It

Sai'die- Back From Nortlherini QoIdfleldsV
EL DORADO. Kane.. Dec. 4.â To-day in
the Jessie Morrison murder trial the time
was spent In an effort on the part of the
prosecution to prove the authenticity of a
deathbed statement ol Mrs. Castle, which
it was desired to introduce as evidence.
Two physicians, Mrs. Castles pastor.
Rev. Mr. Wharton; his wile and daughter,
*nd Augustin Brumback. brother oi the
prosecuting attornev in tne case, depicted
ihÂ£ scene at the bedside of the dying
woman. They told how she. unable to
epeak because of the wounds in her
tnroat. nodded assent as questions per
taining to the aitair with Miss Morrison
were put to her. and how finally she
signea her name to the statement and
wrote the woras, "By ray OJod. it is true."
The statement declared that Jessie Mor
rison had provoked the quarrel with the
dead woman and then clashed her with a
razor.
A. thrilling scene occurred during the
cross-examination of Ururnback. He had
been requested to ttll what questions he
had asked and what answers he had re
ceived while he was taking Mrs. Castle's
statement. To answer the question Brum
back related the statement made by the
wounded woman, described the approach
of Jessie Morrison to Mrs. Castle s home
end told of the preliminary conversation
between the two voting women. As Brum
back proceeded his voice grew loud and
Ills speech emphatic. His npht arm went
out in decisive gestures until hq reached
the point where he said that Jessie Mor
rison handta Mr?. Castle a letter *to read,
and that while the latter perused it the
prisoner "took out her razor and cut her
throat." As he said this Brumback sprang
to his Ceet and dramatically passed his
hand through the air as if he clutched a
razor.
Mrs. Wiley, mother of the murdered
woman, pui her handkerchief over her
face at if to hide the picture, and Olin
Castle's mother covered her eyes with her
hand. Every head in the courtroom was
immovable, with all iyes straining for
Â¦n-ard. Jessie- Morrison never flinched. She
looked siraipht In frolit of her. and aside
from the fact that her cheeks grew a lit
ile whiter as she closed her eyes for a
minute as Brumback concluded her ex
pression did not change. Olln Castle was
not in the ccurtroom.

Some women objected to the
faint odor which came from the
old yellow
COTTOLENE.
. (In most cases they overheated
it â burned it.)
It was not an objectionable
odor like that from -boiling cab-
bage, but- - . ,
- Itwis a new one
And so we decided to do
away with the odor entirely.
The result is shown in
WHITE COTTOLENE,
odorless, neutral.
"It looks good enough to eat,"
and it's looks dmit belie it

PRESIDENT OF THE WORCESTER OREAD rNSTTTUTION. WHO
FINDS THE ORIGIX OF CRIME, CANCER AND LUNACY IN THE
MEAT STAPLE OF OLD ENGLAND.
THE tenth annual meeting of the
New York "Vegetarian Society waa
held â¢ recently at Metaphysical
Hall, Fifth avenue and Fortieth
street. Instead of the usual busi
ness' the society listened with great inter
est to an address by Henry D. Perky,
president of the Worcester (Mass.) Oread
Institution, a free school for girls, every
State and Territory in the country being
represented.
The hall was well filled, principally by
ladies, who appeared to be the speaker's
special target. Â¦
Mr. Perky's subject was "Naturally Or
ganized Food Makes Possible Natural
Conditions." He is especially qualified
to treat the matter, as he has long been
a student of food questions and, a pro
moter of a new way In diet. ; , /
"There is nothing In this wide world,"
he said, "to assure success except to
start right. Chauncey M. Depew recent
ly said, 'Some people are born rich, some
fortunate and others in Ohio.' I am of
the latter. My object here Is to tell
mothers how to rear children."
"Won't you please speak a little
louder?" exclaimed one young lady wear
ing a big hat. " ;
Mr. Perky took a swallow of water,'
asked the secretary^ to close the windows
to keep out the street noise, and then re
torted:
"And now will the lady and others In
the hall please remove their hats, so that
those eittingr behind them need not rub
ber-neck this way and that in order to see
me?"
Then he resumed his discourse by tell
ing of the evil effects of too much beef
eating. He said:
"When I quit eating beef about eight
years ago I began to receive that normal
condition which a man should enjoy be
fore he can become a successful business
man. I have not eaten beef since then.
About nine years ago I read a newspaper
paragraph about the rapid Increase of
cancer in England. It was then discov
ered' that cancer was most prevalent
among well-to-do men and women, the
beef eaters, whereas it was scarcely
known among the common people, who
get little beef to eat."
He compared the hunuin being to the
bucksaw, which worked badly when not
properly sharpened and set or -was rusty.
"The country Is full of drunkards," he
said, "the jails full of criminals, and
the asylums full of insane, all bo
cause they have not been properly edu
cated In the. way they should live or care
for their stomachs. Their heads are filled
with book knowledge, but they have very
little intelligence."

TheÂ» prime spirits of Tanforan are learning that
sometimes the shadow of an evil name is as bad as

Chinese generals and diplomats hive reached the
conclusion. 'that we can do no more than talk. At the
same time our. oriental friends appear to have no par

â¢ A citizen- who voted against a certain attorney for
legislative honors has been refused as a juror in a
case now pending in a local court. This is one of the
penalties which should be accepted as a prize.
The Oakland woman who fired a bullet into her
consort's body and now insists upon nursing him
back to life appears to be carrying too far the tradi
tional privilege of inconsistency, which her sex enjoys.

we of the First District arc more con

Editorial Opinion From All Parts of the State
on Matters of Interest.
SPIRIT OF CALIFORNIA PRESS
It is gratifying that the Fruit-growers' Convention,
is giving attention to the subject. In fact, the repre
sentatives of all lines of industry and commerce in'
the State ought to take part in the work of 'prepar-'.
ing for a comprehensive State exhibit. The exposi
tion is not going to be a small one by. any means, and
California ought to take a conspicuous place among
the States that are foremost in quantity, variety and
quality of exhibits.
.. Furthermore, it is; to be. remembered the Bureau of
American. Republics has now ' become well estab
lished and has developed a wide field of activity in
promoting trade between ourselves and other Ameri
can countries. Thus everything is well prepared for
promoting any line of trade that may be started as a
result of the exposition. In fact, the great fair is to
come at a most opportune time, for it coincides -with
a new industrial and commercial, movement through
out the world, and with a'gathering in Mexico" de
signed.for the express purpose of fostering that very
trade- which it is the object of the exposition to pro-
For some time past there have been reports of thfc
existence of an ill-feeling among the South Ameri
cans against the people of the United States growing
out of their racial sympathy with the Spanish during
the war. The reports may have had a foundation of
tiuth, but they appear to have been greatly
ated. At any rate there has been" no official mani
festation of antagonism to us nor any sign of indif
ference toward the exposition. In his message the
President announced that the Latin-American states
have evinced the liveliest interest in the Pan-
American Congress which is to assemble in the City
of Mexico, and he draws from that fact encourage
ment for the hope that, at the exposition the display
of exhibits from those countries will be much larger
than they would have bee*n had not the International
Congress. been called. < v > "<>>.
THE BUFFALO EXPOSITION.
CALIFORNIA'S int-erest in the trade of South
and Central America and Mexico is. certainly
inferior to that of any other section of the
Union, and consequently the pan-American exposi
tion to be held at Buffalo next year is one in which
we should take part and make the best showing pos
sible of all lines of goods for which there is likely to
be any demand either in the countries south of us or
in our own Eastern States.
There have been times when if Mr. Bryan had said,
*'I will not keep silent for money, but I will not keep
.silent without it," large sums could have been raised
to keep him still. The country was so tired of him.
But now its fatigue has been expressed in a vote, in
which ht wins Idaho. Montana, Colorado and Ne
vada, and the Southern States where he did not
Speak, and loses ?11 the States where he did, and peo
ple feel better and arc indifferent whether anybody
pays him anything for what he thinks he thinks, or
not.
A careful search of all that he has said heretofore
fiils to reveal the least indication of consideration and
study of the subject. His method has*been what the
old Hoosier lady called "ad claptrapanddrum." Let
us be thankful that he is going to consider and study
hereafter, for that means a long and desirable silence.
Then. too. it may be that he will really get some
ideas in his head; he may learn something. The
ccuntry will turn a grateful ear to the -profound si
lence in which he will wrap himself, and will hope
that nobody will lure him out of it with a bank check.
Hereafter it is. "Drop a coin in the slot and get a
carefully considered opinion.*' as- far as Colonel
Bryan is concerned. When it comes to talk, money
must speak first. We think he is the first public man
h; the United States who puts a newspaper interview
on the C. O. D. basis. Taking one's ryes off the so-
did aspect of his declaration, one is compelled to ad
mit that, after all. he has learned something. In very
turbid English and rather primitive grammar he lets
the world know that hereafter he will not discuss sub
jects of importance, except for money, nor until "after
consideration and study."
Recently the Record Bent a reporter to him for an
interview. "The peerless one" refused, saying: 'I
am not writing for money, but I will not write with
out it. If I were to discuss subjects of importance I
should wish to do so only after consideration and
study, and I should wish to prepare a careful state
ment at my, leisure. If I should be willing to give in
terviews on all these questions the newspapers would
keep me bus-y practically all the lime, and I should
find that when I came to write for myself I had prac
tically printed much of it before."

didacy much aid and comfort in the dark days

UTTERANCE
IN VARIETY
The problem of providing for public safety, then,
appears to be the only one that remains to be solved
in the work of providing an. electric substitute for
steam on railways. Human ingenuity that ha*s
achieved such wonders in recent years will not long be
baffled by a difficulty of that kind, and it is quite pos
sible, therefore, that a large mileage of electric rail
way for freight and passenger service may soon be
in operation in all parts ol the Union.
While the results of experiments have been received
with general gratification, it is noted that the new im
provement, like every other, brings something of evil
in its train and is not an unmixed benefit. The third
rail is a potent means of electric propulsion, but it is
dangerous. Commenting upon the operation of the
system in that city the Brooklyn Eagle says: "All in
all, the 'third rail' system appears to have produced
more practical results than any competing device.
But what about its safety? l On the Brooklyn elevated
road it has had a number of fatal mishaps during. the
short time it has been in operation, and how will it
be in a road laid on the ground? Will it be safe
at grade crossings? May people walk along the
tracks with impunity, as now, subject only to the
danger of being run over by a train? If not, then
the third rail system cannot expect universal or even
widespread adoption."
The authorities of the Vanderbilt system are under
stood to have set their technical staff to work to de
vise some means of substituting electricity! for steam
in hauling their cars through the tunnels in the city
from the Grand Central Depot to Harlem River. They
have not been satisfied with the overhead trolley, but
it is now believed the third rail method may solve the
difficulty.
Both experiments are reported to have been suc
cessful. It is said that on the Hudson and Albany
road "heavy cars holding sixty passengers each trav
eled easily thirty-five miles in fifty-five minutes," and
it is added/ "Electricians present that electricity
would supplant steam on all railroads in the near
future."
Interest in the subject has been renewed by the
recent opening of an electric line from Hudson to
Albany, N. Y., paralleling the Hudson River Rail
road, and designed to do a general railway business,
carrying freight as well as passengers. .It is said to
be the first venture of the kind on a large scale, and
i? therefore being studied with a good' deal of atten
tion. Local interest in New York*was. increased' in
the enterprise by the fact that on the same day the
road between Albany and Hudson was opened an
experiment was made in operating the Manhattan
elevated railway by the same method of electric pro
pulsion, that known as the "third rail" system;
LONG DISTANCE ELECTRIC RAILWAY
S'OME time ago we directed attention to an ex
perimental trip made -by a party .of. tourists
fron^ Boston to New York by various electric
lines operating between the two cities. It was then
pointed out that while the experiment showed that
the 'trolley lines do not constitute a serious compe
tition to steam railways, their weakness' in that re
spect was .largely due* to the fact that they had not
been constructed for that purpose; that they did not
form a single direct line and were not designed for
long^ distance traveling. Consequently the failure of
the experiment of using trolley lines for. journeys be
tween thg two cities did not conclusively; establish the
superiority of steam over electricity for long roads.
The President's declaration that the party in power
is pledged to a distributive reform will be gratifying
to the farmers, miners, stock men and other business
men who must use their credit remote from the con
gested money centers.
This is a complete exposition of the benefits pi
more equal distribution as against the congestion of
currency in money centers.
Mr. Brough, commenting on the Canadian system
of banking, says: "The per capita statisticians would
have us believe that we are hopelessly dependent upon
the volume of the precious metals for our medium of
exchange, and yet Canada maintains a paper circula
tion of $16 40 per head on a metallic base of $2 64
per capita, without the least strain to her credit;
while in the United States our paper currency aver
ages $16 40 per head, with a metallic base of $11 36
per head. As the proportion of metallic . money to
credit is three times greater in the United States than
it is in Canada, the difference against us, amounting
to $378,673,355, may be regarded as just so much pro
ductive capital abstracted from industry and con*
verted into dead capital, for no one can doubt our
ability to maintain as large a proportion of credit
currency as Canada, if we will but adopt the proper
legislative measures."
Mr. Conant, in his "History of Banks of Issue,"
referring to the Scotch banks, says'> "The proof of
the large savings of the Scotch people, and their gen
eral use of banking facilities, may be found in the
bank returns of the United Kingdom for 1894. These
returns show that, in spite of the enormous wealth
and banking business concentrated in London, the
deposit liabilities of the Scotch banks divided by
the population of Scotland show a per capita average
of Â£27, while those of England show an average of Â£22.
The ten Scottish banks of issue have now over 000
offices, or branches, or one for every 4500 people,
men, women and children. The gain of economy in
this perfect distribution of currency is proved by the
fact that Scotland has carried on its business with a
circulation of Â£3,500.000, while in England the circu
lation is from Â£50,000,000 to Â£60,000,000, or, allowing
for the difference in population, England has re
quired a currency thrc; times greater than Scotland."
The President says significantly: "The party in
power is committed to such legislation as will make
the currency responsive to the varying needs of busi
ness at all seasons and in all sections."
As a result of the establishment of these new banks
and permission to issue notes to the par value of the
bonds which secure them, the increase in the na
tional bank note issue between March 14 and Novem
ber 30 of this year was $77,899,570.
A partial remedy for this condition has been found
in the provision of the gold standard law which per
mits the organization of banks with $25,000 capital,
and authorizes their issue of currency up to the par
value of the bonds deposited with tlie treasury to se
cure it. The President notes that under this law 369
banks have organized, of which 266 have a capital of
less than $50,000, and 103 have a capital of_ $50,000, or
more. These banks are mostly in the West. Iowa,
in which the head center of financial folly was long
located, and where greenbackism became formidable,
even electing Calamity Weller twice to Congress upon
his promise to secure, "a more and a fittener cur
rency," has thirty of these new banks, able to locally
supply the needs of the State for currency. Texas,
Oklahoma, the Indian Territory and the West and
Southwest generally, have^taken advantage of this
greater freedom of banking, and it is worth while to
notice that a reduction in the unsound money vote
has followed the line of these improved banking fa
cilities.
All the time it was rot a question of the volume of
money, but of its distribution. It was congested in
the centers, in the cities, and the cquntry was left with
too little while the cities had too much.
It was seen by students of the political situation early
in the adolescent stage of greenbackism that heresies
on the money question were being propagated be
cause of the cost and difficulty that attended the use
of credit in sections of the country remote from the
financial centers. In this arose the theory that money
must be sent from New York or even released from
the Federal treasury at certain seasons "to move the
crops." It was by use of this theory that Grant's ad
ministration was played with by Gould and Fisk in
the financial tragedy of "the Black Friday." Under
that theory of a currency the money transferred to a
distance to meet an emergency soon returned to its
source, and when the--real necessities of the farmer,
which occur' at seedtime, appeared, he found himself
obliged to use his credit in the most indirect and ex
pensive way, . Usually it was possible to use it at
all only at the local store, where he paid for it by a
smart advance in prices upon his time purchase.
Thence the credit was handed on by the storekeeper
to the wholesaler in the commercial and financial cen
ter, and when the money came to the country to move
the crops in the fall it was a mere bird of passage.
The farmer took it for his crop, paid ft at the country
store in discharge of his long and costly credit, and
the country store immediately sent it back to the cen
ter in discharge of his debt to the city wholesaler. In
that way it evaporated, was lost to any use beneficial
to the agricultural business man and left him in con
dition unimproved, to repeat the same costly and in
direct use of his credit when seedtime again compelled
him to employ it. It may be truthfully said that this
inconvenient and costly method of employing credit
was the cause of one-half the farm mortgages that
were recently the bogy conjured by financial quacks
to demonstrate the necessity for more money.
OF necessity the greater part of the President's
message is taken up with a discussion of Chi
nese matters and information upon the vexed
questions that go with our external . policy.
But there are matters that take less space that are. by
no means secondary in importance. Indeed, while the
foreign and external relations of the Government re
quire always a longer statement, because they often
transpire only through the annual message, having oc
curred beyond the daily note and vision of the peo
ple, it may be truly said that they are really second
ary to domestic policy and affairs which are the home"
concern of all the people.

cause with the police in the effort to
stamp out the commission of crime by the
use of "knockout drops." Yesterday
John Williams and W. Johnston, who
were arrested by Detectives Fitzgerald
and Graham and Policeman Pendergast
in the Mission and when searched were
found to have bottles of the "drops" In
their possession, were convicted on a
charge of vagrancy ln Judge Fritz's court
and were each sentenced to six months ln
the County Jail, which is the limit. C. L.
Morgan, the City Chemist, testified that
the stuff ln the bottles was what la
commonly known as "knockout drops'*
and would soon put a man to sleep.
Louis Cuneo, alias Horan, who was ar

of vagrancy and was sent to the County
Jail for three months. The Judge said
that as It was the first case of the kind
that had come before him he would not
infliot the full penalty, but he would not
be so lenient the next time.

on the night of November 24: Elsie M.
Kelly, Dora Rosner, Rofena C. May, Con
rad L.. Drlefer, Bertha C. Drlefer and An
nie L. Gruenhagen. Henry B. and Annie
E. Madison were to have been initiated
that evening, but they were unavoidably
detained. That meeting, the last business
one of the term of Mrs. Alice Frances
Hickle, the worthy matron, was at
tended by nearly two hundred per
sons, members of the order, and was held
In the beautiful hall of'the Mission Ma
sonic Temple. Among the well known
members of the order were: Mrs. 3. E.
Chesney, past grand matron, of Kansas;
M. Mixs, past grand patron of the same
jurisdiction; Past Grand Patron Darlinp,
Past Grand Organist Mrs. Darling, Grand
Secretary Mrs. Willats, Mrs. Frances
Bonnlfleld, matron of Ivy Chapter; Mrs.
Emma Carter, matron of Harmony Chap
ter; a number of the officers elect of the
local chapters and many past patrons and
matrons; also Venerable Past Grand
Patron \V. S. Moses, whose grandniece,
Miss E. M. Kelly, was admitted \ into
membership. After the work of the even
ing the venerable past patron delivered
an interesting address,- after which there
was an adjournment to the banquet hall,
where an excellent supper was served.
This chapter, under the matronship of
Mrs. HicKie, has had a most wonderful
record, one that any chapter might envy.
It gained sixty in membership and all its
meetings, whether on initiation night or
on ordinary business nights, were attend
ed by from one hundred and fifty to two
hundred members and visitors. A great
many visited because they all agreed that
"Mrs. Hlckie is such a lovable lady and
such a good and pleasant officer." After
every meeting the chapter always had an
hour of sociability and the matron and
her officers, who all acted in sisterly and
brotherly harmony, did all that could be
done to make the chapter room one of the
most pleasant in the local Jurisdiction.
The new officers of this chapter will be
installed on the 8th inst.
The officers of Golden Gate Chapter will
be installed on the 6th inst. The cere
mony will be to members of the order
only.
The Installation of the new officers of
Olive Branch Chapter, an extended no
tice of which appeared in The Call of last
Thursday, was one of the events of the,
week. The chapter under the guidance of
Mrs. Rose M. Plstolesi, the new matron,
and Dr. de Witt, the new patron, together
with the well chosen corps of, officers who
will assist them, will no doubt during the
current Eastern Star year maintain the
reputation that it attained under the di
rection of Miss McConkey, one of the
brightest officers that ever filled the sta
tion of matron.
Last week the officers of Ivy Chap
ter, whose term will expire In a few
days, held their last business meeting In
Golden Gate Hall, on which occasion
there were present about 200 members of
the order. The hall was decorated with
evergreens and the several stations cov
ered with calla lilies, chrysanthemums and
pinks, while the points of the central star
were provided with new chairs and table
in white enamel and gold, the handsomest
In any of the local chapters. There were
initiated five candidates in a manner that
Â¦won for the officers many words of warm
commendation. The music during the cer
emony was bv a choir composed of Flor
ence Perkins, James E. Gordon, Mrs. Car
rie Gordon, D. M. Lawrance and Mrs.
Warren. At the close of the beautiful
ceremony all present marched to the large
banquet hall below, where . there was
served a most excellent BUpper prepared
under the personal supervision of the
chairman of the committee. Mrs. Minnie
Fidellia Wallis, the conductress-elect. It
was served on tables that were most
tastefully decorated, and a feature of the
supper was Thanksgiving turkeys. The
lateness of the hour at which the entree
was made in the banquet hall prevented
the worthy matron, Mrs. Frances Boni
fleld, from calling on a number selected
to respond to sentiments, but there were
words of encouragement from Mrs. Alice
Frances Hlckie. matron of Mission Chap
ter, vocal selections by D. M. Lawrance
and James Gordon and a few words from
T. H. Selvege, an outsider, a specially in
vited guest to the supper.

also present twenty-six members of the
Past Arches' Association, who paid their
first visit to any grove since organization.
The visitors were v/ell received, but there
wa.s a little disappointment, as there were
no candidates to be Initiated The visit
ing officials gave the groves some sound
advice, expressing the hope that they
would follow the pace of the other groves
and make ,a showing of numerical in
crease before the meeting of the next
Grand Grove. After the close of business
there was an adjournment to the banquet
hall, where a tine collation was served,
and there were addresses for the good of
the order by the visiting officials. Past
Noble Grand Arch Judge Bahrs, District
Deputy. Hutton, and many others, some
of the a.ddres5es being In English and oth

COUNTY GRAND JURY
Judge Smith Calls Attention to Seri
ous Charge Made Against
Officials.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 4.â When tha
county Grand Jury was impaneled this
morning in the Superior Court, Judge
Smith brought to its attention matters
that are likely to result In sensational de
velopments.
"I do not know of any misconduct in of
fice committed by any one in this county,"
said the Judge. "If I did It would be my
duty to notify you of the same. I do call
your attention, however, to' very serious
charges recently made against our Police
Department through a committee of our
fellow citizens. I think it proper for you,
at the proper time, to send for witnesses
and investigate these charges.' *
The Judge had reference to the recent
report of the committee of fifteen citizens
which investigated the various depart
ments of the city government and brought
serious accusations against the Police
Commissioners and others.
Referring to the trial of Walter H. Wat
son for the murder of W. J. Breckenrldge
the Judge further said:
"The attorney for the defense for this
caee said In his argument before the jury
!n open court, that he knew who had com
mitted this murder and that the guilty
party was living not ten blocks from the
County Courthouse in this city. He also
accused the District Attorney's office of
knowing to whom he referred. I think
you should send for this attorney and In
quire into this matter. The name of the
attorney Is Earl Rogers."
The court then appointed Thomas Lewis
foreman of the Jury. The Jury retired to
Its rooms, organized and adjourned.

WHITES MURDEROUSLY
ASSAULT TWO CHINESE
One Asiatic Killed and Another Se
riously Injured in Their
Cabin.
PORTLAND, Dec. 4.â Four white men
assaulted two Chinese last night near
Rlley, Washington County, killing one
known as "Charley" and severely wound
ing "Louey," his friend. "Louey," al
though badly beaten, will probably re
cover. He says that they were awakened
last evening shortly after 10 o'clock by a
knocking upon the door of their cabin.
Upon opening it several men rushed in.
striking him upon the head and shooting
his companion. He believes there were
four men, but is not certain about the
number, as it was dark and he was con
siderably dazed by the blows rained upon
him. The murderers no -doubt believed
both Chinese to be dead when they left.
"Louey" believes one of the party was
a man for whom he had worked some
time ago. "Luey" had trouble with ,him
over the price paid him while at work and
believes that revenge was the motive ot
the attack. -^

Five favorites were retired from busi
ness during the racing matinee at Oak
land yesterday and the talent smiledâ but
it. was not on the level. The bookies fin
ally had an inning, and many of them
needed it, for a skeletonized bank roll
can't stand the punishment a portly one
can. The sensation of the afternoon was
furnished by Gauntlet, a sometimes good
and other times bad sample of horseflesh,
which ran one and a quarter miles, with
IjN pounds up, in 2:05^, a new coast rec
ord. The event was fourth on the card,
with ten entered at various selling prices.
Gauntlet was quoted at 6 and " to 1, and
â¢\Happy" Mounce nearly broke both fctlr
rups restraining the chestnut horse, al
most from flagfall. At the wire he fin
lfcbed a neck ahead of Opponent, with
Koenig a close third. The Bobby, backed
to 11 to 5 favoritism, could not stand the
cllj>. linishing fourth.
The gia_nt Herculean had Eddie Jones
on his back in the opening sprint and
cleverly disposed of a big field at odds of
<in to 1. Diomed. a brother to OUnthus
and Ulg-gs. dropped into the place ahead
of Decoy, at odds of 50 to 1. The favorite,
l'oul Play, early drew out of the game.
6everal times in the past Jim Hale, a
two-year-old owned by W. L. Btanlield,
ha? been tipped as "the goods. In Lhe
tccond event 10 to 1 was laid about him
and he came in on the bit, the easiest Kind
of a winner over Raveling, the 4 to s> fa
vorite. The winner was well played by
those who keep posted on workouts and
end staJl yarns. â¢ j'f-,_
Quite a spectacular finish marked the
close of the mile felling run. when Sir
Kingston, Campus and the favorite, Aloe,
nr.ifhed heads on the wire, in the order
named. Fir Kingston, excellently ridden
I y Jack Martin, almost went begging for
friends at P and 10 to 1. Had Mounce not
indulged In so many liberties with Alee
the favorite would probably have scored.
Green Morris' two- year-old Bedeck met
Gold Or at three-quarters In the fifth
number, and took the older horse Into
camp. Bedeck closed a 4 to 5 chance, and
Â»t the wire was about all out to win by
â¢ lenjrth in 1:13.
Darn Fountain held a stack of tickets
on Montal!aÂ»1e. winner of the closing race,

New Record Holder Rao Under Wraps Greater Part
of the Route â Five Favorites Go Down.
BERKELEY, Dec. 4.â As the result of
a successful football season half of the
big debt which has been contracted by
the students of the University of Cali
fornia during the past few years will be
paid. The work of Graduate Manapar
Reno Hutchinson has "been very success
ful. Another season such as this will see
the student body free from indebtedness.
The Associated - Students owe. $450').
Nearly half of this sum is the Glee Club
debt which . the collpge assumed. The
other amounts were contracted . from, time
to time by various athletic ve-ntures.
This has been a very successful football
year. The proceeds of the Thanksgiving
game were larger than ever before. Man
ager Hutchinson estimates the total re
ceipts at $26,000, or ?4<KX) more than last
year. The expenses of the day were JCOOO,
about the same as usual. Each college re
ceived. $250 from the manager of the sou
venir programme. Besides getting' half
of the receipts of the. game and $250 for
souvenir privileges California got $400
from the Thanksgiving show at the Tiv
oll. This will bring Berkeley's total re
ceipts to $10,650, as afraiuBt $8000 last year.
The expenses of a football game are
large. The bleachers cost $3200 and the
rent of grounds $750. The officials were
paid $350. This, with Incidental expenses,
such as printing, labor and so on, brings
the total up to J6000.
Large sums of monev are used during
the training season. The trainlne table
cost about $1000, or half the usual figure.
Coach Kelly was paid $2000 and the train
ers $550. The manager's salary amounted
to $600. Suits and other athletic equip
ments cost more than $1000; drugs and
labor about $700.
Manager Hutchinson collected $1200 In
associate student dues and made the same
amount from the Bale of season tickets.
By the freshman game California made
1400. The gate receipts at the preliminary
games, outside of season tickets, paid the
expenses. For these urellminary games
Reliance got $675, Oregon $250, Nevada $125.
Football Convention.
BERKELEY. Dec. 4.â The executive
committee of the student body of the
University of California has issued a call

ABOUT HEART DISEASE.
Ninety Per Cent of It Really Caused
From Poor Digestion.
Real organic heart trouble ie Incurable,
but prarcely one case in a hundred Js
crpanlc.
The artion of the heart and stomach are
both controlled by the Fame great nerves,
the sympathetic airl pneumogastric. and
when the Ftotnach ;alliÂ« to properly digest
th<Â» food and it lies in the f-tomaeh fer-
mrniingr pa?Â»s are formed Â¦which distend
th.' firpan. causing pressure on the heart
ard lungv rausing palpitation. Irregular-
ity and shortness of breath.
The dancer from this condition is that
the continued disturbance of the heart
. Â«oor;er or later may cause real organic
heart trouble, and In fact frequently
does so.
Furthermore, poor digestion makes the
blood tliin and watery and deficient In red
corpuscles, and th.s further Irritates and
weaken!! the hrart.
The most FtnMble thing to do for heart
trouble is to insure the digestion and as-
fcimilation of the food.
This can be done by the repuiar use
r.fter meal* of *ome safe, pleasant and
rffertive digestive preparation, like
' Btuart'a Dyepepsli Tablets, which may
lÂ»e found at most drug rtorps and Â¦which
contain the necessary digestive elements
in a pleasant, convenient form.
Thousands of people keep well and vig-
orous by keeping their digestion perfect
â¢ by observing the rule of taking one or
two of these tablets after each meal, or at
least after each hc-arty meal.
Stuarts Dysp.'pMa Tablets contain U S.
P. pepsin, diastase from malt and other
natural diKc-sUve? which act only on the
!oo6. difc-estinu it perfectly and preventing
nc-idlty. pases and many diseased condi-
tions which accompany a weak stomach
â¢\ When Stuarts Dyspepsia Tablets are
UFf-d you may know you are not taking
Into the i=Â»tem any strong medicine or
powerful druK. but dimply the natural dl-
peptive elements which every week stom-
ach lack.Â«.
So Widely known and popular have these
.tablets become that they are now sold in

Weekly Call, $1 per Year
FRESNO, December 4th, 1000.
M. THEO. KEARNEY, President
PROSPECTUS
THIS syndicate is formed to take over the unsold portion of the Fruit Vale Estate, the property of M. Theo. Kear-
ney, situated in Fresno County, California, and embracing 5187 acres, for the purpose of planting and develop-
ing the unplanted portion and selling the whole to another company, say two years hence, which will issue bonds
and shares to provide for its purchase. *
This property was carefully selected and purchased by Mr. Kearney in 1383, and is pronounced by all who
have seen it to be one of the most attractive and valuable country estates In California. The soil is of the class now
known to be of the greatest value for the production of choice raisins and of port, sherry and burgundy wines, of
which there remains in the Fresno district but a very limited quantity not already planted. It Is conceded that no
other county in the State can successfully compete with Fresno In these products.
Reference is made to an accompanying circular for reports upon the property. See pages 31 to 37.
Of the 5187 acres, 3000 have bfcen used as grain land, 1000 acres are in alfalfa, 900 acres in full bearing raisin
vineyard and 100 acres in bearing Orchard.
A palm avenue, the finest In the State, eleven miles long, with three roadways, beginning at the town of Fres-
no, runs through the property. .
A park in the center of the estate contains 240 acres and is handsomely improved. It is, however, reserved
from sale, as it is less profitable than the other lands, but It is to be leased by the syndicate so as to utilize the
buildings.
The whole property Is under a thorough system of Irrigation, with long established water rights belonging to It;
roads are constructed to every part, every twenty-acre sub-division having a frontage on a road â an Important ad-
vantage in the event that it is ever desired to sell the property in sub-divisions. Ample buildings for its needs are
already erected, and in all other respects the property is in first-class order, over $400,000 having been expended in its
improvement. With an additional expenditure of $400,000 it can in the next three years be brought to earn a net In-
come of from $50 to $150 per acre, or $250,000 to $750,000 annually, depending upon the seasons and market conditions.
This estimate is conservative. (See circular, pages 37 to 40.) â¢ .
On account of the depression in the raisin industry following the panic of 1893, largely due to Improper meth-
ods in marketing the crop in practice at that time, the raisin acreage of the State has been greatly reduced and as a
result the yearly demand for raisins !s now fully equal to the yearly supply. Further, the demand is rapidly In-
creasing owing to the introduction of machinery which is now successfully used to take the seeds from raisins be-
fore they are offered for sale. "Seeded" raisins are becoming a very popular article Of food with cooks and housa
keepers throughout the country. â¢ *
The California Raisin Growers* Association, which is In the third year of its successful career, fixes the price of
raisins for the whole crop of the State and assures prosperity to raisin growers. *
The California Wine Association offers to make a contract for ten years at a very remunerative figure for thÂ«
purchase of all wine grapes we may produce. " ,
It Is proposed to at once plant 4000 acres (of which 2000 acres are already being planted) In raisin and wins
vineyard and in new California Smyrna fig orchard. This can be done at an outlay, covering three years of $300 000
One hundred thousand dollars more is required to pay off a mortgage and $100,000 for equipment. * "
The 5187 acres and the personal property, including about 275,000 raisin curing trays and boxes of the value of
$30,000, 100 head of work animals, with harness, farming Implements, vehicles, 800 tons of hay 200 tons of barlpv an.1
about one million rooted vines for the coming season's planting, etc.. etc.. have been taken over by the syndicate at
the gross sum of $865,000, or the net sum, deducting the mortgage of $100,000. of $765,000. Thl3 is a very low valuation
as sales of wholly unimproved land In this tract of the same quality have been made at an average of $"00 per acre*
(See in circular the certificate of the searcher of records, page 34.) The crop of raisins, grapes and fruits gathered In
1900 and the outstanding accounts are not included In the purchase. All expenditures since October 1 1900 not on rrnn
account have been assumed by the syndicate; the amount, however, does not exceed $5000 No other 'liabilities are us
Burned except the mortgage for $100,000. * e
Of the purchase price Mr. Kearney has accepted $700,000 in fully paid shares, thus showing in the strongest man-
ner his faith in the investment. -, â ...

/This leaves $735,000 of treasury stock to be sold if further expenditures are found desirable. ' A 'by-law adopted
by the syndicate prohibits the incurment of any debts beyond the value of the treasury stock on hand thus guar-
anteeing in a very practical :way that the stock issued will not be assessed. â¢ Â«â¢*Â«â¢. Â«Â»"Â» sÂ«<"
It Is well known in the raisin district' that good vineyards earn $100 per acre annually under present conditions.
As bonds bearing 5 per cent interest which are secured on property earning two or three times the Interest payable
on the bonds are eagerly sought for It can safely be expected that when the time arrives to Issue bonds Ton thS prop-
erty it can readily^ be done on a baais of $500 per\acre because the fixed charge for interest will b" only $-5 per acre.
These bonds will be especially desirable because they will have valuable real estate as a basis of
â¢ At this rate of $500 per acre the bond Issue will be $2,500,000. thus returning to the syndicate the whole of their
capital and 100 per cent profit In addition to that $5,000,000 of shares will be issued to the syndicate Â¦and a? the^earn-
ings of the property above $25 per acre, which, after setting aside a percentage to the sinking fund f or the redenS-
tion of the bonds, should equal 6 per cent on $5,000,000, will -be paid In dividends to the shareholders!. reaemp

Arrest of Hypnotist Newman
Upon the Charge of
Special Dispatch to The CalL
OMAHA. Neb., Dec. 4.â Omaha haa a
genuine Bvengall in the city bastlle,
charged with having .wrecked the mind of
one of the prettiest girls In Omaha. 'His
name is James K. Newman, spiritualist
and hypnotist, and he has been a resident
of Omaha for about a year. He Is of Ger
man extraction, a slight, undersized man
with long raven locks, piercing black eyes
and prominent nose. He resembles the
stage character of Svengali to a remark
able degree. At the jail he disclaimed
any knowledge of th'e disappearance of
the young woman.
Nine months ago Miss Mary Ellen
Broderlck, who lived with her parents at
2520 Chicago street, was hypnotized at a
spiritual seance, and since then she has
been of unsound mind. Thanksgiving
morning she attended services at St.
John's Church. This was the last her
family has seen of her.
The matter was brought to the atten
tion of the police and to-day "James New
man, who is alleged to have exerted the
mental influence over the girl, was lodged
in Jail.
Miss Brodcrick Is a comely girl of 23.
She Is petite of figure, has brown hair,
blue eyes and plump, rosy cheeks which
harmonize but little with her fatalistic
temperament and proneness to study the
occult. In spite of the warnings of her
father Miss Broderlck during last winter
went as often as two or three times a
week to the eptritual seances. At first It
was merely as a spectator, but soon the
so-called materializations began to have
a wonderful fascination for her. James
K. Newman played the role of hypnotist,
and It is said that he found the girl so
susceptible to his machinations that a few
passes of the hand and a moment's steady
gaze of hla black eyes sufficed to bring
on unconsciousness.

Civil Service Commission yesterday in
tho matter of certain appointments and
he came out second best in the encoun
ter. .
Scott was permitted by the Super-visors
to retain ten clerks out of the forty-nvo
extra ones allowed him to assist In tho
collection of taxes. Ho appeared before
the commission and stated that he would
retain Frank Rettegstern, Â»W. I. RIley,
George Miller, F. Foley, James Twohig,
H. L. Maguire, H. Larsen, S. H. Brown,
P. W. Jonea and E. W. BIgelow. The
commission, however, took the stand that
these ten men were not at the head of the
eligible list and they would have to be
discharged to make way for those that
were.
Scott claimed that his selections were
the best for practical work, but the com
mission said It would not allow the city
to pay their salaries. The men volun
teered to do work for nothing, but Scott
says he may pay them out of hla own
pocket In order to retain their services.
TAX COLLECTOR MAY
PAY HIS EXTRA CLERKS
Civil Service Board Declines to Allow
Scott to Retain Those of His
Own Selection.
Tax Collector Scott went up ajralnst the
the one as by the other. The court de
cided that the employe while thus tem
porarily employed in breaking out the
stone understood the risk he was Incur
ring, and therefore his employer was not
liable for the accident.
A Michigan Case.
An interesting case has been tried In
Michigan. Some employes made hcatora
and gaa machines, and in their factory
was a carpenter's shop, containing among
other things two small circular saws. Tna
injured employe was only a general la
borer. He was, however, instructed in
the uso of the saws by one of the car
penters, and was Informed of the danger
in using them. He was set to work oc
casionally at the saws, but always pro
tested, "the grounds of his protest being
sometimes that he Â¦was not employed lor
that work, and at other times that ha
was afraid of the saw." Finally he was
injured when using one of the saw9 and
sued his employer. Tho Supreme Court
In dealing with his claim said he was
thoroughly Instructed by the employer's
agent in the use of the Baw: that "what
ever danger there was was apparent: that
he had full and complete knowledge of
all the risks; that he was strong in body
and mind and in full possession of all his
faculties, and that he had frequently done
this work for a year and waa familiar
with It. He knew that he was liable to
be called upon to do it. Even If it werw
without the scope of his employment, he
could not by his protest cast all tho risk
of accident upon his employer. An em
ploye under <?uch circumstances has his
choice either to leave the employment or
to remain and assume all the risks Inci
dent to the work he knows that he is ex
pected to do."
Lack of Authority Thus to Employ
a Man Is No Defense.
Another case has arisen In Michigan In
which an ingerlous defense was made
worthy of notice. A man was employed
as a common laborer by a railroad com
pany, and afterward was required to act
as a brakeman â¢without any increase of
pay. Having been injured, he sued the
company, which tried to shield It3elf be
hind the defense that the superintendent
who thus changed the employe'* work
had no authority to do so. and conse
quently he need not have obeyed him.
By doing otherwise and obeying him it
was contended that he wa$ acting in a
voluntary manner. He was. therefore,
negligent In thus acting without author
ity, and so, of course, had no claim
against the company. The court remark
ed that generally It was no excuse to an
employer" that an injury was caused by
disobedience of his orders. "Ho assumes
the risk of such disobedience when ho
puts the servant Into his business." In
other words, if an employer Instructs his
agent to hire only highly competent men.
to do a piece of work and he employs
incompetent ones, whereby other em
ployes are in lured, the employer cannot
defend himself by saying: "I supposed I
was employing a faithful and proper
agent. I am very sorry, but I pught not
to be held liable; ho alone is to blame."
The law In such matters makes the
agent's act his employer's act. and he iÂ»
as much responsible for the selection of.
incompetent employes as though he had
selected them himself.
Effect of an Agreement to Obey All
Orders.
This defense was attempted In a casa
tried In Rhode Island. A fireman who wa3
tending an engine fire was asked by tho
engineer to assist him in throwing on a
belt that worked a putnp which waa U3Od
to fill the boiler. The fireman complied,
but was injured while thu9 acting. The
court decided that he had a good claim
against the company; for In attempting to
assist the engineer he was acting outsido
of his regular duty and subjecting himsolf
to a new risk, and especially one with
which he was not acquainted. Further
more, the company was not permitted to
shield Itself behind the engineer's lack of
authority to give such an order to thÂ»
fireman. He "must be looked upon,
said the court, "as representing his em
ployer."
Suppose an employÂ© signs an agreement
to obey all orders, rulea and regulations,
and enters the service of a. railroad com
pany as a brakeman, for example, has tho
company a light in such a case to put him
.at some other employment temporarily?
The Supreme Court of Michigan has
answered this question, holding that tho
contract means all orders, etc.. issued to
persons in the same class of employment,
and does not Justify the company In
transferring an employe from one class
to another. If, therefore, he Is assigned,
to some other -work which ho has never
agreed to do. and Injured while perform
ing it, he has a claim against his com
pany.
Unknown Bisk.
The cases all clearly follow tho rulo
that If one Is employed for a specific kind
of work and is temporarily set at another
task involving greater risks that are un
known or not understood tho employer ia
liable for the consequences. Cases of
this kind, too. often occur among minors,
and one such has come before the Su
preme Court of the United States. A boy
was employed in a machine shop as a
helper under tho direction of C. His du
ties were chiefly in receiving and putting
away moldings as they came from tho
machine. One day C ordered him to as
cend a ladder at great height among dan
gerous machinery and adjust a belt. While
doing so his arm was torn from his body.
The court decided that the order was not
a reasonable one and the owners of the
shop were held, liable.

JUST the drlbblings of scandal are
leaking through the mesh of the
law invoked to prevent proof being
offered In support of Drury
Melone's allegations contained in
his cross-complaint in the action, insti
tuted against him by ex-Judge William
T. Wallace and Ryland B. Wallace. Pub
lic policy has intervened and stripped the
action of Its most Interesting elementâ
the charge made by Meione that his ser
vices on behalf of Wallace in the manipu
lation of State legislation and some others
were reasonably worth more than Wal
lace claims for legal services rendered at
the instance and request of the defendant.
Judge Seawell during the hearing of the
cane yesterday held, in accordance with
fixed precedents, that the corrupt use of
funds to maintain a lobby ror the purpose
of influencing legislation Is against pub
lic policy and none may successfully set
up such expenditure of funds In defense
when fighting an action Instituted in good
faith and on lawful gTound for tho re
covery of money or property. This ruling
eliminated from the case those items in
Melone's bill of particulars referring to
services rendered In seeking to force legis
lation to facilitate the collection of the
Placerville bonds.
Before opposing counsel could wedge in
an objection, however, Meione frequently
shoved a word or two Into the record re
garding Judge Wallace's connection with
the frequent pilgrimages to the halls of
the Senate and Assembly. James Q. Ma
guire, who represents Meione. also took
occasion during hi* opening etatement on
behalf of the defense to boost "the ugly
head of scandal" a little higher and bet
ter into the public gaze. He passed rapid
ly over many items contained In his
client's cross-complaint, but Bpoke delib
erately and Impressively when he reached
that charge of $1000 which Meione claims
is due him for settling an account be
tween Judge Wallace and John F. Mc-
Cauley.
"We will try to show," said Judge Ma
guire, "that this allegation of the settle
ment by Wallace with McCauley by the
payment of J5000 after a transaction in
volving the changing of hands of $10,000.
In which the name of Lloyd Tevis is
prominently mentioned, was not, as Mr.
Pillsbury said in hi* opening statement,
â¢incorporated in the eult for the purpose
of Intimidating Judge Wallace.' We will
try to show that McCauley had become
loud and boisterous In his assertions of
that claim to the detriment of Wallace.

GENTLEMEirS SODAUETY
IN "COMEDY OF EEROBS"
"Answers to these questions would bring
us back to the same Illicit use of money
to influence legislators," said Mr. Camp
bell. "These men who, it is alleged, lived
in Sacramento at Melone's expense in the
Interest of Judge Wallace are notorious
agents of potent factors In politics. For
these reasons we object to the question."
Judge Maguire attempted to explain
that be was woll aware of that rule of
law which would prevent him from recov
ering on a claim for such services, but
he contended that the rule was different
when matters of this kind were set up In
defense to a claim against tho defendant.
Judge Seawoll, however, stood by his orig
inal ruling and the Legislature end of the
case was swept aside.
thÂ« witness said that after
the defeat of the first bill in tho Legis
lature of 1881 Judge Wallace wrote an
other bill, but as this dragged Judge Wal
lace prepared a memorial in which Meyers
appealed to the sense of Justice of the
Legislature to come to his aid and force
the "defaulting city of Placerville" to
meet its obligations. Another pamphlet
was prepared warning the public against
the dangers of Investing in public securi
ties, and this paper also found its way
into the hands of the legislators.
Finally Meione was permitted to an
swer as a preliminary question whether
or not he had paid W. T. HIgglns $5000
for his influence. He answered in the af
firmative, as he did to a similar question
regarding the payment of $4000 to Carr.
When asked if these payments were made
in the presence of Wallace an objection
was raised and sustained, and on motion
of opposing counsel the answers to the
preliminary questions were ordered strick
en out. Hence the record remained clear
of the Legislature end of the case though
an Impression doubtless remained on the
minds of the jurors.
The witness, after a recital of Judge
Wallace's efforts to secure needed legis
lation, said that he met Judge Wallace
and he had commiserated with the witness
on his loss of time and money. "And
finally," said Meione, "he said that he
would surrender all claim he had to the
bonds in my favor and concluded with
the assertion that even If he did secure
the needed legislation it would be use
less, 'for," said Judge Wallace, 'that in
famous Supreme Court would declare It
unconstitutional, just because I was In
the case.' " -*
Meione proceeded on this line until he
had completed his explanation of how he
finally secured a compromise and collected
on the bonds. During his examination he
frequently Indulged in reminiscences, and
once he caused a ripple of excitement by
exclaiming: "Judge Wallace and I were
always friendly until this difficulty. One
day he asked me to be his executor, or
at least told me that he believed he would
name me as such In his will as a recogni
tion for all the services I had done him.
He told me he was going to give all his
money to his daughter, for his eons were
indolent and undeserving. His son, Ry
land, was then In Europe, and I asked
him when he would return. He' said he
didn't know and didn't care." Â¦
When Meione proceeded on this line
Wallace leaned far out of his chair to
better catch tho words of the witness.
An expression was on his face that bodes
a warm cross-examination for Meione this
morning and warmer developments still
when the aged Jurist mounts the stand
In rebuttal.
Judge Maprulre's question as to Melone's
expenses raised the point of "public pol
icy," and here the end came to what was
to have been the sensational feature of
the case. Mr. Campbell, representing
Judsre Wallace, objected to the question
on the ground that it involved the proof
of matters void in law, being against pub
lic policy. In rapid succession. In order to
save the point for action on appeal. Judge
Maguire asked the witness regarding the
items In his bill of particulars! for ex
penses of William B. Carr. William T.
Higgins and Colonel GIllls, "for their In
fluence In securing legislation to facilitate
the collection of the Placerville bonds."
Maguire closed his opening statement
and Meione was called to the stand. Like
Judge "Wallace, he was in a reminiscent
mood and counsel experienced some diffi
culty in preventing him from drifting
fiway from direct answers into collateral
matters and once or twice into Judge
Wallace's family affairs. After generally
covering the ground of his association
with Judge Wallace in connection with
the Placerville bond matters Meione flatly
contradicted Judge Wallace's statement
to the effect that no written agreement
was in existence fixing how the profits
would be shared when victory crowned
their efforts. Meione said there was a
written agreement and asserted that the
came was drawn up by Mr. Hastings
when he was In partnership with Ryland
B. Wallace. Continuing, he said:
"Judge Wallace prepared two bills to
b* introduced Into the Legislature. He
nr.d I agreed to go to Sacramento and
take Mr. Meyers, who was then a poor
man and who held a block of the bonds,
with us. Within three days the bill was
prepared and Introduced. The work was
arduous, an there were several intellec
tual giants In the Legislature at that
tlma Judge Wallace remained during
the entire pesslon and appeared before
the committees to which the bills had
been referred."
"It was stated by Mr. Pillsbury in h!s
opening statement that McCauley's state
ments were the statements of a dis
gruntled or defeated litigant, who was
complaining of a court which had decid
ed against him. Such was not the case.
McCauley's complaint was about a matter
In which he had succeeded and In which
a large fortune had been awarded to him
by a decision of the court in the very mat
ter about which McCauley was making
these harsh and injurious statements."
sensational parade of this charge by Mc-
Cauley, Mr. Meione, through LJoyd Tovls,
was called upon to meet Meione, he
(Melone) having been In early days a
close friend of McCaulev, they having
traveled across the plains together, and
was asked by Wallace to settle with Me-
Cauley upon the best terms he could ar
range. Meione undertook the effort. Mc-
Cauley demanded $10,000 by way of set
tlement. An arrangement was finally
made by which McCauley was to be paid
45000. Settlement was to be made and
was made through the agency of Mr. Me
ione and for that service Meione charges
$1000 and Wallace agreed to pay him that
amount or to allow the same on the settle
ment of the Placerville bond cases.

Not infrequently an employe Is asked to
undertake a piece of work that is outside
his regular employment and Involving
more risk. Sometimes he has .been In
jured while thus employed and has sought
to recover something, in the way of dam
ages from his employer. Can he get any
thing if he appeals to the law?
Usually He Assumes the Risk.
It is said in such cases, if he under
takes the new employment knowing that
it la more' risky, even though he is to re
ceive no larger compensation, he assumes
the risk. This question has been fully
considered by the Supreme Court of Mas
sachusetts in a case against the Boston
and Albany Railroad. The person injured
was aiding as* fireman on an engine, and
knew that he was not required to do so
by his original contract with the com
pa"hy. He was asked to serve In this way
and he complied rather than run the risk
of losing his position as a laborer. In so
doing the court said he assumed the nec
essary risk. He did this, continued the
court, "rather than lose the position
which he held and which he desired to
retain," and by so doing added this duty
to the one he first agreed to perform.
"Morally to coerce a servant to an em
ployment the risk of which he does not
wish to encounter, by threatening other
wise to deprive him of an employment he
can readily and safely perform may
sometimes be harsh; but when one has
assumed an employment, if an additional
and more dangerous duty is added to his
original labor, he may accept or refuse
it." if he should refuse, and as a conse
quence be discharged, he can sue his em
ployer for breaking his original contract
with him. This is the remedy that the
law provides for him. But as his term of
service usually is very short, and his em
ployer can discharge him fn most cases
when it is for his interest to do ao, this
remedy ia not worth much. He has in
truth in many cases no alternative but
to perform the new service. The court, in
the case above mentioned, says that if
the laborer has no contract for a specific
period and "knowingly, although unwill
ingly, accepts the additional and more
dangerous employment, he accepts Us in
cidental risks, and cannot recover for an
injury which occurs only from his own
inexperience. The employer is not neces
sarily unjust because he wishes in his
employ a servant who can from time to
time relieve a skillful workman while his
ordinary duties will be those of a mere
laborer."
The Eule in Wisconsin.
In 'Wisconsin the rule Is somewhat qual
ified. The Supreme Court of that State
holds that when an employe of mature
years and of ordinary intelligence and ex
perience is directed to do. temporary work
and consents to do it without objection,
he assumes the risk. This rule was ap
plied in the following case: The foreman
of a gang of men who were building
bridges for a railroad directed them to
take an engine and do some switching.
They readily obeyed, but while one of
them was trying to couple a car he was
injured. He tried to recover for. the in-
Jury, but failed to get anything. .
In a case that happened in a sawmill in
Michigan the injured employe claimed
that -he had not been employed to do the
work In which he was engaged at the
time he was injured; that he had no ex
perience In doing it and lacked the skill
and strength required to do It; that he
did not know of the danger and was not
warned against It. Furthermore. he
claimed that his employer did know of
the danger and was negligent In not tell
ing him. The evidence, however, did not
sustain his claim. He had been employed
around the mill several years and bad
been "put on ail kinds of machinery to
run." The machine whereby he was in
jured was a good one and in good order
and was not dangerous to use. Indeed,
the evidence showed that it was one of
the simplest of the employer's machines
and was not infrequently operated with
out difficulty by unskilled workmen "an.1
sometimes by beginners." He therefore
failed for several reasons to prove his
case, one of the most important of which
was that his risk was not Increased from
running the machine by which he was in
jured.
When Employers Have Been Held
Liable.
There are cases, though, in which an em
ployer has been held liable for putting
his employes to other tasks than thos-3
first undertakenâ cases in which the dan
ger was greater and not known or under
stood by the employe. One of these cases
was Lalors against the Chicago and Bur
lington Railroad, which was tried in Illin
ois. The injured employe was employed
around the frelghthouso of tl e company
as a common laborer to load and unload
freight and for no. other purpose. While
thus engaged he was ordered by a fore
man of the company to couple cars. He
was totally Ignorant of this business an1
the foreman knew it. Having been killed
while thus engaged through thÂ« negil
gence of the engineer of the train with
which he was acting his widow sued the
company. The court remarked that in
agreeing to work for the company he
might be presumed to have known tho
perils usually and necessarily Incident to
the services. But he engaged to per
form work only ordinarily hazardous. On
the other hand, he was compelled to do
other work that was extra hazardous, by
which he lost his life. The superintendent
knew at the time he set him at coupling
cars that he was unskilled in the work
and the' company in law was present by
and through this officer "It was. then,
by the direct command of the company
the deceased was exposed to this peril
and one out of the line of the business he
had contracted to perform. He was killed
by the negligence of the driver in charge
of the locomotive while thus exposed. The
law would bo lamentably deficient did it
, furnish no remedy In such a case."
The "Wrong Consists in Not Telling
Him of His Greater Danger.
The company was held liable In this
case because It set one of Its servants at a
different employment, without agreement,
that was more hazardous, -without telling
him and of which he had no proper
knowledge. The essence of its wrong
was not so much In changing his employ
ment as In increasing the risk without in
forming him. If he had known how to
couple cars as well as he knew how to
handle freight a different question would
have been presented. Thus Judge Jenkins
in a Federal case remarks: "The master
may not lawfully expose his servant to
greater risks than those pertaining to the
particular service for which he has en
gaged and against which the servant,
through want of skill or by reason of ten
der age or physical inability, could not
presumably defend himself If unapprised
of the danger. . He is bound to warn the
servant of the danger. If It bÂ« not ob
vious, and to Instruct him how It may be
avoided." The court then proceeds ,to
add that If the servant be of mature
years and have ordinary knowledge and
experience he is presumed to understand
all obvious dangers. . In such a case,
therefore, his master is not liable to him
if he does "dangerous work without tho
scope of his engagement for service mere
ly because he has been directed by the
master to perform such work."
The Rule Applied to a Quarryman.
Yin the case in which this principle was
applied the Injured employe was employ
ed in a quarry to prepare stone for new-
Ing. He had been doing such work for
more than two years and understood how
to "channel" stone and turn over cuts of
sto'ne after channeling. He also knew
that there were often seams In tho rock
which weakened it and rendered it liable
to break when men were at work. The
foreman of the quarry directed this em
ploye to leave his regular work, which
was free from risk, and assist In breaking
out a cut of stone by using wedges. Not
Fiicceeding, ; the foreman told him to go
below and clear the way for using the
steam drill. While he was doing as he
was bidden the foreman continued to use
the wedges to break out the stone, and
while he was doing this a piece of seamy
stone spilt off and injured the employe.
.Th'e seam was covered over with stone
dust and mud and aÂ» diffi*uÂ«it x. o see t-,,.

"Conditions have been generally favorable
for maturing oranpes in Southern California,
thoujrh in some sections the cocl. cloudy weath
er ha* retarded their development to some ex
tent. Large quantities cf oranges and olive*
are being gathered in all citrus fruit districts."
' 'Fivorable weather has prevailed In all sec
tions during the week. I_pht ehowers have
fallen in portion* cf the central and northern
eectlcn, end part of the week has been cloudy
or foggy, with lower temperatures and fre
quent light frosts In many places. There has
been sufficient sunuhlne. accompanied by fa
vorable winds, to dry out the soil to some ex
tent, enabling tarmers to continue the work
of plowing and seeding, except on the low
lands, which are Btill too wet ior cultivation.
li any serious damage was done to growing
crops or fruit treee by the recent storm, re
ports have not been received at thie office. '
On the contrary. In one cf the sections cf
Â£?uthern California where it was reported that
oranpe groves had been flooded and nearly
ruined, a correspondent now states that practi
c_.!iy no damage was done, and that this eea.
e.on'6 orange crop will be fully equal to last
season's. All parts of the State have been im
mensely beneuted by the heary rains of the
preceding two weeks, and agriculturists are
Â«eeming:y confident that the present season
wiil be the best for many y^ans. An lncrea*Â»ed
acreage of grain in all the grain-growing dis
tricts is one of the reeults of the favorable
conditions up to this date, and correspondents
state that the early sown grain is making re
1r.ark2.bJe growth and is of excellent color and
etrength. Grass has aJeo grown rapidly and
green feed is* abundant in all sections. Alfalfa
Is thrifty and will yield a heavy crop.

CHICAGO, Dee. 4.â Wheat found a firm and
somewhat broader market save for a degree of
easiness at the opening on Â¦ unresponsive Liver
pool cables. January opened Ha lower at 7OT4o
to 70%c. On buying by St. Louis Interests the
market steadied. A Rosario cable announcing
damage to the Argentine crop by hail also
figured in holding the market. Later the corn
strength, the belief that Bradstreet's world's
visible would show a decrease of 3.000.000 bush
els and the reported closing. of navigation on
the sea of* Azof caused a sharp demand
Shorts covered freely on the advance and Jan
uary rose to 71Â«4e. Against the price were lib
eral Northwestern receipts, a continuation of
the heavy Southwestern movement and the lack
of cash demand, but In spite of these facts the
market held strong and January closed Â«e un
at 71>ig71%c. p
December corn waa the feature Jn the corn
pit. Rumors of a probable squeeze similar tn
that worked by Phillips wai rife. Contrail
etocks here are only 1.SOO.O0O bushels and nearly
all of this, It is stated, has found an Eastern
market. I Receipts show about 1 per cent of
contract grade. Phillips was credited with tak
Ing In 600,000 bushels Â« December during the
day. There Is little old corn In the country
the leaders say, and the roads make it dlffl
cut to get that to market. Unfavorable weath
er and strength of foreign markets were fac
tors in the market. December sold -between
2L and , 3 . 7 ' 4C , and Close<i * c over 7Â«tertiTlt
86J4c May closed H^lc higher at S6?4c.

disbursement of 2 per cent. The speculation
haE gone on right merrily on that basis. The
price was run up to 1S5U this morning when
the Intimation was disseminated that no ac
tion would be taken en the dividend to-day.
Consequently the announcement a little later
that the directors had met at the private resi
dence of thff president of the company and
declared a dividend of only 1\ per cent came j
like a bombshell upon the speculative con- j
tlngent. In their rush to save losses they
forced the price down by rapid 6toÂ«jes, meet
ing no eupport except from profesnioniU shorts
on the way down. Tha stock touched 127^4 in
the last hour, which was 8 full points below
the highest and closed with a net loss of ('-,Â».
The violent slump In this stock had a depress
ing inCuence on the whole market, but the
movement elsewhere at no time approached
' demoralization. In fact there were points of
strength persisting here and there in the rail
road list, but they yielded their Â»alns in the
late reaction. The pressure to sell the rail
roads grew steadily during the latter part of
the d&y end a large number of them ehow
net losses of about a point. Chicago. Bur
lington and Quincy declined 1%. The general
weakness, while partly due to sympathy with
the violent decline in Sugar, was undoubtedly
based for the most part on anxiety as to the
ability of the money market to carry specu
lative accounts ea-feiy over the new year. There
Â¦was no evidence that liquidation was forced
to-iay, but a spirit of caution prevailed* and
Induced measures to avoid anything like forced
liquidation In view of the large advances in
prices which the market has enjoyed. Another
noticeable feature of the situation is the stead
iness of sterling exchange in spHe of the flrm
nÂ«s of the local money market and the notably
ea* ier rates la London and Berlin. The for
, eign Belling of our securities, which was con
1 tinued to-day to the Â«>xt*nt of 25,000 chares,
is supposed to account for this. The opinion
Is expressed by borne foreign authorities that
this process has been carried so far as to leave
New Tork without future power to draw gold
from European sources. In this connection to-,
day's report of a further shipment from Aus
tralia to San Francisco of 11.500,000 in gold has
some Fipniflcance. , Incoming Bt^amers are
bringing large shipments of American secur
ities recently sold by foreign holders, and the
Increase In the supply of stock available for
lending s-rves to. facilitate bear operations in j
tbe market. \
The bond market shared In the reactionary
tendency of the stock market, but was varied
by r.ew points of strength. Total sales, par

quite a difference In the amount of sales. The
tone of the market Is steady, but the anxiety
felt regarding the recent failure of two wool
housee-on account of. a fear that tha wools
held by these dealers would be forced on the
market has been allayed by the fact that ths
wools are to be offered on the market the same
as before. Dealers are viewing the outlook
with expectation of a better market, but as
yet they can see but little prospect of imme

New York Money Market.
London was dull throughout except for Eries,
In which an apparently concerted movement
was made, both here and In New York. London
was Inclined to sell the list, but New York
steadied prices, sending Erie firsts a dollar
above London prices.
Business In the markets here to-day was re
stricted and dull, speculators refraining from
dealing until Thursday's Afrikander meeting,
which, it is thought, may create some political
disquietude. Paris rumors of a settlement of
copper troubles were accompanied by a fall in
Tintos of 1H and in Spanish fours of % and
fairly large cash sales of consols which fell
3-16. The sales of Tintos were attributed to
President McKlnley's reference to trusts In his
message,, which, hitting the Amalgamated
Company wouta, it was thought, react on
Tintos, but the trouble is apparently local.

NKW YORK. Dec. 4.â A special to the
Journal from London says: The invasion
of England by American capital is caus
ing an awakening in financial circles. So
long as the Americans came to England
with good things to sell and sought Brit
ish capital for American Investments lit
tle notice was taken, Dut the latest de
velopment of Americans finding good
things in England, putting their own
money into them and not letting English
men share in the profits, puts another
face of the situation. -
This, combined with the invasion of
American goods and the capture of many
valuable contracts, has roused many
financial men to the necessity of doing
something to protect home investments.
The anti-American business campaign
will be quietly conducted with no publi
cation, no names; simply a secret check
mating whenever possible.
There Has Been an Awaken
ing in Financial Circles

INVASION OF
AMERICAN GOODS
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.â The Woman's
Christian Temperance Union Convention
to-day adopted resolutions against the
array canteen and prepared a petition to
the President and another to Congress
and to all of the great powers against the
eale of firearms and the importation of
liquor and opium into the Philippines or
the island possessions of the other powers
addressed.
The petition to the President pointed out
that it has been the policy of America to
forbid the sale of Intoxicants to the Indian
tribes, and that England, who had the
greatest experience among all of the col
onizing powers of the world, had been
forced to adopt a prohibition policy in her
colcnles in Africa and elsewhere. The
convention, therefore, asks that the Presi
dent, either through the War Department
<r 'the Philippine. Commission, shall ex
tend the prohibition law of the Indian
Territory eo as to take in the Philippine
Islands.
A petition to the Senate urges the rati
fication of the pending treaty for the pro
tection of Central Africa against intoxi
cants.
A petition also was drawn up to Great
Britain, France, Spain, Holland. Belgium,
Sweden, Norway. Denmark. Hungary,
Greece, Russia. Turkey, Persia and Japan,
asking for an International 'treaty that
will forbid the sale of Intoxicants, opium
end firearms in all islands and other re
gions inhabited chiefly by aboriginal
tribe?.
The afternoon reports of the superin
tendents were received and a white satin
banner was presented to Mrs. A. B. Leek
of Indianapolis for securing the largest
number of members.
To-night was "Y" night and Mrs. Clara

TELEPHONE AND FIRE
ALARM WIHES CUT
VANCOUVER. Dec. 4. â The Sunset
Telephone Company of San Francisco,
owners of the business of the Inland Tele
phone Company of Spokane, Wash., has
come out victorious in the light that has
been carried on for a year and a half
between the Inland Company and its
British Columbia rival, the Vernon & Nel
son Company. The Burrard Inlet* Com
pany of Vancouver to-day refused to buy
m the business of the Vernon & Nelson
at 50 cents on the dollar.
The British Columbia Company has
been operated for several months by the
Bank of Halifax, which took the system
lor a bank debt of $150,000. More than 300
miles of main wire and lines to dozens of
small mining camps have been paralleled
by the. provincial company, on ground cov
ered by the Spokane organization. Many
of the business houses through Kootenay
were compelled to patronize both services,
but three months ago the American com
pany, got the upper hand and to-day the
Vernon & Nelson, is being negotiated at
less than half its- value. The cost of the
system was more than $200,000.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 4.â The cable of
the Sunset Telegraph and Telephone Com
pany, containing practically all the long
distance lines out of Los Angeles, was

o'clock last night, entirely Interrupting
telephone connection with San 'Francisco
and all points north and east. The police
and lire alarm wires were cut at the same
point, and until the damage was repaired
early this morning East Los Angeles was
deprived of fire and police protection. The
mischief was done at the corner of Eight
eenth and Pasadena avenues.
This afternoon several wires were cut at
the corner of Second street and Beaudry
avenue. The telephone company has of
fered a reward of $250, and the police are
actively engaged upon the case.

OAKLAND, Dec. 4.â Miss Malinda
Porter, colored, did not batter
and assault her attorney, Wash
ington Jackson Oglesby, also
cole-red. She only shook -he"? fist
at him, then shook a cane at him, and
then put her revolver on the front parlor
table as a matter of general protection
and ornament. This is official, for a jury
determined these points in the Police
Court to-day.
The whole thing was a study in color
at which Police Judge Smith was the
committee of awards and a jury of eleven
men the committee upon decision. The
committee of decision found the foregoing
facts and the committee upon awards
awarded Miss Malinda Porter her liberty.
Judge Smith started out to secure a
Jury entirely of colored men, but both
Washington Jackson Oglesby and Miss
Malinda Porter are widely and favorably
known in colored society, and it was
found very difficult to secure g-entlemen
of their race who felt unbiased enough
to sit in judgment in a quarrel between
them. So Judge Smith v?as forced to fill
the box with whites, and then he could
only get eleven jurors. Washington Jack-
son Oglesby ably assisted the prosecution.
Mi3s Porter was acquitted.
Miss Malinda Porter occupies a house
that Is owned by the Hibernia Savings
and Loan Association, and one day when
Fhe stepped out upon the back porch it
pave way with her, and she was badly
bruised. Washington Jackson Oglesby
was consulted. Miss Porter says that he
volunteered his services, and Mr. Oglesby
says that he was consulted as an at
torney. He wrote a letter to the bank as
an attorney, he says, and Miss Porter
6ays that he changed letters on her and
sent a different one from that authorized
by her. However, the bank settled, and
Miss Porter is eminently satisfied.
Then Washington Jackson Oglesby
called to get his fee. Mr. Oglesby says
that he got it in the shape of sundry
blows in the face and a broken cane over
his head, and that then .Missj Porter
picked up a revolver and drove him out
of the house. Miss Porter said that the
attorney-at-law threatened her and then
she waved her cane at him, and pointed
to a revolver on the front parlor table,
where it lay as a bit of bric-a-brac.
The Jury voted nine to two for acquittal
on the first ballot and- then unanimously
for the lady.

NKW YQttK, Dec. 4.â John Armstrong
Chanler, great-grandson of the first John
Jacob Astor and former husband of Ame
lie Rives, pix days ago escaped frcm
Blocmlngdale Asylum, and although de
tectives and hospital 'attendants have
searched the Westclioster woods and this
flty no trice of him has been found.
While Amelie Rives, who is now the
Pripcess Troubetskoy, lived In luxury,
surrounded by attendants, at Castle Hill,
near Charlottfsvllle, Va., Mr. Chanler. her
first husband, with his brilliant mind shat
tered, has been au inmate of the Bloom
lnj?<l:Ui? Asylum for the hopeleesly insane.
Friends sent him there in'.' February,
JJM7, and for nearly four years he had oc
cifpled comfortable quarters in what is
known as the MoCy cottage. He had had
the freedom of the srounds for the last
two years and his condition, while giving
no hope of ultimate recovery, â¢ had im
proved to such an extent that he was
trusted to take long walks without an at
tendant. On one of these last Friday
he went to the White Plains Railway
and boarded a train of the New York and
Harlem River Railroad bound for this
city. When he failed to return to the
asylum in the evening attendants were
sent In search of him.
They traced him to "White Plains sta
tion, but it was not positively known un
til Saturday that he had come to this
city. Dr. Samuel P. Ijyon, superintendent
of the institAtion^ then received a letter
from Mr. Chanlefi postmarked New York
City, saying vaguely that he was away
attending to some private business and
would return when it was transacted.
The letter was not written on hotel pa
per and bore no addres-s.
Mr. Chanler and Amelie Rives were
married at the height of her popularity,
won by writing "The Quick or the Dead!"
After their marriage they went abroad
and remained for some time. Rumors of
disagreements reached this country and in
October, 1893. a divorce was granted on
the ground of incompatibility of tempera
ment. Mr. Chauler was in broken health
and his wi.fe's second marriage is said to
have preyed on his mind to such an ex
tent that it- was necessary to have him
committed to Bloomingdale.
Mr. Chanler's chief delusion is said to
be tnat he Is a great personage and that
other great men are jealous of him and
are conspiring to kill him. One of his hal
lucinations for a time was that ho was
a sort of Dr. Jekyll nnd Mr. Hyde. He
has an Income of about $30,000 a year, and
is 40 years old.

Purchase of Sugars.
At a well-attended meeting of the
wholesale Grocers' Association of New
iork and vicinityâ an association which
comprises the leading grocery jobbers in
this section of the country â it was decided
Ul throw off all restraints in regard to the
purchase and eale of refined sugars.
President G. Waldo Smith of the associa
tion said after the meeting that no tleiin
ite action had been taken in the way ol
pecuriiiff a readjustment of the sugar
business and an adjournment had been
taken without datc% The entire matter
had been left in the hands of the execu
tive committee to recommend proper ac
tion. In Uie meantime, the members of
the association would purchase from th-j
rotincrs offering sugar at the lowest
prices and would peil at puch prices as
they considered for the best interests of
their busiii<--c : s. The action of the local
wholesale grocers is important for the
reason that New York has been one of
the sections which has most steadfastly
j'laintairie.i the price of sugar. Their posi
tion as regards the factor plan is shown
l>y the last annual address of President
Smith, in which he advocated action in
the direction of securing the restoration
<;! the factor plan by the sugar refiners
and the restoration also of the affidavit
s-ystem, with a rebate of 20 cents per 100
pounds and the trade discount of 1 per
cent lie a!?o advocated the adoption of
the factor plan by all manufacturers

No sooner had he entered the dining-room
than he caught sight of the pile of silver
ware on the table. Half an hour before
he had seen Mrs. Gustafson put this ware
carefully away In Its accustomed place on
a large sideboard. Then Gustafson was
satisfied that some one had entered the
place. While he was deciding upon a plan
of campaign, he observed a pair of shoes
behind a door leading Into a hallway.
Surmising then that there was a burglar
around, he started to pick up the shoes,
thinking the thief had left them .behind
In his flight. But the shoes did not yield,
and Gustafson discovered that they were
on a man's feet. He Jumped quickly for
the prostrate form and with poker up
lifted was about to strike, when the hid

The burglar feigned Intoxication, but
his actions belied his protestations that
he intended no harm. Gustafson held his
prisoner until the police, summoned by

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1900.
Seizes Thief in His House and Turns
Him Over to Police.
ARMED WITH A POKER
HE CAPTURES BURGLAR
OAKLAND, Dec. 4.â Armed only
with a light stove poker, Chris
Gustafson, superintendent of the
Oakland, San Leandro and Hay
wards electric road, captured a
bold burglar at his residence, 1169 Twenty
third avenue, last night, held the Intruder
and "turned him over to the police. The
prowler gave his name as Hugh McGov
ern, a laborer.
Oustafson and his wife had finished sup
per and were seated in the parlor of their
flat about H o'clock last evening, when
the superintendent's wife was attracted
by the sound of a creaking door knob. She
whispered to her husband that the door
leading: from the parlor to the dining
room had been disturbed. For a minute
they gave no thought to the occurrence,
but Oustafson was uneasy and he decided
to investigate.
With the poker he took from the fire
place the streetcar man started forth.

HOTEL ARRIVAL.
States forces In China. General Breckin
ridge also notes that the grade of briga
dier general is abolished In most of the
European armies and is nearly as archaic
as that of commodore afloat.
In regard to the question of the reor
ganization of the standing- army the gen
eral suggests a standard of two soldiers
per 1000 of population and submits statis
tics to show that in the proportion of sol
diers to population, and to the area of
country, and in the war budget in time of
peace, the United States Is far. behind all
of the great European nations.' \ .
General Breckinridge claims for his de
partment the credit of the discovery of
postal frauds in Cuba. He makes recom
mendation for additional clerical and mes
senger assistance in his department, and
also earnestly suggests that the War De
partment provide the various military
colleges throughout the country with cap
able and efficient military instructors.
Inspector General J. C. Breckinridge
Presents His Annual Report
->â¢*-/-. to the War Secretary.
WASHINGTON pec. 4.â The report o'f
General J. C. Breckinridge, inspector
general of the army, earnestly recom
mends that the benefits of the law of
March 3, 1S99, providing 1 for the retirement
of officers of the navy, under certain con
ditions, with the rank and pay of -the
neit higher grade, be extended to include
officers of the army.-" Â¦
Mostof our wars have been fought on
land, says the report, and as a matter of
simple justice, rewards for army . officers
should be no less extensive than those en-
Joyed by officers of thu naval branch.
The report touches also upon the disad
vantages Imposed by Inferior rank In the
army, citing as an Instance the China
campaign, when General Chaffee, a junior
among the commanders, was advanced
from a brigadier to a major general to
give him the rank requisite to his status
as commander-ln-chlef of the United
RECOMMENDS CHANGES
IN AHHTY BETHtEMENTS
BERLIN, Dec- 4.â Many of the Import
ant Journals, like the Post, Tageblatt and
National Zeitung, . refrain from comment
on President McKinley's message/Other
papers speak of the wid, 'Â¦ even threatening
language it is said to contain In regard to
Germany.
The Vosslsche Zeitung- says: "It is
noticeable "that President McKinley refers
very , coolly to . America's . relations with
Germany.- As in important state docu
ments of this kind every word has been
carefully read beforehand, it is un
doubtedly significant that President Mc-
Kinley should describe the relations with
France and England as friendly,, whereas,
speaking of relations- with Germany, he
merely remarks that they show 'evidence
Of good will.* Such a distinction cannot
but be intended and is Â«U1 the more sur
prising In view of the very friendly speech
to Germans delivered' by Embassador
White at the Thanksgiving dinner of the
American colony." â¢ .
LONDON, Dec. 4.-*-Comment on Presi
dent McKinley's message to Congress is
chiefly -devoted to 'the references to
America's Chinese policy. The-. Dally
Graphic says: "The policy of the -United
States regarding China is not heroic, but
it is certainly practical and there.ls ample
reason to believe that it will prevail."
The Times says: , "The message makes
It clear that on the vital point of insist
ing upon punishment -for the outrages
Mr. McKinley remains firm. We are glad
to see that on the subject of guarantees
for Christian . converts the President
makes a new proposal in advance of any
put forward elsewhere. In regard to the
indemnity question he is in agreement
with some of the best opinion in Eng
land." The Times editorially concludes
with an expression of the hope "that Mr.
McKinley's second term may be marked
by "a satisfactory settlement of all out
standing questions between Great Britain
and America.".
â¢ The Daily News says: ' '"The message
contains nothing new t and nothing very
illuminating on matters that are old. It
will be very closely scanned for its ref
erences to China. Jt looks as though the
American formula were ' that the powers
are to specify the culprits and .the Chi
nese Government is to specify the pun
ishment. On such terms a speedy settle
ment would undoubtedly be possible, but
would it be effective or durable?"
The Standard, which agrees with the
Times that if all the powers had with
drawn after the legations were relieved
to the same extent as the United States
there would not now be much chance of
satisfaction, remarks: "The excessive
anxiety to re-establish trade with China
is, perhaps, the real explanation of some
points that have not seemed satisfactory
in the recent policy of the United States.
In the opinion of the Standard, the
Washington Government has "acted aa
a drag on European diplomacy."
The Daily Chronicle observes: "Clearly
the United States Government is able to
boast of a,n aggregate of imports and ex
ports exceeding- two billions, and to pro
pose a reduction of revenue taxation to
the extent of thirty mllllons. : The admin
istration has a fair justification, even if
there be no very obvious need, for fur
ther, encouraging the American mercan
tile marine."

SPECIAL NOTICES.Superior Judge Troutt on- -appeal, and
two others *are now on appeal before
Judge Belcher. The present action is not
brought with a view to obtain any dam
ages, but is simply to recover what we
believe to have, been unlawfully collected
by the express company. Farrell takes
the stand that tho company has no right
to exact the payment of the war tax
from its patrons.
'â¢The suit brought by Farrell." said At
torney Squires, "is to settle this issue
once and for all. There ha ye been three
judgments obtained against the company

A TERRIBLE WRECK
WALTER HIRSCHFELD, man
ager of the Radam's Microbe
Killer Company, at 1366 Mar
ket street, committed suicide
yesterday afternoon by shoot
ing himself. through the head with a re
volver. \ The manager destroyed his life
in his place of business and his lifeless
body was found by a clerk whom he ~ad
sent from the place on an errand a short
time before. Business difficulty is given
as the cause of the act.
Shortly before 2 o'clock yesterday after
noon Hirschfeld returned from his lunch
and his mood was exceedingly 1 gloomy. He
devoted some time to writing letters and
then dispatched his clerk, Fred Turner of
1208C Howard street, to mall them at a
nearby box. Turner completed his errand
and returned to the store. When he
opened the door he was startled to find
the lifeless body of his employer stretched
before him in a pool of blood. A pistol
lay near, the corpse and a bullet that had
been fired from It had passed entirely
through the dead, entering Just above the
left temple. Turner Immediately called
help â¢ and the body was taken to the
Morgue. â¢ Â«"
According to the story of Turner.
Hirschfeld did not intimate to any one
that he, was tired of. life. He seemed in
good spirits during the morning and it
was not until after he returned from
lunch that he appeared at all depressed.
Turner ; denies knowing anything of
Hirschfeld's business affairs.
Ir ~- HIr Â«chfeld when seen at her home.
608 O'Farrell street, said that her hus
band mentioned money matters many
times and said that he was in a quandry
aa.to how to liquidate his debts. At noon
yesterday he came, home and was very
cheerful. He said that he thought he
couldmrrange everything In a satisfactory
mannrr and was jubilant over prospects
When leaving, however, he called his wife
and kissed her good-bye. He passed out,
but again returned and once more kissed
her. What her husband's monetary diffi
culties -were. Mrs. Hirschfeld refused to
say. .,
Hirschfeld was 32 years of age. Six
months ago he was divorced from his
wife and the couple lived apart for five
months. Their little boy, 2 years of age
was the cause of their coming together
again, and they were remarried about one
month ago. Mrs. Hirschfeld said that
their domestic peace had not been dis
turbed since that time.

FIRES A BULLET INTO HIS HEAD AND HIS LIFELESS BODY IS

afternoon. Mrs. Lovell White, president
Â«f the club, presided Â«t the meeting. Miss
Katherir.e M. Ball, chairman of the de
partment of education, discussed the work
be-Injr dene in her section. Dr. Dorothea
}&rcr* presented an interesting re-
port on the â¢ work being done by
the civic section. Mrs. Arthur W. Corn
wall read a paper on the labors of the so
cial science section, and Mrs. Sharon told
of the efforts of the members of her de
partment to have the Federal Government
enact laws. tl at will aarefthe forests of

on an- incoming producing basis. A pre
amble and resolution newly prepared will
be sent to the California Representatives
at Washington with the resquest that

receipt* was filed yesterday in the Jus
tices" court by E. M. Farrell. through his
attorney, George D. Squires. The sum
aeked from the company by Farrell is but
5 cents, but the decision of th,e suit will
determine whether the shipper of goods
can be compelled to pay the 1 cent tax
on each shipping receipt.
"This case is .entirely dissimilar to one
brought by Attorney General Maynard of
Michigan against the American Express
Company. This was a writ of 'mandate
to compel the company to take a package
without the exaction of the war tax. The
court decided, however, that the com
pany could increase its rates so as to in
clude the war tax charged on bills of lad
ing We contend that Wells, Fargo &
Co. did not increase its rates when It
charged Farrell 51 W to carry the five
packages, since the company Itself ac
knowledges that to be its regular sched
ule. It. however, shifted the burden of the
wir tax to Us patron."
