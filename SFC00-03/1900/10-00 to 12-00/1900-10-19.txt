DIBBLE THE CHIEF FIGURE
IN ANOTHER PUBLIC SCANDAL
Henry C. Dibble, candidate for tlie Assembly from the, Forty-first
Assembly District, is again the central figure in an unsavory trans
action of the last Legislature. To assist the passage of a bill to pro
tect oil pipe lines from vandals, Zlwood Bnrq^r was retained by
Captain Barrett. Bruner's fee was $50. Soon after his retention he
asked Barrett for $200 more, $100 of which, he said, was to go to
Dibble, chairman of the Rules -Committee, and 51OO more to the
chairman of the Judiciary Committee, two committees that could
hold the bill indefinitely unless proper arguments were made.

Captain Barrett wanted the bill passed.
It was a good measure demanded by the
residents of the Coallnga oil district. He
had been In Sacramento a sufficient
length of time to hear the whispered
comment concerning the Committee on
Rules and its chairman, Assemblyman
Dibble of the Forty-first Assembly Dis
trict. Captain Barrett reflected, and re
called that story of Zaccheus who climbed
a tree. It occurred to him that Zaccheus
came down and the lesson was not lost.
Other Incidents In the career of a bill
in the Assembly- were considered at the
business session In the lawyer's office.
Bruner told the captain that $200 more
would be required to jog the bill along.
According to the captain's version of the
Interview, Bruner said it would be Im
possible to have the. bill passed unless
he employed the chairman of the Judi
ciary Committee, and Dibble, who was
chairman of the Committee oa Rules, and
each one would charge $100.
pay $50 to Mr. Bruner for drawing up a
bill and looking, out .for, the measure in
the Legislature.
The next day business negotiations were
resumed, but the scene of action was
shifted from the theater to the law office
of Elwood Bruner. It may be well to
observe here that~ the '$50 transaction' was
perfectly fair. The fee was modest, show
ing that the lawyer had no desire to rob
his old whist partner. The legislation
sought for was demanded by the legiti
mate oil industry. It is the inference,
therefore, that Captain Barrett would not
ask his Pacific Grove whist partner to
draw up a bad bill. â¢ .*. Â¦

In 1S38, a few months before the regular
session of the Legislature of 1899 con

were sojourning at Pacific Grove. In
whlling away the time whist playing was
a favorite amusement, and each recog
nized in the other the qualities of a. su
perior player. They met every day for
two weeks and became fairly well ac
quainted. In February, 1899, they happen

were cordial, and Mr. Bruner remarked,
"What are you doing in Sacramento, Cap

was interested in oil and was there to
see Senators Flint and Rowell and As
semblyman Fairweather regarding some
measure for the protection of pipe lines.
The following day Captain Barrett and
Mr. Bruner again met The captain said
he had a matter of business to present

for the defense. Ho said .the testimony
In thecase did not show even circumstan

most that could be said was that some
suspicious circumstances existed as t<j

way to deseribe-hlm; that nicketts* Im

Second, that the testimony of accom

The defense put on two witnesses, who
said they had tried it and could not hear
a man running down the steps. This
closed the testimony for both sides, and
about 8 o'clock the Judge read the Instruc

is as follows:
"Arthur Goebel and I had a conference
with Colonel Nelson and -Colonel Craw

Colonel Nelson. I gave Colonel Nelson a
copy of the statement Youtsey had made
to me and pome questions that I wanted
Youtsey to answer. I told him that Yout

before any recommendation could be made
to the commonwealth's attorney for im

answer the questions we filed and make a

of that conference. The paper read from

FORMER GOVERNOR W. P. DILLINGHAM. WHO HAS BEEN ELECT
ED UNITED STATES SENATOR BY THE LEGISLATURE OF VER
MONT. THE CHOICE BEING MADE ON THE THIRD BALLOT.
At Madison one of the largest crowds
fathered since the special train reached
outh Dakota greeted the speakers. Sen
ator Hanna, who spoke for about ten
minutes, repeated that statement he made
In Ohio that If he could be shown that
In a single Instance he had denied a hear
ing to one of his 6000 employes or had re
fused to consider any grievance presented
by a single man or a committee from a
labor organization he would resign from
the United States Senate, "because since
the Republican party has called meJonce
more to the responsible position of Wn
pp!ng the campaign I feel that -I have
the right and it is my duty to tell the
rt-ople of my country that when Mr.
Bryan and his demagogical supporter? go
before the people of this country and call
me a labor crusher that it is not true.
And I leave to the ladies whether I have
horns or not," said Mr. Hanna, amid
laughter.
SIOUX FALLS. S. D.. Oct. lS.-Woon
pocket turned out a large crowd to hear
the Republican leaders, many farmers
with their harvest hands driving in from
("stances of twenty miles. At Mitchell,
the county eeat of f)avison County, the
largest crowd had gathered since Senator
Hanna spoke at Madison, Wis. The meet
ing was made a gala day In Mitchell and
excursion trains from points within fifty
miles brought hundreds of outsiders. Here
Senator Hanna made an emphatic denial
of the reports concerning Governor Roose
velt's recent trip through the West. He
said:
I am torry that thoge who are leading: the
opposition have Â«o far forgotten the dignity
which eurrounds the high office of the Presi
dency of this *rÂ«?at- nation as to descend, as
Mr. Bryan has. Into . personal abuse. I say It
Is an exhibition - of small appreciation of the
hiKh office to Tvrhlch he aspires to descend to
public lying from the rostrum every day. Why,
my friends, when Governor Roosevelt was in
your Stateâ that young champion of liberty.' a
man who - has displayed his courage upon the
battlefield, a man who through all his public
life haa been devoted to the highest principles
of reform in government, a man whose chief
characteristics are known everywhere, his
nine Is known to be integrity and abilityâ

At Alexandria and Brldewater similar
MADISON. Wis., Oct. IS.â The first stop
made by Senator Hanna's train to-day
was at Flandreau, where a big audience
had gathered, the crowd including 150
boys and girls from the Government In
dian Industrial School, located at Flan
dreau. and several former members of
Chief Little Crow's Sioux Band, who arc
now land-holders in this section. De
spite extreme hoarseness. Senator Hanna
made a rather extended address, taking
up the question of "Imperlalltm," moro
fully than he has yet discussed it, and
arguing that he whole issue was simply
an effort of Mr. Bryan and other Demo
cratic leaders to make political capital
out of the war with Spain, the full
credit for the successful conclusion, Sena
tor Hanna claimed, they, were afraid the
Republican party would receive. Sena
tor Frye also spoke a few words, as did
Mr. Dolliver. At Egan, the next station,
Mr. Hanna spoke for about five minutes.
"When, the election of next No
vember is over." iÂ»aid- Mr. Hanna,
"there will be no moit' Bryanism. There
must always be two parties. An honest
difference on political and economic ques
tions must exist, but four years ago
Jeffersonian Democracy was defeated
through the ambition of a certain man
nnd the efforts of certain other men.
When Mr. Bryan suggested free silver as
an antidote for the evils existing four
years ago he found many listeners among
the many Republicans who were ready to
aocept any theory ; rather than ha\-e a
continuance of those times. But finally
McKinley was elected and that money
which will endure < the storms of all
finances is the foundation of your secur
ity. And we must admit that free silver
is not the remedy" for commercial and
financial troubles. Z*
Declares That After the Election
There Will Be No More of
Bryanism.
HANNA'S STRAIGHT TALK.
York to-day a serious quarrel
was precipitated in the Democratic or
ganization, with Frank Campbell, chair
man of the -Democratic State Committee,
in the center of the melee. Mr. Campbell,
who is in charge of Mr. Bryan's special
train, in an interview disparaged the ef
fect of the Democratic candidate's tour,
saying that the demonstrations en route
reminded him much of the gTeat reception
which David B. Hill received in 1S94, and
yet Hill was beaten for Governor by 150,
000. This statement from such a source
damages beyond " repair the Democratic
claims that they will carry the State for
Bryan by 30.000 plurality. So angry are
Mr. Bryan's local supporters that they
are talking of deposing Mr. Â¦Campbell
from the State chairmanship.
Benjamin B.Odell Jr., chairman of the
Republican State Committee, amplified his
claim of 100,000 plurality for McKinley in
this State. It seems that Odell in his cal
culations is conceding 70,000 to Bryan in
Greater New York,-, although he does not
expect him to receive anything like that
vote. This means that the Republican
managers expect McKinley to "come down
to the Bronx" with 170,000 plurality.
President McKinley and his managers
are said to be considerably annoyed at
the attitude of high dignitaries in the
Catholic church. Influence seems to be
working against McKinley in ecclesiasti
cal circles in Maryland, Indiana and other
States, where there is a large Catholic
vote. This is due to the Philippine ques
tion, and Archbishop Corrigan is under
stood to have written letters ' from the
Philippines encouraging this opposition.
The President was astonished when he
learned this, because he had been expect
ing to have the quiet support of the Cath
i olic prelates.
United States Senator Lindser of Ken
tucky, who was a gold Democrat in 1S96.
came out squarely for McKinley and
Roosevelt last night. He - predicts the
flection of Yerkes, the Republican can
, didate for Governor of Kentucky, by a
tremendous majority, and says that the
State will give its electoral vote to Me
: Kinley. Wesly M. Oler of Baltimore pre
| diets that Maryland will give McKinley
20,000 plurality because of the money
issue.
Richard Croker to-night made a bet of
$10,000 to $40,000 on Bryan, the McKinley
end of the wager being taken by Jacob
Field. With one exception, this Is the
largest bet of the campaign. The excep
tion is the wager of $50,000 to $20,000. made
by Louis Wormser with Mr. Croker. The
bet was made at Delmonico's. Mr. Field
offered to give odds of 4 to 1 on McKinley,
and Jack McDonald, the bookmaker, who
had a torami3Pion from Mr. Croker, ac
cepted the proffer and agreed to take the
Bryan end for $10,000. As soon as the
matter was arranged. Mr. McDonald In
quired if there were any more McKinley
money to be had at the same odds.
"Yes." Mr. Field replied. "I have $3*Â».000
more to place at that figure." No other
wager was made.
A prominent New Jersey Judge to-day
wagered $5000 on Bryan against $20,000 on
McKinley with a well-known Wall-street
banker. For good. reasons the names of
the bettors were withheld.

AMERICA MAKES
A FINE SHOWING
AT EXPOSITION
Archbishop John Ireland
Tells of the Good That
Will Result.
Wondrous Natural Resources and the
Industrial Products Are Wow-
Known to the World as
Never Before.
"The wondrous natural resources in
which America abounds and her industrial
products are known to the world as never
before. Already, as I heard from exhibit
ors, a strong cu-mand has set in for the
products of her fields and of her work
shops artd the pronts accruing from such
demand more than cover to-day the ex
penses of participation in the exposition.
"It is seen ana understood now in the
world so clearly that they who run may
read that there lies between the Atlantic
and Pacific a country of astonishing
achievements and of possibilities yet more
astonishing.
"A new era has set In for us In our
co:Â»wnercial and diplomatic relations.
With the opening of the twentieth century
America steps into the front rank of na
tions and none there are who refuse to her
the place she is entitled to. For all this a
large award of praise must be allotted to
her part in the Paris Exposition.
"In several American sections of the ex
position everything is gathered that would
g-o to make America known to the world.
Agricultural, forestry and mining exhib
its set out her rich natural resources, a
display of manufactured articles allow no
doubt of the unrivaled achievements of
this country's Industrial genius, while the
educational and fine art exhibits illustrate
to the surprise and wonderment of stran
gers its political and social conditions,
"The. total number of awards allotted to
America is 2204, of which 215 are grand
prizes 547 gold medals. 503 silver medals,
501 bronze medals and 348 honorable men
tions.
"The total number of awards to Ger
many is 2GS9. those to Russia 29S5 and
those to Great Britain and Ireland 2959."
"The results from America's participa
tion in the exposition are summed up,"
says the Archbishop, "in an increased
commerce with foreign nations, Increased
investments of foreicn capital in her
mines, railroads and industrial enterprises,
and last, but certainly not least, in the
increased esteeem In which we will hence
forward be held by foreign nations.
NEW YORK, Oct. IS.â Archbishop John
Ireland of St. Paul, just returned from an
extended trip abroad, gave to-day his im
pressions of America's showing at the
Paris Exposition. The prelate took a fa
vorable view of this, and said that Amer
ica had taken a great stride forward in
the estimation of other nations.

14 accounted for the.% increased en
ergrÂ« He replied, with . merry,
When he was asked if he received $250
from Captain Barrett he said he did re
ceive It. He was asked if he gave Dibble
$100. He repplied, "I did not pay Dibble
one dollar," and' added: "Yes, that is for
publication. I authorize you to say that I
did not pay Dibble a dollar and did not
tell Captain Barrett that Dibble would
charge J100."
When the "confidential limit" was off
Mr. Bruner was asked this question: "If
you had paid - Dibble $100. $1000 or any
other sum for the Committee on Rules
would you acknowledge the fact of such
payment?"
-Mr.. Bruner replied: "I would tell you
that it was none of your business, or I
would say nothing. If under the same
circumstance I had paid you, what would
you think of me for telling of it? â¢ Wouldn't
you consider me a ?"
The Governor had objections to the bill,
but Elwood Bruner had no objection to an
interview. The "confidential limit" was
put on or off. "When he said everything
that he had a mind to say in confidence
he was asked to speak for publication.
He was not hurried. Time was given him
to change his gait. ,
The Governor's objection to the bill .was
discovered .by the friends of the measure.
The Senatorial contest of the regular ses
sion was then pending. Senators Rowell
and Flint, who were voting against Burns,
â¢were advocates of the bill, and Thomas R.
Bard, Â¦who was subsequently elected
United States Senator, was president of
the oil company of which Frank Barrett
was manager. It Is said that intelligence
reached the Governor's office that Messrs.
Bard, Flint and Rowell desired the ap
proval of the bill, hence Governor Gage
pocketed it.

In each house:
March 29â Pocketed.
On March 13, In the Assembly, a motion
was made to amend. The motion was car
ried and the bill was amended. On the
fame day the motion to amend was recon
sidered and Mr. Cowan was given unani
mous consent to withdraw his Amend
ment. The amendment was to strike out
"all after the â¢word 'line' " and Insert in
lieu thereof the following: "Is guilty of
a misdemeanor,"
Assembly â March 18, In Assembly to en
rollment; reported correctly enrolled, and
to Governor.
He was asked if he did not expend the
money to overcome the obstacles inter
posed by the committee on rules but
standing on his rights as a lawyer, he de
clined to say anything regarding the dis
bursement. Special stress was laid on the
privileges enjoyed by an attorney
When asked â¢Â¦ If the chairman of the
committee on rules under such prlvllpireq
would be Justified In accepting a fee of
$100 to advance a bill, he declined to ex
press an opinion. He fancied that the
committee on rules as now constituted
was a new thing in the Legislature, and
he remarked that such a committee did
not exist when he was in the Legislature
If masterlystyle of evasion in commun
ications other than those of a confidential
character be regarded as a desirable at
tribute of a disbursing agent in the leg
islature-Mr. '. Bruner. may be. commended
to those who . have secret business to
transact with the legislators.
When the limit was taken off the attor
ney explained that the bill was blocked,
but he would not admit that it was block
ed by Dibble and the chairman of the
Judiciary committee. He ascribed much of
the blocking to the Indifference of Fair
weather, who had another bill ahead- of
the oil measure, and' the perversity of
Senator Rowell. It was shown to Mr.
Bruner that the bill was not "held up" in
the Senate. His attention was time and
again cited to the fact attested by ! the
history of the measure that the bill went
to the Senate on March 13 and was finallv
passed on March 18. When there was no
argument to offer to sustain his position
regarding delay in the Senate Mr. Bruner
disputed the correctness of the history
and lamented the lack of generosity unon
the part of Captain Barrett. When press
ed for an answer as to whether the delay
was not caused by the Committee on
Rules the attorney said he could not spur

Pairweather was the theme of a pro
tracted spell of eloquence. Mr. Bruner ad
mitted for publication that he knew Dib
ble by sight and had heard 'that therp
was a committee on rules.
Elwood Bruner Insisted that he had a
right, as attorney to expend the $230 as he
pleased to advance the bill, and that he
was. authorized by Captain Barrett to use
his own Judgment in the disbursement
Moreover, Mr. Bruner asserted that more
than $250 was expended. When asked
how It was expended he answered- "That
is my business as an attorney, and not
BILL WAS BLOCKED.
Fair-weather and Rowell Blamed by
Bruner for Impeding Its
Progress.
There were many little Incidents con
nected with the progress of the bill that
he did not care to discuss for publication,
which he desired to refer to in order to
make his course clear. There were ref
erences to delays caused by Senator Row
ell and Assemblyman Falrweather He
said frankly that he regarded his employ
ment by Captain Barrett as perfectly
legitimate. He spoke also of having been
letained as counsel for Public Administra
tors and being in a position to assist Can
tain Barrett in the oil legislation. lie i
vas strong in the contention that he ex- j
ponded more energy and time than $250 I
voulo. pay for In Captain Barrett's oil
bill. Mr. Bruner recollected that he wrote
and wired to Captain Barrett, but he was
not sure that he asked for more money
He had the impression that he asked for
additional payment.
The attorney, when asked If the Com
mittee on Rules, Dibble chairman, wanted
another $100, replied that he did not pay
L>lbble a cent. He further remarked:
And if you say in The Call that I said
that Dibble was paid $100 by me I will
have the statement contradicted by everv
paper in the State." *
The limit was put on to get some Idea
why Mr. Bruner at first taxed Captain
Barrett $50 when they were at the theater
and subsequently raised the amount to
$250. The captain and Mr. Bruner agree
that $50 was the sum mentioned in the box !
at the theater. " |

fulness. The retirement of Prince Ho
her.lohe is the principal theme of dlscus
plon here. The Agrarian and Liberal press
say the Chancellorship has practically
long been vacant. The press generally
adopts an expectant attitude and there is
murh curiosity as to Count von Bulow's
policy In respect to the Prussian Diet and
the imperious demands of the Junker
squirearchy. The general feeling Is that
a strone. young statesman becomes the
re^nonslble chief in command of the state
and empire.
ACCEPTANCE OF FEANCE'S NOTE
Exact details as to Baron von Stern
burg's recall are impossible to obtain, as
none of the officials of the German em
bassy will talk about the matter, and the
State Department does not seem to be
fully advised on the subject. It Is known,
however, that Baron von Sternburg, while
endeavoring to carry out the several in
structions he had received, presented pro
posals to this Government in a more con
ciliatory fashion than the Berlin author
ities had contemplated. BeinK on the
ground. Baron von Sternburg appreciated
that It would be advisable in the interest
of harmonious relations between both
governments for him to be less positive
than his instructions required.
Count von Bulow's appointment as
Chancellor in succession of Prince Hohen
lohe was to-day officially confirmed by
7.1 r. Jackson. American Charge d' Affaires
in Berlin. Mr. Jackson added that "no
crisis and no change in policy of the Gov
ernment is probable." It seems to be the
general Impression that the chance is not
significant, for the reason that Count von
Bulow's advice has been that which
has KTUided the Emperor in the Chinese
policy pursued. It If thought likely that
Count von Bulow will continue the policy
already Inaugurated of endeavoring to ac
complish the aims which are set forth in
the several notes he has written, and which
to the officials here are all the more Im
portant in view of the action taken in the
ense of Baron von Sternburg.
Baron von Sternburg left New York on
the steamer Deutsehland last Tuesday for
Berlin. Among ;he friends of Baron von
Sternburg in the official circle here deep
purprise was felt when the news of his re
moval from Washington was first noised
about. His relations with the administra
tion were of a most cordial character and
the officials generally conceded that he
was doine much to make a satisfactory
solution in China possible.
CALL BUREAU. WELLINGTON HO
TEL, WASHINGTON. Oct. 18.â Distrust
of Germany's attitude in China has been
revived as a result of information re
ceived here, showing the hostility of the
Berlin Government to the policy of concil
iation in the settlement of the Far East
ern Question. It was learned to-day on
high authority that the recall of Baron
Speck von Sternburg, German Charge
dAffaires, was due to this efforts to
smooth the road looking to a prompt and
peaceful solution of the Chinese troubles.
Germany's Chinese Policy.
Baron Von Sternburg's Recall Due to
DISTRUST IS BEVTVED.
The President is expected to designate
in a fevi- days Minister Conger and per
haps General Wilson as the American
peace neg-otiators. No one will be sent
fr*om the United States. ..-./, .^ * .
The President's answer to Kwang Hsu's
letter was a perfunctory acknowledgment
of thanks for the expression of gratitude
on the part of the Chinese Emperor and
of his purpose to facilitate the negotia
tions for peace as much as possible.
So far as evident, the proposals are
general suggestions only. They are some
what similar to the French proposals re
cently considered in that they are intend
ed to comprise a programme which will
guide the negotiators in effecting a settle
ment. While China recognizes the right
of the powers tc demand the punishment
of the guilty, ehe calls attention to the
punishment alreedy meted out to the re
epons'ble authors of outrages and to the
purpose underlying this action to admin
ister strict Justice. She aJso recognizes
that the powers should be Indemnified,
but to what extent and In what manner
are to be determined by the negotiations.
The mciFt Important feature of the pro
posal, perhaps, is the fact that China rec
ognlzes the right of the powers to Insist
upon guarantees against a recurrence of
the trouble and 10 demand reparation in
the Â¦way of punishment of the responsible
authors of the outrages and proper in
demnity.
But China does not propose to let the
powers have it all their own way, and
Ehe in her turn is said to insist upon the
withdrawal of the troops. No reference
is made to the native Christians, this be
ir.g a detail which will be discussed dur
ing: the negotations.
In advance of a consultation among the
powers on the Chinese proposals the au
thorities are Jisincllned to make public
the character of the propositions sub
mitted to them. It is understood, how
ever, that there are five distinct propo
sals made, and in European diplomatic
quarters they are regarded to some ex
tent as fair and reasonable.

SAN JOSE. Oct. IS.â John Henyon, an
aged ranch laborer, met with a serious
accident on the Uvas Creek, six miles
from Almaden, last Monday, and when
found he was in a demented and de
lirious state and perishing from thirst.
For forty-eight hours he had lain at the
bottom of a steep embankment and,
bruised and bleeding, he was unable to
move and get a: drink of water, although
a sparkling stream ran within twelve feet
of where he lay and in plain view.
Henyon. who is 70. years old. is a pio
neer of this county. He works about the
ranches during the summer and in the
winter makes his home at Eugene Parr'a
ranch on the Uvas. Last Monday morn
ing he set out for Parr's place from this
city on foot. The old man was given a
ride until within a short distance of the
Parr place. Here he took a short cut of
half a mile through the hills. In follow
ing the bank of the Uvas Creek Henyon
tripped on a small stone and plunged
twelve feet over an embankment, landing
on the sharp rocks below. He was bruis
ed and hurt internally. For a time he
lay unconscious. He was unable to move
hands or limbs and his cries for help were
wasted. Hunger and thirst were soon
felt. After the old man had lain exposed
in his condition for forty-eight hours Mr.
Parr found a bundle of clothes where he
had fallen over the embankment and
took them home.

REDDING, Oct. 18.â Ridgley Canton of
Stockton won the Grand Encampment
trophy, valued at $200, and $100 in cash
to-day, representing the first prize in the
Odd Fellows competitive drill. Sacra
mento Canton took the second prize of
$lo0 and San Francisco the third of $100.
The Rebekah Drill Corps of Stockton and
San Francisco divided $150 between them
as per agreement before drilling. The real
contest lay between Sacramento and
Stockton cantons.
Each had won the trophy twice. A
third winning made the winner its owner.
The drill of this encampment was really
a "rubber" , between the two cantons
named, and. Stockton won out.
The miiitary movements of the different
bodies were witnessed by the largest
crowd that ever congregated in Redding*B
pleasure ground. The usual seating ca
pacity proved entirely inadequate, and
although additional seats were provided
hundreds of people were left standing.
With the ground hardened by the rain of
the morning, the sun hidden and a cool
breeze blowing the circumstances were
entirely favorable to the competition.
Colonel E. A. Forbes of Marysville. Major
Marion Pirkey of Willows and Captain
Sparrow acted as judges.
The cantons of Sacramento, San Kran
cisco and Stockton drilled in the order
named. Each, received vociferous ap
plause, although that accorded San Fran
cisco appeared slightly the largest in vol
ume. Each canton occupied half an
nour's time.
The cantons were followed by fancy
drills by the Rebekah Drill Corps of San
Francisco and Stockton. The perfect exe
cution of the many Intricate evolutions
by the pretty young ladies in natty uni
forms completely won the crowd. Hats
were thrown in the air and cheer fol

popular and efficient equipment officer at the Mare Island yard, a few days
ago received his commission as commander, and he has been the re

promotion. Commander Phelpa graduated from the Naval Academy
in 1S65. is a pon of Rear Admiral Thomas S. Phelps, U. S. N.. retired, and was
born In the Stato of Virginia. Hip popularity in the service Is well known by all
who have any acquaintance with the navy. Aboard ship his treatment of the
crew is such that he is universally respected and honored, and it is with difficulty
that a'pailor could be found whom "Tom" Phelps had ill treated. In the city of
Vallejo, where he has made l>is home for several years, he is universally re

VANCOUVER, B. C. Oct. 1R.âBlood
shed very nearly occurred in a row re
sulting- from a mutiny on the steamer
South Portland at Skaguay last Thurs
day. Thirty members of the crew re
fused to work and a company of colored
trooj-s drove thoni on board the ship
again at the point of the bayonet.
The South Portland iefl Seattle twci

hundred odd passengers having decided
to got off there and about ball the mem
bers of :he crew, thirty in all; quit work
and refused to do another hand's turn.
The captain threatened to put them in
irons and the men threatened light In re
taliation. Eventually ;tÂ»e men ail submit
tÂ«i to arrest and were taken to jail. Th'y
were discharged a short time afterward.
h'Owov?r. the officers of the ehit) having
decided not to take the case !nt^> court.
The men alleged that the captain and
officers h-id been drunk on the way up 10
Skaguay and were Incompetent to run
the vessel, which had touched bottom
sevora: times and h:id a narrow escape
from wreck. These reasons were given
why they declined to i>roceeÂ«I further in
her.
A consultation of the captain and the
American Commissioner was then hold
an<l tifty member* of the Twonty-fourta ,
xtreitnoitt (colored) turned out. They
were fuiiy armed and marched down t.Â»
the docks. The eeamen had not tried to
escape and public sympathy was very
much aroused in thÂ«ir favor. They were
.-again ordered on hoard and apain re- I
fused; whÂ»n the colored troops were com- i
unrated to charge Hum. "With drawn j

FRESNO, Oct. IS.â The Fresno County
Hospital was destroyed by fire at 10
o'clock to-night, the Ios3 being about
ICO.000.
The building was situated a mile east
of town and the fire department could
render no assistance. The loss was fully
covered by insurance. The cause of the
fire has not yet been ascertained, but it
is supposed to have been caused by a
defective flue.
The blaze was first noticed In the upper
part of the structure. The patients wera
warned and escaped from the building.
About half of them were able to get out
without assistance and the rest were car
ried to places of safety. The hospital con-.
talned about 130 Inmates. Most of, tbo
fixtures were also removed.
The destruction of the building wi'.l
probably result indirectly In the loss o*
several lives. Some of the patients were
very ill and it is feared that the excite
ment and sudden exposure will irt some
instances prove . fatal.
A.number of tents and other temporary
structures were erected to afford shelter
for such of the inmates as could not care
for themselves. With the Deciding and
furniture saved from the "burning build-
Ing they were made as comfort-able as
possible.
A new hospital will be erected without
delay.
It Is Feared, However, That the SudÂ«

Will Result in Several

A HOSPITAL
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 18.â The biggest
and most enthusiastic rally of an unpre
cedently quiet campaign took place to
night when Governor Gage addressed 5000
people at Hazard's Pavilion. The Gover
nor was escorted to the pavilion by the
Amerieus Club of Fasadena, 200 strong In*
white and gold uniforms, and the Charles
Sumncr Marching Club, an organization
of over a hundred well drilled colored
men, their ranks being headed by bands.!
At the pavilion "Teddy's Terrors," a band
of "busters" lately impressed, had aj
warm reception ready for the Governor.
Clad In Hough Rider costume they crap- '
tied their revolvers outside the pavilion
and surprised the house with their lungs
when they got within.
R- W. Burnham presided and Introduced
Governor Gage, who was very cordially
welcomed. The Governor was in good
form, but read his speech, which took
nearly two hours to deliver. Neverthe
less, the large audience listened with close
attention to the long address, which was
mainly devoted to a discussion of the
"Bryanite disguises" of imperialism and
militarism. Governor Gage said in part: '
"Once more the contest of 180*3 is re
newed and the issues which were then
disposed of have been resurrected, sub
jecting our country to another political
crisis. The Issues are the same. The
leaders arc the same, but the unfortunate
condition of the country which marked
the year 18?6 has vanished, whilo great
events,' which are epochs In the history
of the world as well as In the history of
America, have followed in rapid and mar
velous sequence, and our country, sur
mounting all obstacles and passing these
epochs, has grown greater and grander
than ever before."
The speaker reviewed the remarkable
revival of business under the McKinley
administration and the absolute failure of
Bryan's predictions. .After puncturing
the bogie men of Â¦ militarism ;Â«nd impe
rialism fiovernor Gage concluded:
Notwithstanding- the fact that the majority
of the voters of California feel assured that the
welfare of thi3 .State and nation demands the
election of William McKlnley and Theodore
Koosevclt, and that their success is certain,
we muft not overlook the importance of the
election of .Republican Congressmen from the
seven districts of this State, because it is as
essential for our own domestic Interests as
well as for the support of the Republican Na
tional administration that we should have a
stronpr Republican majority In the House of
Representatives. The election of all' Republi
can State, Legislative, county and township
officers is equally important, inasmuch as each
local Republican administration- will b4 an aid
to the general administration in carrying out
the pledges of the State Republican platform to
In addition to this we must not forget the
fact that the next State .Legislature will have
the important duty under our State constitu
tion of fixing and adjusting the Legislative dis
tricts and reapportloning the representation
according to the United States census of 1900.
The succesB of the democratic party In the next
Legislature would practically be to submit the
redlstrictlng of the State to partisan manipula
tion and to assist in a Democratic supremacy
in this State for many years. "Hence the Cali
fornia voter who believes in the doctrines of
protection to American labor and Industries
and of sound money and takes pride in the
past- and present glorious history of
our republic under the ' guidance* of Re
publican statesmen and who would have
America retain her splendid position as
the foremost nation of the world must
personally and energetically vote and work
for the election of all Republican nominees
local. State and national.

Pleased That His Challenge
Was So Quickly
Accepted.
LONDON, Oct. IS.â Misapprehension
having arisen over the wording of Sir
Thomas Upton's . challenge. Sir Thomas
asks the Associated Press to say the chal
lenge provides for three completed races,
and not three starts, as might be inferred
from the wording-.- In fact, it is exactly
thÂ© same as thiÂ£ conditions of last year,
unless, as was the case last year, the re
sult can be achieved in three races.
Commenting on the chances of Sham
rock II, the Yachting World says:
"At least we have the satisfaction of
knowing that those who will control the
boat have had more experience than was
available last time."
It is understood that the Shamrock II
will be built by the Hendersons on the
Clyde, and that Sycamore will be her
skipper, with Mr. Jameson In general
charge.
Sir Thomas Lipton will take both the
new and old Shamrock across the Atlan
tic. The contract for building the new
craft is not yet closed, but it is expected
that the work on Shamrock II will start
shortly.
Sir Thomas hopes to arrive in the
United States about the middle of July.
In an interview he said he was delighted
that his challenge had received such a
prompt and satisfactory answer. He
added:
"The only difference mentioned, that of
extending the time of the start from 11
a. m. to 2 p. m., seems a good idea, fair
to both and liable to produce less delays
and bring better sport. Crossing the
ocean does not bother me a bit."
"Suppose, Sir Thomas," he was asked,
"that the old Shamrock should beat the
new in the trials?"
"It is impossible," he replied Impres
sively.
"Talking of fair play," continued Sir
Thomas, "none of us Is quite infallible,
but I guarantee to say should anything
controversial by any chance happen to
occur 1 am certain 1 shall get the benefit
of any doubt existing, such is my belief
in the integrity and sportsmanship spirit
of the New York Yacht Club. The con
tinuation of last year's accident clause,
mentioned by Mr. Oddle, Is eminently sat
isfactory. It was my own suggestion and
I see no reason for any change. Some
people seem surprised at my challenging
with a cutter, and I have seen it stated
that I Intended taking over a 75-foot
schooner. The idea never entered my
head. I have worked continuously upon
the matter and you may be sure no data,
however small, will be overlooked which
might tend to make her successful."
SIR THOMAS IS

BRYAN TOURS EMPIRE STATE.
Talks Abont "Smearing the Flag
With tho Blood of Conquest."
SYRACUSE. N. Y.. Oct. 18.â W. J.
Bryan continued his tour of the Empire
State to-day, traveling- half-way across It
from east to west He began his journey
at Albany and following the course of the
picturesque Mohawk and the line of the
Erie canal he reached this point late in
the afternoon. From here he made a run
northward to the southern shore of Lake
Erie and made a half-hour's speech at
Oswego. He spoke here to-nfght.
The other points at which he spoke
during- the day were Schenectady, Fonda,
Johnstown, Gloversvllle, Amsterdam, Fort
Plain. Little Falls. Herklmer. Won.
Frankfort. Utica. Rome, Oneida. Canasto
ta, Chittenango and Dewitt. The attend
ance at a majority of the meetings was
complimentary in size and some of the
audiences were very large. In compara
tively few places was there any marked
enthusiasm. There was, however, close
attention and in no case was there any
Interruption of note. The Oswego meet
ing was the best attended and in other
respects the most notable of the day.
Mr. Bryan spoke from a balcony in front
of Stanwix Hall in Rome. Immediately
in front of him were suspended large
portraits of the Democratic nominees on
the national ticket, while a few steps
away the portraits of McKinley and
Roosevelt swung across the street. His
audience at this place was iarge and at
tentive and the speech was punctuated
with frequent bursts of applause. Ex
pressing his pleasure at being In Rome
Mr. Bryan said that the large attendance
could not be accounted for on the ground
of curiosity because he had been in this
city before and the people there had had
an opportunity to see and hear him. He
accused the Republicans of avoidance of
the real issues of the campaign and
asked:
Do they not Insult the Intelligence of Ameri
can citizens when they aFk their votes and
yet decline to outline what they are going to?
Read the platform of our party, compare It
with the platform of the Republican party and
you find the difference Is that the Democratic
position Is stated with a clearness that ad
mits of no ambiguity, while the Republican
party states Its position in glittering generali
ties and spends more time bragging about the
rain that the Lord has sent than in telling
of the Imperial reign that the Republican party
Intends to bring upon this country.
Referring to the trusts in his Utica
speech he said:
If the Democratic party Is Intrusted with
power it is pledged to put forth every effort
to destroy private monopoly in the nation.
State and city, and I think that even the Re
publicans now give me credit for being honest
in my determination to carry out the plat
form. In fact, a Senator said the other day
that that wa3 the objection to me, that I wu
honest and therefore dangerousâ an objection
that cannot be made to some Republicans who
have been In power. I have promised that
my Attorney General will not come from New
Jersey and I have promised that he will en
force the l_wÂ«. '
Closing his Rome address Mr. Bryan
said: .-'Â¦*'
I believe It was here the first American flag
was raised. J want you to look at that flag.
I want ycu to see If you can find on that flag
anything that represents a subject. The white
stands for the purity of our nation's motives;
'the red stands for the blood shed In the pur
chase of liberty, and the stars represent the
States, and every Territory sees in the future
a star of hope that is some day to find Its
piece in the constellation. But where In that
tlasr Is anything a subject or a vassal can look
to ajid love? I do ngt- want to change that
fla_. I would rather haul It dewn and let
the Filipinos have their own flag than change
our flag to the flag of an empire and smear
it with the blood of conquest.
Mr. Bryan made ten-minute speeches at
the four towns of Oneida. Canastota,
Chittenango and Dewitt. At Oneida ho
said:
I - do not want to harbor an ambition that
re.'ts for its gratification on what other people
do. I want that my hone?t ambition Â«hail
rest for Its gratification on what I can do my
self, and my highest ambition Is the same as
yours should bÂ«, namely, to do what I can
to make this country so good that to be a
private citizen here will be greater honor than
to be a King in any other nation on earth.
The Canastota speech was made from
the carriage near the railroad station ami
was addressed to farmers. Mr. Bryan
spoke to the railroad men of "the full
dinner pail." He said that even if there
was a full dinner pail for the laboring
man It would be impossible to trace its
existence to the Republican party. "The
labor organizations of the country have
done more for labor." he said, "in the
last few years than the Republican party
could do In a century."

depends, it is understood, entirely upon
the operator &.
The feeling Is prevalent here to-night
that the decision of the operators* meet
ing at Seranton to-day to Insist that the
reduction in the price of powder must b,s
taken Into consideration in determinii;a
the net 10 per cent increase in wages,
has complicated matters somewhat.
Further delay in reaching an amicable
adjustment of the trouble is now feared.
The rituation otherwise is precisely the
came as that which obtained when the
first notice of the coai companies -was
posted. Then, as now, the Reading Com
pany was the first to post a notice of an
advance in wages and was quickly fol
lowed by other large coal companies and
nearly all the smaJler Individual opera
tors, after which Mr. Mitchell Issued the
call lor the Scranton convention.
Lp to to-r.ight four companies in the
H&Zieton district have posted notices ac
cepting the Scranton convention's de
mands. They are the I^ehlgh Valley Coal
Company, operating hnlf a dozen collier
ies in this vicinity; Pardee & Co., two
collieries; Van Wyckle estate, two collier
ies, ar.d A. Pardee & Co.. one collier}'.
Air. Mitchell is extreme^" reticent. It
is supposed he desires to hear reports
from the district officers before making
s-py public expressions as to the possi-
Lilities of an early rrsumption of work.
A meeting of United Mine Workers was
heid here to-day and arrangements were
made for holding a labor demonstration
in this city next Monday. The feature
of the demonstration will be a parade,
followed by a mass-meeting, at which
l*r*-s=idÂ«;r.t Mitchell will be tho principal
speaker. â¢ The Mayor of this city, who re
luSed to allow the strikers to parade two
weeks ago, has granted permission fcr
the demonstration next week.
SCHANTON. Pa.. Oct. IS.âRepresenta
tives of nearly all the Lig ooaJ companies
cf the region conferred here to-day and
made an agreement to amend the notice*
already posted by attaching to them:
"In further explanation of the above
notice this company desires to say that
it is tho intention to pay the advance in
wages above noted unti; April 1, 1901. and
thereafter until further notice."
The following statement was issued to
the press:
"Tne representatives of the larger com
panies at their meeting to-day stated in
reply to inquiries that they had offered
their men a lu per cent advance as indi
cated by the notices they had posted: that
this notice- specifically stated that the re
duction of powder from 12 75 to $1 50 would
be considered in arriving at the wages of
their contract miners. It was expected
when the notices were posted that the
offer was to stand until April 1. and in
definitely thereafter, but inasmuch as
there eefrns to be some misunderstanding
In this matter, they have agreed to add
to the'.r notice a clause to the effect that
it is their intention to pay the advance in
wages until April 1, 1901, and thereafter
until further notice."
The conference was held in the office of
the Temple Iron Company, and was at

Dll'-hrr of the United Mine Workers have
p.'.] been ouoted as saying that the resolu
tions of the Scranton convention contem
plated a straight advance of 10 r>er cent
fnr all rarts of the region, and that the
matter of having this increase made up In
r-nrt by a decrease In cost of powder in
i hope urpcr regions, where powder is sold
for 12 TT, n kep. was not agreed to The
powder question, they one and all paid
wss lÂ«*t out of the present negotiations.'
with the understanding that it was to be
nnde one of the prrievÂ«inccs to be adjusted
In the conferences â¢which, the offer says,
the operators agree to have with the men
to "take in any grievances they may
have."
President Mitchell, who was informed
by telephone of the act of the operators,
stated that he would have to decline to
discuss its probable effect in regard to a
settlement until he had given the matter
careful consideration. He would not sav
whether it would be possible to deal with
the difficulty without calling another con
vention.
President Nichols, whose whole district
is affected by the powder question, said
this evening that it looked to him as if
another convention was necessary.
"I do not know that the delegates will
consent to waiving their demand for a
straight increase and allowing the substi
tution of this clause about powder, which
the operators are so insistent about,"
sai.l he. "But without their consent I
don't soe how the matter can bÂ« adjusted.
To me it looks like a prolongation of the
fight."
The Gibbon Coal Company's drift, which
supplies fuel for the city stores, started
! up this morning full-handed, with the ap-
I proval of the T'nited Mine Workers. It
i is understood that the company will mine
only sufficient coal to fill its contract with
the school district. The men are to receive
a straight 10 per cent advance. Fifty men
are omplcyed.
POPULATION OF ARIZONA
HAS GREATLY INCREASED
Returns Mad? Public by the Census
Bureau Show a Gain of 1O4.9
Per Cent.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 18.â The Census
Bureau to-day made public the returns of
population for the Territory of Arizona.
The population of the Territory in 1900 is
122,212, as compared with a population of
59.620 in 1S&X This shows an increase dur
lnr the decade of 62,592. or 104.9 per cent.
This larce increase is due in part to the
feet thai there were 2S.463 Indians and 104
other persons, or a total of 25,623 persons
on Indian reservations, etc., in Arizona,
who were enumerated In ISM under the
provisions of the census act, but were not
included in the general population of the
Territory at that census. The population
of th* Territory in 1S70 was 965S, and dur
ing the ten years from 1S70 to 1SS0 it in
creased 30.772. or 318.7 per cent, giving a
population in 1SS0 of 40.440. The population
in 1S90, as stated tn the report for that
census, was 59,620. representing an in
crease during the decade of 19.180. or 49 4
per cent.
The population of Arizona in 1900 is more
than twelve times as large as the popu
lation jriven for 1ST0, in the first census
taken after its organization as a Terri
tory in 1S53.
The total land surface of Arizona is ap
proximately 112,920 square miles.
BOERS VERY TROUBLESOME
CUTTING TELEGRAPH LINES
Their Attacks Are Becoming Intol

PRETORIA, Oct. IS.â The Boers are
daily tearing portions of the railroad and
cutting the telephone and telegraph wires.
Their attacks are Intolerable. The re
pairing linemen cannot leave the garri
soned points without considerable escorts.
The only remedy seems to be to corral all
the burghers and deport them, as appar
ently none of them can be trusted.

DELAY IN REACHING
STRIKE ADJUSTMENT
Tells Also of the Condition of the
Troops Who Have Been Sta
tioned in the Philippine
Islands.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 18.-The report of
Surgeon General Sternberg, United States
army, states that tho force or the medical
department consists of 192 officers, which,
he says. Is not enough in view of the
large number of defense stations and the
troops operating In Cuba. Porto Rico,
Hawaii and the Philippines. The con
tract surgeons have, rendered excellent
service, but the surgeon general thinks
the corps should be Increased. Refer
ence Is made to the good work the Army
Nurse Corps has performed. The medi
cal statistics in the report relate entirely
to the calendar year ib'jQ and nothing la
given concerning the statistics for 1900.
A report from the chief surgeon of the
Philippines, dated August 15. 1900, is
given, showing a percentage of S.5 sick
for the command, the total strength oi
the army in the Philippines at that time
being 60,534. The sick were divided as
follows:
Sick in quarters, 1261; sick in regimental
hospitals. 1119; sick in miUtarÂ«- hospitals
in department, 1241; sick in Manila,hos
pitals 150S. Total sick, 5129.
The surgeon general explains the condi
tions in the Philippines as follows:
"The exposures, fatigues and the excite
ments of a. prolonged campaign are re
sponsible for the large sick list and rela
tively large death roll among the soldiers
in the Philippines. However, the opinion-
Is prevalent among the medical officers
that in time of peace and colng only gar
rison duty the sick rate of the army in
the Philippines would be no higher than
it ordinarily Is in the Southern United
States."
The surgeon general has this to say on
the controversial subject of insanity
among the troops:
"In the army, regulars and volunteers,
during the calendar years 1899 and 1900,
there was reported on the monthly re
ports of elck and wounded 347 cases of
insanity and 202 of these cases, or 58.2 per
cent, were committed to the Government
Hospital for the Insane. One hundred
and thirty-live cases, or 66.7 per cent of the
commitments, recovered after an average
period of detention of 3.9 months. Thir
teen were improved, six died and forty
eight remained unimproved. Ninety-six
of the 347 cases were reported on the
monthly reports of troops serving in the
Pacific islands and thirty-two of these,
or 33.3 per cent, were sent to the Govern
ment I*ospltal for the Insane. Seventeen
cases, or 53.1 per cent of those committed,
recovered in an average period of 3.5
months; two were improved, two died and
eleven remained not improved."

Subject.

At every performance when this Joke is sprung McKinley's name Is re
ceived with loud applause. In fact, at all of the theaters a McKinley Joke
this year is more loudly cheered than a Joke that favors Bryan. Even on
the Bowery, a Democratic stronghold, where it is natural to suppose that
Bryan Jokes would go well, the Democratic candidate hasn't the better of
it with the audiences. Many of the comedians who work off political ga^s,
however, do so without prejudice to either candidate. A sketch team at Mi
ner's Bowery, which essays political humor, tries a McKinley verse, sung by
the male members of the team first, and then the female member switches
on to Bryan sentiment. So everybody Is pleased.
Here is a sample of the material turned out by talking comedians:
"Hello, pal. can you tell me where all the members of Tammany Hall are
equally beautiful?"
"Give it up."
"In the dark. But say! What does Bryan want the Presidency for any
how?"
"For Bryan. That McKinley, though. Is a dangerous man."
"Why is he dangerous?"
"He takes life cheerfully."
"Do you think they'll embalm Croker when he dies?"
"No. I trust ice will be cheap when he dies. That reminds me of what
my wife said to the ice that she put in the Icebox this morning."
"What did she say to the take of Ice?"
"You dear little thing."
"Speaking about Croker dying, what do you think his epitaph ought
to be?"
"His trust in the prophets was great, but his profits in the trusts were
greater.
"That was a touching incident."
"What?"
"Croker hitting the candidates for coin."
"I can tell you a capital thing for the candidatesâ cash."
"I got one lor you. Why is Bryan like- Oom Paul?"
"Give it up." '
"Because he's a great bore."
"When McKinley gets in he'll make a dollar bill go as far as a ten-dollar
"No, but they show which way the wind blows."
The most popular of this year's crop of campaign Jokes seems to be one
sprung at the Victoria Music Hall by the Rogers Brothers. Gus Rogers
starts in by saying that it looks as if McKinley will surely win.
"Why?" inquires his brother.
"There ere more McKinley banners than Bryan banners in town."
"Banners don't vote."

In deciding, even at this late day, to investigate the
ca.se of the notorious James Taylor Rogers the Bar
Association evidently believes that decency at home
is some guarantee of respect and repute abroad.
Another privilege of our policemen, almost sacred
in its antiquity, is being questioned with great se
rioufness. Two of the "finest" have been called to
account for condemning their superiors â a pastime
which e\-erybody indulges.
The Market Street Company has been ordered
once more by the Supervisors to remove its unused
rails in this city. This command has been given so
often that the offending company might introduce a
little novelty into the affair by obeying the command.
The Merchants' Association has made a most ex
traordinary request. It has asked the Board of Pub
lic Works to expend some money for the improve
ment of streets. Dors not the association know that
the Board of Public Works, as at present constituted,

The apostle of the "Truth Knowers" who fleeced

WHEN Owen Glendower proudly boasted, "I
can call spirits from the vasty deep," the
- skeptical Hotspur replied: "So can I, and so
can any man; but will they come?" Adlai Steven
son is one of the fellows who have spirits come when
he calls them. He has just given the county a proof
of it, but the proof is of a kind to which neither the
gifted Adlai nor any of his descendants to the re
motest generation will ever point with pride. In fact
the proof shows that Stevenson's spirits come even
when not called for, that they interfere with his intel
lectual make-up and render him ridiculous.
All that evidence is to be found in the current num
ber of the North American Review. Stevenson, with
several other distinguished gentlemen, vÂ»as invited to
contribute a paper to a symposium on "The Present
Duty of American Citizens." Mr. Stevenson of
course maintained that the duty of citizens at present
is to work for Bryan and himself, and to vote for their
electoral ticket on election day. By way of argument
he declared the country to be in grave danger from
thr growing power of money and commercialism,
and to confirm his theory he quoted to show "how
prophetically" Lincoln had been impressed by the
signs of danger from a letter said to have been written
by Lincoln in 1864 this passage: "But I see in th
near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and
causes me to tremble for the safety of my country. As
a result of the war corporations have been enthroned,
and an era of corruption in high places will follow,
ard the money power of the country 'will endeavor to
prolong its reign by 'working upon the prejudices of
the people until all wealth is aggregated in a few
hands and the republic will be destroyed."
The pa'ssage was duly published and was doubtless
hailed by the Bryanite quoters from Lincoln with
Rreat glee. The gladness, however, was short-lived.

PERSONAL MENTION.
There was a time when the Merchants' Association
appeared to possess considerable influence at the City
I Jail, but evidently that time has passed. In view of
pM these facts, therefore, it appears to be in order to
ask what Mayor Phelan intends to do at the end of
this fiscal year with the surplus of $200,000? Does h:
intend to devote it to some beneficent purpose or to
check it off in salaries for his "organization"?
Instead of raising Mr. Reed's figures to $200,000 and
passing the resolution unanimously, the Supervisors
permitted Mr. Phelan to refer it as introduced to the
Finance Committee. How much "hard work" will be
necessary to get it out of this committee later on no
man enn tell. Supervisor Reed is reported to have
f::id that he will certainly accomplish the task, but he
I: alone, and apparently outnumbered (including the
Mayor) by eighteen men.
At Monday's meeting of the Supervisors Mr. Reed
introduced a resolution declaring the intention of tho
board to appropriate Sioo.ooo out of any surplus funds
available at the end of the fiscal year for the recon
struction of these accepted streets. It is assumed that
the amount available will be $200,000. So Mr. Ree-i
displayed considerable self-abnegation in asking for a
division of the total sum between the people and the
politicians of this administration.
To a person unaccustomed to view things from a
"reform "political standpoint it would not seem neces
sary for anybody to "work hard" to get an appropria
tion for the prosecution of these street improvements,
all of which have been recommended by the Mer
chants' Association. Vet it appears that nothing short
of the hardest kind of work will accomplish such a
result.
Miles upon miles of these basalt blocked streets, in
deed, are a disgrace to American civilization, as well
as a standing menace to the safety of every person
vho travels over them in vehicles drawn by horses.
On July i. 1899. there were a little more than 18^
miles of accepted streets in this city. It is probably a
fact that not a dozen blocks of the vast area repre
sented by these figures are at the present moment in
the state of repair required by law. If there are any
blocks in first-class condition they would be the ex
ception* which would prove the rule. Many miles of
these streets are paved with cobbles, which long since
have been condemned as a material for street paving
ir every large city in the world. Many more miles of
them are paved with basalt blocks laid on sand â a
species of pavement which has been under the ban in
San Francisco for ten years.
Exactly why these two powerful influences should
have to "work hard"' for so beneficent and necessary
v a municipal pyrpose is not explained. So we are left
to infer that no matter how worthy the subject in hand
may be. "hard work" is necessary at the City Hall to
get any money for it.
WhjflT WILL HE DO WITri IT?
ACCORDING to a report from the City Hail
the Merchants' Association and Supervisor
Reed are "working hard" to get a portion of
the surplus expected from the increase in the assess
ment roll of the current fiscal year for the repaving
of certain accepted streets in the business portion of
That is the kind of representative California should
have at Washingtonâ one who looks after all the in
terests of our people, one who can be counted on to
work for every measure that tends to our welfare.
The Hon. Julius Kalin should be re-elected by a big
majority.
Thus in a recent address he said: "I am pleased to
say that the outlook for the passage of numerous bills
it; which our citizens nre interested is most promising.
Among these are^he bills to restrict the sale of con
vict-made goods to the States in which they are manu
factured. This bill passed the House and is now pend
ing before the Senate. The bill for the construction
of a cable to Hawaii and the Philippine Islands has
psssed the Senate and will undoubtedly pass the
House. I shall not only strongly urge its passage,
but I shall insist that the cable be manufactured in the
United States, and, if possible, in San Francisco.
The prospect for the passage of a bill for the construc
tion of a new Custom-house is most favorable. I
shall continue to labor for the welfare of my city and
my State, and promise you that I shall spare no effort
to secure for San Francisco and California every ad
vantage to which they are entitled."
The quality of Mr. Kahn's work in Congress may
be measured by the character of the appeals he is
making to the voters in the campaign. He is not in
dulging in flights of rhetoric pleasing to the ear but
conveying no message to the brain. On the con
trary, he is, in the language of the street, "talking
business." He knows the needs of the State, he
knows what can be dene at Washington to further
Pacific Coast interests, he knows what measures of
special importance to us are now pending there, and,
moreover, he knows how best to support them.
Mr. Kahn is in every way deserving of the cordial
support thus given him by the business and the work
ing men of his district. During his service at Wash
ington he has devoted himself to the material welfare
of the people of San Francisco, of California and of
the whole Pacific Coast. While he possesses an elo
quence that would easily win for him a brilliant repu
tation in the House as an orator, he has preferred to
make himself known primarily as a worker. Upon
every measure affecting the welfare of his constituents
he has been untiring in his efforts, and despite the fact
that he was a new man in the House and without
piestige or wide acquaintance there, he accomplished
much for the city and the State.
The people of California, it appears, have at last be
gun to understand that fact and have had the intel
ligence to profit by it. Most of the Republican candi
dates for Congress arc men who have had experience
in the House and have been renominated. Abundant
evidence shows that in many cases these men are
going to have not only the Republican but the full
independent vote of their districts. Such is unmis
takably the case in the Fourth District, where the
Hon. Julius Kahn has been renominated. Many
business men have declared an intention to support
him without regard to party, on the simple proposi
tion that he not only stands for the n.aintenance of
existing prosperity, sound money and protection, but
for the business and industrial interests of the whole
State. Looking at the question from the standpoint
of practical men of affairs, they perceiveit would be
folly to defeat a faithful and experienced representa
tive for the mere purpose of making an experiment
with a new man, who is not only tied up to Bryanism
but has had no experience at Washington.
ONE of the most satisfactory characteristics of
recent politicaj developments in California is
the tendency of the people to return to Con
gress men who have been tried in office and proven
themselves worthy. The Call has often preached the
wisdom of that practice. By no other method can
Californians ever hope to attain at the national capi
tal the prestige to which they are rightly entitled. So
long as California constituencies send new men to the
House of Representatives, so long will they have to be
content with a comparatively inefficient representation
there. In all lines of business experience counts for
much, but in none is it more valuable than in the busi
ness of Congressional work. The members who
know the House and the leaders of the House direct
affairs. The new man has to account himself fortu
nnte if he gets an assignment to an important com
mittee in even a subordinate way; a chairmanship i3
cut of the question.
THE RE-ELECTION OF KAHN.
I simply do not believe that the prin
ciples adopted by the last Democratic
National Convention are good Democ-
I do not like the people who talk
about financial ruin and calamity in the
interests of Mr. McKinley any better
than I did the prophets of evil in the
last Presidential campaign who sup
ported Mr. Bryan.
I am, however, not to be numbered
among those who are predicting finan
cial ruin and the destruction of all our
prosperity if a majority of our fellow
citizens should decide to disagree witl^
those of us who hold the views above
expressed and should elect Mr. Bryan
â¢President.
I cannot support the platform or the
candidate of the Democracy this year
without voting against the principles
which I have always advocated in pub
lic life, and I am not willing to remain
neutral or to throw away my vote as I
did before.
Editor San Francisco Call: I have
determined to support Mr. McKinley
for President because the Democratic
party, with which I acted, has adopted
a platform containing the doctrines in
which I do not believe and. has named
as its candidate for President a gentle
man who is to my mind not a Demo
crat.

These are the reasons of an honest man who, hav
ing intelligence to perceive that he has been wrong,
does not permit mere partisan considerations to re
strain him from profiting by the lessons of experience.
There are many workingmen who have changed from
Bryanism for similar reasons, and the explanation of
Mr. Sibley's flop will go far to. account for the indif
ference of the whole people to Bryan's campaign.
Mr. Sibley took a firm stand in favor of t'le up
building of an American merchant marine, and de
clared he could no longer be a member of a party
which opposes every effort in that direction. "When, 1 '
said he. "I sec this nation's products carried to mar
ket under a foreign flag, in foreign ships, manned by
foreign seamen, and to whom we pay two hundred
millions of dollars each year, when the proposition is
made by this administration to build up an American
merchant marine, which shall carry our products to
market in American ships, sailed by American sailors,
and when the committee of which my honored friend
from Ohio. General Grosvenor, is chairman, presents
such a bill in the House of Representatives, and I
have to cither oppose that bill or flop, which do you
think it will be?"
Mr. Sibley went on to point out that what has been
attained is but the earnest of what we may expect
from the continuance of Republican policies. The
statesmanship which opens and secures for us the
avenues to the trade of the Orient will bring marvel
ous rewards to American labor. The demand for
wheat and corn among the Chinese will afford an
ample market for all the wheat the Pacific Coast can
grow, and, as Mr. Sibley said: "The great movement
of wheat from the Red River country in future will
be toward the Orient and not toward Europe. Wheat
being the great staple among agricultural products,
will make the farmer what he once was. and what he
always should be, the king among men."
The orator went on to remind his audience that un
der the Democratic regime sheep brought only about
one dollar in the market, but are now worth from
three to four dollars; that in 1896 -,ve imported from
foreign countries 230.000,000 pounds of wool, while in
1899 we imported but 76,000.000 pounds; that cotton
which sold for four cents under the last administration
brings from nine to ten cents under McKinley; that
farm products generally have advanced from 25 to 125
per cent since the Republican tariff went into effect;
that .wages in nearly all industries have been increased
from 10 to 100 per cent, and in 1899 there were paid
out to wage-earners in this country $769,000,000 more
than were paid out in 1S96: that in his own district
the wages of miners have risen from 40 cents to
80 cents a ton for digging coal, and that wages of
lumbermen had risen from $1 25 to $2 50 a day.
Then he added: "When I see furnaces blazing, forges
glowing, looms weaving; when I hear shuttles click
ing and spindles humming; when brawn and brain
each find fair recompense whether in factory or in
field. I will, as a man who aims to be loyal to his
fellows, his country and his Creator, try my level ba=t
to maintain that condition, call me what you will."
Mr. Sibley did not in any way evade the charge of
changing his opinions. He said frankly: "If looking
at the present and trusting for a grander future,
rather than facing backward to fan the smoldering
embers of the past, constitutes me a flopper, please
enumerate me as one." He then went on to say:
"Whenever I see men who have been working for one
dollar a day able to earn two dollars; when the man
who earned two dollars can have the opportunity to
ci-rn three, I will flop as often as it may be necessary
to help that condition for that man to continue.
When from 1893 to 1896 47 per cent of the wage
carncrs of this country were unemployed or working
on short hours, and to-day only three-eighths of one
per cent of the wage-earners are unemployed, I will
flop to help keep these men employed, whenever and
wherever it is demanded. When under a free trade
tariff bill we saw our nation largely importing its
manufactured necessities, and when under this admin
istration we are manufacturing not only for ourselves
but are supplying the other nations of the world with
the products fabricated by American hands in Ameri
can workshops, you can make a fair guess that I will
flop to help that cause along. Last year we sent from
our American workshops to foreign nations $330,000,
000 worth of manufactured products, this year $432,
000,000; and with the assured certainty that with the
present policy maintained these exports will within
six years reach more than $1,000,000,000 annually,
thereby requiring double the workshops of the present
and affording double the present opportunity for hon
est labor and honest capital to meet with substantial
recompense, I will flop, and flop until I can be right
side up in line with that policy."
WHEN the Hon. Joseph C. Sibley of Pennsyl
vania, who was elected as a Democrat to Con
gress, denounced Bryanism, declared his con
version to "Republicanism and accepted the Republi
can nomination for Congress he was charged with
being a "flopper." That charge he met in a recent
speech to his constituents, giving reasons for his
change and at the same time showing good cause why
thousands of others should flop with him.
WHY SIBLEY FLOPPED.
Bryan's fashion of garbling statements from Lin
coln is crude compared with Stevenson's method. In
fact the latter opens up a new field for enterprising
reformers. They can get spirits of all the immortal
dead to come up and furnish prophetic warnings of
dangers ahead. Adlai has made the ten strike of the
campaign.
Lincoln, had ever found them in his writings, and Mr.
Hay says there is nothing like them in any speech or
utterance of Mr. Lincoln. But Mr. Hay had heard
of them. His first acquaintance with this "prophecy"
published by Mr. Stevenson was in 1898, when it was
"announced" by a traveling spiritualist named Cora
Hatch, who gave it as a message received by her
while in communication with the spirit of Lincoln,!

NEW YORK SUNâ If the Southern
States are disposed to treat illiteracy as
a disqualification for the franchise there
is nothing in the constitution to prevent
them from doing it: but the discrimina
tion of the "grandfather clause" is plainlv
unconstitutional, for it is against a single
race. Moreover, the fourteenth amend
ment subjects the disfranchising State tr.
a proportionate diminution of Its baÂ«is o'
representation; and eventually the other
States will compel the enforcement of th-^
provision, in order to secure their proper
relative power under the constitution.
ATLANTA CONSTITUTIONâ The ques
tion of education Is no longer debatable
so far as we^are concerned. The States
of the North and West have magnificently
endowed institutions of public character,
not to speak of the $1LO,(V)0,000 invested In
other institutions of learning. We are
thrown into competition with such people
as these, and if we do not make an effort
to keep up with thÂ© procession nothing
is more certain than that our children
will become the serfs of those of other
States.
NEW YORK TRIBUNEâ What would
John Bright say if he could come back to
Birmingham, always solidly Liberal in h?3
time, when its workingmen had no votes
to cast, and find that with full manhood
suffrage every Birmingham M. â¢ P. is a
Tory and elected on a jingo war cry at
that? John Bright's firmest conviction
was that whenever the plain people were
allowed to vote British wars of conquest
and annexation would become impossible.
CHICAGO TRIBUNEâ Mr. Bryan
should not expect a renomination if he
leads Us party to defeat again. Tt.ere Is
no precedent for the bestowal of a third
nomination on a man who ha* twice been
unsuccessful. The conservative people of
the United Statesâ Democrats as well as
Republicansâ would feel easier In mind ify
they were sure that Mr. Bryan did rrct
intend to make a precedent and force his
party to sacrifice Itself a third time on
the altar of his Immoderate ambition.

NEW YORK HERALDâ The curious

tain Milton's fame is not confined to his
heroic actions at Fairbank. As a hunter

has come to San Francisco to accept a lu
crative position with Wells. Fargo & Co.,
for whom he was acting as messenger at
the time of the Fairbank hold-up.
Unlike most men whose deeds have
brought them fame, the captain does not
court notoriety. He prefers to go about
his business forgetful of the paxt, and
unless drawn off-hand Into a reminiscent
mood he never speaks of his triumphs.
Captain SJilton has Just returned from

witness in the trial of the Fairbank des

they Jogged along on their horses Milton
ppicd a monster panther crouching in a
small canyon to their left. The captain's
ririe was at his shoulder In an Instant.
Crack! Then followed a blood-curdling
cry. The next moment the enraged beast
was in the air. Although struck by the
bullet, the wound was not fatal, and the
animal had sprung for its assailant.
Again the captain llred, the bullet tear
ing an ugly wound in the animal's fore
foot. The panther fell close beBide the

THE naval reserve steamer Marlon
nearly lost her launch Wednes
day night. White on her way
from Folsom-street whai< to the
sloop-of-war a floating pile was run
Into The launch broached to, and
the propeller, striking the log, was
broken off short.
With her propeller gone the launch
began to drift down the bay and the
men aboard at once used all the spare
steam In sounding 'an alarm. It waa
heard aboard the Coast and Geodetic
Survey steamer Pathfinder, and a
launch was sent to the assistance of
the shipwrecked mariners.
The Pathfinder uses vapor launches
and It was owing to the fact that
Chief Officer Dutton wÂ«s on deck and
ordered the launch lowered away at
once, and that it onlv took about a
minute to get ' steam, that tho
Marion's boys did not have to spend a
night on the bay.
THE British bark Inverurla
arrived from Swansea yester
day after a racher long run
of 13S days. This craft
seems always to make port with
a story. On her first visit to this
port, about ten years ago, she came in
HJ^h her flap at half mast. A doctor,
absconding from his creditors, taking
a servant girl along with him and
leaving hln wife and children behind,
was a passenger. In return for a pas-
Eage he was to take care of the cap
tain's wife during her confinement.
The mother and baby died.
Yesterday the Inverurle came Into
port apaln with her flag at half mast.
During the voyage there had been
three deaths at sea and when Dr.
Klnyoun went aboard he ordered the
vessel Into quarantine. â¢ There is
bubonic plague in England and the
deaths may have been from that dread
disease or It may have been rfcurvy.
THE Britleh ship S^rlnRburn had
a rough time of It coming around
the Horn. She was 162 days out
from London and there 13 not one
of the crÂ«w wh* is not glad to be here.
On August 15 *he vas on her bÂ«am
ends. The mizzen topgallant yard
came down with a crash, several sails
blpw out of the holt roprs, and the
pressure being thus relieved, the ship
got on an even keel again. It Â¦was
an exciting moment, however.
On October 10, In latitude 36 degrees
north, longitude 127 degrees west, the
Springburn spoke the American ship
Aryan, from New Tork to Son Kran
ripco. She was probably In the game
pale that nearly wrecked the Spring
burn, as the captain reported that "off
the Horn" the boatswain and two men
had been washed overboard. The Ar
yan, with her story of disaster, will
probably reajch port to-day.

but a relapse set in and the heroic action
proved of no avail. The attorney's mother,
brothers and sisters were at his bedside
when the end came.
The deceased was born in the mountains
of i-ios Angeles County in 1837. His earlier
education was had in the schools of the

FATHER YORKE TO SPEAK
IN AID OF ST. PETER'S
"They prefer the Australian rabbit fur.
In the first place," said Mr. Waldeck to
an inquirer, "because they found the fur
to be better. They would pay only 10
cents per pound for California jackrab
bit skins properly prepared for their use.
When you figure out the cost of ammuni
tion, freight, payinp men for killing the
rabbits and also count in the work needed
to make the skins ready. for market, you
will see that there is no money in it." If
there were a concern to treat and handle
the jnckrabbit fur I think there would
be some profit in the business, but there
Is none now."
Mr. Waldeck tried out the entire prob
lem thoroughly. He sent rabbit sklni,
prepared with care, to St. Louis, Chicago
and New York, where they were Inspect
ed. Considering the vast number of Jack
rabbits, it was fair to suppose that the
pest was likely to become a source of
considerable rnnual revenue to the State.
But the Eastern handlers of fur, after a
Ions time, have concluded that they will
not pay enough for Jackrabbit skins with
ihe fur on to make it profitable to cure
and forward the skins from California.
Trade conditions have upset another
fond tradition and the nursery rhyme that
provides "A little rabbit skin to wrap the
Baby Bunting In" must be revised In the
interest of accuracy. Local dealers in
furs, who have been interested In making
a market in the East for the fur of the
California "bunny," or jackrabblt, have
finally concluded that there ia no money
in the undertaking. This was announced
yesterday by Herman Waldeck, who more
than any other has sought a new field of
usefulness for the jackrabbit.
This will be a distinct disappointment to
the people of the San Joaquin Valley and
other sections where the rabbits are so
numerous that they are annually killed
by thousands In drives. Many of the
dwellers in the interior have killed rab
bits ae a basis for the market experiment,"
and the correspondence interchanged has
been enough in volume and varied enough
in informational value to make up a fair
Jackrabblt literature.
Waldeck Finally Abandons the Hope
of Turning a State Pest Into
a Large Source of Rev
enue.

cancies to fill bofi.re- starting for the East,
among them being ;i preMdin,; eld^r to

After this gathering the Bishop will at
tend me*'tir.jcs of the general committees
of the Method! =t denomination, fo that he
will not return to this c!ty before Decem
ber. At that time he expects to move
into his new horr.e on Bucbanan street,
which is now being remodeled.
The Bishop Is much encouraped with
the progress that Is beinpr marto by th?
Methodist oh'in-hes of the West. The
field Is a larpco one, but the various con
ferences appeal alive to the opportunities,
and hralthy prowth Is reported In almost
every section.
To the Bishop one of the most Interest-
Ing Incidents of his trip was the fart that
each one cf his appointees voluntarily re
quested the College of Bishops to return
him another year, so pleased were they
with his work of conducting the confer
ences.
Bishop J. tV. Hamilton returned to this
city yesterday afternoon after an absence
of six weeks. During his trip the Bishop
held eight cor.ferpncps for six successive
weeks, beginning in Nevsda and ending In
Arizona: He has in that time appointed

Medicines.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are a discov-
ery of great value to the medical profes-
sion and the public. They are an unfail-
ing specific in all cases of dyspepsia and
disordered digestion.
Almost everybody's digestion is dis-
ordered more or less, and the commonest
thing they do for It Is to take some one
of the many so-called blood purifiers,
which in many cases are merely strong
cathartics. Such things are not needed.
If the organs are In a clogged condition,
they need only a little help and they will
right themselves. Cathartics Irritate the
sensitive linings of the stomach and
bowels and often do more harm than
good.
Purging Is not what Is needed. The
thing to do is to put the food in con-
dition to be readily digested and assimi-
lated. Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets do
this perfectly. They partly digest what
is eaten and give tre stomach just the
help It needs. They stimulate the secre-
tion and excretion of the digestive fluids
and relieve the congested condition of the
glands and membranes. They put the
whole digestive system In condition to do
Its work. When that Is done you need
take no more tablets, unless you eat what
does not agree with you. Then take one
or two tabletsâ give them needed help and
you will have no trouble.
It's a common-sense medicine arid a com-
mon-sense treatment and it will cure
every time. Not only cure the disease,
but cure the cause. Goes about it In a
perfectly sensible and scientific way.
We have testimonials enough to fill a
book, but we don't publish many of them.
Mrs. E- M. Faith of Ryrds Creek. Wis..
says- I have taken all the Tablets I got
of vou and they have done their work well
in-my case, for I feel like a different person
altogether. I don't doubt If I had not got
them I should have been at rest by this
H E. Wlllard. Onslow, Iowa. Bays: Mr.
White of Canton was telllngr me of your
Dyspepsia Tablets curing him of dyspep-
sia from which he had suffered for eight
years. As I am a sufferer myself, I wish
you to send me a package by return mall.
Phil Brooks, Detroit. Mich., says: Your
dyspepsia cure has worked wonders in my
case. I suffered for years from dyspepsia,
but am now entirely cured and enjoy life
as I never have before. I gladly recom-
mend them.
It will cost 50 cents to find out just how
much Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets will
help you. Try themâ that's the best way
to decide.

on stomach diseases will be mailed free

ST. BRIGUyS FAIR
IS WELL PATRONIZED
Next Tuesday a Promenade Concert
and High Tea Will Be
Given.
The business of St. Brlgld's fair went on
merrily last night. All the attractions of
the booths were well patronized. The
palmist. Ztnfreda, was kept busy with her
marvelous reading of hands and those
who consulted her were filled with ad
miration.
Mrs. James Shea., who Is an auxiliary
of the gazette booth, pave a lunch party
yesterday at the refreshment booth. The
raffles will come off on Monday and all
articles remaining at the booths will be
auctioned off Tuesday. On that day the
promenade concert and high tea will take
place. Arrangements to provide a de
lightful repast for the occasion have been
made. The ladies of the fair trust that
the farewell entertainment will be well
patronized.
Eight couples of fistic entertainers per
formed last night at the Initial entertain
ment of the Bay City Amateur Athletic
Club, and they made the inauguration a
success. Although but a single knock
out and not very much of the flowing red
marked the lighting everybody was satis
fied with everything except the decision
in the last fight, which should have gone
to Dan Barry.
This last fight, Barry vs. Daily, was the
event of the evening on the cards, but It
was clearly overstepped In point of clev
erness by the contest between Fred Bell
and Jim Eagan, who fought half way
through thÂ» fourth round when Bell fell
from exhaustion.
Eagan and Bell mingled fists scientific
ally and pleased the crowd by their clever
listic work. In the fourth round Bell's
store of vitality was exhausted and he
fell limp and battle-stained to the ground.
The last contest showed I>an Barry in
good form. He did most of the leading
and went to his man, Jim Dally, as if he
wanted to force dire distress upon him,
but the referee, J. McDevitt, reading the
decision of the judges, said It was a draw.
Joe Sullivan received a decision from
Hugh Garrlty after four rounds of care
ful fighting. Dick Collins did not like lit
tle Abe Audi's stiff punches and was
counted out by the referee because he
stayed down several seconds without be
ing hit. Alex Hart, who tried the mettle
of George Watson, felt the same way In
the fourth round, and his disinclination to
fight on his feet made the latter the win
ner.
An extra round was called for in thÂ©
fight between Jim Little and Tom Woods.
After It was all over the referee an
nounced a draw. Woods did good work
-for a novice.
Gus Salsbury and Tim Hurst furnished
the burlesque. Hurst's grotesque style
made him a short-ender, but Before the
fight was completed he had friends and
half, the money. The fight was a draw.

JUDGE CABANISS' courtroom was
crowded yesterday when the pre
liminary examination of the boy
Albert Loux. charged with the mur
<?er of Daniel Harney, the newsboy,
was held. The boy sat beside his attor
ney, Abraham Ruef. and listened calmly
to the testimony ,-jiven by the boy wit
nesses for the prosecution end defense.
1 he Judge after patiently hearing all the
evidence held Lcux to answer before the
Superior Court on a charge of man
slaughter and fixed his bonds in $200a It
was made apparent from the questions of
Attorney Ruef that he will plead self
defense in the upper court and incident
ally that Harney did not die from tho
knife wound In his abdomen, but from
blood poisoning.
- The first witness called was Mrs. Cath
erine Harney, mother of the murdered
boy. She testified that she lived at 1107
Mason street and was the mother of Dan
iel Harney, who at the time of his death
was 17 years 9 months old and tall and
strong for his age. She Identified the
shirt and trousers marked with blood as
havinr been worn by him on September 2,
the day he was stabbed.
I>r. Jonathan Green, 1229 Taylor street,
testified that he attended Daniel Harney
on the evening of September 2. The boy
had been stabbed in the abdomen. The
physician pushed two of his fingers Into
the wound to feel if the Intestines were
cut, but found that they were not- He
advised that the boy should be sent to
St. Mary's Hospital, where he attended
him. The wound was stitched and
dressed and blood poisoning set in. It
was decided to perform an operation, but
Harney strike Loux and Harney say that
he was cut.
For the defense Henry David testified
that he was going with his family to a
concert and saw the boys fighting. He
saw the Harney boy striking a smaller
boy and he said to him that he should not
strike a boy smaller than himself. Au
gust Loux. a brother of the defendant,
testified that Harney punched him, the
witness, who fell down and when he got:
up he ran to the middle of the street, fol
lowed by Harney, who hit him again
twice and he fell down each time. Then
Harney said he was stabbed. The wit
ness did not see a knife. Joseph Pac
clocco, another boy, testified practically
to the same effect. The defendant also
testified to Harney striking him several
times. He had the knife In his hand,
cutting his shoestring, when Harney
broke from the crowd and ran at him
and he supposed he must have ran
against the knife.
It was found that the boy was in such a
depressed state that he could not stand it.
The boy died from peritonitis. In cross
examination ho testified that the wound
In the abdomen was not of Itself fatal,
but blood poisoning set in, caused by some
foreign substance probably on the knife.
Charles Harnuy. a younger brother of
tho dead boy, testified that he had a fight
with Loux and he went and told his
brother Daniel, who had gone to his
aunt's house on Clay and Mason streets.
Daniel went to Loux, who was sitting on.
the steps of a house, and asked him;
"What did you strike my brother for?"
Loux smiled and rose to his feet, and
Daniel struck him on the face. Loux ran
to the middle of the street and Daniel fol
lowed him. A man told Daniel he should
not strike a smaller boy than himself,
and there was a mix-up. Ernest Monter
chard held Daniel's arms and Loux
punched Daniel on the stomach. Daniel
said he had been stabbed and walked to
a drug store. â¢ He Identified the knife, as
Loux had loaned It to him earlier in the
day to cut a piece out of his shoe.
The knife was also identified by Tom
Meagher and Leon Simpson, two boys,
who found It at the scene of the mix-up
the following morning. It Was open when
they found It and there was a dirty red
mark on the blade, which they thought
was blood.
Ernest Monterchard testified that
every time Loux fell Harney lifted him
up till Loux ran to get away from Har
ney. Witness held Harney and told him
to leave Loux alone, as he had beaten
him enoug-h. Harney punched Loux
twice, then witness held Harney's arms
behind his back and after he let g-o his
arms he heard Harney say that he was
stabbed. Eddie Sullivan, Joseph Mc-
Intyre. William Lloyd, John Podesto and

Knocking a Married Woman
Down Four Times.
Oscar B. Mlnsel appeared before Judge
Conlan yesterday on a charge of battery
upon Mrs. Minnie Hergoth, 534^ Bryant

Herg-oth went to a saloon near her resi
dence for her husband on October S and
Minsel followed them and knocked Mrs.
Hergoth down, striking: her In the face

defendant than to the prosecution and he
was satisfied no jury would convict tho
defendant.
Harry Walters, the well-known bunko
man. grinned as he left Judge Fritz's
court yesterday afternoon. He was
charged Â¦with petty larceny by trick and
device for making Lorenzo Snow of Sail

P. Rellly's Lady Grar.ard was easily the
best dog In the midweek reserve stake
yesterday at Union Park. From her first
siip to the raising of the flag in the de
ciding course it was> a euccesslon of well
earned and decisive victories, the Lady
leading her opponents in. every course^
The winner 5s by Emln Pasha, out of
Wave, and is a full eister of Sisquoc. Her
exhibition of s^peed and cleverness cer
tainly Â«howed her line breeding. In the
Jirst round she von an easy decision from
George 6harn:ans The Doctor. The talent
went wrong 0:1 this event, griotinjj 5 to 3

.another killing for iht plners, inis time

Lauy Oranard was retired some time
ago on account of indifferent work, and
her pre;-ei;i spienciid showing came as a
surprise.
Uolc Nugget, Pasha kennels' importa
tion, showed wonderful improvement and
reached tr.'S fifth round, where she went
out to the winner. Her performance
entitles her to great credit, as every
course she ran wi^s a hard working one
and severe enough to test the staying
qualities of any hound. Twenty short ends
showed during the stake at average fair
odds.
Jir.gle Bells, the runner-up, did clever
work. ]n the final it was hard for her to
oft^tt the determined Lady Granard. who
led her from the slips A hard go with
Frosty Morn in the tilth hurt her chances.
The ail-absorbing topic among the leash
men is the big event for Saturday and
Sunday next. Ueacon and Luxor are not
favored to the extent that was predicted
earlier. PaJo Aito. while considered a fac
tcr. is really In the doubtful list, and the
Â¦wise ones are more at ease in predicting
reasons for his defeat than picking- him
*f a winner. Sir i'asha is more in demand
as the time for the tig stake approaches,
ikying Fox. too. has many admirers, who
figure- him as the best stake entry of the
Curtis kennel. ll<Â»d Angus was 'given a

I S LADY GRANARD
Looking hale and hearty James F. Cald
well, the noted starter, accompanied by
his family, arrived In the city last night
from New York. He is registere4 at tho
Palace Hotel. Since leaving California at
the close of the last racing season Mr.
Caldwell has officiated in the starter's box
at Latonia, Newport and Saratoga tracks,
where his splendid work was highly
praised. The silver-haired "prince of
starters" will handle the red bunting at
Oakland the coming season, a fact which
prevented him from accepting a return
engagement at Latonia, the meeting at
that track not opening this year until
October 27.
To-morrow night Mr. Caldwell will leave
for Los Angeles, at which point he will
dispatch the runners during the coining
meeting to be held thero. The fields will
be sent away with the flag, a gate not
being available.
Reviewing the Eastern racing situation
the veteran flag wlelder said Saratoga en-
Joyed a highly successful season this year,
but that If suitable dates could not be
obtained for next season Walbaum, who
is again a man of means, would probably
dispose of his property at the springs.
Forty-eight bookmakers chalked up odds
there. Caldwell further stated that the
approaching season here Is engrossing
much attention among Eastern horsemen
and bookmakers, and that Sam Hildreth's
preat stable is pretty sure to have a
strong fe'lowing of Easterners in its
wake. Green Morris and several other
owners of big strings are also getting
ready to ship this way.
The stables of Pat Dunne, Andy Blake
ley, C. F. Saunders & Co. and Fenton &
Co. arrived, at Oakland track yesterday
from Chicago.

CALDWELL HERE
FROM THE EAST
The social science department, under the
chairmanship of Mrs. Arthur Cornwall, is
preparing for an active philanthropic
campaign the coming year.
Frances Graham, whose glorious con
tralto voice has won her so much admira
tion since she has been a star of the Tlv
oli's fine combination, goes East soon to
take the leading contralto position In
Grau's grand opera troupe. In private life
the singer is most womanly and charming,
and quite In keeping with her iovely char
acter is her generous gift of her talent for
this vaudeville matinee.
It is not generally realized how such
women work for a cause which brings no
personal emolument to them. Professional
people learn to do things by routine, but
women of leisure In projecting and carry
ing out such an Important project as the
vaudeville matinee of the 23d lnst. relin
quish leisure, comfort, pleasure and re
pose to give their whole strength toward
accomplishing success.
Many attractive features are belner
added to the original plan. The ladies of
the hospital section of the social science
department will act as a reception com
mittee. Trained nurses from the City and
County Hospital, where much good work
has been done by the club, will be present
in their neat uniforms and distribute the
souvenir programmes, and the entertain
ment that will be offered has been en
riched by late additions which will be kept
as a surprise.
So, now, artists, advertisers, Orpheum
management, vendors of all sorts of ne
cessities In the way of lights, music, etc.,
lend their aid graciously and gratuitously,
while the business and social worlds â the
people who love the artistic and the
charming, and the many who lazily love
to do their good works by proxyâ are buy-
Ing seats and boxes with a promptness
that tills the hearts of the members of the
club with joy.
Tho ladies of the social science depart
ment of the California Club, who are the
active workers in the preparations for the
matinee to be given Tuesday afternoon at
the Orpheum, and who are being sup
ported by the entire membership of the
club, are Justifiably proud of the generous
co-operation extended to them on very
hand. The good record of this club in suc
cessful work for the municipality, whether
educational, philanthropic or civic, stands
it in good stead when it comes forward aS
an aspirant for patronage which shall
bring money into its coffers for the many
branches ot the good work it carries on.

When Marston recovers he will visit
Redwood City and endeavor to identify
the suspect, who is being held.
When asked how he had received the
Â¦wound O'Brien said he had been acciden
tally shot while hunting. Suspecting that
the man had been shot while committing
some depredation the doctor lost no time
in communicating with the authorities.
O'Brien was then subjected to a rigid
cross-examination, and as he frequently
contradicted himself It was decided to
look up his history pending an .investiga
tion.
The police are inclined to believe that

Waddell was put in the box as a forlorn
hope, but the Â¦ handicap was too great.
McGinnlty won his second game in the
series by keeping the hits well scattered
and by receiving the finest support. Cross

way of numerous balls speeding toward

hotel. The team by unanimous consent

personal property forever.
The Brooklyn management save McGln
nity $100 extra for his good work.
The Pittsburg men went at their work
to-day with determination and every
point was well covered up to the fourth
inning, when a fumble by Leever netted
Brooklyn three runq. After that the lo

they played hard to win it was conceded
by the spectators that the home team was
outclassed.

National Banks Agree to Pay Taxes
Amounting to $60,000 on

AfscFsor Dodge said yesterday that the
national banks of this city -have agreed
to pay the taxes on their stock and that
the city's excess revenue will in conse
quence he increased by 5G0.O00 over and
above the $200,000 Increase heretofore esti
mated.
Dodjre pays that in his estimate of the
amount on which It was certain that
taxfs would be collected he made an al
lowance of about $10,000,000 from the tax
roll that would be involved in litigation.
This amount included about $6,000,000, the
assessment made against the Ptock of na
tional hanks. The surplus revenue was
etimated by Dodge at about $200,000: this
amount being the taxes in excess of the
tax rcll over and above the $375,000,000 on
which the tax rate was fixed by the
Board of Supervisors in July last. As this
$0,000.0'*) was not taken into account, it
now appears that the surplus of the city
will amount to nearly $300,000 instead of
$200,009 as at nVet estimated.

The Beard of Election Commissioners
met yesterday afternoon and decided to
place the ordinance licensing the sell-
I ing of pools on contests between men
on the State ticket which will be voted for
at the next election. This action is the
result of a monster petition signed by
20.TPS voters requesting the submission of
the ordinance to legalize gambling to a
vote of the people.
Registrar WalFh sated that it would he
impossible to secure in time the necessary
paper to print the ordinance on a sepa
rate ticket. Though convinced that the
procedure was not entirely regular, the
commission decided to place the ordinance
on the State ticket as a matter of expe
diency.
This will in all likelihood permit the
opponents of poolrooms to test the legal
ity of the proposed measure by raising
the issue that a municipal matter should
not be voted for at the same time as State
officials.

MAP SHOWING POLITICAL. DI
VISIONS OF EUROPE AT END
OF SIXTEENTH CENTURY.
Crossing the Alps In our survey, we find
that 200 years ago Italy, like Germany,
was merely "a geographical expression."
Equally disrupted, without even a formal
tie like the empire. It was even more ex
posed to the aggrandizement of Spain.
France or Austria. The southern half of
the peninsula, commonly called the king
dom of Naples, the islands of Sicily and
Sardinia and the duchy of Milan belonged
Turning now to the two German states
whose rivalry has played so large a part
in the military history of these centuries
âAustria and Prussiaâ we find that the
margrave of Brandenburg has just risen
to the dignity of a king (1701). taking his
title from the territory of Prussia, whose
sovereignty had been wrested from Po
land by his father. The policy of the
new king was to continue the efforts of
the great electorâ to unify and consolidate
his detached possessions by absorbing tho
territories lying between them and by
substituting for various local bodies a
centralized and energetic administration.
The accomplishment of this task was con
stantly promoted hardly less by the wise
policy of internal improvements and gen
erous hospitality to religious refugees
than by the army. With a population
mainly homogeneous and Protestant, the
problem of Prussia was easier than that
of her rival, for the Austrian possessions
were a loose aggregation of states, inhab
ited by several races speaking nearly a
dozen distinct Â¦ languages. Notwithstand
ing the already heterogeneous character
of their domains, the house of Hapsburg
aimed -constantly to extend Its rule, and
did so at the expense of Spain in Italy and
the Netherlands and at the expense of
the Turk in the southeast.
The nominal sovereign of the empire
was the emperor. This office of emperor,
as a matter of form, was bestowed by
election by the great princes of the em
pire, who constituted the electoral col
lege. As a matter of fact. It was usually
hereditary in the house of Austria, Sev
eral of the great princes of the empire
bore a curious double relation to It. In
volving at times a serious conflict of ln
terests^Jtpr example, the archduke of
Austria wW usually emperor (not, as id
too often supposed, of Austria, but of the
Holy Roman Empire of the German na
tion), and at the same time as king of
Bohemia he was one of the imperial elect
ors. Inside the empire he was also after
1715 ruler of the Austrian Netherlands
(approximately modern Belgium), and
outside the empire king of Hungary, duke
of Milan, etc. Again, the. margrave of
Brandenburg was an electoral prince In
the empire, while outside of it he was
king of Prussia, duke of Silesia (after
1742), etc.* The duke of Brunswick-Lune
burg was made an imperial elector In
1602, being commonly called the elector of
Hanover. In 1714 the elector of Hanover
became the king of England. . .
riority, the unification of Germany and of
Italy and the rise of Russia as a Euro
pean and world power that are the great
est changes wrought In Europe since 1700.
One of the first reauisites for under
standing the European situation at this
date is a Knowledge of the peculiar make
up of the old Germanic empire. Without
such knowledge, too, the rise of Prussia,
the work of Napoleon and the formation
of the German empire of to-day cannot
be clearly grasped. In the eighteenth cen
tury the Germanic or Holy Roman em
pire was a loosely connected federation
of some 360 sovereign or nearly sovereign
states, consisting of principalities and re
publics and comprising in all somewhat
lerfs than four times the area of Illinois
and somewhat over 20.000.COO of people. Of
the local and petty character of the ma
jority of these states in tho empire one
gets an idea from the fact that the sixty
odd imperial cities, (city republics) pos
sessed little territory outside their walls,
and that there were eighty of the sover
eign states with less than 200 square
miles of area; or, to state the same fact
differently, more than a quarter of the
empire was occupied by sta.tes no one of
which was as large as Delaware. An In
teresting survival of these little states is
the present principality of Lichtenstein.
These little states could form alliances
with each other or with foreign nations
provided they were not against the em
pire or the public peace, a provision con
tinually defied. With the exception of the
free or Imperial cities, which were repub
lics, these minor states were absolute
monarchies, whose princes maintained a
court life modeled on that at Versailles.
In the ecclesiastical states, those whose
rulers were bishops, the religious element
was conspicuous- only in that in the pa
rade of state monks took the place of sol
diers. Next to be mentioned are the sev
eral hundred knights of the empire, ruling,
except as regards war and treaties, do
mains on the average of about 400 Inhab
itants.
and all European monarehs had their eyes
on him, for any Increase in hi3 power or
resources might made him more powerful
than any practical combination against
him. In the middle of his reign France
reached a position from which she domi
nated European culture and threatened to
dominate European politics. In the self
defensive effort of other states to check
the expansion -of France and to curb the
ambition of Louis XIV, William, Prince
of Orange, the ruler of the Netherlands,
took the lead. His accession ta the Eng
lish throne In 16S8 had immensely
strengthened his position strategically,
for he exchanged an exposed for a pro
tected position, and he was insured the
support of English resources In the strug
gle as long as Louis favored the exiled
Stuart?. As ruler of both the United
Netherlands and England he headed the
opposition cf the two great maritime pow
ers to the aims of Louis \iV. to secure
to France through the accession of his
grandson to the. throne of Spain a share
in the control of the Mediterranean and
Spanish-American trade.
A word. In closing, of the significance of
the balance of power. Early In the six
teenth century, Dy a succession of fortu
nate marriaees and the imperial election
of 1519, Charles V found himself Emperor
cf the Holy Roman empire, tho ruler of
the Hapsburg hereditary domains, of the
of a large part of Italy, and
Kins of Spain and of the Indies. Thl.i
truly formidable combination threatened
the Independence of the rest of Europe,
but the Protestant revolution was th.-s
force of disruption, -which, in Junction
with the self-defensive alliances of the
smaller states, prevented either Charles
or his son Philip II from perfecting their
vast designs tch" universal monarchy.
Similarly, in Louis XIV's tlma thÂ« pro
jected union of Spain and FrancÂ© brought
Into existence a succession of alliances
to defeat the ambition of the great king.
Again, the designs of Napoteon were met
by the allied powers, and in our own day
the trip'Â© alliance of Germany, Austria
and Italy has been confronted with tho
understanding of France and Russia. In
Fhort. the preservation of the balance of
power was the maintenance of such an
equilibrium that no one power or com
bination of powers should be suffered to
prow to such a size as to bear dowii on
the teeterboard of European politics any
available combination of the remaining
states. The effort to maintain thl3 equ
llbrlum ultimately worked out to the ad
vantage of the strong. As long as there
were groups of small states like the em
pire of Italy or disorganized and helplepa
large states like Poland they were men
aced by absorption or dismemberment by
their stronger neighbors in their cease
less rivalry. The interests of states and
rulers were merged and a disputed suc
cession Involved not merely a contest be
tween rival factions, like the "Wars of the
Roses in England, but great international
wars whose consequences profoundly Inr
fluenced European history and were felt
around the globe.

The Mail Company's steamer City of
Peking artived from the Orient yesterday
morning and was quarantined. The cabin
passengers were released and later the
vessel was allowed to dock. Â»Those in the
cabin were:

is to visit all the customs stations on the

home in time for the election.

She was to leave the next day for Nome",
where she was to take aboard about 1000
destitute miners who want to get to civil
ization. It would take her a week to get
to the gold fields and load, so she should
reach Seattle about the 22d inst.
Nome.
THE LAWTON HEAIID FROM.
Probably on Her Way Home From
During the run home the Pathfinder's
crew took three deep-sea soundings. The
best one was in latitude 40 deg. 3 mln.
north, longitude 128 dog. 32 mln. west, or
nearly off San Francisco. The plummet
went down 2530 fathoms, a little less than
three miles.
All the triangulatlons were made by
Assistant H. F. Flynn, who was in charge
of the steamer Yukon (75 tons). The rest
of the work was done on the launch Delta
and the ship's two launches and a char
tered boat. Flynn did some splendid work
crossing the tundra and 'mountains be
tween St. Michael and Golovin Bay on
foot and making the most accurate kinds
of observations. The work done by all
hands on the Pathfinder will not be over
looked at Washington.
At the outset the crew of the Pathfinder
ran up against a snag. Captain Gilbert
did not know that smallpox was "epi
demic" at Nome and that Egg Island had
been established as a quarantine station.
He went ashore on the Island and put up
a signal pole. Lieutenant Cantrell
swooped down on the party and ordered
the Pathnnder into quarantine. Captain
Gilbert simply hove up anchor and went
to work with his triangulatlons further
up the sound.
The officers of the Pathfinder are: Cap
tain J. J. Gilbert. H. V. Flynn. U. S. M.
C. and coast and geodetic survey; A. H.
Dutton, cnicf officer; C. W. Fitzgerald,
second officer; W. M. Atkinson, third of
ficer; John T. Goldsborough, chief engi
neer; Dr. J. J. Murphy, surgeon; E. R,
Krisbie, aid, and C. F. Deiehmann, pay
master. Of these gentlemen Captain Gil
bert ?ays: "I never served with a more
courteous or more able set of men in my
life."
The coast survey steamer Patterson has
been operating between Golofnln Bay and
Port Clarence, and the chances are that
when the maps produced by the experts
on both boats are published the whole
coast line cf Alaska will be changed.
"From the time we left Puget Sound
until we got back to San Francisco I
never saw a vessel play in such luck.
"When we expected rainy weather It was
like a morning- in June; when the north
westers should have been howling it was
fair weather and a clear sky; when we
should have been in the region of fog
there was a chance to take an observation
every hour In the day. 1 guess the Presi
dent's good wishes have followed the
Bhip."
Incidentally the surveys of the Path
finder and Patterson will change all the
maps of the coast line of Alaska, The
topographical, hydrographical and trlgo
nomicai surveys of the coast from St.
Michael to Golofnln Bay show that Tol
ston Point has gone; that Unalakllk is
milts inland; that the reindeer station at
Cape Denbigh is away out at sea and that
there is no bay as shown by the present
chart; that Golofnin Bay is only one-third
tho size shown on the chart and that one
half of that one-third only carries a foot
of water; that some of the rivers are
merely sloughs, and that many of the
headlands ha\e disapptared or never ex
isted.
THE United States Coast and Geo
detic Survey steamer Pathfinder
has lest about half her crew. Un
der her old rating sh'e ranked as
belonging to the navy and every
man aboard was under naval rules and
regulations. Now all hands come under
the rules and regulations of the coast and
geodetic survey and about one-half the
crew has taken the opportunity to leave
the ship. Some four cr five of the boys
the officers would like to have kept, but
the remainder went over the side with a
thought following them that resembled
"good riddance."
Men to fill the vacancies will be secured
to-day, and inside of a week the Path
finder will be ready for sea again.
When the Pathnnder was launched, in
December, 1S9S, Secretary Gage was pres
ent and President McKinley wired him
from the White House, "Best wishes for
the Pathfinder and for a successful
launching." That telegram is now framed
and forms the only ornament in Captain
J. J. Gilbert's cabin.
"The President's grood wishes have fol
lowed the ship from the Atlantic to the
Pacific," said Captain Gilbert yesterday.
'â¢1 was president of the trial board and
never saw a vessel do better 'than the
Pathnnder. Captain F. W. Perkins took
her on her maiden cruise, and when he
was ordered to Manila I came across the
continent and took charge at. Seattle.

SITATE A NEW MAP OF ALASKA.
Judge Pur.r.e was confronted with a
Valky jury yesterday. James M. Blanch
ard was placed on trial at the opening of
the morning session on a charge of em
tczz'.eisent. The evidence proved that he
had taken two gold watches, two gold
chains and two diamond lockets from W^
X. Vanderslice & Co. for the alleged pur
7>osÂ« of exhibiting them to representa
tives cf a society which intended present
ing them to officers of the same. Instead
of this. Elanchard pawned the watches
for S05 50. -
No demand for the return of the
tvatches or their equivalent In coin was
maie by the jewelry company, but
Blanch a rd was arrested and charged with
embezzlement. Judge Dunne instructed
that as no demand for the return of the
Â¦watches had been made before Blanch
nrd's arrest he could not be convicted of
fmbezzlfinent. The Jury was Instructed
to acquit, but refused to obey the court.
ThÂ» members were then ordered to retire
to further deliberate on a verdict, but re
turned into court later and announced
that it was impossible to reach a verdict.
Judpe Dunne, bcir.c unable to force the
Jury to acquit. <r r< d it discharged.

JURY REFUSES
TO OBEY COURT
ant is represented by Attorney A. M.
Armstrong and the case has been assign
ed to Judge Bahrs" department for ad
judication.
October passed, the plaintiff says, and
Judnich willfully neglected to marry her
an<i f&iled to divide his coir.. Hence she
asks the court to make the financial dlvl-
Fion in liquidation of one contract and
r.dd flQ.ft-iO to the same as compensation
for her loss of a husband. The complain-
On August 4 last, it is claimed by So
phie Judnich, she yielded to the earnest
solicitations of Anton of the same name
and promised to become his bride on Oc
tober 14 last. Subsequently, she alleges,
he promised to give her one-half of all
moneys he possessed In the local banks if
j=he would surely become his wife on the
day set. To this she assented, and to
show her appreciation of his jrenerositv
says she promised to marry nim even
poonor than October 14, if he said the
word.
Sophie Judnich filed suit yesterday
against Anton Judnich to recover $10,000
damages and one-half of all moneys on
deposit in defendant's name In the local
banks. Though burdened with the same
family name, plaintiff and defendant are
not related. Were they related in accord
ance with plaintiff's hopes the present
suit would never have been brought.

AS PRESENT CHARTS SHOW IT
The United States transport Sherman
arrived from Manila via Nagasaki yes
t<Â»rÂ«5ay afternoon and was placed in quar
antine. She brought over fifty-three cabin
passengers, 467 invalids, 1S2 discharged sol
diers. 71 prisoners and 12 Insane, besides
the remains of forty-two soldiers, and 246
packages of United States mail.
The transport Hancock, which arrived
at Honolulu on the Sth lnBt., took aboard
the remains of thirty-seven soldiers which
were disinterred. At Guam many more,
bodies will be taken on board, and at
Manila 1300 dead await transportation to
the United States on the transport.
Sergeant Adams, who returned with
Leonard, helped the officer from the field
and for several months Leonard was con
lined in the Yokohama hospital, where his
arm was amputated.
Sergeant Adams is quite as modest as
his superior officer over his gallant deed.
For a distance of 1300 yards the two were
under tierce fire.
Mrs H J- Craft, formerly Miss Helen
\Vi!de'r, came -on the Peking from Hono
lulu Mrs. Craft is reputed to be worth
more than a million. For several years
?he has been one of the agents of the
Humane Society in Honolulu, and it is
said she obtained more than 300 prosecu
tions last year.
Captain W. H. Gould also came home
mi the Peking. He left his steamer at
Honolulu and is stopping for the present
at the Russ.

HEROES OF TIENTSIN
RETURN ON THE PEKING
Capt. Leonard Says He Did His Duty Only When
He Rescued a Comrade Under Fire.
I DID my dutyâ which was no' more
than any American officer would have I
done under the circumstances," paid
Captain Henry Leonard modestly,
when asked to describe his heroic res
cue of Captain Smefiley D. Butler of the
Marine Corps, who was shot In the battle
of Tientsin, July 13. Captain Leonard
end Perjreant Joseph M. Adams came in
. n the City of Peking yesterday. Both \
were In uniform, the captain's left coat j
sleeve dangling by his side. He had racri- i
f.eed that arm to save the life of bis i
brother officer.
Captain Leonard Is very young looking, i
indeed. He Is one of the youngest officers :
ThÂ« marines got into Tientsin just in time ;
The Marines got Into Tientsin Just in time :
to catch the most terrific part of the fig.ht- j
:-.g. In the face of a galling fire Leonard
pushed hiÂ» way to the front to rescue Cap- '
â¢tin Butler, who had been wounded while '.
rescuing a fellow comrade struck by a
bullet.
Butler vr&a found bine helpless on the
river bank. The bullets were flying about
him as thick as bees. Leonard faced the
: creaming missiles, lifted the prostrate
officer and plunged Into the river with his
burden. He was at once a target for the
f.enfllsh Boxers, but his swift, powerful
stroke* soon brought him beyond range
and he landed Butler safe within the
allies' lines.
Leonard then proceeded to Join his com
pany, which had been sent to reinforce the
Ninth Regiment. On his way and at
nbout the same time that Colonel Llscum
fell a Mannllcher bullet pierced his left
arm, chattering the bone.

Do not understand that the ffarav?-

ha? been produced in the human bodv.
But this grape-suKar ;Â« made by much
the same process as the bodv emplovs.
This grap^sufjar is produced by nat-
ural treatment of grains without any
foreign substance whatever. The re-
sult is perhaps the most hiehly nutri-
tious food ever produced.
Grocers keep Grape- Nuts
A New and Highly Nutritious Food.
The odd-sounding name is used to
designate a peculiar food, made not ex-
actly in the shape of nuts, but having a
pleasant, rutty Savor and crisp brittle-
ness thnt makes them a charming fa-
vorite 'vith thc palate.
Of yet more value than the taste is
the food value of Grape-Nuts. They
are largely composed of Grape-Sugar
(your dictionary can tell you about
that), and those who u*e them will find
the morning meal has not only been
pleasant, but . has been auicklv and
easily digested: for crape-suerar is an
r.rticie produced in the human bodv nt
one sta^e of thc digestion of food, and
is at once ready for transformation into
pood healthy blood and nourishment.

NEW* TOR1C. Oct. IS.â The movement of
pncee of stocks became exceedingly varied and
Irregular to-day under the conflicting specula
tive forces. These forces were largely pro
fessional traders ir. stocks and they conducted
ttoelr cj>eratioris with a free hani and on a
lerce scale. So far as the surface of events
showed, a large and Influential bear party In
aururate<i a campaign for a decline to-day.
There was cj*n Felline by an interest which
haÂ« long persisted on the long side of the mar
ket and on whose arcount there was large
tilling to-day, cot only In the stocks In which
there had been open buying for some time past,
but In other stocks all around the room. On
the ether han<5 there was resistance offered to
the decline by the ma.r.ipuliiti'jn of various spe
cla.1 etocks with results In sharp advanw." How
far those latt< r movements resulted from a de
eire to sustain the market for the purpose of
realizing en cth*r Ftooks could only be kut
inlsed. In Union Pacific the selling to realize
wae en an enormous erale. blocks of a thou
sand shares and upward coming out frequently.
Considering the volume of dealings the nar
row movement of the price is a pretty g'>od
Indication of a continued buying demand. The
Flecks extreme ranfiÂ» was 8 Â«. which mensured
the decline, and in the late rally there was
a full recovery. The victims of the late pres
sure were the objects of the bulls' buying.
At<-h!son preferred and Louisville were con
epicu.ms in this category. During the early
hours of the day the acgrtesivneas wae suc
ceeded by periods of dullness until the develop
ment of special strength at some points made
the tone firmer throuchout. Th<Â» first notable
rally was In the iron and fteel stocks, which
were suddenly advanced all arnund by rapid
Fteps from 1 to 2%. Prices of the group then
fill back, but joints of Ftrenrth developed
elsewhere. The movement In New York Central
and in stocks cf allied comijanles. which are
ex;>ected to come Into closer relation was a
nctable one. There were substantial gains In
all of ill* New York. Chicago and St Louis

The expected decline In Hogs has occurred.
Receipts have been larger of late, and Imports
from the East are expected, owing to lower
prices there. Another factor against the mar
ket is the expected Imports of green meat from
the East, and all this works against live Hogs.

OAKLAND. Oct. 18.â Manager Ellis
of the Sunset Telephone Com
pany Is fondly congratulating
himself that he quelled the re
cent messenger strike in his de
partment. But while the local manager
of the telephone company conducted tho
negotiations with the strikers and pre
vented any serious damage being done to
the company's property without calling
upon the National Guard the manager ha3
overlooked one very important factor In
the great strike,
Billy Shaw, the strike leader,* has gtme
back to his duties in the office, has ac
cepted the terms of the company and all
without a murmur. This rather surprised
those who knew that Shaw was threader
in the movement for the amelioration of
the condition of the messenger boys and
the enlargement of the tip system. Shaw
used to tell his companions of their down
trodden condition and when the time
came for the walkout Shaw proudly took,
his hat and went home.
But Billy Shaw encountered a new kind
of strike when he got home. He has re
turned to work without further complaint,
and when the rest of the service saw the
outcome of his strike they accepted the
terms offered by the company of an in
crease of $3 a month anJ returned to
work.
"All der fellers went back to work but
Billy Shaw," said one of the strikers,
"and his folks chased him back."
And the great strike is off.

HIS Broadway, Oct. IS.
The Oakland College of Medicine and
Surgery has been established by prom
inent physicians and surgeons of this city
who are practitioners in the regular
school. The institution has been brought
into existence as an enterprise to fill a
place on this side of the bay which the
medical men have determined is a need
of the large and growing population on
the cast side.
The plan comprehends the opening of
the college with a complete staff of in
structors, lecturers and demonstrators in
lt*Jl, when the terms of all other medical
colleges about the bay begin anew.
Clinics, however, will be started by Jan
uary 1.
The Incorporators of the new college,
who will serve as the first board of di
rectors, are: Dr. Frank L. Adams, Dr.
J. S. Eastman. Dr. Carl Krone, Dr. Hay
ward G. Thomas and Dr. D. D. Crowley.
Dr. Adams is president and Dr. Krone
secretary. Associated with these five gen
tlemen "in the preliminary arrangements
were Dr. S. H. Buteau. Dr. Robert T.
Stratton. Dr. W. S. Porter. Dr. O. D.
Hamlin, Dr. E. N. Ewer, Dr. J. L. Milton
and Dr. W. F. B. Wakefield. Nearly all
of the prominent physicians of the regu
lar school have been consulted and a large
majority are favorable to the project
There is already $50,000 available for thi
establishment. It is proposed to have
modern equipment complete in the labor
atories, clinical departments and lecture
rooms.
There are already under consideration
a long list of prospective students, many
of whom are attending the University of
California. The course In the new college
will be for four years and the entrance
requirements will be fixed at a very high
standard. No decision has been made as
to location. Both Oakland and Berkeley
are under consideration. The possibility
of connection with the Merritt Hospital,
made possible by the decision of the
United States SuprÂ«me Court, is under
discussion.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Oct. 18.
Congressman Victor H. Metcalf of tbls
city Is making an earnest campaign for
the entire Republican Congressional ticket
of the State of California.. As the mem
ber from California of the National Re
publican Congressional Committee Mr.
Metcalf Is working hard In other districts
for the Republican nominees therein. The
following letter has been sent to every
newspaper in the State:
October 15, 1500.
Mr. Editor: In the San Francisco Call of
InM Saturday, the 13th lnst.. appeared an edi
torial under the caption "A Significant Ban
ner," which, it seems to me, carries great force
and weight at this time, and this communica
tion, is for the purpose of calling your special
attention to it. lest It may have escaped your
notice and that of your readers. '
It ought to be clearly understood by this time
that Bryan and the Bryanltes â I will not eay
Democrats, for very many of them will not
follow Bryan'B lead â are thoroughly insincere
in proclaiming "Imperialism," anti-ftxpanslon,"
"trusts," etc., as "paramount issues."
On the contrary these are simply "war cries."
Â¦without either rhyme or reason; baseless, hol
low shams, promulgated for the purpose of con
j fusing, obscuring or entirely concealing the
real issuesâ dummies set up to draw the cam
paign fire of the Republicansâ and in this they
1 have succeeded only too well. *
The issues to be "decided on the 6th of No
vember next are precisely those of 1S96, the de
cision of which that year was bo disastrous to
Pryan's vaulting ambition that he dare not
bring them into the open ag-aln In this cam
paign, but conceals them behind specious and
false issues.
The financial question and the tariff are the
real Issues to be met and decided again this
year, and let it not for a moment be forgot
ten that the present most natlefactory status
of these momentous questions la protectedâ
so far as the House of Representatives 19 con
cernedâby the narrow margin of a Republican
majority of but nineteen, and that a change
of but ten Congressmen, anywhere in the whole
United States, from the Republican to the
Iltyan side of the House, would give to him and
to his followers control of that branch of Con
gress, with all which that would mean of dis
aster to the splendid credit which this nation
now enjoys at home and abroad, even though
we Bhould have a Republican President and
a Republican Senate. In this connection I refer
again to the extract* from a letter to me from
H H Hanna, chairman of the executive com
mittee of the Indianapolis Monetary Conven
tion, given in my former communication to
yCU.
All that it Is possible for us out here to do
in the direction of averting such a calamity
is to pee to it that a solid delegation of seven
Republican Congressmen la returned from
California- The country cannot afford that we
should lose to the enemy a single Republican
district. VICTOR H. METCALF.

SENSATI0NS PILE
UP IN RATE CASE
Documents Have Disap
peared From Office of
the City Clerk.
Councilman Stetson Protests Against
Methods of Attorney McCut
cheon and Court Repri
mands the Lawyer.
"I do not know.
"Was it before or after the passage of
the water-rate ordinance?" persisted Mc-
Cutcheon.
"I told you I did not know," emphati
cally repeated Stetson, who was losing
his temper.
"Tour Honor, said the badgered Coun
cilman, turning to Judge Hart. "I am get
ting tired of repeating answer after an
swer."
Then to McCutcheon: "You are only
trying to confuse me. I have told you re
peatedly that I did not know at this time
when the document was stolen."
Once more did McCutcheon query:
"Did you learn the date when the report
was stolen?"
Judge Hayne now objected, and his
Honor stopped the objectionable repetl-
Co'uncllman J. G. Lemmon followed,
but he was only examined briefly. The
sum of his evidence was that he had
votÂ»d for the water-rate ordinance upon
the report of the Fire and Water Com
mittee and upon general information
gleaned from hearing the statements of
President Watkinson and the public dis
cussions In the Council chamber. His pub
lished interview, signed, was admitted la
evidence. The case goes on to-morrow.
"Vvhich portion is not yours?"
"I cannot tell you at this time. I waa
quite bu.y in my office when the reporter
came to me and said he had a certain re
quired space to fill. I gave him a state
ment and told him that if that was not
enough he could stretch it out. He
stretched out the water part of it.
"I signed it without paying any atten
tion to It, as I had confidence in the re
porter.
"When I read the published statements
I remembered distinctly that there were
statements In It which I did not make."
After half an hour on that subject the
engineer's report was taken up.
"Where is the Le Conte report?" asked
McCutcheon. I'* -"'
"I believe it was stolen." was the start
ling reply by Stetson.
"Is this your statement?" asked Mc-
Cutcheon, handing Stetson a typewritten
paper.
"Not as a whole." was the reply.
Then came another fight upon the ad
mission in evidence of a signed statement
bv Stetson which was published.
""This is a double-barreled affair," ex
plained McCutcheon to Hayne. Judge
Hart allowed the statement in evidence.
"Counsel makes the Issue. I will make
the issue. Either he gets into evidence
an Inadmissible document or he intimi
dates the witness."
-xcCuteheon returned to his seat and
that incident was closed.
"We would like to fight it out." ejacu
lated Mr. Moore. "The whole thing Is a
humbug."
"As long as I can raise my voice in pro
testation I shall do so." retorted Hayne.
"Here's a charge of unfairness and in
timidation." declared McCutcheon. as he
went into explanations, but he was finally
cut short by Judge Hart, who told Mc-
Cutcheon his conduct was not entirely de
corous.
"Has this man a right to ostentatiously
read this paper where his action will tend
to embarrass the witness?"
Councilman George R. Stetson went up
to the witness-stand like a sheep going t>
slaughter, but he was a surprise to the
water company's lawyers. He had read
the reports of the special committee, had
read the statements of President Watk'n
son. had interviewed persons who had
knowledge of water plants outside of va
rious Councilmen that were familiar wtth
the subject of rates and had made thor
ough investigations.
McCutcheon rtarted on a tour to tangle
Stetson by flaunting under Stetson's gaze
an affidavit made by William D. English
purporting to be a statement English had
heard Stetson make in the City Council.
Then Attorney Hayne Interfered and
asked:
Then it was for the first time disclosed
that the schedule and estimates of value
of the water company's property waa
missing.
This is the much discu!Â»sed "inventory"
about which Mr. McCutcheon was yester
day very solicitous.
Cuvellier was mad when the persistent
hammering of Mm was continued all the
morning, and he finally broke out with:
"Don't try to trap me. If you will give
me a chance you will get a fair, square
answer." â¢
In the face of this affidavit Attorney
Hayne produced a sworn statement from
M. K. Miller, one of the city's special en
gineers, that Engineer Hewson of tne
Contra Costa Company had informed him
of the existence of records. Further
Councilman Cuvellier testified that lh-s
company had included an item of iÂ£>.<n>
as expenditure upon the Fitchburg plant
In its report to the City Council, and still
harder wa3 Hewson's testimony that he
had seen a record of the plant sever* I
years ago.
Then the water company begged for
more time and got it.
Councilman Cuvellier was in good trim
when his examination was resumed this
morning. After repeating a dozei. times
In response to McCutch?on's questions
that President Watkinson was given every
opportunity to present the water com
pany's claims the "Manuel report' was
identified.
OAKLAND, Oct. lS.-Sensatlons have
broken forth at last thick and fast In thÂ»
trial of; the water rates euit. Documents
and portions of reports Invaluable to the
city of Oakland and bearing upon muc:i
investigation of the Contra Costa. "Water
Company's plant have disappeared trove*.
the records of the City Clerk. While tt
has been a matter cf common report for
several years that the celebrated Le Conte
report upon the valuation of the plant,
which was made for the city of Oakland,
had disappeared, it remained for Council
man George R. 'Stetson to declare to-day
on the witness stand that he had infJv
matlon tha.t the report had been stolen.
This startling statement followed the
testimony of Councilman Cuvellier this
morning that the report made by a special
committee of the City Council three years
ago along the same lines ha.d been muti
lated and that several pa^ea cccniaining
extensive detailed figures upon the cost
of the works had also been removed from
the records.
Then again to add to the enlivening in
cidents of the day Councilman Cuvellier
charged the water company's lawyers
with attempts to trap him in his testi
mony. Stetson also made a hot prote3t
from the witness stand against the meth
ods of Attorney McCutcheon and bo pal
pably out of order were they that Judge
Hart rebuked the attorney.
Charges of intimidation and unfairness
were liKewise launched at the water coni
, bine's representatives by Judge Hayne,
who resented, iu behalf of the city, tha
conduct of McCutcheon In his examina
tion of Stetson.
To what extent the records of the city
wlth relation to water company affairs
have been mutilated or have been ao
stracted City Clerk Tompklns says he
cannot say now.
"Mr. Manuel, who wrote the special
committee report, tells me that several
pages are missing," said Tompkins. "i
will not be able to tell what is missins
until I have been able to make a thorough
search of the papers in the office. Tiio
Le Conte repoct. I have been lnformci.
disappeared long before I went into the
clerk's office. It would be impossible for
me to say at this time whether there arc
any other papers missing or not."
The defiant attitude of Attorney Mc-
Cutcheon upon the question of produc
tion of Fitcnburg pumping plant records
caused a reopening of thac subject witn
the resumption of the trial to-day. Mc-
Cutcheon flled an affidavit from President
Watkinson of the Contra Costa Company
to the effect that there were no records.

thought of smearing their countenances

thought they would never be able to get
the stuff off again after it had once dried.
Others thought that when it did come off
some of the complexion would come with
it and leave powder marks. But with the
help of a husband one of the ladies found
a coon paint that is perfectly harmless,
and now everybody is happy. It comes

Hev. Jkg Poon Chew, a Cliineso Presby

of "The Chinese in California.' He culled
tile attention of the syn<Â«1 to the "re

TEMPERANCE LODGE
OFFICER IS ACCUSED
Oakland's Good Templars Much Agi-
tated Over Beport That BrotheT
Drank Alcoholic Liquor.
OAKLAND, Oct. IS.â Somebody has
said that he took a drink of alcoholic
liquor with one of the grand officers of
the Independent Order of Good Templars
during the recent meeting of the Grand
I-odge In this city, and now there Is
trouble in the order. Of course, no one
believes it, but one of the members want*
an official denial and so a special meeting
has been called to quiet the slander.
The meeting has been called by A. H.
Southwick, an ardent member of Oakland
Lodge No. 162 of the order, and it will bÂ«j
held 'at the residence of Mr. Southwick.
Mr. Southwick is the principal mover in
the investigation and is going to hava tho
matter denied.
"I had a talk with J. W. Osborn. a
former member of the order." said Mr.
Southwick, "and he remarked that during
the recent meeting of the Grand Lodge
In this city he had taken a drink
with one of the grand officers. I do not
believe that any member of our order,
much less a grand officer, would do any
thing of the kind and I simply want an
investigation to disprove this slander
upon the order."
ALAMEDA. Oct. 18.â Mrs. Elizabeth A.
Groome. the aged woman who sustained
severe injuries by a fall downstairs at the
home of her son, at 1812 'Willow street,
last Monday, died yesterday. Mrs.
Groome was S3 years of age and her phys
ical condition was such that she could not
overcome the shock of the fall.
The fall the aged lady received was a
peculiar one. She was on her way out of
the house to visit a friend. As she was
coming down the front steps of the house
she stumbled over a screen which was ly
ing across the way and fell down a flight
of five steps, landing on a concrete walk
at the bottom. She was picked up In an
unconscious condition. Physicians found
that she had sustained a fracture of the
collar-bone, a broken light arm and a
sprained left wrist. They pronounced her
beyond recovery.
The deceased was an old resident of
Alameda, having come here when the pe
ninsula was nothing more than a wilder
ness, about twenty-six years ago.' She
leaves three daughtersâ Mrs. Saunders.
Mrs. J. H. Henderson and Mrs. Dr. L. H.
Fraser.

MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., Oct. ; 18.-
Howard Abbott, special master in chan
cery to the Union Pacific receivership,
has paid out the last dividend to the un
secured creditors and practically closed
up the receivership.
The last dividend amounted to $1,000,000.
The total claims approved and allowed
footed up to $84,336,518 and the amount
paid from other sources -was . $26,448,720.
Another dividend, amounting to 6 per
cent of $6,102,085, was paid about a year
ago.
Considering the amount involved, the
numerous legal complications and the ex
tent of the interests, the receivership was
the largest ever known. The claims dis
allowed amounted to over $10,000,000. The
total claims filed, not including mortgages
having a prior lien, was $95,0w,000. The
balance due on claims after the payment
of all dividends will be $51,065,000. The
Union Pacific receivership has been pend
ing during the last seven years, the re
ceivers having been appointed October 31
1893. Mr. Abbott was appointed special
master in chancery to the receivership
July 1. 1S9S. ,

cured Creditors by the Master s

WASHINGTON, Oct. -18.â Reports which
have reached the Navy Department are
to the effect that Sublg Bay, in tho Philip
pines, is not a suitable place for locating
an extensive naval station, coaling station
or navy yard, owing to limited depth of
water. Naval opinion has been divided
for some time as to the relative merits
of Manila Bay and Subig . Bay. The
Spanish Government spent large sums on
Subig Bay. and It was thought to offer
facilities superior to those of Manila Bay
for a permanent naval headquarters. An
inquiry as to the relative merits of thla
and several other points was instituted
some time ago, and the - reports for
warded through the commander of the
Asiatic station are not favorable to Subig
Bay, holding that it has disadvantages
similar to those urged against Manila
Bay. Several other points are suggested
as offering good sites for stations or
Â¦yards, including Hollo and Olongapo.
Naval Constructor Hobson has taken a

To Arbitrate the Strike.

George Ruhlin.
"WASHINGTON, Oct. IS.â In the annual
report of Major General Shafter. com
manding the Department of California,
there is a report from Major George Ruh
lln. depot quartermaster at Honolulu. The
garrison at Honolulu consists of two bat
teries of the Sixth Artillery, who are in
quarters at Cajnp McKinley, four and a
half miles from the business center of
Honolulu. He says that the troops should
be quartered In plain frame buildings,
rather than in canvas, aa the climate
along the seashore is very destructive to
the latter. No action has been taken
looking to the selection of a permanent
site for military posts in the Hawaiian
Islands.
Relative to the bubonic plague Major
Ruhlin reports that no person connected
with the military service w.as exposed to
the disease. The effects of the plague
were that the quarantine restrictions pre
vented for a time the use of Honolulu for
a port for transport service.
The transport service has used the port
of Honolulu quite extensively during the
year. During the year there stopped at
Honolulu, en route from San Francisco to
Manila, fifty-three transports, five carry
ing troops and supplies, fifteen with sup
plies only, thirteen with horses, mules
and supplies and one hospital ship.
In addition to the land reserved for
military reservations the report advocates
the purchase of about thirty acres more,
in order to make it desirable as a military
site. One reservation contains 1344 acres
and another 14,400 acres. The latter Is
eighteen miles from Honolulu and is about
seven miles from the railway station-at
Pearl City. One of the indentations of
the post is called Pearl harbor. I Major
Ruhlin thinks this site is very well adapt
ed for a military reservation. A consid
erable portion of both these reservations
was leased In 1882 for thirty years ana
these leases will not expire until 1912.
The lands are mostly used for grazing
purposes.
Strikes Among "Hello" People.
HONOLULU, â¢ Oct. j 11.â Last Thursday
all of the female operators of the tele
phone company struck on account of a
change in chief operators. Subsequently
the majority returned. On the following
evening several of the men struck for an
increase in wages, which was given in
several instances.
Captured a 3>svil Fish.
HONOLULU, Oct. 11.â A large devil

men fought for three hours before they
were able to harpoon the monster.

CAVALRY TO MAXE TEST
OF EMERGENCY RATIONS
Special Marches to Be Made to Note
the Value of a New Prepa
ration.
KANSAS CITY, Oct. 18.â Captain Foun
tain and Captain Foster of the emergency
ration board of the War Department, who
have been in Kansas City for several
weeks preparing the rations for an actual
test, will leave for Fort Reno, I. T., early
next week, probably Monday. They will
start from Reno with a troop of cavalry
made up of men from Fort Reno and
Fort Sill and make n.archlng expeditions,
during which the men will live wholly
on the emergency rations, which have
been prepared at a packing qjmpany'a
plant nere.
The ration is put up in an elliptical can
eight Inches long. Each day's food
weighs a pound and each can contains
three cakes of sweet chocolate and three
cakes of a food preparation composed oi
a meat and grain compound. The latter,
which tastes not unlike j>arched corn,
with a slight flavor of meat. Is very pal
atable. At least people who have tried
it say so. It can be eaten uncooked, made
into a porridge or a soup, or it can ba
made into a mush and then fried. Each
can contains small packages of salt and
pepper. The effect of the food on the men
will be carefully noted. They will be
weighed every day and their condition
closely observed by a physician. The
test will probably last two or three weeks
iand then the board will report to the "War
Department the result of the test.

Supreme Court Confirms the Sentence
of Imprisonment for Libel
Imposed Upon Editor
Marshall.
HONOLULU, Oct. 1Lâ It is claimed tHat
many voters are likely to be disfranchised
on account of there being an Insufficient
number of polling places. The propor
tion of polling places is said to be much
lower than the registration warrants and
tmless something is done to remedy the
trouble fully a thousand in Honolulu
alone will not have time in which to
mark their ballots.
Registration for the Territory closed
Tuesday night, the 9th. The total regis
tration for the district of Oahu was 5891.
Returns have not been received from the
other islands, but it is estimated that
about 3000 names have been enrolled on
â¢Hawaii. 2000 on Maul and 1000 on Kauai.
During the last few days preceding tha
close of registration there was a rush to
the United States Judge to be naturalized.
About 300 foreigners were declared Amer
ican citizens, but in some instances the
Board of Registration refused to accept
the applicants on account of inability to
read and write.
The Home Rule or Independent party,
which is composed exclusively of natives,
held their Territorial convention Wednes
day, the 10th. No nominations were
made for Congressman, as Robert Wil
cox, who led the revolution against the
republic of Hawaii in 1S95, was previously
nominated for this office at an earlier
convention held in the spring. Only
legislative nominations were made.
Prince David Kawananakoa was
brought specially from Hawaii last Fri
day in order that he might register in
time to qualify as the Democratic candi
date for Congress. He was stumping
Hawaii last week and the party leaders
feared that he would not return to Hono
lulu in time, so they chartered the
Bteamer Waialeale and went in search of
him. After registering he took the next
steamer back to Hawaii. On last Mon
day night, the 8th, Prince David was
unanimously nominated for the unexpired
term of the Fifty-sixth and the full term
of the Fifty-seventh Congresses by the
Democratic convention. Prince David
was a delegate to tha Democratic Na
tional Convention at Kansas City this
summer. He is connected with one of
the royal houses of the islands.
The Democratic party adopted a plat
form at its convention last Monday night
in which the national ticket and platform
were indorsed. The local , platform de
clared against the acquisition of any more
sugar-producing territory by the United
States. An appropriation for a pension
for ex-Queen Lllluokalani by the next
Legislature was favored. The payment
of Just fire claims.- caused by the fire in
Chinatown during the bubonic plague,
was advocated. < .-â¢-â¢Â¦
The Supreme Court affirmed the Judg
ment of the lower in tho case of William
H. Marshall, who was sentenced to serve
six months for criminal libel. Marshall
was the editor of a weekly paper called
the Volcano and attacked the Integrity
of the late Chief Justice Judd. In ruling
on the appeal Chief Justice Freer and
Acting Justice Magoon held that dur
ing the transition period between the for
mal annexation of the Hawaiian Islands
and the date when the laws made by
Congress for the government of the Ter
ritory went into effect, the constitution of
the United States did not apply here, but
that the former laws of the republic were
in operation. The conviction of Marshall
was obtained by a majority verdict. Jus
tice Galbraith dissented.
In another appeal, that of George
Edwards, convicted in the same manner
by a majority vote of an infamous crime,
the Supreme Court overruled the finding
of the lower court and restored liberty to
the appellant. In the second . instance
Chief Justice Freer signed the dissenting
opinion, while Associate Justice Galbraith
and Acting Justice Humphreys decided
for the appellant.

The appointment of Sir Ernest Satow
as British Minister to Peking and tho
transfer of Sir Claude Macdonald to
Tokio is' not looked upon with satisfac
tion by the foreign residents generally
either here or in China. The former's per
sonal popularity and his intimate ac
quaintance with things Japanese has ren
dered him a persona grata here in an
eminent degree.
A significant feature of the present case
is to be found in the fact that the Mar
quis is now credited with strong pro-Rus
Â£ian tendencies. If this be true ha is but
representing a widespread sentiment now
rapidly growing that there being little
hope of America and Great Britain unit
ing with this empire to put an effectual
end to any and all Eastern problems
Japan must needs turn to her northern
neighber and her best and most useful
friend.
YOKOHAMA, Sept. 29.â The resignation
of the Japanese Cabinet and the coining
into power of Marquis Ito is the theme of
the hour. The change came as a surprise,
although it was deemed inevitable in the
not distant future. It was doubtless un
welcome to Marquis Ito himself, who has
by no means yet got his new party in
proper trim for harmonious and success
ful work. Although the latter is well or
ganized, it is made up of many incon
gruous and warring elements, and early
trouble is predicted for it, especially m
view of the distribution of the ottices be
fore it Is brought under any sort of dis
cipline. â¢ '
Tho ostensible cause of the sudden up
heaval in politics here is doubtless the
real one, namely, tho necessity which has
arisen for a more decided and strenuous
foreign policy in view of the situation in
China. It is generally felt that Japan has
thus far kept herself too much in the
background in the negotiations progress
ing on the neighboring continent, ana that
the time has come for her to assert her
self, her geographical position her eminent
services in tho recent rescue of the lega
tions, and, above all. her superior knowl
edge of what can and ought to be done in
China, all entitling her word and counsel
to be held to be of greater weight than
that of any other nation. Marquis Ito is
the only man to whom the country can
turn in this emergency, as has been the
case for years past whenever an impor
tant crisis has arisen.

a Change in the Relations
With England and the
United States.

mier, Strongly Favors

David M. C&rvalho, the next expert wit
ness, declare- that the signatures to the
disputed checks for $25,000 and $65,000 were
forgeries, tho work of an unskilled forger.
He thought that if the tracings had been
filled in bread had been used over the dry
ink to efface the tracing. In the initial
letter of the signature in the $65,000 check
the witness testified to having found un
mistakable evidence of tracings. The
formation of the characters of this check,
he said, as compared with those in the
$25,000 check, were widely different. Wit
nesses had examined the checks drawn on
the Fifth-avenue Trust Company and pro
nounced them forgeries.
William J. McKiistry, the first hand
writing expert witness for the prosecu
tion, was next called. He said the sisjna
tures to the checks for $25,000 and $G5.000
were not written by the same hand that
wrote the signatures on the standards of
comparison submitted to him. On cross
f-xamlnatlcn Expert McKli.f*try said he
had made an exarr.'natlon of the checks
In the ofilce of counsel for Captain Baker
October 3 and had verbally reported on
the same to Captain Baker that the signa
tures were forgeries and that tho tracings
were of a very poor kind from one model.
McKinstry testified that the checks drawn
on the Fifth-avenuo Trust Ccmpany, the
revocation of Captain Baker's right to
enter Rice's vault, an assignment of prop
erty and several other instruments were
forgeries.
James A. Baker Jr., the next witness,
said that he had been Rice's counsel ever
since he had been admitted to the bar.
He knew Jones very well. He then told
of his visit here after Rice's death and of
his getting some papers a few days later
from Patrick. These were the alleged
forged checks, one for $25,000 and the other
for $65,000. The checks were irlven him
voluntarily by Patrick, he said. In wit
ness' judgment the signatures Â¦ were not
those of William M. Rice. The witness
admitted being influenced by the report
from the experts in disputed handwriting
regarding the signatures to the checks.
He said he had not passed upon the gen
uineness of the signatures until the ex
perts declared them forgeries.
Witness was handed a number of letters,
some of which he identified as being in
the handwriting of Mr. Rico and others
he said were not. The wltr.ess said he
would not swear that the $25,000 check was
not signed by Rice, but in his best opinion
it was not.
Wetherbee identified the $25,000 check as
that which had been brought into his of
fice by John H. Wallace for comparison
with canceled checks of Rice.
It was brought out that Wotherbee's
first meeting with Jones after Jones' prop
osition to the witness to write a bogus
will was. in February, this year. The
meeting, witness said, occurred in the hall
of the bank; that he (witness) met Mr.
Middlewood last March, and that after
telling Middlewood of the Jones proposi
tion prepared the affidavit relating to it
and swore to it March 21 before Miss Mil
ler, a notary. Asked why he did this,
witness replied that he was apprehensive
that Jones might repeat the conversa
tion which he and witness had about the
will proposed by Jones. â¢ The witness said
he wanted to be prepared for Jones. Wit
ness also said ho wanted Jones to 'come
to his house again and that Jones could
repeat his previous conversation in the
hearing of witnesses, but Jones would
not come.
\y. O. Wetherbee, 1 who was on the stand
yesterday, was cross-examined by Law
yer House for the defense. He said that
the appointment between I himself and
Jones lor the meeting was made by tele
phone January 3 last and at the meeting
Jones unfolded a plan to get up a will dis
posing of the property of the dead million
aire. Witness said the object of his visit
to Rico in January, l'JOO, was to get a loan
of $7000 to take up a debt on property held
by witness in Texas, but he did not suc
ceed.
NEW YORK, Oct. 18.â Preliminary pro
ceedings in the Rice case were resumed
to-day before Magistrate Brann. The
accused are Albert T, Patrick and Charles
F. Joms. The former was counsel In this
city for the late William M. Rice and the
latter was Rice's secretary and valet.
They are charged with forging the name
of William, M. Rica to a check for $25,000
drawn on Swenson & Sons of this city.

Republicans held an enthusiastic meet
ing a.t Franklin Hall, 1839 Fillmore street
last night. The hall was filled with the
men and women of the Forty-first Assem
bly District. Horace Davis, Congressman
Loud and D. E. McKlnlay were the speak
ers. No mention was made of local boss
candidates, and they did not grace the
meeting with their presence.
Horace Davis, president of the Forty
first District Republican Club, called thÂ»
meeting to order as chairman of th<
evening. He spoke briefly as follows:
lly Friends and* Fellow-Citizens: I am glad
to ree so full a meeting out here where we are
all neighbors. It shows an interest In the cam
paign that is very gratifying. Four years ago
we had the hottest political campaign since the
war. The result was for usâ for Republican
ism. It was net a question of Democracy
apalnst Republicanism. It was Bryanlsm. and
a large part of the old Democracy remained
neutral or were active for us.
Now we are face to face with the same set
of men. face to face with the same issues. In
the last four years industries have been
awakened, labor has found employment and
all the prophecies of Bryan have proved false.
In every line and in every direction the coun
try has prospered.
And now we are asked to reverse this, to put
in power the man who asserts that he still
stands upon the Chicago platform. â¢ I cnunot
bc-lleve that the American people are so blind
to their own interests as to Indulge in any
such vagaries.
Back of all the later Issues that have been
raised He the Issues of four years ago. The
election of Bryan would mean the rehabilitation
of silver, the establishment of free trade and
the recurrence of hard times such as we had
In the period beginning in 1892.
The "Rough Rider Quintet" sang sev
eral songs, after which Mr. Davis intro
duced Eugene F. Loud, who spoke In part
as follows:
Ladies and Gentlemen: It seems to- me that
to-night, at least, I am In the house of my
friends, and I am afraid you may spoil my
speech. I can talk better in tho house of my
enemies. During the last few days I have been
in the southern part of the Fifth Congressional
District, and I have seen stamped on the faces
of the people a determination to put down for
all time this Bryanlsm.
The conservative leaders of the Democratic
party have been driven out of It. During my
term In Congress I have seen the old Demo
cratic leaders driven out of the party one by
one by the heresies that have been Introduced
into It.
We know that the Demoerntlo party stands
first for free trade. We know that Mr. Bryan
and his most enthusiastic followers stand for
the free coinage of silver at the ratio of 16
to 1 if they stand for anything under the sun.
It matters not what a party chooses to call
the paramount Issue. While our opponents axe
talking Imperialism from one end of the coun
try to the other, yet free trade and free sil
ver are the fundamental doctrines of the
Democratic party.
The Republican party during the three years
and a half of Its administration has fulfilled
every promise to the people. From the very
moment of the inauguration of President Mc-
Klnley the wheels of progress began to re
volve more and more rapidly, until now we
are at the very apex of prosperityâ such pros
perity as the world has never seen.
I would like to have some one tell me what
Imperialism is in this republic with a school
house on every hill top. The progress of the
nations everywhere Is toward a greater parti
cipation of the people In the governments and
few Imperialistic nations exist any longer even
in Europe.
If I had had the power I would not have con
fronted the nation with these perplexing ques
tions, but we have the Philippines and we
must solve the problem as best we can. We
have an able commission there working out the
details of the government of the islands.
I believe that the people will go to the poll*
in November determined to strike down the
hand that alms a blow at the country's honor
and greatness and to keep on the quarterdeck
the President of our period of grreat prosperity.
The Rough Riders sans again, after
which D. E. McKlnlay was Introduced.
He spoke in. part as follows:
This Is one of the most Important campaigns
ever entered Into by the people of the United
States. The evolutionary movements of recent
times have taken the United States out of Its
isolation and made it the most Important of
all the world powers. We nnd now that the
Golden Gate opens out upon the broad piazza
of the Pacific. The great Pacific Ocean has
become little more than an American lake.
We know that our armies went forth not to
oppress, but in the cause of liberty. There has
bem no thought of imperialism. If the consti
tution be not violated there can be no imperial
lFm,' and our Democratic friends have failed to
show us a single instance where the consti
tution has been \-lolate<l.
AVe believe that Providence itself has brought
it about that the nation In the forefront of the
world Dowers has been placed In authority In
the PhiliDDines. Ours the glorious task to
lead the world to liberty: shall we refuse the
burdens? From Plymouth Rock to the Phil
ippines the march of liberty has never ceased.
