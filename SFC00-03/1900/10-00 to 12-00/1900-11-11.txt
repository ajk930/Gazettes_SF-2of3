THE MAID AND THE CLEVELAND
MAN.
A well-known railroad man. who is also
a city official, took an Eastern jaunt with
his wife last month and finally reached
Bar Harbor.
Wht-n he stepped up to the clerk of the
leading fashionable hotel of the p!;:ce nÂ«*
was a little appalled at the contemptuous
manner in which that mag:iifuont crÂ«a
ture set-med to regard such paltry trifles
as hard-tarned dollars.
**A room in the house for one we^k will
cost each occupant 517." tit> remarked in
his airy manner, as he looked Ptralyht
through the atmosphere just above tho
Questioner's hat.
"And mca!s?"
"Moals are $21 per woik for oach per
son."
"There was a brief silence, during which
the Cleveland ir.un made a rapid mental
calculation.
But licforo be could speak the clerk
again put in his oar.
*'Jn addition to the other charges." hf
rrmarkrd in a voice as monotonous as
Dan Daly's, "each guest must pay $10 for
the maid."
The Cleveland man smiled. He fancied
he had the ciÂ»*rk this time.
"Why, we haven't any maid," he chuc
kled.
"I understand." said thÂ«Â» -clerk In his
iciest manner; "but I did not reter to your
maid. I referred to our maid. Each guest
of the hcuse will lay $10 per week for the
services cf the maid in caring for the
room occupied by raid gutst."
The Cleveland man stared. He is famil
iar with hotels of every description and in
all yrrtiors cf the country, but he haJ
never fcefore run up ngH T nst quite so hard

Went With the Side Just Once.
Not a!l the residents of Cape Cod are
eccentric, as those who are not familiar
with the region might Infer from the
many stories which are told of queer
characters there But It is no doubt a
fact that many Cape Cod people have
strongly accentuated dispositions In one
way or another.
In Cotuit. many years ago. a local le
gend runs. Captain Barnabas Z and
his wife. Abigail, who were both queer
aftrr their way. lived at peace for a good
many.;, cars, in spite of the fact that Ab
israil was said -to be the "contrariest
woman in Cape Cod." Whatever was said
or proposed she was always sure to go
ajiainst it.
J5ut Captain Barnabas was as natien*
as his wife was contrary and by dint
of always allowing for his wife's disposi
tion and usually proposing the exact op
posite of what he wished her to do he
pot along very comfortably for r_anv
years.
But at last on one evil day. when Mrs.
Abigail Z was down at the harbor
visiting a relative on board a schooner
then in port, she fell overboard and sanK
in the water.
Captain Barnabas was near by and wai
called in haste. He reached the spot and
Immediately went out In a- boat to search
for his wife.
"Look here!" some one called out fran
tically, seeing him push off. "You're go
ing the wrong way of the tide. You're
looking up the tide, not down tl.e tide."
The captain kept on.
"Mebbe." said he. calmly, "you weren't
acquainted with Abisail. If 'twas any
body else they'd gone with the tide, but
bcin' as it's Abigail I reckon If she hain't
gone against the tide it warn't her that
fell in."
This time Barnabas' philosophy waÂ»
wrong. His wife's body was found next
day down the harbor. For once she haJ
Cone with the tide.

3In going downward from the hair, stop a
few moments at the eyebrows. Brush
thrm every daylnto a graceful curve. It's
all very well for us who havev.stralght
eyebrows to content ourselves with the
thought that they indicate brains, but we
know that we'd rather see our daughters
growing up with arched .. ones. A small
tooth brush,' persistently used, will do the
work. Dip it in olive oil to stimulate the"
growth of sparse -eyebrows. Or try an.
ointment made of one dram boric acid,
one-half ounce vasaline, one-half ounce

Never pull out hairs from eyebrows that
meet. They. will only grow the thicker for

Don't let hair-treatment people, who
operate behind flaming advertisements,
touch the young, delicate growth of hair,
whose salvation means so much to her fu

Until she is two' or three years old, her
hair is not very long and it is easily
washed every day at the time of the
morning bath. Afterward, once a week is
often enough and the simple' sudsing is
dignified into a shampfco. Make a mixture
of beaten eggs â whites and yellows,
whipped togetherâ tq.'.which a pinch of
borax and half a v cupful of warm water
are added. Rub this mixture thoroughly
through the hair and into the scalp, rinse
with warm water and dry as quickly as
possible. The scalp should be wiped first,
then the hair dried with a towel, or, bet
ter yet, in the sun and wind, provided the
day be warm enough.
Brush out the hair at night. Ten to
one, you are in the habit of braiding it.
Don't do it. You say it is neat and com

great fun to talk about which ones had

Before the fun of the game was over
every one of the Finger Family was clean

And by the way, manicuring should be
just as much a part of the baby toilet as
of the grown-up one. It's a good prin

in every respect as dainty as. if she were
old enough to care for . herself. Dirty
finger nails are the inevitable result of

Dtums of joy in the Vieighbqrhqod'of the

of rescuers rode in at nightfall. Juan
Garcia had " almost recovered from the
blow, but hia sister Lola was still grief-
to be looking behind and saw Hie srnok*

and two minutes later the abductor! was
caught in his own trap and the trailers
were standing over his dead body.^Y
But his plan miscarried. At his first
shot one of the rescuing party happened
There were five of them against one man.
but that one had a great advantage, and
moreover had hastily prepared himself
against attack. He had run a low, brush
wood tunnel from the cave to a bunch of
logs some fifty yards away. From these
logs he had planned to steal to the rear
of any besieging force and so pick them
off with his rifle. '*ijl^
Next morning another rescuing party,
following the tracks of the Garcia party,
came ujjon Juan Garcia lying w#ak and
helpless by the spring. One of the men
remained with him, while the others, fol
lowing Gonzales' tracks, came in sight of
the cave.
Juan Garcia tenderly lifted his sister and
carried her to the spot where the horses
were tethered. It was a slow, tedious
Journey home In her weakened condition.
The second night Juan left Lola at the
camp fire ar.d went to the spring for wa
ter. A man watching him from the brush
stole stealthily down and as Garcia stoop
ed for water he struck him over the head
with a pistol butt. Lola was once more
swung into a saddle. .The bold .abductor
this time was Gonzales. He had disap
peared Immediately after the affair on the
day of the fiesta. Diablo's knife thrust
had not been a deep one, and as soon
as he was able to move Gonzales started
in pursuit of Diablo. Gonzales carried
the girl back to the same cave and that
fact Is considered proof that he and Di
ablo had originally planned the abduction
together, but that Diablo, as was his
habit, had played false.*
There was an answering, quick, sharp
report, another and another, and when
the smoke cleared "Diablo" Blanco was
dead.
The wound bled so freely that the ha'f
crazed eirl saw In it her first gleam of
hope. With dilating eyes she watched her
captor gasp for breath. Then she careful
ly crawled to the entrance of the cave.
Her brother was close to it and at a call
from her he made a dash for the entrance,
purposing to catch Diahlo off his guard,
and thinking to best him in his weakened
condition.' But Diablo was on the alert
and aa Garcia jumped over, the barriers
a bullet whizzed by his head.

I eclipses Â£.11 ' other tales of law

of the owners of the famous Dolores mine
In Mexico.
Mr. Beveridge Is a San Francisco man,
and was in El Paso awaiting tlfe arrival
of his wife, when he gave a meager ac
count to the press correspondents. A
letter Â¦written hy a Californian Vho lives
near the Dolores has Just arrived here,
giving a full account of the affair.
It is a story that reads like a highly col
ored romance. It Is a ta!e of the rescue
of Lola Garcia, who has suffered the
Et.rar.gest imprisonment in the history of
girl captives.
For nearly four weeks Lola Garcia was
held captive in a lonely mountain cave.
Once she almost pained her freedom.
only to be snatched back again into the
cave witn a different jailer.
At last she was rescued and returned to
her home. And from the Dolores mine
to Durango men are marveling at the
etrange adventures that have befallen
this hapless young girl.
The trouble began 'on September 16
last, at the errand fandango in honor of
Mexico'6 birthday. From near and far
the miners gathered to celebrate tha
great fete day. No one had made livelier
preparations for it than Lola Garcia. At
the fandango in the Plaza Diaz she and
Pedro Sanchez would make public their
betrothal, and Lola wished to look her
loveliest. She had chosen Pedro of the
three suitors who begged her hand, not
because he was wealthyâ for her other
two admirers had muchu dinero â but be
cause he had really won her heart-
The day before the liesta Pedro, on a
spirited black horse and handsomely
dressed in tasseled sombrero, serape and
slashed trousers, rode up to the little
flower-covered hacienda of the Garcias.
From a crossroad It chanced that Gon-.
zales, one of the rival suitors, saw him.
Gcnzales could see the warm greeting
which Pedro received. Ke saw Lolita
kiss a rose and fling it at her lover. Be
fore Pedro spurred his horse Gonzales
caught his whispered "A manana, Lo
lita."
Gonzales, mad with jealousy, made for
the Garcia hacienda.
"Will you go to the fiesta with me?" ha
bluntly demanded of Lola.
"I go with Senor Eanchez," she replied,
Â¦Imply.
"For the last time," said Gonzales, and.
mounting his horse, he rode furiously
down the lane.
Within an hour the whole town knew
that Pedro ianchez was going to take
Lola to the ball. "She has accepted him."
said the duenas. "Let them beware of
Miguel Blanco." answered the men, who
knew the character of Ix>la's third suitor.
Blanco was called Diablo, and fully lived
up to his name. When he heard of the
choice Lola had made his jawa set like
a wolf's, and ttie true devil's look shot
from his eyes.
The day of the fiesta mirth held sway,
and the sparkling senoritas and hand
some cavaliers made the plaza ring with
their merriment. Triumphant among
them all was Pedro Sanchez, wlio, breath
less and exulting, led Lola through the
graceful movements of "el son," a
favorite Mexican dance. Gay, laughing
couples watched them, clapping approval.
As Sanchez whirled through the crowd
with his fair partner an arm reached for
ward with a knife and caught him in the
back. He had hardly touched the ground
when Gonzales seized the screaming girl
and dragged her through the terror
stricken crowd.
What his intentions were no man knows,
nor docs any man know whether he and
Diablo bad together planned to kill San
chez in the height of his triumph and ab
duct the girl. At any rate, as the crowd
6urced forward to save her from Gon
zales, DIabio ran swiftly from one side

As soon as the people recovered their

three weeks they tralledup hill and down
ravines, finding never a* trace of the ab

endorsement. There is nothing more beneficial or more con
ducive to robust health than plenty of outdoor exercise, partic
ularly walking. The tramping costume is also a commendable
step toward the better. The woman who tramps free and untram
meled by the uncomfortable and injurious nonsense of conven
tional dress is bound to develop a physique far superior to that of
the indoor woman. . -

of dress are three'things essential to the physical building up of
euch women as California, with all her natural encouragements of
freedom and climate, ought to produce. - . . ';. - .-.-â¢-
Aside from the actual bodily development, the fresh air and

to the disposition. DR. ALBERT ABRAMS,

been an annual excursion to the lands
below the Santa Fe.
In the latter part of August the expe
ditions start. From" the four tribes they
come; bands of thirty or forty men, each
band under the leadership of one. The
tribes never combine on a hunt, but they
often cross one another's path, and their
relations are always friendly. They are
friendly with the whites, too.
They take along two or" three saddle
horses and as many burros apiece, for
there will be pUnty of meat to carry back,
to say nothing of horns and skulls that
can be sold to traders. The Indians have
the economy of industry down to a fine
point, and they never waste a possible
bone of a slain animal.

when the hunt begins. I came by a Na

hogar.hold was getttag ready.
"My blanketâ the new one!" he shouted
to his wife.
She was breaking sticks several yards
away, and she discreetly didn't bear. She
broke sticks faster.
"My blanket!" he roared.
She broke t ticks still faster and leaned
fax over them and saw only the sticks.
He walked siowly to her and kicked her.
She made no remark, but went on break
ing btlcks. He kicked her -again, and 1%
took three times more to make an im
pression. Then 8he rolled over in a hea Â¦
end looked as if she had -become a goou
Indian at last.
"Answer!" he said, and then he saw tha\
she was past answering, and he kicked!
her for that, too. He muttered all- the
way back to the hogan. and when he got
there he explained the case, between' Na>
vajo oaths.
"She should weave five large blanlcets
within the year," he said. "When I go
on the hunt I wear one and sell the others'
to traders or ranchers. To-morrow we
start, and I must have the five blankets.
She has not finished the fifth, that Is why
she would not answer when I asked for
it. I have,, kicked her . each ' day for the

When the next day came- I saw the
huntsmen off- Near the entrance of the
village they were gathered around their
horses and their squaws were gathered
around them.
"He's a great man," one of them said,
pointing to her husband. He looked, a
giant on bis horse, and bis blanket' was
eplendld.
The heads of antelopes are always pre

a cow puncher to me.
"How?"
"Saw an antelope's head stlckln' out
from behind a clump of sagebrush and so
I got my rifle and sighted. Just before

Besides the meat brought home then*
are horns and hides. If the men hav*
time they scrape the hides: If not. thev
let the squaws do it. The squaws always
do the tanning. The scraping Is done with
horse ribs, and whenever a band of In
dians comes upon a horse'9 skeleton thera
Is a great scramble for rifcs.
Eagles are prizes. They are iiard to
shoot and the brave who brings one dowu
has several feathers :n his cap.
Hunting game Is not the only object of
the animal trip. There are ranches wher.Â»
old clothes may be Degsed or tv"-Â»ht In
trade and Indian eyes are always alert
for such chances.
The meat is Jerked from day to day
while they travel. Most of the turkey*
ard rabbits are disposed of at ranches,
the larger sane kept for winter. Thj
men live simply while they are hunting:
tortillas are easily made and their ingre
dients easily carried and prairie dogs are
frequent. An Indian is the only animal
except a coyote that I ever caw eat a
prairie dog.
Indians are poor shots, but they ari
more foxy than a white man and that'll
wherein their succor lies. They know
their aim Isn't Rood, so they Improve It
by crossing sticks for a pun rest. They
r.ever weary cf crawling, and so they
sneak for miles after a victim that we
would probably frighten away by chaa
injr openly.
Occasionally th<* whole band of hunter3
rtsrts at the head of a canyon and makes
a drive. The antelope has sirall enough
chance then. Turkeys cars be driven up a
hill; they will run hard all the way. but
they won't fly back, except on rare oc
casions, and this the hunters count on.
The next step is to choose tracks an-1

over the choice and the cr.;cf must settle
matters.
,Â«Â»er their heads and they"are~"all the nap

â¢ Usually they camp for only a Iiight at

and all the other senses that only an In
dian has are strained for sign of ante
lope or deer or Jackrabblt or wild tur
key. The silver tip and black bear is left
sacredly alone; It Is part of the Indians'
religion to leave bears unharmed, very
likely because it Is a safe thins for an
Indian to do so. They have a way of.
fixing their religion to suit circumstances
There Is one custom of these people
that we ml^ht better follow. When whita
men' hunt they camp beside waterâal

to them. While they stay there no ani

up his abode with Dumany, for the latter
will not hear of the preserver of his child
going elsewhere than to his home.
The description in this chapter is al
mofct too vividly realistic to be enjoyable
reading, but it has a neces^ry place in
tho events to follow and the author gives
full scope to his pen, dwelling on all the
irightful details of a trainload of people
cast over a precipice to be mangled,
smothered and burned to death in that in
fernal pile of bent iron and crushed wood.
The pen picture of the young husband,
who just as he is about to release his
young bride from this flaming hell
crashes through into the seething furnace
bflcw; the mother, who goes mad and
would jumpjnlo tho llames to seek her
child.; of the man who prays to heaven
for succor and then spits in the fire when
his prayer is unanswered; of the cold
blooded artist, who calmly sketches with
pencil and paper the different phases of
the disasterâ Is almost too nerve-racking
to be readable.
A landslide causes a terrible railroad ac
cident, and of the hundreds of passengers
ljut few escape alive. Among these is the
Hungarian, who manages to leap from the
wreck with the dumb child in his arms.
The opening: chapter describes the pecu
liar and frightful experience of a Hun
garian traveler on his way to Paris. He
is obliged to share his compartment with
the retinue of v a rich American nabob,
which had in charge the little dumb child
of the magnate. This child is being
brought back to Paris to join its father
and mother after an unsuccessful tour to
different deaf and dumb boarding schools,
made in the hope of restoring its speech.
The Hungarian it- much interested in the
appearance of the little fellow and un
consdously voices aloud in his native
Hungarian tongue an expression of sym
pathy. To his surprise the child appears
to understand him and looks up with won
der and delight. The traveler is struc^k
by the oddity of the son of an American
Croesus being familiar with a language
so little used as Hungarian.

of witchcraft Dr. By'r.gton considers the
farly trials of witches in New England,
and then enters Into a detailed and very
Interesting account of "that epidemic of
folly and cruelty which goes by the name
of the Salem witchcraft." "There Is much
testimony in the books and letters that
have come down to us." writes I>r. By
lngton, "which shows that the religious
teachÂ«rs of that time had no sympathy
with the methods that were followed in
the trials for witchcraft at Salem" vil

the peculiar superstitions which led to
these trials, if they had ever held them."

mAURICE THOMPSON In "Alice
of Old Vincennes" has written a
novel that any one who enjoyed
the best of Fenimore Cooper's
"Leather Stocking Tales" cannot fall to
read with delight. It will rank favorably
with "The I^ast of the Mohicans" or "The
Deerslayer," and is superior to the other
stories completing Cooper's well-known
series.
Mr. Thompson writes with the sure hand
of a mature mind and yet his present
Â¦work is replete with the charm of ro
jnanrp. "Alice of Old Vincennes" is a his
torical novel, dealing with that period of
American history at the beginning of the
American Revolution when the town of
Vlneer.nes on the Wabaeh was a mere
Creole trading post. The author blends
history and fiction with so happy a hand
that it is difficult to tell where fact ends
Â«.nd mere fancy begins.
For place, he takes the picturesque lit
tle ppot of a wilderness, Vincennes; and
for time 8nd events, the raising of the
American flag over the fort of the town
by the Creoles, the coming of Captain
Helm and his lieutenant to assume com
mand of the post for the Americans, the
capture of the town by the English undsr
Hamilton, and then the recaptur</|.y Colo
nel Clarke and his devoted band of men
'efter a seemingly impossible march
through the vast forest In the face of
frightful hardship?.'
The author raise? the American flag in
the first part of hi? *tory and though It
disappears for a brief time he keeps it
carefully out of the hand* of the British
end at last sends it up "never to come
dnwn again." Mr. Thompson's patriotism
iÂ« catching. You can feel his American
ism permeating every page. It rings true
and at the end you would fain do as old
Uncle Jason did, throw up your hat and
phout: "Vive la banniere d' Alice Roussii
lon! Vive Zhorzh Varhlngton:"
Through all these stirring scenes there
runs a charming romanceâ the love story
of Alice Roussillon and Lieutenant Bev
r-rJey of the Colonial army. Beverley
comes to Vincennes as Captain Helm's
lieutenant and after a time falls In love
with the girl, who, while sweet and wo
manly to a degree, is nevertheless able to
(rive the lieutenant points in fencing or.
in case of emerpency, fight side by side
with the men. To catch a little of Mr.
Thompson's poetical style, to feel a touch
of his patriotic Tervor. ami also the bet- .
ter to understand Alice, let us borrow
from the book that section which tells of.
the coming of Beverley: ?

the rle<t. In her brave young heart swelled
the ineffable sonsâ the musir never yet caught
by pyrinx or flute or violin, the words no
tor.pue can f;Â»ak.
Ah here may be the secret of that vigorous,
braie. sweet life of our pioneer maids, wives
and mnhcrs. It ,was love that gave those
irmder hearts the iron Mrentrth and heroic per-
FiFttnce at which the world must forever won

humble liut gnoi and tnarvelously brave anJ
faithful women like those of old Vincennes.

there iÂ» always a something: that you
cannot help likinp. even if you do not ad
mire. His American frontiersmen, Bev
erley. Helm. Clarke, Kenton, are all
splendid fellows. Uncle Jazon. the old
Creole hunter, who has been scalped by
the Indians, is unique. Even when he
and hi? friends are tied hand and foot by
the Indians he cannot help having his lit
tle Joke, though It costs h!s friends a
pood beating and finally results In his
having bis own ribs nearly kicked In by
Long Hair. Litter Jazon returns the
compliment to Long Hair with interest â
but that is a matter for Mr.
Thompson himself to tell. Lens
Hair is a fine type of the In
dian. A perfect animal. wJth the one re
deeming: feature of feeling that he must
repay a debt of gratitude. He is In
human, cruel and bloodthirsty; yet one
cai.not help admiring him for his splen
did strenjrth. his endurance and for his
one act of generosity, which plays such
an important part in the lives of Bever
ley and Alice.
Mr. Thompson's portrayal of the char
acters of the English General Hamilton
and of his aid. Captain Farnsworth, is
very fair, considering, the author's un
doubted Americanism and the excellent
opportunity here afforded him to asperse
the enemy â for the story is written in the
Epirit of 1776 and not In that of 15D0.
In picturing the volatile spirit of the
Creoles, Mr. Thompson, is at his best.
He handles the great, rough Gaspard
Reussillon with just the proper tact to let
the reader Fee him as he really wasâ a
bit of a blowhard and yet a brave man.
Â¦with a good heart under his vest.
The book Js filled with dramatic situa
tions. One of the strongest is that
wherein is told the advance of Clarke and
his men through the wilderness to recap
ture from Hamilton the town of Vin
eennr?. The unflagging zeal of the com
mander, who was ever in the lead and so
v.cll knew how to handle the sterling
tout rough and unruly men. with Â¦whom he
accomplished so much in the cause of lib
erty, is brought out most strongly here
and again later in the actual capture of
the fort and surrender of Hamilton.
Yet another powerful scene is the duel
In the moonlight between Hamilton and
Father Beret. Father Beret is a genial,
kindly old Jesuit priest whose past is
hinted at in the story, but never told.
He ha* acted In a measure as the guard-
Ian of Alice and also taught her how to
fenceâ an art learned in days for him
long dead: His skill with the rapier gives
a hint as to his past position In life, and
the- way !n which he uses his sword tricks
to Uisarm Hamilton is a revelation . to
both the General and the reader. Father
Deret is one of the most lovable charac
ters in the book. He combines all the
gentleness and goodness of the sa:nt with
the bravery and strength, upon occasion,
of the tried soldier.
The greatest climax of all is. the rais
in? of the American flagâ the flag that
Alice took from the British and that Tiad

victory of the Americans. Here It Is .that

"You called me Hiram."

"What has gone wrong, my friend?"
"Oh! nothing."
"I thought you liked this English fellow;
said you did. and even wanted to make his

"So 1 do still," said Dexter with a sud
den change of manner. "In proof of

put a ten thousand dollar share to his
crÂ«Â«1it in the new mine."
"Vou will?"
"Yet-, and you can make whatever ar

"I can always do that. Dexter," said
Storey somewhat sharply.
"But I am your bipgest stockholder.".

I would like to. travel, and mean to when
I have saved morrey enough. I intend to

"Not rich enough, eh?" "
"Too poor, certainly, to realize what you
would want to do for me."
"If I had all the wealth In the world,
Zella,. it would not be too much for me to
lavish upon you."
"Now that's silly. I wouldn't be very
rich if I might be. Everybody knows that

Look at Mr. Dexter! He used to seem
quite happy, but ever since he tapped

"While Dlgges and Dexter were con
ferring; on various questions that might
be to their mutual advantageâ one the
capitalist and the other the miner, who
has staked his claim and worked it with
hi. own hands, Ned Glover and Zella
Brunnen were sailing Zella's boat off a
pleasant point on the lake, whence they
could see the rooftops and the budding
trees of their Parkslde home.
Ned. in a suit of navy blue serge, was
sitting in thfi stern of the tiny yacht, a
white silk wrap about hia neck. The wind
having dropped, he had been rowing, and
had Just dropped anchor In the little cove,
where Zella was often in the habit of
reading a book or casting a lino before
Koing to her duties in a morning, or after
the labors of the day, for the springtime
had come, and the lake had dreamy
hours, a3 she had â dreamy hours of sunny
rest fulness.
"A wonderful lake," Glover waÂ» saying,
as she reclined amidships, among a pile of
cushions. "Has its quiet, hopeful days, as
we have, and Its storms of doubt and dis
appointment."
"Not a good simile. Ned." the girl re
plied. "It has no doubts and fears; it is
as unimpassloned as a snake, as cruel as
a tiger; takes a mariner by the throat and
chokes him. and the next moment smiles
as if nothing had happened. Don't let tis
get sentimental, Ned.
"As If one could possibly help It, Zella,
minder of the nature of my occupation
would only stimulate me to a higher am
bition. ... And. Zella, talking of the
past in a man's life, I must tell you some
thing of mine. . . . Let me tell you
now. . . . There can be no better time.
"I guess there can, Ned." she said quick
ly. "They are lighting the lamps; let us
go ashore," shaking off her wraps and
steadying herself against the mast.
"Now I have made you unhappy," said
Ned.
"Oh, no!" she replied. "Haul up the an
chor." - â¢ â¢
"A breeze Is springing up; there'll be a
moon," he said. "Let's set the sail and
land by the harbor."
"Bridget will be anxious about us; we
had better go home. You shall talk to me
as we walk."
"And shall we go around by Prairie ave
nue?"
"Yes."
As she leaped ashore she 1 took from her
waist belt a whistle, which she sounded
three times. In a few minutes It was an
swered by an old boatman.
"Pull her round to the quay. Ralph;
moor her for the night and bring her
round here by 6 In the morning."
"Yes, Miss Zella," said the man, climb
ing into the cutter and pushing It off.
Ned took Zella's hand. She did not re
sist. He drew her arm within his own.
"What were you in England, Ned?" she
"I'm real sorry ," she said.
"What tree. is this with Its leaves com
ing out so quickly?" V^vi*
She paused in the shade of It and looked
"I think it's a plana tree." he said, won
docingly.
She looked around to see If any onÂ«
might be near.
"Then kiss the plain young woman un
der it." she said; "and heal your broken
heart!"
CHAPTER XI.
SHE LOVES HIM. BUT IS NOT A MAR
RYINQ GIRL!
Of course Glover was at the trysting
place long before 6 in the morning. He
and the old boatman had everything ship
shape by the time Zella put In an appear
ance. She looked freah and bright as the
morning. Naturally she expressed sur
prise at seeing Glover there. She had not
invited him Nevertheless, when
he looked disappointed at thfcÂ» salutation,
she was fain to confess that she was glad
to see him.
There wtas a breeze that carried them,
with a lively motion, out to the north.
. . . Ned was in heaven. He felt the
had never lived until now. . . - While
.the cutter bent her sails to the breeze,
there was a ripple of conversation; tha
talk that lovers make, punctuated with
notes of Interrogation. . â¢ . Zella, how
ever, came down now and then Â¦was a
prosaic check upon Ned's eloquent pro
testations of devotion and his jubilant
hopes of the future.
"They say you could drop England Into
Lake Michigan and lose her."
"Just as a fellow loses himself In the
blue depths of your eyes, Zella."
"Why certainly." she replied, laughing,
"what are your English lakes like?"
"I remember meeting a countryman of
yours who was making a tour of our Eng
lish lakes, and he called them ponds.
"Too bad," said Zella. sympathetically.
"But we do shake the Hag, I believe, when
we travel in Europe."
"He admitted, however, that he had
never seen more beautiful ponds In all
his travels."
"Come, now, that was better, and I ex
pect they are Just lovely, eh?"
"One day we will sail over them to
gether, and I'll show you where Words
worth lived a"nd Coleridge and "
"The lake 'poets! Oh. I know, and
Southey, and 'Mary tne Maid of the Inn,'
and 'We Are Seven.' and 'The Ancient
Mariner;' I guess that's where. you beat
us In your durn'd old country, as some of
our folks affectionately call it; nary a
poet that I know of ever lived on Lake
Michigan "
"Too big for any poet," said Ned, laugh-
Ins. "I guess he'd get lost; yet It might
Inspire large Ideas."
"You should have seen It at the World's
Fair! It gave one a kind of idea what
Venice and Florence and Rome and Greece
and all the loveliest cities and sunniest
lagoons one had ever read about or seen
in pictures! And. oh, what a crowd! Talk
of Babel and London and the great city
of Japan; my, you can't imagine such a
mixing up of the antique and the modern,
the classic and the otherwise; It Just made
your h*Â»ad swim!"
"I should think so," said Ned. en
chanted with the girl's lively enthusiasm.
"Zella, you are a picture."
"Don't be foolish. Ned."
"You are. by Jove! You'd make the for
tune of a painter who could realize you at
this moment."
"You talk as if I were n. bale of goods.
Realize me, indeed! What price. Zella,
eh?"
"What Indeed! A lite's devotion?"
"Not negotiable," she replied. And now
Bhe was leaning against trie tiller. sway-
Ing with It as she kept the cutter's head
to windward, her yachting cap pushed
back upon her head, her face aglow, the
pose of the body showing off Its graceful
lines. Ned might well exclaim upon the
beauty of the picture.
"And do you know the Lake of Como?"
â¢he asked, reclining once more upon her
cushions.
"Are you thinking of the play?"
"I guess I was. Don't know that I hare
seen the right kind of Melnotte; don't
know that I admire him. either; but seems
to me that I know that Lake of Como."
"Don't say It comes from Sheffield,"
said Ned, laughing In his turn.
"I won't. But It didn't require much
Imagination to see that marble palace lift-
Ing to eternal summer after sailing on a
Sunday afternoon by the water buildings
of the fair. I guess it taught us quite a
good deal, that fairy city, with its treas
ures from ever>' corner of the world."
"I might have described It for a London
dally, but I didn't want to leave London
lust then. Only fancy, I might have seen
you! Think of the time I have lost!"
''Not much. I guess: you wouldn't be
likely to have taken notice of a green girl
In short skirtsâ Just a mere schoolgirl."
"Shouldn't I!"
"Why didn't you want to leave London
Just then?"
"My mother was living, Zella. and she
was very fond of me."
"Oh." said Zella giving the tiller a twist
that headed the boat for her homeward
point.
"She would have liked you. Zella. Next
to my mother my t,est, Indeed, my only
friend was Dick Lorrimer. Some day you
will meet him. v.'hat a delight that will
be! Such a good fellow! An extraordinary
fellow In many respects."
Ned's reference to the death of his
mother clouded Zella's spirits. She sat
watching the din of the cutter's bows aa
the .little vessel sped onward before a
rising wind blowing landward, and
Glover 3 eyes rested upon her with
dreamy solicitude. Love has many and
varied moods.
Home for breakfast, their bright and
cheery faces were a rebuke to their fellow
boarders.

So Ned sat at the table until the lasti
and then went Into Mrs. O^Hagan's private
parlor, where to his lnnnitu delight he
found Zella. t She was not, however,

Zella was rocking herself, with v.eii
acted indifference.
"You do go on." she said.
"He talks shtralght," said Mrs. O'lla
gan. "It's natural I'll lose ye some day;
you're young, I'm ould. It's not many

"Biddy, dear," said Zella. bringing her

me wretched. It would break me heart
to lose you; and you have no right to
speak of leaving me anything. You can
leave me nothing I'll cherish half so much
as the sweet memory of your kindness to

She rose as sho spoke and flung herself
Into Mrs. O'Hagan's anna. When they
had kissed each other and shed a few
tears Airs. O'llagan said: "We're jlst a

worst, to begin the mornin' wid lnvokin'

each other miserable. It'B all your fault.
ye base and brutal Saxon!"
Half crying, half laughing, the old
woman glowered at Glover and whisked
out of the room, pulling the door to with
a Jerk of the snack; and Zella resumed
her rocker.
"You have brought ructions and anxiety
Into the once peaceful home of Parkside,"
she said with affected seriousness. "Until
you appeared I was the pet of the carav
anserai and the envied and beloved of
Mistre?s Bridget O'Hagan'a paying
guests."
"And now," said Glover, dragging hi3
chair in close proximity to her rocker,
"you are the admired and beloved of an
infatuated stranger, who Â¦would lay dowa
his life to please you."
"Just as they all propose to do In the
Sunday Mail romances ar.d the dime
novels. It's Just wonderful how they all
want to do it. What for? "Whether a
fdrl loves a fellow or not she don't want
him to lay his life down. Not that he
wants to do it in reality. Not he; ain't
such a goose; thinks It pleases the girls.
Ii s Just hlgh-falutln' stuff and f.zzle."
"You are In a dialetlc mood thi3 mom-
Ing. Zella." ,
"Am I? Talking slang, ain't It?"
"I don't mind it. dear."
"Don't call me dear."
""What then, love?"
"You think that's smart, eh? "Well, be
happy: make yourself at home."
"I will try to do so. Zella."
"Think 'high-falutln's' slang don't
you?"
"I think It's very expressive."
"Mr. Glencce says ail our p'ang is Just
simply depraved English."
"And what's his kail-yard talk, that
pounds like the bagpipes in convulsions'*
Is that depraved Scotch. I wonder?"
"I dinna ken." she answered, laugh'r"
"I mean. I don't know."
"Zella, you're a witch."
"Calling me names now! Don't yon
think you had better go and atrer.d to
your business?"
"I am attending to It," said Ned. "It's
my business to ask you "
"If I love you." she said. Interrupting
him. with a merry twinkle in her eyes
"Very well, that's good business. Do
you?"
He leaned over her chair and seized her
hand. She did not withdraw it. A pa'r
of daintily slippered feet were swingirs
from beneath her white petticoat: a blua
ribbon was fluttering from her full white
throat; her red lips were parted with a
smile that threatened to become a laugh,
and a sunbeam was reddening- a bunch of
rosrs in a vase on the table. Ned thought
he should go mad; but he kept his head.
"Do you love me?" he said, raising her
hand to his lips. "Oh, Zella!'
"\'eÂ»â oh. Edmund!" she said, looking up
at him with a coquettish light in her eyes
"But "
He smothered the "but" with a Caring
assault on her lips that brought her to her
feet, flushed, and bent on running away
"No, you don't." he said, his back to the
door.
"Very well, then." she answered, â¢'you
are not to do that again without an Invi
tation. Now, sit down, and let me sit
down.
"My dear Zella! Oh, It I was rich, for
your sake!" *
"Rich! And so you are, if you are the
man I think you; rich in a generous
heart, rich In an earnest hope; rich In a
worthy ambition, rich In talent, backed br
education. Material prosperity follows."
She spoke with flashing eyes and a glow
of enthusiasm on her handsome face that
set Ned's heart beating at a furious rate
"If I am the man you think me!" he
said presently, as she once more assumed
her customary self-possession and swayed
backwards and forwards on tha rocker
"If I am the man you think me! And if
I am not?"
"Oh! well, when a girl takes an Inter
est in a manâ as. It seems, she has to
whether she will or no â why I guess shÂ«
constructs her own ideal of him; Just, of
course, as he does of his girl."
"I am not what any one would call an
ideal man."
"How can you be?" she said, with a
mischievous emllÂ». "You are a Britisher:"
"Yes; with all a Britisher's faults."
And how many they are you may know
by Â£nterviewln* Mrs. 6'Hagan on theTub
"There are Britishers and Britishers"
he said, with a sigh and a tug athii
mustache. "I am not a bad sort. Zella:
indeed, I think I am more than ordinarily
decent, as men go; but I have been cuiltr
of one eravo fault." *
"Only oner* sho said, pausing In her
rocking. "You are almost as good as

"You won't be serious, Zella/'
"I don't want to be; but. If you Insist

out of the young. man's cheeks.

heeding her protesting declaration. "I

"Don't tell me!" she said again. "We
are petting too serious; and I thought we
would go somewhere to-day and have a

thing pleasant"
"So we will, dear. But when two peo

"You are the sort of girl that God de

said Glover. "I am not that man; but
your love has lifted me Into a path of
ambition and virtue and hope that is
heavenly. Nevertheless, you must know

finally to link your life with mine."

1/ \\ a curious sense of elation, accom-

The l!grht cf her love did nÂ«;t

Ktesif to Z-ila a far more Forious obstruc
liov, and '^r.pc- to h:s own hopes than he
dared evÂ«-.-i wiu.-fer to Zella. Nevertheless,
he was continually 1 . referring to Zella's
position as on,> that was not altogether
desirab'.e in a young, unprotected woman..
In the very word "unprotected" there was
a. rir.R ef reminiscence that was like pleas
fcnt inysic "Tlien let a foreigner protect
you." This maot her bear with patlpnce
hints that ceemed to border on question-
Ings that she wjuld have deeply resented
coming frr.m any other j-erson. She knew
Mr. l>exter was fond of her; so was Mrs.
trHas>Â»; so w'is old Glrncoe; so were the
two professors a; the athletic club. What
cf it? But Â«ho had not heard Dexter's
confession to Storey ami Glover, nor seen
the passion In his face nor the agony of
cisappoiniment in bis eye.
Nevertheless, Zella perceived a change
In Mr. Dexur'a manner toward her when
the told him that Mr. Edmund Glover,
Â¦who had written a certain charming
sketch of a visit to his olflce. had come to
live at Parksiue. . . . "Don't you like
Mr. Glover any more?" she had asked; "1
Thought you quite admired himâ or. at
any rate, considered his work very clev
er*"' I>extrr had replied. "Oh. yes. I
puess he's a white man, as Britishers go;
tnd he's right smart as a reporter." Zella
did not fall to note Debtor's sneer on tlie
word "reporter." This, however, she kept
to herself. She had seen sufficient of the
worid to know how to bÂ« her own con
fidante. Without meaning it. Dexter had
betrayed to the girls quick apprehension
that he had ceased to care for Glover
from the moment he had gone to live In
the house n here ehe. too. boarded. . . .
The discovery troubled her. 6he did not
betray anything more than an ordinary
surprise at Dexttr Â¦ change of feeling; but
It let in a. flood of light upon many seem
ingly trivia! things, that had hitherto
passed comparatively unnoticed. . .
It occurred to her, all In a moment, that
Mr. Dexter had often locked at her with
something more than a curious interest
when he had asked her questions concern-
Ing her girlish life, her hopes and her
ambitions. He had once or twice dwelt
upon the advantages of riches: and it now
occurred to ber that in one of his letters
to a poor relative in California he had ad
vised the young girl to marry the gentle
man who could lift her above miserable
turroundinss. It waf Dextcr's habit to dic
tate- all his letters, private or public, social
or political; huJ <>f late he had written
several to his "sweet young cousin" at
Bar. Francisco who had. it avpeared. been
lell an orphan In poor circumstances, and
who had declined the hand of a very pros
perous and wealthy citizen, simply be-'
cat:se he was twenty years older than her
self. . . . Now It fame Into Zella's
mind to doubt l! ih!s young lady ever ex
isted. She felt the blood mount to her
temples, as she sat down at her desk with
thi^ though* In her mind, and wondered
that it had never occurred to her before â
a!i the mere po, as Mr. Dexter Invariably
posted th'-se letters to his "sweet young
cou.<:n" hirr.se!f. . . . Eut a woman's
perf-eptJon of thir.c:?. and her outlook gen
erally, underjro a keen Â»;harpentng the
moment !-er wit feels the first touch of
â¢ Cupid's MTOW.
Notwithstanding Dexier'3 unmistakable
chance of feeling. h*Â» gave no Indication
of It to Glover; and he endeavored to re
pair ihf mistake he had made in letting
jlits Brunnen into his secret by making a
great pretense of cntoruur.inffa great in
terest in Glover's career. . . Dexter was
a shrewd, capable man In business, knew
every rope of the Hoard of Trade at Chi
rajeo anÂ«l every current cf the tides In
Wall street; but it was strangely new
cteerine fir him in thÂ« turbulent seas of
the supreme passion that m^y come to n
man late in life. Until the advent of Ned
Olcvr. he bad hoped to hold Zella by the
ellccted tics of a fatherly interest. Once
he hr.d rpprocohed her with an expression
of his real feolins; but only to excite such
a panic in the young girls mind as had
made him promptly modify his attack,
and confers for her a "genuine fatherly
sentiment " She was an orphan. He was
alone in the world. Why should he not
try and act a father's part toward her?
She had replied that no one could ever
take her father's place; that being dead
hÂ« still lived In her heart, and his spirit
watched over her. Dexter had thereupon
dropped every suggestion of a closer con
nection than that of employer. To keep
this tie taut and strong, he had paid her
no more than a moderate ware, and had
â¢m ployed her the lull hours that he was
entitled to. Thus, gradually, he had won
the girl's rood will, and a eense of grati
tude for the unvarying kindness with
which he had treated her. ... So
Glover caiied now and then on Mr. Dex
tor. and received for the Mall much val
uable Information about mining and other
Interest*: and, whenever opportunity
arose, Dexter offered Glover a drink
made Sam bring out his little silver trav.
with its champagne, its Angostura bit
ters. Its bowl of cracked Ice, and its snips
of lemon peel nn<2 basin of snow-iike
sugar Just; but G!ovÂ«r was always proof,
against the temptation. Dexter knew that
it was a temptation; though Glovr cred
ited him with the moFt generous of hospl
tr.hle intentions.
The boarding-house, as one man and one
Â¦woman, soon came to the conclusion that
the Englishman was o\rr head and ears
in love with Zolla; and that the young
lady herself. If she did not as cordially re
spond, was flattered by his attentions for
Glover was good looking, dressed well,
talked wit. tang: a prood scng. looked well
in the saddle on a horse or bicycle, and
wae already beg-inninp to make' a name,
not only ae a bricht miscellaneous Â¦writer
for thÂ«Â» press, but as a contributor to the

had replied. "He's a. devilish deal too

The remark vrns made with an animus
that 8*ton1r,hfMJ Storey: who. after a pause
replied. "Oh? that's what's the matter
with Glover, eh? Too devilish clever.
How lor.g 1b It sin^e you have made that
discovery. Hiram?*'
"It don't matter. Amos." said Dexter
â¢with colrt courtesy. "That's my ODlnlon."
"Oh! Very well. I guess it ain't going
to make any difference between us?"
"Not that I imagine. Amos."
"But when you call iko Amos I know
And so the time rolltd on. Dexter dis
sembled his chagrin at the progress Glo
ver had made In the affections of Zella
Brunnen. but in private he suffered tor
ments. He had only now begun to really
appreciate how fiercely he loved her. Joe
Williams contemplated the action of the
amatory drama with no more than a pass-
Ing curiosity. Storey and Dexter had en
tirely made up their qnarrel that had
broken out like a sudden 6torm In a blue
sky- and subsided quickiy. as such storms
will. Mrs. O'Hagan was, in her heart, al
most as jealous of Glover as Dexter was;
but ehe loved the srirl too well to cross her
in anything. Glover was the life and soul
of the table whenever he was present;
but his work often look him away for
days together.
Dlgges had served his month at the
house of correction, and It boded no good
to Glover that . he had met Hiram
Dexter by appointment at the Palmer
House, after the usual hours at which
Dexter was in the habit of receiving call
ers. Not that there might have been anv
thing Inimical to Glover In such a meet
ing, seeing that Dlgces was the boss of a
mining camp in the neighborhood of
Platts Valley, where Dexter owned a vast
property. Dlgges might have the appear
ance of a terrible rufllan drunk and
brawling; In the streets of Chicago; but
away in the wilds of Colorado, a Chicago
reporter would have described him as a
picturesque type of the frontiersman and
mining: adventurer.
THE MASKED BATTERY OF A
WOMAN'S HEART.
CHAPTER X.
"Then kiss tbe plain, young
woroan," she said.
twin brother, I'd chuck you Into thÂ«
street, and your money bags, too!"
Storey was rarely roused Into passion,
but when he showed fight he was a very
devil.
Dexter knew his man. Moreover, the
mention of Glover in connection with
Platts Valley had set up a new idea In his
mind that had acted as an instantaneous
solace to his chagrin at the sudden inter
est Miss Brunnen had taken in Mr3.
O'Hap.ui's new boarder.
"Storey, you are losing your temper,"
he said "qul'ckly.
"It's a devilish good thing for you, Hi
ram, that you have r.ot lost yours at the
same time." Do you know how I and my
wile pet on so well? We never lose our
tenners at the sam; j lime. You provoked
me Dexter. Don't ilo It again." .
"I will not." saitl Dexter, "but don't
think I'm afraid of you. Storey. I think I
wa* in the wrong."
"Say r.o more about It. Come and dine
ar.Â«l k*o to the theater to-r.lght. will you?"
"I don't mind if I do," said Dexter.
"Dinner at 7. I'll a.-k my wife's cousin
to ioin up. She has just returned from
Europe. You'll like iier. She'll amuse
you."
And Â£0 they made their quarrel up. It
was the first time Dexter had seen Sto
rey was greatly moved. When he was alone
he sat and wondered how the trouble had
arisen. It had come about through Ned
Glover. He was out of humor when he
called upon Storey. Storey had made him
worse bv praising Glover. Since the morn
ing he hated Glover. Miss Brunnen had
mentioned him twice. It was easy to see
that phe liked the beggar. Any fool could
gather that from the expression of her
fare when she mentioned him. Of course
the designing sneak had taken rooms at
Parkslde to be near her. to pester her
with his attentions. He must be got out
of the way before he had time to make
any definite impression. It was strange,
even to Dexter himself, to find how bit
terly he could feel against a man who had
done him no intentional wrong, and who,
at their first intercourse, had excited In
him an interest 3r.d a liking that no oth
er individual had ever succeeded In
achieving. Hut for the shndow of Zella
Brunnen falling between them Ned Glo
ver might have become Hiram Dexter's
ri Â£ ht hand - _
"All hands on deck!" said Zella, with
?mock command, and beginning to rise
from her cushions; like' Venus from the
sea, thought Glover, who at once pre
pared to restrain her.
"Peccavl!" he cried. "Avast! All hands
below, and everything else that denotes
'sit still. Zella,' and I will be as prosaic
as the slummiest slum of Chicago, and
as practical as a nigger In a henroost!"
"From sweet voices and the sun in love
with a typewriter girl to a nigger In a
henroost brings us down to life's realltlc-i.
Now we shall get on." Â«
"Why do you call yourself a typewriter
girl?"
"Why do they call you a space re
porter?"
"I am something more than a apace re
porter." ,
â¢ "I am only a typewriter girl." â¢
"Nonsense! You are. the daughter of a
great soldier, you are a. child of the na
tion, an honored pensioner of the Govern
ment, an accomplished woman, aâ"
"Stop! Stop, before you say I am Ve
nus and Diana, and all the rest of them
I know you think me beautiful, clever,
tho music of your dear voice making a
concert with the rippling of the waters,
and the sun just dwelling on your face,
as though It loved you as I do.
"Now, look here, Ned. If you go on talk
ing in that way I shall order all hands
on deck, up anchor and make for port."
She snowed her white teeth, with a
laugh, and leaned back among, her
cushions. In a manner quite the opposite
of her threat. A picture of health, and
physical beauty, she loorted a nautical
heroine, with flannel jacket and skirt and
her navy blue yachting cap. her fair hair
bound tightly about the back of her head.
Her hands were bare and brown; not the
hands that the society lady endeavors to
mold into shape and whiteness with medi
cated gloves worn through the night, but
strong hands with strong knuckles, broad
<hands that could grip an oar, or deal a
blow In the face of a rufllan, as we have
seen. Yet they were shapely hands, anil,
to the . palmist, eloquent of virtuous
resource, enterprising, adventurous ami
Indicative at the same time of stronjj
common-sense. "Glover was not looking at
her. hands; he had lost himself in her
eyes. There never were such, eyes, so
liquid, with such a depth of feeling, yet
capable of flashing angry lightnings.
"You shouldn't have such beautiful
eyes. Zella, so sweet a voice, and be in
such perfect harmony with the time, the
hour, the sunset and the dreamy lake."
"I began life' as a mining, engineer. I
hope to turn my knowledge tp account In
that-very Platts Valley. You know that
Mr. Dexter has made me proposals?"
"Yes, yes; but, ohl would you Quit Chi
cago?" â¢
"To make a fortune and rlÂ«e above the
mean estate of aâ space reporter."
"You know you are a great deal more
than that; you know how . Â¦ highly â¢ Mr.
Storey values your work." ... . >*
"You said I was what they call a space
reporter."
. '.'Ned, dear, I did not mean to' wound
your pride." â¢ -
"The wound- is healed with that sweet

IN MALE ATTIRE$8500 Collie. Ov/ned by J. Pierpoot Morgan of Highland Falls.
Chinese Sleeve Dog, Owrjed by Dr. Masoero of This City,
shepherds cross the collie every, few gen
erations with other Dreeds. ! This produces
a dog with much more bone and chest,
and without the perfect beauty of the col
lie as we know him. Black and white are
â¢the predominating colors of the working
collie. The head Is shorter and the face
is blunt as compared with the fine fox
like mask of the show dog.
Size and bone have been a predominant
feature of the collies that have been ex
hibited recently in the United States. But
. In England there is a fad Just now for
dwarf collies, and delightful little crea
tures they are. They have all the typical
collie points. Indeed, It is demanded that
they be pluperfect. They must be fully
as fine In coat and their shape and limb
must, be exactly as good as they are In
large collies, but they are not' much
larger than a spaniel. Dwarf collies may 1
turn out to.be a fad even more expensive
than the ordinary dog. for if it Is hard to
breed a perfect large collie it is still more
difficult to breed a perfect - dwarf . Few
have been seen as yet on this side, but it
Is said that there will be an Importation
In time for the next dog show. One was
bred in New Jersey and now Is owned In
Brooklyn, which is said to be a perfect
type.
She is a blue-blooded little collie, for
she. has Sefton Hero, Rufford Ormond.
Duncan Gray, Rose Hill Certainty, Lady
Christopher, Ormskirk Dolly, Champion
Seotilla Bertha and Bcndico in her pedi
gree. She Illustrates in a marked manner
the uncertainty which attends collie
breeding. Almost all i;er line were large
dogs. None was unusually small.
The standard of excellence In Judging
collies now is as follows: The dog must
be a lithe, active dog ot elegant and pleas
ing outline, with a combination of speed,
strength and intelligence. The head
should be moderately long, covered with
soft; short hair, skull flat and with very
little stop, eyes almond-shaped, of fair
size, but not prominent, placed rather
wido apart, anil the barker brown in color
the better. The ears should be small,
covered with soft, short hair, and carried
sreml-erect when at attention, but at
other times tjirown back. The neck
should be long: arched and muscular; th2
Â«:hest deep and narrow in front, but wide
behind the shoulders, and the back short
and level with the loir.s, rather long,
slightly arched, yet powerful. The legs
should .be straight, muscular, rather flat
of bon^, hind, quarters slightly drooping
and very long from hips to hock and
hocks well bent, the pasterns long and
springy,'- with the soles of the feet well
padded and the toes arched and compact.
The tail, to be carried low when the dog
Is quiet, of moderate length, and when he
Is excited to be carried gayly, ar.d almost
straight when he is running.
The coat as required should be abund
ant,'excent on head and lees; the outer
coat straight, hard and rather stiff; tho
Inner coat soft, furry and very dense, so
as to make it difficult lo find the skin: the
frill (a mass of;halr on the breast) very
abundant; hair, on the tall very profuse
and on the hips long'and bushy; forelegs
slightly feathered, while the hind lei?8
below the hocks are smooth. Weight of
dogs, forty-five to sixty pounds; bitches,
forty to fifty pounds. Â¦
The defects most to be avoided axe a
domed skull; high-peaked occipital
bone; heavy, pendulous ears; full, round
eyes; heavy feathered legs and short tall.
As an example of a" collie head, that of
J. Pierpont Morgan's Ormskirk Galopln
may be cited. His head is lV.i Inches
long/ very fine and tapering In the muz
zle, and Is considered typical. .
The collie, as he has become known Jn
the United States, is a dog far different
from his progenitor, the working sheep
dog of Scotland and the north of Eng
land. He has been bred too "fine" for
many generations i to i withstand the
weather and the hard work which are the
lot of the shepherd's dog. Exposure like
that ; to I which the working collie is sub
jected night after night and day after day
would carry the pure bred type oft with
pneumonia In twenty-four hours. In order,
to maintain ruggedness In their dogs the
It is not likely that the Scotch collie
ever will become a cheap dog. Few dogs
are so difficult to breed. Litter after lit
ter from even the best obtainable strains
have an exasperating tendency to turn
out worthless from ' a fancier's
point of view. The pups are de
ficient either in bone or coat or
their ears Insist oa pricking in
stead of being semi-erect. This point
about the ear -is on,e of the most difficult
to overcome. Some of the best dogs
shown in recent years have had the prick
ear to such an extent that it was found
necessary to doctor them by slitting the
Bkin inside of the ear and stitching it
down to hold the ear as it should be Vet
erinary surgeons are being called on per
petually to perform this operation. A col
lie that Is deficient in bone generally Is
hopeless. Sometimes careful feeding while
he still is very young will help him but
generally such a dog remains undersized.
This uncertainty about breeding makes
blood that will tell like the Ormskirk
blood particularly valuable. It made Ruf
ford Ormond worth $1000 a year to his
original English owner as a stud dog.
The fashionable color now Is sable and
white. Apart from fashion, there Is no
question about its being the most striking
and beautiful color for a collie. Hand
some as the blacR and white or the trl
colored dogs are. there is something about
the sable and white that makea the dog
look absolutely regal. . Almost all of the
better dogs in the Cragston kennels are
of this color, nnd It predominate so
much generally nowadays that last year's
shojv in: New York was made up almost
exclusively of Coks with this marking
The word "sable", when applied to th3
collie's markings docs not mean black. It
means red. And the nearer the sable of
a collie's coat approaches the color of the
fox the better is the' breeder pleased. A
fine dog with perfect coat of this color,
with . his wolf-like face and lithe move
ments, certainly looks more like some su
perb wild creature of the highest type
'than' lllce a domesticated dog.
It is this "wild beast" feature of the
collie which has Instilled Into many minds
the Idea that the dog is snappish and
treacherous and dangerous. Nothing can
be further from the truth, however, and
if one will study the beautiful, ,doep und
truthful eyes of the breed he will havo
no reason for adhering to any unfavorable
opinion. When a collie's temper is bad
he is about as bad a dog as can be. The
only safe thing: to do with such a speci
men is to give him away at once to one's
enemy. But there is hardly one thorough
bred collie in five hundred that is any
thing except lovable from the top of his
honest head to the tip of his glorious
brush. Â¦ Â¦ ' ' ; :Â¦'Â¦Â¦-, . â¢
breeds* easily. He Is as stately and proud
as a king. Few other breeds equaland
none excel the collie in Intelligence He
is as gentle as a child and as affectionate
as a tine type of human being. He is
large enough to satisfy any one except
the man who loves dogs for the sake of
size alone. .' *>
THOUGH -the Dowager Empress be
head every servant of the Empire,
she can never regain her sleeve dog.
By right of possession it belongs
to Dr. Masoero and he will give it up with
his life. It doesn't seem so much of a
thing for a San Francisco man and a Chi
nese Empress to fight over. But after all
a dog makes just as good a bone of con
tention as a kingdom when two people
'want It violently.
Meanwhile the sleeve dog toddles about
Dr. Masoero 1 s > house and plays with cher
ry colored ribbonsâ they must be cherry
colored and of satin to suit her fastid
iousness. She is quite happy In doing
so and in running to answer the tele
phone- and In pleasig her epicurean palate
with tish and rice. She doesn't know that
she caused a roan to run away with hi3
head before it could be served to Â«tho
Empress, and that she caused a storm of
wrath in the royal palace such as only
a -trust of nations can taual.
Tne story runs in this wise:
Two years ago a tiny black do? wa3
stolen from tne royal palace of Peking.
She made no squealing about the mai
ter, for she never had oetn used to ex
pressing much emotion, or to feeling
much, tor the matter of that. The ser
vant who stole her hid her away in a flow
ing sleeve, as she had all her life been
hladen, and sneaked off Â¦with her so quiet
ly that she never knew she was stolen.
The disturbance was all on the part of
the servant, and it was not without foun
dation. What he had done was to steal
a sleeve dbg from the palace â a sleeve
dog whosÂ«j ancestors have dwelt therein
from time 'immemorial and who would no
more have thought of putting a nose out
side its doors than the sacred dragon
-would think of rising from Its ancient
burial place. Traditions would be smash
ed if a dog of this breed should get away
from the royal household. Once, on the
occasion of the Queen's Jubilee. Tsl Hsi,
An made a wonderful exception to her
time-honored rule and sent the other great
queen a present of two sleeve dogs, onÂ©
cf which died on Its journey. The other
arrived at Windsor and learned In time
to cling to Victoria's plump arm as It
had to the slender arms of the Chinese
ladles, although the stretch was at first
too much for Its little forelegs.
It was the only sleeve dog outside Pe
king's Imperial palace until the rash ser
vant stole Toodie.
For years and years this race of silky
black animals has lived there and been
petted by the tllt-eycd beauties of the
palace. The dogs are no bigger than kit
tens and it Is an easy matter for themÂ«
to lie inside a flowing sleeve. In this
position they spend the most part of their,-

and the chances are that the Empress
will never know where she is. unless she
reads our newspapers over the morning
tea. But If she knew the complications
arising, might be Interestingâ yes. Inter
esting. Whether Toodie would cause in
ternational wax might be worth consider
ing.
When Toodie took uj> her abode her*
and found that she was to be no longer
carried on an arm she made an attempt
to stand on her own feet and in the end
succeeded. Her forelegs still bow outward
and cause her to tip forward, but she caa
run several yards before falling in a heap.
She has learned to like milk, too, and this
liking is the sign of a final estrangement
from the life of royalty.

They walk so little that hair grows four
Inches upon their feet, and they stagger
helplessly when put upon the floor. They
are no more fit to join the world of dog3
and men than are the little-foot women
whose gait they copy.
"I beg to sp^ak io you in private," said
the servant who stole Toodie. He beck
oned slyly and Dr. Masoero's friend fol
lowed him.
"See what I have," he whispered, draw
ing forth Toodie.
"How did you get her?"
"I stole her. I am terrified."
"At the stab of conscience or at tha
thought of penalty?"
"A conscience may be pacified, but tha
Empress! Her penalty is torture and
death."
BY paying SSSOO for Southport Perfec
tion, the grand collie dog from the
famous Stretch kennels in Kneland.
J. Picrpont Morgan has established
the record price for a dcg. The next high
est price (paid for a champion St. Ber
r.sr<a a few years ago) was $1500 less than
this sum.
Boothport Perfection is an Ormskirk
collie. Mr. Morgan and his kennel man
aper. Bob Armstror.e, pin their faith on
this grand strain, with much good reason,
for most of the champions of the past
few years are almost straight Ormskirk
blood. One need mention merely such
names as Ornfkirk Connie and Ormskirk
Oalopin. owned by Mr. Morgan: Orznskirk

Queen Victoria; Sbwerby Squire and

the back will also rÂ»q noticea-,
ble at first. This is due to- the fact
that the natural position of the Intestines,
which are thus displaced, is. pendant. In
doing this exercise great care should be
taken not. to be too ambitious, for it in

The last- and hardest thine to develop
and strengthen is 'the leg. This is best
done by taking the original position and
betiding at the knees, with the weight on
the toes. This is excellent for both calf
and thigh. After a few days use the bells.
Hopping is also a good exercise for the ,
leg. Bend the knee as you hop and sink
well down on the ball of your foot. The
quickest way to develop the calf is to rise
on the toes of one foot with the other
held In the hand. To develop the front
of the calf rise on the heel. The calf, as a
rule, is neglected and does not receive the
proper blood supply, which should go with
increasing development.
Be sure to have fresh air In the room all

Another thing to remember is not to let
the body keep timo with the movements,

exercise you do not want to spoil the ef

strain. Be Fure to avoid jerky or sudden
motion?. Keep the rnind on the work ami

The next thing that needs attention is
the abdomen. If the bejdnner has ever

eating three good meals a day the best
thine for him to do la to lie down on the
floor and raise hi* feet off the ground
with his hands out straight and under
him. After this becomes easy put the
feet under the bed or couch, so that they
will not "fly up." and with the arms at
the sides, raise the body slowly. Be sure
to come well forward. Do the same thine
with the arms folded on the chest. Then
clasp them back of the neck. Do not use

Small earthquakes were frequent, but
not much was thought of them. On Feb
ruary 6, in the year 63, A. D., there came
a tremendous shock, which was a warn
ing of what was to follow. It threw down
a large part - of . the city. Including the
beautiful temples of Jupiter, Apollo and
Isls, but most of the damage was repaired
by the time of the great catastrophe.
The eruption which was destined to be
eo memorable began early In the morning
of February 24, 79 A. D... Spectators, look
ing from a great dlBtance, saw a mighty
cloud spread and overhang the city like
a vast and ominous umbrella. -There wjis
still, plenty of time to get away in safety,
and doubtless a majority of the people did
escape before thfc Impending volcanic
storm began, j Judging from the number
of skeletons thus far discovered, it seems
probable that not more .than 'about 2000
persons actually, perished.. However, a
great many who attempted tb leave In
boats may have lost tfielr lives.
The pumice fell in Pompeii until the
streets of the city were covered eight to
ten feet deep, with it. . Its weight broke in
the roofs of many of the. houses, and .the
destruction' of -lives must have been
frightful. Nevertheless, many of the peo
ple still survived, seeking refuge in cellars
and other such ' places of â¢ retreat. They
must have imagined that there was still
hope when early in the morning of the
next day (February 25) there came a great
shock, and ashes began falling In a con
tinuous shower with the rain. Though day
had arrived, it grew darker than ever, if
possible, a cloud of frightful blackness
settling- down, over the land, while the
lightning and thunder ,were appalling.
Shock followed" shock, and the survivors
must have at length concluded' that their
last hour was at hand. Such was in truth
the case. The storm of ashes lasted
nearly all day long; they drifted In
through the windows of the houses and
suffocated : all who remained alive. They
covered Â¦ the whole city, with \ a sheet of
death six or seven feet ', thick.
Thus was completed the destruction of
Pompeii. If the estimate of fatalities
(
those of children. One woman wore three
necklaces and several gold and silver
rings. These people were suffocated by
ashes which came through' the' windows.
In other parts of the same house were
discovered fourteen skeletons of men; also
the bones of a dog and a goat.
The bodies of the people who perished In
the cellar were covered with moist ashes,
which, as they hardened, preserve* the
shapes. In this manner perfect* molds
were made of the forms of many Individ
uals dug out in various places, and. by
the simple process of flliinf: them Â¦ with
moist plaster of paris, admirable casts
were obtained, showing what the persona
looked like in life, and even how they
we're dressed. Quite a number of sucn
melancholy effigies, representing, both
men\ and women, are preserved in the
museum at Pompeii.
Pompeii is believed to have had "rather
more than twenty thousand inhabitants.
The city stood on an elevation ove/lookinjj
the sea.'-the whole of the Bay of Naples
being In % view, while in the background
loomed grim" Vesuvius, the destined de
stroyer. Close by flowed th(5 RivefSanro,
which watf^crossed by a bridge. The vol
cano was supposed to be extinct, and its

It wasUhe citj' of the clan of the Pom
peys, founded by the Oscans. an ancient
Italian tribe, in the, sixth century. B. C,
or earlier? ( afterward conquered by the
Samites, a rival tribe, and eventually ab
sorbed by "unlghty, Rome. The culture
of thÂ« peopl^ was very Greek: they5wor
shiped various Greek gods and used the
Greek names -for their weights and meas
ures. Being so beautifully situated and
having a delightful climate, Pompeii waa
a favorite resort \ of Â» wealthy Romans,
" many of - whom^had villas there. Cicero
had a handsome, "cottage." as it would
now be called, and thes^ imperial , family
maintained a palace clos'e, by. The villas
were mostly on the high ground back of
wholly dlsappared under the stream . of
mud, sixty-five feet deep In spots, which
had flowed over It. This mud, being a
sort of natural concrete, soon hardened
Into stone, which is to-day of such solid
ity as to make excavating work extremely
difficult. -' : " . â¢ '
\ Excavations were first attempted at
Herculaneum In 1719, at which data tha
elte of ancient Pompeii, afterward dis
covered through accident, was actually
unknown. Though a relatively small part
of the latter city has been disclosed, by
digging, much that Is of. the utmost Inter
est has been ascertained. The fullest ac
count of the subject Is gjven in the. newly
published work of August Mau. to which
the writer is Indebted â¢ for " much of , his
material. Dr. Mau states that the Em
peror Titus proposed to rebuild the town,
using for that purpose money left ' by
wealthy victims of the disaster who had
no heirs surviving. Probably, however.
It was decided that the task was too
formidable, for it was never undertaken.
Dr. Mau says that the streets of old
Pompeii were mostly from ten to twenty
feet wide, the broadest ; being Mercury
street, which was thirty - two feet in
breadth. All -were paved with blocks of
basalt, carefully fitted, together. On both
sides of every street were raised side
walks, neatly- curbed, and paved some
times with small stones and in other cases
with beaten earth. Broad ruts worn by.
wheels are still visible, and at the cross-
Ings are. stepping stones on a level with
the sidewalks, between which the wheels
could pass. The two main thoroughfares i
and business avenues, were Stablan -and
Nola streets. Driving for pleasure was
probably prohibited, the rich riding in lit
ters, because on most of the streets one
vehicle could pass another, and
must, therefore, have been obliged to wait
at a corner.
At many of the corners were fountains
fed by city water, and the edges of tha
stone basins show" depressions worn by
the hands of those who leaned over to
drink. On the sides of the streets were
pillars of masonry at intervals, with lead
pipes running "up>- There was "a'reservolr
on top of each pillar, from which water
XCAVATIOXS at Pompeu on an

and it Is expected that within
the next few . years the entire city, of
which only a small' fraction is as . ye',
uncovered. v.-Sll be resurrected from the
volcanic pumice and ashes that overlie' it.
Recently a fresh part of the ancient town
has been disclosed by spade and pickax,
comprising many houses or a beauty hith
erto unequaled, and this discovery has
lent fresh stimulus to the spirit of zi
search.
The architectural and artistic treasures
thus unearthed are being enclosed in
plate glass, so as to protect tjiem against
depredation by vandals, while exposing
them to view. Meanwhile, nothing is
given away or sold to any oneâ not even
to foreign institutions of scienceâ because
Pompeii is a unique show place, and it
is deemed proper that peopls who want tc
see its wonders shall come to Italy for
that purpose. The Naples -Museum has
thousands on thousands of cooking uten
sils derived from the kitchens of the
buried burg, but it will not dispose of a
single pot or pan. Of gold and silver sur
prisingly little has been found.
The most remarkable "find" of treasure
made In Pompeii up to date was in an an
cient farmhouse, two miles north of the
city, which was excavated a few years
ago. In a room where had been a wine
press there was a big vat, in which was
discovered the Fkeleton of a man, to
gether with more than 1000 gold coins, hall
a dozen heavy gold bracelets, a long gold
chain and an exquisite table service of
silver. There can be no doubt that the
remains were those of an unfortunate
gentleman who. flying from the ill-fated
town In the midst of the hailstorm ,ol
pumice, was obliged to seek refuge in the
farmhouse, and considered that the empty
wine vat offered the. safest place for him
self and his valuables. The silver service
was acquired by Baron Rothschild, who
presented it to the Louvre.
At the landing- place of the harbor, near
the city, many skeletons and quantities of
gold jewelry have beeii found, indicating
that numerous persons were cut off" in
trying- to escape in boats. Even, vessels of
considerable sire must have been quickly
Tilled and sunk by the rain of volcanic"

One of the finest mansions thus far ex
cavated is known as the Villa of Dio

gentleman of that name. In the rear was
a garden planted with trees, charred re
mains of which are found, and with a
:tsh pond in ihe middle. Â¦ Two skeletons
were discovered near the door of the gar
den, representing, apparently, a slave and
his mat-it Â». the latter having a IarÂ«i- key
In one hand and a bag of gold and silver
nieces in the other. Doubtless, they were
trying to make their way out when they
were overwhelmed, the key being that of
the door which opened out of the garden

was distributed by pipes to the houses, all
of which were supplied with running
water except those cf the very poor.
Some dwellings had nearly a score of
Jots, controlled by stopcocks much lika
those in use to-day. Just where the water
came from nobody knows, though it was
evident y brought by an aqueduct from
some elevated place at a distance from
tne city, the head being powerful. Rain,
water was allowed to now down tha
streets, to be carried off by storm sewers,
which work well even at the present time,
borne of the houses at least were drained
by small sewers.
The houses were rarely more than two
stories in height, their windows were few
and small and they looked not unliko
Oriental nouses of to-day. In the casa
of a nch man's dwelling most of tha
house was taken up by courts, colonnades
and gardens, the sleeping rooms being ar
ranged along the sides usually, while the.
kitchen was put anywhere that might
happen to be convenient. Entering, tha
Jlsitor passed through a vestibule into a
n^.? e - ob \Â°, n f apartment, called tha
?iT w }* ic 'l was tn<s Principal room.
Immediately beyond the atrium were a
reception room corresponding; to the mod
ern parlor, called the tablinum. Next
beyond was the peristyle, or family alt
ting room, and In the rear was usually
a garden. Not so much Is known about
the purposes to which the second story
rooms were put.
In the kitchen the- plaqÂ© of tha modern
range was taken by a broad .hearth ot
masonry built against the wall. The flra
was made on top of this hearth, and fuel
was stored In a cavity beneath it. Small
iron tripods, or else projections of ma
sonry were utilized for holding tha pots
and other utensils while the cooking was
being done. Sometimes there was a
small oven for pastry but bread was
bought from the baker. The heat from
the kitchen warmed the bathrooms above.
The Poaipelian house did not often havÂ»
a cellar. Some of the windows had small
panes of, glass set in them, but movabla
Â¦sashes were as yet unknown. The front
portions of houses on the main thorough
fares were used as shops.- which had their
fronts open to the street, so that cus
tomers could buy without going Inside.
The. function of the modern saloon was
performed by wine shops.
Most of the furniture of the Pompeliaa
houses was of wood, including beds,
couches, chairs and tables, but. being of
such perishable material, it has disap
peared. A few bronze chairs and table*
of bronze and marble have been lound.
ivltchen utensils of bronze and red earth
enware have been dug up in quantities,
their forms strikingly resembling thosa
of the modern household.
Pastry molds, ladles and water-heat
ers. In which live ; coals were put. were
among 'the conveniences utilized by tha
ancient, inhabitants, as well as curious
spoons with a bowl at one end for eating
eggs and' a -point at the other end for
picking: shellfish from the shells. Combs,
hairpins- and mirrors of highly polished
metal are numerous, -while much of tha
jewelry Is most artistic in designâ so
much so. In fact, that modern Jewelers
have copied the patterns.
The business center of old Pompeii' was
the Forum, which was the market place
and favorite lounging- place of the town.
It was surrounded by buildings the finest
of which was the temple of Jupiter, and
was adorned' with many equestrian
statues. There was an amphitheater for
gladiatorial cqmbats. as well as two thea
ters for plays. In which painted scenery
much like the modern was used. The
baths were superb, serving the purpose
of clubs, and some of them afforded ac
commodations for both men and woman.

run at a speed of from 23.6 to 23.7 knots, or ]
27.14 to 27.25 miles an hour. ' ' .
We need go back only" a few years to <
find a time when the large Atlantic racers,"
in points of regularly attainable speed, i
were far beyond anything that had e\*er
been done in any navy, and their p*er- -
formances Â¦ were considered " practically ,
beyond reach under the severe conditions
"of cramped space, light machinery weight j
and others similarly, restrictive to the de
signer. . The '. ITnlted States triple screw ,
cruiser Minneapolis about six years ago ,
developed slightly more than 2-1 knots
during her contract trials. As in the cases
of most naval vessels,' it was 'not expected
that this - would be demanded hour after
hour lh a run' of several days, and la 1S93
practical demonstration was given for the
first time that a- naval vessel 'could ac- ' '
tually hold her own with one of' the crack
Atlantic liners. This was afforded by the
United States cruiser Columbia in. her phe- '
nomenal run from the Needlea, near ,
Southampton, .to Sandy Hook lishtshjp, !
off. the American shore. In a few minutes
less than seven days, or, to bÂ« exact, la
six days, twenty-three hour* and forty
nine minutes, the average speed for thÂ«
whole trip being 18.54 knots, or 2L3 miles
an hour. The Columbia at the time was
practically racing' against the steamer
Augusta Victoria of the Hamburg-Ameri
can lino. Making proper allowances for
the difference In the length of the two
routes, the Aususta Victoria having sailed
from Cherbourg', the same rate of speed
was maintained by both ships.. Since that
time high-speed long-distance runs of war
vessels have been repeated, so that the
impression has at last been wiped out that
modern warships were simply boxes full
of delicate and complex machinery,
scarcely fitted for the hard knocks which
they were really intended to withstand.
But among all the swift cruisers and bat
tleships the Varlag's 23.7. knots give her

Watzmann Alp because of the successive
fatalities. From the veranda of a hotel in
Southern Switzerland more than a hun
c.red horror-stricken guests for three
hours watched the fight for life of two
rr.en without being able to aid them. They
were clinging to the edge of a peak over
a vast abyss, having slipped to It from a
path above owing to the breaking of a
rope. Guides hastened up the mountain
to aid them, but long before they reached
the spot the strength of the unhappy men
had (?lven out and they were hurled down '
more than a thousand feet into an abyss
whence their bodies could not even be re
covered. Every detail of this terrible scene
was plain!}- visible to the tourists in the
hotel far below.
Not less than 2.500.000 tourists have vis
ited Switzerland and traveled through its
Alpine scenery between the beginning of
the year and this October. As the coun
try has only 2.933,000 inhabitants, the value
of this immense flood of visitors can be
estimated readily, and it is only natural
that the Swiss authorities and people
should ufe all jy^Fsfble means to hush up
the facts regarding the unusual number
cf fatalities. But they have been so many
end accompanied with such dramatic cir
cumstances that it was not possible to
hide them all.
The huge Olprrer. In the Ziller Thai of
the Swiss Tyrol, has six victims to its
credit. Four of them perished at the same
time. They were etudentl from Innsbruck
and Vienna, and they had made a party
to ascend half-way up the side of the
mountain to see the sun rise on the fol
lowing morr.ir.sr. But they did not reach
their destination. Two days after they
had Ftartc-d they Â¦were found at the foot
of a precipice. Their bodies were shock
ingly mangled. A mass of dirt and rock
which covered them partially told the
story. They had been caught in the path
of a landslide, which had carried them
over the brink with probably not a sec
ond's warning. Shortly afterward another
party of four, again students from Vien
na, started over almost the same path.
When they reached a part of the moun
tain where an immense wall towers over
the road, which is scarcely wide enough
there to permit the passage of a single
pereon, one of the party began to bine.
His voice scarcely had begun to echo
omong the reeky walls before there was
a tremendous roar far overhead, and al
noft Instantly an .avalanche of stones
fwrpt down on them. They, too, were car
ried over the brink, but luckily managed
to hold fast to sozne stunted pine trees,
which broke their fall. When help reached
them they were near death. One had both
his feet smashed so that they had to be
amputated at once. The other* managed
to escape without permanent disability. . -
Hardly had the excitement over these
accidents died away, when a party of

cause the other flgs do not have these em

when these' are examined it is noted that
the seeds are hollow and the fig has a

There is now in California on the Roed

Smyrna fig- trees, besides other small or
chards in several localities.. The trees on
the Roedlng ranch were brought from
Smyrna in 1S85 by W. C. West, foreman of
the ranch, who was sent to Asia for that
purpose. They were procured there with"

THE most notable event which trans
pired In the horticulture of Califor
nia during the year 1S93 was the suc
cessful Introduction and propagation^
of the blastophagus, or flg wasp, from
Smyrna, Turkey in Asia. A long line of
efforts and expenditure of much money
preceded this result, for upon Its achieve
ment has depended the possible dried flg
Industry of California. And it is now con
fidently expected that this fall of 1900 will
bring forth and turn on the market the
first crop of Smyrna flgs ever produced In
the United States.
The Smyrna, fig is practically the only
fig; In other words. It Is the flg of com
merce. For though there are many varie
ties of the flcus, yet only one holds sway
throughout the world and is popularly
eaten. This variety is the only one be
lieved to require capriflcation In order to
effect Its maturity. Other figs, Bome of

fertilized the Smyrna will not grow be

bins, whereupon It dries up and falls off.
The successful Introduction of the fly
Into California !.Â« due to the efforts of
"Walter T. Swingle, explorer of the United
States Department of Agriculture, who
visited Smyrna In 1S3S and sent to his de
partment a. quantity of the flies enclosed
In their native caprl flg. These were for
warded to George C. Roedlng, an exten
sive flg culturist of Fresno, Cal., and were
by him propagated, there being now on
the trees of Mr. Roedlng many thousands
of caprl flgs, each harboring the insect;
ell the figs passed the winter In excellent
condition and there are no fears that they
will not successfully round out all succes
eive seasons. Mr. Roedlng has about 4200
Smyrna fig trees and files enough to fruc
tify about 1200 of them.
This success has come to Mr. Roedlng
after many disappointments. He first be
gan to endeavor to get the blastophagus
Into the State In 1832, when he sent a man
to Arizona and New .Mexico In search for
It. there having been a report that the fly
Â¦was present and doing well In that sec
tion. The report, however, proved incor
rect, as It was discovered In that locality
there were neither figs, flies nor tree's.
The same year Mr. Roeding succeeded In
getting a quantity of the blown or fly-
Impregnated figs from Smyrna. A part of
the consignment arrived In good condition.
The figs were put In among the branches
of Mr. Roeding's capri trees, and many of
the flies hatched and came out of the figs;
but they refused to enter the California
caprls. and the experiment was a failure.
In 1S96 Mr. Roedlng received a number
of the blown figs from a gentleman living
In the State of San Luis Potosi. Mexico,
where they are said to be thriving in
numbers. Efforts were made to Install
these on the capri flg trees, but they also
â¢were unsuccessful. About that time Al

from June 15 to July 1, and forthwith en

over 100 flgs. They entered new flgs, with
the result that over 500 capri flgs became
blown with the flies, -and the transplanta

SUCCESSFUL CULTURE
OF THE FIG WASP
IN CALIFORNIA(Copyright, 1900. Wm. R. Miller.)
IT. was a dark, cold December night.
Polly could hear the wind whistling
outside and dying away until it sound
ed like a human moan. 'Such .a fierce,
wild night! The heavy clouds hung
threateningly low.- Inside 'all was warm
and cozy. . ' The little library never had
seemed half so bright and snug to Polly
as It did this dreary, night when she en
tered It after tucking baby away amid his
soft blankets and pillows.
There sat Jackâ her Jackâ reading his
evening paper and looking' so handsome.
Was there ever such a husband, suÂ«. . a
baby or such a home as hers?
"Jack, dear, do you think it will be a
(V Â»rv dreadful storm?*' asked Polly In such
a nÂ«;-Â»rable little voice that Jack assured
her it would not and told her to get her
book and sit close to him. The' book'
proved very interesting and soon she lost
sight of the atorm outside and the bright- .
ness within, even of Jack,"* who, seeing her
deep interest had quieted all tears, quiet
ly left her to go down stairs and seo that
tne lights were all out for the night. Pol
ly was just conscious of his leaving â¢ the |
room, that was all, for she had followed
the brave hero of her book Into the thick
est of the battle.
And now the charge is made, the can
nons deafenlngly roar, the brave man la
fighting, and Polly Is fighting too, (for
does she not know his every feelingâ was
she not a soldier's daughter?). The hero
has taken the flag, the guard falls back;
but Just at that moment Polly heard a
step, a stealthy step, creeping up the
stairsâ the old back stairs which she i.nd
Jack never used.
Creakâ creak, three steps more. A burg
lar! thought Polly. "The borglar."
whispered Polly with pale lips. "He ha>
eom*'Â«t last." Book and battle and brav
est of heroes were all forgotten.
With every faculty strained she listened.
"Another, step, oh! how. cautiously taken â
still another. Polly knew she must be
brave now if ever. Stepping to the door
she called in a cautious voice. "Jacjt!"
"Well?" came Jack's sonorous tones from
the dining-room below. Then It was not
Jack, for as he answered the steps creaKed
once again.
â¢ With a bound Polly reached tfte bed
room door across the hall. Must- she lock
baby In alone, or fly down llrst and tell
Jack a burglar was In the house? She
knew that Jack had been ill and was not
lust himself.' What must she do now to
help him catch this powerful black burg
lar? The burglar she had always felt
would come since they had gone to house
keeping. With feet to which terror lent
wings she sped down the stairway, and,
.pulling back the draperies, said In an un
earthly voice:' "There's a man upstairs!"
""Where, dear?" asked Jack.
But Polly did not hear Wm. jVlth trera-

when he had so Invited her and she had
turned listlessly away, and he waited for
her to speak.
"You meant," she said at last, In tense,
broken tones .that .were strange to him,
"to "go awayâ and kill yourself*â to release
me from the marriage which you think Is

.For tho first time she moved toward
him. He had remained In his armchair
at the table, and she knelt beside him and
kissed his hand, which she left wet with
her fast falling tears. He threw his arms
about her and presse4-hls lips to her fore-,
head as she nestled eagerly to him, but
even then .there flashed across his mind
the recollection of her early affection for
him and Its evanescence/which, had

Before he had time to divine her Inten

clenched hand and darted aside to read It.
Even In his dull -despair he watched her
eyes, fascinated by the facility of their
expression, and saw the jealousy they had
displayed fade away and become replaced
with intermingled surprise and terror that
could not' have been revealed half so
painfully to him if her voice had broken
into shrieks. Silently she read the words
he had written and then stood gazing

The stillness of the lttle den where he
was writing his farewell message wad
broken by the opening of the door and
the almost noiseless tread of lightly slip

Clad in her soft dressing gown and with
unbound hair clustering in brown curU
about her neck she seemed almost . the

had quickly seen the constraint of -his

asked.

yielding to the grip of duty that has for
a long while lain strong upon my heart,
I go to free you from the bond which has
become so* irksome to you since you
ceased to care for tho only thing of worth
I had to giveâ the love which has been
yours from the beginning.
But the news she had to tell was whis

"Then," she said, "I had & stronger ar

beside the constant evidence of his devo
tion and tenderness to her and had not
swept. away her love for him; how, with
the passage of time, however, custom had
staled .the charm of wjfehood and grad
ually thrown a . veil of indifference over
her nature, but had not robbed her of her
loyalty, though -she had ceased, to value
her possession of â¢ him "'Â¦until* this nfght,

But he should hot go without a strujj
gle.'she tho,ught. and her.sobs ceased and
her eyes/as she raised' her. graze to him
were full of- such resolve that he looked
upon.her with surprise. He had never un-'
til this moment fully realized that she
was no longer a. child, but a woman,
Btrong and self-reliant.
"What do you mean to do?" she asked.
1 "What method have you planned to
adopt?"
Both words and voice appeared to ac
cept his resolution as final and her ques
tion seemed brutally cold. It filled him
with a new sense, of despair and grief
more poignant than ever before.
"I have not decided," he replied, mood
fly. "The river, I suppose, is easiest and
quite sure." Â¦
"To-night?"
"Yes." , . . ." '
"Will yo.ii promise to wait here. five mln- .
utes" until I return?"
He. assented, ' listlessly, and she arose
and calmly left the room.
When she reappeared he saw. to his
amazement, she had donned her hat and
Shoes and' had slipped a long cloak over
her 1 dressing gown. To his astonished
ejaculation of inquiry she answered:
"It means that, as 'your wife, 'I "claim a
wife's right to share all things with you.
You "sought to 1111 my life with love and
brightness and happiness, and I have been
ungrateful and have driven you to de
spairâto Insanity, I think. But In this
last hour I have learned a lesson I can
never forget. Since you will not believe
in it and cannot trust In my repentance
enough to think that there Is happiness In
store for you yetâ come! We will go. to
gether. You shall not leave me alone.". â¢
"Margaret!" he cried, and dashed to her
side and tore the covering from her head,
and with his arms clasping her tlghtly
to him pressed kisses upon her hair and
eyes and lipsâ such kl*ses as she had not
known for many weeks, because she had
not welcomed them when they, were of
fered. As her arms tried, to draw
him closer to her' heart, happy tears wet
both their faces, and- neither, knew which
wept the more for Joy. .It was riot until,
reunited,. they. had sat together for many
hours in the big^armchalr before the flr,e
as they had been accustomed to do when
they had first come to their home' after
the honeymoon, and the honeymoon Itself,
seemed never-ending, that ; she confessed
to him that she -had had- no Intention of
dying with him or of permitting him to
die and had meant only to make" him be
llevo In her love for him.
"What If your ruse bad failed?" ha
asked.
strolling about the halls or Bitting in cozy
nooks and corners. . Nellie Payton sat in
one of these vainly endeavoring to Inter
est herself in a very conventional de
sign, at the same time letting her gaze
wander restlessly over the ballroom floor,
when suddenly it was arrested by a "de
sijrn" in bold Teflef upon the glistening
expanse; s<Â» different from any she had
ever seen In a ballroom she unconscious
ly straightened herself from her listless
attitude and regarded him with studied
interest as he stood there, evidently un
accjjstomed to such a scene, taking men
tal note of everything. The finely shaped
head was covered with a profusion of rich
brown hair, parted very decidedly upon
the left side; and the swarthy complex-
Ion seemed only a very few shades lighter
than the neat brown business suit he
wore. With his large hat in his hand he
was .Just ready for flight at the first ap
pearance of the dancers. He awakened
himself with a start from his deep medi
tation upon hearing his name called* and
finding himself -presented to Miss Payton
as "Mr. Randell, a gentleman from In
diana, though not th* one of book fame."
Just then the orchestra struck up a
dreamy waltz and Nellie's low exclama
tion of ''Eureka! Eureka!" was not over
heard.
"Yek, Miss Payton, I leave to-morrow
for my home In Indiana. The purport of
th'= call !s to allow you an opportunity
for any little word unsaid or deed left
undone In the love-making line, which
line you handle to adroitly."
At each cruel word the girl's head sank
lower in deep humiliation and shame as
her many views and little acts loomed
up before her In awful shapes. She saw it
all so plainly now since the scales had
been so cruelly removed from her eyes.
Why had ehe allowed the New Woman's
Club' to distort her views until for
months she had not known herself? But
this man knew her; yes, knew her. and
that to despise her. Ah! that wasV thÂ«
bitter ehame of It all! Why had she bo'
rashly vowed that night of the ball to
teach herself to love this man and be
loved by him in return? But these were
questions beyond answers, and her head
fairly ached and swam with the calamity
her misdeeds had wrought.
Then a -strange, yes. a very strange
thing happened, "The gentleman from In
diana" kneeled down, and, drawing the
golden head against his own dark, cheeks,
said, while a tender light stole into bis
eyes :
"My method has been a cruel one. but
my darling has profited by It, so forgive
me." and the rest of the earnest entreaty
was caught only by Nellie herself.^who
laughingly cried:

A minute later the hopper was rrplacc<i

his pipe as he did so. Hardly had he be

"Nein â Ja!" was the laconic reply..
Without addressing themselves further
to -the seemingly stupid old German, the
Frenchmen began their search. Every

in the fruitless effort, with .1 cre^Uallen

him pouring corn Into the hopper. For

Several days after it had been noised
throughout the valley that th<* Little
Corporal had crossed the Rhine the old
miller was seated In a big armchair, re
flrciing over the turn which events had
taken. His ever-present pipe was between
his teeth, and he had Just filled 1t when
the round of furioup lioofi>eats coming in
his direction attracted his attention, and
a moment later a man hurled hlmsrll
from a horse, gave the anim.il a kick
which FT.t it galloping on. ajul rushed
into the mill. "Few God's sake, Mdn
Herr." he tried, "hide me in a safe place.

Joharn puffed so rapidly that ir.s head
was soon enveloped In a cloud of smoke :
then he removed the stem from between

"Wait cne minute."
When the rumor came that Napoleon,
the terror of Europe, was preparing to In
vade Germany, Johann was among the
first to hear of it. He puffed a little
harder at his p!pÂ«, and perhaps his blue
eyes blinked a trifle more when he
thought that the old mill where he had
labored for so many years would soon t>e
In ashes. Perhaps a tear glistened in his
eye as he dwelt upon It; but It was not
on account of himself or the loss which
he knew he would suffer. He was think

prove false; but subsequent new* con

eURLEIGH was loafing in Phila
delphia, en route to Paris. He had
finished dinner and was moodily
sipping his cordial and smoking a
Turkish cigarette. He felt that he had
mnde a complete ass of himself. He
crJlcd the waiter.
"There Is a train for New York
shortly?"
"At 8:30. sir."
"Here, fix up my bill at the desk and
have some one put my things in a cab."
Burleigh was reflecting on his. to say
the least, idiotic conduct of that after
noon.
To be brief, he had' fallen in love with
a girl whom he had never seen before.
She was pretty, of course, and when she
stepped from her carriage and went past
Burleigh Into Wanamaker's she was ab
solutely unconscious 'of the sudden flutter
In his heart.* . - . '
Poor Burleigh! Like the sleeping Ro
man soldier, who dreams through whole
campaigns, even while the water 13 drop
ping from his dipper, he was building nir
or.ptles of conquests even while shei trip
rrd across the sidewalk before him.
The girl was accompanied by an el
derly lady; possibly her mother, and the
stricken Burleigh followed them Into the
store.
It was difficult to keep sight of them in
this great mass of skeltering shoppers.
They made a few purchases and finally
wont to the art department:
There was a picture, by some French
man, on exhibition, and the girl anil her
mother took a seat and devoutly admired
It. Burleigh got a place where he could
pee the girl, and he devoutly admired her.
His faculties toppled over each other- in
fuippressed admiration. If he could only
booome acquainted with her! Tie was not
entirely unknown in Philadelphia, and
surely he could rake up some mutual ac
quaintance .who would properly present
.him. But while he was languishing in
this one-sided love fever tho, pair left
-the room. Burleigh took after them. He
had an Impulse to accost them .under
some pretext. Fortunately they were too
<;ulck for him. and In a trice they were
again-. In, their carriage, being rapidly
driven away,' and poor., bereft Burleigh'
j-tood watching the . departure f rorh ,; hid
ppÂ«=t'of disadvantage on the sidewalk,
feeling like the man who arrives in time
to see the Pullman special full of other
..Invited -guests and champagne baskets,
etc., pull away from the depot on a di
rectors' junket.
.. Burleigh was resourceful and did not
,hfsitate a second. A, young chap standing
by hls> bicycle was Instantly pressed into
service.
"See. that carriage?" said Burleigh.
i "Yes. sir," said the boy.
g "Wei!, here's my card. I am stopping
bllng hands she unfastened the door and
ran up the avenue. "A man! A man:*
murmured Polly. "Oh. why don't Just
one man come?" But one was coming â
was turning the corner even then. Run
ning up to him, she said, almost breath
lessly:
"Oh. sir, there Is a burglar Inside!"
Without waiting to know more he dis
appeared In the doorway, pulling ofT hid
topcoat.
Then Polly looked up and down the ave
nue for another man. for Jack had not
been strong for weeks; he may need two
men. And now there was another man ap
proaching. She appealed to him In a most
hysterical manner to help catcbj that
burglar. Cigar was hastily thrown aside.
How gallant he was! *ie fairly leaped ti>
her rescue â or rather. Jack's. And there
within six feet of her, Crossing the street,
was an officer. With" high hopes now of
making 1 assurance doubly sure, she ran
across to him.
"Oh, comeâ come quickly! There Is a
burglar In our house!"
And with that, another patrolman. see-
Ing bis fellow officer start on a run toward
the house, followed him.
"Five men altogether! They have himâ
they must have himl" murmured Polly.
How Jack would tell In after days of tha
bravery of his little wife; how proud he
would be of her. These thoughts flitted
through her mind as with bated breath
and wide-open eyes she stood In the hall
below, clinging to the banisters. Strength
was fast leaving her. but she couM hear
the men talklnrc upstairs- and movlr.se
abou* She alone was downstairs, and If
the burglar was driven that way she must
be ready to hold fast to him until help
came.
With eyes fixed on the drawing-room
tains she waited, pprhaps he had cot
down and hidden In there amid the dra
peries. Polly was breathing so hard she
knew he could hear her. And how loudly
her. heart was beatingâ thump! thump!
thump! He must hear that. He should
not think she was afraid. Oh. no. she was
not frightened: only nervous, only Kv
erything was growing confused: the.l!;rhtÂ«
were becoming dimmer and dimmer.
There! the curtains were moving In the
darkened room before^fterâheâmustâbe
coming. â¢ -
"Polly!" Jack called. "Polly!" and back
to earth and it* dread burglar she tried
to struggle. "Polly, dear, don't call In
any ore else.- It \s orly Jane."
But Polly was In a little heap at the foot
of the stairs, unconscious, and there Jacic
found her rs he and the men came down.
The Joke died away on his lips as ho took;
the slender form up In his arms. Polly's
burglar had been a very real one to her.
and it was nfter the fever had abated and
she was well on the road to recovery ere
she was told, days after, *k>w Jane. thfÂ»
housemaid, whom her mistress thought in
bed fully two hours before, had sat up on
that never-to-be-forgotten night In thÂ«
kitchen below, trying to write a letter trÂ»
James, her faithful laddie In far off old
England,
for its return. I will call her."
The daughter soon came into the room,
and she thanke.i Burleigh in such a sweet
way that he was simply transported.
"We thought it was particularly unfor
tunate that we haJ lost it just now, as tha
artist, Mr. Som^bye. is to have aa exhibi
tion of his work and wished to Include
this." she paid.
To the bewitched Burlcigh her volco
sounded like tr.e tinkling of silver beils,
and she seemed even more beautiful to
day than when he first saw her. His trip
to Paris he immediately resolved to in
definitely postpone, and he concluded to
stay In Philadelphia until

he failed to notice.
They had talked prouably fifteen or
twenty minutes, and he began t,o think it
was time to leave, and still, with all of
his agility he had not been able to lea-1
up to an invitation to call on her. and hn
feit the pangs of despair. But suddenly
he was again filled with hope, for, of all
men, who In the world should walk into
the room but his old friend' Urumley â "the
man from Pennsylvania"'â his roommrito
at college. Well, there was mutual sur
prise, of course, and Burleigh was heart-
lly welcomed and properly presented a:i
around.
Brumley Invited him to" dinner that
night. Invited him to his club â in fact,
planned excursions and festivities enough
to last a week.
But three nights later, as Eurlelgh pared
the saloon deck of the Campania, far out
at sea. he wished he at least had a enpy
of that miniature â for when the introduc

and find out where thosÂ« people live and
I will, give you a dollar."
The boy may have beÂ«n suspicious, but
the promised reward fetched him, and .
away ho scurried after the carriage.
Burlelgh slowly walked back to his ho
tel and passed a rather miserable after
noon waiting for the boy. By the time
he had finished his dinner he had arrived
at the conclusion that he was nothing
short of a sentimental milksop. He would
cut short all of this nonsense and go oVter
to New York and take his steamer. The
boy. of bourse; had failed in his mission,
andâ well, he was glad of it.
He finished his cordial and cigarette and

had followed the carriage and the people
lived at "No. â Walnut street.
"Ye?." said Burleigh, "you have done
well. You may"â
"But," continued the boy, "as the ladies
were leaving the rarnaee the old one
dropped this," handing Burleigh a small
locket.
"Well," said Burlei&h, "why didn't you
return It to them?" ,
The bright boy hesitated and looked at
Burleigh with a suspicious twinkle In his
eye.
"Well," he said. "I jthoitRht that you
might \\ant to return It yourself."
Burleigh took the locket, the boy's fÂ«-e
was doubled and the waiter was told to
dismiss the cab.
I Well, we have got this far with the"
story, and our hero is busy with all kind3
of reflections as to how "fate had Intend
ed this girl for him" and arguments pro
and con as to the proper thing to do. Of
course, he knew whac was right â a mac
with even primitive gentility would imme
diately call a messeiu-er and send the
locket to Its owner. Burlegh knew this
very well; but all argument with himself
was abruptly cut short and the course
promptly settled by *iis reverently open
lrg the locket. Then debate was futile.
The locket contained a delightful little
miniature of the girl herself.
Then the scheme?, came thlcxt and tost
as to the most feasible way of meeting
the girl. The locket would surely be ad
vertised for in the papers and he might
take it back In person and thus i.ave some
opportunity of advancing his cause; but
they might simply thank himâ and then It
would end. Or ho mirrht have a copy
made of the miniature so then if he could
not get the girl he would derive some lit
tle consolation from her picture. *
Anyway, the next day at noon Burleigh
presented himself at No. â Walnut street.
He was a very swell looking chap and
was togged out In the latest things In the
way of clothes. The man at the door was
properly impressed, even if Burleigh did
show some little hesitation in stating hlj
mission.
In a short time the man was on his way
"upstairs with tb,e card and Burleigh waa
nervously awaiting In the parlor the crit
ical .moment. He did not waittlo'ng.
The old lady came the room with
Burleigh's, card In her hand and a dis
interested look on her face that was very
chilling to Burleigh and he bes-an to wish
he had Intrusted this affair to a mes
senger. .-- ,
The lady began: "Mr.â Ah!â Burleigh?"
And Burleigh Instantly started In: "Yes.
madam. They used to say of me that I
was so stupid that I could never find any
Â¦ thing, but yeayrday I upset all prece
dents by finding a pretty little locket,
which', I judge by the advertisement in
the paper this morning, must belong to
you."
The lady thawed Instantly. "Oh! how
delightful," she said. "How can we ever
sufficiently thank you? My daughter will
be so happy that we have recovered it.
We had Just received it from the artist a
few days ago.".
"It is/ indeed, a very charming minia
ture." â¢ Burleigh ventured to say as he
handed It to her. "And I presume it is a
portrait of your daughter?"
"Yes, and she will want to thank you
.And with a grim Fmile the old miller of

his teeth. Â¦ 'Â¦Â¦Â¦>
"Why, this nothing but. meal is!" ho.
cried, In tones Indicative of both vexation
and astonishment.
"Ach! forgot I to tell you. They're all
there â every piece of them. But they've*

Promptness Is. a^virtue of the French.
In precisely thirty minutes from the time
that they had departed they reappeared.
Dismounting, the officer entered the room
where Johann sat smoking and demanded
what had been promised of him. Without
removing his pipe from his mouth the old
man pointed to a sack setting on the
floor. The Frenchman 'seized it. untied
the string and emptied the contents out
'upon the floor.- ;';
the old man, sternly. "I have It promised,
and always KeeptI my word. But, th.x:,
again, shall they not have them." And

WASHINGTON, D. C. Nov. 10.â The Congress of the United States more than-a
year ago, upon the urgent representations of the Navy Department, authorized
the construction of three sheathed and coppered armored cruisers of the high
est class, but unfortunately so arranged the armor rfjucstion involved as to
prevent anything being -undertaken with the cruisers until the settlement of
thi* question. The Fifty-fifth Congress, realizing the necessity for still further in
creaetng this section of the navy, made provision for three more armored' cruisers.
The delay. in the cruisers first authorized, while imfortunate in a great many. ways,
has been productive of some good in making it possible to arrange (for all six 1 ves
selsâthe California, West Virginia, Nebraska, Itfaryiand,. Colorado fend South Da
kotaâ to be virtually of the same design, the three sheathed' and, coppered being
practically In no other respect different from the other-three vessels of the r same
class unsheathed.

Extreme draft at full load, about.26 ft. 6 Inches
In order that the vessels may have an effective steaming radius consistent with
their other qualities, provision has been ; made for a total* bunker, capacity of 2000
tons, a figure which Is understood to be materially greater than that of any similar
foreign vessels. The ships will be propelled by twiq screws, four-cylinder triple
expansion engines of 23,000 indicated horsepower. With the power thfis developed
(it is intended that the vessel shall be propelled at a speed of at least 22 knots per
hour.
The armament of each of these vessels will consist of four 8-inch guns, mounted
in pairs in two Hichborn electrically controlled, elliptical, balanced turrets, placed
on the middle line, one forward andone aft. On' the upper deck, at the corners of
the superstructure', there wiir.be four 6-inch; guns, mounted. In sponsons, one In each

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, .WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASHING
TON, Nov. 10.â Instead of proceeding without delay to Manila,
as originally contemplated by the President, the battleship
Kentucky is loitering In the Mediterranean. Much to the sur
"prise of officers not in the secrets of the Bureau of Naviga
tion, the Kentucky did not continue with dispatch to Port Said,
en route to Manila. . . A list . of the ship's movements Issued
by Rear Admiral Crownlnshleld, chief of the Bureau of Navi
gation, to-day announced that the battleship left Gibraltar for
Algiers, j Officials of the Navy Department Insist that no orders
have been given to the Kentucky to proceed to Turkish waters,
but when asked if It. Is proposed to direct her to proceed to
Smyrna or any other Turkish port, they decline to answer.
As a result of the President's re-election, it is known that
Secretary Hay proposes to adopt a vigorous policy In the mat
ter of. the settlement of the pending questions. The Turkish
Government has, with unfailing regularity, been promising
since last spring to pay the claims for indemnity presented in
behalf of missionaries, but when the time to keep Its promises
has arrived It has evaded them with a skill which Is peculiarly
Turkish. â¢ A proposition was made to pay the claims under
cover "of a contract' for warships to be placed In the United
States, but this was rejected by Secretary Hay. who has In
sisted from . the outset that they be settled in a. manner that
will satisfy the offended dignity of this country.
Officials are convinced that there is only one way of obtain
ing the* indemnity and that is by a naval demonstration. Tho
Kentucky Is the first battleship of the United States that has
ever visited Mediterranean waters and her presence at various
ports will have a good effect on the countries to which they
belong. 'It' Is believed that the moral effect of her presence
In Turkish waters will .do much toward accomplishing a set
tlement of the claims. It is likely that before the battleship
arrives at Algiers a. determination as u> her uae In the Turkish
question* will be reported by the administration.
BIG BATTLESHIP
FOR TURKISH PORTS
LONDON, Nov. 10.â South Africa threatens once more
to absorb public attention in Great Britain. Lord
Salisbury, in his speech at the Inaugural banquet ot
the Lord Mayor In the Guildhall last evening, held
out little hope of immediate pacification, and the- re
turn of Lord Roberts is still problematical and is certainly a
matter of weeks and perhaps months. One of these most seri
ously interested and best Informed as to the future of the bel
ligerent regions when asked by a correspondent what was go
ing to happen and how soon it would happen replied: "Unfor
tunately I am not a minor prophet." ) That voices the Govern
ment attitude. The Ministers have given up speculating as to
when poace will be thoroughly restored," ar.il. to use Lord Sal
isbury's phrase anent China, they are "waiting for the situa
tion to develop Itself."
Generals and regiments are returning, but others are con
stantly leaving to replace them. A recruiting depot is being
established In London to supply 1000 men for General Baden-
Powell's South African' police force and detachments are con
stantly going to Join the regiments in the Transvaal. In re
gard to Lord Salisbury's open references to the possibility ot
Great Britain being taken unawares by some foreign power,
this state of affairs In South Africa does not breed confidence
or contentment. In his Lordship's defense of the War Office
many people believe they saw open threats to Lord Wolseley.
and in the sharp retort to Lord "Wolseley's recent criticisms
Lord Salisbury drew attention to the forced silence in which
Lord Lansdcwne (the late Secretary of State for "War) was
obliged to stand criticism for the faults of the army officers.
He warred his hearers that If the criticism was persisted In
the time might come when his silence would be broken and thÂ»
onus laid heavily and publicly on the light shoulders, though
he deprecated having recourse to that.
A curious feature connected with the war was Mrs. Richard
Chamberlain's vigorous attack on the army hospitals befoiiÂ»
the Hospital Commission last week. The spectacle of this
somewhat extraordinary sister-in-law of the Colonial Secretary
sitting two hours before that grave body and teaching a man
like Justice Rohmer his business created no- little sensation.
But for the woman who took out to South Africa 300 hot water
tags and reorganized the charities, and who has the reputation
of being the only individual ever known to affect the Judgment
of the Chamberlain brothers, the task was comparatively light.
Lord Roberts, telegraphing from Johannesburg under data
of November 8. reports to the War Office as follows:
"General Kpox states that he takes no credit for the very
successful engagement of November 6, which was due In thÂ«
first instance to the determination of Le Gallals never to loso
touch with the enemy, and secondly, to the able way in which
Le Gallals handled the firing after Le Gallals and Ross were
wounded. . -
â¢. "Smith-Dorrien reports that the two days' fighting men
tioned was very hard. His force consisted of 230 mounted
troops from -the Fifth Lancers, his Royal Canadian Dragoons
and mounted' riflta. two .Royal Canadian Artillery guns, four
guns of the Eigljtyvfourth Battery and 300 infantry of the Suf
folk's andgnrooshires.
"The Boers were met soon after starting from Belfast and
hung on the front, flanks and rear until the Komati River was
reached, where they stood at a very strong position. From this
they were forced to retire by a wide turning movement by tho
Suffolksand the Canadian mounted troops around their flank.
All the first day Boer signal fires were lighted in all directions
and before morning they were strongly reinforced.
. , -"Our casualties the first day were six killed and twenty
wounded, chiefly of the Shropehlres, who fought splendidly.
The next day the Boers tried to seize the strong position on,
the bank of the Komati from which they were beaten oat
November 6. but were prevented by Colonel Evan3 with tha
Canadian*mounted troops and two of the Eighty-fourth's guns,
galloping two miles and seizing It In the nick of, time. ThÂ«
rear on the return march was defended by Colonel Lessard
with the Canadian Dragoons and two Royal Canadian guns
under Lieutenant Morrison.
"Smith- Donien says -no praise can bÂ« too high for thÂ« de
voted gallantry these troops showed In keeping oft the) enemy
from the Infantry convoys.
"In the afternoon Â«n event unprecedented In this war oc
curred, Â¦ when some j 200 mounted Eo*rs suddenly charged ths
rear guard to within seventy yards, when they were stopped
by the. Canadian Dragoons. During the fight sixteen Canadians
fell into the hands of the enemy, who treated them kindly and
released them after removing their own dead and wounded,
during which operation the Canadians were compelled to lla
on their faces in order that they might not see how heavily
the Boers had suffered. Our casualties were two killed and
twelve wounded." . . ..
SOUTHAMPTON. Nov. 10.-This dty was in gala attins to
day and thousands of visitors from London and elsewhere par
ticipated In the ceremony of conferring the freedom of the city
upon General Buller. " A civic and military escort led thÂ© way
to the scene. General Butler's carriage was deluged with flow
ers. Lady Buller accompanied General Buller. Replying to th<%
address on the ' presentation of the freedom of thÂ© city, th*
general exhibited great emotion and arraigned his critics vig
orously. He declared "that when the history of the war was
fairly written It. would be found that the British army ra. South
Africa had ' confronted "difficulties far greater than any army
operating against; an equally civilized enemy had ever previ
ously- experienced. He cited the Boers' superior range of

Captain Ncrman Smith, one of the survivors, wan the first

"The steamer Montlcello left St. Johns Friday morning at

eo strong as to cause any alarm. The, storm became heavier,
however, and after the steamer had passed Pelilo Passage It
was feared ehe was doomed,

Yarmouth; Kate Smith of Yarmouth, stewardess, and a col
ored girl, whose name I did not know.
"The women were got into the boat with' great difficulty.
the volunteers following and getting the boat away. The wind"
Â¦was Mowing inshore at the time and the boat was carried rap
idly toward the land. , : .
"When the boat got away they were preparing on board to
launch another, but I don't think It got away. I think all. the
r**t were lost. The first boat was rapidly driven ashore near
Pembroke, and on nearlng the land a gigantic wave struck it
and threw It upon the shore, smashing It to atoms. I found
myself on the beach, holding on to the grass."

changes about -the time of the beginning
of the '' new term or even sooner is very
probable. Attorney General Grlgg3, it is
understood, -will probably resign to re
sume his private law practice and private
business and personal reasons may lead to
the resignation of Secretary 61 the Navy
Long, though there is no member of the
Cabinet whose resignation the Presidert
Â¦would accept with more regret than that
of his Secretary of the Navy. If the Presi

pend largely upon his health. If he should
retire it is popsible that Postmaster Gen

In the Cabinet that can be predicted with

probability that he will stay longer. Ho

BERLIN, Nov. 10.â Lord' Sails- I
bury's Guildhall speech is com
mented on favorably by the
German press, especially the
passage anent the Anglo-Ger
man agreement, in which inferentiaily
Great Britain's pro-German sentiments j
are divulged. The British Premier's army |
reform references likewise meet with ap- t
proval and the hope is expressed that the
reform will be thorough. The passage '
touching upon the . United States was i
passed over Eilently by a majority of the !
papers. i
Interest in China i3 decidedly waning. j
This may be seen everywhere, in the press j
and in conversation.
Interest just now centers in the Reich
stag opening next week, which will be
particularly solemn. At noon, in the Rit
tersal of Berlin Castle, Wednesday, previ
ous thereto, there will be a divine ser
vice, both Catholic and Protestant. The j
press generally calls attention to the inr ]
portance of the forthcoming session whose '
ilrst part will deal with the Chinese pjl- :
icy. the Emperor's and the Government's !
hitherto comprehensive measures, includ-
Ing the creation of a rpecial China army, ;
which the Liberal press has been pointing i
to as unconstitutional. Furthermore, the
Reichstag will deal with the Posadowsky- '
Bueck matter, which will arouse heated
debates. The budget and bills referring
to Insurance companies, publishers' right.*, I
commerce and marine will also receive
attention. The Center party will again in
troduce a bill providing for the recall of
the Jesuits. The eecond part of the ses
sion of the Reichstag will probably not
begin before April. The first work win
be a revision of the tariff and a renewal
of the commercial treaties, on the prepar
atory work of which the Government
departments are still rar behind. Never
thelpss, agitation on the whole subject is
carried on vigorously throughout Ger
many, including the entire press and in
the Chamber of Commerce.
The Central Bureau for the preparation
of commercial .treaties to-day submitted
to Count von Bulow, the Imperial Chan
cellor, a very powerful Memorial, proving
the inadvisability of establishing maxi
mum and minimum tariffs.
The correspondent asked Dr. von Holle

has been accomplished and nobody knows
what the results will be."
The correspondent got a similar reply
from the United States Embassador. An

The press Is still devoting considerable
space to the results of the election in the

alleged fact that the United States intends

The National Zeitunx to-duv thoroughly
discusses the United States CongreHBlonal
projects for a Central American canal and
an increase of the United States navy,
classing both projects an being of im
mense interest to Germany. Thepap^r
also condemns the United States' alleged
intention to discontinue the building of
torpedo-boats. In apite of the North Ger
man Gazette's semi-official statement that
the German press, regardless of parly, re
ceived most favorably the news of Presi
dent McKinley's re-election, the truth in
that a large part of the press 1m com
menting hostilely and venomously on tiir
result. Jt is significant, for instance, that
the Cologne Volks Zeitung, the leading
organ of the Center party, which dom
inates the Reichstag, continues the mo?t
bitter comments, deploring President Mc-
Kinley's re-election as likely to re-engen
der in Washington a policy" unfriendly to
Germany. '\
The Sternberg trial Is still proceeding.
The press, in commenting on the Berlin
criminal police corruption, calls attention
to the extremely low salaries paid them,
high officials receiving barely $1000 to $200>j
yearly.
The latest reports show that the Offen
bach disaster was caused by the inat
tention of a switchman. The number of
dead is now twenty-one and 'thirty per
sons were seriously injured.
The correspondent learns on- reliable au
thority that Germany's negotiations with
the Turkish Government on the subject
of a coaling station at Farsan ate still
pending, but are likely to result favorably.
Count von Zuppelin In Berlin ls trying
to get the War Department to purchase

Emperor William's barber, Â¦ Francois
Haby, the Inventor of his Majesty's style
of mustache, recently ventured to remark
"What does your Majesty think of
China?"
This so ruffled the Emperor's temper
that, taking Haby by the ear. he escorted
the barber from his chamber. The Inci
dent has been laughed at throughout Ber
lin.
It was announced May last that it was
frequently remarked during the festivi
ties that his Majesty's mustache was no
longer "turned upward eo fiercely as for
merly, but was worn at an angle of 45 de
grees only, with the ends no longer
spreading out proudly."
It was added that it ww a fact that the
Emperor had abandoned his former fash
ion of wearing his mustache, although all
male Germany adhered to it, one reason
being the dismissal of Haby, who had
"become impudent and had. presumed to
trade upon his alleged friendly relations
with tho*Emperor."

THE INTRUSION
OF SVORDRUP
American Lieutenant Inclined
to Consider Frozen Ground
His Own for Exploring
Purposes.
Â» f
EDINBURGH. Nov. 10.â It now
transpires that Dr. Leopold
Karm is the only. member of his>
party of Arctic scientists who
arrived at Dundee yesterday on
the whaler Ec'ispe from Davis Strait. Dr.
Robert Stein cf the United States Geo
logical Survey, decided at the eleventh
hour not to come to Scotland, but to await
the first opportunity of boirg landed on
the American side. Samuel Warmbath ot
Boston preferred to remain at Cape Sa
bine for a time.
In an interview to-day Dr. Kann gave
some Interesting deiails regarding the
Peary and Svordrup expeditions.
"Lieutenant Peary's party," he said,
"passed the winter at Etah, on Smiths
Sound, near the spot where Dr. Hays had
his winter quarters in 1&G0. and not far
from the Kcene of the Grct-ly disaster.' In
February and March of this year Fort
Magnesia, our winter house at Bedford,
on Pyra Island, was thrice visited by. the
members of his expedition. On the flre=t
occasion Mr. Har.sen's party came, on the
second a party under Dr. Diedench ana
later Lieutenant Peary himself. In com
mand of a slc-djrir.g party. He reported
that about ten months previously he had
met Svordrup in theKane Basin, north, of
Smiths Sound. From tho conversation I
elicited that seme feeling nad been en
gendered betwetn Lieutenant Peary and
Svordrup, tho former rather resenting
what he considered the latter's intrusion
Into ground which, for exploring purposes.
the American was inclined to regurd as
his own. . â¢
â¢'Svordrup'!? party had thoroughly ex
plored the E2!e?mere Hinterland, mapping
out a region that was hitherto a blank oa
the charts. Many of Svordrup's flags
â¢were seen by us.
"When the Peary and Svordrup parties
separated Svordrup's understood intention
â¢wae to explore the vast area of lar.d ami
water in and around Jones Sound, lx-yond
Cape Eden. 1 believe Svordrup. on the
Fraxn. is now wintering in Jones Sound
end my opinion, which is backed by that
of the Dundee whalers, is that it will be
impossible for the Fram to come home
this year. The autumn hat, been very
tempestuous and the ice was such as to
render navigation next to impossible.
"Lieutenant Peary had 'JX> dogs and
twenty-seven pledges, but. having under
rated the difficulties of the journey an3
not having a sufficiency of food, most oi
his dogs died. He kept only a few natives
at Fort Conger during the summer sp-a*on
e.nd the rest of the Esquimaux with Lieu
tenant Peary returned to the settlement
In a few days, so that the journey was
txtremely arduous and the party suffered
gr^at hardships.
"I am certain that Lieutenant Peary is
now wintering- at Fort Conger. When I
left Cape York, on the Eclipse, June 9,
the Windward was expected . to touch
there about the middle of July, where
orders from Lieutenant Peary, which I
had brought, were left with the Esqui
maux.
"Dr. Stein and myself discovered a mel
ancholy record of the Svordrup expedition
near Fort Magnesia, in the grave of Dr.
Svenfisden. with the inscription, 'Died

LONDOX. Nov. 10.â The death of
the Maharajah of Patialia at
Simla November 8 removes one
of the the best and most Inter
esting products of Anglo-Indian
rule. He was the first reigning Prince to
blend the elements of the English gentle
man and Indian potentate. Educated at
Cambridge, he returned to India and put
in force in his rich kingdom the reforms
which he had carefully absorbed in Eng
land, endowing free hospitals for women,
ostablishing orphanages, drilling troops,
sending them to help a British expedition
and leading them personally. It was one
of his keenest disappointments not to be
allowed to serve in South Africa. But he
was not only a just and enlightened ruler.
He became the best polo player in India,
was a fearless r!der,. a dead shot, was sec
end only â¢ to Ranjitsinjb.1 at cricket and
was one of the finest amateur billiardlsts
of the day. The deceased was a close
friend of Lord William Beresford, Lord
Roberts and other well-known people. He
was passionately fond of horses and Im
ported a splendid stud and an Irish ex
pert named Bryan to be master of
horse at Patialia. With Bryan went his
daughter, and the Prince fell desperately
in love with her, proposed and was ac
cepted.
.The Sikhs murmured and threatened re
volt and the Imperial Government, dread-
Ing evil, resolved to break off the match.
But Great Britain and his. own, subjects
were outwitted and eventually appeased,
the bride embracing the Sikh faith. Her
reign was short. Accompanying her hus
band during a campaign In the Icy
Himalayas, she died of pneumonia. At
the head of his silent army the Prince
brought the body back hundreds of miles
to Patiala. where the remains were cre
mated with the Sikh rites, which this
week were accorded to himself.
The determination of the American steel
manufacturers to invade these markets
is not apparently bothering the English
trade to any great extent, judging frqm
the opinions of the master cutler of Shef
field, the head of one of the greatest steel
organizations in the country, who said
to a correspondent:
"I do not believe American trade in
steel rails in England will amount to
much. Every manufacturer gets a cer
tain surplus which, if he can find a mar
ket, can make a clear profit. We are get
ting the American surplus and believe
they are selling cheaper than in their
own country. When such competition
becomes serious it will be necessary for
the American manufacturers to devote
more than their surplus to the market.
When t!,Â£y do I believe they will find they
cannot 'beat us in prices or quality on our
own '^Tound. Business here is as good
as Â«jver and promises to remain so. 1
Â¦cannot say we have yet felt the pinch of
AvnerlcaTi rivalry."; ' ' â¢ ,' * "
/Mr. Thornycroft, the English torpedo
boat builder, has been expressing inter
esting opinion on submarine boats. He
does not believe it necessary for Great
Britain to build submarine boats, even if
the experiments of other nations have
been quite successful. He is certainly
studying the problem of devising a sub
marine destroyer, should It ever be neces
sary. He regards the American sub
marine boat as the best type yet made.
But he doubts its efficacy, even for har
bor defense.
."A shell dropped in the neighborhood of
a submarine boat." said Mr. Thornycroft.
"and exploded either level -with or below
!t would afford sufficient shock to crumple
up the boat. Possession of a submarine
boat of our own will not help you tb find
an enemy. They are at present of too
limited range and insufficient propelling
power to be really a perlous factor, and
the unsatisfied problem of keeping a level
keel under water is yet io be solved. If I
ever have to go under water with a sub
marine boat I will prefer to sit outside."
In spite of the pessimism of Mr. Thorny
croft the Admiralty has at last decided to
grant a submarine boat, designed by a
Howard of Tasmania, an official trial.
One of the most interesting- house par
ties of the -week was that of Lady Fermer-

States is Mrs. Mackay.
A novel feature of the Lord, Mayor's
banquet was the appearance of the
Mayors of newly created boroughs of Lon
don. The titles sounded strange, but the
Idea seems to meet with g-eneral approval.
Among the new Mayors of London are
two Dukes, one Earl, four members of the
House of Commons and two Knights. The
Duke of Norfolk was elected first Mayor
of Westminster. Earl Cardigan Mayor of
Chrlsea and the Duke of Bedford Mayor
of Holborn. With such aristocratic heads
the new City Hall may. It is believed, bid
fair to rival the Mansion House.
PEKING, Nov. 9.â The Chinese Peace
Commissioners, having urged the Dowager '
Empress Â¦ to execute immediately Yu
Hsuen, Governor- of Shensi Province, and
General Tung Fuh Slang, as proof of the
good intentions of the Government to pun
ish adequately those officials who art
most responsible" for* the anti-foreign atro
cities, a reply has come from the court
that the utmost sentence for Yu Hsuen
will be banishment and that as the couri
is now. in the power of Tung Fuh Siang's
troops. It Is impossible to punish Tung
Fuh Slang at all. It will require firm
pressure from the powers to secure* the
punishment of these two detestable crim
inals, but rebellion now raging in the
south, having for Its declared purpose the
expulsion of the Manchu dynasty and the.
establishment of one purely Chinese, will
soon compel the* Dowager to yield to all'
the .demands of "the powers' and make
peace with the "foreign devil" to escape
the deep sea of revolution in the empire.
Although the Ministers allirm that their
meeting was perfectly harmonious, th<^y
practically agreeing upon all the questions
egnsidered, they have not yet proceeded
beyond the most elementary, subjects. The
question or Indemnity, tor instance, was
not even discussed. It is of such magni
tude that they seemingly are desirous oi
putting off its consideration as long as
! possible and the negotiations are Uitcly.
i to be greatly protracted before unythinR
I will be ready to present to the Chinese
plenipotentiaries. The present desires of
the Ministers is tlrst to contract a prelim
inary treaty acknowledging a. few princi
ples, such as indemnities and the securi
ties for the future of the lives and prop
i erty of foreigners, leaving the other
questions to be negotiated separately by
each power. There is every probability
that the negotiations will last for years.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 10.â In, order to
expedite the conclusion Â¦ of the negotia
tions In progress at Peking. Secretary
j Hay has sent instructions to Mr. Conger,
authorizing him to make concession^ not
affecting the maintenance of the inttprity
of China and the "open door."" 5 '
Delay; it is believed by the administra
tion, will give rise to developments Which
may be seized upon by the foreign pow
ers as pretexts for the dismemberment of
China. As stated in Tho Call thla morn
ing the Secretary has made representa
tions to foreign governments urging them
to Instruct their representatives in .Peklns
to make concessions which will enable an
agreement to be promptly reached. The
| Secretary has put into practice what he
i has preached, and Mr. Conger, in a mem
i orandum he will present to the diplomatic
I corps at a meeting to be held to-morrow,
will show conclusively that the United
States is willing to make concessions
whÂ«*re they do not injuriously affect the
principles of the integrity of Ch|na and
! the "open door," for which this country
has always contended.
The meeting to be held to-morrow will
be important in demonstrating whether
any of the powers are purposely delaying
a satisfactory solution.
A suspicion has arisen that this is the
case, but there is no proof, and it may
either be confirmed or dissipated by the
results of to-morrow's session. It is un
derstood here that the diplomats In Peking
! are acting 1 in accordance with instructions
I sent them by their governments, and the
! latter and not the Ministers are rc?ponsi
j ble for the delay. The character of the
instructions sent to Mr. Conger has not
been made public, the State Department
going on <the theory that it would be in
advisable to do bo at this time. It is
known, however, that if the remainder of
the diplomatic corps insists upon the de
capitation of Prince Tuan Mr. Conger v.-iil
{ agree to it in order to bring about fin end
' to a discussion of this feature of the ne
| gotiations. Other concessions of a like
I nature have been made, the hope beintr
] that this attitude will have a good effect
! upon the representatives of the other na
i tions.

cure. for obstinate stomach trouble. She
says: "I had poor digestion nearly all

almost resembled spasms.

to try Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.

after each meal and found them delight-
ful to take, being as pleasant to the tasle

been suffering since early last summer.
Mrs. Dun survives him.
Robert Graham Dun had been a promi

nearly half a century. Mr. Dun had been
associated with the agency sine* 1S51. In
1S54 he became a partner and in 1809 pur
chase the entire Interest, since which
time his name has been at the head of the
firm, which has a world-wide reputation.
When Mr. Dun first became connected
with the business it waa In its infancy.
Its wonderful development and growth
are due largely to his individual effort
and untiring application to the ever-in
creasing de-tails of management.
Mr. Dun's ancestors -were Scotch. HJs

The third article in the will reads: "I
pive. devise and bequeath to my brother.
Charles Pearcy. of Chicago. III., *5Q,(*iO."
It is under this article that Haffner
makes hi? claim to a share of the B'.ythe
estate. So far as known the name of
Charles Pearcy was never before men
tioned in the litigation since the death of
Blythe. It is on record, however. In the
Probate Court of Cook County. 111., that
Charles Pearey died at the West Side
Hospital, Chicago. November. 1S37.
The papers in the possession of HafTner
were yesterday turned over to Lawyer E.
B. Southworth of 120 Broadway, who has
been retained by Haffner to press his
claim to a share of the vast estate.
The docunfer.ts supplied by Haffner. If
their authenticity can be establlsned, will
set at naught the iitisavion of years and
start afresh the bitter contest over the old
man's millions. They include what pur
ports to be the original will of "â¢James
Hey Pearcy, otherwise known as Thomas
H. Blythe," dated March 4, 1SS1. signed in
the presence of Haffner and one Joseph
Blow, late of Los Angeles. Cal. This will
appoints Haffner executor of the estate,
without bonds, and names as residuary
legatee "my adopted daughter. Miss Flor

SAN RAFAEL. Nov. 10.â Three un
marked graves, one covered with freshly
spaded earth, were found by Isaac Smith
of this city while quail hunting yester
day on the bushy hillside that rises above
a Chinese fishing camp on the northern
side of Point San Pedro. Coroner Eden
of this city has no knowledge that will
throw light upon the identity of the dead
that lie burled there, how they met death
or when and by whom they were In
terred.
The graves He In one of the most deso
late portions of the point. No road runs
near them, and only a winding trail used
by Chinese shrimp fishers Is the only,
means of approach by land, unless one
tramps a quarter of a mile over rugged
hills and through the thick brush that
He to the west. The mysterious gravt-s
are about 300 yards from shore on the
rounding- face of a steep hill. Near the
shore and oft to the left about a stone's
throw lies a small fishing village, with Its
cosmopolitan population of ducks, dogs
and Chinamen. Upon two of the graves
green grass Is growing and they would
hardly attract the notice of a passer-by, â¢
but on the third the freshly turned soil is
barren of all vegetation. Twenty feet
from the graves and carefully stowed
away In the underbrush Mr. Smith found
two 12-foot scantlings, the ends of -which
had been carefully planed and rounded
to afford a better grip to the hand. Their
nearness to the graves gave them a lit
ter-like appearance, and the small end
of a burned candle found under them in
the leaves occasioned the belief that they
were used when the daylight had gone.
The Ban Pedro fishing camps are a,
small province of China as 'far as the
customs and mode of life of their ever
changing population are concerned. The
white man's world knows little of what
transpires within their bounds. From
time to time rumors of battles and blood
shed among warring factions of the fish
ermen have come to this city, but as
evidence never came with them the offi
cials here let them pass as rumors only.
The finding of these graves will probably
result In a full and thorough investiga
tion.
It has long been known here that the
highbinder wars In San Francisco have
sent many a hunted Celestial to the fish
eries to escape from foes or the officers.
As marked men with prices upon their
heads they have gone into hiding among
the Bhrlmp camps. It is not regarded
here as improbable that thp bodies 'n
the San Pedro graves may bear the t1*Â»
ble marks of the hatchet or the cluo. L.u.st
fall Edward "Watson of this city,, while
attempting to take the census of the
camps, was threatened by a large num
ber of the Mongols and was compelled to
seek safety In flight.
Coroner Eden will open the graves and
see If they contain the bodies of China
men or whitÂ© men.

Hypnotism is no longer a myth, a fanciful creation of the. mind, but a real-
ity, a most potent power, capable of producing Infinite good. For the purpos* of
ascertaining the exact value of this much talked of power a committee composed
of a pnysldan, a well-known Jurist, a prominent minister and a leading railroad
man was appointed to investigate Hypnotism.
The committee carried on a series of Investigation* In regard to the power of
hypnotism to Influence the actions and deeds of people in thÂ© every day walks of
life.
The first step taken by the members of thÂ© committee was to master the
Bdence in every detail, so that they might state from personal experience the
good or evil this strang-e power might produce. They wrote the New York Insti-
tute of Science, of Rochester, N. Y. t the greatest school of Hypnotism and Oc-
cult Sciences in the world, and received full and complete Instructions In regard
to how hypnotism may be used to Influence people In business, how to usÂ« it In
treating diseases, etc.. etc. In a few days they mastered these Instructions and
â¢were fullaedged hypnotists.
It -was clearly demonstrated that hypnotism may be employed bo that the per-
son operated upon Is enflrely unconscious of the fact that he la belns Influenced;
and. all things considered, the committee regard It as the most valuable discov-
ery of modern times. A knowledge of It la essential to one's success in life and
well belngr in society.
Dr. Lincoln says, after a thorough Investigation, that he considers It the most
marvelous therapeutic or curative aerent of modern times.
Judge Schafer. although a legal light, turned his attention to healing the sick,
end in a few treatments he completely cured John E. Myers of Flemington. N. J.
of a strange malady that bad kept him bedfast for nine years, and which the doc-
tors said must surely kill him. Judge Schafer's fame spread for miles around and
hundreds of people applied, to him for treatment-
Mr. Stoufer performed the astonishing feat of hypnotizing Mr. Cunningham of
Pueblo. Colo., at a distance of several blocks. He also hypnotized an aged gen-
tleman and had him run through the 6treets shouting "R*dhot peanuts for sale."
Mr. Etoufer says it is indispensable to one's business success.
Rev. Paul Weller cays that every minister and every mother should under-
stand hypnotism for the benefit they can be to those with whom they are brought
in daily contact.
In speaking of this marvelous power President Eilot of Harvard College said
to the graduates: "Young gentlemen, there Is a subtle power lying latent In each
of yon which few of you have developed, but which, when developed, might make
a man Irresistible. It is called Personal Magnetism, or Hypnotism.- I advise you
to master it."
The New York Institute of Science has JuM Issued 10.000 copies of a book which
fully explains all the secrets of this marvelous power and gives explicit directions
for becoming a practical hypnotist," so that you can employ the- force without
the knowledge of any one. Anybody can learn. Success guaranteed.
The book also contains a full report of the members of the committee. It
will be seat absolutely freÂ« to any one who is interested. A postal card will
bring it.

All doubt as to the identity of the men
who attempted. to crack the safes In the

and the office of the Pacific Rolling Mills
on Mission street recently was removed
yesterday when Marshal ChubbuCk" of
Chlco came to the city and showed Cap
tain Seymour some of the tools found In
the valises of Clarence French and
Charles Tessler, the ex-convlcts arrested
there for burglary..
Most of the tools had been stolen from
the Pacific Tool and Supply Company
First and Mission streets, but others were
identified as having been stolen from the
Brooks-Follis Company and the' Pacific
Rolling Mills Company at the time of the
attempts to crack their safes. Captain
Seymour is also satisfied that the two
men broke open the safe at the grocery
on Fifth and Mission streets, as the marks
on the safe and doors fit the tools found
upon them. They were held to answer
Friday for the burglary, of a hardware
store mlChlco and are now in the Orovllle
jail awaiting their trial, but If they are
not convicted Seymour will bring them
here, as he has at least three good cases
against them. - :

Attorney General Tirey L. Ford has sub
mitted to tha Governor his biennial re
port covering thÂ© work of the office of
Attorney General from September 1. 189tf,
to September Ij 1900. In his letter ot trans
mission accompanying, his report tha At
torney General calls attention to the im
mense volume of business transacted by
his office durlns the last two yeaxs.
â¢The .civil business of tha office has
grown to unusual proportions and coverÂ»
an exceedingly wide range. Out of be
tween eighty and ninety civil cases pend
ing the Attorney General specially refert.
to a number of the most Important ones,
among- which are the Stanford Inheritance
tax case; wherein some 3250,000 was saved
to the school fund of tha State; Sponagle
vs. Curnow, Involving the insanity law : of
1897; the bond tax case, involving thn
right of the State. to tax bonds of, rail
road and other quasi public corporations;
Yolo vs. Colgan, involving about a mil
lion and a half dollars claimed by t'ue
various counties against the State; peopie
vs. Wells. Fargo & Co., Involving the
right of the express company to demand
the 1-cent revenue from each shipper for
eacn package forwarcfed by express; peo
ple vs.. Curry, involving the submission of
constitutional amendments; Smith vs.
Keevos, involving taxes of Atlantic and
Â¦Pacific Railroad Companv; Railroad Com
missioners vs. Market Street Railway
(ornpany, involving jurisdiction of the
Railroad Commission over street rail
roads; Railroad Commissioners vs. South
ern Pacific Company, known as the "KrÂ«?b
no rate-case," involving authority of the
hallroad Commission to prevent the rais
ing of rates previous! v lowered for com
petitive purposes, and a number of others.
Continuing the Attorney General says:
These" case's will' serve to' Illustrate the variety
and magnitude of the civil litigationâ and there
arc never less than eighty or ninety cases j'end
lnrâin which the interests of the State are
represented by this office.
The task which is allotted to this office will
be the better appreciated when it la remembered
that In the foregoing cases, as in many others,
we were compiled to contend against the
1-ower of private and corporate wealth and the
skill and learning of the leaders of the Cali
fornia bar. The success,- therefore, which has
etime to the State in these matters la exceed
ingly Kratifying. .'
It may not be amiss to here call attention -to
tbe fact that In the matter of money Judgments
during the twenty months since 1 assumed of
fice there has been recovered against the State
but one judgment, and that in the small sum
of *ISS 33. while Judjnnents In r.ivor of the State
reprt-sent the sum of nearly $3C0,0C0.
After referring to "leave to sue" case3
and "escheated estates" the Attorney
General reviews the department of "crim
inal appeals," and among other things
says:
From the fifty-seven counties of ths State
there come to this office an average of over
slrt criminal app^aU per month, or about one
and a half per week, some of them pr*sentins
questions of the jtravest character and all of
them demanding prompt and constant atten
tion. - â¢ '. . .;
Special reference is- made to the HuCf
and Botkin cases. â . . - : -,
Concerning "opinions and consultations'

forty of the fifty-seven District Attorneys in
the State. > . '
The 'opinions thus rendered cover the many
and complicated questions constantly arising In
the administration of the affairs of a great and
growlnc State. Statutory construction has en
tered into much of this branch of the work
and constitutional questions have not Infre
quently arisen. Fully one-fourth of the work of
the office is covered by the preparation and
transmission of opinions.
The work of the Attorney General upon
the State Board of Examiners is sot forth,
Bhowinp action upon some ten thousand
separate claims," involving a little over
seven and a half millions of dollars; also
his work upon the State Commission In
Lunacy and the State Board of Military
Auditors.
A new. not to eay novel, -feature of the
report consists of the reports of forty out
of the fifty-seven District Attorneys of
the State. Concerning these the Attorney
General says:
Some interesting statistical data are derivable
from these reiiort!Â«. and a reading of them
will disclose a highly satisfactory condition
in this branch of the State's service.
It will be noted that out of a total of over
2300' felony prosecutions in the forty counties
from which reports have been received leas than
13 per cent of them resulted in acquittals.
As illustrative of the vast amount of
work devolving upon his clerical help,
which he states is inadequate, the Attor
ney General says:
During the twenty months ending September
1. 1300. the clerical force of this office wrote
4817 official communications, and .420 opinions,
the Utter alone covering some 2000 pages of
typewritten matter. Additional copies of opin
ions have been made to the extent of about
500 pages. Some-fifty briefs* have been writ
ten in civil cases, Involving, in the aggregate,
about 1200 pages, and eighty briefs have been
written in criminal cases, involving about 800
pages. In addition to the above, there, has
been the stenographic work Incident to the
large mass of civil businesn . constantly pend
ind. which Is never less than 85 cases.
The Attorney General concludes as fol
lows: Â¦ t.
In conclusion I beg: to state that the work
of this office is all current and that it has
been my .policy to constantly keep it so. This
at times has been difficult, particularly in view
of the lack of, clerical assistance, but by
methodical and- systematic arrangement we
have prevented any of the work from lagging
behind. .
I desire to further add' that the gratifying
results herein briefly suggested could not have
been accomplished but for the cordial and ener
getic aM of able and industrious assistants.
I cannot here well refer in detail to the work
of those â¢ with -w,hom I have b?Â«n officially as
toclated during the twenty months pant, but 1
desire to make this public acknowledgement of
my deep and abiding: sense of gratitude for
their loyal and earnest support and their un

OF HIS OFFICE
XETVPORT NEWS, Va.. Nov. 10.â The
monitor Arkansas -was launched at the
shipyard to-day. The event was very suc
cessful. Miss Bobbie Newton Jones,
daughter of Governor Jones of Arkansas,
christened the monitor as It started down
the ways. In addition to Governor Jones
and a party of Arkansans, there were
present Governor Tyler of Virginia, a
large party of naval officers and a number
of invited guests.
The monitor Arkansas is the first of a
type developed by the American navy, for
not since the days of the Civil "War has a
single turreted monitor been constructed. ,
The Arkansas will nave as sister ships
the Florida and the Wyoming and a
third, which was to have been the Con
necticut, still unnamed. These are known
as harbor defense monitors, and while
small will have large accommodations for
crews for vessels of their size, and also
be for the use and instruction of the na
val militia. . -
The Arkansas is -to cost not more than
J1.500.0O) complete. The designs, were pre
pared by Chief Constructor Hlchborn and
provide for a single balance turret of the
Hlchborn type on the center line forward,
with an inclined top. and made of steel
nine inches thick. This turret will con
tain two of the new high power 12-ineh
breech-loading rifles. Besides this arma
ment, the Arkansas will carry four 4-inch
rapid-fire guns, three 6-pounders and four
l-pounders. A special effort was made to
secure light draft for this formidable tvpe
of vessel, so the Arkansas when complete
will draw only 12 feet 6 inches of water
on a displacement of 3233 tons, enabling
her to slip into any harbor open to sea
going shipping. Eleven inches of steel
armor protects the sides above the water
line, and there is a protective deck for
the full length of the vessel 1% inches
thick. Twin screw engines will drive the
monitor at a maximum speed of eleven
knots, amply sufficient for a harbor de
fense vessel, and electricity will be em
ployed for turret turning gears, ammuni
tion hoist, ventilating apparatus and all
the secondary machinery. All the wood
in the vessel is fire proof. Unlike the old
type of monitors, the Arkansas will have
staterooms above deck for the officers and
crew, but the superstructure has been so
designed that It will not affect the ship
should the superstructure be destroyed in
action, thus retaining the virtue of the
monitor principle.

The article published in last Sunday's
Call that Frank P. Haynes, collector ot
delinquent taxes, was about to begin
about 30,000 actions agalr.st personal prop

suits are for the collection of a slight
increase in the tax rate of 1808 over that
of 1897, the taxes having been collected
at the rate fixed for (he last named year.
Assessor Dodge agrees .with Tax Col
lector Scott that the statute on the sub

Dodge urges the passage of an act by the
Legislature to remedy the oppressive way
of collecting a few cents delinquent taxes.
Yesterday he issued tilt, following state

An act approved March 28, 1895, Imposed the

atlon for State, county and city purposes can
not be fixed , until September, and is seldom
alike, and tho valuation made by the Assessor
is subject to a flat increase by the State Board
of Equalization, it follows that the amount
collected by the Assessor can never be the
exact amount of taxes.
The chapter, .article IV, chapter S, section 3,
requires the Tax Collector to appoint an attor
ned to prosccuto actions to collect delinquent
taxes. Thus it happens that a delinquent tax
of 4 cents caused cither by the raise of valua
tion by the State Board of Equalization, or a
change In either the State or city rate of tax

of the tax which is paid to the attorney for
collecting if the amount of the taxes Is raised.
MBS. CBAVEN DEMURS TO
PEHJUBY INDICTMENT
The "Document Filed Before Judge
Cook and Argument Is Set for
December 8.
Attorney T. D. Riordan yesterday filed
a demurrer In Judge Cook's court to the
indictment charging Mrs. Nettie R.
Craven with perjury. Mrs. Craven was
in court, attended by a nurse, and looked
In much better health and spirits than on
her last appearance a week ago. She is
still using her crutches.
The demurrer is brief and alleges that
the indictment does not substantially
conform. to the requirements of sections
050, Ml and 952 of the Penal Code; that
the facts stated do not constitute a pub
lice offense and that the indictment con
tain? matters which, if true, would con
stitute a legal justification and legal ex
cuse of the offense charged and a legal
bar to the pros'ecution. On these grounds
the defendant claims to be dismissed.
After the demurrer had been read it was
agreed that the argument of counsel
thereon* should be heard December 8.

the Oakland Republican Alliance to de
liver the banner next Saturday night at
the Union League Club's rooms at the
Palace Hotel.
The directors authorized President
Booth to appoint a committee of three to
arrange details. He appointed Tirey L.
Ford, W. M. Abbott and D. E. McKinlay.
The committee will meet Monday after-
The directors decided that the Bear Club
and -Phoenix Club be invited to act as es
cort to the Oakland Alliance in its march
from the ferry depot to the Palace Hotel.
Since the transfer of the banner is not
to be made part of a general jollification
meeting those who are anxious to see a
meeting at which the Republican landslide
will be duly celebrated are urging the
State and county committees to take that
matter in hand.
PAVING OF DOWNTOWN
STREETS BEC03OTENBED
Board of Works Requests Supervisors
to Improve Grant Avenue â Alta
Theater Condemned.
The Board of Public Works met yester
day and adopted resolutions asking for j
permission to improve, under guarantees
of maintenance for ten years, Sacramento â¢
street, from Montgomery to Battery,
â¢with bituminous rock or basalt, on a foun- I
dation of cobbles, at an estimated cost of |
$3077; Clay street, from Montgomery to !
Battery, same material, cost $3120; Pine J
street, from Sansome to Battery, cost |
521 H3.
The board recommends the paving- of ;
Grant avenue, from O'Farrell to Bush ,
street, except those portions already j
paved. The cost is c&tirhated at $7087. !
1^500 of which will be paid by the property |
owners. The Grant Avenue Improvement i
Club petitioned for the work.
The construction of bunkers for street ;
sweepings on the lot at Eleventh and Bry- !
ant streets at a cost of $55o5 was also rec- !
omroended. . Â¦ j
At a joint meeting of the Boards of I
Works and Fire Wardens yesterday after
noon a resolution was adopted requesting |
the Board of Supervisors to pass an or- ;
dlnance condemning the Alta Theater and \
ordering its immediate closing. The build- :
ing is regarded by the two first named ,
boards as being: dangerous to human life. \
The Alcazar Theater will be required to i
have its curtain roll from the top instead
of the bottom in order that metal grooves
may be constructed.
Auditor Wells Will Sign the Demands
for Repairs to Schoolhouses With
out Concurrence of Superin
tendent Webster.
â¢
Mayor Phelan. Superintendent of Schools
Webster and Treasurer Brooks,, compris
ing the Public School Teachers' Annuity
and Retirement Fund Commission, met
yesterday morning and passed the de
mands, of thirty-one annuitants, aggre
gating $4029 65. Seven teachers were placed
on the pension list, as follows: Miss K.
F. McColgan. Mis- Nora G. Sullivan, Mrs.
Aure!ia Griffith*,, Miss A. A. Hill. Miss
Laura M. Barrows, Miss E. A. Cleveland
and Miss >". J. Canham.
{superintendent Webster, secretary of
the commission, tiled the following report,
which was adopted:
The income of the annuity fund at present is
$350 per month, of which one-quarter (foes to
the pumiiuent fund. The latter funil now
amounts to fll.OOu anil must be kept Intact un
til It reaches the sum of $00,i*h.. The amount
in pensions raid monthly is $1154 SS. It will be
necessary, beginning January l, 1901, to enforce
the pro rata clause of thÂ«> law. This provides
that whenever the revenue Is less than the
expenditures only that proportion of the pen
sion shall be j aid that the incomÂ« bears to ih<Â»
expenses. On January 1. 1S01, but 80 r**>" t p nt
of the annuities will be jiaid, and if no fur
ther additions are made to the annuities only
50 per c< nt r.fter that time.
The controversy that has existed be
tween the Board of Education and Super
intendent of Schools Webster over the re
sponsibility for repairs to schoolhouses Is
about to end. Auditor Wells received a
verbal opinion vesterday from his attor
neys, Lloyd & Wood, that a clear reading
of the charter did not necessitate the sig
nature of the Superintendent on the de
mands for labor or material required for
repairing schoolhouses. Mr. Wood and
City Attorney Lane held a conference yes
terday and it was agreed that the Board
of Public Works must do the repairing,
with the approval of the Board of Educa
tion and on the latter's recommendation.
The two attorneys concluded that the Su
perintendent does not enter into the prop
osition at all. and it is not necessary for|
him to audit the demands.
Upon that showing Auditor Wells has
requested that Wood and Lane put their
findings in written form and he will then
audit the demands for all repairs on
schoolhouFos. The demands of some twen
ty-one laborers in the repair department
will then be paid. Superintendent Web
ster is perfectly satisfied to be excused
from sipninp the demands, but says that
if his sipnature is required he would in
sist on the repairs being made in regular
form.

So many letters about bathing have
come to me from readers of this paper
in the past week or two that I have
decided to devote this talk to baths,
which are almost as great an institu-
tion in these times as they were fiwig
a.gx> in decadent Rome. But the Ro-
ir.ans bathed because It was fashion-
able; because they heard the gossip of
the day at the baths, because all there
v.-as perfume and elegance. And so they
carried bathing to an extreme that did
much to overthrow their empire.
To-day Americans bathe more than
any other nation, excepting, perhaps,
the Japanese. But we take our bath
because we wish to keep strong and
well; because we wish to be clean with
that cleanliness that throws off disease.
Therefore I would like everyone who
reads this to realize that it is just as
important not to bathe Improperly as it
Is to bathe at all. What is meat to one
may be poleon to another, and there-
fore It behooves every woman to study
her own constitution thoroughly before
she goes in for any one special kind of
bathing.
For the average person I would sus-
Â«st a cold plunge every morning. The
tub should be filled with cold water.
the body be brought to a glow with
exercise or rubbing, and a quick plunge
taken into the water. Sten out at once,
and rub the body thoroughly dry with
a coarse towel. If, however, after a.
bath of this kind the body should feel
at all chilled. It Is a sign that the prop-
er reaction does not take place, and it
should be discontinued at once.
Thin, nervous or anaemic women
Ehould not take the cold plung'?: it is
most effective for persons who are
stout or inclined that way. for it hard-
ens the muscles and prevents the too
rapid laying on of flesh.
A thin or ar.aemic person will find a
quick sponge bath, with moderately
warm water, the most satisfactory.
This b.ith should be taken every morn-
ing. For those who are troubled with
Insomnia I would suggest a hot bath
Just before retiring, and a quick rub
down with alcohol afterwards. Ner-
vous women, or those troubled with
any female disorder, will find a quick
6porg<? down the spine every morning
upon arising a most effective means of
strengthening.
Of course such bathine doesn't mean
external cleanliness. One might take
a cnld sponge or plunge every morning
cf the year, and yet not be clean unless
cleansing baths also were taken. Cold
baths are to strengthen the muscles
ar.<3 nerves, to create a reaction that
shall enable the pores of the skin to
throw off any impure matter.
Let the woman who would be clean
cleanse her face thoroughly at night
v.ith soap and warm water, and see
that her nails are well brushed. Then
enter a tub of warm water, scrub the
body thoroughly with soap, rinse off.
and dry. Rubbing the body afterwards
velth toilet water gives the flesh a de-
lightful softness and color. In the
morning upon rising every woman
ehould use the douche with moderately
warm water, lf she would keep herself
free from female troubles. (Often it is
advisable to use some antiseptic in the
water.) Very often, however, the aches
and pains of early womanhood have
been passed unheeded, and as a result
few women are without those troubles
thct are so great a menace to our sex.
Perfect health means no pain; perfect
cleanliness no inflammation. If we
have one or the other, even those
troubles that women are wont to con-
sider the inheritance of their sex. we
cannot be In perfect physical condition.
And to all who wish to be in such con-
dition let me whisper a word of advice:
Look carefully after your bathing, use
the douche as regularly as you take
your morning meal, and take Lydia E.
Pir.kham's Vegetable Compound. There
isn't a day in a woman's life on which
she couldn't take a warm bath; and If
she finds herself unable to do so, It is
because she is not well, and needs Mrs.
Pinkham's medicine.
I do wish I could impress upon all
the importance of this treatment. So
many write to me asking for advice
about health and cleanliness, but al-
ways about the outside of the body.
That the ekln ought to be in good con-
dition every woman understands; but
she doesn't seem to realize that it takes
more heroic measures than bathing to
cure blackheads and other eruptions of
trre skin. They are the result of the
Internal condition of our bodies, and
â¢would be cured If the organs of our sex
â¢were properly looked after. How can
Â«ny one expect to have a perfect skin,
even if she does clean It every day, If
she goes month after month suffering
pains that nature never Intended for
her? Let her get strength from Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound;
let her use the vaginal douche every
day. and her monthly pains will soon
disappear, and with them the eruptions
on the skin. Let every woman who
â¢would be perfectly clean bathe intelli-
gently, use the douche regularly and
keep her organs free from disease by
the UBe of Mrs. Pinkham's medicine.

PERSONAL MENTION.
It will be remembered that when a little more than
a year ago The Call obtained reports of the interna
tional j'acht race for the America's cup by wireless
telegraphy some of our slowgoing contemporaries
mocked at the feat as a "fake," and one went
It is to be noted, furthermore, that Marconi claims
that in future he will be able to dispense with the tall
mast used in transmitting and receiving messages and
substitute for it a cylinder comparatively short and
available for use in almost any locality. Thus it will
be seen the improvements follow one another rapidly,
and the system is approaching something like perfec
tion. >'Â»Â¦";.Â¦-"Â¦
The experiments were made with one station at
Poole, in Dorset^ and the other at St. Catherines, in
the Isle of Wight. An account of the result says:
"The other day two operators at St. Catherines were
instructed to send simultaneously two different wire
less messages to Poole, and without delay or mistake
the two were correctly recorded and printed down
ai the same time in Morse signals on the tapes of
the two corresponding receivers at Poole. In this
demonstration each receiver was connected to its o;vn
independent aerial wire hung from the same mast.
Mr. Marconi then^ placed the receivers at Poole ons
on top of the other and connected them both to one
and the same wire, about forty feet in length, attached
to a mast. , Two messages were sent at the same rao
men( by the operators at St. Catherines, one
ii> English and the other in French. With
cut failure each receiver at Poole rolled out its paper
tape, the message In English perfect on one, and that
in French on the other. Later on messages were re
ceived from a transmitter thirty miles away and re
corded by an instrument in .a closed room merely by
the aid of a zinc cylinder, four feet high, placed on a
chair. While these experiments have been proceed
ing between Poole and St Catherines others have
been taking place for the British Admiralty between
Portsmouth and Portland, these lines of communica
tion intersecting each other, yet so perfect is the in
dependence that nothing done on one circuit now
affects the other, unless desired."
The most notable of the recent improvements in. the
system is that of providing for secrecy in the dis
patches. When first introduced the messages trans
mitted through the air could be read, by any receiving
instrument within the range of the transmitter. That
objection led to the conviction that the system would
never be of practical value in the general work of
telegraphy. It now appears, however, that Marconi
has overcome the defect. He has made several tests
in England in transmitting messages for a distance of
thirty miles by a system which preserves the accuracy
and secrecy of the dispatches absolutely.
p\z\ ARCONI'S system of wireless telegraphy con
/ \ tinues to advance from improvement to im
provement with such rapidity that there arc
now widespread expectations it may yet supersede
telegraphy by wire almost altogether. It is but a
short time ago it was deemed wonderful that such
telegraphy should be practicable at all. Indeed when
The Call obtained reports by wireless telegraphy
of the arrival of the Sherman with the California Vo!
uuteers from Manila cur contemporaries were incred
ulous; but now the system has been so far perfected
that according to a report from London the Postal
Commission of Great Britain has decided to recom
mend the adoption of the system as a part of the
postal telegraphy of the kingdom.
WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.
Qne of the: chief causes of the new impulse toward
road improvement in Massachusetts and the East
generally is the increasing usefulness of the automo
bile.. It is not satisfactory to Americans to note that
in the development of a mechanism of that kind the
people of this country have to lag behind Europe. In
France the automobile is no longer a novelty con
fined to cities. The machines can be Ken everywhere
in the country. The French are thug reaping a
rich harvest for the work they have done in road
making. Our Eastern "States have intelligence enough
to learn the lesson and profit by it, and California
should net be laggard in following the example.
Cajifornia is not so thickly settled as Massachu
setts, nor sd rich, and consequently cannot keep pace
with her in road improvement; but California can at
leaM follow in the way Massachusetts is leading.. We
can improve our highways in all counties where thers
is much travel. The construction of good roads is
one of the best investments that can be made by any
community. The waste and loss that bad roads en
tail will far more than balance the cost of good ones.
California can find a model to pattern after in this
respect in Massachusetts. President Menden
lial of the Worcester Polytechnic Institute, who
is a member of the Massachusetts Highway
Commission, in a recent address on what is
being done in the State is reported to have
suid "that during the last six or eight years
more money had been spent there in road improve
ment than in any other State. The plan now in pro
cess of execution involves a reconstruction of the
road system of the commonwealth, embracing about
two thousand miles, or io per cent of the whole,, to
which local effort will doubtless in time make large
additions. An annual appropriation of $500,000 en
ables the commission to complete about fifty miles
every year, and it could Â»probably obtain $1,000,000
from the Legislature if it so desired."
THE GOOD ROADS MOVEMENT.
WITH the elections out of the way, the crops all
harvested and marketed, the people of Califor
nia have now opportunity of leisure to take up
again the good roads movement of which so much
was expected when began the campaign of education
on the subject a few year? ago. The movement was
unfortunate then because it occurred in a season of
hard times. The people were not in a mood to un
dertake much in the way of improvements that would
be costly. We are now prosperous, and the promise
is for a greater prosperity to come. Consequently if
road improvement plans be wisely devised and
rightly supported now we may accomplish great
things in that. direction in the near future.
Out of that liberalism there would grow a fairer
sense of the rights of the colored race. A large part
of the wrongs now inflicted upon the negroes in the
South ere due more to the lack of liberalizing in
foicnccs than to any natural depravity on the part of
the v.hhes. Given two parties, each led by men into
whose hands the government of cities and of States
iriigiit be fairly intrusted, and the Southern people
would soon be so much like those of the North and
the West that unnatural politics would disappear
from the cour.try and there would be no long-er a
"solid South" with its pack of votes to be cast for
Democracy, no matter upon what issue the campaign
turned. For sll these reasons it is to be hoped the
rdmirnstration v.ill give its a:4 to any well devised
plan to build v? *he Republican party in the South.
The descendants of the men who supported Clay
cnght to be willing to stand firmly by the party that
now represents the great policies of Clay.
Over and above all the material benefits which may
be expected to accrue from the formation of a strong
Republican party in the South will be the moral
good that will result from it. Liberalism and tolera
tion are more often the results of education than of
nature. Where almost all white men are of one party
there naturally grows up z. spirit of intolerance and
bigotry and prejudice. A campaign in which great
national issues would be fairly argued on both sides,
â¢p.here each man would find among his neighbors
many good citizens snd good friends opposed to his
politics] views, would tend to liberalize Southern sen
timent and bring it intc harmony with that of the rest
The evil was even more notable this year. Four
years of prosperity had brought many progressive
Southern men into complete harmony with the admin
istration. There was to be found in every Southern
State a host of men who cal'.ed themselves "McKinley
Democrats." So strong was the sentiment among the
manufacturers and business men of the' South in favor
cf the re-election of McKir.lcy that Senator Caffery
of Louisiana said the Southern delegates to the Kan
sas City convention would insist on the renomination
of Bryan because they deemed that to be the surest
way of bringing about a continuance of the present
administration.
The unnatural political condition of the South has
affected injuriously the whole country. When Cleve
land went into cfHce to, carry out his programme o:
re-venue tariff he found in Congress a large number
of Southern Democrats who were as strongly in favor
cf protection as any Republican of the North. By
reason of that fact the Wilson bill was made an
abortive measure Â£nd so distorted that Cleve
land refused to sign it. Had the Southern people
voted as they thought on that issue Cleveland would
never have been elected.. As it was he attained off.c*
by the votes cf people many of- whom were opposed
tc almost every important measure of his administra
tion.
icr Â£tta^nm2f it.
There is abundant encouragement for such a move-'
merit, ar.d its success would be ot immense benefit to
the Southern people and indirectly to the whole
Union. The South has been for years suffering the
e%"ils of unnatural politics. All Southern men do nor
think alike on economic topics any more than all
Northern men, and in the natural order of things
there should be two parties among the whites of thai
section as well as elsewhere. In the old days'before
the war the policy cf protection to American manu
factures was advocated as strongly and as eloquently
by Henry Clay of the South as by Daniel Webster of
the- North, and there was then a strong Whig parry
in every Southern State. A revival of that condition
cf things is desirable from even* point cf viy.v, and
the present situation affords exceptional opportunities

Apropos of this subject of scen!s deco

instructive article in the Art Amateur for
October, wherein he shows how stupidity
crops out in places where you would least
expect to flnd.lt. Thus, the third act cf
Otis Skinner's gorgeous production of
"Prince Otto" is supposed to takÂ» placs
in a council chamber that has no Trlniow

painted so as to represent the light as
coming from the front and soms from
the side! Again, In 'the farmer's Lut of

to the rightâ a half-door because the hero
requires something over which he â¢Â»n
gracefully loll while talking to the ladles.
The action of the play takes two days.
and behold! in these two days the narrow
half-door has grown to a large arch,
through which we witness a revolt of tha
peasantry. "Farmer Leopold may culti

WILLIAM ARCHER, THE PRE
MIER DRAMATIC CRITIC OF
GREAT BRITAIN.
All that is excellent, but we can hardly admit that
the mountaineers are the most polite men in America.
The explanation of the liking Mr. Vansittart has for
them may be due to the fact that when he perceived
that everj- or.e of them had a rifle he treated them po
litely and restrained that tongue which was so caustic
at New Orleans. Being thus kindly disposed him
self, he was received with kindness. He would have
met the same good manners elsewhere had he been
equally mild in his manner of greeting the people he
came into contact with. All the same we are pleased
to note the change in his views, and for the cordial
praise he has spoken of the heroes of Chickamauga
he merits our full forgiveness for all he said of old
about our morals and manners.
With the people of the mountains "Mr. Vansittart
was delighted. He is quoted as saying of them: "The
mountaineers impressed me as being the most polite
people I have met in America. They usually ad
dressed me as "brother.' It seems to be the custom
there to call one another 'brother.' They are primi
tive folk and live in a simple way, but I liked them
very much. The'men still carry the long-barrele'd,
heavy, small-bore rifles such as their great-grand
fathers used."
Since his strictures upon us were so widely circu
lated to his discredit, it is only fair to call attention
to the improvement in his opinions. Discussing his
impressions of the battle of Chickamauga, which he
gained by a visit to the famous field, he says: ***I
could not but marvel at the wonderful courage and
fighting qualities which the American soldiers must
have "had to take some of the seemingly impregnable
positions on that battle-field. I don't believe the world
will ever see fighting like that again. Modern, meth
ods of warfare give no chance for such fighting, and
somehow I cannot believe that there are any soldiers
of to-dr.y who have the same quality of courage as
that of the soldiers of the Civil War on both -sides.
To me the battle-field of Chickamauga is more inter
esting than the battle-field of Waterloo, and one can
not wander over it as I did and not come away with
a tremendous respect for the Americans who fought
there and the military genius which directed the
battle."'
IâPERSONS who give attention to the condescen
l / sions of foreigners who criticize American
morals and manners will recall- that not long
ago A. S. "Vansittart, British Consul -at New Orleans,
permitted himself to indulge in some strictures upon
us that were met with no little indignation. The critic
was subjected to a vigorous "roasting" for hi3 im
pudence, and there were many suggestions that it
Â¦would be a good thing for him to go home. He did
not take that- advice, ho.vever, but went to spend the
summer in the recesses of the mountains of North
Carolina and Tennessee. In that marvelous "land
of the sky" he found a better humor than he^had at
New Orleans, and has come forth to say a great many
complimentary things.

Mr. George Moore, as we learned two
weeks ago, thinks that dramatic and all
other kinds of art are dead in England,
France and Germany: Norway and Ire
land, according to him. embody our only
hope for the future. That is very hard
on the three nations which, since the de
cline of art in Italy, have been supposed
to lead the world. One Is consoled, how
ever, on learning from a much better au
thority than Mr. Moore, that "the spirit
of the age, far from being hostile to
drama and great drama, seems to be
peculiarly favorable to it." So writes MrJ
Archer in an article on "Maeterlinck
and Mystery" (Critic for September.*. He
then proceeds to enumerate sixteen mod
ern plays which he believes go to prove
his. contention. This list is valuable, giv
ing, as it does, the deliberate Judgment of
an acknowledged specialist an to the best
that has been accomplished In th!s genera
tion. Anybody who wants to keep up with
the development of the drama must fa
miliarize himself with this "best"; I
therefore Â¦ reprint the list, adding the
names of author, translator and pub
lisher whenever I have been able to find
them. To buy all the books in this list
would involve a considerable expenditure
r.t first, but would prove economical in
the long run; for when you know these
sixteen plays thoroughly you will spend
little money going to the- theater to see
the trash ordinarily presented.
Wholesome Judgments these. If some
what sharp and profitable for guidance,
If they will but heed, to those of our play-
OTfghtS who are blinded to self-respect
by the dazzling light reflected from the
surface of a dollar.
In Mr. Archer's recently published
"Study and S'tagre" (Grant Richards) there
are some interesting remarks on Ameri
can plays that have found their way to
London. To epitomize. "The Heart of
Maryland'*' he finds commonplace beside
that masterpiece of its class. "Secret Ser
vice." In the latter play the leading sit
uations are almost psychological: in the
former they are merely pictorial or arise
from sudden revelations or depend upon
sheer violence and brutality. The one ab
solutely despicable scene is that wherein
an immense sensation is aimed at by
having the heroine hans on the clapper of
a bell. "The "effect is merely ludicrously
forcibleâ feeble.
The much condemned scene in "The
Conquerors" Mr. Archer finds no worse
than a like scene In "The Sign of the
Cross" (he might have included "Quo
Vadis"). "when Bishops blessed it and
Archdeacons kissed the hem of- Mr. Wil
son Barrett's exiguous tunic." -The plaz
as a whole "is tedious, unpleasant, deplor
able, but if it were the censor's. business
to veto every similar, play half the the
aters in I.ondon would have to close.
"The Belle of New York" is declared to
be one long carnival of the joy of living
In its coarsest acceptationâ garish, un
lovely, reeking of .alcohol and redolent of
patchouli. The writing, though. Is not
despicable and the music is Ingeniously
adaptive. The leading (American) ladies
are not only beautiful hilt accomplished
artists in their way and the comedians
(likewise Americans) are really clever.

International arbitration is to establish between na
tions the same means of adjustment that are furnished
between individuals in the ordinary courts of law.
From these none are excluded. Indeed they are
specially for the use of the weak/whose rights exceed
their defensive strength. So it must be with nations.
All must have access to the bar of justice, and then
will dawn the time when nation shall not lift up the
sword against nation, neither shall they learn war
I any more.
One further step is needed. The small and weak na
tion? must, in equity, be admitted to seats in that
court. The strong powers cannot afford to exclude
them and thereby raise the implication that they are
reserved to be the prey of aggression.
In the red glare that dazzled men when the con
ference sat but little attention was paid to its sole re
sult. The arbitration convention was treated with in
cifTercnce. and the nations party to the conference
were slow in its ratification. It is pleasant to know,
however, that the United States led. both in ratifying
and appointing members of the great court of arbitra
tion. President McKinley showed the rarest judg
ment in offering the places to two ex-Presidents, Mr.
Cleveland and General Harrison, both of them fore
most men of their time and peers of the primates of
any time. Mr. Cleveland found himself unable to con
quer his aversion to te-entering public life and de
clined, but General Harrison accepted, and it is sai-i
that his colleague will be Judge Gray of Delaware.
The tone of Lord Siiisbury's speech indicates that
England will soon follow our example and commis
sion members of the court, and soon the great
tribunal will be fully constituted and the nations will
have a new guarantee against war.
In consequence we may expect the meager results
of the peace conference at The Hague to be magni
fied The court for arbitration of international dis
putes will probably become the most important body
since the Apostles were chosen and commissioned.
But the thinking men of the world, whose though:
runs in line with that of the British Prime Minister,
will prevail against the mere thirst for slaughter
which makes war an offensive art.
War is an art defensive and offensive. Hereafter,
for a long period, it is apt to be studied only in its
defensive utility. In that aspect no nation can afford
tc ignore it. Coasts will be made impregnable to an
enemy, and the accumulated wealth won in peace will
be made enjoyable in safety, by defenses that no power
can reduce.
Civilization has before it higher and better duties
than the invention of means to more horribly mangle
men. Humanity has 2 higher mission than to kill and
be kijled. The century has closed as it opened, with
a red carnival. In all human affairs reaction follows
action, ar.d the banners of peace, furled and apparently
forgotten, will unfold again and men will' cheer them
louder than the shouts that have made battle stan
dards shiver in the air.
D T the Lord Mayor's banquet in Guildhall Lord
f\ Salisbury took occaÂ«iQn to express serious
* * views on the growth of the war spirit in Eng
land. Assuming that the Transvaal war could not b=
escaped, and that the Chinese situation was forced by
the Boxer revolution, he deprccr.ted, even to satire,
the war spirit, 2nd cast a funereal gloom over the
feast by picturing the awful sacrifices that war entails.
The Prime Minister's evident desire to check the
growing tendency to eclipse the victories of peace be
hind the triumphs of war will strike a sympathetic
chord in this country as well as in England. War is
a frightful incident. Let nations beware of its becom
ing a frightful habit.

Historic Properties to Be Sold.
Among the properties of the estate of
th<? late Calvin F. Fargo which Davidson
& Leigh have for sale are some old land
marks of historic interest. The original
Poodle Dog restaurant, corner Grant ave
nue and Bush street, was for years the
center toward which genial friendliness
and good fellowship instinctively con
verged, and Its memory holds a warm
epot in the heart of the pioneer. It was
the scene of many a hearty gathering;
the trysting place of many a convivial
ecuI. Its popularity is by no means lim
ited to former years, however, as under
tew auspices the old corner has taken on
new life, and the younger bloods of the
present generation who prefer Its quiet
end retirement are drawn to it in prefer
ence to similar resorts in more bustling
portions of the city.
And who is th^re among the lovers of
the ribbons and the road who ha? not an

The Judge said he would be at leisure to

SAN DIEGO MAY
BE DROPPED AS
PORT OF CALL
The managers of the Kosmos line are
seriously contemplating the dropping of
San Diego from Its ports of call, and
bringing all merchandise for shipment
East to San Francisco. The Santa Fe
through line is now in first-class working
order and can handle all that the vessels
bring from Europe and South America, A
stop at San Diego means a heavy outlay,
that can be avoided by bringing freight
and passengers to this port. The chances
are that the failure to bring freight for
Ban Dlegro Is the flrBt move toward drop
ping that place as a port of call.
SAN DIEGO, Nov. 10.â The Kosmos
liner Isis arrived here this morning, 117
days from Hamburg. She reports an un
usually pleasant passage, without incident
of any kind. She brings only 1500 tons of
freight, principally ore from Antofogasta,
and has sixteen passengers for San Diego
and ten for San Francisco.' The officers
report that on account of orders from San
Francisco they refused about S00 tons of
freight consigned to the East through this
port. Agent Stuart of the Santa Fe con
firmed the report about the refusal of
freight for .this port, but knew nothing of
the reason why such orders had been- sent.
"I know the Santa Fe would only be too
glad to handle all the freight that the
Kosmos steamers can bring to this port,"
Bald Mr. Stuart, "and as the orders to re
fuse the cargo came from the steamship
officials the trouble is evidently with
them."
It Is believed that some serious conflict
has arisen between the steamship and the
railroad companies, as the IbIs -refused
freight either for San Diego or San Fran
cisco that was for shipment East. -

division was notified yesterday of the des
titute condition of a family named Peter
son, residing at S Shipley street. A little

with typhoid fever and its parents had no
money to pay a doctor. Dr. H. C. Ed

A TWO-HORSE TEAM FALLS INTO A NEW CELLAR THAT IS BEING
EXCAVATED ON BRANNAN STREET THROUGH GIVING WAY OF A
PLATFORM. AND THREE MEN ARE INJURED.
pital Drs. Dray, Robinson and Irones went
to work upon them. An examination
showed that Schlotterbach had both his
legs broken, his scalp is very badly lace
rated and there Is a probable fracture of
the skull; nis body is covered with
bruises, and Dr. Dray thinks that he Is
injured internally. Kelly had his left arm
broken in two places and he also is cov
ered with bruises. Young has some very
bad bruises on the back, but is not dan
gerously wounded. He was sent home
and Kelly was later sent to St. Mary's
Hospital, but Schlotterbach was too badly
hurt to be moved.
One of the hordes had its back broken
in the fall and had to be killed. The other
animal, strange to say, escaped with a
few scratches.
"We had been driving on that same
platform for weeks," said John Kelly yes
terday, "and now It came to give way
when it did- is a mystery. I drove up with
my load and was Just about to dump It
when there came a crash and down we
went. The next thing I remember was
when the ambulance men were getting
me out of the cellar. It was a hard Job
but poor Schlotterbach was the one who
suffered moat. I suppose the constant Jar
undermined the platform and caused it to
givo way. Anyhow, I won't be able to
do any work on the new one when it is
No one connected with the "U'lne Com
pany can give any explanation of how the
platform gave way, nor can the con
tractor.
THERE was a most remarkable
accident at "455 Brannan street
about noon yesterday. The Cal
ifornia Wtne Association is con
structing some new wine cellars
there and a team of horses with wagon
attached was backed on the receiving
platform. The platform gave way and
the driver, animals and loaded wagon
were precipitated into the space below.
Unfortunately two men were at work In
the cellar and one of them was perhaps
fatally hurt; the other got on! with a few
scratches; the driver was badly injured;
one of the horses was killed, and the other
escaped, while the wagon was wrecked.
In order to facilitate work the contrac
tor had built a receiving platform and
chute into the cellar. On the platform the
rock and cement for the concrete was
dumped. Then when released the stuff in
falling became mixed and thus saved a
lot of work. About 11:30 a. m. yesterday
John Kelly, who resides at 705 Natoma
street, came along with a load of rock.
He drove up the platform and was Just
preparing to dump his load when the plat
form gave way.
Right under the platform F. Schlotter
bach, whose home Is at 724 Mission street,
and Robert Young, who resides at 315
Minna street, were at work. Schlotter

BARGAINS EN LACE CURTAINS.
Sale Commences Tuesday flofmiing.
A St. Gall manufacturer has sent us part of his surplus stock of Irish
Point Lace Curtains, to close out at less than wholesale prices. Some fine,
rare bargains.
beautiful diamond necklace. She accepts
the loan joyfully and duly attends the
ball. But by an evil chance the nccklaco
is stolen from her. Not daring to go to
her friend and confess the loss, for fear
of unjust suspicions, she and her husband
mortgage their future to obtain a dia-
mond necklace, as like to the one lost as
possible. The Jewels are returned. The
exchange is unnoticed by the school
fi-end, who soon after sets out to rnak.3
her residence in another part of the coun-
tr Then begins the life-long struggle to
pav for the substituted Jewels. All
pleasures have to be denied. The most
rigid economy of dress and living are
practiced, ana slowly in long years this
debt cf many thousand francs is cleared
off. But this long struggle deeply marks
the character of the unfortunate wife.
She neglects herself and loses her fresh-
ness and fairness. Her husband be-
comes a sloven. Both are bitter of
speech. The meanness of their living
grows upon them and makes them
mean, and when the debt Is finally paid It
finds the still young woman old in looks
and in her way of life. , ; ''V.
About this time the old-time school
friend returns to Paris and calls are ex-
changed. The healthy, radiant young
matron, just home again, can hardly
recognize in her friend the sparkling
young woman to whom she lent tho
necklace.
"What have you been doing with
yourself?" she cries. "You look faded,
old. worn-out, as if life had held th*
cup of misery unceasingly to your lips."
And then the old-young woman tells
the utory of the loss of the necklace, the
substituted Jewels and the long years of
sacrifice and suffering endured in order
to pay the debt.
"what!" cries her friend, "you have
done all that! Why did you not come to
me and tell me? I could have saved you
all these years of useless suffering. I did
not lend you tho real gems, but a paste
Imitation."
A WOMAN'S WASTED LIFE.
Fancy the feelings of the unhappy
woman who learns that she has suffered
needlessly. That all the pleasures and
pursuits she has been shut out from
might have been hers; that her face
m!ght yet have been fair and her form
young if she had only not kept silence
at that time of crisis.
That was how one woman's life was
wasted in needless sacrifice and suffering.
There are thousands and tens of thou-
sands of other women who lead a life of
suffering more ?itlablo and even more
unnecessary. There are women to whom
each recurring month brings a time of
torment; women whose vitality Is oozing
away because of unchecked drains upon
the womanly strength; women who have
borne children at such a penalty of pain
that life has scarcely a pleasure left for
them; women, again, who know tho
burning torment of Inflammation and the
gnawing agony of ulccratlon, until the-
misery seems past bearing.
And all this suffering is needless In
ninety-eight cases out of every hun-
dred. And In the two exceptional cases
the conditions can be greatly helped
and the suffering alleviated.
WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN CURED.
"I was a great sufferer for six years
and doctored all the time with a number
of different physicians, but did not re-
ceive any benefit," writes Mrs. George
Sogden, 641 Bonda street, Saglnaw
(South), Mich. "One day as I was read-
Ing a paper I saw your advertisement,
and. although I had given up all hope or
ever getting better, thought I would writo
to you. when I received your letter, tell-
ing me what to do, I commenced to take
your 'Favorite Prescription" and follow
your advice.. I have taken ten bottles
in all, also five vials of the 'Pleasant
Pellets." Am now regular after having
missed two years and suffered with
pain In the head and back. I was so
nervous, could not eat or sleep. Now I
can thank you for my recovery."
There is a case where a timely use of
Dr. Plerce's Favorite Prescription would
have saved six long years- of suffering-
six years of headache, backache and
sleeplessness. No woman can be healthy
unless the periods are regular, and there
is no medicine can compare with.
"Favorite Prescription" for the perfect
regulation of tho periods, and it regulates
to stay, once and for all. It is a remark-
able fact that a large part of the cures
effected by the use of "Favorite Pre-
scription" are cures of diseased conditions
of the womanly organs, which local phy-
sicians have failed to benefit by their
treatment, and which other medicines
have been powerless to remove.
"I was troubled with female weakness
for eight years and suffered more- than I
can tell," writes Mrs. Gust Moser of
Ovando. Deer Lodge County. Mont. -"My
disposition was affected to auch an extent
that to say r pleasant word to any one
was almost an impossibility.
"I had two operations performed by
one of the most skilled Burgeons of the
"West, but did not get relief. Then.
against my doctor's strict orders. I com-
menced taking Dr. Pierce's Favorite
Prescription and 'Golden Medical Dis-
covery, and also followed the advice
given in the Common Sense Medical Ad-
viser.
"I continued this treatment for three
months and to-day am as healthy and
well bs a woman can be. I cannot
thank Dr. Pierce enough for his kind let-
ters to me."
Dr. Plerce's Favorite Prescription
strengthens all the womanly organs, re-
moves the strain which causes nervous-
ness and 80 quiets the nerves and In-
duces natural, healthful sleep. It makes
childbirth practically painless and gives
to nursing mothers the vitality needed
to nurse and nourish their children.
THE TIME TO SPEAK OUT.
Every sick and ailing woman Is Invited
to consult Dr. Pierce, by letter, free. This'
puts within every ailing woman's reach,
without fee or charge, the medical opinion

Sometimes dealers are tempted by the
little more profit in some Inferior medi-
cine to try and substitute It for "Favorite
Prescription." This is an attack on your
Judgment, your purse and your physical
wpII being. Rebuke It. Insist on havlnir
"Favorite Prescription" and prove It to
be all it claims â "A Godsend to weak and
worn-out women." It makes weak women

across the sea of suffering and gives a

young wife longs to attend, but feels
that she could not venture upon so
splendid a function without jewels, which
she does not possess and cannot afford to

1228 MARKET STREETSAN RAFAEL, Nov. 10.â John Furlong,
market hunter on the bay shore, near
Black Point, nearly lost hl3 life in a sink
box, from which he was shooting ducks
last night. His box broke Its anchorage
and floatfed out in the fog of San Pablo
Bay. He was not rescued until nearly
dead from cold at midnight.
Some t'ays ago Furlong conceived the
Idea that a large cask, -weighted down and
anchored off shore, would serve as a good
hiding place whence to shoot ducks and
he rigged one up. -Late yesterday after
noon he was rowed out to and deposited
ln - his barrel. So busy was he shooting
at the evening flight of ducks that he
failed to notice the anchor line break, and
soon he was helplessly floating on the tide.
A light wind blowing off shore sent him
out on San Pablo Bay. A dense fog set
tled down with the darkness and Furlong
was lost.
When his partner returned to take him
from the barrel. he guessed at the man s
fate and rowed out Into the bay, firing his
gun and shouting. At last Furlong was
located and rescued, together with His
small spaniel, which had been his com
panion and shared his peril in the floating
barrel.

organization known as the White Men's
Vnion for alleged misconduct of affairs.
At the recent election Scott was defeated
end later was warned to leave the coun
try, which he refused to do. Late Wed
nesday afternoon the Sheriff was shot
and seriously wounded by an unknown
person. Emmett Scott, a brother of the
Sheriff, ar.d William McDonald engaged
in a Ptreet duel. When the smoke of bat

The entire town of Anderson was In a

Sheriff Scott took possession of the jail,
which he has since held by force. To
day Adjutant General Scurry arrived at
the scene of the trouble and at once set
about to restore order. The Houston
Light Guards were ordered to Anderson.
Sheriff Scott has consented to leave 1 the

Congress with a request for an appropria
tion of $15,000,000 as a starter and Denver
will try to send a bis delegation to Chi
cago to boom this idea. The business men
of the Eaet are already awake. It is
claimed, and will join hands with the
business men of the West in seeing that
a big appropriation Is made to start the
work.
The idea Is to have the Government con
serve the Â¦waters near the heads of
streams and leave the distribution to
private capital. The engineers claim that
an expenditure of $150.0W,000 will not only
provide water for reclaiming all the irri
gable land In the "West, furnish homes for
at least 50,000,000 of people, but will will
put an end to the disastrous Bprlng floods
that devastate the Mississippi and Mis
souri valleys every year and will render
unnecessary the expenditure, of large
lums annually by the Government build-
Ing levees. The movement Is to be a
movement of business men in the Interest
of building up the West and making
homes for a larger population. George II.
Max-well, chairman or the National Irri
gation Association, will be here Monday
to address the meeting.

Is any possibility of such a future for the
islands, especially so .as at present, and
for many years to come, the necessity of a
large American military and naval force
is too apparent to admit of discussion. On
the other hand, however, there are many
encouraging conditions to sustain such a
conviction. For example, in the Philip
pines there Is no dynasty to destroy: ro
organized system of feudal laws to eradi
cate: no principles Inconsistent with re
publicanism which had solidly Inslnuatei
themselves into the national life to dis
place; no adverse aspects of nature to
overcome. On the contrary, nature, which
Is "exuberant, balmy and generous, has
nourished into existence several millions
of sensitive and credulous people, without
allegiance to any existing- Institutions, but
animated by certain inchoate Ideas and
aspirations, which by some unfortunate
perversion of thought they conceive to be
threatened by America. These people, for
tunately, are intelligent, generous and
flexible, and probably will yield quickly
and with absolute confidence to tuition
and advice when thoroughly Informed of
American Institutions and purposes. As a
future thought in the same direction it
may be suggested that the Aryan races
are making their way back Into the old
continent, which as a consequence is like
ly within a generation more to become the
theater of gigantic political activities. Up
to this time the practical effect of repub
lican Institutions has not been considered

of necessity must exert an active and po
tential influence upon the affairs of Asia,
which under the inspiration of American
Ideas transmitted through Filipinos may
exhibit the greatest of political wonders.
A rather broad conception, perhaps, but
one well calculated to fix the attention of
the most casual observer and to warm
the fancy of the most indifferent."
WASHINGTON, Nov. lO.-Major Gen
eral Arthur MacArthur, commanding the
army in the Philippines and military Gov
ernor of the islands slnce'"May 5, 1900,
has submitted his report to the War De
partment. A considerable portion of the
report relates to events which took place
previous to the date when he assumed
command, and he publishes some of the
correspondence and proclamations of the
Filipinos obtained before that time. He
refers to the change in Aguinaldo's plans
in abandoning his army organization and
starting a guerrilla warfare. The condi
tions of the country have afforded advan
tages for such a policy, he says, as t.iey
have enabled the Insurgents to appear
and disappear at their convenience. At
one time they are soldiers and immeui
ately after are within the lines In the at
titude of peaceable natives. - A widely
scattered formation of Filipinos quickly
followed the guerilla warfare, which led
to a corresponding dissemination of
American troops, there being fifty-three
military stations In the archipelago Iso
vembtr 1. 1S99, and 413 stations September
1, 1900. This resulted in a large number
of minor affairs, many of which did not
assume the dignity of a regular combat,
though the casualties between the dates
stated were 268 Americans killed, 750
wounded and 63 captured, the Filipino
losses during the same time being 3227
killed.' 694 wounded and 2SB4 cantured.
General MacArthur sayB the extensive
distribution of troops has strained the
soldiers of the army to the full limit of
endurance. He says the apparently de
sultory work has demanded more of dis
cipline and as much of valor as was re
quired during the period of regular ope
rations against concentrated field forces
of insurrectionists. General MacArthur
speaks In the highest terms of the ser
vice rendered by the troops amid all la
bors and hardships.
"The Filipinos, says General MacAr
thur, "are not a warlike or ferocious peo
ple. Left to themselves, a large number
of them would gladly accept American
MacArthur Sends Long Re

ditions.
PRESENT NEEDS
IN PHILIPPINES
He says that this statement applies to
the entire archipelago, excepting the por
tion of Mindanao occupied by Moros. and
the Join group. The Moros seem entirely
satisfied with present conditions.
General MacArthur quotes captured cor
respondence to show the efforts of the in
surgent leaders to Intimidate and control
the people. He declares that the guerrilla
supremacy, which they are gradually
comlnp to understand means Individual
liberty and absolute security In their
lives and propertv. They have been mad
dened, however, the past five years, by
rhetorical sophistry and stimulants ap
plied to national pride, until the power
of discriminating In matters of public
cohcern or private Interest has been al
most entirely suspended. As a substitute
for all other considerations the people
seem to be actuated by the Idea that In
all doubtful matters of politics or war
men are never nearer ripnt that when
going with their own kith and kin, re
gardless of correctness." This condition,
he says, has raised difficulties and ob
structions In pacification.
The effort to Institute municipal govern
ment under Amerlcan-Â»ausplces carried the
Idea of exclusive fidelity to the United
States, but this met with difficulties where
Pillplnos were placed entirely In control,
and secret municipal governments were
organized In various towns under Insur
gent auspices to proceed simultaneously
with the American Government and often
through the same personnel. Presidents
and town officials acted in behalf of Amer
icans and secretly In behalf of the Insur
gents, and paradoxical as It may seen,
with considerable apparent solicitude for
the interests of both. Wherever there Is
a group of Insurgent forces, contiguous
towns contribute to their support and ren
der great assistance in secreting the sol
diers and helping them to -escape. The
reports says the success of the guerrilla
system depends upon complete unity of
action among the native population. That
there Is such unity Is frankly acknowl
edged, but how it is brought about.
General MacArthur says he Is unable to
ascertain. Intimidation accounts for the
condition to some extent. He adds: "It
is more prM>able that the adhesive prin
ciple comes from ethnological homogeneity,
which induces men to respond for a time
to the appeals of consanguineous leader
ship, even when such action is opposed to
their own Interest and convictions of ex
pediency."

man, and beÂ£?ed for a <5rir.k of be^r.
Dore was busy at the time ar.d was ex-

Accordinc to the story tola by Dore to
me Morgue plflcl^ls and to Detective

asked for the drink. Dore told him to pet
out and pointed the bulb, -which he car
ried in his hand, toward the door. The
men were near each other, and when Dore
reached out the lamp the stranger
praÂ«Â«pod the end of it. Almost instantly
he f*H to the floor. Kverything' was done

When the ambulance reached the Re

Detective Ryan was detailed on the ca^-e

that while handling the buib he aiso re

must have been suffering from a weak
heart when he grasped the lamp.
The victim of the tragedy was about

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 11, , 1000.
Democratic State Senator-Elect In
.Seventeenth District Neglected to
Comply "With Law's Formality.
It was- ascertained in the Registration
Office yeBtenJay that Joseph Plunkett. the
successful Democratic candidate for State
Senator in the Seventeenth Senatorial Dis
trict, nedected to register for the last
JOSEPH PLUNKETT DID
NOT REGISTER HIS NAME
election.
Registrar Walsh states that Plunkett's
failure to comply with the formality will
not Invalidate his election. The law sim
ply- provides that to be chosen as Senator
a man must have been a citizen and In
habitant of the State for. three years and
of the district one year previous to being
elected.
The records show that I'lunkett was
registered for last year's election, where
his name appears In the ninth precinct of
the Twenty-ninth Assembly District. His
residence is given as 318 Clementina street.
>*â >i HARLES E. MACRUM of East
g ' Liverpool, Ohio, ex-Consul at
fi - Pretoria, who created a stir In
V J Government circles last spring
by accusing the British officials
in South Africa with tampering with his
mail, is at the Palace Hotel.
This Is Macrum's first visit to the coast
and there were no acquaintances here to
recognize or greet him when he sauntered
into the hotel office, with his arms full of
luggage, to affix his signature to the reg
ister. And even If there had been any
old friends in waiting it is doubtful if his
identity would have been disclosed, for
he has grown a mustache that changes
his appearance materially. .
Macrum is out here as traveling sales
man for a Pittsburg. Pa., glass firm. He
saya he is out of politics, but declares he
is still loyal to the Republican party.
His faith In the administration appears to
have 1 lost its keen ardor, however, and an
effort to engage him in a discussion of
McKinley's victory was rewarded by an
abrupt Inquiry as to Rome of San Fran
cisco's notable attractions.
Macrum says he is still unable to ex
plain to his own satisfaction why he was
removed as Consul to Pretoria.
"After I had preferred the charges
agoinst the British officials for tampering
with my mall (and, by the way, those
charges were well founded, too) I asked
for- a leave of absence, which was grant
ed me,"" he said yesterday. "Upon my
airlval home I was surprised to learn
that Adelbert F. Hay, son of Secretary
Hay, had been named to take my place
I had known President McKiniey for
twelve years nnd was greatly surprised at
his action. Even now I am unable to un
derstand why I was so unceremoniously
dropped."
Macrum expects to be in San Francisco
a week or ten days.

ner, will not be the least of the many at
tractions of this miniature Coney Island.
This Chutes has an electric searchlight,
which Is constantly moving around like
our own familiar light on Halght street.
The car ascending moves slowly and halt
ingly, while the boats toboggan down the
slide with the mad rush familiar to us all.
A macadamized sidewalk with electric
street lamps leads from the dancing pa
vilion to the Mystic Maze, which is filled
with, delighted visitors in the persons of
gavly dressed dolls. Then comes the
ticket office and stairway leading to the
immense Ferris wheel, a perfect reproduc
tion of the monster wheel at the Chicago
"World's Fair. It has 24 perfectly adjusted
cars, which move slowly around and are
filled with dolls, who are no doubt enjoy
ing the sights that they behold at their
great elevation.
Passing a charming seaside home, with
its broad lawns, stable, etc., the doll vis
itors to Coney Island reach the merry-go
round, a structure about 10 feet In diame
ter, with moving horses, swings, boats,
etc., peopled with dolls. Next comes the
Seaside Theater, which has a large, cool,
comfortable pavilion in which the audi
ence is grouped about little tables, watch
ing the moving performers and having re
freshments, -i â¢
On the beach at the left Is a large
dancing pavilion with forty couples of
dolls that actually waltzâ not simply go-
Ing around in a circle, but reversing from
time to time as they make a complete rev
olution of the waxed floor.
In a space more than 125 feet long the
beach and principal amusement features
of Coney Island, the famous New York
summer resort, have been faithfully re
produced. â¢
Along the ocean front a naval parade
moves majestically. The war vessels,
which are about three feet In length, are
excellent models of some of our own great
sea lighters, notably the Oregon and
Charleston, and those of other naval pow
ers. Their movements are so natural and
the'scenic effects so perfect â¢ that one
seems to be gazing out to sea and actu
ally witnessing the maneuvers of a squad
ron.
The finest mechanical holiday attraction
ever produced In America will be present
ed by; The Emporium and Golden Rule
Bazaar, beginning to-morrow. The chil
dren of this part of California anticipate
for months the Jolly time that they will
have When the Christmas exhibits of the
Emporium begin. If all of their wildest
dreams and more are not realized by the
spectacle for this holiday time the man
agement of the big- Market street, estab
lishment will not be to blame, for no ef
fort or expense has been spared to excel
anything of the kind ever seen in this city.
Beautiful Christmas Tableaux That
"Will Amuse Young and Old.
Open, To-Morrow.
WONDERFUL HOLIDAY SHOW.

Overdue Anglesey Arrives.
The British ship Anglesey, 165 days out
from Swansea, made port last night, ghe
carries a cargo of coal, and the under
writers were so afraid of her that . they
were paying 20 per cent reinsurance on
her when she was sighted. The captain
would not take a tow at first, and she lay
at anchor on the bar for nearly live hours.
Finally arrangements were made with one
of the tugs and the Anglesey came in.

THE British ship Glaucus that came
so close to Bolinas last Wednesday
reached port in safety. She was 128
days oHt from London and when ths
news came in that she was anchored
In Bolinas Bay in seven fathoms of water
a fleet of tugs at once went to her as
sistance. Captain Bennett was not look-
Ing for any assistance as he thought h's
ship perfectly safe. Later he got unde^
sail and stood down until he picked up a
pilot. Then the wind fell light again and
In the end he had to accept the services
of the tug Sea Queen.
"We made a fair weather trip of It
light up to November o," said Captain
Bennett yesterday. "Then the fog came
down and we saw no land for days. Point
Reyes we passed, but that fact I only
knew from the sound of the foghorn. : Wo
passed the point at 6 a. m. on the sth lnst.
I then^set our course for the whistling
buoy and when 1 run my distance up 1
thought I heard the whistle. I steered for
it and at 2:3') p. m., when there" was no
sign of the buoy and no land in sight, I
anchored In seven and a half fathoms of
water. An hour later the fog lifted and
I at once saw I was In Bolinas Bay.
"My ship was perfectly safe, so I lay
there all night and the next day 1 got un
der way and stood to the south. I took
Captain Erskine, the pilot, aboard and
later when the tug Sea Queen came along
I accepted a tow and came into port, i
don't see what they wanted to make a
wild and woolly story out of the affair
for."
The Glaucus is In fine trim and her
cargo is sure to turn out in the best of
order. â¢ " -

FOG NEARLY BRINGS
DESTRUCTION TO VESSELS
Steamer San Joapn
Runs Down Schooner
Margaret in the
Night.
THERE was nearly a fatality on th?
river Friday night. The fog was
very heavy and the scow-schooner
Margaret anchored' four miles be
low Vallejo. Captain and crew
never thought of danger and feeling cer
tain that nobody would steal the cargo
of broken rock they went to sleep and
snored in unison.
The river steamer. San Joaquin No. 4;
with two barges in tow, came along early
in the morning. The captain was feeling
his way and owing to the fog was a little
off his course. He was not expecting a
scow schooner without lights to bar his
way, however,' and in consequence the
San Joaquin nearly ran clear over the
Margaret. When the latter came to, at
an angle of 45 degrees, all her cargo of
rock went overboard and the foremast
went also. Then she escaped from under
the bow of the steamer and righted her
self. The captain and deckhand got on
deck in a hurry, but all they could do
was to get another anchor out and curse
their -luck. â¢
When the San Joaquin reached pori
yesterday the captain reported the mat
ter and the owner of the schooner at once
secured one of Peterson's launches and
went in search of his vessel. The chances
are that she has been badly stove and
that it will cost considerable money to
repair her.
The captain of the San Joaquin says
that he did not know there was. a boat
within miles of him until he was a. ship's
length away, from the schooner. Then he
ordered the engines full speed astern, but
it was too late to avoid a collision.

to Cure Every Fntror," f rÂ«\
WHAT CAUSES DEAFNESS.
The Principal Cause Is Curable but
Generally Overlooked.
Many things \ may cause deafness, and
very often it is difficult to trace a cause.
Some people inherit deafness. Acute! dis-
eases like scarlet fever sometimes cause
deafness. . But by far the most. common
cause of loss of hearing is catarrh of the
head and throat.
A prominent specialist on ear troubles
gives as his opinion that nine out of ten
cases cf deafness are traced to throat
trouble; this is probably overstated, but
It is certainly true that more than half of
all cases of poor hearing were caused by
catarrh. " ." â¢ .
The catarrhal secretion in the nose and
throat finds its way into the eustachlan
tube and by clogging it up very soon af-
fects the hearing and the hardening of the
secretion makes the loss of hearing per-
manent, unless the catarrh which cause J
the trouble is cured. Â»
Those who are hard of hearing may
think this a little far fetched, but any one
at all observant must have noticed how
a hard cold in the head will affect the
hearing and that catarrh if long neglected
will certainly impair the sense of hearing
and ultimately cause deafness.
If the nose and throat are kept clear
and free from the unhealthy secretions
of catarrh, the hearing will at once r.reat-
ly improve and any one suffering from
deafness and catarrh can satisfy them-
selves on this point by using a 50-cent
box of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, a new
catarrh cure, which in the past year ha3
won the approval of thousands of catarrh
sufferers, as well as physicians, because
It Is in convenient Â» form 7 to use, contains
r.o cocaine or opiate and is as safe/ and
pleasant for children as for their elders.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets Is a : wÂ£olesQjne
combination of Blood Root, Gualacol,' En-
caluptoj and similar antiseptics and they-
cure catarrh and catarrhal deafness by
action upon the. blood and mucous. mem-
brane of the nose, and throat.
As one physician aptly expresses It:
"You do not have to draw upon the
imagination to discover whether you are
getting benefit-', from - Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets; improvement and relief are ap-
parent from the' first tablet taken."
All druggists sell and recommend them.
They cost but 60 cents for. full sized pack-
age and any '. catarrh sufferer who -has
wasted ;time and money on sprays, salves
and powders will appreciate to the full
the merit of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets.

SENSATION
ON STAGE
OF TIVOLI
Â»
Brutal Insult to
Women Resent
ed by Russo.
"I have traveled all over the United
States and I had to come to this city and
read the Examiner to learn that an Amer
ican can insult a woman. In that news
paper you have two qualities which offend
ineâ blackguardism and untruth."
These -words created a sensation yester
day afternoon. They were .spoken" from
the stage of the Tlvoll Opera-house by
Domenlco Russo, the clever singer who
has charmed thousands of San Francis
cans for many weeks. The speaker spoke
seriously, excitedly and sincerely, and his
words meant that the little yellow rascal
of local journalism has been at his tricks
again.
Russo's address, delivered by him hi de
fiance of the management of the theater
when the curtain had fallen after the first
act of the matinee performance of "Car
men." provoked a storm of applause which
has seldom been heard in the house. The
little tenor had struck a chord of. sym
pathy by his protest and he had good
reason to speak. Tho Examiner had out
saffroned itself the day before by pub
lishing a brutal attack upon two of the
women members of the company now
sipping at the Tivoll. In a scandalous
article, marked as emphatically by its in
decency as by its falsehood, the names of
Signorlna Lia Polletinl and Signorlna
Stefanla Collamarini were "associated by
the Examiner with that of Russo.
The little tenor doesn't speak good Eng
lish. Many a shrug and gesture, not a
little pantomime and a sprinkling of Ital
ian must be translated Into a meaning of
indignation and protest in English, but
when he appeared yesterday afternoon on
the stage of the Tivoll in the costume of
Don Jose and the personality of Rus3O
few misunderstood him. He brushed his
way before the curtain "and to the aston
ished audience began his protest.
"I do not understand your language
very well, ladies and gentlemen." he said,
"but I want to speak a few words in be
half of two women of this company. You
have a newspaper in this city, the Exam
mer "_and the speaker was fumbling for
a slip of paperâ "which is a dishonor to
you. It~has published a He about two
women. They can find no redress, but In
their behalf I want to sav"â and Russo
stopped for a moment: He had found
what he sought, and continued:
"I want to say," he continued, "that the
man who wrote the outrageous slander
in the Examiner and the man who per
mitted It to be published are insolent, im
postors, false, slanderers, imbeciles,
mean, infamous, vile ar.d cowards."
The little tenor was bristling with rage,

Grau has come to the front .as an Im

Gran Company Renders "Lohengrin"
and "Romeo and Juliet."
LOS ANGELES. Nov. 11.â It was almost
midnight when the last bars of "Lohen
grin" were sung before the biggest audi
ence of the Grau Company's brief but
glorious engagement. Hazard's Pavilion,
with a seating capacity of 3300, was pack
ed to the doors, and enthusiastic plaudits
rewarded Damrcsch and the superb sing
ers and the splendid orchestra that he led.
"Lohengrin" wa3 the choice of the ma
jority of the Angelenoa. and thÂ© receipt3
of the single performance were In the
neighborhood of $10,000.
Despite the fact that the mercury hov
ered around 90 degrees, the matinee at
which Gounod's ''Romeo and Juliet"
was given was well attended and a bril
liant performance resulted. Suzanne
Adams as Juliet not only saner splendid
ly but has remarkable magnetism, which
made her a prime favorite with her audi
ence from her first appearance. The
greatest feature of the production was
the magnificent singing 1 of Pol Plancon
as Friar Lawrence. His wonderful tones
enthralled every soul In the vast building.
The Romeo was Imbart de la Tour, a
heavy person, but a splendid singer.
Carrie Bridewell, an Alabama girl, who
for some time has been under Sembrich's
wing, donned the doublet and hose of
Stephano for the first time and mado the
most of her single opportunity in the
third act. Miss Bridewell has rare nat
ural gifts and temperament besides. Her
admirers believe that she will develop
into America's greatest contralto.
At the evening performance Nordica in
sisted that Daxnrosch should do the hon
ors with her, and she. literally dragged
him. still reluctant, from the wings to
acknowledge the peals of applause that
followed the first act of "Lohengrin."
Nordica was in splendid voice and knew
it. Like Melba, who declared to-day that
she hud never sun? better In her life than
last night, she attributes it to the fact
that she has enjoyed a long rest.
Dippel's Lohengrin is a masterpiece
In every way he is suited to the role and
was eciual to its tremendous demands.

Postal Clerk Charged With. Bobbing
Mall Said to Have Taken
Brother's Name.
Postal Clerk Peter J. Cunane of Station
D, who was arrested by Inspector Brlcker
at half-past 1 o'clock yesterday morning,
as told in The Call, was turned over to
the custody of United States Marshal
Shine yesterday forenoon. Cunane made
a desperate fight when Inspector Bricker
caught him in the act of stealing a S3
cold piece from a letter. In the struggle
some of the furniture and much of the
wlndcw glass in the room were broken.
Small sums of money had been missing
from time to time during several weeks
past and by methods known to the post
office inspectors the leakage was traced
to Cunane's department. A decoy letter
with a genuine five-dollar piece inclosed
was sent into Curve's department, and
Urirker who was concealed In tne room,
pounced upon the clerk after he had cut
op"n the letter. The clerk was subdued
only after other clerks had gone to the
assistance of the inspector.
The prisoner passed the civil service ex
amination and was appointed In March.
CONSTANT STUDY CAUSES
NERVOUS PROSTRATION
Soldier Works Hard for a Commis

the Strain. . Â¦ \
A great deal of sympathy is expressed
in army circles for Lieutenant Jackson,
who has been granted leave of absence
for thirty days in order that he might re
ceive treatment at a private sanitarium
for nervous prostration. In his case it is
thought a more rapid cure can be effected
by removal from an army hospital.
Lieutenant Jackson was formerly a sol
dier in the ranks and paw. much service in
the Philippines and Cuba. His , conduct
attracted the attention of. his superiors
and he was urged to study and apply for
a commission. He transferred to the hos
pital corps in order to have better facili
ties for study and after a year's service
In that branch went before the board. He
passed a most successful examination and
received an appointment as second lieu
tenant. The strain of - constant study
however, has wrecked his nervous sys
tem. Two -weeks after he donned his sol-"
dler straps he sent in his resignation, but
no heed was paid to *t. His condition 1 is
not serious, but -he "will require careful
treatment. -

MBS. ELIZABETH O^IELIÂ»Y *
PASSES QUIETLY AWAY
Had Reached the Ripe Old Age of
One Hundred and Two
Years.
I told you that we would break open the
vaults In which the gold dust had been stored
and that I was going off to get ready for the
fight. At the time the vaults were broken open
McKenzie was a prisoner In custody of the
Deputy United States Marshals and he was
afterward brought to the bank to assist us In
identifying the gold bags. m
I Mr. Metson next narrated an exciting
conversation he had had with Mr. Mc-
Kenzie with reference to some gold dust
that was in the sluice boxes on the Dis
covery claim on the day on which his
clients took possession of the claim Mr
McKenzie notified Mr. Metson that * he
wished to clean up the gold dust, Mr
Metson replied that his clients were very
careful people and would clean ut> the
boxes without letting any of the gold tret
away. McKenzie charged Mr. Metson'a
clients with trying to steal the gold and
he asked the soldiers to protect him while
he cleaned up the boxes. Warm words
passed between Metson and McKenzie on
that occasion, and for a, time, said Mr
Metson. It looked as though there mieht
be a personal encounter between the two
peculiar actions of United States
District Attorney Woods were then nar
rated; by Mr. Metson. He testified that
when a demand was made for the keys of
the vault Mr. Woods declined to surrender
them. He -was then threatened by thÂ»
Deputy United States Marshals that if
he did not give up the keys they would
break the boxes. Woods told Mr. Metson
on that occasion that he would think
about it and added. "Let them sro an with
I thought, Mr. Geary, that you were connu
biatlng to set a receiver appointed in another
case and that you would take that gold dust
away from me. I had seen Judge Noyes go up
into Mr. Geary's offite on that same day. and
United States District Attorney Joseph Woods
was there also. I thereupon went downtown
and hitched on a gatling gun.
In response toa question as to whether
he had not always carried "a gatllng
gun on his rerson In Nome the witness
said that he had not U P to th at time, as
he did not care to be clapped In Jail for
violating the law.
Mr. Metson continued:
Then Mr, Geary and I had another talk, and
he Intimated that McKenzie was not going to
yield He said that be had advised McKenzie
to give up the gold dust and that McKenile
had said that he would not do It without a
fight, and that if I persisted in taking the gold
dust four or five men might be killed and I
might be among those killed, and If I was not
I would be responsible for the deaths of the
men killed. I told Mr. Geary that I had laid
down with one writ behind me: that I had
yielded to the writs Issued by Judge Noyes and
I didn't think it was right to my people to
surrender the second writ of supersedeas when
the United States Marshal waa there to enforce
It. Then I Informed you that I was going to
proceed to open fire. You. Mr. Geary, said that
you didn't propose to go into any row yourself
and that you had not been employed as a gun
fighter.
back between 1 and 2 o'clock and I and Mr. Du
bose had a talk about the mistake he made
in constrains the writs, and he admitted that
the writs ought to be obeyed ; that he was will
ing to acknowledge his mistakes and waa sorry
for them. â¢
Ex-Consressraan Geary worked very
hard yesterday forenoon . before United
States Court Commissioner Heacock to
exclude some of the testimony of Lawyer
W. H. Metson in the Dubose contempt
"case. But all his efforts in that direction
were parried by E. S. Pillsbury. â¢
Mr. - Metson's testimony was dam
aging to Mr. Geary's client. Receiver Mc-
Kenzie, and Mr. Geary on cross-examina
tion exerted his skill to the utmost to
break the force of the statements made
by the witness, but Mr. Pillsbury. on the
redirect examination rendered all those
effort3 abortive. Then Mr. Geary, pro
ceeded to object to many' of the soul
searching, .bedrock questions put by Mr.
Pillsbury and demanded j that the -Com
missioner certify to the questions and ob
tain a ruling from" United States Circuit
Judge Morrow as to their admlsslbllity.
But Judge Morrow had gone out of town
and Commissioner Heacock ruled that he
would follow his usual procedure of &l
lowing the witness to answer all the
quesUonsV whether objected to or not
and leave to Judge Morrow the task of
striking out- or allowing the answers to
6 t^ow Attorney Dudley
smaller l^fUS? se^edÂ°upKJ a
cfients. Mr. Dubose had argued that the
supersedeas might stay the hands of the
receiver,' but that it could not direct,le
gally the return of the personal property
to the defendant. In that regard the
writ was void, according to Mr. Duboses
contention. On the same proposition,
continued Mr. Metson. Mr. Geary had
argued that, as long as the realty, was
surrendered to the defendant, the^ writ or
supersedeas had been complied and
that thi writ could not require the return
of the gold taken from the mines before
that document had been, issued. . ~L.
Â¦ With reference to the threats ; said to
have been made- _by McKenzie' s party
that blood would flow should the deputy
United 'States: -marshals seize the gold
dust in the . receiver's â¢ possession, Mr.
Metson testified: ._Â¦
When I first *iaw" Mr. Geary on that : occasion
I told him that Mr. McKenzie ,waa under ar
io.t Judsra Dubose > was with Mr. McKenzle
LTthat time, and Mr." Geary.' the Deputy United
states Marshal' from San Francisco, and United
t}. fM ' District Attorney Woods Â¦-Â¦ were In â¢ the
rornn' Mr.' Geary i told > me that Mr. McKenzie
was very much , excited and that . he . believed
?hot the court was wrong and that he had no
idea that the - United States Circuit Court S of
ADDeals would sustain the action of Judge Mor-
In%i with reference to the first .writ of superae
deaa which reached Nome , about the 14th of
September. "Mr. Geary said further that he had
advised McKenzie to obey the .writs, Â¦ but that

VICTIM OF THE SHOCKING MURDER IN CHINATOWN AND THE TWO
PERSONS BELIEVED BY THE rOLICE TO HAVE COMMITTED THE
ATROCIOUS CRIME.
the audience was on the verge of cheer
ing. Russo' was reading from a slip of
paper which he held in his hand. He had
sought a dictionary for English words
with which to express his denunciation of
tho newspaper outrage, arid the audience
was on the verge of cheering because he
had not found a word forceful enough i to
express their thought of the yellow sheet
and it3" sensationalism.
Russo finished his address and as far
as the stage of the Tlvoll was concerned
the incident was closed. He was seen
afterward and was In a mood not alone to
talk, but to act.
"I have used every effort I know," he
said, "to resent this outrage. I do not
speak your language with fluency, but I
have seen enough of Americans to know
thnt they resent as I do an unwarranted,
brutal insult to women. For myself I do
not careâ I am able to take care of my
self even against \ American newspaper
scoundrels. I have sent my card to the
Examiner office and know that I will re
ceive none in return. Men who Insult
women do not fight men."
i And Russo was the picture of contempt.
With many a gesticulation, with the elab
orate language of the hands, with expres
sions which must have been severe in
Italian, he said he was willing to fight the
Yellow Kid in all his variety with any
thing from baseball bats to fists. As the
tenor is an; expert swordsman, a dead
shot, an accomplished boxer and a' vet
eran athlete his threat and offer meant
something-. â¢?'_-Â¦ , ; â¢Â¦ .
"But what can I do? 'he added. "How
do Americans treat with such black
guards? How can I discuss' the names of
women in such an encounter? These wo
men I have met; they have been tny as
sociates on the f stage; -I have acted with
them and admire In them what I; hope
they see in meâ the spirit of an artist
Can I use. their. names because a. rascal
has done so?" ;._
If Russo does not know how, to meet the
problem of the Yellow Kid's existence Sig
norina Lia' Polletlni does. She. is the lit
tle woman whose Binglng and acting have
won her well-deserved . praise. She 'says
that she has a reputation which the Ex
aminer is not privileged to take from her
and yesterday she consulted with a firm
of attorneys, determined .to bring 'a; suit
for libel against the Examiner. She has
much, upon which -to base her action and

their burglary and break the boxes." Mr.
Metson continued:
I was credibly informed that Hubbard and
Dubcsjs had a scheme to have McKenzie ap
pointed receiver In another case so that he
might take away the gold dust from oar clients.
United States Attorney Woods was advising
McKer.zIe and 'assisting him.- and he was one
of JIcKenzie' s active partisans. I know that
Woods did everything: that he could to defeat
us. I heard that he tvouM try to get the Grand
Jury to Indict us. On one occasion in court
when I asked for an order directing McKenzte
to comply, with the first writ of supersedes* In
the Chippa case, and tarn over, the gold dust to
the. defendants. Mr. Woods 'sprang to his feet
and said that' he didn't propose to yield the
business of the United States: to us any more.
He -thereupon- objected to the presentation of
the motion and the court ruled with him. Mr.
Woods acted in the same wey ta the Judge's
chambers on another occasion. I understood
that he was going to have my clients and Judge
Johnson and Judge Jackson indicted. Judge
Noyes made an order in the Chlpps case to take
aflray from the defendants everything they
possessed at the time the receiver went Into
possession of Discovery claim. The order mad.)
a clean scoop of all their personal property.
Robert Chlpps of Chicago and recently
from Nome was put on the stand by Mr.
Pillsbury. He denied that he ever em
ployed Mr. Dubose to act as his counsel.
He understood that Dubose was the attor
ney for McKenzie. Mr. Dubose had in
formed him that it would not be necessary
to grive up the g*>ld dust." that the court
had no Jurisdiction in the matter and that
the papers were not right. Mr. Dubose
had Informed the witness that the clerk
of the court, in writing the order, had at
tached more to the order than the Judge
had told him to.
At this stage of the proceedings an ad
journment was taken until Monday morn-
Ing at 11 o'clock.
METSON TELLS HOW HE WAS FORCED
TO "HITCH ON A GATLING GUN" AT NOME
Lue Dock, who Is employed as a cook In
a saloon at 506 Market street, and "a Chi
nese woman who is known as Ah v Moey
and charged them with the murder.
The woman, who is e notorious slave
dealer, owed the murdered man over $700,
and as he threatened to make trouble for
her unless she refunded the amount the
police believe that she induced Dock
who is her lover, to put him out of the
way. After committing the horrible
crime the murderer broke open two trunk *
belonging to his victim and thoroughlv
searched them for valuables. He als'a
open a small wooden box, which v.-as sup
posed to have contained some money,
ar.d stole the contents. When the police
entered the place they found two empty
purses on the floor, which were subse
quently identified as being the property
of the murdered man. It is supposed thac
they had contained considerable money,
as Hcng was in the iiabit of carrying a
large amount on his person.
Shortly after 5 o'clock yesterday after
noon the Chinese woman, who is under
arrest, went to the office of Dr. Wong
Woo at 764 Clay street and excitedly in
formed him that she believed the Chinese
cobbler had met with foul play. She de
clared that she had visited his shop and
found that the place had been ransacked,
presumably by robbers.
The Chinese doctor, suspecting some
thing wrong, accompanied the woman to
the place, where they were met by Po
lice Ofiieera Dougherty and Herri n. On
entering the shop, which is in a basement,
the woman nervously lighted a candle and
ltd the way to the rear of the place. Ly
ing on the floor, his head resting against
an oid stove, was th<; murdered man.
With a scream the woman, presumably
horrlned by the ghastly wound In his
throat, started to leave the shop. She
was, stopped by Detective Gibson and
piaced under arrest. She denied that she
knew anything about the murder.- but
despite her protestations of innocence she
T/as escorted to the City Prison and
lecked up. Shortly after the body had
bc-en taken to the Morgue Sergeant
Brophy and squad arrested the woman's
lover in the Globe Hotel on Jackson
street, where he was in hiding, and took
him to police headquarters. Blood was
found on the sleeve of his coat as well
as on a. silk shirt which he wore. He
tried to explain away the damaging evi
dence by claiming that he had cut his
ringer some time ago and wiped the blood
on hla sleeve and shirt. He could not tell
which flnser had been cut, as it "was so
long ago."
The police are satisfied that Dock, as
sisted by the woman, committed the hor
rible deed. They believe that the unfor
tunate cobbler was preparing his noon
day meal when the murderer, after en
gaging him In conversation, attacked him
with the cleaver, inflicting the wounds
which caused his death Immediately after
ward. From the condition of the body
Coroner Cole is satisfied that the murder
was committed at least four hours before
the body was discovered.

f I \ HAT the University of Califor-
I nla eleven must make remark-
I able improvement during tho
* twenty days which elapse before
they meet in annual contest
with the athletes who sport the cardinal
Jersey Is the opinion of every . follower
of football who saw the Berkeley students
do battle with the Reliance team on the
gridiron yesterday afternoon.
That California did not suffer a defeat
was not due to superior playing, but to
the crippled condition of the Reliance
team. Despite their condition the. club
men were able to bring the oval to within
two feet of their opponent's goal posts at
one stage of the game and at another to
force the ball to the college men's 10-yard
line. In the opinion of many this pcr- i
formance alone was a virtual victory for
the Reliance team. When It is taken into
consideration that Stanford a week before
rolled up a score of 44 points against the
Reliance eleven the showing made by the
University of California was \ decidedly
weak, and if there was any betting at this
early date Stanford would be favorite over
California at odds of 5 to 1.
California won the game by a score of
11 to Reliance's 0. The eleven points wer^j
made bv one man and his name is Johnny
More. The flrst five points were scored
by him in the ilrst half when, with a few
minutes to play, he stepped far back on
the 85-yard line and booted the oval over
the goal posts. The drop jvick was a gejii
in its way and surpassed even that madÂ«.Â«
by Joe Tobin many years ago. The ball
bounded from Johnny's foot and sped
toward the goal posts and went over the
bar as true as a dart. The yell which
arose from the Berkeley rooters would
have startled a deaf man and it lasted
fully five minutes.
In the second half the college eleven,
through heavy plunges by Overall, "Lo
comoter" Smith and Gammon, worked th*
leather to the center of the field. Gam
mon, who had just entered the game in
Mini's place, played like a. demon. He
shot through holes and made substantial
gains. He cut loose at that Juncture and
skirted the right end for twenty yards.
Smith then ploughed through for ten more
and the ball was within scorlnf distance.
The playing became fiercer on both tides
and men were laid out after every scrim
mage. Reliance stayed California's ad
vance for two downs and thii.gs looked
bad for Berkeley. Womble, w..o was giv
ing the signals, had to chanre three time3
before the right play suited Smith. The
i>ail was passed to "Loccmotor" and he
dodged through right end and tackle anJ
over the line for a touchdown, but
dropped the ball. Fortunately for the
halfback Johnny More was at his heels
and fell on the pigskin.
The flrst half of the game was uninter
esting. California was compelled to kick
repeatedly on third down and at one
stage More tried, a'drop kick from field,
but failed. The college eleven played; very
slow ball and showed a tendency to fum
ble at critical moments, and this was dis
appointing to its admirers. â¢ â¢
Both teams took.- on a lease of !ife in
the second half. â¢ The talking: they re
ceived from their, . respective coaches'
must have counted, for the players wen*,
into the. game with greater zest.
Rodolph kicked on to ..lore. Who was
downed in his tracks by Atkinson. Cali
fornia worked the- bait 'to ' the center of
the field and lopt it for holding in the
line. Reliance then played a bucking
game. Monroe, the giant guard with
"piano legs," was given the oval and he
battered his way through Stowe and Cas
tlehun for gains, bringing the ball to
within five yards of California's goal 1
posts. California fought desperately an<1
stopped the invaders for two downs. Ro
dolph displayed bad judgment at this
stage- of the game in .notÂ»giving Monroe
the ball. Had he done so Reliance wouid
have scored a touchdown. As it was one
of the backs took the ball and butted hi?
head .against an iron wall. Clay was laid
out and O'Toolc took his place in th<3
line. More kicked to -the center of the
field and Reliance again resumed buck
ing tactics, using Monroe and Atkinson
for battering rams. The ball was worked
to the 10-yard line and again the Califor
nia team held. Braley gave way to Over
all and then the college boys . began to
play as they should have played earlier
Inthe game.- Reliance's line was torn up
and gains were made by Hudson, Smith.
Overall, Womble and Gammon. The ball
was brought to Reliance's 7-yard line
only to be lost on downs. ; Rodolph kicked
to the center of the field and Gammon
by a fast run brought it in back fifteen
yards. Dinsmore was rendered hors du
combat In tackling the runner and was
virtually out of 'the.' game. Varney, who
has his upper teeth loosenedVearlie'r in the
day, fought to take his place, but as his
condition was even worse he was kept off
the field. Dinsmore piucklly resumed th*i
conflict. California could not be stayed

The first two innings were quick and
snappy, but not bat noisy. In the third
the ice cake was shattered when Levy,
who went to first on four bad ones, second
on Reilly'a sacrifice, crossed the rubber
when Brockhoff drove the ball along
first base line to right field. In the fourth
Hildebrand got into the running on bad,
fielding by Doyle, stole second and found !
the plate easy on a three-bagger by Pabst.
In the fifth , Sacramento was within
reach of a score. Hanlon, McLaughlln and
Devereaux were on the bags and but one
man dead. But the shot fired at Deve
reaux, and which put him out of
business for a few seconds, proved in no
way a mascot, and the Senators died as
they stood. In the . eighth Reilly and
Iburg scored. The score:
Iburg, cavorting on the slab for the
home team, pitched such knotty ball that
the Senators were unable to untie his de
livery. Two isolated hits were all that he
allowed the champions. Doyle was not so
good. In the fourth and eighth innings
small bunches were gathered In by the
locals, several of whom passed over the
rubber. "-;-â<â¢:.Â¦'., -V

A T the run-down of the bigr 128
1 /\. dog: open stake yesterday at
'/ \ Union Park there were many
X J^ good courses, and with the fast
ones which are still in tho run
ning some great sport is looked for in the
struggle for final honors in the closing
rounds to-day.
Palo Alto Is in good position and is in
favor for first place. Bohe Is figured as
a likely candidate and will make It inter
esting for some of the fast ones at the
bottom of the card.
Mose did good work and is in trim to
give fast Palo Alto a hard go when they
meet, especially if they are slipped to a
strong hare. Tyrone Prince and Belle
Rocket should put up a good course. Wild
Tralee will be a favorite over Iowa Boy,
though the Boy will make a hard strug
gle for the flag.
Mike Fenton, for the first time oat.
showed considerable speed against Miss
Skyrocket. It is not likely that he Will
get near the deciding course to-day, owing
to inexperience, though he will probably
do some good work in the future. Auck
land showed well and is figured a winner
in his first course; to-day. Red Angus
had a long go with Ben Kirby, allowing
the latter to. score but 1 point against
his 13. He has the speed and is due to
make a great showing in any stake,
though of course lack of experience may
tell against the youngster.
The short ends were: Lady Claire beat
Lovina, Belle Rocket beat Bonnie Pasha,
Wedgewood beat Best Bargain at 5 to 3;

Y yf some splendid sport over
' a fast course attracted
fully OW0 people to Oakland track yester
day. Besides the regular menu furnished,
the Produce Exchange stake, for two
year-olfis, had a place on the programme,
and to the popular horseman Walter Jen
nings belongs the honor of capturing the
first classic feature of the winter season.
His fast Midlothian colt Canmore, which
up to the time of the State Fair was an
unknown quantity, lowered the colors of
Green Morris* crack youngster Bedeck, a
eon of the statuesque Star Ruby, in a
prettily fought contest. The latter colt
had Wedderstrand In the saddle, and
throughout the betting, which was fast
end furiou?. held the honors of favorit
ism, with Canmore second choice. Ap
parently Homage and Diderot had not
been doing well, for neither was accorded
much attention from speculators. With
very little delay at the post Mr. Caldwell
released the barrier to an excellent start.
Bedeck at once went out to make the
pace, closely followed by Canmore, Hom
age and Diderot. The last named two re
tired after a brief effort, leaving Canmore
â¢ar.d Bedeck to light it out. As the leaders

Mounce had Car.more under gentle re
straint, and barring accident looked the

Bedeck weakened, and Wedderstrand in a
fruitless effort to hold the lead bore out
perceptibly, bumping and interfering with
the Jennings entry. Seeing that he had
the race in hand, Mounce laid his whip
away, and hand riding passed the Judges

covered in 1:14, which, considering the
successful two-ytar-old carried 113 pounds.

horse is a notorious mudlark, but yester
day very few gave him a thought. Miss
Rowena. the 6 to 5 favorite, was consid
ered a "pipe," and the coin poured Into
the books on the mare. At the start
Buchanan hustled Jerry away in the lead,
and though Wedderetrand on the favorite

of hard luck, with the result that the fa
vorite finished third. Coburn astride Tor-

poor racing luck, and The Fretter, should

a remarkably good race. Much was ex

Although it Is generally understood that
Charles M. Hays, the newly elected presi
dent of the -Southern Pacitlc. will devote
himself more particularly to the operating
side of the big road than to the financial,
it is interesting to note the wonderful
advance in the financial standing of the
Grand Trunk that has been made since
Mr. Hays became its general manager five
years ago. â¢
â¢ For eleven years out of the preceding
fourteen there had been an annual de
ficit, the only dividend payments having
been on the guaranteed stock, and none
on that stock after 1893. During Mr. Hays*
administration the gross earnings on prac
tically the same mileage have increased
from $17,000,000 in 1S95 to $21,000,000 last
year, and the net revenue has been in
creased by nearly $2,500,000.

A rumor has reached the ears of the
ladies afnl'ated with the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals that
the yacht Frolic Is being fitted out at
Sausallto for the purpose of hunting all
sorts of waterfowl the feathers of which
are valued as adornments for ladies' hats,
and they have determined to stop the
slaughter of Innocents.
To carry their point the ladles have de
termined on a heroic course. They wlU
sacrifice vanity to conscience to save the
feathered creatures and have announced
that if the Frolic goes forth on her errand
of death they will each and every one
of them abstain from wearing any feath
ers in their hats.
So earnest are the ladies ln this cam
paign that they have enlisted the assist
ance of Secretary Holbrook of the local
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals and he ln 'turn has called the
attention of each local branch of the so
ciety in coast ports to the possible ob
jects of the Frolic's voyage and bade the
members thereof stay the wanton slaugh
ter of the birds of plumage. : .
When the Frolic will sail, or what may
be the outcome of the trip. Is yet a ques
tion. State and Federal laws are against
the venture, but how they, may best be
applied Is a question. The plumes, wings,
aigrettes and other feathered flippery that
the Frolic may brinj? to port may as well
be thrown overboard, for all the use they
will be in the local millinery market, for
not a feather, a wing, or a plume will the
ladles of the society wear upon their hats
after the cruise of the Frolic. .

of Interest among railroad men as to the
course the initial companies will pursue
pending a decision by The Interstate Com
mission.
Vice President J. C. Stubbs said yester
day that in so- far as the Southern Pacific
la concerned the same plan followed last
year will be adopted this year.
The complainants ln their brief which
waa filed In. September claim that thÂ»
Continental Fruit Express and tha Earl
Fruit Company have been given prefer
ence and advantage over their competi
tors, but no argument or relation of evi
dence la made to show how these agree
ments Â¦work to the prejudice or disadvan
tage of the complainants.
The Southern Pacific In the brief first
filed says that it Is evident from all the
testimony that the idea of the contract
with the- Continental Fruit Express belns
a prejudice or disadvantage to tha com
plainants and other shippers was largely
worked up after shippers were notified
that the initial carriers would exercise
the right of routing.
Vice President Stubbs says that the
sole reason for exercising the right cf
routing was that those who -routed the
freight previously were holding up tha
carriers for rebates or concessions as a
consideration for sending- the goods over
their particular routea.
"These concessions could not be ob
tained except by people having: the right
of routing, added Mr. Stubbs. "I think
there has been no particular traQo in tha
United States that has ever been so open
ly and notoriously bandied In this way as
the citrus fruit traffic of Southern Cali
fornia. The routing: by us has pat a stop
to these rebates."
The brief concludes by stating: that the
complainants' brief adds nothing to the
oral argument as to* the alleged pooling
agreement, nor as to the alleged unreas
onableness of the rate of $1 25 per hun
dredweight. The mere fact that the rate
was the same when the traffic waa small
and has not been reduced since the traf
fic has Increased furnishes no argument
against the rate, unless It were shown
that the rate was entirely compensatory
for the original small volume of traffic.
Prior to last year the Southern Califor
nia Fruit Exchange and the Consolidated
Forwarding Company did most of tha
routing: of oranges and lemons. Last
year, however, the. initial companies re
fused to recognize the shippers, and tha
crop was sent over as many different
lines as the Southern Pacific and Santa
Fe chose to select
The action against the two railroad cor
porations waa brought last spring, being
precipitated by the. alleged failure on tha
part of the two roads to furnish proper
and adequate equipment at all times for
the movement of the citrus fruits in
Southern California.
The Southern Pacific Company has filed
its final brief with the Interstate Com
merce Commission ln thÂ« case of tha

now filed their briefs and an early deci

They point to the central location of the

When Mullen got to the store he saw-
Melluish watching Â¦ him from the second
story window. He beckoned to him, and
that attracted the attention of some
passers"-by. "It's a burglar," said \ one.
"The place is on fire," said another, while
a third insisted "It's an escaped lunatic."
Then all began to advise the policeman,
and while the talk went on the crowd
grew. Soon there were 500 people on the
sidewalk, ami these numbers soon grew to
1000. and Mullen had to send for assistance
to get the crowd to move on.
While a ladder was being: procured to
get Melluish from the second story to the
ground a sailor iynned O. Olson came
along and volunteered to take a rope up
the water pipe to the tire escape. He went*
up the piece of piping like a professional

ranged on the sides. Work of preparing:
the court will commence soon, and It will
be ready for occupancy by the first of

In some regards this musician in minia
ture is the most wonderful of all the won
der children, not even excepting Paloma
Schramm, and like her even her faults
lean to virtue's side. Little Knid has not
the unusual beauty of tone, the gracious
and poetic interpretation of her charming
little rival, nor aoÂ»s she show the creative
faculty to anything like the same high
extent: but her technique, from the purely
mechanical standpoint, Is even now much
more brilliant and Comprehensive, and
her repertoire is practically unlimited.
The faculty nf absolute pitch both chil

development of. these two radically differ

Thursday's programme included two

the most astonishing performance in lft
tle Enid's repertoire, the Mendelssohn
"Rondo Capriccioso." and one can only

the difficult phrases, runs, octaves and
arpeggios with a mature power and large
grasp that would do ample credit to a mu

Mr. and Mrs. Noah Brandt, themselves
well-known musicians In San Francisco,
are to be congratulated on the possession
of an undoubted genius in their little
daughter, and to Mrs. Brandt is due the
considerable credit of her musical educa

The debut and recital appearances of

wonder child will be long remembered by
every member of each of her audiences.
The Damrosch recitals of Monday and
Wednesday last, on the third and final
numbers .of .the "Ring." "Siegfried" and
"Die Gotterdammerung," were even more
interesting and more enjoyable than the
preceding lectures, as one became accus
tomed to the peculiar timbre of the lec
turer's voice. Mr. Damrosch ls In keenest
sympathy with his subject, and has a
broad and comprehensive grasp of the ele
mental and eternal philosophy around
which Wagner has woven the heroic ro
mance of the "Ring," and a subtle and
delicate appreciation of Its magnificent
poetry. It goes without saying that those
fortunate enough to have heard this
course of lectures will find their first
hearing of the "Ring" infinitely more
pleasurable. ,

During- the past week Mrs. Ema Gett
of Ca'lf.a Parlcr of Sacramento, grand
prcslfier.t of the Native Daughters of thÂ«
Golden West, was In this city paying of
ficial visits to local parlors. During her
tour of visitations she was accompanied
by Past Grand Presidents Mrs. Belle W.
Â»'or.rad. Miss Mae B. Wilkin and Mrs.
I>na Hilke Mills. Grand Vice President
Mrs. Genevieve Baker. Past Grand Treas
urer Miss Eliza D. Keith, several of thj
district deputies and a number of local
bright lights of the order.
At Darina Parlor on Monday the visitor
vas received by a. large number of the
beautiful girls of the Western Addition.
The officers demonstrated In a most satis
factory manner their ability to perform
the work of the order as to business and
rltuaj. The grand president was present
ed a dainty souvenir spoon and the vice
president and district deputy, Mrs. J. A.
feteinbach, a bunch of choice flowers each.
end then there was a collation, at which
there were short addresses by the visit
ing- officials and a taik by the Na,tive
Daughters' friend.
On Tuesday right Mrs. Gett visited O:o
Fino Parlor, but the attendance of mem
bers was not as large as -was noted on
previous visits. This was deemed strange,
as this parlor cf charming ladies certainly
has a membership that ought to feÂ»l
proud to appear before the highest officer
of the order. There was an exemplifica
tion of the work arrl remarks bv the
grand president, by Mrs. Conrad. Mrs. L.
H. Mills. MrÂ«. Theodore Lunstedt. Mrs.
Arthur D. Coddington, Mrs. Rebeka Kemp
Van Ee and Miss McAllister. After the
T-.-ork of the evrning th<Te -was a collation.
On Wednesday night the grand presi
dent. Mrs. Conrad and Mrs. Emma Thier
bach cf La Estrella Parlor visited the
always very hospitable and wide-awake
parlor, but the attendance was very small.
The committee that had charge of the
arrangements for the reception of the
grand officers had made extensive prep
arations for the event. They decorated
the meeting place with garlands of esch
echoltzias end patriotic colors, but there
were not as many there as were expected.
The officers were praisÂ«d for their work
and the praise was well deserved.
On Thursday night the visit to Orinda.
the bor.ton parlor of the order in this
city, was one that was calculated to en
thuse the grand president and those who
accompanied her. The hall was tastefully
flecorated with flowers. There -were more

fection and they hope 'o 6how that ama

dent Mrs. Agnes Lunstedt, assisted by
Mr* Arthur D. Coddington of Orinda Par
lor. Mrs. Olsen of Sans Soud parlor, Mrs.

Mr. Thomas E. Wood of S18 Seventeenth
street. Sacramento, Cal., writes: "It af-
fords me much pleasure to state that af-
â¢ter using only one 50-cent box of Pyramid
Pile Cure I was cured of the painful and
annoying disease, after having suffered
from piles, for thirty years and tried
everything and could only get temporary
relief. I was advised by two of the best
physicians in California to have an oper-
ation and I did and suffered iilmost death
but the piles returned and my suffering
at times was so great I was not able to
walk until I saw an advertisement of the
Pyramid Pile Cure. I got it at once and
was relieved from the nrst application. I
am so grateful that I â¢ feel like recom-
mending it to any and every one afflicted
with piles."
The prompt relief and rapid cure which
follow the -use of this remedy gave the
impression that possibly it might contain
opium, cocaine or some similar drug, but
a careful and frequent analysis of the
remedy has proven it to contain no in-
jurious drugs whatever, but it cures by
astringent properties and healing oils.
The Pyramid Pile Cure Is sold by drug-
plsts everywhere at 50 cents for full-sized
package.' Â¦ .
Each package conlains a little book on
cause and cure of piles, together -with tes-
timonials from thousands of cured pa-
tients from every part of the United
States and Canada.
The cases that Pyramid Pile Cure do not
reach are so few that physicians are doing
away with operations for piles and depend
more and more upon this simple but safe
and effective remedy to accompllsh-a com-
plete cure and It never disappoints in any
form of piles, whether protruding, Itching
or bleeding.
Will Not Reach.
The Cases That Pyramid Pile Cure

Name Delegates to Attend the
Proceedings in San
Francisco.
The interest of the miners will be cen
tered from now on in the proceedings of
the California Miners* Association. The
Indications are that the gathering will bo
one of the best that has ever taken place
in this State. Secretary Benjamin has
called a meeting of the executive commit
tee of the California Miners' Association,
-which will take place next Tuesday even
in*. At that time the programme of pro
ceedings for the convention will bo ar
ia nged. The California Petroleum Miners'
Association has voted to take part In the
convention. There are also new mining
organizations that will send delegates.
Mariposa, Kern and San Bernardino coun
ties have formed associations of miners.
Boards of Trade and Chambers of Com
merce from several cities, realizing the
importance of the work in hand, have ap
pointed delegates to attend. San Diego.
Sacramento and Fresno have taken such
action. The proceedings will be opened on
the 19th lnat This will be the ninth an
nual session.
The most marked feature of the move
ment of silver during the present year has
been the great increase in the supply sent
from the United" States. Great Britain
imported, in sterling values, Â£9,796,703. and
Â£8.060,107 came from the United States, an
increase for this country of Â£1,434,121 for
the nine months to October 1. This was
an increase of 22.6 per cent and the Amer
ican supply furnished 65.5 of the whole.
he against 67 per cent last year. In nine
months China has taken from London and
San Francisco about 37.450,000 ounces, an
increase of 91.2 per cent. Japan has ap
peared as a silver buyer for tne first time
since the adoption of the gold standard.
The supposition is that it was taken to
pay the Japanese troops in China. The
tnglneeringr and Mining Journal, care
fully reviewing the market conditions,
notes that the total increase in shipments
of silver to the Orient was Â£2,&58,306, or
42.6 per cent, and says:
"The capacity of China and India to ab
sorb silver is not diminishing, and a mar
ket can be found there, in all probability,
for a long time to come. The price of sil
ver has now been at a fairly high level
for some time past. It promises to re
main in that position for the present, cer
tainly as long as the present great de
mand continues."
The price of silver has been higher this
year than In five years past. The London i
Statist is authority for the statement that
India took 60,000,000 ounces of silver in the
year ending â¢ September 1. and predicts
that it will require nearly one-third of the
world's output.
United States Consul McCook reports
that the output of gold has been increas
ing in the Yukon district, but that the
average value of the gravels has been
steadily declining. The cost of working
has fallen and this enables properties to
be developed that would not have been
profitable two or three years ago. Com
binations of traders to keep up prices,
high transportation- rates by land and by
water, unsatisfactory mining regulations,
the charge of ten per cent on the gross
output of any claim where the product
exceeds $3000 per annum, the miner's li
cense, the cost of fuel for thawing the
groundâ these have all worked to make
the operating expenses high.
The American Mining News, published
in New York, alludes to the profits of cer
tain mines under the caption, "Does Min
ing Pay?" as follows:
Strattcn's Independence of Cripple Creek,
Colo.. vis paying quarterly dividends of S4S*..Qno. !
and the total paid has been J2.440.0OO. The Calu
met ana Ilecla copper mines of Michigan have
paid J.0.060.0W to the shareholders, though it
cost them Â«, 200.000 before one dividend was de
clared, and it was started originally as a "wild
cat." The mines of Cripple Creek, Colo., paid
nearly |1. 000.000 net In September, and the to
tal dividends paid by the mines of the district
amount to $13,000,000. During tho month of
August copper to the* value of I4.5OO.00O was
shipped from the United States to Europe. In
the same month American mines paid I3.M6.
154 and for the six preceding months over JI4,
000.000 in dividends. .The Homestake of Lead
| ville. Colo., has produced In twenty-three years
$65,000,000 and has paid nearly $10,000,000 in clean
1 dividends, and the Homestake of South Dakota
has been paying quarterly dividends of *106.C0O
regularly for over a year. These are but a
few figures gathered at random here and there,
but are they not worth considering when com
paring- mining with other industries?
There is an amusing story going the,
rounds that King Leopold of Belgium has
been persuaded to become a mining part
ner of Thomas Walsh of Colorado and
that the King, as a starter, put several
millions of dollars Into Walsh's hands for
investment. This has tne merit at pic
turesqueness if not ot strict originality.
Walsh is thereupon reported to be about
to use the King's money to stir up the
stock market, but more particularly to
invest in mining properties In tho United
States.
The Salt Lake Mining Review is san

New Associations Formed

COUNTIES READY
FOR CONVENTION
OF THE MINERS
. The opinion of State Mineralogist
Cooper, as published in this paper, that
the drilling of deeper wells for petroleum
in California would bring results In find
ing a better quality of oil than has been
discovered in the shallower wells, bids
fair to be tested. Mr. Cooper's expres
sions have been widely copied and have
formed the basis of many editorial opin
ions. His main idea is, as will be re
membered, that the relative thickness of
the oil in the sand that has been ex
ploited ia due to the evaporation of the
volatile substances. Below the upper
sands Is a richer deposit. This has been
the uniform discoverey in all parts of the
world where deep drilling for petroleum
has been performed. There is no reason,
f,rom the geological point of view, why
California oil fields should supply an ex
ception in this regard. On the basis of
this opinion Mr. Cooper said that no field
In California that has been exploited at
all has Aade any near approach to the
period of exhaustion of its liquid wealth.
The report is received that the Junction
Oil' Company has started to drill a well
that w|ll be at least 2000 feet deep. That
is about the average depth of the wells
In the Pennsylvania oil fields. The Junc
tion Company will operate In the Kern
River field. In section 9, 29-28. The com
pany has three- wells that are good pro
ducers. Operators in ail parts' of Cali
fornia will watch the outcome of thedeep
weJl boring with interest. If the theory of
Mr. Cooper shall be determined to be cor
rect, it will open up a vista of wealth be
side which trie present promise is rela
tively small.
Routt County, Colo., is thelatest locality
to have an oil excitement up to date.
The Standard Oil Company is reported to
have alreauy entered me held and to have
secured thousands of acres in the west
ern part of the county. There has been
a rush for some time past. Considerable
development work, is under way. One
well is reported to be down 1000 feet, but
no report is at hand concerning the dis
coveries made or the indications.' Al
ready the boomers are promising that a
railway will be built into Nortawestern
Colorado to tap the oil section. Several
companies, according to one account, are
backed by capital from Colorado Springs.
Eastern capital is al3o going into the
wells.
The Los Angeles Herald estimates that
the monthly output of Ventura County
has reached 50,000 barrels. Hundreds Â«f
thousands of acres have been purchased
or leased for the purpose of prospecting
for petroleum, the greater investments
being in the neighborhod of Plru, Sespe
and Fillmore.
Large contracts for supplying the rail
ways with oil are now the order of the
day. J. M. Keith of Bakersfleld, who Is
largely interested in the Thirty-three Oil
Company, has secured from the South
ern Pacific Company a contract for all the
oil that he can produce at his wells for a
term of five years. The capacity ol
eighteen completed wells is stated by Mr.
Keith to be 1200 barrels per day. His
company will drill additional wells to In
crease the output for the Southern Pa
cific Company's use. The company has
an eight-inch pipe line to the Southern
Pacific spur, which is about one and a
half miles from the wells. A centrifugal
pump is there with sufficient capacity to
load a car every thirty minutes. The ex
pectation is that the output of the welts
in which Mr. Keith is interested will
amount to 2000 barrels per day soon.
Bakersfleld has taken on some of tho
symptoms of a boom town on account of
the rapid development of the oil industry
in Kern County's fields. There are not
accommodations for the crowd, present
and prospective, which will be attracted
by the glittering future of Bakersfield.
A large hotel is planned, rooming houses
are being fitted up and several large
buildinR-s are projected. Contracts for
building all over the town are reported to
have been let. A correspondent write*
from Bakersfleld that the town is making
rapid strides in all sorts of material im
provements. "Something like fifteen miles
of cement sidewalk have been laid; a con
tracting firm is working hard with a big
plant to pave the streets with asphait.
Considering the strain upon the pqeket
books by reason of oil investments Im
provements along modern lines is going
on very rapidly."
To accommodate the crowd that is com
ing into Bakersfleld a large number of
cots, something over a hundred â have
been put into Armory Hall, and there
strangers may. be lodged at the Fate of
$1 per night. :
Of about 500 locomotives owned by the
railways in Roumania more than one-half
are heated with petroleum residuum, pro
jected upon a bed of lignite. Five loco
motives use petroleum exclusively and the
conversion of all the others hts been or
dered. Petroleum fuel is now commonlv
used on the steamers plying: on the Dan
ube. The systematic working of the Rou
mania oil deposits did not begin until
1S59 and there was exported that year
crude petroleum to the value of $30,000.
Slow progress was made until 1895. Sirrc3
then the production has jumped up about
50 per cent annually over the product of
the preceding year. Last - ear 300,000 tons
of petroleum was produced, about one
third of which was consumed in the in
terior of the country. The remainder was
exported.
The Bakersgeld correspondent of the
Los Angeles Times writes:
Efforts to Induce the Southern Pacific to
build a spur from the Kern River branch up
the section 32 canyon, seem to have failed, and
the various companies operating- in that vicin
ity are either becoming: reconciled to a contin
uation of the team hauling process, or are ar
ranging for pipe lines. The Peerless, on the
southwest quarter of 31, 28. 28, is taking: the
lead in this latter alternative, and has pur
chased enough five and five-eighths pipe to con
nect its wells with the railroad, one and &
half miles distant. The plpa will be laid two
feet under ground. The oil -will- be heated by
steam before entering the pipe and the- In
creased fluidity thus gained, together with the
natural advantage of some 200 feet elevation,
will doubtless make the experiment a success.
The subject of transportation is receiving
more attention than formerly. It being manifest
to many that the charge of forty-two cents per
barrel from the fields to San Francisco and of
fifty-one to Los Angeles, is exorbitant. These
rates have set operators to flouring and some
of them have demonstrated to their own satis
faction that the output from the local fields
when it rises to 200 barrels per day, a not un
reasonable expectation, will pay for a railroad
to tidewater v.-lthln two years. The amount
that will be turned Into the railroad's, treasury
durlnjf that time at the above rae of produc
tion rises to J2.C0O.0OO, which sum Includes S3
switching charges exacted for every car. The
foregoing is the substance of an Interview with
one of the operators in the Kern River field.
Ten years ago the oil industry In the
Newhall section was confined to a fevr
wellsâ less than tenâ drilling: west of the
village, all the wells being owned by one
company. The village was small and in
consequent in a commercial way. It has
grown Into a busy little city all on ac
count of the wealth and business brought
by the oil developments. The wells in ihe
vicinity are now numbered by the score.
Ten new wells will soon be ready to
pump, probably this month. The Nfewhall
Held is about twelve miles lonp. The lim
its have never been fully defined in any
direction.
A call is out for a meeting: of the oil
men of the State to be held in the assem
bly room . of the Mills building- next
Wednesday evening. The business In hand
consists of simplifying the methods of
handling oil, to bring about co-operation
among- the several sections of the Stato
to the end 'that' a uniform price for crude
petroleum may be maintained and to dis
cuss the matter of a uniform commission
for stock to be sold through bjjikers and
brokers In the East.

CALL. CALE>*T>An.
NEW TORK. Nov. 10.â To-day's etock mar
ket was not materially changed In character
from that prevailing since Wednesday mom
tn&, except that an opportunity was given to
test it when the bank statement made Its ap
pearance. Considering the kind of buying that
has beÂ«n solng on during thÂ« latter part of
the week and the extent and reasons for some
of the advances made thÂ« market comes
vm Ugl l.M? e test fairly weU - The monetary
cMH which struck the market when the state
ment first appeared teemed to pa*s. but a
ii^ r waa oa the market and fluctuations were
wild and unsettled under the conflicting in
fluence* of vigorous pressure by the bears and
eager support by the powerful bull cliques or
frantic unloading by weak speculative holder*
a w _ ne "' OUB covering for a quick turn by
shorts. ThÂ« earlier market showed very mixed
conditions, but the easer demand for stocks
overrode all other Influences and prevented
much effect on prices from the realizing, which
wae on a heavy scale. Paciflc Mall jumped
nearly 10 points by half-point Intervals on the
announcement of the entry of Union Pacirio
interests into the directory and Union Taclfic
was also notably affected. The steel stocks
showed wide and excited fluctuations on a
; continuance of the heavy speculation in those
; securities. American Hoop, Tin Plate and
I lennessee Coal were most conspicuous and
I were marked up 3 points or over. When the
j market relapsed these stocks and other prom
inent Industrials and specialties were mest af
fected, losing In some cases between two anU
three points, partly recovering before the ciose
The eneculatlve world is so accustomed to
paradoxc* that it was taken Eomewhat by sui
priee to-day by the logical rise of the prlcej
of stocks which followed the ejection. The
wholÂ» of toÂ« speculative life In Wall strett
consists of efforts to anticipate future events
and condition*. Thus a conviction that a larpe
demand Is imminent for 6tocks prompts large
buying and when the event takes place which
has been looked for to causÂ» the demand pro
fessional speculators anther sellers, not only
,1 l 4 lelr holdings, but of short contracts as
well. It is almost Invariably the case that
events are over-dissounted. Hence the prev
alence of the paradox In Wall street: Buy In
a weak market and Bell on good news are
standard maxims there. It Is rarely tne case
that Wall street rails to BUfnciently discount
an event or a condition, especially a condition
that has b*en bo confidently expected as thÂ«
large public demand for stocks which was to
spring up after election, but that Is Just what
happened this week. Wednesday's market
quickly showed the effect of the enormous sell
ing to reailM by the powerful operators who
had been accumulating long stocks for several
weeks in anticipation of the after-election de
mand. Tha concentration of stocks In Â»tronÂ»r
hands, coupled with the frantic eagerness to
buy, made it posslbl* to establish an Impos
ing advance In prices at the outset. Not only
were holders of long stock Induced to realize,
but bear operators almost Immediately began
to put out ehort llnea, confident that the golden
moment of tho culmination of a rlÂ«s had ar
rived. But the torrent of the general deman.l
ewept up all offerings In the market and con
tinued of sufficient force to afford a medium
for continued operations for an advance during
the week, stimulated by all the arts of manipu
lation known to the professional speakers.
The present health of the market aa a result
of the week's movements can only be deter
mined when something more becomes known
of the character of the buying. There haÂ«
been large Investment baying as a matter of
course, coming from Interests acting on posi
tive and accurate) knowledge of the property
whose ehares they sought to possess and whj
had held off from buying from a desire to Â«eo
the issues of the election first positively de
termined.
The larg-s demand for railway bonds afford
a better Index of the, substantial character of
the buying than that for stocks.

WHEAT--Quotatlons from Liverpool and

Chicago opened strong, with some covering
by shorts. The cash demand was good. It was
the opinion that tho market had turned for the
better. The demand has overtaken the supply
of Kansas Wheat, which means a better mar
ket for the Northern article. Conservative es
timates place the Argentine prospects one
third under last year.

CLOSING,
The markets were stagnant to-day, except for
American shares, which were excited, actlvs
and very strong. London apparently has turned
completely around. Having finished selling out
people are now disposed eagerly to buy on any
sort of a tip. Baltimore and Ohio shares, for
example, were largely bought to-day on a mere
rumor that an extra dividend might be de
clared. After the close and while awaiting
the opening in Wall street there was a very
animated curb market on the street
NEW YORK, Nov. 10.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The London Market.
NTSW TORK. Nov. 10.â The. Financier says:
A decrease of $1,344,670 in the reserve of the
New York Associated Banks for tho week end-
Ing November 10 brings the total excess reserve
down to 14,616.060. which In the face of the
enormous dealing? on the Netr York Stock Ex
change adds a new Interest to the Immediate
money market. The statement contains several
surprises, the chief of which Is the loss of
$1,015.;00 In cash. It had been figured that the
banks would show a slight decrease in cash
holdings, but nothing approaching- the total re
ported. There Is every reason to believe, how
ever, that the position of the Clearingr-housa
institutions Is better than indicated In the
statement, for the reason that the gold con
signments from Europe last week do not ap
pt-ar to the full extent In. the averages. The
contraction In loans during the past week Is
very heavy and seems to extend generally
throughout the list of individual banks, not
being conflnea, as Is often the case, to a few
of the larger Institutions. It Is not to bÂ« ex
pected, however, that loans will continue to
contract if the 6tock market business remains
active over the next week. The decrease of
$i0,6S3,400 in deposits Is logical considering the
cr.sh and . loan reduction, and this explains
Â¦why. with J4. 000,000 In canh going out of the
Iisnks. the actual reserve- fell only $1,344,850.
The lessened deposits released about $2,670,000
heretofore locked up under the 25 per cent legal
requirement. With reference to thÂ« outlook
little can be said. The interior market Is at
an end, but a return of funds to this center
is not expected for Boma time to come. ThÂ«
gold Imports have ceased temporarily at least
and for the moment It seems that the banks
will report anything but a plethora of Idle
funds. If this assumption is correct rates will
be held firmly over the remainder of the fall
season, but as Is sometimes the case any a.p
preclable advance here may bring forward
money from other centers. It 1b worthy of
note that the increase in note circulation has
been checked, the banks reporting a decrease
for the first time In months. In any forecast
of the situation it will be well to keep In mind
the circulation Item. The elastlo features of
the new financial law will hereafter be a fac
tor that will influence. the money market.

CHICAGO. Nov. 10.â Moderate activity with
considerable firmness characterized the wheat
market throughout the session save for a mo
ment at the start. With the weather unsettled,
cables firm and Argentine reports claiming 30
per cent damage to the crop of that country
December opened a ] shade higher at 73%c 10
73?ic and soon after touched 73%c. The re
ceipts show continued signs of diminishing, I
and this, coupled with the Argentine advices
presaging a reduction In the exportable surplus
of that territory and a corresponding Increase
for the domestio product, caused covering by
shorts. Cash houses were also good buyers and
brokers had orders to buy for the foreign ac- ;
count. Cash sales were reported at 250.000
bushels. December advanced gradually to 74 W
Â©74%c and closed firm, %c over yesterday,
at 7414c.
Corn was active and In good demand, both
for spot and futures. The feature was the
advance of November Â¦ the first few minutes
of the session, due to the growing scarcity of
old corn and the fact that much of the de
livery Is concentrated In a few hands. De
cember closed %c higher at 35%c.
Oats were quiet, but ruled firm In sym
pathy with wheat and corn. December closed
He higher at 22Hc.
The whole provision list advanced sharply.
Offerings suddenly ceased and shorts were
anxious buyers. Light hog receipts and a
demand from English packers were factors.
January pork closed 17Hc over yesterday, lard
lOignvic higher and ribs 15c improved.
The leading future* ranged as follows:
