on the 26th of October, even the meagre
and contemptible excuse which they now
give for pursuing ti.e plaintiff, namely,
that "Warfleld had not willingly slgn=*X

or not and they did not care, but tr.Â»y had

ter brands General Warfleld - as a pol

Motive Not Traceable..
""Why, then, since they say that they
have' no personal knowledge of any of
these facts, since they say that they have
not bad and have never had any f eellr.s
of ill will against this plaintiff, why have
they not accepted the situation and re
tracted the libel? Because It la not trua
that they are not moved by motives of
malice.
"What is the motive I do not know. We
have been unable to trace the motive: the
motive is just as dark, just as obscure
to-day as would be the motive of an un
known assassin who might come behind
the plaintiff and strike him on the back
of the bead and kill him. showing that
his motive was not robbery by not going
through the pockets of the dead man.
"We do not know what motive moved
him. It was either a motive of malice
acalnst the man' himself, it was some
sentiment of hostility of the cause of
which the plaintiff is unaware, or it was
that general malice against mankind
which is said In the criminal law to
spring from an abandoned and m aligned
heart ready to pare down any man

MAGUIRE OPENS
THE ARGUMENT
Denounces Witnesses Produced

- Perjurers. ,:-/
James G.- Maguire- opened the argument
for the plaintiff at the beginning of the
morning session of the court. He spoke
in part as follows : .
"The action now being, tried Is one of
the most serious character. It Involves
something more than mere property rights
which are commonly submitted to Juries
In trial courts In civil cases; It Involves
a question as serious as is ever submit
ted to courts and juries in criminal cases,
as serious as murder, for the assassina
tion of character by libel is as terrible a
crime as murder itself, and as destructive
to the man who is made the^rlctim of it.
"On the 24th day of October, 1S39. the
plaintiff, a man of good reputation and
standing, retired at peace with the world,
and on the following morning read
lines branding him to the whole State and
the country and to the world as a scoun
drel; a blow delivered to him without
warning, a blow delivered to him by a
man whom he had never harmed nor
wronged, a blow delivered to him either
for the malicious purpose of destroying
him or for the base purpose of making a
sensation and selling a Ubelous newspa
per. ? A* blow such" as that coming without
warning, coming from a man .who had
never avowed enmity, coming as stealth
ily "as the blow of ati assassin delivered
by a footpad from the back In the dark.
was -the startling sensation received by
the plaintiff upon that morning.
"He has appealed to the law for vindi
cation, - having faith In God and faith in
man and faith in the reign of Justice, a
belief in the Justice of courts and the fair
ness and honesty of juries. He has ap
pealed to the law Instead of appealing to
the personal violence which it Is too often
said Is the . only remedy for . such libels.
He has placed his case In the hands of the
court and of the jury, and ho asks for
justice at your, hands to-day.
"Is the libel true? 'Scandal's blight on
the Hotel Rafael.' That is the headline,
and below ft he . accuses the . Baron von
Schroeder : of having destroyed the hotel

he shown attached to the hotej? "Whoever

The argviient presented yesterday for

Baron von 'Schroeder has reached such

Magulre viewed this serious" controversy :
the reputable 'citizen who supplied the
original. Information of Von Schroeder's
debaucheries and attacks upon innocent"
women is "a poltroon, a coward and a
liar." .- -
The men who swore to the facts of de
basing Vice, gross licentiousness and wild
revelries of the Baron are "wandering
waiters, hobo witnesses, perjured, pur- .
chased . tools." ' The attorney did not
know; the \ force < of : ' moderation. Every
man who had^related what he saw of the
shame and scandal of "Baron von Schroe

"Mr. Kruger aver.*? thRt the provisions
of The Hague convention and the law?
and thÂ» us-ages of war are trampled under
foot and he wants to know whether the.
signatories of this convention have any
thing to say on the subject. The man on
horseback at this moment is not Mr.
Kruger, but President Steyn. He, De
larey and Dewet are masters of the situ
ation, having a belter, disciplined and
more effective force than which followed
the vierkleur (Sag) at the outbreak of the
war. ; They have plenty of ammunition
and replenish their stores continually
from the British convoys. They have
taken enough Lee-Metford rifles to arm
all the burghers now in the field."
" The English,' Mr. Kruger said, 'are
waging this war In South Africa like
savages. They arc burning homes, de
stroying farms, cutting trees, devastating
fields and creating famine. They are un
able to capture Dewet, but they are mak
ing prisoners of women and children, who
are not treated with ordinary decency.
Hundreds of women have been confined in
a prison kraal near Port Elizabeth, -with
only one chair, and several of them are
expected to become mothers.'
"First of all nothing is decided about
his visit to America at present. President
Kruger has not abandoned all hope of
securing the support of the governments
of the civilized world In his demand for"
arbitration. Vntil the last government
refuses absolutely to say a word in sup
port of the principles whicji they solemnly
laid down at The Hague conference Mr.
Kruger will not partake in popular dem
onstrations. It Is recognized that if he
cared to do so he could shake the' con
tinent. . The popular enthusiasm for him
iÂ« unparalleled since Garibaldi's visit to
.London, but until his diplomatic mission
is exhausted an appeal to the peoples
cannot even be taken into consideration.
Mr. Kruger is emphatic in disclaiming
any desire to Involve other nations In war
in b"ehalf-of the Boers. "What he asks is
that the governments which at The Hague
declared their determination to use their
efforts to secure amicable settlement of
disputes by means of mediation and ar
bitration should make an united effort to
bring the verdict of the civilized world to
bear on Great Britain.

SECURES DIVORCE FROM
BALL-PLAYER BECKWITH
MANY CHILDREN IN DANGEB
Belief That There Is an Organized
Band of Kidnapers.
MILWAUKEE, Wis.. Dec. 21.â The sen
sational disappearance and return of
young- Edward - Cudahv of Omaha Is
somewhat strangely coincident with the
finding of a letter .In a Milwaukee street
car a few days ago. The letter was ad
dressed to "William Stewart, Chicago, and
told of a plan to rob several residences of
wealthy citizens in Milwaukee and to ab
duct a little girl. The letter was written
with a lead pencil and was signed "Jack."
The letter was turned over to the po
lice, who looked upon It as the work of a
lunatic The day following the finding of
case. The only clew they have' to work
on at present is a copy of the letter
thrown on_Mr. Cudahy's lawn, naming the
hour that the boy would be returned^ The
original copy was - returned -with the
money, this being one of the considera
tions demanded by, the desperadoes. .
Mr. Cudahy this morning confirmed the
offer of a reward of $25,000 for the arrest
of the abductors.
Young Edward to-day stated that the
letter demanding ,a ransom' was hurled
into the yard by his abductors before they
left the neighborhood of his home. That
was Tuesday, December IS. This has
given rise to some curious speculation, for
the copy of the letter was dated December
13 â that is to say,' the following day. It
Â¦was Wednesday morning that the letter
was found in the front yard. If the ban
dits wrote the letter and threw it into the
yard Tuesday night they dated it ahead.
The . letter was unsigned and the state
ment made shortly after its discovery
that it was signed "Jack" was an error.
OMAHA. Dec. 21.â The result of |
twenty-four hours* work on the
part of the police of the city and ;
half a hundred detectives has
brought to light trie location of
the house In which : Edward
Cudahy Jr. was held . a prisoner for
nearly two days, and from which She
was returned to his home in the city at -a
late hour Wednesday night. :
The house is located four miles from the
I city and in a place of easy access, '"but so
; situated as to allow the kidnapers ample
opportunity to lay and carry out their
plans without molestation from inquiring
neighbors. In easy communication with
rail and wagon roads leading in and out
of Omaha and South Omaha, and on a
high knoll where sentries could give im
mediate alarm in case of . necessity, the
one and a half story shack had been ad
mirably chosen by the bandits. No doubt
exists in the minds of the police as to the
identity of the place. Young Cudahy him
self was taken to. the house and identi
fied many features which he had recog
nized while a prisoner.
The testimony of the neighbors also is
of a nature that leads every one to believe
they have found the retreat of the ab
ductors. Evidences show that they made
a hurried departure when their night's
work was completed. â¢' t
It is stated this morning that Pat Crowe,
well known to the local police circles, is
the man whom the police suspect of being*
the leader of the gang who abducted
young Cudahy. Officers In citizens' cloth
ing are looking for Crowe to-day, but bo
far he has not been arrested.
The police detectives who are working
on the matter are inclined to believe that
men not well acquainted with the city and
surrounding country would not have been

he read It on the train coming from Sa
linas the day it was published. On the
day of the publication of that article
when he was returning on the train from
Salinas to San Francisco in perusing the
columns of The Call he discovered that
article for the first time. The first knowl
edge he had ever gained on the subject
was when he read that article in the col
umns of his newspapMV
"Did Mr. Loake receive this information
from a reliable source? Mr. Spreckels'
tells you, Mr. L<eak<5 tells you that they
were both personally acquainted with
General Warfleld for several years; that
he is a man of Manding In the com
munity of San Francisco, holding a very
prominent position in the National Guard
of this State, known throughout the
length and breadth of this State. General
Warfleld. a man of that position and ac
quaintance In the State communicated
these facts to Mr. Leake.
"Was pot Mr. Leake, as manager of
this paper, Justified in taking the state
ment from the lips of such a man? Was
it not a proper thing for him to do, as
manager of a great public journal. In pro
tecting the morals of this State and in de
fense of the reputaiion of the women of
our State, that when such facts were re
lated to him by a man of the prominence
and standing of General Warfleld to be
lieve that he had received, that informa
tion from a sufficiently reliable authority
to give it publication?
"Witnesses Not Impeached.
"I was somewhat astonished at the
statements .of the learned counsel, Judge
Maguire, concerning the witnesses for the
defense. 'Every witness that- took the
stand for the defendant Â¦was a perjurer
and ought to be behind prison bars.' That
la the statement made in effect by counsel
for plaintiff in his argument covering a
little over three hours. Upon what theory
does counsel base such a statement' Upon
what theory does he stand before this
court and this Jury and vilify and brand
as a perjurer and a villain every witness
that took the stand for the defense?
Is there any evidence here impeachinsr
these men? Why, gentlemen, don't you
know that the deposition of the witnesses
Peters. Bailey, Ballard and Moss were
taken during the month of June, 1900 and
that counsel for the plaintiff knew 'what
they would testify to. because he was
set and whether or not we have lived up
to that defense is a matter for you to de
termine, gentlemen, when you retire to
tlje jury-room.
v That we have sustained this defense
there is no question â there can be no dis
pute. We have proved the truth of this
publication and we have justified it com
pletely.
"L'nder the law of this State we are
not obliged to prove the truth of every
word in this alleged libelous publication.
The Supreme Court of this State does not
require that degree of proof from a de
fendant in a case of this nature. The
Supreme Court pays that it is sufficient
If the substance or gist or sting of tho
charge is justified. That we have done
that, gentlemen, that we have justified
absolutely within the meaning of that de
cision, I say there can be no dispute at
this time. Before you can find a verdict
against the defendant In this case It must
be shown that malice, either expressed or
implied, exists. Actual malice, when the
publication is made through motives of
ill will; Implied, when the article pub
lished Is libelous per se.
Absence of Malice.
"Without the proof of that malice the
plaintiff's action fails and he cannot re
cover against* my client here. Have they
shown' that Mr. Spreckels, the defendant
in this case, had any malice against this
plaintiff? Have they shown that at any
time the defendant in this case ever in
any manner or form acted In a malicious
manner toward the plaintiff here? On
the contrary, we have shown here and
we have proved to you that the defendant

suppressed the publication of an article
concerning the plaintiff here. He arose
from his bed at 1 o'clock In the morning
and went down to The Call building In
San Francisco for the purpose of passing
upon that article. D.i you recall that tes
timony? What was done? That article
was 'killed,' to use the language of Mr.
Spreckels â the article was suppressed.
"I want to fay to you further that un

COCHRANE FOR
THE DEFENDANT
Plaintirr Failed to Deny Testi
mony as to His Im
moral Conduct.
James W. Cochrar.e follower! Mr. Ma
/ruire with the opening argument for the
defendant. He said in Dart:
"I ask you to bear with me while. I
bring to your mind what I consider the
most salient points of the evidence in
this case, and at the outset let me 6ay to
you that testimony of a most extraor
dinary and appalling nature has been ad
duced here, testimony which during my
experience practicing betore this bar has
never been heard within the walls of this
courtroom. I want to say to you that in
introducing this testimony Mr. Spreckels
and his counsel have lone so reluctantly,
but the nature of thts action that was
brought against Mr. iSpieckels gave him
and his counsel no other alternative than
to tear the false mask from the face of
this plaintiff that he had been wearing
and bring him. before this court and this
jury in his true Ugat and in his true
nature.
"Knowir.g you, gentlemen of the Jury,
as I have for years, you certainly mu.n
have experienced within your bosoms a
feeling of surprise at The nature of this
testimony and that euch a condition of
things should exist within thi3 commu
nity, within the shadow of your own
homes and your own firesides. A condition
of things, 1 say. gentlemen, appalling la
their nature and in the circumstances
connected with them. And as I view Â»hs
testimony now that is before you and
upon which you are to pass judgment the
pJcJntlff in this case appears before. this
court hy testimony absolutely undisputed
and uncontradicted and put of his own
mouth, a monster in r.um.in form, mas
â¢juerading in society as a titled' gentle
man. That is the way he appears to m~,
pentlemen. Destroying and corrupting
married women *and' injuring and ruining
young girls.
Act of Permanent Good.
"I Eay to you that General Warfleld
and his wife. Mrs. Wai field, aid this com
munity and society at large an act of
Permanent good Â¦when they brought these
facts forward aj-^I that Mr. Spreckels. as
the owner and proprietor of a great pub

it would have been guilty of an act det

repu'.ation of the women of our State. 1
"In the outset, gentlemen, of this caso
we stated to you that our defense was
made up of two parts, the- first of which

"Baron von Schroeder. gentlemen, took

the witnesses for the defense? He sa.
throughout the whole course of this trhl

In their statements. I say that his testi
mony Is an absolute admission of â¢ 'Â¦ Â¦
testimony of the witnesses for. the de
fense. He did not take the stand ana
make any attempt to deny the incident*

say that the lady was not drunk. He sai<l
no glasses were broken except when thÂ«

of keeping a watch for his wife? Did hÂ»
deny that he went into the rear room off
the bar of the clubhouse and sat with a
lady in his lap. his brother also having a

"Did he deny that one night when wine
was being served in one of those back
rooms a single lady, one of thu
party, seized a bottle of champagne an.l
refused to give it up to the rest, saying.
'This is for my boyâ my boy Alex'? DUl

POINTS OF EXCELLENCE.
A Few Seasons Wnich. Are Rapidly
Making a New Catarrh Curo
Famous.
Stnart's Catarrh Tablets, the new Ca-
tarrh cure. ha3 the following advantages
over other catarrh remedies:
First: These tablets contain no cocamp.
morphine or any other injurious drug and
are as safe and beneficial for children as
foradults; this is an important point whÂ»n
It Is recalled that many catarrh remedies
do contain these very objectionable lngreÂ«
dlents.
Next: Belns In tablet form this remcly
does not deteriorate with age. or an ex*
posure to the air as liquid preparations in-
variably do.
Next: The tablet form not only pnÂ»-
eerves the medicinal properties but it is
bo far mere convenient to carry and to
use at any time that it Is only a question
of time when the tablet will entirely su-
persede liquid medicines, as it has alfeady
done In the medical department of tha
United States army.
Next: No secret Is made of the compo-
sition of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets; they
contain the active principle of Eucalyptus
bark, red gum. blood root and Hydraatlr;.
all harmless antiseptics which, however.
are death to catarrhal germs whw?vÂ«r
found, because they eliminate them frota 1
the blood. '
Next: Ton can not care catarrh bv lo-
cal applications to the nose and throat,
because these are simply local symptoms
and such treatment can not possibly reach
the real'seat of catarrhal disease, which
Is the blood; for this reason. Inhalers.
douches, sprays and powders never icu'V-
cure catarrh, but simply give temporary
relief which a dose of plain salt and water
will do Just aÂ» well.
Catarrh must be driven out of the sys-
tem, out of the blood, by an Internal rem-
edy because an Internal remedy la the only
kind which can be assimilated into tha
blood.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets do this better
than the old form of treatment becauÂ«o
they contain every safe specific known to
modern science in the antiseptic treatment
of the disease.
_ Next: Tha use of Inhalers and spraying
apparatuses, Â¦besides being Ineffective and,
disappointing, is expensive, while a com-
plete treatment of Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets can be had at any drug store In tha
United States and Canada for 50 cents.

He said la part: "The true golden rule

"We hear a great deal Just now In con
"demnation and defense of trusts and
combinations. Quite lately a short ar
ticle in opposition to them was sent me
which I was informed was the result of
much thought on the part of an able
thinker. As I glanced on It my eye fell
on a description of a community of peo
ple whose wants were supplied by trades
men and craftsmen who were their neigh
bors. They dealt together -as friends In
terested in* each other's welfare and will
ing to yield something to each other's
circumstance*.
â¢This description was followed by an ar
raignment of combinations and trusts as
destroyers of this happy situation by first
monopolizing certain branches of the
business done ih the communities and
then displacing with their stranger agents
and representatives the dealers and
craftsmen who were their neighbors
and friends. There may be much or litti<s
misfortune in such a cnange. but I cou'>l
not help feeling that the simple, natural,
healthy, live and let live conditions first
described were worth perpetuating."

WASHINGTON', Dec. a.â The commis
sion made up of members of the Senate
and House of Representatives In Congress,
known as the Postal Commission, has
about completed its labors and probably
will make its report to Congress by Janu
ary 10. Numerous charges having -been
made of exorbitant sums charged the
Government for carriage of mails by th<s
railroads and for use of postal cars, eta.
Congress committed to this v Joint Con
gressional commission the duty of mak
ing a thorough investigation of rates
paid railroads for mail transportation.
The Senators on the commission ara
Messrs. Wolcott, Addison, Chandler and
-Martin and the Representatives Loud.
Moody. Catchings and Fleming.
The investi&aUon has been in progress
during the last two years and has Deen
exhaustive in all branches. The commis
sion has visited San Francisco. Chicago.
New York. Buffalo. Detroit and Boston
taking testimony. It is understood that
the commission is unanimous in the view
that the specification of exorbitant rail
road mail carrying charges amounting io
three or four times the fair value have
not been sustained by the testimony. One
of the specifications was that the cost of
railroad carriage to the Government
could be cut twenty-five per cent at once
and that investigation would show that a
reduction of seventy-five per cent could
be made, so that the total annual cost to
the Government would be about $8,000,009
instead of upward of $33,000,000. It is this
specification which. It i= understood, tha
commission is unanimous in not sustain
ing.
Its members are not yet agreed, how
ever, on the question as to whether there
is any overcharge, and this is the chief
point yet to be decided. It Is not yet clear
that the report will be unanimous on all
points. .'. Â¦Â¦!'â¢'-'

According to recent statistics there 1*

Mr. F&rquhar of the commission wanted
to know why it Is that Americas money

tzzzt Americans are buying British caat
cH ships at a targain ar.d are denouncing
the subsidy bill because they will not ben
efit by !t- Mr. Cramp said that the cost
of operating foreign vesseis is less than
that of American ships, a.r:d American
people acquainted with the business can
operate ships if they are given the b*n
Â«et.
"I trn in favor of the subsidv bill." sa'd
Mr. Cramp. "The shipyards in either
America cr England cannot build ships
enough to supply the demand. This being
the case, these vessels being needed, 1
think :f we can build more of our own by
the Introduction of free ships we should
do it. The merchant niarine caiinot be re
habilitated without a subsidy."
Mr. Cramp Eald he thought the subsidy
named in the Hanna bill was "about

Â¦ Mr. Cramp said: "Great Britain's
f ource cf wealth in her shipbuilding is in
the vessels she builds for other countries.
The shipbuilding interests are assisted by
the Government. I wart to compete with
England."
A reason why this country should have
riore ships. Mr. Cramp said, is the stead
ily decreasing coal supply oi Europe, asjcl
eventually all Europe will come to this
country for coal.
Mr. Cramp spoke of the enormous profit
en armor plate. In building warships for
Russia his eonpar.y wa* compelled to pay
the full rate of %S>> a ton to Carnegie for
erraor. This, he said, was one-third the
ccst of the ship.
"If I could cet the prctt on armor

"At Tha: rrtce could armor plate be
f urr.ished to the Government and give the
producer a fair profit? " Inquired Mr. Ken

CLEVELAND'S VIEWS
ON SHIP SUBSIDY BILL
Has Not Changed His Mind Since
Sis Speech at the Launching
of the St. Louis.
PHILADELPHIA, !>ec. 2Lâ A reporter
fcr the North American to-night asked
ex-President Grover Cltveland for his
opinion on the ship suo.*ldy bill now pend
ing In Congress. He dictated the follow
ing statement, which he said contained all
he cared to say regarding the subsidy
measure:
"In regard to this proposed subsidy I
would refer you to iny speech at the
launching of the St. lxmls. I then said
something in favor of free ships. I have
not changed my mind.
"With our much-vauiited accession to a
position among the world powers I hope
io see not so much instead of more of
that sort of coddling which a less promi
nent place In the family of nations was
claimed by some of our people to ex
cuse."

statement in regard to the Democratic
party: *
Richard Olney, Secretary of State
in the Cleveland administration: "I have
read an abstract of the article, but I do
not care to discuss the subject now. I
would prefer to wait until I have read
the article in its entirety before express
ing an opinion, if I have any to express."
J. Sterling Morton: "I fully concur in
the opinions oftMr. Cleveland as to the
causes of the defeat of the Democratic
party In 15*6, and also as to the reasons
for Its bitingly accentuated and vehe
mently emphasized walloping In 1900."
Hilary A. Herbert, who was President
Cleveland's Secretary, of the Navy: "I
Indorse the article heartily, except in so
far as It may be a criticism of the action
of the Democratic party in supporting
Greeley on the liberal Republican plat
form o'f 1S72." Â¦
John Dewltt Warner: "My idea Is that
Democrats can best help the party by
taking every opportunity to work against
the Republican party. I agree with Mr.
Cleveland that it Is not so much the re
organization of the party that is neces
sary as the return to old principles, the
first of which is. I believe, to make a de
cided stand In behalf of the people against
any fresh attempt by the 'syndicate that
exploits McKinley to loot the American
people for its benefit."
Edward M. Sheperd: "I will merely say
that I welcome any utterance of Mr.
Cleveland's; It will do good."

was ejected in 1S77 to ma first public of

being twice re-elected. As" a member Â»>i
the State House of Representatives.' to
which he was # elected In tne years Uvvi,
h^3 and lÂ£84, he lirst uttracted the atten

chosen by a unanimous vote as the Re

After His Return From Europe.
"Yep sir. I pave four drops on a spoon
to Cadet John ('. Pegram and the same to
George F. Ro^elle Jr.**
Cadet Fred I. Deen of Texas, who. ac
cording to a previous witness, gave hot
sauce to Boos, denied that he had don*
so. He said Booz was not forced to take
the sauce. It Is* well known among the
West Pointers that Deen. when a fourth
class man. fonght fifteen rounds with an
upper-class man. and. although defeated,
came out of the fight with glory.
Tc-day the story of the right between
Cadet r'ranK Keiler and Booz in Fort
Putnam en the 6th of August, lsS*. was
told by Keller himself, as â¢well as by
some cf the seconds and the sentinels
who were posted to watch for officers |
who might interfere.
Keller said: "1 was chosen by a com- j
initiee oi my class to 'call out' Cadet [
Bcoz Dtcause he dhobeyea the orders of j
the corporal ct the guard ana made Inao- j
lent ie.i.ctiÂ»v< to an upper class num. I ,
was tola to wtign in. and 1 turned 15J
pounas. Ii.ii was la- pounds. He was
taller than i ana had a longer reach.
"We stnppeu to the waist." continued i ,
the witntss. "My steends told me 1 had ,
a tough customer to mret and they told j
me to do my best. For the first thirty |
seconds after the call of time Boo*
showed a tittle tight, as he struck me a
couple of times about the shoulders. I
stiuek him under th*- left eye. cutting a j
slight gash. .After thi.-Â»'he turned his 1
back and kept running away. I frequently
told him to lace me or 1 wuuld hit him In i
the tack. I uiÂ«l hit him a couple of blows ;
under the right arm. In the second Â§
rovnd I thought he was= going to put up
a tight after ail. but he immediately be- j
gan runninK again. I struck him In the i
right eye and then on the stomach. He
went down altogether, although the- blow
was neither a knockdown nor a. knockout 1
blow. He lay on the ground ami was t
counted out.
"1 went up to him and shook hand?. I I
said I heped he had no 111 feeling toward j
me. Ife said. 'Xo." and smiled."
'"Did you hit any blows In the region of I
the beart" a.skÂ«l General Clous.
"No, sir; I did not."
"When questioned aa to whether he had :
hazed lower class men or given them "hell
sauce." Keller said. "No." but he admit
ted having "bmced" a few.
Cadet Ralph N. Harder of New York,
one of the sentinel* at. the fight, said |
Booz was not hit hart! enough to knock ;
him "down, and that al. through he acted
cowardly. Booz lay on the ground and
cried. Harden acknowledged bavins
taken part in hazing lower class men.
Cadet W. T. Eettlson of Kentucky told
of one occasion when Bocz was on senti
nel duty at the rear of Bettlson's tent
when he spoke to Broz. who was stand
ing at one end cf the post, and told him
to patrol his pos-t properly.
"Had ycu any risht." asked General
Brooke, "to give him any such instruc
tion-??' "Â¦Â»
"No. not officially," replied the witness.
"But I felt I had a rirht to give some in- j
formation to him when he was doing ;
wrong."
"Was it not a breach of military disci- j
p'ine fcr you to speak. Ut a sentry Â«n
duty?"
"It was."
"And. as a re*ult of that. Mr. Booz was
called out to figh*?"
"Y?s. sir."
"Then. sir. you had no rl?ht to rut Ca-
Cvt Bocz in. that position." said General !
Brook;, sharply.
Cadet George R. Spauldlng of Mich!- j
ran. who acted .is tim^Keener at thÂ« fight,
snid TUax was not severely Injured, and j
walked all right from Fort Putnam to j
camp, over thrtÂ»e-qwarters of a mile. Ho |
positively denied ever having hazed Booz. j
Csilet Josep/i Farnsworth Barnes of Ihe |
District of Columbia, who was jne of
Keller's seconds in the fight, gave rather
a new version oi the encounter, as he said
it lasted three round.". He said Booz ran
away from nl3 opponent, and wa3 not
knocked out.
Cadet. Jame3 Prentice of New Tork *a!d
that one day BÂ«k>z caxne Into his te-tt and
asked if I 1 * could- not He dewn. He told
Prentice that he was afraid he had heart
disease, and Prentice advised him to re
sign. Booz also suffered from sore feet,
and the witness gave him powders te. use
on thtm. He saw Booz read his Bible,
and one day saw him reading a small
book which he held inside of his Bible.
I He could not say what kind of a book It
was. Prentice saw Bccx braced one night
in the camp. Booz ?eemed to have a weak
1 back.
â¢ Cadet Edward H. DeAnnond of ilissou
i ri whe acted as a sontinel at the fight,
said he saw it all. and that Booz got a
1 black eye. He never knew Booz to be
leouired to take pepper sauce.
"Did you ever require any one to take
this hot sauce?" asked Goneral Clous.

A child three vears of age died of
drsnkenness the other dar in New York
City. The parents said they had given
the child -whisky to strengthen him.
In their absence he found a bottle of
Â¦whisky and drank frora it, tistil he fell ,
over in a drunken stapor, from which
the physician cxrald not arouse him.
That is only one case in several cases
of baby drunkards recently noted. The
important fact is that alcoholic stimu-
lasta g^ickly develop the alcoholic habit
in children. Thfj fact is just as true
â¢when the alcohol is disguised as a medi-
cine, a *" sarsapariila " or . other Â¦ com-
pound." So many medicines contain
alcohol, to the same extent that it is con-
tained in beer or -whisky, that parents
6hotf.d be cautious what medicines they
give their children.
, There is absolutely no alcohol, whisky
or intoxicant in any form in Dr. Pierce's
Golden Medical Discovery, neither does
it contain opium or any other narcotic
It is a blood-making and body-bailding
medicine. It does not make flabby flesfi
but good, firm flesh aad muscle. It is
pleasant to the taste.

1 The many and divergent acrobatic "re
versal*," as the in and out running of
horses has been termed, have brought dis
may into the camp of turfgoers. True,
horses are not machinery, neither are the
best of riders infallible, so-far as making
mistakes is concerned, but it looks at
present as if this contention was -being
worked to death.
By fome the officials at Oakland are
criticized for being" too harsh and over
zealous In their methods of dealing with
owners and riders. Looking at It the otfjer
way;- what would become of the sport If
owners were permitted to resort to any
ends to get a price, or if the Impetuous
jockey should be given free rein to do as
he fancied? In no other sport are the In
ducements to stray from the path of hon
esty"Â»Â«'o great. Then, why should the rem
edy-not be a severe one?
It is strange that some riders go along
season after season, and the breath of
scandal never attaches to their names,
while others' are continually In hot water.
Where there is so much smoke/ there
must be a speck of flame. No severer
Â¦judge ever presided in the stand than Cap
tain J. H. Rees, and yet that official's
most ardent enemies will, as time rolls by,
admit he makes but few -mistakes.
It Is the object of every racing associa
tion to employ officials in the stand of
known competency, and honesty, and they
should be accorded the respect due them,
when Tommy' Burns transgressed â¢ the
rules at Oakland one day. last 6eason, It
was his Insolence that brought about such
severe disciplining. For the time Tommy
seemed to forget that a. public idol waB
subject. to the fame rules and regulations
as the. veriest novice in-the saddle. He
flatly refuiÂ»ed,.to ride Sly. when ordered to
do so by the stand, and his Jockey-room
window escapade and flight to, the, train
cost him many hundreds , of dollars.
It -was a regrettable occurrence, for
Burns is a rider from the ground 'up,
and the experience -may add to his stock
of discretion.

be furnished, to explain, away, the In and
outrunning of a horse by the animal's

Miners' Strike Ordered.
VANCOUVER. Dec. 21.â The South Wel
lington Miners-" Union has passed a reso
lution to strike because Manager Faulda
refuses to pay for turning places and has
given notice to increase the miner'3 ton
from 2350 pourda to 2S0O pounds. The
union claims that this is contrary to their
agreement made last August with the
mine owners. The strikers allege that
the new regulations are equivalent to a
cut of 43 per cent. They declare that they
will not resume work until their terma
are granted.
THE CALL'S RACING FORM CHART.
Large Field of Riders Will
Follow the Aniseseed Bag
as If It Were a Fox.
The San Mateo Hunt Club will meet at
9:30 this morning at Wellesley Park, Red
wood City. The fine weather after the
rain has rendered the going good, and a
large fibld is expected. Next Wednesday
the pack under the charge of Jerry
Keating, the huntsman, will be laid on at
the kennels, Burllngame, at 8:30 In the
morning. F. J. Carolan. the master of the
San Mateo Hunt, has not yet returned to
Ban Francisco, being detained by busi
ness In the East. It is now expected that
he will reach California about New Year's
day.
The meet last Saturday was at Home
stead Common, between San Mateo and
Belmont, and was quite well attended,
many ladies in carriages watching the
throw-off. Jerry Keating hunted the pack,
and among those who followed were J. J.
Moore, who also had two grooms Â«ut,
John Lawson Duncan Hayne, Peter Mar
tin, E. D. Beylard, A. L. Whitney and W.
B. Tubbs. â A good run was enjoyed over
the hills, the finish being at Poor Farm,
near tha Upper Crystal Springs Lake.
The riders wero well mounted and took
the fences well. I^ext Saturday the last
meet of the year and century will take
place at 2 In the afternoon at Spring
Valley Cottage, Upper Crystal Springs
Lake.
BY far the most Impressive perfor
mance at TajDforan Park yester
day was that of the strapping:
brown colt, Articulate, a son of
St. Andrew, from the Australian
mare Utter, In the event for two-year
olds. It was a nicely conditioned racing
concert, bringing together seven fast
ones, all with weight up. five of which
number had scored brackets at their pre
vious essay. As the track was muddy,
and Articulate had displayed a marked
tendency for this sort of going, he was In
stalled favorite. Of the others, Andrattus,
Seide and Bernota were tho only ones con
ceded a chance. For about half the dis
tance Mounce, on the favorite, indulged
Andrattus and Seide with the front posi
tions. Then Articulate was given his
head, and, taking the lead in a few
strides, won In a great, big gallop. An
drattus tired very badly, losing the place
to Seide by a couple of lengths. Bernota
appeared unable to handle his 115 pounds.
Two outsiders, Lou Rey and Klckumbob,
Infused some life Into the game by'scor
ing at lengthy prices, while favorites cap
tured the other four events.
Sam Hildreth did not pick out a very
soft spot to start Telamon for the first
time. The two-year-old, carrying. ninety
nine pounds, squared off in the 'fifth chap
ter with Lennep. Fred Foster's mare had
O'Connor in the saddle, and she . just
played with the younger horse from the
start. When thÂ»* odds against Telamon
reached 3, there was a rush to get aboard
Tod Sloan falling with the rest of the
Kastern contingent. Autumn, now owned
by "Major" Covington, was the only other
starter.
Unfortunately for the backers of Bam
boulia, one of eleven starters for the first
event, a six-furlong sprint, the bay horse
failed to get away from the post. Glis
sando, the favorite, piloted by Coburn,
then went out, winning, hard ridden, from
Parmcnion.
This was followed by the win of Lou
Rey. a 10 to 1 shot. Ab Stemler's en
try was only liphtly considered for the
mile arid a furlong run, and well handled
by Farrell, came home an easy winner
from Don Luis. Hohenlohe. the first
choice, lost the show to Acrobat, which
was clubbed for half a mile.
McNamara <?id not look best of the
bunch lining up for the mile selling run,
notwithstanding Magrane's horse was
made favorite. Kickumbob always did run
well over a heavy track, with light
weight up. and he downed the favorite
with comparative ease. Osmond ran into
the show. The winner was quoted at odds
of 7 to 1.
Barney Schreiber's mud lark, Boundlee,
made eff with ihe last purse. An even
money chance. Buchanan landed him first,
a couple of lengths before The Singer.
Cyril ran third.

Brown Colt Proves a Wonder in Muddy- Going.
Lou Rey First at Long Odds-
WASHINGTON, Dec. 21. â Senator
Lodge, who had charge of the Hay-
Pauncefote treaty In the Senate, to-day
made the folio wing statement:
Tiie Senate amendments were not dictated!
by hostility toward England and still less were
they in any degree a reflection upon the Sec
retary of State. The amendments were made
by the Senate solely because in its opinion they
Â¦were necessary for the interests of the United
fctates. for the avoidance cf any question as to
the control of the canal, and consequently for
the sake of peaceful and harmonious relations
with the rc-vt of the world on that subject in
the future.
The :irtt amendment is a simple declaration
that the Clayton-Bulwer treaty ceases to ex
ist and is superseded by the Hay-Pauncefote
treaty. The object of the latter was to re
move the forr.ipr as an obstacle to the con
struction of the Isthmian canal. Some good
judses thought that the Hay-Pauncefote treaty
di'l this completely a3 It stood. Others believed
that certain portions of the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty still remained in force. To allow this
doubt to continue would have boen a grave mis
take. The American peop'.e desired to be rid
of the Clayton-Uulwer treaty finally and be
yond question.
Under Article II of the Hay-Pauncefote
treaty as It stood we Trere clearly bound, if
Â«-ngaperi in -war, to permit a hostile fleet, if it
f ucc-cedod in Retting inside the three-mile zone,
to pass unmolested through the canal. This
may or may not be a practical question, and
it Is of no consequence whether it is or not.
It was a soltmn promise to permit a hostile
fleet to use the car.al. That promise we either
Intended to keep or else we made it knowing
thai under the stress of war we should break
it. If we meant to keep it, then it was a prom
ire no nation ought to make. If we knew that
we phouM not kerp it In time of war, then
It was only honest and fair to relieve our-
Bclvea of the obligation In the treaty Itself.
This was the purpose of the second or Davis
amendment, which entirely disposes of any
such promise, and which follows exactly in
principle and almost exactly In words. Article
X cf the Suez convention, which reserved sim
ilar rights to Turkey, whose interest in the
Suez canal is trivial compared to ours In the
proposed Nicaragua.
The third amendment strikes out article III.
by which we engaged to Invite other nations
to adhere to the treaty and thereby become
parties to it. Had there been no Clayton-Bul
v.-er treaty we should have n^protlated with no
<me except O>sta It'.ca and Nicaragua as to
building the canal. With England* owing to
the Claytoti-Bulwer treaty, we were obliged to
treat, but as we expect Kuror>e to keep out of
this hemisphere, it o-emetl to the Senate un
wise, however excellent and liberal the Inten
tion, to Invite European nations tef share in an
American treaty and thus give tliem the right
to meddl" in American affairs at any point.
We desire to dispose of the Clayton-Bulwer
treety in the mort friendly v.-ay possible. W>.
are mo?t averse to any other disposition of it.
England does not Intend to go to war with us
to prevont our building the cansl. and If it is
physically possible to build It we mean In any
ev*-nt to cJo so. l'n>ler these circumstances we
are very clear that it Is as much for England's
interest as for ours to accent the r.ew propo
sition* in the friendly spirit in v.hlrh they are
ottered, and thus end a controversy over a
â¢worn .out treaty which is only a stumbling
blocJc to both nations. It is not to be doubted
that the English Ministers, whose ability, ex
perience and reputation are known to all the
wor!d. v.ill duly u-tleh Â»11 these considerations
and rightly comprehend the . purpose cf the
Senate amendments and the spirit in which
they are presented.
Says They Will Undoubtedly Be. In
terpreted in the Spirit in
Which. They "Were
Presented.

ways and means for bringing before th*
next Legislature the matter of preserving
the redwood forest3 In the Big Basin. Tha
first donation for carrying on the work
was received from Mrs. Phebe Hearst In
the form of a $230 check. She announced
that the sum would be doubled If thÂ©
club would make a special effort to secure
other subscriptions.
A committee of three was appointed to
solicit funds, which will be used in pre

PEKING. Dec. 21.â Once more there is a
pronounced hitch in the proceedings. The
preliminary joint note has not yet been
signed. Mr. Conger, the United States
Minister, sars he does not believe that
there are sufficient reasons why It should
not be signed In the near future, and Sir
ITrnest Satdw, the British Minister, takes
the same view. Dr. Mumm von Schwartz
enstein, speaking for Germany, believes
that the existing agreement will be signed
sooner or later. The other Ministers also
saj* that they consider the probabilities in
favor of signing.-
Chinese sources of information, how
ever, say there is reliable authority for
the statement that there is very uule
chance of the note being signed for some
time. -As a matter of fact, the members
of the staff of Li Hung Chang believe that
the note will eventually have to be drawn
up either in Kurope or America, probably
tne latter, because they claim that the
Washington Government has had most to
do with the existing modifications of the
various forms of harshness.
The United States is looked upon by the
Chinese as the only power really desiring
to retain the integrity of the Chinese em
pire. The other powers are regarded as
desirous of breaking It up, with the pos
sible exception of Russia, which, the Chi
nese think, merely favors a. postponement
in order to eventually secure a larger
share. . â¢ Â¦
Grave fears are felt regarding the health
of Li Hung Chang, owing to a severe com
that he caught on the day he visited Gen
eral Chaffee. It is said that he is better
to-day, but there Is a fear of pleurisy;
which at his age might be fatal.
It is generally believed that. the Chinese
get' their information as to what is done
at the meetings of tne envoys, through
some one connected with the, Russian le
gation. - Â¦ , . . ' - â¢ Â¦ â¢ Â¦ * Â¦
WASHINGTON. Dec: 21.â Mlnfster Con
ger is severely criticized In administration
circles for his conduct of the negotiations
on the protocol which Is to be signed In
Peking to-day or to-morrow. He has
acted throughout In antagonism to ?he
policy of the President and Secretary
Hay, desiring extreme punishment of the
Boxer leaders, although the adoption of
such views would probably have resulted
in the rejection -of the demands, of; the
powers and made a renewal of hostilities
Inevitable. His antagonism has culmin
ated la placing the Lnlted States in the
attitude of insisting that the preamble of
the agreement shall state that the- terms
presented are "irrevocable." and though
this change in the. American attitude has
created surprise, other powers are willing
to accede to n. Mr. Conger bases his ac
tion upon an error made in the transmis
sion of the cipher message' directing him
to accept the British proposition modify
ing the word "irrevocable." but the Qis
position of the Minister to Insist upon ex
treme conditions seems to have been re
sponsible for' his strange interpretation of
these Instructions, especially as they arc
directly opposed to those previously, re
ceived. â¢ â¢â¢ . -Â¦*. â¢ â¢ Â¦ . .
In order to . prevent I further delay, the
President and Secretary Hay deemed it
wise to: accept the. word "irrevocable,"
and after the Cabinet meeting, to-day in
structions were sent to Mr. Conger to
sign the agreement. 'This la reason to be
lieve that Mr. Conger has been informed
of the disapproval cf the President of his
action in urging, the retention of- the word
"irrevocable in- the agreement. There is
no Intention, however, to recall Mr. Con
ger* and he will conduct the coming nego
tiations with the Chinese envoys.
Belief Prevalent That New
Document Will Ee
Drawn Up.
Conger Is Severely Criticized in Ad
ministration Circles for His
Conduct of Peace Nego

Beyond a doubt the Canadians are right
in crediting much of their immunity from
violent crime to the sharp and sure Jut
tice that is always meted out to criminals.
As all criminal laws are made by the Fed
eral Parliament, they are the same In all
provinces. More Important still, there ar-Â»
practically no court delays. There is no
appeal to a second court, nor Is there any
other method by which, proceedings can
be staid and the case dragged throueH
months or years, as In this country. TKÂ»
Minister of Justice for the Dominion alone
has the power to stay proceedings, anil
the cases In which he flnd3 It necessary
to Interfere are exceedingly rare. Con
viction is unwaveringly followed by a
prompt execution of the death penalty.â
CHICAGO TRIBUNE.
But the American trolley is certain to
Invsde London. It may not gnt into tha
inner circle, but It will get ciose enougn
to give the Londoner a livelier stride and
to make him look in fifteen different and
distinct directions at the same time. By
the time he gets bumped a few times anil
acquires the "trolley face" he will booh
realize that he is 10 longer In the Eliza
bethan age. but that he is up against thÂ«
real American expansion movement. ThÂ«
Londoner is a stolid, conservative Indi
vidual not easily moved or excited. But
the American trolley car will move him.
Tbe sight of its glaring headlight in the
dlstar.ee coming at the rate of thirty milea
an hour will soon give him a regular Chi
cago movement. â CHICAGO TIMES

A Policy of Error.
When England gets over thÂ© war fever,
which is now blinding the popular sens*
of right and Justice, we do not believa
that British opinion will tolerate this
despotic system of government In terri
tories where the people have abundantly
proven their capacity for self-govern
ment. The amendment to the addres3
moved by the Liberals "that It would con
duce to the pacification and future good
relations of the races in South Africa if
measures securing the 'liberty and pros
perity of those who surrender bÂ© an
nounced at the earliest possible moment"
points out the enormous and radical
error of the Chamberlain policy la
neglecting to commence such measure*
long ago.â ST. PAUL PIONEER PRESS.
Industrial Migration.
The migration of European capital In
vested in Industrial productiveness from a
continent of exhausted natural resources
is. the most natural thing In the world.
American bridges, agricultural machin
ery, locomotives, steel rails and warship*
have successfully invaded foreign mar
kets, and will continue to do so In In
creasing- ratio, because with our a.bun
dant raw materials and maxvelously effec
tive machinery we can produce thesi
things against the competition of thÂ«
world. "We have been sending coal abroad
to supply European deficiencies, but long
headed British capitalists bavÂ© decided
that It will be economy and the applica
tion of some' business sense to go to thÂ«
American coal and ore and send finished
products into the world's market*.âPHIL

The country nro'ls American ships now.

otherwise there will soon be a glut, oyer-

Joseph Manley, the well-known politician of Maine,
was recently offered*the position of internal revenue
collector with a salary of $6600 a year, but refused to
take it because it would require him to resign his posi

In this connection we may once more. remind those
vho can do their shopping in the day that they should
by all means leave the evenings to the workers. To
day and to-night and on Monday the stores will be
crowded, but there is no reason why all should not
be able to get through the crowds without loss of
temper. Let each one as far as possible make room
for another.
We speak of it as a week,. for after Christmas the
preparations for welcoming the new century will be
gin, and these will be on a scale not less splendid and
gay than those made for Christmas itself. ' We are not
tÂ« have the grand carnivals and festivals devised in
<ome cities to welcome the century, but we will have
a great celebration none the less. â¢
This mighty impulse of trade is an evidence of
something more than Christmas jollity. It is due
largely to the events of the past and to expectations
of the future. Humanity lives not in the present only.
It looks before and after. Our people have had a
year of prosperity, and in the year to come perceive
prpspects of golden harvests. All these things com
bine to augment the merry liberality of the season,
and we shall have a Christmas that will sum up in
iuclt the good of the past and the glow of the future
ia one great week of joy.
BUSY, bright and gay as is San Francisco at

before there was greater activity in the holiday

gladdened tradesmen during the past week. To-day,
whether the weather be fair or stormy, there will be
something of a culmination of what might be called
the annual shopping festival. True, there will be much
business and brisk business on Monday, but that will
be done by the belated ones â by those who have not
been wise .enough to shop early, and therefore it will
be carried on with .1 rush and a scramble^and will
rot measure up to what will take place to-day.
THE HOLIDAY TR0DE.
MEXICO'S SILVER DEFICIT
REPORTS from Mexico announce that heavy ex
ports of silver to the Orient' have occasioned
something like a financial crisis in that country.
i It is stated there is no lack of money in the republic,
but it happens to be in paper or in gold, and the peo
| pie are averse to using it. They have been accus
tomed to silver, and can with difficulty be induced to
: take any other currency.
The situation recalls a somewhat similar condition
I of affairs which prevailed in the Eastern States in 1800.
[ There were loud demands for more paper money, and
! the demand came with special urgency from the rural
! districts. It was found that large numbers of East
ern people were afraid of gold. In some cases it ap
pears business was seriously interfered with by the
\ lack of paper, and our Eastern exchanges at the time
from all parts of the country from Boston to Phila
i delphia were actively engaged in discussing the situ
i ation and suggesting remedies. -
Men . desire to handle money to which they
\ have become accustomed and with whose character
istics they are well acquainted. The average East
i erner is not quite sure that he can tell a gold coin
i from a counterfeit, and therefore hesitates to take
! gold. In California, on the other hand, persons who
! will take gold, almost without looking at it will scru
\ tinize a bank note or a greenback with as much care
\ as if it were a new kind of animal and likely to be
j dangerous. -Â¦<''â¢*;Â»
There is another point in the Mexican situation,
however, of even more interest than the display of
' conservatism with regard to the kinds of money in
j circulation. For some time past the movements of
i silver have attracted the attention of financiers and
eronomists. There has been an enormous demand for
silver in India, and as a consequence the price has
: begun to rise all over the world. The bimetallists
have been prompt to notice the fact and to take ad
1 vantage of it as a means of pressing thtir monetary
theories once more upon the attention of the world.
; It is therefore quite probable we shall hear a good
! deal about the advisability of establishing an "inter
j national bimetallism" before the end of the year.
I Moreton Frewen, an English bimetallism who
' comes very near to being a free silver crank, claims
, that the plan for establishing a gold currency in India
i has, broken down. While the statement is not to b;
accepted as literally true, it appears that in India, as
in Mexico, the people prefer silver to gold simply
j because it is the money to which they have' been ac
! customed. The Indian Government is said to" have
purchased for coinage purposes upward of 30,000,0110
Â¦ounces of silver since February, and Mr. Frewen pre
i diets that ere long the Government will be forced to
! reopen the mints to the free coinage of rupees., ;
1 Such claims will hardly be accepted by any save
j the bimetallists,. who still cling to the hope of a re-
1 1 1val ' of their cause. The intelligence of the world
From the Evening Post.
Our news columns are occupied to pome extent with accounts of the sen
sational trial -of a libel suit brought against a morning contemporary by
one who claims to belong to the nobility of an ancient European monarchy.
This trial has an importance far beyond its significance as a public
scandal relating to a fashionable hotel. In the first instance it is a libel
suit against a newspaper, and In all such suits the question at bar relates to
the measure of right on the part of a Journal to publish scandalous and
libelous matter In the interest of the public In the next Instance the scan
dalous matter charged is against one who. claiming aristocratic lineage,
has married into a family of wealth and social prominence.
Great wealth is sometimes made, the prey of titled adventurers when such
wealth is in the hands of vain people. The possession of wealth, when one
becomes accustomed to.lt, Is far from satisfying all of the vanities which
its possession engenders.
-;Â¦"â¢Â¦:'â¢â¢ .j;;Â»'^
"Within the past few years, however, titled distinction hÂ»s been sought by
the purchase, in the way of marriage settlements, of representatives of
what is termed foreign nobility. The titled aristocrats who eeek wealthy
alliances in America are. as a rule, of dissolute habit. They are bankrupt
in everything except an aristocratic lineage. They, are titled paupers. Im
poverished in purse and character, possessing nothing merchantable except
the feminine form of a title which a marriage alliance with them confers.
Physically, mentally and morally, this effete overflow of European aris
tocracy Is undesirable. Â¦ y-'^:. ;; ;f ;Â£
There are honorable exceptions to this title worship, and occasionally
there is a member of the European aristocracy who seeks a wealthy alliance
in America, and Is at the same time almost if not quite a gentleman; but
there is a general and somewhat continuous sameness In the personal "char
acter Of these people and an equally continuous sameness in the character
of the people with whom they form marriage alliances In this country.
"Worthlessness of character on the one side and ignorant vanity on the other
are the salient features of personality in these marriages.

Before its laceration the treaty was plain and com
prehensible.' Now it is confusing and subject to a
variety of constructions, which will probably cause
grave trouble in the future. , f P
It will be seen, therefore, that the treaty provides
that warships of all belligerents, including ours and a
nation with which we may be at war, shall pass
through the canal, and that we shall, under the Davis
amendment, treat it as part of our military frontier,
and that, though so treated, it shall enjoy immunity
from attack by a belligerent, and though usable by
Ua in defense it shall not be fortified.
Now, either the Davis amendment annuls the pro
vision against fortification, or is annulled by it.
Section 6 immediately follows, declaring that the
canal and all that is. necessary to its operation shall
enjoy in peace and war complete immunity from at
tack and impairment. ' ,
The next section provides .that no fortifications
shall be erected commanding the canal or adjacent
waters.
Then follows the Davis amendment, which reads:
"It is agreed, however, that none of the foregoing
conditions and stipulations, in sections!, 2, 3, 4 and 5
of this act. shall apply to measures which the United
States may find it necessary to take for securing by
its own forces the defense of the United States an1
the maintenance of public order."
The so-called Davis amendment will probably cause
great confusion in the future interpretation of the
treaty.
In the first article it is provided that the United
States may build and regulate the use of the canal.
The second article opens the canal to the world, pro
vides against its blockade, regulates the passage
through it of war vessels, fixes conditions for the
ships of belligerents and their conduct in the neutral
waters at either end.
THE full text of the Hay-Paunccfote treaty, as
ratified by the Senate, has been given to our
readers.
THE NEW TREATY.
It would be gratifying to have an equally prompt ac
tion this winter. The country is hardly ready yet to
deal definitely with the Southern problem. Moreover,
when that problem is ripe for solution it should be
uken up at a long session, when ample time will be
piven for debate, and when the success of other great
measures will not be imperiled by it. During this
session the country expects of Congress a Nicaragua
canal bill, a merchant marine bill, a Pacific cable bill,
an army bill, a re\-ision of the wax revenue bill, a
postal reform bill and an immigration restriction bill,
ir addition to the bills providing for the current ex
penditures of the Government. It would be an un
wise policy, therefore, to precipitate at this juncture
the prolongc'j fight which a strong effort to pass the
Crumpacker bill would certainly entail.
There is an excellent precedent for speedy action on
the apportionment bill. It was established by the
Fifty-second Congress in dealing with the question
after the census of 1890. In that case the report of
the population was submitted to Congress immediately
upon its meeting, and early in the session an appor
tionment bill was reported. The debate upon it lasted
but a single day. The bill was passed by the House
on December 17. The intec^ntion of the holiday
recess prevented immediate action by the Senate, but
on January 29 it was adopted by that body. The
President approved and signed the bill on February
7, and ample time was thus piven to State Legislatures
in session that winter to redistrict their States.
The question of representation from the States whera
tht negro vote has been restricted affords opportu
nity for prolonged debate, but it is doubtful if it will
occur. There is much work to be done at this session,
and the Republican leaders have no desire to waste
time in fighting for a measure which, if carried through
the House, would probably be defeated in the Senate
by the exercise of dilatory tactics until the term of
this Congress expires. Moreover, the question of the
constitutionality of the restriction acts in 6everal of
the Southern States is yet to be passed upon by ihz
Supreme Court, and it is believed it would be bet
ter for Congress to leave the issue alone until the
court has spoken.
rROM the House Committee on the Census
there have been reported three apportionment
bills fixing the membership of the House for the
next decade. The majority reports in favor of the
Hopkins bill, placing the number of Representatives
at 357. A minority of six members supports a bill
drawn by Burieigh of Maine, fixing the number at
586, and Mr. Crumpacker of Indiana, in addition to
sijning the minority report, presents a bill of his own
designed to reduce representation from several of the
Southern States in proportion to the extent to which
they have restricted suffrage.
APPORTIONMENT BILLS.
A plan of that kind might not work well in Califor
nia, for in this State the complaint has been not so
much of the cost of the books as of their quality; but
none the less anything which tends to economy is of
value here as well as elsewhere. School-children do
not need books as a permanent investment, therefore
if renting is cheaper than owning, why not try it?
In describing the system a Mississippi correspon
dent of the Constitution says: "The Greenville board
supplies not only the books, but all other supplies re
quired in school work. The rent was determined by
carefully computing the cost of the supplies, the prob
able life of the books in the different grades, etc.
Books in the first and second grades are not expected
to last more than a year, but in the higher grades they
will last from two to five years. The first grade pupils
pay only $1 per*year for everything they use, and the
high school grades pay from $2 50 to $3 50 per year.
The teachers instill in the minds of the pupils the ne
cessity of neatness with their books, which is valuable
in their future career, and there is not a school in
Mississippi that is being conducted on a basis more
satisfactory or successful than the public schools of
Greenville."
Such being the case it is worth noting that one
American community has devised a plan which has
given general satisfaction in dealing with the ques
tion. Greenville, Miss., is the lucky place, and we
learn from the Atlanta Constitution that so well
pleased are the people with the system an effort is
to be made to have it adopted everywhere through
out the State. The plan consists in the purchase of
text books by the School Board and renting them to
pupils at fixed prices. . It is said, the saving to the
parents t in Greenville last year was about $4000, and
it is estimated that if the system be applied with
equal efficiency throughout the State the saving would
amount annually to upward of $150,000.
A SCHOOL BOOK EXPERIMENT.
Q LMOST every State in the Union has a school
/ \ book problem to perplex educators and ex
* * asperate parents. We have one in California,
but the discussion upon it has been mild in compari
son with the uproar and the clamor that goes on. in
some States. There are commonwealths where an
assembly of teachers rarely goes by without the adop
tion of resolutions denouncing the text books or the
system by which they are selected as an "outrage, a
barbarism and a disgrace to civilization." '

facts:
"Never since Colonel Cincinnati got a

"As the party approached their carriage
Mayor Fleischmann stepped forward and

which tickled the members of the Duck

"The Friendly Sons cf 9L Patrick then

Despite all that may be said, there is nothing in the
recent increase in the demand for silver and the con
sequent rise in price to justify a reopening of the old
issue, and if the Mexican Government be wise it will

introduce the gold standard in that country. '.â¢ Â£3'**
will see no reason why a demand for silver as a cir
culating" medium' should indue? the' Indian Govern
ment to set aside the gold standard. They may coin
silver in India as we coin it in this country for use
where gold is too valuable and bank notes are un
available, but they are not at all likely to return to
the old system which in times past was so injurious
to every interest of India and her people.:- 1
We are of orinion that this method would at once

the same time would be a solemn admonition and

He has been compelled to tell of their quarrels and
fights, and made to beast of his skill in dodging do
mestic crockery and glassware aimed at him in many
an inter-conjugal battle. His scars have been ex
hibited and commented on, and the pains and pleas
ures of domesticity have been treated as choses in
action by the lady lawyer, who appears at once as
wife, defendant, attorney and inquisitor.
In this trial the husband sues for divorce and the
wife appears in court as her own attorney. She has
occupied two days and threatens to use two more in
heckling her husband in cross-examination as a wit
ness for himself. It is true that she has made the
rules of evidence look sick and the spirit of Grecnleaf
to groan in great torment, but she has infused into
judicial proceedings an interesting and, at times,
amusing novelty, that will be long remembered. She
has made the somewhat seasoned partner of her con
jugal experience go over the soft and salad days ana
nights of the courtship, and tell in cold blood the
thrills and raptures of his first hours of love. Every
cooing and each billing has been served up in style,
brochctted on the iron skewer of the law.
Perhaps to California will belong the discovery of
a plan to reduce the number of divorces. A divorce
should have publicity. There should be nothing se
cret nor covert about it But publicity alone has not
proved sufficiently deterrent to those "who chafe in
the matrimonial harness. Something more is re
quired. Has it not been found, or suggested, in a
trial now proceeding in this city?
Happily, that law is repealed. Not only social cus
tom and propriety, but the rights of third parties, re
quire that marriage shall be a public contract, not
necessarily entered into in the presence of a great
cloud of witnesses, but made the subject of public rec
ord, through the issue of a license, and the proper
return made and recorded by the officiating party.
THE LAW AND THE LADY.
THE prevalence of divorce in this country has
been much discussed. Regarded by some as a
symptom of abnormal social conditions, it has
been held to foretell the ruin of the social fabric.
The laws of many States have at times been so framed
as to facilitate divorce. For a long time Connecticut
had an evil fame in that respect The laws of that
State increased the grounds upon which separation
could be obtained, and also lowered the residence,
qualification for a standing in court to invite parties
from other States to make it the Mecca of couples
tuffering from marital infelicity.
In that time was written the punning epigram:
For cutting all connections famed,
Connect-I-cut la fitly named.
More recently South Dakota has offered the mo6t
liberal terms and has secured the trade of large num
bers of mismated couples, upon whom the bonds of
matrimony were too heavy to be borne.
California is not specially liberal in that direction,
and our laws have not been framed willfully to make
divorce easy, but still much of the time of our courts
i3 taken up with the infelicities that have followed
the last Quarter of the honeymoon.
Perhaps the apparently undue prevalence of divorce
here has been due to our former contract marriage
law, which made matrimony as easy as a summer

Accident to an Automobile.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 21.â The first se
rious accident to an automobile carriage
occurred here this afternoon whenj. M.
McLeod attempted to force one of the
machines to climb the Eecond-street hill
from Olive street to Grand avenue. Mc-
Leod's machine is a surrey, which he has
been using as a public conveyance.- To
day, with two male passengers, he es
sayed the ascent of the steep grade. The
power gave out and the machine began to
back rapidly down hill. In front of the
Hotel Argyle the automobile dashed Into
the curb, throwing j out the occupants.
The three men escaped with a few
scratches and bruises, but the automobile
was wrecked.
VANCOUVER. Dec, 21.â The bodies of
three victims of the steamer Alpha dis
aster were lost to-day while being con
veyed to the scene of the Inquest Nine
men met death in the wreck and only
three, bodies were recovered. They were
those of J. H. Barber, purser, brother of
the managing owner of the steamer,
Third Engineer William Moore and a
stowaway named McKay. The. bodies
were being taken In a rowboat to Den
man Island. The boat was in tow of a
launch. As it was nearing the wharf the
engines of the launch were reversed and
the boats collided, with the result that
the smaller overturned and the bojies
sank.
James Young was the plucky sailor who
took the first rope from the Alpha to the
shore, and this saved twenty-live mem
bers of the crew. He says Captain Yorke
evidently became bewildered, for he gave
many contrary orders that kept the ves
sel dodging from port to starboard before
she struck. Young: rested on the anchor
until a receding wave laid bare the rocks.
Then, swinging himself outward, he drop
ped upon the rocks, made a dash for the
cliff and even the white bundle of rope
he carried was lost In the darkness. Im
mediately there followed a huge wave
and the suspense on board was terrible.
Then above the shrill distress shrieks of
the steamer's whistle, the roar of the sea
and the howling wind a faint cry came
through the darkness in the direction of
the reef.
Ernest Gough was the first seaman to
cross the line and he found that Young
was unable to fasten the rope against the
rocks, had been overcome by his strug
gles to reach shore and was exhausted.
With one hand bracing himself against
the bare rock and the rope wrapped
around his other arm Gough held up the
line alone for the next half-dozen men to
come up. He was frequently knocked
against the rocks and lifted bodily off his
feet, but he held to the rope until Kls
arm was frightfully lacerated. The cap
tain was halfway across* the line, when
he turned back In despair and later per
ished.

primarily was the heavy and Incessant

VANCOUVER. Dec. 21. âThe valley
lands of the Fraser River, the most fertile

serious that a number, of cattle have been

h&ve happened to Harry Corson ClarkÂ©
since his arrival in this city yesterday

T. McKlslck to make a retraction of cer
tain remarks attributed to him concerning
McKislck's sister, Madeleine Brtiguiere,

pany. Clarke played to a profitless house
last night and his troubles culminated
this morning when he was about to leave
for Marys**ille. Fifteen large trunks con
taining the stage apparel of his company
had no sooner been piled in a heap at the
depot than Deputy Sheriff Hinters ap
t eared and levied an attachment on them
in pursuance of a suit brought In a Jus
tice's court in San Francisco by W. H.
W right against Clarke for $399 W.
The complaint alleged that Clarke em
ployed Wright as his manager at $50 a
week, and the contract provided that
â¢whenever Clarice should discharge him hÂ©
would have to buy him a return ticket to
New York. Wright alleged that he had
nevered connection* with Clarke In San
Francisco, but got no ticket to New York.
He therefore sued for the price of one
and for $200 damages.
Both parties employed lawyers and
there was a deal of wrangling until
Clarke saw that he was about to miss tha
train for Marysvllle, when he compro
mised for something less than $150.

*-In the last act of the play Faust as
well as Marguerite reach heaven: <;Â«J in
his mercy forgives them and they go to
eternal reM. The world condemned them,
but God is king, and lovins. and overlook
ed their sins and showed them that he
was a merciful Creator. That is what we
Fhould do. We should look to God as a
human master; when in trouble we should.
look up to him for protection."
He Says Parts of the Opera Are Strik
ing: Examples of God's Love.
"A great lesson can be learned from the
plot of Goethe's 'Faust.' " said Rabbi
JCieto at the regular Friday evening ser
vice at the Temple Sherith Israel la.<t
Tiigrht. "Poets have tried to give us the
ber.erit of their thoughts, presenting pic
tures so true to life that we think we have
tmendv seen them, while the fact Is that
we have acted those very scenes our
pclves. When Goethe wrote 'Faust' he did
rot do so to please the palates of the au
diences. He wanted everybody to take a
lesson. Tho play is certainly full of noble
and great thoughts. When the curtain
goes down we feel a distaste for the hero
and pity srsd charity for the heroine an<i
the victim of the tale. The play in the
opening is to a certain extent like the
opening chapters of the book of Job. Job,
thougii painted as a patient man, was not
oup. and anybody that thinks that he was
is under a wrong impression. Faust was
jot an ordinary man: he waÂ« a deep Ftu
<Jent and a clever doctor, lie spent all his
life trying to fathom the unknown, and
vet at the end of his life he a-dmitted that
iie knew nothing. Step by step Faust
committed wrong, and Marguerite, know
ing that she also had sinned, tried in
evt-ry **y by prayer to make amends for
her deed
NIETO LECTiJEES ON FAUST
The California Camera Club gave a most
interesting entertainment in Metropolitan
Temple last night. " The members of the
club secured the services of Frank A.
Coxhead. who gave a most interesting lec
ture on Maoriland, New Zealand. The lec
ture throughout was profusely illustrated
with stercopticon views, which evoked
great applause. During an intermission
Miss Lillian M. Qulnn recited several
character sketches, which were warmly
applauded.

The Health Board met last night and
adopted a resolution abolishing the posi
tion of Sewer Inspector held by J. J. Con
nolly. The board decided to do away with
one Food Inspector and one Sanitary In
spector from January 1, 1301. Lots will be
drawn, so that one inspector in each de
partment will be laid off for one month
at a time. This action was taken because
the board is confronted with a deficit and
this can effect a saving of $1650 for the
next six months. Dr. Buckley presented a
set of rules for the government of the
City and County Hospital, which will be
adopted after they have been considered
at a special meeting.
Health Board Reduces Force.
The committee appointed- is as follows:
Messrs. McGilvray, J. A. Wilson and Â¦ F.
H. Masow. Â¦
Contractor Wilson said that it was not
a compromise that was wanted, but an
adjustment of the dlfllculty.
D. H. Bibb of the Bibb Lumber Com
pany said that his firm proposed to run
its business in its own way and would
not be dictated to by the labor unions
or any other body. - He claimed that it
was impossible for the mills to run eight
hours a day and be successful, as thw
had. to compete with the mills north of
the State, which ran ten and twelve hours
a day. - The .mill. owners have hundreds
of thousands of dollars Invested and
could not possibly compete with the north
ern mills outside of California. "I am In
favor," said Bibb, "of a fight to the end "
The views of Mr. Bibb did not find sup
port with the contractors present and he
was interrupted by. loud calls for- thÂ»
"question." . â¢â¢-.Â¦â¢Â¦-. â¢ ."
By a majority vote the' substitute of
McGilvray was carried and Chairman
Kent appointed the. committee to formu
late plans for organization of an inde
pendent body; also to confer with the
labor unions as to the strike among the
mlllmen and to report back to the meet
ing,- which adjourned until next Friday
afternoon at half-past 1 o'clock.
Kelleher waa Interrupted by loud cries
of "Question," but be insisted on his
right to continue speaking.
'"I know that you don't like this ques
tion." he said, emphasizing the last word
"and you know you want to compromise.
Some of you think that it is a crime for
a workman to ask for a day of eight
hours, but the Government and many
States thought otherwise." ' '
Contractor Kelleher denounced McGil
vray for his attack en certain of the
union leaders and said that nothing was
to be gained by abuse.
"If you had acted in a manly spirit
three months j ago." said the speaker
you would not be forced to compromise
at this time."
Contractor McGilvray made a stirrlnr
speech in which he thought that the ilr.u
thing to do was to organize. He depre
cated the idea of a committee of an un
organized body meeting the labor unions
which were fully equipped. Mr. McGil
vray made an attack m certain men iden
tified with the labor unions and designar
ed them as "pothouse politicians." Ho
cited the example of Chicago, where
business was stagnant, due to the "cap
tains of industry" being run by the "rank
and file." The speaker moved a substi
tute to the previous amendments that a
committee of three be appointed to for
mulate plans of organization.- to confer
with all interested parties as to the mill
strike and to report back to the meeting
in a week.
James A. Wilson thought that a new or
ganization was needed. He was in favor
of the eight-hour limit for a day's work,
but thought that all disputes between em
ployers and their employes should be set
tled without the; Interference of outside
parties. He cited an Instance of the ac
tion of the labor unions in calling his men
off from work because they were laying
bricks on a building, the owner of which
had formerly employed non-union mu
sicians in the place.
"I don't want a member of the milk
men's union or the musicians' union com"
to nie and tell me how to do my work
If I have any trouble with my men I can
settle it. The contractors are unable to
do any business if a sub-contractor buys
any material from a nine-hour mill and
thia state of affairs is most unjust. We
must end this trouble for the interests of
all parties."
Contractor C Chisholm favored the ap
pointment of a committee to consist of
one member of each branch of the build
ing trades and was opposed to the organi
zation of a new body.
Mr. Kent then suggested that the meet
ing appoint a committee to draft plans of
organization and at the same time to con
fer with the Building Trades Council.
Supervisor Dwyer moved that a com
mittee of five be appointed.
Mr. Kent stated that the object of the
meeting was 'to make some effort to end
the strike among the mill workers and to
form a protective employers' association
to that end. Mr. Kent said that he was
in favor of the eight-hour movement on
general principles. "The ultimate basts
of a day's work." said Mr. Kent, "will be
eight hours, and the sooner we adopt that
standard the better it will be for all."
With the hope of putting an end to the
present strike among the mill workers
nnd avoiding any possible, friction In
building circles, a special meeting was
held yesterday afternoon in the Builders'
Exchange by more than 109 contractors

DESIRE TO END
MILLMEN' S STRIKE
Court Justice of the Foresters of Amer
ica gave the children of members an op
portunity to see a Forester Santa Claus
In the Social Hall of the Alcazar building
last night. Santa Claus found that he had
undertaken a larger contract than he had
bargained for. After he had given away
a flour barrel full of books, toys and
games he was still besieged by half a.
hundred youngsters who wanted to be re
membered. The many adults present after
the distribution danced till midnight.
Alta Parlor of the Native Daughters had
Its Christmas tree in the banquet hall of
the Native Sons' building, which was tilled
with the friends of members and a goodly
number of children eager to receive some
thing from the hands of Santa Claus,
Hundreds of little ones were made happy
with gifts of candies and toys, and the
adults were given an opportunity to
dance.
La Estrella Parlor, X. D. G. W* had Its
Christmas-tree festival in the Shasta Hall
of the Native Sons' building last night,
and there were hundreds of children pres
ent to see Santa Claus distribute presents
to the little ones. The tree, an Immense
one. was loaded down with many toys
that delight the little ones, and it was re
splendent with large electric lights of all
colors, producing a most striking effect.
Many beautiful articles vrere given to
adults, after which there was an hour of
songs and dances.

WITHIN the near future Sin
Francis~o will receive a visit
from C. AV. I^eadbeator of
London, one of the greatest
apostles of theopophy. who
will deliver two lectures in Odil Fel
lows' Hall. He is expected to ar
rive here in less than three weeks. In
February H. S. Olcott. the founder of the
thoosophy movement, will a'so pay Cali
fornia a visit. Mr. Olcott, though an
American by birth, has made his residence
for the past few years in Madras, India.
He left there recently with the intention
of lecturing in the cause of theosophy
throughout the Vnited States. Both of the
prospective visitors are deep students and
Judgment was given in favor of the
widow and an appeal was promptly taken
to the Supreme Court. Yesterday the
court handed down its decision, in which
it held that a body is not property suscep
tible of disposal bv will and must be
buried by next of kin. â¢
It appears that in 1888 John S. Enos
went to work for Mrs. Rachel Jane Sny
der. He looked after her property inter
ests and made himself generally useful.
Some years after entering Mrs. Snyder's
employ he had & disagreement with his
wife and he left her and never returned
in his lifttine. He continued in the em
ploy of Mrs. Snyder and lived at her
house.
That there was a great deal of ill feel-
Ins between husband and wife was evi
denced in the former's will. He died on
March SO, 1SSS, and one of the provisions
of the document was that Mrs. Snyder
should arrange for his burial and under
no circumstances should his wife or fam
ily have anything: whatever to do with it.
Upon his death the wife demanded the
body, bul met with a prompt refusal. Two
days later Mrr. Susie T. Enos and her
daughter. Mips Gertrude Willis, filed suit
against Mrs. Snyder for possession of the
body.< The case proved to be a sensation
and the population of Sonoma County
was evenly divided in opinion and the
outcome of the suit was watched with in
tense Interest. The Superior Court or
dered the body to be placed in a vault
pending the hearinp of the case, and it
has remained in the sepulcher to this
day.
The ruling was made in a singular case.
After a leRal battle of two years' dura
tion, a widow is given leave to inter the
body of her husband,.despite the fact that
hewllle^ differently, and within a few
days the body of- John S. Knos, a pioneer
of Sonoma County, will lie taken out of a
vault and interred in the family plat. .

The services opened with a voluntary on

rapt attention to the rendition by the
choir of thÂ«- festival j>sa!ms and the chant-
Ing by the cantor or the ancient melody.
"'Kock of Apes, Let Our Song J'raine Thy
Savir.g Power." which from time imme
morial ha? been a feature of the feast of
the dt-aicatlon nt ;he altar.
Itahbl Voorsanper briefly addressed the
crjierepation and said that tic wished 10
re-echo the words heard during the ser
vice: "Bletsed be almighty God. who ha.?
remitted us to live and celebrate this
year." Rabbi Voorsanger earnestly hoped
that thÂ« spirit cf the festival would entter

returning thanks lo the Creator.
Rabbi Wis-e of Portland. Or., was then

Pacific Hail Will Run Steamers to
Central American Ports for
* \ Coffee Trade.
R. P. Schwerin. general manager of the
Pacific Mail, arrived from the East late
yesterday afternoon, and. after a brief
visit to his office, went direct to his home
in San Mateo.
Mr. Schwerin has been in New
looking after the interests of the Pacific
Mail in its controversy with the Panama
railroad. The Panama company has al
ready begun running a steamship line ot
its own between here and Panama, and
It Is now the purpose of the Pacific Mail
to give the Panama people a race for their
money: In other words, the liveliest kind
of competition is to be Instituted.
The Pacific Mail will send its steamers
to Central American ports to take on all
the coffee they can. The coffee will be
taken direct to- <Juaytnas and thence
shipped East via the Sonora and Sunset
routes.
As the Panama company has heretofore
handled a large percentage of the coffee
shipments, the outcome of the Pacillc
Mail's attempt to get the business will be
watched with considerable Interest.

The work of these writers cannot be
classified fully. It contafns humor thai
rings true wherever It is read and yet
which Is characteristically and persist
ently American.
FRED LKWIS PATTEE.
Pennsylvania State College.
Irving was as true a humorist as ever
used the English lansruage, and Holmes
and Lowell, Artemus Ward and Mark
Twain may be placed to advantage by th>*
side of any of the great English wits and
humorists of the century, either In Eng
land or elsewhere. Besides these, America
has produced many minor humorists o!
the truest type â Harte, Leland. Hale. Mrs.
Stowe. Stockton, Cable. Bunner. Warner.
Trowbrldge and many another.
No buffoonery, no trick of twisting of
words and sentencesâ grotesque spellings,
picturesque dialect effects, exaggerations,
Hibernianisms. satires on fine writing anJ
sentimentâ nothing 1 has been overlooked
by the American humorists. "Aluch of
their work does not rise to the dignity
of literature; It Is often merely comic,
like the work of the English Theodore
Hook and Joseph Miller. Yet besides these
merely ludicrous jestezs there 13 a nobla
school of true Ajnerican wits and humor
ists. Franklin shone in London as a w.t
in' the days of Sheridan, Garrick. Fox and
Goldsmith. His bon mots were the ta:k
of the day and were eagerly "copied by tiiÂ»
press. For instance, a young lady of the
name of Gunp once Insisted at an even
ing party that the doctor make an im
promptu verse with her as the subject.
Instantly Franklin ruade the following
couplet:
Cupid now, to insure his fun.
Quits his bow and takes to Gunn.
"I guess if you were at our factories at
Lowell we'd show you a wonderâ 500 gaia
at work together, all in silence. I don":
think our great country has such a real,
natural curiosity as that â I expect th â¢
world don't contain the beat of it â for a
woman's tongue goes so slick of Itself,
without water power or steam, and move.-'
so easy on, its hinges that It Is no easy
matter to put a spring stop on It, I tell
you. It comÂ«3 as natural as drinking
mint julep."
"Society is something like a barrel of
pork; the meat that's at the top is some
times not as good as that that's a llttto
grain lower down: the upper and lowÂ«?r
ends are plaguy apt to have a little tain:
In 'em. but the middle is always good."
"It's better never to wipe a child's nose
at all, I guess, than to wring it off."
"A long face is plaguy apt to cover a
long conscienceâ that's a fact."
"When a feller Is too lazy to work hs
paints his name over his door and calls it
a tavern, and as like, as not he makes the
whole neighborhood as lazy as himself."
Judge Haliburton, who began hia Sam
Slick series in 1S35. is full of homely Yan
kee wisdom. His Clockmaker is often
really humorous.
"There isn't enough bad luck In tho
world altogether to ruin one real, live
man." â Uncle Esek. "If you want to get
there quick, go slow." â Josh Billings. "A
mugwump Is a person educated beyond
his intellect."â Porter. "De runnin' vip.i*
In de grass kin fling you hard'n de stump
In de open road." â Macon. "A reasonable
number of fleas is good for a dog; it keeps
him from brooding on being a dog." â
David Harum.
One may quote almost at random
Holmes was full of sparkling epigram*
"Put not your trust in money, but put
your money In tru3t." "He who is car
ried by horses must deal with rogue*. "
Mark Twain abounds in homely wisdbm:
"It is better to be a young June bug than
an old bird of paradise." "Be good and
you will be lonesome." "Tell the truth or
trump â but get the trick."
"If you would know the value of money go
and try to borrow somÂ£: for he that goes Â»-bor
rowlng goes a-sorrowing."
"Vessels large may venture more.
But little boats should keep near shore."
"These have a short Lent who owe money
to be r>ald at Easter."
Almost every American humorist since
Franklin has followed in his footstep* by
compressing hard-headed common-sen3d
into humorous aphorisms. The proverbial
philosophy of America would flil a Iarg5
.volume. Lincoln, in many ways the typi
cal American, was full of wise saws and
modern instances: "Never swap horses
when you are crossing a stream."
"You can fool all the people some of the
time and some of the people all of tha
time, but you can't fool all the people ai\
of the time."
"He's a fool who makes the doctor h!a heir."
"Ne'er take a wife till thou haat a house
(and a fire.) to rut her in."
"The cat In gloves catches no mice."
"A fat kitchen makes a lean will."
"It is foolish to lay out money In tha pur
chase of repentance."
Such exaggeration is merely comic, but
it makes up one large department of
American literature. With such literary
comedians as "Bill Xye." "M. Quad" and
"Thei Danbury News Man," it Is used
to the exclusion of almost everything else.
It comes, perhaps, from the exaggerated
idea which many Americans have of their
native land and its institutions. Nothing:
Is small in America. Barnum advertised
"the greatest sh<nv on earth." A Yankee
turns up his nos- at the Italian who \3
boasting of his Vesuvius. "Humph! Our
Niagara, would put It out in five min
utes."
There Is In all American humor a deep
current of homely common sense. In the
making of aphorisms and droll epigrams
Americans have always excelled. The be
ginnings of this, like the beginnings of so
many other things, may be traced back to
Franklin. His maxims abound, not only
in common sense, but in wit as well, and
even humor.
"Xever spare tho parson's wine nor the
bakers pudding."

âthey planted one end. and let him stand

Amerlcan. literature ' from-. Its earliest
days has abounded in Wit and humor.
Even in the colonial era,, with its.hard
ships and. 4 ts> ' religious gloom, .there, wejre
literary- comedians. Joseph" Green, born
In Boston in 1708. was so Inveterate a wag

He walks aJon* the streets. .
And throws out wit,' or what's like it,
To every one he meets.
Several of Byles' witticisms have been
preserved. During the famous dark day
of 17S0 a lady in great terror and distress
sent her son to the reverend doctor to in
quire the cause of the phenomenon. "My
dear," was the reply, "tell her I am as
muclj in the dark as she." Ha was once
defeated with his own weapon. A lady
whom he had once unsuccessfully wooed
married a Mr. Qulncey. "So, madam,
remarked the doctor, "\t appears that you
prefer a Qulncey to Byles." "Yes," was
the reply, "for if there had been anything
worse than biles God would have afflicted
Job with them."
The revolutionary era bubbled over with
wit and humor. Kranklin opened it with
a jokeâ "We must all hang together or
assuredly we snail all hang separately.
The patriot soldiers enlivened their
marches and bivouacs with "Yankee Doo
dle" and other rollicking songs. Freneau
mingled wit and satire, and Trumbull in i
"McFingal" made a satire on the Tories I
as brilliant and as original as Its great j
prototype "Hudlbras." Some of its coup- I
lets are quoted even to-day: . 7.
But optics sharp it needs, I ween.
To see what Is not to be seen.
A thief ne'er felt the halter draw
With good opinion of the law. .
Francis Hopkinson was perhaps the true
humorist of the era. His work is more
than mere fun, more than mere satire. His j
paper on "Whitewashing" is worthy of I
Irving, and his numberless other writings t
âpoems, sketches and burlesquesâ are
humorous even now in the widest sense or Â¦
the term. . .
American literature, narrowing the term
down to include only those productions
distinctively American, those productions
that are in no sense British either in at
mesphero or treatment, began with hu
morous poems and sketches. These com
menced to appear even in the colonial era.
and they increased in number and in value *
in the years Just previous to the opening j
of the great national period. It Is a sig- j
nificant fact that "the first American book j
In the higher departments of literature
which needed no apology and -stood s
squarely on Us own legs" was Irving s
"Knickerbocker," a book purely and ex
clusively humorous. The later years of
the century have witnessed an outpouring (
of humorous writings that has no parallel }
elsewhere in the history of literature. To
remove this one element would be to take
away that which, more than anything
else, gives Individuality to our literature
and enables It to stand alone. Remove
the truly American humor of Irving.
Holmes. Lowell, Warner, Harte, Artemus 1
Ward. Mark Twain, Cable, Stockton and
all like them and the strength and dis- j
tinctive flavor of our literature would be j
gone.
America has been for more than half a .
century the leading producer among the j
nations of purely humorous productions.
"Humor is ihs only literary proauct that
we export" at least in any quantities.
"Genuine, spontaneous, unstudied wit,
says a well known ..critic, "probably does
not anywhere exist to so great an extent
or in such abounding variety as in ' this
country." There seems to be something
in the American air, or at least in Ameri
can institutions and society, provocative
of wit and humor. The late Professor
Boyesen once observed that it is "the
tendency cf Americans to take a facetious
view. of life and extract the greatest
amount of amusement out of every situ
ation. â¢ â¢ â¢ The most pervasive trait In
the American national character Is Jocu
larity." Even foreigners, he observes,
who in their own country never dreamed
of making a joke, become quickly infect
ed, and after a short residence are as In
veterate wags as the natives themselves.
It is practically useless to attempt a
complete explanation of this national
characteristic. It comes partly, no doubt,
from the abundant material in America
for wit and humor. America is full of
absurdities; more so than is any other
nation. The picturesque mixing of all na
tions, the rapid growth of cities and
States, with the attendant confusion and
the difficulties of readjustment, the varie
gated and unique society" of the distant
frontiers and of the regions just strus
fllng into civilization; the Mormons, the
hakers and other picturesque communi
ties; the sudden rise of poor and unknown !
men into positions of great power and
wealth; the experiment of a new and un
tried form of government, and, above all.
the spirit of an all-leveling democracy,
which makes every man as good as his
neighbor, have all had thela influence.
Then, too, the abundant activity in Amer- i
ica. physical and mental, the rush and ,
hustle which come, some say. from the :
climate, demand a proportionate amount
of relaxation, which is found in wit and
humor. There may be, perhaps, the add- i
ed reason that 'the facetious view of life
is a kind of revolt against the puritans
of the earlier.days, the Inevitable reaction
against its extremes and its restrained
regime â but it is useless to speculate.
One of the leading characteristics of
American humor Is its exaggeration. It
abounds in startling and grotesgue hyper
boles, humorous on account of their very
extravagance. In solemn misstatements
and irrelevant antitheses. A very large
tree is described as being so tall that it
took two men and a boy to look to the
top. A certain man is so stingy that he
skims the milk on both sides. An acro
bat advertises to take in the State of
Rhode Island at one flying leap. Mark
Twain is full of this quality. A certain
man by the name of -Wheeler, he declares,
"got nipped Jsy the machinery in a car
pet factory and went through in less than
a quarter of a minute. His widow bought
the piece of carpet that had his remains
wove in, and people came a hundred miles
to 'tend the funeral. There was fourteen
yards in the piece. She wouldn't let them
roll him up, but planted him Just soâ full
length. The church was middling small
where they preached the funeral, and
they had to let one end of the coffin stick

Mayo"? Phelan yesterday- returned, with
out his approval, the bill providing; funds
for St. Mary's Square.. The bill, which ap
propriated $50,000 Immediately and pledped
the Board of Supervisors to set' asuie an
additional J50.000.for.the same purpose out
of next year's funds,' also contains a.re
lease of the original $125,000 appropriated
for thesquare by the last board and now
tied up in t|Â»e city treasury pending a
decision of..tti*e Supreme Court.. It is. al
most certain that the Mayor's vetu will
be sustained bythe baardu
The Mayor states the reasons tut his
objections to be_aa.ioJlowsi.. .._ . _.. 'i
The bill under consideration attempts to ap
propriate 130.000 "out- of available funds in the
treasury." Assuming that It Is desirable to
acquire this land. I am strongly of the opinion
that there are. not only no available funds for
the purpose but that there is no authority in
the Board of Supervisors to appropriate $50,000,
or any other sum, at 1 this time and by this
method, for the acquisition of park lands. The
charter provides (sectiens 3, 4. 3, 6 and 7, chapter
1, article III) that the Supervisors shall, by the
first Monday of June of each year, make %.
budget containing all the items of expenditure
of the city government; that the several sums
therein specified shall then be appropriated
for the eneulnsr fiscal year to the several pur
jÂ»c*es and departments therein named; that the
Supervisors must cause to be raised annually,
according to law. by tax, the sums so appro
priated; that no money shall be drawn from
the treasury unless In consequence of appro
priations, and that no warrant shall be drawn
except on an unexhausted specific appropria
tion. When tte budget was made last June
no item was Inserted nor appropriation made
tor the acquisition of this land.
If It were possible to appropriate the amount
asked for at this time, some department or
purpose for which provision was then regular
ly and specifically made would have to suffer
to the â¢ extent of the appropriation, which
would defeat the excellent fiscal plan of the
charter, unless of course there were an avail
able surplus.
It is true thare is a large surplus on account
6f the assessment roll exceeding 1375,000.000.
the basis upon which the tax levy was made.
Hut the City Attorney has. however, advised
the Board of Supervisors that this cannot be
used during this fiscal- year for any purpose,
because it will pass into the surplus fund on
July 1 next, as provided in the chater, to be
applied lster. first, to the payment of Judg
ments against the city: second, in reducing
the funded debt, and third, to be apportioned
among the funds and used in the ensuing fiscal
year as a. part of the Income and revenue
thereof: therefore it is unavailable.
For these reasons It appears to me clearly
Illegal to appropriate $30,000. "or any other sum.
at thH time out of the general fund or sur
plus fun* for the purposes contemplated, the
proper time for the board to consider such ap
propriations being next Hay and June, when
the budget, is under consideration. If it were
possible lor the board to disturb the budget in
the midst of a fiscal year by appropriating
money which was by the budgret inviolably set
aside for .other purposes, it would demoralize
the public service and create those deficits
which disgraced the city administration in
former years, and from which by strictly fol
lowing the provisions of the charter we hope
to be exempt in the future. These : provisions
as to funds and appropriations are perhaps
the most valuable in the charter, establishing,
as thÂ»y do, a paid-up and orderly government,
and when understood, all 'Interested parties

them. Â¦ ' ' â¢

Speculation in the cereals has been narrow
dull and featureless,; but prices have been
aided by shorts covering on Argentine crop re
portÂ«, advices of an exportable surplus from
that country of only 40. 000, 000 bushels and the
poor grade of receipts at the Northwest. Corn
receipts are large, but little of. it grades to
contract, while the export business holds : up
New business la plgiron Is small, but values
are steady/which indicates confidence in 'the
future outlook in spite of reiterated stories of
a large cut In ore prices next season, the prob
ability of which is ' being - denied. Bessemer
pig and steel billets are firm and the latter
market is reported well under control. Here
production ls increasing, but stocks are small
er. Finished products are a trifle quieter, but
much more active than usual at this time of
the year. Plates are active and hold all the
late advance. Business ln hardware ls very
active and at leading Western points the sea
son's business is reported the best on record
In structural material an immense amount of
business ls still being placed and specifications
are coming forward fÂ»â ely. Export trade ls
quieter and there are, cabled reports of shut
downs of Scotch iron producers. The other
metals are steady, except in tin, which Is
weak on reports of . larger shipments from thw
far East;
NEW YORK. Dec. 21.â Bradstreefa to-mor
row will, say: Seasonable conditions rule in
trade at present. Holiday trade activity ls
widespread and comparisons with previous
years are favorable at "most markets with the
possible exception of some parts of the North
west, where the spring wheat shortage and un
seasonable weather have checked distribution.
Notably cheerful reports come, too, from West
ern Jobbers, who have been called on for re-
Msorting orders/ and who report collections
good. Quietness is wholesale lines is usual at
this period, but it is to be noted that specially
good advices come from the iron and steel
hardware, groceries, fancy goods, toys and con
fectionary trades, while a distinctly cheerful
tone ls found ln shoes, leather and lumber al
though Eastern shipments of the . first-named
are still considerably smaller than last year
Industrial lines are fairly well employed and
strikes are **ew and far between. Prices show
few changes, most staples being steady, but it
might be noted . that most farm : products â¢ are
slightly higher than last week and well above
Local stocks and bonds continued dan on the
morning session, with a decline la Hawaiian
Commercial to 90%.
The feature in oil stocks was the advance in
San Joaquln to $9 50. The others were steady
to firm. In the afternoon Caribou sold up to

THE STOCK MARKET.
The Investment demand for bonds and stocks
ls notably strong and the fact that the Janu
ary income disbursements were of record
breaking magnitude Induces more or less buy
ing of an anticipatory character.
Commission houses at any rate received heavy
buying orders and the transactions once more
ran up ln the neighborhood of 1,500.000 shares
each day and once nearly to 2.000.000 shares. |
NEW YORK, Dec. 21.â Bradstreefs Financial
Review to-morrow will say: Last Saturday's
bank statement was taken by speculators as a
signal for a renewal of bullishness and for a
general buying movement. In spite of the
influence of the deals, actual and prospective,
in connection with the hard coal situation, the
possibility that the money market might be
stringent before the first of "January had ex
ercised a restraining Influence last week. It
was Intimated last Saturday morning that the
bank statement might not be a very favorable
one, but the street was hardly prepared for the
increase of $600,000 ln the surplus which the
bank I averages showed. When the statement
came out. the street promptly Jumped at the
conclusion that while a firm money market was
probable, rates might rule easier than 6 per
cent and positive stringency need not be feared.
Leading Interests ln the financial and railroad
world seemed to exert themselves to help the
bullish movement and the public shared In
the feeling of confidence.

NEVT YORK. Dec. 21.â There was no altera
tion in the character of the stock market 10
<lay. Trading continued on a very large scale.
Pofsibly the fnterest was a trifle leys broad
than on previous days of the week. The buy
lr.g showed a tendency to congestion ln cer
tain Flocks and the Ki<*>cialized strength of a
few stocks was a dominant influence in sus
taining prices. The Â«->:pectation was rather
general that a movement to tai*? profits would
develop during the duy. The prolonged con
tinuance of the rise and the Imminence of a
hoiidny both suggested the likelihood of a
protit-taking movement. Speculators as a rule
ere averse to leaving their mor.ey tied up in
the ttock market over Â» prolonged holiday and
loans made to-day cany over until Wednes
day next. The Londun market this morning
showed depression on the eve of the holiday
and this emphasized the lmprtÂ»sion of yester
day's rather char] 1 selling movement near the
close here. Professional operators there fell
upon the market at the opening, but they made
scarcely more than a momentary impression.
Powerful 6uprÂ»ort was forthcoming at the de
cline and before the end of the day the tide
of prices had turned strongly upward again.
The existence of a short Interest formed yes
terday had something to do with the resiliency,
ats the bears were very timid about leaving
accounts open over tht holidays. The con
tinued ease of money ln spite of the carrying
over of loans until Wednesday and the favor
able forecast of the bank statement gave the
final Slip to the market and it closed ani
mated and strong at about the top level, the
late proSt-taklng Biles being confidently ab
i-orbed. Northern Pacific cold ex-divldend and
recovered Etrnngly from yesterday's late re
action. But the top price was &4. which .was
f-hort of yesterday's price by half a point.
The extraordinary speculation in Northern Pa
cific lc based on the benefit to accrue from
the retirement of the preferred stock, cancel
ing its privilege to fchare net earnings in ex
ce?Â« of 4 per cent on the common. This called
AVtc York Stock Market.

CHICAGO, Dec. 21.â Wheat prices were main
tained the greater part of the session and the
undertone was a trifle easy. With Liverpool
firm, Argentine shipments smaller than the
week Drevlous. with moderate Northwest re
ceipts and an unusually heavy export flour de
mand reported from Minneapolis, May opened
only %c higher at 73ji73%c. and then quickly
slumped to 72%c. Here the ehorts began to
, take cocnlzance of the situation as shown by
the early news and a reaction began. This
was helped along later by reports of an ex
port demand and by St. Louis purchasing,
under which May rallied to 73%c. The bulge
met the usual profit-taking, but the close was
steady, May %o, higher at 73@73%c.
Corn was heavy and dull, both for near and
distant future?. December was for sale at the
start and there seemed to be no demand. The
close was l%c under yesterday at 3S94c. Janu
ary closed %c down at 36*4c May %@Vic
lower at 33%(836c.
Oats were dull. May closed unchanged.
Provisions were quiet. The market opened
fairly steady, but eased later ln sympathy with
a decline in hogs and the slump in corn. Janu

assured of a sufficiency this winter. The pres
ent daily output of fuel oil ln this State is
fully 12,000 barrels. Computing say four bar
rels (it is somewhat less) to the ton of aver
age coal for steam production, it can be read
ily seen that a number of large coal con
sumers ore now substituting oil. Coal produ
cers have little fear that they will not find
an outlet for their output in 1971. although oil
may prove a formidable competitor; their sales
this year are in excess of last, and the gen
eral Increased fuel demand from a number of
eonrces promised in the near future will prob
ably make 1301 the banner year for volume of
coal sales. Australtan and English shipments
are becoming exceptionally scarce, as their
high import cost precludes thÂ»ir finding buyers
at covering figures. It ls many years since the.

Failures for the week were 293 in the United

Wheat ls quiet, receipts aggregating 4,802,779
bushels, against 3,306.289 last year, while At
lantic exports were 2.701.412 bushels (flour in
cluded), against only 1,536.164 bushels in the
same week of 1899.
Instead of the holiday quiet in the wool
market, the last week's figures of sales at the
three chief Eastern markets amount to 7,238,
000 pounds, against 6,785,000 pounds in the pre
ceding week, and 5,627,400 pounds two weeks
ago. Prices are steady, but show no recovery
from the recent decline, and manufacturers
purchase only raw material to fill orders. An
other decline appeared ln hides at Chicago,
taking the average back to the level prevailing
two months ago. Leather was also easier.
NEW YORK, Dec. 21.â R. O. Dun St Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow . will say:
Better weather conditions on the Atlantic : sea
board and pronounced activity in distribution
of all staple lines of merchandise at Southern
cities have imparted a slightly more aggres
sive tone to general business. Distinctive holi
day business, which at this period of the sea
son means retail distribution, has shown fur
ther improvement and no complaint is heard
from any quarter, while the jewelry trade ls
much more active than for several years past.
Lnchanged conditions in the leading manufac
turing industries during the last week before
the holidays mean much. At this time in or
dinary years furnaces close down in large num
bers and dullness ls general at mills, and shops
where iron and steel are handled. Instead of
reductions of working force or concessions ln
price this year, however, reports from the
principal cities indicate the existence of con
tracts that will take months to fill and new
sales are made at the. former level, despite
much talk of cheaper ore next year.
Other industries exhibit the same indifference
to precedent..

was a very notable exception, the dealings ln
these shares being th^ most active remembered
in London for many years. ,
In the. street prices continued to bound up
wildly, but the larger houses here think that
the movement has now been overdone, the pub
lished news not being sufficient to Justify so
great an advance.

of J10 50 for December before delivery helped
to intensify the excitement. At the close the
market was barely eteady. with prices net 22

OAKLAND. Dee. 21.â The Pardee wins
of the Republican party haa taken the
first step toward launching an opposition
movement to the committee of twenty
eight. The new boom wae started at a
meeting called together to-night by Â£.
H. Lake, M. K. Foster. H. H. Klrby. G.
Russell Lukens and Dr. George C. Par
dee, and held at Loring.Hall. About two
hundred attended. G. Russen Lukens was
chosen chairman and he immediately en
tertained a resolution offered b Dr. Par
dee authorizing the chair to appoint a
committee "coneiBtlng of three men from
each ward in the city to devise ways and
means to combat the treacherous action
of the Republican City. Central Commit
tee."
The following named spoke to the reso
lution, denouncing the late city cornmit
tee for its action and advocating the nom
ination of a Republican municipal ticket
which would bring to Its support the
friends of reform: Professor L. D. Ins
keep. W. D. Dow. L. J. Hardy, Pelton
Taylor. F. R. Girard. M. A. Thomas,
Henry Burns. Thomas M. Robinson and
Hugh Cameron.
Professor Inskeep said the purchasing
of votes on the committee was a disgrace
which all good citizens should resent. He
thought that Dr. Fardee's resolution
rhould be adopted. Felton Taylor de
nounced the personnel of the committee
of twenty-eight appolntod by the central
committee, "itead the names." he said;
"that Is enough. Â¦ They are notoriously
crooked from flri>t to last. They are the
gang that engineered the Lake Merntt
steal; they are the gang that got up the
fake interviews with Councllmen l>.v
which It was nought to deliver the city
over to the water monopoly."
Councilman Girard said that the City
Central Committee, having sold out to
boodlerf, no longer represented the. Re
publican party, but that the real Repub
lican party was represented by thos>e
present at to-night's meeting who were in
favor of clean city government.
Henry Burns said: "Let this commit
tee be a' people's committee. Put on me
chanics and laboring men as well as mer
chants and other business men. Then we
will eweep the field."
Hugh Cameron advocated making tha
committee non-partisan. "Let us put a
ticket In the field." he 6aid, "that will
command the support of all who are In
favor of good government. Democrats as
well aa Republicans. If we put a rival
Republican ticket In the field we shall
purely fail."
Chairman Lukens replied to the last
speaker, saying that it was a mistake to
punish the party for the crime of indi
viduals.
When the resolution was put to a vote
it was adopted unanimously. The chair-
man announced that he would make the
appointments called for In the resolution
as soon as practicable.
This movement will not be non-partisan
or municipal league in form, though
many municipal league members will take
part. It will be called a Republican
move, otherwise it would lay Dr. Pardee
who Is a prospective candidate for Gov
ernor. Henry P. Dalton and State Sen
ator G. R. Lukens, who are Republican
officeholders, open to a charge of bolt
ing the party ticket. This was the rea
son why Hugh Cameron's non-partlÂ«Â»an
suggestion was bo promptly disposed of
This makes a direct contest between fac
tJonÂ«Â«, and a bitter fight 'is on.
Henry P. Dalton to-night sent the fol
lowing letter withdrawing from the com
mittee of twenty-eight:

TOPEKA, Kans.. Dec. 2Lâ President
Dolphin of the Order of Railroad Tele
graphers has declared the strike of the
operators on the Santa Fe off. All the
striking operators here received orders
to-night from President Dolphin that the
strike would continue no longer.
The operators are beginning tÂ«>~ specu
late as to whether they will be reinstat
ed in the employ of the company. They
now have the permission of the organi
zation to work if they can secure work.
General Manager Mudge would not ex
press an opinion a3 to whether the men
would be re-employed or not. He said,
however, that the Order of Railroad Tele
graphers would not be recognized under
the present management.
"Let the operators get new officers." ho
said, "and then, we will talk to them."
HOUSTON. Tex.. Dec. 21.â Tha strike of.
the telegraphers ot the Gulf, Colorad3
and Santa fe Railroad was called off tu
night. It Is presumed that there will be
issued at once an order calling off thj
strike on all branches of the Atchison
system, but the committee of the Order
of Railway Telegraphers on the Gulf lino
has jurisdiction over Texas alcne. Tha
strike was begun in Texas ttfteen days
aso. No concessions were asked by tho
men or offered by the company as a pre
liminary to calling off the strike.
Following is the official circular Issued
to-night:
OALVESTON, Texas, Dec 21.â To Members
of the Order of Railway Telegraphers and
Friends of the Order, Gulf, Colorado and Santa
Fe> Railroad: Alter a most careful and earn
est consideration of the entire situation, your
further the straggle inaugurated on the UnÂ» of
the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe road. With
the causes leading up to the most stubborn
fight ever known in the history of our order
you are familiar: with the conduct of the cam
paign you have been kept as faithfully ad
vised as the plans of your committee would
permit, and if we have failed in our desire to
keep you In full touch with the situation. It
has been from lack of time and facilities, not
negligence. Wa have done our best, and only
regret that your effort and ours have not
brought U3 the victory which we feel was de
served.
- The loss of the battle or of a campaign dot-a
not Indicate that the cause was wrong. His
tory 1Â» laden with just such events, and out
of our defeat it may be there shall come a
victory for right and humanity which those
who come after us shall enjoy and bless vn
for the noble stand we took. Let no man loolc
back with regret. Our destiny lies beforÂ« us.
not behind us, and the men who for fifteen
days made the gallant fight that you have arn
the men who will wrest from tha futura the
success and prosperity which the present has
denied them. Some of your number will suffer
loss; some will seek and find better position*
than they held, for no railroad employe iÂ»
more capable and worthy than thoÂ»Â« who an
swered the call of our leaders on December 8.
In conclusion your committee simply deslr?s
to add that we "individually have felt honore-i
by the steadfast courage ajid unwavering loy
alty which you have given us. and in bt<1dinsr
us perhaps a lifelong farewell, we feel trury
that wÂ« have been assisted In this strusgla
with brethren rather than fellow -craftsmen.
May God proÂ»rÂ»r earn of you.
Therefore, from and after 12 ofclock noon.
Saturday, December ZZ, the Order of Railway
Telegraphers will cease to be in a state of
conflict with the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fa

Mr. Pearson said he was opposed to the
boycott. He does not anticipate that the
reliable men who have gone out during
the strike will have any difficulty in pro
curing employment, many of them from
the Santa Fe Company.
CHICAGO, Dec. 21.-Thlrd VlcÂ« Presi
dent Barr of the Santa Fe system said
to-nlj?ht upon beins Informed that the
telegraphers' strike had been declared off:
"As far as we are concerned. It has
been off a long time. We have all the
men we need at present, and we will dis
charge none of -them to make room for
any striker -who wishes to come back.
These men broke their contract with, us
In a manner entirely unjustifiable, and
we are done forever with the telegraph
ers as an organization. The strike natur
ally caused us annoyance at first, but this
lasted only for a few days, and then wo
were In first-class Bhape again."
FRESNO, Dec. 21.â Local Chairman
Haya of the Order of Railway Telegraph
ers to-night received the following dis
patch from President M. M. Dolphin:
CHICAGO. Dec. a.-^J. W. Hays. Fresno:
The strike pending on the Santa Fe system u
hereby declared off. Notify air to promptly
apply for re-employment. M. M. DOLPHIN.
But six men In Chairman Hays' division
responded to the _ call to strike when It
Issued, bo the new order does not affect
the telegraphers here very extensively.
Chairman Hays would not express any
opinion as to the likelihood of the men
getting back Into the road's employ, but
hi? manner Indicated that he had serious
doubts about it.
Nothing could be learned conr#rnlng the
Intentions of the Santa Fe. The local offi
cers contented themselvea with the state
ment that they had all the operators thor
needed and no vacancies were In sight for
the near future.

For the past ten years Colonel Carroll
had been practically an Invalid and since
1S96 has been confined tc his room la the
County Hospital. He had no relatives In
California and had of late years lived a
secluded life, seeing no one but the hoa

had been accustomed to all the luxuries
and social prestige of the old aristocracy.
Among his associate* In his prosper
ous days he was commonly known as
"Prince Charlie," and nis courteous bear
ing and genial ways won him many
friends. For several vears he was pri
vate secretary to Senator George Hearst.

one of the fraternal organizations with
which he was identifier} in his lifetime.

Figures Finally Admitted by
the Monopoly's Counsel
in Rate Case.
In connection with the adjournment
it developed that the company was prac
tically ready to rest its case. It Is there
fore probable that the city's witnesses
will go on soon after the holidays and
that the long hearing is drawing to its
close. V
This afternoon the case went over until
January 2, with the understanding that
Judge Hayne should have a- continuance
of another week If he needed It.
Hayne then asked what sacredness In
hered in the company's books that they
were so jealously guarded.
Attorney Moore replied that books of
account were Indeed sacred and that
courts did not allow an adverse party to
inspect them without -good cause.
Judge Hart observed that the city's ex
perts should be allowed to inspect any
books throwing light on the question of
income.
At this McCutchen agreed to admit an
income of $414,158 92. as before stated.
"That book possesses a very particular
interest Inasmuch as every one of. you
from the beginning of this case has gone
on the stand and sworn there, was no
such record. Now I have stumbled on
the fact that it does exist and is in the
company's office, and I am exceedingly
interested in getting possession of it."
"That book wouldn't be of any essen
tial importance or interest to you,"- ob
jected McCutchen. Judge Hayne re
torted:
The testimony concerning the com
pany's Income was not elicited without
considerable opposition. Having extract
ed the admission from the witness that a
book was In existence giving the desired
data. Judge Hayne immediately demand
ed Its production in -court.
During the cross-examination of the
company's bookkeeper. T. E. Hanson, \*.
transpired tnat last year the company
collected $114,158 92. This is a profit of
over thirteen per cent on the capital in
vested according to the valuation of the
city's expert engineers. The income. If
the new ordinance should cause all the
diminution in profit contended for by tha
company's attorneys, would amount to
eight per cent on the same valuation. This
diminution ia far from being admitted by
Judge Hayne. He has already in his
cross-questioning shown many contradic
tions in the opposition's estimates - an1
promises further disclosures whe,n he puts
nis own witnesses on the stand.
The city's attorney In the water rate
case has finally brought to light the
amount of the Contra Costa company's
income. This enables the percentage of
Its profit on its investment to be com
puted and lays bare the central fact about
which the whole controversy has beei
waged.

about half of the money eroes to pay for
his purchases in the Hungarian capital,
another will, no doubt, be required. Thus,

Sreeial Cable to The Call and New York Her
ald. CoryrlEht. 1900. by the Herald Pub
lishing Company.
PARIS, Dec. 22.â The Aurore this morn
ing reopens the Dreyfus ulcer with Zola's
scalpel. Zola addresses M. Loubet m
ringing trumpet tones.
"Monsieur Le President: Almost three
years ago I addressed to your predeces
sor, Felix Faure, a letter which he Ig
nored,, unfortunately for his fair fame.
Now he lies numbered with the dead, his
memory clouded by the monstrous in
iquity at Which he connived in so far aa
he used the powers of his high office to
shield the guilty. .
"To-day that abominable affair, after
having sullied all governments, particips
criminis, or cowardly, that have followed
one another, had culminated for a brief
space In a supreme denial of Justice. The
bill of amnesty which the Chambers have
just voted is *a bill that history will stig
matize as 'Infamous amnesty.'
"Following in the steps of others, your
government la stumbling over the same
fault' of accepting most overwhelming re
sponsibility. Rest assured It Is not a pago
of our life that is being besmirchedâ it is
the magistracy that is running the risk
of being coupled with that of your prede
cessor, stained as it were with an Inef
faceable stain." ;Â£&:.
M Zola then claims the right to relieve
his anguish by again lifting up his voice,
pointing out that for a year and a half he
has awaited the . coming of slow-footed
justice. Instead of Justice he now see?
arrived an Insulting and Infamous am
nesty which bunches together Picquart
and Esterhazy, Relnach and De Paty du
Clam, Zola himself and Mercler.
After reviewing the possible conse
quences of amnesty, Zola points out that
events have justified the declarations he
made In his letter to Felix Faure and then
reiterates them to President Loubet.
"I have said that the fourth act of the
drama had been played at Rennes and
that there would necessarily be a fifth
act The anguish of that fear is always
In my heart. There Is a tendency to for
get that the German Emperor holds the
truth in his hand -and that he can cast It
In our teeth when the hour, which he has
perchance already chosen, shall have
Â°Â°"That would.be a fearful fifth act of
which I am In constant dread and the
terrible eventuality of which the French
Government ought not: to- tolerate for a
moment.. We have been promised a ver
dict of history- I call your attention to
that. M. le . President, history will tell
what you have done. You will have your
page, 'reflect upon thatâ that poor Felix
Faure, the denied tanner, who was so
popular at the outset of his career and
â¢who had Impressed even me by his demo
cratic good-fellowship, will abide for all
time as merely an unjust and weak crea
ture who allowed an Innocent man to suf
fer martyrdom. 'Would you not be pleased
to figure In -marble -as a man of truth and
Justice? There. Is perhaps /time yet."
Addresses a Stinging Let

1118 Broadway, Dec. 21.
Brother I-asrian. for thirty years en
paged in the work of the Christian Broth
erq ni:d one of the fonmosi Latriolic edu
cators, passed away to-day at St. Â¦ Mc"Vs
College. Brother Uascian had been fail
ing for several months. Brlght's disease
had fastened its fata! grip upon him and
he knew the end was approaching. On
account of the condition of his health he
was forced to give up the direction of St.
James College at Vancouver and come to
St. Mary's College] where he would be
surrounded by tfu- friends and the asso
ciates of years during his last hours.
Every comfort was afforded the dying
brother, and in the presence of sorrowful
intimates his life went out.
Brother Laseian was born in Ireland
fifty-two years ago. Hia worldly name
was John Melody. He has several rela
tives in San Francisco. During. a good
part of the time he was a member of the
Christian Brothers, covering a period of
thirty years, he has been In Oakland. Ho
first "came to Oakland In 18S3, occupying
the position of director of St. James Acad
emy until 1SS9. when he went to St. Mary's
Coflese in San Francisco as an Instructor.
In 1*97 fie returned to Oakland as a mem
ber of the faculty at St. Mary's College.
Later Brother Lasclan established a
school in Santa Cruz, but the arduous
work forced him to give it up last spring.
Then he was appointed to take charge of
the college at Vancouver, from which be
csme back to Oakland. â¢
Brother Lapcian was of a very lovlne
disposition and his loss will be mourned
by the brothers of the order of which he
was a member and hundreds of young
men who were once his pupils.

lem of maintenance should be made by
the Legislature. In order that the na
tional allowance of $100 per annum for
each deserving and Indigent veteran may
b* utilized to lighten the burden on thi
various counties of. the State. Member*
of the Legislature may enlighten them
selves as to conditions Imposed by thÂ«
General Government. If the State take
away a percentage of pensions paid to
veterans In the home then the Govern
ment deducts the amount so taken from
the allowance to the State. The National
Bo f rd .,? f Managers insists that the sick
and ailing veterans shall have the best
medical attention. It Is enjoined that
amusements shall be afforded, that new
books and magazines shall be added to
the ibrary, that the band shall discourse
music and that everything possible shall
be done to minister to the happiness and
comfort of the aged veteran*.
The national Idea is that nothing In the
land is too good for the men who went
to the front In defense of the country
The Legislature will be asked to appro^
priate a proper sum to meet the State's
small share of the cost of maintenance,
but not a dollar will be asked for on the
ground of charity.

McDonald's Concert To-Night
William McDonald, the basso. Is the
victim of a sad fate. He -was working:
as a blacksmith In San Mateo and occa
sionally singing in the cause of sweet
charity. His magnificent voice attracted
the notice of the Bostonlans when they
were playing here. McDonald was en
gaged and went East with the company.
While singing with the Bostonians he was
taken sick with pneumonia. When he re
covered from his Illness It was found that
the disease had affected his eyes. He was
brought back to California, his home,
and It was thought that he would soon
fully recover,- but it has taken several
months for his eyes to even show the
slightest sign of improvement. To-night
there will be a concert given In Sherman
& Clay's -hall for his benefit. It Is hoped
that those who In the past have been
charmed with his voice will remember
their old favorite and by their attendance
financially assist the unfortunate singer.
The programme of the evening follows :

The directors of the Veterans' Home,
Napa County, have resolved to ask the
Legislature to increase the annual State
allowance for the maintenance of that
institution from $45,000 to $60,000. The
amount was fixed at $45,000 in IS33, when
411 veterans were maintained at the in
stitution. At the present time there are
740 veterans, at the home, and sixty-eight
on leave" of absence. The allowance of
the United States is fixed at $100 per an
num for each veteran in the home, and
Is, therefore, nearly twofold greater than
it was in 1S93, while the California allow
ance has not increased since then.
j Two years ago the Veterans' Home As
sociation conveyed to the State of Cali
fornia 900 acres "of land, together with
buildings and improvements thereon. The
value of the property'so conveyed approx
imates $350,000. As the institution has re
ceived but slight financial support from
the State, ana has never adopted the
policy of importuning the Legislature for
appropriations, many Senators and As
semblymen have not had occasion* to ob
serve its magnitude or study its require
ments. The general opinion Is entertained
that the State allowance has kept pace
with the Increase of membership.
It ia an Institution open at all times to
proper inspection. There are no special
days for visitors One can visit the prem
ises any day and form his own Judgment
regarding the manner in which the home
Is conducted.
Inspector generals In the service of the
United States make annual or semi-an
nual tours of Inspection. They 'seldom
give advance notice of their coming.
They inspect the hospital, the barracks
the Â¦ cottages, the post exchange, the li
brary, the band, billiard hall, tne electric
plant and light system, the ice plant, the
boilers, machinery, drainage pipes
kitchen . and " dining-room, clothing, food,
springs and reservoirs, the farm, the cat
tle, horses and -chickens. Report of ob
servation is made to the board of man
agers of Homes for Disabled Volunteer
Soldiers and Sailors.
The institution in Napa County stands
fourth on the list of State homes. It is
excelled in importance only by homes in
New York, Ohio and Illinois. In many
respects It is unexcelled. In equipment
of hospital it may be somewhat deficient
in modern requirements. Owing to in

tention that it will henceforth receive
Storage capacity has been developed that

vation of the grounds.
The Veterans' Home of California Â«s not
a charitable or reformatory Institution
The veterans residing there are citizens
of the State. Only dtlxens of California
can be admitted to the home. These citi
zons might become objects of charity and
a burden on the State If the General Gov
ernment- did not make the allowance of
$100 per annum for each and every mem
ber of the home. If the State Homo did
not exist the, whole cost of supporting the
740 veterans at the home would probably
fall on the counties of the State. -.Veter
ans residing Jn any State of the Union
are. admissible to the National Home at
Santa Monica, but all the space there is
taken and the waiting list is a long one
The authorities at Washington have de
cided that disabled veterans of the Span
ish war are entitled to admission to State
homes which derive support from the
national Government. Therefore -dis
abled : and Undigent soldiers and sailors
of the campaigns In Cuba and the Philip

Charles Stencil, alias Stinson, alias Sta
tion, who has blossomed out as a clever
bunko steerer, has a record. When *'Jim"
Corbett began to have aspirations as a
first-class pugilist Stencil was in the pro
duce business and had accumulated about
$15,000. He decided to be a first-class
sport, and became Corbett's backer In his
fight with Peter Jackson before the Cal
ifornia Athletic Club, over ten years ago.
He then took Corbett East and lost con
siderable money.
Stinson returned to the city, and proved
an easy victim for sure-thing men and
followers of the race track. In the be
ginning of 1833 he had trouble with a
woman of the "tenderloin" named Winnie
Stanton, and she threw vitriol in his face,
but he saved himself from being seriously
burned. She was arrested, and in July of
that vear was rentenced to five years in
San Quentin. She threatened to kill him
as soon as she was released, but. as he Is
still alive, she has probably ; reconsidered
her intention.
Recently he has come into prominence
again. He got mixed up in a deal with a
farmer whereby the farmer lost a large
consignment of potatoes. Four weeks ago
he was one of the men arrested for visit-
Ing a faro game in the Burlington House,
and Thursday of last week he was ar
rested for steering Edward A. Palmer, a
young student, to a room on Post street
and fleecing him out' of $130. He also ac
companied Palmer to the Columbian Bank
to get a letter of credit for $5000 cashed,
which led to his arrest. He was released
on bonds, and Thursday night he was
again arrested for steering Robert Teeter,
a visitor from Washington, D. C. to a
room at 405 Kearny street, where Teeter
was relieved of $180.
Yesterday Stencil and his friend_, G. H.
Lawrence, appeared before Judge Ca
banlss In the Palmer case. They confi
dently expected Â¦ that Palmer would not
appear to prosecute, and the case was
continued till Monday. Palmer made his
appearance Just as the case had been con
tinued, much to their dismay, and hÂ«
promised to be on hand Monday morning.
Stencil also appeared before Judge Fritz
In the Teeter case, and It was continued
till to-day.

MAMIE FISHER, a tailoress, em
ployed by Roos Brothers, was
arrested yesterday afternoon
and charged with slashing Max
Singer three times across the
left arm with a knife. The trouble oc
curred in the tailoring department of
Roos Brothers, where Singer is also em
ployed.
According to the story told by Singer,
he -was altering a pair of trousers when
he picked up a knife belonging to one of.
his fellow-workmen. Miss Fisher im.
mediately commanded him to put down
the knife, and as he refused, he claims,
she took the weapon from him and
slashed him across the arm.
Singer's statement is denied by Miss
Fisher. She says that since Singer was
given employment by the clothiers, which
was about three weeks ago, he has been
constantly annoying her. Only a few days
ago, she claims, he called her a vile name
and threatened to make her a subject for
the Coroner.
"When he picked up the knife," she

said, in telling her version of the
trouble, "I told him that as It did not be
long to him he had no right to touch it.
W ith the knife ' in his liand he came
toward me, when I again asked him to
put It down. For a reply he struck me in
tne breast, and aa I staggered back he
aimed another blow at my face. At this
Juncture I grabbed his uplifted arm and
after a short struggle took : the knife
away from him.- As he continued to
strike me I picked up a board' such as is
used by tailors and struck him across the
arm. He then left the place and I sup
pose told the police that I had cut him.
My hand was slightly cut while trying to
get possession of: the knife. I d!d not
U3e the knife on -him; and I defy him or
anybody else to prove that I did."
Shortly' after being taken, to the City
Prison Miss Fisher was released on cash
bail furnished by one of the Roos broth
ers.

Dr. Kinyoun's stay on this coast as Fed
eral Quarantine Officer Is very likely to be
curtailed. The loud murmurings . in the
business community against this unpopu

leng since reached the ears of Federal
authorities at "Washington. A report con
cerning the doctor's administration will
be sent to Washington by Collector Strat

Dr. Kinyoun Is mere conjecture, but when
the Secretary of the Treasury receives a
copy of the resolutions passed by the San
Francisco Chamber of Commerce, to quote
ths language of Collector Stratton, "there
wlll.be something doing."
Copies of the resolutions adopted at the
last meeting of the board of trustees of

Â¦Whereas, From time to time complaints have

arriving here, consignees of vessels and those
expecting mail from foreign ports, of the un-
necessary delay, general inconvenience and
hardship caused them by the officials of United

Whereas, Particular attention has been
called to the case of the Occidental and Ori
ental steamship Coptic, which arrived here on
September 30. lÂ»00, at about 7:33 p. m.. from
Yokohama and Honolulu, when the passengers
were most Indignant at the manner in which
the physical examination of their bodies was
conducted. According to the evidence of many
of the passengers, among whom were mer
chants, professional men and others of the
highest standing and reputation, the examin
ations were made without proper regard to de
cency, privacy, modesty or cleanliness, some
of the passengers declaring that they would
under no circumstances araln come to or
through this port, preferring to land at Cana
dian ports, where more courtesy and consider
ation were shown: and. where&s. we have been
informed that transportation companies In
Canada have published and distributed the
complaints of the needless hardships and trials
Buffered by paasengers arriving here. In order
to divert this travel from the United States to
their country: and. whereas, occurrences of
this nature are a serious detriment to the bus
iness of our port and are a menace to our
trade and commerce; therefore the Chamber of
Commerce of San Francisco have
IVcsolred. That we hereby most respÂ«ctfully
and earnestly ursre upon the honorable the Sec
retary of the Treasury that the officer in
charge of the quarantine station at this port
be instructed to perform the duties of his of

ejepoeed to Insult, needless delay, hardship and

may be treated with due consideration and
courtesy, and no hindrance be placed upon thy

Wong Chung, a Chinese merchant, filed

yesterday asking for a writ of mandate
requiring Federal Quarantine Officer Kin
youn. to show cause why he should not be
compelled to release certain frelg-ht which
was brought from Hongkong to this city
by the Coptic on her last trip. The freight
consists of yams, lily bulbs, dried ducks,
dried fish. *.aro and otfier Chinese luxu

the articles to be landed because they
came from an Infected port.
Judge Morrow issued an order citing
Dr. Kinyoun to appear before him on
January 7 at 11 a. m. A further order was
made prohibiting the doctor and the Oc
