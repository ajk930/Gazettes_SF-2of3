but he could not give even so good a de
scription of his customer as the little girls
could give of the man Who followed them.
It is believed, however, that the man who
bought the acid is the man who sprinkled
acid over the children.
The stains j made by the stuff on the
girls' dresses are not distinctive of any
particular acid, owing perhaps to the dyes
used in the cloth. The jackets they wore
â¢were new ones of the tan shade, so much
in vogue. The spots on the jackets were
black or dark brown. On the woolen
dresses the spots were red, and on the hat
of one, where the acid had been poured,
the cloth had burned black and the stuff
had eaten a hole clear through it. There

The assault caused a great deal of ex
citement, and Dr. Bass at once notified
the police. Detective Coleman was sent
out to the house, and after questioning
the girls and their parents he started on
a hunt for the acid thrower. He inquired
all through the neighborhood, but could
find no trace of the man. Â¦ The only infor
mation he could find that might have a
bearing on the acid thrower's identity* was
the statement of a drug clerk in the drug
store on the northwest corner of Jackson
and Polk streets. The clerk said that late
Saturday evening a man came in and
asked for two-bits' worth of muriatic acid.

against his legs as he walked; his coat
short, around his neck a black silk em
broidered muffler with purple flowers, or
as one of the children thought, white
ones. This he wore around his neck and
crossed In front of his chest. As to his
hat the children could not agree, but they
believe it was a derby.
The neighborhood is quite worked up
over the occurrence, as It has always been
considered a locality particularly free
from any danger to children, and boys and
girls have been allowed to come and go
almost as they pleased. To have such a
character roaming around is most dia
quieting to the parents, for there is no
means of knowing when the man will
make his presence known again in a
similar way, and the next time his vic
tims may not escape with only ruined
clothing".
A piece of Mabel's sailor cap was taken
by Detective Coleman and the character
of the fluid used will be ascertained. If
it prove to be muriatic acid the clew from
the drugstore will be of considerable*
value. In any event the police will make
a special effort to find the miscreant, for
he is a menace to children who must
travel alone upon the street
approached Van Ness avenue he reached
over and poured what was left in the bot
tle on Mabel's cap. It soaked into the
cap and ran down into her' hair and onto
her jacket. It was this that made her turn
round, and as she did so,- she says, she
saw the man with the bottle still in his
hand, holding It as he would have held a
cigarette. The acid on the child's hair
was washed out as quickly as possible.
The cause of the assault and Its object
are as much of a mystery to the girls and
their parents as to everyone else. â¢ It was
some wild freak of a crank, and a danger
ous one. and from his actions it .la not
known whether he was attempting to dis
figure the children with the burning liquid
or merely wished to ruin ; their clothes.
Had any of the stuff touched the skin it
.would have burned its way deep into the
flesh of the children as quickly, if not
more quickly, 1 than it did into their
clothing. The man spoke noi word.

their jackets, burned holes in

their hats. It was by the merest chance
the acid did not reach their faces and
disfigure them for life.
The assault took place on Green street,
between Franklin and Van Ness avenue.
It was in the morning, and the children
were on their way to church. As It hap
pened there was no one in sight when the
man came up behind them, and when
they saw what he was doing and called
out he escaped down Green street and
disappeared in a little blind alley known
as Bonlta street, which opens into Polk

Yesterday morning, dressed in their pre'.

down Green street, and had reached
Franklin, when they saw a man coming
down the latter street from toward Va

except to remark that he was not partic

were dark. The children paid no at
tention to him, but kept on down
Green street until, when close to
Van Ness avenue, they noticed that
some one was following them, and
what attracted their attention was that
Mabel believed the man had spat upon
her. She turned Indignantly and spoke to

The officers fell justified, in view of the
alleged Improvement in conditions, to re-.

H. V. Madge; genera! manager of the
road, pert out a general cruer this after
noon to al! operators wh.7 had rot yet
gone out offering to promote th?m if they
would continue in their resistance to the
Ftrike. He told them that they had been
faithful to the interests of the company
thus far. an>l that they could fill out their
application blanks for better positions at
once. The genera! manager added that
all the men not takirg part in the strike
should have better positions if they were
capable of filling tli'-m. and that thfir old
place* would be tilled from outside
sources.
Mr. Mudfre expressed gr^at satisfaction
this eveningr at the order he had sent out.
and said it was only fair that the com

who had been faithful to their interests.

result of the ptrike than I did last nieht."
raid Mr. Mudge. "I thought then that we
â¢would have a serious time. In this be
lief the crder was issued for the closing
down of the shops. To-day the conditions
eeem to have so much improved that the
ordÂ«r closing the shops will be rescinded.
I think we can use all our men in the old
tray. This much is certain, however, not
one of the men who has gone out on the
Ftrike Â¦will be taken back into u.e employ
of the company. Those who were former
ly below them will be promoted over their
heads and they will see that the road can
get alor.g without them. Some of the
strikers have already made application
to be reinstated in the employ cf the com
pany, but it will be of no use. This will be
permanent. They left our employ without
cause cjid now they will have' to suffer for
their neglect-"
General llanasrer Madge, in company
with some other of the* officials of his
road, spent several hours at the telegraph
keys in the general office oÂ£ the road to
<5ay. transmitting the necessary messages.
They have adopted the plan of Fending
much of their matter by mail.
This morning It sÂ»eemed as thouch the
â¢Aerators had decided to go to work
epain. and the officials feu relieved from
their duties at the key. Some few oper
ators returned to work under the lnisap
prehenston that the strike had been de
dareu off, but soon left again.
C T. McÂ«"le!lan. superintendent of the
Eastern division, returned this afternoon
from a trip of Inspection over the rntire
division in his private car. Ho started out
yesterday afternoon as soon as the news
of the strike became kr.own. He reported
that matters were very satisfactory so
far "as the Eastern division was con
cerned. Mr. McClellan visited all the
fj)cra.tors mlmng the route and asked them
jioint blank if they intended to nt like. In
case a man would answer in the affirm
ative he would be quickly Informed that
his services would no longer be needed,
and a time check was given him. This

ators agreed to remain at wori To-day,
however, many who made such an agree
ment struck as soon as they ascertained
the facts in the case.
â¢'Probably twenty operators are out on
my division to-night," said Mr. McClcl
lan. "but I have men In sight for all these

Chicago, JCansas City and St. Louis and
poon all the stations on the division 'will

V.'. ii. Coombs, chief dispatcher for the
Eastern division, reported that all the
trains were running satisfactorily. ' Some
were late, but that was a natural conse
tjuence. lie said that the plan has been
adopted of pending all the west-bound
freights over the cutoff from Argentine
to Kmporia, where they could take the
double track west. The east-bound
freights will be dispatched on the main
line.
~*r. Coombs said that most of the
Trouble came from the men on the Ar
gentine cutoff. When any of the so-called
"faithful" men would attempt to send a

rnr-snage would be lost. However, he

At 3:30 o'clock this morning an official

a depot operator to go to work, When the
operator arrived the -oflicial represented

he had better return to work as every

They were informed that the strike was
practically Fettled and the only thing for
them to do was to return to work. This
many of them did, and It began to look

the strike is solid.
Passenger Trains Late.
ALBUQUERQUE, Dec. 9.â The strike of
the Santa Fe operators is beginning to be
felt here. Passenger trains are all several
hours late to-night and while there are
plenty of operators here, freight trains
are tied up waiting for orders at several
stations where men have gone out. The
closing of the Ehops here will throw GOO
men out and greatly interfere with busi

IX Europe and America the Impression prevails that the Chi
nese came off "second best" in their encounters with the Euro
pean trtops. The Chinese know better. They are evidently un
der the impression that any fact may be denied out of exist
ence, and it is espec ially the Chinese cartoonist whose ser
vices are employed to "save face" by informing the' unthinking
masses that China's troops were universally successful. The Kol
nisehe Zeitung (Cologne) gives the following descriptions of the
prims whicji are circulated among the people:
"There is the supposed recapture of Tientsin Â¦ by General Tung
Fuh Slang. A mine explodes with tremendous force, and ,the sever
ed limbs of the unfortunate 'foreign devils' are decorating 1 the air.
The road to the sea is full of flying Europeans, who are mercilessly
slaughtered by the Chinese, and' -who are cut off from the water.
Some Europeans have reached tho boats, but â¢ the Chinese swim
after them and kill them. i .
"The best is,' however, a naval battle. A number of torpedoes,
looking 1 suspiciously like bedbugs, are drifting toward the battle
ships. One exceptionally brave Chinaman swims off to the fleet,
attacking an Ironclad with a huge knife. Near by a battleship is
blown up. Unfortunately the Chinese show little mercy to the
prisoners even In these pictures. These unfortunates arÂ© brought
before the doughty Tungr Fuh Slang in chains, and after a short
trial they are despatched. Such prints are by no means rare. They
are circulated among the common people by thousands, and the
truth Is thus, for a time at least, hidden from the masses, who
not only believe that the most brilliant deeds have been per
formed; but that the hated 'foreign devils' have been annihilated
when they came into contact with the Chinese braves."

NEW YORK. Dec. 9^-Wu Ting Fan*,

an address this morning made a compari
son between Christianity and Confucian-
Ism, giving Instances in which Â»a tnougnt

sionary In China and the aggression or
Christian nations In the Orient wera out>-
Jected to his criticism. The address was
given In Carnegie ilusfc Hall under tne
auspices of the Society for Ethical Cul
ture. .
Wu Ting Fang outlined the tenets of
Confucianism and then argued that China
had a religion sufficient to her needs and
that missionaries v/ere in no rreat de
mand there. He said the predominating
faith of China waa that of Confucius,
laotism and Buddhism were for the dead,
while China had only one great religion
for the living. He said that at a Chinese
funeral priests of all religions officiated.
Minister Wu said that Confucius taught
that out of fellowship of man with, man
proceeded the five relations. They wÂ«rÂ»
those of sovereign and subject, parent and
child, elder and younger, husband and
wife, friend and friend.
"ThÂ» virtues," he add.ed, "are rlgrhtoons
ness, propriety, understanding and truth
fulness. The comparison of these virtues
with those taught by the founder oi the

"Confucianism Is the highest form ct
civilization and morality. The world is

of this Is the growing agnosticism of the

POISONED BEER
CAUSES DEATH
Three Thousand Persons in

Bpecial Dispatch to The CalL
NEW YORK. Dec. 10.â The Journal haa
the following from. London: Five addi
tional deaths from arsenical poisoning
were reported this week, bringing the
total number of victims of cheap adul
terated beer up to nearly one hundred.
These deaths have all taken place with'n
a radius of one hundred miles of Man
chester. The sufferers to date number
more than three thousand.
The beer scare reached London last
week. News of frightful Illness in tho
north of England from this latest epi
demic, with its long list of casualties,
has reached the metropolis. It was made
still more alarming last night by the re
port that disease had reached thl3 city.
This news cannot be confirmed up to
the present time, and medical men are
Inclined to attribute It to the scare in
Manchester and Liverpool; but no one
would be surprised at any time if an epi
demic ,of arsenical poisoning were to
reach London, for there are plenty of
beers and ales drunk here k\ which the
various corn sugars, made with sulphuric
acid, glucose, invert sugars, or by what
ever other name they may go. are made

DIES FROM COLD
AND EXPOSURE
"Mere Esther's" Career Comes
o a Miserable C ose
in Paris.
Special Cablo to The Call and New York Her
ald. Copyrisht, 1900. by the Herald Pub
lishing Company.
PARIS, Dec. 9.â Esther Chentouard,
aged 72, more commonly known as "Mere
Esther," was found dead from cold and
exposure in her miserable little attic in
the Rue Montreuil a few days ago.
In 1855 she became notorious from, her
association with Napoleon III. It Is a
little startling to find that Esther was
only a washerwoman, but in those days
the Emperor was, it seems,' very demo
cratic in his tastes, being under the
spell of socialistic dreams.
When storm and stress of adversity had
driven tnÂ© monarch's former favorite to
seek a livelihood she was too old to re
sume her former occupation. In happier
days she had been the faithful client of
all the chiromancers and fortune tellers
of Paris. She was herself an adept at
reading cards, so she proceeded to male
the rounds Oi. all laundries and for a few
sous tell the future to any washerwoman
willing to consult her.
In her moments of expanslvenesa Mere
Esther would relate the story of her Im
perial romance, and on great occasions
would bring out a weather-beaten da
guerreotype of a thin-faced man with a
waxed mustache. This was the likeness
ol Xapoleon III, which, she asserted, he
had given her with his own hands.

Struggle.
LONDON, Dec. 10.â "Mr. Kruger re
ceived a message from the Czar Friday
night." says the correspondent of the
Times at The Hague. "It was couched in
very friendly terms, but the fact that
its existence has been kept a close secret
is sufficient to indicate its author's in
tention to abstain from any active steps
toward Intervention. The Czar naturally
pleads, his illne?s as a sufficient excuse
for not interfering.
"Mr. Kruger when cheered by the
crowd on his return from the cathedral
to-day turned and roundly rebuked those
near him for such a desecration of the
Sabbath."
A dispatch from Johannesburg says the
town has been fenced round with barbed
wire to* prevent the inhabitants getting
food to tne Boers.
-Special dispatches from The Hague re
port the feeling there as one of alarm at
the prospect of an Ai.glo-German-Portu
guese combination which might snatcn
thÂ« Dutch seaboard or seize Java.

"that the Government will propose in the

"Queen Victoria and Great Britain," sa
luted "the alliance that has long existed
In treaties and has been confirmed in re
cent acts." ..'.... .
He said. the significance of the alliance
was "an assurance that our rights will be
respected and our dominions maintained."
Sir H. G. MacDonnell. the British Min
ister, in responding thanked the Govern
ment of King Carlos for the "friendly at
titude maintained with such correctness
toward Great Britain during the war In
South Africa, which has been warmly ap
prociated by the Government' of Queen
Victoria."
"The confirmation of the alliance which
unites us indissolubly." said the British
Minister, "is here in the presence of the
channel squadron. Ancient ties are drawn
closer by recent events. The British Gov

alliance may be ever maintained."
In conclusion he proposed "the prosper

SAN MATEO. Dec. 9.-What was un
doubtedly the most successful church af
fair ever held in this city closed last night
in Library Hall. Three sides of the hall
were occupied with the various booths
a thing of beauty in itself. One side
of the hall was entirely given over to the
flower display, which was in the form of
a rustic garden, where plants and cut
flowers were for. sale. A musical pro
gramme of more than usual excellence
waa provided for the first evening, and on
the second evening the farce "A Chafine
Dish Party," by John Kendridc Bangs
was rendered by local talent. The whole
affair reflects much credit on those in
charge and as a result of their earnest
work the Congregational Church will ben
efit both financially and socially. Rev.
William D. Kld.l. the pastor of the church
has only been in charge four months, but
in that time he has demonstrated his abil

SUCCESSFUL BAZAAR CLOSES,
NEW YORK, Dec 9.â The sixth annual
international eix-day bicycle race at
Madlson-squaro Garden was started at
midnight to-night before over 6000 people.
The race is held under the auspices of
the American Bicycle Racing Association,
and fourteen riders of international repu
tation began the 142-hour grind. They
represented as many, pairs, who will race
for the six days as teams. No man will
be allowed to ride on the track more than
twelve hours In any day. but the two men
in each team may relieve one another at
any time that suits them. At the end of
six days' racing $4000 in prizes will bÂ»s
distributed among the riders. Long be
fore S o'clock the crowds began arriving
at the garden, and by the time the pistol
eent the men off on their journey the
seats around the track and the great
space inside the rail were tilled. Tl:*
track this year Is banked very steep, and
is several feet higher at the outside than
that of last year.
The management faw fit to do this In
order to prevent "lcanng." which was
much In evidence at the previous races.
This will make the race much faster con
tinually, but probably will cause many
spills.
Following are the pairs counted into

in each pair being the one who started

provements are made.-- Their exterior
architecture, as Shown in the model, is in
the form of colonnades sweeping around
to the rear, with Ionic columns similar to
those that support the main portico. Be
hind these may- be seen a curved extension â¢
of the original White House walls. At the I
extremity of each colonnade wing will be'
shown a new entrance with as porto
cc.here facing squarely south. The wings
will be two stories in height, their col
umns extending to the top all around.
The new wings will be divided into va
rious apartments by temporary partitions,
which may be removed to attord a clear
space when the larger additions are built
to complete Mrs. Harrison's scheme of
utilizing each colonnade wing .as a pas
sageway, with' central rotunda, for reach-
Ing the greater adjuncts. The extension
on the west side of the new model is des
ignated as the "0010131 wing"; that on the
east the "public wing." In the latter and
extending from the- east room will be a
new reception room and ample office
apartments connecting with those now on
the second floor. Provision is also made
for a new circular state dining room sixty
feet in diameter in the west or "official
wing." On the second floor of this will
be provided five additional bedrooms.
In one hundred years the White House
has not been enlarged. At state functions
then John Adams received but thirty-two
Senators, whereas William McKinley
must be host to ninety. The apartments
in which were entertained but 105 Repre
sentatives In 1S0O must now hold 356 at
White House receptions. The Cabinet
now with eight members, then had but
five. The diplomatic corps was a small
handful of foreigners. Adams could en
tertain his entire Senate and Cabinet to
gether in the state dining room, built to
accommodate but forty guests. To-day
President McKinley must abandon this
well lighted room intended for state
feasts. He must spread his board in a
long, narrow corridor running east and
west through the center of the building.
This has no windows. Ladies in evening
dress cannot escape the chilling draughts
from doorways.
Necessary repairs and refurnishings of
the White House have brought the total
cost of the building since 1800 to about
$2,000,000.
In commemoration of the centennial of
the establishment of the nation's capital
in the District of Columbia handsome
medals have been struck off. On the ob
verstf are heads of Presidents John Adams
and William McKinley in relief, with the
dates 1800. 1900. The reverse bears repre
sentations of the capItols of the two peri
ods with an explanatory bar giving the
reason for being of the medal.

Passing of Or. W. Hemenway,
Well-Known Resident
of Winters.
WINTERS, Dec 9.â O. TV. Hemenway.
a well-known citizen of Winters, died this
morning at 8 o'clock. The cause of his
decease was an abscess In his hlj> re
sulting from disorders Induced by ex
posure and privation during the Civil
War. For some time previous t>> his
death, Mr. Hemenway had been staying
at the home of his brother. D. L. Hemen

spected In Winters. He came to this place
about fifteen years ago and since that
time had taken prominent part in many
public affairs. For four years he served
the people of Winters as Postmaster and
proved to be an able and efficient officer.
As a veteran of the Civil War he was al
ways an enthusiastic promoter of patri
otic, celebrations and It has often been
remarked that were it not for the efforts
of : George Hemenwas Winters would
make a very poor stowing on national
holidays.
Deceased was 58 years old and the
father of a large family. There were
three boys, two of whom are now at
home, where they have been caring for
their father and an Invalid brother. The
second son, Fred Hemenway. was called
home from Berkeley last week. Fred is a
sophomore in the University of California.
Walter.- the eldest son,i3 a prominent pho^
tographer of San Diego, and the younger
son has always remained at home to care
for his parents. Besides two daughters
who reside in this vicinity,* Mr. Hemen

"With all these results clearly Indicated
by the experiment as thus far tried." says
the Postmaster General, "rural free de
livery is plainly here to stay."
Of the twenty-one millions of people
scattered over one million square miles of
territory and to whose doors It Is the task
of the Government to arrange to carry
the mails through rural free delivery.
Postmaster General Smith says that by
the end of the current fiscal year one
sixth of them shall have beÂ«n served and
forty-three hundred routes In operation.
The net annual cost of a complete rural
free delivery system is estimated at $13,
7T2.224. On this point the report says:
"It will hardly be disputed that the
great result of carrying the postoffice to
every home. If it can be accomplished at
such comparatively small cost, is an ob
ject well worth undertaking:.
"This duty is emphasized and enforced
when we consider some other phases of
the postal question. In my lost annual
report it was shown that if a class of pub
lications which now under an evasion of
the purposes of the law pay the second
class rate of postage were really made to
pay the third class rate, as they ought
to do. it would bring an additional rev
enue to, the Government of $12,343 612 The
cost to the Government of this abuse is
almost exactly equivalent to the estimated
cost of broad national rural free delivery,
and If Jt is a question between favoring
a very limited number of publishers and
favoring twenty-one million of people
who live on the farms of the United
States there ought to be no hesitation In
serving the many rather than the few.
The abuse should be uprooted as a public
duty; national delivery service should be
undertaken as a public policy, and when
through the overthrow of the wrong, the
right can be established, without the
slightest additional burden the appeal be
comes irresistible."
Rural free delivers-, the report says, has
proved to be "the most salient, significant
and fax-reaching feature of postal devel
opment. Besides swelling the postal re
ceipts, the value of farms are enhanced
through the necessity for good roads and
the opportunity afforded the farmers to
keep abreast of the times by being put in
closer commux:lcation with the outside
world. The isolation and monotony which
have been the bane of country life are sen
sibly mitipated through the effect of rural
free delivery in placing the farm within
daily range of the intellectual and com
mercial activity of the world. The farmer
is also given cause to feel that he shares
the governmental advantages of ihe
townsman, which stimulates his IoyaJty
and patriotism.
The estimated postal revenue for the
fiscal year ending June 30. 1902, is $116,-
EBjMS. and the estimated exi>enditures
$121.27S,C4'.'. leaving a probable deficiency
of $4,634,o07.

It is rumored, according to the London
Engineer, that the discovery has been
made that some, if not all, of the Belle
isle's armor is only cast j iron and. not
wrought iron, as commonly assumed. The
fractures of certain plates were identical
with those of cast iron, and the late gun
nery experiment would therefore appear
to be of no value whatever. The ship was
originally built for,the Turkish navy, for
which' anything would be good enough,
and the' ship was subsequently turned
over to England for the sum of Jl.200,000,
and she adorned the navy list for over
â¢.twenty years under the false pretense of
being an armored coast defense ship. The

PERSONAL MENTION.
Senator Morgan's statement "I am ready to vote for
anything that will give us the canal" expresses the
popular sentiment. It is a display of the right spirit.
By that statement .Senator Morgan puts himself
in line with a great majority of the American people
and shows himself to be a practical statesman. The
desire of the country is to have the canal constructed
at once. There have been already too many and too
long delays in the enterprise. Since the President
and his advisers, after a full review of the subject and
with all the facts before them, believe the interests of
this country are fully conserved by the treaty, and the
construction of the canal can be best promoted by'its
adoption, why should the Senate interpose and'pre
vent the prompt undertaking .pf the work?
In reply Senator Morgan said: "I still stand by
that report. It is the duty of this Government to
abrogate that treaty, and if it were abrogated we could
build this canal as we pleased without any fear of
interference^ by Great Britain. Bur the administration
believes it best to ratify this treaty, which, while it
relieves the 6bjectionable features of the former treaty,
still recognizes We binding force of that convention.
I am, in short, ready to vote for anything that will
give us the canal." . V^-â
Having read that extract, the speaker turned to
Senator Morgan and asked him how he could recon
cile that report with his present stand in favor of rati
fying the Hay- Pauncefote treaty. ;
THE RIGHT SPIRIT.
SENATOR TELLER in opposing the Hay-
Pauncefote treaty providing for the construc
tion of the Nicaragua Canal quoted from a re
port submitted to the Senate in 1891 and signed by
Edmunds, Evarts, Frye and Morgan, declaring the
Clayton-Bulwer treaty to be obsolete, and saying:
"In view of all these conditions the committee is" of
the opinion the United States is at present under no
obligations measured either by the terms of the con
vention, the principles of public law or good. morals,
to restrain from promoting, .in any way that it may
deem best for its interests, the construction of this
canal, without regard to anything contained in the
convenion of 1850." ' . - -
If the expected award of three battleships to the
Union Iron Works and the proposal of the fruit
growers to form a gigantic combine to take in all the
fruit interests of the State under one roof be excepted,
local trade has been featureless during the, past week.
There has been a pronounced ad%-ance in mutton and
veal, owing to scarcity, and all livestock is reported
in limited supply at the high prices. The other staples
have strengthened or weakened in "ympathy with the
consumptive market? in the East, but (/ with the ex
ception of the advance of four cents per gallon in
wine, the fluctuations have been small. Farm products
as a rule continue quiet, as usual at this time of the
year, and merchandise is meeting with its usual sea
sonal demand. Otherwise there , is nothing new to
report, nor is anything expected until after the turn
of the year. : . .
The distributive trade of the country continues
fair, being dull in the Eastern Slate?, good "in the
Southern and Pacific States and improving in the
Northwest. The staples show little variation.- ''Iron
and steel, as before ; ;Tnentioncd, are less active as far
as new orders are concerned, but the different works
report future orders enough to keep them employed
for several months yet. so there is no anxretyon this
score. Hides. are easier, though the ranpe in prices
is still higher than it >vns se\/ral months ago. . Cotton
is unsettled, pending the forthcoming Government re
port, and the market is hampered by the failure of
manufactured goods to advance to a parity with the
raw material Wool is unusually dull, and sales are
less than half of those at the corresponding period-last
year. The shoe trade continues in good "tone, with
jobbers purchasing steadily at the recent advance.
Wheat has been unsettled during the week, improving
one day only to fall back the next A good feature
is the improving demand for flour, which has been
dull for some time.
â¢ â
THERE was not much character to business last
week, the markets being quiet and in the main j
featureless. The bank clearings of the country
gamed 15.3 per cent. over the same week in 1899, and
most of the leading cities showed an increase, the
exceptions being Chicago, Boston and Minneapolis.
]':ttsburg. which has lately been leading in these
ciearings, fell to a small increase of 5.2 per cent, indi- j
csting a slackening of! in the iron and steel trades.
The failures for the' week were 287, against 221 for
the same week last year.
There are other indications of the proximity of the
holiday dull spell, which comes along every year,
without regard to the intrinsic state of trade. Trading
in Wall street exhibited a further falling off, as the
public were no longer perceptible as buyers, and even
the professionals contracted their operations. The
tendency in prices was downward, particularly in the
industrials. The redeeming feature of the street is
the extensive and steady dem.ind for first-class bonds,
not for speculation but permanent, in vestment. The
January disbursements for dividends are expected to
be the largest ever known, and already there is a dis
position to reinvest the major part of these dividends.
This demand has resulted in a scarcity of gilt-edged
bonds and stoclcs. ani^the inquiry is now largely Tor
a second range of securities.
TRADE QUIETER AND FEATURELESS.
It will be seen that Uncle Sam has placed the super
vision of his farms in excellent hands. The work is
not only well done but is improving with the years.
It is a fat Christmas for farmers.
During the fiscal years 1897-1900 'our. total sales of do
mestic farm products to foreign countries aggregated
the enormous sum of $3.1?!S,000.000, an excess of $*30 ,000,000
over the preceding four-year period. The agricultural
exports of the United States 1 for the past fiscal year
amounted to $544,000,000. The rapid growth of our export
trade to the Orient in recent years- is most striking.
Five years ago our total shipments of domestic .mer
chandise to Asia and Oceania weje valued at $43,000,000,
] of which only ?9,7O0,O0O were agricultural. There has
Â¦ been a steady increase in each succeeding year, until in
1900 our export trade with the Orient amounted to $107,
,.000,000, of which $30,000,000 worth was farm produce.
Cheering reports arc made of an increasing public
interest in the movement for constructing better high
ways, and the department is giving all the help it can
to the good work. The office of experiment stations
reports considerable success attained in experimenting
v. ith gardens and small farms in Alaska, but says "it
is admitted Alaska can never become an agricultural
country." . Â« . â .
Finally the section of foreign markets shows us
what we can do in the way of finding consumers for
our, augmenting production by reporting:;
The total requests for worklnp plans at the close of
the' year exceeded 5O,OOO.(HV> acres,' of which two and a
half millions were private land. Personal examinations
were made of forty-eight tracts in fourteen States,
covering nearly POO.OCm) acres, plans were actually pre
pared for 200,009 aores and iiO ,00ft acres were put under
management. Tree-planting plans were made for fifty
nine applicants. ,
The division of forestry work announces that the
relations between the division and .the lumbermen
and'tree planters of the country have become closer
than ever before. , It is added:
Since Texas has made that much improvement- in
her range pasturage, surely other States and Terri
tories where cattle grazing is a large industry would
do well to follow he^ example. .
As a result of experiments in Texas, the grazing: of
pastures has been so much improved that; where three
years ago they were estimated as capable of supporting
one bteer to sixteen acres they will now maintain in
Rood condition one steer to eipht acres, a gain of 100 per
cent. â¢ "Â¦Â¦ - . â¢ > '. ". â¢
Reports of the drvrstons of "botany, seed' and' plant
irtroduction, vegetable physiology and pathology,
and pomology follow, but, contain no. salient features
of special interest.' Then comes this report' from the
division of agrostology, which is pertinent to the dis
cussion. of the question of lea'sing'the ranges:
.'Most satisfactory reports are received from California
as the result of the entomolopleaV work in the Introduc
tion of the insect v.-hlch fertilizes the Smyrna fig. In one
locality more than six tons of Smyrna flgrs have been
produced. The result .will-be '-to make America a grand
competitor In the fig. trade of the world's -markets.; An
Important parasite has_be.en_mtrÂ°duÂ£ed JQ..Pre.y.\ippp y^e
olive scale, so injurious to the olive growers of Califor
nia. From Natal a fungous disease has been introduced
by which injurious swarms of locusts have, been de
stroyed. Efforts have .been made to introduce European
parasites of the gypsy moth. . : 'â¢;'
, A summary of the report of the Secretary in charge
of the department will, on account of the variety of
the subjects referred to, appear very much like a series
of extracts from a scrap book. Thus it begins with,
an announcement that the Weather Bureau is. experi
menting in wireless telegraphy and that already mes
sages have been transmitted accurately over a distance
of sixty miles. Next follows the report of the bureau
of animal industry, showing the work done in the
way of inspecting meats offered for food and the pre
vention of diseases among all kinds of livestock. The
division of chemistry records a continuance of the
work of investigating food adulteration and an
nounces: "The meat of the horse has been examined
for the discovery of a method whereby it may be
detected when sold under another name" ; it is added:
"Very little of it^eerns to be sold in' .the United
States, whether under its own or any other name."
The division of entomology makes this 'statement,
which is of interest to our fruit-growers: : Â¦ / , /
FROM even the most cursory review of the an
nual report of the United States Department of
Agriculture the reader will perceive that the
range of the activities of that department of the Gov
ernment is'one of sufficient magnitude to tax the best
efforts of statesmen of the, highest capacity. In addi
tion to agriculture proper the department has in
charge many other fields of labor, varying from that
of the Weather. Bureau to that of the conservation of
forests, and including the inspection of foodstuffs and
the- promotion of highway improvement.

Things are being rapidly put into

given at the Ames home shortly after

which is to be done afterward at 'a local

every blessed son of woman in the audi

.Mrs. Joe Tobin had it all her own way
at the doll show. She examined each doll
carefully and every one she approved of
was immediately decorated with a blue
or red ribbon. Mrs. Tobin has opinions on
dress j and } her friends respect them. I
heard her gay at the show, "I don't like
that sleeve," and the doll with the sleeve
Mrs, Joe dUln't like got the pverlook. I
have been told that the fortunate dress
maker that enJoyB Mrs. Tobln's custom
is onto' one-half of the power that turns
out tfiose wondrous creations. The dress
maker.'Just does the mechanical part of
the' .work. Mrs. Tobin is the creative
mind that is accountable for the style
and happy touches that make a gown.
A clubman told me tne other day that
he hoped Mrs.' Tobin would never go to
Paris.
"She would be stared at to death," ho
said. "That long, graceful neck, her slim
waist and elegant figure â the form divine
â every French fashion plate proclaims to
be the proper thing. They would be writ
ing poems to her and it would be a safe
wager that before she was twenty-four
hours in the gay city they would have the
Tobln stays on the market."
I didn't think the dolls at this year's
show began to compare with those of
years gone by. I mean, of course, the
model dolls. But I do think that the sale
able dolls and the raffle dolls and the
doll-house were Just the cutest ever. And
didn't they do a land office business with
the dolls to be raffled. One of the pret
tiest dollsâ I .believe it was the Clarence
Master Mann bisque babyâ was won by
pretty Aileen Mclntosh. Alleen. who has

SOCIETY: THE SAD SIDE OF A BIT OF
DELICIOUS SCANDAL.
BY SALLY SHARP.
Municipal reform of one kind and*another is now
a demand in every part of the civilized world. An old
city like London is as eager in the work of improve
ment as a new city like Chicago. Indeed, throughout
the entire English-speaking world it has not yet been
determined what constitutes the true scope of munici
pal administration. In the newly organized govern
ment of London, with its twenty-eight "town coun
cils," it has been noted that some of them are so
socialistic/they will supply their boroughs with munici
pal lighting plants, waterworks, tramcars and houses
for workingmen; while others are so much opposed
to anything in the way of communism they will not
even maintain a free public library.
. With such radical differences of .opinion in the com
ponent-parts of a city whose population is virtually
of one race and whose mutual traditions run back for
a thousand years, it is clear there will be in the nature
of things wide divergences in the development of dif
ferent cities in California if each be permitted full
freedom of action. Consequently, whatever brings
the representatives of these diverging views together
for an exchange of ideas and a comparison of experi
ence* in the actual operation of laws and regulation*
will be of benefit to all. The League of Municipalities
has therefore a great work to do in the history of the
State and the public may be congratulated upon the
Kood start the league has made.
From such discussions much benefit may be ex
pected. The problems of municipal administration
are complex because the development of the mod
em city is processing along an infinite variety of
lines. City government is ho longer the simple thing
it was in the days of our grandfathers,- or even of our
fathers. Civilized man is demanding more and more
of his community. The kind of streets, sewers, parks,
schools and lighting that would have pleased men of
fifty years ago would now be denounced as relics of
barbarism. The gratification of each' need of civilized
life. at once raises another need, and municipal work
rot only augments in magnitude but increases in
'variety and scope. . V
It will be noted the programme is devoted exclu
sively to issues of practical administration, and that
many of the subjects are of immediate interest to' Cal
ifornia cities and towns. In each case, moreover, the
papers are to be read by men who have had experience
in the management of municipal affairs; and have a
personal knowledge of the subject with which they
deal. The result will be that the convention will be
something like an experience meeting. There will
be comparatively little in the way of theory and much
in the way of information derived from observation
and practice.
The programme includes a report of special com
rmttee on municipal accounting,' report of special com
n.ittee appointed to frame a street improvement act,
report of committee on legislation, consideration of
needed legislation in the interest of municipalities,
problems connected with street lighting, the practical
working of the new charter in San Francisco, oil for
streets and for fuel, hints for clerks, trees^for streets,
municipal concerts, water supply for San Francisco,
street cleaning by hand labor, tests to determine the
value of rock for street purposes; and it is announced
that at some time during the convention a representa
tive from each city will be called on to state, \vhat his
city has;done during the year. ' %b J\
CALIFORNIA municipalities will hold the third
annual. convention of their league at Pioneer
Hall in this city beginning December 12. The
convention promises to be one of the most important
locs-1 gatherings of the season and will doubtless be
well attended by representatives from all progressive
cities and towns in the State.

CALIFORNIA PACKED TO DOORS
BY THE FARCE "A BELL BOY"
He Suddenly Disappears From Seat
tle and Is Now Supposed
to Be In Vic
toria, i
Mrs. Lathrop, number three, pretty and
demure, arrived in this city yesterday
from Seattle bent on learning 1 the facts
in connection with the issuance of a war
rant for the arrest of her husband, James
SI. Lathrop, for bigamy. Mrs. Lathrop
married the man whom she claims 'as her
lawful husband about eight months ago.
He was an insurance agent and shortly
after they were married he took her to
Seattle, Intending to make that city his
home. On learning 1 that Lathrop had an
other wife, who, on learning of his du
plicity, had sworn to a complaint charging
him with bigamy, she demanded an ex
planation from her husband. He em
phatically denied that he was a bigamist,
but claimed that prior to meeting wife
number three he was given to understand
tliat his two previous wives had died. Dis
satisfied with his explanation, Mrs.
Lathrop communicated with her parents,
who live In this city, with the result that
she was told not to lose any time in
coming here. She arrived yesterday morn
ing and after consulting with her yarcnts
at once repaired to police headquarters.
Of Captain of Detectives Seymour the
heartbroken -woman demanded to know If
her husband was guilty of the crime
chuiged against him.
"If Â«he is," she declared, "I want to see
him punished." Â¦
Mra. Lathrop further said that before
leavlnp Seattle her husband promised to
fellow her on the next train bound for this
city. To her he vigorously, protested his
Innocence and declared that he would be
able to clear himself of the charge as
soon a* he reached San Francisco.
Afic-r being- shown the warrant, which
was issued at the request of wife number
two, v:ho Is now living at Salinas. Mrs.
Lathrop, presumably convinced of her
husband's perfidy, agreed to accompany
Detective George McMahon to the Sev
enteenth-street station. Oakland, and
point out her husband, who was expected
to arrive on the evening train. On the
arrival of the tr^ln Mrs. Lathrop, accom
panied by the detective and her sister,
went through the cars, but failed to find
the alleged bigamist. The police believe
that Lathrop, after seeing that his wife
was aboard the train, which was bound
for. this city, broke his promise to follow
her ana packing his grip quietly left Se
attle. It Is now believed that he is in Vic
toria, British' Columbia, and that he
crossed the border as soon as his wile
started on her trip to this city. She keenly
feels his failure to follow her, but believes
that he will be able to prove Wb Innocence
as soon as he is brought back and the
case against him Is heard.
Lathrop's defense Is that, while he was
married three times, he firmly believed
that two of his wives had died before he
married the present _pne.
Captain Seymour has communicated
with the authorities at Victoria, asking
them to arrest Lathrop and hold him,
pending the arrival of an Â¦ officer from
here. ,
Says. He Is Not a Bigamist
and Demands a Thorough
Investigation.

About five hundred worshipers assem
bled yesterday morning at a hall at 23
Hartford street and witnessed the Rev.
Father J. P. McQuaMe celebrate the nist
mass in the new parish of the Holy Re
deemer.
From a bare and coid looking hall the
place haul been transformed into a hand
some and cozy temporary cnapei througn
the efforts of the energetic young pas
tor. A handsome white altar had been
erected, the floor was occupied with plain
and yet substantial benches capable of
accommodating more than four hundred
people, and on" the wails were hung neut
pictures depicting the stages of the cross.
At 10 o'clock, the time appointed for the
celebration of the mass, every seat in th*
chapel had been taken and numbers were
standing in the aisles. His Grace Arch
bishop Riordan was present and was at
tended by the Rev. Father Mulligan.
During the sacrament the Rev. Father
Connolly arrived and took a seat in the
sanctuary.
The mass was said by the Rev. Father
McQuaide. who was invested in a violet
cope, the color prescribed by the church
for the second Sunday in Advent. . ThreÂ«Â».
lads acted as acolytes on the altar. Hia
Grace the Archbishop made an address.
He eaid in part:
You have a grand opportunity to build up a
great parish. We should not think of the present
but should look forward. We should feel that
when we are dead we shall leave behind a
great parish and a handsome church as a fruit
of our labors, that will stand ever as a last
ing monument. We should all of us do our
very best with this end in view. God requires
uÂ» to do our best and no more. The old parish
has grown too large, hence the organization of
this new one. The pastor of his flock should be
known not only as a priest that you eee every
Sunday at the altar, but as a man that is
well acquainted with you all and welcomed
Into every Catholic home as a true friend. I
think I have not been mistaken In the selec
tion of the priest that is to be your pastor. I
think that he has a large and loving heart and
that he is tilled with xeal for his work.
Tours will be known as the parish of the
Holy Redemeer. It is not named after a saint,
but after the king of saints, our Lord Jesus
Christ. Thin umall seed that is sown to-day
will. I hope, grow Into a large and vigorous
tree. I appeal to your seal and generosity. It
Is an easy task to accomplish anything when
we go at It In the right way. I hope that a
year from now you will be worshiping In a
new and handsome church that will be &
credit to our holy faith. â¢
The city Is rapidly growing. Parishes, small
a few years ago. are now large. We must make
preparations for our children. "When we pass
away to another world will it not be good for
the children to Â«ay: "Our parents ehowed rare
discretion and wonderful forethought in erect-
Ing these beautiful churches for us to wor
ship in?"
Our church Is steadfast and ' ts the same
one that was instituted by our blessed Lord
1900 years ago. Other religions may hare
changes, but ours has stood steadfast. There
fore we should bow down In gratitude that we
are members of the faith and take pride . In
our possession. Â¦ ; ,

Parishioners Worship in the
Temporary Chapel of
Holj Redeemer.
FIRST SERVICE IS
LARGELY ATTENDED
Rev. Michael Smith, father superior of
the Paulist order on this coast, visited
the City and County Alnoshouse yester
day morning at 8 o'clock and celebrated
high mass for the benefit of the several
hundred inmates of that institution. It
was the most important the Almshouse
chapel has known for several years. A.
large number of San Francisco and Oak
land people went out to hear Father
Smith and a choir from the city eave
their services. Father Smith said In
part:
We are now, as you are very - well aware,
dear brethren, in that season of preparation
which we call Advent, and our minds are
directed by the holy church during these four
weeks to the coming â¢ of our Lord â not simply
to his one coming, but to all his comings. That
is to say, we devoutly recall how the Omnipo
tent God, he who is the infinite, put himself
within bounds; We recall hov he who is the
eternal, the ancient. of days, for us men and
for our salvation, became a child of time: how
he, who is all blessed, whom there Is no change
or shadow of vicissitude, for our sake* came In
our suffering humanity. So the holy church
In these few weeks ! wishes us to dwell over
that blessed coming, of Jesus Christ, son of
God, son of Mary, who, for us i and for our
Balvation, came down to our natures and lived
in this. world wtth us.
We are also to recall another coming, when
this same son of God and son of Mary, from
the clouds of Heaven Â¦with pomp and majesty,
preceded and accompanied and followed by mlU
lions of angels, shall oome to ludge.the quick
and the dead. That, too, the holy church wants
us to look forward to.'
There are other comings:- the coming of our
blessed Bavior who has given himself to us In
the sacrament. by which we can corns to him;
ho comes to us in the peace of devotion; and he
dwell* with us so that we may say, : "My be-
Joved" to him and he to us.
After . the . service* Superintendent ' and
Mrs. Reddy save I an elaborate breakfast
for Father Smith and a number of. other
High Mass at Almshouse.
The attributes of God which are moat fully
displayed In' his works are his power and his
holiness. His greatest work In the order of
grace 'was the incarnation of his divine eon.
and for this he made fitting preparation by
choosing out a human being who should be the
Instrument of his. visible presence, the free
agent and co-operator In his design. This was
the Virgin Mary. _â¢*
Quite outside the authority of his church,
which proclaims the truth that Mary was con
ceived sinless, there are reasons of fitness for
It. which appeal to our minds. God fian owe
nothing to any of his creations, but he does
owe it to himself, that his agents, his repre
sentatives should be possessed of those quali
ties of mind and body that will enable them
to discharge his work and thereof becomingly.
God owed It to his own power that there
should be one specimen at least of his primal
beneficence In creating mankind. Otherwise we
should be obliged to eay that the malice of the
evil one had thwarted and spoiled his plan.
God owes It to his own holiness that she from
whom he was to derive his second beinjt should
be sinless. "For what convention hath Christ
with Belial, or what part hath light with dark
ness."
The preacher then sketched the growth of
the t>ellef In the church which culminated in a
dogmatic declaration In 1S34 by Plus IX. Ha
urged his hearers to be proud of this privilege
of their heavenly mother and endeavor to imi
tate her purity.
The Rev. Father M: P. Smith, father
superior of the Paulist order in. this city,
preached the sermon at the 11 o'clock
mass at the Holy Cress Church yester
day. The reverend father addressed the

GOLF EXPERTS VISIT
FORT BAKER COURSE
Horace and Harry Rawlins Show
Sausalito Golfers How to Drive'
and Approach.
The final round of the ladles' champion
ship of the Sausalito Golf Club was
played on Saturday afternoon between
Miss Winifred Mason and Miss Mabel
Mason, and was won by the former, who
is regarded as the strongest lady golfer
on the Fort Baker links. The winning
couple in the semi-final round of the
mixed foursomes played yesterday morn
ing were Miss Grace Martin and W. F.
Horn, who defeated Miss Winifred Mason
and R. \V. Mason, 1 up. The winninsr
couple played in the afternoon against
Miss Mabel Mason and J. M. Kllgarlf, the
match ending In a tie.
.Shortly after 2 o'clock in the afternoon
Horace and Harry Kawlins, the two pro
fessionals of the Oakland Gqlf Club, ar
rived at the Fort Baker links and at once
began play. They were followed by an
admiring crowd of spectators, who were
especially struck with the length of the
experts' drives and the accuracy of their
approach shots. The clay "greens," how
ever, bothered the visitors considerably,
as they vary grreatly in speed, while all
the greens on the Oakland links are tuft
ed. In many cases brilliant approaches,
which would have laid the ball dead;near
the hole on a tufted green, rolled off on
the farther side. Harry Rawlins played
better than his more famous brother,
Horace, making his two rounds In 46, 46,
while Horace's scores were 52 and .48. Two
or three balls were lost in the matted
grass, others being dropped as near as
possible to tho spots where they were sup
posed to be. The spectators were delight
ed with the exhibition, and greeted the
experts with a hearty round of applause
at the conclusion of the second round.
Upon consultation with the brothers, a
bogey of 44 was established for the course.

NEW YORK, Dec 10.â Representatives
from commercial interests In various sec
tions cf the country, principally from the
Pacific Coast, Western and Eastern
States, will appear before the Interstate
Commerce Commission in Washington to
day at a hearing to consider the matter
of transcontinental rates and the conces
sions in such rates now being sought by
Middle Western Jobbers, chiefly grocery
and hardware firms.
For some time past stronar .efforts have
been made by these Interests and several
conferences with the railroads have been
held, to have the latter adopt a system
of graded rates. If these efforts are suc
cessful Pacific Coast rates, under the plan
proposed, -would always be higher from
New York and to San Francisco than to
San Francisco from any point west of
New York. Eastern jobbing interests aro
naturally working hard to prevent tha
establishment of such a system.
They will be represented at the hear
ing to-day and J. Si. Langley of the Mer
chants' Association will appear In behalf
of the New York shipping interests, rep
resented by the members of that organi
zation.
The western people are advocating
graded rates â that Is. If a rate from New
York to San Francisco happens to be It
per 100 pounds, they contend that the rate
from Plttsburg on the same gonda should
be approximately 90 cents; from Chicago
SO cents: from the Mississippi River 7".

There is some talk of giving the compa
nies some work in the near future aside
from the ordinary evolution of the drill
room. This, it is said, will Include guard
mount outside of the armory building,
field exerdne, street parades by moon
light and other exercises that will teach
the new men the art of war in a practical
manner.
The court-martial that is to try Captain
Firman A. NIppert of Company F. First
Regiment, upon a charge of having made
a false parade report will convene to-mor
row night in the regimental armory, on
Page street. The accused has engaged
two attorneys to represent him, and It Is
understood the defense will be on tech
nical grounds:
In view of the promises that have been
made to place the First Infantry Regi
ment in good condition after the holiday
season is over It is probable that the nrBt
irtep to be taken will be to recruit the
companies up to a number considerably in
excess of the minimum of organization,
which is fifty, and then arouse a spirit of
enthusiasm from the field oSIcers down.
One of the former officers of the regiment,
now on the retired list, speaking a few
days since of the apathy in- the guard in
this city fct this time, said: -
"The reason that the First Regiment is
not now what it once was Is because it
has no rival organization here. If, as in
the days of a few years since, there were
two or more regiments located here there
would now be that same good natured riv
alry that existed then, for each regiment
would seek to excel the other in appear
ance, drill and so on. Now there lsnonÂ«
of that spirit. The boys have nothing to
be superior to, and the officers and mem
bers Beem to be content with going
through what has to be done in the, most
perfunctory' manner. A good, wide-awake
and up-to-date regiment j Is what we
need." - Â¦_. -â¢'.
Lieutenant Colonel T. J. Hay, assistant
adjutant general of the Third Brigade, re
cently acted as Inspector of the brigade
In the absence of Major Varney Oasklll,
who was In Paris. The acting inspector
did not gain a very exalted opinion of the
brigade as a result of the inspection, for
in his report he will say that he did not
find it in the condition that it ought to
have been In. He will recommend that
several of the companies that are not up
to the standard bo disbanded.
Several years ago there existed in this
State an organization composed of officers
of the eeveral branches of the National
Guard, which met shortly before each
session of the Legislature and discussed
measures looking toward the betterment
of the guard. This organization has not
met for several years, but Major General
Dickinson in an unofficial way has sug
gested that it should meet again this year
and take some steps to Induce legislation
to the end that the guard may in the
near future be placed in such condition as
will make it a credit to the State, which
every year pay& a good sum to maintain
it. Such a meeting has been called for
the 15th lnst. .it division headquarters.

DENVER, Dec 9.â A requisition for
Clinton Oxman. accused of swindling J.
Mayer Greene In Valparaiso, Ind., of
$10,000, was refused b'y Governor Thomas
yesterday. Attorney General Campbell,
in passing upon the requisition sent by
Governor Mount of Indiana, called atten
tion to the refusal of the Government to
extradite ex-Governor Taylor on the de
mand of the Governor of Kentucky when
it was proposed to try Taylor in connec
tion with the murder of William Goebel
in the State House yard at Frankfort.
Mr. Campbell advised the Governor that
Governor Mount had established a dan
gerous precedent In refusing requisition
papers for an indicted prisoner. He said
that the Hoosler Governor's conduct in
the Taylor case was a menace to society,
but that even though he should continue
to carry it out Governors of other States
should not follow any such rule even when
the Governor of Indiana asked them for
a prisoner.
Governor Thomas, however, seemed to
take the first and not the last part of tne
opinion to heart, for on a trifling techni
cality he refused the requisition, saying
that it was not in regular form.

Governor Thomas had a consultation with
Mr."" Campbell and then announced that
the papers were not made out in techni

with the attitude of Governor Mount of
Indiana in refusing to honor Governor

It is now generally agreed by the best
critics that certain of the plays Included
in the standard editions of Shakespeare
are not wholly his, but are partly tho
work of other dramatists, some of whom
can be Identified. The chief plays in this
class are "Titus Andronicus," the three
parts of "Henry VI," "The Taming of
the Shrew." "Timon of Athens," "Peri
cles" and "Henry VIII." To these may be
added "The Two Noble Kinsmen." which
is found In several of the editions.
Dowden aptly calls the first period of
Shakespeare's dramatic career "In tho
Workshop." Genius though he was, he
had to learn his art like inferior men. He
appears to have begun with work of a
comparatively low grade â such as might
be intrusted to an apprentice in dramatic
workmanshipâ the "fixing up" of plays
not his own that had their "run" but
might get a new lease of life on the
boards by partial reconstruction-
One of the first of these plays was
probably "Titus Andronlcus," which some
critics omit from the list of his work-*.
If he had anything to do with It (which is
probable from the fact that It Is at
tributed to him by writers of the time,
and is Included in thÂ« folio of 1623, which
was compiled by two of his brother aci
ors and personal friends). It is quite cer
tain that it was only In this 'prentice way.
As early as 1687 Edward Ravenscroft,
in the preface of his adaptation of the
play, quotes an early tradition that "Ti
tus Andronicus" was th< work of "a pri
vate author" and received from Shakes
peare "only some master touches to one
or two of the principal parts or charac
ters." A few editors and critics believe
that Shakespeare was the sole author. If
he, was the play must bÂ« several years
earlier than any other of his works and
must have been written under the in
fluence of the "blood and thunder" school
of tragedy, then happily in its last days,
which Shakespeare ridicules in the "Mid
summer Night's Dream," itself one of his
early plays. As Dowden puts it. "If It is
of Shakespearean authorship It may be
viewed as representing the period of
crude and violfent youth, before he -had
found his true self." l
Those who accept it as entirely his lay
much stress on the fact that It is Includ
ed in Francis Meres' list (OS) of twelve
plays by Shakespeare; but as it had been
revised by him it might be known In the
theater as "Shakespeare's Titus Andron
icus" to distinguish It from the original
drama, and eight or nine years later,
when the original was forgotten, the re-
Vision might come to be generally re
garded as an early production of the re
viser himself. ,
Another play whicn is almost unani
mously believed to have been only re
vised or retouched by Shakespeare in his
'prentice days is "I Jlenry VI." Some
critics think that the only part of It which
can confidently be ascribed to him Is the
Temple Garden scene (li., 4), where Som
erset and Plantagenet pluck the red and
white roses. Others add the scene (v.. 3. 45.
fol.), where Suffolk wooes Margaret. A.
few believe that he wrote the whole or the
greater part of the play.
The question of tne authorship of "II
and III Henry VI," is more complicated,
and to give even an outline of the various
attempts to answer it would be Impossible
here. Suffice it to say that these plays
are evidently founded upon two earlier
plays. ,ln which Shakespeare may or may
not have had a hand and that his share
in the revised versions, though apparent
ly much greater than in "I Henry VI,"
is not easily determined. (For a concise
summary of the discussion I may refer
the reader to my edition of "II Henry
VI." pages 9-15. or to Dowden's "Shakes
peare s Primer, pages 74-7S. a book which
every student in these Record courses
should own.)
"The Taming of the Shrew" is another
and later instance of an old and anony
mous play, "The Taming: of the Shrew,"
which Shakespeare revised, giving his
attention mainly to the characters of
Katharine and Petruchio. The old play
had previously been modified by an un
known writer. As the history of this
Elay was fully treated In last year's
takespeare course, I need not dwell
upon it here. Â¦Â«.
"Timon of Athens" is Shakespeare's
only '*\ part, as the critics almost unan
lmousiy agree, though they differ In their
explanations of the divided authorship.
Knight, the Cambridge editors and a few
others believe that the dramatist worked
over an earlier play, parts of which, for
some reason or other, he retained â¢with
slight alteration. On the other hand, the
majority of editors, Including Gollancz
and Herford, the very latest, regard it aa
an original work of Shakespeare's, which
he laid aside or left unfinished, and which
Â¦was completed by an Inferior writer.
Ti.ere are difficulties In either theory, but
the latter is by far the more probable.
There is little difficulty In separating
Shakespeare's part of "Timon" from that
of the other writer, and there would be
less or none were it not that in somo
scenes we have the work of the two hands
mixed, the finisher of the play having at
tempted to rewrite portions of It, but
blending more or less of the original gold
with his own baser metal. "We can se3
that the gold is there, but cannot sepa
rate It from the alloy. Mr. F. G. Fleay
has edited what he believes to be Shakes
peare's "Timon" for the New Shakes
peare Society, and it may be found in
their "Transactions" for 1874. pages 131-191 :
but. as Dr. Furnivall suggests. It seems
better on the whole to print the entire
play, putting the non-Shakespearean
parts In smaller type, so that the reader
or student may ludtre for himself whether
anything in these portions is Shakes
peare's or not. I have adopted this
course In my edition of the play.
"Pericles" la one of the standing enis:
mas of Shakespearean criticism, though
recent investigation has. In my opinion,
gone far toward solving It. One editor
Jocosely compares his perplexity concern
ing It to that oX the worthy man -who
said to his wife: "I hear so much about
the age of pericles. My dear, what are
pericles?"
That Shakespeare did not write tho
whole of the play Is now quite unanimous
ly conceded; that he did write a part of
it is almost as generally agreed. All crit
ics see at least two hands in the composi
tion; some believe that they recognize*
three.
We may safely say that the first two
acts are not Shakespeare's, and that the
offensive prose scenes in act IV and the
Cower matter are the work of some in
ferior writer, and perhaps not the same
who wrote the first two acts.
It Is to be noted that the last three acs
(omitlng the portions Just mentioned)
form a complete story of drama in them
selvesâan artistic whole, not unworthy
of Shakespeare In his maturest period.
This has been separated and edited by Mr.
Fleay for the New Shakespeare Society,
and is printed under the title of "The
Birth and Life of Marina" in the "Trans
actions" for 1874. pages 211-241.
The main theories concerning the his
tory of "Pericles" as It stands are much
like those concerning "Timon." Some
critics suppose that the first two acts aro
part of an earlier play by another author,
and that Shakespeare rewrote, or rather
partially rewrote, this for hla own theater
in London. According to this view he al
lowed the opening acts of the original to
stand, and was content to give all his
labor to the latter part of It. The prose
scenes In act IV may have been Inserted
subsequently to suit the popular taste or
for some "stage" reason past our finding
out at this late day.
Another theory, so Improbable that It la
hardly worth mentioning. Is that the play
was written by Shakespeare and some
other dramatist Â¦who Â¦worked in partner
ship, or collaboration, a common practica
with the playwrights of that period. The
double authorship of other playsâ
"Timon," "Henry VIII" and "The Two
Noble Kinsmen" â has sometimes been ex
plained in the same way.
But there Is no external evidenea what
ever that Shakespeare ever entered Into
any such literary partnership, and. In ray
opinion, the internal evidence of all these
plays Is decidedly against the theory.
This Is particularly true of "Pericles."
To say nothing of reasons drawn from the
dramatic structure of the play, the ques
tion is settled, to my thinking, by metri
cal considerations alone. Shakespeare
was eminently a metrlst. He was born
with the metrical or rythmleal ear. His*
earliest work, whether we suppose It to be
"Venus and Adonis" or some of the son
nets or plays like "Love's Labor's Lost"
and "The Two Gentlemen of Verona."
shows thlss artistic metrical skill, which
is invariablyâ naturally and of necessity
combined with extreme sensitiveness to
metrical Imperfections In others. Â»lf
Shakespeare wrote "Pericles'* or any
other play In conjunction with another
author he must of course have read what
his partner wrote, and ft Is absolutely In
conceivable that he could have tolerated
in the joint production such wretched
verse as we find In "Pericles" or "Tl
mon." I doubt whether he would have
consented to collaborate with such a man.
but if he did he would have Insisted upon
being allowed to put his partner's harsh
and halting lines into better shape. I can
Imagine him, after reading some of thte
verse â If verae It can be calledâ saying to
the author, as he made Hotspur say of
the "ballad-mongers":
"I bad rather hear a brazen caxutick turn'd.
Or a dry wheel prate on the axletree:
And that would set my teeth nothing on edge.
Nothing so much as [poetry !â¢"*Â« this]:
*Tls like tbe forced salt of a shuffling nag."
I may add what he makes Rosalind say
In criticism of Orlando's love verses:
"Cellaâ Didst thou hear these vÂ«rseÂ»T
"Rosalind â Oh. yea, I heard them all. an<i
more, too, for some of them had In them more
feet than the verses would bear.
"Cellaâ That'* no matter; the feet mlffht bear
"Rosalind â Ay. but thÂ» feet wnÂ» lame an-l
could not bear themselves without the verse,
and therefore stood lamely in the verse."
And Touchstone compares the Jingling
rhymes to "the right butterwoman's rank
to market" â the mere Jogtrot of verse â
and again he calls it "the very false gal
lop of verse." These and other pa3.sage9
that I might quote Bhow Shakespeare's
critical way of looking at versification.
The rhymes of the clowns In the "Mid
summer Night's Dream" are better versa
than much In "Pericles" and "Tlroon."
The feet are at least all right in the inter
lude of the Athenian artisans, the bur
lesque features being the excess of alliter
ation, the absurd figures, and other
rhetorical extravagances. Imperfect rhy
thm the poet seems to have considered
too bad ever for Bottom and his crew.
Can we suppose that he could have en
dured it In a dramatic composition of
which he was to be known as joint au
thor?

among those who took part in the inter

have served the church during Its life
time. During the morning services tiio
Rev. George Mooar, D. D., who was the
tlrst pastor, occupying the pulpi* from
1SC1 to 1S72, preached a discourse, partly
reminiscent and partly theological. Rev.
Charles R. Brown, the present pastor, 'n
troduced the aged clergyman, who has
lived to witness the great grovrth from
the little band of worshipers ae came
forty years ago to minister unto.
The anniversary exercises attracted
many members who had been affiliated
with the church for years past. There
waa a special programme of muilc.
Immediately after the conclusion of the
mornii.g services the Sunday school ex

celebration was opened by Superintendent

With his skull fractured and his no-?e
broken Antone Galindo, a tamale ped
dler, was taken to th* Receiving Hospi
tal to-night, his condition being the re
eult of a brawl ax the corner of Fourth
and Clay streets. Tom Clear, a peddler,
according to statements made to the no-
lice, struck Galindo a blow in the face,
breaking his nose and knockins him
down. The fractured skull was caused by
his striklnc on the- back of his heiid on
the cement sidewalk.
The skull was fractured at the base of
the brain and Gahndo was unconscious
and dying when taken to the hospital.
The affray occurred a.t Q:30 o'clock. John
Wright, who resides across the street and
whose son witnessed the affair, sent for
the police and the injured man was takea
to the City Hall. Captain Petersen saw
that the prisoner required surgical atten
tion and had him sent post-haste to the
hospital.
From the information gathered by Chtef
of Police Hodgklns Detectives Kyte and
Hamerton anu several policemen, Gailn
do's attempt to abduei Cornice Cunning
ham, the 8-year-old aauphter of Mrs. j.
Cunningham, who resides at ~oo~i 1'ourth
street, was the cause of the assault.
Mrs. Cunningham furnishes the following
story:
"I had been calling on Mrs. Lester, who
lives in the rear of the house Gallndo was
in. One of my children, Bernlce, was
playing on the sidewalk and 1 was inside
talking to Mrs. Lester, when a child ran
in and said Gallndo had picked up Bernice
and was walking away with her. 1 ran
out and saw Gaiindo with Bernice in his
arms. I grabbed her away from him. say
ing 'What are you doing with my child?"
"He replied, thickly, T was getting her
away from the hoodlums around here.'
"But there was nobody round the corner
and 1 did not understand what he meant
by such an answer. I took the girl, went
back and got my other child and returned
to my own home across the fetreet. I
heard nothing more about the matter un
til a few minutes after I got home. Some
one told me Galindo had been hurt and
that he had tried to use a knife. I did
not see anything of any fight. It is possi
ble that the trouble 1 had with him about
the child may have led to this other dlf-
iiculty."
Mrs. Lester corroborated Mrs. Cunning
ham's statement, but she saw nothing of
the difficulty.
George Wright, son of the man who
called the police, told the officers that
Galindo had made some remarks to Tom
Clear at the street corner, that Clear had
told Galindo to move on and they had a
quarrel, during which Clear knocked the
tamale man down.
Wright told the police that after knock-
Ing down Galindo, Clear and a companion
carried the injured man across the street,
leaving him in a vacant lot. The lad also
declared that Mrs. Cunningham had wit
nessed the assault and had upbraided
Clear for Etriking Galindo.
Mrs. Cunningham denied that she *aw

The following are the seasonal rainfalls to
date as compared with those of the same date
last season, and rainfall In last twenty-four
hours:
There Is a sentiment In certain quarters
against Mr. Gompers. The objection
"seems to be on account of his ideas con
cerning socialism. It is said he' believes
in the fundamental principles of socialism,
but is conservative in that he does not
think the time is ripe to force the doc
trines of socialism to an issue. John Dun
can, now second vice president, holds the
key to the situation. He Is the undoubted
choice of the opposition and is moreover
extremely popular and universally regard
ed as a strong manâ one of the strongest
.in the entire labor movement. If he al
lows the use of his name it will mean a
great light, with considerable possibilities
for the defeat of Gompers.
Then It offers resolutions that steps be
taken to inculcate this idea Into the minds
of workingmen, that the various â¢ unions
unite their votes to that end and finally
provides that the officers of the conven
tion call an independent conference of the
members of organized labor to consider
the question of how best to unite to secure
the desired legislation. It Is understood
that the supporters of the resolution will
urge that a policy of referendum be used
in the Federation for the submission, ot
questions to the entire membership of the
organization, the votes- to be returnable
before the next convention. Upon this a
hard fight will be waged. The convention
will be compelled to put itself on record
one way or the other, and the Socialists
are making great claims as to their
strength. ;
After a long preamble relating to the
unfairness of, the present system of leg
islation, which it is claimed puts all the
power In the hands of the enemies of or
ganized labor, and the necessity for the
initiative and referendum, it declares the
folly of the Federation In dividing its vote
on election day, and urges the members
of organized labor to stand together at
the ballot-box to secure direct , legislation.
LOUISVILLE. Dec. 9.â The most bitter
*flght in the history of the American Fed
eration of Labor Is to be made this week
on the question of uniting the entire 1,500,
000 votes of the organization for the bene
fit of the Socialist Democratic party. A
resolution with this in view is now in tho
hands of the resolutions committee.

DIVISION AMONG
FORCES OF LABOR
A committee consisting of Miss Bessie
Collins, Miss Abbie Hayes and Mrs. Hall
was appointed to arrange for the meeting

of the Young Women's Institute. Miss
Malloy and others are Interesting: them
selves In securing the signatures of wo
men to a pledge t that they will refrain
from patronizing millinery stores after 6
o'clock in the evening.
.It is the intention of the milliners to
meet again Sunday, December %3,~~ at 2
o'clock, in Red Men's Hall, to consider the
results of the employers' meeting.
Resolved, That we suspend further action un
til two weeks from to-day, to give our em
ployers opportunity to meet and take action in
the matter; and that we place Red Men's Hall
at the disposal of the employers Sunday. De
cember 16, from 3 to 4:30 p. m.
Whereas, It appears that many of our em
ployers are of the opinion that they can bring
about an amicable settlement of the question
at issue In our effort to secure shorter hours
of labor; therefore, be it
The milliners who are trying to get a
shorter workday have decided to try the
expedient of letting their employers state
what concessions they are willing to
make. At their meeting yesterday at
Red Men's Hall the following resolution
was adopted:
prle.tors May Grant -Demands

Inspector General Breckinridge Says
They Help to Promote the Mor
als of the Men.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9.-A report from
General J. C. Breckinridge, inspector
general, U. S. A., to the lieutenant gen
eral commanding the army, urges an in
crease of the Inspector general's depart
ment In order to put it on a more efficient
basis, and also calls attention to the un
certain and hampering effects of detailed
instead of permanent officers in that de
partment. , Â«
A lengthy chapter of the report is . de
voted to conditions in the Philippines, set
ting forth the initial lack of a properly
organized syestem of land transportation
in the islands and scarcity of well-equip
ped pack trains and tne improvements ef
fected in these conditions.
"The evolution of the army ration" is
dwelt upon at some length. General
Breckinridge also touches upon the suc
cess which sugar and sweets have at
tained as a part of the soldiers' food, es
pecially in the tropics. The success that
has attended the establishment of post
exchanges at garrisons throughout the
country is noted, and it Is stated that
the concensus of opinion in the army gen
erally is that the present exchange pro
mo e i ?t- tn ? mora ls. temperance, discipline
an u i? health of the men as compared
with the former regime, bales of liquor
are confined to soft drinks, beer and light
winesâ a radical departure from the old
system, when whisky was one of the ar
ticles issued by the subsistence depart
ment.' -

Isaac W. Stanley, proprietor of Stan
ley's Grotto, Market and Turk streets,
died yesterday morning at his residence,
237 Turk street, and his body was removed
to the Morgue to await the result of an
Investigation.
Stanley went home Wednesday evening
about 6 o'clock and while ascending the
stairs fell backward to the bottom. Mrs.
Stanley and the servant girl, Lottie Ed
wards, were In a rear room at the time
and heard the noise of the fall.
"What is that?" exclaimed Mrs. Stan
ley, and the girl replied that It was some
one dumping coal next door.
In a minute or so they heard groans,
and going to the top of the stairs saw
Stanley lying in a heap at thÂ© bottom.
They helped him upstairs and put him to
bed. Drs. J. M. Williamson and M. B.
Estcs were sent for, and they found that
Stanley's left arm was broken In three
places and there was a gash on the left
side of his head. Everything was done for
him, but he got worse and had to be tied
down in his bed till he finally succumbed.
Dr. T. B. W. Leland made an autopsy
on the body and found that death was
caused by delirium tremens. Dr. Leland
says that in the case of a heavy drinker
a sudden shock will bring on delirium.
The injuries received would not have
caused death. The body was afterward
taken to 237 Turk street.

CAUSES HIS DEATH
Police Officer J. Xyhan of the Seven
teenth-street station found himself in a
tight place at 5 o'clock yesterday after
noon while making an arrest of a man
named Richard Meehan at Twenty-second
and Chattanooga streets. At the time
mentioned a row started between a few
of the warm-belt roughs and the officer
placed Meehan under arrest for disturbing
the peace.
Xyhan had no sooner arrested his man
than he was set upon by the gang and an
attempt was made to take the prisoner
away. In this the women of the neighbor
hood took part against the officer and
closed in on him in such a manner as to
prevent him from drawing his club. In
the rough and tumble fight that followed
Nyhan drew his pistol, which was seized
by Meehan and discharged. This had the
effect of scattering the crowd and Meehan
was subdued.
Just at this time, acting on information
sent to the Seventeenth-street station.
Officers Redmond and Xorton arrived with
the patrol wagon and conveyed Meehan to
the station, where he was charged with
battery and disturbing the peace. Among
the crowd who made themselves conspicu
ous In battering the officer were two
Lynch brothers; who made good their es
cape. Xyhan's head was considerably cut
and bruised in the rough handling which
he received at the hands of the gang.

WASmXGTONV Dec 9.-The Senate
*ill continue to give Its attention to the
"^-fauncefote treaty and the ship-sub
sidy bill during the present week, taking
up .irst one and then tho other as may
suit the convenience of those who may
wish to speak on. the two measures. Dur
iny the last session of. Congress the Nic
araguan canal bill was made the special
crder of business for Monday next, but
the establishment of the ship bill as the
regular order will have the effect of dis
placing the canal bill, preference belns
given under the rules of the Senate to
a regular order/over a special order. It
is understood that Senator Morgan, who
has charge of the canal b!U, will not press
that measure until the treaty for the ab
rogation of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty is
disposed of. On this account the friends
of the. ship bill do not apprehend that he
will make any opposition to the continu
ance of the consideration of that measure.
He has, indeed, said that he would be
content to allow his bill to follow closely
in the wake of the ship bill.
Three or four Senate speeches are prom
ised in opposition to the subsidy bill, and
it Is expected that most. If not all of
those already in sight, will be made dur
ing this week. . Among those who proba
bly will speak on the subject are Senators
Clay,- Vest and Berry, all of whom op
pose the bill. Senator Vest is an especial
advocate of free ships.
There are differences of opinion as to
what effect the taking of a vote on the
fortification amendment to the treaty will
have upon the time of disposing of that
instrument, but a majority of the Sen
ators express the opinion that the vote
upon the treaty itself will follow very
soon after, the vote upon the amendment.
The indications are that the amendment
will be adopted, and, as thus amended,
the treaty will be ratified. Opponents of
the treaty will offer other amendments,
but they do not count upon having them,
favorably acted upon.
The Senate will not sit Wednesday, on
account of the centennial celebration of
the establishment of the seat of Govern
ment at Washington, and there is a possi
bility of adjournment from Thursday un
til Monday of next week.
PROGRAMME IN THE HOUSE.
Brewing Interests Working for
Further Decrease of Beer Tax.
WASHINGTON, , Dec. Â¦ 9. â The pro
gramme in the House for the coming
week contemplates the consideration and
passage ' of the* legislative, executive M and
judicial appropriation bill and the bill for
the reduction of the war revenue taxes.
Wednesday will be dies -non, so far as
legislation is concerned, as on that day
the exercises in; connection with the cen
tennial celebration of the removal of the
seat of "Government to. Washington will
be held in the House. The legislative ap
propriation - bill Is not. expected to Â¦ con
sume more than two days at. most â prob
ably only oneâ and the. leaders expect
that the remainder; of the week will suf
fice to pass 'the war revenue reduction
act. Â¦Â¦ " v --' Â¦ 'Â¦Â¦' â¢ '*"â¢ Â¦ Â¦â¢Â¦-â¢-"Â¦ -.- â¢-
It Is probable -that special interests
which do -not receive "the consideration
of the bill which they. think they are en
titled-to ; will -attempt to amend.it. This
is especially true of the brewing interests,
which hope to obtain a further reduction
of the tax (on beer from Jl CO a barrel,
as fixed by the committee; to $1 35 a bar
rel.' / A plan ' has been : organized by which
tnese Interests' believe -.they can accom
plish : their, purpose. In. order ;to' secure
this ~. reduction,^ which -.will * amount to
aoout $7.000,000, , that ; amount . of r- revenue
must be attained; -anu- those members who
are working- for a Â¦ further reduction on
beerSwill advocate the- retention of the
tax on bank checks. and discounts, which
amounts : to about-' tne, same sum. -It -is
understood that many of the larger banks
are not opposed r to the ' reduction 'of this
tax, 5 on the 'ground that: it reduces the
number â¢ of small checks presented for
payment, and thus: reduces, the cost of
the clerical force?ln; the -banks.- Most of
the Republican members of the Ways and
Means \ Committee do not Â« believe a suc
cessful f fight can Â¦: be Â¦ waged against any
feature :. of . the t committee's bill.

The engine employed in the attempt
either at murder or suicide is what is
known as a two-burner gas stove. It v,-as
connected with the supply pipe by a short
piece of tubing, but when the officers en

thrown over the partition into the place
where Rosenthal slept. Subsequent to the
police investigation it was Coiled up and

OF CRIME, AND THEIR TAILOR
ING SHOP. v
AN .opera bouffe attempt at mur
der or suicide was ma^e early
yesterday morning in the tailor
shop conducted by Rudolph Mess
and Samuel Rosenthal at 8S3
Haight street. In a small room located
under several pretentious flats "the two
men conduct a place for the alteration
and repair of clothing. Mess has a wife
and three children living in Berkeley,
whom he visits once a week. Rosenthal Is
a widower and has one child In an orphan
asylum and another living with a Mrs.
DeBoe at 1220 Webster street.
The shop occupied by the two men is
also their sleeping apartment. One man
sleeps under tne stairway leading to the
flats above and the other In a small box
like apartment used at various times for
the trying on of rejuvenated clothing. For
some time past. Mess and Rosenthal have
had differences about their financial af
fairs. One time one partner would buy
out the other, and next time the bought
out partner would reciprocate. The en
tire amount of money involved scarcely
approximated 5100.
On Saturday night Mess left Rosenthal
in the place and went 'to the grocery store
of Julius Feiss at the corner of Devlsa
dero and Haight streets, and played cards
until closing timer which according to
Felss Is about 11:20 on Saturday nights.
But his clock was a little fast and he
closed according to the clock.
Mess did not drink, but left the bar
with a pocketful of cigars. He claims
that he went back to the shop and could
not get in. Then he disappeared. It was
not until early morning, about 6:30 o'clock,
that he was found in the neighborhood by
Special Officer George J. Delmar, who
with Patrolmen Nylan and Fenner arrest

Rosenthal claims that after finishing
the day's work he went to bed and was
awakened by the smell of gas. He was
in a half-dazed condition, but managed to
get outside. He claimed -that the supply
hose of the gas stove was pouring deadly
fluid into his room and that the carbon
monoxide would have caused his death
had he not awakened. He notified the
Dolice. Rosonthal was none the worse for
his experience, and after walking around
for a time was able to give the police a
