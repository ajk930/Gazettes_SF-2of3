THE important state -question of . the marriage of^
Priness Maria de las Mercedes to Prince Charles of
Bourbon has been settled according to the wishes of
the royal lovers. The Princess Maria is the eldest
sister of King Alfonso of Spain. The announcement
some months ago of her attachment for the Bourbon Prince
aroused a storm of protest in political circles and threatened
to lead to serious entanglements. Through the influence of
the. Queen Regent the matter has been amicably adjusted.
Last Sunday, the Queen Regent received a graceful letter
from* the father of the Prince asking her daughter's hand .
In marriage for his son. The Queen Regent summoned the
Cabinet and communicated the contents of the letter to the
Ministers. They formally acquiesced and framed a message
authorizing the marriage. This message was transmitted to
the, Cortes yesterday.

LONDON, Dec. 24.â Lord Kitchen
er's dispatches, breathing cond
der.ee hardly Justified by their
contents, are almost the only
available news from the seat of
hostilities* in South Africa, but telegrams
from Cape Town depict the situation In
anything but roseate hues.
Without believing the assertion of the
Transvaal agency in Brussels that 6003
Beers have . invaded Cape Colony, It t*
quite evident that the invasion was a se
r.'ons and well planned affair. In connec
tion .with this a correspondent sends an
extremely interesting letter, dated Bethu
lie, December 1, describing General Dewet
and his doings.
"Dewet has never been taken serlou*-
ly enough," says the correspondent. "It
is of little use to pursue him, as he flghls
a rear- guard action and gains twenty
miles while he is being fought. He is ;i
born military genius, whose wonderful
powers have kept up this phenomenal re
sistance. Once he falls, the whole thinâ¢
could be crushed in a fortnight. He ha*
every single commando under his super
vision. All his patrols and columns march
and counter march on his order. TheÂ»
forces* under his command have been re
duced by his strength of will to a prop
erly organized army, moving at his word.
The sooner the British rid themselves of
the idea that Dewet's forces are a mere
rabble.- wandering aimlessly. thÂ» sooner
they will grasp the need of a deter
mined effort which is necessary to capture
him."
The Cape Colony Cabinet had an im
portant sitting yesterday (Sunday). It ap
pears that the Boers have destroyed a
railway bridge ninety feet long about
twelve miles south of De Aar and no
Cape malls have arrived at Bloemfontem
for three days. Further anxiety has been
caused in Cape Town by the discovery
that during the last two months public
bodies in out-of-the-way places have re
quisitioned supplies of dynamite. The Co-
lonlal Government Is' now* endeavoring to
recover possession of these explosives and
is removing all stores of arms and ammu
nition from suspected depots.
Other advices from Cape Town report
the Dutch element in Cape Colony as
greatly elated over the southward pa53
age of the Boers and as boasting that the
whole district of Victoria West 'will Join
the raiders. It is suspected in Cape Town
that the force traveling from Zootpans
Drift is not a body of Boers, but one of
Colonials, hastening to join the invaders.
The Pletermaritzburg correspondent of
the Dally Mail says: â¢
"The Boers are active between Johan
nesburg and Pretoria, exchanging shots
with the British outposts, and it Us re
ported that pariles of Boers are' hovering
around Johannesburg."

and mules for the British Army, but he

said:
"By the time the horses and mules are

large price for an animal which will, be fit
for service only six weeks. Most of the
animals die because of the change of cli

of the tropics kills them rapidly. The
average death rate on shipboard Is thirty

The American legation In Peking was

The administration officials believe

than ?300,V.:>0.000, and that in case of ina
fcility to properly distribute the indem

attention of The Hague court. In case,
however, it should develop that it is
impossible to agree upon a reasonable

LIVES LOST IN
STORMS AT SEA
NfcW YORK, Dec. 23.â The Journal has
the following from Omaha: Omaha po
lice have found a man -who absolute'y
identifies Pat Crowe as the man who rent
ed the old vacant house to which young
Cudahy was taken, and as the man who
abducted the boy.
Alleged Identification of Crowe.
Reports were in circulation here to
night that one of the Kidnapers of young
Cudahy was under arrest at Fort Dodge.
Iowa. As far as can be definitely
learned, this report had its origin in the
fact that an Armenian named Albi, who
had a considerable sum of gold in his pos
session, was taken from an Illinois Cen
tral train at Fort Dodge on 'Wednesday
night. It Is said, however, that the man
had met an injury on the train and that
he was taken to a hospital in Fort Dod*<Â».
He attracted attention In the hospital
from the fact that he carrietJ so much
gold. It is stated, however, that he left
Omaha some hours before Mr. Cudahy
turned over the ransom.
In the meantime the city is being dili
gently searched for any sign of the other
men described by persons living In the
vicinity of the abductors' prison house.
There is still a dark coiriplexioned man
in the case, but he is larger than Johnson
and younger. Otherwise he is very much
like Johnson, having a black mustache
and dark hair slightly mixed with crey.
If the police have any idea who this man
is they will not admit it. So far as they
know, he was seen by but one person and
that was Eddy Cudahy nimself. The
other bandit was a light complexioned
man with brown hair and long, light mus
tache, slight of build, and whose age is
said to be somewhere between 30 and 35.
The individuals are described by three
persons beside the kidnaped boy, namely
a. K. Munshaw, James Schneiderwind and
Frank Glynn. He Is the man who called
at the Schneiderwind home to engage the
cottage at Thirty-sixth and Grover streets
and who called up the Cudahy mansion
from Glynn's livery state to give notice of
the letters being In the front yard. The
police are satisfied that they know the
man and if he is the person they think he
is. he probably will be in custody within
the next ten days at least. If guilty he
cannot remain at large long, they say.
E. A. Cudahy Sr. still entertains the
theory that If Pat Crowe was not one of
the men who kidnaped his son he will
lose no tirrte in advising him of this fact.
Mr. Cudahy has befriended Crowe many
times in the past.
"Why," said the packer. In the course of
a conversation to-day, "Pat Crowe knows
perfectly well that if he had come to me
a week ago and asked me for J25.000 he
would have got it. He haa often ex
pressed a tense of gratitude for what I
have done for him and I can hardly be
lieve he would turn against me in this
way."
Chief of Police Donahue is well pleasec
with the progress his men are making,
saying that trie arrest of Johnson narrows
the case down by eliminating one of the
extraneous features and centering the
chief interest about^ie "light" man whe
rented the house irlm Mrs. Schneider
wind.
OMAHA. Nebr.. Dec. 23,-The mysteri
out "dark" man in the Cudahy kidnaping
was yesterday arrested by the police from
the description given by Miss Maude Mun-
Fhaw. who lives near the house in which
Eddis Cudahy was held for ransom by his
adbuctors.
His name is Ed Johnson. He Is a laborer
in the Cudahy packing plant and- resides
at Twenty-sixth and Walnut streets. He
admittecLhRving gone out to the Grover
street house three times for the purpose
of renting the building, which he found
alreadjr*let to the "light" man and his
accomplices. Johnson was easily able to
prove to the satistaction of the police and
Mr. Cudahy, who was called in. that ha
bad nothing to do with the cose, and was
allowed to return to his wife and family
of six children.

CLERK MacDONALD
SINKING RAPIDLY
Slayer of Auditor Morris Is
Not Expected to
Recover.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 23.â Samuel Mac-
Donald, the treasury clerk who shot and
killed Frank H. Morris, auditor for the
War Department, at the Winder building
yesterday and then wounded himself, was
in a precarious condition at the emer
gency hospital to-night and his death is
expected momentarily. MacDonald has
been entirely conscious since his removal
to the hospital. His condition this morn
ing seemed more favorable, but to-night
it took a turn for the worse and he began
to sink. He has constantly reiterated the
hope that he would die, declaring that
he did not care to live. To-day many per
sons came to see the wounded man, but
the latter was particularly anxious that
none of his friends should talk to the
t?ewspapers about what he told them. He
even took the precaution to tear up their
visiting cards so that their identity might
not be learned. MacDonald has many
friends in this city, who think that his
mind was unsettled at the time of the
shooting.
An autopsy was performed on the body
of Mr. Morris to-day and developed the
fact that three of the five bullets had
struck him. The body will be taken from
here to-morrow evening to Cleveland. The
interment will be in Lake View Cemetery.
The family of the dead man were the
recipients of many telegrams and letters
of condolence to-day, and among the
touching incidents was a visit of twelve
children of Mr. Morris' Sunday-school
class from Faith Chapel.
Dan A. Grosvenor, deputy auditor for
the War Department and the next in line
of rank to the late Mr. Morris, was dis
charged on Saturday. Mr. Grosvenor re
ceived his discharge papers half an hour
after the killing of Mr. Morris. They
were conveyed to him from the office of
Secretary Gage, the discharge taking ef
fect at once.
Captain Cobaugh of the treasury watch
took charge of affairs at the Winder
building shortly after the shooting on
Saturday, with instructions to report to
XV. XV. Brown, auditor for the Navy De
partment and predecessor of Mr. Alorris,
who has been reinstated in his old posi
tion as auditor for the War Department.

"The President must bear the responsi
bility for any friction that may ensue.
The amended treaty is a bargain to which
we cannot agree and to which no reason
able American who takes the trouble to
reflect upon our side of the question can
expect us to agree. â¢
"When Senator Lodge announced that
Americans expected Europe 'to keep out'
of America he" forgets that England is a
great North American power and expects
to remain such. '
"li the Hay-Pauncefote treaty Is not

BRITAIN CANNOT
ACCEPT TREATY
Colonel Crowder closes with a lummary
of the report of General J. P. Smith,
Military Governor of Negros, showing
that this Island, which | has had,' . under
the entire period of American controy, a
substantially autonomous form of govern
ment, has changed in favorable Â¦â¢ contrast
with the other -islands. The attitude of
the people is highly favorable and tho
largely autonomous government - which
they now enjoy seems to be their fitting
reward, and the people are naturally de
sirous that it should be* continued." But
it will be impossible to discriminate Â¦ In
favor of Negros, the report says, in the
scheme of government to "be ultimately
adopted, so that complications are expect
ed not easy of adjustment. ~-
Colonel Crowder thoroughly indorses
the recommendation of Lieutenant Bur
rett, in charge of the mining bureau, look
ing to a thorough change in the mining
laws. He Bays that these are extremely
cumbersome and that once 'they /'are
brought up to American standards the
mineral condition of the country will soon
be enormously improved, as experienced
prospectors and competent mining engi
neers now In the Islands stand .ready to
undertake the work of exploitation.
The extension of the United States emi
gration laws to the islands without sub
stantial change to meet the local condi
tions is said to have proven of doubtful
expediency, and especially so with regard
to the contract labor law. It is essential,
says the report, for the mercantile inter
ests to secure employes from abroad un
der contract, else business will suffer.
These laborers do not come into competi
tion with the native residents. -More than
25,000 Chinese entered and left the islands
last year. Only one-ninth of the land
in the archipelago has been brought* un
der cultivation and there is no land tax.
Regarding the Judicial department, it
early was found to be necessary to pro
vide a system which would be divested
of those harsh and oppressive features
so much In conflict with American stand
ards. It was impossible, for lack of time,
to supply an entirely new system, so
some changes, regarded as indispensable,
were made byn general order. It appears
that the operations oi the law; as thus
qualified have been satisfactory in secur
ing to defendants in criminal cases the
fundamental rights of Anglo-Saxon crim
inal law. The writ of habeas corpus has
been invoked, and' under its speedy opera
tion nearly one hundred prisoners, the
heritage of Spanish regime, have been lib
erated from unwarranted detention.
The report says a stable currency haa
not been used in the Philippines and Mex
ican dollars were for a few days evenly
exchanged. This was terminated by a
provisional order by the Government by
which It was arranged to reimburse tne
banks for any losses they might sustain
through paying out Mexican silver for
United States currency from disbursing
officers and trade. Doubt Is expressed,
however, as to the desirability of contin
uing this arrangement. The customs ser
vice is discussed at some length in tha
report, and It is stated that there does
not seem to be any present necessity for
any increase in the number of ports of
entry. Attention is directed to the marked
increase in the customs receipts under
American management. This is explained
in part by the fact that formerly a large
part of the imports came from Spain and
paid no duties. Also, the American sys
tem of collection is said to tend to honest
collections. The new tariff adopted for
the islands is set out in detail. In almost
every case specific duties are fixed, fol
lowing the established system in the isl
ands, which It was believed to be danger
ous to change to the ad valorem system.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 23.â The War De
partment has made public a series of re
ports made to General MacArthur by' tho

are closely summarized but sufficiently
lengthy to cover the situation.

MUNCIE. Ind., Dec. 23.â The strike of

cided not to return to work unless they
received the same pay as before. The
management then offered terms, which
were accepted by the men.
Strike Declared Off.
President Rigg said he wanted to be
fair with the men, but their demands
were too sweeping and the company could
not afford to grant them. As a compro
mise President Rigg offered the men 16
cents an hour, but no reduction in the
hours of labor. The conductors and mo
tormen refused to accept this offer, and
gave the company until Thursday to de
cide the matter. After the conference
President RIgg declined to talk, but it is
understood he will not grant the demands,
and a strike is likely to follow.

President Clark arrived to-night and
stated the road would be operated with

The men demand twenty cents an hour

also demand a ten-hour day. The com
pany, in Its answer to the grievance com
mittee, says it is not in a position to af
ford any increase in wages at the present
time.
The strikers met to-night and appointed
committees to man the different railroad
stations. They are to watch for men who
it is reported have been recruited in Phil
adelphia to take their places. They will
also distribute cards to strangers, notify
ing them of the stride and asking them
not to ride on the cars. An appeal to the
local public was also issued asking that
the cars be not patronized.
The tied-up region extends from Pitts

Charles B. Willis the Man Drowned
and Louis Machen Was Killed
by a Train.
SAN JOSE. Dec. 23.â The body of the
man found floating in Coyote Creek yes
terday morning proved to be that of
Charles B. Willis, who for the past two
years has been a resident of this city.
He was a native of New York and aged
31 years. Just how he happened to be in
that locality at night and fall over the
creek bank is a mystery. His mother
testified at the inquest to-day that he was
afflicted with nervous prostration, and
had come to California for his health.
While thus suffering, it is supposed he
was unable to sleep and wandered about.
There were no bruises on the body, and
in his pockets were a gold watch and
$16.50 in coin. He must have been stunned
in falling, as he was drowned in about
four feet of water. At the inquest to-day
a verdict of accidental death was re
turned.
Louis Machen is the name of the man
who was decapitated and mangled by a
freight train at Los Gatos last evening.
He was a laborer and had resided In that
locality about twenty years. It is sup
posed he had been drinking and started
home along the track, and failed to hear
the train as it approached him. The head
and legs were revered from the trunk and
the body mangled almost beyond recogni
tion. Machen was a nfttive of France and
uâ¬ years of age. A Coroner's Jury re
turned a verdict of accidental death.

Slater Knocked Out.
REDDING, Dec 23.â Joe Reay of. the
Olympics knocked out Harry Slater ' of
Los Angeles in the sixth round here last
night. Slater was outclassed.
For some time past it has been the
habit of the conductor on the last car of
the Hayes-street line each nipht to re
quest his passengers to get off the car at
the carhouse and walk on to their homes,
so that the car might be run into the car
house just so much earlier. The car
house is about six blocks from the end
of the road on Stanyan street. For a
block beyond it there is a hill, and then
the track falls again to the terminus. It
is the practice of the car's crew to run
the car to the top of this hill, request the
passengers to alight and walk home and
then run the car back the block to the
carhouse. Sometimes, however, the pas
sengers have objected, and then the car
has been run on out to the turntable.
Saturday night the last car, in charge
of Conductor F. Dunham, had for a pas
senger Michael Eiberger, Â¦who lives on
North Willard street, out beyond the end
of the Hayes-street line. He says that as
the car approached the carhouse the con
ductor putÂ» out the'lights and then told
him he would have to get off at Ashbury
street, the top of the hill beyond the car
houfe, aa the car would go no further.
Eiberger has often walked to the end of
the road from the car house to oblige con
ductors, but he says he did not like the
way in which he was told to get oft the
car, and when it reached Ashbury street
he refused to get off. The car then went
on to the end of the road, and when he
pot off there he and the conductor had
Fome words. Then he started for home,
and had gone but a short distance, he al
leges, when Dunham came after him,
Ptruck him several times In the face and
then ran back.to the car, and it started
back to the carhouse. Â¦Â¦
| Eiberger, says there is much comolalnt
at the way the last car on the Hayes
street line is run. He says he has been
offered his nickel back if he would walk
to the end of the road and allow the car
to run Into the house from the outward
trip.v He'says It is the custom on both
the Hayes and the McAllister street
lines for the last car to run into the*
house on the outward trip when there
are no passengers on it. On the McAl
lister, he says,, they always take-out the
last passengers without question, but on
the Hayes they invite them to get off and
walk the distance to the end of the road,
Â¦while the car's crew makes ten minutes
time on the company and the public.

ARRIVAL IN DAWSON
MAY BE UNWELCOME
THE body of an unknown
man was found hanging from the
limb of a tree in Golden Gate
Park yesterday afternoon by
Owen and William Kuhnert, two
boys who were strolling about the big
pleasure ground. The boys told Police
man Llvlnstone of their discovery and
through him the Coroner's office was no

The man had evidently committed sui
cide. Noosed around his neck were four
ropes, the other ends of which were
wrapped around a heavy limb of the tree.
A short piece of cotton rope formed Into
two slipknots bound the hands of the dead
man &ecurelyÂ»behlnd his back.
From the position of the body the most
likely theory is that the man was deter
mined to die, and after having adjusted
the ropes about his neck, fearing that he
might change his mind and attempt to
save himself, had climbed to the limb, put
COVELO, Dec. 23.â Information received

afloat, discovered by a lumber steumer cm
her return from Ska^uay. Alaska. ThÂ»
name of the vessel is not given.
A small lump of 'Jirty. gray, greasy
stuff was picked up by the crew about
six week ago after discharging a cargo
of lumber at an Alaskan port. The lump
weighed about seventy-five pounds and
when taken on board and examined was
found to be pure ambergris, more valu

STEAMER PICK UP
LUMP OF AMBERGRIS
Detective George McMahon and Tom
Gibson were detailed on the case. After
a short investigation they decided that
there was no evidence of foul play and
that It was a case of suicide.
The body was found a short distance
from the railroad track in a clump of tall
pines and close to the foot of Strawberry
Hill. From the condition of the body it is
evident that the man had been dead at
least three days.
The dead man was about 50 years of
age, of light complexion and wore a full
beard. The condition of his hands showed
that he was a laborer. His clothing was
of a cheap quality, and he wore a pair
of overalls over his trousers. The man
was a cripple, his right foot being much
shorter than the other. Nothing was
found in his clothing which would lead to
his identity.
his hands through the slipknots and after
stretching his arms to more securely
tighten his bonds jumped from the tree
and strangled to death.
SAN RAFAEL, Dec. K.â The friends of
C. J. "Walden. a bookkeeper in the jute
mill at San Quentin, are much exercised,
over the rid?culous story of his alleged
mysterious disappearance. The duties
performed by Mr. Walden at the prison
did not permit any money to pass through
his hands and thus no suspicion of wrong
doing attaches to his absence of the last
few days. They claim that he took a trip
to Nevada, where he had some mining In
terests, and that the probabilities are that
he has been snowed In by the heavy
storms that have prevailed In the high;
mountains there.
Waldon's Friends Confident.
A New York furrier has contracted to
handle all skins from the hare farm. The
feet of the younger rabbits are in deman-1
for watch chains and ornaments and UA
ears are strung unon ribbon and used
for picture frames. The bones and other
parts of the refuse will be shipped to
California for. fertilizing purposes.
The company expects eventually to con
trol the market for fire pressed meats by
substituting for pressed chicken, ham and
beef the finer and, cheaper product of its
cannery.
It is intended to buy up as many hares
as it is possible to obtain for the stock
ing of the ranch. There will be room for
250.0CO and It Is proposed to enlarge the
ranch as rapidly as is necessary to ac
commodate the growth of the herd. The
entire ranch will be fenced with fine wire
to protect the stock from the coyotes and
mountain lions end lo prevent crossing
of the breed with the jackrabbit. Thomas
McGuire. who has had much experience
In California in handling hares, will man
age the ranch and will have the assist
ance of a score of expert handlers of the
hare. The canning factory will be erect
ed in the spring and machinery Is now
being purchased in Chicago. A very large
plant will be built, sufficient to dispose*
of 2000 or more hares per dav. The meat
of the hare is of very fine flavor, being
white in color, resembling the breast
of the chicken. The factory will put the
meat up in various styles and will make
a specialty of preparing It In pressed and
deviled forms, with the intention of sub
stituting It for the expensive preparation
of chicken. Every portion of the hare will
be utilized and not the least Important
part of the business will be the use of the
skins. Belgian hare fur Is of a rich, soft
brown and much in demand for Imitation
of Arctic furs. The suinnier furs are not
valuable, the hair being not firmly root
ed, but the winter akins are as fine as
could be dpsired.
In California alone there are a million
hares and fruit growers are apprehensive
over the damage. to their orchards when
the owners of the rabbitries become flnally
convinced that the hare business is over
done and. Is a flat failure and turn thdr
rabbits loose to live as best they may.
Indeed, so much fear is felt in the frmt
districts that a bill has been prepared
for the next Legislature providing for the
enactment of a law making it a criminal
offense to turn a Belgian hare free.
Foreseeing the fall of the hare business
a company of Arizona and California cap
italists Is being formed to 'take up the
business where the small raisers left off
find for the establishement of a freat hare
farm and a canning factory. The South
western Canning Company will be the
title of the corporation, to be capitalized
at $150,000. A tract of land of 64Â» acres
will be leased In the Buckeye country, in
the lower and most fertile portion of Ari
zona. Half of the land will be planted In
alfalfa and barley to provide feed for thÂ«
hares and the other half will be used as
pasture for the great nerd to be quartered
on the ranch. >
PHOENIX, Ariz.. Dec. 23.â Like wild
fire the Belgian hare craze swept over the
country and died out just aa quickly. It
Is estimated that within a year $2,000,003
has been spent on the Belgian hare an-I
that there are; 8,000,000 of the little ani
mals in the United States* while the re
markable fecundity of the hare will
triple that number in the year, despite the
enormous quantity to be U3ed on the
table.

By finding in the ruins of Central and
South American cities evidences that
they were built by descendants of Levi.
the Mormons hope to give to the world
a proof that the Book of Mormon is what
the Latter Day Saints clUm it to beâ a
true history of the first people who in
habited this hemisphere.
According to Mormon traditions. Levi
and Ishmael, accompanied by their fami
lies, left Jerusalem about 600 B. C. built
boats and sailed toward this continent,
landing where Chile now Is. Levi had
two sons, Nephl and Lamanâ Nephl
obedient and Laman troublesome. The
party grew and two factions set
tled around the two sons as lead
ers. Finally the race numbered many
thousand, and built many cities in what
is now New Mexico, Arizona, Mexico and
Central and South America. The two
factions warred war for several centuries,
and about 400 A. D.. the Nephltes were ex
terminated by the Lamanltes, from whom
the American Indians have descended.
Maroni. the last of the Nephltes, buried
the records of his people, on a brass plate,
in the hill. "Cumorah," in New York
State, and an angel revealed these plates
to Joseph Smith, who founded the Book
of Mormon from the records.
In one large chamber, isolated from the
others, they found a great stone casket
in which were the bones of what had been
a very large man, and In the stone were
engraved figures to show that tje de
ceased was a ruler among his people. A
large pile of tablets, probably records of
his reign, were at the rear of the casket,
and many of them will be sent North' for
examination by expert antiquarians. The
party will continue its expedition south
ward.
PHOENIX. Ariz., Dec. 23â Letters re
ceived in this city to-day tell of important
antiquarian dlscoveres made in Southern
Mexico and Central America, by a party
of Mormon explorers. Three months ago
the party began a three years' trip down
Into South America, for the purpose of
searching for traces of the last survivors
of the Nephltes, believed by the Mormons
to have been the first people in this coun
try. Benjamin Cluff. president of the
Brigham Young Academy in Provo, Utah,
is in charge of the expedition, and has
twenty-four students under his charge.
In a letter to a friend here. Professor
Cluff states that many prehistoric ruins
have been examined by the party and
evidences unearthed which tend plainly
to uphold the Mormon traditions. At one
place, in the southern part of the State
Oi Durango. they found the remains of
what appeared to have once been a city
of very large size, and in the largest ruin
dug out a stone casket In which were
found hieroglyphics which correspond
with those in the brass tablets said to
have been found in Xew York, and which
were translated into the Book of Mormon.
Further excavations revealed a burial
p.ace. where a large number of human
bones were found, some of the skeletons
in an excellent state of preservation.
Stone tablets were foun<". and marked in
such a manner and with such figures as
are found on the Painted Recks in Ari
zona.

SEATTLE, Dec. 23.â The steamer
Charles D. Lane was towed Into Seattle
harbor last night in a disabled condition.
She was picked up at Cape Flattery,
where she lay anchored in a dangerous
position with her fires all drowned out.
She had encountered heavy weather and
had taken a great deal of water, which
compelled her to. tucn back after a 24
hour run, but her stea!h failed before jjhe

CHICO. Dpc. 23.â Thf arrest of Attorney
Charles Stillson and R. JDiller, which oc
curred last nfght, has caused a degree
cf excitement here which has only Tr^en
equalled in Chico upon one occasion.
That was when Dr. J. E. Rouley and John
M. Garner were placed under arrest on
charges of forging the famous Fuller wilL
Stillson had been the attorney for one
James Cain, who was some years ago
appointed gruardian of an insane person
named B. D. Finn^san." After Finne
gan's death Cain was appointed adminis
trator of the estate. Stiilson continuing
to act as his attorney.
When Cain rendered his account to the
court it was found that there was a short
age of some {1'jOO, and very shortly after
the discovery was made that nearly all
the papers in the estate were reported by
Stillson u> have been stolen from his of-
Tice, and the papers have not been seen
since that time. Stillson explained that
he had taken the paper? from his safe
and laid them on his table, intending to
ro over them, but was called out, and
Â¦when he returned the papers were gone.
None of SUllman's friends had sus
pected, however, that he was telling
aught but the truth, but during the past
week the grand jury haÂ« been making an
Investigation, with the result that he was
indicted on a charge of concealing public
document*.
Stillson is one of the oldest residents
of Chico. For several years he con
ducted the largest hardware store in the
city, but was later elected County Clerk,
which position he held for four terms. I
Retiring from politics he began the prac
tice of law in Chico and has a very large
clientele. -
Dlller 1? also an old citizen and real
estate dealer of Chico. Some months ago !
he was authorized to sell a tract of land '
north of this city, which he succeeded in
doini?. and it is charged against him that
in the deal he contrived to pain a double
fee by misrepresentation to the purchaser.
Both men declare their innocence, and

declaration.

Tne latest novelty in war is a substance which is
being supplied to the British soldiers in South Africa
and is known as "solid beer." It is said to be a pre
paration of malt and hops' in the form of a jelly.
When mixed with water it can be fermented any
where, and is reported to be very. good. Experiments
have been made in our own army with concentrated
rations in the form of tablets. The ; two inventions
would .work well together. - You take an American
tablet, put some of the* British, jelly, on it, and you
have a dinner of beef and 'beer. What more could
you wish for a cent?

Joseph Weldon Bailey of Texas, once known as
"Boy Bailey" and regarded as the hope of the Demo
crats of Congress, has been out of sight and out of
mind for some time, but he is not to be wholly lost
to fame. It is said a tobacco firm has named a brand
of cigarettes after him.
Galveston has so far recovered from the effects
of the hurricane as to do a little blowing herself just
for the fun of it Thus the News of that city recently
said: "The construction of the Nicaragua canal, the
possession of the Philippines and the open door in
China will make Texas the greatest State in the
Union." All of which is excellent, but the News for
gets California.
A young woman in New York sued the keeper of
her lodging-house for a latch key. alleging that fre
quently when she returned at night she found the
door locked and the landlord would not get up to
open it for her. The Judge refused to grant the latch
key. but ordered the landlord to have the door open
until midnight. It thus appears to be New York law
that women must be home before midnight or forfeit
lhe right to admission. As theaters do not close
until 11 o'clock in these days, there is just one hour
allowed a woman in which to get her supper and
make her home run; and it will be seen the effect
of the law will be to develop in women a speed al
together undesirable.
THE amount appropriated in the pending river
and harbor bill touches the high water mark.
Sumptuous as it is, California's share is rather
limited. San Diego gets cash $50,000 and on contract*
$217,850, and San Luis Obispo cash $50,000 â a total^of
only $317,850 out of the $60,000,000 carried by the bill.
The East has been long in receipt of appropriations,
and one would suppose that the work in that section
had been accomplished, so that the expense could be
reduced to a minimum. But the contrary, appears.
Boston harbor gets $3,600,000; though it has been in
receipt of appropriations long enough, and large
enough, to have made the work permanent as the
Havre basin. Buffalo gets more than twice as much
as all California, and the sea and lake ports of New
York get eight times as much as the whole Pacific
Coast. The Ohio River, described by John Randolph
many years ago as a streak of dust half the year and
a streak of mud the other half, gets $2,350,000, and not
a dollar appears for the San Joaquin and Sacramen
to! Trinity River, Texas, gets $750,000. Naturally,
seaports and rivers upon which commerce is just im
pressing demands for transportation and facilities
should expect a greater expenditure, if needful, than
old ports long the object of Government care, and
rivers upon which there is. no. new demand.
The river and. harbor bill has always been a log
rolling affair. When Henry Clay reported it in the
House, about seventy years ago, he refused it further
indorsement than to say: ' "I take it as I took my
wife, for better or for worse," and for better or for
worse it has been ever since.

While such statements are somewhat exagger
ated, they do not materially misrepresent the political
condition of Great Britain as revealed by the press.
The absorbing political issue there is not a question
of measures, but of men. The writer from whom we
have quoted appears^to be. fully justified in asserting
that the country is prepared to support a strong man,
no matter which side he may take. When such a
temper prevails in the public mind of a great empire,
the unexpected is very apt to happen, and the next
session' of Parliament may open the new century in
Great Britain with something sensational in foreign
or domestic politics.
Drawing his conclusion from the evident demaml
for a leader and the apathy displayed by both the
Conservatives and the Liberals in Parliament, he goes
on to say: "Public life never offered more brilliant
prizes to a Canning, or a Disraeli, or a Randolph
Churchill than it does now to any one capable of
following in their footsteps. To some new man the
future assuredly belongs. England is in a mood, to
surrender herself to, not necessarily to a prodigy of
genius, a Napoleon of politics, but to any man of
marked independence, faith and capacity. The
country is weary to sickness ., of the old gang
and the old ways. There never was a time
when party allegiance was more detachable,
or when a strong leader capable of con
structive patriotism was more certain to command the
overwhelming support of the country, upon which
ever side he may appear."/.: :T
A writer signing himself "Young England" con
tributes to the current number of the National Review
a striking summary of existing conditions and points
out that the time is opportune for the coming of
a new man. He says:. "There never was an oppo
sition which offered less noble' sport to its opponents
or gave less: opportunity for: serious attack. There
never was a Conservative government, 'on the othc*
hand, which practiced a more systematic neglect oi
its followers, or made less effort to draw out the tal
ent which has failed to appear." He declares, "The
abject and characterless docility of the Conservative
rank and file in the House of Commons has be
numbed the whole mass of the party."
r~Ij ROM almost all parties in Great Britain there
I comes a cry for a leader. . The Liberals are
demoralized, the Conservatives are discontent
ed and the Radicals are wandering about like lost
sheep. The condition of the Democratic party in- the
United States is bad, but the condition of British
parties is worse. Hardly any one appears satisfied
with Salisbury, or his Cabinet, or his policy; and yet
nearly all prefer him and his to anything the oppo
sition has to offer. .
A LEADERLESS EMPIRE.
It is but reasonable to expect a cordial co-op
eration with the movement now being made to pro
cure from the coming Legislature an increase in the
revenues of the institution. That, indeed, is one of
the urgent measures of the time and should" receive
prompt attention when the Legislature meets.
We have, then, a university whose attendance is sec
ond to but one in the Union, whose education is as
free as any, whose administration is more economical
than any. whose increase is more rapid than any.
What Californian can be indifferent to the credit
given the State by the existence of such an institu
tion, founded by the people and maintained by the
people for the good of the people?
On that showing it will be perceived there is noth
ing extravagant in the desire of the Regents to have
the income of the university increased by $100,000
From a recent statement of the financial condition of
the university made by President Wheeler it appears
that, excluding the $27,000 income derived frpm the
Wilmerding fund and used for the support of the
Wilmerding School, the income for next year may
be estimated at $410,000. Of that sum $56,000 will b2
set apart for permanent improvements, $28,000 â¢ for
Lick Observatory, and $10,000 must be used for
scholarships. Thus there will be available for imme
diate educational uses at the university little mor.e
than $300,000, an amount less than that which the
collegiate department of Harvard University collects
from tuition alone.
Q MOXG the facts brought out by the discus
/ \ sion at the Palace Hotel on Saturday evening
of the best means of increasing the income of
the State University are these: The university in point
of attendance is second to but one in the Union; in
the course of its comparatively short career it has
surpassed all the great institutions of the East with
the single exception of Harvard; in the past decade
the increase in the number of students has been about
400 per cent, or five times the percentage of increase
of income; upward of eighty-seven per cent of the
students now at Berkeley are from California and the
proportion of those coming from points distant from
the bay counties is increasing annually; the cost of
university maintenance at Harvard is $229 per
student, at Columbia $565, while at Berkeley it is
but $165.
THE STATE UNIVERSITY.
Out on this coast the situation has shown no change
worthy of note for some weeks. Business is quiet, but
not more so than usual during the holidays. The sea
son in California has been exceptionally good for the
farmers thus far. and farm work has been pushed so
rapidly and energetically that barring the normal mis
haps liable to occur in the spring the State ought to
harvest abundant crops. This gives general con
fidence to merchants and bankers, and as a result
times arc very easy. The export trade of this port
kteps up to a high pressure pitch, though it is not as
lively as during the early fall months, nor was it ex
pected that that abnormal activity would never come
to an end. Merchandise is showing more relative life

of wool show an increase, but prices have not recov

arc quieter and rather lower, and leather is also
easier, but the boot and shoe trade is reported weli
si'.pplied with orders. Western hardware men report
the best fall business on' record, but new business in
iron and steel is light. The general shutdown of fur
races usual at this season is lacking this year, how
ever, owing to the abundant orders on the market
which will require months to fill. Wheat and provis
ions remain about as before, being aevoid of any
c^pecial activity, and ihe former, indeed, has been ex
tremely dull for the past fortnight.
Still, the weekly commercial reports show that busi
ness is apparently good all over the country- The
wholesale trade is quiet, of course, as the retailers do
about all the business just before Christmas; but the
general distribution *of merchandise seems up to the
average, except in the Northwest, where unseasonable
weather and a short spring wheat crop operate against
commercial activity. The West and South are sending
ir. uniformly good reports, while better weather along
the Atlantic seaboard has stimulated the distributive
fade in that section.
BUSINESS AND THE HOLIDAYS
TRADE thremghout the United States continues
of a holiday character. The bank clearings last
week again dropped off, showing a gain over
the same week last year of. only It, and the
three largest cities lost. This gain has been marked
of late, hence the falling off last week indicates a'pro
nounced holiday lull. The failures were 260, against
211 for the corresponding week in 1899.

The fight against Chandler is a bitter one. His
course in the Senate has been frequently irritating
to almost every member of that body. He is cranky,
erratic, sarcastic, and gifted with a multitude of words
with which to display every varying mood of his ec
centric nature. He claims that the fight against him
is made by the railroads, but the claim is hardly jus
tifiable. How the contest will result is not yet cer
tain. At this time it appears to be anybody's fight
and Blair's chances are not to be despised.
â¢ Politics is so full of surprises 'that it is a common
saying no one should be surprised at anything that
happens in the political world. Nevertheless even the
oldest stagers will be a little startled if after all these
years the old man should return to the Senate.
OUT of the fight now going on in New Hamp
shire against the re-election of Senator Wil
liam E. Chandler there has come the unex
pected. Persons of middle age and good memories
may recall that there was once such a statesman as
Henry W. Blair. He had as a pet measure an educa
tional bill designed to give Federal aid to the educa
tion of the negroes in the Southern States that was
much discussed at one time. He has not been heard
of in a long time, and most people have thought him
to be dead. He is very much alive, however, and we
learn from our Eastern exchanges that he is once
more a candidate for the Senate and has a fair chance
of winning. - *1 ~j
Blair has been out of politics so long that no one
remembers how he ?ot out. His friends are now
claiming that when in office he 'was one of the most
useful Senators New Hampshire ever had. One of
them is quoted by the New York Tribune as saying
in a recent interview: "Half of the pension law?,
under which $150,000,000 is now annually disbursed,
originated with Blair, and of this amount New Hamp
shire receives $1,500,000. It was Blair's cam
paign in the old Third District in 1875 that
saved the State and insured the Presidential vote
to the Republicans in 1876, when only one vote save-1
the Presidency to Republican party. Blair
originated the Department of Labor, and his efforts
to exclude foreign cheap labor from this country
were so effective as 10 lead the Chinese Government
to reject him when he was appointed Minister to that
empire. Blair's record in local New Hampshire poli
tics is fully as creditable as it is in the wider arena of
national legislation. Among other things he suc
ceeded in saving the Portsmouth Navy-yard to the
State in spite of tremendous opposition."
AN UNEXPECATE D REVIVAL.
Russia Is the only naval power that
succeeds In maintaining secrecy aboot de
tails of ship construction. Reliable data
relating to vessels building by contract In
the yards of foreign countries are difficult
to obtain. Tni3 latter difficulty, however.
Is chiefly due to tha fact that none of the
vessels are built from the original de
signs, and that numerous and ma.terla!
changes are zn&da during the progress of
construction, which make Russian con
tracts undesirable*. Tha latest Informa
tion regarding the toreÂ© new battleships
building at St. Petersburg states that they
are to be of 13,600 tons displacement and
are to have bottoms of four-inch hardened
steel and lateral bulkheads of tha sama
thickness, as a protection against tor
pedo attacks. It is evident that the dis
placement is insufficient to carry an ar
mored bottom four inches in thickness
and also a nine-inch belt, five-Inch case
mate anrt four-Inch protective deck, and
the Russian naval authorities are simply
mystifying If not deceiving foreign naval
experts.

WORLD'S NAVAL NEWS.
Let it be borne in mind, then, by every legislator
that what is demanded this year is a strictly business
session at Sacramento. We have had enough of party
politics and of faction fights and of crooked schemes
and cinch bills. This time* the public demands
straight politics and a businesslike efficiency from
start to finish.
It is important that the session be njade one of
business, for much in the way of legislation ought to
be enacted this winter. The last regular session was
hardly more than a contest over the Senatorship.
The extra session did not by any means make up for
the lack of good work during the previous one.
This time, therefore, the amount of work required of
the Legislature is even greater than usual, and it
will be impossible for the legislators to satisfy the
people unless the whole session from first to last be
given to legitimate legislative work, entered upon in
a spirit of honesty and performed with strict fidelity
to duty.
The Republican party will, of course, be held re
sponsible for the actions of the session, and it is but
right it should have that responsibility. The candi
dates of the party were elected upon definite pledges
of providing legislation for the public good, and they
should be held to the pledges they have made. The
Call, though a stanch and stalwart Republican paper,
will nevertheless take the side of the people against
?.ny attempt that may be made by legislators calling
themselves Republican to violate any pledge given to
the cause of economy, progress, improvement and
good government generally.
It will be well for Republican leaders who are to
direct affairs at Sacramento to enter upon the work
of the Legislature with the same spirit that animates
the national party leaders at Washington. At the
present outlook there is hardly anything likely to oc
cur during the session to seriously delay business if
the business be resolutely undertaken. There is no
Senatorial contest to take up time and to cause dis
sensions. The only cloud upon the horizon is | the
danger that the bosses may undertake to carry an un
fair apportionment bill or to enact a primary elec
tion law that would insufficiently protect the rights of
honest citizens at the primaries. If the bosses can bo
made to keep their hands, off those matters, and the
apportionment act and the primary election bill be
properly and rightly Jrawn. ail will be well.
F"\ EPUBLICAN leaders at Washington have
Vâ / promised the country to do all in their power
to keep Congress during this session strictly
attentive to important business. So far as it is possible
all partisan measures will be set aside in order that
the great interests of the country involved in the
Nicaragua canal, the Pacific cable, the merchant
marine, and in other measures of the kind, may be
promoted and advanced by necessary legislation.
Such is the promise and every prospect points to the
conclusion that it will be kept; that the session will
be marked by so much in the way of accomplishment
as will make it memorable in the annals of Congress.
A SESSION FOR BUSINESS.
The problem of keep the silt in motion to its
mouth, thus avoiding the filling of the channel and
consequent overflow, reems almost beyond the power
of man to solve.
One startling feature of the bill is the amount re
quired in works to control and keep open to navi
gation the Mississippi River, for, which $11,700,000 is
appropriated. But that is one of the world's greatest
rivers, with a vast watershed/and carrying such a vol
ume of silt as to make its control one of the hardest
1 roblems of modern engineering. That river has ear
ned the silt that has pushed back the waters of the
gulf from above Memphis. ' The land it has built is of
great richness, inviting to agriculture, but subject to
overflow as the river^builds a ridge and jumps out of
its old bed to form a new one.
ter the growing commerce of this bay looks for ac
commodation when the; facilities of San Francisco
are outgrown. If. the surplus cannot resort to Oak
land it must go to Puget Sound, and California has "a
great interest in retaining it here.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 23.â At the last
meeting of the Senate Committee on Mili
tary Affairs, the proceedings of which
have just been made , public. Secretary
Root made a strong presentation of the
necessity for immediate legislation for the
relief of the army. He stated broadly
that if Congress did not at once indorse
the army bill in substantial accordance
with the recommendations of the War
Department the United States would be
obliged to abandon a large portion of the
Philippine Islands where civil government
Is established. If the present garrisons
are withdrawn from certain portions of
the island the municipal oltlcers, mostly
Filipinos, would be left defenseless, witft
every prospect of being deprived of their
lives and property, ana at the same time
the United States would be disgraced, tne
Secretary said, for having proved faith
less to its solemn obligations. The Secre
tary argued that It was necessary to pass
the department bill as a whole in order to
properly adjust the military organization
to the new conditions created by the in
crease of numbers.
"We do not any of us," he said, "ex
pect that for any considerable period. an
army of 100,000 men will be maintained,
and for an army of 60,000 men the provis
ions made (by the committee) are suffi
cient." -
With reference to the matter of staff de
tails, the Secretary said that he was con
vinced that the. control of the permanent
staff departments In the city of Washing
ton was an evil that ought to be reme
died, and that it was highly important for
the army th_t there should be inter
changeable service, between the linÂ© and
the staff. In answer to an Inquiry the
Secretary said that it was of minor Im
portance Â¦whether there waa a corps or
regimental - formation of the artillery
branch, and that while he favored the.
former ha really cared very little about
the matter, which ho regarded as a purely
technical question.
Secretary Boot devoted considerable at
tention in bis testimony to the army can
teen, urging that it was a great means of
maintaining the morality, health and dis
cipline of the troops. He pointed out that
the post exchange was a club where the
men got together to read, talk and smoke,
playing checkers - and ; other games and
drinking under such natural restraints aa
the place afforded. A prohibition of the
canteen, the Secretary said, would inter
fere with enlistments, as the men would
not enlist If they knew they were going
to be confined In a reform school. He
considered the agitation against the can
teen as a misguided one, showing that the
abolition of the canteen would drive the
soldiers out of the post exchange, where
they are subject to salutary restraints,
into the demoralizing and vicious sur
roundings outside of army posts.' It
would result in more drinking and more
deception among those who drank.
The Secretary also pointed out that the
proposed enactment would convey an en
tirely erroneous and prejudicial view to
the public as to what had been the course
of . the army In regulating the sale of
liquor up to this time.

that he had died from pneumonia, instead
of injuries from the fall he had In tha
Madison Square Garden race. He con
tracted pneumonia, however, during tha
race.
Tom Ryan and his friends put a big
crimp in the ring last Saturday over the
win of Vincitor. It Is rumored the Illinois
owner conditioned the Brutus horse for
the race. That lends quite another shade
to the outsider's victory, and if Mr. Boots
would engage a competent trainer he
would put an end to a lot of uncompli

horses from the Elmwood farm stable.

PHILADELPHIA. Dec. 23.â As a result
of the fatal termination of the amateur
bout last night at the Philadelphia Ath
letic Club between Joseph Kelly and Ed
ward Sanford. who fought under the
name of Frank Barr, boxing contests
have been prohibited for the present by
the police authorities.
: Director of Public Safety English to-day
issued an order to the police to the effect
that all permits for sparring ccmtests
heretofore Issued are- revoked, and that
no more permits will be granted for the
same for the present, and that the police
8 re instructed to prohibit sparring exhi
bitions until further notice. There are
quite a number of athletic clubs in this
city where boxing contests, both amateur
and professional, were held, six rounds
being the limit prescribed by law.
The exact cause of Sanford's death will
not be made public by the Coroner until
the Inquest Is held to-morrow. The re
port that' his skull was fractured Is er
roneous. Frank Henderson, manager of
the club, who acted as referee, was to
day released on J1000 security. Kelly and
the seconds of both boxers are still in
custody, being held without ball to await
the action of the Coroner's jury.
SAYS HE IS IN" FINE FORM.
Tod Sloan confirms the report that he
will ride In the Christmas handicap. When
seen last night at the Palace Hotel the
little Jockey was playing pool, although
he had to balance himself on his toes
at every shot. He declared himself as
being exceedingly gratified at the chance
of steering a winner over the Tanforan
track.
"I shall be glad to be riding again," he
Bald, "and am looking forward to dolns
good work with my mount. I fe$l In line
trim for what Is left of the season, and
hope to show that I am still in my old
form."
"I hope my reappearance will give sat
isfaction to my friends and silence my
enemies," was Sloan's summing up of
what he wishes for Cnrlstmas.

live bird season at a shoot yes
terday on the Inpleside traps.
From east and west, north and south the
crowd congregated to see the jockey who
was In England and the bookmaker
sportsman kill birds on the wager of a
dinner and other things. The crowd was
disappointed, although it saw James To.l

Coleman sing to the birds, one of which
was of the jail varietyâ its left foot hav

prevented ready flight and made the bird
an easy mark for the bookmaker's gun.
The disappointment came in the post
ponement of the match between Coleman
and Sloan. A plethoric presence of live
bird experts was the reason of It. Every
body wanted to shoot on all conditions
and for all sorts of prizes, so Colemin

Koenigs 4, Alamedas 4.
Thirteen Innings of baseball and no re
sult, darkness having come upon the field
to prevent a settlement of what was the
fastest, closest game of baseball seen on
the Recreation grounds in many a long
day. The Koenigs and the Alamedas dis
tinguished themselves yesterday, and pro
fessionals might have taken a* lesson from
the gingery, snappy game that resulted
from the clash of these two teams.
For four Innings the game was error
less. Then Van Haltren, he of New York,
misjudged a fly way out in center field
and three men scored. When Brockhoft
hit this hot liner there were two of the
Koenigs in the cemetery. Brockhoff went
to third on his effort and scored soon
after on a hit. This play of Van's gave
the Koenigs their only runs.
In the ninth inning the Alamedas tied
the score, and from that stage of the
game until the end the playing was fast
and brilliant. W. Hammond and Dun
leavy, fresh from Montana, wore the Ala
meda uniform. The score:

FASTEST KIND
OF CLOSE BALL
F. Jones' Wedgewood romped through
the big 12S dog open stake at L'nion Cours
ing Park yesterday, beating Lady Claire
In the deciding course of an event v;hich
from start to finish was interesting and
productive of high-class sport.
In adding another victory to his list
Wedgewood has strengthened his reputa
tion as a clever and hard-working per
former and a record-making youngster.
ThoiiRh in his Fixth course but four points
were made against him end on three OQca
sions he kejit his opponents from scoring
at all, Wedgewood seemed to be In dan
ger several times, but went In with great
dash and energy, and would not be denied
the kill. In the nnal.' Lady Claire could
have evened the score had she got the kill,
but the youngster was too determined and
beat her to it.
Pasha Kennels' May Hempstead was the
pood thing of the day. Three times on
the short end she upset calculations, out
working the fast Warship In the second
at odds of 7 to 2, and repeating the opera
tion to his kennel mate in the next round
at 4 to 1. In the fourth round of the stake
she got the decision from i-rutus, who
was quoted a 5 to 1 favorite, by her show
of cleverness, scoring 21 to his 18. She is
by Firm Friend-Valley Queen, and is the
only breed of that dam which has shown
grreat cleverness.
Roman Athlete, too, performed well,
showing great speed ai.d strength, and
would have gone further Into the finals
were it -not for a haru go with Beauty
Spot. She bids fair to get to the front as
the top notcher of her kennels. Rocker
and War Eagie were beaten In the semi
final.
The short ends were: Athena beat Rona
at 3 to 1. Vandal beat Spiteful and Ran
dom Aim beat Sir Pasha at 5 to 3 Boney
Boy beat Iowa Boy and Master Lawrence
beat Anchor at 6 to 2; War Eagle beat
Bad Boy 5 to 3, Vandal beat iia-lean
Gladys at 2 to 1, Castaway beat Golden
Russet 3 to 1, Roman Athlete beat Master
Claire 2 to 1. Be: uty Spot beat Forest
King at 5 to 2, and Roman Athlete at 2 to
I; Castaway beat Mose at 5 to 2. and Lady
Claire beat War Eagle at 5 to 4.
The hares, while In good condition, com
menced to show the form for this time
of year and as a result even coursing pre
vailed. Throughout the day not a bye
was run. Lady Claire got secowd place
by general clever work, and her perform
ance adds more credit to Emin Pasha as
a Fire. The days results, with Judge John
Grace's official scores, follow:

WEDGEWOOD AGAIN
A STAKE WINNER
Now that Tod Sloajn has been granted a
license by the San Francisco Jockoy
Club the iittle man of many episodes will
appear in the saddle at Tanforan Park on
Christmas day. In the lace of the recent
muss on the English turf and the action
of the California Jockey Club in uphold
ing: the action of the racing stewards o;i
the other side one must doff his hat to the
management of the San Ma.UK) County
track for its daring in the way of adver
tising. Tod will prove a very strong
drawing card ar.d will sport the colors of
Waltor Jennings on Vesuvian in the han
dicap. Although now in trouble the dimin
\jtivt- rider'* niany victories on the Eng-
Usn and French turf J.ave made for him
many friends and he will be the recipient
of a" warm reception.
Clem Jenkins, a California boy who has
earned fame and dollars by his splendid
work in the saddle both on the Eastern
and Er-glteh tracks, dropped -into town
Saturday night. Jenkins went East last
*;>rir.K to ride for J. M. Murphy, whose
firing is trained by the veteran W. H.
Kopers. On several occasions horses
from the stable performed peculiarly,
t rodit fcr which was given to Clem, and
at one time the Caliloxr.ian w-as under
suspicion. Later he wjis exonerated and
now- that the matter is a thine of the
past boldly says Rogers ran the hor^.'s
Â¦short" and that he knows positively W.
H. Cheppu. a bookmaker, laid against
:hrm. On the day Tower of Candles was
badly beaten last summer Jenkins state3
he knew the nlly was in no condition to
race and once thought of so informing thi
Ft t wards. He failed to do so. however,
and was raked over the coals in great
phape by the Eastern critics for her show
ir.K. The California boy's reputation was
always pood when riding here, as his ex
cellent record of winning mounts will at
test.
After obtaining his release from Mur
nhy. Jenkins crossed the water to ride for
the South African millionaire Curtis. The
latter turfman did not care to pay much
for the services of a good rider, so Jen
kins signed to pilot the horses owned by
Prince Soltykoff. He scored a hit, and
will return to England in February- to
ride for the Prince next season. Clem
said his first mount at Newmarket was
astride Ed Corrlgan's mare Sardonic, and
he succeeded in beating out Goosander a
neck, ridden by Sammy Loates. He was
a brand new one to the Englishmen, who
efked as he returned to dismount, "what
Moody twister was that?"
Racing Secretary Power appears to be
the right man in the right place. The
card to-day would be difficult to excel.
Some daS's ago when Tuthill won at
Tar.foran. a big "killing" was made in
the down town and out of town pool
rooms.
The following horse? have been left In
the Christmas handicap. The riders
given will in most cases be up on the

few doubtful starters, some changes may

will begin Wednesday morning at the
theater box office.
But Giesecke discovers the identity
of Siedler with the lawyer'.for the "other
side," he swears he will seek other hous
ing, and the strongest situation of the
play ends the first scene, with the charm
ing daughter, the maiden aunt and ' the
furious papa seated upon a large trunk
in front of the hotel In the midst of a
pouring rainstorm. The storm is very life
like^ by the way, real water and the rest
of it. Of course Miss Giesecke and the
lawyer make it up, through the entirely
unconscious connivance of papa, and the
story ends. happily for all concerned.
The cleverest work in the very clever
work done by the company Is Mower's
Giesecke, which is a brilliantly life-like
portrait. Some few Americanisms oc
casionally heard rather jar, but otherwise
it is a case of complete identity with the
character. The head waiter, Brand, in
Frank W. Norcross' hands, Is a bright
piece of bourgeoiserie. The landlady, Jo
sepha, Minerva Dorr, is an excellent con
ception, and Giesecke's daughter, Louise
Randolph, is a dainty and charming por
trait. Charlotte, the maiden aunt, is de
lightfully caricatured by Lucie Mower,
and Walter Chester does the baldheaded
youth with much humor. Bernice Nor
cross slips many cogs In her lisping dia
lect, but, like all the women. Is very
pretty to look upon. Her father, Hinzel
mann.an Isben conception, Is most quaint
ly and tenderly played by John Fenton,
and the rest of the parts are all well
handled. Â¦

A THOROUGHLY wholesome and
altogether delightful little comedy
Is "At the White Horse Tavern,"
the week's attraction at the Cali
fornia Theater. Not for many
moons has the theater had bo charming a
programme as thia German comedy, ade
quately translated by Sydney Rosenfeld
and splendidly presented by the King &
Norcross company.
The scene of the play Is laid In the
Austrian Alps, at the White Horse Tav
ern, in Salzkammergut. and the several
love affairs of the landlady and the head
waiter and the guests who enjoy their
hospitality are the materials for this
admirable little comedy. The curtain
opensâ and closesâ upon a picturesque Inn
on the shores of an Alpine lake, surround
ed by snow-capped mountains, and tho
scene Is a distinctly clever example of
this department of stage craft. To this
inn come the guests from the little lake
steamer in moat realistic fashionâ an ab
sorbed bride and groom, to whom all
scenery looks alike; the typical Alpine
tourist and the travelers from Berlin,
Wilhelm Giesecke, his sister and daugh
ter, nnd Siedler, a lawyer intimately con
nected with their affairs but unknown to
them, with whose doings the play is
chiefly concerned.
It seems that Giesecke, a bluff, crusty
but thoroughly kind-hearted German
burgher (done with admirable touch and
grip by Fred Mower), has lost a lawsuit
against one Sutro, which has been drag
ging along for three years, and through
which he has found a temper and lost In
terest in life. Sledler (W. E. Hitchcock)
was the man In the case, and the lawyer
and Giesecke find themselves at the same
hotel for the purpose of spending the
summer holidays. Siedler has spent other
summers there to good purpose, as tho
buxom landlady, though all unknown to
him, has honored him with her prefer
ence, with the result of the best room in
the house, "double portions of delica
cies" and so forth being placed at his
service. The head waiter, who is himself
in lovo with mine hostess, discovers and
objects to this and revenges himself by
giving Siedler's room to Giesecke under
plea of the former's late arrival. Much
fun is furnished by the conflict between
the lawyer and the Berlin burgher for
possession of the room. Then Giesecke's
pretty daughter appears on the scene,
the susceptible lawyer falls captive
to her charms and surrenders the
room with the utmost willingness.
BERKELEY MAY NO
LONGER BE DRY
formance of equal artistic value has but
s.eldom been seen at the price here or any
where elfce. The play is apparently in for
a long run, as it has only once been seen
here before; and the next production will
he "Woman and Wine." a London and
New York success.

The Alcazar Theater will have a star
attraction this week in Belasco's comedie
risque, "Naughty Anthony," a delightful
farce, borrowed from the French. The
play Is founded upon a Chatauquan by
law, which runs as follows: "Rule 13.
Any persons of opposite sexes found using
the summer house, of Lofty Park for os
culatory purposes will be punished to the
fullest extent of the law and their names
will be published!" Naughty Anthony, a
professor of moral culture at the college,
and chief inspiration of the aforesaid
edict, himself falls under its ban, and his
attempts at evasion of the by-law and the
consequent complications form the plot
of the play.

JUMPS TWO STOBIES TO
DEATH WHILE DEMENTED
Michael McGuirk, an Old Man, Seeks
Swift Surcease of His
Troubles.
Michael McGulrk. an old man, while
laboring under some mental disorder, yes
terday ended his life by Jumping from the
window of a two-story building at 1571
Pifteenth street. The old man, who oc
cupied the lower fiat of the house, was
eeen by Mrs. Handlos, a neighbor, to be
acting queerly while sitting at the win
dow. Mrs. Handlos went to inform a
mail named Manne, who is the agent of
the property, of the behavior of ihe ol<l
man.
While Marine was going into Capp street
he was surprised to see the body of Mc-
Gulrk shoot through - the air in a down
ward direction from an open window on
the second story. After striking the
ground McGuirk lay unconscious and re
mained in that condition until he died in
thÂ« Receiving Hospital one hour after his
arrival. Dr. Bunnell. who attended him,
pronounced his injuries fatal as soon as
he examined him on his arrival at the
hospital. The Coroner was notified and
fca-3 the body removed to the Morgue.
Those who knew of the old man's mental
condition pronounced his death a cas-e
of suicide.
XIX. I
In the great First Folio a series of I
"Histories" holds the middle place. These
"Histories," chronicle plays, of the type^
familiar to the Elizabethan playgoer, deal
exclusively with the reigns of Englisn
sovereigns. They are not. Indeed, the
only plays of Shakespeare based upon
historical events; In "Antony and Cleo
patra" and "Corlolanus" he follows Plu
tarch even more closely than he does Hcl
inshed in "Henry IV" or "Richard III."
But the Roman plays are grouped by the
editors among the tragedies at the close
of the volume, and, whether this arrange
ment was the result of conscious dis
crimination or not, it can be defended on
the highest esthetic grounds. For the
ten English histories of Shakespeare form
a connected whole. Each play of Jhe se
rles is dependent for its full effect upon
one or more of the others; and the ten
together constitute the real epic of Eng
land.
In this great work Shakespeare had a
twofold purpcrse in mind. He was, of
course, primarily a playwright; his Im
mediate Intention was to put together
pieces which would fill the theater. But
underneath this practical and temporary
aim there was in every case a deeper and
more permanent motive, and It is with
this that true criticism has to deal.
Now the purpose of Shakespeare's his
tories was flrst of all to inspire his hear- |
ers with love of country. Patriotism was
a virtue newborn among the Elizabeth
ans. The loss of the last fragment oi
England's old continental possessions in
the preceding reign had thrown the coun
try back upon itself, and the dread of
foreign invasion proved a closer bond of
union than was ever known before. The
piays and poems of tne great Queen s
reign are full of exulting outDursts of- this
new spirit, but no one nas given it such
eloquent voice as Shakespeare. To him
England, "this lana ot such dear soula,
this dear, dear land," was an object al
most or adoration, "anotner Eden, demi
paradise," and his love ot country Detra>3
him i at times into palpable injustice to
ward his country's enemies.
This spirit of patriotism found an out
let among the Kllzabetnans in a passion
of loyalty to the person or the sovereign
such as to our democratic age and race
sometimes appears exaggerated and even
unreal. That a spirit of gross personal
flattery prevailed among the courtiers
and the courtly poets, especially toward
the close of Elizabeth's reign Is, of course.
Undeniable. But this false note is only
the overstraining of a tone that rang true
in the hearts of the people. To the Eliz
abethans the sovereign was the Incarna
tion of the national idea, the living rep
resentative of England. Not that Eliza
beth nor any monarch of the Tudor dy
nasty could say with Louis XIV. "L'etat
e'est moi." Vast as were the powers of
the sovereign, uncertain and ill defined
as were the checks upon them, there
came a point where these powers ceased,
and the idea of the common weal rose up
against the prerogatives of royalty. 'Â¦ But
ot such a conflict the Elizabethans did not
love to think. They looked back with hor
ror on the intestine wars and the anarchy
that had marked the preceding century,
and they were proud to boast themselves
the sons of the men who had supported
Henry VIII in hla most despotic act3.
with the feeling, unconscious perhaps,
but none the less powerful, that he was
the divine instrument for working out
the nation's destiny. And so, to quote the
quaint words of Shakespeare's contem
porary apologist for the drama, "plays
are writ with this aim, to teach their sub
jects- obedience to their Kingâ exhorting
them to allegiance and dehorting them
from all traitorous and felonious strata
g< Rut if the people owed their 'sovereign
a loyal obedience, the sovereign, in turn,
so Shakespeare held, owed something to
his people. Here, too, Shakespeare is at
one with his age. The Elizabethans no
longer regarded the monarch, after the
old feudal conception, as the cap
stone of the social pyramid. He
was rather the heart of the body
politic, sending the lue blood puls
ing to the remotest extremities; he was
the brain ordering and guiding the action
of the wholeâ not for its own benefit but
for the common weal. There is a deep
meaning in the "exclamation of the soldier
In "Hamlet": "There's something rotten
in the state of Denmark." Denmark's
monarch was a murderous, licentious,
drunken usurper, and when the heart is
sick the whole body is full of sores, and
the time Is out of Joint. Nothing was
plainer to Shakespeare's mind than the
truth that a King, to be a King indeed,
must live not for himself but for his peo
ple And In his series of histories Shakes
peare's second objectâ second only In that
It lies below the surface, for to him, as
to the Btudent of his work to
day, it is of supreme importanceâ is to
present a mirror for mlgistrates; to show
how weakness and wickedness are of In
finitely greater consequence in a monarch
than in a private man; to point out how
little personal sanctity avails to replace
the want of royar will and energy; to
declare that- the highest human powers
united in a King are only fearful instru
ments of evil when not directed to his
country's good; and, finally, to give to hia
conception of the perfect King a local
habitation and a name in Henry V.
Of the ten plays of this series, one,
"Henry VIII," may for our present pur
pose be set aside. It is in a sense the
epilogue to the work, but it was apparent
ly written for some specific occasion far
later than the period in which Shakes
peare's mind was filled with this dramatic
epic t and it is only in part the work of
Shakespeare's hand. Of the rest "King
John" forms the prologue. "Richard II.'
"King Henry IV." the first and Second
parts of "King Henry V," the first, sec
ond and third parts of "King Henry VI"
and "Richard III" the body of the wor'<.
It will be well to study these not in
their chronological order, but rather with
the purpose of discovering in them the
gradual development in Shakespeare's
mind of the idea of the perfect King.
Shakespeare begins at the nadir. Kina
John is the false King. He has no right
to the throne, cither by descent or by
the higher law of fitness. He is con
scious from the beginning of his guilty
usurpation, and this consciousness makes
him alternately tyrannical and vacillat
ing. He boasts at once of his strong pos
session and of his right; he plunders tha
churches of the country to arm himself
against the true heir; he abandons part
of England's possessions to stop Arthur's
title to the whole, and when the true heir
falls into his hands he looks upon him
as a very serpent in his way. and with
passionate appeals to a subject's loyalty
and half-utured hlntlngs at a purpose ha
dare not speak, tempts Hubert to his
murder. But he has not even the courage
of his own evil will, for no sooner does he
see that his murderous designs upon his
nephew have lost him the hearts of his
subjects than he repents and seeks to
throw the burden of his guilt upon tha
executioner of his desires. His one aim
is at anv cost to hold the crown that
he has snatched, and to do this he even
consents to hold it as a vassal of the
papal see. But even this does not save
him. The French, invited into England to
avenge the church of Rome, refuse to re
tire at his bidding, and a desperate monk,
mindful rather of the King's early in
juries than of his late submission,
poisons him in a bowl of wine.
Under such a King heaven itself frowns
upon the land, and it Is only with his
death that a brighter prospect opens. The
English nobles who had deserted the
guilty King rally around hia Innocent suc
cessor, and the hearts of all Shakespeare's
hearers echoed the proud boast of of their
leader.
Now these her princes have come home again.
Come the three corners of the world in arms.
And we shall shock them. Naught shall maka
us rue.
If Kneland to ttself do rest but true.
King Henry VI. was Shakespeare's first
attempt to dramatize history. Of its three
parts the first is admittedly un-Shake
pearean in origin, and bears but few
marks of his revising hand. But in
the others he has gone carefully over the
work of his predecessors, added and cut
away, and finally given us a striking por
trait of the virtuous but inefficient Klcs.
In the words of Henry's far more mas
culine consort:
All h'.s mind 1s bent to holiness.
To number Ave Maries on his beads.
Hla champions are the prophets and apostlea.
His weapons holy saws of sacred writ.
And these were poor weapons for a Kins
of England in that day. Henry becomes
the fool of fortune, and is buffeted to and
fro In the strife of factions that breaks
upon his throne. His faintly breathed
"blessed are the peacemakers' Is lost In
the roar of angry voices. He abandons
hla only friend without a struggle to the
murderous plots of jealous rivals and be
wails his fate with sad. unhelpful tears.
In the stress of the civil wara he actually
begins to doubt his own title to the
throne, and weakly renounces the rights
of his son to secure a temporary peace.
Henry shows to best advantage, indeed,
as an exile, and a prisoner. Then hlÂ«
crown is In his heart, "the crown content
that seldom Kings enjoy," and he thank*
his Jailer for the pleasant hours of his
imprisonment. And in those last years,
when his one desire Is to withdraw from
the world and spend his life In devotion,
he obtains the gift of prophecy, and fore
tells the bloody tyranny of Richard III.
and the accession of the King who should
bring back peace to England. A saintly
manâ and. Indeed, Henry was held by
many after his death to be a saint whosÂ«
bones worked miraclesâ but Shakespeare
speaks the cynical truth by the mouth of
Henry's murderer when he says that such
a King was fitter for heaven than for
earth.
Shakespeare's next creation was or an
entirely opposite typeâ Richard III, the
strong bad King. So much has been
written on this play, the only one of
Shakespeare's histories, by the way.
which still holds the boards, that it is
unnecessary to enter into a detailed
analysis of its chief personage. But there
is one point, perhaps, which has never
been fully developed â Richard's relation
to the land whose throne he has seized.
Richard has undoubtedly many of the
qualities of a great King, bravery and
skill in action, energy of mind and intel
lectual ascendency, the power to bund thÂ«
eyes and even to win the hearts of men.
But 'his gifts are brought to nought by
his all-engrossing egoism. "I am myself
alone," he says, and it is for himself alone
that he lives. He wades through slaughter
to a throne, not because he Is and knows
himself to be the only man who can gufBo
the nation through a sea of troubles, but
because the crown Is the goal of h!s own
selfish ambition. Not even to his dupe
and accomplice. Buckingham. doÂ«s he pr#
tend any desire for his country's welfare:
not even in his last appeal to his soldiers
does he call on them to fight for their
country. He Is not the Cromwell, hnt the
Napoleon of the drama, and his fall, like
Napoleon's, is recognized as a Judgment
of Godâ deposuit potentes.

YOUNG MEN^S CHRISTMAS.
Sermon of the Rev. John Hemphill
Before the Calvary Congregation.
"What the Shepherds Saw in the First
Christmas and What Young Men May See
in the Present One" was the subject of
the Etrmon of Rev. John Hemphill, D.D.,
last evening at the services of the Calvary
congregation.
Dr. Hemphill began by describing the
reception by the shepherds of the tidings
of the birth of Christ. The Lord's angel
came to them in the hills, where they
were tending their flocks, and told them
and they believed and at once spread the
glad news. But at first they were afraid
of it â afraid the news was too good to be
trueâ tut they sought the manger of
Bethlehem to verify the message of God,
and they found it to be true, and they re
alized the power of the Redeemer.
Applying the story of the shepherds and
their acceptance of the news of the birth
of Christ and their search for the divine
Infant to the young men of to-day, Dr.
Hemphill proceeded' to tell how they
should receive God's message.
"First," he said, "If you hear good news,
spread it. as did the shepherds when they
heard of the coming of the Savior; and
if you have received a message from God,
don't keep it to yourself, spread it. Tell
every one you know; tell them, of the
power that has come to you and bring it
home to them.
"And don't be afraid of it. Don't be
afraid of good news 1 or of God's power,
and don't be afraid to acknowledge it and
to be known as one of his followers. And
don't shut your ears to God's message.
God rray be found by listening, by bend
ing the ear for his words of comfort and
by harking to his warnings. And If you
are persuaded that you hear, and that
what you hear is the truth, let it lead you
to action. When the shepheida heard of
the birth of the Savior they rose from
their beds at midnight and went to Beth
lehem that they might see the Son of God
and verify with their own eyes what
they had heard, and they came away sat
isfied.
"If you come to Christ and make a per
sonal trial of him you will not go away
disappcinted. Seek him with your eyes
and your ears, and seek him now, at the
coming of the last Christmas of the nine
teenth century. It Is a time we will never
pee . again, and the opportunity should
not be lost. Seek him; find him, and tako
Christ with you as your personal Savior
on into the years of the twentieth Â¦ cen
tury."

OFFER A GOLI> MEDAI*
TO BOYS' HIGH SCHOOL
Class of '85 Plans for Handsome
Trophy to Be Awarded Bach,
Year.
The class of *S5 of the Boys' High
School has decided to make an annual
offering of a gold medal to be awarded
the student of that school most pro
ficient In the certain branches most close
ly allied to the English course, studied by
the donating class. The first medal will
be awarded in June.
After consultation with Superintendent
Webster, and obtaining the sanction of
the Board of Education, the following re
port has been made by the committee:
We recommend that the method of selecting
the winner be about as follows: ThÂ« general
yearly average of each boy In his Junior year,
10 per cent; middle year, 10 per cent; senior
year, 30 per cent: total, 60 per cent.
The remaining 60 per cent in the determining
of the winner will be computed from special
examinations. !n which we. the members of
'85. with Mr. "Webster's assistance, will mak*
the arrangements and percentages. These spe
cial examinations will be "oriffinal work," and
about as follows: Original problem in mathe
matics. 10 per cent; original problem In science,
10 per cent: total. 20 per cent.
A theme or composition In American history
(to be selected by ourselves) and the same to
be written by the competing members, free
from assistance from any person and will count
for 10 per cent.
Original work in English â to be an essay or
composition upon a passage from Shakespeare
(to be selected by ourselves) and v.hlch the
pupils must, unaided by any other person, writ*
an essay or composition of so many pages, upon
a selected passage or quotation but not frorn,
any of the plays stÂ£!ied at school. 20 per cent.
Deportment. checRS or demerits are not to
count directly or remotely In the percentages.
The last regulation, is entirely consist
ent with the course of the class members
during- their whole course at the. High
School. Because the principal and the
Board of Education would not let the
boys select their own class valedictorian
historian and poet they refused to par
ticipate in a body, and -their diplomas
were passed out to them at the close of
school. -Nearly all of the class members
are now more or .less prominent profes
sionally or in business in this city.
â¢ Circulars have been addressed by the
committee in charge. Dr.-T. <A. - Rottanzi
Edgar D/ Peixotto -and Emlllo Lastreto!
to all- the members of the class invltlnsr
subacriptions to the fund for this year's
medal. '
Its value will not be less than $25. and
a special design Is now v being prepared.
David Meyer, an engineer, employed at
Searle, llayman & Co.'s planing mill on
Fourteenth and Harrison streets, met
death In a terrible manner yesterday. A
belt slipped from the revolving 1 pulley of
the enjine governor. Meyer tried to re
place It without stoppinp the engine. Ho
slipped across thÂ© piston, which forcÂ«d
him into the bed of tho driving shaft. His
Injuries were such as to cause his death
five minutes after his arrival at tho Re
ceiving Hospital.
"When the brtt slipped Meyer was told
by Superintendent Searle to stop the en
gine before attempting to replace It. He
neglected to obey the order and the piston
In its stroke caught nls clothing, forcing
him against the rapidly revolving shaft.
From there he fell Into- the bed In which
the crank dips. At every revolution of
the driving wheel the crank crushed the
unforunate man against the bottom of
the btd. lntticUne terrible Injuries about
his abdomen and hips. His cries attracted
other workmen and when the engine was
stopped he was taken to the Receiving
Hospital. It was said Meyer was under
the Influence of liquor at the time of the
accident. The deceased was a native of
Germany and a widower. He resided on
Eleventh street.

Petaluma Trustees Adopt Conflicting-
Resolutions.
PETALUMA, Dec. 23.â Despite the vig
orous fight against the slot machines in
Petaluma the nickel-winners still remain
in the local, resorts. Some time ago the
City Trustees passed an ordinance licens
ing slot machines, and after this had been
in force for several months the City At
torney reported to the board that they
were acting illegally, that the machines
were prohibited by State laws, and that
the. trustees were liable for licensing
them.
'The Trustees then rescinded the license
ordinance and in its i place adopted
another ordinance legislating against the
machines and instructed the marshal to
remove them. Before he got half started
on this -work the opposition switched the
board again, and at the meeting last night
the Trustees rescinded the order to the
marshal. An ordinance was again pro
posed for licensing the machines, but the
Trustees were about sick of the affair
and dropped It. And the machine men
still reap the profits of their contrivances
unchecked.

ody, was then sung by D. Manlloyd, the
ohoir. orchestra and organ, and then
came the first address, delivered by the
Ilev. Dr. Jacob Voorsanger, of the Temple
Emanu-El.
Dr. Voorsanger first read a number of
telegrams received b^ the president of the
temple from various Jewish congregations
on th Pacific Coast. Tne messages con
veyed congratulations and greetings and
a heartfelt communication came from
Hfnry S^llpman f rom . Frankfort-on-XIai.i
In Germany. Mr. Seligman was one of the
first officer* of the temple and from his
distant home he expressed his Joy at the
semi-cfntennlal of the house, of worship
in which he wa? once a leader.
Dr. Voorsanger's address was entitled
"On the Threshold." and was impressive.
In forceful language, the speaker said:
We bless you out of the house of the Lord.
To be .lew or Christian who is here, peace anl
Ealutatlon to you. We are on the threshold or
a new century. To the elders and to the chil
dren may it be God's will that you be enfolded

Kmanu-Kl ia honor of the semi
centennial of the congregation
wap a remarkable on? from many
points of view. The gathering was one
of the greatoft ever known in Jewish cir
cles in this city, and was made up of men
end \von:en distinguished in professional,
comniorc!al and social circles. A remark
able feature of the festival was the stir
ring aouiiis of the young divine, the Rev.
Dr. S'eplun S. Wise, of Portland, Oregon,
who. in nltading for a united religion,
carried bis auditors to a point of enthu
siasm that gave vent to prolonged ap
p'.ausoâa scene seldom witnessed in a
hiu?Â» rf worship. Addresses were made
by all the leading Jev.ish ministers of the
Pacific Coast and a. special musical pro
gramme war rendered by a picked orches
tra, augmented choir and organ.
Although admission to the temple was
enly by ticket of invitation, hundreds
mere unable to secure seats. The exte
rior and interior of the temple presented a
beautiful appearance, flowers in abun
dance being used with most artistic ef
fect. The walls were covered with ever
green? and lilies, th*> front of the organ
and ark bfing similarly decorated.
The service commenced promptly at 2
p. m.. with the "Jubiiee Overture" of
"VVt-ber. rendered by the orchestra and or
pan. The opening hymn, psalm C, set to
music by Frank Schilling and sung by
Mrs. H. Kelly and the ohoir. was followed
by the reading of prairri XLV, by Cantor
Stark. The thanksgiving psalm of Sulzer.
"Now Thank \VÂ« God With All Our
Heart." was feelingly rendered by Cantor
be with the world and the great brotherhood of
humanity?" â¢ Â¦ Â¦
"Retrospect and Prospect" was the sub
ject of the address of the Rev. Dr. W. H.
Greenburg, the basis of his pleading be
ing for a higher life for men and women
and the betterment of mankind.
A festival anthem, written especially
for the occasion by Cantor Stark, was
then rendered by the composer, assisted
by the choir and orchestra, after which
tn*; closing prayer was pronounced by
Rabbi M. Frledlander. The entire con
gregation then joined in singing "Amer
ica, which was followed by the benedic
tion, pronounced- by Dr. Voorsanger. As
Organist Sabin rendered "The Star-span
gled Banner" the congregation departed
from a service that was among the most
memorable ever held in a Jewish house
of worship on this coast.
HELPEBS OF ZION MEET.
Rabbi Wise Tells of Atrocities Perpo-
trated on Jews at Eoumanla.
The Helpers of Zion Society held a fes
tival celebration last evening in B'nal
B'rith Hall, 121 Eddy street, in commem
oration of the dedication of the temple.
A pleasing musical programme was ren
dered by the choir and orchestra of Beth
Menacham Streisand congregation and
addresses were delivered by Rev. Stephen
Wise, Rev. M. S. Levy and Rev. Isidoi'
Myers. The ancient ceremony of the
lighting of the "hanukkah" candles was
observed, in honor of the tradition that a
flask of oil found in the temple burned
for eight days and nights.
Dr. Wise spoke eloquently on the mis
sion of the Zionists, whose aim was not to
secure Palestine for all Jews, but for
those Jews who were oppressed in many
countries. He. drew a thrilling picture of
tne wrongs wrought on .the Jews of Rou
manla by the government of the country,
a government which owned its own exist
ence to the work of a Jew, Disraeli of
England. No -country has dared to help
the oppressed Jews of Roumania, and it
remained for Zionists to bring them out
of bondage to the promised land. If
Christian lands practiced but one-tenth of
tne. religion they 'professed, there would
be no need of Zionism. Dr. Wise told of
tne work accomplished in the past three
years and that despite the croaklngs of
a few, the Sultan of Turkey was not
averse to Jews living In Ho
felt sure that the coming century would
see the ; solutlon of the great problem. Th->
speaker told of the bravery of an English
officer in South Africa, who captured a
fort with, a handful of men, "because he
had his orders to do so in his pocket."
"The fort we have to capture is that
of Zion, so that the Jews who are cruel
ly, treated may f Jive in happiness. The
world may laugh and tell us that the task
is dangerous and .impossible, but with
God's will we go forth to victory, for we
have His orders in our pockets. The dav
will surely come when the world will ring
with, the news, "The Jews have taken
Zion and it Is theirs."

-Both the Bush-street and Geary-street
synagogues were .crowded yesterday by
the children of. the congregations, the oc
casion being the celebration of the "Han

victories of. Judas, theMaccabeean, and
the dedication of the temple, which had
been polluted. Â¦
At the Bush-street synagague Rabbi
Meyers presided and the children ren
dered a pleasing . musical programme.
At .the Geary-street synagogue Rev.- M

was a distribution of medals and . prizes.

congregation. The superstructure so nobly
built lies In our beloved president and In all
who are carrying on the good work. On the

you In the name of God. May the blessings fur

shall be no more, so that we may perpetuate In.
honor and virtue the good work of our fathers.
I jet us go on in God's name. Amen.
At the close of Da Voorsanger's address
the cantor, choir, orchestra and organ
rendered part of "Weber's jubilee cantata.
The Rev. Dr. S. Hecht of Los Angeles
then addressed the congregation, taxing
for his topic, "The Watchman on the
Tower." He reviewed the history of Tem
ple Kmanu-El, which was a pioneer and
a pathfinder. Temple Emanu-El was in
deed the watchman on the tower. The
speaker reviewed the birth of the re
form movement in Judaism in fJermany,
and dwelt on the growth of the seed in
this free land. The old proverb was
proved by Judaismâ that those who have
sown oft in tears have but prepared a
harvest of joyful gathering. The poet
Mendelsohnn had produced for his coun
trymen civil liberty. The crusade for
liberty started In Germany had produced
remarkable results. The children of
Jew and Gentile went to the same
schools; they went to the same universi
ties, and they had the courage to put
aside Jewish prejudices and leave the
confines of the Ghetto. It was not to de
sert the synagogue or treat with indif
ference the Jewish religion. The move
ment of reform was to stir all to better
conditions.
"You friends, you of the Congregation
Emanu-El," ; said ' the speaker, "have
caught Â¦ the spirit 'of the great leaders.
You have strengthened the work, and it
is your duty to go forth and proclaim tho
cause. Old and young shall be the watch
men on the tower to proclaim 'Behold the
time of mankind's deliverance has come â
the time of happiness for Israel anc nil
mankind.' "
Rabbi Jacob Nelto delivered an address
on "The Future, of the Synagogue." He
asked the congregation to look back and
review the great struggles made by tlios-s
who had made it possible for the Jtws oÂ£
to-day to enjoy so many privileges. They
should hot. fcrget the sacrifices of life
and blood made by the heroes. Too oTten,
alas. Judaism to-day mean* the observ
ance of certain holidays.
' "We must perform," said Rabbi Neito,
"as we profess, and keep alive religious
sentiment. In the synagogue of the fu
ture men and women will come for in
spiration, and not merely to oosorvu cus
tom; in the synagogue of the future they
will derive new knowledge and power, so
that they may lift up the fallen. With
the object of bringing light to those in
darkness and to relieve the weary, the
synagogue of the > future will be a place
of which all Jews will be proud,- for to
be a Jew will mean to be upright and God
fearing and having a desire, to relieve
the sufferings of our fellow men."
â¢ More stirring Â¦words have never been
heard in a house of â¢ worship in this city
than those spoken by the Rev. Dr.
Stephen Wise, who took for -his subject,
"Israel's Fellowship With Other De
nominations." .The address was a, master
ly and .scholarly one, daring in Jts con
ception, and at Its close drew rounds ot
applause. Dr. Wise said, in part:
The subject on which I speak to you Is not
to be found In the liberal thought ot this ce.i
tury but in the word of the prophet Isaiah, who
spoke 25C0 years ago as follows: "For my
house shall be called a house of prayer for all
peoples." Israel leads to-day In the plea for
fellowship, for it believes it to be possible, j We
see the armies of the Lord fighting for no spe
cial purpose. A few months ago the world wit
nessed the powers of the earth banded together
to right a terrible wrong. Under one head the
troops of all clvllzed nations worked with a
common accord. As Important as the -work ot
the Allied Powers Is that of putting down the
Boxerism of the Spirit ." of Evil. â¢ We Â¦Â¦ of
Israel believe that we can ally with other
churches to do this thing. They, how
ever, must be prepared to do certain things as
we are prepared to do to-day. Kach one must
teach that its creed is only a seeking after
truth. ;-..>--;
Â¦ All churches should teach not right belief but
right-seeking, lleliglons must teach the truth
and not falsehoods. Let It not'-be taught in
the Sunday-schools that the Jews were the
killers of Jesus, but that we recognize him as
a KTeat man and a great- teacher and one who
had a mission, to perform. This. Is the stand
to-day of modern Judaism. When some time
Ago a terrible wrong was perpetrated on a
soldier and a Jew and the world stood aghast
It. was -the duties of all. churches to rise - In
their might . and plead for Justice. Recently
in Bohemia a Jew was sentenced to death on
the charge of killing a Christian glrlso that
her blood might be used In a Jewish : service
at the synagogue. Here again all churches
should have risen up and with one accord have
denounced the charge as a vtie blasphemy and
a reproach to all religions. All churches should
be united for Justice and fair dealing. They
should be united to put an end to the double
standard of morality: the silver standard: in
the morality, of meu and the gold standard In
the morality, of , women. They should unite to
stamp out Â¦ the- cross evils which ' exist In; all
large . cities. . I . plead with other churches for.
toleration, peace and mutual respect.' . , . :

and was seized by two Portugnese labor
ers, John Cardoza and Frank Greer, was
yesterday positively identified by Mrs.
â¢Hi A. Stendel of this city as the property
of her husband. Where her husband is
has become a deep mystery.
Mrs. Stendel yesterday saw in The Call
an account of the sloop floating on to
Point Richmond. In the article It wai
announced that B. E. Loomis, resid
ing at 264 Noe street, an employe of the
Santa Fe Railroad, who works at Point
Richmond, was at present In charge of
the yacht and its contents. Mrs. Stendel
called last evening on Loom!s with her
sister, and in broken sobs stated that the
boat was the property of her husband.
She stated to Loomis that she was mar
ried to Stendel by Judge Kerrigan in the
month of May, of this year; that her hus
band used the boat Lulu, so he claimed,
as a trading vessel on the bay. When Mrs.
Stendel was told that the bottom of the
boat was filled with rallroaa Iron and
locks torn from. freight cars, she stated
that her husband had often told her that
the buying of old iron was the most
lucrative part of his trading excursions.
Mrs. Stendel states that her husband was
at the house they reside at, on Sanchez
street, a week ago, and that he was often
away a week at a time. She feels certain
that her husband is drowned, because he
promised that he would be home last
Saturday, and that in the past he was
always punctual. The woman's clothes
that were found in the boat she claims
were hers, and that she left them there,
as she often went out with the missing
man on short excursions on the bay.
Mrs. Stendel does not think her husband
met a violent death at the hands of a
companion, as he always made trips on
the bay without male companions.
To-day the sorrowing woman will jour
ney to Point Richmond, and, after ex
amining the boat thoroughly, Win apply
for letters of administration to secure the
missing man's property. What compen
sation the two Portuguese will have for
securing the boat is not decided on, but
Mrs. Stendel claims that she will pay
the men a reasonable salvage for their
labors.
Among the effects of Stendel's on the
boat was a bank book of the German
Savings and Loan Society, showing a de
posit of J1000 in June, 1897. Up to June
of. the present year no transaction had
been made with the bank with the excep
tion of the recording of the semi-annual
interest. In that month, however, Sten
del deposited $200 more, and, after with
drawing the interest, left a balance in
the bank of $1200.
Whether Stendel was drowned or
whether he still lives Is a mystery. The
case Is exciting great . Interest around
Point Richmond.- A number of the boat-
Ing men who live In the vicinity claim
that it was next to impossible for Stendel
to have fallen over the side of the boat.
The unfinished meal in the cabin indi
cates, they say, that Stendel might have
been called up on deck and there met his
fate at the hands of some unknown mur
derer.
