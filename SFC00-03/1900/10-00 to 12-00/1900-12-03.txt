: begun- He le f tronper than ever, and yet
i? proceeding: with great care and much
diplomacy. He has tasen the country

WASHIXGTON, Dec. 2.â Of the seven

sentenced to be hanged. Up is the suc
cessor of General Joseph Wheeler. His
name is William Richardson 1 ; and a'though
only 17 years old he was one of the cen
tral figures in a dramatic episode of the
Â«i\il war. General Fcrrest. then little
known, even throughout the Confederacy,
in July. 1SC3. received word that the Fed
eral troops under General Crittendcn. who
were at Murfreesboro. Tenn.. forty-seven
miles away, had captured a valuable Con
federate Â«py. He moved quickly, and with
11 <M men romplotejy surprised Crittenden's
force in the early morning, killing many
and taking more than ISO) prisoners. For
rest arrived in time to release the man he
fought, a spy in the Army of Virginia,
known only as Mr. Paul. Paul and his
boy companion had been told only a few
hours before that they were to be hanged
next morning. Richardson was no spy,
but was captured in Paul's company.

Eramatic Episode in the Life of Con-
NEW YORK, Dec. 2.â The Sun has the
following from Washington: The report
of the Interoceanic Canal Commission,
which was handed to the President on
Wednesday, will be transmitted to Con
gress, with a special message concerning
canal legislation, after the annual mess
age has been delivered. In its report the
commission unanimously recommends the
Nicaragua^ route and will give in detail
its reasons for believing that it is the
more practicable. The report treats with
the subject of an interoceanic canal ex
haustively, basing its comments on volu
minuos reports from its field parties. A
statement from M. Hutin, president of
the Panama Canal Company, pointing out
the advantages of the Panama route and
stating the terms on which the company's
property rights and concessions may be
obtained by the United States Govern
ment, will accompany the commission's
report.
ONCE SENTENCED TO DEATH.
Nic&raguan Route.
Unanimous Recommendation of the
CANAX COMMISSION'S REPORT.
To commence such a vast work many
preparations will have to be. made, and
while these are under way all matters
requiring diplomatic action can be settled.
It is believed Secretary Hay has been
given to understand that, notwithstanding
the provisions contained In the constitu
tions of Costa Rica and Nicaragua prohib
iting: "Â«e alienation of land, cession of suf
ficient territory can be arranged so that
once the canal is authorized the work of
construction can begin without delay.
Nicaragua has already denounced her
treaty with Great Britain and is preparing
to take similar action in the case of the
French and other conventions.
The special concern of the diplomats
here arose from the fact that the report
announcing the signing of treaties assert
ed that the conventions contained pro
visions by which the Central American
republics agreed to renounce the treaties
existing between them and foreign gov
ernments which interfered with the ex
clusive construction of the canal bv the
United States. No such provision is con
tained in the agreements, but both -Costa
Rica and Nicaragua have assured the
State Department that they will denounce
the treaties which conflict with the con
cessions to be made to this Government.
"It is manifestly impossible." said a
high official who discussed the matter to
day, "for the Executive to make treaties
setting forth compensations that will be
given to Nicaragua and Costa Rica, when
Congress alone can determine what their
character shall be."
Nicaragua and Costa Rica are of a purely
preliminary character and on the part of
the Central American Governments guar
antee the V'nited States' right to construct
a canal in cas-e of legislation by Congress.
There is no declaration respecting com
pensation, and it is stated emphatically
that the agreements are only to facilitate
building the waterway and insuring the
acquisition of necessary construction
rights by the t'nited States upon the most
advantageous 5 terms.
Nine of the victims of the glass works
tragedy were buried yesterday. Six of
them were small boys, two had not yet
reached manhood and the ninth was but
24 years old.
From 9 o'clock in the morning until 4 in
the afternoon there was no time at which
i the funeral proceesion of some one of the
j young victims of the catastrophe might
j not be seen making its way toward the
I cemetery. Men and women and children
i saw the sad pageants and spoke sorrow
; fully of the tragedy, and sympathy for
I the bereaved was in every heart.
The Church of St. Bonjface on Golden
Gate avenue was crowded to the doors
at 2 o'clock in the afternoon by friends
j of William Valencia, a victim of Thurs
j day's accident. Long before the arrival of
j the funeral cortege the streets became
! filled with people. As the hearse, ap
| proached the crowd divided and the re-
J mains were driven through a long line of
! people, all of whom stood with bowed or
J uncovered head. Covered with flowers, the
j tokens of sympathy from shopmates ana
I boy friends, the casket was carried Into
the church, where the Rev. Father Au
gustine read the beautiful and touching
service for the dead. He referred to the
untimely ending of the young life and to
the awful blow to his paren.ts and rela
tives. The railroad shops, where deceased
was well known, were represented by four
young men who served as honorary pall
bearers. They were II. 'A. Hermann, N.
Knudsen, II. Hoffman and R. Hare. The
body bearers were all from the shop
whf.re young Valencia worked. Their
names are: George Haas, Oscar Kreutz,
Ed O'Brien, Louis Crantz, Herman Scherf
and Joseph Feoster.
The funeral of Thomas J. Rlppon was
conducted at Sacred Heart Church in the
morning, after which the body was in
terred in Holy Cross Cemetery. A solemn
high mass was eald for the repose of the
young machinist's soul and afterward the
last sad rites for the dead were read. The
mass was celebrated by the Rev. Father
Culler., and he had for his assistants two
lifelong companions of the decea'sed.Win
Sullivan and George Monaghan. As the
body was carried into the church
Chopin's "Funeral March" was played.
After the mass had been said the funeral
service was read by Rev. Father Lagan,
and a touching sermon was preachedi The
pallbearers were J. J. Dowling. C. Keenan,
J. F. Tracy. A. J. Brennan, E. J. Morgan!

Funerals of Nine Victims of Thanks-
SORROWFULLY LAID TO REST.
DAT by day more names are
added to the list of those who
perished In the tragedy at
the glass works on Thursday
afternoon. Yesterday while
nine of the victims were be
ing laid in their last resting
places two more succumbed to their in
juries, making a total of twenty-one.
Ellery Crandall died at 11:30 o'clock yes
terday morning at St. Luke's Hospital.
He had suffered a compound fracture of
the thigh and a fracture of the arm, and
for a day before his death he was uncon
scious. The shock received was probably
the cause of death, though the x>ther in
juries would almost certainly have proved
fatal.
The boy was thirteen years old and the
son of Edward Crandall, who is engaged
in the real estate business in San Jose. He
lived with his mother at 1104 Market
street. About four months ago he obtain
ed a position with S. N. Wood & Co; as a
messenger boy. His employers had him
.sent to St. Luke's Hospital after the ac
cident, assuming all expenses. They held
the lad in high esteem and frequently in
trusted him with large sums of money.
Mr. Wood has agreed to bear all expenses
of the funeral, which will probably be
held in Los Gatos. The boy's father, from
whom his mother is separated, arrived
two hours after his son's death.
Eben Pearson Tice died at 3:10 p. m. at
his home, 164 Alabama street. He was a
laborer, employed by the Haslett Ware
house Company, and was '39 years old. He
leaves a wife and two children, the eldest
of whom is but two years old.
Tice lived but a block away from the
glass works and when he saw the crowd
gathering on the roof he joined it and in
the accident which followed he received
Injuries which rendered him unconscious
until his death. His spine was fractured
and he received internal injuries. His
body was removed to the Morgue and af
ter beins viewed by the Coroner's jury
taken to an undertaker's parlors at 2423
Mission street.
Eight more victims, mostly boys, are
still hovering between life and death, and
of that number four will probably die
within the next two or three days. The
total of the dead will almost certainly
reach twenty-five, and It may even exceed
that number.
Fred P. Lilly, Thomas C. Pedler and
Charles Fulton at the City and County-
Hospital will probably not recover, al
though there seems to be .a chance in
Fulton's case. All of them are uncon
scious, and Pedler and Lilly are very low.
There remain fourteen patients at this
hospital who took the terrible plunge with
the collapsing roof of the glass works.
Edward Duggan is still at the Receiving
Hospital, his condition being too Berious
to permit of his being taken home. He
has lost even semi-consciousness and yes
terday he was delirious.
Peter Carroll, brother of the little Stan
ford mascot, Jimmle Carroll, is quite low
at St. Mary's Hospital, although he Is
holding his own fairly well.
Willie Connolly, James Quinn and Ham
ilton Woods are all likely to succumb to
their injuries. Each of the boys is being
cared for at home.
Death of Ellery Crandall and Eben Pearson Tice Raises the Total to Twenty-One;
Eight Boys and Men Are Still in Precarious Condition, and Four of
Them at Least Will Probably Not Recover.

NEW TORK, Dec. 2.â The Sun has the
following from Peking: LI Hung Chang
and Princo Ching, Chinese plenipotentia
ries, are considering a suggestion which
has been made to them that they ascer
tain what the Empress Dowager thinks
of a proposition that tiie court return
from Singan-Fu to Peking under a guar
antee of protection to be given by all
powers. This guarantee, however, would
bÂ» made conditional upon the Empress
taking no part in the government In the
future. Furthermore, she would have to
agree to live at the summer palace or
some other place away from the Emperor,
the choice of such residence, being left
to her, but the powers would guarantee
that she receive an assured income for
the balance of her life. Under this plan
the Emperor would resume the throne
and exercise all the powers that were
usurped by the Empress Dowager and the
latter would agree not* to interfere with
his Majesty.
The first locomotive since the Blege of
the legations ran yesterday from Tients'u
to Peking. The line will not be opened,
however, for general use until about De
cember 15.
PROPOSAL TO THE EMPRESS.
The number of Chinese returning has
been considerably augmented, during the
last few days. Apparently they are
friendly. The provost marshals of tha
various nations are dally informed as to
the whereabouts of returning Boxers, but
only those are arrested against whom
thfere is conclusive evidence of havins

TIENTSIN, Dec. 2, via Shanghai.âPro

representatives of the powers urging the
prevention of tho removal of astronomical
instruments from ' the observatory at Pe
king. Most of the principal instrument?
have been prepared for shipment and la
beled for-Berlln or Paris. The Chinese
themselves do not protest, because, as
members of LJ Hung Chang's staff put it,
their objections would be useless, as
whatever they say or do in the way of
protest only elicits uncivil treatment.
The observatory is universally recog
nized as one of the most interesting sights
In Peking. Most of tho Instruments now
out of place are more than luu years old.
Many of them are magnificent bronzes
and, although not of modern type, may
still be used for the purposes of astron
omical observations.

rumored that Emperor Kwang Su will
return to Peking immediately, and that
the Empress Dowager will follow if tne
reception given him is satisfactory.
Tho Shanghai correspondent of the
Times reports, also, that It Is believed In
well-informed circles that the Chinese
court is anxious to return to Peking, but
he says that such a course would not be

PROTEST TO VON WALDERSEE.
LONDON, Dec. 2.â Count von Walder-
Bee expresses some solicitude, says the
Peking correspondent of the Morning
Post, concerning expeditions into the sur
rounding country, but he believes that
they are necessary and saluatary. The
most of the British officers approve them.
Sir Robert Hart, in the course of a con
versation, said he considered the resent
ment against foreigners to be partly Just
ana the outgrowth of the last sixty years
of treaty relations. He seemed to think
the settlement would be a difficult prob
lem.
Chinese militia forces are being formed
everywhere, and even if the importa
tion of foreign arms is prohibltied a sup
ply will be easily obtained from Chinese
arsenals. A body of 100 American caval
rymen Is escorting some Chinese officers

. WASHINGTON, Dec 2.âAdministra
tion officials continue sanguine that the
Ministers of the powers at Peking will
soon reach a common ground of agree
ment in the demands to be made upon
the Chinese Imperial Government in satis
faction for the - Boxer outrage*. The
State Department is In communication
with thÂ© Ministers and Embassadors of
the United States to the European courts
and advices which have come from them
from time to time lead the officials here
to hope that the powers will be
brought to the position maintained by the
United States in dealing with the Chinese,
viz., that there should not be demands
made upon the Imperial Government
which It is not able to fulfill. Our Gov
ernment has persistently held to this view
In the progress of the - negotiations be
tween the Minister's at Peking, and if the
principle of this contention can be main
tained in the combined note to be handed
to the Chinese plenipotentiaries, a decided
advantage will be had at the start.
The attitude of our Government on this
subject has been made clear to Mr, Con
ger. The meeting between Mr. Conger
and the German and British Ministers
yesterday at Peking presumably was in
compliance with the Minister's latest In
structions from Washington. Nothing has
been heard from Mr. Conger by the State
Department for several days.

element uti both sides and were bound to
prove fatal to the ultimate peace of the
country. He. declared that neither he

Shipping Subsidy Measure to Dis

WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.â The Senate
will be called to order at 12 o'clock to
morrow, but beyond the -probable reading
of the President's message will transact
no business, adjourning till Tuesday out
of respect to the memory. of Senators
Davis and Gear. Senator Allison will
make the announcement of the death of
his late colleague. Senator Gear, and
tnere is hope that Senator Nelson may ar
rive in time to perform a similar service
concerning Senator Davis. These an
nouncements will be preceded by tho
ceremony of swearing in tne new mem
bers, who this year are Mr. Dolllver, who
has been appointed to succeed Senator
Gear, and Mr. Dillingham, who taKes the
place formerly occupied by Senator
itoss of Vermont, and the appointment of
the usual committees to wait upon the
President and the House of Representa
tives. â¢
Mr. Frye expects to get up the ship
ping subsidy bill on Tuesday, and if not
on that day then on Wednesday, and, in
doing this, to have the Spooner Philip
pine bill displaced. This will be the be
ginning of the important work of the
session, and upon the success or failure
of the scheme may depend much of the
future course of proceedings for the en
tire session. In order to accomplish this
result it will be necessary first to get the
consent of the Republican Committee on
Order of Business, and to this end a meet
ing of that committee will be held after
the adjournment of the Senate on Monday
afternoon. â¢
Mr. Frye Baid to-day that he had con
ferred with a majority of the members
o*. the committee, and that he felt assured
he would have no difficulty in securing
the assent to the proposed change. Thus
far there has been no consultation with
Democratic Senators, but the friends of
tho shipping bill do not look for factious
opposition to the taking up of the bill
from that source. A motion to take up
the measure is not debatable under tne
Senate rules, so they are confident of a
majority on a vote if a rollcall should be
demanded. It is probable that a friendly
arrangement will be made with Senator
Morgan, who has the Nicaragnan bill in
charge, that bill being on the calendar as
a special order for the 10th inst.
There is some talk of an effort during
the week to get up the Hay-Pauncefote
treaty In executive session. A movement
is on foot to secure the assent of the
Committee on Foreign Relations to the
abandonment of the Davis amendment to
ti.e treaty for the fortification of the pro
posed canal.
The usual custom of adjourning â¢ over

day during the first week of the session
will probably be departed from this ses
sion. That is the desire of the Republican
leaders now. here, ann there probably will
be no such adjournment.

the latest American girl to wed
a title. She is the bride of
Louis, Viromte de Branges de Bourcla.
â¢whoso title runs back to the Bourbon
Kings, and whose house Is among the
most Illustrious in France. The Vicomte
is not wealthy, nor was Miss Atlee a
great heiress, although a daughter of one
of the exclusive families of Philadelphia.
It was a love match, pure and simple.
The bride Is the younger daughter of
Dr. Atlee, and was educated at Notre
Dame in Paris. She Is pretty, a deml
blonde, with graceful carriage and en
gaging personality. Although of the
bluest of the blue blood of Philadelphia,
the Atlecs go little into society, holding
themselves exceedingly exclusive. They
travel abroad much. The bride's grand
father was a celebrated physician and her
great-great-grandfather a royal judge of
the Province of Pennsylvania.
It was In Paris three years ago that
Miss Atlee met the Viscount. Subsequent
meetings ripened into love, but Dr. Atlee,
who la a rugged republican, refused to
recognize the Viscount's title, Insisting
that If he married his daughter he must
sink rank In the plain gentleman so long
as he should sojourn In America.
Acceding to this, the Viscount, whose
escutcheon bears thirty-five quarterings,
sunk his title and had his cards printed
"Mr. Louis de Branges de Bourcia."
The De Bourcias are well-to-do, but not
rich. The house Is prominent among the
Roman Cathollo families of France. The

Hartzell, who evidently had expected

house late last nipht and a few minutes

He was taken to prison amid protesta

The arrest of Hartzell is the outcome
of a three-cornered youthful love affair.
He courted and married Bessie Showers,

chum. Maud McCormick, and three weeks
ago he eloped with her. Tho girl stole
$35 from a lady she was working for and

make the trip with Hartzell. They went
to Ban Francisco, and two days later he
took the money from her and left her
stranded In the city. She was finally
arrested and brought back here, and the
charge of petty larceny was dismissed.

that the signature was a forgery, but that
the signature of one of the witnesses was,

This Is the first Intimation that the
validity of the first will was to bÂ« at

COGSWELL'S
SUICIDE STILL
A MYSTERY
NEW YORK, Dec. 2.â HJs Grace
the Duke of 'Manchester, the
Duchess of Manchester and Eu
gene Zimmerman, her father,
passed to-day quietly at the Hol
land House, ha/inp decided to rest after
their lively experiences of yesterday un
der the protection of two of Captain Mc-
Cluskey'g detectives.
"We are passing the day quietly and
resting." said the Duke at the hotel, where
he was with Mr. Zimmerman in the mid
dle of the afternoon. They had Juat fin
ished luncheon and were unaccompanied
by the Duchess, who, his Grace said, had
gone out driving with a friend, whose
Identity he declined to reveal.
"I may go out for an hour or so to-day,
but we shall stop at home this evening,"
he said. "My wife and I expect to remain
in the United States until March â that is,
if Mr. Zimmerman will put up with us un
til then," he added, laughingly.
Mr. Zimmerman, who was Landing near,
smiled encouragingly.
"Our present plan." continued the Duke,
"Is to leave here on Wednesday next with
Mr. Zimmerman in his private oar and go
to Cincinnati. We shall probably remain
there a weÂ«Â»k r.r Â»r> and then go South,
visiting Natchez. Â».iiss.. where Mrs. Yzna
pa, my grandmother, lives. Then we shall
go West as far as the Pacific Coast. We
will spend some time in San Francisco.
The length of our stay there is uncertain,
but we shall return Kas>t in time to make
a few Visits before leaving for England In
March."
I asked Mr. Zimmerman If he could give
me the wording of the letters sent to him
containing threats of "egging" the Duke
on his arrival, which he turned over to
Captain McCluskey. who thereupon de
tailed Detective Sergeants Vallely and
Stripp to guard the Duke and his wife
upon their arrival.
"No, I remember scarcely anything
about the wording," he replied. "I paid
little attention to the communications,
but, glancing through them hurriedly I
gained the impression that It was the
work of som<? crank, and so sent them
down to Captain ilcCluskey. That Is all
there is to it, and the incident is closed."
"Yes, there is nothing more to be said
on that subject," added the Duke. "It's
all over."
Captain McCluskey said: "Two letters,
evidently from a crank, making vague
threats of 'egging* the Duke and Duchess
were the cause of my sending Detective
Sergeants Vallely and Stripp to meet them
on their arrival. Need for their services
no longer exists, and they have been with
drawn from their attendance upon the
Duke and his wife. Beyond this there Is
nothing to say. I refuse most decidedly to
make public the wording of the letters."
Eugene Zimmerman, rather of the new
Duchess of Manchester, is a prominent
clubman of Cincinnati, an Odd Fellow, a
Mason, a member of the Loyal Legion
and a member of the Episcopal church.
Mr. Zimmerman is descended from old
Knickerbocker stock. He is good-natured,

the flock at feeding lime their owner
discovered that they emitted peculiar
sounds as they came to the feeding

everv day at feeding time until he figured
that* he had a. register of the whole tur

NEW YORK, Dec. S.â Stacia la only a

has been burled alive. Nobody knows
her last name and her first one was be
stowed upon' the blue-eyed baby by the
policemen of the Greenpoint-avenue sta
tion-house. How she ever llvÂ«d through
such an experience is a puzzle to the doc
tors at St. Catherine's Hospital.
" Yesterday morning some one set astir a
story that there was treasure, perhaps
the loot of' thieves, maybe the hoard of
a miser, in the meadows that stretch
away from Meserole avenue and Guern

each venturing forth by himself, stole
out In the early morning to the strip of
waste, carrying spades. They were
treasure hunters and one of them un

the rust-covered coin of Â« miser, nor yet
jewels and plate stolen by some outlaw,
but just a. round, In. tie bundle of human

many more days on earth.
The particular searcher after hidden
wealth who found the babe had selected
a pile of earth in the meadows that
seemed to have been recently heaped up.
It was loosely thrown together, and as he
thrust in his spade the blade struck some
thing of promise. It felt like a bap and
eagerly the digger plunged in his shovel
again. He leaped back amazed and half
frightened, for a sound, a cry. or a wall,
as of something living, came out Of the

Among the harbor improvements being

The British Admiralty will shortly In

The German Government Is reported to
be negotiating with an Italian syndicate
of shipbuilders to undertake the construc

The reason assigned is that the German

It has puzzled the British Admiralty
why it is that the French Messaglere
Maritime Company has apparently no
trouble with the Belleville boilers used
in a number of Us steamers,' while In
the British navy the same boiler is caus
ing no end of trouble and alarm. The
reason for this Immunity from break
downs Is that the French company has
spare boilers and parts kept at Its home
port for every ship, and after each voyage
about three boilers are lifted out and re
placed with reserve boilers. Evidently
the French company has a system which
the British and other navies are lacking.
The Turkish battleship Mahmoudlch
was ordered last month to proceed to Ge
noa, there to be reconstructed, but ' her
departure has been Indefinitely postponed.
It was discovered when everything was
supposed to be ready and steam was up
that the boilers could only work" up to
five pounds pressure, entirely inadequate
to make the ship manageable. Seven oth
er vessels also Intended to be repaired. at
Genoa are detained on account of the dis
covery of serious defects and it Is esti
mated that their departure will be delay
ed at least four months. The entire Turk
ish navy in its present condition Is evi
dently not a match for the solitary Amer
ican battleship Kentucky. â¢
The coal consumed on board one of the
modern war vessels does not all go . to
ward propelling the ship. In the "Ameri
can navy- about 66 per cent Is used for
propulsion and 34 per cent Is expended for
auxiliary - purposes, such as for. blowers,
distilling pumps, lighting, heating, cook-
Ing and for steamboats. In estimating the
number of knots a vessel Is able to make
with a given quantity of coal In the bunk
ers the distance is approximately reduced
one- third through the numerous other
uses of the coal supply. The British
cruiser Diadem consumes about six tons
dally In running the first four auxiliaries
mentioned and the .' Japanese . battleship
Shikishima uses five tons dally.

The president adds that the "institute committee,"
acting in connection with a committee of the sta
dents, is now engaged in devising some other form of
contest for trials of strength between the freshman
and sophomore classes. What form of contest will
be decided upon he is not at this time able to say; but
he announces in conclusion: "Plans have been for
some time under consideration in the institute for the
establishment of a system of physical culture
which should assist in the upbuilding of the health
of the general body of students rather than
in the development of expensive and time-consuming
athletic contests, and which may help a student of
serious purpose to decide what athletic contests he
mav enter without injury to" health or to scholarship.
Commenting upon the subject the president says
there are two objections to the cane rush as practiced
at the institute either of which is sufficient to banish
i* from college sports. In the first place, it is not a
game of skill and cannot be played* under definite
rules; in the second place, when carried on in an in
stitution where the classes are so large as to involve
400 or 500 students in the fray the danger of acci
dents is too great to be tojerated. For those reasons
that form of contest will be prohibited at the institute
hereafter.
In describing the contest and the accident the presi
dent says: "The can-, which is a strong oak stick
about four feet, long, with a knob at each end, was
placed in the custody of the freshmen. Six or eight
of the strongest men in the class grasped it firmly.
Around these a small circle of the most athletic fresh
men was formed with hands clasped and facing out
ward. Concentric circles of freshmen were added un
til perhaps 150 had been formed into a compact cir
cular mass. Outside of this guard, formed to defend
the cane, forty or fifty freshmen operated in detached
wings to interfere with the sophomores in their at
tack. These latter formed at the other end of the
grounds in two flying wedges which simultaneously
flung themselves upon the mass of freshmen in the
effort to break up their formation and reach the cane.
After the first three minutes all that one could dis
tinguish was one mass of struggling students., At the
end of fifteen minutes a pistol shot gave the signal
for a cessation of the struggle; the number of
hands on the cane was counted and the class to which
tlie larger number belonged was declared winner.
Young Moore was an unusually strong fellow. For
this reason, and on account of his interest in the cane
rush, he was chosen aa one of those to hold the cane.
At some time during the struggle he was caught in
such a way as to receive a powerful wrench, which, as
the autopsy showed, dislocated his neck. His death
was probably instantaneous. These, so far as I have
been able to learn them, are the facts."
\^ OVED by the dreadful accident which resulted
/ \ in the death of a student of that institution
* *at the recent cane rush between the sophomore
and freshman classes and by the wide publicity given
to more or less exaggerated accounts of it, President
Prichett of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
has issued a statement concerning the accident, to
gether with an announcement of the policy of the in
stitute in dealing with such sports.

The rebuke of a friend is kind, but this is not even
a rebukeâ it is an amicable observation. The Call
acknowledges gratefully the . kindness of Oakland's
people, and feels that it is minding its own business
when it ventures to advise them along the lines for
the best development of the many capacities of their
city. .i
The location of Oakland is 'one of the' finest, in the
world. It seems to an unprejudiced, non-resident. and
observing friend that if fife would pool her issues and
strike for the full exploiting of her capacities as a
residence and a commercial city all things would be
added unto her. This means parks and a harbor,
Just then the unpleasant discovery was made .that
the taxable property annexed does not nearly yield
the additional cost of watching and tending it, and
the result has been a cramped exchequer and an
altogether unsatisfactory fiscal condition. As is too
often the case in the presence of difficulties, the mem
bers of the city" government have given to strife the
time they owed to business, and an administration
which went in nearly two years ago really desirous of
doing its duty is approaching the close of its term with
a record for inefficient honesty only. It is not for U3
to gird at Oakland, but really the soil is newer and
the field better there than in San Francisco for bene
ncial administration. 'Phis port needs more room for
transaction of business that comes and goes by water.
Oakland has two miles of water front that offers splen
did opportunities. It is on the harbor which the Fed
eral Government has been creating and improving
since so long ago that its beginning has almost passed
out of history into tradition. If the city government
would awake from some of its dreams of "Greater
Oakland" and "Oakland City ; and County" arid do
something to promote 1 the speedy occupation of that
water front by deep water trade it would relieve the in
creasing pressure on the wharf facilities" of Sati Fran
cisco and do something: that would bring more than
map greatness to, Oakland herself. This city has no
commercial jealousies against Oakland. We feel the
spirit of partnership in her progress and prosperity
and desire to see the members of her government quit
bickering and do business.
Equipped with this new pylactery, the people pro
ceeded to stretch it over contiguous territory and an
nexed various outlying spaces. Having become
"Greater Oakland"' the good city sat down to enjoy
the era of expansion, only to have her dream inter
rupted by importunate demands from her new posses
sions for street lights, police, schoolhouses, street
pavements, sewers and all the other muniments, con
veniences, necessities and luxuries which go with
"Greater" cities.
OUR neighbors in Oakland are the victims of a
"Greater" fever. Their charter was one of
those improved schemes" for municipal govern
ment and was regarded as up-to-date in cut and fit.
GREATER CITIES.
â¢;-r C depehder.t. and are apt to rise and fall with their
.governing centers, â¢hey" also are quiet at the 1 >-
rtient. Otherwise there is nothing in local trade call
ing for especial mention.
The feature of local trade during the week was the
combining of the salt works about the bay into the
control of the Federal Salt Company, and a conse
quent jump in the price of salt from 95c to $2 per bag.
Otherwise there were few fluctuations in merchandise.
In fact; trade in San Francisco is unusually smooth
end featureless. The wholesale merchants report an
unvarying monotony of liberal sales, easy collection?
and good profits. Shipping continues to lead in point
of activity and profit, ?nd those who own vessels have
certainly nothing to complain of. Their only appre
hension is how long the boom in sea transportation
will continue. Oil men are close on the heels of the
shipowners, and the industry is progressing more
rapidly than. at any other time in its brief local his
tory-: Sales on the San Francisco Oil Exchange are
lieavy.ind steadily increasing, and reports of strikes
are coming in from all over the State.
;; Farm produce is rather quiet than otherwise and
prices show iittle change from day to day. This is
the dull time Â©I the year for most products, especially
cried fruit, which is no\. extremely dull. The other
riarketR. .such as provisions, hides, wool, etc., sympa
thize closely with the Eastern markets on which they
Wall street was quieter last week, though there was
ffood investment purchasing by the public, especially
when concessions could be obtained. In fact, the
public. form an important factor in Wall street now,
whereas for the past year they have been conspicuous
by their absence.
The condition of the leading staples confirms the
testimony of the bank clearings. The holiday trade is
reported brisk, and boots and shoes record a small
advance, as against a- recent depression of several
Tnonths. The advance is accompanied by large orders
from many points.. Dry good, too. are expanding,
; th.pugh slowly and irregularly. The wool trade is
reepverihg from the recent heavy failures and sales for
the week gained about 500.000 pounds, though prices
for roost descriptions are still weak. Cotton goods
are row reported very firm, with a number
tif;; advances. The iron and,, steel trade is
tteadily working around into firmer condition â
<nders: for finiFhed products are increasing, the rail-
Tos<is.: are. liberal purchasers and small advances in
quotations are reported here and there. In addition
Â¦a number of idle furnaces are going into blast. The
railrc>ad earpings sho*- a slight gain over 1899. The
hardware and lumber trades are reported flourishing.
\\ heat, however, continues the mule in the procession
and drags at weak prices, due to the large supplies all
txvtx the world and good crop prospects.
* I 'HERE. is no question that business is improv-
J; ing: From all points in the country commercial
. * .reports are to this effect. The best reports con
liirue.to come fr6;m the South and West, as unseason
able .weather in the East tends to check the
seasonal. distribution of goods. The bank clearings
>t:ll -show material gains Over 1899, those for the past
\vfek increasing .24. per cent. and. what is more, all
Urge cnies except Minneapolis increased, the clear
ings; for Pittsburg, the center of the iron and steel
i!i:du$tr>v gaining 27.1 per cent. Not for a long time
have these clearings shown such gains, though ever
sinceVthe election the tendency has been upward, as
iV yfis downward, before. As the bank clearings are
generally accepted as the best barometer of trade the
Â¦ronckisiqri that the country is again on an increasing
wave <rf prosperity, is irresistible.

* I consider that Mrs. Roos is the luckiest
woman in this town. â¢ She lost a magnifi
cent pin valued at $1000 at the opera and
early the next morningâ while traces of
tears yet remained on her faceâ she had
it returned to her with the compliments
of the honest finder.
When Mrs. Roos discovered the loss of
her pin she was just preparing to step
Into her carriage. With her husband
she returned at once to the auditorium,
and while Mr. Roos furnished a match
illumination. Mrs. Roos and the theater
attaches searched diligently under each
seat. But to no avail. Then the theater
was swept up, but still no pin, and so the
lady went disconsolately home to weep
over. the loss of her Jewel. Maybe though
she was not glad when the next morning
a messenger brought a tiny box, and
within, nestling in a cover of tissue paper,
she saw her pin sparkling.
The finder's name, I believe, was Mrs.
Pike, and I understand that the vase,
with its wealth of costly blossoms, that
went back 'Â¦ with Mrs. Roos' grateful
thanks, cost the loser just $100.

comes in. On Monday last ex-Minister

spoke to the pupils.
"How shall I address the students?"
said the ex-diplomat to Principal Brooks
as he stood in the auditorium facing a
bewitching bunch of blooming girls.
"Shall I call them young ladies?"
. "Call them girls," said Brooks.
'"Very well," said Barrett, "but I really
would like to call them sweethearts."
And that is how It came about and that
is the simple fashion in which Barrett
with one fell swoop captured several hun
dred palpitating girlish hearts.

The Burro Was Killed.
According to a report received tha

Mexican Railway, a rather unusual Inci
dent happened on Friday, while th* ex

seven miles from the city, when the train
was running: at a high rate of speed, tha
engineer, upon rounding; a curve, saw a
man ridlr.sr a burro on the track but a
few yards in front of the efiglne. The en
gine struck the man and burro, throwing
them into the air. Upon the arrival of ths
train at Vera Cruz It was discovered that
the man who was rUUng the burro at thÂ«
time of the accident was reposing on tha
little platform built on the front of Eas
lish engines. He was unhurt, bat In a
very intoxicated condition, his thrllllnr
experience evidently not having: resulted
In sobering 1 him up. The burro wu dis

GREAT BRITAIN has found in the Transvaal
a foe as tireless and as fearless as the guerrillas
of Spain, that in the early years of this century
wore out the strength and mocked at the strategy oi
the armies and the generals of the great Napoleon.
The Boers have surrendered their cities and their
farms; they have left their wives and their children to
the invader, but their arms and their horses they have
kept, and by means of them are harassing the British
and all who favor the British from one end of the
country to the other. .'-,?.
The Westminster Gazette recently published a map
marked so as to show places where the Boers have
made attacks since the first week in October, and the
map Was spotted all over. Not a single important
section in the Transvaal or Orange River colony is
free from disturbance. In commenting upon the
showing made by. the map the Gazette says:
Take the belt of country Btretching from Mafektng
to Barbertonâ some 350 miles as the crow fliesâ and note
how every Important place, and many others besides,
within that belt Is a center of disturbanceâ Ottoahoop,
Lichtenburgr, Rustenburg, . Krugersdorp, Johannesburg,
Middelburg, 'Belfast. Or, asrain, take another belt of
country from Barberton to Philippolle in the southwest
of (he Orange River Colony, some 500 miles in length,
and you encounter opposition at Carolina, Ermelo,
Bethel, Standerton, Platrand (where the railway was re
cently cut), Vrede, Reltz, Harrismith, Ficksburg (held by
the Boers), Ladybrand, Wepener, Dewetsdorp, Jagersfon
tein. Take yet another line from Vryburg. in Cape Col
onyâmidway between Kimberley and Mafekingâ to Vry
heid, in the -southeast of the Transvaal, a distance of
nearly 400 miles, and you have fighting - going on at
Bloemhof, Hoopstad, Bothaville, Kroonstad, . Venterg
burg, Senekal. Bethlehem, in the hilly triangle formed by
Reitz. Vrede and Harrismith, in the Â¦ Drakensberg
passes, Utrecht and Vryheid. A glance at the line of
railway from the Orange River to Pretoria, and thence
to Komati Poort in the far East, and from, Volkarust in
the northern apex of Natal to Johannesburg and Potc.hef>
stroom, will show how our lines of communication are
daily threatened by the enemy. . ..,â¢-Â¦ ..' :',
To crush an opposition of that kind by- military
force it will be necessary to resort to what has become
known as Weylerism. From that the British naturally
shrink. A demand has arisen in London as well as
in Cape Town for a resort to statesmanship instead of
war. One of the difficulties in the way of conciliation
is that as soon as a Boer becomes conciliated and
settles down on his. farm the guerrillas raid his place
and kill him as a traitor. The problem is a difficult
one. but it is certain the solution of it is not to be
found in Weylerism. Such tactics have been' tried in
many lands and many ages, and always they have
failed. The indomitable Boers are not to be conquered
by anything Kitchener can do. If Great Britain have a
single wise statesman in her councils now is the tims
for her to listen to him.
THE INDOMITABLE BOERS.
BY SALLY SHARP.
It is going to be a crowded and a busy session. The
river and harbor bill alone will take up much time,
for it is expected to provide larger appropriations
than ever before in our history. The Republican
steering committees will have to exercise a great deil
of skill they succeed in carrying through even the
measures we have named. In fact some Republican
leaders, including Senator Frye. are quoted as saying
an extra session is inevitable. We need not, however,
face that fear just yet. The Democratic opposition is
composed mostly of Southern men, and they are likely
to be on their good behavior at this session for fear the
Congressional apportionment may be made upon the
basis of voters, and not of population. There is such
a thing as making the country tired of too much
South in Congress, and consequently there may be
no violent opposition to needed measures.
Where the session is so short and the number of
important measures so great the minority will have a
good deal of power, for by making a fight on every
measure that arises the business of Congress may be
delayed despite all the efforts of the majority to
hasten it. Consequently the attitude of the Demo
crats toward the leading measures of the session is a
matter of great public interest. Should they under
take a determined obstructive policy in opposition to
every part of the programme of progress they will
undoubtedly be able* to defeat much of it. To their
action, therefore, close attention should be given, so
that the public may have a clear understanding of
Democratic responsibility for the defeat or postpone
ment of any important measure.
Among the important issues of the time are the re
duction of the war tax, the merchant marine bill, the
Nicaragua canal bill and an. immigration restriction
bill. The canal bill and the shipping bill are now
before the Senate. The day and hour when the Sen
ate is to take up the canal bill is, in fact, already fixed
by action taken at the last session; and it has been
announced that Senator Frye intends to call up the
shipping bill as unfinished business. Those two meas
ures; therefore, are in good positions, and unless some
unfortunate conflict arises between their supporters
we may reasonably expect the passage of both.
Our dispatches from Washington are to the effect
that the Republican leaders, realizing the impossibility
of passing all desirable measures at this session, will
deal first with measures of imperative urgency and
leave for future consideration those which are not
absolutely necessary. It thus becomes a matter of
interest to the public to learn as early as possible what
issues are to be taken up and what are to be post
poned. It is quite probable the country may differ
from Congress as to the comparative importance of
various measures, and. therefore, pressure may have to
be exerted by the press and by boards of trade and
similar organizations urging action upon measures
which mipht otherwise be set aside.
The routine appropriation bills will have to be
passed, and the country also expects this winter a river
and harbor bill, carrying large appropriations.
Another matter of urgency is the army bill, for our
present military establishment terminates by law on
July 1, and unless a new law be enacted the army will
on that date shrink to very narrow limits. Finally
Congress is expected this winter to pass a Congres
sional apportionment bill, so that the various State
Legislatures may know how many districts they are
to establish in apportioning their States.
/^^â¢ONGRESS assembles to-day for the short ses
( sion with' an amount of work before it which it
can hardly hope to c&mplete. Between now
and March 4, when the session closes, the holidays
are to intervene, so that there will be hardly more
than sixty working days for the transaction of busi
ness: and so numerous are the important measures
before the two houses it is fairly certain that some of
them will have to be postponed to the next session.

Point of View.
The Maurice Grau grand opera season
is a thing of the past for this year at
least. This morning at 1 o'clock the com
pany .left San Francisco en route to Den
ver in a special train of nineteen cars.
Immediately arter last night's perform
ance of "Higoletto" there was bustle and
hurry to catch the train, jn early all thr
scenery had been loaded on the cars dui
irir the daytime, and half an hour aft^r
midnight the train v.-as ready to pull
out.
Manager Grau was interviewed Just be
fore his departure for the train. He
seemed in good humor, and had all kinds
of nice things to say about San Francisco.
"I wish to bid farewell to San Francisco
people through your paper," he said. "J
have had a most successful season here,
and have done far better than I ever an
ticipated. I do hope the San Francisco
people are well pleased with my company
and are perfectly satisfied. I know of
no city outside of New Vork where grand
opera is so well patronized as here. You
must remember that we have played three
weeks this time, and the business improv
ed every night."
When asked if the season of grand op
era was a linancial success, he said:
"1'es; I have done very well. The only
thing that surprised me was that we
did bigger business with "Die Walkure"
than any oilier performance." .
Asked if he intended coming here
again next year ne said, should he de
cide to rro outside of New York, San
Francisco would be the first city he would
think of visiting. Ho said he did not
know whether Mme. Melba would be with
him next season or not.

FROM SINKING SHIP
Norwegian Bark Bolivia Becomes
Waterlogged, but the Crew Are
Saved by a Steamer.
NEW YORK, Dec. 2.â The Lamport and
Hall line steamer Gibers. Captain Braith
waite. which arrived to-day from Brazil
ian ports, brought Captain Haakonson and
fourteen seamen of the Norwegian bark
Eolivia. which was abandoned at sea. The
Bolivia left Darien November 20 for Hull.
On the 26th she ran into a gale lasting
forty-eight hours. She labored and
strained oadly, causing her to sp-lng a bad
leak. Heavy seas also boarded the vessel,
and when the storm subsided she was
waterlogged. All hands were kept at the
pumps, but in spite of their efforts the
water steadily poured In from the bow
and stern, where her seams opened. On
the 29th the steamer Olbers was sighted
ar.d stood by while the crew abandoned
the bark and took all hands safely aboard.
The Bolivia w*s then Â«=een to be fast set
tling in the water.
Professor Moore contends that the deci
sion was a commendation instead of con
demnation of storm warning?. The^ bu

Insurgents Capture Town of Chngrss,
Being Subsequently Driven

KINGSTON. Jamaica, Dec. 2.â Advices
to-day from Co!on by the Royal Mail
steamer Don indicate the continuance of
considerable rebel activity in all quarters
of Colombia. Last Wednesday a strong
force of insurgents captured the town of
ChagTes, fifteen miles from Colon. Eight
hundred Government troops were sent im
mediately to relieve the town, and shnrp
fighting followed. The Government forces
lost heavily, but the rebels were compelled
to retire.
The insurgents were also reported to be
attacking Porto Colombia and Snbinalla,
to which points Government reinforce
ments had been ordered. The martial law
was being Ftrictly enforced in Colon and
a large number of people had been im
prisoned under suspicion.
The V. S. S. Bancroft and the British
second-class cruiser Intrepid were at
Colon when the Don left.

seemed to be ail right, but they could not

Seme young chicKens were hatched from

Mr. Woodruff says that on the night of
November 10 a band of six Indians, three
men and three women, a remnant of the
Xashult-Ple band of the Chiricahuas, who
did not surrender with Geronlmo and who
have been marauding the outlying Mor
mon settlements In Mexico for several
years, raided a Mormon ranch and carried
off a lot of plunder. Two men took up
the trail the next day and came upon the
Indians in a deep canyon and In the fight
that ensued one Indian and two squaws
were killed, the rest escaping to the moun
tains with the stolen stock. Woodruff and
three other men joined the pursuers next
day, but did nothing more than to bury
the dead Indians,

"^^ Grau people took their
leave of San Francisco,
with expressions of utmost good-will on
both sides.
The theater retained the afternoon's
decorations for the Elks' memorial ser

weeping willow at the departure of the
sweet singers .from our midst.
The house might have been better filled,
but the enthusiasm has hardly been more
marked at any performance given during
the season, the singers receiving a perfect
ovation.
Three stand out prominently from the
castâ Saleza. who was in beautiful voice;
Scotti, who gave the finest Rigoletto
we have heard here, and Suzanne Adams,
whose Gllda suggested frequent compari

WASHINGTON. Dec. 2.â Five hundred
delegates are in Washington to attend the
twenty-seventh annual convention of the
Woman's Christian Temperance Union.
whose regular business session begins to
morrow. The indications are that the
conv ntion will be one of the most profit
able in the history of the organization.
To-day a preliminary meeting was held,
presided over by the national president.
Airs. Lillian Stevens of Maine. Mrs. J.
R. Barney of Round the World Temper
ance Jlissiipary Workers for the W. C.
T. U. delivered her annual sermon. In
Â¦which she referred to the night of the
Israelites under Moses to Jerusalem. She
likened the promised land 01" the He
brews to the promised land of the twen
â¢ tieth century now cawninE for the W. C.
i T. Ui workers. "Our Jericho." she said.
] "Is about to aawn upon us. It Is the com
ing century when efforts should be
redoubled and aggressiveness should be
i the watchword lor increased activity In
abolishing the saloon and stamping out
the hcuor evil."
One of the most important features of
the convention will be a Giscuasion of the
army canteen. Mrs. Ella M. Thatcher,
national puperintendent cf the sailors'
and soldier.-?' department, who has this
matter in charge, will offer a resolution
condemning the canteen. Mrs. Thatcher
| has visited all thf> army headquarters
; and soldiers' homes of the country, ex
i aminlng the workings of the canteen thor
] ouglily. She rteclaicfl that there is a
remarkable difference between the old
pololer al the home at Marlon. Ind..
! where there is no canteen, and other
\ po ts. The men are belter mentally and
| physically, she said.
Mrs. Helen Bullock of New York, now
| superintendent of the Social Purity

j delivered an address to-night on the sub
ject of temperance. She said the W. C.

Oakland doubted. the local team yester
day morning on the Oakland grounds in
the matter of errors, made but five hits
to Frisco's nine, yet won out the game by
a 6core of 6 to 5. The reason of It all
was a bouquet of hits In the third inning,
when Fitzpatrick was rattled for fojir
starry stickers and the local team for a
few costly errors. This netted six runs
for the Dudes. The run makers were
Francks, Held, Hutchlnson, Borchera,

A keen northerly wind. blew across the
links and rendered the lack of a club
house severely apparent. Several friends,
however, accompanied the contestants
round the course. The fair green Is very
rough, being covered with tussocky grass,
which gives bad lies for the ball. The
putting greens are of earth mixed with
clay, but their rough and uneven surface
renders putting difficult. Consequently
low *core!Â« are not to be looked for. Hor
ace Rawlins and his brother Harry were
not at the Sausalito links yesterday, but
will visit them next Sunday.

Tho game at Recreation grounds was
interesting for its own sake and the fanat
ics who saw the last sad rites went home
with tears In their eyes that the season,
was over. The Dudes found Knell to their
liking for five innings, after which Krug
was put In the box. Heine proved very
strong until the eighth inning, when the
Dudes discovered a curve or two and shot
a brace of runners over the plate.
The first inning brought a run to both
teams. In the second Oakland took the
lead by earning a tally, but this was more
than counterbalanced In the fourth by a
couple of- Frisco chalk lines. But the
fourth was the decisive inning of the
fame. Hutchlnson, Mosklman and Bow
man made a fine display of Brummels on
the sacks. Schwartz thought he would
win sudden fame by catching "Hutch" off
guard, so he threw to Reilly. but the ball
went a few miles south of the third base
man, Hutchlnson and Mosklman crossing
the rubber. Later on Bowman scored on
the throw-in of Lohman's out. Thin gave
the Dudes an advantage which they kept
through the game. The score:
The windup of the season was devoid of
interest aa far aa championship honors
or a pennant were concerned. For a month
or more Sacramento led all the other
teams by so safe a margin as to put a
close finish out of the question. That
team still retains the championship and
the pennant. San Francisco finishes sec
ond, Stockton third and Oakland fourth
and last.
The California Baseball league season
of IWQ closed yesterday afternoon at the
Recreation grounds in this city and at Oak
Park In Sacramento. Oakland and San
Francisco gave the linal diamond per
formance here, Sacramento and Stockton
In the Capitol City.
RUBE LEVY had a chanca to dis
tinguish himself yesterday after
noon at Recreation grounds by
a deed that would have caused
his name to linger in the minds
of fanatics and small boys all during tho
winter intermission of baseball. It was
the last same of the season and until
April cf 1901 Rube would have been the
unworking king.
All that Mas required of him was a
home run or something less anarchical.
Pabst. Schwartz and Fitzpatrick were on
the bags, the inning was the eighth, the
score 5 to 3 In favor of Oakland, and only
a single death. Rube tried hard enough,
but he signally failed. A high drive to
Held ended .Levy's career and a quick re
turn to the plate, when Pabst was caught
coming- home, completed the death of
the local team's chances of winning. Har
rjs says ne will not fine hl9 left fielder,
but Rube is sad over toppled opportu
tunltles. In the next inning the Dudes
rubbed It In, the final score reading 7 to 'i.

A WINS THE STAKE
Tfce first games of the handball tourna
ment arranged by the Olympic Club were
played in the big court yesterday. T':#
first round was practically played off,
leaving a bye, drawn by Sullivan of the
Olympic Club, to be played to-night.
There were seven entries, only one of
which was from the Olvmi>ic Club â
Charles Suilivan. The others were ama
teur players who have been playing in the
various courts of the cÂ»ty and unattached
to any club. All, however, are well known
handball players.
The ru:es of the tournament require
that every player snail play with every
other player, the winner of the greatest
number of games to be declarcu the win
ner of the tournament. The games are for
the first two out of a possible three.
The tirsÂ»t game of the afternoon was be
tween Maguire and Curley, both strong
players. Magulre outclassed his man and
beat him In two straight games by 21 to
11 and 21 to 13.
The second game was between Lenihan
and Harlow. Lenihan was new to the
Olympic court, but he found no difficulty
in beating Harlow by 11 to 11 and 21 to ii.
Harlow showed lack of Judgment in plao
lng. Time after time he sent the ball rigl.t
into Lenihan's hand iÂ».nd he himself waa
in a great many instances responsible for
LenJhan's kills*
The game of the afternoon was between
White and Collins. White is considered
one of the coming players of the city and
Collins is close behind him in rank. Col
lins is a heavier man and plays a stronger
game, which accounted for his wlnaitig
yesterday. White did not play his game
or he would have won, for he plays with
rare judgment and precision. It took three
games to decide, the scores being Whiteâ
18, 21 and 19; Collinsâ 21. 15 and 21. In the
last game White picked up and played
more nearly to his urm. It took four
hands to raise Collins from 19 to 21 and
a winning.
The tournament will go on to-night,
commencing 1 at 8 o'clock.

On election day Bendel and Mason won
by the narrow margin of four points.
Yesterday Henderson and Schuster re

Tanforan Park closed on Saturday after

Racing Secretary Tozer's work, and the

has a decidedly catchy look, indicative of
more good things In store. The different

The attention of horsemen is called to
the fact that the Antrim stock farm year

performers on the turf were bred at this
establishment, and the youngsters to be

An effort will be made to Induce the
Oakland officials to shorten the term of
suspension existing against Bullman. In
view of the fact that all circumstances
point to the fact that Coburn was also at
fault, It looks like a circumstance where
leniency might be shown.

after having a few drinks became involved
in a dispute with the bartender and his

Frank Lennon of Vallejo called at the
Morgue yesterday morning with the ob
ject of seeing the body of the man who
committed puicide Monday In the Dewey
House by shooting himself. He thought
the man might be a friend of his. K.
"Walsh, who had been working recently In
the navy yard but had disappeared. He
said that the description of the man
which was published in the newspapers
corresponded with that of Walsh.
Lennon was told that the body had been
pent to the city undertaker, Joseph Ha
gan. 1707 Sacramento street, to be pre
pared for interment in the potter's field.
He called there, but was informed that
the body had been Interred Saturday. He
was asicd to t\iÂ»H again to-day, when an
order might be obtained to exhume the
body for his Inspection.
Lennon is convinced that the body is
that of Walsh from the fact that the' de
scription of the three Spanish coins found
In his pockets were recognized by a lady
friend of Walsh in Vallejo.
Walsh went to Manila as a Foldler, and
after being paid off there started In busi
ness. When he returned he had $2500. but
instead of going into business here he got
a Job in the navy yard.

is the offspring of the famous dog Tloxy
Savage Taylor and the prize bitch To

.. ;Ha<J there been a relnspectlon of some
f the rompanies in this city it Is very
likely that some of them would have been
foend very near the point of being classed
Â» - Inefficient. One of theÂ«e. which, under
thf iaw. should not have shown up with

below the twenty-five mark.

Inefficient, is very marked.
'--. In this State there is but one Inspection
a year, and for the occasion there is a
Flurrying arctir.d to get enough men to
rntke a.i-howlnjr so that there may be an
attractive paragraph in the inspector's* re-
X^rt. According to the report of the In
ppecter jrener&l of Massachusetts, a dif
ferent system prevails In that State. He
i-.otes that some weak companies were re
fficpticted find three of them disbanded. In
thi?. matter he says:
. If. the complaints that have been heard
durinr the recent inspection of the Sec
ond. Brigade are well founded, the field
officers are not culpable to the degree of
being too perfunctory, as eome of them
have not given any one a chance to say
fvn that about them.
It is apparent to this department that field
cfrWrs officially visiting company armories
do not do their Â»hole duty. ThÂ» visit* are too
r>er?unctory- Comj>anleÂ» have been fouDd In

The inspection developed in a marked
<lc\gr.ee, in both the Tim and the Fifth
Tiegiznents. the apparent lack of interest
on the part of the majors of the several
I attalions. . in connection with the com
l-iinses in the battalions. This has had a
j-erioun effect en the line officers, the non
ewmmifsioncd officers and on the men
themselves. A spirit of indifference seems
to permeate both organizations and it is
evident that as the Held otHcern are negli
gÂ«nt. so the line officers become careless.
and as th* carelesFnehs of the line officers
is noted, the ncn-coms are affect ert, and as
tl.ese ehow a want cf zeal, fo do the men
In tho ranks. Company I at LJvermore
complained that since :ts organization laet
A-prll It has not been visited by the major
ot the battalion to which the company is
attached, and complaints of a similar
nnturt were heard from companies.
The attention of the superior officers will
be called to this matter with the possible
result that the delinquents will be read a
lecture that may result in betterment in
future. Possibly there may be a para
graph In the report of the inspector of the
trhor of one in that of Brigadier General
James L. Carter, inspector g-eneral of the
Massachusetts State Militia, filed on the
Cf last month. He eays:
The muster :Â»t Napa was not what was
expected, but at Livermore the company
made a good showing as to numerical
HxeAgth. As a whole, the inspection of
the fcitth Infantry showed that physically
the men in the different companies are
all very acceptable, and as to uniform
and adjustment of belts but very little
Â«.ould be discovered to Invite adverse crit
icism. There w;i*5. however, in a number
of companies evidence that there had been
a. lack of instruction in the drill tactics
and the manual of arms and that there is
room for improvement, which the officers
may be able to bring about by careful
f-iudy and by giving the men practice.
The drilling of tne companies by the non
commissioned officers was. as a rule. poor.
In the reorganization of the regiment a
number of new men were Introduced into
the ranks. The inspection demonstrated
that there is need of instruction by those
who are competent to impart it. The
imances of the several companies were
found to be tn excellent condition, the
companies having husbanded their funds
to enable them, in cape no special appro
priation is tnado for the purpose, to carry
cuUt tho orders lor target practice.
Vijor Margo. inspector of the Second
J>ngade, completed the work ot inspection
by. being with Company H of the Fifth
infantry, at Napa and* Livermore, ia?t

Little by little the rules and regulations
of the Guard are being amended at supe

SECOND BRIGADE
IS INSPECTED
Taken From the Transport on the Mc-
Dowell and Landed at Presidio
Wharf.
The transport Thomas' load of sick and
convalescent soldiers was landed yester
day at the Presidio wharf and taken from
there to the general hospital. Fewer am
bulances were needed for these soldiers,
as most of them were able to walk.
On reaching the hospital the men were
formed in squads and examined prepara
tory to being resigned to the wards or
convalescent camp.
Out of the total number received 106
were found fit for discharge and these
were sent to the post, where In a few days
they will receive their finals and be dis
charged from the service. The others were
found in need of further treatment and
given quarters In the various wards of the
immense hospital.
There were only eighteen litter cases on
the Thomas, and they will probably re
cover.
The nine Insane were sent to the insane
ward, whence as soon as practicable they
will be removed to the Washington hos
pital.
Sergeant Walter H. Sanden, Eleventh
Cavalry, and Patrick Tafe. private. Xinth
Infantry, died yesterday at the hospital.
During the month of November there
were twenty-seven deaths at the hospltaL

The cortege wended its way along Mar

evidence of respect for the memory of the
gallant soldier ar.d of sympathy for the
bereaved wife was shown.

SACRAMENTO, Dec. 2.â When the con
gregation of St. Paul's Church went to
that place of worship to-day It found on
the closed doors signs giving warning of
danger. At a meeting of the vestry yes
terday, the announcement was made that
this church, which for many years has
been one of the most prominent In North
ern California, must at once be razed to
Its very foundation. Some years ago the
Immense steeple ' on the church was re
moved In order to relieve the building
from strain. Since that time, it appears
the foundation has gradually weakened'
and the storm of November 20 greatly
racked the structure. A.' Robertson fore
man of the engineering department of the
Southern Pacific Company and one of the
most competent builders In the State
made a thorough examination of the
church and returned a report condemning
it in unequivocal terms. B
Rev. C.L. Miel only recently obtained
the - entire freedom of the church Â¦ from
debt. He Is greatly distressed over the
fate of the stately old edifice, but declares
that his congregation will put up a new
church which will be finer than the old
St. Paul's Church is - beautifully fur
nished and contains several magnificent
stained glass windows, one of them being
a ' memorial to : Creed Haymond and an
other to Leland Stanford Jr., the latter
having been presented some years ago by
Mrs. Jane L. Stanford.

minded enough not to take him to task
for his unKingly escapades. The second
act opens probably at mid-forenoon of the
day following the flight of Polixenes and
Camillo, who seem to have taken ship
on the night after the events of the last
scene. Mamillius is shown as preferring
his mother to the usual pastimes of a
King s nursery, and wearying her, not
by requisitions of amusement, but by
fondness dnd devotion. The smutched
nose no longer witnesses against bis
mother's dignity and carefulness for her
child; that was but for the moment,
while we were to look at Hermione with
her husband's eyes.
It is an idyllic moment; but the tale of
sprites and goblins is never told. Even
now is heard outside. In the passage, tha
tread of hastening feet Â«-nd without re
quest or permission Leontes and his lor<2Â»
stride in. He shows no disposition to ad
dress his Queen and probably does not
look her in the face. The consciousness
that her calm eyes are fixed on him. and
without expectation of evil, is not reassur
ing. Though he Is in detp excitement he
talks at length about his wrongs, appar
ently expecting that Hermlone will inter
rupt or ask some question. But she is
silent until he is prompted to seize Ma.
milllus. when she asks if it is sport. Le
ontes has the lad haled out, but finds
himself far from ready yet to voice hi*
accusation. So he speaks to the lords.

"Look on 'her: mark her well. But be about
To say 'she ia a goodly lady," and
The justice of your hearts will thereto add

When he is through there is bat &
strangely firm and klndlv answer:
"Should a villain aay so.
The moat replenished villain In the world.
He were aa much more villain. You, my lord.
Do but mistake."
There Is no hurt, no rebuke, no hint of
personalities in this reply; only lofty sor

beforehand all words of protest from, hii
lords. Hermione is not dismayed or
startled even yet. She excuses herself to
the lords for not giving way to heart
breaking tears, and declares her submis
sion to her husband's will. It 13 a sub
lime moment. The infinite unseen powers
seem to surround her and sustain her and
echo abroad her words. Nobody remem
bers the King's orders and Leontes cries
out, as in helplessness, for his rights. Af
ter a moment's silence, when all stand
yet as under a spell. Hermione asks that
her women, those who relieved her of
Mamillius at the opening, may be with,
her where she is going. There is no wori
of assent, there is no sound at all sav?
the sound of weeping, and there are few
dry eyes. Then Hermione. after a few
words to her husband â
"Adlau. my lord.
I never wished to see you sorry. Now
I trust I shallâ"
steps forth to prison. The women do not
follow until the Queen calls back for them.
As soon as, of her own motion, she is
fairly forth. Leontes finds his tongue, and
bids the halberd men do his bidding. But
they only escort the Queen, unarrested,
upon the way that she was going.
In the character of Hermione. which Is
wholly womanly, there Is fortitude unus
ual for her sex; acd from the scene be
tween her husband and Polixenes, in the
first act, some Impression of boldness has
perhaps been left upon our minds. To
remove any most distant suggestion of
mannishness, the author furnishes to the
plot Paulina â a creation unknown to
Greene's novel â in the second scene. The
moment we see her and recognize the typ*
all disproportion or lack of harmony In
the character of Hermione disappears.
The effect Is analogous to what is seen
sometimes of the tempering of hues In a
lady's toilet. The shade of the material
proposed for a gown proves too pro
nounced on making up; but a bit of coxn
plemental color somewhere, as at the
shoulder or In the sash, saves the whole
to harmony. The first need of a Paulina
here is to womanize and soften Hermi
one's strength of will.
We pass now to the trial scene In the
third act. Greene speaks of a Jury, but
this process has no such English feature.
Hermlone has no advocate to speak for
her or offer counsel. Her Indictments be
ing read, there Is no Inquiry whether she
proposes to attempt defense. But there
is little need. She rises, and begins at
once to address the court. She has little
hope that the proceedings now opened will
result In justice; yet she feels the sublim
est certitude that no aimed or attempted
Injustice will do her any harm:
"But thus: If power* divine
Behold our human actionsâ aa they doâ
I doubt not then but Innocence shall mak*
False accusations blush and tyranny
Tretnh)* at patience."
Her utter, absolute faith In the right
transfigures her and makes the court,
with all its pomp and ceremony, seem a
cheap and sorry thing. Leontes had
thought perhaps to overawe Hermlone by
the display and pomp of this great con
clave, by the array of lords and Judsres
and doctors learned In the law; but she
has that within her which Is greater and
mightier than they all. It fa withal a
woman's pleading; there la no masculine
diction or emphasis or logic anywhere.
But it Is not a woman pleading for her
self.
Noteâ The studv of "The Winters TalV

It Is clear that Polixenes. in spite of
the savage hints he has received, is not
greatly displeased at the chance of stay

Heroines of "The Winter's Tale."
It Is not often that a novel or a drama
has two heroines, and this happens no
where in Shakespeare except In "The Win
ter's Tale." But "The Winter's Tale" la
unique among the plays of Shakespeare
for other reasons, all of them more Im
portant and remarkable than this. It is,
In the first place, neither comedy nor
tragedy, but a union of both. From the
opening: till nearly the end of scene III in
the third act It is tragedy; after that it
is the essence of comedy. Again, the play
stands by itself for its defiance of the
usual time restrictions, since the period
covered by it is sixteen years and over.
More than all, the plot requires that these
sixteen years, necessary in order that a
Princess, born after the piece opens, may
have a lover before its close, shall consti
tute a period of penance for the King ami
that the Queen, pretending to be dead,
shall continue Inexorable and keep him In
suffering for all that time. This has
seemed, among students and readers gen
erally, a blemish, and been accounted
wholly improbable.
Shakespeare, apparently aimed and ex
pected to make these things seem reason
able, and even yield results of power; but
to show this would require longer and
closer study than can be contemplated
here. The chief Interest in "The Winter's
Tale" centers in its two heroines, Her
mione and her daughter Perdita. Her
mlone is the strongest and- grandest char
acter among Shakespeare's women, and is
probably the most remarkable feminine
creation in all literature. That this has
not been generally recognized is due rather
to the author's manner of treatment than
to asperities or defects in the character
itself. For the opening of "The Winter's
Tale" Is dismal and ehows little promise
of the greatness to be enacted in it. It is,
like "Cymbeline," a play of Jealousy, but
there is no such evolution or explanation
of the reasons as we find in the rival
work. In "Cymbeline" we are fascinated
by the beauty and nobleness of Imogen's
nature at the outset, and covet for her,
before her trouble come*, the largest hap
piness. We see, too, the brewing of the
mischief that alienates her husband from
her. In "The Winter's Tale" the author
keeps us from discerning the essential
worth of his heroine till the end of the
first act. He begins by presenting to us
King Leontes. her husband, in a fit of
jealousy for which no adequate cause ap
pears and which has seemed to many
readers inartistic. i .
Some hint of Hermione's greatness,
however, shines out even at her first
speaking in the second scene of the play.
Polixenes, In a rather grandiloquent way.
has intimated that, since he has come
to the end of a nine months' visit, he in
about ready to go home. He is very
grateful for his entertainment, and feels
that, were he to thank his Klngrfriend
properly, he should need to stay another
three-quarters of a year. Leontes, of
course, is bound to reply in kind, depre
cating the acknowledgment and urging
a yet longer tarrying. But he will, do
nothing of the kind, and even insinuates
stiffly that Polixenes, for all his saying,
does not mean to go. That makes Polixe
nes drop his circumlocutions and declare
that he shall go to-morrow. "Besides,""
he says, "I have stayed to tire your roy
alty." Instead of the expected protest
ings, Leontes Implies that his guest has
said truth:
"We are tougher, brother.
Than you can put us to "t."
That is to say: "You don't know how
much I can stand."
This is a disgraceful situation, and
fortunate it is that there are no more
courtiers present. All this while Her
mlone has been standing In silence be
side her husband, awaiting the outcome
of the dialogue. Leontes quickly ex
hausts his immediate resources, yet can
not leave the dialogue where It has been
brought; so he calls upon the Queen to
save the good name of his court. Even
his ungracious manner as well aa the
ungracious thing he says shows why she
has not aided him before and why he
has not addressed her hitherto. Plainly
enough Leontes is jealous, and believes
that his friend is staying, not for the
sake of his society, but his wife's. Of this
Jealousy Hermlone is certainly aware,
for she deftly avoids asking her hus
band's guest to remain, while making It
virtually Impossible for him to insist on
going. She "adventures the borrow of a
week" â the minimum time proposed by
her husband, chatters brilliantly over
Polixenes' solemn refusal, and half
charms away her husband's ugly mood:
You'll stay?
No, madam.

POLICE SEIZE
FOOD AT DAWSON
Four Prominent Merohanta
Are Placed Under
Arrest.
Plead Ignorance of the Condition of
the Articles Offered for Sale
and Are Dis
missed.
Special Dispatch to The CatL
TACOMA. Dec. 2.â Four Dawson mer
chants were arrested two weeks ago
charged with selling impure foods. The
arrests were made without warning and
caused great astonishment.' The police
followed up this action by seizin? and de
stroying seventy-five. tons of butter, bacon
and hams and several tons of other eat
ables. Investigation showed that nearly
all of the goods seized were sold two
months ago for dog food by the Alaska
Commercial Company. Speculators then
obtained possession of the condemned
goods and they were soon placed in the
regular channels of trade. The merchants
offering them for sale were very severely
arraigned in the Dawson Police Court.
They pleaded ignorance of the fact that
the condemned food was in such bad con
dition, and were finally dismissed without
being fined. They were notified, however,
that severe penalties would be inflicted In
the event of a reoccurrence of the of
fense.
The Dawson police authorities arÂ« now
more strict than ever before as regards
the quality of food sold in the Klondike
metropolis. Police inspectors frequently
visit the stores, and any -complaint made
is swiftly followed up. This plan was
adopted last winter, when 800 tons of
spoiled beef were seized and confiscated at
one time.
Excellent mining reports have come
from Alaska. The richest quartz ledge
ever found In the Atlln district has been
uncovered In the Gleaner group, on Taku
arm. David von Cramer has reached
Skaguay with samples of the ore, !n which
free gold la plentiful. He says the ledge
â¢is eighteen feet wide and that It contains
a streakÂ«of wonderfully rich ore. Two and
a half ounces from this streak pounded In
a mortar yielded $1 60 in gold. The own
ers declare that a half-ton of picked ore
will yield over $12,000.
A. G. Preston of White Horse brings
news that the number of men at work In
the copper mines there has been doubled
since the completion of the White Pass
Railroad to White Horse. The ore of the
district Is veryrich and there seems to be
no end to It. The .belt bo far discovered Is
about fourteen miles long by two miles
wide, and equally rich ore Is found in all
parts of the belt. The assays run as high
as 72 per cent copper, $20 in gold and 14 to
15 ounces In silver. Several mines. In
cluding the Copper Klngr and "War Eagle,
will ship ore this winter, sending It by
sleighs to the railroad.
A letter from Cook Inlet -states that the
richest placers known in the district were
found last month. Jack Button took from
his Canyon Creek claim gravel giving $40
per pan. The men working a lay on Lknox
Creek cut through a bar averaging $20 per
day per man. In two weeks they took out
about $1500 worth of gold. Two weeks ago
mining operations In the district were
suspended for the winter. A rich strike
has been made on the Monte -Carlo. Index
district. Washington. At a- depth of 320
feet the tunnel encountered a vein of gray
copper yielding values of nearly $100 per
ton in gold and silver.
Gompers Goes to Louisville.
"WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.-Pres!dent Sam
uel Gompers of the American Federation
of Labor left to-night for Louisville. Ky..
to attend the twentieth annual convention
of the federation, which, he says, will be
the largest and most representative meet-
Ing ever held by that body. Accompany
ing him were Messrs. Peter Curran and
John "Weir, fraternal delegates from the
British Trades Union Congrress.

Charles Franks was arrested about 4
o'clock yesterday morning by Sergeant
O'Connor and Policeman Beach at a cigar
stand at 5*4 Grant avenue and booked at
the City Prison on a charge of burglary.
The officers watched him and saw him try
to break off an iron bar In front of the
stand. Not succeeding, he climbed over
the iron rail and got inside.
Franks was identified in the City Prison
as Charles Feder. a former clerk In the
White House, who was caught stealing
articles from his employers, and It was
taid he had been doing so for two years.
For the sake of his family the proprietors
did not have him arrested. He refused to

liquor, foolishly entered the cigar stand
to gut a vallee for a friend who had left it
there.

GALLANT RESCUE
PROVES USELESS
Two of a gang of bay pirates, for whom
the police have been looking for some
time, were captured yesterday afternoon
after a long chase by Policeman Thomas
Naylor. One of the gang, supposed to be
the leader, escaped, although almost with
in the clutches of the law.
Frequent complaints have been made
to the police about a party of young men,
wno have been raiding small vessels on
*he Mission flats. Whenever a yacht or
k>oat would be left without a watchman
ihey would sail up at night, strip it of
everything portable and salable. Captain
bplllane determined to capture the ma
rauders if possible and specially detailed
Naylor for this dutj*.
Naylor found the gang yesterday after
noon at Hathaway'g wharf.* They eluded
him for a time, but Naylor finally located
them again in a boat anchored under a
wharf at the foot of Merrlmac and Ken
tucky streets, near the Arctic Oil Works.
Naylor jumped from the wharf into the
mud and caught John Kelly and James,
alias "Pogie," Lambert. The third man.
Cockey Stevens, jumped from the boat
Into a skift and rowed away. The pris
oners- were sent to the Hall of Justice,
where they were charged with vagrancy.
An examination of the boat showed that
it was admirably adapted fox the purposes
of -ts 'hobo" owners. The list of articles
on board, which were confiscated by the
police and sent to the -property clerk's
office, would make an excellent inventory
of a second-hand store. .
A keen-bladed knife about six inches

which would be'taken from one vessel and
transferred to their own. As soon as this
would be done, the "pirates" would make
sail up the bay, and, stay away lone
enough to avoid suspicion. As soon as
arf owner can be found for the prooe-tv
taken yesterday by the police more se
rious charges will be preferred against
Policeman Naylor Captures

TWO BUY PIRATES
CLEVERLY CAUGHT
Hermann Bishop, who shot John Murphy
In tho neck at 14 McAllister street early
yesterday morning, was booked at the
City Prison yesterday on a charge of as
sault to murder. Mamie Bigelow, the
woman who was with Bishop at the time,
is being detained at the prison as a wit
ness.
There is a bit of romance in connection
with the shooting. About five years ago
a lodging-house at Fifth and Stevenson
streets, while being raised for the purpose
of building a bnck foundation, collapsed.
Mamie was a roomer in the house and was
in her room at the time of the accident.
She was rescued from the debris by Mur
phy, who was then a member of Engine
Company 17. An attachment sprang up
between them and they lived together till
about a year ago, when Murphy went to
Cape Nome. During his absence she met
Bishop, whom she had knpwn previously.
Murphy returned recently from ! Cape
Nome and Saturday nlgnt lie met the
young woman and went with her as
far as 14 McAllister street, where she
left him, going to Bishop's room. Murphy
followed her and tried to force open the
door. Bishop warned him to go away, but
he broke the glass In the door and said
to Bishop, "I've got a bead on you."
Thinking he had a revolver. Bishop fired
and the bullet struck Murphy in the neck.
Bishop opened the door and Murphy said,
"You're the best man; shake." He was
persuaded to go to the Receiving Hospi
tal, where his wound was dressed. He
says he will not prosecute Bishop.
Later Bishop and the woman were ar
rested by Detectives Ed Gibson and
Bailey. The prisoner handed over the re
volver and paid he had fired the shot in
self-defense. â¢ * *
John Murphy Bravely Saves
a Woman From a Cruel

ROMANCE IN LIFE
OF A FIREMAN
strains of "Ave Maria" burst from the
organ during the offertory and Mme.
Melba took her position by Eugene
Boegner, first violinist of the Grand Opera
orchestra, who played the violin obllgato.
All was silence throughout the church
during the rendition, the stillness being
broken only by the clink of the offerings
of the congregation. No Durst of applause
such as Mme. Melba has heard so often
greeted her, but the solemn Bcene of the
kneeling worshipers and the magnificence
of her lines inspired her. "Ave Maria"
was sung with all the feeling of Melba's
wondrous voice, FOftened with religious
ecstacy. The end of the song was a re
gret. The singer's voice grew softer and
lighter till it mingled with the whispers
of those saying the rosary, then ceased.
'Sanctus," by the choir, rang through
the church and Melba retired. The con-
gregation knelt at communion and when
thÂ«r prayers were done Cremonini took
his place beside the organist. "Salve
Maria" is not calculated to move the
souls of men, as Is "Ave Maria." Its
theme is complex, like the recitative of
an oratorio, but Cremonlni's rich tenor
voice brought out all its perfections.
Father Smith pronounced the benedic
tion and out through the waiting throng
Melba and Cremonini made their way to
their carriage.
Lord. Inside all was silence, save for the
mellow notes of the organ and the violin
and the clear, sweetly plaintive intona
tions of the diva's voice. Outside a mighty
crowd surged around the entrance and
grew impatient after a futile battle for
admission to the sacred edifice. Later,
Â¦when tantalizing fragments of Merca
dante's "Salve Maria" floated from the
throat of Cremonini out over the crowd
in the street, it surged forward toward
the doors again, begging, imploring and
praying for admission, but a corps of po
licemen kept back the stormers.
The announcement that Mme. Melba
would sing Gounod's "Ave Maria" at the
Paulist Church, and would be followed
by Slgnor Cremoninl. also of Grau'? com
pany, in the rendition of Mercadante's
"Salve Maria," assured a vast congrega
tion. The police were therefore called
upon to keep It from overcrowding the
church and thus prevent possible acci
dent. A further precaution was taken bv
the Paulist fathers to keep- outsiders
from- usurping the> seats of the regular
pew holders. Tickets to the parishioners
were issued and outsiders were thus de
prl\-ed of admission. It was still early In
the morning, however, when the people
from other parishes began to gather near
the church door. Melba was to sing at 11
o'clock, but they were unaware that dis
appointment awaited them. An hour or
so before the service opened the ticket
holders began to arrive. This necessitated
the opening of the church and the crowd
rushed for the doors. The police drove
them back and announced that none but
ticket holders would be admitted. The
crowd, however, refused to accept defeat
B*e*use she feared for her life. Mir.
Eusle Conwar shot Edward Conway. a
'.eilni's cutter, last night at their resi
dence, tl7 Nineteenth street, Oakland.
The bullet from the pistol lodged in Con
wy's right side. Inflicting a dangerous
wound, but one which the surgeons say
will not necessarily prove fatal. The
vwnaa, who claims to be Conway's wife.
mts he attacked her with a knife. After
shooting twice through the^eeiling sbe
fired the third shot with the pistol aimed
Â¦traigrht ax Conway as he was upon her
with u-pUfted kxlfe.
The trouble, according to the woman,
was the result of drunken abuse and
threats Conwiy made to kill her. Milton
Kitch, 14 years old, a. eon of Mrs. Conway,
â¢wilM present during the affray and in a
BtttecKKit to the police corroborated his
mother's story. Conway denied hÂ© had
m. knife and said the shooting- was due to
hie declaration that ho had Intended to
part company with the pistol wlelder.
He said she was not his wife,
Other circumstances surrounding the
difficulty tend further to bear out the
woman's version of the shooting. Short
ly after 7 o'clock E. S. Cheney, a pho
tographer, who boarded with the Con
ways, telephoned to Night Police Captain
Pftersen at the City Hall that a police
man vu wanted to arrest Conway, who
was at home, ' drunk and abusive. ThÂ«
patrol wagon was sent, but before it ar
rived the shooting had occurred. Fif
teen minutes later Captain Petersen re
ceived another message, this time from
I>r. Cunningham at 1471 Grove street, call
ing for the police to take a Â¦wounded man
to the hospital. The man was Conway,
vÂ»hn had run out of his house to the doc
tor's, a block away, after he was shot.
â¢ The shooting occurred In the kitchen.
Mrs. Conway' s Ftory follows:
Conway came home drunk and ugly. My son
and 1 were In the kitchen when he came out
and demanded his pittol. I wouldn't let him
r*t it but took thÂ«- weapon myself. Then he
l-lckfd up a knife and started toward me,
Fhoutlnp. "If you don't give me that gun I'll
cut your throat."
I drew the pistol tip and warned him. "Don't
you. come near me or I'll shoot you." He
didn't stop and then 1 fired a shot through the
railing. As he advanced, brandishing the
knife. I again *ar:.iÂ»l him and nred again in
th*' Â«ir. He did not pausa, but w&s then
right clos* to me. Fearing that in his drunken
fury he would make good his threats, 1 aimed
th* pistol straight at him and fired. That
â¢FtoiT**! him. He rushed out of the house and
I went into another room to wait for the po
li<-*>.
When Conway Is sober he If good enough for
anybody, but he has been drunk for a week
'and vrry ujtly and threatening ell of the time.
. He is a lunatic when he is in liquor. Once
fri^fore he had trouble with a. woman, who Rhot
him. I know that if he lives he will come
. to h5iÂ« Â»ensos= and t+ sorry for this.

With plowing 1 oratorical eloquence, sol
emn requiem music and Impressive ser
vice for the dead, San Francisco Lodge
No. 3, Benevolent and Protective Order of
Elks, yesterday afternoon at the Grand
Opera-house paid tribute to the memory
of their departed brothers.
The rule of the order Is that each lodge
in the United States shall on the first Sun
day In December hold memorial services.
A number, of these services have been held
in this city, but yesterday's observance of
the event far eclipsed all previous ones.
The service commenced at 2 o'clock, but
long before the appointed hour the opera
house was thronged with. Elks and their
friends, who were admitted by cards of in
vitation. The foyer of the theater was beau
tifully decorated for the occasion Jwith
white chrysanthemums, palms , and rare
hothouse plants. The stage boxes were
also tastefully decorated with evergreens
and elks' heads. The stage when the cur
tain went up presented a beautiful though
solemn picture. An enormous elk stood
silently In the background In a command-
Ing position. A circle of light fell on an
ivy cross hung with a mourning emblem.
At their stations were the officers of the
lodge, a circle \of members around them.
There was an overture by the orchestra,
members of the lodge marching In while
i the selection was being rendered and oc
j cupying seats in the center of the house.
Exalted Ruler T. F. Bonnet then formally
I opened the memorial service with the reg
ular ritual appointed by the order. The
| Elks' quartet sang "Still, Still With
"I nee. The opening ode followed, sung by
all the Elks standing. The Rev. John
Hemphill, D. D. t offered a fervent invoca
tion, and Mrs. A. B. Marquart executed
with fine technique a harp eolo, "Chant
Seraphlque."
D. M. Delmas, who had been invited by
the committee to deliver the oration, had
been particularly requested to take as his
subject "The Immortality of the Soul." He
said In part:
Wherever human lips have moved In prayer,
whether In the Bolltude of the hermit's cell
or in the multitudinous concourse which in
tones the swelling anthem under the groined
arches of stately cathedrals â whether to voice
the language of the affluent ritual of civilized
man or to chant the rude Incantation of the
savage; and wherever human hands have erect
ed an altar, whether of simple boughs beneath
the canopy of heaven or of marble and gold
and precious stonea under the lofty dome of
some majestic minster; and wherever human
eyes, 'dimmed with tears of anguish, have
turned their orbs In mute but passionate ap
peal to a hidden power for assuagement in
sorrow or courage in despairâ there proofs have
teen given of man's longing for Immortality.
These are the outward evidences of the reli
gious feeling Inherent in inÂ« human heart and
inseparable from human existence; and with
out the hope of Immortality were religion a de
lusion, worship a mockery and prayer as vain
and empty as sounding brass and tinkling cym
bal.
Nor may reason discard this hope aÂ» a mere
fitful and transitory gleam of our emotional
nature. Strive as he may to weed from out
his breast all sentiment or emotion, resolve he
never bo firmly to accept as truth nothing save
what the cold precepts of logic demonstrate,
sear his heart as he will with the drear study
of skeptical metaphysicians, still shall not man
quench the fire of this inextinguishable flame.
Bulwark them as he may, the time will come
when the barriers of his factitious stoicism will
break asunder and pent up humanity will re
sume her sway.
At the close of tHe oration Slgnor
Abramoff sang: Adolphe Adams' "Cantique
de Noel." Brother Lewis Morrison then
read several poems selected appropriate to
the occasion. The quartet sang "Good-
Night." Brother J. J. Barrett then deliv
erad the eulogy. He said:
We gather to-day In spirit at the new-made
graves of our dead. We leave the scones and
thoughts and pastimes of pleasure, and "in
mute procession on the houseless road" we
bear our dear ones to their place of rest. Be
neath the kindly sheltering trees that line the
winding pathway on the silent slope we lay our
Bleeping brothers down. We turn their faces
to the light for a last, full view of every fea
ture, and as trait after trait comes back to us
and memory throbs over the past -we whisper
thÂ« manly story that is closed. We pay our
final public tribute. And before we leave them
In the unnumbered company of the dead, as we
yield them to the cold embraue of mother earth,
we fix upon our comrades' breasts our little
flowers of love.
We have gathered on the shore of the ocean
of death and we watch their barque as It sails
away. As it dips at last below the horizon's
edge wo see them on the masthead 'waving us
fondly their final adieu. We signal back across
the waters our message of sorrow and hope.
Departed brothers, heaven speed you to the port
of rest. May angels guide you on the trackless
deep. May the winds be gentle and the waters
still. May the course be straight and the voy
age swift. May the day be fair and full of
light. May the heavens swing their brightest
lanterns through the night. May brother Elks
be waiting at the water's edge to meet you.
And when the waves that break about our feet
shall catch us also up and bear us oft from
those we love may we Join you again In the
land of the blessed in sweet companionship
that shall never end.
At the close of his address the orchestra
played Handel's "Largo." The entire
audience then arose and received the ben
ediction of the Rev. Dr. Hemphill.
The following members of the lodge
composed the memorial committee: Dr. E.
N. Short, chairman: A. J. Carmany, sec
retary; J. N. Odell. R. P. Churchill. T. J.
McCann, Phillip Bolger and I* C. Iuen.
