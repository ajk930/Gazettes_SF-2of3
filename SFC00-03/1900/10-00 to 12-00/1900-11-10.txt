"The frauds in the Third District were
too flagrant to stand an honest investiga
tion, and in many places in the Eighth
District Democratic challengers were
sworn In as deputy Sheriffs and wore
badges in the booths. In the Seventh Dis
trict over 400 Republican voters in the
city of Lexington were* deprived of votes
by the delay tactics practiced by the
Democratic officers, while the Franklin
County and Owen County returns were
padded so bodly that it cannot escape the
notice of any one acquainted with those
counties.
"There are also extensive reports of
frauds in Lawrence, Rowan, Nicholas and
Mason counties In the Ninth District, with
great efforts to Increase those frauds In
the final count. The Commissioners of
Lawrence County attempted to throw out
the vote of the precinct of Charley on a
trivial technicality. It gave the Republi
can candidate 127 majority. In a number
of counties the Commissioners refused to
allow any inspection of the work of elec
tion officers by representatives of the Re
publican party. Reports of fraud, of five
to ten votes to a precinct are so numerous
that the Inference cannot be escaped that
it was systematically planned beforehand.
"In many Democratic strongholds the
Democrats are said to have failed to com
ply with the provisions of bill No. 19. In
every such Instance this committee has
instructed the representatives of the~Re
publican party to make no technical ob
jections if they believed the votes to be
legally cast and counted. There ' is no
question that, if the face of the returns
fall to show Yerkes' election, we can
make specific exposures that will show
that he has been defeated, not by a ma
jority of the voters of Kentucky, but of
tne fraudulent use of the advantage given
the Democratic party by the Goebel elec

lowing statement concerning the Ken
tucky, election:
"We have discovered great frauds per
petrated by the Democrats in various sec
tions of the State. In Breathitt County
frauds amounting to over 400 votes in fa
vor of the Democrats have been discov
ered. In one precinct In that county the
Democrats refused to allow the Republi

precinct, which usually goes Republican
by a majority of 58, was carried by the
Democrats by 30. In another precinct in
the same county the Republican chal
lengers were put out of the booth by
force and the Inspectors were refused ad
mittance. In another precinct the returns
showed that only fifty-five Republicans
voted, yet there are 140 who gave their
names and are willing to make affidavit
that they voted the Republican ticket
straight. The Republicans usually carry
that precinct, and this year It went Demo
cratic by 150. Other frauds in Breathitt
County indicate that we lost over 400
votes.
"Numerous and flagrant frauds have

Gives Due "Warning.
His extraordinary speech closed with a
fervid appeal to the people of England
to maintain their defenses in such a per
fect condition that '"we shall not be ex
posed to any sudden interruption of the
peace upon which our prosperity de
pends."
"The supreme condition," exclaimed the
Premier. "Is that no reform, no improve
ment, is of the slightest vaiue uniess se
curity against external interrerence is ob
tained by putting our defenses in t>uch a
position that no accident may happen be
yond our borders that shall make our se
curity doubtful."
The majority of Lord Salisbury's hear
ers believed that this warning, which was
delivered in his most impressive manner,
referred to the possibility of French an
tagonism.
Mr. Choate's speech consisted chiefly of
a humorous sketch of the history ot
Downing street, which he said was named
after a Massachusetts boy. In conclusion
he expressed his belief that "so long aa
Lord Salisbury and McKinley continue to
hold the reins of government there wiii
be no danger of any disturbance of the
honorable and friendly relations now ex
isting between the United States ana
Great Britain."
Other Speeches Made.
George J. Goschen, the retiring First
Secretary of the Admiralty, who used tha

Lord Salisbury, winding up the proceed

Orange and Transvaal colonies will be

CHOATE PRAISED BY PRESS.
Relieved Seriousness "Which Threat-
ened to Become Too Marked.
LONDON, Nov. 10.â The Standard and
Dally Telegraph dilate editorially upon
the Importance of Mr. Choate's assur
ances regarding Anglo-Saxon amity at the
Guildhall banquet last night. The Daily
Telegraph thinks the American Embaa
sador's tone was quite significant and re
gards his glowing eulogy of Lord Salis
bury as perhaps the most remarkable
feature of the banquet.
The Times says: "A Guildhall audi
ence always looks to the American Em
bassador to contribute to the enjoyment
of the evening, and it very rarely looks In
vain.. Mr. Choate fully maintained tha
reputation established by his predecessor.
He managed to relieve a seriousness
which threatened to become too marked
for a convivial occasion by turning aside
into the paths of politics.
"Lord Salisbury ventured upon the par
donable irregularity of expressing the uni
versal feeling of this country regarding
the Presidential election. Had its issue
been different, we should not have aban
doned our faith in the ability of the Amer
ican people to avert many of the evil re
sults that might have been inferred 'from
Mr. Bryan's electoral speeches; but since.
things turned out so happily, there Is no
Indiscretion in expressing our satisfaction
at the striking triumph of political com
mon sense and commercial honor."
The Times, like the other morning pa
pers, is evidently not altogether pleased
with Lord Salisbury's lukewarmness on
the subject of army reforms.
LONDON. Nov. 9.â What is prob
ably the most brilliant of all
functions in Englandâ the Lord
Mayor's banquetâ took place
this evening. It will be memor
able even to Americans, by reason of the
following utterance of Lord Salisbury,
who. in the presence of 900 guests, includ
ing United States Embassador Choate.
the members of the British Cabinet and
many of the leading men of England,
spoke as follows of the American elec
tion:
"We believe that the cause which has
won is the cause of civilization and com
mercial honor. We believe those princi
ples to be at the root of all prosperity and
all progress in the world. Therefore we
claim that we have as much right to re
joice in what has taken place as the dis
tinguished gentleman (referring to Mr.
Choate) who sits at my Bide."
This was followed by loud and pro
longed cheers, which made the gold plate
on the oaken shelves* shiver and the great
rafters of the Guildhall ring and ring
again.
Lord Salisbury's incursion into the na
tional politics of the United States was
preceded by an apology, in the course of
which he said:
"Of the current circumstances which
gratified me most during the past year one
has been the hearty feeling displayed be
tween this country and the United States.
I hope Mr. Choate will forgive me if there
is any irregularity in my expression. It
Is quite wrong for a Secretary of State
to make any observations with respect to
the international politics of another coun
try, but I am soon to give up my office.
and in view of this abandonment which
is close at hand, I hope Mr. Choate will
forgive me for expressing the supreme
satisfaction with which all of us have
heard of what has recently taken place in
the United States."
Mr. .Choate Replies.
Mr. Choate, replying a few minutes
later to the toast of the diplomatic corps,
declared that Lord Salisbury had stated
with such truth, simplicity and earnest
ness the result of the election that he
(Choate) would not attempt to add to it,
although he would venture to congratu
late the noble Lord upon the fact that his
remarks had been made after instead of
before the election. (Laughter.)
Except in its references to the United
States, the speech of the Premier cast an
extraordinary gloom over the gorgeous
banquet.
Following directly after the colonel com
manding the City Imperial " Volunteers,
Lord Salisbury startled his hearers, who
caught the drift of his remarks, by satir
izing the war fever, although praising the
courage of the soldiers, and declaring that
the passionate admiration of military
valor evinced by the populace must pro
duce a change of attitude on the part of
the outside world when viewing English
character.
Causes Tears to Be Shed.
Then, with lowered voice and almost
trembling accent, he went on to speak
of the price of victory and the ravages
of death, dealing especially with the
Queen's bereavement In the loss of
Prince Christian Victor. Finally, with
bent head and hands clasped, he uttered
a hope, almost a prayer, that Lord Rob
erts might be spared the sorrow now
banging over him by reason of the criti
cal condition of his daughter. Tears
sprang to the eyes of women and men
moved uncomfortably in their seats. The
silence and solemnity grew oppressive.
Awakening from self-abstraction the
Premier reviewed the events of the last
twelve months. Mr. Kruger and the Em
press of China, he went on to say, had
forced war upon Great Britain. He main
tained that the British War Office de
served great credit for the way in which
it had handled these emergencies.
"Despite nebulous and factitious attacks
we should be glad to improve all the de
fects of the War Office," he continued,
"and our utmost efforts will be devoted
to that task, but I should rather depre
cate any unnecessary examination into
what has occurred. You will not add to
the enthusiasm of your troops by doing
Anglo-German Compact.
He dilated upon the strengthened ties
between the mother country and colonies
during the present year and poked fun at
the delay consequent upon the European
concert when dealing with China. It was
not appropriate for him, he declared, to
comment upon negotiations while in
progress, but he said he . would make an
exception in the Anglo-German compact.
"This," he remarked, "represents the
feelings of most If not all the powers
allied. It is impossible to lay too
much emphasis upon Â¦ the integrity of
China and the 'open door," and I think
it a matter of great advantage that the
powers should have expressed themselves
In favor of these federal principles., for
if they are achieved the issue of the China
problem need not concern us very anxi
ously."
He maintained ve^jr earnestly that the
Idea of Invading China with "our scanty
force" or of approaching the stupendous
task of governing China Instead of leav
ing it to be governed by the Chinese was
most dangerous.
Relapsing into pessimism, Lord Salis-
Lord Salisbury made a most remarkable speech at the Lord
Mayor's banquet last night. He said Britons claimed the right to
rejoice at the result of the American elections, and spoke so feel
ingly of the sickness of Lord Roberts' daughter that tears were
shed by many of the guests. Then the aged Premier reviewed re
cent war events, and approved in no uncertain way the policy of
maintaining ths "open door" in China.

this morning, which destroyed upward
of one hundred bu'.lc.ngs and rendered
hundreds of people homeless. Biloxi is a
town of 7000 people, and a well-knowÂ«

had nothing further to feed on. _
The fire started shortly after midnight
in a saloon near the Louisville and Nash

depot swept through to the beach, a dis
tance of several squares. No lives were
lost, but many of the poorer people lost
all their possessions. The Catholic
church, school and convent, two news

were among the buildings destroyed. The
total loss is estimated at $300,000, with
$125,000 insurance.

The Bank of British Columbia of thl3
city is about to retiie under its present
title and, to. take the name of the Cana
dian Barrk of Commerce, of which it is a
branch. Notice to that effect has been
sent out to those who have been doing
business with the Bank of British Co
lumbia. The explanation given by bank
ers is that the Canadian Bank of Com
merce, which Is a very large Institution,
with headquarters at Toronto. Canada,
has several branches and it has beea
thought better to have them all under one
name instead of having an unnecessary
diverslty in different localities when there
Is only really one Institution. The move
has been contemplated for some time, but
nothing has been said about it because
there will really be no change In the busi
ness. The present Bank of British Colum
bia will go out of existence under that
title, but the local branch of the Canadian
Bank of , Commerce- will be in 'Charge of
the officers now conducting the business
here.
Notices of the contemplated change
were sent out to depositors yesterday and
they were informed rf the true signifi
cance. They were asked to continue to do
business with the Institution under the
new name. J. H. Plumber of the Canadian
Bank of Commerce has been assisting
Walter Powell, manager of the BankT of
British Columbia, to make ready for the
new conditions. The Canadian Bank of

change soon to take place.

"The eyes of the entire world," he said,
"are upon this nation. We are but in the
experimental stage of the theory that a
government of the people can be governed
by Its people, and it is but a question or
time when the entire universe will follow
our successful demonstration of that the
ory. It Is almost beyond man to conceive
what a wonderful idea it is that men
of this country are the makers of their
own, laws and possessed of equal fran
chises. The charges of bribery and cor
ruption during our elections are infinitesi
mal compared to the truth and goodness
of our people. It is Impossible to point
to a circle of a hundred men and say
there Is not one who is not above suspi
cion."
"Our public school system Is the great

fact that our people can be. educated to
govern themselves. It is not alone secu

power of self-government, for without
morality we would not last long. .
"With our Immense moral force as a

It was paid yesterday that the mysterl
oue passenger was a Miss Morris before
her marriage and came of a wealthy Cali
fornia family.
After some hesitation and further ar
gument the man who had the paper got
into the cab with Mrs. Biddle and drove
away*, while the other man went back
and guarded the passenger's baggage. He
was said to be a Mr. Demarest from the
office of J. P. Morgan & Co. Mrs. Biddle
and the other man returned In about fif
teen minutes and after her baggage had
been passed drove awav in a cab, saying
Fhe was going to the Fifth-avenue Hotel.
At the hotel afterward it was said she
had not been there.
Two well dressed men now made an
entrance Into the comedy which was at
tracting bystanders.' The strangers speed
ily thickened the plot. They had been fol
lowing the woman at a distance and now
stepped up to the cab. After she had en
tered it they kept the door open and pre
vented it going on. One of them flour
ished a piÂ«Â»ce of paper in her face. It
looked like a bill or legal document.
After leaving the vessel she rushed for
the pier entrance, but was intercepted by
the Customs Inspector, to whom she ex
plained she must reach the telegraph of
fice. She was allowed to go into the tele
graph office, where, indeed, she did not
send a dispatch. When she left, she
immediately called a cab and prepared to
drive away.
The Germanic did not reach her pier
until nearly 9 o'clock. Mrs. Biddle, if that

NEW YORK, Nov. 9.â Among the pas
sengers who" arrived here on the White
Star liner yesterday was a young woman
who moved in an atmosphere of mystery
and excited a great deal of attention. She
was registered on the passenger list as
"Mrs. C. Drexel," but in her custom's dec
laration gave her name as Mrs. Constance
Drexel Biddle and her address as Phila
delphia. She is thought to be the wife of
Dr. Clement Biddle, who served as sur
geon of the battleship Texas and is allied
to the old Biddle family of Philadelphia,
whose social rank is high.
Mrs. Constance Biddle at one time sued
her husband for divorce and was to have
married George Work, who died in Swit

arrival of yesterday's mysterious passen

thing to do with a law eult.

Lord Rosebery indorses every word of this

Anti-Bryan Democrats of the South
have been in close communication with
members of the Republican party for the
last four years and they have discovered
that the lines of demarkatlon between
them are not insurmountable nor is the
association uncongenial. In Maryland,
West Virginia and Kentucky there are
several thousand influential business men
who were forced to oppose Bryanism four
years ago who may never return to ! the
Democratic party. In North Carolina,
South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Ten
nessee and Florida, it is declared, thexe
arts many successful business men who,
at heart, sympathize with Republican
ideas. and principles and would cheerfully
affiliate with that party if the race ques
tion could be made less prominent.
It is suggested that President McKinley
has successfully wiped out all traces of
sectionalism by his impartial distribution
of military appointments during the Span
ish war. On the same line it is argued
that he mights effectively solve the race
problem in the South by the exercise of
a little more human nature in the dis
tribution of Federal patronage. It is ex
asperating beyond endurance. Southern
ers say, to have colored men Apnointed

nal revenue and postmasters in progress

the bulk of the commercial business is
carried on by white men. It is impossible,
troy add. to expect Southern men to
calmly submit to nearro domination, and
some Republican leaders have about con
cluded that It may be wise to undertake
the organization of a white Republican
party In the South on practical business
princinles. It is possible that some repro
fentative Southern man will he appointed
to a Cabinet portfolio and prominent
white men may be appointed to Federal

Stuart's Catarrh Tablets Is a wholesome
combination of Blood Root, Guaiacol, En-
caluptol and similar antiseptics and they
cure catarrh and catarrhal deafness by
action upon the blood and mucous mem-
brane of the nose and throat.
A prominent specialist on ear trotrtftes
gives as his opinion that nine out of ten
cases cf deafness are traced to throat
trouble; this is probably overstated, but
It Is certainly true that more than half of
all cases of poor hearing were caused by
catarrh.
The catarrhal secretion in the nose and
throat finds its way into the eustachian
tube and by clogging |t up very soon af-
fects the hearing and the hardening of the I
secretion makes the loss of hearing per- 1^
manent, unless the catarrh which caused/
the trouble is cured.
Those who are hard of hearing may*
think this a little far fetched, but any onaT*
at all observant must have noticed how:'
a hard cold in the head will' affect the'.
hearing and that catarrh if long neglected i
will certainly Impair the sense ot hearing
and ultimately causa deafness.
It the nose and throat are kept clear
and free from the unhealthy secretions
of catarrh, the hearing will at once great-
ly improve and any one suffering from
deafness and catarrh can satisfy them-
selves on this point by using a 60-cent
box of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, a new
catarrh cure, which in the past year has
won the approval of thousands of catarrh
sufferers, as .well as physicians, because
It Is In convenient form to use, contains
no cocaine or opiate and Is as safe and
pleasant for children as for their elders.
ADVERTISEMENTS.
WHAT CAUSES DEAFNESS.
The Principal Cause Is Curable but
Generally Overlooked.
Many things may cause deafness, and
very often it is difficult to trace a caose.
Some people Inherit deafness. Actrte dis-
eases like scarlet fever sometimes causa
deafness. . But by far tha most common
cause of loss of hearing is catarrh ot the
head and throat.

to be no change whatever in the policy of
the United States with respect to China.
This is the conclusion reached by the
Cabinet at its meeting to-day after care
ful consideration of all the facts in con
oection with the present situation.
â¢â¢You can say authoritatively." a Cab
inet officer especially close to the Presi

dent will pursue the same route he has
followed from the outset and which has
as its object the early restoration of
peace, the maintenance of the Integrity of
China, and In establishment by treaty of
the open door. It was asserted by the
European press and by a certain class of
newspapers in the United States that in
case of the re-election of Mr. McKInley a
radical charge would be made in the pol
icy of this Government. The Call can
say without reserve that there is no
foundation for such reports. ThÂ«> Chinese
question in all its phase? was discussed
to-<iay by the Cabinet, and it was deter
mined to follow the same policy hitherto
observed. The United States will join no
power or i?roup of powers, but will act
concurrently with all if It deems it de

pledged, though It will preserve Its time

OFFICIALS DOUBT
RUSSIAN SEIZURE
Finances of the Empire
Are in Excellent
Condition.
"WASHINGTON, Nov. 9.â M. Routk'ow
sky. financial secretary of the Russia Em
bassy, has returned from St. Petersburg,
where he had an opportunity to confer
with the Russian Minister of Finance,
Dewitte, and to learn "from the imperial
authorities the exceptionally satisfactory
condition of Russian finances. Upon his
return Mr. Routkowsky was somewhat
surprised to see it reported that Russia
was seeking to place loans in the United
States. The rumors continue to circulate,
however, so Mr. Routkowsky gives the
Associated Press the following official
communication which he recently re
ceived from the Imperial Minister of Fi
nances of Russia:
"In view of the rumors which begin to
curculate again in the foreign press about
the suggested negotiations by the Imper
ial Russian Government of a loan the
Ministry of Finance considers it necessary
to declare once more that the Imperial
Russian Government is neither contem
plating nor disposed to negotiate loans of
any kind, the ordinary revenues and the
free cash reserve of the treasury being
more than sufficient to meet all expendi
tures not only ordinary, but also the ex
traordinary necessitated by the events in
the Far East."
Mr. Routkowsky was asked as to the
report from New York that Russia would
place orders amounting to $20,000,000 for
four new battlsships. to be built in Amer
ican shipyards and he replied:
"The Russian Government does not con
template any further additions to her
armament."

Mr. Bergerot has Issued the following
statement along with the announcement
of the appointments:
This committee has been selected by me with
a great deal of care and with a special view
to control the conduct of our next primary
election and of our next municipal campaign
In such a manner as to prevent the recurrence
of such disgraceful incidents as have In the
past characterized the primary elections held
by both of the leading 1 parties.
I do not txlieve that any of the Kentlenu>n
named by me can be subjected to any adverse
criticism by any citizen whose Judgment Is In
capable of beinar swerved by motives of petty
malice or spite. While I cannot answer for
the future actions or attitude of each one of
them. I can still vouch that more than two
thirds of them can be absolutely relied upon,
at all times, to do -what Is right and upright.
Their Â¦well-known character for honesty and
integrity is the best warrant of my sincere be
lief.
agrees with them that too much time Is
being wasted. He is accordingly bringing
pressure to bear upon European Govern
ments in the hope of causing them to give
instructions to their representatives which
will result in an agreement as to the basis
of the negotiations. China is doing her
share in this direction. Minister Wu hav
ing informed the secretary that the
Board of Punishments directed to con
sider the cases of Prince Tuan and other
princes and officials named in the recent
edict has made Its report. Tuan is sen
tenced to lose J:is rank, emoluments and
pay. and his estates are forfeited. His
degradation Is visited upon his children,
though an exception may be made In the
case of his son, selected as heir apparent.
Minister Wu savs this punishment is
considered by Chinese officials as only
short of death. Tuan is not banished,
there being no precedent for the exile of a
prince, but this will likely be demanded
by the Ministers. It is believed that other
princes named in the edict have met with
similar punishment and that officials of
lesser rank mentioned have also been
severely punished.
Minister Wu said to-night that there
could be no doubt of China's purpose to
pay the Indemnity the powers would de
mand. No confirmation of the reported
acquisition by Russia of a concession at
Tientsin has reached the State Depart
ment cr the Russian Embassy. Secretary
Hay attaches no importance to the mat
ter, as it Is stated all nations with the
exception of the United States and Russia
have concessions at Tientsin, and this
Government, during Cleveland's adminis
tration, relinquished its claim to a strip
of land there.
Count Casslnl. the Russian Embas?ador,
also regards the matter of little import
ance, and is inclined to regard the re
port with suspicion, as it is of Sharighai
date. Should it prove true, it could very
well be used by Great Britain and Ger
many as a pretext for action under article
3 of the Anglo-German agreement, but
the authorities doubt v*>ry much if they
will adopt a course which will certainly
meet active opposition in this country.

mans attacking the Chinese near Paoting-

SWEARS THAT ALVORD
CHANGED THE FIGURES
Strong Testimony Given by J. G. Gar
rison in the Hearing of the Ac
cused Note Teller.
NEW YORK, Nov. 9.â The further ex
amination in the case of C. L. Alvord Jr.,
the former note teller of the First Nation
al Bank, who Is accused of embezzling
$699,000 of the bank's funds, was contin
ued to-day before United States Commis
sioner Shields.
M. G. Hanna of Brooklyn, an assistant
bank examiner, was put through a long
examination and cross-examination. He
examined various clearing-house proofs
and testified to having put various figure*
on them. Mr. Hanna was asked severa 1
questions concerning -his methods of ex
amining a bank. It was .brought out
in his answers that he does not examine
the visible cash or assets of the bank to
see If it compares with the total amount.
Mr. Hanna said that In his examination
he found the clearing-house sheets, Al
vord's books and everything else ex
amined by him correct. He did not ex
amine everything- connected with the
bank, as it was not his duty to do so,
that being the duty of other examiners.
J. G. Garrison, a clerk in the note
teller's department, furnished the only
sensational testimony of the day. He di
rectly accused Alvord of changing the
clearing-house slip and swore that he
saw him do so. He said that he worked in
the same cage with Alvord and was about
twenty-five feet away from him. Describ
ing the examination of the clearing-house
sheets by Bank Examiner Hanna on Octo
ber 15 he said:
â¢ "I was about twenty-five feet away and
when the sheet was <?iven to Alvord I saw
him turn his back to the next man to him
and make some marks onÂ»the sheet. He
then went into his cage and made some
mere marks and then handed the sheets to
Mr. Hanna."
The hearing was aJJourned until Tues
day next.

, President William McKin
ley, Executive Mansion, Wash
ington, D. C: We respectfully
recommend the appointment of
F. S. Stratton to the position
of Collector of Customs at the
port of San Francisco.
GEORGE C. PERKINS,
THOMAS R. BARD,
THE foregoing message was j
wired to the President Thurs- j
day evening last. It is expected
that the President, In response
to the Senatorial recommenda
tion, will appoint Mr. Stratton to-day or
early next week. The agreement to
recommend Mr. Stratton was reached at
a conference of Senators Bard and Per
kins held at Los Angeles a few days be
fore the election. j
Incidents connected with the recommen- j
dation comprise an interesting political j
chapter. The death of Colonel J. P. Jack- I
son, late Collector of the Port, was sud
den and unexpected. The first candidate
for the vacant place was W. B. Hamil
ton, cashier of the Custom-house. He
was the favorite of Senator Perkins and
was backed by a strong mercantile in
dorsement. Other candidates were Joseph
S. Spear Jr., Surveyor of the Port; John
T. Dare, United States Appraiser, and E.
B. Jerome. Applications in behalf of
others were presented to the Senators.
Surveyor Spear was indorsed by Con
gressman Kahn. Irving M/ Scott, the Re
publican County Committee and many of
the leading commercial Institutions of
San Francisco, but he was not acceptable
i to the senior Senator. -
i There was a good deal ot talk to the
1 cftect that Major Frank McLaughlln. who
i was chairman of the Republican State
Central Committee In 1S9S. was an aspir
ont for the otnee, but the fact may be
stated that he never was a candidate for
public office, and he so stated when he
was interviewed on the subject of the
Collectorship. Nevertheless, s evera 1 _ of
hli- admiring friends urged his appoint
ment "and' his merits were discussed b>
flee creditably,. but no application for his
appointment was filed with the Senators
Colonel Stone declined to indorse any of
the applicants, holding that It would be
improper for the chairman of thecom
n.Jttee to intervene He advised that no
ai-polntment be made during the Presi
"wniie "the leveral applicants were circu
lating petitions and securing Indorse
ments Senator Bard came to San Fran
cisco and held interviews with Senator
Perkins. The latter Senator obtained the
impression that Senator Bard would never
cogent to recommend Mr. Hamilton. Mr.
Bard also received the Impression that
his colleague would never consent to rec
ommend Surveyor Spear. Appraiser John
T Dare, who was in New \ork when the
vacancy occurred, did not return home
until the Senators had practicall> agreed
to eliminate Federal otllce holders .rom
th Nodeflnlte action resulted from the In
terviews In San Francisco, but the Sena
tors aTd agree to defer recommendation
until after the election. It was under
stood that, if possible, they would agree
hofnre election and recommend Imme
diately after the result of the President^
battle was announced Accordingly the>
arranged to meet in Orange Count> dur
fng the last week of the campaign and
sojourning at the Occidental Hotel re
ceived visits from many members of the
Legislature who cordially supported h
cause at Sacramento They free y gaÂ«
him their views, insisting that the ap
pointee should be a representative of the
clean element of politics.
The name of Horace Davis was sug
gested to Senator Bard and the suggestion
was received with great favor. The
Senator was also favorably Inclined
toward Dr. Rowell of Fresno, but Senator
Perkins was not prepared to Indorse the
lntter as he preferred a business man or
San Francisco. His hesitation to Indorse
the former was based on the ground that
Mr Davis should be reserved for a posi
tion in the Cabinet. The name of Senator
Cutter of Yuba was mentioned, but he did
not possess the agreed qualification of
residence in this city.
In Los Angeles, shortly before the elec
tion, the discussion was renewed and the
field was narrowed down to Horace Davis
and F. S. Stratton. Neither one was a
candidate, but each was recognized as a
leading .Republican of eminent qualifica
tion and both were acceptable. When the
subject was presented to Horace Davis,
he expressed desire to relinquish work
rather than accept new responslbilties.
On, general review it was found that Air.
Stratton possessed rare gifts of Judgment
In his estimate of men. as shown In the
fact that he had. during the first session
of his term In the Legislature, voted to
send Senator Perkins to the United Stamen
Senate, and during his second term had
cast his vote to send Senator Bard thith
er. Ultimately it was decided to reserve
Horace Davis for higher position and give
the Collectorship to Mr. Stratton.
Day . before yesterday Senator Perkins
received a letter from Senator Bard. The
letter contained authority for the signa
ture of Senator Bard to the dispatch
transmitted to the President, as published
at the head .of this article. The recom
mendation was made after a prolonged
and careful study of the situation, and
both Senators believe that -the Indorse
ment, of Mr. Stratton will command the
apnroval of- the people of California-
Senator Stratton Is 41 years of ase. 'He
erariuated at the- TTnlverslty of California
In 1SS1. He is a religious man. but broad
gauged In his views. In Oakland he Is a
member of the Congregational church. In
Francisco he Is a member of; the Bohe
mian Club. He prepared himself for ad
mission to the bar in the office of Latl
mer & Morrow and later in the offi>e of
General W. H. L. Barnes. After admis
sion to the bar. he formed a partnership
with W. W. Morrow. He wan frequently
engaged in important artmiraltv cases and
certainly f derived ; knowledge that will be
useful to him as Collector of the Port.
He served four years as attorney for the
State Board .. of Harbor Commissioners.
He .was elected to the State. Senate in
1S96 and voted Â¦ for Georgre C. â¢ Perkins for
United States Senator. In the last regu
lar* session of the Legislature he was an
earnest and consistent sunporter of Gen
eral Barnes for the United States Senate.
When the extra session convened he took
an active part in organizing forces fa
vorable to the election of Thomas R.
Bard. Senator Stratton's legislative ca
reer is highly creditable. He gained in
fluence by reason of his Industry and
ability.
. There never was the slightest question
as to Ms integrity of character. His great
est work iiv the Legislature was applied
to the enactment of a primary election
law. He was so active In this work that
the act was known as the Stratton prim
ary lav/. The law was what the people
wanted, but the Supreme Court declared
it unconstitutional. In every sense he 13
a representative of clean politics and hon
est government, and his appointment
should add strength to the cause of re
form in the public service.
AJameda County is again the favored
region. Politicians refer to the fact that
the Superintendent of the Mint. Naval Of
ficer, Register of the Land Office and
Commissioner of Immigration reside In
that county.
The following dispatch from Washing
ton foreshadows early action on the rec
ommendation of Senators Bard and Per
kins.
VAtfHIXUTOX. Nov. 9.â Fred S. Stratton
will be the next Collector of Port of San
Francisco. He has been indorsed by Senators
Perkins and Bard. Papers are now in the
hiiMls of Secretary Gage and will be taken to
the White House for the President's consid
eration to-morrow. It Is not Improbable that
the appointment will be made immediately un
less some unexpected opposition is raised. '
CONGRESSMEM' NOT PLEASED.
Loud and Kahn Think Entire Delega-
tion Should Have Made Choice.
Congressmen Kahn and Loud, whose
constituents include the business men of
San Francisco, who above all others are
Interested In the appointment of the right
man, do not hesitate to express indirectly
their displeasure at the action of the two
Senators. Neither will say anything
against Mr. Strattcn's fitness, but each
talks freely of the fact that the delega
tion of Congressmen has been ignored,
contrary to long established precedent,
and that a lawyer has been appointed in,
spite of a general nnd well known desire
that a business man of experience should
be- Felected.
"The Information of the action of Sen
ators Perkins and Bard," Congressman
Kahn said last evening, "comes as a great
surprise to me. I had not even heard
Senator Stratton's name mentioned. I
had read that. Senator Bard had said that
none of the men whose names had been
mentioned for the appointment would be
chosen, but I did not know the two Sen
ators -had. a greed upon any one. .
"I do not know whether or not other
members of the delegation have been con
sulted, but I know that I have not. I am
not entirely sure what the custom has
bejen, but it has been my understanding
that the entire delegation took recom
mendations for Federal appointments un
der advisement.
"A large number of San Francisco mer
chants have expressed to me the hope
that some practical business man of wide
experience would be chosen for the office,
and I have teen urged to use my Influence
to secure such an appointment. That I
was willing and anxious to do, but of
course if Mr. Stratton Is already appoint
ed, that settles it."
"I have not the pleasure of Mr. Strat
ton's acquaintance." Congressman Loud
said, "but presumably he is well qualified
to fill the office. As neither Mr. Kahn nor
myself was consulted. I take It for grant
ed that none of the Republican Congress
men were asked for an opinion in the mat
ter. If Mr. Stratton Is appointed the in
cident Is closed, but not In accordance
with precedent in this State.
"I have been a member of Congress for
ten years, and during that time the entire
delegation has not only conferred but haa
balloted upon recommendations for Fed
eral appointments. It was so when Stan
ford and Felton were Senators. Take, for
illustration, the appointment of John C
Qulnn In 1891 as Collector of Internal Rev
enue/ I was in San Francisco at the time
and the other four Republican members
of the delegation were tied, two and two
on the appointment. Stanford favored a
Berkeley man. They wired me and I cast
the deciding vote for Qulnn.
: "So It has been throughout my ten
years in Congress. Senator Perkins was
glad enough to have the delegation rec
ommend Colonel Jackson, for he was
afraid Mr. Snear would be appointed in
spite of his opposition. I admit that In
some Eastern States such appointments
are made upon recommendation of the
Senators alone, but in many more the en
tire delegation caucuses on the appoint
ment. That certainly Is the precedent
that has ruled in the matter of California
appointments."

of the Banner to San Francesco.
Mr. Choate Replies.
Saturday evening of next week has been
settled upon as the time for the surrender
by the Oakland Alliance of the Repub
lican banner. San Francisco and Ala
meda counties wfll unite in the ceremony
and will combffie with it a general Jollifi
cation over the Republican landslide.
Colonel Stone, chairman of the State
Central Committee; A. T. Booth, presi
dent of the Union League Club; Tirey L.
Ford, chairman of the committee on
political activity of the Union Leasjue
Club, and Alfred Bouvier and John F. Mc-
Glynn, chairman and secretary respec
tively of the County Central Committee,
had a conference yesterday and decided
upon the general features of the occasion.
The jollification will be held in Me
chanics' Pavilion. All the Republican
clubs of San Francisco will participate
and each will march to the Pavilion in a
body. There the banner will be duly pre
sented and received and speeches will be
made in honor of San Francisco's ach'Â»vÂ»>
ment and in celebration of the Republican
triumph in the State and nation.
As the Union League Club is the only
Republican organization with permanent
and long-established quarters, it will
probably be chosen as custodian of the
silken trophy.
A meeting of the directors of the Union
League Club will be held at 1 o'clock to
day to arrange the details of the celebra
tion and the transfer of the banner.
The committees have already been ap
pointed by Al?meda County to make ar
rangements for the surrender of the ban
ner. The County Committee has ap
pointed A. II. Breed. Clarence Crowell
and W. W. Morrison to act and the Oak
land Alliance has appointed Felton Tay
lor, C. A. Bon. Samuel J. Taylor and
Senator-elect O. R. Lukens to consult
with Colcnel Georgre Stone in regard to
the transfer from Alameda to San Fran
cisco.
The suggestion of a Republican Inlllfl
catlon. made through the' columns of The
Call by a correspondent. William F.
Palmer, has been received with great fa
vor throus-hout San Francisco and the
event in Mechanics' Pavilion will doubt
less cause an unprecedented outoouriner
of enthusiastic Republicans. Mr. Palmer's
reference in his communication to hH

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VIRGINIA CITY, Nov. 9.â James Kiger
was shot and- killed by II. M. Clemons in
Nigger Ravine, near Silver City, at 11
o'clock this mcrnlng. The shooting v.-as
the result cf a difficulty over the owner
ship of a mining claim called the "Corry
J." in which Clemens and Kiger were
equally interested, demons, who at one
time owned all of the Corry j, had grub
staked Kiger and given him a half inter
est in the mine to develop it. A short
time ago Kiger assaulted a man named
White, who was employed in the mine by
Clemons. Clemor.s offered to buy tiie
mine, but Kiger refused to sell or" make
any sort of a settlement.
This morning: Clemons went to Nigger
Ravine to inspect another mining prop
erty and passed clcse to the Corry J.
Kiger was on the dump and Clemons and
he greeted one another pleasantly. 'Kiger
had just dumped a carload of ore an-1
Clemons remarked upon its excellence,
saying that he supposed Kiger would give
him his share after it was milled.
"Not a damned cent," said Kiger.
Clemons then started across the dump
with a sample sack, presumably to get
some samples of the ore.
".Let that alone," demanded Kiger, who
drew a revolver and began shooting.
Clemons returned the fire and a bullet hit
Kiger in the head, between the chin an.i
lower lip, inflicting a mortal wound.
Kiger displayed remarkable grit and
vitality, following Clemons up a hill and
firing two mere snots, one of which grazed
Clemons' armpit. Kiger then reeled down
the hill again, his footsteps marking an
almost perfect circle from his starting
place, and fell face forward upon a pile
of rocks. Clemons followed him and lifted
his head and a moment later Kiger ex
pired in the arms of the man who had
shot him.
Clemons at once came to Virginia 1 City
and gave himself up. He is now in the
County Jail, where he will remain to
await the action of the Justice Court. It
Is thought he will be exonerated on the
ground of self-defense.
The affair, created intense excitement
on the Comstock.
Clemons is superintendent of the Vir
ginia and Gold Hill Water Company and
stands high in fraternal circles.

POSTUM CEREAL.
Any one interested in thin subject would
be greatly Furprised to make a systematic
inquiry among prominent brain workers
In America. There are hundreds of thou-
sands of our most prominent people that
have abandoned coffee altogether and are
using Postum m Food Coffee in its place,
and for the most excellent reasons in the
world. Many of them testify that III
health, nervous prostration, and conse-
quent inability to work haa in times past
pushed them back and out of their proper
standing in life, whicli they have been
Â«blc to regain by the use of good health,
strong nerves and great vitality, since
coffee ha* been thrown out and the Pot-
turn put la its place.
They will solemnly pledge to themselves
&ay after day that they will abandon the
use of it when they know that it is short-
ening their days, but morning after morn-
Ing: they fail, until they grow to despise
themselves for their lack of control.
This Is only a small percentage of th<?
jrreat Variety of diseases -which come from
en unbalanced r.ervous system, caused by
the persistent daily use of the drug caf-
feine, which is the active principle of cof-
fÂ«"Â». Another bit of prima facie evidence
about coffee is that the victims to the
habit find great difficulty in giving it up.
It would be Just as reasonable for a
tpmrK-ra-nce advocate to drink a little di-
luted whisky as to drink coffee, for one
la as truly an Intoxicant as the other, and
p*>r?JFtence In the uÂ»e of coffee bring-s on
a variety of chronic diseases, notorious
among which are dyspepsia, heart palpi-
tation (ard ultimately heart failure), fre-
quently constipation, kidney diseases,
many case? of w^k ryes and trembling

Though the San Mateo Hunt Club haa
already had two runs this fall, at^he first
of which about thirty people were pres
ent and at the second more than twenty,
the season's sport has not yet officially
begun. The ground is still so hard that
the owners of valuable hunters are disin
clined to risk their horses until more rain
has fallen and the going is softer. Frank
Carolan, the master of the Hunt Club, and
Peter Martin, one of its best known mem
bers, are hunting in the Tennessee Val
ley. New York State, but a programme
covering until the end of the present
month has been prepared. The meet to
day will be at El Ceriito Park, San Ma
teo. at 2 p. m. Next Saturday the meet
will be at 9:30 a. m. at Fair Oaks and on
Saturday, the 24th lnst., at the same place.
On Thanksgiving- day the hounds will
throw off at Prince Poniatowskl's place,
the Burlingame Stock Farm, at 9:30 in the
morning. The pack now includes twelve
couples in working condition. Six addi
tional couples are to be sent out from Ire
land and the master of tho hunt has al3o
purchased Fix couples in New York, which
will be added to the pack at San Mateo.
The latter are American bred hounds,
which are generally considered faster
than English bred ones, though not pos
sessing so much stamina and endurance.
HUNT CLUB PREPARES

The board of directors of the San Fran
cisco Kennel Club recently held a meet
ing at which Thomas H. Williams Jr., E.
Courtney Ford and Colonel Walter S.

Bert Wyman and Jack Lemer shot at
Shermans Island on Sunday. Bert Wy
man's frioiids are preparing some gas
tronomlc entertainment in his honor on
account of this, his own record breaking
shoot. Wyman got a string of fourteen.
At Willow. Lodge the usual run of good
luck showed itself this week, and at Ai
varado and Alviso the shooting Is Im
proving.
\V. s>. Kittle. Henry Nichols. Henry
Miller and O. H. Hopke shot at Tubbs
Island last Sunday, with fair success.
Snipe are very plentiful this year, and
many of the gunners are training their
barrels on this small bird instead of the
broad bill. On the Country Club preserves
in Martn County and on tho bay marshes
snipo abound.
This is a great season for quail. In
Sonoma and Marin counties tha shooters
reach the limit allowed by law early in
the day. "It is no trick to go out and
bring back a bag of twenty-fivÂ© at tho
Country Club," says w. S. Kittle. And
the came happy expressions come from
the San Mateo direction.
On Sunday the Field and Tule Club had
a poor shoot on its ponds near Cordelia.
To offset this H. B. Hosmer, Al Cum
mir.jrs and Fred Bushnell tried their luck
again en Wednesday. A string of 105 birds
was the result, Hosmer being high man
with 47, while CumminRS ran a close sec
ond. To-morrow the Cordelia ponds will
be occupied by Messrs. Titus, Unger, Bell
and Hopke.
The duck shooters, while participating
In alternate good and poor shoots, arc
satisfied with the sport at present, for thÂ«>
best of all birds, the canvasback, is be
ginning to show on the marshes. Last
Sunday the returns were very light, but

The Sausalito Golf Club will hold Its
first formal tournament this afternoon,
play beginning- on the links In the mili
tary reservation near Fort Baker as soon
as possible after the arrival of. the 1:45
p. m. boat from San Francisco. The

the qualifying: rounds, over . eighteen
holes, medal play, for the championship
events will be played to-day. The open
ing rounds in the actual contests, over

It is understood that David Bell of Mid
lothian, professional golf champion of
the United States, and Willie Smith, for
merly open champion, will make a win
ter tour of the Pacific Coast, playing their

The work upon the gridiron diirlnp the
past wrek ha* been light. After the ex

against Reliance Saturday enme a lapse
from heavy practice till Thursday, when
the second team met the big eleven In oie
Of the hottest practice games of the sea
son. The result was a touchdown for e,ach
team, though ihe scrubs made the strong
est showing. Xaramnre proved that the
Varsity's defense was not invulnerable by
breaking through its line for a forty-yard
run. Other men on the second team
who are pleasing the coaches by
their work are Gregory at center,
Wardall at tackle and Parker at
full. Yost is pretty well satisfied for the
present with the offensive work of the
Varsity and is devoting his attention to
matters of defense. The linemen lack the
aptitude to g-Â»t In under their opponents*
plays, while the backs and ends are slow
in asi-istingand are by no means sure in
tnekiing.
The IJst of injured players has been re
duced by the reappearance of Slaker.
Geissler and De Forest. Though neither
of the three will take part in Saturday's
game, they are able to go through brisk
signal practice. Allen, who has taken
Hill's place at half since the latter went
to fullback? position. Is playing a good
game. These two men. together with
Smith, will compose Stanford's trio of
backs to-morrow against Oregon.
The linemen have shown the most rapid
improvement In the last two weeks. Cen
ter is probably giving the coaches the
most worry. Gregory, the two-hundred
pound freshmsn. who cannot enter the
Varsity li.n on account of being In special
standing, is playlns a phenomenal game
for a first year man. Seeley. Traeger and
Burnett are fast and aggressive, often
breaking through to block plays or tackle
behind the line. â¢ <
The fight for end places is still a three
cornered one between McFadden. Cooper
and Luck, with chances about even. Luck
has made a great Improvement recently
He is fast In getting down the field and a
sure tackier.

JACK KANE WINS FROM
TTTRNER ON A FOUL
Colored Han Was Outclassed and
Persisted in Illegal Tactics
Throughout the Fight.
DENVER, Nov. 9.â Jack Kane and Eu
gene Turner (colored), both of San Fran
cisco, fought before the Olympic Club
here to-night, Kane winning on a foul in
the third round. The bout was scheduled
for ten rounds, and Kane had decidedly
the better of it and would have whipped
his man fairly had the tight continued.
The few leads that Turner attempted
were easily blocked by Kane, and In the
second round Kane nearly finished the
business with several killing punches over
Turner's kidneys. After that Turner
tried to choke off Kane's wind and In
dulged in further foul tactics. In the
third round he threw his arms around
Kane's neck and pulled him to the floor,
falling upon his head heavily. He then
proceeded to punch Kane while holding
him on the floor, and Referee Cullen
pulled him off and awarded the fight
to Kane.
â¢ Kane was very anxious to have the fight
continue, and in this was urged on by the
crowd, which hooted and Jeered Turner
as he stood in his corner. Cullen would
not consent to allow the fight te go on,
and the police stepped In and cleared the
ring, and thereby prevented what threat
ened to terminate In serious trouble.
Turner succeeded In persuading Kane
to shake hands with him before tney left
the ring. Rufe Turner of Stockton, Cal.,
challenged the winner of the fight.

Albert M. Harmon's Attempt to End
His Life Likely to Prove
Successful.
CLOVERDAI.E. Nov. 9.â Albert M. Har
mon, aged CS years, attempted suicide this
morning by taking strychnine. He is
alive, but his recovery Is doubtful.
Harmon came to California with his
father and three brothers in 1S50 from
Missouri. He mined for several years
and moved to Mendoc'no County about
thirty years ago. The brothers returned
to Missouri. Harmon yesterday requested
Marsha! Orr to call at Ms house at 10
o'clock this morning. He conversed
cheerfully for awhile and then offered Orr
his watch, saying he would have no fur
ther use for it. Orr refused to accept It.
but when requested to take It for his boy
he did so. When he called at th* cabin
this morning he found Harmon In con
vulsions.
Harmon was taken to the County Hos
pital at Santa Ro?a this afternoon by
Marshal Orr. â¢ *

'WASHINGTON. Nov. 9.â Frank W.
Funk was hanged at the district Jail tor
NEW YORK, Nov. 9.â In connection
with the answer of Mayor Van Wyck to
the charges against him filed with Gov
ernor Roosevelt regarding his alleged Im
proper connection with the American IcÂ«
Company, the World to-day prints a tele
gram purporting to have been sent by B.
B. Odell, chairman of the Republican
State Committee and nominee of the Re
publican State Convention for Governor,
to Roosevelt, as follows:
"September 26, 1000. To Theodore Rooee
velt. Governor of New York, Cripple
Creek, Colorado. Wire Attorney General
Davies to be sure not to give out to the
reporters the Van Wyck answer at this
time. It must be held until after the elec
tion fs over. This would imperil us and
get us Into a useless tangle. I have also
wired Davies. B. B. ODEL.U"
A reporter called on Governor Roose
velt at his home In Oyster Bay to-day and
asked him as to the genuineness of the
telegram given above. The Governor de
clined to make any statement beyond call
ing attention to the fact that about ten
days before election he had said to news
paper reporters that there was no possible
objection to Mayor Van Wyck giving out
his answer. As far as he was concerned,
the usual custom would be followed, and
the answer together with any communi
cation with the Attorney General would
be made public at the same time the de
cision was given out.
Mr. Odell was asked at his home
in Newburgh to-day to affirm or deny the
authenticity of the telegram, but refused
to make any statement at this time.
In the letter of Attorney General Da
vies to Governor Roosovelt. dated Octo
ber 4, communicating the answer of May
or Wyck, the Attorney. General says: !
The -layor by his answ6r admits that
during his incumbency of th,e office he
has been the owner of shares of stock In
the American Ice Company. He also ad
mits that during the period in which he
was the owner of stock the American Ice
Company had contracts with the city for
the sale of Ice to various departments of
the city and for the leasing of docks be
longing to th* city. In my opinion the
owner of stock in the corporation is in
terested within the meaning of that word
as employed in section 1533 of the Greater
New York charter in a contract between
the corporation and the city."
Further on in his letter to the Governor
the Attorney General says: "In order to
justify the Mayor's removal I do not be
lieve that it Is necesary to establish a
case against him upon which he could be
convicted of a torm under the provisions
of section 1533 above referred to. but I do
believe there should be clear and satis
factory evidence of his moral guilt.
"It is of the utmost importance that no
further proceedings should be taken in
this matter unless you are satisfied that
the charges can be sustained. The Mayor
of the greatest city in America should not
be humiliated by being placed upon trial
upon charges which are groundless and
which ' cannot be proved. Under these
circumstances and in view of the fact
that the charges are made upon informa
tlon and belief, and considering the great
expense both to the Mayor and the
H ta^ e K Ir i Volved in ' s1J ch a trial. I believe
that before a commissioner is appointed
or ajiy further proceedings taken in the
matter, you should require the petitioners
v,.^ 06 . 1 ' 0^, in P osse sÂ»ion of evidence
â¢ m 4 sta " din 5 al Â°ne and undisputed
would Justify the removal of the Mayor
In my Judgment the Mayor's answer
should not be made puhlic at this time. Ai
I have already stated iis denials and alle
gations are clear and txpllcit and it might
a i Â°i n i Ce K be^. su ?Bested that the charges
should be dismissed or that a commis
sioner should at once be appointed and the
Mayor given a speedy opportunity to ex
onerate himself.
\ou are powerless to act in this matter
during your absence from this State
iou cannot appoint a commissioner until
you reach this State and I am Informed
that Mr Woodniff will decline to SSâ¢he
responsibility of appointing one."
Governor-elect Odell came to this city
to-night and when asked about the tele
gram said to have been sent by him to
Governor Roosevelt to suppress the an
swer of Mayor Van Wyck to tho '*ce
trust" charges said: e
r^"^! 1 ? t^S lle ? ed lele Sram is signed 'B. B.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 9.â Bishop Henry
C. Potter of New York testified to-day be
fore the Industrial Commission. He spokÂ©
on sweat shops, arbitration and other
questions. He said he had more confi
dence In voluntary organizations to meet
evils that grow out of the sweat shops,
systems than in legislation. He advocated
a permanent commission to mediate be
tween capitalists and labor organizations,
and was disinclined to favor compulsory
arbitration. With .reference to the recent
anthracite coal strike, the Bishop was
asked for his remedy for differences where
employers absolutely reject every attempt
at mediation with employes, especially
where the public at large would suffer
from the cessation of operations incident
to the dispute.
"I know no coercive measure that I
could recommend to meet such a condi
tion," he replied.
He placed more value In sound public
opinion solving the trouble than any co
ercive measures and thought the remedy
really lay in the intelligent organization
of labor. Compulsory arbitration, he con
ceded, was less an evil than a long- strike
or a lockout. He commended the disposi
tion of worklngmen to accept any sugges
tion looking to settlements with employ
ers. There was a general feeling among
employers, he said, in favor of organiza
tion among employes, attributable both
to a spirit of fairness and a preference to
deal with a responsible union rather than
with individuals.
He commended the organization of
chambermaids in the West to ascertain
the solvency and character of employers.
Labor, he said. Is not well rewarded vol
untarily by any one. That was the key
note of the labor question.

SPOKANE, Wash., N'ov. 9.\v dispatch
from Wilbur, Wash., to-night tells the
story of a tragedy as the result of a
feud of long standing. In which one man
was killed about a year ago and his slayer
bled to death Wednesday afternoon from
the effects of a bullet sent by the aveng
ing brother of the man who was murdered
last year.
Wednesday, afternoon a team owned by
David Speegle walked slowly into town
drawing a wagon. Lying over the side
of the wagon box was the body of
Speegle. His life blood had spurted over
the wheels and upon the side of the
wagon. He was still breathing, but died
soon after being taken from the wagon.
A terrible hole in th.e neck showed the
cause of his death.
Speegle was hauling gravel from an ad
jacent hill to Wilbur and the day after
election took Ed Beardon with him to the
pit. On the last trip Mr. Beardon was
seated on the wagon with him. The team
was coming down a hill and Speegle had
the reins in one hand and the rope con
nected with the brake in the other.
When nearly at the bottom of the hill
William Phoenix rode up to the two men.
He immediately pulled a revolver and
commenced tiring. Twice he hit Speegle,
one shot passing through the abdomen
and the other inflicting a ghastly wound
in the neck.
Beardon jumped from the wagon and
ran for his life. Speegle fell over the
side of the wagon, but his body was held
in by the seat. The horses proceeded to
town with the wagon, keeping to the
road. The blood from the wounds left a
gory trail to town. Phoenix rode to Hell
Oate Canyon, where he is residing.
Two years ago Speegle, who was over
fond of the society of married women,
became so attentive to the wife of one of
the Phoenix boys that they remonstrated.
A quarrel followed, in which Speegle shot
and killed the husband and the brother
has been waiting ever since to kill
Speegle.
Wilbur people sympathize with the
Phoenix family.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, Xov. 9.â An alarming report
reached Redding this evening to the ef
fect that the great .Iron Mountain mine
was on fire in every level. If wholly true
this would have meant the greatest dis
aster that had ever befallen . Shasta
County. It has since been ascertained
that only one level is burning, known as
the Peck tunnel. â¢
The fire was discovered yesterday at 1
o'clock. One hundred men who were
working in that level were laid off that
afternoon. There are no facilities at
hand to Hood the level with water and so
far as is known at this hour the manage
ment is forced to let the tire take its
course, for the present at least. Work la
still proceeding in all the other levels.
It was the fact of being compelled to
Â¦work ten-hour shifts In the excessive heat
of the Peck tunnel which precipitated the
recent strike that spread to ail parts of
the mine, causing a complete suspension
of work and throwing out over 360 men.
The strike failed and was called off.
it is supposed that the waste lime rock,
used to till in worked-out portions of the
mine, becoming saturated with moisture,
generated enough heat to ignite the tim
bers left standing in the ltiled in. drifts.
This is the only explanation that mining
mer\ ; acquainted with the situation here
have' to offer. The ore contains a large
percentage of sulphur and burns readily
wheittignited in the open-atr roasters.
Th^ tunnel is the upper of three
levels driven in on the side of the moun
tain. It is connected by a shaft with
the next level below, known as the Copper
level. It was in this tunnel that nine
men lost their lives by a cave-In some
months ago. The intense heat that has
bothered the miners in the Peck tunnel is
absent in the Copper level and it. is be
lieved that the fire will not be communi
cated from the upper to the succeeding
level.
Appearances indicate that the mine
management is not much alarmed over
the situation. The lire, even should it
assume graver proportions, cannot affect
the smelting plant by shutting: off the ore
supply fÂ«r a long time to come. A com
filete suspension of work, which is entire
y improbable, would be most disastrous
to the prosperity of Shasta County.
No Alarm at the Situation, as It Is
Believed the . Flames Can Be
Confined to -the Point
of Origin.

WHEN THANKSGIVING
COMES
** " * o^t^TTg hT. IThe local traffic in human Japanese chattels seems
to have met with a serious reverse in the resignation
of one of the employes of the Immigration Bureau.
The fault appears to have rested with several interest
ing persons who evaded the usual payment for slaves.
The Spanish revolutionists, who have been killing
one another of late. h?.ve at least that satisfaction
which attends a triumph of arms, although the vic
tory iÂ« at the rxpen>e of national honor. Even
Uncle S?.n has not been able to make the Spaniards
behave themselves. . ,
Defeated political candidates can now return to
their places in reputable society from which they were
thrown. The bombardment of the political orators
has ceased, and the human targets, riddled but still
reputable, have an opportunity to recorer from the
fire of oratorical artillery.
In the whirl of gratification and enthusiasm with
vhich the people of the United States have signalize!
their pleasure at the re-election of McKinley a pros-
IÂ»ective benefit of immense moment has been over
looked. William Jennings Bryan says he stifled his
aspiration to be President.
It is to* Chamberlain the Tories look for leadership
j in the movement for protection. He would have had
Notwithstanding the aid given by Laurier and Cana
; diah Liberals to the Conservative Government at
, London in the South African war, the British Tories
! desired the success of Sir Charles Tupper, leader of
j the Conservatives in Canada. The chief reason for
that desire is that the average British Tory has devel
; oped a very strong sentiment in favor of establishing
i a system of protection throughout the empire, and it
: was believed that had Tupper attained power in Can
! ?da he would have strongly supported such a policy.
Even since the defeat of Canadian Conservatism it
J is by no means certain that some effort will not be
'made in the direction of protection. The London
j Chronicle in commenting upon a speech recently
I made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer before the
j Liverpool Chamber of Commerce says: "There are
! plenty of men in the Tory party who are as protec
tionist to-day as Lord George Bentinck was half a
j century ago. They have a profound belief in pro
j hibitive and preferential tariffs, in the ring-fence and
: differential duties, which they are pleased to call 'fair
I trade.' They would r.ot hesitate to tax the food of
: the people, so long as it came from Germany, or Rus
sia, or the United States, though they might be pru
; dent enough to say that the tax was 'for revenue
only.' "
There is no harmony of political sentiment among
the three Governments. McKinley stands in this
Â¦ country for Liberalism, while Salisbury is a Tory of
' the stalwart kind. Laurier is known to Canadian
i politics as a Liberal, and. while he has been in syni
| pathy with Salisbury's imperial policy, has no affilia
( tion with what is known as Conservatism in Britain.
: Thus the only thing in common': among the people of
i the three countries which led them to sustain the ex
1 isting Governments is a satisfaction with the existing
i order of things and a desire to maintain the prevail-
CANADA has voted to sustain the administra
tion. Like the people of the United States and
those of Great Britain, the Canadians desire no
change in their Government. The three great repre
sentatives of the English-speaking world stand, there
fore, as a unit for that kind of progress which is
called conservative. Laurier at Ottawa, as McKinley
at Washington and Salisbury at London, will continue
to direct the affairs of his people.
BRITISH PROTECTIONISTS
in the departments which the waxen lady
makes her stamping-ground and that
other men frequently accompany their
wives on shopping tours and view the al
lurements of the depraved dummies was
also dwelt upon. The decision was Im
mediate.
Mrs. Addle and Mrs. Martin were ap
pointed a committee to visit the various
haunts of the pink and white impropriety
and to request the removal of the objects
of their censure. The matter will be
pushed with all the energy of women In
terested in social purity, and la bound to
have results.
The mitigating circumstances of the
waxen lady's wooden waist and the suc
cession of Iron hoops that supply her lack
of lower extremities have had no soften
ing effect upon her Judges. The abbre
viated beauties who float around In hair
dressers' windows and vanish In a bow at
the waist are likewise under the ban.
They affect low-cut bodices and are there
fore "Improper." Even the headless va
riety is regarded with suspicion.
The temperance women have as yet sug
gested no substitute for these disturbing
Images, but the probability is that It mu3t
be a clothes-horse respectably draped.
NEW YORK. Nov. 9.â That the
waxen ladles who boldly dis
play their charms In the shops
are Immodest In their tenden
cies, improper In their wearing
apparel and hurtful to the morals of the
community Is the latest discovery of the
Demorest Union of the W. C. T. U.. which
will straightway start a crusade apalnst
the sinful possibilities of the glass-eyed
sisterhood.
At the reg-ular meeting held a few days
apo at the home of Mrs. Annie Thomas. In
West Seventy-second street, the matter
was broupht up for discussion, and the
waxen enchantresses were condemned
with enthusiastic unanimity. Mrs. Addle
pointed out that the decolletage of the
pink and white beauties used as models
for evening gowns In the department
stores was revolting to a modest mind. Its
effect upon the "young person" was ob
vious. The desire to emulate such liberal
revelation of contour might be implanted
unawares, and altogether the expose of
the waxen lady was on a par with erotic
literature and Improper pictures.
Mrs. Emllie D. Martin also took up the
theme. The fact that men are employed
The promise contained in the ntw system does not
imply that every home will have good bread, for if
Dr. Wiley be correct we can never have that so long
a= household cooks arc permitted to bake bread. He
says: "The domestic making of bread is to be de
plored. Bread making is as much an art as tailoring,
and we have as much right to bread made by experts
as we have to coats r.nd gowns fashioned by tailors.
In fact, a ready-made suit keeps you warm, even if
its fit is .not faultless, but bread badly made has not
a leg on which to stand. An earnest effort, should be
made to relegate domestic bread making to the past
and to institute in every community bakeries under
competent control offering the best bread at the low
est price."
The use of bread made by the new system is said to
have spread rapidly in Paris. Dr. Wiley says: "At
first the prejudice of the consumer for the white loaf
has to be overcome, inasmuch as bread made from
the flour of the new system, while not dark in color,
has quite a yellowish tint, which at once distinguishes
it from ordinary bread. When one eats this bread,
however, it is found to be so palatable, so nutritious
and so aromatic that no other kind is desired." It
is added: "Chemical analyses show that the flour
made by the system has more than twice as much
phosphatic material 'as that made by the ordinary
roller process."
The exhibits for the new system included a large
plant for supplying bread to a populous community,
another for use in a small village, a third intended for
use on a farm, the mill being driven by hand much as
a cofTee-mill is run; and, finally, an exhibit of a mill
on wheels, to be drawn by horses or by automobile,
for the purpose of supplying an army with fresh
biead while on the march. *
Dr. Wiley says: "Among all the exhibits of bread
and bread making at the Paris Exposition the one
which interested me most was a system of milling
and baking combined. This system has a double pur
pose â (i) to make the flour more palatable and more
nutritious than that made by the ordinary roller mill;
(2) to make it immediately before baking, so as to
Secure for the loaf a flour which is absolutely fresh.
It is well known that all food substances when ground
to a fine powder have a tendency to become oxidized.
As is the case with coffee, which is best when freshly
roasted and freshly ground, so it is with cereal flour,
which is never so aromatic, so palatable or so nu
tritious as at the moment when it is first made."
DR. HARVEY W. WILEY, chief chemist of the
Department of Agriculture, having been
asked by the editor of the Forum to contribute
to that review an article on some interesting feature
of the Paris Exposition, chose bread making for his
subject, and the public is to be congratulated on the
choice, for Dr. Wiley furnishes in his paper good rea
sons for believing the long desire for sweet, nutritious,
vholesonie bread is about to be realized.
BREAD MAKING EXTRAORDINARY.
PINK AND WHITE WICKEDNESSES. WHOSE WAXEN PROPORTIONS
ARE SAID TO BE A SURE MENACE TO THE YOUTH OF GAY
NEW YORK.
The issue raised by the offenses of these men should
rot be permitted to pass unnoted. Honest politics
concerns every citizen. Dishonesty is a menace to
;<!1. Consequently the public will look to the authori
ties to rebuke the misconduct of the offenders in \
i:Â»anner that trill be a lesson to all of their kind in the
f-;ture. The mrn should be dismissed from an office
nf which they have shown themselves unworthy.
Since they work for the boÂ«seÂ« instead of for the Stat:,
they Â«hould be removed from the State payrolls and
1' ft to pet their pay from the bosses they serve.
That these men should openly ally themselves with
l/osses who are knoA-n to be thoroughly corrupt an-i
hhould work with them to defeat Republican candi
<^tes <v>n?tituteÂ« one of the gravest offenses known
to politics. The aim of all good citizens is to elimi
nate boss rule from both pr.rties. for it is well known
that the bosses fight together to defeat honest men.
i:o matter by which yÂ»arty nominated. A considerable
j ortion of the Democratic push helped Crimmins and
Kelly to break into Republican primaries, and it now
rppears that the favor Â«-aÂ« returned by the activity of
Kelly nnd Crimmins in helping Raincy and Phclan in
making the fight against Mr. Xe'son. the Republican
candidate in the Twenty-fifth. It is therefore with no
little indignation the better class of citizens learn that
< mplojrs of the State, drawing payment from th
money of the taxpayers, were willing tools in help
ing the combined bosses defeat Mr. Nelson.
( H :he three offenders Buckley is perhaps the most
offensive, for he i? not only a servant of the State
placed in his position by the Republican party, but
i 1 also :: rr.eiiiber of the Republican State Central
Committee. He is therefore bound by political honor
:.t well :t* by official position to be true to the interests
of the party which has honored him with a place in
The weight of the offense of these men consists
not in the fact that they supported a Democrat
against a Republican candidate, but that they con
spired with such corrupt bosses as Crimmin^ and
Kelly and Raincy and Fhelan to defeat the election
<â¢:' an honest man who had been nominated as a can
<''<":.:tp of genuine Republicanism. The State of
California cannot afford to maintain on its payrolls
â¢men who neglect the work of the State in order to do
crooked politics with the worst elements of the city.
The task which honesty has in fighting the slum
bosses, backed by the railroad and the Democratic
combine, i* difficult enough without having the money
of the State used to support the tools of the gang.
DURING the campaign that has just closed two
onice-holders of the State, who owe their posi
tions to the Republican party, were actively
cn^aped in doing the work of disreputable bosses by
â¢ . :::;g the Republican candidate for State Senator
in the Twenty-fifth District. The two are E. M.
Buckley and M. A. Smith, both of whom are
wharfingers drawing pay from the State. There is a
third wharfinger. al*o. Mike Barry, who is reported to
Live asi-i^erl the others, in the fight. The two who are
known to be guilty should be discharged, and if Barry
be found equally engaged in the arong he fhouid
share the same fate.
TOOLS CF THE BOSSES.
Tariff acts, like all other fiscal measures, are to be
judged by their results, and when so judged the Porto
Rican tariff fully sustains the reputation of the Re
publican party for constructive statesmanship. The
Bryanites were foolish in making even an attempt to
obtain judgment against the administration upon that
act, and displayed more wisdom than usual with them
in dropping the issue. The tariff is working well, and
since such good results in the way of increased tade
have been effected in the first five months in spite of
the drawbacks of the great hurricane, it is reasonable
to expect in the near future a showing that will be
gratifying in every respect.
'In considering the significance of these statistics it
is to be borne in mind it was generally believed the
showing of trade for the first year under the tariff
would be small by reason of the hurricane of last
y.ear, which proved so damaging to the chief indus
tries of the island. The losses occasioned by the
storm, it was thought, would leave the Porto Ricans
little to sell and consequently too poor to buy much.
The Bureau of Statistics has published a table show
ing the trade between Porto Rico and the United
States during May, June, July, August and Septem
ber of 1896. 1897, 1899 and 1900, respectively, and the
total for each period, and thus enables a comparison
by months and by the entire period both with 1899,
when the island was under the American flag but sub
ject to the general customs' laws of the United States,
and with 1896 and 1897, when it was Spanish terri
tory. Every month since the enactment of the new
taw shows a marked increase over 1899 and a still
greater increase as compared with 1897 and 1896;
while the total imports from the island in the five
months of 1000 show an increase of 62 per cent over
1809 and 172 per cent over 1897, and the exports to
the island show an increase of 104 per cent over 1899
and 265 per cent over 1897.
The Porto Rican tariff went into effect May I, and
the record of the first five months of its operation has
just been made public by the Treasury Bureau of Stat
istics. The summary given out shows that the im
ports from the island in that time amount to $3,316.
334. against $1,169,128 in the corresponding months of
1897, or practically three times as much in the five
months of 1900 as in the corresponding five months
of 1807. The exports to the island in the five months
of 1900 are $2,807,909, against $717,744 in the corre
sponding months of 1806, arfd $768,802 in the corre
sponding months of 1897, or practically four times as
much in 1000 as in 1896 or 1897.
PERSONS who take the trouble to recall the
early days of the campaign will remember that
one of the points of the Bryanite attack upon
the administration is the Porto Rican tariff. That
phase of the fight was abandoned early, but it is still
sufficiently interesting to make it worth while noting
that the operation of that tariff has been beneficial to
trade, and that the act, within the extent of its scope,
has been as successful as any other 'measure enacted
by the present Congress.

a strong backing had Tupper won in Canada, for he
would have been able to say that British goods would
have no preferential tariff rates in that country unless
equal advantages were given to Canadian goods in
Biitain. As it is he will not, it seems, have much en
couragement froth the colonies in making the fight
the Tory imperialists desire him to undertake. In tint
respect the Canadian elections will not be without
effect upon the whole scheme of British imperialism,
and the British protectionists may have to wait before
bringing their scheme forward as an issue of practical
politics.
These things are said, not to foster a false pride or
sense of bumptious self-sufficiency, but to deny the
right of an American university president to demote
us to a position in which we do not rightfully belong.
We are not part of the Greater British empire. We
are greater than it all. If we chose we could crush
it like an eggshell. If other parts of the world seek
honor by adopting the title, "the Greater United
States." let it be so, according to their fancy. But
even then the title will be misapplied, for where is
the aggregation of nations, with a common speech
and genius, that can truly boast itself greater than this
country?
We are not copyists and imitators. We are origin
ators. Our operative methods, in all branches of pro
duction, are of our o\Vh devising. All that goes into
operative economies in our methods of transporta
tion is original with us.
The colonies had already grown out of semblance
to Great Britain. They had been planted a century
and a half before the Revolution. The prepotency of
a great ancestry, that knew not of the British Isles,
was in them. After their separation the differentiating
from English models progressed more rapidly. To
day it is complete.
President Wheeler of the University of California,
in a recent address, adopted the ideas of Sir Charles
Dilkc and put the United States, Canada, India and
Egypt together as parts of the empire of/ Greater
Britain. The classification is not only offensive, it is
untrue. It ensmalls us. . It detracts from our place in
history. We owe nothing to England, even in our
political institutions. They are not copied from hers.
They are derived from the same source as hers, and
that source is not within the British Isles. She took
the ancient Saxon model and made the best adapta
tion she could. We took the same model and adapted
it to conditions more favorable than England enjoyed
?nd have developed a system more favorable to th*
making of men of strong character and independent
individnality. Not many Americans will join Presi
dent Wheeler in saying that "it was probably better
that we separated from Great Britain."
Time and history have evaporated all probability
out of that separation.
To say that this feeling of independence has since
declined is to misrepresent the facts. We feel that we
are not the siphon for other energy than our own, nor
ir any pense a messenger for anybody. Our literature,
industries, art, science and activity are peculiarly of
domestic development. To derive them from Eng
land is not logical. They are the product of mental
energies and racial characteristics that were old when
the British Isles were peopled by half-naked savages.
The racial genius that has produced what is exhibited
to the world in the United States goes far back to a
potent ancestry in the north, to a race that was a sur
vival of the fittest when the curtain raised upon the
stage where it played its part and gave it to history.
What has been done in the British Isles by that genius
is the expression of its development in that environ
ment. The far greater work it has wrought in the
United States is the expression of what that potent
character could do under this environment. The two
expressions partake of their environment, and are in
dependent.
In the time of its publication there were protests
against the conception of the United States as a Brit
ish megaphone, through which the world was ad
dressed in behalf of English institutions. Even then,
emaciated by political diseases and not wholly con
valescent from the exhaustion of the Civil War. the
United States felt the independence of its position in
the world and its ability to cope with any nation or
group of nations upon any field, martial, industrial or
intellectual.
IR CHARLES DILKE published his "Greater
>^ Britain" in 1869. In its preface he said: "In
4 â America the peoples of the world are being
fused together, but they are run into an English
mold; Alfred's laws and Chaucer's tongue are theirs,
whether they would or no. There are men who say
that Britain in her age will claim the glory of having
planted greater Englands across the seas. They fail
to perceive that she has done more than found planta
tions of her own â that she has imposed her institu
tions upon the offshoots of Germany, of Ireland, of
Scandinavia and of Spain. Through America Eng
land is speaking to the world. Sketches of Saxondom
may be of interest even upon humbler grounds; the
development of the England of Elizabeth is to be
found, not in the Britain of Victoria, but in half of the
habitable globe. If two small islands are by courtesy
styled great, America, Australia, India/ must form a
Greater Britain."

originality; he lacked utterly his kind

or nil him with caustic poison like Swift's,

like Steele, Addison attacked not Individ

the name of a kindly humorist; but not

Beneath every humorous sketch by Steele

human sympathy: strip the polite veneer
from Addison and there appear only In
sinuation and malevolence.
HUmOR Of ENGLISH AND AMERICAN LITERATURE
For a century after Shakespeare the In
fluence of classicism with its rigid stand
ards, its cold criticism, its Intelligent bril
liancy, froze the genial current of English
literature. In all the century, with its
numbers of great writers, there was no
real humorist until Richard Steele, the
warm-hearted Irish captain of the Guard,
began in the Tatler that delightful dally
commentary on the manners, the vani
ties, the absurdities of the life that he
saw about him. Swift and Pope lived In
the same atmosphere and observed the
same weaknesses, but what a world of
difference between their satire and
Steele's!
Pope was satisfied with nothing but an
epigram as flittering a3 a stiletto and rs
keen; Swift fought with oil of vitriol, his
â¢wounds were never healed, never for
given; Steele had a heart as well as an
Intellect, he never forgot that his neigh
bor, with all his little vanities and weak
nesses, was, after all. a poor fellow-human
creature. It Is Impossible to read the
Tatler (1709-1711) an hour and not love Its
author. Wayward he was and improvi
dent; not always wife with the wine. It
may be; but he was a loyal friend and
companion who emptied his pockets at a

VANCOUVER. B. C. Nov. 9.â The
Oriental quarter of the fishing town of
Steveston is in an uproar over the pres
ence of a Chinese leper, who cannot be
located by the authorities. Ah Ling es
caped five days ago from Darcy Island,
the Canadian station on the Pacific
Coast. He got away in an open boat and
in a day and a night succeeded In pad
dling the forty miles from the Island to
Steveston. He was there for more than
a day before the authorities learned of his
presence. The Chinese are doing every
thing possible to protect the leper, and al
though the police have been working night
and day, they cannot find him. If he gets
away from Steveston there is little hope
of ever apprehending him.
Ah Ling was taken to Darcy Island two
years ago from Vancouver. , He was not
seriously aflilcted and it is said the dis
ease can hardly be detected on him. There
are five other lepers at the station, two of
whom are In. the last stages of the

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 9.-Emlle P. Mayer,
the young merchant who has been
charged with embezzling funds while a
clerk with the I. \V. Spring Company,
presented a sensational affidavit in Jus
tice Oneal's court this morning, when
ho asked for a change of venue on the
ground of prejudice of the Justice. A few
weeks ago Mayer was convicted on an
other charge and Oneal sentenced him to
pay a fine of 1250 and serve sixty days in
jail. The second charge is one In which
Mayer is alleged to have converted to
his own use â¢ $18 he received from Jose
Juarez for a suit of clothing he sold
while clerking for the Spring Company.
Since he left the Spring Company Mayer
and a brother have been conducting a
clothing store on Santa Clara street.
In his affidavit for a change of venue
Mayer swears that on election day he
met Justice Oneal, who was elected
State Senator in the Thlrty-flrst District,
at the eleventh precinct polling place.
He says Oneal approached nlm and said:
"I understand the Ortegas and the
Mayers are out against me. What is the
matter â didn't you like It because I con
victed you?"
To this the afflant replied: "What we
don't like about it is not the judgment,
but you holding me in 51000 bail."
The Justice is alleged to have then said
to. affiant: "Let me see. I ga.ve you 5250
and sixty days. I am sorry I didn't dve
you J300."
When the affidavit was read in court to
day Justice Oneal's face became ashen
and after a few preliminary remarks he
adjourned court for an hour to allow the
prosecution to present affidavits con
tradicting .he statement. On reconven
ing an affidavit by Elmer E. Cottle
deputy City Treasurer, was presented It
denied the statements made by Mayer
and de^ared Oneal in the presence ot
deponent, had said:
"I suppose you are sorry I didn't fine you
$500, so you could have an excuse for fight
ing me harder."
After the reading of the affidavit Justice
Oneal granted the change of venue on
statutory grounds to Justice Rosenthal's
court.
Mayer, when accused by the Sprinc
Company of taking funds not belonging to
him. acknowledged, he had taken a few
dollars and turned over JSOO worth of
building and loan stock to cover any
shortage. Later he brought suit to re
cover the stock, alleging he had been
coerced Into signing it over. He admitted
that he owed the Spring Company $14. He
also has a suit pending -in the Superior
Court to compel Justice Oneal to sign
papers on appeal in the sujt in which he
was convicted.

two men by observing the part taken by
each in the characterization of Sir Roger
de Coverley. that most charming creation
in all the periodical era. Both Steele and
Addison contributed studies for this typ
ical English gentleman, but It was SteÂ»le>
who added the little touches that make
him a living creation. Everything about
Sir Roger that is lovable was added by
Steel**, in Addition's papers he Is a simple
rural autocrat, good-natured yet ignorant,
affected, conceited. In Steele's/ papers he
Is a jolly, whole-hearted, thoroughly lov
able man, whose sayings and doings are
humorous in the widest sense- of the word.
Dick Steele was the humorist of the
early eighteenth century, even as Pope
was its epigrammatist and Swift its
satirist. Addison was to the prose of the
century what Pope was to the poetry. His
wit Is brilliant, his satire Is graceful and
amusing, but he Is not a great humorist,
for he had no heart.
No one has better expressed the situa
tion than Thackeray:
If Steele Is not our friend he in nothtnr. He
Is by no means the most brilliant of wits. ;i.;r
the deepest of thinkers: "but he is cur friend:
we love him as children love their lovÂ« with
an A, because he id amiable. Who likes a
man best because he is the cleverest or the
wlÂ«Â«t of mankind; or a woman becau** Â»he
is the most virtuous, or talks Frct.ch or r'ays
the piano better than the rest of her sex? I
own to liking Dick Steele the man and Plr!c
Steele the author much better than mnch bet
ter men and much better author*.
DICK STEELE. THE IMPROVI
DENT AND GOOD-HEARTED
"TATLER."
- It Is customary among literary his
torians ' to treat the founders of the
eighteenth century essay as a kirtd of
constellation revolving about its great
center, Joseph Addison. Steele, notwith
standing that he originated the periodical
essay and wrote the greater part of the
Tatler and nearly half the Spectator, Is
often lost Bight of in the effulgence that
surrounds the central figure. There Is no
question that "in point of literary skill
any one of Addlson's papers is worth all
Steele's put together." but mere technique
Is not all there Is In literature. Pope la
not superior to Shakespeare.
Addison was as witty as Steele, perhaps
more so: he was a craftsman of exquisite
skill: he was restrained and accurate
elegant and critical. One cannot help
picturing- him as a man flawlessly dressed
with the daintiest of gloves and ties, al
ways anxious about the proprieties: never
caught off his guard or beneath his dig- ,
Our club meets precisely at six o'clock in thÂ»
evening; but I did not come last night until
half an hour after seven, by which means I es
caped the battle of Naseby, which the major
usually begins at about three-quarter* after
s'x. I found also that my good friend the
boncher had already spent three of his distlchs
and only wanted an opportunity to hear a ser
r.ion spoken of that he might Introduce the
eouplet where "a stick" rhymes to "ecclesias

the same he had heard every night for these
twenty years, and upon all occasions winked
upon his nephew to mind what passed.
Or, again, take this exquisite picture of
the extremes of feminine vanity:
Miss Margery Beckerstaft*. my great aunt,
had Â£1000 to her portion, which our family was
desirous of keeping among themselves, and
therefore used all possible means to turn off
her thoughts from marriage. The method they
took. was. In any time of danger, to throw a
new gown or petticoat In her way. When she
was about 25 years of age she fell In love with
a man of an agreeable temper and equal for
tune, and would certainly have married him
had not my grandfather. Sir Jacob, dressed her
up in a suit of flowered satin, upon which she
set so Immoderate a value upon herself that
the lover was condemned and discarded. In
the fortieth year of her age she was asula
smitten, but very luckily transferred her pas
sion to a tippet, which was presented to her
by another relation who was in the plot. This,
with a white sarcenet hood, kept her safe in
the family until 50. About SO. which generally
produces a kind of latter spring in amorous
constitutions, my Aunt Margery had again a
colt's tooth In her head, and would certainly
have eloped from the mansion house had not
her brother Simon, who was a wise man and
a scholar, advised to dress her In cherry-col
ored ribbands, which was the only expedient
that could have been found out by the wit of
man to preserve the Â£1000 In our family, part
of which I enjoy at this time.
Honest old Dick Reptile Is the third of our

who speaks little himself, but laughs at our
jokes, and brings his young nephew along with
him. a youth of eighteen years old. to show
him pood company and give him a taste of the
world. This young fellow sits generally tllent;
but whenever he opens his mouth or laughs at
anything that passes, he Is constantly told by
his uncle, after a Jocular manner. "Ay. ay.
Jack, you young men think us fools; but we
old men know you are." The greatest wit of
our company, next to myself. Is a bencher of

The whole quaint age of Queen Anne

drollery, wit, pathosâ humor in Its largest
sense. It Is impossible to sample ade
quately this inexhaustible living foun
tain â one must dip Into it deeply; but let
us take a fragment from the description
of the Trumpet Club:
Ills physician and his wife were in close
whisper near his bedside. I overheard the doc

possibly live till five in the morning." She
received it like the mistress of a family, pre

in a servant, who said. "Madam, the unrter
tEker is below according to your order." The
words were scarce out of her mouth when thÂ«
sick man cried out with a feeble voice. "Pray,
doctor, how went bank stock to-day at
'change?"
With Steele "good nature was." as he
himself expressed it, "an essential quality
In a satirist." He aimed his shaft, not at
persons, but at baseness and folly. We
condemn the vice, we laugh at the lu
dicrous situation, but we pity the victim.
Sometimes we smile when we feel more
like crying.

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 9.â To Los
Angeles fell the honor of the
first performance of Maurice
Grau's colossal enterprise which
is to carry across the continent
and return a company of 2.V) people, in
cluding the most noted wizards of song in
the world. A guarantee of the snug little
sum of $16,000 had to be provided before
Mr. Grau would let his song birds loose
in the land of sunshine, but from present
Indications the guarantors will not suffer
as the result of the speculation.
Hazards Pavilion is a gaunt and grim
building, the smoky battle ground of polit
ical conventions, while its walls have
echoed the spellbinding periods of many
famous orators; but It Is not used to such
matchless music as flowed from its stage
last night. The local manager, Len
Behyner, had, it is true, accomplished
wonders with the poor material at his
command, and had considerably improved
the acoustic properties of the barn, but
on the flat floor mo6t of the people could
barely see the conductor, always one of
the most interesting features of opera,
and, worst of all, they could not see one
another.
Mrs. Flgueroa Street could not size up
the glory and the price of Mrs. Park
Place's toilet and Miss Marlborough
could not realize how unbecoming was
Miss Pasadena's coiffure. Nevertheless,
tho ladies did not neglect the opportunity
of displaying their beat and newest frocks
and to the gods above the scene below
was as brilliant as a Melba night
should be.
This is Melba's third visit to California
In three years, and although each year
emphasizes the relentless truth that she
has passed the heydey of her youth, and
that her waist is not so slim as in the
days of the Duke of Orleans' worship at
her shrine, yet her voice is as superb
and her art as Incomparable as of yore.
The diva has no opportunity in "La" Bo

Madame Gadski says she is in much bet

Herr Tauscher, and their little girl. Gad

Saleza paid the Grand Opera-house a
visit late yesterday afternoon and after
striking a few notes he was enthusiastic
over the acoustic qualities of the house.
Saleza is yet a young "man. of dis
tinguished appearance. He was born in
the south of France and studied In the
Conservatory of Paris; He took first prize
when he graduated and was entitled to
sing in the Grand Opera-house of Paris,
but he was only 20 years of age and he
decided to appear for a short time at the
Opera Comlqun. where he made a tre
mendous hit. He soon afterward sang at
the Grand Opera-house of Paris, where
he was retained as the leading tenor.
Two years ago he appeared at Covent
Garden. London, and the music lovers of
the great metropolis went wild over him.

fully designed double duet, the artists be

Melba; however, would not gratify the
desire for an encore as she had to* save
her voice for the mad scene from "Lucia,"
which was given as a bonus after the
conclusion of "La iloheme."
] If any evidence were needed that Melba
is still in her prime, her marvelous sing
ing of the great "Lucia" aria must have
proven convincing. She has sung it here
before, but never with more splendid ef
fect. Her listeners could not contain
themselves and broke forth with applause
that lasted several seconds as she flnA
lshed the coloratura with the flute ac
companiment.
apotheosis that Trilby reached.
But never has Melba been heard to
greater advantage, for she Is enamored of
"Lit Boheme." in which she also has a
financial Interest, having purchased the
riphts of production in the L'nited States,
and the queen of pong so throws her soui
into the Impersonation of Mimi that her
critics can no longer complain of her cold
ness or lack of sympathy.
Both Melba and Grau declare that ths
cast to-night if the most perfect that has
ever adorned "La Boheme ' since the score
left Puccini's hands.
Cremonini will be pronounced the best
tenor heard for many a long year on thu
coast, incomparably atronper than Bon
nard. who came with Melba on her last
visit. Cremonini was to-nlRht's Rudolfo
and fairly divided the honors of the pro
duction with the prlma donna. The mezzo
soprano. Miss Fritzi Scheff, made her
American debut to-night and added to the
laurels she has already won in Pans and
Berlin. The sprightly role of Musetta \a
well suited to her talents; she is pretty,
chic and a much cleverer actress than is
usually made in Germany.
Campanarl is here again with his bell
like tones that have made him probably
the best barytone in the world. He sang
the role of Marcello perfectly. The basso
is Journet and he did not miss his op
portunity to distinguish himself in his one
chance, his apostrophe to his treasured
overcoat which, it will be recalled, he
sacrificed to buy medicine for the dying
Mini. Cilllibert. a rich and unctuous bar
ytone, with plenty of big; humor â he is a
giant â on 1 the side, was the fourth of the
impoverished lovelorn students. Dufrlche
completed the list of principals, being as
signed the double role of Musetta's super
annuated lover and the landlord of Ru
dolfo's quarters.
Mancinelll wielded the baton over the
splendid orchestra of half a hundred
pieces. Puccini's orchestration is as sub
tle as it Is superb, and it is impossible
to imagine that greater justice could be
done to the score.
The audience, which numbered 2600 souls,
was calmly critical at first. "La Boheme"
was sung- here for the first time in the
United States three years a.so by the Del
Conte Company, and the opera has been
a favorite with local music lovers ever
since, but enthusiasm was displayed after
the climax of the third act. the" wonder-

Island, in past years densely populated
with Alaskan natives, contained only
seventy-throe souls. And Atka. the larg

population of but 173. This island, hall
a century apo supported a great tribe.
During* the'paet season measles and

DESIGN APPROVED BY THK
BATTLE OF MANILA MON- .
U1IEXT COMMITTEE.
THE Battle of Manila Monument
committee has given its approval
to the design submitted by
George T. Brewster, the New
York sculptor. Certain modifica
tions will be suggested and the sculptor
will; be required to submit a model. If
the | result is satisfactory the formal
award to Brewster will be made.
The decision was reached at a meeting
of the committee at the Hopkins Institute
of Art yesterday, afternoon, at which
there were present Mayor James D.
Phelan, Captain R. H. Fletcher, TV. G.
Stafford, Vanderlyn Stow, F. "W. Van
Sicklen and Charles Hirsch. The Brew
ster design had been, favored at former
meetings and the decision reached was
practically only a confirmation of the
earlier verdict.
The design thus provisionally accepted
Is a classic column, surmounted by a
winged figure, somewhat like that of the
Native Sons' monument by Douglas Til
den. It is conventional and while little
originality is shown by the sculptor, the
shaft will bo one of classic beauty.
The committee decided that seventy-six
feet, the proposed height, was not enough,
and the sculptor will be asked to Increase
the height. The committee also is anx
ious that the material used be California
granite. Another change suggested is
that , bronze tablets, commemorative ot
Dewey's victory, be placed on the faces of
the base.
Associated with the sculptor is the firm
of Brite & Bacon, architects, of New
York.
Twelve sculptors submitted designs,
among them being F. Peano of Oakland,
and Douglas Tilden, R. I. Aitken, Ru
pert Schmid, and Rupert Schmid and M.
P. Xeilson in collaboration.
The fund available for the monument is
$35,000. It was ] orginally meant for a
Dewey monument or arch, but later it
was decided to make it commemorative of
the great naval victory Instead of the
man. The fund was started by a $10,003
subscription by Claus Spreckels and
others subscribed $25,000 additional. The
monument will probably be erected In
Union Square.
The Battle of Manila Monument fund
should not be confused with the Soldiers'
and Sailors' Monument fund, which con
sists of the surplus of $25,000 from the
money raised for the reception of the
California volunteers.

The boy. who is but 9 years old, was

plank tipped under his weight and he fell
into the water.
The boy's playmates shouted for help,
and Pallas, who was near by, hurried to
the rescue. Stopping only to throw, off
his coat and hat. he let himself down
through the hole in the wharf where the
accident had occurred. As he struck the
water he saw the boy, some distance
awav. going down for the last time.
Pallas immediately dived and with des
perate persistence stayed at the bottom
until he found the boy, face downward,
in the soft mud. He brought him to the
surface and swam with him from beneath
the wharf. Bystanders helped him out
of the water with his burden.
The young lije-saver did not stop to
look after his own comfort, but at once

The packers claim they have been sell
ing dressed meats at a loss for several
years. In six months the price of meat
stuffs has gone up $2 50 per 100 pounds.
There has been no corresponding advance
in the price of cattle, hogs and sheep
Representatives of the packers in charge
of the dressed meat department say the
advance was justified by the condition of
the trade and its imposition on the heels
of the election is but a coincidence.
Retailers of meats were thrown into a
panic by the unexpected rise In prices.
Many who had carcasses In their coolers
declined to buy until they could llgure
out what they would need at the nÂ«w
rate. In the adjustment or prices to the
consumers choice cuts of beef have gone
up as much as 5 cents. Pork tenderloin
Jumped to the same extent, and mutton
chops went up3 cents. The advance by the
packers Is more than 10 per cent on the
price of meat the day before election. The
advance by the retailer to the consumer
will average 23 per cent, for the waste in
a carcass doubles the Increased cost of

Tha Philippine situation was discussed
at the Cabinet meeting to-day, but no new
instructions far as can be learned were
cabled to General - MacArthur, the policy
of mobilizing the troops instead of leav
ing small detachments out of reach of
each other to be slaughtered receiving
general approval. In army circles tho
suggestion is made that it might be ad
vantageous to offer a reward for' the ap
prehension of Aguinaldo. Whether this
would be a politic move or not would have
to be considered, but army officers are
convinced that his capture would have an
important effect in bringing about an end
to the insurrection. Aguinaldo would, if
alive, be a white elephant upon the hands
of the administration, and while the au
thorities do hot wish his death, it Is con
ceeded that if he could be killed during
the forthcoming operations the situation
In the islands would be materially sim
plified. - .
CALL BUREAU, WELLINGTON' HO
TEL, WASHINGTON, Nov. 9.â Major
General MacArthur will personally direct
the vigorous military operations to be di
lectcd against the Filipino insurgents, and
Major General J. O. Bates will probably
be assigned to duty in Manila ns executive
head or the military government in the
Philippines during the absence in the field
of General MacArthur. It is not proposed
by either the President or General Mac-.
Arthur that there shall be 'any repetition
of the policy of General Otis in the mat
ter of the commanding general remaining
In Manila Instead of taking ihe field. It
has frequently been stated that it would
have been wiser for General Otis to have
left to subordinates consideration of ex
ecutive details and have personally di
rected operations ot his troops. Such ac
tion, it is stated, would have benefited
the morale of the Americans and would
have had correspondingly bad effect upon
the enemy. General Otis, however, pre
ferred to remain in his office. General
MacArthur is a better fighting man than
an executive, and he has cleany indicated
that as> soon as the rainy season has ended
nÂ« would take" personal conirnana or the
troops. Tins action hus received the em
phatic approval of the President, and es
pecially m view of the expectation that
ueneral bates, who is a splendid execu
tive oilicer, will probably take General
AlacArthur's place in Manila. As stated
this morning, there has Deen talk ot or
dering General Chaffee to Manila, and it
was stated to-day that General Chatfee
might be ordered to that point to act aa
head or the military government while
General MacArthur was in the field.
General ChaKce, like General MacAr
thur, is a better soldier than an executive,
and when he reaches the Philippines he
is expected to take an active Command In
order to ilnally and completely crush the
rebellion. Pltns of the War Department
communicated to General MacArthur lor
suppressing the rebellion contemplate the
dividing up of Luzon into districts and tho
mobilization of sufficient troops in those
districts to effectually shatter any insur
gent forces that may be operating therein,
it is to bo expected that the Insurgents,
now that the dry season is at hand, will
disintegrate and that when General Mac-
Arthur moves he will tlnd only smaJl
bands, which will harass small parties
\r Â« may k* 5 sent out as scouts. General
aiacArthur is apparently confident, how
ever, that he will be able to tlnd large
bodies of Insurgents and is laying his
plans to catch them between crossfires.
pÂ«tails of operations must necessarily bÂ«
it 11 . to tJenoral MacArthur, but the au
thorities, as hitherto stated, have clearly
Indicated that the campaign must be a
vigorous one and that the Insurrection
must be crushed during the dry %eason,
now at hand.
His Generalship Is Expected
to Demoralize the In

Supervisors' Health. Committee Di

At a meeting of the Supervisors' Health
and Hospital Committee yesterday Braun
hart presented a resolution, which was
recommended for passage, directing tho
Board of Health to advise the Board of
Supervisors of the proper limits within
which carpet-beating works should not oe
maintained. Braunhart characterized the
machines used to beat carpets as being
deleterious to health and urged their im
mediate restriction.
A communication was received by the
committee In which attention Is called to
the fact that J. McQueen has commenced
operations with a carpet-beating machine
on Albion avenue, between Fifteenth and
Sixteenth streets, contrary to the orders
of the committee. The committee was re
quested to declare the machine to be a
nuisance and cause It to be abated. The
protest was referred to the Board of
Health for examination and report as to
whether or not the machine Is a nuisance.
Connor's ordinance prohibiting the adul
teration of food was Indefinitely post
poned, on the ground that the act of the
Legislature of 1S95 covers the point.

Professor Charles Mills Gayley delivered

The report of Kate E. Whitaker. super

Director Klncald. It Is as follows:
Number of pupils enrolled In cookery
classes \ 2^>
Number of individual lessons S^T.v)
Less by numbÂ«r of absences Jig
Many Pupils Study Cooking.
PreÂ«ident Mark of the School Board
stated that the opinion of the City Attor
ney that repairs to schoolhouses should
be done by the Board of Public Works
had guided the School Board in trans
ferring; the power. Director Denman said
that repairs had come to a standstill and
the health of the pupils was being jeop
ardized. Brandenstein suggested a test
< - ase, to be speedily determined, Jn the
meantime allowing the Board of Public
Works to make the repairs, with the ap
proval of the Board of Education, while
the case was on trial. He then Introduced
a resolution providing that Mr. ..Webster
be directed to notify the Board of Super
vlcors if he will audit a demand for work
performed in repairs to school buildings
If the Board of Education and of Public
Works acting Jointly cause eaid work to
be done.
D'Ancona arprued that the Board of Su
pervisors had no Jurisdiction in the mat
ter, as It could not compel Webster to
affix his signature to the demands. D'An
cona said it was a matter for the courts
to dMde. Chairman Boxton suggested
the transfer of the $20,000 appropriated In
the tax budget for repairs from the school
fund to the Board of Works, but it de
veloped that the signature of the Super
intendent would be necessary on the de
mands even in that case.
The responsibility for tho repairs of
pehoolhouses occupied the attention of
the Supervisors' Committee on Education
yesterday. Superintendent Webster ad
dressed the committee and contended
that the repairs should be assumed by
the Board of Education, -as the money for
the payment of such repairs comes out
nf the school fund. Webster denied that
the Board of Public Works, to which the
control of repairs had been transferred
by the Board of Education, had any legal
right to exercise the privilege, even
though the charter so proviued. He held
that the provisions could be proven to be
unconstitutional. Unless the Board . of
Public Works should pay for the repairs
out of its funds Webster said that he
would refuse to sisn the demands for re
pairs or for laborers in the repair depart
ment. He read a lonjr legal opinion of his
attorney which supports him In his con
tention.
Repairs to Schoolhouses.
The controversy that has existed be
tween the Board of Kducation and the
City Board of Examination over the- re
nrwal of the certificate of Miss Katharine
Ball, special teacher of drawing, Is a
thing of the past. Mils Ball has de
cided that ehe will take an examination,
and it was decided yesterday to hold a
special examination In the office of the
secretary of the Board of Examination on
the subject of drawing on November 17.
Miss Ball Yitls expressed her Intention, to
take the examination which ts open to all
applicants.
The Board of Examination fias all along
contended that while there was no ques
tion of Miss Ball's competency, her cre
dentials were inadequate and not recog
nized by the State Board of Education.
The Board of Education took a contrary
view, however, and issued a special cer
tillcate to Miss Ball on Its own account*
Rather than go to law to determine tho
dispute. Miss Ball will submit to the ex
amination as a matter of expediency.
The Board of Examination yesterday
made the following recommendations for
renewals of certificates:
Grammar Gradeâ Miss Hoslo Bcheler, Mrs.
Julius Wormeer.

COMES TO GRIEF
Little Irving Sprague Tries
to Beat. His Way to
Pacific Grove.
Without a cent In his pocket Irving
Sprague, an 11-year-old boy, yesterday
morning started to "beat" his way from
Sacramento to Pacific Grove, where his
mother and father are staying. After rid
ing on the brakebeam of a car as far as
Davisvillo he was discovered by a cattle
dealer, who was on his way to this city,
and who was riding on the same- train.
On learning that the little fellow was
penniless the cattle man took him Into the
car In which he was riding, and after pay
ing his fare ordered breakfast for him.
After reaching this city his benefactor
bought him a pair of trousers and then
turned him over to Captain of Detectives
Seymour.
When questioned the boy said: "Mamma
and papa went to Pacific Grove about a
week ago, leaving mo with my uncle, who
lives on Third street in Sacramento. I
became lonesome without them, and as I
did not have any money I determined to
beat my way to Pacific Grove. Secretly
leaving tho home of my uncle about 6
o'clock In tho mornlngr, I went to the de-
Fot and waited for a train to come alongr.
swung under the first one that appeared
and perched mysplf on a brakebeam. I
was glad when tho train reached Davis
ville, as every moment I expected to be
thrown under the wheels. On reaching 1
Davisville. I crawled from under the car
and was met by the gentleman who
brought me to this city. I wanted to Bee
my mamma, and that Is tha reason I left
my uncle."
Soon after tho boy was turned over to
Prison Matron Fabian a dispatch was
6ent to Pacific Grove inquiring about the
boy'n parents. Last evening an answer
was received, carrying the information
that they had left yesterday morning for
their home in Sacramento.
The uncle of the boy Is expected to ar
rive here to-day to take charge of the
youthful brakebeam tourist.

Enid Brandt's Last Recital.
. The last of the recitals by Enid Brandt,
the marvelous child pianist, will take
place this afternoon at Sherman-Clay
Hall, fcommenclng at S:15. The little mu
sician will play several ambitious numbers
by Handel, Moszkowskl, Henselt, Chamin
ade.. Chopin and Mendelssohn. r She Will
also play some of her own compositions.
Sin fully a hundred teachers of the first
prade were on hand. Some were In Ugh:
marching order with short walking fkirta
and Fedoras, while others were In their
accustomed attire. But no matter In
what grarb they appeared their faces all
wore an expression of "determination to go
through with the expected ordeal.
Calisthenics was the subject for yester
day afternoon and as a sort of limbering
up* process the teachers marched round
and round the yard clapping their hands
after the manner of the Salvation Army.
"Halt!" said Dr. Magnus, and the lino
fetched up all standing and the Instructor
continued:
"We will now proceed with the exerclso
of the arms. One! two! rlgrht! left!"
The young teachers giggled, but the
older ones took a grim interest In the
work and shot out their arms with great
energy'. â
"Of the leg we now 1-ave the exercises
was the next order. But a kind of frozen
look came over the line and when Dr.
Some small boys had wandered into tha
yard during the afternoon, but what they
saw boded ill for them and they left Im
mediately. When things get to workln*:
smoothly those teachers will turn out
grades of physical wonders that will dlsv
count Jeffries. At least that's what Dr.
Max Magnus says.
The lesson yesterday was the first of
the series of instructions In physical cul
ture which the- grammar grade teachers
of the School Department will receive at
the hands of Dr. Magnua.
"The limbs," he said, "the nether limbs;
you move them like me; so." It worked
like a charm and the exercises went
through after that without a hitch.
.
Magnus began to pirouette like a "pre
mier danseuse" his pupils all balked.
Some blushed. Dr. Magnus saw he had
made a mistake and plunged valiantly
into the breach.

Meantime it could be Ken wuat arrange

cases.
Attorney Cclllns objected. He saw no
reason why the cases should not be con-,
tinued until the decision in the appeal
rases was rendered, according to the
agreement between Mr. Coffey and him
te!f. "I would like one case to be set,"
continued Collins, ""as it would break the
stipulation and it would place my clients
in a better position, as we would have all
our rights."'
"1 want these cases to be tried right
away." said Byington. "I am not con
cerned about the stipulation, and if Col
lins wants to break it he can do so. I
have ro objection to the cases going over
until Monday. '
"I Â£m nit anxious to break the stipula
tion," retorted Collins, "but it seems to
me the other side is."
The Judge stopped further discussion by
continuing the cases until Monday and

Work on Model Camp Discontinued
Until Definite News Has Been Re
ceived From War Department,
The work of remodeling the camp at
the Presidio preparatory to receiving the
35,000 volunteers now in* the Philippines
has been discontinued, as It is not known
when the soldiers will return to this coun
try. To cover the frames now up with
canvas would mean an additional ex
pense in view of the coming wet season
and for this reason the quartermaster has
ordered that all work on the new camp
ceaso.
The troops garrisoning the post were
paid yesterday.
The departure of the Sheridan on the
16th inst. will take from the Presidio all
the recruits now In camp and all that re
port at the post previous to the sailing
date. Orders to this effect were issued
yesterday.
Eleven convalescents were made happy

After the business meeting O. V. I.angÂ»
of Berkeley gave a half-hour's talk on
"Flower Photography," using a numbei
of cleverly taken pictures prepared in his
own art gallery. The process of photo
graphing flowers is nearer the point of
perfection now than It has ever been be
iore. In the case of highly tinted flow
ers, the speaker said, it requires most
delicate shading on the part of the pho
tographer in order to bring out a faith
ful reproduction of the subject.
It was decided to hold a rose show next
May, and prfcpa ration."* for the' affair will
begin six mofaths prior to that date. Â¦ The
advisability of increasing the number of
vice presidents from one to two and the
board of directors from two to four was
discussed and the plan, will probably be
carried out. Â¦ .
The recent flower show held under the
auspices of the California State Floral So
ciety waa a big success financially, ac
cording to the report of the treasurer,
which was made at a meeting of the so
ciety held at Central Hall yesterday aft
ernoon. Besides paying all expenses there
is a substantial balance which was or
dered turned into the treasury for gen
eral use.

FLOWER SHOW PROVES
A FINANCIAL SUCCESS
Policeman Harry Hook was detailed to
investigate the matter. Ho reported at
the City Hall that neither Adams nor the
boy were to blame. Adams' account of
the accident coincides with the reports
made by other passengers on the car.
Young Rucldick is attached to the mes
senger office at Sutter and Leavenworth
streets and just before 7 o'clock last night
was returning to the office along Geary
street. He was riding a bicycle and was
coming down the slight grade, between
Polk and Larkin streets, as a car of the
Geary-street line came westward. He
was on the south track, riding the slot at
a rapid rate.
C. V. Adams, a passenger on the car,
employed by Hromada & Co., confection
ers, who lives at 925 Geary street, at
tempted to alight in front of his residence.
The boy or passenger did not see each
other, tor as Adams stepped oft the car
the bicycle struck him in the groin,
throwing the boy, Adams and the bicycle
in a confused heap on the pavement.
Adams quickly picked himself up, al
though considerably bruised, and went to
Ruddick*s assistance. The boy was ly
ing in the street, bleeding and uncon
scious. Adams picked him up in his arms
and carried him to the drug store at the
corner of Geary and Larkin street*,
whence he was sent to the Receiving Hos
pital.
Up to this time Adams did not feel his
injuries. He was assisted to his resi
dence, where he found it necessary to
summon medical assistance. He was
considerably bruised about the head and
body.
When Ruddick reached the hospital he
was unable to speak. To Dr. Dorr he
signified his ability to write and Â¦was able
to give his name and address before again
lapsing into unconsciousness. Dr. Dorr
made an examination of his wounds and
found that his skull was probably frac
tured, but deferred an operation until
satisfied as to the boy's ability to stand
It. At a late hour Dr. Dorr came to the
conclusion that it would be necessary to
trephine the skull in order to save the
boy'6 life.
Hovering between life and death,
George Ruddick, 11 years of age, living
at 2S Grove street, and employed as a
messenger boy by the American District
Telegraph Company, lies on a cot at the
Receiving Hospital with - what promises
to be a very serious fracture of the skull.
He is als6 suffering from a number of
minor contusions.
A Capital Operation Will Be Per
formed to Save the Life
of the Boy if Pos
sible.

When one stops to think about the good Mrs. Johnson derived" from Mrs.
Pinkham's advice and "medicine, it seems almost beyond .belief ; yet it Is all
true as stated in her three letters published above at her own request.
As a matter of positive fact Mrs. Pinkham has on file thousands of
letters from women who have been safely carried through that danger period
"Change of Life." Mrs. Johnson's cure is not an unusual one for Mrs. Pink-
ham's medicine to accomplish. a
" I send you this letter to publish for the benefit of others. I was sick for
about nine years so that I could not do my work. For three months I could
not sit up long enough to have my bed made. 'I had five different doctors, and
all said there was no help for me. My trouble was change of life. I suffered
with ulceration ol the womb, pain in sides, kidney and stomach trouble, back-
ache, headache, and dizziness. I am well and strong, and feel like a new
person'. My recovery is a perfect surprise to everybody that knew me. "I owe
all to Lydfa E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound. -I would not do without
your medicine for anything. There is no need of women suffering so much if
they would take your remedies, for they are a sure cure." â Mrs. Chaslotte
Johnson, Monclova, Ohio.
" I have been taking your remedies, and think they have helped me a great
deal. I had been in bed for ten weeks when I began taking your Vegetable
Compound, but after using it for a short time I was able to be up around the
house. The aching in the lower part of womb has left me. Tne most that
troubles me now is the flowing. That is not so bad, but still there is a little
every day. I am not discouraged yet, and shall continue -with your medicine,
for I believe it will cure me." â Mbs. Chablotte Joksso:*, Monclova.Ohio.
April 13, 1900.
" Dear Mrs. Pktkham : â I have been sick for a long time. I was token
sick with flooding. All my trouble seemed to be in the womb. I ache all the
time at the lower part of the womb. Tho doctor says the womb is covered
with ulcers. I suffer with a pain on the left side of my back over the kidney.
I am fifty years old and passing through the change of life. Please advise ma
what to do to get relief. Would like to hear from you as soon as possible." â

Owing 1 to modern methods of living, not one woman in & thousand apÂ»
proaches this perfectly natural change without experiencing a train oi very
annoying, and sometimes painful symptoms.
Those dreadful hot flashes, sending the blood surging to the heart until It
seems ready to burst, and the faint feeling that follows, sometimes with chills,
as if the heart were going to stop for good, are only a few of the symptoms of
a dangerous nervous trouble. The nerves are crying out for assistance. The
cry should be heeded in time. Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound was
prepared to meet the needs of woman's system at this trying period of her life.
The three following letters are guaranteed to be genuine and true, and
stiil further prove what a great medicine Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound is for women.

CHICAGO, Xov. 9.â Wheat formed a some
what Irregular market early, feeling the steady
Liverpool cables on the one hand and on the
other reports declaring damage claims for
Argentina had been exaggerated. December
opened unchanged to 73-%Â®73Uc, and shortly
afterward touched 73%Â®73iic. A drop to 73^ic
was followed by a recovery and the gain In
price was gradually Increased as the session
progressed. The falling off in receipts helped,
but the chief boost came from the shipping de
mand. Shorts covered freely the last hour
December advanced to 73*Â»'(?73T4c and closed
%tfi^c over yesterday at 73 : !4c.
Corn was fairly active. The market opened
easier on the favorable weather and liberal
Argentine shipments and later on the receipts,
small country offerings and on improved cash
demand and, in sympathy with wheat, rallied
In good shape. December closed Vi@%c up at
35%c.
Oats were quiet, but shared in the prosperity
of the other leading grain markets. December
closed V4c higher at 22c. Speculative business
In provisions was the smallest of any day this
month and the tendency of prices was down
ward. The market opened flrm on a lighter
run of hogs than had been expected, but turned
easy on a slack demand and liberal offerings
January pork cloÂ«ed 2i^ c lower, lard a shade
higher, ribs unchanged.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
There was considerable profit-taking, supple
mented by selling for London with fairly large
short offerings by traders. The reaction, how
ever, failed to appear, mainly because of the
large buying public, which promptly made its
appearance. Commission-houses were conspicu
ous purchasers, the conclusion being that the
election had brought the public back into the
market In full force. The offerings were read
ily absorbed and the recorded transactions at
the stock exchange on Wednesday rose to about
1.600.000 shares, though it ls believed that the
actual amount on that day was fully 2 000 000
sharer, making it the largest single day's
business In the history of the exchange, nos
ing firm on Wednesday, the next day developed
further activity and a large demand for stocks
despite the sitms that the enthusiasm was
wearing off. London was again a seller but
there were indications that the manipulation
Interests were active on the bullish side par
ticularly in stocks such as Brooklyn, Manhat
tan or Sugar, In which the bears were numer
ous. Large buying orders seemed to appear at
concessions', and the activity, though on a
smaller Bcale, was sufficiently strong to Indi
cate the continued pretence of the public The
Industrials were features and there appeared to"
be a feeling that the election was a fctronc
point in favor of such stocks and gave a basis
for discounting any expansion in the iron and
The market on this eide opened materially
higher than Monday's close, with a good deal
of excitement.
Speculation awaited the Presidential election
with confidence, despite nervousness In some
quarters and the hardening of money on the
eve of the decision. The stock exchange com
munity, moreover, has, since the election, cele
brated the triumph of 'sound money principles
and the expectation of the further business
prosperity by a strong and active market At
the end of last week there was a conservative
feeling, due to higher money and a disposition
to restrict speculative obligations, thoueh the
Indications were that large interests had Batls
fled themselves about the result and were elv
ing the market support. On last Saturday and
Monday the market was strong, owing larBÂ»lv
to the tendency of the shorts to cover. Several
houses with London connections made arrange
ments to send orders to that market on Tues
day night, and as the outcome of the election
was unmistakable the facilities were made use
of extensively. The New York buying In Lon
don in the early hours was estimated at 60 000
shares and caused a sharp advance In Ameri
can rails.

NEW YORK. Nov. 9.â To-day will prov* a
memorable one in the history of the Stock
Nrzi 1 York Stock Market.
Esrhar-gc, both t>y reason cf the amount ami '
the great variety of the business done. The !
apgregate number of shares of all stocks traded
in footed up no leÂ« than 1.544.000 shares or
listed S;^uf-5 and the nurr.br of different stocks
dealt in amounted to 177 issues. There were
nonÂ» of the enormous individual transaction*
vhich shewed in the excited trading and ex
tensive buying of Wednesday. Neither was
there the synchronous movement of the whole
market, which was so conspicuous on Wednes
day, including the brief period cf reaction after
the first upward rush of prices. To-day's mar- |
Jf - t en the contrary was exceedingly varied and !
irrfgu'.ar all day and the furious activity con- j
tinued without intermission or abatement from
the opening till thÂ» cli s;. The first transac

Different stocks and different groups of FtockJ
were successively brought forward into the au
vance and mmtMlftiy yielded to the pressure
cf profit-taking sales, while speculators rushed
to another group, trannferTlng their â¢ p-ofus
from one quarter of the market to be invested
in another. Nothing could be more character
istic of a genuine bull market in full snlng
and the fact that the rotation of the epecula
tRn brought around Into the railroad group
again before the deliver}' had elapsed, added
t<> the confident sentiment for the advance.
At the opening and during all the earlier pu^ t
of the day the railroad Mocks were distinctly

In hand. :
NEW YORK. Nov. 9.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
There was a distinct reduction in the. volume
of business transacted here to-day, partly due
to the obstruction of the Lord Mayor's show,
but due mainly to the approach of Monday's
settlement. Americans were not excited and
the activity In them was much reduced. They
were kej.t about steady by New York support
but London is etlll inclined to realize because
of the fact that the recent trading has been
larpely a professional gamble on the election
of Mr. McKlnley. The market In the street,
however, proved a surprise, a very large num
ber of brokers being gathered. There was
more noise than business, however. London
seemed to require some new development as an
incentive, the election Impulse having been ex
hausted here.

NEW YORK, Nov. 9.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
Tho Iron markets arc In an encouraging con
dition. No violent speculation ls threatened,
but in numerous Instances a better demand has
caused small advances. The most notable
change thus far ls In plglron, which ls eagerly
sought at all markets, large contracts being
placed at 25@'5Cc a ton above the bottom point
recently quoted. In partially manufactured
forms, such as plates and beams. Improvement
ls definite, while large building operations will
keep structural material moving freely. More
ships are planned and bridges recjuire material.
Railroads are buying most products freely. Or
ders for export are numerous and foreign ma
kers have been compelled to reduce prices for
steel rails. Spot cotton has not advanced as
expected on the approach of frost. Actual
damage has not come and belief In a current
yield of 10.000,000 bales is stronger. Russian
ports send out wheat freely and even In Argen
tina the outlook for the crop la less discour
aging. Western receipts are large. A heavy
cut in the price of refined sugar by all- the
large interests brings standard granulated to
5.60c. Speculation in hides ls .out of propor
tion to the boot and shoo trade. Prices at Chi
cago advanced for some months and leather
has only partially responded, while boots and
shoes average the same price a* two months
ago, when the bottom was reached. Shlpmcnt3
from Boston are slightly under recent weeks,
but there are sample orders eo long as goods
do not respond to more expensive raw material.
Tills statp of affairs cannot continue indefinite
ly. The hard winter weather ls making havoc
with the textile industries and almost counter
acts the election. Wool is more active at
noston than at any time this y*-ar. but specu
lation ls reappearing. Manufacturers buy in
moderation, but sales at thp three chief East
ern markets rwich.-d S.131,000 pounds. Prices
are steady and holders nre confident, although
heavy stocks are available.

on foreign grades from all sources make im
portations almost prohibitory, with no appar

or distant future. Great Britain ls as sum! "la
new position in the coal line; she ls now an
importer, not an exporter as she has a'ways

Large oil producers are keenly seeking buvers

10OAKLAND, Nov. 9.â Billy de Coursey of
Los Angeles, a veteran of a hundred bat
tles, was punched to a standstill to-night
by Tom Herman, a likely young feather
weight, who forced his older antagonist
to quit in eight rounds of as fast fighting
as any patron of the ring could wish to
witness.
The event was the main affair of the Re
liance Club's monthly boxing tournament.
The announcement declared a fifteen
round go for the featherweight champion
ship of the coast. Herman foucht from
the sound of the first gong, and he did
not ease up until the middle of the eighth
round found De Coursey practically out.
In fact he threw up his hands, labored
listlessly about the ring, and as his sec-
onds dragged him Into his corner, the
worn-out boxer sank unconscious into ths
canvas seat. De Coursey played a runa
way game, but Herman followed his man
about the ring. In the seventh round De
Coursey went to the floor repeatedly and
In the eighth was on the mat most of the
time. It wag a clean, hard, punching go
on Herman's part and he fairly won tho
event.
The first match of the evening was be
tween George Watson of the South End
Rowing Club and Dick Martin of San
Francisco. It was a handy ten rounds.
Watson getting the decision. The next
bout was between Charles Johnson and
Jack Dean at 135 pounds. The flght went
to the limit of ten rounds, but the deci
sion in Johnson's favor was far from sat
isfactory to the spectators.

MINE OWNER GILPIN
THIRSTS FOR BLOOD
OF JOKER MALOON
OAKLAND, Nov. 9.â City License
Inspector. Henry Maloon has spent
the entire day in the Piedmont hills
because of the wrath of City Treas
urer Z. T. Gilpin. Gllpin, ordinari
ly a mild mannered, kind hearted
gentleman, is stamping around
town with blood in his eye, all be
cause Maloon put up an innocent
little Joke on him.
Gilpin owns a mine and desiring
to divide his future prosperity with
pome of his friends he decided to
let a few in on the ground floor.
Everything is going well with the
property, and Mr. Gilpin arranged
a meeting of the stockholders, who
had been let in on the ground floor,
to be held at his house last night.
The first ore from the mine had
arrived In Oakland yesterday after
noon -and Mr. - Gilpin sent word
around to the stockholders that
there would be an exhibition of the
ore at his home in the evening.
Every one was requested to be
present.
Among the stockholders who had
been Vet in on the ground floor was
Henry Maloon. When Mr. Gilpin
received word that the ore had ar
rived he requested Mr. Maloon to
go to the express office and bring
the sack to the office. Maloon se
cured the sack, carefully deposited
it in the Police Office and ' then
went down and secured an exact
duplicate of the sack, filled it with
earth and cobblestones and de
livered it to Mr. Gilpin, who de
posited it in the city's vault until
the meeting of the stockholders
last evening/
The feelings of the stockholders
who had been let In on the ground
floor when they gazed upon that
"ore" can better be Imagined than
described, and Henry Maloon has
not dared to come in from the hills
to-day. It is hoped Mr. Maloon
may return without danger of vio
lence to-morrow.

SPEAKERS OF NOTE

Ernest H. Wagner, an employe of the
water company at Alvarado, and William
J. Dingee gave some testimony about* the
Alvarado system. The day clo3ed with
another fiat declaration by Mr. Hayn?
that the water company had refused to
obey Judge Hart's order to allow exami
nation of the company's records.
"We tried to see the records of the sur
vey cards in the offices." said Hayne to
McCutchen. "but after your clients had
shown us a few of them they stopped and
refused to let us go ahead. I only men
tion this because of the frequent procla
mations made In this court that one could
see the records that you have left."
There will be a session of court to
morrow, because Mr. Adams, one of the
water company's expert engineers. Is
anxlpus to return to Los Angeles, where
another water suit Is on trial.
"An ordinary corporation might not,
but a corporation that deliberately burns
its books would probably refuse to show
its records," declared Attorney Hayne.
But Judge Hart ruled that the state
ments should go in and City Clerk
Tompkins was directed to get the figures
on the construction account from the
statements In accordance with McCutch
en's demand.
"Do you think a corporation that was
resting its case upon its statement from
the books would refuse to show them?"
was the evasive question of McCutchen.
ridiculous one ever given by a man of af
fairs. I could conceive that old records
mlg^ht be destroyed, but I cannot under
stand nor see any valid reason why rec
ords of date to the very day of destruc
tion should be thrown Into the flames.
"President Watkinson's reason was a
fairy tale, which was received with ridi
cule throughout the State."
McCutchen insisted that if the city ac
cepted Watkinson's statement concerning
the destruction, it must accept his rea
sons. The attorney further replied that
the Information contained In the books
had been reported to the City Council an
nually. He asserted that If the City
Council had desired to see the books It
could have compelled the water company
to produce them.
"Show me any law on that point," In
sisted Judge Hayne.

Hayne Roasts the Water
Company Because of
Its Books.
OAKLAND, Nov. 9.â "As God is
my judge, I believe those books were
destroyed to prevent their being used
for the very purpose for which they
are now desired. I do not think that
there is a man in the State of Califor
nia who believes that those books
were destroyed for an innocent pur
pose."
Such was the sensational reply which
Robert Y. Hayne made to-day during the
water rate suit trial to the suggestion put
forth by A. A. Moore for the water com
pany that the corporation's records would
not have been burned if the company had
known a euit was to be brought.
That extraordinary act of destruction
was the text for a hot fight between the
opposing attorneys to-day. In fact, it was
the keynote of the day's struggle. Judge
Hayna made a strong effort to prevent
the Introduction in evidence of the numer
ous annual statements which the water
compar.y had from year to year filed with
the City Council. He based his opposition
upon the ground that the water company
had voluntarily put out of existence the
records from which those statements were
made. Under the circumstances of the
destruction of the books Judge Hayne de
clared that the corporation was not now
entitled to use secondary evidence when
by its own acts it had put beyond reach
the primary data.
Against all of this was the excuse^ of
fered by President Watkinson of the con
tra Costa Water Company, first, that the
books had been burned because the corn
i>anv bad no room for them, and second,
that Watkinson thought he would have
no more use for these vast records of a
ereat corporation's business because of
the annual statements filed with the Coun
Â° Judee Hart upon these arguments ad
mitted the annual statements in evidence,
asserting that thoy were admissible be
muse the Councilmen had them at their
command and had said they examined
lh The fight on the statements was height
ened by thÂ© frequent declarations by
Hayne that the- destruction of the records
was in his opinion, fraudulent in the eyes
of the law and the world, jj
The contest opened as poon as Mc-
Cutchcn had called City Clerk Tompkins
to the witness stand, that official navlng
taken to court the mass of statements.
Mcrutchen said ho desired to introduce
the record of construction account in the
sta'err-ents. Judge Hayne objected at
once "first because the statements fur
nished to preceding City Councils had
nothing to do with this case, and second,
that the books had been voluntarily de-
Etroved He insisted that secondary evi
dence under the circumstances, was not
allowable "Because the law presumes
that when the bpoks are destroyed they
are destroyed for a fraudulent purpose,
declared Judge Hayne. replying to a query
from Attorney McCutchen.

continued: "If any other rule than thisâ

instead of that this stock went to the
other side despite the fact that both
Beatie and Vinzent were in the direct
employ of William J. Dirge*.
Th*> fight came suddenly. When the ma
jority of the stockholders saw that the
assessment had been levied and that
there must he o fipht they prepared for
it. The stockholders' meeting that dis
missed one board of directors and elected
a new one was held yesterday morning,
only a few hours before the assessment
was to become delinquent. At this meet
ing about 325.000 shares of stock were rep
resented and tht action taken was out
lined in The Call this morning.
AiÂ» was quite natural, the old board of
directors resented being summarily dis
missed, and at the appointed time held a
meeting. Ignoring the one at which they
were dismissed, and' proceeded to pell out
the stock of the opposition, even though
it amounted to a clear majority of the
capital of the company.
Neither side is recognizing the meeting
of the other side, and the legality of the
two mertings is the point that will have
to be adjudicated.
Meanwhile not a little interest centers
about the severance of the close confi
dential relations that have always existed
between William J. Dingee and W. R.
Beatie and E. G. Vinzent. As much pub
lic attention has been attracted by this
severance of relations as by the fight to
control the companies. When Dingee se
cured control of the Contra Costa Water
Company he made Beatie, his confidential
man. secretary of the company, and gave
Vinzent an interest in his real estate busl
ne?s. It is paid that Beatie and Vinzent
each got their Interest in the Giant
and California-Standard Oil Companies
through Dingee. Dingee held 100,000
shares of this stock, secured from M. J.
Laymonce, thÂ» organizer of the company.
When the consolidation of the two water
companies took place Dingee. gave Bea
tie one-third of his holdings. Vinzent one
third and kept a third himself.
Two Boards of Directors Hold Meetings,
Legality of Which Is in Doubt
It is probable that when the assessment
Â¦was levi*<1 the majority of the board of
directors expected that the Reatie-Vln
rer.t stock and some of the other holdings
would vote with it to secure control, but
Laymance and Merrill each represent j

HIS Broadway, Nov. 9.
The Congregational clergymen and a
number of prominent laymen of that
faith have formed a committee to dis
cover measures for the relief of the Mar
ket-street Congregational Church, which
is In debt to the amount of $8700.
A council of ministers and laymen was
held last evening at the church to hear
the condition of affairs and to lnaugrurato
some steps toward relief. The facts of
the situation are that $5000 Is due by the
church to the Church Building Associa
tion of New York and $3700 to individuals.
There is an Item of $1000. money received
from the Pacific Theological Seminary,
the 6tatus of which is in doubt. The
church incurred a debt of $13,000 when its
new edifice was erected at Market and
Eighteenth streets six years ago.
The pastor's salary started at $1000 a
year; was increased to $2000 annually, but
under the load of debt the pressure be
came too severe.
Appeal was made to the Church Build
ing Society and arrangements were made
for a donation of $5000 and a ten-year loan
of $5000, provided the remaining $3000 was
paid by the church. The conditions were
accepted, but "the church had the debt as
sumed by Individuals. There has been a
considerable default in payments.
Mrs. Huggins loaned $2500, and aa the
debt did not diminish $1000 was procured
from the Pacific Theological Seminary.
The church is now without a permanent
pastor, Rev. W. H, Scudder only occupy
ing the pulpit as supply. ' The churcil
must have an income of $40 a week to ex
ist, and its average weekly receipts have
been only $25. The committee appointed
has chosen R. II. Chamberlain as chair
man. A report will be made as to the best
way to meet the difficulty.
Among those present at the conference
were: Rev. C. R. Brown. Rev. J. K. Mc-
Lean, Rev. W. H. Scudder, Rev. M. Mow
bray, Rev. Dr. Pond of San Francisco,
Rev. George Hatch, R. R. Chamberlain,

LJMON*. Colo., Nov. 9.â Louise Frost. 11
years old. daughter of a ranchman, wu
found last night in a patch of weeds about
half a mile from her home, unconscious
and bleeding from many wounds. She had
been stabbed, apparently with a dirk, no
less than fourteen times. She died at mid
night without having regained conscious
ness. The physician who attended her ex
pressed the opinion that the girl had been
grossly maltreated before receiving the
stab wounds. She was waylaid when driv
ing home from school, for her horse
reached the stable about dark with the
buggy empty. Posses are scouring the
country in .every direction and the mur
derer wlU probably be lynched if captured.
The Sheriff of Lincoln County came
from Hugo with a posse to aid the citi
zens of Limon in the search for the mur
derer. He offers a reward of $300 for tha
capture of the guilty person, dead or
alive, and the same amount for each it
more than one was implicated. It is bo
lleved the terrible crime was committed
by a tramp. Â¦

THE four-masted barkentlne Olym
pic had a close call yesterday. A
fire broke out In the room of the
cabin boy, but owlns to tha prompt
action of the fire brigade on the transport
wharf all danger was over when the regu
lar patrol arrived.
The Japanese cook was preparing a dish
for himself in the forecastle when the
lamp upset, and In a few moments every
thing was In a blaze. The Japanese at
once made his escape, but gave the alarm
as he ran. H. S. Scott, superlntedent of
the transport dock, and E. R. Patterson,
chief clerk, saw the flames and at once
made a rush to help. Scott rung in an
alarm and Patterson, seizing: a small
chemical engine, put It on a truck and
made for the burning vessel. Once at
Howard-street Wharf No. 3. it did not
take him long to get the chemical engine
aboard and then he and his assistants
Â¦went to work.
"When the city engines arrived on the
scene there was nothing for them to do.

V^y There is no wind and then again
' they do not know just where they
are, as the lightship is gone and they can
not secure their bearings.
Last night the French bark Lamorciere
was outside, while the British ship Glai>
cus from London was nearly ashore at
Bolinas. She stood in thinking it was>the
Golden Gate, but luckily Captain Bennett
discovered his mistake in time and stood
off shore again.
The French bark Marguerete Molinos
from Newcastle, England, and the British
ship Corunna from Newcastle, N. S. W.,
were also off shore last night, while the
British ship Hutton Hall From Antwerp
made port. There Is no wind and all of
the delayed fleet could have made port
had there only been tugs to bring them in.
Outside, keeping the deep-water fleet
company, were the schooners Volant,
Mary Buhne, J. M. "Weatherwax and

Scarcity of Tugs in

Annoying.
All Available Boats
Hard at Work on

THERE was a dearth of tugs in the
bay yesterday. All the available
boats of large dimensions were out
to the stranded steamer Olga,
while the emaller ones were kept busy as
>usy could be attending to the regular
business of the towboat companies. '
About noon time Uncle Sam wanted the
transport Sheridan moved from the dry
dock to the stream and a call was made
for tugs. The Spreckels people had not
a boat to spare and the Redstacks were In
the same box. ,
Finally the Santa Fe and the Pacific
Mail were applied to and the former
agreed to let Captain Barneson have the
use of the Richmond and the Mall Com
pany loaned the Millen Griffith. These
two tugs brought the Sherjdan down into
the stream and anchored her off the trans
port wharf, where she will be coaled anil
got ready for her next trip to Manila.

YOUNG GIRL DRINKS
ACID AND EXPIRES
No Reason Can Be Assigned for the
Suicide of Miss Adah
Purington.
Miss Adah Purington, the 18-year-old
daughter of Henry O. Purington, a wool
buyer, committed suicide by drinking car
bolic add at her home, 2627 Pine street,
last evening. No reason can be assigned
for the girl's sad act except the family's
determination to make their future resi
dence In Oregon, which change the girl
objected to.
Yesterday afternoon Mrs. Purington left
her home to make some purchases. When
6he returned she found her daughter alone
and unconscious on a bed. Not knowing
what was responsible for the girl's con
dition the crazed mother called a physi
cian. The doctor discovered an empty
carbolic acid bottle and a whisky glass
half full of the poisonous liquid near the
bed. He applied restoratives and used a
stomach pump, but his efforts failed and
in a. short time the young woman was
dead. After drinking the add Misa Pur
ington had with a handkerchief carefully
wiped what remained on her lips.
The father of the girl is at present In
Oregon. She has a sister. Miss Frances,
a nurse.

MOST of yesterday Attorney W.
H. Metson was under exami
nation before United States
Commissioner Heacock and
when court adjourned he had
still more to tell. Attorney Thomas J.
Geary conducted the cross-examination
and Attorney E. S. Pillsbury the direct
examination, and by both testimony that
will do no good to the ring In Nome was
brought out.
In the morning under Pillsbury's ques
tioning Metson told of some of the event3
of the miners' fight that were most sensa
tional, and for the first time since he has
returned from the gold fields he admitted
that his life was threatened while he was
battling for the rights of his clients In
defiance of the opposition of the authori
ties in Nome. In the meantime the case
of the miners is gaining in strength, and
as the testimony piles up It looks more
and more as If the crash when It does
come will be a record breaker.
As the case stands now, it appears from
the evidence "that the attorneys for Mc-
Kenzie advised him, after the second
writs (those of arrest) arrived in Nome,
that he had better deliver up the dust
to the mineowners. It has been shown
that t>oth Geary and Dubois, who acted
as McKenzie's counsel, told Metson that
they had so advised their client, and
when the McKenzie case comes ud Mc-
Kenzie must either admit that he acted
contrary to the advice of his counsel or
controvert their positive statements.
The morning session before Commis
sioner Heacock was devoted to the con
tinuation of the examination of Metson.
He told how, when the writs of arrest
had arrived and it had been decided to
break Into the vault where the dust was
stored, Geary came to him and told him
that McKenzie would . never give up the
dust without a fight, and that if there
was a fight there would be five or six
men killed: and If Metson was among
the killed It would be his own fault. He
was told that if he persisted in breaking
into the vault he would probably be killed,
and if he were not several others
would be and he would be responsible
for their deaths. Geary said to Metson
that he did not want him to get hurt
and he had better make a stipulation that
the dust should not be sent out of the
country, but should be placed under the
jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Ap
peals. Both Geary and Dubois then said
that they had advised McKenzie to give
up the dust, but It did not look as If he
was going to do so without a fight. Met
son declined to make any stipulation, but
he informed the attorneys that he was
going to -have that dust if he had to take
It himself.
It is a vital point in the case to show
that Dubois was acting for McKenzie.
and in support of the charge that he was,
Metson told how, in the proceedings, Du
bois first acted for the plaintiffs, Comtoi?
and Chipps, and later for McKenzie, the
receiver. This was objected to in open
court, and from that time Geary appeared
for the receiver, but he was often In con
sultation with Dubois and It was general
ly understood that Dubois was attorney
for McKenzie as well as for others.
Continuing Metson said that when the
first writs were served In Nome an at
tempt was made to have the District
Court in Nome enforce them by some or
der directed to the Marshal, but instead
Judge Noyes made an order showing that
he had no further jurisdiction in the mat
ter, the case having gone to the Circuit
Court of Appeals, and by this the defend
ants were shut out from any relief In his
court. It was thought that this would
end the litigation In the Alaska court, but
when the plaintiffs came in with an ap
plication for an order restraining the de
fendants from taking any of the gold they
dug from the mine out of the country, the
court seemed Inclined to grant It.
The defendants had by that time taken
possession of the claims and were work
ing them, so the object of the application
was obvious. In vain Metson pleaded and
argued before the court, and then he fin
ally produced the orders the court had
made that very morning.' The orders
were to the effect that the court had no
further jurisdiction In the case and Met-
Bon asked how. then could it take up the
application for an injunction or restrain
ing order made, by the jplaintiffs. â¢
"What did the court say to that?" asked
Pillsbury.
"Nothing," said Metson. "Judge Noyes
said nothing at all; he went on and grant
ed the restraining order the plaintiffs had
asked for."
Metson then went on to explain that
theso orders were not filed; they had
merely been slipped into the papers and
it was a question as. to what value they
held In law anyway. A.% any rate they
were sufficient to hold the defendants
back while the plaintiffs got ahead. -
Metson then took up the subject of the
keys of the vault that had been placed In
the hands of the District Attorney, Joseph
"Woods, and how he refused to â¢ deliver
them up. He retold also the story of how
the miners went to the bank and took
what the law said they might take. ;
Kenneth H. Jackson, who was on the
stand Thursday, was again called, this
time to show that he had induced Judge
Johnson, who preceded Judge Noyes on
the district bench of Alaska, to resign.
The Inference of the questions was that
Jackson had paid Johnson $25,000 not to
appoint a receiver in the cases against his
clients and to resign, but Jackson denied
that any such transaction was even
thought of. Johnson is his partner in
much of the litigation In which he is In
terested, and he declared that there was
no man who could charge Johnson with
anything unmanly or dishonest.
When Jackson had finished Clunle start
ed to cross-examine Metson. Metson ex
plained that when he was retained by
Js San Francisco a city or a city and
county? That is the question around
which are revolving a mass of le
gal learning, bundles of authorities, de
cisions, precedents and the fate of the
civil service principle in the charter. Gar
ret McEnerney and Joseph C. Campbell
argued opposing sides cf the problem be
fore Judge Hebbard yesterday and on
Monday John Garber will close the de
bate. Attorney McEr.trney, who was
pleading for the civil service clause, in
Fists that the county of Ean Francisco
died in 1S56 and that the county govern
ment act rot only does not operate on
this peninsula but never did. Attorney
Campbell is equally insistent that the
county government act of the State does
rule in San Francisco and that certain
of our officers hold iheir office and are
governed by State laws of tenure. ThcsÂ»
officers are those who perform State du
ties to the exclusion cf municipal obli
gations.
Both contentions were embellished yÂ«->s
terday with history, logic, abstruse and
emphatically unlntere-unfr legal lore and
migament. Judge Hebbard is called upon
to decide and upon him rests the decision
of tying the hands of the Civil Service
Commission or permitting it to perform
the duties provided for it in the chartei
until one or the other of the parties In the
controversy appeals to the Supreme Coun.
for a final judgment. The case is of ex
ceptional importance, as it broadone.1
greatly yesterday from Its original pro
portion?. John Garber declared that the
Civil Service Commission has not only no
right to dictate the appointment and qual
ification of county officers but it has no
power to act at all.
The argument was opened yesterday by
Joseph C. Campbell, who contended that
San FnBCisco is not only a city but also
a county with county officers, informing
a strictly State duty and governed by the
county government act. The charter of
Ean Francisco has no more authority to
decree that the County Clerk and his dep
uties must be restricted to men who ha\e
red .hair than it has to insist upon quali
fications in these officers which the coun
ty government act does not demand.
Mr. Campbell argued that the State Is
explicit^ln outlining what its county offi
cers shall be and what they shall do.
Fan Francisco has therefore a dual gov
ernment with two setc of officers. The
ofneers who are performing State duties
cannot consequently be subjected to the
civil service restrictions of the city of
San Francisco. These civil service rules
declare that employes of the municipality
shall have, .under certain conditions of
examination, acceptance and good be
havior, a life tenure of office. But the
State law decrees that none of Its offi
cers shall he chosen for a term longer
than four years.
It Is evident, therefore, said Mr. Camp
bell, that all of the government of San
Francisco which is In the nature of county
administration Is contiolled by State laws.
It is impossible to conceive how any ter
ritorial subdivision of California can over
ride State laws and dictate qualifications
of Sta:e officers which the State Itself
does not demand. During the argument of
Mr. Campbell there was developed a point
which will probably have great weight on
the decision of Judge Hebbard. City At-
On Monday morning John Garber will
argue in conclusion for the injunction
upon the Civil Service Commission. .
Further than this, the attorney said, a
court of equity does not take cognizance
of political cases. Neither the manner of
instituting the suit nor the court in which
It has been brought is proper. The suit
to enjoin the alleged misappropriation and
expenditure of public money involves
the startling proposition that the Auditor
and Treasurer may be enjoined from pay
ing any claim whatever, and this the at
torney asserted, is not the law in Cali
fornia.
In this way the civil service principle in
the city could be tested. If the Civil Ser
vice Commission removed a deputy for
one of its own candidates, then an action
would lie, but not in the way sought by
the present suit.
"Where the division is to be made no
one has been able to tell and no one ever
will be able. No such division can be. The
law did not Intend that there should be.
Turning then to a discussion of the
motives of the case. Attorney McEnerney
declared that the action has been brought
simply and solely to tie up the commis
sion. The court, he contended, has abso
lutely no right to Issue an Injunction pre
venting the Civil Service Commission
from holding examinations. The commis
sion has the right to hold as many ex
aminations as it pleases. If there is an
honest effort and purpose to best the civil
service clause of the charter the only
legal way to do so is for some head of a
municipal department to refuse to accept
an officer supplied by the Civil Service
Commission.
When the consolidation act was adopted
there was a merging of the city and
county. This means that there was the
creation of a new political entity distinct
from both city and county, or the county
died. From either point of view it is Im
possible for the county government act to
have authority. The law declares that
the operation of this act shall be abso
lutely uniform, which is impossible if the
act applies to San Francisco. The at
torney inclined to the opinion that there
was not under the consolidation act the
creation of a new political corporation,
but the merging of the county in the city.
This removes from San Francisco all op
eration of the county government act.
This has been decided emphatically, defi
nitely and clearly by the Supreme Court,
yet. contended the attorney, the men who
are seeking to tie up the Civil Service
Commission, paralyze its labors and Inter
rupt the orderly government of the great
est political corporation in the State, de
clare that the county government act ap
plies to part of San Francisco and part
of it does not.
Attorney McEnerney then be^an the
discussion of his main theme. He de
clared that In the meaning of the consti
tution of California and of the statutes
the City and County of San Francisco is
purely, in every legal sense, only a muni
cipal corporation over which the county
government act has absolutely no author
ity. The county of San Francisco has
been dead for forty-four years, he said.
It has never exercised the functions of a
county in the way provided by law.
The argument presented by Attorney
McEnerney was exhaustive, logical and
brilliant. From the outset he contended
that the Injunction temporarily granted
should not be made permanent. He in
sisted that the enly evil which can be In
flicted will be by an interference with
what Is now the organic law of San Fran
cisco. It is a presumption of law that en
actments, solemly made, representing the
organized existence of communities shall
be considered >gal. Courts have hesi
tated to the last moment to question all
enactments. Every effort has been made
to protect such laws and Judge Hebbard
should hesitate, therefore, to make per
mar.ent an injunction which interrupts
the operation cf charter government in
Pan Francipco. No_ injury, he contended,
ran be done by dissolving the injunction
and permitting the issues to be deter
mined by the appellate court.
torney I*ane and Garret McEnerney have
contended that the suit which has been
Instituted to determine the issue has not
be^n brought In a legal form. Campbell
insists that the method to secure the de
sired remedy Is justuied by the highe3t
Slate and national courts. At noon Mr.
Campbell concluded his argument and at
the end of the recess Garret McEnerney
began.

Francisco Is a City and County.
