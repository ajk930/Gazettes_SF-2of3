WASHINGTON. Dec. 11.â In ths
House to-day a resolution
was adopted for the appolnt
,ment of r. special committee
of five members to Investi
gate the death of Oscar L. Booz of Bris
tol, Pa., which .occurred recently as a
result of hazing received while a cadet
at West. Point. This course was taken
over the head of the Military Committee,
which reported in favor of allowing the
War Department to conduct the inquiry.
When the House met to-day Hull, chair
man of the Military Affairs Committee,
reported back from that committee a sub
stitute for the Drigga resolution for an
Investigation of the alleged "hazing" of
Booz at West Point. The substitute Is as
follows:
"Wheroas.lt Is alleged In the newspapers
that Oscar L. Booz of Bristol. Pa., for
merly a cadet at the United States Mili
tary Academy at West Point, died at hl3
home from injuries purporting to have
been the result of hazing Inflicted upon
him by certain unknown cadets of the
said military academy: and
"Whereas, The Secretary of War is now
making Investigation of the facts,
"Resolved, That scid Secretary is re
quested to report the result of such in
vestigation to the House of Representa
tives, together with such recommenda
tions as he may see fit to make."
The report of Secretary Root, together
with that of Superintendent Mills, Is at
tached to the resolution. The presenta
tion of the resolution and the reading of
the reports of the Secretary of War and
Colonel Mills aroused great Interest in
the House.
Slayden of Texas, a member of the
Military Committee, expressed the opin
ion that the reports concerning hazing
at West Point had been grossly exagger
ated.
Clayton of NeVr York, who was himself
a graduate of West Point, defended the
Military Academy. He said there was no
necessity for bringing up the Dreyfua
case. The record of the academy stood
for itself.
"Why not Investigate, then?' asked
Wanger.
i "The academy fears no Investigation,"
replied Clayton. "The son of a washer
1 woman and a tuillionaire are on the same
footing when they enter the academy."
From his own personal experience Clay
ton said he knew that the reports of haz
ing were greatly exaggerated. The sen
timent of the cadets was against brutality
or doing anything unfair. Hazing as it
was practiced years ago, he said, had
been stamped out. â¢ -
, Hay of Virginia favored a Congressional
investigation not, he said, because he be
lieved there was any ground" for the
charges, but because an investigation
would vindicate the academy and the ca
dets.'
In concluding the debate Hull said he
had little faith in Congressional investiga
tions. It was erroneous to believe tha't
the army was interested in shielding
West Point, and he told what had been
done in the last five years to stop hazing.
"If the charges of hazing should be
proved," asked Driggs, "is there any law
which could reach the cadets who par
ticipated?"
"The gentleman can answer that ques
tion as well as I." answered Hull. "But
if proved, If the War Department does not
take steps to dismiss the guilty ones from
the academy, Congress will."
Drlgg3 of New York, the author of the
original resolution, protested vigorousiy
against the adoption of the substitute res
olution, as it did no't include provision for
an investigation of the general subject of
hazing at West Point with a view of put
ting a permanent stop to such practices.
He declared that the practice of infam
ously hazing "plebcs" at West Point was
notorious. Driggs said that he would
be in favorof abolishing the academy it
these brutal practices coold not be stop
ped. {Applause.)
Wanger of Pennsylvania, who ap
pointed Cadet Booz, spoke In favor of a
Congressional investigation. He said he
did not presume to know the exact de
tails, but responsible persons had made
statements relative to the case which had
profoundly moved the people of the coun
try. The gross outrages known to have
been committed at the academy in the
past, he said, had aroused the conviction
that the officers of the academy and of
the army were so Jealous of the fair
name of the academy that they guarded
it as indiscreetly as the officers of France
guarded the Dreyfus scandal. He was
not opposed to receiving any Information
the Secretary of War had on the subject,
or to the proposed Inquiry by the War
Department, but he Insisted that only a
Congressional inquiry would satisfy the
country. Such an investigation would
bring out the facts and lead to action
which would forever prevent cadets being
the victims of hazing In the future. Wan
ger said that at the proper time be would
offer a substitute for the committees 'res
olution providing for an Investigation by
a special committee of five members of
the House who should have the power to
send for persons and papers, and If neces
sary proceed to West Point, and that the
committee should report within sixty
days. Wanger's resolution for a special
committee of five to investigate the case
was then adopted without division. The
Speaker appointed the following members
to constitute the committee: Marsh of
Illinois, chairman; Wanger of Pennsylva
nia. Smith of Iowa. Driggs of New York
and Clayton of New York.

WASHINGTON. Dec. lL-Colonel Mill*.
superintendent of the Military Academy,
has entered the broadest denial, based
upon a full Investigation made by himself
of the report that the- lata Cadet Oscar
Booz was hazed and otherwise mistreated
at the academy. The Secretary of War
has transmitted Colonel Mills' report t >
the House Committee on Military Affairs
in answer to the House resolution on the
subject, and has accompanied it by the
statement that at the instance of Colonel
Mills he has appointed the board, con
sisting of Major-General Brooke, Colonel
Gillespie and Colonel Clous, to meet at
West Point on the 15th Inst., or as soon
as possible thereafter, to Investigate, noc
only the Booz case, but also the methods
employed at the academy to prevent haz
ing.
Colonel Mills' statement is quite long.
He says he had no personal knowledgo
of Booz, whose record at the academy he
submits to demonstrate that there was
no medical evidence of any mistreatment,
but that his resignation was attributed
to weak eyes and a poor record in stud
ies. Having carefully Questioned cadeta
who were classmates of Booz. Colonel
Mills finds that the cadet had no trouble
prior to August 6. 1S3S. when he had a
ttst fight, witnessed by six cadets, all of
whom are now at the academy. Two
classmates of Booz testified that the lat
ter invited them to attend the fight; that
he went to it and engaged in It willing
ly, and in the beginning was the ag
gressor. All the cadets testify that the
encounter was short, of little severity
and Booz was In no way Injured or
marked. 'â¢
On the testimony of the cadets Colonel
Mills al3o denied specifically the story
that tabasco sauce was poured down
Booz's throat, and that be was called
"Bibles" or ridiculed on account of hU
religious belief. In conclusion he aakj

CHAFFEE SENDS AN APOLOGY.
BERLIN, Dec. 11.â The German Foreign
Office authorizes the following statement
regarding the Waldersee-ChafTee Incident,
based upon a cable dispatch just received
from Field Marshal von Waldersee:
"General Chaffee wrote Field Marshal
von Waldersee a letter In a rough tone.
Field Marshal von Waldersee refused to
receive it, returning the same to General
Chaffee. The latter then wrote a sec

WASHINGTON, Dec. 1.â The War De
partment has received a report from Gen
eral Chaffee of the incident that' occurred
at Peking in connection with his repre
sentations to Field Marshal von Walder
eee. -It appears that General Chaffee did
use some pretty vigorous language In
protesting against the thieving and loot
ing of tho foreifpi troops'.- -What particu
larly hurt Count von' Waldersee wa* a
poluted reference * by. General Chaffee to
the fact that this disgraceful and unmili
tary practice of looting was being in
dulged in, not by tho nun. who did the
fightins and opened the way to Peking
but by the "late comers who had "borne
.none- of the brunt of conflict and hard
ship. Waldersee himself did not reach
Peking until long: after the expeditionary
force had occupied the town. Â«f
It is recognized here officially that Gen

PARIS, Dec. 11â An official of the
French Foreign Office, speaking 1 about
General Chaffee's position in regard to
looting, said: . . â¢
"The fact is principally, regrettable be

commander of all 'the . forces in China, or

TIENTSIN, Nov. 5. â The International
expedition to Paoting-Fu, after repeated
postponements, at length commenced
operations on October. 12, when, from Pe
king and Tientsin, there started simul
taneously three columns.
The Tientsin columns were commanded
by General Baellond of the French army
and Major General Lome Campbell, the
former taking a direct route to the north
of the waterway to Paoting-Fu and the
latter a more circuitous route to the
south of the same. At Machou, a small
walled city, on the 17th of October,. Gen-,
eral Campbell received a letter, from' Gen
eral Baellond, stating that . the French
had occupied Paoting-Fu on the 13th Inst;
without opposition, having anticipated
tho . actions of the allies and broken the
promise that they '.would await other
commands.
On the 18th Tienchou Hslen was reached,
and on the 21st the British forces reached
Paoting-Fu. s-1^'4
The fanti, or- chief provincial treasury

international court of Inquiry was insti

DENVER. Dec 11.â J. B. Comstock,
the day operator, and the night
operator, whose name is said to
toe Williams, were driven out of
Sedalia by unknown men at 8
o'clock to-night. Both are non-union
operators, filling the places of strikers on
the Santa Fe. Comstock was shot through
the upper portion of the right arm. The
wound is painful, but is not dangerous
unless blood poisoning should set In.
Three men of a crowd of seven men
loitering about the Santa Fe station at Se
dalia entered the room where Comstock
End Williams were Fitting. "Throw up
your hands," said one of the men draw
ing a revolver. Both operators obeyed
and while one man held a revolver the
other two searched the operators for wea
pons.
Williams was standing close to the
<5oor and while Comstock was being
Fcarched he bounded through the door.
The man with the revolver dashed aftfer
him and tired two shots. Williams dis
appeared in the darkness and has not
been heard of since. It is thought that
either he is hiding in the mountains or
that he was fatally wounded and died
Fome distance from the station. Comstock
believes Williams was shot.
After the escape of Williams Comstock
was ordered away. Comstock turned to
run out of the depot and the man with
the revolver shot him. He fell and the
men fied. A few minutes later a Colorado
and Southern train came in and its crew
found Comstock and he was taken to St.
Anthony's Hospital in Denver.
At Castle Rx>ck last night a party of
masked men took out Operator H. R. Wil

Special detectives have been sent out
from Denver by the Santa Fe to hunt
down the men who attacked the non
union operators. At the headquarters of
the Order of Railway Telegraphers in this
city this statement was made. It was
fa id that the shooting of Comstock was

"The people are with us," said the head

aper Mudge Fays that the Santa Fe strike
is a complete failure and that the road is
finding no difficulty in filling the places
made vacant by the operators. He still
maintains his place at the key in the gen
eral telegraph office, however. In an in
terview Mr. Mudge said to-night:
"Our business is running normal again.
We have kept train movements steady
under the train order system. It has been
satisfactory enough to run the trains in
the same way that other Western roads
run them. But the Santa Fe has block
signals, as the others have not. We are
using the block signals from Chicago to
Newton again. I gave the order for re
sumption this morning.
"The bogus message for operators to go

his name was forged to. went on the
wires sure enough. It was taken on* the
wire in the general office, at the shop and
at Holliday. Where it originated I don't
know. Mr. Newman's personal message
of protest reached me late yesterday
afterncon. There has been nothing further
heard about the matter since I replied last
night."
Mr. Mudge'B reply was as follows:
"Your wire to-day. Am also surprised
that any official should forge your name.
Do not believe It has been done. Please
give me facts and name of official that 1
may investigate. There will be no ob
ject In endeavoring to get the men back
to work, as we are refusing to permit
them to go back, as you very well know."
All the striking operators received no

ness with which It may be intrusted and
that as far as the strikers are concerned

Clay of Georgia Opposes the
Measure Before the
Senate.
Sharp Debate Occurs Over the Mon
tana Senator ship Tangle,
but No Action Is
Taken.
WASHINGTON. Dec. ll.-The first
speech In opposition to the ship subsidy
bill In the Senate was delivered to-day
by Clay of Georgia, one of the minority
members of the Committee on Commerce,
which reported It to the Senate. He is
recognized as one of the most vigorous
opponents of the bill In the Senate and
during nearly two hours he was accorded
close attention by Senators on both sides
of the chamber. Hanna, who expects to
reply to Clay's argument, gave him a
particularly uttentivo hearing.
In the early part of the session a lively
colloquy was precipitated over the refer
ence to committee of the oleomargarine
bill, just passed by the House. It finally
went to the Committee on Agriculture.
This was a victory for the friends of tha
bill.
There also was a sharp debate over the
Montana Senatorshlo cas<e, but no action
was taken, the matter by consent going
over temporarily.
To-morrow no business session of the
Senate will be held as the time wll! b<?
devoted to the centennial of the estab
lishment of the seat of government In
Washington.
The resolution offered yesterday by
Hanna for the appointment by the presi
dent pro tern of a committee of three
Senators to make the necessary' arrange
ments for the inauguration of the Presi
dent on the 4th of March was adopted
without debate.

BRITAIN VOTES WAR FUNDS.
Supplementary Fund of Sixteen Mil
lion Pounds Advanced.
LONDON, Dec. 11.â When the House cf
Commons went into committee of the sup
ply to-day William St. John Broderick,
the Secretary of Staie for War. intro
duced the supplementany estimates of
Â£16,000,000 for the army. He admitted that
the Government's expectations had not
been oversanguine and that it anticipated
that the expenditure to March 1 would
be little short of the outlay the Govern
ment had been incurring during the whole
fiscal year. He added that the Govern
ment's policy was to pursua the war wl'h
the strongest possible forco -and a con
tinuous stream of supplies so that peaco
may the more quickly be achieved Mr
Broderick added that he believed the Govl
ernment was now asking for the final sum
required for this abnormal war.
Sir William Vernon Harcourt. Liberal
expressed the opinion that the House had
not heard a more distressing confession.
Although his original opinion of the cir
cumstances leading to the unhappy war
was not altered he would oppose the vote
The whole secret of the Government's
miscalculations, he said, was this: It was
in no wise a conflict of governments, but
a. conflict of races. He thought that now
they had overthrown the governments
of the republics by overwhelming force
of arms they should deal with the brave
burghers remaining, not by perpetually
increasing the expenditure but by a noi
lcy of reconciliation.
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman said
that the Secretary of State for War had
made a frank statement as to the new
condition of affairs, and he expressed a
hope that the Government would bring
home the volunteers. Mr. Broderick re
plied that It would be Impossible for the
Government to give any pledge on that
point, as Lord Kitchener must be sup
pled with many mounted men.
Timothy Healy remarked: "A war be
gun in braggadocio and hypocrisy has
brought humiliation to England, and the
culprit is In the Colonial Omce."
Henry Labouchere expressed the opin
ion that the guerrilla warfare In South
Africa might last for two years. The
supplementary estimate of Â£16,000,000 was
then adopted by a vote of 284 against 8
The House having gone Into Committee
of Ways and Means, the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, Sir Michael Hicks-Beach ex
plained that the existing borrowing pow
ers of the Chancellor amounted to only
Â£5,000,000. He moved, therefore, a resolu
tion authorizing him to borrow by war
loan exchequer bonds or treasury bills
Â£11,000.000. He said he did not expect to
use his borrowing powers until February
or March, and he asked the House to
postpone any discussion on the subject
until the third reading next week.
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman ex
pressed his approval of the . resolution
which was agreed to.- The committee"

THE HAGUE. Dec. 11.â The Transvaal
legation says It is authorized to contra
dict the report that EVnperor Nicholas
has telegraphed to Mr. Kruger an inti
mation that he will net receive him.
â¢ BERLIN, Dec. ll.-In the Reichstag to
day, on the resumption of the debate on
the estimates. Herr Bebel, the Socialist
leader, concurring in the remarks in the
Reichstag yesterday of the Imperial
Chancellor, Count von Bulow, as to Ger
many's policy in the Transvaal question,
said:
"We have every reason to be on friendly
terms with England without thereby re
stricting our freedom. At the same
time I consider England's methods of
waging war in the Transvaal as being
barbarous and detestable."
Continuing. Herr Bebel trenchantly
criticized the German rebuff to Mr. Kru
ger. saying that If President Loubet re
ceived him Emperor William pould have
done the same. For two hours Herr Be
bel bitterly criticized the general policy
of the Government, and the Chamber,
which was evidently ready to touch other
questions than those of the budget, fol
lowed him intently.
"We are only at the beginning of a
financial and economical depression," he
said. "The official figures show that the
finances of the empire are in a horrible
condition.
"Emperor "William." he continued,
"ought, least of all, to have turned hla
back upon Mr. Kruger, especially after
the telrgram of 1S96. which the Socialists
disapproved, but which the Center and
the whole Right approved."
What the Imperial Chancellor had said
yesterday in the Reichstag was precisely
what he (Herr Bebel) had said in 1896.
Herr Riohter, the Radical leader, who
spoke even more powerfully, said he had
come to the conclusion from the speech
of Count von Posadowsky-Wehner that
the latter was not in accord with the
views and promises of the Imperial Chan
cellor.
After criticizing Emperor William for
"allowing himself on very Important oc
casion to be carried away by momen
tary impulses," Herr Btbel said that this
instability had crept into Germany's for
eign and internal policies. He demanded
succinct explanations from Count von Bu
low, Count Posadowsky-Wehner. General
von Gossler and Admiral von TirpHz as to
why a number of steps had been decided
upon, such as the use of voluntary con
tributions through Emperor William for
building gunboats for Chinese waters
without permission from the Reichstag.
Count Posadowfiky-Wehncr in the
course of a long speech, principally de
fensive, paid:
"I cannot admit that the American
President spoke about tariff retaliation as
Herren Bebel and Rlchter have asserted,
for those important prohibitions which we
bave Issued are minimal as against the
still existing American prohibitory meas
ures."
He went on to advise members of all
parties to be careful when conducting the
tariff debate not to furnish ammunition
to the enemies of Germany.

CHICAGO, .Dee. 11.â Captain George â¢
Streeter, who has gained much
notoriety because of his claim to
1S6 acres of land washed up by
Lake Michigan and abutting the
city of Chicago, haSj found a new title to
distinction. He says he , is the step
father of the beautiful Princess Chlmay,
who, after her divorce from her titled
husband married the Hungarian gypsy,
Rlgo. The Princess Chlmay was formerly
known as Clara Ward, daughter of Eben
Ward, a Detroit millionaire. Captain
Streeter says his wife was a cousin of
Eben Ward and the mother of Clara
Ward and that the child was adopted by
the lumberman. Â©
"Mrs. Streeter Is the mother of Clara
Ward, who afterward became the Prin
cess Chlmay," said Streeter to-day. "She
was then the wlfo of John Jordan, who
was killed In the Civil War. Eben Ward
wished to adopt the child, whose name
was Maud Jordan, and bring here up as
his own. Since the father of the child
was dead, Mrs. Jordan consented. I was
at that time working for Eben Ward as
draughtsman and shipbuilder and I well
remember the day the baby was brought
to Ward's house in a cracker box. It
was by mutual agreement of the child'?
mcther and adopted father that she was
called Clara Ward.
"Several years afterward I fell In lo\*e
with Mrs. Jordan and it was about ten
years after the adoption of the child that
we were married. The child grew up as
Mr. Ward's own daughter. My wife re
ceived a sunstroke a few years ago and
since then has been scarcely herself. She
was a woman of the best connections and
refinement. She has. of course, felt keen
ly the disgrace brouprht on all her rela
tions by the actions of the- Princess.
"My wife is also a niece of Mrs. O W
Potter of Lake Shore drive. Her mother
was Mrs. Mulholland. sister of John Ward
of Detroit. I understand that Mr. O W
Potter does not admit any relationship
with my wife. Well, we never sought to
work into the good graces of that family.
SO ..UJ S not a matter Â°f great Importance."
There Is no relationship between mv
family and Mrs. Streeter," said O W
Potter to-night. . "They probably have in
mind some other Potter in that connec
tion. I do not know Captain Streeterâ
never saw him In my life."

WASHINGTON, Dec. 11.â Consideration
of the bill for the reduction of the war
tajces -was begun in the House to-day.
Payue <-Â«f New Voik, chairman of tht
Committee on Ways and Means, opened
tie debate. He said that in reporting the
pending bill the committee fe!t as though
they had gone to the farthest limit in me
amount of reduction with due regard to
the preveution of otticits. The sixty-five
million dollars remaining after t!:e reduc
tion propound by the committee took effect
would not equal the extraordinary ex
j.-enses sure to follow as a result of the
Spanish war. Among such expenses was
the interest en the bonds issued to prose
cute the war. amounting to live millions;
the increased army, which both sides ad
mit should amount to 100.000 fur the next
two or thrtt- years. This increase in ex-
I>endituresÂ» would amount at 'east to sixty
million dollars. The increase in naval ex,
jfnditures tat equipment, together with
\p.i pensions growing out of the late war,
would Â«)dd to our expenditures ten mil-
"-â¢While there is no reason from any do
mestic riUMB to apprehend any disaster
to business during the next leÂ»v years,"
eald he, "yet there is a possibility of for
eign complications which miftht have that
result, of course, depression in business
would mean a loss ox revenue. A large
portion cf uur importations on which taniX
duties are paid is of goods going directly
into the manufacture of articles both for
oi^r domestic and foreign trade. Anything
li.iU cuts off this trade In either direction
would result in loss of revenue.
"Some members of the minority of the
committee have proposed to abolish all
the war revenue and offer in place there
of an Income tax. Of course." said he. "It
is perfectly obvious to every thinking man
that this would cause an immediate defi
ciency in our revenues. The enactment
of a new income law would not furnish
b. dollcr of additional revenue. We have
already an income tax law upon the stat
ute books which has not been repealed.
The Supreme Court has decided it uncon
stit'iional. What reason is there to
suppose that a new enactment of this kind
would m<-et with any other fate?
â¢Another proposition has been made by
the minority to abolish the entire addi
tional tax upon beer. This would result
in an additional reduction of twenty
three millions of e'ollars. 1*. would pro
rfuoe the grossest injustice. What argu
ment is there in favor of reducing the en
tire tax on beer which does not apply
with as gTeat force to the reduction of the
entire adrt;iional tax on tobacco, amount
ing to eighteen millions of dollars, or the
tax on bankers and brokers, amounting
to nearly four millions of dollars, and the
remaining; taxes amounting to fifteen mif
lions of dollars? Certainly the tax upon
beer should never be wiped out until ev
ery other vestige of the war taxes Is re
moved."
Swanson nt Virginia, a member of the
Committee on Ways and Means, followed,
presenting the views of the minority.
Swanpon paid the Democratic party fully
recognized the urgent necessity for a re
duction in the revenues of this Govern
ment. During four years taxation had
increased over $260,000,000. and he declared
that if this heavy burden was continued
business and commerce would seriouslv
suffer. He expressed regret that the Ee
publicans had failed to avail themselves
of the present excellent opportunity to
devise a more just, equitable and perma
nent system of taxation. . He arjrued that
there should be a reformation of the
tariff and an abolition of the customs
duties which have created trusts and mo
nopolies. He insisted also that this Gov
ernment should collect more revenue from
capital, incomes and profits, rather than
from the consumption and business and
the occupation of tht people; that "taxes
should be levied upon what a man has
and not upon what he needs."
He said there should be a reduction
made now Â«n the revenues of at least $70 -
OOO.dO. instead of $10,000,000. With the or
ganization cf a home government in Cuba,
with the pacification of the Philippine
Islands and with a settlement of the Chi
nes* complications, all of which the ad
ministration assured in less than two
year*, there ou^ht to be an Immense re
duction in Government expenses.
Swanson asserted that the on!y persons
who were benefited by a large surplus
in the treasury were those who were seek
ing extravagant and unjust appropria
tions, the national Danks that were de
sirous of continuing the large govern
mental deposits free of Interest, and the
bondholders, who desired the Government
to redeem their bonds at a high and an
exorbitant premium.
In conclusion Swanson stated that the
minority woujd move to recommit the bill
with instructions to provide for the re
duction of at least $70,000,000.

What Thin People Need to Round Off

TVhat thin folks need is flesh or muscle,

tlonrd every person should have a certain
amount of excess Cesh. but to be plump
does not necessarily mean to be fat
Fat is undes-irublt; It clog's and retards
the action of the muscles. Interferes â¢with
the healthy action of the heart and lungs
and when w ry r-xcessivc. predisposes too

Common sense would suRgcst that if one
wishes to become fleshy and plump the
thir.fr most needed would be flesh forming
food â that is. albuminous foods like eges
beef, oatmeal, etc " "
The kinds of food which make flesh are
the foods we have on our tables every
day; but the trouble Is that our stomachs
from weakness or derangement of some
kind do net promptly ana properly digest
Really, the principal reason so many peo-
ple remain thin is because their stomachs
do rot properly and completely digest and
a^s-Imilate the flesh forming beefsteak and
tpps we eat every day.
There ?re thousands of such people, and
they ere really dyspeptics, although they
may net suffer any particular pain or in-
convenience from their stomachs.
If such parsons and all thin people
would lake after their meals some simple
and natur.il digestive, like Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets, the food would be quickly

Terrible Experience of John Broder

Storm on Kotzebue

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CAHTO, Dec. 11.â News reached here by
the overland stage driver of the awful
experience of a prospector adrift In a
waterlogged boat seventy-two hours. The
steamer Selma, which arrived at Fort
Bragg yesterday, had on board a passen
ger from Skaguay, Alaska, named John
Broderick. Mr. Broderick had a terrible
experience on Hodum Inlet, Kotzebue
Sound. He was shipwrecked, and for
seventy-two hours was adrift in a water
logged boat, having 'no assistance what
ever and without anything to eat.
Broderick left tho coast about a year
ago with two other prospectors and sailed
for tho Kotzebue country. Having pros
pected that country for some time with
out having any, marked success, he, with
ten others, left for Point Hope, arriving
there about the middle of November, and
not* finding what they expected they
coasted along: .the shore beaded f or , the
Kowak River Â¦ country. After being out
eeveral weeks a storm came up and five of
the boats were blown ashore. Broderlck'a
boat being without, sails made slow pas
sage,' and the fury "of the storm became
such that he found himself unable to get
to shore, and he was soon drifting help
lessly about in the Inlet.
He was alone and the storm raged bo
heavy that he could" do nothing at all
with his boat. - The (second morning It
was capsized. After hours of hard labor
and suffering he succeeded In righting It,
and for several . hours remained on his
knees in the stern of the boat with ' only
his head above water. The boat was tossed
about by the water, : and when the storm
abated , Broderick Â¦"Â¦ drifted ashore, where
he was found several hours later, uncon
scious, by passing prospectors. *

STOCKTON, Dec. 11.â The board of

The resolution to-day was directed at the

had escaped. On November 20 there were
156S patients in the asylum. Salaries to
the amount of $$000 32 were paid for the
month.
The medical superintendent was au
thorized to purchase 113 tons of Tesla

and $406 25 worth of California gray wool

After, the usual preliminary allegations
the complaint of plaintiff relates "that the
defendants, acting In concert and In their
official capacity, have threatened and do
now threaten to and will, unless re

Jones prayed Judgment that an injunc

from attempting to remove or doing any
act whatever toward his removal from
the position of steward of the hospital.
He also asked that a temporary restrain

Jones was discharged some months ago
and was afterward reinstated by the
board of managers. Subsequently Gov
ernor Gage made some changes In the
personnel of the board of managers and
recently Dr. King again discharged
Steward Jones.
The ground upon which Jones bases his
action is that his attempted removal is
for political reasons alone. Not that it
was caused by any political action which
he himself ha a ever taken, but that the
medical superintendent Is "doing politics"
himself.

Wheeler attended the session of the after

did not, except to say that it sometimes
brought to a paper a certain authority to
have it known that its columns expressed
always the views and sentiments of one
man, particularly If that one is a man
whose views are clear and well consid

rather a running criticism of the elements

reader. "A newspaper is an educator,"
he said, "and in current things people are

MODERN NEWSPAPER FOR EDITORS
Special Dispatch to The CalL
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Dec 1Lâ
An important addition was made to the
Stanford latr library to-day by the re
ceipt of S500 volumes of reports. ThÂ«
books were received direot from Minne
apolis, where a complete working library
was purchased last summer by Mrs. Stan
ford upon the recommendation .of Dr.
Nathan Abbott, the head of the Stanford
law school. The set. completes the record
of English cases and gives Stanford/ one
of the best working libraries in the coun
try, y
Dr. Abbott, dean of the law school, had
the following to say concerning this ad
dition to the facilities of his department:
"I am more than gratified by the re
ceipt of such a valuable collection of law
books. The set practically contains all
the English and Canadian reports. Some
of the volumes are rare and costly and
would easily bring $50 apiece in the open
market. The books will also be useful to
students in the history and economics de
partments. Stanford now has a working
library that will compare favorably with
that of any of the big law schools In
America. So far as our reports qf the
English cases are concerned we are
equaled only by Harvard, which has prob
ably the finest law library In the world.
"This addition marks one of the im
portant steps In the development of our
school and Is Indicative of a healthy fu
ture growth. We ha% ? e recently received
the private libraries of Francis E. Spencer
and Stephen J. Field, Â¦which, aside from
their intrinsic worth, have much of sen
timental value. The student who works
with the same volumes from which Judge
Field wrote his famous mining and water
decisions while on the bench of the United
States Supreme Court should receive an
inspiration from them."

srulded by the views of the paper. But In
deeper things people are In the habit of
seeking a paper that believes as they do
and are content with having It coincide
with their opinions. The minor currents
are made by the newspapers, therefore
they have a great responsibility in guid
ing those currents."
In comparing the newspaper and the
university President Jordan said: "Aca
demic freedom Is always to be found In
the colleges of this country. The same
sort of freedom a university likes to feel
a newspaper likes to feel; but freedom of
thought and freedom of speech sometimes
become carelessness of thought and care
lessness of speech. The more shining a
mark may be the more some papers wish
to throw mud at It. These are the real
enemies of free speech."
President Jordan then commented light
ly on some of the Journalistic frailties and
closed with his thanks for the privilege of
addressing the association. He was fol
lowed by. S. M. Haskell of tho Pomona
Progress,- who spoke of the newspaper
from the standpoint of the editor. The
remainder of the evening session was
taken up with- short addresses by A. J.
Pillsbury of the Tulore Register, who
spoke on the subject of Irrigation; Dun
can McPherson,' who spoke of the neces

and Uncle George Bromley, who Just

Does Not "Want Fun Poked at 'His
Â¦ Name as Was Done to His
Predecessor.
â¢ WASHINGTON. Dec 11â A formal re
quest for protection was made by the
new Persian Minister In his address de
livered on the occasion of his presenta
tion to-day to the President.
. "I am pleased to hope. Mr. President,"
he Bald,' "that your Excellency and your
Government will design to accord to me
your support and protection in order to
carry to a happy end the mission with
which I am charged."
Isaac Khan Mofakhammed Dovelt,
the Minister, had In mind in making thia
statement the discourteous treatment of
his predecesssor. Hadji Hassan Ghouli
Khan Mohamet El Vessari, at the handa
of an American humorist. The retire
ment of Hadji Hassan Ghouli Khan was
due to the attention paid him and his
peculiar name by newspaper paragraph
ers. .
The Shah, it was said at the time, waÂ«
displeased and this probably accounts for
the fact that ten years elapsed before
a new Minister was accredited to this
Government. Isaac Khan explained in
his address to-day that the object of his
appointment is "to draw still closer the
ties of friendship and to aid In thg de
velopment of commercial intercourse be
tween the two Governments."
The President' cordially responded to the
Minister's address, bespeaking for him
"agreeable association , with the commu
nity among whom you come to dwell."

COLUMBUS, Ohio, Dec 1Lâ The Su

Monnett, late Attorney General of Ohio,
to that â¢ court aealnst the Standard Oil
Company and Its officers. Including John

The court divided as follows: For dis

When D. K. Watson was Attorney Gen

the Standard Oil trust because it had ex

to public policy. â.
On March 20, 1892, the Supreme Court
ousted the company. On November 8 lSi>7
Mr.-Monnett filed the Information in con

following a lino of policy that would in

STANDARD OIL
WINS OHIO CASE
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 11. â John E. Fra
sier was arraigned to-day and L. L. Bte
vens, who at present is in Bakersfield, is
wanted, to answer to the charge of Bteal
ingr 230 barrels of crude petroleum from
"William Dryden of L'niversity. But this
theft, according: to a number of Oil men
who have been victimized and the investi
gation of detectives, is only one of a series
of similar larcenies. A conspiracy has
been unearthed which would have caused,
large losses to the oil producers if the
very boldness of the thieves had not
worked their undoing:. As it Is the oil men
believe that at leas.t 20u0 barrels, valued
at over $2wO, of their product have been
stolen and sold by Frasier and Stevens.
In every instance the petroleum was
taken from unlocked receiving tanks. The
thieves operated in two distinct methods.
That aJleged to have been adopted by Ifra
eier was to hire the drivere of oil tank
wagons to go at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morn
ing to some receiving tank, Frasier rep
resenting to them that he had a rush or
der thai must be tilled at once. For such
tripe he was willing to pay special rates.
Frasier would meet the teamsters at the
tank, which, not being guarded and being
far from the wells, was practically at the
mercy of the thief. When the wagxm tank
was filled be would direct the driver to
the Oil Storage and Trans po nation Com
pany's warehouse, where the oil was de
livered and in perfectly good faith credit
ed to Frasier's account. Recently Frasier
received $300 on account for oil left with
tho company for sale.
Stevens for some time acted as engineer
for Martin & Company's pumping plant
end Is eaid to have sold purloined oil di
rectly to consumers. He made his cus
tomers themselves come to the receiving
tanks, gave them other people's oil and
received cash on delivery. .
Frasier was held in default of $2000 bail
and a detective left for Bakersfield to-day
to arrest Stevens.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Dee. 11.â
Manager Glldersleeve received a reply to
day to his -telegram sent last Thursday
to the management of the Columbia foot
ball team. Gildersleeve was asked to
name the terms which he would offer the
Eastern team should they come to Cali
fornia during the holidays. This seems
to be a withdrawal by Columbia from
the agreement made some weeks ago to
make the trip for three-fourths of the
gross gate receipts and leaves the matter
bo uncertain that it is hardly likely the
two managers will bring their teams to
gether for a holiday game.
In addition to this the faculty athletic
committee has refused to allow the var
sity to make the Loa Angeles trip, bo a
second game with the Columbia team
would be impossible. As the men were
looking to the southern trip for what lit
tle pleasure they would get out of three
weeks of hard training they are not now
to willing ; to don their suits again. The
committee dealt more kindly with the
second eleven men,, granting permission
for them to Journey south arid meet the
Pomona, San Bernardino. San Diego and
Los Angeles Athletic Club teams.
Student Treasurer H. II. Taylor made
his final report to-day of the receipts of
the big game. It- shows that the total re
ceipts for the two colleges were $25,105,
of which Stanford's net- receipts were
$10,321, an excess of $2000 over last year's
game.

The dramatis personae who worked out
the plot and its many ramifications to the
tragic ending were:
Brown, coached their team from the
grand stands on the south side of the
field. A scattering of the Xlelsen Com
pany chorus with a star or two to shine
upon the diamond firmament made noise
on the east side. Between the two the
players did several things, all of which
we're foreign to baseball.
The report was unanimously adopted
A resolution for the establishment of the
free school book eyetem where not al
ready In force was adopted. A resolution
providing that no locaJ affiliated with a
national or International chartered body
ehall be permitted to Join any central
body that has affiliated or may become af
filiated with any body that has seceded
from a national or international char
tered body was unfavorably reported. A
resolution to reinstate Typographical
Union No. 12 was referred to the incom
ing executive council.
The convention voted Its aid toward se
curing for the people of Porto Rico "free
dom of assembly, oi speech and the
press."
A propoFltion to have translated" into
the Spanish languape the literature of the
bricklayers'. longshoremen's. painters'
cigar-makers' and tobacco workers'- or
ganization for distribution In Porto Rico
caused a stirring debate.
Delegate Fisher of the tobacco work
er*, ppeaking against the measure, said
that "we have as many slaves In the to
bacco factories of the South to-day as
thjrt arc In Porto Rico."
The matter waa referred to thÂ© execu
Â¦tlve ootx&elL
"lilghtr dues; appointment of organ
isers; the chartering of legal and central
bodies of colored people: In favor of
strikes where- they represent the only
means for redressing grievances; for the

and gains made without strikes; for tha
closer cementing of the- bonds between
international unions; for the employment
of an advertising solicitor for the Fed
erationiet and that the federation looks
with favor upon the formation of trade
groups."
"I want those ecab bootblacks to keep
out. I am a union boy and 1 want them
put out."
His "address" was received with yells
of applause. The report on the presi
dent's address contained the following
recommendations:
At the morning session a resolution was
presented by the cisar-m&kers' delegation
and under 6uspenion of the rules was im
mediately adopted by the convention, de
nouncing the efforts of the Resistencia to
keep members of the Cigar-makers' In
ternational Union out of the cigar fac
tories in Tampa. The support of the
Jederation Is pledged to the unions of
Tampa.
When the convention came to order at
4 o'clock President Uompera announced
thai a "gentleman wished to make an
address." whereupon a diminutive boot
black mounted the platform and shouted:
LOUISVILLE, Ky.. Dec lL-The Amer

ACTION TAKEN ON
GOWIPERS' REPORT
THE Bcial! boy who had Been a sea
son of professional baseball from
the Eighth street fence of the
Recreation grounds read in the
papers that the Nielsens would
play th* Orpheums, eo he mounted the
'.err boards yesterday afternoon Just to
*>wipe a lamp" at them. At the- end of
the third inning he fell back into the
etreet. and when revived at the hospital
all he could Ea.y was: "Dem actors is
worse on de nashnul frame dan Umpire
Huphle Smit."
After a tlma, when the full power of
respiration and vocalization had returned
to him. he launched forth again. "De
players are bad enuf. but dose gruya who
hollers and lets de steam out when six or
eeventeen errors come along one after the
other ought ter b* put in a dark room
wit mattresses on de walls."
And the tma.ll boy a.t the Orpheum-Xiel
sen baseball g-ame was about right. There
never was tuch baseball played here or
Great was the reputation of the Xlelsen
Company baseball teamâ before 2 o'clock
on December 11, 1900. It Is now Ike a stu
pendous bubble that has burst. The
stage hands and the vaudeville artists of
the Orpheum- eld the Job to a perfected
nicety. Three pitchers were pulled out of
the Nielsen chorus and annihilated. Men
played on the Orpheum team who had
never known what a to&t looked like. It
was not a case of an "abler or a better"
soldier; It was one of not quite so bad.
The Orpheum contingent, headed by
John Morrisey, Harry Orndorf and Joe
anywhere before. At the end of the match
the Orpheums had twenty-flvo or thirty
runs â the Bcorer couldn't count them â and
the Nielsens mustered up ten. But the
ppectators did not shout because they Im
agined they were at a baseball match.
They knew It was a burlesque before the
first Inning had come and gone. Last
nipht there Â¦was much noise on the west
Fide of the Orpheum Auditorium. Every
thing was dull, bitter end stale at the
same kind of an adjunct south of the Co
lumbia Theatra.

Track Notes.
be the star of the California racing
season. He brought In. three winners at
Oakland yesterday - and scarcely a day
passes that he does not appear to advan
tage In the saddle. When the modest lit
tle" fellow arrived here it was said he was
essentially a front rider, but rila master
ful handling of Dr. Bernays in the mile'
and a sixteenth handicap does not bear out
this assertion. It was the afterpiece and
the nattiest -betting affair of the after
noon. Such a preponderance of coin made
itself manifest to be bet on the chances
of Flush of Oold, carrying 100 pounds,
that the Doctor's odds went to 4^i to 1.
Florlzar had friends, The Fretter waa
not neglected and the odds about the
paper-weighted Ulloa with 82 pounds in
the saddle fell from 10 to 5. Permitting
The Fretter, Flush of Gold and Ulloa to
cut out a scorching clip to the stretch,
while he dropped in behind with Dr. Ber
nays, Dominick then began playing check
ers. Overhauling Flush of Gold, the most
stubborn of the leaders, less than a fur
long from the stand, he landed his mount
an almost easy winner in 1:46&. Florizar
finished third, three lengths back of the
favorite.
For a change the first choices did not
treat their followers bo harshly, Tenny
Belle. Vantine and Theory getting across
the line at scant odds. The attendance
was again large and the betting, so the
bookmakers said, remarkably good.
After David S, the most dangerous
looking contender in the opening sprint,
had run away a couple of times Tenny
Belle, the choice, came home by herself.
Platterer was not the recipient of a very
pleasant voyage, losing the place to Cou-
The defeat of Tyr. the two-year-old
from the Carruthers & Shields-' stable,
was a disastrous blow to the talent. The
colt ruled a 1 to 2 chance in the betting
on the mile purse run for all ages and
was mercilessly slaughtered by Socialist,
a 6 to 1 shot The latter horse seems to
have rounded to, for he covered the dis
tance, running away at the close, In
1:3924. Â¦
Walter Jennings' filly Vantine had noth
ing much to beat in her race and at odds
of 4 to 6 came in "on the bit." Tlzona
took the place quite as handily from
Talma, a 15 to 1 chance, which faced the
barrier here for the first time.
For a boy who rides many good races,
Johnny Woods can also supply some
rancid exhibitions of stupid horsemanship.
He had the mount on St. Cuthbert in the
six-furlong spin and had he gone on about
his business the horse's backers might
have cashed. Instead, with his mount
only galloping into the stretch, he allowed
O'Connor, astride the favorite, ineory, to
pull up on even terms. Then he drew his
whip and at the wire lost out rather easily
by a neck. Rides like this one keep peo
ple guessing, and there Is little wonder at
it. Lennep. a polished mud performer,
lost the show to Good Hope.
To be sure, post mortems are tiresome,
but the career of Owensboro since his
advent here has not been a nattering one
and only yesterday did his wedding day
arrive. ' The horse first started in tha
name of Albert Simons and was later sup
posedly sold to Sam Hlldreth, though by
many the sale was not considered a bona
fide one. After the colt's extremely easy
capture of the seven-furlong selling num
ber, backed down from 10 to 1, it gives his
former races a shady look. The argu
ment might be put forth that the route
yesterday wes snorter, but he won in a
way that would Indicate him a likely
candidate for the Thornton stake. If. en
tered In the same. Tim Murphy, who
seems to have camped on the trail of Al
bert Simons and apparently still thinks
that horseman the owner of Owensboro,
bid the winner up from $300 to $500. .

The transport Hancock's load of sick
and wounded soldiers was transferred
yesterday from the vessel to the Presidio.
The general appearance of the men was
much better than that presented by pre
vious shiploads. The passenger list con
tained the names of 213 soldiers and of
this number seventy-six were found fit
for Immediate discharge. The rest were
distributed throughout the various wards
of the general hospital.
The usual complaint of poor food and
poor manner of handling those soldiers
who were not sick enough to be entitled
to berths In the ship's hospital was to be
heard from the men. The 6oldiers claim
that they were not furnished the 40 cents'
worth per day of food which they are al
lowed and that the stuff which was given
'them was not fit to eat. They were also
fed like pigs, so they claim, no tables be
ing furnished them. It was a casa of stand
In line and take what was handed to
you and then find a spot on the deck clean
enough and dry enough upon which they
could sit to dispose of it. Most of the
men who returned were convalescing
from attacks of dysentery and the food
furnished was not of me kind usually
given 6lck men. In the event that a man
was unable to stomach the meat fur
nished, he could make his meal upon soda
crackers, provided he could get them.
The principal Item on the bill of fare
was a sort of stew, in soldier parlance
called "slum." This was to be had morn
ing, noon and night and It Is a matter of
record that at no stage of the voyage was
a potato or other vegetable discovered In
the mixture.
Among the Insane brought back on the
Hancock was Acting Assistant Surgeon
George Â¦%%'. Storey of Portland, Or. The
young man's mania is of a suicidal nature
and a close watch must be kept upon him.
Borne time before the young doctor's mal
ady made it necessary to confine him he
attempted to drown himself in the Passig
River and was only saved through the
heroic action of a sergeant of the Third
Artillery.
Captain F. S. Dewey, assistant surgeon,
LT. S. V., returned on the Hancock and
has been ordered home for discharge on
account of disability.
Acting Assistant Surgeon Relpsnyder,
one of the Hancock's medical staff, has
been ordered to return to the islands upon
the expiration of one month's leave of
absence.
Clara M. Zeller and Llbbie Wilson, fe
male'nurses, will return after a short
rest. Nurse Lucy G. Annan has been or
dered home for annulment of contract.
Sergeant Wunderllch of Battery C,
Third Artillery, was thrown from his
horse yesterday and severely injured.
When picked up he was unconscious and
found to be suffering from a badly cut
Jaw and numerous bruises on the head.
He was treated at the post hospital.
Harry McCann, a private of Company A,
Twenty-first Infantry, died yesterday at
the general hospital.
Twelve insane, soldiers were sent yester
day to the Government Hospital for the
Insane at Washington. Among the lot
was the colored soldier, Griffin, who is
very violent, and over whom the gruard
in charge has orders to watch most care
fully. Several times while in the insane
ward at the Presidio hospital he broke
loose, demolishing the furniture and in
juring the attendants.

After firing the shot the woman, think

she was being placed in the patrol wagon
Pickering begged to be allowed to ac
company her to the Southern station.

woman, as she aimed the pistol at her
guilty husband and fired. Fortunately for
him her aim was bad and the bullet did
no further damage than to make a hole
in his trousers.

had led her to the altar, Emma Pickering,

more damage than to tear away a portion
of his trousers.
Pickering conducts the Bristol restau
rant at 126 Fifth Btreet- He has been
married for about five years, and has two
children, one being -two years old and the
other about fourteen months.
About two weeks ago Pickering left his
wife and children and went to live with
a woman who is known as "Alice", at
the Inglewood House. After vainly
searching for him Mrs. Pickering last
night learned that he had left his place
of business shortly after 8 o'clock, pre
sumably In the company of the woman
called ""Alice." Mrs. Pickering, goaded
to desperation, went to her home and
taking a revolver wi.'ch belonged to her
husband determined to kill him. After
kissing her babies "good-by" the dis
tracted woman with the pistolâ a cheap
one of thirty-eight caliberâ in her pocket
hurriedly repaired to the house where
her husband and his female companion
were stopping. Accosting the clerk she
learned the room in which her husband
was and with murder in her eyes rapped
for admittance. Pickering, recognizing
his wife's voice, refused to admit her.
After roundly cursing her he opened the
door and asked his wife what she wanted.

ONE WOMAN SHOOTS HER SPOUSE,
ANOTHER IS TARGET FOR BULLETS
SOCIETY received a pleasant sur
prise yesterday when the engage
ment of Miss Charlotte Gashwiler
and Jose Miguel Robledo was an
nounced. Simultaneously with the
news of the engagement comes the infor
mation that the wedding of the happy
young couple will be celebrated on the
loth of January. In the apartments of the
bride's mother at the Colonial.
Miss Gashwiler Is the daughter of the
late John AV. Gashwiler, who was closely
Identified with the mining Interests of the
State in early days, and the sister of Mrs.
Samuel M. Shortrldge. She is one of the
most popular of the belles in local circles
and enjoys the well-merited reputation of
being a wit and a beauty.
Senor Robledo, the lucky man, though
owning a residence In Guatemala, was
born in Snaln. His parents belong to the
aristocratic circles of Barcelona and are
very wealthy. Senor Robledo, after grad
uating from the Madrid University, trav-
*s* " " â¢<â¢
eled in various countries and seven years
a?o assumed the management of his
father's extensive coffee plantations Jn
Guatemala.
Upon his trips to San Francisco from the
plantations Senor Robledo stopped at the
Occidental Hotel and at that hostelry,
four years ago. he first met Miss Gash
Â¦vveller, who was living at the hotel at th<Â»
time.
Tho clerks then asked for instructions
as to what was wanted, and Wells said
he was not expected to inform them and
further cautioned them not to make any
memoranda in the books unless they knew
what they were doing.
"You are supposed to know what to do,"
said Wells; "you have taken the civil ser
vice examination and ought to know what
is necessary."
Later in the day the six dismissed clerks
filed a_n affidavit with the commission In
which they represented that the assess
ment rolls were put before them and they
were told to go to work by Deputy Audi
tor Wells. The clerks said they had no
instructions as to what to do.
Wells says he wll! insist on getting ex
perienced clerks. If the Civil Service
Commission is unable to furnish them he
will employ men who have done the work
before but who have not passed the civil
service examination.
"Having work in my department of an
experienced nature, I desire to ask that
you allow me eight experienced clerks, as
the time to finish the work is limited.
You have sent me clerks who are thor
oughly unfamiliar with the duties re
quired of them, with but two exceptions.
I make this request at the suggestion of
one of the ordinary clerks that men of ex
perience should perform this particular
work."
Auditor Wells immediately sent a com
munication to the Civil Service Commis
sion, in which he requested that eight ex
perienced clerks be sent him in place of
the six ordinary clerks who were dis
charged. The Auditor's letter to the com
mission reads as follows:
The men had proceeded with their
work, when Deputy Leary, who was su
pervising It, discovered that they had ac
complished actually nothing. Leary de
manded an explanation, when six of the
men admitted that they knew absolutely
nothing about the work. Only two of the
eight. Moynihan and O'Brien, were re
tained, as they proved themselves com
petent.
The eight men were employed for the
purpose of extending the tax roll fn prep
aration for the annual report to the State
Controller. The Auditor requested the
commission to send him ten of the best
clerks it had at Its disposal. The commis
sion then sent to the Auditor: T. Philip
O'Brien, whose rank on the eligible list is
Xo. 1; Fred Head, No. 2; Fred L. Rud
dock, No. 6; Andrew T. McGreary, No. 7;
Ignatius D. Dwyer, No. 11: Ralph W.
Bliven, No. 14; Richard J. dline, Xo. 15;
Charles A. Sankey, No. 16, and H. 13.
Moynihan, No. 17.
The doubtful beauties of tho present
merit system injected by the Phelan ad
ministration into the municipal govern
ment was again exemplified yesterday
morning. Auditor Wells was obliged to
discharge six out of eight ordinary clerks
sent to him by the Civil Service Commis
sion and certificated from the eligible list.
The men had been worjtlng for just three
hours, during which time they proved
their utter Incompetency to do the re
quired work, and for that reason they
were summarily dismissed.
They Are Furnished From Eligible
List to Extend Tax Roll and
Work Only Three
Hours.

Engagement of Miss Gashwiler and
Senor Robledo Is Announced.
thf absenop of Governor Gage.
The appointment of Professor W. W.
Campbell as Dr. Heeler's successor as di
rector of Lick Observatory, made recently
by the Lick Observatory committee, was
formally ratified. The new director will
enter upon the discharge of the duties of
the office January L
"The choice," said President Wheeler,
in reporting the action of the comrrlttee.
"has practically been made for us by the
world's eminent astronomers. Letters
came to t:s from all over the world, and
but one sentiment was expressed â 'Your
choice is easy, the man who is now your
acting director.' These letters constitute
a wonderful set of credentials."-
The regents reconsidered their action of
some weeks ago, and voted the widow of
the late Director Keeler the salary which
would have been due him to January 1.
The amount which she will receive as a
result of this action Is $1537 65. President
Wheeler recommended that the salary to
January 1 be paid to Mrs. Keeler, and
General Barnes spoke eloquently in favor
of the recommendation. He eaid:
"Lick Observatory, splendid as it is. is
a helpless machine except it have the
guidance of a master mind, pre-eminent
in his department of science; a man de
voted not to money-getting and who lays
up his treasures in the heavens eternal.
Such a man was Professor Keeler. Prom
inent men from all parts of the world who
visited California have been anxious to
see Lick Observatory. We have sent
them to Mount Hamilton with letters of
introduction to Director Keeler. and we
of the committee were often his guests.
So it was that he was called upon fre
quently for generous entertainment. It
all came out of the pocket of our dead
friend.
"We really owed him a money consider
ation, and when we said to the widow
that we would pay it to her, we did only
what we had a right to do. I made the
original motion, and when I learned, after
a later meeting, that the action had been
repealed, the gift taken back, I was in
finitely chagrined and pained. This gift
was not the misappropriation of a trust
fund, but the payment of a just debt."
The motion was passed by a unanimous
vote.
Judge Wallace called attention to the
fact that three months' pay had been,
voted the widow of the late Secretary
Bonte at the same time as the gift to
Airs. Keeler had been made, and the ac
tion had been rescinded with it He
moved that three months' payâ $S25â be al
lowed Mrs. Bonte. and made an earnest
plea In her behaif. Judge Slack asked
that the motion be laid on the table until
the next meeting, to give opportunity for
Inquiry as to certain points, and with Re
gent Wallace's cpnsent the motion was
tabled.
The revised Benard plans were expected
to arrive from Paris, and were to be sub
mitted to the repents for final adoption,
but they were delayed en route from Chi
cago. Regent Reinstein announced that
they would probably arrive to-night. It
was decided to Hold a special meeting Fri
day at 2 p. m. for the inspection of the
plans.
President Wheeler made a report, and
upon his recommendation votes of
thanks were given as follows: To the
Hon. D. O. Mills for his offer to defray the
expenses, to the amount of J24.WU, of a two
years' astronomical expedition from the
Lick Observatory to an observing station
south of the equator, for the study of the
movement of etars in the line of sight;
to Mrs. Jane K. Sather for her gift of $10.
(00 outright for the establishment of the
Jane K. Sather library fund; to William
R. Heaxst for Mb gift of a collection of
Greek and Kgyptian antiquities; to the In
dependent Klectrlc Light and Power Com
pany for its gift of a WestinRhouse in
duction motor, to be used in tne depart
ment of mechanics.
tTpon the president's recommendation,
the resignations of G. W. Beattie as
reader In chemistry, and W. D. Craig as
assistant in chemistry were accepted. Y.
W. Monroe was appointed to the first po
sition and J. S. Montague to the second.
The resignation of Miss Marian Adams as
teacher of history in the Wilmerding
school was accepted, and Miss Julia M.
Edwards was appointed to. the position.
John McHenry was employed as Instruc
tor in mechanical drawing in the Wllmer
ding school, to give his entire time instead
of half of it, as In the past.

as to the correctness of this. In his opin

name their new found land In this pedan

accident; possibly to- some 'words spoken
by the Indians and misunderstood by the
Spaniards.' California was a-name given
by Cortez to the peninsula of Lower Cali

All that is to be asked is that the Department of
Agriculture be enabled to furnish each State with
four good models of highway, and surely that is not
asking too much. In the meantime the efforts of the
reformers will be continued to arousa the States and
the counties to go foiward in the work. . There ar<^
now many forces promoting the campaign of educa
tion on the subject, and it is fairly certain good re
sults will be obtained. California should be among the
foremost States of the Union fn the work of improve
ment, and the coming Legislature should provide
suitable legislation to promote it.
It will be perceived it is not the intention of tho
promoters of the movement to shift the burden and
the responsibility of constructing good roads from the
States and counties., to the Federal Government.
Such a plan is not feasible, and even if it were it
would not be desirable, for there could be no surer
way of postponing the establishment of good roads
than to make them dependent upon Federal aid. Un
der such a system States and counties would wait for
Federal aid, and very little would be done...
The plan now under consideration is to have the.
Federal Government construct one mile of model i
highway in each State. The mile is not to be con
tinuous, but is to be divided into four quarters, lo
cated in different parts of the State, the object of such
division being to show how roads should be con
structed under the different conditions of the various
localities, and thus make the object lessons more
widely useful than they would be otherwise.
GOVERNMENTAL ROAD WORK
1 \EPORTS irom Washington announce that the
Y â S promoters of the movement for improved high
ways throughout the United States have ar
ranged to urge upon Congress the advisability of
making this year to the Department of Agriculture
an appropriation of $150,000, to be used for the pur
pose of constructing model highways in various parts
of the country' for the double purpose of stimulating
road improvement and teaching how such improve
ments can be effected.
FASHION HINTS FROM PARIS.
The United States will build the canal and share
with France the glory she gained in cutting the isth
mus of Suez.
We beg to assure the Paris newspaper and the
French people that Mr. Hay's fellow citizens note no
such preference in him, and have nothing of the kind
to pardon or overlook. He is recognized here as a
sturdy American and an able diplomatist, who has
withstood all the Cabinets of Europe in the Chinese
matter and forced them to the American plan of set
tlement of that horrid situation. We rather incline
to the view that the Figaro's iil humor is due to the
passing of the last chance for the Panama ditch and
the prospect that the isthmian canal will follow the
Nicaragua route. France had the opportunity to dig
the canal, and an honorable administration of that
great work would have completed it long ago. We
cc not gird at that nation for its failure. The money
squandered would have finished the canal if honestly
applied. That it was not so applied France herself has
furnished the evidence. Ill-natured references to the
subject will onh' serve to recall the painful incidents
that clouded the close of the great career of Count At
Lesseps and tarnished the entire official character cf
France.
The Figaro's appe-il to American prejudice U
amusing rather than otherwise. It says: "The
American Secretary of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Hay) al
ready has need of much tact to make his fellow citi
zens pardon his taste for English society and for the
English Cabinet."
In this situation, if difficulty can be stirred up be
tween this country and England and delay caused
thereby, there might be a desperate chance for the
Panama route, which is free from all complications
arising in the Clayton- Buhver treaty.
France has no good feeling toward England just
now, and, on the general subject of an isthmian caiial,
has hoped that the United States would adopt the
Panama route and take that partly dug ditch off th;
hands of the French company.
AMERICANS will pay but little attention to the
comments of the Paris Figaro and other
French papers on the proceedings of the
American Senate on the Hay-Pauncefote canal treaty.
FRANCE AND THE CANAL.
SUGGESTION FOR UNION
OF MILK-WAGON DRIVERS
EDITOR OF THE CALL*â WH1 you kindly permit me, through the columns of
The Call, to bring the followjnsf matter to the attention of your readers â â¢specially
those who may be Interested In my suggestionâ to propose a movement to form an
organization of ml Ik- wagon drivers of ths city, which would give fraternal and social
advantages and privileges resulting in much good and great benefit to each and every
member.
The object of such an organization as I suggest should be to regulate wages,
shorten the hours of labor, wherever necessary, establish an employment bureau, pro
vide for the Eick and needyâ in short, to advance ar.d promote the welfare of each
number to mutual benefit and advantage.
The Initiation fee and monthly dues could be mad; so low that no obstacle be placed
In the way of all those desirous of Joining, thereby adding to strength and perma
nency.
Few there are. If any, who have not at one time or another felt the need of
organization. Long continued hours of labor with little rest make this occupation
one of the hardest, and thÂ«re are few who can withstand it for any great length
of time. In some instances the wages paid are nothing considering the time em
ployed.
If permission is kindly granted to use the columns of this paper to enable a few
of those Interested in this movement to be heard from on this subject and offer
such additional suggestions as may be proper here, we can get together and issue a
call for a meeting at an early date In order to dlscurs ways and means by which
it would lead to a permanent organization. Until others have been heard; from in
repard to this matter I shall defer further mention rntil later; but should be pleased.
If gjven support, at the proper time to tÂ£ke tho Initiative and see the thing
through successfully.

PERSONAL MENTION.
y^ ARTOONISTS of European papers vary In their conceptions of Uncle
fl^ Sam in a manner reminiscent of the blind men who felt of the ele
(l . phant and based their opinions of the brute's appearance according
to the feeling of the particular part of the elephant's body_of which
each laid hold.
It Is only since the commencement of the Chinese Imbroglio that the for
eign cartoonists have had an opportunity of giving Uncle Sam a part in
their humorous or satirical conceptions of the situation that confronts the na
tions that have marched troops Into China, The old gentleman's habit of
minding his own business and not mixing in the quarrels of other nations is
largely responsible for the proneness of the continental caricaturists to ignoro
the homely figure which custom has created to be emblematic of the great
Yankee nation.
â¢ -Just now It is different.. Many of the cartoonists on the other side of the
water are trying an apprentice hand at delineating Uncle Sam. All of the
caricaturists possess features in common, and yet they differ widely. Col
lectively they spring palpably from one parent stemâ the good, old-fa^hloned
Uncle Sam that was born yoars ngo from the pencil of native cartoonists and
has flourished perennially ever since. 3pangled breeches, stove-pipe hat, chin
whiskers, cowhide boots and all.
Each foreign picture maker, however, allows his own personality to have
sway In nddlngr to or taking from the caricature. These changes are plainly
colored by local habit. A. look n.t the half-dozen examples of Uncle Sam
as seen by alien eyes, reproduced from leading foreign papers, proves that.
To the notions of the German Klatteradatsch artist. Uncle Sam is a German.
Russian characteristics are visible in the offering of the St. Petersburg Stre
kosa artist. On the pages of the Italian Papapallo. ho is an Italian: -while
the man who does cartoons for Le Charivari of Paris has Infused a jaunty,
Frenchy air into his countenance and attire.
The feasibility of the enterprise being proven, and
its importance being universally recognized, it is to be
hoped Congress will no longer hesitate in providing
for it. It is to be regretted the British will have the
honor of taking the lead in crossing the Pacific with
a cable, but we can be a close successor and ought
not to delay in the work.
The surveys of which the President speaks, and
which, as he says, "have shown the entire feasibility
of a chain of cables which at each stopping-place,
shall touch on American soil," have brought to light
irany interesting facts concerning the ocean bed be
tween Hawaii and the Philippines. According to the
report of Rear Admiral Bradford, there is an almost
level plain of soft mud, of a nearly uniform depth of
2700 fathoms, extending from Honolulu to the Mid
way Islands, and another about 500 fathoms deeper
between the latter and Guam, broken by submarine
reefs and mountain ranges. From a scientific stand
point one of the most interesting discoveries made
was that of a submarine mountain range about 500
knots from Guam, which apparently connects with
the one which extends from the coast of Japan to the
Bonin Islands. To the north of this range, according
to the report, the bed of the ocean slopes gradually to
the eastward into the great Japanese Deep, which for
years held the record for ocean depths.
Such a cable will be costly and will not yield the
commercial profits that would have been gained by
touching at Hawaii, Samoa and New Caledonia. The
fact that the British have sacrificed those commer
cial opportunities for the sake of having complete con
trol of the line shows how much they value such con
trol. To the United States exclusive control of a cable
is a matter of as much importance as to the British,
and, accordingly, the construction of the British line
may well be included r.mong the circumstances which
emphasize the need of one to our Government.
According to the reports the British enterprise is
to cost about $8,975,000. It is to start from Van
couver and will touch no land except that controlled
by the empire. Consequently, instead of making a
landing station at Hawaii, the cable will go direct to
Fanning Island, making by far the greatest span
known to ocean cables. From that point it will pas^
by Samoa to Fiji, and from there be carried to the
Australian coast, thus leaving New Caledonia out of
the connection.
Although the President did not say so, it is prob
able that among the circumstances which to his mind
emphasize the need of the cable is the fact that the
British are about to lay one across the Pacific which
will be completely under their control. It has been
announced from London that the imperial Govern
ment and the Governments of the various colonie3
concerned have accepted the'offer of a British com
pany to lay such a cable, and the work will be under-
pNRESIDENT McKINLEY in recommending to
V â y Congress the prompt construction of a Pacific
cable line recalled the fact that he had made a
similar recommendation in a special message of Feb
ruary 10, 1899, and added: "Since then circum
stances have strikingly emphasized this need. Sur
veys have shown the entire feasibility of a chain ot
cables which at each stopping-place shall touch on
American territory, so that" the system shall be under
our own complete control."

CUBA'S CONSTITUTION.
That body has, however, been working diligently
and intelligently in forming a fundamental law for the
new republic. The only serious issue before it has ap
peared in fixing the qualifications for the Presidency.
Three instruments have been presented to the conven
tion, framed respectively by Senors Rivera, Morua
and Quesada. Rivera's plan follows closely the con
stitution of the United States. It creates a govern
ment of three co-ordinate branches, executive, legis
lative and judicial. The and members of
the House of Representatives are to be elected by
popular vote. The present provinces will be called
departments, conforming to our States, and each will
be divided into municipalities, conforming to our
counties. The municipalities Will elect their own local
officers, and at the same time will choose delegates to
the department Legislature. The Senators will be
chosen by this Legislature.
Rivera's constitution provides that the President of
the republic must be a native of Cuba. This is in-
tended to shut out General Gomez, who is a San Do
mingan. His partisans are represented in Morua's
plan, which differs from Rivera's in providing as the
only qualification for President that he served in th
revolution. Information as to this clause in Morua's
plan is defective, inasmuch as we are not informed
whether it provides that the President must be either
a native or an alien who took part in the revolution.
This would provide for the temporary issue made over
Gomez, and thereafter pass the Presidency down the
native line. No information is furnished as to the
length of the Presidential term. Senators are to re
ceive a salary of $1500 per year, and each department
is entitled to four Senators, and one representative for
each 30,^00 people, providing that when the popula
tion exceeds 15,000 it shall be entitled to one represen
tive.
All plans seem to combine in providing for pay
ment of the debt to the army and navy contracted by
the late provisional government. There seems some
doubt about the acceptance of this by the convention.
The situation is analogous to our own Revolutionary
expenses, which had been provided for by the issue
of Continental money, which was never redeemed
after the adoption of our constitution in 1789. In
; deed, we are not aware that any such revolutionary
j debt has ever been paid, though there may be in
1 stances.
The fight of the Gomez party for Morua's plan is
described as "red hot," and if successful the San Do
mingan will probably be the first President. Other-
I wise a native Cuban, probably Rivera or Quesada, will
be chosen.
It seems to be understood that Bishop Sbarretti is
leading the anti-Gomez forces, and it is said that
Gomez has demanded of General Wood the removal
of the Bishop. It is riifticult to see how the military
authorities of the United States can separate a Bi?hop
from his see, but the request exhibits an element of
religious rancor in the Cuban situation. Under the
circumstances the Bishop would better abstain from
politics and leave the building of a civil government
to laymen. It bodes no good to the future of Cuba
tc mix a religious feud in the foundations of the
government.
All of the plans recognize religious toleration. They
: are at present in the hands of the sections of the
' central committee of the convention for stud}', and it
j ir hoped to have the perfected instrument ready for
1 reference to the present session of our Congress.
This reference becomes necessary under the terms
] and conditions of our declaration of war against
â¢ Spain. It is a novel event in our history that the con
; stitution of another republic is referred to our Gov
. ernment for ratification and indorsement. Under the
I plan it may be left for our Congress to decide upon
: the qualifications of the President of Cuba, and the
'red-hot fight over Gomez may. be transferred from
I Havana to Washington. It would appear at this di->
I tance that the Morua plan of limiting the Presidency
j to a native or a revolutionist will be the safer to
i adopt, considering the future peace of the island.
Gomez is a heroic figure in Cuba, and, if shut out by
the constitution, ill feeling will smolder to an extent
I threatening the peace and prosperity of the people.
It is the rule among men that the conqueror either
i becomes the ruler or establishes a line of rulers.

COMMERCE OF THE NATIONS.
| â * XPERTS of the Bureau of Statistics of the
Treasury Department have been for some time
! * * .past engaged in preparing a statistical abstract
showing the imports and exports of every country in
| the world having statistical records. The object of
! the abstract is to present in a single volume an ac
| count of the world's commerce, not only of to-day,
| but extending back over a long series of years, with
! details concerning t*ie principal articles of trade,
! country by country, with quantities and values ex
| pressed in our measurements and currency,
i The opening chapter of the work has been com
| pleted and in itself contains a large amount of valu
â¢ able information affording material for interesting-
I comparisons between the commerce of our own coun
; try and that of other nations. The imports for home
j consumption of the United Kingdom, for instance,
J which in the year 1800 amounted to $81,310,000,
! amounted in 1899 to $2,043,896,450, an increase of 2400
; per cent; while in the case of the United States the
; imports for home consumption in 1800 were $52,121,
j 891, and in 1899 $685,441,892, an- increase of 1215 per
; cent. Taking the export side the contrast is much
: more clearly in favor of the United States. The ex*
j ports of articles of home production from the
I United Kingdom in 1800 were $111,107,000, and in
I 1899 $1,287,151,345, an increase of 1059 per cent; in the
i case of the United States the exports of home
; products in 1800 were $31,840,903, and in 1899
j $1,203,931,222, an increase of 3681 per cent.
One of the most interesting features of this opening
chapter is the showing made of the relation of imports
I to exports in the various countries. The records 01
i forty-seven countries other than the United States are
! given in the tables, and from these it appears that
i eighteen countries show an excess of exports over im
j ports and twenty-nine show an excess of imports over
exports. Virtually all European countries; except
Russia, Am 1a and Spair^, show an excess of imports
over export?. In the other leading countries of the
world, with the exception of China and Japan, tjie
exports are in excess of imports.
A comparison of these figures shows in a ttriking
manner the pre-eminence of the United States in the
commercial world. Among the eighteen countrie*
whose exports exceed their imports are such great
populations as those of Russia, India, Austria, Spain,

When a railroad provides watchmen to
guard employes from danger while at
work under or around a car. it perrorms
its whole duty and is not liable for an ac
cident caused by the negligence of the.
watchman in Jiot giving proper warning
to the workmen thus engaged. In a case
in Wisconsin where this rule was applied,
it was shown that there were three train
men standing by a car when the accident
happened to a man who was working un
derneath; and. furthermore, that "it was
the duty of each of them" as an incident
to his employment to act as a watchman
to protect his coemploye. The court re
marked that it was true there were no
â¢written or published regulations of the
company showing that they must thus
Watchmen to Guard Employes.
This principle that an employer must
make and promulgate rules, which, if
faithfully followed, will give reasonable
protection to his employes. Is a very gen
eral one; indeed, it prevails in every State.
Ar.d perhaps the rule is almost as well
known that rules adopted by the employes
that are not regularly put forth by their
employerâ which, therefore, they are not
required to obey â will not excuse the com
pany from doing Its duty.
Rules Made \yy Employes.
In Berrigan's case against the Erie Rail
road an employe of the- company was in
jured while coupling cars and died from
the injury. In the suit against the com
pany it was claimed that it had failed to
make and publish sufficient regulations
for the guidance of its empiaj' es while
coupling cars. The court in- considering
this claim remarked that it was easy
enough after an accident had occurred to
suggest how it might have been prevent
ed. The company was only bound to usÂ»e
ordinary care in formulating rules, and it
was not reasonable to proceed on the as
sumption that every injury to an employe
could be prevented by making such rules.
It was the duty of the company to anti
cipate and guard by rules or otherwise
against only such accidents as might rea
sonably be foreseen by the company.
There was no proof that rules for such a
case had ever been promulgated by any
other railroad, or that it was reasonable
or practicable to provide against the oc
currence of such an accident by a rule.
The question whether the company v.-as
at fault in omitting to make and publish
such a rule was left to the jury- "This."
remarked the Court of Appeals, "opened
to the jury a wide field for speculation
and conjecture. In the absence of some
proof on the part of the person who sued
the company that such a rule was in
operation by other roads. â¢ â¢ ? or
unless the necessity and propriety of mak
ing and promulgating such a rule was so
obvious as to make the question one of
common experience and knowledge, the
court is not warranted in submitting such
a question to the Jury." The court fur
ther thought that the rules in use pro
vided a reasonable way against the oc
currence of such an accident and conse
quently there was no case to present to
the Jury.
Berrigan vs. Erie Railroad.
In the case of Abel against the Dela
ware and Hudson Railroad, a car repairer
In the railroad's employ was under one of
Its cars making repairs. The car was
Btandlng on a sidetrack. Another car was
carelessly backed against it by other em
ployes BJid caused his death. In action
brought against the company by tho
man's wife to recover money for the loss
of her husband it was shown that other
railroad companies had adopted a rule for
g lacing a blu* flag by day and a blue light
y night on a car under which repair men
were at work and prohibiting the coup
ling or moving of a car thus protected
until the signal was removed by the re
pair men. Such a ruie had not been
adopted by the company. The court re
marked that this was a very proper rule,
and if employes were faithful in carrying
it out it would give reasonable protection
to rJpair men. The court held that
whether Buch a rule ought to have been
adopted by the company above mentioned
was a question for the jury to decide.
Repairing Cars.
Under the first head may be mentioned
the case of Morgan against the Hudson
River Ore Company. The company had
ten kilns for roasting ore standing in a
row about ten feet apart. They stood on
a slight decline, and a narrow-gauge rail
road track ran along by the side of the
kilns, upon which cars loaded with ore
were moved by horsepower. One day th<?
finger of an employe was caueht in one
of the wheels of a cur and crushed.
There were no written or printed rules
for conducting the business, though it
was proved that the superintendent had
given some oral instructions with respect
to doing the work. It was contended that
a set of rules ought to have been made
for conducting the business, and that if
this had been done the accident would not
have happened. The court thought other
wise. "There was nothing in the nature
of the business," said the court, "that
made it necessary for the" company to
make and publish rules. The business
had been conducted in the same way for
years before and no 'accident had hap
pened, and none could reasonably be ap
prehended or anticipated. Even if it
could be shown after the accident occur
red that it might have been prevented by
adopting and enforcing some suitable
rule, that would constitute no proper test
of liability. The failure to adopt rules is
not proof of negligence, unless it appears
from the nature of the business in which
the servant is engaged that the master, in
the exercise of reasonable care, should
have foreseen and anticipated the neces
sity of such precautions."
When Is a Rule Necessary?
We start out then with the simple and
reasonable rule that an employer must
make proper rules and t?ive them due pub
licity. This rule, however, at once holds
within Itself the following questions: In
what cases are any rules or regulations
whatever required for the safety of em
ployes? for surely they are not required
in all. Again, in what cases are the cxÂ«
lstlng rules proper and suitable?
In view or the wanderings of ths? courts
in trying to answer the question who are
fellow-servants, we are not convinced by
the learned judge of judicial infallibility.
It is true, that the tinal court in a State
may make a rule which other courts in
that State must follow, but the final court
might go as far astray in doing this as
a jury. Surely all of those who are floun
dering in the hopeless sea of decialons on
the question of fellow-service cannot bo
righjâ nay, some of them must be clearly
and entirely wrong. And indeed on the
question immediately before us their dif
ferences are so ?reat that the prospect or
"eventual uniformity," hopefully predict
ed by Justice Strong, seems to us darkly
remote.
Judicial "Wanderings.
Â¦â¢There are strung reasons," says Mr.
Justice Strong, "why the reasonableness
of railroad regulations should in tne ab
sence cf any pcsltlve proof as to their ef
fect be submitted to tne court as a ques
tion of law, rather than to the jury as
cne of fact. Ordinarily Jurors are not
aware of all the reasons calling for the
rule. They arc apt to listen readily to
any allegations ot injuries on railways.
Wnat ope Jury might deem an incon
venient rule another might approve as
judicious and proper, 'mere would be
no uniformity. Ordinarily the managers
of railways are much better qualined than
Jurors to ascertain and weign the exigen
cies which call for^any rule, and, if it
should be productive of some inconveni

Whether an employer ought to make a
particular rule or set of rules in most
states is a Question lor the acclsion of
the court and not of the Jury; in other
words. It is a question of law and not a
question of fact. fcÂ»o also is tho question
wnether a rule 13 reasonable or not.
Not every business requires rules to be
made for the guidance of employes. But
when the business is large and complex,
like that of railroads, lactorif-s, mlr.es
and the like, in which targe nuninÂ«rs are
employed, then the auty 01 making such

What is an employer'3 duty In the way
of giving instrucf.ons to his employes?
To answer this question fully our Inquiry
may be divided Into three branches The
firat of these relates to his duty to make
end set forth rules and regulations for the
better working of his machinery, appli
ances or enterprise, and also for the
greater safety of his employes. Many of
these rules, as we shall Boon learn, are
prepared more especially for the benefit of
youthful and inxperlenced persona.

University of Pennsylvania.
An Illinois Case.
A case has arisen In Illinois of a switch
man who on a dark night was struck, by
a car and killed wh;ie attempting to
reach a switch in obedience to a signal.
It appeared, that the switch was danger
ous and that the company had adopted
no rules with respect to switching. Tho
switch was known &s a "flying switch,"
some of the cars also had defective
brakes and there was no light on the
front car, though it was usual to put ono
there on dark nights. One of the wit
nesses for the company testified that he
never saw any rules about flying switches
and did not think any one else had. Yet
he also said Immediately afterward that
three whistles wtre used as a signal for
the switch. "By this," said the court,
"we understand It was by fore* of a pre
scribed rule these signals werÂ» made. Im
portant to be made, certainly, and so Im
portant that a railroad company would
te Justly charged with negligence in not
prescribing anct enforcing them. It Is per
fectly feasible to prescribe definite rules
for making flying switches, though they
may be seldom made."
These are a few of the many answers
to the question. In what cases should
rules or regulations be made for conduct-
Ing a business more safely? The other
question, whether the rule in a given case
is a reasonable one or not, can evidently
be answered only when it arises. A larga
number of cases have happened which
turned on the answer to this question.
Were the rules existing for governing: em
ployes reasonable or sufficient? This, as
we have said, is In most States a question
of law for the court to decide. In one of
the cases, relating to a railroad. It was
held that a rule which merely stated
"Blue is a signal to be used by car In
spectors" was not sufficiently definite.
In another case a rule required car con
ductors to look after switches when used
by their engineer. This was held to be a
sufficient rule, consequently the company
was not liable for the death of a con
ductor who was killed through the neglect
cf another who knew the rule but neglect
ed to adjust a switch properly.
ALBERT S. BOLLES.
An accident happened to a railroad em
ploye in Kansas, who was injured while
attempting to couple cars from a de
tached car. The company had no estab
lished rukÂ» or custom for notifying or
warning' s'j^chmfn wnrkiner In the com
pany's yard of the movinpr of detarhpd
cars, cxcjit that thÂ«Â» boll of an engine
should be kf? A t rlrsr'ns while it was in mo
tirn. The employe claimed that the com
pany was miilisfnt in not having: some
regulatien about the movinp of such cars.
Tho Supreme Court decided that a Jury
was not justified in finding that such a
regulation would be feasible or useful.
An important case of this kind has b**en
decided by the Supreme Court of Missouri.
A boy seventeen year3 old wag employed
in carrying water to a gansr of men who
were repairing the roadbed, and in look
ing after the tools. He. with the fore
man and other laborers, traveled In a ca
boose car attached to a fretsht train.
They alighted at a place and left the train
standing on the main track. The fore
man, with the boy. went a short distance
along- the track, and then the boy was
sent back to the. caboose to notify the la
borers about their work and assist them
in getting out their tools. After doing
this. Just a? he was leaving: the car other
cars were shoved suddenly against It, he
was knocked -off and the caboose ran over
h!s arm and leg, badly injuring him. The
cars were moved by the engineer arut
brakeman. "by the maneuver known as
'kicking-.' " As the engineer and brake
man were fellow-servants with the boy â
all working in the same service â he could
not recover for their negligence, however
great: hi? only chance was to show that
the company was negligent "In falling and
omitting to provide any rules or regula
tions or system" in such cases. The lower
court rendered a verdict in favor of the
company, but the Court of Review re
garded the matter differently, remarking
that one who employs servants In a com
plex and dangerous r.uslness ought to pre
scribe proper rule3 for conducting It safe
ly. The railroad contended that In Joln
injr cars, especially in the case of freight
trains. It did not Involve any unusual risk.
"We do not," said the court, "agree to the
proposition. Tt is certainly a complex
business requiring care, and must be dan
gerous, if not done under proper regula
tions, at least to far as other servants
are concerned, whose business requires
them to be in and out of the cars, liable
to be jolted. In the case of shunting or
kicking cars, it is feasible and perfectly
proper to have some rules and regulations
to warn persons liable to be Injured, and
c^ses are not wanting where railroad
companies have been held liable to ser
vants for injuries? received in consequence
of a vrant of such regulations for tho
guidance of the servants In performing
these maneuvers."

such witnesses testified that their duty in

AHEEST ON BELGIAN KING.
Three Chinese Locked Up in the Har
bor Police Station.
Ah Bo, a waiter on the United States
transport Belgian King, will have to an
swer to a charge of grand larceny. When
the steamship reached port Dr. -R. Colt
man reported that he had lost S1S5 in
greenbacks. Three Chinese, who fre
quently entered his quarters, were suspect
ed, but there was no proof against them.
Finally when Detective Egan found the
men trying to leave the ship he placed
them under arrest. When searched at the
police station $175 in greenbacks was found
sewed into the lining of Ah Bo's clothes.
When taxed with the theft he admitted
having found the monev in Dr. Coltman's
room and said the missing $10 he had paid
to the chief steward on account of a debt.
Ah Bo's confession cleared 1 the other Chi
r.ese and they were released. Ah Bo was
then charged with grand larceny.
Sealing Schooner Seizsd.
The Russian barkentine Bering arrh'ed
here from Petropaulofsky yesterday. She
comes here in ballast and will take back
to Vladivostok a full cargo of flour, salt
and general merchandise. 1 The Bering
brings the news that two Japanese sealing
schooners and ono American vessel were
seized In Bering Sea for poaching on Cop
per Island. All three vessels were de
tained in Vladivostok and the crews were
at Saghallon when the Bering left for San
Francisco. These are probably the same,
vessels reported from Yokohama as hav
ing been captured.
Â» FTER taking a year, all but nine
i\ days, to round the Horn, the
ZA\ French bark Eugenia Fautrel
finally made i>ort yesterday.
This is her maiden voyage and
on this year's venture the owners will
have to face a dead loss. A defective rud
der caused all the trouble and to it the
captain lays the blame of a six months'
detention at Buenos Ayres.
The Eugenia Fautrel left Swansea ex
actly 256 days ago. On January 23 sho
was in latitude 11 scuth. longituae 3s west.
On March TJ sne was in ijuenos Ayres
with her rudder broken and otherwise
aaniaged. The ve^el was Duilt under the
new French subsidy law and as the own
ers wanted her in a hurry she was built
under "rush orders." She is a handsome
looKingr craft, but when the test came In
a pampero off. the River Platte she was
not equal to the occasion. When the
storm was over the Eugenia Fautrel was
almost helpless. Her steering gear was
disabled and the rudder broken nearly in
two. During- the calm that followed the
storm a jury steering gear and rudder
were fixed up and the bark finally reached
Buenos Ayres.
An soon as port was reached the real
trouble began. The vessel was surveyed
and on April 2 orders were sent to France
for a new rudder. It was nearly five
months before the necessary articles ar
rived and it was September 19 before the
Eugenia Fautrel was ready to sail again.
After getting away from Buenos Ayres
she ran Into a succession of calms, so the
captaln put into Montevideo In the hope
of picking up some men as the vessel was
snort-handed, five of the crew having de
serted while at Buenos Ayres.
At Montevideo they found the British
bark Mistley Hall. She had been in a
hurricane and was completely dismasted.
Her decks were swept and three of the
sailors had lost their lives. Two of them
were blown from the yard nrm into the
sea and one fell from aloft and was In
stantly killed. The Mistley Hall was such
a. wreck that the owners decided to sell
her. The crew wanted to get home, so
live of tlvrn shipped on the Frenchman.
All of them are now anxious to get ashore
and the chances are that by this morning
the bark will be minus five of her crew.
Since the Mistley Hall disaster was re
ported the bark Auldgerth has been to
Montevideo and taken aboard her cargo.
The latter vessel Is now fifty days out
on her return to San Francisco with the
Mistley Hall's cargo, while the remains
of the latter vessel have been sold to an
Italian firm.

CHICAGO, Dec. 11.â During the forenoon the

unchanged to Ho higher at 73@73ttc and sold
during the first hour to 73Vic. A fractional
recession from this point followed, but later
New York reported fifty-three loads taken for
export, ten of them" from Chicago, and Brad

croare of 2,1S4,OOO bushels, all of which In

The following are the seasonal rainfalls to
date, as compared with those of the same date

four hrmrs:
Weather Report.
"Oraiures have matured rapidly In Southern
California, but In oth^r sections their develop
ment has been retarded by cool weather and
fogs. Prospects continue good for an unusually
large crop In most sections. Olives have
ripened rather slowly, but will yield a larger
Crop than average. The high temperature pre
vailing in Southern California is causing fruit
fcufis to swell and there Is said to be some
apprehension cf damage to next season's crop
ehould the preeent conditions continue. Cooler
weather anf rain would be very beneficial In
that section."
"Early eown gr&in haÂ« made good growth
Jn all sections during the week and i* looking
strong. Alfalfa is in pplendid condition. Green
feed is becoming plentiful In all parts of the
Etate and Ftock is in good condition.
â¢'Abnormally lew temperatures, accompanied
by heavy fogs, have prevailed In the great
i alleys and in the co&Et ar.d bay sections
during the week, while in Southern California
the weather has beÂ»n generally clear aiÂ»d the
tr-mperature above normal. Frosts have oc
curred in the foothill and mountain districts
end occasional light frosts in other sections,
but no darr-ape has been done, except In re
tarding the growth of green feed. The dense
fege have prevented too rapid evaporation and
the eoll continues in excellent condition for
rarer, work. Farmers in all sections have made
frÂ»Et progress in plowing and seeding. The
outlook for heavy crops wa6 never better at
this dat<? and farmers are cowing an unusually
larpe acreage of graia in anticipation of a
very profperous season.
A. G. McAdie, Â«ection director of the climate
and crep ten-lee of the weather bureau, makes
the following report for the week:
Weather and Crop Bulletin.
"Brazil nuts show increased strength, owing
to the crowing scarcity. Marbot walnuts are
still practically off the market. Grenobles are

fair quality. Sicily and Valencia shelled al

"Cuirants are easy, with fair demand.

tdjustment of anthracite affairs Involved in
the abandonment of this plan would be of great
tapcrtance. as was plainly shown by the buoy
ancy of all the stocks in the group. No author
itative confirmation could be had of the re
ports current, but the record of the tape was
Btrongly confirmatory, the gains In the group
running from 1 to 3 points. There was some
demand from London on account of the open-
Ing cf a new account Incident to the settle
ment, but this buying is called professional
arbitrage operation and may originate either
in New York or in London. The most marked
effect was produced on Southern Pacific, which
opened up 1U and advanced later to 43, clos
ing at the highest. The belief has prevailed
in 'Wall street that there was . a very heavy
ehort account in some of the railroad stocks
for which Western speculators were liable,
the Epeculation extending also Into the steel
stocks. The bear account In the latter troup
has been aimed at by the advance this weÂ«k
and may have been reached In the railroad
group this afternoon.
The money market outlook continued threat
ening, so that the supposition is aroused that
to-day's buying is for the account of financial
interests which are independent of the' ordi
nary resources of the money market. The sub
treasury has already taken from the market
this week the sum of $2,2OS,O00. so that the
Inroad on the resources of the banks promises
to be as great this week as lt was last week.
The London money market was not affected
to-day by yesterday's sharp drop in the ster
ling exchange here and exchange rates fell
a further fraction. This may foreshadow an
acquiescence in the New York demand for gold.
The ehlpment from India to London of $2,500,
000 in gold in payment for silver may be in
tercepted and diverted to the New York mar
ket, as was done with the last similar ship
ment. but Its arrival in New York would be
too remote to affect the present situation, even
if lt were ascertained. Whatever the motive,
the strength in stocks was well maintained to
the close, except in the steel group.
The bond market was irregular. Total sales
per value. $4,045,000.

NEW YORK, Dec. 11.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were rather more active to
day and there was a better tendency, although
theÂ»-e is beginning to be talk of more Govern
ment borrowing for Transvaal expenditures,
which are so excessive that they cannot be
covered by temporary expedients, but demand
a big issue of consols. This, however, is
simply popular surmise. Americans formed an
excellent market, the London contingent buy-
Ing steadily, while New York strongly sup
ported the market. Eries continued to lead,
the Morgans buying freely. Northern Pacifies
and St. Paul were scarce. Anacondas rallied.
Money rates were unchanged. Silver was firm
on French tenders for S0.000 kilos.

Boston Wool Market.
NEW YORK, Dec. 11.â The cotton market
opened at an advance of i@" points and mo
mentarily ruled firm on less of a break at
Liverpool than had been expected. Selling
soon became quite general and the market sold
off 17026. points from the top prices, after
which there was a feeble rally on covering and
pront-taking. The close was steady and un
changed to 8 points lower.
Nczu York Cotton Market.
NEW YORK. Dec. 11.â The general market
for metals vai again extremely quiet, though
tin broke heavily at London as the result of
the bearish statistical position both In this
country and abroad. The close at London was
quoted at Â£110 10s. Locally tin was
weak and somewhat lower on bid prices, clos
ing wltb/sellers at $27028. Spelter ruled rather
quiet, but about steudy at nominally un
changed prices here and In London, $4 22*4Â®
4 27V4 and Â£1S 15s. respectively. Lead was dull
and nominally quoted at $4 37%. while lake
copper, though unchanged,' displayed an easy
undertone, following unsatisfactory advices
from abroad and closed easy at $17 for Lake
Superior and $16 62V4 for casting. Domestio
iron markets ruled dull and nominally un
changed despite firmer English markets, where
Glasgow closed firm at 62s Sd and Mlddlesboro.

i Harrison's circular eaya: "Since th* Marl
posa left the following coal-laden vessels havÂ«
arrived from Australia, viz.: Invercoe, 230O
tons; Drumburton. 2363; Thistlebank, 3870;
total. S933 tons. Since the Newcastle product
has lost its local prestige here, on account of
the shrinkage in Its shipments and its high cost
delivered here, in all contracts now made for
future fuel by our large consumers colonial coal
is entirely eliminated. Of course there will
bo a limited demand annually for Newcastle
coal, as it is preferred by some to the northern
fuel, even at enhanced prloes, although the
present existing difference is large. The local
call for coal at Newcastle and Sydney Is now
so brisk that but Hula attention Is given to
this market, as the product of the principal
cclllerles Is sold into the middle of 190L Brit
ish Columbia and Washington are keeping us
gtnerously supplied, so that there will be no
danger of a scarcity this winter of either steam
or domestic grades. There is a marked dlffer
erce In the asking prices of these, as the pro
ducers of the best qualities of house fuel are
limited in numbers and they do not overload
the market with their output, hence values are
well sustained. Next year crude oil will be
delivered here in large quantities and compe
tition will be so sharp that low figures must
prevail. Where fuel figures largely in the
idonthly expenses of some of our factories oil
will necessarily come to their rescue and will
cause the reopening of a large number of
others."

Local coal men say that other San Fran
cisco dealers have been making similar
endeavors to increase their coal receipts.
Washington coal mines are now producing
more coal than ever before. Old mines
are furnishing their maximum output and
new properties are being opened. Local
railroads, factories and steamers are tak
ing double the quantity of coal they used
three years ago. Besides this, the enor
mous demand from Alaska and the Ha
waiian Islands is now being supplied here.
All the coal used by the northern rail
roads west of Montana comes from. Puget
Sound mines. Considering these facts,

TACOMA, Dec 11.â Coal prices In Saa
Francisco will be advanced again soon,
according to a statement made here to
day by C. B. Fan-ell, a coal dealer of
that city. He came north several days
ago to ascertain if the mines could not
furnish more coal for immediate ship
ment, recent receipts at San Francisco
having been shorter than usual. He finds
that the mines now have all the orders
they canjKÂ»Esibly take carÂ© of, and that
even if more coal were available there are
not enough ships and steamers in sight to
carry it to California. On these facts ha
bases his statement that another price
advance Is likely to follow on both steam
and domestic coals.
ADVANCE PROBABLE
IN PRICE OF COAL
The Foreign Minister explained that he
was not aware that fresh complaints
against Herr Pott were the cause of this,
but a notification sent to The Netherlands
Minister of the withdrawal of the exequa
tur would illy- accord with the- very
friendly relations between The Nether
lands and Portugal. Immediately after
the exequatur was withdrawn, however,
the Dutch Minister was summoned to
give Information . and Herr Pott was ex
pected at The Hague within a month.
The Government of The Netherlands
supposed that Portugal approved of this
proposal, and was surprised to learn
shortly afterward that Portugal insisted
on withdrawing the exequatur of Herr
Pott.
THE HAGUE, J3ec 11.â Replying in the
Second Chamber to-day to the Interpella
tion of Count von Bylandt. notice bf
which was given yesterday, on the sub
ject of the tension betwen The Nether
lands and Portugal, the Foreign Min
ister. Dr. W. IL de Beaufort, sketched
the history of tho misunderstanding-,
which, he declared, had been exaggerated.
He said the Dutch Minister at Lisbon,
Baron von Heekeren, announced on No
vember 17 that Portugal desired to with
draw the exequatur of Herr Pott as Con
sul of The Netherlands at Lourenzo Mar
ques, unless the Government of The
Netherlands would obviate the necessity
by dismissing or recalling Herr Pott. As
The Netherlands Government had no of
ficial information that Herr Pott had per
mitted, as alleged, the importation of
contraband of war, it would not accede to
the demand for his recall without a fuller
inquiry and it therefore instructed the
Minister at Lisbon to cable to Herr Pott
asking him to clear up the matter. Herr
Pott then applied for leave to come to Eu
rope, which was granted him. and The
Netherlands proposed to Portugal that an
Investigation be made during the Consul's
visit and that three months be allowed
for the rendering of a report on the sub
ject.
Netherlands and Portugal.
Explanation of Dispute Between the
HOW THE QUARREL STARTED.
The decoration of the grave of the late
Governor Goebel took place in the after
noon.
Governor Beckham in his inaugural ad
dress did not refer to the murder of Wil
liam Goebel. He promised the State a
clean ad honest administration of its ex
ecutive affairs in a spirit of fairness and
tolerance, with no feeling: of partisan hate
or malice, with the sincere desire to re
move as far as possible all friction and
Ill-feeling from among the people. He
said it would be his policy to keep the
S\ate Guard in a first-class condition, but
that the military power should always be
in absolute subordination to the civil au
thority and should never be called into
active service except as a last resort to
carrying out the decrees of judicial tri
bunals.
The booming of cannon at 11 o'clock was
the signal for the inaugural procession to
take up its march.. Two regiments of the
State Guard, the Duckworth Club of Cin
cinnati, and many political clubs and
civic societies were in line. It was about
noon when the : procession reached the
capltol. *
The oath of office was administered to
the Governor by Chief Justice Hazelrigg.
After the ceremonies at the inaugural
stand the Governor reviewed the State
troops.

CHICAGO. Dec. 11,-The Hannah Grif
fea Benevolent and Christian Home for
Colored Children, at one time one of the
best known and most highly commendea
charitable institutions in Chicago, to-day
Iffnoininiously passed out of existence,
when tne officers, guided by Miss Sucan
Clark, probation officer of the Juvenile
court, forcibly took sixteen children from
ihe mlsernble building where the home
was last located. The children were left
tmcared for in a shamy. all half-clothed,
several e!ck and ihrte cufterirg from dis
ease cr deformed.
The building 'in which they lived is a
small one-etory shanty, which is divided
vy a board partition into two rooms.
J -either one of which is more than ten
ry fifteen feet in size. In these two rooms
J:ved Mrs. Hannah Griffon and sixteen
cnilGren. One of tiic rooms was evi
aently used for a sleeping apartment. In
It ejc iron beds were crowded. Blankets
Â¦were also spread in one corner to help
out accommodations. In tlie other room
Â¦was a large cast iron heater, such as is
Feen in rural railroad stations.
when the officers entered the room this
Ftove was heated red hot. making the at
mosphere stirting. There was imminent
danper that the children would be burned
in playing about it. This room was also
furnished with. a table, several broken
chairs and a cradle, in which a feeble
minded child was lyinp, seemingly in a
stupor. On tho floor were scattered re
mains of toys, scraps, raw vegetables.
Wishes, and over everything a thick cover
ing of dirt.
The children had evidently been at
tempting to cook Fome sort of a meal.
In one of th<Â» tin pans on the table three
cnior.s were floating in some murky wa
ter, riesitie the (Ki-ii was half of a large
raw rutabaga and several potatoes, none
of which had been cooked. The only oth
â¢ r article? of food in the house were two
leaves of stale bread. The children said
they had eaten nothing for two days.

New President of Southern
Pacific Is Due Here
Christmas.
Proposition to Discontinue Issuing of
Passes to Employes Discussed
at Meeting of Presi-
V-.- dents.
Charles M. Hays, the new president of
the Southern Pacific, is to accompany
"Vice President J. C. Stubbs when he re
turns to this city from the East the lattei
part of the month. At least that is the
understanding among the officials of the
company here. H. E. Huntlngton may
also return at the same time. He is now
In New York, where he went last week,
ostensibly to dispose of the Huntingdon
estate"s Southern Padnc shares. Mr.
Stubbs is now in Washington with W.
F. Hcrrin attending a meeting of the In
terstate Commerce Commission, which is
to pass upon the case of the St. Louis
Merchnnts' Acsociation against the South
trn Pacific and Santa Fe roads.
Both Mr. Stubbs and Mr. Hays were
present at a meeting of the Western rail
way presidents in New York last week,
and Mr. Stubbs met the Southern Pacific's
new president on that occasion for the
tlrst time. At this meeting a proposition
to discontinue the practice of Issuing
passes to employes of railroad lines wa3
discussed and a special committee was ap
pointed to tÂ»ke the matter up with all
the Eastern and Southern lines and re
port some plan of action for the year 1902.
In the opinion of the conference so radical
a change in old customs as is proposed
cannot De made in less than a year.

NO CERTIFICATE
FOR NEW THEATER
Playhouse.
One for Central Park
Board of Works Will Refuse
Supervisors Hay Rescind Ordinance
Which Does Not Include Priv
ilege of Using Building for
Theatrical Purposes.
In all probability the promoters of the
new Central Park Theater venture win be
unable to open the doors of their play
house to the public. While the Board of
Public Works has as yet taken no official
action. Commissioner Manson intimated
yesterday that a certificate of proper con
struction would not be forthcoming. The
Tax Collector will refuse to issue a license
on that score.
The attention of the Board of Super
visors has been called to these facts by
Mayor Phelan and as a result the Ju
diciary Committee will on next Friday
consider the rescinding of the resolution
granting the privilege of altering and
erecting additions to the old panorama
building on Market street, near Eighth.
One point that may result In the rescind
ing of the permit is that the resolution
does not grant the privilege of using the
altered building for theatrical purposes,
but for amusement purposes only. The
ordinance merely says:
Resolved, That the Central ParJc Amusement
Company be and Is hereby granted permission
to build in Central Park, corner Eighth and
Market streets, a gravity railway; also to con
struct and maintain a temporary butldlnS of
Iron, with wooden frame, adjoining rear of
present Iron covered bulltilnir, in said park; the
whole to be used for amusement purposes, and
the privilege to continue at the pleasure of the
board.
Commissioner Manson says that the
resolution was passed In July, or Just one
month after the passage of the ordinance
regulating the construction and mainte
nance of theaters. He says that the reso
lution allowing the alterations to the
building was passed by the Supervisors In
direct conflict with the theater ordinance.
When the attention of the board was
called to thf fact that the building was
being reconstructed in violation of the fire
ordinance, it decirt/nl that the permit
could not be rescinded. It held that It
was the duty of tne Fire E>epartment to
see that the alterations were made ac
cording to law. Fire Chief Sullivan con
tended that under the charter the rÂ«rpon
plbility did not lie with his department
and declined to accept it. The Board of
Public Works also refused to take any
action until an application was made by
the Central Theater proprietors for a cer
tificate. The Board of Works will hold.
Manson says, that the covering of gal
vanized iron on wooden partitions is rn
conflict with both the theater and nre
ordinances and a certificate will be re
fused. Before that happens, however.
Manson hopes that the Supervisors will
crawl out of their dilemma In having Ille
gally granted the privilege by rescinding
the resolution on the subject.
JOHN EABDEB WAS
PROBABLY MTTRDERED
Mutilated Body of the Seattle Man
Found Near the Ocean
Dock.
SEATTLE. Dec. 11.â The mystery sur-
rounding the strange disappearance of
John Harder, who was last seen alive
Tuesday tight, November 19, was solved
to-day by the finding of his body In the
bay near the ocean dock. Every appear
ance points to Harder having been mur
dered. On his head were several wounds,
probably made by a blunt instrument
from behind. The trousers pockets were
turned lrside out. showing that he had
been robbed.
What lends further color to the murder
theory is the fact that Harder was seen
early In the morning after leaving hl3
work, at a txÂ»er hall on Second street, in
company with a strange man, who said
he came from Montana.

pin which he produced. Hoff gave an eva
sive answer.
The -prosecution will close its side of
the case by noon to-day.
COUPLING PIN
IS IN EVIDENCE
"PleasÂ«d to Meet You," Says
Seymour When Ha First
Meets Hoff.
The afternoon session of the Hoff case
yesterday was replete with both dramatic
and humorous situations. Captain of De
tectives Seymour was on the stand and
told of his search for Hoff the day after
the Clute murder and how he eventually
found him in Captain Lees* office in the
City Hall and was formally introduced to
him. After the presentation Seymour says
that he said to Hoff, "I ant pleased to
meet you. Mr. Hoff." There was a ripple
of laughter in the courtroom when Sey
mour made this admission, and nobody
doubted that he was glad to meet Hoff
after a twenty-four hour fruitless search
for the much-wanted man.
The dramatic feature of the day was
when Dr. E. Bunnell was on the stand.
He grasped the coupling pin firmly In hla
hand and showed the jury how a terrible
blow could be inflicted with the weapon
and how it might leave a wound in the
hand of the person who held it.
Â¦ Yesterday morning the first witness was
Police Officer Feeney. Ho concluded his
testimony. of the day before. He waa fol
lowed by Sergeant of Police H. H. Colby,
who stated that Hoff appeared at police
headquarters, on the | morning, after the
murder about 8 o'clock. He asked for the
Chief of Police, and said that he was tho
carpet layer that: they were looking for
and that his name was Hoff. Colby sent
for the official stenographer and Captain
Seymour.. Hoff then made a statement to
the latter officer, which was taken down
In shorthand. *\*. '-'Â¦
Otto Heyneman, the official stenogra
pher, was the next witness. . Attorney
Schooler, for the defense, strenuously ob
jected to his -statement being admitted in
evidence, as it was down in shorthand.
Judge: Cook ruled that the witness could
not read the statement off verbatim, but
that he might look at the pages and re
fresh his memory. Heyneman's statement
was similar to that of Chief Lees.
In the afternoon -W. B. jjxeger, owner of
the house at 803 Guerrero street, explained
to the Jury, the alterations that had been
made in the residence since the murder
and L. F. Terkerson, a photographer em

â¢Dr. E; Bunnell, who Was assistant sur
geon at the time of the murder, swore
that he examined Hoffs hand on Decem
ber 16, 1897. Hoff told him that he hurt it
by picking up a plank with a nail in it.
The next day the surgeon again exam
ined the wound, and Hoff claimed that he
had cut It with a tack in a piece of car
pet. The Injury was a contused lacerated
wound In the palm of the left hand about
half an inch deep. A coupling pin. such as
was In evidence, would produce just such
a wound. The raised burr at the head of
the pin would exactly correspond with the
length of the wound. A. nail or a tack
would -not make such a wound.
"Captain John Â¦ Seymour Identified the
coupling pin as the one he brought to the
City Hall from . S03 Guerrero street. The
pin was admitted in evidence by Judge
Cook. Seymour arrived at the house

If his divorced wife carries out her plans
to oppose him. Roberts was rejected by
Congress, who fourd him guilty of con
tracting bigamous marriage, and Wilcox's
case is identical with that of Roberts.
The white population of the Hawaiian
Islands Is determined, that Wilcox shall
not represent their interest in Congress,
and every effort is being made to prevent
him doing so. There can be little doubt
aa to the action Congress will take In the
contest, for the case of Brigham Roberts
forms a precedent which is not likely to
be set aside.
Wilcox, who is a "half-white." won the
prince&s as his bride when he was a mili
tary student In Italy and the protege of
tho late King of Hawaii. The blandish
ments and roseate stories he painted had
a rude awakening when the couple
reached their island home in 1S97. Dis
gusted with her husband's actions, the
young princess fled to this city, where her
child was born. Wilcox followed her and
for a time they were in the direst straits.
Wilcox went back to Hawaii and his wife
was assisted to return to her home in
Italy. Four years ago she filed suit for
annulment of the marriage In the Italian
courts, and shortly afterward Wilcox
married the Princess Koehelelani, a de
scendant of the Kamehamehas, despite
the fact that his Italian wife had not yet
secured her legal freedom. Since Wilcox
and his Italian wife separated she has
always expressed the most bitter feelings
toward him, and if she should come to
Washington to protest against his being
seated in Congress, it Is satfe to assume
that she will not decorate him with "leis"
or welcome him with "alohas."
Judgment is thereupon given for the
plaintiff for $2240. less-JCOO, for which the
stock was sold, and the $120 interest to de
fendant, leaving a remainder of J1520 with
6 per cent Interest on that sum from Oc
tober 31. 1S94.
Section 6201. of the Revised Statutes of the
T-nlted States prohibits banks from dealing
In their stock except to protect themselves
against debts, and while attention has not been
called to any statute directly prohibiting what
these parties did, it Is clearly against the
spirit of the law to make such contracts as
they attempted to carrv out. To allow bank
officers to deal In the stock of the bank be
tween themselves, and to make such contracts
as the parties attempted to make In thlf
caee, would opÂ»Â»n the door to innumerable
frauds. The sale of the stock by the defend
ant to the bank cannot be sustained. The
bank, however, subsequently sold the stock for
J600. and as It had the upe of the defendant's
JTOOO for a year, he should be allowed for that
use the legal Interest of 6 per rent, equaling
$120, but he is not entitled to the $120 for al
leged salary, the allowance of that having
been a inert pretext to pay him 12 per cent
Interest as agreed.
On October 25. 1893. the defendant purchased
of the bank twenty shares of its stock, for
which be paid J2000, with the agreement be
tween him and the president and cashier of
the bank that at any time within a year he
could return the stock and be repaid the pur
chase price and 12 per cent interest thereon.
Thereupon he was elected a director and vice
president of the bank, and at the end of the
year he returned the stock and the eame o..
oere received It and paid him therefor $2349
but instead of paying him 12 per cent Inter
est they allowed him 6 per cent, amounting
to tl20, and allowed him the additional $130 for
salary as vice president. Notwithstanding his
surrender of the stock, he continued for more
than a year to act as director and vice presi
dent, the stock In the meantime remaining
upon the books of the bank In his name. Sub
sequently the bank sold the stock for $600.
In commenting upon the foregoing find
ings Judge Beatty says:
United States District Judge Beatty of
Idaho has handed down a decision In the
case of P. W. Strader. receiver of the
Bennett National Bank, vs. H. B. Bate
man, tried In the United States Circuit

Whereas The mpdtcal faculty of the College
of Physicians and Surgeons feel the great loos
suffered by the resignation of a man of such
high standing, not only here but wherever Eng
lish Is spoken and the science of medicine
known: therefore, be It
Resolved That we, the members of the medi
cal faculty of the College of Physicians and
Surgeons of San Francisco, deeply . regret his
resignation and take this means of assuring
him not only of our high appreciation of his
valuable services to the college, but of our
desire to ever retain his best wishes and friend
ship. H. ROSENTHAL, Chairman.
"The?Â© resolutions are all very nice and
gratifvlng." said Dr. Potter, "but the
fact that the real grievances of the best
wishers of the college were not given con
sideration either by the trustees or the
faculty shows the dominating influence
that controls the Institution so lnlml
cally."
THE many rumors which have
gained wide credence that a con
test would be made against Rob
ert W. "vVllcox. the Hawaiian del
egate-elect, taking his seat In
CongTess have been verified In the last
few days, and it now appears that the
prime mover in the proposed contest
against Wilcox is no less a person than
his divorced wife, the Princess Gina Co-
Ionna Sobrero de Stagliono. Wilcox soon
after his arrival in this city ridiculed the
idea that any opposition would be made
to his taking his seat In Congress, and
declared that his enemies In the Hawaiian
Islands had simply trumped up a case in
accusing him of bigamy, r.nd that his di
vorced wile, who is in Italy, had and still
has the kindliest feelings toward him.
In a letter to a lady who resides In tho
southern part of the State the Princess
Colonna recently wrote that she contem
plated a visit to America in the near fu
ture, and then says: "I can never for
give the man who ruined my young life
and who deceived me into marrying mm
by wicked and false stories as to our fu
ture life in Hawaii. The post of honor
to which he aspires in the Congress of
America shall never bo his. If I can stop
it, and for that reason I shall soon visit
your country."
Judging by the action which Congress
took In the case of Brigham Roberts of
Utah who was not allowed to take his
seat in the national legislature, there
seems to be little chance of Wilcox ever
being worn in as a member of Congress,
a suggestion; "but what Is the use of
squandering money on leleqrams? I know
everything is all right. I wrote to my sis
ter to-Gay nnd In t^n days' time I shall
have an answer. I am no' impatient and
ffel perfectly content to wait till then.

according to his will, between myself, my

and Mrs. BrÂ»tson of Montrealâ and their
children, my three nieces. I have decided

The only conditions upon which I would

the full number allowed by law and (2) the
changing of those of the present officers of

With many regret* that the circumstances
are such as to compel me to sever m^ con

According to Information later received
by Dr. Potter this communication never
reached the faculty. It was presented to
the faculty meeting and by a aeries of
parliamentary tactics was placed on the
table without being read or receiving the
slightest consideration. On November 13
Dr. Potter received a set of complimen
tary resolutions as follows:
College of Physicians and Burgeons
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal.. Nov. 13, 1900.
Dr. 8. O. L. Potter, San Francisco, Cal.â
Dear Doctor: By direction of the medical fac
ulty of the College of Phyaicians and Surgeons,
I tore the honor to present to you the follow
ing resolutions adopted by the faculty at a
meeting held November 7, 1900.
Under these circumstances I cannot consent
to have any further association with a body
which has absolutely ignored a respectful and
eerious set of charges made by one of its
members against its management bf the affairs
of the Institution. The .facts above recited
speak for themselves and will no doubt com
mend to your Judgment the position taken by
me. My self-respect would not permit me to
continue a member of the board after my re
monstrance was treated with silent contempt.
In regard to my continuing in the faculty I
beg to say that with the present restricted
membership of the board of trustees the finan
cial and educational status of the college Is
not sufficiently guarded or conserved. As the
board is now constituted four men can rule
the Institution without hindrance and can
spend its earnings (188,000 in four years) with
out question.
Its educational and professional standards
are being steadily lowered by tne admission
of students of known bad antecedents, some
having been given two years' advanced stand
ing though not entitled to any such. The
faculty Is steadily and 'deliberately Ignored In
the management of the college; its standing
committees are not arpolnted and the powers
originally given to It have been usurped by
the officers of the board of trustees. No col
lego can last long in this country under such
arbitrary management as this and I cannot
lend whatever Influence I have among students
and in the medical profession, to support a
policy which I do not approve or to sustain
educational methods which I have strenuously
opp'osed all my life.
On the 17th of last month I presented to your
board of trustees, of which I was then a
member, a formal remonstrance concerning cer
tain changes In policy and certain faulty acts
of administration in the management of the
college. A copy of this remonstranca Is ap
pended hereto for your Information. I pre
sented It in person, at a meeting called for
the purpose of hearing a committee appointed
some time previously on the finances of the
college and to suggest Improvements in its ad
ministration. I was a member of that com
mittee, but I did not report as such, for the
reason that I found my coadjutor adverse to
my chief recommendation,' namely, the Increase
of the board of trustees to fifteen members.
Hence I made an Individual report. I with
drew immediately after presenting It, saying
that I did Â«o In order to enable the board to
discuss It freely, unembarrassed by my pres
ence. The paper waa received and read at
that meeting. 1 waited ten days for some
official request to substantiate my statements
or for some conference by committee or other
wise concerning the serious charge* brought
by me against the management of the college.
Hearing nothing whatever In that time I sent
my resignation to the beard on the 27th ultimo,
and this was acknowledged by the secretary
pro tem. under date of September 28, saying
that both papers would be taken up at" the
regular meeting on October 1. On October 3
I received the formal acceptance of my resig
nation. Taut no mention then or since of my
remonstrance or of any action by the board
thereon.
Immediately following Dr. Potter's res
ignation a committee of the faculty, of
which Dr. E. E. Kelley was the chair
man, waited upon Dr. Potter and asked
him to withdraw his resignation, state
his reasons therefor and remain, at least
a professor emeritus. Dr. Potter made
repiy and duly transmitted the following
letter, together with a copy of the report
to the board of trustees, which has al
ready been made public:
1220 SUTTER STREET,
BAN FRANCISCO, Cal.. Oct. 29, 1900.
To the Medical Faculty. College Physicians
and Surgeons of San Franciscoâ Gentlemen : I
nave the honor to acknowledge your request,
made by your committee, that I would con
tinue my connection in some manner with the
College of Physicians and Surgeons. While
I am flattered by this mark of your confidence
I feel that I cannot make any proper answer
thereto without Informing you fully of the
reasons for my resignation and the circum
stances attending it.
The trustees desire me to say that they regret
exceedingly that you have seen fit to take this
step, that they have always entertained and
dp now entertain for you a very high degree of
respect, have considered you a most excellent
teacher, a safe counselor and a true friend,
and that your resignation has been accepted
only because they believed that it was offered
with sincerity and that no measures which they
might adopt would be sufficient to change your
purpose. They desire me to extend to you
their very best wishes for your health and
prosperity, and hope that in severing your con
nection with the college they have not lost a
friend. Tours truly, D. A. HODOHEAD.
Secretary Pro Tem.
''This was promptly accepted and a let
ter In response to mine of resignation,
without reference to the matters con
tained in the original communication, was
received. It states:
College of Physicians and Surgeons,
SAN FRANCISCO. Cal., Oct. 3. 1900.
S. O. I,. Potter, A.M., M. D.. 1220 Sutter

ing of the board of trustees held October 1
your letter of September 27, 1900. In which
you resign all connection with the College of

motion duly seconded, was accepted.

tlemen: Referring to my unanswered letter df
September 15 for the reasons for this action,

"In order that the members of the
board of trustees might be untrammeled
In their discussion of the report. 1 left tho
room, and after waiting to hear of some
action being taken In the matter by the
trustees without avail, I sent the follow
ing letter of resignation:
EAK FRANCISCO, Sept. 27, 1900.
Dr. Bamuel O. L. Potter, whose resigna
tion from the board of trustees of the
College of Physicians and Surgeons ex
posed the internecine Btrife in that insti
tution, returned on Sunday evening from
Arizona. He expressed yesterday his sur
prise at the fact that so much bad feel
ing existed between past and present
members of the board of trustees and fac
ulty. ;.:.'-â¢
"I had no part In bringing the matter
to the attention of Hie public," he Bald,
"but I feel that the correspondence lead-
Ing to my resignation and the causes
therefor should be made public. I was on
a committee of the board of trustees to
corroct the abuses of the present man
agement and to endeavor to devise a plan
that might serve to take the institution
out df the hands of the clique which
seemed to be running it into the ground.
"In my report of September 15 I pro
posed a remedy, which was to increase
the membership of the board of trustees
to the full strength authorized by lawâ
namely, fifteenâ by admitting thereto all
the original members of the college, tho#e
who first met together and agreed to Join
in the movement and who are still mem
bora of the college faculty. I then set
forth In extenao my reasons for this
course, which have already been presented
in full in The Call.
