Each animal has h!s own basins, pans and

of agateware, plainly marked with the
horse's name, and are never used for any
other horse. A racehorss has many sÂ«ta

taugnt three Iron-clad rules. "Tou must

"neither mi:st you 6tami still for even
one moment. And you must have faith In
our ability to carry you safely through

\ When all is In readiness* a procession
Â¦ is formed, there being no restriction on
* the number of persona to participate. The
nativ.es are barefooted and decorated with
rirlrsmlf) of flowers, and the Europeans
clad, in heavy boots.

During the month of July, 1899, a party
witnessing the Umu Tl at Ralatea tried
to get snapshots of the affair, but diffi
culty was met In the densenesa of th*
steam..
A fair photo was obtained of the di
rector of the Uv 8. 8. Company walking:
through the Umu Ti. He said afterward
that the only discomfort he felt was thÂ«
Intense heat on his face â as great as
he could bear. |
"My boots were heavy." he said. *TÂ»nt
I do not see how they could have saved
my feet from blistering. I have walked
over sidewalks i In the Eastern States
when the sun heat upon the planks was
jÂ«o great that It pained my feet at every
step. And in this flre-walking proposi
tion the stones are red hot; no, they are
white hot.
â¢â¢Why was It that they didn't burtT It's
more than I know.
"To be sure, I did try to have faith in
the prlest3, but I am not certain that
I succeeded. It teems to me that In my
heart of hearts I really expected to be

At the conclusion of the procesifon cv

was astonished.to hear a regular and con
tinuous buzzing noise, somewhat similar
to the sound made by water when boiling
In an open vessel, though sometimes a
higher note would be struck Dy-one or
another of the ants.
Further study of the: box r of prisoners
revealed many interesting, facts. ,< The free
ants, were seen to advance to the sides
of the ' ones,' that could not 'move, and to

the sounds made by the ants became
louder and more stringent. It was evi
dent that these sounds Â¦ conveyed , some
meaning, for a palpable difference was
to be found in *the minute utterances,
which must have been intelligible to thÂ»
tiny captives. ;â¢ ' '
Then came* the problem. How was tho
sound; made? M. Ferel proceeded to at
once' make minute Investigations, and
submitted live ants to the scrutiny of a
very powerful microscope.
Here, again, an Interesting discovery
was In store for the Investigator. The
sides of the little Insects were found to be
in one particular place rough and scaly,
resemblingâ though.'of 'course, on a tiny
scaleâ the teeth of*a saw. It was by rub
bins .this that the ant marie the sound
that had rewarded the scientist's re
search,
SIR JOHN LUBBOCK, as well as
many other scientists, hns of courea ;
studied the ant.,.but it has been ,
given to a Frenchman, a M. Ferel,.
to make a discovery as regards ants that
proves them to be possessed of an in- j
telligence far greater than has been hith- â¢
erto supposed.
And this discovery is nothing more or
less than that ants are capable of pro
ducing sounds intelligible to their fellows,
and even audible to our earsâ in o # ther
words, that they converse with one an
other.
The way M. Ferel proved this was as
follows: â¢= .< ,,Â¦,.,-**, . . ,

AVhile the ants were still in a state of

SN the St. Jan-e:; Budget T. A. Vance calls attention to the
mania for big words among men of science and gives some
amusing examples: Mr. Herbert Spencer, in his "First Prln
clpleÂ«." the first volume of his Synthetic Philosophy says
that "Evolution Is an Integration of matter and concomitant
dissipation of motion, during which the matter passes from an
Indifferent. Incoherent homogeneity to a definite, coherent
heterogeneity, and during which the retained motion undergoes
a. parallel transformation." I csn remember many years ago
hearing an acquaintance reel off a remarkable paraphrase of
that good old saw. "People who live In glass houses should not
throw etones." This Is the way he put It: "Individuals Inhabit
ing domiciles of crjBtalllne structure ehould refrain from the
projection of missiles of granitic formation."
The late George John Romanes was another Â»dentlÂ«t who
fairly reveled In bl* words. Â«e played with them. Juggled
them into sentences, and the average reader cannot help losing
himself in the bewildering: maze. Two examples from his
'"Examination of Weismannism." his best known work will
Illustrate the point. They are selected at random. Romanes
In speaking of plant life says: "All themulticellular organisms
propagate themselves, not exclusively by fission or gemma-"
tion. bat by sexual fertilization." Which, translated -to com
mon Ensllsh, means that the higher plants xnultlp'y not only
by division and buds but by seeds. A little further on Mr
Romanes speaks of the "undifferentiated idioplasm of the first
or-togenetic stage."
Buch words are simply staggering. The other day I met
with the v.-ord "idiodactylae. tf The Standard Dictionary defines
It thus: "A phalanx of collomorpic oscine birds.". Of course
the meaning of the word was at once made clear. In some
readings on entomological subjects I met with the word
â¢â¢planiper.nia." which the Standard eays is a name given to a
BUb-Qffder of neuropterous Insects with multinervate wings and
multiarticulate antennae.
The definitions of scientific words in the Standard Diction
ary, as may be inferred by the examples cited, are not char
acterized by extreme simplicity of language. The reader Is
Informed that the "acanthocephaJa" Is the name given to an
order of "r.cmatelmlnth worms without a mcuth or intestinal
canal, but with a retractile proboscis covered with hooks, com
prising echinorhynchidae." The "arcturldae" are a "family of
leopods. with Inferior opercullform uropods, and with the an
terior (four) pairs of legs ciliated and the posterior (three)
ambulatory." Taking, up the study of a shellfish, one finds that
the rhopaJodlnidae are a "family of diplostomldeaa holothur
lanf. having a flask-phaped body." Most people know at least
what a flask is like.
Professor Hyatt in an article on the nautilus in the Amer
ican Naturalist tella us that "the leading characteristic of
parallelism In all genetic series of . nauttllolds Is a tendency
toward closer coiling anfl greater Involution in the mere spe
cialized forms cf each separate series, and a correlative in
crease in the profundity of the impressed zone."
Professor Cope. In his "Primary Factors of Organic Evolu
tion," tells his reader that "in the first case, that of the human
elbow, the cubltus was luxated posteriorly, so that the humeral
ccndylcs articulate with the ulna, anterior to the coronold
process." The translator of Kibot's "Psychology of Attention"
tries to tay that when we arc happy wÂ© forge't our surround
ings. He puts It In this way: "Intense enjoyment produces a
momentary unity of consciousness."
Time was. concludes Mr. Vance, when a word to the wise wao
Bufncient. Nowadays it must be a mighty long word or it will
Dot do. Time was when the BChool boy could recite with satis
faction both to himself and teacher:

OJfE of the most notable features in connection with the
siege of Klmberley is the callous way in which the In
habitants treated the Boer bombardment, even finding
i to celebrate three weddings during. the progress of
lostllitles. However unique this may seem, reference to past
campaigns, says the London Tit-Bits, will reveal othei- case3
of a similar nature. Even after the slaughter of Waterloo two
weddings came off in the field, one being especially pathetic In
â¢ detail. A young officer in a well-known cavalry regiment sent
,' direct from England was ordered to leave home a fe 1 *- days
before he was to have been married, and his flance>s, dis
appointed and anxious at the turn things had taken, decided to
fellow him, despite his protests. This she did unknown to her
lover, and was In the neighborhood when the great battle was
fought.
After the victory she failed to gain any news of him. so,
thinking he must have fallen, employed a peasant, aad to
gether they searched the field. After some hours shu came
upon him. lying half-buried beneath a bloody heap of i.la own
comrades and (lead horses in that part of the field whore the
conflict had raged fiercest. He was not dead, and at his re
quest she sent the peasant "for a priest, and not long afterward
they were married, where he lay. only to be separated a llttlo
later by death.
A burly guardsman furnished the next case In point, which
was a happier one, f^r beyond a wound In the right arm the
bridegroom was in excellent health and spirits. The marriage
was celebrated at daybreak, on the raornlns after the battle,
and was conducted by the priest who had a moment before
been readlnj? mass over the slain.
Even the misery which existed In the trenches before 1
Stbastopol during the dreary winter of 1S31 was broken by a
wedding celebrated In actual battle, the desultory firing from
\the city forts and the corresponding booming of our guns tak
ing the place of the wedding march. The bride was connected
with the nursing department, and had for some time previously
been under Miss Florence Nightingale, until sent nenrer tho
scene of hostilities, where she met and fell In love with a cor
poral In one of tho regiments of foot. Furthermore, one of tho
first functions held in Sebastopol after Its fall by our troops
was a wedding ceremony between a young lieutenant and a
Russian girl of noble birth, who had some time prior to the
event turned against her country and come over to the British
camp. She- returned to, England with her husband, who even
tually became a soldien-of repute.
During the siege of Strasburg by the Germans la the war
of 1870 no fewer than forty-two weddings were solemnized In
the city, even while the enemy's sheila were falling In the
streets. All of them were safely carried despite the perilous
surroundings with the exception of one. and In this case a shell
fell near the happy couple on their way home from the church,
killing the bridegroom among a number of. others. In another
Instance a shell struck the church while the ceremony was In
progress, bringing down a portion of the tower, but fortunately
no one was Injured.
Nursing sisters have frequently been wedded to their soldier
lovers almost before the echoes of battle have died awav

a more responsive chord In this particular
region. Of course, the habits of economy

even here It Is Â¦ as useless _s , it Is easy
for we comfortable, successful Individual,
selves to the lakes and mountains of
Switzerland ' or >~ the heather-scented
moors of Scotland, but such luxury is not
to be dreamed of by the actor of "Poverty
CornÂ«r." The salary received during his
nionths of labor would not have been suf
ficient to tide him over this unwelcome
period. of "rest" even^were he v cut on the
economical plan, which, as everybody
knows, is not frequent in the profession.
Translating the word "resting" into
"looking for an engagement," remember
ing that- protracted idleness' in the case
of the humble pVayer wholly dependent
upon his fitful salary means inevitable
hardship and privation, *nd bearing in
mind that for every post he seeks there
will be at least a dozen applicants as
good as himself, It becomes easy to un
derstand the harassed, drawn, anxious
look upon the face of the man and. worse
yet, of the woman who has the misfor
tune to be "resting." .
But "Poverty Parade" Is not made up
entirely of "has beens," nor yet of those
who never will be. Many of the most
conspicuous characters are actors who
could hardly be called unsuccessful, but
who In popular parlance are, simply said
to be "resting." When the late summer
brings In Its train a general closing of
the Thespian shutters, when the last of
the London season's theatrical successes
has given up the ghost and the touring
companies one by one have been disband
ed, then Is "Poverty Parade" the most
replete and the most melancholy, swelled
as It Is to startling proportions by the
presence of players who are "restinir."

Slowing- impressionism of your own de

unknown to charitable organizations, al
though presenting a scene of poverty an<J
"carking care" of blighted hopes and-van
ished illusions comr-=red with which the
znoat sordid aspects of squalor and misery
as seen among London's pocr lose some
thing of their pathos. Among theatrical
people It is known as 'I overty Corner"
and Is the recognized haunt of the unem
ployed actor, the poor down-at-heels, out
at-elbows "histrionic artist," who at cer
tain seasons finds no more profitable way
of passing his days than of waiting In sol
emn procession with his equally unfortu
nate brethren for "something to turn up."
The Irony of fate has located "Poverty
Corner" Â¦within a stone's throw of the
Strand, that teeming, bustling part of
London which, a? everybody knows, is the
very heart of stageland. Almost within
the shadow of the theaters which have
witnessed his successes, almost within
$ound of the applause welcoming the suc
cesses of those who have superseded him,
the "has-been" actor waits about from
C&j to day. contemplating his own in
creasing seedlness and wondering bitterly
where the next meal Is coming from. At
any hour cf the afternoon, particularly at
this season, when most of the London
theaters are closed, this "poverty parade"
may be witnessed; for this is the season
of the actor's vacationâ a vacation, alas,
not sought for nor relished by those who
constitute the "email fry"' of the profes
sion, earning as they do at best a very
precarious livelihood.
London, they tell me, boasts more than
one "Poverty Corner." Away over Lon
don bridge, amid the rattle and roar of
unceasing traffic and the strident cries of
the street hawkers, one may find at any
time throughout the year a hive of "lit
tle** aetors. of cheap dancers, singers and
musicians, the hangers-on of the music
halls, to whom any offer, no matter how
Fmall, Involving- some regular employment
would mean Joy unspeakable. The "Pov
erty Corner" that I speak of. the one not
a hundred yards- from the busi^t part of
the Strand, Is of a little higher class and
consequently suggests a deeper pathos.
Here the played-out gentleman actor
abounds; he who has . ad his <lay and has
ltved to find himself going inch by inch
down the other side of the hill whose
eummlt he has passed. If there be any
thing In life more tragic, more pathetic,
more productive of madness and despera
tion than this silent, gradual losing of
one's giip, I don't know what it may be.
At "Poverty Corner" the man with the
shiny frock coat and the old top hat, who
wm pointed out to me as a celebrity of
by-gone days, as onÂ© who In the olden
times awoke the echoes of famous ojd
Drury In the character of Marc Antony,
Inspired me with the greatest compassion
âmore than the youngster, although pale
and gaunt, whose look was one of rebel
lion acalnst the world that refused to give
him a chance. For surely It Is more to
â¢"have been" than never to be. The un
successful climb toward unexplored
heights I cannot picture as a circum
stance compared with the madness and
despair of slipping away from heights
that once have been attained.
At "Poverty Corner" a woman hangs out
these bright September days who years
a|o had hoped to thrill th<Â« world as the
Ideal Juliet. Hera was to have been an

Miss Mack has already shown herself
possessed of a most discriminating liter
ary taste, as well as' a profound acquaint
ance with the masterpieces of the poetry
of our language by her remarkably popu
lar collection of love poems, the widely
known "Because I Love You." She has
now U5*>d her talent in an even more noble
and sympathetic way by compiling a well
chosen collection of pcems of comfort and
hope, happily named from a quotation.
"Heaven's Distant Lamps." j The contents
are arranged In thirteen sections, each
prefaced by a short quotation, the senti
ment of which elves the keynote to the
poems of that division. Thus the theme
of the first section is seen tu be bereave
ment, of the next comfort, then submis
sion, prayer, resignation, each group be
coming more Â£rand and strong in its tone
until the closing division, wiiich is given
up to poems of the resurrection and" para
dise. It would be very difikuk to (Uid a

tion of extracts from their verse, and cer

appearance of the volume in its dress of

The Stcry of Aloncy.
When Questions long disputed' are under
public consideration and the controversy
assails the ears of every man so that
none can escape from it there is always
a considerable number who desire above I
all things to find some man with derided
views on every issue In disjiute who px
presses himself with vigor, who admits
no right or reason on tlse side of those
who differ from h!m, and establishes his
judgment with all the firmness cf one who
toierates no appeal. Such persons who
may be wearied, with the free silver con
troversy will find pleasure in a book by
Edward C. Towne entitled "The Story of
Money."
Elcrr)2r)ts of Latir)
. Mr. Towne does not wait even to make
a beginning of his argument before anni
hilating his adversaries. He does. that in
his "foreword." and the quality of his
work may be estimated by what he says
there. A single paragraph will sufllce.
Referring to the proposed free coinage of
silver at the ratio of 16 to .1. he says:
"No Instance in history ran bo brought tc
parallel tho rascal stupidity cf a scheme
involving such an offer, and with proR
ress and prosperity so immensely ad
vanced since 1835. the crash of a Bryan
experiment of 'fool fury' in finance would
be worse than a'.l the costs and miseries
of the Civil War. If any possible advan
tage could be expected from either free
silver legislation â¢ and administration
thereafter, or free silver now. the mad
ness of 16 to 1 would be less extreme than
it is. But no possible advantage can be
imagined except upon a basis of hoodlum
ignorance yr of rascal indifference to truth
and fact."
There are 24S pages In the bock and all
are about as vigorous as the foreword.
Any one who wishes to Fee how the silver
question can be taken out of the domain
of disputed things and settled upon the
ground of morality will find the book in
teresting. Mr. Towne is in favor of what
he calls "gold, bimetallism"â that Is to
say, "gold the standard or measure of
value and silver subsidiary." (Published

the collection grew -out of a studio evening

If we except the treat Napoleon, has
proved a more popular subject for the
biographer Than VmvX Jones, no less than
fifteen persons nft.vins> t-ssayed to write
the story of his life. Mr. Brady labors
under one diirrnlvantage in having placed
his bock before th* public contemporane
ously with tho more pretentious work or.
the sar.jc subject by Augustus C Buell.
While the latter author has through
conscientious research succeeded in jjtv-
Inc as nn authoritative and in most re
Â«-p<*cts admirable picture of the grÂ» at
sailor. Mr. lirady has endowed his sub
ject with a charm that appeals directly
to tho general reader. As he states in his
preface. he began his work with an ar
dent admiration for the character of his
subject He has endeavored, however, to
my aside this predisposition in his favor
nr.d te absolutely a:id strictly impartial,
lie frunUly adiis, however, that if he has
erred In Jor.es' iavor he is plad that he
has followed tiie impulses of affection
lather than those of deprecation.
Mr. Brady's associations a::<l the naval
uimosphcre In which he has . ii\Â«M tor
years are perhaps accountable in a degree
for his expressed bias. Be that as It may,
no American can find . fault with the
author.
No m&n was more vilely slandered In
h\h lifetime than Paul Jones, and It is sur
prising that even to the present day there
ere to be found writers so blinded by
prejudice as to asperse his memory. It is
unnecessary to say that these men are of
British birth and appear to be still smart
ing under the wound inflicted upon the
jiational pride by that affair off Klambor
oush Head more than a century ago.
The sincerity and admiration for his
subject is shown by Mr. Brady when he
say*-:
""It is all so mournful in some strange
way. In Fpite of his glory and his hero-
Ism, in spite of his strenueus life and his
strugglinss, the note that lingers In my

Nothing is . better for a boy than the
reading of a book of good, wholesome ad
venture; a book that will hold his atten
tion by" its /interesting plot or thrilling
events and 'at the same-time instruct him
along some particular line of history or

and with Â¦ a certain historical accuracy
Â¦sufficient' to be of educational value. â¢
Â¦One of the best works of this. class for
the year is -"Gold Seeking on the Dalton
Trail." -by Arthur R. Thompson. The
'Klondike and the far north have been
rather" neglected for. Juvenile readers, but
the present work mbre than makes up
for the discrepancies of, the past. It tells
of- the adventures of two boys, accom
panied by their father and uncle, who
made a trip along the Dalton 1 trail toward
â¢the Klondike. A splendid feature of the
book is the numerous illustrations repro
duced from excellent photographs of ac
tual Bcenes on the trail. â¢ : , .â¢
I Mr. Thompson guarantees the authen
ticity of his writings as follows; '
The book is written in a popular vein,
is easy of comprehension, most Interesting
and Instructive, and will appeal to tha
general reader as well as to the student.

The book treats of animals from tha
polr;t of view of the student of animal
life, who -wishes to know why animals
are In structure and habits as they are. It
teaches that tha whole life of animalsâ
that all the variety of animal form and
habitâ Is an expression of thÂ© fitness ot
animals to- the varied circumstances and
conditions of their, living, and that thlÂ«
adapting and flttlnz of their life to tha
conditions of living cosno about Inevitably
and naturally, and that It can be readily
studied and largely understood. In this
kind of study of animals every observa
tion of a fact In animal structure or bo

mal, of this fact. .

fact that a student deduces for himself

To Thomas James belongs the distinc

uncanr.lcst bed chamber ever devise:! by
man. Imagine a "vault about ten feet

tcsttogly admits stray, chilly beams of
light. Around the lower sides are four
Inscribed tablets, almost illegible for

ple have been sealed for nearly half a
century. On the floor are two moldy cof
fins, which, for some reason, have long
since been removed from their crypts.
Such a place Is the Hensler vault, and
here cf all places on top of the good
creen earth Thomas James chose to live.
The exterior cf this vault is ona of the
handsomest In the cemetery, but the dead
owners, evidently left no means to keep

lected. Over the moldy floor are scat
tered dust and crumpled leaves that have
blown helter-skelter into the silent,
creepy place. The lock on the heavy iron
door Is broken and has been replaced by
a piece of common rope. So James did
not have to force his entrance. Looking
through this grilled Iron door is a pros
pect of close-cropped shrubbery and
patches of green, spotted with everlasting
tombstones, monoliths and mausoleums?^
And In this \tzre. forbidding vault
Thomas James ate and slept. By day he
moved with the living; at night he lay
cown with the skeletons of the dead.
"Afraid?" he repeated from behind the
prison bars; "what of? Those dead peo

millionaires in adjacent mausoleums who
ml^ht be indignantly protesting against
any untidy tramp invading: their exclusive
sleeping quarters, this strange man
wrapped the ragged draperies of his coach
about him and, sustained and soothed by
an unfalterable trust In his own indom
itable nerve, he lay down to pleasant
dreams. He snored peacefully through
the still watches of the night till a rude
policeman clubbed him into a wakefulness
and carted him eff to a common Jail.
For nearly two months he had lived,
there and he might bs> living there now,
quiet and undisturbed, had it not been,
for his passion for cleanliness. And clean*
liness, according to savants and joke
smiths, i3 a very unusual trait among
tramps, but as was said before. Thomas
James of Butte. Mcnt., la not an ordinary
tramp and is a very unusual man else he
wouldn't have preempted a vault for
a residence. His presence there was ac
cidentally discovered because he hung his
wash in back of the vault to dry in the
sun. The extraordinary sight of a weekfs
wash hung outside a vault occupied by
people long slr.ee dead simply dynamited
the attention of an unobtrusive police
man. Besides the flagrant rags flapping 1
In the gleeful air were in a quarter cf the
cemetery assigned exclusively to the
purse-proud rich and the most obtuse
passerby knew no vault tenant In that
aristocratic section would be guilty of
doing his own wash. And that vulgar
wash cost James his home in the vault.
Instead he was given a cell in Jail.
James did not feel a single thrill of fear
during his two months' residence with,
the dead. His curiosity regarding the fu
ture waa tourded on one side by a cofflrt
bearing the urns Oiled with his provisions
and on the other sie'e by his bunk beslda
a companion coffin. His superstition never
strayed bevond the chance to eat and
sleep.
Within that narrow compass he glanced
unconcerned at dumfounded Fate and
sat nonchalantly between the coffins,
ready to shake Fortune for a cheese sand
wich or match with Destiny for the beer.
Not a Jot of Imagination had he. or hÂ«
couldn't have taken up his residence la
such an uncanny place: He wouldn't
take ,any stock In the spirit manifesta
tions''of the Eddy sister3; he couldn't see
spooks with the Lick telescope: and he
wouldn't fancy snakes if he had the ca
pacity to hold the output of the whisky
trust.
""Why shouldn't I take it easy there?**
said James. "A man hasn't many chances
In life to be comfortable and he'd better
take "em while he can. Nobody bothered,
me when I was taking It easy In tmoac

kicking for his rent and any plumbers

Bo It had. For James didn't have to pat
a sign "No peddlers" on the vault's door.
No "hello girl" ever rang him up at
drowsy eight hours. No landlord, no
taxes, no "at homes," nothing to do but
keep his back toward the dead and hia

That was one incident on the road to
Peking. Only a small one. after all. for
the town had, never been heard of until
thle war came on, and Peking was famous
before the dark ages.
The terror which the coming of the al
lies etruck into people has probably never
been equaled. The greatest city in the
world was taken with such a panic as'
only a volcano could cause among us.
The suffering must have been terrible
among the aged and infirm, the women
and young children, who were left to
etarve or perish. Many of them spent
days hiding in the mud and rushes of the
river banks, in trees, in cellars and in
wells. We found them everywhere, and
there was enough of murder and brutality
among the Russians to partly Justify their
fears, for all foreigners look alike to
them.

T~2 OR one whole day a Calif or
j[^ man had the Forbidden City
of Peking to himself ; free to
walk where he pleased and take
wliat he fancied.
It took courage to do it. Peking
zvas full of sharpshooters, who hid
in the roofs and took shots at all
who catnc within range.
The Chinese and Tartar eities of
Peking were thronged -with people,
despite the tremendous exodus, yet
the sacred Forbidden City was
empty and silent. Its Tartar mas
ters had left, but though they had
departed, the fear of them had not.
TJie custom of. generations still
bound the timid Chinese and de
terred them from entering the pal
aces of their former masters.
Like the last little boy in the
world Fred U'citzcnburg had a
chance to do just as he wished;
everything was his. He had but to
make up his mind as to zchat he
wanted. Later on men went almost
mad from bang in less tantalising
positions, but he chose well. The
sacred tablets of jade, which the
Emperor worshiped; the great
'jadestcne seals of empire; the most
beautiful statuette of Buddha, a
creation that Bcnvenuto Cellini
would hare been proud to copy; the
fifty-eyed peacock feather of the
Emperor, and private correspond
ence of the Dozvager Tsi Hsi An;
these, v.it 1. jewels and bullion, were
hi' selections. In all there were no
tzci alike, for he was a collector,
and cared not for mere financial
values but for artistic worth.
Never since the fall of Rome was
there such a chance.

of It.

whether or not it was right to take the

The Manchu rnlers of China- came as
robber barons and have 'lived as feudal
lords, taking by the right of might all
that was worth having In the empire, so
the true Chinese were as pleased to see
the allies secure prizes as they were to
get them.
The first taste of loot was secured by
the British" with their Pathan and Sikh
regiments in Tientsin. At that time the\
Americans were too much occupied with
their work for the relief of Peking to pay
any attention even^to the piles of silver
which strewed thÂ»'ground under the ruins
of the mint at the arsenal. A guard was
placed around them to prevent tie Sikhs
from completing their work of cleaning
up the ground and the remainder of the
treasure was secured by the navy after
the army had left for Peking.
But "east, of Suez where there aren t
no ten commandments and the best is like
the worst," good resolutions melt away,
or, rather, arguments and reasons pre
sent themselves which do not exist in any
other part of the world. To see one man

In the Intense heat and after/the suffer
ings the men had gone through on the
march there was but : little vitality In
them. As soon as any needed It they
hired j bearers to carrv them. The poor
coolies felt that they were slaves con-
tha end of their Journey, Instead of being
tortured or decapitated, they wera paid
five or ten times as much as they had
ever before received for the Maine -work.
It was more than they could understand
and the way that they showered heartfelt
thanks and prayers upon us made me
feel that In taking: the hoarded stores of
the Tartar robbers and paying good wages
to the deserving coolies we had done more
right than wrong and that our account
-with the future stood the better for It.
Hunting for the loot of Peking was a
eclenco. We of America who were U3ed
to finding -wealth tn cabinets, 'safes ana
bureau drawers did not understand the
ways of a race who havo for generations
secured their property only by conceal
ment. Under the slime that covered water
poured out by nauseating dra!n3 were
hidden the rarest of gems and stores of
coin, sealed In stone jars which had been
used for preserves. All of these things
were known to the willing coolies who
helped. Sabers were used as prods or
divining rods to locate burled treasures:
bayonets to remove the earth that cov
ered them. It was hard work, and disa
greeable, but the results Justified tea
pains.

eay that statisticians may add to the cir
culating medium of the world at least a
dozen ciphers as its value Is expressed
in American money.
The Japanese did no lootingâ that Is,
the soldiers did not. Any soldier found
with a piece of silk worth a dollar or so
was severely punished.
The Japanese general had other work
for his men- Part of it was to suppress
"snipers," who were hidden on roofs and
In trees to pick us oft with their almost
noiseless afannlicher rifles, and besides
that there was- a busy express line run
ning between the Imperial treasury and
Japanese headquarters.
This was merely because the Japanese
attended to business and had found out
before tlnw where the money was. The
Chinese did not have their strong box
labeled as we do our banks and places of
deposit. Banks In China are usually ma
on. the "Q. T." It Is well for many rea
sons. The Government , has even more
reason to fear, for robbers are bold ar.J
conspirators cunning.
Every time there Is trouble the Japanese
have the same good management to direct
them.
During the last Chlno-JapanesÂ© war It
is said that the Japanese sacked thÂ© Poo

the Tartar rulers had b?en depositing ths

Furh an event as the present. Whether
the Japanese were successful in locating
any considerable amount of money in that
vast pile of buildings xrtth its seventeen
stories above, and no one knows how
many under ground, will never be known,
but there Is one thing certainâ that Japan
has been buiMir.fr herself a new navy
which makes Frar.ce and Russia stare
and yet her debt la r.ot so great and her
credit is good for what she asks.
After the Japanese raid on Jehol thÂ«Â»

The statuettes are from the great tem
ple of the Sacred City. They are of plfl
silver bronie. Tho ono on tho right of
the photograph is tha best of my ooileo
tion and one of the most beautiful in ex
istence. The grace and perfection of Us
outlines grow upon one as he looks until
It becomes fascinating.
The Chinese explain that every point,
line and curve In this statue means some
thing. That It Is a mnemonic and was de-

two seals of the Government axe bod so
old that the characters which are In
scribed upon them are obsolete even, la
that country of slow changes. Tho earr

beauty and taken all In all their varaÂ«
probably exceeds that of any other article)
it was my good luck to secure. Tho im
portance which thÂ» Chinese attach to
seals will doubtless mako tho lou of
these severely felt.
The authority which was represented,
by these two seals waa tho greatest that
any emblem ever possessed. Much won
der has been expressed at the daggers of
the secret service of the palace, which
conferred upon him who carried them tha
power to kill whom ho pleased with Im
punity; in other words the possession of
the weapon was a warrant for the act.
But those daggers gave authority only
over single lives; while the keeper of
these sealed the fate of Viceroys and
provinces. When attached to any docu
ment they made it official and therafor*
might be considered as the emblem of
power over the 300,000,000 people.
Their power Is gone now, and never
again will there be & successor to it. for
the solidity of the empire is & thing of
the past, and hereafter whatever author
ity the Chinese havo will bo minor- and
advisory.
The gems of all of these things, though,
are the ancestral tablets of the late Em
press, mother of the Emperor Kwang Su.
Thero are six of them, of which two
are Intended as covers for the other four.
Three of them are engraved with char
acters of the Manchu language, which is
that used in- the court, and the other
three bear a translation of the same Into
Chinese. They recite the good life, the
position, relationship and name of the
Empress, and were the objects which the
Emperor held In tha hishest veneration
of all lr. the Â¦world^
which on* Â«8*mnes when rldlnf ta * PbO
man ear. They win find that clothes do
help to make a man. Half the dignity, or
more than that , perhaps, of all Oriental
diplomats comes from tha wonderful suits
which their Governments encourage them
to wear. These costumes are made In
large number for the Emperor every year,
much of tha taxes there being tithes pay
able in kind. The result of this la that all
of the * palaces were full of clothing,
spices, silk cloths.raw silk, bullion thread,
'embroidery silks, beads, buttons, scented
woodsâ anything. In fact, that was of
great value.
These snuff-bottles are only a part of
the Emperor's i collection, and some of
them probably belonged to other ofiicfcrd
of the court.
Those which are set on top of the rose
wood chest were packed in it, and are all
eat from solid gems of Jade, carnellan,
agate and other hard stones. They are
perfect bottles, being without a flaw, and
all of the Interior was excavated fromthe
small necks, which are no larger than
those of an ordinary smelling salts bot
tle. There are no holes or plugs cut In
the bottom, as one would expect to find.
but every particle of the Interior has been
polished to the smoothness of glass
through the same small opening.
These snuff-bottles are worth In China
from $25 to $200 each, according to the
stone from which they are cut and their
age. The tallest one on the top of the
box with the spoon beside It is cut from
a solid piece of carnellan In heavy cam*o
relief. The stoppers are of turquoise,
lapis lazuli and coral, with spoons of
Ivory or silver.
There Is a perfect mania among the
English in China for collecting these
snuff-bottles, Just as they collect scarabs
from Egypt, rugs irom Persia or Indian
baskets here. â¢

Itself and when they spend their time in
. contemplating It they are not worshiping
the statue, but impressing' an their minds
those- truths which It represents.
From the number of these Buddhist
statues and the reverence with which the/
were held it must be that the Chinese
are nearly all Buddhists as far as their
religion goes and that Confucianism la
rather & philosophy than a religion wit:i
them. Â¦. ..
The object In front of the middle statu
ette is a sort of an idol's eye. The lower
crsscent-ahaped part is a moonstone, the
dark round one In the middle is some red
stone like a. ruby and the small one sur
rounded by the seven points is a clear
blue stone. This combination was taken
off the principal idol in the great temple.
It was the most adored object in China,
If the place which it occupies is any in
dication of the esteem in which It was
held.
These clothes I found In the palace on
Â¦ the Island where the Emperor was con
fined. Like all of the imperial property,
they bear the picture of the five-toed
dragon, which is exclusively imperial.
Mandarins may have four-toed dragons
and common people may have but three
toed ones, but the five-toed dragon, like
the team of six cream-colored horses in
England, or the sixteen-petaled chrysan
themum In Japan, is reserved exclusively
for the monarch.
It may be true to say that clothes do
not make the man, but they make the
man feel himself a mighty superior sort
of person, when he gets on a suit of lilac
Bilk with a thousand dollars' worth of
gold bullion sewed on it, and pink Â¦ silk
primroses embroidered all around. It
takes a Chinaman to be the real thing In
dudes. The pompom on the hat is the
only one of its kind that there is. Fifty
eyed peacock feathers all fastened to
gether. It does not show, for â¢ they are
all one behind the other, but that Is Ilka
the Chineseâ they do not care to show all
of their wealth, merely to know that it is
there. Here underneath the fringe of the
hat is a pearl worth several hundredjdol
lara and hardly to be seen under lany
circumstances, but like Cleopatra's pearl
in the vinegar, the Emperor knew it was
there and that was sufficient. '
The peacock, which is held In front of
the seÂ«*.eu figure, is unique. It has no
duplicate. It-was to all China what the
scepter is to England. It was borne by
the personal guards of the Emperor as
their standard.
It Is of cloisonne laid upon a gold ground
and v.-lth gold inlaid wires. The beak Is
of solid gold.
The trousers shown in this picture are
a perfect dream of violet silk, embroid
ered more finely than any lady's handker
chief, and the whole scented with the rare

The carved chest is of rosewood, dec
orated with the five-toed Imperial dragon.
There was an Immense amount of carving
of all sorts In the Imperial City. At one
time, before the last war with Japan, the
present Dowager had 5000 wood carvers
working in the palace grounds and upon
the temples and palaces. That was where
the ironey went that had been voted to

ple outside of China have dreamed. It
ls> scented with Jasmine, rose, vanila ami
many, delicate odors which I cannot place
but seem to be compounds of many
things. The perfumes sire very lasting,
and can be smelt upon the hands* for
hours after washing them. Nearly nv-i.-y
Chinese official carries two of these little
bottles In the pouch attached to his
girdle, and meeting a friend the
two bottles are placed upon a table be
tween them and they enjoy in their quiet
and dignified way the delights of Inhal-
Insr the stimulating yet soothing aroma,
made pungent by tho zest of tobacco.
These snuffs cost from $10 an ounce up
ward, and every one prides himself upon
carrying a better quality than his neigh
bor. This custom is almost entirely con
iined to the Mar.chus. or people of North
ern China. In the south it i3 very un
common except In official circles. The
lower. row. of snuff-bottles are of anclen,t
porcelain and cameo cut glass. Reside
them are setting some small jade finger
rings from the apartments of the ladles
of the harem, and a thumb ring, such as
Is worn as a badge of office.
The treasures which will in . time bo
scattered over the world will do much to
elevate the taste for rare articles, but I
most prize mine aa mementoes of tho
Empress Dowager, and the day that X
spent in her Sacred Forbidden City,
The lootlne of Peking was a part of
the punishment which Its people had
brought upon themselves.
Anything connected with this reverence
for ancestors must be of the best and the
tablets of the EmperorÂ» x most- of all.
Nothing mark3 more fully the complete
ness of the downfall of tho Manchu dy
nasty than the loss of these tablets and
that worst of all they should fall into the
hands of Christians. "Fierce and untam
able barbarian devils from across tho
seaÂ«." they called us. A year ago there
were none or them so poor or lowly that
they did not feel themselves far superior
to any living European. Before we had
battered down the three outer gates of the
southern approach to the palace the Chi
nese and T:#tars both had all of their
lantern-makers hard at Â¦work painting lit
tle paper fac-similes of Japanese and
American flags and these they carried
around on tho streets with them for pro
tection.
The Chinese explain In this way their
veneration for ancestors. That the first
man and woman came directly from God
and worshiped him as they should; that
the children cf that first couple worship
ed the God of their parents, making their
prayers not to the God directly, nor to
their parents, but to the God of their pa
rents, so as to make sure that there was
no mistake. So it is to-fiay. They do not
worship idols, which mean no more to
them than altars, stained glass windows
and Bibl*s do to us. but their idols are
allegories serving to remind them of their
duties to rentier thanks to the God their
fathers knew.

which are almost exclusively bought up
by the Chinese and cannot be obtained
efcsewhere at any price. â¢ (
It may be that some people really be
lieve that there Is nothing but vanity In
clothes, 1 but | they cannot wear garments
such as these without feeling a sense of
importance coinlns: over them, like that
tractive in the eyes of the loot-seeking
Sikhs than Peking, for, the Chinese are
very accumulative by nature and fond of
possessing their wealth in solid and sub
stantial form of gold, silver .and jewels
rat..er than bonds, mortgages, notes and
deeds, which are often the sole evidences
of our worldly goods.
Silver is the favorite money in China,
and It taxes only a few hundred dollars'
worth of It to make a heavy load for a
man. For that reason the greater part
of all of the money was left, and was too
bulky to be even readily concealed.' This
would not have been the case had the
population known the true state of af
fairs, but' it is a maxim of the Tartar
rulers that the knowledge of the Princes
should be used for the deception of the
people. For this reason none of tho peo
ple knew until tho very last that tho al
lies were coming, and their first warnlng (
was the, sound of the guns. Even after
that the authorities assured them that the
pigs of foreign devils would never dare to
enter the great capital. > j
When the last minute came no prepara
tions had been made, and the result waa
that personal property was strewn every
where.
The greater part of the silver Is ca^t
Into ingots, such as these I have, ajwayj
of the same peculiar basket shape, thick
on the bottom and thin on the end3, and
of different sizes from one to twenty and
even fifty taels in value.
From what I saw China would be a pax â¢
adise for numismatists. Coins which wer<j
sent with the Spanish Armada; coin*
v.'hich Elizabeth made from the bullioa
"which. Drake brought from the Span'-n '
main; Itoman, French and German coins
all go together, worth so much a pound.
Treasure shipments to China have con â¢
tinucd since history began and as far as
I know this is about the flrst lot which
was ever brought out. most of the re3t
having been depositcl In the banks oi
China and Japan and exchange taken for
It.
Each of the Ingots in the pile on th*
table is stamped with characters show
ing Its weight and value. The rough-look
ing mass is silver which I got at Tien
tsin from the ruins of the mint after the
fire. It is the last coining of that mint,
you might say. Coined by the fire fiend.
The reasons that Ingots are preferred
Is because each has an individuality of it*
The bottom of the seals bear on one
half eld mystical characters, such as
were used In 'the writings of Confucius
and the other classics; signs which are
mystical and emblematic rather than
rraphie. The other half of the seal
bears the antique form of- characters,
which, although unused at the present
nay, are ctlll understood by the literati
axd much admired by every one for grace
Japaaese commissary wagons, ricksha.*-*
and coolie basket carrier* worked under
puard, transferring bullion and coins Into
tbe care of the austere general from the
Island Empire, who would' not let bis
men take even a mat to sleep on, tor
their own use.
So while the Japanese got the credit of
doing r.o looting they also got about all
the money that was to be had. from the
only source whence It could be legally
taker.; that is. the government. There
was undoubtedly much more money In
the private coffers of the Dowager and
y.er favorites of the palace, but this was
largely secured by the Russians, who
put to death every native that they could
- find la their efforts to extort confessions
cs to where valuables were hidden.
There was very little killing for the mere
sake of blood on their part. They usual
ly had interpreters present and merely
kliied In order to make sure that the per
â¢on whom they had under examination
reaJly did not know where anything more
of value was hidden. ;
There will probably he a new batch of
rubies turned out of the Czar's mint this
year and many a one will represent the
equivaJeiu of Chinese blood.
The Americans got the least of all. for
v hat they tock was cither necessary bid
ding or food, with occasionally articles
Which were of historical, literary or sci
entific value.
It is a pity i hat they did not take more,
for in their hands the beautiful statues
and porcelains would have bÂ«en pre
served, while as It was they were left to
be mostly destroyed by the Russians, who
broke them Just to hear the crash.
Officers from the continental armies
icaded themselves with jewels, silks and
statuettes, and while they were stagger-
Ing under these they would try to pick
up a huge bronze or porcelain vase and
then reeling like drunken men fall, crash
ing on the floor with their burden, scat
tering the Jewels, to bo grasped by
other?. It was the chance of a hundred
lifetimes.
tt was a rare piece of good fortune
â¢which sent me into China with the Ninth
United States Infanlry. Never again will
euch tn opportunity for the exploration
cf mysteries be presented, for it was an
excursion into the very heart of the most
â¢Ffcret places of the mest secretive of all
' people.
There is. for Instance, in the interior
of the great Palace of Government in the
Tartar city, a sealed vault which is so
arranged that documents tan be slipped
Into it through a slotted opening, but
none can ever be rt-moved until the great
er-al on the door U broken. This is done
only after the death or deposing of an
Emj>eror. There is attached to the court
a custodian <jf the secrets. To him are
confided all *uch things concerning the
empire as are not to be spoken of in pub
lic or even whispered in confidence. If
the Emperor or any of the. Viceroys do
something which should be recorded, but
which r.o one would dare to speak, it is
written down and scaled and deposited
in this secret closet. In this way free
expression of opinion is recorded, and
b'.'<x the end of the Emperor's rule, these
fecrets are opened and give such a his
:â¢ i.\ u.~ for truth and completeness could
nÂ«?vt-r be secured in any other manner.
It v.ss In^this way that the Empress
Dowager sought to accomplish the un
doing of Kwang Su. One of her objects
in deposing him was to end his n?!gn and
in that manner make it possible for the
custodian of the secret archives to open
hi* vault.
By this the Empress became possessed
cf a!J of the record?, and then abolished

ino s-h'i'jid not be treasure-d against her.
The En-.peror. the Empress Dowager

Ibe two most highly prized things ifi all
of the J": .w< :y Kingdom, the two objects
which Inanimately represented the heart
ani sou! of the empire.
The Tablets of Buddha and Confucius
and the 'Jreat Seals of China are now in
Ban Joe*..
The latlcis are of polished jade, six m
cumber, ftbent four Inches wide, ten
Inches long and half an inch thick.
On them the characters are inscribed
wit!: inlaid gold.
Throe of the tablets bear Inscriptions
In Manchu, and the other three arc
a. translation of the same Into Chinese.
Th* veneration in which these tablets
ere held is inconceivable. Imagine all of
the reverence we have for the Bible, tliÂ«
love and esteem which we ha\-e for our
rarer;? and forefathers, and our respect
end fear of divine power, rolled into. one
indescribable emotionâ that is what the
Chinaman feels for the holy tablets of
his ancestor* c et In tne center of th<k
ancestral shrine which is the focus, of
the. Jlal! of Ancestors that every Chinese
family of honor maintains in state from
generation to g<:r.eration.
The tablets .ire of different forms.
Th^Fe which serve merely as the record
of cr,e family are simple, sometimes only
th* farofly name written in a running
hand on ca.cred paper; others are painted
en wood; some carved en the same or
on stone, and yet others are cut out of
F r .lid jewel etones. But in all the world
there ar* 1 no jewels of such size as the
cet here photographed.
Jade 1* to the Chinese what diamonds
are to us. It Is the fashionable stoneâ
the only one which is considered good
form, and from the fact of its being one
Of the sacred colors It has come to dis
place &\\ others, even the most minute
ornaments being made of it. As to- its
value, one has to price 't !n order to be- â¢
lieve. A small bit half thÂ» size of a pea,
bearing some lucky desltrn, although of .
modern workmanship, will cost as much
a? an Egyptian antique scarab.
I'rom that It may be reasoned what thÂ«
cost of the material alone In these tab
let f is worth.
The seals are blocks of darker gre^n
Jade, almost black in color, the pieces of
f lene from which they were cut are over
tlx inches square and of the rarest tint.
One of the seals was regularly used In
transacting the more Important business
of the Government: the other was evi
dently kept In reserve to use on rare oc
casions, for the characters, besides belngi
Incised, were laid In with thin sheets o!
gold, as If intended for only the most ex
alted purposes. No traces of wax are
visible on this gold-covered one, but the
other has evidently had much use, the
thinner lines being worn down and traces
of wax and abrasions all over the stone.
While those are the most important
pieces of. the collection, they are but 'a
small part of it- Â«
When the English at Tientsin were load-
Ing bullock carts with bullion from the
mint I was searching for those gems
which w.J have a lasting value and will
be remembered in the history of tHÂ«
times long after silver has returned to

was not going to let Mr. Edmund Glover

could never have dreamt possible; and
yet ihore w?.s a kir.d of sti-ig in it, a

of intoxication, was not so very dreadful

lEbury had enlarged the circle of their In

even more political than social The edi

namely, to describe what he called *i Saf '

the guests but a graphic picture of the

Fhow of military, no precautions against

be required, as in Paris or Berlin or St

&!id Larty Salisbury received them; note
thÂ» moÂ£t eminent of the guests and make
about tli rre columns of whit it is custo
mary to kneok ojf in a paragraph."
"What a gathering!" feald Zella with
her accustomed cheerfulness. "Were all
the women beautiful?"
"None *o beautiful as"
Â¦ "Ned, be sensible. Go on with your
utorv; it's like a page of the 'Arabian
Nlphts.* Did they shade the electric
lamps, as they do at our new theater?"
"I he staircase was lighted mostly by
candies; the grand salon wholly by can
Â£les. great bunches of them"
"Oh, I thought you were so up to date In
JjoaGonl"
Â¦"It -skiis quite an up-to-date thing I waÂ«
â¢eat out to do, 1 can assure you, Zella." .
"Well, continue. Ned; I want to know
nil about it. now. I'm sure you didn't
drink too much wine and steal any of the
jewels, or hit some grandeo In the face,
or murder one of those harmless police
men!"
And to Ned's undisguised Irritation
Zella commenced rocking herself to and
fro. not impatiently, but with real enjoy
ment. The truth was very much as she
had expressed it; she felt sure that no
serious crime could have followed such a
falry-llke reception.
"I was among the first arrivals in
Downing street. Never had I seen a more
brilliant assemblage. . . . The buffet
was a marvel. Never had a Premier been
fo lavish: never could he have had more
appreciative guests. Among them were
several eminent newspaper men, two or
three novelists, and quite a number of
painters, to leaven the otherwise regal
crowd of Princes. Princesses. Dukes.
Duchesses, Earls. Countesses, and their
wealthier rivals of the plutocracy, with
row titles and benutlful new coat?-of
arms ... I had made a note or two.
but I had in my mind the complete picture
I would realize in words for the Daily
Times such as all Journalistic -London
would be talking of tho next day. I would
fill the three columns at white heat. . .
Â¦Wen. I did nothing of the kind. . . .
The next morning I awoke In a police
cell!"
"Nedl" she exclaimed, leaning forward
with anxious eyes.
"They charged me with being drunk and
disorderly in the noighbordhood of White
hall, and assaulting >i cabman. '. . .- 1
was fined and lectured by the magistrate..
. . . I had no defense, for I remembered
nothing after the first hour of the recep
tion, when 1 entered tho '-buffet. . . . 1
never iran accustomed to drink much; my
father was a total abstainer, and died of
It, they said. Heaven rest his soul!"
"Poor Ned! Motherless, fatherless. "We
can sympathize with each other."
"And love each other â perhaps," he re
joined.
"Well?"
"I told my story the next n!;rht to my
editor: how 1 had stood by the flower
decked counter of the buffet and asked
for a Mttle brandy tr my coffer: from
which moment the r.irht \vp= a b'ank. as
It Is. indeed, to th!s- day. But- what was
the good of saying so, or suggesting* that
away his brains'? 8ome men have none
to steal, Ned; you have heaps."
"I say, would you dare marry such a
man?"
"If I cared for him. I'd rather marry a
man that confessed his fault than a fel
low who tried to keep It a secret."
"If you cared for him! Don't you care
for me? You said you loved me.
"I do.'a little."
"Only a little?"
"What would you have, now that I
know you get drunk? And you told me
you never took rum In anv shape."
'"I 'am .-i liar. Zella. The night I first
saw 'you I drank whisky with Joe Wil
liams."
"To talk me over. I suppose."
"Since that night I have registered an
oath in heaven. Zella; an oath sworn as
solemnly as I shall swear to . love and
cherish youâ an oath that It will be as
sweet to make as it will be to keop."
"You are .iust real grit. Ned." she sniil.
with a lavsrh; anÂ«l even at that moment
it struck Ned as curious that she should
every now and then speak with a dialect,
and make n mispronunciation, and yet
look like a lady, possess the instinct? of a.
lady, ami the distinction of a cultured in
telligence. .
"You remind me." Zoll;i went nn. "of the
fellow in Tennyson's poem, who beat h's
wife, and then crot ashamed nnd swore off:
hoi?tcd a bottle of gin on the shelf, his
favorite liquor: kept It tliere p.s a tri

turned out a real white man. both to his
wife and everybody else. Xed Glover. I
believe you are made that way."
"And the non-recorded reception of I.or-1

"No. Let us forget it. It might have

"But lonk here. Zella, you knowâ you

"Must really, you 'know, what, you

for his. friendship. If, she nad suspected
the. depth of his love for her she would
not have remained In his service. It is
not given to man, not even to the histo
rian, the novelist, the poet or the psychol-*
ogist. to probe the secret that a woman
chooses to hide in her heart. It is there
fore impossible to say to what extent
Zella Brunnen may have appreciated the
real state of Hiram Dexter's feeling.
That she may at le'ast have been vaguely
conscious of It is not unlikely, seeing. that
she had given Hiram 'reason to under
stand 'that any declaration to her- of -a
certain tender sentiment on his part
would end their association at thei Pal
mer House. Furthermore, the fact i that
she would accept no favors from him, not
even a present for extra work, was a kind
of intimation that their relationship must
be of a severely businesslike character.
He paid her. a fair .salary; she earned the
money.
AH this was very well until Mr. Ed
mund Glover made his ; appearance;, but
when his friend Storey ventured to hint
that, there might be a new candidate for
the employment of his pretty typist.' he

and when Glover went to live in 'the 'same

his cheeks and let loose in him passions
that had. hitherto lain dormant. Jeal-'
ousy had found out the savage that lurk

a s.ivape's cunning.
"You bate this Englishman; this news

passed the bottle to Abner Dlgges.

car of .Â¦ the Missouri Pacific Railroad,
bound for: Kansas'âCity, where Digges
would connect with the Atchison, Topeka

to a Red . House Forks, [ and - thence by
coach, and finally on horseback to Platts
.Valley and Blind. Man's,. Drift, which, as
we; already know, 'promised' to become
one of the most prosperous of the* Platts

that he had gone to Pittsburgh â¢

'"Hell as like. He'll know I won't a' for

said -Hiram. . . Â¦
"What's he Â¦' done to you?"
"Everything! Kverythlng! The infernal.
Interloping. 1 ungrateful sneak!" Hiram re
pli-* 1 - clenching liU bands.
Digges responded, with an effort at a
friendly smile, in which operation the
curre of his mouth dragged downward
instead of rising, and the effect was not
a success. He made up for It. however,
by waving his heavy hand from the plat
form of the car. Observing that Dexter
did not turn his head, he muttered a
coarse benediction on his new "pard.
and took his seat once more by the side
of the bottle of Old Rye that Dexter had
intioduced for his especial comfort and
satisfaction.
Dexter hurried from the track to find
his train for Chicago; never looked back,
felf faint, and crept into a corner of the
first car that came in his way.
"For Chicago?" he said, as the guard
came along-. ' â¢
"Why. certainly, Mr. Dexter, sir." he
replied. . . ..,,
"Thank you," said Dexter, huddling
himself together and closing his eyes.
i "Not well. I guess," said tne guard to
himself. "Money ain't everything, jt

ured pile, and another a casual dollar.
In due course the engine rang its bell,
and the cars, lumbering out of the depot,
were soon spinning along to Chicago,
where Ned Glover and his sweetheart, not
to mention Mrs. O'Hagan. had spent a
very happy day, and. after a good supper,
were talking It over, what time Hiram

"AND JEALOUSY WICKED :AT;murv

Hiram Dexter was a changed man. I Ev- â¢
erybody noticed it, and wondered what
was the, matter with him. From a genial
pleasant, generous fellow he had suddenly
become morose, pessimistic and inhospita
ble. '. . . He had allowed ' himself to
drift, seriously, and hopelessly, in lore
with Zella Brunnen. So long < o$\ he had ;
no rival he was content to assume a fath- ' ;
erly., Interest in her. knowing by ; Instinct <
and experiment that she '.-would " tolerate 'Â¦
no warmer passion. She regarded him as 'Â¦
generous, white man. upright lit all nls
dealings, charitable, famous among finan
ciers, a citizen of whom New York was
proud, and whom , Chicago delighted . to
honor, cheek by: Jowl with a ruffian who

"Be;my friend." said Dexter.
"Hnnor!d! Does me proud! Lend me ten

"If you had told me then that you were

"I don't regret. I never felt so happv

Itâ the problem of ir.nrriage, the union
of a man and a woman, a tremendous
sacrifice on the woman's part; a new llfo
that may be a heaven upon earth, or a
very hell."
She looked Into his face with her pas
sionate, searching eyes.
He held her hand. There seemed to him
for a moment a rebuke In her question
ing of the future.
"I don't know much about it. Ned. My
mother died when I was too young to
remember her. Eut I have heard that my
father, whom I loved devotedly, was to
her an overbearing, masterful partner. It
might well be. He was a soldier of the
6trong. dominant type, not only a leader
of men. but a commander: brave to reck
lessness; with no love, they said, for any
one but me, his only child. And, oh! to
me he was the gentlest, the sweetest, the
most lovable father, friend, companion,
everything. I rode by his side on an Irt
dian pony often, even when he was recon
noitering the position of the enemy; an
enemy to fall into whose hands was worse
than twenty deaths, the possible horrors
of which for a young girl I had never
understood or dreamed of. Whenever I
have thought of marriage I have felt that
to give nriy love to any other man wr>u]<V
be a kind of sacrilege. And, oh, Ned, I
continually feel sorelv perplexed!"
"My darling." paid Ned. "I welcome this
seriousness that hns come over you. It is
an earnest of your lovÂ«Â» for me, and it
makes the gift of it all the more pre
cious."
**I don't think I like your going away,
even for a few week*. How Ions before
you return, do you think?"
"All being well, and the enterprise tak

to come back to you for good, or to fetch
you to Denver or Colorado Springs per

"FOR HE WAS POSSESSED OB* A
DEVIL."
Hiram Dexter's dreaming seemed to last
â¢11 night. It continued the next day. Nor
did he sleep much on the night following.
The truth la a demon possessed him
There could be no other explanation of
his transformation from a penlal egotist
to a cynic with homicidal Impulses
Storey said Dexter's complaint was
liver. You had only to look at his eyes
to be convinced of that. His eyes wera
yellow where they should be white. His
skin had become dry and parched. H!a
clothes no longer tltted him. When he
was conversational with a man he no
longer looked him In the face. His hair,
which was wont to be smooth and used to
be nicely brushed, had become dry and ob
streperous. The demon drove htm Into a
hurried footstep. He seemed to be look
ing on all sides of the street at once. Ha
would not consult a doctor: but Storey's
favorite physician said he had had a con
gested mind, as well as a congested liver.
Whenever anyone hinted that he did not
look welt he smiled In a cunning kind of
way and said he was glad he didn't carry
a "chestnut bell." as he would have to
be ringing it all the time. The only two
persons with whom he was patient, and
to whose prescriptions of change and rest
he listened with attention, were his typist
secretary and the young fellow to whom.
It was said, she was engaged to bÂ« mar
ried. Dexter was always at leisure to re
ceive Mr. Edmund Glover. There was
nothing hÂ« would not do for him. It waÂ«
said, indeed, that he had made him his
heir: and the comment of those who knew
the parties well was that the young Eng
lishman would not have long to wait for
his enormous inheritance.
But this was the cunning of the demon
that had slipped Into the body and soul
of the millionaire. HJram Dexter. Surely
there must be such phenomena as that so
much insisted upon in the Scriptures; for
here was a man who had fought his way
through life to an honorable and prosper
ous positionâ a man of feeling. If not a
man of sentiment; a man with never a
blot upon his character; rich, yet beloved
of many; a speculator whom nobody
culled thief; a man of men among finan
ciers, using his wealth with a generous
. hand; a philanthropist, the founder of
- schools and public libraries, a trifle vul
gar, a trifle plebeian in his manners, per
haps, but a man of fine impulses and hon
â¢ est emotions, changed almost In a week,
ami in four entirely metamorphosed.
Zella and Ned Glover were sympathetic
enough to the poor old fellow; but they
were too much occupied with their happi
ness to pay anything like an exaggerated
attention to hla Indisposition.
Thf days had inarched on Into week3.
the weeks had brought summer, and the
mellowing sun of the autumn had smiled
upon Glover's suit. Zella had consented
to become his wife immediately on his re
turn from Platte Valley. Dexter had ex
tended a kind -of benevolent approval of
the arrangement. Storey had doubled
Ned's salary, and allowed him carts
blanche in regard to any. expenses h*
might consider necessary in the exploit
ing of the new region in the columns of
the Mall. At the same time, if he found
,lt more to his interest to take hold of tha
mining business and make the newspaper
a secondary consideration he had Storey's
permission to do what he thought best tor
himself.

THE SUNDAY CALL.
Major Hovey 'came up from Skagua^. A
potlach literally means "a. giving fr^ast":
but It Is more. It Is a "jag" of generosity.
Imagine President McKlnley or I-ord Sal
isbury gathering some 4000 of their friends
about them and collecting all the moneya.
securities, stocks and cash that they pos-<
sessecl, giving a banquet at which, after
a cotillon, they would give "all their world
ly goods awayâ a bunch of mining stocks
to one. a parcel of consols to another, and
so on. That is what an Indian potlach
would be if paralleled by the custom of
the white men.
Kodawatt has been saving for two years
for this great potlach, which we have Just
s'-en. lie had amassed $3009. which to
the Indian parallels him with the white
millionaire, and now, as the fires die out
on the beach and visitors are embarking
in their canoes, he is practically a pauper.
The gathered Indians were indeed a pic
turesque crowd.
They came dressed as usual in Ameri
can clothesâ the kind of clothes they col
lect in trade and begging and stealing. A
tennis suit with a silk hat is good form
among the si washes, and a, swallow-tail
with yachting cap is still more swagger.
When the potlach begins, paint and feath
ers are added to these costumes and there
Is the correct thing for you.
Some .wore huge masks representing
birds and beasts and cloaks of 1 feathers,
giving them the supposed appearance of
animals or birds; others smeared their
faces with red clay, with' stolen paint or
with stove polish.. These were the dancers
and "hamatsu," or medicine men.* Â¦ All
A 'cannon was fired and as the canoes
swung in to the beach and were. hauled
up the visitors were warmly welcomed.
They were led to the large huts, where
circled around the sides sat the klooteh
men and in a closer circle were the
braves.* â¢ Suddenly as the visiting Indians
marched around like the dancers at the
opening of a white man's ball, a weird
shriek resounded through the hut and
then came a number of answering yells
from behind many blankets strung like
an amateur theatric curtain at the end of
the -hut. Old â¢ Kodawatt marched' slowly
and solemnly upthV hall and cutthe cord
In which the blankets were suspended.
Down they came in a heap and thereon
a rude ptetf orm were two dozen Chilkat
dancers. The yells which inaugurated the
The prompt guests had been , lounging
about the beach all dav waiting for the
Sitkas. 'At last as. evening fell a runner
came along the beach announcing the
coming of the belated canoes. They were
Just around the bend, in many boats, said
the runner. Then they hove around the
bank, ten long canoes resplendent with
color. There were from a score to thirty
people in each boat, and. each was clad In
Ilia or her best shawl, blanket and leg
gings. " Some had maces carved like
totems and others- carried staffs huns;

dance had subsiaea into a guttural mono
tone of "Ohs" and "Ahs," and the assem
bled guests chanted dirge-like ad the
dance wont on. Squaws mechanically beat
tom-toms and more prosaic tin cans. The
Indian dance Is not graceful to the white
observer. It seoms to be a rhythmic hop
ping and jumping from one foot to the
other until exhaustion compels the danc
ers to subside.
As the dance went on messengers from
time to time came in arfd announced the
coming of the Invited chiefs, for it is the
style in Indian society, for menof rank
to attend the feasts late. Each person's
place is duly, reserved and he is escorted
to it. As the chiefs entered they were
cheered according to their popularity.
.The- food Is not served until all the in
,vited .ones arrive.
' The Chilkat dancers, having finished the
gyrations, the different totems â each fam
ily has a separate totem â took turns at
entertaining. The Sitkas had planned
something out of the ordinary. Amtyl the
yells of the assembled slwashea. they be
gan the war dance. It consists of a num
ber of Â¦ Indians- running to and fro, now
and then Jumping on one leg. Jingling
bell-hung spears, yelling and firing guns.
The men and women do not dance to
gether. The men dance while the women
chant and beat time.
Gradually the frenzy of the dancers In
creased, and then came the now seldom
seen Tamanamass dance, the devil dance
of the old midwinter feasts. Then came
one in which so realistic was the acting
that the troops Interfered, and the officer

the beginning of the feast. The ever bois
terous young bucks were daily becoming
more boisterous, and the hootchinoo was
being consumed. There were several
minor cutting affrays. Truly, the Indian
spirit was working up. Because of the
licisterousnes? ther* were other visitors
for the potlach. The colored troops of
wÂ«>rÂ» the Romans and the women of the

binrs. 3hc squaws and children were car
ried away and made slave-3. This is the
ivason that there Is a f*-ud between the
Chilkat*. Hoonahs and Sitkas and Wran
gÂ»ls. The fighting fore* of the Wrangels
was 50 decimated by this massacre that it
ha_* not recovered to this day. and has,
therefore, been unable to retaliate.
The massacre was the culmination of a
long war. In which the great flotillas of
canoes had fought at sea. villages had
hocn surprised and land battle3 fought.
Thousands of lives lost, for the to

for over a century, and he wanted to
make peare amorg tbe tribes, but. like the
White Czar, this Jndlan Nicholas has
failed.
It was a great potlach, but sad to say
failed of its Intended object. The pot
lach was. however, given a historical sig
nificance, owing to a meeting held a
couple of weeks prior between thÂ«Â» Indiana
and Governor Brady at Haines. The Gov
ernor had addressed the Indians. Impress

great extravagance and Â¦ superstitious

Long cords were tied to his pinioned

wild dancer's back. He plunged forward
as though in search of shelter. Another
stroke of the dagger was given and the
blood flowed freely down the victim's
back. Surely it was time to Interfere and

It locked like a tragedy until, with a
roar of laughter, the darky soldier sent

The killing had been a make-believe one.
Hidden under the cloak of the dancer
were long- strings of kelp, and these were
filled with "blood" made of a mixture of
red gum, rosin oil and water, which la
used for coloring the inside of canoes.
This was the piece de resistance, and now
the crowd was in a- frenzy. â¢
All night they danced, and In the early
morning came the potlach proper. Stand
ing on a platform behind a great pile of
blankets was the old chief. Kodawatt. and
near by was Sub-chief George Shortrldge.
Some of the b'anketsr-there were thou

of American woolen mills. There was also
a pile of white cotton and a miscellaneous
heap of other goods, trom pilot bread to
cases of boots. This 13 the event of the
potlach feast. Kodawatt, chief of all the
Chllkats. was about to pay some long
standing- debts to his tribesmen and give
presents to his guest* from other reserva
tions. From the proud position of a well
to-do chief he was to suddenly drop to
: that of a poverty stricken and consump
tive old chief, with the memory of having
given the last of .the potlaches to cheer
him as he passed on to the grave. As he
stood on- this platform in front of his
lodjre Kodawatt was welcomed with a
loud chant, in which were mingled the
cries of animals, the tribal cries of the

room and hear stories 'from the Bible, and
then they all sing at the tops of their.lit
tle voices. Some are in tune and some
are out; but nobody cares. If they get
more pleasure than you who listen, It is
because you are more fastidious than
waxm-hearted, and Â¦ you may sro back to
your old Wagner, where you belong. â¢,
If the Sunday is pleasant the children
take \ a walk. All through the week they
look; forward to the songs, and the walk
of Sunday, and when Monday morning
comes again they begin to look forward to
the next one.

she confided in her mother.
Then her mother went to the man and
asked why he didn't provide for his wife.

There are those who not only demand
second place for the bustard, but are In
clined to give to him first place among
the birds that fly. Even such an emi
nent authority as J. E. Harting of Lon
don seems to incline that way. But the
biggest bustard Mr. Harting cites Is the
Seville bustard, with a weight of thirty
pounds, and the biggest authentic spread
of wings he cites is only seven feet three
inches. The German naturalist, the
younger Naumann. tells of bustards
weighing thirty-two pounds, and says
that he ha3 been assured of the former
existence of specimens of the bird weigh
ing thirty-five or thirty-eight pounds.
theory is that the tnrkey navned himself
by his peculiar "cluck," which, sounds
like "turk. turk, turk."
The turkey, however, while he has the
weight, lacks the lirimense spread of wing
which birds of the eagle tribe have, and
this gives the harpy ejigle an advantage
In the competition. Until the recent dis
covery of the harpy eagle in- the Philip
pines it was. supposed that It existed no
where except in South America. ! with a
related form in New Guinea. There is a
splendid specimen of the harpy eagle in
the Washington Zoological Park which
weighs between 28 and SO pounds. When
it is considered that the gold eagle weighs
only 12 pounds, the sea eagle only 16
pounds and the Spanish imperial eagle
only a little over 10 pounds, it will be
seen that the harpy undoubtedly is en
titled to be considered the largest of
eagles, if not the second largest of fly-
Ing birds. No measurements which can
be accepted as scientific records have
been taken by the ornithologists of the
length of body and spread of wing of this
great and fierce bird, but It is estab
lished that the bird has c spread of at
least 10 to 12 feet.

two ( i-.^er-.tiu'-s hc.s made the exact choice
for second, third and fourth place a mat

question abo;:t thÂ« choice for first place.
The condor is kir.g.
In the United States we have, besides
the turkey, four other birds which are
ranked high in the list cf the largest fly
ing birds. They are the beautiful golden
eagle, the national bald-headed eagle, the
great wild swan known specifically as the
Whoopcr, and the California condor,
which is almost aa large as . his South
American brother.
In many respects the South American
condor Is the most remarkable of all liv-
Jr.g creatures. N'o other bird can fly so
high. HuznboMt saw one flying over
Ch'.rnbcrazo at a height of over 23,000 feet.
It scerr.s to fy as easily and breathe as
css'ly Jn the rarefied atmosphere at that
great height as it does at the level of tho
F*a. No other created being can do this,
x=.s no ether living creature can 15ft itself

Probably no other created animal -has
such keen sitrht as the condor. From tre
mendous heights and from great distances
it can spy a carcass and will swoop down
on it with the rush and speed of the wind
sweeping through the mountain gorges.
Though a good sized condor measures lif
teen feet in its expanse of wingâ condors
have been shot with that . spreadâ there
seems to be no authentic record of tne
weight of a condor that size. The weight
of the bird is estimated by good authori
ties, however, at about forty pounds for
one with a tlf teen-foot spread of wing. OM
travelers' tales tell of condor? with' an
eighteen-foot spread of wing, but there is
no authentic record of a bird having been
measured which comes up to those figure-.
Two fine specimens of this condor reached
the New York Zoological Society recently
and are Installed now in a . cage in th-j
Bronx-Park, New York. They are not
nearly full grown, but they are huge birds

In putting forward the claims of the
turkey to be the third largest bird that
flies, if not the second, the tame as well
as the wild bird must be taken Into con
sideration: for the domestic turkey cer
tainly can fly and sometimes ascends to
the "Upmost top of the tallmost tree,"
though he is not so lively on the wing
as his wild brother. /'The wild turkey,"
says William T. Hornaday of the New
York Zoological Gardens, ""Is the king of
game birds," and a faraway look comes
into his eyes as If he were thinking of
â¢his Thanksgiving dinner. There is a wild
turkey in the Zoological Gardens which
arrived there last springâ a beautiful
specimen. He weighs 2S pounds now and
is increasing. Domestic turkeys of 30
pounds are not uncommon, and Audubon
speaks of one which weighed 36 pounds.
Bonaparteâ not the great emperor, but his
brother L-ucien, Prince of Caninoâ In his
work on "American Ornithology," speaks
of turkeys weighing 40 pounds and re
gards all reports of larger birds as "fab
ulous"
cliffs descend sheer down for thousanc
Of feet. It wanders sometimes to where
the cliffs of Patagonia frown over the
troubled seas, but prefers to seek Its food
in the mountain valleys. It is a bird
blessed with an appetite as remarkable as
Itself, and one condor has been known to
devour a calf, a dog and a. sheep in a
single week. On the other hand, it can
go without food for more than forty days.
By preference the condor feeds on carrion,
but if no carrion offers It will not hesitato
to attack sbcep. soats or small deer.
The steinadler builds his rude nest on
the sides of ste"ep rocky walls so smooth
that not even the chamoi3 can gain a foot
hold on them. All sorts of tales are told
about him. So great is the awe in which
he Is held that the wildest stories find
ready credence even among the mountain
eers, because they know what a terrible
bird he is. The Swiss say that the stein
adler never drink3 water, but quenches
hi* thirst w ; ith blood only, and there aro
many stories of hunters who have been
hurled to their death by the determined
attacks 'of a bird which thought its nest
in danger.
An eagle which, though smaller than
any of those mentioned. 13 dreaded most
thoroughly, because of its fearlessness
and fierceness, is the savage and power
ful Alpine eagle, known In Switzerland as
the steinadler (stone eagle).
The laemmergcier, the great bearded
vulture of the Alps, 13 the bird told of
moÂ«=t frequently in song and story as a
kidnaper. As a matter of fact. It is doubt
ed by the best authorities if the laemner
gcier ever stoops to any but a carcass.
Nevertheless, there have been pretty well
established cases of its having carried off
young lambs and kids, and one has been
shot while eating a rabbit which it had
Ju3t killed. â¢ Yet one naturalist wba
watched the laemrnergeier for twelve
years never once saw the bird attack any
thing alive. The laemmergeier sometimes
weighs sixteen pounds and has a wing
expanse of over nine feet. It in thought
that the depredations of eagles have given
to the laemmergeier its bad, name by get
ting their exploits mixed up with his.
A harpy eagle could carry off a small
baby if it felt so disposed and the gohlt-n
e.agle can carry off a small fawn or kul
or a wild turkey, and does it when oppor
tunity offers. The latter sometimes weighs
twelve pounds and has an expanse of wtnjc
of seven feet and a half. It Is capable of
enduring extreme cold and is immensely
strong for its size. The prey which it
kills and carries off frequently exceeds
its weight. "With Its remarkable keenness
of vision It espies its prey from a great
height and falls upon It with tremendous
velocity and unerring precision. The bird
is common in this country, but seldom seen
in-the Eastern States. It lives to extreme

Is an authentic record of one living for
over a century in captivity. The American
eagle â that Â«is. the so-called bald-headed
eagle, which is not bald-headed at allâ is
a fish-eating bird generally, though it will
not disdain flesh, when It can get It, an<l
often attacks small quadrupeds and
smaller birds. Accor<1ing k to Audubon the
bald eagle can ascend until it disappears
from view, without any apparent motion
of Its wings of tall. It groves to be about
twelve pounds in weight.
In speaking of big flying birds, thfÂ» wild
swan should not be forgotten. This bird
sometimes attains to a weight of twenty
five pounds, and has an expanse of wins
of seven feet. The aibatross sometimes
weighs seventeen pounds and., has four
teen feet expanse of wing.

WAR'S HORRORS JUST BEGINNING
Letters From Boer Women Show the
Pitiful Distress Which Has Fol

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Nov. 17.â Kitchener has de
cided to depopulate several towns in the
Transvaal, owing to the difficulty of
handling the Boers, who are hampering
the civilian population.
Kitchener is now for the first time un
hampered in carrying on the South
African war and it promises to be widely
different than under Roberts. He has
faced the grim fact that the "enemy"
means the entire population and has
greatly tightened the censorship, while
he finds it necessary to carry out certain
military police acts j more suitable to a
campaign of sheer extermination and ag
pression than consistent with the policy
of ultimate conciliation and nelgHborli
ness. The Transvaal and the Orange
Free State are now opening the second
season, since a crop was sown and it is
fourteen months since the normal import
of foodstuffs ceased. The railways are
still broken for several days .weekly.
These things combined make the'feed
ing of the occupants of the two republics
a work of great difficulty; which is in
creased, by the finding of towns with
stores under garrison." ' These garrisons
the Inhabitants betray to commandos,
which thereby easily ' replenish their
store, thus making the starving
out of , the fighting burghers Im
possible.- "Kitchener's alternative is the
Weylerizatlon of the two republics by
means-of the depopulation of towns, mov
ing every non-military inhabitant toward
the coast, where they will be more easily
fed, while freeing the army's'hands. This
will Involve great time and labor and It is
doubtful If it' Is feasible. Kitchener's
movement shows the fearful desolation
to which the war has reduced the coun
tries.
The publication of letters from Boer
women showing the pitiful distress which
has followed the burning of farms is not
heeded here. The people will forgive any
thing which will bring the fighting to an
end and release the troops. Instead of
that, however, the Innlskilling Fuslleers,
who returned to England from Natal a
few months ago, have been ordered to re
embark for the Cape.
the conditions: these are In the hands of
the Mayor. He .says his letter -is In ac
cordance with Instructions laid on him by
the convention of the Episcopal church
of this diocese, and he leaves the matter
in the Mayor's hands.
Mayor Van Wyck at once replied to the
Bishop by a letter, in which he said he
passed the Bishop's communication to the
District Attorney, and then adds:
"I wish here to assure you that I will
exert every power which the law has
given to right the wrongs and to do away
with the conditions of which you com
plain and to secure a hearty and efficient
co-operation by the -Police Department
with all who are working to do away with
public violations of law and decency. I
stand ready at all times to assist and co
operate with you in this matter."
Mayor Van Wvck's letter to the Dis
trict Attorney requests him to co-operat*
with Bishop Potter and the Police Depart
ment in the movement. In a letter to tus
Board of Police Commissioners the Mayor
Incloses a copy- of the Bishop's letter and
directs the commissioners to at once con
duct a searching investigation into the
duct of the two police officials who. the
Bishop says, insulted the Clergyman. He,
also directs them to do away with the

Protests to Mayor Van Wyek: Against Insults
Offered Clergymen When They Seek to Pro
mote Virtue' and Order* in the Community.
NEW YORK. Nov. 17.-PIans are now
being perfected for a general con
ference of all societies that have
during the last few years been en
fie&vcring to Etamp out vice and crime In
New York. The details have not been ar
rar.ged, but It seems to be the general
visa that there should be a foregather
ing of those who are in earnest in their
desire to purify the city. When this con
ference is held no representation will be
allowed the recently formed Tammany
vt ce committee. Among those who have
been persistent in their efforts to achieve
xtform no one can be found who places
Bay reliance on the Integrity of purpose
of those who have been named by Tam
many to drive vice from the lower East
Side. At the same time Bishop Potter
end the clergy generally are waiting for
the members of the Tammany committee
to Indicate their line of action before crit
icism Is passed.
Poolrooms and gambling houses were in
full blast In all parts of the city to-day.
In the lower East SidÂ© resorts of vice,
concerning which so much complaint has
Leen made, were wide open, the police as
J et having made no move against them.
President York of the Police Board ad
dressed the Brooklyn police captains, as-
Buring them that the present crusade was
intended earnestly.. He told them that
gambling must be prevented in Brooklyn
find that their own interests demanded
that they be kept as clean as possible.
President York attempted to have a
meeting of the Police Board, but was not
successful In getting a Quorum. A ses
eion wUl bÂ© held on Monday, when
diarges may be preferred against In
epector Cross and Captain Herllhy.
The first gun in the anti-vice and anti-
Tammany campaign was fired by Bishop
Henry C. Potter of the Protestant Epis
copal Diocese of New York, who sent a
letter to Mayor Van Wyck in reference to
vice In this city, and especially on the
East Side. This letter is the one prom
ised seine weeks ago. when the Bishop
publicly announced that one of his rec
tors had been grossly insulted by the
commanding officials of a certain police
eiatlon, and that he proposed to take up
the matter In a manner which the heads
of the police force should feel.
Bishop Potter first calls attention to the
Â¦work that is being done at the pro-cathe-
Crai. 130 Stantoa street, in endeavoring to
Improve the condition of the poor of the
East Side tenement district. In which It 'r
located, and says it has been recognized
as an Important factor In promoting the
virtue and good order of the community
in â¢which It ministers. He goes on to tell
bow. when the clergymen called at the
police station of the precinct to complain
cf tilÂ© notorious condition of affairs, one
cf them was told by the police captain
that he lied, and that when, disheartened
by such an experience, the clergyman car
ried his complaint to a higher authority
In the police, he was met with insolent de
rision. The Bishop continues:
"I am not, I beg to say, unmindful of
the fact that the existence of vice in a
great city Is practically an inevitable con
dition of the life of such a community. I
am not demanding that vice shall be
'ftamped out* by the police or any other
civil authority. This Is a task which
would demand for Its achievement a race
of angels and not of men. But I approach
you, sir, to protest with all my power
â¢gainst a. condition of things In which vice
Is not only tolerated, but shielded and en
couraged, by those whose sworn duty it
Is to repress and discourage It, and. In
the name of unsullied youth and Inno
cence, of young girls and their mothers,
who, though living under conditions often
cf privation and the hard struggle for
a. livelihood, have In them every Instinct
cf virtue and purity, that are the orna
ments of any so-called gentlewoman In
the land, and before God and in the face
of the citizens of New York, I protest, as
roy people have charged me to do, against
these habitual insults, the persistent'men
ace, the unutterably defiling contacts, to
which, day by day, because of the base
complicity of the police of New York with
the lowest forms of vice and crimes, they
fere subject.
"And In the name of these little ones,
the weak and defenseless little ones,
Christian and Hebrew alike, of many
races and tongues, but of homes where
Cod la feared and his law "reverenced and
virtue and decency honored and exempli
fied, I call upon you, sir, to save these
people, who are in a very real way com
mitted to your charge, from a living hell.
defiling, deadly, damning, to which the
criminal suplneness of the constituted au
thorities, set for tho defense of decencjr
and good order, threatens to doom them."
Bishop Potter, in conclusion, says he
has no methods to suggest for bettering

LONDON. Nov 17.â An entirely new de
parture in Arctic exploration will be made

wonderful ice ship, the Yermak, with in
struction* to cut her way through to the

cutting her way at three or four miles an
hour through immense ice fields In the
Baltic Sea. and other Russian waters have

and improved for the greatest of all
tasks.
The Armstrongs at ElBwlck have just
completed a new bow which is especially
designed to. encounter fields of ice In the
Arctic Sea, which are heavier and thicker
than any which the Termak has attacked.
The original bow was easily capable of
dealing with any : of the enormous ice
fields which Russia produces.. She went
to a high latitude on her trip last summer
and accomplished all that could 'be ex
pected of her in the assaults' upon the
eternal ice which she then encountered.
Alterations now being made were sug
gested by "this experience.'
Admiral Makaroff, who will command
the expedition and who is superintending
the changes, has the greatest confidence
that his ship will cut her way without de
lay straight to the pole and will return
safely In the same season. Every pre
caution has been taken to fit her out for
a long stay in case of accident or block
ade. Admiral Makaroff has refused to
give the details of the plans or even ad
mit that the expedition will be under
taken, but there is no doubt on this point.

MANILA, Nov. 17.â The army trans

and, carrying a "company of the
.. Twenty-second Infantry, has gone
ashore on the- rocks on the east side of
Isla de Pollllo. The Boldlers were des

The United States army transport Indi

port for the Government on October -27,
1S98, when she sailed for the Philippines
with the First and Second battalions of
the Kansas regiment on board, in com
mand of Brigadier General (then Colonel)
Funston.
The Indiana made a return trip to this
port with a large number of dead and
wounded soldiers, and after being refitted
was sent. again to Manila. For the last'
nine/months, on account of her large ton

GREECE IS
BETROTHED
â¢ T"^J ENVER, , Nov. 17.â Colorado' is
jl shuddering with horror over' the
_// burning of '"John" 'Porter .near
Lake station yesterdayâ that is,
- all of Colorado except -Lincoln
County. In Denver and Colorado Springs
meetings, of ministers , and business men
have been called to condemn the brutality
of the mob which burned Porter.
Lincoln County, j however, has no re
grets. R. -W. Frost is actually pleased
with his revence. He set- the match to
the pyre in which was consumed the negro
murderer of his little daughter at almost
the precise spot where the murder was
committed.'
"I have done nothing that I would not
do again," he said. ,
His neighbors went to-day to the scene
of the burning and built a fresh fire over
the little heap of blue bones that lay in
the ashes beside the steel stake to which
Porter was cKalned. When the bones were
wholly consumed the ashes were scattered
to the winds, away from the weeds dyed
with the blood of Louise Frost Her
father did not want the negro's dust to
defile 'the spot where his child had been
found dying.
The Coroner's jury visited the. spot soon
afterward, and In ten minutes reached a
verdict that Porter "came, to his death at
the hands of persons unknown to tVie
jury.";
I Porter was one of the many low negroes
.brought in to work on section gangs.
Warning, was sent out by the lynchers to
all these negroes' to get out of the State,
and to-day, there Is not a black working
on the'Union Pacific sections. west of the
Kansas line. A few of the sightseers from
.Denver and other Colorado and Kansas
towns have con;e home from the burning
;with bits of bones picked from the fire,
but relic hunting .was sternly discouraged
by the farmers, who executed Porter as a
matter of duty. The Bible which Porter
carried in his walk to his death- was dis
played in Denver to-day.
j A meeting will be heid In the First Bap
tist Church here to-morrow afternoon to
pass resolutions condemning. the lynching.
The leading pastors of the city will speak
and many sermons will be preached on the
subject to-morrow. The Governor - has
promised to make a speech, and business
men and lawyers, many of whom would
have heard without a qualm that. the ne
gro had been hanged, will denounce hla
burning.
â¢ One probable effect of the lynching will
be. the repeal of the law forbidding capital
punishment in- Colorado. Many who con
demn tho lynching say it would not have
occurred if the people could have been
sure that the negro would be hanged. The
free exercise of the pardoning power by
Colorado's Governor, particularly In the
cases of murderers, has aroused a strong
sentiment In favor of the return to the
old law. .A strong lobby for' the repeal bill
was at work long before the Porter lynch
ing, and it now has an argument which
.will appeal to everybody In the State, for
even District Attorney Malone, who con
demned the lynching/ when pressed with
questions said: . .
"If I had been Frost and my little girl
had been murdered I should have shot
that scoundrel full of holes."
Therein he. expressed the sentiment of a.

RILLS HIS
WIFE AT HER
LOVER'S DOOR
Paris Shocked ljy Crime
of the Count de
Cornulier.
Countess Murdered as She Is About
to Enter the Apartments of
M. Le Coux.
PARIS, Nov. 17.â Count de Cornulier this
afternoon surprised his wife, the Countess
de Cornulier, visiting the apartments of
a gentleman on the Rue de Provence. The
Count met the Countess on tho stairway
and fired three shots at her. She died on
her way to a hospital. The Count was
arrested.
Ths family is a prominent one. The
Countess' brother is an.army colonel- and
the Count is widely known in the highest
Parisian society. He is* ii years of age.
His wife was il years old. She was for
merly Mile. Gentivieve Beneau de Vien
nay. A. suit for separation was pending
between the Count and Countess.
The shooting of the Countess de Cornu
licr created consternation in social cir
cles, where both the Count and Countess
were prominent. The Countess was a
woman of unusual beauty, and she was
often seen at the theaters, racecourses
and other, resorts frequented by the elite
of Paris. She was a daughter of Count
de Vianney. whose family is highly re
spected. She was married to Count
Charles de Cornulier fourteen years ago,
and three children are the result of the
union.
7"he marriage proved unhappy, and act
ing upon the advice of her father the
Countess separated from her husband
four years ago and had since lived in a
private home at Auteuil.
Recently a. decree was rendered piving
her possession of the children. Tho Count
began es-pionage and discovered that the
CountPES frequently visited M. Le Coux,
One of her former admirers. Count de
Corrni! ier claimed that a liaison was main
tained between the couple, but the best
information is that M. Le Coux acted as
the legal adviser of the Countess. It is
stated that her father chose him to man
ape her affairs.
Yesterday the Count watched M. Le
Coux's home, but the Countess did not
pay a visit to her adviser. To-day, find

moned to take her to the hospital. The
Count was exceedingly calm upon Eur
lenderinp himself. Faying: fc
"I did it. I am her husband."
The Duke and Duchess of. York's forth
coming visit to Australia is quite likely to
bÂ« finished with a trip through Canada.
Additional excursions will be made in the
United States. .
Another royal rumor is the engagement
of Prince George of Greece, who is now
here, to one of the English. Princesses, to
which the Queen is said to have given her
approval.
Another, curious piece of information on
American matters is contained in the Don
don Dally Telegraph's description of so
ciety among women of London, in which
It is trravely aserted that "when an Amer
ican has made a fortune he finds it almost
impossible to live quietly in his own coun
try. The chief attraction is England,
where Americans can escape the news
panerp."
This Is the chief reason, according to the
Daily Telegraph, why the American col
ony in London increases, though it admits
that many love to come here for the sake
of the country alone and "because it
makes them feel like being on a visit to
their grandmother's home, where every
thing is dignified, proper and nice."
"The- reputation of Americans of a cer
tain type for vulgar ostentation seems to
have been exceedingly well sustained at
the weflding," and eo on in a similar
strain. â¢ â¢ â¢ .â¢
The British specials giving descriptions
of the Morsran-Satterlee weddng are al
most entirely devoted to its pecuniary fea
tures, jriving the impression that it was
a repetition of the Bradley-Martin ball.
As a natural result the London papers In
dulge in such comment as this from the
Westminster Gazette:
Alfred Harmsworth and his wife will
pail for America in December. It -has been
freely said he.re that his mlesion'is to start
a Daily Mail in New York, being con
vinced that a large amount of money can
be made out of such a paper there. The
report. however, is unfounded. Mr.
Harmsworth Is going acrops the Atlantic
for a holiday. He will spend most of his
time fishing In California.
"There Is no truth In It. My pork busi
ness is progressing quite satisfactorily.
Moreover, the Chicago dealers are much
too good friends of mine to attempt to
take 'revenge.* That word is used unjust
ly, for I 'have done nothing for which
'revenge' is needed."
When questioned regarding the cable
report that the Chicago packers were get
ting their revenge for the Lipton pork
deal by "squeezing" him. Sir Thomas
9aid:
"I prefer Sandy Hook. I do not think
that there Is a better course in the world.
1 have never made any objection to itâ
in fact, I have always spoken of it in the
highest terms. No doubt the races last
year were prolonged owing to there not
being sufficient wind to finish with in the
time limit. But it is my opinion that with
sufficient wind there could not be a better
or fairer course, and personally I feel that
there would be more glory in fighting the
battle on the old historical course, where
we have so often been defeated. Anyhow
there has always been sufficient breeze
for the American boats to win at Sandy
Hook, and had the Shamrock been . a
speedier boat the same wind would have
brought her in first. Were I to go over a
new course I could not have worse luck,
so far as results pro, than I hud at Sandy
Hook, and the Americans could not have
better luck than' they got there. These
are my personal views. The members of
ihe New York Yacht Club are certainly
tho best judges, and I am quite willing to
abide by their decision."
One of the most serious questions of the
week has been church matters. The
f-rchbifchops and bishops met in solemn
conclave to consider privately many con
troversial matters, the chief of which was
"whether the ritualist clergymen refusing
to obey the Al.chbfs'hop's command should
be prosecuted. As a result of the delib
erations it Is probable. that the obstinate
ritualists will be allowed to pursue the
even tenor of their way, for the Kensit
party opposed prosecutions on the ground
that they were likely to retard legislation.
On the whole, the high churchmen were
naturally opposed to any civil interfer
ence. The decision averts, at least tem
porarily, what threatened to be a crisis
in the history of the Church of England.
The controversy in the United States
regarding the proposed change of the
America's cup course from off Sandy
Hook to off Newport can be settled in
only one way, according to Sir Thomas
Llpton's idea, and that is by sticking to
the old order of things. He said:
The lirst meeting of Parliament prom
ises to be short and is likely to be ad
journed over the new year as soon as the
necessary supplies are secured.
It is Lord Rosebery's counteraction of
those features which makes his words so
deeply weighed by politicians and busi
ness men tn Great Britain. With con
summate skill he presents both 'the weak
ness and strength of imperialism. A cor
respondent, describing Lord Rosebery's
speech at Glasgow, cays:
"His aloofness from the crowd and un
fathomed loneliness were in striking con
trast to that passionate interest in the
public business by the nation."
Yet, with all this adulation of his coun
trymen, bestowed regardless of : party
lines, it seems unlikely that the former*
Liberal Premier will emerge from his poli
tical retirementâ at any rate, at present.
His great antagonist. Lord Salisbury, has
decided quite unexpectedly to call an
early session of Parliament and has con
sented to accept a salary of Â£2000 for ful
filling his duties as Premier, though nom
inally he receives a recompense for so do
ing', for the Lord of the Privy Seal emol
uments which were abolished in 1S84 are
his. Lord Salisbury personally was not
anxious to receive any pay, but it was
thought to be a bad precedent for a Cab
inet Minister to work for nothing, so the
salary <Â£5oOO) of Lord of the Privy Seal
was revived, and is now his.
"Now that two nations at least, the
United States arid Germany, are so
closely at our back that their shadow
falls in front of us, and that they are In
a more able condition than ourselves, we
have no doubt England has a reserve pace
which our competitors scarcely suspect.
But we are near the time when we will
have to put forth the best of our speed
and stretch every fiber."
LONDON, Nov. 17.â The increasing fre
quency of Lord Rosebery's public utter
ances In no way decreases the thrill of
admiration and fascination which follows
on each occasion. The strange mingling
of common-sense, sentiment, surpassing
rhetoric and homely, phrases puzzles' the
people of Great Britain to such an extent
that the former Premier may well be
said to have gained more power since liÂ«
has been out of power than he ever did
before. His speech at Glasgow yester
day on: the occasion of his installation as
Lord Rector of the Glasgow University
causes the other events of the week to
tink into insignificance. Yet, the under
lying note of that wonderful monograph
of the British empire was one of warn
ing, as the Daily Telegraph appropriately
describes it, as follows: . -

Parliament, whose fears have been
aroused by the depopulation of France,
has just introduced a bill directed against
bachelors. ' Not satisfied with proposing
rewards for large families, this honorable
Deputy desires to levy fines in the shape
of special taxes on those married people
whose union has remained barren, and
upon the single of both sexes. Here a
distinction Beems necessary, if we would
be Just. As the subject lends itself to
facile jokes, Parisian wit has been at no
loss to point out, and that in a fashion at
times somewhat light, the injustice of
a proposal which assimilates In punish
ment the celibacy of man, which is nearly
always of his own volition, to the celi
bacy of woman, which in the greatest
number of cases Is altogether involuntary.
If the bill is passed it will certainly be
amended in this sense. Skeptics, how
ever, have little faith in its efficacy. The
nuisance of paying 20 or even 50 francs
in an annual "tax will not, according to
their theory, be held by ingrained bach
elors to counterbalance the expenses of
a household or the inconveniences of a
short-tempered mother-ln-Iaw.

Rush of Foreign Diplomats to Con

Escape From Death.
. BERLIN, Nov. 17.â The attempt upon
the life of Emperor William, the opening
of the Reichstag and the new situation
created in China by the reported willing
ness of the United States to co-operate
forthwith with the powers' in China gave
plenty of food for discussion during the
wetk. *
The Emperor's would-be assassin, from
the latest reports, seems indeed to be de
mented. She was born at Larnowitz and
is a Pole by nationality. She earned a
living at Breslau as a peddler of woolen
socks. She had been in the habit of lock
ing herself in a room when at home, and
her neighbors had heard her mumbling
for hours. She had threatened to kill the
landlord if ejected. Yesterday, before
she raade the 'attempt upon the Kaiser,
ejectment proceedings had been taken
against her, and she had bargained with
a laborer for paving stones, which sho
wanted for the purpose of killing every
body. She subseqeuntly purchased the
new hatchet with which she attempted,
to kill the-Kmperor.
At the police inquiry to-day the woman
answered the questions put to her by say
ing:
"Everybody tries to murder me. There
fore I must murder the Kaiser."
All the heads of legations and embassies
iu Berlin called at the palace to-day to
express gratification at the escape of his
Majesty. The press to-day points out that
the crime is devoid of political feature.
The China situation is viewed here
rather without hope. The latest diplo
matic news from Peking emphasizes the
fact that there is no reliable information
there regarding the momentary intentions
of the Empress Dowager and the Em
peror, but the prevailing opinion among
the envoys there is that they do not in
tend to return to Peking. Regarding the
powers of Li Hung Chang and Prince
Ching for negotiating terms of settlement
there is the strongest doubt among the
envoys. \
The statements emanating from Wash
ington, that the United States will here
after act Jointly with the powers and
deprecating the -reported Intention to in
terpose obstacles to punitive expeditions,
are received here with unanimous satis
faction, a number of the papers pointing
out that, once the Chinese court under
stands that there is no split among the
powers, it will the more willingly give
them satisfaction. However, the attitude
assumed by the Russian press this week,
which is distinctly and violently hostile
toward Germany, arouses disquiet here.
SKELETONS

IN ALASKA
The Cologne Volks Zeitung, in an edi
torial article, calls tne diplomatic situa
tion regarding China dangerous, as evi
dence exists that there is an inclination
toward forming groups among the inter
ested powers. This view is borne out by
the fact that the French Bishop Favier,
at Peking-, has undertaken a trip to Rome
at the instance of the Pope, his Holiness
desiring to re-establish France's protec
torate over the . Catholic missions in
China. The Pope wants an express
clause. Information obtained from the
highest source, is to the effect that the
papal nuncio at Munich, Monsignor Sam
bucetti, is coming to Berlin to make
strong representation upon the subject to
Emperor William: Furthermore, it is
learned at the Japanese legation in Berlin
that Japan Intends to withdraw : her
troops from Peking at the earliest pos-.
sible moment, leaving only, an adequate

Ancient Cemetery
Uncovered in the
Atlin Gold
District.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
VANCOUVER, Nov. 17.â James L. Fer
kinson, an American miner of Atlin, ar
rived here to-day with news of the find
ing of a number of skeletons in an an
cient Indian cemetery in the north, which
is of startling scientific interest. Perkin
son is one of the owners of the Yellow
Ja cket, a . rich claim . which Is supposed
to be the fountain head of Pine, the prin
cipal creek in Atlin district. Two weeks
ago the first excavations were being made
for a new tunnel on the property and
w hat appears to have been an old Indian
burying ground was opened up.
Five skeletons, nearly complete, were
exhumed and each is the set of bones
that belonged to a giant of prehistoric
times. One of the skeletons measures over
si-ven feet in length, so that the man
must have been considerably over that
height. Then there were two others of
within an/Inch of seven feet and the re
maining two "were more than six feet in
length and the men were of gigantic
frame.
The altitude Is high and the ground was
half frozen, 80 that the bones were pre
scrvedalmoet intact Perkinson says that
.he expects if they had kept on digging
they would have found many more, as
these were lying comparatively close to
gether. The bones of the fingers and toes
bad crumbled away, but the linger of one
skeleton hand was sufficiently â¢ strong to
hold a ring of what appears to be lead or
some similar base, metal. The skeletons
were unsually well formed, but one unique
feature was that the arms were seveAl
inches shorter than ordinarily appears,
while the size of. the bones of the fore
arm was enormous in comparison to. the
usual models. , . :
Beside two of the skeletons were spears,
rudely shaped with a soft metal â¢ and
pointed with sharp stones. The spears
were only about three feet long and five'
Inches thick at the top. tapering at the
lower end. The top contained a socket
into which a wooden shaft was njobably
placed, in order to wield the big piece of
metal. Other pieces of stone and carved
metal were'.found.. The general physical
appearance of .the. skeletons, according to
the cursory examination of the miners,
was similar to that of the-Indlans of the
present day. They werÂ« certainly of the
nathead type of < the present .- northern
tribes. That the burying place Is of.an
cient origin' Is evidenced by/the fact that
the Indians say none of their tribesmen
have lived within flfty.,mlles of this place
as far backas stories have been handed
down. There are several ..mounds, pre
sumably made by the Indian^,' lrt the vi
cinity of the new mine tunnel , now being
extended. , ;. '..;.;â¢.

TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON. Nov. 17.-
In the Interest of the good relations be
tweÂ«n the United States and France Sec
retary of State John Hay is believed to
have taken action to dissipate .the feal
ing aroused in the latter country by the
publication of Information that the War
Department is In possession of the secret
of the French field gun mechanism. Pres
ident McKinley and his Cabinet advisers
heartily approve. the statement issued by
the American Embassador in Parla. but
they are disappointed that the effect has
not been more marked., "
In conversation with the President rep
resentative officials are inclined to speak
lightly of the incident, terming it "a tem
pest In a teapot." At the same. time tho
international feature of the" affair might
possibly assume a serious aspect and it
is to prevent any .such contingency, how-,
ever, remote, that the authorities are en
deavoring to impress the Paris Govern
ment with the fact that no agent of. the
United Slates secured -possession of the
plans of the gun. .
As The Call has stated Captain I. N.'
Lewis of the Sixth Artillery, recorder of
the. board of ordnance and fortifications.
while he was abroad last summer suc
ceeded in â¢ examining a' French field piece
and his technical ability- enabled him -to
draw plans which may be Identical with
those used In the construction of the gun.
but' which, in any : event, will permlf of
the manufacture of. a weapon expected to
give practically the same results.
No representations have been, made' to
the United States by the. French Govern
ment .regarding thei matter and the au
thorities publicly scout. the idea that the
American military and naval attaches in
Paris are. to be withdrawn In consequence
of the Incident. As a' matter of fact It U
stated that no one 1 connected with tha
embassy had | any knowledge of - Captain
Lewis' aotion. ' It: is pointed out that the
French, agents here receive the utmost
consideration compatible with the Intemt
of the country and it is asserted that Â¦" tho
American attaches in "Paris are no more
to blame than they are for the- acquisition
by the Government of the French secret.
Lieutenant General Miles, commanding,
proposes if â¢ possible to discover . the. per
son who. made, public -the announcement
that has caused the storm. . He has re
celved the reply of 'Brigadier General

ADVERTISEMENTS.SUTTON CONVICTED
OF MANSLAUGHTER
Attorneys Make Masterly Flea In
His Behalf, but Fail to Secure
a Verdict of Ac
quittal.
Special Dispatch to Tho Call.
COL.USA. Nov. 17.â The Jury in the case
of Jesse Sutton, accused of the murder of
John Clasby, to-night brought In a ver?
diet of guilty of manslaughter.
Arguments for the defense were made
by Attorneys Weyand and De Long this
morning. Mr. Weyand thoroughly re
viewed the case and was followed by his
associate, De Long, who held the atten
tion of the Jury for fully an hour.
Mr. de Long dwelt at length upon the
honor of a home and the right of a hus
band to protect his wife and family from
a future of disgrace and shame. In
marrying 1 a woman a man registers a
vow to love, honor and protect her and lt
was in the fulfillment of that obligation
that the defendant shot and killed John
Clasby. Jesse Sutton, said the attorney,
was a poor man and was compelled to
work for other people and it was while
he was away he was robbed of his wife's
affections and a stigma placed on the
name of his little children. Ha asked
the Jurv to stop and think what they
would have done under like circum
stances; what would have been the effect
upon their minds lf told by one of their
children of the actions of a man like John
Clasby.
After the noon recess Attorney Edwin
Swlneford closed the case for the people
in a masterly address. Judge Albery
read his Instructions to the Jury, which
retired at 4:25 p. m. and at 8:40 p. m. ren
dered the verdict of manslaughter.
STRENGTHENING FORTS
ON PTJOET SOUND
Six Strategic Points to Be Manned
and Equipped With Guns of
Large Caliber.
SEATTLE, Wash., Nov. 17.â Th*-War
Department Is quietly pressing work on
the fortifications on Puget Sound. At
least six strategic points are to be manned
and fully equipped with guns of large
caliber. The Government has already ex
pended $1,500,000 in building and equipping
the forts at the entrance to the Sound.
Of this amount 5750,000 was expended in
constructing the battery emplacements.
The Indications are now that at least
$500,000, lf not more, will be spent by the
Government in fortifications on the Sound
during the ensuing year. Forts Worden.
Flsgler and Casey are the three points of
an almost impregnable triangle off Port
Townsend harbor at the entranca to tha
Sound. There are two mortar batteries
of sixteen guns each, besides a number
of ten and twelve inch guns, distributed
between Forts Casey and Flagler. At
least one additional battery of sixteen
mortars will be put In next year and six
S-lnch and six 10-lnch guns will be added
to the present armament of each fort.
Plans have already been drawn at
Washington for the new battery emplace
ments, which work will be started at the
beginning of 1901. After building addi
tional emplacements and installing new
guns at the entrance to Puget Sound the
engineering department will complete the
fort at the entrance to the Port Orchard
naval station. Three guns have already
been installed at Port Orchard. Fort
Lawton. near Seattle, and Point Defiance,
near Tacoma.- will be the next important
points to be fortified by the Government.
There are now two 8-inch and four 10
inch cannon in the local freight yards
awaiting shipment to Port Townsend.

FRAIL WOMAN
FEARS HUSBAHD
WILL KILL HER
Possesses a Secret Which
Would Send Him to
Prison.
MRS. PERKINS' ROMANTIC TALE
Says Her Husband Is One of the
Three Men Who Becently Sobbed
the Bank at Winne
mucca.
EjwcUl IXÂ«pÂ«*ca to ThÂ« Call.
SACRAMENTO. Nov. 17.â If the story
told by a dressmaker named Mrs. Perkins
is true, and the circumstances seem to
bear it out. she offers splendid material
for the pea of the novelist. A frail, desti
tute young woman, with a two months'
old baby at her breast, seeking protection
for herself and child from the fury of a
husband whose secret she possesses. This
is the light In which Mrs. Perkins, seam
stress, presents herself. The secret is
one which would send her husband to the
penitentiary perhaps for the remainder
of hie life could lt be told in court and
substantiated by corroborative evidence.
On September 39 at noon three masked
men walked into the First National Bank
of Winnemucca, Nev., and with cocked
revolvers made all present hold up their
hands, threaienir.gr with instant death the
first man who offered resistance. Two of
the men bead guard while the third forced
Cashier Nixon to open the snfe and take
out three sscks of gold coin. The rob
bers threw the sold Into a large sack
â¢wliich they carried, together with all tho
gold In the office drawer, and then, still
covering the bmnk officials with their re
volvers, marched them ahead to an alley
in the rear, where three saddled horses
were waiting. The robbers mounted these
bonea with their booty, some $15,<)jO t and,
dashed cut of Winnemucca like the wind
toward the mountains.
The alarm spread and citizens fired
fhots after the fleeing horsemen, but
â¢without effect. A posse was organized,
Lut its search was fruitless.
Because the knew that her husband is
one of these three bold robbers is the
rc-ason aspicrned for Mrs. Perkins' fear
that he srtU kill her. At one of tho
houses where she roomed last week lt le
Faid that Perkins walked through all the
apartments cf the house one night with
his hand en his revolver and the threat
on his lips that he tvould kill her.
Mrs. Perkins came a few months ago
from Nevada and her husband recently
followed. She c^uld not be found In the
city to-day. Whether there is foun
dation In the story, it is certain that
the Sheriff's office here has taken up the
case ard is â¢working: on it in the hope that
it may develop the whereaJsouts of one cf
the bold Winnemucca robbers.

STOCKTON, Nov. 17,-The echoes of the

evening in aid of the Children's arid Old
People's Home will probably be heard Jn
local society for some time to come.
Mrs. James GlUis, one of the patronesses
of the home and a well-known society
lady, pcored the masquerade ball before it
was given and now that it is over is
equally. as emphatic in her denunciation.
In a newspaper interview to-day she saj>:
"I feel that a form of amusement at
which it wa3 found necessaiy to request
polico protection could not draw that clasj
of people with which most of us would
wish to associate. A masquerade ball,
open to the world, is one of the detesta
tions of my life. I did not object par
ticularly to dancing. But when men and
women could come disguised and where
one might dance with the greatest black
leg In the country I did not consider and
do not consider It now the best form.
"Again. 1 most emphatically oppose the
shining of shoes on Sunday as the result
of a low political wager, the proceeds of
which were to go to the home. Of what
moral standing can we hope .to have our
institutions when they are ted by tho
shameful proceeds of Sabbath desecration
and of gambling? And without any moral
standing for. our children's homes by whdt
system of reasoning can we expect that
the little ones there brought up will cÂ»J
out untainted when we allow such dis
graces to attend their education."

SAN JOSE, Nov. 17.â Henry E. Miller,
the student who was refused a certificate
at the State Normal School because of al
leged unfitness. has again taken, his trou
bles into court. This time it is a writ of
mandate directed to Morris E. Dailey, the
principal of the school, and the rest of
the faculty Â£o compel them to admit peti
tioner at the tchool. For the past two
years Miller's troubles have been a dis
turbing factor at the Normal. Mrs. Place,
the head of the manual training depart
ment, refused to graduate Miller, alleging
that he did not possess the necessary
qualifications to become a successful
teacher, and he preferred charges against
her. A hearing exonerated Mrs. Place,
and the trustees barred Miller from the
school. At that time he applied to the
court to compel Professor McNaughion,
who was then principal of the school, to
give him a diploma, but lost his case. .
In the petition tiled to-day Miller states
that on September 4 last, the beginning of
the school term, he applied for admission
to the schoool and was refused the same.
He declares that he is not a person of
filthy or vicious habits and is eligible to
membership in the school. When he en
tered the school he signed an agreement
that he Intended to fit himself for a
teacher, and that he was dismissed with
out any cause whatever. An alternative
writ is asked directing Professor Dalley
to admit him to the school and that he be
permitted to continue his studies.
Miller, who is 40 years of age, has at
tended nearly every normal school in the
State. At each one he has had trouble.
He had been a student at the school hero
for three years.

Do you know what happens to the
human system when the kidneys be-

throw out the impurities from the blood
and become infected -with poisons; they
decay, fall apart and pass out in the
urine; the blood, unaltered, carries the
poison all through the system, and lf
not checked death follows.
The kidneys are the stivers of the human
syitrm.
When your kidneys are not doing
their work", some of the symptoms
which prove it to you are pain or dull
ache in the back, excess of uric acid.

There Isn't a man who would be seen
running through the street munching a
piece of pie. Why not? Because it
would mean dyspepsia and stomach
trouble? Not at all; but because it
wouldn't look well. As a matter of fact
many a business man snatches a lunch
in such a hurry that he might as well
take it on the run. That is one reason
for the prevailing " stomach trouble "
among njen of business.
There is a certain remedy for diseases
of the stomach and other organs of
digestion and nutrition. It is Doctor
Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery. The
worst cases of dyspepsia and catarrh of
toe stomach have been cured by this
medicine. It cures where all other
means have failed to cure.

A Coroner's Jury was impaneled to-day,
but will not hear the evidence until Mon
day.
Dale was over 70 years of age and -was
formerly a locomotive engineer. lie came
to San Diego about ten years ago. after
separation from his wife and children in
Denver. His children are all grown by
this time and three of his sons are em
ployed as locomotive engineers runnivg
out of Denver.
He was last seen at his peanut stand on
Friday evening, but he went home early
on account of the rain. His home was in
a small brick building on Fourth street,
between K and G. A question of foul play
was raised, as it was known that Dale was
the owner of a fine gold watch, and this
was missinff when his body was discov
ered. There was also a large bump on his
head, but It is the general opinion that this
was caused by his head striking against
the rocks on the shore of the bay. The
police will, however, make a thorough in
vestigation and endeavor to learn the real
cause of the old man's death.
While the cause of Dale's death is
shrouded in mystery, it is believed that he
committed suicide by Jumping into the
bay while despondent.
SAN DIEGO. Nov. 17.â The body of Jo
seph Dale, who had been a familiar figure
at the corner of Fifth and H streets,
where he kept a peanut stand for many
years, was found floating in the bay
this morning, at the foot of Thlrd'street.
The body was first seen by "William Mc-
Dougall, at about 6:30 a, m., and from its
condition at that time it was evident that
it had not been in the bay for many hours.
An effort was made to resuscitate the
man, but this was found to be impossible.

in his village town. He met a brother he
had not seen for forty years. Mr. and
Mrs. Hughes will take In the horse show.
Of course, the suit of Mr. Gould's valet,
Mowbray, against his former employe,
claiming damages for the loss of an eye.
by the premature explosion of a distress
rlrerocket abenrd Gould's yacht, has
thrown the Four Hundred into a state of
mtnd bordering on consternation and set
the tongues of gossips wagging furiously.
It Is not so very many moons since Mrs.
Gould was reluctantly admitted into the
society of the exclusive or "smart set."
Mrs. Astor was finally prevailed upon to
seek the assistance of the ex-Callfornla
actress in an amateur theatrical enter
tainment given by the Four Hundred at
the Waldorf-Astoria. Mrs. Gould's per
sonality was so charming, her manner so
winsome, gracious and unaffected that
Mrs. Astor capitulated and gave the word
that admitted Mrs. Gould to the Inner
circle. This followed close upon the heels
of a suit brought by a playwright, who
sought to recover from one William F.
Cody (better known as "Buffalo Bill"),
and his protege, Kathryn Clemmons, a
sum of money alleged to be due him for
writing a play for the talented actress.
This was quite a shock to the Four Hun
dred, but was nothing as compared with
the revelations brought out in the Mow
bray suit. The details of the testimony
adduced have been given in the regular
news columns of The Call and It is need
less to exploit them further In this let
ter.
Mr. and Mrs. George Crocker have fin
ally and definitely announced the date of
their departure for California. They left
to-day for San Francisco in Mr. Crocker's
private- car. Upon her return from the
Pacific Coast Mrs. Crocker will again be
one of tho most active hostesses of the
season. She has laid plans for many
dinners, balls and muslcales and has
added much to her superb new residence
in the way of costly and antique furnish
ings. â¢ The Misses Rutherford will assist
their mother in receiving.
I have mentioned the fact that Mrs.
William K. Vandfrbilt Jr. was at the
automobile show with her sister, Mrs.
Oelrlchs. She goes out but seldom of late,
for a reason that will be read with great
Interest and pleasure by San Francisco
people of her own set. The "reason"
will be duly recorded in this column, and
Its sex. complexion, weight and other in
teresting details will also be duly set
forth hereafter.
Nearly every wealthy family In New
York now has at least one automobile,
and as they rush and whirr down Fifth
avenue it is worth one's life to cross that
ultra fashionable thoroughfare. Society
is debating the advisability and propriety
of adopting peculiar and distinctive liver
ies for the automobile "attendants."
"Bubbling" is the latest fad of the four
hundred. Why they should call it "bub
bling" Is not apparent. Perhaps It Is
meant for a sort of an abbreviation. for
automobling or locomobling. The show
was a great event at Madison Square
Garden last week. The following ladies
were prominent In "the ring," all of them
accomplished "bubblers": Mrs. Herman
Oelrlchs and her sister (Mrs. William K.
Vanderbilt Jr.), Mrs. George de Forest,
Mrs. Albert Bostwick. Mrs. Fred Geb
hardt. Mrs. Hamilton Cary, Mrs. Loril
lard Spencer, Mrs. Mortimer Brooks, Miss
Gladys Brooks and Miss Daisy Post.
NEW YORK, Nov. 17.-Followlng close
upon the heels of the automobile exhibit
comes the great annual horse show at
Madison Square Garden, beginning Mon
day night. The opening night is always
a particularly brilliant spectacle. Imagine
a vast arena capable of seating nearly
20.000 people; the tiers of boxes filled with
the families of millionaires; women re
splendent in rich costumes and costly
jewels, each vainly trying to outshine her
sister, amid the waving of 10,000 fans, not
to mention the fleam of 10,000 manly shirt
bosoms. I have mentioned the men and
women and their dress, as if the horses
were a secondary consideration. And of
course they are, for nobody pretends that
these ostentatious horse shows are any
thing else than exhibitions of dress. Of
course the exhibits in the ring are. note
worthy and bring "ahs" and "ohs" and
other rapturous exclamations of admira
tion from the lips of the fair sex, but a
parade of vanity is the first consideration
and, indeed. Is worth goto g miles to see.
The wife of a very wealThy New Yorker
has imported from the mines direct a
huge diamond, uncut, valued at $40,000,
and has offered the lapidary extra com
pensation if he will have it ready to be
worn on the opening night of the horse
show.

Important action has also been takpn by
th*> samp board in the development of ar
tillery and it is predicted that within the
next twelve months greater advance will
be made in seacoast and field artillery
than has b'-en accomplished during the
last two decades. Artillery service has
nrw become an intricate science and the
pay of enlisted men. he says, should l>e
lriTr-asr-d proportionately.
General Miles does not think it wise to
longr-r delay thÂ«Â» practical apnlioation of
vehicles to the military ser
vice.
General Miles claims that the Fortifica
tions Board has developed a high explo-
Eiv<s superior in effectiveness to all known
tafe military explosives. It can be used
in any service projectile; can be thrown
any distance within the capacity nf anv
high-power gun through steel armor plate
end exploded with most destructive ef
fÂ»Tt.
General Miles calls attention to the fact
that under the law the volunteers in the
Philippines must be withdrawn and dis
charged before July 1 next, wherefore, he
i-ays, it will be necessary to begin their
return home almost immediately.
The report shows what has been accom
plished in the officers' training schools
and toward the extension of the coaPt de
fÂ«risp system. On this last great work
General Miles says IS8.C08.000 has been ex
pended" already and at least $45,000,000 will
be required tn carry out the present
project. For the next, fiscal year alone
the fum of H1.&27.OO0 is estimated as nec
essary to defray the cost of fortifications.
barracks and sites on the coasts. The
largest figure is t2.7ZI.tS for New York;
next comes California, with 5!.417.?r'6;
Maine. $1,2>Â«.?2.": Oregon and Washington,
Sl.lOfi.&g, and Virginia, Â£C5,450. To Porto
Rico is aspierm-d $332,400. while the na
tional capital is set down for jrÂ»0.<HÂ«1.
Touching upon the Chinese campaign,
General Mllea compares the American
contingent in the Peking expedition favor
ably with those of other nationalities.
General Miles mentions the gallantry of
Colonel E. S. Liscum and Captain Koilly,
killed in China, and of Major Jesse M.
Lee.
General Miles says that during the past
two years the army has been engaged in
t\\<t hemispheres under all conditions and
hardships and has on all occasions ex
hibited courage, stability, excellent
marksmanship and devotion to duty.
The report snows that the urgent de
mand for troops for remote stations has
reduced the r.umlÂ»er in t.ie Cnited States
to a much smaller force than has been
maintained at any time during the past
thirty-nine years. In fact, says General
Miles, the force ha*= been so much reduced
that at the present time there a.re not.
one-fourth enough troops properly to care
tot and man the fortilirations which have
been erected on the seatoast at an ex
penditure of nearly SaS.'OOOjOOO. In addition
to the artillery deliciency, the present
home force is not sufficient to occupy the
interior garrisons properly or to protect
life and property on the Western frontier,
and. what is still more serious, the Â«Jov
trnment is left without troops to relieve
those who have had too much tropical ser
vice. The actual number of troops re
mair.ir.g in the L'niled States after trie dis
patch ot soldiers to Cuba, Porto Rico,
Alaska and the Pnilippints is said to be
if.*> officers and !>.Â«Â«!> enlisted men.
General Mile< renews his recommenda
tion that the permanent force of the army
should be one man for each LOW of popu
lation of the United States. la supplying
eny increase ol the army he urges that
appointments ol officers be made with a
due regard for the principle of seniority
and that each case be passed upon by a
board of the highest officers of the army,
as was done in the reorganization follow
ing the civil war. He submits a draft of
a I'iil embodying his views and recom
mendations on army reorganization.

eral Miles, commanding the army, is a.
chapter dealing with the need for a gen
eral reorganization of the military ser
vice General Miles points out that the
I'ractical limitation of the service "of the
volunteers to one year in the Philippines
makes this almost expensive practice,
jitfefsitating a double transfer of troops
and adding enormously to the cost of the
organization. He also points out the need
of a reserve force for th* relief of the
fcoldkrs who serve in lhe tropics, declar
ing .that the regimen^*; that have so far
served more than two years at unhealthy
etaiior.* should be relieved.
Asks for a Big Increase, Declaring
That the Present Force Is En
tirely Inadequate to the
Demands.
Recommends the Appoint
ment of a Board lor

REORGANIZATION
OF THE ARMY
NEW YORK, Nov. 17.â To test to the
utmost the capabilities of the Holland
submarine boat, one of Bix vessels of that
type now building in the Nixon ship
yards at Elizabethport is to be taken
across the ocean. That is the summary of
what John P. Holland, the inventor of the
submarine boat which bears his name,
said to The Call correspondent to-nlgrht.
Mr. Holland expects it will not be later
than the middle of March. He said to
The Call correspondent:
"We had hoped to keep quiet until the
Mr. Holland is thormiRhly confident of
the. success of the proposed trip and be
lieves that the possibilities it will de
velop for submarine craft of the Holland
type will surprise the naval world.
starting time. To begin with, I maintain
that every Holland boat now being built
can croas the ocean under her own steam.
When the one to be launched In January
is ready we will wait for the roughest
sea and the heaviest weather we can ex
pect and then make testing trips of from
1000 to 2000 miles on deep sea. One of
the trips possibly will be to Cuba. We
will man her with a full crew, which is
ordinarily seven men. I will be aboard
and one other member of our company,
who is anxious to make the trip, will be
with us. He does not care to have his
name mentioned now. There will be
plenty of room for us, as we could carry
twenty men If necessary.
"As long as the deep-sea trip will be
entirely experimental, we will, as a pre
cautionary measure, have a tender, de
spite the fact that we have no fear of
the result. This will be a ship of prob
ably 1500 tons burden and. will carry an
extra crew and all machinery and parts
which would become necessary* to the
submarine boat under whatever emer
gency. '
- "Borne time ajro an eminent German
naval architect. Professor Busbey. In a
lecture in Germany, said absurd things !
about submarine boats, which included
ours. Amonsr other things he said that
their low stability would make them un
comfortable In heavy seas or wenther.
We will prove that our boat will not pitch
or roll in any sea. When we make the
trip across the ocean we will take the
southern route, touching at the Bermudas
and going thence to Lisbon. In our trips
heretofore we have arranged to confine our
operations to a radius of 500 knots, but by
crossing the ocean we will also demon
strate the fact that we can carry a large
amount of fuel without inconveniencing
our crew or hindering It." Â»

Admiral O'Neill said that the results
were most satisfactory and so far* as ha
knows the record is the best obtained
from any 12-lnch gun in the world. The
energy of the gun fired to-day Is 63 per cent
greater than any of Ihe 12-lnch guns In

I aa fifty-two years old, and for forty
years of that time I have been a chronic
catarrh sunVr*>r. says Mr. James Gleshlng
of Allegheny City; with every chance of
wfath<r my head and throat would be
6turT>d up wtth catarrhal mucus.
I could not breathe naturally throuph
the nostrils for months together and much
of the time I euffered from catarrh of the
stomach. Finally my hearing bepan to
fall and I realized something must be
done.
I tried inhalers and sprays and salves
which gave me temporary relief, and my
nhvslclan advised me to *pray or douche
with Peroxide of Hydrogen. But the ca-
tarrh would speedily return in a few days,
and I became thoroughly discouraged.
I had always been prejudiced against
patent medicines, but as everything els*
had failed I felt Justified in at least mak.
r "5ur 'good old family phyMclan. Dr.
Ramsdtll. laughed at me a little, but said
if I was determined to try patent medi-
cines he would &dvl*e me to b*gin with
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, because he
knew what they contained and he had
iu-ard of several remarkable cures result-
ing from their use. and. furthermore, that
they were perfectly safe, containing no
cocaine or opiates. -^.
The next day I bousht a fifty-cent box
at a drup store, carried It in my pocket
and four or five times a day J would take
a tablet In I**** than a week I felt a
marked improvement, which continued
until at this time I am entirely free from
any trace *t catarrh.
My head i? clear, my throat free from
Irritation, my hearing Is as good as it
Â»ver was and I feol that I cannot say
inouRti in praise of Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
Thoe tablets contain extract of Euca-
tvptus bark. Guaiarol. blood root and
other valuable antiseptics combined in
pleasant tablet form, and it Is safe to say
that Stuart's Catarrh Tablfts are far su-
perior in convenience, safety and effec-
tiveness to the antiquated treatment by
inhalers, sprays and douches.

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR GEORGIA.
AT the last session of the Georgia Legislature a
bill designed to restrict negro suffrage was
introduced, but failed of passage. Now an
other bill with the same intent, framed on the model
of that recently adopted in North Carolina, has been
brought forward, and it remains to be seen whether
the Georgians will stand by their right decision or fol
low the evil example set them by so many of their
sister States.
Georgia has now an opportunity to do much to
redeem the South from the discredit that has come
upon it through the tricks devised and adopted to de
feat the intent of the constitution and deprive th
ncgro of the franchise conferred upon him as a recog
nition of his rightful place in American citizenship.
The Georgians can make no just complaint of fears
of negro domination.- Equal suffrage has prevailed
there ever since the close of the war, and the State
during most of that time has been under full control
of the whites. It has had a fair degree of prosperity,
and of late, since the people have turned their atten
tion to mining and manufacturing as well as to cot
ton growing, the advance of the State in population
and in wealth has been one of the most notable in
dustrial features of the decade. Consequently Georgia
nas no grave evil to complain of. On the contrary,
her people have every inducement to let well enough
alone.
At the time when the former bill was under consid
eration it was opposed by a large majority of the in
fluential men of the State, and its defeat was easy.
Those men declared at that time that the true policy
of Georgia is to leave suffrage as it is, and to seek by
education and by industrial development to fit the
negroes for the rights of citizenship by treating them
riehtly. In other words, the negroes were to be in
structed in the duties of citizenship by practicing
those duties. < H; -
It is true that much of this excellent preaching on
the part of the Georgians was hypocritical, for the
negro vote has been virtually suppressed there by in
direct methods, and a Republican ticket has no chance
of success; but still a considerable part of it was sin
cere and honest. Even that which was hypocritical
was at least a tribute to honesty, for it was a recogni
tion that equal suffrage is in itself desirable.
It is to be hoped the Georgians will not fall back
from the position they took at that time. The pa
triotism displayed by the Southern people during the
Spanish war^has banished the last lingering prejudice
that may have existed in the North against them, and
it is known that the present administration is desirous
of advancing Southern interests and breaking up the
unnatural condition of politics that prevails there. If
the Georgians, therefore, will only show a willingness
to co-operate with the better elements of the whole
DRIED APPLE CHAMPAGNE.
ACCORDING to a correspondent of the New
York Tribune, the Department of Agriculture
at Washington is engaged in making experi
ments to determine the effect of the activity of cer
tain microbes in the fermentation of wine and cider.
The correspondent says:
"Everybody has heard and has told with disgust
of the shipment of vast quantities of California wine
to France, to be returned and sold as French wine.
But that is nothing ro the cider plan. Now it is toM
that American applesâ not good ones, but such as
can find no market as applesâ are dried and sent to
France in bales and there soaked and ground and
made into cider and treated with the chosen microbe
and sent back to this country as champagne, and such
champagne, too, as an expert can scarcely tell from
the genuine."
The story comes quite apropos to the discussion of
proper labeling which the French precipitated upon
us by excluding some of our wines from competition
at Paris. If the reports be accurate that French deal
ers not only put their brands on cheap California
wines first imported to France and then sent back to
New York, but are also furnishing champagne made
from dried apples, it is clearly time for California
winemakers to drop the use of French names. There
is, of course, some doctored and "sophisticated" wine
made in this State, but it is only a small fraction of
the whole wine output. As a rule, our wines are pure
and arc made from grapes of good quality. Why,
then, should any of our winemakers desire to put
upon them a label that will give rise to suspicion that
they may be fraudulent?
Concerning the experiments, it is stated they are
based upon a theory that the excellence of a wine de
pends not ?o much on the fruit from \vhich the juice
comes as upon the Tight microbe getting into the
juice. It is claimed upon that theory that if we can
propagate and cultivate the right microbe the wine
produced from dried apples will be as good as the
choicest wines made from grapes. The corre
spondent adds that the Agricultural -Department is
getting on rapidly with the experiments and has at
tained jome encouraging results.
New York is Democratic and the State is Republi
can, so the Republicans purpose to establish a State
constabulary so as to take the city police force out of
Democratic hands; St. Louis is a Republican city
and Missouri is a Democratic State, so the Demo
crats purpose to have a State constabulary to take
control of the St. Louis police. It would appear
from this that among our Eastern fellow citizens the
police force is regarded as the biggest thing in poli
tics.
If the people of San Francisco entertained as slight
a regard for the Board of Education and the Super
intendent of Schools as they, judging from their in
terminable rows, have for one another, his Highness
the Mayor would see the necessity of appointing a
new governing body for the public schools.
THE small majority of Tammany in Xew York
hss given impulse to the energy of these who
hope to free the citj' from the control of that or
ganization.
Bishop Potter has taken up the fight against offi
.â¢ cially encouraged vice in that city with a will and a
vim that seem to promise good results. His state
ments are not based on theories but upon facts which
. he has carefully collected, and the result should
' startle the country.
In its actual government New York is not a suf
ferer. Public administration there is fairly economi
Â¦ cal. But, considered from a moral standpoint, the
government is rotten. Tammany, through its con
itTol of the courts and the police, deliberately uses the
; city as a vast vice plant. Sin and folly are encour
â¢ aged by immunity, and their income is blackmailed
by TaTTjmany. Bishop Potter shows figures to prove
that Croker's organization derives from its taxation
I of crime and vice an income of nearly five millions a
year. This money is partly used to retain its politi
cal hold upon the city, and the rest is divided among
4ihe big chiefs, who, with no visible or honorable
means of support or profit, are rolling in sin-derived
riches.
Conditions have become so startlingly rotten that
the public conscience is quickened, and even the easy
going, â¢who are satisfied if their tax bills are not high
and the streets are cleaned, are becoming disquieted
2nd show a willingness to even pay more taxes if the
city can bÂ« morally cleansed.
Bishop Potter is not given to sensational state
ments. He is a man of steady judgment In a letter
to Mayor Van Wyck, Croker's agent and minion, he
. cays: "1 call upon you, sir, to save these people, who
5n a very real way are committed to your charge,
from a living hell, defiling, deadly, damning, to which
the criminal snpineness of constituted authorities, s-t
for the defense of decency and good order, threatens
to consign us."
These words tear and cut as they are uttered. They
do not come from a mere impulsive sentimentalist,
bet from a wise citizen, who is under no romantic illu
sions about human nature, but believes that govern
ment is instituted to repress vice and not to share its
profits.
The metropolis of the continent should be morally
. ra well as physically the pride of the country. No one
-an donbt that New York, under the conditions fos
ired by Croker and Tammany, Is the odium of the
United States.
Without believing that ricÂ« can be extirpated by
f^ny 'official vigilance, all men know that it can be
minimized and restrained. The sympathies of the
t country will go out to any body of men who make a
brave fight to break up the vice factory which is the
source of Croker's power and pelf.

Joffroy dies during Bertrand's absence the galley is to hoist 'a

But Rudel cannot content himself merely with sing!ng the
praises of the Princess; there comes over him a longing to see
herâ a longing so great that he must satisfy it or die. Ac
cordingly he embarks for Tripoli, taking with him his bosom
friend, Bertrand d'AIlamanon, knight and troubadour of Pro
vence; Father Trophime, his chaplain, and Erasmus, his phy
sician. Their vessel is ittacked by a Turkish pirate, whom
they beat off with difficulty; storms batter their frail craft,and
starvation threatens them. â¢ â¢ â¢ At this point the play op*>ns,
the stage showing the deck of their disabled and blood-stained
galley. ThÂ© common sailors have become infected with Rudel's
desire to gaze upon the Princess; this sustains them and makes
them hope against hope that they shall yet reach the shores
of Tripoli. So much pf the action as precedes the rising of the
curtain is skillfully explained by a conversation between Father
Trohpime and Erasmus; then Prince Joffroy, who is dying from
fever, is brought on deck.
The germ of his story M. de Rostand found in an old Pro
vencal legend ("only a few lines," he says) recorded in "Nostra
damus." Joffroy Rudel, Prince of Blaye and troubadour from
Aqultalne, has heard of the wonderful beauty of Melissinde, a
Princess of. Orient, Countess of Tripoli." He composes a song
in her honor, which is sung by troubadours and pilgrims not
only throush the lengih and breadth of France btit also
throughout all the M-iditerranean coasts. Here Is the third
stanza in French and the entire song in English (translated by
Charles Renauld): '

It was Sarah Bernhardt who introduced him to London when
she played a short engagement there in the summer of 1835.
P'our out o* the thirty-one performances she gave upon this
occasion were devoted to a short four-act play called "La
Princesse' Lointalne" ("The Princess Far Away)." a play which
did not commend Itself to the mature judgment of M. Sarcey
and In which only one or two of the English critics could find
anything out of the ordinary. Yet the most cursory reading
of this play discloses the same defects and the same virtues
that characterize "Cyrano de Bergerac"â a conventional but
skillfully handled plot, an excess of dialogue: wit, lyrical
power and a keen eye for the details of stage effect.
T IS difficult to realize that only five years ago M. de
Rostand, now fam ous as the author of "Cyrano de Berge
rac." had acquired but little reputation among his own coun
trymen and was practically unknown among the English-
THAT IDEAL PflPER AGAIN.
DR. PARKHURST of New York, who was
famous a few years ago and who may not be
forgotten yet by persons of good memories,
recently told a reporter of the New York Herald that
a syndicate of wealthy men in that city are seriously
discussing the advisability of establishing an ideal
newspaper. The doctor defined an ideal newspapc
as one that is at once "enterprising and truthful."
He is quoted as saying: "When we read a news
paper we do not know 'whether we are reading the
truth. We have a very strong presumption that we
are not. I am speaking, remember, of the average
paper. At the present time there, are some who are
anxiously considering the matter of establishing a
journal for the purpose of telling the truth, and suffi
ciently capitalizing it so that it will have no trouble in'
telling the truth."
The theory here announced that there must be a
large capitalization in order to enable a paper to have
"no trouble in telling the truth" is one which we trust
is peculiar to New York. That, however, is a minor
matter. The main point is the reliability of the exist
ing newspaper, and upon that point the Boston Globe
was printing a complete answer to Parkhurst just
about the time Parkhurst was making his charge that
people do not rely upon newspapers.
The Globe announced to its readers on the' nth of
this month, that is, five days after the election: "Mr.
McKinley has not been re-elected and Mr. Bryan has
not been defeated. There has been no choice pf Presi
dent. Even the Electors have not been chosen."
Then the Globe went on to say: "To be sure, 15,000,
000 voters went to the polls and cast their ballots full
five days ago, but these votes have not been duly
counted and declared in any one of the forty-five
States of the Union. How, then, can we be so cer
tain who received a majority? There is positively no
official information. All we have seen thus far is
'mere newspaper talk,' and every cautious, long-faced
citizen in the community will solemnly warn you not
to 'believe anything you read in the newspapers.' "
The point which the Globe so cleverly makes ex
poses the absurdity of the oft-repeated assertion that
the. public cannot and does not believe the newspapers.
As a matter of fact the whole civilized world accepts
the report of the newspapers upon the result of the
Presidential election, and hardly one in a thousand
has more than a passing curiosity to know what
the official figures will show.
As in that case so in all others. The newspaper of
to-day is about as near Dr. Parkhurst's ideal as it is
possible for human energy, honesty and enterprise to
accomplish. There are fake papers, of course, just as
there are fake preachers in the church, but they are
not to be counted in questions affecting legitimate
journalism. The people know papers of that kind
and are not deceived by them except where they wish
to be deceived for the purpose of satisfying prejudice.
Still, if Dr. Parkhurst knows a of wealthy
men who are willing to try to improve on the press
of the day we will guarantee them a cordial welcome
tc the field. Our wealthy men can never be too en
terprising, and money sent streaming through the
channels of journalism is just as beneficial as in any
other channel.

M. DE ROSTAND'S DRAMATIC
FAIRY STORY.
COMMERCIAL HONOR.
THE Santa Ana Blade very properly and im
pressively warns the orange-growers of South
ern California that they must cease rushing their
fruit in an unripe condition into an early market.
This State is in a position to control the citrus fruit
and raisin market of the country, as well as to domi
nate in canned and dried fruit. But this can be done
only by observing strictly the rules of commercial
honor. This State, in its fruit production, can outdo
the world. Our wines and brandies, and our other
products of the vineyard and orchard, are easily the
best and are the greatest in variety. For every pound
of fruit and every pint of wine and brandy there is a
profitable market, at home and abroad, if we will^
sternly adhere to commercial honor. Let it be added
that commercial intelligence is also required. Dif
ferent markets require different methods of prepara
tion. Our export trade in canned and dried fruits
should be studied more thoroughly. The countries
to which we export are accustomed to a different
method of packing from that which is acceptable to
the home market. Abroad, goods are most accept
able in glass package*. The eye must be pleased as
well as the palate. We import French peas, and ber
ries, in glass. An examination of the packages show3
that the greatest care is observed in packing, so as to
strike the eye. The color and form of the fruit are
studied and the artistic sense is present in the whole
process of preparation. The same is true of dried
fruit. We have impressed Europe with our prune
product, and foreign producers admit their inability to
compete with it, either in price or quality. Our other
dried fruits are following the cleavage made by the
prune. As far as that market is concerned its com
plete conquest is only a matter of agreeable packing
and first-class quality. The subject is immense, and
immensely affects the whole industrial future of Cali
fornia.
The suggestion of the Santa Ana paper covers pan
of it. The Southern California orange is a late
ripener. The hurry to crowd it into the Thanksgiving
market is a mistake. It not only injures the citrus
product of that section, but destroys the symmetry of
the State's capacity. The Northern California orange,
with the center of its field at Oroville. Butte County,
nearly in the latitude of Chicago, is an early ripener.
For several days the fine Oroville orange has been in
the market here, in perfect condition. It has been
exported East for the Thanksgiving market there, and
Southern California should be content to let it fill the
etrly demand. To unfairly compete with it, with un
ripe fruit, is to damage the reputation of the whole
crop of the State and discourage further planting in
the north. If the market were treated fairly the repu
tation of the State as a citrus producer would be
greatly enhanced. It would then be demonstrated to*
the market that California has the longest orange sei
son of any part of the world. Our northern orange
would strike the trade, in November, in excellent con
dition and hold it from November to January, and
then the Southern California orange would follow,'
filling the demand until spring. The trade would be
glad to discover that our season of perfect fruit covers
about seven months in the year, a long season. that
neither Florida nor Mexico nor Sicily can hope to
rival. If the south will refrain from crowding the
market with oranges that should be left on the trees
the orchards of the north will be greatly increased to
supply the early demand, and the south will be in no
way injured, for the northern fruit does not compete
with it at all in point of time. Instead of shipping
unripe oranges to the East, Southern California
should be a customer for our earlier fruit, as we are
for her later crop.
A little less desire to make a present profit, at the
risk of destroying a rising market, would greatly
benefit the whole State.
country in dealing with the race problem, they will
not only profit themselves but will* confer a benefit
upon all their sister States of the South.

was one-sided and unreliable, and inti

something out of the oil company through
the prosecution of thn Rice case against
the company. All these charges are de

upon official and court records. He
charges ' direct connection, between the

times of railroad favors made to the im
provement company. In this connection
he refers to the testimony taken by the
Interstate Commerce Commission, in Bos
ton in 1898. as going to show that the Bos
ton and Albany Railroad is "underbill
ing cars of the oil trust to such an extent
that in some cases half of such shipments
in Massachusetts went free."
Mr. Lloyd also says: "The evidence
taken in the investigation in the early
part of 1900 by the Canadian Parliamen
tary committee, if correctly reported,
seems to indicate that the same old South
Improvement ! Company system substan
tially has been extended by the Canadian,
railroads to the oil trust, and that these
railroads have been putting the price of
transportation down for the favored cus
tomers and up for the other. Just as the
Supreme Court of Ohio found the rail
roads of that State doing for the same or
ganization in 1S85.

had come to Los Angeles on the same
train with him.
The professor said he would go back to
Phoenix to attend his trial. He was con
fident he would be acquitted, and when
that was over he would return to Los An
geles and take up his business again, as
he expected to make this city his perma
nent home. All he wanted was to be let
alone, as he was not seeking notoriety, of
which he had already received more than
he wanted, but wished to go ahead and
try to live down the affair, if possible.

nljrht and day ever since she vras first
arrested in Arizona. She Bays that she
is confident that her daughter was under
the hypnotic influence of Professor Har
ris and that she was not responsible for
her act. In her opinion It is a most seri
ous case, as her daughter's mind wa# al
most wrecked. As it is. her condition is
yet precarious, and it will take weeks of
rest and quiet under new surroundings to
thoroughly restore her to her normal con
dition.
Mrs. McComas and her husband. Judge

SOLDIERS TO ROUND

Mexican Government Dispatches
Troops to the Scene of the
Recent Outbreak.
EL, PASO. Tex.. Nov. 17.â One company
of soldiers from the post at Juarez way
to-day sent to the scene of the Apache
outbreak in the Sierra Madre Mountains
at Pacheco. Mexico. The Mexican Gov
ernment evidently considers the situation
serious, for troops have been sent from
several interior points and It Is believed
that the small band of renejrades can be
hemmed up In the mountains and ex
terminated before they can make thfclr
way back to the Arizona reservation.
A party of Mormons is already in pur
suit. A dispatch from Arizona confirms
the report that the Indians escaped from
the reservation at San Carlos. It says
that only nine soldiers were left to guard
3000 Indians and that the redskins were
restless for weeks.

There is Joy In the hearts of the farmer
and the fruit-gTOwer. Their worried looks
have given way to beaming- countenances.
Their better halves and children are now
looking forward to a happy Thanksgiving
day feast and a Joyful Christmas. This
feeling is due to the heavy ralnfaH^cx
perienced throughout the State during the
!ast forty-eight hours and which is ex
pected to continue for a longer period.
The crops have been greatly benefited by
the rainfall. It means a golden shower to
the farmers and is welcomed with as
great a joy as the re-election of McKin
ley.
In discussing the storm last evening:.
Forecaster McAdie, Chief of the United
States Weather Bureau on this coast,
made the following interesting state
ment:
"The storm has been quite extensive
and is the largest I have seen on this
coast during the last lour or five years.
It would have gone east and we might
have had but a day or so of rain, had it
not been for an area of hlgrh pressure,
due to a 'polar surg," which overlies Mon
tana, Alberta and Saskatchewan. This?
high pressure blocked the eastern courso
of the 'low,' and so :L has been forced
southward and to-night covers the entire
coast. It Is raining from the Mexican to
the Canadian boundaries.
"We do not often have that condition.
To-night's reports show that It is rain
ing all through Arizona. Los Angeles has
received a, generous rainfall. The Infor
mation we have received shows that 1.06
Inches of rain has fallen, which la a glori
ous happening because the moisture was
very greatly needed in Southern Califor
nia.
"I have no doubt that this storm Is one
of the greatest benefits In a way that has
befallen this State for some time. The
orange crop particularly needed the rain,
as it was coloring 1 very rapidly, and the
growers were afraid that there might be
some injurious results from the Ions., dry
season.
"In the northern valleys. San Joaquin
and Salinas particularly, the rainfall has
been exceedingly heavy. It gives the
farmers a supply of water that will carry
them for Quite a while, and what Is cf
more consequence, it restores the confi
dence of the farmer in the rain conditions
of this State.
"The storm Is still with us. and I will
not cult on the rain forecast until the
'high' gets out of the road. I would ad
vise that the residents of this city arm
themselves with umbrellas when they go
out-doors to-day. There will be intervals?
of clear weather, as was seen yesterday.
"The heaviest rainfall this city experi
enced was between 0:10 and 6:45 o'clock
Friday night. Our automatic record
shows a rainfall of .15 of an inch durine
that time, which Is a phenomenal record
for this city. It was the heaviest rainfall
recorded by our automatic Instruments In
the last nine years, as shown by the auto
matic tipped bucket rain pauge."
According to the Southern Pacific's
weather report received at 7 a. ro. yester
day, the rainfall has been quite general
the last two days all over thl.<Â« section of
the country. On every division of the
big road cloudy weather was reported.
The season's rainfall in this city up to
yesterday was 3.81. On the same date last
year It was 5.75. Below Is Riven the tem

The Caminetti Law One of the Leading Topics
for Discussion. I
Expectation ia on tiptoe concerning the
proceedings of the convention of the Cali

this week ln Golden Gate Hall. It is an
open secret that certain prominent miners
go Into the convention with the determin
ation, as one has expressed U, "to have
the question of hydraullcking and the
value of the Caminettl law -thoroughly
threshed out." Another prominent mem
ber of the convention said: "We have to
do something. If the Caminettl law does
not give us what we supposed it did we
wish to find that out right away. There
Is little advantage ln getting a permit
from the Debris Commission to hydraulic
if some one is going to tie up such priv
ilege with a claim that practically stops
work. The vitality of the Caminettl act
has to be determined. The^miners see the
necessity for some actlonfand I look for
a lively discussion and something positive
from the convention about to assemble."
An interesting: feature of the proceed

This Is another evidence of the fact that
Grape-Nuts food contains the phosphato
cf potash which unites- with albumen to
make the gray matter ln the nerve center*
and brain. Any brain worker who values
health, strength and vigor should pay
hÂ»Â«d to the character of food he uses.
"I am fiatiefled that all the ills that I
have suffered were due to the fact that I
lived Just aa thousands of others who
think they are -well fed, but are in a state
of semi-starvation, owing to imperfect
HFslm!la.r!on of'food.' The nerve centers
cannot be properly nourished and rebuilt
except by good food and food that can
VÂ»e Â«5lÂ£PFted and.?s*imilated. Grape-Nut?
food is the nioFt perfect food I have ever
e<-.pn. "nd I know of Us value from prac-
tical results. " ,
"About six months ago I was threatenel
with nervous prostration again, when a
friend advised me to eafGrape-Xuts food.
I was entirely skeptical concerning any
bftneficiai results, but, finding the food
very palatable. I bought package after
package, and since beginning the use of
Grape-Nuts have taken :'o medicine or
r.erve tonics of any kind, and the effect of
this perfect food on toy health is some-
thing very remarkable. All headache*.
Insomnia and a disagreeable cough anJ
rr.y symptoms of paralysis have disap-
r eared.
"One of the most remarkable effects of
the food Grape-Nuts is thÂ« effect on tha
mind. It makes one feel buoyant, hopeful
en<i cheerful." say* Alice I>. Glunt of 24:2
Eroad street, Altoona.. Pa. She continues:

LEAVENWORTH, Kans., Nov. 17.â Two
of the convicts, Kstell and Cravens, who
escaped from the State penitentiary Fri
day afternoon, are still at large, having
eluded a cordon of guards and escaped
from a barn in which they had been sur
rounded.
Last night they succeeded in evading
the officers and went to Brighton, where
they hid in the barn of Robert Moore.
This afternoon Mrs. Moore entered the
barn and saw the convicts. Leaving her
little boy to watch, she started -for a
neighbors and met some of the prison
guards, whom she told where the men
were. The guards sent for assistance and
began firing into the barn, which was
completely riddled with buckshot. Not
being able to force the convicts out, a
handkerchief saturated with coal oil and
lighted was thrown into the barn from the
shelter of a nearby crib, and in a few mo
ments the barn was a sheet of flames.
Nothing was seen of the convicts, and
unless they are burled under the burning
hay they have made their escape.

besides attending to his manifold duties

In the year JS85 Vlnlng published a work
entitled "An Inglorious Columbus," â¢ in
which he sought to prove that the Pacific
Coast was visited by a party of Buddhist
monks from Afghanistan in the early part
of the fifth century. The work showed
exhaustible research by the writer, but
was never treated seriously.
Recently some American army officers
have unearthed ancient records in Peking
showing - that the Chinese discovered
America 1500 years ago. The Chinese
when they visited this country erected
temples in the State of Sonora, Mexico.
One of the large stones recently found In
the- ruins was covered with Chinese char
acters, which were partially deciphered by
a learned Chinese who visited the ruins
at the urgent request of the Mexican
Government.
Quotations from Vintages book are as
follows: â¢

heard of foreign merchants who had landed

More than a century ago there spranu up a
school, of critics who disputed the unanimous

America. . .
It has long been claimed 1 that the In
dians of the State of Sonora are the de
scendants of these Chinese settlers. They
possess many traditions and characteris
tics of the Chinese. If the report of the
finding of these records in Peking Is veri

The late Creed Haymond, famous as a
lawyer and politician and man of wealth,
created on the Bella Vista ranch in San
Mateo County a. country seat, where he
6ought rest from business.
After Mr. Haymond's death the prop
erty was purchased by Henry H. Davis,
the well-known attorney, of 420 California
street, San Francisco. The profuse oil
seepages on the ranch were known to
Mr. Haymond, and he often spoke of de
velopment., but nothing was done in that
line until Mr. Davis acquired the prop
erty. Recent Investigations by oil ex
perts determined , Mr. Davis to organize
the Bella Vista oil syndicate, comprising
well-known San Francisco and Kansas
City business men and capitalists. The
president of the company Is Dr. A. E.
Keumelster of Kansas City: first vice
president is Henry II. Davis of San Fran
clscp. Chas. F. O'Brien of . Kansas City
is secretary. The assistant secretary and
manager Is Thomas Gilbert of this city,
a practical oil man of many years' expe
rience.
The Bella Vista oil syndicate opened a
beautiful office last Monday morning on
the first floor of the Bush-street side of
the Mills building, where stock is on sale,
and where prospectuses and full Informa
tion may be had.
The capital stock Is $1,500,000. the shares
$1 each, par value. A limited amount of
stock is offered to Investors at 10 cents
per share. Offices have also been opened
at Kansas City.
It Is proposed to begin at once to'de
velop the Bella Vista ranch, the entire
1200 acres of which Is believed to be first
class oil territory. The property is eight
een miles west from Redwood City, Is
abundantly supplied with wood and wa
ter, and will at once become the seat of
active oil development. â¢ â¢

woman was equally reticent. By an acci
dent Reynolds discovered that Walker
was Waldron's assailant. Waldron then
admitted the fact, but said he would posi
tively decline to prosecute him if he were
arrested.
The detectives started out to find
WaJker. and about 5 o'clock he was lo
cated in a saloon at Powell and Ellis
streets. He was taken to the City Prison
and locked up In "the tanks," but later
a charge of assault to murder was booked
against him. In the afternoon he was
released on $1000 bonds. He also refused
to make any statement, saying that he
and Waldron were friends and he would
not talk till the proper time arrived. He
pretended that he was drunk at the time
and that was all there was to it, but De
tective Reynolds says he was quite sober
when arrested.
Waldron's friends assert that there was
evidently a plot laid to Induce him to
give up money, as the woman bears the
reputation of-beinsr of a crafty nature and
liable to concoct Just sqch a scheme, but

THE VICTIM AND THE'" WO
MAN IN WHOSE ROOM, THE
CUTTING OCCURRED. -i
MILO WALDRON, one of the pro
prietors of the Majestic saloon
on Market street, was attacked
with a knife by William Walker
in room 65 of the Palmerlce
House, 133 Ellis street, about 3 o'clock
yesterday morninff and cut four times on
the neck and back. None of the wounds
are serious. The room is occupied by a
woman known as Mabel Walker, who un
til recently lived with Walker, a well
known saloon-keeper of ' Los Angeles.
Walker has been in the city for several
weeks, and has been a conspicuous figure
In the "tenderloin" district where he met
the woman who assumed his name.
All the persons Interested are reticent as
to the cause of the attack upon Waldron.
From what could be learned Waldron re
ceived a note shortly after midnight ask
ing him to call at the woman's room. Ho
went there as soon as he could, and while
talking to the woman some one knocked
on the door. Waldron stepped toward
the door to open it, but was stopped by
the woman/ who said, "Billy must be on
the outside." The key had been removed
from the lock and Harry Ten Brock, tho
bellboy, inserted a pasa key and opened
the doer.
Walker was the person who had
knocked and he entered the room. He
does not have the use of his right hand,
as It is under treatment for some dis
ease, but in his left hand he had an- open
Jackknife. He started in to abuse Wal
dron for being In the woman's room, and
Waldron told him to put away the knife
and not make a fool of himself. Walker
rushed at Waldron and cut him four
times. Bue Irwin. who occupies the ad
joining room, heard the Walker woman's
screams, and when she went in to see
what was the matter Walker was closinp
the knife with his left hand and remarked
to Waldron, "Now you can go to a hos
pital."
Walker then ran from th<? room, fol
lowed by the bellboy, who chased him to
the Leepalmer House, where he has a
room. He eluded the bellboy by passing
out by the rear door. The bellboy re
turned to the Palmerlec House and tele
phoned to police headquarters.
Detectives Reynolds and Halley were on
duty and they hurried to the Palmerlee.
By that time a physician had been sum
moned and Waldron's wounds had been
dressed. Waldron refused to make a

The oil men of California, having ac
cepted an invitation from the California
Miners' Association to attend the conven

portunity is excellent for a general dis
cussion of the grievances of the oil pro
ducers. The oil producers complain that
transportation rates are very high. They
are aware -that the "scrippers" are not
dead, notwithstanding the setback they
have Judicially received. They are. In
terested in such mining legislation as may
be proposed. From Los Angeles, Kern,
Fresno, Ventura, Santa Barbara and sev
eral other counties they are ' coming to
San Francisco to counsel with the other
miners and to take part in shaping the
proceedings of the California Miners'
Convention. Men who have been exten
sively connected with mineral production
are now also -largely identified with the
oil-producing Industry.
There are many propositions which the
oil producers are seriously considering.
Some sections are yet without rail trans
portation facilities and this has given
rise to talk about pipe lines. The petro
leum miners in the counties north of Te~.
hachapl have already, demonstrated thei
richness of many fields and exploitation is
beginning, with more or less capital back
of it, in other localities. The current
week bids fair to make history for the oil
producing industry of California.
People in . Southern California have
heard of the acquisition of oil lands by the
Standard Oil Company, of which mention
has been made in The Call. The Los An
geles Herald says:
The Standard, with an eyÂ» to business, as
is Its habit, has waited until California has
proven Itself an oil producing: State of no
small degree before showing any desire to have
a hand in the business. That the Standard
Oil Company will be doing business In the
State on -an extensive scale within the next
two years, both as a buyer and producer, there
seems no doubt. Opinions differ as to the
effect it will have. Some prominent oil men
of the State stand In mortal . terror lest tha
entire -business be gobbled up and the poor
producer ground out of existence. Others, an.1
especially the . Kern Â¦ River . operators, see no
cause for worry. Certain it is that (or tht
best interests of the Industry there should be
some system In the way of marketing the pro
duct, whether the Standard Oil Company fur
nish the system, or some other large corpora
tion with equal facilities. As a general prop
osition the producers in California are indif
ferent, acting on the assumption that the State
is large enough for even the Standard -Oil
Company to do business In without injuring
the prospects of every Individual well owner. -
There was a large slump in the new
production of the oil fields of Pennsyl
vania for the month of October. The
number of wells completed was 766
and 182 were failures. The new produc
tion of the month amounted to 11,565 bar
rels. On October 31 there were reported
464 rigrs and 706 drilling: wells under wav,
which was a falling oft in new wells of 30
as compared with the September record.
President Crane of the California Pe
troluem Miners' Association will probably
soon complete the committee of seven
which la to call upon the Southern Pacific
and Santa Fe Railway companies to ask
for a new rate for the moving of crude
petroleum. General Hart, who has been
appointed chairman of the committee, has
expressed the opinion that It will be pos
sible to secure a 30-cent rate, approxi
mately 25 per cent of the value of the
product, for moving it.
The oil interests around Santa Maria
are reported by. letter to have received
quite an Impetus during the last week.
A correspondent reports that oil has been
found in the Western Union Company's
well on the Carriaga ranch, and that the

The scene at the church door fairly lifts
one from one's feet/ so full of spirit, fire
and life was !t, and the favorite march
was given In heroic fashion.
To cee "Lohengrin" thus given Is to feel
as if the pathetically beautiful dreams of
childhood were come true â a fairy tale
come to life. The knight of the holy
grail â or white swan. It makes no differ
enceâconr.es royally down the river to the
rescue of the distressed princess, clad in
all his silver a:mor. His inevitable love
for the princess and her final fatal cu
riosity, the awful "unhappy ending" of
the story, the jealous cousins, all are
there, clothed in cloth of gold, and an ut
most splendor of scenic surroundings.
The principals, inspired perhaps to best
effort by the appreciative atmosphere of
the house, outdid themselves. What a no
ble Nordica It was In the part of Elsa.
Here is her place, for nothing less than
the greatest, Wagner, calls forth the best
Jn her voice and heart. Mme.- Nordica has
studied uie role during the last year with
Mme. Wagner at Bayreuth. and shows
the effect of her most excellent training.
She looks the part every Inch and acts
with power and conviction.
The Ortrud, Mme. Schumann-Heink,
new to us before last evening, is a won
der. One thing most noticeable was the
marked similarity between the quality of
her lighter voice and that of Nordlca's.
It was all but impossible to tell when one
singer began and the other ended. Mme.
Schumann-Heink has a marvelously full,
rich, abundant voice, colorful to a degree,
extraordinarily sweet and expressive to
the last luxuriant thread of it. She acts,
too, with passion and power, and pos
sesses In a high degree the difficult art of
declamando.
She has the "grand air." too, which
seems to be characteristic of most of Mr.
Grau's artists, and wears her royal robes
as to the manner born. Her duet with
Elsa, in which she taunts and twits' the
hapless Princess with her prospective
husband's apparent lack of a grandfather,
was a marvel of suggestion, her voice
changing chameleon fashion with each
dominating emotion. Mme. Schumann-
Heink is a great singer.
Van Dyck was delightful as Lohengrin.
He sang a little doubtfully at first, but
warmed to his work and gave us a fine
rendering of the sliver knight's part. His
entrance, first winning about the river
on his swan ship, which waa manipulated
without any of the usual dot-and-carry
one effect with which we are haplessly
familiarâ was a most effective affair, and
throughout he Is a picturesque and im
pressive figure.
Telramund was. splendidly sung and
acted by Mr. Blspham. Though his voleÂ©
lacks the last fineness, it has that which
counts even more heavily in the score, a
kind of heart-reaching quality, a rare ar
dor and tender fiber, and his Telramund
was nobly played.
Edouard de Reszke was the king
imagine the cast!â and his big, abounding,
pnul-satlsfying basso played a royal part.
Mr. Muhlmann did good service as "der
Heernfer des Koenigs."
This reads rather like an adjectival de
bauch, a long descent into the sin of the
superlative, but to those who were
"among those present." if such chance to
read, I am eure the one quality most ap-
parent will be Its exquisite moderation!
To-night Nordica will be again heard In
the favorite "Trovatore," with Mr. Dippel
as Manrico, and Mme. Olitzka as Azu
cena. The performance will be in eveiy
respect equal to those of the week-day
programmes, and the prices will be from
one to three dollars a seat.
The best house of the season so far
greeted Donizetti's "Lucia" yesterday aft
ernoon at the Grand Opera-house with the
divine Melba in the name role, and the
frank melodiousness of the old Italian
was surely never better given, nor more
heartily enjoyed.
Melba surpassed herself. She acted
with a fine and delicate art for which
only such conception as her Marguerite
could have prepared one. She was the
loving, palpitating, fearful girl, caught In
the mesh of cruelest circumstances; a ten
der and pathetic figure. And, strangely
enough, the Edgardo was irresponsive,
timid and cold, yet not strangely, for it
must severely tax the singer whose voice
must come in close harmonious competi
tion with the marvelous note of Melba.
Her voice suggests as no other voice the
word "purfect." It is the voice of which
one has! dreamed, dropping the "silver
chain of sound of many links without a
break." It Is as the "lark who at heav
en's gate sings,"' crystal clear, each note
pure as a pearl, from the merest silken
thread of a sound, to a round, full, vic
torious note of an infinite deliciousness
of satisfaction.
The suggestion of technique in the con
nection seems a fallacy and a supersti
tion, yet it must be remembered that here
to nature has been added perfect art, that
highest art which conceals art. She has
a wonderful staccato, drip-dripping Its
light, an'd liquid note into the harmonious
chalice of the orchestra or flying sheerly
heavenward, where the angels probably
make it over for home consumption. The
twinkling turns, trills, roulades of the
"mad scene," with a perfect sympathy of
flute accompaniment, were rapturously
applauded, curtain call after curtain call
to the tune of eight or ten being de
manded.
Mr. Cremonini. the Edgardo of the cast,
was also accorded a very full share of
applause, more particularly for his work
in the last act, which, though constantly
interrupted by an insistent and irritating
accompaniment by the able-bodied voice
of a prompter, was yet a musically satis
fying performance. Cremonini's voice has
a certain rugous quality, but it Is of sym
pathetic timbre, and he has a good, clear
exeoution. His acting is self-conscious
and lacking in authority, but there was
evidence of dramatic power in .the mar
riage scene, though In the last scene the
artist was at his best.
As Enrico Ashton, Mr. Campanari
showed himself a very efficient substitute
for Mr. Scotti, who was indisposed. His
concerted work with Melba was distin
guished by a fine discretion and ail ex
cellent sympathy. Mr. Bars was a manly
Arturo. and Mr. Journet did rood service
as RaJmondo. The "Infelice^' 'was well
given, but not to astonishment, and the
famous sextet was splendidly rendered.
The orchestra, under Mr. Mancinelli'*
direction, was Just where it should be, a
luminous, shifting: background, a pervad
ing perfume, an atmosphere rather than
an accompaniment. . . ; v

Samuel M. Shortridge spoke in a like vein.
Attorney General Tlrey L. Ford made the
closing speech of the evening.
I Â«m sorry that Alameda County has lost the
banner. As a San Franciscan I am devilish
glad that San Francisco got It. We say we
wonder at the vote of California and the vote
of San Francisco. It should have surprised.
no man and will not cause you to wonder when
you look back and remember how little the
common enemy had to say against the admin
istration. In no campaign haa there .been so
little personal assault or criticism of the de
tails of administration.
The grand old party must be careful in the
future There Is a great deal to be done. The
trusts which they talk so much aboutâ they,
the great corporations, owe their existence to
law and can be controlled by law. In these
years to come we shall regulate them in so far
as they stifle free competition. We shall take
care of Porto Rico and Cuba. The difficulties
we met with in Hawaii have paased and the
beautiful islands are thoroughly Americanized.
Will It be bo with the Philippines? Had the
treaty of Paris been promptly approved, thero
would- have been no mushroom . insurrection
headed by Agulnaldo. We shall take care of
the Philinplnes. And over all will wave this
flag the emblem of every blessing.
If I were a resident of Alameda County,
possessed of the usual Alamedan's greed for
the rood things in the way of public office. I
would feel no envy of San Francisco, but re
joice with her in the majority she gave Mc-
Klnley. I desire to express the thanks of my
colleagues to the Republican clubs for the loy
alty that has made possible our great Republi
can victory.
General W. H. L. Barnes spoke as fol
lows:
Colonel George Stone, chairman of the
State Central Committee, was the next
speaker. He paid:
This flag: represents the fidelity of Republi
cans whose memory will always be cherished
bv the party in this State: men whom I typify
when I mention the late Senator Denison and
the late Warden Hale. It represents not alone
the votes cast, but the work done and the Joy
that uplifts the crest of Republicans over their
great victory-
President Booth responded briefly on be
half of the club. The Union League Club
quintet sang a Fong about "When the flag
comes home."
Senator-elect R. S. Lukens. acting presi
dent of the alliance, was introduced In the
absence of the president. Felton Taylor.
He explained the conditions under which
the" banner is held, and that there should
be no misunderstanding In future he read
a deed of trust, in which those conditions
were stated. Continuing, he said:
It behooves us to accept this trophy with be
coming modesty, with a feeling that it is less
of a distinction to have won it now than a
reproach that we have not had it before. Mr.
President of the Union League Club, I now
have the honor to place this banner in your
keeping.
Alfred Bouvler, chairman of the County
Central Committee, accepted the banner
on behalf of the Republicans of San Fran
cisco. He said:
We are here to celebrate this evening: with
appropriate ceremony an event of great Im
portance to San Francisco and the State. It
is an event which proves that San Francisco
is fairly entitled to thÂ« banner for fidelity to
the principles of Republicanism. We congratu
late you on the splendid majority you fjave to
the statesman, soldier, diplomatâ William Mc-
Kinley. We feel also that Alamedi County,
with its smaller majority of 7647. has something
of which to be proud. We leave the banner
here feeliner certain that two years hence we
v/111 win it back.
A committee consisting of A. G. Booth,
A. S. Mangrum, D. E: McKlnlay, Samuel
Hendy, W. M. Abbott and Tlrey L. Ford,
directors of the Union League Club, and
J. F. McGlynn, secretary of the County
Central Committee,' accompanied by a
band, met the visitors at the ferry depot.
The officers of the alliance were taken
into carriages and the parade formed and
proceeded up Market street to the Palace
Hotel. The uniformed and torch-bearing
members of the alliance, with their color
bearer in the lead and after him a corps
of buglers, marched once around the Pal
ace court and then into the rooms of the
Union League Club, where they formeo.
three sides of a hollow square in front of
the speakers' platform. Behind them
prominent Republicans of San Francisco
gathered until no more standing room was
left in the clubrooms.
A.' G. Booth, president of the Union
League Club, called the meeting to order,
and Dr. George C. Pardee was introduced
to speak in behalf of the alliance. He
said In part:
The Oakland Republican" Alliance had a
painful duty to perform last night, but
the stalwarts from across the bay did it
with a grace and good fellowship begot
of their confidence that two years hence
the conditions would be reversed. They
surrendered the silken banner ,to the Re
publicans of San Francisco, but every
man of their speakers gave fair warning
that they intended winning it back by
surpassing San Francisco's Republican
majority at the next election.
Tho banner was brought over from Oak
land in state. The alliance, with eighty
men in uniform, had the custody of it,
and the most prominent Republicans of
Alameda County accompanied the proces
sion. A band was part of the parade of
the visitors.

San Francisco did Itself proud last night
et the grand opera with "Lohengrin". for
the menu. There was a crowded house,
a brilliant and most sensitively apprecia
tive audience, and the glitter of countless
diamonds, fher-n of white shoulders, royal
fur? and pric*>Ipfs laces to add grace and
lovc-'.iness To the festival.
A most rarely sensitive audience It was.
A corps of Bo'f-constituted censors of ap
plause took charge of affairs eulogistic.
and at every disposition on the part of
the cvor-^nthusiaFtic hearers to untimely
commendation, promptly hissed the un
fortunates into a wholesome silence. But
Â«Â«.t every scrap of opportunity the storm of
epplause burst forth again, and well
might It be so. with perhaps the most
vonderful performance that this immortal
company has yet given.
There is but one Wagner, and Dam
rosch is his prophet! He has eminently
the Inner ser.Fe and spirit of the great
German master, and a continual wender
and delight is the orchestral work under
fc:s direction. And what marvelous place
the Warner orchestra fills. Like the old
<;reek chorus, foreshadowing, defining,
explaining the Inner spirit and outward
circumstance of every pregnant moment.
A full marriage is It. a rich warp and woof
of song and instruments, and with finest
precision is Its color, light and place here
valued. ' â
The work of the chorus is equally ad
mirable. A splendid attack, voice qual
ity volume, shading. It has. and last night

climaxesâ toward the first act's endâ that

b awoke from a week of what
I seemed to be unintcrest in
the greatest musical and
artistic opportunity ever given to
the city in its history. For a week
the people of the city did not re
spond to the splendid call upon their
sympathies and their purses which
the Maurice Grau Opera Company
zvas making, but last night San
Francisco, in all its musical, ar
tistic and fashionable variety, re
deemed itself and gave token that
the traveling singers who have
come among us will not have come
in vain.
The opera was "Lohengrin"
better sung, better Â¦ acted, better
staged and better interpreted in its
wonderful suggestion than ever
before in this city. The audience
was one zvhich crozc-ded the theater
to the roof. It li'as a fashionable
throng, quite as gorgeously gowned
as that of Monday night, quite as
representative of the best elements
of the city, but more enthusiastic,
less conscious of its gozvns and
jewels, and more sincerely in sym
pathy with what it had come to see
end hear.
It was attentive from the first
rustic of the curtain to the last
moan of the orchestra. It ap
plauded, "bravocd" cheered. It
commanded and was given time
after time curtain recalls, and
when it was all over it went out
into the rain well satisfied that it.
had paid tribute to men and
women who deserve the best which
San Francisco can give them.
Last night in the Grand Opera
house was one of the most brilliant
artistic triumphs in the history of
the city, and it is to be hoped that
it will be but the beginning of a
scries which will end only with the
engagement.

READY TO BEGIN THE CONSTRUCTION
OF A DRYDOCK OF GIGANTIC SIZE
The hearing in the Dubols contempt
case was continued * yesterday before
United States Commissioner Heacock.
Metson, the attorney, occupied the stand
during almost the entire day. â¢ At the
close of the examination Pillsbury put
Attorney A. S. Halsted of Los Angeles
on the stand. to elicit from him what was
said during a conversation at which he
had been present and in which Attorney
Knight and a man named Reese, who had
made an affidavit reflecting on the char
acter of Judge Noyes, took part.
Ex-Congressman Geary commenced and
finished the cross-examination of Met
son. He failed, however, to elicit any
thing differing materially from the at
torney's evidence of the day previous.
"A man named Breslan," who had been
connected as canvasser with the Nome
water works, and subsequently did a lit
tle detective work for Metson, was the
central point about which Geary's exam
ination, revolved. It was elicited that
Breslan had put It about In Nome prior
to Judge Noyes' arrival there that tho
Judge was a most estimable man. Upon
the arrival of the steamer carrying Judge j
Noyes Breslan went out to meet him. On
his return he Informed inquirers that the
Judge had changed. He had grown long
hair, and did not seem to be a fitting,per
son to occupy the office, which he waa to
Cross-examination as to what had con
stituted the basis for Breslan's claim of
the Judge's friendship, Metson said that
he believed it to be based on the fact that
the latter and Breslan had been drunk
together in Minneapolis. , ,
It also transpired on cross-examination
that a detective in Metson's employ
named Crowley had occupied* rooms next
to those of Judge Noyes and had had the
latter under observation through perfora
tions in the dividing wall.
Geary directed his greatest efforts to
an endeavor to shake Metson's testimony
as to the manner in which the attorney
alleged the Jury-box in Judge Noyes
court had been stuffed With the names
of those adverse to his cause. This led
to some very Interesting information re
lating to Metson's system of using detec
tives, and the number and standing of the
"sour dough" community. In connection
with the latter, folk the witness was asked
If he knew. Sam Dunham, a poet, who
wrote what was known in the camp as
"sour dough" poetry. - Dunham .was at
the. time' a census enumerator and .be
tween intervals of work invoked the
muses in opposition to Metson's clients.
In this connection the witness was
asked: "Didn't you. know Sam Dunham
was the Census Marshal employed by the
Government, and that he forwarded a re
port to headquarters in which he said
that Blakl was the original discoverer of
gold in Anvil Creek and therefore enti
tled to the Discovery mine?"
"I learned later that he .was the Cen
sus Marshal." -
Later Metson said he had some samples
of the "sour dough" muse In his pocket
and offered to read them, but on the ad
vice of Attorney Plllsbury. refrained.
Then the question came round as to the
part 'Major Strong had played "in the
case. Strong was one of the two com
missioners appointed by Judge Noyes to
draw a Jury. The other was Bortsche
nius, clerk of the court. Geary proceed
ed on this line as follows:
"You knew that Bortschenlus was a
Republican, while Strong was a Demo
crat?"
"Yes, sir."
"Did you know that Bortschenlus was
friendly to the Swede elementâ to your
clients?" . .
"I do not know as to that."
"Who told you that Strong had put
names of persons friendly to the plaintiffs
into the box?"
"Attorneys, and others." ;
"Their names?"
"Albert Fink was one of the attorneys."
"Who else?"
"A detective."
* "What was his name?"
"Carson. I knew him as."
"Did you not know that Carson was em
ployed by both sides?"
"I did not. Not at that time."
Geary went on to cross-examine and
finally elicited that It was some time be
fore Metson "got onto" Carson.
"How long before you discovered he
was playing both ends against the mid
dle?" was asked.
"Oh, pretty early In the game."
"How early?"
"About a month after I employed him."
â¢ "How many detectives did you run in
your bureau?" was the next question.
Metson replied that he had a permanent
staff of three or four, namely, Carson.
Allen, Crowley and Herrin.
"Now," continued Geary, "wasn't it a
fact that that Jury list was made "up -of
'sour doughs'?"
â¢ "I don't know," said the witness.
On further questioning It came out that
the Grand Jury had been composed of
"sour doughs."
Asked If it was not a fact that he knew
every night what took place In the Grand
Jury room Metson said -he knew It from
his detectives. . . .
"But you knew of the cases where no
indictments were foundâ the secrets of the
Grand Jury?" . ,
"Some of them." .
The account of how Clerk Bortschenlus
collected a Jury was interesting and
brought up Breslan's name. The latter
came to Metson on behalf of the clerk,
who was a stranger, and asked the attor
ney If he wduld not suggest some name:
to him. * fi.-'J
"Did you furnish them?" asked Geary.
"I did not."
"Did not Jackson furnish him with a
list of names?"'
"I don't think so." ;.; :
Metson was. then pressed to tell who it
jras that made the statement that Noyea
had announced what his charge would be
In the case. The attorney could not an
swer at first, claiming it was embodied Jn
his detectlvo reports, which he had left
at Nome. Finally he said that he thought
Detective Herrin had been his informant.
"Did you not say a little while ago that
you knew Herrin to be In the employ of
the other side?" was asked.
"I did," *.vas the reply.
"Then, knowing this, how did you credit
what he said?" .
"I did not credit It. I credited no one."
"Then of what use were . your detec
tives?" asked Geary.
"I had' them shadowed," naively re-
plied Metson.
. In the afternoon the examination start
ed off again with Metson on the stand.
Geary was anxious to know about De
tective Crowley. who occupied thÂ© room
next to Noyes' chambers In the Hirschler
Block. In reply to a question as to when
he put Detective Crowley Into the rooms.
Metson said that he was not aware of the
fact until told of It.
"Did you know that the dividing wall
had been perforated?"
"I did."
Then came a discussion as to whether or
not Metson had seen a secret service re
ceipt signed by Frost's detectives. Pressed
on this point. Metson said he wasn't sura
of Its being a receipt.
The Inquiry then passed on to the In
cident of Breslan's reception of Judge
Noyes. Geary asked If It were not a
fact that Breslan boasted of being Xoyes*
intimate friend In Minneapolis.
Metson said he did not know.
"I want an answer," said Geary. I
"Well, If you must have it. ha did say
they had got drunk together."
Geary looked nonplussed and Plllsbury
"Suppose we admit, Mr. Geary, that this
Indicates a degree of intimacy.'*
Geary was equal to the occasion, how
ever, and came right back with, "Cer
tainly. If that constitutes your standard
of friendship."
Metson admitted that Breslan said he
was disappointed in Noyes, whom he had
not seen for some years. He said that
he had let his hair grow and he "didn't
think he would do."
"His opinion of Noyes changed then
after he had visited him on the ship?"
said Geary.
: "1 suppose *v."
"Don t you think it was because Noyes
didn't seem Inclined to appoint him to an
office?"
"It may have been. I don't think so.*
"Didn't you think It peculiar that a man
should go out to meet an old friend and
then come back and say his hair was long
and that he wouldn*t do? What do you
think this indicated V
"1 thought It showed he didn't think
Noyes square."
"Didn't you thlrtfe It Indicated that he
had met with some disappointment?*"
"I did not."
Metson denied that he knew that Bres
lan had gone to Washington shortly after
to file charges against Xoyes.
Attorney Plllsbury called to the stand
Attorney A. S. Halsted of Los Aneelea.
Halsed said that he had shared Samuel
Knight's cabin on the way down from
Nome and had been a witness to a conver
sation between a man named Reese and
Knight. Knight asked Reese In Halsted's
presence if everything he had stated in an
affidavit reflecting on Noyes was correct.
Re^se said It was so and in answer to
Knight's question said he had received no
money from the attorney but his expÂ«nses
to New York. Knight then asked if he.
would testify to the allegations in the
affidavit in any court. Reese replied:
"In any place but Nomeâ anywhere ho
could get a square deal."
After a brief cross-examination by
Geary, the inquiry adjourned till Tuesday
next at 10:3) a. m.

downs oftener than their opponents.
While the Oregon team won on merit,
Its supremacy was due to natural condi
tions. The field was wet and heavy and
the Webfooters floundered .. through . the
mud joyfully. They seemed to like it.
California was on a foreign, soil. The
Berkeley backs could not get under way
and in no play was there any semblance
of formation. .. During most of the game
Smith was relied upon for punting and the
veteran halfback could not flo the trick.
Ah a result Oregon always gained on an
exchange of punts. Knowing his' team's
weakness in that respect, Womble, Cali
fornia's field captain, â¢-, took dangerous
chances on the third down! .and in that
way lost possession of the ball six times.
On the other hand, Oregon always punted
on the third down, even If there was but
half a yard to gain. The Webfooters
did not lose the ball a single time on
downs, though they were forced to punt
on twelve occasions. In. probably a third
of these instances they would :have made
their distance if they had chosen to take
the chances. . :
The California team was far from its
strongest. Johnny -More did not play
quarter, Clny and Prlngle were out of the
line, and for most of the game neither
Braley nor Overall was at fullback. None
of the backs could punt, both guards and
left tackle and the speedy backs were out
of . It on account of -the muddy field. The
visitors from the north showed a decided
improvement over their form in the game
a week earlier wit,h Stanford. They
played .with more confidence. Their tack
ling was cle'an and hard and seldom failed
THE University of Oregon football
team defeated the University of
California eleven yesterday after
noon by that most unsatisfactory
of scoresÂ»~2 to 0. The Oregon vic
tory was most unexpected and the vic
tors were as surprised as the vanquished.
The winning points were scored on a
safety, the result of a bad pass by De
coto, the Berkeley quarter.
It was California's ball on the ten-yard
line, where Oregon had sent It by a punt.
Decoto Intended to pass it to Smith, but
the pigskin went wide of the mark and
rolled over the goal line. Decoto fell on
the ball just in time to save It from an
Oregon man, making it a safety Instead
of a touchdown.
This blue and gold malfeasance ocÂ«
curred twelve minutes after play began
In the first half, and during the remainder
df the game neither goal was in danger at
any time.
The Oregon men fairly outplayed their
opponents. By judicious punting they
kept the ball In California territory.
But once in the first half and only three
times In the second half did the Berkeley
men carry the ball beyond the center of
the field. The Oregonlan fullback out
punted the California punter. The Ore
gon center trio outplayed. their opponents.
Then again the Webfooters fumbled less
and gained possession of the ball on
to stop the California runner in his
tracks.
The two points of the safety wera
scored In this manner: Oregon won the
tofes and kicked off, Payne sending the ball
down the field to the 25-yard line. After
two assaults on the line that netted but
little California punted back to the center
of the field.'. Two downs and no gain and
Oregon punted to the 25-yard line. Cali
fornia was forced to punt and Smith's low
kick was blocked. Oregon's ball. Payne
punted to the 10-yard line. California was
forced to punt. Smith kicking to the"S5-.
yard line. Oregon 'could not gain, and
Payne punted 25 yards: Then Gammon
got 23 yards through center, and a punt
gave Oregon the ball at the center of the
field. Oregon punted 25 yards and then
took the ball from Berkeley on downs.
Another punt of 20 yards left the ball on
the 10-yard line. Here it was that Decoto
made his bad pass and the safety was
scored. The teams lined up as follows:

The only score of the game was made
late In the first half. Navada had worked
the ball down to Stanford's forty-yard
line. After two ineffectual trials /to ad
vance the ball, Keddle fell back and
punted to Geissler, who was playing back
for the cardinal. The ball would have
bounded safely over the goal line and out
of bounds had he not put It In touch by
toying with it. Meantime Smith, Neva
da's left end, covered the oval. It was
Nevada's ball on Stanford's two-yard
line. Keddle was tried and advanced the
oval to within two feet of the last white
line. Again he shot Into the line of cardi
nal Jerseys, and the game was won for Ne
vada. The brilliant full back added more
laurels to his credit by placing the mud
coated ball squarely between the goal
posts, and Nevada's rooters on the aide
lines went wild. It was the first tlmÂ« an

of a clear sky it struck the Stan

test with the Nevada State University
team on the Palo Alto field. When It was

CRUISER SURPRISES
THE FORM PLAYERS
Form players had things much their
own way in the run-down of the big open
stake yesterday at Union Park. Out of
sixfy-four courses run short-enders were
successful ' in ten. J. H. W. .Muller's
Cruiser was due to give the talent his
periodical exhibition of getting the flag
from a hot favorite and performed his
end of the contract in a creditable man
ner. Drawn against McComb's fast Sir
Pasha, Cruiser looked like easy money to
the wise ones, and as a result of their
figuring the good price of 7 to 1 could be
had against ius* chances.
Floodgate had easy going arid Is looked
upon as a likely candidate for honors in
to-day's finals. Sisquot: is performing well
find is expected to reach well along on the
card. Greenhall, Lady Claire, For Glory
and Fiery Face are figured to get some
of the big end of the stake for their own
ers. Fiery Face is in shape to repeat her
creditable work of last week.
Auckland and Golden Russet should put
up an even go in the second round and
Master Claire has the clas3 over Shadow,
though he had a hard go and a narrow es
cape with Lucretia Borgia, winning only
by the kill. The other winners look to be
Crawford Rex, First Foot, Cash. Emma
M. Olita, Mose, Master Rocket. May
Hempstead, Castaway, Kanaka. Belle
Rocket. Golden Garter. Mac's Melody.
Frosty Morn. Belle Claire. Theron, Bad

SAN FRAXCISCO took the first
game of the series with Stockton
yesterday afternoon .at Recreation
gro'unds. Two more such feathers
in Uncle Henry's cap will mean a
clo*e finish in the race for the league pen
nant of 1900. The score was 7-1.
Mr. Johnson, occasional twirler for
Stockton, beseechingly asKed Jim Mc-
Donald to turn his eyes loose on the
game. This happened in the second Inn-
Ing. After that Mr. Johnson was turned
looser-on the benches, where he remained
throughout the game.
"Get In the game," said Johnson to
Umpire' McDonald, Just because he
thought one of his specially prepared
curves that was called a ball was In re
ality a strike,
"You get out of It," said McDonald.
Johnson did as he was told, with reluc
tance and muffled criticisms. "Too much
insolence for a young, stout man," said
McDonald as Whalen walked into the
box- to finish the work of the ejected Mr.
Johnson.
Whalen, who has been a sufferer with
appendicitis, was not strong yesterday
and the Hanxmen found him readily. In
the fifth inning he was undone, and after
a smashing all over the Held the boy at
the bell rang six times for Frisco. This
is how It; happened: Rellly hit safely, fol
lowed by Iburg with a sacrifice. Then
Brockhoff hit to right and Graham, miss
ing the throw-in. Reilly scored. Hllde
brand went a-cantering on four bad ones,
and Krug on a hit to right field tilled the
bags. A hit by Pabst to McCarthy scored
Brockhoff and HUdebrand, and a hit by
Schwartz scored Krug and Pabst. By
some rare errors Schwartz scored. Runs
six and hltB four was the product. In
the seventh Schwartz scored again.
In" the second inning the Milllers
scored. Babbitt srot a base on balls, icor
lns on two succeeding- singles.

It was necessary for the authorities to

Even with such an escort the attack was

ATTACKED THE PLAYERS.
THE hitherto Invincible Pat Morris
ppv, who usually chirps and chat
ters like a monkey juggling cocoa
nuts when started during umbrella
time, nearly bankrupted two-thirds
of the big Saturday crowd at Oakland
yesterday. The hor^e with the Celtic han
dle to his name had a highly cultivated
following, who rÂ»anked on his winning the
Gulden Gate Falling stake in a canter.
The distance was seven furlongs and there
*-orÂ« but two other starters. Torsina and
Knrtnn. With "Monk" Coburn in the
sa<*dl<* end but 100 pounds to carry Pat
rinsed a 9 to 10 favorite. Tnrsina, it was
figured, might crack some ice, but as to
Horton. that was out of the question,
the talent saidâ he didn't fancy the go
ing. At the start Morrissey propped Just
for an instant, losing possibly a length",
but before the turn Â¦ into the backstretch
was reached was humming along, in the
lead. Horton vras up dangerously close,
end when about h?Uf the distance had
been traversed icplaced Torsina in second
position. As the stretch was reached
Johnny Woods astride t*ie leader turned
in his saddle, to perceive Horton at his
hrr!s. Picking the best going, on the
rldge.'he began urging Pat, but under Co
burn's riding Horton pained at every
stride. A furlong from home the latter
looked a handv winner, but the favorite
fought it out gamely, only losing at last
by a neck. Tnrsina cut a sorry figure,
showing no speed whatever.

In the opening sprint Un Cadeau, second
choice in the betting, ran away from a
cheap bunch- Dolore, the favorite, showed
in second position for a while, then tossing
it up. Spike was second, a neck in front
of Trevathan.
Bam Hildreth's colt Golden Age out
classed his field in the two-year-old num
ber shoes to .plates, and 1 to 8 was the
regular quotation. He won in a sneeze,
with Billy Lyons leading Argot over the
line for place honors.
Bookmaker Fred Cook certainly has a
mudlark In Hermoso. The big: chestnut
horse shouldered 122 pounds and won away
off from Mocorito and Imperious in the
fifth event. The winner was a pronounced
favorite and covered the six furlonjfs in
1:15, a very fast performance, all things
considered.
Although Sybarie had first call In the
booking. Uarda took the final run of the
day In a mild gallop. The old mare al
ways displayed a marked tendency for
heavy tracks, which accounted for her
price being cut from 5 to 3. Sybaris easily
disposed of Alicia for the place.

night by the San Francisco Vereln. An

several solos by Harry Samuels. The
great event of the evening, however was
contributed by Madame Gadskl the
famous Wagnerlan soprano. When she
sang "Fur Muslk" the audience listened
in silence till the last notes died away,
then broke into a storm of applause and
covered the stage with magnificent bou
quets. Never can the great singer have
received a more heartfelt ovation. She
had to clng several times more before her
entranced audience would permit her to
rest. Gadskl'e accompanlBt was Mrs

YOUNG HARASZTHY WAS
HERO OF THE ROMANCE
Miss Columbia von Schmidt "Was Ba
trothed to the Son and Not
the Father.
The mystery that coupled the name of
Miss Columbia von Schmidt and that of
the late Arpad Haraszthy has been all
cleared away. A romanc^ bound the old
gentleman and the fair young stenogra
jjher. but the deceased was not the hero
of the story.
Five years ago Miss von Schmidt and
Carlos Haraszthy, the young son of the
champagne man, were engaged to be mar
ried. The engagement Â¦was afterward
broken off, and while Carlos went off to
France his father never lost interest in
the girl who was to have been his daugh
ter-in-law.
"Mr. Haraszthy and my family had been
intimate friends for many years." said
Miss von Schmidt yesterday. "He was
very kind to us all and we owed to him
many favors. When I graduated from
business college I went Into Mr. Harazs
thy's employ and continued with him for
several years. After a while my health
failed me and I sought other employment,
work that did not confine me so 'to my
desk. In my search for a different kind
of work I had the assistance and Influ
ence of Mr. Haraszthv. Five vears ago I
was engaged to his son Carlos. The en
gagement was broken off. I was never
engaged to Mr. Haraszthy, and there was
never a question of such a thing between
us."
Miss von Schmidt was In charge of the
Children's Bureau at the Midwinter Fair,
and lt~Tra*Hn her charge that the Infant
who was abandoned at the exposition was
placed. Miss von Schmidt has since
adoptod the little waif, who under her
care has grown into a tine, attractive lit
tle girl.
FILL-BLOODED INDIAN WILL BOX
BEFORE BAY CITY ATHLETIC CLUB
J e Gregg Takes to the Warpath and Is After the Scalp o
the Clever Young Pugilist, Charles Hawley.
WAR-WHOOPS will rend the
atmosphere at the monthly
bcrxing exhibition of the Bay
City Athletic Club to-morrow
evening, but the blood-curd-
Ilngr yells will pour from the throats of
palefaces gathered around a roped arena
to watch a full-blooded Indian do battle
with a white man. The brave will again
listen to familiar cries and the encourag
ing shouts, although they come from hid
traditional enemy, will cheer him on to
victory.
"Indian" Joe Gregg has taken the war-
Fiath, but he has laid aside the* tomahawk
or the more modern weaponâ the boxing
glove. He will do battle with Charlos
Hawley, a lusty youth who outfought
clever Salisbury at tne last fistic enter
tainment given by the club. The redman
swears he will take Hawley'" scalp, but
the latter expects to fool his foe by en
tering the ring with his hair cropped
close, and in condition to make the fight
of his life.
Ring-goers of this city have recently
watched the antics of a Chinaman in the
ring and have In the past seen boxers of
almost every nationality answer the call
of the gong, but they have yet to see an
Indian in action. Great curiosity, there
fore, has been manifested among follow
ers of the pastime to see Gregg In the
ring. He has come to this city unherald
ed, but that he Is a dangerous opponent
In the ring is attested by his many vic
tories " He Is short and stocklly built,
broad of shoulder and lithe of limb. He
la a full-blooded Chinook. His half
brother has won fame as a member of
the Carlisle Indian football team. Gregg is
a fairly clever boxer, and a terrific hitter.
That he does not lack courage and ability
to take punishment was manifested two
days ago, when he withstood the heavy
punches of Henry Lewis, f ne colored
nsrhter. who tried him out.
The club will present seven preliminary
bouts. Bert Crowder will box four rounds
with Tom Hale: Johnny Ware meets Wil
liam Snallem: Joe Allen boxes Jim Kelly:
Peter Coleman meets George Merrltt: Joe
Sullivan fights Jim Carney; Oscar Wilson
does battle with William O'Brien, and
Jack Sullivan will meet Jim Ryan.

A feature of the entertainment was the
competitive cakewalk between Vera Lltz
and Ed Litz and Robbie Stack and Edna
Martin. Both couples gave a pretty ex
hibition of the popular fad. the two last
named children doing some exceptionally
fine work on tip toes. The applause was
to have decided who won the contest, .but
Professor O'Brien was obliged to call it
a draw as both pair appeared to be equal
favorites.
The successful affair was under the
management of Miss Estelle Carpenter,

CAPTAIN COBLENTZ AND
M. LTTZARICHO IN A DUEL
Witnesses Stop the Contest After the
French Officer Receives
Three Wounds.
PARIS. N'ov. 17.â The Coblentz affair is
becoming an issue likely to les.d to liii
ther anti-Semitic feeling In the army cir
cles. A few days ago M. Lebaudy, the
well-known turfman, issued the usual In
\-ltatlon to the officials of the school at
Fontalnebleau to take part in a hunt.
Captain Coblentz. among other officers,
accepted the Invitation, but when he ap
peared the Lebaudys abandoned the hunt
on account of the incident at the Auteull
races on November 4 and Its outcome.
As a result of this trÂ«r*ment on tne day
of the Lebaudys' nunt Captain Coblentz
sent seconds to Roger Luiaricho. a
brother-in-law of Lebaudy, and a duel
with swords was fous?ht this afternoon.
In the second assault Captain Coblentz
received a slight laceration of the fore
arm and in the fourth assault he was
twice wounded In the same arm, one of
the sword thrusts penetrating the cubital
nerve, after which the witnesses stopped
the contest.
The commanding officer of the Fontalne
bleau School has forbidden the officers of
that Institution and the pupils from par
ticipating hereafter In the Lebaudy hunts.

been remedied.
In the matter of animal transport tha
United States contingent of the Chines
expeditionary force Is conceded to be the
superior of any. except, perhaps, tho
splendidly equipped Indian pack trains of
the British. The big army wagons and
large mules have been greatly admired

The text of the veto by the Mayor of
the bill cf the Secretary of State for the
official ballot paper furnished to this city
end county for the last general election
vas made public yesterday. The reason
given for the veto Is that the charge for
the paper was "greatly in t excess of the
ir.arket rates." He leaves the matter to
the determination of the Board of Super
visors. The full text of the veto is as fol
lows:
To the Honorable the Board of Supervisors
cf the City end County of San FranciscoâGen
t'.eir.en: I herewith return to you without my
f-rproval & demand upon the treasury in favor
< r the Secretary of State for $725. being for 293
r-ams of bailot paper. 15*4x25* In *iie. at $2 50
r-er ream, which Is equivalent to 12*- cents a
jocund.
My attention has been called by the Registrar
at Voters of this city and county to the fact
that this la an excessive price. In proof whereof
I inclose j-ou coptea of letters received by him
from Mesera. Blake, Moff.tt & Towne, Bones
tell & Co. and the Santa Clara Valley Paper
Company, showing that the paper can be
bought as low as 6 cents per pound In the open
market, whereas the bill rendered is at the rate
of 12Vj cents per round.
I have ascertained that Secretary of State
Curry did not invite bids for ballot paper and
Fave it to the contractor without competition,
as we have seen, at a price greatlv In exces*
r-t the market rates. The whole amount of the
j'urchase made by the Secretary of Btate was
JD400. which at 6 crats a pound, the apparent
market price, should have amounted to only
$2160.
The Secretary of State la obliged to furnish
the counties with ballot paper at coet, but the
quertlcn is what protection have the counties
.â¢" ca:r.n excessive cost imposed upon them by
the Peeretary of State? Â«â¢
I 4Â«m it icy duty to leaÂ»e this matter ror
the determination of the Board of Supervisors.
lleepectTuIljr eabmiitefl.
JAMLXJ D. PHELAN. Mayor.
The Supervisors will consider the veto at
their regular meeting to-morrow. Mayor
Phelan refers to Registrar Walsh as his
authority for the charges he makes
against the office of the Secretary of State
in his communication. Registrar Walsh
has made other statements. He has ob
jected to the size of paper sent down
from the office of the Secretary of State
because it was not largs enough to make
two ballots of and Â¦was too large for one,
so that the cutting involved waste of the
paper. He has objected to the slie on
another ground, which is that where only
one ballot could be gotten out of one
pheet, the press work was made twice as
jsrreat as it needed to have been and this
ii<>ded another expense to the cost of the
ballots. The average cost of the bailees
VMM one-half of one cent each before any
printing was placed upon them. These
matters he has talked freely about the
City Hall and it was upon his repre^nta
tions that the Mayor held up the bill,
which has already been passed by the
B<">ard of Election Commissioners.
The basis upon which Walsh has figured
Is that a ream of the paper that he, re
ceived from the Secretary of State
weighed twenty pounds on the scale? an<i
this was thÂ» way he reached the fact that
32^ cents per pound was the price of the
jiaper as billed by the Secretary of State's
office. He took samples of the ballot pa-
K-r personally to several paper houses.
Representatives of other houses visited
him at the Citv Hall and made written
offers to furnish the Fame groods at half
the price charged and less. All the coun
ties were charged 12"-~ cents per pound by
the Secretary of States office.

NEW TORK, Nov. 17.â A World special
from London says: From the latest in
formation obtainable in the Jockey Club' 3
stewards' investigations of Lord Dur
ham's charges against Jockey Relff and
Trainer Wlshard. it looks as If there are
stormy times coming for his Lordship.
It has just transpired that during tha
investigation the stewards called upon
Richard Croker's representative for Mr.
Croker 1 * betting books. This is an action
that is very humiliating to an English
man. It Is a step so grave that stew
ards rarely resort to it. It is a stigma
upon his good name, as It Implies a doubt
as to his honesty. A man whose betting
books have been called for, no matter
what the action of the stewards Is after
ward, is for a long time a suspected per
son.
Only time can eradicate these feelings.
It Is painful to an Englishman, but it is
doubly painful to an American and the
friends of Mr. Croker. who know his tight
ing proclivities, say Lord Durham will
have cause to regret his action. One of
the friends of the New Yorker said to
night that Mr. Croker's hurry to get back
to England was due to the demand for his
betting books. This action of the stew
ards was cabled to him. These books dÂ»<l
more than anything else to prove to the
stewards that the two races between
Richard CrOJser's The Scotchman II anÂ«l
Lrf>rd Durham's Gerolstein were truly and
honestly run. They showed that Mr.
Croker lost heavily at*Doncaster when.
The Scotchman II lost and that he ha<i
so little confidence in the horse that r.a
did not bet on him at all when he won
at Liverpool. It is now said Reiff's fu
ture action Â«iepend3 on Mr. Croker. The
Jockey is waiting for him to arrive. On
him depends whether Lord Durham will
be sued for libel.
The humiliation put upon Mr. Croker
by demand for his betting books wi'.l. hi*
friends think, cause him to urge Iteiff to
sue Lord Durham. This will not be the
first time a jockey has sued for dam
ages for libel. About twelve years ago
Sir George Chetwynd accused Jockey
Wood of "pulling" a horse. The Jockey
brought suit, carried it through several
courts and secured Judirment. Lord Dur
ham now faces probably the same fat-.
The true sportsmen here are happy that
hi? lordship, who la never popular, ha*
been proven wrong. Many hope he will
be sued.
When Besult Is Made Known
Beiff May Sue His Lordship
For Heavy Dam-
Investigation Into Charges
Made by Lord
Durham.

MONTREAL, Nov. 17. â Official an
nouncement Â«vas made this afternoon by
Sir Rivers "Wilson, president cf the Grand
Trunk Railway system, that George B.
Reeve, formerly traffic manasrer.had been
appointed general manager of the system,
to succeed Charles M. Hays, who is go
ing to San Francisco as president of the
Southern Pacific. Mr. Reeve3 is now on
his way to Montreal to confer with the
chief executives of the company. â¢ It. la
said President Wilson was governed in his
selection by the recommendation made a
week ago at New York by Mr. Hays.
From semi-official sources it was learned
to-night that F. H. McGuigan. general su
pcrlntendent of the Grand Trunk, had the
refusal of the lirst offer to become its
general manager. It is alsÂ»o undersood
that while no changes are contemplated
in any of the departments it is believed
several officials who have been with Mr.
Hays since his coming to Canada will join
him In California.
George B. Reeve, Formerly
the Traffic Manager, Is
Named.
Succeeds Charles M. Hays, Who Not
Long Ago Was Appointed to the
Presidency of the Southern

It Is of Small Proportions and Does
Little Damage, but All Kinds
of Stories Are
Told.
OAKLAND. Nov. 17.â The only building
that was ever struck by lightning In Oak
land is that owned by Henry Meyer on
the northwest corner of Sixth street and
Broadway, and the bolt fell in the little
storm that drenched Oakland for a few
moments last night. Mr. Meyer is very
proud cf this fact, even though he has
quite a little bill for repairs to settle, and
though he was given a decided shock in
more v ays than one last night.
Tlie MgMn'ng bolt was a little one that
strayed irem home and got lost in
darkest Oakland. It wasn't a full grown
bolt and ihe damage did not amount to
much, but the lack of damage was more
than compensated for by the excitement
of the moment.
There is a small saloon in the rear of the
building, and there were several in the
room who had gathered there, for pro
tection from the storm. While they wore
waiting for the little summer shower to
pass over there was an invitation to have
a drink, and the barkeeper was just en
gaged in mixing the concoctions when the
little thunderbolt got loose and began Its
antics.
The bolt tore the tin off the roof of the
building and then danced out upon the
cornice of the building and knocked a few
bricks off just to show that it wa6 alive
and could do "stums" If It only wanted
to. When the bricks began to fall Into
the street and clatter upon the sidewalk
the inmates of the saloon, who were wait
ing for their drinks, got a little excited.
Then the little thunderbolt gx>t entlrely
off the reservation and kicked up its heels
and wandered around upon the bar and
mixed a few thunder and lightning
cocktails and then left as suddenly as it
came.
There are all kinds of stories as to Just
what did happen In the saloon. One of
the Inmates swears that the bolt came
down the chimney and another is equally
positive that it came In the window. The
barkeeper says that it brought a brick
with It down the chimney and mixed the
brick and the mortar up~with his best
cocktail"?.
Every man in the room owears that the
bolt was a fullfledged. man-sized affair.
except a quiet man who sat in the corner
reading the morning paper. He says that
a few bricks dropped into the street and
the barkeeper became so excited that he
ppllled the cocktails and the rest of the
inmates of the room were too busv dodg
ing to know what happened. But the
quiet man In the corner had not been In
vited to take a drink, which may account
for his pessimistic criticism.
But the building was struck. Just the
same, and the cloudburst that visited
Oakland brought the heaviest rain that
ever fell here. It is estimated that three
quarters of an Inch of rain fell inside of
half an hour. The rainfall for the night
was over an Inch. --Â».

song birds have succeeded In diverting his
regretful' attention from the Inherent
absurdity of grand or any other form, of
opera, not even excepting the .Wagner-

course was it that the Queen should in
quire his preference as to the usual gift
presented under such circumstances,
doubtless expecting the customary re

haus. It always loomed up like a great
Juggernaut, especially in those early
dayÂ»; Siegfried took me the tlnÂ»t morn
ing to see the Interior of the theater. It
was raining. The empty seats stared at
me and the house looked so gloomy and
there was such an air about the whole
i?iace that 1 went home thoroughly dis
neartened. I thought, 'Why not give it
all up? It will not be so wonderful if I
cannot do it.' Then came the dread of
singing before the other artists, but after
the first rehearsal they all came to me
and 1 began to feel as much at home as
1 do here in America, The performance
seemed only like an additional rehearsal.
The darkness of the place made us forget
all about the audience, and we were only
sincere and intent upon our work. No
prompter is allowed at Bayreuth, and I
got so used to doing without one that
when I sang "Elsa' in other cities in Ger
many it became necessary for me to ask
them not to prompt me, as it only served
to disturb me.
"In the first performance at Bayreuth
another tenor had to be substituted for
Van Dyck, who was ill. After he got
out of the boat and started down the
stage he suffered a lapse of memory, and
turning around begged that some one help
him. The chorus came to his aid and
gave him the lines until he regained his
composure. After the last applause in
the festival the applause resulted in the
curtain being drawn up three times and
we were allowed to bow our acknowledg
ments, contrary to the accustomed rule.
They were still cheering when we were
dressed for the street and ready to leave
the theater. The Americans present at
the festival gave me a silver laurel wreath
with an inscription, and laurel wreaths
were sent to me by Siegfried and other
membere of the family.
"Regarding Siegfried Wagner I must
Fay that he is a man of great talent. He
is modest and studious, and my predlc
t.oa is that he will make a name for him
self in the world. One morning Herr
Kniese was ill and Siegfried directed the
'Lohengrin' rehearsal. On the conclusion
of the opera they cheered him, which
was quite unusuai, as they are not given
to that kind of thing at Bayreuth. It is
not yet decided what I shall sing
there next year; it is a long time ahead.
Mme. Wagner has lnvltea me, however,
to appear during the festival. I shall
not sing 'Isolde' anywhere until I havo
perfected the role as far as I am able
under her personal direction."

A very pleasing: affair was the vested
choir festival at St. Luke's Church or.
Thursday evening under the direction of
Wallace A. Sabin. Seven choirs were
represented, including 175 male voices,
and the long service was rendered with
fine precision and good effect throughout.
The choirs were kept well in hand by Mr.
Sabin and their Â¦work was distinguished
by an admirable balance and spirit, good
attack, phrasing and Intonation and not
ably good shading. The best number on
the. programme was perhaps "O Lord.
Our Governor," which was given with
splendid spirit and power, but the whole
service was a distinct encouragement to
those Interested In this high form of the
art musical.
Harvey Loy was at the organ and ac
companied the various numbers in ef
fective and competent fashion. The defec
tions of the organ Itself, a email and limit
ed Instrument, were responsible for the one
unfortunate feature of the whole pro
gramme. The organ lacks a trumpet stop
and to remedy the deficiency a couple of
Instruments were engaged to undertake
the numerous trumpet passages which
occurred In the movements Interpreted.
The Instruments were not In tune and
were rarely with the beat and oftener
marred than made the effect intended.
But It was, on the whole, a programme
to be proud of and year by year the work
shows an encouraging progress.
The service was as follows:
Organ prelude, "Andante,- Ronata VTI"

Baughan â and of her consequent Intent to
adopt the dramatic stage as her profes

ment.
We heard the .Â«ame rumor concerning
David Bispham last season, a rumor abso
lutely without foundation, us >Ir. Bisp
ham assures me, but then it is well known
that the artist has a very considerable
iiking for purely dramatic work. He is
already familiar with many of the
Shakespearean roles and as snon aa the
least hint of failing voice appearsâ may It
be farâ he will go Into the "legitimate."
One of Mr. Blspham's roles In tne coming
reason will probably be that of Benedick
in Dr. Vtlliers Stanford's new opera,
"Much Ado About Nothing."
"But when mention was made of my

would always have a little picnic. But I

Ftudled the words and positions with
Mme. Wagner every morning from 10 to
31. From 11 to 1 I studied the music of
the role with Herr Kniese. At 3 o'clock
I studied with the orchestral conductor,
who remained with me until 5. I then
took a short drive, but by the time it was
all through 1 felt ready to drop, and it
eeemed to me over Â«nd over a^ain that I
fhould never be able to accomplish thÂ»

was in the evening, when some of us went

of the arrangement is decided. Tne whole

"Will Not _Â«ave the Cabinet.
It Is In furtherance of this colossal deal
that Mr. Hill has decided to relinquish,
the presidency of the Great Northern to
his son. Samuel Hill, who is now general
manager of the company. Mr. Hill will
be chairman of the board of directors.
The dissolution of the Northern Paclno
voting trust, which becomes effective
January 1 next. Instead of a yeax later, a.i
originally proposed, will permit the dis
tribution of the stock of the company a*
above proposed and enable James J. Hill
to take control of the property.
Mr. Hill and several of his friends win
enter the directory of the Northern Paci
fic, some of Mr. Morgan's associates in
the Northern Pacific will be elected direc
tors of the Great Northern ana Union Pa
cific Interests will also have representa
tives In the boards of the other two north
ern railroads.
There is to be no consolidation or lease
of one property to another, for Messrs.
Hill and Morgan recognize that the law*
of certain Western States would not per
mit of such a thing. Mr. Morgan and Mr.
Hill, acting with the Deutsche Bank of
Berlin, which has always been a large
owner of Northern Pacific stock, have
pooled their Interests of Northern Paciflo
stock and have recently greatly added to
their holdings of Northern Pacific shares,
until they now have a majority In the>
great pool. This is to be turned over to
the Great Northern, giving the latter
control of Its rival. The Great Northern.
It la believed, will pay for this huge block
of Northern Pacific stock by the issue oC
new Great Northern common stock, or by
means of a new security yet to be deter
mined. ?
This statement Is officially made by onÂ©
of the hiehest executive officers of tha
Northern Pacific Company, who admit*
his company is about to pass under tnÂ«
control of the Great Northern, according;
to the long-cherished plan of J. J. Hlu.
of the latter road.
Mr. Hill is acting in close harmony with
J. Pierpont Morgan, who Is the chief fac

'â¢Trade last week showed marked Improve-

Ma".! ajflvlree *rom New Tork say:
made of transactions on the Stock Exchange,
except by the partlea immediately concerned,
gives the opportunity for unwarranted state
ments rec&rdlng the proportions of the mar
ket. On Monday of this week the total sales
w*rÂ» 1.64S.O0O shares, according to the most re
liable estimates, but for the week ending Tues
day evening conservative estimates show that
more shares were sold than in any previous
period in the history of the exchange. The
total amounted to 7,694,951 shares. For the
weÂ«k ending January 27, \m. the aggregate
sales were 7.432.S&5 shares. As for bond sales,
the total has not reached $6,000,000 par value on
any day since the election, while the record
stands ax about 111,000.000 par value. As for
the record of sustained period of activity, the
tales of stocks were constantly over a million
shares a day in January, 1899. During the
same period the bond sales were between thirty
and forty million dollars a week par value.
An almost equally bull market was that of
April, 1899, when the hordes of new industrial
securities were, offered on the market. It will
thus bÂ« seen that the speculation has hardly
attained the unbridled character of some former
periods. The memory of the results following
the epecul&tlon of 1S99 in industrials has not
been without influence this week in Wall
street An apprehension grew up in the street
after the collapse of the industrial boom in
1899 that those properties as a class would
have to go through an experience similar to
that of railroed companies following the ex
cesses of capitalization and stock Jobbing of
the construction era. The list of American
railways that have been in bankruptcy and re
organization is a long one. The- standards es
tablished consequently of publicity and In
formation regarding expenses, revenues and
fitianoes of railroad companies and the light
given to purchasers of the stock and lenders
of money on the securities, make a strong con
trast to the information allowed to the public
regarding the great industrial combinations.
This in many cases is confined to bare state
ments of net earnings. The effect upan'publio
confidence is evident from the low prites In tlie
market of many of the industri.-^ stocks on
which good dividends are paid and for which
tufflcient earnings ore reported to continue
dl\-idends. The general knowledge "of revival
of business activity and frood demand at nd
vandng prices for the product of the Indus
trial combines have dissipated some of the
distrust felt toward them. The absence, as a
rule, of heavy fixed -charges to be met before
earnings are available for dividends on stocks
of industrials, however, meet some objections
to them.
The prospect of new war loans in England
snd Germany affected our money market early
In the week, but with the belief that the Iseuo
of the loans would be deferred until early next
year. tbÂ« influence paseed and the money mar
ket became easier, thus contributing to the re
turning strength in the stock market.
.The bond market has conlnued active and
btf>ad, but the principal buying has bwj of
bofcds of speculative value or with contingent
interest payments.

NEW YORK. Nov. 17.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram eays: The
markets here were fairly active for Saturday,
the enthusiasm for Americans apparently in
fecting the other sections. Americans were
simply rampant on . big buying, both by the
Continent and London, the letter, however, be
ing mainly of a professional character. Union
Pacific issues were the great features and sev
eral others were extensively purchased in sig
nificant quarters. There was good buying
also of Northern Paclflo Issues. It was thought
that dealings In the street would be continued
until 6 p. m., though the house closed at 1-30
p. m. .
London Market-
WASHINGTON, Nov. H.-To-day's state
ment of the Treasury balances In the general
fund. : exclusive of the J150.000.000 gold reserve
In the division of redemption, shows: Avail
able cash balances, $136,970,311; gold, $92,456,?14.
Condition of the Treasury.
At the beginning of the revival in stock ex-
Change activity during January, 1899, the same
peculiarity in the loan Item was shown, al
though in a period of three or four wet-ks fol
lowing loans moved up over $30,000,000. At that
time the explanation now often used, namely,
the heavy volume of investment buying, was
advanced. It is probable that the loan and
cash fluctuations will within the next few
months Bhow some interesting phasrs, but a
continued heavy Increase In surplus reserve
would appear to be an anomaly in the face of
prevailing conditions. The deposits of the
banks rose $8,678,300 last week, as a result of
thft changes already noted, and this added to
the 12,144,675 for legal reserve requirements, ex
plains why the increase in surplus was not bo
large as the gain in cash. The money market
has not been affected to any extent by the re
vival in business since election. The circula
tion of the banks In New York has for the
moment reached Its maximum, decreases In
the total having been shown over the ' last
two weeks.
NEW YORK, Nov. 17.â The Financier says:
The New York clearing house made an un
expectedly good showing for the week ending
November 17, cash Increases having surpassed
all expectations. The gain footed up $5,253,200,
divided almost equally between legal tenders
an 1 specie. The Increase was due for the
most part to operations with the Treasury, al
though it Is known that New York gained ap
preciably during the week from the interior.
Then, too, a portion of belated gold imports
HKured In the reserve Item. With this strong
condition as a basis the banks were able to
stand the swelling of their other totals with
out trouble, and as the expansion in loans
was aleo under all previous calculations, they
cloced the week with $3,003, 725 added to their
excess reserve, bringing the total to $7,663,775.
The slowness with which the loans of the banks
respond to the enormous stock exchange ex
pansion noted since November 7 Is a rather
puzzling feature and one that Is variously ex
plained. It is quite probable that there has
been liquidation which docs not show in the
statement except to minimize the Influence of
thÂ« new business being done.

CHICAGO. Nov. 17.â Wheat was moderately
active and maintained Ita recently acquired
reputation for making a -new low price record
every day. . The pit was a little better than
hAlf occupied by discouraged bulls and confi
dent bears, whose operations drove prices a bit
deeper In the mud. December opened USSic to
a shads higher at 71 R Â«1Â«~13*c. shorts covering
moderately, because cables did not In any way
reflect the decline therein. The bulge met no
support of any magnitude and consequently the
market dropped heavily to 7O*i@70?4c. Shorts
had sold with such complete abandonment to
their belief In heavy stocks and a slack demand
I that rumors that additional mills would reopen
at Minneapolis, owing to- a better demand for
flour, sent them to cover. Under buying of this
sort December rallied sharply to 71Â»gc. There
was plenty of the cereal for Bale on the ad
vance, and a reaction followed, December clos
ing weak, Me under yesterday, at 71Â©714c
Corn was quiet and steady. . Offerings were
liberal at the start, but. were .well taken by
local bulls and later the supply and demand
was nicely balanced In the pit. December
closed unchanged at 35V4sg35%c.
The market for oats was firm. December
closed %c higher at 21%<S22c.
Provisions were again easier, .with the earns
exception In favor of November ribs which wu
noticeable yesterday. The price for this commo
dity at the close was $7 62%, 42Â»,4c over the pre
vious close. Futures were depressed by a lib
eral run of hogs and a -drop in prices at the

verely. Miss Wilton sayB she- interfered
to protect her and Sanderson turned and
struck her. She blew a police whistle, but
no one answered. Mrs. Sanderson came
to her room and she advised her tb keep
away from her husband, as he might kill
her. Mrs. Sanderson did so, and when
Sanderson met his Vlfe yesterday morn-
Ing he at once commenced to beat her.
"I heard her screams," said Miss Wil
ton, "and when I opened my door the
poor woman fell In front of It. I de
nounced him for his brutality and he
struck me. I had the scissors in my hand
and struck at him. He struck me again
and I again Jabbed him with the scissors.
I acted purely in self-defense. Oh, If I
only had him here all by ourselves Just
for a few minutes!" she cried, with a
look In her eyes that boded 111 for San
derson if she could have her wish.

atior.. to prevent the further practice of

TO HAVE LOWER
CLASSIFICATION
Plan Favored by President
Mark of the Board of
Education.
?
Funds Will Not Permit of Its Imme
diate Introduction â .TÂ»/>v'<7m n-n^
Park Schools Are Over
crowded.
President Mark of the Board of Educa
tion stated yesterday that the classifica
tion in the School Department will be re
duced to thirty or thirty-five pupils in
each class at no very distant day. This
statement is Interesting in view of the
fact that the board has all along favored
a much higher classification, which has
been strenuously but ineffectually opposed
by Superintendent of Schools Webster.
While Mark has never agreed with Den
man, who favors a classification of sixty
pupils to a class, he has, however, voted
vith his colleajruc in keeping the classifi
cation up to a high figure.
Mark says that it is not possible to in
augurate a low classification at the pres
â¢ :â¢. time owing to the lack of funds, as
It -would mean the employment of many
additional teachers.
"I agree heartily with Superintendent
Webster in his policy of lower classifica
tion." said Mark, "but he does not take
into consideration the financial condition,
of the department. A low classification ia
impossible with low funds, but we. hopÂ©
in time to be able to introduce it. I have
always disagreed with my colleagues on
the board on the subject of classification.
Our rules demand too largÂ« a class. The
t.train on the teacher !s too great and the
results cannot be as satisfactory as with j
a smaller number of pupils. The variety j
of subjects a teacher is obliged to handle
at the present day is such that it is im
possible to do justice where the number
of pupils is too large."
Regarding- the establishment of un
graded classes. Mr. Mark stated that the
innovation would probably not be made
Â¦until the end of the present fiscal year.
This will call for the appointment of a
number of extra teachers, but th* board
hopes to have more funds at Its disposal
Â¦when the new term commences. â¢
Deputy Superintendent Howard report
ed to Superintendent Webster yesterday
i hat he had visited the Park and Jackson
iichools and found them to be in a con
gested condition. This arises not so much
from the high classification which obtains
;n the department as from the fact that
.Â»ach clafs contains Wo or more mixed
jfrades. thus milking it difficult for the
â¢jeachers to do Justice to all pupils. The
appointment of an additional teacher in
â¢tach of th<Â» schools will be recommended
Ipy Superintendent "Webster in his next re
port.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1900.
Supervisors Favor Asphalt
Pavement on Concrete
Foundation.
The Supervisors' Street Committee at a
special meeting held yesterday recom-
mended that Clay, Washington, Sacra
mento and Pine streets, between Mont
gomery and Sansome, be paved with as
phalt on a six-Inch concrete foundation,
the Board of Public Works to prepare
the plans and specifications for the work.
This action is a rebuke to the last-men
tioned board, the recommendation of
which that the streets be paved with bi
tuminous rock on a cobblestone founda
tion met with severe opposition at the
last meeting of the Supervisors.
Besides the members of the Street
Committee, Supervisors Curtis. Connor
and Dwyer, there were present at the
meeting Mayor Phelan, Commissioners
Manson and Maguire of the Board of
Public Works and Citv Engineer Grun
sky. F. W. E>ohrmann, president of the
Merchants' Association; A. S. Baldwin,
president of the Grant Avenue Improve
ment Club, and Edgar Painter, secretary
of the North Central Improvement Club,
strongly urged upon the committee the
necessity of | constructing the best kind
of pavement in the downtown districts
and to remove the unsightly . cobble
stones that disfigure certain sections of
the city. A long discussion followed on
what constituted the best form of pave
ment to be used on the streets. - Manson
explained that in recommending bitumi
nous rock on a basalt base his board had
considered the cost and durability. The
difference in cost between that pavement
and bitumen laid on a concrete base was
$3500 in favor of the former and it is
guaranteed for ten years.
A. S. Baldwin and General "Warfleld ex
pressed themselves aa being in favor of
laying a pavement with cobblestone base
on Grant avenue and referred to. the
pavement In front of the Masonic Tena
ble, which consists of bitumen and cob
blestones and is as good to-day as when
first laid.
"We have been for five years," said Mr.
Dohrmann. "endeavoring to secure speci
fications for street work which will not
exclude all forms of pavement save bitu
men. I believe the pavement proposed by
the Board of Public Works Is superior
to any pavement that has been laid irj
this city for many years, and I think the
guarantee of ten years' maintenance suffi
ciently protects property-owners."
Albert Meyer made a plea for noiseless
pavement on Pine street, where the
buildings are used for offices. Edgar
Painter stated that the property-owners
on Washington street between Montgom
ery and Sansome have signed contracts
to pay one-half of the expense of bltu
mlnlzlng the street.
The committee also reported In favor of
the adoption of: a plan by the Board 10C
Public Works, whereby all the streets
ih .the business district west of Sansome
street shall hereafter be paved with bitu
men or asphalt and all the streets east
