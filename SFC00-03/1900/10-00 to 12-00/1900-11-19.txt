with friends.
The service besan with a song, "Still,
Still With Thee," by a double quartet of
men, most of them members of the Mystic
Shrine and California Commandery quar
tets, under the leadership of Samuel D.
Mayer. H. P. Umbren, worshipful master
of California Lodge, presided. The im

Miss Grace Davis sang a solo, "Angels,

The Scottish Rite Masons took charge
of the service to conduct the Rose Croix
ceremojiy. Frank Koenlg, thirty-third de
gree, master of San Francisco Consistory
and past wise master" of the Hose Croix
Chapter, was in charge, and members of
the various bodies of the Scottish Rite
alone participated.
Reuben H. Lloyd, grand master of the
Knights Templar, delivered the funeial
oration. He spoke with deÂ°p feeling and
a simple eloquence. He said in part:
"When the successful man lies down to
sleep the sleep that knows no waking and
we turn back to review his career, how
many there are whom he has surpassed,
how many whose successes have been cast
into the shadow by his achievements.
When -you look into the consciousnesses
more joy in changing a tear to a smile
than in â¢ putting a tear in the eye. He
found that In this order there was not one
selfish impulse. He found that its mission
was to feed the hungry, to clothe the
naked, to bind up the hurts of the wound
ed, to place the lamp of intelligence in
every man's hand to guide him on his
path.
' "He joined the order fifty years ago. It
did not take long 1 for his worth and ad
ministrative ability to be dlscoverd, and
he wns given office. Soon he turned from
the practice of law -and gave his whole
tirne.to efforts, for the advancement of
'niariMitflt*"""* --
"Step by step he was advanced, until
finally he was made sovereign grand com
mander of the Supreme Council of the
Scottish Rite of the Southern Jurisdiction
of the United States. A mansion in Wash
ington was his by virtue of his office.
There he would be surrounded by friends
and devotees, with the archives of the
order at hand end all of the luxuries of
life under the conditions and circum
stances of his high office. But fifty years
of his life had been spent in this State.
He had seen San Francisco grow from a
village to a metropolis. Everywhere here
he met friends of a lifetime. What won
der that these tendrils wrapped around
his heart and drew him back to Califor
nia. But duty called him to Washington
and we were soon to lose him when the
Supreme Being called him to a home
above. â¢
"Time will only add to the brilliancy of
his fame. As for us, we can only inscribe
on his tomb, 'He lived alone to do good
to his fellow-men." "
The double quartet sang "Good-Night, I
Am Going Home," concluding the ser
vices. The parade formed again and ac
companied the body .from the church out

vengeance.
"My remarks to-day are addressed not
so much to the fact that death has been
Inflicted as to the manner in which it is
done. I do not by this mean to justify
lynch law. Xo well regulated citizen ciui

But every State has these affairs and we
are not an exception."
The Governor then disclaimed any re
sponsibility for the affair, saying that he
understood that Sheriff Freeman had
agreed to leave Porter in jail for eight
days and had gone out of town so believ
ing, only to return to meet the announce
ment that the Sheriff and his prisoner
were on the way to Limon.
"This awful offense has been committed
by an entire county." he continued.
"There is no way of reaching these peo
ple. As Lord Chatham said once, "You
cannot Indict an entire nation.' In Lon
coln County these offenders would have
to sit on the Juries, indict themselves,
pass on the Indictments, convict them
selves and then the chief offender of all,
the Sheriff of the county, would have to
conduct them to the penitentiary. So all
we can do Is to declare that we as citi
zens of the same State deplore and*con
demn this act of barbarity."
LIMON, Colo., Nov. 18.â After being
notified that some fragments of bones of
a human being had been found on the
prairie near this town, Coroner Brown
and a Jury summoned by him gathered up
tne scarcely visible "remains" of John
Porter, the negro who was burned to
death on Friday night, and buried them
in a small box at the scene of the lyncn

effect that the remains were those of
John Porter, and that "the death was at
the hands of. parties unknown."

THIEVING BANK OFFICIAL
IS BETRAYED BY A WOMAN
of money in his possession.
It is learned that Brown was suspend
ed last Tuesday, pending an investigation
and that experts have been at work all
the past week. Last Friday the officers
and directors published in the papers of
this city a statement that the bank had
been found to be all right and that the
rumors about Brown were false. Thejr
continued making these statements to the
press as late as last midnight, but the
statements were not accepted by the
Commercial Tribune, which exposed the
alleged shortage and caused a panic In.
Newport to-day so that the bank had
to' be taken in charge by the examiner.
The wildest scenes resulted and serious
trouble is feared to-morrow, when the
officers and directors will be confronted
by the people.
Brown, who Is a widower, visited
Yellowstone Park last summer and
a certain Cincinnati woman wanted to
accompany him, but this Was denied her.
When she ascertained some time after
that another woman was with Brown on
his Western trip, the Cincinnati woman
gave the bank officials information that
brought about a crisis. The only fare
well letter that Brown is known to have
left was to this woman, whose apart
ments are on Ninth street In Cincinnati,
and in this letter he admits that he had
secured about all that he could get and
that the time had come to say farewelL
Brown was a great poker player, with

CINCINNATI, Ohio, Nov. 18.â United
States Bank Examiner " Tucker to
' day took possession of the German
National Bank at Newport, Ky., and .post-
ed a notice that the bank would remain
closed pending an examination. He also
announced unofficially that Frank M.
Brown, the assistant cashier, was miss-
Ing and that a partial investigation show
ed that he was short about $301,000.
Brown, who Is the son of Paris C. Brown.
ex-Mayor of Newport, and one of the
leading business men of Cincinnati, has
been with the bank for eighteen years and
was one of its most trusted men. Ex
perts state that his operations extend
over a period of ten years. He left on
a vacation last Wednesday and is sup
posed to be out of the country.. It is
generally believed that he has taken with
him a considerable sum of money.
Brown, It Is alleged, has lived a fast
llfe.with wine, women and gambling in his
repertoire. His career was cut short by
a Jealous woman, who made his doings
known to the bank's officials. Brown's
alleged shortage bad been rumored for
some time, but the bank officials and di
rectors have repeatedly declared that his
accounts were correct and that every
thing was all right.
The wildest scenes were witnessed in
Newport to-day when Examiner Tucker's
announcement was made public and se

MANILA. Nov. IS.â Last week witnessed
a very considerable increase in rebel and
American activity In the field. Many skir
mishes occurred and several small en
gagements in Northern and Southern Lu
zon. The termination o* the rains permits
a resumption of operations on both slde3.
The Americans are making a series of
aggressive movements against the insur
gents, notably on the island of Samar,
against General Lukban, whose force.i
hold the entire island with the excep
tion of three coast towns, each of which
la garrisoned by two companies of tha
Twenty-ninth Infantry and a platoon of
artillery.
The rebels are continually shooting into
the garrisoned towns, and oar forces have
not been sufficient to retaliate effectively.
Commerce in Samar has been at a stand
still and most of the Influential inhabit
ants have departed. General Hare has
arrived there with 230 men. HÂ© will bring
eight companies of the Second Infantry
from the island of Marinduque. and will
proceed energetically to crush Genera!
Lukban. Meanwhile. United States gun
boats will patrol the coast to prevent the
escape of the insurgent leader. Lukban
still holds three members of the Forty
third Regiment as prisoners.
The rifles which the party of Captain IX
Shields of Company F, Twenty-ninth Vol
unteer Infantry, lost last September In
Marinduque at the time of the capture
have not yet been returned from, the In
surgents.
Notable among the week's engagements
was General Grant's advance with Mac
cabebe and American scouts on a rebel
stronghold, thirty-five miles north of Ma
nila, which was defended by 200 insur
gents armed with rifles. After skirmish
ing and fighting for the greater part of
a day and night, the enemy was dla
lodged. and immense quantities of rice
and stores Â¦ with ammunition were de
stroyed. Fifty Filipinos were killed and
many others wounded. The Insurgents
carried off , their dead. The American
losses were eleven privates and one offl

A German firm of publishers a little
while ago hit upon a novel and ingenious
method of advertising, which has been
attended by the happiest results. They
caused to be inserted in most of the news
papers a notice to the effect that a cer
tain nobleman of wealth and high posi
tion, desiring' a wife, wanted one who re
sembled the heroine in tho novel named.
Thereupon every marriageable woman
who saw the notice bought the book to
see what the heroine was like, and the
work had an Immense sale. But It Is said
that the publishers had to engage the ser
vices of. several additional clerks to deal
with the deluge of feminine correspond
ence from the numberless women who
claimed to be the "image" of the heroine.

KANSAS CITT, Nov. 18.â A special to
the Times from Poplar Bluff, Mo., says:
Walter Alexander, the 15-year-old son of
Richard Alexander, a farmer living across
the line In Arkansas, is under arrest on
suspicion of being implicated in the death
of his father, who was shot and killed yes
terday. Young Alexander, who was ar
rested pending 1 an investigation, is. said to
have confessed the crime and to have im
plicated his mother, slater and the latter's
husband, James Hogan, all of whom have
been arrested and placed in jail at Corn

Hogan, whom they profess to believe Is
at the bottom of the affair, â¢will be taken
to the County Jail at Paragould, Ark., for
safe keeping.
Alexander was killed with a shotgun, re
ceiving the contents of both barrels in the
breast and stomach and dying almost Im
mediately. His family Informed the of
ficers, who had previously been notified of
the affair, that he had accidentally shot
himself while loading the gun. The na

neighbors that the family had quarreled
frequently with the dead man led to the
detention of the son. Young Alexander,
It is stated, admitted in his confession
that the killing had been planned delib

"The last section, however, authorizes
the United States to maintain such mili
tary police along the canal as may be
necessary to protect it against lawlessness
and disorder, and under this provision we
can. If we so desire, send an. army corps
to guard the waterway."
Opposition to the treaty 13 based on the
fact that it provides that no fortifications
shall be erected on the, canal. The Hep
burn bill, which has passed the House,
provides for the construction and protec
tion by the Secretary of War of a Nlca
raguan canal. In addition Senator Davis
has brought before the Senate Committee
on Foreign Relations an amendment to
the effect that nothing in the treaty shall
restrict the measures which the United
States may find necessary for the defense
of the United States. Efforts will be made
to kill the Davis amendment. Grave
doubts are expressed as to whether it
would be accepted by Great Britain. The
amendment has excited ridicule. It was
copied. from the tenth clause of the Con
stantinople treaty securing the neutrality
of the Suez canal. On this point one of
the best informed friends of the Hay-
Pauncefote treaty said to-day:
"The Suez convention provides thai
Turkey shall not be prevented from ex
pressing any sovereign rights necessary
for her own seU-defense, Instead of pur
suing the analogy of the case and giving
to Nicaragua the power to do anything
necessary for her national defense, the
Senate committee placed in the Paunce
fote treaty an amendment by which the
United States ftgrees with England that
the United SUtes, and not Nicaragua,
shall do anything that may be necessary.
"The committee left out of view the first
section of article 2 of the treaty, provid
ing that the Nicaragua canal shall be free
and open in time of war as in time of
peace, and the seventh section of the same
article, which especially forbids the erec
tion of fortifications.
This action bids fair to precipitate a
memorable co'ntest at the coming session
of Congress, and circumstances make it
necessary that President McKinley and
Secretary Hay shall bring to bear all the
Influences at their command..

"There are three wholly distinct sides
to the ice trust matter. In the first place,
there is the general question whether the
American Ice Company, dealing as It does
in a necessity of life to the poor people
of New York, was one into v/hich it was
proper for a public spirited .man to enter.
This is, of course, not a question for legal
action In any shape or form. Moreover,
it Is unnecessary to point out that wheth
er the corporation is legal or illegal, prop
er or improper in character, it is an act of
utter hypocrisy on the part of any public
NEW YORK, Nov. 18.â Governor
Roosevelt has" prepared the fol
lowing memorandum of the
charges against Mayor Van
Wyck of Greater New York in
the ice trust matter:
When the subject of tax reduction was
first agitated at the last session of . Con
gress it was assumed that the expendi
tures of the Government would be con
siderably reduced after the present fiscal
vear. There is now no prospect of such
a reduction. Estimates for the next fiscal
year will contemplate expenditures con
siderably in excess of those for the cur
rent year. Appropriations for the current
year aggregate $709,729,476. For the fiscal
year estimates will amount to $750,000,000
or more. Including the expense of tho
postal service, which is almost entirely
paid for by the receipts from postal reve
nues. The principal reason for this in
crease instead of a possible reduction is
that tho continuation of the war in the
Philippines has made It Impossible to re
duce the jexpenditures for a military
establishment. Estimates for this object
will be approximately what they were last
year In round figuresâ $128,000,000.
An extensive ship-building programme
being carried out by the navy also re
quires increased expenditures, and naval
estimates for next year are more than.
$28,700,000 larger than' for tho last year.
An estimate will also be submitted for
about $25,000,000 for river and harbor im
provements. Tho only material reduction
will be one of about $7,000,000 estimated
for the expenses of taking the census, the
most expensive work of the bureau hav
ing been finished.
During the last fiscal year the revenues
exceeded the expenditures by $79,527,060.
This year the surplus to date Is only $7,
460,601. These figures make it evident
that with the prospect that expenditures
for the next year will Increase it will be
impossible to make much of a cut in the
revenues.
The repeal of tho proprietary stamp tax
will reduce the revenues about $5,CO0,000 a
year. It is impossible to make such close
estimates as to the amount that will be
cut off by the repeal of other taxes. Doc
umentary stamps are used indiscriminate
ly on all documents requiring the pay
ment of taxes, and the Commissioner is
unable to tell closely how much revenue
is derived from any one kind of taxed
paper. It is roughly estimated, how
ever, that the totat reduction by the pro
posed repeals will be about $15,000,000.
Strong efforts will bu made to have the
beer tax reduced, but it is not bellved the
condition of the treasury will admit of
such a reduction. The repeal of other
documentary taxes will also be urged, but
some of these, especially the taxes on
stock exchange transactions, are now
looked upon as permanent, and will not
be disturbed.
The Commissioner will submit a report
to Secretary Gage to-morrow showing as
nearly as possible how much revenue will
be cut off by this means.
CALL BUREAU, WELLINGTON HO
TEL, WASHINGTON, Nov. 18.â Secretary
of tho Treasury Gage will probably rec
ommend a reduction of not more than
115,000,000 a year In war revenue taxes.
"Estimates are now being made," said
Commissioner of Internal Revenue Wil
son to-day, "on a basis of the repeal of
all proprietary stamp taxes and the repeal
of documentary stamp taxes on notes,

fidence that h<Â» v.-;il recover. A Foreign
Office offlcia! toM a correspondent iast
eveni^K that th<Â» bulletins were regrarded
as favorable. He called attention to the
distinction between typhus in the Ameri
can sens* of the word and typhus as un
derstood in Russia, where the term corre
sponds with typhoid in American termin
ology. The typhoid is common, the of
ficial pointed out. in all Russian cities
owing- to the deficient hyslcnic conditions,
but it is not feared in this country as ii.
the United States.
"Moreover," continual the official, "the
CzfLr'e general health is pood. Persons
who have pocn him at close quarters dur
ing- the past few months give no credence
to the stori< s of his alleged feebleness.
They have not observed the slightest con
dition of linpering injury from the saber
Mow he received in Japan. They utterly
â¢iisbclleve the assertion often made abroad
Ihr.t *hÂ« Czar is an epileptic."
Considerable surprise is expressed that
his Majesty should have contracted a dis
ease attributed to tainted nourishment.
. It arrears, however, that he is imprudent
in his diet, does not always follow medi
cal direction and often drinks any water
he can cet wh-^n walking or dri\in?r. The
possibility of h'.s having contracted dis
ease from milk is also being considered.
The news nf thÂ«* Czar's illness is gradu
ally reaching the general populace, and
many sympathetic references to his condi
tion are heard among the people of St.
Petersburg, who are apparently greatly
attached to the person of the monarch.
Fpecial prayers for his recovery were of
fered to-day in the churches of St. Peters
burg, Moscow and Kharkow.
A special from Ovadia. European Rup

His temperature at 9 p. m. was 101.6 and

Killing of the Countess.

LEAVENWORTII, Kans., Nov. 18.â The
escaped convicts, Cravens and Estell, were
to-day surrounded in the hills a mile from
Brighton, having, escaped from the barn
burned by the posse.
The pla.ee is rough and well adapted to
screen the convicts, and, as they are well
armed, the posse will probably starve
them out. and not try to force surrender.
The officers are sure that one of the men
is bnrlly wounded aa a result of the first
day's fusillade.
DENVER. Nov. 18.âAfter nearly two
months' confinement In Jail here Joseph
Haennalt has Just confessed that he was
implicated In the robbery of Mrs. Flora
Betts on the night of August 27. when
diamonds valued at $7000 were taken from
her after she had been beaten almost Into
insensibility. i
At the time of the robbery Haennalt and
Mrs. Betts were returning from a drive
into the country. They were held up by
two men. one of whom murderously as
saulted Mrs. Betts. Haennalt was also
robbed of $40! He was arrested on the fol
lowing day, and has been held ever since.
In his confession he charges John Barr,
who operates a vinegar factory on the
south Bide, with being the chief actor,
although he acknowledges that he planned
the robbery and induced Mrs. Betts to go
with him for a drive that his accomplices
might secure the Jewels which she was In
the habit of wearing. ; - ..;
Barr's refusal to visit Haennalt in jail
or to return the $40, It is said, caused him
to make the confession. Barr was ar
rested some time ago, but was released
on baiL He was rearrested. Dan Con
way, a dairyman, has been arrested as
an accessory. .

The valley has never been In better con
dition than it is at the present time. After
the first rains the falls are booming. A.
H. "U'ashburn, superintendent of the Yo
semite Stage and Turnpike Company, said
to-day:
"I have been In the valley every year
for the last forty years, and I think it is
a mistaken idea that during the months
of May and June is the time to visit Yo
semite. In the spring the weather is al
ways unsettled. and many points of inter
est are Inaccessible on account of the
snow, but In the fall every one Is accessi
ble and the autumn tints and sunsets add
greatly to the trip. I think It is folly, this
talk of building a road into Yosemite for
winter travel when the fall travel is so
light. During the winter the falls are al
ways low, as their supply of water de
pends upon the melted snow in the higher
regions surrounding the valley, and the
valley is not to be compared to what it is
in the fall."

The rrrsent outbreak of hostilities is due
to an alleged improvement introduced by
Golf Instructor Smith, a recent importa
tion frcm the land of haggis. In order to
afford easy passage from one putting
preen to another, little turnstiles have
been erected on the barbed-wire fences
which encompassed the links. The move
was in the direction of retrenchment and
reform, for in the old days the dam
ap<> to Tartan inexpressibles and scarlet
Jackets occasioned by climbing over the
thorny fence after stray balls was dis
tressful to contemplate. Then, too, there
w*>re the ladies.
But Secretary Brown. Instructor Smith
and the committee never stopped to con
template the effect of the innovation on
Mr. Stetson's kine. Lured by the puff
balls and cooling greenery of the teeing
(TTounds, a sociable old dowager Aldcrney,
which had never before been known to
stray from the paths of Stetsonian recti
tude, ambled through a convenient turn
stile, and a bevy of kittenish heifers fol
lowed her. It got so. finally, that Fred
Green couldn't make a drive without
plugging on<Â» of Stetson's prize cattle,
and when two promising yearlings be
came mired in the club's water bunker
snd a lady player -was treed near hole 4
by a fierce moo-cow, the committee called
a halt.
Lawyer Stetson was equal to the emer
gency. After several days' labor he shov
eled from th* 1 dusty records of the city
of San Rafael an old town ordinance
which provides that all fences must be
cattle-proof, and he threatens an action
for damaccs against the club. He also
hints darkly that the caddies enticed his
tTwiri* 1 prize Â¦winner? Into the water
bunker?, and then, taking an unfair ad
vantage r>f them, milked them.
"You can granulate me in a box
churn if I'll surp'y milk for eighteen
t*>*>s." he remarked.
Th* club proposes to charge storage on
ell mire<l cattle and pasturage for those
that hrnwsM on the putting greens. The
rates will be fixed by a special commit
tee.
PAN RAFAEL. Nov. IS.â The war be
tween Edward Gray Stetson, the owner
cf the Toyon ranch, and the San Rafael
Qolt Club, has broken out anew, and
spectral injunctions and other horrid le
graJ bugaboos gibber at the door of the

a lawyer, with a hobby for breeding blue

he and the gobiacp are neighbors. In the

Stetson averred that the caddies were
far too fend of chicken dinners, and that
his Legrhorns and Plymouth Rocks that
wardered away from the shadow of his
henhouse to the putting green got sty

VALfLEJO, Nov. 18.â Naval Construct
or Frank B. Zahm, U. S. N., who as
sumed chai-ge of , the construction
and repair department of the Mare
Island Navy Yard on Monday last, entered
the Naval Academy at Annapolis from
Pennsylvania In 1887. After graduation he
made a cruise with the white squadron
and afterward In the West Indies and
South America. He took a special course
of study at the University of Glasgow,
Scotland, since which time he has been
on difty at the Norfolk and New York
navy yards, and latterly, since 1897, has
been attached to the bureau of construc
tion and repair with the exception of
about six months during the Spanish war,
when he had charge of the naval station
at Port Royal, S. C.
The Army and Navy Register of recent
date has this to say of Constructor Zahm:
"There Is genuine regret over the detach
ment from duty In Washington of Frank
B. Zahm, IJ. S. N. He has been since
September. 1897, prominently and intimate
ly identified with the affairs of the bureau
of construction and repair, and has gained
the respect and friendship of those who
have had business relations with that of
fice. Chief Constructor Hichborn has
been fortunate in his possession as an as
sistant of Naval Constructor Zahm, whose
uniform courtesy to those who had occa
sion to visit the bureau. has been quite as
appreciable as is his marked ability as a
member of a valuable corps and an ad
viser of its head. His departure from
Washington will therefore be the occasion
of regret to many others than his office
associates.. No officer has taken from
"Washington to his new duty a . greater
measure of good wishes .than accompanies
Mr. Zahm, who leaves to-day for Mare
Island."
On assuming charge of the construction
department last Monday , his first move
was to call- all of the foremen . together.
In a very pleasant and agreeable manner
he told them that they had the reputation
of being the best foremen as a class in the
navy, and he earnestly -desired, their

Mitchell Bunker, who has achieved the
distinction of being the first foreign wo
man to cross Siberia from east to west,
arrived in this city to-day by the Umbria
on the last portion of a two years* trip
around the world. -When she and her hus
band started on their journey, they wero
advised by Russian officials that it would
not be safe for a woman to venture, with
out a strong escort, through the Czar's
Asiatic dominions, but Mrs. Bunker was
not to be deterred by the perils and dis
comforts of a long trip.
From San Francisco, which they left
in March of 1899. Mr. and Mrs. Bunker
went direct to Yokohama and then ovc
to Russian Asia, landing at Vladivostok.
Mrs. Bunker says that she soon found
that traveling In Russia- meant very te
dious delays and mucn looking after ono'3
self. Beyond this she says she found it
a delightful experience.
Mrs. Bunker said: "The'' entire trip
from Vladivostok to Moscow ' occupied
nearly sixty days, as we left Vladivostok
May 30 and reached Moscow July 2S, but
fully thirty days of this time was wasted
in waiting for steamboats and railway
trains. The actual time spent in travel
ing was about, thirty days. The entire
distance traveled- is about 6500 miles. â¢
"We carried our own food throughout
fhe trip, for the Inns are atrocious and ill
smelling, and we lived on canned goods
and prepared all our meals. The Rus
sians themselves were unfailingly kind
and we did not have Ihe slightest trouble
with officials from ' Vladivostok to St.
Petersburg." Â« : - ' ' ,
Mr. Bunker, who went .through Siberia
at the reauest- of the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce to ascertain what
effects the opening of Eastern Asia would
have Â¦ upon the Pacific Coast of America,
said he found that the development of
Siberia means only new and greater mar
kets - for, the Western States. - He found
flour from Oregon, and California lining
the banks of the Amur at every steamer
landing and boatloads of American lum
ber at different ports on the river.

FIRST FOREIGN WOMAN"
TO CROSS SIBERIA
NEW YORK, Nov. 18.â Francis D.
Carley, a well known Wall street broke-,
who lives at Orange, N. J., made an
nouncement to-day at Newark that lato
on Saturday he had filed in the United
States District Court at Trenton a peti
tion in bankruptcy. The petition de
clares the liabilities to be more than a
million and the assets nothing.
A list of the principal creditors is: Mrs.
C. D. Carley, borrowed money, $500,575;
Inman, Swan & Co., New York, judg
ment, $235,000; J. Kennedy Tod & Co..
New York, judgment. $180,000: Franz
Deutsch and Caesar Schlessinger. Lon
don, Judgment, $30,000; Van Schack & Co..
Isew York, balance on contract, $60,000;
n.. M. Boack, New York, $30,000; Clay
City National Bank, Judgment, indorse
ment notes of Kentucky Union Railway
Co.. $8000; German Security Bank, Louis
ville, Ky., guarantee in the Kentucky
Union Railway Co., $7000; Kentucky Na
tional Bank, Louisville, guarantee note,
Kentucky Union Railway Co., $16,000.
In addition there are about a score of
other creditors holding claims amounting
to from $50 to $3000.
These claims, Mr. Carley says, are the
result of a venture in the South several
years ago in which he lost $1,500,000.
While Mr. Carley was abroad recently
one of his clerks acquainted some of thÂ£
judgment creditors with the fact that
about $200,000 had been placed with cer
tain brokers for investment. Believing
that to be Mr. Carley's money the cred
itors began to force payment of judg
ments, placing attachments on tno
money, and as a result he concluded to
take advantage of the bankruptcy laws
in the interest of all his creditors.
Mr. Carley, who is 61 years of age, is
an Ohioan by birth. He moved from Chi
cago to Louisville In 1865. Here his
career as a financier began when he be
came- affiliated with the Standard Oil
Company as president of Its Southern
branch.
In 1890 Mr. Carley came to New York
and at once took a prominent place in
financial circles. He became head of the
brokerage firm of Carley, Stock & Co..
which has since become the firm, of F.
D. Carley & Co. In 1S90 Mr. Carley began
the building of the Kentucky Union Rail
road, and he dropped a fortune.
Mr. Carley, In an interview, blames cer
tain Wall street men for forcing him In
financial matters and saya he will soon
make an expose.

VANCOUVER, Nov. 18.â Elections have
already taken place in 211 of the 213 con
stituencies represented In the Canadian
House of Commons, and contest have yet
to be held in but two districts, one of
which is . Vancouver. Because of lta
tr-dlness, the election here has taken on
extraordinary Importance. Several of the
leaders of both of the political parties are
here participating In the campaign, which
Is ' growing In bitterness day by day.
Sir Charles Tupper, the octogenarian
politician who Is about to retire from the
leadership of the Conservative party,
after having suffered a general defeat In
the various provinces as well as having
been rejected for Parliament in his own
individual constituency, was the star at
traction at a large mass meeting held
last nlffnt In the Interests of Mayor Gar
den, the Conservative candidate. Sir
Charles made a violent attack upon the
Liberal leaders and Liberal methods. He
was especially virulent in his denuncia
tion of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, the French-
Canadian Premier of Canada. He declared
thÂ«-^ Sir Wilfrid had remained In office
by. appealing to the base passions of his
ignorant French-Canadian compatriots
In stentorian tones he asserted that Str
Wilfrid was setting race against race and
creed against creed in homogeneous Can
adaâthat he was sowing the seeds of a
lifetime of discord.
"He Is breeding bitterness and unhap
plness and strife," passionately declared
the aged baronet. "French-Canadians
rule Canada to-day. Men of British blood,
how much more are you going to stand?"
Sir Charles' remarks created a sensation
at the meeting, and the sensation nas been
developing ever since. The anti-French
feeling of hatred has been greatly ln
creassd, and Conservatives are loud In
their denunciation of their fellow coun
trymen of Gallic descent.
"Already," he continued, "the French
are sJl-powerful at Ottawa, and none but
a Frenchman can obtain an appointment
or secure a oontract for any public work
in or out of Quebec Even In the old Brit
ish Columbian town cf New "Westminster,
the people entirely being English or
Scotch, a French-Canadian from Quebec
was given the contract for the new Fed
eral buildings now In course of construc
tion there; every stonemason, every plas
terer and every carpenter working on that
building Is a French-Canadian, brought
9000 miles from Quebec to New Westmin
ster to do work which should be given to
home, mechanics, but the latter possess
the unpardonable offense of an English
tongue, and no favors need be expected
by them."
Sir Charles salt! that If the English
speaking' people, comprising: the greater
part of the Canadian population, should
rise up In their might agralnst the i'rench-
Canadians the Liberals alone would be to
blame.

The Spanish armored "cruiser Cataluna
was launched at Carthagena September
24. The vessel, which is practically du
plicate of the Ill-fated Colon, Oquendo,
Vlscaya and Marie Terese, is 348 feet in
length. 61 feet beam and displaces 67W
tons on 2Ui feet draught. The engines
are to develop 10.000 horsepower under
natural draught and 15,000 under forced
draught with corresponding speeds of IS
and 20 knots. The armor belt Is 230 feet
in length, 5& feet up and down and 10
inches to 12 inches in thickness; the tur
rets are of like thickness, and the arm
ored deck Is 2 to 2% inches. The arma
ment consists of two 11-inch, ten 5%-lnch,
two 14-pounders, eight 12-pounders and
four 3-ponnders. The bunker "capacity is
1200 tons.
Promotion of officers In European na

dual plan works unsatisfactorily and Is
the cause of much heartburning among

THE- JOY-GIVING RAINS.
WHILE the rains thus far have not been suffi
cient to give any assurance of good crops for
the coming season, they have been ample
enough to raise sanguine hopes and give something
of joy to every section of the State. There is no
question that- a much more cheerful spirit will
now be felt by all classes of people, and preparations
for Thanksgiving and the holiday season will be made
with a true holiday spirit.
Though the rain was welcome everywhere a partic
ular gratification will be felt over that which has come
so timely in the southern counties. To the orange
growers the storm has been a veritable blessing and
its benefits will be immediate. The long drought
that has so interfered with the prosperity of that sec
tion appears at last to have ended, and the orchardists
can now expect a return of the bountiful seasons of
the past.
Mr. McAdie, chief of the United States Weather
Bureau on this coast, reports the storm to have been
the most extensive of the last four or five years. In
a statement published yesterday he said: "It is rain
ing, from the Mexican to the Canadian
We do not often have that condition. It has rained
all through Arizona." He went on to add: "I have
no doubt that this storm is one of the greatest bene
fits in a way that has befallen this State -for 'some
time. The orange crop particularly needed the rain,
as ijt was colorine very raoidlv: and the growers were

W9RK OF THE SESSION.
SENATOR HANNA in a recent interview stated
that at the coming session the energies of Con
gress would be directed mainly to the army bill,
the shipping bill and the Nicaraguan canal bill. The
opinion is in harmony with that expressed by other
responsible Republican leaders. For example, Mr.
Payne, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee
of the House, has stated that the task of making a
thorough revision of the war tax will probably be
left to the next Congress, and that in the short session
that now remains for this Congress hardly anything
will be undertaken outside of routine bills, except the
measures named by Senator Hanna.
The work outlined is ample, .and , if it be accom
plished the public will be well satisfied. It appear?
certain that some of the defects of the war tax will
be remedied during the session, but that a complete
revision will be postponed for the good and suffi
cient reason that until it has been' determined what
expenditures the Government will undertake for the
construction of the canal, the government of the Phil
ippines and the building of new ships for the navy,
coast defenses and the promotion "of our merchant
marine, it will not be possible to determine* J-^t how
far, if any, the revenues from the present rate 01 :^vxa
tion may be diminished.
It would be gratifying if to the measures named by
Senator Hanna and Mr. Payne there could be added
this winter the. immigration restriction bill, of which
Senator Lodge recently spoke in Boston. . The tide
of immigration has been rapidly rising of late and
increases with the increasing" prosperity of the "coun
try. Moreover, it is becoming more and more an
immigration from Southeastern Europe, composed of
ignorant and moneyless people. Such, immigration
is objectionable on every .score, and if it bepossible
to anolv a check this winter it'should be done. .

/'"""* HICAGO will this morning have the honor of
I entertaining a convention called for the purpose
promoting the improvement of highways,
devising means for the accomplishment of such work
and planning a compaign of education to interest the
public in the enterprise. The convention will be in
session for three days and will be immediately fol
lowed at the same ciiy and in the same hall by the
National Irrigation Congress.
The good roads' movement has been before the
country a long time. In some of the older States a
most commendable progress has been made, while in
others little or nothing has beendone. In that respect
California has been an epitome of the whole Union,
for in some of our counties a most excellent system of
roadways has been established and is maintained, but
in others the reverse is the case. We can show sec
tions of the State in which the highways are as good
as any in the most progressive parts of the Union,
and there are other sections where the people tiave
been content with the most primitive sort of thor
oughfares.
Such being the case, our interests in the movement
for better highways is as great as that of any other
class of American people. We ought therefore to be
ready to profit by anything that may be done by the
'Chicago convention. A circular announces that a.
large attendance is anticipated and that the gathering
is expected to be the most practical industrial conven
tion ever called in this country.
Concerning the importance of the movement it is
sufficient to point out that 99 per cent of every load
by railroad, steamboat or express must be carried in
a wagon or truck over a highway. -.The statistics of
the "office of road inquiry," under the Secretary of
Agriculture at Washington, prove that it costs the
farmers of the United States nearly three times more
than those of Europe to market an equal tonnage of
farm products over primary roads.
HIGHWAY IMPROVEMENT..
FASHION HINT FROM PARIS.
TRADE ALREADY RESPONDING.
THE return of the Republican administration to
power has already produced a marked improve
ment in business throughout the country. For
the first time in months the bank clearings last week
showed a pain over the corresponding week of last
year, and even New Xork exhibited an increase. The
gain for the whole country was I4-* per cent, against
an average loss of 15 per cent fcÂ«* oonths past, anl
that for New York 21. 1 per cent All large cities ex
cept Boston and Chicago showed a gain. This is
another beneficial reversal of previous conditions, for
these very same large cities have heretofore shown au
urvarying loss. It was expected that the country would
show an improvement in business after the re-election
of President McKinley, but it was not expected to
appear so soon, nor so pronounced.
True, the weather throughout the Eastern States
has turned cold, and this has stimulated the lagging
demand for goods, especially for clothing and other
merchandise dependent upon winter weather, but no
body disputes the beneficent influence of the election.
But the weather does not affect the foreign export
trade, which is rapidly increasing and which is assum
ing large proportions. Nor does it produce the
bunching of new enterprises, of which the prelim
inary plans are now being considered. Hence it is
s?fe to say that the major part of the current business
improvement is directly traceable to the election.
Wall street was quieter last week. The intense fire
and snap of the few days immediately following the
election were no longer visible. Trading was active,
however, though the hardening of the money market
tended to restrict operations, and there was heavy
selling, principally by people who were shrewd
enough to take the profits of the post-election ad
vance. The industrials weakened first, and the rail
roads followed. Later on in the week, however, many
stocks showed a tendency to recover the lost ground,
and there was no general downward' settlement after
the first day or two. â¢
The commercial staples generally ruled firm. The
iron interests attempted to advance prices in view of
an improved demand, and did succeed in some cases,
though it was claimed that the advance checked the
demand. The call for rails and structural material,
however, continued good. Hardware was reported in
better request in sympathy with the raw material.
Hides ceased to advance, but were still quoted firm.
Cotton hardened, owing to the colder weather, and
this produced a general business improvement
throughout the Southern States.- Wheat weakened
off, owing to heavy' quantities set afloat by foreign
countries, and to the bearish effect of the usual weekly
statistics. The country's failures, like the bank clear
ings, made an improved exhibit, those for the week
being 217, against 219 for the corresponding week,
in 1899.
The feature of the week locally was the heavy rain,
which caused a feeling of confidence everywhere. In
some parts of the State the fall was unusually copious
for this time of the year. It put the ground in condi
tion for renewed plowing, and as a large area had
already been turned up and sown the prospects for a
large grain acreage this year are bright.
The internal trade of the State continues brisk and
the export mpvement largej Shipowners report great
prosperity in their line, with not enough ships to
transport all the freight offered. Many more vessels
are needed to handle the commerce of the Pacific
Coast, which is increasing with remarkable rapidity.
The political events of the world during the past three
years have turned an immense demand for goods into
Pacific Coast channels, and the coast will hencefoijja
enjoy a permanent export demand which will more
than ever make San Francisco what it has always
been called, the gateway to the Pacific. And the major
part of this unboundsd prosperity has been caused by
the administration of President McKinley.

VOTING MACHINE RETURNS.
rOR several years past public interest in the re
turns from elections in States where voting ma
chines are in use has never been satisfied until
full information has been giv.cn of the operation of the
machines. In the past the reports have been almost
uniformly favorable, and this year the uniformity has
not been broken at all, so far as we can learn. In
every place where the machines were used they have
given satisfaction.
The Utica Observer undertook to publish an even
ing edition, giving a complete report of the voting
in that city during the day, and thanks to the speed
'of the machines it succeeded in doing so. From an
account given of the enterprise by that paper it ap
pears the first full. .report from a voting district, was
received at the Observer office just eighteen minutes
after the polls closed. Reports from other districts
followed fast, and the evening edition appeared with
complete returns in detail within an hour and a half
after the closing of the polling booths.
In fact, the Observer managed to give more than
the Utica returns, for it published at the same time
reports from other cities and towns where machines
were used. Thus the account says:
"In the meantime the Observer's correspondent aj
Rome had secured the vote in that city and tele
phoned to this office. There were nine machines in
Rome, and the work there was done with accuracy
and wonderful dispatch. West Win field, which also
had a voting machine, was secured by telephone, and
at 6:30 the edition giving the returns from the two
cities was issued."
The Springfield Republican, giving an account of
machine voting at Northampton,, Mass., says: "The
general result of the Bardwell votometer is that 26ig
votes were registered, against 2459 four years ago,
and the blanks were less in almost every case. This is
a good showing, but there were, a few cases in which
individual voters lost their vote because they could
not wait their turn. The voters crowded the polls
from the very minute of the opening.' Long lines ex
tended from the machines to the railing and beyond.
Voters waited from ten to forty-five minutes. The
voting was done in from thirty seconds to four min
utes. The use of. the votomettr was fairly successful,
and would have been thoroughly so had the State law
permitted the arrangement of the names otherwise
than alphabetically, or had there been two voting
machines in each ward. The votometer .would give
entire satisfaction even under present conditions in
wards having no more than 350 voters."
The opposition to the machines from the politicians
continues, but it is to be noted the success attained
wherever they have been tried has not been without
its effect. Boston is to give the machines a trial in a
municipal election to take place in December: and
there is a strong movement to bring about their. use
in Pennsylvania. A constitutional amendment will
be required in that State to effect the change, and
the Legislature is expected at the coming session
to submit such an amendment to the people.
The tests' that are to be made in Massachusetts and
Pennsylvania will be of value to all the States. It is
certain lhat those who will conduct the experiments in
those States will not be indulgent to any faults in the
machines, for in both States there is manifest disin
clination to accept the results obtained elsewhere.
Both in Boston and Philadelphia the authorities and
the press demand a local trial before deciding. The
desirability of providing for a prompt and accurate
count of the ballots at elections is not to be denied,
and consequently the public will note with no little
interest the results that are to be obtained from tha
new tests to which the machines are to be subjected.

DID you ever see' such swell gowns
as were displayed on Monday night
at the opera? We have been told I
don't knovr just how many times
that we had no grandmothers. Now,
I could easily have disproved that on our
first Melba night just by showing yards
and yards of the rarest and oldest of rare
old lace. If we had no â¢ grandmothers
where could we get our magnificent and
yellowed meshes? And if we had no Oak
land i millionaires how could .we fill our
family circle during an opera season?
On Monday night I saw the house, and,
of course, listened to the- music from a
"palco." â¢ Inspired by the rare art of the
singers. I gazed heavenward, and thenâ
oh, good fortuneâ I saw all my Oakland
friends in the family circle. There were
the McNcars and the Goodalls and heaps
of others. And not forretting my San
Francisco frionds. I must mention the
Schmiedells and t^e Dunhams.
Some people will tell you that where you
find wealth there also will you find a
lacking of all things artistic: That als->
the opera gives me a chance to disprove.
Any artist will explain to you that the
true music lover is to be found in '.he .am
ily circle, and if you care I can mention
at least ten milionalres who took their
opera at that altitude.

afraid that there might be some injurious results from
the long dry season. In the northern valleys, San
Joaquin and Salinas particularly, the rainfall has been
exceedingly* heavy! It gives the farmers a supply of
water that will carry them for quite a while, and,
what is of more consequence, it restores the confi
dence of the farmerin the rain conditions of this State."
It is to be noted that not only was there an abun
dant rainfall in the valleys and along the Joothills, but
that snow fell in the mountains. That means a large
amount of stored waters to descend to the valleys in
streams later on. The great reservoirs of the irriga
tion districts will be well filled and the natural reser
voirs of the upper mountains will also be supplied
with water to furnish the springs that feed the rivers.
It is of course far too early to begin to "count chick
ens," but none the less the condition now prevailing
is undoubtedly full of promise. It would be impos
sible to calculate accurately the extent to which the
advancement of California was retarded by the defi
cient rainfall for several winters following immedi
ately after the great industrial depression that began
in 1893. The panic years and the dry years taken to
gether placed a heavy handicap upon the State for
seven successive years. We are now seemingly about
to begin an era of greater prosperity than ever before,
with all forces of nature and of commerce working
harmoniously to v promote our interests. Good rains
and good business with rising prices and increasing
industrial activity taken together are sure to bring
large rewards to the diligent and the thrifty. What
the. future will bring no man can forecast, but *t
present California has every reason for making ready
for a joyous Thanksgiving.
SHOULD California receive an abundant rainfall
this winter the lact should not inariyway remove
from the public mind the impressions produced
by the lessons of the dry years. Whether we have
rainy winters or. dry winters, it is equally a matter
of importance for us to devise a comprehensive sys
tem of water storage. The campaign of education
upon the issue of conserving our forests and our flood
waters should go on wibh unwavering vigor, and as
speedily as possible we should begin the work of con
servation.
At the present time we are permitting our forests
to burn and our waters to run away in floods, with
the negligence of utter barbarians. The people of old
Egypt 4000 years ago were wiser than we. The old
Peruvian Incas were wiser. The losses we suffer in
that way even in the best years are incalculable; and
what is worse the loss increases with the years, so
that what is felt as a slight evil at present impends
with a menace of ruin over the future.
Something of the extent of the injury done has
been exhibited in an address at Sacramento by the
Hon. William E. Smythe, vice president of the Cali
fornia Water and Forest Association. Comparing ths
progress made in Sacramento Valley, where little or
nothing has been done in the way of irrigation with
what has been attained in the south, he quoted statis
tics of the census just taken, and said:
"The Sacramento Valley gained as a whole a beg
garly 4 per cent on the figures of 1890, which is less
than the normal natural increase. Even that littls
gain was mostly credited to towns and cities. Four
of your ten counties showed an actual decrease; four
others gained less than a thousand each. And yet
in this imperial valley all the people of New York
and New England might find homes and ready sus
tenance from your resources! The seven counties of
the south gained 47 per cent in the same period, or
nearly five times as much. . If we leave out Sant 1
Barbara, Ventura and San Diego, and consider only
the reasonably well irrigated counties of 'Los Angeles,
Orange. San Bernardino and Riverside, we find that
the gain in the south was 67 per cent, against 4 per
cent in the Sacramento Valley."
Mr. Smythe went on to point out that we have
undertaken irrigation in an inadequate way; and as
an illustration he said: "In 1857 we enacted the dis
trict irrigation laws. We created nearly fifty districts,
which issued about $17,000,000 of bonds and disposed
o: about $10,000,000 of them. With the single execp
tion of Turlock all those districts are financial wrecks.
To landowners they have brought nothing but dis
appointment and 'hope deferred that niaketh th^
heart sick.' "
We must have a better as well as a more compre
hensive system of dealing with the problem and a
model upon which to base future action is to be found
in the plans devised by Napoleon for the redemption
of the plains of Lombardy. Under the Napoleonic
law no irrigation district could be formed "until the
expert engineers of the Government had reported that
it was feasible, that the water was available and that
the works proposed would furnish adequate protec
tion for life and property. Neither could a district is
sue bonds until the financial experts had examined the
project and calculated the relation of debt to security,
of earning capacity to fixed charges."
We need some such law as that, but the particular
form of law is a matter .of detail. The important point
is to devise and put in force a thorough system of
preserving our forests and conserving the flood wate r s
of the State. Were anything like an adequate system
of flood storage provided we would never need fear a
dry season. There is no lack of water on this side the
Sierras if we were only wise enough to make use of it.

A Call reporter visited a number of the
leading bakeries late yesterday, and the
managers of the respective houses said
that the movement was satisfactory to
them. A few families had forgotten on
Saturday to take in an extra supply of
bread, but the family trade would soon
become accustomed to the new rule, the
master bakers said. The hotel and res
taurant part of tho business did not meet
with any Inconvenience, as they were sup
plied with bread late on Saturday night.
All the good 1 housewives in the future
will have to remember that now the baker
has a chance the same as other people to
attend church on a Sunday and eat at
least one dinner a week at home, and that
by ordering enough bread on Saturday to
keep the family supplied until Monday
mornlng*s breakfast they are helping a
great number of hard-working men.
Bakers in this city for several years
have had to work every day the whole
year round. In the past few months the
movement was started to allow the bakers
Sunday as a day of rest, the same as
other men skilled in trade. On Saturday
the bakers quit work at 4 o'clock in the
afternoon, and they did not resume their
labors till 4 p. m. yesterday. This gave
the men a rest of twenty-four hours, and,
as some of the men stated yesterday, they
would be able to do more wlth'thls short
respite than If they worked steadily,
without a breathing spell.
The happiest men In town yesterday
were the bakers. After months of agita
tion by the Bakers* Union they had their
first day of rest, and the married men
were able to spend a few hours at home
in the bosom of their families. The fact
that these men took a respite from their
duties for one day may sound a small
Item for the average person, but those un
acquainted with the situation can hardly
realize the amount of labor the bakers
had to undergo to accomplish their end.

When Policeman Ennls called at her
home yesterday with the warrant for the
boy's arrest she was very indignant and
denounced the conduct of her son-in-law
In strong terms. She gave the officer $40
to ball the boy out and said she would
appear in court in the morning and tell
/the Judge what she thought of Gauch.
After the boy had teen booked on the
charge of vagrancy Ennls took him back
to Mrs. Hauser's house.
Two weeks ago the boy left his home at
1217VÂ£ Howard street and went to live with
Mrs. Kate Hauser. 1400 Railroad avenue.
Mrs. Hauser was the mother of Gauch's
second wife and always took an interest
in the boy William, although he was not
her daughter's child. She told tne boy
that whenever he found that he could not
bear the treatment ho was subjected to at
his home to come to her and she would
properly look after him/ She had sent him
to school and had arranged to bring the
boy up.
Policeman Ennls, one of the stalwarts of
the Potrero district, was never more un
comfortable than he was yesterday when
in the line of enforced duty he appeared
at the City Prison with a boy 14 years of
age as a prisoner. He had arrested tho
boy on a warrant charging him with va-
Krancy, and the complaining witness Â¦was
the boy's father.
The boy Is William Gauch, a bright lit
tle fellow, with the appearance of being
well cared for. His father is Adam
Gauch, owner of a newspaper route.
Gauch has been married three times,
and the boy William Is the son of his first
wife. His first and second wives died and
his third wife did not take kindly to the
children of his first wife, William and
Carrie, the latter a girl now about 3 years
of age. She whipped them unnecessarily,
so the boy says, and would not wash or
get their clothes washed. "She always
used to tell me." said the boy, "to get out
of her house and go and make a living for
myeelf. My father made me get up at 3
o'clock in the mornings and- ro with him
to deliver the papers on his route, and I
got tired of it. When I complained he
used to beat me."

ception of the production of sugar, rice,

of Irrigation, the development of the
natural resources of the Hawaiian Islands
Is stated to have scarcely begun. Recom

able to pass the required medical exam
inations; for irrigation legislation and for
a general municipal system. The report
says the present aggregate area of the
public lands is approximately 1 772 713
acres, valued at $3,569,800.
The commerce of Hawaall Is shown for
the period between January 1 and June 14,
1900, as follows:
An encouraging outlook for the Ha
waiians exists in the fact that out of
6327 owners of real estate in 1896 3995 were
pure Hawaiians and 722 part Hawaiians.
The facts are significant as showing the
ownership of homes by so large a number
of pure Hawaiians, and the evident ten
dency of the race to acquire homesteads.
The ex-President reports that there is
reason to expect that annexation Is going
to influence Hawaiian character very fa
vorably through the changed conditions
effected.' Their old dependence on their
chiefs has ceased, and they are forced to
rely more upon themselves, and their
footing with the white man In the future
will be equal. The political privileges they
enjoy in common with other American cit
izens he says, will tend to educate them
in public affairs.
The total valuation of real and personal
property In Hawaii subject to ad valorem
assessment in 1900 is $97,491,584. The re
ceipts from taxes are estimated at $1,

WASHINGTON, Nov. 18.â The decrease
of the Hawaiian race has been stead
ily prolnj? on for the past several
decades, especially the female popula
tion, according to the annual report of
ex-President Sanford B. Dole, Governor
of Hawaii. The increase of part Hawai
ans tends to keep down the number of the
pure Hawaiians. While the figures show
race progress, the census reports as to
surviving children arp discouraging. In
both the censuses of 1S90 and 1896 the pure
Hawaiian- percentage of survivors was
the lowest of all nationalities represented
In the Islands.

accustomed to speak our minds out. Freedom
of speech is one of the great rights of Ameri
can liberty.
You can turn water Into a leaden pipe, you
can force steam Into a cylinder: but try to put
light Into a pipe or cylinder and see what would
happen. Tou cannot harness or drive light. It
must 6hine out a great, brilliant, luminous, un
trammeled star to guide the children of men.
I might call a long roll of American heroes
who have died to establish this right of free
speech. The right to shine if there be- a light
to shine with has become one of the basic prin
ciples of American liberty.
There be some men who speak through the
bars of authority. Such men are narrow-gauge
men on a broad-gauge track. Scholars and
preachers have always had a bard time. They
burned preachers once. They don't bum them
now. They worry them. But scholars are still
martyrs even to this day.
Such was . the case of the professors in one
well-known Eastern university who were cited
to appear in a court of Justice. Why? Be
cause they had exercised the American right of
free speech. Now I suppose you will expect
me to epeak of Professor Ross. Well, I will.
His case Is like the one of which I have epoken.
How has It happened T Because he was a man
not afraid to speak his mind out before tho
world, fearless in his knowledge that freedom
of speech was his God-given prerogative.
Mrs. Stanford held a pair of snuffers In one
hand and a candle In the other. She has used
the snuffers and to-night there is less light in
Stanford University than there was a week ago.
I don't feel sorry for Professor Ross. I don't
feel %orry for the university, but I do feel
sorry for Dr. Jordan. If the faculty of Stan
ford, Including the president, believes In snuff

THE REV. WILLIAM RADER.
Rev. B. Fay Mills Says Stanford
May Be Deserted by Friends.
OAKLAND. Nov. IS.â The resignation
of Professor Edward A. Ross from the
faculty of Stanford University was the
text of a powerful discourse delivered this
morning by Rev. Benjamin Fay Mills at
the First Unitarian Church. The clergy
man took the position that if no more
information were obtainable upon the
causes which led to the retirement of
the eminent sociologist and appeals for a
reconsideration of the matter should fall.
Stanford University should be abandoned
by its friends. Ho said. In part:
I stand this morning in the presence of many
who6e hearts are heavy with a great sorrow,
whose minds are perplexed with serious ques
tioning, and who are either burning with In
dignation or benumbed with pain on account
of an Inexplicable blow from the hand of an
honored benefactor. We have loved Stanford
University with* great love; we have honored
its generous founders with a great honor; we
have held Its noble president and professors In
an esteem too high for words. Nowhere else In
the world do people manifest such interest In
educational Institutions as Callfornlans in their
two peerless universities.
This event is not some personal concern of
Mrs. Stanford or Professor Ross or of the In
structors and students In the university. It Is
a public affair of the deepest and farthest
reaching moral Import and importance. It has
direct relations to the State of California, to
tire United States, to the Western and East
ern worlds, to all who love truth and proirress
and to those not yet wise enough to bow at
their shrines, to our modern civilization and
the advancement of our race.
Mrs. Stanford may have erred In Judgment
and not in spirit or purpose, but this fact Is
clearly stated by all those qualified to speak
that a teacher of two of the most Important
sciences, of unquestioned character, ability and
efficiency, who is held in high favor by all the
official members of the institution of which he
Is an officer, has been dismissed from his posi
tion on account of the courteous statement of
his opinions on subjects connected with his de
partment. No excuse for the action bearing
the slightest ground In reason has been hinted
at by any of the parties concerned. It is not
an excuse to pay that this Is a nrivate insti
tution. This la not true. The streams from
this fountain flow to the ends of the earth.
Stanford University Is chartered by tho com
monwealth with great privileges, some of which
have recently been Incorporated in the constl
tional law Itself. These privileges In no prob
ability would have been granted If the accept
ance of the resignation of Professor Ross, pre
sented in June, had not been delayed until after
the recent election. But even If there were no
direct relation to the State no institution, of
learning can be a matter of private Interest
alone.
It Is no excuse to claim that the founders of
such a school may dictate Its teachings. They
may do so legally, but not morally, especially If
they write the word modern on their ban
ners, as Stanford has done pre-eminently above
all the colleges of the world. The day has gone
by when a university may be considered as an
institution for teaching dead men's ideas as
authority to the living youth. A modern uni
versity Is beyond all else to bÂ« a discoverer of
truth. â¢
If adequate reconsideration. In the light of
this thunderstorm of popular Indignation Is
possible, let us welcome It. But If this Is Im
possible, and if we now possess all the infor
mation that is to be granted, then let Stanford
be deserted by Its friends and forsaken by lov
ers of liberty for the same reason for which we
gave our devotion. Let It remain as a vine that
has brought forth wild grapes, until It shall be
loyal to Its announced principles and bring
forth fruit meet for repentance.

Extraordinary Scene in the Third Congregational Church When
Rev. William Rader Concludes Sermon on the
Dismissal of Stanford Professor.
THE scene in the Third Congrre- j
national Church last night when
the Rev. William Rader con
cluded a characteristic sermon
denouncing the action of Mrs.
Stanford in forcing the resignation of
Professor Ross from the faculty of Stan
ford University was without a parallel
the church history of San Francisco.
The preacher had wrought himself and
his audience up to a pitch of excitement
rarely seen In a church. During his dls-
I course he had several times made sensa
j tio.na.1 statements, and when, with one
arm upstretched and the other pounding
| the desk before him, he brought his re
marks to a close, the congregation forgot
I all church conventions and there was a
clapping of hands until the rafters and
wulls of the sacred e<Uflce rang with the
unwonted outburst.
The congregation that gave way to this
remarkable exhibition of feeling con
tained some of the city's most promi
nent business men. In fact, the most
noteworthy fact of the occasion was the
large number of men present. The gal
lery was sombre with the masculine ele
ment, and the bright dresses of the fair
sex on the main floor was variegated
with more broadcloth than is usual at
church services. â¢
When the applause broke out, and
with the loud palm salutes of the men
was heard the patter of women's gloved
hands. Dr. Rader loolted in surprise* at
his flock, and then seeing that It was use
less to attempt to stay the applause turned
to the reading desk and busied himself
with putting his notes in order.
The applause started somewhere in the
back of the church and in an Instant had
spread all over the main floor. Then the
occupants of the gallery became infected
with the spirit of emulation.
The sermon which so excited the con
gregation was a denunciation of the re
cent action of the heads of Stanford
ITnlversity In expelling Professor Ross
from the institution at Palo Alto, and
was in part as follows:
Our Bavlor illustrated his sermons on the
mount with two very suggestive figures. One
v.-as when he referred to the city on the hill,
which when it is lighted up at night Is seÂ«i
of all men. The other was when he told the
people that they should not hide a candle under
a bushel, but should set It In a candlestick,
where It might frtve light to all men.
These two figures are simple, but in them our
Savior strikes the radical principles of democ
racy. A candle has a right to shine, perhaps
it is Its only rlcht. If you are a light, shine
before men to the utmost that lies In your
power.
Now of the right to think. There has always
been a battle between the thoughts of differ
ent men. It Is a great thing that It Is so. Our
political and social atmosphere Is purified by
this clashing together of intellects. The primal
basis of Christ's conception of liberty is that
every man should have a right to think.
One of the things which we ehot Into the
country with our revolutionary bullets was the
right of free speech. We have struggled through
many years to gain and maintain this. It has
become an American right. We have become
Carey Nlcewonger, a prominent business
man of Stockton, is ajnongr the missing.
He arrived here Saturday moraine, ac
companied by his wife, and rented apart
ments at the Lick House: Saturday night
he a'nd his wife attended the opera and
returned to the hotel shortly before mid
night. After entering their apartments
Nicewonger said that he was anxious to
see a friend who was waiting: for him
in the lobby of the hotel, axe then left his
wife, after promising to return In a few
minutes. Since then he has not been seen.
As Nicewonger had considerable money In
his possession, and wore a diamond stud
valued at $200 and a costly gold watch,
his wife fears that something has hap
pened to him.
Early yesterday morning Mrs. Nice
wonger visited police Headquarters and in
voked the aid of Captain of Detectives
Seymour and his men. uiie cannot ac
count for her husband's disappearance,
except that he has fallen into the clutches
of some evil persons. .
"I cannot understand why he doeÂ» not
return," said Mrs. Nicewonger when tell
ing her troubles to Detective McMahon at
the Hall of Justice yesterday. "He Is a
great music lover ai;d as he knows that
I am fond of opera he asked me to attend
the show at the Grand Opera House. We
arrived here Saturday from Stockton and
made preparations to attend the opera.
He seemed delighted with the show and
after leaving- the theater we went to the
Lick House, where we are sto^Dlng-. A*
we returned to the hotel he spoke to a
man, whose name Is George Allen, and
who was evidently waitinff for him. I
believe that Alien is employed tnya real
estate office contiguous to the Grand
Hotel. Carey had my opera cloak on his
arm and I asked him to take It to our
room. When I entered our apartments ft
short time afterward, the cloak was there,
but my *husband was missing'. After
waiting some time and as he did not re
turn, I hired the bellboy to search for
him. He failed to get a trace of him, and,
becoming alarmed over his absence. I no
tified the police."
Detective Charles Crockett â¢was detailed
to find the missing man, but beyond as
certaining that he was seen with Allen
shortly after leaving the hotel he failed
to discover his whereabouts. Mrs. Nice
wonger is distracted over the disappear
ance of her husband and fears that he
has either met with foul play or is be
ing detained against his will.
After Visiting Opera He Meets a
Friend and Since Then He
Has Not Been
Seen.

STARTER Dick Dwyer arrived from
Chicago last night, and e^verythin^'
is in readiness at Tanforan Park
for the bugle call sounding post
time. Owing to the limited trans
portation facilities from Oakland several
stables will be unable to participate in
the opening festivities at the San Mateo
County track this afternoon. There is no
lack of racing material, however, for.
while the fields are not large and un
wieldy, they are select and some splendid
sport may be Jooked for. The course will
undoubtedly be heavy, but this ,will not
mar the feature of the card offered, the
Opening handicap, for there ought to be
starters enough to furnish a. superb con
test. Trains are scheduled to leave the

Jockey John Bullman seems to be of the
Industrious and saving- sort. He made ar
rangements yesterday for the purchase of
a home in Alameda. Bullman is married,
and contributes as well to the support of
his parents and several brothers and sla

Things broke very nicely for the books
on Saturday last at Oakland. "Conductor"
McManus. for whom "Dewy" Andrews Is

Atkins had been see-sawing throughout
the meeting, finally cleaning up enough to
make him a small winner.

feated the Stanford team. Stanford men
then cried bitterly: "This will be our third
successive defeat." Now both colleges
are feeding themselves great quantities
of joy and hope over the misfortunes of
their rivals, and each is laying claim to
prospective victory.
The two games on the college fields, al
though fairly wan by the visiting elevens,
were In no manner a tnif tej<t of relative
strength. Mud and inaction and lack of
spirit wera the causes. When Stanford
?.nd California clash on ThankppiviriK day
they will be as different In form and mov
ing from their temporary metamorphosis
on Saturday as day ar.d nighrr. It whs a
bad day for both, an off day, and it means
nothing more. The lack of interest and
spirit is what in reality made the playing
so poor. Thanksgiving day will bring an
other story.
Form p!;:yers might as well throw the
two games of November 17 out of the
reckoning when fiRTirinf? on the Thanks
giving match. The relative strength of
California and Stanford are the same to
day as they were a week ago. Stanford
is ready for the finishing touches â Cali
fornia is still in the throes of team forma
tion.
NEVER before 'has the intercol
k-giate football situation been
such a puzrler to unravel and
master. That is what the expert
says, and he will keep a-guesslng
until the big Thanksgiving game cf 1000
is added to the list of the nine preceding
battles.
The defeats of California by Oregon and
Stanford hy Nevada has had a lugubrious
effect upon both California universities.
Berkeley and Palo Alto are in mourning
over a pair of deaths. Yet. singularly
enough, each university shouts for joy
Â¦when it contemplates the disaster of the
other. The conditions are. to say the
k-ast, unique a.t this stage of the season,
ten days before the annual intercollegiate
struggle.
At Berkeley on Saturday last, when the
Oregon-Caiifornia e^hxti vat finished, not
a codlegian would have given two cents
for his team's chances with Stanford.
They had not heard of the Stanford game
at that time. Tfce Identical conditions ob

style, though the odds were 5 to 1 against
him. Judging from his good work, the
new courser will show the way to many
of the fast ones this winter. Fiery Face
and Olita gave a pretty exhibition in the
third round. They ran like a double team
in and out in pursuit of a hard jack, and
until the flag was raised the spectators
would not hazard an opinion of the out

In the next round by Brutus. Luck was
against the Pasha Kennels' entry. In the
second round she was forced to run three

course In quick order. Previous work cut
but little figure, Qrutus having had 71
seconds of running throughout the stake
and Wedgewood but 92. Both dogs had
made their courses short and snappy and
were comparatively fresh. A heavy play
was made on the event, the winner a fa

money. Brutus has been a contestant in
the final of many stakes, so many in
fact that the talent felt that he was due
for a bracket, but Wedgewood never let

AFTER attaching the morning
game to their credit the Hanxmen
went to pieces yesterday after
noon at Recreation grounds.
When the nine dreary innings
were finished the score read Stockton 12.
San Francisco 2. Not until the ninth,
with two men inside the tombs, did tiie
locals send a player over the rubber.
The game started with Iburg doing slab
stunts for Frisco, but as a few hits were
bunched on his delivery, Hank took him
out of the box in the third inning and
put Knell in his place. Something hap
pened to Knell soon after â In the sixth
Inning, when the fanatics were treated
to iridescent and spectacular fireworks.
Six good, fulsome hits and seven runs
were what Mr. Knell was responsible for
In a single round. Up to that stage of
the game Stockton had amassed four
runs. Then Knell became so easy to th9
Slough City batsmen that even a blind
man could pee by their faces that they
were ashamed to take all kinds of "bag
gers" thrust at them. And it all happened
with two men out. Graham, Babbitt, Mc-
Carthy, McGucken, Mocre, Streib and Mc-
Hale found the ball for long drives.
Graham finally retired his Bide by an easy
fly which could not be crrored.
In this same inning, the sixth. San
Francisco had a glowing chance to do
something but failed in signal fashion.
Krug, Pabst and Schwartz crowded the
bags. Not a man had died, but Sullivan
soon started a cemetery for his team. He
fanned thrice. Then Levy flew to Mc-
Hale and Krug was caught at the plaio
on the throw-in. Thus did Hank's chances

The clerk of Chatham Is then brought
before Cade charged with being able to
read, write and cast accounts, and with
setting copies for boys. He is pronounced
guilty and Is led off to be hanged.
Says Walter Bajehot: "An audiencÂ« which

that when a 'cttlzen* Is mentioned he does
or says something absurd."
Two other bits from "II Henry VI" must
be given. Cade, striking his stall on Lon
don stone, utters the following proclama
tion:
Now Is Mortimer lord of thiÂ» city. And
here, sitting upon London stone. I chary* and
command that, of the .city's cost, the (little)
conduit run nothing but claret wine this year
of our reign. And now, henceforward. It shall
be treason for any that calls mo other than
Lord Mortimer.â IV. vl. 1-7.
When Lord Say Is captured and brought
Into the presence of Cade the latter
worthy accuses him as follows:
Be It known unto thee by thesÂ« presence.
even the presence of Ix>rd Mortimer, that I am
the bosom that must sweep tha court clean
of such filth as thou art. Thou hast most
traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm
In erecting a jrrammar school: and. whereas,
before our forefathers had no other books but
the score end the tally, thou haat caasod print
ing to be used, and, contrary to the Kin?, hia
crown and dignity, thou bast built a paper
mill. It will be proved to my face that thou
hast men about thee that usually talk of a
noun and verb, and such abomlnabla word*
as no Christian ear can endure to hear. Thou
hast appointed Justices of peace to call poor
men before them about matters they wera not
able to answer.â IV. v^l. 32-47.
We need to remember that Shakespeare
as a dramatist was concerned entirely
with what the common people were In his
own time and had been In the past. A
dramatist has. perhaps, no call to be a
prophet. If In Shakespeare's own think
ing he caught no glimpse of the comlnsr
day of democratic institutionsâ and this
seems probableâ then by so much his
great mind failed him: so much the less
Shakespeare he. In any case a man Is not
necessarily guilty of nonsense bfcauae he
accepts truth not revealed to Shakespeare,
or even Â«to Basehot.
Before finding fault with Shakespeare
for not believing in the principle of self
government In democratic Ideals, it la well
to ask one's self. "Do I believe In self-gov
ernment? Or do I. perhaps, believe In good
government Instead?" Shakespeare has
been said to be hopelessly feudal and aris
tocratic In his political creed, but he cer
tainly believed heartily In good govern
ment. ALBERT H. TOLMAN.

to the Puritans In Shakespeare are al
ways either hostile or contemptuous? Let
a single example suffice:
MARIA: Marry, sir. sometimes he is kind or
Puritan.
SIR ANDRB"JV: Oh. if I thought that I'd
beat him like a doB!
SIR TOBY: What, for being: a Puritan? Thy
exquisite reason, dear kniuht?
SIR ANDREW: I have no exquisite reason
for 't. but I have reason good enough.
â"Twelfth Night." II. 111. 151-8.
Stratford, the home of Shakespeare's
youth and of his last years, surrendered
to Puritanism. In 156S. when the poet s
father was bailiff of the city (Mayor we
should call him), the corporation enter
tained actors at Stratford: but in 1602 the
Council decreed that any Alderman or
citizen giving his consent-to the repre
sentation of plays in the Guildhall should
be fined ten shillings. In 1612 the fine
was increased to Â£10. one-sixth of th?
price that the poet paid for the largest
house In town and the accompanying
land. The dramatist's own wife and
daughters seem to have become Puritans,
and probably felt ashamed of the -career
of the world's greatest poet.
The nobles and the Queen were as
friendly to the stage as the Puritans were
hostile. The law compelled a company
of Dlayers to obtain a license from some
member of the higher nobility, permitting
them to pursue their calling a3 his ser
vants; otherwise they were to be consid
ered rogues and vagabonds. And Shake
speare himself received the patronage of
the great. He dedicatd his poems to the
Earl of Southampton In terms of warm
affection. The folio edition of his
plavs, appearing after his death, was
dedicated to the Earl of Pembrok* and
the Earl of Montgomery, because they
had shown to the author so much
favour." The court opposed the Puritans
and encouraged the theater In 1593
three prominent separatist Puritans were
hanged for sedition. At Christmas. 1534.
a record tells us that William Shake
speare and others phiyed two comedies
before her Majesty.
Whether the poet was Influenced mainly
by the considerations that I have Indi
cated or by the natural bias of his mind,
there can be little question that Shakes
tieare favored the monarchy and aristoc
racv and disliked any attempt to ex
tend the power of the people. When old
Menenius Agrippa In "Coriolanus" speaks
contemptuously of those who sit. by
the fire and presun\e to know what s done
in the capitol" we certainly hav^ an ex
pression of Shakespeare's own attitude
toward the upstart commonality who pre
tend to have an opinion about affairs ot
government."The First Part of Henry VI"
brutally misrepresents the character of
Joan of Arc, and Mr. C. W. Thomas de
clares that '^The Second Part of Henry
VI" presents Cade's rebellion "with a
mendacity, so far as I know, unsurpassed
In literautre." Both plays have been given
the same moralâ that one of humble birth
should confine hia attention to humble
m Although many Ideas coursed through
the great mind of Shakespeaere. yet, so
far as his words indicate, he seems to
have been blind to the significance of the
ereat political movement of his time. He
probably never even dreamed that such a
government as that of our great American
republic could exist, much less that It
could show a reasonable degree of per
manence and stability.
Concerning the plays of "Julius Caesar"
and "Coriolanus," we may say that
Shakespeare only follows Plutarch In
representing- the common people of Rome
as too fickle, too Ignorant, too subject to
demagogues to deserve the slightest re
spect We are forced to agree with Corio
lanus when he tells the populace:
"He that depends
Upon your favors swims with flns of lead.
And hews down oakÂ» with rushes.
Hang; ye! Trust ye?
With every minute you do change a mind."
âI. I, 1S3-8.
But the vigor with which Shakespeare
ridicules the Roman mob goes far be
yond anything In Plutarch. It seems clear
that - the ' evil smell of- the very crowds
which thronged his theater and helped to
make him rich was most distasteful to
the sensitive player-poet. Casca's con
temptuous description of the rabble who
"threw up their sweaty nightcaps and
uttered such a deal of stinking breath" re
curs many times In different forms % in
thone plays in which the common herd
nays a part. Hazlitt. the good democrat,
dislikes the play of "Coriolanus": he Is
even led to attack the poetic imagination
Ittelf as a "monopolizing, aristocratical
faculty" of the mind. He says:
This Is the logic of the Imagination and the
passions: which seek to aggrandize what ex
cites admiration and to heap contempt on
mlÂ»ery. *Â° raise power Into tyranny and to
maks tyranny absolute; to thrust down that
which is low* still lower, and to make wretches
desperate: to exalt magistrates into king*.

THIRTY SHAKESPEARE EVENINGS.
SHAKESPEARE AND DEMOCRACY.
Police Officer J. N. Morrissey captured
James Murray, a hanger-on about th<? city
saloons, in the act of relieving John Kane
of his wordly goods in the rear of the
Whale saloon, on Third street, between
Market and Mission, early yesterday
morning. Morrissey had been watching
the actions of Murray for some time and
saw him follow Kane. On entering the
place Murray was caught with his hands
in the pockets of his victim. He was
taken to the City Hall station and booked
on the charge of robbery. â¢
Officer IX .1. Driscoll caught Henry
Smith in the act of opening the cash reg
ister in a saloon at 44 Turk street yester
day morning at 5 o'clock. He was taken
to "the City Hall station and charged with
an attempt to commit robbery.
A bold attempt to rob was reported at
police headquarters yesterday morning.
Wendell Bernhard, cashier in the Old
Louvre, corner of O'Farrell and Market
streets, was the victim. He reported that
he left the saloon shortly before 3 o'clock
to go to his home, at 12 Moss street. Just
before he reached, his home he noticed
that two men were following him. but he
dtd not 6uspect there was anything wrong.
They came u,p to him rapidly, and one of
them, drawing a revolver and pointing It
at his head, said, "Throw up your hands."
Bernhard was for an Instant nonplussed,
but quickly recovering himself he attacked
the two robbers with an umbrella that he
fortunately had with him at the time,
shouting "Police." The attack was so un
expected that the robbers got scared and
fled. They ran in the direction of Sev
enth street, and Bernhard followed them
to the corner in the expectation of meet
ing a policeman, but none appeared. He
was able to give a good description of the
two men and it will be read to the differ
ent watches.
The police are having ample evidence of
the fact that footpads are in the city, and
although every effort has been made to
capture them they are still at large. "With
in a week the bartenders in two saloons
have been held up and robbed, one in the
Mission Turn Verein Hall and the other

An ideal portion of breakfast is that
obtained from, say, four teaspoons of
Grape-Nuts and a little pure, thick
cream, either cold or hot.
This is one of the most delicious
<iii=hes imaginable and is served with-
out cooking or trouble of any kind and
o-innot he equaled in point of fopd value
for the human body.
Made by the Postum Co.. at Battle
Creek, Mich.
The Grape-Xuts, consisting larerelv
of grape-sugar, have passed through
processes similar to the first act of di-
L ration an< * are therefore most easily
'digested, and in combination with
rream they render the cream itself
easy of digestion.
Grocers sell Grape-Nuts.
One of the most valuable items iv
one's dietary is good, rich cream. The
remark is frequently made that "cream
is tod expensive to use freely." Some
;-eop!e think they must have meat
every day at io and 25 cents per pound
and do not realize that 5 cents' worth
of pure cream for breakfast will do
more to put on flesh than 25 or .10 cents'
worth of meat.
As Compared With Meat,

Troppa F and G of the Sixth Cavalry
arrived at the Presidio yesterday morning
from the Yosemlte. They are a hardy
looking lot of men. Their outdoor life
during their stay in the valley has taken
off all extra flesh and put them In as fit
condition as trained athletes. The men
are all glad to pet' back, as the winter in
Yosemite ls particularly severe.
The heavy rains of the last few days
made the latter part of the 375-mlle ride
cHsairreeable. the roads being: very mud

HOTEL ARRIVALS.
There were many narrow escapes, most
of the occupants jumping from the
windows. The town has no flre protec
tion. The tannery emploves cor'-
a lines of hose to the burning buildings,
but on account of trouble with the pump
there was considerable delay in getting
a stream on the tire and the flames got
beyond control. Nothing remains of the
four dead but a few charred bones.
The property loss is insignificant.
Otto Kauley, a gas line walker of Cou
dersport, Pa., was burned about the face
and arms and Jerry Bailey sustained a
broken shoulder by jumping from the
third story of the hotel.
One man had a leg broken In jumping
and several others received minor in
juries and slight burns in making their
exit from the hotel.
The lire originated in tho McGonigal
House from an overpressure of natural
gas. There were thlry people in the
hotel, which was a flimsy structure, and
the flames licked up the building as if It
were tinder.
OSWATO, Pa., Nov. 18.â Four men
wera burned to death to-day In a fire
that destroyed thÂ© McGonigal House, a

Colonel-oleot Thomas F. O'Neil and a
number of officers who should be in a po
sition to attend to the duties for which
they have been chosen are unable to do
so. because, tney have not yet received
their commissions. There is exceeding
slowness in the military "upper" office In
Sacramento. .
A bill is to be introduced into the next
Legislature to change the manner of
choosing the line officers in the National
Guard. It Is proposed that the only of
ficer for which there shall be an election
shall be the second lieutenant; that when
the captain from any cause shall leave
the service, the first lieutenant shall be
promoted captain and the second lieuten
ant be promoted first lieutenant, tho va
cancy to be filled by an election. If the
first lieutenant should leave the service
the second lieutenant would then be ad
vanced. , .. â

On his own application Quartermaster
Sergeant W. D. Geary of Company B was
reduced to the ranks. Private James B.
Manning was appointed to fill the va
cancy. James H. Biddle and W. C. Far
rell were appointed corporals of the same
company.
Privates "W. G. Leonard. E. W. Davis
an.! W. M. Rohrbacher were appointed
corporals of Company F, and Private C.
R. Schaffer musician.
Regimental order No. 14, issued from
headquarters of the Fifth Infantry show
the discharge of thirtyvsix menâtwenty
three on account of removal, three for
the good of the service, two at expiration
of term of service, two by two-thirds
vote and o.ne for disability.
The inspections In the Second Brigade
will be continued this week, commencing
to-morrow night, in Oakland, and then
being held In the other cities in which
the companies of the Fifth Infantry are
located.
In almost every company there was a
detraction from soldierly neatness by the
fact that a number of the men appeared
wearing tan shoes and others witn shoes
that were innocent of polish for some
time. Then the web belts, not iilled with
cartridges hung on the men in all sorts
of ways, hardly two in a platoon being
fitted on as they should be for an occa
sion like inspection. During the Inspec
tion of arms there was noticed a lacK of
uniformity in the handling of the pieces
as it was passed to the inspecting officer.
After coining to port arms some of the
men grasped the gun by the small of tho
stock and others by the heel with the left
hand, showing that their instructor had
paid but little attention to the manner :n
which they handled their pieces. Either
way would be acceptable, but to see two
methods followed Â»n the same company
made military men who were present and
who are up in the manual of arms smile.
In the matter of drill the men did not
come up to expectations, there being
many breaks in the ordinary formations,
such as "fours right," "fours left" and
"company Into line." Some of the com
panies had skirmish drill, but this only
served to show that they will require more
firactlce and closer attention to the regu
atiqns to make a good showing. There
waa halting in carrying out the com
mands and many breaks as to distance.
With a few exceptions the lieutenants
who drilled their men gave their orders in
such subdued tones that, In moving, they
could scarcely be heard. One lieutenant
in K Company created a great deal of
merriment by the manner, in which he
recovered lost -distance. In his endeavors
to do so, instead of lengthening step he
made up lost distance by skipping across
the floor, very much after the fashion of
a dancing master. It was novel, but
hardly soldierly.
The inspection as a whole shows the
need of thorough instruction In the re
organized First, also the need of recruit
ing the companies so that there shall be
at least a full minimum number in each
company. It also demonstrated the need
of a school of instruction for the
line olticers, with some one compe
tent to teach them all that they ought
to know, so that the work of the
soldier may be performed uniformly; it
also demonstrated that there ought to be
a school of . instruction for the "non
coms," for the observant eye could note
the fact that all did not perform the same
duty in exactly the same manner. It may
be said that variety is the spice of life,
but while that may apply to the ordinary
affairs of life, military discipline requires
that in the different companies of a regi
ment the same things shall be done in
one as is done in the others, without
variance to suit the whims of this or that
officer. The Inspection also demon
strated that some of the officers above the
line would profit by a careful study of the
manual of arms and the drill regulations,
for on more than one occasion questions
arose that they could not answer and they
were obliged to hold a consultation as to
the proper way to do this or that.
The inspecting officer was Major James
A. Margo, inspector of the Second Bri
gade. He was assisted by Major Phil J.
Perkins and Major A. A. Hanks of the
brigade staff and Lieutenant Colonel,
Thomas F. O'Neil and staff. Companies
A, B, D, E, H, I. L. and M and the ratji
mental band were mustered and inspected
at the Page street armory, some on Mon
day night and the others on Tuesday
night, while Companies C, G, F and K
were inspected at Ellis street on Wednes
day night. Physically and as to dress the
otticers and men all looked well.. The men
In their new uniforms and caps,* presented
a very line appearance, the clothes being
well made and fitting much better than
National Guard uniforms di.d in years
gone by. But lew of the companies came
up to the minimum number of men at
muster, as a number were away from the
city or on the eick list. Some companies
were short from four to twelve. men.
The most Important matter that oc
curred in the National Guard in this city
during the past week was the inspection
of the officers and men of the First Regi
ment of Infantry, part at the Page and
Gough street armory and part at the Ellis
street- armory.

r > I" ie still an unsolved problem.
& 1 Downstairs last night was just
tj*. I . enough cheap to be unfashlon-
able and just dear enough to
be unpopular. Upstairs was
no more crowded than it has
been right alongâ which means that It
was full to Its seating capacity It filled
for three and two dollar?, ard it filled for
two and one. and the fringe of slanders
t.ms ' no deeper for the reduction. Be
fides. it was Sunday night, and a Sunday
night audience is much like the capital
prize in a lottery.
The orchestra seats looked well filled,
but It was due In a great measure to the
art of the box office. It was a "well sold"
Fpcticn. The dress circle had room to
spare, and it cnu only when or.e mounted
to the height of the family circle that he
had to hunt for room. But two or three
procenium boxes were filled.
It waÂ«= an audier.ee. too, that seemed
Komtwhat undecided a:: to how it should
have dressed itself. The pit had its quota
of dress suits. v:ith here ard there a
budncES suit to btias floisrn the average-
The dress circle ran to Tuxedos. The gal
leries, ever independent, ran to every
days ar.d shirt-waists. It was not so
bright and highly-colored :in audience as
gathers to thrill ar.u dap and shout
"Bravo" on full-price nights, but it was
a good Sunday night audier.ee, even for
times when prices are popular in the ac
tual as well as the re'ative sense. And
what it lacked in gavety cf color war,
made up in enthusiasm. â¢ ror the popular
pricer is a mupic lover and hi? -applause
is uninliuer.cÂ«Â»d by the cost of his seat.
And there was no rush and rattle of
carriages, no shouting of hao'.imen. no el
bowing of police. Six hacks were waiting
quietly for custom when the crowd cams
out. and four of thorn were enraged.
The popular price Jhl rood where it was
most neededâ in the higher altitudes.
Lower down it ha? yet to be appreciated.
SPIRIT IS LACKING-
"II Trovatore" Is Applauded,
but Without Warmth.
By Blanche Partington.
A rather perfunctory performance on
the whole was "11 Trovatore" last night
at the Grand Opera-house. Even the or
chestra seemed to be affected, and the
house, though enthusiastic, was not wildly
so. though quite up to the measure of the
incitement.
Â¦Whatever the reason, the atmosphere
was unin?piritlng. heavy, and singers, or
chestra and house alike seemed conscious
of something lacking, perhaps thn, pei
haps that, but it was in the air. Â¦ .
Mme. Olitzka made perhaps the most
favorable impression of the evening
among the artists with her rendering of
Azucena. She has a warm, expressive
voice, Â¦with some good chest tones and a
large, easy range. The registers might
be more evenly joined and the Intonation
is not always certain, but the Azucena
was sung with spirit and was well en-
joyed.
Mme. Xordlca Â¦was heard last evening as
Leonora, and though she does nothing ill,
yet she was not at her. best last night.
Not that the voice cannot fulfill all the
vocal requirements of the role, but the
spirit of the music is essentially foreign
to her emotional key, which is lacking in
the lightness and vivacity necessary for
Its best Interpretation. Nor is the voice
itself of the right caliber; it has not suffl
cient of the lyric quality: but it was beau-

GRAND OPERA-HOUSE IN "IL TROVATORE." HER WORK IN THE
GYPSY DUET WAS WARMLY APPLAUDED.
tlfully heard and most heartily applauded
in one or two of the slower arias.
Mr. Dippel was the Manrico, and pleas
antly heard in the part. His voice lacks
distinction and climax, but it has a
sweet and pleasing quality and is well
modulated and flexible. His rendering
of the "Dl quella pira" brought down the
house and i.e was forced to repeat the
number. He acted with grace and dis
tinction throughout.
Mr. Dufriche is possessed of a fairly
good barytone voice, a bad method and a
severe vibrato. Like all singers afflicted
with a tremolo his intonation Is uncer
tain, and his Comte di Luna was an in
differently good performance all round.
Mr. Maseiro and Mr. Journet. the former
of whom sang a competent Ruiz, com
pleted the cast. The opera was well
staged.
To-night Melba will be heard as MIml,
in "La Boheme," with Campanari, Cre

Rodgers did not have long to wait, for
ho was dealt four kings a few minutes
after he had taken his seat.
with a knowing wink to his two
"friends," Rodgers bet $oO, all the ready
money he had.
"I>on't be a piker," whispered one of the

Rodgers evidently thought so, as he
took out a check. for $500. and placing it
on the table announced that he would bet

TWO MEN STABBED
DURING SALOON ROW
Albert Heins, a Marine, Arrested on
a Charge of Assault to
Murder.
Albert Ilelns, a marine, got mixed up
In a fight at 443 Bush street early yester
day morning, and is now in the City
Prison on a charge of assault to murder.
Both his eyes are swollen and blackened,
and he showed other slgnc of having
been severely punished. His recollection
of what happened is very hazy, as he ad
mits he waa considerably under the influ
ence of liquor.
It appears that Heins got into an alter
cation with F. Courser and H. Frazler,
and words led to blows. Heins opened his
pocketknife and succeeded in stabbing
Courser five times and Frazler once be
fore he was knocked out. Heins was ar
rested and booked on the charge of as
rault to murder. Courser was sent to the
Receiving Hospital, where his wounds
were stitched and dressed.
Henry Rodg-ers, a recent arrival from
the State of Washington, Is the latest vic
tim of bunko men. Yesterday, he was
walking alone Market street, when he
met two affable strangers who volun
teered to show him the sights. After vis
iting several saloons one of the men sug
gested that they call on a friend who was
living on Post street, between Powell and
Mason. Rodgers at first objected, but
when told that the "friend" was a recent
arrival from the Klondike and had
"money to burn" he consented. As they
entered the house they were met by a
well-dressed individual, who effusively
greeted the trio. After a short conversa
tion Rodgcrs was ushered into a well fur
nished room, in which three men were en
gaged In playing a frienuiy game of draw

Rodgers watched the game a while, and

and checks that littered the table con

STRANGER FALLS INTO CLUTCHES
OF A GANG OF CARD SHARPERS
Henry Rodgersof Washington Relieved of $^90 by Bunko
Men in the Manner Peculiar to Their Kind. .
The block on Page street between Scott
and Dcvh^lero is covered with broken
glass, the result of a rear-end collision be
tween electric cars inbound from the
park and ocean. It locked for a minute as
if several people would be maimed or
would lose their lives, but .by a lucky
chance the greatest casualties were
caused by the flying glass from . the car
windows.
On Sundays large electric cars are run
from the ocean into tho city -with
out transfer, and one of these had just
come down the hill on Page street, be
tween Devi&adero anil Broderick, when a
Page-street car appeared on the brow tof
the hiil abovo and commenced to de
scend. It had proceeded half way down
tho hill when it became apparent that
something was wrong with its brakes,
tor it was gathering speed at an alarming
rate, and was rapidly nearlng the car
from the ocean which was running ahead
of it. The motorman of the rear car real
ized tho danger of the passengers on the
car ahead, and as he came on he shouted
to the people on the ocean car to jump
and get out of the way before the collision
came. A good many took the advice and
jumped, several of them tumbling over
one another on the bituminous pavement,
but beyona being thoroughly shaken up
none of them waa hurt. Two boys, who
were hanging to the rear of the car,
were pulled through the rear windows
just in time to escape being caught in the
collision.
The cars had run half way down the
blcck between Devisadero and Scott when
the rear car came against the one ahead
with a crash that aroused the neighbor
hood. It bore the ocean car along past
Scott street before they were linally
brought to a standstill by the brakes of
the car ahead. In: the meantime there
was not a pane of glass left in either car.
Both were crowded, and the Hying splint
ters cut thy passengers about their hands
and faces. It looked as if some of. them
were badly hurt. Several ot the men who
jumped lound it hard to get up after they
struck me ground, and one of the ladies
fainted and had to bo taken into a near-by
doorway to be restored. The cars were
very much the worse for the accident,
but they were In condition to propel them
selves home after a little fixing.
The explanation given for the accident
Is that the brakes on the Page-street
car refused to work, and the motor
would not "slug" as it does in some cars â
that is, by the turning off of the cur
rent and the continued progress of the
car, the motor becomes for the time be
ing not a motor but a dynamo, and in
stead of using electricity it generates.
All that is generated works in opposition
to the progress of the car, and in some
Instances it will check the speed until the
car runs slowly again. Why the cur
rent was not reversed was not explained,
but the fact that the motorman on. the
Page-street car knew what was coming
ana warned the passengers ahead, seems
to point to the fact that he at least was
doing what he could to ward off the dan
ger. One of the stories is to the effect
that he saw the car ahead about to stop
and applied the brakes to his car so
forcibly that they broke.' but in any case
when the cars came together the passen
gers were all in places of comparative
safety and what might have been a dis
aster proved but an unlucky accident.
Among the passengers was Miles Shar
key. a recent arrival from Nevada. He
was sitting on the dummy when the car
ran away.
* iw tUd . not dare to Jump," he said when
telling his version of the accident, '"as
I knew that if I did I would be seriously
injured, if not killed. Just as the cars
collided I was hurled into the air, but
fortunately fell on my hands and knees.
Beyond a few bruises of the leg I escaped
uninjured."
II. -A. Meder. a friend of Sharkey, was
also on the car. Recognizing- that an ac
cident was inevitable, he jumped from
the car, unmindful of the warning of the
other passengers. Fortunately for him he
escaped with nothing worse than severe
bruises of the left arm and thlch.
MARKET STBEET CABLE
~ BREAKS AND CABS STOP
Tie-TJp of Several Hours Results
From Porting' of Great
Wire Eope.
By the partinp of the Market street
cable yesterday afternoon the entire sys
tem under the control of the trunk line
was brought to a sudden stop. The cable
parted about 3:15 o'clock. It requireu sev
eral hours to locate the ends. As soon
as they were found and hauled into the
splicing shop at Valencia and Market
streets the splicing process was started
The cars started again about 9 o'clocJv
and ran till 1. Then a permanent splice
In the cable was begun.
â¢The present cable has bÂ«en in use for
a number of years and this Is the fir^t
time that It has delayed the traffic. A
new cable will be one of the necessities
of the corporation in the near future The
Market street cable is compelled to do all
the haulinp for the McAllister, Hayes and
Haight street lines, between their junc
tions with the main artery and the ferry,
and for the Valencia street line for its
entire length. McAllister and Hayes
streets have relief cables from their Junc
tions with Market street, but when the
trunk is affected the whole system is nec
assarily tied up.
