She allowed her hands to remain in m*

"You must try to be happy with me.

on the sofa, side by side. -Â¦ *
"My father." she said, "will do any thin,

"Southwold was my mother's name."
he said tenderly. "She never belonged to
this place, no one knew anything about
her, and I didn't want to be recogniicd

to take. But now I shall return to m,

lt. too. and wa shall keep up Greenv"c

"'And we shall have an old-fashlone'l
Christmas next year." she- -exclaimed
"and every year while we live."
And so our Christmas atory comes to aa
library, the windows of which were shad
.ed by trees whose branches were now sli
ver with a frost appropriate to the sea
son. The library was a favcrlte resort of
hers, a place for. retirement and contem
plation, even when she did not happen to
be In the mood for books. This day <the

She stood at the window looking out.
Suddenly she heard a tread on the Â«oft
thick carpet behind h-erâ the sound of a
footfall which made her start and trem

nest Southwold was standing before her.
There \vaÂ« a momcnl'Â» silence and then
he spoke. -.:â¢
"I have been looking for you outside.
Miss Milllcent." he said, "and then I 'o
membered that you were sure to be her*.
I shall have to be going away very soon,
and so I wanted to see all I could of
you." â¢ ' ,
"Yes.." *he rerlled. blankly, "but why
must you go away soon?" .
"Well, my vWt must come to an enÂ»1,
and I must go my way."
"I am so sorry. I hope you enjoyed thl*
old fashioned English Christmas?"
She spoke with great difficulty and did
not seem In the least like her usual fear
less self.
"Yes, It was an Ideal Christmas. I never
before enjoyed anything so much, and I
don't expect to enjoy anything so much
ever again." , .
"What a gloomy view to take of life!"
She did not know what else to say.
Â¦"I. almost wish I. had never come here."
he said. ' "I almost wish I had never seen
â you." .. Â¦>;Â¦-. â¢â¢ Â¦-
"Oh, Mr. Southwold, how. can you speak
like that?" and with an Involuntary,
movement sheheld out her hands to him

every moment that that Christmas was

'A few. days glided' happily along In the
home of Sir Percy and Elsa. where of
course Southwold was now: a guest. The
weather was seaeraJ!}' fine ana bright,
"" "You are the kindest friends I have met
for many a Ions day," he answered; "and
I am only too clad to be with you a little
longer,' and anyhow my relatives 'are not
likely to knpw anything about my coming
or going."
.''You won't refuse us the pleasure of
your company,", she asked, timidly, "if
wo should happen to be anywhere near
your relatives?"
Then It suddenly occurred to her that he
might have some objection to spending his
Christmas In Warwickshire if his surviv
ing relatives, whoever they might be, had
their abode there.
"Warwickshire!" she exclaimed. "Why,
our county, Is Warwickshire. We are
bringing-' you to Warwickshire. We have
a house In London, but Warwickshire la
our home. I think this is a most delight
ful coincidence."
/"I think you will say." he answered
with a smile, "that It was a coifnty/to be
proud of. It was Shakespeare's own
countyâ Warwickshire." â¢ 'â¢' '';:Â¦.-';.

talk with young Southwold. and his desire
to see an English Christmas, his' long ab-~
sence from England and his melancholy
admission that he had as yet- no friends
there and no relations who appeared to
care about him.
"I told you he had some sad story be
hind him." the girl exclaimed? in a tone
of triumph.
"Look here, papa." the girl said ear
nestly. "I have a grand idea. Let us in
vite him to our place and I'll get up a reg
ular old-fashioned Christmas for his es
pecial benefit."
"My dear Elsa. what do you know about
old-fashioned Christmases?" ;>,
"I'll read it al! -up: I'll look over the
hocks in the library when we get" homo:

and Ashton's 'Old Times' and all sorts nf
things, and I shall be mistress of the rev

well and get up a genuine old-fashioned
Christmas to welcome the return of the
native." .
So she patted her father triumphantly,
en the snculder and they went on deck
together. The sea was comparatively
smooth: the moon v;a3 shining and South
weld was walking up and down the deck.
Sir Percy accosted him in his usual
genial fashion and the three were soon
pacing the deck together.
Eisa Mlllicent was an impulsive, ro
mantic, absolutely natural and unaJTecte-.l
girl. Her mother's early death had left
her for many years under her father's
sole care and Sir Percy had no idea of ai:y
other way to bring u;, a daughter thar.
Just to spoil her by letting her do prct'.y
much as she pleased in everything.
. Elsa had been Interesied in her fellow
passenger., Mr. Southwold, from the time
cf their first meeting on the American
side cf the Niagara Falls. She was at
tracted toward him In the beginning be
cause he seemed lonely, and then because,
in the course of their conversations it
ccrrc cut that, thovgh he was an English
man by birth he bad not' seen his native
country since his childhood; and the
thov.ght it charmingly odd and Interesting
that her father and she should be his cbm
iaricrrs en his first return voyage.
"So we .-hail be in Liverpool to-morrow

wiapfcd in coa*.3 ard furs, were walking
the deck and enjcy.'ng the open air. chilled
though it was. "You must bp very gl-id
to ste your native eauntry so soon
at'a ; n."
"I feel rather, nervous, somehow." ne
fa!d. *'I am afraid cf being disappointed.
I have teen making an ideal England in
my mind all these years, and now I shall

Â«:i turns out different from what I have

this voyage ever so muc:i, and I don't
know bow thinps may be with me when
I get on shore."
"Well, yc'u must let us take care of you
tor the lirst few days." Sir Percy said.
"You have given me your promise, you
know."
"iou have no friends in England?" the
gin askeu. sympathetically.
"No friends in England as yet," he
answered- and his tone, while he spokb
the v.-ords "as yet" had a peculiar Â«xprc3

"Were your relatives rich people?" she
asked. c-J-
"Yes. I believe po. I have no doubt they
are, but their ricre3 are rio't of much ac
count to me Just now," he replied. "I have
no one now to look after whom they and
their money could possibly help, even if
the help were likely to.be offered."
"Oh, I don't mean that." she said, earn
estly. "I was only anxious to know wheth
er they could have helped your father and
mother if they had known."
"Ves. they could," he answered; "tut
very likely they did not know anything
about us, and I don't want them to know
anything about me now."
Sho thought :t natural that the subject
should bring a glcom with it for him. and
she was sorry she had said a word about
his relatives, and promptly determined to
talk about something else.
"You have never asked where we liveJn
England," she said. "You have given us
your promise to spend Chrlstman with us
and the days between this and Christmas,
and had not even the. curiosity to ask
what county we live In."
"The truth is," he: said, with a smile,
"England is only England to me â just a
place with flelds and woods acd quiet old

The speaker was a hale. f.nc-loo'.:!ns:.

soon as I can."
although now and then wintry, 'and Elsa
was. able to show her guest a good deal
of the surrounding country. She had him
very much to. herself for. two or three
days because the, guests were not to ar
rive until the day before Christmas eve.
They rambled about the grounds when the
winter sun shone and th<>y rode and
drove and recounted with pride how many
miles. they had accomplished .-.within a cer
tain time along the, surrounding roads by
the speed of their bicycles. Elsa wa3
amused. and delighted to find that her
guest seemed to be able to turn his hand
to everything that called for firmness of
touch, quickness of eye, steadiness of
nerve and practical craftsmanship. Â¦Â¦: - .
"lou see," he said once. "I have been
obliged to become a sort of Jack-of-all

away for a. winter expedition, and I don't
suppose you would much care to see It."
"I am very happy where I am," South
wold said, gravely. . '--.-.,.
Then the conversation turned upon other,
subjects and presently the group went in
to luncheon, at which Dr. Wrasrge was to
make one of the company.
The Christmas festivities soon set in
nnd never had there been such festivities
known there in Elsa Milllcent's time. Elsa
organized everything herself, and she
made it clear that she had been endowed
by nature with, a perfect genius for the
part of mistress of the revels. The boar's
head, with garlands decked and rosemary,
as the old verse has. It. was borne In for
the Christmas dinner table.. There were
Christmas games and Christmas dances
in which the servants Joined, and the holly
and ivy and mistletoe hung everywhere,
and: there was a Christmas wassail bowl,

not In love with some other woman now,
whether, in any case, in leaving her home
he might not go away and forget her. If
he cared for her. If he really cared for
her; or was likely to care for her, as she
felt sure she cared for him, then all might
come right. Her father, she knew, would
never-mar her happiness merely because
her. lover might be poor, and Sir Percy
had spoken to her again and again about
their guest in language which showed
that the young man had Inspired conn
dence and aroused admiration In him.
But then â but then â the question arose,
what right had she to Indulge herself In
the hope that the stranger felt to her as
she knew she felt to him? The day was
fast approaching when the Christmas rev
elries were to come to an end. and the
last of the guests was to leave the place,
and Southwold.. having accomplished by
her -help his quest of an old-fashioned
English Christmas, would leave the place
to putsuo whatever plans he had fash
ioned or meant to fashion for hia life.

The mighty little captain struck him an

The wag of the company, limping be

"Hush," said Judith, "the others are

Now, these worthless fellows neither
greatly feared God nor loved man, and the
fact that they had Just escaped massacre

Something seemed to grip his heart. Tho

They were at a turning of the forest path.
He drew Judith back. The company was
passing from the woods Into the open.
He saw the dancing head of the Indian,
grotesque and terrible, against an open

colony.
Captain Standlsh shut his mouth grimly
and spoke not again the rest of the
march. He had been deeply shocked to
perceive there were two women in the
rogues' company, but he was .thankful to
note that they had shown sufficient de
cency and shame to draw their cloaks so
closely as to evade recognition.
He sank back into his chair. "Oh." ha
murmured, nodding. -'Ah-h-h!" And he
dropped his hand from his sword.
He sprang to his feet, h!s hand on W3

"Bend down," whispered Drusilla. She
glanced toward Mr. Thorndyke, who. now
that the danger ) was past,! had stepped
away from them. "Who Is that man? He
turned a strange and fearful look on us
when rou lauched but now.". ,
"Nay, trembler," cried . Judith with her
tinging laugh, "let us no^ despair that we

Ho, we might have been killed by the sav

Drusilla clung to her friend. "Did you

ed and shuddered.
Over Mr. . Thorndyke's shcu'.der as he
stood v.'Hh his back to her Judith could
see rr.lnglo with the Colonists, as by a
miracle, ?c?rlet-eoatcri soldiers. Their cap

Ere Judith four.d time reply an ar
row whirred by her head and fastened the
floating end of Drusllla's blue scarf to the
trunk of the tree behind them. In an
instant Mr. Ralston's sword had slashed
through the silken stuff and freed her and
the Colonists had forir.ed a bodyguard
about tho t'.vo women.

glanced back fiercely, over his shoulder.
"Ye'd best render thanks to the Lord that

Enlivened by these quips it. was a-mer

back to Plymouth. Captain Standlsh felt
In duty bound to escort the bachelors back
to the ..little town, for it was no longer
Faffi to let them remain where they were,
as the Indians would be on the outlook for
an opportunity to make a 'second attack.
He walked at the head of the procession
with his handful of sturdy; Cod-fearing
soldiers. One of them carried a pole, on
/he top of which was carried the head of.
an Indian chief killed in the brief battle.
The little captain's heart 'was sore and

by the sudden appearance cf tv:o youiv
fc-entlewomen. While the greater number
of colonists were; as he, silent for the
moment with amazement, there were sev

"Sirs," spoke Judith through the- veil

brought every man to his feet. â

would give to hear the laugh of a child,

"Ay," Joined in a third, " 'tis a doleful
Christmas that lacks the goodly company

"'Tis little Christmas pudding we eat
to-morrow," spoke one fellow, heaving a
sigh.
Now, there sixty bachelors comprised a
v.orthhrs set cf fellows who had been sent
by 2. rich company in En;;!ard to form a
colony in the New World. Many of them
were scapegrace younger sans of tr^od
families and the ethers born adventurers.
The chief condition upon which tho com
pany insisted was that they should be un
married men so that the new settlement
might not be weakened by the presence cf
x.cmen and children as was the dcjjiiscJ
Plymouth Colony. This and other line
promises the proposed colonists made
readily. But once they and their store*
were safely landed on New England sjil,
and the company':: agent had returned
home, they forgot all sense cf honorable
obligation. TJjey made no clearings in the
forest nor planted any fields. By fall thslr
stores were exhausted and as they had
made no provision for winter the first se
vere change In the weather drove them
into Plymouth. There they lived on the
chanty of the town, and excused their
presence by the plea of not having been
able to find a suitable spot en which to
found a settlement. Soon it became ap
parent to the good folk that these Idlers
who had lived so merrily all summer now
bestirred themselves not one whit to help
the general need. They went after no game
save when it pleased them, but Jested,
gossiped and smoked and separated only
at mealtime and at night, when each fel
low repaired to the home of the worthy
townsman who had given him a shelter.
But when December came, Plymouth,
fearful of tho severe winter, doubting if
her own stores would last, turned out
her unwelcome guests and bade them
make shift for themselves. Out the sixty
went, their good humor unabated, and
stationed themselves a couple of miles be
yond the town. The first two or three
weeks they lived fairly. well* hunting in
the forc-Ft and robbing the cornfields of
the Indians.
Yet, this afternoon they were a dreary
company, for none could be unmindful of
the fact that Christmas fell on the mor
row and that it wculd bring no festivities
to them. Before them lay the gloomy
ocean, behind the dark forest. A winter
thaw was melting the snow. They were
glad to take advantage of the almost
balmy air and so sat around on logs in the
sunshine; their poor frippery of once gay
attire mocked their manhood; most..cf
them were unwlgged; the buckles on their
shoes were gone; their store of powder
was well nigh exhausted.
"Quick, stupid!" commanded Judith,
waxing argry, "and draw yoiir hood well
about your. face, to your very eyes, lest
v:e be reccsjnized."
tacfcelcis! Ch, Judith, my knees' give
way! Think yeu this scarf becomes me?
Let us go hence! 'Tis an unma'denly pro

cut of it!"
"Corce, come," frowned Judith, " 'tis
past t!n-.e to dilly-dally."
"Ch, my poor heart!" crii-d Drusilla;
"ch, my poor knees!"
"Nay," commanded Judith, rising;
"watch my words and fall in wl|h me.
Sixty bachelors! Sixty sticks ! v <U5ixty

placed your heart on a man o' pretty
parts, you'll be surprised to find how lit
tle the rest of his kind matter. They
fright you no more than they were sixty
little birds perched in a tree. Yet let the
one man appear and your, heart knocks
loud against your ribs."
"Then love I cannot know," eaid Drusil

"I fear me we have- been o'er bold and
urmaidr-nly," Sighed her companion. "Oh,
let us slip away before we be set upon and
discovered."
"Will you take him for a husband T'
teased Judith. "He wears love-curls and
has a pretty leg. The very man. to please
your fancy." Despite her jesting her ex
pression was anxious and most troubled.
"Perchance he should rpy us through
the branches." murmured Drusilla,
"Oh. you so bent on love and marriage,"
raid Judith, "here shall be your pick of
sixty bachelors." She dropped to her knees
behind some bushes and drew her com
panion down beside her. " "Tts most des
olate." she continued, peering through the
branches. "They sit smoking after the
practice of the savages. The one who is
ringing looks this way."
Laughter reverberated faintly in the
pauses of a song. Soon they drew near
enough to distinguish the Â¦words.
"Hist," said Judith, "they sing a drink
ing song."
"I hear no woman's voice," quavered
Drusilla.
The woods edging toward the sea were
becoming thinner. They stepped cautious
ly and spoke in whispers. Suddenly sounds
other than those common to the forest
greeted their ears and revealed signs of
human habitation.
"Nay, you are fanciful," replied Judith,
sturdily, "and if you did, there were no
danger. Have not the savages and the
Plymouth folk lived In peace with one
another to this very moment?"
"I have a dread that some one follows
us," said Drusilla, glancing back over her
shoulder. "I thought I saw an Indian."
"So, forsooth, shall I," answered Judith.
" 'I did take a walk in the forest, sir,'
I'll say. 'in quest of romance and merry
auventure. As for any other motive, why
that, God wot, be my own secret, which
I hold with a clear conscience and is not
for your hearing.' "

Captain Shrimd
a story of ChristmasHut it wasn't all. Farquhar's arm was
broken and there was fear of concussion
of the brain. Not until late at night did
the post surgeon return to Foster. "The
boy's a mass of bruises." said he. "But
wasn't it plucky? He held on nearly half
a mile."
Not until two days later did they move
Farquhar out to the post, and meantime
there had been no end ofâ taik. -
TO begin with, who fired that shot and
why? And whither went the bullet? It
came, said prominent citizens, from the
aUey next to the express ofllce. They had
. not seen the perpetrator; but some ono
hadâ a womanâ for it was current on the
streets of Foster City that a woman s

ceded but a second the sound of the shot.
Perhaps that's what made the pistol carry
wild. Two hangers-on at the hotel vowed
the cry came from Mrs. Welland s Iip3.
There was a maze of yards, narrow pas
sages and little wooden buildings all
"through 'the middle of the block, and it
waa easy for a man to slip away. Wel

known to have gone to town that night

about the bars, taverns, etc., and making
inquiry. ' -. . . . , ,
Town go??lp3, ever agog for scandal in
the army, took that visit to mean that he
was "hunting for the feller that he had
hired to shoot the leftennant for courting
his wife." And there were not lacking
pood folks at the fort â¢ to accent tha:
thrilling theory. But Welland was a
sphinx. Only to Gwynne did he open nla
llpsÂ«. and from that interview the major
came home looking dated. He dodged his
wife and hovered about the door of
Nellv's maiden bower t'.a though he longed
to speak with his child, who plainly
showed fhe didn't wish to see him or
anybody els*: for the news of Jimmy

their snowy wake. Now, heading straight
for .the fort, they entered on the home
stretch. It was Welland's team of fiery
blacks and Welland's beautiful sleigh
T^or the -; wreck ,.-". of it. A moment
more and : they came tearing through
the gateway; heedless of the sen
try's abortive attempt to halt, them.
Another Instant and they flashed un
der her window, and troopers came
running across the parade and offi
cers slam,med out of doors and scurried
up the row, and poor Nell sank in. a
trembling, sobbing heap on the floor, and
covered her eyes. The nerves were, in
deed, gone. It was still, light enough to
see when the relief party came in w*th
the remnantsâ Mrs. Welland, unhurt, but
sore in spirit, robes, bundles and boxes
distributed all the way from town, but no
Jimmy. The major, of course, had gone
to\ondole with Welland and Mrs. Major
with madam. Both looked white, said the
men, and black, said the women. Many
of these last named ministering angels of
the garrison had hastened.. of course, to
t-ee'what they could do for her,' and found
that* very pretty little woman pallid but
ur.acqountably .composed. and even
unevaslve. To' each woman who entered
in turn' she patiently told the story. They
had gone' to get certan packages at the
express office. These were safely stowed In
the sleigh. Mr. Farquhar, reins in hand,
was just stepping In beside her when a
shot ;was flred near them. The horses
started violently, jerking Mr. Farquhar
eff his feet. 'Then away .they tore, the
reins. over the side, and Jimmy Farquhar
hanging 'on to them like grim death, was
dragged head foremost-over the icy road
until knocked senseless . against a rock.
She" was pitched Into a drift, and-that
was all.
The 20th came on Sunday and they had
evening service at the fort and a famous
missionary Bishop preached peace on
earth and good will toward men. whil-*
most of his hearers locked askance at one
woman â pretty Mrs. Welland. who, for
her part, looked even more pious
than usual. "They're the worst kind."
said Mrs. Gwynne. who was neither pret
ty nor pious. Nell had begged oif church.
She had a headache, was the plea. Mr3.
Gwynne was for making her go le*t the
whole garrison say she was miserable on
Jim Farquhar's account. "Let 'era say it.
growled the major between his teeta.
"She sha'n't go to be stared at. any
how." And he took nis girl in his arm.*
and kissed her and felt like blubbering to
her that he was an ass and had mixed
things badly, but chok?d and broke away.
The crescent moon was hanging low in
the west. The stars sparkled in the clear,
cloudless sky. It was her heart that
ached, not her head, and the glri longea
for free air. Accustomed from childhood
to trot about the post at any hour before
the sounding of lights out she never hesi
tated now; but. warmly cloaked and hoou
ed. her slim feet in fur-Une<i overshoes,
out she went Into the keen, biting air,
and up the row she turned away from
the lights of the club, the store, the bach

ried folk. Only the little fanlight over
the door showed at Welland's. All wad

she passed with swift. Hgnt footsteps.
Everybody seemed over at chapel In de
ference to the mission. But there, near
the north end of the row, was the littl^
cottage the boys had long since namei
"Saints' Rest." where, to their immens^
glee and her utter joy. Jim Farquhar had
moved in and taken *a. room under the roqÂ»
of Galbraith Barclay. Â¦ â¢
"Parson Barclay." a God-fearing. God
serving soldier and gentleman, the whole
regiment honored, even if they could not
imitate. It meant that Jimmy ifltant to
cut loose from "the boys," to save money
and study. He had so told her the day
the squadron unsaddled from the winter's
rest, and now â and now. with hardly a
month gone by. had ha not gone, if her
mother and others were to be believed,
from what might have been bad to what
must be infinitely worse? Had he not
turned from her to thatâ to thatâ she
could not say the word. She couui not
turn back without one longing look at the
dim light In the window she knew well to
be his, the window of the room where he
lay in fevered torment, where she â that
other womanâ that very day had sat by
him nursed him. called him Jimmy, as
those townspeople said she did that cruel
day. Across the parade the chapel lights
gleamed through the ntght. She could see
the black groups of soldiers hovering
about it, showing that the little building
must be packed within. The walk ended
abruptly at the fence along the icy river,
and It was time to turn back. One more
lingering look she gave at that window
on the homeward way. then horror!
What was that afar oft along the row?
Crunching feet! Jovial voices! Beyond
r.oubt Dana. Frost and some others or
the boys coming up to inquire for Jimmy.
And they would meet her and know
whither she had gone! Not for worlds!
With the quickness of thought she dipped
through the gateway of Captain Oresrsr'3
axial-tors, scurried around in the shadows
to the back of the house, out at the rear

It was her first "grown-up" party, and
Jimmy Farquhar, the best waltzer In the

times: and here he was now â and Â¦wound
ed, and a hero, and that wicked story, all
âtrash!
And yet they had a merry Christmas,
an exceptionally merry Christmas at Fos
ter that winter. A story, only half sus
pected hitherto, came fully to light. At
the bedside of a wounded prodigal, hum
bled and repentant, a father's heart had
been poured forth In mingled gratitude
and forgiveness. For years he had borne
with the wayward lad. his only son. first
for love of the boy himself, then for the
sake of the fond woman who had shielded,
him so long and died praying for that
boy's redemption. But the last poun>l
came when Wellarul married a second
time, and found that the money his pretty
young wife so frequently begged of him
"for kindred in distress" really went to
his unworthy son. The boy's threats of
suicide or of shooting his father had ter
rified her into acquiescence. Then Wel
land drove him from his doors, and tha
boy followed them to Frayne. and there

with him and strove to make a man of

the son repeated his demands. The father
placed money for htm in the hands of un

again sent him forth. But this December,
violating his solemn word, here he was

declaring that if she betrayed his presence
he would kill her or him. or both, and
then make away with himself. She dared
not tell Welland; she did tell Farquhar.

Major Gwynne had practically ordered the
boy to keep aloof from his daughter. Then
she saw that her young knight of the
Frayne days was utterly unhappy, and
she extracted his story. "Other plans, in
deed!" said the little woman, in wrath;
"I'll bring the Gwynnes to their senses."
And just what mischief she might havo
done to her own affairs In mending:
Jimmy's, goodness enly knows. Just in
the nick of time that drink-maddened
stepson of hers had dared to let drive a
shot the day she and Farquhar went for
the Christmas things she had ordered
from the East, and so led to onÂ© blessing

his father's desk the night of the Bishops

of his iniquity. All Foster, without know

pretty Mrs. Welland and Farquhar and
Nellie Gwynne were severally instru

could only judge from what we saw, you

But the night of the big post Christmas

let Jimmy dance, but did let him down

"But where are you going to get It?"

two dimpled arms and drew the mother's
head down to kiss her again.
"Dear Santa Claus," she said, "then you
haven't forgotten me!"
The mother crept back to the fire and
sobbed, sobbed quietly under her breath,
determining at last that she would not
break the baby heart for the sake of a
shilling or so. She would part with her
ring.
"Yes, I'll pawn it, then it needn't go for

She held her hand down in the red glow
of the fire. A little flame shot between
the bars and cast a light upon the two
rings which adorned her hand: One was
the badge of wifehood, the other was a
broad gold band with "Mizpah" graven
upon it. It was the last of her wifely
treasures, Â¦ this simple golden circle, and
as she gazed at it with eyes -from which
the tears were not*far distant, a line from
the book came to her: "He-that giveth to

When Beryl's prayer had come to an
end. Mrs. Drummond found herself widely
awake. She went back to her chair by
the small tiro and. resting her elbows on
her knees, her chin upon her hands, she
sat starinp into its red heart, her heart
all in a flutter and fit to burst. "What
am I to do?" her thoughts ran. "How
shall I face these children on Christmas
day it I have nothing with which to keep
it up, and the old traditions? What shad
I do? I must hoard every penny for Jack
âit is the difference of life and death U,
him. Oh. I would that I had the faith
that my little child has. She believes that
he will send somethingâ that he will an
swer. I have lost all my faith; I know
that he has deserted me." * '
Her thoughts went back over the
Christmastidcs which had gone byâ the
gay and festive days of her girlhood when
she had coupled the days to the Christ
mas holidays, when she should leave the
fashionable school where she was edu
cated and go home to revel in a real coun
try Christmas.
She remembered how â¢ twice she had
taken home a girl because her people were
in India and she had nowhere to go
What a life that girl had! Indian luxury
for ten years, then six years of school
life, with everything that could be paid
for, but with her homo 7000 miles away
and not a single relation living in the
mother country. bhe remembered how
Mary Wlnnlngton had jumped for joy
when she had given her her mother's let
ter to read, in which she had bidden her
to bring her to Edenhall. and she would
take care that she had a good time. Then
a change nad come into Mary Winning
ton's life, la one week her father and
mother, with their huge Indian income,
were gone, and for the child left behind,
all those thousands of miles away, there
was nothingâ or next door to nothing.
Then Mary had been relegated to a dif
ferent position, made a governess pupil,
to mind the little ones, to teach them mu
sic, to help to darn their stockings. She
had only gone once to Edenhall after the
change in her fortunes. A few months
after she herself had left school her fath
er had been taken away; that meant a
change also, because the estate went to a
distant cousin,- and Mrs. Percival founa
herself with an income which seemed to
her a mere pittance.
To the villa at Brighton, where they
had pitched their tent, she had invited
Mary Winnington but once; and even then
she had gone to them with some difficulty.
For several years she had kept up a
somewhat desultory correspondence with
her and then she had iost sight of her al
together. Only once. . indeed, she had
heard anything of her and that was when
going to say good-by to her old school
mistress a few days before her own mar
riage, she had happened to notice Mary
Winnlngton's photograph standing, upon
a little table near one of the windows of
the great drawing-room at Beauchamp
House, that select establishment for

So for a little while mother and child sat
there quietly by the fire, and then Mrs.
Drummond whispered that It was time
Beryl was asleep, and carrying her across
the room she put her tenderly into the
little hard bed. *
"You are sure you are warm enough, my
hor.ey?" she askeO.
"I wasn't very warm last night,
mother." said Beryl.
She hated to make a complaint, but her
mother had put a direct question and the
child was truthful.
"I'll put my cloak over you, my thick
cloak. We have the beneut of me rtrc,

her tenderly she left tne door ajar and
went back to her vigil beside her sick hus

He slept serenely on. Once or twice
Mrs. Drummond rose in her chair ana
watched him. Yes. he was certainly bet
ter. The change which the doctor nad
predicted had come at last, and being in
the rrime of life h<- would, with care, re
cover and be as strong and well as ever.
With careâ yes. the Kind of care that
meant money, and she had no money, or
what seemed to her like none. She must
husbai:a every penny, every farthing, no
that Jack might have nouriÂ«*iment that
was absolutely necessary, even if she
should beg. borrow cr steal it, to make
him his own man again.
She put off her dress and drew on a
warm, padded dressing gown, one of the
few remaining comlort*< of her better
days. She was terribly tired and heavy
with sleep. The sick man was lying right
across the not very large bed. "I will
lie down by Dolores," the wife thought
"and draw the rug over me. Then 1
shall be ready If he stirs."
She was just turning away from her
husband's bed when the sound of a voice
In Beryl's tiny room attracted her. Shf
crept softly across the floor and listened
Perhaps the child was only talking in her
sleep. But it was not bo. As the mother
stood there listening a pitiful little voice
scarcely speaking above a whisper, came
to her.
"Oh, dear God," it said, "perhaps it is
wicked to ask you to do something for a
little child. Doloresâ she is my sister, you
know â is so little she can't understand
about Santa Claus. I, of course, know
that there isn't a Santa Clausâ that it's
only mother, and mother doesn't want to

twoâ Just something to put In her stock

pathetic voice went on: "Jesus Christ

arm and drew her into the shop.
She ordered tea In a brisk, businesslike
kind of way, and then drew her chair up
to the little table. . * <
"Now," she Â«aid, "tell me everything!
You married, of course; what is your

ly. "My husband was in the One Hun
dred and Tenth Dragocns, but two >>ars
ago we lost practically everything we haci^
Since then"
"113- poor dear." interrupted the other,
"what an awful time you must have had!
And two little children, too! And It la so
hard for any army man to rind work
again."
"Yes. he did find work â but O Mary,
he's been so frightfully 111; this is the flm
day I've left him for weeks. O Maxy.
I suppose I ought not to have come; â but
â last night I heard* my poor baby praylns
'that Christmas would come and that little
Doloreg would not be disapp^/lnted. It cut
me to the heart"
"My poor dear, cf course It cut you to
the heart, and of course you wanted to
give the little dariin^ Its Christmas â what
an unnatural beast of a mother you would
be if you didn't! I am sure that I can
help you." ; â¢
"No. no: I wasn't complalnlner. Mary."
"Of course not. but if I can do anything
for you It will only be a pay back again.
Do you think I have forgotten when I was
alone, far away from my mother and
father, thatâ we needn't go Into all that.
"We are old chums: you have happened on
evil days and I am richâ rich. I married

the world, and the kipdest and most ten

who g-oes to the city every day. and gives
me every blessed thing I want, and will
be only too glad of the chance of doing
something for an o.d friend who gave me
all the brightness that came Into my life
when I was a poor little spoiled Indian
waif, practically as homeless and or
phaned as I was afterward in reality.
Now. we won't discuss the question, be
cause I'm going to have my own way.
You used to always take cream In your
teaâ try this ttacake. I told her to swim
it in butterâ sugar, dear? And now tell
me. what has been the matter with your
husband?"
"Pneumonia." said Ethel.
"Oh, dear, dear! I suppose there would
be no chance of moving him. then?"
"Not yet. I think." sa:d she.
"N'ot if I had foot-warmer3 in the car
riage and eider-dowr.s. and all that sort
of thing? You do look so tired and worn
out. I can't bear to see you. Who ia with
him now?"
"Only my littte Beryl."
"How old is she?"
"Only 10."
"Poor little mite! We m-j3t contrive to
alter that. \V hen we have had tea I will
drive you home, after we have bought a
few toys, and see if we cannot at least
get him moved betore Chrirtma9."
"Moved-rwhere?" said Ethel, blankly
her breath almost taken from her. '
"Why. to my house, of course. I have a
great big palace facing the park and only
one child to make a noise in it. and I was
married for five years before I had him
and I don't believe there will ever be an
other."
She talked on in the kindness of her
heart, giving Ethel Drummond time to" re
cover herself, and then she Ivustled her
into a big toy shop and bought Christmas
gifts with a lavish hand.
"I am perfectly sure," she said, as they
drove through the mean streets to the lit
tle house where the sick man lay "that
we could get him moved to-morrow or the
next day."
Ethel Drummond caught at her old
friend's hand and blurted out all that was
In her heart.
"Mary." she said, "you are so good to
do all this, but It will only take us out of
our misery for a little time and give us a
taste of what we once had. Better leave
us alone, dear: believe me. It will be the
kinder way."
"Nonsense! You don't know what it la
to be in business. My husband is like the
centurion. If that Incident were to hap
pen nowadays. It wouldn't be with a cen
turion, but with a business man. My
good Hermann can make a billet for your
husband with a stroke of hia pen. and
to please me will nush him on till he won't
know that he didn't begin life as a busi
ness man himself. Now. don't thwart me
Etlel; you know I always used to bully
you In the old days. Ah, is this tho
place?"
y.ra. Drummond got out of the car
riage, still carrying her sixpence-ha'penny
doll, like a woman in a dream.
"Yes. all the parcels. Jame9." said hia
mirtress: "just knock at the door, no,
don't carry them in for me."
A dingy child answered the door, and
Mrs. Drummond's old friend swept con
fidently into the narrow passage.
"Now. Ethel, you show me the way."
Mrs. Drummond led the way up the
narrow stairs, but on the first landing
she paused.
"Mary." she said, "do you know that
you haven't told me your name yet?"
"Have I not really? That was stupid of
me! It is Meyerâ Mrs. Hermann Meyer."
As they mounted the second flight of
stairs, the door of the Drummonds' room
opened and Beryl peeped anxiously out.
"Is It you. mother?" She drew back at
the sight of a gorgeously attired lady,
whose velvet and furs seemed to over
flow the narrow way.
"Come here, my darling: duck." said
Mary Meyer. She slipped down upon her
knees as she reached the top step and let
her armful cf parcels find a place, upon
the floor. "My dear little duck." she
said, taking the child's two slender hands
and drawing them up to her breast, "you
don't know who I amâ I'm the Christmas
you prayed for last nightâ I'm Chri3tmas
and Santa Claus all rolled Into one, and
the.little one shan't be disappointed, and
there will be no empty stocking thla
Bgafn and stealthily pur a few hits of
coal on the redhot cinders. She felt
stronger and lighter of heart than 3h<Â»
had done for many days. She had got
over a great difficulty, because for the
past few days the fear of corning ill had
rested heavily upon her. She had solved
the great difficulty of Chrlstmastide. an\1
though it had cost her a pang, still the
'^parg -was over.
I Then she crept to her narrow bed again
and slept as only a woman can sleep who
has passed many nights in vigil.
The following afternoon, while it still
v.anted two days to the great festival of
the Christian year. Mrs. Dnimmond an
nounced to her family that she was going
out.
"You are quite sure. Jack, that you are
better?" she anxiously asked her hus
nand.
"Yes, I am much, much better. I'm not
like the same man."
"Then you think I might go out for ha^f
an hour, cr even more than half an hour
perhaps?"
"Oh. yes: do. dear. Beryl here will look
after me. won't you. olu lady?"
"Oh. yes. father. I'd love to if mother
will tell me just what [ ought to do and
what I ought not to do."
"Well, near," said her. mother. "I'll
leave father's be*?f tea .here In this cup
ready for him and you won't let Dolores
get near the fire, will you? Have her here
on the mat and then you'll have both
your charges under your eyes. I've a lit
tle matter - of business â very important
business â I must atte:ia to, so you'll take
great care of each other. And you'll oe
very good, my darling?" she auued to Do
lores.
"Yes; I'll be very good." Then turning
her bis blue eyes up toward her mother,
she said: "If I'm not jjood Santa Clau-s
will leave my stocking empty."
"Shâ shâ sh!" said Beryl, under her
breath.
The warning tore of the little mothe;
was not lost upon Mrs. Drummond, and it
was with the tears very near to her eyes
that she get irot of the room and went
quickly down the narrow stairs. '
Oh. what a bitter biting day It was: a
black Christmas, stingirgly cold, but
dirty and slippery under foot. She walked
quickly ui>- the narrow street till she
reached the main icad where the 'buses
ran. but she tlitl not take her place In on?
of these humble vehicles yet, but walked
steadily on till she reached a small jewel
er's r.-ith a side entrance, with which,
alas! Mrs. Drummond had of late become
intimately acquainted.
She drew the ring off her finger, de
manding a lean of a sovereign or. it. The
rran behind the counter was a new assist
ant," and thrust it -back to her: "Seven
anri-six," he said, curtly.
"Seven-ancl-six!" echoed Mr3. Drum-
mond. "Why, it c^st "
"Sfcven-a,nd-sJxâ not a penny more,"
said the man. uncompromisingly.
She sighed and pushed the ring back to
him again. "You are very hard," JhÂ«
murmured.
"Business! is business, miss." replied the
i.-.an: "name and address, please."
Eventra'ly Â«he found herself tn the road
again and walking toward London. She
walked on until she came to the point
where for a penny she could be carried
by I omnibus as far as her deslnatton.
For some reason, why she hardly knew.
hÂ«r instinct led her to go to look for
Christmas among the gayly-lighted shops
of Wpgt bourne-grove. Once she had been
accustomed to going to the most expen
sive shops and buying her Christmas gifts*
with a lavish hand, but now. when she
must husband every penny, she passel
the length of the principal shops, looking
eagerly Into every window so that she
might get the utmost value for tyer money.
At last she ventured to buy a doll for
sixpence ha'penny; it was slightly dam
aged and was a bargain. Everything else
in the shop seemed to be beyond her
means, so she paid for the doll and passed
out into the street again. Just then .1
basketful of gayly-colored balls, which
was standing by the door, | attracted her
attention. She turned to look at them and
collided with a lady who had Just eot out
of a carriage.
"Oh, I'm so sorry," she said.
"I believe it was my fault." said the
other. "I hope I didn't hurt you?"
"Oh, no. rot at all."
Then some familiarity in the voice of
each struck both women at the same mo
ment, and they turned and looked keenly
in each other's face.
"Why. Ethel Perclval!" exclaimed the
lady with the carriage.
"Is it really you. Mary WInnington?"
cried Mrs. Drummond. "What years It is
since we met!"
"Nay. I'm not Mary Wlnnlngton now,"
rejoined the other; "but tell me. do you
live in London â do you live near here?
That parcel looks like a doll? Are you
marriedâ have you any children?"
"Yes. I am married," said Ethel. "I have
two children. 1 don't know," she added,
hesitatingly, "that I can say truthfully
that we live anywhere now. We are stay
ing not very far from here"
The sharp eyes of her old friend had
gathered already that her old school fel
low was in anything but affluent Circum
stances!
"Look here." she said, abruptly, "never
mind my bit of shopping; it will do to
morrow quite as well. .Get Into the car
riage and come and have a cup of. tea
with me and a good talk."
Mrs. Drummond turned and looked at
the carriageâ at the tall horsea. Important
looking coachman and attendant footman.
"Thank you a thousand times. Mary: I
can't come to-day. I am glad to have
seen you, but I don't think we can see
very much of each other if your house
matches your carriage and your dress."
she said, in a choking voice. "I should
be utterly out of keeping with It."
"Nonsense, nonsense!" said Mary, al
most brusquely. "But stay; it would be
a waste of time to go home when we can
have a cup of tea together here as well
as anywhere else. Come in here with me;
they give you excellent tea here."

EpeaJcer. "that Santa Claus ever forgets,

*"Ves. of course It is mother, and father.
too, when he is riot ill. I never could tell."
Beryl went on In a wise, reflective voice.
â¢"why they always pive Santa Claus the
credit of making: Christmas."
"Don't you think that mother will be
able to pay for Santa Claus' things this
year. Beryl? Is Santa Claus a pay-at-the
door gentleman?"
'I believe hÂ«Â» is," said Beryl. She knew
in her heart that Santa Claus was only d
pav-at-the-door gentleman in a sense, but
she felt, this o]<1-fa<=hicncd little maid t.f
1" years old. that it was no use trying to
explain to the childish mind of little
Dolores what was the exact truth.
"At a'! events." she went on. "at all
events mother won't be able to pay for
much this Christmas, so wed belter make
up our minds to expect very little, or
?Â¦ven nothing, because now father Is ill
and everything: is rlifferem to what it used
to be, it is no i'se worrying mother about
it."
â¢"But." persisted Do'ores. "we must hive

"I don't know whether we shall." said
Beryl. "1 believe Santa Claus only goes
to riclj houses. I think he Is a mean old
thins, really."
She had a childish idea of putting the
blame, or what seemed like the blame, off
hT mother's shoulders on those of San
ta Caus. Bat. as I said, she felt, with
the wisdom of ten years, that it was no
use trying 10 make little Dolores under
stand the great truth that she had found
out for berveU that Santa Claus was only
mother in disguise.
Although thew limes were so sadly dif
ferent to what they had been but, two
years 1-efore. Bvryl herself was old enough
to remember when they had been compar
atively srell offâ what seemed to her at.
this moment quite rich people. She re
menattered thai race at the very bottom of

said: "I am too nig to go into a stocking,
dear little lleryl. I shall be at the front
door at 11 Â«Vciock."
How eagerly she had watched the clock
until the hour of 11 had come, and had
gone trembling to the front door to see
Â¦what surprise should be waiting for her.
tt~al there she had found a pony, a dear
liul<- Sheltie. standing in a tiny cart no
bigger than a wheelbarrow, and a charm
ing little eide-saddle occupying the front
Koat. Well she knew there would be no
Eheltle this Chr.stmas; she guessed there
crould be little or nothing. She was too
young to know the exact cause of tl.e
chancre which had taken place in their
oeryday life. One comprehensive phrase
j-ummwi up everything: "Father had lost
his fortune." Servants had disappeared
along with the Sheltie and the dogs. The
chargers and the hunters, with mother's
smart frocks and father's scarlet hum ing
coat, they were all cone: and now their
world had niovt-d to a hideous little house
in a back street In Shepherd's Dush. and
Beryl had learned exactly what it meant
to be behindhand with the rent.
She was a very plucky child, little Beryl
Drummond. It never occurred to her to
rapine for herself, for her own sake. The
dominant ideas of her young life were,
first, of helping mother, and. secondly, of
keeping little Dolores from realizing too
murh the difference between this life and
the old one.
The shabby little house in Shepherd'i
Bush was not entirely occupied by Cap
tain and Mrs. Drummond. They had but
three roomsâ a small, barely furnished
Fitting-room and a smaller bedroom next
to it. from which led a third tiny room but
little larger than a cupboard, in which
Beryl slept, while the yourwrer child slept
in a" little bed beside that of her parents.
"Do you think." little Dolores went on.
"do you think. Beryl, that there is any
chance of our having just something in
our stockings? I wonder." she continued,
as Beryl did not answer, being, if the
truth were told, racking her young brain
that she might find some reasonable ex
cuse which would, as it were, pave the
way if the worst disappointment should
.happen. "if mother would let me go to
bed now. It Is so cold in this room. '
Beryl turned her grave young eyes on
the dying fire, which had never been,
during that bitter December day. more
tiian a handful.
â¢'Yes. I would go to bed if I were you.
I'll esk mother."
â¢â¢Do," echoed Dolores. "It would bring
Christmas day one day nearer."
The elder <hild rose from where she
had been sitting on the hearthrug, and,
passing to the door of her mother's bed
room, entered: '.Z-- s \ â .
"Mother," she said. * may Dolores go

The mother passed Into the slttlng

"I would like a Ht of bread and butter,

The Littl e Empty
Stoking(Copyright, Tupper Syndicate. 1900.)
JACK REDMOND closed the cabin
door behind him, and, taking his
derringer from his hip pocket, .ex
amined it with care." He did not*
propose there should be any mistake
made.
He had decided to blow out his brains.
It was the only solution of the problem
of his existence. Life had become an ab
solute failure. Fortuneâ the jade!â had
deserted him. He had not a friend on
earth save "Pard," his dog. What was
there to live for?
"So I'll try the country t'other side of
the range," he said carelessly, as lie ex
amined his pistol. "Perhaps there I'll
find the treasure I've always looked for
here, although, deuce take me. I'm afraid
don't know what to do," he sobbed. . "I
cah't wake my papa. He has his face
turned to the wall and he won't speak
to me. And oh, he's so. cold!"
Jack started a bit and looked serious.
Ho had remarked his neighbor, a quieti
retiring fellow, who kept to himself and
never mifigled with the toughs, gamblers
and other choice saciety of the Gulch. He
remembered the delicate white face with
bright red spols on either cheek and the
attenuated frame. He sat down and held
out his hand to the child. "Don't cry so,
my boy," he said, gently. "I'll go with
you and waken your father. It's all right.
He has overslept. Tell me, have you had
any breakfast?"
The child had crept timidly to his side
and was leaning against him, trying to
check his sob?. Pard stole up and licked
his poor little red hands.
"See, my -dog likes you already." said
Jack, cheerfully. "You and he must be
great friends. â¢ Now I'm going to cook you
â¢some breakfast, and then we'll go back

"O, my boy. my boy!" he cried; "U
there anything on earth too good for you?
Well, I guess not. Tell me, what do you
want for Christmasâ tell meâ tell rnt>!"
He was roused by Pard'sTongue on his
cheek and by the child's cries of distress.
Sitting clumsily up against the side of
the cabin, Jack asked Arthur to bring
him a cup of water. This the boy has
tened to do. After drinking. Redmond
took the specimens of ore in his hands.
No, there was no mistake. It was the
gold he had looked for so long. Foundâ
found at last! One treasure found by an
other. He was a rich man-rich! Ho
looked at the boy. standing by with anx
ious face, worried over his new father's
strange behavior.
He held out his dirty little red hands.
Redmond save one look, then dropped on
his face.
"Look!" he cried, as they came racing
down the hill toward the cabin. "Look
at the pretty stones Pard and I found In
the tunnel.. Pard was digging and scratch-
Ing away th?re in the dark and I was an
explorer and very bold. So I followed
him, though the dark sort of scared me.
But I got theseâ see?"
The week before Christmas was one
long to be remembered i n Brimstone
Gulch. The oldest Inhabitant could not
recall anything 1^ beat that day when
little Arthur Redmond, as his adopted
father called him. came running out of
Jack's tunnel, shouting with glee and
closely followed by Pard, his constant
companion, now on the verge of a frenzied

the little head cuddled on his shoulder.
"Thank God I didn't blow out my brains
this morning. Thank God I've something

Monte Jim languidly swaggered to Red

by his attitude said: "I'm with you."

"Now then." said Sandy Pete, after
they had done all they could for the
dead, "what's to be done with the boy?
I'm willing to take him. I need a boy
to sweep out the dance house mornings
and run errands. I can make him
useful. Suppose, sonny," with a . fero
cious grin, "you come and live with me?"
The child shrank from him with an
alarmed face. Sandy Pete's visage was
not one to inspire confidence. Monte Jim
glanced at Jack Redmond out of the tail
of his eye. Jack was ominously white,
and there was that unoieasant glitter in
las dark eye that always presaged trou

shortly. "I will take care of him." .

went to the door to conceal his emotions;

all the San Juan Valley, turned to the
window and surreptitiously blew "^hlii

"lie's dead," he said to the others. The
child looked at: them with frightened

"Papa, papa!" he called. "Speak to

He saw at once that the stranger had

"Papa, papa!" said the little boy, run

After breakfast Jack, Sandy Pete,
Tobey Welch and Monte Jim went with
the boy to his home. The ramshackle

finished his writing. The dog obeyed,

on the triggerâ when there came a timid
knock on his door. The dog growled,

sprang toward the door. The miner calmly.

It eoemed the longest clay in the whole
year.
Jeanne busied herself putting away her
ilii broken dolla and toys, hoping to have
their places filled by new ones next day.
Mamma had l;een tÂ» lling about the Christ
mas eves when she was a little girl away
hack Kast. and bow there was snow every
Christmas, and how beautiful it wa.*, until
it Ki'ined to little Jeanne, who had never
feen a snowflake in all her life, that it
oust be the loveliest thing in the world
to live in a place where the enow came
every Christmas. She thought aboui it
iili day. and was still thinking abcut it
â¢ifter the had i.ung up her stockings and
had been tucked into her little bed. Right
In the midst of her thoughts about the
mow she heard a little noise at the win
dow, and lookii.'g up quickly was very
much surprised to see the funniest litt.e
old man Etepptss in at the window. He
was round and fat and had the jolliest.
most good-natured face she had ever
peon. He had a ions white beard and was
ail dressed in fur Ircm head to foot. She
couid not feel afraid of any one who
looked. so good-natured, and as she smiled
ba'k at him he t-jid in the merriest voice.
"Merry Christmas. Jeanne!" As he saiu
this it suddenly flashed upon tier that this
wasâcould it >'c possible?â and yet. whom
else rould it be. lutâ Sa:nt Nicholas?
And then, as if in answtr to her
thoughts, the lolly little old man spoke,
and *aid: '"I iÂ«.m St. Nicholas â otherwise
known as Santa Claus. and when I was
looking over my big book to-day I found
your name- among others who had been
good all the year, and to-night you will re
ceive your reward."
She wondered what the reward was go
in;r to be. but she was not left long to
won-ier. tor St. Xick soon disclosed his
plans. "Come with me." he said; and iÂ£
bt-emed perfectly natural to Jeanr.e }.hat
phe should jump out of bed and a low
herself to tx? completely covered with a
long fur wrap, and littÂ»e fur boots to be
placed on her feet, wondering ail the
while how Santa could have made them
n't so well. "Come to the land of tho
Fnowflaktsâ to the far normâ to the home
of St. Nicholas and his family."
This sounded very delightful to a litte
pin who had always ionged to sec St.
Nick andto pee some "really" snow â ju^st
like that of which rr.amma had toiii her.
So. wuh a inue giggle ot joy anu ex

iolly old man, and together they stepped
:iut of the window. <Sa.nta never useÂ» u

'"oh, ivno ate these lairies?"
asked Jeanne, as a whole troop of
uainty beings came tripping out 01
the house and down the avenue of
stars with outstretched hands and smil
ing laecs.
"\V hy, these are my children, the enow
flake la.Tles," said Santa, and they all
pounced upon him and rairly covered nun
witli kisses, and he then introduced t.j
them this little California girl, who had
never seen a snow flake. It seemed so
strange to them that mere lived a little
girl v. ho had never seen a snowtlaKe. but
thenâ Jeanne reflected: "They had prob
ably never seen a California poppy, with
its beautiful cup of gold." California had
its compensations, after all.
With much fun and laughter Jeanne

looked and tasted and tasted until U
seemed to her that sue musi surely havt;
to stop looKing and tasting soon. But
she diu not, anu the more she looned, and
the more she tasteu. the more she wanted
to look and taste. First, she was la<cen
into the worksnop or' St. Nicholas. This
was the place wnere he wonted all the
year making toys for children, and ail
the long year, when Jeanne was eating
and sleepingâ being good, and sometimes
â sometu.ieh â being l.augnty, nere in this
big, big room, old han't a was working
away with a will.ima.:ing toys or all de
scriptions.
On. the lovely bicycles and tricyclps!
Just what she had said In the notes that
she l.au written Sama that very nay.
fclie uid want a tricycle, oh, .Â« j badly.
ar:d she had aiso said in the note that
phe would like a big doll, all cresseu Â»<i
pink t-ilk â it he coulu spare it. And now.
\vhÂ«-n her eyes fell upon the shelve? and
shelves of b:g dolls with pinK Bil* dresses,
her hopes rose, and. she felt sure he woui.l
he able to spare one for her. Uui Jeanne
was not the only good child who was
visiting St. Nicholas that Christmas eve.
There were many, many others, and some
of them were little poor children, sj poor
...at they had never Jcnown what it was
to have enough to eat. and some of them
had no kind papas and- mammas and no
soft, warm bed, and no pretty dresses,
but hat. always been cold and ragged
and miserable. Instead of the tender lave
of a mother they had been beaten, and
instead of Kind words the" had naa cruel
ones. When Jeanne saw these children
and realized It all, she tnousnt h-nv many
pood things there were in her own lire.
and she made up her mind that after this
the would go out into the wnrlÂ«J a;i I
hunt up these poor things, and help them
all she could; and she went over and
whiFpereu to St. Nicholas and told him
that she had changed her mind, and that
If it was just the Fame to him, would
he please give the doll and the tricycle
to the poor children instead of to her?
He smiled in his peculiar way and said:
"We shall fee, little one. Who knows
but I may have enorjrh for aM?"
Jeanne's heart fe| lighter after she had
told him rt her wish, and It ne^mfd to
her that after all there was more pleasure
â¢ In glvimr to others than there was in I
getting all the pretty things one's self.
There were big groves of Christmas
trees of all p!ze?. and Santa had scores
of tiny men cutting them off. all ready to
take to the homes all over the world
Then there were proves of oranpo trees
and apple tre*sâ trees full of nuts and
vines full of raisins. Just then she saw
wme queer looking mountains in the d'*
tanceâsome were red and some were
white and some were all covered with
stripes. What could they be?
She determined to find out for herself,
for she hated to be all the time asking
Questions about the snowflake fairies. But
they saw Jeanne gazing at these peculiar
mountains, and there was a great deal of
tittering and giggling among these tiny
folks. As they came nearer the moun
tain Jeanne detected an odor of pepper
mint In the air, and she exclaimed: "Oh.
ran It be? Yes. It Isâ It isâ candy! Just
think! big mountains made of candy!"
The first mountain was made of pep
permint candy, and there were millions of
candy walklng-st'cks growing on this
mountain. Then there were jhountalns or
taffy and chocolate creams, and taffy and
baby creams, and such soft, white moun
tains of marshmallows. Jeanne really
thought she liked the candv mountains
better than anvth'ng she had seen. Some
way they appealed to her. She kept tak
ing bites from the different mountains,
and each one tasted better than thf last.
Soon she came to such a white, rough
looking, mountain, and couldn't Imagine
what made it look so funny until she got
real close to It and found it was a moun
tain of popcorn ha'ls. At each one of the
mour.talrs there were score? of these tiny
men filling ral'lnns and miiltr.ns <>f tiny
baps and entnucopa* with the different
kindsof cardy.^irtl thoy werÂ«Â» all- srÂ» Jolly
over the'r work That it made Jeanne lau^h
to hear thorn.
On* of Â»h.-* snowflnke fa'rles said to
Jranne: "H^v yon ever been coasting?"
"Why no." sa'.d Jeanne, "what is coast-
Ing?"
'Tome and you shall see." they replied.
And she ran with them to a Mg mountain
all covered with snow, and they put her
In a-tir.y sled and gave her a push, till
('ownâdownâ she went, f.tstcr than light
ning, until. laughing and squeaMrg. she
'landed nt the bottom of the mountain
wlih such force that she tniib'ed-out. and
Just rolled In the soft, featherv snow un

Ch trlÂ» wa j Â£tm Indeed. J anne thought
she would like to do this always aid al
ways, and only change about by nibbling
on the randy mountains between slides.
She rolled and tumL.ed about In the snow
until her cheek3 were as red aÂ«= a rose,
and all the time no one said. "You'll get
vrur feet wtt." Anyway, she had on the
deareÂ«t MttJe wh'te fur slippers which
Mamma St. Nkho'aM had given her when
she first came and a whole warm suit of
white fur. until sho reminded herself very
much of a spitz dog.
After a long, long night spent in fun
sii.d frolic and feasting Jeanne again
heard the tinkle, of the slelghbellrf.
and jolly old 9t. Nicholas appeared

something, but th*Â» fur robes were over
Jt and she could not see very well,
and once she thought she saw part or a
little tricycle wheel sticking out from un
der the seat, and caught a glimpse a*
something pink, but she kept ber own
counsel and didn't nay anything about It.
She knew she would find out when Christ
mas morning came, anyway: and it was
almost Christmas morning now. 'â¢ Â¦ â¢Â¦
She thought she would like to take a
nice big star to her mamma for & Christ
mas gift, so she picked a nice large onÂ©
and held It very carefully all the way.
After a while the air grew warmer.
"Why. there are no more snownakes.
she said. "No." said Santa, "we have
left the land of the snowflakes now and
are once more In the land of popples.
Then little Jeanne looked down upon the
fragrant fields and saw the beautiful
satin popples, with their cups of gold, and
said with a happy sigh: "After all. It la
beautiful in Californiaâ the land where It
is always summer."
Soon they arrived at Jeanne's home, ana
Sant.i left his sleigh and reindeer in the
top of a high tree this time, so he would
not wake mamma with the tinkling of the
bells. He put Jeanne in at the window,
while she hugged to her breast the b!g
star for mamma, and then away he went,
while she crept into her little soft bed
and did not awaken until she felt a warm
ki?s and heard mamma say, "Merry
Christmas. Jeanne." Then she remem
bered the star and looked on the chair
where she had placed It. bat It was cone,
an3 she could not find It gnywhera. She
felt dreadfully over It. Mamma
"Why, Jeanne, what are you looking
for?" "I am looking for a beautiful star,
said she. "that I p'.cked out of the sky
my very own self, just for you. mamma-
Then mamma hupged her tightly and
said: "Never mind the star., dear; your
two bright eyes will be mamma's Christ
mas stars. Come now and let's- see what
Santa Claus has brought you."
Oh. my. how excited .Jeanne did feel
then and how she hurried downstairs and
opened the door, and there in the middle
of the roomâ what do you suppose she
sawÂ° The dearest little ChTlstmas tree,
all sparkles and light, and what could
that be on the very top?â something pink,
with yellow curls and blue eyes. \vny.
vesâ It must beâ it isâ the very doll she
had seen in her visit to the fairies, and
she soon had it hugged tightly to her
breast and was showering kisses upon It
at a terrible rate. "I shall name her
. Snowflake."" she said.
And now what i? that shiny thing peep-
Ing from behind the tree? It seemed al
most too good to be true, but it wasâ it
really wasâ that tricycle, and on the tree
Were" samples of all the candy and nuta
and some of all the pood things she had
seen in the home of St. Nicholas. So
Jeanne knew by that that it could not
have been a dream, but a "truly visit.
So after she had looked at all the beauti
ful things and had eaten such a nice
Christmas breakfast, she sat down and
told mamma all about it.
Mamma was very much surprised, or
coarse, but thought it the loveliest thing
she had ever heard.
That night when Jeanne looked up at
the sky she saw a beautiful bright star
that looked so like the one she had lost
that she recognized it In- a minute, ana
said. "Oh. mamma, there is your star."
and mamma smiled and said: "Let it
Â«hine on where It isâ the beautiful Christ
mas star. Perhaps the little baby starÂ»
need it worse than we."
And Jeanne was content.

taJye a little trouble to look our best in
one another's eyes, the eyes In which wa
care most to be attractive?"
Marjorie leaned trustfully against his
shoulder.
His next step would hav* puzzled a
spectator not endo^ved with the story tell
er's gift of seeing into the machinery of
the human skull. He arrayed himself
carefully In even'ng dress, stealing a rose
from the bouquet In his wife's sittlnjr
room for his button hole. Then hÂ» ran
lightly downstairs as a lover to a tryst.
Alison was still in the easy chair. Mar
jorie had not left the piano.
"Good evening." said Basil, debonairly,
to the guest, bowlnrr as he passed her on
the way to his wife, who had risen with
a low cry of surprise and confusion.
He took her in his arms, careless of
other eyes.
Throoch all the years
Together you and I!
he said. "The years we are to spend here,
darling. We won't wait for eternity."
In releasing herself from thÂ© Ions' em
brace Marjorie turned a flushed, happy
face toward Alison's corner. It was va
cant.
"You stark, conceited, blithering Idiot!"
he hissed between his teeth. "If I could
find a place to stand upon I would knocfc
you down and pummel you to a Jelly, you
asinine, infernal mistake In the shape oÂ£ a
man!"
The eavesdropper got himself away
without noise, the thick stair carpet fa
voring his retreat. WTÂ»en safe in his
dressing-room he marched up to a mirror
and shook a ravage fist at the image re
flected therein. '. .'/â¢â¢
"It goes more than well. I am ashamed
of you for neglecting your practicing. You
always undervalued your musical talents
and every other kind. Have you ever
sung that to Basil?"
."Xever! He Is too good a judge of mu
sic to care for such shallow stuff. Basil
is not sentimental. I ani afraid I shall be
always."
"You ought to t>f glad instead of afraid.
Sentiment is the sugar In the sherbet of
daily living. You are unjust to Basil as
well as to yourself In pretending to be
what you are not. and. please heaven,
what you can never be."
-I found the words In Lrpplncott's Mag
axlne. They are by John Leigbton Best.
Aa for the music, if you call it music, I
thought it out for myself." She swting
around on the piano stool with a nervous
llttlo laugh. "As I told you. I have not
kept up my practicing. It didn't seem
worth while somehow. But after baby
cameâ and wentâ I fell into a way of com
ing down here In the evenings when Basil
was out. and strumming 1 and humming to
myself to keep off loneliness and the blue
devils. That scrap of verse haunted me
until I fitted It to a tune. It isn't much
of a tune, but it goes well with the
words."
"The price of husbandly admiration' is
perpetual prettiness," lumlnated wise All-'
son, staring the moon cut of countenance
through her chamber window at the eerie
hour of two in the morning. "Marjorie
has gone off In style rather than in face.
Her gown is two years behind the fash-
Ion, and her hair as plainly dressed as if
she were her own maiden aunt. While
we were talking she seemed intent upon
her crocheting. Basil used to hate the
sight of a crochet-needle. He doesn't
seem to mind it now: but he ought to.
He has grown away from her. and that
with a married man or woman Is a sin
and a danger. They needed nobody to.
as she had been upon entertaining the
lover. The knowledge that Basil was hers
to have and to hold for life may have
filled her soul to the exclusion of all
thoughts of his possible truancy. What
.a woman hath doth she yet hope for?
Basil had got used to the idea of absolute
possession and what It implies before the
honeymoon reached its fourth quarter.
By the beginning of the fourth year or
married monotony and conjugal certainty
It was such an old story that he yawnea
when obliged to con it. He loved his
wife still, deeply and truly. He was no
longer in love with her. The difference
is in the degree, not In kind; In shade, and
not in color. Some women content them
selves with the second grade and affect
to admire the faded tint. Others go hun
gering and thirsting to their gravesâ or to
ruin.
Clear-eyed Alison came to the silent
conclusion during that evening of obser
vation that a more potent domestic decoy
Â¦would have been a wife as zealously and
tactfully bent upon holding her husband
Marjorie had reasoned herself into the
conviction that, if the baby born to them
three years ago had lived Instead of pass-
Ing to heaven upon the first breath It
Grew In this bleak world, home would
have been more and club life less to the
baby's father.
Basil, on his part, considered the whole
loaf his due by every natural and pur
chased right, and meant to have it in
come shapeâ or its full equivalent.
The mated pair who had made a love
. match were disillusioned. As often hap
pens In such disasters, the woman was
more inclined to adjust herself to the
changed relations than the man. Femi
nine regard for appearances has more to
do with this submissive attitude than
philosophy. Marjorie had pared her half
loaf into such semblance of the goodly
-whole she had bargained for as might de
celve the outside world. She went so far
sometimes as to try to make believe to
herself that she was almost content with
It. Anything was better than to*face the
truth that her husband was disappointed
In her and dissatisfied with the lot Into
â¢which his marriage with her bad brought
him. No strange thing had happened to
her. Other wives were in the same caseâ
worse.
Before the first evening at home was
over, Alison Stirling read, as In a book
Â¦which had been so rudely handled that it
would fall open at a touch, what had hap
pened while she was away, and what
might happen now she was here.
Marjorie caught the tone, but not th*>
Â¦words. Ah. well! What difference did it
make what he said or thought? It is an
evil sign when a wife can Fay that even
Jn part earnest. When she has learnoU
the formula by heart In less than four
years of married experience, it Is a very
evil sign indeed.
Basil shrugged his shapely shoulders
"That's the woman of it!" he muttered
In the mustache he pulled petulantly over
his mouth.
"And what a ravishing Parisian toilet!"
said Marjorie lightly, swallowing the knot
In her threat and ashamed to lift her
handkerchief to clear her eyes of the mist
that showed her Alison as the nucleus of
a prismatic halo.
"She has grown handsome!" remarked
Basil to his wife, as Alison pressed for
â¢ward to the guards to wave her hand In
reply to the toss of his hat.
BÂ£- c :l and Marjorie were at the wharf to
meet her. His commanding figurecaught
the traveler's eye as soon as she could dis
tinguish men from women In the waiting
crowd. There was not another like him
there (or anywhere), she said to her Heart;
quiet because deep.
On the 15th of the same monthâ before
the newly made husband and wife re
turned from thÂ« wedding tourâ Alison
called for Southampton In company with
friends who had proposed the trip and
urged her to join them. Her auntâ the
nearest relative she had in the world
died six months later. Alison remained
over seas three years and a half longer.
There was nothing to call her back to
America now that Marjorie was settled
In a home of her very own and dependent
lipcn nobody except her husband for hap
piness. It was as natural as her lingering
nil those years where there was so much
to see and to study, that, when she turned
her face homeward, it was with the In
tention of taking up her abode, for a
While at least, in her cousin's house.
Alison had a high spirit, but a steady
head. The unusual combination carried
her well through the chagrinâ if chagrin
there woreâ cf the discovery; through the
difficult duties of confidante to both
parties to the betrothal, and of bridesmaid
at the wedding, which took place the first
week of June, 1SS0.
In saying that the match took nobody
by surprise, I might have mentioned that
there was a time when Alison Stirling had
not Quite expected this outcome of Basil's
friendly visits to the house of the aunt,
Marjorie's mother, with whom Alison had
lived since the death of her two parents.
Basil was her particular friend at the
first, and wes so esteemed by her until she
discovered that, in the absent-minded

blushing. "She lectured me roundly, too,

like a tonic, a pleasant sort of bitter that

wasn't listening for you. Alison is a veri

been a blind, blundering ass! Only that
and nothing more. You'll give me an

save by the electric lamps In the street

window, faint and tiny by reason of the
lower glare. The stanch heart stirred un
easily In the effort to ignore the ache very
far down. She would not ask herself if,
among the myriads of souls quick with
life and feeling in tne mighty city under
her eyes, there were many lonelier than
ehe to-night.
"This Is but the beginning," she said
aloud and resolutely. "A good beginning,
but that Is all."-
She sank suddenly to her kneea. The
restless heart broke bounds:
"God bless them!" she cried, in a pas
sion of love and longing. "God bless tnem
and help me to hold fast to the right, to

over her face. "There is dire need 'of s
match-mender now. I don't like the look
of it all!"
When Alison did not like anything, and
said as much in that tone., a .sharp-cut
plait between her brows and a straighten
ing out of the bowed upper lip, something
or somebody had to give way.
The next day closed In wet and wild.
As Basil Lanneau swung himself from the
cable car at the corner nearest his house
he. had about made up his mind to look
in at the club that night. He would find
no better entertainment there. than Allsoa
Stirling's conversation. He had always
liked and admired her, but travel, study
and experience of the world had made a
fascinating woman of her. There wa3
stimulusâ inspirationâ to a man. in . such
companionship. She had introduced
leaven into the inert uieal of his domestic
life. - \
The sound of music flowed Into the
rainy darkness as he opened the front
door. He moved softly in, laying aside
overcoat and hat, - then paused, unheard,
to study the picture framed v- the por
tiere hung between drawing-room and
hall. ,
Alison Stirling sat at the glowing grate
of the back room, halfrburletl in the cush
ions of a'Turkish chair. Her face, seen in
profile, was pensive; her simple black silk
gown made her look pale, almost plain.
In fact. Who, then, was tne musiciun?
He shifted his position, bringing into eye
range piano and performer. The tail,
pink-shaded lamp beside her showed him
the girl he had wooed 'and won five years
before. He had almost forgotten how she
boked, and the sudden apparition dazea
him. Involuntarily he shut hia eyes hard,
then opened them, incredulous of their re
port. It was Marjorie Donne to. the, life!
Dream-love, sweetheart, and bride!. Her
gray .brocade was cut sauare and low
upon the chest; the opening^ was. filled
with creamy lace. A great red rose
nestled, among the billowing flufllness.
Her hair waved and rippled back from the
broad, low forehead. He could have sala
that her, cheeks were rounded by the flu3h
that restored the delicate tint of her com
plexlon. While he looked she beean to
sing. Her voice waa a contralto J of fair
quality; to-night It waa tender and sym-
pathetic. She articulated purely and dla
tlnotly.
Silence, and then the dark:
Sweet sleep, and then the dawn.
And one star there to mark
Where thou hast cone.
So, Bweetheart, from my slant
A little hast thou flown;
Why, for the absence of a night
Should I make moan?
Parted, but not with tears:
Earth's dream and then the sky.

THp SUNDAY CALL.In such grand poetry as this, a hymn of
five verses of seven lines each, both Ro
man Catholics and evangelical Christians
can Join at Christmas time.
Christmas eve is a family festival where"
old and young of three or f<Jur genera
tions meet at a supper of fish, eels, nut*.
cakes and fruit or vegetables. No meat
Is permitted, as this Is what Is called eat
ing magro, but it is none the less a full
meal. It Is followed next day by the
sumptuous dinner, graced necessarily by
a fat capon and ended by pan glallo, a sort
of coarse nut and fruit cake. Roman chll
dren receive no gifts on Christmas day.
They have no legendary Santa Claus with
snow-covered caps and - furs and belli
who comes down the chimney to fill theh
stockings with long desired gifts.
Their Ideal is La Befano, an ugly but
very 'benevolent old woman who brings
them dolls, -trumpets, little watches,
eweets and marbles, on the night before
Epiphany. As the wise men of the East
brought gold, frankincense and myrrh as
Sifts to the Madonna and the Child, the
Romans consider that Epiphany Is the
time to give gifts. Instead of Christmas.
This Is a materialistic view of th^beauti
ful custom, very different from that of
the Protestant church, which selects
Christmas day for its observance. Gifts
to each other are tokens of Joy for the
Inestimable gift which God in his ten
ider love toward mankind gave that da>
In Bethlehem.
The people who 'serve you at home, the
baker, the milkman, the grocer, the wash
woman, the carpet-beaters, the postman,
etc., are willing to receive their' mancls,
a small gift In money, on Christinas day.
They expect it then, and figuratively ono
holds "a regular levee,, purse in hand, ; un
til the procession Is ended.

strength. Mo s'gn of this coming:, change
is so clear to the wise observer aa the dif
ferent ways of celebrating Christmas. The
old way uses Images;' the new one' does
not. And the presepio and the Christmas
tree are emblematic V the two systems of
religion which row, after the lapse of cen
turies, -meet in the so-called Eternal City.
The presepio is a reproduction of the
stable of Bethlehem where Jesus Christ
was born. There In a rocky cavern are
â¢"â¢ax Images, often as large as life, of the
Virgin Mother and the. Child, of Joseph,
the shepherds and the magi, while other
Images of placid cows and wise donkeys,
the natural Inhabitants of the stable, fill
up the scene.
The Christmas tree has no Images, not
even the Gorman Christ-child on the top;
but Its green, aromatic branches are
laden with yellow oranges, with silver
balls and strings of fjilt paper, with light
ed candles. r"d. white and green, the col
ors of Italy, and. with flakes of mimic
â¢now. The Sunday schools of the evan
gelical churches In Rome generally have
a Christmas tree, not only beautiful to
see, but laden with gifts that make the
hearts of the little ones sing for joy. N'ear
ly all of the Roman Catholic churches
have a presepio, but the most splendid is
that of the Church of Ara Colll. on the
historic Campldoglio. There the Madon
na holds in her lap the wondrous bambino
rGesu, a dark complexloned wooden doll
dressed in gold and silver tissue stuff and
covered from head to foot with precious
stones. It Is believed by the populace to
possess miraculous healing power, nnd Is
often carried in a grand carriage to the
sick. The presepio Is on the left of the en
trance after you climb the long, long stone
staircase that leads up the hill; on the
right at Christmas time is seen a plat
form where children recite hymns and
other poems to the great delight of the!r
respective mothers, aunts, sisters and
grandmothers.
Wherever In the smaller churches there
Is a modest presepio the mothers gather
and urge their little ones to recite their'
hymns of praise to the Madonna and the
child. But to the divine child alone are
the hymns and songs addressed which are
repeated by- the children around the
Christmas tree.-
Some time in Christmas week, not al
ways on Christmas eve, these visions of
light and beauty entrance the children In
the Waldensian. the Methodist, the Bap
tist and the other Italian evangelical
churches. And not only the children but
the mothers and fathers. come to cele
brate the "Peace on earth, good will to
men." Love and Joy touch the hearts of
young and old. Then Is sung the beauti
ful hymn written by Alessandro Man
soni, set to a melody even more beautiful
than the words, sung by the martyrs and
confessors of the persecuted churches

place by my. bodstde. nnd ns she proved
ill-temptredly taciturn I learned nothlnsr

to go out and take. up the burden of ex
istence among my ' new comrades.
"I will tell you," she said. "You are

Her slender hand, cool and softly
smooth as a magrnolln petal, pressed me
gently- bade 'on the pillows?.
"Tell 'me everything," I demanded, an
overmastering desire to know th,e worst
givinc me strength to throw off the blan
kets and raise myself on one arm, "or I
will co and find out for myself. 'Where

my right to know, and J will!"
A great pity shone suddenly in her
eyes. "Then you "are both fortunate and

& Mb> for a mrraent, the horror of the
â¢f-tll. the smothering embrace of

cut through the darkness seemed but the

The realization that I was that strug

to me only when my hand? beat the air.

Kred's foar-bleached faco among the line
of heads bent over the rail on which I
had loungoo whil* we two. looking over
at Goat Islands looming shadow, talked
idly of the Christmas eve dinner fr'oni
which w? were returning.
How hopelessly remote ell the light and
life and movement up there pboyf mo
seemed! T heard confused :Â¦ fronts and
cries; the stamping rush of hunyirg feet.
and the harsh clank and ratti.* of un
winding chains as a beat was rapidly low
ered from its davits.
I felt that they would not be In time*.
Something war, strangely wrons. for. ex

seemed paralyzed. .There 'Â¦jxi's a heavy,
buzzing, aching: roar In my hea.l. . I had
already sunk twice. Something dragge.-i
on my ffvt. and I hesar. to cry. like, an
overtired child, Fobbing with a bubbling'
outgoing of the little breath that was left
in meâ it was such a pitiful thing to
drown there, like a blind puppy, when 1
had so much to live forâ so many plans
ahead of me;
I tried to call out. to ralsomy stiffened
arms, but the weight at my fret, grew
heavier, the roar In my ears grew deafen

My opening eyes, were assailed by a
Clare of white'light so strons- that for the
moment they wero forced shui.^agatrr.
Then I raised my lids and looked, througn
"a framing circle . of unfamiliar ; faces,
straight up into a black dome, fringed
with parallel lines of glittering siars.
I could feel the clinging leaden v> thrss
of my. garments all about me: but there
was a pleasant, diffusing heat some iere
near the center of- my body,, mid rry
mustache sir.elled revivingly of brandy..

to sleep, but as I closed my eyes I was
shaiteti sharply by the shoulder and drag
ged up into a sitting position. My back
was resting against a hard and unsympa
thetic masculine knee.
"Come,'" said an impatient voice. "Have
you changed your, mint! or not? You've
got another chanceâ do you want It?"
I stared about me curiously, anil saw
that I was surrounded by a group -if
[Tome twenty-five persons, tour or fivÂ»> of
whom wure women. From a craterliko,
hole near my fett came the alternating
dash and seething gurgle of up-crawling
water, and I shivered aa I heard it.
The man who was knetling and holding
brandy to my lips | looked â¢ dewn at me
v.'lth 'half-scornful compassion.
"Will you take the oath and be one of
us?" he demanded. "Or will you go buck
there?" and he pointed to the; pli wlt'.i an
outflung hand that wcmej.to my shaker,
aoul to be quivering with menace.
All the torturing agony of my drowning

chrank and cowered and caught at hla
arm in a paroxyism of abject terror.
."Let m<? live: let me live!" I - begged.
"I can endure anything but thatâ again :"
Wher. I awoke once more, I lay dry and
warm and languidly content in a nost of
soft and fleecy blankets. The star
encircled dome still looked down upon me.

unaware of my return to consciousness. I
decld-d that she would s have been very

queer and irresponsible and there was a

"It Is because most of the men" tried to

explained Helen, when I found opportu
nity to ask her. "and the women gener
ally have some grudge against a man
even Kate's husband used to beat her â
and they have brought their memories
with them."
"And you?" I asked the question half
fearfully. for this girl had attracted mo

to hear her story.
She met my eyes frankly. "My mother

When I next ppfke to Helen, after set

burning brush with no thought for any
other thing or place. After a while Jo
stopped to wipe the sweat and sreeka
from his eyes and exclaimed:
yet. in the understanding of each other,
were a continent apart Only Martha
seemed to know, and Hal was learning.
As soon as all wero Inside and busy he
hurried out. tossed the brush aside and
whispered. "Quick! Cut for the ditch!"
The Indian crept to the corner of the
house, then sprang to h!3 feet and away,
apparently as s-wlftly and as easily as a
coyote, while Hal. standing with his back
to the closed door, on one pretaxt or an
other, kept both the dancers and their ns
itora from passing-. Bat another danger
startled even him. In hrs haste to Creo
the Indian he had thrown ths sage top*
too near the fire, which had reached out
hungrily and dtvoured them and waa
climbing- up the great pile beside theÂ»
house. The light shone far out across tne
valley, and as the door was Cung open,
two rifle shots that were as one In soxmd
sent leaden vengeance to overtake tta vic

toward the ditch. Then hÂ« disappeared:

their tribe to take his life.

"Lady in the center and all hands

"Lady, o* course!" she answered Indig
nantly. Â¦ ,
Martha, looking and listening, amused
with' the cddlty of it all. felt a sudden
chill and' put out her hand to close the
Bide door near, which was standing partly
open, but some object prevented. Before
she could meve to learn what, the obstruc
tion was out of the crack and inside. She
could hear It. could feel it wriggling along
the floor, even pressing her feet forward
to get more room. ' It was > surely not a
pig. for It was apparently trying to be
quiet. She might nave screamed, though
Martha was not a screaming woman, but
u hand -grasped her ankle and a hiss of
warning ceme from the creeping creature.
Then she almost laughed at herself. Of
course It was only young Jake Schnieder.
the scamp! at seme trick. Well, he might
have his fun; she wouldn't spoil it.
Ihe swinging couple3 Jarred the floor
till the stovepipe chattered in its place in
the roof and threatened to fall. "Put It
cut. put it out!" went around the room.
Directly the stove was outside, the fire
poured on the frozen ground . and piled
with sage lops till the flames went crack
ling high in air.
Martha never dancod. so she sat and
watched the flrr. thinking, thinking, see
ing strange visions In the wavering, sway
Â¦ Ing, vaulting flame and smoke. She seem
ed to see faces, dark, intent, vengeful,
pc-ering at her from tho quivering heat.
They came and went and came again,
lifted high or dropped low 'and moved
stealthily nearer and nearer to the door.
They were children of the fire. thÂ«e faces
of her waking dream, for they glowed
darkly red, and two were . hideous with
blackened cheeks and forehead. They
scemrdâ pshaw! what was wrong with her
that she should have such notions? She
would think of something else, of Jakey
and his mischief. What d!d he mean to
do? She glanced at the space between
overhanging shawls near which he had
i-topped moving, and 'there, for one In
etan . f lay a red-brown hand closed about
the hilt of a hunting knife. Ah, then
those were realâ not dream faces that had
shone out from the fire. .
Hal was still singing:

"Say." grumbled Hunchy. "who is caller

"EUire, an" It's glnerally sahposed to bÂ«
Hal's voice sounded above it all as he
shouted. "Vamose! Clear out! Shoo!
Git! It's supper time. Where's the water
bucket. Bob? Rake out the coals, some
body, and find the coffee pot. Where's
the table extension? Jo. take care of
Maggie; Cap'n Dean and I work behind
closed doors for a Bpeii. Now. then, what
next?" He had locked the door and stood
waiting, with the serious question in eyes
as well as voice.
"The Piute doctor is ln'here. The next
thing la to save him if we can." Hal
opened his eyes wide, th/n nodded and
laid his finger on his lip. She knelt by the
shawl-draped bench and a few swift
words passed between her and the unseen
fugitive. Then she went outside, while
Hal. obeying orders, rolled In the empty
barrels. set one in the middle of the room
and another near each end and lifted to
their place the two long boards that were
to, eerve as table. . Â¦
Jo was doing gloriously. Martha said,
and she, too. laughed and Joked . even
tried to sing, but tha words that would
come were "far. far away"; and she
stopped, shivered/and complained of the
driugbt between the house and the sage
pile. "Let's fill it in," sne suggested. A
barricade of brush was quickly raised and
approved; then she went In after charging
them not to let the coffee boll over.
Hal had spread the tablecloths and was
openln? bundles, boxes and baskets. Mar

Jo followed his lead, with his sleeves
rolled up. head - thrown back and f e*t
stamping the lively tune, but all the while
he was wondering what in time Marthy

THE SUNDAY CAJLL.
"There. I've spoiled the fence." she ex
claimed. "Never mind, the coffee is done
and supper is ready. Walt!" â to- the
Plutes, who were getting restlessâ "you
shall have some, too."
They hesitated, went inside and all
around the house,' even groped among the
sleepy swine, and. though still unsatisfied,
waited. And so. in the light of the burn
ing sage, fragments of two races filled
their cups from the same coffee-pot and
took bread from. the pvop |ta .plat*, *fid
tha carefully unfastened the ?lde door and
looked out; No one was there, and the
new wall cast a deep shadow past the cor
ner of the hoube. She stepped to where
the Indian lay and walked slowly before
the bench while he wriggled backward
out through the door and close to that
thin wall between him and death, then lay
there, face down and very still, while
Martha, closing the door softly,' answered
Hal'B cheerful nonsense, though her hands
trembled and her voice sometimes shook.
Then, going out again, she leaned care
lessly against the loosely piled sage till it
toppled over in a tumbled. Irregular, heap
beyond. Not a sound came from the
buried Indian. " *r**iHTI mt "flW
every good, to enjoy a little as If it had
been much, and how hearty In their wel
comesâyet how quick In their resent
ments! The rumble of wheels grew faint
er In the several dl3tance3. then stopped
entirely, and all the world beyond them
selves was still. Then Martha, told, her
story, with Marjory sleeping in her arms
and Jo listening in amazement and with,
many interruptions of "I swan!" "By the
Lord Harry!" and the like, ending with,
"Wa-all. Martha.; you do beat the Dutch,
an* no mistake."
At the touch of the cold pillow of her
little bed Marjory's eyes flew open with a
startled, pleading look- in their brae shad
ows.
"Mamma." she demanded, "te'.l me-!
What did God want Big Dolly tor?
Couldn't he find some other Christmas
present? I saw him. np there: no. Idess
I dreamed it." she added sleepily, and nes
tled down again. D!d she dream it?
Martha Â«at and watched the child,
thinking of the sorrowing Indian mother
and of that other Mary through whose
motherhood the nations were to draw to
rether. to contend often, to ualte some
times, but to truly harmonizeâ when?
"I guns," remarked Jo thoughtfully,
"if we went by such a rule there'd be
more graves o' doctors an.' not so many
o* their patients."
And so the Christmas morclng came,
with all the Joys: sorrows, the uncertain
ties of all the other days that have been
and that are to be.

"Yis. Darlint; I'll, be afther lettin'lt go '

As he bent to set Marjorie In her lap.
Martha-spoke close to his -car. "Don't
look. There are Plutes outside. What do
they want?" :â¢ -"
"Don't know," he answered; "I'll find
out." He was soon back with his report,
which was that Mary's kid had gone up
the shaft and : the families were aft
.'er the doctor's scalp; that it was the third
Piute he had let go out of his hands to
the happy hunting grounds, or some other
place, and he must take the consequences;
also that they had tracked him to Bob's
cabin. Â¦ : ; â¢ .
Martha thought hard for one swift in
stant. "Hal!" He stood at attention. "At
the end of. thin dance get them all out and
help me set the table." He saluted and
turned as Hunchy shouted. "Swing with
yer partners and all promenade!"-^n thtÂ»
hubbub that followed Martha went to Jo.

Martha gently swung aside the blanket
from Mary's doorway and went in. The
baby had scarcely noticed any one since
morning-, and the' Indian mother looked
up with dull, heavy eyes, â¢ but. made no
answer to their words of sympathy, and
helpful offers, except that as-they left
her fad gaze followed the little fair-haired
girl who loved her baby bo, , and cooed
over him and fold him to. "be well to-mor

I It was drearily cold in there where Mary
crouched in the straw with ' her moaning
baby. In the straw! Was It this Mary or
the other whose child lay among heaps of
straw who was so happyâ no, so exceed

When they reached Bob Sanders* cabin
the company, sixteen besides themselves
and not Inoladlng- the children; had* all
come and, were waiting, for the fiddler,

that they had not heard of the party; but
the bricks for. their feet were already hot
on the stove.- the heavy blanket* hung by
the fire and Jo was spreading a big arm
ful of hay In the wagon bed. Still she
stood there thinking.
She remembered their last Christmas eve
In dear old Vermont, where when it was
cold there was snow enough for sleighing,
and there were relatives and friends to
meet: and, too, there was a little grave
that belonged to them in those far-away
restful hills. Martha was glad, as i"
thought of it. that it was there, and not
here. How lonely it seemed: Nothing
moved as far as she could see, and that
was for miles.
-Mamma," aÂ«Â»ked wee Marjory, softly
laying her rheek against the tired hand
that hung by her mother's eide. "Mam
ma, Is you lonesome?"
Martha locked at the child wonderingly,
then quickly smiled away the transient
sadness and ' prepared for the long, coM
ride.
"Jo" she said, as they crossed the
frozen ditch, "1 want to go round by the
Rar.cherle to see how Big Dolly Is. I
heard that he was sick."
"All right," answered Jo. turning the
horses' heads. Bless him! Everything was
always all right with him.
The "Rancherle" was a cluster of tule-t
thatched huts on a *jmdy ridge not far;
from the river and occupied by a small
band of Piute Indians, n part of the seven
or eight hundred allotud to the reserva
tion at the lake. As. tribal communism
had not proved very i.rofltable to the
minorttv who were gla<i to work, some of
these preferred spending -their . time ail
together, helping in the house or fields,
dressing much like their white compan

dren deserve no present, and that they
can only expect such if they are good

parts of Germany the figure bears an
other name. Something of that kind is
known in almost all parts of Germanyâ
but it is more in old tradition, as some
thing actually done everywhere. ,: - Â¦;Â¦-.
The Christmas presents are perhaps tha
principal feature of German Chrlstia&a.
It is they which In the mind of every
child raiso the 21th of December beyond
all other dates in the year. The oldest
man or woman will never forget the thrill
of joyful excitement, when the father rings
the bell, the doors are thrown open and
the children are admitted into what seems
to them Hke paradise. They find not only
the adorned and lighted Christmas treÂ«
bvt each one of them a table spread for
him. Before Christmas everybody In the
house has his secrets. -Now these secrets
are being revealed and the children hasten
to their different tables, curious to see
whether their hopes and wishes have been
lea'ized. But the"Â»e tables are not limited
to the children. Christmas Is a home fes
tival in the fullest sense of the word. Not
enly the family in the sense proper but
the whole house meets under the Christ
mas tree. For each of the servants there
Is also a table of Christmas boxes. Some
times the servants prefer receiv
ing money, tut even then small
gifts, a good almanac, some apples and,
gingsrfcread are added, so that the table
may not s;*em empty. In houses without
distinct religious feeling the presents are
simply siver. â In Christian families the
children generally recite Christian hymns,
the old and ever new gospel. Luke 11:1-14
is read, the father adds a few words and
in prayer the whole household stands be
fore God.
It cannot he denied that the universal
exchange of presents has many draw
backs. It makes the vreeks preceding
Christmas a time cf very hard work. In
the stores work goes on till late at night.
On the fourth Sunday in Advent churches
are generally empty in Germany, aa
everybody is far too busy with the prep
arations. Much money la spent and
earned. It !s for many parents a hard
tax. fcr those who earn in business and
who receive gifts a temptation to forget
the gi\er over the gift. The poor are apt
to look forward to presents, and to get
thereby greerl of. money. For all those
who have to give it Is a time of hard
/work. Thoughts must be kept together
' so that nobody and nothing may be for
gotten. Therefore somebody recently said
with a kind of truth: "Many arrive at
Christmas with empty purses and empty
hearts." But notwithstanding all these
abuses, who would like to abolish the
presents at Christmas? Christmas cele
brate* the great gift .of God to mankind.
It ir the feast of love. Therefore every
body must t-how love to all around them.
Parents show this love to their children,
masters to their servantsâ but in their
turn the children like to bring their
parents seme gift of their own making,
nnd also brothers nnd sisters have some
thing for each other. Charitable people
Invite poor families ot^bring presents to
their hcmc3. Poor peopre who are looked
after by the churches expect something
at Christmas. Kvery body is to be made
happy! Even in the Sunday schools It is
Impossible to let the children go without
a Christmas gift. Large presents axÂ» not
given, so as not to attract them by earthly
means, but a small picture, a calendar, a
book or something of the kind shows the
children that they are recipients of God's
rood things. With Christ Joy and happt
- ness came Into the world. If his birth is
celebrated it must be done in a way that
it is indeed a period of great Joy. And
such It is in Germany, especially for chil
/dren. but also for such who share tha
joy of their children and feel young again
in them, and tlnally also for those who
live in the memory ol a happy childhood.
Â«7rp 8 the Christmas season again
// \\ draw* r.igh our thoughts are nat-
Jf Â» tirally directed to the way In which
it is kept in the different countries.
TTnfioubtedly there is no country where
Christmas Is made so much of as in Ger-
Snany. It Is cot always easy to find out
the origin cf the different Christmas fes
tivals. It Â«*eems natural that the church
of Christ should keep the earthly birth
flay of her Lord, but there was one diffi
cultyâthat is the uncertainty of the real
day. TChat Bishop Jacob of Edessa said
In the seventh century, "Nobody knows
the day of Christ's birth." remains true
â¢until the present day. It is the same with
the place of the birth, as the conflicts
Â¦which have always taken place in the
Holy Land between the different sections
of the Christian churrti show. Perhaps
the Lord Intentionally allowed a veil to be
thrown over the exact dates of the events
of his earthly life in order to avoid a su
perstitious use of those dates, which
Trould easily draw people away from their
true spiritual value. This might be an
argument in favor of those Christian
<rhurchee of Protestantism which have
abolished those feasts altogether. The lat
ter view, however. Is not much in accord
ance with the general feeling of the
Christian population, especially in the old
countries. Particularly in Germany the
popular tendency to have festivals is very
jrreat. and Christmas, preceded by the
Advert fesson, followed by New Tear and
"Twelfth-night." Is certainly the greatest
of them. Pope Gregory the Great E.ild:
â¢â¢The heathen festivals must gradually be
ch.ir.ged Ir.to Christian ones, and the
Christian festivals must imitate these of
the time before Christ." and this principle
eeems to have been very generally adopt
ed. If in Italy the old Saturnalia and
Crumalla of the Romans have been turned
Into a celebration of the nativity, there
can be little doubt that in Germany the
old "Jul" festival was the foundation for
our Christmas. The "Jul" festival was
the greatest of our heathen forefathers.
Jt began en the night of the 24th of De
cember and lasted twelve nights, until the
Cth of Januaryâ the reafon why the day ol
Epiphany, which in some parts of Ger
many also bears the name of "high new
year." is called the Twelfth-night. It was
dedicated to the god Wodan. the "god of
heaven" of the old Germans, Â¦with one

Christian Institutions. No Christian

Association there always is a Christmas
festival for such young men as have
no home ties In the place where they
are living. Christian poetry has also
made the tree, which is generally short
ened Into "Christ baume" (Christ-tree), a
subject of different hymns, one of which
says, "The Christ tree Is the best of
trees."
Besides the tree we generally find in
Christian Institutions and in many
Christian homes the manger; that la, a

that remains unknown. Some people say
that it i-ame to us from the Scandinavian

that It should be after all a reminder of
the old "Jul" feast, where the houses
were decorated with branches. That It
should be a fir tree Is not only necessi
tated by natureâ only evergreens are
green In the midst of winter, but the
very quality Is a symbol of a good which
is not temporary and transient, like
earthly gooffs. The lights on the tree are
a symbol of Him who is the light at tht
world, who has come to lighten our dark
ness. The ornaments on the tree axe
symbols of all the good things, spiritual

When Emperor Fred

shortest day Is over, the days begin again
to lengthen and this is an event of im
portance for the Inhabitants of a northern
clime. The "Jul" festival Is the feast of
th* returning sun.
The popular idea was that at that time
the gods came down upon the earth to
bless humanity. Sacrifices were made in
their honor, things were brought out for
them to blessâ for instance water, which
was then considered as consecrated when
our forefathers were Christianizedâ we
intentionally use this expression, because
many of these were brought to the nsw

spiritual sun who makes an end to the

John the Baptist, who said, "I must de

..So very naturallv the old heathen "Jul"
feast ' wa<Â« gradually transformed into
Christmas. *What our heathen fore
fathers only fancied, that their gods visit

true when the son of God became man at
Bethlehem. The Imagined blessings of
the god -Wodan became real when God
visited his people.

times made at Christmas. A present Is

won him xespect and he was equal with
the best in the bohemlan and social life
of the city. He well, spent his
money freely and posed In perfect har
mony with the high class environment in
vhlch he found himself.
To many other people Antoine w:>s a
very different man. He was the com
panion of a woman who had been Ions
eno'igh in the tenderloin to earn several
aliases. He was a roisterer who need'd
no Instruction In that reckless, dangerous
life which begins after the electric lights
go out. He was a patron, with his com
panion, of houses which do not register
their guests. He was a gay spirit when
sober men are asleep. He was leading
two lives and those that knew him saw
cnly the surface of both. .>"I-*{
Behind his staid polished behavior In the
clubs and his boisterous midnight suppers
in the tenderloin was another life, an ex
istence of misery, of quarrels and crim
inations, of fisticuffs and disgraceful
scenes. His companion was his wife, a
Jealous, hot-tempered woman, who slapped
his face one moment and caressed him the
next; who had pleaded with him and won
from him the document which made her
his wife, and who then threatened to ex
pose him for an act which lie had consid
ered honorable.
Misery of His Secret Life.
By this woman Antoine was harassed
incessantly. His slightest movement was
watched by her Jealously. She shadowed
him to his place of business; to the haunts
where he met his friends and found recre
ation. She chlded him for his attentions
to other women. She scratched his face,
pulled his hair and upbraided him in vio
lent language. When he sought to calm
her she threatened to publish the fact
that she was his wife and In that publica
tion degrade him. When lri desperation
he threatened to kill himself and end the
storm and stress of his secret life, she
taunted him to keep his word, and now
he is at the door of death with a bullet
in his brain.
Paul Antoine met his wife three years
ago. She ' was then Mrs. Belle Posener.
the divorced wife of Julius Posener, whose
father gave her $100 with which to secure
a separation. She had been a saleswoman
in a local dry goods store, but after her
divorce she engaged in no regular occu
pation. She was known as Belle Chapelle
and then as Belle Forrest It was easier
for her to change her name than her po
sition.
Antoine met her and fell In love with
her. She seemed to reciprocate his feel
ing, and after two years and eight months
of pleading she per sauded him to marry
her. "
On many occasions he had promised her
that he would so so, and one night he de
clared that he was ready to keep his word
on one condition. He insisted that their
marriage be kert a profound secret. The
woman agreed to this, and on August 13
last she went to the office of the marriage
license clerk and secured a license. She
deliberately misspelled her own name and
that of Antoine.
On the following day the couple were
married by the Rev. H. H. Wikoff. with
F. Ellis Miller and A. H. Dorian as wit
nesses. The marriage did not change the
current. of affairs, which was drifting In
evitably to a tragedy. The woman be
came more and more exacting. She haunt
ed her husband at his office, followed him
on the streets, and constantly upbraided
him for what she Insisted was undue at
tention to other women. She demanded
that he acknowledge her as his wife. The
couple had? lived ; at 'various ' lodging
houses and then they decided that it was
best to live apart. The wife 'took apart
ments at S5S Geary street and the hus-
report to her his movements. The boy
did as he was directed.
At 6 o'clock Antoine called at his wife's
apartments on Geary street. She asked
him where he had been. He fabricated a
story to suit the occasion and the woman
reproached him. Ahtolne had been to the
Special Dispatch to The Call.

The Palace Hotel affqrds every facility
for private parties for the entertainment
of guests, so as to secure perfect seclu
sion. The rates for these unsurpassed ac
commodations and unrivaled service are
most reasonable, and in comparison with
other hotels of like renutation surprising
ly moderate. The grillroom is especially
adapted to the wants of business men and
the cafes to ladies and gentlemen of the
best classes. It is by its superior service
and the courteous treatment of patrons
by the management that the hotel 4 has
â¢won its reputation of being the favorite
hostelry, not only of San Francisco but of
the world.
Â¦ The location of the Palace is superb, it

The committeet.pronounces the proposi
tion of the Chiapas â¢ Rubber Plantation
and Investment Company to produce rub
ber for sale by cultivating the trees in
large numbers as a . feasible and-practi
cable enterprise.- The only trouble thus far
encountered hap been the scarcity of labor,
but plans for overcoming this have been
perfected.' It offers excellent returns for
the investment of small capital, and an
investment of $2 50 a month for â¢ forty
eight months will insure a fine annual In
come after six years. .The company has a
guarantee stock deposit of 5100.000 with
the American, Bank 'and Trust . Company
of San Francisco as an evidence of good
, faith with investors. >
The property of the company consists
of a plantation of 24,000 acres of the
choicest rubber .land, of Mexico,.. upon
which over 700,000 vigorous young rubber
trees now thrive. On the plantation also
are numerous mahogany trees, some of
which \are of prodigious growth, thus
demonstrating the richness of the soil.
The property is located in the department
of Palenque, State of Chiapas, and It la
unquestionably adapted to the production
of rubber and the growth of hardwood
timber trees of great variety. * _
The committee of investigation^ consisted
of Judge Lucien Shaw, Postmaster O. W.
Maulsby, Rev. L. M. Hartley of Red
lands, Cal.; E. A. Glrvin and C. A. West
enberg. They visited the property during
the current year, and in their report tho
information ia vouchsafed that the rubber
tree of the variety known as the Castil
loa Elastica is indigenous to the country
and especially to the lands lying along
the river Michol, on which ! the property
of the company has a wide frontage. Un
der one of these trees 1467 young rubber
plants were counted, ; all 'of which had
sprouted from, the seed that had fallen
from the tree during the present year.
The trees bloom In- their fifth- "year and
may. be safely tapped the year following.
Nurseries have been established for the
propagation of rubber trees and all are
thriving. A large force of men are em
ployed in building roads, planting trees
and developing the property. Managing
Director J. W. Ellsworth is now .on the
property and his careful attention to the
affairs of the company has received the
warmest commendation of the directorate.

LONDON; Dec. 15.â The public refuses
to be cajoled into taking a burning inter
est. In the~""is'icaragua canal, in spite of
the special American, cable dispatches,
which break the records for length and
seriousness. 1 ThV London Times' corre
spondent "to-day makes a passionate com
parison betwjeen the present stage. of af-'
fairs and that which existed at the time
of the Venezuela dispute, and bitterly ar
raigns President McKinley and the Sen
ate, yet Lord Pauncefote has not cabled a
word to the Foreign Office, which only
heard of the vote on the Davis amend
ment through the dispatches. Such pessi
mistic and indignant cable, messages a3
most of the London dailies are receiving
from their American correspondents find
ho responsive echo In Downing street,
where deprecation Is freely expressed of
these cabled efforts to apprise the. British
public. of how badly the Senate is alleged
to; be treating their Government. The
Foreign Office officials, while expecting
the, treaty to be amended, were
frankly surprised at the size of
the majority, which served more - than
anything else to open their eyes to the
fact that there was no truth in the ca
bled statements that the railroad interests
.were solely responsible for the opposition
or "that irrational jingoism had suddenly
become epidemic In the United States.
There exists in the Foreign Office a sane
appreciation of the American objections
to building the canal and not being al
lowed to fortify It. i
: "Yet, at the same time," says an official,
"we don't see why the treaty which we
made with the people whom ,we bellevea
to be. the responsible representatives of
â¢America should be treated so cavalierly
by the Senate. "We do not regard the
present issues as of any great importance,
for we doubt if the Nicaragua canal will
ever be a paying investment, and whoever
builds it it will be of little use to England,
either In peace or war. What we do re
gret is the apparent hopelessness of mak
ing^treatles with a country whose Senate
takes such opposite views to those it em
powers to act in its behalf. There seems
to be an impression in America that the
Clayton-Bulwer treaty was secured by the
cuteness of the English representative and
gave England an unfair advantage. That
view has never existed here. In fact,
rather the reverse. However, we shall
not bother our heads about the matter
until the Senate finishes its labors and we
receive the results through diplomatic
channels. We are anxious to know what
America really does want,~~and until we
know It is absurd to surmise what to do.
However, the Clayton-Bulwer treaty
worked satisfactorily for years and as
new- treaties seem to cause dissensions In
America mav be it is Just as well as if
vie are obliged to revert to the former
agreement, the ;bindingness and equity of
which we have never for a moment doubt
ed, in spite of our concessions in the Hay-
Pauncefote treaty." â¢ Â¦Â¦ Â¦: Â¦

STURGEON TRAPS ARE
DESTROYED BY OFFICERS
Deputy Fish Commissioners Pay a
Visit to the San Joaquin
River.
Ab a result of their excursion up the
Sar. Joaquin ar.d neighboring rivers Dep
uty Fisfc Commissioners John H. Davis,
M. L. Cross and Hugh Walter reported
yesterday -having destroyed 106 sections
of sturgeon tishing tackle and contiscated
twenty-four anchors used in holding the
jll^^al traps in the bed of the rivers. The
Kith Commissioners are highly elated
over the result of the trip. They now
c-wait the coming of owners to identify
their anchors, but as this would mean
imprisonment and heavy fines there is no
danger of the rishermen making their ap-
j >f a ranee.
It is understood ihat the Fish Ommis-
Fior.ers will use every effort to induce the
L< gislature to pars a law making it a
misdemeanor to catch and sell sturgeon
Th^Fe fish are becoming scarcer every
>ear, and unless their destruction ceases
for a time tney v/ill he exterminated.
The jnry. after Ix-Jr.g: out Fevcn hours
ycst<?rday. found Albert Hoff guilty of the
murder of Mrs. Clute end fixed the pen
alty at life imprisonment. At 11:13 o'clock
yesterday morning the jury, a-fter re
ceiving the charge from Judge Carroll
Cook, retired. At the noon hour the
jcron were taken to lunch in charge of
t.wo deputy sherllTj?. Soon after their re
turn the beJl mr.g and it was thought that
a verdict would be rendered. The Judge
took his scat on the bench and the attor
ney? en both sides of the case were repre
ftnted. In a dead silence Charles A.
Zir.kand. who had been elected the fore
man, rose from his seat and stated that
the jury could not come to any definite
decision until the court would answer two
questions and allow them to retire to re
consider the ease. He also asked that
they might be allowed to take the dia
grams of the house and the photos into
-the Jury-room with them. This last re-
Quest was refused by the Judge. The
Jirst question was whether the court
would read the testimony of Mrs. Legg,
the woman who saw IlofC leave the house.
This testimony was read by the Judge.
Juror Hawkins then asked the court if
Mrs. L*>gg's statement that "to her best
knowledge and beliÂ»-f" Albert Hoff was
the man that !eft lhe house was legally
an identilication. After a recess, Judge
Cook decided that he could not answer
the latter question and that the jurors
tuust allow the weight of the answer to
convince themselves. After retiring
fcgain to the jury-room, the jury after
three ballots derided on the verdict
â¢tated. Un the !irst ballot eight jurors
â¢tcod for hanging, two voted not guilty
and two blank slips were placed in the
box. On the second ballot eight still
stood for hanging and four did not vote.
At last murder In the first degree with the
penalty of life imprisonment was agreed
on as a compromise verdict.
In the morning Eugene Deuprey closed
the arxument for the people. Soon after
ward Judge Cook charged the jurors and
Instructed them as to the law. Imme
diately on the retirement of the jury HofC
acted in a very nervous manner. The
accused man took a pencil out of his
pocket and kept on scribbling on a news
pa;>or in a bold hand: "in manus tuas
Domini comendo ppiritum meum," trans
lated from the Latin meaning, "Into the
1-ord's hands I commend my spirit.'*
Every time the jury would come
Hoff s oyes would flash and he would look
from fate to fa^e and try to read the ver
dict. Clute. the husband of the mur
d^ied woman, was in attendance all dav,
and it was claimed that he intended to
fhoot the defendant down in the court
room should he be acquitted, but the be
reaved man had good control of himself
and stated that Chief Lees had made him
jiromise that he would attempt no assault
on Hnff before he was permitted in the
courtroom during: the first trial.
Judge Cook will pass sentence on Hoff
next Tuwday. Schooler stated last even
ing that he had ajÂ» yet decided on no fu
ture cour?e to secure Hoffe release and
that no actiÂ»a would be taken until the
c?.5^ came uj> tiext Tuesday.

STEAMSHIP RATES TO
ALASKA WILL 3FAIX
Probable Result of the Advent of
Several New Companies Into
the Traffic .
VANCOUVER, Dec. 15.â The coming of
several new companies into the coast
steamship traffic between Puget Sound
and British Columbia ports and Alaska
threatens to make rates take a tumble
early in the spring. Steamboat men say
that with the competition now in prospect
rates probablv will be cut in half. Dur
ing the past two years the Alaska Steam
ship Association has pretty fully con
trolled rates, but this organization is now
dormant, and company managers claim
that no effort will be made to effect any
definite amalgamation of traffic the com
ing season.
The Pacific Steamship Company has
contented itself with running the Cottage
City and smaller boats on the Skaguay
run, and the announcement that the Sen
ator and two or three other large ves
sels will be put on has been received with
much concern by local owners. Dodwell
& Co. have commenced operating the Vic
torian and the City of Seattle and will
put on two more boats. A -Vancouver
company will operate under 'civic sub
sidy two large steamers being negotiated
for on the Atlantic, while the smaller
companies are increasing their capacities
for business. The probability is that by
May 1 the first class rate of $30 to Skag
uay will have been " cut one-half. '

BANX OF CATYTPOItNIA.
A. Financial Institution of Recognized
Strength and Stability.
When the history of ' banking In San
.Francisco comes to be written, the story
of the foundation and futuro growth of
the Bank of California will he among its
most cqnspicuous features. Recognized as
one of the soundest financial Institutions
in the world, the bank still occupies the
quarters at California and Sansome
streets in the building erected for it by
its founders years ago. In this location
the bank has experienced the vicissitudes
that confront every human endeavor and
each In turn was vanquished by its wise
and fearless conductors, so that to-day it
is stronger than ever before in its financial
career.
The Bank of California was incorporated
in April, 1864, by D. O. Mills and William
C. Ralston. The capital stock at that
time was fixed at $3,000,0130, but two years
later this was increased to $5,000,000. In
1S81, however, certain unfavorable legis
lation affecting banks prompted the reduc
tion of the increased capital stock to be
reduced to the original figure, at which it
stands to-day.
. The romance of the history of the bank
Is coincident with that of the Comstock.
In those days of unparalleled activity In
Comstock stocks, local banks did not hes
itate to advance as high as V'i*) on shares
of that stock. The reaction which inev
itably succeeds periods of inflation set in,
and the result was the suspension of the
bank in 187*. Mr. RaJston's death under
pathetic circumstances followed, but forty
days after closing its doors the Bank of
California had redeemed Itself in public
confidence by paying Its obligations dollar
for dollar.
This great result was accomplished,
through the sagacity and skill of Presi
dent D. O. MillB and his counselors on the
board of directors. In April. 1878. he re
signed his office In favor of William Al
vord, a financier of note, who has since
that time ably conducted the multitudin
ous affairs of the institution.
President Alvord, whose conservatism
has won for him the esteem of all con
nected with the bank, has an able coad
jutor In ThomasBrown, the veteran cash
ier, whose, connection with the bank dates
ba<:k to October, 1S70. Mr. Brown is a
financier whose Judgment in financial af
fairs has lifted him to the eminence oc
cupied only by authorities.
The assets of the bank on October 1 ag
gregated $20,893,5188 34. Its reserve fund Is
$1,000,000 and there is due depositors $12,
421,266 57. The money on hand amounts to
$3.&r<3,G3S 62. while its loans and discounts
rÂ«Â«ach $10,319,019 28. The directors include

TOPEKA, -Dec, 15.-:Oplnion3 concern
ing tne telegraphers' strike have mate
rially changed to-day. Instead of the ln-
difference . which has been manifested '"by
some of the railroad officials during, the
past few days a disposition to be con
stantly on the alert has shown Itself.
â¢ The officials of the Santa Fe have at
last become convinced that the strik?""
means something. The cause of this Is
the unrest prevalent among tho engineers,
conductors and brakemen. It Is regarded
as almost a certainty that some ot these
workers will go on a sympathetic strike
,within two days unless the differences
between the company and the operators
are. speedily adjusted.-^
The resolution of me trainmen in tak
ing this step is not thought to compre
hend so much sympathy tor the operators
as it does their own interests. Said a
prominent engineer to-day: , '
"If we sufter this thing to go by un
questioned, the right of the company to
do as it pleases will be permanently es
tablished and In spite of anything we can
do the rights and privileges of organized
labor will be hopelessly lost. It is the
principle we are striving for, and come
what may, the principle must and will be
maintained that organized labor must
and will be maintainedâ that organized
labor must have its rights."
As tar as can be learned there have not
yet been any conferences held between
the telegraphers and the representatives
of the trainmen's organizations. There "
an air of mystery aDout all the transac
tions, however, which makes It amount to
a practical certainty that there will be
something done within a short time.
President Dolphin looked very wise
â¢when asked by a press correspondent to
night what was in the wind.
"Well, just wait a little while," he re
plied. "We will have something to spring
soon that will 'curl your hair," so to speak.
What is it? Well, I cannot give that out
to-night. However, you may say this
with confidence: The telegraphers never
felt so good at any time during the pro
gress of the strike as they do right now.
We recognized from the start that we had
a hard fight, and we did not go Into It
unadvisedly and without a knowledge of
what we could expect In the way of sup
port from the other organizations. Come
around to-morrow and I think I will hava
something to tell you that will make the
people unanimously of the opinion that
there Is something in the strike." >
The Santa Fe officials deny that there
have been any representations made to
them by the officers of the trainmen's or
ganizations.
According to the best information that
can be received, however, representations
will be made to the officers of the road
Monday morning and they will be in
formed that the best thing they can do
will be to adjust things with the oper
ators.

physician, but he never seemed to do me any
good, I wrote to Dr. R. V. Pierce for advice,
which I received, telling me to take his ' Favorite

I took thirteen bottles of * Favorite Prescription'
and eight of 'Golden Medical Discovery.' when
I had used the medicine a month mv health was
much improved. It has continued to imnrovc

THE LITTLE SICKNESSES
Which Grow Into Big Ones.
A little cold In the head Is a trifle, but If
neglected and It hangs on from week to
week and gets Into the throat and lungs it
Is no longer a trifle. It is then no longer
a Blight cold but the beginning of chronic
catarrh. '
Do not make thÂ« mistake of thinking you
have no catarrh because the head and
nose appear to be clear. If there is cough,
tickling In the throat, 'hoarseness or a
sense of oppression In the chest you have
throat and bronchial catarrh. If the ap-
petite Is poor, nausea, gagging and dis-
gust for food, especially In the morning, â¢
you have catarrh of the stomach.
The surest and safest treatment for
every form of catarrh is an Internal rem-
edy which acts especially on the blood !
and mucous membranes.
Such a remedy Is the new catarrh cure,
sold everywhere by druggists under name
of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, a medicine in
pleasant, convenient tablet form and con-
taining all the hest and latest specifics for
catarrh, whether located In nose, throat
bronchial tubes or etomach.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are composed
of Sanguinaria, guaiacol, Red gum and
similar antiseptics which destroy the {
germs of catarrh In the blood, and no one
who suffers from any form of catarrh and I
has seen the uselessnesa of sprays,
douches, an# powders, will ever go back
to them after once trying so convenient,
pleasant and harmless a remedy as J
Stuart's Catarrh tablets and one which ;
gives relief in so shdrt a time. , ,
Even in cases where catarrh has af- j
fected the senses of smell and hearing, i
these tablets accomplish a cure because
the blood being cleansed of catarrhal
germs, the mucous surfaces of the nose
and throat no longer clog up the respira- |
tory passages with catarrhal secretions.
All druqglPts sell full sized treatments of '
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets for the nominal j
prlco of 50 cents, and the regular daily use I
of them will effectually cure this trouble- j
some and dangerous disease. i

WASHINGTON. Dec. 15.â James G.

' engaged to Miss Martha Kichborn of

' r.aval constructor, is celebrated far and

*3Mtai!M*rtta Hichborn has for several

I most beauUtul young woman in the

'Â¦Â¦ t"-e utmost rtfenement ax.d of many ac
Â¦ coniptisr.n:er.Â»s. Tfcfct she will wed young
I M- Blairs can hardly be credited by
Ine-ci^ of eitber. jet the report seems to

The divorce sÂ«:u:ed by Mrs. Blame the
! frÂ«=t from "ycur.g Jira." as he is famil
lariv called in \\ aehington. and the tes
t'niccv adduced at the trial showing his
' treatment of his wife, are too fre^h in the
â¢ --ublic n:lr.d to need reretition here. Mrs.
> 31aine after securing her divorce went
: en the stags. She atterwrard rnarried Dr.

James G. Jr. has continued to reside in
Washington, excep: at intervals when he
â¢ has ccmniendably tried to shift fcr hirn
', ecU. but ail of his attempts seem to have
b^en failures. He was appointed a cap
tain in the volunteer army by President
: MrKir.ley through his mothers influence
with crfd-time friends of Secretary Blaine,
but sooa after reaching Manila was re
called and was later mustered out of the
service, much against his inclination. It
will be remembered that while en route
tc the Philippines he engaged in several
1 carousals, especially wnen his ship
i touched at Honolulu. His conduct was
1 reported to the War Department and his
; recall was speedy.
Then Mr. Blaine tried newspaper re
i porting in New York City. It was be
: lieved by an enterprising city editor that
! the magic name of James G. Blaine. al
! thousrh it had "Jr." on th? end of it.
I would prove an open sesame and would
i admit young Mr. Biaine through portals
I and secure interviews with prominent
i ioliticians visiting New York where other
j reporters wctld fail. For some time he
j contributed a column on the editorial
i page of the New York Tribune under the
1 caption. 'The Passing Throng." This was
r.oihing more than what '.p known in
newspaper parlance as the hotel column.
I end young Blaine was merely the hotel
reporter, out he was iwoud of the dis-
I Â¦Jinction of navtna: his matter printed on
j tbe editorial pajre and promised to do
I well. But fcr some reason or other he
gave up this employment and returned to
Washington, where he has since lived
Trtth his mother.

TH^r ZSSZPOBXTJICwise finds expression, the voice of the
sub-consciousness and super-conscious
ness: in short, ia a commonplace of the
Wagnerian philosophy, and in his wholly
adequate recognition of this lies the chief
strength of the German master.
Wagner holds that by no other method
than the "unending melody*' so tailed,
can a complete musical picture be pre
sented.
To the voice in the music-drama is only
allotted that which naturally finds speech
In any cireumsuance; to the orchestra Is
assigned the taj-kâ Inherently "unending

ening the emotional color, the psyofclral
suggestion of the surroundings and. as far
as is acoustically possible or desirable, the
physical atmosphere. This. then, beins

of the old Greek chorus, no logical con
clusion of its melody can come before the
act's end, for to these things is no end.
but only continual change. They ar*Â» the
background of the picture, and upon them
the singer paints the high lights of his
emotion. His melody also consistently
and logically lacks the formal cadence ex

cal and dramatic exigencies. It ofclv gain*
thereby in true definiteness. but the ear.
sophisticated riy the arbitrary rtse and
fall of older melody forms, still demands
its little cadence in spite of every viola
tion of dramatic sense. The raison
d'etre of the older melody form is not sel
dom found in the famed high C of one
singer, the gymnastic ability of another,
the claim of another to the musical cen
ter of the stage for a specified length of
time, and ln such like vital artistic rea

arbitrary recipe of so many solos of just
such kind, so many concerted numbers,
so much choral work and so much or
chestral accompaniment occurring ln just
such place, an.l the drama In the mean
time lest in the crowd.
From Gluck down, the operatic reform
er's effort has been directed against these
things, and it is claimed that Wagners
"unending melody." in which song is com
rade to sense, h&a obviated this chief op
eratic absurdity. It is further claimed
that the so-called "unending melody"
punctuates itself in accordance with all
essential laws of vocal expression, and
that it is the only logical form in which
music can be wedded to drama. It is
granted that in a combination of the arts
each nvist sacrifice something of its su
premacy, but the sum total of the com
promise is so infinitely more worth hav
ing 'than the single gift of each, that,
even with its deficiencies, the music
drama as evolved by Wagner is the most
satisfying art form that we are yet ac
quaint with, and its noble ideal a glimpse
of the highest that has been permitted to

At a recent banquet of the-St. Nicholas Society in New York Mark Twain said: "Gen~
tlemen, you have the best municipal government in the world and the purest and most fragrant.
The very angels envy you and wish they could establish a government like it in heaven. You
got it by a noble fidelity to civic duty." Of course the banqueters laughed, for everything Mark
says goes as a joke, but on reading the thing over next morning they were inclined to think him
sarcastic, and now they wish to know what he meant by making such a speech on an occasion
designed strictly for the joy of self-laudation. ; .
In discussing ways and means to bring about a reform in New York society, Bishop Pot
ter says: . "What would be the effect if a company of men and women of recognized leadership
should bind themselves together to illustrate in their hafbit of life simplicity of attire, inexpensive
ness in their dwellings; and should further bind themselves to discourage the habit of excessive
accumulation." The answer to the question is easy. Those leaders would be lost from the swim
after the first season and nobody would pay enough, attention to them to notice whatthey were

SOME time ago Mr. Alexander, a Hawaiian sugar planter, visited Porto Rico to investigate
the possibility of transferring laborers from that island to the sugar plantations of Maui.
He was reported as finding the project feasible.
As.a~resu.lt a number of Porto Ricans were willing to try the experiment and started to
their new employment. A morning journal met them this side the California line and by repre
senting that they were going into association and perhapstintb slavery with the Chinese induced
a large number of them to desert in this city. Thereupon it uses them as an advertising facility
and appeals for charity for them, intending to be the almoner of what others donate.
The Call knows nothing further about these people or the employment they were.. to en
ter than the public knows. They were being well cared for en route, and there is no reason for
doubting that they would have been well treated on their arrival in Hawaii. The people of this
city owe it to the false representations of the Examiner. that a large number of them are left here,
to burden us by a demand for charity or congest our labor market by a demand for work-
It was a splendid opportunity for yellow journalism, and was duly improved.
THE PORTO RICANS.
AMONG the benefits for which San Francisco is indebted to the Merchants' Association may
be included the debate at the recent annual banquet on "Municipal Ownership and Opera
tion of Public Utilities." The discussion of the evening furnishes the people of the city
with most valuable instruction concerning an issue which is now one of practical politics, and it
is therefore gratifying thar the association has published in the current number of the Review
all the speeches in full, so that they are now available for reading and study by all who take an
earnest interest in the question.
It is to be noted that the subject is presented not only from both sides, for and against mu
nicipal ownership, but also from the different standpoints of practice and of theory. Thus in a
comparatively brief space the reader will have the benefit of something like a comprehensive pre
sentation of the whole subject.
The editor of the Review 1 directs attention to the fact that all the speakers of the evening,
despite their differences upon the main question, agreed that a good and honest civil service sys
tem "is absolutely essential to successful public ownership; that municipal. operation of any pub
lic utility without the merit system is doomed to inevitable failure; that it is the essence of folly
to imagine that water works or lighting plants can be honestly and economically conducted by
a municipality dpminated by the spoils system of party politics."
The recent scandals disclosing the lax if nol corrupt methods by which the civil service is
conducted in this city under the present administration .renders this point of agreement among
the speakers at the symposium a matter of no little significance. With all questions involved in
the general one of municipal ownership and operation of public utilities the voters' of San Fran-
Wsco will soorter or later have to deal; and it will therefore be well for them to give heed to this
one truth which the debate at the banquet appears to have established beyond controversy.
THE MERCHANTS' SYMPOSIUM.

â T"HE late Senator Davis left on record the statement that his amendment to the Hay-Paunce-
I fote treaty, which the Senate has adopted, was copied after the English sectiorfof the treaty
of Constantinople, under which the Suez canal was built. .. .
That canal was a shorter route between Great Britain and her Indian possessions, and she
put in the treaty the. provision which her interests required. It may well be argued that she is
estopped from objecting to the appearance of a like principle in the treaty affecting our isthmian
canal. There may be reasons on our side, however, which -go against importing the principles of
a European treaty into our policy. It may prove to have been better had we insisted upon the ab
solute neutrality of the canal. The Suez canal is in territory alien to; England as the Nicaragua
canal is in territory alien to us. By transferring to it the principle of the treaty of Constantino
ple we admit the right of a nation to apply that principle to any canal in alien territory where
the circumstances of national interest are the same. France evidently sees this, and sees in it re
vival of interest in the Panama canal. That route is a shorter way between France and her pos
sessions in the Pacific Ocean. With our canal fortified and garrisoned, she Will have no rights to .
its use in a time of stress and strife unless we choose to concede them. Therefore, she has a rea^
son for using her concession on the Panama route and applying to her canal the principles of .
the treaty of Constantinople. - -.
As Germany, Russia and Portugal all have Pacific possessions, affected by the" same neces
sity for a short water route, France might easily .lead a European, concert in constructing, the
Panama canal under the principles of the treaty of Constantinople. Then the situation would be
reversed. As England is now regarded as estopped from objecting to a provision which she
originated, we would be equally estopped from objecting to its extension to the Panama canal.
The Monroe doctrine would hardly be involved and the outcome might be the digging and opera
tion of two canals instead of one, and what selfish advantage we would -gain by failure to neutral
ize our canal would be lost by the building of a rival waterway. .

The second act reveals the wall re
moved, symbolizing the unification of the
two families. Rut It is only when divided
by this wall that the two old men can
stand securely: united they fallâ out.
Having the unstinted privilege of each
other's society, of this society they soon
grow tired; having no difficulties, either
real or imaginary, to overcome, they use
up their *up<?rfluou!Â« energy in studying
each other's faults". This leads to a furious
quarrel. When in this mood they over
hear a conversation of high-wrought sen
timentality between the lovers. Percinet
vaunts hiF prowess in the duel and joins
ln mutual congratulations with Syivette
upon their taking rank with the immortal
band of loversâ Romeo and Juliet. Thlebe
and Pyramus. Armnita and her shepherd,
Petrarch and Lama. Not content -with
this, the young people poke fun at their
uns?atinuntal parents: Syivette, adoring,
declares that her Percinet's father is like
a tame duck who has hatched an eagle's
egg. At this Bergamin is eo enraged that
he blurts out'the secret of the Ordered

rroduces Straf Orel's bill. Percinet, too. Is

Straforel chores this happy moment
again to present his bill. Percinet, en
raged, attacks him. but is easily beaten
off. The unlucky sentimentalist then
lushes off. declaring that he leaves home
"to drink and dice and brawl until the
whole^world stare." Straforel again pre
sents his bill to Bergamin. again has it re
jected and decides that the only way he
can get It paid is by trying to bring about
the reconciliation of the lovers. With this
faint gleam of hope for poor Syivette the
second act closes.
The third act contains but one scene of

play. It might be entitled "A Oure For

youth and Inexperience.
KIPLING has somewhere said that

said omission was possibly Ies3 a compli
ment to the complexity of the art than a
thrifty recognition of the universal civil-
Ian conviction that, if there Is yne thine
easier than anotner. It is to fight battles.
There are other arts, too. Though music
cannot boast of a distinguished omission
from Kipling's "six-pennorths" of wis
dom, the ordinary layman regards the art
from exactly the same patronizing stand
point as that from which the civilian
critic regards affairs military. That

rance of its ' elements, not even
the physical incompetency for . its
appreciation, not even the utmost lack
of sympathy with its ideals and purposes,
will deter him, if he so choose, from de
livering an opinion on the subject, which
he expects shall be taken seriously by a
waiting world. Nay further. Music Â«s
the only art of which entire ignorance is
often professed with a certain pride, and
may be thus professed without shame in
our curious civilization. It is the only
physical incapacity, to say naught of an
intellectual and emotional lack, upon
which civilized man ia ever known to
pride himself, from him who proudly ac
knowledges that he cannot "tell one tune

blindness to the new day's harvest of tone
color, the later revelations of the inner
spirit of harmony.-
It is unusual, for example, complacently
to challenge attention to one's own astig
matic eyesight, to point with pride to a
nose impervious to the violet's, perfumed
charm, to advertise a cheek Insensate to
the touch of tiny fingers or even to own
a lack of capacity for the appreciation pi
an olive; but as to tone deafness, that is
another story. Even of the chief execu
tive of the nation it has been Joyfully
told that his musical boast was a knowl
edge of two tunes only; "one was 'Yan
kee Doodle* and the other wasn't." An
old joke, true and threadbare, but with
a point vastly different from its accepted
significance.
Kings and rulers of the Old World, rep
resentatives of that bete noire of Ameri
can democracy, the "effete monarchy,
in spite of admittedly neroic sins of all
sorts, nevertheless have been and still
are patrons of the thing beautiful as it
is known to us. It has always been the
fashion among them to affect interest in
the arts, even If such Interest has been
backed by no real love or knowledge,
purely from a valuable conviction of the
importance of these things to the higher
well "being of their people, and a perhaps
only hair-conscious recognition that only
through such means could themselves,
their reigns, their countries gain any
lasting historical significance. Even Nero
fiddled, it will be rememberedâ and re
membered, 1 warrant, more widely than
any other known fact of his tyrant reign.
It Is true the ages have also registered
the periodic grunt of tone-deaf philoso
phers, whose pathetic deprivation has
called forth such fleeting description as
"music, the most expensive of noises,"
and the like. But it has been reserved
for to-day to produce such lasting monu
ment to an author's^ musical incapacity
as is ventured unashamed in "Degenera
tion," and. for the matter of that, in
"What Is Art?" also.
With Tolstoi there Is no immediate con
cern, but the Wagnerlan gospel, accord
ing to Nordau. has appeared In these col
umns within the week and under no less
distinguished patronage than that of my
esteemeu friend and collaborateur, Pro
fessor Syle. Professor Syle's personal at
titude In the matter is eminently modest.
Pretending no familiarity with the art
musical, he has contented himself where
opportunity for composite criticism oc
curred, with dealing only with the dra
matic verities.
In the particular Instance of the music
drama, however, he has permitted him
self a mistaken belief in the better judg
ment of the German savant, and has thus
afforded Nordau yet another opportunity
for the promulgation of his musical
heresies. Not that It matters much here,
as any Wagnerite may comfortably say
after the reception accorded to the
"Ring" during the late' Grau season, but
heresies they are. and as such irritating
in their prominence.
â¢ ' * â¢
Nordau is a plausible wretch. He cries
no complimentary charge of unorthodoxy
against Wagner, fully aware that the
heterodoxy of to-day is to-morrow's
orthodoxy and the later day's tradition.
He prefers, instead, the subtler charge of
atavism, Wagner posing throughout his
argument as the model for the musical
degenerate. "No music of the future Is
this," .he says, but a return to. outworn
forms, a retrogression, a mere retravel
ing of an ancient path, with v the typical
atavistic delusion of its novelty.
His chief definite accusations against
the master are: His alleged "confusion
of the means of expression"; his "Ignor
ance of what is possible to each art ; his
"indeflnlteness of thought and feeling,"
as typified in the "unending melody " and
a barren mysticism, as exemplified In the
"leit-motif."
As to the first, Waener's credo, as I
take it, is briefly this: Each art has its
possibilities, its limitations: no art is
therefore perfect In Itself: but It Is possi
ble to combine all the meanc of art ex
pression into one perfect whole. Written
Poetry, appealing only to the eye,' is rela
tively barren. Add Toneâ musical speechâ
and there Is one joy gained. Again add
the Dance, by which Wagner understands .
graceful action, the "poetry of ,motlon,"
and your perfect art Is one step nearer
Its goaC Lastly, to Poetry. Music. Ac
tion add the scenic art, and In Painting
you have the final appeal to the spirit
and sense. The crucial difficulty Is now,
of course, the maintenance of the balance
between the several arts, and further the
right apportionment to each of its own
peculiar function. Right here It is that
Nordau 'claims the essential failure of
Wagner's art. his "confusion of all the
means of expression." Right here also I
claim the essential Impertinence of the
unmusical philosopher in attempting to
define the possibilities and limitations of
an art of which his every written line
shows him lamentably ignorant. With
him who regretted his inability to furnish
brains for the understanding of his phi
losophy Wagner might well lament the
Impossibility of furnishing ears for the
hearing of h!s work!
Nordau alleges Wagner's use of music
to express that which has been and. may
be better expressed by poetry. What may
or may not be expressed by music is still
largely an unknown quantity. Queer tales
are to'ld of Its power of suggestion and a
definite suggestion at that. A deaf-mute
suddenly restored to hearing describes the
blare of trvmpets. as "scarlet." Musi
cians frequently claim- that each note
suggests to them a definite color anrt in
stances of like kind can be Indelinltely
multiplied. But Wagner claims no such
power for his medium. - . Â«
As to definite concrete form, none krew
better than Wagner the ineptitude of mu
sic to express that, and at no time- has he
ever claimed the possibility. , Music can
not say "This is a sword, says Nordau.
No one said It could, but music, even to
the least sensitive far In a regiment, can
say "Fight!'! ThB "leit-motif cannot
label, like the word, the hero's â¢ sword.
No, but It can suggest and intensify the
martial mood, which is all that Its gifted
author has ever claimed for it. ... â¢
That a key to the otherwise "undeci
pherable hieroglyphics of the Leit-Motif
scheme" is essential ."to .the enjoyment of
the Wagnerlan opera is another delusion
and a snare, a fallacy perpetuated by the
victims of the handbook habit for the
benefit of that innumerable crowd of little
men who shriek -themselves -Into prom
inence over a great man's shoulder. , No
further than the usual modest acquaint
ance with the libretto ia required -for the
music-drama's understanding. The leit
motif Is always there, faithful handmaid

Inartistic chaos; but a knowledge of its

purpose-and these who have ears to hear
deny such failure. Â¦

the Corners.
What thin folks need Is flesh or muscle,
not fat.
What Thin People Need to Bound Off
To be symmetrical and properly propor-
tioned every person should have a certain
amount of excess fiesh, but to be plump
does not necessarily mean to be fat.
Fat is undesirable; it clogs and retards
the action of the muscles. Interferes with
the healthy action of the heart and lungs
and when very excessive, predisposes too
latty degeneration of vital organs, to say
nothing of the discomfort resulting from
top much adipose tissue.
Common sense would suggest that If one
wishes to become) fleshy and plump the
thing most needed would be flesh forming
foodâ that is, albuminous foods like eggs,
beef, oatmeal, etc.
The kinds of food which make flesh are
the foods we have on our table* ;evtry
day; but the trouble is that our stomachs
from weakness or derangement of some
kind do not promptly and properly digest
Really, the principal reason so many peo-
ple remain thin is because their stomachs
do not properly and completely digest and
assimilate the flesh forming beefsteak and
eggs we eat every day.
There are thousands of such people, and
they are really dyspeptics, although they
may net suffer any particular pain or in-
convenience from their stomachs.
If such persons and all thin people
t would lake after t^eir meals some simple
and natural digestive, like Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets, the food would be quickly
Cipested and the proper degree of piump-
i>ess vtry socn result because these tab-
lots are prepared exactly for that purpose
They digest every variety of flesh forming
food, which Is the real reason why they
so quickly build up and strengthen thin
dyspeptic men and women.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets cure every
form of Indigestion on this common-sense
plan, that they thoroughly digest the food
promptly, giving strength to every nerve
and organ ln the body, and the weakened
stomach a chance to rest and recover its
natural vigor. Nothing further is required
to cure any stomach trouble, except can-
cer of the stomach. They make thin, dvs-
peptic people strong, plump and well "

Mr. Christensen was formerly the local
manager of the American Central Insur
ance Company of St. Louis and the St.
Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company
of St. Paul, Minn., where Mr. Goodwin
was his assistant manager.
The new fltm of Christensen, Edwards
& Goodwin will take charge of the Pacific
Coest business cf the American, Manches
ter and Caledonian at once.
When Balfour. Guthrie & Co. gave up
their insurance agencies L. B. Edwards
was placed In charge of the agen
cies oa this coast. Shortly after
ward Mr. Conroy Joined Mr. Edwards as
assistant manager and for a time every
thing was satlstactory in the offlce i/I
waras and Conroy had been in charge of
the agencies of the companies for two
years, when last July, to th* surprise of
the local insurance world. Mr. Edwards
was dropped out of the management and
Mr Conroy became manager in his place.
New to "the surprise of Insurance men
the tables are reversed and Mr. Conroy
has been deposed and Mr. Edwards Is
once more in harness for the Balfour-
Guthrie agencies.
Mr Hoadley was seen last evening at
the Palace Hotel, and in reply to a ques
tion as to the cause of the changes said:
â¢â¢It is purely a business proposition, and
we have made the change for the best In
terests of all parties. Although the
American Company is as strong as the
Caledonian and Manchester, we were
only getting 14 per cent of the business
oi the office end we felt that Mr. Conroy
was not securing for us the business we
wt-rc certainly entitled to. I came out
here especially to Investigate the matter,
and late this afternoon decided to make
the change. Our company has the best of
feeling"? toward Mr. Conroy, but we nat
urally had to look out for our interests.
As far as I and my company are con
cerned, you can state that we have not
severed our connection with Mr. Conroy
on account of any friction in the agency
here. We make this change solely for
business reasons."
Secretary P. L. Hoadley of the agency
department of the American Insurance
Company of Newark. N. J., has been here
for the past week making an investiga
tion which has resulted in T. J. Conroy
being superseded as the local representa
tive cf the American. Caledonian and
Manchester companies.
A lively shake-up occurred in insurance

this class of pavements it has practically
no competitor. Its facilities for doing
this work are unexcelled and only the
latest and best appliances are employed.

sewer pipe known to the trade. A pav
ing brick of unsurpassed quality is also
turned out and the chemistry department
of the State University attests to its ex
cellence and superiority for paving pur
poses.
During the present- year the company
laid many miles of pavement in this city,
besides completing the concrete wharf at
Howard street and making extensive im
provements at Sacramento, Bakersfleld,
Stockton and Fresno. The office of the

The decision of the court was based on
a stipulation filed November 3, 1897, and
definitely determines the title to the valu
able property In question. . -."Vi^-
An action was instituted recently to
quiet title to the property. The action was
entitled Harrletta Lyman, otherwise
known as Sister Marie Immaculate; Han
nah Wall, known as Sister Mary Jose

Mary Evangelist, by their guardian. Oscar
F. Meldon. and Alma Schumann, knoVm
as Sister Mary Aloysius, against Bridget
Mines, known as Sister Perpetuo; Annie
McCarthy, known as Sister Claire, and
the Glris Directory Orphan Asylum.
: The case was heard by zfudge Dainger

cision was handed down yesterday aa
stated. The court, also finds that the
Girls' Directory Orphan Asylum never
was a corporation, that the- plaintiffs and
defendants never were the members of an
alleged corporation of that name and that
the deeds under which the alleged cor
poration claimed title to the property
were null and void and of no effect.
Judge Daingerfleld has decided that the
Girls' Directory Orphan Asylum is not a
corporation, ' and that the asylum prop
erty, at Waller and Lott streets, is not
that of a corporation, but belongs solely
to Bridget Mines, known as Sister Per

Chief among the civil engineers and
land surveyors of the Pacific Coast is
John A. Benson, whose ottlco is at 507
Montgomery street. There Is no man In
California more familiar with the land
surveys made by the, Government during
the past thirty years than Mr. Benson.
He was himself In the employ of the Gov
ernment for years as surveyor and his
surveys have Invariably stood the test
when titles to lands surveyed by him were
In dispute.
Mr. Benson's equipment for the busi

data necessary to put the Inquirer as to

In connection with a full complement of
maps, surveys, etc.,, Mr. Benson has a
finely equipped library of works . bearing

These were collected by Mr. -Benson at
the expenditure of much time and money,
but. the library is at the service of all.
who desire information pertaining to the
subjects treated.
in addition - to obtaining titles to Gov
ernment lands In California, Mr. Benson .:
is prepared to' secure titles to -any va
cant; Unappropriated public lands of 'the
United States, surveyed or unsurveyed,
by means of Forest Reserve Rights and
other scrip. This Is an important phase
of Mr. Benson's business, which has In
recent years rendered him most prominent
among land men of the Pacific Coast. His
facilities for expediting have been such
that In this branch of buslnes he Is prac
tically without .a competitor.
Mr. Benson .Is one of the best known
'citizens of San Francisco. He is a native
of Jefferson County, N. Y., and his ear
lier education was received in the public
schools. He was an apt scholar and . in
mathematics his attainments were es
pecially noteworthy., He is a graduate of
the Warren Collegiate Institute of Illi
nois, and on his graduation he began the
study of civil engineering, which ne sub
sequently adopted as his profession. He
served as surveyor of Keokuk County,
Iowa, for five years, and at the expiration
of his term of office he came to this city
and established himself with marked suc
cess. â¢ S$fc!s2fr*SSafc?*<Â£Â£$
Mr. Benson Is a genial gentleman, whose
personal qualities have endeared him to
all : his associates. His views on every
question bearing on land ' surveys, .titles,
forest reserve rights and scrip of all de
scriptions are regarded as authoritative,
and his counsel is. therefore sought by all

Computation Made by State Mineral

Some Possibilities.
More important than the area In which
bitumens indicate the possibility and
probability cf finding petroleum. Is the
consideration of the possible richness of
the oil sands. Here, once more, an of
ficial opinion is given, that of the State
Mineralogist:
"The interspaces in a cubic foot of sand

This is the season when a-ssessment
work is required and in the Sunset dis
trict much of it is started. In order to
hold Us claims, one company is about to
erect twenty-five derricks and another
company Is getting ready to run a water
pipe line which will cost some $1800, ful
filling the requirements of the law on
eighteen quarter sections. Â¦

In San IMego County thousands of acres

other company has 10,000 acres and several
other* are after a portion of the territory.

Oil in San Diego.
November gained over October in the
matter of number cf wells that were com
pleted, and the estimated advance over
the preceding month was over 1400 bar
rels. Of course there were failures. Not
every one can expect to strike oil every
time in any oil yielding section of the
world. The percentage wa3 not large for
the failures In proportion to the number
of new wells opened and completed. The
list of counties that are now pro'duclng oil
or searching for oil are as follows: Hum
boldt, San Benito, Fresno. Kern, San Luis
Obispo, Santa Barbara, Ventura. Los An
geles, Riverside, San Mateo, Monterey.

Professor Watts also mentions the fol
lowing facts in one of his papers:
"The geological formations yielding pe
troleum in California range from the
lower cretaceous to the quaternary; and,
in different localities, the geological hor
izon of the producli%-e ntrata' differs in
point of vertical range. In the Puente
Hills and at Los Angeles the oil-yielding
rocks are of Noecene age; these forma
tions were first classed as Pliocene, on ac
count of the numerous Pliocene fossils
found in them.
"On the south side of the valley of the
Santa Clara River, in Ventura and Los
Angeles counties the principal oil-yielding
formations probably range from the Neo
cene to the Miocene.
"On the north side of the valley of the
Santa Clara River, In Ventura County,
there is evidence of petroleum in rocks
ranging from the upper .Neocene to tho
lower Eocene formations; the productive
formation ranging from the Miocene to
the uppermost portion -of the Eocene. .
"In the foothills west of Bake.rsfield. In
Kern County, petroleum Is found in for
mations ranging from the Eocene to the
Neocene, and heretofore classed as Plio
cene; but the oil-yielding formations,
which have been tested by drilling, arc
supposed to be of Miocene age.
"Natural gas and oil have also been ob
tained in the foothills of the Sierras, east
of Bakersfield. the formation being either
cf Pliocene or of Neocene ape.
"In Fresno County and Kings County
there are exudations of petroleum from
rocks of Miocene age. but the petroleum
yielding formation near Coalinga. in Fres
no County, which has recently proved very
remunerative, appear to be of Eocene age.
The geological horizon of the oil yielding
rocks at Moody Gulch. Santa Clara Coun
ty has never been determined. Some oil
has also been obtained on the Tunltas
and the Purlssima creeks, in San Mateo
County, from wells which penetrate strata
which' are probably of Eocene age. North
of San Francisco petroleum yielding for
mations crop out along the coast at Boll
nas Bay and at Point Arena. At these
places the exposed rocks are either of
Pliocene or of Neocene age. In Humboldt
Countv several wells have been drilled
from which some oil has been obtained,
the rocks penetrated being either of Plio
cene or of Neocene age. On Bear Creek,

"Nearly all the oil fields which at this
writing contribute to the petroleum pro
duct of California are situated below the
seventeenth township line south of Mount
Diablo. The productive oil fields in the,
portion ofHhe State referred to are dis
tributed as follows: In the .foothills of
the Sierras near the eastern extremity
of the San Joaquin Valley; on the east
ern slope of one of the coast ranges
which forms the western boundary of the
San Joaquin Valley, and in other localities
of the coast ranges which traverse Santa
Barbara. Ventura, Los . Angeles and
Orange counties.
"It must not be supposed that the oil
vlelding formations are confined to tho
localities enumerated, for they constitute
a large portion of the mountains compos-
Ing the coast rango system. Moreover,
in many places they form the bedrock be
neath the alluvium of the valley land. It
does not necessarily follow that wherever
these oil-yielding formations are found
they contain oil in valuable quantities any
more than coal-measures always contain
valuable beds of coal; but It is a reason
able conclusion that there are in Califor
nia numerous area3 through which 'these
formations extend wherein. new oil fields
will be discovered. This conclusion applies
not only to the portions of California de
scribed in this bulletin, but also to a
large portion of the State -which lies be
tween the foothills of the Sierras and the
Pacific Ocean."
will hold one and one-half gallons of
petroleum oil; a volume of sand equal
to an acre and one hundred feet in thick
ness will hold, in round numbers, 6,600,000
gallons of -petroleum, or 167,005 barrels, so
It is possible for a smallâ very smallâ
area of oil territory to produce a large
amount of oil."
An application of this may be made
when the area of tho Kern River district
is estimated by Mi. Cooper at fifteen
square miles and the oil sand is found by
him to be one hundred feet thick there.
There is in press a work by Professor
"Watts cf the State Mining Bureau on the
petroleum industry in California in which
he reviews the leading geographical and
geological facts thus far ascertained con
cerning the occurrence of petroleum In
California and also' the character of the
oil-yielding formations and their relations
to one another. He writes in part as fol
lows:
In Cplusa County, gas and oil are found in
rocks of cretaceous age. It Is reported
that in some .places petroleum is found
permeating eruptive or other crystalline
rocks. At Stockton, in San Joaquin Coun
ty, natural gas is obtained in remuner
ative quantities from wells permeating
strata of quatenary age. At Marysvllle
Buttes. In the Sacramento Valley, natural
gas is found in rocks of Eocene age. There
are several places in the Sacramento and
San Joaquin valleys where wells are yield
ing sufficient natural gas to be of local
value. v

the greatest development h?s been north

area of oil-bearing territory than has yer

The general opinion of ail observers who
have considered how the original bounds

the industry is. as has so often been re

r.aturally that when all the oil has been

for that purpose. But It Is difficult to set
any time at which exhaustion of the sub
terranean wealth may be accomplished.
"There are wells in the southern portion of
California that have been pumping con

rough but approximately correct estimate
is that the output of these wells this year
will amount to 3.000,000 barrels, or three
auarters of a million barrels more than

THE development of crude oil in the State of California is no longer
an experiment. It has been demonstrated that petroleum exists in
large quantities in many parts of our^ State, and at this time.it looks
as if. the development and production of oil would overshadow, every
other industry in the State of California.,
OIL CITY and the adjacent territory, situated near Coalinea. in
Fresno County, California, and especially Section 28, lying adjacent to ,
Oil City, is too well known to need more' than to call the attention of the
reader merely to its location. It is now a well-known fact that Section
28 is at this time one of the best, if not the very. best*, oil producing sec
tions in the State of California.
SECTION 28: The- Independence Oil Company, which was the pio
neer in developing this Section; has forty acres of land and now has four
producing wells and the fifth in oil, is now shipping in the neighborhood
of 300 barrels of oil per day. The "28" Oil Company, also in this Sec
tion, has three producing wells. The Oil City Petroleum Company, also
located in this Section, has three producing wells, and each of above
mentioned Companies is pushing the /work of development with all pos
sible speed, and \vithin\twelve months from now without a question each
of said Companies will be producing not less than 1000 barrels per day.
It has been demonstrated beyond doubt that "underlying the whole of
Section 28 is an almost inexhauM'ble supplv of petroleum.
THE CALIFORNIA ROCK-OIL COMPANY, to which we desire
to direct the attention of the reader, controls 80 acres of said Section 28.
location of which can be determined by reference to map herein. The
Company began to develop this territory about the first of Tulv. 1000. and*
in October struck the first oil sand at. 1030 feet depth, which proved to be
as prolific as any first strata of sand encountered on said Section. The well
is now being finished, and the Company expects at an early date to have
a paying output from Well No. 1. > Â¦;..â¢Â¦
PIPE LINE: As an evidence of the enormous output of oilfrom
Section 28, the Union Oil Company at an expense of more than $30,000
built : a four-inch pipe line running from the center of Section 28 to Orb
Station, the nearest railroad point to said Section, and large tanks of oil
are daily emptied into this pipe line and conveyed to the railroad sta
tion, where other large tanks are located to .receive the oil. from .which
it is conducted into oil tank cars.
BIG PANOCHE AND CONTRA COSTA "DISTRICTS: The.
Company also has other territory in other oil-bearing sections of the State,
the most prominent of which are 700 acres in Big Panoche District. Sa f Â«
Benito County, and 80 acres in Contra Costa County. These latter prop
erties it is the. intention of the Company to hold for the time being,
while devoting all its time and money to the development of its territory
in Section 28.
AN EXCELLENT INVESTMENT: The Company has already
expended some $15,000 in building roads, buying machinery and casing
and drilling Well Np. 1. It is the intention of the Company to sell a lim
ited amount of stdck in order to continue tl*c ; development work, and
this stock for the time, being is sokl to the present stockholders and out
siders alike at the low price of 20 cents per share.
The Company having at this time passed the experimental ; stage,
purchase of this stdck mav be regarded as an investment and.' not as a
speculation. Its lands in Section 28 are proven/as oil bearing lands, and
expenditures on same will in a short time produce solendid returns. Par- â¢
ties desirous of investing in oil <tock would do well to consider' the fore
going facts and invest in a company that has! proven lands, thousands
of dollars^ worth of machinery and well casing and a well already over a
thousand'feet deep and in oiKsand. rather than speculate in some oil
company that. is still htit "on paper."

As shown by the map, the Company controls over

Francisco and within easy reach of tide water.
The Contra Costa Oil & Petroleum Company are
very much elated over their prospects, and should they
strike oil in paying quantities it will give an impetus to
the oil business of this State which can scarcely be con-
ceived of by the most sanguine.
There are now fifteen or twenty companies who
are doing development work in this district, and any
one of them may make a strike at any time. The Contra
Costa Oil & Petroleum Company, whose map and hold-
ings we print in this issue, are making rapid progress in
their development work. At a depth of 350 feet they
struck a strong flow ot gas and which has continued to
increase in volume as the drill goes down. At this writ-
ing the company's well is down 450 feet, and they are
now in a blue shale which seems to be identical with the
shale formation encountered in Section 28,. at Coalinga.
and which would indicate that underlying this shale will
be found oil deposits.
Contra Costa County is looked to now as being one
of the most probable oil sections where actual discov-
eries in paying quantities have not been made, but from
every indication it may not be long until a new oil dis-
trict will be opened up in Contra Cpsta County that
may surpass anything yet discovered. Some of the best
experts have asserted that there is every indication of
large oil deposits along the Eastern Range of foothills
in Contra Costa Count v.

discoverer. It was known that there were
oil seepages along the banks of the Kern
River. E'.lwood Dored & water well ani
eoon came to oil. There is a fertile spot
surrounding the place where the discov
*-ry was made and a family named Means
lived .on this for years. Soon after the
discovery the property was sold for $30,
000 and the work of exploring for oil was
fairly bfjrun. Investigation determined
that there were thousands of tries in the
vicinity, -within a radius of a few miles,

The work of development was begun in

the work went into the township adjoin

oil,' but the number of successes was so
much greater than the failures that the

did not find it alluring ; until after the
Kern River discoveries had demonstrated
the richness of Kern County in mineral
oil. In 1839 Jewett & Blodgett began to
exploit for oil largely. In a general way
thft district resembles the Kern River dis-
trlct more than it does the McKiurick.
The oil men think that there are but
slight breaks in the belt of oil sand be
tween the Sunset, McKlttrlck and Temb
lor. One concern in the Sunset district
has twenty wells producing, one of
which Is a spouter. The principal diffi
culty connected with the district in the
lack of railway accommodation. All sup- :
plies and material are hauied twenty,
miles. At least fifty companies are
operating In the Sunset field. The boun
daries are uncertain.
The Temblor district has the appearance
of an active field, but has not yet become
a producer to any large extent. It lies
some miles from the railroad. One com
pany claims to have a 200-barrel well in
the district. This is another new district
which had several disadvantages to con
tend with at the outset, the principal ones
being lack of transportation and lack of
water.
The Midway field Is between the McKit
trlck and Sunset fields. Companies are
there. It is a new district. Railroad facil
ities are needed and are hoped for In the
near future.
The McKittrick field was originally
opened, like the Sunset district, for Its as
| nhaltum. and a branch line was built in
by the Southern Pacific Company to car
ry that product: The oil excitement of the
Kern * River district discoveries caused an
Influx of prospectors for petroleum. Fine
wells were developed, bringing up the
daily product, as estimated, to five car
loads. The railway company has found
enough business in the district to compel
a daily service In lieu of a weekly train
service. Milton McWhorter has the credit
of drilling the first successful well in Mc-
Kittrick.

DERRICKS ARE ARISING IN THOUSANDS
MARKET IS ASSURED
FOR TOTAL PRODUCT
Supply of Cheap Fuel Is Causing Change
in Manufacturing Establishments and
Also in the Furnaces of Locomotives.
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 16; > 1900. .
THERE are several leading
considerations that assure a
steady market for all the pe
troleum that can be produced
In this State, which is a fact
of importance to the oil pro
. ducers. One Is that the great
â¢ railway companies doing bus
iness. in this State are transforming the
locomotives on their iroada to use oil in
their furnaces instead ' oi coal. Another
is that there are many large^tpanufactur
ing concerns" that are taking the same
course to supply power. There arejarge
refining plants on the shores of San Fran
cisco Bay and elsewhere In the State
where oils that are adapted to U9e lor H-"
luminants arc treated.
A comparison of the consumption of fuel
oil with that of coal shows that 3.22 bar
rels of oil are equivalent to one ton or
good imported coaL Figuring oil at U 40
per barrel and coal at $7 50 per ton in San
Francisco, it shows the. cost of oil to be
J4 66 as against $7 50 for its equivalent In
coal. Moreover the labor required to op
erate with coal Is far greater than with
oil, In most cases being nearly double.
The perfect cleanliness of oil fuel ana
the ease and simplicity of supply and
regulation make It a most desirable sub
stitute for coal. As long as coal remains
at $7 50 per ton in California, it cannot be
expected that oil will fall far below its
present price, at least not for some time
to come.
In the year 1S99 there were imported
Into the State of California 1.740.027 tons
of coal. To supplant thl9 6.794,278 barrels
of oil will be required. As the supply be
comes greater the uses of fuel oil will
also multiply and coatinually Increase the
demand for the fuel. -Â¦

or Wack had committed suicide Is not

It has been said on account of the low

by Berwln & Gassner It cannot be first

The personnel : of the association Is a

president. Is Captain. Oliver Eldridge; vice
president. Charles Page: , secretary and
general -manager, William- Corbln. Aside
from -.those \ named \ R. \ T: Harding' <und' G.
Howard Thompson are directors. To then
conservative course the success of the as
sociation in j recent years is principally
due. -.../.* .,:.;::......:,...Â¦ i f
The experience of thousands of home
builders in the past fifty years has been
crystallized and the best results incor
porated in the system under which the
Continental transacts business. It does
business for Its members just as
a bank does business for the ben
efit of its stockholders. Member
ship in this association means compul
sory saving of money and consequent
profit to the saver. This object is only
accomplished through the aid of a saving
and loan Institution which requires of the
depositor a stated deposit at regular in
tervals. The amount may vary according
to the Income of the depositor, but no
matter how small, it Is laid by each week
or month' untlWtt assumes proportions as
tonishing to the depositor. Five dollars
per month in the Continental (dues on ten
shares, par value $1000) will double Itself
in about eight years and four months.
Owing to the careful Investment of funds
the Continental has made larger dividends
and matured more stock than any similar
association in the State. In fact, the as
sociation has achieved such a remarkable
degree of success that it is to-day consid
ered a standard on questions of financial
co-operation.
These figures show that the Continental
Is a highly prosperous and stable concern.
Its funds are loaned only on productive
real estate on a basis of 50 per cent of
appraisement, or on stock of the company
to the amount of 80 per cent, and every
dollar of the funds is held by the trustee,
the California Title Insurance and Trust
Company, in trust for the benefit of mem
bers. The mortgages also are held by the
trustee for the benefit of members, and
every title on which the company loans
money Is examined and guaranteed by the
trustee. In this way absolute protection
is assured the members of the association,
and for the additional reason that the
members' money is in 'the hands of the
trustee on a first mortgage security. The
one being a check on the other, unques
tioned protection Is assured.
Chief among the more celebrated con
cerns of this kind in California is the Con
tinental Building and Loan Association,
the home office of which Is at 222 Sansome
street. The association" was organized
July 17, 18S9, and its operations since that
time have been gigantic. Its assets to
day reach the stupendous figure of $1,900.
000, while Its subscribed capital stock ex
ceeds $11,000,000. The profit and reserve
account -amounts to $250,000.
With the advent of the building and
loan associations Into the domain of do
mestic life the conditions that confront
the sagacious famiÂ»y man have suffered a
radical change. Under the system em
ployed by most associations it is now pos
sible for homeseekers â¢ to secure a home
on monthly payments wTiich do not ex
ceed In amount the Eums ordinarily dis
bursed as rent. Thousands of families are
now ensconced in their own dwellings
without fear of the future merely be
cause they adopted the wise plan of be
coming shareholders in institutions of the
kind mentioned. i
To the man of family who is seeking to
provide a home for his wife and children
the question ot "How to do it?" Is a
highly important one. Compelled for
years to pay rent for the privilege of
having a shelter over his head, he makes
the discovery that while he enjoyed the
temporary benefits of a home for a period
of years he has nothing to show for his
outlay. Meanwhile the wage-earner has
pa83ed Into the eete and yellow of his ca
reer, and at his death the only outlook
for his destitute widow and children is
humiliating eviction and suffering,

LONDON. Dec. 15.â Lord Kitchener
reports that eighteen officers and
555 men are missing from General
Clements' force. They consist of
four companies of the Northum
berland Fusiliers. Judging from the mes
sage these were captured by the Boers.
Clements' casualties on December 13
amount to live officers and nine men
killed and many apparently wounded.
Lord Kitchener's message to the War
OlHce is as follows:
"PRETORIA, Dec. 14. â Clements
brought in his force to Commando Nek
unopposed. The casualties were, 1 regret
to say. heavy. Killed, five officers and
nine of other ranks; missing, eighteen of
ficers and 555 of other ranks. These lat
terNvere four companies of the Northum
berland Fusiliers, who were stationed on
the hill, and -some yeomanry and other
details sent up to support them. Names
and nature of wounds are being tele
graphed from Cape Town. Broadwood's
brigade took no part in the engagement.
The Boers suffered severely.
"Knox drove Dewet north to the Tha
banchu-Ladybrand line, which was held
by our troops. Dewet's force, about 3000
ttrcng. made several attempts to get
through Juring the day, assisted by a
force of Boers operating from the north.
These attacks were driven, back, thotjgh
some of ' the Boen from the south were
able- to get. through the line."
Lord Kitchener, under date of December
15, reports to the War Office from Pre
toria as follows:
"Clements has come to see me. He says
thj four* companies of the Northumber
lands held out on the iÂ«i!l as long as tne,lr
ammunition lasted. Â£ The Boer force at
tacking the hill was 2000 strong, while
another force of l'J'W attacked Clements'
camp. By 0:30 a. m. the Mil was carried.
Reinfcrcemerts of one company of the
Yorkshires failed to reach the top. Clem
ents' retirement was carried out with
regularity, but as many native drivers
bolted a considerable amount of transpor
tation was lost. All their ammunition not
taken away was destroyed. He reports
that all beheved very well Broadwood
has gone to Rustonourg and supports
Ollph.ints Nek, which has been rein
forced. A flog of truce which has come
Into Commando Nek for the Boers says
The extent of the reverse and the dis
grace of such a large body of men surren
dering to a small contingent of Boers has
created a feeling of shame and astonish
ment, which finds free vent. With some
what cruel coincidence, the Northumber
lands are known as the "Fighting Fifth."
The second battalion, to which the cap
tured companies belong, was one of i the
heaviest sufferers at Stormberg a year
ago.
x he regiment has often been pronounced
by home and foreign critics to be one of
the finest In the British army. All the
forebodings and criticisms which Colenso
gave rise to a year ago have been resur
rected by the disaster at the Magalles
berg. The War Office has nothing to do
but "grin and' bear It" and trust to time.
General Kitchener's forces are trans
formed into mounted Infantry, and until
the mounted police get to work Mr. Brod
erick Fees little hope of improvement In
the military situation. But whoever was:
responsible for the surrender at the
Magaliesberg is likely to suffer, for the
new War Office officials are determined to
make examples of generals, or any other
officers, guilty of such gross mismanage
ment, or worse, which it would seem,
must have occurred at this last defeat.
This stern attitude on the part of the
Government, however, by no means de
creases the seem and ignominy with
which certain of the Liberal members of
Parliament, who are avowedly pleased by
the Boer successes, are regarded by the
major part of the community. At a pro-
Boer meeting Friday, at which Leonard
Courtney presided. General Kitchener's
name was greeted with cries of "Villain!"
"This is one of the most' severe reverses
suffered by the British, and it is quite evi
dent the war will drag on for many
months. to come. Dewet is making Eng
land the laughing stock of the world. "We
have 210,000 men in the field, yet we are
unable to protect ourselves from disaster
at the hands of small commandos drawn
from a pastoral population."
Joubert's son was killed and further re
ports their losses very heavy." ,
The astounding and utterly unexpected
reverse of the British at Magallesberg,
the news, of which was broken to the na
tion exactly one year after General Bul
lers defeat at Colenso, ineffectually dis
poses of any hopes that the war in South
Africa is nearly ended and completely
abates the myth that the operations there
were nearly of a guerrilla- nature. As
Mr. Lloyd-George, Liberal, said in the
House of Commons to-day:
Protest Against British Treatment of
Women in South Africa.
LOXDONVDec. 15.â Parliament was dis
missed until the middle of February with
the reading of the shortest of the Queen's
speeches. It was as follows:
"My Lords and Gentlemen: I thank you
for the liberal provision you have made
for the expenses Incurred by the oper
ations of my armies in South Africa and
China."
In the House of Commons the remarks
of John Bryn-Roberts. Liberal, were par
ticularly stinging. He declared that the
British treatment of the women of South
Africa was an outrage on civilization, and
that It was blasphemy to hold Christian
services In St. Paul's in connection with
the return of Lord Roberts while there
.were such proceedings in South Africa.
Mr. Broderlck hotly denounced Mr.
Bryn-Roberts' charges, asserting that it
was criminal to make allegations which
could not be proved, but which, however,
would be telegraphed to South Africa to
increase the discontent existing there.
He held up Mr. Bryn-Roberts to the cen
sure and reprobation of nearly every
member of the House of Commons. These
remarks were greeted with cheers. Mr.
Broderick then repeated that the Govern
ment did not desire to pursue a policy
which would make it more difficult for the
Boers to cease fighting and that the Gov
ernment abided in the declarations of Mr.
Chamberlain. The session was suspended
until 2 o'clock in the afternoon, when
both houses met and were prorogued
The Pall Mall Gazette to-day edltorially
declares 'that such men as Courtney
Bryn-Robertg and Lloyd-George ought to
be put in Coventry and be no more spoken
to by any self-respecting Englishman.
The expedient, severe as It is, Is likely
to meet with approval in all quarters, not
excluding the moderate Liberal journal*.
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the Lib
eral leader in Â¦ the House of Commons,
does not escape criticism for tacitly per
mitting his alleged followers to take up
such an avowedly anti-British attitude.
"Butcher!" "Beast!" while mention of
Steyn and Dewtt elicited loud cheers.

May de Sousa, the young singer whose
sweet voice and pleasing manner have
won. her such great popularity with Or

ville for the operatic stage. She finished
her Orpheum engagement last night, and
will leave San Francisco with the Alice

good fortune to be chosen for a position
no less Important than that of understudy
to Miss Nielsen herself.
Miss de Sousa Is becoming famed as a
lucky girl. Her start in music was secured
in a Chicago rchool of music, in which
she had through good fortune obtained a
scholarship. Recently she was voted the
most popular girl in the Church of the
Holy Name parish, in Chicago, at a parish
bazaar. The prize was a trip to Europe,
a pleasure which she will now defer until
the close of the opera season. When she
does go she will improve the opportunity

Pleads With His Boy, Who Is
Under Arrest, to IMsprove
the Charges Against
Him.
Â¦ -.-.*Â¦Â¦..
H. Benjamin, the. aged auctioneer who
was assaulted by a young attorney
named Edward Shirran on the night of
November 9, Is dying from the effects of
the injuries he received. Last night the
police were notified that he could not live,
and two detectives were at once sent to
arrest Shirran.
Benjamin and another old man named
John Tonguegate, who was once employed
as a clerk in the District Attorneys of
fice, were walking along Market street
on, the night of the assault when they met
Shirran and his wife.
Shirran claims that the two men rudely
jostled his wife, but this Is denied by
.Benjamin and Tonguegate. The attorney
admits that be lost hie temper and struck
both of them, knocking them down. In
falling, Benjamin's head struck against
the stone siaewalk. causing a fracture of
the skull. He was taken to the Receiv
ing Hospital, where he was temporarily
treated and then sent to his home at 511
Xatoma street. Since then his condition
has steadily grown worse. Last night the
attending physician announced that be
could not possibly recover.
Several days ago the son of the unfortu
nate man was arrested and charged with
receiving stolen property. Realizing that
he could not live, the old man last even-
Ing begged that he allowed to see his son
before he passed away. His request wai
communicated to Captain Seymour and he
promptly ordered Detectives Bailey and
Hammlll to take the boy from his cell la
the City Prison to the bedside of his dy
ing father.
A pathetic scene was enacted when
young Benjamin, accompanied by the two
detectives, entered the room in which the
unfortunate man was fast breathing his
last. * . â¢
"My son." he feebly gasped, "tell me
you are innocent and I -will die In, peace.
I know you would not disgrace your poor
old father. Speak up. son. and tell me
your arrest Is a mistake."
The lad's eyes filled with tears, and In a
voice choked with emotion he assured his
dying parent that he had committed no
crime.
"I knew It. son," feebly answered the.
old man. "I " Â»
He then became unconscious, and on the
advice of the attending physician the de
tectives took the heart-broken boy away.
FAIB ATHENIAN CAUSES
ROW IN A LODGING-HOUSE
All for the love of a pretty Greek girl,
recently arrived from the ancient land,
John Rogowski, Inventor and patentee of
a wave motor, 74 years of age. Is at the
City Hall police station charged with as
sault to murder. The woman, who is the
wife of a man who runs a street stand,
complained to her husband that Rogowski
was paying her too much attention. He
laid the matter before the wife of James
Rankln. who runs a small lodging-house
at 11 Silver street, where all parties re
side. .
It was determined to order Rogowski to
move and Rankin went to his room. The
aged inventor locked the door and bid all
defiance. Rankin attempted to climb
through a rear window, when, he alleges,
Rogowski used an Iron bar upon him and
later struck him with a knife. Rankin
was taken to the Receiving Hospital and
treated for a' number of wounds on the

Director Denman is of the opinion that
no new teache-s will be elected into the
schoo'. department for at least three years
He finds that there are now sixteen teach
ers on the substitute list, twenty-five on
the ur.assigned list, twenty-eight on leave
of absence, thirty-one on the unassigned
evening eligible list and seven unasslgned
High School teachers, making a total of
nearly 100 teachers available for perma

service system for the election of teach
ers will not be Inaugurated for some time
to come on that account.
Denman has compiled a tabulated state

WOODLAND,. Dec. 15.â On account of
the heavy showers on Friday, the game of
football between the "Woodland and Va
caville High School teams, which was
scheduled for to-day was postponed until
Saturday, December 22. It will be played
at Vacavllle:
AMONG the many toothsome mor
sels arranged to tickle the fancy
of the Saturday race-going crowd
at Oakland track was the Burlin
fratne selling ptake, at one mile
and a sixteenth, valued at 11000. Hercu-
lean, Wyoming, El Mldo, Lothian and
Wax declined the issue, which left a very
evenly balanced field of seven for Mr.
Caldwell to handle at the post. The track
was sloppy and as it looked to be about
tho number Pat Morrissey had performed
best over In former races the Burns &
Waterhouse horse finally closed a slight
choice over Horton and Malay. ThertA
too. he had Winnie O'Connor up, which
was quite a factor. Dr. Bernays, carrying
103 pounds, looked a promising candidate,
but "Butch" Fisher claimed he was un
able to secure one of the swell riders, so
put VIckery. his stable jockey, up. Vlck
ery does the best he can. but Is no Sloan,
and the Doctor's price touched 10. There
was no apparent demand for Morinel, but
Horton was a strongly touted one, and
turned out a rich disappointment. O'Con
nor, astride Pat Morrissey. had Instruc
tions to go out and shake his field off
from the jump, and he did It, with one
exception. Havilan4 was at his side to
tfce stretch, with the others some lengths
back, apparently out of It. Then the pace
began to tell, and Havlland fell back
beaten, while. Dr. Bernays loomed up a
dangerous contender. A trifle later Malay,
piloted by J. Walsh. Joined Bernays and
a great chase after the leader began.
Vickery could help Dr. Bernays none, and
O'Connor, easily outriding Walsh, put Pat
over the line winner, by less than a
length. In the fast time of l:<8Vi./ Bassin
ger seemed unable to get Horton within
hailing distance of the front ones. The
winner stood a long, hard drive, and hts
victory wa? well received by the crowd,

CALIFORNIANS VICTORS IN
SIX-DAY BICYCLE RACE
NEW YORK, Dec. 15. â Before nearly
20,000 people, jammed to every available
corner of the great Madison Square Gar
den, Harry Elkes of Glens Falls. N. Y..
and Floyd McFarland of San Jose, the
American team, won the six day inter
national bicycle race by a wheel's length
from Burns, Pierce of Boston and Archie
McEachern of Toronto, the .Canadian
team. Caesar Slmar of. Paris and Jean
Gougoltz of Monte Carlo, the French
team, was third, a lap away. The dis
tance covered by the winners was 262S
miles, and seven laps.' this being 104
miles and seven laps behind the record
made by Miller and Waller last year.
Karl Kaser of Berlin and Fritz Ryser of
Berlin, the German team, were given
fourth place with 25S6 miles and four laps
to their credit, .they having retired from
the track about two hours before the
close of the race, being satisfied that they
could not possibly cover the forty-two
miles and three laps that lay between
them and_the leaders. Michael Frederick
of Paris and Jean Fisher of Paris took
ilfth place with 2532 miles. They drew
out at 7 o'clock :to-night.\ Frank Waller
of Boston and W. C. Stlnson of Boston
gave up Just before 3 o'clock, this-morn
ing, content with the sixth position and
their 230S miles and one lap. O. V. Bali
cock of New York and' Louis Glmm'of
Pittsburg, who after an accident to their
partners rode for an Individual score,
were requested by the management to
withdraw from the tratfk this afternoon.
Babcock was then at 1506 miles and one

Hares at Union Coursing Park Resort
to Clever Tricks in Their Ef
forts to Evade Their
Pursuers. .
At Union Park, .with the great number
of hares -used and kept on hand -for the
coursing events, it frequently happens
that some of the jacks beat the dogs to
the escapes and thereby gain a respite un
til the next meeting:. Between stakes the
Merced pests are turned loose in the big
field for exercise and to become accus- '
tomed to the escape holes. â¢ ,
In the rundown of the big open stake
yesterday two of the" hares which were
called into play, judging from their dis
play of cunning and. cleverness, had seen
service in many events and knew how to
use their experience to advantage. Hon
esty and Echo were slipped to a long
hare, which slowed a bit and seeing his
pursuers making rapid strides toward him i
spread Itself flat on the ground and al
lowed them to go bv him. The hare was
soon up and after following the unsight
ed xlogs a short distance made a bolt for
the escape unmolested. '
Another hare in the lead of Kanaka and [
Lavender, after makingf'a circuit of the
field and overlooking the natural escape,
cleared the fence at the Elipper's stand
by a well executed jump and left the
hounds bewildered.
The finals to-day should be productive of
good sport. Wedgewood and Floodgate
are the best at the top of the card, with
the former as the choice. To pick Palo
Alto. Chicago Boy and Royal Union on
the lower half with Reilly's dog favorite,
looks like good figuring. For the final
Wedgewood to beat Union is in favor gen
erally. If the going .suits him Wedge
wood ought lo fulfill predictions, though
he is against Honesty in the second, and
as she is running well thÂ« victory will not
be an easy one. Forest King and Tom
Hurlick look to be good outside chances.
Other probable winners in the- second

Motorman Kelly Driven to Suicide by Inability to Effect a
Reconciliation With Mother of His Children
There was no father loved his wife and chil
dren better than I did, and to live In this
world without them i* more than I could stand.
Pearl, I begged of you tojrive me one more
chance, but you would not do it. This Is too
bad that it's come to this. Tell- the children
to pray for me. O, how I did wish to fee
them.. My poor little man. -Papa's boy. . It is
too bad, Pearl, " you put the children against
me. but do the best you can. you never will see
Johney 'again. I have.. been good to you. I
hope you will get along all right after I am
gone. Â¦- 1 want you to 'come and see me after
I am dead and give me your last kiss if you
will. Tell the children I am dead, my poor
little children. .Bury me in my long tall coat.
My Native Sons badge 1Â» on the coat. The
Native Son* will bury me. Pearl, I loved you
to the last, but It was no uie. you never
loved me. -I hope you will pra-y for me.
,Good by, i>j JOHNET.
The other letter was addressed to his
sisters,, Mrs. Mary Ellen Thompson of 309
Taylor street and Lena Kelly. In It he
said:
This is tiro bad, but It had to come to this.
To live^without roy wife and children was more
than. I could stand. I,- love them all. Now.
girls,' I am better off. and don't feel bad for
me. .You done all* you could foe me.
Kelly and his wife did not get along well
together and as the years of their mar
ried life â¢ wore on the tension became
greater and his wife left him five months
ago and took the children with her to San
Jose, where she is at present residing,
conducting a small "notion" and grocery
store. The sisters of the suicide did all
that lay in their power to effect a recon
ciliation between the estranged couple,
but all their efforts were fruitless. The
man was willing and anxious to live with
his wife and children, but the woman set
her face against the proposition.
Kelly was a native of "California; and 40
years old. He was at one time Super
intendent of Streets in San Luis Obispo
and belonged to the Fireman's Associa
tion of that place. After his wife left
him he came to this city* and was broken
in recently as a motorman on the Third
street electric car line. He was a mem
ber of Los Osos Parlor of Native Sons.
SAN JOSE, Dec. 15.â Mrs. Pearl A. Kel
ly, wife of John H. Kelly. \who committed
suicide In San Francisco this morning,
keeps a jjrocery store on South Seventh
street. She claims that Kelly was shift
less and that she had to support him and
her four children. There were besides re-
Hgrlous differences, which were a cause of
constant lnharmony and finally separa
tion. He had threatened suicide before. . ,

BLEEDING PILES
And All Other Forms of This Com-
" ~ mon and Annoying Disease
Cured by the Pyramid
Pile Cure. ,
Thousands of men and women suffer
from some form of piles without either
knowing the exact nature of the trouble,
or, knowing it, carelessly allow it .to run
without using the simple meansof a-, rad-
ical' cure. . : . " â¢
The failure of salves and ointment to
cure piles ;has led many sufferers to be-
lieve the only, permanent cure .to be a
surgical operation*, but '.surgical operations
;are 'dangerous. to life and moreover" very
expensive. and by : no means always or
even often, successful. ,',
The safest and surest 1 way to cure any
case of piles, whether, itching, protruding
of -bleeding, ls to - use the Pyramid Pile
Cure, composed of healing vegetable oils,
ami absolutely free from, mineral poisons
and opiate?. v- Â¦Â¦ \ . .
.Mr." Wm. Handschu of Pittsburg, Pa ';
after suffering Â¦. severely. ; , from- . Â¦ bleeding
piles, writes as follows :-ââ¢',- .
"I take pleasure writing these few llneÂ«
to let you knowthat I^dld nofsleep.for
three months except for a short time each-
night because of a. bad case '.of, bleeding
piles. I was down in bed and doctors did
me no good. V ;Â¦â¢ Â»- f=?-v ; . ..
"A good brother told meof Pyramid Pile
Cure and I bought frorri my druggist three
fifty cent boxes. They.completely cured
Â¦me and I will -soon be able to go to mi-
work again." ' . : . *. . ;
The Pyramid Pile Cure Is not; only the
eafeat and surest pile remedy; but. it is by
far the widest known and -most popular -
because bo many thousands have tried It
and found it exactly as represented.

idence, 2439 Central avenue. Though Mr.
Sevening had been a sufferer for some
time from Bright'a disease, he v was not
thought to be dangerously, sick, and the
announcement that he had passed away
came as a shock to a large circle of
friends. Mr. Sevening recently returned
from Mexico, where he went to look after
some business investments, and only yes
terday afternoon he was enjoying a drive
with his daughters. Late last night, how
ever, he was suddenly stricken, and
though he revived for a time he com
menced to sink again, and at 2 o'clock
this morning his life went out.
Henry Sevening was born in Westpha

1852 he came direct from his German home
to California, settling In.Vorktown. Tuo

ing with Fritz Boehmer, another pioneer
resident of Alameda, with whom ne was
associated for many years. The firm later

DEATH SUDDENLY CALLS
AGED ALAMEDA BANKER
Dreamed of the Banker's Death.
ALAMEDA, Dec. l r >.â Frank' P. Furey.
a Park-street business man and an old
friend of Bank President Henry Sevenlng,
who died this morning, tells a. strange
story cf a presentiment of his friend's
death that came to him Tuesday night
In a dream.
"When I went home that night," said
Mr. Furey "I had a feeling of depression.
After I fell asleep I had a strange dream.
I found mvself In the Masonic Temple
actinp the part of a newspaper reporter.
I was seated at a table taking notes, and
standing about me were all the old friends
of Mr. Sevenine:, among them the most
prominent citizens of Alameda and mem
bers of the Masonic order. They kept ,up
a lowi chanting and 3oon there came a
number of men bearing: the remains cf
Mr. Sevening. which were in a casket. I
could see his face quite plainly and ho
looked just like I've seen him look a
thousand times. After the chanting
ceased a curtain was drawn and then 1
was shut off from a further view. I
awoke after this," but after I got to sleep
again the same dream came back to mo
with a little more vividness. The dream
was repeated three timts."
Mr. Furey says he intended to tell Mr.
Sevening- about his strange presentiment,
but did not see him a grain before his
death. He told Mr. Wever about It the
following morning and the latter remem
tiers all the details, as they were related
to him. ,- \

five of thorn, and their sweet childish
voices made their songs the attraction for
the afternoon. As the faint tones of their
serenade floated eerily down the stairway
every one stood on tiptoe. "Merry, Merry

sang, and jingled the bells as they
marched. As the procession came In sight

The contractors of Alameda County
have banded themselves together into an
organization that they " cail the Master
Contractors' Advisory Council, as opposed
to the .Building Trades Council, which is
the central organization of all of the la
boring men connected with the building
trades in 'this county. At the head of the
new contractors' organization Is A. \V.
Pattiani, who wa3 instrumental in the
formation. Â¦ Â¦ . ' -.
The plan of the new organization is to
keep tne master contractors in all build
ing trades lines in touch with eacn other,
and prepare them to meet demands that
may pe made by the Uuildlng Trades
Council. The organization grew out of the
fact that the Building Trades Council
supported the mtlimen in their recent
i-tiih.e iin.d that all building trades work
men nave rerused to worx upon buildings
that did not recognize the union mlllworit
ers. ;'i
"Our organization represents nearly
every contractor in the county," said Mr.
Patnani. "fully fc5 per cent of the con
tractors employing men belong to our or
ganization, and unless the Building
Trades Council recognizes us we will be
able to prevent any of their number from
securing employment. -It means that
there will be no more strikes*, and the
union men will have to reason with us
now."
The union men say\that they are not at
all disturbed - by anjr .such organization;
that they have no plans for any strikes,
and that there Is no reason for such an
organization as the builders have.
As for preventing strikes the men say
that such an organization would be the
very thing that would cause a strike if
it attempted any force methods. They
claim that they only want union labor
recognized in all branches of the building
trades, and that when this Is done there
will be no danger from strikes.
If it comes to a clash under these cir
cumstances it would mean that organized
contractors or organized labor would be
wiped out of existence.
Contractors Say TJiey.WÂ«rÂ« Forced

There Is No Need
for It.

MR. LAWRENCE E. METER, tains. I
hadn - t much faith In the possibility of a cure
out the result* are remarkable. I h&d been laid
up tor months, but from the day I bogan the
liice method the njpture did not bother me
Tor a minute. It was only a short time when
1 couldn't f>*\ Â»ny trace of where the rupture
liad bÂ»^n and I eoon was Â«.ble to work ell day
Â«>s freely &â¢ a youn* man. I advise every rup-
tured man or woman to send at once and g-et
tl is method as it will certainly cure permanent-
ly and perfectly." Mr. Meyer's advice Is good.
T'pon application to Dr. Rice, he will send you
free a trial of his famous method, and if you
know of aÂ«y other person ruptured have him
? rite also. Euch an act of kindness will bÂ«
t-member*! ft!l the rest of his Ufe. Write to-

ST. LOUIS. Dec. 15.â Five unidentified
men, garbed as tramps, who ; asked shel
ter in the calaboose at midnight last night,
overpowered the village Marshal of
Brighton, 111., locked him in a cell and
then broke into a bank and two stores.
They attempted to get into the vault of
Blodgett Bros.' bank, in which there was
a large amount of money, but were un
successful, although the strong box was
partially wrecked by several explosions of
dynamite.
Falling there, the robbers entered' the
general store of E. Butler, where they
broke into the safe and secured $100. Soon
afterward : Butler's store was discovered
on fire. *. A loss of several thousand dol
lars resulted. 'The robbers escaped on a
handcar. "
."Whenthe Marshal was liberated he or
ganized a posse and started after the rob
bers with bloodhounds. ;-,. :

Th* Financier nays: Through the familiar
operations of a heavy contraction in loans.
which reduced deposit liabilities and thus less
ened cash reserve requirements, the New York
clearing house banks last week neutralized the
efler' of a heavy drain of funds and even suc
ceeded tn adding slightly to their surplus cash.
This showing was unexpected and Instead of
an unfavorable statement the banks- mado a

ThÂ© oata market maintained Its reputation
for bullishness. May closed a shade lower at

Corn was no more inclined to the strenuous
life than its neighbors. The market ruled dull,
turning weak at the close. . May closed Ho

CHICAGO, Dec. 15.â Wheat waj stagnant.
May opened unchanged at 73Â«4c, selling between
73H@73Hc and closing unchanged at 73'ic. The
news received and statistics posted were of. a
character barely sufficient to cause a rippte
on the placid speculative waters. Cables and
receipts were influential neither one way nor
the other. In the absence of Important Infor
mation, therefore, traders preferred Â¦ to- play
even until the passing; of the holiday season
gives them an opportunity to start the new
year untrammeled by contingencies which
mi-jht arise during the Christina*' and New
Year cessation of business. That there Is a
fairly strong undertone to the market, was
made evident to many by the failure of the
market to respond to the corn .decline. Â¦

CLOSING.
American stocks were very buoyant. Pro
fessional traders here responded readily to
New York's lead and prices were high. Chi
cago. Milwaukee and St. Paul was the feature
of the market, the reports of an arrangement
Mtween the Northern Pacific and the Great
NcrthÂ»rn roads being accepted. There was
profit-taking In the Erie issues, but free buy
ing here of the Atchlson shares. Pacific shares
*nl Baltimore and Ohio and Louisville carried
th<Â» day. and trading continued animated in
the street after the exchange closed. This
is very unusual on Saturday. Big buying oc
curred In Grand Trunk shares, in sympathy
with the American department. There was one
order for lO\000 shares of thÂ» first preferred.
Money was very firm on the continued ease
cf foreign exchanges.
This was a bu?y Saturday on the stnek mar
ket, although tha American department almost
monopolized thÂ» interest. The loss in South
Africa, of 570 men. bad a* the news was. was
offset by the report that Dewet was being
closely hammered.
The quantity of French money In London is
very large. Were cireum!=taneÂ»s to arise which
would cause It to be withdrawn, an unpleas
ant position would be created. The indebted
ness to the United States is also great. It is
ln-.probable, however, that New York will call
for goM from London, a portion of the bal
ance in the American Treasury being avail
able. '
NEW YORK. Dec. 15.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The Statist voices the fear that gold may be
sent to tide Berlin over the year, apart from
which the Bank of England's reserve may be
only eighteen millions at the year's end. Justi
fying fe rise in the hank rate. Possibly the
bank, desiring to avoid the advance, will per
mit gold to be withdrawn. It is said the bank
has arranged to part with half a million in
anticipation of the arrival of half a million
from India.
I/ONDON, Dec. IS.â Money was firm, less
plentiful and In moderate demand to-day. An
ticipations of an increased demand next week
harden discounts.
London Market
known that the several financial institutions j
have railed In large special loans of late and
the approach of the January dividend perlod
always brings about a withdrawal of funds
from the market In anticipation of that event, j
It was not anticipated, however, that a liqul- j
datlon so marked would be encountered in a/
stx-day period. The cash changes are about as
figured early in the week. The banks lost
heavily to the Treasury and calls from the
interior were also larire. but on the other han i.
money Is beginning to flow in this direction
again and the heavy losses which have been
noted from week to week give promise of be
ing made up by current recelpU from the
rame sources. The movement tins yÂ«ar has
been extremely heavy. It is thought that
Treasury disbursements beginning with the
coming week will serve to ease the situation,
although no apprehension is felt that the turn
of the year will be productive of embarrass
ment. The present excess surplus stands at
tS.325,375. This, of Itself, is larger than at the
end of ten previous weeks, scattered over the
current year. As a matter of fact, , however,
the excess Is very unevenly distributed, and
on* bank holds In Its vaults more than 60 per
cent of the whole amount. This means that
thÂ« institutions are rot In as strong a position.,;
from the reserve standpoint, as at the close '
o? the last previous week. Circulation Is ex- :
randlng after several weeks' decrease, and rose !
$116,100 for the six daye ending Saturday. ;
Despite anticipations of an unfavorabte state-
Blent, reoney has not shown more than the
usual degree of firmness, and unless signs
usually looked upon as accurate are found tÂ«
be misleading, only unimportant changes will
be encountered. The national banks arÂ« await
ing the call of the Comptroller of the Cur
rency for statements. Or.ce theee are made
the present strain will be relieved in part.

and a ledge eighteen inches wide, believed
PETALUMA, Dec. .15.â There has been
uncovered in. the Sonoma hills Just east
of Petaluma a ledge of coal. Prospecting
has proved that it is a rich deposit and
the find may lead to development of num
erous ledges that, have in the past been
found in the hills and transform the now
almost barren range of hills into rich
possessions. The fact that there was coal
in the district has been known for years,
but it has devolved upon James Mott to
make the first . attempt at development.
Several tons of coal has been taken from
tne s ledge by means of a small shaft sunk
by Mott, and it is now being used in this
city with gratifying results. The fuel
makes a brisk flre and is behind the stan
dard coal only a few points In weight and
durance. It leaves practically no ash or
clinkers. . .

O'Sullivan's saloon was entered by a
burglar, a few nights ago and the change
remaining in the till was taken. He la
now of the opinion that his assailants
knew of this burglary and being confident
that he would not again leave any money
in the saloon, but Â¦would carry the same
home with him, planned to hold him up
and enrich themselves.
Officer Tom Naylor and returning to the
scene oi the holdup by a circuitous route
saw the four men still standing at the

Three of the men succeeded in escaping,
but McGimsey caught one and held fast
until the officer arrived and placed him
under arrest. He was taken to the sta

Four men attempted to rob Dennis
O'SulUvan. proprietor of the Revelation
saloon on Market street, very early yes
terday morning while O'Sullivan was on
his way home. O'humvan was passing
the Murphy building: when he was
grasped rrom behind by two men, while
two others assaulted him in front and en
deavored to wrench considerable coin,
which he carried, from his pockets.
Ju*t as the assault occurred a car
passed the scene of the holdup and
Thomas McGlmsey of Harrington & Mc-
Gimsey. proprietors of a saloon at Ellis
and Powell streets, caught sight of the
familiar figure of O'Sullivan In the midst
ot what he thought 'was a common street
brawl. McGimsey sprang from the car
and hurried to hlg friend's aid. Two of
O'Sullivan's assailants turned on Mc-
Gimsey and after a short but what looked
to be a losing fljfht O'Sullivan and Mc
iximsey managed to break away and ran
down the street In search of an officer.
O'Sullivan's assailants followed a short
distance and then stopped for a confer

The Pacific Coast Steamship Company
sent representatives here to examine the
find and Is now In negotiation' to operate
and develop the mine. Local capita lists
are being Interested In the formation of a
stock company and may develop the
ledge.
Should the mine fulfill expectations it
wnl be a big: factor In the creation of a
factory center here.
Mott's discovery has led to consider
able prospecting: and coal in quantity, has
been found in several parts of the county.
Taylor Mountain, a few miles north of
the Mott place, contains a ledge of yet
unknown quantity. At Glen Ellen and on
the Caldwell ranch at Geyserville lignite
coal has been found.
