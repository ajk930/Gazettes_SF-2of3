Miss Hoffman a Favorite in San

Miss Hoffman first announced her inten
tion of giving up society to become a
trained nurse in July, 1S9S. For three
years. prior to that time she had been ac
tively engaged In charitable work. In so
ciety charity was looked upon as her fad.
She was a constant visitor at the Chil
dren's Hospital, and during that, time It i
was that Ehe farmed the purpose to fit
herself as a trained nurse.
Miss Hoffman Inherited $50,000 from the
estate of Charles Mayne. a life-long friend
of Judge Ogden Hoffman, her uncle. A
j like legacy was left to Miss Alice Hoff
man, who is one of the best of the lady
golf players of the coast, but litigation
kept her out of her Inheritance. Her sis
ter May, with weaith.of her own at her
command, was most liberal In aid of her
; beloved charities. Tall, athletic and
handsome, a perfect Gibson type. Miss
Hoffman ignored the protests of family
and friends, and in October, 1S98, she left
for New York to enter the Bellevue Hos
pital for a three years' course In training
as a nurse.
AÂ» far as her San Francisco friends
knew. Miss Hoffman's enthusiasm for her
chosen work had not waned. During her
visits home since her first departure for
New York there was no hint of any cool

ter of Southard Hoffman of San Fran

enfl the strange coincidence of the disap- j

Mr. Johnson left the sanitarium ten days
Ef?o and came to New York for some pur- i
pose, and alter remaining here for one I
day returned to Watkins. He stopped at
the sanitarium for two days and then
â¢went away, taking til his baggage with
him. He left no address, and his relatives
in this city and elsewhere are wondering |
Â¦what has become of him.
Johnson's shattered health Is said to be ;
largely the result of his duties as one of â¢
the chaplains of the fire department, j
Â¦uhich fcÂ« assumed on March 28. 1SC3. hav- j

Fire Commissioner Rcar.neL Several years j

the lecal fire department of that city. For
two years he slept in the engine house of
the volunteer company to which he be
longed, so that he might be promptlj~-on
hand whenever a fire alarm came in dur- S
Ir.g the night. After leaving Tacoma he \
â¢went to San Francisco and remained there
for some time. He took -with him to that
city several letters Â»of introduction to j
' prominent persons, among them the fam- ;
I!y t of Southard Hoffman, who is one of |
the wealthiest residents of San Francisco :
and who 3s related to the Hoffman and '
McCullagh Miller families of New York.

1 ever, but went to live with her mother.
Soon after Mr. Johnson, whose nervous
ailment had become worse, went to Glen
i Springs at Watkins, by advice of his
j physician. Since that time It Is said that
j Mr. Johnson and his wife have not lived
together.
Almost simultaneously rrlth the dlsap
j pearance of Mr. Johnson f rem the sanl-
I tarium at Watkins comes the discovery
, that Miss Mary Hoffman of San Fran
i cisco, -who for nearly two years has at
j tended the Bellevue Training School for
Nurses, left that Institution very sudden
ly on Wednesday afternoon. It is said that
she went to San Francisco. Mr. Johnson
;paid frequent \isits to Miss Hoffman's
I ward for the purpose of visiting firemen
j patients, and thus was frequently brought
i In contact with Miss Hoffman, and re
! newed a friendship which originated in
i San Francisco. Miss Hoffman, who is

j training school for nurses simply for the
: purpose of gaining experience. She made
i excellent progress, and was at the head

, from her family in San Francisco and
j that she was obliged to leave forthwith
j for that city.
I Miss Brennan said that Miss Hoffman
j did not tell her whether she intended re

"Corporal Herbert Chase of Marlbor
ough, Mass., was shot and killed by James
Henderson, a .private of Â¦ Company C,
Twenty-ninth Infantry, at Catbalogan,
Samar, during the night of October 27.
About 300 American solders held the
town of Catbalogan, being constantly
harassed by the insurgents under General
Lukbon on the surrounding hills. This
led to strict orders to kill all natives out
after dark. On October 27 a rebel officer
came into town under a flag of truce and
delivered over Sergeant Rice and Corporal
Allen of the Forty-third Infantry, who
were captured last March. These men
reported that tha force of Filipinos be
sieging the town numbered 2300, and that
they were boasting of coming Into' the
town to kill all the Americans.
"About 10 ; o'clock that night the Fili
pinos opened a heavy lire on the town. It
was Corporal Chase's duty to reinforce
the gatling.gun squad, and the Filipinos
were tepulsed after a lively half hour's
fight. When â¢ the firing had subsided the
corporal stepped into the bushes, telling
the sentinel, it Is said, not to shoot. The
order was forgotten by the excited out
post, and as Chase started < to return - he
was shot down without beiny challenged.
He was evidently mistaken for a bolo
man. Henderson was put Into the guard
house, and will be tried on the charge of
manslaughter. Chase was buried wilh

(2) contumely, (3) disgrace, (4) loss of

dead than alive, was dragged at the rope's

Firing a parting volley at the swinging
bodies, the mob, eager for another victim,

F. FISHBECK. Notary PublicBERLIN. Dec. 16.-The Foreign Office
officials say that they do not know why
Great Britain has not yet authorized her
Minister at Peking to sign the joint note
of the powers. Sir Ernest Satow has
asked London for further instructions on
the subject. Germany believes the in
structions have not yet been received. It
is pointed out that the signing of the note
will be the first step of a binding charac
ter yet taken by the powers jointly, hence
it is supposed that Great Britain wants
to consider the matter fullv. It Is be
lieved Li Hung Chang and Prince Ching
will be able to show satisfactory creden
tials, and It is assumed they are now com
municating with the court in this connec
tion. The Foreign Office officials admit
that the, indications are now more favora
ble of getting China to come to terms.
They also say the early return of Empe
ror Kwang Su to Peking seems likely.
Private dispatches from Peking say
Lleutenant Count von Wlntzingerode and
Captain von Usedom have, been severely
Injured by accident; that Lieutenant Dus
terberg during 1 the skirmish near Pao

general Fang was captured, with great

While the Ministers in Peking are hag

consolidated her power in Manchuria,
which, under the guise of friendship she
is wresting from her deluded neighbors.

TOPEKA, Kans., Dec. 16. â Santa Fe
trainmen are becoming restive and dissat
isfied with conditions on account of the
risk of running trains. The new men at
many of the block stations are unable to
take the train orders with any degree of
speed, and several cases have occurred
where tho red signal has been thrown
Trainmen Becoming; Restive.
While the representatives of the differ
ent orders deny that there is any likeli
hood of a strike should Third Vice Presi
dent Barr refuse to arbitrate the difficulty
with the Order of Railway Telegraphers,
it is still the general feeling, should this
take place, serious complications might
ensue. The position taken is that if the
Santa Fe refuses to recognize the Order
of Railway Telegraphers at the present
time similar action might be taken should
trouble arise in the future between the
road and other organizations, and It would
mean the establishment of a dangerous
precedent.
But little information could be obtained
from the members of the board of media
tion. They were not disposed to talk
about the situation, but Intimated that
there would be something to give out In
a day or two. The telegraphers feel very
much encouraged over the turn affairs
have taken, an<1 think there is no doubt
of ultimate success.
- "Representatives of the different rail
way orders." said Mr. Mudge. "held a
short conference with myself and Mr.
Ressegule this evening. They stated that
they had no grievance against the Santa
Fe. but at the request of the telegraphers
desired to offer their services to mediate
the differences .between the Order of Rail
way Telegraphers and the company.
"They expressed a desire to act for the
entire system and include the trouble on
the Gulf. Colorado and Santa Fe as well
as the line west of Albuquerque. As my
authority extends simply over the Santa
Fe proper I could not deal with them.
They will probably hold a meeting with
Mr. Barr and attempt to reach a settle
ment upon the best possible basis to be
obtained for the telegraphers."
TOPEKA, Kans., Dec. 15.âRepresenta
tives of the trainmen, conductors, engi
neers and firemen neld a conference this
evening with General Manager Mudge of
the Santa Fe for the purpose of attempt
ing to mediate the trouble between the
road and the Order of Railway Telegra
phers. While no agreement was reached
the board of mediation was encouraged
by Mr. Mudge to hold a conference with
Third Vice President Barr, which will
probably be done Monday or Tuesday at
Chicago.
WICHITA, Kans., Dec. 16.â "The oper
ators' strike In my division, is past his
tory." said Superintendent Tice - of the
Oklahoma division to-night... "Two small
stations are without operators, but not
because we cannot â¢ get men to supply
them. We have agents sufficient for all
the purposes of the stations. Our trains
BOAST OF A SUPERINTENDENT.
"We can bring the Santa Fe to terms,"
said a prominent striking telegrapher to
day, "if we are compelled to. adopt this
method. We have tried it before in Colo
rado and in tho East on the Burlington.
In each Instance we were successful;' as
we ruined the business of the company for
the time being. We have It in our. power
to take away from the Santa Fe practical
ly all its through freight and passenger
business, and we have assurances from
the men on the other roads that they will
act In our interests as soon as notified.'.'
If no agreement can be'reached an order
will go out to all the members of the or
der to route all passenger and freight
business, both from the East and West,
by some line other than the Santa Fe.
Eastern agents Instead of routing Califor
nia traffic over the Santa Fe will turn it
to either the Southern Pacific or the.Union
Pacific. The former, however, will be
given the preference, as the telegraphers
have a very advantageous schedule with
that road. Freight business will be hand
led In the same manner.
The Order of Railway Telegraphers has
about 12.000 members, comprising telegra
phers and station agents on every road In
the United States.
TOPEKA. Kans., Dec. 16.â Should the
Santa Fe officials persist In refusing to ar
bitrate the treaty between It and the Or
der of Railway Telegraphers a systematic
boycott will be sprung by the members
of the order all over the country and an
effort made to bring the road to time by
cutting off Its business.

just as the train was passing. This has
caused the trainmen to be exceptionally
cautious, and in most instances to slow up
when passing block stations, so that then
may be no mistake.
Trains are running nominally on time
to-day, although several were irom fifteen
to thirty minutes late, due to stoppages
along the road for block station signals.
"This thing is grating 1 on our nerves,"
said a trainman to-day. "We can never
tell when the board will be thrown against
us. We want to fp> the difficulty settled
for our own safety." *
ARDMORE, T. T., Dec. 16.â At Dough

smashed the. Santa Fe station windows
with stones and fired on the new operator.
Marshals who were protecting the building
exchanged several shots with the miscre
ants. No one was hurt. â¢
FIRED ON HEW OPERATOR.
"It is all nonsense. No one knows bet
ter than the trainmen that there Is noth
ing in the operators' strike â not even the
semblance of Justification. I am in very,
close touch with the trainmen of my divi
sion, and to me the claim that they are
seriously in sympathy with the Order of
Railway Telegraphers* strike is superla
tively absurd." /
are coming In and going out In better
shape than before the strike. In most of
our stations operators â as we have found
out slnce,the itrlke beganâ are more of a
convenience than a necessity. Many of
our old operators, say 90 per cent of them,
would like to come back, and a great
number have asked to come back, but it is
out of the question. In many places, es
pecially at the smaller stations, they are
securing the signatures of patrons of the
road to petitions praying for their rein
statement. The only trouble we are ex
periencing from the strike now Is the
clerical time sacrificed in receiving appli
cations for .reinstatement. We have a
strikers' file In my office, and I will say
to you in all candor that it is the biggest
file -we have at present. The statement
Issued by the strikers that my special was
tied up in Oklahoma for lack of operators
is absolutely false. I had no trouble
whatever and ran on time over the divi
sion; so did the regular trains."
"What about trainmen;, do you expect
them to strike?" Mr. Tlce was asked.

PEKING, Dec 16. â Definite instruc

munication from London,' have been ro
celved by Sir Ernest Mason Satow, the
British Minister, and he now demands a
modification of a point in the joint note,
which the foreign envoys generally re
gard as important. This means further
delay, as all the Ministers must com
municate anew with their respective gov
ernments. Just what Is the nature of
the objection raised by Great Britain the
Ministers decline to say, but they ad

and senile debility. He goes to the hos

than become a burden upon his children.
The case is a pitiful one and Is exciting
much sympathy hereabouts. Jones was
at one time an inmate of the Yountville

the "army canteen system" as practiced

that by the agreement of November 15 the

all differences had been settled and that
their checks had been made out on the

SAN JOSE. Dec. 16.â Consul General
Ho Yow. representative of. the Chi
nese Government on this coast,
casts doubt upon the claim of
rtf;,* Fred Weitzenberg of Campbell
that the great seal of the Chinese em
pire is In the latter's possession. YVeitz
enberg's account of his visit to. the for
bidden city, printed exclusively over his
own signature in The Sunday Call of
November IS, was as romantic as the
legend of Aladdin. He was with the
United States troops en their entry into
Peking- Not being an enlisted man, he
devoted several days to a search for art
curios and treasures. Penetrating to the
very heart of the imperial city he carao
upon what he believes v.as the keeping
place of the great seal. Here he picked
out what he supposed was the great seal,
selecting It Irom a collection of articles
any one of which was worth a fortune in
itself. This ne now lias at, his home in
Campbell. As proof of his story he ex
hibits a beautiful olocn of green jade en
graved v.nh Chinese characters. The
stone is about four inches square, sur
mounted by a handle shaped after a
uragoii. Tnis last ornament alone de
noies that it t>eioi!tjeQ to tne royal house
hold
Consul Ho Yow admits this much, but
no more, and declares positively that it
cannot oe the great Chinese seal. He
also says A\ eitnenoerff would have no
wav or Knowing the seal.
\\ euzt-nberg is confident he Is right,
and believes that tne fact that the seal
is in his possession is the real reason why
edicts issued since the Emperor has lelt
Peking nuve not been engrossed with it.
He values it highly, and expects to ob
tain a fortune lor its return to the Chi
nese Government. Â¦
Consul General Ho Tow Is of the belief
that the great seal is with the Emperor
and his retinue in the interior of China.
"If Weitzenberg gained access to tha
imperial palace, as ne claims," said the
consul, "tie may have obtained one of
the seals belonging to the royal family,
but it certainly is not the great seal of
China. That is the last thing the Emperor
would part with. It means his life, his
office, his authority, and he would not be
so tocllsh as to leave it behind when he
tied from the allied forces. All the mem
bers of the Emperor's household have
seals, as do all the gentlemen of China,
and it is probably one of these private
seals Weitzenberg may have obtained.
The great seal is one of the most care
fully guarded treasures in the Chinese
empire. The keeper of the seal is a high
and responsible personage. There are
guards continuously stationed about It,
and these are changed very often, so no
conspiracy could be hatched. If the great
seal is lost or stolen off comes the Keep
er's head, and you may rest assured ho
keeps a careful lookout for it. "When the
Emperor left China the seal undoubtedly
went with him, and the keeper of the seal
is in the Emperor'6 suite. By capturing
the Emperor and his party one might get
the seal, but when the whole court haÂ»
escaped you can depend upon it. the seal
is with them.
"If the seal has a dragon on the handle
It Is from the royal household, but that
Is no indication that it is the great seal.
The Empress Dowager, the princess of
the royal blood and the Emperor have
private seals. The dragon means royalty.
It may be an office seal Weitzenberg has,
or one of some of person of royal blood.
"It would be Impossible for Weitzenberg
to tell whether it was the royal seal or
not, and it would be impossible for him
to find the way to where it is kept. Not
even the Prime Minister or any of the
royal princes would know where the seal
is kept and could go to the spot unless
conducted there. v
"No, I do no,t believe "Weitzenberg has
the Chinese seal. Any number of seals
are made of green jade. He may have
a collection of clothing and trinkets from
the imperial Palace, but there are wagon
loads of these and they might be easily
obtained."
Ho Yow said the less of the great seal
would make little difference in the work
ings of the empire. An edict could be
issued announcing its loss and another
would > be made. He said if Weitzenbertc
had the seal it was not worth more than
its value for the stone, and he need not
expect the Chinese Government to pur
chase it.
Weltzenberg*s account of his wander
ings in the Chinese capital, as he gave
it to The Sunday Call graphically /de
scribed the events leading to his obtain
ing possession of the supposed great sea!.
For one whole day this Californian had
the forbidden city to himself; free to walk
where he pleased and take what he fan
cied. Peking was full of sharpshooters,
who hid in the roofs and took shots at
all who came within range. The Chinese
and Tartar cities of Peking were thronged
with people, despite the tremendous exo
dus, yet the sacred forbidden city was
empty and silent. Its Tartar masters had
left, but though they had departed, the
fear of them had not. The custom of
The Gneisenau, 'which . 'was built at
Dantzlc in â¢ 1879. was an Iron vessel,
sheathed with wood, and had a displace
ment of 2856 tons. She was 242 feet 9
inches In length and 45 feet 11 inches In
beam, having a mean draft of 19 feet S
Inches and a coal capacity of 400 tons.
The wreck was caused by the vessel
dragging her anchors. She struck the
rocks and sank close to the lighthouse.
The violence of the sea prevented the
rescue of those who sought safety in the
rigging. ;-'
MADRID, Dec. 16.â "WTille the German
training ship Gneisenau was entering the
harbor at Malaga to-day, where she was
putting in to seek shelter from a storm,
she was completely wrecked. Her coni
mander and many of the cadets wei"
drowned. A boat with forty persons in It
left the Wreck and has not since been
heard of. It is feared that It has been
lost; with all its occupants. The Gnei
senau's masts were left projecting above
the water when she settled to the bottom
and many of the officers and cadet*
sought safety In the rigging. Few details
have been received of the loss of the ship.
It Is stated that she was commanded by

ANDERSON TO WIN.
The coming century is going to be a Pacific Ocean
century. The greatest events of its course will occur
in the struggle for supremacy on this ocean. San
Francisco, therefore, should welcome it with more
than ordinary rejoicing.
Some of these forms of marking the close of the
century might be undertaken in San Francisco. It is
too late to organize a carnival, and nobody desires
one, but it is not too late to arrange for concerted ac
tion in street decoration and a general illumination by
night. ;Â»r ;
In Baltimore, for example, we learn from the Amer
ican, the Retailers' Association has come to the front
with suggestions for the celebration, and while these
include carnival features, they might be made effec
tive without that form of parade. They include the
ringing of all the bells in the city, a liberal display of
buntuig, the unfurling of Old Glory on every house
top, the general illumination of all public and com
mercial buildings, certain streets to be given to a car
nival parade, the furnishing of music by brass bands
and such trade displays and transparencies as will be
most fitting on the occasion, with addresses at appro
priate places by prominent speakers.
In some of the Eastern cities there are to be fes
tivals accompanied by street pageants. These we ia
fer will be something like the carnivals which hav
become so common ir all parts of the country. In
others there is to be nothing of that kind, but in place
of it a sort of public demonstration of rejoicing car
ried out upon a scale of greater dignity and magni
ficence than that of the annual celebration.
IZZJROM our Eastern exchanges we karn that con-
I sidcrable preparations are being made for the
celebration of the opening of the new century
in almost all of the larger cities of that section of the
country. . It is recognized that the anniversary shouid
i"Ot be left to such celebration as comes at every New
Year's day with a horn-blowing frolic. Something
more should be done to mark the close of the most
marvelous century of human history and the opening
of one so promising ?.s that which awaits us.

TRADE OF A HOLIDAY CHARACTER.
BUSINESS all over the country continues of a
holiday character. It is still better in the West
and on the Pacific Coast than in the densely
populated sections along the Atlantic seaboard. At
the same time country collections are everywhere re
f orted good and there has been a fair increase in the
holiday trade. The failures for the week were 240.

change and prices declined. Wool remains quiet.
Hides have been easy for some time. Provisions have
chown more tendency to fluctuate of late, but were
somewhat quieter at the close, with not much varia
tion in prices. Wheat continues unsettled, but the tone
seems rather better, stocks at central points being less
excessive and more manageable. Quotations, however,
show little change from day to ddy. >
There was more activity in Wall street and toward
the close of the week the feeling changed from de
pression over the hardening of the money market to
cne of buoyancy and confidence, as the drain of the
tub-treasury on the banks, which had been cutting
into their surplus reserves, was more than offset
by an influx of over $4,000,000 from some mysterious
source. This eased things off at once and an active
buying demand set in. restoring confidence. It was
the theory that this influx of funds was due to the im
pending payment of the Standard Oil dividend, which
amounted to $10,000,000.
A feature of the week was the issuance of a state
ment by the Bureau of Statistics showing that our ex
ports to Germany had increased about $27,000,000, or
sbout 20 per cent, during the first ten months of the
calendar year, while our imports from that country
increased $8,000,000, or over 10 per cent. This s,how
ing is especially gratifying, as it had been feared that
German restrictions on our exports might cause a de
crease in our business with that nation.
The local situation shows very little change. Timely
rains continue to facilitate farm work and inspire the
commercial community with confidence. Collections
sre at least average and there is plenty of money for
fclvent borrowers at regular rates. In fact, the diffi
culty is often to find the borrower, and there are large
blocks of capital available on first-class security. .
Produce and merchandise show little variation.
Fluctuations in the latter are infrequent and narrow,
as usual during the closing weeks of the year. The
markets will probably grow duller from now until the
beginning of the new year, when a gradual improve
ment may be looked for.
CRETAN EXPLORATIONS
y\y>l R. LOUIS DYER of Oxford, who recently
/ \ came from England to deliver the Phebc
* * Hearst lectures in archaeology at the Univer
sity of California, is now assisting in the work of
raising funds to carry on the Cretan explorations in
the town of Knossos and the Dictaean Cave of Zeus.
As a good deal of interest was shown in this work
by the persons who heard Mr. Dyer's lectures at
Berkeley he has naturally turned to us for contribu
tions to the fund. It appears the demand for contribu
tions in Great Britain for various war funds andrthe
Indian famine fund has made it difficult to obtain there
the sums needed for prosecuting the explorations^ and
iÂ« is for that reason American help is asked. The
work, of course, interests archaeologists of all coun
tries and President Wheeler of the University of Cali
fornia has indorsed the request of Mr. Dyer by the
statement: "The Cretan exploration fund is a cause
worthy of all honor and respect." An}' contributions
to the fund sent to Mr. Louis Dyer, care of the
Macmillan Company, New York, will be highly ap
nrccintcd.

POPULAR MAJORITIES.
THE full vote of the States, cast at the November
election, is counted. The totals of States, and of
the Union, are interesting; but the details, the
county and local votes, are surprising. In the North
ern States the reversal of partisan attachment by
counties and communities is marvelous.
The Southern Illinois counties, the Egypt of that
State, which were Democratic from territorial days
until 1896, emphasized this year their reversal of four
years ago. Then for the first time they gave Repub
lican majorities, but now it was expected that they
would return to their moorings. It was believed that
they were influenced in Bryan's first campaign by the
prestige of General Palmer, to whom they had always
manifested the same good feeling they had toward
Douglas. But Palmer was dead before this year's
election and it was expected that with his spell off
them they would again follow the Democratic nam?
and enter the Bryan camp. But they did not.
Wherever, in other Northern States, Bryan had a
lecal majority it was greatly less than the former
party vote. The Democratic decrease and Republican
increase in the vote are more evenly distributed over
the States than in 1896, showing a more general con
viction that Bryan is not to be trusted in the Presi
dency, now or ever. Of course, a considerable per
centage of the changes are permanent additions to the
Republican party, due to conversion to its public poli
cies and its principles. Other changes were made with
a view of killing Bryanism in the hope of a resurrec
tion of the old Democratic party. So there existed for
a long time the "Silver Gray Whigs," who hoped that
the party of Clay and Webster would reappear, though
they knew not in what form it would come nor in
what body it would be clothed. No man can predict
in. what form an opposition may appear nor the point
in the political horizon at which it will rise.
â¢The popular vote is a final verdict on the Bryan
idea, against its leaders and in condemnation of all its
works. The conditions this year seemed more favor
able than ever for the success of that idea, but it
failed â failed worse in its year of strength than in that
of its weakness. President McKinley â¢ received the
largest popular plurality ever given to a candidate for
the Presidency. In i860 Mr. Lincoln had a popular
plurality over Douglas of 491,195, and in 1864 over
McClcllan of 407,342.

OF SOCIETY'S FAIR CHARITY
WORKERS.

In fact, the practice of pensioning is growing apace
in this country and needs a little wholesale restraint.
If we once begin pensioning ex-Congressmen there
is no telling where we will stop. It appears well as
sured the Boutelle bill will pass and the country, in
remembrance of his service and in sympathy with his
great affliction, will doubtless approve the action: but
all the same there will be a demand that Congress take
notice the case is not to serve as a precedent.
There is another consideration. Why should a man
be pensioned for service in Concress? Our Congress
men arc well paid. In the years of the long session
they serve about six months. In the years of the short
session they serve less than four 'months. Thus in two
years they do about ten months' work and receive
$io,ooo. besides mileage and perquisites. On that
salary each of them can live and each can insure his
life if. he choose to do so. It would seem, therefore,
that no just claim can' be made for a pension for Con
gressional service under any consideration.
The arguments against the bill are not so attractive 1
to the. sympathies of the heart as are those in favor
of it. They are the hard arguments of justice. A man
who left the navy thirty-five years ago has no right
to claim equal privileges with those who have served
the nation at sea during all that time. He has had a
chance to provide for his private fortune while they
have not; and it would be unfair to them if he should
now be ranked amontj them as if he, like them, had
remained with the flag steadfastly and had no other
thought than the naval service.
The. sentimental arguments in favor of the plan are
apparent. Here is a statesman who in his devotion to
public duty has neglected to make any provision for
his old age. He is now suffering from an affliction
that threatens to leave him helpless for the rest of his
life. Why should not a rich and grateful nation pro
vide a pension for him?
The facts are these: Boutelle, after a short service in
the navy, left it nearly thirty-five years ago and de
voted himself to politics. His career as a member of
the House of Representatives has been distinguished
and useful to his constituents and to the nation. Re
cently his health broke down and his mind failed. He
has no private income. His constituents re-elected
him to Congress notwithstanding the fact that his
mental state is such as to leave little hope that he will
ever be able to take his seat. It is desired by his
friends that a pension be provided for him and they
have hit upon the scheme of placing him on the list
of retired captains of the navy for that purpose.
AN interesting question, in which sentimental
considerations are strong on one side and jus
tice and precedent are equally strong on the
other, is now before the country for discussion. A
bill is before the House authorizing the appointment
of Congressman Boutelle to the position of captain on
the retired list of the navy, and the question is
whether the passage of the measure would be a com
mendable act of public gratitude or a legislative out
rage.

Mrs. Kerwin, Colonel Girard's pretty,
blue-eyed, dimpled daughter, lies awake
nights, I am told, planning all sorts of
things for the enjoyment of the soldiers.
But she Is not the only one at the post
who is doing that. In the same boat with
her are Mrs. Cochrane, Miss Davis, Miss
Nanle Marshall, Mrs. Gardner of Fort
Black, Mis* Lally, Miss Brown, the
Misses Marshall, Miss Anderson, Mrs. Et
tinge and Miss McFarland.
The ladies of the Presidio have joined
hands with the belles in the splendid work
and the ladies of the Red Cross, as was
to be expected, are doing their share,
too.
1 have never seen the girls take hold
of anything as they have of this fete, that
is going to make the boys happy who gave
their health to their country. The girls
are working like Trojans. They have
bunched themselves into committees; they
have put all their spare money â and
sometimes more than they can spareâ into
the purchase of useful gifts. They have
gone around and asked their friends to
help them be kind. And they have, with
their own fair hands, been making warm
and comfortable clothing for the poor,
sick, brass-buttoned boys. On Christmas
eve they are going out to the Presidio
to gather around a magnificent tree all
ablaze with red, white and blue lights,
and from its generous branches they are
going to gather gifts for all the boys.
After the tree has been stripped, they are
going to break up into happy little
bunches and bring a goodly share of this
world's comforts to the bedside of each
and every poor boy who la either too ill
or too weak to leave his cot. Then they
are going to pas3 around refreshments
and sing and recite and do anything that
they can think of that Is calculated to
make the soldiers glad.
The njrst thought of the charitable has
turned, naturally, to the soldiers. Colonel
Girard was the first to set the kind ball
a-rolllng. He turned It In the direction
of his boys In blue, and I stand ready to
wager that the coming Christmas eve at
the Presidio is going to be one of those
events that help make history.

and belles and matrons are working
with might and main, so that those

SOCIETY: DRESSING AN XMAS TREE
FOR BOYS IN BLUE.
Students of American politics will find much room
for useful study of this situation. No party in our
history has reached such a high mark of popular ap
proval as the Republican party. This was attained in
the face of a fusion and combination of all its op
ponents. Whence is to come the power that can over
throw it?
In 1872 the restrictions on the ballot in Missouri
and other Southern States outlawed from the polls
hundreds of thousands of votes that would have been
cast against Grant, to the reduction of his popular
plurality. Had those votes been cast it would have
been less than McKinlcy's.
If conditions were equalized with the Grant cam
paign of 1872 it would appear that Bryan has-been
twice beaten by a larger plurality than any other can
didate of a great party since the beginning of the
Government.
novelties which appeared in the platforms of Chicago
and Kansas City.
It is to be one of the happiest Christmases this
country has known for many years. There is no rea
son why it should be marred in any way. It will bo
pleasant in every respect for all who keep these rules;
Remember the poor, patronize home industries, and
shop early.
All persons who can do their shopping in the early
part of the day should do so. That is one of the
Christian courtesies of the Christmas season. â¢ Bear
in mind that at the close of day all the host of tired
workers are on their way home, and that there is
barely sufficient streetcar accommodation for their
needs. Therefore all who can get home before the
6 o'clock rush should do so. The evenings should be
left as far as possible to working men and working
women, who, being employed all day. have no other
time in which to do their shopping. Let us make
way for one another. Something of a moral wrong
is committed when persons who can do their shopping
early just as well as not postpone it and then crowd
others who have only the evenings at their disposal.
Finally, do your shopping as early in the week and
as early in the day as possible. The brilliant display
of beautiful things in the shop windows and the won
derful array of stocks advertised in The Call show
that the stores for this week will be as attractive as
any expositions ever held. The temptation to delay
purchasing and to wander from store to store in
search of princely gifts at petty prices will be great:
but that temptation must be put away. Get your busi
ness done promptly. The first comer gets first choice.
That which pleases you to-day may be sold to-mor
row. If you wait to the last you will have to make
your selections in "the confusion of a great hurry, but
now you can use your leisure and choose wisely.
To patronize home industries is the wisdom of
patriotic citizens. In some respects that is even better
than charity, for it encourages self help and thrift
and builds, up industries that, growing from more to
more, will eventually give employment to thousands
and advance our people in all lines of artistic en
deavor. There is no necessity for us to go to France
or Germany or even to the Eastern States of our own
country for Christmas goods. California with her
manifold resources lacks nothing that the heart can
desire in the way of luxury or beauty. The elements
of all good things arc here and all that we need to
do is to encourage those of our neighbors who have
the taste, the talent, the skill and the energy to work
the raw material up into the forms that arc neces
sary to enjoyment. In all the shopping of the week,
therefore, remember that where other things are equal
California goods should have the preference when you
come to make your purchases.
-Few. words will be needed to remind (^alifornians
to set apar,t some portion of the Christmas funds for
the benefit of the poor. We have very little of that
dire poverty found in the older States of the Union
and among the peoples of Europe. Compared with
those of other lands the desolate, homes in California
are few and far between.- It will be, therefore, an easy
task for us to provide a merry Christmas for all so far
as merriment can be furnished by human liberality.
Let each citizen who has been blessed with fair far
tune give a little for the orphans and the poor; and
Christmas day will bring joy to every home in the
State.
There are three rules to be observed in the rush of
the shopping: First, remember the poor; second, pat
ronize home industries, scatter the beautiful products
of California far and wide through the East; third, do
your shopping early nnd avoid the rush of the closing
days.
y~Â»HRISTMAS shopping, has been briskly
1 skirmishing through jhc city ever since Thanks-
giving, will begin in earnest to-day. It will be
a week of joyous bustle and merry business. There
will be a rush all along the streets, and in the stores
there will be jostling and crowding, but there will
be no ill temper in the crowds, for all will be glad
with the spirit of the happy season.

&-Hg-s3 HE case of another lad who would
I be a whaler Is puzzling the police.
1 1 Andrew Young left his home at
II 2105 Bush street last Friday and
has not been seen by his parents
since. Ostensibly he started for school,
but instead went to the water front and
attempted to rhip In the whaling bark
John and Wintfcrop as a cabin boy. In an
swer to the captain's Questions he said he
was 22 years old, but the old-time whale
man was not to be deceived, and ordered
him ashore tp get a written certificate
from h!s parents.
"The boy came to me last Wednesday,"
said Captain Macomber yesterday. "I
asked him how old he was, and he said 22.
I sized him up as being about 17, and told
him he would have to get the consent of
his parents. He said he had no relatives
In the world, and a guardian, who gave
him no liberty, took Care of him. I sent
him ashore to get a permit from his
guardian, and a few hours later he csmt
aboard again with a note signed by* a
Mrs. A. Cox. saying she was willing that
he should ship on the John and Winthrop
for a cruise in the Arctic.
"I was suspicious about the whole af
fair, so I hunted for Mrs. Cox on
Steuart street, and she at once ac
knowledgedl having written the letter for
75 cents winch the boy had given her. As
soon as I learned the state of affairs I put
the boy ashore and told him to go home.
Since then I have not seen or heard from
Dim."
Saturday night the father of the lad was
hot on his trail. He was told by the whal
ers that a boy resembling his son was on
the John and Winthrop. He went to the
harbor police station and secured the Ber
vices of Patrolman Ingham. Together'they
went out to the whaiing bark, but on ar
riving there they found the lad had been
sent ashore two hours before.
To the police the father said the lad was
only 15 years old. but looked 17. He was
crazy to go to sea, the father said, and
added that should a favorable opportunity
arise he would let him go. As cabin boy
on a whaler, however, ne thought there
would be too much hardship, and he want
ed to save him from it.
A number of whalers are now fitting out
for a cruise in the Arctic, and as loung
is determined to make the cruise the
chances are that he will get away on one
of them. Every boat on which he might
have stowed away was searched yester
day, but so far the lad has escaped.
Last evening the lad's parents heard of
him being seen near his home. They are
sure he has not left the city and they are
most anxious to have him home again.
His mother believes he left home because
of a threat to put him In some school
where he could not get away If he did not
attend the public school, to which he was
sent. She says she is willing to let him
go to work if he does not wish to go to
school.
The boy carried papers for a man named

He Will Continue to Represent the
Manchester and Caledonian
Companies Here.
In the story of the deposition of T. J.
Conroy as local manager of the American
Insurance Company of Newark, N. J., as
published in The Call yesterday It was
erroneously stated that Mr. Conroy haJ
also been superseded aa the local repre
sentative of the Manchester and Caledo
nian companies.
The severance of his connection with
the American Company In no way affects
his position as local representative of the
Manchester and Caledonian companies, of
which he will still retain the Pacific Coast
agencies. The new firm of Chrlatensen.
Edwards & Goodwin will represent the
American Company only, and not the
Manchester and Caledonian, as stated

Injured in Boxing Bout
VANCOUVER, Dec. 16.â "Jack" Morri
son, a pugilist, was badly Injured In a
bout here, at the Erwlng Club smoker last
night. He was hit a solar, plexus blow by
Tod Sharp, a local man, and has been in
sensible ever since. He Is not expected to
recover. .
THE barge Washougal with a mil
lion feet of lumber aboard and a
crew of thr^e men is pomewhere
outside. Incidentally the under
writers and owners would give
riir.ethSr.gr to know aer whereabouts.
Borne peoplÂ© think Ehe is lost, others
think Ebe has been blown off shore and
that the crew will starve to death, while
Again there are some who say thÂ« barge
will come along with the next change of
wind.
Tbe Washougal left the Columbia River
to tow of the tug Sampson a week ago.
When the recent gale came up the Samp>
eon broke down and had to cut her tow
adrift The tus was picked up by the
eteaxner Point Arena, and brought Into
port. The last seen of tbe barge she was
making sail and standing off shore, Fri
day the tug Rescue was sent out to look
for her. but during a search lasting twen
ty-four hours, not a trace of her was
found. The Rescue came home yesterday
and people along the front are Ptlll guess-
Ing as to what has become of the Wash
ougal. Ehe is a good, stanch barge and
there Is more than a million feet of lum
ber aboard, eo there la no chance of her
foundering. Still the crew must be on

circles early yesterday morning. Shortly

a nyin and one of his ears had been cut
oft- In the struggle. Sergeant Duke anrl
two officers hurried to the house and af
ter making an investigation telephoned
to police headquarters and two detectives
were soon on the scene.
Simes at first said that an unknown
man had come Into his room and stabbed
him. Then he said that thÂ© man had shot
his ear off. Finally it transpired that
Slmes went home with a bottle of whUky

PALO ALTO did not hesitate. At
the finish of the run-down of any
of the stakes in which Eugene
Geary's great sprinter had won
his first it has become the custom
of the tipsters In picking a stake winner
to name one conditionally, and that con
dition was "unless Palo Alto does not hes
itate and tries to win." While the fastest
son of that great sire Emin Pasha has
burned up many bunches of money by in
dulging in his favorite pastime of laying
off the game when victory was easily at
his disposal, still the desire of the wise
ones to back him on all occasions is ex
cusable. From the slips Palo, Alto can be
depended on to lead any opponent a good
bit, and a repetition of thig course after
course shows beyond doubt that for speed
he Is the king. It is a treat to see him
go up the field, increasing his advantage
until the distance cannot be computed In
lengths.
Yesterday he was out to win and he
showed the way to the fast ones. The
deciding course was full of interest. Har
lean Gladys had earned the right to con
test with Palo Alto for final honors, and
together the hounds furnished enough ex
citement to keep the crowd jumping. Palo
Alto took the lead and scored his total of
six before Gladys got in. Her four points
were for two turns and a go-by, the hare
escaping. The dogs stirred up a stray
jack and continued on for a while. .
Favorites ran well up to form, capturing
the flag in all Dut eleven goes. Among the
The first hare was the educated one
which gave a pair of coursers the go-by
in the Saturday run-down by Jumping the
fence. Palo Alto, with all his speed, was
no match for the cunning hare, which has
been named Gazabo. After taking suf
ncient exercise Gazabo stole quietly to the
haven of safety. The regular patrons of
the park have taken an Interest in the
tricky pest, and have asked Charley Grle
wold to keep a record of his future work.
upsets was the defeat of Wedgewood. the
stake favorite, who was put out by Hon
esty, his half-sister. Cascade reached the
lifth round after beating Connemara
pointless and winning on the short end
from Mamie Pleasant and Tom Huriick.
Brutus did good work and looked to have
a strong chance for a place. A heavy
play was made on him to beat Harlean
Gladys In the fifth. He was choice at
slight edds, but lost the flagâ score 7 to 4,
Royal Union and Ireland were beaten In
the semi-final.

VERSUS EASTERN
NEW YORK, Dec. 16.â The committee
of the Protective Association of Profes
sional Baseball Players, composed of
Hugh Jennings, C. C. Griffith and Charles"
L. Zlmmer, who presented their claims to
the National League magnates during the
week, to-day issued the following state
ment:
"The refusal of the National League
magnates to consider and discuss with us
seriatim our requests as representatives of
the Protective Association of Baseball
Players, and their tailless resolutionâ
which is probably intended to express in
words their complete ignoring of the
said requests collectively, without any
adequate reason therefor â seem to require
us. as such representatives, to make the
following statement to all the members
of our association and to the public:
"And we shall continue to stand, as we
have always stood, tor the avoidance of.
a 'baseball war,' if that be possible.
"We recognize and shall respect the
inviolability of all actual contract obliga
tions.
"So member of our association who
during the past season played in the Am
erican League shall at present sign a
contract to play the present season in the
National League, or vice versa.
"Pursuant to our by-laws, none of the
members of our association shall sign a
contract for the coming season which
has not been approved by our associa
tion."

MOVEMENT OF REALTY IN SAN FRANCISCO.
The first .device, then, of the author has
been to separate the, hero from the hero
ine and- engage our sympathy for the one
as against Â¦ the other. : This plan is ac-
Is as our earinc"
But In this scandalous situation and in
the interchange of fondness which we In
common with the court followers over
hear we detect evidence that the blame
does not belong equally to Rome and
Egypt, and that Antony is not the prin
cipal in the case:
Cleopatraâ "If It be love.lndeed, tell me how-
Antonyâ "There's beggary In love that can be
reckoned." . â .
Cleopatraâ "I'll set a bourn how far to be
beloved." â¢
A woman who solicits devotion In that
unblushing style and In the public ear
must bear the brunt of the general de
nunciation. We are ready to give the hero
more countenance than we at first sup
posed could be won from us. The sus
picion that his fault is chivalrous com
plaisance rather than Inherent sensuality
grows upon us when a few lines later
Cleopatra gibes him Into denying court
audience to the messengers. Cleopatra's
fear lest he give sober heed to his vast
concerns, and her need to use her utmost
control to keep him under, prove that to
her mind he is yet un-Egyptlanlzed and
will vindicate his Roman nature.
In the llrst part of the second scene the
real character of life In Egypt as lived at
the court cf Cleopatra Is painted In full
colors. A leaf from the record of the
days Is enacted to us. The general at
mosphere Is d.eadlv. and Enobarbus. once
a stalwart comrade of Antony's, la suc
cumbing to it. The soothsayer furnishes
the suggestion of higher standards and
nobler living foe the sake of contrast.
Alexas and Iras and Charmlan, nearest
attendants upon Cleopatra, fix the pitch
of the scene. When Cleopatra enters and
bids Enobarbus seek out the Emperor of
all the Orient and bring him to her the
let son Is complete and we are ready for
the next chapter. We are sure that An
tony understands how absurdly he is hen
pecked and will assert his manhood and
his rights.
The moment of change has, in fact, ar
rived. Antony enters with one of the
messengers lately refused audience in
Cleopatra's presence. Antony has sent
for him and is listening to his story with
concern. Antony Is not unaware of his
shortcomings and is ready to take up his
imperial tasks again:
Messengerâ _ ' Â¦ "Lablenusâ
This is btltt newsâ hath, with his Parthian
force â¢
Extended Asia from Euphrates,
Â¦ Mis conquering banner shook from Syria
-To Lydla and Ionia: whilst " -
Antony â "Antony, thou wouldst say "
. . Â¦ â¢ Messengerâ "Oh. my lord!"
Antonyâ "Speak to me home, mince not the
general tongue.
" Name Cleopatra as she is called In Rome.
Rail thou tn Fulvia's phrase, and taunt my
faults
Â¦ With such full license as both truth and
malice
Have . power to utter. Oh. then we bring;
- forth weeds -
When our quick minds lie still; and our ills
told us
"Look where they come!
Take but good note, and you shall seeÂ»ln him
The triple pillar of the world transformed
Into a strumpet's fool. Behold and see'.
his master dotes upon Cleopatra extrava
gantly and fatally:
"Nay. but this dotage of our general's
O'erflows the measure; those his goodly eyes.
That o'er the flies and musters of the war
Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend,
now turn
The office and devotion of their view
Upon a tawny front."
With this testimony of one close to
Antony's person the title characters are
introduced. There Is all the pomp and
ceremony of an Oriental court; there are
eunuchs fanning the Egyptian sovereign:
there is a great train of bejeweled and
unworthy favorites, and Antony is danc
ing attendance in a most un-Roman and
compromising fashion. Philo is made to
serve us as the interpreter cf what we
see:
nature, to prepare for the sublime close.
Step by step he Idealizes the man, and
when the death scene Is passed we feel
that we have had before s us a truly tragic
figure, too highminded and chivalrous for
his times, and cut off because he would
not be niggardly and self-seeking. Had
he been less lavish of himself and of hl3
favors destiny would have had much
more ado to set him aside from the patii
appointed for Its favorite Augustus. -
With act 4 the tragedy of Antony Is
finished. We wonder how the author can
propose to go on to a climax with Cleo
patra In act 5. She Is shown to us In
the death scene in the act preceding In
what we feel Is almost her true charac
ter. She will not come down to the dy
ing Antony lest she be taken: she Insists
on jolting the bleeding body of her lover
up to her arms, though she Is aware of
the pain At causes. But the author finds
no difficulties, apparently, in his new
task. He needs but show us Cleopatra's
nature in its potencies and possibilities.
Reared In another environment she would
have been altogether admirable. Bred
under the corrupt influences of a decaying
civilization, pampered and spoiled almost
beyond example, she is nevertheless grand
In strength and vision. The same quali
ties, in some Christian centuries slnceÂ«
nave enabled women not much better to
wield power far greater. The fear of
death, which has kept her long In bond
age, dissolves In the sublimity of her
dying thoughts. She hears Antony, as she
thinks, calling to her:
"Husband. I come!
Now to that name my courage prove ray title."
She has right Ideals and aspirations
now. never before has she cared to think
of herself as the wife of Antony. She has
thought to die beautiful, with her robo
and crown upon her. But she forgets her
finery and no longer watches herself In
the glass while Iras tricks her out:
"Tare, yare, good Iras; quick. â¢ â¢ â¢
So; have you done?
Ccme. then, and take the last warmth of my
lips.
Fare-n-ell, kind Channian. Iras, long; farewell."
She Is Immeasurably gTeat, now thÂ«.t
her better nature Is aroused completely.
That she should die when she is just
ready to begin to live la of the essence
of tragedy. It Involves deeper tragedy
than the death of Antony, for Antony had
lived hl3 best. We bow to destiny, which
we have felt since Menas failed to move
Pompey. and Octavlus. shaking off the In
veiglements of drink. In the last scene of
act 4, is setting up the empire of the Cae
sars. Dolabella, who was her latest con
quest, stands between Cleopatra's dead
body and her Roman master. The play 13
closed with a few paragraphs of rare dig
nity and beauty. It Is a moral lesson of
deep earnestness and vision, and make?
for righteousness more potently than a
thousand sermons.

Company Greeted With Crowded
Houses in Every City With.
Exception of Lincoln.
NEW YORK, Dec. 16.â Maurice Grau
arrived to-night The stars and satellites
of the Metropolitan Opera Company,
which Is under his direction, are strug
gling through snow and zero weather to
open a season of grand opera at the Met
ropolitan here Tuesday night.
Mr. Grau said: "Our Western trip has
been a most wonderful success, though it
involved tremendous fatigue. The com
pany traveled 8000 miles and gave forty
one performances in five weeks and two
days. In every place we visited we had
nearly the full capacity of the houses ex
cept in Lincoln, Nebraska. It seemed
that the home of Bryan was not big
enough for the Metropolitan Opera Com
pany.
"We took In nearly $250,000. We visited
Los Angeles, San Francisco. Denver. Lin
coln, Kansas City and Minneapolis. In
r.nne of these cities, with the exception of
Kansas City, had the Metropolitan com
pany ever been before. Our receptions in
San Francisco and Minneapolis were
especially remarkable. They all expect
us to re-turn, but that is a question whicn
will require a good deal of consideration.
"Our triD was one of the quickest on
record. We had sixteen cars and 220 per
sons. We traveled in a special train all
the way and most of the time we ran in
two sections. During the last two weeks
we practically lived in the cars."

is a hard-luck story all round. The en
gagement of the Boston Lyric Opera Com
pany at Manager Ellinghouse's theater
called for five performances â three "Car
men" programmes for Sunday, Monday
and Thursday evenings, "Said Pasha"
Tuesday evening and "II Trovatore"
Wednesday night.
But instead of a, glittering "Carmen"
'"Said Pasha" shone out from the Alham
bra's electric sign last night, and a disap
pointed crowd besieged the box office for
explanations for a long and busy half
hour before the performance.
"Collamarini was ill â three doctors' cer
tificates!"
"No, the Tivoli had nothing to do with
it."
"No, she would not be able to sing to
morrow evening or at all during the
week," and so on, ad Iniinltum.
A considerable audience, however, gath
ered inside the theater and amused itself
wondering wnat would happen. Slgnor
Kusso happened along first and explained
in his retreshing dlaiect that:
"Miss Coiiamariiii she was too very ill
to sins, the was much sorryâ per bauco â
but it could be helped not." which courte
ous little explanation was greeted with
discourteous ntsses Irom tne disappointed
ones.
Then a long-lesgcd Turk came out and
read in ur.mistakiiole Kngnsh me doctors'
certificate as to tlie aiva/s serious indis
position, signed by l>rs. M. A. Hossi,
Henry M. llart (.doctor ot the accors
lund) and Gerald J. r'itzgiubon (tne Al
hamora's physician). A lurther interest
ing announcement as to "Manager iiiiing
house's cheerful willingness to refund
their money to those wno were not de
sirous of seeing the substituted opera,
'Said Pasha,' " caused a general stampede
and was greeted with loud cheering. After
the malcontents had taken their departure
a small but sympathetic crowd listened
to a fairly clever presentation of the
pretty opera, in which Charles Hunting
ton, Frar.k Maslin, Henry Hallam, Jack
Henderson, Alex Joel and Josephine Stan
ton were all well heard.
But tlie company will be heard here no
more this trip. "Said Pasha" would not
carry for more than one evening, and the
rest of their available repertoire â
"Wang," "The Fencing Master" and
"The Idol's Eye"â is in the Tivoli's do
main so far as San Francisco Is con
cerned. Manager Ellinghouse will there
fore keep the theater dark till next Sat
urday evening, when "Why Smith Left
Home" will be put on.
Who said "Azzall," him of the famous
hoodooed Italian Opera Company?

A packed house greeted Ben Hendricks
in "Ole Olson" last night at the Califor
nia. The play, which Is said to be the
first Scandinavian comedy ever written,
serves to bring out the talents of Hen
dricks. who is easily the best Swedish
XVII.
"Antony and Cleopatra."
There is an essential difference 'Â¦ be
tween "Antony and Cleopatra" and each
of the other dramas having two title
characters. In "Romeo, and Juliet"' the
hero and the heroine perish together near
the close of the play. In "Trollus and
Crefsida," which is called a tragedy In
the folio, there is no death of either, and
there Is no division in the treatment.
While the whole play may truthfully be
called a tragedy, it Is really not so much
a tragedy of the hero and the heroine as
of human, nature at large. In "Antony
and Cleopatra" there are two tragedies
fused Into one. It Is as if each title char
acter had been treated separately in a
drama by itself, and then, by dropping
common scenes, the two products had
been condensed to the proportions and
form of one. The tragedy of Antony is
consummated -at the end of act 4. The
tragedy of Cleopatra is developed and
compassed almost wholly In act 5.
Mcst readers approach the "Antony and
Cleopatra" with some misgiving. The
relations of the title characters are his
torically so notorious that they expect
to find Shakespeare's treatment offensive
ly plain and free. But the most refined
analyzers of thevplay. after patient ami
penetrating study, testify to impressions
quite contrary and are ardent apologists
for Cleopatra no less than Antony. The
author holds the sympathies of all dis
cerning Inquirers almost from the first,
whereas were the play real and enacted
with living figures it would not be pos
sible to command even the charity of the
reading public. Of course we are leas
intoierant of ""-social derelictions after
death has stopped the defiance to moral
laws. Nevertheless, the play is a marvel
of literary dynamics, and deserves study
In special for the modes by which Its art
controls the imagination.
Perhaps we expect that the author will
allude but gingerly to the relations of the
hero and heroine at the beginning, or will
apologize outright for his project. But
Shakespeare understands apparently that
to excuse Is to accuse, and does just the
opposite. He- makes Philo tell us, over
the shoulders of Demetrius and with
brutal openness, how things are going.
Philo has been living in Kgypt as one
of Antony's companions, and knows:
while Demetrius, an old friend of An
tony's in Rome, and just come over, does
not know and needs to be told. As a mat
ter of fact. Shakespeare Introduces both
personages merely to impajt to us this
information. Neither Philo nor Demetrius
is wanter afterward or appears again.
It is evident that Demetrius, just before
the opening lines, has been objecting to
Philo's unsparing comments; he has prob
ably said that a man like Antony has
earned some liberty and is not likely to
abuse it permanently. Philo Insists that
Before the act ends the author has fas
cinated us with Cleopatra, by her
strength and her variety, much as she
fascinated the people of her time.
The author has thU3 provided himself
with a true hero and a.n Irresistible hero
ine. By no sort of means could he have
made them practicable, if he had treated
them, as history furnishes them, together.
He now goes on with their fortunes, dra
matizing Plutarch closely. till the
fourth act is reached. Here he brings out
the nobility and generosity of Antony's
There remains the proposed parting
from Cleopatra. We do not believe that
Antony will accomplish it: he will en
counter Influences to which he will not be
equal. A separate scene is given to the
interview. Cleopatra shows a! the sub
tlety of the serpent that we believe she is
and exploits her wllea from wrath to
tears. Antony, nevertheless. Is linn. So
in strength and highmlndedness, as well
as chivalrous feeling, we are begining to
have a hero. Antony has been in a meas
ure redeemed. Nomt the author begins at
once to redeem Cleopatra. The whole
souled way In which she gives up her con
trol almost wins us In Itself: ?Â£>'
"But. sir. forflv*- tae... '
Since my becomings kill m* when they do not
Eye well to you. Your honor calls you hence;
Therefore be deaf to my unpltied folly.
And all the rods go with you! Upon your

and we assume that Antony will welcome

On the contrary, he mourns her death

more strongly to Cleopatra, he is tne
more inclined to release himself from her.

SHAKESPEARE'S DOUBLE TRAGEDY.
Copyright, 1900, by Seymour Eaton.
1THIRTY SHAKESPEARE EVENINGS.
They were picked up Saturday afternoon
in the lake, where they were found lashed
to an overturned yawl. They had been
thus exposed rince Friday, when they
were capsized by a squall while sailing
from the island to the mainland. Lucien
Morden of Montague, Mich., another oc
cupant of the boat, was drowned before
he could be lashod to the overturned craft.
The two rescued men were badly frozen,
and it is thouqht they will have to suffer
nmputation of their lower limbs. They
were taken to the hospital here, where the
following story of their terrible experience
was tola by Mr. Shields:
"I'pon receiving orders to close the
lighthouse for the season we prepared to
leave the island, together with our help
ers, Mordon, Airs. Shields and Mrs. Dn
vis. We left the island on Friday for the
mainland, seven miles distant, bound for
Harbor Springs. When out only a short
time a heavy -wind struck our boat, cap-
Fizlng it and throwing us all into the lakcv
We all succeeded, after much hard work,
in reaching the boat. McCauley and my
self finally succeeded in lashing both the
women to the boat and then ourselves.
Morden had become delirious and refused
to be lashed, and soon fell off the boat and
was lost. My wife and her niece, McCau
ley and myself were tossed about and suf
fered terribly from the cold and seas
which washed over us. About seven hours
after the accident happened my wife suc
cumbed, being unable to longer endure the
'exposure to wind and seas. Mrs. Davis
soon afterward also died.
"At one time we were within a short
distance of the mainland, and would have
been washed on the beach when the wind
changed, and we were gradually drifting
out into the lake aRain. Fortunately, how
ever we were taken by the wind Into the
north passage, which is often taken by
boats corning up the lake. In this man
ner we passed Friday night, suffering ter
ribly from cold and hunger until Saturday
at 1 p. m. , when we succeeded in attract
ing the attention of the lookout of the
steamer Manhattan.
"The terrible experience and suffering
which we endured can only be Imagined
by those who have had similar expe
riences."
Both men are about 40 years of age.
MANITOWOC. Wis., Dec. 16.â The
steamer Manhattan arrived here to-day
with Wj H. Shields and William McCau
ley, lighthouse keepers on Squaw Island,
and the bodies of Mrs. Shields and her
niece, Mrs. Mary Davis.
While Trying to Reach Shore Their
Craft Is Capsized and They
Are Tossed About for

"When the Rio de Janeiro pulled out of
the harbor of Nagasaki the men discov
ered that thoy had been asFigned to the
Asiatic steerage and were herded in with
Chin<-se, Japanese. Filipinos and other
<3oÂ»iizens of the unsavory guarter. They
protested to the captain or the Rio. but
their complaints wt-re of no avail. About
ten of ihe men were assigned to the Eu
ropean steerape. but the others were com
pelled to accept the vile quarters assigned
them by the ehips officers. That mutiny
'end bloodshed did not occur was due to
the grood character of the men, who are
law-a.bidins American citizens. The storv
they told me on their arrival Is sickening
In every detail. The Chinese and Japan
ese are not noted for their observance of
sanitation and the condition of the Ameri
cans who were forced for a long ocean
voyage to herd with the Asiatics became
pitiful. Some of the men were made very
ill frcm the fumes of the pipes of the
opium smokers and the foul air of the
close quarters; and not a man escaped
severe attacks of dysentery, caused by the
polluted drinking- water, while three of
them contracted typhoid fever.
"The food given to the men was not
as pood as that given to the Asiatics, and
for the entire voyage they were compelled
to exist on bread and sugar, this diet be
ing varied by the charity of the second
class passengers, who. unknown to the
ship's officers, gave the suffering and
starving men some assistance.
The horses arsd men in charge left this
port m two tranpports and there was no
complaint as to the accommodations re
ceived by the men on the ocean voyage.
After the horses had been landed In China
p-n<l turned over to the Gtrnian troops
the men who had cared for them on the
transports were taken in a coast steamer
to Nagasaki, Japan, where they were to
embark for the return trip to this coun
try.
At Napasaki the agent of Grace & Co.
paler each man the amount of his
salary and also handed him a ticket call

"These men. all of whom are American
citizens and nearly all residents of this
Btate, were treated worse than cattle
While on the Rio de Jajiiem." said Attor
ney Reardon yesterday. "They had no
Idea when they boarded the ship at Naga

New Rule for Stamping Leases.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue
has revoked the rule heretofore observed
in the matter of stamping leases, as the
following letter "received yesterday by
Collector Lynch, from the department will
show:
Keplying to your letter of the 23d tilt., you
are advised that when leases are issued In du
plicate and each lease Is operative as an orig
inal each lease should be stamped. If, how
ever,' one of the leases is Indorsed "duplicate"
or "copy original duly stamped" and the other
lease Is indorsed "orlslnal." and is duly
stamped, but one taxation will accrue.
Before the receipt of this ruling the In
ternal Revenue Office has been bound by
the former ruling that all duplicates of
leases must be stamped.

Late last night McDonald was found
in a saloon on Fourth street... He spoke
freely.
"Miss Campbell and I were very dear
friends for yearsâ In fact, I was engaged
to the . little woman in 1S75." ho said.
"Since I met with the accident about two
years ago I had spent all of my time
nursing Cornelia. She often said to me
that she wanted to make a will and leave
me everything, but 1- would not hear of
it. But I do intend to secure that piece
of property on Harrison street, which I
paid for with my own money. Years ago,
when I was rich. I was her best friend.
1 used my Influence to get her the posi
tion of school teacher and did a great
deal more for her than ever her folks did.
Yes, she gave me $2000 a few days ago to
pay my debts with, and if you care to go
down to the bank you will see that every
thing was done in a regular way."
Yesterday Captain of Detectives Sey
mour .ordered Detective . Graham to in
vestigate the case. No steps will be taken
until the German Savings Bank opens to
day. - Dr. Charles H. Chaesley had been
the physician of the deceased for twenty
h've years and yesterday he signed a certi
ficate giving heart disease as the cause
ot death. â
$2000, "to put him out of debt." This ac
tion is viewed'very skeptically by the de
ceased's relatives and to-day one of the
first steps they will take will be to ascer
tain if Miss Campbell did really sign an
order for that amount. Among other
items of her estate, of which the Public
Administrator has charge at present, is
cash to the amount of $17,000, in the San
Francisco Savings Union.
Mrs. W. S. Jess made the following
statement last night, which was corrob
orated by George and Ii. F. Campbell,
who were present at the time:
"Miss Campbell was 59 years old, and
she, like any other woman who has
money and becomes sick, was imposed
upon. I do not believe that she gave Mc-
Donald that $2000 when she was in her
right mind, because she was of a very,
thrifty disposition. She has not been on
good terms with the rest of the family
for several years and I think McDonald
had some Influence over her and persuad
ed her not to visit Santa Cruz, where she
hag a comfortable home of her own. My
sister worked as a teacher for thirty
years and recelve/i $80 aTnonth, and of
that she spent very little. She was also
very fortunate in several investments, i
do not know if McDonald and my sister
were married, but when I met him this
afternoon in the presence of Detective
French Vice Consul Partly
Conscious but Stoic
ally Silent.
Paul Antoine, the French Vice Consul,
lies at the French Hospital in a dazed
sort of consciousness, nis splendid phy
sique and constitution battling against
the wound that would have proved fatal
ere this in the case of the average man.
He was apparently brighter and stronger
yesterday and the physicians in attend
ance say that his recovery is possible.
Bat when they consider the-nature of the
wound and how the mallet must have
plowed through the brain tissue they
shake their heads and their faces soften
with pity for the handsome man of bright
promise who is so near unto death.
Now that the police consider it demon
strated that Antoine himself fired the
shot Into his temple, they have dropped
the Investigation, and Mrs. Antoine, or
Belle Chappelle, the woman whose
charms proved Antolne's undoing and
whose mad jealousy and taunts drove him
to the attempt upon his own life, has re
turned to her kind in the tenderloin and
is no lonper under surveillance. She iÂ«
at her rooms at 3G8 Geary street, where
her sister and Cirilio Elorduy also stay.
Klorduy has a record even more familiar
to the police than that of the Chappelle
sisters. It was he Â¦who last spring got
much notoriety through impersonating
Count Artsimovich, the Russian Consul
General, and writing notes over his sig
nature on Bohemian Club paper to Miss
Josle Davis of the. Tlvoll chorus. Once
before he impersonated the son of a high
dignitary of Mexico and was wined and
dined by visitors from Mexico. Elorduy
has been an associate of the Chappelle
sisters during their tenderloin career,
both before and after the beginning of the
intrigue that in the end has sent- Antoine
in ruin and disgrace to what will prob
ably be his deathbed. At 358 Geary street
It Is asserted that Elorduy doÂ»s not live
there, but that letters or other communi
cations addressed there reach him.
Mrs. Antoine has not been allowed to
see the wounded Vice Consul Â«lnce he waa
taken to the French Hospital:
fortable home in Santa Cruz, she* pre
ferred to live for the last fifteen years in
the small rooms on Fourth street. She
had not been on friendly terms with her
relatives for several years and the broth
ers and sisters claim that McDonald is
the cause of the estrangement. They
claim that he held a seemingly hypnotic
influence over Miss Campben, which be
lief he sustained last night by saying
that he "could have got all her property
had he wanted to, and ' cared to act
mean."
The body of Miss Campbell is at present
at the parlors of Martin, the undertaker,
where it v.-as brought from the Morgue. It
will be embalmed after the autopsy and
will theti be. taken to S^nta Cruz and in
terred in the Campbell family plot.
McDonald, who was formerly employed
in a lumber mill, met with a severe acci
dent about two years ago. when he was
run down by a Southern Pacific
train. At â¢ that time he received
injuries to his liead from which
he claims he has never recovered.
Since that time he has acted as nurse to
Miss Campbell in her illness and has oc
cupied a lounge in her suite of rooms,
so that he could attend to her every wish
at night. A day or so before she died,
she gave him, so McDonald claims, an or
der on the German Savings Bank for

INDICATIONS point to a legal battle
for the possession of the property,
estimated. to be worth $30,000, left by
the late Miss Cornelia E. Campbell.
the aged schoolteacher who died sud
denly of heart failure in an obscure lodg
ing-house at 179 Fourth street last Satur
day afternoon.
On one side are the Relatives of the de
ceased woman, who are Mrs. W. S. Jess,
a resident of Santa Cruz, who was a Bis
ter of the deceased, and George and B.
F. Campbell, fruit growers of Solano. and
Ix>nzo Campbell of Santa Crue, brothers
of the late Miss Campbell. These rela.
tives arrived yesterday in the city and
will to-day apply for letters of adminis
tration. The other claimant to the estate
is B. I* McDonald, who has been a warm
personal friend of the deceased for the
last twenty-five years and who has in the
last two y^ars devoted all bis time to
nursing the sick woman. He claims that
a lot at Harrison and Tenth streets that
is now in the name of Miss Campbell was
bought with his money in 1S77 and that if
the relatives "do not treat him right" he
will establish his rights as husband of the
eccentric eld schoolteacher.
The late Miss Campbell was a most pe
culiar woman. She taught in the public
schools more than thirty years and was
at the time of her death still a pensioner
cf the endowment fund. Her father left
her $10,000 about the year 1SS5, and al

DAMAGE DONE
AT GAS WORKS
Water Tank Falls Through
the Rooi of the Engine
Room.
Presence of Mind of Assistant Super
intendent Craig Averts What
Ilig^Lt Have Been Seri
ous Disaster.
At a few minutes after 7 o'clock last
evening the residents of North Beach in
the vicinity oHiyde and Bay streets were
startled by a loud explosion which took
place in the works of the Equitable Gas
Light Company, situated on the bay front
at tbt foot of Hyde street.
Although no damage was done to the
houses In the neighborhood of the gas
work*. Investigation showed that the
plant of the new light company had suf
fered cerious injury and by tn* presence
of niicd of Assistant Superintendent Rob
ert B. Craig a big disaster was averted.
ThÂ« explosion took place in the gas com
pany s large engine-room which stands on
iÂ±e edge of the bay, and according to the
statements of Assistant Superintendent
Craig was caused by the water tank on
the roof falling through to the ground
and breaking a. number of pas pipes.
"I was In the mixing-roum gome dis
tance away," t-aid Craig, "when I heard
thÂ« explosion, which seemed to come from
the engine-room. I ran out and saw where
the trouble was. â¢ Water was pouring
down from the roof and the gas was
burning from a number of broken pipes.
I ran to the 'cut-out' and turned the
valves eo that the llames could not com
municate to the mixing retorts or gas
holders. In a few seconds the flames died
out and there was do danger from any
further explosion. I cannot say what
c&used the water tank to fall from the
rÂ»oÂ£, unless the supports were weakened
by the storm of a few days ago."
An Inspection of the wrecked engine
room 6howed that considerable damage
had been done by the forty-foot plunge
of the tank from the roof to the ground
tuid. the subsequent explosion of gas. Wa
ter to the depth of six inches covered the
f:oor: broken piece? of the galvanized roof
Â»ind bricks were piled in the machinery of
the engines; gas pipes were twisted and
bent; the windows and casings were shat
tered, and the remains of the wrecked
TTF.ter tank rested with part of the iron
TO' f right or. top of the engines.
The rrsh snd sound of the explosion
attracted attention for a distance of many
blocks, and the gripmen and conductors
cf the O'Farreil street cable lir.e were be-
Fipged with questions on their trips down
town during the hour succeeding the oc
currence.
The flrpmen on duty at the various en
gine houses la thp district where the gas
-works are situated telephoned to find out
If their services were required, but the
proffered aid was declined by the em
ployes of the Ka.Â« works.

thousand dollars to pay his debts,

Miss Campbell, Aged Schoolteacher, Leaves Estate Worth $30,000,
Desire for Possession of Which Creates a Bitter Correct Be
tween Relatives and a Male Friend of the Dead Woman
John Kunst, an architect, residing at 830
Turk street, had an experience with foot
pads shortly before 12 o'clock last night
which he is not likely to soon forget. He
was on his way home and had nearly
reached his residence wben three men
whom he had previously noticed following
him ordered him to throw up his hands,
enforcing their demand with pistols.
Kunst obeyed the command, and the
footpads then went through his pockets
and secured about $75 in cash and valu
ables. Having secured all he had on him
they ordered him to enter his house,
which he did, and they proceeded down
Turk street.
Kunst did not come out of the adventure
unscathed. He Â¦ sustained several scalp
wounds, the result of blows aimed at his
head by one of the robbers, enraged at
some resistance on their victim's part.
Kunst had recently returned from a
business trip to Grass Valley, and spent
last night at the Olympia music hall with
several friends. After the show the party
stood chatting for a short while and then
dispersed to their homes. Kunst walued
up 'lurk street, and had reached the cor
ner of Franklin when he noticed three
men slinking after him. His suspicions
wuie excited by their demeanor, and a
set ond glance over his shoulder told him
his expectations were not unfounded.. He
quickened his pace, and was within fifty
feet of his door&tep when two of the trio
came up to him. and poking their pistols
into his face demanded his money and
valuables. One robber went through his
pockets while the second one covered
him. The remaining one seemed to be
keeping a lookout. The man secured $40
in gold, $3 or $4 in silver, a silver watch
and chain and was proceeding to unscrew
a $30 diamond stud Kunst wore when the
latter, demurred. It was then that the
man beat him over the head to quell any
further resistance;
As soon as the robbers disappeared
Kunst blew a- police whistle and tele
phoned to the Hall of Justice, with the
result that several detectives were soon
on the scene.
Kunst says be can identify two of his
assailants. The man who robbed him was
a young man. short, blonde hair and mus
tache and wore a gray coat and soft dark
hat. The other was tall and had a small
dark mustache and soft hat. The third
man he could riot observe closely. After
relating his story to Â»he detectives Kunst
walked to the Receiving Hospital, where
he was treated for six lacerations of the
scalp. Â¦
Another Bold Hold-Up.
< A gang of four men answering closely
the . description of those who hold up
Kuiitz tried to rob Antonio Bengrulni, an
Italian fruit dealer, at Page and Octavia
streets shortly before 1 o'clock this morn
'ng. Enraged at getting 1 no' booty they
beat their victim over the head in the
same manner that . Kuntz was treated.
Benguinl had his wounds dressed at the
Receiving Hospital, where he informed
the surgeons that he had been held up
near his hornÂ© by four unmasked men,
three cf whom carried pistols. They se
cured nothing. The police connect ths
