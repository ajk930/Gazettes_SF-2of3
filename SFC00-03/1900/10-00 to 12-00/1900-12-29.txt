Thursday morninj? there arrived at the
boarding house a tall, handsome brunette,
who was received rapturously by s 'Mr.
Ruggles," who fairly loaded the room
with fresh flowers in her honor. They
drove around all day together and had
dinner at the house. They seemed to be
very much In love with each other. Pr*-
Johnson used to take breakfast at the
Gleeson boardir.g ho*-p. His other meals
he took at the Welland cafe. He received
numerous letters during the next few
days, explaining, to the landlady that they
were from his wife.
Kev. Mr. Johnson arrived here on the
morning of December S and took one of
peveral trunks which accompanied him to
his room at the Windsor. "Mrs. Mont
gomery" was not to be seen, but as a
bill for two was paid no one asked any
questions. He left there on Monday
morning, the 10th, and was driven to a
private boarding house kept by â¢ Miss
Gleeson at 51 Beaver Hall Hill, having
told the cabman that he wanted a nice,
quiet boarding house. He told Miss Glee
son that his name was Mr. Ruggles, and
that he wished to remain with her for a
few days. He had with him at the time a
steamer trunk and a valise and was given
a front room. He began decorating the
room with flowers, telling Miss Gleeson
that his wife was coming shortly and
would firo with him to England.

NEW YORK, Dec. 2Sâ At the home of
Archdeacon Johnson at NeWfBrightof,
Staten Island, it was said to-night that
no word had been received from James
Le Baron Johnson and that all his family
knew of him was learned through the
newspapers. Mrs. Johnson spent to-day
at her father-in-law's house, and it was
learned that her mother had gone to
Pennsylvania to visit friends. Miss Jchn
son said her brother had not been home
for at least six months and had been suf
fering from nervous prostration, which
took the form of great nervous depres

this depression of spirits, which utterly

"I called it a 'sledgehammer* promise,'*
Mrs. Boyer explains, "and I didn't pro

Wednesday night Woodcock, learning of
the marriage, visited . the home of the
Boyers on Mission street. He was in
toxicated and demanded that he be ad
mitted. His language was fierce and
wild and he sat on the_ doorstep for three
hours, leaving shortly after 1 o'clock

visited the Hall . of Justice, where she
procured a warrant for the arrest of the

for the loss of her hand.
The warrant was sent to the Seven

Ten years ago Woodcock became
acquainted with Mrs. Flora Letts, then a
widow about 30, years of age. He was
about ten years her senior. He had Just
arrived from England, where he had re
.cently.'burled his wife and left his. four
children" in 'the charge of relatives. Wood
cock rented a room in Mrs. Letts* house
at 2677 Mission street and lived there un
til three weeks ago. He was delicate In
health and Mrs. Letts cared for him and
nursed him. The friendship / Woodcock
held for his landlady ripened Into love
and for the past year he had been -her
most ardent admirer, hoping all the while
that she would become his wife. Mrs.
Letts sympathized with the man, but
Â¦would not reciprocate his love. Woodcock
secured a position as a motorman on the
Folsom-street line and held it for a num
ber of years.
A short time ago C. H. Boyer. a con
ductor on the Fillmore-street line, com
menced paying court to the widow and
at length their engagement was an
nounced. Woodcock heard of this and he
became desperate. He pleaded with the
widow to forget her new suitor and mar
ry him. His pleadings were in vain and
the marriage of Mrs. Letts and Boyer was
set for last Sunday.
On Saturday night, so Mrs. Letts claims,
Woodcock visited her. Earlier in the day
he had sent the widow a set of dishes as
a wedding present, and the object of hla
visit in the evening, he said, was to ex-*
tend congratulations. Instead of finding
Woodcock reconciled to the loss of "his
suit, Mrs* Letts discovered that he still
desired her love, and he again demanded
her promise that she would marry him.
She refused to listen to him, and then it
was that he seized her by the throat, and
after trying to strangle her, drew a
sledgehammer from under his coat and
struck her/on the head with it, until,
finding that he would murder her, \ she
gave the long-sought-for . promise and

of Mrs. Flora Letts, now Mrs.
Boyer. he emphasized his love with a
sledgehammer, so the lady 'says. â¢ Later
when his ardent and "mechanical" woo
ing availed him naught and the object of
his affections was led to the altar by a
conductor on the Fillmcre-street line, he
serenaded the newly married pair In. a
wild arid weird fashion and swore that he
would have their blood. Last night he
was found a suicide in .a -lodging-house,
with a letter in his pocket telling of un
requited love and a wasted life. While
he lay lifeless and cold, officers were
searching the city for him. that he might
answer for his rough. wooing with the
sledgehammer. Knowing this, he had
sought seclusion and cheated justice in
death. "Â»
LONDON, Dec. Z*.â There has been a
recurrence cf storrr.Â«= and violent gale? in
the channel and considerable damage has
been wrought ashore. Telegraph lines are
down in many places. The loss of life
has been appalling.
The British bark Primrose Hill, from
Liverpool December 23 for Vancouver,
drifted up the channel under bare poles.
Despite efforts to save her, the Primrose
Hill went on the Ferahos rocks three
rr.IIes off SouthFtack. not far from Holy
hrad. She broke in two and went to
pieces in a few minutes. One man out
nf the crew of thirty-five men was saved
by a lifeboat.
Some time before she struck, the Prim
rose Hill dropped her anchor?, but moun
tainous peas were running. No sooner
had thÂ»Â» ill-fated Fhip touched the rocks
than the three after masts went over
board and she broke in twain, leaving only
ih" frrpmast standing. Throe minutes
later this went also. The vessel was soon
pmashf d. The Hibemia stood by through
nut, but was powerless to aid. The Holy
lirad s=ieam lifeboat made three vain at
fempts to reach the Primrose Hill. Th<?

the energy, honesty and zeal of General
Eagan, who, he says, was nearly pros
trated from overwork. He then says:
"General allies should have known that
neither the Secretary of War nor Com
missary General could legally alter nor
add to the rations of the army. The
ration is fixed by law, and its components
can be changed only by the President of
the United States. An examination of
the records, of the War Department; or
inquiry of the Commissary Gen
eral would have speedily developed
the fact that canned fresh beef (or, as it
is known, canned roast beef) had . been
recognized as part of the army ration for
nearly a quarter of a century.
After showing that . canned beef was
made part of the army travel ration in
IS"!*, General Alger continues: "The alle
gations of. General Miles that canned
fresh beef was not a part of the army ra
tion and that it -was issued â¢ under the
pretense of an experiment were not only
contrary to fact but were made absolutely,
without a particle of evidence or excuse.
If General â¢Â¦ Miles really believed hla se

General Alger calls attention to the
fact that General ' Miles appeared before
the commission investigating the conduct
of the War Department on December 21,
1898, and that he "refused to be sworn or
affirmed, as every other of 495 witnesses
had been, declaring in substance that he
would make his statements without be
ing sworn, and % was responsible for what
he said." '.
General Alger quotes the allegations of
bad meat by General Miles, which he de
clares "grave . and scandalous." He
quotes, . also, a published interview in
which General Miles repeated his charges,
and declares "that the general's written
and official reply was "evasive and
equivocal."
"Upon Commissary General Charles P.

"the charges fell with the suddenness and
sharpness of a blow from an assassin's

NEW YORK, Dec. 23.â Russell A. Alger.
formerly Secretary of War. publishes In
the forthcoming number of the North
American Review an article ' on "The
Food oi the Army During the Spanish-
American War," which Is a very bitter
attack upon Lieutenant General Miles, a
very warm eulogy of General Charles P.
Eagan, former commissary general of the
army, and a very sharp denial that the
beef furnished to the troops during the
war was "embalmed," unfit for food or
the cause of illness.
General Alger docs not mince words in
his comments upon the commander, of the
army. He calls General Miles* charges
against the beef "scandalous." "contrary
to fact," and "made absolutely without a
particle of evidence or excuse." He says,
too. that "it does not appear that General
Miles was even honest" in making the
charges, and he discredits and sneers at
the volunteer surgeon who declared he
found chemicals in the beef served to the
soldiers.
In bis defense of General Eagan. the for
mer Secretary praises that officer as
"honest and able," and declares that his
vituperative language in his reply to Gen

tion pardonable, perhaps, in its existence,,

PARIS, Dec. 2S.â The letter from
Dreyfus to Premier Waldeck Â¦
Rousseau, demanding a new hear

citement. The Nationalists will
hold a secret conclave to decide upon
what action to take in view of the threat

which will not "down."
The Impression prevails that Dreyfus Is
now In this city. Some usually well-in
formed persons Insist that his letter to the
Premier was carefully prepared after con
sultation with various distinguished men,
one of them being especially conspicuous.
The absence of any date to the letter Is
â¢pointed to as evidence that Dreyfus is
here.
Dreyfus' letter was provoked by Henri
Rochefort's assertion in the "Intransi
geant" that Dreyfus sent to Emperor "W 11 â¢

German embassy In Paris, which docu-

crime "for which," the ex-captain write j,
"I have been twice condemned unjustly."
Everybody believes that if an inquiry is
accorded it will mean a revival of the
case. The Nationalists are | palpably
alarmed lest Dreyfus' former counsel,
now stronger than ever, may find a fo>
midable majority In both Houses of the
Legislature; that, goaded by the insults
of the opposition, will order an investiga
tion, which will result in another court
martial on the ground that new evidence
has been discovered.

Dusseldorf and accompanied the Crown
Prince in the autumn of 1S66 to St. Peters

General von Blumenthal was made chief
of the General Staff, and his imperial
Highness, when presented by the Em
peror of Germany with the Iron Cross,
declared the same distinction was equally
due to Von Blumenthal.
In 1871 General von Blumenthal was sent
to England to represent the German em
pire at the autumn maneuvers at Chat*

New Catarrh Cure.
The remarkable success and populaiitj-
of the new catarrh cure, Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets, is largely because it not only
cures catarrh, but because catarrh suf-
ferera who use these tablets know what
they are taking into their systems â no se-
cret is made of what they contain. ThÂ«=:y
are composed of hydras tin. blood root,
gualacol and red gum, are pleasant to tho
taste and, being dissolved in the mouth,
they take Immediate effect upon the mu-
cous lining of the throat, nasal passages
and the whole respiratory tract.
The cures that Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets have accomplished in old chronic
cases are little short of remarkable, and
the advantage of knowing just what you
are taking Into your system is of para-
mount Importance when it i3 remembered
that the cocaine or, morphine habit has
been frequently contracted as the result
of using' secret catarrh remedies, aa so
many of them are well known to contain
these Injurious drups.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets meet with the
approval and cordial support of physi-
cians because their antiseptic charac:*r
renders them perfectly safe fÂ«r the s*:s-
eral public to use and their compos "â¢
makes them a common sense cura f.T i '-
forms of catarrhal trouble.

proprietors, while making all Â»?rtj ef
claims as to what their, medicines wr^l tie.
are -very careful to keep It a clo?e secret
as to what they really contain.
This Is one reason why Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets have been so widely recoiari*Rd-
ed. because they are not only pleasans and
convenient to take, but the paJie-t also
knows he is not putting into his stomach
anything of an injurious character.
These tablets are sold by drussists ev-
erywhere In the United States and
Canada at 50 cents for complete treat-
ment and probably there is no better rem-
edy ever devised for the permanent cura
of catarrh, whether located In the head,
throat, bronchial tubes or In the stomach.

largest conventions cf students ever held
en the Pacific Coast opened in this city
tc-night and will continue ten days, clos
ing on January 6, 1201. The occasion of
this gathering ia the ' annual conference
of the Pacific Ccast Students' Toung
Men's Christian Association, and in hold-
Ing :t at this season of the year a decided
departure from the us-ual order of things
Is being made.
This charge was made to enable a larger
number of students to attend the conven
tion than is possible in May, when every
college is busy with examinations and oth
er work incident upon the closing of the
college year. The pood results of the
change are already apparent in the great
ly Increased size of the delegations. There
will be about lVt accredited delegates,
from nil the leadins universities and col
leges of California. Oregon. Washington.
Idaho and Nevada and a large number of
men outsice ccl'&ge iife who are interested
in the work of the Young Men's Christian
Association, as well tti several professors
from the California institutions of learn
ing will be in attendance.
The work of the convention will em
brace nearly all lines of college life and
the main purpose â that of training the
students for leadership in organized
Christian work in their respective Insti
tutionsâwill be carefully and thoroughly
carried out. The convention will be un
der the direct management of E. T. Ccl
ton. international coilege secretary of the
Young Men's Chrisuan Association, and
a number of prominent professional men
cf the Pacific Coast and elsewhere will
address the convention. Among them are
Rev Dr. E. R. DU'.e of Oakland, Rev.
Dr Frederick W. Clampett of San Fran
cisco. John R. Mott of New York (gen
eral secretary of the "World's Student
Christian Federation). Rev. Dr. H. C.

(Eer^ral secretary cf tiie San Francisco
Y M C. A->. C. V. Hlbbard of the Uni
versity of Wisconsin, George "W. Leavltt
(traveling secretary of. the student vol
unteer movement In Xorth America).
The convention is particularly fortunate
In securing the services of John R. . Mott.
and It is believed thai this, the first visit
of this eminent man to the Pacific Coast
conference, will mean much to future
work among the college men throughout
the West. '
A carefully prepared programme will be

EUREKA. Dec 2S.â The preliminary ex
amination of Barney Wilson and Harry
Sanders of the schooner Free Trade, who
were arrested yesterday upon the charge
of mutiny, was commenced before United

day. The men who constituted the fore
mast crew of the little vessel took the
management of the schooner in their own
hands on the night of December 22. and
imprisoned their skipper. Captain Anfia
son. in his cabin.
They justify their conduct on the
ground that Captain Anfinson ( was navi
gating his vessel like an insane man and
would surelv have wrecked her on the
rocks near Trinidad had they not taken
charge. Navigators claim that if the log
which was kept by Seaman Sanders,
showing the course of the vessel, is cor
rect the free Trade would have been in
the breakers in a few moments had the
sailors not taken charge. The vessel was
out nir.e days from San Francisco.
Captain Anflnson gives no sign of an
unbalanced mind. He la very indignant

knocked down in the scuffle for possession
of the wheel, and then imprisoned. Cap

With the laying' of the last rail an extra
force of men has been' put to work bal
lasting the road, and will be rushed
day and night from now on. Engineer
Hood hopes to have the first train run
ning over the new line the latter part of
January or eariy in February. Arrange
ments for the train service have not yÂ«
been completed, but It is likely that two
or three through trains will be run over
the line dally. , ,
- Thf> wrrk of closing the gap was com
menced fifteen months ago. There have
been .frequent interruptions which were
unavoidable and which prolonged the
completion of the undertaking not a little.
Chief Engineer William Hood, who has
had charge of the construction work, says
it Is one of the heaviest lines ever built
by a railroad company. Tfce building of
the gap has necessitated the construction
of seven big viaducts, all built of steel
and iron and put together with rivets.
The delays in the work were caused by
the- quitting of ganrs of workmen num
bering fifty or one hundred at a time, who
thought they saw more lucrative oppor
tcrlties in Nome or the Klondike.

SAN JOSE. Dee.. 3.â Somewhat of a
sensation was caused la Justice Ro5*n
thal's court this morning when the charge
of conducting a gambling game again at
John Zcllar was called for hearing. Jae'.s
Adams, a well known character about
town, was the complainant, as he is in
several other similar cases now pending.
He failed to appear to prosecute to-day.
Then It was that Attorney Louis Onea!
denounced Adams as an extortionist. K-j
declared the complainant was blackmail
ing the gamblers. The attorney stated
that Adams had asked one 0* his clients
for J5C0, la consideration of which he
would abandon the prosecution of th*
numerous complaints to which he hacj
sworn. This proposition b-sin? rejected,
the attorney said. Adaxns substituted a
preposition by which he was to be paid
J75 per month fcr refrainiagr to prosecute.
Justice Rosenthal said that inasmuch
as the complaint was not made with a
view to purifying the community, but 1:
appears for mercenary motives, he would
dismiss the case. He taxed the costs to

The handicap . singles on Christmas at
the California Club demonstrated the fact
that the club has four promising candi
dates for championship honors. Grant
Smith, the winner of the tournament, has
come to the front very rapidly. Drum
mond McGavin has the best style and
strokes of any of the aspirants, but he
lacks ambition to be a champion. Al Ros
enberg is a remarkably good defensive
player, but is not aggressive enough to
be a winner. A little more experience In
tournament play would change this fault.
Hodgklnson Is also deficient in a lack of
knowledge of tournament play.
On New Year's day the club will give
a doubles tournament for the Davis cup.
Being a holiday, it Is expected that this
will be the banner tournament, with at
least twelve teams in the race. O'Brien
and Jones. Collier and Crowell, Lane and
Lane, Reed and Dr. Philips, Grant and
Allen. McGavin and Code, R. Whit
ney and Btaub, and Smith and Cornel]
will be among the entries.

SPRINGFIELD. III.. Dec. 2S.â At the
State Teachers' Association now in ses
sion in this city, leading representations
of the high school section placed the seal
of their -approval upon the game of
football with proper supervision by high
school authorities and under such regula
tions as shall Insure the elimination of
brutality. After a thorough discussion on
the merits of high school athletics, the
following resolution was unanimously
adopted:
Resolved. That it Is ;he sense of this meeting
that the evils that have accompanied football
in our high schools are not Inherent In the
same Itself, but are the result of the Imperfect
understanding and execution of the proper re
quirements for its supervision and control.
Resolved, That the frame should be contin
ued; that its merits receive more careful and
Intelligent direction from school authorities
generally; that a committee of six be named
to draft a plan for the better reputation and
control of all Inter-high school athletic con
tests.
Tho committee will formulate regula
tions to be submitted to the high schools
for signing and only those schools obli
gated to conform to these rules will be
allowed to enter contests. The central
feature of the organization will be> faculty
control. .

Ed Whltby and George G. Gould shot on
the Pringle Club preserves last Sunday
and returned with ceventy canvasbacks.
A great number of nimrods will leave
the city this evening-. ; As this is the very
heart of the season and the conditions
are more favorable, now than ever before
the ponds .will be crowded with shooters.
The Field and Tule Club, the Pringle, the
Canvasback and all < the Â¦', other Suisun
clubs will be scenes of great gun popping
to-morrow.". So certain are the gunners of
long strings of birds that they are prom
ising feathered gifts for. New Year's din
ners in anticipation of great kills.
Perhaps the red-letter shoot of the year
was that of R. A. Kddy at Cordelia last
Saturday. Think of this, 1G5 birds in a
ningle day, and 150 of them canvasbacks.
This Is a record that will go down in his
tory. For three days Eddy was kept busy
distributing "cans" among his many
friends. v . â¢
Al Cummings left the city last Saturday
evening for the Field and Tule preserves
near Cordelia. He shot on Sunday, Mon
day and Wednesday, getting a bag of 140
birds, most of which were canvasbacks.
A few spoonbills and teal .were found in
the duck freight he shipped to San Fran
cisco. sÂ«^MBfcÂ«B*^M*iKN"I^S* o W* : <* ;B 8Â»5lfiy
Spoonbills and teal have been flying
over the Alvarado mar&hes, canvasback
and widgeon at Suisun, canvasback at
Petaluma, and several varieties have been
found on the Marin shores.
It was a Christmas offering, but that
day found few of - the habitual shoot
ers on the preserves." But the Saturday,
and Sunday preceding Christmas were
great days In the season's list of big
shoots. Those who were out brought back
heavy strings that showed more canvas
backs than any other species.
The great, the glorious "can" Is the bird
these days. Even on. those ponds which
the canvasback seemed, to. shun early in
the' season with a prejudiced j eye, this
duck of all duck;? has made a temporary
home. Word comes from " the I Petaluma
marshes, the ' Alameda ' : marshes, the
Marin shor s e t .from Alvarado and the San
Joaquin country ;that duclts are plenti
ful and canvasback predominate in all
the kills.
Frozen lakes In the northern part of the
State and Southern Oregon, a brisk, snap

are. sending the ducks Into the shooting

"Wash" Norvell has Just one more yarn
to tell on Virginia Carroll. Two years ago
Carroll was booking at St Louis, and his
next door neighbor chalked up 4 and 8 to 5
against a horse he thought looked a sweet
7 to B chance. This compelled Virginia to
bet the neighbor a hundred each way.
Glancing over a.t the eame slate a minute
or two later Carroll was partially para
lyzed to perceive 5 and 2 -now offered
about the horse. "Well. you can- bet your
case dollar that sucker didn't sell any
more merchandise," eald Virginia, "for at

Western wilds, the newspapers persist in
refusing to allow him rest. Such is the
penalty of greatnpps. Not so many years
ago in this very State Tod was pleased to
receive the pretty courtesies and smiles
from the modett country girls of Wood
land at a ball arranged in his honor at the
close of the fair. Then Tod rode for Book
maker George Rose. Picture, if you can
now, J. T. Eloan riding peaked looking
"skates" at ft country fair meeting. There
remains one desperate resort for Tod to
escape the petty gossip- traveling the
-rounds anent the revocation of his li

aeronautic aspirations. Perhaps if the

loon and ascend out of sight surcease

On all sides the call for good fights Is
heardâ fights between evenly matched,
clever, scientific exponents of pugilism.
Let men of reputation and known probity
come together and organize a club in
which the people who patronize* prize
fights can have some confidence, and the
game will be resurrected. There are two
clubs in the field att present, the National
Sporting Club and the Twentieth Century
Club. ; The public has been duped so much
and so often that some day It will turn
in wrath and everlastingly destroy all
possibility of the future existence, of
prize-fighting In this city unless the game
is kept clean and . untlnctured with dis
honesty. The repetition of such a fiasco
and piece of Intricate Jobbery as the
Ryan-Moffatt-Neill entanglement â¢ should
result in the revocation of a club's li
cense. The Supervisors, who grant these
licenses and permits.- have a supervisory
power, and they should exert it. There are
several members, of the board who show
an active interest In boxing, to know
whether or not the devious, crooked path
has been taken or that the fight is a pal
pable fake. If this is discovered the club
conducting such a fight should come-un
der Supervisorial cognizance.
According to. .telegraphic dispatches
Charley White and, Jim Kennedy are
bound westward to aid the promoters in
securing talent for prospective shows.
These men have long associated with
prlze-flghters.know their habits and their
methods. To make a prize-fight strictly
honest the utmost diligence and care must
be observed on theparl of promoter and
matchmaker. The public confidence Is
something that is easy to abuse, once,
twice and sometimes more than that, but
the San Francisco public has been hit so
often that no iurther juggling will save
any organization of fight promoters.
Once again the talk Is In the air 'of Dan
Stuart and his Carson carnival. . It seems
that this great fight promoter still nur
tures the idea of .a colossal fistic show In
Â¦Nevada." Stuart always was a man of few
words. When he arrives here he may or
he may not tell us of his plans.

bility, be between '.'Dutch" Thurston. Alex

One crying evil in the sport that should

Strange to say, It rests with the Super
visors of the city and county of San Fran
cisco whether or not this city will have
ring sport in 1901 worthy of the name.
Such a motley array of fights as were
presented to the public In 1900 is hardly
worthy of the name of sport. Not one
first-class affair relieved the monotony of
an unbroken, sandy stretch of mediocrity.
And the reason for this lay In the clubs
that operated and conducted the prize

/f *=^ HICAGO, Dec. 2$.â Lieutenant Gib
// son, favorite for the American
W Derby at Washington Park last
summer, because of his Kentucky-
Derby and Clark Stakes and La
tonla Derby victories, the pride of the
stable of Charles II. Smith, the Board
of Trade man, and the colt held so highly
by many turfmen that his owner was of
fered $20,000 for him. Is dead. This animal
Besides the ecven cases in Judge Mo
(tan's court, eijfht cases will be called in
Judge Cabaniss' court to-day and two
cases In Judge Fritx's court, and on Janu
ary 5 nine cases will be called la Juds*
Conlan's court, so that there are twenty
six altogether Mill pending.
Poolsellers have renewed their fight
agralnst the law. A petition was filed yes
terday by Harry Corbett for a writ of
certlorarl under which he seeks a review
by the Superior Court of the record of the.
trial In. which he was convicted .and flne<l
$25 for violating the antl-poolselllnsr or
dinance. Corbett avers that his convic
tion was. Illegal in tnat the complaint
against him did not state facts sudden*
to constitute a crime or public offense.
A similar action on behalf of Joseph Mo
han was also instituted.
"I will Issue suhpena?." said the Judge.
"to all the defendants to be In court Mon
day morning, and 'will also ask the Dis
trict Attorney to be present in person so
that some definite action may be taken.
The cases will be continued till that day."
There was also the case of Edward Mor
gan on the calendar, for whom Attorney
Porter Ashe appeared, and It was contin
ued till Monday on the same understand
ing as the other cases.
Attorney Collins Intends to appeal to the
Supreme Court in all the cases decided
against the loolsellers by the Superior
Court Wednesday, and that may account
for his objection to carrying , out thÂ»
agreement. Chief Sullivan said yesterday
after learning of the action of Collins'
representative that in hia opinion thÂ©
court has the power to enforce the stipu
lation, aa the poolsellers willingly agre-a
to It. He will await developments.
Attorney Coffey, the special prosecutor
looked surprised. He asked Levy w:--at tie
meant. "There was a stipulation made by
the poolsellers." continued Coffey. "that
if the appeal tasÂ»s went agafnst t*Â«Â»m
they would plead guilty to the cases Â«till
pending and go out of th* business."
The Judge remarked that he understood
that was the understanding.
"Well." said Levy, "the police hare
broken their side of the agreement by ar
resting some of our clients for vagrancy,
and as they have, broken their stipulation
in that regard we drÂ» not feel cal!e<l upon
to keep our side of the agreement. !
The Judge said he did not understand
the attitude of the defendants. Al! that
the court had c-ognlxance of was thÂ» fact
that a stipulation had been made f> try
the cases appealed on th"!*" merits, with
out juries and technical objections, and if
the decision of the appellate court waÂ»
against the defendants they would plead
guilty and so end the cost of prosecution
and the hardship of calling upon cltiz?ns
to act as jurors.
The decision was given aealnst them by
Judges Lawlor. Cook and Dunne, sitting
in bank. .Wednesday, and when the oa?rs
of Thomas Corbett (two char?rs\ J.
Smith. Joseph Brown. Joseph Mohan *and
H. W. Pike w?rp called In Judge Mogans
court yesterday Attorney Levy, represent
ing Attorney Collins, announced th3t thÂ©
defendants pleided not guilty and" de
manded a trial by jury.
The poolsellers do not seem Inclined to
carry out their part of th<e agreement en
tered into between them and Chief Sulli
van, that in the event of the Superior
Court deciding against them on the app?al
cases they would plead guilty to the re
maining cases In the Police Courts and go
out of bu.s'ness.

AS the finale to a somewhat

end it was just a gallop for her to step
around the ellipse in 1:40. Fred Cook's
sprinter Tayon. carrying Dominick and M
rounds, finished a creditable second five
lengths before Bathos, Headwater ran
tflsarpointinjrly, though*' carrying Fome
heavy commissions. J. J. Moran put up
his 65-pound eon on the back of Grand

The talent lined up in splendid form.
giving the books a lively tussle. Three
favorites, two second choices and a 10 to
1 shot. Dandy Jim. were the purse getters.
Probably when everybody becomes die-
SruÂ«ied with his actions Montanlc will get
in and beat some of the swell seL There
is no denying, though, that the three
year-old burned up a deal of coin by not
coming through In the free handicap, over
& mile. His price was hammered down
from â¬ to 7 to 2. and despite O'Connor's
urging he was all out a furlong from the
rtand. Mounce rode a natty race on The
Fretter. getting the Brutus horse over the
line more than a length in advance of
KJush of Gold, the mile being covered In
1:40*4. Wooster Boy made the running for
over Fix furlongs, when he had enough.
Florizar failed to show any speed.
Quite a severe jarring was given the
Ting over the win of the opening sprint by
Klorinel II. The gelding had been going:

NOTHING ABLE TO GET

There is strong opposition to fighting in
New Jersey. Chicago is out of the race,
so San Francisco and Carson City are
likely to be the amphitheaters of pugilis
tic bouts in the future.
Few flst'c entertainments will he held in
the East for some time. Already opposi
tion to hoxlng is manifesting itself in
Connecticut, and it is said fighters will
socn have to move away from the Nut
meg State. Philadelphia is no longer a
factor in pugilism. The death of Edward
Sanford, an amateur boxer, following a
bout with Joseph Kelly in the Quaker City
a week ago. has resulted in. the refusal of
the authorities to issue any more permits
for bouts.
When the Jeffrles-Ruhlln match was ar
ranged for Cincinnati it was supposed that
pugilistic event* would be encouraged in
ihe Queen City, but, the announcement
conies from the managers of the Saenger
fest Athletic Association that the heavy
weight championship battle will be the
only glove event permittea in Ohio. ' This
statement is also accompanied by the an
nouncement that immediately after Ruh
lin and Jeffries have settled their differ
ences the building In, which the event
takes place will be torn down.
Nevada is also likely to figure promi
nently in a pugilistic way. According to
a dispatch from Chicago "Dan" Stuart, a
light promoter, is now en route for Car-;;
eon City, where he expects to make ar
rangements for' holding bouts. Stuart
managed the heavy-weight championship
battle between' Corbett and Fitzslramons,
heidUn Carson jL'ity in 1197. He is a lead-
Ing spirit in the athletic club there and
owns a controlling interest in the. club
house and grounds. It is said that he will
confer with others interested with him
about the advisability of holding a pugil
istic carnival. . â¢
NEW YORK. Dec. 28.â While opposition
In the East to pugilism seems to be grow
ing:, boxing has been restored to favor In
California, and It is likely that the Golden
Gate will be the Mecca of pugilists during
the winter-months. Not discouraged by
the methods of fighters, whose actions
have made them unpopular in the East,
the Supervisors of San Francisco have
placed boxing on the list of legalized com
petitions, having issued a permit for a
limited-round bout between George By
ers anil "Tommy" Ryan, to take place on
January 11.

So small a showing on the part of the counties of
a rich and populous State like- New York tends to
console us for our own lack of progress. We have
dene almost as well as that ourselves. When we re
view the work in reilly progressive commonwealths,
however, our delay in road improvement appears
something like a disgrace to the State. For example,
the New York Tribune says: "The State of Con
necticut has built 209 miles of good roads, or had
done so a year ago, not to mention; what it mayvhave:
done in the last year. Massachusetts down to 1 - two
years ago had built more than 270 miles. And New
Jtrsey, which was the pioneer and his still the banner
The discussion that has taken place over the Oneida
proposition has brought out the; fact that despite the
three years' campaign of education in New York un
der the good roads law, only twenty-seven counties
have even made a movement for, road improvement.
In those counties, it :s said, petitions have been filed
for v the improvement of 696 miles of road, 407 miles
have 'been surveyed for improvement, but less than
54 miles have been or are being improved.
The plan, of course, has not met universal approval,
nor is it likely that ?ny other would be received in
that way. There are differences of opinion among
men, and differences of conditions among counties,
and consequently agreement is difficult. The essen
tial point is to get some plan that will have the "sup
port of the majority, and by giving it a fair trial dem
onstrate to all that it would be better to get road
improvement by. that plan than hot to get it at all.
A plan recently proposed by the Supervisors of
Oneida County, New York, has attracted much at
tention in that State and is worth noting even at this
distance. In its essential elements it is simply a pro
posal of co-operation between the : State and . the
counties. The State is to appropriate $500^000 and ths
counties arc. to appropriate an equal; amount.for.the
gcneral scheme of improving the chief highways of the
5tatc If all the counties do not vote their share of
the amount desired, then the plan, is that those doing
so shall have the aid of the State to an amount equal
tc their local expenditures, and so be enabled to go
forward with road improvement' without waiting for
the less progressive counties.
NOW that the time for the assembling of the va
rious State Legislatures is approaching there
is in all progressive communities a revived in
terest in the subject of legislation to promote the
improvement of highways. Plans of one kind or
another are being advanced in nearly every State in
the Union whose Legislature meets this winter, and
from a study of some of them California may be able
to derive information cf advantage in dealing with her
own problems of road construction.

PERSONAL MENTION.
The new South wants prosperity;: to , gain' money
even to build monuments in memory of the old South
and it finds io-cent cottonto be more profitable than
the Chicago platform and Colonel Bryan's political
hysterics.
The. Republicans will probably be able to repress
their grief at the spectacle and will go right on seek
ing commerce, expanding trade, building ships, ex
porting products of American industry, digging thÂ«;
Nicaragua canal, keeping our money sound,our, credit
good and our. position as a. creditor nation unassail
able. In fact, will go on conquesting the commercial
world and keeping Uncle Sam's feet warm and his
head cool, in;spite of Colonel Bryan aild his news
paper, and Mr. Kern and his fsore head.
Meantime, the political fatigue of the South will
seek rest by t wheeling into the Republican ranks;
where its interests and inclinations lead if The gen
eration that bore a grudge against the party that con
cluded the Civil War' has passed. A new generation
is on, that wants to live in twb-sto'ry houses and wear
white shirts, go' to church and travel, run 'cotton mills
and iron smelters and build 'ships; and ''saii'tKem. ,It

This broadside is the first answer of the besieged

They own the organization and occupy the works, and
propose that the party shall remain Populistic, even
if it lose Montana, Idaho, Nevada and Colorado, the
only States left to it in the North.

at Cleveland viciously, and put flarmony behind him.
apparently through a desire for another beating. In
1806, at a meeting v ~ in t Indianapolis, Mr. Kern an
nounced himself a gold standard Democrat and made
a notable sound money speech in praise of the finan
cial recommendations of Mr. Cleveland. Yet he was
surprised at his defeat for Governor this year, when
he stood on a silver standard and paper currency plat

Colonel Bryan improved the occasion to issue a
prospectus of his forthcoming weekly paper, in which
he will meet all comers, attack all goers, and answer
all questions, from why is a dog's nose cold to the
reason why wheat and silver so often part company
and go asunder in spite of his declaration that they
were divinely joined.
THE CALL was not mistaken when it said that
the only response to MrJ Cleveland's letter on
party rehabilitation would be a further expres
sion of hatred for him by the men who ousted and
succeeded, him in the leadership of the party.'
The' occasion came in the banquet to Colonel
Bryan at Lincoln. The Colonel and John W. Kern

DISRESPECTS TO CLEVELAND

San Francisco should do her share in showing
honor to the Red Cross. The branches of the organi
zation in other lands have been endowed by various
means, but the American Red Cross has as yet had
no endowment or sustaining fund. Let us now con
tribute to its work. Let us give the American Red
Cross the means of leading its allied societies of other
nations in all the work it may have to do m advan
cing the cause embodied in its watchword, "Hu-
It is stated that the meetings have been arranged
for in upward of fifteen thousand cities and towns in
the United States. They will therefore constitute
eomething like a gr;at national and popular demon
stration.. One of the features of the meetings will be
the "Greetings" which have been contributed for the
occasion by eminent men and women of all civilized
countries, including rulers, statesmen, poets, philos
ophers, soldiers and novelists. These men, represent
ing the light and leading of the age, have consented
to assist the Red Cross in welcoming the age that is
tc come, and their messages of greeting will be
among the best features of the celebrations.
It is- announced that the object of the meetings is
partly to raise funds ior the American National Red
Cross and partly to signalize the dawning of another
century by giving worid-wide prominence to that fra
ternity between nations which tends to ameliorate the;
horrors of war. Each of these purposes appeals to the
humane and to the generous instincts of the people,
and will doubtless draw to every one of the- meetings
audiences sufficiently large to make them enthusiastic
and impressive.
In the univcrsalism of the Red Cross there is noth
ing of sentimentality. It does not ignore the nations,
nor regard patriotism as a little thing. On the con
trary it appeals to ail noble national sentiments and
aspirations. Thus there is a branch of the organization
in every great country, and it is our own American
National Red Cross that is going to keep watch-night
i:i our cities and towns. We can therefore co-operate
with it as Americans proud of our nation and ready
to give help to every good work done in its name. .
In the course of its comparatively brief history the
Ked Cross has kept watch many weary nights among
the wounded of battle-fields and among the sufferers
of stricken cities. Its members have shrunk neither
from battle nor from pestilence. They have been in
besieged cities and among the besieging forces, with
the victors and with the conquered; and always they
havjr i5cen in every position as friends and helpers.
They have looked upon no man as a foeman. They
have been received by none with hostility. Under all
circumstances and by all sorts and conditions of men
they have been welcomed with gladness. Conse
quently at the closing of the century the flag of the
Red Cross stands as the banner of humanity, and it
will be hailed as such in the century to come.
The Red Cross is one of the noblest results of all
the moral and intellectual work of the nineteenth
century. Its humanity is universal, generous, self
sacrificing and beneficent. From every good impulse
cf the heart, from every abiding sympathy of the mind,
:t dra.\s forces which it directs to the accomplishment
of the fullest charity :n war and in peace. It makes
use of patriotism not for the purpose of arraying th?
people of one nation against those of another, but for
the higher purpose of inciting them to emulate ons
another in the great work of advancing the welfare
of humanity itself.
RED CROSS WATCH MEETINGS.
\A ANY and various will be the modes by
/ \ which the people of the United States will
celebrate the dawn of the twentieth century,
but of them all none will be more significant of great
things done and greater good to come than the watch

"I was in charge of one of the parties
sent South to observe the eclipse where
it was total. It was noticed there that
the corona, that peculiar light which the
sun throws out in slanting rays, was
more clearly defined and larger than ever
observed before.
"According to astronomical calculations
the rays of light extended much farther
than any other previous report accounts
for and "were brighter. After careful In
vestigation I came to the conclusion that
the unusual size and brilliancy of the
corona was the cause of the extraordinary
heat all over the northern hemisphere this
summer. It necessarily follows that the
more force the sun expends the sooner
it will burn itself out. The closest estl-
ON the threshold of a new century, it
is well to halt for a moment the
better to'' see your finish as others
see it. Cne of the others, accord
ing to the Chicago Times-Herald,
Is Professor T. J. J. See, an astronomer,
who has charge of the big telescope in the
naval observatory at Washington. He
claims to have made a discovery that
pleads him to believe that mankind has
only 3.000,000 years to live on mother
earth. In a recent interview on the sub
ject Professor See said:
"I believe that the existence of man
kind will end on this earth In, about 3.000,
000 years, although, of course, I cannot
state this as an undeniable fact. The de
struction of the earth will undoubtedly be
caused by the sun, but I do not accept the
theory that it will be brought about by
collision or fire.
"Cold will be the exterminator. The sun
will eventually fail in force, and light and
heat will depart from our planet. The
condition of the sun has been changing for
many thousands of years, and the end is
still a long way off.
â¢"The excessive heat this summer was.
1 believe, due to an unusual condition of
the eun. which made itself manifest in
the eclipse which was watched with such
interest by astronomers all over the
world.
"This will, according to my discoveries,
come to pass because of the exhaustion
of the sun's â¢pnerjry. Old Sol has already

2.000.000 years before the world was
plunged Into total darkness."

been set afloat frightening the timid and
credulous into a belief that the day of
judgment was very near. Most of these
scares have been based upon the theory
that the sun was moving rapidly toward
the earth and would eventually collide
with our terrestrial planet.

The approach of the new century should stimulate
the Police Commissioners to turn over a new leaf
in dealing with vice. They have done wisely. in re
jecting a bad plan; now let them act more wisely
still in devising a good one, and by enforcing it with
Â« vigor which will rid the city of thpse vicious re
sorts that are a temptation to fools and a source of
crime.
Now that this issue is out of the way the police
should set about adopting measures to effectively
close up the, forbidden places. No discrimination
should be made between one class of offenders and
another. Many forms of vice have been carried on
in this city with such boldness as to justify a belief
in the public mind that the authorities are not eager
to suppress them. That belief remains, notwithstand
ing it is well known great difficulties exist in obtain
ing evidence to convict or juries that will return ver
dicts against certain evildoers. The obstacles in the
way of the police are. understood, and the public will
not condemn the officers unjustly. Nevertheless the
opinion prevails that many of the worst places in
Chinatown or out of it could be suppressed if- the
police authorities were more resolute and determined.
With this action there passes away a threatened
sensation. The Commissioners, if they ever had any
intention of adopting the plan, were wise in aban
doning it. As was pointed out by The Call yester
day, it would have been an outrage against law to
have attempted to put it into practice* by the evasive
tactics which wero at one time suggested. Whatever
be the law, it must be obeyed by all citizens and en
forced by all officials charged w'ith. that duty.
1 ; ROM the promptness and unanimity with which
1 the Police Commissioners on Thursday. evening
l ;> r- rejected any suggestion of licensing gambling,
or of evading the la. v which forbids suc|i licensing,
it is evident there was never much danger that such
a policy would be undertaken. The sensation on the
subject appears to have been a case of exaggerated
reports, and of making much ado about ..nothing.
The policy was discussed by members of the com
mission and given consideration, but -that seems to
have been about all. At least when the issue- was pre
sented the Commissioners speedily .rejected it, and
further expressed their disapprovalof it by instructing
the Chief of Police to "enforce all the laws and ordi-'
nances of the city arid county and also of the State
relating to gambling."
A SENSATION THAT PfilLED.
THE \V;asi>ington correspondents of the London
Times and Chronicle are said to be Americans.
This being so, it is peculiar that, in their cor
respondence, they go so much beyond any bitterness
cf feeling that has been shown in England over the
Hay-Pauncefote treaty. /
The British Foreign Office has made no sign at
all, and the British press has shown feeling only be-'
cause of the talk in- our Senate % of abrogating the
Clayton-Buhver treaty without consulting England"s
wishes in the matter.
The two correspondents glaringly misrepresent the
constitutional duty of the President, and attack him
with peculiar venom aid vehemence. They mislead
their English readers by assuming that the. Hay-
Pauncefote treaty, in its original form, was passed
upon and approved in a specific sense by our people
Â«t the recent election, and that the President and the
Senate are in a conspiracy to disobey that popular
If the British Foreign Office act upon this ranting
misrepresentation it will be apt to take a position,
supposed to be in harmony with the wishes of our
people, which will of course be dreadfully antagonis
tic to the Senate and the administration. This will
create a sensational situation and lead to an acute
misunderstanding between the two Governments.
We do not for a moment suppose that the British
Foreign Office will do this^ for it understands per
fectly the constitutional limitations of the President,
and is not ignorant of the issues decided by a na
tional election \n this country.
But it is probably different with the British public,
and it is to that public that the American authors of
this sinister correspondence look for the effect which
they hope to produce. The people of Â¦_.â¢ England
brought about the Transvaal war. When the Queen
rode in the stately procession during- her .jubilee the
spectators â gentry and mob alike â saluted her with
the cry, "Ma'am, please give us a go at old Kruger."
In their present frame of mind the people of this coun
try want no war. It is true that to avoid one they will
rot sacrifice any rights nor put any in jeopardy. But
they have no ill feeling toward Great Britain, nor,
we believe, have the British people against this
country.
The action of these American correspondents can
be explained only on the theory that they are de
liberately seeking to embroil the two countries.
Our war with Spain, with all its unseen conse
quences, and sequels of which none can see the end,
was not brought about by the administration, but by
the people, appealed to and moved by methods -not
creditable to those who used them. We do not wish
to see this country and England nagged into war by
like methods. The proper policy of both countries is
peace \vith*each other and with the world.
Their Governments have upon them the duty of
conserving the prosperity and happiness of the peo
ple, and this duty cannot be discharged by war.
We resent the aspersions upon President McKin
ley all the more because of their origin with American
correspondents of foreign newspapers, who know
better than the rot they write.
The American people should* understand the
source of these attacks and treat the controversy in a
level-headed way. In the recent campaign they were
deluged with denunciations of what politicians called
an alliance with Great Britain, of which they pre
tended to see evidences. But this sort of talk pro
duced no effect because our voters refused to be stam
peded. We have faith that they will be as steady now.
( President McKinley and Secretary Hay do not in
tend that the honor of the country shall suffer, either
by sacrificing any prestige to keep peace or by violat
ing faith pledged in solemn treaties. When the peo
rle understand that the Clayton-Bulwer treaty is a
valid, vital and existing convention, they will desire
the country's honor to be vindicated by observing it.
This is not the kind of a nation that holds others to
treaties because they are weak, but breaks treaties it
self because it is strong, and no good American de
sires that it shall become such a nation.
It is perfectly plain that some politicians in the
country desire to embarrass the administration, as
they did in the months preceding the Spanish war.
But they should be admonished by the fate that befell
them as a result of their intrigues then, and not re
peat them now. * )'

information received .to-night was very
meager, but the desired permission to hold
an inquest over the body of an Indian who
had committed suicide after shooting a
fellow Indian was given by the Coroner
to Justice Blanc of Julian. The names oi"
the two Indians are unknown, both here
and at Julian. They are simply character
ized as two Indian boy?. Their home Is
with the Warner Ranch Indians and they
had gone into the San Felipe Valley to
work on the public road. The quarrel oc
curred about 10 o'clock on Wednesday, but
no one who can tell seems to know the
cause. ';*;'â¢' ". "- â¢"'
One of the boys in his anger picked up
a shotgxm which they had with them and
fixed at the other. The charge of shot
struck him in the head, filling the skin
full of large sized bird shot and leaving
the face looking like a piece of raw
chopped meat. Both eyes were put out
and it is believed that some of the shot
penetrated the skull. As soon as the boy
realized what he had done, he tried to
awaken the other to consciousness. Fail
ing in that, he probably thought hla
friend dead and left the camp. He went
onlv a little way into the road and hanged
himself to a tree with a piece of rope.
The fact of the shooting was made
known to the Constable, who began a
search and soon found the would-be mur
derer hanging to the tree .and dead. Th-!
injured Indian was picked up and cared
for. Life was not extinct, but when the
messenger left for Julian the boy was not

What did he do with this money? Many
who tell of Foster's winnings and his
failures to pay do sometimes admit that
as a spender he was as liberal to his old
time friends, broken gamblers and saloon
men as he was in furnishing ideas to rich
angels in getting staked to bankrolls.
Quiet wine parties, too, added consider
able to the pronts of the Bella Union.
After several rounds, a poker game
among gentlemen for pastime was the
Idea and the next afternoon Foster would
cash a bis check at one of the banks.
This was the rule until time changed and
Foster severed his connections with the
business.
When Nevada "petered out" Foster
transferred himself : and his resourceful
Ideas to San Francisco. The theatrical
business seemed to suit him and he be
came the proprietor of the famous old
Bella Union Theater on Kearny street. He
was in his realm there. Times were good,
moaey plentiful, and Foster made his
share of profits. As an entertainer Ned
could go Into a bunch of drunken sailors,,
then to some boys around town or to a
party of swell gentlemen who were there
on the quiet to see the *plcy shows which
made the Union the talk of the town, and
keep them interested In funny stories to
the extent that they would part with their
money willingly for round after round of
drinks and leave the place saying. -"Fos
ter is a good fellow and knows how to
make one feel at home."
For more than thirty years Ned Foster
has kept himself before the public on th s
coast. Late in the sixties he kept a
grocery store in Silver City, Nev., after
which he made Virginia City his home
and became one of the celebrities of that
town when it was in the heydey of Ita
prosperous Comstock days.
It was here that Foster gained the name
of a hustler. Of a quick, nervous disposi
tion he was ever ready to turn his hand
at anything to make a dollar. Whenever
he was short of money his busy brain
could always devise some means of get
ting some one to advance a goodly eum
to further one of his many schemes. â¢ Some
of his ventures were unsuccessful, but
failure never dampened his energy. He
was never without an idea and he num
bered many of the richest and most promi
nent men of the lode as his "angels."
LYING unconscious on a cot in a
ward cf the Oakland Receiving
Hospital, Ned Foster, known
throughout the Pacific Coast
States as a sport, gambler, show
man and an all-round hustler. Is rapidly
passing from this life.
Foster was returning to this city on Sat
urday last from Bakersfield, where he had
been for a few weeks In search of health.
When he arrived In Oakland he looked up
Norrls, the showman, who Is wintering
there, and concluded business ' arrange
ments with him for a show for the com
ing spring. During the evening Foster
complained of being sick, and engaging a
room at the Newland House retired early.
Feeling no better in the morning he de
cided to stay, and until Wednesday,
when he was found unconscious, it was
not thought his ailment was -of a serious
nature. A doctor was called in and at
once pronounced Foster in a critical con
dition. A hemorrhage of the brain, due
to a ruptured artery, was given as the
cause. Almost unknown, Foster was sent
to the Receiving Hospital, where those In
charge say there Is no hope for him.
Foster's father was an Iceman in Vir
ginia City and accumulated considerable
money. He was killed in Leadville and
Foster has given much time and money
to bring his father's slayer to justice." He
has , tried more than once to deal person
ally with the man.
Foster has always had a love for ani
mals and as a member of the local society
for the prevention of cruelty to animals
has done much in their behalf.
When the Midwinter Fair opened Pos
ter was in evidence as the owner of the
tamale franchise. Lately it has been a
series of ups and downs, mostly downs
with the man of many adventures and It
has been guessed that he has been broke.
It has been hard guessing, though, as
Foster has always been on the go and
while the quill toothpick might help to
deny the fact that he had not breakfasted
in the swellest of cafes, still before sun
down of any day Foster has been in the
running and liable to count in four figures
before bedtime.
The last good backer Foster located was
an eccentric millionaire, who spent, It is
claimed, more than 53<J,000 in fitting up a
pleasure resort in Alameda for him. No
matter how strong reports against Fos
ter's grood faith would come to him the
man of money stuck to him and liked him
for his peculiar hurry up scheming way.
Some friends whom Foster introduced
to his backer were foiled in an attempt
to cheat him out of a tidy sum. This cost
the millionaire's friendship though Fos
ter^would never admit having stood in to
skin his. benefactor.
The crowd was a record-breaker and
many who had j>aid 25 cents to see the
woman had to be satisfied with a walk in
the garden, so densely packed was the
large pavilion. Bertha made a few in
audible remarks, criea a little and prom
ised to tell some spicy stories at her trial.
That ended the performance and though
the throng felt sheepish at the thought
of having parted with the price of a
square meal to get a glimpse of the
"Queen" it was loud in its praise of Fos
ter's energetic "get there" methods.
Her arrest in this city created a scan
dal which Involved many of our well
known citizens. The papers devoted con
siderable space to the episode and much
spicy reading resulted. Bertha was held
under heavy bonds. Foster saw his chance
to turn a good trick and he grabbed It.
He took Jack Hailinan in with him,
rustled up the necessary bonds and got
Bertha out of jail. The woman of great
proportion was taken to a lodging-house
and held under a heavy guard. Foster
in the meantime had hired Woodward's
Gardens and given a heavy advertising
order to hid printer. The next day â¢ the
city was flooded 'with posters, hangers,
handbills and announcements that "Big
Bertha," the confidence queen, would tell
her life's history at the big pavilion on
the next dayâ Sunday.
Shetland ponies and with Deacon Jones
as coachman, Foster until a year or so
ago was a daily sight, and it took the
best portion of his time to make new and
renew old acquaintances with the aid of
a few rounds of drinks at Ned's expense.
One of Fester's greatest achievements in
the theatrical line -was the engagement
of Big Bertha, the confidence queen,
Bertha, a Jewish lady of questionable
age and undoubted avoirdupois, had gained
considerable notoriety throughout the
United States by her successful method
of borrowing large sums of money from
prominent men under promise of mar
riage.

on to Skaguay. Bettinger had not been
there. The case was taken up by the
mounted police. Dr. Bettinger is a man
of high standing in Dawson, where he
was, long the hospital surgeon of St.
Mary's. He is a member of several secret
orders, and has been prominent In the
social affairs of the Klondike capital.
SEATTLE, Dec. 2S.â Dr. Bettinger, a
leading druggist of Dawson and a pio
neer of the Klondike, has disappeared
mysteriously from the Yukon trail. The
belief is that he either froze to death or
was murdered/ He left Dawson Decem
ber 6 on foot, intending to walk part of
the distance to White Horse. Mrs. Bet
tinger, his wife, . followed on the stage
five days later, expecting to overtake her
husband.
on the Trail to White Horse.
Feared That He Met With Foul Play
DR. BETTOTGEB MISSING.
A. " D. Williams, brother-in-law of the
missing man, is expected out over the ice
to continue the search. - ,
SEATTLE, "Wash., Dec 28.â The disap
pearance of, Murray McDonald, brother
in-law of -A. D. William's, a prominent
mine owner on Hunker Creek, promises
another Yukon tragedy. McDonald was
last seen leaving the steamboat Tukouer
at White Horse July 1. He was on his
way back to Nova Scotia and had with
him a gold brick worth $3000 and between
$1000 and $2000 in bills. He had a habit
of "flashing" money and was proud to ex
hibit the brick, whlcn fact probably re
sulted in his death. Walter H. Adams,
who came out from Dawson earlv last
fall to search for the missing man and
is now employed at the car shops in
Skaguay, left no stone -unturned that
would lead to his discovery, but at last
has given up the search as useless.
Every hotel register in Skaguay has
been gone over, but his name is not there.
McDonald was 23 years of age and of
light complexion. As McDonald was leav
ing the Yukoner he arranged a meeting
place with Peter Nance, bartender of the
steamer, but ' was never seen afterwajrd.
Nance thought that McDonald had hur
ried cut of town to catch the steamer
Louise, which was in Skaguay at the
time, but he was not a passenger on the
Louise or the City of Topeka, which left
the next day.
The police at White Horse have been
working on the case for some time, but
have given up.
McDonald's mother in Nova Scotia is
prostrated by her son's disappearance
and believes he has been murdered.

FUTILE SEARCH
for McDonald
SACRA MEXTO. Dec 2s.â A heavy frost
visited this locality last night, and the
fruit growers say that it came as a bless
irg. The weather has been so warm that
pap was rising in the tree3. The fiost.
say the fruit growers, will send the sap
down and permit them to do the pruning
that is necessary. It is also said that
the frost will be" beneficial to the wheat
felds. The latter present a very fine ap-
I-earance for this season of the year. At
noon to-day the weather was warm and
ftonnjr. No vegetables were Injured by
the frost last night.
SAN JOSE, Dec. 28.â The clear, cold
weather prevailing here at present Is most
satisfactory to both farmers and orchard
lsts. All branches of agriculture are pro
pressing rapidly and the cold weather will
prevent the fruit trees budding early
enough to be nipped by spring frosts.
From present indications it Is probable
that the prune crop next year will be
larger than ever before in the historv of
the valley. Much uneasiness prevails
here over the present stagnation in the
prune market. Xlnety million pounds of
dried prunes are stored in the warehouses
of the Cured Fruit Association, with no
I rospect of immediate shipment, as the
I!aÂ«=tern market is dead. Usually at this
season the lanrer part of the crop has
been disposed of.
LOS AXGEL.ES. Dec. 2S.â A heavy wind
storm in the valleys north and east of
here has filled the city's atmosphere "with
dust to such an extent that it resembles
a heavy fog. The \.lnd will doubtless do
some damage to the orange crop by blow
ing fruit from the trees, but has perhaps
been instrumental in averting more seri
ous damage by the frost which was pre
dicted for this morning. The lowest tem
perature during th,i night was 46 degrees
and as the dew point was 30 degrees there
was little show for frost in even the most
exposed localities. The humidity is very
low and this dry wind will Increase the
necessity for a good rain. Grain and feed
ere looking well, but are growing slowly
on account of the t'.*:flciency of moisture.
Plowing and seeding, are slackening in
rlaces for the same reason. Orchards are
being irrigated.
FRESNO Dec. 2S.-Fresno has been en
veloped in heavy fogs for weeks at night
and during the early morning. To-day has
been the first sunshiny day for three or
four weeks. There has been frost for
several successive r.ights and last night
was the coldest this season. The damp
ness and lack cf sun has greatly retarded
the growth of pasture erasses.
STOCKTON. Dec 2?.-The coldest wave
experienced here In some time struck
Stockton last night. TJie Ahermometcr
reached 2S dÂ«"grees stove zero this morn
ing. There was a heavy frost and even
after the eun came out tho air continued
so chilly that the frost remained In tliÂ«
shade until late In the forenoon. Fruit
and grain men Bay that the frost has
come at a time when It will bo of im
mense benefit to the grain and fruit in
terests In this part of the valley, as it
will drive the sap down for trimming and
also kill off insects which would other
wise amount to a pest. Last season both
fruit and grain suffered owing to the fact
that there was no frost at this season of
the year. In the roots of early sown
grain especially there was an Insect which
destroyed, considerable of the crop. It i9
believed that the present frost will have
the effect of killing ult a large. percentage
of the grain and fruit pests and 'one. or,
two more cold nights will be of immense
benefit.

"If the Postal has made a deal of thia
kind it will be a big thing for the com
pany as well as for California and San
Francisco," he said. "It will cost the
telegraph people a good deal of money to
enter into. an arrangement of this kind.
I do not know whether or not our con
tract with the Western Union expires the
coming year. The contract was made In
1S77. In case it expires, then If this re
ported deal Is true it will mean an exclu
sive right of way for the Postal."
The Western Union at present has a
lease of all the Southern Pacific lines
with the exception of that on the South
Pacific Coast road from this city to Santa
Cruz, which is leased oy the Postal.
Notice to Mariners.

Omaha and thence direct to this city. It
is probable a contract. will b<> made wltn
tj.e Union Pacific simiiar^to the one just
closed with the SoutherrOPaclflc. As the
Postal, through condemnation proceed

the plans of "the company are speedily

J. B. Donner,' superintendent of tele

asked yesterday afternoon concerning the
reported contract between the railroad
and the Postal Company. He had not re
ceived* any official confirmation of the
report.
The Postal Telegraph Cable Company is

After an hour's wait and much skirmish
ing after a quorum yesterday afternoon,
the regents of the State University met
and awarded degrees to a number of stu
dents who will be graduated in January.
Several of the graduates wish to accept
positions as instructors, but they cannot
do so until their degrees have been award
ed, so a special meeting of the reg-ents
was called for Thursday last to pass the
degrees. There was no quorum and the
meeting adjourned to yesterday at 2

At 2:30 It looked very much like another
postponement, but Dr. Pardee was tele

honor bears the names of Regents Barnes,

of pawnshops. Of the big Frank'in-street
haul, however, no trace can be found.
From descriptions furnished the detec-
tlves by pawnbrokers the detectives wove
the web about the burglars. One pawn-
broker was told to follow the first one of
the gang to enter his store until he met
a policeman, when he wan to have him
arrested. This was done, and Policeman
Jamos McLaine made the capture of Low-
ell at Powell and Mason streets yesterday,
Ranquest and Charigino were arrested
earlier at 225 Eddy street. When searched
at the prison a cold chisel was found on
Lowell. besides a pistol and skeleton keys,
while Charigino carried a pistol.
When confronted with the jewelry
which the detectives had recovered, and
on being identified by the pawnbrokers.
Lowell and his partner broke down and
confessed their guilt of the Baker-street
robbery. Their method of operating was
old and simple, but none the less effec-
tive. Ranquest distributed bills at likely
looking houses during the day. Then the
trio would watch the house till some one
left, their next move being to ring th-?
door bell. If any one answered an excuse
was made; If not. they made an entrance,
At 2313 California street admission to
the house was gained on Christmas eve
while the family was dining out. The
basement door was opÂ«ned and then the
door leading Into the hall of the houpe
was forced with the chisel. Tests made
yesterday by Ryan and O'Dea show the
marks left by this operation to coincide
with the chisel found on Lowell,
The police say that the men are Eaat
em crooks. Their faces are unfamiliar
to any here. All three are very youthful
and of prepossessing appearance. While
nearly all of the Jewelry taken from the
Hirshberga and the Fords has been re
covered or Is located, no trace can be
found of that coming 1 from the Donau
house, yesterday the detectives discov
ered a quantity of jewelry from the Hlrsh
bergs cached in an alleyway at 630 How
ard street.
SUSPECTED BURGLARS PARADED BEFORE A LITTLE GIRL FOR
IDENTIFICATION. SHE COULD NOT PICK OUT ANT AS HAVING
BEEN SEEN BY HER AT HER HOME.
The spoils from the two latter burglar
ies were found scattered about in a score
.From the Dbnau residence the thieves
made a rich haul, the loss in jewelry be
ing estimated at $2000. The police are try
ing to connect the three men captured
with two other burglaries committed at
the residences of Mrs. Ford, 1716 Baker
street, and Mrs. Pauline Hirshberg, 2313
California street. The former house was
entered on December Â£1, the latter on
Christmas eve. From the Ford residence
$500 was taken, while the Hlrshbergs suf
fered to the extent of $600.
Jewelry, the value of which will amount
to $4000. has within the last month been
taken from three houses in the Western
Addition. One of these burglaries was ac
complished in a daring manner in day
light on December 12. In the house of
Simon Donau at 1432 Franklin street.
While the rooms were filled with guests
one of the daring robbers entered through
the basement and, having gained access
to the upper apartments, proceeded to
rifle them. While so engaged he was
surprised by little. Adele Steinman. a child
of 10, whom he threatened with death
should she give a warning cry. The little
girl told Detectives Ryan and O'Dea'. who
were detailed on the robbery case, that
she could identify the man who had
warned her to keep silent, but when con
fronted with the three suspects at the
City Prison last night the child declared
that the'man was not among them.
ONE of the most daring and clever
gangs of jewelry thieves that
has ever operated in San Fran
cisco has been checked In Its dep
redations by the arrest of three
men yesterday by Detectives Ryan and
O'Dea. The captured men are: Charles
Lowell, from Washington; Eugene
Charigino and Fred Ranquest, both
of New York City. Ranquest is at pres
ent but a suspect, he having been seen In
the company of Lowell and his compan
ion.

THE second annual meetings of the
Geological Society of America
and the Philological Association
of the Pacific Coast convened
yesterday morning, to be in ses
sion for two days, ffhe Geological So
ciety met in the morning fn the rooms of
the Academy of Sciences, while the Philo
logical Association held its meetings in
the annex of the Hopkins Institute of Art.
Both meetings were well attended and the
interchange of views on scientific and
classical subjects was considered to be
of much value by the educators and men
of learning who participated.
The Geological Society listened to a
number of most interesting papers and it
was a matter of regret that the time limit
did not allow of the completion of many
of the addresses.
William P. Blake of Tucson. Ariz., pre
sented an interesting paper on the evi
dences of the shallow seas in Palaeozoic
time In Southern Arizona, He dwelt upon
the extensive distribution of coarse con
glomerate in several of the mountain
ranges; the occurrence of basal sand
rocks and quartzltes of probable Cam
brian age and their relations to the under,
lying granite. Several instances were also
cited of new locations of Devonian fos
sils.
E. W. Claypole of Pasadena, Cal., spoke
on "The Sierra Madre near Pasadena."
The famous "Bates Hole of Wyoming"
was vividly described by Wilbur C.
Knight of Laramle, Wyo.. and was illus
trated by many beautiful lantern views.
An Illustrated address was also de
livered by H. W. Fairbanks of Berkeley,
his subject being "Notes on the Geology
of the Three Sisters, Oregon." The group
of volcanic rocks Is situated on the sum
mit of the Cascade Range In Central Ore
gon. The speaker showed^that investiga
tions proved that volcanio eruptions had
taken place since the glacial period and
In London. The version of the Alcazar
play adheres to historical facts, intro
ducing Jack Churchill, the^ dashing sol
dier who founded the' house of Marlbor
ough. Churchill will be played by Lucius
Henderson, who recently Joined the Al
cazar company, and Howard Scott is cast
for the role of Charles II. The company
will be augmented, as the play calls for
twenty epeaking roW-s. s
After the reception of the reports of the
secretary and treasurer, the chair, ap
pointed the following committees: On
time and place of meetings, Professor
Murray of Stanford, Professor Gayley of
Berkeley and Mrs. L. R. Smith of Santa
Clara: on nominations of officers, Profes
sor Merrill of Berkeley, Professor Faire
loujrh of Stanford and Professor Brodley
of Berkeley.
Professor B. M. Anderson of Stanford
University read the first paper of the day,
his subject being, "8omÂ© Notes on the
Resoectlve Functions of Prose and Verse
in Shakespeare's Plays." The address
was a scholarly one and was analytical
to a degree, being rewarded with ap
plause. Dr. H. C. Nutting of Berkeley f ol-
The morning session of the Philological
Association was devoted to,the reading of
the reports of the treasurer and secre
tary, the appointment of committees and
the reading of a few papers. In the ab
sence of Professor Benjamin Ide Wheeler,
the president, the chair was taken by
Vice President Professor E. Flugel of
Stanford University.
The afternoon session of the society was
held at the university at Berkeley, when
papers were read as follows: "A Geo
logical Section Through the John Day

At the session last evening of thÂ© Philo
logical Association an address was deliv
ered by Professor E. Flugel of StanfoixJ
University on the subject of "University
Tdeals." Profesfor B. I. Wheeler was to
have been the speaker of the evening, but
in his absence Professor Flugel consented
to take, the task. A large number cf
teachers availed themselves of the invita
tion to be present and the audience was
both large . and â¢ representative.
Interesting papers were also read as fol
lows: "Grammatical Note on Pindarâ
The Accuslve Case," by Professor E, B.
Clapp of Berkeley; "Some Unpublished
ManuFcripts of the Library of Maihlnsren
of the XV to the XVIII Centuries and
Their Relative Value," by ProfessorF. G.
G. Schmidt of the University of Oregon;
Professor E. M. Pease of Stanford Uni
versity read .a most interesting paper as
to the various translations and divergence
of opinion as to the "Note on Horace's
Satire, Iâ V, 16. 4 'Nauta Atque Viator.* "
He showed | that of all tne numerous
translations, not' two were alike, all the
translators taking a different view of the
meaning of the words "nauta" and "vi
ator." "Nauta" had been translated aa
"boatmen," "boatrr.an," "the mula driv
er." "the men In charge of the boat," etc.,
while "viator" had been translated as
"the foot passenger," "the traveler," "a
single passenger" and "all tha passen
gers."
The various papers read at the meetings
were briefly discussed by some of the ed
ucators present.
Professor O. M. Johnston of Stanford
University read a paper on "The Episode
of Yvain, the Lion and the Seroent," as
found in the works of Chrestlen ae Troies.
The afternoon session produced some
very Interesting papers, which were lis
tened to with marked attention. The most
Important of the afternoon addresses was
the one delivered by Professor J. Fryer
of Berkt-ley, who spoke on "Chinese Lit
erature." Some students, declared the
speaker, were of the opinion that the lit
erature of China was a priceless treasure,
while others opposed this Idea. To under
stand the Chinese people, one must study
their literature, the accumulation of forty
centuries. No other nation could show
Fuch a vast storehouse of knowledge, for
there was not a single branch of the
classics or general learning on which the
Chinese did not possess countless vol
umes. The introduction of printing had
greatly increased the output of literature
and to-day it had reached enormous pro
portions. While all the literature of China
was written in the classical language,
which only the cultured could understand,
the time was not far away when, in re
sponse to popular demand, the literature
of the nation would be printed In a lan
guage understood by all classes. The Chi
nese are a literary people and literature
is the foundation of their very existence.
Professor C. M. Gayley of Berkeley
closed the morning session with an ad
dress on "Fresh Light on Facts and Dates
in the Life of Robert Greene."
lowed with a paper on "The History of
the Contrary to Fact Construction in

duction.
srunny humor, their tenderness and sym
pathy and real pathos: their kindly- satire,
their dreamy contemplative spirit, their
mild melancholy, their Indian summer at
mosphere, their picturesqueness and ro
mance, to leave this and turn to the great
throng of humorists and wits that hav<Â»
filled the century with their voices, is like
leaving some old medieval castle with its
dreamy romance, its traditions of pageant
and revelry and merry Jesters, Its far
off tragedies and comediesâ so far off,
indeed, that the present seems half for
gotten â and stepping; suddenly into the
blaze of the circus, with Its pointed
clowns and its brass band. Yet among
the American humorists there Is a little
group that may be classed with Irving.
Pauldtng, who was a neditor of "Salma
gundi" and who wrote much In the vein,
of "Knickerbocker's History"; Donald G.
Mitchell, fui, of sentiment, often really
pathetic; George William Curtis, ths
kindly satirist of the *'Potiphar Papers."
and Charles Dudley Warner, the biogra
pher of Irving, are the leading 1 figures In
the little group.
Of these Warner deserves the first place
as a humorist. His graceful sketches,
with their refined touches and their per
fect art stand at the head of one small
branch of our humor. Warner and Mark
Twain were long neighbors In Hartford,
yet In their writinga they stand a whols
world 'apart. No two authors could he
more perfect antitheses, Warner wu cul
tured and self-restrained: he was seldom
witty and never coarse: he was leisurely
and finished In his stvle and his humor
is like a delicate aroma that pervades h;Â«
whole work. One never bursts In a roar
as he reads "My Summer la a Garden"
or "Backlog Studies,"' but onÂ© feels on
every page that inward emile, that warm
glow about the heart, that kindly feelln<
toward all created things, that the trua
humorist alone can give. It Is Impossi
ble to do justice to a real humorist with
a quotation.
We have a cat. & magnificent aahnal et thÂ«
sex which votes (but not a polecat)â Â«o larr*
and powerful that If hÂ« were In the army hÂ«
would be called Long Tom. He Is a cat of fine>
disposition, the most Irreproachable morals I
ever saw thrown awav in a cat and* a splen
did hunter. He spends his nights, not in social
dissipation, but In gathering in rats. mice, fly
ing squirrels and also birds. When he first
brought me a bird I told him it waa wron*.
and tried to convince him while he wu eating
it that he was doing wrong, for he is a reason
able cat and understands pretty much every
thing except the binomial theorem and the timo
down the eydoldal arc But to no effect. The
killing of birds went on ta my great regret
and shame.
The other day I went to my rartfen to get a
mess of peas. I had seen the Gay before that
they were Just ready to pick. How I had lined
the ground, planted, hoed, bushed them! â¢ â¢ â¢
What a touching thought It was they had all
pedded for me! When I went to pick them
I found the pods all split open and the peas
gene. The dear little birds, who are so fond
of tha strawberries, had eaten them alt.
â¢ â¢ â¢ I went Into the bouse, I called. Calvin
(that Is the name of our cat). I petted Calvin.
1 lavished upon him an enthusiastic fondness!
I told him that he had no fault; that the onÂ«
action that I had called a vice waa a heroto ex.
hlbltion of reeard for my Interests. I bads him
fro and do likewise continually. I now saw
how much better Instinct Is than mere un-,
guided reason. Calvin knew. If hÂ» had put
his opinion Into English (instead of his native
catalogue) It would have been "Yoa need not
teach yotzr grandmother to suck efg*."
Warner was a kind of lattar day Ir
ving â¢ without his early exuberance and
without his mild melancholy. He delight
ed in the dreamy romance of the Orient:
he had a delicate vein of pa-thos and a
warm human heart that went out to every
man as his brother; he had a sly rein of
satire that was whollv without mailca
and withal he possessed a true sense of
the ridiculous that, fused with his other
qualities, produced humor of the mos>r
genuine kind.. In the words of Underwood,
"'his books bear rereading, Â¦which is the
proof of their duality. In the case of
many books of comic intention a sinr:?
glance takes In the proffered jokes; tha
wit Is exhaled and the pages are hence
forth as stale as exploited conundrums.
The works â¢ of the true humorist rentvt
! their freshness and. like our author's gar.
den, though often traversed, are dewy
and fragrant with each new day."

With all Its exaggerations and bur
lesques and broad fun there is at the basl3

There are in thÂ© "History" abundant
germs of what In later days deteriorated
into mere buffoonery and horse-play. The
story of the old Dutchman who resisted
the edict of Peter the Headstrong which
forbid the wearing of queuee, and who.
dying at the moment of victory, ordered
with his last breath that a hole be mado
in his coffin so that the queue might hang
out at the funeral as a symbol of his vic
tory, might have been written by Mark
Twain. Whole chapters are full of de
licious fun, never strained, never weak.
6s spontaneous as the laughter of a
healthy child. It Is first of all a broad
burlesque, a mock heroic prose epic that
laughs with Innocent glee at everything
which It touches. Its characterizations
and situations are ludicrous in the ex
treme. How could one improve thÂ© pic
ture of Wouter the Doubter?
Ha was a very wise Dutchman, for be never
said a foolish thingâ and of such invincible
gravity that he was never known to laush. or
even to smile through the course of a long and
prosperous life. Certain, however. It Is there
never was a matter proposed, however simple,
and on which your common, narrow-minded
mortals would rashly determine at the first
glaÂ£,?e, but what the renowned Wouter pat on
a eighty, mysterious, vacant kind of look,
shook bis capacious head, and, having smoked
for flve minutes with *e<3oubled earnestness,
sagely observed that "he had his doubts about
the matter." â¢ â¢ â¢ His face, that infalllDle
index of the mind, presented a vast expanse,
perfectly unfurrowed - or deformed by any of
those lines and angles which disfigure the hu
man countenance with what is tanned expres
sion. Two small gray eyes twinkled feebly
In the midst like two stars of lesser magnlture
in the hazy firmament, and his full-fed creeks.
which seemed to have taken toll of everything
that went Into .his mouth, were curiously
mottled and streaked with dusky red. like a
Spitzenberg apple. His habits were as regular
as his person. He dally took his four stated
meals, appropriating exactly an hour to each;
he smoked and doubted eight hours, and be
slept the remaining twelve of the four and
twenty. â¢ â¢. â¢ In bis council he presided with
great state and solemnity. â¢â¢â¢-â¢< When any
deliberation ; of extraordinary length and in
tricacy was on the carpet the renowned Wouter
would absolutely shut his eyes for full two
hours at a time, that he might not be disturbed
by external objectsâ and at sneh times tbe In
ternal commotion of his mind was evinced by
certain regular guttural sounds, which his ad
mirer* declared were merely the noise of con
flict made by hit contending doubts and opin
ions. . , - - 1 '
They then called a council of safety to smoka
over the state of the province. After six
months more of mature deliberation, during
which nearly 600 words were spoken and al
most as much tobacco was smoked as would
have served a certain modern general through
a whole winter's campaign of hard drinking, it
was determined to fit out an armament of
canoes.
The earth shook as if struck with a paraly
tic strokeâ trees shrunk aghast and withered
at the sightâ rocks burrowed in the ground like
rabbits, anil even Christian Creek turned from
Its course and ran up a mountain in breath-
The lady of "Wouter Van Twiller onco had
occasion to empty her light pocket In search
of a wooden ladle, and the utensil was discov
ered lying among Â»ome rubbish In one corner.
A deplorable accident happened last assem
bly in cocseguence cf the architecture of a
lady's figure not being sufficiently ctron;. In
the middle of oce of the cotillons the compary
was suddenly olanued by a tremendous crash
at the lower end of the room, and on crowd
ing to the place discovered that it waa a fine
figure which had unfortunately broken down
from too great exertion in a pigeon-wing. By
great good luck I secured the corsÂ«t, which I
carried home In triumph; and the next morn
ins had It publicly dissected, and a lecture
read or. it in Surgeons' Hali. â¢â¢â¢ By ac
curate calculation I find, it dangerous for a
fine figure, when full dressed, to pronounce a
word of more than three syllables. Fine Fig
ure, If In love, may Indulge in a g-entle sigh,
but a sob is hazardous. Fine Figure may smile
with safety, may even venture as far as a
giggle, but must never risk a loud laugh. Fig
ure must never play the part of a confidante,
as at a tea party some fine evenings since a
young; lady, whose unparalleled Impalpability
of. waist was the envy of the drawing room,
bunt with an Important secret, and had three
ribsâ of her corsetâ fractured on the spot.
There was nothing especially original in
the humor of the "Salmagundi" group.
Their work was but a survival of the
eighteenth century \ periodical of Steele
and AddlEon, but In It there were germs
of a really original humor. In "Knicker
bocker's History" Irving broke away
in a large degree from, his Knglish model.
The style of the work is, on the whole,
finished and correct, full of a dignified
and leisurely self-respect, very much in
contrast with that of many later humor
ists, but its humor is none the lees truly
original. . Nearly all of the devices made
use of by later American literary come

The little periodical, with Its unknown
board of editors and its fearless criticism
of manners and people, became during
its short existence almost a sensation in
New York. Its exuberant spirits, its
"more than Cerberus watch over the
guardian rules of female delicacy and
decorum," its intimate knowledge of "the
conduct of the fashionable world" and its
severe ridicule of "the gentlemen who
doze away their time in tne circles of the
baut-ton," made It delightful reading for
many.
Female costume was a constant subject
for satire and fun.

"When Washington Irving in 1S0O pub
lished hl3 "Knickerbocker's History of
New York" he certainly did rot dream
that he had made the Initial book of a
new and great literature, nor that he haa
given to bis countrymen a humorous work
that they were not to see surpassed for
at least a century. Nothing had bsen
further from the author's intent. He had
begun the book as a huge practical joke;
it was to be a burlesque on a certain
pompous handbook of New York. He was
scarcely out of his boyhood. The world
was a merry comedy; he was bubbling
over with life and animal spirits and the
joy of existence, and he wrote for the
mere delight of it. The result was a spon
taneous overflow of fun and satire, of wit
and humor and gay burlesque. Nowhere
else in English is. there such an. elaborate
piece of unstudied, spontaneous, perfectly
natural humor. There is not the slightest
straining for comic effect as in so many
of the later humorists; there are no Jokes
dragged in by the ears; no painful efforts
to keep up the fun at any cost. The au
thor is funny because it Is perfeptly nat
ural for him to be soâ indeed, because it
Is impossible to be anything else.
The young manhood of Irving was gay
and vivacious. With a little band of boon
companions,. "The Nine Worthies,"
among whom were the novelist Paulding
and liis own brother, William Irving, ho
Imitated the jovial Steele and Fielding
and Goldsmith of an earlier day. Con
stant contact with the best social circles
kept the little band from dange'roua dis
sipation, but its merry meetings at pub
lic inns and private homes were full of
liveliness and wit. In 1807 the club planned
to issue a periodical to voice its gayety
and wisdom, even as Steele and his fol
lowers had been moved in an earlier era.
The result was "Salmagundi; or. the
Whim-Whams and Opinions of Launcelot
Longstaff, Esq., and Others," a Little, ir
reguiar periodical whose object; as stated
by its editors, was "simply to instruct
the young, reform the old, correct the
town and castigate the age." Xever did
youthful spirits and unbridled fun flow
more gayly and freely. The young re
formers were perfectly fearless and irre
sponsible:
Ining ig the greatest of American hu
morists. His tenderness, his de^p pathos,
his quick wit. his spontaneous humor,
unite in a combination rarely found any
where. Bryant, his contemporary and
intimate friend, declared of the "History
of New York" that "when. I compare It
with other works of wit and humor of
similar length I find that, unlike most of
them, it carries forward the reader to
the conclusion -without weariness or
satiety, so unsought, spontaneous, self
suggested are the wit and humor, â¢ â¢ *
His humor not only tinged his WTlting^
but overflowed in his delightful conversa
tion." Warner declared it to be> "the rich
est piece of native humor that the coun
try has produced" and Bverett once said,
"I know of nothing happier than thi.i
work in our language."

their graceful, leisurely movement; their

In part as follows:
Of all the lands in the world Japan is the
moÂ«t fascinating. Others hive equal be&uty
of sce-nery, greater grrandeur. more noble works
at art, more interesting problems of society.
But none exert an equal fascination. No one
who has ever been in the real Japan, which
lies outside the treaty ports and the foreign
betels and railway*, ever could or ever would
forjret his experiences. No one If he could
Â»ould ever fail to return.
The great wcret of this charm l!eÂ» wjth the
people their.sWves. They have made a fine art
of personal relations. Their acts are those of
trood taste and irood humor. Two cities of
aÂ»>out the same size and relative importance
are Paris and Tokio. So two could chow a
proaTrr contrast in fplrlt. Both are in a 6ense
cities of pleasure. Tokio is a city of continu
ous Joyousness. little pleasures drawn from

the future fcr the Joy of the present.
No one who catches the spirit of Paris can
miss the underlying Eadness. the pity of
it ail. The spirit of Tokio â not of ail Tokio,
but cf its life as a wholeâ Is as fresh as the
fin* of birds and it is good to be under Its
fpell.
Part of this spell Is the fair scenery of Japan.
Orrat woÂ«-v<jed mountairs. snowy cones of vol
canoes, dashing river? and resting lakes, each
dropped in its place with a wonderful eye to
the picturesque. The tall cryptonwrias of the
crntral forests rival their sister sequoias and
redwoods of the California slopes. The Japan
ese pine is unique among trees, for wherever
Jt irrows it stands as if posing for its portrait,
the center of each scene in which It occurs.
If there be an island of white a*hes in eonie
purple bay, there will Ftand seven pines in
a rÂ»w across it. each pointing its long arms
in Â»iÂ»n different directions. On the old royal
hijehway of the feudal days, from end to end
of Japan, stand long rows of sheltering pines
as old as the dynasty, and each one with all
the individuality of one in a series of king*.
The great pine of Karas&ki stretches its. long
Â«rntt further than thow of any other tree
whatsoever in any country-
The pr-ography and the history of Japan have
thfir charms a* well, and thene sink deep in the
hf-arts at the Japanese. Kvery moor was once
the scene of a great battle. On every moun
tain ;Â¦;..-* great deeds were .wrought. Even
though these name* and deeds have long since
been shrouded in mythology, yet they are none
the less potent to touch the heart of the new
as of the old Japan. From the great central
mountain aiis of the main Island rocky pro
mnntoriPt thrust themselves out across the
rice fields far into the sea. The warm Kuro
Fhiwo. or Black Stream, comes up from the
Philippines and Formosa and washes the crars
in which these promontories end. In the warm
water and the sultry, vajior- laden air is devel
oped the richer marine life that dwells on ary
coast in the wh-jle world. And this abundance
of life on land and f>ea by day or by night is
one of the J"ys of Japan.
With the people themselves the virtue* of life'
ore an clowly Joined together. The name of
Hushido means the vplrit of honor, and thlÂ»
honor covers all the virtues of Bobrtety, hon
esty, hopefulness;!, patriotism and religion. It
is the Japanese character at its best. It makes
this character and in turn it is created by It.
The Fhlnto religion, the primitive religion of
Japer. is often defined af "'Ancestor Worship."
It is more than this, far more, but It is also
leÂ«Â« than this. It has been called no religion
et all and I found it so called in the encyclo-
I*dia. because it has no creed, no ceremonies
necessary to Its practice, no sacred legends or
mysteries and nothing of the machinery of spir
itual power which characterize great religions
In other countries. It makes tio proselytes. It
nppope* no belief and insists on none.
It Is the animating spirit that causes a
Japanese to love his children. tÂ» be kind to his
wife, to help the stranger, to be. loyal to Japan.
to devote hts life to her service, and above all
to be worthy of the traditions of his ancestry,
to n* a man even as hi? creat fathers were, and
to do no act which is unworthy of hiÂ« clasa, of
tOm education, or of his training.

Jap&nese students belong largely to the Samu

In ail their studies and In all their work. It is

Â«r,Â« <â¢ Â«> nf th* least useful of men and roon
Â«nngÂ» to the level of the similarly outcast
Anglo-Saxon.
These rÂ«ctÂ« will help us to understand cer
tain critic-Inn* on Japan. The merchant com
plains that th* Japanese have no business head
and are careless of their contract*. In this con
nection we may note the paradox In the rela
tions of the Japanese and Chinese to business
methods and public honeety. The Chinese are
tne business men of the Orient. The China
man s word is his bond and his contracts are
carried out to the letter. In Japan, the mer
chant who has miscalculated asks his credi
tors to pay his debts. He shows to others equal
courtesy. His sense of good taste Is stronger
than his sr-nse of equity. Yet while from the
lowest to the highest the public life of China Is
corrupt, there are few countries on earth so
honestly governed as Japan. The spirit of
honor animates the Japanese official and a
public office is a public trust.
The missionary Rays that Japan Is given "over
to materialism, and that Herbert Fpencer holds
greater sway over even the converts than the
church. The man of science notes the prefer
ence of the Japanese scholar for memorization
of words or for half understood abstrusities of
philosophy. There is said to be no philosophy
] in Japan, and into this vacuum comes Herbert
Spencer. The man of the world finds the Jap
anese immoral, not remembering- that vice is
j e*rywhere near to him who seeks It.
But all these criticisms are skin <leep. I'n
j der all is the ifreat loyal, grenerous. nation, the
embodiment of good hope, good taste and good
willâ a people who love their homes, their chil
dren and their country on whose soil no for
eign Invader has ever yet set his foot.
In Tokio I addressed the teachers of the city
on "'What Japan Has to Learn From the Edu
cational Experience of America." I tried to
tell them that she has to learn the value of in
dividual Initiative and individual adequacy;
that equity Is higher than courtesy; that the
cure for vice is found not in prohibition, but
In the strenEthenin;? of the moral backbone of
the Individual man; that women must be
trained If home? are to be centers of culture
I and purity, and that the final end of education
Is not promotion, nor culture, nor the acquisi
tion of knowledge, but the development of per
eonal effectiveness. The man should know the
world and his place in it that he may do his
part to the best advantage of himself and
other*.
In Japan there Is a general, almost romantic,
feeling for America. It was America, who. In
If*, first opened Japan to the activities of the
Wett. It was America who led in the estab
lishment of the Japanese school system and
j the great Imperial University at Tokio. To
Japan. America Is her nearest and best friend
among the nations, her guide and leader in the
] paths which are new and strange.
j As America must fare both ways and aa this
part of America muFt face the Orient. It is
well for us to remember the kindly feeling of
the Japanese people and to meet it half way.
President Thwinp delivered the last ad
dress which he will ffive before the as
sociation on "Tools Â«ind the Man." He
said In part:
The tools that lie behind the man. that make
the man. are thought, appreciation, righteous
ness. The man wlio can think, who can put
this thought ovrr against that one and can
i r*ach a conrluslon is a power. Ability to think
Â¦ is of much more consequence than what we
j call scholarship. If in the one thousand or
j more students In Stanford University a. single
j scholar can be found. Its distinguished presi
dent may consider himself fortunate; but that
I university or any other Fhould make every one
of Us students a thinker.
I sometimes play golf with a man named
John D. Rockefeller. Occasionally he admon
â¢ lshes me, "Mr. Thwing, play with delibera-
I tlon." He has told me, '"I go over and over
my figures time and time again to make ab
solutely sure that I am right."
I have been asked here, "Do you approve of

fuaRes on"The Failure of the Accrediting
ystem," he asserted that by the pres
i ent system of accrediting high schools by
! the University of California the unlver
i sity was griven undue power over the high
; schools. As a result, he said, the high
1 school curriculum is arranged with a view
mainly to fitting the tfupils for the uni
: versity. though but 7 to 8 per cent of
t them "ever enter college. Or. Goebel con
' tinued:
[ The accrediting system is frail also because
1 the university examiner spends only an hour
I with a clasp and then reports whether or not
j the school should be accredited in that branch.
The Investigation is necessarily superficial and
Â¦ grave injustices are sometimes Inflicted. It la
i rrjorted that there have been cases where unl
Â¦ versity examiners have allowed personal dls
j like of certain teachers to uway them to the
i extent of refusing to accredit the classes of
such teachers. High school teachers feel that
they have to take orders from university pro
fess"'*.
This criticism applies not alone to California,
' but also to many other States.
Profppsor Goebel suggested as remedies
i the appointment of a regular examiner,
i who would give all hl& time to the work:
the examination of graduating classes
alone, and the admission to the univer
sity on probation of students of non-ac
credited schools.

before business began was that there would be

prices. May opened tt@Uc lower at 72*4o to

dropped to 72%Â®72*4c. The unloading of wheat
that had been expected had failed to material

A rapid price movement in an Individual stock

never failed to attract a. horde of speculative
following, with buying order* coming from

THE STOCK MARKET.
NEW TORK, Deo. 28.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say: A fitting close to a year of ex
ceptional and in some respects unprecedented
activity Is furnished by the very general re
port of large holiday business in the past week.
The best report as to this sort of trade comes
from the Southwestern section, .but except In
some parts of the spring wheat and lumber
belt of the Northwest satisfactory advices are
quite general. Heavy-weight clothing, too, has
been measurably helped for the same reason,
but despite a good business in the past two
weeks, the fur trade has apparently lagged
somewhat owing to mild weather. In whole
sale trade business has been of seasonably
small proportions, but reports from leading
lines, such as Iron and steel, shoes and leath
er, lumber, glass and spring dry goods, have
been encouraging, chiefly, of course, as re
gards the views entertained as to the outlook
rather than as to new business actually accom
plished. Stock taking Is now In progress, and
details as to accepted results probably may
be forthcoming soon after the close of the
year. /
Speculation In cereals has been light, and
Increases In supplies and large surplus reports
from the Argentine republic have still further
depressed the long interest In wheat.
The world's wheat supplies are about on a
par with those of a year ago, and American
supplies are actually umaller. Prices as, a
rule are eteady and change* few. The con
spicuous advances are in refined petroleum on
export trade, and some gain Is noted in tin on
the week, although the close is below the
highest. . Coffee is fractionally higher. Lard
Is weaker but by far the largest list ot staples
Is unchanged. Wool has been quiet but steady.
Wheat, including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 4,011.105 bushels, against 4,123,
350 last week and 3,610,557 bushels in 1599. From
July 1 to date this season -wheat exports are
94,151,455 bushels, against 103,994,193 last Eea
eon, and 121.628.709 In 1898-99.
Business failures In the United States for
the week number only 213. against 2S7 last
week. 220 in this weak a year ago, 218 In 1S0S
and Â»7 in 1897. Â£
Canadian failures for the week number 15.
against 28 last week, 22 in.thla week a year
ago, 10 in 1898, and 22 in 1897.

CALL BOARD SALES,
Chicago opened easier, Â¦with a moderate de
mand and some selling by {raders. -Later on
a firmer tendency developed, the shorts cov
ered and -local support was given the market.
The Government estimate of a crop of 622.000,000
bushels wae considered rather bearish, though
the previous crop was D47,000,000 bushels. The
report, however, caused no selling.
A cable from* the Argentine said that the
Wheat indications were poor in portions of
Santa Fe province. Thie week's shipments
from the Argentine were 424,000 bushels, against
552,000 for the same week last year.

Further Illustration has been given this week
regarding the . force . of the bullish Influence*
which at present 1 govern the movement of
values in Wall street. Another good* bank
statement tended to negative fears that there
might be a check to the progress of the market
on account of high - rate* for money, a caube
which has checked so many promising move
ments in recent years. . In fact, though the
preparations for the largest January Interest
and dividend disbursements in the . history of
the country have been In full progress, the ar
rangements have been . so skillfully conducted
that, despite the sustained activity of the deal
ing in â¢ securities, the expansion of speculation
and the notable rise In prices, supplies of calf
money have not failed - and Interest 1 rates, have
not advanced* to figures which would give oc
casion for timidity or, induce liquidation. ' The
street, in fact, not unnaturally,. concludes that
interests which are concerned in the develop
ment* regarding various properties In the stock
market are also using their Influence to â¢ keep
money in such a condition that.no pressure. or
disturbance : can arise from . that â¢ source. : If

NEW YORK. Dec 28. â On the opening the
market was quiet, with prices 1 to 4 points
lower, under light room and some foreign sell
ing. Soon after the call near months' shorts
took fright on rumors that January was to be
fÂ«.rced considerably higher. Prices readily
responded to the Change in feeling, and as
Liverpool quickly' rallied to conform with our
firmness a substantial net rise was soon re
corded. January climbed to 962 and Decem
ber was also much firmer. The close was
quiet, with prices 4 points lower to 8 points
higher. â¢

NETW YORK, Dec. Â£8. â Business Â¦was gen

of Important new developments. Tin waa about

liberal arrivals. The close here, however, was
steady, on the basis of $26 90Â®27 20, owing to
a lack of sailers. Copper In London was fairly
active, 2* 6d lower, at Â£72 15s. The local *lt
uatlon, however, remains In a somewhat nom
inal condition. Prices were quoted at $17 for
Lake Superior and $1C 62% for casting, with
more sellers than buyers. Lead was dull, but
steady, on the basis of $4 37%, while prices

Provisions.
The depression In Prunes, about which so
much is being said, 1* due, according to local
dealers, to the great abundance of all fruits
this year, not only in the United States, but
elsewhere. For instance, there Is a very heavy
Apple crop. Then there is an abundant supply
of Oranges, and Bananas are extremely plenti
ful. The abundance of these fruit* cuts down
the demand for Prunes, but dealers think that
the Inquiry will improve soon after the turn of
the year.

It Is not a bad sign that the local Jobbing
trade in footwear is quiet, nor that orders re
ceived by manufacturers from salesmen are
small, as most travelers returned home for the
holidays. Hence, -new contracts are not large,
but factories are running at full capacity and
in many cases refuse to duplicate orders at pre
vious prices. Wool lost the temporary increase
in activity, sales agrsrejjating only 4.57G.700
pounds, a decrease of 2,661,300 compared with
the preceding week.
Stocks at the close of the year are excessive,
although dealers are encouraged by the knowl
edge that manufacturers' supplies are light.
More talk of a general reduction In coke and
cheaper ore after navigation opens might be
calculated to unsettle quotations of the finished
products, but iron and steel continue the even
tenor of their way. In every department of
this industry more business is offered than can
be accepted, unless purchasers are willing to
give much time for delivery. One lang-e rorelgn
contract was lost on this account, and at many
points domestic operations are delayed by in
ability to secure material. Instead of the agi
tation for cheaper steel raiU that was so
prevalent a short time ago, producers are
said to contemplate an advance. Domestic
contracts In this line exceeded 50,000 tons at
Chicago, and amonx foreign orders Is noticed
one for 17,000 tons from Australia, with many
smaller sales. Structural material is wanted
for buildings and bridges, with noticeable ac
tivity in this department for export.
Such general preparation had been made by
Eastern Interests for a squeeze In money near
the end of the year that the expected advance
did not occur and collections in the .interior
were bo good that banks made general com
plaint of the scarcity of mercantile paper of
fered for discount. This outcome was par
ticularly encouraging, though business will
need more money after January 1. Meanwhile
a Rood undertone has been continually in evi
dence, founded _upon the active distribution of
merchandise South and West, sellers assuming
an Indifferent attitude, except in cotton goods
and some branches of silk, where the general
improvement has been reflected to a compara
tively small decree. In both cotton and silk
circles better things are expected In January,
and in no direction has a reduction of work
ing forces in mills occurred. Some wage dif
ferences have been adjusted. In this respect
the situation is unusually bright.
NEW YORK. Dec. SS.~- R. O. Dun * Co.'*
Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
"White It U not yet possible to print accurate
figures of failures during the full year U 1900.
a preliminary statement may be made that will
approximate the final result. Detailed returns
for all but the last few days of the year have
been compiled, and adding a proportionate
amount for the time still to elapse, It appears
that commercial failures will number about
10,630, with liabilities of J137.0O0.O0O. Of this
number 230O were in manufacturing for 149,
760,000, 7800 In trading for $60,000,000 and 630
brokers, transporters, etc., not properly be
longing to either of the other classes, for J27,
250,000. Besides these strictly commercial de
faults there were sixty financial concerns with
liabilities of $34,000,000, swelling . the total to
10.690 in. number and J17O.O0O.00O In amount.
This shows a large Increase over the preceding
year, when. all failures numbered 9393 and lia
bilities wore $123,132,678. It must not be for
gotten, however, that 1S93 was a year of ex
ceptional prosperity, and while trade was then
stimulated by rising prices, the succeeding
year had to bear the brunt of reaction. Despite
these disasters, made unavoidable by the very
conditions that broupht such a phenomenal
record for lSiÂ»9. it still will be found that 1900
compares favorably with other recent years.
The week In many, respects has been one cf
the most remarkable ones Â¦ since the "boom"
which started Immediately' after the election]
began its course. Last Saturday, although the
Stock Exchange was to be closed on Monday,
as well as on Tuesday, Christmas day, prices
advanced throughout Â¦ the list and the volume
of transaction surpassed all. records for a half
holiday, Â¦ sales of 1,000.000 shares being officially
recorded, and the real total was of course con
siderably larger. On Monday, however, the
London market was open, and great activity
and strength developed in Americans there.
The buying of our stocks was supposed to ema
nate largely from New York, but It was sup
plemented by covering: by the foreign bears and
purchases by the European public. Even on
Christmas day there was a further exchange
of bullish opinions In all the uptown resorts
of brokers and their customers, and some trans
actions were reported to have been made at
advanced quotations in Sugar, St. Paul and
other favorite stocks. In spite of the fact that
support and manipulation by Inside Interests
and pools la apparent in the movements of
many stocks. It Is also evident that the public
Is In the market. The buying by commission
houses, in fact, has been on an enormous scale.
Moreover, It is the general testimony that the
amount of stocks purchased for Investment and
taken out of the street is exceedingly large,
this tendency being Illustrated by the compara
tive scarcity of many high-grade dividend-pay
ing stocks and the ease with which they ad
vance on moderate buying.
In the bond market also the lack of offerings
of gilt edge securities has transferred the de
mand to new or second grade railroad mort
gages, some of which show substantial ad
vances.
eewjful, . as call money has ' not been quoted

Special Dispatch to The Call
VANCOUVER, B'. C. Dec. 28.â The
alarming decrease in the birth rate In the
centers of population In Australia has
caused much discussion throughout the
colonies and was recently brought up in
the Legislature of New South Wales,
where it caused a rancorous debate*,- It
was decided to appoint a royal commis
sion to inquire into the cause and inaugu
rate some method to overcome the present
conditions.
One member of the Legislature, Dr. A.
B Ross, charged that the great falling off
in the birth rate, as disclosed by carefully
prepared statistics, was attributable to
the host of private hospitals established
to treat alleged femaje diseases. The hos
pitals exist in scores in Sydney.
He /demanded to know the reason for
these institutions not having to make re
ports annually to Uhe Government, that
they might be Inspected and their. Iniqui
ties exposed. He urged the necessity of
criminally prosecuting those concerned in
their mismanagement.
The charities commission also recently
laid before the Legislature a report rec
ommending that private hospitals should
be registered and brought untfer : Inspec
tion, and gave details of cases which
caused many expressions of horror from
the Assemblymen.
Sir William Lyne, the Premier, In reply
agreed to the Immediate appointment of a
commission. He said that with the vast
territory cf Australia yearning for a
mighty population the decrease In births
has a signaficance more than ominous. He
also agreed that registration of hospitals
should be carried into effect as soon as
the law could be altered;

SOCIAL PROBLEM

WASHINGTON, Dec. 28.â Tho general
board of the navy, presided over by Ad
miral Dewey, has. taken up the question
of the transfer of the United States naval
station from Cavlte and its permanent es
tablishment on Subig Bay. At the same
time the special board of naval officers
now making Inquiries In the Philippines
as to the best t-ite for a permanent naval
station has cabled >. to Washington for a
full equipment of. boring apparatus. In or
der to learn whether there Is suitable
foundation at Subig Bay and other points
for the extensive drydocks and othe'
equipment of such a station. The bureau
chiefs wot'ld !Eke to make use of the ex
tensive building? already erected at the
Subig Bay station. These were put up by
the Spanish naval authorities, are in a
good state of preservation and are said to
offer bettei accommodations for the en
gineering and ether branches of the navy
than the buildings now in use at Cavite
The boring apparatus requested will be
shipped at once, but it will be fully two
months before It can be set up for use
The officials here expect that the borings
will disclose much difficulty in the way ot
securing suitable foundations for a per
manent station. About seventy-flve feet
of solid foundation Is required for a dry
dock, and there Is much doubt whether
this can be secured at Subig Bay. Sev
eral other points are being examined by
the board, and the borings will be carried
on at these points as well as-at Subig Bay.

PAUPER ALIEN FINDS j
AN UNKNOWN FRIEND
Porto Rican Whose Status Was in
Doubt Vouched For by a
Stranger.
NEW YORK, Dec. 2S.â Alfonso Gomiez
y Stanley, a native of Porto Rico, who
was detained at Ellis Island Wednesday
as a pauper 'alien, was allowed to depart
to-day with the question of his citizen
ship still undetermined. After waiting
two days in the hope that the Treasury
Department would make a ruling in the
case, help came to the puzzled Immigra
tion officials from an unexpected source.
A philanthropic woman agreed to be re
sponsible for the man's maintenance, and
he was released without delay, as there
was no further reason for his detention,
no matter what his political status.
If the case had not taken this unex
pected turn it would have come up for set
tlement in the same way as did that of
George Cruse. The latter was a Porto
Rican and was brought here by the Her
ald to test the political status of Porto
Ricans In the United States. He was de
tained, but Secretary Gage, avoiding the
question at issue ordered his discharge.
The Secretary or the Treasury said he
preferred to have the United States Su
preme Court decide as to Cruse's citizen
ship. This was last April, but no deci
sion has yet been rendered.

To-day the Porto Rican was allowed to

previous correspondence in regard to the
case.

quiry in regard to the death of former
Cadet Oscar L. Boos; will be finished at
the West Point Military Academy to

that cadets had been hazed to a degree
of exhaustion. The victims mentioned

Haskell. ,
MacArthur himself denied that he had
convulsions, but acknowledged that he
had been exercised to such an extent that
he had cramps In his muscles and that he
lost_ control of them. Haskell is not In
?he corps now so ( .hat his testimony was
not available.
Cadet Elliott J. Dent of Pennsylvania
said he had been hazed when, a fourth
class man but he had not to go to the
hospital In consequence. He told of being
punished for refusing to reveal . to the
authorities of the academy the names of
the cadets who hazed him.
Q.â Did you know Cadet Booz? A.â He 'was
pointed out to me, and I was told that he
was considered to be very worthless. -
Former Cadet John R. Doyle of- Phita.-
delphia. who was in the academy-., until
June, 1900, testified that he told v Boob
after his fight with Keller that M. ought
to have gone on.
He spoke in a way to me that showed that
hr was tired of the place and wanted to leave.

pepper sauce, us much as a teaspoonful'and
a half at one time.
Q. â Who gave it to you? A. â Cadet Bender,
who was discharged. He began by giving me
a few drops. I think It was Bender who
started the giving of pepper sauce.
Q.â Did it hurt you? A.â No, sir; it was un
pieasant, but it had no Injurious effect that
1 know of. Â»
W. â Did you ever have to eat disagreeable
foods? A. â Yes, sir; on one occasion I had to
eat some preserved pineapple, but there was
plenty of quinine mixed up in it.
Q. â Did you know Cadet Breth, or know him
to be hazed? A. â Yes, sir; I eaw Cadet Bender
exercise him and saw him exercised to the
l<oint of exhaustion, but he went as far as
he could go. I knew him at the preparatory
srhool in Baltimore and there he was found
physically deficient by 'Major -Wynneâ I mean
to enter this academy.
Cadet M. N. Nichols of Connecticut said
he belonged to the third class and was in
camp in 1899. He was exercised then and
did 250 "eagles." He was also braced and
hung to the stretcher, but not all at the
same session.
Q.â Do you know of any cadet having fainted
after exercising? A.â Yes, I remember the
case of Cadet J. Haskell, who is not now in
the corps.
Q.â Did the authorities Investigate the mat
ter? A.-Yes, sir.
Cadet Ulysses S. Grant, grandson of the
late ex-President of the United States,
who Â«s a third class man, was the next
witness. He stands second in his class, the
leader of which Is Douglas MacArthur, a
son of General MacArthur, commander of
the United States forces in the Philip
pines. He was examined by General
Clous and said he was admitted to the
academy In 1899.
Q. â Were you hazed in that year? A. â Yea,
Mr: I did eagles, held out dumbbells, did foot
balls and other exercises and took part In prac
tical jokes and ridiculous thing*.
Q.â Was any cadet punished for hazing you?
A. â Yes, sir; an upper class man was caught
making the "eagle" and he vwas .dismissed.
Q. â Have. you known of any brutal hazing?
A. â No. sir; If there was I was not present.
Q.â Did you do any hazing 1 of fourth class
men yourself? A.â Yes, I made them "brace"
and do some foollph thing*.
Q.â Any exercising? A.â No, sir; there was a
class agreement against that.
Cadet Douglas MacArthur of Wisconsin,
leader of the third class, testified that he
had been hazed, but not to exhaustion.
When asked who had hazed him he in
quired: "Is it absolutely necessary that
I give the names, sir?"
General Brooke replied that it was and
the witness said:
"Mr. Dockery of the present second
class is the only one now In the academy."
"Do you know of any cadet fainting
from hazing?"
"Yes. J. J. Murphy of the present fourth
class. I assisted him to his tent. I found
him lying near the ice tank. He did hot
tell me what he had been required to do."
Witness said he had hazed fourth class
men himself, to take the rough edges off
and conceit out of them. The witness did
not attend the class meeting that voted
to abolish hazing, but he understood the
agreement did not include bracing.
He denied having been seized with con
vulsions, but admitted having been ex
ercised until he had .cramps in his
muscles. . " Â»
The" testimony of'Charles T. Leeds of
Massachusetts was substantially the same
as Cadet MacArthur" s as to hazing. He
eaid Cadet Caruthers was taken to the
hospital with a broken Jaw. as 'the result
of a fight.
Cadet John C. Pegram of Virginia was
recalled' and aumitted that he had know.i
cadets to faint from hazing.
"What case was this?"
"Did you ever hear of cotton being put
in cadets' mouths to keep them from cry-
Ing or being hysterical?" was asked.
"Yes, I heard of such a case," replied
the witness. â¢ â¢ â¢
"I was told that Cadet MacArthur hart
requested some upper class men to stuff
his mouth with cotton so that he could
not cry out hysterically, â¢ as he said he
could not control himself after some exer
cising."
"Why should he do this?"
"There was an officer near by at the
time and I was told MacArthur was
afraid he would hear him."
Lieutenant Colonel George B. Davis,
deputy advocate general. U. S. A., was
sworn and gfave a resume of the efforts
made by the authorities at the military
academy to eradicate the practice of haz
ing during the â¢ last thirty-five years.
Colonel Davis was graduated In 1871.
"Yanking" wag commonly talked of as
theform of hazing then. This is similar
to what is now spoken of as dragging men
from their beds with mattresses or blank
ets underneath them.
Witness said varicrs means of stopping
hazing had been tried until now, in 1900.
these efforts were crowned with very sub
stantial success through the co-operation
of the corps of cadets.
â¢ Lieutenant Colonel Otto L. Heln, com
mandant of cadets, produced several ex
tracts from his records for the last three
years, showing that_the penalties inflicted
for hazing in 1S28 hÂ»d been much greater
than In previous years. Cadet Booz, he
said, never made any complaint of His
treatment. Â¦-Â¦â¢Â¦.Â¦

TO PICTURE A STORY
Clever Work of E. R. -Jackson, an Ama
tuer Photographer.
OAKLAND, Dec. 2S.â To an Oak
land young man belongs the
credit of being the first to com
pletely illustrate a novel by
photographs, the figures being
posed to suit the incidents in the novel
and then photographed. The young man
who did the work is E. R. Jackson of
Last Oakland, and the book Illustrated Is
The Gentleman from Indiana," published
by a well known Eastern firm. Mr. Jack
son has just received notice that he has
been awarded the first prize in the world
wide competition that was open upon this
point.
The owners of th<? copyright upon "The
Gentleman from Indiana." in conjunction
Witti the Photographic Times, a magazine
Cievoted to amateur photography, ottered
a prizo of $100 and several medals for the
?Â£ St s^lT s nf Photographs illustrating
three different books. Thero were no re
nnctlons. and the competition was open
to all. Mr. Jockson was awarded the first
prize and a gold medal and. Mrs. Claude
Catch of Salem, Oregon, the Fccond. No
other set of pictures was considered of
enough merit even for a mention. There
were several hundred sets offered, and
the only prizes awarded came to the Pa
cific Coast.
Mr. Jackson chose "The Gentleman
from Indiana." and made twenty-five pic
tures, including chapter headings and tail
pieces. He used his friends liberally, tak
ing them out Into the hills and there pos
ing them and costuming them to fit the
Incidents of the story. There was lots of
lively incident in the story, shootings be
ing plenty, and there wa? no lack of good
subjects. Day after day Mr. Jackson took
his parties out into the hills back of Oak
land, dressed them as cowboys, gamblers,
country Sheriffs, country Â¦ editors, even as
colored people, and then posed them ac
cording to his interpretation of the story.
His set of pictures has been accepted,
and the next edition of "The Gentleman
from Indiana" will be illustrated with
photographs of Oakland young people
GERMANY NOT DESIROUS
OF BUYING ST. JOHN ISLAND
Official of the Foreign Office Denies
That the Government Is About to
Establish Coaling Station. \
BERLIN. Dec. 2S.â The Frankfurter Ze\
tung prints a letter from Copenhagen, in
which the writer says Germany intends
buylnjr the island of St. John for a coal
ing station if Denmark's negotiations with
the United States should miscarry. The
letter refers to the organization of a Ger
man syndicate for the purpose of acquir
ing land on the island of St. John.
A representative of the Associated Press
showed a Foreign Office official the letter
referred to. In reply the official said Ger
many had never even remotely thoupht
of acquiring a West Indian island. He
added that she recognized the United
States would have as just ground for ob
jections thereto as Germany would have
if she heard the United States was nego
tiating with Denmark for the purchase
of the island of Bornholm. The official
admitted that it may be true that Ger
man capitalists are trying to purchase
land on the island of St. John, but he
reiterated that the German Government
has absolutely nothing: to do with the
project. The Foreign Office regards the
letter as intended to bring pressure to
bear on the I'nlted States in hastening:
the purchase of the Danish Antilles.
LONDON, Dec. 29.â "The American and
Danish Governments are engaged in di
rect negotiations for the sale of the Dan
ish West Indies." says the Copenhagen
correspondent of the Daily Mail, "and
the Danish Minister in Washington will
shortly submit a proposal for the consid
eration of the American Senate."
STORY OF BLACKMAIL
TOLD AT THE INQUEST
Sensational Evidence Tending to Es
tablish the Identity of Rich
ardson's Murderer.
ST. JOSEPH. Mo.. Dec. 2S.â Two sen
sations resulted to-day from the evidence
adduced at the inquest over the murder of
Frank Richardson, the millionaire mer
chant, who was shot down in his own
home at Savannah, Mo., on Christmas
eve.
The first sensation was testimony estab
lishing the probable Innocence of the bus
iness partner of the murdered man, who
has been under suspicion as the mur
derer, it having been alleged that the
partner. Just previous to the murder, was
accused by Richardson of undue inti
macy with Mrs. Richardson.
The second sensation was the fact that
the testimony tended to fix the responsi
bility for the crime upon a woman and
her adviser, a traveling man, who are al
leged to have blackmailed the deceased
out of various sums of money, covering
a period of almost a year.
Mrs. Richardson was expected to take
the stand to-day, but darkness ap
proached before the third witness had
concluded his evidence.
Charles Stanton. superintendent of the
electric light station, testified concerning
Richardson's association with Goldie
Wnitehead. a young woman who resided
at Stanberry, Mo., with whom Mr. Rich
ardson had been on intimate terms, and
who appeared to be hounding him for
money. _

CLOSING QUOTATIONS.
WASHINGTON. Dec 28.â Senators Nel-
Bon and Turner^ sitting as a subcommit
tee of the Senate Commerce Committee
to-day, heard arguments in support of tha
measure now pending in the Senate pro
viding for the establishment of a national
standardizing bureau. Among those heard
were: Secretary Gage, Professor O- H.
Tittraan, superintendent of the Coast and
Geodetic Survey and also of the present
Bureau of Weights and Measures; Pro
fessor "W. S. Stratton, inspector of
Weights and Measures under the present
organization and professor of physics in
the Chicago University, and Professor H.
A. Rowland, professor ofphysics of Johns
Hopkins University. They urged the
growing importance of a complete stand
ardizing bureau under Government direc
tion. Secretary Gage represented that,
such an institution is becoming more and
more important as the years go by. His
opinion of the importance of the proposed
bureau, as well as that of the other wit
nesses, is summarized in a memorandum
printed for the use of the committee, of
which the following is an extract:
"Until recent years this work has been
oonflned to problems concerned with the
standards of length, mass, capacity and
temperature, but the increased order of
accuracy demanded in scientific and com
mercial measurements and the exceeding
ly rapid progress of pure and applied
Bcience have increased the scope of such
work until it includes many important
branches of physical and chemical re
search, requiring for its successful per-'
formance a complete laboratory, fitted for
undertaking the most refined measure
ments known to modern science. The in
troduction of accurate scientific methods
into manufacturing and commercial pro
cesses involves the use of a great variety
of standards of far greater accuracy than
formerly required. An accurate knowl
edge of the high temperature of a furnace
or a refinery, or the low temperature of a
refrigerating process, is often essential to
the economical work of the process.
'"Enormous commercial transactions
are daily based upon the reading of elec
trical measuring apparatus, inaccuracies
of which involve &reat injustice and finan
cial losses; hence, the national bureau
should be in a position to test electrical
standards of all kinds for commercial as
well as the most refined scientific work."
Professor Tittman made an argument
for the establishment of the bureau upo,n
constitutional grounds, calling attention
to the fact that the constitution empow
ers Congress to fix the standard of
weights and measures. He contended
that fixed standards lie at the foundation
of good government and called attention
to the measures adopted by Germany and
Great Britain in the direction pssposed by
the pending bill for this country.
The bill contemplates the erection of a
building in Washington for the use of the
bureau and for the selection of a com
plete staff to take charge of the work.
Secretary Gage of the Treasury De
partment and Various University
Professors Appear Before the
Sub-Committee.
Strong Argument in Support
of the Bill Pending in

NATIONAL BUREAU
OF STANDARDS
.CINCINNATI, Deo. 28.â Senator J. B.
Foraker has madÂ© . a jeply to the recent
speech at Ann Arborl Mich, of former
President? Benjamin Harrison, in which
Mr. Harrison criticized the Porto Rican
policy of the Government, characterizing
it as a departure from correct principles.
In a 'speech before the Manufacturers
Club of this city last night, Senator For
aker said on this point: " v^:"
All the questions arising upon the Porto
Rican legislation are soon to be passed upon
by â¢ the Supreme Court. Fon that reason I do
not care to discuss them at this time, but It Is
In order to say that the view taken by
Congress, Â¦ as reflected by that legislation, waa
creditable to the generosity, the patriotism and
the indu6trial,spirlt of the American people. We
found --Borto ,*Rlco as poor as poverty could
make her. â¢ She had no money, no credit, no
system of taxation of any kind. She wanted
a civil government and a revenue to support it.
We gave fcer a far more, liberal civil govern
ment that was ever given any Territory prior
to the Civil War, po Jar as participation in it
by 'her people is concerned, and we dealt by
her more generously in providing support for
that government than we have ever dealt with
any Territory. .
In requiring her to pay tariff duties on Im
ports from foreign countries we did only what
we did with Louisiana, Florida. California and
all our other Territories; but In allowing her to
put these duties, when collected. Into her own
treasury for the support of her local govern
ment we did what was never done before for
anybody else, for In other cases we have not
only required the payment of these same duties
but we have also required them, - when they
were collected, to .be paid Into the national
treasury at Washington for the benefit of the
whole country. As to duties on commerce be
tween Porto Rico and the United States, we
did not levy 15 per. cent, r-at we remitted 85 per
cent of the existing rates on a number of arti
cles, and the whole duty on all the rest. We
further provided that the 15 per cent should
be remitted on or after March 1. 1902, or sooner,
if the Legislature of Porto Rico shall so pro
vide, and that in the meanwhile all collections
of this 15 per cent, both there and in the United
States, shall be paid over to Porto Rico for her
own support. We made this provision because
it was the easiest and least burdensome way
possible to raise indispensable revenue for their
government, and not because it was In any
sen3e a benefit to either our. Government or our
people.
The Porto Rtcan Legislature is now in ses
sion, but neither that body, nor any member of
It, nor anybody else, has taken' any step to re
peal or -alter the tax system so Imposed by
Congress. On the contrary, all concerned alike
testify to the hlgrhest satisfaction with what
Congress has done, Â¦ and the request Â¦will be al
most unanimously made that the provisions
enacted may be continued. If not indefinitely at
least until some satisfactory system of proper
taxation may be substituted.
Yes, it is true that the legislation for Porto
Rico was a "'departure." but it is not true that
It was a departure "from correct principles."
In addition it should be stated that Congress,
also in the same generous spirit exempted
Porto Rico from. all Internal revenue taxationâ
another favor never before extended to any
people anywhere.
Admits That a Departure Was Made,
but Denies That It Was
. "From Correct Prin- |

the Recent Speech of
Harrison.

The Southern Pacific TJnablÂ© to
Handle Big Crop of Citrus
Fruit.
Despite the precautions taken early In
the season, the Southern Pacific finds
itself unable to handle the big consign
ments of citrus fruit to'the East. Refrig
erator, cars are at present as scarce as
hen's teeth, and the company Is wonder
ing how it Is going to accommodate the
southern fruit growers, who have many
carloads of goods ready for shipment.
The scarcity of cars Is almost alarming
The total number sent out thus far this
season is about 2500. These cars ' are ex
ceedingly slow In getting back. For some
reason or other, they are being held In the
East, much to: the annoyance of the com
pany. - . . â - ,
The citrus fruit crop this season is esti
mated at 25.000 carloads. : It will therefore
be seen that only a very small percentage
of the crop has been shipped thus far. The
largest shipments are generally made in
January and February.
Discuss Social Evils.
The Municipal Leaguu of San Francisco
held a meeting In the Flood building yes

thereon, it being deferred until the next

part in the discussion.'
The Henschel Recitals.
The forthcoming appearances in Febru
ary of Mr. and Mrs. Georg.Henschel, the
distinguished vocalists and musicians,
will be a matter of pleasure and regTet
to society and musical circles. . Their re
turn here will be a pleasure, for their con
certs are without doubt the "most enjoy
able of any of the kind* iMr. Henschel
stands without a rival to-day as a vocal
ist, pianist and composer and his charm-
Ing wife is truly a "queen of song." Their
programmes are varied to a degree, rang
ing through the entire list of the classics.
Bach. Paislello, Handel, Beethoven,
Schumann, - Ambrolse Thomas, Gounod,
Donizetti, are but a few of the composers
interpreted by the-Henschels, forming a
veritable feast of melody. Arrangements
have been made for -six concerts to be
given by the Henschels at -the Metropol
itan Temple in February, and the sale of
season tickets will open at Sherman. Clay
& Co.'s music store. Kearny and Sutter
streets, or. January 7. Season tickets will
be transferable. Judging by the many In
quiries for tickets for. the season which
have already; been sent In. there is every
indication that the Henschel concerts will
be crowded and will be the. events of the
musical season.

Dead May Not Be Interred Within

I J Society Loses.
The action of the Board of Supervisors
in passing an ordinance prohibiting the
burial of the dead within the city: limits
is upheld by the Supreme Court. The lat
ter body handed down a decision yester
day in the case of the Societe Italiana di
Mutua Beneflcenza against the city and
county of San Francisco, affirming the
judgment of the lower court, which was
in favor of the municipality.
In 1897 the Supervisors passed an ordi
nance which prohibited the burial of the
dead in the City Cemetery, which was
also known as the Golden Gate Cemetery
The Italian society had been given, many
years previous to the bringing of the suit
lots In the cemetery and they were op
posed to giving up their burial place. Suit
was brought against the city and county
and the defendants filed a demurrer
which was sustained. An appeal was tak
en by the society and the Supreme Court
in affirming the action of ! the Superior
Judge held that the Board of Supervisors
did not have a right to grant land to pri
vate corporations, as "the land had been
turned, over to them by an act of Con
gress. The, court also held that the Su
pervisors possessed the right to pass any
ordinance which was for the good of the

MERCHANTS' ASSOCIATION
FAVORS PACIFIC CABLE
Resolutions Are Adopted and For-

That the Merchants' Association strong
ly advocates the construction of a cable
between the United States and the Ori
ent was evidenced at a meeting of that
organization yesterday when strong reso
lutions on the subject were drawn up and
forwarded to the California delegation in
Congress. The board of directors of the
association, composed of F. \V. Dolir
mann, C. S. Benedict, F. P. Cole, A. Si.
Davis, AV. J. Dutton. J. D. Grant. Mar
shall Hale. A. J McNIcoll. Hugo Roths
child and Frank J Svmmes. met in the
rooms of the organization and unani
mously adopted the resolutions, which are
as follows:
- Whereas, Owing to the present Indirect cable
connections between the United States and tne
Orient, the rates for the transmission of mes
fag'es to points in the Orient are now exces
sively liich and the time consumed in transmis
sion is exceedingly long;; and
Whereas. No connection ; by cable exists at
the present time with the Hawaiian Islands;
and
Whereas, The rapidly growlne commercial
and Governmental relatlonb with our newly ac
quired American possecsions in the Pacific de
mand the early construction of a direct Pacific
Ocean cable under American control; therefore,
be It
Resolved. That the Merchants' Association
hereby favore the construction at the earliest
possible date of a direct Pacific Ocean cable,
starting from San Francisco and constructed by
or with the- alii of the ITnited Staten Govern
ment and maintained under the control of the
United States Government:
Resolved, That copies of these resolutions be
forwarded to the California delegation in Con
gress. '
Rev. Dr. Jacob Voorsanger at the Tem
ple Emanu-El last evening spoke of the
passing century and of the advent of the
new. He urged his hearers to strive In a
spiritual way to emulate the example of
Napoleon's illustrious grenadier whose
name, heard at roll call, was always fol
lowed by the words, "Fallen on the field
of glory." Using a. similar metaphor, he
depicted the parsing century as the veter
ans of the war of -1S30 between Holland
and Belgium, who were entitled to appear
at muster every year. So the old century,
straightening up once more before him
who sees all centuries in review, might
offer the last salute.
The present century had been great In
achievement. The great men who were
in the world when the century began
would be astounded if they could realize
the mental advancement of the present.
Each succeeding century inherited from
the preceding "centuries something. The
Nile had deposited debri3 until the land
at Its mouth had been raised forty feet.
Every man should try In the coming cen
tury to lay down something for the benefit
of the future, just as the Nile has done.
The greatest inheritance of the centuries
was the knowledge of the living God that
it had from Judea. rich as were the lega
cies of law from Rome, plastic art front
Greece, .commerce from Phoenicia and
other gifts from other nations and lands.
As the old century passes men should
promise to go on. not only as for battle,
but for the honor of the living God, who
shall be after earth shall be no more.
Rev. Dr. Nieto at the Sherith Israel
Synagogue delivered a sermon In which he
ignored the calendar. The duty of man

If he would jjo out to benefit his fellow

speak the doctrine of eternal punishment.
Neither must be go speaking as the rep
resentative of any church 1 or any creed.
Carrying the message of God's love, he
would benefit, and advance the time to
come.

COMING CENTURY
VERTICAL HANDWRITING
. ' CONTROVERSY IS ENDED
Supreme Court Holds That the Shay
lor System Now Used Was
Legally Adopted.
Ginn & Co., the Boston publishers who
control the Shaylor system of vertical
round handwriting which is partially used
In -the. schools of this city and county,
won a victory in the Supreme Court yes
terday. The contract entered into be
tween, the. Board of Education and the
Eastern corporation was declared to be
valid and the effort made by J. C. Greene,
a' citizen and taxpaver. to enjoin the
board from using the Shaylor system was
unsuccessful.
The facts in the controversy are inter
esting. â¢ J. C. Greene is an engineer em
ployed by II. S. Crocker & Co. It appears
that the Board of Education entered into
a contract with the latter company to use
the California system of vertical hand
writing in the public schools and later
contracted to use the Shaylor system.
Greene then brought suit to enjoin the
board from using the Eastern system
until four years after the 9th of June,
1S97. Ginn & Co. asked and were given
leave to enter the suit as intervenors.
Greene was successful in the lower court
and Glnn &. Co. appealed. The Supreme
Court holds that the California system
was not legally contracted for and that
the board hnd the right to enter into a
contract with Glnn & Co.

Bell Scene in the "Heart of Maryland" Provides a
Thrilling Experience, for Miss Effie Darling, Who
Must Swing With the Bell so No Sound Be Heard
The subcommittee of nine, appointed by
the conference committee on a new pri
mary law to draft a measure for sub
mission to it, held a meeting Thursday
night at the rooms of the Union League
Club in the Palace Hotel and decided to
report favorably a measure drafted by A.
Ruef â one that possesses unique features
that meet the approval of nearly all the
lawyers and practical politicians that
have examined it. '
The conference committee, which con
sists of representatives from the leading
political clubs and the county central
committees of the two parties and from
other kindred organizations, will meet
next Thursday night in the Union League
clubrooms to consider the committee's
report. Its approval of a particular urali
of a primary election la\\Â» will place be
hind such measure an effective element
working for its passage by the Legisla
ture.
The distinctive feature of the Ruef pri
mary law is the provision to prevent com
binatjons of elements of the opposing par
ties. This is done by providing for the
signing of a declaration of party affilia
tion by the voter at the preceding general
biennial election.
Following is a portion of that section of
the measure as drafted:
It shall be the duty or the Inspector of Eleci
tlons at the time such elector offers to vot*
at said preceding biennial election to ask the
voter if he desires at that time to designate
which political party he desires to affiliate with
at the primary elections which shall Intervene
before the next genera! biennial election, and
to Inform the voter that unless he now makes
such designation he will not be entitled to vote
at such primary elections, and at the same
time he shall hand to the voter a printed blank
certificate In substantially the form herein
above set forth, which blank certificate such
voter may then sign or not, as he may desirt.
In order that no line on the vote of the
person so declaring- may be given, the cer
tificate shall be sealed in an envelope by
him. and in that form returned to the
Registrar of Voters or other registration
officer and not opened until the time has
arrived for making up the rolls for tho
primaries.
From the?e certificates a roll is made
up for each party, and at the primary the
voter Is furnished with the ballot of his
party In accordance with his declaration.
The man who voted at the preceding gen
eral election cannot vote at the primary
unless he has filled out the blank certifi
cate as described. There are other provi
sions which provide for the voting at the
primaries of those who had no vote 'at
the preceding general election; also for
voting at primaries preceding the jiext
general election.
The law Is made mandatory ohly in
towns exceeding- 5000 in population;. Klse
where there must at least be primaries of
the old sort held; delegates to conventions
may not be appointed.
The Ruef draft follows the Strati on law
on all points of the latter approved by tho
Supreme Court.
By Its Provisions Voters Must De
clare Intention as to Party Af
filiation at Preceding Gen
eral Election.

If you intend renting or buying
a piano, investigate Sherman, Clay
& Co.'s new plan. It is very dif-
ferent from the old installment
plan. Their new plan enables j'ou
to purchase a fine high-grade piano
and make payments of only $6 a
month.
Why, think of it! Merely renting
a piano costs you nearly that much,
and you never own the piano.
This new rent contract plan has
many other commendinK features
that are of* advantage to you, so
suppose you call and investigate! .; -'
NOTE.â Should you desire to
exchange the piano purchased for
a. Steinway, at any time w;thin
three years, you will be allowed the
full purchase price.
