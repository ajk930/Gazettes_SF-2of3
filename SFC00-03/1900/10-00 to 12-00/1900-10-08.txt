that the Republicans may. pick up a few
seats in the mountain States. They have
been encouraged to believe that three or
four States In that region which sent op
position members to the present House
will ijo Republican this year, and that
McKinley may pull the Congressional
ticket through. The question of which
party shall control the House of Repre
sentatives may depend altogether on the
size of the vote that is got* out In New
York and Pennsylvania. Republicans be
lieve lhat If McKinley carries these States
by majorities at all approximating those
of four years ago, they will gain from
ten to twelve seats In the House In these

WASHINGTON. Oct. 7.-Satlsfled now
that they will win the Presidency, Repub
lican campaign managers are very un
easy about the next House of Represent
atives. It la entirely possible that Presi
dent McKinley will be re-elected by a
large majority of electoral votes, and that
the Democrats might have a great ad
vantage over the Republicans for the rea
son that in their stronghold in the solid
South almost every State that gives Its
electoral vote to Bryan is sure to send a
solid Democratic delegation to Congress.
In the Republican strongholds, however,
many States will have broken delega

for McKinley, and yet the Democrats will

Republican Managers Fighting Hard
CHICAGO. Oct. 7.â Surrounded by
men and women of the congrega
tion, with the benediction of Rev.
Peter Moerdyke of the Trinity
Dutch Reformed Church \ yet
sounding In his ears. Governor Theodore
Roosevelt of New York to-day was set
upon by boys and young men, who heaped
epithets upon him, cursed him In the pres
ence of women and children and followed
his carriage hurling mud and profanity
after him.
"Who shot a Spaniard in the back?"
"Here he comes â the ."
"We've got a chunk of ice for you,
you ."
These were the mildest of the saluta
tions which shocked the ears of those who
followed Roosevelt out of church. Women
and children, horrified, drew back Into
the sanctuary. Roosevelt paused for' a
â¢Â¦moment, white with rage.
"Go to hell, >ou ," yelled the fore
most ruffian.
Curtis Guild Jr. saw what was coming.
He had Roosevelt by the arm and whis
pered:
"For God's sake, Theodore.^ don't say a
word â don't do anything. Get Into your
carriage."
But Rcosevelt was furious. He had
neither cane nor umbrella, and for a mo
ment he stood before his lnsulters the
picture of impotent and Insulted anger.
His tormenters danced around and away
from him. It was the first time since he
came into the West that respectable
women had been made to hear In his
presence such scurrility. But Guild
grabbed him by the arm a* he opened the
carriage door nnd almost shoved the Gov
ernor into it.
"Drive to the Annex," yelled Guild lo
the driver. A moment later the vehicle
was dashing down Harrison street with
a dozen yelling, cursing, mud-throwing
boys In pursuit.
Mr. Moerdyke, pastor of the church, was
left standing in the doorway, whither he
had 'followed the Governor, appealing
vainly for a policeman to arrest the rut
fians. Before the policeman arrived the
rabble had gone after Roosevelt's car
riage.
That was the ugly finale to what had
previously been a model daj; of rest and
worship for the Republican Vice Presi
dential candidate. With nls college mate
and friend, Curtis Guild Jr.. he set out
from the Auditorium Annex for the
church at 9 o'clock. When they sat
down, Mr. Moerdyke came to meet them
and shook hands.
The sermon was a dissertation upon
heroes of the Bible. When the benedic
tion had been pronounced, Mr. Moerdyke
came forward, and, addressing Roosevelt,
said:
"I know that It would be cruel to ask
you. Brother Roosevelt, to address my
little congregation, but If you will stand
up and greet us one and all, we will
thank you."
Roosevelt stood up In his place, and,
turning to the pastor, said that he could
not If he would and would not If he could
preach a sermon now.
"But," he added, "I expect to come back
to Chicago next winter, and I will certain
ly come to worship here. You have been
very hospitable to me and if the opportu
nity comes then I will give you a lay ser
mon, using for my text the words 'Be ye
doers of the Word and not hearers only.' "
Then he shook hands with all who ap
proached and went out Into the street to
encounter Insults.
When seen to-night Governor Roosevelt
refused to make any comment upon' the
experience he had at the church.
Curtis Guild Jr., the college mate of
Governor Roosevelt, and companion on his
stumping tour, says that the hoodlums
who insulted the Governor as he, was
leaving the church wore "Chicago Amer
ican" hats. Rough Riders, who were the
Governor's escort last night, say that the
hostile demonstrations in front of cheap
saloons on Fifth avenue were led by half
grown men carrying Mr. Hearst's paper.
ANXIETY AS TO THE HOUSE.
Agciin has Governor Theodore Roosevelt of Nezv York, Republican candidate for the Vice
Presidency, been singled out for mob attack. While emerging from a Chicago church at the close of di
vine services yesterday, he was attacked by a crowd of roughs. Insulting epithets zverc hurled at the
New York executive and lie zvas pelted ivttJt mud as he zvalked to his carriage. Furious tenth rage,

Out in Support of
McKinley.
T^ -j E"W YORK. Oct. 7.-With only a
g^Vf rnont h of the campaign remaining
Â¦ IB an unprecedented condition of
* affairs prevails In the State of New
York. The Empire State, with its
thirty-six votes, has been the determining
factor in many Presidential elections, yet
it is practically at political peace and the
election only four vre^ks away. No na
tional candidate on either ticket has been
In the State to make a speech. No cam
paigning of moment has been done.
Â¦vTMe New York may not be the pivot
upon which this election will turn, sup
porters of Mr. Bryan frankly admit that
he must carry it to win. On* the other
hand, it Is clear a? day that if New York
should co for Bryan it would be carried
t>y a lardslide that would sweep with it
a. half-dozen other States that are appar
ently stanchly Republican now. Nothing
but a political revolution could give New
York to Eryan and such a political revo
lution would be l:ke!y to carry New Jer
sey, Connecticut and most of the States
cf the Middle "West.
Meantime all New Tork eyes have been
turned on other States. The drift in In
diana Jnst now seems to bÂ« in favor of
the Democracy. Bryan has not this time
been confronted with great audiences
wearirp golden rr>d as he was in 1KKL The
Republicans are evidently preparing to re

NEW YORK, Oct. 7.â In an .edi
torial which will appear in to
morrow's New Yorker Staats
Zeltung that newspaper unqual-
ifiedly comes out In favor of
McKinley. though It chooses him as "the
lesser of two evils." The editorial In part
follow? :
Our estimate of the dangers connected with
President McKlnley's colonial policy has un
dergone no change. We are not only firmly
cÂ«nvlneod that the Philippine Islands will
never repay in material advantages thÂ« sayi
fices made for their possession, but we are also
satisfied beyond all doubt that the continuation
of the policy of conquest must hopelessly cor
rupt our public life and either destroy our free
institutions entirely or at least compel us to
engage in a severe struggle for their preserva
tion, not to mention the dangers of foreign
complications. Furthermore, we are fully
aware of the fact that Mr. McKlnley's elec
tion will bÂ« Interpreted and exploited as a vic
tory of Imperialism, even if It has been caused
by distrust of Mr. Bryan's teachings and char
acter.
In spite of all this we consider a Republican
victory less dangerous for the welfare of the
nation than the election of William J. Bryan.
He has shown in his formal letter of accept
ance and In numerous speeches delivered since
then that he has not learned, cannot and will
not learn, anything In regard to the financial
question: that his Ignorance and lack of per
ception In this direction are Incurable. He
must be considered the greater immediate dan
ger. His election would undoubtedly produce
widespread disturbance of present economic
conditions, from which hardly anybody
escape and which would subject a large part
of the American pecple to severe suffering.
It la not well to rely too firmly upon the
hope that Congress will not contain a majority
friendly to silver. Lack of confidence in Wil
liam J. Bryan's character is so pronounced that
hli election would euJflce to produce Brave
economic convulsions, even If his hands were
completely tied. But he can do untold harm
without the anslRtanee of Congress. And we
must consider that hi* election would be In
terpreted by politicians ea a victory for silver.
Many of the Senators and Representatives who
are bow eppeeed to free coinage have voted for
it before when they thought * majority of the
people desired it, and they wouH do so again.
Bryan's extreme views on the financial
question and recent utterances regarding
the dangers of a standing army have
driven to McKlnley's support two power
ful newspapersâ the Chicago Record and
the New York Btaats Zeltung.
In Maryland the fighting Is becoming
very furious. The money Issue is being
gradually forced to the front and during
the last week the campaign has very
nearly assumed the lines of battle of 1S36.
Maryland, which has been conceded to
Bryan, may now be considered debatable
ground.
There Is no change in the situation in
n.Â»y of the New England or Middle States.
The Republicans in Delaware are holding
their own and are having the better of it

SAMOANS AS SOLDIERS
Commander Tilley Believes the Isl

Artillerists.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 7.â Having found
the natives of Tutuila fit to serve as
policemen and able to maintain peace and
order. Commander Tilley believes they
would make excellent soldiers to man
the fortifications to be erected for the de
fense of the harbor of Pago Pago.
Commander Tilley has not, so far as can
be learned, recommended that a regiment
of Samoan? be organized, but Sn private
letters to officers on duty here he has in
dicated that they would make effective
artillerymen. Several months ago he
made an official recommendation that a
battery of tight and six inch guns be In
stalled at strategetlc points at Pago
Pago, and declares that with their aid
and the proper location of mine fields the
harbor will be rendered absolutely im

To enlist a rtgiment of natives it would

from Congress. The natives who are now

NEW YORK, Oct. 7.â The bo"dy of a
young woman who committed suicide Sat

and papers found in her clothing, with
three letters written by her on the hotel

Per Cent Increase.
2>oubt as to What Is Meant by a Ten
BCRANTOX, Pa., Oct. 7.â Now that a
convention to consider the 10 per cent of
fer is assured, attention Is turned to what
the companies moan by a 10 per cent in
crease to the miner and his helper.
Th<? miner works by contract and pays
the laborers out of his earnings. As" a
rule the miner cuts six loads of coal, for
â¢which he gets $Â»j SO. Out of this he pays
for powder, oil and repair for tools arid
the wagep of his helper. The laborers'
pay is nxed at so much per day and in
this region it averages about $1 75. After
paying the expenses the miner has about
|2 30 left for himself. Ten per cent ad
vance gives the miner 63 cents extra per
day. The laborer wants his 10 per cent,
or IS cents, and as a consequence the
miner must be content with 45 cents or
7 per cent. But in many Instances a miner
has two laborers. Thl3 means that 36
cents must come out of his 63 cents and
the miner linds himself enjoying an ad
vance of only 5 per cent.
Just how tne operators want this offer
interpreted is not known here. The lo
cal operators say that the men who
framed the offer either did not have in
mind that the minÂ«:r pays the laborer, or
else, having it in mind, figured the laborer
cut of consideration altogether, leaving
Jt for the miner and laborer to settle
among themselves which portion of the 10
per cent the laborer would receive The
laborers will not. it is thought, be con
tent with anything less than a full 10
per cent rai*e and it is this which It is
thought will cause a hitch when the con-
Ttuuon comes together.

Of late there has been considerable
scouting and skirmishing in the provinces
of Abra and North Ilocos, though without
decisive results. It Is obvious here that
the maneuvers of the Filipinos are more,
skillful than formerly ana that the field
tactics of ihe Americans are being fol

Benor MatÂ«nl, the founder of the so

and lodged in Jail in Manila, has been lib
erated. As he had always persistently
refused to take the oath of allegiance to
the L'nited States Government he had
maintained his reputation among the
Filipinos as a resolute patriot. They now
believe that he has reached a private unÂ»

consequently he has lost some'" of " his
popularity, although he is still considered
the leader of the dormant revolutionary

WROUGHT BY

WASHINGTON*. Oct. 7.â Captain Frank
West of the Sixth Cavalry, acting super
intendent of the Sequoia and Genera'.
Grant national parks, in California, has
submitted his annual report to the Sec
retary of the Interior. The first of these
parks Is the larger, containing, it is esti
mated, from 160) to 3000 of the mammoth
sequoia trees for which California la
noted. Captain West says for the benefit
of the public, as the best route for reach
ing the piant forest is not generally
known, that the proper point at which to
leave the railway is Visalla. Tulare Coun
ty Thence there Is a good road through
the parklike country to the Kewaeh Riv
er leading thence through the Ash Moun
tains into the park. The- park itself Is on
a high tableland from 6300 to io00 feet in
altitude, and commands a view of some
of the most magnificent mountain scenery
in the Sierras. He recommends In some
detail the extension of the park bounda
ries to take In a portion of this mountain
tract, eastward to Mount Whitney and
the main Sierra, divide and northward to
take in the King River Canyon. This sec
tion. Captain West Bays, exceeds in
beauty and grandeur anything to be found
In Switzerland and Is a part of the public
domain unfitted for agriculture, but of
Importance as a game preserve and to
conserve the water supply on which the
Immense clÂ«rus fruit Interests of Tulare
County depend.
The General Grant Park Is only two
miles square and Is in very bad condition,
owing to fallen timber and rubbish, which
should be cleared away Immediately. It
contains over 21i> large sequoias. Includ
ing the famous General Grant tree, and a
little work would make it a marvelously
beautiful spot.
One serious danger which threatens the
sequoia park is the presence of sawmills
6n private lands included within the
boundaries of the park. It Is said there
are 5440 acres so held. The mills are
ruining the giant trees in their neighbor
hood, using them In the most criminally
wasteful manner, taking only the clear
timber and lf-aving the immense tops to
rot on the ground and be a menace by
fire to all the remainder of the park.
Captain West recommends that these
lands be appraised speedily and pur
chased by the Government.
There "has been little trespassing by
sheep and cattle in the park this season,
but poachins and the indiscriminate
slaughter of game as soon as the soldiers
leave for the season threaten to exter
minate the larger animals. Captain West
recommends an aggregate appropriation
of $21,000 for earning forward the various
lines of work next year.

ENGLAND AGAINST /AMERICA.
BERLIN, Oct. 7.â Influenced by the lat
est diplomatic events in China and by
the remarkable ease of the money mar
ket, the Boerse last week had the best ex
perience it has had for months. The fact
i that the fo^eicn powers regard the China
situation as more favorable had a great
weight with operators. The fall of Vi
per cent in private discount on Monday
and Tuesday acted favorably on the mar
ket and this Influence was maintained un
til Friday, when the rate rose %.
The Boerpe presented a completely
changed aspect from that of previous
months. All classes of securities showed
improvement until Friday, when the rise
was checked. This was followed by rather
heavy falls yesterday, but the week's
trading shows a moderate rise.
The so-called "New York Treasuries"
gained 25 cents, the demand continuing
"above the supply, and Chinese loans
gained from 2 to 4 points.
Coal and Iron shares rose steadily until
Friday.- notwithstanding the gloomier re
ports from the iron centers. The weak
ness of the iron situation is apparently
growlng. some reductions in wages and
discharges of operatives having been re
ported. Manufacturers of structural iron
in Germany are trying to find relief for
the dullness of the home market by un
derbidding Belgian manufacturers.
The ccal situation remains strong, but
the opinion prevails that the scarcity will
soon be over." The syndicate has decided
to raise prices In the casÂ» of a few grades
after April. German cokers are offering
coke at Liege cheaper than the Belgians.
It is understood that discounts at the
Reichsbank during the present week will
be heavy. The New York Exchange range
hns risen near the gold point and fear Is
expressed that German gold will go to
Npw York.
The organ of Dr. von Mlquel. Prussian
Minister of Finance, the PoUtlsche Nach

OLYMPIA. Wash.. Oct. 7.â David P. j
Lister is lying at his home suffering from
severe burns received from molten iron,
and that he is alive to tell of hla ex
perience Is a source of wonder. Lister
Is foreman of the molding room of the
Pioneer Iron Works. Yesterday after
noon a "heat" was run off, when hot
metal is poured Into molds of sand.
A ladle containing 400 pounds of molten
metal had Just been drawn off from the
furnace, and preparation were being
made to pour it into the mold. At thl-Â«
juncture an employe threw into the hot
metal a piece of cold cast iron. In an
instant hot metal was flying in all direc
tions.
Lister was standing near and received
the full force of the flying metal. The
effect of hot Iron under these circum
stances is much like duckshot from a
gun. It perforates everything it strikes.
Lister was struck In the back and slde3.
Much hot metal ran down inside his
clothing to his shoes. His back was
riddl<*l, as was also his sides and legs,
and had not his shirt and other clothing
been torn from him he must have been,
burned alive.
Buckets of water were thrown upon tho
suffering man and temporarily relieve 1 !
him. That he was not burned to death
seems strange, as the hot flying iron
literally covered him.

His experiments were conducted In New
Guinea, where a large number of natives
die yearly of malaria. Dr. Koch's treat
ment consists â¢ of giving the patients a
medicine he has discovered, the chief in
gredient of which is quinine. This Is for
both curative and .preventive purposes.
He also found It necessary to expel mala
rial parasites, chief among which were
mosquitoes. Last spring, when condi

chance to possess themselves of a portion
of the cold which was being taken out,
and one Saturday evening last month the
chance came.
This Saturday was a busy day and when
the gang knocked off work irv the evening
the sluices had not been cleaned up. An

to their chagrin that their work was done,
for there lay the sluice boxes empty and
clean. It is estimated that the thieves
got about $1500 from these boxes. Their
other hauls were smaller ones.

The Russian torpedo boat destroyer
Som, built by Laird's, Birkenhead, Is al
most ready for trial. The boat is 213 feet
by 21 feet 6 inches, and displaces 350 tons
on 6 feet 3 Inches mean 'draught. She Is
fitted with Laird water tube boilers and
twin s'crew engines of 6000. horsepower,
calculated to give a speed of twenty-seven
knots during a three hours* run. the boat
being loaded down to service conditions
with eighty tons of coal on board. The
contract price Is J2CO.00O if the boat cornea
up to the requirements, and is subject to
a deduction of $10,000 for every one-quarter
knot short of, the contract. If the speed
falls below twenty-six knots the Govern
ment reserves the right to either reject
the vessel or to accept It at a reduction of
20 per cent from the contract price.
The French battleship Hoche, built in
1886, has been fitted out with new engines,
but the first trials were so unsatisfactory
as to require extensive improveflaents and
alterations of the new machinery. With
10,912 horsepower the speed was 15.92
knots, but the consumption of coal was so
great as to make the supply sufficient for
only S03 knots at the highest speed. This
defect has now been remedied and the
speed has reached sixteen knots, while
the coal will suffice for 1292 knots. Nu
merous alterations have been made in the
vessel and the draught has been material
ly reduced by. removing superstructure
and substituting lighter guns for the
original armament. The Hoche will be
ready for service during October.

If grit and perseverance can make an
actress, then Gertrude Lewis is destined
to be one of the dazzling bunch of shin
ing stage lights that have come out of
this Golden State. Last winter Gertie
forsook the joys of local social life to win
smiles of approval from the generous but
hard-to-please audiences that pay their
$2 50 per head to enjoy the shows Froh
man mounts on the classic Daly stage In
Xew York. Gertie did not have much to
say in the Frohman productions. Her
speaking part in the first play of the sea
son was limited to "Yes. mamma." How
ever, in the playing of it she had the
moral support of a gorgeous' Persian
lamb "automobile" coat, besides the sat
isfaction of knowing that after she made
her exit the feminine portion of the audi
ence paid no further attention to the play.
The plot was lost (to them) In specula-

was exactly surprisedâ no ' one is these
days at the announcement of an engage

just that day, and therefore it may be set
down as one of the unexpected features
of the affair. It was a most congenial
party, and if the society editor was mak
ing a note of 1 it he would write "among
those present were Mr?. Alexander Keyes,
Miss Olive Holbrook, Miss Susie Blandlng,
Miss Margaret Salisbury. Mlsa Margue

Th|E FIGHT IN THE SECOND.
CITIZENS of the Second Congressional District
are to be congratulated upon the opportunity
of obtaining jo able a man as the Hon. S.
D. Woods to represent them in Congress. A candi
date of the Republican party, pledged to Republican
policies and to a support of the Republican adminis
tration, he will be nevertheless a genuine representa
tive of the whole people, for he has lived in the
district for years, is well acquainted with all classes
of its population, knows its interests and-its needs and
can be counted on to be faithful and energetic in pro
moting' every measure calculated to advance its
welfare.
Mr. Woods came to California with his parents in
1849. At the age of seventeen he began teaching
school and among his pupils arc many who have since
risen to eminence in the State. In 1875 he was ad
mitted to the bar, but on account <3f ill health he
abandoned the profession of the law for a time and
ppent several years as a member of a surveying party
in the southern part of the State. Afterward he was
engaged in mining in Inyo. Yuba and Placer coun
ties. He also made a journey on horseback from- San
Francisco through the central and northern parts of
the State and into Oregon and Washington, thus
making himself familiar by observation with the
resources and needs of those sections of the country.
In 18S5 Mr. Woods returned to Stockton and re
sumed the practice of law. He soon attained high
rank at the bar and is esteemed not only for his
learning and his force as an advocate, but for his
strict to his clients and his firm maintenance
of the best traditions and highest standards of pro
fessional honor. His studies, however, have not been
confined to matters of law. He has given thought
and work to every important question that â¢ affects
the welfare of the State. The problems involved in
the impounding of mountain streams, the conserva
tion of the forests, the development of mining, the
preservation of the valleys from floods, the provision
Â£cr irrigation; and all subjects of that kind have
found in him a careful and earnest student. It may
be therefore said that his mind is stored with the
knowledge which will fit him to advocate with
efficiency the adoption by the Federal Government
of measures designed to* solve all problems of that
kind in a way to serve the interests of the mountain
and the valley counties alike.
Taking into consideration the diversified experi
ences of Mr. Woods, and also his personal character
and fitness for the office, the Republican Convention
of Santa Cruz could not have made a better choice.
Mr. Woods has always been a stanch Republican,
but has never taken an active part in politics." On
several occasions he has refused the importunities of
his friends to accept a nomination for office, but has
in each instance declined, and it was only after h-:
had been convinced that it was his duty as a citizen
and as a Republican that he finally consented to
enter the political arena.
He belongs to the optimistic class of Americans
who have an unfaltering faith in American institu
tions and in the destiny of this nation. He believes
that the planting of the American flag on other soils
is but the fulfillment of America's mission among the
nations of the world. He is an expansionist in the
broadest meaning of that word, and is an enthusi
astic admirer of President McKinley as a man and
as a statesman.
His vigorous personality and tireless energy will
place him at once in the front rank of the nation's
best law-makers.
He represents that typical class of Californians who
love California and who have faith in her greatness,
and whose broadminded, progressive and liberal spirit
has served to make men from the Golden State dis
tinctive wherever they are found.
Of high personal character and intense human feel
ing, Mr. Woods is a man who wins and holds friend
ships. Frankness is one of his most notable char
acteristics, making him a reliable man to care for all
of the interests ofthe people and a stumbling block
to would-b- manipulators. All the interests of Cali
fornia, and especially the interests of the Second
Congressional District, although they be diversified,
could be in no better keeping in Congress than in 1 the
hands of Hon. S. D. Woods.
THE BUSINESS BAROMETER.
AS far as figures are an indication trade through
out the country showed some improvement last
week. In the first place, the bank clearings
made a' better showing, the decrease from last year
falling to only 7 per cent, the smallest loss for a long
time. The falling off in New York was slight, being
7.2 per cent, while Chicago showed a gain of .05 per
cent, which, though insignificant, was the first increase
for months. The only explanation of this statistical
improvement in business comes from Wall street,
where strong financial interests have re-entered the
market upon hopes of the triumph of sound money
principles at the polls next month. As a political
straw this fact is very significant.
The money market in New York is decidedly firm
er, owing to heavy withdrawals for the South and
â¢West, but the weekly bank statement was better than
had been anticipated. The coal strike still operates
against any activity in Wall street, as the market
weakens or hardens in sympathy with the van-ing
aspects cf the situation.
The staples are generally in fair tone, and with the
exception of sugar there has been no marked decline
for some little time. Provisions rule very firm, and
hog products have generally advanced under a good
demand. There is little ordering ahead for any kind
of merchandise, and some diminution in the jobbing
trade is reported at several Western centers. This,
however, is due largely to the continued rain in the
Northwest, which restricts the movement of wheat to
market and consequently diminishes the retail and
jobbing demand for goods. With dryer weather, how
ever, this condition would undoubtedly pass away.
The indisposition to order ahead is particularly mark
ed in the iron trade, and the cruder forms of iron
continue weak and quiet. The boot and shoe factories
of New England are doing a more active business
on orders for immediate delivery, but spring business
is hanging back. Sales of wool are still behind those
of last year, but there has been no further decline in
prices worthy of remark. Considering the nearness of
the election the general condition of trade seems
rather favorable than otherwise.
The local markets show no particular change for
the week. Wheat was quiet and irregular all the week,
barley fell of? slightly, oats, bran and hay advanced,
beans declined under the influx of the new crop, bacon
und lard went up and sugar down, and hides met
Â¦with an improved inquiry. These variations, while
generally light, show more animation to business, and
are therefore a good sign. When prices fluctuate here
and there, going up and down according to the vary
ing proportions of the supply and demand, trade is
usually in healthy condition. Prolonged dullness is
a sinister symptom, but this condition has been absent
from the San Francisco market for several years.
The early rains, while heavier than the usual fall
in October, have thus far had no marked effect on
anything. The fruit has been pretty well dried, the
hay is under cover, and grapes are the only important
product in danger of suffering from wet weather.
Some damage has been done, but not enough to cause
any violent fluctuation in prices.
The local Civil Service Commission has been freely
criticized for refusing to accept experience as a quali
fication of any value :n applicants who want positions.
It is natural that the commission should not value
something which it does not itself possess. Â¦ /
The tourist season is over in Europe, and yet it is
said the attendance at the Paris Exposition is increas
ing, so it seems that as the natives are no longer
busy skinning foreigners they have a chance to go to
the show themselves.
Whatever else may be said of the Board of Educa
tion, it possesses the merit of candor. After it was
caught letting illegal contracts which aggregate

THE FIFtST VOTERS
7~1 MOXG the millions who will cast their ballots
/ \ at the coming election there will be many
thousands who never before have exercised
the right of suffrage in the choice of a chief magis
trate of the republic. They have attained to manhood
since the election of 1896 and are now called upon
to make choice between the two great parties of the
country and to express by their ballots the judgment
they make upon them. In closely contested States
the ballots of the young voters ma}' hold the balance
of power. They are, therefore, of importance to the
whole nation, and it is worth while for the foremost
statesmen of the land to make special appeals' to
them to vote right.
No appeal of that kind has' ever been more elo
quently or more' nobly made than that of McKinley
in his address to the first voters of Cleveland in 1890".
After reminding the young men that their fathers had
to pass through the civil war and all the years of
bitter sectional controversy that preceded and follow
ed the conflict, he said: "Born in the seventies, you
have enjoyed the most marvelous advantages of the
nineteenth century. You have witnessed the greatest
progress of science, mechanics and material develop
ment of any period in pur history. You have enjoyed
the advantages of the free and higher schools of
learning. You have lived in f a period of the greatest
opportunity for moral and intellectual growth, and
enjoyed most favorable conditions for forming right
opinions. You have escaped the extreme bitterness
of party divisions and the passions of a fratricidal
war. You carry none of the scars of the past party
conflicts."
Then proceeding' to the issues of that time, which
were virtually the same as those of to-day, Mr* Mc-
Kinley went on to say: "Surely every young voter
who has his spurs yet to win, his career to make, his
fortune to build, will hesitate before he will give his
ballot to a party which' seeks to create hostility
between classes and sections; between the rich and
the poor; between the mechanic and the manufac
turer; between the farmer and the banker. He will
cast his ballot to continue the equality of citizenship,
of privilege, of opportunity, of possibility, which
has been the boast of our citizenship, and is the very
cornerstone upon which our free institutions rest."
Then followed the direct appeal so timely to the
issues before us: "How would Lincoln, Grant, Gar
field and Logan have stood if in their time they had
accepted the dbctrint which some now teach,' that
because -they were poor and of humble, surroundings
they must go off by themselves and shut the door of
opportunity to the best impulses of their, souls, and
the' noblest aspirations of their minds? The ballot of
the young man. as well as that, of the old man, the
ballot of the first voter, as well as that of all voters,
should always express the voice of truth and con-
Against the logic of that argument, the strength of
that position, the mugwump -following of Schurz and
others will rage in vain. The supreme choice after
all is a choice of parties, and when Bryanism is under
stood in its full meaning, all good citizens, whether
they be annexationists or not, will find ample reason
for supporting the party that stands for everything
of law, order, honor and industry that maintains the
prosperity of the republic.
Then, bringing the argument to the issue, he says:
"I am opposed to imperialism. When the treaty with
Spain was before the Senate I did my best by speech
and by vote to amend it in accordance with the
doctrine I have stated. I was faithful to the cause o;
freedom and justice as I understood it. The cause
was stabbed in the back by Mr. Bryan In the moment
of its victor}'- I do not trust him now. I am not
prepared to purchase the chance of what he will do
hereafter at the price he demands â a Supreme Court
of his choosing: the solid South in the saddle: ten
million of American citizens at home disfranchised;
national dishonor; the free coinage of silver at sixteen
to one. He told his Populist audience the other dV/
that if he were elected they might be sure that this
monetary reform would be accomplished before the
next Presidential election. If you are ready to make
this purchase at this price, my independent friends, go
your way, do your duty as you see it. I shall do mine
as I see it. I think the future of justice and liberty
in the Eastern Hemisphere is safest in the hands in
which it is safest in the Western Hemisphere. I think
it is safest abroad where it is safest at home." *
The moral of the lesson taught by the contrast is
clear. If the men who are opposed to the annexation
of the Philippines hope to accomplish anything they
must act with an organized party. They can gain
nothing by mere agitation. In the selection of a
party they must choose that which is most likely to
serve the interests of freedom and the welfare of the
republic. Twice within recent years the independents
and mugwumps have voted with the Democrats and
helped them to elect a Democratic President; and
the Senator says if they like the results of the Demo
cratic administration they are welcome to the choice.
The Senator makes a strong contrast between wlut
was effected by Wendell Phillips and other independ
ents like him in fighting the slave power and that
which was accomplished by the politicians who form
ed the Republican party. He says: "After nearly
thirty years Mr. Phillips and his followers, had trade
no progress whatever. The thirty years of their
activity witnessed a series- of victories for slavery. .*
* * Now what was done by the politicians? Some
of us met at Worcester, Massachusetts, on the 28.I1 of
June, 1S4S, to found a new party devoted to arresting
the fciture encroachments of the 'slave power and to
secure the freedom of the vast territory between the.
Mississippi and the Pacific. * * * In eight years
it carried a majority of the free States. In twelve
years it elected its President and had a majority, in
both houses of Congress. In sixteen years it had
abolished slavery and had put down the rebellion;
and in twenty years it had adopted the three great
amendments to the Constitution which made every
slave a freeman, every freeman a citizen, and every
citizen a voter."
BY way of reply to the critics who condemn him
for supporting the Republican party while op
posing the Philippine policyof the administra
tion. Senator Hoar has contributed to the Interna
tional Monthly an article on party government in
the United States, in the course of which he points out.
tn.it in this country government can be effected only
by parties, and that whosoever hopes to have any
influence upon legislation must choose between one
p"arty or the other; nothing can Be effected by holding
aloof from parties or by shifting from one party to
another. because of special issues and without regar>l
to the character of the men who control the parties.
SENATOR HOAR'S DEFENSE.
YOU all want to be prepared for
the startling announcement of the
engagement of Bishop Potter's
adventurous nephew and the
daughter of a prominent local phy
sician, who does not rely solely upon her
papa's great name for a fame that Is hers
by virtue of her beauty, talent and tact.
Just at present the engagement is being
kept dark, and while we are all gossiping
about It, not one of us Is sufficiently brave
to come right out and tell it.
I have heard more than the mere fact
of the engagement. I have heard that on
the first of the month Mamie and her
mother will leave for the Philippines,
where" the wedding is to take place.
Corporal Potter is a man with a rosy
past and a brilliant future. When he
passed through our city on his way to the
Philippines 'accounts of hia escapades
filled several columns in the daily papers.
Besides escapades I believe he was once
before engaged to a Miss Carter of Phila
delphia. ;y^'
In the matter of a previous engagement
he is not ahead of his pretty fiancee.- She
had several years ago a heart-to-heart
affair with a popular young lieutenant of
the navy and the loss of the fair maid was
the penalty the naval constructor had to
pay for the possession of an ugly temper.

I got one genuine Jolly surprise during
the week â the announcement of the wed
ding of Ada Dougherty and Jabtsh Clem
ent. There was nothlrlg sensational about
the weddingâ just the case of an ardent.
Impatient .lover, who eould not bear to be
separated, from the lady of his choice,
who was about to leave for a prolonged
tour with a suffering mother. The recent
death of Ada's sister threw the mother
Into a' fearful nervous state and Mr. and
Mrs. Dougherty, their two sons and Ada
were about to start for an extended trip,
when Clement discovered that he couldn't
and wouldn't bear the pangs of separa
tion. The result was the wedding â a nat
urally nuiet one.
Everybody sympathizes with Mrs.
Dougherty in her trouble. Every time the
lady's name is mentioned there is always
some one by to recall days of lavish hos
pitality enjoyed, either at the town or
country home, and many musical even

were the delight of critical guests. I have

ordinary merit.

Mme. de Guigne, whose health for some
tim^ past has been very poor, is going
south to spend the winter months. This
will unfortunately take Miss de Guigne,
who is one of this season's debutantes,
out of town for a good part of the sea
son, for naturally she will want to be
near her suffering mother.
While on the subject of debutantes, I
want to say that I have been told that
Sophia Pierce is coming out thi9 winter,
but that she will not make her initial bow
to society until early In January.

The death of Colonel Jackson neces
sarily postponed the wedding of beauti
ful Lucy Jackson and Dr. Rothchild.
Their marriage, I understand, was to
have taken place some time this month
at the Jackson country seat at Napa Soda
Springs.
Lucy's engagement, which came as such
a surprise to all of us, has not yet ceased
to be a topic of interest. I don't be

voted lover as I the doctor, who, I am
told. Is a member of the world-famous
wealthy family whose name he bears.
The jewels which he has presented his
brido-to-be are- of sufficient quantity to
stock a small sized jewelry shop. He lets
no occasion pass without marking the
event with the gift of a jewel, and when
birthdays and holidays are exhausted the
generous doctor invents anniversaries. I
saw, the other day, a dazzling diamond
sunburst given by the doting doctor to

Some one who has just returned from

beautifully gowned, ns was naturally to

were marveling at her erect figure and
supple waist, and trying, without succeed,
to make their clothes "hang" like hers

SOCIETY: GOSSIPY BITS MOSTLY ABOUT ENGAGEMENTS.
The young men who come to the polls for the first
time in this election have before them the same
alternative as that which confronted the first voters
of 1896. It is a choice between the party of prosperity
and the party of calamity; the party that, preaches
harmony and the party that preaches antagonism. A
great majority of the first voters of 1806 allied them
selves with the Republican party and cast their
ballots for national honor and public prosperity. It
is hardly to be doubted that a similar choice will be
made by the young men of this year, and that the
strength of the party wilJ be renewed by the accession
of recruits who will take up its standards and its
principles and carry them forward to future victories
for the republic and for humanity.

judgment of the voter. It should embody the highest

best hopes and highest asph-ations as an individual
citizen, and always represent the greatest good to his
fellow-countrymen."

THE United States army transport
tug: Slocum arrived from New
York Saturday night after a fairly
good passage. The run was made
in 54 days 2 hours, actual steaming
time, which Is a good performance con
sidering the size of the vessel.
Owing to her limited coal capacity the
Slocum had to make numerous stops on
the v.-ay. She left New York July 12 and
coaled at St. Thomas on July 20. From
the island of St. Thomas she went to Per
rambuco. where more fuel was taken
aboard and the vessel was got under
way again on Aupust 2. Other stops were
made s.t Montevideo.* Sandy Point, Callao
and Acapulco. the latter port being left
on September 29.
The officers of the Slocum are Captain
K. J. Hampton, quartermaster; Captain
George Evelyn, navigating officer; Chief
Engineer Robert Jennlncs and Chief Offi
cer A. L. Olleridorf. Of these Captain
Hampton is perhaps the best known. He
is an old-time friend of Congressman Bar
ham of California, and during the Span
ish-American war was a correspondent in
Cuba for seme cf the New York dailies.
Chief Baslaeer Robert Jennings was
chief machinist on the plucky littie Glou
cester when that vessel dt-lkd the Spanish
r.avy and the puns of Morro Castle.
"We had a pood run nearly all the way
down ihe Atlantic coast." said Captain
Kvelyn yesterday. "At Montevideo we
were tied up for nearly a work on ac
count of a hurricane, but the first heavy
weather we had to contend with was In
the Straits of Magellan. It took us fifteen
days to make the iVi-mile run, and when
we were not steaming up to our anchor
we were holding our own against a head
wind. We did not get a plimpse of the
Indians or their everlasting Ore. It blew
too hard for the b*-st and biggest canoe
f-vtr iiuilt to live five minutes in the sea
that was running. At Callao we made a
short stop, and then we coaled again at
Acapulco. We came into port making
about sixteen knots <Vn hour."
The Slocum came out .with a patent
bronze wheel. Her towing wheel is made
fast on deck and will be put on as soon
as the vessel is drydocked. With her tow
ing wheel sh6 will not make more than
twelve knots, but then she will .tow the
largest transport in the Government ser
\iee at that speed, while she cannot make
bptter time unencumbered. At the present
time the Slocum is painted black, but as
soon as she has been on the drydock her
colors will' be changed and she will ap
pear as one of the white squadron. The
Slocum will handle all of the United
States army transport vessels in future
when they need moving about the bay
and have no steam in their boilers.

seemed to be the only things alive on the
boat and they flitted here and there with
no time to talk to any one. They were
very popular.
The groans seemed to have doubled in
volume until they disturbed the slumbers
of the captain, who came into the cabin
in time to hear the steward call out sud
denly as if at the beginning of a mass
meeting: "Is there a doctor on board?"
"Yes," came a faint chorus, and five heads
peered from as many doprs. "One of the
gentlemen wishes to see a doctor," con
tinued the steward. There was plenty of
medical talent on board, for the club
wished to keep a clean bill of health at
all costs, but none of it was available.
The live physicians held a consultation
and Dr. V. Wesley Carpenter of Wood
land solemnly announced the decision:
"If he needs a doctor any worse than we
do," he said, "let him come hero," and
then the five heads disappeared.
So thoroughly satisfied were the fisher
men with the ocean sunrise and the prom
ise of a beautiful day, that by consent
breakfast went over. A school of fish
made its presence known Just after and

and the ship cleared for fishing.

"Is the bar always as ur.steadv as

mate kindly. "It will be a bit better far

"You mean smoother?"
It was a gay party that started from
the Capital City Saturday evening. There
was a special car to be attached to the
overland for the club and all arrange
ments had been made in expectation of
a glorious outing, but the first hitch oc
curred when the overland rolled into the
depot on time. It was looked on as a
bad omen. liut the fishermen hail for

the city, and when they snuffed the bilge
water along the front they rolled In their
gait. che\ved tobacco and demanded to
be put aboard "the old tea kettle" at
ence.
It took but a few minutes to get the
club members aboard, but it took some
time longer to get their freight. They
had provided provisions enough for an
orphan asylum and drinkables enough to
float the ship should they get on a gand
spit, for they would not spoil the revelry
out in a thousand fathoms by getting
away with the pood things too soon, and
they had all been guarded In their indul
gences.
It was after 11 o'clock when the Point
Arena pushed her nose out through tha
Golden Gate ar.d bowed to the first long
swell that had come over from China.
Some of the fishermen had turned In;
others were in the main cabin and the
smoking rooms and other! were treading
the deck. One. who owns two rowboais
that ply on the river, was allowed to r-i
on the bridge and talk to the mate on
watch.
Saturday night so as to have a good
day's fishing yesterday at Cordell Ba'nks.
They came back last evening and with
out exercising stopover privileges head
ed straight for Sacramento, where they
went to bed. They chartered the Point
Arena, a coasting steamer. Her captain
says the trip was a great success. The
steward says it was easy. The cabin
boys declare they will strike before they
will work so hard again.

The fishermen on the trip were:
The bay seemed like a skating rink to
the homecomers. and by the time the
steamer was ready to dock most of them
were in a condition to say they wished
they could get seasick somehow and see
what it felt like. The others said noth
ing and all hunted the train. That at least
was not rolling:, and they reached Sacra
mento with lots to talk about, but with
more to. tell. A crop of resignations is
expected at the next meeting, with strict
er attention, to business and a conscien
tious scruple ag-ainst Sunday fishing urged
as the reason. The freight of the party
was left with the captain, and when he
expressed his gratitude the president of
the club put his finger significantly on
the captain's lips and said: "Don't men
tion it."
At noon the -steward put his best foot
foremost, and when everything was ready
he took a stalwart cabin boy oft other
duty and sent him around the deck with
the cor.g, but an appeal to the captain
stopped the noise, as unseemly and in
appropriate. The captain sat at the head
of the table while the fishermen made
the watch on deck. .
In the afternoon I the fishing lagged a
little more, and fears that the train would
be missed unless an early start was made
Â¦were voiced from every quarter, so the
Point Arena was headed homeward
through the swells. She dipped and
pranced as if to please her passengers,
but they thought of the broad Sacra
mento and compared it to the unreliable
character of old ocean, and hoped that
the club would lower the limit on deep
water hereafter so as to include the river
under the railroad bridge at home. There
was no necessity for 100 fathoms so long
as a person could drown in ten feet, it
was reasoned.
Prince, Albert and the Princess, sur
rounded by their suite, stood at the head
of the grand staircase and watched the
school children and the numerous societies
march by, each delegation throwing a
bourju-it at the feet of the Princess.
BRUSSELS. Oct. 7.â Prince Albert of
Belgium and his bride. Duchess Elizabeth
of Bavaria, were received at the town

thousands of Belgian and Bavarian flags,
while the onlookers generally cheered and
waved handkerchiefs. . The children then
sang a patriotic hymn, while the Prince

crowd was In attendance and enjoyed the
pleasant weather. Several clubs shot and
some good work was done at the targets.'
Members of the California
Club.
Eanges Were Well Occupied by the
launch McXelll to tow them to their
moorings. The tide being a very low one,
there was but little water in Tiburon
Cove, so that some of the larger boats
ran aground to await the rising of the
tide. Nearly all the yachts had large
parties on board and all passed a pleasant
day.

AXAMEDA WINS 3Y
NARROW MARGIN
The last match on the schedule of tho
California Cricket Association for the sra
eon of 1900 was played yesterday at Ala
meda between th*; Pacific and Alameda
teams, the latter winning in the first
Inning by th* narrow margin of three
runs. Thouph A. W. Wilding, going in
first, carried his bat through the Inning
for thirty-one runs, the rest of the Pa
cific team were able to complete only
thirteen runs, the total score beihg forty-
Fix. The Alamoda team did very little
better, six wickets falling for ten runÂ«,
and, had not Fortmann come to the res
cue with twonty-four. the score of the
blue and white would have fallen short
of the small Pacific total. As it was 'he
Alamedas managed to put together forty
nine runs. The Pacifies on their second
attempt scored thirty-five runs for six
wickets, H. Casidy and Bert Theobald he-
Ing not out when the Inning eloped In
the second Inning for Alameda H. Bird
scored SO, V. Seebrck 25 and F. Stahl 15
The score reached a total of 103 for nine
wickets. R. B. Hogue not going to bat and
G. J. Baugh bo-ing absent.
AI^ARGE fleet of Corinthian yachts
lay at anchor yesterday In Co

Going ashore, the yachtsmen about noon
began their annual game of baseball, #ne
team beirftj captained by "Keegan"

The "Keegans" were the following: D.
Dean. H. Johns. E. V. Sagar, E. Bowes,
J. V. O'Brien. J. H. Brlckell, L. Harris, R
R. l'Hommedieu, J. O"Brlen and F. E.

Brickwell, IT. W. Westerfeld. T. J.
Kavanaugh. W. C. Howe, J. Curtis, C. S.
Curtis, J. Short. Ed Smith and Haw
kins. Port Captain J. H. Keefe umpired
the game In a highly original and divert
ing manner, ultimately declaring the
Bcore to be all even with five runs for
each side.- After the game the players
gathered round the luncheon tables and
beer kegs, their exertions and the heat of
the day â¢ having supplied them with
mighty thirst and equal appetites.
In the morning there was a light breeze,

SAX FRANCISCO.
From a baseball standpoint the morning
game at Oakland was technically of the
champion order. In the first inning Dever
eaux made a two-bagger, advanced a base
on Krug's error, the only one of the game,
and scored on an out.
, At all lilies the playing was close, sci
entific and snappy. San Francisco found
Devereaux eight times, but luck was
.against thorn and they. failed to connect
with the plate on tho return. Fitzpatrick
pitched excellent ball, giving only four
hits to his opponents.
The score:
Sacramento 1, San Francisco 0.

run Â¦was made, that of Pabst's on Sulli
van's hit. Even Levy got a hit this inn-
Ing, but the symposium ended when Krug
flew to McLaughlln.
In the ninth Sacramento added a run,
Sheehan scoring on Reilly's erratic throw
ing to first. Then came the deluge of ex
citement, spasm the second. Doyle was re
sponsible for the first, Hughes for the sec
ond. With Levy and Krug ornamenting
first and second bases Reilly stepped to
the plate. Schwartz had already' scored on
a two-bagger, a passed ball and Sullivan's
out. Pabst had failed to connect with
three good ones. The score was 9 to 8 and
two men dead.
The setting sun poured its rays full In
the eyes of the batter, so Relay borrowed
a hat for a shade. But this would not
do. so he struck with one hand, using the
other as a protection *from the annoying
light. The players were as full of excite
ment ax the spectators. All sorts of ad
vice came from the men on the bench to
Reilly as he stood, one hand over his
eyes, the other grasping the bat. He hit
the ball to Eagan. who fumbled, and the
baes were crowded.
Would Knell save or win the gamp?
Like a streak the ball left his bat, travel
ing in Eagan's direction. All started
around the bags. It was Eagan's plav to
stave Reilly .off at second. He tried it,
but Reilly slid along the ground, beating
the ball hy an instant. Levy and Krug
had scored and the game was over:

GAMES FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CALIFORNIA BASEBALL LEAGUE, WHICH STILL REMAINS
WITH THE TEAM FROM THE CAPITAL CITY.
Wiih the Scoreboard denoting 8 to 2 In
favor of Sacramento. Kan Francisco came
to bat in the seventh inning. which
.Changed despair to happy hope. Krug
reached tho first station on one of Eagan's
errors and was sunning himself when
Itc-illy caught the spheroid just where the
spring lies. Between center and right,
clean to the fence, went the ball, while
Krug new around the bags. At third his
bag course was Interrupted by the stupid
coaching of Knell, and Broekhoff and the
German of .ill the Germans, died between
third and the nlato ami<1 the execrations
of the raving public. Then Knell took
to the willow and was justly placed In tho
morgue. After this the fireworks were set
off. Brockhoff hit safely. Relily scoring.

ball to loft field Brockhoff and Hilde.brand

rubber and Pabst stopped in his mad bag
career at the midway nolnt. One more
With the poignant memories of the
morning game. 1â0, in favor of the Sen
ators, the eighteen diamond cavorters
started to produce just such another ex
hibition. They fell short of it In the
third, when, the swatters from the Capi
tal City selected ripe fruit from Fireman
Fltz's basket and plastered It all over the
field. Sullivan, steady Jim. fell at this
juncture, prolonging the inning by drop
ping ine ball when t'nele Henry wanted
him to hold it most of all. Twice he
failed to tag men out at the plate after
the local fielders had made pretty throws.
If Sullivan was bad. '"Josh" Reilly was
several shades worse. The hall rKjored
out of Rtillys hands like water through
a sieve. Five times did he puncture the
baseball code of ethics, and with telling
force. Senator Eagan was the arch of
fender for Sacramento. He and Reilly
made a team.
Both San Francisco and Sacramento
used two pitchers. Fitzpatrlck started
for the locals and Doyle for the Senators.
After a hammering in the third and
fourth Innings, which meant no less than
seven runs for the visitors. Harris lis
tened to th'e crowd and changed "box
men," Knell stepping upon the Blab.
Fireman Fitz twirled in the morning
game at Oakland, and so admirably did
he do hi? work that Harris tried him
again in the afternoon. Doyle was In fine
fettle until the seventh, â¢when he too was
treated to the mace. The boy at tho score
board changed the figure against San
Francisco at the end of this inning front
2 to 7. Sacramento read 8. Then Hughes
was called in from right field and set to
swinging his arm In the pitcher's box.
"It's all over now." yelled a Sacramento
fan. But hereckoned in advance, and the
ninth found Hughes as vulnerable as
Achilles' heel.
Even the old "halcyon days" gave
nothing of baseball rapture comparable
with that of yesterday. Two occasions
offered opportunities for fanatic delirium
âthe seventh inning when the local team
pulled itself out of a slough of seemingly
irreparable defeat and the ninth when It
clinched the victory in a manner equally
as sensational. Errors and hits generated
runs yesterday afternoon. Both teams
won and lost the game several distinct
times. This it was that made the game
Â£o intensely exciting and carried the
crowd right off its feet.
UNDER the microscope the cul
minating baseball game of the
series between San Â¦ Francisco
and Sacramento, played yester
day afternoon on the Recreation
grounds, presents many flaws. But such
was its nature that not one of the SOOQ
people that packed the place like two sar
dines for every one In a box had a
thought of the technical value of the
game.
All was unbridled, crackling, explosive
enthusiasm. The ninth Inning was neces
sary to make the local team the winner,
and while victory was In process the ulu
lating crowd, rhaklng with the fever of
excitement, rose as one person, forgetting
that there was such a thing as a seat In
the grand stand or the bleachers. In the
boxes chairs were used to wave and beat
a material demonstration to the surging
emotions within the breasts of the
fanatics. Hats were used for any other
purpose than head covering and many a
shoulder is sore to-day from the beating
administered by the man in the row back.
Big Excitement

a close score, ran a bye In the third and
In the fifth beat out Rollicking' Airs by a
single point, almost Immediately after
that dop had been run to a standstill

her a candidate for the deciding course
with Golden Russet. Fortune favored her
once more. Russet was forced out of the*
frame on account of hard running, and
Honesty won the stake by default.
Golden Russet would have been an easy
winner If chances had been even.
Throughout the stake she showed great
speed and cleverness. In the fifth and
sixth rounds she won out on the short
end. beatinjr Master Claire and the stake
favorite, both courses at 5 to 3.
Bohe ran in great form. Not a point
was scored nsralnst her In the second,
third and fourth rounds. In the fifth sha
beat Royal Union by a score of ->7 to 4.
Then came a hard go between the fast
black one and Golden Russet. Bohe led
three lengths from the slips and after a
.short work stumbled. Russet evened mat
ters by getting a fall, and then outworked
her opponent. In the hardest kind of go-
Ing Bohe was forced to quit. The score
was IS to 10.

Superintendent of Elections "Warns
New York's Chief of Police.
NEW YORK. Oct. 7.â John McCullach.
State Superintendent of Elections for the
metropolitan district, to-day sent out let
ters to the authorities of this city touch-
Ing on the coming elections. In a letter
to Chief of Police Devery. Mr. McCullach
calls attention to the dates of registra
tion and says: -
The past experience of this department dem
onstrates very clearly that the sources of the
dpbauchment of the franchise In the city of
Xew York are chiefly found in the poolrooms,
gambling houses, disorderly houses, saloons
run under the guise of hotels In order to evade
the provisions of the excise law and dives of
evr.n baser sort. ;-â¢:â¢ 'Â¦ r
Mr. McCullach details the successful
prosecution of illegal voters and their
s-ponsors after the elections of November,
18?D, ar.d calls attention to the fact that
the evidence in these cases showed that
they were engineered by persons having
official connection with the city govern
ment, and that the Illegal voters were
drawn from the sources quoted In the ab
stract of the letter here given. He says
that he has .lately caused the Investiga
tion of such resorts in the city of New
York and has In his possession sworn af
fidavits violations of almost
every provision of law nnd ordinances re
lating to such places. From the evidence
that has come Into his possession he is
convinced that an organized attempt Is
being made to colonize Illegal voters for
the next general election in and from
these places. *
Sir. McCullach submits tHte addresses of
over 200 saloons or other resorts alleged
to, be of the character mentioned, and
says that If prompt action be not taken
by Chief Devery In suppressing these re
sorts he will Invoke the aid or the State
authorities. His -letter closes with a de
mand that the Chief and members of his
command shall give to the Superintendent
Of Elections all the aid In his power.

It is proposed to revive it.
This Pleasanton training track has de
veloped more great harness horses than
almost ony other place of the kind in the
United States. It was here that the fa
mous Direct stock was raised and trained,
and where Direct, Director and Directuin
made some of their great records. Ana
conda and Flying Jib, Searchlight and
Rey Direct all came from Pleasanton and
were brought to perfection Upon the old
Pleasanton track.
PLEASANTOX. Oct. 7.â H. F. Ander
son, the owner of the old Pleasanton
training track, is 'going to make some
important improvements in this famous
course. Mr. Anderson has put a gang of
men at work regrrading, widening and Im

become one of the best training tracks on
the coast. Stalls and stables are being
orected. and Mr. Anderson proposes to re
vive the industry of training and develop

OAKLAND. Oct. 7.â The wedding
of Alfred E. NicolletU and Miss
Hildegarde Neumann took place
this afternoon at the residence
of the bride. 1357 Sixteenth Btreet.
After a wedding supper this evening thÂ«
couple left for Del Monte, where they will
spend their honeymoon. The ceremony
was performed by Rev. J. H. Theiss, pas
tor of the German Lutheran Church. The
original arrangements provided for a
wedding under the auspices of the Roman
Catholic Church, but at the last moment
the arrangements were changed and the
ceremony was performed by the pastor of
the Lutheran Church. Â¦ Â¦Â»
The wedding was a very pretty home
affair. The house decorations were in
pink and white. During the ceremony the
young couple stood beneath a large wed
ding be!l of pink and white carnations.
The bride s gown was of heavy while
satin. The veil was of tulle and she car
ried a bouquet of bride's roses. The maul
of honor. Miss Wanda Mesow. and the
bridesmaid. Miss Bertha Schultz. wore
white organdie gowns. The ring-bearers
were little Gladys and Jocelyn Neumatu,
nieces of the bride. \
Reginald Goodcell attended the groom
and the ushers WÂ£re Dr. Montoux and
Charles Beck.
Alfred E. Nicolletti Is an artist of con
siderable note locally. While of Italian
parentage his family has resided in this
country for three generations and all
have been sculptors. It was In the studio
of Mr. Nicolletti"s preat-grandfather in
Boston that the first American piece of
plaster statuary was made. The bride is
a very popular and talented artist and
musician.

merits of the examination approves the eligi

union pavers, thus aiming a blow at union
labor, and furthermore, to show the Impracti
cability of the examination a cripple from the
Almshouse got a rating of 97 per cent.
Long vigorously denied the assertions
made by Barnett in his letter of criticism
and declared him a falsifier.

a morning paper for petitioning the Civil

Timothy Long introduced the following
resolution, which was adopted:
"Whereas, As F. P. Barnett. president

Daniel Maloney, aeronaut, had a miracu
lous escape from death at a balloon ascen
sion at Oakland Park this afternoon. He
cut away the parachute, which did not
open, and the fact that he fell Into the
top of a large tree is the only thing that
saved his life. As it was he dropped from
the tree to the ground, a distance of
forty feet, and injured his back, though
not seriously.
Maloney was making an ascent to-day
and attempted some unusual acrobatic
feats. He did some trapeze work during
the ascent, and when he reached the
point at which he was expected to cut
away the parachute he found uhat th3
rigging had become tangled in some man
ner-so that he was unable to cut affiy.
and It became necessary to ride the oa.
loon nearly back to the earth.
The aeronauts who make the ascent, at
Oakland Park agree with the manage
ment that they will not claim their moiiey
unless they cut away the parachute and
make a drop. Maloney wanted to earn
his money and workPd upon the balloon
until he got his ropes loose and cut the
rigging that held to the balloon. By this
time the balloon had pot within 300 fe*>t
of the earth and the drop was too short
to enable the parachute to open properly
and check the fall of the aeronaut .o
the earth. Maloney would have been
dashed to pieces by his rapid fall had
it not been that he fell, happily, into the
top of the tree, xhis broke his fall, ond
he escaped with a sprained back, caused
by the fall from the tree to the ground.

"Emma" when ore of the thieves deftly
removed his wallet, containing JIOO. from
his trousers pocket.
Before the dance was concluded the
doctor missed his money, and abruptly
leaving his partner in the waltz he re

hour yesterday morning and were the
direct results of Nyhan's lack of discrim

At midnight Saturday Nyhan told his
wife he was going out to get something to

which he told her to put away, and then
took his departure.
At 3 o'clock yesterday morning Xyhan
returned. Vut not alone. He wax accom
panied by three men with whom he was
apparently on the best of terms. As soon
as they were inside the store, however,
one of the men grabbed a whisky bottle
and hit Nyhan on the head, knocking him
to the floor unconscious. The other two
men then approached Mrs. Nyhan and
demanded the bag of money. As they
were evidently not inclined to trWe she
produced the money and they quickly dis
appeared.
The robbers were scnrcely out of s'^ht
before Mrs. Nyhan was vigorously toot
ing a police whistle.
Policeman K. \V- Esken and several civ

time Nyhan had recovered his senses and
brusquely informed the bluecoat that his
services were not required, that he could
attend to his own affairs.
After a few hours, however, Nyhan
changed his mind about needing the as
sistance of the police. He pointed out
\\illtam Coleman to Policeman J. Dono

was arrested on Clementina street.

to the Morgue and the body was removed

Thq man had nothing in his pockets by
which he could be identified. He was
about 50 years of age, with mustache and
chin whiskers streaked with gray. He
wore a dark overcoat, almost new; a dark
suit of clothes, gaiter shoes,, black neck
tic and standing collar.
The stranger also had a gold watch and
chain and a gold ring with the letter "H"
engraved on it, which may possibly lead
to his identification.
It Is supposed that the man may have
been subject to apoplexy and by drinking
the cold soda water when he was in a
heated condition a fatal attack. may have
been brought on.. An autopsy will be
made to ascertain the cause of death.

From Port Townsend Mrs. Woodman
went almost immediately to Seattle and
registered at the National Hotel as Mrs.
L. C. Brown. The stolen bank book was
presented at the First National Bank
there by Joseph Gates, who is vouched
for as a prominent business man of Port
Townsend, Mrs. Woodman claims that
he is an old friend of her family, and
admits that she imposed upon him in re
gard to the bank book. A telegram from
the Seattle bank to the Hibernla Bank
enabled the detectives to trace Mrs.
Woodman, but she in the meantime had
left for San Francisco, and it was upon
her arrival here Friday night that she
was arrested. She says that ehe tore the
bank book up and threw tho pieces Into
Puget Sound.
Mrs. Woodman Is a woman apparfntly
3.1 years of age and not unprepossessing.
She says she must have been temporarily
insane when she stole the box, and that
she did not realize the enormity of her
crime until Mr. Gates reported that the
banks would not transfer the deposit.
She asserts that insanity is prevalent in
her family and tuat an aunt and six
cousins are now insane. She says that
she Is a midwife and that her husband
died six years ago. From a diploma from
a Boston hospital found in her trunk De
tective Hammill learned that her maiden
name was Abbie Parrett.
The. son. W. J. Stone, returned from
Nome some ten days ago, and when the
theft was discovered, a week ago to-day,
he was active in helping the detectives
ferret out the thief.
Another bank book, showing Mrs.
Stone's personal deposit of $600 at the HI
bernia Bank, was also missing, but it was
found yesterday under a trunk in Mrs.
Stone's room. The owner Is certain that
she never put it there.
Mrs. Stone hiid been living alone in her
rooms at the Page-street residence, her
husband. Dr. J. C* Stone, being at Nome
engaged in mining, he having gone there
with a son. W. J. Stone. Another son,
Dr, M. V. Stone, TJ. S. N., is on the U. S.
S. Yosemite, now at Guam. It was his
bank deposit that Mrs. Woodman tried to
have transferred to the Port Townsend
bank. Dr. Stone had left a blank check
payable to his mother or bearer in the
book, and that probably suggested to
Mrs. Woodman the possibility of securing
the entire amount.
lawyer in regard' to the fortune left to
her. According to the woman's confes
sion she had stolen the tin box and its
contents four days earlier.
Mrs. Woodman's sudden departure for
Port Townsend occurred a week ago Sat
urday. She represented to Miss de Cour
sey that she was going there to see a
Miss de Coursey says that she now be
lieves that Mrs. Woodman was not a de
liberate criminal, but that she stole the
valuables in the tin box under the im
pulse of the moment and with the desire
to repay to her the money that she had
advanced from time to time in view of
Mrs. Woodman's alleged Inherited wealth.
Miss de Coursey was taken to the City
Prison Saturday afternoon to see Mrs.
Woodman, and shortly afterward the lat
ter sent for Detective Hammill and made
her confession.
Miss de Coursey is much disturbed over
her former companion's crime. She
claims that she was duped by her; that as
a nurse Mrs. Woodman wormed herself
Into her good graces and had made her
believe that a fortune of $600,000 and a
fish cannery Jn Massachusetts had been
left to her. She fed the morbid imagina
tion of the sick woman on promises of
what she would do for her when she had
come into her money.
Mrs. Woodman spoke several times of
a passion for diamonds, and once when
Mrs. Stone was in her room she suddenly
arose and tried her trunk to see if it
were locked. She said she kept her dia
monds in it and was afraid they would
be stolen. Mrs. Stone, in her trustfulnes*
in the honesty of the womarfC remarked
that she kept her jewelry In a tin box In
a closet of her bedroom for safety. The
following day Miss de Coursey said to
Mrs. Stone. "Oh, I wish you could see
Mrs. Woodman's diamonds. She has a
beautiful collection of unset stones. She
keeps them in a safe deposit vault In
Boston."
In the course of their six weeks' stay at
1934 Page street, many things occurreu
that are now looked back upon with sus
picion by those who live there. While the
strangers had money at first in plent>, it
began to be exhausted in a way that did
not tally with their tale of wealth. Then
occasionally they would â¢ be observed
holding conversations in the deaf and
dumb alphabet, and when they saw they
were observed they would stop in con
fusion.
Miss de Coursey, suffering from a throat
affection, had lost her power of speech,
but had partially recovered it in Southern
California. The young woman was evi
dently in poor health and no one ques
tioned their story.
Mrs. Woodman came to San Francisco
about two months ago with Miss Maude
de Coursey. After stopping at a hotel for
a few days, they took rooms in the house
where Mrs. Dr. Stone resides. They rep
resented that they were both from Boston
and that Miss de Coursey was wealthy
and had come to California on account of
ill-health. Mrs. Woodman was traveling
with her as a nurse. They had gone first
to San Diego and then to Los Angelco.
At first denying her guilt, the woman
finally confessed Saturday evening, and
without loss of time she was taken,
though night had fallen, to the park and
after searching for a while with tragical
intensity she came upon the mound that
marked the cache of the stolen property.
Tearing excitedly at the loose earth with
her fingers, she brought the treasures to
light and turned them jver to Detective
Hammlll. the officer who accompanied
her, with every elgn of relief from her
mental strain.
Mrs. Woodman has confessed to having
stolen a tWi box containing shares valued
at $3500. a bank book^showlng $2160 on
deposit at the Hibernla Bank. Jewelry
valued at $300, and several gold nugget*,
all the property of Mrs. Dr. J. C. Stone
of 1534 Page street. Having gouged the
stones of the jewelry from their settings,
in preparation for disposing of them more
easily when opportunity should offer, the
woman took her ill-gotten wealth stealth
ily into Golden Gate Park, an entrance to
which is but half a block away, and
burled all of it excepting the bank book
near Superintendent McLaren's lodge.
Then she fled to Port Townsend and from
there went to Seattle. Falling In an cZ
fort to draw on the Hibernla Bank ac
count through the First National Bank
of Seattle, she left the sound cities and
came back to San Francisco, to be met
by officers and placed und.er arrest.

tery envelops her history and- character
and it remains to be discovered whether
she is a hardened criminal or a foolisn
woman who committed theft under stresa
of strong temptation.

Spontaneous Combustion Causes Blaze
on Fourth Floor of a Parrott
Estate Building at Davis
and Sacramento.
Quick work on the part of the fire de
partment saved the commercial district
from a dangerous conflagration last
evening. A tire in the large aix-story
building, owned by the Parrott estate, at
the corner of Sacramento and Davis
streets, was extinguished after a hard
ngrnt. The total loss will amount to about
SlO.OuO. Spontaneous combustion on the
fourth floor, occupied as a storeroom by
Ames & Harris, manufacturers of tents,
bags and awnings, is the supposed cause
of the tire.
Shortly nfter S o'cIock Sergeant Cook of
the Harbor Police Station observed
smoke issuing from the upper stories of
the structure. Policeman Gvrfn at once
turned in an alarm from an auxiliary box
at the corner of Druram and Calitornia
streets. Before tho tire department ar
rived tije flames had gained considerable
headway and It seemed as if a serious
conflagration was imminent. A second
alarm was at once sounded and brought
an additional relay of engines to the
scene.
The front portion of the floor, occupied
by Ames & Harris as a storeroom, was
ablaze find smoke and flames were pour
ing out of the windows.
After many minutes the flames seemed
to be subdued, but later broke out in an
other part of" the building. In less than
an hour, however, the last spark had been
extinguished.
The loss to the building will be about
$5000. Ames & Harris will suffer to the
extent of about $3000 and the losses of
others by water and smoke will bring the
total up to $10,000. Fred H. Busby and
Russ,' Early & Harville were occupants of
the building.
Fire Marshal Towe found the fire
started in the middle of a floor on which
was piled much excelsior and flexible
wire. He arrived at the conclusion that
spontaneous combustion was the cause.
