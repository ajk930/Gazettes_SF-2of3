spondents of Japanese newspapers
say that the story of the British hav

the British were first at the legations.
The town of Tungchou, says the corre

Is In ruins. Out of a population of 75,000

there blew up and. forty-seven British and
German soldiers lost their lives.
The foreign troops wintering in Peking
and Tientsin will require a free harbor

seems to afford the best facilities. There
is a railway from Shanhaikwan to Tong

CALL BUREAU, WELLINGTON HO
TEL, WASHINGTON, Oct. lO.-Sec
retary Hay sent this evening to
the French Charge d' Affaires the formal
answer of the United States to the pro
posals of France and Russia relative to
the basis of negotiations for the settle
ment of the Chinese question. In this
communication the Secretary makes it
plain that the United States earnestly de
sires that negotiations be opened with all
expedition, believing that only such action
can urevent outbreaks Inimical to for
eigners in Southern China, Three of the
French proposals are not acceded to, but
it is stated by officials ' that this failure
to assent to them does not necessarily
mean that the whole proposition will fall.
As a matter of fact this Government
cordially approves those proposals rela
tive to the punishment of tho responsible
authors of tho outrages and payment of
sufficient Indemnity, by the Chinese Gov
ernment. Without the consent of' Con
gress the President could not agree to the
proposal contemplating the interdiction of
the importation of arms or the establish
ment of garrisons in a foreign country.
It Is deemed essential' fnat China should
be In a position to defend, herself.- and,
therefore, this Government cannot con
sent to Join with other nations In razing
the forts at Taku. ;
Deep satisfaction is expressed in 'official
circles at the punishment- the Chinese
Government Is reported- to have inflicted
upon Prince Tuan. who is banished to the
imperial post roads on the Siberian fron
tier; YIng Nien, president^ of censorate;
Yang Yl, assistant grand secretary i and
president of the civil board, and Chao Shu
Chla, president of the board of punish
ment, to be beheaded, and Princes
Chwang and Yih and Duke Tsal Lan, who
will bo Imprisoned for life. It is known
that some of. the powers of Europe, not
ably Germany, will be disposed -to Â¦ insist
upon the decapitation of Prince Tuan.
Officials of the administration assert,
however, that, tho banishment of Prince
Tuan is in itself a heavy punishment, and
that many Chinamen have committed sui
cide rather than be taken to the Siberian
frontier. Conditions in Southern China
are not at all good, there being unrest.
Unsupported by the Chinese Government,
tho Viceroys have maintained peace and
order, but the people are disposed to Join
in the anti-foreign movement, and unless
the powers take some action such as the
opening of peace negotiations' which justi
fy the attitude of the Viceroys, it is dif
ficult to say what may happen.

Otsego, the next stop, was down for
only a three-minute speech, but Mr.
Bryan extended the time to about ten
minutes. The trust question had been
considerably agitated at this point and
Mr. Bryan plunged into It at the very
beginning. At this point Mr. Bryan was
presented with a fine silk hat to take
the place of the hat he wa3 reported to
have lost In North Dakota.
Allegan extended a very, hospitable wel

"Of all the pathetic pages of history
none is sadder than the page which is
being enacted to-day down in South
Africa. A people who came from a race
that has for centuries lived in peace, a
liberty-loving people, are struggling for
the rights that our forefathers fought for,
and grandfather, father and son are d>
lng together in the trenches, and tho wo
men take up the guns and fight when the
men are dead, and yet the Republican
party is so busy trying to figure tho
profits of syndicates in the Philippines
that it has no time to be sorry for the
Boers. My friends, when did a party ever
fall from such a high estate in so short
a time?"
At Kalamazoo, where there are many
Hollanders, Mr. Bryan expressed his
warm sympathy with the Boers, saying:
The crowds were all complimentary In
size as well as In tho attention given, but
those of the day were neither bo large
nor so enthusiastic as Mr. Bryan's'meet
lngs in Indiana and Illinois. The night
meetings at Muskegon and Grand Rapids
were both, however, numerously attend

of applause as well as words of approval.
These meetings were equal to the best
of the entire tour.
The towns In which the speeches were
made were: Michigan City. New Buffalo,
Benton Harbor, Niles. Dowagiac, Lawton,
Kalamazoo, Plainneld, Otsego, Allegan,
Hamilton, Holland, Grand Haven, Mus

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., Oct. 10.â The

of the meetings were held in the open air.
The tour was under the management of
State Chairman Campau, and was admir
Â«Ubly conducted- The train was at no time
more than ten minutes behind time, and
all of the speaking platforms were erected
so near the railroad stations that in only
one instance was it necessary for Mr.

the scarcely less famous peach country,
as well as several furniture manufacturing

PARADE OF STRIKING MINERS.
jr w AZLETOX, Pa,. Oct. 10.â A spe-
Esmjj cial policeman was instantly
1 I killed, another was wounded in
J the head, a striker was probably
fatally shot and ten non-union
men were more or less seriously wounded
at the Oneida colliery of Coxe Bros, in a
clash between the officers and 500 strikers
this morning. The victims are:
Killed:
RALPH MILLS, aged 50 years, of
Beaver Meadows, one of the officers con
veyed in a special train early this morn
ing from that place to Oneida. He was
shot through the back.
â¢-George Kellnor, aged 3S, of Â¦ Beaver
Meadow, also a special officer. He re
ceived shot wounds in the head, but will
recover.
Joseph Lekow, aged 3S, of Sheppton, a
striker. Was shot in the groin and will
probably die.
Ten non-union men were stoned, but
only two of them were seriously injured.
They are John Van Blargin and James
Tosh of Sheppton. The former sustained
scalp wounds and the latter had four ribs
broken.
The Oneida colliery had been in opera
tion since the inauguration of the strike.
The union men at Sheppton, where many
of the employes of the Oneida and Der
ringer of Coxe Brothers & Co. live, de
cided early this morning to close the
mine. They gathered in groups on the
streets as early as 3 o'clock. As the non
union men went to work they were asked
by the strikers to remain at. home. Some
turned back; others did not. Those who
went to the colliery were stoned.
Van Blargin, one of the non-union em
ployes, attempted to draw a revolver, but
the weapon was taken from him and In
the beating he received he had several
ribs broken. This occurred just before
starting time at the mine. ;/"-;* ?>_;
The strikers remained at the colliery
all". morning. As the small mine loco
mottve used in hauling the coal from No.
2 and No. 3 collieries to the Oneida
breaker pulled up on the* road near the
latter colliery a crowd of women blocked
the track. The women were told by Gen
eral Superintendent Cudlick to go home.
He assured them that their husbands
would get an increase, in wages and that
their other grievances ] would be properly
adjusted. The women refused to listen
and" stoned the superintendent, who was
wounded in the head.
Then the striking men and women
rushed toward the colliery.** A force of
about Hfty special policemen who had
been brought down from' Beaver Meadow
to prevent trouble attempted to intercept
the mob, but they were powerless to do
anything and retired to the engine-house.
Just as the officers got close to shelter
a shot was fired. This was followed by
another, and in a few seconds many shots
rang through the air. Policeman Mills
was the first to fall. Then Joseph Lekow,
a striker, staggered to the ground. No
one knows who shot first, but It Is be
lieved both the strikers and the officers
used their weapons. A gunshot killed
Mills and small shot struck Policeman
Kelnor. Lekow, the striker, was struck
by a ball from a revolver, with which all
the officers were armed. After the shoot
ing the strikers dispersed.
Sheriff Toole of Schuylklll County, In
whose district the trouble occurred, was
in Philadelphia and could tender no as
sistance. His chief deputy, James O'Don
nell, arrived here this afternoon and went
to the scene with a force of men.
Carl - Houser, a Lithuanian minister
from Freeland v who baptized a child at
Oneida just at the time the shooting was
in progress, was mistaken by the strikers
for Superintendent Kudllck and narrowly
escaped being stoned. He was soon recog
nized by a friend and escorted safely to
the station.

FORT WAYNE, lr.d.. Oct. 10.â Governor
Roosevelt closed a busy day's work b>
rnukir.pr three speeches In this city to
night, addressing the greater number of
j.Â»rsorife in the aggregate who have ever
trathÂ«-red in Fort Wayne to listen to a
can.liuate for Vice Presidential honors.
lie was honored also with three large pa
ra ties.
The last stop prior to arriving here was
at Huntir.gton. where an imposing illum
inated parade was given. Reaching For;
Wayne the Governor was driven imme-.
diarely to the Kink, where ie- wÂ«a greeted
with prolonged applause. Having deliv
ered his address he was escorted to a
largf tent especially erected for the oc â¢
casion, Â¦where he made a second speech,
and thence he went to Liberty Hai;,
wh^re he spoke for the third time.
When the Roosevelt party reached the
Ilink tl!Â«r- structure was crowded and hun
dreds of persons were unable to obtain
admission. When the Governor was In
troduced the auJR-nce rose as one man
and gave him three cheers and a tiger.
Tho Governor*! address was a reply to a
E;;c-ech recently made at Macomb. 111., by
Sir. IJrya.il. Governor Roosevelt said:
"I notice that Mr. Bryan's own organ
in Ir.diana. the Indianapolis Sentinel, re
ports him as having said last night at
Macomb, Jll.. that "the real object for
jwrrtaneritly increasing the army is to in
timidate the labor clement whe-n It pre
sents just complaints. The idea is to erect
forts near the large cities and with the
forces located in them meet all the de
mands of labor.'
"I earnestly hope that the Sentinel has
misquoted Mr. Bryan. 1 am not willing
to believe that any responsible party lead
er, and least of all the candidate of any
euch party for the Presidency, would per
mit himself to make sucli statements.
There Is not one shadow <>f excuse foÂ»
them. It is difficult to 'speak temperately
of what is in effect simply an appeal to
the basest an<l most evil passions of man
kind by deliberate misrepresentation ot
the intention and action of patriotic and
law-abiding citizens.
"Mr. Bryan either does know or ought,
to know not only that the statements
quoted above are untrue, but there is not
one shadow of Justification for them. The
Increased array has been made necessary
l>y the war In the Philippines, to which
his own utterances and those of his party
associates have continuously added fuel.
"I am willing to guarantee that not one
human being concerned In the increase of
the army ever for a moment considered
such a purpose as that attributed to them
by Mr. Bryan. There was no idea of
erecting fortifications near the large cities
and never has been, save where they are
to be used for defense against a foreign
fee There is no fort near Indianapolis,
for instance, because it cannot be menaced
by a foreign foe. There are forts near
New York, because Â»e can be menaced,
but these forts are garrisoned by heavy
artillery regiments, and surely Mr. Bryan
r.iust know that heavy artillery can only
be used in defense of fortlilcatlons, e?pe
t:\.i.lly against hostile ships of war or bat
u ries. If Mr. Bryan will take the trouble
to I'.nd out the facts he will discover that
in any large city the police force Is rela
tively to the population from two to four
times the sizo of the regular army -rela
livcly to the population of the UnUcd
States. Mr. Bryan must know perfectly
well that the army would be reduced If
the insurrection In the Philippines, to
which he and his party associates have
given aid and comfort, were put down
and the Islands became definitely quiet.
He either knows or ought to know that
our standing army, relatively to the size
of the population, is nearly one-half less
than it was in Thomas Jefferson's time,
end that there Is no more ; thought of
lining it to coerce the labor element, or
any other clement, than there was
thought of so using It in the days of Jef

view through the crowded streets of this
city to-day and showed their loyalty to
the cause for which they have been bat
tling for the past three weeks. Not only
did the strikers manifest loyalty to their
principles, but they showed the confi
dence they had in their leader. John
Mitchell, who came here to participate In
the parade and to address the men In
mass-meeting. The national presidents
welcome was an exceedingly flattering
one. It was the greatest labor demonstra
tion that has ever taken place in the
Lackawanna Valley. Thousands of min
ers and their families came to the city
from all towns Â¦within a radius of twenty
miles. The city was ccnerously bedecked
with the national colors and most of tho
business places were closed in honor ct
the occasion.
The demonstrations began with the ar
rival of President Mitchell from Sharno
kln shortly before 2 o'clock. He wu met
at the* station by a local reception com
mittee and a crowd of several thousand
persons. Owing to President Mitchell'"'
late arrival the parade was not started
until 2:30 o'clock. The strike leader, with
James Moir, Mayor of Scranton. rode in
a carriage at the head of the line. Then
came a solid column of workingmen Â»o
long that It took an hour and fifteen min
utes to pass a given point. As in th'e other
big parades held in the region during the
past ten days many of the boys employed
in tha breakers preparing coal for tha
markets were in line. There were aiso
Innumerable banners carried by the men
bearing mottoes and other* inscriptions,
setting forth their grievances. The parade
was dismissed at the circus grounds on
the outskirts of the city, where the big
mass-meeting was held.
It was estimated that more than 10.000
persons were gathered around the speak
ers* stand. Fred Dllcher of Ohio, mem
ber of the executive board of the United
Mine-workers, who acied as presiding of
ficer, introduced President Mitchell.
When M>. Mitchell in his speech told
the miners that the proposition of the op
erators to advance wages 10 per cent was
not enough the spontanlety of the cheer
ing was surprising and almost startling.
He followed this up toy declaring that tho
mine officers ought to abolish the com
pany stores and the sliding scale and that
they should pay the men their wages
semi-monthly, as the Pennsylvania laws
direct. "With the mention of each griev
ance there was an' outburst of applause
from the men.
Mr. Mitchell refuted the charges tha.t
the strike was inaugurated in the inter
est of politicians and also denied that
bituminous interests had anything to do
with the present content. He declared that
If any soft coal was shipped Into the an
thracite district as a substitute it was;
coming from the non-union fields of Vir
ginia. He gave the non-union men now
on strike in the anthacite field great cred
it for suspending work along with the
union workers. He t>ald there were only
SO.000 union men in the anthracite region
on the day when the anthracite strike be
gan, but 112,000 men have obeyed the or
der to strike. The other speakers Includ
ed Mayor Moir. who welcomed Mr. Mitch
ell; George Purcell of Indiana and XT, B.
Falrley of Alabama, members of the na
tional executive board.
Pond Creek Men Strike.
HAZLETON, Pa.. Oct. 13.â The men em
ployed at the Pond Creek colliery operated
by the Pond Creek Coal Company went
en strike this afternoon and submitter!
a list of grievances. This is the colliery
which the mine workers did not attempt
to close down because of the promiaj
made by the superintendent a week ago
when the strikers marched to Pond Creek
that no coal would be shipped to market
while the strike is on. This promise was
kept by the company, but the men. f\ ap
pears, took matters into their own hands.
CECIL, RHODES IS
TENDERED AN OVATION
Says That Now the War Is Over Dis
putes as to Its Origin Should
Cease.
CAPE TOWN. Oct. 10.â Cecil Rhodes rc
cel\-ed an ovation to-day when ho. as
sumed the presidency of the Congress of
the South African League. During the
course of his address he attributed t>e
South African war to the "mugwumps,"
and said that but for them Mr. Krugcr
would never have dared to send an ulti
matum to Great Britain.
Generally speaking Mr. Rhodes was con
ciliatory In his remarks. He declared that
now that "Krugerlsm had vanished"
Great Britain would establish a liberal
government, "which would do everything
possible to unite the Interests of South
Africa with those of the empire."
Mr. Rhodes also said there was no de
sire to plaster Rhodesia on Cape Colony,
Intimating that It was likelier to be the
other way, but he thought Rhodesia
would be one of the Federal States, with
great opportunities for expansion in the
direction of the Congo.
He then said: "Xow that the battle is
over, the disputes on the origin of the war
ought to cease. The race question must
be subordinated. The league should sup
port three pointsâ the supremacy of the
flag, equal rights and show the Dutch
that there Is no feeling against them.
Having won what It Is entitled to. the
league ought to demonstrate that the In
terests of the races are the same. Then
there will be great hope for the country."

BESTKAINED FAOM SELLING
STOCK QUOTATIONS
Temporary Injunction Granted by
Judge Kohlsaat in the United
' States Circuit Court. -
CHICAGO, Oct. 30.â A temporary injunc
tion has been issued by Judge Kohlsaat
In the United States Circuit Court prohib
iting Oscar M. Stone and others from ob
taining, selling or distributing the quota
tions of the Chicago Board of Trade* The
complainant was the Cleveland Telegraph
Company, which has ' the right under its
contract with the board to â¢ disseminate
the quotations. Judge Kohlsaat held:
Firstâ That there exists In the Board of
Trade a right of property In the quota
tions until they are made over to the
public.
â¢ Secondâ That there; is no such dedica
tion to public use as will serve to defeat
or terminate the property right. Â¦.;-.Â¦
Thirdâ That lMwas within the power of
the board to convey to the complainant
the 'property, right, and that this com
plainant acquired good title by . its con-'
tract.' ;* 'â¢ â¢ *> Â¦
Granting that the: right to the quota
tions is a property right the court said
It cannot be denied that the 1 complainant
was greatly â¢ damaged by the broadcast
scattering of the quotations by purloiners
who, by reason of having to pay noth-,
ing for them,' could! obviously render the
complainant's 1 right; of -property valueless. 1

After passing thirty years of her life on
her father's farm near Bayport. L. I., she
came to New York about three years ago.
She was Emma Smith, daughter of a

WASHINGTON, Oct. lO.-Mr. Bryan has
been appealed to by Nebraska Democrats
to cut short his Eastern trip and to go
home to prevent the Republicans from

himself Is to go Into the State with Sen
ator V rye of Maine, and other prominent
Republicans, who will be in the State
while Bryan is invading the enemy's coun

and Sneaker Henderson.
Republican leaders plan to keep men ,of
national .- repute in the State .from now
until the day of election.- There will not
be a town of importance! in which the Re
publicans will not be heard, and when the
day of election comes extraordinary
means are to be taken to get out the Re
publican vote. Mr. Hanna is economiz
ing in his campaign expenditures bo as
to have plenty, of money to devote : to
getting men to the polls on election, day
in States like Nebraska where the result
is so doubtful that every vote counts. In
country districts Republican managers
will have carriages at their command
throughout the day and. every man who
can be depended upon to vote the Repub

a ride to the voting place at the expense

PARIS, Oct. 10.â According to La Prebse
the French Government is being consulted
on the subject of President Kruger land-
Ing at Marseilles and passing through
Paris on his way to Holland.
"The eventuality of the Boer President's
visit to France has," adds this journal,
"aroused great opposition on the part of
M. Delcasse. We all remember the en
thusiastic welcome given the three Boer
delegates. -What would it be if the old
hero of Pretoria were to come in person
and present "himself before the acclama
tions of the French nation? livery French
peasant knows Com Paul's face and ho Is
admired throughout the country as much
as ho is in the Netherlands, but the Quai
d'Orsay does not wish to cause any
trouble with England. A demonstration
to President Kruger would have the effect
of displeasing Mr. Chamberlain. If the
decision rests with M. Delcasse alone we
may be sure that the hero of the South
African war will be asked to go else
where." Â¦ â¢ ........

that it was not to the interests of his trust to

American people, to the disgust of most of the

this trust magnate forced Mr. Payne to aban

He dwelt at great length on the Porto

tribute, saying most of them had been

few words personal to President Kruger.
Mr. Bryan arrived at Muskegron a few
minutes before 6 o'clock and here had
the â¢ rtrst of his night meetings. He re
mained at that place for almost an hour
and addressed by far the largest audience
of the day up to that time. In his speech
at this place he referred at some length
to a report of a recent visit to Porto Rico
made by ex-Governor Pattlson of Penn
sylvania, - '
Mr. Bryan made two speeches In Grand
Rapids to-night. The first of these was
made in Campau Square and the crowd
covered almost the entire area. There
the Democratic Presidential candidate
made a comparatively brief speech; His
audience was vociferously demonstrative.
He then repaired to the Auditorium,
where he made the principal speech of the
evening. This hall seats 4000 people, and
not only was every seat taken, Wit every
available bit of standing room was occu
pied. Among those seated on the Btage
as vice presidents were a dozen or more
men who had supported Palmer and
Buckner in 18%. Among these were Ed
win F: Uhl, ex-Mlnister to Germany: C.
S. Hazeltine, ex-Consul to Milan* Chief
Justice Champlin, ex-Postmaster Carroll
and ex-Representative "White.
In his speech Mr. -Bryan discussed the
principal Issues of the campaign. In
speaking of the trusts he said: . .
"When election comes the trusts, con
trolling thousands of men, will offer them
the alternative of. voting the Republican
ticket or enforced idleness and destitu
tion. We have already had instances of
that. We have had men propose to their
employes that they should lay off and wait
until the election showed which party
would win before they could come back
to work. A man In Des Moines, Iowa, the
other day, who had charge of a shoe fac
tory, notified his men that he was afraid
ho could not continue in business if I was
elected, and so some Democrats organized
another shoe company and announced
that they would employ every discharged
workman at a 10 per cent advance if I
was elected. In your own State a furni
ture manufacturer notified his employes
that he would discharge them if they left
work to attend our meetings to-day, and
another man, a Democrat, tcld the men
that he would re-employ every man dis
charged because he wanted good Demo
crats.
"But. my friends, I only pive you this as
an Illustration of what Republicans will
resort to if they can aid the managers of
Brcat concerns to dictate the politics ot
the country. In 1S36 men boasted that they
would go Into bankruptcy if I was elect
ed. One firm In Wasnington, D. C, said
that If. I was elected It would not con
tinue in" business, and within a week after
election it went into bankruptcy, although
its own candidate was elected.
the opposite principle* of those which the
President had recommended a few week* be
fore. This Porto Rican bill Is now on our stat
ute books. Is a part of tha laws of our coun
try, baa tha sanction of our Government
and It embraces every one of the
principles that King George fought for one
hundred and thirty odd years ago. If tais bill
Is right then our fathers were wron*. if this
bill Is right, then the people of New England
owe It to yourselves and you owe It to man
kind, to tear down the monuments which cover
your hills and which tell of the glories of the
revolutionary fathers, for those monuments to
them tell and teach a lie.
If this Porto Rican Uw is right, then you owe
It to yourselves and you owe It to mankind, to
erect In the place of these monuments an altar
upon which to burn lncenaa to the memory of
King George. You may read history, you may
search the annals of man, and In no land, un
der do sun. and among no people, will you find
a parallel case. One trust magnate hurries from
New Tork to Washington and he compels the
Government of this mighty republic to face
about on a great question Involving the basic
principles of government. One trust magnate
was more mighty at Washington than the sen
timent of eighty millions of American people.
And yet In spite of ' this fearful object lesson.
In spite of this humiliating example, there are
men in this land to-day so lost to truth, so dead
to shame that for the sake of carrying an elec
tion, for the sake of getting some miserable
offices, they are willing to Insult the intelli
gence of the American people by telling them
that If they only re-elect Mr. McKlnley then
the trusts will be restrained. "But," sajs some
one, "do we not generously give back to Porto
Rico the money we collect from her In the form
of taxes?" This law makes that Industrious,
frugal and Independent people objects of char
ity In the sight of mankind. And we are not
even gentlemanly about that. We do not reach
into our own pockets and hand them our
money. "We use the power of this mighty re
public to take from them their hard-earned
dollar, their sweat and their blood, and then
we dole it back to them In the form of alms.
Now comes the President and tells us that he
Is gotns to give our colonies the blessings of
civilization and good government, and our ex
perience thus far Is an illustration of what good
government means. Some time ago they wanted
a man to manage the finances of the Postal
Department In Cuba, and they sent out and got
an Ohio politician, whose only recommendation,
so far as we can learn, wan that he had helped
Mark Hanna steal a Senatorshlp In Ohio. An 1
he managed the finances of the Cuoar.s so w!l
that after a few months there was no money
left 'or tnybody else to manage.
Now they have htm indicted, but his lawyers
laugh, and say that there is no law under which
he can be punished. After our CtvU War we
had an experience in giving good government
to the South by means of carpet-bassers, and
the decent people of the North finally got so
ashamed of it that they rose up and wiped It
out, and It took that country nearly a genera
tion to recover from the debts and burdens
with which the carpet-baggers had covered
their lands.
The principle is at fault. The principle of
brute force Js twin sister to corruption. They
have come hand in hand down the ages. They
will go hand in hand until the final triumph of
Justice and equality shall drive them from the
earth.

NEW YORK, Oct. 10.â General Ben
jamin Harrison gave out an In
terview and statement to-nlgbL
He vu asked:
"Is It true that you have con
sented to make some speeches In the cam
paign?"
"No. that statement has not been au
thorized by me," Â¦was his answer.
"I have said to every one who haa
tpoken or written me on the Etbject that
I eould not do any more campaign work.
I began to make Republican speeches the
year I began to vote and have had a
laborious, if unimportant, ran In every
carepaigm. State and national, since, until
IS9S. In 1S96 I submitted myself to very
hard usage and then made up my mind
and so said to my friends that I wouH
do no more campaigning. Following: this
conclusion I declined to take a speaking
part in the campaign of 1S9S. My retire
ment dates from that year, not from this.
Few men have made more speeches for
their party than I have and no ex-PresI
dent. I am sure. hajÂ» made more. Since
I left Washington my retirement from all
participation In party management has
been complete. All that 1 have left to
others, and I think they have very gen
erally and kindly accepted my sense of
the proprieties- of the case â at least be
tween campaigns. In a word I have va
cated the choir loft and taken a seat la
the pewsâ with a deep sense of gTatitude
to my forbearing: fellow-cour.trymen."
"But. general, it is said that you are
not altogether in accord with your
party?"
"Well. I have heard that my silence was
imj>uto<i by some to that cause. Now the
only public utterance I have made in crit
icism of the policies of the party was con
tained in the interview, consisting; of one
rather short sentence that 1 gave to the
newspapers while the Porto Rico bill was
rending. It was. in substance, that I re
garded the Mil as a grave departure from
rtjrht principles. I still think so. I don t
believe that the legislative power of Con
gress in the territories is absoluteâ and
J do believe that the revenue clause re
lating: to duties and imposts applies to
I'orto Rico. These views I know are not
held by many able lawyers. It Is a legal
questionâ one that the political depart
ments of the Government cannot fully
adjudg-e. The final and controlling word
upon this question is with the Supreme
Court of the I'nited States. Cases involv
ing the question-are. 1 understand, peno-
Ir.jf, and a decision in which we all must
acquiesce cannot be much deferred I
think, therefore, that voters oujrht to votÂ«

questions that are directly ao<i finally in

VANCOUVER. Oct. 10.â The Canadian
Department of Marine and Fisheries" has
rejected the proposal of the United States
Government to erect a salmon hatche.-.
on the Fraser River, in Canadian terri
tory. The Canadian Minister of Marine
thoi'ght this was meant as an interference
with Canadian rights and refused to rec
ognize it. In his refusal he is not careful
cf the language he uses in speaking of a
neighboring Government's friendiy offer,
which he styles an "absurd scheme."
The American Government several years
ago announctd its willingness to appro
priate at least a portion of the amount
required for the erection of a salmon
hatchery to aid In replenishing the salmon
supply of Puget Sound. This is fed by the
Fraser River from the Canadian side. It
was first suggested that some tributary
01 the Fraser in the State of Washington
be useel as a location for the hatchery,
but this was found to be impracticable,
as the hatchery would of necessity be too
far up the stream if it were kept in Amer
ican territory- Then the American au
thorities proposed that if the Canadian
department were willing they would ex
pend their money on the Fraser River on
the Canadian side of the boundary line,
as there is would be most beneficial to the
salmon Industry on the American side In
Puget Sound.
Although this offer to expend money
outside of the State was a new departure,
it was thought best by the American au
thorities to co-operate with the Canners'
Association of British Columbia. ThÂ«
canners put the proposition before thG
Canadian Government and the Minister of
Marine has replied that his department
would take no part In the "absurd
scheme." +

I SAN DIKGO, Oct. 10.â The largest meet
ing thus far held In San Diego during this

ernor Gage, whose carefully prepared ar
gument on the Republican side of the
questions of imperialism and militarism,
which the speaker characterized as hol
low sounds, was frequently interrupted by
applause.
â¢ The Governor arrived on the noon, train,
having been met at Oceanside by mem
bers of the reception committee, which
had carefully planned for his coming and
for the meeting to-night. Hundreds of
citizens of both parties were gathered at
the N-street depot when the train ar
rived and the chief executive of the State
was warmly welcomed to the southern
most city of the commonwealth of which
he is the Governor. In a parade he was
escorted from the depot to the Hotel

for the meeting this evening.

he desired to convince. Only once or twice
did he permit himself to turn aside from
the manuscript, and then only to answer
some criticisms of the particular, portion
of the speech which he was then reading.
He spoke on reciprocity and in an hour

argumentative address which has been
heard here during this or any recent cam

LOS' ANGELES, Oct. 10.â The popular
ity of the Southern California Women's
Parliament was attested at the session
this morning, when a motion to disband
the organization was made. Ever since
the parliament convened yesterday morn
ing rumors had been afloat that some of
the members were in favor of disbanding
and merging the movement into that of
the State Federation. There was much
suppressed excitement throughout the
session of yesterday, and a large number
of the women who believe that the par
liament should be an organization distinct
from the federation were prepared to
work earnestly to that end.
Mrs. Kate Tupper Galpin arose this
morning and moved that the parliament
should adjourn sine die, there being an
animated discussion. It did not take long
to prove that the motion was very unpop
ular. It met overwhelming defeat.
A matter which has come before the
Women's Parliament is that of the King's
Daughters' Day Nursery of Los Angeles,
and although there were other interesting
subjects for discussion there was none
that received more favorable considera
tion. The day nursery Is a local charita
ble institution, which for years has been
struggling to accomplish a class of phi
lanthropic -work that is not touched by
the more pretentious charities, and It has
received the commendation of many who
believe that to save the child from the
temptations of the street is to make good
citizens of those who would otherwise be
exposed to the forces that develop crim
inal lives.
Mrs. Mary Porter Haynes of Prospect
Park read a paper beginning with a gen
eral outline of such work as carried out
in the various large cities of the world.
Coming to the local necessities, she told
of the recent gift of property which would
enable the managers later to own a nur
sery of their own, and urged that steps
be taken looking to the establishment of
a children's hospital in Los Angeles. ,

filed soldiers' additional homestead scrip,
under which immediate title is possible,

REDWOOD CITY, Oct. lO.-Greater
progress was made in the Mitchell mur
der case to-day than was expected. Be
fore noon a jury had been sworn in and
the taking of testimony commenced.
William Mitchell, the prosecuting wit
ness, occupied a seat within the railing
during the entire proceedings, and fre
quently conferred with the prosecuting
attorneys. It is noticeable that the old
man has failed physically within the last
few months, owing, as he states, to his
being constantly on guard to protect his
life. Mitchell has not been placed on the
witness stand as yet. but the prosecution
announced this afternoon that it probably
would close Its case by to-morrow noon,
as it had only two more witnesses to ex
amine â Dr. Ross and William Mitchell.
When Mitchell testifies he will positively
identify Ehlers as the man who killed
his wife.
Deputy Coroner Claude Fox testified to
day to having visited the Mitchell and
lmsand premises on the morning of July
5 in company with the Coroner's jury and
Sheriff Mansfield. He found the bodies of
Elizabeth and David Mitchell lying beside
the hog pen in the Mitchell yard. Both
were fully clothed. That of David was
on its back and the body of Elizabeth
lay face downward. The latter was cov
ered with a canvas and some old hay.
There was a bullet wound in the region
of the heart. In company with the Sher
iff, Fox went to the lmsand premises.
Entering the kitchen he searched the
stove and found in the ashes a discharged
32-40 caliber Winchester cartridge. The
Sheriff picked up a sjmilar one from the
floor. He returned to the Mitchell place
and assisted Dr. J. I*. Ross in making
a post mortem examination.
In the hog pen the witness found a bul
let hole having its entrance on the side
toward the lmsand house and its exit on
the Mitchell place. The bullet had pro
ceeded from the direction of the kitchen
window of the lmsand house. He found
another bullet hole near by, and concluded
it had come from a small window near the
kitchen door of the same place.
Thomas O'Malley and John Roper testi
fied that they saw William Mitchell on
the night of July 4, about 9:30 o'clock,
and that he had a rifle with him at the
time.
Sheriff J. H. Mansfield testified that on
the 7th or 9th of July he had made an ex
amination of an outhouse back of the
lmsand dwelling and found two 32-40 Win
chester rifles rolled up in sacks and hid
den away. He had a conversation with
William Mitchell regarding the murders.
Mitchell told him the men who did the
shooting were in the kitchen window of
the Imrand house, and had a rifle resting
on the window sill. He saw two men
standing there, describing 1 Lemoscher as
"the man with bushy whiskers" and
Ehlers as the man who lived in a house
close by, pointing It out. Mitchell said
eight or ten shots were fired from the
same direction.
An effort was made by the defense to
get before the jury details of former dif
ficulties between Mitchell and lmsand,
when twenty or thirty shots were fired
by the men at one another, but this was
objected to. â¢

Mysterious Death of Ah Kim at the
San Pedro Shrimp-Fishing
Camp.
SAX RAFAEL, Oct. 10.â Ah Kim, a
member of the Point San Pedro shrimp
fishing colony, has disappeared. Several
of the Chinese there say he was drowned
in the bay during a heavy squall and
that he was struck on the back before he
went overboard. How or with what he
was injured they profess not to know.
Twenty dollars has been offered for the
recovery of his body. Local officials be
lieve Ah Kim was murdered and that hid
fellow-countrymen are endeavoring to
prevent the facts coming to light. Deputy
Constable John Smith la of the opinion
that if the body is recovered a mortal
wound will be found in the back. The
wily Celestials are taking time by the
forelock by declaring Kim was injured
before the capsizing of his craft, so they
will be In a better position should the
body be found.
There has always been s.:rife between
the factions at the shrimp camps. They
adjust their own differences and officers
of the law are never called upon to Inter
fere in their quarrels. They maintain a
small China of their ownâ government,
courts and all.
A Chinese with the body of a man In his
small boat came to the wharf at San
Quentin this afternoon. George Guldager.
an employe of. the North Pacific Coast
Railroad, notified Coroner Eden, who left
for the point to take charge of the re
mains. When he arrived the Chinese had
disappea^bd. From what the men saw
of the body it appeared to be that of a
white man and had been In the water
some time. However, it is probable that
the body is that of Ah Kim. and that it
has been taken to Point San Pedro, where
it will be buried as secretly as possible.

LOS ANGELES. Oct. 10.â ThomM C. MorrU.
a teamster, was struck on the heal by a piece
of timber which fell from his wagon this after
noon and instantly killed, his skull being

CHINESE BELIEVED TO
HAVE BEEN MURDERED
to the town. For the past two years resi
dence after residence has been entered by
a burglar, and several business places
have been robbed. During all that time
not the slightest clew was left behind by
the mysterious thief until last week, when
the diligence of Constable Wall resulted
in the arrest of Beebe as he was going to
Los Angeles to dispose of the proceeds of
a recent midnight raid. When he con
fessed having stolen the articles found in
his wagon, it Was at once surmised that
he was the culprit who had committed all
Quentin Prison, and the property
owners of Corona 'are rejoicing that his
two years' career of petty thievery has
been brought to' a close. Beebe was ar
raigned before Superior Judge Noyee at
Riverside yesterday and entered a plea of
guilty to the charge of burglary preferred
against him' by Charles W. Main of Co
rona. The prisoner meekly appealed to
the mercy of the court, but Judge Noyes
sentenced him to five years' imprison
ment in San Quentin. To-day Sheriff Co
burn started northward with Beebe to
place him behind the walls of Warden
Agulrre's hostelry.
The arrest and conviction of Beebe are
still the sensation of the hour in Corona
and vicinity. Since he came to the town
two years ago he, until his arrest on Sat
urday, was regarded as an honest, up
right citizen. A prominent member of the
First Baptist Church, he for two years
played the role of pious hypocrite and no
one In the town suspected his real charac
ter. In tracing a long series of burglaries
to Beebe Constable Wall showed detective
ability of a high order.

TUCSON, Ariz.. Oct. 10.â George Owlnts.
a member of the gang of bandits that
held up the Arizona and New Mexico
train at Falrbank several months ago,
made a confession of guilt to-day during
the trial of Brown, one of the leaders of
the band. Owints said that Burt Alvord.
who was then a peace officer at Wilcox,
organized the gang and planned several
hold-ups, of which that at Fairbank was
the first. Bravo Juan was named as cap
tain and had charge of the robbery. The
gang was composed of Alvord, Stiles,
Burts, Brown, the Owints brothers and
"Three-Finger Jack." Alvord was after
ward found to be. the man who planned
and carried out the Cochise robbery of a
Southern Pacific train, and he told Owints
that it was easy to prove alibis, as he had
a dozen men in Wilcox who would go on
the stand and testify to save them in case
arrests were made.
The story of Owints created a sensation
in court, as Brown is the first of the train
robbers to come up for trial. The confes
sion was a complete story. It was told
with graphic effect; every detail and cir
cumstance were givenâ the days of plan
ning, the craftiness of Burt Alvord in pro
viding protection for the men who were
to take part in the affair and the prepara
tion for the first nefarious work of the
hand. There was not a word lost by the
jury or the crowd in the room.
George Owints and Louis Owints were
arrested with Alvord. Stiles. Bravo Juan,
Downing. Burts. Brown and "Three-Fin
ger Jack" soon after the Fairbank rob
bory. Very little was known of the
Owints brothers, and but for the confes
sion made by "Three-Finger Jack" when
he was found dying upon the trail of the
fleeing bandits after the hold-up these
men probably would not have been sus
pected.
Owints told of the part taken by Al
vord; how he organized the gang and
commissioned Bravo Juan its captain.
Every possible protection was afforded.
Alvord looked after all preparation, but
lie remained behind and let the others do
the work.
Owints described the hold-up. .He even
repeated the words uttered, showing that
remarkably retentive memory thÂ»t is pos
sessed only by men who live on the
ranges. He says the bandits met at the
house of Brown at Pearce. From there
they rode over to Dragoon Mountains and
camped for the night. There the band
was organized with Bravo Juan as cap
tain. Gathered in the recess of a canyon,
with the flickering campfire throwing
weird shadows about, these desperate men
took an oath to kill the first one who
showed fc-ar when the crisis came. Hav
ing completed their arrangements, they
lay down to sleep.
On the morning of the 15th they pre
pared to start. The party divided, to re
unite in the river bottom a few miles be
low Fairbank. There the outlaws waited
for night and the coming of the train.
The story of the flopping of the train,
the shooting of "Three-Finger Jack" by
Messenger Milton and the wounding of
Milton by Brown is a story which has
been published many times. The gang
was trailed, and when "Three-Finger
Jack" was found he gave the names of
his associates out of revenge for their
leaving him to die on the trail.
The robbers were captured and placed
in Tombstone jail. "Billy" Stiles, who
also had given evidence against his com
panions, was allowed the freedom of the
jail. One day he shot Jailer Braven and
released Alvord and Bravo Juan. Stiles,
after being free two months, came in and
gave himself up. Alvord and Bravo Juan
are the only members of the gang not
captured. All the train robbers are in jail
here, and the confession of Owints means
the conviction of each.
Following the confession. George Owints
and his brother Louis pleaded guilty to
the charges against them.

SANTA BARBARA. Oct. 10.â The bat
tleship Wisconsin arrived this forenoon.
She has nearly her" full armament in
place and is prepared for the trial trip
to-morrow morning. The Wisconsin left
San Francisco at noon yesterday, arriv
ing: off Point Conception at S o'clock this
morning, having slowed down four hours
6n account of the fog. There she took
the trial speed course and ran over it
thirty-two miles in contract time. From
the east beacon of the course to the Santa
Barbara light beacon she steamed much
in excess of contract speed for a distance
of four knots. In an Interview this after
noon Irving M. Scott said:
'"We had a line trip down. Everything
was simply perfect. She is certainly one
of the best boats the Union Iron Works
ever turned out. We are only required
to make sixteen knots, but we will not be
able to hold the engines down to that.
The Wisconsin will leave at 8 o'clock a.
m. to-morrow, the weather permitting, for
the trial speed trip, which is four hours,
full steam ahead, at a rate of sixteen
knots. This la one knot more than was
required of the Oregon, which, however,
made a spurt during the trial, reaching
seventeen and ftfteen-hundredths knots.
It is expected that th* Wisconsin will do
nearly as well, though she Is 1000 tons
heavier and no premium is offered for ex
cess speed as in the case of the Oregon."
Captain F. A. Pellsbury of the Pacific
Mail line will command the Wisconsin. In
place of Captain Minor Goodall. who has
always commanded the Union Iron Works

coolness between the doctor and his wife
and a possible recourse to the divorce

take the initial step, but it now develops
that the doctor made the first move. A
couple of months ago Mrs. Pierce packed
her belongings and took apartments at
the Hotel Vendome. where she Is now
stopping. Dr. Pierce occupies his home
Jit the corner of Second and St. James
streets.
The Pierces were married twenty years
ajro in the East. There are no children.
He is possessed of considerable wealth,
and it is said a division of this has been
agreed to. Mrs. Pierce, before her mar
riage, was Miss Frances Parker. She
comes of an old and influential family of
Massachusetts.
About fifteen years ago Dr. Pierce came
to San Jose. He built up a large prac
tice, and he and his wife were warmly
received In high society. No social func

CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY
Encouraging Report Made by Arch
bishop Keane at the Meeting of
- the Board of Trustees.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 10.â Cardinal Gib
bons presided at the annual meeting of
the board of trustees of the Cathollo Uni
versity of America in McMahon Hall to
day.
Archbishop Christie of Portland, Or.,
was among those present. Two sessions
were held. In the morning the Cardinal
delivered a brief address in which he
spoke of the success which haa followed
the establishment of the university. Tho
reports of committees, largely of a rou
tine nature, consumed most of the time.
At the afternoon session Archbishop
Keane, formerly the rector of the univer
sity, who secured a two years' leave of
absence from his studies in Rome for the
purposo of raising funds for the endow
ment of the* Institution, spoke. He said
that during the year he had secured $70.
000 for general expenses and $100,000 for
the endowment.
Rector Conaty stated that during the
year he had received $50,000 in cash, part
for current expenses and part for endow
ment of chairs. Tho Knights of Columbus
had endowed a chair which will be de
voted to American history, while' five
other chairs will be endowed as follows:
The Michael Cudahy. the Catholio
Knights of America, the Archbishop Heu
nessy, the Archbishop Williams and the
Archbishop Kendrlck chairs, all of which
will be paid for this year. The rector
also reported that $01,000 in other subscrip

GAINS FOR LIBERALS
IN THE COUNTIES
Are Victorious in Cardiff and the Ot
ley Division of Yorkshire, Thus
Equalizing the Party Increase.
LONDON. Oct. 11, 3:30 a. m.â The Lib
erals nave been doing far better in the
counties in the parliamentary general
election than they did in the boroughs.
Yesterday they gained two more s*ats â
Cardiff and the Otley divfsion of York
shire â thus equalizing the party gains.
The Ministerialists and the opposition
have now gained twenty-seven seats each.
Apart from Sir Henry Campbell-Banner
man's reduced majority In Stirling burghs
and the success of Sir Edward J.-Reed at
Cardiff, a seat formerly held by James
McLean, prominent in Indian affairs, who
did not seek re-election, there Is little of
special interest in yesterday's returns.
The -Ministerialists now hold 357 seats
and the opposition 205. Sir Henry Camp
bell-Bannerman, addressing his support
ers after the poll had been declared, said
he was satisfied with the result as the
"most disadvantageous circumstance for
an election that an ingenious government
could devise." t
An excellent performance of "Rigolet
to" was that given at the Tivoli Opera
house last evening, with Russo, Repetto,
Ferrari, Polltini and Nicolini in the cast.
All the singers were in admirable voice.
Ferrari ia at his best as tho sad Jester.
Russo sings the Duke of Mantua role
with utmost spirit and tenderness, and
Repetto's Gilda is one of the most thor
oughly satisfactory parts In this charm-
Ing little songstress' repertoire. Politinl
and Nicolini repeated their successes as
the brigand and his sisterâ Sparafucile
and Maddalenaâ and chorus and orchestra
as usual did effective work.
To-night "The Jewess" will again be
given, and a crowded house will appre
ciate the fine Interpretation accordea the
difficult opera by Berthald, Lucentl, Stew
art and Lichter.
The symphony concert announced for
the 25th inst. at the Tivoli Opera-house
bids fair to be one of the most successful
musical and social events of the winter
season, and will certainly fill a long-felt
want.
For an entire change of bill the Cali
fornia Theater last night announced, in
stead of "Ernani," an arrangement of
"Azzall, or The Vanishing Impresario,"
by Oppenhelmer, the "boy manager."
Mr. Oppenhelmer expresses himself as
wearied of the hoodoo Itallano, and wili,
for a change. Indulge in the Hindoo vari-Â»
ety. beginning next Sunday afternoon. In
the meantime the theater will be closed,
and the retiring opera company will rest
before its triumphant reappearance as
the Tivoli next week.
"A Hindoo Hoodoo." a highly original,
and, it Is understood, a cleverly worked
out farce comedy, will Include Anna Boyd
in the large cast. It will run for one
week only and the salo of seats opens
this morning.
The production of "Quo Vadls" at the
Columbia Theater Is attracting special
attention by Its admirable staging and
excellent incidental music,* which is well
given by the large orchestra. "Quo
Vadis" will be the Columbia programme
all this and next week, with the ex
ception of Sunday. â¢ â¢
"We Una of Tennessee" has had a most
successful run at the Alcazar, and will
remain on the boards until next Sunday
evening. The old Dumas play, but rare
ly heard now, of "The Corslcan Broth
ers" will be put on next Â¦week. â¢
The worthy production of "A Texas
Steer" at the Alhambra- Theater is re
ceiving the Cfnerous support which It bo
well deserves. The colored quartet Is. a
deservedly popular feature of the popu
lar show. Next week "The Man from
Mexico." . ?r->".
Camllle d'Arville may still be heard at
the Orpheum, and the really marvelous
juggling performance of the "Great Ever
hart" Is another most successful number
of the good bill.
The "Congo Family" is still receiving
at the .Chutes and Zoo, and the sweet
singer, â¢ Jessie Padgham, is also to be
heard among other clever artists.
. Alice Raymond , the : cornet soloist, . Lil
lian Jcanette and her trained cockatoos,
and half a dozen excellent vocalists are
giving a pleasing programme at Fischer's
Concert House this week.

AT THE TIVOLI
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NAPA, Oct. 10.â Samuel M. Shortridge,
candidate for Presidential Elector on the
Republican ticket, addressed, a monster
mass-meeting at Napa Opera-house to
night) Mr. Shortridge taught school in
this county when a young man, and his
old friends of those early days came from
all sections to give him a hearty welcome.
His address was one of the ablest and
most eloquent ever heard In this city.
Mr. Shortridge reviewed the administra
tion of President McKinley, and ably dis
cussed all the Issues that are before the
people in this campaign. He urged every
voter to stand by the Republican party on
November â¬ â the party that represented
progress and national advancement.
The distinguished orator arrived on the
evening train and was met at the depot

The midweek reserve stake at I|.nlon
Park yesterday was productive of a h"igh
, order of coursing, due to strong hares
Â¦ and a disposition toward fast work on
i the part of the hounds. Brisk betting,
; enlivened by the unexpected victories of
1 a number of short enders, kept things on
j the hum.
T. J. Cronm's Daisy Dale won the stake.
The deciding course between this dog and
i F. A. McComb's Little Sister was an easy
! victory, for Cronln's hound. 12-0 being the
i Ecore, Little Sister had a hard time of It
i in the preceding courses, all of them being
i Jong and wearing. In the fifth round Lit
! tie Sister and Forget ran a two-minute
i course. Daisy Dale was fortunate In hav
' ing short courses.
The short-enders had their day and In
: many instances their . followers reaped

AT RECEPTION
CHICAGO. Oct. 10.â Laura Carroll Is
named as another victim of the Insurance
conspiracy syndicate, said to be headed
by Dr. Unger. The physician used her.
it is said, as a subject on whom to take
out policies In a game similar to that at
tempted with Marie Defenbach.
The Carroll .woman disappeared four or
live months ago and none of those with
whom she associated has seen her since.
During her residence here she was an
intimate friend of Miss Defenbach, and
is alleged to have been a patient and
sweetheart of Dr. Unger. Miss Carroll
was about 22 years of age. She was an
orphan and had a guardian. Dr. Gustav
Schmidt, living In Milwaukee, from which
city she came here. During the six or
seven months that F. Wayland Brown
was managing the Mooney & lioland of
fice here an unusual number of sten
ographers were employed. These were all
women, and all were employed by Brown.
The subsequent disappearance of many
of them is now deemed a matter worth
looking Into, as likely to show effort to
defraud on a much larger scale than haa
yet been brought to light.
The subjects on which the Unger-
Brown-Smlley syndicate secured insur
ance with fraudulent Intent are all be
lieved to be women, while the active mem
bers of the organization are men. There
are Indications that the organization had
a much wider scope than was first
thought It Is asserted by detectives that
at least two score of people are criminally
connected with It.
One of these, who Is now under surveil
lance. Is a wealthy and prominent law
yer. He Is alleged to be the financial
backer.
Indications That thÂ« Insurance Con
spiracy Syndicate Was Larger
Than at First Sup
posed.

THEORIES ABOUT CATARRH.;
Peculiar Ideas Begarding a Common i
Diseass.
Mark Twain's cure for a. cold in the i
head was simple, V>ut he claims very ef- !
fectlve in his own case. His plan was to
tat nothing whatever for twenty-four
hours or presumably until the trouble had
Â«Jiauppeared.
Although not able to speak from per- '
6onal experience as to the effectiveness of
tnis treatment, it certainly has the merit
ot extreme economy; but it occurs to us
that the application of It to a. case of
nasal catarih might be attended with dif-
litultie*
Catarrh, as *very one knows, is a
chronic cold in the head, and Mr. Twain's
treatment, if it should become a fad.
would make of us a nation of fasters; an
army, emulating the example of the im-
mortal Tanner, who achieved world-wide
lame by lasting forty cia.ys. ,
Cittarrh Is certainly becoming a national
disease, and there .is little doubt but that
errors in diet, particularly overeating, is
a very common cause.
Most people, however, are more inter-
ested la the cure of the trouble than in
the cause, arid modern medical science
has produced more effective and less
heroic remedies than Mr. Twain's.
PUfclaco! is a new remedy, very effective
in some forms of catarrh. KucaJyptol is
another, which on account of its unti-
:-Â«-ptlc properties is very valuable, while
many eevere cases of Chronic Catarrh
have been entirely cured by the sanguin-
aria or extract ef blood root alone.
Withlh a year an enterprising chemist
has combined all of these remedies in
;at>let form, palatable and convenient, and
the gopcrlonty of this tablet over other
catarrh remedies is bo apparent that all
tlrufitistF now carry thÂ«-m In stock to suy-
gily the popular demand.
They are called Stuart's Cata.rrh TaL-
letu, and it is doubtful If any medicine
ha* achieved a national popularity In so
Â».hort a time as this.
Btuart'* Catarrh Tablets are used bv
thousands of travelinn men because they
can be carried In the pocket and used
any time and in any quantity, being free
from cocaine, opiate or any poisonous
<irug.
They clear the heart and throat from the
disgusting cecretions of catarrh, very
often In a few hours' time.
For nasal catarrh they are far superior
to any wash, lotion or ointment, the use
c>t which Is often ox Inconvenient and an-
r.cyinB as the disease Itself.
For couphs. colds, bronchia] catarrh and
catarrh of the stomach these tablets give
immediate relief and a permanent cure
where lotions, douches and inhalers make
no Impression whatever. i
Thi? preparation Is a boon to' catarrh
ftiffcrers. and any druggist will tell you
That Smart's Catarrh Tablets la a remedy
that has come to ttay.

SICK WIDOW DROWNED
IN HER BATHTUB
Mrs. Carolina Anderson, a Sufferer
From Pneumonia, the Victim of
an Accident.
Caroline Anderson, a widow, 52 years
old, died In her bathtub yesterday morn
ing at her residence, 6C3 Harrison street.
She had been sick for a long time and
had been demented recently to such an
extent that she would not allow strangers
to approach her. Mrs. Anderson went to
the bathroom at an early hour, and her
daughter Leonie, becoming alarmed at her
long absence, visited the room and found
her mother's dead body in the tub. Cor
oner's r>t?puties Flynn and Donahue, who
went for the body, found that the water
had escaped from the tub by reason of the
plug of the waste pipe being partly out
of the socket, but the dead woman's hair
and face were wet as though her body
had been covered by the water.
Morgue Surgeon Leland performed an
autopsy and found that the woman had
beÂ«n drowned. She was also far gone
with pneumonia, and he expressed tho
opinion that she may have collapsed in
the bath and that the drowning was acci
dental. ;</::>:;:.;

The shoemakers employed by Bucking

day, will return to work this morning.
This statement is made by Mr. Weil, su
perintendent of the works, and also by
Humphrey Gallagher, who was made
manager of the interests of the employes.
All parties seemed last evening to be
pleased that the controversy had come
to an end so soon. As was published yes
terday morning in The Call, Mayson
holder, who was dismissed, has been re
instated.
Humphrey Gallagher said last evening
that the situation was satisfactory to tho
men. The conditions were those existing
before the employes walked out. Mayson
holder had been taken back. The ques
tion concerning the dipping of shoes by
the welters had not been a bar to calling
the men back to work. The shoes will be
dipped as heretofore. The concern did
not want to pay the wages of a boy to
moisten the channels. Every employe was
notified yesterday afternoon to return to
work this morning at the usual hour.
Superintendent Well said: "Work will
be resumed to-morrow and our employes
will all return. Maysonholder has prom
ised to conform to the rules and he has
been taken back. As to the welters, that
question was settled to the satisfaction of
all concerned."

who fchot Special Policeman Barry
Haughen in Fischer's Concert House on
O'Farrell street Tuesday night, appeared
before Judge Fritz yesterday morning: and
was Instructed as to his rights. The case
was continued till Saturday, when the de
fendant will be arraigned on the charge
of assault to murder.
The Judge asked Detective Dinan as to
Haughtn's condition, and he replied that
he had seen the doctors at the Receiving
Hospital, who said the wound was not
dangerous, although Haughen had had a
narrow escape. The Judge then fixed
Harold's bonds in f3>fJ>) or $15*) cash bail,
but during the afternoon reduced the
amount of bail to HOW, which was put up
by John F. Mullender, and Harold was
released. H. W. Wills, who was with
Harold Tuesday night, who was detained
in the "tanks," was also released from
custody yesterday afternoon.
Uetectives McMahon and DInan, who
were detailed on the case, reported the re
euit of tn^ir invÂ«sugations to Captain Sey
mour yesterday. Iney found that during
the performance Tuesday night Harold
and his wife and Wills and Mrs. Krellili^
came into the place. While one of the
artists was singing the two ladies kept
humming the song, thereby attracting the
attention of the audience to them. Fischer
*poke to them and they rose and started,
for the door. Harold asked Fischer if he
uan'j'd them to go out, and after they had
raised a disturbance Fischer called the
special policeman, who with the assist
ance of a bartender named Hess put them
out. Harold called Fischer an offensive
name and Hess struck him between the
eyes, blackening them.
In about half an hour Harold and Wills
returned. Harold walked over to the spe
cial and deliberately phot him. Fischer
saw the revolver in Harold's hand and
grappled with him after he shot the spe
cl&i. He succeeded in taking the revolver
from Harold with the assistance of a
waiter named Cameron. Mrs. Means, wife
of one of the waiters, and Miss, Costello,
who is employed In the place, heard
Harold say as h<? was leaving the first
time that he would come back and shoot,

STUART HAROLD
IS OUT OF JAIL
A lecture which proved exceedingly In
teresting- to his audience was that deliv
ered by the Rev. Father Joseph P. Mc-
Quaid last night to San Francisco Coun
cil Xo. 7, Young Men's Institute, in Pio
neer Hall. S. A. White, president of the
council, presided and introduced the lec
turer, who, after his address, was pre
sented with a diamond badge of handsome
design by W. H. Langdon in behalf of the
council. Mr. Langdon in his presentation
speech spoke of Father McQuaid's record
in the Philippines.
The lecturer entitled his address "A
Trip Through Two Continents," which
were Eastern Asia and Europe. The
starting point was at Honolulu, and the
speaker bade adieu to his hearers in
what, to his audience's delight, he termed
the "old land."
Of Honolulu the Rev. Mr. McQuaid
said that the leprosy, though apparently
I'ttle feared, is held in constant terror by
the inhabitants, who, while professing to
laugh at its existence, ward with extra
ordinary precautions against Its ravages.
Japan, the next place visited, was de
scribed as beine the home of a people
who were made up of a curious mixture
of immorality, dishonesty, simplicity and
politeness. "They are a hardy race/' said
Father McQuaid, "but are densely igno
rant and terribly regardless of the first
principles of hygiene. This accounts for
their enormously high death rateâ SO 000
to a birth record of 1.000.000. Fires in win
ter are comparatively unknown even in
the best hotels. Their place is taken by
small stoves which give little or no heat."
A graphic picture of the Catholic mis
sion work in China was the next subject
of the lecturer. He spoke of the Catholic
missions as being the only ones to be
found beyond a radius of a hundred miles
from a European settlement.
"The engineers who constructed rail
roads through Chinese graveyards re
gardless of this people's veneration for

BRIGHTER DAYS
IN EMERALD ISLES
PRESBYTERIANS
DISCUSS THEIR
FORMS OF FAITH
Local Ministers Will Oppose
Radical Revision of Their
Confession.
When the Presbyterian Synod of Cali
fornia meets next Monday at Berkeley
there will be no material changes In the
Westminster confession If the Presbytery
of San Francisco can prevent any by
united action. A proposition to revise this
confession, has agitated the Presbyterian
church of the United States for over a
year. In the Eastern States many sug
gestions, some of them radical and most
Important, have been made, but the West
has never placed Itself on record as op
posing any changes except verbal ones
in the credal articles of the Presbyterian
faith.
The Presbytery of San Francisco has
taken the Initiative In this matter and its
decision will doubtless have great weight
with other presbyteries in. the State. The
local ecclesiastical body has been In ses
sion to listen to proposed changes to the
confession, based upon Eastern agitation
and modlticatlon. The committee chosen
for this work was composed as follows:
Rev. Dr. Henry C. Minton, Rev. Dr. John
Hemphlll, Re\\ Dr. Robert Mackenzie,
Rev. Dr. Sturge and Elder W. P. Len
festy. The report which this committee
submitted was unanimously adopted by
the presbytery and now represents the
collective views of that body.
This report does no more than modify
the language of the Westminster confes
sion without making any essential change
in an article of faith. The language of
the confession In reference to predestina
tion, foreordlnatlon and the doctrine of
infant damnation is changed so 'us to be
more explicit. A suggestion is also made
to remove the prohibition upon marriage
between Catholics and Presbyterians.
These are the only changes which the
local presbytery will accept, and if the
synod attempts any more radical revision
the local body will vote unanimously to
dismiss the whole subject.
The United Presbyterian Church of Cal
ifornia has begun a series of sessions of
great importance to the denomination in
this State. The meetings are being held
In the First United Presbyterian Church
at Golden Gate avenue and Polk street.
The meetings include the autumn meeting
of the United Presbytery of San Fran
cisco, the eleventh annual meeting of the
Presbyterial -Young People's Society of
Christian Endeavor and the biennial meet
ing of the United Presbyterian Synod of
California. !
Representatives from all parts of the
State are present and the sessions will
continue morning, afternoon and night
during to-day and to-morrow. The ladles
of the First United Presbyterian Church
have made elaborate preparations to re
ceive and entertain the guests and dele
gates. The assembly rooms are daintily
adorned with flowers and lunches will be
served during the days of the meeting.
The first session was held last night
under the direction of the Rev. W. H.
French. D. D., of Easton. Cal. Dr. French
opened the services with devotional exer
cises. He was followed by the Rev. J. M.
Glllesple of Castrovllle, a candidate for
ministerial honors. The reverend gentle
man delivered an eloquent sermon, gave
the necessary answers to questions pro
pounded and was ordained to the gcupel
ministry. The opening J^ress of the
Young People's Society of Christian En
deaver.was then delivere'd by the Rev. J.
L. McKlttrick of San Jo.Â«e, who chose as
his theme the "Outlook Through the
Golden Gate of the Twentieth Century.
The meetings to-day will begin at 9
o'clock In the morning.

THE DUTY OF MOTHERS.,
What suffering frequently results
from a mother's ignorance ; or more
frequently from a mother's neglect to
properly instruct her daughter I
Tradition says "-woman must suf-
fer," and young women are so taught.
There is a little truth and a great deal
of exaggeration in this. If a young
woman suffers severely she needs
treatment, and her mother should see
that she gets it.
Many mothers hesitate to take their
daughters to a physician for examina-
tion ; but no mother need hesitate to
Â¦write freely about her daughter or
herself to Mrs. , Pinkham and secure
the most efficient advice Â¦without
charge. Mrs. Pinkham's address is
Lynn, Mass.
Mrs. August Pfalzgraf, of South
Byron, Wis., mother of the young lady
whose portrait we here publish, -wrote
Mrs. Pinkham in January, 1899, saying
her daughter had suffered for two
years -with irregular menstruation â
had headache all the time, and pain in
her side, feet swell, and was generally
miserable. Mrs. Pinkham promptly
replied with advice, and under date of
March, 1899, the mother writes again
that Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound cured her daughter of all
pains and irregularity.
Nothing in the world equals Mrs.
Pinkham's great medicine for regu-
lating woman's peculiar monthly

The arrival at headquarters of the heads without
j the bodies of these dignitaries may have a stimulating
effect upon 'the concert and give Waldersee an oppor
tunity to send a dispatch to the Kaiser. There are,
however, omens of disagreement among the allies
even upon that point. Some authorities are suspicious
the Chinese may give the Generalissimo a gold brick
in the shape of heads cut from the bodies of quite or
dinary Chinamen instead of the. heads of the'digni-
'About, the only thing that appears to have been
gained is the consent of the Chinese to surrender to
the Christian powers the heads which Kaiser Williatn
nas demanded as a preliminary to peace negotiations.
It has been announced that Ying Nien, president of
the Ccnsorate; Yang Yi, assistant grand secretary and
president of the Civil Board, and Chao Shu Chino,
president of the Board of Punishment, will be decapi
tated; that Prince Chwang, Duke Tsai Lan" and
Prince Yih will be sentenced to life imprisonment,
and that Prince Tuan.will be banished to the imperial
military post roads on the Siberian frontier.
Other capitals appear to have been more fortunate
than Berlin. They have heard about Waldersee, iÂ£
not from him, and the reports are by no means sat
isfactory. Thus a London dispatch says the. General
issimo has decided to divide the administration of
the railways in- Northern China between the Germans
and the Russians to the exclusion of all the other
powers. The action is said to be a proof of the
humble position Great Britain has been compelled to
take in that part of the Chinese empire, and of the in
difference of Germany and Russia to British interests
or British power.
Other evidences of Â«. lack of harmony are reported.
A dispatch to the New York Sun from Tientsin says:
"The growing unfriendliness between the troops of
the various nations has not been ameliorated by two
recent incidents. The English were invited to par
ticipate in an expedition sent to capture the Peitang
ports, and the Russians and Germans took the place
October 1 without waiting for the arrival of the Brit
ish. The other was when the British gunboat Pigmy
on September 30 landed a force of marines at Shan
haikwan and took the forts there. The Russians at
Port Arthur had planned an expedition against this
place and did not learn of the action of the British
until October 2."
Th|E MUDDLE IN CH.IN0.
T~^v ISPATCHES from the Orient and from
I ) various European capitals relating to Chinese
*-^ affairs show that the concert of the powers has
not beem improved to any fereat extent by the agree
ment to accept Count von Waldersee as Generalis
simo. Indeed a Berlin dispatch of the 9th stated that
up to that time no news of him had been received by
the German War office since the announcement that
he had arrived at the front and taken charge of af
fairs. It is said to be taken for granted that the de
tails of organization have absorbed his attention to
such an extent he has had no time to dictate reports.
There is something odd in the report that the Em
peror of Austria has forbidden the use of automobiles
in any way at the maneuvers of the Austrian army. It
has been believed hitherto that the Austrians were
keeping up with the procession in military matters,
but that report sounds different.

.THE COLORSâ Veteran. ' Santa Rosa,
Cal. The answer given to a correspondent
in this department relative to the placing
of the colors for decorative purposes was
strictly correct. The assertion that "blue is

only when the blue is studded with star*
then it represents the Union, and then
Â°. nIy ' A P iecp of blue bunting is only a
piece of blue fabric, and as the American
colors are red, white and blue, red is the
dominant color and shoula be placed at
the head. If blue Is placed at the head it
then represents the colors of France

Yet he possesses the power and does not remove
Assessor Dodge for attempting to divert $60,000 in
polltax commissions from the treasury into his own
pocket, notwithstanding the act constitutes a flagrant
violation of the charter!
Nor does he remove Treasurer Brooks for the same
offense. That gentleman has a suit designed to se
cure for him the collateral inheritance tax commis
sions alleged to be due him under State laws. These
will amount in two years to about $10,000. As in the
case of Dodge, Mr. Brooks* salary is fixed at $4000
a year, which is in full for all services.
Why does not Phelan remove, these gentlemen for
violating the charter? Is it because they are Demo
crats? Or is it because what they are doing suits
him?
Why. dors he vent his anger upon the poorly paid
?nd inoffensive clerks and deputies who are endeav
oring to protect themselves from his partisan Civil
Service Commission? Is it because they are mostly
opposed to him in politics, or because they are inter
fering with the forcible appointment of large num
bers of Charley Fay "organization** Democrats?
Phelan ought to take the people into his confidence
on this subject. \
The attack that a number of employes of the city are
making on the civil Eervlce is a serious matter. If it
is true that the real plaintiffs in the suit are men In the
offices of Assessor Dodg-e, Sheriff Lackmann. Coroner
Cole. Recorder Godchaux and County Clerk Deane, then
it is the duty of those officers to dismiss the offending
employes. The foes of the civil sen-ice have no' right
to hold positions in the city government. By becoming
parties to the suit in Question they have violated the
LAW, that is, THE CHARTER, they have conspired
to thwart the expressed will of the people who adopted
the charter by a great majority, and they have broken
their pledges to the people. These pledges were formu
lated In the party .platform, and both the Republican
and the Democratic parties in their platforms indorped
the civil service. If I were at the head of one of the
offices the employes of which are fighting civil service
I ehould discharge every mm that subscribed money to
pay the costs of the suit or otherwise countenanced
this attack on the charter. \
The charter provides that the Mayor may remove
the head of any elective office and send him before the
Supervisors for trial. If Phelan were in any one of
the positions now occupied by Dodge, Lackmann,
Deane, Cole and Godchaux he says he would re
move his employes for becoming parties to a suit to
test the civil sen-ice provisions of the charter.
As far as I know none of the attaches of the Assps
eor'c office are ;>arty to this attack. All my clerks and
d^rutie? effurp me that they are not !n the combination
to attack the civil service law. Furthermore, my clerks
assort that they knew notMng of the puit, except the
rumors which have been circulating about the City Hall
that an injunction v.-as to be asked for. I am not In
sympathy with this *-uit, but I AM IN FAVOR OF Sl'P
POKTING THE CHARTER AS IT STANDS. I believe
the law is good and will stand the test in the courts.
If Assessor Dodge is in favor of '"supporting the
charter as it stands" why did he a few weeks ago
bring a suit himself to annul a section which fixes his
salary? The provision in question says that the As
sessor shall perform all the duties required of him by
law for $4000 a year. Dr. Dodge's action not only
contemplates changing this, but if he wins it will re
sult in turning $60,000 in polltax commissions from
the city treasury during his term into his pocket.
This is saying nothing about the thousands that will
go the same way in other terms. Is this '"supporting
the charter as it stands"?
An evening paper, on the same subject, quotes
Mayor Phelan as saying:
A MORNING paper Tuesday, speaking of a suit
brought to test the civil service provisions oi
the Â¦ charter, quoted Assessor Washington
Dodge as having said:

PERSONAL MENTION.
issue. In fact. I think it Is the only issue
they will have.
There has never been any doubt in my
mind since the Democrats reaffirmed the
Chicago platform in the Kansas City plat
form that McKinley would be re-elected
by a larger majority than four years ago.
The farmers, who were discontented then
will vote for McKinley because of the
prosperous times. There are many other
things that have changrtyi In favor of
McKinley since four veara ago. All In
all. no American need fear when he votes
for McKinley that ne is votins for a
King'.
I know of many Democrats. " gonje of

Kinley this year. , , -

HEAD OF BIG BREWERY SYN
DICATE DESERTS BRYAN'S
CAUSE.
There is not a Congressional district in the State
where the Republicans cannot win a victory if thev
work hard. In each ense the party candidate is strong
personally. They are known among the most emi
nent of their fellow citizens and can be counted on to
uphold faithfully every interest of their constituents
p.nd of the people generally. They are, therefore en
titled to the support not only of the Republicans, but
of the independent voters of their districts, and in
every case they should receive it. California has much
to expect from the administration. Let ! us send a
solid delegation to support it.
It is to be borne in mind, moreover, that most of
the Republican Congressional'candidates in this. State
have had experience in the. House and are therefore,
for that reason as well as for others, much better fitted
to look after Californian interests in the House than
their opponents. These men have been tried in Con
gress and have been found faithful and efficient. Some
of them hold important positions on committees and
are able to be of greater service than any new man
could possibly be.
California should be represented at Washington by
a solid Republican delegation. Both Senators froin
the State are now Republicans. â¢ It remains to elect a
Republican from every Congressional district. It will
be of advantage in many ways to have a delegation in
harmony with the administration. There is much in
the way of Federal legislation and of appropriations
needed to advance Californian interests. These can
be obtained much better by Congressmen in harmony
with the Government than by those who would be
oppo?ed to it. Furthermore, even if State interests
were not concerned, the voters of California should
do their share in sending to Washington men who will
uphold the policies of sound finance, protection and
other Republican measures which tend to maintain
the prosperity of the people.
Republicans control the present House .by a very
narrow majority. That fact has been noted by the more
astute Democratic leaders, and, knowing that Bryan's
chances are but a forlorn hope, "they planned from the
beginning a skillfully devised campaign to capture the
House. In nearly every district they have nominated
about the best man they could induce to ' stand for
Bryanisfn, and as a consecjiience are in a position to
rally to the standards of the Congressional candidates
a much larger following. than they can get to support
the electoral ticket.- It is therefore a hard fight that"
awaits the Republicans in Â¦many a district, and voters
should fully realize the fact. ' .
It is hardly necessary to point, out to intelligent
men the importance of electing a House -of Repre
sentatives in harmony with the administration. Many
great measures are to.be dealt with by the next Con
gress. In the. short term that remains of the present
House there will be time for the transaction of little
more than routine business. It is probable the ship
ping bill, the Nicaragua canal .bill, the immigration
restriction bill and measures devised for the govern
ment of the Philippines may have to be postponed un
til the gathering of the next Congress. Should that
be so the Democrats, by obtaining control of the
House of Representatives, might and probably would
seriously hamper the administration in effecting the
needed legislation along lines conforming to Repub
lican principles.
THE FIGHT FOR THE HOUSE.
collected reports from all States
r . Â¦ . that have been considered doubtful render it
y^Tf-: ascertain as anything in politics can be that
McKinley will be triumphantly re-elected to Â¦ the
Presidency. The same reports, however, show that
thereis by no means the same assurance of the return
of a Republican majority to- the House of Represen
tatives. The fight in the Congressional district^ con
stitutes the danger point of the campaign, and to
those contests all loyal Republicans should now * give
their close attention and devote their energies.
. Out of the British elections there has come a new
phrase that may some day be of use here. Mr. Cham
berlain has been charged with being "a poisonal
menace to the world." It is understood that to be
poisonous is not half so bad as to be poisonal.

Indianapolis had grinned before, but when it read
this special it laughed. That is, all but the Bryan men
laughed. They turned their faces to the wall and
swore. That slip exposed the whole fake. Hearst's
writers had written up the whole iridescent rot in Chi
cago; it was never wired from Indianapolis at all.
It was not a truthful account of anything that hap
pened, and its circulation added to the humiliation of
the day's flat and mortifying failure. Not the least
among those who enjoyed it were the other Demo
cratic new-paper men, Who arc not pleased with
Hearst's constant use of party gatherings to advertise
himself and his three newspapers. They are growing
tired of his blpwhard tactics and representation of
himself as the whole thing.
Now by dint of drumming, and picking up often
only one man from a State, the rollcall showed just
twenty-one of the forty-five States. represented. The
largest marching club was the Cook County, Illinois,
just 128 strong. The Indianapolis Sentinel (Bryan
organ) published that the hall was not opened till
1:40 p. m., instead of being filled at noon. But the
humiliating exposure of the whole lying fake was the
account of the arrival oi Hearst himself, getting a
"roaring welcome" and inarching to the Grand Hotel
with Senator Jones, when he was not there at all.
About 2 o'clock the special train from Chicago pulled
into the Big Four station. Dozens of marching organ
izations were drawn up at the platforms, roaring out a
welcome, and W\ R. Hearst, president of the associa
tion, went at once to the Grand Hotel, accompanied by
Senator- James K. Jones, chairman of the Democratic
National Committee, and escorted by the leaders from
Chicago and the 300 delegates who came on the special
train.
It was long- after 2 o'clock when the convention was
called to order, but all roads led to Tomlinson Hall dur
ing the early morning hours. Hundreds were in their
seats at the noon hour waiting for the fall of the gavel.
During the mornlne special trains hurried into the
city from east, north, west and south. Thousands of
marchers were on the streets, their long lines dotted
with banners declaring for a republican government,
not an "empire," and against trust prosperity.
Those 7000 had come to Indianapolis from all sections
of the United States. They represented States from
Maine to California, and they brought the rallying cry,
"All for Bryan." / .
This, the quadrennial convention of the National As
sociation, eclipses every former meeting in the history
of the organization.

tion" which exhausted superlatives, bankrupted hyper

the frills, here it is: Jt
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Oct. 3.â Three thousand five
hundred delegates were seated in Tomllnson Hall when
the greatest convention known in the history of the
National Association of Democratic Clubs was called
to order.
About Â¦ them, thronging the galleries, 4000 people
cheered for Bryan and Stevenson and Democracy.
This rather contradicted Hearst's illness excuse.
But. the crowning fake was in the evening. Thou
sands of copies of Hearst's Chicago American "club
convention extra" were distributed in the convention
j r\ LL Indianapolis -was already on a broad grin
f-\ at theXfizzIe of Hearst's national convention of
. * Bryan/clubs. The railroads carried. in just 1500
passengers ticketed to the meeting. The largest out
side organization was the Cook County Democracy,
i 128 strong. Adlai Stevenson, candidate for Vice
President, drove in a carriage from the depot to Tom
linson Hall, preceded by two brass bands and followed
by just fifty-six straggling marchers. There was not
a cheer nor salute of any kind. The day before the
meeting and that day, up to 2 o'clock in' the afternoon.
was spent in trymg to find Hearst, the president,
whose flamboyant proclamation had called the host of
1500 together. At last he was discovered in Chicago
and excused himself from coining on the score of ill
ness. When Chairman Jones arrived in Indianapolis
he said: "We saw Hearst to-day in Chicago and he
said he was coming, but he was not on the train."

Editor San Francisco Call: I am going
to support- McKinley. * In the first place
I am not afraid of Imperialism. I think
It Is ridiculous to even debate that propo
sition. I know something of empires and
monarchical governments and I want to
say that if there were even the slightest
chance of an empire being established in
this country I would be one of the first
to rebelâ to shoot. If necessary. If there
really were any such prospect there would
be secret meetings at all hours of these
balmy nights and people would be arming
themselves. But there is nothing In such
talk. 'Imperialism Is a myth and the Dem
ocratic party will have to back down on
the .''paramount is^ue" proposition.
If there were any danger of imperial
ism there would be no Democrats and no
Republicans. They all would be anti-lm
perialists. We have gone through one
crisis with McKinley and he has proved
himself equal to the emergency.
Ixjoking- at the situation from a busi
ness standpoint he has opened new mar
kets for this country in Cuba, Porto Rico
and Manila. I .believa 'this nation to be
as intelligent as any other first-class na
tion and able to govern any new terri
tory that may come along under its Juris
diction to the satisfaction of the people. I
believe there is no doubt, so far as busi
ness is concerned, that if McKinley is re
elected there will be no business commo
tion; whereas, If Bryan Is elected, every
businessman will stdD to see what he
is going to do. thus bringing about .1
temporary standstill, which means much.
Bryan's financial views are the same
as four years ago and he would try to
have them enacted into law should he be

The announcement of his intention to
support McKinley is a surprise, as he
has been a life-long Democrat, and it
was thought that he would be with

following stat3ment Mr. I.ieber gives
his reasons for abandoning the De

The Chinese Government has been noted from of
old for duplicity, cruelty and bloodshed; but up to
this timethe allied powers of Christendom have done
nothing to set a better example to the Empress Dow
ager and her council. They have demanded of her
the heads of hÂ«r chiefs, and if some turn of affairs
should give her the power to make demands she
might with reason demand the head of Waldersee. It
is a bad muddle all round, so it is not surprising the
Generalissimo refrains from writing about,, it.

None can foresee the outcome of the quarrel
between foreign powers over the division of
China. Â¦Â¦ It is interesting to watch the going to
pieces of this ancient but unprogressive race.
Many people in America are also going to
pieces because of dyspepsia, constipation,
blood, liver and stomach diseases. We are
living too fast, but strength, vigor and good
health can be retained if we keep off and cure
the above diseases with Hostetter's Stomach

Mike Brown Says He Was Triced TJp
by the Wrists by thÂ«
Captain.
Mike Brown, a member of the crew of
the steam whaler Balaena. called ! upon
Assistant United States District Attorney
Banning yesterday and preferred a charge
of cruelty on the high seas against Cap
tain Bert "Williams. He accused the cap
tain of having had him triced up to the
mizzen rigging by the wrists for four
hours and a half 'when the mercury stood
below zero, inflicting permanent Injury
upon him by reason of such exposure.
The Balaena was locked up In. the ice for
the winter iq Franklin Bay. On June 12
Mate Porter ' reproved Brown for having
left his gun forward. Brown thereupon
retorted by saying that the mate was dis
criminating against him by allowing other
members of the crew to leave their fire
arms in the fore part of the ship. The
mate swore at him, and some time after
ward Captain Williams seized Brown by
the throat and beat him. He then triced
up Brown to the mlzzen rigging. Brown
complained that his arm3 have not yet
recovered from the tricing.
A warrant was issued for the arrest of
the captain.

T|HE Sierra, the first of the Oceanic
Steamship Company's new fleet
of flyers, sails from Philadelphia
for San Francisco to-day. She is
expected to make the run in thir
ty-five days and will therefore be here
to take up the November running on the

On her trial the Sierra proved herself
to be a smart and fast vessel and easily
averaged 17 knots.
The officers who will bring the Sierra
to San Francisco are all old employes of
the Oceanic Steamship Company. Captain
Henry C. Houdlette was formerly master
of the Maripoea; Chief Engineer W. H.
Neiman was formerly of the Australia:
Purser N. C. Walton Jr. was formerly of
the Mariposa; Dr. Milan Soule was for
merly of the Australia, and Chief Stew
ard William N. Hannigan was formerly
of the Mariposa,
The dimensions and a general descrip
tion of the new steamers have already
been published In The Call. They will be
the largest, handsomest and best
equipped vessels that have ever come to
this port and the advent of the Sierra will
mark a new era in the history of the
commerce of San Francisco.

OCEANIC STEAMSHIP COMPANT'S FIXE NEW STEAMER SIERRA, WHICH LEAVES PHILADELPHIA TO-DAY
FOR SAN FRANCISCO, AND HER COMMANDER. SHE MADE FAST TIME ON HER TRIAL, AND IT IS EX
PECTED THAT SHE WILL MAKE A RECORD RUN AROUND THE HORN.
PHILADELPHIA. Oct. 10.-A suit to re
cover Insurance on the life of his wife,
whom he killed on December 31. 1S03, has
been commenced In this city by Professor
Swithen C. Shortlidge, who is now resid
ing at Kennett square, in Chester County.
The suit, which Is to recover the sum of
$7022 from the Provident lAte and Trust
Company, is one of the most remarkable
in tho history of life insurance.
The tragedy which ended the life of
Mrx. Shortlidge was enacted in Media on
a New Year'B eve. and caused a great
sensation. Several years before that date
Professor Shortlirlge had pone to Media
with his wife and family and established
what was then known a.s the Media Acad
emy for Young Men. For several years
the venture was successful, the school
having a high class patronage. Then Airs.
Shouildg* died.
In November. 1S93, Professor Shortlldgo
married Miss Marie Dlxon Jones. Shortly
afier his second marriage the professor
began to act straneely. On the night of
the killing, six weeks after the marriage.
Professor Shdrtlidjre Invited his wife to
go out -with him for a walk. A short dls
tarco from the house he shot her through
Â¦the heart and then attempted suicide, but
was disarmed by a neighbor.
In the trial which followed Professor
Shortlidge was acquitted on the ground
o! insanity and was confined In an asylum
until a year ago.
There Is no case of a parallel nature In
the Insurance annals of this State. A life
Insurance man recalled a case which oc
curred at Sedalla. Mo., several years ago.
but which does not establish a precedent
for the present suit by reason of its su-.l
doaÂ» and tragic ending. A saloon-keeper
In that city insured the life of his wife
for JoOOC and then in a rage killed her by
forcing a red-hot poker down her throat.
Ho was put on trial for his life and after
a fierce lejral battle was acquitted on a
technicality.
After his acquittal he sued the life in
surance company and so far as law was
concerned he had it entirely on his side.
Public feeling had been wrought to such
a pitch, however, that no jury could be
found to give the murderer a verdict, and
finally the Indignant citizens ended the
matter by taking the plaintiff out and
hanging him to a tree.

It is a wonderful soap

docs no harm
! No harm 1 It leaves the
skin soft like a baby's; no
alkali in it, nothing but'
soap. The harm is done by
alkali. Still more harm is
done by not washing. So,
bad soap is better than
hone.
, What is bad soap? Im-
perfectly made; the fat
and alkali not well bal-
anced or not combined. "

Mail advices from Xcw Tork say:
"A new feature that aids to the strength of
the raisin situation very decidedly Is the ap
l>ear!!!icÂ« of Inquiry from Eriglish markets for
California layers and Sultana raising Nego
tiations ere understood to be under way which
may result in considerable new domestic goods
BOiBg to the other fide. New two-crown loose
raisir.s are becoming exceedingly difficult to
get. some packers having no more to offer.
>.-er?]ess muscatels continue In strong demand,
further bUFiness being heard of at ltilÂ»Â»c
1 Tedium. Offers of l l Â»c were refuted yester
day, iiott of the seedless for which high
prices are lieini paid are going to a certain
vWi known local operator. Sale* of unbleached
Sultar.at are reported nt from Vij'-c advance.
< >n Fpot. standard soeded raisins. New York
park. In 0:1c jxjund cartons, are selling quite
ir*-dy at t\Lc lor two-crown cr\ii RÂ£c for three
crown. Stocks of Valencia raisins are sreatly
1 educed. Saies were made yesterday at lO^jc
in a Jobbim; way. Imported Fultanas also are
in sime demand. A little inquiry is noted for
] rum?, a; rlccu?. peaches. eu\. but trade gen
erally Is dull. Srxjt ajÂ»ple* shew some activity,
sales of a couple of cars designated as prime
being rejiorted at 4'^c. Grades under prime
tr? felling tairiy well at irom 3'-SI4e.
"The currant situation Is firm. Â£ales in a
Jobbing way wen? reported at 12Hc for new and
l'c lor old. Nut? are rather dull."
Condition of California Crops.
Following Is the weekly report of A. G. Mc-
Adie. section director United States Weather
liurcau, for the California Crop Bulletin, for
the week ending October fc:
"Rain has lallen is all sections north of the
Tehachapi, varying from .10 la the southern
jiortion of the San Joaquin Valley to more than
two inches in Fome parts of the Sacramento
Valley and coast section, and light showerb
J;ave fallen in a few places In Southern Cali
fornia. The tem;>erature has been nearly
I'ormal p.nd during a portion of the week con
ditioTin were lavorable tor fruit drying.
Â¦ Late grapes on the vines were considerably
damaged by rain, anl in tome instances de
ciduous fruits and raisins on the trays were
injured, hut as ample warnings had been given
to all sections the darcape was principally con
fined to these places where vineyards and
â¢ iTchardisrs were urable to tecure sufficient la
l>or fcr stacking trays, and -to a few places
whore paper trays were in us*. Fruit drying
ar.d raisin curing were in most sections fur
ther advanced than usual at this time of the
year, and reports received at this office indi
cate that the Iobe will be very light. Warm,
drying weather has followed the rain and
will materially benefit the fruit drying inter
es-is. It Is believed the yield of deciduous
fruits and raisins will be nearly equal to the
eveiajte. Oranges are ripening rapidly in all
t-ecti<">ns and give Indications cf a heavy crop,
which will mature earlier than usual. Walnut
licking continue, and in some places the nuts
ore nearly reajy for market: the yield will
j.rubably fall below the average.
"Hoiis and b*arjs were generally harvested
find under cover liefore the rain commenced.
Packed barley in the fields was somewhat dam
aped. I'asturage was greatly benefited by the
rein, and green feed It. abundant in most sec
tions;. The coil Is generally In good condition
fcr plowing, ani farmers are preparing for a
larre acreage of grain for the coming season."

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Oct. 10.â Activity In the etock
market was very benumbed by the perplexitle*
of the money outlook. Sterling exchange and
the rates for money on foreign exchanges at
tracted more attention than did news of do
n-.-estlc event*, except as they affected some
si>eclaJ properties. Small interests as there
were In stocks, were mostly centered In special
tlr-s and the movement of prices there was lr
:<"gular. People's Gas was rather acutely de
pressed on the news of a general issue of in
junctions to prevent the company from charg*
Ing more than 49 cents for gas while that ratÂ«
Â¦was accorded to any of Its customers. LacledÂ«
Gas weakened, apparently In sympathy. Ten
nessee Coal and Sugar were also forced dowi
over a point on rather free selling:. Manhat
tan, on the contrary, showed a continuance oi
Its recent strength during the early dealing!
and Brooklyn Transit eeerwd In some demand.
American Tinplate, in the m*tal group, ros<
over & po4nt. and Hocking Valley as much
Except for the last named, stocks these ad
vances were all wiped out In the late reaction
The heaviness of the general list becamt
marked after only a brief resistance. Th(
movement of prices was very narrow and deal.
inr* so small that the net changes are not im
portant, but practically all of them are losses.
The large decrease In earnings of St. Paul foi
the flrct week In October was a depressing fac
tor. More loans were called to-day and th<
rate m-aa marked up to 4 per cent before <
new accommodation could be found. This wai
the dominant Influence In the market and th<
renewed fall la sterling exchange, which car
ried the rate down to the new level of gold 1m
ports, seemed to have little Influence in off
fwttinir the effect of the higher money rate
The Bub-treasury transferred half a mlllioi
dollars to-<lay to the Interior and the draft!
paid by that Institution during the week or
account of gold deposited at Pacific points I:
<ju!te Insignificant. At the preÂ«ent rate of de
pletion of New York bank reserves. It is evi
dent that Saturday's Btatement will phow thÂ«
eurr'us almost obliterated unless It shall b<
cffnet ty a drastic contraction of loans. An
other Â£54.000 was engaged in London to-da)
for Ehlpment to New York, but the discount
rates promnt'y responded with advances ex
tending to Â«, per cent, end It Is generally be
lleved that the Dank of England will advanct
the official rate to-morrow, as the private ratÂ«
hoe now gone above it. The sensitiveness oi
the foreign markets to threatened withdrawal!
of gold detract rrem the beneficial effect or
speculation here. The reported panic on the
Vienna bourse yesterday gives an unpleasant
Impression.
Inert were firm spots In the bond market,
but business was very dull. Total sales, par

CHICAGO, Oct. 10.â The wheat market held
fairly steady during the forenoon under the
influence of firmness at Liverpool and the cash
business yesterday when 550,000 bushels were
sold here for export. December opened at 77
@76%c, touched 77%e, dropped to 76%g76T4c.
and then rallied to 77Hc. Shorts were the best '
buyers. No particular cash support was forth
coming, however, but in its stead there was
selling by St. Louis Interests. This discour
aged the early buyers, who unloaded. Decem
ber, under this pressure, declined to 76%S"6Vjc,
at which fleure it closed, %c under yesterday.
Corn was dull and though steady early, linally
eased In sympathy with wheat weakness. De

New York Metal Market.
LONDON. Oct. 10.â At the wool auction sales
to-day 12,546 bales were offered. There was
good competition for crossbreds, of which the
bulk went to the home trade. Broken greasy
wool sold and New South Wales scoured were
ialrly competed'ror at steady prices, fine grades
realizing high prices. Cape of Good Hope and
Natal wools were In good supply, but dragged,
several lots being withdrawn. Superior snow
whites were in better demand at full rates. The
attendance was good.
The rales of the week in Boston amounted to
2,641.000 pounds domestic and 40,000 pounds for
eign, making a total of 2,SS1,000, against a total
of 2.62?,000 for the previous week and a total
of 4.46G.0O0 for the corresponding week last
year. Sales since January 1 amount to 101,
100.000 pounds, against 130.954,100 pounds for the
corresjK>ndinc time last year.
London Wool Market.
There has been a fair demand for wool during
the past week, mostly from the smaller mills
outside of the combine, comprising those mak
ing men's wear, worsted and woolens, dresa
goods and flannels. Some of the smaller mills
had, it Is reported, been waiting for the larger
consumers to take the initiative in the matter
of purchasing wool, but being very lightly
stocked, they have concluded to act Irrespec
tively of others and have accordingly purchased
some fair-sized lines of wools, especially Terri
tory, California and Texas and fine unwashed
fleeces. The wools were purchased to meet ac
tual requirements, there being still no evidence
of any speculative tendency. Prices hold pretty
steady, and where the consumer really wants
the wool the holder can secure practically as
good prices as he could a month ago. Tha
London wool- sales on Tuesday of this week
showed an average decline of 12Â»,4 per cent on
merinos, fine breds being quoted 7Vi@10 per cent
lower, but coarse and low crossbreds quoted
unchanged. The decline has been discounted
6ome time before.

Board Framing the New Charter for
Los Angeles Legally Constituted.
Interests the Coast.
LOS ANGELES. Oct. 10.â In department
6 of the Superior Court this morning
Judge Allen decided that the Los Ange
les Board of Freeholders, now framing a
new city charter, has a legal existence.
The legality of the board was called Into
question in a friendly way to enjoin the
City Treasurer from paying a bill incurred
by the board, the contention being that
the city had exhausted its right to elect
a Board of Freeholders under the State
law when the first board was elected sev
eral years ago. The contention of the
attorneys for the defense was that th<Â»
right to elect a Board of Freeholders and
to alter the city charter or substitute a
new one is permanent and can be exer
cised whenever the electors so choose.
The case will be appealed to the Su
preme Court and an effort will be made
to obtain a hearing Defore the full bench
next Friday.

STATES HIS SIDE
a Man Who Was Under
Arrest.
He Was Accused of Having Bobbed
Joseph Ahem, the Constable of Port
Costa, who was accused of arresting J. C.
Wells without cause and retaining part of
Wells' property, was in the city yester
day and told his side of the story. He de
clares that Wells was acting in a suspi
cious manner, and in company with three
other men was placed under arrest. When
asked to explain himself Wells, so the
Constable says, started to run away.
When told to give up his property he re
lated various stories of what he possessed
and finally gave the officer ?9S. Consta
ble Ahem has a series of affidavits to sup
port this; version of the arrest.
The next morning $90 was returned to
Wells, but the Constable had left $8, a
razor and a cheap watch at home. This
he offered to return to Wells that night,
but the arrested man said that the fol
lowing morning would be time enough.
He did not wait, however, so Ahern says,
and came to this city and made his com
plaint to the police. Ahern followed him
and delivered his money and other effects
to Captain Seymour.
Colonel Eddy, the well-known politician
and stump speaker, made the acquaint

and his lady friend had several drinka in
the saloon and then he accepted an invita

On their arrival at the woman's room
they were joined by a male friend of the
woman. More liquor was procured. The
next thing the colonel knew was that he
had been robbed of $120 in cash, a diamond
etud and a gold watch and chain. The
politician reported the matter to the police

ALAMEDA, Oct. 10,-Spirlted debate
marked the morning session of the Cen
tral Baptist Association at the First Bap
tist Church, the subject under discussion
being the amendment to be voted on at
the next election exempting church prop
erty from taxation. ' Rev. E. A. Woods
and Rev. George Hill were strongly In
favor of the amendment and as strongly
opposed to It were E. C. Lyon and Pro
fessor L. D. Inskeep. The vote of the as
sociation showed a sentiment In favor of
the amendment, it being 35 to 11.
Rev. Mr. NVoods stated that the amend
ment was only adopting the policy pur
sued by all other States of the Union to
exempt church property from taxation.
California was the only State that taxed
her churches. The proposed law exempts
the building used exclusively for religious
worship and the lot It stands on. He did not
consider that It was a step In the direc
tion of the union of church and state.
The churches furnished an equivalent for
taxation by advocating obedience of the
law and promoting good morals.
"The amendment is contrary to all Bap
tist usage." eald Professor Inskeep, in op
position. "It is against the policy of the
Baptist church to advocate a measure of
this kind. It will have a tendency to
unite church and state to which we are
all opposed. It will increase tWe burden
now borne by the taxpayers of the State,
already high enough. Somebody must pay
the taxes. There is a certain amount to
be raised to run the government and if
certain property is exempt from taxation
it will only tend to make It harder for
those who" have to foot the bills." â¢
The morning session of the association
opened with devotional services, led by
Rev. George Hill. Letters from thirty
two churches were read, in which the
progress made by each during the past
year was told in words and figures. Fol
lowing these were a half-hour devotional
and testimony meeting, led by Rev. J. M.
Helsley.
During the afternoon session the re
port of the committee on foreign missions
was received. There was a sermon by
Kev. E A. "Woods and short talks by wo
men engaged in missionary work. This
evening a devotional and praise service
was led by Rev. J. George Gibson and a
doctrinal sermon was delivered by Rev.
E. R. Bennett.

OAKLAND, Oct. 10.â A sensation
has been caused among the Ala
neda County politicians by the
report that Governor Gage has
in view the removal of David S. Hirsch
berg, Superintendent of the Preston
School of Industry at lone. Superintend
ent Hirschberg is an Alameda County
Democrat of much prominence, both po
litically and in business affairs. For many
years he was grand recorder of the An
cient Order of United "Workmen and in
that position attained a wide acquaintance
and popularity throughout the State.
Three years ago Governor Budd selected
him for the position as head of the lone
school for wayward boys, and his appoint
ment was made by the trustees in accord
ance with the Governor's wish.
That Superintendent Hirschberg"s posi
tion is threatened Is evidenced by recent
unexpected developments pointing toward
the fact that Governor Gage has decided
on his successor.
Within a short time there has been cir
culated in this city a petition to the Gov
ernor urging the appointment to the su
perlntendency of Rev. C. B. Riddick, pre
siding elder of the San Francisco district
of the Methodist church South, a resident
of Oakland and one of the most promi
nent of the older clergymen in California.
This petition was placed in circulation
without the knowledge of Dr. Riddick, and
it was signed by a large number of the
leading clergymen of Alameda County.
It also bears the approving signatures of
several active and prominent Republicans,
who are credited with having close rela
tions with Governor Gage.
The document is now In the hands of the
Governor. It is reported upon good au
thority that the chief executive asked for
the Indorsement of Dr. Riddick.
There is a peculiar coincidence In the
fact that Dr. Riddick's name has been so
prominently mentioned in this connection
and the further well known intimate per
sonal relations which for many years
have existed between Governor Gage and
the distinguished divine. For years they
were neighbors at Los Angeles, and dur
ing their Southern California intimacy be-
came very closely attached to each other.
As to the possibility of his being ap
pointed Superintendent of the lone school
Dr. Riddick is for the present, at least,
silent. He says he believes the rumors
sprang from a possibly overheard conver
sation he had a short time ago on a train
while traveling with the Governor.
Dr. Riddlek was last Monday reappolnt
ed presiding elder of the district of which
he has had charge for two years. He has
peculiar qualifications for executive work,
having had lonp experience, both In the
pulpit and In the school room. He is ac
counted of marked mental equipment, and
in his church occupies a strong position.
Whether Dr. Riddick will accept the
superintendency if a vacancy shall be cre
ated is a subject he will not discuss. Even
among his close associates in the church
who have been apprised of the situation,
the clergyman is dumb on that topic. It
excited much Interest during the recent
Pacific conference, which was concluded
here this week. Many delegates were
given to understand that Dr. Riddick
would shortly retire from his church field
of activity to take the position upon the
Governor's earnest solicitation.

Mayor Snow has determined to prevent
a deScit in tne ciiy's funds this year, and
to relieve the administration which will
succeed this one next April from the em
barrassmenta of starting with an empty
t reasury.
A careful survey of the situation has
convinced city officials that the most
economical conduct in the matter of ex
penditures must be enforced to prevent
hnjLxida.1 distress, ilie income from tax
ation is tar from adequate to meet th>
carefully pruned maintenance budget. >r he
Finance Committee of. the City Council,
headed by Chairman Frank K. Mott,
hewed closely to the line ujm.ti theue esti
mates, omitting all items that could be
considered luxuries in the Fhape of park
and boulevard improvements.
Despite this attitude of tlie committee,
however, there was a determined effort
made by an opposition led by Councilman
Stetson and Rowe to increase the levy for
park purposes. This attempt was beaten
and the city is n>iu- upon the $1 bas's.
No additional taxation could have been
permitted for maintenance, and the park
fund could havo only added to the tax
rate without giving a dollar of revenue
more for the actual municipal operating
expenses.
Now that the situation Is clearly defined
the Mayor has commenced his preliminary
campaign to Maze the way out of the for
est of financial darkness. To the end that
proper information may be at the disposal
of ever}' department Mayor Snow has re
quested City Auditor Breed to furnish an
estimate of the probable tmal income of

The fight between the Board of Super
visors and County Clerk Jordan as to
who should have the privilege of con
tracting for the regular election supplies
has resulted in a victory for the Supervis
ors. The board will provide for the print
ing of the indexes of the names of voters
and the sample ballots and purchase all
the supplies with which to conduct tho
polling of votes.
County Clerk Jordan made a hard fight
to secure the patronage, but to-day's ses
sion of the Board of Supervisors settled
his chances, for good. His duty will be
simply to see that the certificates of
registration on tile in his office are proper
ly bound. In this work he will take
material furnished by the Supervisors
and have the. binding done according to
the State election laws.
Before proceeding In the matter of elec
tion printing and supplies, the board
asked the artvk-e of District Attorney J.
J. Allen. The District Attorney stated
that in his opinion it was the duty of the
County ClerK simply to bind the regis
tration certificates. The State law, he
thought, did not contemplate any addi
tional expense other than the money ex
pended for necessary materials. All
printing necessary tor an election should
be contracted for by the Board of Super
visors.
Supervisor W. H. Church introduced a
resolution providing for the printing of
the certificate Indexes at the rate of fif
teen cents per name and description of
each voter. The resolution was passed
without a dissenting voice.
The contract for the printing was not
awarded but probably will be at a meet

President J. H. T. Watkinson of the
Contra Costa Water Company was not In
contempt of court when he destroyed the
corporation's books of account. Thla was
the decision this morning of Judge E. C.
Hart on Robert Y. Hayne's motion to
have Watkinson declared a violator of the
orders of the court.
The court in making the ruling stated
the company could produce evidence as
to Its property notwithstanding the burn
ing of the books containing the records of
the company prior to May, 1399.
"The city of Oakland has not shown
that this plaintiff corporation destroyed
its books after being ordered to open
them for Inspection," said the court.
"The burden of proof was upon the city
to show that there was a refusal upon
the part of the company to allow the
booka to be seen, and this allegation has
not been proved.
"According to the testimony, when Ex
perts "Van Bokkelen and Crandall made a
demand on behalf of the city to see the
accounts Mr. "YVatkinson Informed them
that the books of record up to May, 1S99,
had been burned. It was also shown that
in the absence of the books the experts
were offered a map book showing the
property owned by the company. Mr.
Van Bokkelen testified that there was no
book from which more information could
have been obtained concerning the Prop
erty of the water company than from this
map book. .
"I do not think that It has been shown
that the destruction of the books took
place after "the company had been direct
ed to allow the city to see its books, and
furthermore, I am of the opinion that evi
dence as to the cost of the company s
property would be proper evidence In this
case anyway. I think that when a ques
tion like this is raised there should be a
clear showing that the records were de
stroyed for a fraudulent purpose, I do
not think such a showing has been made,
and there are therefore no grounds for
holding Mr. Watkinson for contempt.
"The plaintiff may be allowed to pro
duce testimony as to the property owned
by it." . ,
The rest of the day was consumed in
the examination of President Watkinson.
He was questioned exhaustively regard
ing the company's property, and at the
hour of adjournment this afternoon was
still on the stand. Several days may be
consumed in taking Mr. "VVatkinson'a tes
timony.
A number of deeds from various per
sons to the water' company were offered
in evidence for the corporation by Attor
ney McCutchen. The deeds covered the
transfers of pieces of land in different
parts of the county, and President Wat
kinson was asked to state for Just what
! purposes the property was used. The
witness explained the uses of the reser
voirs at San Leandro and Temescal and
the pipe lines leading from these great
storage places of water.
Considerable argument was occasioned
by the several attempts of the water
company's counsel to obtain from Wat
kinson his opinion as to the necessity of
portions of the corporation's plant. Mr.
Hayne objected to this course of ques
tioning on the ground that it had not been
shown that the witness was an expert.
In reply Mr. McCutchen claimed Mr.
Watkinson was qualified to testify as* an
expert, as he had served the water com
pany in almost every capacity from clerk
to general manager. If any one was fa
miliar with the needs of the water com
pany he thought the witness was.
"Why were the filters at San Leandro
built at the time the project to build the
East Oakland reservoir was abandoned?"
asked Mr. McCutchen.
"Because the company was forced to
put in the filters by the City Council,
which decided that the proposed settling
reservoir In East Oakland would be use
less." was the reply..
Watkinson explained the purposes of
the larjre tracts of land owned by the
company at Pleasanton. after which the
court adjourned until to-morrow morning
at 10 o'clock.

GRAPE-NUTS.
ATHLETE'S FAILURE.
Wafi'Not a Success Until He Was Put
on the Right Food.
Cecelius X. Hale of 1717 Barclay St..
Baltimore, Md.. now quite a famous
runner, has had some interestine expe-
rience in regard to proper feeding. His
testimony is worth the attention of any
athlete, or, in fact, of any person who
cares for good, sturdy, powerful health.
'Up to about 18 months aco I had
been in many athletic contests, without
much success. I about made uq my
mind it was time to fctop. but a physical
director of the Y. M. C. A. of this citv
advised me to use Grape-Nuts food and
Postum Cereal Coffee as principal fac-
tors in my diet.
"I accepted the advice and to-day am
in possession of periY-ct health, and 1
great many medals won in different ath-
letic events. I can now run a race and
finish in fine condition, whereas before I
started on the right diet I would find
myself in a faint at the end of a race.
"Formerly I. had more or less nervous
trouble and severe headaches. I am
glad to say since using: Grape-Nuts and
Postum Food Coffee I have fonjottefi
what a headache feels like. Mv heart is
in perfect condition, whereas while I was
using ordinary coffee it would not stand
the heavy strain. This statement is ab-
solutely true, and I do not object to
your publishing it. for it mav brine back
health ard strenjjth to some poo r beinqr
suffering: from ill health caused bv the
u<e of improper food."
There is a reason for this. In the first
place, ordinary coffee will show its Â«*f-
fects somewhere in the nervous system â
frequently in weakening of the heart or
in stomach troubles, which prevents one
from obtaining the strenpth and value of
food. It is therefore ncessarv to quit
the use of this drug and in its place use
Postum Cereal Food Coffee and Grape-
-vuts food.
They were both invented bv a forvj
expert and are made at the famous pure
food factories of the Postum Cereal Co .
Ltd.. at Rattle Creek. Mich. This food
and the food, drink are both m^de for a I
definite purpose, and there are thou-
sands of users throughout the world that
can testify, from practical experience.
that the theory is borne out by the facts.THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 11, 1900.

Forrest Wishes to Be Relieved.
PERTH,. West Australia, Oct. 10.â The)
Premier, the Right Hon. Sir John Forrest,
in introducing the budget to-day asked to
be relieved of the Premiership early in
1901. Reviewing the satisfactory condi
tion of the colony, the Premier said It
was intended to make Fremantle the San
Francisco of Australia. He added that
the profits of the State railroads were
sufficient to pay 4 . per cent on the debt
and provide 1 per cent for the sinking
fÂ«nd. Â¦ - Â¦ Â¦ Â« Â¦ Â¦â¢ -
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 10.â The ninetv-first an
nual meeting of the American Board of
Commissioners for Foreign Mission:* con
vened this mcrning in Pilgrim Congrega
tional Church and will be in session three
days. Between two and three hundred
corporate" members, ofticers of the Ameri
can Board and the women's auxiliaries,
missionaries from foreign and homo
fields, as well as prominent ministers and'
laymen from many Congregational
churches were present. Rev. Dr. Michael
Burnham, pastor of Pilgrim Congrega
tional Church, delivered a short address
of welcome, and a fitting response to his
eloquent remarks was made by Samuel
B. Capen, L.L. D., of Boston, president
of the American Board, who said in part: i
"There will be two thoughts constantly
before us all through these meetings. Tbo
nrst Is that it Is me closing year of the
century, which will be known in history
as the great missionary century J
"And the second thought will be the
fearful story from China. Never before
have we held our meetings under such a,
shadow. We remember noble men and
women from our tiresides who wear the
martyr's crown; we remember the native
Christians, who have not hesitated to
show their fidelity by shedding tneir life
blocd, and our prayers will go out to the
home friends whose hearts are bleeding
and torn. Nineteen years ago in this city
the Shansi mission was inaugurated; this
year It has been practlcaily exterminated
in awful massacre."
The report of the prudential committee,
home department, stated that death had
claimed from the ranks of the corporate
body ten of Its members, whose services
have ranged from 1851 to 1S93.
During the year forty new missionaries
have been sent to their several fields of
appointmentâ eleven men, three of whom
ara physicians, and twenty-nine ladles,
twelve the wives of missionaries and two
of them physicians.
It is expected that at the coming session
of Congress a bill will be introduced in
cluding among other features the repeal
of the legacy tax to Institutions of a lit
erary, educational or charitable character.
During the past year there has been a re
bate in rent to the Congregational mis
sionary societies from, the Congregational
house income of $1124.
In addition to the missionaries assigned
under the auspices of the forward move
ment committee, some twenty-two mis
sionaries, or missionary families, have
been assigned through other agencies. In
two cases missionary families have been
taken by individuals; in two cases by En
deavor societies grouped for the purpose;
in two cases by churches grouped, and in
the other cases by individual churches.
The report of the treasurer, Frank H. !
Wiggin of Boston, showed that in ex
penditures the cost of missions had been
$076,165; the cost of agencies. $17,119; the
cost of publications, $9304; the cost of ad
ministration, $29,461; balance for which the
board was In debt September 1. 1S99. Ji8,

At the afternoon session the annual
survey of the work of the American
Board was presented In a report read by !
Rev. Dr. James L. Barton, one of the sec- |
retarles. It dwelt r.t length on the work ;
being done in the Pacific islands, Africa, i
Turkey and China especially.

YEAR'S WORK IN
MISSION FIELD
Sixto Lopez's telegram was called forth
by a query sent to him by Mr. Ehrich as
to the authenticity of the alleged procla
xnation.-' Â¦--- Â¦Â¦â¢ Â¦Â¦<Â¦
"The proclamation to which you refer
Is a clumsy forgery, which can only be
believed by bitter opponents. It Is the
work, no doubt, of the Spaniards or the
monks, who try to create ill feeling be
tween the Americans and the Filipinos to
the discredit of the latter. No such dis
graceful or diabolical proclamation was
ever Issued by Aguinaldo."
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.. Oct. 10.â
Louis R. Ehrich, a member of the Na
tional Executive Committee of the Anti-
Imperiallst League, to-day received a tel
egram from Sixto Lopez In Boston, one
of the foremost Filipinos and a man who
stands near Aguinaldo, denying emphatic
ally the authenticity of the proclamation
purporting to have been. issued by Agui
naldo January 9, 1S99. in which the Phil
ippine leader Instructed his followers to
occupy the housetops along the line which
the American soldiers should follow in
entering Manila and urging them to pour
oil and boiling water on the soldiers. The
alleged instructions further Incited tho
Filipinos to use spears which would leave
the head of the weapon in the body of the
victim when the shaft was withdrawn,
and urged other and varied forms of tor
ture of the American soldiers. Lopez's
telegram is addressed to Mr. Ehrich and
reads:
"BOSTON, Mass.. Oct 9. 1900.
Proclamation by Aguinaldo.
Sixto Lopez's Views on an Alleged
Colonel Hood, Sixteenth Infantry, ac
companied by Captain Moody, has re
turned from Abulug and reports that
everywhere was manifested the greatest
loyalty and enthusiasm. The colonel Is
well pleased with the conduct of affairs
at Abulug and vicinity.
DENOTJWCED AS A FOBGERY.
Small bands of Ladrones are commit
ting depredations in many sections' of the
archipelago. Lieutenant Colonel Byram
of the Twenty-seventh Infantry raided
Santalon, a small pueblo lying 1 between
Tavtay and Maraquina, last Wednesday
at midnight and captured forty-eight La
drones. This capture winds un a bunch
of water pir;ttcÂ» that has infested the
mouth of the lake and the marshes in tho
vicinity.
A band of Ladrones recently visited tha
home of an old Spaniard, living about
twenty miles from Masbate, and mur
dered the entire family, whicn consisted
Of father and mother, six sons and six
daughters. The terrible wholesale butch
ery was reported to the commander of the
Masbate post and a detachment of the
Twenty-ninth was sent to capture the
bandits. A hot fight ensued, which re
sulted in fifteen dead rebels and the cap
ture of eight rifles. The Americans suf
fered no casualties.
Two horsethieves and deserters from
the Twenty-ninth Infantry, U. S. V., sta
tioned on the island of Masbate, were
killed by a party of soldiers who were
sent to capture them. As the little party
approached the deserters the latter opened
an Ineffective lire, which was returned,
and the two deserters fell dead. One of
them was named Carxan, but the name
of his companion has not been learned.
Two other soldiers who were intimidated
Into joining the deserters made their es
cape and returned to camp.
A claim has just been presented to the
secretary of the Military Governor Ly
Ssnor Manuel Pardo for the recovery of
the sum of $32,000 from the United Staias
Government for the seizure and confisca
tion and ' sale of the steamer Toning,
which was seized by the United States
authorities In January, 1S99, condemned as
a nlibusterer and sold to the McLeod
Company for 532.000. Senor Pardo claims
that the Government officials were de
ceived by false testimony. He says he
can show that his steamer never carried
nor transported any arms, and that at all
times he has been friendly to the United
States Government. The claimant only
asks for the sum the steamer sold for, <o
the Government will not lose anything In
the event ot the claim being allowed.
"Word has been received from San.
Miguel to the effect that two men belong
ing to Lieutenant Alsladtter's party -were
given their liberty on parole a few days
ago. They report that the lieutenant and
the other prisoners are now in the hards
of Pablo Tecson and Â¦ are well cared for.
Fagan, the deserter from the Twenty
fourth Infantry, is supposed to have
planned the ambush. The treatment of
prisoners by Tecson has been most com
mendable, and all the reports brought
from within his line indicate that Pablo
is most humane In his methods. The two
men who were given their parole were re
quired to sign a paper, written In Spanish,
the full Import of which they did not
know, but which they understood to be a
sort of parole.
MANILA, Aug. 24.â Colonel Freeman,
commanding: the Twenty-fourth Infantry,
has just completed some very Important
work at San Nicolas. , On. August 12 he
received the surrender of one colonel, one
major, six captains, seven lieutenants, 150
men, 101 rllies, 800 rounds of ammunition
and 50 bolosâ all that was left of Colonel
Roberto Grassa's force with that veteran
at its head. Grassa's surrender with his
battle-worn command is another vital
blow to the hopes and ambitions of Agul
naldo. It removes an important prop
from his cause and will go far toward the
complete restoration of peace in Luzon.
Senor Manuel Pardo Seeks to Recover
the Amount Received From the
Sale of the Steamer
Toning.
Capture of Grassa's Force
Will Do Much Toward
Restoring Peace.

Assembly arid James "WUkins is the nomi
nee of the party for State Senator. Mr.
Wilklns was practically forced into the
contest because the Southern Pacific Com
pany wanted a well known and popular
candidate to run against Charles M. Bel
shaw. whose legislative career ls not
commended by the railroad. When ques
tions came before the Legislature involv
ing the interests of the people on one
side and the desires of. the corporation
on the other, Mr. Belshaw deemed it his
duty to speak and vote for the people.
The agents of the company's political
bureau fancied that Mr. Belshaw should
have divided his attentionsâ that a speech
for the - people and a I vote for. the road
would have been a fair division. As Mr.
Belshaw went on record every time'as the
representative of the people In the As
sembly the corporation apprehends that
he will adhere- to the same line of con
duct In the Senate, hence a special ef
fort ls put forward to elect "his opponent-
Mr. Wilkins.
Agents of the railroad In their zeal to
help Mr. Wliklns fancied that- a point
could be gained In Marin County, by knif
ing J. Emmet. Hayden, the Democratic
candidate for 1 the :, Assembly. The knif
ing ls in progress, but <the friends of Mr.
"Wilkins assert that he Is not concerned
in the raid against a fellow Democrat on
the legislative ticket. : It Is asserted .that
Mr. Wilkins has protested-: against' the
double dealing, and distinctly announced
that he would rather be defeated -than
. secure an election by unfair means. 1
Friends of Mr. Hayden are not satisfied*
with . the explanation and threaten to
make reprisals by voting for Mr., Belshaw.
They claim that they have positive proof
that leaders In the flght\forrMr. ,wfiklns
are secretly plotting against Mr. Hayden;
Mr. Belshaw is meanwhile . making a an
energetic canvass of the Senatorial Tdis
trlct and the Indications are that he will
receive a substantial majority. ., Â¦

VACANCY IN THE OFFICE
OF COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS
If a tall, slim young man with a dark
complexion and wearing clothes that
match it calls at your residence and
asks leave to examine your gas me
ter beware of him. He has about aa
much interest in your meter as the aver
age householder has in the moon.
This mysterious individual has been
making the rounds in the residence dis
tricts for the purpose of appropriating
valuables, or laying plans for a future
surreptitious visit. The police believe he
is a burglar and are keeping a very sharp
lookout for him. The housewife who im
agines him to be a gas inspector and ad
mits him "into her home regrets it. He
usually repays her hospitality by taking
a gold or siiver token as a memento of
his visit. If he don't take anything It if
because he is watched too closely.
The Police Â¦ Department has recently
heard of the stranger's peculiar method
and is making every effort to become
better acaualnted with him. He Is a
bashful Inspector and refuses. to be Intro
duced to any of Chief Sullivan's handy
men. *
The bogus inspector visited the home of
Mrs. J. C. Murphy, 1S24B Howard street.
yesterday and that lady conferred a ben
efit on the department by Instantly report
ing his visit to an officer. The alleged in
spector suavely- asked Mrs. Murphy
whether she had much trouble with the
gas meter. Receiving a negative answer
the polite crook asked If she was being
charged too much for gas and Mrs. Mur
phy, like a thrifty housewife, imagined
she was and admitted the fact to her
questioner.
"Well, I think I can fix things for you
If you let me go upstairs,"' he replied.
and before the surprised woman could de
mur he was half way up the flight. She
was naturally suspicious of her visitor
and watched him closely. After he had
made a casual examination of the meter
and departed she notified the policeman
on the beat about her visitor. Like a du
tiful officer he reported the occurrence
to his superiors and as his description tal
lied with that of the stranger already re
ported at headauarters the entire force
was ordered to keep a sharp lookout for
him. Â»
THE police are looking for a mis
creant who repaid hospitality with
robbery. Mrs. Antonette Swanson.
who resides at 790 Pennsylvania
avenue, Potrerc. was the victim,
and she reported the robbery to the po
lice a half hour after it happened.
According to the story told by Mrs.
Swanson she was engaged in washing
dishes in the Dantry about 8:30 o'clock
yesterday morning when she heard some
one at the door, and upon lopklng around
discovered a thick-set man of the tramp
species. The fellow abjectly begged for
something to eat and the woman was
either afraid to refuse his appeal or out
of sympathy granted it. She invited him
into the kitchen and food before him.
He ate heartily and asked for a second
cup of coffee, which he hastily swal
lowed.
The sca'mp evidently knew that Mrs.
Swanson was alone in the house, and
when he arose from the table, instead of
thanking her for her kindness he roughly
demanded money. She replied that she had
none and he threateningly answered that
she had or should have some in the
house.
Mrs. Swanson was so frightened that
she was unable to cry out for help. Sh<?
either fainted from fear or the scoundrel
struck her. When she regained conscious
ness a half hour later she found a nap
kin stuffed in her mouth and her pockets
turned inside out.
Weak with fear she staggered over to
a neighbor's house and told what had
happened. An examination of her rooms
disclosed that the fellow had opened up
bureau drawers and ransacked trunks in
his search for valuables. The police were
Immediately notified and are now dili
gently searching, for an Italian five feet
six inches In height, who wears a stubby
mustache, speaks broken English and ls
about 30 years old. He has a low fore
head and is rather stout. The ruffian
wore a short sack coat, greasy trousers
and a woolen shirt.
Mrs. Swanson told Detective Cody, who
was detailed on the case by Captain of
Detectives Seymour, that she had $20 in
the house concealed in a closet, but the
brutal robber failed to get it.
Â¦rttb hardly a. dollar; and just what part
she will play in the litigation is what is
:<-iw claiming the attention of the law
yers. She Is a. Madame L. Le Bachalle,
and she keeps a :odging-!iouse at 630 Clay
Hreet. which was established for her by
Her.arie before he died.
It has been charged that Henarie had
for his mistress the first wife of Louis
Radgetky, and this was the basis of a
suit for divorce, afterward dropped,
brought by Ivlrs. Henarie ten or twelve
years ago. but it was not known except
by a very few, liadgesky among the num
ber, that there was another woman as
veil. Madame I/e Bachalle, when she
:irst met Henarie. was the wife of a
Vrench nobleman who came out hore to
*r,gage in the banking business, but fail
ing, look to mining instead. He failed in
the mines also, and returned home, leav
ing his young Â¦wife at the Orleans Hotel
In Sacramento, then kept by Henarie. 1:
wa? his intention to send for his wife as
soon as he was able, but before he did so
she becajne Infatuated with Henarie and
decided to remain with him. This Â¦was
in the early fifties. A child was born to
them, but it died when but five days old.
She was a Catholic, and being unable to
secure a divorce from her husband she
could not marry Her.arie, so the two lived
together without the law's sanction until
in 1&54 Henarie met and married Mrs.
Hosley. the present claimant for v
widow's share of the estate. His relations
with Madame Le Bachalle did not stop
then, however, nor after, and up to the
time of hi? death Henarie paid her regu
larly a monthly allowance. She had
loaned him some money after a fire in
Sacramrnto which destroyed his hotel
and this she claims was never paid back.
Besides, she says, before Henarie died he
told her he had put $30j0 in an envelope
and had left it in his safe, and this was
to be given to her after his death. It
was her demand for this J30JO thill
brought her s=tory to ligbt.
For some raonins after Henarie's death
Radgesky paid the woman the usual al
lowance. but he was pusper.ded as an ex
ecutor of the Henarie estate three. months
ago, and he then refused to pay anything
more to Madame Le Bachalle. She sought
to force the payment and also to secure
possession of the JSOJO she was sure Hena
rie had left for her. Falling in this she
made herself known to the attorneys in
the case and to Mrs. Henarie, the widow.
During all the years Henarie â¢was living
with this woman, and with others, he kept
the secret from his own wife. He was in
constant dread les-t his wife should hear
of his liaison with the French woman.
and he warned the latter that ehe must
rifver compromise him in any way. He
told her that he could not leave her any
thing in his will because it would cause a
ecandal and all he could do for her was
to leave the envelope with the $3000 for
her. He established her in the lodging
house she now keeps and he was friendly
with her up to the time of his death, but
he never spoke of her and was never seen
with her. Even the employes of his office,
who suspected that something of the kind
was going on. never saw or knew of
Madame Le Bachalle. For rw**rly fifty
years ehe was his paramour, and in all
that time Radgesky was the only pae who
kiww positively of the relationship.
Madame Le Bachalle Is 73 years old.
She has nothing to suport her but the
precarious income from her lodging
house and row that her allowance has
been stopped ehe is In more desperate
Ftraits than ever. She has no legal cause
of action for any of the estate, unless she
can make one on the money she lent Hen
arie far back In the fifties.
To the widow her appearance is an
added sting. For thirty years she lived
happily with H?narie. knowing nothing of
the French woman, and the woman's ap
pearance now robs the memory of those
years of all Jts worth.
Mrs. Henarie is an invalid. For seven
teen years she has lain helpless upon her
back, paralyzed, and the struggle she Is
making tc .Â«ave her share of her hus
band's rstate for her daughter is the last
the will ever make. She has not much to
look back upon, but her married life was
one bright spot in her memory. She finds
now it was all a Fham.
There Is another woman in the Her.arie
case; one that for years Jived with the
eld capitalist and at his death was left
She Was the Wife of a French Noble
man and Met the Hotel
Man in the Fif
ties.
Evidence of the Dual Life

ANOTHER WOMAN
APPEARS IN THE
HENARIE CASE
The bids for the new drydock at Hun
ters Point were opened last Tuesday and
so far the City Street Improvement Com
pany has proved to be the lowest bidder.
There were eleven bids, the lowest being
$40:1,000 and the highest $450,000. Each con
tractor put in a number of bids, offering
to do the work if certain different kinds
of machinery was used, at different
prices. The next bid to that of the City
Street' Improvement Company was that
of the San Francisco Bridge Company,
J40S.OOO.
Besides these wharves, two new ferry
slips are to be built on the north side of
Lombard-street wharf. These are to be
fitted with hydraulic hoisting gear and
everything about' them will bo modern.
All in all this will be one of the biggest
contracts ever entered into by the Har
bor Commission. The sum involved will
be in the neighborhood of $400,000 and
every cent of it will come out of the rev
enue of the board and rjot a cent from
the general taxpayer.
The commission has decided to build
four new wharves between Union and
Lombard streets. These are to be the
finest kind of structures and will carry
500 pounds to the square inch, whereas
the present wharves can only carry 300
pounds.
The Harbor Commissioners held one of
the most Important meetings in the his
tory of the board yesterday. When the
new ferry depot was talked about a
special act of the Legislature had to be
procured before the work could proceed.
Yesterday Commissioners Kllburn, Har
ney and Herold undertook a work of
almost equal magnitude. There was no
red tape about it and there will be no is
suing of bonds in order to carry out the
project. This Is made possible by an act
passed last year which enables the board
to anticipate five years' revenue. .
