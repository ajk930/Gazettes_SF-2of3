The Call accuses E. T. Cosper, candidate for Superior
Judge in Kings County, of extorting money while a mem
ber of the Legislature from an attache of that body.
â¢ Cosper evades but does not deny the charge. He knows that proof of his guilt can be produced, and, wants the contro
versy deferred until after the election. ' * Â¦
The Call is prepared to prove by the testimony of three menâ one a member of the 'Legislature.- another a. reputable
newspaper man and the third a responsible and well-known : citizenâ that .Cosper did obtain $30 by extortion.
The man from whom the money .was taken only had . $100. Cosper demanded $40, but finally consented to take $30. When
witnesses to the transaction unexpectedly appeared on the scene; much to the surprise of Cosper. he exclaimed:
"Gentlemen, what does this mean?" Â¦' . / SSS&EEB&BIKiifl
Cosper had sufficient presence of mind to hold on to the thirtyâ the same number that Judas received.

CALL BUREAU, WELLINGTON
EOTEX, WASHINGTON, Oct 25.â
According to a Census Bureau bulle
tin issued to-day Nebraska, is the
only State in which the combined
population of the cities contained
therein shows a decrease from 1S90
to 1900.
m The belletin summarizes the returns of
r.-ie population of cities having 25.000 In
habitants or mere In 1900, the Individual
census o* each of these cities having been
eSScially announced heretofore. There are
253 of these and the bulletin shows that
the percentage of increase in their popu
lation from 1S30 to lÂ£>0 was 22.5. as against
<3.5 for the stae cities in the previous de
cade. The absolute Increase In the popu
lation of these cities from 1S30 to 1200 was !
4.S29.135. or 62.C6 less than the abaclute
Increase from 1SS0 to 1S33. when it was
4.S21.562. The 153 cities combined have a
population, la 1500. of 13.604,63. against
lt.E55.4S3 In 1B30 and S.S33.S27 In 1SS0. Of the j
1Z9 cities. divided into four classes. IS had
200,000 and over; nineteen had 100,000 and
u.Tler 200,000; forty had 50,000 end under
10\O00 and eighty-one had 25,000 and under
R.ooo.
la 18S0 there were but twenty cities
which contained more than 100,000 inhabit
ants, but in 1S30 this number had Increased
to twenty-eight. *nd In 1900 to thirty
Â«?*Kht.
The nineteen cities of. the Â¦ first class
comprise New York, which, with more
than 8.000,000 Inhabitants, properly stands
by itself, two cities, Chicago and Phlla-
Celphia, each of which has a population
in excess of a million: three cities', St.
Tx>uis, Boston and Baltimore, which have |
a population of half a million each: five
cities. Cleveland, Buffalo. San Francisco.
Cincinnati and Pittsburg. which have a
population of between 200,000 and 400,000
each, and eight cities. Xew Orleans, De
troit, Milwaukee. Washington. Newark,
Jersey City. Louisville and Minneapolis,
â¢which have a population of between 200.030
end 200,000 each.
New York, undÂ»r the act of consolida
tion, which became effective January 1,
1SDS, has gTown to be a city of nearly
2,500.000 Inhabitants in 1900. as compared
with *Â¦ population for what was formerly j
New York City of a little more than
1.300,000 In 1850 and substantially 1,200.000 in
1SS3. The population of the territory now j
comprised within the present limits of i
New York waÂ» approximately 2,500,000 in j
ISM. and 1,000,000 In l e S0. It is the premier
city of the country in point of population,
a position "which It ha* uniformly held at
each decennial census since and includ
ing 1790.
Chicago, with practically 1.700.000 inhab
itants, and Philadelphia, with not quite
3.330.000 inhabitants, hold the second and
third places in 1900. the same as in 1SS0,
although at the census of 1SS0 their posi
tions were re\-ersed. Philadelphia then
having nearly Â£Â£0.000 Inhabitants, as com
pared with not much more than 500.000 for
Chicago.
' Among the raost notable changes in the
rank of cities which have taken place in !
i:O0, as compared with 1SS0, may be men
tioned that of Seattle, which has advanced
from the 150th to the 14Sth place; Los An
freles. from the 135th to the thirty-sixth
place: Duluth. from the 15Gth to the sev
enty-second place: Kansas City, from the
1ZM to the seventy-sixth place, and Port
land, Or., from the 106th to the forty
tccond. Other noticeable changes In rank
from 1SS0 to 1300 are Tacoma, from 155th to
IOd. and Spokane, from 157th to 105th.
The following-named States and Terri
tf-ries in ISO0 do not contain any city with
a population of 25.000 or more: Arizona,
Idaho. Indian Territory. Mississippi. Ne
vada, New Mexico. North Carolina, North
Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and
Wyoming.
Massachusetts has the largest number
of euch cities, namely, twenty, and is fol-
Icwed by Pennsylvania with eighteen and
New York with twelve."
The most eigmiflcant growth of cities
is that for the cities in the State of Wasb
l:igton. namely Seattle. Spokane and Ta
coma. These three cities combined had
only <DS1 inhabitants in 1SS0. but their pop
ulation had Increased to SS.765 In 1S90 and
to 155.223 in 1M0, the increase during the
past decade being equivalent to 57.1 per
cent.^ - . '
Of the total population represented by
the 153 cities in 1900 (19^93.625) 10.90S.6aâ¬. or
U.J per cent, is contained in the seventy
cities situated In the North" Atlantic /di
|Â£Ulon and 6.071.861, or 30.8 per cent, in the
imy-eight cities situated in the North
Central division, leaving 'only 3,524.068, or
17.* per cent, for the remaining cities siu
wated in the other three geographical di
visions.
SYRACUSE, N. T., Oct. 23.â The closing
speeches of an arduous day in Governor
Roosevelt's campaign were made at Au
burn and Syracuse, after jumps through
widely divergent counties. Although it
was a favorable day, because while in Au
burn and Syracuse there were several in
terruptions, the questions and answers
were rather In a good natured form and
there was no friction which indicated a
desire on the part of either questioner or
answerer to enter into a personal contro
versy.
Syracuse Itself was a blaze of light,
while hundreds of people thronged the
streets. The auditorium where the
speechmaklng was held and the square
where the outside meeting took place
were both too email to accommodate
those who desired to hear Governor
Roosevelt.
In Auburn" three meetings had to be
hpld to accommodate the people. It was
at this pl^ce that the first serious inter
ruption of the day occurred. The Gover
nor had started at the first meeting upon
an exposition of the trust question.
During his remarks a man In the upper
gallery cried out, "Hurrah for Bryan'." ;
"Why?" retorted the Governor, squar
ing himself toward the place whence the
cry came and pausing for a reply, which
was not made.
"He docs not know," said the Governor,
smiling; "It means just about that grade
of intelligence."
The Governor said, referring to the
question of expansion:
"In this city Mr. Bryan actually dared
to appeal to the memory of Seward;- I
wonder, well, I don't wonder at Mr. Bry
an, but under any other conditions I
should wonder at any man making that
appeal and forgetting that one of the
greatest services that Mr. Se ward ren
j dered to this country was that under his
guidance this country expanded over,
Alaska, and it expanded Without the con
sent of the governed there" ,
"How about Metcalf ?" came an inter
ruption.
"Metcalf," said the Governor in a puz
zled way.
Then remembering that Mr. Metcalf
was president of the D. M. Osborne ma
chine shops, and had threatened to shut
down if Mr. Bryan was elected, he said:
"Metcalf is all right. If Mr. Bryan was
half as right he would be fortunate."
"How about the canals?" came from the
gallery before the Governor could' pro
ceed.
"I will answer you once for all," said
the Governor. "Do you mean In this i
Stater*
"Yes," came the reply back.
"I answer," , said" the Governor, "that
they are administered with absolute hon
esty and efficiency, as you know If you ;
know anything about them."
At Syracuse the Governor was first driv
en to a etand erected on ,the square in
front of the Welting Opera-house, in
which he was to speak later. The crowd I
was so dense that It was only with the !
utmost difficulty the police could open a
way sufficiently wide for . his carriage - to
pass through. When the Governor got on
the stand the crowd surged up against It
with Irresistible force,, and .it was. not
until the. Governor himself 'induced those
in the rear to crowd the other way. that
the crush was somewhat abated.
The Governor's party and < . the police
.then formed themselves, into jwhmf a foot
ball player would call a'flylng wedge," and
succeeded in reaching the halL
nicer meeting than this in my life." This
la what Mr. Bryan said to a number of
the Princeton boys who followed him from
his train at his meeting place at Princeton
Junction this afternoon. He arrived at
the junction at 5:30 o'clock and spoke
from a slightly raised stand on the green
In the rear of the railroad station. In
cluded in the audience were from 1000 to
1500 of the students of Princeton College,
which institution is located three miles
distant from the junction. The meeting
was one of the most orderly that Mr.
Bryan has had in his whole campaign
tour. There was not an interruption from
beginning to. end. When Mr. Bryan ar
rived he was greeted by the college yell
and there was a similar demonstration
upon his departure. His address there
was entirely to the students. He said:
"I want you to consider that in this na
tion monopoly exists, and that It is rap-
Idly approaching- an industrial despotism.
I' want you to consider whether it Is well
for a^free government to have Its indus
tries, collected Under the management of
a few men, so that the rest of the people
will receive their daily bread at the hands
! of these few. ; Many of you are preparing
yourselves â¢ for the legal profession, but
you will find under the system of monop
' olythat the law business of the country
will gravitate toward the offices of the
great corporation attorneys, while the rest
! of the lawyers will be law clerks in the
i offices of those attorneys. Tou will flad
that as monopoly increases the chance of
the young man becomes less, and, when
you take away the hope that has Inspired
him in the past you render him' a less ef
fective man. This nation is the greatest
nation in the world, because here there Is
more hope for the young man; here life is
before the young men. There is no class
distinction; there is no caste. In this
country the son of the humblest citizen
may aspire to. the highest rewards In the
industrial and political world, but under
an industrial despotism you take away the
prospect of Independence, and under this
system you will find that political des
potism will : follow, for when one em
ployer can coerce .thousands of employes
and threaten them with idleness anS star
vation unless they vote the ticket tho em
ployer favors, you will find a government
ft the people, by the people and for the
people will be a thing of the past.
, "I want to call your attention also to
the system which Is now being proposed
by the Republicans known as the colonial
system. One of our great Institutions of
learning has established In the college a
department for dealing with our depend
encies and colonies. Young men. we have
never had colonies, and when we have
reached the point where we want colonies
we have reached the point 'where we do
not have a republic You cannot have one
idea here and another idea in the Orient.
Governments cannot come .up from the
people here, and in the Philippine Islands
come out of the mouth of the cannon."

I"in3 Workers Told to Continue tha
Battle for Their Rights and to
Demand Their Wages
HAZLETON, Pa., Oct. 25.â The fol
lowing statement was given out for
publication to-night by President
Mitchell of the United Mine Work
ers, in which the strike of miners in
the anthracite coal fields is called off:
"Temporary Headquarters. United Mine
Workers of America.
-. "HAZLETON, Pa.. Oct. 25. 1900.
"To the Miners and Mine Workers of
the Anthracite Region â Gentlemen: After
carefully canvassing the. entire strike sit
uation we, your officers, district and na
tional, have concluded that your victory
Is so nearly complete that no good end
can be derived by continuing the strike
longer. The contest has been in progress
for thirty-nine days and the companies
employing you have, with few exceptions,
signified their willingness to pay the scale
of wages formulated by the Scranton con
vention of October 12 and 13.
"We are aware that some disappoint
ment and dissatisfaction has been caused
by the failure of the operators in districts
1 and 1 . to separate the reduction in the
price of powder, from the advance In
v.-nges,' but after careful Inquiry we are
satisfied that each mine employe will
; actually receive an advance of 10 per cent
on tho wages formerly paid. In the
Schuylkill and Lehigh regions the largest
companies have agreed that the sliding
scales should be suspended and that
wages should remain stationary at 10 per
ctnt until April 1, 1301. thus removing ona
of the iniquities of which you have com
plained for many years.
""While it is true that you have not se
cured redress for all your wrongs, while
It Is true that the increase In your earn
ings will not fully compensate you for
the arduous labor you are compelled to
perform, you have established a perfect
organization, which, if maintained and
conducted on business principles, will en
able you to regulate many of your local
grievances and make your employment
less hazardous and more profitable 'than
before the strike began. The companies
ag.ree in their notices to take up with
their employes all grievances complained
of. We would, therefore, advise that
when work is resumed committees be se
lected by the mine employes and that
they wait upon the superintendent and
present their grievances in an orderly,
businesslike manner and ask that they
be corrected. â¢ "
"Tour attention is respectfully called to
the fact that the laws of the State of
Pennsylvania provide that miners should
be paid semi-monthly upon demand. We
should, therefore, advise that each mine
employe serve notice on the companies
that he expects to be paid his wages twice
each month, as provided by law.
"The practical benefits to the miners
which accrue from thorough organization
have been so clearly demonstrated during
this strike that It should be needless for
us to urge upon you the necessity of main
taining your union Intact. "We trust, how
'ever. that those who are now members of
the union will be unceasing In- their ef
forts to Induce all other mine workers to
ally Â¦ themselves with the United Mine
"Workers of America at once, as It will be
Impossible for you to secure higher wages
In the future, or even hope to maintain
the present rate of wages unless you are
prepared to offer a united resistance If
any attempt Is made to reduce your earn
ings upon the expiration of the present
offer.
"AÂ«j there are some few companies who
have neither posted, notified nor signified
in any other manner "their willingness to
pay the 10 per cent advance In'wages and
suspend the sliding scale, we would ad
vise that unless the men employed by such
companies receive notice before Monday
that the advance will be paid they remain
away from the mines and continue on
strike until the companies employing them
agree . to the condition* offered by the
otber companies. The employes of the
companies who have offered the advance
of 10 per' cent- and abolished the sliding
scale are hereby authorized to resume
work Monday morning, October 29. and to
be prepared,- If called on. to contribute a
reasonable amount of their earnings for
the maintenance .of those who may be
compelled to continue* on strike."

"What, I want to call attention to and

The Governor talked for an hour; touch

mostly on the same lines as he has spoken

WASHINGTON', Oct. 25.â Admiral
O"Neill. Chief of the Ordnance Depart
ment, received a telephonic message this
morning from the proving -ground at In
dian Head, to the effect that at about 10
o'clock last night a fire and several ex
plosions occurred in one of the filling
houses and magazines. The cause of. the
explosion is unknown at present, but an
investigation Is in progress. No other
damage was done and no one, was Injured.
This message was received from Lieuten
ant Fullinwider, who is second in com
mand at Indian Head. At the time he
sÂ«nt it Lieutenant Strauss, commandant
at the proving ground, -was on his way to
Washington on the dispatch boat Santa
Barbara, to make his report on the occur
rence directly to headquarters here. As
soon as it became known officially that
no one had been injured great relief was
expressed.
The building where the first explosion
occurred is technically known as "Cart
ridges," being a place where the brass
shells which are used in the small caliber
rajiid-fire guns are filled with powder. It
is distant about half a mile from the
wharf where the boats land and from the
point where the armor plate test occurs.
Within a hundred feet on one aide and
about 300 feet on the other, are two other
buildings, one designated -on the official
map ".Magazine" and the other- marked
"Dark." These buildings are used for
powder storage, and it is not yet positive
ly known whether they have all b,een de
stroyed or not. If they have, the loss, as
far as buildings are concerned, 1b slight.
They were constructed lightly with a view
to avoiding confinement of the powder
contents, in case of fire. Within the three
buildings were stored about fifteen tons
of brown powder and ten tons of smoke
less powder.' The latter, when not close
ly confined under pressure, is not explos
ive, but creates a vast flame, and Admiral
O'Neill said it was the nre blazing from
the smokeless powder which save rise to
the belief that a great accident- had oc
curred.
Near the powder houses stand .the resi
dences of half a dozen employes at the
proving ground, and their families. That
no one was Injured Is accounted for by the
prudence which located the magazines in
ravines, affording the protection of the
encompassing hills to' the residences in
the vicinity. The big powder factory,
representing a large expenditure of Gov
ernment money, was never In danger from
the fire and explosion. It is between two
and three miles distant in a straight Hue
from the scene of the disaster, with hills
lying between.
It is always difficult to fix the responsU
blllty in euch cases. The admiral thought
that some workman In the vicinity yes
terday may Have been careless and left
a burning cigarette . or . match, which
started a- fire that smoldered until night
fall, when It communicated with some
powder. On the other hand there always
is a possibility, which naval officers do not
like to recognize, of some chemical change
having taken place in the powder, which
resulted in spontaneous combustion.
The loss in money 'represented by the
powder is comparatively small, for If all
the powder contained in the buildings was
lost the cost. would not be above $23,000.
The loss Is estimated by Admiral O'Neill
at between $15,000 and $10,000 and powder
Rnd ammunition. The loss to the build
ings Is considered trifling.
Loss Due to the Explosion
Will Not Aggregate
More Than $15,000.

INDIAN HEAD
NOT EXPENSIVE
BERLIN. Oct. 25.â A great sensation,
has been caused by the aliesratian. that
Count von Posadowsky-Wehner, Secre
tary of State for the Interior, had been
bribed with 12,000, marks for his work in
connection with the penal servitude bill
of 1898.
The allegation is contained in a letter
which is going the rounds of the German
press. The writer asserts that Herr
Krupp subscribed 5000 marks to the fund
constituting the alleged bribe.
The National Zeitune says It expects
that Count von Posadowsky-Wehner will
resign and nearly all the papers condemn
him severely. Â¦ â¢
All the evening papers comment upon
the official administration. The entire
Liberal' press now demands the resigna
tion of Count Posadowsky-Wehner and
Director von Woedtke, the assumption
being that the latter doubtless acted at
the suggestion of the former. The Ber
liner Tageblatt says:
"The sole consequence of the official
statement is both must resHgn."
A similar demand is made by the Vos
slsche Zeituns. which remarks:
"It is an unheard of proceeding that a
Government department should request
and receive large sums from one small
section of a population directly interested
in pending legislation for the purpose of
Influencing the nation against such legis
lation." Â¦ . . ,-,-\
The only papers which attempt to de
fend the Secretary of State for the In
terior are the Berliner Post, the Kreuz
Zeitung and the Berliner Nachrichten,
whose justification of his course in the
matter is weakly apologetic. -â¢Â¦

CHARGE AGAINST
GERMAN OFFICIAL
MANSFIELD. Ohio, Oct. 25.â In a pic
turesque little cemetery, where genera
tions of Mansfield's builders sleep, lie to
night the remains of John Sherman, Ohio's
Senator and the nation's statesman. There
all that is mortal of the former Secretary
of State was laid to rest to-day with cere
monies that were impressive and eloquent
ly simple. All Ohio contributed laurels
to the illustrious dead, and representing
the nation were President- McKinley, Sec
retary of War Root and other Washington
officials. The city was draped in mourn
ing. Every business housd closed at 2
o'clock and all the schools were dismissed
that the pupils might attend the services
at Grace Episcopal Church, where a half
century ago John Â¦ Sherman . first wor
shiped and where for years he was vestry
man.
From the funeral train, which arrived at
10:16 a. m.. the remains were escorted. to
the church* through streets that were
thronged with citizens and thousands who
had gathered here from other places. The
route was marked In the early - morning
with many political banners eulogistic of
national and State candidates of the va
rious parties, but as a mark of respect to
the dead all these were removed before
the procession began.
In the line of march were two compa
nies of the Eighth Ohio Volunteers, who
served In the Spanish war. while flanking
the hearse was a squad of forty-two sur
vivors of the famous Sherman brigade, -all
gray and bent with age, but stepping with
firm tread. . .
Among the attendants at the services
were Judge W. R. Day. Myron T. Herriok,
Mr. and Mrs. J. I. McCallum, General
Nelson A. Miles and Mrs. Miles, Mr. and

Senator Foraker. :,. ; Â¦Â¦' - .
Mayor Brown and a committee of citi
zens greeted President McKinley at the
station. Senator Hanna arrived an hour
later, from Chicago. " ' >
President McKinley and his Immediate
party. did not tarry at the church/where
the remains were left in state, but went
at once to. the residence of Congressn^an
Kerr, where luncheon was served and
where they remained until 2:30 p. m., the
time for the formal funeral services.
The honorary pallbearers were: General
Nelson A: Miles, Colgate Hoyt, P. T-.Sher
man, Frank B.^-Wlborg, John Sherman
Hoyt. William McCord. Alfred W. Boyle
and Charles A. Sherman. These escorted
the remains into*the church; which was
then thrown open to the public, and for
hours thousands of men. women and-chil
dren filed past the'taeket. When the time
arrived for the formal services the church
and grounds were crowded. The officiating
priest was Rev. A. B. Putnam, rector or
the church, who used the ritual exclusive

JOHN SHERMAN
NOW AT REST
NEW YORK, Oct. 23.â Awful depths
degradation have' been exposed' to the
public gaze through the investigation of
the murder of Jennie Bosschieter. The
horrid orgie that began on Thursday night
of last week in Christopher Baal's saloon
in Paterson, X. J., and that culminated
in the pretty mill girl's death on a lonely
country road had had many predecessors
alike in all but sequel. The four men
now In Passalc County Jail charged with
a crime punishable by death are said to
have openly boasted of their conduct until
one of their victims succumbed.
One young woman has come forward to
denounce two of the pfisoners. while
other girls well known in the community
have told their stories in- confidence,
shrinking from publicity.
Reputable residents of Paterson have
been shocked by the revelations and the
entire community is profoundly stirred.
A great mass-meeting is proposed to
discuss the conditions and to denounce
the open tolerance of vice. Several promi
nent men have taken great Interest lif-tho
suggestion that: there should be such a
meeting, as they are eager for an oppor
tunity to express their views upon the
girl's murder and the- conditions that led
up to It. The main object of the meeting
will be to volce.public sentlmenfand to
prove that persons who are now circulat
ing in the city trying to palliate the crime
form but a small minority.- It Is certain
that no effort will, be spared to save the
accused men, whose families are -very
wealthy and influential, and , prelimin
ary attempts are already, apparent.

THREE of the five battleships to
be contracted for before the year
closes will be of the Virginia type,
wood sheathed and coppered, arid
will have a displacement of 15,000
tons on a draught of 24 feet. They will
be 100 tons less displacement. The size of
these ships, their speed, protection and
armament place them ahead of any bat
tleship in other navies and relegate the
hitherto huge ships of Italy to a place
well down in the list.
The improvements in our battleships
since the first three were planned ten
With 1900 tons in the bunkers and' a full
supply of stores and ammunition' the
displacement will exceed 16.200 tons on a
draught of about 26 feet. The water-line
belt, about 192 feet In length, is to be 11
inches to 8 inches thick and the casement
armor protecting the broadside guns Is to
be 6 Inches; the large turrets and bar
bettes 10 inches and the smaller turrets 6
inches. The main battery consists of four
12-inch, eight 8-inch and twelve 6-lnch
quick-fires, and the secondary battery in
cludes twelve 3-pounders, eight 1-pounders
and twelve other machine, field and auto

years ago are certainly very remarkable
and scarcely generally recognized. The
speed, beginning with a demand for 15
knots, ha3 advanced uninterruptedly, until
now nothing less than 19 knots will
tlfe naval authorities. The 16J4-inch Har
veylzed armor of the Indiana is reduced
to 11 inches Krupp steel in the new ships,
and 12-inch high-powered rifles and quick
firing guns of 6-inch caliber take the place
of -13-inch turret guns and slow-firing 6
inch breech loaders. - Â¦ .
As compared with the six ships of the
Formidable class building- in England, the
Virginia has about 160 tons more displace
ment on 2 feet 9 Inches less draught than
the Formidable and Is calculated to have
3000 more horsepower and one knot great
er speed thaji the British battleship. The
Formidable's main battery comprises four
12-inch and twelve 6-inch qulck-flrer3 and
the armor belt Is of Harvey steel, 2 inches
less maximum thickness. It thus appears
as if the Virginia Is an all around better
ship than the Formidable, and this Is as
It should be, for nothing less would sat

too early as yet to say much in regard to*

In a voluminous complaint Dexter says
he was brought to Montana to go to work
on some of the paperswhich were to be es
tablished by r the Standard Oil "and .'Amalga
mated Copper companies for the purpose
of changing the political sentiment of the
State and electing, two United States Sen
ators who would represent the Standard
Oil Company in the Senate. He alleges
that he was taken into' the confidence of
the promoters of the scheme and that he
was told that the corporations had set
aside $1,000,000 for the purpose of working
up sentiment favorable .to the Standard
Oil and Amalgamated companies, alleged
to be represented by the Republican party.
Dexter, came to Montana in accordance
with an agreement, he says, and left his
"reasonably remunerative" Job to work
for the Standard Oil papers at J23 a week,
but he had been here only a few weeks
when he was discharged, and for that rea
son he wants $5000 damages. He also al
leges that ex-Senator Lee Mantle, who
owns the Evening Inter-Mountain in
Butte, was induced to enter into an al
liance with the Standard Oil and Amalga
mated companies, by which they were to
dictate the policy of his paper in the in
terest of the corporations and for the
election of two Senators to represent
them. Dexter left the city for the East

court.

ALLEGED PLOT OF

A recent dispatch from Brussels read: "Transvaal Delegate Fischer, accom
panied by one of Dr. Leyds' secretaries ai:d a reception committee, yesterday
visited the castle which has been offered as a residence to President Kruger.
The party admired the Gothic rooms and comfortable modern appointments, and
will recommend it to the Â¦ ex-President on his arrival. Monks built the castle
about the year 700, and King Leopold I slept in the room designed for Oom Paul.'.'
NEW YORK, Oct. 25.â That Southern
Pacific affairs are soon to be readjusted,
as was made necesasry by the death of
Collis P. Huntington, is indicated by the
fact that the new president for the
company has been practically decided
upon. The man who will be elected to
that position, unless some new compli
cation arises, is H. E. Huntington,
nephew of the late president, whose can
didacy has been so vigorously opposed.
Rumors that William K. Vanderbilt
had recently accfuired large holdings of
Southern Pacific." securities were circu
lated in Wall . street to-day and were
Beemingly well authenticated. That Mr.
Vanderbilt aims to control the property,
was denied by Southern Pacific interests,
but among so-called "Vanderbilt inter
ests" it was not denied that he and his
friends are now interested in the road to
a greater or lesser extent.
The rumor, as it spread, was enlarged,
according to Wall street habit, and be
fore the close of the market it was whis
pered that Mr. Vanderbilt had purchased
the Huntington holdings of the Southern
Pacific and was immediately to takÂ»:
control of the property. The improba
bility of this made denials of it unneces
sary. But that Mr. Vanderbilt may
hereafter have a voice in Southern Pa
cific affairs is not at all Improbable, and
to the Wall street view hia recent pur
chases of stock, coming In conjunction
with E. H. Harrlman's appearance as a
factor in the Pacific Mall Steamship
Company, are highly significant.
Mr. Vanderbilt's plans for Â¦ a great
trans-Atlantic line are generally believed
In, and Wall street regards E. H. Harri
man's position as the real executive of
the Union Pacific system to be indicative
of Vanderbilt'fl control there.
for the Presidency.
H. E. Huntington Said to Be Slated
PEACTICALLY DECIDED TJPON.
It is believed by practical railway man
agers that with the Southern Pacific
Railway system under a direct Vander
bilt control there will be at once a com
plete disposition of most of those elements
which hitherto have been Interfering with
far Western and Southwestern traffic
rates. ,
"Vanderbilt control of the Southren Pa
cific," declared one authority yesterday,
"will produce actual revolution in South
western railroad business. We will have
fair dealing. Secret rate cutting will stop.
Instead of deception, secret cuts, disturb
ances, losses and reprisals we can have
profits. In American railway financiering
nothing during the past twenty years has
been of so much consequence as the pos
sibility that William K: Vanderbilt takes
over the SouthernPaciflc ; and puts it upon
a level with the Union Pacific, Chicago
and' Northwestern and' New "iork Cen
tral." -. i ,
Acquiring control of the great South
ern Pacific . system (approximately 8000
miles) Is an accomplishment which makes
relatively insignificant the recent taking
over by the New York" Central of the
Boston and Albany property.
Within the past week Wall street be
came excited over the discovery that con
trol of Mr. Huntington's Pacific, Mail
property had passed to E. H. Harriman
and his associates, including James J.
Hill and W." K. Vanderbilt. Explanations
given much currency have aimed to rep
resent that only Mri Harriman had be
come controller, that Mr. Hill's interesc
and Mr. Vanderbllt's Interests were rela
tively insigniiicant.
However this may be, it is certain that
in the Southern Pacific deal (whereby
Vanderbilt interests will control) the cor
poration of the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company can be of vast interest. Aside
from the Vanderbilt ambition to estab
lish and maintain a transportation line
from the Atlantic coast at New York to
San Francisco and thence to the Far
East (made practicable by the New
York Central, Northwestern, Union Pa
cific and Pacific Mall), the taking over of
the Southern Pacific is an accomplish
ment greater than any other coalition
hitherto forecast.
The control of the Southern Pacific sys
tem, it can now be said, has now been ob
tained by American linancial interests not
hitherto identified with the property.
Conspicuous in the syndidate obtaining
the new control are "William K. Vander
bilt, E. H. Harriman, James J. Hill,:Nor
man B. Ream and James Speyer, the lat
ter, as the associate of Mr. Huntingdon,'
having been conspicuously Influential in
the direction of the company's affairs for
years past. Â¦ â¢' ;
The death of Mr. Huntington brought
about a complete change In the situation.
The personal equation disappeared. . A
German syndicate, bidding for a large
block of the stock In September, was not
without encouragement that its bid .would
be accepted for 100,000 shares en. bloc at
an average of $42. per .share. For. reasons
which on a business â¢ basis were consid
ered .satisfactory both here and atrLon
don,Â« however, the, bid for this 100,000
shares was rejected.
Negotiations aiming at this accomplish
ment were begun two years ago, but were
summarily disposed of by C. P. Hunting
ton. The property was' his, he said, and,
owning it, he proposed to keep it. k ' He
wanted no alliances which could to any"
extent make him dependent upon inter
ests other, than those for which he,him-
self stood. Thus important deals to which
New York, London and Berlin houses had
committed themselves were disposed of.

SAX BERXARDLNO. Oct. 25.-The op

pacity and hundreds were turned away at
the meeting to-night when John Barrett
and Senator Perkins addressed the people.
Judge C. X. Damron, president of the
Army and Navy Republican League, in
troduced John Barrett as the first speak
er. He described Siam as a wonderful
country, with a King who was the great
est statesman of all tne Asiatic rulers.
When leaving the King said to him:
""When you go back to America tell the
American people that I. as an Asiatic
monarch, and all the rulers of Asia wel
efcme American government as the beat
and most liberal in the world."
Speaking of Senator Perkins, he paid
h^m a high compliment, saying that May
or Pbelan would make a poor showing
rattling around In Perkins" shoes in the
Senate, and he hoped Perkins would live
long to defend the rights of California in
the Senate. Then he spoke of the Fili
pinos and other Asiatic nations as only
favoring Bryan that they might unload
their mass of cheap silver on this country.
He described Aguinaldo as tricky, wlly
Â«-nd treacherous, and as being sustained
In hopes of winning by circulars pent from
the Lnited States. The circulars, he said,
were sent by emissaries of Bryan. He
described at length the Filipino situation,
earing that "the Pacific Coast has every
thing to gain and nothing to lose by the
re-election of President McKinley, and
has nothing to gain and may suffer im
measurably by the election of Mr. Bryan.
The policy of President McKinley in the
Philippines and the Far East means a
greater and grander future for the com
monwealth of California and means the
development of this State's golden oppor
tunities." ,
Mr. Barrett Is a rapid speaker, a good
orator and he made the speech of. the
campaign for effect. He was followed by
Senator Perkins, who spoke ably and
earnestly of the various issues at stake,
touching on finance, imperialism and ex
pansion. This was the best meeting of
the Republican campaign thus far.

paper was read by T. F. White of Chlno

His paper was the feature of the ses
sion. A year ago we commenced sprink
ling our roads with oil in San Bernardino
County," said Mr. White. "Three applica
tions were made during the season. This
spring we made but one application, using
a hundred to a hundred and fifty barrels
to the mile, tho oil being applied as hot
as Ross-ibleâ f rom 200 degrees up. The
roads treated are dustless, wear splendid-*
ly and resemble bitumen-surfaced roads.
"In my own. town. of Chino we selected
for experiment a sandy road, which we
surfaced with clayey gravel. After grad
ing, eoaking with water and rolling hard,
oil was put on and the result Is a road,
which is hard and smooth and shows no
appreciable Wear after a year's hard
. Mr. White was followed by J/L.- Maude.

delivered a short address and concluded &

Some one has recently been tampering
with switches along the line south of here

had been broken. Several other switches

LIQUOR TRAFFIC AND
SUFFRAGE DISCUSSED
NEW YORK, Oct. 25.-Mrs. Mabel
Hanson, young and strikingly
beautiful, met death to-day
through what is said to have
been accidental, poisoning at the
home of her parents, Mr. and Mrs.
Charles H. Applegate, 22 West Sixty-first
street. According to her relatives Mrs.
Hanson, who was 23 years old and a
woman of refinement, attempted to relieve
a nervous headache by talcing valerian,
but instead swallowed carbolic acid. She
died in great agony while two physicians
worked to save her life.
Mrs. Hanson was married when 16 years
old to J. S. Hanson, a San Francisco
business man. She went to the Pacific
Coast with her husband, but had been
East on a visit to her parents for nearly
a year. Her father is editor of .a trade
paper published at 73 Fulton street.
Mrs. Hanson's mother and two sisters
were in an adjoining room when Mrs.
Hanson swallowed the poison. According
ta their statements Mrs. Hanson was J11
her usual good spirits this morning, but
shortly before noon &he complained of
headache and her mother advised her to
take some valerian. She went to the
bathroom, where a small medicine chest
Is kept, but said. she could not find the
valerian and went out to purchase some.
When she returned she again entered the
bathroom and a moment later her mother
and sisters heard groans. They ran to
the bathroom and as they reached the
door Mrs. Hanson staggered out and fell
into their arms, gasping, "Get a doctor,
quick." One of the sisters summoned
a nearby phvsiclan. Mrs. Hanson was un
conscious when he reached her side. He
Immediately sent word to Roosevelt Hos
pital. Dr. Bainton arrived with an ambu
lance in a few minutes. Two. physicians
worked over the woman for nearly an
hour but she never regained conscious
ness. In the bathroom a bottle contain
ing carbolic acid was found, i Its .label
showed that it'eame from the drug store
of Dougan & Merritt, Columbus avenue
and Sixty-first street. The clerk who sold
the acid said that Mrs. Hanson, whom he
had known for a year'or more as a cus
tomer, had called about noon and asked
for carbolic acid. -
"Mrs. Hanson was not agitated, eaid
the drug clerk. "She explained that she
Meanwhile he had become enamored of
a talented young vocalist in this city but
she resented his attentions. Then throÂ»
days after an introduction to Miss Laura
Hecock of Oakland he married her, the
two making a romantic journey to Reno
New This was last February. From the
New York dispatch it is apparent that
the parents of Hanson's first wife were
not aware of their separation by the
courts.
wanted It for disinfection purposes and I
had no reason for refusing to sell it. ' I
entered the sale in the poison book. She
did not purchase'any valerian and did not
mention it."
Mrs. Applegate and her "daughters were
prostrated by the death of Mrs. Hanson.
They said she had not been Oespondent.
They asserted that her relations with her
husband were most, cordial and that she
intended returning to San Francisco next
week. They were positive that she took
poison by mistake, but were unable to ex
plain Mrs. Hanson's ourchase of carbolic
acid when she went "out to obtain vale
rian.
J. S.- Hanson, husbandof the dead wom
an, is a fur dealer at 112 Kearny street of
this city. He came from. New York with
his wife two years ago, where he was
also a trader with the Arctic furriers.
Hanson had little to say concerning his
former wife except that he was divorced
from her a year ago. He wept when
he heard the manner of her death and
begged that her name be dealt with gent
ly by , the newspapers.
Hanson married Miss Mabel Applegate
in New York City six years ago.' She was
beautiful and accomplished . and resided
at 22 West Sixty-first street. The furrier
had an extensive business and continued
it on the ehorerf. of.-the Atlantic for four
years after his marriage. Then he came
West and located in this city. He resid
ed here at 925 Haight street.
After the couple took up their residence
here their domestic troubles commenced
and terminated in divorce proceedings.
Mrs. Hanson was sent to New York. b7
her husband more than a year ago for
treatment in a sanitarium. She had be
come addicted to the drug habit. About
twt> months after Mrs. Hanson went to
New York her . husband, despairing of
hope for her reformation, asked the San
Francisco courts for a divorce. He se
cured one.

TAYLOR ON THE STAND.
Tells How ' King* Denied His Identity
When Captured. ;
SAN RAFAEL. Oct. 25.â The trial of J.
E. King for.. the..murder of S. H. Church
was resumed in the Superior Court here
this â¢ morning. The prosecution put Mrs.
S. H. Church, her daughter, Mrs. S. L. .;
Stice. and the son, Herman, on the stand.
They testified to the declarations of the
deceased when carried into the house i
after the shooting, claiming that Church;
declared that King shot him because he
had threatened to have him arrested. The
most interesting witness of the day was
Sheriff W. P. Taylor. He told how King
had denied his identity when flrat brought
to the jail, claiming that his name was
Jameson. The prisoner's . mental and
physical condition at this time was very
bad. â¢ >' ' . * '
Deputy Sheriff Goe and Constable Clark
next told how they captured King near 1
Paskenta and how he denied his Identity !
at the time. The prosecution here rested.
Attorney- Lennon for the defense said
he would make no opening statement, but
would proceed" with the evidence. The;
defense put' on. about half a dozen neigh
bors and acquaintances ofS. H. Church
and asked them if they knew his general
i reputation for being a quarrelsome, and
turbulent man. With one exception they
said, when pressed, that they did not
know. The next, witness was J. J. Arm
strong, who searched King's camp after
the shooting and was only able to find one
empty rifle shell. Roland B. Andrews was
then called. He testified that Stice told
him on the day of the Inquest on Church's
body to say nothing about the gun that he
(Stice) had found lying down by King's
camp, This testimony impeached that
given by Stice, he having 1 denied having
made such statements. It Is expected
that the trial will continue through the
week.
of the Yosemite National Park, with
Troop F of the Sixth United States Cav
alry, the park has never been in a bet
ter condition. Four thousand dollars is
appropriated annually for the mainte
nance of the park. This year more actual
Improvements have been made than dur
ing any season heretofore. A cable bridge
is now being constructed over the Merced
river near Hennessey's Raneh, so that
tlie mail may be carried into the Yosemite
durlr-g the winter. There has always
nÂ«n great difficulty in fording the river.
It was necessary lor the mail carrier to
have two horses", one on each Fide of the
stream, and he himself had -to '"trip the
troMey." going through mid-air with the
mail bag under Mf arm. Fording the
river ni not the only difficulty, as there
never has been an accessible trail from
the river to thÂ» valley, and the mail car
rier iva*= often delayed- several days, stop
ping at a cabin near the Cascades, built
for that purpose. About $1500 Is being
expended to repair this trail, which will
not only benefit the mail service, bnt the
inhabitants* of Yosemite during the win
ter months. Two thousand dollars has
bÂ«Â»en expended for a trail into Hetcn
Hetchy Valley, which will open that un
known region to the public.
Major Rucker contemplates building a
road to Lake Ostrander - and through
Bloody Canyon next year. This will re
vtal new wonders, enabling the tourists
from Yosemite to make excursions back
into the }--urrounding mountains.
This is the first time that United States
cavalry horses in the valley have enjoyed
the cemfort of shelter. Heretofore tney
have always withstood the storms un
protected, sometimes standing in five to
ten Inches ol snow. The major had his
men construct a very artistic shed of
rough pine logs, covered with heavy can
va.Â«.
Major Rucker strongly advocates the
purchase of the toll roads into the Yo
*emite by the Government. The. present
appropriation would not be sufficient to
keep up the roads. It would require about
$*kjO a year for repairing and making such
improvements as j s necessary on the
roadf.
Never before in the history of the park
has game been so plentiful. Beare are
frequently sepn within a quarter of a mile
of the hotels They appear to be quite
gentle and frequently will run in front of

ers often see from fifteen to twenty deer
grazing by the roadside and conveys of
quail are encountered at almost every
bend of thÂ« road. The streams and lakes
abound with mountain trout. Trout in
the lakes have been caught weighing from
one to six pounds. The Wawona hatch
ery planted 750.000 small trout in the var
ious lakes and streams in the park this
season.
There have been about 5000 visitors in
the park this season. Â¦
No definite time has been set for the
troop to return to the Presidio, as it is
awaiting General. Shafter's orders.

SAN JOSE, Oct. 25.â Jack Ortega took
the stand In his own behalf to-day. Ha
was a witness most of the day and his
cross-examination will occupy a good part
of to-morrow. He told of his 'whereabouts
on August 2S. the night of the assault on
Grace Gamble. From early morning till
midnight the pugilist endeavored to ac
count for himself. Ilia testimony filled
in with that of other witnesses tor ythe
defense. Under questioning of District
Attorney Campbell he lost'his temper and
answered I in a sullen tone.
Ortega testified that he had Ktine ridln#
early In the evening with Addle BartlÂ«-y
and left her about 9:30 o'clock. He drove
about town for awhile and after buylur;
a watermelon started for his home. Tnia
was about 10 o'clock. A companion was
with him. He remained at his home antil
10:15. Then he drove to* the Willow Par*
saloon. Ortega denied he had seen Grac3
Gamble before his arrest and denied that
on the night in question he had taken
her in his busrgy. On cross-examination
he stuck to the story pretty well. His
testimony as a whole did not make much
of an Impression, as his Identification by
the sirl and other witnesses was roo&t
positive.
Half ;Â» dozen other witnesses were ex
amined during the day, but they gave no
new testimony.
The Ortegas caused somewhat of a ien
sation during the day by causing the ar
rest of Joe Gomez, one of the most Im
portant witnesses for the prosecution, on
a charge of .disturbing the peace. Gomez
Identified the horse and buggy In which
the girl wasridlnff as that of Ortega's.
Shortly after the preliminary examination
the Ortegas charged Gomez with perjury
in Justice Hirsch's court at Santa Clara.
The case Is still pending. ) V-*

WITH WHOM HE HAD STARTED WEST.
The woman was allowed to see Joyce in
the prison, and as he walked from his cell
she threw her arms around htm and tried
to slip him a bottle of whisky. She was
arrested and then gave her name as Nel
lie Hamilton and said sne was Joyce's
sweetheart.
Subsequently a woman giving her name
as Mrs. Humphreys and caylng she was
the divorced wife of Joyce called on htm.
He acknowledged that he had been mar
ried to the woman. She put up $5 as ball
for Miss Hamilton and the two women
went away together.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 'J>.â George W.
Joyce was living in this city last Janu
ary with his wife and two children. He
met Annie Slefert, a domestic In the fam
ily of Judgo Smith, and learning that she
liad some money saved, made love to and
married her. A week later he deserted
her, after securing all her money, and
disappeared. Before his departure from
this city he succeeded in passing four
bogus checks for small sums. Detective
Hawley left here to-night for San Fran

could not be located to-nisfht. It is doubt

received for the ticket. Gordon said that
the old man was penniless and unless
money was sent he would have to ba
taken to thepoorhouse.
Mrs. Suva asked Captain Seymour to lo
cate Joyce and see that he was punished
for his heartless treatment of her hus
-band. She said Joyce had also taken with
him her daughter's ring. Th<Â»
captain, detailed Detective Ross "Whltta
ker on the case and he located Joyce at
765 Market street. The captain wired
Mrs. Suva to consult with the police in
New York, as he was powerless to act
unless a warrant was Issued for his ar
rest. Whlttaker was meantime instructed
to shadow him.
Yesterday morning Captain Seymour
was delighted to receive a letter from
Chief Elton of Los Angeles asKing him to
arrest Joyce for forgery, as he held a
warrant for him on that charge. Tha
Chief said Joyce had committed numerous
forgeries in Los Angeles and that there
was more than one woman who claimed
him as her husband. His first wife was
to leave Â» Los Angeles to meet him at 7^
Market street. Shortly after the receipt
of the Irtter the Caplain got a dispatch
from Chief Elton that the wife nad not
left for San Francisco - but had, instead,
posted a letter to Joyce.
Whittaker was at once Instructed to ar
rest Joyce and yesterday afternoon he
caught him as he was -entering his lodg
ing-house. Chief Elton had forwarded a
photogmph of him which satisfied Whit
taker beyond doubt that l.e was the man
he had previously located.
Joyce is a good looking man, about 20
years of age. and dresses well. "When

that he had committed any -orpery In

IF the charges against him be true,
George W. Joyce, a drummer, who is
in the "tanks" at the City Prison, is
as heartless a scoundrel as has ever
come under the cognizance of the
police. He is not only accused of being
a bigamist and forger but also, of robbing
a helpless old man and leaving him pen
niless and friendless in a strange city.
A few days ago Captain Seymour re
ceived a letter from Mrs. Hannah Suva,
448 Fourth avenue. New York City, to the
; effect that Joyce had married her daugh
i ter Louise on October 3 and had left witn
her husband, Martin Suva, a frail old
man, the following: day for San Fran
cisco on a visit to his friends in this
State for the benefit of the old man's
health. She inclosed a letter she had re

efforts made by the officers in command
to protect them from, the "grafters" who
formerly secured the major portion of
their earnings and gave them so little for
it. In the building where the men are
paid off quarters have been set aside for
the representatives of the Santa Fe and
Southern Paciflc railroads. By purchas
ing their tickets from these agents the
men make a saving of many dollars. The
rate from San Francisco to St. Louis haa
been fixed at $28 75 and as the discharged
men are allowed 4 cents a mile they make
a profit of $48 on the trip. In. tiie trip be
tween this city and Chicago a saving of
$60 is made provided the. men purchase
their tickets at the Presidio and steer
clear of the sharks that infest the
grounds. John J. Byrne, general passen

the Presidio yesterday and instructed the
men as to their rights.

lreme . , Court intervened and a writ of

i^-auy la.n night will prolong Chretien's
i tay m the County jali for a short time
i.t least.
The trouble into which the South Amer
ican general, C. H. M. y Agramonie, was
riunged in Judge Cabaniss' Police Court
Vi ar ' es<Jay was responsible for Cnretien's
traditional trouble. Chretien was sub

llis services being dispensed with by
Judge Cabar.lss. he proceeded to delve
f-mor.g the records of the criminal courts.
Jt is said â mostly among these relating to
the Patrick Hogers and William Harris
cases. Since going to Jail it is rumored
ihat Chretien has worked up quite a
l^gal business, and among those defend
nms In whom he is interested are the de-
Jer.aarts named.
The- matter was called to the attention
<<i Judge Dunne yesterday morning, who
forthwith revoked the writ of prob

Mr. Chretien has beon enjoying too much

my belief that he has enjoyed unusual
privileges in the past, the Judgment

T'nd^r Sheriff Hare said that it was his

Cutting Freight Hates.
In order to head off the freight teams
which for several years have been draw
ing an increasing amount of freight from
the railroads the Southern Pacific has
been forced to make cut rates to some ol
the Interior towns. Auto trucks have in
some instances been adopted and because
of their swiftness they have become keen
competitors of the railroads. The freight
ers have another, advantage over the. rail
roads in that they can load at the doors
of wholesale houses and discharge their
loads at the doors of retailers, thus 'sav
ing time and drayage at both ends of the
haul. The towns flrst to receive the ben
efit of the cut rate are Pomona, Ontario,
Smelzer and others ; in the . southern ? part
of the State. The new rates have been
fixed at $2 60 per ton. The intention of ths
company " is to ; eventually ; carry ? out * this

BOY STENOGRAPHER
CANNOT BE FOUND
Police Trying to Elucidate the Mys
tery of Robert Chessman's
Disappearance.
- The mysterious disappearance of Rob
ert Chessman, a boy 19 years oÂ£ age. has
been reported to the police, and Detectives
Ed Gibson ; and Reynolds are endeavoring
to t elucidate the mystery. So far they
have met with no success.
The boy i was â¢ employed as stenographer
with the firm of Dunham, Carritcan &
Hayden. Last -Monday- he complained of
being sick and left the' store about 2
o'clock-in the afternoon and since, then Â¦
not the slightest trace Â¦ of : him has been
found. ,Hls ' father is E. . E. Chessman;
1330,Church street, and he says* that; the
boy i never stayed away : from home be
fore for a single night. Young. Chessman
weighs about : 150 â¢ pounds, is :nve feet: six
inches tall,* has browr." hair and eyes.,
medium, light complexion and dimples on
his f ace. - He Â¦ wore a Â¦ dark gray single
breasted sack suit, blue striped shirt and
standing 'collar, and fedora hat. .;,-;.Â»
Â¦-'â¢' The : boy was regular,- in his - habits , and
he Â¦ was never = heard : to . express any . dis
satisfaction ' with . his employment â¢: or tpo-'
sition in life. His . employers say that
money matters had nothing to do with
his disappearance, for in his position he
did not have the handling of any coin.
His description has been sent to all the
police stations and every outgoing steam
er and train is being watched.
the time Mrs. Shepperd finished with tfco
children it was invariably 7:30 o'clock.
Mrs. Shepperd arrived from the. East
last February on the request of Dr. Wil
son, who paid her fare. She immediately
Interested herself in selling tickets for a
concert the reverend gentleman was giv
ing. She then became associated with .the*
Society of Friends and Induced them to
allow her to get up a concert for the "Si
lent "Workers." Ir has been stated since
that she received 50 per cent of the tick
ets sold- The concert was held in Sher
man &. Clay's Hall and was crowded to
the doors. Since then Mrs. Shepperd has
started this cooking school with donations
and subscriptions that nave been solicited
in the ctty by a corps of young ladles
who received a certain percentage for the*
money they-collectedk Mrs. Shepperd ta
living at the Grand Hotel and boarding
at the Palace Hotel. She is a very hand
some widow with a fine figure that is su
perbly set off in the very latest of tailor
made gowns.
A Call reporter visited the school yes
terday afternoon, and while in the vicin
ity called on several mothers of the pu
pils of the cooking school. One mother
stated that the class had dropped off to
half its original number on account of the
actions of Airs. Shepperd. The children,
she said, went into the school after public
school hours, and they were taught cook-
Ing from 3 to 6. and then Mrs. Shepperd
took them in hand. . She presented each
girl with a toothbrush, examined their
finger nails and gave them instructions
about keeping their shoes polished. By
first rub came when she was requested to
come down on Saturday nights and cook
coffee for the parents of the children,
who are "received" on that night. . She
also says that Mrs. Shepperd shows such
an ungovernable temper that It is im
possible to get along with her. Miss Mont
gomery, who is superintendent of the
school, has also resigned, but when inter
viewed she said she would prefer not to
make any statement.
It Is on the Verge of Disruption After Only Three Short Weeks of
Existence, and Teachers and Pupils Are Leaving.
Yesterday Mrs. Ida F. Piatt, who was
engaged to teach the children cooking,
said she had handed in her resignation
and would no longed be connected with
the school for several reasons. She says
she is a graduate from a cooking school
In Boston, and was employed to give the
children a lesson every afternoon. The
The school . was opened about three
weeks ago by Mrs. Shepperd. Children of
the lower class were to be taught how to
cook, but the class has dwindled down
to half Its original size and the ladles
who are employed by Mrs. Shepperd claim
that they - have been forced to resign on
account of Mrs. Shepperd's arbitrary and
authoritative manners. >
Mrs. Maryland Bartlett Shepperd's Lit
tle Mother's Cooking School, at 942 Harri
son street, is in distress, and the em
ployes of the institution are leaving one
by one."
Commencing November 1 all the -freight
handlers in the local offices of the South
ern Pacific will receive an Increase In
their pay amounting to 2 l A cents an hour,
or 25 cents a day. The raise will "benefit
between 200 and 300 hands.
In 1S33, when Industries all over the
United States were curtailing expenses
and reducing wages, a cut was made in
the salary list of the freight handlers.'
Since then the . employes have beeu
working for $2 a day. A few days ago a
petition was circulated praying for 'a
restoration of the old wage schedule en
the ground that times are better and the
amount of work that each man Is called
upon to perform has been materially in
creased. â¢
The petition was signed by every em
ploye In the freight .department. It was
presented to Manager J. A. Flllmore. who
consulted -with Julius Kruttschnltt. Yes
terday it was decided to grant the - re
quest. Notices* to that 'effect will bo
posted at once.

A holographic will executed by the late

a sensation in church and business cir
cles, was filed for probate yesterday. Fur
ther than serving the purpose of convey
ing to the world what disposition the de

ument serves no Â¦ purpose. By reason of
the fact that a portion of the date Is
printed the will is illegal.

Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company and
the Mutual Life -Insurance Company of
New York. His estate, however, â¢ does not
exceed $3000 in value, it ; is stated In the
petition accompanying the will. .
A significant clause Is incorporated In
the will.^It reads: \
In taking out all of, these policies I have had
In mind not only the protection of my family
but also that of my creditors, the persons -who
have had Â«uf ficlent i confidence in my ; integrity
a* to place | their j funds < with '! me.- 1 i therefore
request that the amount received by the reason
of ; the payment of the policies shall be drawn
upon If necessary to pay in full my just debts
should my - personal and real estate be insuffi

to take his life there Is pathos in this last
provision, Â¦ which -iwlll doubtless; -work to

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
It is hardly necessary to say the rivalry we are pre
paring for the older States will be beneficial to them.
The magnificent ships built . in our shipyards have
been an incentive to Eastern builders to improve upon
their former, methods. We shall see whether they can
beat the Wisconsin. If they cannot; we shall rely
upon the Union Iron Works to improve upon .".it.
There are more battleships to be constructed. The
end is not yet. Thecrown of achievement has not
been reached. The Marine Journal would better ad
vise its readers to make ready, for a prolonged hustle.
Just why the Marine Journal should note the tri
umph of Pacific Coast shipyards with. either sorrow
or anger is not clear. The upbuilding of this coast is
not going to injure the East. If, however, such feats
as we have accomplished make them sorry, then much
sorrow is in store for them, for it is as sure as any
thing in the future can be that the Pacific Coast will
soon be engaged in manufacturing on an extensive
scale in all important lines of industry. With the de
velopment of the commerce of the Pacific Ocean there
will grow up all along this coast extensive industries
in the manufacture of all kinds of goods needed by
the peoples of countries facing on that ocean. The
successes achieved in the way of building ships attract
more attention than those attained in other lines, but
they do not 'Stand aione. Battleships are not "the
only pebbles on the beach" of Pacific Coast industries.
We are preparing to challenge the East all along the
line, and the cry, "Pray first and hustle afterward,"
will have to be sounded to more people than ship
builders. Â¦Â»Â«... .
Commenting upon the telegram the Marine Jour
nal of New York says: "This furnishes what philoso
phers call food for thought. After the first blush of
surprise at the audacity of the Pacific Slope in chal
lenging the East in the science of iron ship building,
and battleships at that, we can only settle down to the
conviction that there is much , more behind it than
Western swagger. * * * When' we rub the in
credulity out of our eyes the fact stares us in the face
that the slope is accomplishing wonders in its ship
yards. More than thirty Vessels is the record for the
past three years. * * * More in sorrow than in.
anger we have to admit that the East is not the only
pebble on the great coastline of Uncle Sam's do
minions. Let us prayâ and 'immediately thereafter
let us hustle."
BY a simple telegram to a friend in the East an

PERSONAL MENTION.
The whole question of proper labeling is one on
which the people of California can well afford to take
a strong stand. We have more to gain than to lose
by right labeling. ' If the decision of Judge Lacombe
b<: extended to all sorts of labels the people of Cali
fornia will have no reason to be dissatisfied.
That view of the case has been taken by many of the
foremost authorities in the wine trade. Thus The Call
recently received a note from Lee J. Vance, editor of
the New York American Wine Press, approving the
stand The Call has taken upon the matter, and say
ing: "There is no doubt that some of the labels on
California wines must be changed, and it is a good
time to change them now. Thus far few persons or
few papers have defended the use of foreign names on
our native wines. It seems to be settled that our
winemakers have no moral, legal or business right
to use such names."
It is because of the experience we have ourselves
had in that direction that a majority of the people of
California approved the decision of the French
authorities of the exposition concerning Cali
fornia wines that were labeled as French
wines. It is recognized here that there is no
reason why our wines should be wrongly
marked. They are fully able to stand upon their
merits, and the reputation of the State as a wine pro
ducing country will be increased when all her wines
are sent to market clearly marked as California
products.
It has been known for a long time that a good deal
of cheap and comparatively worthless fruit produced
in the East and prepared for market there is branded
with the word "California.". The sale of such tends
to prejudice the consumer against all California fruit,
and the wrong done is. therefore much greater than
appears on the surface.
Should this decision of the Circuit Court receive
confirmation from the Supreme Court and stand as
the law of the land a great victory will have been
gained not only for honest labeling but for pure food.
It has long been the custom for the manufacturers of
spurious wines, beers and foods of various kinds tc
place false labels upon them. Such articles are not
always harmful â indeed as a rule they are harmless
enough â but they are of an inferior quality and their
sale is an injury to the consumer and to the trade of
the men whose brands are counterfeited. ,
A VICTORY FOR RIGHT LABELING.
SOME time ago the various brewing. companies
of Milwaukee filed in the United States Circuit
Court a bill of complaint alleging that a certain
New York company was using the word "Milwaukee"
upon labels of beer not made in that city and was
selling the same as Milwaukee beer. They asked for
a perpetual injunction, and the court has recently
granted it. The report of the case states: "Judge
Lacombc's order perpetually enjoins the defendant
from selling or offering for sale any beer in recep
tacles bearing the word Milwaukee, excepting onlj
beer actually brewed in the city of Milwaukee, Wis."

the fmports' were' 3.020,800 .gallons of American
rnd 2.840,000 gallons of Russian petroleum. The
reason for this Is said to be the fact that large
Russian oil fields have been acquired by Eng

of 1900, 3.50O.COO cases of Russian petroleum,
against 6.410,C00 cases In the same period of

"In the yeor 1S38 there were Imported into
the State of California 1,740,027 tons of coal.
To supplant this 6,794,278 barrels of oil will bo
needed. The perfect cleanliness of fuel oil
and the simplicity of supply and - regulation
make it the moat desirable substitute for coal.
As lonsr as coal remains at $7 50 per ton In
California it cannot be expected that oil will
fall below its present priceâ at least not for
some years to come. A comparison of the con
gumption of fuel oil with that of coal shows
3.33 barrels of oil are equivalent to one ton of
pood Imported coal. Figuring oil at $1 40 per
barrel and coal at $7 50 prr ton, it shows the

The State . Mineralogist has recently visited
Ran Ardo district, which Is between King City

Mr. Cooper, "that district will be the equal of
ar.y In the State. The district is about seven
miles long and one mile wide." Mr. Cooper is
satisfied that tho day is not far distant when
oil territory will be selected' by greoloKlsts on
account of favorable structure and position. Ir
respective of Burface bitumens. ' A somewhat
Interesting computation made by Mr. Cooper is
as follows:
SDeaking of the expectations entertained in
various, parts of tho country concerning the
productiveness of oil wells, Mr. Cooper said
that in Ohioabou^t eighty wells are drilled per
annum, and these Ohio wells average only
about ten barrels per day each. They are
pumped until they yield only one-half barrel
per day. CalifornJans would not think of
operating wells on such a low basis of produc
tion. "The Kern River district alone." said
Mr. Cooper, "should yield over 1,000.000,000 bar
rels of oil. The sand averages 100 feet In
thickness and the area of the field" is about
fifteen square miles. Perhaps that oil will
bring 90 cents net. Illustrating the possibili
ties that are In the oil sands Mr. Cooper said
that one field In Russia, of less than twenty
acres In extent, has already yielded 35,000,000
barrels of oil.
The history of the oil fields of tho world Is
that they have been started In shallow and
have been deepened. All California wells are
comparatively shallow.'
Mr. Cooper said that practically the same set
of facts had been found to be applicable wher
ever petroleum has been found in the oil fields
of the world. Assuming it to be the fact that
petroleum owes Its origin to the distillation of
carbonaceous matter, there is a probability of
getting petroleum way down to the metamor
ohlc rocki Near the surface, and down to a
dopth of several hundred feet, evaporation has
dlsDosed of the volatile matter and tho oil Is
comparatively thick. Down below the possible
IpvpI of evaporation is thinner and more valu
able oil.
A. 8. Cooper, Rtate Mineralogist, nays that If
the future realizes what may reasonably be
expected, from existing conditions, the value of
California's petroleum output will in four years
catch up with the gold production of the State.
Mr. Cooper also made several other interesting
statements. HÂ« says tho probability is that
where the shallow oil fields begin to fall, it
will be only necessary to go down another 500
feet in depth to secure a new supply and that
the oil on the lower strata will be of better
quality than that. lying nearer the surface. TÂ»K
lne" this view of the case, Los Angeles has
really only begun to develop its possibilities in
petroleum.

THE RE-ELECTION OF LOUD.
WHILE Mr. Loud stands before the people of
the Fifth Congressional District as the repre
sentative of Republicanism and the champion
of the McKinley administration, it should not be over
looked that his claims upon the voters for re-election
are higher than those of partisanship. He is the fore
most Californian in the House; he holds there a
higher position than any other; he has an influence and
a prestige there of great value to the whole Pacific
Coast, and that influence he never fails to exert for
the benefit of all.
It is an honor to the people of the Fifth District
to be represented at the national capital by a man of
sufficient ability and repute to enable him to command
the chairmanship of one of the most important com
mittees of the House. It should be, furthermore, a
gratification to them that their representative has
used his high position to benefit not only his own
district and his own State, but the whole country.
Among the younger leaders of the Republican party
in Congress none has done more for the improvement
of the government and the general good of the people
thin Mr. Loud has done in improving and extending
the service of the postoffice. Had he achieved noth
ing more than the establishment of the rural free deliv
er}' system he would still take rank among the Con
gressmen whose work entitles them t to be ranked as
progressive and constructive statesmen. Mr. Loud has
done more to augment the usefulness of the Postal
Department than any other man who has been in
Congress for years: but the full measure of his pro
gramme of improvement has not yet been accom
plished, and consequently his defeat would be felt as
a loss to the whole country.
California has been comparatively without influence
in Washington because for a long period of years she
nas changed her representatives so frequently that not
even the ablest and most faithful had time to make
his worth felt in the House. A continuous succession
of new men have followed one another from district
after district in the State, and as a result in the making
up of committees none of them obtained chairman
ships. The people of the Fifth District were the first
in California to perceive the folly of such fickleness
and to adopt the New England plan of choosing a
good representative and re-electing him term after
term. They are now enjoying the benefits of that
wisdom. They have a representative who can do
more for them than any other representative they have
ever had. They see the proofs of it all around them.
In the city the evidence of Mr. Loud's service is seen
in the magnificent postoffice building now in process
of construction, and in the rural portions of his dis
trict it can be seen in the free delivery' system, which
has not only provided them with a great convenience,
but by reason of that convenience has added to the
value of their homes.
From the cordial greeting with which Mr. Loud has
been received at all of his meetings in the district
satisfactory conclusions can be drawn of the inten
tion of the people to re-elect him. The one danger is
that of overconfidence. Every Republican in the dis
trict should work for Mr. Loud and work earnestly.
The candidate who represents all the sound and well
tried policies of the Republican party should not be
set aside for a man who represents Bryanism, neither
should a Congressman who ranks among the leaders
of the House be set aside for an inexperienced man
who could not aspire to a chairmanship of even the
humblest and most insignificant committee. One
good turn deserves another, and since Mr. Loud has
stood firmly by his constituents, they should as frmly
stand by him.

the city is placed bc f ore the people somebody dis
covers a provision in the instrument which blocks
progress altogether or places insurmountable ob
jects in its path.
A few days ago the North Central improvement
Club, an organization of property-owners residing 1
rorth of Clay street, filed a petition with the Bo?rd of
Public Works asking that estimates be made for the
preliminary cost of widening Jackson street from
Montgomery avenue to East street, offering to take
charge of the expenses and pay them out of its treas-..
ury. The presentation of this petition was preceded
by considerable work and calculation, and it was
thought some money might be saved if the expenses
could be paid by the officers of the club instead of
being contracted for by the liberal subordinates of
the Board of Public Works.
It appears, however, that this arrangement is not
authorized by the charter. One of the numerous de
partment officials of tV>e board has examined into the
question and discovered that no action can be taken
in the direction of widening Jackson street between
the thoroughfares named until the North Central Im
provement Club has deposited a sum of money with
the Commissioners sufficient to meet the cost of ad
vertising, engineering and printing. Exactly what
these items will amount to is not stated, but the club
has been informed that not even an estimate will be
made of them until somebody guarantees that the in
cidental labor will b; paid for.
We do not know that this necessarily puts an end
to the project of widening Jackson street, but it inter
poses an obstacle which it will require time to over
come. The purpose of the North Central Improve
ment Clnb is to lift up and place upon its feet the
northern portion of the city. This region is afflicted
with cobbles, dilapidated sidewalks, decaying build
ings and narrow streets, and for twenty-five or thirty
years no one has paid the slightest attention to its in
terests. It is thought that by widening Jackson street
a broad, level thoroughfare to the ferry can be es
tablished, around which will cluster important busi
ness houses, and which will bring in its train a long
line of private improvements.
But at every step of their progressive movement
the citizens interested in this portion of the city seem
to have been met by charter objections. While they
are overcoming the difficulties it would be. well for
those of them who voted for the. adoption of the in
strument to repent of their folly. So far as real
progress is concerned they seem to' have jumped f-om
the consolidation act fryingpan into the charter fire.
There is more than one way in which" our republi
can independence can make reprisals for the preten
sions of effete royalty. King Leopold of Belgium has
become the partner of a mining speculator of Colo
rado. King Leopold has money and thinks that he
needs some experience in his business.
.Our English cousins on the racecourse have some
very pronounced and unique notions of American
sportsmen. When an American loses the English
consider him to be a good fellow and a sport; when
an American wins the English are sure that he is a
sharper and a cheat.
The Supervisors intend to send an expert to ap
praise the Widber property at Mountain View. It
is a safe bet that his Highness the Mayor, after his
hefting experience, will not be the man.
The Georgia swain who positively declined to wed
a baldheaded girl probably feared that in the exigen
cies of domestic quarrels he .would be at a serious
disadvantage.
Thr State Board of Health will meet shortly in this
city to discuss quarantine affairs. This ought to give
our local bubonic board an opportunity to ask for a
vacation.
SOrt\E WORDS OF McKINLEY.
v
DAY after day for weeks past the papers of the
country, in fulfillment of their duty as news
gatherers for the people, have published the
iteration and reiteration of Bryan's harangues. They
will have to continue to do so for some days to come.
In the meantime McKinley keeps the silence which
the dignity of his high office imposes upon him. His
words are not spread before the country every day,
and it is therefore right and fitting that something of
what he has said upon issues Bryan is talking about
every day should be recalled to the public mind.
Bryan has been lovd in denouncing the army, join
ing it in the general condemnation which he pro
nounces upon "militarism" and "imperialism." Here
are some of the things McKinley has said about the
army:
What a magnificent army was mustered in less than
sixty days! More than two hundred thousand soldiers
responded to the call of country, coming from the homes
of our fellow-citizens everywhere, the bravest and the
best, willing to go into foreign territory to flght for
thft honor of our flag and for oppressed humanity. There
was no break in our column. There was no division
in any part of the country. North and South and Kast
and West alike cheerfully responded.â Speech 'at De
catur, Illinois, October 15, 1S53.
The heroes of Manila and Santiago and Porto Rico
have made immortal history- They are worthy succes
sors and descendants of "Washington and Greene, of
Paul Jones, Decatur and Hull, and of Grant, Sheridan.
Shorman and Logan; of Farragut, Porter and Cushing;
of Lee. Jackson and Longstreet.â Address at the Trans-
MissiPPippi Exposition at Omaha, Nebraska, October 12,
1S98. .--;.-;Â¦Â¦;
At Bunker Hill liberty was at stake; at Gettysburg
the Union was the issue; before Manila and Santiago our
armies. fought, not for gain or revenge, but for human
rights. They contended for the freedom of the op
pressed, for whose welfare the United States has never
failed to lend a helping hand to establish and uphold,
and, I believe, never will.â Speech at the Auditorium, At
lanta. Georgia, December 15, 189S.
Bryan has been making daily appeals to class antag
onisms and sectional prejudices) but McKinley has ad
dressed himself with patriotic gladness to -the task of
directing attention to the of the country.
As an offset to Bryan note these words:
We have had such a revival of patriotism in this
country as we have never had since the earliest days
in our history- For the first time for more than half
a century. North and South are united in holy alliance,
with one aim, with one purpose, and with one determin
ationâto stand by the Government of the United States.
That is what the war has done for the people of the
United States. â Speech at Tlpton, Indiana, October 21,
1S9S. -Â¦Â¦
My countrymen, net since the beginning of the agita
tion of the question of slavery has there been such a
common bond in name and purpose, such ' genuine
affection, euch a unity of the sections, such obliteration
of party and geographical divisions. National pride
has been again enthroned; national patriotism has been
restored; the national Union cemented closer- and
stronger: the love for the old flag enshrined in all
hearts. North and South have mingled their best blood
in a common cause, and to-day rejoice in a common
victory. Happily for the nation to-day, they follow the
same glorious banner, together fightings and dying under
its sacre<i folds for American honor and for the human
ity of the race.â Speech in the Coliseum, St. Louis, Mls-
Bouri, October 14, 1SSS.
Calamity and disaster, present or to come, are all
that Bryan finds to talk about. McKinley has noted
other things. Compare these words with Bryan's:
We have srown from a little more than three minions
of people to seventy-five millions. We have become the
greatest agricultural and manufacturing- nation of the
world. We have been making progress at rapid strides
!n all the arts of peace. We have a nation from whose
history we need not turn away. We can study it with
pride and profit. We can look back without regret* or
humiliation and forward with hope and confidence.â
Speech at Clinton, Illinois, October 15, 1S9S.
We are a mo*t fortunate people. "We not only have
a revival of patriotism among: the people, but. we have
a ireturn of prosperity to"; the . Our; business

ship Sprinpbartk during her run
from Newcaatlej N. S. W.I to San
Franclpco. For days it looked as though
she would never get c.n an even keel
again, and then for weeks it seemed as
if Ehe could never be w&rped off the
reef. Still Captnln Hoyd ami his men
persevered, and finally the ship was got
Jnto drep water atrain. There was twen
ty-t/ree feet of water in the forppeak and
two feet of water under the main hatch,
but the collision bulkheads heid and the
ship was saved.
"i'he Springbank left Newcastle, N. S.
W., on July 26, with 38SO tons of coal."
said Captain boyd yesterday. "We had
fine weather until August 8. when we wero
in latitude 'a uegre<-3 13 minutes south,
longjiuae 174 uegrees 8 minutes east,
'intie a terrific hiuijcane struck us and
thiew the fepnugiianK on her Beam ends,
'i tie cargo BuUtcd to port and tor twelve
aa>s -vst wallowed in mo trougn of the
bÂ£tt.
"in cider to get the ship before the
wino. we had to cut away tne sneeis and
h&ostus and tvtn then we nau a terriDie
time ot it setting the ship oil an even
Keel, big seus made clean breecries over
her and tlie cabin ana forecastle were
gutted, wnne the cook was wasned out
of the gauey. and for nearly a week we
haa to tat canned meat and hard tack.
"On August 24 we crossed the equator
and had lair weather for several week3.
"On September 11 In latitude 'Jo degrees
3 minutes north, longitucie U'i degrees 45
minutes west, the snip ran on a reef.
A. lien I gat oK acck we were bard and
fast and the cnances seemeu against us
ever getting oil. When I could make an
obserxation I found we were on Ltsiansky
Island, a small coral aftair discovered by
a captain in the Russian navy and named
after him. It Is al-out six miies In cir
cumference and stands up about forty
feet out of the waier. It is overgrown
with grass and is encircled by a reof
which on the west side torus a lagoon
two and a half miles wide In which tnere
is good anchorage. Near the south end
of the Island there is a basin which was
once a lagoon. Now it is overrun with
weeds ana is gradually filling up.
"There is a plentiful supply of fresh
Â¦water to be secured by digging a few feet,
and birds, fish, sea fowl ana turtles are
there, in thousands. The men caught the
fish, birds and turtles with ease and wo
fared* well during our stay on Lisianskv
Island.
"When I found what a predicament we
were In I at once brpan to lighten the
ship forward. Wo jettisoned 415 tons of
coal and then after fifteen days of heav
ing and hauling we got her out through
the channel and into deep . water. If
seamed that as soon as we got on" one reef
we were hard and fast on another. Once
re were able to make sail again the
pumps were sounded and I founo twenty
three feet of water in the forepeak.
I-uckly the collision bulkhead held and
as the coal had all been taken from the
forward part of the ship we made fairly
good progress. Once away from Lisian
sky Islfinu we had strong northwest to
southvest v.-lnds and made a good run to
San Francisco. We will discharge our
coal cargo as soon as possible and will
then go on the 1'nfon Iron Works dry
dock for an overhauling."
The Springbank Is anchored off Meiggs
â¢wharf and does not show anv traces of
the struggles she has been through. She
is weather-beaten, but then so is every
â¢hip that makes port after an eighty-eight
day run. Tne chances are. however 1 , that
many of her plates are sprung and it will
cost considerable to repair her.

up of the Maine, when the country could no
longer hesitate in honor. The events that fol
lowed fully demonstrated the wisdom of Presi
dent McKlnley.
The people of the. United States do not yet
fully appreciate the greatness of President Mc-
Kinley. Take the Chinese problem. Can any
one say that from the Inception of the trouble
in China the President has made a single mis
take? And you may be sure the Bryanites were
watching for mistakes.
Bryan Responsible.
You all know Bryan's record on the acquisi
tion of our new possessions. The treaty of
peace hung In the balance. It lacked seven
teen votes for Us acceptance. Bryan in the
army had been imbued with the Ideas of young
Americans. He knew that no party responsible
for the defeat of the treaty could hope for suc
cess at the polls. He hurried to Washington
and by his Influence secured the acceptance of
the treaty which, as he knew, gave us sov
ereignty In Porto Rico, Cuba and the Philip
pines. And don't you lose sight of the fact
that we will protect that sovereignty.
Mr. Bryan talks a great deal about the con
sent of the governed. In the South the people
whose ancestors have lived there for genera
tions are notÂ» allowed the franchise, and.
Bryan's supporters there urged him to stop
talkiri on that line, for they were not allow
in- tne "niggers" the right to vote. The
"consent of the Â¦ governed" is not enjoyed by
thn black men of the South.
Now Bryan has taken up a new Issue, and
talks of the intimidation of worklngmen. The
next step with him will be over the abyss for
ever. Xo one can' ever win by constant re
treat. There are as many patriotic Democrats
in l(K>0 as there were In 1861. As Don M. Dick
inson says, we will not haul down the flag In
the Philippines so long a3 there are traitors
flrlne upon It.
I wonder if Mr. Bryan thinks he can estab
lish a firm Â»nd stable government in tho Phil
lrrlnes. where the people know nothing, of
civil covernment. In five minutes? ,He ls-go
in$r, without their consent, to establish a pro
tectorate. But what a mess he would make of
it. to withdraw our army and navy from. the
Philippines, leaving in full charge," with our
Government responsible for his acts, the man
who planned tho massacre of every man,
woman and child In Manila except the people
of his own tribe. Who Is this Aguinaldo, whom
they have dubbed the George Washington of
the Philippines? I presume Bryan in his cor
respondence has addressed him as George,
v.'ashlnzton Aguinaldo. Xow this man Is the
same who, in the revolt against Spain, sold
out for $6CO.0OO in Spanish gold.
I ask you, whatever may have been your
r>oHtics does Mr. Bryan's position appeal to
the reason of a single man here? We have a
title to the Philippines, sealed with the blood
oi our sons.
What the Future Holds.
The acaulsltion of the Philippines places us
nearer to the Orient than any nation of the
world. Looking to the Orient, "Jim" Hill Is
building six 22,000-ton ships and many smaller
ones are being constructed, to meet the prrow
lner commerce of the Pacific. The march of
the world's financial center Is westward. San
Francisco Is a geographical center, and young
men here will see It dominating the commerce
of the world. A few years ago Mr. Scott be
can buildinc 'ships here. A few years more
and there will be twenty shipyards building
ships here, and all will bless Mr. Scott for his
enterprise and courage.
President McKlnley Is the right man In the
rlsht place and on the 6th of November you
will re-elect him by a majority that will for
ever bury the heresies of Bryanlsm.

Quintet E. I. Wolfe, candidate for State

The applause accorded the Congressman
amounted to an ovation, and It was sev
eral minutes before Mr. Loud could pro

Ovation for Loud.

the Republican party are for the best In

no gainsaying the splendid executive
power in thu Republican party as man
ifestf-d in the progress of America during
the last thirty years.
"We have upon the platform to-night a
Congressman who is a Republican first,
lust and all the time. He has no personal
ambitions or animosities that put him out
of touch with the party. Every worthy
measure receives his support and the peo
ple have shown their gratitude by elect
ing him five times and will show it again
by electing him next month for a sixth
time. It is with pleasure tha.t I introduce
Eugene F. IÂ»ud."
Gustave Gunzendorfer, president of the
Thirty-seventh District Republican Club,
called the meeting to order and introduced
Irving M. Scott as chairman of the even
ing-. When the applause which greeted
Mr. Scott had subsided he spoke as fol
lows:
The large hall was filled, upstairs and
down; the aisles were crowded full and
hundreds were turned away. Enthusiasm
was at a hlgrh pitch and Congressman

Let us go back and recall some history from
the fall of 1S97, when Democrats In Congress
were clamoring for war. Two strong men, the
President and the Speaker of the House, op
josed war. There was not a second shot In the
locker. Xever was a country more illy pre
pared for war than the United States. Day
by day this clamor continued until the blowing
He went to Hawaii and executed his orders
there and hauled down the flag. He came back
to this country and retired to his plantation In
Georgia, and there is no one now to do him
honor. Mr. Bryan has come to appreciate that
lesson and has ceased to talk about hauling
down the flar.
There was once a gentleman known as "Para
mount" Blount who hauled down the flag In
Hawaii. Who was Mr. Blount? A man head
anil shoulders above Mr. Bryan â a man who
had served In Congress for twenty years and
when he retired in 1S35 both sides in the
House united In paying him honor.
Mr. Bryan promises If elected at once to haul
down the flag and withdraw the army from thÂ»
Philippines: He has not considered the fact
that a IÂ»resldent has no power to cede away
any part of territory once acquired by the
Trlted States. He mljht Just as well cede
California hack to Mexico.
No one In this country wants an imperialis
tic zovernment. Imperialism cannot exist In
any country that has a schoolhouse on every
hilltop. The progress of every government is
Rway from imperialism, and toward greater
freedom for the people. Mr. Bryan seeks to
blind the eyes of the people with a phantom
that has no existence and never can have.
Imperialism Impossible.
If the Bryanistic party stands for anything.
It stands for free trade and free sliver. You
all know how Mr. Bryan insisted that free
roina^e cf silver should be fpeclflcally reaf
firmed by the Kansas City Convention. Wiser
men in the party had insisted that a new issus
was necessary if the party hoped to win. In
1S^6 free coinage was a new Issue. It carried
the people oft their feet for the time. I came
home to San Jose and found the people stand
ing about the streetsâ they had nothing else to
do â shouting for Bryan and free silver, but
reason prevailed and on election day the Re
publican majority was three times as large as
the usual majority.
The pnees of that dark period following 1S92
are fresh in the memories of all. With Mc-
Klnlpy's administration the country has sprung
up from the depths of the nlgut to the very
pinnacle of Its progress. ,
Tbe best index to the prosperity of a coun
try is Its accumulated wealth. We had been
borrowing money from Europe, until this ad
ministration, and now we are lending money
to Kurope. New York has become the finan
cial center of the world. The balance of trade
In our favor In the last three years has
amounted to J1.700,(rtX>,000. Until 1S37 London
waÂ« the financial center of the world. â¢ Now

In order to show their interest In the;
fight for better hours and salaries the
linemen of the, Independent Order of Elec
trical Workers, Local 6, San Francisco,
formed a special organization among
themselves. They will now demand the $3i
per diem salary and eight hours. The only
company which has . acceded to these
terms, the standard wages and hours of
employment, is the Independent Electric
Light and Power Company. â¢
While | perfecting their organization the
local" linemen claim they were spied upon
by detectives and the names of all those
Interested in the organization thus came
to the manager of the telephone company.
The result was the dismissal of Robert
Gale. -inspector of East office, on Sutter
and Hyde streets. All the men under him
were transferred to the main, office and
lowered in Uheir class of work.
The meeting of the linemen occurred on
October 15. On the 16th the .dismissal was
announced. Last Saturday J. A. McGin
ley and several others were, discharged. "
John I. Sabin . has given . out ; In one
breath that curtailment of expenses was
the reason , for the dismissal, and in an
other, according, to the linemen, that he
will reinstate the discharged. employes as
soon as the linemen of Los Angeles and
this city giveup the idea of a strike or
the adoption . of means to ; secure better
hours and a greater compensation for
their work.
The present discontent emanates from
the difficulties which the Los Angeles
linemen experienced In their contentions
with the company about a month ago.
The linemen of the Independent Order of
Electrical ; Workers of America, Local 61,
Los Angeles, thought they were not suffi
ciently recompensed for their labor and
they sent a committee to call upon Man
ager Hinchcliffe. He would not even
grant them a hearing. All the satisfaction
obtainable from' Hinchcliffe was the Infor
mation that John I. Sabin was running
tho company and not the employes.
The Pacific States Telephone Company,
of which John I. Sabin Is the president
and general manager, will in all probabil
ity be face to face, In a very short time,
with a general strike on' the part of the
linemen. Although no demands have as
yet been made by the linemen, who have
formed a special protective organization,
they will within a few days ask for con
cessions from the telephone company. In
stead of $2 50 a day they will demand $3,
and they will also demand that their
work be shortened from ten hours to
eight hours.

Speaking to Assemblymen, Dibble
Confesses to Spending $1800
to Secure an Election to
the Legislature.
ASSEMBLYMAN JOHN FAIRWEATHER made a disclosure at a publlo
meeting In this city last night that will produce a profound sensation
In the Forty-first Assembly District. Mr. Falrweather served In tha
Legislature with Dibble, In relating an Incident of the last regular tes
slon he said:
"I am somewhat acquainted with. Mr. 3>ibble, having served
with him 'in the last regular session at Sacram-ento. When the pur- â¢
ity of election bill was under discussion at that session Mr. John- ;
son, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was opposing the bill, â¢
when Mr. Dibble arose in his place and spoke, saying that he ',
hoped the bill would pass, as under the existing conditions his ]
election to the Assembly had cost him $1800 in one campaign. Mr.
Johnson expressed surprise at the statement and remarked that his
objections would cease. We were all astounded, wondering how
any man should want an office so bad that he would spend nearly
four times the salary of the position to obtain it. There must be
'something rotten in Denmark' when such things are done. The
pay. of the office is only $480. Including mileage it i3 about $500.
Bid, Mr. Dibble expect something on the side in addition to his
salary? If Mr. Dibble did not pay the $1800 from his own means,
would not those who did pay it expect to be reimbursed?"
The citizens of the Fofty-first Assembly District should givÂ« serious consid
eration to the foregoing statement. H. C. Dibble acknowledged, openly that
he expended J1S0O to secure an office worth legitimately only $3C0. The ready In
ference Ts that the bosses and corporations put up the money for bis election
expenses and In return ho was expected to represent the corporations on the
floor of the Assembly.
Let the voters ask themselves how it happens that Dlbbla can afford to pay
$1800 for an election to serve one term of sixty days in the Assembly? Tho
Qa'll is of the opinion that Dibble la tho agent of the Southern Pacific corpora
tion in the Assembly, and that the company makes good his campaign expenses
and permits him to engage In waste basket transactions and oil pipe line nego
tiations with Bruner and others on the side. His presence In tha Legislature la
a disgrace to the good people oi the Forty-first District.
The argument is advanced by weak and timid Republicans that his services
are needed by the Republican party In the preparation of a measure to re
apportlon the State. There Is not the slightest danger that an apportionment
unfair to the Republican party will be seriously considered. In the Senate the
Republicans have fifteen of the hold-over Senators and will probably elect four
teen of the twenty. new Senators. Dibble never was of any service to the party
or the people on legislative measures pertaining to apportionment. To serve his
own political ends he twisted the Congressional districts Into peculiar shape,
but was never able to get a nomination for Congress,
Two years ago Dibble received a majority of 855. He is counting now on
receiving 60 per cent of the large Republican vote of the district, but he will
not get that percentage. He will be iefeated If the bosses do not rally Demo
crats to his support. :'".'-Â¦'
1 The Call seeks to be fair and Just In Its Indorsement of legislative nominees.
Dibble is opposed because he is an unworthy politician, and because his election
would reflect discredit on the people of the Forty-first Assembly District. Injure
the cause of good government and harm the Republican party. The bosses
would not put him forward as a candidate In a doubtful or close district, but
they count on pulling him through by reason of the popularity of the national
ticket and the heavy Republican majority of the district.
Republicans are under no obligations, political or otherwise, to support Dib
ble. He is not the nominee of the party, as the Supreme Court In overthrow
ing the primary election law gave control of the nominating conventions to the
bosses. It is a known fact that among Democrats who went to the primary
polls and voted the Dibble ticket was one who subsequently served as a dele
gate In the Democratic local convention. It Is clearly the duty of every good
Republican in the district to work against Dibble and vote against him. The
Call Is gratified to learn that hundreds of leading Republicans have openly
announced their Intention to vote for Oscar Sutro. the nominee of the Citizens'
Republican party. This journal entertains no feeling of malice In opposing
Dibble. â¢ There are no unsettled scores to adjust. The opposition to him is baseU
wholly on, the fact that he is not a fit man for service in the Legislature-
that he la the agent of the bosses and the chattel of corporations.

UNPRECEDENTED RUSH

The war of the Spanish succession,- with
which the eighteenth century opened, 13
the most important case in all history of i
a contested will. No other such estate
has ever been bequeathed by its dying and
childless owner, for the domains of .Charles
II in 1700 comprised the Spanish peninsula
except Portugal, the kingdoms of Xaple*
-and Sicily, the island of Sardinia, por
tions of Tuscany and the Milanese in Ita
ly, the Spanish Netherlands (approximate
ly the Belgium of to-day), the Canary Isl
ands and Ceuta in Africa, all N'orrh Amer
ica save the English colonies, Canada and
Louisiana, Mexico, Central America and
all of South America except Brazil. Cuba,
Porto Rico and San Domingo In the West
Indies, and on the other side of the globe
the Carolines and Philippines. No wonder
Louis XIV, the Emperor and the two
maritime powers, England and the Neth
erlands, felt that 'national safety as well
as future greatness - were â¢ at stake- when
such an Inheritance was to be .divided, or
that all the resources of peaceful negotia
tion were strained to the utmost to effect
an amicable division as Charles of Spain
approached tho grave. It will help us to
understand the situation if we compare
the attitude of; tne .powers - toward de
crepit China or remember how many of
us exulted when the last relics of that
vast Spanish empire came into our posses
sion two years ago.
The rival heirs to the throne of Spain
in 16S8 were Philip, the grandson of Louts
XIV, and Maria Theresa, eldest sister of
Charles II of Spain, and Joseph, the son
of the Elector of Bavaria and grandson
of the Emperor Leopold and of the young
er sister of Charles II. A less direct can
didate was Charles, Archduke of Austria,
younger eon of the Emperor and great
grandson of Philip III of Spain. Tho ac
cession of Louis' grandson to the throne
would mean a family alliance of Franco
and Spain, and possibly a union, while the
accession of either a son or a grandson of
the Emperor might lead to a reunion of
Austria and Spain, as under Charles V.
In any case England and Holland felt
they were deeply concerned. To avoid
war William III, ruler of England and tho
Netherlands, agreed with Louis XIV in
169S that his grandson Philip should have
the Italian possessions except the Mila
nese, Sardinia and the province of Gulpus
coa in Northern Spain, and the Archduke
should have the Milanese, and that the
little Electoral Prince Joseph should have
Spain, the Spanish Netherlands and the
Indies (America). Hardly had this ar
rangement been agreed upon when the
death of the Electoral Prince unsettled
everything. Painful negotiation brought
about a new partition treaty in March,
1700, by which the Archduke Charles was
to take what had been allotted to Joseph
and his own share was transferred to
Louis' grandson, Philip, who retained his
Ehare as granted by the first treaty. With
in six months Charles of Spain took mat
ters into his own hands, and by will be
stowed all his possessions on Philip. A
month later tie died, and Louis XIV ac
cepted the bequest.
If Louis had gone no further Europe
would have acquiesced, for there was lit
tle popular opposition in England to the
will, but with an Imprudence difficult of
explanation he roused the opposition of
the Dutch by expelling their troops from
the "barrier fortresses" in the Spanish
Netherlands and substituting troops of
his own. He kindled English indignation
by recognizing the son of the exiled James
II as King of England, and alarmed
Europe by announcing that his grandson,
in becoming King of Spain, had not im
paired his chance of succeeding to the
throne of France.
This declaration of policy called Into
existence in 1701 the grand alliance of
England. Holland and the Emperor, with
the professed" object of securing for the
Emperor reasonable and Just satisfaction
for his family claim to the Spanish suc
cession and for England and Holland pro
tection for their possessions, commerce
and navigation. If peaceful means should
fail the alliance would try to get hold of
the Spanish Netherlands ana separate
them from France as a defense to Hol
land, and to secure for the Emperor the
duchy of Milan, the kingdoms of Naples
and Sicily and the mainlands and islands
of Tuscany, which were to be open to
English and Dutch commerce. England
and Holland on their part were authorized
for the promotion of their trade and navi
gation to occupy any lands and cities they
could in Spanish America and to keep
them.
The attainment of these objects cost a
European war of more than ten years'
duratfen. which may be described as the
first great war for trade, for In it the com
mercial motive was dominant. The rising
capitalist class expected to get rich from
it. Bonnet, the Brandenburg envoy, wrote
from London: "People here don't care
who is king of. Spain as long as English
trade doesn't suffer."^
The results of this European struggle
The advance of England after the Span
ish succession war to the firat place In
Europe not only gave an Immense Impetus
to her commercial development but con
ferred upon her In some respects the place
of leader In the Intellectual life of the day.
The achievements on land and sea of her
people awakened French curiosity as to
English politics and ideas. Religious tol
eration, civil liberty, freedom o! thought
and self-government almost for the first
time attracted the respectful attention
and consideration of the first mlnd3 of
France. As conditions of national great
ness they must be looked into, and this
opened the door for spreading the Idea
that they were not only conditions of na
tional greatness but fundamental human
rights.
Voltaire expounded the philosophy of
Newton and John Locke to Europe and
dwelt with admiration on the comfort and
happiness diffused by English liberty,
while Montesquieu deduced from the ac
tual principles and practice of the Eng
lish constitution the fundamental charac
teristics and conditions of a free govern
ment. Never had English Ideas exercised
so great an influence on European thought
as during the eighteenth century.
There were, on the other hand, evil con
sequences of England's triumph in a war
for commerce. The lack of an elevating
religious or moral ideal as the aim of the
conflict inevitably lowered the national
standard?. "Nothing." says Sir John See-
I ley, "had ever so secularized and mate
rialized the English people before. Never
were sordid motives so supreme, never
was religion and every high Influence so
much discredited, as In the thirty years
that followed."
One finds these baleful results Illustrat
ed in the energetic development .with un
troubled conscience of the African slave
trade, in the routrh and brutal sports, and
in a diffusion of political corruption so
general that Alexander Hamilton came to
look upon It as an essential feature of the
English system. It Is not without signifi
cance that It was from this age and at
mosphere that there soon came the most
biting and ruthless satire on mankind
that was ever written, the "Travels Into
I Several Remote Nations of the World."

Among the minor changes of the next
few years .may be noted the advantageous
exchange between the Emperor and the

which both gave up an isolated possession

house of Savoy was to be King of Sar

1A/AR GEOGRAPHY OP EUROPE.
DIVIDING THE INHERITANCE OF SPAIN.
Police Find Many Weak Points in Alleged Hold-Up and the
Seizure of Fifteen Hundred Dollars Which Chinese *
Claim Occurred in Club at Globe Hotel.
The. discovery was made during the ses
sion of the Supervisors' Street Committee
yesterday that many owners' of property
on streets which were accepted prior to
October 9. 1S71, had been put to the ex
pense of keeping their sidewalks . In, re
pair, .though the city Is legally, bound to
do the work. The information that prop
erty owners were paying for repairs that
6hould,bÂ« borne by the city was divulged
by Chief Deputy Donovan of the. Bureau
of Streets when the committee took up the
petition of F. O. Heydenfeldt that the city
repair the sidewalk !n front of his prem
ises on Folsom street, between Third and
Fourth. This block was accepted on
May 7, 1SSS, and therefore should be kept
In good condition by the city. Donovan
reported that Heydenfeldt had become
impatient at the long- delays to which his
petition had been subjected, and he had
repaved the sidewalk at his own expense.
"The city should do the repairing," 6aid
Donovan, "and Heydenfeldt Is not the
only property owner who has been forced
to relay sidewalks that were -accepted
prior to October, 1&71. A large number of
property owners similarly situated , have
done so in the past either, from Ignorance
of the law or because they became Impa
tient at the city's delay."
Many thousands of dollars have been
paid out by property owners . which
the city is liable for. Donovan explained
that prior to October, 1871, streets were
accepted without reference to any par
ticular portion of a block, the name of
the street and the streets between which
the same was accented being named. It
was claimed that the acceptance in that
manner Included not alone the roadway
but the sidewalksâ that is, the entire
width of the streetâ and that the ex
pense of keeping the same improved and
in repair devolved upon the city. After
October 9, 1871. in order to avoid any
question thereafter being raised as to the
action of the Board of Supervisors In re
lation to the extent of the acceptance of
a street the resolutions adopted simply
provided for the acceptance of the road
way of the street and the practice has
since been observed.
The question of thVllablllty of the city
and county for the expense of repairing
and keeping improved the sidewalks
claimed to be accepted was determined
in the" case of Phelan against the city
and county of San Francisco. A decision
was rendered by the Supreme Court and
filed November 14, 18S2, In which the judg
ment and order of the lower court maklns;
the city and county liable for the cost of
the construction of sidewalks on Howard
street from First to Third was affirmed.
This doctrine was reaffirmed In -the case
of B. Bonnet against the city and county
of San Francisco, 65 Cal. Rep., 230, and
also in Parker against the city and county
of San Francisco, 2 West Coast Reporter,
S78.
The fact that the law Is not generally
known on the subject has been the cause
of saddling the expense of repairing such
accepted streets upon the property own
ers, though the city is legally obligated
tojpay for it.
The streets and sidewalks accepted prior
to October 9, 1871, which the city and not
the property owners must keep in repair
include most of the blocks in the down
town districts, their dates of acceptance
being kept on file in the Street Bureau.
Donovan, however, contends "that If the
sidewalk is of the same material used
Erior to 1871 the city Is liable for its repair,
ut If a new sidewalk has since been con
structed by the owner the city Is not now
lKTble for its maintenance.
The Street Committee recommended the
passage of an ordinance declaring a strip
of land which would be an extension of
Fifth avenue from Lake street north to
be an open public street. The B<?ard of
Public Works presented a deed to the land
signed, by W. H. Buckles and his wife.
The petition of property owners and mer
chants for the paving of Fourth street
from Howard to Harrison, with bitumen
instead of basalt blocks was reported upon
adverselv.
An ordinance providing for the full ac
ceptance of Mariposa street between Flor
ida and Bryant was ordered to be pre
pared.
Several protestants appeared in opposi
tion to the building of a sewer on An
dover and Crescent avenues which has
been ordered by the Board of Public
-Works, and the committee decided to
view the district named to settle the dis
pute.
A petition, signed by 1000 property own
ers, was filed with the Board of Supervis
ors requesting that $30,000 be set aside for
a new pavement for Bush street. The
petition recites that the bad condition of
the street Is well known and it has been
growing worse, there having been little
or no repairs made for ten years past.

VALUE OF CREAM
As Compared With Meat.
One of the most valuable items In one's
dietary Is rood, rich cream. The remark
1* frequently made that "cream is too ex-
pensive to use freely." Such people think
they must have meat every day at 10 and
Â£5 cents per pound and do not realize
that 5 cents* worth of pure cream for
breakfast will do more to put on flesh
than 23 or 30 cents' worth of meat. An
Ideal portion of breakfast Is that obtained
from, eay. four teaspoons of Grape-Nuts
and a little pure, thick cream. This is one
of the mos-t delicious dishes Imaginable
and Is served without cooking or trouble ;
of any kind and cannot be, equaled In
j/olnt of food value for the human bod/.
The Grape-Nuts, consisting largely â¢ of
rr&pe sugar, have passed through pro-
cesses similar to the first act of digestion
and are therefore most easily : digested,
and in combination with cream, they ren-
der the cream itself easy of digestion. -
Orvctr* veil Grape-Nuts^

NEW YORK. Oct. 25.â Accordine to the
phrase cf the professional traders in stocks a
reaction in prices was theoretically due to
day. The reaction was strenuously resisted
by the bull element, but their efforts proved
futile and ;>rlces chow losses on the day. A
fudden break in Sugar in the final hour had
not a little to do with the decisive course of
the market downward. Sugar suffered from
very heavy liquidation after its recent tharp
rise, which was not accounted for by any
news. Today's break was equally without
explanation but the fact of a previous rise

due proems of time. To-day's disposition to

thowed a decline, as had been expected, re
ceipts being liberal and the weather still en
gaged in helping thd>*farmer get his grain to
j n.jirktt. There was a large short Interest here
and in the Northwest and it was alarmed over
the hfavy cash sales here yesterday, news of
which was not announced until the da?'s trad
ing was over. Liverpool recovered most of the
! curly loss. The Northwest sold moderately
early, but bought some also, and later was
principally en the purchasing side of the
pit. December, without any material reaction,
dosplte some profit taking, advanced to 7?%o,
at which the market closed. T4@lc over yester
dty.

the wheat strength was too strenuous to be
overlooked. December closed He hightr at
3,-iVj.c

Provisions were fairly active and flrm. The
n:Â£.rket started higher on moderate hog | re
ceipts and an advance In prices at the yards.

NEW YORK, Oct. 25.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Heaviness and dullness characterized the mar
kets here to-day. Induced by fears of higher
rates for money. Americans were much quieter
than they have been recently, and London was
unsettled and Inclined to continue realizing
rales, fearing that the manipulators in New
York will unload before the election. The bank
lost Â£20,D00 gold to Holland. Money was tighter,
mainly owing to the settlements and end of
month arrangements, while the bank was re
ported to be borrowing to harden the market.
A stronger measure than this will be required
to accomplish that object.

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEATâ Liverpool was lower, but Paris and
New York were higher. Chicago was also firm
er, under light offerings and better cablea.
There was fair investment buytoig, and the
seaboard reported a strong market. There were
850.000 bushels sold at Chicago. The shorts be
gan to cover on reports of fly in Ohio, Indiana
and Missouri. The recent decline Is ascribed
to the- big Kansas crop, but it Is thought re
ceipts will now fair off. In which case better
prices may result. Argentine advices are un
favorable.
In this market the feeling was strong, and
both eoot and future prices advanced.

lectures for the Benefit of the Wom
â¢an's Educational and Indus
. trial Union.
The entertainment last night for the
benefit of the Woman's Educational and
Industrial Union of San Francisco at the
Young Men's Christian Association Hall
netted a snug sum for the society. The
feature of the evening's programme was a
lecture by Chinese Consul Ho Yow. He
spoke on the subject of "The Education
and Industry of China," and the audience
was greatly entertained with his descrip
tion of the manner of living and the
methods of education pursued by the peo
ple of his nation.
"The education of the average Chinese,"
said the Consul, "commences at the age
of five years. He Is taught the proverbs
and sayings of Confucius principally, and
a small knowledge of the Chinese lan
guage. It would require such a length of
time to acquire a thorough knowledge of
the Chinese literature that but few out
side of the wealthiest class are able to
pursue the course to completion, and
after a few years' schooling they gener
ally branch out as tradesmen or mer
chants."
In speaking of the Industries of his
country the speaker mentioned as the
principal ones fishing, wood and stone
carving and the weaving of costly fabrics.
In these pursuits his countrymen | were
greatly handicapped by the absence of
machinery, he said, all the specimens of
this work seen in this country and else
where having been turned out entirely by
hand.
The lecture of the Consul ended with
the wish on his part that the commercial
interests of this country be kept in touch
with those of his own.
Following the speech of Ho Tow a pleas
ant proRTamme was rendered. Miss Jean
nette Wollner and Miss Florence Lipscher
performed on the violin and piano and
received several encores. Miss Eleanor
Haber in a clever manner told the misfor
tunes attending her first public appear
ance, and in answer to the applause that
greeted her efforts recited several short
humorous selection?. A song by James B.
Dougherty, accompanied by Mrs. Dr.
Kemp Van Ee. was greatly appreciated
by the audience.

THE DAY'S DEAD.
LONDON. Oct. 25.â Sims Reeves, the
great tenor, who had been confined to his
bed since Monday with bronchitis, died
to-day wjjlle asleep.
John Sims Reeves was born at Shooter's
Hill, Kent. October 21. 1S22. and was first
instructed by his father. At an early age
he held the appointment of organist and
director of the choir at the church of
North Cray, and after taking lessons on
the pianoforte from J. B. Cramer he waa
placed under the care of T. Cooke, Hobbs,
and other distinguished professors of sing
ing. In December, 1S39, he made his first
appearance on the stage at Newcastle, at
which time he was singing barytone
parts: he next visited the principal pro
vincial (owns, and went to Paris to study
his profession.
Not long afterward he made his flrst
appearance in Italian opera at LÂ«a Scala,
Milan, in the tenor part of Edgardo In
"Lucia di Lammermoor." and came out tn
the same character at Drury Lane Thea
ter, December 6, 1S17, then under the man
agement of tlw late M. Jullien.* His tirst
original character was in Balfe's opera of
the "Maid of Honor." and he appeared at
Her Majesty's Theater as Carlo in "Linda
di Chamuunl" in 1S4K, and was engaged at
the Itoyal Italian Opera, at Covent Gar
den, In 1343. Since that time Mr. Reeves
has appeared at all the great perform
ances of oratorios at Exeter Hall, the pro
vincial festival and at the Crystal Palace.
One of his best original parts was In
Macfarren's opera of "Robin Hood," pro
duced at the performances of English
opera at her Majesty's Theater, in 1860.
Mr. Sims Reeves made strenuous efforts
to reduce the present high pitch to that
of the normal diapason. He recently
completed his "Jubilee" and a book set
ting forth some interesting events In his
long and successful career. He made his
farewell of the public at the Albert Hall,
on May 11, 1S91. when Madame Christine
Nilsson went over expressly to assist on
this memorable occasion. Mr. Sims
Reeves married Miss Emma Lucombe, a
soprano singer. His son. Herbert, 13 a

the water company.
Judge Hart denied the motion, but said
it would be good if proof were made that
Boardman had taken facts to which he
had testified from the books of the com
pany.
â¢ Then the weary grind of question and
answer was resumed. The smallest de
tail of construction cost was probed for.
By 4 o'clock Boardman showed percepti
ble signs of mental fatigue, and In order
not to weary him too much an adjourn
ment waa taken until 9 o'clock to-morrow
morning. The attorneys have at least
two weeks if not much longer ahead of
them for digging into the construction ac
counts of the company. Besides all of the
technical work from the engineers, there
Is a mass of data, of more or less value
which has been collected by the city's ex
pert accountants. It is understood, how
ever, that the destruction of the books of
the company, has been a Berious bar to
the Investigation the city has tried to
make concerning the real, value of the
Pl One of the big fights of the trial will
come when the Contra Costa Company
attempts to record evidence about the cost
of the absorbed DIngee Company. The
city'e claim is that it cannot be considered
as a part of the operating plant neces
garv to the supplying of Oakland with
water.
Judge Hart said the city was entitled to
learn how Boardman reached his conclu
sions.
The water company's counsel was anx
ious to prevent Hayne from pursuing his
minute inquiry, but the attorney was al
lowed to proceed, after Boardman had
been temporarily withdrawn to rest.
Hayne etarted to introduce the annual
statements of the Contra Costa Water
Company to the city, but held that fea
ture up for a time.
Hayne moved to strike, out all of Board-"
man's testimony, based upon his report of
1&S6, upon the ground that the report was
not tihown to the city experts. He con
tended that this record was included
within the order of Judge Hart, which di
rected the water company to show Us
books.
The effort of the city's representative to
get at itemized details considerably con
fused Boardman. who at last declared,
after many admissions, that he" could not
answer Hayne's questions and that he
could not give items of cost in many par
ticulars.
MeCutehen argued that the city should
only demand general estimates.
On the city's side there have been In
court to date ML K. Miller. G. F. Allardt
and D. C. Henny, engineers. Several oth
ers are Jn reserve, beinÂ£ held to await the
showing which the company may make.
The Boardman details so far show that
the company had spent $1,105,000 on the
Lake Chabot and Temescal reservoirs
prior to 18S6.
The water company has lined- up Klcr
eted of Kansas City, Schuyler and Adams
from Ixjs Angeles and Louis Le Conic,
besides Boardman and F. M. Hewson, all
engineers. Hewson was in charge of the
company's construction department for
several years.
All day the water company's attorneys,
coached by their expert engineers, plied
W. F. Boardman. the aged surveyor who
constructed Lake Chabot dam, with ques
tions, and when they had exhausted him
the venerable engineer was turned over to
Mr. Hayne. who started a vigorous cross
examination. Naturally enough, the old
engineer, now past 76 years, could remem
ber littleâ hardly anythingâ of the mass
of items that went to the construction ac
count of the big dam. Hayne objected to
the use of these records, claiming that
they are not original data, but Judge Hart
allowed them to be utilized, so the clty'3
counsel directed that every time the rec
ords were referred to by Boardman note
should be mad? in the stenographic report
of the testimony.
With not less than a dozen civil engi
neers, ranged about equally on each side
of the water rates suit, the trial has be
come a dull, uninteresting record of
minute details of construction, of esti
mates of cost, of most technical Items per
taining to the building of the two great
distributing lakos of the Contra Costa

The Jail, so called. Is a flimsy structure
and Is only used to accommodate petty
offenders. Anderson had been arrested
for causing a disturbance in a Haywards
restaurant and given a fifteen days' sen
tence. The prisoner was to-night trans
ferred to the County Jail in Oakland.
The Haywards jail was not badly dam
aged.
The firemen had to smash open the cell
door to reach the blaze which was started
by Anderson In the pile he had made of
the cell furniture heaped against the door.
The firemen found tho prisoner lying on
the floor waiting for the smoke and flames
that filled the cell to end his life. His
rescue from a wretched death seemed
marvelous. The fact that the fire was
so quickly discovered from the outside
was all that prevented Anderson's incin
eration. After he was dragged out half
conscious and already suffering " from
smoke suffocation, Anderson was revived
He had nothing to say in excuse for his
strange actions, and the town police could
not account for the peculiar attempt at
suicide.
> Charles Anderson, a prisoner in the
Town Jail at Haywards. tried to cremate
himself In his cell at noon to-day. His
effort at self-destruction would have been
successful but for the smoke from tho
pyre that was seen by passing pedes
trians. An alarm summoned the volun
teer fire department to the burning cala
boose, and the structure with Its desper
ate inmate was saved by qlilck work.

OAKLAND, Oct. 23.â The prefer
ment cf the Rev. John Coyle to
the position of presiding elder of
the Oakland district for the
Methodist Episcopal church was
a pleasant surprise to his friends. The
reverend gentleman has labored in the
church for over twenty-five years. He
originally studied to become a physician,
but at the close of his studies he decided
to enter the church. His first pastorate
was in Newark. N. J. He resigned tho

continuously in California. Dr. Coyle suc

n LAMEDA, Oct. 25.â Hon. Victor
w\ H. Metcalf, the Republican nom
jLJk inoe fur Congress In the Third
District, made his first appear
ance in Alameda to-night since
he received the Republican nomination.
There was a tremendous ovation to the
Congressman at the West End. and the
Wlgman was Jammed to the doors to lis
ten to Mr. Metcalf, who has just returned
from the Interior of his district and will
close his campaign by stumping his own
county. Alameda was always a strong
supporter of the Congressman, and the
West End showed its loyalty and enthu
siasm to-night in no measured way.
Philip Klernan. vice president of the
Alameda Republican Club, was chairman
of the meeting. Seated* on the stage were
Assemblyman Joseph R. Knowland, who
made a few well chosen remarks: Judge
A. B. Hunt. Colonel George C. Babcock
and Ralph Hamlln.
Congressman Metcalf dealt with the is
sues of the campaign in a clear, forcible
manner, his logical exposure of Demo
cratic fallacies carrying conviction to hi?
auditors. He said:
I am glad to be again with my Alameda
friends. I have just returned from the north
ern section of the district, which Is regarded
as the stronghold of the enemy. I now feel
that I am In the household of my friends.
While In Colusa County I met a man who had
voted for Cleveland and who tried to sell his
ranch for $600 during Grovcr's second term.
He could not get that price for It. Later he
voted for McKinley and disposed of the ranch
for J1000. That man says he is now coins to
vote for Bryan and if Bryan Is elected he ex
pects to buy the ranch back for $250.
All along the line everything points to the

is overconfldence. I s;Â« to you not to be over

The United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals handed down an opinion yesterday
through Judge Hawley reversing the judg
ment of United States District Judge de
Haven in the matter of James Hindman,
bankrupt. Hindman Is a house and sign
painter, paper hanger and kalsomlner. He
claimed his horse and wagon to be ex
empt from execution, alleging that he
u?ed them In transporting his tools,
paints, ladders, etc.. to and from his work,
and that If he had to pay for the deliv
ery of his tools and material he would
not make any profit. The referee decided
that the horse and wagon were not ex
empt, and Judge de Haven confirmed the
report.
In reversing Judge de Haven the* Court
of Appeals says:
"It is not necessary in order to secure*
exemption of the property that the use of
the team should be the petitioner's only
means of earning a living for himself and
family. It is enough for him to show that
he uses the team as a laborer In a line
of business similar in its character to the
specific occupations named in the statute,
and that such use is necessary In order to
enable him to earn his living."
Judge de Haven Is Reversed by

of Appeals.

landed a swing on his optic, drawing

the flow of blood blinded him. The spec

they learned that hla other "lamp" wa*
useless to him they seemed satisfied. E<1
Devlin and Tommy Warren covered them
selves with gore and presented a horrible

Devlin had a better riarht. Warren had

The patient was resting easily this
evening; but the attending physician de
clares her condition to be critical.
The attack cccurred at noon In front of
W: V. Welle's pickle works at Third and
Lewis streets. "Welle owned the dog,
which was known in the neighborhood as
mean tempered, vicious and extremely
dangerous. The child is the daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. J. Tierra, residing at 717
Lewis street, bhe was passing along
Lewis street on her way home when the
dog suddenly Jumped out of a doorway.
The brute grabbed the girl, after snapping
at her, and caught her by the legs. He
made savage bites, and while the child
was screaming and trying to escape the
dog kept up his attacks, tearing and
mangling the girl from head to feet.
Exhausted from shock, pain and loss of
blood the little victim fell to the side
walk, and lay there Insensible while her
rescuers arrived armed with sticks and
clubs which they had to use with effect
before the dog was dragged away.
The girl was at last freed and then was
hurriedly removed to her home. Dr. W.
W. Kergan was at once summoned. He
pronounced the injuries as extremely
dangerous. In one of the most serious
lacerations the surgeon was compelled to
take twenty-seven stitches to close the
ugly wounds.
The girl'3 body and arms were also bad
ly Injured, but not so severely as her
legs. The surgeons will have to resort to

"WASHINGTON. Oct. 25.â The Secretary
of the Treasury, acting on the decision of
the Solicitor of the Treasury, has held
that the wife of a Chinese native born
citizen of the United States Is entitled to
admission Into the United States regard
less of the provisions of section 19S4
Revised Statutes. Such right to land does
not depend on the status of her husband
as a merchant, even if it is held that
the exclusion laws apply to a Chinese
merchant who is native born, but rather
on her higher right not to be separated
from her husband, who is legally entitled
to live In the country of hla birth.

comes to Bausbach naturally, as he has
already proved himself an able field gen
eral and one of the best all-round players
in the freshman class. Upon him more
than upon any other man depends the
outcome bt next Saturday's contest with
Berkeley, and it is expected that he will
be able to captain his men to victory

P. Jones' Wedgewood did clever work
throughout tha midweek reserve stake
yesterday at Union Park and finished up
the * day's work by easily beating Maher
& Reid's Bad**Boy In thÂ© deciding course.
The young- dog showed / in the greatest
form and beat his opponents strictly on
merit. Had "VVedgewood displayed such
good condition in the big event on Sun
day last he would have certainly made
the going interesting for the last dogs In
the stake.
Bad Boy, the runner-up, also ran well.
Pikers had a great day of it, no less
than seventeen short-ends helping to swell
their bank rolls and at moie than fai*
odds.
One of the /surprises, or rather two of
them, were furnished by Kavanaugh'*
Hard Lines. Handicapped by .a Seattla
record as champion - Hard Lines shamed
the wise ones who had him on the snort
end against Battleship at 1 to 5 by land
ing tha course after a run of 2 minutes
and 20 seconds. In the next round against
Lexington, who was comparatively fresh.
Hard IJnes did the trick again with the
odds 10 to 1 against him. It has beea
whispered that Kavanaugh refused a
four-figure offer for hl3 speedy one after
this course. The" other short ends were:
Commander led and beat Thunderbolt at ( to
S; Querlta Vincent beat Risky Attempt at 6 to
1; LrjxlnEton led and beat Beauty Spot at 5
to 3; Tod Sloan beat Diablo at 5 to 3; Frosty

Admiral Sampson led and beat Psyche at t to
3; Miss Skyrocket beat Victor Queen at S to S;
Frosty Morn beat Modesty at S to lj Gold Nug
get beat Daisy Dale at 5 to S; Bunco Bill out
worked and beat Aeneas at 4 to 1; Admiral

AMERICAN DELEGATE HOLLS TELLS
OF PROGRESS TOWARD ARBITRATION
"The priest In politics Is commanded by
God to fight for the right against the
wrong, to struggle for justice against in
justice, to battle for the poor against the
rich; to be the watchman upon the tower,
the sentinel to warn the people of God's
law. And who but the priest shall speu-'t
for that unnumbered multitude who have
no politician to speak for them; who are
pitted in uneven warfare against the
strong and the unmerciful?"
"We. have seen that for ages the
priest is In politics and why. We now ask
is it always expedient for him to be? It
is neither right nor expedient for the
priest to be a partisan. He should not
use his influence to favor candidates or
parties when neither parties nor candi
dates offend, the moral law. The priest
has no right to use his cloth, to say 'we
must stand by our own .people" when he
knows all candidates have a right to fair
ness. . And the priest should be no hunter
of Jobs.
"It is a mean, a despicable thing to ac
cuse a. man of stealing the coppers
from a dead man's eyes. But the mean
est, the most despicable act that a man
can be guilty of Is to accuse a priest, a
minister of God, a man who has given
his labor, his life, his best thought an<l
his best work In the service of his
heavenly master, of Inducing the dying
to bequeath to him their property. And
that has been done in our courts of Jus
tice and the lawyers point to the 'spot on
the alb' aa they sneer at the priest In
politics.
"The priest Is In politics because there
areÂ«not enough" laymen in it. The priest
is in politics because there are wrongs to !
be redressed, because there are solemn
duties to perform. He is in politics to pro
test against offenses which Catholic lay
men, who live by the Catholic church and
on the Catholic church, dare not condemn.
What Catholic layman dare protest
against the injustice of giving to Stanford
University what Is not given to Catholic
schools? What layman dare expose' the
evil of exempting Stanford in Its riches
from taxation and compelling Catholic
schools In their poverty to pay?
"But. it is claimed, the priest is too
high and holy to mix m the dirty busi
ness of politics. Is the priest a peg upon
which to hang a surplice? Is he a mark
for sentimental young ladles to shy em
broidered slippers at? Is he only to givo
that species 1 of spiritual consolation
known as hot air? Is he to be preserved
In a glass case?
"He is a man who must do a man' a
work in a man's way. He must battle for
what he believes to be right; he must
struggle for the downtrodden and the op
pressed, for the weak against the strong,
for the poor against the rich. It is a
mean, a despicable thing to charge a man
with wishing to administer on the
Morgue.
so.. He would be recreant to his God If he
did not. It is claimed that the state shall
make Us 'own laws and the church its
rules. In the United States, where the
state Is founded upon moral law, this'
answer will not hold.
"The Roman empire, was not a gigantic
A. P. A.- written in Latin. It was a tol
erant Government. Christians were not
persecuted because of their religion, but
because they protested against the oath
of allegiance, because they refused to do
what everybody else did, because it was
once more the priest in politics, and the
priest suffered the vengeance of the poli
tician. But principle will triumph over
power and policy, and with Constantino
came the triumph of the Christians. And
with the triumph came new evils. The
priest was not only in politics, he was
the politician, and as Ch'rlst is not Caesar,
so the priest is not the politician. \ A tre
mendous protest arose against the priest
in politics. , Courtier bishops thrived 'and
evils thrived. V ,' '.
"In feudal times the priest. was more
deeply In' politics and louder grew the cry.
The contest was between the church and
the state, each having its own duties
which the other could not perform. Then
came the Protestant reformation, a move
ment political . and not religious, in which
the primary >effort was to cut off from
Catholics that appeal to a power outside
of the. church,: the Pope, ; the greatest
priest fn politics. In Protestantism the
priest is in politics, but' he is a managed
priest, a censored priest, a priest without
power to perform the functions to which
he has been ordained.
"The advocacy of the temporal power of
the Pope is again the priest in politics,
the advocacy of free speech, the demand
of honest priest with no dictating, whis
pering king, emperor or politician. It Is
the demand for a free Pope at liberty to
act and speak within his own dominion.
And such a Pope all Catholics insist upon
having upon the papal throne.
"In all ages; in all lands, you' have the
priest in politics. You have had him *>vcn
here before the United States was a na
tion. You havo had your Father John
Carroll, your Bishop Hughes. And wns
there ever a time In San Francisco when
you didn't havo a priest in politics? They
led blameless lives; they walked well In
the path that God had made for them.
They went out to battle for the right, for
the weak and for the poor and the op
pressed. And yet there have been those
v/ho were priests by accident and poli
ticians by nature.
. "And now has the priest a right to be
in politics? Will we say as a priest, no;
but as a citizen, yes? If a priest wants
to, go to a primary and vote for himself
and some of his friends must he take off
his Roman collar, and leave his priestly
robes In the sacristy? Emphatically, no.
To do so would be uncathollc and cow
ardly. A priest has Influence only as a
priest; he cannot conveniently dividehlm
eelf Into priest and citizen. When a priest
goes out into the world he is a priest. In
politics he is a priest. -Has he a right to
be?
"If the state Is bound by the moral law,
and It Is, then the priest, the exponent of
the moral law, must speak to the state.
He must tell the state as well as the in
dividual Its duty. But must he descend
to particulars? Must he discuss Individual
acts of life? It is his solemn duty to do
i |oÂ»n|IIE REV. FATHER PETER C.
|1 YORKE delivered a lecture last
P nigrht in Metropolitan Hall tb an
J[ audience which crowded the great
edifice to the very doors. In all
his career the eloquent clergyman was
never more brilliant. Time after time the
building thundered with applause. Time
after time he raised his hearers to a tre
mendous pitch of enthusiasm. Again and
again his words received the indorsement
or noisy approval. His theme was time
ly. "The Priest in Politics," and for more
than two hours he made a brilliantly
logical, historical, passidnate plea for the
participation of the priest in political af
fairs.
He insisted that It is a God-Imposed
duTy of the priest to teach the moral
law, to warn against Its transgression, to
expound Its meaning: and to guide the
state to its understanding. At the be
ginning of his lecture he was careful that
the meaning of the word priest, as he
used It, should not be misconstrued.
There Is In society the operation of two
tremendous forcesâ the religious and the
civil. The exponent of one is the priest,
the representative cf the other is the
statesman. Upon this broad plane
Father Yorke discussed his subject, dem
onstrating that for centuries the priest
has been In politics, then telling 1 why he
must and should be and what ought to
bo the motives of expediency and abso
lute right which should govern his par
ticipation in civil affairs. In conclusion
the speaker applied his principles to
local affairs, discussing and criticizing
Incidents with which thousands of San
Franciscans are familiar. Nor did he
neglect to condemn the abuses of the
power which the priest In politics wields.
, The first part of the lecturer's theme
was historical. He traced the priest in
politics from' the time that Moses stood in
disgrace before the civil authorities until
now, when from lurking shadows and
tongues that are cowardly comes the
sneering charge that the priest is spot
ting his garments, degrading his exalted
station, mingling In the mire of politics
and Interfering in affairs not his own.
"In politics as in religion," he said,
"reason has no place. An epithet in both
is worth a cartload of syllogisms, and
when you shout 'the priest In politics'
you throw a shaft more deadly than all
, argument. If It were a catch cry, if the
priest In politics were harmless* a discus
sion would be idle, but the priest in poli
tics Is a serious matter worthy to be dis
cussed, studied and deeply considered.
"The sneering, mortal cry of 'the priest
In politics" was made to Moses. It was
made to Christ and it has a deep his
torical meaning. Christ died not a martyr
to religion, but to Jingoism, misnamed
patriotism. Against him was raised the
dread cry 'the priest in politics' and he
died. His apostles suffered the same fate.
They were men, the civil authorities said,
who disturb our cities, who jeopardize our
government, who set our people in an up
roar. As long as the apostles remained
in a sphere purely religious they weru
safe. When they left it they died. It ;
was again the priest in politics.
KÂ«v. Father Peter C. Yorke delivered a brilliant lecture last night on "The Priest in Politics." The
reverend gentleman made an eloquent defense of the right of all exponents of the moral law to participate in
civil affairs, of the priest to teach the law to the statesman, to warn, guide, admonish and criticize- In all
ages and all lands this relation of church and state has existed. It is from the time of Moses, the priest in
politics.
