Miss Fly, badly bruised.
All of the sixteen houses were totally
destroyed. Mr. Hampton had $400 in
money and this was blown away and only
a part of it has been recovered.
The baby of Jim Chrisman, colored, re
ported lost, was found 3J0 yards from the
house at 10 o'clock l-Â«-ing near a branch
uninjured. One of the family dogs was
lying by its side.
At Lavergne. sixteen miles south of here
on the Nashville. Chattanooga and St.
Louis road, the velocity of the wind was
marvelous and from best reports lasted
only' about twenty seconds. In this short
time about thirty-five dwellings were
turned Into kindling wood. The loss of
life Is small compared with the miracu
lous escapes made. The wind made a
swath about 200 yaras wide through the
middle of the town. The Lavergne HlgU
School and the station, the two largest
buildings, were laid flat. The railroad lost
four section houses also. The victims of
the tornado are:
GEORGE ROBERTSON and his six -
months-old child.
Mr. Robertson's house, which was a
strong log structure, was in the middle
of the path of the storm and was laid flat
on the ground. At the time Robertson
and his child had retired and his wife
was sitting near the bed reading, and be
fore the latter could even warn either her
husband or the child death claimed them.
Mrs. Robertson's escape was marvelous.
When found the unfortunate man was
pinned across the back by a large timber
and a great scar was on. the back of hi s
neck. No mark could be discerned on the
body of the child. .Both are thought to
have met Instant death. Â¦ .
In almost every home there "were sev
eral injured, those most seriously being:
Mrs. Charlton, collarbone broken; six
year-old child of Mach Jordan, cannot re
cover; Elmore House, seriously injured.
In Williamson County great damage
was done, but the town of Franklin
escaped with a comparatively small loss.
Houses and timber in Sumner County also
suffered considerably, but first reports
sent out from Gallatin were exaggerated.
Great suffering is being experienced by
those deprived of homes at Lavergne and
Nolansville.
The rise in the Cumberland River at
Nashville is the most rapid known in
twenty-five years, the water having
climbed twenty feet in gauge since yester
day morning.
Hundreds of Souses Razed and the
LOSSES IN MISSISSIPPI.
Death Roll Increased.
MEMPHIS. Tenn.. Nov. 21.â Advices re
ceived to-night from the storm-swept sec
tions of Mississippi, Arkansas and
Tennessee indicate that the loss of life
and damage to property la far greater
than at first reported. The difficulties In
the way of securing information from the
devastated sections are almost insur
mountable. The places affected are re
mote anil isolated and at the best they
are not well equipped with means of com
munication and the storm which last
evening carried devastation across the
country at the same time swept away the
wires, so that the telephone and telegraph
wires, alike were put out of service. De
pendence has necessarily been placed on
railroad men and travelers coming from
affected parts.
In Mississippi the greatest loss of life
and damage to property occurred near
Tunica, Lula and Hernando. A report
by courier from a point thirteen miles
from Tunica says that the tornado's de
vastation was so great that It will take
weeks to calculate and repair It. Five
negroes lost their lives on the Haralln
place.
In Tunica the church and a number of
buildings were totally demolished. More
than fifty negroes are missing and It is
feared that several of them perished.
Corn Is reported badly damaged.
At Hernando a white man was killed
and a negro fatally injured by flying
debris. Numerous sawmills, several
residences and hundreds of negro cabins
were blown away. At Love Station J. s.
Doney, a white man, was crushed by fly
ing timbers and is expected to die. The
tornado passed down Coldwater River,
leveling trees and houses in its path.
At Batesville much property damage
was wrought and several persons were
seriously Injured, but no fatalities are re
ported. Several dwelling houses, a num
ber of outhouses and many miles or
fencing were down and scattered.
The roof of the Methodist Church was
twisted off and was blown some distance
from the building. News of terrible havoc
southwest of Batesville Is expected, as
generally the houses In that section are
not securely built.
At Â¦ Moscow, ten. miles 'west of La
Grange, several s buildings were swept
away by the wind. No fatalities are re
ported, although many persons Â¦ were in
jured.
In Memphis there is heavy loss as a re
sult of the storm. Culverts were washed
out and small bridges were swept away.
Lumber firms 'on Wolf River suffered se
verely from the destruction of logs and
it Is estimated that. their. losses will foot
up between $300,000 and $500,000.
NASHVILLE, Tenn., Nov. 21.âDis
patches indicate that last night's
storm, which swept over North
ern Mississippi and Central and
Western Tennessee, was one of
I great severity. Advices to the Asso

The path of the storm was about 350
yards wide and was through the north
western suburbs of the town. In Its path
everything is completely wrecked. Not
even the iron and stone fence of the arse
nal grounds is standing. The houses of
Captain Aydelott, the Farrells and 'other
large residences were demolished.
With the exception of these four houses
the storm's path was through a section of
the town populated chiefly by negroes and
the poorer classes, and the houses were
hovels. It Is estimated that 150 of them
were totally destroyed and a larger num
ber damaged. The suffering of these peo
ple, rendered homeless and bereft of all
their goods. Is pitiable.
The number of houses destroyed in the
Nolansvllle neighborhood Is sixteen. There
were two fatalities as follows:

ST. JOHNS, N. F., Nov. 21.â The new
steamer Fife, one of Mr. Reid's fleet of
eight mall boats running In the coast
service, was lost in the Straits of Belle
Island Sunday during a dense snow
storm. The vessel was worth $100,000
and It is believed that she was not in
sured. No lives were lost. The crew of
thirty men took to the boats and had a
terrible experience before reaching land.
SOUTHAMPTON. Nov. 21.â The Red
Star steamer Friesland, Captain Nichels,
which sailed from New York November
7 for this port and Antwerp, passed
Hurst Castle at 9:35 this morning In tow
of two tugs. The Friesland's rudder was
disabled. She was taken by the steamer

CLEVELAND, Nov. 21.â A heavy west
erly gale, which at times reached a
velocity of sixty' miles an hour, swept
over Northern Ohio to-day, prostrating
telephone and telegraph wires in all di
rections. In this city the wind played
havoc with chimneys, trees and plate
plat-s windows. The temperature Is fall-
Ing rapidly.
Â¦ The wind and rain created havoc all
over the city, according to the reports re
ceived yesterday by Commissioner Man

force of the water caused twenty-three

A Night of Dismay and Danger in

"The Daisy Rowe went ashore at 7 p.

enough of her left to make It worth

we made our way to the lighthouse sta
tion and there the keeper -Sid everything

"That roller threw the schooner so hard
against the rocks that her seams all
opened up and she began to fill. I went
down into the cabin to secure my ciothes
and some $30 In money, but found the
cabin flooded. The forecastie was also
flooded and I saw there was no hope for
the vessel. I told the men to save them
selves. H. Anderson, one of the crew,
volunteered to swim ashore with a Hfo
line. He succeeded, but had a terrible
time of it. The remainder of the crew
got ashore on the line, but when I was
leaving the vessel broke up and I was
caught In the wreckage.
"While I was wondering what was the
matter I noticed that the tlJe was setting
us down Into that little cove jusi this

In through the Golden Gate and the wind
began to rage. One of the crew got over
the side with the intention of swimming
ashore. A roller came in and threw him
bruised and bleeding on the beach. An
other member of the crew attempted to
take a line ashore and he also was nearly
killed. The captain and four remaining
members of the crew went to secure their
effects, but they found both the fore

little wind and the last of the ebb tide
was running. A sudden eddy caught the
boat and set her In for Point Bonita.
When near Diablo all control of the
schooner was lost and she rapidly drifted
in toward the rocks. An attempt was
made to hold her with an anchor, but
there was no holding ground on the rocky
bottom.
Six men had a battle with the elements
on Tuesday night that they will not soon
forget. All of them escaped, thanks to a
friendly wave, but two of them were so
exhausted when they reached the beach
that they would have died had It not been
for the kindly assistance of the lighthouse

havoc reigned all over the city. At the
Presidio the soldiers suffered from the
onslaught of the elements, and it is esti
mated that $2500 damage was done to tents

The robbers finally announced that they
had no more dynamite, and then they
gave up the task of forcing open the door.
Then, picking up the local express box
and several packages, they ran to their
horses which had been hitched near by
and rode rapidly away. No attempt was
made to disturb or molest the passen

Inquisitive passenger who peered out of

ST. LOUIS, Nov. 21. â News was received
here to-night of the holding up of the
Iron Mountain cannon ball train, bound
north, at GlfYord. Ark., a few miles this
Bide of Malvern Junction. The holdup
occurred at 7:30 o'clock and was partici
pated in by half a dozen men.
The bandits had built a huge bonfire on
the track, undoubtedly figuring that It
would cause the engineer to bring the
train to a standstill. He. however, fearing
tin attempted robbery, opened the throt
tle and sought to push through the ob-
Ftructlon. Several ties, of which the fire
was made, caught in the pilot and soon
brought the train to a stop. Instantly
three masked men ordered the engineer
r.nd fireman to leave the engine at once.
Another robber went to the side of the
car, hailed the conductor and ordered
Mm to remain inside. Each' order was
obeyed. While the four robbers were
standing guard and occasionally firing a
phot to frighten the passenpv-rs. th*>ir two
accomplices entered the express car and
ordered Messenger Samuel R. Avery to
"step aside or get to the other corner."
The large safe was charged five times
â¢with dynamite, each explosion making a
terrific noise and tearing off portions of
the car. A large hole was bored into the
door of the safe, but an entrance could

There was a wild time on the front Tues
day r.Ight. Ships dragged their anchors,
tugs were rushing to and fro averting
disasters, telephone and telegraph poles
were thrown to the ground, yachts were
driven ashore and in several instances
houses partially built were leveled to the
ground. "
The bark Edward May was tied up at
Oakland wharf. The gale caused her to
part her mooring line and she was
thrown across the dock against the new
Mall Company's sheds. The bark was
considerably damaged and a portion or
the new sheds Is. wrecked.
The. British ship Cawdor had a narrow
escape from going on Goat Island. She
was anchored off Pacific street and went
adrift early In the gale. The tug Alert
caught her Just asshe was going ashore.
In another minute she would have been,
on the beach and nothing could hav*
saved her. She had forty-five fathoms of
chain out and the tug had to hold her
up against the gale until all that was hove
In. Then the Cawdor was towed tatÂ»
safety.
The French bark Lamordere drifted
from near the Presidio to off the bell on
Alcatraz, where her anchors held. Tha
brig Harriet G came in from Grays Har
bor with a load of lumber and when she
attempted to anchor off Black Point the
wind took possession and she landed
alongside the Lamorciere. Neither ves
sel was damaged. In fact, considering tha
number of narrow escapes on the front,
the amount of damage Is trifling.
The ship Pericles drifted from off Black
Point to near Alcatraz, where her anchors
held.
An unknown pile driver was In collision
with the ship America, carrying away her
topsail yards.
The bark Charles Gounod was ran Into

damaged, but the scow was dismasted.
The yawl Royal broke away from her

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL.LIFE LOST AND
GREAT DAMAGE
DONE IN MAR1N
Camper Drowned on a Marsh
and Havoc Created .
Along the Bay.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Nov. 21.â One of the
most terrific storms in years swept this
county last night. One life was lost and
thousands of dollars damage to property
has been sustained. Some time during 1
the night an unknown man who had been
camping for a week on marsh below
the broad gauge depot was pinned down
under the wreckage of his overturned
wagon and drowned in the shallow water
that covered the marsh. Kvldently ho
had been sleeping in the wagon when tho
heavy wind overturned the vehicle. From
appearances he had made a hard struggle
to extricate himself. His body was dis
covered this morning and removed to the
morgue, where it awaits identification. In
a book found in the wagon the name
"Black" appears, as does the record of
several purchases made at Santa Cruz on
October 15. The unknown was a chain
mender and tool-sharpener, about 5 feet
3 Inches in height, of light complexion and
about 3S years old.
The storm did great damage throughout
the country. Fences, barns and outbuild
ings on many of the ranches were de
stroyed and at Sausalito and.Tlburon old
timers pronounce it the heaviest Btorm
that has swept the bay shore In twenty
five years. All telegraph and telephone
lines from this city up the coast are down
and the Bollnas road was covered by
fallen trees, which delayed the stagÂ© sev
eral hours. At Sausalito many small
boats were lost and wharves and floats
were in some Instances ruined. The sloop
Cygnus, owned by Dr. Edward Hill, was
driven across the bay on to the rocks of
the west side of Belvedere. The large
yawl Royal was sunk on the west side of
the narrow gauge railroad wharf. Only
her masts are visible above the water.
Captain Johnson's boat landing was
ruined and he lost several small boats.
Charles Forrest lost several small boats
and a large float.
The unfinished house of Peter Wellnltz
at Old Sausalito was blown down, as was
the nearly completed house of Alfred
Willford. The latter fell with â¢ a crash
that startled the whole town. The dam
age here will amount to several thousand
dollars. ,
Last night several fishermen were res
cued more dead than alive -by the soldiers
at Punta Cavallo. Their boat was
wrecked. , :>Â¦/-;
At Tlburon and Angel Island the storm
broke with terrible force. The new school
house in course of construction at Tiburon
was blown down and the loss will be $1000
The schooner scow Caroline, laden with
sand, was caught In the storm and driven
Into the cove at Belvedere. Being unable
to save her, an attempt. was made to run
her ashore, but she sank In the water be
tween the drawbridge and Belvedere. The
ark La Boheme; owned by Mark Howell
of San Francisco, broke from her moor
ings and knocked down several cottages
on the beach at Belvedere. She then cut
off a portion of a wharf owned by Eugene
Davis and damaged a cottage owned bv
the Belvedere Land Company and occu
pied by Edward Clough. The ark was
picked up near the drawbridge this morn
ing, badly damaged.
At Angel Island the storm played havoc
with the small buildings. On the Govern
ment wharf a fifty-horsepower boiler was
picked up by the wind and- blown fifty
yards into the bay.- The lookout house on
the southwestern point of the Island also
was carried Into the bay. Many small
outhouses followed its example and dis
appeared entirely. . -. â ,
Last night a French . steel bark was
driven by the wind and heavy. seas' to

The local rain gauge shows an unusual
rainfall as well. During the twenty-four
hours ending at noon to-day 2.12 Inches
of rain fell, according to the Sanborn
gauge, making a total of 6.37 Inches of
rain for the present season as against
10.19 inches for the same period last sea
son. . Â» â¢
The wind did very general damage In
Oakland last night, unlike the storm of
Friday night of last week, which seemed
to strike only in one place. Trees and
fences suffered In nearly every part of
Oakland, and the tall adrcrtlsing fences
There have been only two other occa
sions when the wind reached a velocity
that was of sufficient importance to make
recording worth while. One was on Jan
uary 4, 1895.- when it blew forty miles an
hour, and again on January 10, 1SS9, when
it blew forty-one miles an hour. Last
night between the hours of 12:30 and 1:30
in the morning the wind reached the
greatest velocity.
The worst storm that ever swept over
Oakland struck the town last night, to
the great damage" of electric light, tele
graph and telephone wires, trees, fences
and a few buildings. That it was actually
the worst storm Is shown by the official
records ot % the Chabot Observatory, which
registered the velocity of the wind as
forty-nine miles an hour.

WORST STORM IN ITS HISTORY.
Chief McAdle of the local branch of the
Vnited States Weather Bureau is glad
that San Francisco and vicinity are out
cf the throes of the storm. He predicts
that we are now in for a spell of clear
weather, but suggests that residents of
this city carry their ymbrellss, as there
is every likelihood of overuue showers
falling at unexpected moments. Accord-
Ing to his statement given out last even
ing, San Francisco has not experienced in
many years such a heavy storm as that
which passed over It between the hours
of 9 o'clock Tuesday night and 4 o'clock
yesterday morning. At the height of the
storm, which was 1 o'clock yesterday
morning, the wind blew at the rate of
lorty-four miles an hour over the Mills
building. The cups of the wind gauge
which is set on top of the Mills building
spun around 225.000 times in twenty-four
hours. Thii? alone is a marvelous record,
but was surpassed on the night of Febru
ary 22, 1S91. when the wlno reached a
maximum rate of forty-eight miles an
hour and blew the cups off, and on De
cember 23. 1892, when the. wind velocity
over the Mills building was sixty miles an
hour, which Is the record for this city.
Chief McAdie gazed with delight at thÂ«
"beautiful" record automatically printed
by the patent wind gauge. He says it is
the most accurate and one of the prettiest
ever made on this coast, and he pays a
high tribute to his office force for keep
ing the instruments in such splendid
ehape.
He also said that studying the course
of the storm was as interesting 1 to the
Weather Bureau officials as is an annual
football game to the average college en
thusiast. He states that the storm camÂ©
from the north and its course was traced
with' ease. It is now spending its fury
over the Sierras and traveling at a great
rate of speed. While Chief McAdie Is
happy to say that the storm Is out of his
district, "he regrets that his colleagues fur
ther east are In for some bitterly cold
and disagreeable weather.

forth expecting death or worse. Knives i
and swords were held over their heads ,
and all their possessions were taken from |
them except their clothing. They were j.
then made to march to Huailu. their for
mer home. Here they were met by tn 1 
mandarin upon whose advice they nau
gone Into hiding. This man beat and
abused Mr. Green and reproached him tor
not coming to him for advice and protec
tion. The mandarin then said he wouid
send the' party to Chengting-Fu. with au
escort of imperial troops. He assurc.l
them they would receive ample protection
at Chengting-Fu. Th* party was place-1
in tho rough, wooden-wheeled carts of the
country and started on their journey.
About three miles out they were over
taken by the Boxers who had originally
captured them and on reaching Cheng
ting-Fu were refused admission to the city
because of their escort. For three days
and nights, without stop, except at rare
intervals to partake if native food, tno
almost helpless man to whom the slight
est assistance was refused, two women
and two tender children were carted
through the country to Paoting-Fu.
Loaded with abuse, mistreated and suffer
ing, the place literally swarming with
Boxers demanding their lives, the hapless
prisoners were escorted to the yamen of
the chief magistrate. Ting Yuen, who re
fused to receive them. Then occurred a
strange incident. *
Boxer -Pleads for Prisoner.
The chief Boxer himself pleaded for his
prisoners and induced Ting Yuen to come
and speak to Mr. Green. He expressed
sorrow at seeing the condition of Hie
prisoners, and said he would send them
to Tientsin under an escort of imperial
troops and with official passports. He also
offered to provide them wit., sufficient
money to secure food on the journey.
That morning they were taken to a boat,
but found neither troops nor passports.
They were, in fact, again in the hands of
the Boxers, who took them some thirty
miles down the .river, and on Wednesday
afternoon landed them in a marsh-cov
ered with high reeds and informed them
that Ting Yuen had ordered that they
should be put to death and their bodies
disposed of. At this time the children
were undoubtedly the means of saving
the lives of the entire party, for the same
Boxer who had previously Interceded for
them and had evidently conceived a great
fondness for the little ones, cried and told
Mr. Green they must try and reach Tlen
tslrt alone. He then left them and took
the boat away. The money which had
been provided for their -subsistence was
in the copper cash of the country and was
too bulky to carry: therefore the little
band was left entirely helpless In a vast
swamp. To add to their misery violent
storms arose, and toward evening as they
shivered in thÂ«:ir hiding place they heard
bands of Boxers scouring the swamp in
search of them, their presence having
been discovered by some villagers. As
night fell. Mr. Green, almost helpless
from his wounds, made his way, accom
panied by his party, to a house, and was
told by the owner that a friend of his
would take them to Tientsin. Then he
left ostensibly to get a boat and make
arrangements for their escape. After a
while the villager returned, bringing, not
the promised aid, but a large party of
Boxers. The mob burst in the door of the
hut and unmercifully beat with swords
and staves Mr. Green, the women and
children.
Another Cruelty in Sto^re.
Almost insensible, despairing and hope
less, the devoted little party gave up, but
other cruelty was In store for them. The
Boxers decided to take their captives to
a village a mile away - and devised the
means of transporting and torturing them
at the same time. Mr. Green's left hand
was bound to. his left foot: Mrs. Green
and Miss Grieg were tied hands to feet,
left hand to left foot and right hand to
right foot, and the little girl was treated
In the same way. Spear handles were
then thrust under their arm pits and they
were carried to their destination. The lit
tle boy was slung across the back of a
man. In the village of Slnan they were I
thrown down. l>ound. in the filthy mud of I
a courtyard and examined as to their!
identity. Their story was laughed at. the j
examiners ref.J.?lng to believe that any .
foreign devils had been let go by the Box- i
ers, and a deputation was sent to Paoting- j
Vu to ascertain the truth and determine j
the fate of the captives. In the meantime j
the party, bound and trussed like fowls, ;
were thrown into a templf. There they Â¦
remained for two days, their hands being
unbound in order to permit them to eat
the meager rations of unground, uncookeu
millet, and t-nld water served to them.
On the third day the deputation returned
from Paoting-Fu and the captives were
told that Ting Yuen had previously or
dered their death and had now repeated
the sentence. Providentially there wern
two sections of Boxers, the civil and thÂ«
military, the former supplying arras and
subsistence to the movement and devising
operations which the latter executed. ThÂ«.
civil section had heard of the defeat of
the Boxers at Taku and elsewhere and
ordere 1 the prisoners to be kept alive, to
be used as hostages should the allies be
sent to destroy the city of Paotlng-Fu.but
should no such movement be made they
would consent to the death of the foreign
ers. To this policy the little party owe
their lives. After two days of misery
they were unbound and allowed dally
walks in the compound with swords ai
their necks, and sleeping in the temple
under a close guard. For three. weeks they
remained In this deplorable captivity,
daily expecting -death, demanded every
day. by the Increasing horde of Boxers,
who Insisted that the women should be
turned over to them alive, to be after
ward put to death. One gleam of hope
they had.
Saved by a Chinese.
A native looking at them through the
window of their prison threw In a piece ot
paper and motioned to Mr. Green to read,
it. Thinking It was only another Insult,
he refused to do so. but on the persistent
gestures of the Chinaman and the insist
ence of the women he did so, and found
written on the paper the following mes
sage: "Do not fear. The Boxers are be
ing killed. I am going to Tientsin and will
inform your Consul."
The Chinaman was true to his word.
Carrying his life in his hands, he made
his way to Tientsin and reported the mat
ter to General Lome-Campbell, the Brit
ish commander. General Lorne-Campbell
immediately wrote to the Fantl of Pao
ting-Fu, threatening reprisal should any
harm befall the Greens or Miss Grieg.
Upon receipt of this message Ting Yuen
sent an official to Sinan to fetch the cap
tives to Paoting-Fu for safe keeping. This
official was informed at Sinan that the
party had been sent away. In reality
they were then secluded in a small room
In the temple because oi the Increasing
demand of the constantly swelling Boxer
mob that the women be handed over to
them. The messenger from the Fantl was
finally told that if he went to Angchou
the prisoners would be delivered to him.
Final Rescue by the French.
On September 5 the prisoners were taken
to Angchou and delivered to Ting Yuen's
representatives, put on a boat and ar
rived at Paoting-Fu September 6. Here
they were put in the common prison and
confined for four days. On receipt of an
other letter from the British commanding
officer at Tientsin, they were removed to
a small house and accorded better treat
ment. In this house 'they remained until
the arrival of the French column on Oct
ober 13. Hearing of the presence of the
French Mr. Green asked why they were
not handed over and was told that the
French had come on business connected
with the railway and had nothing to do
with their case. On the night of the 15th
a servant managed to Inform the French
commandant of the presence of the. party
and early the following morning theli
bondage was broken and they were
handed over to European protection. .

sion,' with their two children, a. boy and
a girl aged five and three years, and Miss
Grieg, an assistant, were stationed at
Huai-Lu, a small town 120 miles south
of this place. During the first week of
July news of thejnassacre was received in
Paoting-Ku and also news of the destruc
tion of the mission at Shunti-Fu, Chao
chon and Shonyang, and of the moving
of the troops from the Shangsl Province
toward Tientsin to attack the foreigners.
On hearing of the state of affairs the lit
tle party moved away to the mountains,
on the advice of the mandarin, to go into
hiding. They took with them only a few
bare necessities, carrying the children
asleep in their arms, and were conducted
by two or three Chinese servants to a Chi
nese temple a short distance back in tha
hills. Here they remained two days, and
were then informed Dy the villagers who
used the temple that they must at once
leave.' , They, were also told that their
home had been destroyed and the site
made the headquarters of a Boxer camp.
Some friendly Chinese showed the party
a small cave a little distance from the
temple, where they remained secreted for
two days and three nights, suffering the
utmost discomforts, their hiding place be
ing only about six feet by four, with
water dripping unceasingly from the roof.
While the party lay in the cave the Box
ers were seen and heard searching the
mountains for the "foreign devils." On
the third day their servants discovered
them and led them to a farm hut, where
; the entire party lived in one small room
for a month., not daring to stir from their
retreat In the'daytlme and only with the
greatest caution at night. On August 13
the Boxers discovered their hiding place,
from which their host had made a tunnel
to a cave a short distance away. The
Boxers demanded that the little band be
given up to them.

The catarrhal poisort Is in the blood and

discharge sometimes closing up the nos-
trils, dropping into the throat, causing
deafness by closing the Eustachian tubes,

The best and most modern remedies for
this purpose are antiseptics scientifically
known as EucaJyptol. Guaiacol, San-
guinaria and Hydrastin. and while each
of these have been successfully used sep-

them all combined in one palatable, con-

der brush has reached such a height that
scarcely any points of this portion of the
valley can be seen. This driveway will
open up new sights and also act as a
safeguard against fires.
Guardian Stevens has a very Interesting
history. In 18C5 he crossed the plains
under General Curtis on an Indian expedi
tion and met many thrilling adventures.
On one occasion while scouting he was
captured by the Indian chief, Raln-in
the-Face, and bound to a' tree with ropes.
Hideous war cries sounded in his ears
throughout the night, preparatory to his
being burned at the stake at sunrise. Gen
eral Curtis sent a detail, which reached
him just in time.
Mr. Stevens came to California In 1872
and became a famous stage driver into
the Yosemito and as such has been in
some of the most exciting stage robberies
on record. After the last hold-up In 1897
he followed the highwayman. Tatum. and
captured him in the vicinity of Marl
posa. During his career as a driver he
has carried many noted people into the
valley, one of them being Mrs. Langtry.
On this trip he distinguished himself by
making the best time ever known in
mountain staging, traveling from Madera
to Yosemlte, a distance of ninety-two
miles, in ten hours and twenty minutes.
YOSEMITE, Nov. 21. â Campers
visiting the Yosemlte Valley next
season will enjoy more privileges
than formerly. The new board
of commissioners has decided
that the camping reservation will ex
tend over more territory. Heretofore
campers were restricted to three particu
lar placesâ under the Royal' Arches, near
the Yosemite Falls and a small stretch of
ground on the banks of the Merced River.
The great obstacle to campers has al
ways been the lack of places to purchase
fresh meats, bread and horse feed. This
year a bakery, butcher shop, clubhouse
and store have been erected, which will
buppIv the many wants of the campers
and tourists. John T. Stevens, the
guardian of the valley, has ha,d the price
ol hay and barley reduced.
A foot trail has been built from the
Sentinel Hotel to the Happy Isles, a dis
tance of two miles and a half, â¢winding
around the Merced River and covered by
a canopy of maple and oak trees, afford
ing the sightseer a delightful stroll and
new views of the valley. A broad avenue
also has been completed, extending from
the North Dome to the base of Glacier
Point. At this end of the valley the un-
thrir youngest fiaushter. Miss Helen
"\Yo! r.stock. was united In marriage to

the Union district, are in the County Jail
charged Â¦with having stolen a wagon load
of furniture. A charge of burglary will
be placed against them.
The furniture, which is valued at $150,
belonged to the estate of W. A. I^arkin.
A few years ago the Larkln residence at
Union burned and the furniture that was
saved was removed to a granary on the
place, which was fitted up as a tempor
ary residence. Larkln died nearly a year
ago and the place was being looked after
by a neighbor. On Monday it was discov
ered the granary had been broken open
and the furniture carted away.
Sheriff Langford at once went to work
on the case. Suspicion pointed to Howard
and Brown and they were arrested. How
ard made a full confession. The furniture
had been sold to the Garden City Fur
niture Company for $15. Howard went to
the furniture company's store and said
he wanted to sell some furniture, as he
was moving away. They told him to
bring it in. He borrowed a truck from
one of the neighbors and at 2 o'clock Sat
urday morning he and Brown went to the
Larkin place, broke into the granary and
loaded the furniture into the wagon. At 8
o'clock that morning they drove into town
and sold it. Â» -
Howard, who is 24 years old, is a grad
uate of the Whlttier Reform School. He
bears a bad reputation at Union and for
some time has terrorized the community.
Brown is only 19 years of age, and was
dragged into the scrape by Howard.

"You are entitled to your exception,"

your pardon for using it. but the abject

to use the remark out of pity for the de

A further competitive movement In ro
oent ship charters by San Francisco ship
ping men has made it practically impos
sible for British Columbia lumbermen to

cently made here for ships at rates even
higher than the current charges, but thu
Puget Sound people engaged _the vessels

Â¦VANCOUVER.. Nov. 2Lâ A Canadian
owned lumber fleet is to be built by Gov
ernment aid, if the plans of representa
tives of the provincial and federal author
ities be carried out. It is claimed that
nothing less than a Government subsidy
for the building and operation of lumber
ships will save this leading industry of
British Columbia from collapse. It is pro
posed to accomplish this by granting a
bonus to Canadian ships on the Pacific
Coast, based on the tonnage carried.. The
lumbermen claim that San Francisco ship
owners, noting the scarcity of deep-wator
vessels, have advanced the rates 60 cents
por thousand on lumber. . Kor the last
twelve months lumber freight rates have
been 60 cents per thousand lower In San
Francisco and Seattle ihan in British Co
lumbia. There is also said to be a fur
ther difference In freight rates in favor
of San Francisco and Puset Sound for
foreign ships. It Is feared that these In
fluences will result in the effectual side
tracking of the British Columbia lumber
business, unless it is fostered.

In taking Swamp-Root you afford
natural help to Nature, for Swamp-
Root Is the most perfect healer
gentle aid to the kidneys that is known
to medical science.
When you are sick or "feel badly,"
the first thing you should do is to afford
aid to your kidneys by using Dr. Kil-
mer's Swamp-Root, the great kidney
remedy.
When your kidneys are not doing
their work, some of the symptoms
which prove it to you are pain or dull
ache In the back, excess of uric add.
gravel, rheumatic pains, sediment In
the urine, scanty supply, scalding irri-
tation in passing it. obliged to go often
during the day and to get up many
times during the night to empty the
bladder; sleeplessness? nervous irrita-
bility., dizziness, irregular heart,
breathlessness, sallow, unhealthy com-
plexion, puffy or dark circles under the
eyes; sometimes the feet, limbs or body
bloat; loss of ambition, general weak-
ness and debility.
i The kidneys are the sewers of tho human
sytem.
Do you know what happens to the
human system when the kidneys be-
come clogged? They are unable to
throw out the impurities from the blood
and become infected with poisons; they
decay, fall apart and pass out in the
urine; the blood, unfiltered, carries the
poison all through the system, and If
not checked death follows.

hours. If upon examination you find
any settlings or sediment, if it Is milky
or cloudy, or if particles float about in
it, disease has gotten a foothold in
your kidneys and Nature is calling for
help.
If you have tho slightest symptom
of kidney or bladder trouble, or If there
is a trace of it in your family history,
you would profit by taking; Swamp -
Root every now and then as a prevent-
ive, and thus absolutely forestall kid-
ney and bladder troubles.
The famous new discovery. Swamp-
Root, has been tested in so many ways.
In hospital work, in private practice,
among tho helpless too poor to pur-
chase relief, and has proved so success-
ful in every case, that a special ar-

monial letters from men and women

usefulness by means of Swamp-Hoot,
the ereat kidney remedy.

His Way.

DBTJGSTORE PROPBIETOR
BOBBED BY MASKED MEN
Hold Him TJp in His Place* of Busi-
ness and Take Money and
Jewelry.
OAKLAND, Nov. 21.â Clinton A, Smith,
the proprietor . of the drugstore on the
corner of Eighth and Peralta streets in
West Oakland, was held up to-night by
two masked men, who took $30 in cash
and a watch. . .
Mr. Smith was Just closing his store
at 10:30 when two 'men walked up to the
counter. They were medium sized, and
each man had a .handkerchief tied over
his face and carried a revolver. One man
held a revolver at Smith's head while the
other took all the money In the place.
They then searched Smith and took all
the money he had In his pockets and his
watch. AVhile one of the men covered
Smith with his revolver the other pulled
the telephone wires out, preventing Smith
from notifying the police at once. They
then told him that they would shoot him
if he left his store inside of half an hour
and disappeared in the darkness.
Smith managed to get to a telephone
shortly afterward and notified the police.
:A squad of men was sent to search for
the robbers, but they had half an hour's
start and either hid in the railroad yards
or escaped to San Francisco on the train.
About three months ago a clerk In this
same store reported that he had been
robbed, but investigation showed that he
had used the money himself.

AMONG the events down for de
cision at Tanf oran Park yester
day was the Doncaster stakes,
for three-year-olds, over seven
furlongs. Of the original list of
nominations. Modrine from the stable of
Green Morris and Sam Hlldreth"s Vul
caln, each Carrying 123 pounds, were the
only ones to respond to the bugle call.
As the heavy going seemed to be all in
favor of Modrine. the big colt was held
a prohibitive 1 to 6 choice In the books,
while pasteboards on the Hildreth horse
could scarcely be peddled out at any
price. Everything went well for the fa
vorite after the start until the turn for
home was neared. Here Coburn on Vul
caJn closed on the leader and soon had
Wedderstrand riding hard. Great beads
of perspiration stood out on the browB of
these who had backed Modrine and a
sigh of relief was heard as he eventually
passed the.Judges winner by a scant neck.
It came within an ace of being an ola
fashloned upset. â¢â¢ M '.
Whereas It was generally supposed the
track would be sloppy, the wind had ac
complished wonders, for instead the
course was dry and heavy, especially so
next to the rail. Three choices met with
defeat
Black Oslter Joe fUrnished the surprise
of the afternoon by capturing the third
number at odds of 30 to 1. Tossed In with
r mediocre band of platers, the distance
wns considered too short for Randall s
hcrse. In fact, It was, but Genua. Cyril
and Duckoy backed up so badly that Joe
had it his own way at the close, beating
Cyril and Montallade out a length. The
winner was exceedingly well ridden by
McDonald.
After a somewhat extended vacation,
Eddie Jones, the Morello horse, made his
reappearance in the opening run with
Johnny Woods in the saddle. Backed
sparingly at 6 and 8 to 1. he locked horns
in the stretch with Sea Lion, and in a
very close fit at the wire, was first by a
nod. Imperious seems to have lost all
form.

says In his complaint he married his wife
July 31, 1S89. For some time they lived
happily, he continues, but durinsr the past
year she has added much to his store of
misery. She has constantly scolded, and
nagged him. he says, and although she
continually complained that he returned
from his office on various occasions too
late for dinner at the St. Nicholas Hotel,
where they were living, shÂ© refused to go
to housekeeping.

Secretary of War Sees
Points of Interest in

Returning to this city they were enter

Menedez & Co. on board the steamer
Relna de Los Angeles, which was made a
prize during the war, Mr. Root, re
sponding to a toast to his health, said
ln part:
"I am visiting Cuba as the representa

pose of making an Investigation of its In
habitants, particularly with reference to
their ability to govern themselves. From
newspaper reports I had come to Imagine
that the Cubans were only partially civll-
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Nov. 21.-Secre
tary Root and General Wood, with the
members of their party, took a train to
Daiquiri yesterday and returned to this
city on horseback, following the route of
the army in the summer of 1898. General
Wood acted as guide and showed the
points of special Interest on the various
battlefields, explaining the strategy used
by the American commanders. Mr. Root
was intensely interested in the Gausamaa
battlefield, the scene of the first hard
fight of the Rough Riders, where Captain
Allyn K. Capron and Sergeant Hamilton
Fish Jr. were among the killed.
Dr. Max Magnus, supervisor of physical
culture ln the School Department, will be
obliged to resort to the courts ln
order to draw his salary of $200 per month
in the future. Superintendent Webster
notified the Board of Education at its
meeting yesterday that he would not audit
Magnus' demand for salary. This decision
was precipitated by Casserly, who asked
the Superintendent:
"Why is It that you sign Dr. Magnus"
demand, yet you refuse to sign Mrs. De
Yoe's demand as a special teacher of
cooking?"
"I hold that Dr. Magnus does not re-

quire a certificate, since he Is not a teach
er but a director of physical culture," re
plied Webster.
Directors Denman and Kincald both de
clared emphatically that Dr. Magnus did
teach the study.
"Well, this is news to me," said Web
ster. "I have been misinformed and as
suredly if Dr. Magnus is going from class
to class to teach he must have a legal
certificate and I snail not sign his demand
until he is given one on the recommenda
tion of the Board of Examination."
The resolution presented by Superinten

ment of attendance officers whose duty-
It will be to Induce parents to place their
children ln school and to perform such
other functions as the board may direct
to secure children their educational
rights was defeated. The board gave aÂ»
a reason for Us refusal to attempt the en
forcement of the compulsory education
law the shortage of funds. Mark stated
that the two truant officers now employed
ln the department would be authorized to
act as attendance officers until the fin
ances permitted the installation of Web
ster's plan.
The graduates from ihe English depart
ment of the Lowell Hieh School of the
class of 'So were granted permission to
award a medal to a student who shall
graduate from the Latin scientific de
partment ln the school mentioned with
the best record in scholarship.
Miss M. H. Slavan was transferred from
the Everett Grammar School to the Chi
nese School.
Subdivisions E, F and G of the resolu
tions relating to the promotion of ad
vanced eighth grades were rescinded.
The leave of absence of Miss J. Smith
â¢was continued to November 26, 1900.
The request of the California Stato
Teachers' Association to hold Its annual
session ln the Mission High School build
ing was granted.
Leave of absence was prranted to M. S.
Blanchard from November 26 to December
24. 1900.
The board decided to Issue a certificate
ln drawing to Miss JC. Ball on the recom
mendation of the Board of Examination,
she having passed a successful examina
tion In the study.
G. W. Dennis addressed the board and
requested that the Kochstadter bequest
be given to the Colored Old People's
Home The terms of the beauest were
that the' money should be used for the
purchase of medals to be awarded In com
petition to colored pupils. Ab this plan
fs not feasible. Director Casserly was di
rected to Investigate whether the bequest
may be used for purposes other than it
provides.
was soueht to be so regulated as to secure to
the miner an opportunity to make technical
"discovery" of mineral substances as a pre
cedent to location, in accordance with law. A
measure of this nature is demanded by the
peculiar conditions of the petroleum Industry:
would be but a measure of simple justice ne
cessary to give efiVct to the spirit and intent
of the mining law ; would be but a wise adap
tation to the oil Industry of the tunnel site
law und would work no Injury or inconveni
ence to any legitimate Interest; and that we
henrtily recommend the passage of the pro
posed "act cf Congress recommended by the
executive committee of the California Miners'
Association and by the Petroleum Miners" Co
o;*rative Association, being Senate bill No.
332C. now pending before Congress, and earn
estly urge our Senators and Representatives In
Congress to use all honorable means to secure
the pasease thereof.
Resolved. That In the opinion of this body
the geological conditions attending oil mining
and the multiplication of wells which penetrate
water-yielding strata and release their stores
of water, make wise and timely Investigation
of the alleged Injuries done to oil wells and
oil fields by the flooding of porous oil-yielding
strata from such Induced flows of water. We
note the fact that the laws of certain Kastern
States recognize the Injury to the oil Interests
caused ln this way and require the casing of
water-yielding wells ln oil regions and the
effective plugging of abandoned wells.
Resolved. That we heartily favor State legis
lation relative to the needs of the petroleum
Industry, and it is suKKested that one import
ant matter Is that of the regulation of mining
rights on lands controlled by the State, in
cluding tide lands, the bed of the ocean to the
three-mile limit and the beds of streams, all
mining operations In euch ground being now
conducted by the simple suffrance of the State
and the only mining rights obtainable being
those based on possession.
Resolved. That, ln the Judgment of this asso
ciation, the mining industry of this country,
with Its output of raw material exceeding a
billion dollars In annual value. Its tremendous
BiRnlncance to the industrial prosperity of the.
nation and its etlll more splendid promise for
the future, warrants and demands the govern
mental protection and assistance that can tv*
adequately extended only through a Cabinet
department of the executive branch of the Gov
ernment. We therefore heartily Indorse the
now national demand for a Cabinet Depart
ment of Mines and Mining.
The chairman of the committee was di
rected by the convention to add a clause
to this resolution, inviting other organiza
tions to Join with the California Miners'
EX-STATE SENATOR E. C, VOORHEIS, THE NEW PRESIDENT OF THE
CALIFORNIA MINERS' ASSOCIATION. WHO WAS UNANIMOUSLY
ELECTED AT THE CONVENTION JUST CLOSED.
TIIE ftorm that threatened the
Miners' Convention blew over yes
terday afternoon', and ln the lull
that followed Julian Sonntag was
recognized so that he might nom
inate E. C. Voorheis for president of the
yssociatlon.
ln m:iking thÂ« nominating; speech Sonn
tag said It bad been reported that there
would be a contest in the election for the
presidency, but h* knew of no contest and
he was sure there would be none. Jacob
Noflf seconded the nomination and Voor
heis was elected by acclamation. It was
announced uuring the morning's Fusion
that Sonntas had withdrawn, and fo all
was pood foeling when the time for the
nominations arrived.
Tirey L. Ford nominated Fred Zeitler
of N>va<la for first vice president and
Davis nominated.' Lew E. Aubury of Los
Anfre-les. for secqnd vice pres.dent. Kd
v.ard H. Benjamin of Alarncda, the In
cumbf-nt. was nominated for secretary,
and S. J. Hendy. incumbent, for treas
urer. There was no <-ontest for any of
the offices.
Next to the election the most Important
proceeding of the day was the reception
of the report of the committee on reso
lutions. It embodies practically all the
work of the convention, as' suggested by
the various reports. Stripped of their
preambles, the resolutions adopted were
as follows:
Resolved. Tliat we welcome into the fullest
fellowship our fellow miners who are doint;
so much to develop the petroleum mining in
dustry of the State and pledge to them our
heartiest eo-o;-eration and support ln every
n;easure in which we may be of service to
them.
Kesolved. That we highly appreciate th<?
effort? made by the national Congress and thÂ»
Legislature of this .^tate to secure the passage
by each of those bodies of that measure known
as the California mineral lands bil 1 ; that we
Â«-arnest!v urge upon the Congress of the Unlte-l
S:aieÂ« that such efforts may be continued at
its coming session, to the end that the Oili-
Icrnia lands bill may become the law of tl.e
land and be the means of preventing the fur
ther absorption by corporate lnten-sts jl an
area oi land of great value to t^e pnjspector
Resolved. That the executive committee of
the California Miners' Association ehall de
termine the constitutionality of the Camlnetti
law ln the courts of last resort by defending k
test cat-e brought agair.st a miner holding a
regularly issued license by the California De
bris Commission. Â»..
Resolved, That we heartily favor the amend
ment of sections 2319. 2329 and 2324 of the It
siv#d statutes cf the United States conctrninis
the location of mining claims, so that the lo
catcr shall be accorded a reasonable time with
in which to finally ma'k his surface boundaries
on the ground, bo that all local rules, resrula-
Territorial law on the locations of minlrg
claims ehall be abolished, and go that while
liberal pttnrtsien shall be made for the pro
tection of the locator who holds and works his
claim ln good faith, the law concerning annual
assessment ehall most effectually check the
present Injurious practice of holding mining
claims year after year without development.
Resolved, That in the problem of remedying
the criminal abuses of the land and mining
laws cf the nation by the wholesale attempts to
secure as agricultural lands, by the use of so
called rorir> and otherwise, great tracts of tl.e
public domain that are unquestionably mineral
in character and which are recognized as min
eral by th<? people who stek to secure them as
euth by subterfuge, legal technicalities and
outright perjury, the i>etroleum industry faces
the matter of mest serious present concern to
it in its relation to the Federal laws and their
administration. We believe that this problem
is r>ecu!iarly one in which the whole mining
Industry of the State is interested together with
the pftroleum miners, ar.d we solemnly pledge
our highest endeavors to protect the heritage of
the miner ln the puh'.ic domain in accordance
with the letter and spirit of the beneficent laws
which were intended by Congress to sacredly
{.reserve the vast mineral resources of the pub
lic domain to the mining' industry that their
development might be encouraged and fos
terfd. We distinctly favor the proposition that
where a contest takes place between a scrlpper
and a miner in any department of the United
States Land Office the burden of proot shall
be placed upon the scripper and not on the
miner.
Resolved. That one of the most important
Â¦n<1 feasible remedies for the said abuses of the
rights cf the oil miner on the public domain
would be found in the law unsuccessfully pro
posed to Congress during its last session, by
which the location of petroleum placer claims
Amicable Election Ends in His Preferment by Acclamation â The Report of

Association in an effort to secure the do
partment. The resolutions continue:
Resolved. That we deem it the duty of- this
convention to place itseir on record ln favor of
liberal encouragement and protection to all
legitimate mining Interests and pledge our-
Belves to assist ln every reasonable manner
any and all leKislation, state or national, which
Is calculated to remedy existing wrongs.
Resolved. That we recognize the gross Injus
tice of permitting that class of lan.i pirates,
which by claiming land to be suited for agri
cultural purposes that is manifestly and essen
tially unttt for any uses except mining, to at
tempt to wrest from purchasers of State land
their recognized e<iultuble rights, and through
perjury and distorted Interpretation of the land
laws of the State, to place serious obstacles
ln the way of large investments of money and
Important oil developments.
Resolved. That we look forward with pardon
able pride to the early construction, already
assured, of the restraining barriers for
which $300,000 have been appropriated by
our State and national Governments. We
heartily approve the plans and recommenda
tions of the California Debris Commission Tor
the construction of such restraining barriers
as outlined ln their official report of 1899 to
the Secretary of War, and we hereby Instruct
our committee upon legislation to use all hon
orable means to secure such added legislation
and appropriation aa may be necessary on tin
part of the State and national Governments
to carry such work to a final and successful
completion.
Resolved, by this convention, that we earnest
ly request our legislators to be liberal ln their
appropriation for the support of the Mining
Bureau.
Resolved, That we recognize the fact that
the future development of the State depends
in a large measure upon the future develop
ment of its water resources and the preserva
tion of Its forests; therefore, we fa\-or the Im
mediate and thorough Investigation of and re
port on our water resources and the best meth
ods of lmrrovlrgr and developing the same; the
collaboration of the Federal and State govern
ments ln such Investigations; and the proper
appropriations therefor by our State Legisla
ture.
We desire and urge upon the Federal Govern
ment that all public forests bo reserved from
sale, and the establishment of a forest patror.
ar.d v.-e favor the enactment by the State Legis
lature of such penal laws as will lessen the
danger from forest fires.
Resolved, That this association again ex
presses its deep satisfaction at the Justice cf the
policy and action of the Commissioner of the
General Land Office, Hon. Blnger Hermann, ln
his suspension from agricultural entry of a
large area of probable oil lands in this State,
pending an impartial Investigation of their
mineral or non-mineral character, thereby pre
serving to the oil miners the mining lights
which are theirs by both the letter and the
spirit of the laws. ,. \
Resolved. That this association holds Itself
greatly Indebted to the public press of San
Francisco and the mining counties for the as-
Flstance it has given not only to the associa
tion, but to the mining industry of California
during the last year.
Resolved That this association Is under deep
obligations to the merchants, manufacturers
and business men of San Francisco for their
Kenerous financial aid during the last and pre
vious years and recognizes the fact that with
out this special assistance it would have been
unable to accomplish one-half of what has |
b<>en done. The association is free to acknowl
edge this, since the largest proportion pf the
funds received has come from these gentlemen,
who are only indirectly Interested in the min
ing industry.
An attempt was made by Aubury to
have a resolution bringing the matter of
freight rates on ore and oil to the atten
tion of the railroad commission, but ni3
resolution was not adopted.
During the day Colonel Heuer, head of
the Debris Commission, was asked to ad
dress the convention. He said:
The question most frequently on the lips of
tho miners Is: "Where Is that SMO.oOO appro
priated for the dam.,?" I'll tell you There
has not been one cent drawn from it. The
Stato has spent nothing for the preliminary
work. You'll eet your dams and they 11 im
pound debris: and while I don't say they will
allow the resumption of hydraulic mining. I
do believÂ« that they will prove so effective that
in time you can turn your mines loose.
It was well Into the afternoon when the
election had been completed, and then
complimentary resolutions were passed
back and forth, among them one thanking
the president and secretary. W. C. Ral
ston and E. H. Benjamin, for the efflcent
services they had rendered during the last
year- and ln further recognition of his
worth it was ordered that hereafter the
secretary be paid a "liberal salary.
Then the convention adjourned sine die.

As far as I have observed Peruna is
the finest tonic any man or woman
can use who is weak from the after ef-
fects of any serious illness.
I have seen it used in a number of con-
valescent cases and have seen several
other tonics u?ed, but I found that those
who used Peruna had the quickest re-
lief. It seems to restore vitality, in-
crease bodily vigor and renew health and
strength in a wonderfully short time.
MRS. KATE TAYLOR.
People recovering from the effects of
typhoid fever, malarial fever, bilious
fever and other affections of the autumn
will find Peruna exactly suited to the
case.
Any one who takes Peruna is sure to
have a good appetite and digestion. After
all it is food and digestion that build any
one up. No on* can gain strength that la
good for anything on medicine alone. All
that medicine can be made to do is to as-
sist in the proper assimilation of nour-
ishing food.
This is exactly what Peruna will do.
Thousands of people testify to its merits
in this particular. Old invalids of all
sorts who are all run down for want of
proper nutrition will also find Peruna a
godsend.
Mr. 0. S. McQuillan Cured of Catarrh
of the Head, Throat, Stomach and
Kidneys by Peruna After All â¢
Hope Was Gone.
Mr. O. S. McQuillan of Spring Hill,
Iowa, writes: "Four years ago last fall
my stomach, without any previous warn-
ing, refused to perform its functions, and
I soon lost strength: food was forced
through my stomach by using cathartics.
"With flesh wasted away, strength ex-
hausted so that it took all ray energy
to even get into a bath t^b. hopes all
gone, I saw Peruna advertised. I wrote
to Dr. llartman, who told me that ca-
tarrh had possession of my head, throat,
stomach and kidneys.
"1 began to take Peruna. In a short
time I ate nourishing food, and the piles,
kidney trouble and constipation all dis-
appeared. Flesh, strength and a splen-
did appetite returned and I went to
work."
Mr. W. W. Strasler Cured by Peruna
of Systemic Catarrh After Three
Physicians had Given Him Up.
Mr. W. W. Strasler, Corry. Pa., writes:
"I had tried three of the best physicians
ln Indiana County and spent a erre.it deal
of money, all to no effect. My friends said
I could not get well. I had about given
up all earthly hopes. I weighed one hun-
dred and thirty pounds. I accidentally
saw the name Peruna. I immediately
commenced taking it and continued tak-
ing it until I had taken twelve bottles.
I then weighed one hundred and eighty
founds, ana never felt better in my life,
am a walking monument of the virtues
of your Peruna."
Address the Peruna Medlcme Co.. Co-

catarrh in its different phases and
stages.

CAI/IFORNIANS IN WASHINGTON
The controversy will of course be decided by naval
men and those members in Congress who are recog
nized by their colleagues as authorities on naval sub
jects. The prospect that there may be ordered one or
more new battleships is of interest to us, because vre
are entitled to have flich a ship constructed in Cali
fornia shipyards and named California. The plan for
giving that name to a cruiser is one agrainst which our
delegates in Congress should protest, in the name of
the State.
Many arguments are urged in favor of the smaller
vessels. It is said there are now authorized more first
class battleships and cruisers than can be constructed
in our shipyards in five years, that the smaller ves
sels could be built in the lesser shipyards of the coun
try, that two or three such vessels could be built for
the cost of one battleship, and, finally, that it would
be easier to furnish them with officers and men.
The question would appear to be one for experts
to decide, but it happens the experts do not agree. It
is reported that the board of construction of the Navy
Department, with the possible exception of Admiral
Hichborn, favors the construction of three additional
battleships, while others in authority recommend that
the entire appropriation for new warships this year be
devoted to the construction of comparatively small
vessels that could be used in the waters of the East
and the West Indies.
rROM the nature of the reports that come from
Washington it appears likely the formation of
a programme of naval increase this winter will
lead to a renewal of the old controversy over the com
parative merits of the battleship and the cruiser.
There are some who hold we have not battleships
enough and should construct more of them, while
others argue we have-as many vessels of that class as
the navy requires, and should omit them from the
programme of new work.

From all these considerations it seems clear that if
there is to be any 1 eduction of the representation of
the South it tvill not be undertaken at this session.
There are too many important issues at stake this
winter to make it worth while involving Congress,
and particularly the Senate, in a sectional contest.
The evil will doubtless have to be borne for a time,
unless, indeed, the Supreme Court should solve the
whole problem by deciding the restrictions placed
t:pon suffrage in the Southern States to be unconsti
tutional.
A more important consideration is that such an act
might seriously check the development of that liberal
movement now going on in the South which if en
couraged may in a short time break up Bourbon
domination and bring Southern politics into harmony
v.ith that of the rest of the nation. It is well known
that many of the most influential people of the South
are opposed to Bryanism and are in hearty accord
with the Republican policies of protection and sound
money. The manufacturing and commercial interests
fo rapidly rising to power in many Southern locali
ties are eager for an opportunity to ally themselves
vith the Republican party. Should they do so, the
elimination of restrictions upon the negro vote would
probably be ejected by Southern men themselves,
and a much better condition of affairs would result
than could be attained by any action however just in
itself which would renew the hold of the Bourbons
â¢upon Southern prejudices.
Against those arguments of justice and fairness arc
those of expediency. In the first place it is doubtful
if an apportionment that reduced Southern represen
talion could be carried at this session/ The Southern
Senators would be sure to oppose to such a bill all the
dilatory tactics known to parliamentary practice, and
as the session terminates on March 4 their chances of
beating the bill would be good. At any rate they
coufd seriously delay all business, and their ability to
dc that would enable them to form combinations
which would help them in defeating the apportion
ment.
The determination eppears to have been* reached
upon considerations of political expediency and wis
dom. The power and the right of Congress to make
the reduction are not to be questioned. Moreover,
the act would be fully justified by every principle of
equity. At present the Southern States have repre
sentation for the negro portion of their population,
r.r.d yet the negroes are not permitted to vote. That
gives the white voters of the South an unfair advan
tage over voters in other States, and it would be noth
ing more than justice to deprive them of it and place
them on a level with die rest.
\J HILE there has been much talk of a movement
/W to reduce Southern representation in the
* House of Representatives on account of th?
disfranchisement of the negroes in several States and
the Tirtual suppression of the negro vote throughout
almost the entire South, it is doubtful if any such
movement will be strongly supported. Washington
correspondents of many of the most reliable papers in
the East have reported the administration to be ad
\crst to any action of the kind, and now Mr. Hop
kins of Illinois, chairman of the Committee on Cen
sus, who will have charge of legislation affecting the
.-ppcrtionmer.t, has expressed the opinion that no
effort will be made to effect such reduction.
THE SOUTH IN CONGRESS.
Whether billboa-ds are to be suppressed altogether
or taxed and strictly regulated is a matter about which
it is not worth while to develop differences of opinion
at this time. The main thing is to attain reform by
whatever means is most likely to succeed in a par
ticular community. The campaign of education
should be undertaken by the press in every part of
the Union. There is not a single valid reason to be
given for longer tolerating the defacement of the
principal thoroughfares of our cities, and San Fran
cisco should vie with the .great cities of the East a3
to which will be first to completely abate the nuisance.
The New York Tribune, discussing the subject gen
erally, says the defacement may "be discouraged by
the enactment and enforcement of ordinances in the
interest of health and safety requiring hoardings to be
elevated a certain distance above the ground, not to
rise in all above a certain height, and to be of a sub
stantial character so as not to be blown down to the
menace and injury of the public; indeed, they might
also be required to be fireproof, especially where
they are of permanent construction. Best of all, how
ever, would be, in addition to these things, the impo
sition of a good, round tax. These hoardings and
billboards represent a profitable business, and that
business should be taxed. Mayor Harrison mentions
the rental of $100 as paid for the hoardings on a fifty
foot lot in Chicago. It may be assumed that . still
higher rates are paid here. The business is one which
the city would be better off without. But so long a?
it exists at all.it should be rigorously taxed."
San Francisco offers a good field for a campaign of
this kind. The recent efforts to bring about a sup
pression of the nuisance resulted in what is virtually
a surrender to the evil for the present and a post
ponement of reform for an indefinite period. As a
consequence the corner of Market and Powell streets,
which, next after the corner of Kearny and Market,
is the most important center in the city, is now de
faced by an unsightly fence placarded with posters of
all kinds of abominations. That corner where the
Baldwin Hotel once stood ought to be the site of a
magnificent structure, but so long as the owners can
get enough out of the rent of a fence for advertising
purposes to pay taxes they will probably hold the
ground for speculative purposes and make no attempt
to build.
NOW that the campaign is out of the way the
progressive people of New York, Philadelphia
and Chicago have renewed the campaign of
education against the billposter nuisance that deface-?
American cities from one side of the continent to the
other. Mayor Harrison of Chicago has taken the lead
in the matter by contributing to the Philadelphia Post
a striking article on "The Defacement of the Modern
City," and many of the more influential papers in the
three cities named have warmly taken up the cause.

PHILADELPHIA TIMESâ The people
should vote directly for President and
Vice President of the United States, and
they should in like manner vote for
United States Senators. The Electoral
College has on several occasions defeated
the will of the people; has on several oc
casions very seriously disturbed the har
mony of the nation; and in the Jefferson-
Burr struggle and the Hayes-Tllden con
test the republic was brought to the very
verge of revolution. These are the lin
gering traces of distrust of the sovereign
power of the people in the national con
stitution.
DENVER TTMES-Private enterprise,

cannot cope with the vast problem. It
works within necessarily narrow limits,
end develops wasteful conflict unavoid
ably. Neither can State control cope
with It. It is confined within State lines.

the little American contingent was Sec

who had been through the Civil War na

been given his step in the regular service
for gallantry. When the young officer
was about to leave Pan Francisco Gen

that there might be in him enough hered

excuse to precipitate trouble.
"Above all thing?. Lieutenant Fitzger

"I'll do that same, general." answered
Fitzgerald promptly. "There'll be no war
growing out of my treatment of the red

The next day he pet sail for h!s north

Fitzgerald returned the calls promptly,
nnd shortly thereafter was invited to dine
with six Englishmen as hosts. At that
dinner the American lieutenant was en
tertained royally. There was nothing in
the British garrison that was too good
for him. As he put it afterward to his
comrades in the States, "It was a wet
night."
When Fitzgerald had returned to his
quarters and three weeks had passed
away he thought it was about time to
prepare to return in some way the hos

at his disposal were a jug of whisky and
the ordinary army rations. There was
nothing good, barring that which was
in the British possession, nearer than San

Army Officer, Once Stationed Here, Who
Knew International Courtesy.
AMERICAN LIEUTENANT
OBSERVED THE RULES
Their objection to revival of American shipping is
selfish, but not wisely selfish. The new market -for
American material and the new employment for tens
of thousands of American laborers will be a direct
benefit to these producers, and when they object to
doing this by the same means they have so often so
licited for the benefit of their productions, by giving
access to market, they stand in their own light as
well as in the light of American labor and American
enterprise.
Why should the grangers of the interior States ob
ject? Why don't they ask foreigners to come to their
bins and elevators, far inland, and carry a.way their
surplus instead of asking their own Government to
give them navigable rivers and deep harbors by which
to meet the foreign carrier at the seaboard?
Of course the ship-builders are interested, and so
are the ship-carpenters and metal-fitters, and the ma
rine architects and draughtsmen, and the coal and iron
miners, the steel-makers, the inland transportation
companies, which will carry the raw material of con
struction to the shipyards, and the marine under
writers, the sailmakers, the woodsmen who cut tim
ber for spars, the paint-makers and painters, and so
on to the men who weave bunting for the flags which
will show their sheen over the world's trade carried in
American ships.
The National Grange has just resolved against any
Government encouragement to ship-building. But the
influences which control the National Grange are the
most importunate solicitors for Federal money to pro
tect the navigability of streams leading to the sea.
These influences were potent in the Trans-Mississippi
Congress, when it secured five millions to make Gal
veston a deep water harbor, to receive the commercial
drainage of the cis-Misrouri country as far north as
the Dakotas. These National Granges in seeking
river and harbor improvements are working for their
own interests, and also for those of the country. They
v/ant water transportation to the seaboard as a com
peting regulator of railway freights on their surplus
production, for which they must =eek a foreign mar
ket. When that surplus reaches the seaboard it find 5
a transportation system on deep water in which their
own country cannot compete for lack of ships. They
find their foreign market accessible only under alien
flags, which may at any moment, by the outbreak of a
foreign war, become useless to protect neutral trade.
Then thejfwould find their foreign market as effectually
closed against them as if it had never been. Then
their losses in one year would exceed the total sum
required to put American deep water shipping to an
equality with that of any other power, from which
far point it would rapidly go forward of its own mo
mentum to excel that of the nations combined.
In making this suggestion we are not unmindful of
the outcry that will be made to the effect that ship
builders are trying to get something out of the treas
ury, contributed by the Government. But we are not
disquieted by the prospect of such a clamor.
We are sure that California will see in this exposi
tion of the condition of American shipping, and of our
part of it, a pressing reason why this State should
have a strong representation at the Georgia conven
tion. Our Senators snd Representatives should be
delegated to that meeting and our commercial bodies
should be represented *by men wise in our ship
building and seafaring interests. By all means a rep
resentative of every ship-building plant on the coast
should go.
In addition to our ninety-seven steamships of over
1000 tons we have in our foreign trade 125 square
rigged sailing ships of over 1000 tons each. Of our
total deep water and coasting tonnage the Pacific
Coast, including the reregistered tonnage of Hawaii,
has only 612.004 tons! An investigation will show, we
believe, that our Pacific deep water tonnage is below
that of Japan!
Since then our decadence in deep water tonnage
has been rapid. The Commissioner reports that we
are practically restricted for carrying our foreign trad.:
under our own flag to ninety-seven registered steam
ships, with a total of 260.320 tons. But Japan has
eighty-three ocean steamers with a total of 286,200
tons! And, let it be remembered, Japan is in the Pa
cific. She is competing with us on that part of the
blue water where the future increase of maritime com
merce is to be.
Between the beginning of the century and 1861 we
had so far overtaken our maritime rival, Great Brit
ain, that she had to charter American ships to trans
port her troops to the Black Sea during the Crimean
war. She had begun to gain upon us after that war,
but in 1861 our tonnage still equaled hers and ex
ceeded that of France and Germany combined.
One hundred years ago our deep water tonnage en
gaged in foreign trade was 669,921 tons, owned by the
original thirteen colonies. The same States now own
only 482,907 tons! This means that New Hampshire,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New
York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia,
North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Penn
sylvania, the original thirteen, all maritime States, and
having within their borders the great seaports, Bos
ton, New York. Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston.
Savannah and all the secondary harbors between Sa
vannah and Portsmouth, have to-day 187,014 less tons
of shipping than they had at the beginning of our con
stitutional period!
But this comparison of gross tonnage does not tell
it all. Of our present total tonnage that engaged in
the blue water trade, foreign commerce, is 816,795
tons! It carried in the last fiscal year only 9 per
cent of our external commerce!
The report shows that while we have a total ton
nage amounting to 5,164,840 gross tons, represented
by 23,333 vessels, our maximum tonnage in 1861 was
S,S39,8i3 tons, so that we have 374,973 less tons than
we had thirty-nine years ago!
THE report of the Commissioner of Navigation,
following so closely upon the call of Georgia's
Governor for a convention of the maritime
States, will furnish to the people all the explanation
that call needs.
OUR DECADENT SHIPPING.
Roberts is of course a man of a character widely
different from that of Weyler. and his troops have
been guilty of none of those atrocities which in Cuba
aroused the indignation of the civilized world.
Nevertheless he has now to front a situation like that
of Weyler, and has found it necessary to be harsh.
It is not strange that the much condemned Spaniard
should enjoy the situation and give the British critics
a dose ,of the medicine they gave him.
The London Chronicle in commenting on the situa
tion says: "The British troops are loudly accused of
making war on women because many women who
helped the enemy in their native places have been sent
elsewhere. We must expect this irrational charge to'
be repeated with even greater vigor if the fighting
burghers, who have been praised for releasing prison
ers they cannot feed, are required to provide for thci
own flesh and blood. These recriminations are in
evitable in the kind of scuffle into which the war ha?
now degenerated; but the practical point is that the
present police work must be so carried on as to break
down resistance, and not encourage it."
The Boers seem determined to fight as-long as they
can find fighting ground. The men are in the field
and the women are in the hands of, the British, so
Roberts has to feed the women while the men fight.
A short time ago he became tired of that sort of thing
and sent a large number of women into the Boer
lines. A correspondent of the London Times says
the Boer women are satisfied with their position.
They do not wish their brothers, their husbands and
sons to give up, and the Boers would rather face
British guns than their womankind.

SANTA FE'S ANNUAL MEETING.
It is safe to say, however, that if Fill
more Is convinced that it Is the will of a
majority of the yardmen throughout the
division that the schedule come before
him independent of the trainmen's asso
ciation he will reconsider the matter and
grant the desired audience.'
Pillmore has always believed in the ma
jority ruling, hence his action yesterday.
What action the San Francisco and
Oakland yardmen will now take remains
to be seen. They may again request an
audience with Fillmore, but if the sched
uie for the coast division has already
been made up it is not likely that a special
one would bo prepared for the benefit of
the local men. In case the yardmen here
and in Oakland are able to enlist the sym
pathy of switchmen all over the division,
then serious complications might arise.
One of the natural results would be a
light for supremacy between the train
men's association and the National
Switchmen's Union. The former Is a long
established, rich organization, with more
than 40,000 members, while the latter is
only about two years old, with limited
financial backing.
Manager Fillmore was at first disposed
to grant the switchmen a separate near
ing, but it is said that since the grand
officers came here Killmore has been made
to see that a majority of the switchmen
on the coast lines are in harmony with
the trainmen's association and are willing
to accept whatever schedule is prepared
under the association's direction.
Manager J. A. Fillmore of the Southern
Pacific has agreed to a new schedule of
wages and working hours for the yard
men In the company's employ on the Pa
cific division. The new schedule does not
call for any sweeping changes. The docu
ment came before Fillmore for his final
approval at the session of railroad dele
gates and Grand Officers Clark and Lee
yesterday, and it was practically agreed
that the schedule as offered should stand.
Just how this action will strike the
yardmen In this city and Oakland remain 3
to be seen. For the! last two weeks they
have been clamoring for an audience with
Killmore independent of the trainmen's
and conductors' associations. The yard
men, who include the switchmen and their
assistants, decided that their organization
was not getting proper representation at
the conference, so tney bolted the train
men s association, with which they had
for years been identified.

MARRY AMID
PINK BLOSSOMS
Miss Emma Lake Hunt and
Harry Rice Bostwick
Are Made One.
In the midst of a wealth of rare pink
blossoms and a luxurious riot of ferns
and palms Miss Emma Lake Hunt and
Harry Rice Bostwick were married last
evening at the residence of the bride'3
mother, 1715 Geary street.
It was one of the prettiest weddings of
the early season. The company, though
limited in number, was a magnificent one,
the dress of the fair young bride one of
the handsomest that maid ever stepped
to the altar in and the presents formed a
Eplendid collection of jewels, rare bric-a
brac, delicate faience and magnificent sil
ver.
At 8:30 o'clock the young couple faced
Rev. Father Jones of the Dominican
Church and exchanged the vows that
made them man and wife. The bride was
attended by her sister,* Mrs. J. F. Moro
ney, who officiated as matron of honor.
Frank Somers was best man. The bride's
gown was a magnificent confection of
Duchesse lace. Mrs. Moroney was attired
in blue chiffon trimmed with rare old lace.
About 6e>'enty-nve guests witnessed the
ceremony. Mr. and Airs. Bostwick will
leave this morning in their private car for
a three months' Eastern tour. They will
then proceed to Korea, where the groom
has large railroad interests and will re
main there for two years, after 'which a
tour of the â¢world is contemplated.

Caught Tapping- the Register.
NelBoh Chaffer, an eleven-year-olJ boy,
was caught in the act of tapping the cash
register at the grocery store of H. Btel
bing at Twenty-ninth and- Noe streets
yesterday. The youngster went behind
old In the expansion of our trade.
Captain Charles Nelson, president of the
Chamber of Commerce, spoke briefly, ad
vocating the execution or the lease. He
said that no man could foresee the ex
tent of frontage and wharfage that would
be required twenty years hence to accom
modate the shipping coming into this port.
It rested with the Commissioners, he said,
to provide docking facilities and to give
an impetus to the shipping trade by mak
ing development in that direction possible.
Irving M. Scott was called upon. He said:
I advocate the execution of the lensÂ» for
the reason that it is a means of securing a;i
extension of shipping facilltlew much needed
by San Francisco. You cannot get those ad
ditional wharves as soon as they will be needed.
They are needed now. Since June of this year
vessels aggregating 250.000 tons intended for
use on the Pacific have been contracted for.
find during the year ending June 30 vessels were
finished or contracted for aggregating 350.000
tons. Among these were seventy-six st?amtÂ»\-s,
of which ten are ot 10,000 tons each.
Hill is having two monster steamers of 33,000
tone loaded displacement built, the Pacific
Mall two of 18,000 tons displacement and there
are on the ways In this city two steamt'.ra of
18.600 tons loaded displacement for thÂ« Ameri
can-Hawaiian Steamship Company. John D.
Spreckels is having three steamers of 6000 tens
each built. Captain Dollar hag a large steamer
on the ways and the Pacino Coast Ste*nnhip
company is building a fast steamer to run
between San Francisco and Seattle.
Now these are simply Illustrations of the
great tonnage that Is now being built for the
carrying trade of the Pacific. It exceeds many
times the tonnage now In use on the Paeltlc.
The Harbor Commissioners must Immediately
prepare facilities for these vessels. Thore can
be but one possible objection to this leas?.
If the railroad should not be r.ctlng In good
faith that would be a reason for rejection ol
the lease. But when I realize the careful In
vestigation of these questions made I.y ths
commissioners and merchants here present 1
am sure nothing exists In the leaes that will
affect public interests injuriously.
Mayor Phelan asked Mr. Scott how soon,
in his opinion, the seawall south of
Fourth street would need to be built. Mr.
Scott replied:
It Is needed now. All big things in the way
of enterprises are moving toward the Pacific.
The greatest ships the world has ever Been
are now building to plow our seas. I expect to
live to see shirs as thick on the Pacific as
they are on the Atlantic. San Franclsco'8
wharfage is entirely inadequate, not only In
number but in the size of the wharves. I
would like to call attention to another thing.
We had to send the Wisconsin 826 miles to
dock. We cannot dock vessels here tliat are
built here. The Northwest is alive to Its op
portunities and they are moving solidly to
gether. We muPt move and work together In
order to maintain the advantages our position
gives us.
F. W. Dohrmann of the Merchants' As-
Fociation said that three parties were to
be congratulated if the lease were exe
cutedâthe public, the Santa Fe Railroad
and the Southern Pacific. He said:
There aro good commercial reasons why the
Southern Pacific is to be congratulated. If
we do not give facilities for terminals and for
shipping our rivals will outstrip us. For years
San Franciscans have been pulling and haul
ing, divided into factions, finding fault with
corporations, balking the railroad when It was
right and letting It have its way often when
it should have been balked. Bo when we at
last come together and the element of distrust
disappears. It Is a cause for general congratu
lation. Â«
F. W. Van Slcklen, Edward Keil, S M
Haslett, E. A. Folger, A. L. Scott and
William Haas spoke briefly In favor of the
lease.
On the rollcall upon the motion to adopt
the resolution offered by Commissioner
The railroad pays a yearly rental of
$1000. The railroad agrees to build a sea
wall along the line of the water front, be
ginning not later than nine months after
December 1, 1800. and finishing It within
six years,' and binding itself to expend an
nually $50,000 upon it until it is completed.
Whenever the State shall nave extended
Its seawall from Its present end near Mis
sion street to the Channel-street line a
100-foot strip on the harbor side of the
seawall built by the railroad shall become
the property of the State; also rights of
way 70 feet wit'.e at the north and south
boundaries of the leased premises.
The document is eleven' typewritten
pages in length. Every possible safe
guard is thrown around the agreement to
protect the rights of the public and of the
State. -^
Commencing at the Intersection of the south
line of Channel street with the east line of
Kentucky street, thence east at right angles
with said line of Kentucky street to the outer
line of the seawall and thoroughfare established
by act of Legislature March 15, 1S78. thence
southerly along said outer line of the thorough
fare to a point opposite to the Intersection of
the northerly line of Fourth street with the
inner line of said peawall, thence across said
seawall In a direction perpendicular to Its
length, to the Intersection of the northerly line
of Fourth street with the Inner line of the said
seawall, thence northwesterly along said north
erly line of Fourth street to the easterly line of
Kentucky street, thence along said line of Ken
tucky street to the point of beginning.
The area covered by the lease is about
thirty-five acres. It Is described as fol
lows:
The lease is valid as it stands. A con
dition of the agreement by which the rail
road is required to build a seawall for the
State is that the Legislature shall ratify
the lease. Should the Legislature fail to
ratify the lease that part of the agree
ment alone is void. "I he lease by which
the railroad gains possession of China
Basin for fifty years stands, whatever the
action of the Legislature or of Governor
Gag-e.
The lease was then formally signed by
the authorized representatives of the two
parties to it. Mayor Phelan and Harbor
Commissioners Kilburn, Harney and Her
old signed, as constituting the State
Board of Harbor Commissioners. Captain
A. H. Payson, vice president of the San
Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Rail
way Company, signed for the railroad.
The lease was taken to the Santa Fe of
fices and Alexander Mackle, secretary of
the Valley Railroad, affixed his signature.
You are not to be criticized for being over
cautious, perhaps. You have been a little hard
on us. but we know that you have been actu
ated by the best motives and have desired only
to protect the public Interests.
1 have talked with Governor Gage and know
that he feels Interested In the increase of ship
ping facilities here. I am confident he will
make no objection to Its execution. I want
to thank Mayor Phelan for the attention* he
has given the matter and through him the
Board of Supervisors, who I must say seemed
to comprehend the importance of the lease
6ooner than did this board.
I assure you that the company is acting: in
good faith. We need those facilities. We are
not here to make war, but to do business and
to do it in a legitimate manner.
At times we have felt Impatient over the
delay, but we now recognize that the delay
has been beneficial. We have come to under
stand the public's needs and our own needs
better. The lease Is the result of the best
judgment <jf. the men most Interested In the
city's welfare.
Herold all four votes were cast In the
affirmative.
E. S. Pillsbury thanked the Commis
sioners for their action. He said:
President Kilburn said that before a
vote was taken the Commissioner^ would
like to hear expressions of opinion from
the gentlemen present. He called upon
General R. H. Warrield, who spoke as
follows:
I am here with other g-entiemen representing
the Merchants' Association to advocate th>
execution of this lease. We aro satisn^i that
such action will be greatly to the Interest of
San Francisco. It will result In the expendi
ture of a great deal of money here an 1 will
Commissioner Harney offered a resolu
tion terminating the former Jeasa, exe
cuted July 8, 1895, of part or* the China
Basin to the Valley Railroad. It was stip
ulated In the resolution that such termina
tion of the lease should be without preju
dice against the party or the second part
in securing a new lease. Commissioner
Herold seconded the resolution, and on the
caJl of the roll Messrs. Phelan, Harney,
Herold and Kilburn all voted aye.
Captain Payson then presented the
lease, which in its amended form embod
ied the work of months. Former Gover
nor Budd read the document to the board.
When he had concluded Commissioner
Herold offered a resolution approving the
lease and authorizing its execution. ,
"The lease as read," said Mr. Herold,
"is the result of great care and thought.
We feel that it is so drawn that the in
terests of the State will be carefully
guarded and at the same time the rail
road company properly protected in its
rights in the premises."
Irving M. Scott, president of the Union
Iron Works; Captain A. H. Payson, vice
president of the San Francisco and San
Joaquin Valley Railroad; ex-Governor
Budd, counsel for the board, and E. S.
Pillsbury, attorney for the railroad, were
in attendance. All the Harbor Commis
sioners and Mayor Phelan, ex offlcio mem
ber of the board, were present.
"The lease, if executed," Paris Kllburn,
president of the board, said upon calling
the meeting to order, "will have to go be
fore the Legislature for ratification, and
that action will come to Governor Gage
for his approval or disapproval, and for
that reason the Governor does not con
sider it the proper thing for him to act
with us to-day. That is why he is not
present."
The merchants of San Francisco, fully
awake to the importance of providing ade
quate terminal facilities for competing
railroads and docks for shipping, were
well represented at the meeting. The
Chamber of Commerce committee, con
sisting of Captain Charles Nelson, C. D.
Haven. George A. Newhall, W. H. Mar-
Bton and H. F. Fortman, was In attend
ance; also E. Scott, secretary of the
Chamber. The Merchants* Association
was represented by the following commit
tee: F. W. Dohrmann, Andrew M. Davis,
Frank J. Symraes. E. A. Keil, General R,
H. Warflald and H. S. Baldwin. The San
Francisco Board of Trade was represented
by the following merchants: William
Haas, Gustav Wormser, F. W. Van Sick
len, E. A- Folger, Philip S. Teller, S. M.
Haalett, A. I* Scott and R. H. Swayne.
.After many months of delay the 50-year
lease of the China Basin to the San Fran
cisco and San Joaquin Valley Railroad
was executed yesterday. The consumma
tion, following an almost unprecedented
amount of painstaking investigation and
consideration, was reached at the regular
meeting of the State Board of Harbor
Commissioners. : -
The simplest uso of the short scene i3
that in which gentlemen meet and nar
rate certain things that the audience
must know â they may or may not exhibit
their individuality as they tell the story.
Shakespeare seems to have had to resort
to this expedient, especially in his last
plays, where there is such a wealth of
material as in the historical play of
"Henry VIII" and In the romantic stories
of "Cymbellne" and "Winter's Tale." An
other use of the short scene Is to strike
the keynote of a play at the first. Sub
ordinate chnracters prepare the wav for
the principal characters, as in "Romeo
and Juliet" and "Hamlet." In the latter
especially the tone of the whole tragedy
Is struck by the sentinels as they walk
the platform at Elslncre in the deep hour
of midnight. In "King Lear" there Is a
little scene In which two servant.? of
Gloster determine to follow the old eari.
and they apply some flax and white of
pggs to his bleeding face. This little
scene is like a ..burst of sunshine in the
darkness of this terrible tragedy. Some
times the subordinate characters play the
part of a chorus. The keynote of the
tragedy of "Coriolanus'Ms struck by ono
of the officers who come to clear away
the cushions. After the second officer ha3
told of the great things that Corlolanus
has done for the state and gives the best
possible defense for his conduct, the fir3t
officer says: "If he did not care whether
he had their love or no. he waved Indif
ferently 'twlxt doing them neither good
nor harm; but he seeks their hate with
greater devotion than they can render
It him, and leaves nothing undone that
may fully discover him their oposite.
Now. to seem to affect malice and dis
pleasure of the people is as had as that
which he dislikes, to flatter them for their
love." This Is the very keynote of the
general's character. The people are bet
ter than he In that they recognize his
greatness and are willing to reward him
but he loses all control of hlmgelf and
with ungovernable Â¦ pride banishes Rome
from himself, betrays his country and all
but brings ruin upon the Imperial cltf.
Very impressive and significant is the
following little scene In "Antony and
Cleopatra," In which the soldiers com
ment on a rumor they have heard as to
battle. -It Is far In the night-time now:
the soldiers meet and exchange greetings,
The average reader of Shakespeare's
plays is interested only in the principal
characters; the subordinate characters
often interfere with his enjoyment, and he
considers them only so far as they con
tribute to the general story. So with the
scenes; he lingers over the great passages
âsoliloquies and dialogues that have be
come famousâ while the brief scenes, the
seemingly trivial remarks of gentlemen,
citizens, clowns, etc., go unnoticed. On
the stage parts of a play must be omltte-1
on account of lack of time, and it is the
bripf scenes that the attendant at the the
ater knows nothing about. It would be
interesting to know Just how much of one
of Shakespeare's long plays was omitted
In acting; we know from the prologue to
"Romeo and Juliet" that the play was
expected to take up two hours; it is hard
ly possible that some of his plays could
have been acted in that time. Shake
speare, however, was such a master of
theatrical knowledge or technique that
there must have been an ideal stage on
which all his characters could appear and
all his scenes be wrought out. There is
no- character, however insignificant, that
doee not play his part with the other
characters; no scene that does not find
its place in the dramatic structure.
It Is only when we have read his plays
over and over ugain and have seen the co
ordination of part with part, noted the
blending of minor and major chords, that
we begin to have a proper conception of
his dramatic power. The great variety of.
chnracters, incidents and thoughts to be
found In the romantic drama has often
been notedâ truly remarkable when we
compare it with the more limited and yet
perhapB more finished Greek drama. A
wealth of characters demands a great
number of scenes. This characteristic
feature of the Shakespearean drama is
seen nowhere better than in those scenes
that bring in subordinate characters, that
serve to Increase the complexity of the
plot and yet really contribute to the or
ganic structure. No one can hope to un
derstand Shakespeare who does not read
carefully every scene, every line in the
play; It is in such study that actors have
been able to introduce a new and truer
conception of the dramatic movement of
a play and critics have found their rea
son for new interpretation of characters
and incidents.
In this article I shall not deal with the
question of Shakespeare's subordinate
characters. This is a subject which
Charles Cowden Clarke has treated fully
in his appreciative and discriminating
book on "The Characters of tohakespeare.
It will not fall within the province of this
paper to discuss the subordinate char
acters that have become attached to the
more important characters of the play,
and can hardly be thought of as apart
from themâ Roc>reigo, Autolycus, Toucn
stone. the fool In "King Lear," not to
mention many others.
We shall rather consider those scenes
In which subordinate characters appear
only once or possibly a few times In the
playâ those scenes Â«when the stage Is
clear of all the principal characters, the
story Is for a momerft at a standstill, but
some citizens meet in the street and talk,
some clowns interpose with their com
mon sense and humorous Jargon, soldiers
pass across the stage and interpret char
acters for us, servants talk of their mas
ter* in whom we are .Interested. These
scenes? are sometimes necessary from the
standpoint of stage management, neces
sary to get the main characters ready
for a following scene, but Shakespeare
never introduces a scene for this effect
alone. Whatever character may appear
is treated as if he were the principal
character of the play and for a moment
he is a marked individuality for whom
the dramatist finds a place in the de
velopment of plot and in the movement of
the play. Generally in these scenes we
are made aware of the peneral world out
side of the characters in whom the P'Â«av
centers. No action can be so tragical,
no deed so heroic, no humor so intense,
no pathos so severe, as to be cut off from
the world at large. The lau^h of a clown,
the serious prophecy of a citizen,
the honest loyalty of a servant, suddenly
reveal to us a broader humanity.
It Is interesting to make a comparison
between Shakespeare and his contem
poraries In their use of these brief minor
scenes. Suitice It to say that such
scenes of which I shall speak and the ef
fects produced by them are peculiar to
Shakespeare. The only play of Mar
lowe's that has the scenes in which
subordinate characters alone appear ia
that of "Doctor Faustus," in which the
clowns and devils are totally out of har
mony with the play as a whole. The au
thor* has attempted to produce the effect
that comes from the blending of comedy
and tragedy, but so ill has he succeeded
that some of hia admirers have contended
that the humorous (?) scenes do not be
long to Marlowe, but to an inferior play
wriRht, who manufactured them for the
groundlings. Whether thts be true or not.
one feels the great gulf between such
scenes and those of the clowns in "Ham
let" and the porter In "Macbeth." Again,
if one compares Marlowe's "Edward IT"
Â¦with Shakespeare's "Richard II" or
"Richard III," or the "Henrys." he will
see what a fine effect la produced by the
Introduction Into historical plays In which
kings and nobles take parts those minor
scenes where murderers and gardeners
and shallow wits play their part. Better
still, let him compare the "Sejanus" or
"Catiline" of Ben Jonson with "Corto
lanus." In the former we haveÂ»the state
ly speech of the Roman nobles, but how
outeide of the world of real life they seem,
when we compare those short scenes in
which citizens talk and officers and ser
vants are Introduced. Not that this Is
the only difference between the plays of
Marlowe or Jonson and Shakespeare, but
they serve to Illustrate the greater mas
tery of human nature that Shakespeare
hadâ his more thorough prasp of all the
possibilities that lay within the new
drama. If we may use a comparison that
has been so often used before, wo find
in Shakespeare the Gothic structure, as
compared with the classic models of an
tiquityâand In such a structure the
scenes that we shall consider- furnish
some grotesque bit. some airy frieze,
some dim recessâ all adding their effects
to the general structure.

Coleridge, after rejecting the porter

entire absence of comedy, "the play be

right in our general contention as to the
blending of humor and pathos (no critic

ihiin Coleridge), this would be a defect m
the plcy; the txtrtme tension of thft audi
tor or reader would be too itvere Es
pecially do W* feel the need of relief Jost
after the murder of Duncan, which is one
of the most tragic scenes ia all Shakes
peare. "We r^ach the ne plus ultra of
dramatic terror,"' Mrs. Siddons tells of
the elfcct produced on her one night wlien
she began to Btody for the character of
Lrtidy Macbeth. "1 went on with tolerable
composure in the silence of the night till
1 came to the -imagination scene, when
the horror oi the fcene rose to a degree
that made it impossible for me to go fur
ther.." Not that the scent is one of hloody
horror: Shakespeare has studiously avoid
ed that by narrating the murder of Dun
can, rather than representing It on the
stage, but the awful stillness of nature,
broken now and tnen by the scream of
the owl or the chirp oi a cricket; two
criminals, now relating the details of the
murder and now showing the reaction,
that comes with the assertion of con
science; and above all the cry that Mac
beth hears, "Sleep no more" â these reveal
a world "cut otf by the Immeasurable
gulph from the ordinary tide and succes
sion of human affairs." "We are mada
sensible that the worjd of ordinary life is
suddenly arrestedâ laid asleep â tranced. '
Suddenly we hear the knocking at the
crate, "and it makes known audibly that
the reaction has commenced; the human
has made it3 reflox upon the fiendish; thÂ»
pulses of life are beginning to beat again."
It is thus that De yulncey. in one of
the finest bits of Shakespearean criti

We feel that the knocking i3 the voice of

"Wake Duncan with thy knockirg! I

arrested, but the knocking would not be a

ately feels that he is a welcome charac
ter. "The sound of a fresh voice after
we have listened so long to that guilty
conference is a very cordial." We feel
that.lt is eminently true to the dramatic
situation that he should deliver a humor
ous spoech. As Mr. Hales says, " We
must laugh or we must die." Despite tha
coarseness of hla remarks, he takes off
the imaginary culprits in a truly comic
way. His words, however, are not irrele
vant: he Is not introduced merely to raise
a laugh. He imagines himself for a mo
ment the j-ortor-of hell gate, and he is in
a sense that he does not realize.
There are many more such short scenes
in Shakespeare's plays the importance of
which cannot be realized from a casual
reading. It Is hoped that from the few
that have boen noted some idea may be
got of the carefulness with which tha
great dramatist worked out every detail.

I INCORPORATED
THE CHANGE^ OF LIFE
Is the most important period tn a wo-
man's existence. â¢ Owingr to modern
methods of living, not one woman in
a thousand approaches this perfect'y
natural change without experiencing
a train of very annoying and some-
times painful symptoms.
Those dreadful hot flashes, sending
the blood surging 1 to the heart until it
seems ready to burst, and the faint
feeling 1 that follows, sometimes with
chills, as if the heart were going to
stop for good, are symptoms of a dan-
gerous, nervous trouble. Those 'hot
flashes are just so many calls from
nature for help. The nerves axe Â«ry-

ing out for assistance. The cry should
be heeded in time. Lydia E. Piak-
ham's Vegetable Compound was pre-
pared to meet the needs of woman's
system at this trying period of her life.
It builds up the weakened nervous
system, and enables a woman to pass
that grand change triumphantly.
"I was a very sick woman, caused
by Change- of Life. I suffered with hot
flushes, and fainting spells. I was
afraid to go on the street, my head
and back troubled me so. I was en-
tirely cured by Lydia E. Pinkharn's
Vegetable Compound." â Mrs. Jennie
Noble, 5010 Kejsrr St., Germantown,

NEW TORK, Nov. 21.â To-day" s stock mar
ket represented nothing more than the routine
progress of a speculative boom. There was a
continuance of a large and well-distributed de

been more or less the rule ever since the pres

The first hour of the market was furiously
active and remarkably steady, the demand be
ing fed eo freely as to preclude any sensational
advance*. Hut as an impression began to be
made on prie**, the selling pressure was re
laxed, showing the carerul nursing process of
the powerful speculative leaders, who are at
the head of the present movement. Buying waa
then diverted to new points, and under cover

CHICAGO. Nov. 21.--Thoush opening frac
tionally lower Â¦wheat did not show any par
ticular weakness during- the first few minutes'
trading in spite of the Improved weather con
ditions, firm cables sustaining prices. There
was. however, an almost total absence of buy
ing orders. December opened He lower at
"0}i(g'70"4c. It sold for a moment at 71. then
dropped to "O^c, but at that point covering
by shcrts was started, the demand continuing
until the price had advanced to 71*-*c. The
close was firm at 7194S71V4C.
The corn pit waa full all day. Prices were
firm at the opening notwithstanding the favor
able weather, which gave rise of hopes of
freer country movement. The crowd evidently
thought well of the prospects and became free
sellers of both May and December. In the
meantime November, which showed an open-
Ing advance of lc, had declined to â¢U't, '^c
above yesterday's closing price. From that
point it advanced He at a time under bidding
by scared shorts until 45c had been reached.
December, too, turned upward, shorts betnar
driven In by buying by the Interests controlling
the November deal and during the latter part
of the session the market showed *rmt
strength. November closed at 45c, an advance
of 3Â»ic.
Oats were extremely dull all day. Decem
ber closed a shade lower at 21*;<S21T4c.
Provisions were dull, but steady. Thers was
a good cash demand. At the close January
pork waa 7'.4c higher, lard unchanged and ribs

NEW YORK. Nov. 21.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
There was only one market here to-day, name
ly, the American miu-ket, which showed re
markable buoyancy and the biggest dealings
since the election. London bought heavily and
the public wan well in evidence. The Con
tinent was aiso a good purchaser and there
were large orders from the American Elde
The chief feature was Northern Pacific, but
Atchlson, Denver preferred, Union Paciilc and
Baltimore and Ohio were also greedily wanted.
It was rumored that' Atchlson common wouli
pay a 2Vi per cent dividend In January, but
this was scouted in good quarters. The mar
kft, however, is at present willing to believe
anything.
Money was in excellent demand, as the bulk
was borrowing on consols. The bank lent
slightly at 4H per oent till Saturday. A mil
lion of Delagoa money was released, but lt
had no effect.

A circular for Australia says:
"Since the Alameda left four cargoes of coal
have arrived here from Newcastle. N. S. W..
viz: Lamorlciere, 2300 tons; Pericles, 2060 tons;
Sokoto, 2127 tons; Cawdor. 3331 tons; total, 11,
018 tons. Not over five vessels are due here
from Newcastle prior to December 31 proximo,
with a capacity of 14,000 tons. Hence our present
fuel needs are but little aided from Australia.
The engaged Colonial coal list has diminished
to twenty-eight vessels of a carrying capacity
of 83,000 tons. Each succeeding month shows a
shrinkage of coal freight; in August last'th<Â»
tonnage list for hero footed up o\ - er 140.000
tons (forty-five vessels). But few new charters
are being reported; disengaged tonnage in Aus
tralia Is scarce, and the present delay at New-
Castle deters ship owners from seeking busi
ness. Some of the collieries cannot supply new
arrivals Inside of three months," and most of
the mines have contracted for their entire out
put Into the middle of 1901. It is a question
what will be the ruling prices of coals at New
castle next year, and lt Is questionable If any
established figures will bo maintained: they
will vary. If the present brisk demand con
tinues. The coast mines are keeping consumers"
fairly supplied, and the deficit Is made good
by fuel oil. which is .now being utilized by
some of our largest factories, which they arÂ«
Â«>nnbled to do at a marked saving In cost. Full
prices . are demanded. anH paid, for the north
ern coals, and for domestic uses extreme rates
will rule all winter.

Mrs. Elizabeth D. Lynch, whose son
William was seriously hurt by a club

It traÂ» one of your own employes who de

Officer Kenvllle remains unpunished; In fact
hn was rewarded for his brutal outrage upon
my child. Kenvillo was suspended for five
months, but was restored to duty and received
all his back salary. I am not affected by per

the fact that a police officer can ruin an inno

of manslaughter except death and go free,
while his victim and his mother are left In
destitution.
I respectfully rubmlt that the very least you

benevolent contribution, but as a matter of
right.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. 21.â Indications point
to a contest over the will of Charles H.
Hoyt, the playwright, who died on Tues
day in Charlestown, N. H. The terras -of
the agreement will not be made public
until after the funeral. The oeneflciaries
will then be consulted and the paper will
be filed for probate. -
The funeral services will be held at Mr.
Hoyt's Charlestown home at 1:45 o'clock
Friday afternoon. The pallbearers will
be decided upon Friday forenoon. Mr.
Hoyt'a will Is in the possession of hl3
lawyers, Howe & Hummel, who drew it
before tho beginning of the trouble that
darkened the close of the playwright's
career. Its provisions canno: be definitely
ascertained, but Mr. Hoyt informed his
friends and business associates before his
illness that he intended to make gener
ous provisions for their benefit. Although
Mr. Hoyt had lost money during the last
two years of his life he left a considerable
fortune. His guardian. Mr. Lyford, says
that his estate is worth $123,000. Several
of his plays are still on the road, and are
producing good royalties. His property in
Charlestown is said to be one of the finest
in New Hampshire. Considerable cf ;he
estate Is in bank deposits and. giltodge
securities and high-class real Â©state in
New Hampshire and New York.
Mr. , Hoyt's income this season from his
plays is said to have been $500 a week.
Mr. Hoyt's nearest kin are three cousinsâ
Hale Barstow of Lebanon, N. H., Mrs.
Louis Burnham of Norwich, Vt.,' and Miss
Kate Hale of Boston. None of them was
intimate with Mr. Hoyt during his life
and it is not thought that he made a very
lavish provision ror them. In that event
it is thought they -will probably contest
the will. It is assumed that the ground
of the contest will be insanity and undue
influence, though Mr. Hoyt's mental abil
ity was never questioned until the spring
of 1S99, at about the time of the production
of "A Dog in the Manger", in Washing
ton. This was his last play- and proved a
failure. His peculiarities soon - afterward
became marked and ultimately resulted in
his confinement in a sanitarium.
Mr. Hummel .said to-day that abundant
proof could be brought that Mr. Hoyt was
mentally competent when the will was
executed. No decision has yet been
reached as to the filing of the will, which
may be offered for probate In this city,
where Mr. Hoyt's business interests cen
tered, or; In New: Hampshire, where ho
maintained his resilience and where he
died. While it now seems llkelv that It
will be filed in the Surrogate's Office here,
that question will. arise when those inter
ested come together.
Many friends will probably go from this
city to Charlestown to attend the funeral.

Dr. Taylor's welcome. Mr. Maxwell was
followed by President Meade himself, who

WARCLOUD HOVERS
OVER SAUSALITO
Hill Tribes Bring Down Ihe
Wrath of Yachtsmen on
Their Heads.
To the eye of the ordinary observer no
l>lace could well be quieter or more peace
lul than the pretty town cf Sausalito,
jies-tlirg amid trees and lapped by the
gentle waves of the bay. But appearances
are deceitful. War, internecine and bit
ter, threatens to break forth and ravage
the smiling hamlet. There has ever been
a coolness between the dwellers on the hill
end the denizens cf the water front, the
Jorintr being suspected of regarding the
latter as coming not quite up to their
liigh social standard. But ordinarily the
hill tribes go their way and the dwellers
en the shore go theirs. But now and then
Bomething occurs to fan the smoldering
hostility into a blaze. The proximate
cause of the present trouble is the pres
tnce in Sausalito waters of two vessels
belonging to the United States Govern
ment â the torpedo-boat destroyer Farra-
EUt and the Fish Commission ship Alba
tross. These craft recently dropped an
chor off Sausalito, where their officers
have been made welcome to the homes of
the dwellers on the hill, who, desiring to
tee their charming visitors as often and
t.s early as possible, are planning to have
the chips anchored closer inshore. At
present the vesscis are about two hundred
jards off ehore and perhaps a quarter of
a mile from the houses on the Hill. Two
hundred yards does net seem a very gTeat
distance ior a Â«eam launch or a rowooat,
liut four hundred is pt-rhaps a little too
tax lor WignagKing with a white hand
ktrchlef. Ho tne Sausalito friends of the
officers are planning to get the vessels
etiil nearer, and to this end the yachts
men of the San Francisco Yacht Club
have been directed to take up their moor
ings to make room for the Government
vessels. It is even said that authority to
comixl the yachtsmen to pull up tho
blocks of concrt- to. masses of railroad iron
or Â» segregations of carwheels, anchors and
cables that 6trve to hold their yachts has
been procured from the national capital.
The yachtsmen solemnly ewear that
they will not etir a finger to haul these
â¢unwieldy masses to the surface, as it
would be necessary to store them during
the winter and to put them out again
next spring. The yachtsmen consider they
are entitled to a mooring ground near the
clubhouse, and that they ought not to be
put to unnecessary expense and incon
venience to gratify the fancies of a few
residents eager to curry favor with brass
buttoned servants of the people. They
Fay tnat the people who want the moor
ings taken up can go and hire a derrick
and haul them up. It is not yet certain
to what length the quarrel will go, but
the yachtsmen are expressing their opin
ion of the others in language that is more
picturesque than quotable, and the others
nrc paid to be sparing no effort to accom
plish th*-!r purpose.

Professor E. A. Ross of Stanford Uni
versity" addressed a large audience this
evening at tho Unitarian Church, his sub
ject being "The Engksh Nation." ThÂ«
proceeds of the lecture were for. the bene
ilt of the Sunday-school section of the
church.
Professor Ross devoted a good part of
his discourse to a prophesy of England's
future, but made no reference to his re
cent experiences. He said:
"The British Empire will pass through
a dangerous crisis during the next twenty
years. Upon her conduct during that
time will altogether depend her future in
tegrity as a nation. I have no doubt but
that if properly managed the colonies of
the empire would coalesce and rally . to
her standard. In order to maintain the
empire the central power must be main
tained at all hazards. I do not think that
there is a possibility of war between the
United States and England. If one should
occur the British foothold .would be lost
forever on the Western continent.
"England has much more to fear from
Russia than any other European nation.
Bhe will have a struggle to maintain her
place in Asia, with the encroachments of
the Czar's Government. The only other
thing to be feared Is a coalition of Euro
pean nations. France hates England
more than she does Germany now. Ger
many's attitude Is hostile. England real
izes that she must maintain an enormous
navy, but there Is one thing to be noted â
she makes more enemies than she does
battleships. In case of war it would take
all her navy to keep the coasts clear so
that brfadstuffs could be got to the peo
ple. The island is an Impregnable fort
ress, but war would soon reduce her peo
ple to a state of starvation because the
island is not self-sustaining."

BERKELEY, Nov. 21.-Bottles contain
ing all sorts of alcohalic liquors wero
passed around to the jurymen and wit
nesses by the attorneys for the defense in
the Chris Cole trial this afternoon. Tho
liquors were sampled by the jurymen and
a verdict of not guilty was rendered.
Cole was on trial on a charge of vio
lating the anti-saloon ordinance. Tho
prosecution introduced practically the
same evidence as in the Mary Thompson
trial, where the jury disagreed. But half
an hour's deliberation was required to ac
quit Cole.
The trial was commenced last night at
7 o'clock. Attorney A. L.. Frick. for the
defense, objected to proceeding, claiming
that the court was violating the Penal
Code by peremptorily setting the case
without giving the defense two days In
which to plead. His objections were over
ruled. A change of venue was asked,
prejudice on the part cf the court being
alleged, but the request was 'denied.
The selection of the jury took several
hours, court adjourning at nearly mid
night. Only nine men were secured, but
both sides agreed to submit the case to
that number. The jurors were William
Rowe. H. Nolle, E. Newell. John Vasey,
Henry Peterson. Henry Marcos, Montie
Went worth, Ernest Niehaus and Paul
NIckelmnn.
H. A. Johnson, the first witness for tho
defense, testified that on November 8 he
presented a half-pint bottle to Cole and
asked that it be filled with whisky. Cole
filled it with some liquid which Johnson
refused to swear was whisky. A. L.
Woodward, who said he was with Johnson
at the time, gave very much the same
testimony.
While Johnson was on the stand the
defense produced several bottles of dif
ferent alcoholic drinks and endeavored to
gÂ«t him to identify thcro. Thjs Johnson
could not do. The bottles were then
passed to the jury and freely sampled.
Cole was put on the stand and denied that
he had sold alcoholic liquor to Johnson.

Secretary Root Will Be Asked to
Make a Thorough Investi

WASHINGTON. Nov. 21.â Secretary
Root will be asked ufion his return to
Washington to take action to locate and
punish the person responsible for the pub
lication of information that the United
States has obtained possession of the se
crets of the French fleld gun.
Lieutenant General Miles, who Is acting
as Secretary of War, has determined to
let the matter rest with the reply of Gen
eral Burlington until Mr. Root resumes
duty at the War Department. It is stated
positively, however, that the general Is
determined to do all in his power to pre
vent the publication of further informa
tion regarding the action of the board of
ordnance ana fortifications. The Presi
dent and members of the Cabinet regret
that the investigation was commenced, as
It is said it gave rise to a great deal of
unnecessary talk and placed the United
States In a bad light In the eyes of Eu
rope. The belief is expressed by persons
close to the President that the matter
will be allowed to' drop entirely.

James R. Hull, the young newspaper
man whose good work , as assistant to
John F. Bass, The Call-Herald corre
ppondent in China, was an important fac
tor In Bass' feat of getting to New York
the first news of the fall of Peking, ar
rived on the Logan Friday and Is now at
the Palace Hotel. He brought with him
from China a number of valuable relics
from the Forbidden City, among them
KiianR Hsu's jatle penholder, secured from
the Temple of Kternal Peace, and two
yellow jackets worn by the Emperor.
Bass and Hull were with the Japanese
troops and entered Poking with them at
daylight of August 15 under a heavy lire.
Whon they reached the legations they
found that the other correspondents, en
tering with the Knglish troops the pre
vious evening, had sent their dispatches
off by couriers six hours before. Bass
wrote a dispatch of 300 words and Hull
started with It for Tungchow, mounted on
a Chinese pony.
The military telegraph line had been
strung as far as Tungchow, seventeen
miles from Peking. Hull's ride against
time was an adventurous one. He started
out on the imperial highway, and three
miles from Peking he was fired upon by a
band of Boxers. Leaving the highway, he
struck through cornfields to the road built
by the Russians, but shortly met another
band of Boxers. He saw he would have
to run for It. and spurring his pony Into
its full speed he passed the enemy un
harmed. Soon after he saw a troop of
Chinese cavalry on a ridge somewhat in
his rear, the officer in command watching
him with a field glass. A little later he
came upon a Russian convoy and, of
course, was then safe from attack.
Hull hastened on to Tungchow, reach
ing it at 11 o'clock in a driving rain. He
found Lieutenant Hastings of the Ameri
can Signal Corps, but he refused to take
Bass' dispatch for transmission over the
military wire, as it lacked the signature
of a staff officer. By dint of persuasion,
however, the officer finally agreed to take
it, and as early as possible the next morn
ing he went to Matao, the suburb where
the telegraph line terminated, and put
Bass' dispatch on the wire first.
The message reached Emans, the Call-
Ilerald representative at Tientsin, and ho
sent it by courier to Taku and thence by
dispatch boat to Chefu, and ffom there
to Warner, the Call-Herald man at
Shanghai, by cable. Warner cabled it to
Bennett at Paris, and it reached New
York and was published In time to be
cabled to London as the first authentic
news of the relief of the legations.
Hull has spent three eventful years in
newspaper work in the Orient. He was
with MacArthui on his march from Tar
lac to Dagupan. with General Schwan In
his trip through the southern provinces of
Luzon, and with the Macabebe scouts in
the campaign in the mountains of Ben
euet. *.

HOXOLUL/L. Nov. 14.â News has been
received here that about 200 white labor
ers have been engaged in Massachusetts
for sugar plantation work here. They
are French Canadians and Portuguese
and were engaged in New Bedford. They
are declared to have signed contracts to
work for two years at $22 a month for
eight months of the year and Jl 53 per
day for the other four months. Women
and children are to get from $10 to- 115 per
month. The employers are to furnish,
rent, water and fuel free of charge.
It is hoped by the sugar men here that
this is the beginning of a movement of
immigration of white labor here, which
will put an end to the necessity of using
Japanese, who now constitute the greater
proportion of the labor employed on
plantations.
Object to Leper Settlement.
HONOLULU. Nov. 13.â Discussion on
the mainland about the advisability of
establishing a national leper settlement
on the island of Molokai Is deeply re
sented in Ha-arall, where such a proposal
will meet with bitter opposition. Hawaii
has no desire to be made the dumping
ground for lepers from all over the
country. It appears. Judging by newspaper
comment on the subject. Steps are be
ing taken to bring this view of the mat
ter before the authorities at San Fran
cisco and In other places which have re
cently proposed to use Molokai as a place
to send lepers. Figures of the last teiv
years show a rapid decrease In the num
ber of lepers in the Molojcal settlement
and it is claimed that the disease 1* t>Â«.
ing quickly stamped out in the island.",
so that the Molokat settlement will one
dav be a thing of the past. It is feared
here that attempts will be made at Wash
ington this winter to have a measure
passed through Congress to make Molo
kai a permanent leper settlement-

against the Wilder Steamship Company
in which case notice of appeal to the Sari

holds that In this case, which was beerun
under the republic of Hawaii and decided
by the local Circuit Court before Amer
lean laws went into effect, the Supreme
Court of Hawaii Is the court of last re
sort. The Judgroent from which an ap
peal was desired was for the value of the

There will be some lively times In the
Mexican trade for a while. The advent of
the Mexico, formerly the Manauense, has
raised a storm and there will be a slash
ing of freight and passenger rates by the
opposition in consequence.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company
has made a deep cut and the owners of
the Mexico will have to meet it or go out
of business.
Passenger rates have been reduced to
all ports about 50 per cent and similar* re
ductions have been made In freight rates.
The freight rate on ordinary merchandise
heretofore in force from San Francisco to
Mazatlan, $10 Mexican per ton, has been
reduced to $3. The rate to Guaymas, Al
tata and other principal ports of call was
$12 50, but has now been reduced to $5.
The rates to Ensenada, which include
lighterage at that place, have been re
duced from $11 to $7; it being understood
that it costs $3 lighterage, which leaves
the steamer $-1 freight.
As these rates are all In Mexican money
and as a Mexican dollar is worth only
about 80 cents American money, it will be
readily seen that the reduced rates are
extremely low, and evidently too low for
profit.
First-class passenger rates have been
reduced to Mazatlan from $40 to 520; to
Guaymas, Altata and other ports of call
from 550 to $25. Second-class rates have
been correspondingly reduced. Whether
or not the opposition line will meet these
rates remains to be seen.

Charles Jacks has undertaken to find
out whether the burls of the California
redwood can be made the rage In Europe.
Charles Jacks is one of the great workers
in ornamental woods In Paris. Cabinets,
desks furniture, panels and the Interior
ornamentation with handsome woods of
the palatial homes of European million
aires are in his line. When the Southern
Pacific Company's exhibit of California
products was at the great Paris Exposi
tion Mr. Jacks saw redwood there. He
was'at once struck with admiration of its
possibilities for ornamental use. Especial
ly in the burls he saw beautiful patterns
such as no other wood can boast. He re
reatedlv visited the pavilion where the
redwood was and talked with Mr. Mills
about it. Then he announced his Inten
tion to come to California and study Into
the subject of the possible supply of ouch
burls and such otner portions of redwood
trees as he might find adapted to artistic
This promise has been carried out. Mr.
Jacks has been here and has selected a
carload of redwood and has taken it to
Pari<Â» He 5s supposed to have it now in
hi? warehouse. He said that he believed
that novelty would be an element in Its
favor In Europe. He was surprised to
find that in California, the wood which
he had crossed an ocean and a continent
to secure had been burned for firewood
time out of mind, and that In miles of
redwood fencing and the ties of railways
had been squandered enough decorative
material to ornament all the fine homes
of Europe. He has no doubt, in view of
the use made of the wood here that he
can get all that he may need of It. The
carload that he has taken back across the
ocean was carefully inspected by Mr.
Jacks, piece by piece. The handsomest
specimens only were accepted. Incidental
lv Mr. Jacks inquired the price of land
with redwood trees etandlng upon It, hav
ing in view a purchase if the experiment
that he Is to make shall be as successful
as he experts It will be. Mr. Mills remem
bers Mr. Jacks very well and says that
he is prominent In his line In Paris. Mr.
Mills was naturally gratified that the Cal
ifornia exhibit made by the Southern Pa
cific Company had demonstrated Its value
in this practical way.

Europe Are Incomplete Until

Persistent Rumors to the Effect That
Liliuokalani Secretly Knifed
Both Parker and Prince
David.
?â .
HONOLULU. Nov. It.â Practically com
plete election returns from all the Islands
show that Robert Wllcox is safely elected
delegate to Congress, having a majority
of 31(5 for the term of the Fifty-seventh
Congress and 277 for the Fifty-sixth Con
gress, unexpired term. The returns also
show the independent native party in full
control of the Legislature, having a ma
jority in each house and a majority over
both Democrats and Republicans on joint
ballot. ; it, '
The reason for the Independent victory
continues to be a subject of public discus
sion. Most of the newspapers regard the
native vote for "Wilcox as a protest
against annexation. The administration
papers point to a long period of more or
less strong feeling against whites among
the natives, an/l declare that the number
of Hawaiian* who voted with whites as
members of either the Republican or
Democratic party was more than was to
have been expected.
The appointment of Dole as Governor is
referred to by some of the papers as a
reason why the natives refused to affiliate
with the Republican party. It Is claimed
that in appointing Dole Governor antt
Cooper Secretary of the Territory Presi
dent McKinley mado the Republican party
sponsor for ail the acts of the Dole Gov
ernment during the days of the republic
of Hawaii, some of which acts were un
popular with the natives. "The protest is
against the family compact, against a
government of men â not of laws." saya
the Republican, which is an organ of the
so-called anti-Dole or anti-mis3ionary fac
tion of the Republican party.
The Star continues to suggest the send
ing of another man to Washington to look
after Hawaii's interests there, while it
predicts that the next election will see
more natives In the American parties.
The Advertiser say3 that the natives
voted more Intelligently than was expect
ed, and vigorously denies that there Is any
disposition on the part of the leading com
mercial Interests to attempt to secure any
restrictions from Congress of the suffrage
among natives.
Queen Liliuokalanl i3 experiencing an
unpleasant aftermath of tna contest, on
"account of repeated rumors that she
"kniftd" both Parker and Prince David
and gave her assistance to Wilcox In se
cret. According to a sensational atory
published In Honolulu yesterday, the for
mer monarch was repudiated and de
nounced by a number of very prominent
Hawaiian ladies at a social gathering in
the home of Parker a few days ago. Her
Majesty took occasion to converse about
the election and to say that she had not
used her Influence in any way.
Instead cf receiving her explanations as
they were expected to. the ladies present
took an opposite view and some of them
openly told their former monarch that
they believed she had worked for "Wtlcox
and against Parker and David, with the
! result that there was a scene, and the ex-
Queen soon left the house.
The Independents and Democrats are
talking of fusion now, and it is not un
likely that the next election will sÂ«Â»e the
two parties combined. This will hare the
f effect of putting an end to the dlstlnctly
native character of the Independent par
ty, and will do much towara sinking the
race issues.
The vote at the leper settlement on Mo
lokai was about a hundred short of the
number registered. This was owing to
the fact that a number of the voters are
cripples and were not able to get to the
polls. The settlement went for Prince Da
vid. No campaigners were allowed to
visit the settlement and the Democrats
were the only ones who had a chance to
speak to the lepers. Early in the cam
paign several of Davids campaigners
took advantage of an opportunity to ad
dress a large crowd of them from a boat.
CAPTAIN WINSLOW AND
STACKABLE ARE AT OUTS
Collector of Customs Eefuses to Al
low Chinese From the Solace to
Land at Honolulu.
HONOLULU. Nov. 13.â Captain Herbert
"Wlnslow of the navy transport Solace i3
at outs -with Collector of Customs Stack
able on account of the latters refusal to
allow Chinese on board the transport to
land In Honolulu. The Collector declares
that the laws cf the United States do not
allow such Chinese to set foot on shore,
holding that the circumstances are the
same as in the well known case In which
Admiral Dewey's Chinese were kept from
landing in New York. The result of
Stackable's decision was very strained re
lations between Custom-house men and
the commander of the Solace, who yester
day refused to allow a customs inspector
to go on board his vessel. He claims that
the steamer is rated as, a man of war and
is independent of customs regulations.
The controversy will be submitted to
"Washington. The Collector says that his
instructions from the Treasury Depart
ment are to allow no Chinese from the
mainland to laf.d on Hawaiian soil until
further action by Congress. Commander
"Wins-low stopped a customs guard from
boarding his vessel, but did not prevent
the Collector from doing so. He refused
to muster his Chinese for inspection, as is
the custom here, when asked to do so by
the Collector. When the Collector went to
see him about it. Wlnslow was so much
on his dignity, says Stackable, that the
matter could not be discussed.
On the evening of the 12th one of the
Chinese on the Solace came ashore in
spite of the order from the Custom-housÂ©
officer at the gangway that he should be
kept on board. He was arrested and re
leased the next morning at the request
of the ship's officers, who stated that he
had been allowed to come on the wharf
through an error. -
Captain "Winslow Is accused by the cus
toms officers of many acts of discourtesy
while here. It is understood that both
he and the Collector have sent reports to
"Washington. United States District At
torney Baird of this district, in reply to
a letter from the Collector, wrote a com
munication supporting the position taken
by the customs bureau.
Refuses to Carry Dispatches.
HONOLULU. Nov. 13.â The Occidental
and Oriental Steamship Company has
made a ruling regarding the carrying of
dispatches by steamers of their line which
is the occasion of a protest from Honolulu
business men. The rule Is that no purser
shall carry from San Francisco to Hono
lulu any letter or package outside of a
mail bajr. This prevents any one in
Hawaii from getting dispatches that may
arrive In San Francisco after the mail
closes for a departing steamer, but before
the steamer leaves. The rule in the past
has been to allow such matter to come in
care of the purser, in a stamped envelope
as provided for by the United States
postal regulations.^

squad .noticed a white man standing in
front of the place acting In a peculiar
manner. Failing to find the necessary
evidence the officers left tho place and
were met by the stranger, who demanded
to know why they had broken into the
place. Thinking that he was one- of the
eccentric characters that Infest China
town the policemen paid no attention to
him. After walking a short distance
Policeman Herring noticed that the stran
ger was following him and his companion.
Suspecting that the man was bent on mis
chief. Herring suggested to his fellow
policeman that they hold him up. While
they were discussing the proposition the
stranger accosted them, and, menacingly
placing his right hand on his hip pocket,
demanded to know what right they had to
break up the lottery^ game* Both the of
ficers closed in on him and after a short
struggle they succeeded in placing hand
cufTs on his wrists.
When taken to the City Prison a loaded

A charge of perjury against Contractor
Oeorpe W. McGinn was lodged yesterday
with Warrant Clerk Perry by Charles W.
Merritt of 1312 York street. Merritt al-
Uges that McGinn attested to a certifi
cate and under oath asserted that the
complainant signed an agreement upon
v.hich the Beard of Public Works award
ed a contract to Flinn & Treacy for the
laying of an eight-inch ironstone sewer
on York street. betw<=^n Twenty-fifth and
Twenty-sixth. Merritt's signature ap
pears on the document as having con
sented to the performance of the work by
private contract, but he alleges that the
signature is a forgery and that by attest
ing to its genuineness and swearing that
the same was affixed in his presence Mc-
Ginn has committed perjury.
Warrant Clerk Perry refused to Issue
the warrant, however, and instructed
Merrttt to return to-day at 1 o'clock. Mer
ritt was forced to leave without the war
rant, but stated that if the same was not
forthcoming to-day he would at once
"For a good many years I have been
competent to sign my own name," said
Merritt yesterday afternoon, "and al
though I do not say McGinn forged my
signature to the document, I do say that
he conr.mltted perjury in swearing that it
was genuine. I have been informed that
other signatures en the contract were
also forged. Mr. McGinn excuses his act
on the ground that It was committed in
nocently. He pays that all of the signa
tures down to mine were procured bv an
other man, who is now at Cape Nome,
and he, believing they were genuine, after
having secured the balance of the signa
tures attested to the genuineness of all.
"Contractor Flinn also came to me and
nsked me to drop proceedings against Mc-
Ginn and told me the same story. It may
be that McGinn was imposed upon by
'the man In Nome.* but he had no au
thority to swear that the signatures on
the contract, - including mine, were exe
cuted before him. I propose to put the
case through the criminal courts for my
own protection, and then, if McGinn's
statement is true, the fact will be devel
oped during the trial. In any event the
fact remains that my signature waa
forged and the guilty person must be pro
duced."
G. W. McGinn, being duly sworn, deposes
and says that for the purpose and objects af
the agreement of which the within is a true
and correct copy, he, as the agent of the sev
eral parties whose names are signed f> thÂ»
original agreement, that all the signatures end
the number of feet each represents In figures
on the original agreement were appended Ihvrij
to In his presence, and are each one and all
the genuine and proper signatures and tixurc*
of the several parties respectively.

Subscribed and sworn to before me, this Wth
day of December, 1899.
SANDS W. FORMAX.
Notary Public in and for the City and County
of Ean Francisco, State of California.
The affidavit attesting to the genuine
ness of the signatures, the signing of
which Merritt alleges was perjury on the
part of McGirn, reads as follows:
State of California. City and County of San
move to compel Perry to comply with his
demand or lay his case before the Grand
Jury for Its consideration.
Merritt eays that he \% forced to move
against McGinn for the protection of his
own home, for he says in addition to the
suit which will undoubtedly be brought
against him to recover the amount duo
for the laying of the sewer others will
probably be brought against him and
other property owners by Jones & Co. to
recover damages caused by the discharge
of the sewer on the Jones property, it
having no other outlet, he alleges.
The contract in question was filed with
the Street Department December 25, 1S99,
and permission to work thereunder was

CHARGE OF PERJURY IS FILED
AGAINST CONTRACTOR McGINN
Captain Myers left here on the Charles
ton in May. He was soon transferred to
the Oregon and then he was ordered to
Peking, which place he reached early in
June. The Boxers had already begun to
give the foreigners considerable trouble,
and when the siege on the legation com
menced Myers assumed charge of the
guard.
On July 3 it was learned that tho Boxers
had constructed barracks against the
outer walls which enabled them to look
down upon the entire legation settlement.
Myers, realizing that another dawn would
bring with it fearful slaughter of his peo
ple, provided the Mongolians were allowed
to retain their position, at once formu
lated a plan of action.
"We decided to make a charge and run
our chances of destroying the structure
they had built," said the captain. "It
was 1 a. m. when the attack was made.
The Boxers had anticipated a charge, but
supposed, of course, wo would work from
CAPTAIN J. T. MYERS, the man
who directed the legation defense

who arrived on the Doric yester
day. The captain left China in Septem
ber and went to Yokohama to recu

He has been ordered to report at Mare
Island to-day.
the front. Instead, we managed to reach
the wall unobserved from the side and
then we were on top of them before they
realized what had happened.
"During the charge a Chinaman ran his
spear into my leg, but I never knew I had
been wounded until after the fight, when
one of the mA called my attention to my
blood-soaked clothes. We killed over
fifty Boxers in the attack and managed
to demolish the structure which they had
put up.
"We had plenty of m^n to resist the at
tacks of the regiments quartered outside
the legation walls, but what worried us
most was the possibility of a double force
being lined up against us when it became
known that relief was on the way. Tho
day that relief came I was delirious, so
couldn't fully appreciate the good news.
Although suffering considerably from my
wound, I remained in command until July
21, when I was taken down with typhoid
fever."
Captain Myers says that many Imperial
troops took part in the attack on the le
gations. He is sure of that, for his men
captured several Imperial banners. In re
gard to the charges alleged to have been
preferred by Minister Conger against Cap
tain Hall of cowardice. Captain Myers
says he was 111 at the time the story was
current. He had always found Hall a
brave and efficient officer.
Before going to China Captain Myers
was stationed at Mare Island as assistant
engineer.
COMMANDER OF THE AMERICAN MARINE GUARD AT THE LEGA
TION IN PEKING DURING THE RECENT SIEGE BY THE BOXERS
AND IMPERIAL CHINESE TROOPS.
The jurors were examined by Assistant
District Attorney Deuprey for the prose
cution and Attorney Schooler for the de
fense. Captain Seymour, who arrested
the defendant after the commission of the
crime, was In court and was an interested
spectator of the proceedings. It is ad
mitted that it will be one of the hardest
tasks ever experienced in a murder trial
in this city to get a Jury in this case from
the fact that most men in the community
are familiar with it and have formed defi
nite opinions, and a large number of men
are opposed to hanging a man on circum
stantial evidence.
The two accepted were W. J. Sherwood
and R. S. Atkins. P. P. Bernhard was
peremptorily challenged by the prosecu
tion and H. B. Reuss. B. T. Lacey and II.
H. Murphy for the defense. The others
were excused for cause.
The examination of the talesmen was
chielly restricted to the questions- as to
whether they would be willing to convict
a man charged with a capital offense on
circumstantial evidence, and whether they
had formed any opinion regarding the
case from the previous reports in the
press. A large number of them were ex
cused because they stated plainly that
they had a rooted objection to convicting
a man on circumstantial evidence alone,
and others had formed decided opinions
as to the guilt of the defendant from read
ing about the case and it would take very
strong evidence to change the opinions
they had formed.

a few minutes after 4 o'clock till this

A LITTLE man, clean shaven, with
a pale cast of countenance, dark
hair and wearing a dark suit, sat
at the lawyers' table In Judge
Cook's courtroom yesterday, in
tently observing the proceedings. The
man was Albert Frederick George Vere
ncscneckockorkhoff, known as Hoff. ac
cused of having brutally murdered Mrs.
Mary A. Clute at her residence, S02 Guer- !
rero street. December 15. 1S97. He was '
triod for the murder and was convicted in j
Judpe Cook's court on April 2. 1S3S. Throe j
days lator he was sentenced to be hanged, j
but an appeal was taken to the Supreme
Court for a new trial, and it was granted
on August 13 last on the gTound that j
Judpe Cook had ovorstepi>cd the law iir I
charjrir.g the jury.
During h:p last trial Hoff wore a lnr.g, |
heavy, dark board and mustache, and the '
expression of his face was that of a man !
of a low order of intelligence and with j
nothing to specially attract attention to ;
him beyond the fa^t of his being a brutal j
murderer. The change in his appearance i
now is remarkable. His clean-shaven face ;
Fhows intelligence and something of the
t-xprecslon of a religious enthusiast. The !
deadly pallor is the effect of his long con- j
lincment in San Quentin while awaiting \
the derision of the Supreme Court on his j
appeal and he has evidently taken advan- j
tag* or the t!mÂ«* to improve his mind. He '
etudied the Bible day after day and be- j
came the spiritual adviser of his fellow '
prisoners. He converted a Chinese mur
derer and was permitted to escort him to â¢
the gallows.
Hoff's second trial commenced yesterday
before Judge Cook. He was represented
by Attorneys W. H. Schooler and R. L.
Simpson. The prosecution was represent
ed by District Attorney Byington. Assist
ant District Attorney Deuprey and ex-As- ]
distant District Attorney Hosmer. The |
last named prosecuted the case on the |
previous occasion.
Hoff's whole attention was concentrated
upon the talesmen as they -were being ex
amined and cross-examined, and once
when one of the talesmen was asked if
he knew the defendant, the latter arose
from his chair with a smile on his face,
looked fteadiiy at the talesman for a mo- j
ment till the latter said he diu not know
him and then sat down, still smiling. He
did not seem in the least nervous, but j

One almost feared somehow, last even
ing at the Grand Opera-house, that the
glorious performance of "Tannhauser"
given last week, could not be again re
peated with equal excellence, but it was,
if possible, even more beautifully heard
than before. Such work is no come-by
choncu affair, and, to the credit of our
much be-Jayed town, it was heard by the
record house of the season so far. It has
rather amazed the operatic powers that
be, so I understand, that Wagiter has
scored so heavily here,, both from an ar
tistic and financial standpoint, which cer
tainly scores one for us. With his clever
finger on the public pulse, Mr. Grau has
therefore decided to give, for his next
popular programme on Sunday evening,
yet another performance of "Tann
hauser," with Susan Strong as Elisabeth,
Dippel in the name role, Plancon tjie
great as Herman and the rest of the cast
substantially the same. We're not so Jay
after all, and last night's was an audience
to delight the gods.
Gadski was in lovely voice. Exquisitely
tender and caressing In its quality it is,
and with a warm soft note that touches
to tears by its very beauty. She Is a
rcyal maid Elisabeth, singing, acting,
looking the full significance of the noble
role.
Bispham's voice grows on one. Th<s ex
quisite conscience of his art, his Intimate
trick of suggestion, the fine finish of all
his work, its masterly balance of heart
and brain, rouse anew to higher admira
tion with each added appearance of tho
artist. 'Tis a fine Wolfram that the Vhil
adelphian barytone puts on for u.3.
Van Dyck repeated his last week's suc
cess as Tannhauser. He is ?. great. Wag
nerian Interpreter. I think possibly even
greater as actor than singer. He paints
a princely portrait of the "Wagner hero.
Mr. Blass sang the Herman part and his
resonant, round basso was heard asriln
with much satisfaction. Mr. Bar3, Mr.
Hubbenet. Mr. Muhlmann and Mr. Vivianl
repeated their good work of last wnck
and lime. Olitzka was again the music
ally pleasing shepherd boy. fehe docs a
charming bit of acting, by the way, in
the pretty part.
The incomparable overture was received
with its accustomed ovation, and a word,
too, as to the magnificent march, with
its splendid picturesque pageantry of
music and scene. It is a gorgeous picture,
the Princess Elisabeth receiving now with
royal condescension, now with cousinly
grace, now with a filial service, mailed
and helmeted knight, splendidly gowned
and coifed ladies, the tottering monarch,
the pilgrim from afar. It Is a crowd col
ored and handled, grouped and lined like
an Irving crowd in its fine picturesque
ness, and all the time the music growing,
blossoming into the full fruit of one of
the finest ensembles ever written and pro
duced.
To-night "Romeo et Juliette" will bo
heard, with Melba, de Reszke, Plancon,
Saleza and all the rest of the eminent cast
of last week's production.

The Republicans of Calaveras County
intend to celebrate the great victory at
Angels next Saturday I evening. One of
the promoters of the celebration is W. C.
Ralston, who was elected to the Assembly
by a majority exceeding seven hundred.
The orator in chief at the proposed
demonstration will be Samuel M. Short
rldpe. whose plurality as Elector at large
on- the Republican ticket approximates
forty thousand. It is no longer a secret
that Mr. Shortrldge is a candidate for
United States Senator to succeed George
C. Perkins. -
A message comes from Fresno to the
effect that Dr. Chester Rowell, State
Senator and Regent of the University,
will accept the office of Collector of In
ternal Revenue, First California District.
He - entertains no special . contempt for
this particular office because J. C. Lynch
happens to hoM it, but he does not want
any office. All he desires is to further
the cause of clean politics.
The -friends of Senator Perkins say that
he has gained beveral points by reason of
Senator Bard's magnanimity in the Port
Collectorship. When the Senators reached
an agreement to the effect that either
Horace Davis or F. S. Stratton would be
acceptable. Senator Bard magnanimously
permitted Senator Perkins to select one or
the other. The latter preferred a resident
of his own county, hence Mr. Stratton
was chosen. In the allotment of places

position of cashier of the Custom-house i

Senator, is slated for cashier.
There is talk In' political circles that W
W. Montague does not want to serve
another term as Postmaster of San Fran
cisco. Senator Perkins has Informed
aspirants In Alameda County that a resi
dent of San Francisco will be recommend
ed for appointment.
probabilities are that they will never hear
of him again after the Legislature ad
journs. Kelly had the ballot boxes amply
stuffed at the primary election In order to
make sure of Brady's nomination. The
prestige of the national Republican ticket
pulled Brady through, hence he will go
to Sacramento as the choicest bud in the
bouquet of the bosses.
Boss Kelly expects that Assemblymen
elect E. D. Knight of the Thirty-fourth
District, John J. Hourlgan of the Thirty
flrst, Edward F. Treadwell of the Thirty
fifth, William J. Gullfoyle of the Thirty
sixth. John Butler of the Thirty-third.
Arthur G. FIsk of the Thirty-seventh,
Frank D. Macbeth of the Thirty-ninth and
Hamilton Bauer of the Fortieth will enter
the corral of the bosses and do politics
for everything in sight.
For the benefit of the young Republi
cans who were recently elected to the
Legislature, the fact should be again pub
lished that Kelly and Crimmlns are in
politics for the money that can be made
In promoting and defeating legislation.
As a commercial proposition they obtain
votes for the smallest consideration pos
sible and sell them at the highest price
obtainable. A member of the Legislature
who joins a boss organization to do busi
ness in the Legislature forfeits all claim
to the respect and confidence of the pub
lic. He simply becomes a chattel, to be
bought, sold and delivered by order of the
boss. He cannot conceal from his asso
ciates In the Legislature that his vote Is
not his own. Presently he begins to de
spise himself and seek sympathy in the
haunts of the degraded, where the press is
reviled for denouncing thieves and expos-
Ing theft.
The public career of a boss programmer
seldom extends beyond one session of the
Legislature. Of the big bunch of raw
programmers from San Francisco in the
last Assembly only one is returned to the
Legislature and he wins by a margin 6O
narrow, in a- district that gives a Repub
lican majority of 1000, that his election
may be contested.
" All the independent anti-boss Republi
can members of the last Legislature who
signified a readiness to serve again were
re-elected. Among those chosen again
are: J. J. Luchsinger, C. M. Belshaw,
A. E. Muenter, Thomas Flint Jr.. C. B.
Greenwell, Alden Anderson, W. B. Lard
ner, J. "W. Atherton, F. E. Dunlap, J. R.
Knowland, John A. Bliss, G. G. Radcliff,
C. ,W. Merritt, W. S. Mellck, A. S. Milice
and H. W. Brown.
"BOSS" KELLY IS FIXING A TRAP
FOR NOVICES AT THE LEGISLATURE
Boss Martin Kelly Is eager to organize
a bunch of San Francisco Assemblymen
to do business at the old stand in Sacra
mento during the forthcoming session of
the Legislature. In spreading the snare
for the novices in the city delegation the
boss tells them that acting Individually
they will have no Influence, but acting
collectively as a solid delegation they can
control the legislation or the session and
secure the bulk of the patronage.
The programme of Kelly and Crlmmins
Is to elect Martin Brady of the Forty
third District chairman of the San Fran
cisco delegation. It Is well known that
everything Kelly says goes with Brady.
From the standpoint of boss politics.
Brady would be a rank lngrrate If Kelly's
orders did not go, because Brady was dis
covered at an obscure way station some
where between the tenderloin and the
racecourse and exalted to the dignity of
a legislative nominee.
The taxpayers and citizens of the Forty
third District never, heard of Martin
Brady until he was nominated to repre
sent them In the Legislature, and the
