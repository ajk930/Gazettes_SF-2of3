And Mr. Gaffney. shook his head in a
manner that boded no good for George
W.'Root.
He was perfectly correct in saying that
fcis experience with Root was'not excep

During the past three weeks George W.
Root has â¢ been compelled to enterta 1 **
he would pay if Root did not.
"Since that time I have been utterly un
able to get a cent out pf Root, although I
have been to his office forty or fifty times.
He always had the same storyâ no money.
I told him that I would expose him, but
he always begged for time. He knew that
I could not use violence upon him for fear
of injuring my family. I told him that he
was robbing my family In robbing me, but
my protests did no good.
An Appeal to Chief Justice Beatty.
"Finally I appealed to Chief Justice
Beatty to intercede for me! I showed him
the note which Root had given me and
told him that the Clerk of the Supreme
Court ought to be thrown out or be made
to pay his bills./ I told Chief Justice
Beatty the entire circumstances under
which Root had obtained the money from
me, but the Chief Justice told me that he
could do nothing as Root was an elective
officer and the Supreme Court could do]
nothing as long as hÂ« performed his
duties.
"Even while he owed me the money
Root had the nerve to ask me for $500
more, saying Jhat he had a' chance to buy
an interest , In a poolroom at Sacramento.
But I wanted the money I had already
given him. He kept denying me until now
the note that was to run for a day has
been running for . more than fourteen
months and still Root has showed no
signs of paying. And you may be sure
that my experience with the Clerk of the
Supreme. Court has, not been exceptional.
He. has treated others as he has treated
me.":
"But Root continued to plead. He said
that he needed the monÂ«y only for, one
day and he would give me a chattel mort
gage on his furtniture if I would lend him
what riV wanted. , Finally. Duncan said
that he would pay me If: Root did not, and
with that understanding I agreed to lend
it. Duncan's interest in, the matter was
created by the fact that his brother la a
deputy in Root's office. On August 26; 1893.
I loaned Root $513 71, which I handedto
him in a check that 'I; had just received.
I took his note for the amount, the note
to run one, day without grace. Duncan
wrote" on the back his Indorsement that
"Both pleaded with'me to lend Root the
money, but I had had an experience with
Root which made me hesitate. Just after
he had been elected Clerk of the Supreme
Court and before he took office he bor
rowed $500 from me, with the understand
ing that the loan was to bo for. thirty
days. It took me five 'months and the
greatest amount of trouble â¢ to get my
money back, and I was not anxious to re
peat the experience.
"I loaned this money to Root," said
Mr. Gaffney yesterday, "to get him out
of a very serious predicament. He came
to me with A. W. Duncan,* who told me
that Root would be thrown out of the of
fice of the Clerk of the Supreme Court if
he did not get it. He said that Root had
collected the money with which to pay
the rent of the Supreme Court quarters
and had gambled and lost It on the races.
He said that the agent of the Parrott
building was constantly after Root, who
was afraid to go near his office.

Mr. Kristoff told his story yesterday and
showed his proofs of his evidence of the
correctness of some of the main facts In
the writing of the Supreme Court Clerk.
In addition to the note, a copy of which Is
printed herewith, Mr. Kristoff has letters
signed by. Root. One of these is dated
San. Francisco, January 29, 1899. and is as
follows: ...
Still, like a Nemesis, he haunts the
office of the Clerk of the Supreme Court.
When the clerk is busy with others and
he has been bowed out into the outer
office Kristoff frequents the vicinity. Ho
has already become well known, by sight
at least, to those whose duties dally call
them to the Supreme Court. He has blue
eyes and arching eyebrows that almost
meet. He la of medium height and has
light hair, is stocky of build and has that
in his manner that would indicate reso
luteness of purpose. His avowed intention
is not to quit seeking for his money until
he gets it. He departs one day only to
reappear the next and he haa always the
same mission. o

frauded by Root and who dally demands
his money, the amount of which, as evi

came to California a few years ago to
better his fortunes and who has lost the

FER GRAVE CHARGES AGAINST THE CLERK. . Â¦ Â¦
But the appointment of his clerks Is not
the most serious reflection upon hla af-
This Is the manner in which Root makes
and unmakes tho deputies in his office.
He dismisses a clerk whose ability he
admits for one who has been under the
eye of the police and in the shadow^ of
the gravest suspicion.
"I would have kept him to the end of
the year, but I figured that by that time
all the available places would have been
filled, and so I thought It was better to
make the change at once. He will be
looked out for; that is certain, and I
knew It when I selected him as the one
to be discharged." W&$
"I have a good man in Sacramento, and
one whom I did not wish to let go. The
man I have in Los Angeles' has married
since I appointed him and he now has his
wife to support. The chief deputy in this
office is an old friend of mine and I would
not let him go, and the assistant here has
a widowed mother and some brothers and

some time, and he Is prominent In Ala
meda politics. He worked for Root dur
ing the campaign that made Root clerk
of the Supreme Court, and this, coupled
with the fact that he and Root are per
sonal friends, is the reason Root gives for
his appointment.
"I have known Boody for five years
now," said Root yesterday, "and he and
I have been very friendly. He has engi
neered several deals of importance for me
and I have tried to look out for him. I
got him a place in the Tax Collector's of

plied to the office he had to go. Since
then he has been connected with Bovee,
Toy & Sonntag. He asked me to make a
place for him, and I have done so. There
is no pull behind him; it Is an appoint
ment made for friendship alone.
How Boot Barters Positions.
"In regard to the discharge of Barnett,
I think he understands all about it. I
am sure I have his personal friendship
still, but, of course.,.1 do not ask for his
political friendship. He came to me at
Sacramento and asked me if I wished his
support, and. of course, I said I would be
grateful for anything he could do for me.
I think he overestimates his strength In
Alameda County, but, anyway, he has
been working for me for sixteen months
at $150 *a month, and I think that pays for
anything he did for me during the cam
paign.
The latter had evidently heard that hfi
was wanted and surrendered himself. He
said that he did not know what charge
would be preferred against him, but if
Anderson charged him with embezzlement
he would plead guilty. An investigation
was made and Boody threw himself on
The ugly rumors in reference to the
manner In which Root has made appoint
ments In his office reached a climax yes
terday when the Clerk of the Supreme
Court appointed XV. E. Boody as a deputy
In his office. A year ago last March
Boody confessed that he was an embez
zler and would plead guilty to that charge
if It were made against him. He was at
that time and had been for two years the
trusted agent of H. F. Anderson of Ben
Lomond, Santa Cruz County. As such
agent Boody handled a great deal of
money for Anderson, who had gone to Eu
rope for a year. When he returned he
was not satisfied with the condition of
Boody's accounts and demanded a settle
ment. This was not forthcoming, and An
derson applied to the police. Two detec
tives were detailed on the case, but were
unable to find Boody.
fcezzler.
The creditors of Root have haunted him
at his office in the Parrott building, impor
tuning him for their money and threaten
ing him with s-erious harm.. His friends
have borrowed money for him when his
credit had been exhausted, but no per
manent relief was won. He has placed
friends of his creditors in positions in his
offlce, bartering his official, gifts for finan
cial favor. But still the little army j of
the unpaid haunted him. Appeals were
made to him, to his father and his friends.
In desperation one of his creditors went
to Chief Justice Beatty with a hope of
securing relief. Threats of legal proceed
ings were made time and again, but those
who claim to be the victims of Root had
not the money with which to prosecute
them.

ot expose, ugly facts and serious allega
tions broke.
Root is accused of having- conspired to
cheat one man out of several hundreds of
dollars and of having secured $500 from
another. The Clerk of the Supreme Court
is charged with being a notorious and
shameless race track gambler, who lost
in gambling the money which he received
from the State and which he should have
used to satisfy a debt of the State. He
is charged with being a patron of gam
blers In whose debt he has been, and yes
terday he appointed to a position In his
office a man who says he became an em
bezzler because of heavy losses on the
race track.

millionaire railroad and mining promoter,
who Is stopping at tha Occidental. Is rich
In minerals and almost every kind at

Robinson has been quietly perfecting the
plans, and yesterday he stated that noth
ing but the defeat of the present a3niÂ»n- '
1st ration would thwart the consummation
of the big enterprise.
That the promoters are sincere Is Indi
cated by the fact that they have gone so
far as to survey, plan every detail of con
struction' and order material. More than
J8,00O,0GO has been pledged, the bulk ol the
money coming from responsible' New York
and London houses. In addition . to the
railroad It is proposed to construct a bis
dock at Mariveles, which is' about twenty
five miles from. Manila. By establishing
a free port there a fine commercial trade
would be secured to the enterprising cap
italists.

months to two years. A straight line has
been surveyed, the idea being to branch
out from the main road after the latter's
completion and as the country is opened

Mr. Stafford stated after the meeting

W. V. Stafford cf Oakland Is acting as
chairman for the delegates and he out
lined the new schedule to Mr. Fillmore
Â«.t a meeting: of the delegates and division
superintendents held In the Wells.-Fargo
building yesterday afternoon.
The outcome Is of the greatest Import
er, ce to the railroad men. Refusal on the
T2rt of the company to make the con- j
cessions asked rnlpht result In serious la- j
bor troubles. It is believed, however, that
the present movement will have Mr. Fill
more'a indorsement. Mr. Fillmore said
yesterday afternoon that the question was
ore that demanded some little study. He
believed in an eight-hour work day for
the employes, and if it was possible to
errange a uniform time schedule over the j
company's entire system he would cer- 1
talnly do all In his power to bring about
the charge.
The delegates come from seven different
State*. They represent the conductors, I
brakemen end yardmen on evfery branch
of the big system. The present schedule
has been In force since 1S32. During these
eight years many changes have taken
place on almost every lire owned by the
company. New terminals, extensions,
opening of new territory. Increase In pas
renrer and freight traffic and other ad
vancements have resulted In materially
charging conditions. The result is that
en scrr.e lines business has doubled. If not
tripled, and while amendments have been
made to the schedule to conform with the
rew conditions, still the schedule is far
from satisfactory and the employes have
decided that the time has come for a re-
Vision.
For two weeks twenty-five delegates,
representing more than 1500 employes of
the Southern Pacific Railroad Company,
have been holding all-day sessions Jn this j
city, the utmost care being taken to keep
their presence here a secret. Yesterday
the delegates completed the preliminary
Â¦work â¢which had kept them so busy in one i
of the upper halls of The Alcazar build- j
ing, and In a body the men waited upon
Manager J. A. Fillmore of the Southern

yesterday, that he drew the note signed
by Root last year, a copy of which is
published, and that at that time Root
promised, as Krlstoff had said, to pay
$150 on the following dayÂ» He wrote to
Root at Kristoff's request and notified
him that a suit would be begun on the
old note and Root came to IiIb office to
say that he did not wish to stand a suit.
Then the new note was made. The old
note would soon have outlawed.
"Last year I thought that I would go to
Cape Nome. I went to Root and he gave
me a new note and promised to pay $150
on the new note the day following, but
he has not kept his promise. I am try
ing hard to get my money now and that
Is the reason why I visit Root every day."
"I &sked Sparrowe for money, .but did
not get any. I had found out that there
was no water supply on the property in
Ban Benito County and wanted my money
back, being sure that I had been swindled.
"Sparrowe said he would sell the prop
erty for me. I have never received a cent
from him. I have worked In Los Angeles
in a coal yard, have prospected for srold,
have worked In a restaurant. at Stockton
and on railroad building in Sisklyou Coun
ty since I parted with my money. Root
has sent me to several" â¢ places to get
work and I have been disappointed. Once
he sent me to Ukiah. I have the idea
that he was trying to get rid of me. The
items that make up his indebtedness to
me are the $100 paid him on the San Benito
County land deal, the note of $927 55 and
the $S0 of money earned by me at hard
wcrk on a ranch ln~San Benito County.
All that he has repaid me is $40 and that
came in little bits, because I kept dun
ning him for money. While 1 was try-
Ing to get back the JSO I was out at money
and went three days without anything to
eat. The landlord of the house where I
was stopping helped me a little, after
awhile. "* ..

"Then Root sot my money. He found
out from me that I had money in bank

Conn. He told me that he had a friend
who wanted to borrow money and who
would pay 10 per cent for It and advised
me to send East and get all my money.
This I did and had it sent to the Chief
Wharfinger's office with the understand
ing that Root would notify me when it
arrived. Then Root said that his friend
did not want the money, having borrowed
of some one else and that he (Root) would
borrow of me and pay Yne interest at the
rate of 7 per cent. I did not know what
to do. I had drawn my money from the
Eastern bank?. Some one had cautioned
me against putting money In California
banks and I was a comnlete stranger,
and did not know any better. I gave my
money to rtoot. He gave aie a note, April

continued his story, "I went to the First
National Bank as soon as I could and told
the people there not to pay my money to
Sparrowe on his demand, for I had dis
covered that I had been defrauded. The
manager of the bank then sent for Spar

he refused. Sparrowe was very angry and
talked about shooting. When I saw Root
he said that he would fix it all right. He

could make money. I was new to the

NEW YORK, Oct. 3Lâ Rev. Arthur J.
Brown, one of the secretaries of the Pres
byterian Board of Foreign Missions, to
day received a letter from David J. Hill.
Assistant Secretary of State, which cover*
various points connected with the present
status of the missionaries In China. The
letter was written In connection with in
formation that Rev. A. M. Cunningham
and his wife, missionaries at Peking, were
about to return to their posts and request-
Ing that the United States authorities in
China be Informed of their purpose, if In
the Judgment of the State Department
these authorities might Interpose any ob
jection to their return to the city.
The conditions governing access of for
eigners to the non-treaty towns of ths
interior. Including Peking, and their se
curity there, Mr. Hill writes, "will neces
sarily be considered In the negotiations
for a definite settlement between China
and the powers. While it would be pre
mature to open an access to the Chinese
interior for our citizens engaged in com
mercial or professional pursuits, there
would seem to bf> no objection to Mr.
Cunningham's return. The United States
forces at Tientsin and Peking would
doubtless afford him all facilities for his
return not in conflict with regulations
which may have been adopted regarding
the return of foreigners Into the city. A
copy of this correspondence will be sent
to Minister Conger for his Information.
' Cunningham, who was in this country
on furlough at the time of the outbreak

to return to his post. He is now in San

Â¦the north bound railway center of the
city. The Governor was accorded a splen

a few remarks to the laboring people.
From the time of his arrival until the
time he retired there was one continuous
ovation." The streets through which he
had to pass on his way from the station
were crowded with people.^ _
It had been planned to have the Gov

Mr Bryan will start early to-morrow
morning for Indiana en route for Chicago.
Mr Bryan's, train made quite a long
stop at Lima, where he addressed the
crowd from the carriage in which he was
driven to the speaking place. He charged
the Republicans not only with evading
the campaign, but specifically asserted
that they had run away from every Issue.
He Baid: , .
We have reached a point where we now
know that the Republican plan of camoalain
has failed and it is too late for ReDubllcans
to adoDt a new plan of campaign. The Re
oubllcans started out by refusing to dlscu.Â«s
the trust question. They have kept up to their
refusal. They started out by refusing to
discuss the army question. They have ad
hered to their refusal. They started out by
trying to avoid the question of Imperialism and
they have kept running from It. They also
started out to appeal to the laboring man with
a full dinner pall and they have dropped the
dinner rail.
I have received to-day two circu
j lars, one being sent out to members
! of the A. P. A. society asking them
1 to vote the Republican ticket as a
I protest' against Catholics, and the
jother asking Catholics to vote the
i Republican ticket as a protest against
j the A. I*. A. Here you find^the Re
publicans, having 1 failed in their ap
peal to the people to support Repub
lican principles on any broad grounds.
! now sending out circulars appealing
j to religious prejudices. I thank God
I that the Democratic party is a party
eto which people can belong no matter
j of what church . they are members.
We believe in religious and civil lib
erty and men come into the Demo
cratic party not in order to advance
their claims against other people, but
in order to protect the rights of all
people under the American flag. Our
fight has been a fight for American
principles, applied to all these ques
tions. Our fight has been a fight for
those principles upon which the Gov
ernment has been founded. We be
lieve in industrial independence in
this country and in political inde
j pendence everywhere under our flag.
With the exception of the Toledo speech
none of the others exceeded twenty-five
minutes in length and six of them were
of only five minutes duration each. A
majority of the places where stops were
made were email towns, and as a rule
the crowds were not large. There were,
however, fine audiences at Toledo, Wau
seon, Piqua. Dayton and College Corners.
In his speech at Wauseon, Mr. Bryan
again charged the Republican party with
making sptscious pleas to different classes
of people, and in support of his assertion
produced circulars addressed to both the
Catholic church and the A. P. A. Refer
ring to these circulars he said:

Unless Mr. Monnett has taken leave of his
senses I cannot believe he ever made such a
statement. So far as I can recall or tlie rec
ords of this department show I have never writ
ten him a letter upon any subject. I am sure
that 1 never wrote him a letter upon the sub
ject of trusts nor in any wise alluded to the
action of this administration with reference
thereto. With his allegation that I made such
a statement in a personal Interview with him
that Is alfco entirely untrue. I never met Mr.
Monnett but once, and that was only for a few
minutes when he called to pay a visit of cour
tesy, being Introduced to me by his predecessor,
the present Solicitor General, John K. Rich
ards, of Ohio. I do not think or believe that
the subject of trusts or any other subject ex
cept such as would arise in general.conversa
tion upon, a visit of this nature was touched
upon. 1 am sure that I made no such-statement
as you say Mr. Monnett attributes to me. Nor
could I have made such a statement, because
it would have been untrue. The attitude and

To this he replied that he would en

FORT WAYNE, Ind.. Oct. 31.â Senator
Mark A. Hanna spoke to two large audi
ences to-night. He addressed 3000 people
at Princess Rink and a crowd of 3000 at
the Y. M. C." A. Hall. He was greeted on
his arrival by a parade of Rough Riders
and factory men. His audience was large
ly composed of workingmen and his argu
ment was addressed to them, being con
fined solely to the prosperity issue. The
men whose example they should follow,
he said, are the men. who have success
fully managed the country's great indus
trial establishments. He accused Mr.
Bryan of utter hypocrisy, and- charged
that m the last days of the campaign in
desperation the Democratic candidate was
attempting to raise class animosity and
array workingmen against their employ
ers. His arraignment of Mr. Bryan was
severe, and followed his declaration that
he had been the butt of Mr. Bryan's ridi
cule, sarcasm .and vituperation for four
years, and that now before Mr. Bryan's
retirement to private life he proposed to
give him a few parting shots.
After his speech Senator Hanna was
asked to express an opinion on' Chairman

ker's advice to Democrats regarding their
conduct on election day, but he refused to
talk about the matter. - ; â¢:

HANNA'S TELLING SPEECHES.
The Senator Accuses Bryan of Utter
And what are the plans of Messrs. . Bryan
and Cockran? Why, of all things In the world
Mr. Bryan proposes to establish a protectorate
over the Islands, including Sulu. and therefore
to perpetuate slavery, and polygamy by guaran
teeirg to the islanders these among the other
institutions and protecting them against all
outside interference. In other words, Mr.
Bryan's platform deliberately provides fpr the
perpetuation of the very evils which he and
Mr.. Cockran effect to denounce. As a matter
of fact, they can only be done away with by
following our system! â¢ *
So It Is in Sulu. We shall keep the flag fly
ing, -and therefor^ In the end polygamy and
slavery will both disappear. I might mention
incidentally that President McKinley has al
ready declined- to recognize slavery in the
Island, and therefore has taken steps toward
its abolition. Â¦*
Half a century ago there were many aboli
tionists, "sincere but absolutely foolish and
wrong-headed people, who wanted the free
States to secede from the Union because there
was slavery in the Union. Had their advice
been followed slavery would exist to the pres
ent day .in the Southern States. The only thing
to do was what we actually didâ that is, to
keep the Hag flying, and when the full of time
arrived abolish slavery.
I should like to ask them if they think that
it will help their policy in thÂ« event of our
withdrawing the flag? Of course, as a matter
of fact, the only chance of getting rid of either
consists in keeping, the flag up." We cannot
do everything in a day. Messrs. Bryan and
Cockran would be the first to rave against
President McKlnley If he now added to thÂ«
war with Aguinaldo another war with the
Sultan of Sulu.
Well, what are the reasons he gives as his
excuse? In thÂ« first place. Imperialism; In the
second, militarism. By imperialism he means
our expansion Into the Philippines, an expan
sion conducted on exactly the Bame basis as
Jefferson's expansion into the country west of
the Mississlrrii. Mr. Cockran and Mr. Bryan
have both affected to feel great horror from
the fact that polygamy and. as alleged, slavery
exists In Sulu, In the Philippine archipelago,
which is now under our flag.
Bourke Cockran spoke here the other night.
He presented Mr. Bryan's issues rather better
than Mr. Bryan could present them, yet I con
fees It Is Incomprehensible to mo how Mr.
Cockran can now champion Mr. Bryan, in view
not only of what he said four years ago, but
of what he said as late as last February, when
he 'stated that no matter whether thera was
lir^erlallam or not in the campaign ho would
have to pursue the course he did In 1S96. be

Maitre Bonnet, when applying for the
trusteeship. Informed the. president of tne
court that the Countess herself recog
nized that the expenditure had been too
lavish and that it was necessary for some
one of experience and authority to man
age her affairs. He went on to say that,
although the Countess was a consenting
party to the trusteeship, it was desirable
that he should furnish precise details. The
Income of the Countess, he went on. was
3 008,000 francs. Since the marriage 15.
000.000 francs had been expended and the
debts amounted now to 22.000.000 francs.
The Gould family had met in consulta
tion and unanimously decided to authorize
Mr. Gould to make the present applica
tion.
The debts, Maitre Bonnet said, were the
following: Three million seven hundred
and two thousand francs in connection
with the Charity Bazaar building and the
hotel in the Rue Malakoff. etc., etc.: 6.
585,260 francs on mortgages payable from
1900 to 1909: 4,293.155 francs on bills, money
loaned; 9.100,000 francs owing to curio
dealers.
Maitre Bonnet went on to say that the
creditors distrained on the Selne-et-OIse
property and that the family had to in
tervene to prevent the sale.
With regard to the fftness of George
Gould to be trustee, Maitre Bonnet point
ed out that his fortune was larger than
that of the Countess; that authority
based on affection would 1 be great, and
that no one was better qualified, as It was
George Gould who was appointed execu
tor of his father's will.
Another consideration was that the
clearing away of the debts would take a
number of years, and that therefore It
would be wise to economize and not go
to the expense of- a paid trustee.
The tribunal, taking this view, declared
As the hero of duelling encounters
Count de Castellane has an envied repu

Orlowskl, was fought with swords In the
outskirts of Paris last July. In the first

Brooks made the closing argument to the
Jury In the Ortega case in behalf of de

office and District Attorney for their
method of prosecuting the case. He
sought to raise a euspicion against An
drew Ballesteros, the hired man of the
Gamble family and also argued for an
alibi for Ortega. He said the evidence of
the defense showed Ortega was not in the
vicinity of the crime at the time It was
committed and that the witnesses for the
prosecution were at fault In their Identi
fication.
District Attorney Campbell bÂ«>gan the
closing argument for the prosecution at
3:20. He reviewed the testimony and
brought out the salient points against
Ortega. Judge Lorlgan will charge tho
Jury in the morning and it is expected a
verdict of guilty will be speedily returned.

Republican Nominee for Congress in the Sixth District Replies to State
ments Made by Ex-Senator White and John W. Mitchell.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. SI.â James Mc-
Lachlan, Republican nominee for Con
gress from the Sixth District, to-day re
plied to the charges made by ex-Senator
White and John W. Mltdhell regarding
Mr. McLachlan's record in Congress in
connection with the San Pedro harbor en
terprise. Mr. McLachlan quoted from his
speech before the Senate Commerce Com
mittee and submitted the following tele
gram:
WASHINGTON, April 27.â The hearing is
progressing 1 favorably and the delegates feel
encouraged. McLachlan' s speech was unequiv
ocal. It was a regular bombshell in Hunting
ton's camp. Covered himself with glory, re
deemed all his pledges la favor of San Pedro.
He has been misjudged.
W. C. PATTERSON.
Then he went on to say:
Mr. Mitchell refers to a telgTam that I sent
to tho Chamber of Commerce at the request of
Blngrer Hermann, at that time a. member of the
Klver and Harbor Committee, representing the
Pacltlo Coast. Mr. Hermann requested me to
Eend that telecram to the Chamber of Com
merce. I did send it at his request to \V. C.
.Patterson, -who was then president of the
Chamber of Commerce. As the telegram itself
Indicates, it was a proposition of Mr. Her
mann's and not mine, and, as the fame tele
gram ulso indicates, I left the whole matter
with Mr. Patterson. I simply acted as the
medium to convey Mr. Hermann's proposition
to U>e Chamber of Commerce of Los Arigeles
and made no recommendation whatever as to
what should or should not be done by the
Chamber of Commerce. As the Representative
of this district I could not refuse to do this act
of courtesy to Mr. Hermann aa a member of
the River and Harbor Committee.
But I am at a loss to understand why Mr.
Mitchell did not also refer to the telegram that
Senator "White sent to the same Chamber of
Commerce during the previous session of Con
gress advising the Chamber of Commerce that
in his Judgment i it was advisable to use all
efforts to secure the improvements of the inside
harbor at San Pedro and the deep sea harbor
at Santa Monica. Senator White did aend such
a telegram, though this fact has, perhaps,
never been published before. The officers of
the Chamber of Commerce promptly destroyed
that telegram and attempted to keep the game
from public notice. The fact remains, how
ever, that Senator "White at that time did
favor the two places. V'it'l%
I have never contended for a moment that I
alone secured that appropriation for Ban Pedro
harbor, but I have contended and do now con
tend that I gave my most loyal and energetlo
efforts while a member of the Fifty-fourth Con
gress to bring about that result. And 1 re
peat that no man has ever pointed to a specific
act or sentence or word or syllable of mine
that was not loyally in support of that great
project. And I also repeat that no man can
point to an act. a sentence, a word or syllable
of mine not in favor of San Pedro. .Every word
that I uttered in Conferees is a matter of public
record, and can be read and known by all men.
And I challenge any one to point to that record
and in the slightest degree Justify the Innuen
does and Insinuations of my detractors.
But the most amusing Incident that occurred
at the pavUion last night was the attempt of
Mr. Mitchell to convey the Impression to the
intelligent voters of this district that Mr.
White deserved the credit for the tjassaee of
the Dingley bill and the benefits that it con
ferred upon the people of the State of Califor
nia. If he had read the official record of the
passage of that bill, he would find that Senator
"White not only voted against it upon Its final
passage, but on the same day he made a speech
denouncing protection In general and adhering
to the time-honored Democratic doctrine of free
trade. He would find further that every Demo
cratic Senator In the United States Senate at
that time voted against the Dingley . blU, with
the exception of Senator McEnerney of Louisi
ana, who voted for the bill to protect the cane
sugar industry of his own Btate. Senator
White had the temerity to claim the credit to
himself for the passage of that bill in hlfc
speech at Fresno. If he Is correctly reported by
the daily press, but he had not the temerity to
claim that here in his own home, where bis

LODI, Oct. 31.â The Democratic mass
meeting here last night may be taken as
an ' absolute indication of the political
complexion of Northern Sam Joaquin
County. Barnhart's Hall was barely naif
tilled. Four lonely vice presidents sat and
shivered on the platform. The speeches
aroused but little applause and alto
gether the meeting was a frost. A. L.
Cowell of Stockton made the main ad
dress. J. A. Anderson presided. A notice
able feature was the . absence of prom
inent local Democrats.
This gathering implies that this end of
the county will give McKinley and Roose
velt a larger vote than any Republican
nominees have ever received here. The
"full dinner pall" is no Joke in this sec
tion. The people have enjoyed prosperity
and they are not going to exchange a
reality for a theory.
The Democrats have arranged for a
joint debate at Wooubridge next Friday
evening between A. L. Cowell and H. E.
Welch for Bryan and Frank Perrott and
A. A. McClelland for McKinley.

more of lumbermen from that place. Mr.

Mr. Woods has not yet visited Grass

SAN JOSE. Oct. 31.â Thomas Wilson,
who Is supposed to be responsible for
some of the numerous burglaries and rob
beries lernetrated in this city during th<.
past two weeks, was caught in the act
of looting rooms in the Norwood lodging
house on North First street this morning.

Thomas Toohig. the proprietor of the

In bed.
In the meantime Wilson entered another
room and obtained a small sum of money.

hour later. Toohig's trousers were lying
on a chair near the window and Wilson
evidently came back for these. He raised
the window and thrust his arm in and
as he did so Toohig grabbed him. Toohig

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1900.
MILL VALLEY, Oct. 31.â Mill Valley's poundman had an inning to-day. The pound ordinance, with all its unique
conditions, went into effect, with the result that the untagged ducks, chickens, geese and turkeys that wandered the '
streets were rounded up by Pound Master Charles Cline, ably assisted by Constable George McDonald. The captured
fowl were herded into an old barn.
The day was one of excitement in the valley. At first Poundman Cline, having no precedents to go by, was at
a loss as to how to proceed with his duties. He could capture dogs, cows, horses and evenDowd's donkeys, but the
members of the feathered family passed a hard one up to him. After consulting with Town Clerk Louis; Janes he *
bought a duck call and a goose call, such as hunters use. Armed with these, he has proceeded- every morning for the
past week to the outskirts of the town and practiced until at last he mastered the gentle quack of the duck and the
expressive "honk" of the gajider. The defiant challenge of therooster was next added to his repertoire. The inge
nious poundman here found out that by twisting his chin to his shoulder and ; contracting, his throat he could reproduce
the soft, contented "cluck! cluck!" of the street-wandering hen that had .Just found a worm.
At an early hour this morning Poundman Cline came upon" the stage. With four tennis nets carefully sewed to
gether he proceeded to the broad street by the railroad depot, where tagless fowl abound. Here he spread his net on
frail sticks. One side was against a fence, behind which the poundman retired.' Through a knothole under the net
now came a varied assortment of quacks and cackles,* emitted by the poundman/" Simultaneously from roosts ana al
loys thc_turkeys, ducks, chickens, and geese hurried at full. speed to the spot, regardless of the eight-mile an hour ordl
nance, and flocked under, Cllne's net. The net dropped and the birds were prisoners;
Those that were properly tagged were turned loose and the. rest are boarding at Cllne's barn. It will cost their
owners 50 cents per fowl to bring about their release.- '

Hoopole last night, when a wife shot to
death her husband and coolly sat watch

pouring all the hate of an embittered
heart into the ears of the man she had
vowed to love. The story of the murder
wus heard by neighbors from the lips of
the dying man in the presence of the wife
and murderess. William HUger was the
victim. He had an insurance pollejrln
tho order of Modern Woodmen for $2000
payable to his wife. This was the motive
for the crime.
Hilger was lying on a sofa resting,
when his attention was attracted by a
creeping sound. He was alone In the
house with his wife at the time. Turning
hi<* head he caught sight of hia wife with
a revolver in her hand. Before he could
arise she fired, the ball striking himln
the temple. A second bullet struck him
in the neck, and he fell to the floor.
Standing over him the woman fired again
and again, the third and fourth bullets

Important link In the chain of evidence
against the accused doctor. It was found
in Huntington's office with part of the
contents, which consisted principally of
sandwiches and several slices of cake,
gone. The detectives who are working on
the case say that the finding of the lunch
basket in Huntington's office Is convinc
ing proof that the unfortunate girl went
to his place, intending to spend the day;
that she confidently expected to survive
the operation, and that ehe would be able
to return home before dusk without
arousing the suspicions of her sister.- They
also believe that Huntington told her that
the operation was harmless and that she
could rejoin her sister immediately after
It had been performed.
To-day the inquest will be held and the
police expect that a verdict will be ren
dered against Huntington.

begged his wife to send for medical aid
or at least call neighbors, but ehe laughed
at his prayers. Seating herself in a chair
Mrs. Hilger taunted him with sins of
omission and commission and said she
had long determined to kill him, but this
was the first opportunity she had to
carry out her purpose.
For fully an hour she sat gloating over
the groans of her victim, taunting him
with the fact that she had long since
ceased to care for him and that the sight
oi his agony was the greatest pleasure
she had experienced since first she became
his wife. As the murderess thus sat
taunting her dying husband neighbors
passing the house heard the groans and
cries and forced an entrance. Hilger told
the story and his wife confessed that it
was true. Hilger died before doctors
could reach him.
I was In the house when Drs. Hunting-ton and
Hill told Mrs. McCottrey about the death of
Jennie. Fhe waa extremely put out and Dr.
Hill told me to quiet her firet and then they

to me, but he never told me of his attachment
for the girl.
Dr. Huntington was always attentive to
my elster and I had every confidence In
him."
Mrs. McCottrey was accompanied by
Robert Davis of the College of Physicians
and Burgeons. It was through him that
Huntington became acquainted with Miss
McKown. To the head of the detective
department Davis said:
"I asked Dr. Hill to be seated and he
told me that Dr. Huntington had some
thing to tell me. Huntington was perfect

happened to Jennie. I knew that some
thing was wrong and I asked, 'Is Jennie

not answer, but afterward nodded his

me that he had made arrangements with
her to come to his office on that Saturday
afternoon and he would operate on her.

Inquest Into the death of Paymaster Wil

nellsville Coke Company and the two ban
dits who were killed In an attempted
highway robbery near Alverton last even
ing was opened this morning in Mount
Pleasant by the Coroner of Westmorland
County. Harry W. Burgess, the colored
man who accompanied Holster and who
shot two of the bandits, killing one, was
the principal witness. He repeated, the
story of the hold-up as it had been pub
lished. He said that he waa sorry that he
had slain Bokln, the leader of the gang,
but that he had shot In defense of himself
and Holster.
The verdict was that Wllford L. Holster
came to his death by bullet wounds in
flicted from revolvers in the hands of Va

that John P. Opovlch and Vasll D. Iek-

sensational charges heretofore published
were eliminated, was. filed by Bishop &

Attorney Oscar A. Trippet, who repre

overruled by the court, Mr. Trippet re

Mrs. Garretson testified that she had
been residing In this city for several
months, having been forced to leave her
husband by reason of hlÂ» cruelty. She
said that he was in the habit of abusing
and cursing her, and once, on July 20 last,
he made an attempt to choke her to death.
Her brother, John H. Curtis, Interfered,
she said, and saved her from at least seri
ous injury-
Mr. Curtis waa called to the stand to
corroborate Mrs. Garret3on's allegation?,
which ho did. Garretson, he said, had an
ungovernable temper and frequently
cursed and abused his wife. In addition to

I took his word for it and said to him:
'The public will think wrong of my sister
If It is known that an operaion has been
performed,' and 1 told him to say to
every one that I -was with her when she
died and had given my permission to hare
the operation performed.
"I wanted to protect my sister and I
had such confidence In Dr. Huntington
that I believed him and thought there was
nothing wrons, and that she had died
from the effects of chloroform. So I ex
acteo. the promise from him to say that I
was there when she died. If I had known
what I do now 1 never- would have done
so. The first time I knew there was any
thing wrong was after- the autopsy. Dr.
Huntington told me then. I asked him
if they could hold him for murder and ho
said he did not think they could. He said
he could tell me nothing at that time and
I knew nothing of my sister's condition

The Neill and Tremble fight, while in
teresting enough, was free from excite
ment and palpitations. Xeill did a., the
leading. Tremble playing the derensive
game from start to finish. When the last
round had come and gone both fighters
were in good physical condition. Neill
spemed too chary of taking any chances
and Tremble gave the impression of being
(satisfied with the full possession of his
mental faculties and an upright position
at the end of the fight.
For ten rounds both men fought very
cautiously. Tremble, whose ring experi
ence is most limited, showed a coolness
and self composure that kept Noill from
forcing matters. Neill found it difficult to
land effective blows or. Tremble, and
rather than mix with a mind to end the
fight In knockout fashion, worked for a
decision. The last round was a bit of
the fast and mildly furious order. Neill
was the aggressor throughout. Tremble's
performance was creditable, his counter
ing and avoidance of punishment at times
showing a skillful eye and a good head.
The only damage done was the inflicting
of a cut behind Nelll's left ear, which hap
pened in the ninth round, when Tremble
crossed his opponent -with a stiff right.
Eddie Toy and Toby Irwin put up what
was a pretty but not very exciting con
test. For nine rounds there was a bal
lance of honors. The tenth showed a hot
ter, stlffer gait. Toy went at his antagon
ist like a whirlwind. From a minute of
flst-ml-xings Toy evolved with a deep gash
over his right eye, the result of stiff lefts
that Irwin let- loose. When the . gong
pounded Irwin was ashade or two hap
pier in complexion and physical compo
sure. Jack Welch, who referced all three
contests, pronounced ims fight a draw.
All three decisions were eminently just
and fair.
Ten rounds of measurably scientific
fighting between Irwin and Toy resulting
in a draw; fifteen rounds of a whirlwind
of fisticuffs between Lewis and Thurston
In a victory" for the latter by a decision,
and twenty rounds of tame, cautious,
careful fighting between Al Neill and Ben
Tremble", which resulted in a decision for
the former, was the card presented last
nl&ht by the Columbia Athletic Club at
Woodward's Pavilion. The house was
packed to the doors and the flstic enter
tainment was of so varied a nature as to
; satisfy all classes of enthusiasts over
matters pugilistic. â¢
The advertised event of the evening,
Neill vs. Tremble, was not the event of
the evening. The fifteen-round bout with
Thurston and Lewis a6 the star duelists,
sandwiched In between the opening and
closing fights, was easily the evening s
best morsel. How Thurston ever kepfup
the pace which he set at the beginning
and how Lewis lasted the full limit will
long be a mystery. Such a cyclonic ex
hibition has not been seen in San Fran
cisco for many a day. So little science
was displayed by Thurston that even a
microscope would be insufficient to detect
it. Strength and a 'spirit of willingness
he had in superabundance. Lewis, the
colored fighter, had more of skill, but less
of physique, and victory followed the
wild, unbridled use of muscle. This was
the third fight Lewis and Thurston have
had. ,'

name certain streets in Paris after Blan
qul. Elourens and other heroes o? tha
sle?e during the Franco-Prussian war.
M. Colly declared that the honor was
due tiiem "in recognition of their efforts
to save Parts from the shameful capitu
lation prepared by General Trochu."
Hla proposal aroused a perfect pande
monium, which the President of tho
Council was unablÂ© to quell. The Social
ists rose en masse and shook their fists
In the faces of the Nationalists.
M. Rendl offered a reolutlon protesting
against a proposition tending to "awaken
civil discord and glorify crimes agralrut
the country." Finally quiet was restored
and M. Colly's motion was carried.

/â¢Â¦': Â« PRETTY wedding was celebrated
yesterday at Sacred Heart

M \ gan joined in the holy bonds of
Patrimony Thomas B. Murphy
and Miss Helena Donovan. The ceremony
was performed at 6 p. m. The bride was

that the Democrats fully Intend to reap thfj
fruits of their victory. If intimidation Is at
tempted at the polls or fraudulent counting
tried by election judges there will b* Demo

Thf-re will be neithor intimidation at the

It will not be the honest man who Is doing
hi? duty fairly and well. ThÂ» Democrats have
made an honest campaign. We have appealed
to the heads and hearts of th? American i>eo-
I-'.e. We have wen the fight, and, by heaven,
we will not be defrauded out of our victory
by the chicanery of election Judge*. If our
Republican friends will be honest there will
be no trouble, but Intimidation at the polls or
attempted diehonesty in the counts will bÂ» met
by f-uch methods as may be necessary and en
tirely effective*.
I do not Fee anything; wrong; with that sug
gestion. Senator Hill eujrsested a. baseball bat
as being peculiarly appropriate to render jus
tice to a eorruitt election Judice. In my own
opinion the best way is for Democrats to be
at the polls when they are opened and to re
main there In good, strong: relays until the
count Is completed. - It should be the duty of
these Democrats to watch the judges and the
count and to see to it that no fraud Is com
mitted, and If 8ny fraud is attempted to stop
it then and there.

ST. LOUIS. Oct. 31.â Get away day at
Kinloch Park was ushered in with a driv

sea of sticky mud, and ushered out with
one of the most sensational incidents
known to the turf in this country. The
card was one of the very best offered by
the association, and four favorites and
two outsiders turned up as the winners.
As the field in the last race was rounding
the far turn spectators in the grand stand
were startled to see the smoke of four
shots arise from a cornfield Just beyond
the course. Almost immediately after
ward Go Out and Gulderock were Been to
fall, throwing Jockeys Bassln&er and
Kane far over their horses' heads. Cries
of "The horses are shot!" "The jockeys
are shot!" went up from hundreds of
throats and a ru?h was made In the direc
tion of the turn. It v,-a.s found upon In
vestigation that the shots had not been
fired at the horses and riders, but that
the spill was due to them there is no
doubt. Bassinger said after the occur
rence that Go Out swerved upon hearing
the reports and collided with Guh'erock.
The Jockeys were badly shaken up, but
had no bones broken. Gulderock came out
of the collision unscathed, but Go Out
sustained a broken shoulder. It was said
in some quarters that the shots had been
fired to accelerate the speed of Domsle,
one/of the first choices, but this could rot
be confirmed. President Joseph D. Lucas
said the matter would be thoroughly sift
ed and the guilty parties punished. At

EXCITING FINISH
AT KINLOCH PARK
Lord Salisbury apparently arranged
matters with the Queen at Balmoral a
week ago. His own Inclination was to re
sign the Premiership and devote hlmselt
exclusively to the Foreign Office. He
wrote her Majesty to this effect, but she
declined to accept the suggestions. Loril
Salisbury, therefore, went to Balmoral to
discuss the question, with the result that
the Queen carried her point.
Public anxiety is to some extent relieved
by the prospect that Salisbury's experi
ence will still be available to direct the
bread lines of policy of the prospective
Foreign Minister.
If the Daily Telegraph's announcement
had been a mere feeler to ascertain the
temper of the public toward Lord Lans
downe's appointment, he would certainly
never become Minister of Foreign Affairs;
but. although the appointment to the sec
retaryship has not yet been officially con
firmed. It is accepted on all sides as a.
settled thing.
The Standard says It has learned that
Lord Selbourne. Under Secretary of Stato
for the Colonle*. and William St. John
Broderick. Under Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs, will enter the Cabinet,
and that Charles Thompson Ritchie
president of the Board of Trade, will be
given a higher post.
LONDON. Oct. 31.-The Marquis of
Lansdowne'3 elevation to the Foreign Sec
retaryship, according to the announce
ments in the newspapers this morning,
has, figuratively speaking, taken the coun
try's breath away. It was as unexpected
as It Is unwelcome. Even the staunches*
ministerial mouthpieces among the after
noon newspaper^ openly denounce It. Tho
Globe declares the appointment or.ly
shows Lord Salisbury is completely out
of touch with the feelings and wishes of
the electorate and the Conservative party,
while the Liberal Westminster Gazette,
croaking over the discomfiture of thj
ministerial newspapers which have been
so loudly demanding the retirement of
Lord Lanadowne. express relief at the
fact that Joseph Chamberlain was not
given the post.

Mrs. Jerome Ellison' of Wheeling, W.
Va., writes: I suffered from catarrh near-
ly my whole life and last winter my two
children also suffered from catarrhal
colds and sore throat so much they were
out of school a large portion of the win-
ter. My brother who was cured of ca-
tarrhal deafness by using 8tuarfs Ca-
tarrh Tablets rrged me to try them bo
much that I did so. and am truly thank-
ful for what they have done for myself
and my children. I always keep a box
of the tablets in the house and at the
first appearance of a cold or sore throat
we nip it in the bud and catarrh Is no
longer a household affliction with us.
Full ifzed packages of Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets ' are sold for fifty cents at all
drucxlBtS.
Throughout a sreat nation of eighty
million it is a desperate struggle to se-
cure even a recognition for a new article,
to say nothing of achieving popular fa-
vor and yet within one year Stuart s Ca-
tarrh Tablets, the new catarrh cure, has
met with such success that to-day it can
be found in every drug store throughout
the United States and Canada.
To be sure, a large amount of adver-
tising was ' necessary in the first instance
to bring the remedy to the attention of
the public, but every one familiar with
the subject knows that advertising alone
never made any article permanently suc-
cessful. It must have In addition abso-
lute, undeniable merit, and this the new
catarrh cure certainly possesses in a
marked degree.
Physicians who formerly depended upon
inhalers, sprays and local washes or oint-
ments now use Stuart's Catarrh Tablets
because, as one of the most prominent
stated, these tablets contain in pleasant,
convenient form all the really efficient ca-
tarrh remedies, such as red gum, Guaacol,
Eucalyptol and Sangulnaria.
They contain no cocaine nor opiate and
are given to little children with entire
eafety and benefit.
Dr. J. J. Re; tiger of Covlngton, Ky..
says: "I suffered from catarrh in my head
and throat every fall, with stoppage of
the nose and irritation in the throat af-
fecting my voice and often extending to
the stomach, causing catarrh of the stom-
ach. I bought a fifty-cent package of Stu-
art's Catarrh Tablets at my druggist's,
carried them in my pocket and used them
faithfully, and the way in which they
cleared my head and throat was certainly
remarkable. I had no catarrh last winter
and spring and consider myself entirely
free from any catarrhal trouble."

The evil is one of 1.0 small magnitude. It should
rot be overlooked by the public even in the excite
ments of the closing days of the Presidential cam
paign. A gross wrong has been done to applicants
for positions as bookkeepers in the city offices by this
act of favoritism which raises one of their number
over the heads of others who under the rules were
rightly given priority. Nor is it at all likely that the
full measure of the unfairness of the Commissioners
has been discovered. Many similar frauds in making
up the list of eligibhs may have been committed of
which the public will never, be aware. There is but
one remedy for the evil. The Commissioners guilty
of these frauds should be expelled from an office they
!:ave disgraced. That much the public demands in the
interests of fair play and official integrity.
After the exposures that have been made, and the
weak and insufficient apologies offered by the Com
missioners, no citizen can have any further confidence
in their official actions; no applicant for position of
ary kind can tftke the examinations with a feeling that
he will be rated according to his merits. Each and
all will be conscious that a political pull or influence
would be worth more than any excellence they might
show before the examiners. Out of that feeling there
vill naturally come a reliance upon underhand
methods, and the Commissioners will be tempted
more and more to continue down the wrong path on
v.hich they have started.
Mayor Phelan has frequently declared that the
various boards of the city government subject to re
moval by him are responsible to him alone, and that
he is responsible to the people for all they do. He
has asserted that it it the business of these boards
to support his administration and carry out his policy.
To him. therefore, the pubfic has a right to look for
redress from the manifest wrongdoings of the com
mission. Either he must ask for the resignation of the
present Commissioners, or remove them summarily,
or share responsibility for their prejudice and fa
vcritism and bear the odium of it.
It has been claimed by the Commisisoners in de
fending their conduct that there is nothing criminal
in their action. The Call is willing to waive trm
r-r-int. Enough remains to show that the commission
was guilty of rank favoritism, and also to justify a
moral con\-iction tbat the favoritism was brought
about by the exercise of "influence" with the Com
missioners. That showing is ample enough to bring
down upon the Commissioners the condemnation of
the public. The sole virtue of the civil service regu
lr.tions resides in- the fairness with which they are
enforced. If there bÂ« any kind of unfairness on the
part of the commission, whether it be due to favor
itism, or outside influence, or any other motive that
may prompt the advancement of one man over an
other on the HÂ«-t of e'igibles, by any trick or device,
the whole value and virtue of the rules are lost. A
civil service juggled in that way is no other than the
old spoils system under a new name wearing the garb
o: hypocrisy.
SCANDALS arising from the operation of th
civil service rules are becoming so frequent as to
destroy! public conridence in the fairness of the
commission. The latest development, published in
The Call yesterday, was that of so changing the
rainps after examinations had been held as to raise
Leonard S. Leavy, a bookkeeper in the office of the
Board of Public Works, from the sixth to the third
place on the list of eligible*. The result of the change
was that Leavy was able to obtain a position to
which otherwise he could not have been appointed.

DEMOCRATIC LEGAL LIGHT OF
OMAHA OPPOSES PARTY CANDIDATE
Hon. Warren Switzler Says Bryan if Elected
"Will Upset Country's Business Interests.
ARTHUR A. TAYLOR, proprietor
of the Santa Cruz Surf, and one
of the best known Democrats of
the city by the sea. recently an
nounced in his paper, which has always
advocated Democratic doctrines and
warmly supported the candidates of that
party, that it would be unwise to favor
the election of W. J. Bryan, and gave as
his opinion that tens of thousands of
Democrats would be of the same belief
before election day.
In the course of a lengthy article on
his renunciation of Bryanism Mr. Tav-
Enjoying his full stomach, replete with Mr. Croker's
bounty at a feast which cost $12 a plate. Mr. Bryan
exclaimed in Cooper Union. "Great is Tammany, and
Croker is its prophet." Decent people, however, may
object to a national administration of which Croker
will be the prophet.
When Strong was Mayor these criminals were dis
missed from office, and many passed from the pay
roll to the police court, for they had to resort to
their regular business of cutting throats and purses
for a living. -.*:..'
It is the boast of Croker and Tammany that statis
tics show less crime in New York than in other large
cities. That is true, but the statistics are of the con
victions in Croker's courts, where none are convicted
that divide with him. He has also pointed to the ap
parent increase of crime in the city during the admin
istration of Mayor Strong. For this he goes to the
same source, court statistics. This only proves that
when Tammany was out of power vice and crime
could not be protected by Dick Croker and were pun
ished by the courts. There was another reason. When
in power Croker keeps a large contingent of crimi
nals, murderers, thieves, pickpockets and that class
on the public payroll. Being a jailbird himself he has
a fellow feeling for them and finds them useful in his
business, which is politics.
This sprig of theft and crime in politics certainly
has no complaint to make about a lack of chance. His
thrifty father knows the goddess of chance very well.
For his benefit Tammany assesses her devotees a fat
blackmail every year. Bishop Potter has recently
published the results of an investigation carefully
made by him, which shows that Croker blackmails
vice in New York to the amount of $5,000,000 a year.
Controlling: the police and the courts, he exacts toll
from debauchery, gambling and theft. He fattens on
the vice and crime of that great city. When wanton,
thief or gambler refuses to divide with him his police
ai rest and his courts punish the delinquent, not be
cause they are guilty of crime, but because they have
refused to divide its proceeds with Croker.
His son, Richard Croker Jr., has just matriculated
for a law course at Cornell University. He has leased
the Forrest place, a sumptuous country seat a mile
from the college grounds, and has installed there his
establishment, consisting of valets, a corps of English
house servants, horses and\ carriages, four English
bulldogs for which he paid $10,000, his favorite roa-.l
horse Flora and a tandem team which he drives every
morning to lectures.
Ever since Croker got out of jail and escaped hang
ing for a cowardly murder which he committed, owing
his neck to Tammany corruption and influence with
the courts, he has been advancing in politics. He has
not since then done a day's work, nor been in any
business. Legally he has been a vagrant, a vagabond,
for his means of support are invisible. Yet he has
accumulated a fortune amounting to twenty millions
of dollars, owns a racing estate in England and flour
ishes the purse of a Nabob and the style of an oriental
Prince.
IN a political symposium in the North American
Review Richard Croker appears as a publicist, and
the sole availabfc expounder of Democracy! Even
a Republican may be excused for deploring the fate
of that party, which has so fallen from its high estate
that no pen but that handled by the boss of Tam
rbany can be found to defend it in a leading Review
like the North American. In his labored and incon
sequential article -he tries to catch young men by
decrying existing conditions as inimical to their ad
vancement, and especially to their advance in poli
tics.

Says Bryan Is Unsafe to Be Trusted as the
~ ; Head of the Nation.
LIFELONG COLORADO DEMOCRAT
WILL VOTE FOR MCKINLEY
In this last campaign lie there is another eleir'-'t
that is of interest. The Hearst yellow papers are so
thoroughly discredited that even the truth published
in them is cast out and not believed. Therefore the
Bryan gang had to resort to a paper heretofore re
spectable, and selected the Philadelphia Times. It
must be very painful for Colonel McClure to have his
paper made the medium of such a transparent cam
paign falsehood and be brought within the withering
characterization which sprang so promptly from Mr.
Cleveland's justifiable indignation.
Therefore it is evident that Mr. Bryan's campaign
is on its last leg when he shows such a feverish
anxiety for Cleveland'? indorsement that his support
ers seek to get its effect by publishing "an unmitigated
falsehood, a lie from beginning to end."
What must be thought of Bryan, anyway, for the
anxiety he has painfully manifested for the indorse
ment of Mr. Cleveland? In a normal and wholesome
condition of politics what would be more embarrass
ing to Mr. Bryan than the support of Mr. Cleveland
and Richard Olney? He and his gang abused them
both, vituperating them in every way known to par
tisan misrepresentation in 1806. The convention that
nominated Bryan hissed Cleveland. In the last ses
sion of Congress, during the debate on the gold stan
dard bill, when Jefferson Levy and other sound money
Democrats mentioned Cleveland the Bryan crowd in
the House hissed and hooted.
As was to have been expected, Mr. Cleveland
promptly denounced the story as "an unmitigated
falsehood, a lie from beginning to end."
Again, every intelligent man knows that the Bryan
c'aim of ownership of the labor union and commercial
traveler vote is a myth. As far as the commercial
traveler claim is concerned, it is* based upon the state
ment that those men have been thrown out of employ
ment. An examination of the records of their na
tional organization and of their insurance and accident
company shows a larger membership than ever be
fore.
The next was a statement that Mr. Cleveland had
predicted a landslide for Bryan, giving as a reason that
the labor unions and the commercial travelers are for
him. Every one familiar with Mr. Cleveland recog
nized the forgery at once. The petty form of the
pretended statement was seen at once to have not a
single feature of Mr. Cleveland's well-known, clear
and robust statement.
The Bryan campaign does not rely only upon lying
about the Chinese question, but*about everything else.
Within ten days it has spawned numerous lies. One
was to the effect that at a public banquet in New
York Senator Scott of West Virginia had praised the
trusts. Upon immediate investigation it. was shown
that there had been no banquet, and that Senator
Scott had not dined in New York, except privately,
and that at that private dinner there had been no
conversation about trusts. So that lie failed and fell.
THE Republican National Committee has warned
the country against the final lying of the Bryan
campaign. Bryan's committee is reduced to the
last hope and looks for a desperate chance as the re
sult of fraud and falsehood, on the same line as the
"Morey letter" forgery of 1880. In California great
reliance is put upon a renewal of the Chinese scare.
The fact is that the policy of Chinese exclusion is
safely settled as the permanent policy of the country.
Those who represent the contrary to be the fact are
not the friends of white labor. They don't care for
it, except to assume that it is ignorant enough to
throw away its vote on a false issue. The course of
President McKinley in the existing troubles in China
makes him master of the situation involving our ex
clusion treaty with that country. Under that treaty
we have the right to regulate, exclude and forbid the
immigration of Chinese laborers in periods of ten
years. The current exclusion period terminates in
1502. At that expiration the statute will be renewed
and exclusion will prevail for another decade. But,
better than this, there is a prospect that President
McKinley. by reason of his strong attitude in the pres
ent Chinese trouble, will negotiate an amendment oi
the treaty abolishing the ten-year-period feature and
making the exclusion statute permanent, so that pe
riodical re-enactment will not be necessary, and the
law will stand as a fixture, just the same as our law
of naturalization;

KANSAS CITY JOCRXAL-The theory
of Mr. Bryan has been that all men have

UP-TO-DATE
EDITORIAL
UTTERANCE
With an enemy of that kind Roberts is hardly likely
to resort to the war tactics of Caesar's time. More
over, it is now evident the Boers are of stuff too stub
born to be tamed by harshness. Dewet is proving
himself to be one of the greatest guerrilla leaders of all
time, and in every way a worthy antagonist of the
great field marshal who upholds the empire.
"During the progress of the fight we constantly
caught glimpses of the Red.Cross flag, escorting one
or other of these gallant ladies (Mrs. Buchan and Miss
Crawfurd) to points where wounded Boers were lying.
Throughout the fight the Boers respected the conven
tions, repeatedly expressing their appreciation and
their gratitude for tha^services of these ladies. For
this courtesy Commandant Eloff was largely respon
sible, and indeed, if there was any abuse of the Red
Cross flag the blame of such disrespect cannot be
charged against the enemy, since our side, I under
stand, issued orders that the men of the firing line
were not to take notice of any white flags which the
Boers displayed. The enemy respected its conven
tions, treated the prisoners humanely, and behaved
throughout a situation almost maddening from the
strain which it must have imposed upon them, with
conspicuous gallantry, coolness and consideration."
In this connection it is worth noting that British
officers and newspaper correspondents who have re
turned to London have contradicted many of the sto
ries of Boer cruelties told during the early days of the
war. The London Chronicle, for example, quotes
this statement from J. Angus Hamilton, who was in
Mafeking during the siege:
namely, Caesar, and ruthlessly suppress the rebellion."
The Globe begs him to remember: Â¦Â¦ "The truest mercy
in the present case is to be merciless." These and
other frantic cries of London critics are not going to
help Roberts much. His troubles are not of a kind
that can be lightened by the adoption of such tactics
aj. the critics call for. "
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOYEMBER 1, 1900.
A Iocs! Democrat of many years' standing objects
to the pnemies of law. Â«oap and order which Bryan
h^Â« enlisted in his motley army. Does this Democrat
want to deprive Bryan of the last vestige of support?
The love-smitten young lady who tried to kill her
f-elf in this city a few days ago by swallowing coal
oil and then turning on the gas might have made a
success of a very unique performance by lighting 1
match.
The local Chinese who has committed six murders
just for fun seems to have developed a sense of humor
sufficiently acute to enjoy dancing on the end of a
rope. He ought to be able to appreciate both sides

Notwithstanding the promises of the Board of
Education to observe the chronological order in pro
motions, it would be very wise for teachers to keep
an eye on the board.
The Oakland Water Company has confessed that
it has not burned all of its books. It would not re
quire a very shrewd gvesser to suspect, however, that
all of the incriminating records are ashes.
William Jennings Bryan asserts with great fervor
that he seeks to win the good will of his countrymen.
He is not so eager to admit the more palpable fact
that for four years he has been translating that good
will into coin.
The aged San Jose man who obtained a wife
through a marriage agency and now is accused by her
ot disturbance, robbery, burglary and attempted mur
der oug"ht to make a good advance agent for a firm

Recent revelations in the- records leem to be con
clusive proof that Assemblyman Henry C. Dibble and
State Senator "Eddie" Wolfe have taken pains to
earn the characterization of the "tall man and the
short man" of legislative holdups.
The local Civil Service Commission, which has
been caught in a palpable fraud, evidently believes that
when a fellow is nabbed it is unprofessional to peach
on his pals. It is easy to understand now what one
of the Commissioners meant when he assured his
friends that they would get a square deal.
"The British losses were heavier than at first re
ported. An additional officer and twelve men were
killed and three officers and twenty-five men were
wounded. The Boers left twenty-four dead and nine
teen wounded on the field and twenty-six Boers were
made prisoners." The dispatch also refers to minor
affairs in which the troops of General Kitchener and
General Methuen'were engaged, and a serious incident
between Springfontein and Filipolis, Orange River
Colony, where fifty cavalrymen were ambushed and
captured by the Boers, only seven of the party escap
ing. Another dispatch from Lord Roberts says:
"Barton attacked the ubiquitous Dewet near Frcder
ickstadt. The Boers were scattered in all directions."
â¢ % Such reports make clear the fact that the pacifica
tion of the Transvaal is going to be a long and a diffi
cult task. The British are growing weary and impa
tient of the resistance made by "the ubiquitous De
wet" and some of the more influential papers of Lon
don are clamoring for the adoption of severe meas
ures. The Saturday Review advise? Roberts to take
"a lesson from one who was a greater soldier than he.
The summary sent out from London of the reports
received from Roberts giving an account of the fight-
When Kruger gave up^ the fight and betook himself
out of the field of war to a safe seclusion the British
confidently predicted the remaining Boers would soon
lay down their arms and the work of administering the
conquered province in peace would be well under way
before the close of October. The month is near the
end, hut war in the Transvaal goes on. A few days
ago the British authorities at Pretoria .with solemn
ceremonies and stately military display proclaimed the
Transvaal a part of the British empire and raised her
Majesty's standard over the capital. Even while that
ceremony was going on Devvet had resumed the
offensive, President Steyn of the Orange Free State
had set up a new capital for that republic at Fouries
bourg, and a hundred evidences were given that Kru
ger's absence had hardly been noted by his country
men.
ROBERTS' victories in South Africa were the
main cause of the Tory victory in the British
elections. Salisbury and Chamberlain are now
safe, and the former is proceeding quietly with the
work or reconstructing his Ministry. He has great
honors in store for Roberts. When the field marshal
returns home he will be made commander in chief oC
the army, and may doubtless have an earldom and a
fortune bestowed upon him; for with all her faults
Great Britain is never niggardly toward the Heroes
who uphold her flag in war. With all those honors
and rewards in store for him, however, Roberts is
not happy. He has not yet returned home and it is
not certain when he will be able to do so. He has

Justice and concord.
The Dramatic Movement.
The action of the play Is divided Into
five parts according: to thÂ© general dra
matic formula employed by Shakespeare.
The kingdom Is first shown in its state of
contradiction. A wicked queen usurps tho
place of authority for selfish ends. The
tribute due to Rome Is denied. The mar
riage of Posthumus and Imogenâ a stron?
man and a pure woman â is repealed and
the two are forced to separate. Posthu
mus. driven to a foreign land, is himself
deceived as to his wife's fidelity by an
Italian noble and :1s driven to curse all
womankind. The ethical equilibrium of
the kingdom is thus disturbed and a dra
matic process is necessary for its restora
tion. From the conditions of the play dis
closed in the. first two acts it is seen that
in order to effect .the harmony of the
kingdom the Queen and Cloten must be
destroyed and the. Klny regain his rule;.
A war is necessary to prove thÂ« domina
tion of .Caesar, and the justice: of; the
tribute.-; Imogen and Posthumus must be
united. Iachimo punished, Pisanio Justi
fied. In the third act a new evidence of
Cymbeline's injustice is revealed. Many
years before Cymbelinei had banished
from, his kingdom,- without warrant- of
Justice. . a powerful noble, Belarius. In
his flight to the wilderness this noble had
carried with him ;the King's sons, then
mere children. Among the mountains of
"Wales they live, the- primitive life of
hunters, proving by their simplicity, bra
very and independence the superiority of
a natural over an artificial culture. ThÂ«
wilderness is a refuge from a discordant
society.-- but: -does- not Itself offer the best
conditions for development. The boys are

contact with the larger world. It is ap

TO ARRIVE;
The Well-Known Vessel, in Great Peril on a Foggy
Night Off the Horn, Is Miraculously Saved.
THE Shenandoah, the largest and
finest wooden ship afloat, is once
more in command of Captain
"Jim" Murphy. The Jovial and
popular master arrived here late
Monday nlsht and took command of the
Shenandoah yesterday. The last time he
wa-s here Captain Murphy was In com
mand of the new. steel four-masted bark
Arthur Sewall, but he longed for his old
vessel and is once more In charge of her.
When Captain Murphy left the Shenan
doah to take command of the Arthur Se
wall, his son was given the command of
the former vessel. lie made one trip and
then took another vessel. A new captain
i took the Shenandoah and he made two
round trips on her, but failed to make the
ventures pay. Now Captain Murphy, who
is a big owner in the craft, has again
taken hold and dividends are once more
expected. Â¦ -.. Â¦
When Captain Murphy was last in com
mand of the Shenandoah she had a nar
row escape off the Hum. On & foggy
night she was making about ten knots an
hcur. Suddenly the fog lifted and under
the clear moonlight the lookout gave the
alarm, "land ahead.". In an instant the
ship was put in stays and then by back
ing the sails on the main and mlzzen and
tilling those on the fore, the Shenandoah
wont on the other tack and escaped de
struction. .Â¦Â¦Â¦[Â¦: :
Sailing of the Alameda.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Ala
trifrta sailed for the South Seas last- night.
She carried an unusually large cargo and
every passenger she could take. There
were 142 travelers in the cabin and many
of them had to sleep on sofas in ordpr to
get away at all. Many of the passengers
are bound for Honolulu and once the mail
boat reaches that port the crowd will be
materially diminished. .

There will be a big crowd down to see
the Tahiti mall steamer away this after
noon. Quite a: number of excursionists szo
away on the ocean liner and their rel
atives and friends are sure to be down
and pee them off. Then again It Is the
first mail steamer, that has left here for
Papeete, the "Queen City of the Pacific,"
and that lends interest to the sailing.
The Oceanic Steamship Company has a
contract with the French Government to
carry the mails between Papeete and San

CAPTAIN JAMES MURPHY AGAIN ASSUMES
COMMAND OF CLIPPER SHIP SHENANDOAH
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1900.
IMOGEN.
(Miss Ellen Terry.)
Group A â (1) Cymbellne, (2) Imo
gen, (3) Posthumus. (4) the
Queen, (5) Cloten.
Group Bâ (6) IacMiuo (also Imogen
and Posthumus).
Group Câ (7) Belarius and the two
Princes tconsidered as one ac
tion). .
solve from its own imperfections. The
problem of reconciliation now involves the
return of Belarius to his estate and of the
boys to their father. JBut before their de
parture two important events occur. Im
ogen in her flight from the court flniia
refuge in their cave and Is adopted, still
in mala disguise, into the primitive fam
ily. And Cloten, pursuing ine prinoesa
with evil Intent, enters the wo<>d ant! \a
slain by Guideriu3. The idyllic stats
serves the function ot mediation,, both
here and later, when Lucius cornea with
in Its bounds to find a page in Imogen,
but it Is not a permanent condition.
With the detth of Cloten at the begin
ning of the fourth act the movement to
ward reconciliation Is started. The queen,
fretting at Cloten's absence, lies ill it thu
palace. The battle, which occupies the
fifth act. affords the r-eans of reconciling
all the warring factors. The hunters'
world is at once absorbed when Belarius
and the boys Join the British forces in the
battle. Poison, self administered, de
stroys the queen. Posthumus repents of
his hasty action in requiring the murder
of Imogen, and Is then permitted to dis
cover his wife in the guise of Luclua'
page. Through the death of the evil mind
ed and the repentance of those who have
committed error, the kingdom .is again
established upon ethical grounds and the
play concludes in peace â concludes in tha
cor.dition.u-; with the word of "peace." The
climax and turning point of the action
occurs at the beginning of the fourth act.
A diagram will illustrate tho movement
of the separate characters.
The king suffers decline, owing to his
wife's supremacy, up to the middle of the
fourth act, when the queen 13 taken 111.
Imogen finds her first succor with Belar
ius in the third act. She Is mourned for
as dead In the fourth act, but recovering
from her swoon rises in company of Lu
cius. One line (7) may represent the
action of Belarius and the two princes,
for their destinies move together. Cloten
begins to fall when rejected by Imogen
In the second act. There is suspense In
the action of all during the fifth act, wait
ing the issue of the battle and the out
come of discovery. The lines of Pisanio,
Lucius and Cornelius are omitted from
the diagram-to avoid confusion; their out
come Is not Important to the play, though
the presence of Lucius Is needed to ex
plain the movement of the fifth act.
Comments.
1. "Cjrmbeline." is classed amongr the>
tragedies, but In view of the absence or
a genuine heroic character and from the
fact of the general reconciliation at the
end of the play, it is more properly
termed a comedy. The suffering: of the
characters leads not to death, but to re
pentance and safety.
2. The play is highly composite and its
threads of interest are many and intri
cate. The problem of the play was to
unite elements so diverse- as the Briton,
the Roman and tho Italian (a Frenchman.
a Dutchman and a Spaniard also have
place), to bring together an ancient his
torical event from Hollnahed (the conflict
between Caesar and Cymbeline) and a
modern romantic Incident from Boccassio
(the wager between Iachlmo and Post
humus). then to invent the story of tho
stolen princes and their flight to a wil
derness (probably an adaptation from
folklore), and further to provide for unity
through the mediation of a single char

whole scene Is spectacular, and not essen
tial to the development of the action The
ghosts mumble an inferior dotrtrere! hard
ly consonant with the dignity of their rev
elation The Introduction of a pÂ£!ph" cy
that only confuses and retards thÂ« movÂ»
ment Is unjustifiable at that stage of tho
process. The conversation between
Posthumus and the jailers is irrelevant

?hf a , V Â« PUrp Â°K e Â» and the function o?
the vision may be to emphasize tho ac
ceptance by deity of the act of repent

to be explained as an interpolation.
4 The Importance of Imogen In the play
will bÂ« more clearly understood If a rec
ord Is made of her conflicts and media
tions. A father denies her the right of
choice In the supreme personal Incident
of love. A stepmother antagonizes her at
every point and makes attempt upon her
life. A clownish noble pursues her with
sensual Intention. An Italian, skillful in
love intrigues, tempts her virtue. A hus
band comes to doubt and curse her and to
demand her life in revenge. She la not
certain of the pood faith of Pisanlo. Sh<Â»
Is forced to live In disguise with strangers
and to become a servant of an alien sol
dier. Through all these conflicts she
maintains her Integrity and thus becomes
the central flirure of the spiritual system
of the play. From her as a center pro
ceed the lines of repentance and restora
tion to all the members of the kingdom.
It is true that the play comprehends mnre
than her single heroisms and mediations
nevertheless she Is practically the sum
of its contradictions and the single agent
of resolution.
5. Pisanio, as a mediatorial agent, is
second only to Imogen. It is not given to
him to have a fate^ â fates In Shakespeare
are reserved for the noble torn â hut he
is In reality the only perfect character in
the play, always in his Judgments
and Just in his actions. When pÂ»rplpxed
he appeals to the '"heavens" and his faith
is never rendered vain. As a servant ha
comes into the service of all the main
characters of the play and mediates
among them. Tet In the Shakesperean
order ne is worthy of neither rewards nor
punishments. It required another age to
discover the value- of Pisanloa.
OSCAR L. TRK3GS.
University of Chicago.
The play is named after Oymbellne. a
King of Britain at the period of the Ro
man conquest. In whose court and king
dom the chief scenes are laid. The action
depends upon the intrigues of Cymbe
llne's Queen to place herself and Cloten.
a eon by a former husband, upon the
throne. . The King is old and easily con
trolled by tho woman, whose strength of
character Is greater than hi9 own. At
her instigation he banishes Posthumus,
the accepted suitor of the hand o' Imo
gen, the King's daughter by a former wife
and the heir to his throne, and encourages
the suit of Cloten, which Is rejected by
Imogen with scorn and insult. The Inter
est of the play now centers In Imogen â
will she remain faithful to her banished
lord? Her fidelity is attacked on the one
hand by the King and Queen, who demand
her acceptance of Cloten, and on the other
hand by Posthumus himself, who lays a
wager respecting her fidelity with a vil
lainous Italian, Iachlmo. Imogen dis
misses Cloten and repulses Iachlmo, but
her trial is not yet passed. The vlllainy
of Iacbimo provides means of convincing
Posthumus of his wife's infidelity, and her

PROCTOR TELEGRAPHS
FROM NEW YORK OITY
C. L. Paige of This City Receives a
Message From the Miss
ing Man.
George C. Proctor, who has been missed
from the Palace Hotel for several days,
has been heard from. He is in New York
City, where he went hurriedly in the in
terests of the Old Colony Mining Com
pany, of which he is president. Yester
day C. L. Paige, also a stockholder in
the company, who has offices In the Par
rott building, received a telegram from
Proctor stating that he was in New Tork
and that he would return to San Fran
cisco shortly.
The stock of the Old Colony . Mining
Company is largely subscribed to by
Eastern capitalists, and Paige stated yes
terday that Proctor Is in the habit of
making flying trips to New York and thus
accounts for his friend's mysterious dis
appearance. Proctor left this city last
Thursday or Friday and nothing was
heard of him until yesterday, when the
telegram was received. The office of the
mining company of which Proctor is pres
ident is*Â«hared with the Calustro Minine
Company. When Proctor so mysteriously
disappeared Palgo took charge of his af
fairs here.
Paige stated yesterday to a reporter that
he was sorry that Proctor's hurried de
parture had received such prominence In
the press, but admitted that it was a
careless oversight on his friend's part not
to have settled his hotel bill. He called
atthe Palace HoteJ yesterday and aettled

send to Congress a solid Republican delegation
of seven.
Mr. Fprd then continued to analyze the
Congressional contests. He spoke of the
men who had already been to Congress
and who wished to go again, and in that
connection he instanced the case of tho
State, of Maine in Congress. Maine, he
said, had but four Representatives when
he was in Washington, and California had
seven, but Maine had an influence in Con
gress second to none. The reason, he
Bald, was because Maine chose men of
sterling quality and returned them year
after year until them became patriarchs
among their Congressional fellows. One
was Speaker of the House; another was
chairman of the Ways and Means Com
mittee; a third was chairman of the Com
mittee on Naval Affairs, and the fourth
was chairman of the Committee on Public
Buildings. So should It be with Califor
nia. "We should, he declared, return good
men again and again until they became
powers In Washington, and can care for
the, interests of their State Intelligently
and fairly.
I have thought for a long time to find a
reason for the course of the Democrats and I
have come to believe that they seek a. change
of officers. And to secure this they have run
the gamut of issues from the money question
and protection and free trade to the trusts,
and then, all these falling, they cry out "Im
perialism." That, too. must fall. Imperialism
as defined by Mr. Bryan Is a pure and flitting
myth, thÂ« final and despairing cry of impending
defeat. It would be ridiculous did It not smack
of treason. Its Iteration and reiteration in this
country Is echoed bj- the Filipinos' guns 6000
miles away. Is Bryan giving aid and/Consola
tion to the Filipinos? I can only refer you to
the attitude of Bryan to the insurgents. He
stands a self-confessed supporter of Agulnaldo
In his opposition to this country.

It is the party of broken promises, of unful
filled pledges, of dlsproven prophecies, of ruin
and disaster. Its efforts have been futile, its
policies have produced misfortune and Its prin
ciples are inimical to the best -interests of la
bor. The Republican party offers you Its rec
ord of achievement. Its wide experience In gov
ernment, its beneficent commercial and Indus
trial programme, its transcendent ability for
the conduct of public affairs, and Its unques
tioned honesty and patriotism.
Tirey L.. Ford, Attorney General of Cali
fornia, was then Introduced. He wound
up the evening In a ringing speech in
which he said:
The glory of a nation is In Its young men.
The glory of the Republican party is Its high
ideals and purposes that keep with- it the
young men. The young men have ever been
the people's bulwark, the nation's pride, and
now in our country's crisis it is to the youns
men we turn to see to it that at the opening
of the new century our country Is facing
toward the dawn. It has been said . that the
nation owes much to Kan Francisco; and I say
San Francisco owes much to the nation. And
it is fitting that California's sons should lead
in the victory that means so much to San
Francisco and our own State. The young
man Is abroad in the State to-day, and he is
leading a movement that will find expression
in a tremendous vote that, south of the Te
hachlpi alone, will give us a majority of not
less than 5000. And In the Interior there are
those, who will help to raise this and help Cal
ifornia give a bigger majority to the head
of the ticket than it haa ever before given. I
think so far as the head of the ticket is con
cerned, it is all over but the shouting â and I
think the First Voters' Club will take care of
that.
But there Is another thing. California Bhould
ent and steadfast friend of free American labor
from the very moment of its birth. It is to
day the advocate of the most enlightened tariff
and of the most beneficial Industrial policy
that our nation has ever known. The history
of the last quarter century has proved that in
the maintenance of the Republican party In
power and in the continuance of the principles
for which it stands Is wrapped the fortunes
and destinies of this republic and the prosper
ity of the people.
Xo Issue can be of more importance than the
question of how the true Interests of labor
may best be served and how prosperity may
best be established and secured. Good business
makes cood Government. Why Is it that the
I'nlted Slates Is so far advanced beyond all
other countries in the condition of Its people?
Because, as a whole, work has been plenty,
wages good and the dignity of labor main
tained. What a difference between the Demo
cratlo free-trade administration of 1893-97 and
the present Republican protective-tariff ad
ministration. In 1S96, the last year of Demo
cratic power and of the free-trade Wilson bill,
the volume of money in circulation was 121 15
per capita. This has Increased every year since
Jjien, until to-dav the aggregate volume of
money Is $500,0CO,000 greater than it was in
When conelderlpg this subject it Is well to re
fer to the memorable campaign of 1S36.
It was the closing year of a Democratic ad
ministration under Grover Cleveland. Indus
tries were paralyzed. Factories were -closed
and labor was struggling against starvation.
The membra of the great army of the unem
ployed were crowding the streets clamoring for
admittance to the publlo soup houses. What
remedies' did our Democratic brethren offer?
In the Chicago convention the silver ring of
their party gained control and they offered no
other relief save the free and unlimited coin
age of Fllver at 16 to 1.
The Republican party pledged itself to restore
confidence and to provide tariff and money
legislation. Following the election of McKin
ley, as if by magic, the big republic awakened.
Confidence was restored. Furnaces were again
lighted, business was resumed, labor was em
ployed and the soup houses were closed. Loyal
tlonal prosperity of my native State and its ad
vancement to its proper position among this
great union of States, and because the suc
cess of that same party means opportunity in
the fullest sense of the word to young Cali
fornians.
Charles L.. Neumiller then spoke on
"Republican Pledges." He said:
SOME OF THOSE WHO AT THE RALLY OF YOUNG REPUBLICANS LAST
NIGHT DISpUSSED THE PRINCIPLES OF THE PARTY AND THE ISSUES
OF THE CAMPAIGN.
rHERE was as bright an aggrega
tion of young: men on the stage of
Odd Fellows' Hall Jast even
ing 1 * as could well - be got -to- :
gether, and right lustily did they
demolish the Bryan arguments. They
were the officers of the First Voters' Mc-
Kinley and Roosevelt Club and the speak
ers of the evening. Gathered to hear their
speeches was more than a hall full, and
the enthusiasm aroused by the speakers
was supplemented by the Rough Riders'
Quartet and a full brass band.
The proceedings were opened by the
"Rough Riders," who sang campaign
songs until the presiding officer of the
evening:. J. M. Mannon, president of the
First Voters, came forward to introduce
the speakers. In opening the evening"s
programme he made a few remarks In
which he spoke of the place of the young
man in peace and in war. It was- the
young man, he said, who is the hope of
the country in peace and it is the young
man upon whom the country rested in
time of war. It was so during the war of
the rebellion and It was eo during the
glorious victory Just won under a Repub
lican administration: and further, he said,
it ii< the young men who will govern the
territory newiy acquired. He spoke of
the reason's lor the organization of the
First Voters' Club, and said he took
pleasure in introducing the lirst speaker
of the evening. Carey Van Fleet. Mr.
Van Fleet was greeted with much ap
plause. He spoke as follows:
Ye; a few days and Mr. Bryan's pipe dream
wlJl be over. He will be rudely awakened and
then hÂ« will flnd that all these specter ehapes

The chairman then Introduced Hartley
F. Peart, who spoke on "California and
Expansion." He eaid:
ThÂ» welfare of this great nation depends upon
a eound foreign policy, a sound financial policy
and the re-election of William McKinley. And
the future of our State lies in that party which
t-tands for expansionâ territorial, industrial and
commercial.
There are people in the East who still think
of i.ur State as part of the wild and woolly
West. But to others California brings to mind

Vour years ago it is estimated that over 2,000,000
American citizens tramped the length and

work was to bÂ« had. To-day not only is there
work in abundance, but wages are higher tnan
ever before In the course of our history.
Are the American people going to refuse their
Indorsement ?â¢ the Republican party because
It has accomplished these great results? Are
the people going to defeat the policies and the
principles which have been responsible for this

Are the people going to give their votes to the

It is generally conceded bv leading
Democrats that Bryan Is already beaten,
hence It Is argued that the Mayor's in
dorsement of the national ticket ought
not to provoke an uproar of indignation,
but the case is different with the local
nominees, as some of them hope to win
out. Bert Schlesinger, for example, nom

said to-day that there was no Intention
of operating the Kansas City Southern in
connection with any of the Southwestern

"It will be conducted strictly on Its

have been disposed to conduct It In rather
a reckless manner and to make it profit
able as a rate-slasher In Southwestern

to maintain rates by means of the Kan

SIAYFIELD. Oct. 31.â A rousing Repub
lican rally was held here to-night under
the auspices of the Mayne'.d and Stanford
University clubs. Professor Tracy, presi
dent of the local club, called the meeting
to order and Introduced R. P. Cross of
Stanford University, who spoke on the
Philippine question.
Hon. E. F. Loud was then Introduced
and he made a rousing address. He said
that the duty of voters was clearer at this
election than ever before. The Demo
cratic party of Bryan is as much worso
than the party of Cleveland as It wer*
possible for man to conceive. Free trade,
he said, wa? good in theory, but was Im
practicable. Statistics showed that the
three and a half years, of McKinley's ad
ministration had been the most prosper
ous by far of any period in the history of
the country. The people had far more
sense than Bryan pave them credit for.
as would be shown. on election day. He
continued:
The Congressional Record shows that tha
Democrats themselves forced the late war us<>n
the country. Urjan declared at first he would
haul down the American flag in the Philip
pines. He> has since been silent on that point.
Perhaps he remembers the fate of "Para
mount" Blount. who hauled down the flag in
Hawaii, ami ia never beard oj now on that
account. Br>an is helping to keep alive the
rebellion in the Philippines by hts encourage
ment and mcral support. The Idea ot compar
ing Agulnaldo with Washington is ridiculous.
E. Myron Wolf was then introduce'!
and made a rapid and forceful speech.
As a graduate from the University of
California he said he wished to aid the
Stanford University amendment and thai
grand woman who had done and was do
ing so much for California.
"See to It." said he, "that Congress 13

Vern Tracy and W. A. Morris of Stan

Stanford amendment. The necessity of
allowing the university to receive prop

CHICAGO. Oct. 31.-The culmination of
the October pork corner, controlled by Sir
Thomas Lipton, came to-day when pork
for delivery this month advanced $3, ris
ing on less tnan a dozen trades from $17.
yesterday's closing price, to $20 at the
close to-day.
The buying was by shorts, who had held
off until the last moment. It was said that
Sir Thomas could have made the price
$100 as well as $20, but he declared he had
no intention of "squeezing" anybody. That
the October deal did not furnish greater
excitement to-day was due, It is sajd. to
the fact that many shorts, threatened
with being swept oft the board, were pre
viously allowed toiflx up their deals with
Lipton : privately.
As a result of his deal here Lipton Is
believed to have made $350,000. . There were
only 35,000 barrels of pork that could be
delivered and the Englishman owned them
all, as well as twice that number bought
from those who did not have a barrel to
deliver when the time came. When the
price reached $16 some time ago the ma
jority of . shorts thought it time to buy
some of the pork they had contracted to
deliver at approximately $11 per barrel
during October. Numerous private settle
ments are said to have been made, so that
while ; the bear speculators in pork have
received some painful financial injuries the
Injuries have not been mortal. A prelim
inary settlement; of 1000 barrels .was made
near the end of , the session, Upton's rep
resentative allowing a- belated short to
take that amount at $1S per barrel, assur
ing the buyer 'that at: the close the price
would be $20. â¢ That he knew whereof . he
spoke was made plain to everybody later,
for - as the closing bell sounded Samuel
Wolf was shouting bids of $>0.

PLYMOUTH. Ind., Oct. 31.â Adlai E.
Stevenson, Democratic candidate for Vlca
President, addressed a large meeting here
this afternoon. He spoke for two hours,
dealing mainly with the trusts. Mr.
Stevenson was followed by E. W. Barker
of Oregon in a brief address.

This evening the greatest political rally
of the season was held In the pavilion.
The spacious hall was crowded to Its ut
most capacity. Fully 3000 persons heard
Governor Gage speak. The chairman of
the meeting was Thomas H. Selvage, can
didate for State Senator.
EUREKA, Oct. 31.â A steady downpour
of rain interfered somewhat with the pro
gramme arranged for the reception of
Governor Gage, but did not dampen the
ardor of the Humboldt Republicans. They
came from all parts of the county on ex
cursion trains to meet the Governor. The
steamship Pomona, carrying Governor
Gage, crossed In at 8 o'clock this morning
and steamed slowly up the bay. She was
met by the stÂ«amer Antelope, on which
was a delegation of leading citizens, ac
companied by the Eureka band. Â¦ Both
vessels were gayly decorated with stream
ers and bunting. At the wharf a dense
crowd awaited the landing of the steamer
and repeatedly cheered Governor Gage. A
committee consisting of Common Council
Chairman Bull and Secretary Gregor of
the County Central Committee, Senator
Gillette, J. M. Vance and J. W. Hender
son formally welcomed the visitors. In
the afternoon a reception was held in the
parlors of the Vance Hotel.

clapped a hand over my watch and hur
ried into the cafe. Abe came along more
leisurely and saw the two bosses Join their
two friends. Buckley and O'Connell. If
any one imagines there was net something
doing in the vicinity of the SL George
stables that day he shows a confidence in
Kelly and Rainey that the men who know
them best do .not possess.
"As we went on Into Norman's Ruef
said, 'Well, did you ever see a prettier
bunch than that?' I replied: 'It is Just
what was to be expected. Kelly never
could keep anything from Rainey, any
way.' Lucius Solomons came In a few
moments later, and when we told him
what we had seen he said, "That is what
we have to expect from men like Kelly.' "
J. II. Nelson, the Republican nominee
whom Kelly and his henchman Buckley
are willing and anxious to defeat, is a
capable man. with a good record. The
fact that Kelly and Rainey are leagued
to defeat him ought to cause self-respect
ing Republicans and Democrats to rally
to his support, and tho indications are
strong that {hey will do so and will re
buko tbe meddling bosses by the defeat
of O'Connell, who Is by no means an Inno

MARTIN KEL.LT, barroom boss,
convention orator and protege
of Herrin. has joined . forces
with Sam Rainey. his proto
type of the Democratic end of
disreputable politics, to defeat the Repub
lican candidate for State Senator in the
Twenty-fifth Senatorial District. Kelly's
henchmen In that district are knlilng J.
H. Nelson, the regular Republican nomi
nee, and exerting every effort to elect J.
J. O'Connell, Rainey's candidate origin
ally and now the Ralney-Kelly-Herrln
candidate.
This bit of characteristic political trea
son on Kelly's part has been pretty well
understood for some time among Nelson's
friends In his district. Monday an inci
dent occurred which illustrates the close
relations existing in this campaign be
tween the bloated bosses of the opposing
parties. While the leaders are thundering
denunciations and straining every nerve
to win on the great national issues In
volved these two unspeakables compla
cently plot together to control local pa-
tronage, each regardless of the effect on
his party's interests in general. Alfred
Bouvier saw the evidence of Kelly's trea
son and for a time called back his
thoughts from grand opera heights and
gloated over the spectacle before him.
"Abe Ruef and I were on our way to
Norman's for lunch Monday a little after
1 o'clock." Mr. Bouvier said last night.
"As we turned up Bush street from
Kearny I was holding forth on things
theatrical and operatic, when Ruef sud
denly Interrupted me with, 'In the name
of all that's holy, look at that!' And he
pointed to the opposite corner, and there
stood 'Eddie' Buckley and 'Jack' O'Connell.
Buckley 13 a member of the Republican
State Central Committee and ought to be
working for the election of Nelson. But
Ruef knew Buckley was- plotting secretly
to defeat Nelson, and here he was caught
in the very company of Nelson's opponent
and In an attitude of confidential relations
that was very apparent.
"Ruef had not stopped his ejaculations
when a greater wonder met our. gaze.
Standing- just Inside the St. George sta
bles, near the office door, were Sam
Ralney and Martin Kelly himself. If that
picture were gilded and put in a frame it
would make the fortune of any saloon in

The Board of Education made six as
signments yesterday of teachers from the
substitute list to regular positions in the
department, and. as was foretold in last
Sunday's. Call, the name of Mrs. Irene D.
Reeves was not among the lucky ones,
though following the chronological order
she should have been selected. Mrs.
Reeves has incurred the wrath of the
board because ehe declined to withdraw
her suit, now pending In the Superior
Court, in which she seeks to-be restored
to her high school status from which she
was recently removed.
Chairman Mark takes exception to the
accusation made in this paper that the
board had sought to coerce Mrs. Reeves
Into withdrawing her suit under penalty
of not receiving an appointment if she
did not do so. Mark, however, himself
proved the truth of the accusation yes
terday when ho repeated his former dec
laration.
"As soon as Mrs. Reeves withdraws her
suit she will get an assignment," said
Mark. "We will not appoint her. how
ever, until her standing In the depart
ment has been determined by the court."
With the exception of Mrs. Reeves the
priority of service rule governed in the
six assignments, which were as follows:
Mrs. K. Turney to the Chinese Primary
Mrs/'N. T. Foley to ' the* Bernal -Primary
SC Mrs > .' H. B. Steele to the Hearst Grammar
School.
Miss J. Frank to the James Lick Grammar
during the leave of Miss A. D. Mlle>\
M!bs I* O'Connell to the Pacific Heights
Grammar during the leave of Miss C. Thomp-
MI.18 C. Carroll to the John Swett Grammar
Behool.
Miss M. A. Rollins was transferred from tha
Bernal to the Buena Vista School (new class).
The board will have some trouble In ex
plaining its appointment of Mrs. H. B.
Steele to the Hearst Grammar School.
Mrs. Steele was a special teacher of his
tory, having been appointed as such on
February 27 1805. Her position was abol
ished In August. 1900, and she was elected
Into the department as a regular teacher
In the same menth, which fact was re
cently published In The Call. It is con
tended that the chronological order of
Mrs Steele'a appointment dates from her j
election as a regular teacher, and not
from her appointment as a special
teacher. .
Misa M. A. Harrlgan, who was elected
into the department in 1871, also failed of
assignment. She was placed on the sub
stitute list at her own request. The rea
son given is that Miss Harrigan does not
desire to accept her assignment to a
grammar grade In the James Lick School, i
i A resolution suspending Section 52 of the
rules was repealed, which will have the
effect of restoring the substitute list to
the original number of fifteen teachers.
A communication was received from
: Mayor Phelan which contains a petition
; that the Ell Hochstadter bequest, which
now amounts to $1500, be used for the
benefit of the Home for Aged and Infirm
Colored People, a duly Incorporated char
itable organization. The bequest was
made by Hochstadter to be used by the
Board of Education in distributing prizes
to colored children In this city in com
petition against each other in scholastic
ability. â¢ The board is of the opinion that
the money cannot be used for the latter
purpose, as in some classes there Is but
one colored child, which would prevent
any competition. The matter was taken
under, advisement.
Â¦ Superintendent Webster entered a formal
protest against the fixing of the salaries
of ; the i principals cf the Falrmount and
Burnett; schools at $135. Webster stated
that he 'had declared the two schools to
be grammar schools, and as such the prin
cipals ' were entitled to $175 ' each. The
board declined to accept the grammar
rating of, the Superintendent . on the
ground that th^ attendance did not reach
250. .In the face of this course Webster
calls attention to the fact that the Wash-

but his motion was lost. His was the
only vote registered asalnst Miss

GRAND JURY REPORT ON OFFICIAL
MISCONDUCT OF EDWARD I. WOLFE
THE McNab-^fcelan Democratic or
ganization is making use nf the de
partment of patronage of the city
Fnvernment la its flpht to secure
the election of Thomas E. Curran.
the "Phelan organization" candidate for
?ta:e Senator in the Nineteenth Sen
atorial District. Richard Welch, the
Republican nominee. Is a strong: candi
date, and the Democratic leaders are not
stepping at fair meens to accomplish his
defeat and the election of a man who will
deliver Phelan a vote for United States
Senator.
John H. Grady, the reformer, a member
cf Mayor Phelan's Fire Commission, and
who along with the Mayor has made
greatest pretensions of a determination to
keep politics out cf the Fire Department,
has been making an active personal can
vass for Curran. He has been bitter In
his opposition to Welch and has gene so
far as to shower personal abuse upon
friends of the Republican candidate.
Grady and Curran have been making
th6 rounds of the district together, and.
they have not failed to visit every engine
house in the district. While open threats
have not been made, the firemen in those
engine-houses understand perfectly well
that their influence must be used for Cur
ran. Thar.ks to the secret ballot, their
own votes cannot be controlled by the
Democratic organization. Dick Welch
has many i\arna friends among" the fire
men, who will cast their votes for him.
though they are denied the right to ex
r-re?s tl.*ir preference, while Curran men
may do eo with impunity.
David Aheti, a driver fnr the Fire
Patrol, whese position is held only with
ihe approval of the Fir* Commissioners,
is the most active man In the district in
favor of Curran"6 candidacy. Recently he
was given a two weeks' vacation, at an
opportune time, and spent it in making
fa personal canvass in Curran's interests.
In other departments employes are
working in season and out. for Curran.
without any rebuke from the reformers
who insisted that the administration of
jublic offices should be divorced from
politics. i
John Fnpplanl, an outside deputy em
rloyed tinder the Board of Public Works,
lias been making hay diligently by work
ing -for Curran while driving about on
business of the city connected with sewer
work.
Foppiani is & personal friend of Welch,
e.r.n paid to him recently:
"I am sorry to be going against you,
Dick. But you know how It Is with me.
A man has to look out for his living."
Dan Rifirdan, formerly a policeman and
xiow a deputy under the Board of Health,
is likewise using the city's time to talk
lor Curran'p candidacy.
one of thÂ«Â» most culpable attempt? to
n?f the public patronage to aid Curran
and indirectly Prelan was that of a thir.lv
veiled effort to win the support of Patrick
Flaherty. Flaherty is an energetic young
Democrat, who is well known a:id popular
in both Assembly d'str'cts of the Xine- :
te^nth Senatorial District. He is a warm
pers<">nr>.| friend of Richard Welch and has
not hesitated to use his Influence in his
friend'* behalf. Shortly after Curran's
nomination Curran hunted Flaherty up
*nd asked him about a bit of patronage
that had been promised Flaherty, namely,
a team in the street department at M M
per day. Curran made an appointment
v.Uh Flaherty for a few days later, and
on that occasion took him to "Butler"
Fay at the Mayor'* office. Fay told Flah
? rty that they would f.x It all right and
for him t j send his team to the corpora
tion yard and everything would be ar
iene<vi Curran raid he was afraid the boys
In Flaherty's end of the district had been
neglected a little. Flaherty said that un
der the circumstances he did not care to
Fend the team, but Fay was solicitous and
Flaherty finally consented to give his de
cision the next day. Flaherty went to the
Mayer's office the next day and told Fay
that he had decided to refuse the offer.
"While nothing was said about support-
Ing Curran," Flaherty said last night. "I
t;nder?tood perfectly well that If I accept
ed the good offices of Fay and Curran my
support of the latter would be expected.
ThÂ«>y had no office or patronage In their
pift that would induce me to throw down
my old friend. Dick Welch, and 1 refused
to* send a team to the corporation yard."
It !s known that several policemen with
r'--s=ld*noe;5 In th*> Nineteenth Senatorial
District are working tooth and nail for
Curran. though publicity ?iven to the fact
Â¦would probably rause them to be "broke"

own non-partisan position.

CHICAGO, Oct. 31. â Throughout the session
In the wheat pit speculative eyes were glued
on the Argentine advices. Numerous reports
confirmatory of previous ones were received,
placing the damage to the Argentine crop at
from 40 to SO per cent. An advance of Hid in
Liverpool was also credited to the stories sent
to the other side of the water. In many cases
there was an inclination to consider the dam
age reports exaggerated. December opened %0
Me higher at 74Uc and on a good g'eneral de
mand, shorts leading, advanced sharply to 74Tic
At this point profit-taking caused a reaction to
74V4Â®"4%c, but as the offerings were readily ab
sorbed a further rally ensued. December closed
lHfÂ«lV*c higher at 74%Â®74%c.
Corn was quiet but firm. Influenced by wet
weather in the U'eat and the wheat strength.
December closed Me ud at 35c.
Oats were quiet and steady. December closed
%C higher at 22c. .
The trade In provisions was light and the
feeling was easier on liberal hog receipts and
lower prices at the yards. October pork fur
nished the only incident. Till near the close
there were only two trades in this cornered
product. They were at $17, yesterday's close.
Later, however, sales were made at J18 and at
J20, the close being at the latter figure. January
pork closed 5c down, lard 6c lower and ribs 5c
depressed.

The markets here were dull and inactive to
day; -partly under the influence of the higher
ir*oney rates and partly in anticipation of the
holiday to-morrow. : The American department
alone showed animation, but here the dealings
nerely followed the New York lead, hesitat
ing at times, but closing at practically the
best. The bullish sentiment on Southern Pa
ciflc In New York was apparently shared here,
as good buying of these shares was reported
to-day. There was some talk of an advance
of the bank rate to-morrow, but such action la
Improbable, especially as French and German
exchange Is moving favorably to London.

Secretary M. J. "White of the California
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children: Officer H. McMurray, who la
attached to the society, and Robert D.
MaJne. were booked at the City Prison
yesterday morning on the charge of kid
naping. They are accused by Mr3.
George Vincent of 46% Tehama street with
forcibly taking from her Tuesday after
noon her four children. Cora, Ida, Hazel
and Maude Maine, while they were legal
ly in her custody. The three men were
released on $10 cash ball each, accepted
by Judge Cabanis3.
The woman was divorced from Maine In
Los Angeles In April. 1S78. being awarded
the custody of the four children. She al
leges that Maine returned from Arizona
about tea days ago and meeting her on
the street threatened to have her heart's
blood if she did not live with him again.
She could not cio so even If she were will
ing, she told him. as she was married to
George Vincent, a Portuguese, In Oak
land, a week ago. Tuesday afternoon
Maine, accompanied by Secretary White
and Officer McMurray. called at her house
and demanded possession of her four chil
dren. She asked if they were officers, but
they gave her no satisfaction, she says,
and McMurray called her and her
daughter Cora, 12 yearn of age, a vile
name, following It up by striking them
both on the face, the woman declare*.
Then the three men took away the chil
dren.
Secretary White says that hl3 society
took hold of the case at the request of
Maine, who was excellently recommended
"I think under the circumstances," he
added, "and with the evidence of the
woman's unfltness to take care of the
children, which la in our possession, we
were justified In doing what we did. Mc-
Murray did not Insult the woman as she
claims, and said nothing that wa.* not In
my opinion proper. Purcell Rowe. at
torney for the sochty. advised us that
we had the authority to take possession
of the children and we acted on that ad
vice. Judge CofTey time and again has
upheld actions of the kind in similar cir
cumstances."
Officer McMurray also denied that hte
conduct toward Mrs. Vincent was im
proper. He admitted, however, that the
proper course would have been to have
procured a warrant for the woman's ar
rest for not being a fit custodian for the
children. Maine corroborated McMurray
and said that he ha'.! been giving th
woman money to support the children and
had even paid up the arrears for their
maintenance in the Beulah Home.
Captain Seymour sent for Mrs. Vincent
yesterday and after hearing her state
ment said: "White and McMurray had no
right to enter the woman's house without
warrant and take away her children. She
was the legal custodian of the little ones
according to the decree In the divorce
case, and If she was considered an unfit
person to have their custody there was a
legal remedy to> get them away from her.
The woman has been working hard in
canneries to support her children, as her
hands will show, and Is apparently deeplv
attached to them. If I were Chief of Po
lice I would not alllow an officer to have
anything to do with these societies."
Chief Sullivan sent for Officer McMur
ray. who told him that the woman had
been under surveillance for over a year,
and that If what was said about her
were true, she was utterly unfit to have
the custody of the children. He denied
using an offensive name to the woman or
the girl, but checked the latter for her
Intemperate language. The chief will
probably await the outcome of the cas*Â»
before takine any action. McMurray has
held the position he now occupies for a
number of years and no charge has been
brought against him. Action has been
commenced In the Superior Court for thÂ©
appointment of a proper guardian for the
children. Â¦

ARE ACCUSED
OF KIDNAPING
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
â¢ HIS Broadway. Oct 3L
Every scrap of old junk, disused and
never utilized property of the Contra
Costa Water Company Is being dragged
into the evidence at the rates trial to
pile up what will unquestionably be an
enormous total .valuation upon its plant.
The water company's lawyers have
gone into the minutest details of con
struction, even to the number of teams
and the men employed upon every Inch
of ground while they have dug up from
the corporation's records, not unburned,
all sorts of property, movable and im
movable, upon which they propose to
place .their estimates of value.
Attorney Hayne, for the city, has
followed his antagonists so closely that
he has a complete record of everything
the corporation has no far claimed, tha
theory being that he proposes to show in
the course of the trial the uselessness of
much of the property the company owns.
â¢ The cross-examination of Engineer
Hewson was concluded to-day. Out of It
all was brought one more record which
has not been reduced to ashes. It is a
complete map of the Contra Costa Water
Company's watershed at San Leandro
LÂ«ake. The reason It. is still In existence
was shown by Hewson, who said he had
made it for the private use of former
President Henry Pierce. The map was
delivered to Pierce since the cremation
of the corporation's books.
This afternoon Attorney McGutcheon
thought he saw a big opening in Haynes'
line and like a football back bucking the
center the water company's lawyer pro
posed to hurl Into evidence all of the com
pany's records of Its pipe line holdings.
McCutcheon had the documents, but he
had not fairly started to smash Into the
record before Hayne was at him. And
when Hayne quotes law he does it in such
a way that a court Is l>ound to nearken.
"There Is no rule of evidence in exis
tence by which those books can go In
now." declared the attorney emphatically,
and the court was compelled to accept
that view. ,Â¦
As soon as that was settled 'Engineer
Hewson was withdrawn and Octave Le
nleux who had been foreman of construc
tion at the San Leandro dam for several
years during the early work on the res
ervoir, was put on the rack. Foreman
Lenleux started to tell what- he knew
about the building, of the dam and the
dreary round of sluicing, puddle nits,
tamping and excavating was renewed.
The engineer experts all looked wise and
took copious notes. Finally McCutcheon
looked at the clock and said he would like
to catch the train for San Francisco and
the court accommodatingly adjourned
until to-morrow.
All Sorts of Odds and Ends
Are Dragged Into the
Water Case.

DISCHARGES HOSPITAL
FUND RECEIVERS
Part of Fund Not Yet Dis
tributed.
Must Pay Into Court Begistry That
ST. PAUL. Minn.. Oct. 31.â Judge San
borri made an order {o-day for the dis
charge of the receivers of the Union Paci
fic Railway Company as receivers of the
hospital fund upon their paying into the
registry of the court the remainder of
that fund which has not been distributed
and placing their report on file for the
time prescribed by the rules of the court.
The amount of money for distributfon to
those who contributed to the hospital fund
of the railway was $64,292 30. The amount
of claims allowed was $259,749. The num
ber of allowed claims was 12,431.
Allowed claims to the amount of $5550 36
have not been presented to the receivers
for payment, and that amount of money
was ordered by the Judge to be deposited
In the registry of the court, to be paid to
the claimants as they appear by the clerk
of the court at Omaha. No fees or allow
ances were asked by the receivers, their
counsel or the special paymaster for the
services of administering and distributing
this fund and none was allowed, but the
entire fund was distributed to the con
tributors after deducting the actual neces
sary expenses, hire of clerks and printing.
No objection was made to the report of
the receivers and they were commended
by the court. About 100 odd claims have
not been presented.
LEAPS TO HIS DEATH
WHEN NOT IN DANGER
Fireman George W. Hand of the
Oregon Express Loses His
SACRAMENTO. Oct. 31.â George W.
Hand, a fireman on the Oregon express,
lost his life at an early hour this morn-
Ins at Proberta. Tehama County. Hand
was on the southbound express. A freight
train had gone upon the siding at Pro
berta to allow the express to pass. In go
ing upon the switch the freight train
pushed several cars ahead of it. The cars
were pushed along: too far, as they pro
jected upon the main track, and as tRe
express train came along it struck the
corner of the first car.
Hand felt the Jar. and evidently believ
ing: that a serious accident was about to
occur, he Jumped from the cab of his en
grine. The train was stopped and the
trainmen went back to look for Hand.
He was so seriously hurt by the fall that
he died within a short time after the acct
dent.

KESn-ICK. Oct. SI.â The strike at Iron
Mountain was declared off this morning
by the miners. It failed because of the
lack of organization. The men are now
willing to return to work at the old wage
scale and hours. The company, however.
does not seem to be anxious about re
suming work Immediately. The strike has
in no wise affected the operation of the
smelter at this. place.
The miners are bitter against Mine
Superintendent Selkirk, intimating: that
he was* mainly repponplble for the strike.
The strikers are leaving the camp rapid
ly, departing in gangs of five, ten, fifteen
and twenty.

Because Philip Klernan, H. J: Waters
and Chris Thorpe were afraid they would
be detained in a jury room all-night, they
voted guilty upon a verdict rendered
against William Day, accused of a hein
ous felony, believing the evidence did not
warrant conviction. Further than that,
these three jurors decided to make an af
fidavit that they took such action and
hand it to Day's attorney. And when
that attorney. Hugh Aldrich, presented
the astonishing statement before Superior
Judge Greene to-day as the basis of his
motion for a new trial in behalf of hi3
client, such a storm of Judicial censure
broke upon those three jurors as has rare
ly burst from the Alameda County Super
ior Court.
: "It Is a dirty bird that befouls Its own
nest," sternly declared Judge Greene, hl3
face flushing, as he realized the Import of
the affidavit as Attorney Aldrich read it
from the bar.
"And that saying." continued his Honor,
"may Â¦well and truly apply to jurors, who
after taking their oath to try a case
fairly and impartially will, according to
their own sworn statements, agree to a
verdict of guilty when in their own minds
they are not satisfied of the defendant's
guilt.
Day had been called into court this
morning for sentence, but Aldrich inter
posed his motion. First he objected to the
District Attorney's action in examining
witnesses. Then he threw his b'.g bomb
shell In the shape of the following affi
davit:
Phil Klernan, P. C. Thorpe and H. J. "Waters,
each bolng duly sworn, depose and Bay. that
they and each cf them were Jurors sworn to try
the case of the People of the State of Califor
nia vs. William Day, in the Superior Court of
A-lameda County; that said trial began upon
September 27. at 10 o'clock a. m.. and that the
taking of testimony was completed on Septem
ber 28 at about 10 o'clock a. m. After argu
ments by counsel and charge of the court the
Jury, to* which we and each of us were a part,
was placed In charge of the Sheriff and locked
up at about 11 o'clock a. m. September 28.
After due deliberation and an exchange of
views a ballot was taken with the result of
eight for conviction and four for acquittal ;
that numerous other ballots were taken, the
next to the last resulting in nine for conviction
and three, for acquittal; that we. the affiants
hereto, were the three Jurors who voted for
acquittal because we were not satisfied that
the people had clearly made out the case
against the defendant, and that "each of us are
not now satisfied that the defendant was the
man that was se^n with the children upon Janu
ary 23 near Fifth and Henry streets, and that
each of us hereby aver that we and each of us
voted and assented to the verdict "guilty as
charged" only after we had notified the court
that we could not agree upon a verdict: that we
stated openly in the Jury room that we were
not satisfied as to the defendant's guilt: that
several members urged the verdict as they
could net stay during the night and all feared
that the court Intended keeping them. The
affiants then agreed to a verdict "guilty as
charged" provided that the balance of the Jury
would acknowledge that we and each of us had
to. stated that before we would vote for the
verdict so rendered, and that we had so agreed
that we three affiants should notify the attor
ney for the defendant and make affidavit to
what had been the Inducing cause for our vot
ing for the verdict as rendered, and the balance
of the Jury to agreed.

Maas Luders. who was foreman of the
jury, added the following certificate to
the correctness of the affidavit:
The undersigned, having been a member of

tifies that the statements made In the fore
coins: affidavit as having 'been made in the
jury room and before the verdict as rendered
fcs aere^d upon, are correct.
MAAS LUDEps, Foreman.
Attorney Aldrich said he realized that
nny man who would put himself in the
position of the jurors who made that af
fidavit was not entitled to the court's con
sideration. The lawyer's' purpose, , how
ever, was to show that his client had not
been conscientiously found guilty by. the
jury.
Judge Greene threw the affidavit out of
court, declaring that the courts had paid
no Juror could lm->each his own verdict.
"It the statement be correct," said his
Honor, "It will simply serve to blacken
the names of the men who make It. It
shows they had no respect for their oath,
nor realization of the duties of citizen
ship. If it la In my power to prevent
It. none of them will ever serve again in
any capacity In my court or in any de
partment of the Superior Court of Ala

ing of 20 per cent, or $40,000. in transporta

Heretofore the railroads have refrained
from bidding for the . transportation con
tracts and private contractors have re
ceived large profits. ;Â¦;Â¦.;Â¦Â¦

Assistant Chiefs Dougherty and Wills
fought the flames frorri ; the . Stevenson

danger of a general conflagration was
averted. . The loss sustained .by Hulse,
Bradford & Co. will be less than J1000.
Thpy were fully Insured. . â¢ -...
the calmest of men at a fire, had to give
vent to an expletive, In order to bring or
der out of chaos. . . â¢ â¢ Â¦ Â¦ . ' : .
A few minutes later the horses attached
to Chemical Knglne No. 1, which was
backed against the curb, took fright and
started to run away. In an Instant police
men, firemen and citizens grasped the
horses and brought them to a standstill,
not. however.-, until, the hose, which' was;
attached to the cylinder containing bi
carbonate of soda and sulphuric acid had
burst. Within a minute the air; was : filled
with geysers, which scattered: the crowd
much quicker than a policeman ; could.
The brave fireman who turned off the fire
extinguishing iiquld received a bath that
he neither wanted nor needed. Â¦Â¦Â¦'Â¦ .. â¢Â¦_
A fire laddie climbed up the fire escape
dropped, a bunch of small hose -on- one of
his mates and the recipient was saved
from a knockout by his heavy helmet.
Everything seemed to be at sixes and
sevens and Chief Sullivan, who Is usually
admiratlon of the hundreds of spectators,
who "rubbered" at the novel sight. :
"I will content myself,' Â¦ he said, "with
.advising the board to .be more : careful
regarding the methods employed to: carry
out the civil service system. I suggested
that ; the rules for each Â¦ examination be
adopted before it is held and under no
circumstances must they be changed; no
matter who suffers by adhering to them.
I am co-operating with the commission, to
make the system a perfect : success.*. For
my part I desire the fullest: light to be
thrown oh .its work and I will lend the
power of my office. to correct any abuse."
As an interesting example of the way in
which Phelan's pet civil Bervlce scheme
is working in the municipal administration
It is only necessary to call attention to
the fact that of. the three positions In
the Board of Public Works only two of
them have been filled from the civil ser
vice list, though they are all in the clas-
Asked- as to whether, he would direct an
Investigation Into the -action' of the Â¦ Civil
Service Commission, the Mayor said he
did not think it was necessary. ;V;.' :â¢'-::â¢'.
The Mayor is loth to : ascribe any; im
proper motives in the questionable: pro
ceeding.. of Commissioners Freud and
yulnn in reducing the maximum required
for experience as bookkeeper from ten
to five years, after the Board of Examin
ers had marked the examination papers.
His Honor, however, deemed; it his duty
to warn them that in future, they must
do nothing that would call down> upon
their heads: any unfavorable V criticism;
He notified Preud that his act, though
it may have twen. done, with no realization
of the probable results; was indiscreet and
he exhibited bad judgment In Its per*
Â¦formance.'.:. Â¦â¢;:-Â¦ ; â¢/..Â¦Â¦; Â¦Â¦;.;=â¢ ..' ; '-'-; : Â¦Â¦:'Â¦Â¦: /Â»^
. Mayor Phelan emphatically denies that
any favoritism was used In order tp'place
Leavy in Â¦ such a' pbigltion on the: ehglblo
list that he would- be. selected to be one
of the bookkeepers In the Board of Publl-i
Works.; . Phela .1 meets the charge: thai
Secretary Leo Park interested himself In
Leavy's case when he learned that : Leavy
was: sixth on the list by declaring 'that
Park did not visit him (the Mayor) to pro
cure Leavy's advancement; :. It was
charged that : Park and Freud were seen
comihgout of the Mayor's private office
on September 18, . but the Mayor states
that he was visiting: the public schools on.
that day in company with Chairman Mark
of the Board of Education and he did not
return: to his; office until after business
hours. '.He says that he Â¦ was not ap
proached by any one In Leavy's Interest.
"I have advised. the Civil Service Com
mission," , said the Mayor, "that hereafter
It must fix the weights or percentages
for each subject absolutely before the ex
amination takes place. â¢ After they Â¦ have
once been established they'must on no ac
count be changed,! consider this occur^
renipe as an unfortunate circumstance in
connection with the introduction of a new
system; Errors, will creep in no. matter
what precautions are taken. .' .- '
VT.he charge of favoritism is, I believe,
not supported by the facts.; The commis
siori. as I have learned* sought to correct
a mistake in making ten years' experience
in bookkeeping a condition for. receiving:
100 per cent for that :subject. They re-r
duced It to five years, which was. reason
able. That Injured nobody except those
who :had ten years' experience who. were
in the competition. The change, however,
was ill-advised 'arid should -have been,
made before the examination and not
after. It appears that Leavy. was the
enly one who benefited by the : - change,
Leavy is a relic of the: old Fragley admin
istratiori and. I am morally -sure that the
correction in the experience schedule was
made without any reference to him." :
The Board of Civil Service Commission
ers was censured yesterday by Mayor
Phelan for its action In raising the rating
of Leonard S. Lea vy ( who was thus en
abled to retain his position as bookkeeper
In the Board of Public Works by reason
of being advanced from the third to the
sixth place on the eligible list. .It was
a mild censure which his Honor felt callel
upon, to administer to his commission,
which has been given charge of the es
tablishment of the merit system in the
municipal government and which is sup
posed to carry out his desires, but it Was
a censure nevertheless. The rebuke was
not in; written form, but came from, the
Mayor verbally and contained the specific
injunction that the board in the future is,
under no consiaeration, to change the
weights of any. subjects after the examin
ation has once; been held. â¢: . :

ism in Leavy's Case, but Admits

Grand Opera Seats,
which there were present Mayor Phelah, :
Auditor Wells and Supervisors Hotaling
and Tobin of the Finance Committee, it
was decided yesterday to permit the con
tinuance of the illepal practice of borrow
ing from certain funds in the treasury to
pay demands on the general fund, which
is exhausted. This actign %vas taken not
withstanding the fact that the charter
. makes it illegal. Supervisor McCarthy
was present to press his resolution direct
ing an investigation of the Treasurer's
office for paying out unregistered de
mands to the exclusion of those that had
been registered.
Deputy Treasurer Perkins said it was
a well-known fact that taxes do not com
mence to accumulate until November and
as there was little or no money in the
general fund during July, August^ Sep
tember and October, it was the custom to
borrow from the sinking fund or other
funds to pay demands thereon, so that
the city's creditors should not suffer hard
ship. The demands .were -them carried as
cash until the Tax Collector made a set
tlement, when plenty of money would be
available. 'â¢ Â¦ â¢ .
Mayor Phelan agreed with Perkins and
took refuge behind the fact that the prac
tice of borrowing from funds was univer
sal. To a question of the Mayor, Auditor
\\ ells replied that there was no danger
or irregularity in the practice.
McCarthy thought that the Supervisors
should have passed a resolution allowing
the temporary transfer of funds and ad
hered to his contention that the practice
was illegal. A- public office. â¢ he said
should be conducted on legal principles.
Clerk Russell said that the custom . hart
been In vogue for many years without any
authorization from the Supervisors and it
had never been questioned before.
Tobin held that the only course to pur
sue was either to obey, the-' law. and create
a municipal panjc or disobey the law and
save the creuilof the city. Phelan sug
gested a constructive apportionment of
the funds in the city treasury to meet the
contingency. ! Auditor Wells advised the
payment of the money so long as it was
in the treasury, and it could be replaced
when taxes were collected. Perkins said
that about $1,000,000 would soon come into
the treasury from taxes and an apportion
ment could be made by November 15. Per
kins asked that the Finance Committee
recommend approval of the action of the
Treasurer in paying demands out of bor
rowed funds. The Mayor demurred to
this course as being unnecessary. .
"It is a question of disobeying the char
ter, heuaid, "and until some one calls
mv attention to it, I can take no action."
Perkins informed the Mayor that Mr.
McCarthy had called attention to the Ille
gal proceeding in the columns of The Call,
but the Mayor would not accept that fact
as a notice of the charter violation.
In regard to McCarthy's charge that un
registered demands had been paid in ad
vance of registered ones Perkins pleaded
that they were paid unadvertently. . Only
a few had been so paid, but Perkins prom
ised to complv with the Mayor's injunc
tion that registered demands must take
precedence and he promised to comply
with the charter In future. i

CREDITORS TO BE PAID
WITH BORROWED FUNDS
Bifled service; The board has appointed
Leavy and T.' J. Crowley topositions. but
has ae yet failed to, makÂ©; a requisition
upon the commission' for a person to nil
the: third place though it is required by
the charter to do so; . Nearly two months
have passed since the list of eligibles was
announced, so the Board of '.Public Works
must admit that it ihas . had ample time
to comply with the law on that score.
The third position,: which' carries with
it a salarj' of. $55 per month, is held by
John C. Newlands. who was appointed
several months ago. before the office was
classified for civil service. Newlands took
the examination for bookkeeper at the
same time as Leavy, but he. is number.12
on the list and :: therefore could not be
certified for 'the '.third place by the com
mission. Had he bÂ«en fifth the requisition
on the commission for his services would
undoubtedly have been made. The Board
of Public works has failed to call for a
third bookkeeper because the eligibles are
not agreeable to its desires. in the matter
and allows Newlands. to ; continue In the
position at its Own sweet will, ... Â¦Â¦ .
Chief Examiner Moran states that the
commission had taken no action in this
case as It believed that the Board. of Pub.
lie Works has the authority to designate
the nature: of the services of its employes.
The charter provides that the Board ox
Public Works '.'may" appptnt such em*
ployes as it sees fit. Newlands is now
classed as an assistant bookkeeper. on. the
salary roll and Moran is ot the opinion
that this might exclude him -.from the cat
egory of bookkeepers. , : . Â¦Â¦Â¦"''Â¦'Â¦\ Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦â',: '_j^

Of course no. family would rent
a piano if thej' thought that they
could afford to buy one. It is only
natural to prefer ownership to
renting.
If a family can afford to rent a
piano they can afford to own one
by means of the new rent contract
plan of Sherman. Clay & Co.
This plan is different from the
usual installment plan. The' pay-
ments are S6.00 a month, which
go toward the payment of the
piano. Why, there are many
homes right here in San Fran-
cisco who are paying: $4.00. $5.00
and $6.00 a month merely renting
a piano.
Own your pianoâ investigate
Sherman, Clay & Co.'s new plan.

and organs waiting your inspec-
