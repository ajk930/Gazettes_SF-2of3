phyeScians are puzzled over the case of
James B. Ferguson, the famous breeder
and etarter of thoroughbreds. He lies In
bed from the effects of .the passage of
X-rays through his body.
In order to locate a bullet, as prelimi
nary 4o an operation for ltÂ» â¢ removal,
Ferguson had the professor of phyfics at
the State University make an X-ray pic
ture of his body. This was done, and he
was seized with violent vomiting fits,
which took away his already falling
strength. He has been In very bad health"
for some months and came to Kentucky
to recuperate. He is now quartered at
his elegant home near Lexington and will
aubmlt to an operation for the 1 removal
of the bullet In case he can regain suffi

ATLANTA, Texas, Oct. 21.â A tornado
election will not take place until next
but already the warmth ex
hibited In the 'contest Is surprising. Mrs.
Daniel Manning's second term will expire
at that time. Mrs. Manning has been crit
icised by some of the Daughters as being
too much of'an aristocrat. One member
of the board is a clerk In the Pension Of
fice :_ another, although of aristocratic
lineage, runs a boarding-house. Mrs.
Manning neglected her social duties Inso
much that she did not extend her cour
tesy to the point of calling upon theee la

ably will stand In the way oj, her election

did not -wait to see the result of his shot,

cried, as he drew a revolver from his

The stranger turned toward Griffin with
an oath.
"Leave that â¢woman alone." he shouted
as he ran toward the place where the man

Griffin was returning from a dance at
Central Hall, on Twenty-second street and

But ancestry and opportunity are not
enough. They must be coupled with en
ergy and application â that sort of appli
cation that knows no tiring." Men move
forward by the power that is within them
ânot by that behind them or about them.
John Sherman began to * recognize this
fact at the age of fourteen, when he be-
HIS EABXY STRUGGLES.
With such a paternal ancestry and such
a mother as John Sherman must have
hadâ with these two supreme essentials
supplemented by tne spur of poverty and
breathing the atmosphere of enterprise
and expansion that frontier lads wero
wont to breathe, it is not surprising that
the late senior Senator from Ohio rose to
ti*e height to which he attained. In
deed, the surprise is rather that more
boys of equal ancestryâ vastly more in this
country of limitless possibilities, do not
rank with the brightest and ablest of our
land.
But a few years ago there were three
conspicuous men In the United States
Senate, all three cousins of some degree,
and all related-either in the line of direct
descent or collaterally through the blood
of Roger Sherman. One of these Is still
in the upper house of Congressâ George
Frisbie Hoar. William M. Kvartshas re
tired from public life, taking with him
rich laurels of fame well earned as a
jurist, as a statesman and as a man. and
John Sherman is dead.
Before Roger Sherman, too, there was
good blood. This almost goes without
saying, as he never would have been what
he was. There Is an occasional outcrop
ping of genius, however, when there is
no family precedent to account for it. But
even In these cases a careful, tracing of
the blood would be pretty cure to reveal
quality In ancestry that would account
for the seemingly unaccountable.
But before Judge Sherman the father
of these two distinguished sons, away
back a century and a half ago. was a
young man in Connecticut, whose voca
tion was that of the cobbler. The boots
that he. made were better, so runs the
story, than those that came from'. other,
hands, though the men In those days were
less clever at trickery than some Con
necticut Yankees In later years. But this
young man had a soul for something be
yond making strong boots forthe rugged
settlers thereabouts, and so aÂ« he pegged
away at the leather he stored his. mind
with a knowledge of the lav.-. It .was In
17C0 that this same cobbler, now 40 years
of age and known as Roger Sherman, be
came prominent as a Revolutionary lead
er. His fame spread throughout the thir
teen colonies, and when the Continental
Congress was created Roger Sherman be
came one, of its leading members, serv
ing continuously from 1774 to 17S8. He
was a remarkable man, possessed of
strong commonsense, intense feeling and
an Intuitive knowledge of the true prin
ciples of government.
But Mrs. Sherman was one of those
brave, determined women who have made
our country great among the nations. So
well did she perform fhe work left to her
hands to do that one of sons. William
Tecumseh ShÂ«Â°rmnn. became with one ex
ception the first military hero of the land,
and the other. John Sherman, became one
of the preatest^men of his political faith
in the l*nited States Senate, if not the
greatest of any party in that body.
John Sherman was born at Lancaster,
Ohio, May 10, 1S32. Nevertheless he was a
typical New t'nglander. and his t:Ul. an
gular figure, his plain, simpl-? tast;s. his
cool, reasoning temperament were all New
England traits; and well might they have
been.'foj- it was from this soil his ances
try was nurtured. Ills father and mother
emigrated to Ohio from Connecticut and
settled on the famous Western" Reserve,
a district populated for the most part by
New Englandcrs. The pioneer Sherman
â¢was a lawyer uf distinguished ability. His
advancement in his profession. In what
was then little more than the frontier,
was rapid, but at 40 years of age his life
went out. he beliiK at the time one of the
Judges of the S-jpreme Court of Ohio. The
widow was l*ft with eleven children to
provide for and educate. The youngest
was fr'zi. a itr.r_ months olfÂ«. -the eldest
bar.riy IS. Judge Sherman had ..accumu
lated no surplus. He died poor. It was
an appalling outlook for a young ambi
tious womanâ such a problem as would
turn the head of a fin <1<Â» slecle mother.
NEW YORK. Oct. a.â Tbe Can-Herald
forecast of the Presidential election gave
politicians material for (Uscussloa f rom

were delighted with the prognostication.
Democrats were displeased. FsJr-mlnded
men In both parties frankly sa!d that the
poll had been fairly made and accurately
represented the situation at thl= time. Tbe

General Francis V. Greene, president of i

"I think The Call-Herald's predictions j
are about correct as to the general result

State. The candidate for Governor In

At the headquarters of the Democratla

carefully read. The effect was exactly
the opposite from that at Republican
headquarters. It gave the Democrats lit
tle comfort. They have been counting
with confidence on carrying the House of
Representatives, even If they should lose
the Presidency, and the disclosure of
weak places In their lines was far from
gratifying. ,.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WEIXDfQ.
TOX HOTEL, WASHINGTON. Oct. tLâ
Politicians of all parties looked forward to
the election predictions of The Call and
the New York Herald this morning with,
great Interest. Republicans found much
to cheer them In the review of the politi
cal situation throughout the country. The
Democrats, on the other band, found llttla
consolation In It. Conservative Demo
crats, while still keeping up a show of
claiming the election of Mr. Bryan and a
majority in the House of Representa
tives, admitted that the poll showed evi
dence of careful work and .was undoubt
edly a fair presentation of the conditions
prevailing a fortnight before the election.
At the Eastern headquarters of tha Re
publican Congressional . Committee The
Call-Herald poll was In great demand to
day, and returns from several States -were
carefully gone over and analyzed. The
poll as a whole agrees .well with the In
formation of the committee as to the con
ditions throughout tbe country, though
there is a disposition on the part of tha
Republican managers to claim rather
more Congressional districts than have
been put down in the Vsure" column by
The Call. Most of those classed as doubt
ful would be put Into the Republican' col
umn.
Representative Loudenslager, who !Â» In

not care to discuss particular districts for
publication, but he said:
"We have felt confident from tbe be
ginning of the campaign that Mr. McKln

majority In the Electoral College. "We,
have also felt sure that we would have a

eight years, and then was elevated to the
Senate, where he served for seventeen
consecutive years, resigning from that
body to become Secretary of the Treasury
under Hayes.' f '
It was as the head of the Treasury De
partment that Mr. Sherman did perhap3
the best work of his life. He was a born
financier. In 1874, several years before
Mr. Hayes was even thought of In con
nectlon with the Presidency. Mr, Sher
man Introduced - a- bill providing *f or the
resumption of specie payments on Jan
uary . I, 1870. He had little thought, no
doubt, of .being the man to bring that pur
pose to a , practical realization. " But in
1877, he was made Secretary of. the-Treas
ury, and -the work of preparing for the
resumption fell to, his hands. He .did this
so well that when the appointed day came

financial circles, though theorists and pes-,

would ensue. But with John Sherman at

Sherman came much nearer a duel dur

to fcc shot at that time and prepared him
self for defense. lit was making a speech
cne day, when a member nar%ed Wright
of Tennfjsfe said that one of his state
ments was a lie. Sherman did not hear
the remark, but It was reported to him
that evening and the next day It appeared^
in the Globe newspaper. Sherman rose
to a question cf privilege. He said he had
not heard the remark and he supposed
that the gentleman who made it was In
s-uch a condition (drunk) that he didn't
know what he was saying. As he said i

Sherman picked up a box of wafers and

It was his great familiarity with our
finances and his distinction as a creative
financier that caused so many expressions
of surprise that Mr. McKinley should se
lect Senator Sherman as head of the De
partment of State. His ability for the lat
ter post was not questioned, out he had
proved himself, as the head of the Treas

financial measures of far-reaching im-.

Causes That Led to His Resignation
Senator Sherman's, relations with Presi
dent McKlnley as Secretary of State were
not altogether pleasant. He was never
a diplomat, 'but rather a man of strong
sentiments, direct and straightforward,
so much so that from the terseness of
some of his communications In dealing
with foreign affairs he was dubbed a
"shirt sleeves" diplomat. He never hesi
tated to say exactly what he thought and
this characteristic somewhat shocked the
Ministers and representatives of some of
the European powers. Indeed, to such an
extent was the subject discussed that
shortly before his resignation was
brought about it was published that the
mind of the great statesman was failing
and he was practically forced to resign
from the cabinet.
Slrtee that time Senator Sherman prac
tically retired from public life. â¢
Although for nearly half a century John
Sherman had been one of the leading
men of the country, his chlefest ambition
was never gra titled. More than once had
he sought Presidential honors, but as
often had his ambition been balked when

HEBRESHOFF READY TO
BTJTLD NEW DEFENDER
Blind Wizard Has Already Designed
the Craft and Awaits Order
for Its Construction.
NEW. YORK. Oct. 21.â The World has
this from Bristol: That a ninety-footer
will be built to defend the America's cup
and that Herreshoff will design, construct
and try her out. as he did so sucessfully
with the Vigilant, Defender and the Co
lumbia, is certain. Some of the men In
close touch with the Herreshoffs and who
will have much to do with the successful
execution of Designer Nat Herreshoff's
plans say an order is expected shortly
for the new defender and work will be
started upon the next cup champion
within a few hours of the signing of the
contract. There Is not the slightest doubt
of the ability of Herreshoff to turn out
such a yacht, fully equipped for business.
by the middle of next July. The design
ing, they believe, has been doneâ i. e., the
yacht has been planned out in the head
of Nat, the wizard, since the Columbia-
Shamrock races last year. All that re
mains Is to reduce to the scribbling board
the plans now matured in his wonderful
mind and order the materials which will
enter into the construction of the yacht.
It is believed the next cup d- tender will
be more of a cutter than the Columbia
and of slightly greater draught, givinjc
an even better play to the speed produc
ing "tumble homes" which stood tho
American yacht in such good stead dur
ing the races last year. When well heeled
to a strong topsail breeze the Columbia
with all her deep and heavy keel, was lit
tle better than a skimmlns dish, and
while steadily eating up into the wind'
was covering space like a torpedo-boat
catcher.
As Captain Nat Is the only man in .the
world who. seems to have mastered the
bulbed fin keel, it is needless to say tha*
the new yacht will be of that type. The
HerreshofTs know how to so balance this
keel that no difficulty is experienced in
steering. The steel spars, though they are
costly and even more liable to buckle than
the sturdy Oregon pine which has adorned
and assisted most cup defenders, proved
their worth in such marked degree last
year that they will undoubtedly be an
important feature of the nezt cup de
fender.

Prior to the publication of this agree
ment the belief existed in diplomatic cir
cles that an understanding regarding
China existed between Russia and Ger
many. This Is now dispelled. It Is apprte
ciated here that the one power Germany
and Great Britain bad in view in making
the agreement was Russia. In diplomatic
circles It lsÂ»not considered unlikely that
Russia will adhere to the agreement In
compliance with the Invitation to be ad
dressed to her. and. what is more, she
will in<all likelihood live up to it, probably
more strictly than she would otherwise
have done In order not to give either Ger
many or Great Britain a pretext for
breaking It The United States can, of
course, be depended upon not to make any
move contemplating the 'acquisition of
territory, and Japan has repeatedly as
serted that, she will not extend her sov-'
erelgnty over Chinese territory, unless the
other nations do so. Italy and Austria,
bowing to the will of Germany, will- not
delay the giving of their formal adherence
to the agreement.
Notwithstanding the doubt - which , en
velops the attitude of Germany and Great
Britain as a result of the negotiation of
the agreement, it Is believed here that the
United States still holds the balance of
The authorities do not conceal their be
lief that the Anglo-German agreement Is
one of the most significant of recent dip
lomatic developments, and they propose
to get at its meaning as promptly as pos
sible. Before the President will give as
sent'to any of the provisions of the in
strument he will ascertain the exact
meaning of article 3.
A distinguished gentleman weH ac
quainted with :ecent developments in the
Chinese question said to-nfght that the
"third article of the Anglo-German agree
ment Is like a Delphic oracle. It can be
construed In any way, according to the
view of the person making the interpreta
tion." It may mean that the two powers
are determined to take advantage of any
suspicious act on the part of another to
nelze Chinese territory, or it may mean
that the two powers will bring pressure
to bear upon the offending power to com
pel it to relinquish such territorial de
signs as indications may show It pos
sesses. The latter Is not the view gener
ally prevalent in official and diplomatic
circles.
The third article specifically declares
that "two contracting parties reserve to
themselves the right to come to a prelim
inary understanding regarding the event
ful etep to be taken for the protection of
their own interests in China," and from
this it is evident that the two nations will
support each other's pretentlons by force
of arms ehould circumstances require it.
Nevertheless the administration is high
ly gratified with the first two articles of
the convention, reiterating, as they do,
the declarations which have been the key
note of Secretary Hay's policy from the
outset of the present trouble, and there is
no doubt that the President will. In a note
to the powers, willingly express his ap
proval of these features of the treaty.
The third article, however, is one re
garded with suspicion, and this suspicion
Is the more Intense because of Germany's
peculiar policy and of the action of Great
Britain in landing troops at Shanghai. No
doubt Is expressed that the negotiations
between Great Britain and Germany
which resulted in the agreement Involved
a discussion of the territory each proposes
to acquire in the event of dismember
ment ?:-:.
CALL. HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. Oct. 21.â
Pending the receipt of an official interpre
tation of the third article of the Anglo-
German agreement, the administration
authorities are disinclined to be quoted as
to the international effect of its pro
visions. It is, of course, impossible for
the President alone to formally announce
the adherence of the United States to the
convention. Before the instrument can be
binding upon this Government it must be
ratified by the United States Senate. The
present complexion of the Senate makes
It doubtful If a ratification could be ob
tained.

VICTORIA, B. C. Oct. 21.â According to
a correspondent of the Shanghai Mercury,
Bishop MontosatI in South Hunan was
tortured four hours by the Chinese. Dif
ferent members of his body were removed
singly. Two priests were covered with

PARIS, Oct. 21.â The Anglo-German
agreement to maintain the territory and
integrity of China and to keep her ports
open to the commerce of the world con
tinues to monopolize public attention in
France, the omission of the name of Rus
sia, according to the version of the agree
ment supplied by.the Havas agency, being
the chief subject of comment. The Tempa
says:
"We can see nothing in the immediate
sense of the agreement which does not
merit approbation, but the elimination of
Russia's name is calculated to hurt her
feelings by showing distrust, even sup
posing the intentions of the two powers
to be the purest. It Is to be regretted that
the wording of the agreement gives an
appearance of hostility to an ally. The
work of peace is not furthered by throw
ing a bomb.
"There are two important points In the
agreement. The first is that "the second
article destroys somewhat the value of
the protocol's disinterestedness by reserv
ing to the contracting parties the right to
make eventual arrangements according to
the behavior of a third party. The sec
ond point Is that if this specific accord In
dicates* a lasting understanding between
Germany and Great Britain it will be t
thanks to^the sad Transvaal war, the
realization of a favorite plan of Lord
Salisbury and Mr. Chamberlain and at
the same time the starting point of a
new era in international relations."
The Journal des Debate, after express
ing a doubt that the agreement is directed
against Russia, asks whether, on the con
trary, Germany and Great Britain, having
accepted the situation as it effects the es
tablishment of Russia north of the great
wall, have not excluded from that region
other powers who are prohibited from ex
tending themselves at the expense of
China. f. â¢
"If this be the case," It says, "it is the
Integrity of China proper which the two
contracting powers guarantee. Before
giving a definite opinion regarding the at
titude we must know the attitude of Rus
sia, for the importance of the agreement
depends entirely upon whether it is or is
not hostile to missia." ' ,
After Â¦ the foregoing and similar com
ments had appeared- In the French press
it became known that all the papers had
been put upon a false scent by an error in
transmitting the text of the agreementâ
the omission of the name of Russia among
the names of the powers to whom Â¦ the
agreement Is to be communicated. All
the comments were written upon the the

A prominent local official of tha Union

The strikers here believe that the com

"All that we can expect to enforce is
that we get the 10 per cent." said he. "It

this way, however. He says the conven

that the end of tha strike is generally be

Judge Holt's presence attracted many.
NEW YORK. Oct. n.â The World has
the following from Hamlin..W, Va.: Judge
John H. Holt. Democratic- candidate for
Governor of West Virginia, who in his
marvelous campaign has rocked babies,
baked <*Â»iraplSngs for country ncuse wives
and fiddled ani sung In nearly every
cousty in the Stcte. periorcne*! his great
est feat here yesterday. Ail the people
In the vicinity TÂ»ere assembled at old
Judge S^fann's hospitable country home.
The cause of the festivities was the an
nual meeting cf the Daughters of Rebekah.
and they were present forty and
forty fair. Alter a sumptuous banquet
beneath spreading oaks Judge Swann an
nounced that he had sixty geese ready
and willing to be picked, and su^gv.sted as
& diversion that the Vixen County lasses
try their hands. A house-raising, a corn
shucklcg, an apple-peeling or a beAn-
Etringing could not have met louder ac
claim, and forthwith each fa'r damsel
went to Â¦work.
They were in the midst of their gay
labor when, mounted upon his old gray
mare. Judge Holt rode up to the gate.
The Judge dismounted and. having greet
ed ever* body ajjd kissed the 9-months-old
grandchild of old Judge Swann, he soon
was seated beneath a tree with to. goose in
his lap, hard at work.
Suddenly during a lull, still picking
away a.t the goose. Judge Holt remarked
in his deliberate way:
"ThiB reminds we of one of my joint de
bates with White."
<Â«ulck as a flash Uncle Mose caught his
banjo, and Judge Holt, dropping his vio
lin took the hand of old Aunt Melissa, his
black mammy, standing in the doorway,
Â¦who had nursed him as a baby. At the
head of the procession they marched to
the time of "Befo 1 de Wah. My Love," the
tall, slender man with clear cut, cameo
face holding by the hand the old negro
woman with all the grace of knight of old
as though she were the fairest lady of
the land.
"Everybody and all cake-walk." he said.
Every window was filled with darky
faces, and occasionally some old gray
headed negro who had known Judge Holt
from his boyhood would say:
"Well, now. ain't it a plum sight to
see Marse John." \
And it was. As midnight approached
the last figure was to be called. Judge
Holt was equal to the emergency.
Judge Holt's body swayed and his foot
kept time, while ever and anon above the.
music could be heard his clear voice as he
cried: ""tilt the puncheon, everybody â all
do-sle-do."
"Face your partners, all Join hands and
give your partners a hot time." he called,
and the dance was on.
and all Â¦were anxious to eee "Johnnie," as
they called him. At night, aifter supper,
the spacious dining hall was cleared for
a dance. Arrangements had been made
for an old darky to play and call the
figures. He Â¦was there Â¦with his banjo, but
so was Judge Holt with his fiddle, for the
Judge always carries It strapped to his
saddle when In the rural districts, and
nothing would do but he must take old
Uncle Mose's place. The Judge took a
chair and In a trice the couples were In
their places, nnd West Virginia's states
man drew his magic bow across the
strings.

In a starving condition. That news was

is a fair specimen of the other 200 peop'.e
left in the lonely district. He was in a
frightful condition and had been so weak
for the last day on the trail that he could
not sit astride his horse. He was com
pelled to work his way the last five miles,
crawling on his hands and knees.
He says that on account of the strike of
fishermen on the Fraser River the Indiana
caught no salmon, and consequently re
turned to their homes in the interior with
out supplies. Late m July the river was
flooded worse than the memorable floods
of 1894, and crops were spoiled. Several
lives were lost. When the messenger left
there was not a pound of flour or potato e a
in the camp. A pack train Is now being
organized at Agassiz by the Indian agent,

of having visited the scene of his pres

Russian America across Bering Straits to

when the completion - by Cyrus Field of
the first trans-Atlantic cable rendered the
plan useless. The work was entrusted to
Charles Buckley - as chief and
the party of which Libby was a member.

this time, while making a voyage from
Port Clarence to Norton Sound, that Lfb
by found at the headwaters of the Neuck
luck' River an auriferous gravel whlct:
had been washed down by that stream.
Believing it to contain ' pold in paying
quantities Libby and a companion stopped
and prospected. Confident that they were
to be in the country the following winter
LJbby and his associates decided to say
nothing of their find:
In July subsequent to this discovery a
steamer came and took away the Western
Union party, the telegraph scheme having
been abandoned. It was not untlll 1899
that Libby again visited Alaska. Thu
company In which he Is now principal

Luck's 'next murder with the ax was
five years ago, when he killed a Siwash
at Chilliawack. The Indian had been
working on Wells' ranch, and, the Celes
tial says, was stealing chickens from him.
So one morning he called at the Indian's
cabin and brained the unfortunate man as
he stepped out of the door. He carried his
body for a mile, and it was not found for
several weeks. By that time he was liv
ing in another part cf ~ie country. A
white man was tried for the crime of the
murder, but fortunately was acquitted.
The Chinaman says he had meant to
kill Chief Main for a long time. Main
had suspicions of his stealing operations
around Steveston for a long time and had
been closely watering him. So when the
Chief came to his house after stolen prop
erty he went out of the back door and got
the ax. The Chief was stooping over a
sack, and he cut his head open with the
sharp edge of a big double-bitted weapon.
Yip Luck Is abnormally strong, can lift
several hundred pounds with ease and is
as agile as a cat.
He confessed to Main's murder at the
fall assizes, and swore that his alleged
companion in crime was innocent. -Yip
Luck gloats over the crimes a^s he tells
of how he killed all three men with an
ax. He says the first one was ten years
ago, near Yale, 100 miles from the coast.
The death of a colored man named Clem
ents was always a mystery there. Clem
ents' mangled body was found in a
stream. His skull was smashed through
the middle and a leg was missing. Yip
Luck says he met the colored man when
the latter was returning from shooting.
Clements had a deer and the Chinaman
demanded half. Clements' answer was to
draw his gun and order the Chinaman to
run, but the latter rushed at the big
negro with an axe and was more than a
match for him. He killed him and threw
his body into the stream a half-minute
later.

SAN JOSE, Oct. 21.â C. J. Martin,

been a lifelong Democrat and has been

an open letter he says:
"The Issue of the present campaign
and the tendencies of the Democratia
party under the influences now controlling
it are such that I feel compelled to opposa
it in the coming election, and so long as
it may be dominated by the forces that
now make It untrue to genuine Democ
racy. I supported Mr. Bryan in 1S96 as a
loyal partisan, believing him to bo a sin
cere man and a genuine reformer, but his
course has since convinced me that he Is
more of a demagogue than & reformer and
Is bent solely upon his own ambitions. I
also see in Mr. Bryan's election and the
declarations of the Kansas City platform
a direct menace to the fruit Industry of
California. My chief objection to the can
dilates of the Democratic party ancj tÂ»
the persona now temporarily shaping tho
policy of that party la that they have de
parted from " true Democratic policies,
which I find better represented now by
the Republican than by the Democratic*
party. It is therefore with regret that I
break off a party connection of many
years In order to remain true to the prin
ciples which I have always held."
LA REPORT. Oct. 21.â One of the best
and most enthusiastic political meetings
ever known to Lakeport was held last
night. The largest hall in the town was
filled to overflowing, many being turned
away.
Ernest Weyand of Colusa, nominee for
the Assembly from the Tenth District,
and Robert Corlett of Napa, nominee for
Senator frcm the Seventh District, spoke
briefly but agreeably and with good effect.
Hon. Thomas I!. Bond, ex-Superior
Judge of Mendocino County, and for sev
eral years a citizen ofi JLakeport, was ac
corded a most nattering teeeption stnd
made, a telling address.
"For forty-eight years," he said, "I
have voted the Democratic ticket, but the
time has come when I- must choose be
tween a Republican and a Populist, and I
do not hesitate." The Judge is an in
telligent man and has attained consider
able prominence both along legal and po
litical lines. He was one of the attorneys
before the United States Supreme Court
in the Modesto irrigation case, a delegate
tour years ago to the national convention
of the Gold Democrats and one of their
candidates for Presidential Elector.
"If I live until the sixth day of Novem
ber," he concluded. "I will cast my first
vote for a Republican President." His
defection is a body blow to the local
Democracy.
D. E. McKlnlay followed Judge Bond
and held the audience immovable for
nearly two hours. His logical dissection
of party platforms and laying bare of hol
low shams and pretended issues has
brought many doubtful ones into line, and

All apprehensions of a possible scarcity of money
in New York have been allaj'ed by the reflux of gold

unless something unforeseen turns up. London con
tinues to fell our stocks on the slightest advance,
though this is due more to the need of ready money
in England than to any distrust of our securities. The
volume of American securities now held in Europe
is said to be smaller than for some years, which is a
eood sign, as it relieves us from the liability of having
large blocks of our stocks thrown back upon us, to
the impairment of our spot funds. The situation of
the United States in reference to Europe is especially
favorable, and it would require a financial storm of
more than ordinary* magnitude to upset our financial

BUSINESS CONDITIONS CHEERFUL
TRADE reports from the different sections of
the country continue encouraging. Business is
quiet, of course, with the exception of a few
lines, and the best reports are coming from the South
and Pacific Coast Here we are kept busy by the
continual Government demand for army and navy
supplies for the Orient, and it is expected that this
demand will continue for several years. Indeed, the
purchases of oats and hay alon* here and on the
Sound have materially advanced quotations for both
products, much to the gratification of the farmer,
and, what is more, have cut down stocks so that good
markets for next year are almost assured. Certainly
the Pacific Coast farmer has reason to bless that
national policy which returns him good profits on his
land, and this is probably one of the chief reasons
why that policy is so popular on this coast.
Lower cotton has not depressed the South, for
the best reports are from that section, the consump
tive demand for merchandise being brisk and liberal.
New England is quiet, except in boots and shoes,
which maintain the improvement noted several weeks
ago. The demand is not limited to fall goods, but
lias extended to Orders for next spring, though the
manufacturers are trying to keep the increased sales
quiet for fear of advancing the hide and leather
markets. Both the latter are firm, however, in sym
pathy with the manufactured goods. The wool trade,
too, is picking up in the East, and sales show an in
crease, being larger rhan for a long time, though still
below the abnormal activity of a year or so ago. Re
ports from the iron trade are reassuring. More fur
paces have gone into blast, and the demand is said
tc be improving, though all large buyers are holding:
off until after the election. Small advances in billets
and pigiron are reported at several points. Railroad
earnings are making a good showing, being larger
than during the summer, and the export trade of the
countr> r is in fine condition, the exports for September
being the largest ever reported for that month, while
the returns for the nine months ending September
30 are far in advance of any previous year. It is con
fidently expected that 1900 will break all previous
records in the outward foreign trade. Wheat, how
ever, continues to rule weak, and has declined again,
owing to large shipments from foreign countries to
the world's chief markets.
It is not pleasant to charge i candidate > for the
Presidency with personal vindictiveness, but that is
the report made of Bryan's conduct in his own State
and by those who know him best. It is a revelation
of his utter inconsistency on the trust question and a
warning" to the people not to confide in him any gov
ernmental power .whatever.
This view. of Bryan as he appears in Nebraska is
cne never taken elsewhere. The prevailing opinion
has been that Bryan, despite his financial vagaries and
his tendencies toward demagogy, is on the whole a
genial, good-natured sort of man, hurling invectives
against capital out of rhetorical exuberance, but with
out malice. If the Nebraskans, however, be right,
Bryan is quite a different man, and should he be
elected he will enter office animated by a desire to
punish all who opposed his election. He will put into
power an Attorney General who will undertake to
drive out of business every corporation composed of
men who supported McKinley, while he .will have
nothing but favors for the ice trust, the round cotton
bale trust and other combinations controlled by Tam
many or by other Democratic leaders.
It is said the starch company pays good wages to
250 persons, has been of immense benefit to the in
dustries and the trade of Nebraska City, and tjuring
the last ten years has paid over $2,000,000 to farmers
in the neighborhood for corn. It has never done any
thing in restraint of trade. Yet that important local
industry Bryan is now trying to break up for the
purpose of gratifying his political spite against the
Gold Democrats among its stockholders who refuse
to support his pretensions to the Presidency. He is
seeking to injure his qfwn State and his fellow-citizens
merely to gratify a vindictive spirit. i
WILLIAM J. BRYAN has not much of a repu
tation abroad, and j'et such repute as he has at
a distance from his home is much more favor
able to him than that which he has established among
his neighbors. The old saying, "Go away from home
to learn news," is one that Bryan will doubtless care
fully inculcate whenever it is a question of learning
news concerning himself. On the Atlantic coast and on
the Pacific coast he has been exposed in many an
evasion of vital issues of the campaign, and has be
come known as a dodger and a good deal of a faker
in politics, but titles of that .kind are mild in com-"
parison to those applied to him by his neighbors
and fellow-citizens of Nebraska.
The reason why the people of his own State arc
more severe than the people of other parts of th^
country in condemning Bryan is that they have under
their eyes in their own homes an illustration not only
of the insincerity but of the vindictiveness of the
man. There is in Nebraska City a business enter
prise known as the National Starch Company, largely
under the control of Gold Democrats like J. Sterling
Morton, who was Secretary of Agriculture- during
Cleveland's second administration. There is also in
Nebraska a silver smelting company at Omaha, which
is under control of Bryan's political friends.- Now
Br3 r an has denounced the starch company as a trust
and he has incited his fellow-partisan, the Attorney
General of the State, to institute proceedings to
break it up, or at least to drive it out of Nebraska;
but he has had not one word in the way of con
demnation to say of the silver smelting company,
which from all reports appears to be a real "trust."

A HOME VIEW OF BRYflN.
The thought of constructing 50,000-ton battleship^
is likely to make the .British taxpayer turn pale, -for if
they once be launched by any nation the British tax
payer will have a good many of them to construct and
to pay for. Fortunately for him the Zeppelin airship
promises to be something of a success, for short trips,
at any rate, and, should it prove effective, the building
of sea ships for war purposes will hardly be carried
much beyond the point now attained.
As to the effect of the use of such shells in naval
warfare, a British authority is quoted as/ saying the
Belleisle experiments showed that lyddite may burst
against armor without any effect worth mentioning,
but that if a shell once landed in a ship and exploded
she would have no fighting force left. He then went
on to say: "Great distance makes hitting difficult and
makes the skill of the gunner the final arbitrator. The
big lyddite shell is likely, therefore, to do little at pres
ent beyond adding a thousand yards to the recognized
fighting range. In the future, however, there is another
thing it may do â alter the size of . the ships. The
present mastodons may double their enormous bulft.
Already the French, who always lead in plans of this
kind* have projected a battleship of 30,000 tons odd.
Such <a vessel would not be so greatly incommoded
<rven by a 12-inch lyddite. The other alternative is to
make ships smaller, so that one. or two may be lost
without the general total being much affected. This h
no new propositionâ it is trotted out with every new
invention. Butttis the less likely ; of the two. Far
more probable is it that the naval architect will first
lay himself out' to create something biggerâ thirty,
forty, or even fifty thousand tons in displacement." â¢
In describing a test made with a gun of 9.2-inch
caliber the London Chronicle says: "To begin with,
it was fired at a target about 1500 yards distant from
the gun. When it burst fragments of the shell were
flung back nearly 800 yards â half a mile â toward the
gun; that is to say, the distance of a very fair rifle
range. This, however, was merely the mildest part
of the explosion; fragments at the sides were actually
hurled a whole mile away! The detonation was likrj
a clap of thunder just overhead, while at the target
there rose a huge tree of green smoke as high as the
clock tower at Westminster, but of far greater bulk.
A mile away men felt a heavy blow across their faces
from the concussion. And this, be it remembered,
was a relatively small shell compared with the sort of
thing that will be fired in the next naval battle."
fiV\ OST people will easily recall the lurid tales
/ \ that were told: in the early days of the South.
* * African war of the effects of the explosion of
lyddite shells fired by the British against the Boers.
It will also be recalled that after a time there came
reports of quite a different nature; so that .while- the
first stories depicted the explosive as something so
terrible that it blew whole mountain tops away and
destroyed regiments with one shell, the later stories
were to the effect that lyddite shells are hardly more
dangerous than tom-toms, making a mighty noise in
deed, but rarely killing anybody.
The truth concerning the effectiveness of the ex
plosiveness in war appears to lie between the two ex
tremes of these stories. The shells used against the
Boers did not produce anything that could be rightly
described as "frightful carnage." Nevertheless, they
\vere far more effective than a shell loaded with an
old-time explosive would have been, and the British
have no intention of abandoning the use of them.
From recent reports it appears the lyddite shells
used in the Boer war were fired from guns of a com
paratively small caliber, none of them being more
than forty-pounders. Tests made with ioo-pounders
firing at the old battleship Belleisle showed that the
big shells are dangerous to everything in the neigh
borhood unless it be. heavily armored, and further
tests made at Shoeburyness with guns\*of a caliber
between those used in- the South African war and
those used against the Belleisle also demonstrated an
extraordinary explosive force. ,,
EXPERIMENTS WITH LYDDITE.
This week Is the time when the club
women are going to shine, and all of us
who do not belong to one or the other of
the fashionable clubs are pretending we
do. Not to be at the California Club ben
efit at the Orpheum to-morrow is to sound
your own social death knell. Then there
is Wednesday, when the Forum Club Is
going to shine with a swell reception at
its club rooms, with r -i slc and papers and
recitations between the "how-de-dos."
The Forum, I am told. Is rapidly becom
ing th* Intellectual club of this city. -The
members are doing all sorts of brainy
things nnd getting Eastern notices for
them. The Forum, however, has not been
cultivating the head alone and forgetting
tho heart. This club has a delightful plan
for a donation party that is to take place
some time before Thanksgiving. It is to
be an evening reception, and each member
will be allowed invitations for from three
to six friends. Each invited guest is sup
posed 1 to present a package with his or her
. "Nothing much." said his friend. "Only
he is 20 years old, is worth about $50,<XX)
and is a member of the Bohemian Club.
He Is the Owls' baby, and the wise bird
Is overwhelming him with attention.
That's all that'ls the matter with Frank."
Mrs. Gencvleve Goad Martin and her
brother. Frank Goad, will accompany
Mrs. McNutt and her daughters to - the
Philippines. Genevieve Martin and Mamie
McNutt have struck up a very close
friendship during the last year, and it is
the pleasantost thing imaginable that
Mrs. Martin should be' present when
Mamie McNutt gives her hand to Lieu
tenant Potter. Won't the McNutts and
beautiful Genevieve make a stir in bur
new possessions! After -the- wedding Mrs.
McNutt and Ruth -vcill come straight
home, but Mrs.:. Martin, accompanied by
her. brother, will make a. tour of China
and Japan. 4 Everybody is hoping the trip
will -be of benefit to Frank. I saw him the
other day, and although he must tip the
scales at at least ISO rounds his pallor
"and general appearance made me fear for
his health. "What is the matter with
Frank?" I asked a friend of his, just as
his athletic figure, all muffled to the ears,
disappeared around the corner.
Mr. and Mrs. \ Gus Taylor have leased
one of the new houses Just put up on
Gough street between Jackson and Pa
cific and have arranged to settle there
for the next five years. The fact that
the Ta ylors have taken a house is good
news. Mr. Taylor's bride is fluite the, most
frm-loving young woman in this city, and
1 predict that there will be Jolly times
at : the Taylor home. I understand that
the wedding of Georgia Hopkins and -Will
Taylor is not to take, place till next
spring. However, there is to , be plenty
of entertainment a t- the Hopkins home,
Â¦which .was no quiet last winter on account
of the sad illness of Mrs. Hopkins. This
year the Hopkins, girls will have their
bride sister to act as chaperon and all
will be merry again. "

BY SALLY SHARP
SOCIETY: SOME OF ITS PLANS FOR A
JOLLY WINTER.
The care with which the canvass was made and the
thoroughness of it render these reports altogether dif
ferent from the usual campaign predictions. It has
not been a case of claiming everything for the party
nor a case of guesswork. It has been an honest effort
to obtain information in a systematic manner upon a
subject of great importance, and is therefore not a
mere campaign fake but an enterprise of legitimate
journalism.' It has cost much money, time and energy.
It has required the employment of men of high ability
and of well-trained skill in such matters. It is a work
in whose results the public can have confidence, and
all classes of Americans may now rest assured that if
each will but do his duty and vote, the judgment on
election day will put an end to Bryanism and assure
the integrity, honor and prosperity of the republic.
The canvass made by The Call and the New York
Herald was devised solely for the purpose of obtain
ing reliable information concerning the prevailing
public opinion in the doubtful States and the drift
of the sentiment of that class of voters who in the
early stages of the campaign were undecided how they
should vote. The collection of the information was
intrusted to men of impartial minds and of large ex
perience in the study of popular sentiment. Two sets
of men were employed in order that the reports of
che might serve as a check upon any errors in the
reports of the other. One set noted the sentiment of
the voters concerning the rival candidates for the
Presidency and the other the contests in the Con-,
gressional districts. These reports so far from con
flicting, strongly confirm one another. They give
assurance that McKinley will be. re-elected, that Re
publicans will elect a majority of the next House and
that the Senate also will be safe for sound money and
protection. "
BY means .of a canvass carefully made of every
State where the vote in the coming election has
been considered at, all doubtful The Call was
able to present yesterday ample reasons to justify the
expectation that McKinley will be re-elected by a
majority of the electoral college even greater than
that of four years ago, and that not only will pros
perity be assured for another four years but that Bry
anism and all that it implies will be swept from our
politics.
VICTORY FOR. PROSPERITY.
S^ich is the official record of the results of protec
tion and sound money. Can any intelligent citizen
wish to change all that for free trade â and Bryan?-
One further fact is to be noted. In former years
we used to import iron and steel, but now we export
them. In 1880 we imported five times as much in
value as we exported in iron and 'steel products, but
now we export six times the value of our imports of
such goods. . These exports in the past year ag
gregated a value of $121,858,341, thus ranking next
to breadstufTs, cotton and provisions, the three high
est in value. Among iron and steel goods there are
twenty-one classes of. products of which the expor's
were valued at from 'Si, 000,000 to $9,000,000. each.
A notable feature of the report is the showing made
of the extent to which the age of iron is giving way
to the age of steel. The transition is, illustrated by
the substitution, of steel for iron rails in railway con
struction. Here again the United States holds the
primacy, because of her producing almost 40 per cent
of the world's steel output, while Great Britain pro
duces i8j^ per cent and Germany 21 per cent. No
other nation converts so much of its pigiron into
steel as the United States does. â¢ Of the world's pig
iron output, 40,000,000 tons, 70 per cent is made into
steel,' whereas this country converts 77 per cent of
its pigiron tonnage into steel, amounting to 10,636,858
tons, qut of the world's total output of 27,110,000 tons.
The United States is the foremost steel-consuminq
country, of the world, p. single .city having consumed
125,000 tons in a year for building purposes alone; and
one car company having required 400,000 ton? of steel
to meet its yearly contracts. In 1S79 about one-thinl
of our pigiron was' made into rails, but since that date
steel rails have ceased to be 'the chief form of steel
production, their proportion. in 1898 being but one
sixth of the whole. The consumption of steel per
capita 'for non-rail uses in 1879 was 75.4 pounds: in
1889, 213.2 pounds; in 1898, 276.2 pounds, showing
how oAier than rail uses of steel have developed in
twenty years.
in raw materials gives the United States a self-suf
ficing position, as compared with that of her foremost
rivals, Germany and Great Britain.

The basement was used as a storeroom
and as a furniture repair shop; also as the
sleeping room of two Chinese employes,
who according to Captain Comstock of the
flre patrol were lighting themselves to bed
with a coal oil lamp. The supposition. Is
that the lamp was overturned or that it
exploded.
Through windows and doors and up the
light well In the rear, the smoke and
flames found easy passage. An alarm was
rung in from box 41 at 11:08 o'clock. "When
the firemen arrived they found that the
flames had broken through the first floor
behind the staircase on the Jones-street
side. Numerous streams of water were
turned on, and the flre, after a stubborn
fight, was confined to a comparatively
small portion of the lower floor. -The prin
cipal damage was to the furniture, the
building being only slightly damaged. Tho
estimate of the loss varied from $2000 to
$4000. About a dozen roomers on the lorrer
floor had to seek accommodations 'Â¦ In
neighboring houses for the night their
rooms being rendered untenable- by reason
of the water, on the floors.
Bells clanged, and people in all stages of
dress and undress did not stop to consider
the requisites of a toilet in a fashionable
boarding house, as they sought the halls
and other exits. The elevator bell was
rung furiously, but that machine was soon
out of running order, as a sheet of flame
and a dense mass of smoke shot up the
shaft from the basement, where the flre
started. â¢
Guests of the Hotel Sutherland, at the
corner of Butter and Jones streets, had
their expectations of pleasant slumbers
during the night rudely disturbed by an
alarm of fire rung in shortly after 11
o'clock last night. Soon all was in con

female lodgers were scurrying 1 around to
secure all their belongings, or at least as
many as they could conveniently carry, as
the halls began to fill with smoke.

CHURCH YESTERDAY. ABLE ADDRESSES WERE DELIVERED, THE CHOIR SANG BEAUTIFULLY AND
A LETTER FROM THE REV. HORATIO STEBBINS WAS READ.
The Mark Hopkins Institute of Art an
nounces the opening of a photographic
salon In the galleries of the institution on
Thursday, January 17, 190L
"The purpose of this salon," says the
circular of announcement, "is to bring to
gether the best examples of the photo
graphic work.. of the day. possessing the
highest degree of artistic merit and pic
torial interest.
â¢The exhibition will be'glven under the
Joint management of the California Cam
era Club and the Mark Hopkins Institute
of Art, and first and second certificates of
merit will be awarded- In each of the fol
lowing classes: Landscapes, marine,
genre, portraiture, still life, animal
studies, architecture and Interiors.
"In addition to these awards Camera
Craft of San Francisco offers a firet and
eecond medal in each of the different
classes, in accordance with the recom
mendation made by a Jury appointed by
the board of directors of the Ban Fran
cisco Art Association."
An executive committee, consisting of
"W. B. Webster (chairman), A. L.' Coombs
TV". 3. Street. A. G. McFarland, E. G.
Eisen, W. J. Platt. J. "W. Erwln and Rob
ert It Fletcher, is In charge of all ar
rangements, and all needed information
can be obtained by addressing the execu
tive committee of the San Francisco Pho
tographic Salon, Â£19 Market street, San
Francisco.
Says the young artist critic: "The Amer
ican art section at the exposition shows
up wonderfully well. Whistler exhibits
t.iree pictures, all portraits, one of him
eelf, one of Mrs. Whistier. the artist's sis
ter-in-law, and one of a young girl. It Is
Impossible to conceive of anything more
beautiful than the latter one. A small
thins it is, a three-quarter portrait, the
figure leaning against a mantel, the face
reflected in a glass and a spray of azaleas
thrown in for pure joy in the right hand
lower corner. But it is incomparably
above anything modern that 1 have seen
so far, glowing with color, atmosphere
and poetry. It was. however, with the
portrait of himself that Whistler took the
Grand Prix. Marvelously handled is the
latter, but my feeling is that it is too
colorless, almost In monotone, and a little
reminiscent of the well known Nicholson.
X'O^ter sketch of the artist.
"Sargent is another eplendid figure, tre
mendously vigorous and daringly colorful.
He is so magnificently sure of himself.
N'o beating about the bush apparently,
though of course that Is simply the height
of art â the concealment of effort. Neither
Cartlus Duran nor Benjamin Constant
can touch him in the matter of portrait
painting, which is a daring thing to say.
but fully true. 1 think. The picture of
'Romoia,' by Sarah Seers â â¢which was en
graved on wood for the Century's 'Ameri
can Artists Series'â is hung near the
Whistlers, and even in such high com
pany looks excellently well."
The American school of sculpture comes
in only a fair second from the French
school of the day, which is incomparably
above the rest of the world, and which. I
think, will be placed in the future per
haps even with the great Greek period.
There are thiee very great men â Rodin.
Bartholdi ar.d Fremiet. Rodin Is Intensely
human, realistic; Bartholdy is serene but
comber and Fremiet combines grace with
vigor. Our Americans â MacMonnJes, Bart
lett and Barnard â are all conscientious
end fine workmen, but the quality of
greatness is not theirs. Kuhne Beverldge,
a. San Francisco girl, has an amusing re
clining creature, whom she labels a "Ve
nus." and T>ouglas Tllden's "Footballers"
Â«xe here.
From Paris this week come some Inter
esting notes cf the American art section
at the exposition, with so*e distinctly en
couraging comparisons between the
Frtncn and American painters there rep
resented.
Friday the gallery was thrown open to
the public and the pictures will be on
view until Saturday, October 27.
The ICahl collection, or the three repre
sented JCahl, Lodtmann and Kip. is the
moat extensive and possibly the most im
portant, including as it does a couple of
Veroneses, a Rubens, a Wouvermans, \ an
l>yck. Poussin, Ajnton Moro. Leonardo da
Vinci. BeUiniâ in all forty-live old mas
ters of veil-attested genuineness. Other
celebrated names represented m the exhi
bition iire David, j. h. Copley. Greuze,
Van Ruysdael. Andre Van Loo. Corot,
2i<.-ij;ljra.jiÂ«ii. Bartolommeo and Pen.nl.
As to tho Lodtmann collection of old
portraits COQSUUns of a small ancestral
gallery of twenty bishops, Burgomeisters.
i>rofctsors and tht-ir aristocratic wives
and daugbiers, a peculiar interest at
taches. to these. The story of the collec
tion is quite a small romance; how they
were brought to California some ten or
fifteen years ago by one of the Lodt
maims; how they were willed to the last
dtpcendant of the family, Mrs. Lodtmsuiu,
a iaundress. llvtng in Alameda, two or
three yÂ»ars ago, and stored by her in an
outhouse in r'ruitvale; how they were
tbt^re discovered in a sadly battered and
forlornly grimy condition oy an employe
of thÂ»? Art Association and by him clean
ed, restored and brought to the attention
of the authorities of the institution, and
how th'.E collection, uameiess. save tor
one example, "Koerner," has set the con
noisseurs guessing as to their authorship.
The catalogue of the collection has this
to say as to the family history of the pic
tures: â¢ Â¦
"The Loctmanrs are an ancient family
of Wtr-stphaiia. Ocrmany, tracing their an
cestry back to the ninth century. These
pictures formed part of a collection in the
castle of Steinbruck. at one time the fam
ilv seat, and were brought to California
h\- a. desotiidant some ten or tifteen years
ago. The balance ol the cohectioji is in
the Museum of Osnabruck. With the ex
ception of No. 246. which is by Koernetf,
the artists are unknown. In many cases
the paintings appear to have been cut
down as ;^- wore away the margins, and
H) the artist's name may have disappear
ed. Many of thtm are of considerable
merit, some few are evidently by men of
feeraus and all are cf interest."
Of Quite exceptional Interest Is the loan
exhibition of old paintines of the six
teenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centu
ries now on view at the Mark Hopkins
Institute of Art. The exhibition opened
on Thursday evening with a. reception to
members, and a large number of associ
ates of the institution enjoyed the privi
lege of a private view of thi3 noteworthy
collection-

The holy sacrament of confirmation, waa
administered yesterday afternoon at St.
Patrick's Church by his Grace Archbishop
Riordan to a class of over three hundred
boys and girls. The ceremony was one of
the most Impressive of its kind ever held
in this city. Rev. Father Cummlngs, pas
tor of the parish, made it a service that
will ever live in the memories of the little
oneÂ» that knelt at the* altar and. were
anointed by the Archbishop.
The service commenced at 4 ' clock, bat
long: before the .hour the sacrea edifice
was crowded to the doors by friends of
the ' children, .who devoutly remained tin
the close of the confirmation. At the open
ing processional' the Archbishop entered
the sanctuary. Immediately investing
himself with' a white cope and miter and
receiving his crozler from the, hands of
Rev. Father Mulligan he descended the
steps from Â»the higa altar and waited for
the children . to kneel before him. The
boys advanced to one side of the commu-,
nion-railand the girls to the other. Eu
gene Lacy stood as sponsor for the boys
and Miss McDermott acted in the same
capacity for the girls. As the last child
returned to his seat his Orace ascended
the pulpit and said in part:
"My dear people and children, this is a
day that should ever be carried Un your
memory. Remember that to-day you have
received a most solemn sacrament and
that you are now enlisted as soldiers of
God. To the parents especially would I
address a few words. iAre you aware of
the great responsibility that is on your
shoulders? You must see that the chil
dren grow to be men and women with the
love of God in their hearts. The most
important duty of both priest and others
outside the church is to see to uie prcper
training of children. Â¦ Christ said those
beautiful words, 'Suffer little children to
come unto Me.' So you see, my people,
that the responsibility rests with you.
These little ones belong to God and it
would be a terrible thing for you in your
last days to feel that you had not raised
them in the proper manner.

firmed: ;

with Bohe runner up. Bohe -was s a - fa

past for the first five points. Bohe was
placed for two and the, winner scored an
other, as the hare escaped., Fiery Face
did good work and looked a winner, but
lost a short course to Narcissus.
. Red Angus did great work for a young
ster In the big stake. He was a favorite
against Rude Awakening, but in a long

Union Park never held so large a crowd
nor furnished a greater card of coursing
than that of yesterday. Standing room
was at a premium to the extent that me
iron pipes which were erected for. awn
ing supports In anticipation ' of rain were
taken down to give. the vast assemblage
more room. The veteran John Grace, pre
mier judge of America, was at his best
and the slipping of James Grace could not
be equaled. The idea of having the big
stake run off at this season originated
wlth'J. H. Rosseter and. under his direc
tion the affair was brought to a success
ful conclusion;
Up went the red flag, announcing the
fact that the stake favorite Beacon would
have to be content with second place in
the great coursing event, and cheer after
cheer showed that -the victory of Sacra
mento Boy was a popular one. Time; 1:43.
Too much credit cannot be given to the
winner of the great event. He was led
by his opponent in every course, but it
must be admitted he is a game and clever
greyhound. In the rundown on Saturday
he showed he 'was willing to stay, awhile
and went a hard route against Sir Pasha.
The latter just led to the turn and when
once in the Boy proved he was the better
dog at all points. This course went' over
the limit and many found excuses to play
away from yesterday's winner on that ac
count. Whenever he got on the game yes
terday he managed to run up a bunch of
points, and even fast Palo Alto failed to
score when the Boy commenced to work.
While the does were at their closest
work the threatening fog lifted from the
lower end of the held an'd the immense
throng of spectators gained a splendid
view of the rapid exchanges.
It was here that the excitement took a
strong hold and the cheers of the crowd
could be heard a mile away. When Sac
ramento Boy showed to advantage and
kept up his great work even those who
were not financially interested in the re
sult lost all control and urged him on..
Then down past the grand stand went the
two great coursers with the up-river dog
in the lead, working in and out close up.
Suddenly, with a cuick movement, the
Boy snapped up the hare, tripping it for
Beacon to kill, leaving the score 21 to 15
in favor of Sacramento Boy.
Beacon, the great blue dog, whose speed
no one can question, was more than a
little lucky in getting easy" hares and
short courses in the early rounds. of the
stake. When the dogs went to the slips
for the all-important deciding course Cur
tis' fast one was a 5 to 2 favorite. Slipper
James ' ( Grace sent them away after a
strong hare. The blue dog shot to the
front and did the better part of the Bcor
ing at first. Once in, however, Sacramen
to Boy showed all kinds of cleverness and
kept the hare within a few short inches,
working on the game bo closely that he
kept his speedy opponent from nearing
the long-eared representative from Mer
ced plains. The favorite, however, finally
nosed in and made several good points.

THE great event In American

baseman played in the box, without as
much as allowing a Dude to maltreat any

did Devereaux repeat hi* good work. In

Five bits ard three runs were what
clinched the victory for Oakland. -
The Senators were unable to fasten the

OAKLAND.
Too much dog worked upon Dr. Mos
klman's nerves, and in one, two, three
order the bags were overstocked with
statesmen â Doyle on third, McLaughlin
on second and Hanloa en first. It was
then up to Hughes to do something with
the stick. He did it. The ball cut a
etrealc between left field and center, los
ing Its onward movement when It butted
into the flag pole. A general Senatorial
bag-clearance sale was in order, Hughes
quitting his fast leg-work when thr^e
lourths of the journey was completed. To
make the score an even matter Hughes
crossed the rubber when Stultz hit to
ripht.
The dojr and Hughes' three-bagger won
the game lor the Senators, but Hughes
was not the only "three-baggerer" on the
EroundF. In the first inning Francks did
as much, but he couM rot even score
himself. He died at the plate when Held
rolled an infield ball to short.
It was the seventh Inning that put Oak
land on the board. Moskiman took the
first station en a hit, advanced one on a
parsed ball and scored on Pete Lohnian's
double. Lohnan perished later on at the
plate.
The crowd said the parse was slow and
would not cheer up. Down in the "beer
cage" a rooter charged the Dudos with
being anarchists. This nearly provoked
Â« riot, until the fanatic explained himself.
He eaid they were such "bum throwerp."
ppace and harmony were soon restored.
the Oakland fan having freed his mind
of certain wise paws on ancient, hair
covered jokes. This was movement num
ber two In the game.
Doyle was too intricate for the Dudes,
so they lost. Moskiman, after the bad
second Inning, showed his best evolutions.
The score:
j^b FOX terrier with a hoodoo black
J I epot on its nose defeated the
sL^mA Dudes yesterday at Recreation
B 1 grounds. This happened in the
V second inrJr.g. when the Sena
torial fanatics let loose a piece of active
Cog flesh on the diamond. They wanted
to show the Brummels that a dog could
display a certain quantum of life and
activity and give the people a run for
their money. It took six Dudes and Jim
McDonald to catch the terrier, whoso
bag-chasing- career was brought to an
end by Held. Then the game went on,
and this is what happenedâ enough to flx
the. result of the game, a victory for the
Senators. The score was < to L

HATWARDS, Oct. 2X-â Edward Clark,
a well-known young man of this city, af
ter visiting his mother's grave last night
was suddenly seized with a suicidal and
homicidal mania. He cut his own throat
from ear to ear and then attacked a bar
ber and the customer whom the barber
was in the act of shaving. . Only the fact
that he was too weak from the loss of
blood to carry out his designs prevented a
horrible tragedy. He was finally disarmed
and Is now under the care of a doctor.
He is likely to die.
â¢ The murderous outbreak occurred in tho
barber shop of Joseph Marshall laÂ«t even
ing. Manuel Flores was in the barber's
chair being shaved by John Silva. when
Clark rushed into the shop. He picked
up a razor and announced his intention
of cutting his throat. Sllva saw that
Clark was insane and began talking to
him gently, telling him that the razor
that he had picked up was a dull one
and would not do the 'Â¦ work and if he
really wanted to cut his throat he should
take a better instrument. Meanwhile he
was putting all the other razors out of
sight as rapidly as possible. Sllva finally
got the razor away from him and Clark
went out.
The Insane man went to a nearby saloon
and wrote, a note .'.to Deputy , Coroner
Geary, in which he. said he was going to
die and -saying he wanted his brother to
have all of his property.
This did not take long and Clark re
turned to the barber shop, rurhed to one
of the stands and, seizing- a razor
slashed himself across the throat with
out giving the barber an opportunity to
take the weapon away from him.
With the blood streaming from a horri
ble wound Clark made a rush at Silva
announcing that he was going to commit
murder as well as eulcl-'.<-. Sllva dorigcci
around a chair and managed to rnako iilj
escape Into the street. . â¢ /
Meanwhile the position of Manuel Flores
in the chair, with toweling about his neck
and lather on his face, waa not the most
comfortable in the world. Claikha.l^ not
paid any attention to Flores until Sllva
made his escape, when, he turned to gee
who else there might. be upon whom he
could satisfy his murderous desira. >
As he passed the chair In which Flores
was sitting. the latter made a Jump for
him. The very fact that Flores came
from such an unexpected position dazed
Clark. Flores seized the arm that hold
the razor and twisted it so that the
weapon fell from his grasp. Clark had al
ready been weakened by loss of blood, or
Flores would hardly have been able to
overcome him.
It was found that Clark was bleeding
to death, and the crowd that gathered
took him to Dr. Dean's office, where hi3
wounds were dressed. It was found that
he had made a ragged gash from one ear
to the other, but had miraculously escaped
cutting any of the arteries. He was later
taken to his home, where he is hovering
between life and death. ~v
Clark is 26 years of age. A short time
ago his mother died, leaving him a house
and considerable money. Up to the time
of her death be had been a sober and in
dustrious young man. but when she passed
away he told everybody that the only
friend that he had in the world was pone,
and he began drinking heavily. 1 lo kept
this drinking up to such an extent that a
few days ago his father ordered htm away
from home. He left, and took up hÂ«3 resi
dence in the house that had been left him
by his mother. He continued his carous
ing and went from bad to worse, until his
brain gave way under the strain yester
day." Â¦ ';â¢' 'Â¦ ':â¢. Â¦ Â¦ , : Â¦ ; . : : " .;
During Saturday afternoon he told sev
eral friends that he had no friend In the
world since - his mothers death and that
he was going to kill himself on her grave.
In the eveninpr. Just before the attack in
the barber shop, Clark visited his moth
er's grave in the cemetery. But he, failed
to provide himself wUh anything for car
rying out his threat, bo he was compelled
to return to Hay wards, where he nearly
Bucceedeil In accompl'.^hlng his purpose.

HOUSES NEARLY INCTNEBATED.
Three score or more horses In the Occi
dent stable, owned by Lloyd & Brooks,
at the corner of Geary and Polk streets,
narrowly escaped incineration In a fire
that started in the basement, where the
stalls are located, at about 1 o'clock this
morning. Policeman "Walters saw smoke
pouring through a' grating In the side
walk, and turnesd In an alarm. He then
aroused the Bleeping stablemen, and the
work of getting the terrified animals out
of the burning building was begun.
As there was no place in the neighbor
hood where they could be cared for. the
horses were turned loose as soon as they
reached the street, the rescuers beinir
obliged to hurry back for more. Several
horses were badly scorched and a number
nearly smothered by the smoke, but no
deaths resulted.
The Fire Department extinguished the
fire before- the bulldinsr had been serious

the Elizabeth Walters estate.

UPHOLDS CAPTAIN EWING.
Pastor Defends and Warmly Praise3
His Memory.
Rev. S. D. Hutsir.piller. pastor of the
Central Methodist Episcopal Church,
spoke at the service last night of Captain
Elmore E. Ewing, the member of his con
gregation who committed suicide Friday
night. He spoke with Intense feeling, and
the breathless silence of his auditors
showed how deeplv the tragedy had
touched them. The pastor said:
"Captain Ewir.g was a man who in the
church had the love, confidence and re
spect of ever}' one. and who. though lying
mute and helpless under whatever criti
cism may be offered now. still has the
fullest love and confidence of every one
who knew him In this church.
"That noble form the victim of disease,
and, as I believe before God. of Insanity,
the result of disease â that form shall lie
to-morrow under a wreath, the token of
the esteem of his official associates In the
church.
"To me tho burden of sadness of It all
Is not that the poor, tired man is aslee;>â
the burden is that the wife and daughter
will be smitten not alone by the news of
his death, but in the dispatches sent out
over the country and for which, so far as
the facts have been revealed, there Is no
foundation.
"The official board met this morning
and passed strong resolutions, every one
believing that no act of Captain Ewing's
life performed under normal mentality
could be subject to the reproach of an
gels or men. No man ever heard hi3 lips
opened in malice or In words derogatory
to a eingle human being."
KENNEY THINKS HIGQINS

From Undertaker Just Before
Disappearing.
Johnnie Kenney, the Salmon alley poli

be mentioned In connection with the dis
appearance of William Higgins. his
brother-in-law. Last night he visited po
lice headquarters and announced nis
willingness to do all in his power to un
ravel the mystery surrounding the dis
appearance of Hlggtns.
Kenney says the last time he saw.Hlg
glns was 9 o'clock last Friday night In
the room where Kenney's sister lay dead.
Higgins went out, saying he was going
to buy a pair of black gloves. Kenney
says he has learned that his brother-in
law borrowed $100 from the undertaker
who burled the remains of Mrs. Higgins,
Â«aving he would repay It from the estate
left by the dead woman. Kenney thinks
Higgins has gone to New York. Last
December, the politician says. Higgins
sold a valuable diamond ring belonging
to him and took a trip East on the pro

The big vaudeville matinee to come off
to-morrow at the Orpheum is an appeal
to the philanthropic to contribute money
to an established and most worthy fund.
The ladies of the California Club' may
well challenge a comparison of the pro

ing vaudeville aggregation. In a single

This is surely a bewildering array and

more than their money's worth of en

Joy the consciousness of doing good.
There were some fine vocal "numbers on
the programme presented by the Arion

FORNIA CLUB BENEFIT.
j :
THE California's "standing room
only" sign was out early last even
ing, when the William H. West
minstrels opened their week's en-
g-ajrement at the big theater.
It was not only a welcome to these? fa
vorite minstrels, but a greeting fo a
former San Franciscan, William Hi Hal
lett, and the former San Franciscan must
be indeed difficult to please If the royal
welcome accorded him by his former asso
ciates, the Bay CUy Wheelmen, Olympic
Clubmen and the members of the Corin
thian Tacht Club, did not gratify to the
utmost any desire in that 'line .which
might be his. Three appropriate and beau
tiful floral emblems were presented to
Mr. Hallett after his solo. "Tell Me,"
which was admirably sung, and questions
pertinent and impertinent greeted his en
trance upon the stage, with club cries -ga
lore and "hurrahs" in plenty.
There was a slight, becoming nervous
ness evident in Mr. Hallett's work as in
terlocutor, which important post he occu
pied before Mr. West's appearance In the
chair, but ' otherwise the position was
gracefully and effectively- maintained.
All the old favorites are to the fore this
time; Billy Van. with his comic fancies
and pleasant voice: the ballad-singing
Richard J. Jose, of Falstafflan build and
cherubic voice; Ernest Tenney. clever
coon: the deep- voiced John P. Radsrers,
Manuel Romaan. Charles Whalen, Ray
mond Teal and the rest. For the humor
o' it. the Jokes are of the usual unaston
ishlng order, but the manner of their de
liver}' Is piquant and fresh.

"For Her Sake," commencing: Sunday aft
ernoon, will be the bill at this house.

BERKELET. Oct. 21- â The South
Berkeley Presbyterian Church was dedi
cated this afternoon practically free from
debt. When the services were opÂ«ned the
trustees were under an obligation of $330.
but before Rev. James Curry dedicated
the church he raised Â«300 among the au
dience by a few minutes of enthusiastic
work. Thus unexpectedly the church waÂ»
practically freed from debt.
Rev. E. C. Clark of Elmhurst opened
the services by Bible reading. Miss Pearl
Thomas rendered a vocal solo and the
prayer was offered by Rev. James 3.
Macdonald. The dedicatory sermon wa4
preached by Rev. Hugh T. Dobbins of Co
lusa, son of the pastor of the church.
Rev. H. H. Dobbins. I>.D. As his text Mr.
Dobbins spoke from Chronicles I. 19 and
22: "Now set. your souls to seeK God,"
and "This Is the house of tne Lord God."
"You have built this church." he said,
"but it Is not yours; :t belongs to God.
Henceforth It Is the property of no man
and of no association, but it is God'd
property. You are in possession of it only
under certain limitations. You merely
hold it as stewards to use for those thing;*
which will advance the interests oi God."*
Rev. Dr. H. II. Dobbins, the pastor of
the church, told the story of the bulldln?
of the church; how money and labor and
material were given freely by generous
people until the church grew up whero
It stood. It 'cost all complete *1153 15. Of
this sum $350 remained unpaid.
When Rev. James Curry of TemescaJ
arose to read the ritual he said he would
raise some morft money for tr.e church.
In the style of an auctioneer he bid one
side of the house against .he other until
$30) was raised.
The church Is a 1 very real and pretty
building-. The lot and street work hav3
all been raid for and the paster and con
pregation feel justly proud of their work.
Material, Money and Labor for the
Building Are All Donated by
. Generous Parishioners

Concerning the batteries cf battleships

Tfc* decision finally cctne to in the arrange

they have been subjected have demonstrated

the ccrr.rscn.enent of the discussion that there

w.th the two vessels recently completed tending

CHICAGO. Oct. 21.â "Word was received
here to-<3ay of the arrival In Paris of thÂ»
youn# American explorer and engineer,
William Stamps Cherry of Chicago. HÂ«
comes direct from the Coniro FreÂ« State.
Since Mr. Cherry left Chicago nearly four
years ago on his second trip ho has vis-.
Ited a considerable portion of thÂ» un
known lands In the Congo Free State and
the country north of the Congo, Including
the Kittu region. Mr. Cherry brinss back
considerable data which will be of im
mense historic and scientific interest.
When England and France nearly went
to war over the Fashoda affair. Major
Marchand. It will be remembered, had
taken possession of that portion of tha
country on the Nile as an outlet on tha:
.â¢river for the French possessions. Mr.
Cherry at that time was the leader of a
second expedition organized In the French
Conjro which followed closely the one led
by Marchand. Mr. Cherry on this trip
took with him besides supplies for tha
French a steel river steamer In section*
and upon his arrival on the banks of the
Nile supervised the steamer's reconstruc
tion. This boat played an Important part
in that International episode, as tha In
tention of France was to'tise the steamer
In establishing French domination over
the lands bordering on the Nile. On his
return to the Conero country from Fasho
da. Mr. Cherry devoted a portion of his
time to the exploration or the hitherto
unknown Klttu region, lyln^r to the north
of the Conpo Free State and the- French
Congo country. The Klttn reerion is far
removed from the portion of Central Af
rica with which Henry M. Stanley rnade
the world so familiar.
It Is expected that Mr. Cherry will brias
back considerable Information of the so
cial life and Industries of a people never
before visited by a white man. Ths younj
Chlcrujoan also traveled over equatorial
Africa, to correct any misleading Informa
tion about that country. He has taken a
series of photographs of the various Af
rican tribes and also added largely to tha
collection of curioa secured on his first
trip.
Mr. Cherry was accompanied on h!s lat
est trip by Charles H. McCllntock of Chi
cago. About a year after their arrival In
the French Consro State Mr. McClintock
succumbed to African fever. Mr. Cherry
then continued the trip alone.

Recent Bains Send the Tubers Into
Port on the Bush.
For weeks past the ranchers along the
Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers have
been gathering up their potatoes and
waiting for a rise In the market. Thou
sands and tens of thousands ot sacks
have lined the banks of the various
sloyghs for months past, but not a man
wanted to ship. He expected a big ad
vanct In prices, and was holding on.
Then came the rain, and all hands de
cided it was time to ship. For a week
past there has been an average arrival
of 6000 sacks of potatoes a day at Jack
son and Washington street wharves, and
the market is glutted. The Chief Wharf
inger is now having some fun getting the
spuds moved uptown.
Bush Orders on Transports.
The transport Sherman will sail away
for Manila this week, and the Sheridan
will be made ready to sail on November
1. Originally it was intended to send
the Sherman away on the 1st and the
Sheridan on November 16, but circum
stances have arisen. which make a rush
order necessary, and both vessels will
leave ahead of time. The chances are
that both the Sherman and Sheridan will
call at China with supplies.

POTATO MARKET GLUTTED.
THE American vessels Aryan and
Shenandoah are both playing In
hard luck. They had a difficult
time of It in reaching port, and
both had to put to sea again
when all seemed fair for a run across the
bar.
The. Aryan is now ready to dock t but
It may be several days before the Shen
andoah comes alongside. The Aryan, In
spite of her hard-luck journey, is ready
for the underwriters, but the Shenan
doah has to be overhauled. She was afoul
of the British ship Crompton on Saturday
night, and both vessels were slightly
damaged.
On the night of August 21, when the
Shenandoah was in latitude 33.51 south.
longiture.164 east, Captain Harvey, while
under mental derangement, disappeared
unknown to any one. He was never seen
afterward, and It is supposed he commit
ted suicide by Jumping overboard. A
strong west wind was blowing and heavy
sea running.
The ship was brought to port by Chief
Officer Taylor.
Captain "Jim" Murphy of the Arthur
Sewall is on his way here' to take conv
mand of the vessel. In the old days the
Shenandoah was the "crack" of the Se
wall fleet, and Captain Murphy was the
"crack" master. Since he left her the
vessel has not done so well, and he is now
hurrying to San. Francisco to once more
take command of the finest wooden ship
afloat.
As long as the Shenandoah and Aryan
last they will serve as samples of what
Uncle Sam could do in the way of ship
building- when wooden vessels held sway.
The collision between the Shenandoah
and Crompton did not amount to much.
The two vessels came together during a
lull in the breeze, but neither was seri
ously damaged.

The Leonie is a total loss. She was con
sidered one of the best boats on the bay.
A score of boatmen who had hovered
near the scene, afraid to render aid until
after the Leonie sank, now hurried to the
rescue. Smith, who was suffering agonies
from his burns and cuta, was carried to a
near-by drug store for treatment. Bellof
and Stuparich were given a change of
clothing and the victims of the accident
returned to the city on a late boat/
A second explosion, that of the tank
over which Bellof a few seconds before
had been standing, rent the Leonie from
stem to stern. For an instant the flames
flared out over the water and then were
quenched as the ill-fated launch turned
turtle and plunged to the bottom.
Again Smith shouted for â¢Stuparich, and
then sighting him threw him an oar.
Stuparich grasped the improvised life pre
server and was drawn alongside the boat.
Bellof. who was uninjured, sighted the
boat, swam up and dragged himself in.
Thinking that Stuparich was In the boat.
Smith and Bellof rowed for the shore
and reached the beach before they found
that their guest was clinging to the gun
wale, too weak to aid himself.
crawled to the rear of the launch, sprang
into a "trailer" and cut away.
"Where is Stuparich?" he shouted.
Saturday afternoon Mr. Stuparich. who
Is superintendent of the Stuparich Manu
facturing Company, 141 Fremont street,
was invited to join Bellof and Smith in
a hunting expedition. Bellof, who resides
at 2105^ Stockton street and who is also
connected with the Stuparich Manufac
turing Company, made the arrangements
for the trip. The launch was stocked
with provisions and Mr. Stuparich took
an early boat -from this city to see that
everything was ship shape. Smith, who
is employed by the Dickman-Jones Com
pany, joined Belldf late In the afternoon
and they went to Sausalito. Shortly after
7 o'clock Bellof and Smith went out to the
launch to fill the gasoline tank, which
holds, or held, twenty-five gallons. Stu
parich remained at Barron Gatoldi's to
change his clothing and prepare his guns.
This done he went down to the beach, se
cured a boat and rowed out to the launch.
Before Stuparich reached the launch the
'work of filling the gasoline tank had been
completed. Bellof was standing on the
bow of the little vessel and Smith was
just entering the engine room with a lan
tern.
explosion and the wreck of the Leonle
settled into the sea, while her startled
and injured occupants struggled for life
being fitted with double engines and all
modern improvements, having been com
pleted but two months ago. She cost her
owners $1800 without her furnishings. In
addition to uie loss of the boat, Bellof and
Smith lost their guns, clothing and sport-
Ing outfits. Stuparich was more fortu
nate, having kept his sruns and equipment
ashore, Intending to take them only when
all was ready for the start.
The cause of the blowing up of the
Leonie is a mystery. It is whispered
among the friends of the owners who re
side in Sausalito, however, that both Bell
of and Smith suspect the loss of their
vessel was the result of some enemy's
malice. Jealousy among 'boat owners Is
common, they say, and hence they believe
that some one, anxious that the Leonie
should no longer ply the main, went
aboard her at night and opened the en
gine valves. When the gasoline was pour
ed into the tanks it ran Into the engine
room and the presence of the lantern
consummated the scheme planned for her
destruction.
Smith's fortitude and successful effort
to save his companions, after having been
so terribly injured, have won for him the
praise of all his friends, and those he
saved will not be the first to forget his
heroism.

Mamie Corrigtm Threatened Suicide.
There is a growing suspicion that tho
girl, Mamie Corrigan, who left* her
father's house, 207 Steiner street, Wednes
day night, has carried out her threat and
committed suicide. The girl's parents and
Detectives Coleman and McMurray have
called at every house where she was
known, but not the slightest trace of her
has been found. Yesterday as a last resort
they went to Berkeley, but without any
result. The girl had written a letter to
her lover, Joseph TVelnholz, which fell
into the hands of Weinholz's mother. r?he
took the letter to Mrs. Corrlgan Wednes
day night and the girl and her mother had
a quarrel about the letter. The girl

That the bonea of her owners,

those of their erstwhile guest, Stefano J.
Stuparich. are not mingled among hers
beneath the waves was due to fate alone.
The disaster occurred Saturday evening
shortly before S o'clock. The flame of a

and face by the heat of the explosion and
his flesh cut from his waist to his ankles
by the broken glass, his clothing torn to
ribbons, but still awake to his danger,
As Smith reached the engine room the
odor of escaping gas attracted his atten
tion, but before he could retreat the little
craft blew up. Smith was hurled head
long through the glass window opening
out on to the side deck. Stuparich was
lifted from the row boat and tossed twen
ty feet astern, but he did not lose con
sciousness. Bellof leaped out Into the
night-darkened waters at the first flash,
and just In time. .
"Thinking he was only fooling. I re
mained in the saloon, and was in the ]
act of dijnking a glass of beer when he
Fuddenly returned and drawing a revolver
opened lire on me. As I staggered back
he replaced the weapon in his pocket,
evidently thinking that he had fatally
wounded me, and hurriedly left the
place."
"Noticing that he was offended." re- j
marked the wounded man. "I started to j
apologize to him. when he suddenly left
the saloon, after threatening to return
and do me up.
A few minutes later Mathyas rushed in
to the saloon and finding his unsuspecting
victim standing against the bar imme
cuately drew a. SS-caliber revolver and
fired at him. The bullet struck Her
_og in the thigh, inflctlng a serious.
wound. After firing the shot Mathyas
coolly placed the smoking revolver In his
pocket and left the saloon. He was fol
lowed by several men who had witnessed
the shooting, but as he threatened to turn
the revolver on them they gave up the
pursuit.
Herzog was taken to the office of Dr.
H. C. Edwards at 955 Folsom street,
where the wound was dressed. He ex-Â«
plained that he was only joking when he
pulled Mathyas' whiskers.
During a trivial row in s. saloon at 219 j
Fourth street last evening Herman Her- j
zog, a young man, was shot through the j
right thigh by Frederick Mathyas, an as
eayer employed in the Mining Bureau.
Mathyas fled from the scene immediately
after the shooting and up to a late hour j
last nijrht had not been captured.
According to the eye-witnesses of the
shooting. Herzog and Mathyas were in
the 6aloon drinking, when the former joc
ularly pulled the latter's whiskers.
Mathyas became greatly incensed and af- :
ter roundly abusing Herzog for what he j
termed his impudence left the place,
threatening to return and shoot the man j
who had insulted him. j
Nothing waa thought of the threat at
the time, as it was not believed that j
_lat_yas would return. Â«

SHOOTS A MAN

Becomes, Despondent Because of a
Chiding, but Now She Is Glad
Her Attempt'at Suicide
Miss Nellie Newton, a 17-year-old girl
residing: with her aunt at 226 Third
street, brooded over being chided for a
trivial disobedience until she decided that
life was not worth living, and sought
death and oblivion beneath the murky
.waters of the bay. The despondent girl
jumped from the Folsom-street wharf at
5 o'clock yesterday morning, but a sailor
plunging from the high deck of the
transport Sherman rescued her from the
fate she courted, and now she is glad she
is alive and promises never to do it
again.
The girl's mother isT in the East and
she has made her home with her aunt,
Mrs, H. Ash, since early childhood. Mrs.
Ash is the proprietress of a lodging
house at the Third-street address and
brought the first cloud on the life of her
young niece when she, required her to
assist in performing the duties of the
household. .Miss Newton became discon
tented and moody and at last when her
aunt requested her to bring in some
furnituro from the back porch she re
belled. As a result the furniture was
drenched by J the recent rain and Mra.
Ash scolded her niece for her negligence
or willfulness.
That was the last straw. On
Saturday night after the other oc
cupants of the lodging-house were
asleep the girl crept downstairs and out
into the night. She was determined to
die, but her courage waned, until shortly
before daylight, tired from tramping the
streets all night, she found herself at the
foot of Folsom street.
She walked out to the end of the wharf
and after a few moments' hesitation
tnrew herself into the water. The act
was witnessed by, several sailors jpn the
transport, and one of them, quickly di
vesting himself of his coat, dove after
n%r. He brought the girl to the surface
and managed to keep her above water j
until assistance arrived, when she was
drawn up on to the wharf. She was un
conscious,**but soon revived and was sent
home.
Miss Newton attended the theater with
her aunt last night and appeared to be
in. high spirits. She was loth to talk
about her attempt at self-destruction,
but admitted that she had been foolish
and had no desire to repeat the attempt.
The chilly, early morning at least served
to drown her troubles for the time being,
and she believes life is worth living
after all, in token of which she went to I
the theater last night with her aunt. {
