ings in the case of Captain McCalla ts a
court of inquiry and not a court-martial.
The Navy Department was advised some
time ago that trouble had arisen between
Captain McCalla. commanding the New
ark, and Lieutenant Commander John C.
Colwell, formerly naval attache at Lon
don, and now executive officer of the ship.
While the department was acquainted
with the facts, it left the matter to the
eomniander-In-chief of the station. Ad
miral Remey, to adjust. He has now
found It necessary to appoint a court of
inquiry, which will determine the merits
of the dispute between the two officers.
Should this tribunal recommend- a court
martial in the case of Captain McCalla.
it would be necessary to relieve him from
his command nnd order him to the United
States, for there are. not a sufficient num
ber of officers of the requisite rank on the
Asiatic station to form a court-martial
for the caDtalo.

under arrest and begged the privilege of
communicating with her attorney before
being taken at that ijnseemly hour ana
under such distressing conditions to the
City Prison. *
The request was granted and within a
few minutes Mrs. Lund's attorney was at
the Franklin Hotel and In consultation
with her. The attorney sought out Pollco
Judge Cabanlss and Induced hlra to accept
cash ball of $100. The acceptance of this
ball by Judge Cabanls?. under these clr
cumstanco!>. was c.'early In. violation of
the charter provision. Judge Cabanlss
has erred !n\the same way before and hai
created considerable scandal In his de
partment by so doing. He had. however,
saved Mrs. Lund from the humiliation of
being taken to the prison. She was forced
to go Into court yesterday, and although
her attorney begj?Â«d for an Immediate
hearing of the charge' against her. thÂ«
case was postponed until Friday after
noon.
In the meantime her husband had died
a suit which is without precedent In the
history of the courts ' of California.
Through his attorneys. Sullivan & Sulli
van, he filed in the Superior Court a suit
asking that the deed of gift for the Web
ster-street home to his wife be revoked
on the ground that It was obtained under
false pretenses. In this suit the husband
makes the claim that the consideration
was the conjugal truth of his wife, which
he alleges the wife did not give. Furth
er than this, eliminating the scandalous
features of the document, tho husband
alleges that the wife owes her downfall
to Harry Herz.
Â¦ In this condition the disagreeable ar
faiz rests, but the fight between husband
an.l wife will be pursued bitterly to Its
end. The wife declared yesterday that
the husband has resorted to his desperate
measures in order to force her to return
to him. The husband, through his at
torneys, replies that he haa discovered
enough to prove that his wife and Harry
Herz deliberately conspired to rob hjm
and not succeeding in that have now sued
him for divorce in order to obtain his
prcperty. vj
The attorneys for 'the husband have re
ceived the reports of' the private detec
tives. who t pretend to have followed Mrs.
Lund in**every, movement day and night
since /she left "her Webster-street home.
Last Thursday one of these private de
tectives swore to a complaint against
Mrs. Lund before Police Judge .Cabanlss.
This complaint was not served upon the
woman until 5 o'clock Sunday morning,
when she was alone in her apartments at
the Franklin Hotel and Police Sergeant
Donovan and Private Detective J. J. But
ler banged, on her door. She was ordered
to set ' ud and did ao. Sha was Dlaced
The husband at once began a flsht
against his wife's suit. He employed
three detectives, a man and two women,
to shadow his wife In every movement. It
Is upon the alleged . discoveries Â«)f these
ptivt.te detectives that the charge s<ainst
Mrs. Lund was made and the suit to
recover the Webster-street home was
filed yesterday. Mrs. Lund left her home
on "Webster street and took up her resi
dence at the Franklin Hotel on> Market
street, registering under the name of Mrs.
Jerome, which In the criminal charge
against her Is designated as an alias.
Thejprlvate detectives also took "residence
at the same hotel. What followed after
that will be included iri*the contradictory,
scandalous and unwelcome testimony of
witnesses in the divorce court, the civil
court and before the bar of a police judge.
The wife left her husband at the Va-
Itncla-street station and went^immedi
ate'y to her attorney, Joseph ltothchild.
and commanded him to bring ;.-,u \t against
her husband on the ground of. extreme cru
elty. The suit was instituted on the fol
lowing day and the wife rtspresentel a
very serious condition ot affairs In the
Lund household, j She alleged that her
aged spouse threw cups of boiling water
at her, and when she dodged them fired
â¢nates at her. She declared that lifer with
him was unbearable and she demanded
a thousand dollars a month alimony and
a division of property rights.
They finally came to San Francisco and
Lurd built a magnificent home for him
self and wife at 2716 Webster street.
About a year ago he deeded this home
to her, as he stated in a complaint which
he filed yesterday. In "consideration that
during his life she be a pure, chaste nnd

asserts that he has been forced to the

MR.<A"ttD MRS. WILLIAM C. LUND, WHOSE MARITAL CAREER OF FOUR YEARS HAS BROUGHT THEM TO
SHOALS OF THE DIVORCE COURT, THE CIVIL TRIBUNAL AND THE BAR OF A POLICE JUDGE IN
' THIS CITY.
SUPERIOR JUDGE HEBBARD.
WHO ENJOINS THE CIVIL
SERVICE COMMISSION.
WILLIAM C. LUND, a mil
lionaire, whose marital Infeli
cities have been the theme of
private sosslp and public
Bcandal, has created a prece
dent for aged husbands in the chastise
ment of their wives. He has had hU
young wife before the bar of a local Po
lice Court charged with the only offense
which dishonors a wife in the eyes of the
world. In language more forcible than
delicate, he swears that he exacted from
her a promise to be puie, chaste and vir
tuous and he haa discovered proof that
she is false, untrue, unchaste, unfaithful
ar.d disloyal.
There has seldom been in tiie courts of
San Francisco so scandalous and so un
savory an episode as this. The husband
is over seventy years of age and his wife
swears she is twenty-eight. In a married
life of four years there have been quarrels,
criminations, recriminations, bitterness
and unhapplness, surrounded by enormous

I and county government, and the character, au
j thnrity. rights and duties cf the officers thereof.
; Nor was the ruling In Kahn vs. Sutro dls
j puted until the decision In Martin vs. Board of
I Election Commissioners came down October 23,
j 1S9S. and the question now is, for the purposes '
I of the case at bar, did Martin vs. Board of
Election Commissioners overrule Kahn vs.'
Sutro?
The new charter had been presented to the
people of the city and county of San Francisco,
and by them adopted as their organic law May |
"IS, l c ??. approved by the legislature In Janu
ary. 1S53. and went into effect January S. 1900.
On November 3. 1S96. an amendment, section '
SS. article XI of the constitution, was adopted.,
and upon the construction of that section, to
gether with the Martin case, the controversy*
here dejiends.
Charter Provisions.
The latter paxt of subdivision 4 of eectlon 8H.
ertlcle XI of the constitution, is as follows:
"Where a city and county government has
been merted and consolidated Into one munici
pal government It shall also be competent in
any charter framed under section S of said
article XI to provide for the manner In which,
the times at which and the terme for which
the several county officers shall be elected or
appointed; for their compensation and for the
number of deputies that each shall have, and
for the compensation payable to each of said
deputies."
Under this amendment, the freeholders In
serted in the charter of 1SSS. among other
things, section J, chapter 6. article V: "The
Sheriff shall be elected bf the people, and he
shall hold office for two 3"eare." and similar
provisions as to the other county officers.
The Beard of Election Commissioners pro
ceeded to call an election. Sheriff Martin felt
aggrieved at Ioslne. after two years, the office
to which he had been elected by the people for
four years, and he hrourht Â»ult for himself ar
ac officer and a taxpayer and for other sim
ilar officer*â the came kind of action brought
by Kahnâ for the Identical redress and the
same kind of action now before the court.
The Martin case Involved but the one point,
just as the Kahn case did, and but one point
Counsel for Martin arjrued that the provisions
of tfce new charter fixing the terms of county
officers in the city and county of San Fran
cisco were In conflict with the constitution and
tho general laws of the State, and an invasion
of and infringement upon the sovereignty of
the State.
They said when the county government act
fixes the term of office of the Sheriff at four
years, the charter cannot reduce the term to
two years.
A ereat deal of the reasoning of the Kahn
ciÂ«se, concerning the character of the consoli
dated sovernment and the distinction between
the classes of its officers, was gone over in
the Martin ca.Â«e and the answer of the court
to the Question was that the amendment to
the constitution, section 8*4. article XI. In
terms, pave authority to the freenolders to ln-
Fert In the charter, and tHe r*ople to adopt,
the very thing of fixing the terms of those
oificers. * *
Status of Officers.
The court *aid at pane, â¢411: "And to remove,
any doubt that may hive previously existed
concerning the status oÂ©"f>f fleers of the class
(county) prosecutir.K thflf action, in mersed and
consolidated municipalities. It Is further ex
preysly provided in the amended section 8 and
S'4 that it should be competent In a freehold
ers' charter of such consolidated government to
provide for the election of such officers (county)
for such municipality. There is no room for
doubt, therefore, as to the purpose of the Leg
islature In proposing said amendment, section
J-H of art!cle,;XI, or of the people In voting upon
and approvinc the same."
At page 411: "The rule of construction In
voked by appellants seems to be that a proviÂ»
slon in a law or constitution In reference to a
particular matter Is Inoperative and void,' If it
be Inconsistent with the general provisions of
said law or constitution. TTie direct opposite Is
the true construction In such cases.
"Under tblfÂ» rule of construction It would be
immaterial whether the general county govern
ment act applies to the county of Ban Francisco
or not: fÂ°r although said new section 8"4 article
XI may conflict with other sections of the same
article, providing for a uniform system of
county and township government. It would still
be valid as to the particular case for which it
Is intended, for in such cafe the particular and
the general both stand togetherâ neither abro
gates the otherâ the former furnishes the rule
for freeholders' charters, the latter for all other
cases, and the court says at page 412: "But the
act establishing a uniform system of county
and township government does not and never
has applied to the county of San Francisco In
the pense claimed by appellants."
And the "sense claimed by appellants" was
that while section 64 distinctly and In terms
gave this authorityâ Kranted this powerâ to the
people of the city and county of San Francisco
still It was in conflict with the constitution and
laws of the State. The court decided against
this contention and that Is all the court could
decide in. that caÂ«e. and that Is all It did decide
In the case.
The Martin Case.
The court in the Martin case did not reverse
its ruling In the Kahn case; on the contrary by
reason of the only point Involved being the
length of term of the officers, deciding as it
did In the Kahn case, that it was four' years
and in the Martin case but two years, the
amended section SH article XI, having been
adopted between the dates of the two decisions
the utter absence of mention of so Important a
case as Kahn vs. Sutro. decided by the same
court, only three years before. Is an absolute
demonstration that instead of reversing the
Kahn case the court In the Martin case affirmed
It by determining that section S 1 * was purely
and simply a new constitutional exception to
the general rule therein laid down.
There Is no mention of qualifications for dep
uties In section 8^4, but there Is mention of the
number of them and their compensation.
To the extent, therefore, of the power ex
pressly given In section PA may the charter
apply to "county officers" of the city and
county of San Francisco, and no further.
The decision in the Martin case Is simply the
application of that ancient maxim concerning
the construction of written Instruments and
the Interpretation of laws. â¢ â¢ â¢
Vr"> case of Kahn vs\ Sutro 'Is yet the law
concerning the county) affairs of this consoli
dated municipality; exlcept as to the changes
wrought by the charter under the ffuthorlty
granted In terrriS by section 8>*4*of article XI
of the constitution of the State, and such coun

ALDRICH EMULATES
ACTION OF DR. ROSS
The fact that Dr. Ross did not present*
,hls first statement to President JordajT
before he made It public is cited as an
Instance of the breach of good faith on
the part of the distinguished sociologist.
After President Jordan had upheld Dr.
Ross for 1 several years before Mrs. Stan
ford, they declare, the chivalrous thins
for Dr. Ross to do would have been to
first show President Jordan the,rtÂ£Ue
me'nt. Had this been done, Dr. Â¦'Ross
might have omitted the part in which he
charges . his downfall to the interference
of San Francisco corporations.
The faculty members believe, however,
that it is due Dr. Ross to say that he
did not fully comprehend the situation.
He failed to realize that it was the al
leged Insult to her dead husband's mem
ory that Mrs. Stanford resented.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov.
19. â Another Stanford professor
has raised his voice in protest
against the enforced resignation
of Dr. Ross from his chair In the
department of economics and sociology.
This time the protestor is Dr. Morton A.
Aldrich, an assistant professor to Dr.
Ross In the economics department, and his
protest Is fhed in the shape of an empha
tic resignation from his position at Stan
ford.
Dr. Aldrich's reason, as stated in his
resignation which he forwarded to Presi
dent Jordan to-day, Is his Individual pro
test against the recent enforced resigna
tion of Dr. Ross from Stanford and
against President Jordan's subsequent ac
tion. .
The "subsequent action" to which Dr.
Aldrich refers is President Jordan's re
quest of Dr. Ross that he cease teaching
at Stanford at once Instead of at the close
of the present semester. Dr. Aldrich' a
letter to Dr. Jordan Is as follows:
PALO ALTO. Cal.,
Monday, Nov. 19, 1900.
Dr. David Starr Jordan, President of Leland
Stanford Junior Universityâ Dear Sir: With
deep regret I ask you \p accept my resignation
as assistant professor of economics in Leland
Stanford Junior University. I only take this
step, as you know, after extended conferences
with you. This reslRnatlon Is my lndividaul
protest against the recf-nt enforced resignation
of Dr. Rosa from Stanford University, and
against your subsequent action In the matter.
My reasons for this protest are neither based
on my agreement or disagreement with the
x-lewn of Dr. Ross nor on my personal friend
ship for him.
Nothing that you have said to me weakens
my belief that the request for the resignation
of Dr. Rosa meant unjustifiable Interference
with the Independence of a university teacher
within the proper limits of his freedom.
I protest with equal emphasis against your
action In the matter since Dr. Ross made pub
lic his statement concerning his resignation. I
refer to your statement which appeared in the
San Francisco newspapers, but most of all to
your action In asking Dr. Ross to cease teach
ing at Stanford University at once. Instead of
at the close of the present semester, for the sole
reason that he had made public his statement.
I prefer not to appear to acquiesce In the
course which has been^ pursued in regard to the
case of Dr. Ross.' As 1 1 wish' to make this state
ment of the reasons for my resignation public,
I ask that my resignation take effect at once.
Respectfully. MORTON A. ALDRICH.

Dr. Hopkins deplored the manner em

opinion that the negro should have been
executed, and quoted the words of Rev
R. F. Coyle at the meeting of ministers
held yesterday, that he should have been
hanged "on a gallows 50 cubits high "
The words of Dr. Hopkins met with the
approval of the assembly, who voiced the
opinion that since the punishment or

The following resolution was also
adopted:
NEW YORK, Nov. 19.â Two fierce
onslaughts on the church of
Rome enlivened the proceedings
at to-day's session of the Gen
eral Missionary Committee. On
each occasion an audience which filled
every part of the large auditorium in St.
Paul's M. E. Church, where the committee
is meeting, broke into applause and no
effort was made by the chairman to check
these demonstrations of approval.
The General Committee, .which is com
posed of all the Bishops and leading di
vines in the Methodist church of America,
has been in session daily since Wednes
day last. Upon several occasions during
former sessions when reference has been
made to anything pertaining to the
Roman Catholic church the same spirit
has been apparent. Upon no former oc
casion, huwever. has tl.at church been
spoken of in terms so unqualified.
The rirst person to advance to the at
tack was Bishop'Goodsell of Tennessee.
In the course of an address on the worlc
of the. Mothodist Episcopal church in va
rious raxts of Euiope no had oCtfUlon to
ppeak of the work c^ne In Italy and con
ditions obtaining there.
â¢ "In Northern Europe, for Instance, in
Germany and the Scandinavian coun
tries," the' Bishop said, "we have made
satisfactory progress, though we have a
great deal of interference and even oppo
sition to conten-1 with. Statistics show
that we have made as much headway
during the first thirty-five years in Europe
as we have in the same period in this
country, which offers a more congenial
soil for our record.
"In Southern Europe the conditions ara
somewhat dlffeiert. There the struggle
has been harder. There nre many who
doubt whether we have done any work-at
all in Italy, the land of superstition and
priestcraft, whether we could ever hope
to accomplish anything there in the face
of the tremendous press of adverse
thought with which we are confronted.
The fact is that we sent one of our work
ers into Italy. He soon made up his mind
that In Rome we had to do as do the
Romans. He began by training the young.
was as tremendous as it was spontaneous.
Dr. Drees said in conclusion that the
most promising field among the Spanish
speaking population in America was open
ing in Porto Rico, and advised the com
mittee to spare neither expense not labor
to oust Rome from that island.
Bishop Hartzell spoke on Africa, which
is his field. He said in part:
"We stand to-day in face of a revolt of
the pagan world against Christian civil
ization. In the far East Mohammedanism
is outnumbering the Christian religion by
numbpr of adherents. China has justi
slammed her door in the face of Chris
tianity. Only a few days ago her repre
sentative stood in Carnegie Institute in
Plttsburg and boldly threw down the
gauntlet to Christian culture in behalf of
the ancient civilization of his people.
. "Half the world is pagan, the other half
Christian, and our zeal and labor in the
first year of a coming century will decide
whether we shall win or whether the
Christian faith shall be deluged by pa
ganism and be buried for centuries. The
gravest problem confronting us in Africa
is the native question. The best states
men in Europe are at present solving that
question, and the humane tendency of
their work is truly gratifying. They all
declare with one accord that the Dark
Continent should remain Inviolate, the
home of .the black race."
Rev. Dr. Oldham reviewed the various
perplexing questions involving the domes
tic missions. The chief among these, he
said, was the poverty and the lack of
thrift which had become the heritage of
a great portion of the population In great
cities, and the indifference and even the
defiance met with in the camps of labor,
where the ehurch was thought to be In
conspiracy with the rich to keep the
worklngman down. This was only to be
overcome. by teaching the churches In the
cities that the whole city is the ward of
each individual church.
Bishop Thoburn spoke of the work in
Southern Asia and Bishop Cranston of
the eastern portion of that continent. The
latter pronounced Korea perhaps the most
promising missionary field In the world.
In Japan progress is hindered by the ra
tionalistic teaching in the schools, but the
Bishop said the field was nevertheless a
promising one.
"It was wise of the chairman to call
the subject on which I am to speak tho
work among the Spanish-speaking inhabi
tants of America; happily there is no
longer a Spanish-America. The last ves
tige of Spanish domination in this hemis
phere disappeared when the old Spanish
battleship Maria Teresa while being tow
ed to this country after being wrecked by
our guns laid her bones to rest on the
sands of the island which was the first
territory discovered.
% "A former speaker has said that a con
dition where half the world is pagan and
the other half Christian cannot long en
dure. The same can be said with as much
truth of a state of affairs where Christen
dom is divided into two great camps, with
Protestantism on one side and Greek and
Roman Catholicism on the other. The
time is uptfn us when anew the questions
which appeared in the Protestant refor
mation will begin to agitate the world
and demand to be pushed to their final is
sue.
"The Roman church at one time held
eway everywhere, but now Moth that
church and Spanish domination have
fallen off their high pedestals. When
Spain Is arraigned the Catholic church
should he arraigned with that power."
The applause which followed this sally
"The work is slow, but its value has
been recently testified to by the Pontiff
hirr-eelf, who has issued a sweeping inter
dict against the schools and every one
passing through their gates. This, how
ever, has only made us more determined
to wipe out a system which has create'l
out of a former man of empire a cringing
beggar with a monkey and a grind
organ."
The next speaker threw the gauntlet to
the church of Rome in terms as direct
and condemnatory as did Bishop Ooodsell.
This was Rev. Dr. C. W. Drees, who, for
a number of years, has been indentified
with the work of the Methodist Episcopal
church in" South America and was ap
pointed by the committee to take over the
supervision of the work among the Span
ish-speaking nations on this continent. â¢
In beginning his address Dr. Drees
made reference to the end of Spanish rule
In this hemisphere, and was roundly ap
plauded. He said:
by taking them into our schools and sem
inaries.

CUTCHEON/A CHICAGO RECORD ARTIST.
LONDON, Nov. 19. â A special from j
St. Petersburg says: One of the
most cherished ideas of the Tan- j
Slavic publicist is to detach Italy i
from the triple alliance, and a j
writer in the Rosslya, one of the newer!
of the St. Petersburg journals, proposes ;
to accomplish this and to overcome the
influence of Austria in the Balkans at one
stroke. He suggests that Russia shall put
Italy in the way of securing a foothold
or perhaps even dominant influence in
Albania. The editor of the Rosslya finds
that this idea has its disadvantages. The
plan he thinks, however, might be made
acceptable if Russia had to deal with one
Italy onlyâ the Qulrinal and political Italy.
But there is another Italy to be reckoned
withâ the Vatican and Catholic Italy, the
ancient enemies of the orthodox Greek
church. To substitute Italy for Austria
in the direction of Balkan affairs would
be. he thinks, like the change of King
Lear s daughtersâ Regan for Goneril. The
Rossiva thinks it sees indications of a
possible reconstruction of the triple al
liance, with England in the place of Aus
tria. It notes evidences of coolness be
tween the courts of Rome and v lenna ana
attaches great significance to the forth
coming visit of the young King of Ital>
to England among other countries.
Alleged Decoration Scandal.
A Paris special says: The Chamber of
Deputies to-day discussed the alleged dec
oration scandal, the reactionary press
having hinted for several day* past at an
unpleasant exposure regarding tratncK
ing in decorations. Finally it was said
that M. Jean de Crais, son of the MÂ»nwter
for the Colonies, had been paid 20,000
francs for his Influence to secure across
of the Legion of Honor for M. Edward
Druraont, proprietor of. tho Libre .Parole.
De Crais spoke feelingly on the subject
and said tne charge "was false. 31. de
Crais described the details of the decora
tion given by M. Mlllerand. the Minister
of Commerce, and the method followed,
pointing to the reasons for which the dec
orations were bestowed.
A lively debate followed, many Deiu
participating. The Government \*ad
asked to refer the subject to a magis
trate, and others suggested a law to re
strain the "calumnious press*.
M. Waldeek-Rousseau, the Premier,
ironically replied, scoring the anti-Re
publican" press for descending to su >
methods in its efforts to injure the iM...
lstry. He claimed the stories were noth
ing "more than political fabrications. The
Government explanations were approved
by a vote of 379 to 31.
Knew Nothing of "Doping."
The much-advertised meeting called for
to-day to consider the "doping" of horses
resulted in a farce. A handful of well
known "fi>orts," a few Americans and a
number of veterinary surgeons composed
the audience. Several of the speakers
said they believed the American jockys
used electrical appliances, but no evidence
to that effect was produced. The meeting
finally resolved into a discussion between
American and English trainers, where
upon the chairman remarked that the
object of the meeting was lost sight or
and invited all present who knew any
thing about "doping" to hold up their
hands. There was no response and there
the meeting ended.

Bulow. th<Â» imperial Chancellor, I
t-Tnphatically denied tfcÂ« assertion f re- 1
quently made abroad that the China sm
'â¢rcglio was traceable to ihe German bc
oupation cf Kiaochau. This statement ,
Â¦warf greeted by the SociaUs-t Democrats ;
with loud cries of "It i& quite true."
Count von Bulow expressed keen regret
that e;:ch a cry was heard in the German
I'arJiamciit. The Chancellor further de
clared he did not wish at present to say
anything which mifbt be prejudicial to
:he common objects of the powers in j
China, but felt ihe need of pulling him- j
self !n touch with the nation. Germany, j
he explained, had adhered io the aims and i
policy outlined in the circular to the allied â¢
governments. The alk'Ratio:;* that tne |
<Jo\ernmeru had not fure^een the Chineoo ;
crisis was true. But most of the other
nations likewise failed to anticipate that
the storm in the Far East would burst j'j
violently or so soon. .
"But," added Count von Bulow. "tae
premorJlory Higna did not escape us. We j

BALTIMORE. Nov. 19.â Much specula

the directorate of the Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad at its annual meeting to-day.
Captain John P. Green, first vice presi

board and second vice president of the
Southern Pacific Company, and Martin
Erdman of New York, were elected di
rectors in the places of J. Kennedy Tod of
New York. Henry Clay Pierce of St

By the election of Captain Green the
Pennsylvania's representation In the
Baltimore and Ohio directorate Is in
creased to two, the other representative
of the Baltimore and Ohio's big competi

No Marylanders are now left In the
Baltimore and Ohio board except the two

are Ex-Senator A. P. Gorman and C

It was stated after the meeting that the
only business transacted besides the elec

annual report which has already been
published. Samuel Salomon, chairman of
the board, who presided at the meeting
declined to discuss the significance of the
entrance of another Pennsylvania official

it is understood that the presence of both

Whether the improvement noted this
afternoon in the condition of Senator

possible to say. The continued intervals

body of Ella Dubose. daughter of
Mr3. J. M. Dubose of thie city,
reached here Sunday Â»from Boston,
Mass., near the harbor of which seaport
the girl met a horrible death in the rig
ging of the schooner Myra B. "Weaver.
Two others perished with her in a fright
ful storm that raged on Vineyard Sound
on Friday, the 9th of November.
The funeral took place to-day from the
home of her mother. There was a con
etant stream of callers at the house from
early morning till the hour of the funeral
and the little coffin was buried from sight
under a mass of white flowers. The little
girl was universally beloved and the
burial was one of the saddest here for
many months.
News of the tragedy reached the
parents of the dead girl after the ill
fated schooner, a dismantled wreck, had
been towed to a wharf in Boston harbor,
the girl and two seamen still swaying
dead in the rigging, from which it had
been Impossible to detach them until the
vessel wa3 moored to a dock.
For an hour or more hundreds, if not
thousands, of persons crossing: the East
Boston ferries, and on both the Boston
and East Boston shores, saw this awful
spectacle, perhaps never before witnessed
in the harbor of a civilized city.
Near the North ferry is Lelghton's
wharf. Shortly after 1 o'clock the tug
boats Mercury, Zetes and Juno brought
to the wharf the wrecked Weaver.
Lashed to the rigging, high up on a
broken mast near the crosstrees. was the
partly nude body of Ella Dubose. A rope
about the waist was fastened to the mast
head, and as the body swung back and
forth the head and arms almost touched
the feet.
Below the head hung down the long
brown hair of the girl.
Why was the body not removed before
the schooner was made fast to the wharf?
was the question on every witness' lips.
The wreckers said that, as there was a
hole in the boat, and as it was floating

Special Dlepatch to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA, Nov. 19.âConstruc

are concentrated on the last big steel
viaduct at Gaviota. Five others have
been completed at Arroyo Honda, Alka
traz. El Capltan, Reujio and Concepclon,
all within a space of thirty miles. Sev
eral days will be required to finish the
present steel work. It has been reported
by good authority that an engine would
pass over the closed gap about Thanks
giving. This is earlier than was pre
dicted a short time ago.
The heaviest bridge work has been en
countered between Surf and Ellwood, a
distance of less than eighty miles * in
which small bridges across ravines and
viaducts across canyons are absolutely
necessary'. More than 100 small steel
structures have been put in. The upper
country through the Los Alamos and
banta Maria valleys was more easily
handled by heavy rills and cuts. The
largest fill known to railroad builders is
on this line above Lompoc. The road Is
complete as far south as Gaviota, ballast
haying been placed some time ago.
H. K. Judah of the passenger depart
ment at San Francisco is here to gather
data to aid in arranging the new through
train schedule. He says the road Is a
splendid one to Gaviota. and, though an
immense amount of work must be done

upon Thomas P. Jones, the Temecula

law into their own hands. The prisoner
will be taken north to-morrow in charge

DUKE OP MANCHESTER AND HIS BRIDE. FORMERLY MISS HELENE
ZIMMERMANN, A BEAUTIFUL AMERICAN HEIRESS. THE MAR
RIAGE IS SAID TO BE A LOVE MATCH.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, WELLINGTON HO
TEL, WASHINGTON, Nov. 19.â It was re
ported to T day that burglars who wished
to gain access to the forthcoming reports
of the Walker Isthmian Canal Commis
sion had entered the Corcoran building,
in which the commission has its offices,
and had broken open the desk of Lieu
tenant Commander Staunton, secretary of
the commission. Lieutenant Commander
Staunton when seen to-night said that
when he attempted to open his desk a
day or two ago he discovered that the
lock was broken. His impression was
that it was the work of burglars who for
some purpose were seeking to get ad
vance information as to the conclusions
of the commission. He sent for a lock
smith, who persuaded him that the desk
had not been broken open, but that the
lock had become disarranged in the
course of usage. Tne lnclaent created
great excitement among the members of
the commission, who are in constant
dread lest enemies of the canal get the
results of their work ahead of Congress.
The report of the commission is being
closely guarded, and it. is said that some
of the members of the commission are
a"s yet unacquainted as to what the re
port will be. The best Information ob
tainable here is that the commission cer
tainly by a vote of 5 to 4, and possibly
by a vote of 6 to 3, will recommend the
Nicaraguan route. This is based upon
a number of circumstances, as well as
upon statements from the commissioners
themselves.
There is no reason whatever for be
lieving that the Panama route will be
recommended, and it is sain on good au.
thority that President MeKInley has been
given information as to the most prac
ticable route, which he will use in his
message. This, in line with the report,
will advocate the adoption of the Nica
raguan route: the ratification of the Hay-
Pauncefote treaty: the construction of the
canal without fortifications and the adop
tion of tolls discriminating in favor of the
United States, Costa Rica and Nicaragua
only so far as coastwise vessels are con
cerned and leaving the canal open to all
the shipping of the world.
It can be stated positively that the final
estimates of the cost of the Nicaraguan
Canal have not been completed. Engi
neers are still working on that, whereas
long ago they were called off the Panama
work. The approximate figures of the
cost of the Nicaraguan Canal are believed
to about $150,000,000. The majority report
of the first Walker Commission placed
the cost at $118,000,000, and General Hains
signed the Ministry report In which he
gave It as his judgment that the cost
would be $133,000,000. The big Increase in
the cost over the estimate of the first
Walker Commission is due to the fact
that the canal is to have a depth of thlr
ty-flve feetâ five feet more than that
recommended about two years ago.
Again this cost is said to be a rough
estimate of $150,000,000 for the Panama Ca
nal to be completed with locks, to which
must be added the figures at which the
Panama company will turn over its prop
erty and concessions to this country. This
has recently been placed as low as $25,
000.000. making the total cost $175,000,000.
But if the commission should recommend
the Panama route there is no likelihood
that the company would settle for any
thing like that figure. The commission
will resume its session in this city on
Thursday and It is expected to remain at
work throughout the week.

had been false reports about the Duke of
Manchester: that the Duke had never
been encased to any actresses; tlfat he !â¢>
not a spendthrift and has not been as
notorious as reports would make him.
He had only the kindest words to say of
his daughter and of whatever she may
have done. The Duke of Manchester has
met Mr. Zimmerman at the seaside In
this country, and is not a stranger to his
wealthy father-in-law. Besides being con
nected with very many railroads. Mr.
Zimmerman is a larpe stockholder in tho
Standard Oil Company and local concerns
and one of the lamest owners of coal
and iron lands in the West. While he has
been a widower for many years, he is
known as a royal entertainer at his man

marriage last week, and he cabled back
his blessings.

yj ON"DON\ Nov. IS.â An inspection

Â«-*â * the reported marriage of the Duke
of Manchester to Miss Helene
Zlnrnermaa cf Cincinnati is true. The
cremony occurred last Wednesday after-
D*on. The couple art- now In Ireland.
Vhen the Dowager Duchess of Manches
tÂ«r was asked if the report of the mar

I'owag-er Duchess went, to the church, in
:pected the records and found, to her
jreat surprise, that Cm marriage had oe
rurred.
Canon Barker, who ofScIated at the wed
fiing, relates how Mr. Lambart, one of
the Duke of Manchester's supporters,
Â¦when notifying him of the Dukes desire
to be married, described the prospective
bride as '"an American heiress with ten
thousand a year now iir.d unlimited pros
pects, as her father is one of the richest
men in America." In reply to questions
by Car.or. Barker. Mr. Lambart admitted
that the lady's parents were not aware
of the Intended rr.arnage. but as he pro
duced a license issued br the Archbishop
cf Canterbury, Canon IJarker could not

According to the Daily Mail, the mar
riage was the outcome of a lor.g and ro
mantic attachment, but it was only last
July, to use the words of the Duke hlm
eelf, that they discovered that they had
been in love with each oth*>r all the time.
"Then the Duke," says the Daily Mail,
"seeing: that many suitors were pressing
their attentions upon Miss Zimmerman,
claimed her for himself. The encagement
was announced, but waf denied by tho
relatives. Not being in a position to
marry, they decided to wait a while. A

they agreed to marry without delay. They

married for love. He has not asked and
does not hope for a dowry with the lady.

NEW YORK, Nov. 19. â The sixteenth
annual exhibition of the National Horse
Show Association began to-day In Madl
san-square Garden, and there were many
gToups of fashionably dressed men and
women there to greet the occasion. Never
was a horse show opened under more au
spicious circumstances, never one that
promised so great a crush during the week
as this. The animals that will be shown
are the finest In the country, and the peo
ple who will flock to the garden during
the week will represent society not only
of Ne-y- York, but of many other cities In
the East.
The beginning of the show this morn-
Ing was 'without great pomp. It consisted
merely in raising an orangÂ« flag with a
black horse In I the center, the official
device of the association, on the main
flagstaff of the garden, and ' the sound
ing of a trumpet within announcing to
exhibitors that within forty minutes they
might exercise their horses in the ring.
Before the echoes of the trumpet blast
had died away the ring was alive with
hunters and Jumpers scheduled to be
Judged later on.
Gorgeous In Its many trappings of yellow
and black, the time-honored colors of the
association, and. Its myriad lights, the
garden was a delight to the eye. . .
: As the day grew on the crowds In
creased j until they promised to break all
first-day attendance records. -Everywhere
brilliant costumes were conspicuous.-
Among the occupants "of the arena boxes
to-day were. Mrs. Clarence Mackay, Mrs.

There were 12,000 people at the garden ;

Immense Number of Letters and
Newspapers Received Daily.
About 20,000 newspapers and letters ar
rive dally, all of which have to' be sorted,
opened and classified, and for this purpose
a special staff is kept in the Apostolic
Palace. The Pontiff is supposed to open
and read all communications addressed
"Sanctltatl Suae Leonl Papae XIII, Fe

Impossible, even to a strong man, Car
dinal Rampolla, Secretary of State, has
it done under his direction, submitting to
the Pope tho most Important and press-
Ing communications. However, there are
some documents, the opening of which by
any other than the Pontiff, is. punished
by excommunication. These are ad
dressed "To His Holiness the Pope, Pre
fect of the Holy Roman and Universal
Inquisition." Also those which go
through the hands of the diplomatists ac
credited to the Vatican are read by the
head of tho church. _. TTT Â£'
Of newspapers Leo XIII each day
glances* through about seven or eight,
Italian- and French, also many translated
extracts from English, German and even
Russian ones, which have been specially
prepared for him. It has caused surprise
in many quarters that Leo XIII is so well
Informed about outside matters as he is,
as, of course. It would be supposed that
when extracts are made from papers only
what the reader desires cornea before
him. But the Pontiff is very shrewd,
and reads the | French and Italian jour
nals bo thoroughly that he has a very
good idea whenever anything is kept from
him, and insistsâ and has his wayâ on
having full reports.

Freaks of Electricity.
A few days ago an alarming accident
occurred In the Strand, London. By some
means the underground electric circuits
were, fired, with the result that the lid
over a manhole in the footpath was blown
high into the air. Large sheets of flame
then shot into the air for a height of
about ten or twelve feet, attended at fre
quent Intervals with sharp explosions.
The alarm was immediately given to the
fire brigade, who were quickly on the
spot, but it was Instantly recognized thai
their efforts were of no avail in the quell
ing of the conflagration. They conse
quently had to stand by and simply watch
the results of the erratic behavior of the
electric current. In a few minutes, how
ever, an electrician was on the scene and
he quickly subiugated the outbreak bv
9eyerlns the wires. Such accidents as
this are of frequent occurrence through
out the metropolis, but at this precise
point the number of wires Is great, which
made the incident far more serious than
Is generally the case.

This number exceeded the opening of last
season by about 3000.
"When It came to shooting a man out
Denver way in my time," said Bill Bniith,
dean of the guides, "the court's verdict
most always reflected public opinion re
garding the deceased. If it was shown
that the county -was well rid of him, the
circumstances of the shooting had little
t. right and the man who had been handy
with his gun was discharged, sometimes
with a vote of thanks. 1 mind one case
out there, though, which puzzled every
one and I didn't learn the explanation of
it until I met Jake Haskins ten yeara
later in New York. 1 don't want to say
ii. at the courts out there weren't pure
ar.d good and everything required by
justice. They were up to the average.
That didn't prevent money counting for
something, and It eyen tipped the scales
at times. The Haeklns shooting and sub
s<~cjuent trial proved this. The superin
tendent of the company's s=tore out there
was a man named Hyde, who hailed from
Bostou. Hyde was a civil spoken chap
und aside from the fact that he was too
particular about his dress the boys all
'iked him and in token of it they called
him 'Major.' -^^
"There was a rumor around camp that
Wajfir Hyde had left Boston suddenly be
cause of an angry husband: but no one
cared to investigate it. Nearly every
man in that camp had a past and as a
general rule we let them stay behind.
H asking drifted Into town one day,
shabby looking, but with a fc-ift of speech
that showed his education. Some of the
boys tried to pump him.. They found out
that he had been fa every big camp In the
West, but he didn't eeem to have any spe :
cial calling. We just put him down for a
tramper and helped him to live thinking
hr .would' move alone: when .he got ready.
Hasklns saw Major Hyde the second week
after he had arrived and the boys said
that after that he looked settled like.
Hvo> did not see Haskins until one day
wkfa he came Into the store. I wu there.
So was 'Black* Johnson and two other*.
Hyde hadn't no show. Hasklns Just

Put Up by a Denver
Murderer.
WHY HASKINS
DIDN'T HANG
walked right up to him and poked his gun
in his face. Hyde recogmized him all
light enough, but he. couldn't say a word.
He was facing sudden death and he knew
It. It was all done so quick that we
couldn't interfere.
" 'This will square it,' nald Haskins, and
he pulled the trigger. Hyde never moved
after he dropped and Haskins surren
dered peaceably enough. The Coroner's
jury found against him and he was held
for trial. Hyde had many friends and
Hasklns hadn't any. He didn't seem to
have any money either, and when word
went around that he had secured a law
yer to draw up his will and defend him
everybody around camp thought It was a
good joke. We wanted to do - the fair
I thing with Haskins and we asked him to
! tell us what he had against Hyde, prom
ising him that If It justified the shooting
we would back him up.
â¢" 'Hyde's -dead,' said Haskins, 'and I
have nothing- to say. It won't do you any
good to try to pump me. You might as
I well leave me alone.'
"There didn't seem much help for Ilas
kins after that and when we had told our
stories to the jury we didn't expect any
defense. There .was Hasklfis' own lawyer
from Denver, and. alongside of him was
another lawyer who had come all the way
from New York to help him. That gave
Haeklns good standing at once. It. was
I rumorfd that he was the -son of a wealthy
man, but neither Hasklns nor his New
Yoik lawyer would say anything about It.
"Well, sir,, that trial was a hummer.
The defense- showed - that Hasklns had
once had a sunstroke. They brought med
ical men from all over the country to
swear that he was temporarily Insane. No
such defense had ever been put up In that
country.. No motive was shown for the
shooting and it couldn't even be shown
that Hasklns had ever seen Hyde before
he struck camp. Some strangers with
money were very friendly with the jury
men, and when the verdict came In It ac
quitted Haskins on the ground that he
waa temporarily Insane- when he shot
Hyde. That was a wonderful verdict for
that country In those. daysâ and Hasklns
found it convenient to disappear as soon
as he was released. I ain't saying any
thing about the jurymen, but they -were
all flush of the long green after that trial.
Everybody "w'ondered where Hasklns got
his money and it was the talk of the
camp.
"I had most forgotten the case when I
met Haskins two years later In New York.
He hadn't changed much. He was work
ing then as a bookkeeper, he told me, on
a salary that barely supported him.
*â¢ '1 suppose, Jake,' Bald lyafter shaking
hands, 'that you spent all your money on
that defense. It must have cost you a
pile.'
" 'It wasn't my money.' said Jake.
".'Some philanthropist,- I suppose?'
" 'No,' replied Jake; 'it was a life Insur
ance .company.' And then he told me the
Btory. all but the grudge he wiped out In
shooting the major. Hasklns made up
his mind two years before he came out
Denver way that It was his duty to kill
Hyde. He knew the consequences of It
might be death and he had a, small boy
to look out for. Haskins said he was a
widower and at that time he was earning
a Rood salary. He couldn't leave this boy
unprovided for and he did not want to hang
for shooting Hyde. What did he do? Why
he went to a life Insurance company and
took out a $25,000 policy so written that
after It had been In force for a year noth
ing could break It except failure to pay
premiums. Hasklns worked hard for the
next year and saved enough to pay two
years' premiums in advance. He had the
policy made out for his boy and then he
went West to- km Hyde. -When they ar
rested him he had his lawyer write the
facts of the case to the insurance com
pany and asked them If they would, not
rather help him- in his' defense than pay
the policy. They sent one or their own
lawyers out there with money to Â¦ back
him. That was the way Jake Haskins
was acquitted, and I've thought since that
his abilities were wasted In bookkeeping-
He ought to be a financier, but after wip
ing out Hyde he lost ambition."â New

THOUSANDS SPENT
ON FOOTBALL GAME
Rush for Seats at the Opening
Saleâ Both Elevens Go Into
Secret Training-
BERKELEY, Nov. 19.â The sale of tick
ets for the Thanksgiving day football
game commenced this afternoon at 1:30
o'clock in the armory. A roll had been
formed early. In the morning which men
signed and they fell In line accordingly
when the sale commenced.
The men entered through the north door
of the armory and the women through the
_8outh door. Only one from each door was
"let In at a time. After these had pur-
chased tickets they were sent out through
a. third door. and two more admitted.
Those who belonged to the associate
student body and had purchased season
football tickets were given the choice of
seats. Other* were not allowed this privi
lege. Much objection was made to this
arrangement, especially on. the part of the
members of the alumni, w}io felt that
they were not receiving fair treatment.
Many had purchased season football tick
ets merely -to help out the management
and they felt 'that this should have en
titled them to the same privileges as
members of tho associated student body.
At 4 o'clock this morning, about fifteen
wide awake young men gathered at North
Hall and waited to sign the roll. For the
greater part students did not sign until
late in the morning. Each man was given
a number which entitled him to a certain
position in line. The same arrangement
was made by the co-eds, who were almost
equal to the men In numbers. They gath
ered in North Hall basement and watted
forthours their turn at the ticket sellers.
â¢ About 200- men and nearly as many
women were in line at 1 o'clock, but ow
ing to the wearisome slowness of the sale
the lines rapidly thinned out. In the first
hour and a half only twenty-five men
had secured tickets. An equal number of
co-eds made purchases, but as there were
two sets of ticket sellers the rate was
practically twenty-five to every hour and
a half. At 6 o clock the doors were
closed. Only 150 people, both men and
women, had secured tickets.
Out of this sale 11753 was taken In br
the management. This made the average
expenditure of each person something
Â¦over $11. Each person was only allowed
to buy five tickets, but in many cases
those "who did not want the entire five
tickets bought them for others.
Practically all of the good seats in the
covered section were sold and many of
the choice ones In the uncovered section.

suffering from a bullet wound from the
pistol of Special Officer Frederick L. Car

W"ollesen and Carpenter were engaged
in a game of poker in the saloon at Sev
enth and Brannan streets yesterday after
noon. An argument over the method of
dealing occurred. Without; warning Car
penter pulled his club out of his pocket
and threw It at Wollesen, who dodged it.
Wollesen. enraged at this attack, drew his
jack-knife from his pocket and attacked
Carpenter, who drew a pistol and warned
Wollesen that If he persisted in his at-
tack he would shoot. Wollesen, notwith
standing this threat, persisted in his on
slaught and received a bullet in the left
side of his head.
The Bhooting quickly attracted a crowd.
The police- were notified and Carpenter
was placed under arrest. Wollesen'.-
wound was dressed at the Receiving Hos
pital. Doctors Dorr and Starr, however,
were unable to locate the bullet.
Carpenter will be detained to await the
result of Wollesen's Injuries, which,
though serious, may not prove fatal. Car
penter was formerly employed as a grip

In the absence of J. H. Pettingill, the
position of presiding judge was ably filled
by Ed Cole, associate judge.__ Mr. Pettin

this afternoon.

much favorable comment. There were no
noticeable deiavs. and the fields were sent

J. T. Woods, the younger brother of
Johnny 'Woods, received notification vÂ«*s

little fellow was i-Â°\ down at Hawthorne

favorable auspicesâ the weather of course

events was served, the salient feature of
the eport being the impressive victory in
the handicap of Green B. Morris' 6uperb
Bir Modred colt Modrine, piloted by
"Mock" Coburn. To be sure, the distance

drive lost the place to l^avator by a neck

The Ipalance of the fields was somewhat
devoid of class, and it was not surprising
that three favorites were counted out.
The bolting ring wa.Â« liberally patronized
by a Iplg crowd, and nineteen layers of

INDIAN FIGHTER
IS A SURPRISE
Fair Sprinkling of Knock
outs at the Bay City
Athletic Club.
Torrid Mix-XJps, Climaxed by a
Bout Between Comanche Joe
Gregg and Charley
Hawley.
"Indian" JoÂ© Gregg, the Comanche
prizefighter, was the living, real sensation
last night at the regular monthly fistic
ehow of the Bay City Olub. His bout
with Charley Hawley, fast and furious,
went one round more than the- original
limit.. The extra round did not suffice for
a decision, Referee Lahey ending further
prolongation by calling the mix-up a
draw.
The Indian is no wooden Indian. He
fights like a demon and goes to his medi
cine like any white, sound-stomached
prizefighter. Crouching or rushing, he Is
always on the move and Â¦ Hawley found
out early in the game that he had to
fight hard. This contest was a fitting
close to what proved a very torrid even
ing. . -
Frank Nell and Johnny Scott began this
programme and In a not exchange of
blows soon brought their mill to a quick
finish. Scott's career was ended by a sin
gle upper-story punch in the first round.
Joe Allen and Jim Kelly tore over the
canvas for four rounds, Allen getting the
decision. Kelly swallowed a full-course
dinner of punishment and when the four
rounds were over he still looked hungry.
Both fighters were exhausted from the
heavy work.
Johnny Ware and "William Snailem went
four rounds of even fighting. Ware dls
played a modicum of science which at the
end gave him the contest.
Joe Sullivan, smaller but tougher than
his opponent, Jim Carney, fought four
rounds, the former getting the decision.
During the fight he set loose a hundred
or two of stiff left punches at Carney's
top piece and stomach.
Peter Coleman lasted one round and a
half against George Merrltt. Then he
went up in the air, came down again,
rolled over once or twice and listened to
the referee tolling out the seconds.
W. Foster and William O'Brien, both
seconded by baseball players, created a
sensation. In the second round Foster's
left came upward. O'Brien's chin stopped
the blow and over he went like a log.
But he was up in a flash and fought tho
round out. At the end of the third the po
lice thought that O'Brien had dono
enough suffering to work his way out of
purgatory, so the' fight was called off and
the referee gave Foster the medal.
Jack Sullivan and Jim Ryan started tho
hoots and hisses from the crowd. They
went four rounds, Sullivan petting the de
cision, seemingly for no other reason than
that his face was forever falling against
Ryan's left glove.
The draw for the Wednesday mfdweÂ«fc

at Pythian Castle. Sixty-four hourda wexa

FIFTH FATALITY IN LOS
ANGELES STREET TUNNEL
Workman Killed While City Council
Is Hearing Arguments as to
Its Safety.
LÂ£>S ANGELES. Nov. 19.-While the
City Engineer and the attorney for the
handsome Crocker residence on top of
the hill at Third and Olive streets were
wrangling before the City Council this
morning as to whether the big tunnel now
In process of construction to connect Hill
and Flower streets were a safe piece of
engineering, a mass of earth fell upon a
workman named George Russell, engaged
in timbering the face of the drift. Injuring
him so severely that he died at the Re
ceiving Hospital four hours later. This
is the fifth death that has occurred since
the tunnel was started and at various
times during ita construction public senti
ment has been wrought up to such a
pitch over the accidents that have oc
curred in it that further work on It nearly
had to be abandoned. Recently the sur
face of the hill which It pierces has been
caving in and the altitudinous property
owners have become alarmed lest their
households might slip into the maw of
the big bore. Among these is the mother
of Amy Crocker, who at the time of the
divorce from Porter Ashe brought her
daughter down here for seclusion and
caused to be built a stately pile which
overlooks the business section of the city.
The cave-ins that have occurred in the
tunnel, according to the agent of the
Crocker property! have endangered tho
residence, and to-day his attorney, Her
bert Brown, appeared before the City
Council and protested against the further
prosecution of work in the tunnel in the
manner In which it is being done at pres
ent, alleging that it was the opinion of
many expert engineers that the whole
thing would eventually cave in. entailing
an immense property loss and threatening
a loss of life that might prove appalling
were the tunnel ever thrown open to pub
lic use.
These statements were warmly contro
verted by City Engineer Oimstead. who
maintained that the work was perfectly
safe and denied that any competent en
gineer would decide otherwise. At the
same time he admitted that "the contract
had been let at a price so low as to make
it impossible to bore the tunnel In the
best possible manner. The contract price
is SSO.OOO. and the City Engineer claims
that to complete the tunnel . properly la
worth $125,000. The matter has been re
ferred to the Board of Public Works,
which will call in outside engineers and
make a thorough examination and upon
its decision will depend whether or not
the work will be proceeded with further.

BOTH CLAIM THE OFFICE.
Two Men Acting as City Justice at
San Jose.
SAN JOSE, Nov. IS. â There are two
claimants for the office of City Justice",
and until the matter is settled In court
The city will receive double service for the
one salary. City Justice Cobb. who was
recently appointed to the position by the
Supervisors, has refused to surrender the
office to Owen D. Richardson, who was
elected to the place bv the Democrats.
Cobb has locked the. city courtroom and
does not even go Into it himself, for fear
Richardson might slip in and refuse to
vacate. This morning he disposed of thÂ«
drunk list In the police station.
RJehardsorw has served notice upon all
the city officials that he is the duly
Â«-l*-cted Justice, and has warned the
Treasurer not to pay Cobb any more sal
pry. He has opened an offlce In Township
JuVtJce Wallace's court.
The trouble arises over the filling of tho
vacancy in the office caused by the. death
of Justice Gass. The tiupervlsors contend
their appointment holds until 1993. while
Judge Rhodes decided it expired as soon

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA CRUZ, Nov. 19.â Testimony was
heard to-day In the Superior Court In the
broRch of promise suit of Mrs. Francc3
Buelna against John M. Ryan, a wealthy
farmer of Pajaro Valley, for $15,000 dam
ages. The- plaintiff testified that she wa3
born at San Juan forty-eight years ago.
She was married twice, but could not
recollect the years the marriages took
place. She is the mother of thirteen chil
dren. She said that at the second time
she met Ryan he talked of marriage, and
she said if she found a man who was
honest and would provide for her and
make her life happy, she might be induced
to marry ajraln. no matter how old the
man was. Ryan exclaimed that he was
the person who answered the require
ments. Then they both arose and shook
hands to bind the matrimonial bargain.
This was on August J>. 1838. She ad
mitted that she did not love him then, but
the more she thought of his promise to
make her happy the greater vbecame her
attachment for him. Believing in his
promises she kept house for him and
their relations became Intimate. Last July
the engagement was broken off. he re
turning the ring she gave him. Then he
gave her $100, telling her to do what she
pleased with it. Subsequently he visited
her at her home here, and promised her
another $100, saying he intended to pur
chase a home In Los Angeles where they
both could live.
The defendant's attorney aBked Mrs.
Buelna is she had ever sued a man for
breach of promise before, but the question
was ruled out. Ryan is about 65 years
old.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Nov. 19.â Two men were
thrown from the trestle above the bunk
ers In the California and Northwestern
Railroad yard at'Tiburon at noon to-day
and were burled beneath fifteen tons of
coal and wreckage of a coal car tha#
plunged over the end of the trestle. Both
men are alive and probably will recover,
though they were entombed fully twenty
minutes.
The accident happened as several coal
cars were being pushed up the trestle,
which runs over the coal bunkers. They
were in charge of John Krbini and Albert
Humbert. The cars had been pushed up
the steep incline leading to the top of the
trestle by the yard engine and were then
uncoupled and allowed to proceed down
to the end of the trestle, where the two
men tried to stop them. The brakes were
put on, but the wheels slid on the_wet
rails and the cars crashed Into the lwavy
bumper at the end of the trestle. This
was snapped like a match and the end
car and the men were thrown to the
ground, twenty feet below. As the great
bowlders of coal struck the ground tho
men fell between and were thus given
some protection from the tons that were
piled upon them.
The alarm was instantly given and a
gang of men set at work to dig out the
buried employes. The two were believed
to be dead until after a few minutes work
groans were heard. This caused the res
cuers to redouble their efforts, and in
about twenty minutes two bruised and
bleeding bodies were dragged from tho
debris and turned over to Dr. Scott of
Belvedere, who did all possible for the
unfortunates.
It is impossible to tell at present how
seriously the men are injured. It Is
feared that Erbini has sustained internal
Injuries. As the car went over It broke
in the middle and hajf fell to tho ground
on top of the coal and men, while the re
maining portion was held by its couplings
to the car on the trestle.
Death Defied- by Two Em
ployes of Northwest

and for a while she thought she would
have to jive up the army work alto
gether. Then she became acquainted with
the rescue work and found that just fitted
to her strength and taste.
Miss Farrington is 27 years old. She
first became interested in Salvation Army
work two years ago in Webster Groves.
She had from girlhood been a conscien
tious viorker in the Congregational church
there. When the army began holding
meetings in the town she attended. The
more she s=aw of the methods and results
the more interested she became, and the
outcome of it was that she joined the
army.
She went to Chicago and entered upon
a course of training for the work. Ever
since then she has been connected with
the Chicago division of the work.
PROPOSED CHANGES IN
SAN JOSE'S CHARTER
Bight Questions* Upon Which the
Garden City Voters Will
Ballot. ,
SAN JOSE. Nov. 19.â An election will be
held on Tuesday, February 5, to vote on
a number of changes In the city charter.
These were proposed after a conference
between city officials and the members of
the Board of Freeholders who drafted the
charter three years ago. There are eight
questions to be submitted to the people,
and It is claimed that their adoption will
make the running of the city mucn easier.
The most radical change is in ihe pro
posed street law.
The ilrst proposition Is a change In the
charter so as to allow the city to adopt
the State law governing special elections,
and the second Is to the effect that mu
nicipal election officers shall receive a
compensation not exceeding IS.
The third is to change the charter so as
to allcv the Council to elect a mayor in
case of a tie vote.
It is provided by the fourth proposition
that whenever the money in the cash ba
sis fund is sufficient to meet all the mu
nicipal expenses from July 1 to December
1 tho municipal fiscal year shall be
changed to December 1; also that the cash
busls fund can be used temporarily In
different funds, but must be returned be
fore the end of the fiscal year.
Number six provides that tho street
light fund is to be used only for light-
Ing purposes, and the lightning of the
various city departments must come out
of their respective funds.
The City Board of Education is given
authority to flj^the rate of tuition to be
charged outside attendants at the High
School. Permanent teachers in the schools
may be removed on the recommendation
of the City Superintendent of Schools and
the vote of a majority of the board, or
upon the recommendation of the Classi
fication Committee and a vote of four
members of the board; also for a cause
charged and sustained. Another clause
of the sixth proposition allows teachers
holding high school certillcates to teach
in the city.
No city officer, of any kind shall hold
office under county. State or national gov
ernments.
The eighth proposition is in regard to
the improvement of streets. It eliminates
that part which allows the protest of a
citizen to delay work six months. 'After
a contract has been let by the city for
the work the property owners affectea
have ten days in which to let private con
tracts. The contractor must give a sure
ty bond Instead of a personal one. After
an estimated assessment is made, the
Council can fix a day for the equalization
of the assessment. "Where the cost of Im
provement amounts to less than $25 it
mtiBt be paid within sixty days, but where
It is more than that It may be paid in
five yearly Installments. A bond so pay
able and bearing a low rate of interest
shall be issued against the property. In
case the payments are not made the prop
erty shall be sold as now. and the owner
have a year to redeem it in.

witnesses were examined by the prosecu
tion in rebuttal to-day. Herman Shutto
testified that on the day of the murder he
had a fight with Cech. It was this rov/
that caused Begerow to arrest "Bis
marck." His testimony was unimportant
Sheriff Langford was called and he said
Begerow looked as though he had been
drinking. .
This closed the case and argument wa?
commenced. Attorney W. L. Gill opened
for the prosecution. Attorney 'Herrington
will follow for the defense and District
Attorney Campbell will close for the
people.

tickets and she riding with you so much
Now, Billy, I wish you wouldn't encour
age her to ride on your train and that

heard Billy Martin say that he would
blow the top of my head off."

VANCOUVER. Nov. 19.â One of the
fiercest storms that ever swept over this
province has been raging for three da>"3.
Last night and to-day it was at its
height all through British Columbia, and
to-night reports Irom the interior are that
the snowfall is very heavy. The wind h;\Â»
blown it into drifts and many roads and
i runs are impassabie. seiners in dis
tricts that are not even remote have been
cut off from communication with the out-
Bide world. .Passengers on incoming
trains say the snowdrifts are piled up
several feet high along the tracks.
A great deal of suffering has been
caused by the sudden cold snap, which is
unprecedented for this season of the
year. 'The only death bo far reported i3
that of Patrick Roach, a mill employe at
the Canadian Pacific Lumber Company's
plant at Port Moody, twelve miles from
Vancouver. Roach was found this morn
ing a few yard3 from his cabin door,
where he had fallen and frozen to death.
He had left a tavern at the village at
midnight, and his tracks in the snow
were evidence that he took a very
rambling course oh his way to his little
cabin.
On the Chilcoten plains the Indians have
been in a half-starving' condition all
through the fall, and now they a*e In dire
straits.
The principal Inconvenience in the coast
cities is a famine of coaL There are lists
of unfilled orders a yard long in all the
coal companies' offices, but none of the
hard or anthracite variety can be ob
tained. Additional damage has been
caused to telephone and telegraph wires,
and the work of repairing is practically
at a standstill.
At Nelson during the windstorm last
night several Kootenai Lake steamers
broke from their moorings and were dam
aged. Log booms were wrecked.
SEATTLE, Nov. 19. â While no serious
damage so far as known has resulted, the
storm of Sunday and Sunday nignt ma
terially interfered with Puget Sound ship
ping. Five or six lecal steamers attempt
ed to leave during the storm, but had to
put back to port, owing to the severity
of the gales. Even to-day thdr masters
thought It ill-advised to venture out
again. All, however, left to-right. Among
the vessels forced to temporarily abandon
their runs were the State of Washington.
Fairhavei, Greyhound, F. D. Smith and
T. W. Lake.
Telegrams received last night by John
LJbby. manager of the Pugrt Sound Tug
boat Company, stated that the weather in
the Straits of Fuca and off Cope Flattery
was the roughest In years. For several
days it required two tugs to get a sailing
vessel, past the cape and through the
straits. Â¦ To bring in the ships B. P.
Heney and Two Brothers yesterday it
was necessary to have the assistance of
four tugs. Even In sheltered Neah Bay
the wind reached a velocity of twenty
flve miles an hour for three days, indicat
ing that more than twice as preat a wind
was raging in the straits and off / the
cape.
Two schooners, the Stlmson and Bax
ter, both at Ballard. dragged their
anchors yesterdays and were all but
driven on the beach. To guard against
further danger two tugs were dispatched
to their assistance this afternoon. In the
straits and off the cape the gales were
from the â¢; northeast, usually accompanied
by heavy snows.
RENO. Nov. 19.â Snow fell to a depth
of a half-foot In, the hills near Reno to
day. The downfall in this city was prob
ably a half-Inch. The mountains west of
town received a heavy fall, which insures
plenty of water for irrigation purposes
during the summer. Snow Is now falling
fast here, with Indications for a continu
ance.
SPOKANE. Nov. 19.â This Is the coldest
November night ever experienced in this
eectlon. At 9 o'clock the temperature
stood five degrees above zero, and the
weather obsen-er says It will touch zero
before morning. A keen northeasterly
wind is blowing.
SAN DIEGO, Nov. 13.â The rainfall to
day was only six hundredths of an Inch,
maklr k the precipitation for the season
.92. This, however, only refers to this
city. In the interior the precipitation has
been much larger. The storm does
apnear to be over.
PORTLAND, Or.. Nov. 19.â Ught snow

Before leaving to-uay fcr San Francisco
OÂ»pta!n MonJaur.t said he was more con
c.^rn^d about the fate of the schooner
than about the value of his new posses-
Fions. The vessel is a stanchiy built

burden, which lÂ«ft Nome for San Fran
c:pco The lart of October in charge of Cap
tn:n P. Forward. Captain Mordaunt was
to have come down aboard her, but owing
to seme circumstances as yet a mystery
to him thÂ» Carrie and Annie set sail for
Nome prematurely with $10,000 worth of
coal and supplies bclnntfnp to him. He Is
now trrtax to locate her, and is somewhat
worried over her 'ate.
Shaking: of the circumstances leading
up to the discoveries. Captain Mordaunt
said to-day:
"My schooner had been chartered by
I-^ckie & Moore of Nome, owners of the
oral mine a.t Cap*. IV.sborne, to bring
(Sown a cargo of coal. She left Xome the
latter part of September, and through
etress of weather had to put in at Port
Clarence. "While waiting- there a delega
tion of miners headed by Frank Walters
crgagfd passage on her to Cape Dyer, a
point below the coal mine*. The schooner
was to land there on the way up and pick
them up on the way back. After four
days the schooner returned, having found
It imr^spible to prooure coal owing to the
stormy weathf-r. and picked up the four
men. To the surprise of everybody, they
msdc rich discoveries of placer grounds.
One nan in eight hours, according to his
own statement, had rocked out JS7 in gold.
"Walters reported to me that the coun
try was marvelously rich. He. the other
miners and the sailors on the schooner,
fourteen in all. staked about sixty-eight
claims, all showing fine prospects. An as-
Fociaiion has been formed at Nome for
the development of the properties, Â¦with
myFe'.f as manager and Frank "Walters
and Frank Forward as trustees, the three
of us holding powers of attorney from all
the others.
"It w?s too late in the season for any
one in Xome to get up there this fall, al
though some may attempt to reach it
overland during the winter. It will, how
ever, prove a hard trip."

and calm while the noose was being ad
justed. He occasionally braced his
shoulders back and kept his lips and
eyes tightly closed, not looking at those
assembled afLer he tooK his place on the
drop.

LOS ANGELES. Nov. 13.â U the Metho
dist ministers of Los Angeles had munic
ipal affairs in their hands the fiesta
would be Immediately declared off. Min
isters of other denominations agree with
their Methodist brethren, who at their
weekly meeting this morning considered
the following resolutions:
Resolved. That we, as a body of ministers,
protest against the proposed revival of La
Fiesta.
Re*olved. That we Invite all ether workers
for the purity of our city and people to worlc
with us against this mother of crimes and
dissipation.
The resolutions caused much comment,
a few of the pastors being in favor of
the fiesta, but the majority denouncing
it in no uncertain terms. It was finally
decided not to adopt the resolutions until
thtre was positive proof that the fiesta
committee intended to carry out the car
nival along the old lines.
The consensus of opinion Is that tho
floral parade and other parades are harm
less, but that the festivities of the last
night, "all fools" night," are conducive
only to evil. .â¢
Rev. Will A. Knight said In regard to
the matter at the ministers' meeting to
day that -the history of former flestai
held in this city had been records of
degradation, the open saloon and the open
brothel. The keys of the city were turned
over to a false government. If It were
true that there was any intention of re
peating this thing, he believed the min
isters oueht to send a petition to Presi
dent McKlnley to come before such cele
bration were held or wait until It were
over.

CAUTORNIAITS EN" WASKDTGTO2I
When the party has been rid of those things Mr.
Catchings would have it load up with others. He does
not suggest going forward to find new things, how
ever, but advises returning and picking up some of
the things the Bryanites threw over. Thus he says:
"Revive the question of taxation; teach the Demo
cratic doctrine that people cannot be made rich by
taxing them; assail the favoritism and wrongs of a
high protective tariff; stand for the control of trusts
and combines by methods not oppressive; demand en
largement of the powers of the Interstate Commerce
Commission, and the liberal improvement of harbors,
and insist on local self-government, and let the next
Presidential candidate remain at home during the
campaign."
No one will deny that such advice is eminently re
spectable and conservative, but there is something droll
about the idea of reviving the fight'against protection.
Mr. Catchings is clearly still living in the mem
ory of the great days when a President of the United
States* addressed him a letter of national importance.
He would like to return to that time so full of dig
nity for him, and so indulges the; belief that he can
get the Democratic donkey to go with him. The in
cident is of interest as" an illustration of the kind of
leaders Democracy has, and what sort of men intel
ligent Democrats have .to. deal' with in trying to re
form their party. â¢
While all those things are being dropped Bryan
could of course be quietly dropped also, and Mr.
Catchings wisely leaves that 'to be inferred without
saying anything about it. Evidently he would' like
that particular drop to be made so gently that noth
ing would be said nor anything heardâ not even a
soft sound like that of Dennis sliding to the mud.
"Drop free silver, drop fusionism, drop the cry of
government by injunction, drop the cry of imperial
ism and militarism, drop all discussion about the Phil
ippines until peace has been restored, drop appeals to
the passions and prejudices of the idle and discon
tented."
Mr. Catchings begins very properly by first telling
the party what it must get rid of. He recognizes that
it would be useless to try to build anything in the way
of salvation upon the fabric of the platforms adopted
by the party at Chicago and at Kansas City. He sayi:
MR. CATCHINGS' CONCLUSION.
PERSONS who have good memories will recall
that far back in the old days of wrangling over
the Wilson-Gorman tariff President Cleveland
wrote an extraordinary letter to "My dear Catch
ings." By reason 'of that letter the Congressman
from Mississippi attained a sudden eminence in poli
tics. He lived in the light of fame for a little while
and then sank back into obscurity. He is still, how
ever, in the land of the living, and also in Congress.
He has just made another rise to the light and has
attracted some attention by reason of a programme he
has put forward for the reformation, reorganization
and redemption of the Democratic party.

COCK R ANâ J. C. Port Costa. Cal.
William Bourke Cockran was born In Ire
land February 23, 1854. He came to the
United States in 1S71, taught in a private
academy, later became the principal of
a public school In Westchester County,
N. Y., and In 18TB was admitted to prac
tice law. As he had to be a citizen of the
United States to be admitted to practice,
he must have been naturalized a citizen
the same year that he was admitted to
practice.
CHURCH PROPERTY-J. II.. Merced,
Cal. The questions asked all depend upon
the valuation of church property In the
State of California at this time, and as
there are no figures giving such valuation
the questions cannot be answered. The
valuation of Â«uch property cannot be
given until the census returns on churches
are all In. That will not be for some time
yet. The valuation of church property
all denominations, at the census of 1S30 In
.California was $11^1.014.

PERSONAL MENTION.
There is one thing further to be noted. When the
elections were to be held to take charge of the city
under the new charter there was found no difficulty
hi getting the foremost citizens to accept the -duties
of the government. Just before the candidates of the
various parties were named the Bishops of London
and Rochester, and '.he heads of the churches in. the
city, addressed the voters," saying: Â¦
"We hope that candidates will be selected solely
Another conservative trait is shown in the extent
tc which old-time laws are retained. Thus the Chron
icle says the government act "is one of the strangest
examples of legislation on the statute-book. It is
legislation by reference â a mere skeleton of a meas
ure, which has to be filled in by consulting many
other acts; and for its' working and the conduct of
the elections innumerable acts, rules, orders and cases
have to be studied. Commissioners have been at
work upon it ever since it was passed, and such com
missioners are still holding ir.fluirics; and decisions
about the system of collecting rates, the control of
charities, and other matters, have yet to be given by
the Privy Council."
It is predicted that a good many years will pass
before the various boroughs become homogeneous and
the scope of their authority under the County Council
fully determined. Some of the boroughs are soqial
istic and have already under the old district boards
established a great many municipal institutions/such
as electric lighting plants, bath-houses and markets;
while in others the people will not even esfablish a
public library, and everything except government
itself is left to individual enterprise.
It must not be supposed that the new act is in any
way revolutionary. British conservatism was never
more strikingly shown than in the manner in which
it has reconstructed the capital. Had Americans
been set to work to rcdistrict the city for govern
mental purposes they would have abolished the old
medieval boundaries altogether and made the various
boroughs about equal in size. The British, however,
kept as many of the old parish limits as they could,
and there are many inequalities among the boroughs.
They vary in population from 336,000 in Islington to
50,000 in Stoke Newington; in ratable value from
Â£5,062,000 in Westminster City to Â£.322,000 in Stoke
Newington, and Â£4^4,000 in Bethnal-green; and in
area from 409 acres in Holborn to 9106 acres in
Wandsworth.
The act establishes twrnty-e!i?ht borough counrllB In
place of forty-two administrative vestries nnrj district
board*, and about W) minor and subordinate a'Uhorl
tl'-fl which are either iuperteded or absorbed. Tho coun
cils take over all the municipal work of tho vestries-^
cutting off the connection with the churrhes, which will
Btlll have their vestries occupied exclusively with ec
dwdttttlcal matterfi- ntjd will have a few duties trans
ferred from thÂ» County Council with power to extend
their functions in new directions. The members of the
councils will vary from thlrtjr-flVS to seventyâ exclusive
of Mayor. Th<-re will be lifA CouncHors and 2^3 Alder
rm-n In place of ovr-r 47.30 rnt-mbers of .the existing au
thorities. Th<j nomenclature connected with vrstrydom
disappears absolutely. There will be no more vestry
clerks, but town ckrkH. Vestry ofnce3 will be renamed
town hallK, with municipal buildings. There will be
borough cnglnc-erB, borough accountants, medical ofll

IONDON" is going to begin the new century
with a new charter and a radically new system of
â * government. It will be indeed the first time the
huge metropolis has ever had anything like a consist
ent and harmonious government. In the progress of
its growth through the centuries the city has absorbed
a large number of communities, each having a gov
ernment of its own known as "vestries" or as "district
boards," and nil of these little governments have held
authority over their original areas, notwithstanding'
their connection with London. The new act abolishes
all of these old village and parish governments and"
reorganizes the city on a new plan. ' .
The London Chronicle, in describing the new sys
ttm, savs:
LONDON'S NEW CHARTER.
Such is the lesson to be drawn from the report of
the Commi??ioner of Navigation. The issue is one
that Congress should no longer hesitate to deal with.
It iÂ« a foolish policy to pay to foreigners $200,000,000
annually to carry our exports and imports for us, and
it is high time a wiser policy were adopted.
TJie difference if due to the difference in the wags
rate and to the enormous amount of work British
thipyards carry on. Should our ship-building indus
try be built up bjr proper legislation and our ocean
marine be placed on an equal footing with the ships
of competing nations, we would soon develop plants
that would be able to construct ships as cheaply as
in any other part of the world, and that without re
ducing the wage rate in any respect. Protection was
needed to give our steel industry a start, but now we
produce steel at less cost than the British, while main
taining the high rate of American wages. The same
result would speedily be attained in the shipyards if
the protective principle were applied to our ships on
the high seas.
Details givn in the report show that the truth is
even worse than appears on the face of the statistics
as a whole. Thai the report says that "for serious
competition with foreign nations in the ocean carry
iT!g trade we are practically restricted to ninety-seven
rep;i<trred steamships of over 1000 tons, aggregating
2^0.320 tons. Single steamboat corporations in other
countries own greater tonnage. Japan has eighty
threr ocean fteamships of over 2000 tons, aggregating
786,200 ton*. He-sides the?e steamships we have 125
registered square rigged sail vessels, over looo tons
each, for th* deep sea trade. More than half of theÂ«e
are over twenty years old, and as such vessels disap
pear their places are not supplied by construction."
The causes of this defective condition of our mer
chant marine are mainly two â first, the cost of con
structing fliips is higlier with us than with any of ou
great competitors because of the higher rate of wages
that prevails here; and second, because foreign ships
receive liberal subsidies and bounties to aid them in
the struggle for supremacy. It is shown in the repoit
that a freight steamship carrying 5000 tons cargo
costs in the United States $275,000, but can be con
structed in Great Britain for $214,000. notwithstanding
the fact that stee! is cheaper here than there..
Such showing is .itartling. The thirteen original
States of the Union have now less ocean tonnage
than they had a century ago, the whole Union has
now not much more than the original thirteen had
when the republic b-rgan its career. Our total ocean
tonnage is less than o/jo,ooo gross tons; that of Grea:
Britain it brer 14,000,000 gross tons.
A MKiimary just received from Washington of the
annual report of Commissioner of Navigation Cham
bcrlain shows the striking contrast between the two
c!a<.-es of Â«hips. The report says: "On June 30, 1900,
American documented tonnage comprised 23,333 ves
*el*, of c. 104X40 gross tons an increase of 300,000
ton*, over the previous year. Our maximum tonnage
*as 5.539J8IJ tons in 1861. Our shipping at that time
was larger than that of France and Germany, and
nrariy equaled the British empire. American vessels
are now almost wholly confined to the coasting trade,
which <mp1oyrd laÂ«t yrar 4.^8.145 tons, or more than
the total tonnage of Germany and France. British
shipping now amounts to 14,261,000 gross tons. Our
tonn.igr in the foreign trade was oniy 816,795 tons,
ar.d carrird this year only 9 per cent of our exports
and imports. A century ago American shipping
registered for foreign trade was 669,921 tons, while
this tonnage now in the thirteen original States
amount* to 4#2.o/)7 tons."
WHKKK protection is granted itâ that is, in the
â¢ â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦. *:r.g trade â American shipping has had a
prn<-i*-Tf>u% yrar and has made a record of
energy and progress north)' of the greatness of th-^
ration. L'j>on the ocean, however, where no protec
tion or encourage- lent it given, the statistics of the
year ibow a condition of affairs that is altogether dis
credhaWe. In the coasting trade we have accom
plished wonder*, hut upon the seas our commerce is
still drjx-ndcnt upon the shipping of foreigner*.

There can be no valid objection to the creation of a
Department of Commerce, and from the mining
States no objection will be made; but the need of
such a department is not greater than that for a De
partment of Mines. Mining is one of the great indus
tries of the Union. It is carried on to some extent in
almost every State. It employs thousands of men and
many millions of capital. Its output is increasing
from year to year, and the methods by which it is
carried on are becoming more and more complex.
Nevertheless the Government's relations with the in
dustry are scattered :hrough several departments and
divided among many bureaus. Jt is impossible to
adequately supervise and promote the industry so
long as that condition prevails. The creation of a
Department of Mines is therefore as important as that
of a Department of Commerce. At the very least
there should be a Mining Bureau having full charge
of all governmental dealings with the industry, and
the present is a good time for mining men to urge the
reform with all the power at their command.
For a long time the merchants and manufacturers
of the East have sought the creation of a department
to supervise those great interests. The Philadejphia
platform expressly declares for such an increase of the
Cabinet. The plank says: "In the interest of our
expanding commerce we recommend that Congress
create a Department of Commerce and Industries in
charge of a Secretary with a seat in the Cabinet. The
United States consular system should be reorganized
under the supervision of this new department upon
Â«=uch a basis of appointment as will render it more
serviceable to the nation's increasing trade."
The number anc? the variety of reforms that are re
quired to give our laws a character that will promote
mining rather than hamper :t renders the occasion
a fitting or.c to rent*- the agitation for the creation
rf a national Department of Mine3 2nd .Mining to
take charge of the whole subject and bring all of our
laws and statutes into a harmonious system. It is al
together likely that a strong movement will be made
toward a reconstruction of the governmental depart
ments of the nation either this winter or during the
next Congress, and that will give a further aid to the
plan for establishing a Department of Mines.
AT every gathering the miners of California find
before them in their annual conventions many
matters of importance to engage their atten
tion and much in the -.vay of urgent work, to be done
Hardly at ar.y time, however, have graver questions
confronted them th2n these with which they have now
to deal. There is need of something like a radical re
vision of all the mining laws, and it is from the miners
themselves that both the Legislature and Congress
expect enlightenment to guide them in the work.

UTTERANCE
IN VARIETY
All these things will be considered by the Mari
time Convention which has been called by the Gov
ernor of Georgia. There should be immediate and
powerful response to this very patriotic call. The
movement has in it the zest of a new departure. It
comes from the South. It is a sign of the full re
instatement of the old spirit of commercial adventure
in that section, which has seemed so long dormant.
The State of Georgia has in Savannah a great sea
port. Along the South Atlantic seaboasd and the
Gulf coast are important seaports and every condition
friendly to ship-building and maritime pursuits. It iÂ«
we'I to Join aH these in a common effort to send the
merchant flag of the Union ail over the world.
California mu<t have a strong delegation at the
coming convention.
Now the maritime States have reached a point when
doty to themselves and the country requires that they
conquest the blue water transportation. Their indus
tries require it They war.t employment for their pfo
p'e iri American shipyards and on American ships.
They want the vast commerce sent to them from the
:r.Â«ide States for foreign export to be carried under
the American Sag and not under an slien pennant.
They itrzr.t out blue water transportation system to bs
made the eqca! of our land system by rail. They want
our facilities increased not only to accommodate our
own commerce but to do the ocean trade of the world.
The b:!!ior.5 spirit on railways have been cheerfully
fcrnisheti by the seaboard cities to be Â«pent in the
mediterranean States, ar.d the coasts have cheerfully
given c? their interest in the public domain for land
grants to roads have borne their share, and it is the
Izr^tr share, of taxation to raise subsidies or bestow
public loans upon the interior States to improve their
transportation system.
THE Governor of Georgia has inttkted a tnoÂ«t
important rr.-vemer.t thai should have the fail
2nd irrnsdiate it:pport of all o-r ctsrttim?
The interior region makes its wants known through
a Trans- Mississippi Congress, an Irrigation Congress,
a National Lirestock Association ar.d va.r~.o-.i3 isioci
2tM ownmerctal bodies like the National Board of
Trad*. The maritime States are not insensible to the
importance of the interests represented by thirt va
rious h<A:a t nor do they restrain their spirit of gener
osity when ztd is reeled from Congress for ary of the
purposes prorr.otfi 07 these means. Heretofore the
maritime States, hoâ ever, C2vÂ» not organized to pro
cere assistance for their special interests. What they
need above alJ things :s a revival of ocr ntcrchar.t
rr.arir.f . The interior States needed to re2ch the sea
board by rapid and reliable transportation is order
to find a market for their surplus. The country saw
their reeds and responded to their cry by land grants
and public loans and subsidies, liberal mail contracts
and other means, by -which the railroad system of the
country has developed to be the greatest, best and

Contrary to expectation the association
was confronted, miners were confronted
with a serious question as to Its consti
tutionality. It was not Just the law that
the miners wanted, but It was all that
they could pet and all that they had, the
speaker raid. Then the attitude of the
Anti-debris Association was described.
the speaker faying that the "time had
arrived to call a spade a ppade and to
meet the Issue fairly." At the first con
vention of the miners the representatives
of the Antl-debrls Association said that
Delegates wÂ«-rÂ« also present as follows:

ators and Congressmen 9. The cnmmlttpc
aiso recommended that eleven delegates,
rpprnsented by proxy, thou'.d be accredited
and this prevailed.
The real business oÂ£ the session came
up In the afternoon, when President Ral
ston. Secretary Benjamin, Treasurer S. J.
Hendy and the chairmen of the several
standing committees made their annum
reports.
President- Ralston said that he -was not
conscientiously able to report that any
thing very notable had Leen accomplished
during the year last past, but this was
<Jue only to lack of opportunity. He paid
tribute to the services of ex-President
N<*ff and said that "few men of California
could have carried us through the trying
times of our Infancy, with all Its trials
end with all the dangers and difficulties,
end to Mr. XeJf above all others we owt
a d"bt of gratitude." Continued applausÂ«
followed this acknowledgment, in which
all the miners took pait-
Mr. Ralston went on to welcome the
delegates from the Southwest Miners' As

ail were working toward one common end.

Ralston's address was loudly applauded.
Senator John F. Davis of Amador Coun
ty, chairman of the committee on legisla
tion, submitted a long report. He Â«,aid:
Some attention was paid by the presi
dent to the necessity of building up
branch associations In the counties. Any
county that wanted to have any topic
tauten up by the executive committee
could have that done by asking for a
meeting. If the representatives from the
counties did not come to express their
views they ought not to hold others re
sponsible. Compliments for good worÂ«c
were bestowed upon the secretary and
the treasurer and a salary for the secre
tary was recommended. The State Mining
Bureau ought to be maintained under tho
regular appropriation bill by the State
and not have to beg Its way from year
to year, the speaker said. The miners for
gold would not be jealous If the oil mlnera
made thÂ«Â»ir product equal the output of
gold. "The more oil you get the more
gold you will want." eaid Mr. Ralston.
"You can't put a barrel of oil in each
pocket and take in the sights of the city.
You want twenty-dollar pieces for these
little conveniences and we gold mineis
want to furnish them to you."
If It be proven unconstitutional make them
assist in framing and passing one that will be.
constitutional. Falling In this, we, should op
r<*e the expenditure of Federal or State money
In building barriers which will do the miner
no good whatever. The miner has had some
rights in this country. Mining is one of the
chief induftrleB of the State, and a. growin?
one. The miner has been but little considered,
but it In high time that he should be claiming
and demanding recognition in a State, the
basis and foundation of which was mining.
The** are my personal views, and the associa
tion is not responsible for them.
The president recounted the history of
recent troubles of the Hydraulic miners
who havp been enjoined. He wished the
Anti-debris Association, if honest, to slip
over the technicalities and try out the
whole act. He believed It to be the duty
of the Miners* Association to force the
hand of the Antl-debrls Association so
that the latter would be compelled to Join
In helping to prove the constitutionality
of the Carmlnetti act. Coninulng, he said:
You who are present know, as few otherg do,
the trials the, poor miners went through In the
early stages of this fight; how they had to
stand Idly by and be prevented from working
their claims to get food for themselves, their
wives and children. How the less influential
ones with small claims had to stand idle, and
y<Â»t see larger claims working aa usual; the
sr i<? 3 of the anti-debris men overlooking the
larger operations, while their eyes were upon
the smaller. This Is not pleasant to know or
to state, but it is true. The conduct of these
men with little claims waa that of honest,
law-abiding citizens. Tet, when the Hon.
Marion Biggs wanted an appropriation passed
to be used by a commission of Government
engineers, to report upon the amount of land
damaged or destroyed by hydraulic mining, a
United Statee Senator from California, who
made his first money in this State by "packing
grub to mining camps," stood upon the floor
of the Senate and wanted that appropriation
used by the Secretary of War to send regular
troops to the mountain? to stop hydraulic
mining. As I remarked before, these days are
passed, but we cannot forget them. At one of
our conventions we were of the opinion that
reace and good feeling reigned supreme, and
that our differences were all patched up; that
the lion and the lamb had lain down together.
Uut It appears now that the lion has swallowed
all of the lamb except his tall; but that may
bo found fu^of burrs and not very palatable.
We find that the men who said "all we. want
Is for hydraulic mining to be carried on under
Government restriction and control" coming
out in their true colors and protesting opalnst
ar.y and all hydraulic mining. And how do
they <\o this? By pleading a technicality con
o-rning the Issuance of a license from the
California Debris Commission. I ask you, fel
low miners, is this fair and Just? Is It honest,
square dealing?
- The California Miners' Association haa done
everything that It can to assist in obtaining
money from the State and Nation for the Im
provement of rivers by Impounding tailings or
by building impounding barriers to prevent the
tailings now In the etrrams from coming down,
and to permit of hydraulic mining above such
barriers. Now that the improvement looks to
bfi an accomplished fact and the miners havÂ«
â¢â¢been used" as far as possible, what do we
find?
they were anxious to see the hydraulic
miners resume work. They joined with
the miners in a memorial to Congress on
the basis of an agreement under which
hydraulicking was to go on under Govern
mental control. Later, when a conven
tion for the Improvement of rivers was
held at Sacramento the delegates of the
miners' convention, who went to confer,
wpre ignored. The delegates were, to say
the least, treated with scant courtesy.
That had passed, to be sure, and the
speaker said he only called it up to show
why he took his present position. Con
tinuing. Mr. Ralston s=ald:
John J. Moran. the tinsmith who threw
a spike through the window of J. llacow
sky's jewelry ptore on Kearny street,
near Sutter, Saturday afternoon, and
stole a watch, appeared before Judge Con-
Ian yesterday. Moran was held to answer
before- the Superior Court on a charge of
burglary, in $2000 bonds.
Cornelius Sweeney was held to answer
before the Superior Court by Judge Con-
Ian yesterday on a charge of burglary In
$1000 bonds.
T. C. Mathyas, mining engineer, charged
with assault with a deadly weapon, had
his case dismissed by Judge Mogan yes
terday. Mathyas was in a saloon at 4X9
Fourth street and John Herzog. a team
ster, amused himself by pulling his whis
kers. Mathyas became angry and took a
shot at Herzog. the bullet inflicting a
flesh wound in his leg. Herzog was will-
Ing not to prosecute If Mathyas paid for a
new suit of clothes for him, but the Judge
told him he had no right to annoy an old
man.
William Walker, the Los Angeles
paloon-keeper who cut Mllo Waldron. pro
prietor of the Majestic saloon. In the
Palmerlee lodging-house on Ellis street
early Saturday morning, appeared before
Judge Mogan yesterday on. the charge of
assault to murder. He was represented
by Attorney Percy Long. No complaint
was on file and Long moved that the case
be dismissed. The Judge denied the
motion and at the request of the prose
cution continued the case for a week, as
it was stated that Waldron would be con
fined to his bed for that time.
Is on File Denied and Case
Continued.

PCF.N'E TX GOLDEN GATE HALL YESTERDAY DURING THE FIRST
DAY OF THE NINTH ANNUAL SESSION OF THE CALIFORNIA MIN

The history of thÂ« North Bloomfleld lit

with definition of the duties and powers'

operating under a duly obtained permit.
Why the Issue waa'jw?Pt|K>ned was incom

anxious as the farmers to ascertain
whether they were moving In a fool's

declared. In conclusion Senator Davis

While a large number of permits to smaller
concerns have been issued by the commission,
no practical resumption of hydraulic mining on
any noteworthy scale has been had, and there
in the most palpable hesitancy by large con
cerns to Â«xpen<l large sums of money or -to
engage in large construction works under the
provisions of the law. What motive haÂ» held
back the expenditure of the public money thus
far appropriated we do not know. It is "up
to" the people having control of the expenditure
of these moneys to explain to the miners and
farmers of this State why next to nothing has
been thus far done. The hesitancy of private
capital, however, is perfectly comprehensible,
and the reason for it Is not far to find. Thor
oughly to apprehend the situation will neces
sitate a short reference tp. the history of the
present statute and to thei construction riven
it by the courts. u * Â°- J
Senator Davis discussed at length the
present Federal statute concerning hy
draulic mining In the Sacramento and
San Joaquln watersheds. He said thÂ«t
there was an unexplained hesitation In
the expenditure of money appropriated
bv Congress and by the Legislature for
the construction of restraining dams and
barriers. He continued:
The magnitude of the evil resulting from the
uncertainty of mlnins titles will perhaps be
appreciated when I say that after a residence
of seventeen years In the State of Nevada,
with the beat opwrtunlty of observing, I can
not at this moment recall a single Instance In
which the owners of really valuable mlnir.K
giound have escaped expensive litigation, ex
cept by paying a heavy blackmail. This defect
In the law. like the one concerning a want of
reasonable time to mark boundaries in making
a location, can be cured by aa amendment of
the law itself, and in this Instance your com
mittee make the name recommendation made
to Congress by the Public Land Commission In
ltSO. namely, the amending of the present law
eo that all future occupation. location or pur
chase of mineral lands shall be governed by
laws of Congress to the exclusion of all local
customs, rules and regulations and ail State
and Territorial law.
The third provision In the law In need of
amendment Is the provision In section 2324 con
cerning annual assessment work necessary to
hold the possessory right to a claim bm agalngl
the Government of the United States. ThÂ«
abuse of the present provision Is so persistent,
so flagrant and eo well known that It is need
less to describe It. Probably every man In
this convention has, at some time In his own
personal experience, been guilty of straining
tne 'present provision of the law upon this
subject. We all recognize the statute concern
ing annual assessment work as insufficient,
however, and most earnestly urge upon Con
rress such amendatory legislation In this re
gard that while It will provide a liberal sys
tem for the bona fide locator who holds and
works his claim in good faith, will still most
effectually and Incontinently work for the un
doing of every blackmailer and every dog la
the manger.
The points connected with this were
ably argued and then Davis went on to
say:
I am convinced, moreover, that the tainting
of every mining title In the land at Its very
inception with the uncertainty which results
fiom the actual or possible existence of rules
affecting Its validity, perfectly authentic evi
dence of which is nowhere to be. found, is a
stupendous evil. Experience has demonstrated
that such an uncertain state of the law is a
rrollflc source of litigation and no experience
Is required to convince any man of ordinary
intelligence that It must have the effect of
depreciating the value of all unpatented claims
by deterring the more prudent class of capi
talists from Investing In them. That the sub
ject Is simple enough to bÂ« embraced in one
ceneral law Is proved by the fact tha.t the
laws of the various districts, although differ
ing In details, are in substance Identical, and
are substantially contained in the existing acts
of Congress. â¢ â¢ â¢
Concerning the second point referred to
by the committee, the recognition in Fed
eral statutes of local rules, regulations
and customs of miners and State and Ter
ritorial laws concerning location of claims,
the committee reported in substance that
the whole subject of mining locations Is
an extremely simple one, which may eas
ily and therefore ought to be regulated
by one general law, the terms and ex
istence of which shall be established by
public and authentic records and not left
to be proved in every case by the oral
testimony of witnesses or by writing coh
talncd in loose papers or memorandum
books, such as are often dignified by the
name of mining records. Continuing Sen
ator Davis said:
In the requirements for the marking of ex
terior boundaries upon the ftronnd, under the
present provisions of ther.iaw. the rights of
the discoverer of a vein are not fully protected.
Unless he be given a reasonable time to mark
hi* boundaries upon the ground, either under
a State statute or a local rule or the decision
of the Supreme Court of the United States, he
may make manj- mistakes vital to his Inter
ests. As a mstter of fact th* trend of the
California decisions on this point Is against
him, though at the same time against the trend
of the decisions of almost all the other States
and Territories except Oregron. â¢ â¢ * We rec
ommend to Congress an amendment to section
2324 in this respect, drafted upon lines analo
gous to those In our late State statute repealed
in 1599.
The salient features of the sections referring: to
quartz mining are contained In sections 2319. 2320,
232* and 1324 and the legislation recommended
to Congrees by the committee refers to amend
ments of three of those four sections. The com
mittee recommended that these sections be
amended In three particulars: In the provls-
Uns concerning the marking of the exterior
boundaries on the irround: In the provisions
concerning the local rules, regulations anJ cus
toms of miners and State and Territorial stat
utes on location of claims and in the provis
ions concerning annual assessment work.

Suit on a Patent.
'Daniel Best filed a suit In the United
States Circuit Court yesterday against
Caton Foundry and Machine Company to
recover $6000 damages for alleged Infringe
ment of patent on an engine.
Mr. Swanberg expects to have the novr
plant in working order by the first of next
July. He says that the acquisition of
Hawaii and the Philippines has largely
increased the demand for cold storage,
and cites as an Illustration the fact thnt
L. A. Rostln. secretary of the, Honolulu
Market Company, has already engaged ail
the available cold storage space on the
Spreckels new line of steamers.
"If Bryan had been elected." says Mr.
Swanberg, "I would have abandoned the
enterprise and gone to Denmark, where
I have one of the largest dairy establish
ments on the Continent. The re-election
of McKlnley has assured men of business
that values will not be violently unset
tled."
C. O. Swanber*, president of the Mer
chants' Ice and Cold Storage Company,
has returned from an extended visit to
Europe with a large fund of knowledge as
to the latest Improvements In ice making
machinery and cold storage plants. He
has visited all the largest and most mod

many, France. Denmark. England and
America,' and has secured sufficient cap
ital to proceed with the erection of a

MODERN COLD
STORAGE PLANT
TO BE BUILT
Mr. Wright dealt first with the experi
ences of those who were seeking; the pas
sage of a bill through Congress providing
for a commission to classify the lands of
the State, so that no more mineral lands
would be patented to the railroad or to
others, under the guise of agricultural
land. Hla report of the work of the com
mittee was one of failures, for he said
that no matter which way the supporters
of the bill turned they found some tech
nicality or some objection that put oft its
passage until too late. In concluding this
part of hl3 report Mr. Wright recom
mended that "the association should con
tinue its support of the mineral lands bill
now before Congress, and to this end a
strong mineral lands committee shoUlU
be appointed, headed by some gentleman
able to give a large proportion of w his
time to the accomplishment of the asso
ciation's purposes."
Mr. Wright then took up the oil indus
try, and particularly the fight between
the "acrippcrs" and the locators. The dif
ficulty of. the oil locator he said was that
it is sometimes several weeks, and eveu
months, before he can tell whether or not
he Is on an oil producing claim, and In
the meantime the scrlpper can come in
and "select" the land under his scrip,
which entitles him to agricultural land
only. If the ecrippers would select un
appropriated lands where the presence of
mineral was not apparent, said Mr.
Wright, no one would question his right
to a patent, nor would his right to min
eral afterward discovered be questioned.
But in very many instances the scripper
has selected land within the well-known
limits of oil tields, lands known to him to
contain vast quantities of oil; and he ha?
even gone further and selected land upon
which derricks had been erected and upon
which wells were being sunk.
It was the purpose of the committee to
prepare a bill that would protect the oil
locator until he had either discovered oil
or nad demonstrated that there was no
oil on his claim. The bill provides that
locators shall have three months after
the markir.g of '.heir claims within whlcn
Jo begin work for the purpose of compiei
ing discoveryâ the discovery, if made, to
â¢.late back to the time of the location hi
order to secure a vor.tlr.iious title. It pro
vides further that so long as work is car
ried on with reasonable diugpnce ths lo
c:itor shall be protected, but if he fail to
prosecute the work dil'gently or if lie
fail to comn;tnce It within the three
months allowed, he shall forfeit his claim.
The nport of the secretary showed tho
association to be well equipped as t-j
members, and his report and that of the
treasurer showed that there is now on
hand to the credit of the association
$3208 65, with all bills paid. The disburse
ments during the year were $11,315 41; the
receipts were S11.215 41.
To-day W. B. Winn of the association
of oil men will probably present a series
of resolutions, expressing the satisfaction
of the oil men at the invitation of the
niners to unite In the Miners' Association,
and 'indorsing the bills providing for the
classification of lands and allowing dis
covery work upon an oil claim. Both of
tho'c were incntioned by Mr. Wright in
1:1s report from the committee on mineral
larVls.
The coimnt'on adjourned to meet this
morning at 10 o'clock.
the act shall bÂ« held to be constitutional, as
the miners are eatlsfled to take their chances
under it, they will have to suumlt to the Juris
diction of the commission, for otherwise their
hydraulic mining, no matter ho-w little Inju
rious, will be unlawful. They would then at
least have this much security In expending the
moneys necessary to take advantage of Its pro
visionsâthat they would run no danger of hav
ing the act declared unconstitutional over their
heads after they had spent their 1 money. If
the act shall be held unconstitutional then those
who have already submitted themselves to Its
Jurisdiction would cease ( expending further
money under It and can apply for the cancella
tion of their surrenders on the ground that
they were given without consideration.
Following: the report of the committee
on legislation came the report of the
committee on mineral lands, read by-
John M. Wright, chairman of the com
mittee.

One would hardly believe a militiaman

Even the insignia of law Is not sacred
to the pawnbroker, as Is evidenced by
the solid gold badge of Frank Wolf, onÂ©
time Deputy Sheriff In this city. The near
neighbor or this badge is a diamond affair
presented to Captain Frank Gregory by
Company D. Twenty-second Regiment,
away back in 1880. Hugging this latter
closely is the insignia in gold and precious
stones of Sir William H. Heck, past emi
nent commander of St. Mary's Comman
dery, No. 86, Knights Templars, whose
home in 1876 when he received It was in

won fame as the champion water walker

in goodly numbers. How they got Into
the hands of the pawnbroker mi?" t fur

One of the most curious things in the
collection is a German badge, from fifty
to seventy-five years old. It is of gold,
showing a star in the foreground, and
in between tho points, as a background,
is, represented the German eagle. A-re
markable circumstance about this decora
tion that has found its way across the
ocean only to rest among other pledges
Is that it is bestowed only upon members
of the royal family or upon renowned
generals of the empire who may win it
by deeds of unusual valor. On one star
point is a crown, and underneath a letter
"F," supposed to stand for Frederic. The
decoration also bears this inscription:
"Pour le merlte."
A pledge of equal or even greater rarity
is a large medallion of Jefferson Davis in
closed in a leather case. It has the in- ;
scription "Confederate States of Amer

"Cut everything down to the ; very
edge," said the old man, in a very busi
nesslike way. "There's a storm brewing.
Haul In sail. Stack up every dollar of
cash in the vaults that you can get your
hands on. Go into the money streets
and use the name of P. D. Armour for
all it is worth. Get every dollar to be
had, and then come back and tell me
about.it."
They all believed in their hearts that
the old man was setting panicky, but
they did exactly as he said. They pro
cured nearly $2,000,000.
"That's not nearly enough. Go out and
get more," he directed. "Don't be afraid.
Get every dollar you can, and get it Just
as quick as you can."
Finally they obtained $4,000,000 In cash,

up $8,000,000. â
"Now maybe we can weather It, said
Mr. Armour, and his preparations were
hardly completed before the crash of 1893
came.
One of the first things to happen in the
desperate financial straits was a run on
the biggest banks in Chicago. One morn
ing a messenger brought word that a mob
was lined up In front of the Illinois Trust
and Savings Bank, and that the peopls
were demanding their money. Some of
the most conservative business men had
lost their heads, and the rush was enough
to stagger any set of bank officials.
Ogden Armour, son of the old man, was
a director in the bank.
"This must be stopped," said P. D.
Armour.
"He waited a minute to arrange the
everyday bunch of roses In the horn vase
on his desk," said the man who told this
story.- "and then he snatched up his hat
and started for the bank."
Mr. Armour mingled with the crowd on
the sidewalk In front of the bank, going
first to one and then to another, pledging
his own credit for the deposits. He never
left the place until the closing hour, and
by that time the run had stopped. He
went back to his office and Issued a call
for a meeting of Chicago business men
the next morning. Then he cabled to
London and bought half a million dollars
in sold on his own account. He ate a
little luncheon and drove out to Armour
Institute that afternoon as usual. He
watched the classes at drill and then
inquired blandly, "Is anything wanted?"
On his way home to dinner he stopped at
the homes of his two sons for a little
-visit. After dinner he said that . he felt
a bit tired that evening, and couldn't ac
count for it.â Chicago Inter Ocean.
"How's business?" he asked, cheerful
ly, as he sat down !n the midst of the
powwow and within range of twenty

In 1SS2 the old man was on one of his
annual trips to the German mineral

BOSTON. Nov. 19.â While her father,
Edward Parker Deacon, now hopelessly
insane, drags out his weary days in the
McLean Asylum at "Waverly, Mass.,
beautiful 18-year-old Gladys Deacon has
become betrothed to Prince Lichtenstein,
a relative of Emperor William of Ger
many. For the first time in years people
in Parts, a letter from there states, are
talking of the Parker Deacons without
any more or less plainly expressed apolo
gies. The terrible tragedy of Deacon's
killing of Abeille. whom he had accused
of attentions to his wife, is forgotten In
the intensity of the American colony's In
terest in the romance.
The marriage of this beautiful young
girl, the oldest and loveliest of four
daughters, to a man of such rank and
standing as the young Prince will do much
to relieve the family from the scandal
â¢which has shrouded it ever since the fa
mous Deacon-Abeille tragedy ten years
ago.
After Deacon's trial for the murder of
Abeille there were numberless squabbles
over the four little girls. The result of
the first court decision was that the old
est child. Gladys, now soon to be Princess
Lichtenstein, was sent to a convent
where both parents might visit her. Dea
con then sued for divorce. Each made se
rious charges against the other. As the
outcome of It all Edward Parker Deacon
came back to America to live, while Mrs.
Deacon remained in Europe. Deacon be
came more and more unsound mentally
and was a few years ago committed to
the McLean Asylum at Waverly. It is
due to young Prince Lichtenstein that the
child of Edward Parker Deacon, her fath
er a maniac and her mother vowed to a
lifetime of expiation, for the first time
knows the meaning of happiness.

FROM PHILIPPINES
one until a few weeks ago>^when abun
dant evidence was brought forward as
proof that the mummy could not- be that
of any other Egyptian monarch except
Meneptah. It is to Georges Maspero, who
is generally considered the greatest
Egyptologist living, that the world is in
debted for the solution of this problem,
which has puzzled so many scholars for
centuries, since he has not only proved
that the mummy is that of Meneptah but
has also shown that it was this monarch
and no other who was drowned with his
army in the Red Sea.
As the guiding spirit of the Archaeolog
ical School at Cairo, he was naturally
much interested when he heard of the dis
covery of the ten royal mummies at
Luxor, and his Interest was intensified
when he learned that one of them was
supposed to be the mummy of Meneptah.
Being obliged to visit France, he took no
part In the discussion that ensued after
Gorff's identification, but on his return to
Cairo some weeks ago he sent for the
mummy, and when it reached him from
the burial place in Old Egypt he sum
moned the famous Egyptologists, Bruchfl
and Daressy, as well as Gorff himself, and
with them examined the royal mummy
most carefully.
The examination showed beyond the
shadow of a doubt that the mummy was
that of* Meneptah, for not only did Mas
pero find the name of that monarch
clearly written on the mummy but he also
discovered various other signs and hiero
glyphics which convinced him and his
companions that the grim looking object
lying on the table before them was actu
ally the corpse of the mighty monarch
who had been drowned with his entire
host while pursuing the children of Israel.
The second fragment originally formed
part of a colossal statue which stood at
the entrance of a temple in Luxor, and it
Is an admirable likeness of Meneptah.
The head Is covered -with the royal mitre
and in spite of some blemishes the coun
tenance retains all Its old majesty.
To tho world at large, and especially to
biblical students, the positive identifica
tion of this royal mummy as that of the
great Pharaoh is a matter of quite ex
ceptional interest and will surely tend
to give some additional value and charm
to the wonderful story told in the four
teenth chapter of Exodus.
In spite of Gorff's reputation as an au
thority on matters of this kind there were
several archaeologists who disagreed with
him, and the question remained an open
While excavations were being made at
Luxor some lime ago ten royal mummies
were discovered In the tomb of Ameno
phes II, and among them was one which
the discoverer after a rapid examination
ldentilicd as that of Amenopbes IV, who
is also known as Kun-Aten. Several
archaeologists in Cairo and other Eastern
cities heard of this discovery and went to
examine the mummy, the result being
that one of them, Gorff, a noted Egyptol
ogist, unhesitatingly maintained that It
was not that of Amenophes IV. but on
the contrary was that of Meneptah, who,
as already said, was the second Pharaoh
of the nineteenth dynasty, being the suc
cessor of Rameses I and the father of
Rameses II. who was known to the
Greeks under the name of Sesostris.
monarch, whose audacity in pursu
ing thÂ« children of Israel brought him
and his host to such an untimely end, and
it Is not surprising that biblical scholars
of all lajids have taken unusual pains to
learn all that they could about him. Their
first step naturally was to find out which
of the Pharaohs ho was. and many dis
cussions arose on this point. Some as
serted that it was Amazis, a distinguished
monarch of the twenty-third â¢ dynasty,
while others maintained that it was
Meneptah. the second Pharaoh of the
nineteenth dynasty. Thanks to a recent
discovery, this question can now be defi
nitely answered.

PLEDGES FOUND IN
A CURIO SHOP
Rare Family Relics Parted
From Their Original
â¢ Owners.
The Selt That Was Presented to Pro
fessor Hike O'Donovan by
THf: San Francisco .
Outside "of London and Paris there 1b
probably not a city in the world wheVe
such varied and unique collections can be
found as in the shops of the curio dealers
of New York, who make a business of
buying up articles at pawnbrokers' sales,
says the Times. If the pawnshops con
tain silent evidences of family and indi
vidual woes, the house of the curio dealer
has them multipled many fold, and with
them untold family histories, romances,
and even crimes.
Odd phases of human nature are often
revealed in the character of pledges, and
one of the oddest of these is often the
seeming indifference displayed by a nu
merous class who for various causes have
parted with gifts which have their names
engraved thereon. Just how and why
most of these articles find their way to
the curio dealer's shop before redistribu
tion to the general purchaser, once more
to go on their travels, Is a mystery which
no man may fathom. t
In a Bowery shop near Houston street,
where the proprietor, M. Rosenthal, buys
anything from a suit of clothes to family
relics, heirlooms and diamonds, are
pledges in one shape or another from all
parts of the world, and some of these date
back to the time of the Egyptian kings.
But, coming back to modern life, one of
the features of the collection Is the num
ber of trophies won by sporting men and
athletes, whose names are more or leas
familiar, and who have become separated
from their property, once proudly worn as
evidences of strength or skill.
A shining and conspicuous article !n the
collection from the pugilistic field is a
champion belt once belonging to Profes
sor O'Donovan, now instructor in ath
letics at the New York Athletic Club. The
belt Is a heavy solid silver affair, bearing
in front at the clasp an American shield,
flanked by the American and Irish flags

CINCINNATI, Nov. 19.â The experts
who have been working to-day with Re

National Bank at Newport, Ky., place the
shortage of Frank W. Brown, the missing
assistant cashier and individual book
keeper, at $191,000.
According to reports from those who
wore with Brown when he left last Tues
day night, he had less than $500 with him.
Brown's salary was only $1^00 per year.
Cases are cited where he spent more than
that amount in one day. His bond v.a_s

I>urirg the run on the German Nation
al Bank last Saturday $200,000 was secured
in Cincinnati to bridge over the trouble.
This was returned to-day and Receiver
Tucker had other moneys and papers also
transferred to Cincinnati.
Brown's system required a wonderful
memory. The experts say he carried In
his head the figures thst enabled him to
call off correctly a Jot of false entries In
a way to throw th* clerks who were do
ir.R the "checking" with him off the
track. A depositor would put in 13100.
lirown would *jiter the proper amount of
ih<> deposit in one book and enter It as
S100 in another. H* would take the differ
ence of $3000 himself. Then, when it came
to checking up he would handle one of the
books.
Another clerk would check and Brown
â¢would call off. Instead of calling off $100,
which appeared as the amount of the de
posit on the book which he was handling,
he would call it as $3100. thus making it
Â«. orrespond with the book In the hands of
th<? other clerk.
He also. It n> allege, worked It in
another way. A depositor would draw
out $100. Brown would make the proper

"WASHINGTON, Nov. 19.â The TJnlte.l
States Supreme Court to-day rendered an
opinion in the case of William B. Austin
vs. the State of Tennessee, involving the
validity of the State law regulating tho
sale of cigarettes.. Thu law was attacked
as an infringement of the right of Con
gress to regulate interstate commerce.
'"Die Tennessee Supreme Court upheld
th* law and to-day's decision sustained
that decision, though not without disap
proval of the positions taken, and then
on a very narrow margin, four out of nlnÂ«
members Joining- In a dissenting opinion
and another member of the court, Justice
White, placing his assent upon grounds
different from those announced by Justice
Brown, who handed down the opinion.
The case grew out of the importation of
cigarettes into Tennessee from North
Carolina. They were taken into the Stato
in the ordinary sized cigarette packages,
about two by four inches, and these pack
ages were loosely thrown into baskets,
which were uncovered.. The claim was
made that these cigarette packages were
what is known to the law as original
packages; but, without clearly defining
an original package, the court held that
It was clear that such packages could not
be so considered.
Justice Brown, In passing upon the case,
said that the packages were obviously
made up with the view of evading the
law, and as he spoke he held one of the
little cigarette cases up to tho view of
his auditors. â¢ On this point the decision
of the State court to ine effect that the
packages were not original was fully con
lirmed. On another phase of the case, the
State court was not so fully indorsed.
The Tennessee court had held that cigar
ettes are not an article of commerce.
With this view Justice Brown took Issue
and he delivered quite a dissertation upon
the subject. Whatever is an object of
barter and sale is, he said, an article of
commerce, and must be so recognized.
Tobacco had been such an article for four
hundred years. It had been made iho
subject of taxation and. indeed, had be
come more widely scattered than any
other vegetable growth. Probably,
he added, no other vegetable growth
has contributed so much to the
comfort and solace of the human
race. This being the case, it was entirely
beyond bounds to say that tobacco was
not an article of commerce.
Article of Commerce and
Must Be So Recog

2 Every mother possesses information of vital value to her
young daughter. That daughter is a precious legacy, and
* the responsibility for her future is largely in the hands of the
mother. The mysterious change that develops the thought-
less girl into the thoughtful woman should find the mother
on the watch day and night. As she cares for the physical
well-being of her daughter, so will the woman be, and her
children also. -
When the young girl's thoughts become sluggish, when
she experiences headaches, dizziness, faintness, and exhibits
an abnormal disposition to sleep, pains in the back and lower
limbs, eyes dim, desire for solitude, and a dislike for the
society of other girls, when she is a mystery to herself and
friends, then the mother should go to her aid promptly At
such a time the greatest aid to nature is X.ydla lÂ£ Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound. It prepares the young
system for the coming change, and is the surest reliance in
this hour of trial. "
The following letters from Miss Good are practical proof
of Mrs. Pinkhanrs efficient advice to young women.
Miss Good asks Mrs. Pinkham for Help.

Dear Mbs. Pinkham :âI have been very much bothered for some
time with my monthly periods being irregular. I will tell you all about
it, and put myself in your care, for I have heard so much of you. Each
month menstruation would become less and less, until it entirely stopped
for six months, and now it has stopped again. I have become very ner-
vous and of a very bad color. I am a young girl and have always had to

you would tell me what to do." â Miss Pearl Good

The Board of Public Works was author
ized to receive proposals and enter Into a
contract for sweeping the public streets
from January, 1501, to June 30. 1901, at a
cost of JGO.GOO.
Supervisor Wll3on called attention to
the fact that the board had no le?al right
to grant permission for spur track privi
leges, though many such privileges have
been granted in the past. Wilson quoted
the charter to show that the selling of a
franchise to the highest bidder was the
only manner in which the privilege could
be propÂ«rly gTanted. The question was
referred to the City Attorney after an or
dinance granting permission to the City
Warehouse Company to build a spur track
connecting with the belt road was de
feated.
The resolution granting permission to
the Presidio and Ferries Railroad Com
pany to set back temporarilv four feet the
south curb of Union street between Hyde
and Larkin was finally adopted. The res
olution provides that before the exercisfe
of the privilege the company must file a
bond for $10,000 that it will within five
years reconstruct its cable system and
will lay its tracks in the center of the
street named.
The City Attorney was requested to give
an opinion as to whether or not the city
may be charged with any of tne expense
Incurred in resetting the corner cesspools
and curbings of unaccepted streets or for
the performance of any other street work
on such streets; also what if any portion
of the expense must be borne by the prop
erty owners.
The ordinance authorizing- the Board of.
Public Works to dispose of all street ma
terial removed from t;he public street*
which Is unlit for further use thereon to
any department of the city government
desiring to use the material was finally
passed, notwithstanding that the charter
specifically provides that such material
must be removed to the corporation yard.
The Board of Public Works waa directed
to advertise for proposals and to enter
into a contract for the construction of
bunkers on the city lot at Eleventh and
Bryant streets for street sweepings, at an
estimated cost of $r.iÂ»5.

The New Yorker brought the letter to
the Sun office", and when he was informed
that it was part of a Spanish bunko came
he was disgusted and surprised. From
all over the United States have come
stories of victims of this fraud, but it
is evidently still a new Btory to many
people.
"A man came In here last week with a
similar letter and sent a cable dispatch.
It looks a bit queer. I think that I woull
Investigate If I were you."
"Is that letter from a Spanish officer In
prison who wants you to take care of his
daughter and his fortune T' asked the
manager.
"Yes." said the New Yorker. "How did
you know that?"
The Spanish bunko game, which has
been exposed frequently during the last
twenty years, lost a victim in this city
last week, by mere chance. The usual pre
liminary letter from the Spanish officer
who was In prison, offering one-quarter of
a fortune of J-50,000 to the recipient If he
would take care of bis daughter, now In a
convent, was received by a well-known
business man. The Spanish f officer, as
usual, explained that h'is mother had been
a distant relative of thi3 New Tork man.
and hence he appealed to him. He asked
the New Yorker to cable to his daughter
at an address in Spain If he would take
care of her. The New Yorker had never
heard of this bunko same and decided to
send the dispatch and see what came of
it. He went to the cable office and asked
the manager if there was such a place In
Spain as that mentioned In the letter.
The manager told him tnat there was, and
the New Yorker pulled out his letter to
make sure of the address.

JAMES D. PHELAN, Mayor.
If It is ccrr.retent fcr the charter to requlrw
the County C.erk aad Sheriff or any other offi
cial to r-as* examinations as to their fitness for
ofnee and be appointed by the Mayor or Board
of Fup^rvisor*. a? is confessedly true. It Â«eÂ»ms
absurd that the deputies in these offices cannot
be required to pa?s an examination as to their
CualiSeatlons. Hence the literal and narrow
construction of section SH of article XI of the
constitution Is something I believe the Supreme
Court wtU not uphold.
The only objects of the civil service provl
Â»ior.s cf the charter is to take the small places
in the City Hall out cf the glit of the politl
ciar.s who kII the recipients cf these offices
Into a po!iti<^al bondage. The men thus have
no protection ar.d are thrown out on the street.
BO matter how faithfully they serve, on a
change of administration. In fact, there la no
incentive whatever to faithful service ef the
public.
This decision of course affects only the so
called county officers and leaves civil service
Intact ia the Board of Public Works, Board of
Health. Election. Fire aad Police commissions.
Judre Cock decided that there was nothing ia
the law or constitution to prevent examina
tions for .these departments belnv held. The
very object of the people la adopting: section
?4 was to brlnr all the orfleei la a consolidated
city and county government under the civil
sen-ice provisions. The prcp!e voted for this
in rood faith, the charter-makers provided for
it in good faith and nrrw by technical construc
tion an attempt Is made to destroy It. We will
make a rood ft^ht and hope to recover the lost
ground ca cur appeal
"We pledge oar nominees for the different
city and ccunty offices to co-operate In the
strict observance of the letter and spirit of the
civil Â»ervlce provision of the new charter," and
the Republican platform read. "Our candidates
for all cf flees are pledged to rtrictly aad Im
partially enforce, the pravis'.ons of article XJII
upon civil service in the new charter." Instead
of this I have evidence that several of the offi
cers elected oa these platforms hare labored In
underhanded causer to restore ths spoilt sys
tem.
This <iuesticn should never have been raised.
but should have been acquiesced in. But now
thit Judge Hebbard has enjoined the Civil
Service Commission la conducting examinations
we â¢will consult with our attorneys and ascer
tain the best plan to pursue. Our object Is to
r*Â« an. expeditious hearts* by the Supreme
Court.
Every reform h*s a hard roaJ to tnveL In
thli case the spoilsmen ia the City Hail, cvAy
misfiful of their terrirorary poeltlooj, united
to defeat the civil eervice. I desire to call at

The ordinance directing: the Board of
Public Works to pave Clay, Sacramento
and ashington streets from Montgom
ery to Sansome and Pine street from "San
some to Battery with asphalt on a con
creta foundation was laid over for one
week. The Board of Public Works had
recommended an Inferior pavement of
bitumen on a basalt base Instead of on
a concrete base, as recommended by the
Street Committee, As the charter pro
vides that the Board of Public Works
must make the recommendation, the pav
ing of the streets named may be Indefi
nitely tied up.
The Board of Public "Works submitted
the following table, showing the cost of
paving the various streets named with
various pavements:
VThT-as, An undue amount of traffic from
thu business portions of that part of the city
east of Montgrraery street and north of Mar
ket street is diverted to Montgomery street on
the way to Market because of the smooth pave
ment of Montgomery street, thus often con
gfcsting that street with travel not natural to
it: and whereaj, the continuation of the pave
ment of Market street from Second to gutter
and Sansome streets will largely relieve the
said congeetion by opening up another route
of smooth pavement from the business portions
of the city to Market street via Saniosa* street
Xow, therefore, be It
Supervisor Reed, who evidently desires

The desire ot the Board of Supervisors
to pave a few streets before retiring from

The use of English approved by this

"only a phase of good manners."
Bad Englishâ that is. English onUkS

MGHT SCHOOL COURSE.
IE. HOW TO WRITE GOOD ENG-
l skilled, and thl3 Jumble of styles dees net
The feneral object of thi3 course is to
present in simple and practical form
some fundamental facts and principles
regarding the use of our mother tonsue
and the appreciation of its literature
which every intelligent person ought to
know. The special object of the first pa
pers will be to draw attention to some
common blunders, "and to show how to
avoid them. Before approaching, how
ever, the subject of blunders, it will be
well to define what is meant by "good
English," and to make clear the standard
by which tnÂ« "correctness" "or "incorrect
ness" of language should be judged. By
what authority do we say of a. certain
expression that it is "right" or. "wrong"?
Is it becausethe .makers of grammar say
it ought to be so, in the nature of
things? Or because the makers of dic
tionaries say it ought to be so. from the
history of ths expression? Or^hould we
look for the finai decision to soms other
tribunal?
Good English is the English used by the
best speakers and writers. Nothing more
and nothing less. And "bad English" is
simply English unlike that used by the
best speakers and writers. You observe
that nothing is said in this definition
about grammars or dictionaries. These
much-<iuoted books, though they nay
record good usage, have little or no in
fluence in determining It. Our language

ICEW YORK. Nov. 13.â The selling pressure
again proved more than the market could ab-
Borb and prices are very generally lower as a
result: There .are a few excertlons, both in the
railroad and Industrial dc-Dartments. but the
ctrength in thete few stocks was not free from
an appearance of manipulation by the bulls
for the purpose of sustaining the market and
encouraging renewed buying f or the advance.
The downward course of rrices promptly eet in
tfter the market had opened generally higher.
l^iEier money in London and the extent of the
advance ior Americans prompted some specu
lative venture :n that market and the stories
cabled from afcroad of greut Trunk Line con
Â¦OUOsucoa, showing that the rumor monger
had been regaling the liritith public with much
t-fce same kind or fare at that which has been
on Wall ttreet lor fcvme time past. The lower
prices here in New York attracted buying by
the arbitrage brokers, which served to sustain
the market, but on contir.uc-d evidence of de
pression London turned seller and liquidated
very heavily, the tales on balance being esti
mated at upward of 4'j.00<i shares. Selling from
domestic sources was also very large. Th*
railroads as a rule were mast affected and
many standard stocks were forced a point or
over below Saturday's level. In the late deai
lngs a ttrong demand developed for Northern
Pacific, which carried it up 2S to 6S*i. Great
Northern preferred rose easily an extreme S
points, but this rally, while it affected the mar
ket generally and drove the bears to cover, did
not hold, lung Flock coming out on the ad
vance. When the bears perceived this they
made a fresh attack and drove prices down
aeiiin. and while the level of the market did
not fall generally to the early low point, the
closing was active and easy. Among the points
d special strength should be mentioned Gen
era! Electric, Metropolitan Railway. American
Ice. Colorado Fuel and American Smelting: and
for a time Sugar and Brooklyn Transit. The
announcement of a failure of a board member
had some slight influence on sentiment until it
was learned to be of no Importance. There
was no actual ntws development to account for
the downward course of prices and it was
largely due to technical causes. The custom of
professionals to take the bear side of the mar
ket against a public bull proposition asserted
itself and there was muc!Â» 6olid opinion to be
heard that the rise In prices had overrun Itself
and that a reaction was overdue. The money
market was closely Ecanned for signs of dim
inishing resources. Call money hardened
slightly, but eased cflt analn In the late deal
ing*. New York exchange at Chicago also fell
from a tmall premium to a small discount.
The sterling exchange rate held Fteady in spite

easier rate in London. The supply of grain

CHICAGO, Nov. 19.â Wheat was active and
strong for a short time following the opening.
Considerable strength was shown by Liverpool,
where no strength was looked for. There was
a decrease on passage, which was unlooked for
also, and weather conditions were unfavorable,
although this is not much of a factor.
There were also smaller world shipments
than expected. At the start there was fair
buying by local professionals, with some ln
1 dications of covering by Saturday's shorts, al
though this did not at any time become promi
nent. Prices were irregular at the 1 opening,
but the market was quickly steadied by the
amount of wheat offered by commission houses,
and for some time the market held about the
top of the opening range. When the world's
visible figures were posted, however, the mar
ket quickly turned weak and for the rest of
the session the trend of prices was downward,
support toward the end being almost entirely
withdrawn from the market. The visible
showed an increase of 1,568,000 bushels. On
the decline early buyers offered freely, but :
found considerable difficulty in disposing of
their wheat. December wheat opened at 71%
@71*ic. compared with Saturday's closing price
of 7ivic It sold at 7l%c, then declined ir
regularly to 70*40, where it closed.
Corn was Irregular and active for November
and rather dull for the other months. The
opening in all options was firm with wheat
and on the unfavorable weather. Shortly after
the opening a Jump of nearly 4 cents took
place in November, due to fears of a equeeze,
shorts Fcrambllw? for the Infrequent offerings.
Corn came out freely at the top, however, the
leading selling being by the speculator who
Is said to control the situation, and prices de
clined rapidly. December, after showing firm
ness for a time, declined on the heavy visible

fympathy with the Greek- market, and are
about !^c lower. Demand for goods is more
patiEfactcry, but buying Is still for Immediate
wants almost entirely. California raisins are
very unsettled. Seeded are la good demand,
but loose are attracting almost no interest.
Prunes are steadier, both on spot and to ar
rive. Although ume goods are still to "be had
at cut prices there are fewer offerings of this
character than there have been. Buyers also
are disjjosed to take a little more intereci.
fcorce business is reported in apricots, but lt
Is not large. Peaches are quiet. Figs are very
taw, aÂ£ a result of the recent heavy arrivals.
The market is lower to-day than has ever
been kr.own at this season for similar grades
of fruit. The quality is unusually fine. Ap

CLOSING.
Money was easier. The market owed the
bank over Â£1,000,000, which was paid. Dis
counts weakened.
The marke.ts here were active and firm to
day, New York cables concerning the specula
tive and monetary position being regarded as
satisfactory. Americans were good during the
morning. The Continent sold a little, but many
American orders had to wait for execution.
London professionals continued purchasing after
your offering. You offered stock and London
nervously realized. Then you came to the res
cue, making the close above the worst. There
were wide fluctuations in Northern Pacifies and
Union Pacifies.

fully compiled statistics show that articles

shoes, and sillc and rubber roods, are
considerably cheaper now than they were

reduction of wages. The statement is
made officially that there were repairs
necessary to machinery which could only
be made when the works were- not run

Is very curious and Interesting to watch
the graduations by which the community
settles down to its day's work. By 3
o'clock the rush of traffic has become
something tremendous, and it grows by
leaps and bounds until It reaches a climax
at 10. From 9 to 10 the calls will often ex
ceed 4000. Then there la a slight falling
off, becoming more marked as the day
advances, and between 4 and 5 nine-tenths
of the business 'phones have subsided.
But, oddly enough, the residence 'phones
at that Juncture suddenly take up the
tale, and -their heaviest business is be
tween 4 and 6. I suppose the business
folks are through then* with the main
cares of the day and have a little leisure
for long-distance gossip. Throughout the
early evening calls don't vary much one
way or the other, and with 9 o'clock they
begin to dwindle steadily down to 1:30,

Between 1 andÂ§2 o'clock the calls will av

some reason I was never able to under
stand, business always picks up between
2 and 3 â In fact. It nearly doubles. Then,
for equally mysterious reasons, there !s
another lull, and the hour between 3 and 4

What time was not taken up by the dis
cussion of the plan of Supervisor R.oeth
for the taxin* of saloons Inside of cities
was taken up with the investigation of
the charges filed ajrainst the saloon con
ducted by Henry Fortune at Decoto. A
protest was filed against this saloon a
week agro and to-day there were a lot
of witnesses to testify that Fortune kept
a disreputable place. Nearly all of the
pijrners of the protest were present. Mrs.
Rosaria Enos testified that Fortune kept
a place where there were frequent drun
ken carousals. J. M. Hayes said that
h*s had seen little -fflrls In thÂ« saloon, and
Frank Mello. a *even-year-old boy. eald
that he had purchased whtaky. Mrs E
Martin, who lives across the street, said
that Fortune had u?ed vulrar lansruaic*
many different tlrn<*s. J. Peterson de
clared that Fortune had admitted that his
place did rot have a *ood reputation.
Snook & Church aDpeared for Fortune
and said that they did not expect to be
confronted with witnesses to-dav and as*.
ed that th*y be Riven till next Monday to
furnish witnesses a-Â« to the gwid renuta
tion of the place. Th!* was allowed.
Supervisor Roeth then wanted his reso
lution Instructing the Tax Collector to en
force the ordinance adopted. There was
no second to his resolution, and Super
visor Talcott moved that it be laid upon
the table, which motion was adopted bv
a vote of four to one, Roeth alone voting
"no."
Supervisor Wells said that he did not
think that it was necessary to pass the
resolution whereupon Roeth wanted to
know If Wells did not think tt the duty of
the License Collector to collect that li
cense. The Supervisor from the lower por
tion of the county replied that he did and
moved that a copy of the resolution lw
sent to the License Collector, which mo
tion was carried.
This merely throws the responsibility of
the entire matter upon the License Col
lector.
Where the ordinance of thÂ» county attempts
to provide police regulations, and they are in
conflict with the police regulations established
by any of the Incorporate! cities and towns,
such police regulations of the Incorporated
cities and towns ara superior to the police regu
lations provided fo4 by the ordinance of the
county. Respectfully submitted.

As each further item about bonds, divi
dends and construction accounts was pro
duced Hayne made objection and warn
arsrument. At each step of the proceed
ings the water company's lawyers were
fousrht. but th<Â» coart. following it^ orig
inal decision, allowed all of the figures to
er> upon the record. At adjournment the
'terns of construction were under In
quiry.
After Jndre Hart had given bis decision
President Watkinson was r*calleÂ«i and
the water company's attorneys started to
pet Into the evidence the figures on thÂ»
memoranda which the court . allowed
Watkinson to use. These Included a
tabulation of th# receiDts and expendi
tures of the company from the present
year back to 1S6S.
"It is a thing which ordinarily shoaM
not be done." replied Judge Hayne. "but
I consider when an advocate meets this
condition cf affairs it is his duty to de
nounce it. I say to the court with all
deference when that condition arises,
when ho sees an attempt to swear evi
dence In. It Is hts duty to denounce that
attempt In the strongest language."
Judge Hayne made light of Watkln
son's testimony that the books had been
destroyed without his consultation with
the board of directors, the governing body
of the corporation. .
Attorney McCutchen asserted that no
matter what the motive, the destruction
of the old books of account was not 11
lesai. He maintained that all of the cir
cumstances surrounding the burning" of
the books Indicated Innocence of motive
on the part of the company officials who
took part In the destruction.
"It is not justified . does no good and i3
unpleasant ia the trial of the case." said
his Honor.
Judge Hart Interrupted with a com
ment that he did not think Judge Hayne
should characterlza Dlnsref's and Wat
klnson's testimony as perjury.
"It is an Insult to our Intelligence for
them to say that they destroyed those
books because of lack of room and be
cause they did rot think it was wrong
to do so. Because one man goes oa the
stand and says that he did not know It
was wrong and another follows him on
the stand and doÂ«s likewise, it ia none
the. less deliberate perjury."
In a lengthy opinion Judge Hart said
ht could find nothing so far adduced, in
the evidence to show that the water com
pany had destroyed the books with any
intent to conceal facts connected with the
present litigation. His belief in that rÂ»
srard was based upon the fact that the
burning had been done a year before the
suit was brought. His Honor also heia
that the memoranda in question, cover
ing extracts made by Watkinson from the
burned records, had not been included in
the order he made allowing the city to
inspect the books and records. Judge Hart
=^id this data had been kept by Presi
dent Watkinson personally and that the
demands which the city experts had made
upon JDin^ee. Attorney McCutchen and
Former Secretary Beatie did not count,
because McCutchen and Dingee claimed
they did not know of the existence of the
important memoranda Watktnsoa had
kept and preserved.
JudgÂ» Hart said the evidence Â»a3 that
the experts had started to make a de
mand upon Watkinson when he replied
there was no use for them to make their
demands because the books had long be
for- been destroyed,. Then they went to
McCutchen and made a specific demaml
for all papers which represented extract*
cr entries from the burned records, but
the demand was turned off on tne plea
that neither the attorney, Dinzee nor
Beatie knew of the existence of this Wat
kinson memoranda. And upon this state
ment Judge Hart summed up as follows:
"Now If It should have appeared la this
record that those papers were in exist
ence and that a demand for inspection
had been made upon the proper person
and refused, the court would be JuÂ«U!e<J
In excluding them on the ground of will
ful concealment."
When Hayne took up the argument this
morning he said:
"Suppose there were records in those
books of the corrupt use of money and
that they did not want these to become
known. Suppose that the books showe>l
money spent for legal services' which
were not proper. Could they then be held
to have destroyed the books innocently
when they wanted to conceal these mat
ters from the public*?

Before Judge Hart had ruled to-day
that he found no fraudulent purpose in
the burning of the books of the Contra
Costa Water Company. Attorney Hayn-?
had another fling at the testimony of
President Watkinaon and Vice President
Din^ee about their reasons for destroy
ing the records. Hayne reiterated his be
lief that the reasons which had been given
were untrue and absurd.

Cannibals Execute War Dance.
The cannibal crew of the Mascotte, at
Howard-street plrr No. 3, entertained a
number of friends of tne vessel's owners
yesterday. They executed a war dance
on the deck of the ship and the queer
contortions and yells furnished amuse
ment for- the large crowd that gathered.
The cannibals were, perhaps, as much en
tertained as any of. the spectators, as the
exhibition of American dress and new
faces was new to them and considerably
different from what they were accustomed
to In the islands.

CAPTAIN" BURCH of the British
ship Cawdor, which arrived late
Sunday night from Newcastle, N.
S. W.; tells of a narrow escape
his vessel had from colliding near
the Australian coast with the schooner
Golden Shore. A hurricane was raging
when the ships nearly came together and
a big wave wnich came along at the op
portune moment averted a disaster. The
Golden Shore I* owned in San Francisco
and was lumber laden.
The Cawdor was in ballast and a gale
arose. In a few hours its fury became
terrible. Captain Burch soon realized the
folly of sailing in such a sea and every
yard of canvas was stripped from the
masts. There was nothing to do but
drift, and'this the ship did for some time.
Soon the bare masts of the schooner Gol
den Shore hove in sight, she also drifting
rapidly in the storm. < Â¦
As the phips neared one another their
positions became perilous. The terrified
crews were unable to control them and
looked for nothing- but the sinking of one
or both of tho vessels. The Cawdor bore
straight down toward the big schooner
with a force that meant destruction.
But a fow seconds more and the vessels
would have crashed together had not
something that filled ' the sailors with
wonder occurred. A great wave, as If
conscience stricken) iose between the
craft and turned the nose of the CawCor
Just enough to prevent the crash that
seemed unavoidable. She just missed the
Golden Shore. So close were the vessels
as the ship flew broadside by the schooner
that one could have jumped from the
Cawdor to the Golden Shore, Captain
Burch says.
When the. vessels slipped by one another
a cheer -went up from a hundred voices.
The Golden Shore drifted on, but in the
distance it was- seen that she had turnea
completely around. She is bound for
Puget Sound ar>d is expected to arrive
there shortly, after which she will come
to this port. It is not known to what ex
tent she suffered In the storm. The Caw
dor was uninjured.
BIO PRICE FOB LIGHTSHIPS.
Be Made.
Survey of the Steamship Olga Will
Much difficulty has been experienced in
obtaining a substitute for the lightship
which has been taken from outside
the Heads and is now under repair.
Since the Ol&a went on the beach
near the Cliff House the lightship's
absence has been the subject of
much discussion In marine circles and
every effort has been- made to fit up an
other vessel to take its place. The own
ers of several schooners were consulted,
but their terms proved to be very unsatis
factory. The prices asked ranged from
$60 to $100 a day and the limited appropria
tion made for coast lightships would not
stand such a pressure.
To-day a survey of the ship Olga will
be made with a view of ascertaining tho
amount of damage done to her when she
grounded. Since the accident she has
been discharging cargo at the sugar re
finery and the pumps nave been kept con
stantly at work. There is no perceptible
damage to the machinery and all of the
sugar taken out thus far has been In fair
condition.
The French bark BourbaW, which wan
grounded near the Heads some time ago-,
is still in the drydock at the Union Iron
Works. It will require five new plates to
repair the damage she sustained and tho
work will cost her. owners $5000. Pilot
Reed, who had charge of the vessel when
she went ashore and who was suspended,
has been reinstated. The cause of tho
accident is ' attributed to a faulty com
pass. i

The burglar who entered the residence
of Internal Revenue Collector Lynch at
Berkeley on the night of November 10
and stole about $500 worth of silverware
is locked up in the City Prison. He was
arrested yesterday on Washington street,
near Sanaome, by Detectives Wren and
Dinan. Secreted on his person was a por
tion of the plunder he stole from the
Lynch residence. A loaded revolver was
found in his Inside coat pocket.
After being taken to the City Prison
the burglar was put through the sweating
process, but beyond giving his name as
Harry Johnson and claiming that he had
recently arrived from Indiana he re
fused to say anything. Captain of Detec
tives Seymour is satisfied that Johnson Is
the desperate housebreaker who has been
operating throughout the country. In
his room hi the King House on Fourth
street the detectives found a brace and
bit, a "Jimmy" and several files.
Part of the plunder recovered by the
detectives from various pawnshops, where
it had been disposed of by Johnson, was
last night Identified as the property of
Mrs. M. Gillian of 12 Leibrandt avenue,
Santa Cruz.
On the night of October 1 a burglar en
tered her home and got away with a lot
of silverware, a banjo and a valuable
Japanese knife. The stolen property wai
found in a Third-street pawnshop, wherii
It had been sold by Johnson, together with
some other stuff.
Johnson's method in disposing of ni*
plunder was â¢ to visit a pawnshop and
after showing the pawnbroker several
pieces of silverware, ask him what they
were worth. He would then tell a story
of how he had bought the silverware for
his best girl, but as she had transferred
her affections to another, he decided to
sell the stuff, expecting to get a little
less than he had paid for It. In this mln
ner he got rid of nearly all his plunder.
The police are satisfied that Johnson, as
he calls himself, Is an Eastern crook, with
a long criminal record. His Dlcture will
be sent East to-day in the hope that it
will be recognized and his identity thus
established.

HAVANA. Nov. 19.â Only flfty-stx cases
of yellow fever are now under treatment.
Among these are two Americans. The
disease is abating rapidly in Havana.
Captain of Detectives Seymour and his
men are trying to unravel the mystery of
a girl b< ing found in her room with a bed
Ehec-t tied arcund her neck and a white
subFtance resembling poison sprinkled on
the coverlet. The girl's name Is Alice Du
Pointer. Her parents conduct the Nevada
lodging house at 907 Folsom street.
Shortly after 7 o'clock Sunday evening
the girl's father returned home and was
Burpxised to find that his trunk had been
broken open and $5 in silver r^d a light
overcoat taken. He at once reported his
loss to th? police at the Southern station
and two officer? were sent to make an
Investigation. They in^pe^^d the prem
ises, but Called to get a clew to the per
petrator of the crime.
S<?v<-rs.l liours later, fhortly after the
family had retired for the night. Mr. and
Mrs. Du Pointer were suddenly awakened
by the screams of their l&-year-old
<Jaupht<-r. who occupied the adjoining
room. Jumping out of b*-d they rushed
to ber room and and found the girl fran
tically endravoring to untie the 'bed
Fheet which was wound around her neck.
Mr. Du Poister hastily untied the sheet,
and noticing the suspicious white sub
Â«tnno<? on the coverlet concluded that his
tfaugrhtor hr.d been given somÂ«* of the
Fuppopfd poison, and as It had no per-
ceptible effect the "villain" in the case
had tried to strangle her.
The girl at first pretended that she was
unable to Â«=peak, but under the soothing
caresses of her anxious mother, she gave
free rein to her tongue. She claimed that
shortly after midnight she was rudely
awakened by somebody, who after tyli:g
one end of the sheet around her neck,
sprinkled some "white powder" on the
bed. She declared that she did not see
the person, but thought It was the same
man who broke open her father's trunk
and stole his money and overcoat.
Detective O'Dea, who was detailed on
the case by Captain Seymour, is satisfied
that the girl broke open the trunk and
to protect herself tied the sheet around
her neck and sprinkled the poison, which,
after being analyzed, was found to be
sugar of lead, on the red. O'Dea claims
that he arrested the girl about three years
ago for stealing a gold ring from another
girl. After a trial, however, she was dis
charged.
SAYS A STRANGE MAN
TRIED TO STRANGLE HER
Peculiar Tale Told by Alice Du Poister
Is Doubted by Police.
C. W. Smith of the Reddlngton Drug
Company yesterday swore to a warrant
charging Clara McCann, who lives on
Bryant street, near Sixth, with attempted
extortion. The warrant was issued by
Judge Cabantss and at once given to De
tective Cody to serve. Up to a late hour
last night, however, the woman had not
been arrested.
Smith finally became tired of being ha
rassed by the woman and consulted Cap
tain of Detectives Seymour, with the re-

he has been considerably annoyed of late
by the woman. On several occasions she
visited his place of business, and after
pretending that she held a secret concern

well in print demanded money. Failing
to make him disgorge, she abandoned her
visits to his store and stared to hold him

Smith says he never met the woman un

short time ago and tried to blackmail him.
He Intends to vigorously prosecute her in
case she does not elude the police.
This is not the first time that the Mc-

C. W. Smith Swears Out Warrant for
Arrest of Clara McCann.
MOST of the plays which our late
most un-American of managers
Dalylzed from the German are
the merest farces, whose orig
inal humor, seldom very sub
stantial, has been attenuated almost to
nothingness by the denationalizing trowel
of the adapter. To this statement "The
Railroad of Lcve," presented last night
at the Alcazar Theater. Is an exception.
This play of Von Schonthau's Is really a
comedy which Mr. Daly's literary hack,
in a lucid Interval, failed to "adapt" and
merely translated, with a change of the
characters' names. The result Is a pro
duct decidedly superior to such a Dalylza
tlon as "The Last "Word"â a product that
calls for close observation and delicate
appreciation of shades of meaning on the
part of those called upon to interpret It. I
went to the Alcazar Theater last night
with fear and trembling, for I remem
bered "The Strange Adventures of Miss
Brown" and the horrors of "The Country
Wife." I came away with a feeling that
I had witnessed a performance that would
have done credit to almost any stock
company in the country. To Mr. Bryant,
the stage marager. is due. I am sure,
some of the credit for having kept the
comedy from falling into the rut of farce,
while some is due also to the Intelligence,
grace and refinement of the new leading
lady. Miss Convere. The part of Mrs.
Osprey, played by her, gives the tone to
the piece; had she struck a low pitch,
every other part would, of necessity, have
been lowered to correspond. But nothing
of this kind happened and the result was
correspondingly happy. Mr. Hajl. as the
lady killing lieutenant, was clever and
convincing, though it is rather a long
step for him from romantic drama to
light, modern comedy. Mr. Emey sub
dued better than formerly his tendency to
overact and was well within the picture.
Miss Howe and Mr. Montalne were good,
as they always are. As Swift, It is said,
could write beautifully even about a
broomstick, so, I am sure, could the ex
cellent Montalne, if necessary, act even
a stationary ghost so as to make you be
lieve It was walking..
Altogether, a decidedly enjoyable per
formance and all for the ridiculous sum
of fifty centsâ a performance better than
many you will see in New York for two
dollars. L. DU PONT SYLE.
Tivoli.
Merry music and merry maids, and a
merry house of merry blades, with laugh
i ter loud and much hand cheer, received
"The Jolly Musketeer." And when before
the footlights came. 1 our own Ted Hart
man blest of fame, the house rose up with
wild applause that lasted minutes without
pause. But just as warm a greeting met
Miss Annie Myers, the bright soubrette;
these two exponents of pure fun insure
the piece a four weeks' run. Miss Wil
liams sang and played Yvette with sim
ple grace and need not fret, for critics she
has all disarmed: and they will praise
whom she has charmed.
Another new one that can't fail Is
Francois-Mr. Tenbrook Dale. The hero
of jthe play alone he courts Yvette in
barytone, ' and tho' Salassa's voice was
stronger, Salassa's salary, too, was longer.
But Tenbrook'a singing hits the spot; 'tis
light and graceful, and I wot that every
night his voice he shows a greater favor
ite will disclose. Full tide of humor, flood
and ebb, are seen In Mr. Edward Webb;
with belly round and goggle eyes he
proves a very glad surprise," and he and
Ted together run and win the lively race
tor fun. With these ' few j rhymes thfs
screed must close or taper gently into
prose. Â¦ â¢ Â¦ â¢ '- Â¦ "
Ferris Hartman and Annie Myers should
be proud of the. warm California greeting
they received from a house packed from
the orchestra to the back skylights. The

back the two old Tivoli favorites. Annie

conception and execution of the role of

enthusiastic admirers. As for Ferris, he
was at his best. -He Is one of the few
eingers whose articulation is all that can
be desired. Fun bubbles out of him like
soda water from a spring â easily and nat
urally.
Maud Williams," the leading lady. Is tall,
good-looking and graceful. She has a
sweet voice and one that is all sufficient
for the role, and her acting last night left
nothing to be "desired. Mr. Dale's . bary
tone, while not strong and rotund, is
pleasing, and he made a good appearance
in the role of Francois. It was a severe
test to put upon him to appear just after
such splendid singers as Salassa and Fer
rari, but he withstood it as well as could
be expected. Mr. Webb was very funny.
The chorus was well drilled and the cos
tumes gorgeous.
The Royal Marine Band presented an
excellent programme at the California
Theater last night. The "piece de resist
ance" was the fantasie from Herbert's
"The Singing Girl." with Incidental solos.

received by a large audience. Those who
do. not hear this band miss one of the
greatest musical treats ever offered in
this city.
The bill at the Orpheum this week is a
most attractive one and among the new
comers there are some who are more
than usually entertaining and amusing,
lone MacLouth made her bow to the
vaudeville stage and met with a most
flattering reception. She is a young girl
of much promise and her singing is
marked with rare expression and feeling.
She was particularly happy In the songs
'Comln' Through the Rye" and "Annie
Laurie," and was warmlv applauded for
her efforts. She will doubtless be a great
success in vaudeville. Max Waldron.the fe
male character impersonators clever and
graceful and at once established himself as
a prime favorite . Sie Conditt and Lillian
Morey give a touching sketch, "The Ties
that Bind," and it had the merit of draw
ing tears to the eyes of the ladies. It is
full of pathos and the characters of the
patient and manly husband and fretful
wife are admirably portrayed by the two
artists. The Brothers Martine are clever
acrobats and Stelllng and Revelle are
amusing and unique as horizontal bar
artists. The holdoversâ James F. Dolan
and Ida Lenharr, W. J. Hynes, Mr. and
airs. Dan HIatt and Anna Boydâ were as
entertaining as ever.
Alhambra.
Lovers of Hoyt's farces who stay away
from the Alhambra miss a treat. "A
Stranger In New York," presented by a
capable company, occupies the boards at
the theater this week and is presented In
a more than pleasing manner. John Ij.
Kearney as the "stranger" is a surprise
to the audience, carrying the difficult
Hoyt character through In a thorough
manner. To the McCoy sisters, however,
and Sam Marion Is due the success of the
performance. These lively people keep
the audience convulsed with laughter.
The other people In the cast are up to
the standard.
Fischer's Concert House.
The programme at Fischer's Concert
house was almost entirely new last night
and every number was warmly applauded
by a large audience. Argyle Tully, a
pleasing ballad singer, made his first ap
pearance here and scored a hit, as dldalso
Helen Stuart, a transformation dancer.
Irene Franklin received several encores
for her cornet solos and Olive Vail, bal
ladlst, repeated her success of some
months ago. Ouhama proved to be a
wonderful Japanese equilibrist, and Harry
H. Walton, Chinese impersonator, repeat
ed his amusing act of last week. Little
Claire Fex changed her specialties and
the moving pictures are new. Hinrichs"
orchestra played a varied and interesting
programme.
Chutes.
Nora Bayes, the phenomenal contralto,
scored a big hit at the Chutes last nighi.
Other good numbers on the bill are Gus
Leonard, the odd musician: Shields
brothers, bicycle experts; Leandor broth
ers, gladiatorial acrobats; Little Alma,
child artist; Hunt's dog circus. Cannon,
the fat man. In poses plastlques. and new
moving pictures.
Olympia.
The new bill this week at the Olympta
Is a good one. Mabel Hudson is a clever
performer and the rest of the programme
was well received last night and r.hould
insure good attendances for the rest of
the week.
Managers' Charity Fund Benefit.
The sale of seats for the second annual
benefit In aid of the charity fund of the
Associated Theatrical Managers of ,San
Francisco, to be held at the Orpheum,
Thursday afternoon, opened yesterday
morning with a long line in attendanceâ
a line that remained unbroken all day.
Hundreds of good seats are still left, how
ever, but it behooves those' who desire to
see the monster show to purchase to-day.
Yesterday afternoon the committee ar
ranged the programme in such a way
that every artist will have just the place
on the bill desiredâ a task that was far
from easy. There will be nineteen
"turns" presented, ranging from numbers
by principals from the Maurice Grau
Opera Company to the latest up-to-date
vaudeville acts.
Slgnor Gaudenzlo Salassa was suddenly
summoned to Italy yesterday, but his
place will be filled by Signor Vittorlo
Emanuele Castellano, tenor of the Tlvoll
Grand Opera Company.
The doors will be opened at noon and
the performance will . commence at 1
o'clock sharp. There will be no Intermis
sions, and it will be nearly 6 o'clock be
fore the curtain finally falls.
Alice Neilson Coining.
The opening of Alice Neilsen's engage
ment at the Columbia Theater next Mon
day night will serve to Introduce that
prima donna for the first time as a star,
before her own townspeople, and It Is her
desire to appear before them In the best
possible light that has brought about a
very expensive move on the part of her
management.
To those unacquainted with the average
route land out for companies touring the
West there does not seem any obstacle In
their reaching In due time the various
towns at which they are to appear. But
the desirable and important towns are few
and far between this side of the Rockies.
â¢ Miss Nellsen and her company, were
originally booked to appear at Salt Lake,
Thursday, Friday and Saturday of this
week, and she was to have left that city
Saturday after the evening performance.
After due consideration of the situation
Miss Nellsen decided that she could not
appear in the leading role of "The Sing
ing Girl" at the Columbia next Monday
night Immediately after landing from, the
train. So she. canceled her Saturday book-
Ings in Salt Lake and will arrive In this
city Sunday morning In a special train
with her large company, numbering over
ninety people. This step Miss Nellsen has
taken is a very expensive one and means
the loss of a great amount of money, but
when the 'pretty young actress decides
upon a thing money Is no object. Sev
eral theatrical men stated yesterday that
Miss Neilsen made a very wise decision,
as she carries a largo amount of scenery,
and if she should arrive here late the
stage hands would not have time to ar
range the scenic effects properly. Ar
riving on Sunday the company will have
a cha/ice to rehearse and the "first night
ers" will have the opportunity of seeing
Miss Neilsen and her support at their
very best. -

clever little Italian company, who were

which the opera so faithfully presents.

company had been playing in Mexico,
where everything goes â and we had the

pathetically well fitted by circumstances
for the opera's Interpretation.
The orchestra was amazingly good, the
principals really excellent, but the chorus!
ohime the chorus! how well I remember
it! Gathered in from the hedges and the
highways of the Latin Quarter, from the
big-eyed bambinosâ whose mothers must
bring them to the theater for there was
no one else to care for the little onesâ to
the aged grandam whose sweet, old Ital
ian voice still had a worth-while note
In It. The scenic accessories were on a
par with the appearance of the chorus,
but there was heart, and life, and genius
in the performance just the same, as one
gladly felt them in the air last night,
under how different circumstances!
"La Boheme" is a brilliant, vivid, scin
tillating sort of thing, modern as Wag
ner, but at opposite poles â realistic as he
is realistic, and swiftly picturesque as
Wagner is reposefully romantic. Puccini
never by any chance prolongs the musical
expression beyond the limits of the dra
matic moment. Rather does the move
ment occasionally suggest unfinished mu
sical thought. Its legitimate expression
denied climax in compliance with the
dramatic exigencies, while oppositely
Wagner will often prolong the dramatic
situation beyond all reasonable limit to
allow to his musical idea its full fruit of
development. "La Boheme" has the same
saving lack of set solo, trio, quartet and
the rest of it, as has the Wagnerian mu
sic, and represents the last word so far
of the modern Italian school.
The opera received a delightful Interpre
tation last night. It had just the right
tone-coloring, accent, feeling. Melba is a
charming Mimi. She sings and acts the
part with a pathetic grace that touches
the heart and brings tears to the eyes.
"Mlmi! Mlml!" shouted the audience at
the third scene's close, where she bldj
farewell to her poet-lover, and VMlml!"
again.
It is an unusual part for Melba. In this
regard. No sort of opportunity does the
role offer for the lovely vocal gymnastics
of which she. is so perfect a mistress; it
Is pure, straight, dramatic singing and
the artist here achieves another triumph
In her admirable art of simplicity.
The part of Musetta served to introduce
another of Mr. Grau's singers. Miss Fritzi
EchefT, and a pretty and dainty little so
prano. Miss Scheff's voice Is light, but
sweet, and she gave a chic and charming
portrait of the little grisette. strange
brilliant flower of the life of the Latin
quarter.
Mr. Cremonini had a grateful part aa
Itudolfo, lover of Mlmi. He Bang with
much feeling and acted ; ell. more espe
cially in the scene of Mimi's death, which
was a fine dramatic movement. The part
also suits him vocally.
Campanari did the Marcello and was
well suited in the role. Mr. Gilllbert.
whose first hearing here was last evening,
raised a pleasant barytone In Bchaun
ard's part, but, dear me! he looks like
two starved musicians, not one! Mr.
Journet's good bass was heard in the part
of Colllne, and Dufriche and Maseiro
completed the cast.
The audience was a little afraid of it
self in the matter of expressed enthusi
asm at first. The atmosphere of "Bo
hemia" lacks dignity, except in its trage
dies, and the audience, unaccustomed to
demand upon its risible arrangements in
grand opera roused only to a rather
doubtful and condescending applause at
first. But when the diamonds and dol
lars were forgotten in the pitiful, small
Joys and troubles of the brave Bohemians,
the house was ready with its tears and
laughter In fullest need.
Xot a soul lifted hat or coat till the
curtain rang downâ they were forgotten
in the tragedy of a garret. The atmos
phere was very genuine. The sale of Col
line's coat appeared a veritable sacrifice,
the mock duel with tongs and poker a
spontaneous Jest, and the picturesque
crowd In the Latin quarter Just what
it purported to be. It was a delightful
show all round, and one Is glad to know
It will be given again during Jthe season.
To-night "Don Giovanni" will be heard,
with Nordica, Frutzl Scheff, Gadskl, de
Reszke, Scottl and others In the notable
cast.
