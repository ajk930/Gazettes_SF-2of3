Nothing !s known here of any purpose
on the part of Russia to act Independently

An official pointed out to-day that Russa
had Joined with France In submitting pro
rogate presented as a basis of negotiations
end that several weeks ago M. de Wollant,
In accordance with an instruction from
his Government, had specifically declared
the purposes of Russia in China, which
included "maintenance of a common
egreement among the powers; mainten
ance of the former state of organization
in China; removal of everything that
couid lead to the rartltlon of t.ie Celestial
tmplre, and the establishment with the
united powers of a legal central govern
nent at Peking, able alone to preserve
order and tranqulllty In the country." In
view of this declaration the authorities
are inclined to discredit all the report*
showing a policy different from what It
prescribes.

The dispatch announced the acceptance

dent Mitchell can only be conjectured. It
is believed here that no order to return
will be issued until a notice similar to or
in line with that of the Reading and Le
high companies Is posted at all the mines.
The Reading Company's notice reads:
"It hereby withdraws the notice posted
October 3, 1900, and to bring about practi
cal uniformity in the advance of wages in
the several coal regions gives notice that
It will suspend the operation of the slid
ing scale, will pay 10 per. cent. advance on
September wages until' April 1, 1901, and
thereafter ; untlf-: fuiÂ»her : notice will take
up with the mine employes any grievances
which they may have."
No formal announcement has yet beÂ«n
made by the Lehigh Valley Reilroad Com
pany regarding Its Intentions, but after
the Reading Company's statement had
been rrjade public Vice President Garrett
of the Lehigh Valley said:
"Concerning our operations in the
Schuylkill region, you may say that the
action of our company will be similar to
that of the Reading Company. In other
districts, however, certain conditions ex
istâfor Instance, the price of powder â
which must be treated separately, and we
have not decided definitely with regard
to them. These matters are now in the
hands of Superintendent Lethrop, whose
headquarters are at Wllkesbarre."
Calvin Pardee & Co., extensive Individ
ual operators in the Hazleton district, late
thia afternoon announced that they will
post to-morrow notices similar to that of
the Reading Company. This undoubtedly
indicates what all the Individual operators
will do.
NEWS SPREADS RAPIDLY.

HAZLETON. Pa., Oct. 17.â The news
from Philadelphia to-day that' the Phila

pany after a conference with officials of
other mining companies had agreed to ihe
anthracite miners' proposition brought
forth many expressions of surprise that
It should come so soon after the conven
tion of Saturday last. President Mitchell
of the United Mine Workers, when in
formed of the Reading Company's action,
declined to say whether the union would
let the men return to work at the col
lieries where the operators had accepted
the miners' proposition before all the com
panies had fallen into line. It Is generally
believed that the big coal -carrying rail

the Reading Company and grant accept

operators will do the same.

LED THE STRIKERS ON TO
VICTORY.
PHILADELPHIA. Oct. 17.â The
great strike of the anthracite
mine workers of Pennsylvania,
which began September 17, prac
tically ended to-day, when the
Philadelphia and Heading Coal and Iron
Company and the Lehigh Valley Coal
Company agreed to abolish the sliding
scale in their respective regions and to
grant an advance in wages of 10 per cent
net, the advance to remain in operation
until April 1. 1991. or thereafter. This ac
tion meets the demands of the Scranton
Miners' Convention. The decision was ar
rived at after a conference between rep
resentatives of the different coal opera
tors and the large coal carrying compa
nies. The conference began yesterday.
To-day's action was the culmination of
the recent meeting- of the individual op
erators at Scranton following the mine
workers' convention in the same city.
Nearly all the collieries in the coal region
had previous to the mine workers' con
vention posted the notices of-ihe advance
of 10 per cent. The mine workers, in con
sidering this, demanded that the sliding
scale in the Lehigh and Schuylkill dis
tricts be abolished, the Increase to be
guaranteed to April 1, 1901, and all other
differences to be submitted to arbitration
The individual operators agreed to every
thing and the appointment of a commit
tee to Induce the, Reading and Lehigh
companies to abolish the sliding scale and
make the wage increase permanent fol
lowed. It is conceded that the result of
to-day's conference is a complete victory
for the men. All the demands of their
convention are acceded to, and, as one of
the individual operators put it 'after the
conference, the operators go a. little fur
ther by agreeing to maintain the wage
advance after April 1. This same opera
tor, who requested that his name be not
used, said in speaking of the conference:
"It Is up to the miners now. "We have
agreed to everything and nothing remains
now but for them to return to work as
soon as the notices are posted by the col-
All the big companies and individual operators in the anthracite coal fields of Pennsylvania
have agreed to grant the demands of the Scranton convention, including anadvance of 10 per cent in
wages and the abolition of the Eliding scale. The big strike, which was inaugurated on the 17th ult., is
therefore practically ended, and the -workers are expected to resume their labors next Monday.
The first companies In the Hazleton dis
trict to take action similar to that of the
Reading Company were Galvin, Pardee
& Co., operating the Lattimer collieries,
and A. Pardee & Co.. owners of the Cran
berry mines, both of them individual con
cerns.
These companies will reduce the price
of powder from $2 75 to $1 50, which re
duction is to be considered In arriving at
a net increase in wages.
The news from Philadelphia spread
through the entire region with almost
lightning rapidity. Everywhere satisfac
tion was expressed by the striking miners
and others. It is believed that the strike
will be officially declared off. .this week
and that all the men will have a chance
to return to work on Monday.

This was a day of triumph for Roose

similar demonstration ever made here.
There was an Immense parade, consisting
of half a score of brass bands and dozens
of political organizations, Including many
which had come hither from other places
to do honor to the candidate for Vice
President. Superior street, the chief thor
oughfare through which the parade
passed, was ablaze with electric lights,
suspended In loops crosswise and length
wise from tall pillars surmounted by
flaming globes and decorated with ever
green. Along the brilliant course thou
sands of brilliant rockets and flambeaus
flared. The walks were thronged with
men, women and children, who drew so

that the Cramps Shipbuilding Company

campaign fund four years ago. It also
charges that Senator Hanna bought his

Senator Hanna has studiously avoided

â¢WASHINGTON'. Oct. 17.â In his annual
report Engineer-In-Chief Melville urges an
appropriation of $1,000,000 for a GOOO-ton re
pair ship on the plan of the Vulcan, but
Improved in detail. The force of engineer
inspectors is said to be entirely insuffi
cient and it is suggested that some of the
younger line officers might be detailed
to this duty with much benefit to them
selves as well as to the service.
The englneer-In-chiaf makes a strong
argument against the proposed consolida
tion of naval bureaus, pointing out tha*
in every large shipbuilding plant the bu
reau system prevails, to a more complete
separation of the special branches of
work than is practiced In the navy. Ships
of war are of such construction, in his
opinion, that It would not be safe to trust
their design to any one man, with tho
prospect of his carrying out thereon his
particular fads or experiments. There
tore, he argues, the members of the
present Board of Construction are neces
sary advisers to the Secretary of the
Navy and he asks the Secretary to with
draw the recommendation made by him
to the last Congress for a consolidation.
The cngineer-in-cnief expresses the
opinion that the personnel bill was either
a mistake or the proper course has not
been taken to carry out its Intent.
The condition' of the steam engi
neering interests of the navy is
Bald to bÂ© even less satisfactory
than last year and It is urged
that In no other way can relief be ob
tained than by the immediate assignment
to duty, as understudies and assistants to
the experienced engineers In the navy the
younger line officers in as great numbers
as consistent with other duty. It Uj
claimed that success already has attended
the assignment of line officers to such
duties and that the practice should be ex
tended. As a matter of fact there are
now available 100 less engineer officers
than Just prior to the passage of the per
sonnel bill, which act was Intended to in
crease their numbers. â¢- .;,.â¢â¢Â£ Â¦â¢-Â¦
The suggestion Is made that naval
cadets be trained In engineering aboard
the Cincinnati or the Raleigh after these
vessels are thoroughly modernized. A con
siderable increase is wanted in the num
ber Of warrant machinists who have given
general satisfaction. The estimates for
the various navy yards and stations are
as follows: " ' Â¦
New York. #56.523: Norfolk, $434,956; Bos
ton, $276,323; Mare Island, $352,525; League

MELVILLE WANTS
NEW REPAIR SHIP
BERLIN, Oct. 17.-The Kolnlsche Zei
tung asserts that Prince Hohenlohe has
tendered his resignation as Imperial
Chancellor, and it has been accepted.
According to the same authority Em
peror William has designated as the retir
ing Chancellor's successor Count von
Bulow, Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Although rumors had been current for
several days that Prince Hohenlohe in
tended to retire, little credence was given
to any of them, since such reports had
returned periodically for several years
past.
The fact is that neither the Foreign
Ornce nor any other Government depart
ment in Berlin knew until this evening of
Prince Hohenlohe's retirement and Em
peror William's, approval of It. The rea
sons which induced the Prince to insist
upon retiring were, in the main, his rapldly
growing Infirmities and his distinct disap
proval of the Emperor's personal policy in
China. To his intimate friends Prince
Hohenlohe, during the last three months,
has repeatedly expressed strong criti
cisms upon what he has called the
"Kaiser's sentimental and impulsive In
terference In the troubles In China."
The Kolnlsche Zeitung asserts that
Count von Bulow has also been appointed
Prussian Minister and Foreign Minister.
Xothing Is known positively about Prince
Hohenlohe's successor, although general,
credence Is given to the assertions of the
Kolnische Zeitung respecting Count von
Bulow. The Berliner Tageblatt mentions
Prince Eulenberg, German Embassador
at Vienna, Prince Hohenlohe Langen
burg. the stadtholder at Straesburg, and
Duke Trechenberg as possible successors
of the Chancellorship. Count Hatzfeldt,
German Embassador in London, is also
named. It is suggested that If Count von
Bulow become Chancellor Prince Eulen
berg might be assigned to the Foreign
Office.
Prince Was Opposed to the
Kaiser's Attitude on the
Chinese Question.

NEW YORK. Oct. 17.â Albert T. Patrick
and Charles K. Jones, counsel and servant
for William M. Rice, were again before
Magistrate Brann to-day for the contin
uation of the examination of the charge
of having forged the signature to a check
for $25,000 drawn on the banking firm of
Swenson & Sons.
Assistant District Attorney Osborne
brought up the affidavit of Walter O.
Wetherbee, a clerk of Swenson & Sons.
In the affidavit Mr. Wetherbee recount3
the details of a conversation he had with
Charles P. Jones last January. At that
time, the affidavit reports, Jones proposed
a scheme for making away with the es
tate of Mr. Rice. After a lengthy argu
ment between counsel. Magistrate Brann
said he would admit the evidence. Weth
erbee said that in January last he saw
Jones by appointment at Rice's house and
met him by appointment a second time
at his (Wetherbee's) house In Brooklyn,
at which time Jones told him that Rice
accused witness of stealing a $1000 bond..
Jones then said to witness: "I have a
proposition to make to you. Do you
know that I have old man Rice's will?"
Witness replied that he did not know
the contents of the will, but that he saw
Rice sign it. Jones told witness certain
portions of the will. He said witness was
one of the trustees and that the will pro
vided for a bequest of $&),000 to Fred A.
Rice and his wife of Texas, the residue to
go to William M. Rice Jr. Jones also
named the executors, and said if wit
ness would consent to a second will he
could put witness In. Jones wanted wit
ness to substitute himself In the new will
for Judge Bartine. one of the executors
of the old will. Jones said Rice was at
times "Dopey," and that he could get him
to sign any paper he wanted to. Jones,
the witness testified, promised to divide
with him if he did as suggested regarding
the drafting of a second will.
"Witness said he had made an affidavit
on March 21. which is in substance what
he related to-day. On cross-examination
by Mr. House, the witness said he did not
object to- Jones' proposition at the time it
was made, nor did he tell Mr. Rice about
It. because he was acting under the advice
of counsel. But when Jones asked witness
to draw up another will and make Mr. Co
hen of Texas an executor and substitute
his name for that of Judge Bartine wit
ness told Jones he was not In that kind
of business.
"Did Jones intimate to you that he
would forge the old man's name to any
paper?" asked House.
"No; he said that when Rice came out
of his 'dopey' condition he could slip a
paper under his hand and he would
sign it."
Mr. Wetherbee was still on the witness
stand "when the hearing was suspended
for the day.

LONDON, Oct. 17.â At the meeting of
the Chartered Bank of India, Australia
and China to-day the president referred
to the bank's important interests in the
Philippines and said he viewed with
equanimity the transfer of the islands to
the United States, as he anticipated "An
glo-Saxon vigor would create a strong
government, crush the rebellion and foster
commerce."
Referring to the Indian currency, the
president said the problem was still un
solved. He added that although the de
sired steadiness in exchange was fairly
maintained the supply of rupees, in. the
absence of internal demand for y gold,
proved insufficient and the authorities
were compelled to purchase nearly four
million sterling worth of bar silver during
the current year In order to increase the
circulation. The profit on this would yield
the Government a surplus of a million
and a half. But whether such an ad
dition to the revenue was desirable, from
an economic standpoint, was debatable.
"Financiers in London, who have
watched the gold movements in the
United States with keen interest, not un
mixed with anxiety," he continued, "were
convinced that no more gold was likely
to be drawn from England. It was cal
culated here that seventeen and a half
millions of dollars in gold had gone or
was going to the United States. The last
of this amount was coming from Austra
lia next week. London bankers, basing
their theory on America's legal reserve
of 25 per cent, say the gold in or on its
way to America should enable all the im
mediate requirements to be met, and
should more gold be needed the Bank of.
France is ready to ship to the United
States. But it Is not believed the Bank of
France will be asked for any large
amounts. ' These caJculations"are responsi
ble for the drop in London discount and
the talk of a decreased bank rate. At the
same time the authorities seem to believe
that the balance of trade will remain in
America's favor, but that It will not be
drawn In gold sterling bills, perhaps
stocks being taken instead of specie."
' The president admitted that the "profes
sional element in Europe has so unloaded
itself of American securities that It can
not meet large obligations, as It used to,
by the return of American stocks.
"The gold now on its way from South
Africa to New York," the president fur
ther remarked, "does not come from any
secret hoard, but represents soldiers' sav
ings and expenditures, for which five mil
lions In gold have been sent from England
and the major part of which Is likely to
seek circulation in other parts of the
world." .... Â». Â¦

CALL. BUREAU, WELLINGTON
HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Oct. IT.-In re
sponse to an instruction from the State
Department, made at the instance of a
resident of California. Consul Greener at
Vladivostok has forwarded a report on
the fruit market in Siberia.
Siberians, as a rule, he says, are not
great consumers of lemons, nor do they
use them in tea as much as may be iiiÂ£
custom in Central Russia, cream having
come into general use by the importation
of condensed milk from the United States.
France and Switzerland.
Most of the lemons, raisins, figs, honey,
olives, olive oil, oranges and nuts im
ported come from Europe via Odessa. All
of these are brought by steamer, usually
carefully packed, and at a. cheaper rate
than could be given by Pacific Coa?t raerÂ»
chants.
California products have already been
introduced, says Consul Greener, by sev
cr*J of the larger Jlrms, especially the
canned fruits, which are in great favor.
There seems to be a preference for our
foods of this character; but high freights,
delays In receipt of goods and bred pack
ing have done much to injure American
trace.
Several persons have been here within
the last two years looking for openings
for California fruit; but after examining
the field they seem not to have considerel
the outlook favorable.
Some lemor.s arid raisins come from the
United States. Xlg-s and olives from Italy
and France and a little honey from Rus
sia, Â¦while wines come from Russia and
orarpes and nuts from China <.CheiuÂ»
and Japan. No fruit from China. Japan
or Manchuria compares with that culti
vated in the I'nitcd Statos, and if it
were possible to put our leading fruits
into this market I believe it would prove
to he not only a blessing to the people but
a commercial success. But all depend? on
low rate* of freight. <ju:ck transit and
proper packl:is;.
Th<Â» principal trade markets of Siberia,
are Vladivostok, the southern terminus of
the I'ssurl Railway line, 475 miles from
Habarofsk, the n^rthr-rn terminus and the
capital of the Amur province, situate.! at
the Junction of the Amur and Sungarl
rivers. N'ikolaefsk. the first principal
town in Eastern Siberia, is reached from
Vladivostok either by pea or by the Amur
River. Between Habarofsk and Vladivo-
Ftok is the important town of Xikolksk-
Ussuri. the eastern end of the new Si
berian line. Blasrovestchensk. the most
Important Inland town of Eastern Siberia
ip about half way between Habarofsk and
Stretensk, a *rood thousand miles from
Habarofsk. There is a larce business
community here and American poods are
widely used. From Vladivostok to Xiko
laefsk Is from five to ten days" sail; from
Vladivostok to Nikolksk-l'ssuri about
four hours by rail; from Vladivostok to
Habarcffk. tome thirty hours: from Ha
barof.sk. by steamer, to BlaRovestchensk,
from five to ten days, according to the
condition of the river. Transportation fa
cilities are good. There are two lines of

Commissioners Are Now
Preparing a Report for
Congress. \
While No Definite Decision Has Been
R3 ached, the Nicaragua Route
Seems to Be the Most \
Favored.
CALL BUREAU, WELLINGTON
HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Oct. 17.-The
Isthmian Canal Commission is a^ work
on its report, but it is evident' that it will
llnd it Impossible to do more than submit
a" preliminary statement to Congress
when Lhe session begins. This report will
present facts and figures referring to both
t the Panama canal and Nicaragua routes.
JA vote has not been taken by the com
j mission as to which it will recommend,
i nor will a decision be reached until fur-
I ther information has been received re-
I garding both projects.
M. Hutin, president of the Panama Ca
nal Company, arrived in Washington to
day and paid his respects to the commis
sion. He came to Washington in com
pliance with the request of Rear Admiral
Walker and will stay as long as business
engagements will permit, when he wiH re
turn to Paris. He will come back to
Washington during the session of Con
! gress. Notwithstanding the fact that the
commission has not taken a vote as to the
1 route, it is apparent from the trend of its
i investigations that it favors the Nicara
gua waterway. Because of the dimensions
and displacement of modern steamships it
has been determined that a canal thirty
! feet deep would l5o too small, and the com-
I mission is preparing estimates on a canal
I which shall be thirty-rive feet in depth
i and have a minimum width of 159 feet,
i On the thirty-foot canal the majority of
the first Walker commission estimated
the cost at about $123,000,000. The increase
in depth and width projected will necessar
ily make the projected canal more expen
sive. Borings are being made to ascertain
if the increased excavation necessary will
require the removal of rock or soft dirt.
The advocates of the Nicaragua canal are
getting considerable comfort out of the
tact that the examination of the route
recommended by the first Walker com
mission has, except in a few instances,
shown its entire practicability. Engineer
ing parties sent out by the Isthmian Com
mission have gone over every foot of the
route. They have recommended that the
sites of several locks be slightly changed
and the commission will adopt their rec
ommendation. The general Impression
seems to be that the commission will fa
vor the Walker route provided that bor
ings being made for the larger canal
should not show that the cost would be
excessive.

KELSEYVILLE. Oct. 17.â Evidence of
the apathy of the Democrats In the Third
District and the half-hearted way in
which they are carrying on the campaign
was supplied here to-night. Hon. Frank
Freeman, candidate for Congress, was to
have addressed the people of Kelseyville,
but failed to make .his appearance. In his
stead Burdette Cornell of Oakland ad
dressed a small crowd.
The speaker declared "imperialism was
the paramount Issue, because that issue
would be settled by the coming election.
He distinguished between "imperialism
and "expansion." claiming that the Dem
ocratic party stood for expansion now as
always. Expansion, he urged, carried the
constitution with the flag. He said the
McKinley administration sought to make
subjects of the Filipinos instead of citi
zens. A brief reference to the trusts con
cluded his remarks.^

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 17.â Los Angeles'
ambition to have a city charter to suit
her size and requirements has met disap
pointment. The Supreme Court, sitting In
bank to-day, handed down an opinion that
the Board of Freeholders cannot legally,
form a new charter. The opinion was
given in the test case brought by J. H.
Blanchard against City Treasurer W. A.
Hartwell. The court holds that such a
charter can be changed only by amend
ment submitted by the legislative author
ity of this city, as provided In section 8
of file 11 of the constitution. The labors
of the Board of Freeholders, which had
almost reached the end of its task, there
fore are set at naught for the time being
at least.
The court's ' decision Is a great disap
pointment to those who for years have>
realized the inadequacy and faults of the
present charter. The City Council might
consider the new charter as drafted* by
the now defunct freeholders and submit it
to the people as an amendment to the
present charter, but it is feared that with
such fatherhood It would be a partisan
political creation and would fall to obtain
the necessary three-fifths vote-

PER3X0US VOYAGE OF
THE CHARLES D. LANE
Only the Presence of an Expert Boiler-
Maker as a Passenger Pre-
vents Disaster.
PORT TOWNSEND, Oct. 17.â After a
tempestuous voyage, marked by a thor
ough breakdown of the motive power, an
overloading of passengers and a scarcity
of provisions', the steamship Charles D.
Lane reached Port Townsend to-day, sev
enteen days from Nome. Several times
during the journey it looked as if the end
had come, and passengers and crew agree
that they owe their salvation to the fact
that an expert boiler-maker, Mr. Molan
der of Port Townsend, was aboard. The
boilers of the Lane leaked so badly as to
extinguish the nres and make an explo
sion imminent.
For three and a half days the vessel,
was tossed about on the angry waves of

SAX JOSE. Oct. 17.â An epidemic for di
vorce seems to have struck the upper
strata of San Jose's society. -During the
last sixty days a score or more divorce
suits have been brought, in which well
known church and society people are the
principals. An addition to this little col
ony of "marital malcontents" was made
to-day.
Edith Harter filed a suit for divorce
from Clinton A\\ Harter on the grounds of
failure to provide and neglect. Mrs. Har
ter was formerly Edith Kea, daughter of
James \V. Kea, the well-known politician.
The couple were married in Visalia in
IS?-}, and the wedding was a swell soclety
affair. There is one child, and the mother
wants the custody of it-
For the last year Mr. and Mrs. Harter
fhave resided in San Jose, where the wife
Is a great social favorue. Harter is al
leged to have basked around in the sun
shine on the Ftreet corners and neglected
his wife and child. Mrs. Harter tired of
this treatment, and a few months ago
took up her residence at the home of her
uncle. The defendant is now in San Fran
cisco. It Is not expected he will make
any contest.

On Sunday the sport will begin with the
first round of the consolation, and then
the two stakes will alternate until the
completion of both. There will be no draw
for' the consolation, the courses following
the order in which the dogs were beaten.
This is how the dogs were drawn for
the John Grace stake, showing the owner
as well as the nominator:
In order to accommodate the crowds a
special train service has been arranged.
On Saturday trains will leave Third and
Townsend streets at 11 a. m.and 1 p. m.
On Sunday the trains will leave at 9:15,
10:15 and 11 a. m., 12 m. and 1 and 2 p. m.
The sixty-four dogs entered are win
ners of many a handsome prize on many
a hard-fought tield. .according to the
terms of the stake, members of the Inter
state Coursing Club have the right to
nominate two dogs, but this does not pre
clude an owner from having other dogs
in the stake as long as they are nomi
nated by other members. The entrance
fee was $50.
Consolation stakeâ Winner, $200; runner-up,

â¢ The draw for the great John Grace
challenge cup which will be run on Sat
urday and Sunday at Union Coursing
Park was held last night at Pythian Hall.
This event, easily the foremost on the
American coursing books, both on ac
count of the quality of the dogs entered
and the magnitude of the prizes, will
eclipse everything of its kind ever plan
ned in this country.
Al! told $6610 will be distributed among
the owners who have entered hounds in
this stake event. The principal stake, the
John Grace, will carry $5400 In prizes; the
consolation $1210. It was originally plan
ned to divide tne JG610 among the lucky
ones in a single stake by offering spe
cials which would swell the $5400 to the
full stake figures. But the dog owners fa
vored a consolation and the Interstate
Coursing ""Club fell In line with their
wishes, fixing the consolation stake as
the consumer of the extra prize money.
The prizes in detalW^re as follows:.

V. Oddle. Chairman of the Regatta Com
mittee S. Nicholson Kane, ex-Commodore

and Cuptain C. Oliver Iselin.
As Boon as the committeemen were

challenge of Sir Thomas was formally ac
cepted on behalf of the club. At the con
clusion of the committee meeting the fol
lowing cablegram was sent to H. C.

"Meeting committee held. Your chal
lenge accepted. Conditions same as they
stood at the close of last- year's races, in
cluding private agreement as to accidents

Special Dispatch to The Call.
"The third race to be sailed on Satur

'â¢Further races, if. any, to be sailed upon

"I, therefore, on bGhalf of the lloyal
Ulster Yacht Club and In the name of
Sir Thomas J. Lipton. rear commodore of
tho club, challenge to sail a series of
matches with tho yacht Shamrock II
against any one yacht or vessel construct
ed in the Lnlted States of America for the
America's cup.
"Following are the particulars of the
challenging vessel:
"Owner. Sir Thomas J. Lipton.
"Name of yacht. Shamrock II.
"Length of load water line, S9.5 feet.
"Hig, cutter.
"The custom-house measurement will
follow as soon as the vessel can be meas
ured for registration."
It was ascertained that the important
matter of building a new boat to defend
the cup was not officially considered.
â¢ There will be a boat built." said lead
ing members, and while little could be
gleaoeO regarding tho possible owner of
the vessel that is required, there were
rumors in the air that Cornelius Vander
bilt would be the one to act. No better
opportunity will ever to had for one of
the younger members of the c.'ub to estab
lish an international yachting reputation.

Hear Admiral Hlchborn, chief construc

make the new Shamrock speedier Ameri
can yacht builders should be able to butld
a yacht faster than the Columbia, Speak
ing to-day of what may be expected from
American yacht builders, Admiral Hich
born said:
"The time Intervening between the last
race for the America's cup and the race
now contemplated has not boen lost by
our designers. The 70-foot 'Yankee class 1
which were hulk by the Herreshoff Manu
facturing Company and which were so
tnoroughiy tried in many competitions
during last summer has kept the minds
or yachtsmen and designers nlort to take
advantage of any possible improvements
If n-hen the trials of Shamrocks No 1
and No. 2 /ire held It Is found that the last
boat is better than the first I believe that
our designers will be able to Improve on
tho Columbia or build an improved Co

the cup.
SIR THOMAS UPTON, THE GALLANT ENGLISH SPORTSMAN. WHO IS
WILLING TO SPEND HIS ENTIRE FORTUNE TO LIFT THE AMER
ICA'S CUP, FOR WHICH HE AGAIN CHALLENGES,
Court adjourned until to-morrow.
Youtsey's condition to-night is much
worse. He had another paroxysm and Is
unable to take nourishment except hypo
dermlcally.
The defense closed nere, with permis
sion to put on one more witness to-mor
row. The commonwealth began Its re
buttal by putting William Ayers on the
stand. He said Short did tell him all that
Short admitted, and also told him that
the insult to Kohn and Phelps before tho
contest board the night before Guebel's
assassination was prearranged ana part
of the plan to bring on a riot.
He turned to answer the question and
found It was Youtsey who had asked it.
He said he did not b:.Â« Youtsey enter the.
room.
James Howard testified that he was the
game Howard who was recently tried and
convicted for the murder of William Goe
bel: that he never saw Youtsey in his life
to know him; never had any talk at any
tlmg with Youtsey, nor did he accompany
Youtsey to any place or room anywhere
at any time; that he was not In Caleb
Powers" office jon the morning of January
30 or in any other room in that building
on that morning. On cross-examination
he said he had been convicted of murder-
Ing George Baker of Clay County, had
secured a new. trial and went to Frank
fort on January 30 to secure a pardon
from Taylor; that he was in the Board of
Trade Hotel when Goobel was shot.
IV. J. .Davidson of Seattle and Mrs. C.
E. Nelson of Cnicago testified through
affidavits for the delense. Davidson said
the leaving of a gun by Youtsey In his
omce on January u7 had no reference to
any attempt to kill Goebel or any one else.
airs. Nelson Bald sne saw Youtsey on
tfffi fast steps of the executive building
Â¦so soon after the shooting that he could
not have taken part In It.
C W. Short of Pinevllle said he was In
the barber shop under the executive build
ing when the shots were tired and that
immediately after the shot some one bo
hind him asked, "Did you hear that Bhoot
lne'.' Where was It?"
James Ktnney and Lee Jenkins of
Georgetown testified that they had made
the test and found that while running
down the steps into the basement of trio
executive building a man's footfalls can
not be heard In the barber shop with
either the door open or shut.
The defense got In some strong testl
mony to-day, equarely contradicting the
prosecution's witnesses.
The feature of the day was the testi
mony of Colonel Nelson, one of Youtsey's
attorneys, who denied that he had told
Arthur Goebel and Colonel Campbell that
"Youtsey knew enough to hang: Governor
Taylor," but admitted that he did say his
client (Youtsey) knew "something that
would be very beneticial to the common
wealth In the prosecution of Taylor."
The prosecution argued from this that
if Youtsey thus admitted that he did
know something damaging to Taylor, he
mu?t necessarily know other details of
the tragedy.
GEORGETOWN. Ky., Oct. 17.â The de
fense In the Youtsey trial closed its case
late tills afternoon and the commonwealth
began its rebuttal testimony, which will
likely be concluded to-morrow at noon.
YoutFey's condition was materially im
proved to-day, though he still remains In
a stupor most of the time.

Great Audience
at Metropolitan
Temple.
ONE of the greatest audiences that
has assembled at any meeting In
San Francisco during this cam
paign gathered in Metropolitan
Temple last night. It was the
magic of Stephen M. White's name that
brought the multitude together, for the
former Senator was billed to speak. Dis
appointment was in store for them, for
through a misunderstanding White did
not come north from Los Angeles. Wil
am H. Alford was substituted and he de
livered a speech that held the close at
tention of the audience and very few left
without hearing him to the end.
K. t*. Troy announced that there had
?r ee ?Â«-Â£ mlsunders tanding as to Stephen
M. \\ hite s engagement. Tho former Sen
ator had been in telephonic communica
tion from Los Angeles with the State
Central Committee in the course of the
"a- y and it had been arranged that he
should speak in San Francisco Saturday
night. Mr. Troy then introduced John J.
\ alentine as the chairman of the even
ing and after a campaign song by Miss
Etta Walsh Mr. Valentine introduced Mr.
Alford, who spoke In part as follows:
Industrial freedom Is impossible so long as
a trust exists. We hear our Republican friends
say that there are grood and bad trusts. Mr.
Harma says there are "no trusts except the ice
elave. John Sherman was right when he said
that through the trusts there would soon be a
maMer to fix the price of every necessity of

that never has a powerful nation fallen except
by the indifference of the people to evils at a
time when they mlsht have been remedied.

the power of its enemies but in the lndlJTer

The speaker was Introduced by the pres
ident of the club, George W. Lewis, who
also addressed the audience on the issues
of the day, telling them that the nation's
prosperity lay with the present adminis
tration.
Other speakers were Maxwell McNutt,
who delivered a short but telling arraign
ment of political bunko men; I. Golden,
Â¦who related how the flag had been fought
for step by step In the Philippines, and
A. P. Van Duzer, whose speech reminded
the audience of where their duty lay on
election day.
Sam Booth's famous Rough Rider's
quartet sang often, but not enough for the
audience. W. I. Heffernan chanted a
comic song: T. Ryan vocalized, as did
Joe, Martin and Fred Everett. Professor
Smith and Professor Jewell furnished a
sleight-of-hand performance.
THE Central Republican Club of
the Thirty-ninth Assembly Dis
trict extended a reception at Sara
toga Hall last night to Julius

scribed as "our present and next Con

hall was packed to the doora with spec

Death of ex-Corporal Heaney.
Ex-Corporal of Police John Heaney,
who for years was station keeper at the
Seventeenth-street station, died yesterday
at Ms home, 33 Noe street. Heaney was
retired on April 4. 1S&9, on account of fail
ing health. He was appointed a member
of the police force on May 22, 1S7S.
Supervisor McCarthy made a discovery
yesterday that the $100 salary demand of
Police Commissioner McNutt for the
ir.onth of June was paid on June 6 without
being registered, whereas his own de
mand, -which was regularly registered in
the City Treasurer's office on June 2, still
remains unpaid. Now, McCarthy dots
not beer any malice toward the Commis
sioner, but he is of the opinion that regis
tered demands take preference over those
which were not registered. He will pre
sent a resolution at the board's: next meet-
Ing requesting the Auditor to compile a
list of al! demands which were paid out
for the month of June after it became
necessary to register them. In this way
he wiil ascertain how many unregistered
demands \rere illegally paid.
What makes McCarthy still more angry
Is that when he asked Deputy Treasurer
Reis why McNutt's demand had been
paid, though It had not been registered,
in advance cf his. which was, that official
blandlv replied, so the Supervisor says:
"Well, you see. Mr. McCarthy, the heads
cf departments have a. 'pull' and are paid
Â¦when others are r.ot. lou will get your
money when the St. Mary's Park fund of
$125,000 is released."
McCarthy thought this explanation was
candid, to fay the least, but failed to see
hovr it accounted for his registered de
xr.ar.d remaining still unpaid four months
after It was registered by the Treasurer.
He contends that registered demands take
preference over all others, and that suffi
cient funds should have been set aside as
moneys came Into the treasury to pay off
&I1 such. In discussing the subject yes
terday McCarthy S2ld:
"I co not for a moment consider in this
matur the SUM of which I have been de
prived, but I do say that the Treasurer
acted without warrant of law In paying
unregistered demands to the exclusion of
those registered. The particular case of
Mr. McNutt may be duplicated by nu
merous others who had the requisite
'pull.' In this way many small registered
claims of people who can ill afford to wait
are still unpaid. I Co not know what can
be done in the matter, but I propose to
find out who were fortunate enough in
having- the 'pull' to draw their salaries
irregularly in advance of others."
Deputy Treasurer Perkins explains the
payment of McNutt's demand by saving
that the day It was presented some
had been turned Into the treasury from
tax collections. He thinks it must have
been raid inadvertently, because It had
not been registered even by the Auditor.
He pays the latter official Â¦ should have
called attention to the illegal, irregular
payment.
"It is a small matter anyhow," says
Perkins, apologetically, "and the demand
was probably paid because McNutt needed
the money."

The question whether life insurance en
dowment policies payable to the Insured
should be made part of the assets of a
bankrupt was argued before United States
Circuit Judges Gilbert and Ross and
United States District Judge Hawley yes
terday. The matter came up on the ap
peal of Adolph P. Scheld of Sacramento
from an order made by United States Dis
trict Judge de Haven, requiring Scheld to
deliver to C. A. Bliss, referee in bank
ruptcy, a twenty-year endowment policy
of the Mutual Life Insurance Company
of New York for $5000, payable to Scheld
himself. In case of the failure of Scheld
to surrender the policy, he was to pay. to
the trustee of his estate $1S7 17, the cash
surrender value of the policy for the bene
fit of the creditors.
A remarkable feature of the case was
the admission of Edward Lande and Al
bert M. Johnson, counsel for Scheld. that
the decision of Justice Shiras in a similar
case was against them, and their conten
tion that Justice Shiras had erred and
that the Circuit Court of Appeals should
disregard his opinion. That decision was
to the effect that in all the States of the
Union life insurance endowment policies
payable to the debtor, his representative,
his estate, or disposable by his will, should
be made a part of the assets of the debtor
for the benefit cf the creditor.
Mr. Johnson took the stand that life in
surance policies, being exempt from ex
ecution under the laws of California,
could not legally be made part of the as
sets of a bankrupt under the Federal stat
ute, because that statute recognized and
allowed to the several States the exemp
tions named in the laws of those States.
Thirty-four States exempted life Insurance
policies from being considered as assets
and eleven States did not. Therefore, ar
gued Mr. Johnson, the provision of tho
Federal statute was meant to apply only
to those eleven States for the protection
of the debtor so as to allow him to give
his wife and children the benefit of the
policy on the payment by him of the cash
surrender value thereof.
Isaac Joseph, attorney for the opposi
tion, quoted a large number of -decisions
sustaining the Shiras opinion and the case
was submitted.
An Interesting story. Is involved In thfs
bankruptcy case. The debtor. Adolph P.
Scheld. is the only son of Philip Scheld,
a millionaire brewer of Sacramento. While
practicing on the county road with a re
volver in March. 1S95. Adolph accidentally
killed Frederick C. Glueck. the owner of
a small roadside house. The widow of
Glueck. on behalf of her four minor chil
dren, sued Scheld for $20,000 damages for
the loss of her husband, and the jury

paid Wilber $15 on February 22 and gave
him a note for $35 on the promise that he
would secure a position for him. He did
not obtain the position. The warrant was
sworn out in Judge Cabanlss' court.
Grand Jury Board Bill Paid.
The Judiciary Committee of the Board
of Supervisors refused to sign a demand
presented a few days ago for $17 10 for
meals furnished to the Grand Jury. Fore
man Kibbler brought the matter to the
attention of Presiding Judge Bahrs. who
thereupon issued a court order to the
Auditor to pass the claim. Auditor Wells
obeyed the order. The Board of Health Is

looking for notoriety, having demonstrat
ed himself unequal to competition in busi
ness. Besides, so the Interested mer
chants say, the books have already been
the object of the most searching scrutiny
in open court and under conditions most
favorable to those who wanted to see
them. It is evident, therefore, that If any
scandal be lurking In the cash books of
the S. E. Slade Lumber Company or of
the San Francisco Timber Preserving
Company it will not come to the surface
to affright ex-offlclals and entertain tht?
public.
P. F. Dundon Is the manager of the San
Francisco Timber Preserving Company.
He discussed Irving's proposal yesterday
and declared that he would not think of
accepting It seriously. "It is onlv a
bluft," said Mr. Dundon. "Irving Is look
ing for some cheap notoriety, but ho
won't get it from me.- The whole affair
seems to be nothing more serious than a
squabble among attorneys. Lawyer Strat
ton hurt somebody's feelings, and I sup
pose somebody Is trying to retaliate. As
far as I know there was no fraud in con
nection with any contract with the Har
bor Commission.
S. K. Slade of the Slade Lumber Com
pany spoke In the same strain. He de
clared that his books had been examined
in court at the time of the trial, and it
would be absurd to suppose that any
business man would open his books for the
inspection of any person who chose to
look at them. "The whole proposition Is
nonsense," said Mr. Slade, "and nobody
knows It better than Irving. He is look
ing for notoriety."
"If there was anything dishonest in our
cash and check books the attorneys for
Irving had ample opportunity to discover
it then. It is idle now to ask for an in
spection of them again. Besides this I
think that the Harbor Commissioners are
well qualified to take care of themselves."
"Irving proved that ho could not com
pete with others, as he had nothing with
which to compete. His so-called pile pre
servative was about as efficacious as
saliva, and his goods weren't wanted. As
for the books of the San Francisco Timber
Preserving Company, they have been in
court and have been thoroughly exam
ined by attorneys who had In their favor
the presumption of knowing their own
business.
THE fund for tho Galveston suffer
ers will not be increased by $1000
If the cash and check books of the
San Francisco Timber Preserving
Company and of the S. E. Slade
Lumber Company nre to be the sources of
the Increase. In an Interview yesterday W.
B. Cope, attorney fcr Samuel C. Irving and
the Parafflne Paint Company, dared the
other two concerns on the name of Irving
to submit to a committee of inspection
their cash and check books, which show
the record of their transactions with the
Board. of Harbor Commissioners for 1S97.
Mr. Cope charges that these records will
show frauds, corruption and favoritism
and his client was willing to give $10X1
just for a glimpse of the interesting rec
ords.
But the S. E. Slade Company and the
San Francisco Timber Preserving Com
pany will not show their books. No mer
chant of standing would do so, they say.
and that Irving, knowing this,* is simply
The sensational demand of Samuel C. Irving upon the S. E. Slade Lumber Company and upon the
San Francisco Timber Preserving 1 Company to submit their check and cash books showing the record of the
transactions of the firms with the Harbor Commissioners for the year 1897 has been politely but most em
phatically refused by the interested merchants. The Galveston sufferers will not, therefore, be enriched by
S1OOO through any expose of alleged frauds in the Board of Harbor Commissioners.
P. F. Ihindon, manager of the San Francisco Timber Preserving Company, laughs at Irving's pro
posal as the bluff of a disgruntled and discredited competitor who wants to secure some sensational affidavit.
Mr. Dundon says that the very books which. Mr. Irving wants to submit to an inspection committee nave been
thoroughly examined in court and nothing new can be learned from them. S. E. Slade of the Slade Lumber
Company shares this opinion. He says that he really has no time to enter into a discussion which must of ne
cessity be profitless. So the harbor scandals, if there be any, must seek for the light through a medium other
than cash or check books.
MONEY CANNOT BUY A
VISION OF THE BOOKS
T. J. Fitzsimons, a mining engineer, re
ported to Captain Seymour .Tuesday that
he had presented a check at the Bank of
California for J300 which he had cashed in
Los Angeles, and he had been informed
that the signature "H. M. Yerington" on
the paper was a forgery -
Fltzslmons explained to the captain that
he nad been in Los Angeles on business
and was introduced to W. W. Cogswell by
a man named Williams, superintendent of
an oil company, who told him that Cogs
well was In the oil business. Cogswell
learned that Fitzsimons was to return to
this city and asked him if he would oblige
him by cashing the check, which was
drawn on the Bank of California. It pur
ported to be signed by H. M. Yerington,
a well known mining man of Virginia
City. Fitzsimons had the money and
cashed the check. He returned to the
city Monday and- presented the paper for
payment, with the result mentioned.
Captain Seymour wired to Chief Elton
of Los Angeles to arrest Cogswell, and
received a reply that no one of that name
could be found In that city, and to send a
full descripticn of him. Seymour did so
yesterday morning, and a few hours later
received a reply that Cogswell had been
arrested.
The bank officials wired Yerington of
the forgery, and he replied that Cogswell
was known In Virginia City, but he had
not given him any check. The officials
say that the forgery is a very clever one
and closely resembles Yerington's signa
ture.
The case will have to be tried In Los
Angeles, as the crime was committed
there, and Fitzsimons will leave at once
to prosecute the prisoner. The police here
are puzzled to know why Cor^well should
have remained in Los Angeles after Fitz
simons' departure, as he must have real
ized the fact that the forgery would be
discovered as soon as the check was pre
sented at the bank.
T. J. Fitzsimons, a Mining
Engineer, Cashes Worth

A striking example of woman's heroism
was witnessed at the Waldeck Sanita
rium yesterday forenoon. A devoted sis
ter gave up the blood from her own veins
that a sinking brother might tfe strength
ened and saved If possible from the grave.
There was a pathetic as well as a heroic
side to the scene.
At the bedside of Attorney M. A. EKsrn.
whose serious Illness was noted in Tues
day's Call, Dr. Dora Dorn stood, and
while she stroked her brother's brow and
whispered words of encouragement Into
his ears skilled physicians transfused
from her arm her rich, strength-giving
blood into the arm of the sinking patient.
More than a pint of the fluid was trans
ferred to the fast failing man, and as the
experiment was concluded the anxious at
tendants could see that the patient was
rallying, and again there seemed to be a
rav of nope. , .
So far did Mr. Dorn regain his former
self during the transfusion process that
he was able to speak to those around
him: then he relapsed into a peaceful
slumber, from which he did not fully
awaken until nearly 6 o'clock last even-
Ing. Almost Immediately upon his awak
ening there came a serious relapse and at
midnight the end seemed but a few hours
Mr Dorn was first taken 111 six months
ago, his malady at that time being diag
nosed as poisoning of the blood cells.
This developed Into an affection which
destroys the red corpuscles of the blood
until the supply Is one-fifth less* than na
ture Intended it should have.
Two weeks ago yesterday Lawyer Dorn
visited his office for the last time before
being taken to his bed. Since that day the
patient has sunk rapidly. Everything that
medical science afforded was brought Into
use. but the benefits. If any. were only
temporary- As a final resort and upon-the
earnest entreaties of the patient's sister,
who is a recent graduate of the Lnlverslty
of California Medical College, it was de
termined to experiment with the trans
fusion process.
Dr. Sherman, assisted by Drs. w. W .
Kerr, Herbert C. Moffltt and John Gall

being taken from, one of the smaller veins
of the young woman's arm and driven

Mr. Irish is indeed stumping the same territory
where four years ago his voice was raised for McKin
ley, but it happens that his voice continues to be raised
for. McKinley. He went East on the urgent invita
tion of the Republican National Committee to aid
again as four years ago in supporting the cause of
sound money, law and good government. There has
been no "flip-flop" on the part of John P. Irish. He
is not that kind of a man. The Wasp should find the
joker who gave it that bit of stuffing and remonstrate
with him through the medium of a club.
The Wasp should not leave itself liable to
be played upon in that way concerning a man who is
so well known as Mr. Irish. Such blunders are al
most as bad as the fakes of yellow journalism.. The
Wasp should post itself.
SOME ONE has caught the Wasp napping and
stuffed it. Doubtless the joker enjoyed himself
immensely when he saw the stuffing result in
an announcement by the Wasp that "John P. Irish
is stumping the same territory for Bryan where four
years ago his voice was raised for McKinley." It
then proceeds to class Mr. Irish with Bourke Cock
ran, puts them down as "acrobatic orators," describes
them as men "who throw flip-flops with celerity," and
then gravely informs its serious readers: "The real
reason why McKinley Democrats, like Irish and
Cochrane, flopped to Bryan this year is that they
want to get their political life preservers, so to speak,
and float in on the tide four years hence."

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
Summing up, the report says: "That if your hon
orable board during the next fiscal year is able to ac
complish the repavement of the worst business streets,
the repair of Spear-street wharf, the repair of county
roads and a systematic system of street repairs, we
Furthermore, in the way of needed improvements
the report recommends the rebuilding of the Spear
street wharf, the thorough repair of Mission road and
the* adoption of a systematic plan for repairing and
keeping in repair the basalt block streets throughout
the city. To that emi it is recommended that the city
be divided into small districts and a number of men
be. employed in each district to keep the streets in
good o'rder.
For the purpose of carrying out the programme the
recommendations propose that the city be divided into
districts; that the appropriations of each year be dis
tributed among them in proportion to their needs;
that a schedule of streets to be repaved each year be
decided upon in order that those who may be disap
pointed because the streets in which they are mainly
interested are not repaved the first year may haveas
snrance they will be attended to at some fixed time
during the four years; that in most cases. the repaving
be done with asphalt or witTi small basalt blocks on
concrete, while on some streets vitrified brick would
be desirable if the material can be obtained of a satis
factory quality at a fair price; that all pavements be laul
under a ten year guarantee; that the city retain for
its own use the cobbles and basalt blocks removed
from the repaved streets instead of selling them 10
the contractor for a nominal sum; and, finally, that if
any parties desire to have certain streets repaved
sooner than contemplated by the schedule adopted
they should offer to contribute one-half the cost of
the work as an evidence that the necessity for the im
mediate repavement of those streets is very great.
In the report submitted by the association to the
Board of Public Works it is recommended that a
systematic plan of repaving be adopted, which will
result in the removal of the cobbles and the repaving
oi the worst streets in the business district within four
years, and that $125,000 be appropriated and expended
each year for the next four fiscal years in the per-
CITY ATTORNEY LANE holds that the Su
pervisors have no authority to make use of any
part of the surplus revenue resulting from the
increase of the assessment over the estimate made at
the time the revenues of the city were calculated and
the various appropriations decided upon. That will
leave in the city treasury a considerable sum to be
used in making appropriations for the next fiscal
year, and it is important to decide how it can be ex
pended to the best advantage. Such being the case
the recommendation of the Merchants' Association
concerning the improvement of the streets comes as a
timely and pertinent suggestion. Street improvements
are for the benefit of all, and hardly any policy would
be so pleasing to a majority of the people as the adop
tion of a comprehensive and well devised programme
of improvements of that kind.

PERSONAL MENTION.
From certain statements made bv Chretien and by
llansted it appears we are to have further complica
tions in this case of the Sullivan estate. The public
will be glad to have every secret t)f the conspiracy
disclosed. It is not a pleasant thing to know that
men who are licensed to practice as members of an
honorable profession have been guilty of criminal of
fenses, but it is better to have the evil known than to
let it go on in secret. Were the members of the Bar
Association wife they would recognize the force of
public sentiment in ihe matter and lend their aid to
the task of bringing ;-bout the conviction of all who
have been criminally guilty and the disbarment of all
who have shared in the moral guilt by aiding the
conspiracy or consenting to it and deriving a profit
from it.
Now that the Grand Jury has recommended the dis
barment of Rogers it would seem the Bar Association
can no longer remain inactive. Must an attorney be
actually convicted of crime and be sert to prison be
fore the Bar Association deems him unworthy to be
a member of the bar? IÂ« the standard of the profes
sion to be fixed no higher than that of convicted
criminals?
The facts oi the offense of Rogers have been before
the public a long time and are notorious. His guilt
has never been judicially determined, and under our
code of laws he is entitled, should he be brought to
trial, to be presumed innocent until evidence has been
submitted to overthrow the presumption; but enough
evidence has been furnished to afford a moral con
viction that he was a party to one of the worst of
fenses an attorney can commit. It is known that he
testified in court he had neither received nor been
proinised money to withdraw his objection to the
distribution of the estate of Sullivan to the bogus
heir; it is known that several witnesses have contra
dicted that testimony by asserting that he was paid
lor doing that very thing; it is known that he refused
to answer questions put to him relating to the case,
and gave as a reason for refusing that his answers
would incriminate him. All that and other details
addincr confirmation to a moral conviction of his guilt
have been known to the Bar Association as well as
to the Grand Jury, and yet the association has neg
lected to take any step to purge the bar of Rogers'
presence and to clear the profession of the stain he has
put upon it.
THE GRflND JURY fiND THE BAR.
\\ EMBERS of the Bar Association who have
/ \ respect for their profession can hardly be
â¢ * pleased with the situation that conironts them.
The association has delayed so long in making an in
vestigation of the professional conduct of Attorney
Rogers in connection with the conspiracy to loot the
estate of the late Joseph Sullivan that the Grand
Jury has felt impelled by duty to take upon itself the
responsibility of recommending his disbarment. Are
the professional ethics of the Bar Association so low
that grand juries have to point out to its members
the path of honor?
I 7E are to have Sir Thomas Lipton with us
\\] again. He has issued through the Belfast
Yacht Club another challenge for the
America's cup. and oi course the challenge will be
accepted. Sir Thomas won golden opinions from ?.ll
sorts of Americans when he was here on his former
venture, and it goes without saying his return will be
gladly welcomed.
Lipton is one of the men who do not like to rest
beaten. He started with nothing and by energetic
perseverance has made himself one of the richest men
it: the British empire. He is perhaps the largest mer
chant now living. His business is enormous, but
none the less he finds time for a host of other things
besides money-making. It is only of recent years that
he has taken to sport, but he has entered upon it with
extraordinary vim and vigor. His particular ambi
tion now is to beat Americans at yachting. He is
reported to have said in a recent interview: "I would
give every penny I lnve and begin again at the bot
tom of the ladder to lift the America's cup."
Lipton is not the kind of a sportsman that "goes it
blind." He has studied over the defeat of his former
yacht and has come to the conclusion he can build a
better one and sail it better. He recently stated in
London to a representative of the Associated Press:
"I have every reason to believe I stand a good chance
of winning, for I would not challenge unless sure I
could get a better boat than my last. Moreover, I
know I have gbt to get the very best going in order
to achieve a triumph over the wonderful energy and
skill of the Americans, for wftich no one has greater
admiration than I. Realizing this, I have been work
ing steadily for months to perfect my arrangements.
I now believe that both the boat and the men next
contesting for the America's cup will be an improve
ment over. my first attempt."
When asked concerning the man to whom he in
tends trusting the sailing of the yacht he said: "I
have secured a man who is universally admitted to bo
the best skipper on this side â an amateur who stands
easily ahead of his fellows. I can't tell his name just
yet, and, naturally, I cannot say much about the boat.
But races that* will rival the actual cup races in keen
ness of interest will be the trial contests between the
boat which Watson is designing for me and the old
Shamrock with the alterations Fife is contemplating
for the latter. Both designers, the best in England,
will be on board their respective boats, and I can
guarantee the one that wins will give you, akany rate,
a close race.".
It will be seen from these statements we are to have
a challenger that will be worthy of the best we can
do. The old Shamrock is to be improved to the best
of the skill of her builder. She is then to be tested
by a trial against the new Shamrock. The winner is
to make the race against the American boat. Such a
challenge will put our builders upon their mettle and
we shall doubtless see another marvelous .production
in the way of yacht construction. At any rate in
terest in the race will be keener than ever, and should
Lipton carry oft the cup it is safe to say he will not
hold it long before called upon to meet an American
challenger.
In connection with this subject it is worth while to
call attention to the fact that Lipton's first contest
for the America's cup was reported by The Call and
the New York Herald by wireless telegraphy over a
distance of about twelve miles, and the feat was ac
counted so wonderful that yellow and unprogressive
journals thought it safe to mock at it as a fake. Wire
less telegraphy has now so far advanced that message.3
can be sent a distance of sixty miles or more. When
Shamrock II comes to try her speed for the great cup
it will be possible to far surpass the records of wire
less telegraph reports of the first race, and The Call
can be counted on to do it.
UPTON'S NEW CHALLENGE.
My chief objection to the establishment
of an Intermediate court of appeals is
that it would multiply, the Judicial offices
and add greatly to the expense without
ultimately expediting the work. Also be
cause litigants whose causes under this
amendment will find an end In the Inter
mediate court of appeals will think they
are discriminated against because they
are denied the privilege of an ultimate
appeal to the highest court. I am further
opposed to It because this Intermediate
court will be composed of Judge3 selected
from the locality in which the causes
were originally tried. I believe It to be
desirable that the court of ultimate- ap
peal should be removed as far as possible
from all local influence.

5. The proposed amendment will give
rise to an intolerable crop of petty ap
peals in probate estates and thereby in
crease the expense of administering
them. Under the present constitution the
Supreme? Court has juiisdictlon "in such
probate matters as may be provided by
law. In other words there can be no
appeal in any probate case except where
the Legislature has provided an appeal.
Following that provision of the constitu
tion the Legislature has provided an ap
peal in every probate matter where there
is 8ny reasonable necessity for an ap
peal. But under the proposed constitu
tional ampndment the District Court of
Appeals will have jurisdiction of every
special proceeding- commenced In the Su
perior Courts. The administration of an
estate is a special proceeding. And the
District Courts of Appeal will h<lve juris
diction of an appeal from every order
made in such a proceeding. It is needless
to point ant that that will give rise to a
great crop of appeals which are cut off
by the present system, and that taking
such appeals and the opportunities which
are afforded for such appeals will in
crease the cost and enhance the vexation
and delay of probate administration. That
these things have reached the limit of ail
reasonable endurance it is unnecessary
for any one to point out.
4. The provision authorizing the Gover
nor to appoint three courts of appeal for
two years should defeat the amendment.
If the amendment is adopted it will go
Into effect in January, 1901. There will be
no election for judges until November.
1902. The Governor in the meantime is
authorized to appoint the three district
courts of appeal, and all cases over which
they have jurisdiction on file in the Su
preme Court, but not under submission,
are to be immediately transferred to those
district courts. So that for two years the
appointees of one man are to control all
of the litigation of this State in the courts
of last resort. No man was ever made so
wise and upright as to Justify such enor
mous power. *
3. The provision authorizing the Supreme
Court to take Jurisdiction of cases decided
in the District Court Is unsatisfactory.
The Supreme Court is authorized by the
proposed amendment to order a case de
cided by the District Court to be sent to

provision is borrowed from the Federal
law, which, authorizes the United States

than by a district made up of Sacramento
and the contiguous territory.
THE constitutional amendment pro
viding for the creation of an inter
mediate court of appeals In this
State, which will be voted on at the
coming: election, is not meeting the
indorsement expected. Lawyers who have
looked deeply into the amendment and
calculated its effect if enforced do not be
lieve it will improve on the present sys
tem, and the general presumption is that
it will be an unsatisfactory and ineffectual
scheme throughout. There are various
arguments urged against It. but in â¢ the
principal objections there is little diversity
of opinion, in opposition to the amend
ment this can be said:
1. For the overwhelming majority of
the people of this State, the Supreme
Court of California, chosen by the people
of the entire State, is practically abol
ished. /â¢Â¦â¢Â¦
It is true that the proposed constitu
tional amendment continues In existence
a Supreme Court elected by the entire
State, and consisting of a Chief Justice
and four Associate Justices. But, on the
other hand, the jurisdiction of the court
is so limited and curtailed that a very
small percentage of the litigation of the
State will ever.be decided by that tribu
nal. So that the vast volume of litiga
tion will be finally determined in the Dis
trict Courts of Appeal, and for all practi
cal purposes in those cases the Supreme
Court -Rill have been abolished.
By section 2 of the proposed amendment
tho Supreme Court is given appellate Ju
risdiction as follows:
In every action and proceeding where
is necessarily drawn in question: (a) The
validity of any law of or authority claim
ed from the Federal Government; (b) the
constitutionality of any law of this State;
(c) the legality of any tax, impost or as
sessment: (d) actions in eminent domain:
(e) actions in quo warranto; (f) criminal
actions involving death or imprisonment
for life; (g) the validity or adoption of
any municipal charter; (h) writs of man
damus, certiorarl and prohibition to the
District 'Courts of Appeal; (I) writs of
mandamus, certiorari or prohibition af
fecting the State, Congressional or Presi
dential election; (j) and in cases decided
in District Courts of Appeal when in the
opinion of the Supreme Court such deci
sion "conflicts with a previous decision ot
the Supreme Court or of another District
Court of Appeals."
The cases coming under the grant of
jurisdiction above outlined (excepting ap
peals which the Supreme Court may
grant at its pleasure to those who are ag
grieved by the final decision of the Dis
trict Court). will hardly exceed one-tenth
(certainly not one-iifth) of the cases now
heard and determined by the Supreme
Court. So that it would seem to have
been hardly worth while to have kept the
Supreme Court at all. Eighty or ninety
per cent of its jurisdiction has been taken
away and given to District Courts of Ap
peal. And unless Courts of Appeal elect
ed by districts are preferable to a court
elected by the entire State the amend
ment should be defeated on this ground
alone.
2. A system of district courts of appeal
is not as satisfactory as a court of last
resort elected by the entire people of tha
State. In every State in the Union vast
jurisdiction is given to Its court of last
resort, and that court is always elected
by the entire people of the State. It can
hardly be denied that the system which
we are now trying to change Is preferable
to the one which we are endeavoring to
inaugurate. A Supreme Court elected by
the entire people of the State is removed
from the local prejudice of the district
system. If a citizen of San Francisco Is
sued in Los Angeles and loses his case
owing to prejudice against him for non
residence he will be very apt to think that
that. same prejudice will exist to some
extent in District Courts of Appeal and he
would prefer, and every lover of justice
would also prefer, to have his case heard
in a tribunal free from such bias. On the
other hand, if a citizen of Los Angeles
la sued In Sacramento he would very
much prefer to have his case appealed to
a court elected by an entire State rather

UTTERANCE
These things, at any rate, can be said to the work
nigmen without danger of refutation: You asked
four years ago for work, and it has been given to you
more abundantly than ever before in history; you
asked for good wages, and you have received them
in money equal to the best in the world; you asked
for an opportunity to pay off mortgages and to in
crease savings banks' deposits, and the mortgages
have been paid off and the deposits increased; you
asked for prosperity and it has been given to you;
the products of your industries have been conserved
to you by wise legislation, and that legislation is but
the enactment into law of policies which William Mc-
Kinley advocated ever since he arrived, at man's es
tate. Judge, then, which is the better friend of labor,
Bryan, who has done nothing, or McKinley, who has
done so much for the benefit of every American in
dustry and every American worker.
President McKinley's interest in workingmen,
moreover, has not been manifest solely in large meas
ures designed to benefit them a? a mass. He has
shown his respect for their abilities by appointing
many of them to positions of important public trust.
Xo other President has conferred political office upon
so many men who earn their living by what is com
monly called labor. Judged by any standard. trie/
by any test, considered from any point of view, no
other statesman in American politics has been so con
sistently and so efficiently a friend of the workingman
as the President whose re-election Mr. Bryan is now
contesting and whom he is denouncing as an impe
rialist.
When Bryan was in Congress he was a free trader.
He did his uttermost to break down the wall of pro
tection which keeps the American factory safe from
the competition of foreign factories, the American
worker free from the necessity of meeting the cheap
labor of other countries upon the level of a low scale
of wages, and the American home from the compara
tive destitution that prevails in the homes of the ill
paid labor of Europe. He was among the men who
arc most responsible for the free trade depression thai
followed the Wilson bill. His only promise to labor
was the vain one of offering them cheap money by
the free coinage of silver, a scheme which, if carried
out in connection with free trade, would not only have
compelled our workingmen to meet European labor
in unrestricted competition, but would have paid
them in money of less value than is given the work
ingmen of Britain or Germany or France or even of
Japan.
Turning from Bryan's pretenses to the achieve
ments of the President, Senator Hanna said: "There
is not a man here who does not know that William
McKinley has been the best friend of the working
men this country has ever produced." If we are to
judge men by what they accomplish that statement is
.not to be disputed. Other statesmen may have been
as devoted to the welfare of their fellow citizens as
MoKinley, and unquestionably many of them weÂ«v,
but none ever did so much in office to provide work
for American labor or to maintain a high rate of
wages for all workers. His whole public life has been
devoted to the end of upbuilding American indus
tries. His fame will be forever associated with the
statesmanship that means work and wages. He has
been patriotic in every way in times of war and in
times of peace, but his efforts have been most con
spicuous in advancing the cause of labor and provid
ing prosperity for American homes.
|~N ESPITE Mr. Bryan's loud and frequent decla-
I ) rations of his love for the workingmen of the
United States he has not been able to show
his followers a single act ever achieved by him for the
benefit of labor. At a recent meeting at Milwaukee
largely attended by workingmen some of the Bryan
ites present frequently interrupted the speaker, Sena
tor Hanna. and at last the Senator put to them this
question: "What has William J. Bryan ever done for
the working people of this country?" There was si
lence for a moment, and then a voice spoke out:
"Nothing." There was not a Bryanite present who
could dispute that declaration.
ThJE FRIEND OF THE WORKlNGMflN.
With that statement there will be general agreement.
We have been promised so much and have received
so little in the way of performance, anything accom
plished in the way of good work will be highly grati
fying. That there is urgent need for street improve
ment in San Francisco none will deny, and, while
there may be some objection to the details of the
schedule of streets to be improved submitted along
with the report, the programme as a whole will find
cordial support. In urging this matter the Merchants'
Association has performed another of those valuable
services to the city which entitle it to the co-operation
of all who have sufficient public spirit and energy to
work for a progressive San Francisco. .-
believe a great advance will have been made and the
citizens generally will be well satisfied."

ATI suppose that Shakespeare would be
called a "little Englander" by the read
ers of Mr. Kipling's poems, so far re
moved does the England of Elizabeth
eeem from the empire of Victoria. And
yet the same glad note of triumph niifl
patriotism rings through the historical
plays of the great dramatist that we have
learned to listen for in the poems of the
laureate of Greater P^ngland. Among a
good many other things Shakespeare wa3
a patriot,, and Swinburne has aptly spok
en of the national side of hia genius, "the
heroic vein of patriotism that runs like a
thread of living tire through the world
wide range of his omnipresent spirit."
He was a man of his age as well as of all
time; he shared in the awakened national
spirit of his people, and through the
drama found adequate means to give ex
pression to it.
Shakespeare came to London about two
years before the battle of the Spanish
armada. Emerging from the anarchy
that had followed In the wake of the
wars of the roses. England under the Tu
dors became a nation strong in govern
ment and in war. Elizabeth especially by
her strong magnetic personality and good
sense had rallied the national spirit. We
can but faintly imagine what the victory
over Spain meant to tho English people;
for the next ten years they were in the
very heyday of a vigorous and Joyous life.
Shakespeare's star rose with the star of
his country, and for ten years (1390 (?)-9)
his genius found full sway in historical
plays. The national spirit found expres
sion In chronicles and histories. In poems
addressed to the Queen, In Spenser's
"Faerie Queen," in Bacon's "Advance
ment of Learning," but above all in the
drama, and beyond all other dramatists
In Shakespeare. The England of Raleigh
and Sidney, of Drake and Spenser, of
Bacon and .Hooker, of Elizabeth and
Shakespeare, was of all ages the one best
suited for the development of a great
drama, for, as John Addlngton Symonda
pointed out, the drama more than any
other form of art needs just such an en
vironment in which to flourish, and espe
cially the historical drama.
The theaters of that time were rude
enough when compared with the splendid
structures of modern time. On swampy
ground beside the Thames they lay; the
largest were wooden sheds, only half
thatched with rushes, with a trench
around them and a flagstaff on the roof.
What the audience had to do in the way
of Imagination may well be seen in the
prologue to "Henry V." And yet. rude
as these theaters were, on the stage the
old. kings and heroes came back to life
and England's battles were fought over
again before an interested audience. The
striking thing about this audience was its
representative character. The Queen was
never there, but she had regular com
panies to act before her, and many of the
plays received their first applause from
her. All other people went to the thea
ter; rich and magnetic noblemen like
Pembroke and Southampton were the pa
trons of the theater;' the well-to-do mid
dle classes were there and the pit. too
ready to applaud every low Jest. In a
word, the nation was there, and the com
posite character of the audience contrib
uted to the nationalization of the drama.

The same criticism has been passed on

they are not true to history. Many inter

has been said one gets a very vivid idea
of some of the leading Kings and events

were vitalized. One may still have an
idea of the impression produced by Scott's
novels in the early years of this century
when the heroes of the middle ages came
back to life and ministered to the new
romantic spirit. And so one may Imagine
the effect produced on an Elizabethan au
dience by -scenes and passages In the
plays of Shakespeare. What Homer's
poems were to the Greeks these play3
were to the Elizabethans and will be to
all Englishmen.
I shall not attempt to give anything like
a running account of all the historical
p!ays, only to call attention to pome of
the passages and scenes that would have
appealed most to an Elizabethan audi
ence. The very fact that most of the plays
had to do with the days of chivalry would
arouse the martial spirit of the people of
that day, but there were special Incidents
that must have ,been applauded to the
echo, and from what we Know of Shakes
peare we must feel that in these passages
he was speaking to the galleries. Some of
the passages that will be referred to must
have aroused the audience to a white heat
of patriotism, especially when spoken by.
a great actor like Burbage.
Such a scene Is the conclusion of "King
John." We have represented In the play
the old feud between England and
France. There Is not much to attract one
to" the weak King, and for a lonar time
one's sympathies are rather aealnst him.
Falconbridge. however, stands for the
Indomitable English spiritâ he Is the na
tional hero. "When the French anny In

the Pope, and John has about submitted
to the terms of surrender. Falconbridge
becomes the leader of the, people and ral

For the Mexican Trade.
The British steamer Manauense Is to be
put under the Mexican flag and Captain
John Von Helms will bo her master. The
Manauense is to run in opposition to tho
Curacao and the vessels of the Pacifle
Coast Steamship Company's fleet. She Is
a fast and commodious steamer, fitted
with a refrigerating plant and everything
necessary for a run in the tropics. Cap
tain Von Helms is a great favorite in
Mexican ports, so the Manauenso should
do well on the coast.

Jeanie's Chief Mate Suspended.
Captains Bolles and Bulger, United
States Inspectors of Steam Vessels, filed
yesterday -with Supervising Inspector
Captain John Bermlngham their report on
the grounding of, the steamer Jeanie on
Point Arena recently. They find that Cap
tain A. H. Mason, the master of the ves
eel, was not negligent, he having 1 given
orders to his chief mate. James Marshall,
to notify him when he should see the
Point Arena light, and that if he did not
see it before a certain hour to call him up.
Marshall neglected to call the captain and
the steamer went on the rocks. The In
spectors found also that for half an hour
the Eteamer had been running in a fog
from one-half to three-quarters of a mile
from the shore. The steamer was dam
aged about $4000. Mate MarshalTs llcenso
was suspended for six months.

Chicago Livestock Market.
I/>NI>ON. Oct. 17.â At the wool auction oaleÂ«
to-day there was a good attendance and busi
ness was active. The .number of bales offered
was 11.7S8. CroBS-breds were In smaller supply
and were well competed for by the home trade
and the Continent, American representatives
puylng full prices. Cape of Good Hope and
Natals were in good supply and In steady de
infind. most of the stock offered being sold
Some of the snow white were withdrawn on
account of their meeting with sellers' views
New clip New Zealand wools sold well and
coarse grades were firm.
London Wool Market.
BOSTON, Oct. 17.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow: The wool
market has been more active, the sales of the
week aggrejratlng 3.814.S00 pounds. Meat of th6
purchasing has been done by the mills of mod
erate size. Some of the large consumers have
been around and have made some offers, but
these were In most Instances below the Ideas
of holders and the result is that they secured
but little wool. The Influence of the political
campaign is still being felt In the wool mar
ket and the large consumers as a whole have
evidently made up their minds to wait until
after the election before laying In large lines.
Here and there may be noted an Indication of
a speculative tendency In anticipation of orders
for goods after the election, but this cuts but
little figure In the market as yet. In the West
holders still remain firm and attempts which
have been made by representatives of the East
ern trade to break prices have failed. The
sales of the week In Boston amounted "to 3,204,
300 pounds domestic and 110,000 pounds foreign,
making a total of 3,314,300 pounds, against a
total of 2,881,000 pounds for the previous week
and a total of 8,020,000 pounds for the corre
sponding week last year. The Bales since Jan
uary 1 amount to 104,501.800 pounds, against
238,974,100 pounds for the corresponding time
last year. â¢ .

NEW YOPJi STOCK LIST.
NEW YORK, Oct. 17.â Some continued ef
loit was made in rrofessional quarters to ad
vance the j>rice of stocks to-<Jay, but the bull
* forces were considerably depleted and it was
evident :;.-* the manipulation for the advance
In some quarters was taken advantage of to
realize 1:1 others. Yesterday's market fairly
demonstrated that the outstanding ehort In
terest had bees reduced to such proportions an
to make their demand Ineffective in continu
ing the advance In prices. To-day lt looked
very much as though some of the Important
bull interests had taken early cognizance of
this fact, and had promptly taken their profits.
iÂ£ome of Uie recent lr.nuential bull operators
had fairly reversed their position to-day and
wt-re openly large sellers of stocks. There was
FUiflclect fhow of ttrength in yesterday's mar
ket to attract a considerable accumulation of
buying orders Irom outside sources this morn
[OC la eiiite of opening rtct-sHions this buy
'lng encouraged the bulls to resume operations
fur the advance. The sharp twUt to the Ehort
Interest in People's Gas was an Influential
lactor in their favor. The definitive announce
ment that the People's and the Ogden com
panies had adjuster! their difficulties and had
come und'.r one control caused excited trad
lr^j in People'* Gas. Orders were simultane
ously executed at quotations running from 93*i
down to i2 on the sale ol Â£300 shares at the
oiKÂ»r.lr^. The crlce was later run up an ex
treme 2\. It was owing to the amount of
long fitfjek which came out at that level the
jirlce Xell back tnd the ttock closed with a
net caln cf cr.ly 1^. Tl.e reaction in People's
tias and the taUslaciion of the outside de
mand lor stacks made the latter manipulation
ir.r the advance intr!Tt-ctual. Southern liallway
X'rcferrcd and Lrjuitsville and Nashville were
j.URted up 1% and \% and there was eager
buying cf the Iteadlng etrxks on the conr
l>ujiy'f settlement with the miners. Lake Krle
j>nd Western had a striking advance of three
;â¢:â¢.'- and Conculidated Uas rosÂ« 4Â»i. Tliere
were some Eubttar.tlal gains In a number of
less prominent, stocks, ar^d among them a few
net sair.s were saved en the day. But the
dGslr.g showed a reactionary tendency through
out'and was lmi|. with many Ftocks at the
lOjII'iat of the day and :.'t lueees the rule. The
txpectation is pretty confident that next Sat
urday's bank ttatCSMSt will make a strong
fhuwing. but there is seme recurrent anxiety
&Â£ u> f- - future.
TTie currtnt relief from the sub-treasury Is
believed to have about come to an end and
bhould a recovery in the price or cotton Induce
a renewed demand for funds from the Interior,
the Kcw York money market would again have
to face the problem of falling reserves.
There was a falling off in the activity of
the bond market and lncrease<l Irregularity.

j CHICAGO. Oct. 17.â Wheat was firm the
j first half of the session under the influence of
i an advance at Liverpool and reports of dam

active, wltji a little nibbling for the English
; account. December opened 14-5 %c higher at

I touched 75'ic The ofterlngs were- easily taken
, and later encouragements in the way of reports
j of a cash demand in the Northwest and a
j sharp advance at Duluth, together with the
1 lightness of Northwest receipts, I>ecember
; steadily advanced to 76%@75\c The bulge,
j however, failed to receive support and under
; spelling by disgusted local Bulls, December
; dropped to 74Tj.c, and closed heavy, VÂ»c under

I Oats were stagnent and deserted. December

CLOSING.
NEW YORK, Oct. 17.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram Â«ays:
The markets here were Irregular and Inactive
to-day, except In the American department, be
ing discouraged by the way In which the set
tlemer.t of the African and Chinese troubles Is
dragging. Americans opened weak here fear
ing the effects of Bryan's work In New York.
N*w York rallied prices later.
Paris was unsettled, selling Spanish bonds
and Brazilians rather heavily.
The bank sold Â£42.000 gold In French coin.
It Is understood that French wool merchants
8re drawing against recent heavy speculative
purchases of wool In Australia. There was a
strong demand to-day for gold, which Is held
at 77s 114d. but the supply Is small. It Is
the general opinion here that the bank mini
mum discount rate will not be advanced to
mcrrtyw.

E. Black Ryan, tax attorney for the
Southern Pacific, has practically com
pleted his annual report of taxes to be
paid by the company on this year's State,
county and municipal levies. Between
now and the last Monday in November
$730,000 in taxes must be paid out by the
company. Of this amount $30,000 goes to
Alameda County, not including $20,240.
which is to be paid the city of Oakland
next week as Its share of the corpora
tion's big earnings.
The amount Is a trifle more than -was
paid into the Oakland treasury a year
ago. The three-quarters of a million
which the company must pay before De
cember 1 represents less than half what
it must pay before April. 1901. The
amount that will then be due will bring
the sum total of the Southern Pacific's
tax account up to about Jl.800,000.

Is still alive to tell the story. Ho

he observed the anniversary* of the event

Engineer Stark was enabled to assist at
history-making, was owned and controlled
by the late A. A. Cohen, who acted aa

there being a large number of distin
guished guests present. The way through
which the railroad ran was lined with
trees and several times the engineer
stopped the train and rescued his hat
from the grasp of a sharp-pointed branch.
The engine used on this tilal trip was
something of a phenomenon. ' It was a
little steam engine fitted Into the end of
a boxcar. It weighed about five tons and
with a cylinder 9x18. All the rolling stock
was used on the run. It consisted of two
passenger and two flat cars. These caw
were small and primitive, with a pair of
wheels under each end, like a wagon.
High street was the terminus of the
Cohen railroad until the following Feb
ruary, when, the rails being laid as far
as San Leandro, trains ran to that town.
In 1S65 the road was completed through
to Haywards. In 1S69 It was sold to tho
Central Pacific Railroad, becoming a part

"My old attacks of sick stomach were
a little slower to yield, but bv continuing
the food that trouble has disappeared

All druggists sell Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets at 50 cents foV full-sized package, and
they are probably the safest and moet re-
liable cure for any form of catarrh.
He claims they are far superior to In-
halers, salves, lotions or powder, and ara
much more convenient and pleasant to
take and are so harmless that little chil-
dren take them with benefit, as they con-
tain no opiate, cocaine or any poisonous
drug. /
Mr. OÂ«o. J. Casanova of Hotel Griffon.
West Ninth street. New York City,
writes: I have commenced usinr Stuart's
Catarrh Tablets and already they have
given me better results than any catarrh
cure I have ever tried.
A leading physician of Plttsburg advises
the use of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets In
preference to any other treatment for
catarrh of tho head, throat or stomach.
For several years tucalyptol. Guatacoi
and Hydrastin have been recognized as
standard remedies for catarrhal troubles,
but they have always been given separate-
ly and only very recently an Ingenious
cnemlst succeeded in combining them, to-
gether with other antiseptics. Into a pleas-
ant, effective tablet.
Druggists sell the remedy under tho
name of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets anil It
has met with remarkable success in the
cure of nasal catarrh, bronchial and
throat catarrh and in catarrh of the
stomach.
Mr. F. N. Benton, whose address Is care
of Clark House. Troy. N\ Y.. says: Wh&n
I run up against anything that Is good I
like to tell people of It. I have beÂ«Â»n
troubled â¢ with catarrh more or less for
some time. Last winter more than ever.
Tried several so-called cures, but did not
get any benefit from them. About six
weeks ago I bought a 50-cent box of
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets and 1 am glad
to say that they have done wonders for
me and I do not hesitate to let all my
friends know that Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets are the right thing.

Geffeaey's Passes Having Failed,
They Will Now Try to Succeed
by Another Scheme.
E. B. Salomon filed in the United States
Immigration Bureau yesterday an appeal
from the decision of Commissioner North
ordering the deportation of Sui Xishida,
Sono Mahuda and Komo Miyakawa, Jap
anese women who are believed to have
been imported for immoral purposes.
These are the women whom Japanese
Interpreter Charles Geffeney and Attorney
Robert Lyons attempted to land from the
America Maru last Monday with three
passes of the Immigration Bureau signed
Ly Immigration Inspector A. H. Geffeney.
a' brother of Charles. The conspiracy was
frustrated by the vigilance of Customs
Inspectors Frank Barry and W. J. Hen
dricks. who refused to allow the women
to land, the inspectors having been pre
viously instructed by Customs Surveyor
Spear to hold them until released by an
immigration inspector in person.
Inspector A. H. Geffeney has failed to
explain how the passes fell into the hands
of his brother and Attorney Lyons. He
5aid on Monday that he did not know how
it happened, that he usually 6igned the
passes in blank and that he may have lost
or mislaid the threÂ« in question. He left
the office yesterdav morning at five min
utes after 9 o'clock, saying that he was
coing to his home in Fruitvale to attend
his wife, who was very sick. Commis
sioner Hart II- North is sick in bed in
Oakland, and his deputy. Captain Schell,
was summoned thither yesterday for a
conference.
Charles Geffeney has made a statement
that the passes were shown him by Lyons,
â¢who informed him that he had received
them from a Japanese named Nakada, a
hanger-on around the office of the Immi
gration Bureau. Mr. Geffeney made other
statements very damaging to his brother,
the Inspector, if true, but Charles was
very much under the influence of liquor
or an opiate at the time. A. H. Geffeney
says that his brother is hardly responsi
ble for what he says and that his mental
condition is not normal.
APPEAL IS TAKEN
BY JAPANESE SLAVES
THE sensational affidavit of John
M. Chretien accusing "Doc" Ed
ward Weatherly of having pro
duced the bogus heir to the Sulli
van estate has created marked in
terest among the police, attorneys, de
fendants and others interested in or con
nected with the scandalous case. Chretien
repeats that the" sworn statements are
absolutely the truth, but the police are
inclined to believe that he Is going as far
as.he dares to assist Fred Hansted. alias
"Young Dutchy," out of the serious pre
dicament into which he has thrown him
self. There is much to indicate, however,
that W'eatherly was deeply involved in
the conspiracy which has resulted so dis
astrously to those who schemed to rob
the dead and cheat the State.
"vTeatherly was constantly in the com
pany of Hansted and Chretien. The duties
of the scheming "Doc" as an attache of
a racetrack association and vagrant race
contributor to an evening sheet did not
interfere with his close relations with the
members of the probate ring. He was
with them counseling, suggesting and
urging. That he knew the character of
the scheme to rob the dead there Is no
question, and much plausibility attaches
therefore to the sworn statement of Chre
tien that the resourceful "Doc" "Weather
ly produced the heir whom all of the con-

Hansted Wants Vengeance.
Cook says he will not make the first
move in the leffal proceedings to determine
whether the Justices shall hold for two
or four years. He will pimply refuse to
give up his office and compel the can
didate elected to commence quo war
ranto proceedings. He believes the point
should be settled one way or the other by
the court. It is not known whether the
four other Justices will etand by Justice
Cook. Judge Barry is the only one who is
not a nominee and refuses to be a party
to the scheme. Judges Dunn, Groezineer
and Kerrigan are candidates, the two
former for Justices and the latter for Su
perior Judge. They all disavow that they
will participate in any attempt, should
they be defeated, to keep their successors
out of office. Cook is the only one who
openly announces his intention to do so.
Justice Cook contends that ae he was
elected at the f?rae time as the Governor
he goes out of office with the State's chief
executive. He holds the charter provision
which says that "Justices of the Peace

same time as members of the Legislature

Justice of the Peace Cook announced
yesterday that In the event of his defeat
for the office for which he Is a candidate
on the Citizens' Republican ticket he will
not give up his tenure thereof to either of
the five successful candidates. Cook will

however, of settling a disputed point and
eugeeeted that the matter be tested in
court. Cook will base his course in ho'.d

The Irregularity of the attendance of the
boys of the upper class of the Irving School
was noted as a detrimental feature. In a
separate school thorough schooling could be
given to irregular attendants for the time at
tended and the Incumbrance of classes be thus
avoided. If an effective law should be adopted
by the Legislature, securing for children their
educational rights, a school of this character
wou!d become a necessity. I have repeatedly
recommended the establishment of such a
school and I repeat my recommendation, trust
ing that the Board of Education will appreci
ate the necessity for the presence of such a
school and be" able to secure an appropriation
for Its establishment and maintenance next
year.
- The Lincoln Evening School, under the direc
tion of Principal A. II. MacDonald, is the larg
est evening school as to classes reported from
any city In the Union. Notwithstanding the
added ' responsibilities the principal has been
deprived of the much needed aid of his vice
principal. Mr. Plunkett, the latter having been
placed in charge of a class. I would recom
mend that the vice principal o? the Lincoln
Evening School be relieved from the teaching
of a class that he may aid the principal direct
ly. In office work and discipline no that the
supervision of the school may be more effec
tively attended to by the principal. Mr. Mac-
Honald is obliged to accert the constant at
tendance of his wife In the office work of the
school.
The resolution fixing Mrs. de Toe's
salary at $130 for the month of September,
she having served as cooking teacher dur
ing August without pay, was rescinded.
Mrs. de Yoe was thereupon appointed a
special teacher in cooking at a salary
of $71 50 per month, dating from Septern
ber 8, 1900.
The request of the Civil Service Com

In the Broadway Grammar School teachers
are endeavoring to their uttermost to comply
with all that Is required In the course of
study. One teacher found It necessary to ex
pend $12 for books* recommended to teachers.
This would ruggest that It would be well for
the department to furnish teachers' desks with
bc/oks which the course of study expects them
to use. In the eighth grade fifty-five pupils
were enrolled with fifty-three seats, one of
which was broken. Recitation benches are
wanted In this room. Fifty-three pupils are
enrolled in another room with fifty-three High
School desks, in place of which good intermedi
ate desks are desired.
At the Dudley Stone Primary School 42S
pvpils were found enrolled In eight classes. The
principal teaches In the different classes where
assistance Is needed the most. The Dudley
Stone and the Crocker schools are located In
a populous' and rapidly growing district, yet
there are fewer accommodations at these
schools now thai; there were two years ago.
with the result that parents have applied for
the admission of their children, but have not
been accommodated. Â»
The Crocker Grammar School has enrolled
725 pupils with thirteen teachers, an average
of over fifty-live pupils to the teacher. In this
crowded condition teachers cannot do the work
In the time allowed by the course. Recitations
In any particular subject can only be conduct
ed daily with a part of the class. The result
is that the work Is not satisfactory to the
teachers nor by any means to the best interest
of the pupils. This school betn^ so crowded
the principal does not teach any one subject,
but gives his time to the different classes so
as to assist those teachers who have the larg
est number of pupils to Instruct.
Superintendent of Schools Webster yes
terday directed the attention of the
Board of Education to the fact that three
teachers had been Irregularly assigned to
the substitute list. He stated that in plac
ing Miss M. F. Mooney and Miss Lucillo
O'Connell on that list a rule passed by
the last board had not been compiled
with. This rule provides that experience
in evening school service shall be regard
ed as one-half of -..similar experience
gained in day school work in determining
the average date of appointment. This
would change the date of appointment ot
Miss Mooney, who was elected as an
evening teacher and afterward trans
ferred to day service, from January 26,
1S98, to November 26, 1S98, and put her
last on the day unasslÂ«ned list. For simi
lar reasons Miss Lucille O'Connell's av
erage date of appointment should be Feb
ruary 26, 1S98, Instead of June 9, 18a?.
which would place her number 9 on the
unasslgned list lnstearl of 8 on the substi
tute list.
Again, Mrs. Miel, who is ninth on tha
substitute list, was elected a teacher of
sewing on July 28. 1897. Webster stated
that Mrs. Mlel was not certificated with
a primary certificate until September.
1S98, and she had no right to be regarded
as a regular teacher before that date.
Mrs. Miel should then be number 27 on th3
day unassigned list. The three teachers
who have thus been excluded from the
substitute list by reason of the irregu
larity are Miss M. Nolan. Miss M. A.
Wright and Miss R. Stack. They and Mls=
E. Cleary, all elected into the depart
ment on February 23, 1898, regis
tered complaints with Superintendent
Webster, who stated that they have a just
grievance. The fact that substitutes arc
paid $1 a day for reporting and J2 50 when
employed makes the irregularity of as
signing substitutes all the more appar
ent. Â»The board appeared ignorant of tho
rule quoted by WebsteriÂ» but promised to
take the matter under advisement.
An interesting document before the
meeting yesterday was a report read by
Superintendent Webster in which he con
tended that the board had not yet done
all that is necessary to relieve the con
gested attendance in the public schools.
He called attention to specific cases wheio
the enrollment Is In excess of tifty-flve
pupils, the limit fixed by the board. The
report follows:

"I don't care if he never comes back,"

knocking me senseless. , When I came to

i A friend of Mrs. Butterman named Sa
die Nupof went before Judge Cabaniss
and swore to a complaint charging the
unnatural father with falling to provide
for his minor children. To-day Captain
Seymour will communicate with the po
lice of Chicago -with a view of â¢ forcing
Butterman to provide for his babies.
Yesterday Mrs. Butterman, who Is the
mother of four children, visited police
headquarters and enlisted the* services of
Captain of Detectives Seymour to recover
the money her husband had stolen from
her.
Joseph Butterman, who formerly lived
at 220 Langton street, is being sought for
by the police. Several days ago, after
severely beating his wife, he robbed her
of all the money phe had. amounting to
$160. and then fled to Chicago, where he is
now supposed to be.

spirators knew to be an Impostor.
The publication in The Call yesterday
of Chretien's affidavit set the Police De
partment In Immediate action. Chief of
Detectives Seymour had been Informed
that Mrs. Weatherly was still in the city.
As a matter of fact he was under the im
pression that he had seen her himself.
He detailed a detective therefore to find
her and bring her to police headquarters.
The mission was fruitless, as Mrs. Weath
; erly is not in San Francisco. The detec
tive was told by the landlady at whose
house the Weatherlys formerly lived that
Mrs. Weatherly had left about two weeks
apo and had not been seen since. It was
supposed, however, that she had gone to
Chicago. As far as any one in this city
knows, "Doc" WeatheYly has gone to
London, where It is said he has relatives
of some standing.
The police will take no further action in
connection with the matter, nor is it likely
that the Grand Jury will do so. Chretien's
unsupported allegation that Weatherly
was the man who presented an impostor
as a rightful heir is not considered suffi
cient evidence upon which to base an in
dictment. Nor will there be any police
action in connection with Hansted's ac
cusation that "Weatherly has robbed him
of several thousand dollars, papers and
wearing apparel. "Young Dutchy" has
sworn to no complaint against "Doc"
Weatherly, and it will be only by such a
complaint that police machinery can be
6et in motion.
"Young Dutchy" says, however, that he
will have satisfaction upon Weatherly
even If he has to go to London to get it.
While "Young Dutchy" Is admitted to be
In such matter a man of his word, the in
teresting fact remains that he has a
pressing engagement to remain for a
period In the County Jail. After he has
had his seance with the criminal court he
may find an opportunity to cross the
ocean and take vengeance upon the elu
sive "Doc," â¢
"Young Dutchy" went through the for
mality yesterday of being arrested and
charged again. He was taken from the
County Jail to the City Prison and
charged upon the new indictment filed by
the Grand Jury. When this formality
had been concluded he was taken before
Chief of Detectives John Seymour and
told his story of how he says Weatherly
robbed him. His recital to Captain Sey
mour differed in no particular from that
published yesterday }n The Call. He seeks
to censure the officers of the County Jail
for not letting him out to look after his
properly, but his Idea of his personal
privileges and that held by the officers
differ very materially. It is likely that
when "Young Dutchy" is tried Chretien
will be his most Important witness.
There Is a slight indication that the Bar
Association is awakening .to a sense of
Its duty in reference to James Taylor
Rogers, the lawyer who was so notorious
ly connected with the Sullivan estate. It
is said that the association at its next
meeting will consider the recommenda
tion of the Grand Jury to Institute dis
barment proceedings against Rogers. De
cent public opinion has demanded such a
step for months. Laymen and lawyers
alike have Insisted that the Bar Associa
tion was staining Its own character by
doing nothing, but criticism and censure
have been alike without avail. It is en
couraging, therefore, that the .Bar, Asso
ciation will at least discuss the question
whether or not Rogers is a. fit man to
practice In the. courts of this State.
While lawyers and defendants are busy
in the criminal courts and in -the prison
Attorney General Ford is preparing to
take a step which will have the property
of Joseph Sullivan escheat to the State.
